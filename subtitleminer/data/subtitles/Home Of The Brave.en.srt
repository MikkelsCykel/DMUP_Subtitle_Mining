00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,040
Pass. Here.

2
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,960
Almost done.

3
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,840
I have to do this.

4
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,640
Excuse me, sir.

5
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,600
- Can you help out here?
- Yes, sir.

6
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,480
It'll be okay. It'll be okay.

7
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,200
Have you heard the news, sir?

8
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,800
- What news is that?
- It's official.

9
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,880
We're headed out in two weeks, sir.

10
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,280
- No extension?
- Not this time, sir.

11
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,880
You hear that?

12
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,120
I'm going home.

13
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,000
Shebooya!

14
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,080
Just like home.

15
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,680
See what you got? Come on, Tom.

16
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,040
Where you going? Where you going?

17
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,920
Yeah, baby.

18
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,320
Yeah.

19
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,360
Bullshit.
You all run the same bullshit play.

20
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,080
Hey, you know the first thing
I'm gonna do when I get home?

21
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,520
Go get that herpes treated, right?

22
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,120
I'm gonna get some from your mama.
Then get my herpes treated.

23
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,720
Hey, what about Keisha?

24
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,000
Come over here
and sit on Daddy's anaconda.

25
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,160
- Play with the anaconda...
- I'll kick your white asses.

26
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,560
- All right, here we go. Here we go.
- He said he'd give me...

27
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,240
This is for Keisha.

28
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,200
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!
- I got it! I got it! Oh, shit!

29
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,360
Deep, deep!
He's wide open, he's wide open!

30
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,960
Touchdown, baby!

31
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,560
- There you are.
- So easy, so free.

32
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,960
Hey, Tommy.

33
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,400
What about you, Daydream?

34
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,800
- What're you gonna do?
- I don't know.

35
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,600
Maybe go rock climbing on Boulder Beach.

36
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,480
- Smoke a bowl.
- Maybe that, too.

37
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,720
I don't know, man.

38
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,360
Maybe buy a house, fix it up.
Something good.

39
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,880
- Now he gonna fix some shit.
- He's been fixing shit his entire life.

40
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,560
You know what? Fuck you.

41
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,040
Okay. Hey! Oh, hey, come on. Come on.

42
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,000
It's gonna be a couple of weeks
for demobilization

43
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,520
back Stateside and all, but...

44
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,960
No, it's for real.

45
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,360
No, Mom, I said, I said...

46
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,800
What're you doing?

47
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,960
What are you feeding him?

48
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,960
Mom, come on, something healthy.
I mean, a carrot or something.

49
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,720
Can you just put Ray on?

50
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,280
Hey, sweetheart.

51
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,360
Yeah, I'm coming home.

52
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,320
What else do you got?

53
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,240
All right. You got two boxes?
Put them in the back.

54
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,320
Hey, Jamal.
Let's load this bad boy up.

55
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,520
- What the hell is this?
- Fell off the truck this morning.

56
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,240
Wrestled it off of three guys.

57
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,720
My mom's Honda has better fucking doors
than this piece of shit.

58
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,440
No! No, no fucking way. No!

59
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,840
Hey, everybody's got one now.
It's the only way they're gonna learn.

60
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,560
No, no, no. Not this guy. He's bad news.

61
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,920
He was in the Fallujah run in July.
He was with Mendocino and Shirley.

62
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,400
- You know that!
- Hey, we get what we get, bitch.

63
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,480
Let's load up.

64
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,280
Motherfucker, you're as useless as an
ashtray on a motorcycle, you know that?

65
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,880
Hey! Hey, Owens!

66
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,160
Hey, guys, gather around, gather around.

67
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,760
- Change of plans for today.
- Change of plans?

68
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,440
What? No recon?

69
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,200
Negative, supply run.

70
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,840
Humanitarian.

71
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,200
We're escorting a convoy of
medical supplies and a doctor to Al Hayy.

72
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,680
- What the fuck's Jefferson doing?
- Yeah. Where the fuck is he going?

73
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,560
Security run to Al-Najaf.

74
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,760
Oh, come on, Sarge.

75
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,960
Yeah, regular army
gets all the good shit.

76
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,720
It's all bullshit.
- Hey!

77
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,440
This is some
good hearts and minds shit, men.

78
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,880
We'll be providing medical supplies
and good will to the Iraqi people

79
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,080
on behalf of the United States military
and its citizens.

80
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,800
Shut the fuck up and look at the map!

81
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,280
Where're we going, Sarge?

82
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,520
What kind of clinic is it, sir?

83
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,600
It's probably just physicals.

84
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,480
The Iraqis need them for work, the army.

85
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,040
Whatever.

86
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,640
It's your first time
outside the wire, Specialist?

87
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,000
Yes, sir.

88
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,000
You'll be all right.

89
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,240
I can't wait to get home.
I can't wait to see Ray.

90
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,800
Yeah, well.
And your son's gotten bigger, huh?

91
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,880
Oh, my God. I've missed so much.

92
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,960
Attention, all vehicles,
Al Hayy, 15 klicks over the ridge, Over,

93
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,360
Roger that.

94
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,320
Hey, Al Hayy's up ahead, boys.

95
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,760
We drive through
and we're 10K from supply drop.

96
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,360
Al Hayy ahead!

97
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,440
Copy that!

98
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,880
Al Hayy was the center of 1956 uprising.

99
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,160
Holy shit, the haji speaks?

100
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,280
Hear that, Tommy? He speaks English.

101
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,040
You do good out there today,
you get 10 minutes

102
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,280
in the latrine with us, all right?

103
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,120
Hey, hey. Let's stay focused.
Come on, no sleeping.

104
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,320
It's the other way!
- Right there.

105
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,000
- Keep your hands where I can see them.
- It's the other way.

106
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,160
Hey, hey, right there. Right there.

107
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,000
Be ready! Be ready! Be ready!

108
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,160
Turn around. Keep going.

109
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,560
Why you pushing?
Why you pushing?

110
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,600
Leave it alone.

111
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,680
I'm on a mission here.

112
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,280
What's wrong,
what's wrong with you?

113
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,760
I'm sorry, Ma'am.

114
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,200
Pull that up, please.

115
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,120
I have to make sure
you don't have any weapons.

116
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,520
Ten miles an hour
is plenty, You got time to...

117
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,800
Keep your air holes, Don't bunch up,

118
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,720
These humanitarian runs, man.
I don't like them.

119
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,160
I'll tell you what,
always putting ourselves in danger.

120
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,320
No, I think we're all right.

121
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,440
Son of a bitch!
That's all we need. Give him room.

122
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,880
Give him room, Don't butt up on him,

123
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,280
Damn it.

124
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,920
All right, convoy, halt, Convoy, halt,

125
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,000
- Gunners, stay watching dismounts,
- Shit!

126
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,200
Hey, move!

127
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,400
Get this truck out of the way,

128
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,840
Get the fuck out of the way!

129
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,040
Get this truck out of here,

130
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,160
I said move.

131
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,200
Move!

132
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,280
It's not good.

133
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,920
Hey. On your right.

134
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,960
- I got him. I got him.
- Move the car out!

135
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,120
- Move the truck!
- Let's go!

136
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,080
Go to the back. Just be ready!

137
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,320
- Move!
- Let's go! Move! Move!

138
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,320
Where's the interpreter?

139
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,320
Come on, let's go, We don't have all day,

140
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,240
Kamal, go tell them
to get the fuck out the way.

141
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,920
- Move! Move! Move!
- Come on, Kamal, get going.

142
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,680
Let's go.

143
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,280
Move it!

144
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,920
Kamal!

145
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,080
Take cover! Take cover!

146
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,800
Get down!

147
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,640
- Jesus Christ! Shit!
- Did one of the gunners get shot?

148
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,000
Come on, get out, get out, get out!

149
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,440
- Jordan!
- Here!

150
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,960
Oh, my God!

151
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,760
Holy shit!

152
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,040
- It's okay! Back up! Back up! Back up!
- I'm trying!

153
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,120
Let's get out of here!

154
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,520
- Let's get out of here!
- Okay.

155
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,840
- Okay.

156
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,200
- Okay, okay, okay!
- Go left!

157
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,160
Second squad,
move into Y-intersection.

158
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,840
- Boy! Boy!
- Charlie team, secure for...

We've got to get back to the main road.

190
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,200
Looks like if we hang a right

Okay.

- I remember.

319
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,480
You want the one with cheese, honey?

320
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,240
Baby, how about you help
Mommy cut up the fruit?

321
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,040
- I wanna stay with Daddy.
- Daddy's busy right now.

322
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,080
- Come on, honey.
- Where's Billy?

323
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,640
I think he went out.

324
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,920
Went to counsel four years ago,
but...

325
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,480
And there was such a backlog
they forgot all about it.

326
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,360
So they finally put it down
and it's a two-way, not a four-way.

327
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,960
- Unbelievable.
- I know.

328
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,160
Do those people know
what they're doing down there?

329
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,200
They don't.

330
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,720
Is that baby kicking yet?
- Oh, yes, he is.

331
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,320
When he's hungry.

332
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,240
- Dad, how's the food?
- It's lovely.

333
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,600
- We're gonna cut into that cake soon.
- Yeah, looks great. I'll have some.

334
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,080
Not yet. Not yet.

335
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,720
I'm going inside for a minute.
Anybody need anything?

336
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,160
- No, I'm great, thanks.
- No, thanks.

337
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,640
- So.
- Just back this morning, huh?

338
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,120
Yeah, four hours ago.

339
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,400
He looks great.

340
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,120
Attention!

341
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,640
Present!

342
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,520
Attention!

343
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,760
- Hi.
- Hey.

344
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,560
It's good to see you.

345
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,520
We'll be inside.

346
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,280
Hey, what's up?

347
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,200
Hey, Tom.

348
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,880
Hey.

349
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,000
Hi.

350
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,920
Where's Molly?

351
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,400
We're not together.

352
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,520
Dear John letter.

353
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,160
You know how that goes.

354
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,480
You look different.

355
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,560
- Older?
- Your eyes. They...

356
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:42,040
It's like they're looking over my shoulder,
you know?

357
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,280
Sadder, maybe.

358
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,760
Sorry.

359
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,880
Was he a hero, Tommy?

360
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,080
He died defending his country.

361
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,320
That doesn't answer my question.

362
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,080
- It's the truth.
- Stop it.

363
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,000
- You don't believe that.
- Of course I do.

364
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,280
He was doing his job.

365
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,480
And he was damn good at it.

366
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,720
Sorry.

367
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,400
He's cute.

368
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,440
When's he coming to see you?

369
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,240
- I don't know.
- What?

370
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:28,120
He is fine. If you don't want him,

371
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,000
then send him my way.

372
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,040
Are you ready for therapy?

373
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,160
Do I have a choice?

374
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,200
Not if you wanna get out of here.

375
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,200
Everything's gonna be okay.

376
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,240
They'll page me when you're done.
Good luck.

377
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,480
Jordan had this stuff sent to me.

378
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,880
I'm not sure why, but...

379
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,800
Well, you were his buddy.

380
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,600
He loved you, too, right?

381
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,400
Right.

382
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,640
God.

383
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,680
I always hated this picture.

384
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,600
He carried that with him
everywhere he went.

385
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,680
God.

386
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,320
What's this?

387
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,480
This is called a God's eye.

388
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Some kid in Baghdad gave it to him.

389
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,920
- An Iraqi kid?
- Yeah.

390
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,000
I thought they all hated us.

391
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,600
Not all of them.

392
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,920
What's this one?

393
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,160
It's the Combat Infantry Badge.

394
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,720
These other two right here,

395
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:36,760
they're from letters of recommendation
but this is the CIB.

396
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,920
It's one all the soldiers wanted.

397
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,560
Means you fought hard.

398
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,680
I gave this to him.

399
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,480
There she is.

400
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,280
Vanessa!

401
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,760
Hi, honey.

402
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,320
You look so grown up.

403
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,240
Can you say "Hi" to Mommy?

404
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,920
Yeah? Can you say "Hi" to Mommy?

405
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,280
You look so thin.

406
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,600
Hey.

407
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,920
You look great.

408
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,400
Yeah, Ray, right.

409
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,920
Crackers are coming.

410
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,240
What is the matter, Ray?

411
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,960
How's it going?
Has everybody got everything?

412
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:17,960
Ray, crackers.

413
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,040
Yeah, the crackers.
Yes, they are right here.

414
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,080
I'm sorry about that.

415
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:50,160
Dede, that's really good
how you stay inside the lines now.

416
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,000
- Thank you, Daddy.
I'm out.

417
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,280
You're gonna be late.

418
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,880
Davis is picking me up. I'll eat in the car.

419
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,840
Seahawks have a game
against the Patriots Sunday night.

420
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,560
Perhaps you two should go.

421
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,080
Both of them suck this year.

422
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,480
Well, then maybe Dr. Benton
won't be using his tickets.

423
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,400
We can get the same ones
we had last year, 10 rows up, 50-yard line,

424
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,600
- spend the night in the city.
- I'm busy.

425
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,000
Busy doing what?

426
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,800
Thought you liked football.

427
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,760
Did you read that in
one of your brochures or something?

428
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,080
"Invite your child on favorite activities,

429
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,080
"and re-establish familiar bonds."

430
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,080
- Billy, what's gotten into you?
- Mom!

431
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,360
Give me a break.

432
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,400
You guys are so obvious.

433
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,800
I'm out.

434
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,640
- Dede, go get your knapsack.
- But I want Daddy to get it.

435
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,000
Now, sweetheart.

436
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,880
You all right?

437
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,120
Yeah, sure.

438
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,640
Did you sleep at all?

439
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,280
Yeah.

440
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,120
No, honestly, I did.

441
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,080
- See you later.
- Okay.

442
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:19,240
The faculty wanted to do something,
but we weren't really sure...

443
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,640
It's okay, really.

444
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,000
You sure you're ready for this?

445
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,600
Yes, sir, I'm ready.

446
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,360
Well, good luck.

447
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,560
You were gone a while, Tommy.

448
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,160
- Like a year.
- Fifteen months, actually.

449
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:12,200
There's kind of a law that says
you have to hold my job until I get back.

450
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,680
But I hired someone else.

451
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,640
I had to. You were full-time.

452
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,960
That's the point, Zander.
This was my full-time job.

453
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,120
You knew I was coming back eventually.

454
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,440
I guess. I hoped so.

455
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,520
You know what I mean.

456
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,480
- Yeah.
- Look, Tommy,

457
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,360
I only have four employees.

458
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,280
You know that.
What did you think I was gonna do?

459
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,720
Look, I'll put a word in
with Tyson over at REl.

460
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,360
No, don't worry about it.

461
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:38,960
I need to find something
closer to home anyway.

462
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,560
Since I'm not gonna
be crashing at Molly's anymore.

463
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,720
I'm real sorry, man.

464
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,760
Yeah, it's cool.

465
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,760
You sure, now?

466
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:51,920
'Cause I don't want you going
all psycho on me or anything.

467
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:56,000
So how was it? You shoot anybody?

468
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,880
Yeah, I did.

469
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,640
Did you kill anybody?

470
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,440
I don't know, Zander.
I didn't stick around to find out.

471
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,080
It's war.

472
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,720
- Look, man, I gotta...
- Sure.

473
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,360
Look, you come back whenever, okay?

474
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,280
10% off. Military discount.

475
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,960
10%.

476
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,040
Brock's Gun Shop. This is Zander.

477
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,120
No. No, I'm sorry. We're all out of those.
I can get them for you next week.

478
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:33,360
Take any of the brochures now or you
can come down to the recruitment center

479
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:37,680
as we'd love to have you
in the Army family.

480
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,760
Shit!

481
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,920
Hey, let me give you a hand.

482
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,400
- It's all right. It's all right. It's okay.
- I got it. It's all right.

483
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,720
Just some mud on there.

484
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,240
It's okay. It's okay.

485
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,600
You must be Vanessa Price.

486
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,440
Well, what gave that away?

487
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,240
I'm Cary Wilkens.

488
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:09,120
I teach boys' P.E., but I've been teaching
your girls the last eight weeks.

489
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,160
Long day?

490
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,400
Yeah. Takes some getting used to.

491
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,960
So, you wanna grab a cup of coffee
or something?

492
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,280
I could fill you in on your students...

493
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,320
- I don't think so. But thanks.
- You sure?

494
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,040
- Yeah. No, I'm sure.
- You know, some kids are mean...

495
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:26,960
Okay.

496
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,680
I got it. I got this.

497
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,840
- Just trying to help.
- I know, but I got it.

498
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,400
It's nice to meet you, Vanessa.

499
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:43,840
Fuck!

500
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,880
Will?

501
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:13,800
Scott Martinez hit a homerun
in the 15th inning, won the game.

502
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,960
Five hours. Unbelievable.

503
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,680
Come back to bed, baby.

504
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,760
Can't sleep.

505
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,200
Don't you have surgery
tomorrow morning?

506
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,400
Will, what happened over there?

507
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,000
I don't really remember.
You know, it's like a dream.

508
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,120
Hazy dream.

509
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,280
Then tell me.

510
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,240
I wanna know.

511
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,680
Do you?

512
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,240
Wanna know
what a blast wound looks like?

513
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,720
What an OR in the desert smells like?

514
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,520
What really happens to them?

515
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,040
How they die?

516
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,920
You really wanna know?

517
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,280
You want us to come back
like nothing ever happened.

518
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,840
You don't want to get your hands dirty
with the details.

519
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,400
That's not fair at all.

520
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,720
Do you really think I don't care?

521
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,920
If you wanna tell me, then tell me.
And maybe you're right.

522
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,200
Maybe I don't wanna hear about
what happened to the rest of them.

523
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,480
But I would like to know
what happened to you.

524
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,040
Two tickets. Here you go.

525
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,280
There you go,

526
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,120
- Hi.
- Hey. How are you?

527
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,520
Good, thanks.

528
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:57,880
Two adults and one child for
Forever Lulu at 1:30.

529
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,200
All right.

530
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,560
Okay, That is $20,50,

531
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,520
Okay.

532
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:11,440
Out of $21. There you go.

533
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,480
I know you.

534
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,160
181st?

535
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,560
Bravo Company,

536
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,560
First of the 161st,

537
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,400
951st Maintenance Company.

538
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,720
Hua,

539
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,200
Hua.

540
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,720
You wanna go in
and I'll be there in just a minute?

541
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,800
I'll go... I'll be in right after you. Okay.

542
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,080
Don't worry.
I checked for snipers a couple hours ago.

543
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,640
Jesus.

544
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,920
- Cute kid.
- Thanks.

545
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,520
One day he acts up
like you wouldn't believe

546
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,120
and then the next he won't let me
out of his sight.

547
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,280
So how you doing?

548
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,960
Okay.

549
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,280
I lost my best friend over there.

550
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,120
- God, I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

551
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,280
It's been pretty tough since...

552
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,680
Fuck.

553
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,520
They changed up my medication.
It makes me all weepy.

554
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,520
- Zoloft?
- Lexapro.

555
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,720
- Really? That makes me way too anxious.
- Really?

556
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,840
I had that problem with Risperdal.

557
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,000
- Vicodin?
- Every now and again.

558
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,800
But I was actually on Resperidone,
but then I got moved to Celexa.

559
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,560
Now I take Ambien for sleeping.

560
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:25,000
Ambien? Now come on.
Trazodone all the way.

561
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,240
Would you listen to us?

562
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,400
We sound like a couple of junkies.

563
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,200
You know,
sometimes I can't sleep at night.

564
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,920
- Yeah.
- So I flip it over to The History Channel.

565
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,440
I love The History Channel.

566
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,320
- You watch The History Channel?
- Yeah.

567
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,880
The other night, it was like 4:00 a.m.,

568
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,400
and they had this special
on D-day and Normandy, okay?

569
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:49,880
And it was like, about these small towns,
Caen and Bayeux,

570
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:53,400
and how they loved Americans
and they loved Allied soldiers.

571
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,000
And they have statues of Eisenhower

572
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,160
and plaques thanking the Americans.

573
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,240
I don't know, I just started thinking that...

574
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:05,040
I mean, what if like 10, 15 years from now,
we go back...

575
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,920
Do you think that they'll
have statues thanking us

576
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,320
and plaques and...

577
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,920
'Cause we saved them, we liberated them.

578
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,120
Right.

579
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,160
I don't know.

580
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,440
Yeah.

581
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,120
I don't know, either.

582
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:23,640
You know,
I work at this fucking movie theater

583
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:26,800
and sell these stupid tickets
for these stupid movies.

584
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,600
But I don't ever go see any of them.

585
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,920
Just seems all so unimportant, you know?

586
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,840
Yeah, I know exactly what you mean.

587
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:38,960
I mean, I see all these people
driving these gas-guzzling SUVs,

588
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,880
getting their Frappuccinos from Starbucks.

589
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,800
Doing all this crap with their normal lives,

590
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,200
and they don't give a shit
what's going on over there.

591
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:49,920
Yeah. I gotta tell you it makes me wanna
go back there so goddamn bad.

592
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,200
I know what you mean.

593
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,320
I mean, I barely know you.

594
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,440
But I'm sitting here with you

595
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,520
and I feel like I've known you
my entire life.

596
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:01,640
Yeah.

597
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:04,240
And then there's all those people
that I actually do really know.

598
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,200
And now, I just don't feel
like I know them at all.

599
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,960
I feel the exact same way.

600
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,760
It's like nothing makes any sense
anymore, does it?

601
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,880
Yeah.

602
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,720
On D-Day,
behind Bradley's first army,

603
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,520
another army is sent,

604
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:18,920
Patton's third,

605
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,400
He told them to get mad and stay mad,

606
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,200
They listened,

607
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,000
Giving credit, instilling pride,

608
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,360
urging men to even greater deeds,

609
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,480
Then, the green light,

610
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,840
Kidding me.
Watch where you're fucking going!

611
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,320
Fuck with me.

612
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,400
Get the fuck out of the way!

613
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,480
You fucking turn?

614
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,080
Who is this guy?

615
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:55,960
Oh, Jesus.

616
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,520
Shit.

617
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,120
- Good morning, sweetheart.
- What's up?

618
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:15,720
- Hey.
- Nice uniform.

619
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:16,960
At least I won't get shot at.

620
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,840
Depends on the movie theater.

621
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,360
- He's in back.
- Back.

622
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:25,200
Damn it.

623
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,040
I'll take a look.

624
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,480
Hey, old man.

625
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,280
Hey, Mike Falcone call you?

626
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,080
Yeah. Said there's another exam
a week from Saturday.

627
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:34,120
And than I take the physical
when my leg gets better.

628
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:35,640
That sounds good, Tommy.

629
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,440
- We'll see, I guess.
- Look. Come on. Police is a good job.

630
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,440
Did me right for 25 years.

631
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:43,360
- Serving popcorn is no career.
- Yeah. Yeah, I know.

632
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:44,600
Look, you stay on top of it.

633
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,440
$15,000 saved up
isn't going to last forever.

634
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,640
Hey, Pop, I'm doing it. All right? Relax.

635
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:56,440
Your mother comes into your room
sometimes at night and you're not there.

636
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:57,960
I like to drive around.

637
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:00,360
- In the middle of the night?
- Yeah.

638
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:04,800
You know, I...

639
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:07,240
I've been thinking about
going and talking to someone.

640
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:09,440
About what? Your feelings?

641
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,960
- You sound like your mother.
- No! No, I just think of a lot of shit...

642
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,240
Why don't you wait
until you get the police job?

643
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:16,520
Because they'll find out.

644
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,840
And you don't want them
thinking you're a pussy.

645
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:21,640
What are you saying?
'Cause I'm not a pussy.

646
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:48,880
Hey, buddy.

647
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,680
What do you got?

648
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:54,280
What is that? Hi. Hi. Hi.

649
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:59,200
- Hey.
- Hi.

650
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:03,360
- Hey, babe. How're you doing?
- Hey. Good.

651
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:05,960
Hot, hot, hot, hot.

652
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:07,640
Not bad, huh?

653
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,800
Ray's staying for dinner.

654
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,800
No, tonight's not a good night, actually.

655
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,840
I'm just... I'm really tired.

656
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:19,080
So, if we can just do it another time.

657
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:21,920
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

658
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:23,600
Sure.

659
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:28,000
I'm gonna give you a call later,
though, okay?

660
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,000
- Yeah.
- Okay.

661
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:32,000
Thanks, Alice.

662
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:34,720
See you, kid.

663
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:23,560
Mommy.

664
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:25,320
Get out of here, Oliver.

665
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:26,800
But it's Ray.

666
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,200
Tell him I'll call him back.

667
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:42,880
We turned the. 50 cals on him.

668
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:44,480
And he doesn't stop.

669
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:46,720
He's coming right at us.

670
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:50,480
He could have a bomb. We don't know.

671
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,520
There's no way to know.

672
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,240
But he doesn't stop.

673
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:01,760
So I open fire.

674
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:05,000
I have no choice.

675
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:07,000
I tear him up.

676
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,520
It's him or us, right?

677
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:16,160
Then we drove by fast as hell
and I looked back to see if I got him.

678
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:18,800
Then we were gone.

679
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,960
And you still think about it?
- Yeah.

680
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:27,880
Whether I really saw
a woman, a girl and a baby all shot up...

681
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:30,520
- So what's your problem then?
- What do you mean?

682
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,440
You did what was right.

683
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,680
The rules of war were followed.
There was an imminent threat.

684
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,640
Haji didn't get the memo. Get over it.

685
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:38,760
It's not always that simple.

686
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:40,320
This is bullshit, man.

687
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:42,680
They told me this was a class.
I want information.

688
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:44,760
I need my discharge paperwork
and help with that,

689
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:46,840
my disability applications
and help with that.

690
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,200
Some people think this is helpful.

691
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,200
Whatever.

692
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,680
You've got everything under control,
right, son?

693
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,680
When did you serve, Gettysburg?

694
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,040
Saigon.

695
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:00,240
Jesus.

696
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,160
Thirty years out?

697
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:06,000
No way in hell
I'm gonna be coming back here.

698
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:07,880
You're obviously angry, Jamal.

699
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,920
- Do you wanna tell us why?
- No, why don't you tell me why.

700
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:12,760
Why what?

701
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:15,280
Why I get these headaches
and I still can't sleep right.

702
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:18,120
Why I can't walk right
because my back's still fucked up.

703
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:21,160
Why Keisha wouldn't kiss me
the first two months I was home?

704
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:24,120
Why it takes the army six weeks
to set the medical for my discharge

705
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:27,000
and they canceled it and they
rescheduled it and then canceled it again?

706
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:29,840
Why I can't look at you right now
without wanting to kick your face in?

707
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:32,000
- Especially you, Doc.
- Hey, Jamal, Jamal.

708
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:33,040
What the hell happened to you, man?

709
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:34,320
What, you want to
pile some shit on me, too, Tommy?

710
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:35,520
No, I'm not trying to pile anything on you.

711
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,120
What the hell are you doing here?

712
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:38,840
Tommy Daydream, ladies and gentlemen.

713
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,240
Movie-star looks and a future so bright.

714
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:43,280
- You two know each other?
- Tell him.

715
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:45,760
Tell him. Tommy takes one in the leg.

716
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:47,880
His buddy gets a dozen in the chest.

717
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:50,280
Well, God smiles down
on Tommy Daydream.

718
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:55,880
Fuck you, Jamal. Fuck you.

719
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:58,600
Fuck me? No, fuck you.

720
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,400
Yeah, go ahead. Get out.

721
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:02,040
Get the fuck out.

722
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:04,560
Get your own goddamn group.

723
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:06,400
This is my goddamn group.

724
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,600
Nobody else ain't got nothing else
they wanna say?

725
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,240
How's that?

726
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:21,880
That hurts.

727
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:24,040
I'm having pain all the time.

728
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:26,040
- Pain or discomfort?
- Pain.

729
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,560
Because discomfort
is nothing to worry about.

730
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:33,040
Right there.

731
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:37,000
All right. It's probably the prosthesis.

732
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:38,760
We can try and adjust it.

733
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:40,360
Thank you.

734
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:44,080
And I can prescribe some medication
to help with these phantom pains.

735
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:45,880
No more medication.

736
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:48,880
It's up to you.

737
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:52,760
These just came in.
You wanna take a look at that?

738
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,640
I'll recommend
some more therapy as well.

739
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:03,720
What the hell is this?

740
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:05,640
Take a look at the last one.

741
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:07,200
Fishing attachment?

742
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:09,520
$21,000?

743
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:11,760
Don't worry about it.
The army will pay for it.

744
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,360
As many as you need.

745
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:17,600
Might be something that you and your
boyfriend or husband can do together.

746
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,440
Help you pass the time.

747
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:26,160
Do you think they have one
where you can give people the finger?

748
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:29,600
Or, maybe a flat palm with a spike in it?

749
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:33,320
You know,
for when I smack my kid around.

750
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,520
Because when I really
put my shoulder into this,

751
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:37,640
this thing just goes flying across the room.

752
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:40,040
It's kind of getting to be
a little bit of a problem, Doc, you know?

753
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:42,520
Because if I could just keep my kid in line,

754
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:44,520
and not have to go digging for this thing

755
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:48,520
then maybe, just maybe, I'd have
a little bit more time for some fly-fishing.

756
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,400
Thank you. No, thank you.

757
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:54,600
It's your choice.

758
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:06,520
Vanessa! Hey!

759
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:09,000
Ray, what are you doing here?

760
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:10,440
Your mom told me where you were.

761
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,880
- Vanessa, this is crazy.
- I just gotta go.

762
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:15,800
Why don't you return my calls?

763
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:18,320
Ray, you know why.

764
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:19,760
No, I don't.

765
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:21,320
I really don't.

766
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:24,600
Wait a minute.

767
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:26,800
Please, don't just walk away.

768
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:28,440
It's over, Ray.

769
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:31,000
- It's over. Don't you get it?
- What did I do?

770
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:33,080
At least tell me that. What did I do?

771
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:35,480
It's not about you, it's about me.

772
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:39,040
Okay. You wanna be alone? Fine.

773
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,760
I've tried comforting you,
I've tried giving you space.

774
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:45,280
But you are just so damn determined
to be pissed off at the world!

775
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:50,160
I guess it only takes
one good hand to push people away.

776
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:52,840
Take care of yourself, Vanessa.

777
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:02,280
Levels are good, steady.

778
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,800
- Knife.
- Doctor.

779
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:08,040
Retraction.

780
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:11,880
- Are you feeling all right, Doctor?
- Respiration's steady.

781
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:15,040
I am feeling a bit under the weather.

782
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,160
Dr. Breeder,
would you finish for me, please?

783
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:18,680
- Yes, certainly.
- Thank you.

784
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:51,760
Dr. Marsh?

785
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:53,960
There's a Vanessa Price here to see you.

786
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:56,520
- Who?
- She says she knows you from Iraq.

787
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:06,080
Oh, my God!

788
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:08,080
- Hi.
- It's good to see you.

789
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:09,480
- Come in.
- You, too. Thanks.

790
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:14,400
Thank you.

791
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:17,760
How are you? Are you all right?

792
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:19,720
Yeah, everything's fine.

793
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:21,960
I had an appointment
at the V.A. Hospital this morning,

794
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:24,200
and one of the nurses there
gave me your address.

795
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:26,920
- Everything all right?
- Yeah, it's fine. It's fine.

796
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:31,800
I just... I thought about you, and I realized
that you were in the neighborhood.

797
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:33,720
So I took the day off of work and thought,

798
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:36,200
"Well, you know,
today I'm gonna do doctors."

799
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:38,280
So,

800
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,440
they couldn't save it, then.

801
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:44,080
No. No. FST took it off.

802
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:48,320
I spent the night in Baghdad,
and then went over to Landstuhl.

803
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:51,120
I mean, I don't remember it. It's just...
It's just what they told me.

804
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:53,280
- Then to Walter Reed?
- Yup.

805
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:55,320
Walter Reed for a month,

806
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:57,400
fitted, and then back home.

807
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,160
Walter Reed. Right?

808
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:01,360
You wanna see some tough Americans.

809
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:03,200
- Yeah, I can imagine.
- Yeah.

810
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,440
But I mean, I'm one of the lucky ones.

811
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:08,200
I got my legs, I got most of my arms...

812
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:10,720
I can hold my kid and I...

813
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:12,720
And I really try to remember that.

814
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:14,840
You must've seen a lot
while you were there.

815
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:16,480
Yeah, I saw a lot.

816
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:21,320
You really look good.

817
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:22,880
Thanks.

818
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:27,480
You know, at Walter Reed,
they took us on these outings

819
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:30,160
to help us, you know,
kind of, get used to it.

820
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:33,680
And people would thank us,
and then, you know, they would stare,

821
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:35,480
and that would make me really,
really angry.

822
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:38,880
And then they would ignore me
and it would make me really angry.

823
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:43,000
- I just... I don't know...
- Do you need anything?

824
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,360
Prescription?

825
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:47,920
Jesus, everybody's just trying to drug me.

826
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,160
Oh, Jesus. I'm sorry.
Look, I just thought maybe...

827
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,000
I'm... I'm really not here for that.

828
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:57,280
I just, you know,
I really just wanted to see your face again.

829
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:01,840
You're a hero. At least to me.

830
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:05,880
Thank you.

831
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:09,400
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

832
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:11,520
Dr. Marsh.

833
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:14,040
What?

834
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:17,920
Is he there now?

835
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,920
Okay. All right, I'll be right over.

836
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:27,440
I'm sorry, I have to go.

837
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:30,440
It's good to see you.

838
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:31,800
Thanks. You, too.

839
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:35,160
If you're ever in the neighborhood again,
you need anything,

840
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,400
you know, call me, stop by.

841
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:38,920
Thank you.

842
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:43,000
The conduct policy's very clear.

843
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:46,040
No baseball caps, no cell phones,

844
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:47,880
no clothing with
offensive pictures or slogans.

845
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:49,160
No clothing with
offensive pictures or slogans.

846
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:51,360
Show them.

847
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:55,080
Where did you get that?

848
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:56,920
The mall. What's the big deal?

849
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:00,440
We have teachers here who have friends
and loved ones who've served in Iraq.

850
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:03,080
They were quite upset.
We can't have this here.

851
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:05,120
- Well, actually, my husband's...
- Can't have what, opposition?

852
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:06,960
The garment is offensive, Dr. Marsh.

853
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:08,640
Of course it is. That's the point.

854
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:11,880
If you want to raise your children
to oppose American institutions,

855
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:13,720
I guess that's entirely your right.

856
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:16,560
But this is a public school
and we have rules.

857
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:18,680
Okay, so why don't we have him
take it off right now,

858
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:20,760
you call an assembly and you can burn it,

859
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:23,200
along with some books from the library
and today's newspaper.

860
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:24,440
- Will...
- And while we're at it,

861
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:26,640
let's get a list of all the students
who are opposed to the war,

862
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:29,560
make them come to school on Saturday
and take patriotism classes

863
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:31,560
and monitor their e-mails
and their cell-phone calls.

864
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:32,600
Dr. Marsh!

865
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:33,960
Buck Fush?

866
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:37,360
Buck you, you son of a bitch.

867
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:39,320
- Will!
- Let's go. Come on.

868
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:40,960
Come on.

869
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:49,920
Hey, that was really cool, Dad.

870
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,160
Yeah, well, you're grounded for a month.

871
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:53,280
What?

872
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:55,800
We'll talk about it when we get home.

873
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:57,800
So you're against the war, huh?

874
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:59,840
You don't know a damn thing about it.

875
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:02,560
It's not a war, it's an occupation.
They hate us.

876
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:04,640
They're trying to build a country.

877
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:06,840
We did the same thing here
a couple of hundred years ago.

878
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,800
- It's not easy.
- Yeah. Right.

879
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:10,480
And we're doing a good job at it.

880
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:13,520
Maybe if we flushed a couple more
Korans down a toilet in Guantnamo,

881
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:15,120
it'd help them speed things up.

882
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:17,520
So you think we should just leave, huh?

883
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:19,920
Let them rip each other to pieces?

884
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:22,760
It's not an easy decision, is it?

885
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:24,240
Some bad guys over there, Billy.

886
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:26,320
Dad, what bad guys?
What is this, a Schwarzenegger movie?

887
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,080
- Hey.
- Why don't you just admit it,

888
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:30,800
we went over there for oil
and everything else is just bullshit.

889
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:33,280
- Watch your mouth.
- That's the problem with you people.

890
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:34,920
You're never wrong, are you?

891
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,520
We're not wrong.

892
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:38,160
Since when did our country decide
it was our job

893
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:40,240
to just piss everybody else off?

894
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:44,000
You don't know
what the fuck you're talking about.

895
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,600
- Will.
- You should read a history book.

896
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:46,680
I will,

897
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:47,880
when you go read a newspaper!

898
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:50,160
I don't have to. I was there!

899
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:57,680
Let's go now.

900
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:01,840
No, you're walking.

901
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:03,440
- What?
- Fine!

902
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:30,280
Keisha. Where's Keisha?

903
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:32,640
Keisha.

904
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:35,480
- There you go.
- Thanks.

905
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:38,040
Keisha, I wanna talk to you
for just a minute.

906
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:39,360
Jamal, I'm working.

907
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:41,240
I know you're working.
I just need to talk to you for a minute.

908
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:43,920
- I promise I won't get upset.
- Leave me alone. Leave me alone.

909
01:00:58,120 --> 01:01:00,680
The handle broke off
the kitchen cabinet again.

910
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:02,760
Can you take a look at it after dinner?

911
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:03,960
Sure.

912
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:05,880
Where's Dede?

913
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:08,200
She's eating at Jenna's.

914
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:09,880
You don't know her.

915
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:11,640
Can you get this, honey?

916
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:19,680
Thank you.

917
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:23,080
You know if you cut the brake lines
on the car, I can't fix that.

918
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:24,760
What're you talking about?

919
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:29,800
I don't think it was good for you
defending Billy in there today.

920
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:32,400
Half the kids in that school can't read,

921
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:34,800
and they're worried about
what's written on some damn T-shirt.

922
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:36,480
I'm worried about our son.

923
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:38,200
Don't. He hates me.

924
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:40,560
He hates that you're in the military.

925
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,440
All 15-year-olds hate their parents.

926
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:46,960
I guarantee, if I was a pacifist
he'd be in Fallujah by now.

927
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:48,800
You're driving me crazy.

928
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:51,040
You need to stop breaking stuff
around the house.

929
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:52,880
- I know what you're doing.
- I'm trying to get through to you.

930
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,280
You're not helping me, Pen.

931
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:56,720
You're making me feel
like a mental patient.

932
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:59,400
- Now there's an idea.
- Very funny.

933
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:01,960
You smelled like a bar at Billy's school.

934
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:03,240
Do your patients know?

935
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:05,800
I am handling it.

936
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:09,680
- Now leave me alone.
- No, I will not leave you alone. I'm sorry.

937
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:12,440
Do you think you're the only one
who's had it rough?

938
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:14,600
I was the one
who got up every single morning

939
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:16,600
and went online
to check that casualty list.

940
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:18,480
And I was the one
who got sick to my stomach

941
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:20,680
every time I heard about
another roadside bomb.

942
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:22,800
And who do you think
told our daughter every night

943
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:25,280
that Daddy wasn't coming home
tomorrow or the next day,

944
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:27,440
or the day after that,
but that he still loved her

945
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:28,680
and me?

946
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:31,640
Now I understand you feel compelled
to serve and I supported that.

947
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:33,200
Hell, I left my job and got another one

948
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:36,360
just so one of us would be home
some of the time with our daughter!

949
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:39,080
And when you asked to extend
your deployment, I supported that, too.

950
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:42,200
Because I think what you did
was right and noble.

951
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:45,520
But I did not spend the last eight months
of my life in sheer hell

952
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:48,200
for you to come home and be an asshole!

953
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:08,000
This is the third time
I've been back and forth here.

954
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:10,800
I got a problem with my back, okay?
I don't get around good.

955
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:12,440
I'm going back and forth,

956
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:14,560
downtown, back here,
downtown, back here,

957
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:16,560
and I sit here
and come talk to you people.

958
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:18,200
And you sit here looking at me
like you don't understand

959
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:19,360
what the fuck I'm talking about!

960
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:20,480
Somebody here got to have information.

961
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:23,640
Don't tell me this is the first
damn discharge papers you've seen!

962
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:26,240
And you're sitting there like you don't
understand what the fuck I'm saying!

963
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:28,480
Somebody better tell me something
in this motherfucking...

964
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:33,080
Hey, Doc.

965
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:35,240
Hey, how you doing?

966
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:37,280
Hey, I'm good. I'm good. You?

967
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:38,880
I'm great.

968
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:40,400
Hey, you remember me?

969
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:42,280
You helped wash out my leg.

970
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:44,160
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

971
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:47,240
- Good to see you.
- Yeah. You okay?

972
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:48,640
Yeah, yeah.

973
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:50,120
I'm supposed to meet a patient here.

974
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:52,920
Actually, pick up a prescription
for a patient.

975
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:55,400
They don't really hand that shit out.

976
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:57,840
Yeah, well. It's more of a consult.
I can't really talk about it.

977
01:03:57,920 --> 01:03:59,080
Right, right.

978
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:01,120
There's some good people there.

979
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:04,080
I'm sure whoever needs a consult,
that'll really help.

980
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:06,160
Yeah.

981
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:09,120
- Good to see you.
- It was good seeing you, too.

982
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:04,520
Fight!

983
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:07,000
Hey, you!

984
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:08,160
Hey.

985
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:10,960
All right, enough.
Stop it. Break it up right, you two!

986
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:11,960
Right now! Stop it!

987
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:14,440
Hey! Hey! That's it! That's it!

988
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:16,960
Move! Move!

989
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:20,920
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

990
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,160
- Come on, let's go.
- I said I'm fine.

991
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:28,120
- Let's go back to class! Come on.
- Okay, it's over. Just go back to class.

992
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:29,200
Go.

993
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:18,120
- Damn it, Oliver!
- I'm sorry, Mommy.

994
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:23,800
I'm sorry. Come here. Come here.

995
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:25,240
Why are you crying?

996
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:28,760
Mommy just gets
a little bit sad sometimes.

997
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:31,000
- You mad at me?
- I didn't mean to yell.

998
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:32,880
But I love you.

999
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,880
I love you so much, baby.

1000
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:16,320
- Hello,
- Hi.

1001
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:17,560
Is Cary there, please?

1002
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:19,600
Yeah, this is Cary, Who's calling?

1003
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:22,400
Oh, hi. This is Vanessa Price.

1004
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:26,120
- I'm really sorry to be calling this late.
- No, No, it's all right,

1005
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:28,880
It's just... I could really use your help.

1006
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,400
Well, yes, sure, You wanna talk?

1007
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:34,160
Yeah.

1008
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:37,000
How about tomorrow before school?
We can grab some coffee or something,

1009
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:38,640
Great. Great, thank you.

1010
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:46,640
Hello.

1011
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:49,840
What?

1012
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:51,960
Where is he?

1013
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:53,680
All right.

1014
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,360
Been in there for about an hour.
Kept asking for you.

1015
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:10,960
You guys work together or something?

1016
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:12,960
Yeah. Yeah, we worked together.

1017
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:16,120
You don't have to go in there
if you don't want to.

1018
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:17,680
It's all right.

1019
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:33,680
Jamal!

1020
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:37,840
- What's up, man?
- I'm coming in, all right?

1021
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:58,240
What're you doing, man?

1022
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:02,440
I don't know, boss.
Just like the job, this wasn't working out.

1023
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:04,680
What job is that?

1024
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:06,880
The job at this dealership, man.
You know about that.

1025
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,600
Right. Right.

1026
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:15,600
She wouldn't see me.

1027
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:17,880
Who wouldn't see you?

1028
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,080
Keisha.

1029
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:21,520
She wouldn't see me,

1030
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:24,520
so I had to make her see me.
You know what I'm saying?

1031
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:25,680
Yeah.

1032
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:31,280
Thought she was one of them, Tommy.

1033
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:36,200
Like I turned and wasn't no time.

1034
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:39,040
They don't give you no time.

1035
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:41,440
Right.

1036
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:49,440
Jamal, what do you say
we go back to the center,

1037
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:53,080
and we'll talk to someone, get some help.

1038
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:55,160
- You come with me?
- Yeah.

1039
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:57,360
Yeah, I'm coming with you.

1040
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:00,360
First you gotta give me that gun.

1041
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:04,040
I like my gun.

1042
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:06,760
I know you like your gun.

1043
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:10,400
But come on, man,
you don't wanna do this.

1044
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:12,680
I'll come with you.

1045
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:20,880
Anything for you, Daydream.

1046
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:25,160
Oh, shit.

1047
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:27,280
Got movement.

1048
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:35,720
- Shit!
- Jamal!

1049
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:39,520
Jamal! God damn it!

1050
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:41,440
Jamal!

1051
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:47,600
Fuck!

1052
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:54,680
Damn it!

1053
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:58,560
Jamal.

1054
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:09,040
Go! Go! Go!

1055
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:22,280
Mike Falcone called me.

1056
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:26,320
He said you never showed up
for your appointment at the Academy.

1057
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:29,440
Yeah. I thought it was, like, a possible...

1058
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:31,160
He was holding a spot for you.

1059
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:33,240
- Jesus, Tommy!
- So maybe I'm not ready yet,

1060
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:34,600
even if you want me to be ready.

1061
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:37,120
What I want you to stop watching
Band of Brothers, smoking dope

1062
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:40,040
- and playing video games all day!
- Fine. Maybe I should just re-enlist, huh?

1063
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:42,800
Maybe that's all I'm really fucking good at
is fucking killing people!

1064
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:45,320
- Stop feeling sorry for yourself.
- Fuck you!

1065
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:47,280
You don't know
what it's fucking like over there!

1066
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:48,840
You don't know
what the fuck I went through!

1067
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:51,000
Fuck you! Stay the fuck away from me.

1068
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:53,240
- Damn!
- Stop!

1069
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:07,000
- It's okay.
- I couldn't get to him...

1070
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:10,640
It's okay. Don't. Don't.

1071
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:13,240
It's okay.

1072
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:16,560
I couldn't save... Couldn't save him.

1073
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:22,040
It's okay. It's okay, Tommy.
It's all right, Tommy.

1074
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:28,920
- You all right, Dede?
- We're gonna wait for your father.

1075
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:17,080
What the hell?

1076
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:19,400
Can't work on a holiday.

1077
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:33,800
Think I ate too much.

1078
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:37,720
Penelope, hello.
Come on, come on, come on.

1079
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:39,440
Will, where have you been?

1080
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:44,000
Look, this is Hector,
Rodrigo and... I forget.

1081
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:47,000
But they were working on Thanksgiving

1082
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:48,840
so I invited them to our house for dinner.

1083
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:50,760
Baby, we have guests. My father...

1084
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:52,760
- Carl, hey!
- Will.

1085
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:54,640
- How're you doing, man?
- Baby, go lie down.

1086
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:57,360
No, no, no. It's Thanksgiving.
You don't lay down on Thanksgiving.

1087
01:14:57,440 --> 01:14:59,800
Come on, come on, guys.
Come on, let's eat.

1088
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:02,200
Hey, everybody. Happy Thanksgiving.

1089
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:03,920
You know what?

1090
01:15:04,520 --> 01:15:06,440
Since it's Thanksgiving,
I think I should say a few words.

1091
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:07,760
Don't worry. Hold on, hold on.

1092
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:11,440
I know, you're all thinking,

1093
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:14,560
"Is he gonna do
or say something crazy? What?

1094
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:18,200
"The drunk, violent fool

1095
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:20,480
"back from a year in the desert."

1096
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:22,600
Yeah, but don't worry. Don't worry.

1097
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:25,320
I'm not going to do anything like that.

1098
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:27,120
I know I get drunk,

1099
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:30,800
and I get angry
and it can get to be a bit much.

1100
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:33,640
But that's how I'm dealing with it.

1101
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:37,880
If that impacts on your life in a bad way,
then I'm sorry.

1102
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:40,480
And I'm gonna make it right. I promise.

1103
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:42,800
But we're not gonna talk about that.

1104
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:45,760
Let's talk about what we're thankful for.

1105
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:48,120
And I'm thankful for my family

1106
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:51,760
and my friends. And my new friends.

1107
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:53,760
And I'm also thankful

1108
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:56,560
that I live in a country

1109
01:15:56,720 --> 01:16:01,680
where I can eat till I'm full
three times a day, seven days a week.

1110
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:05,040
And I'm thankful for

1111
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:07,400
two-ration beef with mushroom sauce,

1112
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:10,480
and heat and dust and roadblocks

1113
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:12,840
and Haji Pepsi,

1114
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:15,240
and kids who run up and hug you,

1115
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:17,680
and kids who spit at you,

1116
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:21,320
and mothers having babies faster
so they can grow up to kill you.

1117
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:24,800
And the boys,

1118
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:29,720
who are young and brave and scared,

1119
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,480
and the Kevlar

1120
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:37,800
propped against upside-down M-16s
with boots next to them,

1121
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:44,040
Boys with wives and fiances and babies

1122
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:45,840
and mothers and fathers.

1123
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:49,360
Boys who just wanna come home.

1124
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:53,960
And they do come home,

1125
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:57,640
maimed and haunted and fucked up,

1126
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:00,760
if they come home at all.

1127
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:07,000
But, hey, hey, it's Thanksgiving.

1128
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:08,920
Let's eat, enjoy ourselves.

1129
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:11,000
- Carl, you saved me that drumstick?
- Of course, Will.

1130
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:14,760
All right. Come on, come on, guys.
Let's get something to eat now. Come on.

1131
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:20,320
Grab some of these good comidas,
Mi casa es su casa,

1132
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:23,720
Come on. This is great.
Thanksgiving. All right.

1133
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:26,560
Hey, what is that? What the fuck is that?

1134
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:28,800
- Dad, what're you doing?
- What is that!

1135
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:34,240
Back off me!

1136
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:38,680
- Get over here, boy.
- I'm... I'm...

1137
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:40,840
- Get away from me!
- What's with you?

1138
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:44,360
It's okay, baby.

1139
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:46,640
- He pulled it out.
- My God.

1140
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:55,000
Will.

1141
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:00,800
Put it down.

1142
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:05,280
We'll get you help.

1143
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:07,600
Think about me and Dede.

1144
01:19:39,680 --> 01:19:41,520
We all grew up together,

1145
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:44,760
Me and Jordan,
we lived on the same block,

1146
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:48,520
He and I used to play football, basketball,

1147
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:51,360
Anyway...

1148
01:19:58,520 --> 01:20:00,000
He died in Al Hayy.

1149
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:04,000
We just got word we were coming home.

1150
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:08,640
We were all pretty excited, you know?
Yeah.

1151
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,720
He was my buddy, you know?

1152
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:19,760
And I didn't get to him in time,

1153
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:23,560
And when,

1154
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,680
when I was holding him,

1155
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:30,280
when I was holding him,

1156
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:35,520
it wasn't like I saw his eyes close
or you know, anything like that.

1157
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:42,120
I just felt this... Just felt this vibration

1158
01:20:44,160 --> 01:20:45,680
and he was gone.

1159
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:48,360
And now,

1160
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:52,120
now I've been back for, you know,

1161
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:54,360
some time now,
trying to make sense of all the shit.

1162
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,680
What I do know is,

1163
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:07,160
I don't belong here anymore.

1164
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:13,000
Shit.

1165
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:20,560
Right here, Rudy. Over the top.

1166
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:23,080
We don't have to talk
about the war today,

1167
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:24,640
We've made some good progress,

1168
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:26,520
Even coming in here was a good first step,

1169
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:31,320
It's not like they gave me a choice, Doctor.

1170
01:21:32,440 --> 01:21:33,840
No, it's okay.

1171
01:21:34,760 --> 01:21:36,440
I wanna tell it, actually.

1172
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:44,000
I'd been in Balad about a month.

1173
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:49,040
Was 130 degrees, sand was in everything.

1174
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:51,160
It was awful.

1175
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:55,600
We heard mortars all the time,

1176
01:21:55,680 --> 01:21:58,200
but we never got anything serious.

1177
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:02,200
I'd just finished a 12-hour shift.

1178
01:22:02,680 --> 01:22:05,760
I was exhausted, ready to go to sleep.

1179
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:08,480
When all hell broke loose.

1180
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:19,160
Look alive, people!

1181
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:21,840
Heads up! Let's hit it! Let's go!

1182
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:31,160
Incoming CASEVAC! MASSCAL situation!
What's your name, son?

1183
01:22:31,240 --> 01:22:33,320
Pulse 120. Let's get a tie-off here.

1184
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:35,880
I need two units of plasma
to this soldier right away!

1185
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:37,520
How you doing, soldier?

1186
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:41,880
Pulse rapid and thready!
Let's get some QuickCIot over here now!

1187
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:44,280
Hold your head up, son.

1188
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:46,720
Come on, help me! I'm hit!
Radio for help!

1189
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:51,200
Okay, you'll be okay.
Go outside. Go outside. Go.

1190
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:53,240
You guys, you can't be in here.

1191
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:55,120
I need that blood back here now!

1192
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:56,400
Medevac's on its way from Taji.

1193
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:57,680
- ETA?
- One minute.

1194
01:22:57,800 --> 01:22:59,880
- Somebody alert the chaplain.
- Okay.

1195
01:22:59,960 --> 01:23:01,160
- Please get off me!
- All right.

1196
01:23:01,240 --> 01:23:02,280
I need you guys to wait outside.

1197
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:04,040
No, no, no! We're not fucking waiting!

1198
01:23:04,120 --> 01:23:06,960
You all got to fix him.
Do something. Fix him, Doc!

1199
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:10,080
I will do that, but I need you to go outside.

1200
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:12,320
- Motherfucker, you fix him...
- Just calm down.

1201
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:14,080
What are you doing?

1202
01:23:18,440 --> 01:23:21,400
- Blood pressure's dropping.
- I need that QuickCIot now!

1203
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:23,640
Starting chest compressions. Go!

1204
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:45,840
Elevate. Elevate. Put his legs up.

1205
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:52,200
I amputated six arms and legs
in three hours.

1206
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:55,760
Four soldiers died on the table,

1207
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:57,680
all under the age of 20.

1208
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:03,240
I mean, I saw all that...

1209
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:06,080
And I'll always have that.

1210
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:09,920
But there's that...

1211
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:14,840
that moment when you realize
you can't help someone,

1212
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:18,480
and you feel heartbreak.

1213
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:22,960
And then the shame

1214
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:26,840
because you couldn't do your job.

1215
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:32,560
It was an unusual situation.

1216
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:34,400
A crisis.

1217
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:36,640
During war...

1218
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:39,240
Doctor, I know all that,
but it's not about that.

1219
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:40,880
It's...

1220
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,720
I don't feel anything.

1221
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:51,560
I'm supposed to feel something, right?

1222
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:55,080
When you treat a patient
you're supposed to feel something.

1223
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:00,840
Well, I don't feel anything.

1224
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:07,040
I didn't even know their names.

1225
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:43,720
You know, I was kind of surprised
you called me, actually.

1226
01:25:44,240 --> 01:25:46,600
After what you were like that first day...

1227
01:25:47,240 --> 01:25:48,920
- Really?
- You don't remember this?

1228
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:52,520
You don't remember this? That first day
when I'm helping you out at the car.

1229
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:55,880
You were like, "I'm fine. I'm fine.
Leave me alone."

1230
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:58,920
- I kind of remember that. Yeah.
- You remember that?

1231
01:25:59,720 --> 01:26:00,680
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

1232
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:02,120
I'm just giving you a hard time.

1233
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:04,240
I know, but that's really
kind of inexcusable.

1234
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:05,320
No.

1235
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:08,040
I just have a really hard time
trusting people.

1236
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:12,360
- You haven't been seeing anybody?
- You mean like a shrink?

1237
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:16,720
No, no. I meant, have you had
a boyfriend since you got back?

1238
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:18,680
No.

1239
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:24,120
I was seeing somebody before I left,
but that just didn't work out.

1240
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:30,320
What happened to your hand?

1241
01:26:41,720 --> 01:26:43,920
We were in this city, in Al Hayy,

1242
01:26:44,680 --> 01:26:47,480
and I was part of a convoy of trucks.

1243
01:26:47,560 --> 01:26:50,720
We were driving into the city.

1244
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:53,760
It was hot as hell,

1245
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:56,680
and dusty and horrible and...

1246
01:26:58,600 --> 01:27:01,680
Just driving into the center of the city

1247
01:27:02,240 --> 01:27:06,600
and something started to go really weird.
And the truck in front of us...

1248
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:09,600
The trucks in front of us,
they got ambushed.

1249
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:12,160
So the rest of us,

1250
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:18,400
we took another road

1251
01:27:18,520 --> 01:27:21,720
to try to get back around to the main road
that we were on.

1252
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:26,120
And I saw this little kid,

1253
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:30,400
with a Tootsie Pop or something.
I don't know what he had.

1254
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:32,400
I just remember this kid.

1255
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:38,040
And we turned this corner
and we just drove and...

1256
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:42,160
Explosion.

1257
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:44,400
Just a big explosion.

1258
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:47,360
And it was a...

1259
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:51,480
It was just a bomb on the road,
on the side of the road.

1260
01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:57,280
I don't remember anything.

1261
01:28:00,120 --> 01:28:01,800
Just that I was told I was...

1262
01:28:03,160 --> 01:28:04,680
I was very lucky.

1263
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:19,680
I have a confession to make.

1264
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:24,280
I wasn't helping you that day
because of your hand.

1265
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:29,400
It's 'cause I thought you were...

1266
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:33,600
'Cause I thought you were so beautiful.

1267
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:38,360
- Beautiful?
- Mmm.

1268
01:28:40,360 --> 01:28:41,400
What?

1269
01:28:41,880 --> 01:28:42,880
What.

1270
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:45,840
I don't know. Beautiful?

1271
01:28:46,640 --> 01:28:48,640
And divorced at 24

1272
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:51,440
and one kid and one hand.

1273
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:53,440
Especially with one kid and one hand.

1274
01:28:55,480 --> 01:28:56,440
Hey.

1275
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:23,360
- Hi.
- Hi.

1276
01:29:28,680 --> 01:29:30,080
You all right?

1277
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:34,680
Let's just take it slow, okay?

1278
01:29:35,320 --> 01:29:36,280
Yeah.

1279
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:05,920
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay. It's all right.

1280
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:13,640
Hold on.

1281
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:15,040
All right.

1282
01:30:16,120 --> 01:30:17,880
- Do you wanna get that?
- I'll get that.

1283
01:30:18,520 --> 01:30:19,920
I'll get this.

1284
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:28,520
- All right, now what?
- Just that...

1285
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:30,960
- Just pull that.
- It's stuck. I'm trying to pull it.

1286
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:32,800
It's definitely stuck.

1287
01:30:34,360 --> 01:30:35,640
How do you do this?

1288
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:38,400
I don't know, I've never done this before.

1289
01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:42,520
Fuck it.

1290
01:30:46,640 --> 01:30:48,200
Stop laughing.

1291
01:30:52,840 --> 01:30:54,320
This is serious.

1292
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:13,040
I was thinking maybe we could talk.

1293
01:31:16,160 --> 01:31:17,280
Okay.

1294
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,800
I'll talk and you can just listen.

1295
01:31:24,280 --> 01:31:26,280
I'm sorry about what I did.

1296
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:28,120
I was wrong.

1297
01:31:29,680 --> 01:31:32,960
I've got some issues.

1298
01:31:33,560 --> 01:31:35,640
And I'm getting some help with that.

1299
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:38,600
In fact, your mom and I are
seeing someone

1300
01:31:38,680 --> 01:31:41,120
and we think that
at some point down the road

1301
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:44,760
it'd be good if you went with us
maybe once or twice.

1302
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:46,520
Dede, too.

1303
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:51,440
But you can make up your mind
about that when the time comes.

1304
01:31:57,960 --> 01:32:00,080
I know you're against the war.

1305
01:32:00,720 --> 01:32:02,320
And I can respect that.

1306
01:32:04,200 --> 01:32:08,760
But are you against the war in principle
or because I was part of it?

1307
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:15,360
Both.

1308
01:32:39,280 --> 01:32:41,840
- Well, I talked to him.
- Good.

1309
01:32:44,680 --> 01:32:48,200
- So what you doing?
- Paying bills. Nothing important.

1310
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:56,560
I love you.

1311
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:04,480
I love you, too.

1312
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:08,960
Can you look at me when you say that?

1313
01:33:18,640 --> 01:33:19,880
I love you.

1314
01:33:21,680 --> 01:33:23,640
I love you very, very much.

1315
01:33:26,840 --> 01:33:28,040
Thank you.

1316
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:24,440
Bye.

1317
01:34:34,760 --> 01:34:36,400
Dear Mom and Dad,

1318
01:34:37,120 --> 01:34:39,880
I know you don't understand
why I re-enlisted,

1319
01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:43,320
It's confusing and scary for all of us,

1320
01:34:43,400 --> 01:34:44,720
I know that,

1321
01:34:45,240 --> 01:34:47,000
But I have to go back,

1322
01:34:47,200 --> 01:34:50,440
I don't wanna die
and Jordan didn't wanna die, either,

1323
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:52,120
And maybe when we went over there
the first time

1324
01:34:52,200 --> 01:34:54,480
we didn't know
what we were getting into,

1325
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:58,200
Maybe the leaders of our country didn't
know what they were getting into,

1326
01:34:58,280 --> 01:34:59,640
Maybe the people don't want us there,

1327
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:02,280
Maybe this whole thing
is just making it worse,

1328
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:05,120
But even after all that,

1329
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:07,080
I can't stay behind
knowing there are soldiers over there

1330
01:35:07,200 --> 01:35:09,600
getting attacked every day
and dying every day,

1331
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:12,360
I don't feel like it's wrong of me

1332
01:35:12,480 --> 01:35:15,040
for wanting to go back over there
and help them,

1333
01:35:20,720 --> 01:35:22,400
It's a hard job being a soldier,

1334
01:35:22,480 --> 01:35:25,760
Not just for people like me,
but for the people we leave behind,

1335
01:35:25,960 --> 01:35:30,160
The both of you, girlfriends,
kids, husbands and wives,

1336
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:32,520
We all carry scars of war,

1337
01:35:32,680 --> 01:35:35,560
But I know that if I do my part
then maybe we'll all get out of there

1338
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:38,040
and get home to the people
who love us just a little bit quicker,

1339
01:35:38,120 --> 01:35:39,800
- This is my wife, Penelope.
- Hello.

1340
01:35:39,880 --> 01:35:41,120
- Daughter, Dede...
- Hello.

1341
01:35:41,200 --> 01:35:43,360
...and that's Billy.
- Nice to meet you.

1342
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:46,560
- How you doing? Great game today.
- Thank you.

1343
01:35:47,080 --> 01:35:49,440
We're going to get something to eat now.

1344
01:35:49,560 --> 01:35:51,520
- You guys wanna go?
- Sounds good.

1345
01:35:51,680 --> 01:35:53,680
I hope this can
make sense to you,

1346
01:35:54,160 --> 01:35:56,320
Because it makes perfect sense to me,

1347
01:35:57,320 --> 01:35:59,720
These are my guys and I need them

1348
01:36:00,240 --> 01:36:02,320
just as much as they need me,

1349
01:36:07,560 --> 01:36:10,080
I'm not trying to be noble or brave,

1350
01:36:10,760 --> 01:36:13,560
But I feel, if I don't go
then I'd fail Jordan, Jamal,

1351
01:36:13,640 --> 01:36:16,800
and all those who went over with me
and sacrificed so much,

1352
01:36:17,200 --> 01:36:19,880
And that'd be worse
than never coming home at all,

1353
01:36:20,760 --> 01:36:22,720
I know you aren't happy with this,

1354
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:24,840
but I also know that you love me,

1355
01:36:25,240 --> 01:36:26,640
I'm going back,

1356
01:36:27,080 --> 01:36:29,760
And I'm going back to do
the best job I know how,

1357
01:36:30,080 --> 01:36:32,240
And get back to you as soon as I can,

1358
01:36:34,320 --> 01:36:35,640
Pray for me,
