00:00:00,441 --> 00:00:01,965
Well, when a fellow
needs a diamond,

2
00:00:02,043 --> 00:00:05,535
what better place to get one
than the Tower of London?

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:08,414
The rest is all
a bit hazy, but

4
00:00:08,483 --> 00:00:11,247
there appears to have been an
altercation with the yeoman of the guard.

5
00:00:11,319 --> 00:00:13,048
You didn't.

6
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:16,216
Thirty days
bread and water.

7
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,823
But you know what?

8
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:23,329
Prison certainly
clears the head.

9
00:00:23,731 --> 00:00:26,461
Pure and simple,
I want you to marry me.

10
00:00:27,802 --> 00:00:30,737
And it's a one-word
conversation, Delysia.

11
00:00:35,643 --> 00:00:40,103
Don't you think that on
such a momentous occasion

12
00:00:40,181 --> 00:00:41,671
a little time
should be allowed?

13
00:00:41,749 --> 00:00:43,512
Oh, stalling tactic.

14
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,536
Is it because I'm not
rich enough for her?

15
00:00:46,537 --> 00:00:47,085
Certainly not.

16
00:00:47,155 --> 00:00:50,386
Well, it's true. I'm wearing
most of my worldly possessions.

17
00:00:50,458 --> 00:00:53,385
I could never offer
this kind of blackmail.

18
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:53,518
Oh.

19
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:55,756
And who pays you
for playing the piano, huh?

20
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,957
You telling me you give Nick
his money back after every show?

21
00:00:58,032 --> 00:01:01,365
No! And every damned shilling
I take hurts me to the bone.

22
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:04,462
Which is why it's got
to change, Delysia.

23
00:01:04,539 --> 00:01:08,031
Money or love? That's the
question I'm asking, D.

24
00:01:08,876 --> 00:01:13,438
With you singing and me playing,
we could knock the world flat.

25
00:01:16,584 --> 00:01:18,313
Yes or no, Delysia?

26
00:01:20,154 --> 00:01:24,022
You are a most uncommonly
persuasive man, Mr. Pardew.

27
00:01:26,828 --> 00:01:28,591
But surely a lady
should have a moment or two

28
00:01:28,663 --> 00:01:31,188
to consider the most
important decision of her life?

29
00:01:31,266 --> 00:01:32,893
A moment?
She's had a whole year.

30
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:34,195
You did say you
were in my debt.

31
00:01:36,271 --> 00:01:38,796
Damn it, I did, too.
Fair enough.

32
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:42,840
Okay, here's the deal.

33
00:01:43,177 --> 00:01:45,839
I'll play for you today,
Delysia,

34
00:01:45,913 --> 00:01:49,110
and for the rest of your
life, if you'll marry me.

35
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:51,975
Never again
if you don't.

36
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:59,149
See you later, Miss Pettigrew.
-Later?

37
00:01:59,227 --> 00:02:01,593
In my professional
capacity.

38
00:02:05,533 --> 00:02:07,000
As for you,

39
00:02:07,535 --> 00:02:09,059
it's now or never.

40
00:02:09,137 --> 00:02:11,469
The ship sails
tomorrow morning.

41
00:02:14,275 --> 00:02:15,572
He is...

42
00:02:16,544 --> 00:02:18,569
Impossible.
-Magnificent.

43
00:02:21,249 --> 00:02:23,012
So you marry him.

44
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:34,760
Guinevere?
-Mmm-hmm?

45
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:39,057
Tell me the honest truth.
It's a darned fix, isn't it?

46
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:43,830
Nothing that can't be unfixed
with some good common sense.

47
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:46,304
But take a look
at the headlines.

48
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:50,242
With Nick, I get this magnificent
flat and my job at the Peacock.

49
00:02:50,845 --> 00:02:52,107
And with Phil,

50
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:55,911
I get the best part on the West End
stage and my chance to be a star.

51
00:02:55,983 --> 00:02:57,678
And with Michael?

52
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,547
With Michael...

53
00:03:01,656 --> 00:03:03,817
I get the best friend
I ever had.

54
00:03:03,891 --> 00:03:05,825
Is that all Michael is?

55
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,457
Well,

56
00:03:10,665 --> 00:03:12,792
he's rather passionate, too.

57
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:22,235
I know what
you're thinking.

58
00:03:22,944 --> 00:03:24,775
Michael's the one.

59
00:03:29,884 --> 00:03:31,647
But what about
everything else?

60
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:33,516
And who says I'm looking
for a darned husband

61
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,021
this very minute, anyway?

62
00:03:36,357 --> 00:03:39,622
Not everything comes along
just when we want it.

63
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:44,559
There are times when
choices just have to be made,

64
00:03:44,632 --> 00:03:46,998
or you certainly
will miss out.

65
00:03:47,335 --> 00:03:48,597
No.

66
00:03:49,003 --> 00:03:51,494
No, I won't accept that.
I won't.

67
00:03:51,572 --> 00:03:55,702
<i>This " all of you or none of
you" stuff that Michael's pulling.</i>

68
00:03:56,811 --> 00:03:58,438
It's too much.

69
00:03:58,513 --> 00:04:00,572
But he is in love
with you, Delysia.

70
00:04:00,648 --> 00:04:03,139
Can you say that
about anyone else?

71
00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:06,452
Guinevere,

72
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:11,054
haven't you ever been torn between
more than one person at the same time?

73
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:15,255
No, I can't say I've had
that particular problem.

74
00:04:18,499 --> 00:04:20,262
You are beautiful, Delysia.

75
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:25,664
Well, it's not a bad figure,
if I do say so myself.

76
00:04:29,444 --> 00:04:32,379
Have you ever been
in love at all, Guinevere?

77
00:04:33,781 --> 00:04:35,715
Once.
-And was it this

78
00:04:36,184 --> 00:04:38,243
<i>" all of you
or none of you" stuff?</i>

79
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,547
Oh, yes.

80
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,520
From him or from you?

81
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:43,347
Both.

82
00:04:43,424 --> 00:04:45,654
Really? Do tell.

83
00:04:47,128 --> 00:04:48,288
No.

84
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,764
All a long time ago.

85
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:53,665
You'll catch your death.
Put this on.

86
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:01,941
Allow me.

87
00:05:06,647 --> 00:05:08,308
Excuse me, madam.

88
00:05:10,718 --> 00:05:12,242
Excuse me.

89
00:05:15,022 --> 00:05:16,387
Excuse me?

90
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:19,386
Take that through
to the kitchen, please.

91
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:22,554
And you do the same as well.
And tell John to pull the rug up.

92
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,860
Party about to start
soon, so chop-chop.

93
00:05:24,932 --> 00:05:27,025
Party? There's a party?

94
00:05:28,402 --> 00:05:29,994
Miss Lafosse?
-Hmm?

95
00:05:30,071 --> 00:05:33,063
There's a troop of people downstairs who
appear to be under the misapprehension

96
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,801
there is to be
a party here.

97
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,104
Yes.

98
00:05:36,177 --> 00:05:37,337
Today?

99
00:05:38,012 --> 00:05:40,071
Yes. Didn't I say?
-No.

100
00:05:40,181 --> 00:05:41,170
Oh.

101
00:05:41,649 --> 00:05:42,980
Silly me.

102
00:05:43,985 --> 00:05:46,078
Will there be many people?

103
00:05:46,153 --> 00:05:48,087
I should say so,
Guinevere.

104
00:05:48,155 --> 00:05:49,247
It's the big one.

105
00:05:49,323 --> 00:05:51,154
<i>The big one?
-Pile on the Pepper.</i>

106
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:53,489
Phil's going to make
the announcement.

107
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:54,721
What do you think?

108
00:05:54,795 --> 00:05:56,854
Do I get the part? Hmm?

109
00:05:57,465 --> 00:05:58,727
Oh, yes.

110
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,287
My dear, you look as if you've never
been to a cocktail party in your life.

111
00:06:22,356 --> 00:06:24,017
Why, thank you,
but I don't drink.

112
00:06:24,091 --> 00:06:26,787
Oh, it's not a drink,
really. It's a cocktail.

113
00:06:26,861 --> 00:06:28,624
Good luck, darlings.

114
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:31,428
Joe's the old one
over there.

115
00:06:34,969 --> 00:06:36,664
Work your magic.

116
00:06:51,018 --> 00:06:52,952
Of all the nerve.

117
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:56,114
Well. Time to make
the Rabbit run.

118
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,748
Are you sure
that's wise?

119
00:06:57,825 --> 00:06:58,917
Mmm.

120
00:07:00,061 --> 00:07:01,460
Phil, darling.

121
00:07:01,529 --> 00:07:04,726
Delysia, sweetheart.
Lovely to see you.

122
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:07,267
This is Charlotte Warren.

123
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,771
Do you know
each other?

124
00:07:10,838 --> 00:07:12,169
A pleasure.

125
00:07:12,239 --> 00:07:14,036
How nice
to see you again.

126
00:07:14,108 --> 00:07:17,544
Phil and I had such a lovely lunch
together today, didn't we, darling?

127
00:07:17,612 --> 00:07:20,376
Well, I thought he'd have a
big appetite, after last night.

128
00:07:20,448 --> 00:07:22,473
May I suggest retiring
to a safe distance?

129
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:24,381
I think you're
absolutely right.

130
00:07:24,452 --> 00:07:25,919
Tin hat on.

131
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:31,380
I'm sorry,
it's Phil Goldman.

132
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:33,017
How do you do?
-We've met before, actually.

133
00:07:33,094 --> 00:07:35,289
You were entirely
naked at the time.

134
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:37,363
Guinevere?

135
00:07:37,431 --> 00:07:39,456
Is that you?
My goodness!

136
00:07:39,767 --> 00:07:40,859
You look marvelous.

137
00:07:40,935 --> 00:07:44,268
Charlotte, I just wanted to let
you know there are no hard feelings.

138
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:46,533
That is so
gracious of you.

139
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:50,239
To the victor the spoils, to the
vanquished two comps for Press Night.

140
00:07:50,311 --> 00:07:51,778
And so wise.

141
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:54,314
I hope I can be
like that one day.

142
00:07:55,082 --> 00:07:57,812
Wisdom requires more than
the passing of years, I fear.

143
00:07:57,885 --> 00:08:01,446
Though a little bird tells me that the
part of the crippled mother is still open.

144
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:03,956
You'd look ravishing
with a stick.

145
00:08:07,128 --> 00:08:12,031
And I won't forget about those
tickets. Is it two, three, four...

146
00:08:12,099 --> 00:08:15,694
Silly me, I've forgotten how
many boyfriends you've got.

147
00:08:19,173 --> 00:08:20,333
Now, Philip,

148
00:08:20,408 --> 00:08:23,172
<i>how are your deliberations over
Pile on the Pepper proceeding?</i>

149
00:08:23,244 --> 00:08:25,269
Well, between
you and me,

150
00:08:25,646 --> 00:08:27,739
Charlotte has the most
alluring singing voice.

151
00:08:27,815 --> 00:08:31,683
And I have to say, Daddy's quite
keen. In fact, more than keen.

152
00:08:31,752 --> 00:08:34,482
So you're going to give
Miss Warren the part?

153
00:08:34,588 --> 00:08:38,547
Delysia's going to be a bit
off-color about it all, I'm afraid.

154
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:43,860
Hey ho.
-Just one question.

155
00:08:44,665 --> 00:08:48,226
Does Charlotte have quite the
same attachment to you as Delysia?

156
00:08:48,302 --> 00:08:51,100
No. No, no,
she certainly doesn't.

157
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:54,803
Do you think that was more
than a passing attraction?

158
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:57,469
I mean, we both
know actresses, Guinevere.

159
00:08:57,545 --> 00:09:00,446
It did occur to me
that it might be, you know,

160
00:09:00,514 --> 00:09:02,539
purely to secure the part?

161
00:09:02,883 --> 00:09:06,842
I have no doubt that Miss Lafosse
believes that you are one of the most...

162
00:09:08,956 --> 00:09:12,187
Unquestionably, the most
important man in that room.

163
00:09:12,259 --> 00:09:14,659
My dear woman,
do you really think so?

164
00:09:14,729 --> 00:09:15,855
I do.

165
00:09:16,464 --> 00:09:19,126
The scales have fallen
from my doubting eyes.

166
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,065
So pleased to have helped.
-Helped?

167
00:09:21,135 --> 00:09:24,366
You've just made me
the happiest man in the world.

168
00:09:25,506 --> 00:09:27,440
You seem to have made
quite an impression on him.

169
00:09:27,508 --> 00:09:30,443
Oh. Yes.
I do, don't I?

170
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:33,410
Joe Blomfield.

171
00:09:34,915 --> 00:09:36,576
A great pleasure.

172
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:40,211
Have we met before? I feel sure
I recognize you from somewhere.

173
00:09:40,287 --> 00:09:41,914
I don't think so,

174
00:09:41,989 --> 00:09:44,924
but I'm delighted
to make your acquaintance.

175
00:09:51,165 --> 00:09:53,725
I have met your fiancée,
I believe.

176
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:55,696
Edythe? Um...

177
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,734
No longer my fiancée,
I'm afraid.

178
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:02,173
Really? I'm so sorry.
Not a permanent rift, I hope?

179
00:10:02,943 --> 00:10:05,776
It would be ungentlemanly
of me to go into the details.

180
00:10:05,846 --> 00:10:07,245
Of course.

181
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:13,078
You know, these things
are amazing, aren't they?

182
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:14,314
May I?

183
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,714
Why not?
-Excuse me.

184
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:23,927
Progress?

185
00:10:24,265 --> 00:10:25,823
I'm afraid not.

186
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,395
Nor is there likely to be.

187
00:10:27,468 --> 00:10:30,164
Transformations work
both ways, Guinevere.

188
00:10:30,237 --> 00:10:34,571
It would take me 30 seconds to put
you back in the soup kitchen queue.

189
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:38,440
I told you,
I never forget a face.

190
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:40,139
Victoria Station.

191
00:10:40,614 --> 00:10:44,345
Nor have I forgotten with whom
you shared a taxi last night.

192
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,487
Oh, you have.

193
00:10:47,555 --> 00:10:50,581
If you want to continue
working for Delysia, you have.

194
00:10:50,658 --> 00:10:54,116
Now we all of us need things in
our life. I need Joe for his...

195
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:57,653
Well, he's a man of
connections. And you need...

196
00:10:59,066 --> 00:11:02,229
You need to stay off of
the streets, I imagine.

197
00:11:11,111 --> 00:11:14,103
I see Edythe
has told you all.

198
00:11:15,683 --> 00:11:20,279
If it weren't to commit another
indiscretion, I might disclose Edythe is...

199
00:11:22,623 --> 00:11:25,524
As Miss Lafosse would say,
crazy about you.

200
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,191
To be indiscreet back,

201
00:11:28,262 --> 00:11:33,097
she's rather more crazy about my position
in the fashion world than she is about me.

202
00:11:33,167 --> 00:11:35,931
A woman scorned
is a dangerous thing.

203
00:11:36,003 --> 00:11:39,063
And a bruised heart will often
speak harshly, Mr. Blomfield.

204
00:11:39,139 --> 00:11:43,075
Oh, I sometimes wonder where
Edythe's heart has got to.

205
00:11:43,878 --> 00:11:47,473
A woman with an absent heart
would not shed such tears, I think.

206
00:11:47,548 --> 00:11:48,742
Edythe?

207
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:51,407
Shed tears?

208
00:11:52,953 --> 00:11:54,477
You people!

209
00:11:55,222 --> 00:11:59,921
With your green drinks and your
parties and your subterfuges.

210
00:12:00,628 --> 00:12:02,926
You're all playing at love.

211
00:12:02,997 --> 00:12:05,830
One minute her, the next minute
someone else. Flit, flit, flit.

212
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,834
Well, I'm not playing.

213
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,999
Love is not a game.

214
00:12:31,492 --> 00:12:33,016
You've worked
your magic again.

215
00:12:33,093 --> 00:12:35,118
I can't do it.
-You've already done it.

216
00:12:35,195 --> 00:12:36,492
Joe just came up
and asked me

217
00:12:36,563 --> 00:12:38,656
if he was being a cad
breaking off the engagement.

218
00:12:38,732 --> 00:12:42,293
I've no idea what you said,
but I believe we've got him.

219
00:12:43,437 --> 00:12:45,302
It must be extraordinary
being you.

220
00:12:45,372 --> 00:12:48,341
Extraordinary? No.
Very, very ordinary.

221
00:12:48,409 --> 00:12:51,503
Delysia, darling, is it
true what Guinevere said?

222
00:12:51,578 --> 00:12:53,705
Well, if Miss P said it,
you can bet your shirt on it.

223
00:12:53,781 --> 00:12:56,181
So I can tell the whole
world about you and me?

224
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,275
Officially an item, what?
Till death us do part?

225
00:12:58,352 --> 00:12:59,614
What?

226
00:13:01,188 --> 00:13:05,750
At the very same time that you
announce your casting decision, sweets.

227
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:06,815
Oh!

228
00:13:07,194 --> 00:13:09,788
And what better time
than right now?

229
00:13:09,863 --> 00:13:12,457
You're absolutely right,
damn it. This very minute.

230
00:13:12,533 --> 00:13:15,764
Come on, gorgeous, no
time to waste. To horse.

231
00:13:20,808 --> 00:13:24,073
Well, I suppose
that was necessary.

232
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:28,679
You wanted the part. He'd
already chosen the Rabbit.

233
00:13:31,552 --> 00:13:34,953
No, Delysia,
you mustn't do this.

234
00:13:37,758 --> 00:13:39,157
But I must.

235
00:13:47,801 --> 00:13:49,769
Ladies and gentlemen,

236
00:13:53,007 --> 00:13:54,406
as you might know,

237
00:13:54,475 --> 00:13:58,241
<i>I'm putting on Pile on the Pepper
at the Ambassador, don't you know?</i>

238
00:13:58,312 --> 00:13:59,574
Have I mentioned this?

239
00:14:01,181 --> 00:14:05,140
Anyway, it is my pleasure to
announce that I have, today,

240
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:07,449
cast the lead
actress, what?

241
00:14:09,556 --> 00:14:12,923
<i>She is not only Hortensia
in Pile on the Pepper,</i>

242
00:14:12,993 --> 00:14:17,589
she is also my Hortensia,
if you know what I mean.

243
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,666
Ladies and gentlemen,

244
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:23,259
your Hortensia
and my Hortensia,

245
00:14:24,471 --> 00:14:26,302
Delysia Lafosse!

246
00:14:45,993 --> 00:14:47,187
So

247
00:14:47,728 --> 00:14:49,161
let's dance!

248
00:15:08,182 --> 00:15:09,410
Michael?

249
00:15:20,727 --> 00:15:22,627
May I?
-Please.

250
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:09,271
They don't remember
the last one.

251
00:16:11,311 --> 00:16:12,903
No. They don't.

252
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:20,542
Delysia's name in lights at the
Ambassador. What do you think of that?

253
00:16:21,655 --> 00:16:23,816
Well, it's certainly what
Delysia's always wanted.

254
00:16:26,593 --> 00:16:28,288
Joe, my dear,

255
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:31,923
I don't think I could ever forgive
myself if last night's misunderstanding

256
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:35,594
got in the way of something
so, so important to us both.

257
00:16:37,638 --> 00:16:41,369
I was wondering, could you
walk me home and let me explain?

258
00:16:44,912 --> 00:16:47,176
Of course, my dear.
Of course.

259
00:16:49,249 --> 00:16:50,773
Nice to have met you.

260
00:16:52,653 --> 00:16:55,121
Did you see the planes?
Weren't they magnificent?

261
00:17:11,004 --> 00:17:12,266
Madam?

262
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:14,636
Not now, thank you.

263
00:18:04,658 --> 00:18:06,819
Well, what do you know?

264
00:18:06,893 --> 00:18:09,453
It's my last night
singing at the club.

265
00:18:09,529 --> 00:18:11,429
I'm going to be a star.

266
00:18:13,066 --> 00:18:15,899
Well, aren't you going
to congratulate me?

267
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:18,199
I have done you
a disservice.

268
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:21,907
You have done what I asked.
That's your job.

269
00:18:22,709 --> 00:18:27,476
It may well be my job, but what I have
done is untrue to you and untrue to me.

270
00:18:27,547 --> 00:18:29,447
You have lost a man who
loves you for who you are,

271
00:18:29,516 --> 00:18:32,246
not for who
you pretend to be.

272
00:18:33,186 --> 00:18:36,849
And you, who are you to tell
me what's best for my life?

273
00:18:38,091 --> 00:18:41,219
I'm nobody. But apparently
an expert on love.

274
00:18:45,132 --> 00:18:46,190
No.

275
00:18:47,467 --> 00:18:48,957
I have no one.

276
00:18:49,036 --> 00:18:50,628
I am not
an expert on love.

277
00:18:50,704 --> 00:18:53,172
I am an expert on the
lack of love, Delysia.

278
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:57,370
And that is a fate from which I
wish most fervently to save you.

279
00:19:00,414 --> 00:19:01,813
Guinevere.

280
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:05,510
No pity, please. I endure
quite well, thank you.

281
00:19:21,234 --> 00:19:22,470
Where to, ma'am?

282
00:19:22,471 --> 00:19:24,169
Scarlet Peacock, please.

283
00:19:46,293 --> 00:19:48,761
Do you know what
my name is, Guinevere?

284
00:19:48,829 --> 00:19:52,162
I was under the impression
it was Delysia Lafosse.

285
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,224
Sarah Grubb.

286
00:19:56,703 --> 00:19:59,194
One of the Pittsburgh Grubbs.

287
00:19:59,272 --> 00:20:01,399
My father
is a steelworker.

288
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:06,404
No one else in the world
knows that, apart from Michael.

289
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,038
He doesn't judge me.

290
00:20:08,115 --> 00:20:09,742
No. He wouldn't.

291
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,977
But you do.
-Me?

292
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:13,611
I certainly do not.

293
00:20:13,687 --> 00:20:16,247
Oh, you think you don't,
but you do.

294
00:20:19,693 --> 00:20:22,287
This is all I own,
Guinevere.

295
00:20:24,398 --> 00:20:26,992
And two dozen pair
of shoes.

296
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,670
For all the fancy apartments
and fashion shows,

297
00:20:32,739 --> 00:20:35,708
do you know how close I am
to having nothing?

298
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:40,269
Every day I wake up
and I think,

299
00:20:40,347 --> 00:20:42,679
if I make the wrong move,
I could be out on that street,

300
00:20:42,749 --> 00:20:45,274
with no clothes,
no food, no job

301
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,311
and no friends.

302
00:20:50,257 --> 00:20:52,725
Just plain old
Sarah Grubb again.

303
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:56,152
Do you know what that's like?

304
00:20:56,229 --> 00:20:57,594
Yes, I do.

305
00:21:02,369 --> 00:21:03,597
You do?

306
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:06,469
In that at least,
we are alike.

307
00:21:09,876 --> 00:21:12,168
And now my mascara's gonna run.

308
00:21:12,169 --> 00:21:13,573
That will never do.

309
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:20,882
Here we are, ma'am.

310
00:21:36,603 --> 00:21:38,036
How are you?

311
00:21:38,605 --> 00:21:39,697
Hey.

312
00:21:43,276 --> 00:21:44,675
Having fun?

313
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:56,553
Sweetheart.
-Nick. Hi.

314
00:21:56,623 --> 00:22:00,559
Now, I've heard the news, darling.
Congratulations. It's the big time, huh?

315
00:22:00,994 --> 00:22:02,120
Oh.

316
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:03,924
I thought you'd
be furious.

317
00:22:03,997 --> 00:22:05,487
Furious, me? Why?

318
00:22:05,565 --> 00:22:08,090
No. You and me,
we're the same.

319
00:22:08,168 --> 00:22:12,434
We both get what we want
by bending a bit, don't we?

320
00:22:13,306 --> 00:22:15,866
I get it, D.
It's business.

321
00:22:18,011 --> 00:22:19,035
No, Nick, I...

322
00:22:19,112 --> 00:22:21,410
I'll see you back
at mine later.

323
00:22:24,584 --> 00:22:27,985
How can he just... He treats
me like I'm a common...

324
00:22:29,256 --> 00:22:30,871
You don't think of
me like that, do you?

325
00:22:30,872 --> 00:22:31,383
Of course not.

326
00:22:34,194 --> 00:22:35,684
Delysia!

327
00:22:35,762 --> 00:22:37,024
Darling!

328
00:22:40,967 --> 00:22:43,800
Darling, you look perfect, what?
Doesn't she?

329
00:22:47,073 --> 00:22:49,098
Guinevere, how lovely.

330
00:22:49,175 --> 00:22:52,042
To you, I owe a special
debt of gratitude.

331
00:22:52,379 --> 00:22:55,974
Champagne! The only thing as
delightful as my dear Delysia.

332
00:22:56,049 --> 00:22:59,348
Darling, come on, finish
your glass. There's plenty.

333
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,412
It's all back on.

334
00:23:02,489 --> 00:23:04,650
Darling,
that's marvelous.

335
00:23:04,724 --> 00:23:05,713
Did you hear
the news?

336
00:23:05,792 --> 00:23:08,124
These two lovebirds are
finally tying the knot.

337
00:23:08,194 --> 00:23:10,526
Congrats, dear fellow.
When's the happy day, what?

338
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:13,862
We were going to keep it to ourselves
for the present, but you know the ladies.

339
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:14,923
Oh, do I ever.

340
00:23:15,001 --> 00:23:17,026
Sorry, darling.
Couldn't keep it in.

341
00:23:17,103 --> 00:23:19,162
It's nice to see
you again, madam.

342
00:23:19,239 --> 00:23:21,366
May I add my
congratulations?

343
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:21,937
Let's dance!

344
00:23:21,938 --> 00:23:23,466
If you don't mind,
Edythe, I have a...

345
00:23:23,543 --> 00:23:24,908
Oh, you drone on, Joey.

346
00:23:24,978 --> 00:23:27,139
Leonard will take me for
a spin, won't you, Lenny?

347
00:23:27,213 --> 00:23:28,305
Be delighted, Edy.

348
00:23:28,381 --> 00:23:29,871
Delysia, Phil, come on.

349
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,281
Of course!

350
00:24:15,528 --> 00:24:17,519
Well, as we have
no conversation,

351
00:24:17,597 --> 00:24:20,430
I have no option but to
ask you for the next dance.

352
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,936
Alas, I can dance
nothing but the waltz.

353
00:24:46,259 --> 00:24:48,124
Are you all right?
-Yes.

354
00:24:48,194 --> 00:24:50,025
Well, to take
another woman's escort...

355
00:24:50,096 --> 00:24:53,588
You didn't take me,
I took you.

356
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:03,668
I'm sure Edythe can cope.

357
00:25:09,249 --> 00:25:11,342
What happened to that
particularly beautiful scarf

358
00:25:11,418 --> 00:25:13,181
you were wearing
at the fashion show?

359
00:25:13,253 --> 00:25:14,777
What are you
talking about?

360
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:21,384
Despite your most elegant transformation,
the body is still the same.

361
00:25:21,461 --> 00:25:23,088
Mr. Blomfield.

362
00:25:23,463 --> 00:25:26,261
As are the eyes. Most
fetching, if I may say.

363
00:25:26,332 --> 00:25:28,630
I'm not really sure
you should say.

364
00:25:28,702 --> 00:25:31,500
I'm sorry. Professional
habit. A bad one.

365
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:36,138
I have to remember you're
not like these people.

366
00:25:36,209 --> 00:25:38,370
Am I terribly
old-fashioned?

367
00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:40,737
Indeed you are.

368
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:43,140
And all the better for it.

369
00:25:44,818 --> 00:25:47,446
Am I making you
feel uncomfortable?

370
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:51,485
This is the most comfortable
I've felt all day.

371
00:26:28,895 --> 00:26:30,954
Ladies and gentlemen,

372
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:34,397
welcome to Nick Calderelli's
Scarlet Peacock.

373
00:26:39,906 --> 00:26:44,639
I'm delighted to introduce you tonight
to a very talented lady friend of mine.

374
00:26:44,711 --> 00:26:46,611
And she can sing, too.

375
00:26:48,281 --> 00:26:50,681
It's my pleasure
to bring you

376
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:52,779
Delysia Lafosse!

377
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:06,398
<i>You're too kind, really.</i>

378
00:27:08,568 --> 00:27:10,934
Hello, Michael.
How was prison?

379
00:27:11,971 --> 00:27:14,098
And to get us
in the mood,

380
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:16,608
<i>we'll start with
Hot Shoe Shimmy.</i>

381
00:27:19,112 --> 00:27:20,807
Change of program.

382
00:27:22,115 --> 00:27:23,810
<i>If I Didn't Care.</i>

383
00:27:32,792 --> 00:27:37,058
<i>If I didn't care</i>

384
00:27:39,766 --> 00:27:44,703
<i>More than words can say</i>

385
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:51,702
<i>If I didn't care</i>

386
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:58,149
<i>Would I feel this way?</i>

387
00:28:00,353 --> 00:28:04,119
<i>If this isn't love</i>

388
00:28:06,593 --> 00:28:12,156
<i>Then why do I thrill?</i>

389
00:28:13,199 --> 00:28:19,365
<i>And what makes my head go
'round and 'round</i>

390
00:28:19,973 --> 00:28:25,434
<i>While my heart stands still?</i>

391
00:28:26,045 --> 00:28:30,004
<i>If I didn't care</i>

392
00:28:32,719 --> 00:28:36,280
<i>Would it be the same?</i>

393
00:28:39,492 --> 00:28:45,397
<i>Would my every prayer
begin and end</i>

394
00:28:46,132 --> 00:28:50,831
<i>With just your name?</i>

395
00:28:52,906 --> 00:28:59,004
<i>And would I be sure
that this is love</i>

396
00:28:59,078 --> 00:29:02,707
<i>Beyond compare?</i>

397
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:08,583
<i>Would all this be true</i>

398
00:29:09,255 --> 00:29:11,815
<i>If I didn't care</i>

399
00:29:12,525 --> 00:29:14,186
<i>For</i>

400
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:16,626
<i>you?</i>

401
00:29:19,766 --> 00:29:22,667
<i>If I didn't care</i>

402
00:29:27,273 --> 00:29:29,798
<i>Would it be the same?</i>

403
00:29:34,547 --> 00:29:40,349
<i>Would my every prayer
begin and end</i>

404
00:29:41,387 --> 00:29:45,050
<i>With just your name?</i>

405
00:29:48,461 --> 00:29:54,957
<i>And would I be sure
that this is love</i>

406
00:29:55,034 --> 00:29:58,595
<i>Beyond compare?</i>

407
00:30:02,875 --> 00:30:05,673
<i>Would all this be true</i>

408
00:30:06,412 --> 00:30:09,040
<i>If I didn't care</i>

409
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:13,043
<i>For</i>

410
00:30:15,488 --> 00:30:17,581
<i>you?</i>

411
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:50,088
<i>Thank you, thank you.</i>

412
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:52,418
<i>Really.</i>

413
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:57,891
<i>Well, let's try something a
little more upbeat, shall we?</i>

414
00:31:06,606 --> 00:31:09,200
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is an air raid shelter!

415
00:31:09,275 --> 00:31:11,209
Sir, stay...
-I'm going home.

416
00:31:11,277 --> 00:31:12,642
You don't want to put
your wife in danger.

417
00:31:12,712 --> 00:31:14,009
My wife?
She doesn't know I'm here.

418
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:23,889
I'm here, Delysia.
-Guinevere, I'm scared.

419
00:31:23,956 --> 00:31:25,924
It's just a drill.
I'm sure it's just a drill.

420
00:31:26,025 --> 00:31:27,287
But it won't always be,
will it?

421
00:31:28,728 --> 00:31:29,752
We're going to war,
aren't we?

422
00:31:29,829 --> 00:31:31,592
Yes, we are.

423
00:31:31,664 --> 00:31:35,794
And that is why you must not waste
a second of this precious life.

424
00:31:35,868 --> 00:31:37,335
Listen to me.

425
00:31:37,403 --> 00:31:39,132
Once, I too
had ambitions.

426
00:31:39,205 --> 00:31:42,003
Not your grand ones.
Simple ambitions.

427
00:31:42,075 --> 00:31:44,839
Marriage, children
and a house of our own.

428
00:31:45,678 --> 00:31:48,169
He died.
In the mud in France.

429
00:31:48,848 --> 00:31:50,748
A good, solid man.

430
00:31:51,884 --> 00:31:54,478
You would call him
dull, no doubt,

431
00:31:54,554 --> 00:31:58,991
but he smiled whenever he saw me,
and we could've built a life on that.

432
00:32:00,526 --> 00:32:03,154
Your heart knows
the truth, Delysia.

433
00:32:03,229 --> 00:32:06,130
Trust it,
for life is short.

434
00:32:12,238 --> 00:32:13,569
Michael?

435
00:32:14,273 --> 00:32:15,570
Michael?

436
00:32:16,275 --> 00:32:17,742
Michael?

437
00:32:21,747 --> 00:32:22,771
Oh!

438
00:32:22,849 --> 00:32:24,840
Delysia!
My God. I...

439
00:32:25,518 --> 00:32:28,783
Nothing for 19 years and
then two in one day, what.

440
00:32:29,288 --> 00:32:30,949
I'm so sorry.

441
00:32:31,023 --> 00:32:33,548
The part's still yours,
darling.

442
00:32:36,295 --> 00:32:38,422
Well, that's all right, Phil.

443
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:41,831
You enjoy your Hortensia.
In every way.

444
00:32:41,901 --> 00:32:44,961
<i>It's just a drill, ladies and
gentlemen, it's just a drill.</i>

445
00:32:45,037 --> 00:32:46,732
<i>This is the safest
place in London.</i>

446
00:32:46,806 --> 00:32:48,740
<i>Come on, let's have
some drinks on the house.</i>

447
00:32:48,808 --> 00:32:50,799
<i>And some music, please!</i>

448
00:32:57,817 --> 00:32:59,182
Michael?

449
00:33:08,261 --> 00:33:09,523
Michael?

450
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:20,438
Michael, please wait!

451
00:33:22,441 --> 00:33:26,241
Delysia, you've made your
decision. I hope you'll be happy.

452
00:33:26,979 --> 00:33:29,971
Michael. Please. You have...

453
00:33:30,583 --> 00:33:32,847
Where do you think you're sneaking
off to? The night is young.

454
00:33:32,919 --> 00:33:34,716
You have the rest
of a set to sing.

455
00:33:34,787 --> 00:33:36,846
No, Nick,
I don't think so.

456
00:33:36,923 --> 00:33:39,016
Nobody walks
off my stage.

457
00:33:39,625 --> 00:33:41,354
She said no.

458
00:33:41,427 --> 00:33:42,485
What, and she does
what you say?

459
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:44,393
Never once, as a matter of
fact, but that's not the point.

460
00:33:44,463 --> 00:33:46,658
The point is she doesn't
want to sing. End of story.

461
00:33:46,732 --> 00:33:48,427
Let's go, Delysia.

462
00:33:48,834 --> 00:33:49,926
No.

463
00:33:51,037 --> 00:33:53,267
I'm warning you,
Calderelli.

464
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:54,998
You, warning me?

465
00:33:57,276 --> 00:33:59,073
After you, Delysia.

466
00:34:05,751 --> 00:34:07,480
Sock him in the jaw!

467
00:34:07,553 --> 00:34:08,679
What?

468
00:34:12,358 --> 00:34:14,758
I'm a pianist, damn it.
It could ruin me.

469
00:34:14,827 --> 00:34:16,920
Why, you pathetic...

470
00:34:19,198 --> 00:34:20,460
Darling.

471
00:34:20,566 --> 00:34:21,897
This is your fault.

472
00:34:21,968 --> 00:34:23,367
Is the offer still open?

473
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:24,630
Get up!

474
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:30,670
Well? Is it a yes
or is it a no?

475
00:34:30,977 --> 00:34:32,001
What?

476
00:34:32,078 --> 00:34:35,377
Will you doggone marry me
or will you doggone not?

477
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:54,126
Yes. God help me. Yes.

478
00:36:09,408 --> 00:36:11,876
I don't think
I can bear it again.

479
00:36:14,413 --> 00:36:15,880
Did you lose many?

480
00:36:15,948 --> 00:36:17,848
Just one. You?

481
00:36:19,518 --> 00:36:22,043
Almost every
school friend I had.

482
00:36:27,126 --> 00:36:29,390
One tries to forget.

483
00:36:29,862 --> 00:36:31,762
If only one could.

484
00:36:35,801 --> 00:36:38,964
You know, I distracted
myself with ridiculous things,

485
00:36:39,038 --> 00:36:41,131
youth, parties,
lingerie.

486
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:44,972
I mean, I trained in
socks, for goodness sake.

487
00:36:45,044 --> 00:36:46,409
Socks?

488
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:52,514
There's a great deal of engineering in
a gentleman's sock, I'll have you know.

489
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:54,644
Stitching of the heel...

490
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,746
By comparison, designing a
brassiere is a piece of cake.

491
00:36:57,823 --> 00:37:01,953
Not that there
aren't compensations.

492
00:37:02,027 --> 00:37:04,393
None of them
over 20, I imagine.

493
00:37:06,632 --> 00:37:08,930
And all very easy
on the eye.

494
00:37:10,236 --> 00:37:11,999
But you know what?

495
00:37:13,472 --> 00:37:14,962
I'm done with it.

496
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,736
I'm going back
to gentlemen's hosiery.

497
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:20,643
You know who you are
with an honest pair of socks.

498
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,311
You certainly do.

499
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:33,421
Told you about Gerry,
has she?

500
00:37:34,026 --> 00:37:36,586
Didn't take you long
to move on, hmm?

501
00:37:36,662 --> 00:37:37,754
Joe?

502
00:37:38,697 --> 00:37:40,392
Hello, Edythe.

503
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:44,300
Did she also tell you that she hangs
around the soup kitchen at the station?

504
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:48,932
A tramp masquerading as some
sort of social secretary, my God.

505
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:56,581
Goodbye,
Mr. Blomfield.

506
00:38:08,227 --> 00:38:10,422
No, actually,
she didn't.

507
00:38:11,197 --> 00:38:14,997
Neither about that,
nor about you and Gerry.

508
00:38:16,068 --> 00:38:19,162
But I'm grateful for
the truth, for a change.

509
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:58,070
Hello?

510
00:38:59,111 --> 00:39:00,408
Delysia?

511
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:11,379
Miss Lafosse?

512
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:19,758
Come on, come on,
the taxi's waiting.

513
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:22,499
Michael,
don't rush me!

514
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:26,329
Guinevere! Are you all
right? We've been so worried.

515
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:28,066
Perfectly well,
thank you.

516
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,677
We've been scouring London for you.

517
00:39:29,678 --> 00:39:30,335
Miss Lafosse...

518
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:32,400
You have not been at the roulette
wheel all night, have you?

519
00:39:32,478 --> 00:39:35,413
Please, Delysia,
I'm trying to apologize.

520
00:39:35,481 --> 00:39:39,076
I expect you've heard that I am
not a social secretary at all.

521
00:39:39,151 --> 00:39:41,847
I'm afraid I found
myself pretending.

522
00:39:42,688 --> 00:39:47,057
Miss Pettigrew, if that's you
pretending, then you're jolly good at it.

523
00:39:48,193 --> 00:39:49,319
Guinevere,

524
00:39:49,395 --> 00:39:52,956
Sarah Grubb is not going to
judge anybody for pretending.

525
00:39:53,032 --> 00:39:56,763
Come on, Grubb! This is
us, I'm afraid, Miss Pettigrew.

526
00:39:56,835 --> 00:39:58,769
Boat won't wait.

527
00:39:58,837 --> 00:40:00,737
Are you really going?
-Mmm-hmm!

528
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:03,575
To New York?
-Yep.

529
00:40:04,143 --> 00:40:05,633
How wonderful.

530
00:40:05,711 --> 00:40:08,475
But, Guinevere,
what will you do?

531
00:40:09,214 --> 00:40:11,182
Don't you worry
about me, petal.

532
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:15,414
Why, Miss Holt is holding a job
for me this very morning, I expect.

533
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:27,858
I will never forget the day
we spent together.

534
00:40:28,767 --> 00:40:30,166
Not ever.

535
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:33,203
Nor I.

536
00:40:39,144 --> 00:40:41,442
Oh, goodbye, Guinevere.
I love you.

537
00:40:41,513 --> 00:40:43,276
Off with you. Away.

538
00:40:46,852 --> 00:40:49,685
Oh, come and visit!
New York's bopping!

539
00:42:00,626 --> 00:42:02,025
Forgive the intrusion.

540
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:06,588
I'm glad to see
you're safe.

541
00:42:06,665 --> 00:42:08,326
Oh, yes. Quite safe.

542
00:42:14,506 --> 00:42:18,533
Am I right in thinking you're no
longer employed, Miss Pettigrew?

543
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:20,134
Quite correct.

544
00:42:20,212 --> 00:42:22,510
So you're free?
-Quite free.

545
00:42:23,348 --> 00:42:26,408
Might you be looking
for a social secretary?

546
00:42:26,485 --> 00:42:28,009
No. Absolutely not.

547
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:29,209
Oh.

548
00:42:32,024 --> 00:42:33,821
I'm looking for you.

549
00:42:35,394 --> 00:42:36,452
Me?

550
00:42:37,463 --> 00:42:41,422
I've been looking for you
all night, and, I believe

551
00:42:42,468 --> 00:42:44,231
all of my life.

552
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:47,902
If you'll have me.

553
00:42:53,278 --> 00:42:56,111
A nod of the head
will do me fine.

554
00:43:02,087 --> 00:43:05,454
And I am, at a stroke,
the happiest man in London.

555
00:43:22,441 --> 00:43:24,739
What a night.
-What a morning.

556
00:43:25,878 --> 00:43:28,226
Have you eaten,
my dear Guinevere?

557
00:43:28,227 --> 00:43:28,779
Oh, Joe,

558
00:43:28,847 --> 00:43:32,283
I have not eaten for
a very, very long time.

559
