1
00:00:59,957 --> 00:01:02,107
What do you think
your dreams mean, Jackson?

2
00:01:02,317 --> 00:01:05,229
They're about relationships,
commitments.

3
00:01:05,717 --> 00:01:08,550
Do you think a commitment
with a woman is death?

4
00:01:08,917 --> 00:01:11,636
Yeah, right. See,
you meet somebody, right?

5
00:01:11,837 --> 00:01:14,397
You are having a good time,
vibing together...

6
00:01:14,637 --> 00:01:16,707
...then love drags its ass up into it.

7
00:01:26,037 --> 00:01:28,790
- What do women want from you?
- That's easy.

8
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:33,113
They want money, multiple orgasms...

9
00:01:33,317 --> 00:01:36,468
...and beautiful shoes
that don't hurt like hell.

10
00:01:36,717 --> 00:01:40,312
That's really sexist.
Except for the part about the shoes.

11
00:01:59,717 --> 00:02:01,548
I'll be 29 on my next birthday.

12
00:02:02,117 --> 00:02:05,826
- Why does that bother you?
- It's one step from the big 3-0.

13
00:02:07,357 --> 00:02:12,112
I can't keep blaming my lack of
a relationship on being a kid anymore.

14
00:02:12,357 --> 00:02:15,394
I broke up with three women
in the last two months.

15
00:02:24,837 --> 00:02:27,067
Maybe you should become celibate.

16
00:02:27,437 --> 00:02:30,076
Put the physical behind
your spiritual self.

17
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:33,468
Sorry, doc, but my spiritual self
needs a booty.

18
00:02:40,637 --> 00:02:42,389
I have an assignment for you.

19
00:02:42,637 --> 00:02:45,470
I want you to get out there
and date some more.

20
00:02:45,717 --> 00:02:48,311
In fact, try to meet a woman tonight.

21
00:02:48,797 --> 00:02:50,310
I'm shooting hoops with the fellas.

22
00:02:50,557 --> 00:02:52,593
Then we hang.
It's a weekly tradition.

23
00:02:53,117 --> 00:02:55,312
Then do it whenever.

24
00:02:55,557 --> 00:02:58,549
The next time, open up
your heart to her.

25
00:02:59,117 --> 00:03:02,871
Try being a friend,
before you become her lover.

26
00:03:03,997 --> 00:03:05,066
I can handle that.

27
00:03:11,837 --> 00:03:13,987
<i>Motion to suppress, denied.</i>

28
00:03:14,397 --> 00:03:16,957
Motion for evidentiary hearing,
denied.

29
00:03:17,757 --> 00:03:19,952
Motion for continuance, denied.

30
00:03:20,717 --> 00:03:23,277
All of my motions denied?
May I ask why?

31
00:03:23,917 --> 00:03:26,306
Your affidavit wasn't based
on credible facts.

32
00:03:26,557 --> 00:03:31,472
This court will not tolerate that.
Motions denied.

33
00:03:32,477 --> 00:03:34,274
Thank you, Your Honour.

34
00:03:35,437 --> 00:03:37,997
- Bitch.
- What did you say?

35
00:03:42,157 --> 00:03:44,113
Come on, Shawshank, let's go.

36
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:45,915
The judge is springing you.

37
00:03:46,157 --> 00:03:49,194
It's about goddamn time.
That woman is crazy.

38
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:53,635
Come on. You're lucky you ain't
working for her cranky ass.

39
00:03:54,357 --> 00:03:59,272
Yes, Sheila, I am meeting the brothers
after work for our game.

40
00:04:00,237 --> 00:04:03,673
Yes, we are going
to the club afterwards.

41
00:04:05,117 --> 00:04:09,076
Now, how is my baby gonna miss me
when she's gonna be asleep?

42
00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:13,268
<i>What if I ran the streets?
I have a job too.</i>

43
00:04:13,517 --> 00:04:15,712
You shouldn't talk like that.
You need Jesus.

44
00:04:15,917 --> 00:04:18,272
The European earnings report
just came in.

45
00:04:18,517 --> 00:04:21,873
Lovely. I'll look at them tonight.

46
00:04:22,117 --> 00:04:24,472
Is there anything else
I can do for you?

47
00:04:24,677 --> 00:04:27,510
- No, Sandra, thank you. I'm straight.
- Nothing?

48
00:04:27,757 --> 00:04:29,987
- No, I'm straight.
- Nothing at all?

49
00:04:30,237 --> 00:04:33,673
I'm cool. I'm cool.
Take care of yourself, okay?

50
00:04:34,157 --> 00:04:35,875
Yes, Terry White.

51
00:04:36,757 --> 00:04:41,069
Hey, baby. Yeah, I'm packing up
right now to get out of here.

52
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:45,706
Yeah, it's all set for tonight.
Baby, you got nothing to worry about...

53
00:04:45,957 --> 00:04:48,266
Oh, shit. Baby, I gotta go.

54
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:54,272
She's gonna need to take her medicine
and keep her throat warm.

55
00:04:54,477 --> 00:04:58,755
Thanks. So, doctor, would
you like to meet my sister?

56
00:04:59,557 --> 00:05:00,910
She's really great.

57
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:05,993
I'm kind of off the market right now.

58
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:10,792
Hey! You ain't got time for me now?

59
00:05:11,037 --> 00:05:15,474
You had time when you wanted to have
sex with me, but now you're busy.

60
00:06:00,917 --> 00:06:02,987
Yo, Derrick,
I did not think you saw me.

61
00:06:03,357 --> 00:06:04,870
I do what I can, baby.

62
00:06:05,077 --> 00:06:07,272
- That was luck.
- It won't happen again.

63
00:06:07,757 --> 00:06:10,112
You want to hear
what happened to me today?

64
00:06:10,317 --> 00:06:11,955
I'm packing up my stuff.

65
00:06:12,637 --> 00:06:14,707
I turn around and a temp's
in front of me.

66
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:16,515
I'm not gonna lie. She was banging.

67
00:06:16,717 --> 00:06:18,708
This girl jumps on my shit, man.

68
00:06:19,717 --> 00:06:21,196
I think you're lying!

69
00:06:21,397 --> 00:06:25,470
Hey, D. How long you known me, baby?
I don't lie about my shit.

70
00:06:26,837 --> 00:06:29,556
That shit always happens to me.
How was it, Terry?

71
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:31,829
- I didn't do it.
- Shit.

72
00:06:32,037 --> 00:06:33,834
What, you A.C. Green now?

73
00:06:34,037 --> 00:06:37,313
I lectured her about compromising
a brother at work...

74
00:06:37,557 --> 00:06:38,672
...then I left.

75
00:06:38,917 --> 00:06:41,306
I would've waxed that ass
all over the office.

76
00:06:41,557 --> 00:06:44,071
There would've been X eroxes
of my nuts on everybody's desk.

77
00:06:44,277 --> 00:06:46,916
You see the problem is,
you need help, bro.

78
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:49,466
Me and my girl, BeBe,
got something solid.

79
00:06:49,677 --> 00:06:52,237
I'll make a declaration
right here, right now.

80
00:06:52,757 --> 00:06:56,067
From this moment forward,
I'm a one-woman man.

81
00:06:56,517 --> 00:07:00,715
After two months of dating? That's
gotta be a record for being whipped.

82
00:07:01,157 --> 00:07:03,352
You're not talking
about being whipped.

83
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:05,509
Terry, we know you. You can't change.

84
00:07:05,757 --> 00:07:08,510
What about when you talked
to the girl and her mom...

85
00:07:08,757 --> 00:07:11,351
...and then they both found out?
- I remember that.

86
00:07:11,557 --> 00:07:14,993
That was a long time ago.
I'm not like that anymore.

87
00:07:15,197 --> 00:07:17,665
If you're changing, Terry,
I'm changing too.

88
00:07:17,877 --> 00:07:21,426
- It's about time.
- As of now, I'm through with sisters.

89
00:07:22,437 --> 00:07:24,268
That's a broken record, D.

90
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:27,469
I'm serious this time, man.
You know Carla, the judge?

91
00:07:28,157 --> 00:07:31,194
She locked me up because
she's an evil, bitter, black woman.

92
00:07:31,397 --> 00:07:33,513
Did you forget that you had sex
with her...

93
00:07:33,757 --> 00:07:35,827
...dumped her and called her
a "bitch" in the courtroom?

94
00:07:36,037 --> 00:07:37,550
What's your point, man?

95
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:40,146
Maybe she had other reasons
to do that.

96
00:07:40,357 --> 00:07:41,426
The boy's ignorant.

97
00:07:41,717 --> 00:07:45,676
All sisters bring drama. No matter
what you do, it ain't good enough.

98
00:07:45,877 --> 00:07:49,313
I'm tired of the fake hair.
The "that's my baby's father."

99
00:07:49,557 --> 00:07:50,387
The excess weight.

100
00:07:50,597 --> 00:07:54,590
They're giving out government cheese
sandwiches with the fake hair.

101
00:07:54,837 --> 00:07:57,067
- What does that tell you?
- That you're a dumb-ass.

102
00:07:57,277 --> 00:07:59,666
You give up on sisters,
you give up on yourself.

103
00:07:59,917 --> 00:08:01,270
Word!

104
00:08:01,517 --> 00:08:04,748
- I think Brian may have a point.
- Thank you.

105
00:08:04,957 --> 00:08:07,517
It's not colour,
but what's inside that counts.

106
00:08:07,717 --> 00:08:11,266
Did your wife tell you that before
or after she unscrewed your dick.

107
00:08:11,597 --> 00:08:14,065
Don't listen to him, D.
We're here, Jack.

108
00:08:14,317 --> 00:08:17,707
No, we're not there. I'm not going
out on the sisters like you.

109
00:08:17,957 --> 00:08:21,233
I haven't found the right one.
Gotta look harder.

110
00:08:21,437 --> 00:08:22,950
See, now I can dig that.

111
00:08:23,157 --> 00:08:26,866
Let's keep it real.
We're single, black, professional men.

112
00:08:27,117 --> 00:08:29,870
- We're the cream of the crop.
- I'll keep it real for you.

113
00:08:30,077 --> 00:08:33,513
We're the cream of the crop. You're
the shit on the bottom of the barrel.

114
00:08:34,357 --> 00:08:39,556
We deserve the best, and now,
the sisters ain't up to the job.

115
00:08:39,877 --> 00:08:42,914
You're wrong. When I met Sheila,
I snapped her up.

116
00:08:43,237 --> 00:08:44,511
That and she got pregnant.

117
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:47,510
No, it didn't have nothing
to do with that.

118
00:08:47,757 --> 00:08:50,225
We were gonna get married.
We were in love.

119
00:08:50,437 --> 00:08:53,076
Love, there's a word to look up
in the dictionary.

120
00:08:53,277 --> 00:08:57,668
It's after "ignorant"
and just before "stupid," stupid.

121
00:09:08,997 --> 00:09:11,716
- We'll be at the bar.
- Where's Terry? He's missing.

122
00:09:11,957 --> 00:09:14,710
Went back to work on that temp
if he's smart.

123
00:09:14,957 --> 00:09:18,552
No, he will be here, trust me.
He will be here.

124
00:09:19,037 --> 00:09:21,756
- Oh, damn.
- Come on, B, now why'd you do that?

125
00:09:21,997 --> 00:09:24,795
- I told you, I'm done with them.
- She looks cool.

126
00:09:25,037 --> 00:09:26,993
Go and work
your brown magic, man.

127
00:09:27,237 --> 00:09:28,386
- You want me to?
- Work it.

128
00:09:28,637 --> 00:09:30,867
All right, all right. Check it out.

129
00:09:33,717 --> 00:09:37,392
Excuse me. I'm sorry about
that little thing over there.

130
00:09:37,637 --> 00:09:40,151
I had the worst day in court.

131
00:09:40,397 --> 00:09:41,910
- So you're a lawyer?
- Yeah.

132
00:09:42,157 --> 00:09:44,432
- I used to work for a lawyer.
- Really?

133
00:09:44,637 --> 00:09:47,470
- Hey, I'm Brian.
- I'm Lamuzindah.

134
00:09:48,437 --> 00:09:50,712
- La moo what?
- Lamuzindah.

135
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:52,106
"Goddess of light."

136
00:09:52,317 --> 00:09:55,468
Okay. Cool. Do your thing.

137
00:09:55,677 --> 00:09:59,033
You know what? You just look
so, so nurturing to me.

138
00:10:00,717 --> 00:10:02,833
Do you have any kids, you know?

139
00:10:05,637 --> 00:10:09,391
Actually, I do. You want to see
some pictures of Tanesha and Tenaka?

140
00:10:09,717 --> 00:10:11,150
I got them right here.

141
00:10:11,397 --> 00:10:13,069
No. Slow down with the kids.

142
00:10:13,277 --> 00:10:14,869
Have a nice evening.

143
00:10:15,757 --> 00:10:17,668
Tanesha and Tenaka.

144
00:10:18,037 --> 00:10:19,265
The defence rests.

145
00:10:19,717 --> 00:10:21,116
Forget you then.

146
00:10:21,637 --> 00:10:24,470
Fellas, fellas, fellas.
Sorry I'm late.

147
00:10:24,677 --> 00:10:28,909
Bartender, I need some of your best
champagne and five glasses.

148
00:10:29,357 --> 00:10:32,429
- Champagne?
- It's always so crowded in here.

149
00:10:32,637 --> 00:10:35,470
- Nice of you to bring a date.
- Right, well, listen up.

150
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:39,670
Tonight is a little different.
You ready to do this?

151
00:10:40,917 --> 00:10:44,671
BeBe and I, we're getting married.

152
00:10:48,117 --> 00:10:50,915
Hey, Terry. Congratulations, baby.

153
00:10:51,157 --> 00:10:53,068
- Hey, good luck.
- That's nice.

154
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:54,995
- Congratulations, T.
- Thank you.

155
00:10:55,317 --> 00:10:57,467
- There goes my buzz.
- What is your problem?

156
00:10:57,717 --> 00:11:00,277
Now, hold on, baby. Let me get this.

157
00:11:00,477 --> 00:11:02,433
I'll slide out of your way.

158
00:11:03,077 --> 00:11:07,309
Look, Brian, you and I,
we have never liked each other.

159
00:11:07,557 --> 00:11:08,785
Okay, that's cool.

160
00:11:09,037 --> 00:11:13,952
But understand this. I will
not take any shit off of you.

161
00:11:16,237 --> 00:11:20,025
I'm at the gun range twice a week,
and I'm licensed to correct a nigga.

162
00:11:21,357 --> 00:11:22,346
Come on, now, baby.

163
00:11:23,717 --> 00:11:25,275
I'm going to the ladies' room.

164
00:11:27,317 --> 00:11:30,354
- Did she take my drink?
- You dis my girl in front of me?

165
00:11:30,557 --> 00:11:32,787
Yo, Terry, I'm sorry. I was shocked.

166
00:11:32,997 --> 00:11:34,635
Me too, that you didn't get
your ass whipped.

167
00:11:34,837 --> 00:11:39,115
Terry, you said you'd get married
two minutes before you dropped dead.

168
00:11:39,317 --> 00:11:41,706
Yeah, but that was
a long time ago, man.

169
00:11:42,117 --> 00:11:43,232
I have changed.

170
00:11:43,437 --> 00:11:47,749
I'll be 29 years old. I think
it's about time I settle down.

171
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,515
Twenty-nine's not old, though.

172
00:11:49,717 --> 00:11:51,787
No, but how long are
you supposed to wait?

173
00:11:52,877 --> 00:11:55,311
Wait, I thought that's what we wanted.

174
00:11:55,557 --> 00:11:57,388
You know, love, happiness.

175
00:11:57,637 --> 00:12:02,267
Look, Al Green, love and happiness is
one thing, but this is marriage.

176
00:12:02,477 --> 00:12:05,435
Marriage is not something
you jump into, Terry.

177
00:12:05,637 --> 00:12:08,947
Eighty. I mean, you know,
you're wearing a diaper...

178
00:12:09,157 --> 00:12:10,795
Jack, man, you are not old.

179
00:12:10,997 --> 00:12:12,874
Will you shut your old ass up?

180
00:12:13,077 --> 00:12:15,796
Two months isn't enough time
to know if the booty's right.

181
00:12:16,037 --> 00:12:18,790
Stop this nonsense.
Is this, "piss on Terry" night?

182
00:12:18,997 --> 00:12:22,876
Terry, look, we're your friends.
We just want what's best for you.

183
00:12:23,077 --> 00:12:27,832
Check this out. BeBe is a good woman.
I love this girl.

184
00:12:28,397 --> 00:12:30,786
- I'm sorry, but, man...
- She does her own thing.

185
00:12:31,037 --> 00:12:33,187
She makes good money
at the phone company.

186
00:12:33,437 --> 00:12:35,905
- She's got a job.
- At least, she's got a job.

187
00:12:36,157 --> 00:12:38,227
- She's fine as hell.
- Hey.

188
00:12:38,437 --> 00:12:40,667
Ain't nobody said anything about that.

189
00:12:40,877 --> 00:12:41,992
Thank you. Shit!

190
00:12:42,197 --> 00:12:45,314
T, you're my boy. I'm happy for you.
Congratulations.

191
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:47,195
That's right. Thank you.

192
00:12:47,437 --> 00:12:49,667
Hey, me too.
Best of luck, baby boy.

193
00:12:49,877 --> 00:12:50,866
I appreciate that.

194
00:12:51,077 --> 00:12:54,547
Yo, Terry. You know this is fucked up,
right? But you're my man.

195
00:12:54,757 --> 00:12:55,906
Congratulations.

196
00:12:56,877 --> 00:12:58,515
Congratulations, man.

197
00:12:59,397 --> 00:13:01,706
I don't know why, but I'll accept that.

198
00:13:01,957 --> 00:13:05,666
Now, I see the champagne has arrived.
We do need to be drinking it.

199
00:13:05,877 --> 00:13:08,914
I got the toast.
To our boy, Terry, here.

200
00:13:09,117 --> 00:13:12,234
And his beautiful girl, wearing
the hell out of that red dress.

201
00:13:13,117 --> 00:13:17,872
And may they have love, happiness,
and all that other shit.

202
00:13:18,117 --> 00:13:19,436
All right!

203
00:13:22,557 --> 00:13:23,592
Dr. Smith?

204
00:13:23,957 --> 00:13:25,515
- Dr. Smith?
- Hey.

205
00:13:26,437 --> 00:13:29,474
- How you doing?
- I went down the slide by myself.

206
00:13:29,837 --> 00:13:31,429
Do you want a lollipop?

207
00:13:31,837 --> 00:13:33,748
- Is she better?
- She's much better.

208
00:13:33,957 --> 00:13:35,390
- How've you been?
- I've been all right.

209
00:13:35,637 --> 00:13:37,673
I was just wondering if maybe...

210
00:13:40,197 --> 00:13:41,186
Don't stand there.

211
00:13:43,757 --> 00:13:45,110
Do something.

212
00:13:46,757 --> 00:13:47,746
That's good.

213
00:13:49,877 --> 00:13:51,071
That's perfect.

214
00:13:51,877 --> 00:13:53,196
I like that.

215
00:13:55,837 --> 00:13:58,670
- Jackson Smith. How you doing?
- I'm Denise.

216
00:13:58,877 --> 00:14:00,515
Do I have potential or what?

217
00:14:01,077 --> 00:14:02,988
You know that little girl?

218
00:14:03,237 --> 00:14:06,274
Yeah, she's one of my patients.
I'm a doctor.

219
00:14:07,117 --> 00:14:08,869
Why do you say it like that?

220
00:14:09,117 --> 00:14:11,995
Like, "I'm a doctor."
Like I'm Zeus, king of the gods.

221
00:14:12,237 --> 00:14:15,468
- No, I didn't mean it that way.
- No, I know you didn't.

222
00:14:15,717 --> 00:14:19,949
I'm a freelance photographer,
but I guess you could see that.

223
00:14:20,197 --> 00:14:21,676
An artist?

224
00:14:22,357 --> 00:14:23,676
I like that.

225
00:14:23,917 --> 00:14:26,477
What does your boyfriend think
about that?

226
00:14:26,717 --> 00:14:27,786
That's smooth.

227
00:14:28,037 --> 00:14:31,746
But I don't have a boyfriend,
and I'm not looking for one.

228
00:14:32,397 --> 00:14:35,070
Good. Because I don't
have a girlfriend.

229
00:14:35,717 --> 00:14:37,628
And I'm not looking for one.

230
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:39,266
Good.

231
00:14:47,997 --> 00:14:51,910
Oh, my God. Girl, you are gonna wear
me out. Don't you ever get tired?

232
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:53,146
Nope.

233
00:14:54,557 --> 00:14:59,392
I shouldn't even be doing this until
after we're married. I'm a good girl.

234
00:14:59,637 --> 00:15:03,266
Okay, "good girl," that's real cute
and everything but trust me...

235
00:15:03,517 --> 00:15:05,553
...if you weren't,
we might not get married.

236
00:15:05,797 --> 00:15:07,674
- Shut up!
- I'm keeping it real.

237
00:15:07,917 --> 00:15:10,306
- I got needs.
- Yeah, needs.

238
00:15:10,557 --> 00:15:12,866
You know Daddy's just playing with you.

239
00:15:14,317 --> 00:15:17,150
We need to get those
invitations out soon.

240
00:15:17,357 --> 00:15:20,110
And my parents are flying
in a few weeks before.

241
00:15:20,357 --> 00:15:24,270
- And the wedding planner, he's...
- Hey, hey, hey. Will you hush?

242
00:15:24,517 --> 00:15:27,315
Can we stay in the moment?
I know all of that.

243
00:15:27,557 --> 00:15:29,513
Who got this party started?

244
00:15:29,757 --> 00:15:33,272
Girl, I cannot wait
to make you Mrs. Terry White.

245
00:15:38,717 --> 00:15:40,992
Hey, whoa. Okay, now wait a minute.

246
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,587
You promised me that gun
would never be here.

247
00:15:43,797 --> 00:15:46,675
I know. I'm sorry, baby.
I forgot to take it back.

248
00:15:46,877 --> 00:15:50,506
- You know I hate that damn thing.
- I know. Don't be mad.

249
00:15:50,757 --> 00:15:54,272
- I got something to make it up to you.
- Oh, yeah, what you got?

250
00:15:54,757 --> 00:15:58,272
As much as I'd like to,
unless you got some Viagra...

251
00:15:58,477 --> 00:16:00,672
...Mr. Chubby needs a few minutes.
- He doesn't.

252
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:02,913
- Why not?
- I got skills.

253
00:16:03,157 --> 00:16:06,866
Hey. Come on. Oh, okay.

254
00:16:08,237 --> 00:16:10,990
Hey, girl, we gotta get
Janel some new books.

255
00:16:11,237 --> 00:16:13,512
I got Dr. Seuss coming out of my ass.

256
00:16:13,757 --> 00:16:16,317
I know, she does the same thing to me.

257
00:16:16,557 --> 00:16:21,506
I suppose Terry's having a bachelor
party with lots of naked hos.

258
00:16:21,757 --> 00:16:24,715
Yes, he is. You know,
I never thought Terry would fall.

259
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:27,272
He's got me feeling
like an old married man.

260
00:16:27,517 --> 00:16:31,351
All this excitement over Terry
is a bunch of trouble for nothing.

261
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:33,866
First of all, he is not
the husband type.

262
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:37,114
He and that Brian have bed-hopped
ever since we've known them.

263
00:16:37,477 --> 00:16:38,466
Terry ain't shit.

264
00:16:38,677 --> 00:16:40,508
He's gonna give that up? Please!

265
00:16:40,757 --> 00:16:43,908
A crackhead has a better chance
in a weightlifting contest.

266
00:16:45,957 --> 00:16:50,075
You are funny. Boy, that was
a good one. Crackhead, weights.

267
00:16:50,717 --> 00:16:52,673
You crack me up.

268
00:16:53,837 --> 00:16:58,627
- It sounds like the coast is clear.
- Yeah.

269
00:17:02,077 --> 00:17:04,875
You go on, express yourself.
Let me get that for you.

270
00:17:05,077 --> 00:17:07,875
- Oh, no! No!
- No?! No!

271
00:17:08,157 --> 00:17:11,388
- Baby, what is wrong now?
- I'm just not ready.

272
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:13,508
You're not ready?! You promised!

273
00:17:14,037 --> 00:17:17,791
But, but I've been thinking,
and I just can't do it right now.

274
00:17:17,997 --> 00:17:21,467
Sheila, come on, now. We've been
married for three long years.

275
00:17:21,677 --> 00:17:24,271
- I know, but...
- But what?

276
00:17:25,157 --> 00:17:27,671
- It's nasty.
- What the...?!

277
00:17:32,557 --> 00:17:34,912
Hell, I'm all calmed down.

278
00:17:35,317 --> 00:17:39,390
Come on, now. Come here.
Yes, I know.

279
00:17:39,637 --> 00:17:40,865
You're all tense.

280
00:17:41,117 --> 00:17:45,395
Lookit, relax. Relax.
Relax your jaws too. Relax.

281
00:17:45,637 --> 00:17:48,674
Yes, yes. You see?

282
00:17:48,917 --> 00:17:52,466
Speak into the mike. That's good.
See? See?

283
00:17:52,717 --> 00:17:55,231
- Oh, no!
- No? Damn it!

284
00:17:55,437 --> 00:17:59,749
You got me hard as Chinese arithmetic
in here and you bullshitting me.

285
00:18:01,157 --> 00:18:03,193
Derrick, why did you come in here?

286
00:18:03,437 --> 00:18:05,268
Why are you drinking now?

287
00:18:05,477 --> 00:18:08,708
I am a grown man, and I cannot
get head from my wife!

288
00:18:09,437 --> 00:18:11,826
Why don't you just go tell
our daughter?

289
00:18:12,597 --> 00:18:14,986
Look, Sheila,
we have talked about this.

290
00:18:15,237 --> 00:18:18,627
We went to the counsellor.
You said you were ready.

291
00:18:18,837 --> 00:18:21,715
I know, but I was eating
a banana earlier today...

292
00:18:21,957 --> 00:18:23,868
...and I gagged on it.

293
00:18:24,397 --> 00:18:26,627
Don't gag on my banana,
and we can get going.

294
00:18:26,957 --> 00:18:29,107
Derrick, honey, I can't.

295
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:31,387
- I do it to you.
- I don't ask you to.

296
00:18:31,597 --> 00:18:33,155
You do not stop me either.

297
00:18:34,237 --> 00:18:37,070
Okay, well, fine, you don't have
to do it anymore.

298
00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:39,273
That's the difference between us.

299
00:18:39,477 --> 00:18:41,911
I don't mind doing it.
I even like it.

300
00:18:42,117 --> 00:18:44,506
So, if I had a dick,
would you suck it?

301
00:18:46,437 --> 00:18:48,553
What kind of question is that?
You ain't no man.

302
00:18:49,037 --> 00:18:53,110
Just answer the question.
If I had a dick, would you suck it?

303
00:18:53,357 --> 00:18:57,873
Yes, I would, wearing a Viking hat
and a Little League chest protector!

304
00:18:58,117 --> 00:19:01,075
- Derrick, baby!
- I paid my dues.

305
00:19:01,477 --> 00:19:02,956
Baby, Derrick, Derrick.

306
00:19:03,157 --> 00:19:07,867
All my life I was taught that
good girls just don't do that.

307
00:19:08,157 --> 00:19:11,467
My mother told me that
if I did that, I would get cancer.

308
00:19:11,677 --> 00:19:15,352
I am dealing with some serious
psychological barriers here.

309
00:19:15,557 --> 00:19:19,072
Your mama sucked so much dick,
she walks around on her knees.

310
00:19:19,277 --> 00:19:22,633
- My mother is a saint!
- She must be Saint Suck-a-Dick.

311
00:19:22,837 --> 00:19:25,909
- Your mama is senile.
- See, my mama got an excuse.

312
00:19:26,157 --> 00:19:27,909
Your mama's fucked up for no reason.

313
00:19:28,157 --> 00:19:30,466
- You hit me with that again...
- You gonna hit me?

314
00:19:30,717 --> 00:19:33,550
Go ahead, beat me, lke, beat me!

315
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:37,954
I'm gonna watch TV. I don't want
to talk about this.

316
00:19:38,157 --> 00:19:41,274
Have a banana. Get freaky
with a peach for all I care.

317
00:19:41,957 --> 00:19:44,676
Derrick, we have a daughter.

318
00:19:44,877 --> 00:19:47,345
Will you advise her to go down
on her boyfriend?

319
00:19:47,557 --> 00:19:50,833
Yes, right after I tell her
that it don't cause cancer.

320
00:19:51,437 --> 00:19:54,270
Nasty little thing!

321
00:19:54,677 --> 00:19:57,066
Suck my dick, suck my dick,
suck my dick.

322
00:19:57,277 --> 00:19:58,995
It's good for your skin!

323
00:19:59,557 --> 00:20:03,345
You've known me for a while,
and all of a sudden, you ask me out.

324
00:20:03,637 --> 00:20:05,468
What took you so long?

325
00:20:06,157 --> 00:20:10,673
Well, you could say I went looking
for love in all the wrong damn places.

326
00:20:11,637 --> 00:20:13,275
Listen...

327
00:20:14,837 --> 00:20:16,031
- Jesse.
- Jesse, right.

328
00:20:16,237 --> 00:20:19,468
Right. Right. I got some work
to do, baby. So...

329
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:22,635
Sure, I can go.
I have an early class tomorrow.

330
00:20:22,837 --> 00:20:24,509
Right. What is it you teach?

331
00:20:25,237 --> 00:20:27,705
Self-defence classes. Karate.

332
00:20:27,957 --> 00:20:30,471
Karate. Right, yeah.
I remember. I remember.

333
00:20:31,637 --> 00:20:33,912
Brian, I know this was
spur-of-the-moment...

334
00:20:34,157 --> 00:20:37,866
...but if you ever want to hook up
again, just call me.

335
00:20:39,917 --> 00:20:43,432
Hey, hey, hold up, hold up,
hold up. Stay, relax.

336
00:20:43,637 --> 00:20:45,593
- You know, just relax.
- Okay.

337
00:20:45,797 --> 00:20:48,550
I have this amazing bottle of wine.
Would you like some?

338
00:20:48,757 --> 00:20:51,794
- Sure. Where is it?
- In the kitchen. Let me get...

339
00:20:51,997 --> 00:20:53,715
Oh, no, I got it.

340
00:20:59,357 --> 00:21:01,507
Can you make me a sandwich
while you in there?

341
00:21:01,757 --> 00:21:02,872
Okay.

342
00:21:03,117 --> 00:21:06,666
"Okay." That's what
I'm talking about.

343
00:21:09,517 --> 00:21:13,669
You know, Denise,
I hope you don't feel nervous...

344
00:21:13,877 --> 00:21:18,667
...about us, you know, doing
it like this on the first date.

345
00:21:18,877 --> 00:21:20,515
Why would I be nervous?

346
00:21:20,757 --> 00:21:23,635
I picked you up and I got you
into bed like this.

347
00:21:24,757 --> 00:21:27,590
- Women tend to feel self-conscious.
- Really?

348
00:21:27,837 --> 00:21:30,112
Oh, okay. How about this?

349
00:21:30,357 --> 00:21:32,587
I picked you up and got you in bed.

350
00:21:32,837 --> 00:21:35,476
That would make you
a slut puppy, wouldn't it?

351
00:21:35,917 --> 00:21:38,477
I like that, but you can't
call a man a slut.

352
00:21:38,717 --> 00:21:41,072
- And why is that?
- It's redundant.

353
00:21:43,117 --> 00:21:46,075
The only reason why
I brought that up is...

354
00:21:46,317 --> 00:21:48,990
...because I kind of have this issue.

355
00:21:50,357 --> 00:21:51,472
What's that?

356
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:54,874
Well, it's like...
You know, it's...

357
00:21:57,277 --> 00:21:59,472
Forget I even brought that up.

358
00:22:09,117 --> 00:22:10,675
Jackson, you okay?

359
00:22:14,637 --> 00:22:16,229
I can't talk about this.

360
00:22:22,277 --> 00:22:24,472
Do you know why I became
a photographer?

361
00:22:25,437 --> 00:22:27,905
You get to capture
all of life's moments...

362
00:22:28,157 --> 00:22:30,876
...all of the turning points
and freeze them.

363
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:34,556
Well, think of us as a picture.

364
00:22:35,557 --> 00:22:40,073
If you tell me your problem, we'd
be making a turning point together.

365
00:22:45,117 --> 00:22:47,870
- You crazy, you know?
- Yeah, everybody says that.

366
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:50,677
But I like it. I like that.

367
00:22:51,157 --> 00:22:52,590
Okay, it's like this:

368
00:22:53,317 --> 00:22:55,114
Once I meet a woman, right?

369
00:22:55,357 --> 00:22:59,509
And I get to know her a little bit
and we become intimate.

370
00:22:59,757 --> 00:23:04,911
When I get into the relationship and
we start talking about commitment...

371
00:23:05,157 --> 00:23:06,875
...I just freeze up.

372
00:23:07,957 --> 00:23:11,074
The only way I know how
to save myself is to...

373
00:23:12,437 --> 00:23:14,234
...cut the woman out of my life.

374
00:23:15,917 --> 00:23:19,068
Damn. Well, I see
how that's a problem.

375
00:23:19,837 --> 00:23:21,475
But we all have problems, Jackson.

376
00:23:21,717 --> 00:23:24,868
If life were simple, we'd all
be doing something else.

377
00:23:26,317 --> 00:23:30,595
So wait, you're not just gonna get
your clothes on and run out of here?

378
00:23:30,957 --> 00:23:32,106
No, no.

379
00:23:33,157 --> 00:23:37,196
There's a lot of interesting things
I could do with a man like you.

380
00:23:37,477 --> 00:23:40,435
I thought you were crazy before,
but I know you're crazy now.

381
00:23:40,757 --> 00:23:43,669
I'm just a sucker for a naked man.

382
00:23:58,117 --> 00:24:00,073
- When do you start, Cherie?
- June.

383
00:24:00,277 --> 00:24:02,074
I gotta find a place to live.

384
00:24:02,277 --> 00:24:05,314
Oh, I envy you. There are
so many fine men in college.

385
00:24:05,557 --> 00:24:09,232
- Excuse me?
- Not that I care, at all.

386
00:24:10,557 --> 00:24:11,831
Public intimacy?

387
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:14,189
I've never seen him like this.

388
00:24:14,397 --> 00:24:16,865
Girl, you must have kryptonite
in your pu...

389
00:24:18,437 --> 00:24:19,426
Possession.

390
00:24:22,957 --> 00:24:27,155
Hey, my beautiful children.
How you doing, sweetie?

391
00:24:27,717 --> 00:24:30,754
- Where's the rest of your outfit?
- You would be talking to?

392
00:24:30,957 --> 00:24:33,471
To you.
You shouldn't dress like that.

393
00:24:33,677 --> 00:24:36,396
How very Freudian of you.
Now I know I look good.

394
00:24:36,637 --> 00:24:38,673
- You look fine, Ms. Smith.
- Thank you, baby.

395
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:40,310
Yes, you do, Mother.

396
00:24:41,077 --> 00:24:43,989
- I was only 18 when I had Jackson.
- Not this story.

397
00:24:44,237 --> 00:24:46,068
I was nothing but a baby myself.

398
00:24:46,277 --> 00:24:48,871
It took me 10 months and 20 hours
of labour.

399
00:24:49,077 --> 00:24:50,715
He's been nothing but trouble...

400
00:24:50,957 --> 00:24:53,915
Trouble ever since.
Yes, for the 100th time, we know.

401
00:24:54,157 --> 00:24:56,671
It's not about me.
Cherie's starting school.

402
00:24:56,877 --> 00:24:59,789
Did you have your female
conversation about men?

403
00:24:59,997 --> 00:25:02,352
Oops! I'll do it right now. Sorry.

404
00:25:03,077 --> 00:25:04,271
Come here, baby.

405
00:25:04,757 --> 00:25:09,785
Cherie, a man only needs three things.

406
00:25:10,037 --> 00:25:12,676
Well, two of them's money.

407
00:25:14,557 --> 00:25:17,276
That's cute. That's cute.

408
00:25:17,677 --> 00:25:20,874
Denise, you're nicer than the
other women Jackson usually dates.

409
00:25:21,397 --> 00:25:22,796
Mama, please.

410
00:25:23,037 --> 00:25:25,915
Don't fight the truth.
It'll make you grow old fast.

411
00:25:26,157 --> 00:25:27,795
Not that I would know.

412
00:25:28,037 --> 00:25:29,675
I know not to argue with women...

413
00:25:29,917 --> 00:25:33,466
...so I'll go. You guys can talk
about me behind my back.

414
00:25:34,117 --> 00:25:37,189
Ain't nobody talking about you.
We're talking about me.

415
00:25:37,437 --> 00:25:39,667
Damn. Come on, y'all.

416
00:25:40,717 --> 00:25:42,196
Can you believe Jack, Mama?

417
00:25:42,437 --> 00:25:45,076
Asking you to tell me about men
as if there's a secret.

418
00:25:45,317 --> 00:25:46,955
- Well, there is.
- Really?

419
00:25:47,157 --> 00:25:48,795
And I know what it is.

420
00:25:48,997 --> 00:25:52,876
Wait, wait, not that I need to know
or anything, but what is it?

421
00:25:53,077 --> 00:25:55,910
Well, it's really very simple.

422
00:25:56,157 --> 00:26:00,070
There's one sure way to tell
if a man really loves you.

423
00:26:00,477 --> 00:26:01,466
Come here.

424
00:26:02,637 --> 00:26:05,595
When it's late and you're all
hugged up on the sofa...

425
00:26:05,837 --> 00:26:08,397
...and you're eating food
and watching TV...

426
00:26:08,637 --> 00:26:12,073
...and you're just, you're just
all over each other.

427
00:26:13,277 --> 00:26:16,986
Well, if he will give you
his last piece of food...

428
00:26:17,237 --> 00:26:19,114
...the very last bite...

429
00:26:19,357 --> 00:26:22,030
...baby, that's love.

430
00:26:22,237 --> 00:26:23,750
I like that. I like that.

431
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:28,587
Me too. It's got sacrifice,
protection, the sensuality of eating.

432
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:32,876
- I learned that in psych class.
- Well, I learned it the hard way.

433
00:26:33,237 --> 00:26:34,875
Look what the wind blew in.

434
00:26:36,077 --> 00:26:38,875
- Congratulations, baby.
- Thank you, Daddy.

435
00:26:39,237 --> 00:26:41,068
And this is my girl, Denise.

436
00:26:42,757 --> 00:26:45,874
Hi, Denise. Fred Smith.
Glad to meet you.

437
00:26:47,277 --> 00:26:49,268
- Where've you been?
- I'm sorry, baby.

438
00:26:49,477 --> 00:26:51,866
I was busy. I had to make
a few stops before I got here.

439
00:26:52,157 --> 00:26:54,717
You look good, Fred.
Almost as good as me.

440
00:26:55,797 --> 00:26:58,152
Maybe I'll clear the dance floor
and teach you something.

441
00:26:58,357 --> 00:26:59,676
Well, I'll be around.

442
00:27:04,317 --> 00:27:06,069
Everybody, this is my date, Ursula.

443
00:27:17,157 --> 00:27:18,636
Ursula don't speak no English.

444
00:27:20,277 --> 00:27:23,587
Now, we got to do something
about our weak-ass immigration laws.

445
00:27:24,957 --> 00:27:27,676
I need another drink. Excuse me.

446
00:27:35,197 --> 00:27:38,473
So you don't speak no English?

447
00:27:40,437 --> 00:27:43,190
So "stank ho" wouldn't
mean nothing to you?

448
00:27:45,157 --> 00:27:47,273
No, not "stanque hou," "stank ho."

449
00:27:48,117 --> 00:27:50,995
Dead ho. Ignorant ho.
French ho.

450
00:27:51,237 --> 00:27:53,273
Have a good time. Enjoy yourself.

451
00:27:53,837 --> 00:27:56,067
Bringing that bitch up in here.

452
00:28:01,917 --> 00:28:04,875
- This ain't my car.
- Look at it. Look at it!

453
00:28:05,117 --> 00:28:07,267
This is my man's car.
I'm watching it.

454
00:28:07,557 --> 00:28:10,276
Tyrel said you kicked his boys
out, Ma. Why?

455
00:28:10,477 --> 00:28:12,069
I did what I had to do.

456
00:28:12,317 --> 00:28:15,195
He had them fools in my house
drinking and smoking.

457
00:28:15,437 --> 00:28:17,189
And you know that ain't right.

458
00:28:17,397 --> 00:28:19,831
See what I mean? Issues.

459
00:28:20,037 --> 00:28:23,074
Brian, my boys want to steal
your car. I can hook it up.

460
00:28:23,277 --> 00:28:25,871
No insurance scams, T-Boy.
Get out of here!

461
00:28:26,077 --> 00:28:27,510
Don't shoot the messenger.

462
00:28:27,757 --> 00:28:31,909
Tyrel, I want you to tell your
friends that this house is off limits.

463
00:28:32,117 --> 00:28:34,472
- Let's talk about this.
- Ain't nothing to talk about.

464
00:28:34,717 --> 00:28:36,196
That boy is 17 years old.

465
00:28:36,437 --> 00:28:39,395
He had some women
in this house having sex.

466
00:28:39,597 --> 00:28:41,588
Ma, I told you.
We weren't having sex.

467
00:28:41,837 --> 00:28:43,156
We was just watching TV.

468
00:28:43,397 --> 00:28:45,672
- I guess it was raining condoms.
- What condoms?

469
00:28:45,877 --> 00:28:47,754
Maybe two squirrels
was freaking with it.

470
00:28:47,957 --> 00:28:49,913
- Yo, Brian.
- What, motherfucker?!

471
00:28:50,117 --> 00:28:51,994
They gonna give you 40 percent.

472
00:28:52,197 --> 00:28:54,665
Get out of here, man. Can't you see...

473
00:28:54,877 --> 00:28:58,233
I'm sensing some hesitation
on your part. I'll go for 50-50.

474
00:28:59,077 --> 00:29:02,387
- I don't like him outside my house.
- He's watching my car, Mama.

475
00:29:02,637 --> 00:29:06,596
She don't like nobody here except
for them old ladies from church...

476
00:29:06,837 --> 00:29:09,715
...who be coming here smelling
like old cheese and garbage.

477
00:29:09,957 --> 00:29:13,711
Oh, no, you did not say that.
He did not say that. I'm...

478
00:29:13,957 --> 00:29:17,506
Tyrel, just go outside.
Just go outside, all right?

479
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:19,156
Watch my car.

480
00:29:20,477 --> 00:29:23,230
- It's good to see you.
- I don't know how good it is.

481
00:29:23,437 --> 00:29:25,393
- What do you think we should do?
- Nothing.

482
00:29:25,717 --> 00:29:26,945
We won't do anything.

483
00:29:27,237 --> 00:29:29,228
He doesn't have one picture of you.

484
00:29:29,557 --> 00:29:30,956
It's too late for regrets.

485
00:29:31,957 --> 00:29:34,676
You and I can't change
what happened between us.

486
00:29:34,917 --> 00:29:37,067
- I think we should just tell him.
- No.

487
00:29:37,357 --> 00:29:40,076
No, I'll do it.
I'll do it in my own time.

488
00:29:40,357 --> 00:29:41,631
Fine.

489
00:29:42,317 --> 00:29:44,194
You trying to steal my girl?

490
00:29:46,157 --> 00:29:48,466
I'll go before your mama
kills that girl.

491
00:29:48,717 --> 00:29:50,867
I'll take Ursula her drink.
Nice meeting you.

492
00:29:51,077 --> 00:29:52,112
Nice to meet you.

493
00:29:54,357 --> 00:29:55,676
Can I talk to you?

494
00:29:56,117 --> 00:29:57,106
Yeah.

495
00:29:57,517 --> 00:30:00,668
- Why'd you bring another woman over?
- Hey, son.

496
00:30:01,517 --> 00:30:04,873
I have my own life now.
You know what I'm saying?

497
00:30:06,117 --> 00:30:10,076
- What do you think about Denise?
- She seems nice.

498
00:30:10,717 --> 00:30:13,675
- Are you guys serious?
- Yeah, it's going good.

499
00:30:13,917 --> 00:30:16,875
That's good. I'm happy for you.

500
00:30:17,157 --> 00:30:19,910
Mama's gonna be upset
about this for a week.

501
00:30:20,157 --> 00:30:21,670
Come on, son.

502
00:30:21,877 --> 00:30:25,506
Your mother and I are divorced.
She understands that.

503
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:27,634
Yeah, but I still don't get it.

504
00:30:27,837 --> 00:30:31,955
How can two people live and stay
together for 25 years and leave?

505
00:30:32,157 --> 00:30:34,671
You know why your mother
and I split, son.

506
00:30:36,357 --> 00:30:38,268
Terry's getting married.

507
00:30:39,557 --> 00:30:42,469
- Little Terry?
- Yeah, well, he's big Terry now.

508
00:30:43,037 --> 00:30:45,267
That's good news. I'm happy for him.

509
00:30:46,517 --> 00:30:47,711
Come on, now, tell me.

510
00:30:47,957 --> 00:30:49,106
You're not taking that fall?

511
00:30:49,357 --> 00:30:51,154
Oh, hell, no.

512
00:30:52,077 --> 00:30:54,637
No, marriage, it's not for me.

513
00:30:55,117 --> 00:30:58,268
Come on, you can't judge
by looking at me and your mother.

514
00:30:58,517 --> 00:31:01,907
Your mother and I
had some great years together, son.

515
00:31:02,157 --> 00:31:04,591
Who knows, your luck might be
better than mine.

516
00:31:04,837 --> 00:31:07,670
They say talent skips a generation.

517
00:31:08,077 --> 00:31:09,271
I'll remember that.

518
00:31:09,757 --> 00:31:13,306
Hey, why don't you come down
and visit your old man sometimes?

519
00:31:13,557 --> 00:31:15,229
I'm always at the dealerships.

520
00:31:16,237 --> 00:31:17,306
Yeah, I'll do that.

521
00:31:17,517 --> 00:31:18,791
I'm looking forward to it.

522
00:31:19,037 --> 00:31:21,505
- Hey, baby.
- Dad, where is it?

523
00:31:21,757 --> 00:31:22,792
In the driveway.

524
00:31:23,037 --> 00:31:25,631
- Come on, let's go.
- Come on, check this out.

525
00:31:29,357 --> 00:31:30,870
Daddy!

526
00:31:33,557 --> 00:31:35,468
You guys, get in, get in.

527
00:31:36,557 --> 00:31:39,674
Whoa, back it up, man. Back it up.

528
00:31:40,557 --> 00:31:42,673
I don't want to see you around here.

529
00:31:45,557 --> 00:31:47,707
I don't want any boys in here.
Understand?

530
00:31:48,877 --> 00:31:52,267
Stay on the main street,
don't drive down to the hood.

531
00:31:52,477 --> 00:31:54,593
- Okay.
- I worry about you.

532
00:31:57,077 --> 00:31:58,829
Mama, let Tyrel come live with me.

533
00:31:59,037 --> 00:32:00,106
No.

534
00:32:00,357 --> 00:32:02,109
I told you, I'm not letting him go.

535
00:32:02,317 --> 00:32:05,150
- Why not? He's my brother.
- Half-brother.

536
00:32:05,717 --> 00:32:08,595
All I'm saying is that the boy
is not happy here.

537
00:32:08,797 --> 00:32:10,594
It not like his daddy's around.

538
00:32:10,837 --> 00:32:13,271
Don't even bring up that fool to me.

539
00:32:14,037 --> 00:32:15,595
Left me for some white woman.

540
00:32:15,957 --> 00:32:18,266
- Hawaiian.
- Lf she ain't black, she's white.

541
00:32:18,517 --> 00:32:20,826
That's what I mean.
That's ridiculous.

542
00:32:21,037 --> 00:32:22,516
Fact of life.

543
00:32:22,717 --> 00:32:23,945
That's crazy! Latino women?

544
00:32:24,157 --> 00:32:25,510
A white woman with a taco.

545
00:32:25,717 --> 00:32:27,230
Oh, so I guess Asian women...

546
00:32:27,437 --> 00:32:30,509
A white woman who
"no speak the goddamn English."

547
00:32:31,957 --> 00:32:36,348
You know what? The both of you are
just like your daddies, full of it.

548
00:32:36,557 --> 00:32:37,876
I heard that my whole life.

549
00:32:38,077 --> 00:32:39,988
How long will you see them in us?

550
00:32:40,677 --> 00:32:43,794
What they did is wrong,
but me and Tyrel, we didn't do it.

551
00:32:44,157 --> 00:32:45,306
Can we get a little love?

552
00:32:45,517 --> 00:32:46,870
I raised you.

553
00:32:47,117 --> 00:32:48,106
That's love.

554
00:32:48,317 --> 00:32:49,716
Oh, really.

555
00:32:49,957 --> 00:32:51,868
Then, prove it, Mama.

556
00:32:52,917 --> 00:32:55,590
Can you give your son
a kiss and a hug?

557
00:32:58,837 --> 00:33:00,668
You too old for that now.

558
00:33:02,917 --> 00:33:04,475
You can't do it...

559
00:33:04,717 --> 00:33:05,706
...can you?

560
00:33:05,957 --> 00:33:08,107
You're acting crazy, just stop it.

561
00:33:08,357 --> 00:33:11,076
Mama, when was the last time
you gave me a hug?

562
00:33:11,277 --> 00:33:13,108
What was it? 10 years ago?

563
00:33:13,357 --> 00:33:15,268
Right after Tyrel's father left?

564
00:33:15,517 --> 00:33:18,315
Mama, 10 years is a long time.

565
00:33:18,557 --> 00:33:20,991
Come on, Mama, I'm waiting.

566
00:33:21,237 --> 00:33:23,273
Give me love, Mama.

567
00:33:23,877 --> 00:33:26,675
Get out of my house
with this nonsense.

568
00:33:32,117 --> 00:33:33,869
When Tyrel gets old enough, Mama...

569
00:33:34,117 --> 00:33:36,790
...he's gonna come live
with his big brother.

570
00:33:37,037 --> 00:33:38,265
He can get love from me.

571
00:33:39,797 --> 00:33:40,786
You can believe that.

572
00:34:09,957 --> 00:34:12,915
Mama?
Hey, now, how are you doing?

573
00:34:13,477 --> 00:34:15,672
Oh, hey, son.

574
00:34:17,517 --> 00:34:19,508
Look how pretty you look today.

575
00:34:19,757 --> 00:34:22,066
I don't look dead.
That's all I care about.

576
00:34:22,317 --> 00:34:24,512
Come on, Mama,
don't say stuff like that.

577
00:34:24,757 --> 00:34:25,906
You gonna live forever.

578
00:34:26,117 --> 00:34:27,869
What are you talking about, Derrick?

579
00:34:28,277 --> 00:34:29,471
Everybody dies.

580
00:34:29,717 --> 00:34:31,787
I drank too much when I carried you.

581
00:34:33,477 --> 00:34:35,433
You drank when you were pregnant?

582
00:34:35,917 --> 00:34:40,672
Well, yeah. It's not like I was
operating heavy machinery or nothing.

583
00:34:43,757 --> 00:34:44,872
Look...

584
00:34:45,717 --> 00:34:46,866
...Mama...

585
00:34:47,837 --> 00:34:49,429
...I want you to come live with
me and my family.

586
00:34:50,077 --> 00:34:51,192
When did you get married?

587
00:34:51,717 --> 00:34:54,151
Three years ago.
You were there, remember?

588
00:34:55,837 --> 00:34:58,954
Yeah, that's right. We ate chicken.

589
00:34:59,157 --> 00:35:00,670
Yes, we did.

590
00:35:00,917 --> 00:35:02,270
How's my grandbaby?

591
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:04,667
Janel? Oh, Janel is wonderful.

592
00:35:06,957 --> 00:35:08,948
Hey, James and Amber and I...

593
00:35:10,237 --> 00:35:13,195
James and Amber,
those are your other children.

594
00:35:13,437 --> 00:35:15,712
I know who they are!

595
00:35:15,917 --> 00:35:18,909
Boy, are you high or something?

596
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,550
No, ma'am, no.

597
00:35:21,037 --> 00:35:23,870
Look, we just don't think
you belong here anymore.

598
00:35:24,117 --> 00:35:25,106
I like it here.

599
00:35:25,317 --> 00:35:27,956
I know, Mama, but I miss you.
And you know what?

600
00:35:28,197 --> 00:35:30,995
Janel, she'd love having
her grandmother around.

601
00:35:32,957 --> 00:35:35,391
- And your wife?
- I'm working on that.

602
00:35:35,597 --> 00:35:37,269
I'll bet you are.

603
00:35:37,517 --> 00:35:39,075
- We don't like each other.
- Mama...

604
00:35:39,517 --> 00:35:41,269
Evil witch.

605
00:35:42,117 --> 00:35:44,347
No, I think I'm gonna stay right here.

606
00:35:44,717 --> 00:35:47,515
That was fine when you and Daddy
were here together.

607
00:35:47,717 --> 00:35:50,072
But now, Daddy's gone, and when you...

608
00:35:50,957 --> 00:35:52,788
Mama, I'm sorry.

609
00:35:54,477 --> 00:35:58,072
Yeah, things were a lot different
when your father was alive.

610
00:35:59,477 --> 00:36:02,116
Hey, look, I am supposed
to be taking you to lunch.

611
00:36:02,357 --> 00:36:05,793
You come over here
with your fine brown frame.

612
00:36:06,757 --> 00:36:08,509
I know you run numbers out of here.

613
00:36:08,757 --> 00:36:09,746
This ain't fooling nobody.

614
00:36:09,997 --> 00:36:12,067
- Come on.
- Who's collecting my money?

615
00:36:13,157 --> 00:36:15,307
No idea who flattened your car tires?

616
00:36:15,517 --> 00:36:17,269
No, and you know,
it could be anybody.

617
00:36:17,517 --> 00:36:18,870
Lawyers make a lot of enemies.

618
00:36:19,117 --> 00:36:22,189
I bet it was a woman.
That's how we get back at men.

619
00:36:22,397 --> 00:36:24,547
A car is just
a big old dick with wheels.

620
00:36:26,357 --> 00:36:27,756
Counsellor?

621
00:36:28,597 --> 00:36:31,270
Hi, judge. I'm having my lunch here.

622
00:36:31,517 --> 00:36:35,351
You filed a motion to have me
permanently barred from your cases.

623
00:36:35,557 --> 00:36:39,266
Yes, and I think you'd agree
I'm right, after what happened.

624
00:36:41,037 --> 00:36:43,505
Hi, I'm Judge Carla Williams.

625
00:36:43,757 --> 00:36:44,792
Hi. I'm Jesse.

626
00:36:46,117 --> 00:36:47,106
Are you a lawyer too?

627
00:36:47,917 --> 00:36:51,148
No, I'm sort of a teacher.

628
00:36:51,957 --> 00:36:53,390
Teacher.

629
00:36:53,637 --> 00:36:55,593
What's the pay these days
for teachers?

630
00:36:55,837 --> 00:36:58,226
Carla, there is no reason for this.

631
00:36:58,477 --> 00:37:02,390
- Right, sorry. Have a nice lunch.
- Thank you.

632
00:37:04,117 --> 00:37:05,675
- What's her problem?
- No idea.

633
00:37:07,517 --> 00:37:09,633
Excuse me, what did you say?

634
00:37:09,837 --> 00:37:11,634
Carla, why are you making a scene?

635
00:37:11,837 --> 00:37:16,194
I'm not making a scene.
I'm merely having girl talk.

636
00:37:17,717 --> 00:37:18,911
Now, what did you say?

637
00:37:21,077 --> 00:37:23,511
- I said...
- Oh, shit.

638
00:37:23,757 --> 00:37:25,827
...what's your problem?

639
00:37:26,037 --> 00:37:29,234
My problem is tired-ass men
like this.

640
00:37:29,437 --> 00:37:31,075
And women who get the world...

641
00:37:31,317 --> 00:37:33,990
...given to them,
but you have to have our men too.

642
00:37:35,317 --> 00:37:38,150
- Get that finger out of my face.
- Or else what?

643
00:37:38,357 --> 00:37:40,348
What are you gonna do?

644
00:37:40,557 --> 00:37:42,070
What're you gonna do?

645
00:37:45,357 --> 00:37:48,269
- Damn!
- What is going on?

646
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:51,674
Bro, take Buffy the Negro Slayer
and get out of my spot!

647
00:37:51,917 --> 00:37:53,270
I was just trying...

648
00:37:54,437 --> 00:37:56,667
Come on, Jesse. Let's just go.

649
00:37:57,877 --> 00:38:00,186
I can't believe you.
Just get in the car.

650
00:38:00,437 --> 00:38:01,313
Why are you mad at me?

651
00:38:01,557 --> 00:38:03,434
You just assaulted a judge, Jesse.

652
00:38:03,637 --> 00:38:06,709
She curses us both out,
jabs her finger into my face...

653
00:38:06,957 --> 00:38:08,026
...and you yell at me?

654
00:38:08,237 --> 00:38:10,797
You had no right to hit her.
That was childish.

655
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:14,273
I got a reputation,
and you made me look stupid in there.

656
00:38:14,517 --> 00:38:15,632
You ain't no different.

657
00:38:17,637 --> 00:38:21,869
- What do you mean, "different"?
- Nothing, let's just go.

658
00:38:22,317 --> 00:38:24,751
You thought I'd be different
because I'm white?

659
00:38:25,477 --> 00:38:26,990
- Didn't say that.
- You know what?

660
00:38:27,197 --> 00:38:29,427
You are a self-centred,
arrogant fool.

661
00:38:29,637 --> 00:38:30,865
Let me tell you something...

662
00:38:31,077 --> 00:38:32,829
...women have one thing in common:

663
00:38:33,357 --> 00:38:36,713
We don't like bullshit men.
And that's you, the bullshit man.

664
00:38:36,917 --> 00:38:37,906
Get out of my face.

665
00:38:38,117 --> 00:38:39,311
Hey, you want some too?

666
00:38:39,557 --> 00:38:41,946
I got one ass-kicking left
with your name.

667
00:38:42,197 --> 00:38:45,473
I don't have time. I don't
need the drama, Miss Jackie Chan.

668
00:38:45,677 --> 00:38:47,588
I'll kick your ass
in this parking lot.

669
00:38:47,797 --> 00:38:50,789
This white girl's got something
for you. Come get it.

670
00:39:29,837 --> 00:39:31,270
<i>- Hello?
- Hey.</i>

671
00:39:31,477 --> 00:39:33,672
<i>Hey, baby, you still working?</i>

672
00:39:34,917 --> 00:39:37,067
No, no, I'm not at work.

673
00:39:38,717 --> 00:39:40,070
Listen...

674
00:39:40,557 --> 00:39:42,036
...why don't you come over?

675
00:39:44,477 --> 00:39:46,069
Derrick.

676
00:39:47,077 --> 00:39:48,430
Derrick.

677
00:39:48,917 --> 00:39:51,306
We have been mad at each other
for too long.

678
00:39:51,557 --> 00:39:56,585
It's time for some serious making up.
Yeah.

679
00:39:57,357 --> 00:39:59,871
Hi.

680
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:46,796
Derrick.

681
00:40:48,477 --> 00:40:52,868
Come on, baby. I'm really
gonna give it to you this time.

682
00:40:53,637 --> 00:40:55,309
Give me what, Sheila?

683
00:40:55,557 --> 00:40:56,990
Oh, well...

684
00:40:57,237 --> 00:40:59,387
...first, let's do it
the regular way...

685
00:40:59,637 --> 00:41:02,868
- Oh, no, not interested.
- We can talk about...

686
00:41:03,917 --> 00:41:06,875
What the hell is this?
You haven't touched me for weeks!

687
00:41:07,117 --> 00:41:08,596
Because I'm tired.

688
00:41:08,837 --> 00:41:09,986
I don't believe this shit.

689
00:41:10,197 --> 00:41:13,109
Is that what's important?
Somebody going down on you?

690
00:41:13,317 --> 00:41:15,592
You just don't get it, do you?

691
00:41:16,637 --> 00:41:18,912
We are married.
This is not just about sex.

692
00:41:19,157 --> 00:41:21,307
It's about how we feel
about each other.

693
00:41:21,557 --> 00:41:23,787
You mean everything to me.
What do I mean to you?

694
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:29,032
No, this is about sex.
See, that's all you men care about.

695
00:41:29,357 --> 00:41:34,272
No, this is about the way I've let you
control this relationship and family.

696
00:41:34,517 --> 00:41:37,190
That's over now.
My mama's coming to live with us.

697
00:41:37,397 --> 00:41:38,386
No, she's not!

698
00:41:38,597 --> 00:41:40,508
I told them
I am terminating her lease.

699
00:41:40,757 --> 00:41:42,554
She's coming as soon as I can get her.

700
00:41:42,757 --> 00:41:44,873
You didn't consult with me.
I didn't agree.

701
00:41:45,117 --> 00:41:47,551
I didn't have to.
I consulted my damn self.

702
00:41:47,757 --> 00:41:49,076
You are doing this to spite me...

703
00:41:49,277 --> 00:41:51,472
...because I won't give you
the sex you want.

704
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:54,470
You are nothing but
a nasty, freaky freak...

705
00:41:54,717 --> 00:41:57,709
You know, I married you
because you were pregnant...

706
00:41:57,957 --> 00:42:00,073
...and I never
questioned your motives.

707
00:42:00,677 --> 00:42:02,713
We agreed it was the best thing to do.

708
00:42:02,917 --> 00:42:05,670
Oh, did we?
Or did you come to me crying, saying:

709
00:42:06,557 --> 00:42:09,594
"My life is over.
What are we gonna do?"

710
00:42:10,757 --> 00:42:14,636
Are you trying to say I got
pregnant intentionally to hook you?

711
00:42:14,837 --> 00:42:18,910
What I am saying is that my mama
is coming to live with us.

712
00:42:19,157 --> 00:42:20,226
Get used to it.

713
00:42:21,317 --> 00:42:23,467
You hit me, it'll take
NATO Peacekeepers...

714
00:42:23,677 --> 00:42:25,110
...to pull my foot out your ass.

715
00:42:30,157 --> 00:42:32,068
Fine, Derrick.

716
00:42:32,877 --> 00:42:35,675
Do we have any more triple-A batteries?

717
00:42:35,877 --> 00:42:38,994
I think I used them all
the last time this happened.

718
00:42:39,197 --> 00:42:42,075
Don't play, woman.
I quit school because of recess!

719
00:42:43,837 --> 00:42:46,874
My cousin says his place in Florida
is empty next month.

720
00:42:47,077 --> 00:42:48,874
You trying to shack up with me?

721
00:42:49,077 --> 00:42:52,149
Oh, hell, yes. Then we can do it
all over South Beach.

722
00:42:52,357 --> 00:42:56,066
We can christen every single pier.

723
00:42:57,837 --> 00:43:00,397
Jack, there's something
that's been on my mind.

724
00:43:00,637 --> 00:43:02,514
Something I need to tell you.

725
00:43:02,717 --> 00:43:03,991
What?

726
00:43:08,357 --> 00:43:09,949
I don't even know how to start.

727
00:43:10,157 --> 00:43:13,672
Let me help you this time.
There's something I want to tell you.

728
00:43:14,237 --> 00:43:17,309
- Remember telling me about pictures?
- I remember.

729
00:43:18,037 --> 00:43:20,426
At first I didn't understand
what you meant.

730
00:43:21,237 --> 00:43:23,512
But I understand now, what you meant.

731
00:43:24,117 --> 00:43:27,792
How a person can make a turning point
to where it changes everything.

732
00:43:29,077 --> 00:43:31,466
And I've changed like that, Denise.

733
00:43:32,877 --> 00:43:35,869
I've changed like that because of you.

734
00:43:36,277 --> 00:43:39,713
I want you to know, Denise,
I'm not afraid of a good woman...

735
00:43:39,957 --> 00:43:42,266
...and all that she can
bring to a man.

736
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:45,676
And I'm not afraid to tell you
I love you, Denise.

737
00:44:01,277 --> 00:44:05,668
Now, did that make it a little easier
to say what you wanted to say?

738
00:44:06,517 --> 00:44:07,666
Yeah.

739
00:44:09,157 --> 00:44:11,068
It did. Actually, it's...

740
00:44:11,557 --> 00:44:13,673
...not even important anymore.

741
00:44:15,917 --> 00:44:17,430
I love you too, Jackson.

742
00:44:18,117 --> 00:44:19,470
Good.

743
00:44:22,037 --> 00:44:23,470
Really good.

744
00:44:29,317 --> 00:44:30,306
You gonna eat that?

745
00:44:34,437 --> 00:44:35,665
Yeah.

746
00:44:37,357 --> 00:44:39,154
This shit right here, it's blazing.

747
00:44:40,037 --> 00:44:42,471
The spices and shit was just right.

748
00:44:47,757 --> 00:44:48,872
Hi, baby.

749
00:44:48,957 --> 00:44:48,997
Louise, thank you for
letting me have my shower here.

750
00:44:48,997 --> 00:44:51,795
Louise, thank you for
letting me have my shower here.

751
00:44:52,157 --> 00:44:53,670
Terry's mother loved it.

752
00:44:53,877 --> 00:44:56,755
No problem. Freddie throws
Terry's bachelor party...

753
00:44:56,957 --> 00:44:59,471
...and I'm not about to be outdone.

754
00:45:01,757 --> 00:45:02,872
Hey.

755
00:45:03,717 --> 00:45:05,275
Denise, you okay?

756
00:45:07,077 --> 00:45:08,669
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

757
00:45:09,397 --> 00:45:12,707
I was thinking, Jackson has been
saying the right things...

758
00:45:12,957 --> 00:45:14,310
...but I don't know if he means it.

759
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:15,792
Why do you say that?

760
00:45:17,277 --> 00:45:18,426
He told me that he loved me.

761
00:45:19,437 --> 00:45:22,907
- Sweet!
- And he ate the last chicken piece.

762
00:45:23,157 --> 00:45:25,068
- Stop.
- Not good. Not good.

763
00:45:25,277 --> 00:45:28,314
I can get Terry to talk to him,
find out what he thinks.

764
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:30,348
He's got his head on straight.

765
00:45:30,637 --> 00:45:32,912
Yes, Terry's gonna make
a fine husband.

766
00:45:33,117 --> 00:45:35,392
You know the brothers
are not going for that.

767
00:45:35,637 --> 00:45:37,867
I was probably overreacting.
It happens.

768
00:45:38,357 --> 00:45:40,075
Maybe Jackson was just hungry.

769
00:45:40,317 --> 00:45:42,626
Not likely, baby.
It's a subconscious thing.

770
00:45:43,037 --> 00:45:45,631
Why do we always pay
for men's emotional failures?

771
00:45:46,117 --> 00:45:48,073
We do do that. We do.

772
00:45:48,317 --> 00:45:49,306
Don't we?

773
00:45:49,517 --> 00:45:50,950
- I know one reason.
- What?

774
00:45:51,757 --> 00:45:54,430
Damn, if we gonna get deep,
let's sit down.

775
00:45:54,637 --> 00:45:55,911
Bring the strawberries.

776
00:45:56,117 --> 00:45:58,267
- I need to learn this.
- Grab that champagne.

777
00:45:58,517 --> 00:45:59,870
All right.

778
00:46:02,437 --> 00:46:06,316
Denise, I love my brother
but if he gives you mixed messages...

779
00:46:06,517 --> 00:46:08,109
...tell him to get his shit together.

780
00:46:08,317 --> 00:46:10,273
That was my baby that said that.

781
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:13,589
Right. That's what I do to Derrick.
That's why we're happy.

782
00:46:13,797 --> 00:46:16,470
- You gotta stand up to him.
- Oh, I know. I know.

783
00:46:16,717 --> 00:46:18,309
Jackson is a good man,
I give him that.

784
00:46:19,037 --> 00:46:23,508
But I have worked too hard to shape
him into the man I've grown to love.

785
00:46:23,757 --> 00:46:25,748
And I'm not doing that shit again.

786
00:46:25,957 --> 00:46:27,675
I'm not limiting myself to brothers.

787
00:46:27,877 --> 00:46:30,311
I'll consider all men,
even those who aren't black.

788
00:46:30,517 --> 00:46:31,996
Like hell you will!

789
00:46:32,197 --> 00:46:34,665
- But, Mama...
- Who taught you that?

790
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:35,952
Life!

791
00:46:36,157 --> 00:46:38,193
Brothers date all kinds of women.

792
00:46:38,637 --> 00:46:42,391
Why should we wait for them
to bestow their favours upon us?

793
00:46:42,637 --> 00:46:46,596
Screw that. A white man has all
the equipment and twice the cash.

794
00:46:46,837 --> 00:46:48,475
Okay, I heard you.

795
00:46:49,357 --> 00:46:51,507
Oh, I wouldn't know
anything about that.

796
00:46:51,717 --> 00:46:54,709
While we're on the subject
of other men, Mama...

797
00:46:54,917 --> 00:46:57,431
...you need a man.
Stop pining away for Daddy.

798
00:46:58,357 --> 00:47:01,394
Okay, that's enough,
you've been drinking too much.

799
00:47:02,357 --> 00:47:03,676
This is a new century.

800
00:47:03,917 --> 00:47:06,431
Women are saying goodbye
to dependency.

801
00:47:06,637 --> 00:47:09,151
I don't need a man. I have myself.

802
00:47:11,357 --> 00:47:15,236
I wasn't sure till this very second,
but my baby's still a virgin.

803
00:47:17,677 --> 00:47:20,908
You know what you have to do?
You need to reject your pussy.

804
00:47:21,717 --> 00:47:23,275
- Oh, my God!
- No, she didn't.

805
00:47:24,117 --> 00:47:26,426
That's a little bit
too much me in you.

806
00:47:26,637 --> 00:47:27,672
Now, sit down somewhere.

807
00:47:27,917 --> 00:47:32,035
That word was created by men in order
to objectify women's sexuality...

808
00:47:32,237 --> 00:47:33,989
...and turn us into property.

809
00:47:34,197 --> 00:47:36,233
If you accept that you have one,
they own you.

810
00:47:37,157 --> 00:47:39,148
I don't. I reject my pussy.

811
00:47:40,517 --> 00:47:41,506
She said the "P" word.

812
00:47:41,717 --> 00:47:42,786
If that's the case...

813
00:47:43,037 --> 00:47:46,552
...why don't you give me yours
because I could use an extra one.

814
00:47:47,117 --> 00:47:50,314
Fine. But you know what?
Don't say I didn't try to educate you.

815
00:47:50,517 --> 00:47:52,394
No, we hear you, Cherie.

816
00:47:52,597 --> 00:47:57,432
Denise, I think you need to sit down
and really tell him how you feel.

817
00:47:57,637 --> 00:47:59,275
The direct approach is the best one.

818
00:47:59,477 --> 00:48:00,876
I'm not trying to scare him...

819
00:48:01,077 --> 00:48:05,548
...and you know I have a tendency
to come across a little strong.

820
00:48:05,757 --> 00:48:08,476
A woman is strength.

821
00:48:08,717 --> 00:48:11,595
Not just the giver of life
and all that, but more.

822
00:48:12,437 --> 00:48:15,907
Men don't even know who they are
until they find the right woman.

823
00:48:16,157 --> 00:48:18,717
Or, for that matter,
if they even want a woman.

824
00:48:19,957 --> 00:48:23,154
But whatever he chooses,
it starts with us.

825
00:48:25,557 --> 00:48:27,946
So be fearless with my son.

826
00:48:28,157 --> 00:48:33,356
Don't be timid with love,
because we invented the shit.

827
00:48:33,637 --> 00:48:35,787
- All right.
- Thank you. Now...

828
00:48:36,517 --> 00:48:38,473
...ladies, to the sisters.

829
00:48:39,037 --> 00:48:41,790
- To the sisters!
- Yes!

830
00:48:41,997 --> 00:48:46,275
Miracles and blessings, ladies.
Miracles and blessings.

831
00:48:50,117 --> 00:48:52,312
Okay, don't wait up, Mama.

832
00:48:52,557 --> 00:48:53,876
Bye-bye.

833
00:48:55,677 --> 00:48:57,713
Louise, can I ask you something?

834
00:48:57,957 --> 00:48:59,390
More about Jackson?

835
00:48:59,637 --> 00:49:01,867
No, this is about me.

836
00:49:03,277 --> 00:49:05,268
Okay, come on.

837
00:49:47,357 --> 00:49:49,313
Well, well, the husband-to-be.

838
00:49:49,557 --> 00:49:50,626
Yes, yes, yes.

839
00:49:50,837 --> 00:49:53,067
Why are you sitting here
by yourself?

840
00:49:53,317 --> 00:49:54,636
- Drinking.
- I can see, but...

841
00:49:54,837 --> 00:49:58,512
...you need to come by the pool.
As you see, here is a boob.

842
00:49:58,717 --> 00:49:59,706
I need to talk to you.

843
00:49:59,917 --> 00:50:00,986
Bro, what's up?

844
00:50:01,237 --> 00:50:03,148
Without her. Excuse me?

845
00:50:04,637 --> 00:50:08,073
All right, don't you go too far
with my two little friends.

846
00:50:09,437 --> 00:50:11,109
Did you see? She can breathe.

847
00:50:12,837 --> 00:50:14,395
So, what's up, B? Speak.

848
00:50:15,077 --> 00:50:16,112
Why are you doing this?

849
00:50:16,517 --> 00:50:18,747
How many times
we got to talk about this?

850
00:50:18,957 --> 00:50:21,915
I told you, because I think
it's about time I grew up.

851
00:50:22,117 --> 00:50:24,392
Don't do it. Don't do it, Terry.

852
00:50:24,597 --> 00:50:27,316
The brothers, we got
a friendship, a bond!

853
00:50:27,557 --> 00:50:31,391
And you, under the guise of growing
up, are about to throw it away.

854
00:50:31,597 --> 00:50:34,907
And I'm looking out for us.
I'm protecting the brothers.

855
00:50:38,157 --> 00:50:39,476
You know what your problem is?

856
00:50:39,717 --> 00:50:42,356
You never could hold liquor,
and you talk too much.

857
00:50:43,037 --> 00:50:44,265
You want to look out for me?

858
00:50:45,717 --> 00:50:47,867
Put the drink down and bring your...

859
00:50:48,117 --> 00:50:50,233
...ass. And let's go look
at some titties.

860
00:50:50,437 --> 00:50:55,591
All right, man. When it all blows up
in your face, don't come calling me.

861
00:50:55,797 --> 00:50:57,674
I don't want to hear about it.

862
00:50:58,557 --> 00:50:59,876
Hey, baby.

863
00:51:01,957 --> 00:51:03,310
All right, that's enough.

864
00:51:03,557 --> 00:51:06,071
You're my boy and I love you,
but this is real.

865
00:51:06,317 --> 00:51:08,990
You jealous, man.
Yeah, you jealous.

866
00:51:09,197 --> 00:51:11,267
You wish you had
somebody to care about.

867
00:51:11,517 --> 00:51:13,030
Don't try to tell me different.

868
00:51:13,237 --> 00:51:17,230
I'll tell you what I discovered.
It's why I'm doing what I'm doing.

869
00:51:17,477 --> 00:51:21,595
This world is full of women waiting
for guys like us who got it together.

870
00:51:22,117 --> 00:51:24,187
But it takes courage
to step up like that.

871
00:51:24,397 --> 00:51:25,796
Courage.

872
00:51:26,197 --> 00:51:28,665
Look at you.
You don't know nothing about that.

873
00:51:28,877 --> 00:51:31,186
You can't seem
to see past your raggedy dick.

874
00:51:33,157 --> 00:51:34,829
Maybe for you this is all there is.

875
00:51:36,117 --> 00:51:40,110
Oh, goddamn. If that's the truth,
then I feel even worse for you.

876
00:51:44,157 --> 00:51:46,910
You drunk. There's a party
going on here for me.

877
00:51:47,157 --> 00:51:49,876
Half-butt-naked women
running all over the place.

878
00:51:50,077 --> 00:51:52,466
I'm trying to enjoy myself. I'm out.

879
00:51:54,077 --> 00:51:56,671
My dick is not raggedy!

880
00:51:57,837 --> 00:51:59,065
It's big.

881
00:52:00,357 --> 00:52:03,588
Don't be shy.
I'm very flattered that you picked me.

882
00:52:03,837 --> 00:52:06,476
Some nice-looking women out there.

883
00:52:07,317 --> 00:52:08,955
I just wanted to...

884
00:52:09,197 --> 00:52:10,186
...you know?

885
00:52:10,757 --> 00:52:13,191
Yeah, I know. What kind do you want?

886
00:52:13,877 --> 00:52:14,866
I do everything.

887
00:52:15,117 --> 00:52:17,426
Everything, what a wonderful word.

888
00:52:17,677 --> 00:52:19,827
I can get a friend if you
want to have fun.

889
00:52:20,437 --> 00:52:22,473
No, no, that...

890
00:52:22,717 --> 00:52:24,116
That won't be necessary.

891
00:52:24,357 --> 00:52:25,870
You know what?
How about some head?

892
00:52:27,717 --> 00:52:30,072
I guess you do know what you want.

893
00:52:30,317 --> 00:52:33,514
Yeah. It ain't for me, it's for him.
He only got one eye.

894
00:52:34,357 --> 00:52:36,917
Oh, Lord, he give me
such trouble sometimes.

895
00:52:37,157 --> 00:52:40,467
Be careful now. He kind of
swell up when you make him mad...

896
00:52:40,717 --> 00:52:41,866
...poke you in the forehead.

897
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:46,076
Hard to work with a dick scuff mark
on your head, so you be cool.

898
00:52:48,237 --> 00:52:50,876
You know, wait. Wait.

899
00:52:55,357 --> 00:52:57,712
You changed your mind?
Something different?

900
00:52:57,957 --> 00:52:58,992
Oh, no, no.

901
00:52:59,197 --> 00:53:01,267
Look, I can't do this.

902
00:53:01,517 --> 00:53:03,109
You're a beautiful girl...

903
00:53:03,357 --> 00:53:06,588
...but I'm here with you
and all I'm thinking is that...

904
00:53:06,837 --> 00:53:08,668
...I wish you were my wife.

905
00:53:12,157 --> 00:53:16,469
A man can't make his dick do
what his heart can't handle.

906
00:53:16,677 --> 00:53:19,271
That is very profound.

907
00:53:19,957 --> 00:53:21,026
That'll be $50.

908
00:53:21,237 --> 00:53:25,674
Fifty dollars for almost doing
something? You must be a Republican.

909
00:53:28,957 --> 00:53:31,790
- I like your style.
- Thanks.

910
00:53:39,277 --> 00:53:40,266
Oh, shut up.

911
00:53:42,277 --> 00:53:44,472
Whoa! Wait.

912
00:53:46,637 --> 00:53:48,309
What's up, D? Did you do it?

913
00:53:49,357 --> 00:53:51,313
No, I couldn't do it.

914
00:53:51,557 --> 00:53:53,070
Couldn't do what?

915
00:53:53,557 --> 00:53:55,388
Nothing.
I'll go hang out in front.

916
00:53:55,637 --> 00:54:00,267
Tell me he couldn't do it with
that thing that walked out of here.

917
00:54:02,837 --> 00:54:04,714
This is what I'm talking about.

918
00:54:04,957 --> 00:54:07,471
This is nice of your dad
to let us use his place.

919
00:54:07,677 --> 00:54:11,590
A party man after my own heart.

920
00:54:11,837 --> 00:54:13,316
Damn, he's still freaky, huh?

921
00:54:13,557 --> 00:54:16,708
He got the women for the party too.
Dirty old bastard.

922
00:54:16,957 --> 00:54:19,710
Did your girl get on your case
about coming here?

923
00:54:19,957 --> 00:54:21,390
Brian, you know I haven't...

924
00:54:21,637 --> 00:54:22,513
Don't lie to me.

925
00:54:22,757 --> 00:54:24,270
I ain't talk about it.

926
00:54:27,517 --> 00:54:29,951
I will beat your drunk ass, man.
This is Italian.

927
00:54:30,157 --> 00:54:31,670
I've had a little bit to drink...

928
00:54:31,917 --> 00:54:33,191
Bro, you're drunk!

929
00:54:33,437 --> 00:54:35,792
Hey, I'm nice. I'm nice.

930
00:54:35,997 --> 00:54:37,191
I've been thinking.

931
00:54:37,397 --> 00:54:39,149
- What about this one?
- That's good.

932
00:54:39,357 --> 00:54:42,315
If we didn't need sex,
we really wouldn't want women.

933
00:54:42,557 --> 00:54:43,785
You got issues, you know?

934
00:54:43,997 --> 00:54:47,876
You just gotta think about it.
Just think about what I'm saying.

935
00:54:48,117 --> 00:54:50,312
You have to stop
this cynical attitude.

936
00:54:50,557 --> 00:54:52,912
I mean, look at me.
I was a lost cause, man.

937
00:54:53,157 --> 00:54:56,194
I was having nightmares
and shit about commitment.

938
00:54:56,757 --> 00:54:58,509
Denise turned my life around.

939
00:54:58,717 --> 00:55:00,275
No, she turned your ass out.

940
00:55:00,517 --> 00:55:03,475
Hey, call it what you like,
but I'm happy.

941
00:55:04,357 --> 00:55:05,346
What about you, Brian?

942
00:55:06,637 --> 00:55:08,673
I'm drinking, man. I'm cool.

943
00:55:09,357 --> 00:55:10,676
I want to have fun here.

944
00:55:10,917 --> 00:55:13,829
We've only been here a few hours,
know what I mean?

945
00:55:14,077 --> 00:55:16,272
I'll meet you downstairs.

946
00:55:22,157 --> 00:55:25,866
<i>Hey, this is Fred. State your case.</i>

947
00:55:26,277 --> 00:55:28,268
<i>Hi, Fred, it's Denise.</i>

948
00:55:28,517 --> 00:55:32,669
<i>Thanks for being understanding.
I've decided to tell Jackson about us.</i>

949
00:55:32,877 --> 00:55:35,675
<i>Call me when you get this message.
Bye.</i>

950
00:55:40,077 --> 00:55:41,305
Hey, baby.

951
00:55:41,557 --> 00:55:44,117
I was hungry. I thought we
could get something...

952
00:55:44,357 --> 00:55:47,349
I heard the message
you left at my father's place.

953
00:55:49,997 --> 00:55:53,034
- Jackson, I was gonna tell you.
- You were gonna tell me?

954
00:55:53,277 --> 00:55:54,756
When were you gonna tell me?

955
00:55:55,557 --> 00:55:56,672
On our honeymoon?

956
00:55:56,877 --> 00:55:58,868
What about Father's Day?
That sound right?

957
00:55:59,077 --> 00:56:01,910
- Let me explain.
- No need, I know why it happened.

958
00:56:03,117 --> 00:56:07,349
It happened because you're a woman
with no discretion about herself...

959
00:56:07,597 --> 00:56:10,316
...personally, emotionally,
and sexually.

960
00:56:10,517 --> 00:56:13,748
- Did you just call me a ho?
- I did not say that word.

961
00:56:13,997 --> 00:56:16,670
But it does seem to be floating
around somewhere.

962
00:56:17,157 --> 00:56:17,953
Okay.

963
00:56:18,197 --> 00:56:21,234
Look, you have every right
to be angry, Jackson.

964
00:56:21,477 --> 00:56:24,355
But your father and I got
together long before we met.

965
00:56:24,557 --> 00:56:27,276
- It doesn't matter when.
- Is that what you think?

966
00:56:27,477 --> 00:56:29,752
We slept together on the first date.

967
00:56:29,997 --> 00:56:31,794
My dad's old school.
I know he hit it.

968
00:56:31,997 --> 00:56:35,876
- You don't know what you're saying.
- You saying he didn't hit it?

969
00:56:39,797 --> 00:56:42,516
Okay, Jackson, let's not do this.

970
00:56:42,717 --> 00:56:45,550
- Don't let this come between us.
- Come on, Denise.

971
00:56:45,797 --> 00:56:50,427
It's simple. Just say, " No, Jackson,
he didn't hit it," or, "Yes, he did."

972
00:56:51,397 --> 00:56:55,231
You dislike Fred so much,
you wouldn't believe me anyway.

973
00:56:55,437 --> 00:57:00,033
"Fred?" Well, I think I just got
my answer about you and "Fred."

974
00:57:02,157 --> 00:57:04,387
- You want an answer?
- I want an answer.

975
00:57:05,037 --> 00:57:08,507
We met a long time ago,
dated a little but didn't have sex.

976
00:57:08,717 --> 00:57:10,708
You didn't have sex?
Did you kiss?

977
00:57:11,797 --> 00:57:12,786
Yes.

978
00:57:13,317 --> 00:57:15,387
So now we're getting somewhere.
So, did...

979
00:57:15,637 --> 00:57:17,867
I'm won't be interrogated about this.

980
00:57:19,317 --> 00:57:20,989
Yeah, that's what I thought.

981
00:57:23,597 --> 00:57:26,828
You made a commitment for
the first time in your life.

982
00:57:27,037 --> 00:57:29,107
You're gonna walk away from
all that?

983
00:57:29,437 --> 00:57:31,587
I'm walking away from a woman who lied.

984
00:57:31,797 --> 00:57:34,948
Who deceived and hurt me.

985
00:57:35,197 --> 00:57:36,949
I won't give you what you want.

986
00:57:37,197 --> 00:57:41,952
- I'm not gonna let you just dump me.
- You're gonna dump me? Is that it?

987
00:57:42,357 --> 00:57:46,953
No. I'm gonna make you do
what's really in your heart.

988
00:57:47,197 --> 00:57:49,074
I'm gonna make you love me.

989
00:57:49,277 --> 00:57:50,551
That's cute...

990
00:57:50,797 --> 00:57:54,631
...that reverse psychology trick.
Try it on a brother with a GED.

991
00:57:54,837 --> 00:57:56,555
Because it gets none right here.

992
00:57:56,797 --> 00:57:58,788
It's no trick to it. It's the truth.

993
00:57:59,597 --> 00:58:02,270
You need me as much as I need you.

994
00:58:02,797 --> 00:58:07,109
So you can take me
with all of my flaws...

995
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:08,955
...or we can both be miserable.

996
00:58:15,637 --> 00:58:17,707
I know that you're scared.

997
00:58:19,997 --> 00:58:22,955
Every time someone's said
"I love you" it's turned bad.

998
00:58:23,157 --> 00:58:25,751
You don't know
what you're talking about.

999
00:58:26,637 --> 00:58:31,631
It's your mother, all your old
girlfriends, your father.

1000
00:58:33,357 --> 00:58:36,747
I know I should've told you
about this a long time ago.

1001
00:58:36,997 --> 00:58:40,307
But don't use it as an excuse to
go back to how you were.

1002
00:58:44,117 --> 00:58:45,516
Come on.

1003
00:58:46,277 --> 00:58:47,551
Please.

1004
00:58:56,957 --> 00:58:57,992
Let yourself out.

1005
01:00:20,997 --> 01:00:23,113
What the fuck?

1006
01:00:48,477 --> 01:00:50,911
Hey, Sheila, open the door!

1007
01:00:51,757 --> 01:00:53,349
Hey, my key don't work.

1008
01:00:53,597 --> 01:00:54,712
I changed the locks.

1009
01:00:54,917 --> 01:00:58,387
When you're the man that I married,
then you can come back.

1010
01:00:58,597 --> 01:01:00,633
Open the door, woman. I live here too!

1011
01:01:00,837 --> 01:01:04,830
Okay, how about you stay here
and I'll call L.A.P.D.

1012
01:01:05,037 --> 01:01:08,347
They're real sympathetic to
black men in domestic situations.

1013
01:01:08,557 --> 01:01:11,310
I'm not scared of no police!
Open the...

1014
01:01:11,517 --> 01:01:14,554
Woman, you lucky I just got saved.

1015
01:01:21,997 --> 01:01:23,316
Shut the fuck up!

1016
01:01:28,157 --> 01:01:29,510
- Hey.
- Hey.

1017
01:01:29,717 --> 01:01:30,945
Why you all dolled up?

1018
01:01:31,277 --> 01:01:32,949
Well, you know how I am.

1019
01:01:33,197 --> 01:01:35,506
I wine them, I dine them...

1020
01:01:35,717 --> 01:01:38,914
...and bam, it's all over.

1021
01:01:39,717 --> 01:01:41,514
What you doing here?

1022
01:01:42,517 --> 01:01:44,508
I just stopped by for a minute.

1023
01:01:45,197 --> 01:01:46,915
Who you got coming over?

1024
01:01:47,157 --> 01:01:51,753
Instead of being in my business,
why ain't you out looking for Denise?

1025
01:01:51,997 --> 01:01:53,715
You don't want to know.

1026
01:01:53,917 --> 01:01:56,556
Because she's definitely not the one.

1027
01:01:56,757 --> 01:01:59,794
You looked just like your daddy
when you said that.

1028
01:02:00,357 --> 01:02:02,473
You just found a way to make me leave.

1029
01:02:02,837 --> 01:02:05,510
Your father's coming by here tonight.

1030
01:02:06,957 --> 01:02:08,629
How long has this been going on?

1031
01:02:09,117 --> 01:02:13,793
Since your sister's party.
He apologized for bringing that girl.

1032
01:02:14,277 --> 01:02:16,313
And you know I was looking good.

1033
01:02:16,517 --> 01:02:19,907
Let me tell you about Daddy
and your golden girl, Denise.

1034
01:02:20,157 --> 01:02:21,476
They had a thing together.

1035
01:02:22,797 --> 01:02:23,707
I know.

1036
01:02:23,917 --> 01:02:26,147
You know? And you don't care?

1037
01:02:26,997 --> 01:02:27,827
No.

1038
01:02:28,597 --> 01:02:30,713
Because nothing happened between them.

1039
01:02:32,197 --> 01:02:34,313
It was before she met you.

1040
01:02:34,517 --> 01:02:37,873
Your father is charming and
handsome and all those things.

1041
01:02:38,277 --> 01:02:41,952
Did it occur to you that she might've
seen those qualities in you?

1042
01:02:42,557 --> 01:02:44,866
I can't believe she sucked you in.

1043
01:02:45,077 --> 01:02:46,715
She's not the one who told me.

1044
01:02:46,917 --> 01:02:49,431
She tried. But I didn't let her.

1045
01:02:49,677 --> 01:02:51,474
Your father told me everything.

1046
01:02:51,677 --> 01:02:53,349
Nobody cared enough to tell me?

1047
01:02:56,957 --> 01:02:59,551
What makes you think you
can trust him?

1048
01:03:00,197 --> 01:03:02,313
He didn't have to tell me, Jackson.

1049
01:03:02,517 --> 01:03:03,666
And I know him.

1050
01:03:05,557 --> 01:03:07,149
You have to stop seeing Daddy.

1051
01:03:09,117 --> 01:03:10,391
And do what?

1052
01:03:10,797 --> 01:03:11,786
Huh?

1053
01:03:12,357 --> 01:03:14,313
You're gone, your sister's leaving.

1054
01:03:14,557 --> 01:03:17,549
I throw parties here
just to have people around.

1055
01:03:17,797 --> 01:03:21,551
Your father and I are comfortable
with each other, Jackson.

1056
01:03:22,717 --> 01:03:23,866
And I have my needs.

1057
01:03:24,077 --> 01:03:25,226
Mama, not the needs.

1058
01:03:29,077 --> 01:03:31,307
I know that you still love him.

1059
01:03:32,437 --> 01:03:33,950
But you have to let him go.

1060
01:03:34,197 --> 01:03:35,516
No.

1061
01:03:36,117 --> 01:03:38,108
I won't let him go.

1062
01:03:39,357 --> 01:03:41,313
We had a marriage...

1063
01:03:41,517 --> 01:03:43,508
...love and children.

1064
01:03:44,117 --> 01:03:45,869
Nothing is stronger than that.

1065
01:03:46,357 --> 01:03:47,995
Okay. And then what?

1066
01:03:48,717 --> 01:03:51,277
He'll get you excited about
getting back together.

1067
01:03:51,597 --> 01:03:55,909
Then he's just gonna run
and break your heart again.

1068
01:03:59,717 --> 01:04:01,309
Maybe.

1069
01:04:02,557 --> 01:04:04,275
But I can handle that.

1070
01:04:12,837 --> 01:04:15,305
That girl loves you.

1071
01:04:16,917 --> 01:04:18,475
What you gonna do about it?

1072
01:04:25,837 --> 01:04:27,509
I gotta go.

1073
01:04:33,997 --> 01:04:35,794
<i>Do you still think about her?</i>

1074
01:04:36,757 --> 01:04:39,112
Yeah, every day.

1075
01:04:40,197 --> 01:04:44,475
Do you still think that she and your
father were sexually intimate?

1076
01:04:45,317 --> 01:04:46,716
I don't know.

1077
01:04:48,597 --> 01:04:50,110
Probably not.

1078
01:04:50,797 --> 01:04:53,994
If that's the case,
why don't you go back to her?

1079
01:04:54,597 --> 01:04:55,746
Talk it out.

1080
01:04:55,997 --> 01:05:00,627
I just don't have it in me, you know?
I get too mad. Too scared.

1081
01:05:01,597 --> 01:05:02,825
Let's explore that.

1082
01:05:03,037 --> 01:05:05,232
No offense,
but this will be my last session.

1083
01:05:05,557 --> 01:05:07,115
You're giving up?

1084
01:05:07,517 --> 01:05:10,315
Love's supposed to be
beautiful, but I can't get it.

1085
01:05:10,517 --> 01:05:12,712
I'm up, love's down.
I'm left, love's right.

1086
01:05:12,917 --> 01:05:16,193
I'm ready, love says, " Not yet,
she dated your father."

1087
01:05:17,157 --> 01:05:20,706
Maybe there is love out there,
but it's running from me.

1088
01:05:21,717 --> 01:05:22,945
I can't keep chasing it.

1089
01:05:23,197 --> 01:05:24,915
Jackson?

1090
01:05:26,477 --> 01:05:28,513
That's the kind of existence you want?

1091
01:05:29,357 --> 01:05:31,917
Life without love in it?

1092
01:05:47,757 --> 01:05:49,315
A girl just beat you for game.

1093
01:05:49,517 --> 01:05:50,313
My bad, man.

1094
01:05:50,557 --> 01:05:53,151
You need a dress
the way you've been playing.

1095
01:05:54,957 --> 01:05:58,632
Yo, kid, I'm sorry to hear
about you and Sheila.

1096
01:05:58,877 --> 01:06:02,711
Yeah, I was too, but that's life.

1097
01:06:02,957 --> 01:06:04,151
No, that's just women.

1098
01:06:04,397 --> 01:06:06,228
Oh, come on. Shut up!

1099
01:06:06,477 --> 01:06:08,752
They always trying to
jam up a brother.

1100
01:06:08,957 --> 01:06:11,710
And they always complain
like we're the bad guys.

1101
01:06:11,917 --> 01:06:14,556
<i>Writing man-hating books
like, Waiting to Exhale.</i>

1102
01:06:14,797 --> 01:06:18,915
Check this out. I'm gonna write
a book called, "Breathe, Bitch."

1103
01:06:19,757 --> 01:06:21,110
Boy, you are retarded.

1104
01:06:21,317 --> 01:06:23,512
You always gotta use that word?

1105
01:06:23,757 --> 01:06:25,952
I use the word because it applies.

1106
01:06:26,157 --> 01:06:27,715
You need to check yourself.

1107
01:06:27,917 --> 01:06:30,556
You better start
showing the ladies some love.

1108
01:06:30,797 --> 01:06:32,913
Come on, all the shit you be doing?

1109
01:06:33,117 --> 01:06:34,755
You can't call women names.

1110
01:06:34,957 --> 01:06:36,310
- Oh, really?
- Really.

1111
01:06:36,517 --> 01:06:37,711
"Bitches" by Terry White.

1112
01:06:37,917 --> 01:06:41,910
No, no, no, not the poem.
That was when I was 10 years old.

1113
01:06:42,597 --> 01:06:47,717
<i>I would trade my life
And all its riches</i>

1114
01:06:47,957 --> 01:06:50,107
<i>To rid my life of all the bitches</i>

1115
01:06:50,917 --> 01:06:53,636
<i>To watch a game
Just eating and drinking</i>

1116
01:06:53,877 --> 01:06:56,391
<i>To say, "Yo, get out my face"
When she asks</i>

1117
01:06:56,637 --> 01:06:58,707
<i>"Baby, what you thinking?"</i>

1118
01:06:58,957 --> 01:07:02,506
<i>To hang with my boys
And not worry a bit</i>

1119
01:07:02,717 --> 01:07:06,949
<i>To get me a little ass
And get on with my shit</i>

1120
01:07:07,157 --> 01:07:08,636
<i>To have a good life, baby</i>

1121
01:07:08,837 --> 01:07:12,955
<i>Free from affliction, pregnant
And in the motherfucking kitchen</i>

1122
01:07:13,157 --> 01:07:14,272
You are stupid.

1123
01:07:14,877 --> 01:07:17,516
<i>But they got the booty,
Now that's the hitch</i>

1124
01:07:17,917 --> 01:07:21,307
<i>And us without them
Now ain't that a bitch?</i>

1125
01:07:21,557 --> 01:07:23,115
- There's issues.
- Thank you.

1126
01:07:23,317 --> 01:07:25,592
I know y'all feeling me right now.

1127
01:07:25,797 --> 01:07:28,516
You will never work
for Hallmark that way.

1128
01:07:34,997 --> 01:07:35,952
Where have you been?

1129
01:07:36,197 --> 01:07:37,107
I'm going crazy.

1130
01:07:37,317 --> 01:07:38,989
Calm down and tell me what's up.

1131
01:07:39,237 --> 01:07:40,955
She's having some kind of a fit.

1132
01:07:41,197 --> 01:07:44,394
- I think it's about Daddy.
- I'm gonna put an end to this.

1133
01:07:46,117 --> 01:07:49,587
Surprise!

1134
01:07:50,077 --> 01:07:51,476
I'm sorry, big brother.

1135
01:07:53,037 --> 01:07:55,312
God, it was so easy to fool you.

1136
01:07:55,797 --> 01:07:59,267
That's because you getting
old, baby boy.

1137
01:07:59,477 --> 01:08:00,626
Your mind is first to go.

1138
01:08:00,877 --> 01:08:02,469
You know what goes after that.

1139
01:08:03,157 --> 01:08:05,717
- Happy birthday, baby.
- Thank you.

1140
01:08:06,557 --> 01:08:07,546
Happy birthday, son.

1141
01:08:10,157 --> 01:08:12,546
Hey, J, where's your walker, man?

1142
01:08:12,797 --> 01:08:14,913
Happy birthday, man. Oh, wait...

1143
01:08:15,157 --> 01:08:18,229
...something done fell out.

1144
01:08:18,477 --> 01:08:21,708
Get you some of them blue slacks
that's tight in the front.

1145
01:08:34,037 --> 01:08:36,107
Hey, you okay, son?

1146
01:08:39,957 --> 01:08:42,107
You been moping around all night.

1147
01:08:42,757 --> 01:08:46,306
If I didn't know better, I'd think
this was an early midlife crisis.

1148
01:08:46,997 --> 01:08:48,112
Something like that.

1149
01:08:49,997 --> 01:08:52,909
Hell, I'd trade places
with you in a heartbeat.

1150
01:08:53,677 --> 01:08:55,110
Shit.

1151
01:08:55,357 --> 01:09:00,112
Wait till you get to be my age.
That's when your body goes crazy.

1152
01:09:00,397 --> 01:09:03,389
You lose the hair on your head
and grow it in your nose.

1153
01:09:03,637 --> 01:09:06,356
Why didn't you tell me
you dated Denise?

1154
01:09:11,917 --> 01:09:13,316
She asked me not to.

1155
01:09:13,717 --> 01:09:15,912
I mean, you seem to like Denise...

1156
01:09:16,117 --> 01:09:18,153
...and I saw no reason
to stand in the way.

1157
01:09:18,477 --> 01:09:22,709
I believe you young guys
call that, "player hating."

1158
01:09:26,957 --> 01:09:28,629
Why don't we talk later?

1159
01:09:28,837 --> 01:09:30,714
After everybody's gone.

1160
01:09:31,037 --> 01:09:31,913
Okay?

1161
01:09:32,157 --> 01:09:34,955
Let's talk about why you're
sleeping with my mother.

1162
01:09:37,597 --> 01:09:41,385
Louise and I have an arrangement.
That's all.

1163
01:09:42,157 --> 01:09:45,274
Damn it, son, I'm sorry. Okay?

1164
01:09:45,477 --> 01:09:47,672
That's the first thing I agree with.

1165
01:09:48,117 --> 01:09:51,154
You know what I realized?
I'm just like you.

1166
01:09:51,797 --> 01:09:54,311
I can't do right by a woman either.

1167
01:09:56,397 --> 01:10:00,026
Okay. Okay.

1168
01:10:00,277 --> 01:10:01,915
I deserved that.

1169
01:10:02,557 --> 01:10:05,435
I haven't been much of a friend
or a father lately.

1170
01:10:05,637 --> 01:10:07,787
See, I hate it when you do that.

1171
01:10:07,997 --> 01:10:10,033
- When I do what?
- Rationalize your faults.

1172
01:10:10,557 --> 01:10:13,515
Can't you have one moment of shame
about your shit?

1173
01:10:13,957 --> 01:10:16,391
- What's gotten into you?
- You.

1174
01:10:17,677 --> 01:10:21,909
I inherited your eyes, your nose,
and your ugly contempt for women.

1175
01:10:22,797 --> 01:10:25,027
- You don't mean that.
- Oh, yes, I do.

1176
01:10:27,397 --> 01:10:30,628
You broke up the family with your
arrogance and selfishness.

1177
01:10:31,277 --> 01:10:33,029
Somehow it's gotten into me.

1178
01:10:34,917 --> 01:10:38,466
It's been a long night. I think
you've had too much to drink...

1179
01:10:38,677 --> 01:10:42,352
- I don't want to talk to your ass.
- No, son. I'm talking to you.

1180
01:10:44,077 --> 01:10:47,433
Because you've been drinking,
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

1181
01:10:47,757 --> 01:10:49,713
- Really?
- Really.

1182
01:10:50,077 --> 01:10:51,476
Stay the fuck out my life.

1183
01:10:53,157 --> 01:10:54,909
Did you hear that?

1184
01:10:57,037 --> 01:10:58,311
Let me tell you something.

1185
01:10:58,677 --> 01:11:02,795
- I'm still your father! You do not...
- Fred. Hey, Fred.

1186
01:11:02,997 --> 01:11:07,513
Come on, dance with me, baby.
Come on, now.

1187
01:11:40,317 --> 01:11:41,545
Terry's not coming?

1188
01:11:41,797 --> 01:11:45,233
Nah, he hooked up with BeBe.
They're meeting a wedding planner.

1189
01:11:45,477 --> 01:11:47,115
See, it's starting already.

1190
01:11:47,317 --> 01:11:51,515
You put your boys on the back burner
and more and more you just don't care.

1191
01:11:51,717 --> 01:11:56,313
Next, you're wearing an apron
and got a feather duster up your ass.

1192
01:11:56,557 --> 01:12:00,436
Why do all your stories end with
a feather duster up somebody's ass?

1193
01:12:00,677 --> 01:12:02,110
This guy...

1194
01:12:03,997 --> 01:12:05,828
Damn. Hey, look, Jack.

1195
01:12:06,157 --> 01:12:09,308
Turn around slowly,
and look who just walked in.

1196
01:12:15,117 --> 01:12:15,913
Hi, guys.

1197
01:12:17,357 --> 01:12:18,153
Denise.

1198
01:12:18,917 --> 01:12:20,066
Hey...

1199
01:12:20,517 --> 01:12:22,235
...you want to go talk?

1200
01:12:22,597 --> 01:12:25,509
I don't really think that's
gonna be a good idea.

1201
01:12:26,477 --> 01:12:29,992
This is Zeno. Zeno, that's Jackson...

1202
01:12:30,197 --> 01:12:32,153
...Derrick and that's Brian.
- Denise.

1203
01:12:32,677 --> 01:12:33,792
I see our people, honey.

1204
01:12:34,037 --> 01:12:36,995
That's right.
Nice to see you guys again.

1205
01:12:41,077 --> 01:12:42,192
He's not her type.

1206
01:12:42,397 --> 01:12:43,386
Is he white?

1207
01:12:43,597 --> 01:12:45,986
She's trying to get me mad.
I'm not stressing.

1208
01:12:46,197 --> 01:12:47,755
No, I think he's Asian.

1209
01:12:47,957 --> 01:12:49,709
It's the oldest trick in the book.

1210
01:12:49,917 --> 01:12:52,750
She brings some cat
to make it look like she don't care.

1211
01:12:52,997 --> 01:12:53,907
I don't buy it.

1212
01:12:54,157 --> 01:12:55,510
Maybe he's Latino or Indian.

1213
01:12:55,757 --> 01:12:59,796
- What difference does race make?
- So Jack will know how pissed to be.

1214
01:12:59,997 --> 01:13:02,113
But Jackson is not mad. All right?

1215
01:13:02,317 --> 01:13:03,432
I'm gonna go talk to her.

1216
01:13:03,637 --> 01:13:05,229
Whoa, scooter. Come on, now.

1217
01:13:05,477 --> 01:13:07,547
That's what she wants you to do.

1218
01:13:07,757 --> 01:13:11,147
- He might know karate. Right, Brian?
- Very funny, Derrick.

1219
01:13:11,357 --> 01:13:13,427
There's a lot of ladies up in here.

1220
01:13:13,677 --> 01:13:16,396
- Let's get our little party on.
- You're right.

1221
01:13:16,637 --> 01:13:17,786
You know...

1222
01:13:18,197 --> 01:13:20,427
...it's an epidemic here.
Check this out.

1223
01:13:20,677 --> 01:13:21,905
What?

1224
01:13:25,597 --> 01:13:27,906
I know she ain't just
dis me like that.

1225
01:13:28,157 --> 01:13:30,796
- Coming up in here with Amistad.
- "Give us free."

1226
01:13:32,157 --> 01:13:35,308
- This joint is hot tonight.
- Could we get this check?

1227
01:13:35,597 --> 01:13:36,712
Okay, it's coming.

1228
01:13:36,957 --> 01:13:39,107
I ain't leaving.
She ain't running me out.

1229
01:13:39,357 --> 01:13:40,187
Know what I realized?

1230
01:13:40,397 --> 01:13:44,151
I'm separated from my wife,
and yet, doing better than both of you.

1231
01:13:44,397 --> 01:13:47,309
- Shut the fuck up, all right?
- Don't be mad at me.

1232
01:14:10,797 --> 01:14:14,107
Well, all right.
The separation agreement is complete.

1233
01:14:23,957 --> 01:14:25,436
What's up? You all right?

1234
01:14:25,677 --> 01:14:27,508
No, I'm not all right.

1235
01:14:27,757 --> 01:14:29,907
What's going on, man?
Talk to me.

1236
01:14:32,317 --> 01:14:33,716
Hey, have a drink.

1237
01:14:38,917 --> 01:14:41,033
Terry, no, man, no.

1238
01:14:41,277 --> 01:14:44,075
J, man, I can't do it.
I can't do it.

1239
01:14:45,517 --> 01:14:47,667
I was cool until a few days ago.

1240
01:14:48,317 --> 01:14:52,913
But, man, I looked at the calendar.
This wedding is two weeks away.

1241
01:14:53,397 --> 01:14:54,716
Two weeks!

1242
01:14:55,437 --> 01:14:57,553
I'm making a big mistake
marrying BeBe.

1243
01:14:57,797 --> 01:14:59,150
It's just cold feet, man.

1244
01:14:59,357 --> 01:15:01,746
It's not cold feet. I'm telling you.

1245
01:15:01,997 --> 01:15:02,793
I'm not ready.

1246
01:15:02,997 --> 01:15:06,034
- You're supposed to have it together.
- I know.

1247
01:15:07,757 --> 01:15:09,713
I did, man. I did.

1248
01:15:10,397 --> 01:15:12,706
I thought it was time, you know?

1249
01:15:14,597 --> 01:15:19,307
I think I was trying to make myself
believe I could move on with my life.

1250
01:15:19,517 --> 01:15:22,907
But every time I looked in the mirror,
I realized it wasn't true.

1251
01:15:24,997 --> 01:15:26,828
So how did BeBe take it?

1252
01:15:29,957 --> 01:15:33,313
- You didn't tell her?
- No, I told her, J. I told her.

1253
01:15:33,997 --> 01:15:35,669
I left her a message.

1254
01:15:35,877 --> 01:15:37,026
On her machine?

1255
01:15:37,277 --> 01:15:39,427
- On her machine?
- Yeah, I left a message.

1256
01:15:39,677 --> 01:15:42,908
- Why don't you back off?
- Don't scream. It's your shit.

1257
01:15:44,397 --> 01:15:46,115
All right, my bad, man.

1258
01:15:46,357 --> 01:15:47,915
She already heard the message.

1259
01:15:48,117 --> 01:15:50,153
She called me 10 times today.

1260
01:15:51,197 --> 01:15:52,755
You got anything stronger?

1261
01:15:53,477 --> 01:15:54,626
I'm calling the fellas.

1262
01:15:54,837 --> 01:15:56,668
No, don't call nobody, man.

1263
01:15:56,877 --> 01:15:58,595
You need to be with your boys.

1264
01:15:58,797 --> 01:16:01,755
Don't call Brian.
I already know what he's gonna say.

1265
01:16:02,117 --> 01:16:05,314
I knew it, I knew it, I knew it!

1266
01:16:07,917 --> 01:16:08,793
Brian...

1267
01:16:08,997 --> 01:16:10,066
...fuck you.

1268
01:16:10,277 --> 01:16:12,552
Sorry, Terry, but I did. I know you.

1269
01:16:12,797 --> 01:16:14,753
You don't want to get married.

1270
01:16:14,997 --> 01:16:18,148
The way you dropped her on
the machine, that was brilliant.

1271
01:16:18,397 --> 01:16:21,275
Come on, Brian.
Have some sympathy for the man.

1272
01:16:21,797 --> 01:16:24,994
Hey, hey, Terry? I know how you feel.

1273
01:16:25,397 --> 01:16:26,352
Look...

1274
01:16:27,397 --> 01:16:29,592
...I haven't told you fellas this...

1275
01:16:29,837 --> 01:16:32,749
...but I married Sheila
because she was pregnant.

1276
01:16:32,957 --> 01:16:34,709
Oh, we knew that. Come on, man.

1277
01:16:34,957 --> 01:16:39,075
All right, the point is, we fell
in love later and shit was good.

1278
01:16:39,717 --> 01:16:42,515
Yeah, I had second thoughts,
thirds and fourths too.

1279
01:16:42,717 --> 01:16:45,629
You've got to find a reason
to go back to that girl.

1280
01:16:45,877 --> 01:16:48,949
Derrick, how can you even say
that after what Sheila did?

1281
01:16:49,157 --> 01:16:52,672
All right, so I made a mistake.
But I made it like a man.

1282
01:16:52,957 --> 01:16:56,233
I stood up for what was right,
and Terry should do the same.

1283
01:16:56,437 --> 01:16:59,634
Then he'd cheat BeBe and himself.
You think about this, D.

1284
01:16:59,917 --> 01:17:01,987
Jack, what kind of friends
are you two?

1285
01:17:02,357 --> 01:17:03,790
He's gotta do the right thing.

1286
01:17:03,997 --> 01:17:05,396
Terry needs to run like hell.

1287
01:17:05,597 --> 01:17:07,508
You need to shut your ass up!

1288
01:17:07,717 --> 01:17:10,356
- Why I gotta shut up, Derrick?
- Shut up!

1289
01:17:10,557 --> 01:17:11,910
I'm just telling the truth.

1290
01:17:12,117 --> 01:17:14,187
- Brian?
- My bad, my bad.

1291
01:17:14,397 --> 01:17:17,753
I'm gonna do this for Jack, all right?
I apologize.

1292
01:17:17,957 --> 01:17:19,948
Yeah, me too. Sorry.

1293
01:17:22,957 --> 01:17:24,629
Denise dated my father before me.

1294
01:17:24,837 --> 01:17:26,429
Goddamn! Oh, shit!

1295
01:17:26,877 --> 01:17:28,595
- Get out. For real?
- Yeah.

1296
01:17:28,797 --> 01:17:30,230
Denise boned your father?

1297
01:17:30,677 --> 01:17:34,716
No, she said it was just a date,
but she kept that shit from me.

1298
01:17:35,157 --> 01:17:37,273
When I found out,
I had to cut her loose.

1299
01:17:38,197 --> 01:17:40,506
Yo, man, I don't blame you for that.

1300
01:17:41,077 --> 01:17:43,910
But I thought we had
something special, you know?

1301
01:17:44,677 --> 01:17:46,315
I lost it.

1302
01:17:46,757 --> 01:17:49,510
Ain't no loss.
If she boned your father, she's a ho.

1303
01:17:49,717 --> 01:17:51,150
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1304
01:17:51,357 --> 01:17:54,235
- What you talking about?
- He's your boy, show respect.

1305
01:17:54,437 --> 01:17:57,509
Why I can't speak my mind?
I got shit to say tonight.

1306
01:17:57,757 --> 01:17:58,553
You ignorant.

1307
01:17:58,757 --> 01:18:01,908
Forget it. You know what, Jack?
I apologize, all right?

1308
01:18:04,397 --> 01:18:06,115
Anybody else got some revelations?

1309
01:18:09,717 --> 01:18:11,309
My wife wouldn't go down on me.

1310
01:18:11,517 --> 01:18:13,553
- Shut up.
- You might keep that to yourself.

1311
01:18:13,917 --> 01:18:18,433
Either we weren't strong or she didn't
care. Either way, I got dry dick.

1312
01:18:18,637 --> 01:18:21,834
I'm scared to zip my pants.
I'll go off like a firecracker.

1313
01:18:22,037 --> 01:18:24,756
Yo, that's irreconcilable
differences for your ass.

1314
01:18:24,957 --> 01:18:29,906
They gotta put that in wedding vows.
Love, honour, obey, and slob the knob.

1315
01:18:30,117 --> 01:18:31,709
For sure.

1316
01:18:33,677 --> 01:18:36,032
Fellas, I been doing some thinking.

1317
01:18:36,277 --> 01:18:38,233
We talk a whole lot of shit.

1318
01:18:38,437 --> 01:18:42,112
Complaining about the honeys,
what they want, what they don't want.

1319
01:18:43,357 --> 01:18:46,110
Maybe the ladies ain't the problem.
Maybe we are.

1320
01:18:47,677 --> 01:18:50,828
- What type of shit are you talking?
- Just feel me on this.

1321
01:18:51,077 --> 01:18:53,432
Maybe we need to check our own shit.

1322
01:18:53,637 --> 01:18:56,390
Come your shabbado-for-
electric-boogaloo ass, home.

1323
01:18:56,597 --> 01:19:00,112
You go home and spank your monkey.
That's some lonely shit.

1324
01:19:01,277 --> 01:19:03,347
That's why you got desert dick.

1325
01:19:04,317 --> 01:19:06,387
So how's BeBe doing, man?

1326
01:19:06,597 --> 01:19:07,746
Shit, terrible.

1327
01:19:07,997 --> 01:19:13,117
She came by this morning,
crying, screaming, and carrying on.

1328
01:19:13,317 --> 01:19:16,753
I had to run out the back door.
She was acting all crazy.

1329
01:19:16,957 --> 01:19:18,788
I can't blame her, Mr. Telephone Man.

1330
01:19:19,037 --> 01:19:22,552
- You probably called her ass collect.
- You ain't funny, man.

1331
01:19:22,757 --> 01:19:25,988
She followed me to work.
Had me hiding in the janitor's closet.

1332
01:19:26,197 --> 01:19:27,755
You have to stop doing that.

1333
01:19:27,997 --> 01:19:31,433
You owe that woman the respect
of telling her face to face.

1334
01:19:31,637 --> 01:19:33,434
I know, but you're not hearing me.

1335
01:19:33,677 --> 01:19:36,111
BeBe was on some different shit, J.

1336
01:19:36,317 --> 01:19:38,228
We'll talk, but she needs to chill.

1337
01:19:39,077 --> 01:19:41,545
- I just need more time.
- More time, all right.

1338
01:19:41,757 --> 01:19:44,317
We're gonna get carjacked.
Where you taking me?

1339
01:19:44,557 --> 01:19:46,946
- We got to get Brian's issued ass.
- For what?

1340
01:19:47,157 --> 01:19:49,717
Man, his car is all jacked up.

1341
01:19:50,157 --> 01:19:53,354
I told his punk ass
to move up out this neighbourhood.

1342
01:19:53,557 --> 01:19:56,151
No, some woman is stalking him.

1343
01:19:56,397 --> 01:19:58,911
- Shut the fuck up.
- No, I'm serious.

1344
01:19:59,117 --> 01:20:03,190
And he's messed over so many women,
he don't even know which one it is.

1345
01:20:05,077 --> 01:20:06,829
Ugly! Ugly! Ugly!

1346
01:20:07,037 --> 01:20:08,834
These don't go in my magazine.

1347
01:20:09,077 --> 01:20:14,105
I don't know where you got these from.
I hire a good photographer...

1348
01:20:14,317 --> 01:20:17,115
Could you excuse me for a minute?
Thank you.

1349
01:20:26,197 --> 01:20:30,509
I just thought I'd come by and say hi.

1350
01:20:31,557 --> 01:20:33,548
No reason we can't be civil.

1351
01:20:35,797 --> 01:20:39,949
For what it's worth, I'm sorry
about all those nasty things I said.

1352
01:20:40,157 --> 01:20:42,955
We gotta be around each other
for the baby...

1353
01:20:43,197 --> 01:20:45,757
...so I was hoping we could be
adults about it.

1354
01:20:47,877 --> 01:20:49,105
All right.

1355
01:20:50,117 --> 01:20:52,756
I went out last weekend
with my girlfriends.

1356
01:20:53,397 --> 01:20:57,310
Kind of a
freedom-celebration-type thing.

1357
01:20:57,557 --> 01:20:58,910
Freedom?

1358
01:20:59,677 --> 01:21:01,076
I shouldn't hear this.

1359
01:21:01,277 --> 01:21:03,711
- And this guy asked me to dance.
- What guy?

1360
01:21:03,957 --> 01:21:06,425
Just some guy that asked me to dance.

1361
01:21:06,677 --> 01:21:09,510
And I just started crying.
It freaked him out.

1362
01:21:10,317 --> 01:21:13,946
Then my girlfriends told me
it was natural to feel that way.

1363
01:21:14,397 --> 01:21:16,752
They started talking about their ex's.

1364
01:21:16,997 --> 01:21:21,354
And these women have been disrespected
in ways you couldn't imagine.

1365
01:21:21,597 --> 01:21:23,827
And I'm sitting there,
thinking to myself...

1366
01:21:24,077 --> 01:21:27,911
...my husband just wanted to make love
to me and care for his mother.

1367
01:21:28,117 --> 01:21:30,915
And I just felt so stupid.

1368
01:21:33,197 --> 01:21:34,391
What are you saying?

1369
01:21:36,717 --> 01:21:40,505
I'm saying, I was wrong, Derrick.

1370
01:21:40,717 --> 01:21:42,036
I love you so much.

1371
01:21:42,277 --> 01:21:46,190
You mean the world to me, and I didn't
realize how much that was worth.

1372
01:21:48,557 --> 01:21:53,756
I tried to hurt you by bringing Mama
without talking it over.

1373
01:21:54,317 --> 01:21:56,672
- Yes, you did.
- Hey, I apologize.

1374
01:21:56,877 --> 01:21:58,435
Okay.

1375
01:21:59,277 --> 01:22:03,236
If it's okay with you,
can I be your husband again?

1376
01:22:04,557 --> 01:22:07,435
Oh, baby, I forgot how cute you are...

1377
01:22:07,677 --> 01:22:10,396
...when you get mushy.

1378
01:22:18,957 --> 01:22:21,391
Okay, wait, go lock the door.
Lock the door.

1379
01:22:21,637 --> 01:22:23,593
Don't threaten me with a good time.

1380
01:22:36,357 --> 01:22:37,995
Oh, Sheila.

1381
01:22:45,757 --> 01:22:46,985
Hell, no.

1382
01:22:48,637 --> 01:22:49,626
Jack.

1383
01:22:56,277 --> 01:22:58,507
- Goddamn!
- Hey, what's up, fellas?

1384
01:22:58,717 --> 01:23:00,787
- Like your paint job.
- That is sweet.

1385
01:23:01,837 --> 01:23:05,386
- You're in your drawers. Get dressed.
- Let me get out this suit.

1386
01:23:05,637 --> 01:23:07,867
You know, you gotta get a maid.

1387
01:23:08,077 --> 01:23:09,271
She didn't work out.

1388
01:23:09,917 --> 01:23:12,750
- You had sex with her, didn't you?
- She was fine.

1389
01:23:15,997 --> 01:23:17,589
Get down! Get down!

1390
01:23:17,837 --> 01:23:20,305
- I told you to move!
- Why you yelling at me?

1391
01:23:20,557 --> 01:23:21,990
I ain't out there shooting!

1392
01:23:22,237 --> 01:23:24,797
You need to stop arguing
and call the cops.

1393
01:23:25,037 --> 01:23:28,791
Terry! I want to talk to you, honey!

1394
01:23:29,037 --> 01:23:30,709
That's your bitch!

1395
01:23:32,477 --> 01:23:33,705
That is BeBe, man.

1396
01:23:33,957 --> 01:23:36,312
- She's trying to kill us.
- Go and talk to her.

1397
01:23:36,557 --> 01:23:39,196
What will I say,
how many bullets to put in my ass?

1398
01:23:39,437 --> 01:23:42,429
I ain't going out like a punk.
I'll tell her how I feel.

1399
01:23:43,557 --> 01:23:44,626
It's better here.

1400
01:23:44,877 --> 01:23:48,028
I told you she won first place
in a marksman contest.

1401
01:23:48,277 --> 01:23:50,632
<i>You gotta piss off
the bitch from The Matrix.</i>

1402
01:23:50,877 --> 01:23:52,788
Terry, come on, baby, I...

1403
01:23:53,917 --> 01:23:54,906
...love...

1404
01:23:55,397 --> 01:23:56,671
...you.

1405
01:23:58,877 --> 01:24:02,233
- What's going on?
- We're gonna be here all day.

1406
01:24:02,477 --> 01:24:04,388
Somebody will call the police.

1407
01:24:04,637 --> 01:24:07,629
In this neighbourhood?
A gunshot's like a doorbell.

1408
01:24:07,877 --> 01:24:10,994
- Okay, wait. I'll go talk to her.
- What?

1409
01:24:11,197 --> 01:24:14,633
If she wanted to shoot us, she would
have by now. I'll talk her down.

1410
01:24:14,877 --> 01:24:16,993
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

1411
01:24:17,237 --> 01:24:19,432
J, wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1412
01:24:19,677 --> 01:24:21,793
I got us in this mess.
I'll get us out.

1413
01:24:21,997 --> 01:24:25,034
No, no, Terry.
She is mad at you. I'll do it.

1414
01:24:25,277 --> 01:24:26,266
Cool.

1415
01:24:27,437 --> 01:24:28,586
What?

1416
01:24:29,637 --> 01:24:30,706
Be careful, J.

1417
01:24:30,957 --> 01:24:32,436
Terry, baby!

1418
01:24:32,677 --> 01:24:36,226
- What's she doing here?
- She's been following me around.

1419
01:24:36,477 --> 01:24:37,796
BeBe?

1420
01:24:39,557 --> 01:24:40,592
BeBe?

1421
01:24:49,077 --> 01:24:50,988
It's me, Jackson.

1422
01:24:51,437 --> 01:24:54,395
I don't want you, Jackson.
I want Terry!

1423
01:24:54,677 --> 01:24:57,794
All right, BeBe, listen to me
for a minute, okay?

1424
01:24:57,997 --> 01:25:01,273
Terry, get out here before
I shoot his dick off!

1425
01:25:01,477 --> 01:25:05,595
Hey, wait. You don't want to do
something you're gonna regret.

1426
01:25:06,877 --> 01:25:09,152
Now listen, BeBe, I know how you feel.

1427
01:25:10,797 --> 01:25:12,469
Men don't know shit!

1428
01:25:13,037 --> 01:25:17,553
No, I do know. See, right now,
you're feeling like you're nothing.

1429
01:25:19,877 --> 01:25:21,276
Oh, okay.

1430
01:25:22,237 --> 01:25:26,674
You look out to the world and all you
can see is the person that you want...

1431
01:25:27,677 --> 01:25:29,793
...the love that you thought
was yours.

1432
01:25:30,277 --> 01:25:33,189
I know, because I've made women
feel that way, BeBe.

1433
01:25:34,037 --> 01:25:36,392
For the first time,
it's come back on me.

1434
01:25:38,357 --> 01:25:40,188
I made Denise leave me.

1435
01:25:40,397 --> 01:25:45,790
I let my problems blind me for what
I've been looking for my entire life.

1436
01:25:48,277 --> 01:25:50,347
I feel like somebody dropped
a mountain on my heart.

1437
01:25:51,437 --> 01:25:53,268
What're you talking about, Jack?

1438
01:25:54,077 --> 01:25:56,989
I'm talking about love, BeBe.

1439
01:25:58,237 --> 01:26:02,992
Now, if you really love
Terry, and I know you do...

1440
01:26:04,357 --> 01:26:07,076
...then losing you will hurt him more
than anything.

1441
01:26:09,837 --> 01:26:12,192
But he's got to find that out
for himself.

1442
01:26:13,437 --> 01:26:14,472
Okay?

1443
01:26:18,237 --> 01:26:21,786
It's okay. It's okay.

1444
01:26:21,997 --> 01:26:24,511
All right? Just give me the gun.

1445
01:26:26,237 --> 01:26:30,389
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay, all right?

1446
01:26:53,957 --> 01:26:55,026
BeBe, I'm sorry.

1447
01:26:58,397 --> 01:27:00,115
I'm sorry.

1448
01:27:15,477 --> 01:27:17,308
Who's gonna fix this shit?

1449
01:28:25,677 --> 01:28:27,793
Man, I thought I'd never see this day.

1450
01:28:28,397 --> 01:28:31,116
Me neither. But I'm loving it.

1451
01:28:31,357 --> 01:28:33,188
Yeah, me too.

1452
01:28:35,797 --> 01:28:39,187
Well, I'm gonna go meet some men.

1453
01:28:39,837 --> 01:28:41,395
No use wasting the dress.

1454
01:28:41,637 --> 01:28:43,992
No, wait, wait. Hey...

1455
01:28:48,357 --> 01:28:49,346
Hey, son.

1456
01:28:51,037 --> 01:28:54,632
I just wanted to say thank you
before it got all crazy around here.

1457
01:28:55,597 --> 01:28:56,586
Thank me for what?

1458
01:28:58,717 --> 01:28:59,991
Let's just say you...

1459
01:29:01,477 --> 01:29:02,705
...woke me up.

1460
01:29:03,877 --> 01:29:08,393
Helped me to turn my eyes back
to what's important in life.

1461
01:29:09,757 --> 01:29:14,273
You know, they say a father
should be wiser than his son.

1462
01:29:16,557 --> 01:29:19,355
I'm glad this time
it turned out not to be true.

1463
01:29:21,957 --> 01:29:25,154
Look at this. Look at this.

1464
01:29:28,037 --> 01:29:31,313
I love when my men are affectionate.

1465
01:29:45,797 --> 01:29:48,391
- I love you, Ma.
- I love you too.

1466
01:29:54,877 --> 01:29:57,994
- Hey, man, your brother's getting big.
- Yeah, yeah.

1467
01:29:58,197 --> 01:30:01,792
I finally talked my mom into letting
him stay with me too.

1468
01:30:02,157 --> 01:30:05,069
J, you're the man of the hour.
Moms and Pops are doing their thing.

1469
01:30:05,277 --> 01:30:07,791
- You gotta be feeling good.
- Yeah, man.

1470
01:30:07,997 --> 01:30:09,271
Congratulations.

1471
01:30:10,077 --> 01:30:13,706
I'm looking at your dad and your mom.
I can't believe he's doing it again.

1472
01:30:13,917 --> 01:30:15,350
He looks happy, don't he?

1473
01:30:15,557 --> 01:30:17,229
I'm just saying.

1474
01:30:17,477 --> 01:30:18,671
Just like me and mine.

1475
01:30:19,037 --> 01:30:22,871
I don't want to brag, but a young
brother is getting all he can stand.

1476
01:30:24,677 --> 01:30:26,588
- Back up off me.
- That's my man.

1477
01:30:26,797 --> 01:30:29,186
- Let's have a toast on that.
- I gotta hold out.

1478
01:30:29,397 --> 01:30:31,991
I gotta make sure BeBe's
not having flashbacks.

1479
01:30:32,197 --> 01:30:33,186
Give her some love.

1480
01:30:33,397 --> 01:30:35,353
Sheila, get away from BeBe.

1481
01:30:35,957 --> 01:30:39,836
I see a little something special
right there that I want to talk to.

1482
01:30:40,037 --> 01:30:41,595
- I got it, man.
- Talk to you later.

1483
01:30:41,837 --> 01:30:42,986
All right.

1484
01:30:46,637 --> 01:30:48,195
Excuse me.

1485
01:30:51,597 --> 01:30:53,315
- May I fill your glass?
- You may.

1486
01:30:53,557 --> 01:30:55,593
On that note, I'm gonna get a drink.

1487
01:30:55,837 --> 01:30:57,395
Get me another champagne.

1488
01:30:57,597 --> 01:31:00,987
Honey, if had I had a gun
the time I married Derrick...

1489
01:31:02,757 --> 01:31:04,076
Denise.

1490
01:31:05,117 --> 01:31:06,311
I need to talk to you.

1491
01:31:07,277 --> 01:31:09,393
I don't want to do this, Jackson.

1492
01:31:09,597 --> 01:31:12,669
I'm only here because
your mom asked me to come.

1493
01:31:12,877 --> 01:31:16,233
Wait, wait. I have to tell
you what's been happening to me.

1494
01:31:17,437 --> 01:31:20,952
It took a while to get it, but
I found out where we both went wrong.

1495
01:31:22,117 --> 01:31:24,392
It's your turn to give me a chance.

1496
01:31:27,037 --> 01:31:28,709
I'm sorry, I can't.

1497
01:31:32,237 --> 01:31:34,193
You said you'd make me love you.

1498
01:31:34,437 --> 01:31:37,588
Remember? You were right.

1499
01:31:39,637 --> 01:31:42,197
No. No, Jackson, I was wrong.

1500
01:31:42,397 --> 01:31:46,675
You know, I was wrong about the whole
thing, and it's too late anyway.

1501
01:31:46,917 --> 01:31:49,556
Look, I gotta go and there's no more
cake left anyway.

1502
01:31:56,037 --> 01:31:57,390
You can have mine.

1503
01:32:07,677 --> 01:32:08,746
It's good?

1504
01:32:09,357 --> 01:32:11,348
It's maybe the best thing
I've ever eaten.

1505
01:32:14,237 --> 01:32:15,795
Maybe we can talk...

1506
01:32:30,677 --> 01:32:32,588
- Like we ain't right here.
- Hello?

1507
01:32:34,357 --> 01:32:35,676
Do you need a minute?

1508
01:32:37,997 --> 01:32:38,986
Yeah.

1509
01:32:40,437 --> 01:32:43,395
- Don't go too far, okay?
- Never.

1510
01:32:44,637 --> 01:32:46,832
Oh, there they go.

1511
01:32:50,517 --> 01:32:53,827
- Here we go.
- Love sprung!

1512
01:32:54,077 --> 01:32:57,831
Hello, hello. Hey, Jackson,
what the hell was that, brother?

1513
01:32:58,077 --> 01:33:00,033
Brian, you wouldn't understand.

1514
01:33:00,277 --> 01:33:02,029
What you want to drink to?

1515
01:33:02,237 --> 01:33:05,195
- To love. No question.
- Hell, no. Do something else.

1516
01:33:05,437 --> 01:33:07,712
Here it is. I got it.
To us, fellas.

1517
01:33:07,917 --> 01:33:10,670
- Yeah, to the brothers.
- To the brothers!

1518
01:33:50,797 --> 01:33:52,833
So if I had a dick would you suck it?

1519
01:33:53,037 --> 01:33:57,155
Yes, I would suck your dick
with a midget attached to my ass!

1520
01:33:57,357 --> 01:34:00,269
You know what? I'm gonna go.
I gotta go, shit.

1521
01:34:00,517 --> 01:34:02,030
You gotta go shit.

1522
01:34:02,237 --> 01:34:05,354
It's all that messing with them
gold-digging booger bastards.

1523
01:34:05,997 --> 01:34:08,227
Try for big daddy.
Come on, now.

1524
01:34:08,477 --> 01:34:11,071
Just bob and weave
on the baldhead shaft.

1525
01:34:11,277 --> 01:34:12,915
I would suck it
till your head caved in!

1526
01:34:13,397 --> 01:34:14,671
- I reject my pussy.
- Again.

1527
01:34:14,877 --> 01:34:16,833
- I reject my pussy.
- The pussy?

1528
01:34:17,357 --> 01:34:18,676
Say, "Hi, Barnabas."

1529
01:34:19,237 --> 01:34:21,990
That's it. Mark it.

1530
01:34:23,077 --> 01:34:25,989
Sheila, you got me hard
as three Jaguar payments.

1531
01:34:26,277 --> 01:34:29,269
Yeah, early for a fuck,
late for everything else!

1532
01:34:29,477 --> 01:34:31,035
It's good for your complexion.

1533
01:34:31,277 --> 01:34:33,916
Your mama's skin isn't good
because she got Indian in her.

1534
01:34:34,277 --> 01:34:36,837
- I'll show you my technique.
- Okay, do it.

1535
01:34:37,037 --> 01:34:38,390
Give me that bottle.

1536
01:34:40,917 --> 01:34:41,952
I can't!

1537
01:34:42,157 --> 01:34:44,068
That ain't firewood.

1538
01:34:44,957 --> 01:34:46,356
Stop when you smell smoke.

1539
01:34:47,557 --> 01:34:48,956
Misery is a motherfucker.

1540
01:34:49,157 --> 01:34:52,115
Your mama sucks so much dick, she
has kneepads sewn in her dresses.

1541
01:34:52,597 --> 01:34:55,111
You could do it. Come on.

1542
01:34:55,357 --> 01:34:57,871
Don't be scared
of the one-eyed serpent.

1543
01:34:59,357 --> 01:35:01,996
I'd suck your dick wearing
a seventh-grade jockstrap...

1544
01:35:02,197 --> 01:35:04,472
<i>...doing the hambone to the theme
from Green Acres.</i>

1545
01:35:04,677 --> 01:35:06,872
You wouldn't have to use Noxzema
if you do it right!

1546
01:35:07,077 --> 01:35:08,396
What?

1547
01:35:09,877 --> 01:35:11,276
You getting some muscles.

1548
01:35:11,477 --> 01:35:15,675
Drawing a picture of the queen
and a sparkler in my ass!

1549
01:35:17,597 --> 01:35:18,586
I'll be right back.

1550
01:35:18,797 --> 01:35:21,470
I'd be your daddy,
but the line was too long.

1551
01:35:21,677 --> 01:35:25,147
- Dead ho, question mark ho.
- Have a good time.

1552
01:35:25,837 --> 01:35:29,512
No, not French. English!
You didn't understand none of that?

1553
01:35:31,597 --> 01:35:33,349
I ought to kick that bitch's ass!

1554
01:35:33,557 --> 01:35:37,470
<i>Eating a half a bag of Pop Rocks
and watching Dusty's Treehouse.</i>

1555
01:35:37,997 --> 01:35:40,227
Hey, don't be scared.
That ain't no eclipse.

1556
01:35:40,437 --> 01:35:41,790
It's just me.

1557
01:35:57,157 --> 01:35:59,955
Oh, sucky, sucky now.

1558
01:36:00,437 --> 01:36:04,555
Anybody else got some...
Anybody got some revelations?

1559
01:36:05,077 --> 01:36:08,194
I'm scared to zip my pants.
I'll fuck around...

1560
01:36:14,797 --> 01:36:17,391
Oh, thanks for coming.
Oh, that was lovely.
