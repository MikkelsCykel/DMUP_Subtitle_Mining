1
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,923
Enjoying that, are you, sir?

2
00:00:44,097 --> 00:00:47,472
Sergeant, my wife is
currently taking a course

3
00:00:47,646 --> 00:00:50,011
at the Continental School
of Gourmet Cooking.

4
00:00:50,185 --> 00:00:52,865
Apparently they don't know the principle:
To eat well in this country,

5
00:00:53,038 --> 00:00:55,404
one must have breakfast
three times a day.

6
00:00:55,578 --> 00:00:58,710
And an English breakfast at that.
I don't mean your <i>café complet.</i>

7
00:00:58,884 --> 00:01:01,946
- Beg pardon, sir?
- A cup of coffee half an inch deep,

8
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,460
in floating bits of boiled milk,
and a sweet bun full of air.

9
00:01:05,634 --> 00:01:07,930
- That's what I had this morning.
- I see what you mean, sir.

10
00:01:08,104 --> 00:01:10,992
- I'm a... Quaker Oats man, myself.
- (Chuckles)

11
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:12,627
<i>(Knock At Door)</i>

12
00:01:13,845 --> 00:01:15,515
Excuse me, sir.

13
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:18,751
This has just come in.
It's the lab report on the ten-pound note

14
00:01:18,925 --> 00:01:21,778
- that Blaney paid the hotel bill with.
- Yes.

15
00:01:21,952 --> 00:01:25,014
As you'll see, the note
bore traces of face powder

16
00:01:25,188 --> 00:01:27,658
identical to that which we found
in Mrs Blaney's handbag.

17
00:01:27,832 --> 00:01:30,615
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

18
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:33,155
Well, Sergeant, we were in luck after all.

19
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:37,365
- That just about does it for him.
- Looks very much like it.

20
00:01:37,539 --> 00:01:42,654
I've never run into any of these
jokers before. What are they like?

21
00:01:42,828 --> 00:01:45,333
Oh, they vary, but not a lot.

22
00:01:45,507 --> 00:01:48,464
The thing to remember is they hate
women, and are mostly impotent.

23
00:01:48,638 --> 00:01:54,170
- Impotent?
- Don't mistake rape for potency.

24
00:01:54,344 --> 00:01:55,736
In the latter stage of the disease,

25
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:59,320
it's the strangling, not the sex,
that brings them on.

26
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:01,686
Above all, of course, they're sadists.

27
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,295
- You know what they are, I'm sure.
- Oh, yes, sir.

28
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:08,470
If you don't, read all about it in here:
Mrs Blaney's divorce petition.

29
00:02:08,644 --> 00:02:11,184
It tells you a great deal
about the habits of our hero.

30
00:02:11,358 --> 00:02:13,446
<i>(Phone Ringing)</i>

31
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,533
Yeah?

32
00:02:15,707 --> 00:02:19,396
Right. Put him on.
Yes, Chief Inspector Oxford speaking.

33
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:23,118
My name is Forsythe, Inspector. Felix Forsythe.

34
00:02:23,292 --> 00:02:25,658
I run the Globe Public House, Covent Garden.

35
00:02:25,832 --> 00:02:29,242
I see from the newspaper you're
in charge of these strangling cases.

36
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:30,843
Yes, that is so.

37
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:33,696
Good, because I've got
some information to impart.

38
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:38,671
Now, this man you're looking for,
the one with the patches on his suit.

39
00:02:38,845 --> 00:02:41,802
I know him. He worked here as a barman.

40
00:02:41,976 --> 00:02:45,491
His name is Richard Blaney.
He's a right bastard.

41
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:50,396
Are you quite certain it's the same man?

42
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,354
Gone off with your barmaid?
What exactly do you mean by gone off?

43
00:02:53,528 --> 00:02:55,789
She's been out all night with him
and hasn't yet returned.

44
00:02:55,963 --> 00:03:00,417
I felt it my duty to tell you that
I consider her to be in great danger.

45
00:03:00,591 --> 00:03:02,122
That is, of course,
if she's still alive and kicking.

46
00:03:02,296 --> 00:03:04,349
Thank you for your information, Mr Forsythe.

47
00:03:04,557 --> 00:03:08,071
Tell me, what does this
barmaid of yours look like?

48
00:03:13,464 --> 00:03:17,779
I can set your mind at rest.
She was alive at 8:00 this morning.

49
00:03:17,918 --> 00:03:20,006
8:00 this morning?

50
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,893
Well, where is she now? We opened at 11:00!

51
00:03:23,067 --> 00:03:27,277
But is she coming back here or not?
She's left all her clothes!

52
00:03:27,451 --> 00:03:29,226
I expect she'll turn up.

53
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,636
Today, ladies abandon their honour
more readily than their clothes.

54
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:36,498
Thank you for your information,
Mr Forsythe. I'll send someone over.

55
00:03:36,672 --> 00:03:40,429
That was Forsythe, manager of
the Globe Pub, Covent Garden.

56
00:03:46,553 --> 00:03:49,302
I tell you what, Jim,
I'm glad I'm not in the potato business.

57
00:03:49,476 --> 00:03:52,990
- Got enough troubles of me own.
- You're not a bad judge, Bob.

58
00:03:53,164 --> 00:03:55,669
The potato business is poison, always was.

59
00:03:55,843 --> 00:03:59,044
It costs a fortune to dig 'em up,
another fortune to transport them.

60
00:03:59,218 --> 00:04:02,627
<i>And what do you have at the end?</i>
<i>Hardly any money for them.</i>

61
00:04:02,801 --> 00:04:04,471
Mostly you can't sell them.

62
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:07,498
I've got to send a truckload
back up to Lincolnshire tonight.

63
00:04:07,638 --> 00:04:11,221
And what will they do with them?
They'll plow them back in.

64
00:04:11,395 --> 00:04:13,065
<i>(Jim) Can you beat it?</i>

65
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:14,909
<i>And they say</i>
<i>there's people hungry in this world.</i>

66
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:17,658
<i>True, Jim.</i>
<i>And there are a few thirsty as well.</i>

67
00:04:17,832 --> 00:04:20,302
<i>Come on, have one with your Uncle Bob.</i>

68
00:04:22,494 --> 00:04:24,373
<i>Good afternoon!</i>

69
00:04:24,547 --> 00:04:28,757
Where do you think you've been?
Your half-day was yesterday!

70
00:04:28,931 --> 00:04:32,515
You took a hell of a chance,
spending the night with a murderer.

71
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,707
- How do you know what I did?
- Now come off it.

72
00:04:34,881 --> 00:04:36,934
You took his clothes.
You didn't come home. It stands to reason.

73
00:04:37,108 --> 00:04:40,483
- Mind your own bleeding business!
- Don't talk to me like that!

74
00:04:40,657 --> 00:04:44,553
I was worried you might be next.
I even phoned the police.

75
00:04:44,727 --> 00:04:45,771
- Police?
- Yeah. They wanna talk to you.

76
00:04:45,945 --> 00:04:48,102
- They're sending a fella over.
- Why?

77
00:04:48,276 --> 00:04:49,564
Why? Because they want your lover.

78
00:04:49,738 --> 00:04:53,008
They wanna put him where he can't
strangle any more women!

79
00:04:53,182 --> 00:04:55,861
And you'd better help 'em.
The sooner he's behind bars the better.

80
00:04:56,035 --> 00:04:57,705
Don't you talk about him like that!

81
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:00,558
You don't realise how lucky
you are to be alive!

82
00:05:00,732 --> 00:05:04,455
Christ Almighty, Babs, if I wasn't
shorthanded, I'd take you myself!

83
00:05:04,629 --> 00:05:07,795
- As it is, right after closing time -
- I won't be here!

84
00:05:07,969 --> 00:05:09,048
<i>You can stuff your rotten job</i>
<i>right up your jacksie!</i>

85
00:05:09,117 --> 00:05:10,335
<i>- Come back, you!</i>
- Oh, balls!

86
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,251
Got a place to stay?

87
00:05:20,425 --> 00:05:23,452
<i>- Oh, it's you, Bob.</i>
- Yeah.

88
00:05:23,591 --> 00:05:26,792
- I heard you argue with Forsythe.
- Oh, he's a right bastard.

89
00:05:26,966 --> 00:05:29,054
Of course he is.

90
00:05:35,734 --> 00:05:39,875
You can stay at my place 'til you get
something sorted out... if you want.

91
00:05:40,049 --> 00:05:42,623
I won't be in your way.
I'm going up north for a few days.

92
00:05:42,797 --> 00:05:45,720
- No strings?
- Do I look like that sort of a bloke?

93
00:05:45,894 --> 00:05:49,234
All blokes are that sort of a bloke.

94
00:05:49,408 --> 00:05:52,087
- Are you really goin' away?
- Sure! Tonight.

95
00:05:52,261 --> 00:05:55,219
You can have the place to yourself.
I'll take you there now.

96
00:05:55,393 --> 00:05:58,106
If you like, I'll go back to the Globe
and pick up your stuff for you.

97
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,403
Now, I can't say fairer than that, can I?

98
00:06:00,577 --> 00:06:03,465
Oh, thanks, Bob. I'll just stay
the one night if you don't mind.

99
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:06,770
- Suit yourself
- Tomorrow, I'm gonna go to, um...

100
00:06:06,944 --> 00:06:09,693
I'm going to my sister in Southall.

101
00:06:09,867 --> 00:06:11,745
Leaving your boyfriend
in the lurch a bit, aren't you?

102
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,077
He has to make up
his own mind what to do.

103
00:06:14,251 --> 00:06:17,417
I'd like to help him if I could.
Where's he hiding out?

104
00:06:17,591 --> 00:06:19,713
- Can't tell you, Bob. I promised.
- Ohh!

105
00:06:19,887 --> 00:06:23,332
Come on, Babs. Dick and me have
always been mates. You know that.

106
00:06:23,506 --> 00:06:25,210
I can't.

107
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:29,316
Alright. Keep your little secret.

108
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:33,978
Changing jobs can be a blessing in disguise.
It gets you out of a rut.

109
00:06:34,152 --> 00:06:37,319
A girl like you ought to travel,
see the world a bit.

110
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:40,763
The Cape, California, Jaffa.
Where the fruit comes from,

111
00:06:40,937 --> 00:06:43,303
that's where I'd like to go
if I wasn't tied down here.

112
00:06:43,477 --> 00:06:45,808
But you, you can do as you please!

113
00:06:45,982 --> 00:06:49,218
You've got the whole
of your life ahead of you.

114
00:06:51,793 --> 00:06:54,402
Here we are. I'm on the second floor.

115
00:07:13,817 --> 00:07:16,600
I don't know if you know it, Babs,

116
00:07:16,774 --> 00:07:20,045
<i>but you're my type of woman.</i>

117
00:07:55,986 --> 00:07:58,039
<i>(Footsteps, Cars Passing)</i>

118
00:08:23,543 --> 00:08:26,813
<i>- (Mrs Oxford) Is that you, Tim?</i>
- Hello, dear.

119
00:08:26,987 --> 00:08:29,771
<i>- Hungry?</i>
- Yes!

120
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:32,728
Good. I'll bring it right in.

121
00:08:35,129 --> 00:08:38,295
It's a soupe de poisson, dear.

122
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:41,809
<i>- l know you'll enjoy it.</i>
- I have no doubt of it.

123
00:08:42,366 --> 00:08:45,462
Don't wait for me. I'm just going
to see to the next course.

124
00:08:49,116 --> 00:08:53,952
Well... what's new in the case?
Any sensational breaks?

125
00:08:54,126 --> 00:08:59,032
No. I'll be glad when we get
Mr Richard Blaney inside, though.

126
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:01,989
Any idea where he is?

127
00:09:04,112 --> 00:09:07,313
No, our only lead to him
left her job this morning.

128
00:09:07,521 --> 00:09:11,905
<i>- l don't know where she is either.</i>
- You're certain he's the one?

129
00:09:12,079 --> 00:09:14,584
Oh, yes, he's... the one, alright.

130
00:09:14,758 --> 00:09:16,881
There's not even the complication
of another suspect.

131
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:19,142
<i>It has to be him.</i>

132
00:09:24,257 --> 00:09:27,214
We have him identified as leaving
the matrimonial agency

133
00:09:27,388 --> 00:09:30,102
at the time his ex was killed.

134
00:09:30,276 --> 00:09:34,625
We have the clothes which he sent
off to the cleaners in a hurry.

135
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:37,548
And we have the evidence of the face powder

136
00:09:37,687 --> 00:09:39,079
and the Salvation Army hostel.

137
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,758
I don't follow you, my dear.

138
00:09:41,932 --> 00:09:44,820
I didn't think the Salvation Army
girls used makeup.

139
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:50,630
No, Blaney slept in a Salvation Army
hostel the night before last.

140
00:09:50,804 --> 00:09:52,892
<i>- Did he, dear?</i>
- Yes.

141
00:09:56,058 --> 00:09:59,016
He was incautious enough
to tell them his name.

142
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:01,660
I don't think an ex-RAF officer
would sleep in such a place

143
00:10:01,869 --> 00:10:04,965
- unless he was broke, do you?
<i>- No, l don't.</i>

144
00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:08,027
So, let's assume he was.

145
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:12,237
Last night, however, he slept in the...

146
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:13,907
Coburg Hotel in Bayswater,

147
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:18,778
and paid for his extremely expensive
room with a ten-pound note.

148
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:22,710
The note bore traces
of Mrs Blaney's face powder.

149
00:10:22,884 --> 00:10:25,841
I mean, the murderer
not only strangled Mrs Blaney,

150
00:10:26,015 --> 00:10:28,068
he stole money from her handbag as well.

151
00:10:28,242 --> 00:10:33,426
Ergo... Blaney is the thief
and also the murderer.

152
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,314
That ties it up then.

153
00:10:36,488 --> 00:10:39,063
Well, I think so.

154
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,820
And furthermore, there is a waitress

155
00:10:42,994 --> 00:10:45,117
at Mrs Blaney's club who can also testify

156
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:48,526
to Blaney's aggressive behaviour
towards his wife the previous night.

157
00:10:49,953 --> 00:10:52,562
He doesn't seem to have been
very discreet, does he?

158
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:56,425
No. Discretion is not traditionally
the strong suit of the psychopath.

159
00:10:56,633 --> 00:10:58,338
Believe me, that's what we're dealing with.

160
00:10:58,512 --> 00:11:01,156
You ought to read his wife's divorce...
petition.

161
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:03,244
What exactly is in this soup?

162
00:11:03,418 --> 00:11:05,506
Why? Don't you like it?

163
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,342
Mmm! It's delicious.

164
00:11:10,516 --> 00:11:12,047
But I find the...

165
00:11:12,221 --> 00:11:15,596
ingredients somewhat mystifying.

166
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:18,379
They're smelts, ling,

167
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:20,919
conger eel, John Dory,

168
00:11:21,093 --> 00:11:24,294
pilchards and frog fish.

169
00:11:25,442 --> 00:11:27,808
Now, since that must've been
fairly satisfying,

170
00:11:27,982 --> 00:11:32,018
I thought a simple
roast bird would be enough.

171
00:11:36,402 --> 00:11:38,803
<i>Caille aux raisins.</i>

172
00:11:39,568 --> 00:11:40,612
Hmm?

173
00:11:40,995 --> 00:11:45,240
Quail with... grapes.

174
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:47,501
Ahh!

175
00:11:51,328 --> 00:11:54,773
- I must say, I'm very worried.
- About Mr Blaney?

176
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:58,357
<i>Yes. He's gone off with a barmaid</i>
<i>he used to work with.</i>

177
00:11:58,531 --> 00:12:01,766
<i>l think she's in very great danger.</i>

178
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:05,107
You're wrong, Tim. Absolutely wrong.

179

<i>How long did you say he was married?</i>

181
00:12:09,699 --> 00:12:11,648
Ten years.

182
00:12:11,822 --> 00:12:13,770
Well... there you are.

183
00:12:13,944 --> 00:12:18,119

184

It's true, Dicko. It just came over on the radio.

They found her in a potato truck
in Lincolnshire.

233
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,594
The fellow at the pub
where you worked identified her.

00:27:09,768 --> 00:27:12,586
He knows where they found her.
He put her there!

What are you talking about?
I haven't left this room all night.

Liar. I don't believe you.

It doesn't matter whether
you believe him or not,

238
00:27:19,649 --> 00:27:22,503
because it said on the radio she had
been dead for at least 12 hours

239
00:27:22,676 --> 00:27:24,590
when they found her at 3:00 this morning.

240
00:27:24,764 --> 00:27:28,139
She must've been killed
before 3:00 yesterday afternoon.

241
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,714
Dick was with us from the time
she left to the time we went to bed.

242
00:27:30,923 --> 00:27:33,602
So he couldn't have done it.

- Poor kid.
<i>- (Hetty) l still don't believe it.</i>

244
00:27:36,594 --> 00:27:38,716
They're only guessing when she was killed.

245
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:41,639
We didn't go to bed 'til 11:00,
and Dick was here with us then.

246
00:27:41,778 --> 00:27:45,362
They can't be eight hours adrift. Dicko?

<i>Don't you see? You're in the clear!</i>
<i>We can give you an alibi.</i>

00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:52,808
Yes. Yes, I suppose you can.

249
00:27:52,981 --> 00:27:56,322
There's no supposing. We'll simply
tell the police you were here with us.

250
00:27:56,461 --> 00:27:58,792
Would you do that? Would you do it
now before you go away?

00:27:58,966 --> 00:28:03,767
- Of course I would. Delighted.
- You'll do no such thing!

252
00:28:03,941 --> 00:28:06,133
Not unless you want to go to jail
for harboring a wanted man.

253
00:28:06,307 --> 00:28:08,812
<i>- But he's not a criminal.</i>
<i>- The police think he is!</i>

254
00:28:08,986 --> 00:28:10,378
And they have a lot of evidence against him.

255
00:28:10,517 --> 00:28:13,857
We know he didn't kill her.
We must tell them he was with us.

256
00:28:14,031 --> 00:28:16,397
But we don't know he didn't kill Miss Milligan!

257
00:28:16,571 --> 00:28:19,285
For all we know the time given
on the radio might've been a trap.

258
00:28:19,459 --> 00:28:22,243
<i>What is certain, if you go to the police,</i>

259
00:28:22,417 --> 00:28:25,409
they will probably charge you with
being an accessory after the fact.

260
00:28:25,583 --> 00:28:26,975
And they certainly
won't allow us to go abroad,

261
00:28:27,149 --> 00:28:29,793
and they will probably put us in jail.

262
00:28:37,134 --> 00:28:42,214
Well, Hetty's right, dammit.
You can see that, Dicko, can't you?

263
00:28:42,388 --> 00:28:44,476
You mean you won't come
to the police with me?

276
00:29:18,677 --> 00:29:23,131

came to Paris and worked in a pub,

277
00:29:23,305 --> 00:29:26,471
but they're watching all the ports

Yeah. It makes it very difficult
to give short weight.

283
00:29:48,461 --> 00:29:49,504
I suppose they're trying to find out

284
00:29:49,678 --> 00:29:53,192
if anybody saw Blaney put
Babs on that potato truck.

285
00:29:53,332 --> 00:29:56,393
- You think he did it, do you?
- It stands to reason, doesn't it?

286
00:29:56,567 --> 00:29:57,576
Why? Don't you?

287
00:29:57,785 --> 00:30:00,638

to turn on my old mates.

288
00:30:00,812 --> 00:30:03,422

Blaney wasn't a mate of mine.

289

- Get off.

290
00:30:05,962 --> 00:30:08,710
Yeah, Blaney was a thief, right bastard.

291
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:11,981
I even told that Chief Inspector,
but he didn't believe a word, did he?

292
00:30:12,155 --> 00:30:14,242

on the other side of his face now.

- You reckon?
- Yeah, definitely, definitely.

294
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,470
He wasn't so cocky
when I saw him at 7:00 this morning.

295
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:23,324
I've just been down
to Scotland Yard to identify her.

296
00:30:23,497 --> 00:30:28,369
From photos. They took 'em
and they rushed 'em down special.

297
00:30:28,543 --> 00:30:32,300
- She wasn't a pretty sight.
- Some people have all the luck.

298
00:30:32,474 --> 00:30:34,005
Yeah. I better get a move on.

299
00:30:34,179 --> 00:30:37,519
Business will be pretty brisk today.
You know how morbid people are.

300
00:30:37,693 --> 00:30:41,068
Absolutely! Jumping up to identify
dead girls at all hours of the night.

301
00:30:41,242 --> 00:30:43,295
See you later.

302
00:30:48,688 --> 00:30:50,775
My God, Dick!

303
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,473
Whatcha doin' here?

304
00:30:55,647 --> 00:30:57,943
I'm sorry, Bob,
but I had nowhere else to go.

305
00:30:58,117 --> 00:31:00,587
The people I was staying
with left for Paris this morning.

306
00:31:00,761 --> 00:31:04,449
I wouldn't have come, but you did
say if I needed anything, anytime...

307
00:31:04,623 --> 00:31:08,137
Yes, of course! But you took a hell
of a chance coming here today.

308
00:31:08,311 --> 00:31:11,756
The whole place is teeming with coppers.
Wait a minute.

309
00:31:15,861 --> 00:31:19,897
You'd better hole up in my place for
a day or two 'til we sort something.

310
00:31:20,071 --> 00:31:22,994
Yes. I thought maybe if you had the room.

311
00:31:23,133 --> 00:31:25,952
I know it's a hell of an imposition
getting you involved and everything.

312
00:31:26,125 --> 00:31:29,466
<i>You've got to believe me.</i>
<i>l haven't murdered anyone!</i>

313
00:31:29,674 --> 00:31:32,562
This whole business is insane! You know me.

314
00:31:32,736 --> 00:31:37,120
<i>- l wouldn't do anything like this.</i>
- Of course you wouldn't. No.

315
00:31:37,294 --> 00:31:41,748
The police, as usual, have got
the whole thing arse about face.

316
00:31:41,922 --> 00:31:44,914
I mean, these sort of killings
always boggle the mind.

317
00:31:45,088 --> 00:31:48,498
That man must be a sexual maniac.

318
00:31:49,715 --> 00:31:54,482
Mind you, there are some women
who ask for everything they get.

319
00:31:54,656 --> 00:31:57,857
But you? Don't make me laugh.
You're not the type.

320
00:31:58,031 --> 00:32:00,084
Now... don't worry.

321
00:32:00,258 --> 00:32:04,224
<i>You've done the right thing</i>
<i>coming to your Uncle Bob.</i>

322
00:32:04,398 --> 00:32:07,112
Right. Well, let's get over to
my place. You know where it is?

323
00:32:07,286 --> 00:32:09,687
- Yeah.
- I'll go first, and I'll take the bag.

324
00:32:09,861 --> 00:32:11,948
- Then you'll be less conspicuous .
- OK.

325
00:32:12,122 --> 00:32:14,836
You follow, but go the long way.
Go down to the Strand, you know.

326
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:17,202
And then work your way up
Southampton Street. OK?

327
00:32:17,376 --> 00:32:19,464
Yeah.

328
00:33:42,028 --> 00:33:44,847
Well done, boy! Come in.

329
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:47,386
Make yourself comfortable.

330
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:51,179
- Very cozy.
- Yes, well, it's my little nest.

331
00:33:51,353 --> 00:33:53,440
You know, my home.

332
00:33:53,614 --> 00:33:55,876
The place where when you have
to go there, they have to take you in.

333
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:59,007
That's what my ol' mum used to say.
You met my mum, didn't you?

334
00:33:59,181 --> 00:34:02,974
- Yes.
<i>- Ah, great old lady.</i>

335
00:34:03,148 --> 00:34:06,592
- I'm off to the shop. See you later!
<i>- Yeah, sure.</i>

336
00:34:06,766 --> 00:34:08,854
There's something to eat in the kitchen.
The booze is here.

337
00:34:09,028 --> 00:34:11,115
<i>So get on with it, right?</i>

338
00:34:11,289 --> 00:34:15,186
Bob, I'm really grateful for all this.
You know that.

339
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,517
<i>l told you, think nothing of it.</i>

340
00:34:17,691 --> 00:34:19,744
Hey, do me a favour, will you?

341
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:23,293
<i>- Keep away from the windows.</i>
- Yes, of course. Sorry.

342
00:34:23,467 --> 00:34:25,242
Ta-ta.

343
00:34:25,416 --> 00:34:27,573
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

344
00:34:57,425 --> 00:34:59,478
<i>(Door Opens)</i>

345
00:34:59,652 --> 00:35:01,322
Are you Richard Ian Blaney?

346
00:35:01,496 --> 00:35:03,584
- Yes. What is this?
- You're under arrest.

347
00:35:03,758 --> 00:35:04,802
Come quietly, and you won't get hurt.

348
00:35:04,976 --> 00:35:07,585
- Is this necessary?
- We're careful with you bastards.

349
00:35:07,759 --> 00:35:09,394
- Is this your bag?
- Yes.

350
00:35:25,782 --> 00:35:29,957
-Thank you for your help, Mr Rusk.
- Anything to oblige, Sarge.

351
00:35:30,131 --> 00:35:32,741
No reward, I'm afraid.
Better luck next time, eh?

352
00:35:32,915 --> 00:35:35,907
You know what they say.
Virtue is its own reward.

353
00:35:36,081 --> 00:35:40,152
I... Well, if you want any more help,
I'll be in my shop.

354
00:35:40,326 --> 00:35:42,170
Alright. We know where you are.

355
00:35:47,806 --> 00:35:51,425
How's that kid of yours
gettin' on with the violin?

356
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:01,341
- Richard Ian Blaney?
- Yes.

357
00:36:01,515 --> 00:36:04,403
As the result of my inquiries,
you'll be detained in connection

358
00:36:04,577 --> 00:36:06,803
with the willful murders
of Brenda Margaret Blaney,

359
00:36:06,977 --> 00:36:09,448
Barbara Jane Milligan and others.

360
00:36:09,622 --> 00:36:11,431
You're not obliged to say anything
unless you wish.

361
00:36:11,605 --> 00:36:13,762
Anything you do say will be
taken down in writing

362
00:36:13,971 --> 00:36:15,328
and may be used in evidence.

363
00:36:15,502 --> 00:36:18,911
Mr Oxford, could you
spare a second over here?

364
00:36:26,218 --> 00:36:28,723
Rusk. It's Rusk!

365
00:36:28,897 --> 00:36:31,298
Hold him back. Where was this found?

366
00:36:31,472 --> 00:36:35,229
- Over at Henrietta Street.
- Any identification?

367
00:36:39,161 --> 00:36:41,527
Miss Barbara Milligan, Globe Public House.

368
00:36:41,701 --> 00:36:44,345
Covent Garden, London, WC2.

369
00:36:53,357 --> 00:36:55,444
(Clerk) Are you agreed upon your verdict?

370
00:36:55,618 --> 00:36:56,732
We are.

371
00:36:56,906 --> 00:36:59,306
Do you find the prisoner, Richard Ian Blaney,

372
00:36:59,515 --> 00:37:01,812
guilty or not guilty of the murder of Brenda...
(Fades Out)

373
00:37:19,974 --> 00:37:21,018
<i>...lan Blaney,</i>

374
00:37:21,191 --> 00:37:24,114
you have been found guilty
of a terrible crime.

375
00:37:24,288 --> 00:37:27,872
On its ghastly and wicked
nature I will not dwell.

376
00:37:28,046 --> 00:37:31,282
I only tell you that you must
entertain no expectation or hope

377
00:37:31,456 --> 00:37:34,865
that you will escape the consequences of it.

378
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:39,667
The sentence of this court is that you
serve a term of life imprisonment,

379
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:42,624
<i>for not less than 25 years.</i>

380
00:37:47,252 --> 00:37:50,209
(Blaney's Muffled Voice)
Rusk did it! I told you all along!

381
00:37:50,383 --> 00:37:51,427
<i>Rusk!</i>

382
00:37:51,601 --> 00:37:56,681
I keep telling you. Rusk, where are you?

383
00:37:56,855 --> 00:37:59,569
One of these days, you bastard!

384
00:37:59,743 --> 00:38:02,491
<i>Rusk, where are you? Rusk?</i>

385
00:38:02,665 --> 00:38:05,692
One of these days, I'm gonna get out
and kill you, you bastard!

386
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:07,606
I've got nothing to lose now!

387
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:10,285
I might as well do
what I'm being locked away for!

388
00:38:10,459 --> 00:38:12,929
You remember that! You remember that!

389
00:38:18,287 --> 00:38:20,375
<i>(Door Locks)</i>

390
00:38:40,242 --> 00:38:42,643
<i>(Blaney's Voice) Rusk did it.</i>

391
00:38:42,817 --> 00:38:46,261
<i>Rusk did it. I've told you all along!</i>

392
00:38:46,435 --> 00:38:49,288
<i>Rusk? Rusk, where are you?</i>

393
00:38:49,462 --> 00:38:52,802
<i>One of these days I’m gonna get out</i>
<i>and kill you, you bastard!</i>

394
00:38:53,011 --> 00:38:54,403
<i>I’ve got nothing to lose now.</i>

395
00:38:54,577 --> 00:38:57,430
<i>l might as well do what I’m being</i>
<i>put away for.</i>

396
00:38:57,569 --> 00:39:00,944
<i>You remember that! You remember that!</i>

397
00:39:13,087 --> 00:39:14,896
- Do you see the sign, Hartletts?
- Yes, sir.

398
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:18,549
<i>(Oxford) It’s the fair-haired chap</i>
<i>in the brown suit underneath it.</i>

399
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:20,115
- Did you see him?
- Yes, I did.

400
00:39:20,289 --> 00:39:24,116
We'll go around once again,
and I want a good, close mug shot.

401
00:39:24,986 --> 00:39:26,448
(Monica) Yes, Inspector, I remember him well.

402
00:39:26,621 --> 00:39:28,674
He came here on two or three occasions.

403
00:39:28,883 --> 00:39:32,328
Every business has its own
special cross to bear, I suppose.

404
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:35,285
- And yours is men like this?
- That is so.

405
00:39:35,459 --> 00:39:38,799
Most of them are easy enough to get
rid of, but Mr Robinson here

406
00:39:38,973 --> 00:39:40,504
<i>was particularly insistent.</i>

407
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:43,635
<i>- He wouldn't take no for an answer.</i>
- Mr Robinson?

408
00:39:43,809 --> 00:39:45,862
Yes, that is the man's name.

409
00:39:53,273 --> 00:39:54,526
<i>Here we are.</i>

410
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:57,866
Mr William Robinson.

411
00:39:58,005 --> 00:40:02,598
You see, Inspector, he wanted us to
find women for him who enjoyed,

412
00:40:02,772 --> 00:40:05,799
well... certain peculiarities.

413
00:40:05,973 --> 00:40:09,522
Who were sexual masochists?
Who enjoyed being hurt?

414
00:40:09,696 --> 00:40:12,236
<i>- That sort of thing?</i>
- Quite.

415
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,671
Perhaps you'd better see it for yourself.

416
00:40:14,845 --> 00:40:19,647
Naturally we told him we couldn't oblige,
but he kept coming back.

417
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:20,934
Is it likely, do you think,

418
00:40:21,143 --> 00:40:24,657
that if Mr Robinson couldn't get
what he wanted from your agency,

419
00:40:24,831 --> 00:40:28,101
<i>- he would go to others?</i>
- Oh, yes, very likely.

420
00:40:28,275 --> 00:40:30,641
Men like this leave no stone unturned

421
00:40:30,815 --> 00:40:33,425
in their search for their
disgusting gratifications.

422
00:40:38,017 --> 00:40:39,757
Excuse me, Inspector.

423
00:40:39,931 --> 00:40:43,236
Do you have any special reason
for seeing Mr Robinson?

424
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:48,316
Yes, Miss Barling. And I'd like you
to keep my visit confidential.

425
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:50,578
Of course.

426
00:41:08,148 --> 00:41:11,628
<i>(Guard) Get the doctor quick.</i>
<i>Looks like an ambulance job.</i>

427
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:13,889
(Sirens Wailing)

428
00:41:37,514 --> 00:41:40,924
I told you it wasn't Blaney, didn't I?

429
00:41:41,098 --> 00:41:44,160
I told you you were on the wrong track.

430
00:41:44,333 --> 00:41:48,265
A woman's intuition is worth more
than all those laboratories.

431
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:51,292
I can't think why you don't
teach it in police colleges.

432
00:41:51,466 --> 00:41:54,215
So you think it's Rusk, do you?
You think he's our man?

433
00:41:54,389 --> 00:41:56,894
Well, of course. Anyone can see that.

434
00:41:57,068 --> 00:41:59,399
He knew both Mrs Blaney

435
00:41:59,573 --> 00:42:02,322
- and that Barbara what's-her-name.
- Yes.

436
00:42:02,496 --> 00:42:04,548
Well, there you are.

437
00:42:04,722 --> 00:42:06,984
You told me the man's a sexual pervert.

438
00:42:07,158 --> 00:42:10,429
That's why he kept the clothes
and put them in Mr Blaney's case.

439
00:42:10,602 --> 00:42:12,690
We have no proof of that.

440
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:15,334
It stands to reason.

441
00:42:15,508 --> 00:42:17,561
Don't you mean intuition?

442
00:42:18,918 --> 00:42:22,154
What does your intuition tell you
I want for dinner tonight?

443
00:42:22,328 --> 00:42:24,833
Steak and a baked potato.

444
00:42:25,007 --> 00:42:30,400
But you're getting
pied de porc â la mode de Caens.

445
00:42:31,583 --> 00:42:34,123
<i>- (Oxford) It looks like a pig's foot!</i>
<i>- That's what it is.</i>

446
00:42:34,297 --> 00:42:38,402
I put it in the same sauce
the French use for tripe.

447
00:42:38,576 --> 00:42:40,629
That's comforting.

448
00:42:40,803 --> 00:42:43,030
Well, when are you going to arrest

449
00:42:43,204 --> 00:42:46,544
this Mr Robinson, or Rusk,
or whatever he's called?

450
00:42:46,683 --> 00:42:48,353
<i>When l have the proof l need.</i>

451
00:42:48,527 --> 00:42:53,572
<i>- It takes longer than intuition.</i>
<i>- When will you have it?</i>

452
00:42:54,233 --> 00:42:56,390
In a few minutes I hope, dear.

453
00:42:56,599 --> 00:42:58,826
Really?

454
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,888
You old slyboots. Tell.

455
00:43:03,871 --> 00:43:06,307
Well...

456
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:15,005
we know that if Rusk is the murderer,

457
00:43:15,179 --> 00:43:17,893
he traveled up in a potato truck
with his victim.

458
00:43:18,067 --> 00:43:19,876
How do we know that?

459
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:23,912
Did you ever hear of a corpse
that cut itself out of a tied sack?

460
00:43:24,086 --> 00:43:27,739
<i>What would he want to take</i>
<i>the corpse out of the sack for?</i>

461
00:43:27,913 --> 00:43:30,001
Obviously he was looking for something.

462
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:32,471
How do we know that?

463
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,872
The corpse was deep in rigor mortis.

464
00:43:35,046 --> 00:43:38,664
He had to break the fingers of the
right hand to obtain what they held.

465
00:43:38,838 --> 00:43:40,926
(Cracking)

466
00:43:42,979 --> 00:43:45,936
It would be so nice to get back
to plain bread in this house.

467
00:43:46,110 --> 00:43:48,372
What do you think they held?

468
00:43:48,546 --> 00:43:51,851
A locket? A broach? A cross!

469
00:43:52,025 --> 00:43:54,982
It had to be something
that would incriminate him.

470
00:43:55,156 --> 00:43:58,079
Something that he missed
when he put the body on the truck.

471
00:43:58,218 --> 00:44:00,723
A monogrammed handkerchief, perhaps.

472
00:44:00,897 --> 00:44:02,985
Not a cross, I think.

473
00:44:03,159 --> 00:44:05,699
Well...

474
00:44:05,873 --> 00:44:08,169
I don't see why not.

475
00:44:08,308 --> 00:44:13,562
Religious and sexual mania are closely linked.

476
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:18,329
Anyway, whatever it was, he found it,

477
00:44:18,503 --> 00:44:20,834
which was unlucky for us.

478
00:44:21,008 --> 00:44:25,044
But we did have one piece of good fortune.

479
00:44:25,218 --> 00:44:29,950
The truck driver told us that he
stopped at one place on his journey,

480
00:44:30,124 --> 00:44:33,429
and that was at a pull-in
somewhere out of London.

481
00:44:33,603 --> 00:44:35,238
- A pull-in?
- Hmm.

482
00:44:36,491 --> 00:44:41,118
It's a... cafe frequented by truck drivers, dear.

483
00:44:41,292 --> 00:44:44,807
They serve humble foods
like bacon and egg sandwiches,

484
00:44:44,981 --> 00:44:49,643
sausages and mashed potatoes
and cups of tea and coffee.

485
00:44:51,035 --> 00:44:53,714
How is it so fortunate
that this driver stopped there?

486
00:44:55,419 --> 00:44:57,123
It's not so much that he stopped,

487
00:44:57,297 --> 00:45:00,672
but that he stopped
only once that is important.

488
00:45:00,846 --> 00:45:03,908
The only place our man could've
got out of the truck was at that cafe.

489
00:45:04,082 --> 00:45:05,752
I sent Sergeant Spearman to see

490
00:45:05,926 --> 00:45:09,057
if he could find anyone who
could remember Rusk being there.

491
00:45:09,231 --> 00:45:12,050
I'm expecting him back at any minute.

492
00:45:12,224 --> 00:45:15,494
Well, eat up, dear. You'll want
to be finished by the time he arrives.

493
00:45:16,468 --> 00:45:19,008
Tasty, very tasty.

494
00:45:19,182 --> 00:45:21,653
Not a lot of meat on it, mind.

495
00:45:21,827 --> 00:45:23,427
No sense in gorging, dear.

496
00:45:23,601 --> 00:45:28,159
I'll take mine and eat it while I'm
beating my eggs for the soufflé.

497
00:45:28,333 --> 00:45:30,386
<i>(Doorbell Rings)</i>

498
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:35,292
- Good evening, Sergeant.
- Good evening, sir.

499
00:45:35,466 --> 00:45:38,040
- Am I interrupting your dinner?
- No, not at all. Come in.

500
00:45:38,214 --> 00:45:40,824
- Thank you, sir.
- Put your hat and coat on the sofa.

501
00:45:43,607 --> 00:45:47,365
Good evening, Sergeant Spearman.
What would you like to drink?

502
00:45:47,539 --> 00:45:49,940
Good evening, madam. I don't know that I...

503
00:45:50,114 --> 00:45:51,819
Oh, that's alright. You're off duty.

504
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:56,376
How about a Margarita? It's delicious.

505
00:45:56,550 --> 00:45:58,673
Tequila, triple sec,

506
00:45:58,847 --> 00:46:04,309
<i>fresh lemon juice and... salt</i>
<i>pressed 'round the rim of the glass.</i>

507
00:46:04,483 --> 00:46:06,954
<i>- You'll love it.</i>
- Thank you, madam.

508
00:46:10,990 --> 00:46:14,191
Sergeant Spearman, you are positively
glutinous with self-approbation.

509
00:46:14,365 --> 00:46:16,626
- You might as well speak out.
- Yes, sir.

510
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,853
The woman behind the counter at the cafe

511
00:46:19,062 --> 00:46:21,845
positively identified Rusk
from the photo I showed her

512
00:46:22,019 --> 00:46:25,116
as being a man who was at the cafe
the night the body was discovered.

513
00:46:25,290 --> 00:46:27,099
And that's not all.

514
00:46:27,273 --> 00:46:31,622
- Are you waiting for a drumroll?
- No, sir. Sorry, sir.

515
00:46:31,796 --> 00:46:34,997
The woman also said that Rusk was
dishevelled and very dusty,

516
00:46:35,171 --> 00:46:38,476
and asked to borrow a clothes brush.

517
00:46:45,957 --> 00:46:48,184
This is the brush she lent him, sir.

518
00:46:48,358 --> 00:46:52,742
- You see there?
- (Sniffs)

519
00:46:52,916 --> 00:46:56,186
What do you say, Spearman? Potato dust?

520
00:46:57,404 --> 00:46:59,944
Here you are, Sergeant.

521
00:47:01,162 --> 00:47:02,762
Cheers.

522
00:47:02,936 --> 00:47:06,276
- Cheers, madam.
- Did you hear all that?

523
00:47:06,485 --> 00:47:10,869
<i>- Yes, l told you. l knew all the time.</i>
- (Oxford) Quite.

524
00:47:11,043 --> 00:47:14,522
- Get this down to the lab quickly.
- Very good, sir.

525
00:47:15,566 --> 00:47:18,350
It rather looks like we put
the wrong man away this time.

526
00:47:18,524 --> 00:47:22,386
What do you mean we? You put him away.

527
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:25,413
- All right, Spearman, you can go.
- Good night, madam.

528
00:47:25,587 --> 00:47:26,943
You haven't finished your drink.

529
00:47:27,117 --> 00:47:30,318
I'm sorry. I have to get
down to the lab in a hurry.

530
00:47:30,492 --> 00:47:32,580
Good night, Spearman. Good work.

531
00:47:32,754 --> 00:47:34,807
- Very good work.
- Thank you, sir.

532
00:47:40,478 --> 00:47:45,210
Poor Mr Blaney. You've got
to get him out, Tim, immediately.

533
00:47:45,384 --> 00:47:47,576
He's in hospital at the moment.

534
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:50,394
I'll talk to the assistant
commissioner in the morning

535
00:47:50,568 --> 00:47:51,925
and get the case reopened.

536
00:47:52,099 --> 00:47:55,613
He won't like it, but there's
quite enough evidence for a pardon.

537
00:47:55,787 --> 00:47:58,188
Will they give him any compensation?

538
00:47:58,362 --> 00:47:59,440
I expect they'll give him some money,

539
00:47:59,614 --> 00:48:03,685
but there's no real way
to compensate in cases like these.

540
00:48:03,859 --> 00:48:05,947
Poor man.

541
00:48:07,339 --> 00:48:12,036
I think the least you can do is ask
him 'round for a really good dinner.

542
00:48:12,836 --> 00:48:14,193
<i>Let's see.</i>

543
00:48:14,367 --> 00:48:17,533
<i>It will obviously have</i>
<i>to be something substantial.</i>

544
00:48:18,333 --> 00:48:23,448
I think a Caneton aux cerises.

545
00:48:24,457 --> 00:48:26,440
- What's that?
<i>- Duckling...</i>

546
00:48:26,579 --> 00:48:29,676
with heavy sweet cherry sauce.

547
00:48:31,311 --> 00:48:35,730
After that jail food he's been having,
I expect he'll eat anything.

548
00:48:42,375 --> 00:48:43,906
Excuse me.

549
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:47,316
I must see if my soufflé's started to rise.

550
00:49:15,847 --> 00:49:18,839
Hey! Are the pills working?

551
00:49:27,816 --> 00:49:30,460
- He's sleeping like a baby.
- Do you think we gave him enough?

552
00:49:31,747 --> 00:49:33,243
Christ, mate, he's had half a dozen.

553
00:49:34,879 --> 00:49:37,592
Good. Now I'm off to get that bastard Rusk!

554
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:39,784
Alright, alright. Let's make sure.

555
00:49:39,958 --> 00:49:42,916
It's now or never!
I'm due back inside tomorrow.

556
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:44,760
George? George!

557
00:49:44,934 --> 00:49:47,335
<i>Alright, George?</i>

558
00:50:14,508 --> 00:50:17,883
Right, son, better be going.
Mind you do him up good.

559
00:50:18,057 --> 00:50:19,971
Here, take this strip of mica.

560
00:50:20,145 --> 00:50:23,137
You may need it to open his door.

Doctor? Sister?

563
00:50:56,365 --> 00:50:58,000
Get a trolley, nurse.

564
00:51:05,411 --> 00:51:08,577
(Doctor) Sister, there seems to be
no evidence of a cerebral accident.

<i>We'll have to admit him for observation</i>
<i>and then sort him out.</i>

<i>(Nurse) Could he be an epileptic or diabetic?</i>

567
00:51:13,761 --> 00:51:16,023
<i>(Doctor) Not very likely in his sort of job.</i>

568
00:51:16,197 --> 00:51:18,980
<i>We're certainly going to need blood samples.</i>

<i>Sleeping pills!</i>
<i>They've given him all their sleeping pills.</i>

Right. What's that?

Yes. Five minutes. I'll wait outside.

I'm off! Blaney's escaped,
and I bet I know where he's gone.

580
00:53:20,513 --> 00:53:23,401
I often wondered whether Blaney
threw himself down those stairs

in a suicide attempt,
or just as a means to get into the hospital.
