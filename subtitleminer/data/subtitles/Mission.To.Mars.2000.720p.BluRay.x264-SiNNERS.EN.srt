00:00:40,008 --> 00:00:44,758
T-minus ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five...

2
00:00:44,926 --> 00:00:50,259
four, three, two, one, zero.

3
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,383
Ignition.

4
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,298
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,
fiive, four, three, two, one!

5
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:08,341
- Blast off!
- Guys, guys, please, wait! Please!

6
00:01:08,508 --> 00:01:11,633
This is very risky stuff here, and I'm a
highly trained professional astronaut.

7
00:01:11,798 --> 00:01:14,881
- Here you go.
- Now, Uncle Phil will launch another rocket...

8
00:01:15,048 --> 00:01:17,715
just as soon as he completes his fuel intake.

9
00:01:17,841 --> 00:01:19,966
Thanks, darlin'.

10
00:01:20,134 --> 00:01:23,758
Now, you know, it takes six
months just to reach Mars.

11
00:01:23,925 --> 00:01:29,383
Then a year on the surface, six months
back. It's, like, two years, you know?

12
00:01:29,548 --> 00:01:33,465
Anyway, guess what I'm tryin' to
say here is that, um...

13
00:01:33,631 --> 00:01:37,298
you know, this bein' my last night
on Earth and everything...

14
00:01:37,465 --> 00:01:42,048
this could be a very, uh, precious memory for me.

15
00:01:42,216 --> 00:01:44,757
Nice try.

16
00:01:44,925 --> 00:01:46,883
- William, get that thing out of your nose.
- But I like it.

17
00:01:47,049 --> 00:01:49,465
- Don't you talk back to Mommy.
- There you are.

18
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:55,715
- Hey, Woody.
- Yeah?

19
00:01:55,883 --> 00:01:58,091
Our Mars One crew won't be
heading back to Earth...

20
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:01,717
till ten days after you guys land at
our base camp with Mars Two.

21
00:02:01,882 --> 00:02:03,382
- Uh-huh.
- Oh, thank you, Renee.

22
00:02:03,549 --> 00:02:04,965
That's a pretty good long
rendezvous, don't you think?

23
00:02:05,131 --> 00:02:09,339
- What are you suggesting, Sergei?
- I think maybe you should bring a baseball bat.

24
00:02:09,507 --> 00:02:13,215
- Yes, we will play American
baseball on Mars, our two crews.
- Oh, please.

25
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:16,175
- We could have ourselves a
little solar system series.
- Half you guys are foreigners.

26
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,882
- We'd crush you.
- No, no, no, because we have equal crews.

27
00:02:19,047 --> 00:02:21,381
We have three men, one woman. Same handicap.

28
00:02:21,548 --> 00:02:23,632
Easy now. That's my wife you're talking about...

29
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,216
and Terri just happens to be
one hell of a shortstop.

30
00:02:27,923 --> 00:02:30,715
Fast pitch, no steals, batter
calls his own strikes.

31
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,005
- Thousand bucks make it interesting?
- Oh, winner take all.

32
00:02:34,172 --> 00:02:36,547
Good. You bring the balls.

33
00:02:36,714 --> 00:02:38,839
You know the best thing about our mission?

34
00:02:39,007 --> 00:02:42,048
On Mars Two, technically, I outrank her, so
for the first time in our marriage...

35
00:02:42,215 --> 00:02:45,298
she's gonna have to do
everything I say, right, honey?

36
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:48,007
- Yes, honey.
- Yes, honey, sir...

37
00:02:48,174 --> 00:02:50,508
with a little salute helps.

38
00:02:50,673 --> 00:02:54,506
- Yes, honey, sir.
- Yeah, I like it. It's good.

39
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:57,424
- Take that corn up there, all right?
- Yes, sir.

40
00:02:57,591 --> 00:03:00,632
I'm not sure how I feel about
NASA allowing couples...

41
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,258
to go on this type of mission together.

42
00:03:04,715 --> 00:03:07,756
Well, nothin' personal, Terri. I mean--

43
00:03:07,923 --> 00:03:12,298
It-- It's just that it's, uh--
- It's a funny feelin' for those
of us stayin' behind.

44
00:03:12,465 --> 00:03:15,048
Yes, but you know that all the research
shows that marriage will provide...

45
00:03:15,215 --> 00:03:17,506
stability on these long duration trips.

46
00:03:17,672 --> 00:03:21,380
Then they haven't studied some of
the couples I've known.

47
00:03:21,547 --> 00:03:24,880
Luke. Come on, baby. He's not comin'.

48
00:03:26,507 --> 00:03:29,674
This isn't right. I mean, Jim deserves this too.

49
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,424
- All of his friends are here.
- I know.

50
00:03:31,589 --> 00:03:33,964
- It's my last night here.
- Hey!

51
00:03:34,129 --> 00:03:36,962
It's your last night with us too.

52
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:39,380
- I know. I'm sorry, baby.
- Mm-hmm.

53
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:45,131
- I love you, Deb.
- I love you too.

54
00:03:45,298 --> 00:03:48,131
Maybe you should spend some time with Bobby.

55
00:03:48,298 --> 00:03:50,798
- Yeah, where is he?
- Up in his fort.

56
00:03:50,965 --> 00:03:55,299
- Oh. Okay.
- Millions of miles away.

57
00:03:55,464 --> 00:03:57,797
Deep space.

58
00:03:57,965 --> 00:04:02,590
So lonesome, so cold.

59
00:04:02,757 --> 00:04:04,673
So lame, Nick.

60
00:04:08,796 --> 00:04:11,130
Knock, knock.

61
00:04:13,797 --> 00:04:15,964
Bobby?

62
00:04:17,922 --> 00:04:22,131
Your friends are out there playin'.
What are you doin' up here?

63
00:04:22,297 --> 00:04:26,380
Who's gonna read to me now at bedtime?

64
00:04:26,547 --> 00:04:28,880
Your mother will.

65
00:04:31,172 --> 00:04:34,130
But I like when you do it.

66
00:04:34,297 --> 00:04:38,089
- Now we're never gonna finish our book.
- Bobby.

67
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:42,213
Listen, I've been thinkin' about that too, okay?

68
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,339
And what I figured out was--

69
00:04:44,505 --> 00:04:47,422
How about if I bring along my own copy?

70
00:04:47,589 --> 00:04:51,464
And then every night wherever I am I'll
read a little bit more of it.

71
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:54,464
And you and Mommy, you can read a little
bit more of it wherever you are.

72
00:04:54,631 --> 00:04:57,923
And it'll be kind of like we're
reading it together.

73
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,131
'Cause, hey, I don't know about you,
but I'm kind of anxious...

74
00:05:00,298 --> 00:05:04,839
to find out how old Ben Gunn got
marooned on that island.

75
00:05:05,006 --> 00:05:07,381
- You think that's a good idea?
- Yeah.

76
00:05:07,549 --> 00:05:08,424
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

77
00:05:08,587 --> 00:05:10,504
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

78
00:05:10,672 --> 00:05:12,797
Okay.

79
00:05:27,504 --> 00:05:31,004
Well, we were afraid you wouldn't come.

80
00:05:32,548 --> 00:05:36,756
- I caught a whiff of your barbecue.
- Oh.

81
00:05:36,921 --> 00:05:39,130
- After that--
- Yeah?

82
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:41,381
I was, uh, helpless.

83
00:05:41,545 --> 00:05:44,420
All the way out in Galveston?

84
00:05:44,588 --> 00:05:46,630
- Somethin' like that.
- Mmm!

85
00:05:48,255 --> 00:05:50,796
It's his night, Deb. I didn't want to spoil it.

86
00:05:50,963 --> 00:05:54,296
Spoil it? He has been going crazy lookin' for you.

87
00:05:55,713 --> 00:05:59,505
Don't ever do that to me again.

88
00:05:59,671 --> 00:06:02,713
- How ya doin'?
- Hey. I'm doin' good.

89
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:05,254
- Here.
- Thanks, man.

90
00:06:05,421 --> 00:06:07,504
A lot of people are gonna be mighty
glad to see ya, you know that?

91
00:06:07,672 --> 00:06:11,214
- Yeah.
- Come on. Let's go in.

92
00:06:11,378 --> 00:06:13,462
You remember him?

93
00:06:28,463 --> 00:06:29,963
- Come on.
- Why don't you just let that go?

94
00:06:30,211 --> 00:06:33,253
- As soon as you admit that it
was a no-go situation.
- It was a go situation.

95
00:06:33,421 --> 00:06:35,421
Three months, no data stream, you're
gonna land the ship anyway?

96
00:06:35,589 --> 00:06:37,505
Just because you keep bringing it
up doesn't make you right.

97
00:06:37,671 --> 00:06:39,962
Just because you get loud
doesn't make--Jim, settle it.

98
00:06:40,129 --> 00:06:41,796
- No, no, don't-- Don't look at me.
- Settle it.

99
00:06:41,963 --> 00:06:43,963
- It's a go situation.
- Well, th-- this is exactly
what I'm talkin' about.

100
00:06:44,128 --> 00:06:47,211
- It's hard to admit. I know that.
- Come on. Three commanders. One ship.

101
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:48,879
I don't think that's gonna work.

102
00:06:49,045 --> 00:06:52,545
There's not enough rocket fuel in the world
to get those egos off the ground.

103
00:06:52,711 --> 00:06:57,086
- Come on.
- Ah, we would have made a great crew.

104
00:06:57,254 --> 00:07:01,379
- Maybe. If this man was left seat.
- Yep.

105
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:04,295
Guys, come on. I'm a-- I'm a
pretty good stick jockey.

106
00:07:04,463 --> 00:07:07,838
- You call me if you need a flight test.
- What is a-- What is a stick jockey?

107
00:07:08,004 --> 00:07:10,879
- "l'm a pretty good stick jockey."
- Come on, Mr Cover of Time Magazine.

108
00:07:11,046 --> 00:07:13,255
The guy who landed a crippled Block ll shuttle.

109
00:07:13,422 --> 00:07:15,672
- Yeah. That's the stick jockey.
- The stick jockey did that?

110
00:07:15,837 --> 00:07:17,962
- Yeah, yeah, Mr. stick jockey.
- Okay, all right.

111
00:07:18,128 --> 00:07:20,961
I made a little noise, but putting
the first footprints on Mars?

112
00:07:21,128 --> 00:07:25,211
That's for guys who wrote their Ph.D.
thesis on how to colonize the place...

113
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:30,380
and for guys who read too much
science fiiction as a kid...

114
00:07:30,544 --> 00:07:33,419
- and still wear these little Flash Gordon
rocket ships around their necks.
- Yeah.

115
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:37,336
- Very, very mature.
- Yeah, you read every damn
science fiiction book I did.

116
00:07:37,503 --> 00:07:41,087
And you're just not man enough to wear
jewellery. That's all there is to that.

117
00:07:42,878 --> 00:07:44,795
- Give me it.
- No, no, no.
- Yeah. Take it. Get it.

118
00:07:44,963 --> 00:07:48,588
You know you want Flash here. You
ain't gettin' him! Oh, no!

119
00:07:48,752 --> 00:07:53,502
Yeah, Maggie would have loved to see you
two clowns just one more time.

120
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:12,462
I'm gonna go and get a beer.

121
00:08:20,128 --> 00:08:23,420
I don't know, Woodrow. I think it's about time
you donated this baby to the museum.

122
00:08:23,585 --> 00:08:27,627
Internal combustion, boys. Accept no substitutes.

123
00:08:27,795 --> 00:08:30,128
Jim, listen.

124
00:08:32,004 --> 00:08:34,212
If there's, um--

125
00:08:34,377 --> 00:08:38,585
- If there's anything that Terri and I
can do, you call us, all right?
- I'm okay. I'm okay. Really.

126
00:08:38,753 --> 00:08:39,628
- All right.
- Thanks.

127
00:08:39,794 --> 00:08:41,294
- Luke.
- Yep.

128
00:08:41,462 --> 00:08:45,254
I'll see you when I get to Mars. Listen. Don't solve
all the mysteries of the universe, all right?

129
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,754
- Leave a little somethin' for the next guys.
- I'm not promisin' anything.

130
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,212
- You just bring some expensive beer.
- All right.

131
00:08:50,377 --> 00:08:53,418
- Will do. Godspeed.
- Thanks, buddy.

132
00:09:00,794 --> 00:09:03,544
It should have been your mission, Jim.

133
00:09:03,711 --> 00:09:05,753
Yours and Maggie's.

134
00:09:07,628 --> 00:09:11,211
Nobody ever wanted Mars the way you
two did, not even Woody.

135
00:09:11,377 --> 00:09:14,752
You two were 12 years training for this
thing, hoping for this assignment.

136
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:17,586
- It's--
- Well, that's-- That's all over now.

137
00:09:17,753 --> 00:09:19,670
If Maggie hadn't gotten sick, if you
hadn't pulled yourself...

138
00:09:19,838 --> 00:09:21,754
out of the rotation to take care
of her, I mean, you--

139
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:24,794
- Luke. Come on.
- No, Jim. Wait a minute.

140
00:09:24,961 --> 00:09:27,419
I want to say this.

141
00:09:27,585 --> 00:09:29,751
Look, I wanted this assignment, all right?

142
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:33,962
But not like this, Jim.

143
00:09:35,378 --> 00:09:38,920
I would give all of this up in a second if
it would bring Maggie back to us.

144
00:09:40,418 --> 00:09:43,543
I know that.

145
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:48,252
Look, all the years of training and planning
for this mission have been a privilege.

146
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:52,335
Mars is yours now.

147
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,583
Go get it.

148
00:09:54,751 --> 00:09:57,251
I will.

149
00:09:57,419 --> 00:10:00,377
You take care of yourself, Jim.

150
00:10:02,877 --> 00:10:05,669
You too, buddy.

151
00:10:05,835 --> 00:10:08,502
Okay.

152
00:10:08,669 --> 00:10:11,002
I'll see you when I get back.

153
00:10:12,586 --> 00:10:14,836
Hey, Luke.

154
00:10:16,336 --> 00:10:19,544
Have a great ride.

155
00:10:19,711 --> 00:10:22,794
Always do.

156
00:12:53,835 --> 00:12:56,584
- Luke, do you read me?
- Yeah, Renee.

157
00:12:56,751 --> 00:12:59,084
Luke, l just got ARES-8 on-line, and--

158
00:12:59,251 --> 00:13:03,251
Well, we-- we think you're gonna
want to see this for yourself.

159
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,332
Okay, copy that.

160
00:13:07,082 --> 00:13:09,166
- Now, is this a cinder cone?
- No, it's too smooth.

161
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:12,583
It's, uh, too angular. Volcanic upwelling maybe.

162
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:17,333
- No, no fissure, no caldera.
- No, it's an upwelling for sure,
but maybe not volcanic.

163
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,417
I mean, look at the colour and how shiny
it is. That almost looks like--

164
00:13:21,584 --> 00:13:24,626
- It looks like ice.
- This far south?

165
00:13:24,793 --> 00:13:27,459
Impossible. You can't have ice at this latitude.

166
00:13:27,626 --> 00:13:30,084
I mean, not unless there's like a--

167
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:36,207
- Okay, how far away is that?
- Sixteen kilometres, northeast.

168
00:13:36,374 --> 00:13:38,290
Take us 20 minutes to get there, Chief.

169
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:40,958
Okay, we're gonna send a packet to
Micker. We're going out there.

170
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:43,041
- Keep working.
- Okay.

171
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:58,083
- Careful. Watch your step.
- Yes, sir.

172
00:13:58,249 --> 00:14:00,291
- Is it possible to take picture?
- Oh, picture.

173
00:14:00,459 --> 00:14:03,125
- Come, please.
- Let's have a picture.

174
00:14:03,292 --> 00:14:05,209
Say cheese.

175
00:14:06,998 --> 00:14:08,915
This is a truly anomalous formation.

176
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:11,374
It's unlike anything ever seen so far.

177
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,457
The structure appears to be crystalline...

178
00:14:13,623 --> 00:14:16,082
at least from the angle that's
displayed by ARES-8.

179
00:14:16,249 --> 00:14:20,208
Now, we're trying not togo too nuts up here,
but we think there's a good chance...

180
00:14:20,374 --> 00:14:23,958
that this could be an extrusion from some
subsurface geothermal column of water.

181
00:14:24,124 --> 00:14:26,124
And, of course, if that's correct...

182
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:29,291
then we may have found the key to
permanent human colonization.

183
00:14:29,457 --> 00:14:32,957
- We think it wise to suspend judgement
here until we take oursamples...
- Let geology and hydrology know...

184
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:35,458
- and do a thorough investigation of the area.
- we need to scramble on this, full-court press.

185
00:14:35,623 --> 00:14:37,748
So we're gonna headout there ASAP and
take a lookat this thing...

186
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:40,124
try and get an idea of its composition.

187
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:43,124
By the time you receive this, we
should just about be on site.

188
00:15:13,998 --> 00:15:16,873
Anybody else hearing that?

189
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:19,206
Yeah. What is it?

190
00:15:19,374 --> 00:15:23,499
I don't know. It sounds like, uh,
interference from the rover.

191
00:15:23,665 --> 00:15:27,874
- Can you fiix it?
- Hey, Skip, I can fiix anything.

192
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:29,541
Love that modesty.

193
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:39,791
Break out the radar. Let's see
what this thing's made of.

194
00:15:40,957 --> 00:15:43,207
Oh, yes, there's one more thing.

195
00:15:43,373 --> 00:15:47,248
Now, this is a very important, very special day
for a good friend of ours back home.

196
00:15:47,415 --> 00:15:49,332
We know he's there right now.

197
00:15:49,499 --> 00:15:53,666
Now he hates it when anybody makes any kind of a fuss
about him, so I'm not gonna mention his name.

198
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:57,874
'Cause the last thing I would want to do would be
to embarrass someone like Jim McConnell!

199
00:15:59,248 --> 00:16:02,165
Was that loud? Oh, well, it's done now.

200
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:05,499
I mean, it can't be right. It says there's
metal under there. Solid metal.

201
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:08,249
No, that doesn't make any sense. You're
reading a vein of ore, Renee.

202
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:11,374
No, it-- It says it's under the whole mountain.

203
00:16:13,747 --> 00:16:16,622
All right. Move it closer, up the power,
and we're gonna try it again.

204
00:16:16,789 --> 00:16:22,205
- Hey!
- Happy birthday to you

205
00:16:22,373 --> 00:16:25,456
Happy birthday to you

206
00:16:25,623 --> 00:16:27,206
Okay, everybody, I want you to take a look at Jim.

207
00:16:27,374 --> 00:16:29,874
- Happy birthday, dear Jim
- Now, is he all red with one of those fake...

208
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,956
"Oh, I'm-a-good-sport" grins on his face?

209
00:16:32,123 --> 00:16:34,623
- Happy birthday to you
- That's right. Now, everybody,
take-- take a lookat Ray.

210
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:38,415
Does he have one of those "This-wasn
't-in-my-mission-plan" looks on his face?
Yeah.

211
00:16:38,582 --> 00:16:41,124
Uh-huh. Thoughtso. Well, there's
nothing you can do about it, Ray.

212
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,708
We're a hundred million miles away!

213
00:16:43,873 --> 00:16:46,248
Okay, let's blow it out.

214
00:16:46,414 --> 00:16:49,081
- We're all set here, Chief.
- All right, let's crank up the juice...

215
00:16:49,247 --> 00:16:51,163
see what's in this sucker.

216
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,412
What happened?

217
00:18:30,997 --> 00:18:32,913
Oh, my God!

218
00:18:35,538 --> 00:18:39,246
- You gettin' that, Sergei?
- Uh-huh.

219
00:19:29,412 --> 00:19:31,370
Oh, my God! Renee!

220
00:19:40,664 --> 00:19:43,789
Oh! Oh, my God! Oh, Jesus! Oh, Jesus!

221
00:20:49,413 --> 00:20:55,454
Problem: hatch door malfunction, backup
power fail, manual override fail.

222
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:59,578
- Solution?
- Replace optical relay.

223
00:20:59,745 --> 00:21:02,703
Piece of cake. God, who dreams
up these nightmares?

224
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:04,912
- Don't try to change the subject.
- I'm not.

225
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:07,079
- We're talking about your
sister's wedding, right?
- No, we're talking about...

226
00:21:07,245 --> 00:21:09,453
- dancing lessons before my sister's wedding.
- This is a nightmare.

227
00:21:09,619 --> 00:21:14,744
Do you mind? I'm in the middle of a
catastrophic power failure here. Check.

228
00:21:14,911 --> 00:21:16,870
- Not effective.
- Not effective?

229
00:21:17,036 --> 00:21:19,828
- Replace optical relay.
- You're distracting me.

230
00:21:19,995 --> 00:21:23,786
Woody, we're a married couple. Would it kill you to invite
me out on the dance floor just once in a while?

231
00:21:23,954 --> 00:21:27,496
- We danced. We danced at our wedding. We danced.
- No. That's not dancing, Woody.

232
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:31,202
That's you shuffling your feet
around while you grab my butt.

233
00:21:31,369 --> 00:21:33,452
I'm talking about real dancing, you know?

234
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:37,203
Cha-cha-cha, rhumba, jitterbug.

235
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:41,328
Darling, face it. Some couples
dance. Some go to Mars.

236
00:21:41,495 --> 00:21:43,578
That's life. Test.

237
00:21:45,328 --> 00:21:47,619
Effective. Yeah. Woody, I'm serious.

238
00:21:47,786 --> 00:21:50,286
Just as soon as we get back home,
we're starting lessons.

239
00:21:50,453 --> 00:21:54,869
- Uh-huh.
- Woody, if we never dance, people are
gonna think there's something wrong.

240
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:58,038
If they see me dance, they'll know
there's something wrong.

241
00:21:58,203 --> 00:22:00,744
This is highly unprofessional.

242
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:04,368
- This is highly unprofessional, sir.
You keep forgetting that "sir."
- Sir.

243
00:22:04,536 --> 00:22:06,578
Cockpit, this is Control.

244
00:22:06,744 --> 00:22:09,786
- Cockpit, this is Control.
- Control, this is Cockpit.

245
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:13,536
Yeah, Terri, it's Phil. They want us
all to report to Micker ASAP.

246
00:22:13,702 --> 00:22:17,660
- Who says to report to Micker?
- The little men who live in my head.

247
00:22:17,828 --> 00:22:22,952
Well, that's a negative, Phil. We're in the middle
of a catastrophic power failure right now.

248
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:27,744
Yeah, Woody, it was Ray Beck. He told
me to round up the team. Now.

249
00:22:27,912 --> 00:22:30,037
The exact same moment that we
lost the data stream...

250
00:22:30,201 --> 00:22:33,785
they picked up this intense
burst of energy from Mars.

251
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:37,577
- What do you mean intense?
- Catastrophic.

252
00:22:39,911 --> 00:22:41,994
What about the crew?

253
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:47,159
The level of energy in the pulse
didn't seem survivable.

254
00:22:47,327 --> 00:22:49,244
How about the REMO?

255
00:22:49,412 --> 00:22:51,995
It went into Mars' orbit last week.
Maybe it could give us some clue.

256
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:54,495
That's just what we tried next.

257
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:57,660
All right. The, uh, resupply
module checked out fine.

258
00:22:57,828 --> 00:23:02,286
No instrument failures. Orbit holding
steady, but there was something else.

259
00:23:02,452 --> 00:23:04,410
The REMO's computer contained an uplink message--

260
00:23:04,577 --> 00:23:08,244
a very faint, highly distorted
transmission from Mars One base camp.

261
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:11,785
- Someone's alive.
- Yes, yes, yes. Put up the message.

262
00:23:11,953 --> 00:23:14,786
Still concentrating on the audio, but
we've got a long way to go.

263
00:23:14,953 --> 00:23:18,203
Show us whatever you've got. Show us.

264
00:23:23,035 --> 00:23:25,118
I have to make this-- make this fast.

265
00:23:26,786 --> 00:23:31,286
I may not get another chance to-- to
make-- another chance-- chance--

266
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:34,116
to the site-- site.

267
00:23:34,284 --> 00:23:37,201
There was a low sound that--

268
00:23:37,368 --> 00:23:40,035
a low sound-- sound-- a low sound--

269
00:23:40,202 --> 00:23:42,993
Something came out of the top of
the mountain, and it hit us.

270
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:46,077
And-- it hit us-- it hit us.

271
00:23:47,493 --> 00:23:49,493
Oh, my God!

272
00:23:50,702 --> 00:23:53,368
They're dead.

273
00:23:53,535 --> 00:23:57,118
God! Nick-- Man! They're dead.

274
00:23:57,285 --> 00:23:59,201
That's it.

275
00:24:01,912 --> 00:24:04,370
I don't know. Luke must be in pretty bad shape...

276
00:24:04,535 --> 00:24:07,701
if he hasn't just blasted out of there
in the Earth Return Vehicle.

277
00:24:07,868 --> 00:24:11,201
That thing's designed so even one crew
member can fly it back to Earth.

278
00:24:11,368 --> 00:24:13,660
Even if Luke was in great shape,
he couldn't get home.

279
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:16,744
An energy pulse of that magnitude would
have fried the ERV's computers.

280
00:24:16,911 --> 00:24:18,952
Other than the computers, how do
we think the ERV fared?

281
00:24:19,117 --> 00:24:21,825
Well, so far, our modelling says it
should be in pretty good shape.

282
00:24:21,992 --> 00:24:23,950
Which means it's gonna be up to us
to get new motherboards...

283
00:24:24,118 --> 00:24:26,534
drives and software to Mars as fast as we can.

284
00:24:26,702 --> 00:24:28,785
- Right.
- Slow it down. Slow it down. Slow it down.

285
00:24:28,951 --> 00:24:31,826
It's gonna take us weeks just
to analyse this data.

286
00:24:31,993 --> 00:24:35,659
Right, right, but in the meantime, we
gotta be workin' up a mission plan.

287
00:24:35,825 --> 00:24:39,742
- Luke needs us now.
- Luke may already be dead.

288
00:24:39,909 --> 00:24:43,534
And even if he's not, it's doubtful he is
going to be able to transmit again.

289
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:48,367
So we wouldn't know whether it's safe to land...

290
00:24:48,534 --> 00:24:51,076
until we were almost there.

291
00:25:00,784 --> 00:25:02,951
What about SIMA?

292
00:25:03,118 --> 00:25:06,868
What about SIMA? The Saturn imaging probe?

293
00:25:07,033 --> 00:25:09,241
It's gonna slingshot around Mars on its
way through the solar system.

294
00:25:09,408 --> 00:25:12,908
It could be retasked to take pictures, read
radiation levels of Mars One base camp.

295
00:25:13,075 --> 00:25:15,991
Wait, wait, wait. We are
getting ahead of ourselves.

296
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:20,242
You are forgetting the bigger
problem. The orbits are all wrong.

297
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:23,368
Our first decent launch window is
almost eight months from now.

298
00:25:23,534 --> 00:25:25,742
Yes, but we can go earlier and get there faster...

299
00:25:25,908 --> 00:25:27,824
if we reconfigure the payload for extra fuel.

300
00:25:27,992 --> 00:25:30,284
We've modelled that, Ray. I've modelled it.

301
00:25:30,452 --> 00:25:34,118
On paper, yes, but those stresses have
never been tested in space.

302
00:25:34,284 --> 00:25:38,075
- The ship can take it.
- Oh, "ship can take it."

303
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,448
I wasn't thinking of just the ship.

304
00:25:44,366 --> 00:25:48,158
Ray, I know the protocols for a Mars
recovery mission better than anybody...

305
00:25:48,325 --> 00:25:51,367
because I designed them.

306
00:25:51,534 --> 00:25:53,659
And I'm telling you, these guys can do it.

307
00:25:53,825 --> 00:25:56,909
He's right, Ray. We got a real shot here.

308
00:26:05,576 --> 00:26:09,909
Well, give me an updated mission
plan by 0800 tomorrow.

309
00:26:10,074 --> 00:26:13,157
You'll have it by 0600. Let's go to work.

310
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:20,491
- Chief, can I have a word?
- Yeah, go ahead.

311
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:26,283
- I no longer have the right crew.
- How do you mean?

312
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:28,908
Bjornstrom can be up here on the next shuttle.

313
00:26:29,074 --> 00:26:31,240
Bjornstrom is a geologist. He's
good, but not for this.

314
00:26:31,408 --> 00:26:33,325
My people just lost eight months of training.

315
00:26:33,493 --> 00:26:35,576
This is a different mission with
a different objective.

316
00:26:35,742 --> 00:26:38,326
- I haven't approved the mission yet.
- Yes, but when you do...

317
00:26:38,491 --> 00:26:41,408
it ought to be given its best chance for success.

318
00:26:43,657 --> 00:26:46,032
I want McConnell to fly right seat.

319
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,200
Oh.

320
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:53,282
Jim McConnell is no longer on mission status.

321
00:26:53,449 --> 00:26:57,115
- Yeah, because you washed him out.
- He washed himself out.

322
00:26:57,283 --> 00:27:00,575
He only had to pass a few more
psych evaluations...

323
00:27:00,741 --> 00:27:04,033
but he refused to take them.

324
00:27:04,201 --> 00:27:08,034
His wife was dead. He didn't want to lay on a
couch and share it with strangers.

325
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:11,242
Yeah, that was his call, but I
had to make one too!

326
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:13,910
It was tough as hell, but I'd do it again!

327
00:27:14,074 --> 00:27:16,616
For Christ's sake, Ray, she wasted
away in front of his eyes.

328
00:27:16,783 --> 00:27:19,824
What was he supposed to do, suck it
up? Get with the programme?

329
00:27:19,991 --> 00:27:22,283
What was his crime? That he-- That
he showed a little emotion?

330
00:27:22,449 --> 00:27:25,533
I couldn't trust him!

331
00:27:25,699 --> 00:27:28,908
When Maggie died, it knocked the hell out of him.

332
00:27:29,073 --> 00:27:31,573
It knocked the hell out of all of us.

333
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:34,031
But you know and I know he's
still the best we got.

334
00:27:34,199 --> 00:27:36,116
He and Maggie wrote the book on Mars.

335
00:27:36,284 --> 00:27:38,825
He's had more hours in the sims than
the rest of us put together.

336
00:27:38,992 --> 00:27:40,950
We can do this, Ray.

337
00:27:41,116 --> 00:27:44,199
You give me McConnell as copilot,
and we will bring Luke home.

338
00:27:44,364 --> 00:27:46,280
It's a promise.

339
00:28:38,908 --> 00:28:42,949
Hey. What's that?

340
00:28:43,116 --> 00:28:49,158
That is the exact genetic
composition of my ideal woman.

341
00:28:55,282 --> 00:28:57,490
Hey, hey, hey. Hey!

342
00:28:59,489 --> 00:29:01,614
My baby.

343
00:29:03,073 --> 00:29:06,907
- Now what is it?
- A frog?

344
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:22,405
- Hey, Skip.
- Hey. Take a look.

345
00:29:25,614 --> 00:29:27,530
Damn.

346
00:29:27,698 --> 00:29:31,698
- What do you make of that?
- Dust storm.

347
00:29:31,865 --> 00:29:34,031
Southern hemisphere, comin' from the east.

348
00:29:34,197 --> 00:29:36,113
It's a big fella too.

349
00:29:36,281 --> 00:29:39,239
-Headed straight for Mars One base camp.
-Yep.

350
00:29:39,406 --> 00:29:41,489
Could get a little hairy right about landing time.

351
00:29:41,657 --> 00:29:43,574
Yeah.

352
00:29:43,739 --> 00:29:48,031
Listen, we're gonna have to be able to move
fast, maybe even advance our ETA.

353
00:29:48,199 --> 00:29:51,824
These bad boys can cover a whole
planet and last up to a year.

354
00:29:51,988 --> 00:29:55,697
- When does SIMA do her fly-by?
- Tomorrow morning, 0600.

355
00:29:55,863 --> 00:29:59,488
That's when we find out whether we've
come all this way for nothin'.

356
00:30:01,531 --> 00:30:03,656
My money's on Luke.

357
00:30:28,613 --> 00:30:32,613

358
00:30:32,782 --> 00:30:35,907

359
00:30:36,073 --> 00:30:39,615

360
00:30:39,781 --> 00:30:44,322

361
00:30:44,489 --> 00:30:47,530

362
00:30:47,698 --> 00:30:52,031

363
00:30:52,198 --> 00:30:54,948

364
00:30:55,113 --> 00:30:58,863

365
00:30:59,029 --> 00:31:01,529

366
00:31:01,697 --> 00:31:03,614

367
00:31:05,654 --> 00:31:08,529

368
00:31:08,697 --> 00:31:11,197

369
00:31:13,323 --> 00:31:17,073

370
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:20,531

371
00:31:20,698 --> 00:31:24,614

372
00:31:24,779 --> 00:31:29,112

373
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:32,155

374
00:31:32,322 --> 00:31:36,530

375
00:31:36,697 --> 00:31:39,738

376
00:31:39,904 --> 00:31:43,154
All those interested in dance lessons,
please report to the promenade deck.

377
00:31:43,987 --> 00:31:47,904

378
00:31:50,155 --> 00:31:53,238

379
00:31:53,405 --> 00:31:56,905

380
00:31:58,737 --> 00:32:01,445

381
00:32:01,613 --> 00:32:04,863

382
00:32:23,739 --> 00:32:25,655
And what, may I ask, brought this on?

383
00:32:25,823 --> 00:32:29,698
- Zero G, my friend.
- My last chance to be graceful.

384
00:32:29,863 --> 00:32:34,946
Once we're in Mars' gravity, it's back to
shuffl in' my feet and grabbin' her butt.

385
00:32:35,113 --> 00:32:39,779

386
00:32:39,946 --> 00:32:42,613

387
00:32:42,778 --> 00:32:47,570

388
00:32:48,987 --> 00:32:52,071

389
00:32:52,237 --> 00:32:54,154
- Incoming packet.

390
00:32:54,322 --> 00:32:56,738
- Incomingpacket.

391
00:32:56,904 --> 00:33:00,112
- It's SIMA.

392
00:33:02,195 --> 00:33:03,445
Enhanced look at base camp.

393
00:33:06,361 --> 00:33:08,278
- Looks deserted.
- It's still standing, though.

394
00:33:08,445 --> 00:33:11,195
So's the ERV. And, look, there's the greenhouse.

395
00:33:11,361 --> 00:33:16,361
Well, we know Luke survived for
at least a few hours.

396
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:20,280
Now, are there any signs of recent activity?

397
00:33:20,447 --> 00:33:24,113
There. Scan northeastern quadrant of base camp.

398
00:33:26,363 --> 00:33:28,280
What the hell are those?

399
00:33:30,986 --> 00:33:34,319
- Graves.
- Wait a minute. There's only three of them.

400
00:33:34,486 --> 00:33:37,153
- That means that Luke's still gotta be
alive. It means he's still down there.
- Phil, no, no.

401
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:41,194
It just means there was no one left to bury him.

402
00:33:41,363 --> 00:33:44,196
- Check the radiation levels.
- Check rad levels.

403
00:33:45,155 --> 00:33:46,446
Normal.

404
00:33:46,611 --> 00:33:50,194
- Go to disaster site.
- Go to 41 by 9.

405
00:33:53,905 --> 00:33:55,863
- What's wrong?
- I don't know. Magnetic interference?

406
00:33:56,028 --> 00:33:58,112
- Go infrared.
- Switch to infrared.

407
00:34:00,613 --> 00:34:02,946
It's gotta be a problem with SIMA.

408
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:07,693
I don't see how an earthquake six months ago
could cause this kind of distortion.

409
00:34:07,861 --> 00:34:09,777
That was no quake.

410
00:34:33,944 --> 00:34:36,402
We are going to continue analysing this data...

411
00:34:36,569 --> 00:34:40,235
and try to determine what the
problem is with those images.

412
00:34:40,402 --> 00:34:45,152
We agree that the evidence of the graves is, uh...

413
00:34:45,321 --> 00:34:47,237
inconclusive...

414
00:34:47,404 --> 00:34:51,279
and that a ground search is advisable.

415
00:34:51,445 --> 00:34:56,069
Frankly, we are as stumped as you
guys, but we'll keep on it.

416
00:34:56,236 --> 00:34:58,653
Beware there are little sandstorms kicking up...

417
00:34:58,819 --> 00:35:02,069
- Bureau babble.
- near Mars One base.

418
00:35:02,236 --> 00:35:04,986
But the big one you spotted is turning south.

419
00:35:05,151 --> 00:35:07,067
It shouldn 't be a factor.

420
00:35:07,235 --> 00:35:10,943
We are pretty excited around here.

421
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:14,027
Well, and we are sure you must
be feeling the same.

422
00:35:14,193 --> 00:35:17,318
- Enjoy your meal and get a good night's sleep.
- Say it.

423
00:35:17,485 --> 00:35:20,068
- We anticipate...
- Say it.

424
00:35:20,236 --> 00:35:22,778
- that tomorrow morning...
- Say it.

425
00:35:22,945 --> 00:35:25,070
you will be go.

426
00:35:25,237 --> 00:35:30,028
Yes! Yes! Thank you! Thank you!

427
00:35:46,402 --> 00:35:48,736
Hooray for babyJimmy!

428
00:35:48,902 --> 00:35:52,069
Yes, Jim 's first spaceship was
seriously underpowered.

429
00:35:52,235 --> 00:35:54,234
Maggie was always a little star-struck.

430
00:35:56,568 --> 00:35:58,484
Come on. Show us those beautiful teeth.

431
00:36:00,695 --> 00:36:04,153
I am gonna get you guys for
that! l am gonna get you.

432
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,570
When they met at the Air Force Academy,
it was love at first flight.

433
00:36:06,736 --> 00:36:09,736
- Woody's line. Woody's line.
- Oh.

434
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:11,943
Later, during NASA training,
things got a little tough.

435
00:36:12,109 --> 00:36:16,359
Yes, Maggie always did keep Jim on a short leash.

436
00:36:16,527 --> 00:36:19,819
Jim was always trying to explore a heavenly body.

437
00:36:19,985 --> 00:36:21,485
- Right.
-Ah, yes.

438
00:36:21,651 --> 00:36:24,484
- Well, where are they goin '?
Where are they goin '?
- Ten-thousand-mile-high club.

439
00:36:24,652 --> 00:36:26,902
- That's right.
- Until--

440
00:36:28,153 --> 00:36:30,070
- Mission accomplished.
- Oh!

441
00:36:30,235 --> 00:36:33,985
Man, what a fun wedding. I was so whacked.

442
00:36:34,152 --> 00:36:37,902
Uh, I'm going in. T-minus three, T-minus two...

443
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:40,279
T-minus one, contact.

444
00:36:40,442 --> 00:36:43,276
Oh. Okay, we can stop it there.

445
00:36:43,442 --> 00:36:45,359
Stop there. Fast forward.

446
00:36:45,526 --> 00:36:48,026
-All right.
-And then what happened?

447
00:36:48,193 --> 00:36:50,902
I-- I know what happened.

448
00:36:51,069 --> 00:36:54,569
- What nerves.
- Okay, you guys.

449
00:36:54,736 --> 00:36:58,611
They're adding a wonderfiul chapter
to their incredible story...

450
00:36:58,775 --> 00:37:00,692
and it's a pretty historic one.

451
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:04,026
To the newly appointed co-commanders
of Mars One, Jim and Maggie!

452
00:37:04,194 --> 00:37:06,527
- Hear, hear.
- I will drink to that.

453
00:37:06,694 --> 00:37:08,277
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

454
00:37:08,443 --> 00:37:10,360
- Hold it. It's not over.
- Show 'em. Show 'em. Show 'em.

455
00:37:10,527 --> 00:37:12,069
- Yeah, we got a little-- a little addendum.
- Oh, yeah, this is good.

456
00:37:12,233 --> 00:37:14,566
- Check this out, guys.
- Here we go. It's Phil's best work.

457
00:37:14,734 --> 00:37:19,192
- Oh, yeah.
- Look! It's Mars!

458
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:22,860
You can pick up these postcards at
your local NASA souvenirshop.

459
00:37:23,026 --> 00:37:25,360
You know, when you two land up there, it
will prove once and for all...

460
00:37:25,526 --> 00:37:29,110
that there really is no intelligent life on Mars.

461
00:37:29,277 --> 00:37:30,902
-All right. Enough, enough.
- Thanks a lot. Touche.

462
00:37:31,068 --> 00:37:32,568
- You're gonna eat those words.
- Idon't thinkso.

463
00:37:32,734 --> 00:37:34,193
- Everett, give me the camera.
-All right.
- I don't think so.
- Uh-oh, here we go.

464
00:37:34,361 --> 00:37:36,402
- Let me take it away.
- What? What if l'm right?
- Here we go.

465
00:37:36,568 --> 00:37:38,484
- What if she's right?
- Why does it have to be about us?

466
00:37:38,652 --> 00:37:41,069
- You okay?
- Why can't it just be about science?
- Yes.

467
00:37:41,236 --> 00:37:44,028
- We'll do the science, and
we'll do it really well...
- Yeah.

468
00:37:44,193 --> 00:37:46,109
because that's what we've trained for.

469
00:37:46,275 --> 00:37:48,733
But what if there's more? ln all our myths...

470
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:53,275
in every human culture, Mars has
always held a special attraction.

471
00:37:55,443 --> 00:37:58,901
I mean, what if that means something?

472
00:37:59,067 --> 00:38:03,733
The universe is-- is not chaos. It's connection.

473
00:38:03,901 --> 00:38:08,359
Life reaches out for life.

474
00:38:08,526 --> 00:38:10,526
That's what we were born for, isn 't it?

475
00:38:10,692 --> 00:38:14,651
To stand on a new world and look
beyond it to the next one.

476
00:38:17,233 --> 00:38:19,191
It's who we are.

477
00:38:29,276 --> 00:38:31,192
You know, she may have been right.

478
00:38:34,235 --> 00:38:37,693
If that wasn't a quake down there,
then something else caused it...

479
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:40,735
or planned it.

480
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:43,360
You thinkin' the same thing?

481
00:38:45,983 --> 00:38:48,566
It's never been out of my mind.

482
00:38:53,567 --> 00:38:55,859
I think she knew something, Woody.

483
00:38:58,442 --> 00:39:00,567
She was the only one of us who
ever really believed...

484
00:39:00,735 --> 00:39:03,485
there might be something down there.

485
00:39:05,691 --> 00:39:09,857
Yeah, well, we're not leaving
until we find out. Deal?

486
00:39:12,276 --> 00:39:13,776
Deal.

487
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:21,356
Range: 67-83 and closing.

488
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:24,233
65 minutes until Mars orbital capture.

489
00:39:24,399 --> 00:39:27,774
Okay, people, let's look sharp now. We're
gonna run this simulation one more time.

490
00:39:27,942 --> 00:39:31,067
Remember, if we overshoot, there's no comin' back.

491
00:39:31,233 --> 00:39:34,775
Yeah, and drifting through eternity
will ruin your whole day.

492
00:39:34,943 --> 00:39:38,234
Okay, Delta-V systems initialized.

493
00:39:38,401 --> 00:39:40,818
Charge primary APU.

494
00:39:40,984 --> 00:39:43,026
Engaged and charged.

495
00:39:43,191 --> 00:39:48,233
- Select HPU fuel cells for run.
- Engaged.

496
00:39:48,399 --> 00:39:51,607
- Tie main bus to systems.
- Power ready.

497
00:39:51,774 --> 00:39:55,024
Select H2O2 HPU and fuel cells for open.

498
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:59,107
H2O2 fuel valves open.

499
00:39:59,275 --> 00:40:01,275
Charge flow.

500
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:03,608
Charged and on-line.

501
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:06,609
- Reset PW.
- Set.

502
00:40:06,775 --> 00:40:10,024
Transfer protocol data from EVA station.

503
00:40:10,191 --> 00:40:14,608
Transferred. Awaiting track confirmation.

504
00:40:15,734 --> 00:40:18,275
Jesus! Oh!

505
00:40:21,982 --> 00:40:24,148
Micrometeoroids.

506
00:40:30,732 --> 00:40:32,690
Kill those alarms!

507
00:40:41,275 --> 00:40:45,608
Critical systems alert. Critical systems alert.

508
00:40:45,774 --> 00:40:48,816
- Breach hits in the hull.
- We're outgassing, losing pressure.

509
00:40:48,983 --> 00:40:53,192
Woody, seal the breach. Looks like
it's behind Jim's helmet.

510
00:40:55,815 --> 00:40:59,106
Ninetypercent atmosphere.

511
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:17,232
Critical systems alert. Critical systems alert.

512
00:41:25,606 --> 00:41:27,939
We're losing pressure fast.
We're gonna decompress!

513
00:41:31,315 --> 00:41:33,232
Computer, how long till zero atmosphere?

514
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:37,274
Four minutes, nine seconds.

515
00:41:39,315 --> 00:41:41,232
We're still outgassing in the lower hab.

516
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:44,691
There must be another hole down
there. It's gotta be a big one.

517
00:41:44,858 --> 00:41:47,233
Everybody switch to suit oxygen.
Jim, you've got the ship.

518
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,358
- I'm going EVA.
- Copy.

519
00:41:49,523 --> 00:41:51,315
Come on, people. Let's work the problem.

520
00:41:57,522 --> 00:41:59,897
Eightypercent atmosphere.

521
00:42:00,065 --> 00:42:02,815
Jim, you got to go get your spare helmet.

522
00:42:05,608 --> 00:42:07,649
Copy that, Jim?

523
00:42:07,815 --> 00:42:12,107
There's no time. All the systems have crashed.

524
00:42:12,273 --> 00:42:14,482
I gotta shut down the hab from below.

525
00:42:14,647 --> 00:42:18,522
We're losing pressure, Jim. You could embolize.

526
00:42:34,065 --> 00:42:36,940
Seventy percent atmosphere.

527
00:42:49,982 --> 00:42:53,107
Phil, you've got to get the nav
computers back on-line.

528
00:42:53,274 --> 00:42:55,357
Uh, Jim, I've got an idea.

529
00:42:55,524 --> 00:42:57,524
if you guys can save enough atmosphere...

530
00:42:57,688 --> 00:43:00,938
I'll disconnect the power in the main
computer bay and jump-start the systems.

531
00:43:01,105 --> 00:43:04,772
- I'd basically be doing a hard boot.
- Has that been tested?

532
00:43:04,938 --> 00:43:09,980
Are you kidding? These machines
are way too expensive.

533
00:43:10,148 --> 00:43:14,731
- Do it.
- Okay. I think this will work.

534
00:43:18,897 --> 00:43:21,689
Sixty percent atmosphere.

535
00:44:01,104 --> 00:44:05,688
-Jim, how we doing on the AG?
-Just hang on one second, Woody.

536
00:44:05,855 --> 00:44:08,314
- Fifty percent atmosphere.
- Come on.

537
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,605
- Come on.
-Jim, I've got oxygen.

538
00:44:10,772 --> 00:44:14,772
- Come on.
- Voiceprint identification.

539
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:17,356
- Mc-- McCon--
- Not accepted.

540
00:44:17,521 --> 00:44:20,021
Voiceprint identification.

541
00:44:20,187 --> 00:44:22,771
- McConnell!
- Accepted.

542
00:44:22,938 --> 00:44:25,605
Shut down gravitational rotation.

543
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:28,272
Shutting down artificial gravitational rotation.

544
00:44:35,146 --> 00:44:36,729
Jim, I've got the oxygen for you.

545
00:44:40,105 --> 00:44:43,063
- Hang on!
- Fortypercent atmosphere.

546
00:44:47,313 --> 00:44:51,897
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

547
00:44:52,063 --> 00:44:56,605
- I'm topside, Jim. Do you know which sector?
- I'm working on it.

548
00:44:56,773 --> 00:45:00,356
- You better get some oxygen, Jim.
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

549
00:45:10,145 --> 00:45:11,437
Come on.

550
00:45:14,188 --> 00:45:16,480
Jesus.

551
00:45:16,646 --> 00:45:18,855
It's like lookin' for a needle in a haystack.

552
00:45:19,022 --> 00:45:21,897
Okay, come on.

553
00:45:22,063 --> 00:45:24,521
Come on. Where are you, you little bastard?

554
00:45:24,688 --> 00:45:27,146
Give me some light on the hull so I can locate it.

555
00:45:27,314 --> 00:45:29,814
I got a better idea.

556
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:37,064
Gotcha.

557
00:45:37,228 --> 00:45:40,770
Terri.

558
00:45:40,938 --> 00:45:43,271
Squeeze out the liquid.

559
00:45:44,562 --> 00:45:46,895
S-Stay there.

560
00:45:47,063 --> 00:45:49,479
- Squeeze it out.
-Jim.

561
00:45:49,646 --> 00:45:54,063
Okay. Okay. Please work.

562
00:46:00,937 --> 00:46:03,312
Thirty percent atmosphere.

563
00:46:06,936 --> 00:46:10,728
Woody, the breach is between
sectors fiive and six.

564
00:46:11,896 --> 00:46:16,479
- Five and six. Do you copy?
- Copy. I'm headin 'there now.

565
00:46:18,897 --> 00:46:22,230
Son of a bitch. You never did that in a simulator.

566
00:46:22,395 --> 00:46:28,269
- Twenty percent atmosphere.
- Jim?

567
00:46:36,437 --> 00:46:42,104
- Ten percent atmosphere.
- Jim!

568
00:46:45,061 --> 00:46:48,561
Jim, talk to me. It's Terri.

569
00:46:53,354 --> 00:46:55,812
- Jim.
- Come back.

570
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:58,021
- Breathe!
- Come back!

571
00:46:59,813 --> 00:47:01,771
Gotcha.

572
00:47:03,437 --> 00:47:06,645
Pressure stabilizing. Pressure stabilizing.

573
00:47:08,647 --> 00:47:12,189
-Jim?
- Twenty percent atmosphere.

574
00:47:14,770 --> 00:47:17,228
Hi. Welcome back.

575
00:47:17,394 --> 00:47:20,186
Thirty percent atmosphere.

576
00:47:21,396 --> 00:47:24,479
It worked! Yes! It worked!

577
00:47:24,646 --> 00:47:27,313
Way to go, everybody. All right! Yeah!

578
00:47:30,437 --> 00:47:33,145
There's a lot of scarring out here. I'm
gonna check for other punctures.

Orbital insertion proximity alert.
Orbital insertion proximity alert.

580
00:47:38,478 --> 00:47:41,270
Negative, Woody. That is a negative.
You have to get back inside.

581
00:47:41,434 --> 00:47:43,809
We have to do our checklist for orbital insertion.

582
00:47:43,977 --> 00:47:45,894
Copy. I'm on my way.

583
00:47:48,935 --> 00:47:50,935
Hello, beautiful.

- Go.
- We are go for the burn.

593
00:48:46,393 --> 00:48:48,101
I am fuelling engines.

594
00:48:48,268 --> 00:48:51,768
Flow charger on-line. Flow charger activated.

Two.

605
00:49:45,143 --> 00:49:47,727
- One.
- Let's go to Mars.

606
00:49:52,352 --> 00:49:53,768
Jesus!

607
00:49:56,435 --> 00:49:59,602
-Attitude incorrect.
- Shut down the engines.

608
00:50:03,018 --> 00:50:07,477
Engines negative. No response. I
have got no attitude control.

609
00:50:07,643 --> 00:50:10,060
- Manual separation. Blow the bolts.
- Negative. The control module...

610
00:50:10,226 --> 00:50:12,226
doesn't have enough thrust to
correct this rotation.

611
00:50:12,393 --> 00:50:15,185
We're too steep. We're falling
into the atmosphere.

612
00:50:15,352 --> 00:50:17,269
Christ, at this angle, we're gonna burn up.

613
00:50:19,642 --> 00:50:22,642
- How much time we got, Phil?
- I don't know. Three minutes? I don't know.

614
00:50:22,809 --> 00:50:25,725
- Where's the REMO?
- The resupply module? Why? There's no way
we're gonna be able to link up.

615
00:50:25,892 --> 00:50:27,934
Where is it?

616
00:50:28,101 --> 00:50:32,435
Resupply module located. Resupply module located.

617
00:50:32,601 --> 00:50:33,685
- It's close.
- How close?

618
00:50:33,852 --> 00:50:35,894
- I don't know. That's gonna take some time.
- Figure it out.

619
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:37,601
We don't have time, Phil. Figure it out now.

620
00:50:37,767 --> 00:50:40,058
Jim, we're dead stick. There's no way to
manoeuvre this ship into linkup.

621
00:50:42,852 --> 00:50:46,519
Not the ship.Just us. We go EVA.

622
00:50:46,685 --> 00:50:49,644
- You want us to transfer in suits?
-Jesus, Jim, if we don't make it--

623
00:50:49,810 --> 00:50:51,977
- If we miss the REMO--
- There's no other choice.

624
00:50:52,142 --> 00:50:55,600
- Phil, how close?
- Intersection orbit with REMO.

625
00:50:56,808 --> 00:50:59,475
Course intersection plotted.

626
00:50:59,601 --> 00:51:02,309
One kilometre. That's the best I can do.

627
00:51:03,392 --> 00:51:05,808
Prepare to abandon ship.

628
00:51:07,059 --> 00:51:08,976
Let's go!

629
00:52:19,517 --> 00:52:22,100
- What are you looking for?
- Earth.

630
00:52:24,144 --> 00:52:29,102
Hey, when we get back home, we really will
have to try this out in the sim.

631
00:52:30,350 --> 00:52:33,017
How we doing on the fuel, Woody?

632
00:52:33,142 --> 00:52:36,725
I'm at 50 percent. I don't see the REMO.

633
00:53:03,015 --> 00:53:05,724
There it is. Forty-fiive left, forty-fiive down.

634
00:53:05,890 --> 00:53:08,265
Oh,Jesus. She's not where I thought she'd be.

635
00:53:08,433 --> 00:53:10,725
- We're gonna miss her.
- What do you think?

636
00:53:11,933 --> 00:53:14,933
We can't catch it. Not like this.

637
00:53:15,101 --> 00:53:18,601
Use the tether. You'll have one, maybe two
shots before she's out of reach.

638
00:53:18,766 --> 00:53:21,224
Negative. It's too risky. If we
miss her, we got nothing.

639
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:25,391
I'll leave you the gun. Run a
line out to the REMO.

640
00:53:25,559 --> 00:53:28,267
I got enough fuel left for that.

641
00:53:28,432 --> 00:53:31,015
- You'll be going too fast.
- I'll aim to overshoot.

642
00:53:32,891 --> 00:53:36,683
Brake like hell and arc it in. Piece of cake.

643
00:53:39,142 --> 00:53:41,059
I'll see you in a flash.

644
00:53:47,598 --> 00:53:50,515
Unhook me.

645
00:53:50,682 --> 00:53:52,682
Good to go.

646
00:54:12,056 --> 00:54:16,223
Okay, I'm on a path to overshoot.
I'm gonna take the edge off.

647
00:54:23,558 --> 00:54:27,725
I'm out of fuel. Coming in hot. Still long.

648
00:54:34,181 --> 00:54:36,556
Abandoning the unit. I'll break with suitjets.

649
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:44,265
Jesus.Jesus.

650
00:54:50,181 --> 00:54:52,764
Suit jets gone. I'm gonna make contact.

651
00:54:53,890 --> 00:54:57,015
- What velocity?
- Impact's gonna be a little rough.

652
00:54:57,182 --> 00:54:58,890
- At what velocity?
- Thirty-two.

653
00:55:03,096 --> 00:55:05,055
- I'm gonna use the gun to slow you.
- No.

654
00:55:05,222 --> 00:55:07,222
- if you slow me, I'll fall short.
- It's too fast, Woody.

655
00:55:07,390 --> 00:55:10,598
No choice. I'll be okay. Here we go!

656
00:55:12,472 --> 00:55:14,056
Gotcha.

657
00:55:14,223 --> 00:55:15,890
Woody!

658
00:55:18,057 --> 00:55:19,848
Woody!

659
00:55:22,098 --> 00:55:24,265
Woody! Woody!

660
00:55:24,431 --> 00:55:26,640
Woody. Woody.

661
00:55:26,808 --> 00:55:29,849
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- Woody. Woody.

662
00:55:34,930 --> 00:55:36,597
- Terri.
- Woody.

663
00:55:36,765 --> 00:55:39,473
Take the gun. Take it.

664
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:43,930
Phil, hang on. Go.

665
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:53,640
Woody, what's your status?

666
00:55:53,805 --> 00:55:59,138
Well, uh, my suit jets are gone, and I'm
still carrying a good deal of velocity.

667
00:55:59,306 --> 00:56:01,639
Soon as we get hooked up, I'll come get you.

668
00:56:01,807 --> 00:56:04,724
- I'd have to say negative on that, Jim.
- Negative on the transmission?

669
00:56:04,890 --> 00:56:08,265
No, I heard you. Negative on the
manoeuvre. I am not retrievable.

670
00:56:08,430 --> 00:56:11,763
- Woody, you're not going that fast.
- Well, it all comes down to the
amount of fuel, honey.

671
00:56:11,930 --> 00:56:14,763
Suit jets are designed for
attitude control, not travel.

672
00:56:14,930 --> 00:56:17,597
- Retrieval just won't work.
- Well, it's gotta work.

673
00:56:17,723 --> 00:56:20,639
Hey, listen. I don't like it any more than you do.

674
00:56:20,806 --> 00:56:23,098
- Woody.
- Run the numbers, Jim.

675
00:56:23,265 --> 00:56:25,182
I am.

676
00:56:29,974 --> 00:56:31,682
You hang tight, Woody.

677
00:56:31,847 --> 00:56:34,139
We'll get in the REMO, drop her
down and come scoop you up.

678
00:56:34,307 --> 00:56:38,265
- Sounds good, Jim.
- It's gonna take us half an hour
to get the REMO reoriented.

679
00:56:38,430 --> 00:56:40,346
Woody will be in the atmosphere by then.

680
00:56:40,513 --> 00:56:43,680
- Then we'll just have to get her moving faster.
- We don't have time.

681
00:56:43,846 --> 00:56:45,888
Listen to Jim, honey. It's a good plan.

682
00:56:46,056 --> 00:56:49,639
No. We're gonna come get you.

683
00:56:52,557 --> 00:56:54,557
- Okay. Get ready for brakes.
- Come on, now.

684
00:56:54,722 --> 00:56:56,139
- On my mark. Three...
- You can do it.

685
00:56:56,304 --> 00:56:57,638
- two...
- You can do it!
- one.

686
00:56:57,806 --> 00:56:59,847
- Come on!
- Mark!
- Come on!

687
00:57:01,515 --> 00:57:02,723
Yeah!

688
00:57:02,889 --> 00:57:04,847
Yeah!

689
00:57:06,430 --> 00:57:08,555
- Everybody good?
- We're on, Jim.

690
00:57:10,429 --> 00:57:11,721
Way to go. Way to go.

691
00:57:13,764 --> 00:57:15,680
Good job.

692
00:57:15,846 --> 00:57:18,304
All right. There won't be
enough room for us inside.

693
00:57:20,055 --> 00:57:22,347
Soon as I get the hatch open, let's
start dumping the cargo.

694
00:57:22,513 --> 00:57:24,304
- Copy that.
- Hang on, Woody.

695
00:57:24,472 --> 00:57:26,389
Will do, Jim.

696
00:57:33,888 --> 00:57:35,430
Hello, beautiful.

697
00:57:39,390 --> 00:57:41,390
Come on.

698
00:57:41,555 --> 00:57:43,555
All right. It's open.

699
00:57:47,804 --> 00:57:50,554
- Terri, no!
- Terri! Come back!

700
00:57:52,264 --> 00:57:53,764
You'll never make it!

701
00:57:53,930 --> 00:57:57,555
- Terri, what are you doing?
- I'll tell you what I'm not doing, Woody.

702
00:57:57,722 --> 00:58:00,680
- I'm not gonna watch you die.
- Terri.

703
00:58:00,847 --> 00:58:02,638
You'd do the same for me.

704
00:58:02,805 --> 00:58:06,055
Phil, get inside, dump the cargo
and start the systems. Now!

705
00:58:06,221 --> 00:58:09,013
- No, I wouldn't. Not if it was impossible.
- I can do it!

706
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:12,471
No, you can't. You don't have enough fuel
to come get me and get us back.

707
00:58:14,762 --> 00:58:17,720
Listen to me, goddamn it. You have to
stop, and you have to stop now.

708
00:58:17,887 --> 00:58:21,095
He's right, Terri. It's no use.

709
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:38,179
Okay, honey.

710
00:58:41,431 --> 00:58:43,515
You gotta go back now.

711
00:58:45,513 --> 00:58:47,638
The hell I do.

712
00:59:27,553 --> 00:59:30,303
What are you doing?

713
00:59:30,471 --> 00:59:33,304
I'm gonna jet in a little closer and try again.

714
00:59:33,471 --> 00:59:36,554
Terri, you spend any fuel getting
closer, you won't get back.

715
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:38,970
And if anyone tries to get you, they'll die too.

716
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:44,179
Honey, please. Please go back.

717
00:59:46,386 --> 00:59:48,386
Go back and help the others to the surface.

718
00:59:50,219 --> 00:59:51,844
I am not losing you!

719
00:59:53,303 --> 00:59:55,386
I can't let you do it.

720
00:59:55,554 --> 00:59:59,137
- I can't let you die. I'm sorry.
- Woody.

721
00:59:59,304 --> 01:00:01,304
What are you doing?

722
01:00:01,471 --> 01:00:03,221
- Love you, honey.
- Woody--

723
01:00:03,387 --> 01:00:06,304
No. No!

724
01:00:06,469 --> 01:00:09,761
- God, how I love you.
- Woody! Don't!

725
01:00:11,013 --> 01:00:14,304
Woody! Woody!

726
01:00:14,470 --> 01:00:18,928
Woody! Don't! No!

727
01:00:21,594 --> 01:00:25,386
No! Please, God, no!

728
01:00:30,261 --> 01:00:32,677
Woody.

729
01:00:35,888 --> 01:00:37,179
Woody.

730
01:00:43,011 --> 01:00:44,636
Come back, Terri.

731
01:00:46,221 --> 01:00:49,096
- He's gone.
- No.

732
01:00:51,053 --> 01:00:53,136
No.

733
01:00:53,302 --> 01:00:55,302
- Terri.
- No.

734
01:00:57,011 --> 01:00:59,303
We need you.

735
01:00:59,470 --> 01:01:01,261
Woody.

736
01:01:03,011 --> 01:01:04,928
No.

737
01:01:08,593 --> 01:01:11,260
No. No.

738
01:01:12,469 --> 01:01:14,469
No.

739
01:01:15,803 --> 01:01:17,719
No.

740
01:01:20,717 --> 01:01:22,634
Please, Terri.

741
01:01:23,885 --> 01:01:25,802
Come back.

742
01:02:00,261 --> 01:02:03,552
Ray. We've got some new data just coming in.

743
01:02:04,927 --> 01:02:07,427
We just-- It doesn't make any sense.

744
01:02:07,595 --> 01:02:09,678
We're not sure how to read this.

745
01:02:09,844 --> 01:02:12,177
- Data?
- Yes.

746
01:02:12,343 --> 01:02:16,384
Telemetry reports the REMO left its orbit
and reached the Martian surface.

747
01:02:16,553 --> 01:02:21,303
- Crashed?
- No, sir. Under power.

748
01:02:21,469 --> 01:02:24,469
- What?
- Sixty-three minutes after Mars
Recovery went off-line.

749
01:02:24,633 --> 01:02:26,758
Sir, the graph shows a controlled descent...

750
01:02:26,926 --> 01:02:29,051
but that doesn't make any sense.

751
01:02:33,010 --> 01:02:35,260
They used the REMO as a lander.

752
01:02:35,427 --> 01:02:38,177
- It's-- It's Jim McConnell.
- It's got to be.

753
01:02:38,344 --> 01:02:41,052
- Nobody else could have pulled this off.
- Nobody else.

754
01:02:43,885 --> 01:02:45,093
Son of a bitch.

755
01:04:27,717 --> 01:04:32,009
I've got access to the ERV. I'm gonna go inside.

756
01:04:41,967 --> 01:04:44,217
Terri, is the oxygen generator okay?

757
01:04:45,426 --> 01:04:49,217
Yeah. It's gonna take a while to get back
to 100 percent capacity, though.

758
01:04:51,510 --> 01:04:53,510
Okay, I'm entering the hab.

759
01:05:15,259 --> 01:05:17,759
There's still oxygen in here.

760
01:05:17,924 --> 01:05:19,966
This is a little spooky.

761
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:24,508
I don't like the dark at all.

762
01:05:25,885 --> 01:05:28,176
- Need some lights.
- Need some lights.

763
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:32,633
Okay. Where are we?

764
01:05:34,215 --> 01:05:36,215
Here we go.

765
01:05:38,217 --> 01:05:40,758
ERV appears to be structurally intact.

766
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:50,383
Yeah, but just as we thought,
the computers are fried.

767
01:05:50,551 --> 01:05:52,551
Copy that.

768
01:05:52,717 --> 01:05:56,550
- I got busted filters here.
- Clogged intakes.

769
01:05:56,718 --> 01:06:00,217
Hell of a cleanup job, but so far no major damage.

770
01:07:00,175 --> 01:07:02,175
I'm in the greenhouse.

771
01:07:05,383 --> 01:07:08,883
- You gotta see this.
- What is it, Jim?

772
01:07:11,298 --> 01:07:13,298
It's working.

773
01:07:28,507 --> 01:07:30,965
I'll be damned.

774
01:08:26,008 --> 01:08:28,383
- Luke.
- No!

775
01:08:37,799 --> 01:08:40,674
- You're not here!
- You are not here!

776
01:08:44,714 --> 01:08:47,214
Your wife is Debra. Your son is Bobby.

777
01:08:47,381 --> 01:08:49,715
- No!
- You're reading Treasure lsland with him.

778
01:08:52,547 --> 01:08:54,214
Luke--

779
01:08:55,422 --> 01:08:57,589
It's all right. It's me.

780
01:08:59,006 --> 01:09:01,090
-Jim?
- Yeah.

781
01:09:02,799 --> 01:09:05,007
No, wait! No! No, no! Wait, wait!

782
01:09:05,173 --> 01:09:07,173
He's all right. He's all right.

783
01:09:10,174 --> 01:09:12,215
Phil? Phil.

784
01:09:17,588 --> 01:09:19,630
Terri.

785
01:09:24,465 --> 01:09:26,632
- Jim--Jim, what are you-- what are you--

786
01:09:26,798 --> 01:09:29,006
- What are you doing here?
- You're not supposed to be--

787
01:09:29,172 --> 01:09:31,171
- You're not supposed to be here.
- How are you here?

788
01:09:31,339 --> 01:09:33,589
- How are you here?
- This is a rescue mission.

789
01:09:36,089 --> 01:09:38,089
Woody wanted me right seat.

790
01:09:43,465 --> 01:09:45,048
I can't--

791
01:09:46,337 --> 01:09:48,254
I can't believe--

792
01:09:58,630 --> 01:10:00,796
- Well, where is he?
- Where's Woody?

793
01:10:12,798 --> 01:10:14,715
He didn't make it.

794
01:10:29,547 --> 01:10:30,922
God.

795
01:10:32,131 --> 01:10:34,798
Oh. Oh.

796
01:10:34,964 --> 01:10:36,964
Oh, no, no.

797
01:10:37,130 --> 01:10:40,005
Oh, God. Oh, no.

798
01:10:51,046 --> 01:10:53,712
Well, it works, you know? I give them...

799
01:10:53,838 --> 01:10:55,922
CO2 and light, and...

800
01:10:56,088 --> 01:10:58,005
they give me oxygen and food.

801
01:10:58,171 --> 01:11:00,546
It's-- It's actually not a bad
arrangement, you know?

802
01:11:00,712 --> 01:11:02,837
It's kind of like a marriage, really...

803
01:11:03,005 --> 01:11:05,838
except not as many-- not as many fights.

804
01:11:06,006 --> 01:11:09,089
- I mean, some fights.
- Luke. Tell us what happened here.

805
01:11:13,255 --> 01:11:15,171
I--

806
01:11:17,381 --> 01:11:19,297
We fired the radar...

807
01:11:20,337 --> 01:11:24,170
and it-- it came, and they all died.

808
01:11:24,338 --> 01:11:27,005
They all-- They all died.

809
01:11:27,170 --> 01:11:29,254
- Wh-What do you mean?
- What-- What came?

810
01:11:29,421 --> 01:11:32,421
The force came out of the top of
the mountain and-and-and...

811
01:11:32,588 --> 01:11:35,880
everybody died, but I was spared.

812
01:11:37,713 --> 01:11:40,380
Why? Why?

813
01:11:41,421 --> 01:11:43,338
Had to be for a reason.

814
01:11:45,754 --> 01:11:48,838
And then all of a sudden, I knew the reason why.

815
01:11:50,672 --> 01:11:53,089
It's so someone would be left to
figure out the secret.

816
01:11:55,337 --> 01:11:57,253
You know? It's--

817
01:11:59,921 --> 01:12:04,296
J-J-J ust come.Just come, come,
come, come, come, come.

818
01:12:06,838 --> 01:12:10,754
Is it just me, or is he a few meal
packs short of a picnic?

819
01:12:10,921 --> 01:12:13,962
Long-term exposure to low gravity can have
an adverse impact on the brain.

820
01:12:15,172 --> 01:12:17,963
Or then, he could be suffering
from some form of asphyxia.

821
01:12:20,213 --> 01:12:23,755
Or maybe his whole crew died, and he's been
marooned alone on Mars for a year.

822
01:12:27,128 --> 01:12:29,128
It's a miracle he's survived this long.

823
01:12:34,588 --> 01:12:36,588
I'd better bring him up to speed.

824
01:12:46,172 --> 01:12:48,505
Great, great. Great, great, great, great.

825
01:12:52,129 --> 01:12:54,129
So let me be sure I understand this.

826
01:12:55,335 --> 01:12:58,043
Your ship blew up with all its supplies.

827
01:12:58,211 --> 01:13:01,128
Then you-- Then you emptied all the
cargo out of the REMO...

828
01:13:01,294 --> 01:13:03,669
and it was totalled on landing.

829
01:13:03,836 --> 01:13:07,919
You got no food, no water, no, no spare oxygen.

830
01:13:09,837 --> 01:13:12,004
Nothing other than what I'm looking at right here.

831
01:13:16,712 --> 01:13:19,378
What kind-- What kind of rescue
mission is this, Jim?

832
01:13:24,297 --> 01:13:26,130
That kind.

833
01:13:26,294 --> 01:13:29,211
Check it out. New nav boards for the ERV.

834
01:13:29,377 --> 01:13:31,877
I got four round-trip tickets,
baby, right in here.

835
01:13:35,628 --> 01:13:39,087
Thank you, God! Oh, thank God.

836
01:13:45,127 --> 01:13:48,460
When I came to and dug myselfout of the
sand, my faceplate was cracked.

837
01:13:48,628 --> 01:13:52,378
It was leaking. Leaking badly.

838
01:13:52,546 --> 01:13:54,546
I barely made it back to base.

839
01:13:55,796 --> 01:13:59,129
It was weeks before I could work up the nerve
to go back out there and look for--

840
01:14:03,211 --> 01:14:05,211
and look for their bodies.

841
01:14:08,211 --> 01:14:13,003
Renee was the only one I could find, but it just
didn't seem right somehow to just dig one grave.

842
01:14:14,295 --> 01:14:16,295
Oh, God.

843
01:14:36,836 --> 01:14:39,086
Has it been blowing like this for a while?

844
01:14:39,253 --> 01:14:40,586
Yeah.

845
01:14:41,878 --> 01:14:47,211
We saw a big storm on our screens, but
Micker said it was turning south.

846
01:14:47,378 --> 01:14:49,294
If it holds course.

847
01:14:52,879 --> 01:14:56,253
Luke, this-- this whatever it was.

848
01:14:56,420 --> 01:14:59,170
This-- This force.

849
01:15:01,084 --> 01:15:04,125
You said it came directly out of
the top of the mountain?

850
01:15:05,961 --> 01:15:07,961
Don't you believe me?

851
01:15:10,876 --> 01:15:13,376
That's okay, Jim. You don't believe me,
that's okay, but I'm not crazy.

852
01:15:13,543 --> 01:15:16,710
- I know that much. I'm not crazy.
- What'd you mean by its "secret"?

853
01:15:18,837 --> 01:15:20,003
What secret?

854
01:15:20,211 --> 01:15:22,627
Listen, hundred of millions of
years have gone by, okay?

855
01:15:22,794 --> 01:15:26,502
You got erosion, lava flow,
sandstorms, meteor impacts.

856
01:15:26,669 --> 01:15:28,794
Hell, in that much time, the whole surface
of the planet would have changed.

857
01:15:28,961 --> 01:15:30,878
So it's no wonder we never saw it before.

858
01:15:31,046 --> 01:15:33,171
I mean, we saw it, but not like they meant us to.

859
01:15:33,335 --> 01:15:36,419
- There was too much dirt on it.
- Saw what, Luke?

860
01:15:38,501 --> 01:15:40,334
Saw this.

861
01:15:51,417 --> 01:15:52,626
Jesus.

862
01:15:54,377 --> 01:15:57,127
Oh, my God. Luke, what are you trying to tell us?

863
01:15:57,293 --> 01:16:00,002
- You're trying to tell us that that's a face?
- That's the face.

864
01:16:02,086 --> 01:16:04,128
It's the face. It's real.

865
01:16:04,291 --> 01:16:06,291
Somebody put that thing there, and it's not us.

866
01:16:07,501 --> 01:16:09,001
Jim--

867
01:16:12,252 --> 01:16:14,252
It's not possible.

868
01:16:16,876 --> 01:16:19,292
Jesus.

869
01:16:21,044 --> 01:16:23,044
Look at that. My God.

870
01:16:25,793 --> 01:16:27,293
I know.

871
01:16:30,169 --> 01:16:32,919
Luke, uh, what--

872
01:16:33,086 --> 01:16:35,002
what about that sound you heard
before the explosion?

873
01:16:35,167 --> 01:16:37,625
Oh, yeah. Good, Jim. Th-Th-That's
the key. That's the key.

874
01:16:48,251 --> 01:16:51,543
- You hear that?
- Yeah.

875
01:16:59,169 --> 01:17:01,252
- It's pauses. Do you hear the pauses?
- Yeah.

876
01:17:05,835 --> 01:17:07,835
See, that's what made me realize it's a pattern.

877
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:11,375
It's a repeating pattern.

878
01:17:13,542 --> 01:17:16,375
- Mathematical?
- Mm-hmm. That occurred to me too.

879
01:17:25,459 --> 01:17:27,418
There are distinct blocks within each pattern...

880
01:17:27,585 --> 01:17:30,252
and within each block, the tones
come in groups of three.

881
01:17:30,419 --> 01:17:34,252
- It's three, three, three, three, three,
three. It's always three, three, three.
- It's always the same.

882
01:17:34,418 --> 01:17:36,335
And, see, for months I struggled
to analyse it, you know...

883
01:17:36,503 --> 01:17:38,711
trying different constructs, and then
I thought about dimensions.

884
01:17:38,875 --> 01:17:42,083
- X-Y-Z coordinates.
- Exactly. Three groups equals three dimensions.

885
01:17:42,250 --> 01:17:47,166
So l-l assigned different graphic values
to each block group and tone...

886
01:17:47,334 --> 01:17:50,001
and I came up with this.

887
01:17:58,834 --> 01:18:00,959
- Hello.
- Oh, my God.

888
01:18:02,085 --> 01:18:05,501
- Is that what I think it is?
- DNA?

889
01:18:05,668 --> 01:18:07,668
- You see it?
- Yeah.

890
01:18:09,832 --> 01:18:13,748
- It's a model of DNA.
- So-- So somebody left that thing here.

891
01:18:13,916 --> 01:18:15,958
Okay. Somebody other than human.

892
01:18:18,708 --> 01:18:21,999
But, uh, what is it?

893
01:18:22,166 --> 01:18:24,083
It's a signature.

894
01:18:26,459 --> 01:18:29,167
It's a self-portrait of whatever
species created the face.

895
01:18:31,667 --> 01:18:36,042
Yeah, but, uh, that DNA looks human.

896
01:18:36,209 --> 01:18:39,251
- No.
- No, it's not. It's missing the
last pair of chromosomes. See?

897
01:18:39,419 --> 01:18:43,127
- This is close. It's damn close.
- "Close"?

898
01:18:43,292 --> 01:18:46,375
The difference between man and ape is less
than three percent genetic material.

899
01:18:47,582 --> 01:18:52,832
But that three percent gives you Einstein, Mozart.

900
01:18:53,001 --> 01:18:54,376
Jack the Ripper.

901
01:18:55,709 --> 01:18:58,084
Yeah, he's right.

902
01:19:16,707 --> 01:19:19,832
Four pallets, oral, topical medications...

903
01:19:19,999 --> 01:19:23,040
splints, bandages, one complete med pack.

904
01:19:23,207 --> 01:19:25,874
With eight tubes of antifungal cream.

905
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:28,040
Well, at least we won't rash to death.

906
01:19:31,750 --> 01:19:34,624
Luke. How do you feel?

907
01:19:36,084 --> 01:19:39,000
Lighter. A lot lighter.

908
01:19:39,167 --> 01:19:41,167
- Welcome back.
- Thanks, man.

909
01:19:43,376 --> 01:19:46,918
The backup generator is salvageable. So
are two of the solar panels.

910
01:19:47,082 --> 01:19:49,290
I'm pretty sure I can get the oxygen
still back into production.

911
01:19:49,458 --> 01:19:53,916
So we're not in such bad shape, considering.

912
01:19:54,083 --> 01:19:55,999
That's good, Terri.

913
01:19:58,209 --> 01:19:59,625
Good work.

914
01:20:01,123 --> 01:20:02,623
Jesus.

915
01:20:05,582 --> 01:20:09,874
Look at this. Phil's idea of absolute essentials.

916
01:20:10,041 --> 01:20:11,666
Of course.

917
01:20:30,249 --> 01:20:32,291
Hey, hey, hey. Hey!

918
01:20:34,208 --> 01:20:35,167
My baby.

919
01:20:36,833 --> 01:20:39,833
- It's not a signature.
- What?

920
01:20:41,457 --> 01:20:43,624
The noise from the face. It's not a signature.

921
01:20:45,792 --> 01:20:47,334
It's a test.

922
01:20:47,498 --> 01:20:50,248
It's asking us for the right answer.

923
01:20:50,414 --> 01:20:53,914
It wants us to put in the
missing pair of chromosomes.

924
01:20:54,081 --> 01:20:55,998
Why?

925
01:20:56,165 --> 01:20:58,165
To prove that we're human.

926
01:21:00,915 --> 01:21:04,124
We fired radar into that thing,
concentrated radio waves, and you're
saying--

927
01:21:04,290 --> 01:21:06,415
Which it interpreted as the wrong answer.

928
01:21:06,581 --> 01:21:08,497
It's-- It could be like a security alarm.

929
01:21:08,665 --> 01:21:12,790
When it gets an incorrect
response, it defends itself.

930
01:21:12,957 --> 01:21:15,332
So what happens when it gets the right answer?

931
01:21:17,083 --> 01:21:20,499
Well, I don't know that, Phil.

932
01:21:23,332 --> 01:21:25,332
But we gotta find out.

933
01:21:39,416 --> 01:21:42,541
Luke, what if we work this the other way?

934
01:21:42,708 --> 01:21:46,249
We figure out which tones would be
equivalent to the missing chromosomes...

935
01:21:46,416 --> 01:21:49,166
and then dub them into

936
01:21:49,333 --> 01:21:52,292
- Is that possible?
- Yeah.

937
01:21:55,415 --> 01:21:57,998
- Yeah, I think so.
- Good, good, good.

938
01:21:58,165 --> 01:22:03,915
What about the radar gun? Will it accept the input so we
can transmit a completed signal back to the face?

939
01:22:04,082 --> 01:22:07,999
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold
on, Jim. What if you're wrong?

940
01:22:09,788 --> 01:22:11,788
Whoever goes out there--

941
01:22:13,039 --> 01:22:15,956
I mean, what if you're wrong? Three people
have already died over that thing.

942
01:22:16,123 --> 01:22:17,623
Four.

943
01:22:21,207 --> 01:22:22,707
Terri.

944
01:22:25,372 --> 01:22:29,955
If we leave here without getting some
answers, they all died in vain.

945
01:22:31,830 --> 01:22:33,330
We don't--

946
01:22:34,663 --> 01:22:36,747
We don't have to go out there.

947
01:22:54,914 --> 01:22:58,372
Got a lot of static here. Something's interfering.

948
01:22:58,539 --> 01:23:01,789
Yeah. The antenna got knocked around
pretty badly in the blast.

949
01:23:01,956 --> 01:23:04,706
This is the best resolution I think
we're gonna be able to get.

950
01:23:04,873 --> 01:23:08,623
All right, guys. I got the nav
boards. I'm sealing the airlock.

951
01:23:13,204 --> 01:23:17,204
- Check the video feed.
- Video feed looks good.

952
01:23:20,665 --> 01:23:23,456
- How close do we have to get?
- I'm not sure.

953
01:23:24,662 --> 01:23:26,662
Maybe I'll stop it right over there by that rock.

954
01:23:30,122 --> 01:23:31,705
Do it. Good.

955
01:24:05,955 --> 01:24:09,080
Okay. Here we go.

956
01:24:55,080 --> 01:24:56,289
Look at that, Jim.

957
01:24:57,540 --> 01:25:01,123
It worked. Oh, God, it worked.

958
01:25:01,288 --> 01:25:05,288
Guys, I don't know what the hell we just did...

959
01:25:05,453 --> 01:25:08,828
but does that look to you like a hostile gesture?

960
01:25:08,996 --> 01:25:13,163
No. More like an invitation.

961
01:25:14,580 --> 01:25:16,330
Or another test.

962
01:25:18,620 --> 01:25:20,661
- Check for radiation.
- Normal.

963
01:25:21,871 --> 01:25:24,954
Seismic: Normal. Anemometer: Steady.

964
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:28,455
Luke...

965
01:25:30,577 --> 01:25:32,494
does the rover still work?

966
01:25:43,703 --> 01:25:45,703
Phil, do you read?

967
01:25:45,871 --> 01:25:49,746
Uh, yeah, Jim, your signal's breaking up a
little in the storm, but I read you.

968
01:25:49,912 --> 01:25:51,912
We're at the face.

969
01:25:53,162 --> 01:25:55,537
- We're gonna need a few minutes here.
- Same deadline.

970
01:25:57,996 --> 01:26:00,788
Launch at 1950 with or without us. Copy?

971
01:26:02,994 --> 01:26:04,661
Copy that.

972
01:26:05,703 --> 01:26:09,411
Jim. You sure you wanna do this?

973
01:26:10,704 --> 01:26:12,620
I'm not sure about anything any more.

974
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:19,287
But I didn't come 100 million miles just
to turn back in the last ten feet.

975
01:26:27,121 --> 01:26:28,496
Yeah.

976
01:26:40,452 --> 01:26:41,702
Please work.

977
01:26:43,286 --> 01:26:44,786
It's gonna work.

978
01:26:49,162 --> 01:26:52,245
Yes. Yes. Computers are on-line.

979
01:26:53,537 --> 01:26:57,245
I am gonna start loading software.

980
01:27:08,245 --> 01:27:10,328
The surface...

981
01:27:10,495 --> 01:27:12,411
seems firm and level.

982
01:27:13,620 --> 01:27:15,536
Roger that.

983
01:27:15,703 --> 01:27:17,620
The texture's smooth.

984
01:27:18,828 --> 01:27:21,536
I've got good footing. No obstructions.

985
01:27:22,870 --> 01:27:24,953
- Let's check our PSl.
- Okay.

986
01:27:26,828 --> 01:27:29,244
Guys, I gotta tell you...

987
01:27:29,412 --> 01:27:32,370
we're losing visibility here really fast. Over.

988
01:27:32,537 --> 01:27:34,870
It's solid. We're trapped.

989
01:27:36,079 --> 01:27:39,745
Don't move. Just keep this orientation.

990
01:27:42,993 --> 01:27:44,493
Guys?

991
01:27:46,910 --> 01:27:48,827
Luke? Terri? Jim?

992
01:27:50,035 --> 01:27:52,035
Phil, can you still hear me?

993
01:27:52,994 --> 01:27:56,078
Is anyone there? Over.

994
01:28:04,578 --> 01:28:06,495
God. That's it.

995
01:28:07,871 --> 01:28:10,538
There's no handles. We're not getting out
of here unless they let us out.

996
01:28:41,618 --> 01:28:43,784
-Jim. Jim, what are you doing?
-Jim, what are you doing?

997
01:28:43,951 --> 01:28:45,243
-Jim.Jim, your suit!
- Stop. Stop it! Jim, you're depressurizing.

998
01:28:45,410 --> 01:28:47,327
- Seal your suit.
- Come on!
- Seal your suit now!

999
01:28:55,869 --> 01:28:57,785
There's pressure in here.

1000
01:28:57,953 --> 01:29:02,286
Above Mars atmospheric? It's impossible.

1001
01:29:04,870 --> 01:29:07,828
We're millions of miles from Earth
inside a giant white face.

1002
01:29:07,994 --> 01:29:09,911
What's impossible?

1003
01:29:11,534 --> 01:29:13,076
There's 12 PSI in here.

1004
01:29:14,576 --> 01:29:17,409
Nitrogen and oxygen.

1005
01:29:17,576 --> 01:29:19,492
Otherwise known as air.

1006
01:29:32,785 --> 01:29:35,743
Hey, wait, Jim. I haven't checked for
lethal trace gases, and I haven't--

1007
01:29:39,868 --> 01:29:41,201
What the hell.

1008
01:31:29,826 --> 01:31:31,160
Look.

1009
01:31:39,575 --> 01:31:43,200
- That what I think it is?
- Yeah. It's Mars.

1010
01:33:18,532 --> 01:33:20,449
That's where they went.

1011
01:33:25,199 --> 01:33:28,741
Look. One stayed behind.

1012
01:33:53,366 --> 01:33:55,908
Earth, before the continents separated.

1013
01:34:07,864 --> 01:34:10,614
My God. That's it.

1014
01:34:10,782 --> 01:34:12,699
Hundreds of millions of years ago...

1015
01:34:12,866 --> 01:34:15,616
there was a sudden explosion of life on Earth.

1016
01:34:17,032 --> 01:34:20,990
The first multi-celled plants
and animals appeared.

1017
01:34:21,157 --> 01:34:24,115
No one has ever understood why or how it happened.

1018
01:35:30,155 --> 01:35:32,072
They seeded Earth.

1019
01:35:38,073 --> 01:35:39,989
They're us.

1020
01:35:42,156 --> 01:35:43,239
We're them.

1021
01:36:10,613 --> 01:36:13,071
Luke? Terri?Jim? Anyone?

1022
01:36:13,239 --> 01:36:15,239
ERV to rover. Rover, this is ERV.

1023
01:36:15,406 --> 01:36:17,906
Does anyone copy? Does anyone copy?

1024
01:36:27,614 --> 01:36:31,030
ERV to rover. Rover, this is ERV. do you copy?

1025
01:36:31,199 --> 01:36:33,241
- Phil?
- Oh, thank God, l got you.

1026
01:36:33,404 --> 01:36:36,613
- Phil, we read you.
- Listen, the storm is getting bad, really bad.

1027
01:36:36,779 --> 01:36:39,696
It's gonna totally sock us in in a few
minutes. You've got to get back to theship.

1028
01:36:39,863 --> 01:36:42,363
- Phil?
- I repeat, you've got to get back to the ship.

1029
01:36:42,530 --> 01:36:43,905
Phil?

1030
01:36:45,780 --> 01:36:47,364
We're in a ship.

1031
01:36:50,489 --> 01:36:53,447
This is a ship.

1032
01:36:54,697 --> 01:36:58,280
And the countdown's already started.

1033
01:36:59,781 --> 01:37:01,989
- He's right.
- Yeah.

1034
01:37:02,155 --> 01:37:04,197
Yeah, let's-- Iet's get the hell out of here.

1035
01:37:07,529 --> 01:37:09,196
Jim?

1036
01:37:10,529 --> 01:37:11,487
Jim.

1037
01:37:14,612 --> 01:37:17,529
Come on. We gotta go.

1038
01:37:17,696 --> 01:37:20,862
- I'm not coming with you.
- What?

1039
01:37:22,947 --> 01:37:24,863
What are you talking about?

1040
01:37:26,530 --> 01:37:27,696
We've gotta get home.

1041
01:37:29,363 --> 01:37:31,280
That's where I'm going.

1042
01:37:33,531 --> 01:37:35,114
Don't you see?

1043
01:37:36,820 --> 01:37:39,820
That's-- That's what all this is for.

1044
01:37:42,529 --> 01:37:46,279
Terri, you were right. This is an invitation.

1045
01:37:47,697 --> 01:37:50,156
This is an invitation for us to follow them home.

1046
01:37:53,071 --> 01:37:54,488
I'm going.

1047
01:37:58,321 --> 01:38:00,321
It's what I was born for.

1048
01:38:02,947 --> 01:38:04,864
Like Maggie said:

1049
01:38:06,364 --> 01:38:10,030
"To stand on a new world and--
and look beyond it...

1050
01:38:11,487 --> 01:38:12,653
to the next one."

1051
01:38:16,903 --> 01:38:18,820
I know this is right.

1052
01:38:21,321 --> 01:38:22,404
For me.

1053
01:38:24,697 --> 01:38:28,364
And you're running out of time. You gotta get back to
the ERV and you gotta get off this planet.

1054
01:38:39,736 --> 01:38:41,736
for saving my life, buddy.

1055
01:38:43,195 --> 01:38:44,778
It was a privilege.

1056
01:39:03,697 --> 01:39:05,780
I wish Woody were here to see you.

1057
01:39:08,905 --> 01:39:10,821
He is here, Terri.

1058
01:39:12,069 --> 01:39:14,111
We wouldn't have made it without him.

1059
01:39:29,112 --> 01:39:31,112
He would have wanted you to have this.

1060
01:40:16,027 --> 01:40:19,402
ERV to rover. Rover, this is ERV. Do you copy?

1061
01:40:26,819 --> 01:40:30,069
ERV to rover. Rover, this is ERV. Do you read me?

1062
01:40:35,194 --> 01:40:37,778
Phil, this is Luke. Do you copy?

1063
01:40:46,403 --> 01:40:49,486
- He's not reading me.
- I can barely read you.

1064
01:40:49,653 --> 01:40:52,403
- Let's get the hell out of here.
- Yeah.

1065
01:41:48,443 --> 01:41:52,443
I've lost the base camp beacon.
We're driving blind.

1066
01:41:52,610 --> 01:41:55,819
I'm just gonna keep going on a straight
line, okay? That's our only chance.

1067
01:42:07,984 --> 01:42:11,651
- 1 949. Terri, we're not gonna make it.
- No.

1068
01:42:11,820 --> 01:42:16,361
I've worked with Phil for four years, and I know Jim gave him
a direct order, but he is not gonna leave without us.

1069
01:42:17,193 --> 01:42:19,860
Please. Luke?

1070
01:42:20,025 --> 01:42:22,108
Terri?Jim?

1071
01:42:23,776 --> 01:42:24,901
ERV to rover.

1072
01:42:26,276 --> 01:42:28,484
Rover, this is ERV. Do you read me?

1073
01:42:28,651 --> 01:42:32,776
Phil, do you read? This is Luke.
We're coming in. Phil.

1074
01:42:35,152 --> 01:42:37,985
- Phil!
- Phil isn't here right now.
