1
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,782
Mutiny's a big word, Hodges,
but panic I understand.

2
00:00:09,923 --> 00:00:11,857
But mutiny?

3
00:00:11,992 --> 00:00:14,358
What gave Colonel Burgess
life-and-death autonomy

4
00:00:14,494 --> 00:00:16,689
over these people?

5
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:05,674
It's my brother Courtney, Mr. Paladin.

6
00:01:05,812 --> 00:01:08,872
He's vanished.
I want you to find him.

7
00:01:09,015 --> 00:01:11,506
I don't care what it costs. Find him.

8
00:01:11,651 --> 00:01:14,142
- Drink?
- No, thank you.

9
00:01:14,287 --> 00:01:15,914
Thank you, no, Hey Boy.

10
00:01:16,056 --> 00:01:18,115
You suspect violence?

11
00:01:18,258 --> 00:01:22,251
Hmm. With brother Courtney the victim?
It's hardly likely.

12
00:01:22,396 --> 00:01:23,829
How can you say that?

13
00:01:23,964 --> 00:01:25,795
Because I've encountered
hundreds like him.

14
00:01:25,932 --> 00:01:27,661
This nation has produced
a bumper crop.

15
00:01:27,801 --> 00:01:30,998
The bad check fraternity,
brotherhood of the I.O.U.

16
00:01:31,138 --> 00:01:33,003
- That's not being fair!
- I'm being honest!

17
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:36,701
That's what Mr. Paladin needs,
honesty at this end...

18
00:01:36,843 --> 00:01:38,140
if not at the other.

19
00:01:38,278 --> 00:01:40,542
The quick smile, the empty promise,
the moist handshake,

20
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,409
that's what you look for.

21
00:01:42,549 --> 00:01:45,677
And when you feel the sudden
thrust of a knife between your shoulders,

22
00:01:45,819 --> 00:01:48,413
that's when you know you've
found Courtney Burgess.

23
00:01:48,555 --> 00:01:51,649
My husband's merchant mind fails
to acknowledge

24
00:01:51,792 --> 00:01:55,228
that some men are born special,

25
00:01:55,362 --> 00:01:59,093
destined for more than keeping ledgers.

26
00:01:59,232 --> 00:02:02,099
It's what she wants, Mr. Paladin.

27
00:02:02,235 --> 00:02:06,194
Give her what she wants.

28
00:02:06,273 --> 00:02:08,400
Courtney wrote last from Sacramento

29
00:02:08,542 --> 00:02:11,443
to tell me he was heading north
in search of the future.

30
00:02:11,578 --> 00:02:14,206
This time he said he was determined
to make good for himself.

31
00:02:14,347 --> 00:02:16,838
Well, I don't see that you
really need me at all,

32
00:02:16,983 --> 00:02:18,917
surely the Sacramento police.

33
00:02:19,052 --> 00:02:21,714
I don't think you understand, Mr. Paladin.

34
00:02:21,855 --> 00:02:25,450
Courtney disappeared seven years ago.

35
00:03:05,398 --> 00:03:07,730
Hot enough for you?

36
00:03:07,868 --> 00:03:11,736
lt'll do.

37
00:03:13,206 --> 00:03:16,004
Emmett Wilhoit, Grand Rapids.

38
00:03:17,077 --> 00:03:19,011
Paladin, San Francisco.

39
00:03:19,145 --> 00:03:21,170
Who shot you?

40
00:03:21,314 --> 00:03:23,578
Indians, up trail.

41
00:03:23,717 --> 00:03:26,982
In case your going what way.

42
00:03:28,855 --> 00:03:31,881
It'll be all right.
A little rest is all I need.

43
00:03:32,025 --> 00:03:36,826
- Sure.
- You best turn on back.

44
00:03:36,963 --> 00:03:42,333
They even burned old Burgess' fort up ahead,
so they say.

45
00:03:42,469 --> 00:03:46,405
- Burgess?
- Know him?

46
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,974
I've been looking for him for two months.

47
00:03:49,109 --> 00:03:52,203
Well, he ain't hiding,
not Colonel Burgess.

48
00:03:52,345 --> 00:03:56,577
Colonel? Burgess never spent a day
in the army in his life.

49
00:03:56,716 --> 00:03:59,844
No, not our army, his own army.

50
00:03:59,986 --> 00:04:01,476
His own fort.

51
00:04:01,621 --> 00:04:04,215
This country's his...

52
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:10,457
unless the Indians take it back all from
Colonel Burgess.

53
00:04:10,597 --> 00:04:13,065
They shoot good, too.

54
00:04:15,502 --> 00:04:17,129
You look out now.

55
00:04:24,277 --> 00:04:27,144
Yeah.

56
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,805
I'll look out now.

57
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:08,047
Anybody here?

58
00:06:08,181 --> 00:06:10,115
Hello?

59
00:09:22,742 --> 00:09:25,506
Uhh!

60
00:09:29,015 --> 00:09:30,949
You must be fond of that gun.

61
00:09:31,084 --> 00:09:32,813
I've grown attached to it.

62
00:09:32,952 --> 00:09:36,479
- Are you going to kill me?
- Should I?

63
00:09:36,623 --> 00:09:39,717
If you're taking a ballot, I vote no.

64
00:09:39,859 --> 00:09:42,327
It's the Colonel you've come for,
I suppose?

65
00:09:42,462 --> 00:09:44,089
Now how would you know that?

66
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:46,698
Well, mister, everybody comes looking
for the Colonel.

67
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:49,597
It's a regional sport, like lacrosse.

68
00:09:49,736 --> 00:09:53,672
He'd tell you so himself,
if he weren't presently indisposed.

69
00:09:58,711 --> 00:10:00,736
That's Courtney Burgess?

70
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,814
What's left of him.

71
00:10:02,949 --> 00:10:06,942
Me, I'm the ever-faithful Sam Hodges,
the Colonel's dog-robber.

72
00:10:07,086 --> 00:10:08,781
Can I get up now?

73
00:10:22,502 --> 00:10:25,528
This man isn't drunk, he's ill.

74
00:10:25,672 --> 00:10:29,164
- Typhoid.
- Typhoid?

75
00:10:29,309 --> 00:10:31,174
That would account for
the empty water barrels.

76
00:10:31,311 --> 00:10:33,245
But what about those three
in the orderly room?

77
00:10:33,379 --> 00:10:35,506
Now typhoid didn't take them out.

78
00:10:35,648 --> 00:10:37,582
Would you believe it?

79
00:10:37,717 --> 00:10:41,244
Out of a company of 12, all but those three
defected.

80
00:10:41,387 --> 00:10:43,252
You know, once nature turns on man,

81
00:10:43,389 --> 00:10:46,051
it' ain't but a hop, skip, and a jump until
man turns on himself.

82
00:10:46,192 --> 00:10:48,319
Why were they shot,
and where are the others?

83
00:10:48,461 --> 00:10:51,555
Well, it's a long story.
Have you got a minute?

84
00:10:57,303 --> 00:11:00,238
Well, I do, but I'm not so sure
about your Colonel.

85
00:11:00,373 --> 00:11:02,603
He's not going anyplace.

86
00:11:02,675 --> 00:11:05,803
Chief Tamasun and his war party
arrived ten days ago.

87
00:11:05,945 --> 00:11:08,106
They didn't even bother to attack.
They knew they didn't have to.

88
00:11:08,247 --> 00:11:10,408
Thirst was on their side, thirst and fever.

89
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:12,074
What stirred them up?

90
00:11:12,218 --> 00:11:15,881
Well, a slight misunderstanding between
Tamasun and the Colonel.

91
00:11:16,022 --> 00:11:17,580
You know, when it comes to progress,

92
00:11:17,724 --> 00:11:23,128
you can depend on the Chief to be on
the conservative side every time.

93
00:11:23,262 --> 00:11:26,288
Well, the Colonel had only
12 men to keep order.

94
00:11:26,432 --> 00:11:29,868
There was near to 80 settles. They were
rubbing each other raw.

95
00:11:30,003 --> 00:11:34,201
Food was running low,
then the water turned.

96
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,740
Six cases of typhoid in one day.

97
00:11:36,876 --> 00:11:39,674
Four of them buried out behind
the stables.

98
00:11:51,858 --> 00:11:55,487
Yes, sir. That's what started the mutiny.

99
00:11:55,628 --> 00:12:01,464
You know, it was just as if a mad dog
had been set loose in the fort.

100
00:12:01,601 --> 00:12:05,537
The Colonel tried to reason with them.
They wouldn't listen.

101
00:12:05,605 --> 00:12:09,166
They were going. There wasn't nobody going to
stop them.

102
00:12:09,308 --> 00:12:12,402
They'd rather take their chances
with the Nez Perce Indians

103
00:12:12,545 --> 00:12:15,537
than stick and risk the fever.

104
00:12:15,681 --> 00:12:19,447
Mutiny, Hodges?
Mutiny's a pretty strong word.

105
00:12:19,585 --> 00:12:22,213
Panic I can understand.
But mutiny?

106
00:12:22,355 --> 00:12:24,755
Against what?

107
00:12:24,891 --> 00:12:27,985
What gave the Colonel
and his private militia

108
00:12:28,127 --> 00:12:30,857
life-or-death autonomy
over those settlers?

109
00:12:30,997 --> 00:12:35,525
When Moses led his people out of Egypt, did
anybody challenge his qualifications?

110
00:12:35,668 --> 00:12:39,297
Well, that's a pretty ambitious analogy.

111
00:12:39,439 --> 00:12:43,239
Mister, when the Colonel came here,
this was wilderness.

112
00:12:43,376 --> 00:12:45,503
Everything you see here
he made happen.

113
00:12:45,645 --> 00:12:47,738
Because of a dream.

114
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:51,043
When a man sets up housekeeping in another
man's dream,

115
00:12:51,184 --> 00:12:56,053
the Colonel figured the landlord had
the right to set up a few rules.

116
00:12:56,189 --> 00:12:58,123
That's fair enough, but what rules?

117
00:12:58,257 --> 00:13:01,090
Colonel Burgess put a roof
over their head,

118
00:13:01,227 --> 00:13:04,458
clothes on their back,
vittles in their belly.

119
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:08,660
And if he taxed them,
if he demanded strict obedience

120
00:13:08,801 --> 00:13:10,598
and a share of their crops,

121
00:13:10,736 --> 00:13:13,227
it was his rightful due.

122
00:13:13,372 --> 00:13:17,433
And you stuck with him. Why?
Typhoid doesn't worry you?

123
00:13:17,577 --> 00:13:21,104
Of course it worries me.

124
00:13:21,247 --> 00:13:25,650
But abandoning the Colonel to die alone, that
worries me more.

125
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,354
You couldn't take him with you?

126
00:13:29,489 --> 00:13:32,117
Oh, the Indians.
They let the others through.

127
00:13:32,258 --> 00:13:33,452
All they want is the Colonel.

128
00:13:39,999 --> 00:13:42,263
Well, this man's sick.

129
00:13:42,401 --> 00:13:44,699
He needs a doctor.
He needs medicine.

130
00:13:44,837 --> 00:13:47,397
And folks in hell are needing ice water.

131
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:50,805
Maybe there's something in the stores,
I don't know. We can see.

132
00:13:50,943 --> 00:13:54,037
Don't let them kill me!

133
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:58,617
Now, nobody's going to kill you,
I promise.

134
00:13:58,751 --> 00:14:01,515
Please, I don't want to stay.

135
00:14:01,654 --> 00:14:04,418
Ask him to take me with him.

136
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:07,152
When you're better.

137
00:14:21,507 --> 00:14:23,702
You never did say who it was
who sent you.

138
00:14:23,843 --> 00:14:25,811
Was it Floyd Miniver,
Denver Mine and Ore?

139
00:14:25,945 --> 00:14:27,469
Nope.

140
00:14:27,613 --> 00:14:30,946
- Hope you brought a horse.
- Only as far as the woods.

141
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:33,108
I don't hear anybody laying railroad track.

142
00:14:33,252 --> 00:14:35,015
How are you planning
to bust out of here?

143
00:14:35,154 --> 00:14:37,213
That's a good question.
How are you?

144
00:14:37,356 --> 00:14:40,257
As long as Tamasun doesn't attack,
there's hope.

145
00:14:40,393 --> 00:14:42,327
I'm still alive.

146
00:14:42,461 --> 00:14:45,021
Well, he knows this fort is unprotected.
What's holding him back?

147
00:14:45,164 --> 00:14:47,894
A healthy fear of typhoid.

148
00:14:48,034 --> 00:14:51,470
That's my little ace.
I ain't played the big ace yet.

149
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:56,365
No horses, no water,

150
00:14:56,509 --> 00:15:00,673
200 miles from nowhere, besieged by hostile
Indians and fever.

151
00:15:00,813 --> 00:15:02,576
What are you saving it for?

152
00:15:02,648 --> 00:15:06,106
You play your hand, I'll play mine.

153
00:15:15,061 --> 00:15:17,621
Was it the Merchant Trust in Abilene?

154
00:15:17,763 --> 00:15:20,061
Nope.

155
00:15:21,067 --> 00:15:24,525
- Luke Frost sent you.
- Nope.

156
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:27,400
Then it was the Colbert brothers.

157
00:15:28,674 --> 00:15:31,234
The way you keep rattling off names,

158
00:15:31,377 --> 00:15:35,746
one might get the impression that your
Colonel had left a fairly spotty back trail.

159
00:15:35,881 --> 00:15:39,009
A man in a hurry's bound to pick up
a few enemies.

160
00:15:39,151 --> 00:15:42,086
You know, you don't just plant a seed
and up pops a fort.

161
00:15:42,221 --> 00:15:44,519
It takes planning, sweat.

162
00:15:44,657 --> 00:15:46,818
Indian sweat?

163
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:51,555
Like the Colonel always says, it wasn't
kindness that built the pyramids.

164
00:15:51,697 --> 00:15:54,689
So a few savages die.
What of it?

165
00:15:54,834 --> 00:15:57,064
The end result, that's what counts.

166
00:15:57,203 --> 00:16:02,698
Apparently, Chief Tamasun
doesn't share your Colonel's opinion.

167
00:16:02,775 --> 00:16:06,768
Here's some choral hydrate.
That ought to ease his pain a little bit.

168
00:16:06,912 --> 00:16:08,846
What did they tell you about him?

169
00:16:08,981 --> 00:16:12,974
- They?
- Whoever sent you.

170
00:16:13,119 --> 00:16:17,852
They told me never
to turn my back on him.

171
00:16:19,692 --> 00:16:23,150
On anyone, friend.

172
00:16:23,296 --> 00:16:25,628
Now what is this going to buy you?

173
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,834
One less complication.

174
00:16:29,969 --> 00:16:32,733
Oh, no, you're gonna need me
before long, friend.

175
00:16:32,872 --> 00:16:36,205
Against a hundred Nez Perce?
Uh-uh.

176
00:16:36,342 --> 00:16:39,869
All I need is the Colonel.
He's my property.

177
00:16:48,154 --> 00:16:52,056
Oh, no! If he's killed, we're finished!

178
00:17:17,149 --> 00:17:21,142
I knew it. Here he comes,
Tamasun.

179
00:17:24,857 --> 00:17:28,293
Stay away! This is my ace,
and here's where I play it!

180
00:17:35,368 --> 00:17:37,632
Palau!

181
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:39,431
Tamasun will talk.

182
00:17:39,572 --> 00:17:42,097
It took you long enough!
All right, I'm listening!

183
00:17:42,241 --> 00:17:44,436
But talk fast! It's hot out here!

184
00:17:44,577 --> 00:17:48,035
Speak true, Ametsun.
Plenty hot here.

185
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,148
Tamasun make trade.

186
00:17:50,282 --> 00:17:53,979
Give us Oak Leaf chief, we go.
No more blood.

187
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,588
That's no bargain.

188
00:17:56,722 --> 00:17:59,816
Like maybe Tamasun burn fort, huh?

189
00:17:59,959 --> 00:18:01,893
You won't do that.

190
00:18:02,027 --> 00:18:04,222
You want the Oak Leaf chief alive.

191
00:18:04,296 --> 00:18:06,662
The dirty heathens,
they want to torture him!

192
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,926
Maybe Tamasun come get him.

193
00:18:09,068 --> 00:18:13,596
Into the camp of the big fever?
Not likely.

194
00:18:13,739 --> 00:18:16,503
Face it, Chief, your braves are bored
and restless.

195
00:18:16,642 --> 00:18:19,338
For ten days they've been cooking
in this hot sun.

196
00:18:19,478 --> 00:18:21,241
They want to get back to their squaws.

197
00:18:23,315 --> 00:18:28,912
Two ponies, a fresh supply of water,
guaranteed safe passage,

198
00:18:29,054 --> 00:18:31,955
those are my terms.

199
00:18:32,091 --> 00:18:33,149
For Oak Leaf chief?

200
00:18:33,292 --> 00:18:37,592
Signed, sealed and delivered.

201
00:18:42,802 --> 00:18:45,362
You wait.

202
00:18:45,504 --> 00:18:47,563
I'm not going anywhere.

203
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:05,015
I told you I had the big ace!

204
00:19:06,392 --> 00:19:10,829
You can't turn this man over to them to be
tortured, no matter what he's done.

205
00:19:10,963 --> 00:19:13,397
Look at him. There's not much
left of him.

206
00:19:13,532 --> 00:19:17,263
A few minutes off his life,
that's all I want to borrow.

207
00:19:17,403 --> 00:19:19,394
The Colonel's jacket's
hanging in his office.

208
00:19:19,538 --> 00:19:21,665
Get it.

209
00:19:21,807 --> 00:19:25,675
Why stand on ceremony?
Just throw him out like he is.

210
00:19:25,811 --> 00:19:30,214
There's a lot you don't understand
about Nez Perce logic.

211
00:19:30,349 --> 00:19:32,943
To them, the uniform is the authority.

212
00:19:33,085 --> 00:19:35,144
The same as a tribal chief's known by his
bonnet.

213
00:19:35,287 --> 00:19:37,414
It's the uniform they want to punish.

214
00:19:37,556 --> 00:19:42,050
If I hung those oak leaves on your shoulder,
you'd be the Colonel to them.

215
00:19:42,194 --> 00:19:48,360
Now, you get that jacket before I take it
into my head to do just that.

216
00:19:57,776 --> 00:20:00,244
You ain't going nowhere.

217
00:20:22,902 --> 00:20:24,802
Over here.

218
00:20:24,937 --> 00:20:27,929
All right, fun's over!
Give me the jacket!

219
00:20:28,073 --> 00:20:30,064
No sale.

220
00:20:33,078 --> 00:20:34,705
Over your dead body then.

221
00:20:54,266 --> 00:20:57,326
Awful place to shoot a man.

222
00:21:01,407 --> 00:21:05,605
I've been hoping all day you wouldn't force
me do that, Mr. Burgess.

223
00:21:05,678 --> 00:21:09,512
You knew.

224
00:21:09,648 --> 00:21:13,584
Was it Sy Ingersoll?
Did he send you?

225
00:21:15,321 --> 00:21:18,518
You can't let a fellow check out with
a puzzlement on his mind.

226
00:21:18,657 --> 00:21:21,353
It was your sister.

227
00:21:23,762 --> 00:21:25,593
You're supposed to bring me back.

228
00:21:25,731 --> 00:21:30,293
No, she just wondered what was happening.
She was concerned.

229
00:21:30,436 --> 00:21:33,997
I bet I know who it was who told you never to
turn your back on me.

230
00:21:34,139 --> 00:21:36,437
That stiff-necked brother-in-law of mine.

231
00:21:38,877 --> 00:21:42,643
He always said I'd come to a bad end.

232
00:21:42,781 --> 00:21:47,275
This fort, this business, it wasn't so bad.

233
00:21:47,419 --> 00:21:51,583
Mr. Burgess, you and I are both
near dead.

234
00:21:55,961 --> 00:21:58,361
I got use for you yet.

235
00:21:58,497 --> 00:22:00,465
Give me the jacket.

236
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:03,295
I got no time to argue!

237
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:11,104
Put it on. Put it on.

238
00:22:16,849 --> 00:22:21,548
When you get back, and you better get back,
mister,

239
00:22:21,687 --> 00:22:24,713
this is the part I want you to tell them.

240
00:22:32,731 --> 00:22:35,859
Tell my brother-in-law the kind of end
I came to.

241
00:22:36,001 --> 00:22:38,834
Do you understand?

242
00:22:38,971 --> 00:22:40,962
I understand.

243
00:23:38,797 --> 00:23:40,731
He's dead!

244
00:24:42,895 --> 00:24:44,829
<i>"Have Gun Will Travel"</i>

245
00:24:44,963 --> 00:24:49,696
<i>Reads the card of a man</i>

246
00:24:49,835 --> 00:24:56,365
<i>A knight without armor
in a savage land</i>

247
00:24:56,508 --> 00:24:58,499
His fast gun for hire

248
00:24:58,644 --> 00:25:02,842
<i>Heeds the calling wind</i>

249
00:25:02,915 --> 00:25:05,406
<i>A soldier of fortune</i>

250
00:25:05,551 --> 00:25:13,424
<i>Is the man called Paladin</i>

251
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:19,862
<i>Paladin, Paladin, where do you roam?</i>

252
00:25:19,998 --> 00:25:28,133
<i>Paladin, Paladin, far, far from home</i>
