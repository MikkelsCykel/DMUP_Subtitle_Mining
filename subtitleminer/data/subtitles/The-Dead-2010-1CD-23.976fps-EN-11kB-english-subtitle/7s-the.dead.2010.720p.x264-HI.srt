(flies buzzing)

4
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:27,045
- (woman sobbing)
- Keep the pressure on.

00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:30,177
(grunting)

6
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:33,555
James, just stay with us.
James.

7
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:36,974
(baby crying)

8
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,846
James, don't.
Don't, James, please.

9
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:43,390
James.
Stay with me, James.

10
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:45,230
Stay with me.
I need you, James.

11
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:46,894
James, look at me.

12
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,357
(crying)

13
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:50,651
I've lost power.

14
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:52,566
Just stay with us, James.

15
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,451
(people screaming)

16
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:55,701
What's happening?

17
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:58,159
Fuel starvation in both engines.

18
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,574
- The plane's going down.
- (woman screaming)

19
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:02,994
I told you it wasn't ready.

20
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,460
If we'd stayed on the ground,
we'd all be dead.

21
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:09,249
We're all dead anyway.

22
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:12,590
There's a...
there's a landing strip

23
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:17,099
30 miles inside Sierra Leone.

24
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,134
Forget it.

25
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:21,099
We're going down now.

26
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:25,940
Woman: James.

27
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,818
James, look at me.

28
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:31,355
(sobbing)

29
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:32,943
No. No.

30
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,318
Oh God.

31
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:42,040
James, James,
please don't leave me.

32
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,451
Get out of the way.

33
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,460
No. No.

34
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,292
Man: You stupid...

35
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:50,253

(engine roaring)

40

(woman gasping)

50
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,249
Help.

51
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:59,414
Swim over here.

52
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,548
Reach for my hand.

53
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,394
Grab my hand.

54
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:51,378
Wait! Shit.

55
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:38,467
No! No! No!

56
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:40,260

66

Malana.

(speaking native language)

68
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:14,904

(rustling)

71
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,148
(engine grinding)

72
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,359
Okay.

73
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,747
(exclaims)

74
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,453
(engine grinding)

(engine revving)

80
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,578
Come on.

81
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:33,386
(gun clicking)

82
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:42,850

83

(speaking French)

84
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,072
I don't understand.

85
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:57,612
You're American?

86
00:28:57,778 --> 00:28:59,075
I'm American, yeah.

87
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:01,366
- Are you bitten?
- No, I'm okay.

88
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:05,126
Up.

89
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:07,208
What?

90
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:08,668
Up.

91
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:28,772
Get in.

92
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:49,379
You drive. I push.

93
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:01,679
(engine starts)

94
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:23,807
Do you know
if there's a better road?

95
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:27,219
At this rate
we're gonna break an axle.

96
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:29,639
There are roadblocks
along all the main roads.

97
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:32,274
They are scared.

98
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:34,309
They have killed many.

99
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:37,400
My orders are to be with them,
but I must find my son.

100
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,912
Look,

101
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:53,249
thanks for your help
back there.

102
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:56,006
For a moment I thought
you were gonna kill me.

103
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:59,043
And I thought you would leave
like the rest of your people.

104
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:00,927
They have all left...

105
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:04,807
doctors, aid workers,
missionaries.

106
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:06,842
I don't understand the white man.

107
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:08,885
Your soldiers come
with guns to fight us

108
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:11,396
and your doctors come
with medicine to save us.

109
00:32:16,977 --> 00:32:19,651
Look,

110
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:22,532
I'm an engineer,
a mechanic.

111
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:25,114
I fix things... machines,

112
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:28,451
whatever needs fixing.
That's it.

113
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,661
An American mercenary.

114
00:32:30,824 --> 00:32:33,794
I'm just trying to survive.

115
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:44,012
You know if there's an airport
around here somewhere

116
00:32:44,171 --> 00:32:46,469
where you can fly out from?

117
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,850
There's no airport here,

118
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:51,353
not since your bombs
destroyed it.

119
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:55,478
Just a small airbase.

120
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:59,235
But I think all the planes are gone.

121
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:02,489
You're not the only person
who wants to leave, my friend.

122
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,649
How far away is it?

123
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,944
Because if there's something there,

124
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:09,329
maybe I can fix it

125
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:11,832
and we can...
we can fly out of here.

126
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:21,842
I will take you there on the condition
you give me this car.

127
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,345
It's not possible to survive on foot.

128
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,848
The dead are everywhere.

129
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:31,681
You take me there...

130
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:34,221
you get this car.

131
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:42,567
This way.

132
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:56,872
Why are you still here?

133
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,788
I thought all your people had left
when it started.

134
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:03,125
I was on the last plane out,

135
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,840
but we came under attack.

136
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:08,676
Couldn't hold them off any longer.

137
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:11,261
Couldn't get the plane ready in time.

138
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:14,519
They just took off.

139
00:34:14,678 --> 00:34:16,476
The fuel lines were still attached.

140
00:34:16,638 --> 00:34:19,733
I barely managed
to get on board myself.

141
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:22,690
People were running alongside
the plane, begging to get on.

142
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:25,230
We just left them there to die.

143
00:34:27,357 --> 00:34:29,701
It was all for nothing.

144
00:34:31,361 --> 00:34:34,740
The plane crashed off the coast.

145
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,954
And...

146
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:41,917
I'm the only one left.

147
00:34:46,293 --> 00:34:48,512
What about you?

148
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,889
What are you doing here?

149
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:55,386
Our orders are
to be at the roadblocks,

150
00:34:55,552 --> 00:34:58,055
to stop the spread
by shooting the infected.

151
00:34:58,221 --> 00:35:00,690
But I left to find my son.

152
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:02,726
He's all I have now.

153
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:05,236
And if they find me,
they'll kill me.

154
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:11,109
Where‘s your son?

155
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:13,119
My village was attacked.

156
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:15,656
He was among the survivors.

157
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:19,247
I think they've been taken
to the military base in the north.

158
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:21,457
I'll find him there.

159
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:24,089
(gunfire)

160
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:37,139
(shouting)

161
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:39,350
Hey! Hey!

162
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:43,358
Hey hey!

163
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:45,518
Hey!

164
00:35:51,775 --> 00:35:54,324
(speaks native language)

165
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:07,666
(distant gunfire)

166
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,558
(flies buzzing)

167
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:13,017
(sighs)

168
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:35,252
(flies buzzing)

169
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:51,602
(chicken clucks)

170
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:52,890
(bones crack)

171
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:55,059
(engine starts)

172
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:25,719
(flies buzzing)

173
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:46,869
(engine rattling)

174
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:56,041
(engine stops)

175
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:13,313
How far is it?

176
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,473
Can we make it on foot?

177
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,018
With God's blessing,

178
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:21,028
I think it's possible.

179
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:21,039
(sniffs)

180
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:16,037
(gasps)

181
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,162
(flies buzzing)

182
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:35,006
(gasps)

183
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:39,594
(snarling)

184
00:44:57,028 --> 00:44:59,201
(panting)

185
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:01,866
(metallic bang)

186
00:45:59,215 --> 00:46:01,593
(clicks switch)

187
00:46:11,811 --> 00:46:13,859
(radio waves hissing)

188
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:19,493
Hello.

189
00:46:19,652 --> 00:46:21,996
Is anyone receiving? Over.

190
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:24,202
(radio waves squealing)

191
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:27,618
This is flight engineer

192
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:29,879
Lieutenant Brian Murphy,

193
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:33,462
sole survivor
of military evacuation flight

194
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:36,002
Lima November 2-6-0.

195
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:38,216
Does anyone read me? Over.

196
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,974
I'm stranded in hostile territory,

197
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:47,013
under constant attack,

198
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:49,056
without any food or water.

199
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:52,147
I need help.

200
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:54,608
Can anyone hear me? Over.

201
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:03,116
If anyone can hear this,

202
00:47:03,279 --> 00:47:05,577
my coordinates are

203
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:09,711
20° west...

204
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:16,129
Never mind.

205
00:47:18,711 --> 00:47:21,055
I have to keep moving.

206
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:25,097
Over.

207
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:28,012
(radio waves hissing)

208
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:36,813
It's useless.
There's nothing here we can use.

209
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:38,981
I found fuel.

210
00:47:41,025 --> 00:47:43,949
The place I go...
it's a military base.

211
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:48,540
It might have an airplane.

212
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:52,078
It's a long journey for me alone.

213
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:54,622
Maybe it's not possible.

214
00:47:56,665 --> 00:48:00,260
But with some help... maybe.

215
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:08,393
Okay.

216
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:32,622
(insects chirping)

217
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:07,445
- (branch snaps)
- (rustling)

218
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:58,643
(gas pouring)

219
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:38,975
(machete slicing)

220
00:51:57,948 --> 00:52:00,121
Jesus Christ.

221
00:52:00,284 --> 00:52:02,207
Please

222
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:04,667
let us not blaspheme.

223
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:34,155
We need to find
some food and water.

224
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:36,195
We're not gonna make it.

225
00:52:36,362 --> 00:52:38,660
We'll find something.

226
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:41,166
I'm low on ammo.

227
00:52:41,325 --> 00:52:43,794
Me too.

228
00:53:05,224 --> 00:53:08,023
(sighs)

229
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:48,396
You must rest.
Maybe I should drive.

230
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:50,982
No no, I'm all right.

231
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:07,832
(engine idling)

232
00:54:09,288 --> 00:54:11,757
(sighs) Okay.

233
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:51,121
(birds twittering)

234
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:28,159
(man shouts
in native language)

235
00:55:52,683 --> 00:55:55,653
Who are you
and why are you with this soldier?

236
00:55:55,811 --> 00:55:58,030
I'm Daniel Dembele
of the Senufo tribe.

237
00:55:58,188 --> 00:56:00,862
I'm traveling north
to find my son.

238
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:03,197
He's an American...

239
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,704
a military engineer.

240
00:56:05,863 --> 00:56:10,289
It‘s okay.
We're helping each other.

241
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:18,375
We would be very grateful

242
00:56:18,542 --> 00:56:20,419
if you had some food
and water for us.

243
00:56:20,586 --> 00:56:23,339
As you can see,
my friend has a fever.

244
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:32,981
(guns click)

245
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:43,241
- (people chattering)
- (woman wailing)

246
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:03,503
Why is the military
protecting this place?

247
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:06,844
These men
are no longer soldiers.

248
00:57:07,007 --> 00:57:09,180
They have returned home
as brothers,

249
00:57:09,343 --> 00:57:11,437
fathers and sons
to protect their families.

250
00:57:11,595 --> 00:57:13,597
The war between us is no more.

251
00:57:13,764 --> 00:57:15,266
There's a new war.

252
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:17,309
We have to fight it together.

253
00:57:21,939 --> 00:57:25,534
Ah, that's a witch doctor.

254
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:27,945
Some believe he can protect us.

255
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:53,933
(insects chirping)

256
00:57:55,347 --> 00:57:57,645
Where are you heading?

257
00:57:57,808 --> 00:58:01,813
There's a military base
at the edge of the desert,

258
00:58:01,979 --> 00:58:05,358
about 200 miles north of here.

259
00:58:05,524 --> 00:58:07,652
I hope to find my son there.

260
00:58:07,818 --> 00:58:10,446
I know of this place.

261
00:58:10,612 --> 00:58:13,365
I've heard you can find
safety there.

262
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:18,788
Why don't you take
your people there?

263
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:22,049
Are they not
vulnerable here?

264
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:24,676
This is our home.
We will never leave.

265
00:58:30,382 --> 00:58:33,101
Do you have family?

266
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:45,355
My son

267
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:47,945
is a bright boy.

268
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:51,870
He was doing well at school.

269
00:58:52,029 --> 00:58:54,031
When he grows up,

270
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:56,541
he wants to become a doctor.

271
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:09,675
(men chattering)

272
00:59:17,721 --> 00:59:20,144
What happened here?

273
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:25,562
It was about a week ago.

274
00:59:25,729 --> 00:59:28,903
A woman from this village

275
00:59:29,066 --> 00:59:32,616
saw her father walking
in the forest at night.

276
00:59:32,778 --> 00:59:35,122
He'd been killed the day before,

277
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:39,626
attacked by what we all thought
was a wild animal.

278
00:59:39,785 --> 00:59:44,586
But that was just the beginning.

279
00:59:44,748 --> 00:59:46,716
Then they came.

280
00:59:46,875 --> 00:59:49,674
(people screaming)

281
00:59:52,297 --> 00:59:54,925
In a way, we were lucky.

282
00:59:55,092 --> 00:59:57,186
We were able to regain control

283
00:59:57,344 --> 00:59:59,767
and defend ourselves.

284
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:04,651
I know not every village
was as fortunate.

285
01:00:08,188 --> 01:00:10,065
When it started,

286
01:00:10,232 --> 01:00:12,451
I came back to find my family...

287
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:15,283
my wife.

288
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:17,197
Did you find her?

289
01:00:19,783 --> 01:00:22,127
Yes, I found her.

290
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:28,174
In God's name,
what is happening to us?

291
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:31,007
(sighs)

292
01:00:31,169 --> 01:00:34,298
Maybe we're being punished
for our arrogance.

293
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:36,307
Perhaps

294
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:38,639
nature has put in motion

295
01:00:38,802 --> 01:00:41,806
the ultimate solution to its problem.

296
01:00:41,972 --> 01:00:45,476
Man's greed has devoured this earth.

297
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:51,064
Nature is restoring

298
01:00:51,231 --> 01:00:53,484
its delicate balance.

299
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:55,948
- (men speak native language)
- (gunshots)

300
01:00:57,487 --> 01:00:59,740
- They won't get through.
- But for how long?

301
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:02,034
I promised my people
I would protect them.

302
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:03,702
But I think you...

303
01:01:03,869 --> 01:01:06,372
My family has lived here
for generations.

304
01:01:06,538 --> 01:01:08,336
I was born here

305
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:11,172
and I will die here.

306
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:19,513
- (people chattering)
- (women crying)

307
01:01:41,656 --> 01:01:43,704
(exhales)

308
01:01:48,872 --> 01:01:51,125
(moans)

309
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:06,724
(children laughing)

310
01:02:13,855 --> 01:02:15,232
(whispering in native language)

311
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:18,242
(witch doctor speaking rapidly)

312
01:02:53,853 --> 01:02:56,606
(witch doctor
continues speaking)

313
01:02:58,817 --> 01:03:00,865
(witch doctor stops)

314
01:03:49,951 --> 01:03:52,249
(chickens clucking)

315
01:03:52,412 --> 01:03:54,665
The fever has broken.

316
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:56,833
It's time to leave.

317
01:04:14,142 --> 01:04:15,394
(exhales)

318
01:04:25,153 --> 01:04:27,201
(birds twittering)

319
01:04:42,837 --> 01:04:45,090
Hey, take it easy.

320
01:04:56,226 --> 01:04:58,274
(engine grinding)

321
01:05:04,818 --> 01:05:06,866
(engine stops)

322
01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:22,339
(steam hissing)

323
01:05:34,889 --> 01:05:36,607
I'm sorry.

324
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:38,814
I just want to get to my son.

325
01:05:41,104 --> 01:05:44,108
Yeah, don't worry about it.

326
01:05:44,274 --> 01:05:47,198
We'll get there.

327
01:05:54,451 --> 01:05:56,203
We cannot stay here.

328
01:05:56,369 --> 01:05:59,589
Well, we've lost most of the coolant.

329
01:06:02,459 --> 01:06:04,427
If we try to run this engine

330
01:06:04,586 --> 01:06:07,556
for more than a few minutes,
we'll fry it.

331
01:06:07,714 --> 01:06:10,342
We've got to get this
back on tight.

332
01:06:10,508 --> 01:06:12,385
(grunts)

333
01:06:12,552 --> 01:06:15,021
Then we've got to fill it
with water.

334
01:06:24,439 --> 01:06:26,282
Stop.

335
01:06:26,441 --> 01:06:28,614
There's no waterhole
along this road for many miles.

336
01:06:28,776 --> 01:06:30,744
This water is all we have.

337
01:06:30,904 --> 01:06:33,498
Well, we need to get water in this
or we walk.

338
01:06:33,656 --> 01:06:35,658
We can't drive without it.

339
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:38,328
What if it doesn't work?

340
01:06:38,495 --> 01:06:40,497
What, would you rather walk

341
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:42,665
under this heat
for I don't know how many miles?

342
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:45,085
Then we're left here
with no water and no car.

343
01:06:45,251 --> 01:06:47,549
We don't have time to discuss this.

344
01:06:47,712 --> 01:06:49,680
We can't make it out on foot.

345
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:53,013
This is the best chance we've got.

346
01:07:07,398 --> 01:07:09,366
It's not enough.

347
01:07:09,526 --> 01:07:10,778
Come on.

348
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:20,044
All right, all right.

349
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:39,897
- (cocks gun)
- (gunshot)

350
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:42,400
Come on, save your ammo.

351
01:07:46,145 --> 01:07:48,773
(engine grinding)

352
01:07:52,235 --> 01:07:54,237
(engine starts)

353
01:09:14,942 --> 01:09:17,161
Is it safe to drink?

354
01:09:25,078 --> 01:09:26,250
It's safe.

355
01:10:49,746 --> 01:10:51,748
(mud)

356
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:01,257
(moans)

357
01:11:05,928 --> 01:11:07,805
Oh shit.

358
01:11:07,972 --> 01:11:10,191
Looks like we've busted the axle.

359
01:11:10,349 --> 01:11:14,695
(moaning)

360
01:11:14,854 --> 01:11:17,107
Are you all right?

361
01:11:18,608 --> 01:11:20,360
(rustling)

362
01:11:38,085 --> 01:11:40,383
I can't see anything.

363
01:11:40,546 --> 01:11:42,093
Turn the lights on.

364
01:11:42,256 --> 01:11:44,805
With the lights on
we're attracting attention.

365
01:11:44,967 --> 01:11:47,015
The lights will draw them in.

366
01:11:47,178 --> 01:11:49,101
(rustling)

367
01:11:49,263 --> 01:11:50,981
We are blind.
How do we defend ourselves?

368
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:53,268
Shh. Listen.

369
01:11:57,563 --> 01:11:59,406
- Turn the lights on.
- No.

370
01:11:59,565 --> 01:12:02,535
- Turn them on.
- No, it will draw them in.

371
01:12:02,693 --> 01:12:04,570
(shouts)
Turn them on!

372
01:12:07,365 --> 01:12:09,743
Get out now.

373
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:13,504
- (snarling)
- Get out! Get out!

374
01:12:17,792 --> 01:12:20,011
(two gunshots)

375
01:13:00,877 --> 01:13:02,925
(insects chirping)

376
01:13:17,101 --> 01:13:19,445
I haven't seen any for a while.

377
01:13:20,938 --> 01:13:22,861
Let's chance a fire.

378
01:13:23,024 --> 01:13:25,368
I've really got to eat something.

379
01:13:26,569 --> 01:13:28,071
All right.

380
01:13:48,007 --> 01:13:50,977
(metallic jingling)

381
01:14:07,693 --> 01:14:10,162
(distant dogs baying)

382
01:14:26,671 --> 01:14:28,173
What's that?

383
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:33,014
An ancient symbol...

384
01:14:33,177 --> 01:14:35,930
timbu.
It means hope.

385
01:14:40,059 --> 01:14:42,653
This has been in my family
for generations.

386
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:47,029
My father gave it to me
before he died.

387
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:54,119
I too will pass it on to my son.

388
01:14:58,494 --> 01:15:00,417
Do you have a son?

389
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:06,510
I had a son.

390
01:15:08,212 --> 01:15:10,431
And I have a wife and a daughter.

391
01:15:10,589 --> 01:15:13,934
Since the networks have gone down,
I haven't been able to contact them.

392
01:15:14,093 --> 01:15:16,812
I don't know if they're okay.

393
01:15:16,971 --> 01:15:20,350
I don't even know
how far this thing has spread.

394
01:15:26,689 --> 01:15:29,192
What's that just before the desert?

395
01:15:31,235 --> 01:15:33,988
That is what you would call
the Devil's Claw...

396
01:15:34,155 --> 01:15:37,955
miles of jagged rocks
we must climb to get to the desert.

397
01:15:38,117 --> 01:15:40,165
Even the nomads

398
01:15:40,327 --> 01:15:42,705
would not cross that.

399
01:15:47,585 --> 01:15:49,587
How many rounds you got?

400
01:15:52,214 --> 01:15:54,592
Not enough.

401
01:15:56,260 --> 01:15:58,308
Same here.

402
01:16:07,188 --> 01:16:10,237
It's getting cold.

403
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:12,822
It's getting real cold.

404
01:16:49,772 --> 01:16:52,992
(jingling)

405
01:16:56,403 --> 01:16:58,826
(clanging)

406
01:17:05,830 --> 01:17:08,253
(snarling)

407
01:17:08,415 --> 01:17:10,338
- (screams)
- Daniel!

408
01:17:13,003 --> 01:17:16,132
(Daniel screaming)

409
01:17:38,654 --> 01:17:40,577
Daniel!

410
01:18:51,018 --> 01:18:53,737
You saved my life.

411
01:19:00,986 --> 01:19:03,284
Don't be sad, brother.

412
01:19:07,701 --> 01:19:11,205
I'll soon join my wife Jindibah.

413
01:19:19,588 --> 01:19:23,263
I just want you...

414
01:19:25,344 --> 01:19:29,565
not to let my soul...

415
01:19:32,017 --> 01:19:35,146
wander this earth.

416
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:01,509
I'm sorry, Daniel.

417
01:20:04,383 --> 01:20:06,431
(wings flutter)

418
01:20:11,765 --> 01:20:13,642
(gunshot)

419
01:20:13,809 --> 01:20:15,982
(wings flutter)

420
01:21:33,013 --> 01:21:35,061
(footsteps)

421
01:22:31,363 --> 01:22:33,365
(Brian whispers)
No.

422
01:22:58,765 --> 01:23:01,359
Woman: Hey. Hey.

423
01:23:03,145 --> 01:23:06,445
Hey.
(speaking native language)

424
01:23:06,607 --> 01:23:09,030
(baby crying)

425
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:26,377
Get up.
Come on, we've got to go.

426
01:23:26,543 --> 01:23:27,920
- Come on, come on, let's go.
- No.

427
01:23:28,086 --> 01:23:30,339
- Come on, yes.
- (speaking native language)

428
01:23:30,506 --> 01:23:32,099
What?

429
01:23:33,509 --> 01:23:34,726
What?

430
01:23:34,885 --> 01:23:38,105
No no no, let's go.
Come on, get up.

431
01:23:38,263 --> 01:23:40,311
No, I'm not taking your baby.
Come on, let's go.

432
01:23:40,474 --> 01:23:44,229
(baby crying)

433
01:23:46,522 --> 01:23:47,774
No, I don't... l...

434
01:23:53,529 --> 01:23:56,123
- No.
- (shouting)

435
01:23:57,449 --> 01:23:59,451
No.

436
01:24:21,598 --> 01:24:23,726
(baby continues crying)

437
01:24:23,892 --> 01:24:26,520
(gunshot)

438
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:34,153
Come on, it's okay.

439
01:24:34,319 --> 01:24:36,321
Shh.

440
01:25:01,972 --> 01:25:04,020
(flies buzzing)

441
01:26:56,086 --> 01:26:58,384
(wings flutter)

442
01:27:07,889 --> 01:27:09,732
(gasps)

443
01:27:09,891 --> 01:27:11,393
(sighs)

444
01:28:54,913 --> 01:28:57,792
Daniel's voice:
The Devil's Claw...

445
01:28:57,958 --> 01:29:01,633
miles of jagged rocks we must climb
to get to the desert.

446
01:29:46,715 --> 01:29:48,763
(wind whistling)

447
01:31:50,338 --> 01:31:52,386
(panting)

448
01:32:51,107 --> 01:32:53,155
(exhales)

449
01:34:40,550 --> 01:34:43,178
(rapid gunfire)

450
01:34:43,344 --> 01:34:46,723
(gunfire continues)

451
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:11,168
(people chattering)

452
01:35:53,122 --> 01:35:55,045
Woman:
There are more coming, are there?

453
01:35:56,501 --> 01:35:59,050
I knew the Americans were coming.

454
01:36:31,119 --> 01:36:34,293
Do you have aircraft?
Do any planes land here with supplies?

455
01:36:34,455 --> 01:36:37,925
No, they come by road

456
01:36:38,084 --> 01:36:40,303
with any survivors.

457
01:36:40,461 --> 01:36:42,680
The two last ones have not returned.

458
01:36:48,136 --> 01:36:50,355
We are controlling the numbers,

459
01:36:50,513 --> 01:36:53,483
but we can't keep shooting.

460
01:36:53,641 --> 01:36:57,191
We are low on supplies.

461
01:36:59,272 --> 01:37:01,240
Do you have any
communications equipment?

462
01:37:01,399 --> 01:37:03,493
Yes, we have radio equipment,

463
01:37:03,651 --> 01:37:06,746
but it's no longer working.

464
01:37:29,802 --> 01:37:32,271
This is flight engineer
Lieutenant Brian Murphy.

465
01:37:32,430 --> 01:37:34,683
Can anybody hear me?

466
01:37:34,849 --> 01:37:36,851
(radio waves hissing)

467
01:37:39,187 --> 01:37:41,781
This is flight engineer
Lieutenant Brian Murphy.

468
01:37:41,939 --> 01:37:44,283
Can anyone hear me?

469
01:37:45,276 --> 01:37:47,904
This is flight engineer
Lieutenant Brian Murphy.

470
01:37:48,071 --> 01:37:50,073
Can anyone hear me?

471
01:37:51,074 --> 01:37:53,748
This is flight engineer
Lieutenant Brian Murphy.

472
01:37:53,910 --> 01:37:55,958
Can anyone hear me?

473
01:37:57,580 --> 01:37:59,332
Murphy.

474
01:38:01,084 --> 01:38:03,758
My God, you're still alive.

475
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:06,969
Frank? Frank Greaves?

476
01:38:07,131 --> 01:38:08,929
We thought you died in the crash.

477
01:38:09,092 --> 01:38:11,015
Oh, man, it's so good
to hear your voice.

478
01:38:11,177 --> 01:38:13,225
Listen to me.
I don't have much time.

479
01:38:13,388 --> 01:38:16,437
I need a plane.
I need supplies.

480
01:38:16,599 --> 01:38:18,476
Brian,

481
01:38:18,643 --> 01:38:20,862
no one's gonna send a plane.

482
01:38:21,020 --> 01:38:23,364
We're at breaking point here.

483
01:38:23,523 --> 01:38:25,525
Everyone's trying to get out.

484
01:38:26,567 --> 01:38:29,036
Where to, I don't know.

485
01:38:31,197 --> 01:38:34,076
There's nowhere left to go.

486
01:38:34,242 --> 01:38:35,664
The power's down.

487
01:38:35,827 --> 01:38:38,671
We're running
off standby generators.

488
01:38:38,830 --> 01:38:40,832
I don't know how much longer
we can hold them back.

489
01:38:40,998 --> 01:38:43,342
What about my family, Frank?

490
01:38:46,003 --> 01:38:48,097
I'm sorry, Brian.

491
01:38:48,256 --> 01:38:50,600
They're gone.

492
01:38:50,758 --> 01:38:52,760
What do you mean, gone?

493
01:38:52,927 --> 01:38:55,180
That noise you hear...

494
01:38:55,346 --> 01:38:57,599
that's them.

495
01:39:00,268 --> 01:39:01,315
(crash)

496
01:39:01,477 --> 01:39:03,900
The desks...
stow them against the door.

497
01:39:04,063 --> 01:39:05,610
- (people shouting)
- (pounding)

498
01:39:05,773 --> 01:39:07,616
I'm sorry, Murphy,

499
01:39:07,775 --> 01:39:11,029
but I have to go now.

500
01:39:11,195 --> 01:39:12,993
No. No, Frank, wait.

501
01:39:13,156 --> 01:39:15,284
May God be with us.

502
01:39:19,287 --> 01:39:21,130
Wait.

503
01:39:33,092 --> 01:39:35,390
(pounding)

504
01:39:39,932 --> 01:39:42,230
(pounding)

505
01:39:46,522 --> 01:39:48,399
(women crying)

506
01:39:53,362 --> 01:39:55,660
(people screaming)

507
01:40:59,428 --> 01:41:01,806
Daniel's voice:
Timbu... it means hope.

508
01:41:54,233 --> 01:41:56,406
(upbeat music playing)
