See...

2
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:05,482
...man ain't like a dog.

3
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:07,943
And when I say "man,"

4
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:11,947
I'm talking about man
as in mankind, not man as in men.

5
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:13,574
Because men,

6
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:16,034
well, we a lot like a dog.

7
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:19,121
You know, we like to piss on things.

8
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:21,665
Sniff a bitch when we can.

9
00:01:21,874 --> 00:01:24,877
Even get a little pink hard-on
the way they do.

10
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:28,881
We territorial as shit, you know,
we gonna protect our own.

11
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:31,091
But man...

12
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,886
...he know about death.

13
00:01:34,303 --> 00:01:36,680
Got him a sense of history.

14
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:38,724
Got religion.

15
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,350
See...

16
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:42,060
...a dog...

17
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:46,732
Man, a dog don't know shit
about no birthdays or Christmas

18
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,026
or Easter bunny, none of that shit.

19
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,736
And one day
God gonna come calling,

20
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:53,238
so, you know,
they going through life carefree.

21
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:56,742
But people like you and me, man,
we always guessing.

22
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:00,204
Wondering, "What if?"
You know what I mean?

23
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,041
So when you say to me,

24
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:05,918
"Hey, I don't think
we should be doing this,"

25
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:09,213
I gotta say, baby, I don't think
we need to be doing this neither,

26
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:12,299
but we ain't gonna get no move on
in this world, lying around in the sun,

27
00:02:12,508 --> 00:02:14,468
licking our ass all day.

28
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:16,428
I mean, we man.

29
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:20,432
I mean, you a woman and all,
but we man.

30
00:02:21,517 --> 00:02:23,560
So with this said...

31
00:02:24,228 --> 00:02:29,107
...you tell me what it is
you wanna do with your life.

32
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:44,373
I don't know.

33
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:48,627
- I mean, I guess I could, like...
- Hold up a second.

34
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,300
What's happening with you, man?

35
00:02:57,678 --> 00:02:59,972
You like what you see, huh?

36
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:04,810
Look here, baby,
it break down like this:

37
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,479
Twenty in the front, 40 in the back.

38
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:10,649
Hello?

39
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:16,238
Why don't you walk over there
and explain it to that motherfucker.

40
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:41,281
- Damn.
<i>- From the D&Z sports desk,</i>

41
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,033
<i>I'm Dennis Phillippi, and the answer...</i>

42
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:49,122
<i>- Hot 107. 1, number one for hip-hop...</i>
- Nothing but a bunch of jive and junk.

43
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:51,333
<i>Coming up, your chance</i>
<i>to win a trip to Las Vegas.</i>

44
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:55,546
<i>Holler at your boy, it's Hot 107. 1.</i>

45
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:17,276
- Please! Fucking with me, man! Hey!
- Hey, hey, hey!

46
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:18,569
Hey, what the hell?!

47
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:20,821
- Pull that shit again,
- Motherfucker, how you like that?

48
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,364
Boot your ass to hell.

49
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,449
- You heard me!
- Get the fuck up out of here.

50
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,785
Deranged son of a bitch!

51
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:35,586
- You all right, Nola?
- Thanks, D.

52
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:39,131
Come on in, man. Come on in here.

53
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,842
Damn, man, you gotta
get some security up in here.

54
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,511
I'm the only
motherfucking security in here.

55
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,807
Sure is good
not to be cracking heads.

56
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:50,893
So, what you need, man,
a half or full O?

57
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:54,688
Ounce will do good.
Fourth coming up and all.

58
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:56,773
Righteous, man.

59
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:58,650
Hey, you remember
that sticky herb you brung up

60
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:00,944
to my brother's house for playoffs?

61
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:05,157
Yeah, I remember that shit.
That ain't this, now, man.

62
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:08,368
We talking about... That's
a whole other zip-up bag on that.

63
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:10,204
That's fucking prime product
right there.

64
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:13,790
We got some big company
coming in here for the Fourth.

65
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:16,627
Thought you may want
to get you some money.

66
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:18,420
- Big company?
- Yeah.

67
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:21,548
- Like what?
- You know Skinny Black?

68
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:23,258
Skinny Black.

69
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:25,385
Yeah, that...
Yeah, I know who Skinny is, man.

70
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:27,679
I know Skinny from
way back in the day.

71
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:30,140
See, I know Skinny
when he was hustling

72
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:32,851
his underground tapes
down at the drive-in,

73
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,312
out the back of his Cutlass.

74
00:06:35,521 --> 00:06:39,066
Not no more he ain't.
Last one he put out went platinum.

75
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:41,568
- Platinum?
- Yeah.

76
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:44,530
- That's more special than gold, right?
- But he's still in Memphis.

77
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:47,616
He and his brother Tigga hook up with
their friends every Fourth of July.

78
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:50,744
I shut the place down,
make it all private for them.

79
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,663
And they just buy me out.

80
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:54,540
- Bullshit.
- No shit.

81
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,250
Yo, Skinny rolling like that, man?

82
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:59,336
Best get your ass up here
with that good shit.

83
00:06:59,545 --> 00:07:01,421
Those boys don't want
none of this dirt weed.

84
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:03,757
So you're trying
to hurt my feelings, right?

85
00:07:03,966 --> 00:07:07,261
- Just trying to help out a friend.
- For sure, man.

86
00:07:16,812 --> 00:07:18,897
All right, all right, all right,
goddamn it,

87
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:22,526
we're going into a 2-for-1
for all you balling motherfuckers.

88
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:23,861
You gonna love this shit.

89
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:27,322
These lovely ladies will be doing
two dances for the price of one.

90
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:30,284
We got Luscious, we got Phoebe
and we got Lexus

91
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:32,452
coming up to satellite one.

92
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:34,329
- Mike.
- What up, D?

93
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:36,248
- What's happening, baby?
- Wet out there, huh?

94
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,457
Yeah, sorry, man.

95
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,501
- It's like a motherfucker.
- All right.

96
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:46,508
Hey, baby.

97
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,054
- Hey, where Lex at?
- Over there on satellite one.

98
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:55,100
Don't miss out. Take advantage.

99
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:58,437
We got Monique coming up
on satellite one.

100
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,363
- You'll love this, 2-for-1.
- What the fuck? Will you let me...

101
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:12,242
These lovely ladies will be giving you
two dances for the price of one.

102
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:15,537
- Come here. Excuse me, daddy.
- Don't you see me on a hustle?

103
00:08:15,746 --> 00:08:17,164
- Where you at?
- I ain't at shit.

104
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:18,957
- I was on my third dance.
- Don't tell me...

105
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,168
You think I can just run up in here,
snap my fingers

106
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:23,378
and make these motherfuckers
throw their money at me?

107
00:08:23,587 --> 00:08:27,216
- Watch your motherfucking tone...
- I ain't even made payout yet!

108
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:29,051
This one is pretty good.

109
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:31,762
My motherfucking house
got broken into too, bitch.

110
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,430
- Hell, no.
- Hell, yeah, they kicked

111
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:37,518
both my doors in, girl. Stole the last
pound of hydro weed for the party.

112
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,103
You hear that?

113
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:43,857
That's my gut saying,
"Hurry the fuck up," okay?

114
00:08:45,943 --> 00:08:47,402
- Come on.
- Look at this.

115
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:51,031
Hell, no. Look at this shit. What
the fuck you call that, the clapper?

116
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:54,076
Lights on, lights off. Don't play.
I'm gonna roll tonight.

117
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:58,580
I don't care what you say, D,
I ain't working day shift no more.

118
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,834
I don't care if I got to
take me a taxi ride home.

119
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:04,878
- You gonna work if I say you gonna.
- I ain't working with these skank-ass,

120
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:07,714
- trucker-bait ho's no more.
- Kiss my ass.

121
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:10,467
- Bitch, fucking take my shit again.
- Shit don't make no sense.

122
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:14,054
If I'd known y'all was gonna take your
sweet fucking time, I'd have come in.

123
00:09:14,263 --> 00:09:17,349
Trudy says she made $500
last night, $500, you heard me?

124
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:19,977
- Bitch got that birthmark on her face?
- Five hundred dollars

125
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:22,354
for dancing for some man
who makes cotton.

126
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:24,606
- What she do for him? She tricking.
- It ain't fair.

127
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:27,025
I'm tricking! I ain't making $500.

128
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:28,360
- What the hell, fool?!
- Hey!

129
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:30,320
- D. Djay.
- Get your ass away from our car.

130
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:32,906
- What the fuck's wrong with you?
- Hey, D!

131
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,367
- It's only me, it's Harold.
- Get the fuck away from my car!

132
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:37,536
- It's me, Harold, Djay.
- Get away from my car, man.

133
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,162
- It's your dog.
- You're lucky as shit,

134
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:42,541
that's normally my barrels
under my fucking seat, motherfucker.

135
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:46,503
- It's Djay, nigga!
- Okay, Djay, I didn't mean no harm.

136
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:48,547
You got any of
that crankity-crank shit?

137
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:51,550
Nigga, I'm gateway mother... Man,
don't waste my time on no bullshit.

138
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,886
Wait, wait, wait. Check this out.
Check this out.

139
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,554
Check this out.
What can I get for this?

140
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,598
You think I look like
a pawnshop, man?

141
00:09:57,806 --> 00:09:59,808
Is that..? I got "pawnshop"
written on my forehead?

142
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:02,227
Come on, Djay, fuck with me.

143
00:10:02,436 --> 00:10:04,813
- Fuck with me, Djay.
- Where you get it?

144
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:06,940
You know the business.

145
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:09,943
- You took that shit from little kids?
- No, none of that, man.

146
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:13,113
I used to play this thing myself,
all the time.

147
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:16,366
- That shit work?
- Man, like a pro!

148
00:10:18,202 --> 00:10:20,454
Let me see that motherfucker, man.

149
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:26,460
Yeah, man, I used to have
one of these when I was a little kid.

150
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:31,590
- Shit wasn't as big, though.
- But that's bigger and better.

151
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:32,841
Fuck with me, now, D.

152
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,761
- Fuck with me, Djay!
- Shut the fuck up, man.

153
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:39,765
- Nigga, I'll give you a quarter for it.
- A quarter?

154
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:43,060
Man, you mean a half and some. I can
get more than that at the pawnshop.

155
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:45,479
Take that shit to the pawnshop,
let's see what you get.

156
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:47,898
No, take it over there, man.
Give them your thumbprint.

157
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:51,318
- You on. You got it, you got it.
- Hey, give me that bag, man.

158
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:53,320
Shit.

159
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:56,114
You the man. You got it going on.
It's all good.

160
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:57,950
Nigga, you advertising my shit
right now.

161
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:00,244
It's okay, I'm gonna
fuck with you anyhow. It's all good.

162
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:02,663
You fucking with me already.

163
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:18,178
Hey, Stevie Wonder!

164
00:11:18,554 --> 00:11:20,597
We hungry.

165
00:11:26,395 --> 00:11:28,230
<i>Motherfucking Carl Lewis</i>
<i>or something.</i>

166
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:32,526
I called the power company about
getting an extension on the light bill.

167
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:35,821
They say I gotta come down there,
stand in line.

168
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:38,240
I can't be standing in line
how they do down there,

169
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,617
not if I got Roger with me.

170
00:11:40,826 --> 00:11:42,452
You know, D?

171
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:48,166
<i>Man, it's Skinny goddamn Black,</i>
<i>you know...</i>

172
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,627
Hey! There goes Skinny Black, man.

173
00:11:50,836 --> 00:11:53,839
Hey, Lex. Lex, come here, baby!

174
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:57,759
Look right there, look at that.
That is Skinny Black, man.

175
00:11:57,968 --> 00:12:01,305
Me and him gonna be kicking it over
at Arnel's club on the Fourth of July.

176
00:12:01,513 --> 00:12:05,392
- Ain't that some shit, huh?
- Who, you?

177
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:08,145
Yeah, me and Skinny gonna do us
some little catching up.

178
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:11,398
So am I supposed to piss myself
or something?

179
00:12:13,192 --> 00:12:16,612
Okay, let's see who it is
that you know is somebody, huh?

180
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:21,366
Nobody in this here crib,
that's for damn sure.

181
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:24,703
- Where my baby, Roger, at?
- No, no, Lex, please!

182
00:12:24,912 --> 00:12:27,080
I just put him to sleep, Lex!

183
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:30,042
Skinny used to DJ over at Booker T.
The same way I did at Westwood.

184
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,044
D, I know it's my job and all...

185
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:33,921
Ain't like he the only nigga
can spit flow.

186
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:35,506
- But why she gotta wake Roger up?

187
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:37,925
Ain't like he the only nigga
can spit some flow.

188
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:39,218
D, I need time for me too,
now.

189
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:42,763
Shit, I was just doing the same thing,
just over at my school.

190
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:47,017
Ask anybody, man. Go ask Carlos
on the corner, he'd tell you.

191
00:12:47,226 --> 00:12:49,353
He was in my grade. Ask him.

192
00:12:49,895 --> 00:12:52,606
We gotta get that extension, D.

193
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:58,904
Fuck. Paper money. Shit.

194
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:01,532
<i>See, now, back in the day</i>
<i>you wouldn't even catch me</i>

195
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,951
<i>in this Bentley right here,</i>
<i>you'd catch me in a Crown Vic.</i>

196
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:07,663
Bitch. Shit, back in the day,

197
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:09,498
- I was triple platinum. Ask anyone.
- D.

198
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:12,668
- I think I'll take a shower. Here.
- I don't give a fuck, man.

199
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:15,170
- I need you to watch Roger for me.
- Hey, give him to Shug!

200
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:18,090
Shug say it's her chill time.
Come on.

201
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:21,051
When is my chill time?

202
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:29,768
Come on, man. Hey. Hey.
Hey, man. No, no, man.

203
00:13:29,977 --> 00:13:33,272
The bitch gotta go take a shower, man.
You relax your ass, man.

204
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,108
Come here. Come here, man.

205
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:39,653
Hey, man, you can't be
crying around like no bitch, man.

206
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,990
Hey. Hey, get rid
of them tears, man.

207
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:47,786
No. Cut them tears shit out, man.
Come on.

208
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:51,331
Come on. Come on.

209
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,001
Come on, come on. Here we go.
Here we go, man.

210
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:57,754
Come on, come on.
Let me try something.

211
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:02,843
All right, push that one.

212
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,148
Do that. What is this right here?

213
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:24,072
Hey, I like that, man. Do that again.

214
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:26,158
Listen to that, man.

215
00:14:27,242 --> 00:14:30,329
Now, that shit buck, ain't it, man?
Do it again, man.

216
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:32,539
What the fuck you doing
with my boy?

217
00:14:32,748 --> 00:14:34,541
- Come on, give him to me.
- We just playing.

218
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:35,792
- Give him to me.
- Come on...

219
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:38,337
- He don't need to be playing.
- That's what I'm talking about.

220
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:41,089
Every time he gets settled,
you gotta come fuck with him!

221
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:44,259
I'm telling you, you gonna
give that little boy a twitch!

222
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:06,865
Better go easy, girl.
Man can't be no open candy store.

223
00:15:07,074 --> 00:15:09,576
We tight this whole week.

224
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:14,081
Put your shine on, man.
I hear this one coming.

225
00:15:17,668 --> 00:15:19,711
What's happening with you, man?

226
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,381
Don't act scared, man,
she don't bite.

227
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:24,800
She just nibbles a little bit.

228
00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:30,138
Come on... Hey, hey. Damn.

229
00:15:30,347 --> 00:15:33,684
Why can't I work the motels
anymore, D? At least they got air.

230
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:35,894
At least they take a cut
is what they do.

231
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:39,565
Thirty dollars an hour
on top of what we already charging,

232
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:42,234
for what, a five-minute nut?

233
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,236
Taking money out of my pocket
trying to keep

234
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:45,737
your little country ass cool.

235
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:47,656
God, D, all I did was ask about a motel
and you get so ugly with me.

236
00:15:47,698 --> 00:15:49,366
God, D, all I did was ask about a motel
and you get so ugly with me.

237
00:15:49,575 --> 00:15:51,618
- He's coming back.
- I'm all wet and sticky.

238
00:15:51,827 --> 00:15:53,495
You gonna have to put a show on
for this one.

239
00:15:53,704 --> 00:15:56,957
Do that little shit you do
with your tongue.

240
00:15:57,374 --> 00:15:59,751
Now, come on, he's coming back.
Get your mind right, okay?

241
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,796
Come on, come on,
come on, come on. Fuck.

242
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:05,048
Fuck, man!

243
00:16:05,257 --> 00:16:08,010
How come Lex gets to work
out of that strip club, and I can't?

244
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:10,304
Because we done been over this
ten times, Nola.

245
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:12,264
You got what they call
a bad equilibrium.

246
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:15,267
And it ain't your fault,
you just knock into shit.

247
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,561
I put you on that stage
in them heels,

248
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:19,021
tricks gonna be yelling, "Timber."

249
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:22,691
I'm in heels out here every day.
You don't see me fall down once...

250
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:27,029
Because you sitting, Nola.
Ain't that much of a fall to the floor.

251
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:30,866
Lookit, why don't you just let me do
the thinking for you, okay?

252
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:33,660
You do what you do,
and you let me do what I do.

253
00:16:33,869 --> 00:16:36,788
One day, you'll have to tell me
about that.

254
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:38,707
About what?

255
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:41,460
What the fuck it is you do.

256
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:46,465
What did you just say to me?

257
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:52,387
Hi, honey.

258
00:16:54,515 --> 00:16:57,476
Wanna see me walk in these heels
all the way to your lap?

259
00:16:58,644 --> 00:17:00,479
I'll be right there.

260
00:17:04,775 --> 00:17:07,528
Looks like he got air in his car, D.

261
00:17:08,904 --> 00:17:10,489
Must be working hard as you.

262
00:17:56,118 --> 00:17:59,872
Fuck you doing, man?
Doing my job? I got a mop for you.

263
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,291
Elroy, I'm having me a day
that won't quit,

264
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:06,420
so I'll need you to shed
just a little light on me, okay?

265
00:18:06,837 --> 00:18:08,547
You got something for me?

266
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:13,051
Yeah. I got a grocery list for you too.
I need a...

267
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,429
A brick of that Big Easy bud.

268
00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:18,640
What the fuck is this, man?

269
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:21,768
Got your stank all over this.
I don't even like my own sweat, D.

270
00:18:21,977 --> 00:18:23,395
What the fuck is this?

271
00:18:24,688 --> 00:18:28,400
Okay. Let's do it this way, then.

272
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:32,237
Let's give it some
of my sweet juices on it...

273
00:18:34,156 --> 00:18:36,575
...and tell me you ain't
gonna take that.

274
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:41,246
You better watch yourself, D.

275
00:18:43,373 --> 00:18:45,584
Let me get you on your way.

276
00:18:47,836 --> 00:18:49,713
You cool yet?

277
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,976
You still into that shit, man?

278
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:07,773
I remember Coach Rosallis
used to let you flow

279
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:10,025
over the intercom in gym class,

280
00:19:10,234 --> 00:19:13,153
back when we used to beatbox
like the Fat Boys, remember that?

281
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:16,949
Dude, man,
we went to East Middle together.

282
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:19,243
Clyde. Called me Key.

283
00:19:19,451 --> 00:19:21,828
- Nigga, what's up, man?
- How you feeling, man?

284
00:19:22,037 --> 00:19:25,123
Yeah, you used to spin them
little records at the after-school joints.

285
00:19:25,332 --> 00:19:28,126
Yeah, yeah. It's not like I was
scratching or nothing like that.

286
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:31,296
I just made sure "Purple Rain"
got played for the ladies, that's all.

287
00:19:31,505 --> 00:19:34,466
- Let me get these batteries, man.
- "Purple Rain."

288
00:19:36,677 --> 00:19:39,304
Hey, give over, man. He cool. He cool.

289
00:19:39,513 --> 00:19:41,640
East Middle, man.
Them was the days, man.

290
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:44,142
- Yeah, man.
- Them was the days.

291
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:46,645
I see you still doing the same.

292
00:19:46,854 --> 00:19:49,648
Oh, yeah, you know,
like the post office:

293
00:19:49,857 --> 00:19:52,526
- Through rain, sleet or snow.
- You looking good, though, man.

294
00:19:52,734 --> 00:19:56,029
So, what, you got you
a dildo or something?

295
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,365
A do-what?

296
00:19:58,574 --> 00:20:01,118
I mean, what's all the batteries for?

297
00:20:01,785 --> 00:20:03,787
It ain't for no dildo,
I'll tell you that right now.

298
00:20:03,996 --> 00:20:06,373
- I'm just fucking with you, man.
- Okay, okay.

299
00:20:06,582 --> 00:20:08,709
They for my microphones, man.

300
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:11,170
- Microphones?
- Yeah.

301
00:20:11,712 --> 00:20:13,630
So, what do you do?

302
00:20:30,397 --> 00:20:34,193
<i>I told Jesus</i>

303
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:39,198
<i>It would be all right</i>

304
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:43,952
<i>If he changed my name</i>

305
00:20:50,459 --> 00:20:54,713
<i>I told Jesus</i>

306
00:20:54,922 --> 00:20:59,843
<i>It would be all right</i>

307
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:04,515
<i>If he changed my name</i>

308
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:14,650
<i>I told Jesus</i>

309
00:21:14,858 --> 00:21:19,905
<i>It would be all right</i>

310
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:26,453
<i>If he changed</i>

311
00:21:27,955 --> 00:21:32,709
<i>My name</i>

312
00:21:46,849 --> 00:21:50,435
<i>- Jesus told me</i>
<i>- Jesus</i>

313
00:21:51,144 --> 00:21:55,816
<i>That the world would be against me</i>

314
00:21:56,024 --> 00:22:03,991
<i>- If he changed</i>
<i>- Changed my</i>

315
00:22:04,199 --> 00:22:09,663
<i>My</i>

316
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:18,338
<i>Name</i>

317
00:22:28,849 --> 00:22:32,352
Hey, Shug. Shug.

318
00:22:32,936 --> 00:22:34,438
Wake up.

319
00:22:37,149 --> 00:22:38,901
What, I gotta watch the baby?

320
00:22:39,109 --> 00:22:41,320
No, everybody asleep.

321
00:22:46,325 --> 00:22:49,786
- So he kicking now, huh?
- Usually after I eat.

322
00:22:49,995 --> 00:22:52,998
He real active
during the day, though.

323
00:22:53,207 --> 00:22:56,877
He must get that after his daddy.
He sure don't get that from me.

324
00:22:58,045 --> 00:22:59,421
Whoever that is, huh?

325
00:23:03,091 --> 00:23:06,929
You know, Shug,
you and me, we got history, right?

326
00:23:07,888 --> 00:23:12,976
I mean, you been tricking for me
for a few now, so we got that, right?

327
00:23:14,394 --> 00:23:18,524
And me not pimping you
because of...

328
00:23:18,732 --> 00:23:20,776
...your demonstration,

329
00:23:20,984 --> 00:23:23,403
it just puts us in a whole...

330
00:23:28,575 --> 00:23:30,702
...different kind of place,
you know what I mean?

331
00:23:31,912 --> 00:23:33,539
You want me to leave.

332
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:37,709
Hell, no.

333
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:40,963
Why would you say
something like that?

334
00:23:44,383 --> 00:23:46,552
I just feel like...

335
00:23:47,052 --> 00:23:51,431
Like I'm having one of them
midlife crisis, you know?

336
00:23:54,852 --> 00:23:57,187
I mean, my daddy...

337
00:23:58,188 --> 00:24:01,441
...you know, his heart
gave out on him when he was, like...

338
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:05,737
Well, shit, when I was 12 years old.

339
00:24:05,946 --> 00:24:07,656
Shit, he was my age.

340
00:24:08,156 --> 00:24:09,658
And that shit just been...

341
00:24:09,867 --> 00:24:13,078
Just been fucking
with my mind, you know?

342
00:24:13,954 --> 00:24:16,957
It got me feeling
like this is it for me.

343
00:24:20,169 --> 00:24:23,839
I just don't know what
I'm supposed... Supposed to do.

344
00:24:27,885 --> 00:24:30,429
I get bad dreams.

345
00:24:31,096 --> 00:24:34,975
Dreams like me giving birth
to dead dogs.

346
00:24:35,684 --> 00:24:39,188
Sometimes I'm breast-feeding
a big old ugly catfish.

347
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,649
- For real?
- Yeah.

348
00:24:42,858 --> 00:24:46,987
But that's just my mind

349
00:24:47,196 --> 00:24:50,574
touching in on something
I ain't said yet.

350
00:24:51,825 --> 00:24:53,410
What's that?

351
00:25:01,502 --> 00:25:02,920
I'm scared, D.

352
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:08,634
Sometimes I just get so scared...

353
00:25:20,103 --> 00:25:22,147
<i>Most gracious and heavenly Father,</i>
<i>we pray that you</i>

354
00:25:22,356 --> 00:25:25,234
<i>bless this food and this house</i>
<i>in Jesus' name. Amen.</i>

355
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:27,694
Amen.

356
00:25:27,903 --> 00:25:30,364
So Beth Ann tells me

357
00:25:30,531 --> 00:25:33,158
the reason I didn't
get that sales-supervisor position

358
00:25:33,367 --> 00:25:35,369
is because she says I have issues

359
00:25:35,577 --> 00:25:38,372
enforcing company policy
with my coworkers,

360
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,707
who, by the way,
she referred to as my friends.

361
00:25:41,375 --> 00:25:43,335
Not "coworkers," mind you,
but "friends."

362
00:25:43,544 --> 00:25:45,796
And I said to her,
"Hey, just because I am pleasant

363
00:25:46,004 --> 00:25:48,882
and supportive does not mean
that I cannot crack a whip."

364
00:25:49,091 --> 00:25:50,592
Because, you know,
I can crack a whip.

365
00:25:51,426 --> 00:25:52,469
Yeah, you can, baby.

366
00:25:52,678 --> 00:25:55,264
Because what we talking about here,
huh? Folding some sweaters?

367
00:25:55,472 --> 00:25:57,975
Shoot, sales supervisors
don't even handle the safe.

368
00:25:58,183 --> 00:26:01,687
So I go in and I talk to Leonard.
Because he always talking about,

369
00:26:01,895 --> 00:26:03,981
"Come in and air your grievances,"
right? So I did.

370
00:26:04,189 --> 00:26:06,066
- What did he say?
- You know what he says to me?

371
00:26:06,275 --> 00:26:10,028
He says I am incapable of writing
somebody up because I'm so friendly.

372
00:26:10,237 --> 00:26:13,532
And I said,
"Hey, give me a pen, Leonard, okay?

373
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:16,034
I'll tell you everything
that everybody's doing wrong."

374
00:26:16,243 --> 00:26:19,663
What, Beth Ann, she take
way too long on her lunch break.

375
00:26:19,872 --> 00:26:24,126
Alan, that little shit down in Receiving
came to work the other day high.

376
00:26:24,334 --> 00:26:27,921
And Sally, just yesterday, came in with
this skirt with the discontinued line.

377
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:30,716
Remember that, baby?
Remember that little skirt I had?

378
00:26:30,924 --> 00:26:32,926
And I know she didn't pay for it.

379
00:26:33,093 --> 00:26:36,555
He think I'm gonna take some kind of
blind eye to all of these violations

380
00:26:36,763 --> 00:26:40,267
if I was sales supervisor
just because I'm nice?

381
00:26:43,687 --> 00:26:44,897
Clyde?

382
00:26:55,908 --> 00:26:58,452
- Damn.
- What the hell you doing here, Djay?

383
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:03,373
Hey, look here, baby. I know you about
sick and tired of seeing me right now,

384
00:27:03,582 --> 00:27:07,336
- but I just wanted to be able...
- Clyde. Who is it?

385
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:15,260
- It's just...
- Just an old school buddy, ma'am.

386
00:27:15,469 --> 00:27:19,181
- From back in the day.
- Well, we was just having dinner.

387
00:27:19,389 --> 00:27:22,309
I'm so sorry, y'all. And I'd have
left them in the car,

388
00:27:22,518 --> 00:27:24,311
but this one right here, man,
she just

389
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:27,022
sniff out an air-conditioning unit
like an old bloodhound bitch.

390
00:27:27,231 --> 00:27:30,400
Hey. Hey, man, respect my house.

391
00:27:30,609 --> 00:27:32,778
Look, man, anyplace you and me

392
00:27:32,986 --> 00:27:35,739
could just sit down
and talk for a minute?

393
00:27:35,948 --> 00:27:37,950
Djay, things don't always
come together

394
00:27:38,158 --> 00:27:40,786
just because you want them to,
all right, man?

395
00:27:40,994 --> 00:27:43,288
Look, just because you got the bacon,
the lettuce and tomato,

396
00:27:43,497 --> 00:27:46,750
hell, man, that don't mean
I'm gonna give you my toast.

397
00:27:47,251 --> 00:27:49,628
Look, man, I know you done learned
a whole mess of shit

398
00:27:49,837 --> 00:27:52,130
hustling out on the street, right?

399
00:27:52,589 --> 00:27:55,133
Let me tell you what I learned
while working on my job.

400
00:27:55,342 --> 00:27:57,886
- Thank you.
- There are two types of people:

401
00:27:58,095 --> 00:28:01,640
Those that talk the talk
and those that walk the walk.

402
00:28:01,849 --> 00:28:05,978
People who walk the walk,
they sometimes talk the talk.

403
00:28:06,186 --> 00:28:09,439
But most of the time, they don't
talk at all, because they walking.

404
00:28:10,357 --> 00:28:14,111
Now, people who talk the talk,
when it comes time for them to walk,

405
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:16,738
- you wanna know what they do?
- What is that?

406
00:28:16,947 --> 00:28:18,949
They talk people like me
into walking for them.

407
00:28:19,157 --> 00:28:21,535
Look, I'm just asking you...

408
00:28:22,411 --> 00:28:26,290
Just listen to what I got here,
man, all right? Just listen to it.

409
00:28:26,498 --> 00:28:31,044
And if you ain't... If you ain't feeling it,
man, I'm out your life, okay?

410
00:28:41,305 --> 00:28:43,390
So can I get y'all anything?

411
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,727
No, ma'am.

412
00:28:48,395 --> 00:28:50,856
Hey, I really like your hair.

413
00:28:51,231 --> 00:28:54,193
It's got some, like,
chocolate colors in it.

414
00:28:54,401 --> 00:28:56,445
Oh, thank you.

415
00:28:56,653 --> 00:28:59,156
I have this great guy that does it
over in Germantown,

416
00:28:59,364 --> 00:29:01,158
the coloring.

417
00:29:01,366 --> 00:29:03,410
- That sound all right.
- The whole time it's gonna have

418
00:29:03,619 --> 00:29:04,870
this thing going like:

419
00:29:08,457 --> 00:29:10,501
- Then I come in...
- When you gonna start a rhyme?

420
00:29:10,709 --> 00:29:14,046
Just gotta get my mode on, man,
just give me a second. All right.

421
00:29:14,254 --> 00:29:18,133
<i>These bitches pop it for some paper</i>
<i>Pop that ass for some cash flow</i>

422
00:29:18,342 --> 00:29:21,512
<i>Do it like I like it</i>
<i>And I give you what you ask for</i>

423
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,347
I try and do my hair
every couple of months

424
00:29:23,555 --> 00:29:26,058
because it keeps the tricks guessing.

425
00:29:26,266 --> 00:29:28,435
- You know?
- I'm sorry, keep the what?

426
00:29:28,977 --> 00:29:31,146
Well, my hair has to be redone a lot

427
00:29:31,688 --> 00:29:34,566
because these ain't me real braids,
these just extensions.

428
00:29:34,775 --> 00:29:38,737
Nola, would you just
shut the fuck up, please?

429
00:29:38,946 --> 00:29:42,449
What makes you think this lady
care about your kitchen-ass hairdo?

430
00:29:42,658 --> 00:29:45,827
I think, you know what, it's nice.
It's okay...

431
00:29:46,036 --> 00:29:49,540
Lady, you don't got to be nice to her
because she's sitting on your couch.

432
00:29:49,748 --> 00:29:53,627
You think her hair look like a wet
dust mop, go on and tell her so. I do.

433
00:29:53,836 --> 00:29:56,630
- Damn, Lex.
- Well, I didn't. I mean, I don't.

434
00:29:56,839 --> 00:29:58,507
Lex, why you gotta be so ugly?

435
00:29:58,715 --> 00:30:01,009
<i>Get a nigga minx</i>
<i>Grab her by the hand</i>

436
00:30:01,218 --> 00:30:04,388
<i>Take her back for some convo</i>
<i>Drop a couple grams</i>

437
00:30:04,596 --> 00:30:06,515
<i>Now you're back at the condo</i>

438
00:30:06,723 --> 00:30:09,268
- Ugly as a swamp-duck ho.
- God!

439
00:30:09,476 --> 00:30:11,603
Everybody else
says my hair looks sexy.

440
00:30:11,979 --> 00:30:14,106
And then they nut.

441
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,985
Clyde?

442
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:20,070
Clyde?

443
00:30:20,779 --> 00:30:22,948
<i>Real fast</i>
<i>Shake it, shake it real fast</i>

<i>Shake it, shake it real fast</i>

- No, man, I just...

447
00:30:32,833 --> 00:30:34,293
Clyde!

448
00:30:37,838 --> 00:30:39,673
What are you doing?

449
00:30:44,178 --> 00:30:45,762
Walking.

450
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:01,612
<i>I see you're down with that next nigga</i>
<i>Tryin' to make your chest bigger</i>

451
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:05,199
<i>See you're down with that next nigga</i>
<i>Tryin' to make your chest bigger</i>

452
00:31:05,407 --> 00:31:09,536
<i>Working on your flex</i>
<i>Figure what? Nigga, fuck that shit</i>

453
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:14,166
Let's get this to work, Djay.

454
00:31:31,391 --> 00:31:33,769
<i>The roadblock</i>

455
00:31:33,977 --> 00:31:37,314
<i>Got niggas jumpin' up</i>
<i>Tryin' to move the rock</i>

456
00:31:37,523 --> 00:31:41,693
It's like all my days, I've been
hearing this beat in my head, man,

457
00:31:41,902 --> 00:31:44,071
like a pounding.
I mean, sometimes it's real raw,

458
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:47,866
like a eightball joint, but then
sometimes, man, it get real soft,

459
00:31:48,075 --> 00:31:49,868
like Otis Redding and shit, man.

460
00:31:50,077 --> 00:31:51,995
<i>And this beat, this pounding, man,</i>

461
00:31:52,204 --> 00:31:57,292
<i>that's what I been calling my mode,</i>
<i>this feeling. And, Key, if my mode</i>

462
00:31:57,501 --> 00:32:00,254
is cracking, man,
it's like I can't be stopped, man.

463
00:32:00,462 --> 00:32:02,965
<i>It's like I'm Mike, and it's showtime.</i>

464
00:32:03,173 --> 00:32:05,592
<i>Nigga, it's on, you know what I mean?</i>
<i>You know?</i>

465
00:32:05,801 --> 00:32:07,553
<i>Because, shit, when I'm out here</i>
<i>on this track,</i>

466
00:32:07,761 --> 00:32:09,847
<i>I gotta keep my game tight, man.</i>

467
00:32:10,055 --> 00:32:13,517
<i>Because it's hard out here</i>
<i>for a pimp, man. For real, man.</i>

468
00:32:14,101 --> 00:32:16,728
Hold on, I like that, man.

469
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,940
"It's hard out here for a pimp."

470
00:32:22,818 --> 00:32:25,612
<i>Hot 107. 1. Big up to South Memphis</i>

471
00:32:25,821 --> 00:32:27,781
<i>I got your requests, and I got</i>
<i>that coming up for you.</i>

472
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:29,074
<i>Keep your radios locked.</i>

473
00:32:29,283 --> 00:32:31,410
This is messing with my mode.

474
00:32:33,787 --> 00:32:36,582
This is a bunch of bullshit, man.

475
00:32:37,374 --> 00:32:41,170
<i>This is all I got</i>
<i>So I keeps it hot</i>

<i>Read your post to plot</i>

477
00:32:45,674 --> 00:32:47,926
"Read your post to plot."

478
00:32:55,851 --> 00:32:58,103
Baby, this is some hard shit
right here.

479
00:32:58,312 --> 00:33:01,440
Trying to take what's
in your head, man,

480
00:33:01,648 --> 00:33:05,277
and put it into words that fit together
like a puzzle.

481
00:33:05,944 --> 00:33:07,321
So, you know...

482
00:33:07,529 --> 00:33:10,616
I wish there was something
I could do.

483
00:33:10,949 --> 00:33:13,243
You know, just...

484
00:33:13,994 --> 00:33:17,331
Shit, baby, you my whole operation.

485
00:33:18,332 --> 00:33:20,959
You might be what they call a...

486
00:33:21,668 --> 00:33:24,630
Like, a primary investor, you know?

487
00:33:24,838 --> 00:33:28,425
Making this shit happen
one trick at a time.

488
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:36,391
- Hey, Nola.
- What?

489
00:33:37,643 --> 00:33:39,102
Remember when I first met you?

490
00:33:39,853 --> 00:33:44,399
Right where I found you at?
Remember, you was at the truck stop?

491
00:33:44,775 --> 00:33:48,362
Smallest little lot lizard I'd ever seen,
tricking them truckers for change.

492
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:52,282
But you had balls, man.
Big gorilla balls.

493
00:33:53,367 --> 00:33:55,869
I got love for you, Nola.

494
00:33:56,954 --> 00:33:58,914
Big love.

495
00:33:59,456 --> 00:34:02,960
And I ain't talking about a way a man
love a woman or nothing like that.

496
00:34:03,168 --> 00:34:06,046
I'm talking about like a brother.

497
00:34:07,339 --> 00:34:09,174
Hey, do me a favor.

498
00:34:09,383 --> 00:34:12,094
I want you to put your hands
right here. Both of them.

499
00:34:18,225 --> 00:34:21,019
Now, I'm gonna put
my hands here too.

500
00:34:21,228 --> 00:34:23,605
Know what this means?

501
00:34:24,231 --> 00:34:25,899
What?

502
00:34:26,233 --> 00:34:28,610
It means we in charge.

503
00:34:30,195 --> 00:34:34,324
It means we got our hands
on the wheel. We in charge.

504
00:34:34,533 --> 00:34:37,452
Not them tricks out there, man.

505
00:34:37,661 --> 00:34:39,746
We in charge.

506
00:34:40,998 --> 00:34:43,375
I wanna hear you say it...

507
00:34:43,876 --> 00:34:47,254
...so I can believe in you
the same way you believe in me.

508
00:34:49,214 --> 00:34:51,258
We in charge.

509
00:34:51,884 --> 00:34:55,846
That's the best you can do?
Say it like you mean it.

510
00:34:56,972 --> 00:34:59,141
We in charge.

511
00:35:00,225 --> 00:35:01,560
<i>You said you was all right with this.</i>

512
00:35:01,935 --> 00:35:04,188
It's what you wanna hear, right?
So let's just drop it.

513
00:35:04,396 --> 00:35:06,982
No, Yevette.
I wanna hear what you really think.

514
00:35:07,191 --> 00:35:09,401
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

515
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:10,777
You say that,

516
00:35:10,986 --> 00:35:13,614
but I know you wanna hear what you
want, so that's what I'm gonna say.

517
00:35:13,822 --> 00:35:16,116
I'm sick and tired of people telling me
what I'm thinking,

518
00:35:16,325 --> 00:35:17,743
like I don't know my
own goddamned mind.

519
00:35:17,951 --> 00:35:19,953
Don't you dare take that tone
with me, Clyde, okay?

520
00:35:20,162 --> 00:35:22,706
- I have supported you in everything...
- We already discussed this!

521
00:35:22,915 --> 00:35:25,584
All right, fine! I'm thrilled!
Okay? Thrilled.

522
00:35:25,792 --> 00:35:27,920
What woman wouldn't want
her husband spending all his time

523
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:30,380
in a house full of ho's?

524
00:35:39,223 --> 00:35:41,475
What's all this shit again?

525
00:35:42,017 --> 00:35:46,230
Drink holders.
Poor man's soundproofing.

526
00:35:47,773 --> 00:35:50,108
So you ain't so dumb, huh?

527
00:35:52,194 --> 00:35:53,654
- D?
- What?

528
00:35:53,862 --> 00:35:56,448
There's someone at the door for you.

529
00:35:56,657 --> 00:35:58,784
Well, shit, baby, you know my rates.

530
00:36:00,077 --> 00:36:03,914
- I don't think he want no weed.
- Then wake Nola's ass up.

531
00:36:05,123 --> 00:36:07,334
- I don't think he want that either.
- Shit, man.

532
00:36:07,626 --> 00:36:09,878
We have to come up with some
fucking rules in this house!

533
00:36:10,087 --> 00:36:12,840
- Well, if you just tell me not to
- I wanna put a red light bulb up there

534
00:36:13,048 --> 00:36:15,509
- answer the door, that's fine with me.
- To say I'm working.

535
00:36:15,717 --> 00:36:17,636
- It ain't for me!
- Every time I'm fucking working,

536
00:36:17,845 --> 00:36:19,972
y'all come and bothering me.

537
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:22,015
Hey, man.

538
00:36:26,186 --> 00:36:29,147
You Mormons is some
brave motherfuckers.

539
00:36:30,023 --> 00:36:32,109
No, I'm Shelby.

540
00:36:32,317 --> 00:36:34,611
Okay, you Shelby.

541
00:36:35,529 --> 00:36:37,489
All right, look.
Hey, turntable's set up,

542
00:36:37,698 --> 00:36:40,659
and the mixer that D got
has room for four inputs.

543
00:36:40,868 --> 00:36:43,871
- Cool. You got a power strip?
- Oh, we tight.

544
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:45,914
How many outlets you need?

545
00:36:46,665 --> 00:36:50,002
- Three. I brought my MPC.
- Smart move.

546
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:52,004
Hey, Key.

547
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,549
Let me holler at you
for a second, man.

548
00:36:57,342 --> 00:37:00,179
- What's up, man?
- Who the fuck is this nigga, man?

549
00:37:00,387 --> 00:37:02,514
That's Shelby. He play piano
down in my church.

550
00:37:02,723 --> 00:37:06,768
You know, I figure we bring him in,
help him develop our sound.

551
00:37:08,228 --> 00:37:10,355
You know he white, right?

552
00:37:11,148 --> 00:37:13,901
No, he just light-skinned.

553
00:37:16,737 --> 00:37:18,947
Yo, peep. I got this shit right here
that...

554
00:37:19,156 --> 00:37:25,579
I keep this notepad
so that I can just jot down some shit.

555
00:37:26,246 --> 00:37:28,040
It's something...

556
00:37:30,292 --> 00:37:32,252
Get the fuck out of here, man.

557
00:37:35,923 --> 00:37:38,091
It go like this, man.

558
00:37:38,425 --> 00:37:41,428
Y'all sure y'all don't wanna, like,
burn one first, man?

559
00:37:41,595 --> 00:37:46,141
No, man. We can toke up later.
Let's hear what you got.

560
00:37:46,517 --> 00:37:49,895
Fine, man. I got...

561
00:37:50,938 --> 00:37:52,397
Okay.

562
00:37:56,068 --> 00:37:58,987
<i>I bet you won't beat that bitch</i>
<i>Whoop that bitch</i>

563
00:37:59,196 --> 00:38:03,242
<i>Got me acting buck and shit</i>
<i>Ho's telling me to calm down</i>

564
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:04,660
<i>But I'm like, "Fuck that shit"</i>

565
00:38:04,868 --> 00:38:08,413
<i>I'm already on that Hpnotiq</i>
<i>And that Grey Goose</i>

566
00:38:08,622 --> 00:38:11,500
<i>A couple of shots of Hen</i>
<i>That just gave me a...</i>

567
00:38:11,708 --> 00:38:13,418
What the fuck wrong?
You don't like that shit?

568
00:38:13,627 --> 00:38:16,129
- No, D, look.
- I got other shit, man.

569
00:38:16,338 --> 00:38:20,008
- No, look... It's okay, man.
- I think that's tight.

570
00:38:20,717 --> 00:38:22,553
It's just that we want radio play, right?

571
00:38:22,761 --> 00:38:25,097
You got a song called
"Beat That Bitch,"

572
00:38:25,305 --> 00:38:27,099
they might hear that
and think that's degrading.

573
00:38:27,307 --> 00:38:28,976
But that's if you're calling
a woman a bitch.

574
00:38:29,184 --> 00:38:30,978
This sounds like a
tearing-the-club-up song.

575
00:38:31,186 --> 00:38:32,938
Man, I ain't trying to call no ho
no bitch.

576
00:38:33,146 --> 00:38:35,440
Yeah, I mean, besides,
most of the bitches I know are guys.

577
00:38:35,649 --> 00:38:37,526
Look, man, y'all preaching to the choir,
all right?

578
00:38:37,734 --> 00:38:40,404
If you had to say something different,
other than "beat that bitch,"

579
00:38:40,654 --> 00:38:41,947
what would you say?

580
00:38:42,155 --> 00:38:45,617
I don't know. Shit. Stuff like...

581
00:38:46,201 --> 00:38:48,328
"Stomp that ho."

582
00:38:48,537 --> 00:38:50,163
- Who gonna play that?
- Fuck.

583
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:53,792
- Shit, "whoop that trick."
- No, no, no.

584
00:38:54,001 --> 00:38:55,043
- Go back.
- What?

585
00:38:55,252 --> 00:38:56,962
- "Whoop that trick."
- That's it.

586
00:38:58,505 --> 00:39:00,799
- Like what?
- Like a chant, man.

587
00:39:01,008 --> 00:39:02,968
<i>- Whoop that trick</i>
- Whoop that trick?

Come on, Shel, find it, man. Find it.

599
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:34,416
Speed it up. Speed it up.

600
00:39:36,418 --> 00:39:37,544
There you go.

601
00:39:43,467 --> 00:39:45,511
I like that clap.

602
00:39:57,564 --> 00:39:59,691
Not bad to be light-skinned, huh?

It's nice to have company, huh?

645
00:42:16,578 --> 00:42:18,747
Thank you.

646
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,211
See, the thing is...

647
00:42:25,003 --> 00:42:29,049
And I believe this, man.... Rap is
coming back home to the South.

648
00:42:29,258 --> 00:42:30,676
- Yeah, man.
- Because this, man...

649
00:42:30,884 --> 00:42:32,761
This is where it all began.

650
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:37,182
Heavy percussion, repetitive hooks,
sexually suggestive lyrics.

651
00:42:37,391 --> 00:42:39,726
Man, it's all blues, brother.

652
00:42:39,935 --> 00:42:42,187
"Back Door Man" to
"Back That Ass Up."

653
00:42:42,396 --> 00:42:46,650
It's all about pain and...
And pussy.

654
00:42:46,859 --> 00:42:50,112
Sorry, baby. And making music, man.

655
00:42:50,571 --> 00:42:53,824
With simple tools,
by any means necessary.

656
00:42:54,032 --> 00:42:58,370
You've got to get what you got to say
out because you got to.

657
00:42:58,579 --> 00:43:00,330
Every man, you know
what I'm saying?

658
00:43:00,539 --> 00:43:06,378
Every man has the right,
the goddamn right...

659
00:43:07,921 --> 00:43:09,548
...to contribute a verse.

660
00:43:12,801 --> 00:43:15,262
<i>- Number one for hip-hop. This</i>
<i>your man Boogaloo in the house.</i>

661
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:16,805
<i>North Memphis,</i>
<i>throw your thumbs up.</i>

662

<i>Al Kapone.</i>

<i>"Get Crunk, Get Buck." It's hot.</i>

665
00:43:56,470 --> 00:44:00,390
- Do you just do music?
- Hey, man.

666
00:44:02,309 --> 00:44:05,812
Do you got, like, a regular kind of job,
a day job?

667
00:44:06,021 --> 00:44:08,941
Yeah, I got a job.
I restock vending machines.

668
00:44:09,149 --> 00:44:10,359
- Really?
- Yeah, you know,

669
00:44:10,567 --> 00:44:13,737
soda, candy, microwave popcorn.
All that shit.

670
00:44:13,946 --> 00:44:15,781
- That's cool.
- No, it's not cool.

671
00:44:15,989 --> 00:44:17,533
- Why?
- Because

672
00:44:17,741 --> 00:44:20,452
I gotta get up every day
at the crack

673
00:44:20,661 --> 00:44:22,955
and head out to all the truck stops
on the interstate

674
00:44:23,163 --> 00:44:24,748
before I head to the high schools.

675
00:44:24,957 --> 00:44:26,875
Yeah, I'm alone all day,

676
00:44:27,084 --> 00:44:31,713
and I smell like...
Like sticky buns and Skittles.

677
00:44:33,549 --> 00:44:35,884
I thought my job sucked, but...

678
00:44:42,391 --> 00:44:44,309
Hey, man.

679
00:44:44,852 --> 00:44:48,188
So this Skinny Black shit, that's real?

680
00:44:48,897 --> 00:44:51,441
Look, man, because even if he
does listen to what we got, man,

681
00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:53,986
we still don't know what he gonna do,
you know what I mean?

682
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:56,029
It's a one-in-a-million shot, D.

683
00:44:56,238 --> 00:45:00,993
If I can pimp $20 ho's out the back
of this motherfucking Chevy,

684
00:45:01,201 --> 00:45:02,578
I can pimp Skinny.

685
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:05,789
Nigga, you just get me
where I gotta be at.

686
00:45:05,998 --> 00:45:08,083
I'm telling you, this dog got him
some tricks, man.

687
00:45:08,584 --> 00:45:12,504
- You mean "old dog," right?
- I didn't mean it like that, man.

688
00:45:17,676 --> 00:45:20,345
My wife, man, she a...

689
00:45:21,263 --> 00:45:23,182
She a good woman.

690
00:45:25,434 --> 00:45:27,269
She feeds me.

691
00:45:27,603 --> 00:45:30,272
She get freaky on my birthday.

692
00:45:30,772 --> 00:45:33,609
- What she do?
- None of your business.

693
00:45:33,817 --> 00:45:36,737
But sometimes I feel, man, like...

694
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:42,201
Like I talked such a good game
when we was young, man,

695
00:45:42,409 --> 00:45:45,871
about my own studio
and my own label that...

696
00:45:47,414 --> 00:45:50,417
Shit, Djay,
now I'm just paying rent, man.

697
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,508
This shit right here, it gotta work.

698
00:45:59,051 --> 00:46:02,095
It gotta work, man,
because it ain't over for me.

699
00:46:15,651 --> 00:46:20,280
I am so sick and tired of you trying
to tell me what to do with my boy.

700
00:46:20,739 --> 00:46:23,784
That's my son! You go on and
have your little baby, then you can do

701
00:46:23,992 --> 00:46:25,619
- whatever you want!
- Lex, stop yelling.

702
00:46:25,827 --> 00:46:29,665
My pussy paid for this.
I should be mad.

703
00:46:30,791 --> 00:46:34,127
Lookie, lookie, who just decided
to waltz on in.

704
00:46:34,336 --> 00:46:36,713
Where the hell you been at, Djay?

705
00:46:36,922 --> 00:46:39,675
You know, I been standing outside
three hours.

706
00:46:39,883 --> 00:46:42,302
Finally just went on ahead,
took myself a taxi ride.

707
00:46:42,511 --> 00:46:43,720
Spent up all my little monies.

708
00:46:43,929 --> 00:46:47,307
So I really hope you ain't expecting
shit from me today!

709
00:46:50,102 --> 00:46:52,813
- Right back to your toys.
- You should go.

710
00:46:53,021 --> 00:46:55,607
You know what, Djay?

711
00:46:55,816 --> 00:46:59,611
You ain't never gonna be nothing more
than what you is right now,

712
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:02,155
and that's my motherfucking
chauffeur.

713
00:47:03,699 --> 00:47:05,993
I make the money up in here.

714
00:47:06,201 --> 00:47:08,328
Know what? Matter of fact,
I think I feel like

715
00:47:08,537 --> 00:47:10,706
making me some money right now.

716
00:47:10,914 --> 00:47:15,836
Feel like popping my pussy,
maybe shaking my ass.

717
00:47:16,336 --> 00:47:20,382
Go on, boy. Go on, get my car for me.

718
00:47:20,591 --> 00:47:23,760
You heard me. Go on, now, little bitch.

719
00:47:25,429 --> 00:47:27,598
- What the fuck you just say to me?
- That's right, keep...

720
00:47:27,806 --> 00:47:31,435
- What the fuck you call me?
- Called you a motherfucking bitch!

721
00:47:31,643 --> 00:47:35,022
Now, do something about it, damn it!
Do something!

722
00:47:41,486 --> 00:47:43,322
You and me...

723
00:47:44,489 --> 00:47:46,700
...we done, okay?

724
00:47:47,868 --> 00:47:49,620
We done.

725
00:47:50,204 --> 00:47:51,997
You know what?

726
00:47:53,248 --> 00:47:55,959
We been done.

727
00:47:57,711 --> 00:48:01,423
And there you go,
running off to your little toys.

728
00:48:01,632 --> 00:48:04,176
Because you ain't nothing
but a little punk-ass bitch!

729
00:48:04,384 --> 00:48:08,347
- Lex, please back off.
- Just shut the fuck up!

730
00:48:08,555 --> 00:48:12,559
Wasted five years of my damn life
working in this piece-of-shit hole.

731
00:48:12,768 --> 00:48:14,978
So, what now? That's my shit!

732
00:48:15,187 --> 00:48:17,272
What, you just gonna
throw my stuff out?

733
00:48:17,481 --> 00:48:22,569
Oh, out the door! Hey, Djay!
You just leave my shit alone!

734
00:48:22,778 --> 00:48:26,490
I paid for that...
No! No! No!

735
00:48:26,698 --> 00:48:28,867
- I paid for this shit!
- Fuck! Come here.

736
00:48:29,243 --> 00:48:30,827
- Now!
- Djay, no!

737
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:35,916
- Get the fuck off me! Get off me!
- No! No! Djay, no!

738
00:48:36,291 --> 00:48:38,126
Talk now!

739
00:48:39,461 --> 00:48:42,214
- Hey. Hey, come here.
- No, please, D.

740
00:48:42,422 --> 00:48:45,092
Let go. Let go.

741
00:48:46,635 --> 00:48:48,804
Come on. Come on.

742
00:48:54,351 --> 00:48:57,020
Where in the fuck do you
expect me to go?

743
00:48:59,106 --> 00:49:02,401
You can go to hell, all I give a fuck.

744
00:49:20,377 --> 00:49:23,172
Y'all make him pay!

745
00:50:42,042 --> 00:50:44,670
All right, man.
This is what I got so far.

746
00:50:46,588 --> 00:50:49,299
<i>Man, it seems like I'm duckin'</i>
<i>Dodgin' bullets every day</i>

747
00:50:49,508 --> 00:50:52,427
<i>Niggas hatin' on me</i>
<i>'Cause I got ho's on the blade</i>

748
00:50:52,636 --> 00:50:55,389
<i>But I gotta stay paid</i>
<i>Gotta stay above water</i>

749
00:50:55,597 --> 00:50:58,308
<i>Couldn't keep up with my ho's</i>
<i>That's when shit got harder</i>

750
00:50:58,517 --> 00:51:01,353
<i>North Memphis, where I'm from</i>
<i>I'm Seventh Street bound</i>

751
00:51:01,562 --> 00:51:04,356
<i>Where niggas all the time</i>
<i>End up lost and never found</i>

752
00:51:04,565 --> 00:51:07,526
<i>These gals take me through things</i>
<i>Leave a big headache</i>

753
00:51:07,734 --> 00:51:09,862
<i>I'm hopin' every night</i>
<i>They don't end up being dead weight</i>

754
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:14,741
Hold on. Hold on, one second.
My bad.

755
00:51:14,950 --> 00:51:16,618
Baby.

756
00:51:16,827 --> 00:51:19,454
Look, I'm in a session right now,
all right?

757
00:51:19,663 --> 00:51:22,583
<i>- What time you coming home?</i>
- I can't give you that time.

758
00:51:22,791 --> 00:51:24,626
If I give it to you,
you're gonna hold me to that.

759
00:51:24,835 --> 00:51:28,255
<i>- I don't see why you can't give a time.</i>
- Because I'm not gonna do it.

760
00:51:29,298 --> 00:51:31,592
L... Look...

761
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:35,220
If you just let me talk, I can be able
to tell you that I can't do it...

762
00:51:35,429 --> 00:51:38,056
Because I said so, that's why!

763
00:51:40,767 --> 00:51:43,145
You ready to work, lover-boy?

764
00:51:49,109 --> 00:51:52,654
Hey, Shelby,
bring that beat back, man.

765
00:51:52,863 --> 00:51:54,573
From the top.

766
00:51:55,574 --> 00:51:56,867
You know what? Just kill it.

767
00:51:57,075 --> 00:51:59,286
Fuck, man.
I got this flow I need to spit.

768
00:51:59,494 --> 00:52:01,496
Look, look, Djay.

769
00:52:01,788 --> 00:52:03,373
Now, we gonna have to make
a choice, man.

770
00:52:03,582 --> 00:52:06,001
Either we just gonna lay down
some freestyle freefall,

771
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:07,711
or we gonna lay down a track.

772
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:10,005
You know, something that's gonna
get us some radio play.

773
00:52:10,214 --> 00:52:12,257
I thought that's what we was doing
right here.

774
00:52:12,466 --> 00:52:14,843
No, no, no. What we doing
is a whole bunch of flow.

775
00:52:15,052 --> 00:52:18,055
That's all we doing.
And it just go on and on and on.

776
00:52:18,305 --> 00:52:19,431
Man, the shit don't ever stop.

777
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:21,767
Yeah, D, what he's saying is that
we ain't got a hook.

778
00:52:21,975 --> 00:52:24,019
Well, shit, give it some hook, then!

779
00:52:24,228 --> 00:52:25,938
I mean, fuck, you the producer, man.

780
00:52:26,146 --> 00:52:28,732
You just tell me what
you want me to do, then.

781
00:52:28,941 --> 00:52:32,611
We need to lay down something,
Djay. Anything. Even if it's shit.

782
00:52:32,819 --> 00:52:37,491
And I keep telling you, I ain't putting
no shit on top of no shit, man.

783
00:52:37,699 --> 00:52:39,660
I ain't trying to sell no cash shit here.

784
00:52:39,868 --> 00:52:44,623
Well, that's the wonder of audiotape,
Djay. We can just record over shit.

785
00:52:45,832 --> 00:52:47,960
Go on, bring it back up, Shel.

786
00:52:48,502 --> 00:52:51,213
- Go on, bring it up!
- You need some ass, nigga?

787
00:52:51,421 --> 00:52:53,131
- What?
- Because I got a room full of pussy

788
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:55,175
right in there for you.

789
00:52:57,261 --> 00:52:58,470
- Fuck you, Djay.
- Oh, fuck me?

790
00:52:58,679 --> 00:53:00,973
- Yeah, fuck you.
- No, no, fuck Yevette, man.

791
00:53:01,181 --> 00:53:03,976
Because she the one got your ass
wound up like a motherfucking clock.

792
00:53:04,184 --> 00:53:05,394
Look here, you dirt-rascal pimp,

793
00:53:05,602 --> 00:53:07,479
you keep my wife's name out
your mouth, you hear me?

794
00:53:07,688 --> 00:53:10,482
- Hey, guys, come on, keep it light.
- Sound like your wife,

795
00:53:10,691 --> 00:53:13,026
she the one need to put something
in her motherfucking mouth.

796
00:53:13,235 --> 00:53:14,987
- You know what I'm saying?
- Fuck you say, man?

797
00:53:15,195 --> 00:53:17,364
- You heard me, nigga!
- What the fuck you say, man?

798
00:53:17,573 --> 00:53:19,491
- That's what!
- Stop it, man! Sit down!

799
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:21,243
- What?! What?!
- What's up, man?!

800
00:53:21,451 --> 00:53:23,579
Can you please stop it?
Do we have to do this?

801
00:53:23,787 --> 00:53:27,332
Can't we just smoke a joint,
for chrissake?!

802
00:53:27,541 --> 00:53:30,711
- Who is it?
- It's me, Shug.

803
00:53:30,919 --> 00:53:35,215
- Look, bitch, we working right now!
- I got something for you.

804
00:53:42,222 --> 00:53:44,391
Come on, man.

805
00:53:45,017 --> 00:53:47,227
Sorry to interrupt y'all's
recording session,

806
00:53:47,436 --> 00:53:50,272
but they had this interview
with Skinny Black on TV

807
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:56,236
and look like he had one of these
in his studio where he uses,

808
00:53:56,445 --> 00:53:59,781
so I thought I'd go out
and buy you one.

809
00:54:00,282 --> 00:54:02,451
Y'all have fun.

810
00:54:21,595 --> 00:54:24,473
That's a bottom bitch for you.

811
00:54:25,390 --> 00:54:28,185
I mean, we got everything we need
right here.

812
00:54:28,393 --> 00:54:30,687
And all this stuff in this...

813
00:54:31,230 --> 00:54:35,192
This little-bitty space, man,
it just looks so much bigger now.

814
00:54:44,743 --> 00:54:47,329
I'm here trying to squeeze a dollar
out of a dime,

815
00:54:47,538 --> 00:54:50,249
and I ain't even got a cent, man.

816
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:54,086
It takes time, Djay.

817
00:55:05,305 --> 00:55:07,599
Do y'all believe in omens?

818
00:55:11,854 --> 00:55:15,065
Okay, Shug, put your headphones on.

819
00:55:15,482 --> 00:55:17,609
- Move closer to the mike.
- Okay.

820
00:55:17,818 --> 00:55:19,194
Can you hear yourself?

821
00:55:20,112 --> 00:55:23,574
- Say something.
- Hello. Oh, yeah.

822
00:55:24,867 --> 00:55:26,118
Okay, Shug,

823
00:55:26,326 --> 00:55:28,745
what we need right now
is called a "hook."

824
00:55:28,954 --> 00:55:30,956
That's like the chorus of the song.

825
00:55:31,164 --> 00:55:35,002
Now, you're gonna be singing
what's on Djay's pad. Djay.

826
00:55:40,966 --> 00:55:42,384
All right, now.

827
00:55:42,551 --> 00:55:44,803
"You know it's hard out here
for a pimp

831
00:55:52,227 --> 00:55:54,646
"Jumping ship." Okay.

832
00:55:55,230 --> 00:55:59,026
Now, Shug, I got an idea
how this should go.

833
00:55:59,234 --> 00:56:00,986
Now, I suck,

834
00:56:01,195 --> 00:56:03,697
but, I'm gonna sing it with you
until you get it down, all right?

835
00:56:03,906 --> 00:56:05,240
Okay.

Hey, D, I wanna do one.
I wanna put one down.

No. Hush up, Nola.

Hey, Shelby, close the door.
We need to work.

We about to lay you down now, man.

00:59:46,962 --> 00:59:49,965
Shelby, you hear that?

894
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:52,593
Yeah. What is that?

895
00:59:55,804 --> 00:59:58,140
- One of y'all leave the TV on?
- No.

896
01:00:02,728 --> 01:00:04,521
Goddamn.

897
01:00:06,190 --> 01:00:09,484
This day is really starting to fuck
with my mode, man.

898
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:13,488
Hey, man, R.L. Over here?

899
01:00:25,959 --> 01:00:28,712
R.L., look, man, I'm sorry
to disturb you and all.

900
01:00:29,296 --> 01:00:31,298
And I know you and me,

901
01:00:31,507 --> 01:00:34,843
we done had words in the past and
some of them weren't too friendly.

902
01:00:35,052 --> 01:00:37,429
But right now, man, I got some shit
taking place in my crib

903
01:00:37,638 --> 01:00:41,308
that just requires a little bit of
silence. You know what I mean?

904
01:00:41,517 --> 01:00:46,146
Now, I'd never demand of you,
I can only request...

905
01:00:49,066 --> 01:00:52,444
...with a gesture of neighborly
friendliness, you know what I mean,

906
01:00:52,653 --> 01:00:57,908
that you please, please consider
the mute button just for a spell, man.

907
01:01:01,995 --> 01:01:03,580
All right, man.

908
01:01:08,377 --> 01:01:10,712
- Stand by, everybody.
- Standing by.

909
01:01:12,673 --> 01:01:14,383
I'm standing by.

910
01:01:28,355 --> 01:01:31,233
<i>You know it's hard out here</i>

<i>Done seen people killed</i>
<i>Done seen people deal</i>

923
01:02:07,352 --> 01:02:10,063
<i>Done seen people live in poverty</i>
<i>With no meals</i>

924
01:02:10,272 --> 01:02:13,108
<i>It's fucked up where I live</i>
<i>But this is how it is</i>

925
01:02:13,317 --> 01:02:16,236
<i>It might be new to you</i>
<i>But it's been like this for years</i>

926
01:02:16,445 --> 01:02:19,072
<i>It's blood, sweat and tears</i>
<i>When it come down to this shit</i>

01:02:19,281 --> 01:02:22,201
<i>I'm trying to get rich 'fore</i>
<i>I leave up out this bitch</i>

928
01:02:22,409 --> 01:02:24,995
<i>I'm trying to have things</i>
<i>But it's hard for a pimp</i>

957
01:03:22,010 --> 01:03:24,805
<i>That's the way the game goes</i>

<i>Will have a whole lot of bitches</i>
<i>Jumpin' ship</i>

974
01:03:51,623 --> 01:03:54,126
- Cut it. Cut it.
- What?

975
01:03:54,334 --> 01:03:56,712
Wait, man.
I got another verse, man!

976
01:04:00,048 --> 01:04:02,134
Djay, we need to talk, man.

977
01:04:02,885 --> 01:04:05,012
<i>Look, I just want it to be perfect.</i>
<i>And this mike,</i>

978
01:04:05,721 --> 01:04:07,598
it ain't shit.

979
01:04:07,806 --> 01:04:10,142
What the fuck wrong with it?
That shit record, don't it?

980
01:04:10,350 --> 01:04:15,939
Djay, the mikes we using, they got
a wider pattern, D. They go flat.

981
01:04:16,148 --> 01:04:19,401
So when you start screaming,
man, they just distort and pop out.

982
01:04:19,610 --> 01:04:21,945
Man, nigga, I don't know shit
about none of that shit!

983
01:04:22,154 --> 01:04:24,156
All I know is that shit
in there was live, man!

984
01:04:24,364 --> 01:04:26,200
And every time I get
my motherfucking mode up,

985
01:04:26,408 --> 01:04:27,993
- you come and fuck with it!
- It ain't me.

986
01:04:28,202 --> 01:04:30,120
That shit, it ain't gonna
be live like that again.

987
01:04:30,329 --> 01:04:31,747
I don't give a fuck what mike I'm on!

988
01:04:31,955 --> 01:04:36,001
Djay, that shit was live in there,

989
01:04:36,251 --> 01:04:38,879
but it was also distorted, man.

990
01:04:40,047 --> 01:04:41,548
God!

991
01:04:42,758 --> 01:04:45,219
I just don't understand why
I gotta pay so much more money

992
01:04:45,427 --> 01:04:46,970
for that microphone right there

993
01:04:47,179 --> 01:04:52,434
when the one right next to it
look just like it but cost half, man.

994
01:04:52,643 --> 01:04:53,894
Let's do it this way, man.

995
01:04:54,102 --> 01:04:57,648
If I buy two of them, say you give
them to me both for $90.

996
01:04:57,856 --> 01:05:01,610
This is studio quality. It costs $250.

997
01:05:01,818 --> 01:05:04,321
Now, why would I sell you
two of them for $90 apiece?

998
01:05:04,530 --> 01:05:05,948
Just because of that statement, man,

999
01:05:06,156 --> 01:05:08,200
"The customer's always right,"
ain't you heard?

1000
01:05:08,408 --> 01:05:10,577
Not in this case, sir, no.

1001
01:05:10,786 --> 01:05:13,539
If you want quality,
you have to pay for it.

1002
01:05:13,747 --> 01:05:18,085
Look, man, can't you cut me some
type of break on this stuff here?

1003
01:05:23,006 --> 01:05:24,132
What was that?

1004
01:05:25,467 --> 01:05:29,721
- What?
- I mean, what you looking at, man?

1005
01:05:30,305 --> 01:05:32,766
- Nothing.
- Don't worry, Sparky, man.

1006
01:05:32,975 --> 01:05:35,602
I ain't gonna pop or nothing like that.

1007
01:05:37,980 --> 01:05:39,982
Look here, man.

1008
01:05:40,190 --> 01:05:43,986
The thing is, that gal over there, right?

1009
01:05:44,194 --> 01:05:46,530
I got it in real good with her.

1010
01:05:46,738 --> 01:05:48,907
I mean, she's my gal and all,

1011
01:05:49,116 --> 01:05:53,203
but she don't necessarily
belong to me.

1012
01:05:55,038 --> 01:05:56,415
You see, a gal like that, man,

1013
01:05:56,623 --> 01:06:01,128
she the type of girl that wanna
shut them doors, lock them,

1014
01:06:01,336 --> 01:06:05,048
see what type of specials
you got going on in the back.

1015
01:06:05,883 --> 01:06:09,261
And me, I'm the kind of man that

1016
01:06:09,469 --> 01:06:11,805
just walk out of here and
leave a girl like that behind

1017
01:06:12,014 --> 01:06:17,227
because, like I say, she with me
and all, but she don't belong to me.

1018
01:06:17,436 --> 01:06:19,396
Not necessarily.

1019
01:06:19,897 --> 01:06:22,441
And maybe when she leaves...

1020
01:06:23,025 --> 01:06:26,945
...she can take something that don't
necessarily belong to her neither.

1021
01:06:27,529 --> 01:06:31,867
It's like you say, man, you want
quality, you got to pay for that.

1022
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:43,128
Hey, gal.

1023
01:06:44,963 --> 01:06:47,174
I need that microphone.

1024
01:06:47,883 --> 01:06:48,884
Okay.

1025
01:06:49,051 --> 01:06:51,220
I need you to go back there
and be friendly with him

1026
01:06:51,428 --> 01:06:54,097
and bring that microphone
out with you, okay?

1027
01:06:55,057 --> 01:06:57,267
No. No way.

1028
01:06:57,476 --> 01:07:00,854
Nola, I need that microphone.

1029
01:07:01,063 --> 01:07:02,689
Get it.

1030
01:07:02,898 --> 01:07:05,108
Y'all be good, now.

1031
01:07:30,050 --> 01:07:31,510
Hey.

1032
01:07:41,019 --> 01:07:41,979
Hey.

1033
01:07:42,187 --> 01:07:45,065
- Don't ever do that to me again, D.
- What? I ain't...

1034
01:07:45,274 --> 01:07:48,569
No, I ain't some fucking cash machine,
where you can get shit for free.

1035
01:07:48,777 --> 01:07:50,404
Ain't like you was
in there sweating bullets.

1036
01:07:50,612 --> 01:07:53,115
- I gotta have a say in what I do!
- You was in there for a minute.

1037
01:07:53,323 --> 01:07:56,326
- I gotta have a say in what I do!
- Look, man, I was gonna give...

1038

I'm not gonna suck dick
every time you come up short!

1039
01:07:58,704 --> 01:07:59,705
You got something for me.

1040
01:07:59,955 --> 01:08:02,082

1042
01:08:05,586 --> 01:08:08,589
This is expensive motherfucking...

1044
01:08:13,635 --> 01:08:16,305
Nola! Bring your ass here, man!

1045
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:18,974
Don't you ever walk away from me!

1046
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:22,728
We do what the fuck
we gotta do, man! By any means!

1047
01:08:22,936 --> 01:08:26,481
Ain't that right?
We take care of our shit.

1048
01:08:26,690 --> 01:08:28,192
You think I like this shit?

1049
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:30,110
You think I wanna
spend the rest of my life

1050
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:32,321
pimping your pimpled country ass?

1051
01:08:32,529 --> 01:08:35,782
Well, not me! I fucking hate you.

1052
01:08:36,074 --> 01:08:38,118
I hate this shit!

1053
01:08:38,744 --> 01:08:40,120
D!

1054
01:08:43,165 --> 01:08:46,585
Do you know what I do
in the back of them cars?

1055
01:08:47,669 --> 01:08:49,546
Do you?

1056
01:08:49,755 --> 01:08:51,340
Everybody's got something to do!

1057
01:08:51,548 --> 01:08:56,720
Everybody's got something important
going on in their life but me, D!

1058
01:08:56,929 --> 01:08:58,847
And I want something!

1059
01:08:59,056 --> 01:09:01,683
- What do you want?
- I don't really know, but I want some...

1060
01:09:01,892 --> 01:09:03,977
- What do you want?
- I don't know.

1061
01:09:04,186 --> 01:09:08,232
- Tell me what the fuck you wanna do!
- Not this, D!

1062
01:09:18,575 --> 01:09:22,454
You know what, man?

1063
01:09:22,663 --> 01:09:25,249
You know, bitch like you, man,

1064
01:09:25,457 --> 01:09:26,667

1065
01:09:26,875 --> 01:09:29,378
Get you a mobile phone and shit.
Get an ear jack.

1066
01:09:29,586 --> 01:09:30,754
Man, you gonna feel different.

1067
01:09:30,963 --> 01:09:33,173
I'm gonna put you in some
new shoes tomorrow, man.

1068
01:09:33,382 --> 01:09:34,424
And you gonna feel

1069
01:09:34,633 --> 01:09:37,427
- like you are in charge.
- D!

1070
01:09:40,222 --> 01:09:42,891
I know when you're messing
with my head.

1071
01:09:43,267 --> 01:09:45,060
Because I let you.

1072
01:09:46,228 --> 01:09:49,565
Because sometimes my head
needs to be messed with.

1073
01:09:51,817 --> 01:09:55,863
But right now, just don't.

1074
01:09:56,655 --> 01:09:58,156
Okay?

1075
01:10:04,288 --> 01:10:06,039
Okay.

1076
01:10:21,597 --> 01:10:23,098
Hey, Shelby,
I need some high-hat, man.

1077
01:10:23,307 --> 01:10:25,184
Give me some high-hat
up top, all right?

1078
01:10:25,392 --> 01:10:27,102
Okay, man. This takes a little time.

1079
01:10:30,272 --> 01:10:33,066
Look, it should come in right
after the kick. Right there.

1080
01:10:36,612 --> 01:10:37,571
Yeah, that's it.

1081
01:10:40,199 --> 01:10:43,243
- Try that bit.
<i>- Keep hustlin'</i>

1082
01:10:45,287 --> 01:10:48,415
<i>- Keep flowin'</i>
- How that sound?

1083
01:10:48,624 --> 01:10:50,501
Tell her to put some more dick in it!

1084
01:10:50,709 --> 01:10:53,545
- Most gracious and heavenly Father,
- Okay.

1085
01:10:53,754 --> 01:10:56,924
We ask that you bless this food...

1086
01:10:59,218 --> 01:11:01,303
...and our home.

1087
01:11:18,111 --> 01:11:19,947
- Hi.
- Hey.

1088
01:11:20,155 --> 01:11:21,615
My name is Yevette.

1089
01:11:21,823 --> 01:11:25,410
I'm Clyde's... I mean, Key's wife.

1090
01:11:25,619 --> 01:11:27,579
Oh, yeah. He in the back
with the rest of the fellas.

1091
01:11:27,829 --> 01:11:29,790
They fitting to cut something.

1092
01:11:30,165 --> 01:11:31,166
Cut?

1093
01:11:31,333 --> 01:11:34,545
Well, I like that first one, but you don't.

1094
01:11:34,753 --> 01:11:37,965
Well, I think you should
throw out your best ball.

1095
01:11:38,173 --> 01:11:41,176
And to me, that's the second one.

1096
01:11:41,385 --> 01:11:44,429
Okay. We gonna gab, or we gonna
do the damn thing? Which one?

1097
01:11:44,638 --> 01:11:48,600
- Hey, let's beat that bitch, then, man.
- Hey, everybody.

1098
01:11:51,019 --> 01:11:53,522
This here's Yevette, Key's wife.

1099
01:11:54,523 --> 01:11:57,442
And look, she brought
everybody sandwiches.

1100
01:11:59,736 --> 01:12:02,030
Yeah, yeah. There's...

1101
01:12:02,239 --> 01:12:05,325
There's some dill sauce there
in the middle if y'all wanna dip.

1102
01:12:05,534 --> 01:12:06,952
If you want.

1103
01:12:08,537 --> 01:12:10,831
Hey, you know...

1104
01:12:12,624 --> 01:12:14,626
...Key worked really hard
on this last one there,

1105
01:12:14,877 --> 01:12:19,006
so you might wanna
just take a little listen to it.

1106
01:12:20,424 --> 01:12:23,260
Oh, no. I don't wanna interrupt. I...

1107
01:12:23,468 --> 01:12:28,974
- It's just dinnertime. I thought y'all...
- But I think we'd like for you to stay.

1108
01:12:29,224 --> 01:12:30,809
Right, Key?

1109
01:12:38,692 --> 01:12:40,235
Yeah.

1110
01:12:43,572 --> 01:12:44,990
Okay.

1111
01:12:47,910 --> 01:12:50,704
Look, this track here, man, this...

1112
01:12:50,913 --> 01:12:53,832
This is my heart, man, so...

1113
01:12:54,583 --> 01:12:56,043
Before I do my thing,

1114
01:12:56,251 --> 01:12:58,462
put my mouth to this mike,

1115
01:12:58,670 --> 01:13:03,133
I wanna bless it with a kiss
from my primary investor, all right?

1116
01:13:05,469 --> 01:13:07,179
Come on, baby.

1117
01:13:14,019 --> 01:13:15,729
Go on, girl.

1118
01:13:23,487 --> 01:13:27,533
Hey, just like our primary investor,
that mike is hot.

1119
01:13:28,367 --> 01:13:30,202
So kill them fans.

1120
01:13:56,478 --> 01:13:57,604
<i>Look, this is my life</i>

1121
01:13:57,813 --> 01:14:00,566
<i>And it's a battle within</i>
<i>I gotta survive</i>

1122
01:14:00,774 --> 01:14:02,192
<i>Even if I'm sinnin' to win</i>

1123
01:14:02,401 --> 01:14:05,279
<i>And if I show no remorse</i>
<i>I'll reap the devil's reward</i>

1124
01:14:05,487 --> 01:14:08,115
<i>He said he'd give me riches</i>
<i>But I'm lookin' for more</i>

1125
01:14:08,323 --> 01:14:11,326
<i>When I was young</i>
<i>Witnessed my dad standin' for right</i>

1126
01:14:11,535 --> 01:14:14,079
<i>Black pride in him</i>
<i>Even though he passin' for white</i>

1127
01:14:14,288 --> 01:14:16,957
<i>Took years from my life</i>
<i>Now I'm missin' the man</i>

1128
01:14:17,165 --> 01:14:20,002
<i>Mom's on some other shit</i>
<i>And now I'm missin' the plan</i>

1129
01:14:20,210 --> 01:14:23,005
<i>So I'm stuck</i>
<i>In this fuck-the-world mold</i>

1130
01:14:23,213 --> 01:14:25,799
<i>All the lessons</i>
<i>To a young teen nigga was cold</i>

1131
01:14:26,008 --> 01:14:28,760
<i>Then my pimpin' ass uncle</i>
<i>Put me up on the game</i>

1132
01:14:28,969 --> 01:14:31,680
<i>It really ain't no love</i>
<i>It's 'bout this paper, man</i>

1133
01:14:31,889 --> 01:14:34,600
<i>Put me in a position</i>
<i>Got me out on a mission</i>

1134
01:14:34,808 --> 01:14:37,477
<i>Collectin' from the ho's</i>
<i>Turned me on about pimpin'</i>

1135
01:14:37,686 --> 01:14:40,314
<i>A nigga from Memphis</i>
<i>Dealin' with life as a struggle</i>

1136
01:14:40,522 --> 01:14:43,317
<i>This is the gift I was given</i>
<i>So I just live by my hustle</i>

1137
01:14:43,775 --> 01:14:45,903
<i>Keep hustlin'</i>

1138
01:14:46,403 --> 01:14:48,989
<i>It ain't over for me</i>
<i>No, it ain't over for me</i>

1139
01:14:49,364 --> 01:14:52,367
<i>Keep flowin'</i>
<i>Flowin'</i>

1140
01:14:52,659 --> 01:14:54,912
<i>I'ma step my game up</i>
<i>And get what's coming to me</i>

1141
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:57,664
<i>Keep hustlin'</i>

1142
01:14:58,290 --> 01:15:00,834
<i>It ain't over for me</i>
<i>No, it ain't over for me</i>

1143
01:15:01,043 --> 01:15:03,754
<i>Keep flowin'</i>
<i>Keep on flowin'</i>

1144
01:15:03,962 --> 01:15:06,882
<i>I'ma step my game up</i>
<i>And get what's coming to me</i>

1145
01:15:07,090 --> 01:15:09,218
We got to get this shit done
by the Fourth of July, man,

1146
01:15:09,426 --> 01:15:12,262
because I got some people
I gotta slip this to.

1147
01:15:12,513 --> 01:15:15,224
- Who do you know?
- You remember Skinny Black.

1148
01:15:15,432 --> 01:15:18,644
<i>I think I see a hater right there.</i>
<i>Hold up.</i>

- "Skinny Black" Skinny Black?
- Yeah, I know who Skinny Black is.

1151
01:15:24,691 --> 01:15:27,194
I've got all of his early stuff,
back when he was still good.

1152
01:15:27,402 --> 01:15:29,321
Now, do you really know him,
or just know of him?

1153
01:15:29,530 --> 01:15:32,616
I mean, he may not know me, because
we went to different schools and all.

1154
01:15:32,824 --> 01:15:36,119
We went to different schools and all,
but, yeah, I know Skinny.

1155
01:15:36,328 --> 01:15:38,247
<i>But I'm here to let you know</i>

You wanna make a dollar? Best get

1159
01:15:44,878 --> 01:15:48,131
Me and him gonna be kicking it over

1160
01:15:48,340 --> 01:15:52,261
If I can pimp $20 ho's out the back
of this fucked-up Chevy,

1161
01:15:52,761 --> 01:15:53,762
I can pimp Skinny.

1162
01:15:53,971 --> 01:15:56,223
<i>Now I'm just gettin' by</i>
<i>And it's fuckin' with me</i>

<i>I let some others get a dose</i>
<i>And they was nuttin' to this</i>

1168
01:16:11,488 --> 01:16:14,116
<i>Let me check my connections</i>

<i>The new millennium, man</i>

1173
01:16:26,086 --> 01:16:28,755

<i>Keep on hustlin'</i>

1183
01:16:55,324 --> 01:16:58,035

01:16:58,243 --> 01:17:00,787

1186
01:17:53,006 --> 01:17:54,675
Thank you.

1187
01:18:01,890 --> 01:18:04,351
Ain't you gonna be hot in your coat?

1188
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:06,520
No, this is good leather, man.

1189
01:18:06,728 --> 01:18:08,856
The kind that keep you
at the temperature you wanna be at,

1190
01:18:09,064 --> 01:18:10,566
know what I mean?

1191
01:18:13,068 --> 01:18:15,404
See this thing right here?

1192
01:18:19,157 --> 01:18:21,618
This was my daddy's watch.

1193
01:18:23,245 --> 01:18:26,331
He used to work
for the school district and all...

1194
01:18:26,790 --> 01:18:29,793
...fixing them buses all over town.

1195
01:18:33,630 --> 01:18:34,965
Yeah.

1196
01:18:35,174 --> 01:18:38,093
Every now and then, when I see
them buses go by today,

1197
01:18:38,302 --> 01:18:39,928
I get all excited
because I say,

1198
01:18:40,137 --> 01:18:43,223
"My daddy used to work
on that," you know?

1199
01:18:43,515 --> 01:18:47,352
But, you know, after he'd been
there maybe about ten years or so,

1200
01:18:47,561 --> 01:18:49,646
gave him this and...

1201
01:18:50,272 --> 01:18:52,691
Kind of thought about burying
him with it, but then again I said,

1202
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:56,445
"Maybe not, maybe I should keep it
as an heirloom," know what I mean?

1203
01:19:10,626 --> 01:19:13,712
- I got you something.
- What?

1204
01:19:15,339 --> 01:19:18,759
Well, it's like, you know, I been
watching them videos and all.

1205
01:19:18,967 --> 01:19:23,722
And it be like all them rappers,
they got some chain.

1206
01:19:24,389 --> 01:19:25,849
So...

1207
01:19:32,022 --> 01:19:33,232
Oh, shit.

1208
01:19:34,566 --> 01:19:35,817
Yeah.

1209
01:19:36,026 --> 01:19:38,695
You always talking about your name
being right and everything,

1210
01:19:38,904 --> 01:19:43,116
so I thought people
could see how you like it spelled out.

1211
01:19:43,325 --> 01:19:45,619
You know, with the J-A-Y.

1212
01:19:48,455 --> 01:19:49,915
Damn.

1213
01:19:51,875 --> 01:19:55,587
- This shit is perfect, man.
- Let me put it on.

1214
01:19:59,675 --> 01:20:02,386
- I wanna see it.
- Okay.

1215
01:20:07,099 --> 01:20:09,101
- D.
- What?

1216
01:20:11,728 --> 01:20:14,064
I can't believe...
I get like this

1217
01:20:14,273 --> 01:20:17,234
because I'm pregnant and everything...

1218
01:20:17,442 --> 01:20:19,820
...but, you know,
letting me sing on the...

1219
01:20:20,028 --> 01:20:23,156
On the demo and everything
like you do...

1220
01:20:23,866 --> 01:20:27,786
...well, it just...
It made me feel real...

1221
01:20:28,203 --> 01:20:30,247
Real special.

1222
01:20:30,873 --> 01:20:32,457
And...

1223
01:20:32,666 --> 01:20:36,253
I mean, I know y'all gonna
be moving on and moving up...

1224
01:20:37,254 --> 01:20:39,548
...and y'all are gonna get
real good people to sing,

1225
01:20:39,756 --> 01:20:42,968
you know, backup for you
and everything...

1226
01:20:44,261 --> 01:20:45,971
...but I just...

1227
01:20:47,055 --> 01:20:50,475
D, I need you to know
it meant the world to me.

1228
01:20:52,728 --> 01:20:54,146
Come here.

1229
01:20:59,067 --> 01:21:01,612
Thank you so much, D.

1230
01:21:11,246 --> 01:21:13,790
Djay, come on, man,
you gotta be there at 9:00, right?

1231
01:21:13,999 --> 01:21:17,711
Calm your ass down, man.
He gonna be there all night.

1232
01:21:22,090 --> 01:21:23,884
I ain't scared.

1233
01:21:27,471 --> 01:21:29,223
I know.

1234
01:21:44,655 --> 01:21:46,949
- Come on, man.
- Wow, check it out.

1235
01:21:47,574 --> 01:21:51,286
Okay, look here. Djay, I put some
extra demos in the car, all right, man?

1236
01:21:51,495 --> 01:21:52,913
In case they have
some label folk there.

1237
01:21:53,121 --> 01:21:56,208
Hey, if they want CDs, they just
gonna have to hit us back on that.

1238
01:21:56,416 --> 01:21:59,419
Man, I like that.
I need to get one of those.

1239
01:21:59,628 --> 01:22:01,088
D.

1240
01:22:02,256 --> 01:22:06,051
- You all right, man?
- You got your mode on, D?

1241
01:22:08,095 --> 01:22:10,138
Hold up for a second.

1242
01:23:38,143 --> 01:23:40,521
Came to party tonight.

1243
01:23:40,896 --> 01:23:44,024
What's happening with you, man?
Where your boy at?

1244
01:23:44,233 --> 01:23:46,276
Over at the big table.

1245
01:23:47,569 --> 01:23:51,865
- I don't see him, man.
- I'll take you over. You ready?

1246
01:23:53,116 --> 01:23:56,078
Hey, let's get a drink first, man.

1247
01:23:56,370 --> 01:23:58,497
All right, what the hell.

1248
01:23:58,705 --> 01:24:03,001
- Hey, I see you packing tonight, huh?
- Do a bear shit in the woods?

1249
01:24:03,544 --> 01:24:07,130
Hey, who the fuck is that?
Hey, who the fuck is that, man?

1250
01:24:07,339 --> 01:24:11,927
Oh, man, I can't believe what my
goddamn eyes are seeing right now!

1251
01:24:12,135 --> 01:24:13,637
I'm gonna have
to get a Seeing Eye nigga

1252
01:24:13,846 --> 01:24:16,598
just to tell me what the fuck
I'm looking at, man!

1253
01:24:16,807 --> 01:24:18,934
Is it? Could it be?

1254
01:24:19,142 --> 01:24:20,811
The one, the goddamn only...

1255
01:24:21,019 --> 01:24:22,688
Skinny!

1256
01:24:23,063 --> 01:24:24,398
- Is that you?
- Slobs!

1257
01:24:24,606 --> 01:24:26,733
- Boy, you fat, black and nasty,
- My nigga.

1258
01:24:26,942 --> 01:24:29,319
- Greasy ham-hock, chicken-eating,
- You Ethiopian poster boy.

1259
01:24:29,528 --> 01:24:31,780
- Can't-see-your-own-dick,
- Middle Eastern stepchild.

1260
01:24:31,989 --> 01:24:35,409
Ass-crack-longer-than-the-
M-I-S-S-I-S-S-I-P-P-I,

1261
01:24:35,617 --> 01:24:37,411
fat, black, nasty bastard!

1262
01:24:37,619 --> 01:24:40,205
- What's going on?
- Come here, nigga!

1263
01:24:40,414 --> 01:24:41,999
- How's my nigga?
- Back in the day, nigga.

1264
01:24:42,207 --> 01:24:43,709
- Yeah, that was it.
- Back in the day.

1265
01:24:43,917 --> 01:24:45,210
Back in the motherfucking day.

1266
01:24:45,419 --> 01:24:47,754
Bring your ass over here, man.
Let me get you a drink.

1267
01:24:47,963 --> 01:24:49,798
A drink in your hand
and some pussy in your lap.

1268
01:24:50,007 --> 01:24:51,884
Hey, I need that!

1269
01:24:54,595 --> 01:24:56,555
You ready to go over?

1270
01:24:57,389 --> 01:24:59,600
Hold... Hold up, man.

1271
01:25:04,563 --> 01:25:06,064
Hey, man.

1272
01:25:18,827 --> 01:25:21,330
Skinny, I think
you know my man Djay.

1273
01:25:22,664 --> 01:25:25,792
- Man, I don't know this nigga, man.
- Hey, baby, it's been a long time.

1274
01:25:26,001 --> 01:25:28,003
No, it's cool, man. It's nice
to see you home again.

1275
01:25:28,212 --> 01:25:30,255
Got all these folks telling me
I been gone too long.

1276
01:25:30,464 --> 01:25:34,551
Like I'm coming back or something.
Like there's a back to get back to.

1277
01:25:34,760 --> 01:25:37,513
I say, fuck!
Best place to keep Memphis

1278
01:25:37,721 --> 01:25:40,140
is in my rear-view,
you know what I'm saying?

1279
01:25:40,349 --> 01:25:42,184
You know what I'm saying,
whoever the fuck you is?

1280
01:25:42,392 --> 01:25:43,435
You know what I'm saying?

1281
01:25:43,644 --> 01:25:45,604
Hey, man, what's up
with your boy, man?

1282
01:25:45,812 --> 01:25:47,481
- Skinny.
- I don't need this shit.

1283
01:25:47,689 --> 01:25:50,359
This is the man
I was telling you about.

1284
01:25:53,487 --> 01:25:56,323
- Oh, this here the man?
- This here Djay.

1285
01:25:56,532 --> 01:25:59,701
- You and me, we went to different...
- Djay like short-for-something DJ,

1286
01:25:59,910 --> 01:26:02,913
or you mean like... that type of DJ?

1287
01:26:04,581 --> 01:26:08,794
- No, man. It's just... It's just Djay.
- Man, every time I come to Memphis,

1288
01:26:09,002 --> 01:26:12,256
my folks hooking me up with this
old dirt-ass weed out here, man.

1289
01:26:12,464 --> 01:26:14,675
Like they grow it out the ass
of some redneck or something.

1290
01:26:14,883 --> 01:26:17,719
But my boy Arnel here
say you slinging that killer.

1291
01:26:17,928 --> 01:26:19,346
Is that real, or what?

1292
01:26:21,431 --> 01:26:23,225
Baby, you be the judge for that.

1293
01:26:25,561 --> 01:26:26,979
How much I owe you for this, man?

1294
01:26:27,187 --> 01:26:29,189
Here now, seeing how friendly
you are to me

1295
01:26:29,398 --> 01:26:31,942
and the fact we go back in the day,

1296
01:26:32,150 --> 01:26:33,819
it's on me, okay?

1297
01:26:34,278 --> 01:26:36,488
Well, go on ahead and have a seat,
my blood brother.

1298
01:26:37,865 --> 01:26:41,869
Hell, yeah. Check this out here.
Smell that. Damn, boy.

1299
01:26:42,077 --> 01:26:44,872
Boy, he wasn't playing around
with this here! I think I'm in love.

1300
01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:46,540
You remember way back in the day

1301
01:26:46,748 --> 01:26:49,793
when you used to be hustling
your tapes over at the drive-in, man?

1302
01:26:50,002 --> 01:26:53,172
- What?
- Look at that ass, boy!

1303
01:26:53,380 --> 01:26:57,593
God bless America in this
motherfucker! What's going on, baby?

1304
01:26:57,801 --> 01:27:01,138
It's Independence Day!
It is Independence Day, right?

1305
01:27:01,346 --> 01:27:02,890
You know, I got that up from...

1306
01:27:03,098 --> 01:27:06,351
There's this little dude brought that
up from New Orleans, man.

1307
01:27:07,311 --> 01:27:08,979
Me first! Me first!

1308
01:27:53,398 --> 01:27:55,400
Hey, Skinny!

1309
01:27:58,153 --> 01:28:00,531
What the fuck
happened to you, man?

1310
01:28:03,283 --> 01:28:05,786
What the fuck
happened to you, man?

1311
01:28:05,994 --> 01:28:08,080
What the fuck did you just say?

1312
01:28:11,250 --> 01:28:14,086
I don't mean no disrespect and all.

1313
01:28:14,378 --> 01:28:18,298
I just remember when your first
underground crunk

1314
01:28:18,507 --> 01:28:20,634
hit the motherfucking streets, man,

1315
01:28:20,843 --> 01:28:23,929
that shit flew through Memphis
like a motherfucking typhoon.

1316
01:28:24,137 --> 01:28:25,514
Y'all was there, man.

1317
01:28:25,722 --> 01:28:28,976
Nigga couldn't even walk halfway
down the block without the pavement

1318
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:31,979
crumbling underneath his feet
because some cat was bumping

1319
01:28:32,187 --> 01:28:35,148
your shit
out the back of his Caddy, man.

1320
01:28:35,607 --> 01:28:37,276
We just miss you, Skinny, that's all.

1321
01:28:37,484 --> 01:28:40,571
Miss me? Get up, bitch.
Hold up. Hold up. Hold up.

1322
01:28:40,779 --> 01:28:44,157
- Miss me? Nigga, I don't even...
- Fuck this nigga, man.

1323
01:28:44,366 --> 01:28:45,701
So wait, wait, wait, wait.

1324
01:28:45,909 --> 01:28:47,870
You trying to say
I can't cut it no more?

1325
01:28:48,078 --> 01:28:50,539
Like I ain't the shit?
That's what you trying to tell me?

1326
01:28:50,747 --> 01:28:53,959
- I ain't saying nothing like that.
- Then what the fuck is you saying?

1327
01:28:54,168 --> 01:28:55,961
What is you saying, then?

1328
01:29:01,175 --> 01:29:03,385
Dig this right here, man.

1329
01:29:04,303 --> 01:29:07,431
One day, this whole motherfucking
place is gonna be gone.

1330
01:29:07,639 --> 01:29:10,893
This club, this city, man.

1331
01:29:11,101 --> 01:29:13,812
This whole U.S. Of A., man,
is just gonna turn to dust, right?

1332
01:29:14,313 --> 01:29:17,274
And a whole new civilization
is gonna rise from this one.

1333
01:29:17,482 --> 01:29:18,942
And they gonna start digging,
you know.

1334
01:29:19,151 --> 01:29:21,195
They gonna dig up
the pyramids over in Egypt.

1335
01:29:21,403 --> 01:29:23,363
They gonna dig up the Eiffel Tower,

1336
01:29:23,572 --> 01:29:25,824
Statue of Liberty and the Empire State.

1337
01:29:26,033 --> 01:29:27,951
But if a nigga
wanna know about me?

1338
01:29:28,160 --> 01:29:29,870
Wanna know about Memphis?

1339
01:29:30,078 --> 01:29:34,666
All they gotta do is find your
first underground tape, nigga.

1340
01:29:34,875 --> 01:29:39,004
<i>North Third Thugs</i>. Motherfuck it,
man. That was the shit.

1341
01:29:39,213 --> 01:29:42,758
You know, I cut that shit in my
own mama's laundry room, man.

1342
01:29:42,966 --> 01:29:44,218
Boy, it was raw as hell,

1343
01:29:44,426 --> 01:29:47,012
but I put everything I had
into that shit, man.

1344
01:29:47,221 --> 01:29:50,933
Yeah, but see, to me that was a sign
of your genius, you know?

1345
01:29:51,141 --> 01:29:55,562
See, because it's not enough
for a man to climb Mount Everest.

1346
01:29:55,729 --> 01:29:58,106
You know, he gotta do that shit
with the least amount of tools.

1347
01:29:58,315 --> 01:30:01,318
- It's about the man. One man.
- One man and his skills.

1348
01:30:01,527 --> 01:30:04,238
Like the samurai say, "The sword is
only as powerful as its master."

1349
01:30:04,446 --> 01:30:07,908
And it ain't the size
of the dog in the fight, it's the size

1350
01:30:08,075 --> 01:30:10,327
- of the fight in the dog, nigga.
- Of the fight in the dog.

1351
01:30:10,536 --> 01:30:12,412
- My nigga.
- My nigga. Shit.

1352
01:30:12,621 --> 01:30:14,623
You know, and I know
a nigga like you, man,

1353
01:30:14,831 --> 01:30:16,708
a man gotta do
what a man gotta do, right?

1354
01:30:16,917 --> 01:30:19,127
You know, sometimes a nigga
gotta surround himself

1355
01:30:19,336 --> 01:30:20,754
with a whole bunch
of motherfuckers

1356
01:30:20,963 --> 01:30:24,383
that think they got a say
in who the fuck Skinny Black is.

1357
01:30:24,591 --> 01:30:26,677
Yeah, they pimping me.
I ain't gonna lie about that.

1358
01:30:26,885 --> 01:30:28,470
Gotta break bread with all these

1359
01:30:28,679 --> 01:30:31,139
number-crunching motherfuckers,
man. It ain't like it used to be.

1360
01:30:31,348 --> 01:30:33,851
Hey, baby, you ain't gotta explain
a damn thing to me, man.

1361
01:30:34,059 --> 01:30:35,602
Because I'm always
gonna be here for you.

1362
01:30:35,811 --> 01:30:39,565
Same way we was here for you
way back in the day.

1363
01:30:39,773 --> 01:30:41,733
- Oh, man.
- He got a cassette tape.

1364
01:30:41,942 --> 01:30:44,695
- Remember that?
- This nigga tripping, man.

1365
01:30:44,903 --> 01:30:46,572
Man, look at this shit!

1366
01:30:46,780 --> 01:30:50,242
Tigga, Slobs, you see what this nigga
got, man? My underground, man.

1367
01:30:50,450 --> 01:30:53,412
Where the fuck you get this from?
I ain't even got no more of these left!

1368
01:30:54,830 --> 01:30:58,041
Skinny, you got thousands of those
left in you.

1369
01:30:58,417 --> 01:31:03,213
All you gotta do is just come back
home, man. Because we miss you.

1370
01:31:05,716 --> 01:31:07,593
Come home, man.

1371
01:31:14,308 --> 01:31:16,351
You stand behind your product, nigga?

1372
01:31:21,773 --> 01:31:24,276
Is a pig's pussy pork?

1373
01:31:51,261 --> 01:31:53,805
I had this Mustang, right?

1374
01:31:54,431 --> 01:31:57,476
Motherfucking tight-ass ride!
You hear me?

1375
01:31:57,684 --> 01:31:59,061
Hood snout.

1376
01:31:59,269 --> 01:32:01,271
- What the fuck is a hood snout?
- Maple dash.

1377
01:32:01,480 --> 01:32:04,358
It's the goddamn hood come up,
like that from the sides,

1378
01:32:04,566 --> 01:32:05,859
- like a fucking nose.
- Okay.

1379
01:32:06,026 --> 01:32:08,529
- Hood snout, maple dash.
- Shit.

1380
01:32:08,737 --> 01:32:11,281
You know what I mean?
Two-tone metallic monster

1381
01:32:11,490 --> 01:32:14,201
- motherfucker, you know?
- I hear you.

1382
01:32:14,409 --> 01:32:16,703
So I go to my lady's crib
over there in The Courts, right?

1383
01:32:16,912 --> 01:32:18,997
- You had one in The Courts?
- I had one in The Courts.

1384
01:32:19,206 --> 01:32:22,417
- You had one in The Courts?
- I had a few of them in The Courts.

1385
01:32:22,626 --> 01:32:26,004
So, look, man, I go up in there, right?
I get my ugly on real quick,

1386
01:32:26,213 --> 01:32:29,049
come out, my ride is gone!
You hear me?

1387
01:32:29,216 --> 01:32:30,717
- Gone in 60 seconds?
- Gone in 60...

1388
01:32:30,926 --> 01:32:32,135
And I nut pretty damn fast,

1389
01:32:32,344 --> 01:32:36,056
so them niggas must've
took my ride like that! You hear me?

1390
01:32:36,265 --> 01:32:39,935
So I call up my crew. I call my crew
up, I'm like, "Come pick me up."

1391
01:32:40,143 --> 01:32:43,438
Because I know there's only one place
them niggas going riding in my car.

1392
01:32:43,647 --> 01:32:45,274
That's motherfucking
Millbranch, man.

1393
01:32:45,482 --> 01:32:49,027
Millbranch. Millbranch, right?

1394
01:32:49,486 --> 01:32:51,363
So we go down to Millbranch,
and we wait.

1395
01:32:51,572 --> 01:32:55,909
And sure enough, just like I said,
not even an hour go by,

1396
01:32:56,118 --> 01:32:58,245
and these niggas
coming in my ride, right?

1397
01:32:58,453 --> 01:33:01,039
So we roll up in front. We box them in.

1398
01:33:01,290 --> 01:33:02,749
Next thing you know,
20 motherfuckers

1399
01:33:02,916 --> 01:33:05,210
come rushing at these niggas,
pulling them out of my car.

1400
01:33:05,419 --> 01:33:07,087
I'm just screaming
like a little bitch, like,

1401
01:33:07,254 --> 01:33:09,381
"Don't touch my car!
Don't touch my car!"

1402
01:33:09,590 --> 01:33:12,801
Tripping, man. I can sit back
and laugh about it now,

1403
01:33:13,010 --> 01:33:16,054
but goddamn it, it wasn't funny then.
You hear me? At all.

1404
01:33:16,263 --> 01:33:19,850
You know, I'm sitting here
listening to you, man.

1405
01:33:20,058 --> 01:33:23,061
And you ain't bragging and shit,
man, you just telling me how it is

1406
01:33:23,270 --> 01:33:25,939
being on the side of the moon
that you see from.

1407
01:33:26,148 --> 01:33:28,108
And I realize a nigga like me ain't...

1408
01:33:28,275 --> 01:33:30,944
I ain't but a slice of cheese
off your motherfucking cracker, man.

1409
01:33:31,153 --> 01:33:33,614
- Right.
- You know...

1410
01:33:34,698 --> 01:33:37,159
...but I got this thing right here.

1411
01:33:37,367 --> 01:33:39,161
My motherfucking heart
beats in this thing, man.

1412
01:33:39,369 --> 01:33:41,079
Fuck I'm gonna do
with a cassette tape, man?

1413
01:33:41,288 --> 01:33:44,166
See, that's my blood pumped
in this shit, man.

1414
01:33:44,374 --> 01:33:46,084
Dog, do you know it's
a new millennium, nigga?

1415
01:33:46,293 --> 01:33:47,961
I can't do nothing
with no cassette tape.

1416
01:33:48,128 --> 01:33:49,796
I don't even have
a cassette-tape player.

1417
01:33:50,005 --> 01:33:52,382
- What the fuck is this shit here?
- I ain't trying to play you.

1418
01:33:52,591 --> 01:33:55,511
I appreciate the fact you talking
to me man-to-man like this and shit.

1419
01:33:55,719 --> 01:33:57,930
Hell, treating me like an equal, man.

1420
01:33:58,138 --> 01:34:01,725
And the only reason I give you
that right there is because...

1421
01:34:01,934 --> 01:34:04,144
...you know, you and me,
we come from the same place,

1422
01:34:04,353 --> 01:34:06,563
- you know what I mean?
- Right. That's the truth, man.

1423
01:34:06,772 --> 01:34:09,858
- Hell, we old friends, man.
- Definitely. Definitely old friends, man.

1424
01:34:10,067 --> 01:34:12,277
And I'm gonna tell you something.

1425
01:34:12,486 --> 01:34:13,570
I miss you, Jay.

1426
01:34:14,154 --> 01:34:17,324
- Man, it's Djay, man!
- Djay.

1427
01:34:17,533 --> 01:34:19,451
- Djay, man!
- Djay, my bad, nigga.

1428
01:34:19,660 --> 01:34:21,370
- My bad. Djay, Djay.
- Djay.

1429
01:34:21,578 --> 01:34:24,665
You know, in real life, man,

1430
01:34:24,957 --> 01:34:28,710
you know, if you give me a shot...

1431
01:34:29,461 --> 01:34:31,296
...you know, just...

1432
01:34:31,505 --> 01:34:34,716
Just give me a chance
to get my voice heard, man,

1433
01:34:34,925 --> 01:34:36,969
you know, I wouldn't...

1434
01:34:38,220 --> 01:34:40,389
I think I wouldn't even have words
for that shit, man.

1435
01:34:41,431 --> 01:34:44,059
Let me tell you something, man.
Look here.

1436
01:34:44,268 --> 01:34:46,353
- Got something I wanna tell you.
- Shit, he getting up.

1437
01:34:46,562 --> 01:34:48,397
- Don't get up.
- Listen to me, this is important.

1438
01:34:48,605 --> 01:34:50,440
Now, this is serious. Look at me.

1439
01:34:50,649 --> 01:34:52,484
Look at me, man.

1440
01:34:53,193 --> 01:34:55,028
- Okay, man.
- You laughing, this shit ain't funny.

1441
01:34:55,237 --> 01:34:57,489
- I'm serious, now.
- Okay, I'm with you.

1442
01:34:57,698 --> 01:35:00,659
Everybody gotta have a dream, boy.

1443
01:35:00,868 --> 01:35:04,121
Everybody got to have a dream.
You hear me?

1444
01:35:04,329 --> 01:35:06,540
I hear you, man.

1445
01:35:06,915 --> 01:35:09,376
- You know what I'm talking about?
- Don't make... Don't fall, man!

1446
01:35:09,543 --> 01:35:11,670
I can't help you, man.

1447
01:35:13,881 --> 01:35:15,549
Where the bathroom at?

1448
01:35:15,716 --> 01:35:18,135
Nigga, over there, man. Go get it.

1449
01:35:19,178 --> 01:35:20,554
Hey.

1450
01:35:20,721 --> 01:35:24,808
Hey, hey, man.
You better help your nigga, man.

1451
01:35:39,948 --> 01:35:41,575
Thank you.

1452
01:35:45,120 --> 01:35:46,914
- I didn't think it was going in.
- How'd it go?

1453
01:35:47,080 --> 01:35:48,999
Played it like a pro, man.

1454
01:35:49,208 --> 01:35:50,709
My mode is just...

1455
01:35:50,918 --> 01:35:52,961
Just pounding in my head now.

1456
01:35:53,170 --> 01:35:54,254
I mean, and it's...

1457
01:35:54,463 --> 01:35:56,715
It's hard in my heart right now.

1458
01:35:57,424 --> 01:35:59,343
All that boy gotta do is just
play the damn thing,

1459
01:35:59,551 --> 01:36:03,430
and it's gonna be undeniable, man.
Undeniable, baby.

1460
01:36:06,850 --> 01:36:10,812
I think you gonna have to get your
weed from some other hustler, man.

1461
01:36:11,772 --> 01:36:15,526
You're on your way.
You're on your way.

1462
01:36:18,737 --> 01:36:20,614
Hey...

1463
01:36:22,157 --> 01:36:24,243
...I got something for you.

1464
01:36:28,705 --> 01:36:32,000
Thank you for everything, man.

1465
01:36:34,461 --> 01:36:36,922
Let me get my jacket, man.

1466
01:36:41,176 --> 01:36:44,263
I'm gonna take me a piss,
and I'm gonna roll, baby.

1467
01:36:44,471 --> 01:36:46,598
You take care of yourself.

1468
01:36:46,807 --> 01:36:51,395
I will. Next time you see me, man,
I'm gonna be 100 feet tall, man.

1469
01:37:12,249 --> 01:37:14,334
Talking all this...

1470
01:37:14,543 --> 01:37:16,628
Shit, I can't...

1471
01:37:18,505 --> 01:37:21,049
Nigga talking to me.
I don't care about that shit, man.

1472
01:37:21,258 --> 01:37:23,510
Hey, Skinny, man.

1473
01:37:23,719 --> 01:37:26,180
You need to take a piss?

1474
01:37:26,346 --> 01:37:28,140
Hey, baby, let's try this shit
standing up.

1475
01:37:28,348 --> 01:37:29,308
Come on, man. Come on.

1476
01:37:29,516 --> 01:37:32,561
- Now, don't try...
- Come on. Big motherfucker.

1477
01:37:32,769 --> 01:37:35,063
Nigga talking to me
about his bullshit.

1478
01:37:35,272 --> 01:37:37,524
Nigga, I'm talking to you, man.

1479
01:37:37,691 --> 01:37:41,403
I'm talking to you, dog. You need
a little help, okay? Stay with me here.

1480
01:37:41,904 --> 01:37:44,990
I'm gonna pull your pants up, nigga.
I ain't no faggot or nothing.

1481
01:37:45,199 --> 01:37:47,534
You know, shit, ain't too many men

1482
01:37:47,701 --> 01:37:50,787
pull a nigga's dick up for him. Shit.

1483
01:37:51,413 --> 01:37:53,832
You better show me some love
for this one, man.

1484
01:37:54,041 --> 01:37:55,876
You know, one day...

1485
01:37:56,084 --> 01:37:58,045
One day, you and me
gonna be on tour, man.

1486
01:37:58,253 --> 01:38:00,047
- I ain't gonna do this shit for you.
- Tour?

1487
01:38:00,255 --> 01:38:01,882
- What tour you taking about?
- Shit, man.

1488
01:38:02,090 --> 01:38:03,300
Man, you know, a fucked-up nigga

1489
01:38:03,509 --> 01:38:06,178
would do some wild shit
to you right now.

1490
01:38:06,386 --> 01:38:09,306
Hey, hey, hey. Come on, man.
Come on, come on, come on.

1491
01:38:09,515 --> 01:38:11,892
Come on, baby.
Let's get the fuck up...

1492
01:39:00,983 --> 01:39:03,235
Hey, Skinny, man.

1493
01:39:03,777 --> 01:39:07,614
You tell me this shit

1494
01:39:11,952 --> 01:39:13,453
Skinny?

1495
01:39:13,662 --> 01:39:15,122
Hey, bitch.

01:39:15,289 --> 01:39:17,124
You tell me this shit fell out

1497
01:39:17,291 --> 01:39:20,169
- Hey, hey, hey, man.

1498
01:39:20,377 --> 01:39:22,379
You know what you could do?

1499
01:39:22,588 --> 01:39:26,175
What can I do, man?
You tell me what I can do, man.

1500
01:39:27,134 --> 01:39:30,596
You can suck my dick, bitch.

1501
01:39:30,804 --> 01:39:33,974
Hey, bitch, why don't you
suck on this shit? Motherfucker!

1502
01:39:44,651 --> 01:39:46,195
This what the fuck you want, man?

1503
01:39:46,403 --> 01:39:48,780
This what the fuck you want, man?

1504
01:39:55,037 --> 01:39:56,997
Oh, shit.

1505
01:40:03,212 --> 01:40:04,546
Oh, God.

1506
01:40:04,755 --> 01:40:07,633
Oh, Skinny, man.
Hey. Hey, nigga.

1507
01:40:07,841 --> 01:40:10,761
Hey, Skinny! Hey, Skinny,

1508
01:40:10,969 --> 01:40:13,305
Skinny, come on, man!
Come on, man. Come on, nigga.

1509
01:40:13,514 --> 01:40:15,849
Breathe, you motherfucker!

1510
01:40:16,016 --> 01:40:18,101
Hey, yo, Skin...
What the..?!

1511
01:40:19,061 --> 01:40:20,646
Shit!

1512
01:40:21,939 --> 01:40:23,899
Get the fuck up! Get your ass up!

1513
01:40:24,107 --> 01:40:26,068
Get your ass up, motherfucker!

1514
01:40:26,276 --> 01:40:27,778
- Oh, shit!

1515
01:40:27,986 --> 01:40:28,946
I'm coming out now!

1516
01:40:29,154 --> 01:40:31,031
If I see any gleam, motherfuckers,

1517
01:40:31,198 --> 01:40:32,991
I'm gonna shoot this motherfucker
in his head!

1518
01:40:33,200 --> 01:40:34,284
- Shoot this nigga!
- Get him!

1519
01:40:34,493 --> 01:40:35,994
- Shoot this nigga!
- Fuck off, bitch!

1520
01:40:36,203 --> 01:40:37,829
Hey, niggas, back the fuck up!

1521
01:40:38,038 --> 01:40:40,916
- Not tonight, nigga! Not tonight!
- Shoot him! Shoot him!

1522
01:41:24,918 --> 01:41:26,378
There he is!
There that motherfucker go!

1523
01:41:26,587 --> 01:41:27,921
- Right there!
- Away from the door.

1524
01:41:28,088 --> 01:41:30,215
Hey, man, I ain't armed.
It's in the glove.

1525
01:41:30,424 --> 01:41:33,385
- It's in the glove, man.
- Djay! Djay!

1526
01:41:33,594 --> 01:41:35,596
Hey, wait, man! Hey, Shug, it's okay.
Hey, wait!

1527
01:41:36,013 --> 01:41:37,306
- Hey, get off my foot, man.
- Djay!

1528
01:41:37,514 --> 01:41:38,473
Hey lay off my foot, man!

1529
01:41:38,682 --> 01:41:40,475
- Fuck you, man! Hey, man!
- Get down on the car!

1530
01:41:40,684 --> 01:41:44,229
- Hey, get them off my girl!
- Hey, get your hands off her!

1531
01:41:44,438 --> 01:41:45,856
Hey, man!

1532
01:41:46,064 --> 01:41:47,900
- Fuck!
- What the fuck's up now, nigga?

1533
01:41:48,108 --> 01:41:50,652
- Bust his motherfucking head, man.
- Nigga, come on, come on.

1534
01:41:50,861 --> 01:41:52,696
Djay, please, what did you do?

1535
01:41:53,113 --> 01:41:55,490
Hey, man! Come on, man!
He turned himself in, man!

1536
01:41:55,949 --> 01:41:58,410
You ain't gotta dog-pile
on him like that!

1537
01:41:58,619 --> 01:42:00,954
Hey, yo, she pregnant, man!

1538
01:42:01,914 --> 01:42:03,790
Don't forget, man,
you knock this motherfucker out.

1539
01:42:03,957 --> 01:42:06,710
He's gonna have to come around here.

1540
01:42:07,044 --> 01:42:09,588
Djay, tell me what to do, please.

1541
01:42:09,796 --> 01:42:12,174
Please tell me what to do.

1542
01:42:12,382 --> 01:42:14,426
Baby, take my pad.

1543
01:42:15,135 --> 01:42:17,804
I want you to get that shit up
on the radio.

1544
01:42:18,013 --> 01:42:20,682
You put it in the DJ's hand
yourself, you hear me?

1545
01:42:20,891 --> 01:42:21,934
- Okay, I will.
- Get him up.

1546
01:42:22,142 --> 01:42:24,478
I got a stack of demos
right there in the car.

1547
01:42:24,686 --> 01:42:28,273
I want you to get Key and them...
Key, y'all put my shit on CD!

1548
01:42:28,482 --> 01:42:29,441
All right, man!

1549
01:42:30,484 --> 01:42:32,319
Nola, you in charge and shit,
all right?

1550
01:42:32,486 --> 01:42:35,489
In two weeks, I wanna hear my shit
in the yard at 2:01, you hear me?

1551
01:42:37,282 --> 01:42:39,868
- Get him!
- Motherfucker!

1552
01:42:41,328 --> 01:42:44,414
- Bitch!
- Don't hit him like that!

1553
01:42:45,207 --> 01:42:48,252
Get him! Bitch!

1554
01:42:48,460 --> 01:42:49,670
D!

1555
01:42:51,380 --> 01:42:53,841
I wanna hear my shit in the yard,
you hear me.

1556
01:42:54,007 --> 01:42:56,093
You in charge.
I wanna hear you say that.

1557
01:42:56,301 --> 01:42:57,928
- Say it!
- I'm in charge.

1558
01:42:58,136 --> 01:42:59,513
- You my partner.
- I know.

1559
01:42:59,721 --> 01:43:03,016
- Say, "I'm in charge!"
- I'm in charge!

1560
01:43:06,478 --> 01:43:08,355
- All right, man.
- Get in the car.

1561
01:43:08,689 --> 01:43:09,815
Watch your head.

1562
01:43:10,023 --> 01:43:12,150
I'm in charge.

1563
01:43:12,359 --> 01:43:13,485
Me. I promise.

1564
01:43:31,545 --> 01:43:33,755
Go get down in the yard.

1565
01:44:09,583 --> 01:44:12,586
I tried calling the house, you know...

1566
01:44:12,920 --> 01:44:16,548
...but the phone's just...
- They shut them off.

1567
01:44:19,051 --> 01:44:21,386
But me and Yevette, we...

1568
01:44:21,762 --> 01:44:23,514
We chipping in.

1569
01:44:23,847 --> 01:44:25,474
Thank you.

1570
01:44:32,940 --> 01:44:35,234
She precious, man.

1571
01:44:36,527 --> 01:44:38,320
Beautiful little girl.

1572
01:44:42,074 --> 01:44:44,618
- Named her Keisha.
- Keisha.

1573
01:44:46,245 --> 01:44:48,497
That's a good handle, man.

1574
01:44:48,789 --> 01:44:50,457
I like that.

1575
01:44:52,042 --> 01:44:54,044
You know, with all I gotta do...

1576
01:44:54,711 --> 01:44:57,756
...all these people in my life, man...

1577
01:44:59,800 --> 01:45:02,427
...feels like an eternity in here.

1578
01:45:03,637 --> 01:45:06,473
Can't seem to find my mode now.

1579
01:45:07,099 --> 01:45:09,393
Don't hear a damn thing.

1580
01:45:11,186 --> 01:45:12,813
Djay...

1581
01:45:18,235 --> 01:45:21,154
...did you know Skinny Black
before that night?

1582
01:45:28,829 --> 01:45:31,665
You know that
little girl Keisha, right?

1583
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,335
One day she gonna dream big,

1584
01:45:35,502 --> 01:45:38,046
the way kids do, you know.

1585
01:45:38,422 --> 01:45:41,925
And she gonna come to me
and ask me

1586
01:45:42,134 --> 01:45:46,138
when she grow up,
can she become president?

1587
01:45:47,222 --> 01:45:51,101
Now, I know that little girl got a ho
for a mama and a trick for a daddy,

1588
01:45:51,310 --> 01:45:53,896
that nobody even know where he at.

1589
01:45:54,855 --> 01:45:56,982
But I tell you something.

1590
01:45:58,066 --> 01:46:00,444
I'm gonna look her right in the eye...

1591
01:46:01,278 --> 01:46:03,322
...and I'm gonna lie.

1592
01:46:04,072 --> 01:46:06,867
Because sometimes
that's what you gotta do.

1593
01:46:17,252 --> 01:46:19,713
How you been doing, man?

1594
01:46:24,468 --> 01:46:26,887
Back to the same old shit.

1595
01:46:27,054 --> 01:46:31,016
About six months ago,
my neighbor brought my mail.

1596
01:46:31,225 --> 01:46:34,228
It was mail that she'd gotten
from her neighbor.

1597
01:46:34,436 --> 01:46:35,938
It was addressed to me.

1598
01:46:36,146 --> 01:46:39,900
<i>The court depositions</i>
<i>and the high school recitals.</i>

1599
01:46:41,401 --> 01:46:43,779
<i>Talk about eternity, man.</i>

1600
01:46:44,821 --> 01:46:47,115
<i>It's been on my mind too.</i>

1601
01:46:49,660 --> 01:46:52,204
<i>It's on all our minds.</i>

1602
01:46:52,412 --> 01:46:55,040
<i>We was just dead, Djay.</i>

1603
01:46:55,582 --> 01:46:58,126
<i>Locked up, just like you.</i>

1604
01:46:59,878 --> 01:47:03,715
<i>But ain't no sorrow gonna</i>
<i>take away Shug's song.</i>

1605
01:47:03,924 --> 01:47:05,884
<i>Let me tell you that.</i>

1606
01:47:06,134 --> 01:47:08,804
<i>That woman, she got love for you.</i>

1607
01:47:10,013 --> 01:47:12,641
<i>So when you talk about eternity...</i>

1608
01:47:13,851 --> 01:47:16,061
...you think about your woman.

1609
01:47:18,981 --> 01:47:21,483
- Hey, how's Nola, man?
- Nola?

1610
01:47:22,651 --> 01:47:25,320
Let me tell you something, man.

1611
01:47:25,988 --> 01:47:28,782
That girl got a mode all her own.

1612
01:47:35,998 --> 01:47:37,958
<i>She hit the bricks running.</i>

1613
01:47:38,166 --> 01:47:41,879
<i>For some reason, she got it stuck</i>
<i>in her head that she was in charge.</i>

1614
01:47:42,087 --> 01:47:47,467
We can't lay around licking our ass
all day like a dog, you know?

1615
01:47:47,634 --> 01:47:50,262
I mean, we man.

1616
01:47:50,470 --> 01:47:55,309
I mean, I know I'm a girl and all,
but we mankind.

1617
01:47:55,976 --> 01:47:57,895
<i>Man, she hit every shake joint,</i>

1618
01:47:58,103 --> 01:48:01,398
<i>radio station in Memphis</i>
<i>and then some.</i>

1619
01:48:01,648 --> 01:48:03,483
<i>I don't know how she did it.</i>

1620
01:48:03,650 --> 01:48:06,236
<i>That girl got skills.</i>

1621
01:48:18,540 --> 01:48:20,501
<i>Power 107. 1.</i>
<i>Number one for hip-hop.</i>

1622
01:48:20,667 --> 01:48:22,461
<i>This your man Boogaloo</i>
<i>holding you down.</i>

1623
01:48:22,669 --> 01:48:25,631
<i>Man, I got a brand-new exclusive</i>
<i>from my man Djay.</i>

1624

1625

of the law, being from the streets

1653
01:50:18,869 --> 01:50:20,204

and tell us what you think.

1659
01:50:40,849 --> 01:50:43,185
Well, you know what they say.

01:50:44,561 --> 01:50:46,980
Everybody gotta have a dream.
