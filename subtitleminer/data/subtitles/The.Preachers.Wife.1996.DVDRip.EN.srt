I learned all about miracles.

[Young Woman]Joe Hamilton's tearin'
down everything. Why's he doin' it?

180
00:10:53,207 --> 00:10:55,542
Yeah, man, where're we
supposed to chill at now?

181
00:10:55,607 --> 00:10:58,422
They're tryin' to see us
get locked up or shot or something.

182
00:10:58,487 --> 00:11:01,302
Listen to me, listen. It just means
you've got to work that much harder...

183
00:11:01,367 --> 00:11:03,439
try that much harder
to stay out of trouble.

- I'm gonna do my thing.
- Peace, man.

186
00:11:09,623 --> 00:11:12,689
- I don't know, man.

187
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:14,614
Yeah, you tried.

- Thank you, son.
- Bye.

189

- Y'all take care of yourselves.
- What do you want to do?

190
00:11:19,383 --> 00:11:22,831
- I don't know.
- Well, it's too cold to stay out.

191
00:11:24,727 --> 00:11:26,582
Tough break, huh?

192
00:11:26,647 --> 00:11:28,654
Kinda seems like
they're all tough these days.

00:11:41,719 --> 00:11:44,086
- No. No, no.
- Social worker?

199
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:47,184
- No, I'm here in answer to your request.
- My request?

200
00:11:47,287 --> 00:11:49,109
For help?

201
00:11:50,391 --> 00:11:52,530
Is this some kind of joke?

202
00:11:52,599 --> 00:11:55,086
Uh, no, no.
He doesn't make jokes.

203
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:57,101
He?

Capital "H", capital "E".

205
00:12:05,847 --> 00:12:08,083
I want you to know that
together the three of us...

206
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:10,485
can help get you through
this little crisis you're having.

207
00:12:10,551 --> 00:12:13,136
- Look, I don't know who you are.
- Dudley, I'm Dudley.

208
00:12:13,206 --> 00:12:15,061
- Or who put you up to this.
- He did.

209
00:12:15,126 --> 00:12:17,941
But I'm afraid you picked
the wrong day for me to be a good sport.

210
00:12:18,006 --> 00:12:19,861
- Now, will you excuse me?
- Sure.

211
00:12:19,926 --> 00:12:23,374
- Thank you.
- Wow.

212
00:12:23,447 --> 00:12:25,335
I'm sorry.

213
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:29,043
I'll, uh...

214
00:12:29,111 --> 00:12:32,275
try another approach.

215
00:12:32,343 --> 00:12:37,133
- Ho, ho, ho.
- Thank you, sister. Merry Christmas.

216
00:12:37,206 --> 00:12:40,174
I've been waitin' a long time for this.

217
00:12:40,247 --> 00:12:42,865
- Yeah?
- Yes, sir.

218
00:12:44,823 --> 00:12:47,190
Mmm.
Oh, yeah.

219
00:12:47,287 --> 00:12:50,102
Hey, don't that cheese
burn the roof of your mouth?

220
00:12:50,167 --> 00:12:53,331
Hmm?
[Puffs]

[Puffing]

223
00:12:58,967 --> 00:13:01,650
Uh, you...
you know Reverend Biggs?

224
00:13:01,719 --> 00:13:05,014
- Sure, from St. Matt's.
- Yeah, that's the one.

225
00:13:05,079 --> 00:13:08,691
Stubborn, isn't he? Kinda short
with people too. Didn't you notice?

226
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:12,108
This man right here?

227
00:13:12,183 --> 00:13:15,052
Not that I know him that well.
I'm just...

228
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:19,469
- He came to the hospital every
day after my wife's surgery.
- Every day?

229
00:13:19,542 --> 00:13:21,517
He baptized all five of my kids.

230
00:13:21,591 --> 00:13:23,631
- All five of them?
- Yeah. Give me this.

231
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:27,445
- Wait. I didn't mean anything.
- Go on, get on out of here!

232
00:13:27,511 --> 00:13:30,827
You better go. Get on outta here.
And don't come back.

233
00:13:30,903 --> 00:13:33,937
I'm telling you, Mama, he was there.

234
00:13:34,007 --> 00:13:35,861
Like he fell from the sky.

235
00:13:35,927 --> 00:13:38,480
Then he did a dance and jumped around.

236
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:41,136
Mommy's gonna stop giving you
sugar cereal in the morning, baby.

237
00:13:41,207 --> 00:13:43,182
- Come on. Who's that?
- Ho, ho, ho.

238

- Santa Claus!
- Merry Christmas!

Ho, ho, ho, ho.
Merry Christmas, Santa.

240
00:13:48,407 --> 00:13:50,741
- Thank you, little bro.
- Here, put some money in.

241
00:13:50,807 --> 00:13:54,898
Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.

00:13:54,966 --> 00:13:57,301
- Mmm-mmm-mmm.
- Thank you, sir.

00:13:57,367 --> 00:14:00,433
- Merry Christmas.
- Same to you, buddy.

244
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:03,318
- Osbert! Merry Christmas!
- How've you been, sister?

- [Gasping]
- Shh. Mm-mm.

- Ho, ho, ho!

247
00:14:10,199 --> 00:14:12,173
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you, brother.

248

- Amen.
- Amen.

250
00:14:18,806 --> 00:14:20,748
Okay, fella, let's get into bed.

All right.

I'm going to be sad when he goes.

We all will.

255
00:14:34,326 --> 00:14:36,912
We'll all miss Hakim.

256
00:14:36,983 --> 00:14:39,830
Will I have to go
live with another family too?

257
00:14:41,527 --> 00:14:45,072
Of course not, Jeremiah.
Of course not.

258
00:14:48,663 --> 00:14:50,518
Get some sleep.

259
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:53,234
I will if you sing to me.

- Turn around!
- That ain't mine, man. He dropped it.

284
00:16:28,918 --> 00:16:32,333
- Get against the wall.
- I was returning a tape, man.
I live right down the street.

That was you.
I saw you break my window!

him in handcuffs? He's not a criminal.

290
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:50,483
Do you think they'll give him dinner?
He hasn't had anything since lunch.

291
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:53,201
- I know he's hungry.
- He'll just be there overnight.

292
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:55,856
His bail hearing will be set
for sometime tomorrow.

293
00:16:55,927 --> 00:16:58,196

in trouble before?

- Two years ago.
- Oh, great!

295
00:17:01,431 --> 00:17:05,009
I was able to get the judge to give him
probation, as long as I found him a job.

- And you did.
- I promised I would straighten him out.

such a good job.

I'm an angel.

I beg your pardon?

343
00:19:25,302 --> 00:19:27,342

You know, like in the Bible?

I know you don't believe me.
It's hard, even for you.

But angels cannot lie, Henry. We're not
allowed to. It's in the angel handbook.

But, as you can see,
I was cut down in my prime.

Yeah. Mm-hmm.

365
00:20:36,023 --> 00:20:37,997
Ever since then, Henry,
I've been up there...

366

to get sent back down here.

- It's a long line, too, let me tell you.
- You don't say.

Oh, I do say.

is like just to get sent down here.

He sent me, Henry, but I'm glad He did.

372
00:20:51,606 --> 00:20:54,421
- Yeah.
- And I'm going to do everything I can
to help you.

373
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:57,966
- Thank you very much.
- Oh, I need to go over the rules,
if that's okay with you?

374
00:20:58,038 --> 00:21:01,966
- Oh, no, no, no. That's not necessary.
- It'll only take a second, Henry.

375
00:21:02,038 --> 00:21:05,617
- Oh, all right.
- "Rule Number One: We can't do
anything you should be doing."

376
00:21:05,687 --> 00:21:09,364
That makes sense. If I'm doing it,
that'd be two of us, wouldn't it?

377
00:21:09,431 --> 00:21:13,489
Exactly. "Number Two: Everything you do
must be done of your own free will."

378
00:21:13,558 --> 00:21:17,617
- Now, that's a biggie.
- Tough, but fair. Are there many more?

379
00:21:17,686 --> 00:21:20,883
Finally, when I leave,
when the mission is accomplished,
you won't have any memory of me.

That's my favorite.

Okay, so I got my rules.
Where can I drop you?

This is all I need.

Come on. Careful.
Be careful.

464
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:42,645
Julia, get everyone
out of the building.

Come on, hurry, hurry.
Henry! The boiler!

- Yeah, I know it.

Do you need anything?

[Chattering]

in that basement there.

Don't slip. I got it.

Oh, no, no!

Look at this.

475
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:15,412
Aww. Oh, no.

476
00:26:15,478 --> 00:26:18,860
You could have given us
one more winter.

477
00:26:22,198 --> 00:26:24,915
- Is it open?
- Yes, Jeremiah. I left it open.

478
00:26:24,982 --> 00:26:27,403
- Okay? All right. Sleep well.
- Okay.

Good night, Mommy.

What a night.

I don't even want
to think about tomorrow...

482

between the boiler and Hakim leaving.

483
00:26:37,558 --> 00:26:40,689
Now, why... why are they
gonna send that boy...

484
00:26:40,758 --> 00:26:42,929
to a foster home so far away?

485
00:26:42,998 --> 00:26:44,853
I knew I should have called...

Honey, you called half
the agencies in the state.

I know, I know.

But maybe the answer
was in the other half.

I'm losing them, Julia.

I know it's my fault,
but I just can't seem...

493
00:27:10,102 --> 00:27:13,876
- You know, honey,
I had some thoughts on...
- Can we do this in the morning?

'Cause I'm beat.

Anybody wanna open it?

Oh. Well, I'll just
take my coat off...

501
00:27:49,366 --> 00:27:51,602
and bring it on
into the office, then.

502
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:55,729
Look, I know things have been tough
around here lately, and that's my fault.

503
00:27:55,798 --> 00:27:57,969
But everything is gonna be all right.

Hello? Who?

506
00:28:04,278 --> 00:28:06,612
- Mm-hmm.
- If only saying it made it all right.

507
00:28:06,678 --> 00:28:09,231
- Yeah.
- You see? If you'd listened,
you'd have heard an apology.

508
00:28:09,302 --> 00:28:11,058
Not a big one, but a start.

509
00:28:11,125 --> 00:28:13,133
- Uh-huh.
- No, what I heard is a man saying...

510
00:28:13,206 --> 00:28:16,369
"How can I deal with this fast enough,
then get on with the rest of my day?"

511
00:28:16,438 --> 00:28:19,536
- You see, that's not fair.
- Oh, it's not fair?

00:28:19,606 --> 00:28:21,995
Girl, I'm trying to listen!

513
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:25,518
[Laughs] Yeah, I'll give him
the message. Uh-huh.

514
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:27,891
We've got to stop talking around Mama.
She knows too much of our business.

515
00:28:27,957 --> 00:28:31,754
That was Anna Eldridge. Billy's
bail hearing's been scheduled for 9:30.

9:30! We'll finish this later, honey.
I promise.

- Are you coming home after?
- Not right after.

518

- I have to be somewhere at 11:00.
- Joe Hamilton.

519
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:43,315
- Do you mind?
- Oh, Henry.

520
00:28:43,382 --> 00:28:46,643
Do I look like I mind?

521
00:28:52,886 --> 00:28:55,220
You ready to talk about this,
little girl?

522
00:28:55,318 --> 00:28:58,798
I don't know what you mean, Mama.
I think things are looking up for us.

I didn't mean to frighten you.

534

I didn't hear you come in!
You waitin' for the pastor?

Yes, yes.

- Pleasure to meet you.

You just missed him.
He went to court.

- These your children?
- Yeah, that's them.

Oh, they're beautiful.

Where was your husband?
Taking the picture?

Then he took the car and the waitress
at the diner and moved to Cleveland.

No, no, no.
It's just temporary.

00:30:28,278 --> 00:30:30,612
Temporary! I ain't heard
nothing about no temporary!

- Let me get you some coffee.
- Coffee!
You made coffee on that machine?

I've been trying for six weeks
to figure out that machine!

Look, mister, I have kids.
They're growin' like weeds.

And if you think I get a penny from that
man, you got another thought comin'!

I can't take this!
Bein' fired!

for grand jury action. Next case.

Bye, Hakim.
We'll miss you.

Hold on, baby.
It's cold out here.

a response. Who sent you, exactly?

[Dudley]
Of course it is.

621
00:34:42,198 --> 00:34:46,606
Well, it's obvious where
Julia's beauty comes from.

622
00:34:46,678 --> 00:34:50,606
Oh. And me with my hair
lookin' like this.

623
00:34:50,678 --> 00:34:53,296
- Oh, no. It looks magnificent.
- Why, thank you.

- Well, Mr., um...
- You can call me Dudley.

- Dudley. You're very welcome here.

I've heard it 100 times.

Yeah, well, maybe now,
with him around, you'll have time to
deal with some of your own problems.

I was gonna go over
by the window, Julia.

Wow, you've got a lot
of neat stuff in here.

00:36:00,885 --> 00:36:02,893
And what is this?

646
00:36:02,965 --> 00:36:05,999
My toy ambulance is broken.

The battery got stole,
and the lights don't work anymore.

Is that right?
I'll see what I can do here.

No.

You look sad there, Jeremiah.
Have you been crying?

Yes.

655

I'm sorry
about your friend, Hakim.

00:36:43,285 --> 00:36:46,417
What if I told you...

657

that he's not really gone?

658
00:36:48,725 --> 00:36:52,500
Hakim?
Did he run away and come back?

659
00:36:52,565 --> 00:36:56,788
- No, he never left.
- Yes, he did. I saw him go.

660
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:03,761
Well, you know, my mother...

661
00:37:03,829 --> 00:37:06,218
once lost someone
who was very dear to her.

662
00:37:06,325 --> 00:37:08,594
He wasn't as young as Hakim,
but he was...

663
00:37:08,662 --> 00:37:10,996
too young, just the same.

664
00:37:11,061 --> 00:37:14,989
And she would always do something
that seemed to make her feel better.

- Yeah.

All right, close your eyes.

Do you remember
playing in the snow with Hakim?

Do you remember
what his laugh sounded like?

Yes.

670

Do you remember
what he looked like catching a ball?

671
00:37:35,765 --> 00:37:41,232
He never caught the ball in his life.
But I remember.

672
00:37:41,302 --> 00:37:45,044
That's because when God
takes someone away from us...

00:50:43,124 --> 00:50:45,034
Look at that.
Day care center, youth center.

918
00:50:45,109 --> 00:50:47,530
Henry, he is building
a shrine to himself!

919
00:50:47,604 --> 00:50:51,314
Eight years, Julia.
And what do I have to show for it?

920
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:55,854
So you give up our lives
without even talking to me, Henry?

921
00:50:55,925 --> 00:50:58,608
This solves all of our problems, Julia.
Why can't you see that?

922
00:50:58,676 --> 00:51:01,938
My father trusted you with St. Matt's.
How dare you walk out on it like this!

923
00:51:02,004 --> 00:51:04,426
All right, all right.
Your father was a saint, and I'm not!

924
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:07,217
But I'm here, Julia, and he isn't.

925
00:51:10,485 --> 00:51:13,005
I'm sorry, Julia.

926
00:51:13,076 --> 00:51:15,378
Give me the car keys, Henry!

927
00:51:15,444 --> 00:51:17,964
Julia!

928
00:51:18,036 --> 00:51:20,425
- Julia, please sit down.
- Give me the keys, Henry.

929
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:24,275
Would you kindly give her the keys?
I have customers sitting here.

930
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:26,195
Sorry. Sorry.

931
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:28,365
Julia, please listen to me.

932
00:51:28,436 --> 00:51:31,949
Henry, I can't.
I don't even know who you are anymore.

933
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:34,159
Julia.

934
00:51:36,341 --> 00:51:38,762
Come on, Jeremiah.
We're leaving.

935
00:51:38,837 --> 00:51:40,746
I got Daddy's present.

936
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:43,854
And I bought a fire engine for Hakim.

937
00:51:43,925 --> 00:51:45,779
It was on sale.

938
00:51:45,845 --> 00:51:48,692
Yes, that's wonderful, honey.
That's wonderful.

939

[Car Doors Closing]

940
00:51:53,589 --> 00:51:57,451
All right. You're going to have
to support him now, Julia.

941
00:51:57,525 --> 00:52:00,340
You hear me?
Now is when he needs you most.

942
00:52:00,405 --> 00:52:02,893
Mama, I can't support what's wrong.

943
00:52:02,964 --> 00:52:06,063
Preachin' God's word is never wrong,
no matter where you do it from.

944
00:52:08,308 --> 00:52:11,178
He didn't even discuss it with me.

945
00:52:11,284 --> 00:52:13,935
Daddy would have never
made a decision like that
without discussing it with you.

946
00:52:14,004 --> 00:52:18,412
Sure he would. Your Daddy kept
things from me all the time.
Especially church business.

947
00:52:18,485 --> 00:52:20,754
Well, it was different
in those days.

948
00:52:20,821 --> 00:52:24,879
Those days!
Child, men ain't changed since Adam!

949
00:52:24,949 --> 00:52:29,356
And he gave up one of his own ribs,
just so he could have somebody
to keep things from!

950
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:37,617
You know, gettin'angry
at a dead tree is not gonna help.

951
00:52:37,685 --> 00:52:40,980
Yeah, but it wouldn't look good
to punch out a pastor, either.

952
00:52:41,044 --> 00:52:44,688
No, you don't... you don't...
you don't mean that...

953
00:52:44,757 --> 00:52:46,644
'Cause you know you love him.

954
00:52:46,708 --> 00:52:48,650
Yeah, he knows it, too.
That's the problem.

955
00:52:48,724 --> 00:52:51,953
He knows I'll always be there,
just like a pet.

956
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:54,671
- Ouch!
- See? God doesn't like ugly.

957
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:56,715
- Let me see.
- [Whimpering]

You ever had your palm read?

960
00:53:04,565 --> 00:53:07,020
Okay.

961
00:53:12,149 --> 00:53:15,923
I see a beautiful woman
with a good heart.

962
00:53:15,989 --> 00:53:20,723
Only has to open her eyes to realize
that everything she ever wanted...

963
00:53:20,789 --> 00:53:23,276
she already has.

964
00:53:23,348 --> 00:53:26,414
You didn't even look at my hand.

965
00:53:26,484 --> 00:53:29,103
But I held it.

966
00:53:29,173 --> 00:53:32,817
Do you see Henry and me?

967
00:53:32,884 --> 00:53:37,259
Hmmm... let's see.

968
00:53:37,332 --> 00:53:39,699
- Ow! Ow! Ow!
- Ohhh.

969
00:53:39,764 --> 00:53:41,935
Oh, it's so hot,
I had to let it go.

970
00:53:42,004 --> 00:53:44,339
You must be talking about my past.

00:53:44,404 --> 00:53:46,640
- Mrs. Biggs, you forgot this.
- Thanks.

972

Every fire dies sometime,
Dudley.

973
00:53:49,108 --> 00:53:52,337
What do you do when you have to decide
if the memory of it is enough?

974
00:53:52,372 --> 00:53:54,706
- What do you do?
- Yeah.

975
00:53:54,772 --> 00:53:58,155
What you do is you... you go dancing,
that's what you do. You go out.

976
00:53:58,229 --> 00:53:59,952
- Dancing?
- Yes.

977
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:04,144
You're gonna go dancing,
put on a beautiful dress,
make your husband break out the cologne.

978
00:54:04,212 --> 00:54:06,067
- Have you met my husband?
- That's right, I met him.

979
00:54:06,132 --> 00:54:09,067
- He hasn't taken me out in...
- Far too long. That's my point.

980
00:54:09,141 --> 00:54:13,069
But tonight's gonna be different.
Tonight you're gonna strike a match.

981
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:17,264
No, not a match, a, a firecracker!
You'll see.

[Chuckles]

983
00:54:19,349 --> 00:54:24,051
You take your coat off, you go upstairs
and you take your wife out dancing.

984
00:54:24,116 --> 00:54:25,971
Can't do it.
Not tonight.

985
00:54:26,036 --> 00:54:28,905
Henry, you and Julia need this.

986
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:32,722
Mr. Kingman needs his minister
with him at the hospital,
and the seniors need blankets.

987
00:54:32,789 --> 00:54:35,025
You're only one man, Henry.

988
00:54:35,092 --> 00:54:37,842
Things don't get fixed
waiting for the next guy to do it.

- Including marriages.

You already told her,
didn't you?

992
00:54:45,012 --> 00:54:47,468
She's upstairs dressing right now...

993
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:49,907
- and once again
I'm gonna look like the bad guy.

- What? I'm just trying to help you.

You're just trying to help.

996
00:54:54,612 --> 00:54:57,198
All right, you can help...
by taking her.

997
00:54:57,268 --> 00:54:59,090
- Me?
- Yes, you.

998
00:54:59,188 --> 00:55:01,425
- You're missing the point, Henry.
- No, no.

999
00:55:01,492 --> 00:55:06,031
The point is...
Mr. Kingman won't wait.

1000
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:08,849
Now, you go, tell me all about it later.

1001

- And you make sure
you tell her I'm sorry.

- Good night.

- Henry.
- Not too late.

- Henry.
- And no drinking.

to go like this.

- He said... He said he's sorry.

- He's sorry?
- Yeah, he had to go.

Oh, yeah.
He's been sick a long time.

I'll call his wife tomorrow.

Look, Julia,
he suggested that I, uh...

1021
00:56:13,588 --> 00:56:17,385
pinch-hit for him,
if that's okay with you.

I bet you're a good dancer.

It's been a long time.

You want to dance?

00:56:57,780 --> 00:56:59,820
Why not?
[Laughs]

1032
00:56:59,892 --> 00:57:02,380
- All right.
- Give it a shot.

come by here much anymore.

If Henry hadn't helped me
with that plane ticket,
I never would've gotten to Paris.

I tell you,
I owe that man everything.

- I will.

Do that.
He'd love to hear from you.

Why don't we all
just sit down and visit?

Yeah.

00:59:06,612 --> 00:59:09,907
- Okay.
- [Bandleader] Thank you. Thank you.

1068
00:59:09,972 --> 00:59:12,939
So, Bristloe,
are you and Maxine still together?

1069
00:59:13,011 --> 00:59:14,953
- Oh, you better believe it.
- Oh, good.

1070
00:59:15,028 --> 00:59:18,225
She still calls six times a day
to make sure I'm being a good boy.

1071
00:59:18,292 --> 00:59:21,805
Fine woman, that Maxine.
You married, Dudley?

1072
00:59:21,876 --> 00:59:23,785
No, no.

1073
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:27,635
No, I've never been lucky enough
to meet someone like Maxine... or Julia.

1074
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:29,675
Ain't that the truth?

1075
00:59:29,748 --> 00:59:32,465
Used to be a time this little girl
could come by here every night.

1076
00:59:32,532 --> 00:59:34,768
- Yeah? You used to come in here?
- Sure.

1077
00:59:34,836 --> 00:59:38,219
Henry proposed to me
right over there, in that booth.

1078
00:59:38,292 --> 00:59:40,942
- Get outta here! Right over there?
- That's right.

1079
00:59:41,012 --> 00:59:43,281
- Those were the good old days, huh?
- Sure were.

1080
00:59:43,348 --> 00:59:45,715
- Couldn't squeeze a dime between 'em.
- Whew.

1081
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:48,049
She used to go on stage
and torch the place down.

1082
00:59:48,116 --> 00:59:50,799
Get outta here.

1083
00:59:50,868 --> 00:59:54,926
Now she just sings for the Lord.
Not that that's bad. [Laughs]

1084
00:59:54,996 --> 00:59:57,168
No, no, no.
That's good.

1085
00:59:57,236 --> 01:00:00,683
Let me tell you somethin'.
Ever want to know what lovin'
really sounds like...

1086
01:00:00,756 --> 01:00:03,506
- she's got that secret in her voice.
- Oh, Bristloe, please.

1087
01:00:03,572 --> 01:00:06,354
Why don't you share
that secret with us, Julia?

1088
01:00:06,419 --> 01:00:10,162
- Come on, remind us.
- No. It's been years, a long time.

1089
01:00:10,228 --> 01:00:13,261
- You still do it in B?
- No, no, Bristloe. I don't do it at all.

1090
01:00:13,332 --> 01:00:15,820
Well, I'd like to know
what love really sounds like.

1091
01:00:15,892 --> 01:00:18,347
- Well, that solves that problem.
- Bristloe.

1092
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:21,682
- I don't know the song.
- Don't want to hear another word.

1093
01:00:21,748 --> 01:00:26,090
- I don't...
- We want to hear you sing.
You sang it for Henry.

1094
01:00:26,196 --> 01:00:28,585
[Julia]
I should be going home.

1095
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:32,365
- We're going to play this in B.
Just follow me, okay?
- Okay.

1096
01:00:32,436 --> 01:00:35,884
- Follow him, guys.
- You go out there. Go on. Yeah.

1097
01:00:35,956 --> 01:00:39,022
- [Dudley Applauding]
- Go on, sing it for Henry.

Thank you very much.

01:03:36,051 --> 01:03:39,826
[Laughing]
You're bad.

1139
01:03:39,891 --> 01:03:42,608
One for you.

1140
01:03:42,675 --> 01:03:45,010
One for me.

1141
01:03:45,076 --> 01:03:47,050
And one for the tree.

1142
01:03:47,156 --> 01:03:50,931
- Thank you.
- I got your Christmas present yesterday.

1143
01:03:50,996 --> 01:03:53,003
You did?
What'd you get?

1144
01:03:53,076 --> 01:03:55,945
I can't tell you.
It's a secret.

1145
01:03:56,019 --> 01:03:58,288
What are you getting Mom for Christmas?

1146
01:03:58,356 --> 01:04:00,777
I don't know.
What do you think I should get her?

1147
01:04:00,852 --> 01:04:03,787
I think she'd like to go to bed.

1148
01:04:05,236 --> 01:04:07,570
Excuse me, young man?

1149
01:04:07,635 --> 01:04:11,247
She was looking at a nightie
in the store window with Dudley.

1150
01:04:11,316 --> 01:04:13,171
Was she now?

1151
01:04:13,236 --> 01:04:15,341
All right, come on, young man.
Sleep time.

1152
01:04:15,411 --> 01:04:18,378
Wait for your mama to get home,
you'll be too big for the bed.

1153
01:04:18,451 --> 01:04:22,379
Go get some more Vicks on your chest.
See if we can rid of that stuffy nose.

1154
01:04:22,451 --> 01:04:25,102
I think you were born
with a stuffy nose. Come on, here.

1155
01:04:25,171 --> 01:04:28,139
- [Jeremiah] Good night, Daddy.
- Good night, son.

1156
01:04:32,532 --> 01:04:35,347
[Laughing]
Oh, thank you.

1157
01:04:35,412 --> 01:04:38,161
- [Driver] Have a good evening.
- Thank you.

1158
01:04:38,228 --> 01:04:41,708
- Did you have a good time?
- Are you kidding?
I had a great time. You?

1159
01:04:41,780 --> 01:04:44,529
I had a ball.
You're not such a bad dancer.

1160
01:04:44,596 --> 01:04:47,410
- I haven't had so much fun
in a long time.
- I did too.

1161
01:04:47,476 --> 01:04:50,225
- I heard you singing.
- Yeah, I was about to get
up there with you.

1162
01:04:50,291 --> 01:04:53,008
- I'm so glad you didn't.
- % I believe in miracles%

1163
01:04:53,075 --> 01:04:56,392
- Shh! They're probably all asleep.
- Not all of us.

1164
01:04:56,468 --> 01:04:59,021
- Henry.
- Dudley.

1165
01:04:59,092 --> 01:05:02,703
I guess I don't have to ask
if you had a... good time.

1166
01:05:02,803 --> 01:05:05,105
We did. We went to Jazzies.

1167
01:05:05,172 --> 01:05:08,467
Some of the old band
was there, and...

1168
01:05:08,531 --> 01:05:11,314
You've been at Jazzie's?

1169
01:05:11,380 --> 01:05:14,576
Yeah. Yeah.
Bristloe was there too.

1170
01:05:14,643 --> 01:05:17,513
- Henry, your wife got on stage.
- Oh, wait, wait.

1171
01:05:17,588 --> 01:05:19,530
You went singing
at Jazzie's all night?

1172
01:05:19,603 --> 01:05:23,280
- You told me to take her out.
- Not to the place where I proposed!

1173
01:05:23,348 --> 01:05:27,625
Henry, we had fun.
Remember what that used to be?

1174
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:30,220
But honey. Jazzie's?

1175
01:05:32,019 --> 01:05:38,314
Well, maybe I sang at Jazzies because
I won't be singing in any Joe Hamilton
church, wherever that may be.

1176
01:05:38,387 --> 01:05:41,965
- Thanks, Dudley.
- Good night, Julia.

1177
01:05:45,844 --> 01:05:48,233
- She had a good time, Henry.
- Oh, really?

1178
01:05:48,308 --> 01:05:51,603
Yeah. Yeah.
She told me about how you proposed.

1179
01:05:51,667 --> 01:05:54,569
- She showed me the booth.
- The booth?

1180
01:05:54,643 --> 01:05:57,774
I don't believe
this entire situation!

1181
01:05:57,843 --> 01:06:01,618
No, you don't.
That's your trouble right there.

1182
01:06:01,683 --> 01:06:05,196
You don't believe in much of anything
anymore, do you, Henry?

1183
01:06:05,267 --> 01:06:08,464
You don't believe in me.
You don't believe in yourself.

1184
01:06:08,532 --> 01:06:11,020
You don't believe you can
make a difference anymore.

1185
01:06:11,091 --> 01:06:13,994
You don't even believe
that Billy Eldridge is innocent.

1186
01:06:14,067 --> 01:06:16,882
Billy... Of course I do.

1187
01:06:16,947 --> 01:06:18,802
You don't sound
very convincing, Henry.

1188
01:06:18,867 --> 01:06:20,809
I tried to help him before.

1189
01:06:20,883 --> 01:06:22,509
- Did you?
- Yes.

1190
01:06:22,580 --> 01:06:25,613
And besides,
he doesn't even go to church.

1191
01:06:25,683 --> 01:06:29,840
Have you tried looking him in the eye
and asking him to tell the truth?

1192
01:06:29,908 --> 01:06:31,850
No. You know why?

1193
01:06:31,924 --> 01:06:35,371
I guess I was just
too busy having fun.

1194
01:06:35,443 --> 01:06:38,891
I guess that's your problem, Henry.
You're just too busy.

1195
01:06:38,963 --> 01:06:42,541
Your wife feels like
she's in a marriage by herself.

1196
01:06:42,611 --> 01:06:46,321
Your son lost his best friend.
What are you doing about that, Henry?

1197
01:06:46,387 --> 01:06:49,137
You don't have to listen to me.
You're right.

1198
01:06:49,204 --> 01:06:51,538
But you ought to listen to them.

1199
01:06:51,732 --> 01:06:56,303
[Grandmother] Come on, everybody.
Time to make the Christmas baskets.

1200
01:07:00,691 --> 01:07:02,698
Aren't you gonna help?

1201
01:07:02,771 --> 01:07:04,626
I miss Hakim.

1202
01:07:07,731 --> 01:07:09,739
I know.

1203
01:07:09,812 --> 01:07:13,357
But a lot of people
are depending on us for those baskets.

1204
01:07:13,427 --> 01:07:15,696
- What do you think?
- Okay, then.

1205
01:07:15,763 --> 01:07:17,673
All right?

1206
01:07:20,083 --> 01:07:25,266
Gym socks. Now, nothing says
"Merry Christmas" like gym socks.

1207
01:07:25,332 --> 01:07:28,365
[Chattering]

1208
01:07:30,867 --> 01:07:32,689
Ahh.

1209
01:07:34,867 --> 01:07:36,722
Uh, Billy.

1210
01:07:36,787 --> 01:07:39,504
Uh... here.

1211
01:07:39,572 --> 01:07:42,354
Thank you.
[Sighs]

1212
01:07:42,419 --> 01:07:45,102
Billy, I need
to talk to you.

1213
01:07:45,171 --> 01:07:47,538
You're wasting your time,
you know that?

1214
01:07:47,603 --> 01:07:50,287
The grand jury's
about to indict me in there.

1215
01:07:52,403 --> 01:07:55,186
You ever pray, son?

1216
01:07:55,251 --> 01:07:57,390
Oh, yeah. Yeah, right.

1217

You're too hip for that.
All right. Okay.

- You play ball?
- Yeah.

1219
01:08:04,948 --> 01:08:08,243
When you play basketball, don't you
hope that when you shoot the ball...

1220
01:08:08,307 --> 01:08:10,315
that the ball goes into the net?

1221
01:08:10,387 --> 01:08:12,624
Yeah.

1222
01:08:12,691 --> 01:08:15,309
Well, that's all prayer is: Hope.

1223
01:08:15,379 --> 01:08:19,274
And helping to give people hope
is what I do.

No one believes me anyway.

Look at me, son.

1227

Were you a part of this or not?

1228
01:08:35,187 --> 01:08:38,570
I swear, Rev,
it happened just like I said.

1229
01:08:38,644 --> 01:08:41,458
I've messed up before,
but I'm telling you the truth.

1230
01:09:00,563 --> 01:09:03,859
When was the last time
you said a prayer, Billy?

1231
01:09:03,923 --> 01:09:06,574
I don't know.

1232
01:09:06,643 --> 01:09:11,051
Well, I think it's about
time you gave it a try.

1233

- Good morning, Judge!
Beautiful day, isn't it?

1234
01:09:14,643 --> 01:09:17,458
Reverend Biggs,
this is not a playground!

1235
01:09:17,523 --> 01:09:20,174
It's a court of law!
I don't have time...

1236
01:09:20,243 --> 01:09:24,334
I work for an even higher court,
Your Honor, and I'm finding the time.

1237
01:09:24,403 --> 01:09:27,469

Billy Eldridge is innocent.
- I have your word on that?

- What does it take for me to show you?
- Let him in.

1239
01:09:30,388 --> 01:09:34,479
On his way to return a video,
he got $20 from an auto-teller.
There's a time on the receipt.

1240
01:09:34,547 --> 01:09:38,093
- [Gasps]
- The victim identified him, Reverend.
The victim...

1241
01:09:38,164 --> 01:09:42,419
Saw him standing there, Your Honor,
and that's all Billy was doing.

1242
01:09:42,483 --> 01:09:45,778
There's a grand jury hearing
going on right down the hall...

1243
01:09:45,844 --> 01:09:49,520
but the D.A. Won't even present it
if you don't buy the evidence.

1244
01:09:49,588 --> 01:09:52,817
- And you know there isn't any.
- Reverend, come here. Come here.

1245
01:09:52,883 --> 01:09:55,272
I appreciate you
wanting to help the boy.

1246
01:09:55,348 --> 01:09:57,933
The young man, Your Honor,
helped himself.

1247
01:09:58,003 --> 01:10:02,378
He shows up every day to his $4.25
an hour job at Sampson's Stationery...

1248
01:10:02,451 --> 01:10:04,458
a job he's held steady for two years...

1249
01:10:04,531 --> 01:10:06,866
and he goes to school at night.

1250
01:10:06,931 --> 01:10:10,247
He came to a crossroads
a long time ago, Your Honor.

1251
01:10:10,323 --> 01:10:13,192
And he chose the right path.
Now it's up to you...

1252
01:10:13,267 --> 01:10:15,853
to judge not his past,
but his future;

1253
01:10:15,923 --> 01:10:18,672
not his failures, but his dreams;

1254
01:10:18,740 --> 01:10:22,896
not his imperfections,
but his possibilities.

I'm sorry, Jer.
I really am.

was so bad. We'll go tomorrow, okay?

You did? Good for you.

And I got Billy Eldridge
home for Christmas.

1394
01:17:24,723 --> 01:17:27,538
They dropped the charges, Henry.
How'd you do it?

1395
01:17:27,603 --> 01:17:32,011
I just remembered you gotta look someone
in the eye to see if they're innocent.

So it wasn't that hard.

Dudley and Mom.
It was fun!

Dudley went skating
with you?

- You take her to lunch.
- Well, you were late, Henry.

- You take her to Jazzies.

You take her skating.

I promise you.

a married woman look at a man that way.

And you know the most precious time
of all is time spent with your family.

Now, you know I'm supposed
to only be here through Christmas.

have a hip injury...

she's wonderful. She deserves...

deserves and what she don't?

She's Henry's wife.

Don't worry. L...

1468
01:21:38,963 --> 01:21:42,792
I'm sure she'll forget me
as soon as I leave.

1469
01:21:42,867 --> 01:21:46,031

- I may be a lot of things,
but jealous is not one of them.

1513
01:24:37,587 --> 01:24:40,718
Sure, you are. You're so jealous,
you can't even think straight.

1514
01:24:40,786 --> 01:24:43,055
I am thinking just fine, thank you.

1515

where the Keeleys live.
- The Keeleys' house is on Sixth.

1516
01:24:46,866 --> 01:24:49,419

- What?

- Mm-hmm. There's the house.

- Be careful, Henry.
- I will be.

1522
01:25:06,450 --> 01:25:09,745
Drive all this way,
they're probably not even home.

1523
01:25:11,730 --> 01:25:14,578
At least they could
shovel their walkway.

Forever is right.
Do you remember the first time?

- My mother was visiting, yeah.
- Yes.

01:26:25,138 --> 01:26:28,651
- You know, Henry, she never liked me.
- No, no, that's not true.

1547
01:26:28,722 --> 01:26:33,229
She used to say, "Girl, you better
get some meat on them there bones."

1548
01:26:33,298 --> 01:26:35,599
Well, she just wanted
you to eat, that's all.

1549
01:26:35,667 --> 01:26:38,798
- No, she wanted me to be as fat as her.
- She wasn't that fat.

Henry, a policeman walk down the street,

You know, I miss this Henry.

Henry, do you know why I am
a trustee of a church I don't go to?

1613
01:30:47,089 --> 01:30:51,977
Because your deacons
all came begging to me,
telling me how broke the church was.

1614
01:30:52,049 --> 01:30:55,147
I bought the mortgage.
That's right!

that neighborhood around,
attract some real money to that place.

- You see what I'm saying?

1620
01:31:13,169 --> 01:31:17,097
You think without me there to lead them,
the people will just cave in.

1621
01:31:17,169 --> 01:31:20,202
- That's why you got me here!
- No, Henry, I want you to lead them.

1622
01:31:20,272 --> 01:31:24,745
- But into the future.
- Whose future, Joe?
They don't play much tennis.

1623
01:31:29,041 --> 01:31:32,653
Joe, come back to the church.
See exactly who you'll be hurting.

1624
01:31:32,721 --> 01:31:36,812
See their faces, their families, their...
their children, Joe.

than you think, Henry.

Come on, they'll survive.

- Call me.
- I will.

1966
01:53:30,447 --> 01:53:32,619
[Julia]
Henry, you did it!

1967
01:53:32,688 --> 01:53:34,859
[Henry]
No, honey, we did.

1968
01:53:34,927 --> 01:53:38,026
- [Dudley] Good sermon, Reverend.
- Merry Christmas.

1969
01:53:38,096 --> 01:53:40,681
[Clears Throat]
Merry Christmas.

1970
01:53:40,751 --> 01:53:43,369
- Who's that?
- I don't know.
Maybe he's new in the neighborhood.

1971
01:53:43,439 --> 01:53:46,571
Come on, boys!
Let's go!

1972
01:53:46,639 --> 01:53:48,908
Hey, Merry Christmas, Dudley.

1973
01:53:48,975 --> 01:53:51,561
Merry Christmas to you, too, Jeremiah.

1974
01:53:51,632 --> 01:53:53,933
[Julia]
Lunch and presents. Come on, boys!

1975
01:53:53,999 --> 01:53:55,854
Jeremiah, give me your hand, honey.

1976
01:53:55,919 --> 01:53:57,807
Mom, did you get Dudley a present?

1977
01:53:57,871 --> 01:53:59,726
Jeremiah, who is Dudley, baby?

1978
01:53:59,791 --> 01:54:04,330
- Ma, you know Dudley.
- Come on, boys, let's go get some soup.

1979
01:54:04,399 --> 01:54:08,425
[Jeremiah Narrating] That was
a long time ago. At least a year.

1980
01:54:08,495 --> 01:54:11,114
Before Hakim came
to live with us for good.

1981
01:54:11,215 --> 01:54:12,939
Wow!

1982
01:54:13,008 --> 01:54:15,528
And became my real brother.

1983
01:54:15,599 --> 01:54:17,454
[Marguerite]
It's beautiful!

1984
01:54:17,519 --> 01:54:19,526
[Henry] You must've sat up
with that all night, baby.

1985
01:54:19,599 --> 01:54:21,704
- [Julia] Mama, you didn't.
- [Marguerite] With my back?

1986
01:54:21,775 --> 01:54:24,809
[Jeremiah Narrating]
My parents still think I made Dudley up.

1987
01:54:24,880 --> 01:54:28,109
They say,
"If he's so real, then where is he?"

1988
01:54:28,175 --> 01:54:31,404
But just like I told Daddy...

1989
01:54:31,471 --> 01:54:33,959
just because you can't see the air...

1990
01:54:34,032 --> 01:54:36,333
doesn't stop you from breathing.

1991
01:54:36,400 --> 01:54:38,855
And just 'cause you can't see God...

1992
01:54:38,928 --> 01:54:41,317
it don't stop you from believing.

1993
01:54:41,391 --> 01:54:43,847
Then Daddy smiled and said...

1994
01:54:43,919 --> 01:54:47,335
"Son, that's what we call faith."
