1
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:59,996
My God.

2
00:03:01,373 --> 00:03:03,769
There's an awning on the new store.

3
00:03:04,511 --> 00:03:07,502
There's still soap on all the windows.

4
00:03:09,347 --> 00:03:10,367
So?

5
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:14,779
They're hiding something.

6
00:03:16,582 --> 00:03:18,554
I don't think so, Nettie.

7
00:03:19,023 --> 00:03:22,723
I think it's just going to be
some kind of antique store is all.

8
00:03:23,725 --> 00:03:26,351
I'm never going over there.

9
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:35,640
Hey, Raider. How are you, buddy?
Good to see you.

10
00:03:37,777 --> 00:03:40,040
- Hi, Nettie.
- Hi.

11
00:03:40,571 --> 00:03:43,907
- Is Polly around?
- Gosh, yes. It's lunchtime.

12
00:03:53,321 --> 00:03:54,345
Hi.

13
00:03:57,022 --> 00:03:59,223
- Morning, Frank, Father Meehan.
- Hi, Alan.

14
00:03:59,295 --> 00:04:00,348
Good afternoon.

15
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:03,256
- Smoked turkey on rye?
- Not today.

16
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,633
Think I'll try one of your specials today.

17
00:04:05,706 --> 00:04:08,897
So I'll have... What's that? I'll have that.
Delicious salami...

18
00:04:08,969 --> 00:04:13,140
...provolone, lettuce, tomato, mayo,
and two kinds of mustard in a pita pocket.

19
00:04:13,214 --> 00:04:14,297
I wouldn't.

20
00:04:14,578 --> 00:04:17,946
Okay, how about smoked turkey on rye?

21
00:04:18,247 --> 00:04:19,269
Good order.

22
00:04:19,947 --> 00:04:23,012
- Smoked turkey, rye!
- And a big piece of Nettie's apple pie.

23
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:28,862
So how's your day so far?

24
00:04:30,155 --> 00:04:33,751
A little crazy, actually.
Did I tell you I got the photos back...

25
00:04:33,866 --> 00:04:36,054
"You won't believe your eyes.

26
00:04:36,565 --> 00:04:38,160
"Needful things.

27
00:04:38,567 --> 00:04:40,360
"A new kind of store.

28
00:04:40,631 --> 00:04:42,832
"You won't believe your eyes. "

29
00:04:43,478 --> 00:04:45,104
It says so right there.

30
00:04:45,939 --> 00:04:48,034
Then it must be true.

31
00:04:48,545 --> 00:04:50,140
So, who's the new owner?

32
00:04:50,213 --> 00:04:53,006
Nobody knows.
Not from around here is all.

33
00:05:26,045 --> 00:05:28,534
Aren't you supposed to be in school?

34
00:05:29,015 --> 00:05:30,380
Got a cold.

35
00:06:35,123 --> 00:06:36,281
Hello?

36
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:24,696
- Is anyone here?
- I'm here.

37
00:07:27,104 --> 00:07:30,231
The door was unlocked. I didn't bust in.

38
00:07:32,347 --> 00:07:35,172
Of course it's unlocked. I'm open.

39
00:07:36,882 --> 00:07:38,853
You've been here before.

40
00:07:43,961 --> 00:07:46,786
- No.
- Sure you have.

41
00:07:47,256 --> 00:07:49,350
I never forget a face.

42
00:07:51,061 --> 00:07:52,457
Who are you?

43
00:07:53,502 --> 00:07:57,024
My name is Leland Gaunt. And you are?

44
00:07:58,035 --> 00:07:59,871
Brian Rusk.

45
00:08:00,538 --> 00:08:01,977
Nice meeting you, sir.

46
00:08:02,372 --> 00:08:05,813
I'm equally pleased
to make your acquaintance, Master Brian.

47
00:08:06,647 --> 00:08:08,637
Now, what would you fancy?

48
00:08:08,815 --> 00:08:11,108
- Fancy?
- What would you like?

49
00:08:11,182 --> 00:08:15,415
Everything that's here is for sale,
but not everything that's for sale is here.

50
00:08:15,518 --> 00:08:17,281
I have a basement, you see.

51
00:08:17,896 --> 00:08:20,377
Are you from overseas somewhere?

52
00:08:21,325 --> 00:08:22,846
I'm from Akron.

53
00:08:24,025 --> 00:08:27,361
- Where's that? England?
- That's in Ohio.

54
00:08:28,936 --> 00:08:30,729
What do you know?

55
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:33,836
There's Wilma Jerzyk
and her husband Pete.

56
00:08:34,608 --> 00:08:37,005
What do you suppose they're up to?

57
00:08:38,111 --> 00:08:40,476
Buying feed for their turkey farm?

58
00:08:41,383 --> 00:08:43,042
Roast turkey?

59
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,241
No, she's a crazy person.

60
00:08:48,358 --> 00:08:50,683
Now, what'll it be? A Walkman!

61
00:08:51,058 --> 00:08:54,051
- A mountain bike.
- I already got one.

62
00:08:54,896 --> 00:08:58,053
- Air Jordans.
- I don't know.

63
00:08:58,168 --> 00:09:00,597
- Sure, yeah, I guess.
- Of course not.

64
00:09:00,701 --> 00:09:04,862
Those are just objects, aren't they?
Just things. Nothing really important.

65
00:09:05,769 --> 00:09:08,469
Suppose you had one wish, Brian.

66
00:09:09,147 --> 00:09:10,867
What would you say?

67
00:09:11,315 --> 00:09:14,765
- A wish?
- One wish. Just one. To make you happy.

68
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:19,749
What would make you happy again?
Let's see, where do we start?

69
00:09:20,582 --> 00:09:24,117
- What could I possibly have around here...
- Mickey Mantle?

70
00:09:24,555 --> 00:09:28,548
- Little before your time, wasn't he?
- Yeah. I meant the baseball card.

71
00:09:28,631 --> 00:09:31,030
I mean, me and my dad,
we used to collect them.

72
00:09:31,467 --> 00:09:33,020
Topps or Fleers?

73
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:36,565
Topps. We had a whole collection
of 56 baseball cards.

74
00:09:36,804 --> 00:09:39,901
Al Kaline, Whitey Ford, Roy Campanella,
guys of that caliber?

75
00:09:40,005 --> 00:09:42,568
We have every Yankee
except Mickey Mantle.

76
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:46,741
I mean, Moose Skowron was over $65.

77
00:09:48,378 --> 00:09:50,514
Skowron is one thing.

78
00:09:51,316 --> 00:09:55,446
Mickey Mantle.
That's got to run $600, $700.

79
00:09:57,531 --> 00:09:58,584
You asked me.

80
00:09:59,261 --> 00:10:02,627
I believe I might have something
that'll make you very happy, Brian.

81
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,286
Stay right here.

82
00:10:08,267 --> 00:10:10,363
My God. Look at my butt.

83
00:10:14,044 --> 00:10:16,369
- I look awful.
- No, you look fabulous.

84
00:10:16,911 --> 00:10:18,902
Pol, you know how...

85
00:10:19,476 --> 00:10:22,969
...you're always saying
that I'm not all that serious about us?

86
00:10:23,052 --> 00:10:26,106
This is your camera, right?
I don't look like this.

87
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:29,515
- I'll commit suicide if I look like this.
- Polly, I...

88
00:10:30,661 --> 00:10:31,788
Will you marry me?

89
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,833
Sure, whenever you're serious about it.
I gotta check Nettie.

90
00:10:34,896 --> 00:10:38,857
Make sure she doesn't burn the French
fries again and put me in the poor house.

91
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:39,994
Polly...

92
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:42,838
I am serious.

93
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,302
Mickey Mantle!

94
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,711
"Topps, 1956."

95
00:10:53,014 --> 00:10:56,475
Signed, "To my good friend Brian. "

96
00:10:57,257 --> 00:10:59,811
Wait a minute. Brian is my name.
That's impossible.

97
00:10:59,885 --> 00:11:02,721
"Best wishes, Mickey Mantle. "
Now, close your eyes, Brian.

98
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:04,513
Close your eyes.

99
00:11:20,245 --> 00:11:24,572
Now, then. How much would you pay
for this card, Brian?

100
00:11:28,815 --> 00:11:32,016
Mickey Mantle. Topps, 1956.

101
00:11:32,557 --> 00:11:35,529
Signed, "To my good friend Brian. "

102
00:11:39,656 --> 00:11:42,598
No, listen, all I got here...

103
00:11:43,504 --> 00:11:46,132
The buyer must never tell
the seller how much he has.

104
00:11:46,204 --> 00:11:48,831
If you can't tell a lie, then be still.

105
00:11:49,239 --> 00:11:52,074
The first rule of fair trade, Master Brian.

106
00:11:53,606 --> 00:11:57,337
- So what do you think?
- I can't breathe yet.

107
00:11:58,245 --> 00:12:01,268
It's not as great as it looks.
I got it off the TV.

108
00:12:02,081 --> 00:12:03,480
Such a liar.

109
00:12:04,386 --> 00:12:06,982
- Put it on?
- Yeah.

110
00:12:22,901 --> 00:12:24,633
Does that mean yes?

111
00:12:29,176 --> 00:12:31,303
- Yeah. Yeah?
- Yes.

112
00:12:42,792 --> 00:12:43,815
No.

113
00:12:49,266 --> 00:12:52,198
95 cents!

114
00:12:54,303 --> 00:12:56,701
Now we're getting somewhere.

115
00:12:58,076 --> 00:13:02,736
Not quite enough, okay?
But an intriguing offer nonetheless.

116
00:13:03,445 --> 00:13:05,039
Let's call it...

117
00:13:05,582 --> 00:13:07,678
...half the price, shall we?

118
00:13:07,854 --> 00:13:11,222
Yes. Half the price is 95 cents.

119
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:14,090
The price you paid cash.

120
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:16,592
The rest...

121
00:13:17,331 --> 00:13:21,783
...the other half is a deed.
You understand?

122
00:13:23,473 --> 00:13:27,737
- A deed?
- A trick. More like a tiny prank.

123
00:13:27,809 --> 00:13:31,968
No big deal.
And no one's ever going to suspect you.

124
00:13:32,271 --> 00:13:33,365
I promise.

125
00:13:34,377 --> 00:13:39,214
Do you remember that lady we peeked at
buying feed across the street?

126
00:13:39,651 --> 00:13:43,144
Yeah, Wilma Jerzyk. The turkey farmer.

127
00:13:43,885 --> 00:13:45,856
You know where she lives?

128
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:45,480
Out of the car.

129
00:14:46,158 --> 00:14:48,177
I said, "Get out of the car. "

130
00:14:51,995 --> 00:14:53,286
Now.

131
00:14:55,257 --> 00:14:59,667
Is this your name on this goddamn ticket,
Ridgewick, or is it a forgery?

132
00:14:59,761 --> 00:15:01,961
- You're parked in the crip space.
- The what?

133
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:04,025
- You can't come in here...
- The what?

134
00:15:04,108 --> 00:15:07,330
The handicapped space.
We've told you about it before, Buster...

135
00:15:07,402 --> 00:15:10,029
What did you call me?
Did you call me Buster?

136
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:13,012
Touch me again, I'll throw you in the cell!
I mean it!

137
00:15:13,073 --> 00:15:16,378
It's Danforth! Danforth Keeton III...

138
00:15:16,453 --> 00:15:19,277
...who is Head Selectman
of this piss pot little town.

139
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:23,415
I could get you fired off the force in two...
Make that one second flat.

140
00:15:23,488 --> 00:15:27,294
- Am I getting through to you, Norris?
- I told him to write the ticket.

141
00:15:27,357 --> 00:15:29,452
In that case, my mistake.

142
00:15:29,526 --> 00:15:32,224
Jesus, Dan,
what in hell's got into you today?

143
00:15:32,297 --> 00:15:36,198
Nothing got into me! I'm just sick
and tired of self-important little pricks.

144
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,460
- Pusillanimous assholes...
- That's enough!

145
00:15:38,607 --> 00:15:42,066
I try to do a lot for this town.
I accomplish a lot for this town.

146
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:46,206
In fact, I am this town. And I am sick
and tired of this goddamn persecution.

147
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:49,375
- I am not persecuting you, Danforth.
- He called me Buster!

148
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:52,649
- You know how I feel about that.
- Then he'll apologize.

149
00:15:53,284 --> 00:15:54,619
Won't you, Norris?

150
00:15:54,985 --> 00:15:57,153
- Don't know that I will.
- You will.

151
00:15:57,528 --> 00:15:58,580
Now.

152
00:16:02,198 --> 00:16:03,283
I'm sorry.

153
00:16:04,262 --> 00:16:08,286
- I'm sorry that I called you Buster.
- Yeah, you mama's boy. You candy-assed...

154
00:16:08,371 --> 00:16:11,894
Shut up, you bloated,
cigar-sucking used car salesman.

155
00:16:11,967 --> 00:16:13,801
Boats, shithead!

156
00:16:14,136 --> 00:16:17,598
I sell quality preowned yachts,
you miserable fucking scuzz bucket...

157
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:20,473
Shut up! Shut up!

158
00:16:21,349 --> 00:16:24,979
When I moved here, I thought,
"Great, I'm out of the big city. "

159
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:28,992
I'm in a place where people won't be
crawling up each other's asshole every day.

160
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:32,681
Where maybe my biggest nightmare
was gonna be getting a cat out of a tree.

161
00:16:32,754 --> 00:16:36,695
But forget that!
Everybody is insane everywhere!

162
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:39,259
So you guys just fight it out between you.

163
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:42,826
One of you kill each other,
and who's ever left, I'll throw in jail.

164
00:16:45,506 --> 00:16:48,871
You can do it. I know you can.
He's not gonna bite.

165
00:16:50,206 --> 00:16:54,012
But what will I say?

166
00:16:54,647 --> 00:16:57,777
You introduce yourself. "Hi. I'm Nettie. "

167
00:16:58,422 --> 00:16:59,746
Then what?

168
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,884
Nettie, just go. You'll be fine.

169
00:17:05,262 --> 00:17:06,419
Go on.

170
00:17:10,233 --> 00:17:11,693
Hi. I'm Nettie.

171
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:25,403
Thank you.

172
00:17:26,144 --> 00:17:29,176
It's only 19th century. I'm sorry.

173
00:17:30,447 --> 00:17:32,210
Enjoy your purchases.

174
00:17:37,058 --> 00:17:39,154
What's this? Some old wood chisel?

175
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:42,657
It belonged to a cabinet maker
at Château de Versailles...

176
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,387
...in the days of Louis XVI.

177
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:50,172
Look at this, Pete. Looks pretty old.

178
00:17:50,371 --> 00:17:51,737
Yep.

179
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:58,941
My God. I didn't think we had room
for another soul in here.

180
00:17:59,118 --> 00:18:01,109
Hi. My name is Nettie.

181
00:18:05,321 --> 00:18:07,615
That stupid dog barks at me once more...

182
00:18:07,688 --> 00:18:10,523
...I won't bother complaining
to Sheriff Pangborn again.

183
00:18:10,596 --> 00:18:15,393
- I'll come over your place, skin him alive.
- No, not in here. Dear God, please!

184
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:21,794
- Throw her Baptist ass in the street.
- I will not.

185
00:18:21,866 --> 00:18:24,806
Dear ladies, let's all be friends.
Can't we all be friends?

186
00:18:24,972 --> 00:18:26,400
Not in this life.

187
00:18:27,747 --> 00:18:29,541
Please, not in my place.

188
00:18:29,747 --> 00:18:31,771
I'm sorry. Ladies, excuse me!

189
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,648
Miss Jerzyk!

190
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:05,205
Pick it up. Go ahead. Go on.

191
00:19:05,715 --> 00:19:07,738
Don't be afraid, Miss Cobb.

192
00:19:10,989 --> 00:19:15,858
No. I had one just like it years ago.
But it got broke.

193
00:19:17,162 --> 00:19:19,654
- My husband...
- Your husband?

194
00:19:19,893 --> 00:19:21,489
Then it's Mrs. Cobb.

195
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:25,888
Although my George has been passed on
for some time now.

196
00:19:26,597 --> 00:19:30,371
- He died, untimely.
- I'm so sorry to hear that.

197
00:19:32,007 --> 00:19:34,844
No need to be sorry.
It's been seven years since he was...

198
00:19:34,906 --> 00:19:36,813
Murder is awful.

199
00:19:38,587 --> 00:19:42,016
- I didn't mean to.
- Of course not.

200
00:19:42,484 --> 00:19:45,218
It wasn't you who took that meat fork
from the drawer...

201
00:19:45,289 --> 00:19:49,189
...and stuck it in his throat.
Are you leaving, Mrs. Roberts?

202
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:53,256
I'll have to think about it.
It is a lot of money.

203
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,351
You think about it. So will I.

204
00:20:03,304 --> 00:20:04,899
You baked this?

205
00:20:07,914 --> 00:20:09,143
Of course.

206
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:14,408
Homemade every day from apples
picked down at the Mayflowers'.

207
00:20:14,689 --> 00:20:17,275
Polly Chalmers, my boss, sent it over.

208
00:20:21,956 --> 00:20:24,655
Go ahead. Take him.

209
00:20:28,035 --> 00:20:31,933
- I'm scared I'll drop it again.
- You won't drop it.

210
00:20:33,235 --> 00:20:34,833
Come, Mrs. Cobb.

211
00:20:36,573 --> 00:20:38,198
Please, sit down.

212
00:20:45,017 --> 00:20:46,205
Listen.

213
00:20:47,884 --> 00:20:51,187
Sometimes I think I can hear
the tiniest laugh.

214
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,527
I like you, Netitia.

215
00:21:01,102 --> 00:21:03,427
I won't yell at you, like George did.

216
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:08,067
You moron!

217
00:21:10,539 --> 00:21:11,664
No!

218
00:21:27,187 --> 00:21:29,680
I think it should be yours, Netitia.

219
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:35,693
I need to go to work.

220
00:21:37,832 --> 00:21:41,272
I'll see you soon. I'll drop by for a bite.

221
00:21:42,471 --> 00:21:45,671
Mr. Keeton eats there most every day,
does he not?

222
00:21:46,974 --> 00:21:49,569
Yeah. Danforth Keeton.

223
00:21:50,748 --> 00:21:53,812
And everybody calls him Buster
behind his back.

224
00:21:54,648 --> 00:21:57,483
Why is that? Pray tell.

225
00:21:59,923 --> 00:22:01,516
I don't know.

226
00:22:02,331 --> 00:22:05,520
Maybe someone should play
a trick on Buster.

227
00:22:05,895 --> 00:22:07,689
Teach him to be nice.

228
00:22:10,431 --> 00:22:13,058
My husband played a lot of tricks on me.

229
00:22:13,236 --> 00:22:16,176
Maybe it would be fun
to play one on someone else.

230
00:22:16,342 --> 00:22:19,638
Nobody would ever know it was you,
I promise.

231
00:23:22,106 --> 00:23:23,628
Welcome to Needful Things.

232
00:23:26,682 --> 00:23:28,111
Alan Pangborn.

233
00:23:28,613 --> 00:23:32,146
- The sheriff around these parts.
- Leland Gaunt. Owner.

234
00:23:33,989 --> 00:23:36,576
- So, what can I sell you, Sheriff?
- Me?

235
00:23:37,587 --> 00:23:40,954
Nothing. I got everything I need, thanks.

236
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,124
Fair enough.

237
00:23:45,469 --> 00:23:50,130
How about a piece of pie?
Your fiancée Ms. Chalmers sent it over.

238
00:23:51,536 --> 00:23:53,902
- My fiancée?
- Such a pretty lady.

239
00:23:54,277 --> 00:23:57,510
You're a lucky man, Sheriff. I'll be back.

240
00:24:15,066 --> 00:24:19,497
Goodness.
I wish I had some cheddar cheese.

241
00:24:20,435 --> 00:24:23,897
But beggars can't be choosers, can they?

242
00:24:25,044 --> 00:24:28,629
Certain we haven't met somewhere before,
have we?

243
00:24:29,943 --> 00:24:31,570
What, you and me?

244
00:24:32,311 --> 00:24:33,801
In a big city.

245
00:24:35,114 --> 00:24:36,981
You look familiar, Al.

246
00:24:38,451 --> 00:24:40,974
You look out of place here, actually.

247
00:24:43,589 --> 00:24:46,854
You don't mind my saying so,
so do you, Leland.

248
00:24:49,792 --> 00:24:51,701
So, where are you from?

249
00:24:54,098 --> 00:24:55,194
Ohio.

250
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:57,863
Akron, to be precise.

251
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,604
Pittsburgh.

252
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:03,304
I'm from Pittsburgh.

253
00:25:04,607 --> 00:25:06,473
So, why did you leave?

254
00:25:07,777 --> 00:25:12,218
I was a cop there,
and I got tired of all the shit going down.

255
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,982
And one day I just lost it.

256
00:25:17,921 --> 00:25:19,451
I hit this guy.

257
00:25:22,529 --> 00:25:23,998
Way too hard.

258
00:25:25,364 --> 00:25:27,668
I reckon he needed some killing.

259
00:25:32,703 --> 00:25:36,509
But it was still wrong.

260
00:25:36,873 --> 00:25:38,364
Of course it was.

261
00:25:42,285 --> 00:25:44,683
Yeah. So I left, and now I'm here.

262
00:25:50,626 --> 00:25:51,855
So am I.

263
00:26:29,302 --> 00:26:31,231
- Reverend.
- Sheriff.

264
00:26:32,671 --> 00:26:35,933
- Alan, thanks for coming!
- Afternoon, Father.

265
00:26:36,308 --> 00:26:40,364
- Hi, Sheriff.
- I got this in the mail this morning.

266
00:26:41,407 --> 00:26:43,814
"Listen up, you mackerel snapper. "

267
00:26:46,046 --> 00:26:48,881
- Excuse me.
- "We've tried to reason with you...

268
00:26:48,954 --> 00:26:53,322
"... but it's been no use.
We have put up with your Popish idolatry...

269
00:26:53,459 --> 00:26:57,618
"... and even with your licentious worship
of the Babylon whore...

270
00:26:57,795 --> 00:26:59,850
"... but now you've gone too far. "

271
00:26:59,995 --> 00:27:02,467
"Babylon whore. "
I mean, saints preserve us.

272
00:27:03,029 --> 00:27:07,199
"Heed our warning.
Give up your plan to turn this town...

273
00:27:07,272 --> 00:27:11,535
"... into a den of thieves and gamblers,
or you will smell the brimstone.

274
00:27:11,942 --> 00:27:15,935
"'The wicked shall be turned into hell. '
Psalms 9:17.

275
00:27:16,114 --> 00:27:18,907
"The concerned Baptist men
of Castle Rock. "

276
00:27:19,345 --> 00:27:21,314
It's that idiot, Reverend Willie Rose.

277
00:27:21,388 --> 00:27:23,911
Maybe you shouldn't have
called it "Casino Night. "

278
00:27:23,984 --> 00:27:27,477
For God's sake, Alan.
It's only a little charity gambling.

279
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:30,114
I mean, I don't know why
it upsets the Baptists so.

280
00:27:30,197 --> 00:27:31,855
I'll go talk to Rever...

281
00:27:31,928 --> 00:27:34,629
When I was younger,
people got along better!

282
00:27:34,702 --> 00:27:37,433
I'll go talk to him.
I'll get to the bottom of it.

283
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:39,997
You do that, Alan.

284
00:27:40,173 --> 00:27:44,439
And when you do,
you tell Rose that if he tries to bump us...

285
00:27:44,542 --> 00:27:49,067
...he'll find out just how hard
we "mackerel snappers" can bump back!

286
00:27:50,986 --> 00:27:55,781
Pete, get me a gobbler from the pen!
I feel like turkey tonight.

287
00:27:56,551 --> 00:27:58,709
You feel like turkey every night, Wilma.

288
00:28:13,107 --> 00:28:14,232
Wilma!

289
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:21,270
- What happened?
- Mud!

290
00:28:23,315 --> 00:28:26,149
Mud and shit! Goddamn turkey shit!

291
00:28:26,754 --> 00:28:28,339
Why'd someone go and do that?

292
00:28:29,425 --> 00:28:32,384
- Because I told her I'll kill it.
- Told who?

293
00:28:41,631 --> 00:28:42,893
Dot.

294
00:28:43,207 --> 00:28:46,604
- Yes, just a sec. It's for you.
- Me?

295
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,670
Okay, it's the square key. All the doors.

296
00:28:50,743 --> 00:28:54,110
Don't forget the lights.
You can do it. You'll be fine.

297
00:28:54,172 --> 00:28:56,645
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Night.

298
00:28:59,283 --> 00:29:01,116
Hi. This is Nettie.

299
00:29:01,689 --> 00:29:04,588
I know what you done, you crazy bitch!

300
00:29:05,058 --> 00:29:06,079
Done what?

301
00:29:06,224 --> 00:29:09,821
Fucking with me
was the worst mistake you ever made.

302
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:13,429
I'm going to get you for this,
you understand? You and your mutt!

303
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:17,765
You don't dare!
You stop bothering me and my Raider!

304
00:29:19,038 --> 00:29:24,062
- He's a good doggie!
- You won't see me coming!

305
00:29:41,889 --> 00:29:45,330
Guy sounds like he's havin'
a fucking pepoleptic fit.

306
00:29:45,695 --> 00:29:46,685
Yep.

307
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,400
Don't kick the Rock-Ola, Hugh.

308
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,537
You hear me?

309
00:29:57,142 --> 00:30:01,103
How you doing at the tracks, Dan?
Horses finally running your way?

310
00:30:01,312 --> 00:30:04,679
Every time, Henry. Every goddamn time.

311
00:30:04,753 --> 00:30:08,381
I'm gonna kick that jukebox wide open,
you don't fix it, Henry.

312
00:30:10,289 --> 00:30:12,915
All right. That's it. You're out of here.

313
00:30:12,988 --> 00:30:14,387
Give me that back.

314
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:18,054
Any of you fellas heading up to Castle Hill?
Hugh needs a lift.

315
00:30:18,535 --> 00:30:20,693
Pink slip is what Hugh needs.

316
00:30:21,537 --> 00:30:24,769
For a city employee making
an ass of himself in a public tavern.

317
00:30:25,071 --> 00:30:26,124
Yep.

318
00:30:28,878 --> 00:30:30,400
Nice to have friends.

319
00:30:39,417 --> 00:30:42,117
You know, Henry? They do it at night.

320
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:45,317
They come in,
and they take out the mirrors...

321
00:30:45,589 --> 00:30:50,354
...and they put in a piece of one-way glass
and stick a camera on the other side of it.

322
00:30:50,468 --> 00:30:54,491
Then they watch you,
and they laugh at you.

323
00:30:56,504 --> 00:30:59,663
And they take down every
single word you say.

324
00:31:02,238 --> 00:31:03,438
Yeah.

325
00:31:50,454 --> 00:31:54,395
- You're drenched to your soul.
- They threw me out!

326
00:31:54,991 --> 00:31:57,263
- I'm sorry.
- Here.

327
00:31:57,336 --> 00:32:02,130
Let me help you peel this thing off,
before you catch your death.

328
00:32:04,134 --> 00:32:06,771
You got a nice jacket in the window.

329
00:32:07,209 --> 00:32:12,474
A classic early-'50s beauty.
Warm as toast. Dry as a bone.

330
00:32:12,986 --> 00:32:17,175
It's just like the one I used to have
in high school, before I was a bum.

331
00:32:18,551 --> 00:32:20,543
When I was a kid.

332
00:32:20,625 --> 00:32:24,181
I'll bet there are quite a few people
in this shit pit of a town...

333
00:32:24,254 --> 00:32:26,558
...who wouldn't believe
you ever were a kid.

334
00:32:26,632 --> 00:32:30,394
I know. It's not fair. I try so hard.

335
00:32:31,395 --> 00:32:34,733
Not hard enough. So they crushed you.

336
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:39,611
They buried that wonderful boy
deep inside you.

337
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:42,279
- Which boy?
- This one.

338
00:32:43,916 --> 00:32:45,938
We'll find him again, Hugh.

339
00:32:46,814 --> 00:32:49,307
We'll resurrect him together.

340
00:32:49,922 --> 00:32:54,748
Because, all of a sudden,
it's 1955 all over again.

341
00:33:13,106 --> 00:33:16,203
It was the best hour
of the best day of my life.

342
00:33:18,684 --> 00:33:22,678
- God, I loved that jacket.
- Which jacket? This one.

343
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:29,047
This jacket, Hugh.
You could recover, retrace your steps.

344
00:33:29,652 --> 00:33:32,144
Take charge of your life again.

345
00:33:32,664 --> 00:33:34,926
God, this is still so beautiful.

346
00:33:35,167 --> 00:33:38,723
Say, Hugh, do you happen to know...

347
00:33:39,202 --> 00:33:42,756
...a nice little Baptist lady
called Nettie Cobb?

348
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:46,834
Sure. Crazy old wretch killed her husband.

349
00:33:47,541 --> 00:33:49,637
How much do you want for it?

350
00:34:11,103 --> 00:34:13,690
- Mr. Gaunt?
- I am he.

351
00:34:13,771 --> 00:34:17,567
Reverend Rose, sir,
of the First Baptist Church of Castle Rock.

352
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:21,236
May I take this opportunity
to welcome you to Castle Rock...

353
00:34:21,341 --> 00:34:23,332
...on the good Lord's behalf?

354
00:34:24,083 --> 00:34:26,607
- Why not?
- Excellent.

355
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:32,120
It's my unusual urgency when I ask,
what faith, sir, are you?

356
00:34:33,727 --> 00:34:37,020
- What faith?
- Religion.

357
00:34:38,865 --> 00:34:43,235
- You're not Catholic, are you?
- You might say that I am...

358
00:34:44,297 --> 00:34:47,696
...nondenominational.
- I knew it!

359
00:34:47,905 --> 00:34:52,503
Then you will have little objection
to my placing this in your front window.

360
00:34:56,046 --> 00:34:57,913
I couldn't possibly do that.

361
00:34:59,778 --> 00:35:03,908
You see, I, like you,
am here to serve everyone.

362
00:35:04,491 --> 00:35:07,682
However, by way of compensation...

363
00:35:07,994 --> 00:35:11,654
...perhaps I may offer you something,
which might interest you.

364
00:35:11,758 --> 00:35:13,790
Say, how about an objet d'art?

365
00:35:15,969 --> 00:35:20,994
What is your preference, Reverend?
Asian, Roman?

366
00:35:22,308 --> 00:35:24,863
That is 2nd century, Reverend.

367
00:35:26,573 --> 00:35:32,243
Wasn't it St. Augustine who said,
"Make me chaste, O Lord.

368
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:35,246
"But not yet, not yet"?

369
00:35:47,236 --> 00:35:48,423
Father.

370
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:52,792
Reverend.

371
00:36:13,862 --> 00:36:17,260
"Paper packages tied up with strings

372
00:36:17,959 --> 00:36:21,765
"These are a few of my favorite things"

373
00:36:25,798 --> 00:36:30,530
Yes. I'm so thrilled.
Thank you, Mr. Gaunt.

374
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:34,608
Treasure Island. First edition, actually.

375
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:37,871
Signed by Robert Louis Stevenson himself.

376
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:42,749
- It's magnificent.
- Take a gander.

377
00:36:44,356 --> 00:36:47,984
If it's too hot in here, Mr. Jewett,
just say the word.

378
00:36:49,797 --> 00:36:52,957
I'm afraid I have a tendency
to turn up the heat.

379
00:37:19,123 --> 00:37:20,489
Hello, Ms. Chalmers.

380
00:37:20,563 --> 00:37:23,253
- My goodness. What's wrong?
- Where did you...

381
00:37:24,357 --> 00:37:26,026
How long have you been there?

382
00:37:26,098 --> 00:37:29,801
I was just hoping for a cup of coffee.
I didn't realize you were closing.

383
00:37:31,906 --> 00:37:33,875
Coffee? Sure, no problem.

384
00:37:35,908 --> 00:37:39,672
- You're Mr. Gaunt.
- And you're Polly Chalmers.

385
00:37:41,883 --> 00:37:45,333
I'm sorry, I don't shake hands. I have...

386
00:37:45,689 --> 00:37:47,878
Arthritis. Forgive me. I forgot.

387
00:37:56,863 --> 00:38:00,023
You've been having a devil of a time
with it lately, haven't you?

388
00:38:02,035 --> 00:38:04,725
Yes. How did you know?

389
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:06,830
Nettie told me.

390
00:38:08,539 --> 00:38:09,802
Here.

391
00:38:11,042 --> 00:38:14,242
Just a tiny thank-you note
for that remarkable pie.

392
00:38:21,353 --> 00:38:22,751
My Lord.

393
00:38:22,854 --> 00:38:26,013
I don't think I ever had
a tastier cup of coffee.

394
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:33,291
You wouldn't, by any chance,
have something in the way of a doughnut?

395
00:38:33,363 --> 00:38:35,959
Something I might dunk, Ms. Chalmers?

396
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:42,069
Please, we're going to be neighbors.
Why don't you call me Polly?

397
00:39:07,601 --> 00:39:08,830
Go on.

398
00:39:15,043 --> 00:39:20,038
Oh, no! No! No! Shit!

399
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:29,420
- Dan, it's me.
- Jesus! What the hell are you doing?

400
00:39:29,493 --> 00:39:32,318
You scared the hell out of me,
sneaking up on me like that.

401
00:39:32,391 --> 00:39:35,457
- Put the gun down, Dan.
- Yeah.

402
00:39:39,699 --> 00:39:43,599
Another couple of seconds, I would've been
out of here. You would've missed me.

403
00:39:43,734 --> 00:39:46,830
- What can I do for you?
- I had a call from the state auditors.

404
00:39:46,903 --> 00:39:47,935
Yeah?

405
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:52,106
We have an Appropriations Committee
meeting next week to discuss budgets.

406
00:39:52,179 --> 00:39:55,514
- Guess what. It's on my calendar.
- They wanna be there.

407
00:39:55,578 --> 00:39:59,142
They want me to bring them printouts,
shit from city hall.

408
00:40:00,091 --> 00:40:04,084
Yeah, you know those bastards.
They're on some kind of fishing expedition.

409
00:40:04,552 --> 00:40:06,493
What the hell's going on?

410
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:15,364
I've been having some bad luck
at the track lately.

411
00:40:16,502 --> 00:40:20,806
So I borrowed some money from the town
petty cash fund to cover the shortfall.

412
00:40:20,911 --> 00:40:22,277
Jesus, Dan.

413
00:40:23,048 --> 00:40:26,239
I'm gonna pay it back.
I was gonna pay it back before next week.

414
00:40:26,312 --> 00:40:29,709
- Honest to God.
- How much we talking about here?

415
00:40:30,648 --> 00:40:34,609
- $20,000.
- $20,000? Jesus Christ!

416
00:40:34,693 --> 00:40:38,249
I'm getting a loan on my dealership
to pay it back, from Boston.

417
00:40:38,323 --> 00:40:39,385
When?

418
00:40:39,698 --> 00:40:42,887
Any day now.
Two days, four days, next week.

419
00:40:43,001 --> 00:40:44,190
Four days?

420
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,425
Done.

421
00:41:07,084 --> 00:41:09,419
You stall them for me, all right?

422
00:41:10,493 --> 00:41:13,654
- Yeah. I will. Till Monday.
- Okay, thanks a lot...

423
00:41:16,061 --> 00:41:20,295
- Believe me, I'll make it worth your while.
- Like hell, you will. Just pay it back.

424
00:41:20,367 --> 00:41:23,994
I just meant if you wanted a deal
on a new boat. It's all I meant, I swear.

425
00:41:24,066 --> 00:41:26,800
Whatever you want. And for Polly, too.

426
00:41:28,081 --> 00:41:30,343
- I'll get her a deal on...
- Monday!

427
00:41:45,594 --> 00:41:47,066
How's my boy?

428
00:41:48,265 --> 00:41:52,529
You have something that's mine, Brian,
that you haven't finished paying for.

429
00:41:52,601 --> 00:41:56,167
- But you said I could have it if...
- The dealing isn't done, you see...

430
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:59,565
...until Mr. Gaunt says the dealing is done.

431
00:42:31,936 --> 00:42:33,562
And away they go!

432
00:42:33,645 --> 00:42:37,045
She's A Hell-Raiser breaks on top
and goes straight to the lead...

433
00:42:37,118 --> 00:42:39,443
... followed by Confucius Sings and Mr. Lee.

434
00:42:39,516 --> 00:42:43,780
Lots Of Luck having a go wide, turning.
She's A Hell-Raiser...

435
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:49,357
Yeah! Boy, what the hell?

436
00:42:50,796 --> 00:42:54,226
- That was pretty fine.
- Fine as paint.

437
00:42:54,434 --> 00:42:58,626
- Can I...
- Careful. See, this is no ordinary toy.

438
00:42:59,835 --> 00:43:04,798
- What is it?
- You see, the man who sold this to me...

439
00:43:06,173 --> 00:43:09,979
...his father made their fortune from it.

440
00:43:10,645 --> 00:43:13,773
Every morning he'd take
the day's racing form...

441
00:43:14,117 --> 00:43:16,954
...and run its races
before they ever happened...

442
00:43:17,016 --> 00:43:19,320
...one by one, right on this board.

443
00:43:19,986 --> 00:43:23,980
He'd give each tin horse
the real name from the paper...

444
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:27,389
...do it just by touching and whispering.

445
00:43:28,869 --> 00:43:32,132
- A brand-new name.
- Citation.

446
00:43:32,434 --> 00:43:34,373
Sea Biscuit, Well Away...

447
00:43:35,136 --> 00:43:37,909
- Seattle Slew.
- Man O' War.

448
00:43:38,106 --> 00:43:39,973
Whoever were running that day.

449
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:43,839
Wind her up, let her go.

450
00:43:44,048 --> 00:43:46,144
Run the whole damn slate that way!

451
00:43:46,519 --> 00:43:48,103
Northern Dancer.

452
00:43:48,416 --> 00:43:50,583
Eight, ten, a dozen races.

453
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:53,453
Then go right to the track,
and bet on those fillies...

454
00:43:53,556 --> 00:43:57,320
...that won on this astonishing toy
from Japan Incorporated.

455
00:43:57,528 --> 00:44:01,553
He'd rake in the cash, Dan.
Rake in the goddamn cash.

456
00:44:01,636 --> 00:44:03,460
Rake in the cash.

457
00:44:07,506 --> 00:44:08,767
How much?

458
00:44:18,181 --> 00:44:19,619
Good day to you.

459
00:44:19,681 --> 00:44:21,747
- Good morning, Father.
- Father.

460
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:24,613
- What do you want?
- Coffee and the usual.

461
00:44:28,627 --> 00:44:30,055
Hey, Corn Cobb.

462
00:44:30,326 --> 00:44:33,027
- What's the button on your boob?
- You're crazy.

463
00:44:36,404 --> 00:44:40,271
- You leave me alone!
- Take it easy, Nettie.

464
00:44:40,699 --> 00:44:41,971
Put the knife down.

465
00:44:42,711 --> 00:44:44,109
Put it down.

466
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:51,844
Okay, Wilma. What'll it be?

467
00:44:52,782 --> 00:44:57,911
Raider on rye, a little glass of puppy pus,
and two nice doggie eyes.

468
00:44:57,986 --> 00:45:01,049
- Why don't you just order up or get out?
- Wilma.

469
00:45:02,458 --> 00:45:05,690
- Shit.
- It's okay.

470
00:45:06,263 --> 00:45:08,025
I'll go talk to her.

471
00:45:29,856 --> 00:45:33,190
April Dreaming, Junction Salute.

472
00:45:33,586 --> 00:45:35,121
She's A Hell-Raiser.

473
00:45:36,497 --> 00:45:39,394
Tammy's Wonder, Easy Sweep.

474
00:45:40,166 --> 00:45:42,262
That's My Boy.

475
00:45:43,804 --> 00:45:48,037
Yes, okay, little puppies.
You ready now? Let's run a good race.

476
00:45:48,141 --> 00:45:51,165
- Ready, set, go!
- And away they go!

477
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,970
And it's Tammy's Wonder. April Dreaming.

478
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:57,879
Junction Salute on the outside.
And Easy Sweep is far back.

479
00:45:58,452 --> 00:46:01,350
- Into the far turn.
- Neck and neck!

480
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:05,561
- Tammy's Wonder on the inside...
- Tammy's Wonder!

481
00:46:05,729 --> 00:46:09,357
Tammy's Wonder's gonna go on to win.
Tammy's Wonder from April Dreaming.

482
00:46:10,733 --> 00:46:14,633
We've got Love My Martinis, Trentier...

483
00:46:14,737 --> 00:46:17,531
...Doubter's Ridge, Rancadoo...

484
00:46:17,708 --> 00:46:20,939
...By George, and Confucius Sings.

485
00:46:21,044 --> 00:46:24,568
Little Chinese puppy.
Okay, fellas, now, let's go.

486
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,840
Make money for daddy!

487
00:46:28,477 --> 00:46:29,915
And they're off!

488
00:46:31,416 --> 00:46:33,752
- It's the white one, the red one.
- Danforth?

489
00:46:33,816 --> 00:46:36,150
It's the green one. God, they're beautiful.

490
00:46:36,223 --> 00:46:40,383
Look at those beautiful horses!
Run, run, run! Come on!

491
00:46:41,124 --> 00:46:44,583
Come on. Come on, horsies.
Who's gonna win here?

492
00:46:46,763 --> 00:46:49,671
- Danforth?
- Goddamn it! Go away!

493
00:46:49,734 --> 00:46:51,434
I'll be out when I'm out.

494
00:46:51,568 --> 00:46:54,403
- Aren't you going to work?
- I am at work!

495
00:46:56,875 --> 00:46:59,139
Would you like me
to go down to the bakery...

496
00:46:59,211 --> 00:47:01,442
...and maybe get some
honey-dipped doughnuts?

497
00:47:01,786 --> 00:47:06,050
Yeah. Honey-dipped doughnuts.

498
00:47:06,289 --> 00:47:10,481
Yeah, toilet paper, a nose job.
Just leave me alone!

499
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:15,422
You ready now? Let's run a good race.
Ready, set, go! They're off!

500
00:47:15,526 --> 00:47:18,895
And they're coming around the corner.

501
00:47:20,468 --> 00:47:24,367
It's a runaway victory!
Yeah! Come on, come on!

502
00:47:24,535 --> 00:47:25,660
Yeah!

503
00:48:04,714 --> 00:48:06,579
Good boy. Sit.

504
00:48:10,824 --> 00:48:15,315
Stay. Mommy's got to go scoot
and do something for Mr. Gaunt...

505
00:48:15,618 --> 00:48:17,389
...before it gets dark.

506
00:48:19,257 --> 00:48:20,695
But don't you worry.

507
00:48:21,465 --> 00:48:24,551
Mommy's going to lock all our doors
from now on.

508
00:48:28,274 --> 00:48:29,359
Stay.

509
00:48:57,569 --> 00:48:58,935
Lovely day.

510
00:49:04,502 --> 00:49:05,941
Come on, girls.

511
00:49:09,445 --> 00:49:12,907
The crowd is tense.
Brian Rusk doing the pitching.

512
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:17,482
And let me tell you, he is really
sensational. He's working on the no-hitter.

513
00:49:17,554 --> 00:49:21,391
We're in the bottom of the ninth inning.
A count of 2 and 2 on the batter.

514
00:49:21,454 --> 00:49:24,050
Two men on base,
but Brian has walked them both.

515
00:49:24,195 --> 00:49:27,521
Right now, he's checking the runners
leading off first and second.

516
00:49:27,595 --> 00:49:30,690
He's gotten the sign from the catcher,
the runners lead away...

517
00:49:30,765 --> 00:49:32,389
... and here's the pitch.

518
00:49:32,505 --> 00:49:35,466
Strike three! How about that?

519
00:49:36,706 --> 00:49:39,302
Will he make that no-hitter, or will he not?

520
00:49:42,607 --> 00:49:46,339
Brian Rusk. Man alive!
Is he really sharp today.

521
00:49:46,412 --> 00:49:50,687
Sensational control
of his 90 mile-an-hour fast ball.

522
00:49:51,051 --> 00:49:54,991
Still the chance of the no-hitter,
and he's ready to work.

523
00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:03,031
Rusk has got a swift curve ball
that's dipping and darting.

524
00:50:03,104 --> 00:50:05,595
And his fast ball, they can't touch it.

525
00:50:06,365 --> 00:50:08,836
Brian Rusk is delivering a performance...

526
00:50:08,910 --> 00:50:11,891
... that can take the Yankees
to another World Series.

527
00:50:11,975 --> 00:50:13,497
How about that?

528
00:50:17,041 --> 00:50:21,317
Brian Rusk is ready, and he delivers.
And the pitch...

529
00:50:27,153 --> 00:50:28,624
Jesus Christ.

530
00:50:29,895 --> 00:50:31,263
Good girls.

531
00:50:39,165 --> 00:50:40,437
Yessiree.

532
00:50:41,176 --> 00:50:42,970
We're having fun now.

533
00:51:04,497 --> 00:51:05,895
Raider!

534
00:51:07,167 --> 00:51:08,752
Little pal!

535
00:51:18,009 --> 00:51:21,000
Raider. How they hanging?

536
00:51:26,547 --> 00:51:30,353
Good fella. Yeah. Ain't you?

537
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:33,824
And ain't you got a face
just cute as a baby bug?

538
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:35,982
Yes, you do.

539
00:51:36,054 --> 00:51:40,392
And you know what I got?
I got a beautiful jacket.

540
00:51:40,695 --> 00:51:42,164
Yes, I do.

541
00:51:42,936 --> 00:51:44,832
And you know what else?

542
00:51:45,365 --> 00:51:46,992
I'm gonna keep it.

543
00:52:02,683 --> 00:52:05,654
They're rounding the bend,
and yellow, and white, and pink...

544
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:23,762
"Punky Boy. " Yeah.

545
00:52:56,205 --> 00:53:01,875
"Gasco Thunder, Hooded Lady,
Mr. P, Lotsa Luck, and Rosie D...

546
00:53:02,919 --> 00:53:06,641
"... Punky Boy, Raise The Dead,
Frank's The Name, Gimme Shelter...

547
00:53:06,714 --> 00:53:08,184
"... Sudden Fame. "

548
00:54:42,055 --> 00:54:44,848
God! I'll kill him! I'll fucking kill him!

549
00:54:45,182 --> 00:54:46,650
Ridgewick!

550
00:54:50,988 --> 00:54:52,187
Raider?

551
00:54:59,328 --> 00:55:00,797
Mommy's home.

552
00:55:01,997 --> 00:55:03,092
Raid?

553
00:57:19,643 --> 00:57:21,134
What the fuck?

554
00:57:27,588 --> 00:57:28,952
That bitch!

555
00:57:38,023 --> 00:57:40,254
You killed my doggie, you bitch!

556
00:57:41,233 --> 00:57:43,965
You broke my microwave, you crazy fuck!

557
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:17,356
Wilma?

558
00:58:18,430 --> 00:58:20,028
See the windows?

559
00:58:21,142 --> 00:58:22,403
They're busted!

560
00:59:20,535 --> 00:59:22,965
Wilma? You all right?

561
00:59:41,876 --> 00:59:43,399
Come on, bitch.

562
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:46,306
Come for me, if you're coming.

563
00:59:57,588 --> 00:59:58,744
Wilma.

564
01:00:04,884 --> 01:00:09,325
There's nothing quite so invigorating
as a crisp fall day in New England.

565
01:00:09,388 --> 01:00:11,860
- Don't you agree?
- Mr. Gaunt...

566
01:00:11,922 --> 01:00:13,288
Leland.

567
01:00:15,164 --> 01:00:17,353
I'm sorry. I can't even think.

568
01:00:17,698 --> 01:00:22,523
Believe me, Polly, I know you're in pain,
so I shall dispense with the small talk.

569
01:00:23,099 --> 01:00:27,696
I'll give you the item I called you about
and send you home.

570
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:30,030
- Give it to me?
- More or less.

571
01:00:30,167 --> 01:00:32,971
But let's leave that until later, shall we?

572
01:00:36,170 --> 01:00:38,328
When it rains, it pours.

573
01:00:46,274 --> 01:00:47,765
They're after me.

574
01:00:47,942 --> 01:00:51,881
Go upstairs, Mr. Keeton, to my apartment.
Make yourself a nice cup of tea.

575
01:00:51,946 --> 01:00:54,614
- I'll be with you in a minute.
- I don't have a minute.

576
01:00:54,686 --> 01:00:56,239
Go upstairs.

577
01:01:19,894 --> 01:01:23,524
It was funny.
They were actually feeling much better.

578
