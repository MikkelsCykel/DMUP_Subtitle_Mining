Well, that depends upon the part
and who the director is...

2
00:00:04,091 --> 00:00:06,546
and whether or not
I've had enough to drink.

3
00:00:06,619 --> 00:00:09,685
That's not a very
comforting answer.

4
00:00:09,755 --> 00:00:11,991
I didn't like the question.

- No, it's not Bernard. It's me.</i>

7
00:00:39,771 --> 00:00:42,227
<i>- Lan.
- Christ, I've been waitin'out here all night.</i>

8
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,154
- What are you talking about?
- Who's Bernard?

9
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:46,358
Who is Bernard leaving
your apartment in the morning?

10
00:00:46,429 --> 00:00:48,763
- Lan, have you- have you been spying on me?
- Who is he?

11
00:00:48,828 --> 00:00:51,512
Is he the director or the producer
of your new French film?

12
00:00:51,581 --> 00:00:53,686
Lan, I can't believe you've
been waiting outside my flat.

13
00:00:53,757 --> 00:00:55,961
Angela, I thought we were
making plans together.

14
00:00:56,029 --> 00:00:58,930
- Well, what kind of plans?
- I thought we were going to California together.

15
00:00:59,004 --> 00:01:01,525
Lan, I have a life here.
I can't just pack up and go.

16
00:01:01,596 --> 00:01:03,930
You'll have your business and
I'll end up waiting on tables.

17
00:01:03,996 --> 00:01:07,063
You won't have to wait on tables.
I'll be there lookin' out for you.

18
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:10,613
L- I don't understand
what you want from me.

19
00:01:10,685 --> 00:01:16,250
What do you want from me? I'm-I'm-I'm
moody and I'm-I'm self-obsessed.

20
00:01:16,317 --> 00:01:18,324
And I'm ambitious.

21

I sense you're bluffing.
- No, I'm not.</i>

22
00:01:21,852 --> 00:01:24,241
I'm gonna take you
to California, Angela. I am.

23
00:01:24,317 --> 00:01:29,052
And if you don't think I will,
then-then call my bluff. I am.

[Chattering]

25
00:01:39,582 --> 00:01:42,036
Have you thought about how we're
gonna take care of Martin Burns?

26
00:01:42,109 --> 00:01:44,281
No. Have you?

27
00:01:44,349 --> 00:01:46,323
Come here.

28
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:50,392
I want it to be like
a hit-and-run accident.

29
00:01:50,461 --> 00:01:53,756
It's tricky, 'cause someone could see the
license plate and we couldn't be sure he'd die.

30
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:56,156
- Well, I know I'm not stickin' a knife in him.
- Why not?

31
00:01:56,221 --> 00:01:59,036
'Cause I can't. Can you?

32
00:01:59,102 --> 00:02:02,200
I don't know, Terry. I don't know what
I'm capable of till I'm facing the moment.

33
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,244
- You could kill him with a knife?
- Or a hammer.

34
00:02:04,317 --> 00:02:06,172
I was thinkin' like
a muggin' with a hammer.

35
00:02:06,237 --> 00:02:10,744
Jesus, I'm startin' to think I don't know you,
lan. Look, if we do this, it-it has to be-

36
00:02:10,813 --> 00:02:12,668
What? Nice and clean
and sanitized...

37
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:14,588
so we can fool ourselves
about what we're doing?

38
00:02:14,653 --> 00:02:17,556
- I'm just sayin' there's a line I can't cross.
- A gun is the quickest way.

39
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:20,020
I'm just sayin' let's do it
as humanely as possible, all right?

40
00:02:20,094 --> 00:02:21,949
- We could strangle him with a wire.
- [Sighs]

41
00:02:22,014 --> 00:02:25,331
We could get him on the ground,
the two of us, and strangle him with a wire.

42
00:02:25,407 --> 00:02:27,545
This isn't us, lan.
It's not the Blaine brothers.

43
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:29,916
The Blaine brothers are
a couple of losers, Terry.

44
00:02:29,982 --> 00:02:33,975
<i>- [Train Passing]
- There's no great pride to be had
in what we've achieved.</i>

45
00:02:34,046 --> 00:02:37,210
Well, look, if we strangle him,
he'd put up a fight, right?

46
00:02:37,279 --> 00:02:39,613
Now, I think we could take him,
but it could get messy.

47
00:02:39,678 --> 00:02:43,159
Well, we'll have to make a decision one way
or the other. We've only got three weeks.

48
00:02:43,231 --> 00:02:47,006
[Sighs] I can't talk about it.
Let's just enjoy our drinks.

49
00:02:48,447 --> 00:02:53,465
Carol's had an accident.
Except I don't think it was an accident.

50
00:02:53,534 --> 00:02:55,640
<i>I think she was drunk
when she took the car...</i>

51
00:02:55,711 --> 00:02:58,012
<i>and she didn't much care if
she made it back to town or not.</i>

52
00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:01,527
Well, suppose if I told you I don't care.
In fact, I'm glad it happened.

53
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,453
I only wish it'd been fatal.

54
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,268
It might be yet.
Everything's a bit touch and go.

55
00:03:06,336 --> 00:03:09,150
It's funny how life
boils down to this.

56
00:03:09,216 --> 00:03:12,150
Life is nothing
if not totally ironic.

57
00:03:13,407 --> 00:03:16,724
Usually brilliant.
Well done. Well done, as always.

58
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:19,450
- There she is. Hello, darlin'.
- Oh, hi.

59
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,886
- How are you? You were fantastic again.
- I'm all right.

60
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:24,057
- This is Kate and Terry.
- Oh, lovely to meet you.

61
00:03:24,128 --> 00:03:26,550
They've been dying to meet you.
I've been going on and on and on about you.

62
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,893
- Brother. Nice to meet you.
- Yeah, I loved it.

63
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,869
Thank you so much.
It was really nice of you to come.

64
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,799
- Brilliant.
- Thank you. It means a lot.

65
00:03:32,864 --> 00:03:35,711
What are you up to this evening?
Do you wanna- Do you wanna join us?

66
00:03:35,775 --> 00:03:37,630
We're going to a party.
My friend finished filming today.

67
00:03:37,695 --> 00:03:39,124
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah?

68
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:41,054
- Yeah, that'd be great.
- It's okay with you?

69
00:03:41,119 --> 00:03:43,388
Yeah, that'd be great. Bit of a squeeze,
though, Terry. Bit of a crush.

70
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:45,660
- I'll manage.
- Hold your stomach in.

[Chattering]

73
00:03:56,864 --> 00:03:59,319
I can see why you're
so crazy about Angela.

74
00:03:59,392 --> 00:04:01,432
She's very, very different
from the women you've known.

75
00:04:01,504 --> 00:04:03,392
I've never been with
anyone like her before.

76
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:05,311
And we've known
a few juicy ones.

77
00:04:05,376 --> 00:04:07,231
Do you remember
Fenella Griffith?

78
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,663
Remember her? You passed her off to me.
How could I forget?

79
00:04:09,728 --> 00:04:12,249
You make it sound like it wasn't
the biggest favor in the world.

80
00:04:12,321 --> 00:04:14,972
I never said she wasn't
wonderfully depraved.

81
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:19,197
[Chuckles] Angela's better than that, though.
She's innocent and also depraved.

82
00:04:19,264 --> 00:04:22,493
She's working class, but classy.
And that smile, Terry, that smile.

83
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,415
Lovely. Oh, she's lovely.

84
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,896
<i>[Terry] Look at the two of them. Dancin'
and laughin'like there's no tomorrow.</i>

85
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:31,897
"Ain't life grand," Terry? Do you know
what that's from? "Ain't life grand?"

86
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:39,287
- One day you reach a point
and there is no tomorrow, lan.
- Oh, Terry.

87
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,466
All right, look, we just
have to take care of business.

88
00:04:41,536 --> 00:04:43,609
Then it'll be done
and we can move on.

89
00:04:45,376 --> 00:04:49,238
- I figured out how to do it.
- Yeah?

90
00:04:49,313 --> 00:04:51,223
Come here.

91
00:04:56,097 --> 00:05:00,832
- Remember when we were kids?
Bobby North from down the road?
- I remember he was a bad kid.

92
00:05:00,897 --> 00:05:03,712
Yeah. Yeah, well, me and Bobby
made a gun once. He showed me how.

93
00:05:03,778 --> 00:05:06,526
- What, you made one?
- Yeah, we made a gun out of wood, right?

94
00:05:06,593 --> 00:05:10,750
And-And-And a little piece of metal.
It fired one bullet.

95
00:05:10,817 --> 00:05:14,396
- Do you ever hear of people
talkin' about a zip gun?
- Yeah, but was it reliable?

96
00:05:14,466 --> 00:05:17,019
It's the real thing, lan.
You can't trace it back, all right?

97
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:20,406
Cause when you're finished, you take the
wood, which is most of it, and you burn it.

98
00:05:20,482 --> 00:05:23,068
Then you take the metal pieces and
you dump 'em down different sewers.

99
00:05:23,138 --> 00:05:24,993
- Yeah, but one shot, Terry.
- What?

100
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:26,912
You'll have to make
two of them- one each.

101
00:05:26,977 --> 00:05:29,344
That way if anything happens,
or goes wrong, we've got a backup.

102
00:05:29,409 --> 00:05:32,279
Right. Well, I think I can get
me hands on a couple of bullets.

103
00:05:32,354 --> 00:05:34,525
Yeah. I don't think there's any question.
Two loaded guns.

104
00:05:34,593 --> 00:05:36,536
We can make this come off quick and clean.

105
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:39,807
What are you in such deep conversation about?
Are you plotting an assassination?

106
00:05:39,874 --> 00:05:43,737
- Come on, I want to dance. It's our song.
- Yeah? Oh, yeah. All right.

Who was that guy
you were talking to?

109
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:51,581
What? Tim?
He's, um, a writer.

110
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:53,789
He just sold one of his screenplays
to a Hollywood studio.

111
00:05:53,858 --> 00:05:56,706
- Well, he couldn't take his eyes off you.
- Is that bad?

112
00:05:56,771 --> 00:05:59,105
Well, I'm sure it wasn't
thrilling for his wife.

113
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:01,691
That wasn't his wife, that was his date.
Are you angry with me?

114
00:06:01,763 --> 00:06:03,618
I know what's in his mind.

115
00:06:03,683 --> 00:06:06,912
Lan, I don't affect everyone
the way that I affect you.

116
00:06:06,978 --> 00:06:09,499
If I did, my career would have
taken off a long time ago.

117
00:06:09,571 --> 00:06:13,629

- Oh, lan, don't be angry with me.

118
00:06:13,698 --> 00:06:17,495
I was really looking forward
to taking you to bed tonight.

119
00:06:17,571 --> 00:06:21,051
Sorry to interrupt.
There's Evan Macy over there. I love him.

120
00:06:21,123 --> 00:06:24,472
I'd give anything for his autograph, but
I don't want to seem obnoxious or nothing.

121
00:06:24,547 --> 00:06:28,224
Well, l-I know him. We did a TV film together.
I could introduce you if you like.

122
00:06:28,292 --> 00:06:30,147
- No, really?
- Yeah, of course.

123
00:06:30,212 --> 00:06:32,067
Oh, yeah.
[Giggles]

124
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:34,946
So just imagine it, right?

125
00:06:35,011 --> 00:06:36,921
I'm there with aces up.

126
00:06:36,995 --> 00:06:39,416
And he bets, bets big.

127
00:06:39,491 --> 00:06:43,288
All right. I see this
little tick in his cheek.

128
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:48,450
L-I called him
for L30,000 and I won.

I'm a friend ofJohn Fowler.

134
00:07:03,267 --> 00:07:05,634
We were at university together.

135
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:09,213
In those days, I kept myself
in fine style playing poker.

136
00:07:09,284 --> 00:07:11,520
You obviously play
high stakes, Mr., uh-

137
00:07:12,644 --> 00:07:14,532
Sometimes.

138
00:07:14,596 --> 00:07:17,630
I met my ex-wife
at a poker game years ago.

139
00:07:17,701 --> 00:07:20,602
When she left me, she said I neglected her
because I preferred playing.

140
00:07:20,676 --> 00:07:24,670
It wasn't true.
But her lawyers used it as a strategy.

141
00:07:25,796 --> 00:07:28,066
My dad taught me poker.

142
00:07:28,132 --> 00:07:31,394
He was a poor man, ran a restaurant
down in the south coast.

143
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,599
Taught me the ins and outs
of the game, lucky too.

144
00:07:33,669 --> 00:07:38,142
I could never have kept myself
on my expensive habits on his salary.

145
00:07:39,205 --> 00:07:41,343
Terry, Kate's looking for you.

146
00:07:41,413 --> 00:07:44,511
Lan, Martin Burns.
My brother, lan.

147
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,784
We've just discovered
we're both poker players.

148
00:07:46,853 --> 00:07:49,274
There's a wonderful game in town.
I'd invite you both to play...

149
00:07:49,348 --> 00:07:51,203
but I have to leave
right after the weekend.

150
00:07:51,268 --> 00:07:55,392
- This weekend?
- Yeah. Seems I get to London
less and less these days.

151
00:07:55,461 --> 00:07:59,836
I thought I'd be here the month, but, uh,
seems my presence is required in California.

152
00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:02,527
Well, that's a great pity
if you had your heart set on staying.

153
00:08:02,597 --> 00:08:06,525
Ah, well, duty calls. And I will have time
to dine with my old mum before I go.

154
00:08:06,597 --> 00:08:10,110
She's 91. At that age,
you can go at any moment.

155
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:14,016
Great old girl.
Let's hope I have her genes.

Good luck with the poker.

00:08:20,774 --> 00:08:23,229
- I'm stunned.
- You turned white as a ghost.

159
00:08:23,301 --> 00:08:25,156
How long have you been talking to him?

160
00:08:25,221 --> 00:08:28,003
- A couple of minutes, l-I lost my breath.
- What about?

161
00:08:28,069 --> 00:08:30,939
Nothing. Uh, poker, life.

162
00:08:31,013 --> 00:08:34,112
What are the chances of that? The last thing
we wanted to do was meet him, and then-

163
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:36,996
- What are the odds?
- You always said how unpredictable life is.

164
00:08:37,062 --> 00:08:39,451
How long will it take you
to get those guns made?

165
00:08:39,525 --> 00:08:41,795
- I can't do this, lan.
- Look, Terry, you've been drinking.

166
00:08:41,862 --> 00:08:44,164
You lose your confidence
when you're drunk.

167

Listen. I can't keep begging you to do this
with me. He's leaving in a couple of days.

168
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:53,058
- Are you in or out?
- I never said I wouldn't do it, right?

169
00:08:53,126 --> 00:08:55,941
Well, then, pull yourself together.

170

Lan.

171
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:02,245
I had such a wonderful time.

172
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:05,823
Angela's lovely, ain't she?
She's not at all snobby.

173

She said she'd take me shopping.

174
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:09,925
I love the way she dresses.

175
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:12,673
I thought it might be way
out of my range, but she said no.

176
00:09:12,742 --> 00:09:15,295
- What are you thinking?
- Nothing.

177
00:09:15,366 --> 00:09:17,755
Who was that man
you was talking to at the bar?

178
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:20,383
- Is that Mr. Burns?
- How do you know Mr. Burns?

179
00:09:20,454 --> 00:09:23,302
I was introduced.
He's sweet, isn't he?

180
00:09:23,367 --> 00:09:25,222
Didn't he know
your Uncle Howard?

181
00:09:25,287 --> 00:09:27,262
Is that what you was
talking to him about?

182

<i>You told him
Howard was our uncle?</i>

183
00:09:29,479 --> 00:09:32,643
It just seemed to come up, 'cause he's on
the board of one of Howard's foundations.

184
00:09:32,711 --> 00:09:36,420
That's what he said. Actually,
he was looking for you just before we left.

185
00:09:36,487 --> 00:09:38,341
Well, why did you
have to mention it, Kate?

186
00:09:38,407 --> 00:09:42,684
What are you getting so upset for?
We spoke for two minutes if that.

187
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:46,621
Although I did get the impression
he's got mixed feelings about your uncle.

188
00:09:46,695 --> 00:09:49,543
Yeah, he seemed a little sarcastic.
I could be wrong.

189
00:09:49,607 --> 00:09:52,706
Did-Did he, uh, imply
bad things about Howard?

190
00:09:52,776 --> 00:09:54,718
Yeah, I got that impression.

191
00:09:54,792 --> 00:09:57,508
Actually, he was really surprised
to hear that you were his nephew.

in the cupboard in the-

I leave it in the medicine cabinet.

- No, you're right.

Look, he always eats out.
So we just need to get in there.

00:18:11,409 --> 00:18:13,384
I told you it was just a loan.

290
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:15,563
And, Dad, there's a nice,
big bonus in here for you.

291
00:18:15,633 --> 00:18:18,949
Don't tell me that
won't come in handy.

292
00:18:19,025 --> 00:18:21,327
Where'd you get
money like that, lan?

293
00:18:21,393 --> 00:18:24,208
You know, I'm involved
in certain business ventures.

294
00:18:24,273 --> 00:18:26,128
What sort of
business ventures?

295
00:18:26,193 --> 00:18:28,299
I told you. The hotels.

296
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:32,909
Wait, I thought you said that
your hotel deals had been delayed.

297
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:35,399
Well, this is an advance.
Will you just take it?

298
00:18:35,474 --> 00:18:37,808
- Where's it coming from?
- Will you just take it?

299
00:18:37,873 --> 00:18:41,354
Look, soon this place will be back on its feet
and you won't be so dependent on me.

300
00:18:41,426 --> 00:18:44,393
- Where are you going?
- Well, I'm not gonna work here forever.

301
00:18:44,466 --> 00:18:48,689
- Well, who's gonna run things?
- Oh, Dad, give me a break.

302
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:51,690
Look.

303
00:18:51,762 --> 00:18:54,926
You know that- that I love you.

304
00:18:54,994 --> 00:18:58,060
I mean, I've stuck it out here all these years,
even though it's not for me...

305
00:18:58,130 --> 00:18:59,985
because of loyalty to you.

306
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:02,570
And I know that some of those business
plans in the past didn't pan out...

307
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,497
but this one is different, Dad.

308
00:19:04,562 --> 00:19:06,417
This one is different.

309
00:19:06,482 --> 00:19:08,970
And I'm just mad about the girl.

310
00:19:14,099 --> 00:19:19,216
It's funny how life
has a life of its own.

311
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,836
- Oh, Dad, Dad-
- No, you're right, lan.

312
00:19:21,907 --> 00:19:25,071
Nobody wants to be selfish,
but everybody is.

313
00:19:25,139 --> 00:19:27,244
No, you're not.

314
00:19:27,315 --> 00:19:29,803
I have been.

315
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:33,170
And it's because-
I think it's because I've been scared.

316
00:19:34,483 --> 00:19:37,167
You're a good boy. I've always
thought you had potential.

317
00:19:37,235 --> 00:19:39,788
You're both good boys,
you and your brother.

318
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:43,471
I've always wanted
to make sure...

319
00:19:43,539 --> 00:19:47,696
that I've loved you
and Terry absolutely equally.

320
00:19:47,763 --> 00:19:50,447
Well, you have,
you-you absolutely have.

321
00:19:51,476 --> 00:19:53,865
Dad, don't worry about a thing.

322
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,809
Everything's gonna be fine.

323
00:19:56,884 --> 00:19:59,634
Everything's gonna be fine. I promise.

324
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,773
All right.

325
00:20:06,355 --> 00:20:09,138
I thought I was pregnant.
It's a false alarm.

326
00:20:09,204 --> 00:20:11,059
- Pregnant?
- Yeah.

327
00:20:11,124 --> 00:20:14,572
- I was late. I'm never late, am I?
- But you're not. That's a relief.

328
00:20:14,644 --> 00:20:16,499
- Why?
- [Mutters]

329
00:20:16,564 --> 00:20:20,045
- I think it would be great.
We always talked about it.
- Yeah, some day.

330
00:20:20,117 --> 00:20:23,597
We can swing it. Now your
uncle's helped you out financially.

331
00:20:23,669 --> 00:20:27,378
<i>And you said that he might help you out
with that loan for that sport shop idea.</i>

332
00:20:29,076 --> 00:20:31,312
I think you'd make such a good dad.

333
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:36,203
And just think, if we had boys, you know, you
could teach them to play football or something.

334
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:38,131
Right.

335
00:20:40,052 --> 00:20:42,442
- You're not hungry?
- Not really, love.

336
00:20:42,516 --> 00:20:44,371
- It's very nice.
- It's your favorite.

337
00:20:44,436 --> 00:20:47,732
I know. Can I get
a whiskey, please?

338
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,155
- A whiskey?
- Yeah.

339
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:54,155
- I don't know if we got any left.
- It's in my drawer.

340
00:20:56,629 --> 00:20:58,734
[Mutters]

341
00:21:08,597 --> 00:21:11,630
- You're late.
- Sorry, sorry.

342
00:21:11,701 --> 00:21:13,872
Oh, Jesus Christ.
You've been drinking.

343
00:21:13,941 --> 00:21:17,968
I'm fine. I said I'm fine.
Just leave it at that, all right?

344
00:21:18,037 --> 00:21:19,979
Let's just do it, Brother,
before I change my mind.

345
00:21:20,054 --> 00:21:22,923
- Have you got the guns?
- Here. Right here. And the bullets.

346
00:21:22,997 --> 00:21:25,136
All right, all right.
Don't load them now.

347
00:21:25,206 --> 00:21:27,956
- Are you too drunk to handle this, Terry?
- I said I'm fine.

348
00:21:28,022 --> 00:21:30,259
- All right, let's just go.
- Right.

349
00:21:30,326 --> 00:21:32,562
We'll go up to him when
he's on his own, we shoot him...

350
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:34,768
and then I'll put a second one
in him just to make certain.

351
00:21:34,837 --> 00:21:37,904
I know what to do, lan. Right?
You don't always have to run things.

352
00:21:37,974 --> 00:21:41,454
- Can you handle this, the state you're in?
- Worry about yourself.

353
00:21:41,526 --> 00:21:44,690
- All right? I'll take care of him. Just-
- [Engine Starts]

354
00:21:44,758 --> 00:21:47,442
- Have you got the address?
- Yeah, I've got it. Let's get this over with.

355
00:21:53,878 --> 00:21:56,430
Don't worry about the restaurant.

356
00:21:56,501 --> 00:21:59,185
I can help you if you need me.

357
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:05,456
I dreamed about the boys last night.

358
00:22:05,527 --> 00:22:07,381
Again?

359
00:22:09,334 --> 00:22:12,117
When they were younger.

360
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:31,700
<i>There he is.
Let's take him now.</i>

361
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:34,255
Wait. You don't wanna let him
see his mum for the last time?

362
00:22:34,327 --> 00:22:36,182
- What?
- You make me sick.

363
00:22:36,248 --> 00:22:38,320
Let him see the old lady.

364
00:22:38,391 --> 00:22:42,100
You're drunk, Terry. It's a disgrace
turning up on a job like this drunk.

365
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:44,271
<i>Look, we've probably missed
our last opportunity now.</i>

366
00:22:44,342 --> 00:22:46,285
<i>We'll get him
when he comes out.</i>

367
00:22:46,358 --> 00:22:50,352
Christ. You don't care about anyone
in this world except yourself.

368
00:22:50,423 --> 00:22:53,423
You're not a big shot, lan.
You're a small stakes player.

369
00:22:53,495 --> 00:22:56,561
I don't care how many hotels you wind up
running or how hot that girl is.

370
00:22:56,631 --> 00:22:58,486
Why don't you shut up?

371
00:22:58,551 --> 00:23:01,716
I bet you had a big handful of those pills
that guy keeps you supplied with as well.

372
00:23:01,784 --> 00:23:04,019
I'm fine.

373
00:23:04,087 --> 00:23:06,193
We'll kill him
when he comes out.

374
00:25:09,722 --> 00:25:11,991
- Mr. Burns.
- Hey?

375
00:25:12,058 --> 00:25:14,612
Oh, that's right. I remember you.
We met at that, uh, party.

376
00:25:14,683 --> 00:25:17,497
- Yeah. We-We thought it was you.
- I understand you're Howard Swann's nephews.

377
00:25:17,563 --> 00:25:19,864
- That's right.
- What are you doing around here?
You live around here?

378
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:21,839
- No. Lan?
- Do it now.

379
00:25:21,914 --> 00:25:23,769
- Let's just do it now.
- Hey, what's going on?

380
00:25:23,834 --> 00:25:26,868
<i>- Terry, do it! Do it now!

What are you thinking?

383
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:53,200
That then was then.

384
00:25:54,907 --> 00:25:57,046
And now is now.

385
00:25:58,043 --> 00:26:00,465
And we've done it and it's over.

386
00:26:02,652 --> 00:26:04,790
And it's always now.

387
00:26:05,851 --> 00:26:09,047
It went much smoother
than I thought, lan.

388
00:26:09,115 --> 00:26:11,504
And not a soul around.

389
00:26:11,579 --> 00:26:13,914
We're lucky he chose that path.

390
00:26:13,979 --> 00:26:16,019
Yeah, no one saw us.

391
00:26:16,092 --> 00:26:18,231
And we did the right thing.

392
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:21,616
We didn't run back to the car.
We just walked calmly back.

393
00:26:21,692 --> 00:26:23,547
Yeah.

394
00:26:23,612 --> 00:26:26,394
There's a great weight off my back.

You're right, lan.

396
00:26:30,076 --> 00:26:32,727
It's now.

397
00:26:32,796 --> 00:26:34,934
It's always now.

398
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:39,060
You better burn his wallet.

399
00:26:56,764 --> 00:26:59,220

any new developments on California?

404
00:27:26,109 --> 00:27:29,622
Yeah, I think we can leave in about four
or six weeks. We signed the papers today.

405
00:27:29,693 --> 00:27:31,701
Great. Did you see in the papers...

406
00:27:31,774 --> 00:27:35,799
that guy that you were speaking to
at the wrap party was murdered?

Look, you spoke about, uh...</i>

a sports shop if you had the backing?

00:29:13,215 --> 00:29:15,997
Oh, yes, Angela said you were
planning an extended stay out there.

437
00:29:16,063 --> 00:29:18,682
- Well, very extended, I hope.
- California.

438
00:29:18,752 --> 00:29:20,607
I'm starving. Where are we eating?

439
00:29:20,672 --> 00:29:23,607
- I'm taking you all to Claridge's.
- Oh, is it nice?

440
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,981
- Lovely.
- No, it's on us, though.

441
00:29:26,047 --> 00:29:27,902
No, no, no.
This treat is on me. Yeah.

442
00:29:27,967 --> 00:29:29,822
Oh, thank you.
Very nice of you.

443
00:29:29,887 --> 00:29:31,894
Oh, they're really lovely,
your parents. Lovely.

444
00:29:31,967 --> 00:29:34,072
- Oh, I can't get California out of my mind.
- I know.

445
00:29:34,143 --> 00:29:38,105
I've spoken to Uncle Howard
and everything is right on track.

446
00:29:40,896 --> 00:29:43,001
Thank you.

447
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:45,461
- She's beautiful, isn't she?
- Very, very.

448
00:29:45,536 --> 00:29:48,089
A bit high maintenance, though.

449
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:52,600
- You up to it?
- I certainly hope so.

450
00:29:52,671 --> 00:29:54,908
She could've had
the pick of any man, that girl.

451
00:29:54,976 --> 00:29:57,365
Well, I realize I'm very lucky.
I do realize that.

452
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:03,136
I always dreaded the thought that she might
wind up with some starving actor in the theater.

453
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,535
Not that I've anything
against the theater, mind you...

454
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:10,586
but... a man who knows his way
around the world of business, well-

455
00:30:10,656 --> 00:30:13,951
There was a time when I could've
invested in some ventures...

456
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:18,042
but I didn't have
the stomach for the risk.

457
00:30:18,113 --> 00:30:23,328
So I spent my life behind the wheel
of a car driving other men.

458
00:30:26,049 --> 00:30:28,602
She says you've got a future.

459
00:30:31,681 --> 00:30:33,590
[Gasps]
Oh, God.

460
00:30:33,664 --> 00:30:36,315
- What is it?
- I can't take it.

461
00:30:36,384 --> 00:30:39,101
- Take it easy. It's all right.
- I need another pill.

462
00:30:39,169 --> 00:30:41,886
No, Terry. You can't take so many
of those, not with all that alcohol.

463
00:30:41,953 --> 00:30:45,914
Kate, leave me alone.
I've gotta get rid of this feeling of panic.

464
00:30:45,985 --> 00:30:48,603
- Why should you be feeling panicked?
- I don't know.

465
00:30:48,673 --> 00:30:52,187
I just need the pill. Christ,
I can't even get a decent night's sleep.

466
00:30:52,257 --> 00:30:54,494
All right.

467
00:30:57,217 --> 00:30:59,584
My car didn't have that dent
when I brought it in.

468
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:02,879
<i>- It had to have been there. Nobody's touched it.
- No, you put a dent in my car.</i>

469
00:31:02,945 --> 00:31:05,116
- How the hell would I dent it?
- I don't know.

470
00:31:05,185 --> 00:31:08,317
- What's going on?
- There's a dent, look, in my car.
Someone's driven my car.

471
00:31:08,386 --> 00:31:10,939
- Will you shut up? What are you accusing me of?
- Someone has to have driven it.

472
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:12,865
Look where you point your finger.
It could get broken.

473
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:14,785
- Calm down. Calm down.
- Get your hands off me.

474
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:16,705
Sorry, Mr. Finn.
Just give us a minute.

475
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:18,624
I'll sort out
your bodywork for you.

476
00:31:18,689 --> 00:31:21,145
I need a word with you.
What the hell's the matter with you?

477
00:31:21,218 --> 00:31:25,146
Look, I'm not at all pleased with the way
things are going around here lately. All right?

478
00:31:25,218 --> 00:31:27,422
Hey! There's another one here.

479
00:31:30,242 --> 00:31:33,057
Yeah, I miss you too.

480
00:31:33,122 --> 00:31:36,919
<i>- Nobu. Yeah, I made
reservations for after the show.
- [Doorbell Buzzes]</i>

481
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:40,736
Who's that?
Look, I'll see you later. All right? Bye.

482
00:31:43,298 --> 00:31:45,535
- Hey. Are you all right?
- I need to speak to you.

483
00:31:45,602 --> 00:31:49,279
Well, I wish you'd called first. I'm expecting
some guys over for a conference call.

484
00:31:49,346 --> 00:31:51,234
<i>I'm having bad thoughts.</i>

485
00:31:51,298 --> 00:31:53,153
What kind of bad thoughts?

486
00:31:55,554 --> 00:31:57,409
We did a terrible thing, lan.

487
00:31:57,474 --> 00:32:01,566
<i>- Oh, Jesus, can you just get past it?
- I'm trying.</i>

488
00:32:01,635 --> 00:32:05,344
<i>- I should never have let you talk me into it.
- I didn't.</i>

489
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:09,087
Terry, you needed his help.
Loan sharks were gonna break your legs...

490
00:32:09,154 --> 00:32:11,009
and maybe even Kate's as well.

491
00:32:11,075 --> 00:32:13,660
But Martin Burns...

492
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:16,730
we stepped on him
like he was an insect.

493
00:32:16,803 --> 00:32:18,908
Look, Terry,
I can't discuss this now.

494
00:32:18,979 --> 00:32:22,908
I've got two guys and a transatlantic
conference call coming up.

495
00:32:22,979 --> 00:32:25,499
I can't go on like this.

496
00:32:25,571 --> 00:32:28,124
Let's talk about it later.
Why aren't you at the garage?

497
00:32:28,194 --> 00:32:30,431
<i>- I got let go.
- What does that mean?</i>

498
00:32:30,499 --> 00:32:36,097
[Mutters] The boss said,
uh, l-I should take some time off.

499
00:32:36,164 --> 00:32:39,295
He thinks I've been under a lot of strain
lately. Thanks for denting theJaguar.

500
00:32:39,363 --> 00:32:42,680
<i>Oh, I'm sorry.
I forgot to tell you.</i>

501
00:32:42,756 --> 00:32:46,334
Look. You've gotta relax. All right?

502
00:32:46,404 --> 00:32:48,508
Lay off the booze and the pills.

503
00:32:48,579 --> 00:32:50,434
No wonder you're
getting yourself in trouble.

504
00:32:50,499 --> 00:32:52,442
<i>- I can't get through the day without drinking.
- [Doorbell Buzzes]</i>

505
00:32:52,515 --> 00:32:55,385
Look, you've got to go home.
All right? Rest up.

506
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:57,794
I'll call you later,
we'll get together, all right?

507
00:32:57,859 --> 00:33:00,249
You've gotta ease up.
You'll give yourself a bloody heart attack.

508
00:33:00,323 --> 00:33:02,211
Then I'll die. So I'll die.

509
00:33:02,276 --> 00:33:04,960
Don't talk like that.
What's the matter with you?

510
00:33:06,564 --> 00:33:08,604
- Guys, come in, please.
- Lovely.

511
00:33:10,372 --> 00:33:13,371
Look, I'll call you later.
I'm gonna get you past this, okay?

512
00:33:13,444 --> 00:33:15,484
All right.

513
00:33:23,684 --> 00:33:25,921
See, this is more like it,
Terry, isn't it?

514
00:33:25,988 --> 00:33:27,843
Getting out of the house.

515
00:33:27,908 --> 00:33:32,098
Can't sit around there too much.
Too much thinking.

516
00:33:32,165 --> 00:33:35,033
Kate said you're not even
talking about poker anymore.

517
00:33:35,108 --> 00:33:36,963
Where's our old Terry?

518
00:33:37,028 --> 00:33:39,265
- I mean, you're a gambler. This is you.
- Yeah.

519
00:33:39,332 --> 00:33:41,405
I'm not suggesting you
go mad or anything, but-

520
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:43,713
I'm not the same Terry, lan.

521
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:46,715
- I can't be anymore.
- No, you just have to focus.

522
00:33:46,789 --> 00:33:48,894
Look, l-I been thinking
that you getting the sack...

523
00:33:48,965 --> 00:33:51,137
- is maybe the best thing
that ever happened to you.
- What?

524
00:33:51,205 --> 00:33:55,198
Yeah. Now is the perfect time to start
thinking about setting up the sport shop.

525
00:33:55,269 --> 00:33:59,262
I mean, Uncle Howard said he would
start you off. You'd be your own boss.

526
00:33:59,332 --> 00:34:03,740
- No more kowtowing to superiors.
And you love sports.
- I do.

527
00:34:03,813 --> 00:34:07,294
Maybe you're right, lan.
Maybe what I need is just a big change.

528
00:34:07,366 --> 00:34:10,399
Yeah, you need to focus on something
substantial. You can't just do nothing.

529
00:34:10,469 --> 00:34:12,379
- Yeah.
- Hey?

530
00:34:12,454 --> 00:34:14,309
I think I'll do it, lan.

531
00:34:14,374 --> 00:34:17,243
<i>- Yeah, it's just exactly what you need, Terry.
- [Bell Rings]</i>

532
00:34:17,318 --> 00:34:21,508
<i>Get off the booze and the pills
and set up your own place.</i>

533
00:34:21,573 --> 00:34:23,482
Right, and not just sporting goods.

534
00:34:23,557 --> 00:34:25,412
Exercise equipment.

535
00:34:25,477 --> 00:34:27,332
- That's where the money is today.
- Yeah?

536
00:34:27,397 --> 00:34:30,212
Yeah. Helping people set up
their own private gyms and stuff.

537
00:34:30,278 --> 00:34:32,132
I like the way
you're thinking, Terry.

538
00:34:32,198 --> 00:34:34,915
- 'Cause you're thinking forwards.
You're not lookin' back.
- That's right.

539
00:34:34,982 --> 00:34:36,837
- You've got a really good future, Terry.
- Yeah?

540
00:34:36,902 --> 00:34:40,001
You do. Listen, I'm not saying
that I haven't had moments...

541
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:42,622
where I've thought about what we've done,
and it's freaked me out.

542
00:34:42,693 --> 00:34:44,603
- Go on!
- We were raised to know right from wrong.

543
00:34:44,678 --> 00:34:46,532
- Go on!
- Did you get that one?

544
00:34:46,598 --> 00:34:49,445
Look at this.
I got a winner.

545
00:34:49,509 --> 00:34:51,965
It's the beginning
of a new streak, Terry.

546
00:34:52,038 --> 00:34:53,893
I can feel it, lan.

547
00:34:57,542 --> 00:35:00,706
Could-Could you get this model
with the same interior in a left-hand drive...

548
00:35:00,774 --> 00:35:04,122
- say, in California, for instance?
- For California. Yeah, certainly.

549
00:35:04,198 --> 00:35:06,053
And would there be
a long waiting list or-

550
00:35:06,118 --> 00:35:07,973
I would think about
three or four months.

551
00:35:08,038 --> 00:35:10,427
- Oh, can I?
- Please do.

552
00:35:14,534 --> 00:35:17,382
[Chattering]

553
00:35:23,303 --> 00:35:27,231
Hey, great scene.
You really nailed it.

554
00:35:27,302 --> 00:35:30,597
- You were great. You were great tonight.
- Do you think so?

555
00:35:31,719 --> 00:35:35,014
The bedroom scenes
were so sexy as always.

556
00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:38,691
Well, I was doing it with him,
but I was thinking of you for motivation.

557
00:35:42,183 --> 00:35:45,479
Don't forget. Tomorrow is Lord Eisley's party.
He's invited the whole cast.

558
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:47,682
Yeah. I'm gonna keep
my eye on you like a hawk.

559
00:35:47,752 --> 00:35:51,646
You know, his son's a notorious playboy, and
I think he's asked everyone just to get you there.

560
00:35:51,719 --> 00:35:54,108
- Uh, what's that?
- Nothing.

561
00:35:54,183 --> 00:35:57,478
- [Chuckles] Show me.
- I got you these. Remember?
You liked them in the shop.

562
00:35:57,543 --> 00:36:01,373
<i>- Oh, my God. They must have cost you a fortune.
- [Cell Phone Ringing]</i>

563
00:36:03,464 --> 00:36:06,628
- Hello?
- I need to speak to you, lan.

564
00:36:08,232 --> 00:36:11,580
Kate, Kate, Kate, calm down.
What's the matter?

565
00:36:11,656 --> 00:36:14,972
It's Terry. I really need to speak to you.

566
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:16,739
What, now?

567
00:36:16,808 --> 00:36:18,783
Yeah, now. Is it possible?

568
00:36:19,784 --> 00:36:22,086
Well, look,
I'll see what I can do.

569
00:36:22,152 --> 00:36:24,007
I'll call you back,
all right?

570
00:36:24,072 --> 00:36:28,098
- Is everything all right?
- Angela, I have to go to my brother's for a while.

571
00:36:28,168 --> 00:36:30,405
- There's a little family problem.
- It's nothing serious, I hope.

572
00:36:30,472 --> 00:36:32,480
No. That was Kate.
You remember? You met her.

573
00:36:32,552 --> 00:36:35,366
It's just something's come up.
I'll see you back at yours in a while.

574
00:36:35,432 --> 00:36:39,109
Well, hurry. I want to show you
my gratitude for the earrings.

575
00:36:40,584 --> 00:36:43,967
All right. See you later, all right?

576
00:36:45,705 --> 00:36:47,560
I'm worried about Terry, lan.

577
00:36:47,625 --> 00:36:49,665
What's the matter?

578
00:36:49,737 --> 00:36:51,592
It's his mental health.

579
00:36:51,657 --> 00:36:54,024
No, I know he was worried
about losing his job...

580
00:36:54,089 --> 00:36:57,569
but we were just at the racetrack,
and he talked about starting the sport shop.

581
00:36:57,641 --> 00:37:00,008
<i>No, he's not
interested in that.</i>

582
00:37:00,072 --> 00:37:01,927
And now he's angry all the time.

583
00:37:01,992 --> 00:37:04,381
- He's talking to himself, for God's sake.
- No, we decided.

584
00:37:04,457 --> 00:37:08,003
He was gonna speak to Uncle Howard
about bankrolling it. He was very excited.

585
00:37:08,073 --> 00:37:10,244
His mind's not right, lan.

586
00:37:10,313 --> 00:37:12,615
You know, what he says one minute
doesn't mean anything the next.

587
00:37:12,681 --> 00:37:15,748
Right. Well, I'm- I'm taken aback.

588
00:37:15,818 --> 00:37:18,534
It's all the pills he's taking,
and the drinking.

589
00:37:18,601 --> 00:37:21,023
He thinks
he's killed someone.

590
00:37:23,945 --> 00:37:25,374
<i>- What?
- Yeah.</i>

591
00:37:25,449 --> 00:37:28,832
You know, I knew this girl once,
she had, like, mental problems.

592
00:37:28,905 --> 00:37:31,524
She was convinced that
she had run someone over. She hadn't.

593
00:37:31,594 --> 00:37:34,409
You know, but she was obsessed
with it for the rest of her life.

594
00:37:34,474 --> 00:37:37,540
Does he, uh-
Is he going around...

595
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:41,919
talking- talking
about this, uh, murder?

596
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:45,671
<i>He's gotten worse and worse.
He has these terrible nightmares.</i>

597
00:37:45,738 --> 00:37:48,738
He's uncommunicative,
face of doom all the time, bouts of crying.

598
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:51,712
When we were at the dog track,
he seemed to have come out of it.

599
00:37:51,786 --> 00:37:54,819
When he come home,
he was straight back in it.

600
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:58,884
You know, it's just- it's obsession
that he's done this horrible thing.

601
00:37:58,954 --> 00:38:01,027
And he- he won't
let me get a doctor.

602
00:38:01,099 --> 00:38:04,033
No, no, don't do that.
Don't-Don't get a doctor.

603
00:38:04,105 --> 00:38:08,230
If you get a doctor,
then it can- I'll deal with this.

604
00:38:08,298 --> 00:38:11,494
- Well, how?
- Well, obviously, it's a bit
more serious than I thought...

605
00:38:11,562 --> 00:38:15,785
but... if you get a doctor,
it could spiral out of control.

606
00:38:15,851 --> 00:38:18,568
- I really think he should see a doctor.
- Don't get a doctor, Kate. Don't.

607
00:38:18,635 --> 00:38:22,792
Because I know Terry, and it will
only make things worse. All right?

608
00:38:22,859 --> 00:38:26,687
Just- I'm gonna be
in the countryside tomorrow, all right?

609
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:29,632
And then when I come back, I'll spend
some time with Terry, and it'll be-

610
00:38:29,706 --> 00:38:31,561
You'll see. It'll be all right.

611
00:38:31,626 --> 00:38:33,830
Well, where you gonna be
if I need you though?

612
00:38:33,898 --> 00:38:36,037
I'll let you know my whereabouts,
then you can call me.

613
00:38:36,107 --> 00:38:38,278
I'll come-
I'll come straight back.

614
00:38:41,099 --> 00:38:44,066
- So you're a fan of the Greek tragedies too?
- Love them. Crazy about them.

615
00:38:44,139 --> 00:38:46,856
It's just rare that I could ever
get the chance to act in one.

616
00:38:46,924 --> 00:38:49,224
God, I know. It's difficult, isn't it?
Which is your favorite, lan?

617
00:38:49,291 --> 00:38:51,680
Oh, I'm not really
that-that familiar.

618
00:38:51,755 --> 00:38:54,056
<i>Oh, well. Mine's always been Medea,
Euripides.</i>

619
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:58,051
Yeah, me too. I think Clytemnestra's
probably the best character...

620
00:38:58,123 --> 00:38:59,978
- of all classical plays.
- Yeah.

621
00:39:00,043 --> 00:39:02,378
I have to say, the best productions
of Greek myths I've ever seen-

622
00:39:02,444 --> 00:39:04,615
better than anything you'll find
on the stage-was done in dance...

623
00:39:04,683 --> 00:39:06,822
- by the Martha Graham troupe, you know them?
- Really?

624
00:39:06,892 --> 00:39:10,023
Yeah. I mean, all the terror was there,
all the Aristotelian pity and fear.

625
00:39:10,092 --> 00:39:13,058
- It's so much more visceral
in dance, don't you think?
- Right.

626
00:39:13,131 --> 00:39:15,400
- Mr. Blaine? Your brother's here.
- Yeah?

627
00:39:15,467 --> 00:39:17,322
- What?
- He'd like to see you.

628
00:39:17,387 --> 00:39:20,649
Oh. Uh...

629
00:39:20,716 --> 00:39:22,570
could you give me a moment?

630
00:39:22,636 --> 00:39:25,767
- Yeah, sure. Bring him in.
- It must be pretty bad if he's
driven all the way out here.

631
00:39:25,836 --> 00:39:30,212
No, l- Uh- It's just a little
family problem. I won't be long.

632
00:39:32,588 --> 00:39:34,693
- Oh, I'm sure it's nothing.
- I'm sure.

633
00:39:36,299 --> 00:39:38,536
- Your brother's there, Mr. Blaine.
- Thanks.

634
00:39:46,316 --> 00:39:50,571
Terry, what are you doing here?
How did you know where I was?

635
00:39:50,637 --> 00:39:52,492
Kate had the address.

636
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:55,372
- I need to tell you something.
- Well, just keep your voice down.

637
00:39:55,437 --> 00:39:58,785
I don't want anyone overhearing.
Why didn't you just give me a phone?

638
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:01,544
- I want to turn myself in, lan.
- What?

639
00:40:01,613 --> 00:40:03,784
- We broke God's law.
- God?

640
00:40:03,852 --> 00:40:07,365
Terry, what God?
What God, you idiot?

641
00:40:07,436 --> 00:40:09,291
I shouldn't have let you
talk me into it.

642
00:40:09,356 --> 00:40:13,131
- I didn't talk you into it. Stop deluding yourself.
- I want this off my neck.

643
00:40:13,197 --> 00:40:15,618
Look, you can't do this,
Terry, all right?

644
00:40:15,693 --> 00:40:19,271
You can't do it. You'd be throwing your whole
life away, and mine and Uncle Howard's.

645
00:40:19,341 --> 00:40:21,992
I won't implicate
you and Howard.

646
00:40:23,021 --> 00:40:24,876
- You won't-
- This is my personal decision.

647
00:40:24,941 --> 00:40:27,243
- You won't be able to keep us out of it.
- I will.

648
00:40:27,309 --> 00:40:29,164
No, you're upset.
You're unstable.

649
00:40:29,229 --> 00:40:31,084
Your lies will be all transparent.

650
00:40:31,149 --> 00:40:33,899
- I've thought about suicide, lan.
- But why?

651
00:40:33,965 --> 00:40:35,820
Stop asking the same
questions over and over.

652
00:40:35,885 --> 00:40:38,274
Go and commit suicide,
and leave Howard and me out of it.

653
00:40:38,349 --> 00:40:41,545
I just want the slate wiped clean.

654
00:40:41,613 --> 00:40:43,850
Look. You're depressed.

655
00:40:43,917 --> 00:40:46,568
You're just suffering
from a little depression, that's all.

656
00:40:46,637 --> 00:40:50,466
- Kate wants me to see a doctor.
- No, no. Look, I can help you. If you'll just let me.

657
00:40:50,541 --> 00:40:55,331
I just want to tell someone. Go in
and serve my punishment. Have it off me.

658
00:40:55,406 --> 00:41:00,359
Just give me a minute. Give me a minute
to get my thoughts in order, will you?

659
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:04,171
I wish you could come with me.
But if you won't, I understand.

660
00:41:04,237 --> 00:41:07,139
Just give me a minute.

661
00:41:07,213 --> 00:41:10,213
<i>- I feel less panic since I made this decision.
- Hi.</i>

662
00:41:10,285 --> 00:41:13,634
You okay?
Are you gonna join us?

663
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:17,453
Terry and I are just discussing a little problem.
Everything will be all right.

664
00:41:17,518 --> 00:41:19,820
<i>Just had to talk
to lan about something.</i>

665
00:41:19,886 --> 00:41:21,741
- You sure?
- Yes.

666
00:41:21,806 --> 00:41:24,359
You go on, I'll only be a minute.

667
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:26,284
Okay.

668
00:41:30,126 --> 00:41:34,087
- She's very beautiful.
She'd make a great wife for you.
- Look, Terry.

669
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:36,362
Terry, listen to me.
I want to help you. I do.

670
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:38,285
But this is not
the time or the place.

671
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:40,456
- I'm sorry for barging in.
- No, no, it's all right. It's all right.

672
00:41:40,527 --> 00:41:43,789
Look, I want to hear what you've got to say.
We're family. You're my brother.

673
00:41:43,855 --> 00:41:46,059
Yeah, we can talk, but you're
not gonna change my mind.

674
00:41:46,127 --> 00:41:51,145
Maybe not. Maybe not. Maybe you'll even
change mine. But just promise me one thing.

675
00:41:51,214 --> 00:41:54,313
We've gotta have a discussion
about this before you plunge ahead.

676
00:41:54,383 --> 00:41:56,805
- Promise?
- Promise. Can I come in and get a drink?

677
00:41:56,878 --> 00:41:58,733
No, that's not a good idea.

678
00:41:58,799 --> 00:42:02,246
- You go. I'll give you a call tonight.
- Right.

679
00:42:06,287 --> 00:42:08,262
Call me tonight.

680
00:42:28,624 --> 00:42:31,307
I just don't see any alternative.

681
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:34,663
What are we saying?

682
00:42:34,735 --> 00:42:40,103
Well, I don't know what we're saying.
We're-We're saying we want to survive.

683
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:43,338
But he's family.

684
00:42:43,407 --> 00:42:45,295
Terry. He's my brother.

685
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:47,215
<i>Well, l-I know that.</i>

686
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:52,550
<i>But he has to be stopped before he-
this whole thing unravels.</i>

687
00:42:52,624 --> 00:42:55,013
Yeah, I can't-
I can't let that happen.

688
00:42:55,088 --> 00:42:56,975
No.

689
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,342
No, l-

690
00:42:59,408 --> 00:43:01,579
It's killing again.

691
00:43:01,647 --> 00:43:03,982
How am I gonna do that?

692
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,593
<i>It's deja vu,
but a thousand times worse.</i>

693
00:43:07,664 --> 00:43:09,519
<i>Speed is of the essence.</i>

694
00:43:09,584 --> 00:43:13,862
Terry could be doing something awful
while we sit here and curse our fate.

695
00:43:13,936 --> 00:43:17,035
He was right about one thing.

696
00:43:17,104 --> 00:43:20,103
It was like crossing a line.

697
00:43:20,176 --> 00:43:22,184
There was no way back.

698
00:43:23,248 --> 00:43:25,965
It has to be made
to look like an accident.

699
00:43:26,033 --> 00:43:31,084
<i>Yeah. Yeah,
an accident or a suicide.</i>

700
00:43:33,361 --> 00:43:35,434
Well, he just broods.

701
00:43:35,505 --> 00:43:38,538
You know, he sits there
talking to himself.

702
00:43:38,609 --> 00:43:42,056
He imagines that you and him
have got some dark secret.

703
00:43:42,128 --> 00:43:44,747
You know, that you've
harmed someone or something.

704
00:43:45,777 --> 00:43:48,265
Lan, I think
he's gonna hurt himself.

705
00:43:51,473 --> 00:43:53,928
Let me be alone
with him, Kate.

706
00:43:54,001 --> 00:43:55,856
Yeah.

707
00:44:14,161 --> 00:44:16,103
Terry.

708
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:23,374
- Terry.
- I had a dream about Martin Burns.

709
00:44:37,139 --> 00:44:39,528
Terry, listen to me.

710
00:44:39,602 --> 00:44:41,806
I dreamed again...

711
00:44:41,875 --> 00:44:43,729
about Martin Burns.

712
00:44:44,819 --> 00:44:47,208
You need a couple of days
away from all this.

713
00:44:48,338 --> 00:44:52,168
Get some fresh air,
some sea air...

714
00:44:52,242 --> 00:44:54,185
just the two of us.

715
00:44:54,258 --> 00:44:56,812
We'll go out on the boat
again tomorrow.

716
00:44:56,883 --> 00:44:59,785
- We never go sailing anymore, lan.
- That's what I'm saying.

717
00:45:01,042 --> 00:45:04,359
We'll take some sandwiches
and some beers...

718
00:45:04,435 --> 00:45:08,843
and we'll just talk,
brother to brother.

719
00:45:08,915 --> 00:45:10,802
I'd like that.

720
00:45:11,762 --> 00:45:14,151
I wish you could see
my point of view.

721
00:45:14,226 --> 00:45:18,601
It'll be great.
Just the two of us.

722
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:24,306
I think Angela said she was
taking Kate shopping tomorrow.

723
00:45:24,371 --> 00:45:28,049
- She said she was gonna
help her out with her style.
- Yeah.

724
00:45:28,116 --> 00:45:30,287
And we'll just relax, yeah?

725
00:45:30,355 --> 00:45:33,867
Get some sun.
Maybe we can have a swim.

726
00:45:33,938 --> 00:45:36,044
You'll feel so much better
when you've had some sea air.

727
00:45:36,115 --> 00:45:39,115
Yeah, but we'll never
be our old selves again, lan, right?

728
00:45:39,187 --> 00:45:41,423
I mean, there's no going back.

729
00:45:43,828 --> 00:45:47,603
Go and tell Kate that
we're going out sailing tomorrow.

730
00:45:47,668 --> 00:45:49,261
- Right.
- Yeah.

731
00:45:49,332 --> 00:45:51,187
- Okay.
- Come on.

732
00:45:53,396 --> 00:45:57,868
<i>Kate, I've got
something to tell you.</i>

733
00:45:57,939 --> 00:46:00,012
<i>We're going sailing tomorrow.</i>

734
00:46:00,084 --> 00:46:03,280
<i>Yeah, just the two of us.
Lan's gonna take me out on the boat.</i>

735
00:46:35,732 --> 00:46:37,587
So, did Terry tell you the good news?

736
00:46:37,652 --> 00:46:40,238
Yeah, it's a wonderful idea.

737
00:46:40,308 --> 00:46:44,051
'Cause you two never really got the chance
to spend much time on your boat, did you?

738
00:46:44,116 --> 00:46:46,866
- And you were so excited when you first bought it.
- Yeah.

739
00:46:46,933 --> 00:46:49,104
I told lan about Angela taking you
shopping tomorrow as well.

740
00:46:49,172 --> 00:46:51,441
Oh, yeah. She's so nice.

741
00:46:55,733 --> 00:46:58,995
Mike Eisley from the garden party
asked if we were serious.

742
00:46:59,062 --> 00:47:04,462
- And then he invited me
to Morocco for the weekend.
- And what did you say?

743
00:47:04,532 --> 00:47:07,402
Well, I told him that I loved you.

744
00:47:07,477 --> 00:47:11,667
For the first time in my life,
those words actually had meaning.

745
00:47:11,733 --> 00:47:13,675
I love you.

746
00:47:15,030 --> 00:47:16,885
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

747
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:21,457
- You seem a bit distracted.
- No, I'm just thinking about what you're saying.

748
00:47:21,526 --> 00:47:23,598
And I'm tired, you know.

749
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:26,669
Well, you have been
working really hard recently.

750
00:47:27,797 --> 00:47:29,739
I think taking your boat
out with your brother...

751
00:47:29,813 --> 00:47:32,977
will do you just
as much good as him.

752
00:47:33,045 --> 00:47:36,275
- Is he all right?
- He's depressed.

753
00:47:36,342 --> 00:47:40,084
He drinks too much
and he's getting sullen, and-

754
00:47:40,149 --> 00:47:42,124
Kate's worried that
he might hurt himself.

755
00:47:42,198 --> 00:47:44,565
Well, maybe he-
Well, he should go to a doctor then.

756
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:47,052
No, he resists. He resists.

757
00:47:47,126 --> 00:47:51,119
I didn't tell Kate this,
but he's talked of suicide.

758
00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:53,611
Oh, my God.

759
00:47:55,766 --> 00:47:58,286
- I'm so sorry. That's awful.
- I know.

760
00:49:45,592 --> 00:49:48,211
Best thing we ever did,
getting this boat, Terry, isn't it?

761
00:49:48,281 --> 00:49:50,386
Eh?

762
00:49:50,457 --> 00:49:53,457
Kate's right. We don't get out on it
as often as we should.

763
00:49:53,529 --> 00:49:55,384
It's sad how things
turned out, isn't it?

764
00:49:55,449 --> 00:49:58,962
- Don't start, Terry.
- No, I mean it, lan.

765
00:49:59,033 --> 00:50:00,888
We made the wrong decision.

766
00:50:00,953 --> 00:50:03,473
The way I see it,
we didn't have much choice.

767
00:50:03,545 --> 00:50:05,847
You always have choice, lan.

768
00:50:05,913 --> 00:50:08,630
I see that now.

769
00:50:08,697 --> 00:50:10,552
I mean, l- I didn't at first.

770
00:50:10,617 --> 00:50:15,025
I thought... like you,
that we had no choice, but-

771
00:50:15,097 --> 00:50:17,519
All right, let's say that you're right-
which I'm not saying-

772
00:50:17,593 --> 00:50:19,448
but let's say for
the sake of argument...

773
00:50:19,513 --> 00:50:22,709
- that we did make the wrong choice.
- For the sake of argument?

774
00:50:23,994 --> 00:50:25,848
You really fool yourself,
lan, don't you?

775
00:50:25,913 --> 00:50:29,262
His testimony was gonna put Uncle Howard
in prison for the rest of his life.

776
00:50:29,337 --> 00:50:31,192
Well, maybe Uncle Howard
deserves to go to jail.

777
00:50:31,257 --> 00:50:34,640
Oh, what a thing to say.
Forget it.

778
00:50:34,714 --> 00:50:40,148
Christ, you think we've committed
some kind of unnatural act, but we haven't.

779
00:50:40,218 --> 00:50:43,088
The whole of human life
is about violence.

780
00:50:43,161 --> 00:50:45,747
It's a cruel world, Terry.

781
00:50:45,818 --> 00:50:47,825
You're just shaken up
because you've come-

782
00:50:47,897 --> 00:50:51,061
you've come face-to-face
with your own human nature.

783
00:50:53,625 --> 00:50:57,368
L-I mean,
I didn't have to do it.

784
00:50:57,434 --> 00:50:59,801
Well, why did you then?

785
00:50:59,866 --> 00:51:05,169
I just kept going, like- like when
I gamble over my head, you know?

786
00:51:05,242 --> 00:51:07,544
I just put the bet down
like when I'm in a dream.

787
00:51:07,611 --> 00:51:09,651
You weren't dreaming
when you shot him.

788
00:51:11,834 --> 00:51:13,743
All right. Look, listen.

789
00:51:13,818 --> 00:51:16,207
We made a mistake, right? But it's over.

790
00:51:16,282 --> 00:51:18,835
All right? We made the wrong choice.
I'm giving you that...

791
00:51:18,906 --> 00:51:22,038
but being punished
by it won't undo it.

792
00:51:22,107 --> 00:51:24,976
Martin Burns is dead.
He's dead.

793
00:51:35,707 --> 00:51:37,562
I called the police last night.

794
00:51:38,971 --> 00:51:41,360
You did what?

795
00:51:41,434 --> 00:51:45,428
I called them and I told them I had
information on the murder of Martin Burns.

796
00:51:45,499 --> 00:51:47,354
They said,
"Who is it?"

797
00:51:47,419 --> 00:51:52,471
I wanted to tell them...
who I was, but I didn't.

798
00:51:53,467 --> 00:51:55,638
Hung up.

799
00:51:55,707 --> 00:51:58,195
I'm gonna call them
as soon as I get back, lan.

800
00:51:58,267 --> 00:52:00,755
Why would you do that?

801
00:52:00,827 --> 00:52:05,017
What's the matter with you?
It's suicide, Terry.

802
00:52:05,083 --> 00:52:09,077
Don't you even care that you're gonna take
Uncle Howard and me with you?

803
00:52:09,148 --> 00:52:12,443
It's the order of things,
lan. It's off kilter. Can't you see it?

804
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,955
I have to straighten it out.

805
00:52:16,028 --> 00:52:20,697
All right. I don't wanna
talk about this anymore.

806
00:52:20,763 --> 00:52:23,763
We came out here just to relax, didn't we?
Just to sail and unwind, eh?

807
00:52:23,835 --> 00:52:26,486
Yeah.

808
00:52:26,555 --> 00:52:29,752
- I'm just gonna get us some more beers, all right?
- All right.

809
00:53:48,477 --> 00:53:51,674
- Why couldn't you just let it go?
Why couldn't you let it go?
- Lan, what's wrong?

810
00:53:51,741 --> 00:53:53,650
- You've ruined everything, Terry.
- Lan, what's wrong?

811
00:53:53,725 --> 00:53:56,278
Terry, you've ruined it!
You've ruined everything!

812
00:53:56,349 --> 00:53:59,732
- Lan, stop!
- We could've had everything!

813
00:54:03,742 --> 00:54:05,881
Lan. Lan.

814
00:54:06,846 --> 00:54:08,886
Lan. Lan.

815
00:54:09,854 --> 00:54:12,407
Lan.

816
00:54:14,558 --> 00:54:16,413
Lan!

817
00:54:17,405 --> 00:54:19,544
Oh, God.

818
00:54:24,671 --> 00:54:26,558
God.

819
00:54:33,054 --> 00:54:35,771
What we think happened,
but we don't know for sure...

820
00:54:35,837 --> 00:54:38,772
one killed the other,
either on purpose or by accident...

821
00:54:38,846 --> 00:54:42,621
and then took his own life,
drowned himself.

822
00:54:42,686 --> 00:54:44,890
Awful.

823
00:54:44,959 --> 00:54:47,741
The place reeks of booze and pills.

824
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:50,742
I don't know.
Every day, it's something else.

825
00:54:56,958 --> 00:54:59,958
Oh, I like that.

826
00:55:00,031 --> 00:55:01,886
- What do you think?
- Yeah.

827
00:55:01,951 --> 00:55:03,806
- I would look good in that.
- Yeah, Terry would love that.

828
00:55:03,871 --> 00:55:06,260
- Would he?
- Yeah, men love that sort of shape.

829
00:55:06,335 --> 00:55:09,302
I wore something similar
when lan first saw me.

830
