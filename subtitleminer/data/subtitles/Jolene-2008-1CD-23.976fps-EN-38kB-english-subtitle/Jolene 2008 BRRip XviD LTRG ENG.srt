1
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,322
I married Mickey Holler
when I was 15.

2
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:17,951
He was 20 years old, Mickey...
real name, Mervin.

3
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,912
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

4
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:21,246
Are you happy, baby?

5
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,040
Oh, sure I am, Mickey.

6
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:28,337
Welcome to the family, pumpkin.

7
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:29,463
Mm.

8
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:31,256
It sure is gonna be nice
having you around

9
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:32,800
with my knuckleheaded
nephew here.

10
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,343
- You did good, bub.
- Yeah.

11
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,261
If your mama were alive today,
she'd be proud of you, too.

12
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:37,846
Congratulations.

13
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:40,265
I sincerely hope it works out
for the both of y'all.

14
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:41,225
Thank you!

15
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:45,187
Yeah!

16
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,940
Hold on. Don't fall, baby.

17
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:49,274
Get on my back.

18
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,401
I came from a series
of foster homes,

19
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:53,946
where my so-called "daddies"
would end up fooling with me.

20
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:54,613
Here we go!

21
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:58,575
My foster moms would beat me
for no reason...

22
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:01,411
and every reason...

23
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:04,623
so I married Mickey.

24
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:06,875
I'll see you later, Uncle Phil.

25
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:09,503
Thanks, Aunt Kay.

26
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:12,047
Bye.

27
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:14,967
Mickey seemed
like a dream come true.

28
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:17,177
All I ever had to do
was say what I wanted,

29
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:18,178
like go to a movie

30
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:21,056
or get a grilled-cheese sandwich
with a chocolate shake,

31
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:23,976
and it became
his whole purpose in life.

32
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,522
Uncle Phil's gonna give me
some more routes soon.

33
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:31,859
I was thinking that, you know,
when you finish schooI

34
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,569
and we save up some money,
in a few years,

35
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:35,863
we should start to think
about getting a place of our own.

36
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,072
In a few years?

37
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:38,198
Well, yeah.

38
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:40,159
I mean, Uncle Phil and Aunt Kay
don't mind.

39
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:41,869
I mean, you are family now.

40
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,662
Well, I know.

41
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:44,913
It was just...

42
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,957
I was kind of hoping
we could get our own place,

43
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,792
like, in a few months.

44
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:51,336
Well, hey, my baby
wants a place of her own,

45
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:54,006
my baby's gonna get
a place of her own...

46
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,215
in a few months.

47
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:56,967
Really, Mickey?

48
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:58,260
Yes, Ma'am!

49
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:00,470
You don't gotta worry
about nothin' no more.

50
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,098
He loved me...
and that was a plus.

51
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:07,311
Even if he didn't know
much about it.

52
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:15,027
# I was a wild-eyed, skirt-chasin' #

53
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,905
# Love-takin' troublemaker #

54
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:24,411
# Built Ford tough,
every square inch a hell-raiser #

55
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,915
# The bar-room king of this town #

56
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,041
# And then... #

57
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:41,970
# Baby, babe #

58
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:44,223
Hey, hey, everybody!

59
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:46,934
# Here comes the bride #

60
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,602
# All dressed in white #

61
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:50,562
Mm.

62
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:53,190
Ain't she just the prettiest thing
you ever seen?

63
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:55,317
My, my.

64
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:59,446
Mickey Holler, I think you've got
horseshoes up your ass.

65
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,073
That's for sure.

66
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,659
I'm the luckiest guy alive.

67
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:04,868
I'll say.

68
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:06,078
Excuse us.

69
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:07,412
Mick, I hate to break this to you,

70
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:08,956
knowing it's your weddin' day
and all,

71
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,666
but we're a little shorthanded
tomorrow.

72
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,501
I'm gonna have to have you
fill in for Leroy.

73
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,127
- What?
- Yeah. His mama died.

74
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,504
Tomorrow?! Well, shit!

75
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,006
Hey, you're a married man now.
You have a wife to support.

76
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:19,841
I know, but, Uncle Phil, come on!

77
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,718
- Are you a man?
- I...

78
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:24,888
Mick, are you a man,
or are you a mouse?

79
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:27,182
I... uh...

80
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:28,058
Mick.

81
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,268
Philip!

82
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,061
Yes, dear?

83
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,272
Burgers... they're on fire.

84
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,691
Oh, shit.

85
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,779
Well...

86
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:43,073
This will be your new home...

87
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,908
for now.

88
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:45,575
Mm.

89
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,452
There's spare sheets and blankets
in the closet.

90
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:49,454
Towels are in the bathroom
under the sink.

91
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,414
Thank you, Ma'am.

92
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:52,874
Do you know how to cook?

93
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:55,335
Oh, of course, Aunt Kay.

94
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,967
I'm not your aunt, Jolene.

95
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:04,553
Please, call me by my name... Kay.

96
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:08,140
Of course, Kay.

97
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,146
Mickey, I don't think
your aunt likes me.

98
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:16,189
Hey! How can you say that?

99
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,400
Uncle PhiI and Aunt Kay,
they think you're real special.

100
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:20,319
And you're my wife, for chrissakes!

101
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:36,626
Hold on!

102
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:39,755
Give your husband a kiss good-bye.

103
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,134
Now go learn something for me...

104
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,094
...and teach it to me later.

105
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,180
Okay.

106
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:01,109
So, what do you think?

107
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:03,653
I don't like it.

108
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,821
It doesn't seem real.

109
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:07,741
Then try drawing
what you've seen or experienced.

110
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,785
Most of the things I've seen,
I'd never want to draw.

111
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,370
Then draw the rest.

112
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,332
Okay. I'll try.

113
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,085
You have talent, Jolene.

114
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:21,505
It'll come to you, if you let it.

115
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:33,850
Great meal, Jolene.

116
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,352
Yes sirree.

117
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:37,854
Ain't she a peach?

118
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,190
What is that special sauce on top?

119
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,901
Well, whatever it is,
it sure is gourmet-like.

120
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,739
Where did you learn how to cook?

121
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:49,533
I taught myself.

122
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:52,160
Well, you don't need to learn
anything more about meatloaf, sugar.

123
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:55,872
It's gourmet-like.

124
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:58,625
Thanks, but I got to save
some room for dessert.

125
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:01,336
Oh. I'm sorry.

126
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:03,046
I- I didn't make any dessert.

127
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,714
That meatloaf was so sweet-tasting,

128
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,092
it was like having dessert
and dinner all rolled into one.

129
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,719
Maybe you could think
about making a-a salad

130
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,138
or a vegetable next time.

131
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,889
Well, if you're still hungry,
Aunt Kay,

132
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:14,850
we can run out
and get you some ice cream.

133
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:16,476
No, thank you, Mickey.
I'm full.

134
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:19,938
Anyway, don't forget
to clean up, okay?

135
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:22,524
Oh. If you want, Kay,
I can make you a sandwich.

136
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,068
Oh, my.

137
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:30,907
Maybe she should do
her own damn cooking.

138
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,744
It wasn't that bad, was it?

139
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:38,373
Oh, God, no, baby.
It was great.

140
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:42,919
You almost done with that?

141
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:47,007
Yeah.

142
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:50,886
I'm tired.

143
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:53,889
Good.

144
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,599
I got somethin' for you.

145
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:58,435
Go ahead. Open it.

146
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,313
My birthday isn't till tomorrow.

147
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:04,232
I know, but... this is for tonight.

148
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,529
Gee...

149
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,740
Mickey, it's so nice!

150
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,617
I picked it out myself.

151
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,535
Aren't you gonna try it on?

152
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,874
The ladies at the store were
asking me all sorts of questions

153
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,584
about your sizes and everything.

154
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,461
And I just hope that I got it right.

155
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,715
I got it from Berman's
if you want to return it.

156
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,884
No, I like it!

157
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,725
Thanks, Mickey.

158
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,061
I'm sure I'll grow into it.

159
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,980
You look good, baby.

160
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:46,399
Real sexy.

161
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,068
Come here.

162
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,947
Oh.

163
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:56,368
I wish my ma could have met you.

164
00:08:56,494 --> 00:09:00,038
She'd love you just the same as me.

165
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,208
Mick?

166
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:05,377
Yeah?

167
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,005
How'd she die?

168
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:23,311
I don't want to talk about that
right now.

169
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,898
But I'm your wife.

170
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,484
We ought to be able
to share everything.

171
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:33,113
I know. We ought to.

172
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:36,408
I just don't want to talk
about it right now.

173
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,413
Okay.

174
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:54,968
What's the matter, Mickey?

175
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:59,723
I'm just so lucky I found you.

176
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:08,356
Happy birthday.

177
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:11,151
I'm sorry.

178
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:20,160
I love my present, Mickey.

179
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,202
Thank you.

180
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,042
Jolene?

181
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,460
Shh.

182
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:30,587
Here.

183
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,223
He had no ambition.

184
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:49,272
He no longer talked about
getting a little place of our own

185
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:50,565
or moving toward anything

186
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:53,234
that would make things different
for us than they were then.

187
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:01,201
He was a day-to-day person.

188
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,961
Wakey, wakey!

189
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:17,092
# Tonight's the night
I've been waiting for #

190
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:20,845
# Because you're not a baby #

191
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:22,514
# Anymore #

192
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:28,228
# You've turned into
the prettiest girI I've ever seen #

193
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:31,690
# Happy birthday, sweet 16 #

194
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:36,820
# Happy birthday, sweet Jolene #

195
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:39,364
Mm.

196
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:44,077
Get your skinny ass out of bed, boy!

197
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:46,287
"Boy"? Don't be callin' me that,
old man!

198
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:47,580
Hey, hey, hey.

199
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,582
Why do you gotta get
all sensitive about it?

200
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,835
I don't want you callin' me that
in front of my wife.

201
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:53,628
Huh? What?

202
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:59,092
I hate to break up
the happy little party here,

203
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,845
but, um, the kitchen floor
is an absolute mess,

204
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:04,764
and, well, being as you cooked
last night, Jolene,

205
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,183
do you think you could possibly
manage to clean it up?

206
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:09,728
Sure, Kay.
I ain't got nothin' better to do.

207
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:12,564
Oh, and, by the way, happy birthday.

208
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:18,361
Uncle PhiI was always
tryin' to show off around me,

209
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:21,448
and he gave me great big hugs...

210
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,116
that lasted way too long.

211
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,526
# Oh, everybody #

212
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:00,653
# Get on the floor #

213
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,156
# Let's dance #

214
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:08,411
# Don't fight your feelings #

215
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:11,039
# Give yourself a chance #

216
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:17,045
# Shake, shake, shake #

217
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:21,758
# Shake your booty #

218
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,593
# Oh, shake, shake, shake #

219
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:26,095
# Shake, shake, shake #

220
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:29,808
# Shake your booty #

221
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,310
# Oh, you can #

222
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,187
# You can do it #

223
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:36,189
# Very well #

224
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:43,363
# You're the best in the world #

225
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,781
# I can tell #

226
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:49,494
# Oh, shake, shake, shake #

227
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:51,454
# Shake, shake, shake #

228
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,915
# Shake your booty #

229
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,292
Happy birthday, pumpkin.

230
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:59,003
# Oh, shake, shake, shake #

231
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:00,672
# Shake, shake, shake #

232
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:05,134
# Shake your booty #

233
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,387
# Oh, oh, yeah #

234
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,225
# Shake, shake #

235
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:19,649
In my whole life,

236
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:24,362
I'd never been to where
I couldn't wait to see someone.

237
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:38,209
I tried to contain myself,
but I couldn't.

238
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,294
I don't know.

239
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,881
It was just that way with PhiI.

240
00:14:57,354 --> 00:15:00,023
It was so intense and constant,

241
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:03,359
so ever-present and undeniable

242
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:06,696
that PhiI was no longer laughing.

243
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,800
It was every day now,

244
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:12,178
and always between the hours
of when Aunt Kay left for the bank

245
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:15,431
and when Mickey
would drive her home.

246
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:17,767
Poor Mickey.

247
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:22,855
I just felt so sorry for him.

248
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:27,318
I could keeI over right now
and be perfectly fine with that.

249
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:30,822
Hey, I wouldn't be fine with that.

250
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:07,692
I think this must be one of the most
beautifuI places in the world.

251
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:13,239
See that ridge over there?

252
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:16,409
We could build a house up there.
Just you and me, pumpkin.

253
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,370
Look out over the valley every day,

254
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:21,330
and as long as you were there,

255
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,750
it would be the most beautiful place
in the world.

256
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,546
Kiss me, baby.
Let's make it real.

257
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:39,766
Stop it, Phil.

258
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,644
It hurts too bad.

259
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,313
What hurts, angel?

260
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,066
Look at me.

261
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,109
I'm looking.

262
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:55,656
Can't you understand
I'll wait for you, Phil?

263
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:58,451
However long it takes.
Even till after Kay dies.

264
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,119
That's how much I care.

265
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,706
I love every little inch of you,
Jolene,

266
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:07,794
and I'm not gonna give you up
for anything or anyone.

267
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,171
But we got to be sensitive
and careful.

268
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,678
I can be sensitive and careful.

269
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:20,098
We got to think
about Mickey and Kay.

270
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:28,689
We don't got to think
about anything right now.

271
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:45,915
Do you hear something?

272
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,417
It's probably just the TV.

273
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:52,171
No, I hear something.

274
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,715
It's something
that's very, very important.

275
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:59,137
We have, back again,
a blood-pressure monitor!

276
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:00,930
Okay, here it is.

277
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:07,687
Information not...

278
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,692
Oh! Kay!

279
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,862
You little whore!

280
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,531
You little bitch! Damn you!

281
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:27,582
You heinous little bitch!

282
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:30,626
The next time you want
to ruin someone's life,

283
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,336
make it your own!

284
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:38,342
Aah!

285
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:52,732
How could you hurt Mickey?!

286
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,151
No, no, no.
Hey! Hey! Put that down!

287
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:56,485
Put that down!

288
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:03,284
Mickey, I'm so sorry.

289
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:08,623
No, Mickey, please.

290
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:09,665
Mickey!

291
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,334
I didn't mean to hurt you!

292
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:13,753
Mickey, no!

293
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:23,471
Well, it's your damn fault!

294
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:28,517
Mickey!

295
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:15,815
Ohh!

296
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:27,034
When they told me
about Mickey, I cried for days.

297
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:33,708
I'm gonna give you a mild sedative
so you can sleep tonight.

298
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,794
You're just gonna feel
a little pinch.

299
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,046
Aah.

300
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:41,590
Now, why don't you go ahead
and lie back on down?

301
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,467
Come on.

302
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:50,099
Protective services want to see you
in the morning.

303
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:51,976
They want to talk to you
about what happened.

304
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:54,145
But it was an accident.
I told you.

305
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:55,604
I know, honey.

306
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,815
Try to get some sleep.

307
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:04,155
They put me in a moteI
by the interstate

308
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:06,782
untiI they could figure out
what to do with me.

309
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:09,827
They called me a home-wrecker,

310
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:11,954
but also a widow,

311
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,751
but also a juvenile delinquent
with no living relatives.

312
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:19,587
I guess everything they said
about me was true.

313
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:24,675
They sent a psychiatrist that worked
for the county to interview me.

314
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:26,886
Tell me your feelings about Mickey.

315
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:30,348
He loved me.

316
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:32,683
Nobody ever did before.

317
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:36,020
Did you love Mickey?

318
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:38,689
I miss him.

319
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:41,942
And Philip?

320
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:49,283
It was the double cross of all time.

321
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:52,078
He recommended I be sent
to the juvenile loony bin

322
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:56,207
until such time I was to become
a reasonable adult.

323
00:22:56,333 --> 00:23:00,169
I had told my story in all honesty,

324
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:02,755
and for that I was sent away...

325
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:06,258
...to be punished for it.

326
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:07,885
My name is Mrs. Ames,

327
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:10,137
and I'm the head nurse here
at South Sumter.

328
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:12,390
And this is Cindy.
She's your attendant.

329
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:13,849
She'll be looking after you,

330
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:16,018
along with all the other girls
in your ward.

331
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,062
I'm here every day except Friday.

332
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:21,232
Follow the rules,
and we will get along just great.

333
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:23,234
Do you have any questions for us?

334
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:27,279
C- could I have some paper
and some colored pencils

335
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,030
to draw with?

336
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,992
Unfortunately, pens and pencils
are not allowed in our facility.

337
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:34,286
But maybe we can get you
some Crayolas.

338
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:35,704
Would that do?

339
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:37,415
Yes, Ma'am.

340
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,208
Do you have anything to add?

341
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:40,418
Just the pills.

342
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:42,670
Here you go.

343
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:45,548
Take these.

344
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:47,633
But I'm not sick.

345
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,510
Don't worry.
Everybody here takes 'em.

346
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,263
Come on.

347
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:03,566
Good girl.

348
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:27,006
After a few days,

349
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:31,844
I learned that this was no place
to get back your wits,

350
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:35,598
even if you never lost them
in the first place.

351
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:50,070
Your Honor...

352
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:51,113
About two months later,

353
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:54,241
I was called upon to prove
to the judge I was 16...

354
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:55,826
However, we do reserve the right...

355
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:58,245
...which made Phil
a statutory rapist.

356
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:00,080
Thank you.

357
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:04,585
Very well.
The witness is excused.

358
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:12,593
At first...

359
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:16,931
...I didn't know
what was different about him

360
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:20,935
until I realized
that his hair was gray.

361
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,271
Phil.

362
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:28,067
He must have been dying it
all this time.

363
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:52,007
Hey, Red.

364
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:54,635
Here.

365
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:01,600
I can't imagine you mixed up
with that creep.

366
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:04,937
He ought to be taken out
and hung up by his balls.

367
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:07,064
Fuckin' child molester.

368
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:09,400
No, it was my fault.

369
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:14,029
Now, that's a load of crap.

370
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:16,699
You know, in my opinion,
all men are pigs.

371
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,497
Hey.

372
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:25,499
Practice with these.

373
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:26,584
Come on, take 'em.

374
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,673
Now, just don't tell the doc, okay?

375
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:37,803
Now, Red,

376
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:40,889
don't let anything they said
about you back there bother you.

377
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,808
Okay?

378
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:46,687
You're just a pretty girI
that got taken advantage of.

379
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:48,647
I don't belong here, Cindy.

380
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:50,733
Oh, I know you don't,

381
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:52,901
but it's just how the system works.

382
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,739
It's killing me.

383
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:01,660
Well, you just do your time,
and before you know it,

384
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:03,495
you'll be starting all over again.

385
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:04,997
Come on. Let's get you to bed.

386
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:29,021
Kill the lights in five minutes.

387
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:36,654
I heard that Phil
got sentenced

388
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:40,532
to 18 months in state prison.

389
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:46,664
I really couldn't care less,
being in one of my own.

390
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:04,890
Fuck! Aah!

391
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:22,449
Hey!

392
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:24,827
We got a bleeder!

393
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:27,496
No! Let me die!

394
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:32,876
Let me die!

395
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:35,170
We got a bleeder here!
We got a bleeder!

396
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:39,091
Let me die!

397
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:41,844
Let me die!
Let me die! Damn it!

398
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:09,788
Hey. Pill time!

399
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:20,132
I'm gonna take a break.
You want to go for a smoke?

400
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:21,800
Won't I get in trouble?

401
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:24,011
Hey, you're with me.

402
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:25,721
Oh, of course.

403
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:30,434
Hey, Red.

404
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:32,394
Geez, this is good!

405
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:36,482
I wish I had me some watercolors.

406
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:39,193
Let's go.

407
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:41,403
Just a sec.

408
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:51,205
Isn't it amazing
how you can still find beauty

409
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:52,456
no matter where you are?

410
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:54,792
Mm.

411
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,085
I don't know if I ever told you,

412
00:29:57,212 --> 00:30:00,839
but I'm pretty good
with hair and make-up.

413
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:03,425
I've even been called
an artist before.

414
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,220
I mean, not in the same way
as you, but...

415
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:09,807
I bet I could make you
look reaI pretty.

416
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:12,309
I mean, prettier
than you already are.

417
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:16,522
Now, what I would never do
is cover up those freckles.

418
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:20,359
They give your skin
little dots of sunlight.

419
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:23,487
You know, some people call them
little kisses from God.

420
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:28,283
But, you know, if you keep pulling
your hair back in a ponytaiI,

421
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:29,368
it's gonna recede.

422
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,203
You might go bald.

423
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:35,624
But what I would do
is cut it a little shorter

424
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:38,293
so it'll frame your face just right,

425
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:41,004
and you'll be just as pretty
as one of your pictures.

426
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:14,329
Sorry.

427
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:35,976
It wasn't too bad
being loved by a woman.

428
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:36,935
Once you get going,

429
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:41,064
it doesn't matter who it is
and what they've got.

430
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:45,319
All you have to do
is close your eyes.

431
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:58,457
I think you might need these.

432
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:03,503
Thank you, Ms. Ames.

433
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:06,924
You have Cindy to thank.
She told me about your drawings.

434
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:09,551
It's good therapy.
Keep it up.

435
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:13,347
Nice to have an artist in residence.

436
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:22,105
I'll pay you a dollar
if you paint my picture.

437
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:27,986
If they didn't have a mirror,
they had me.

438
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:30,739
Some of the likenesses
weren't very good,

439
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:34,493
but since in most cases
they were better than the originals,

440
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:37,579
nobody much minded.

441
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:44,920
Shh!

442
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:48,048
Shh!

443
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:51,093
Aah.

444
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:52,844
Shh!

445
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:59,935
I'm gonna lose my job
if you keep this up.

446
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:00,852
Shh!

447
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:01,687
Ohh.

448
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:02,896
Mm.

449
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:07,776
Oh, I want it to be like this
all the time, don't you?

450
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:09,695
Mm.

451
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:13,323
You're damn straight I do.

452
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:17,452
Then get me out of here, Cindy.

453
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:26,503
You know, I've been thinkin'...

454
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:29,881
I might have a plan.

455
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:34,094
But you just have to
promise me something.

456
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:37,848
You gotta live with me
and stay with me forever...

457
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:40,308
don't ever leave... never ever.

458
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:41,184
I mean it.

459
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,731
I'll never leave you, Cindy.

460
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:47,816
You promise?

461
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:51,069
I swear.

462
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,113
Oh, shit.

463
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,147
Good night, Dan.

464
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:11,441
Good night, Cindy.

465
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:23,662
Goddamn it, Red.

466
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:26,206
You look beautiful.

467
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:30,210
Wow!

468
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:31,920
I look like somebody else.

469
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:34,214
You are somebody else, baby.

470
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,550
You're my woman now.
Don't you ever forget it.

471
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:44,307
Oh, shit, I gotta go!

472
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:47,060
Oh, they're gonna know
you're missing by now.

473
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:49,020
They're gonna be asking
so many questions.

474
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,314
Well, what time do you think
you'll be back?

475
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:53,692
Soon, honey, soon.

476
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:55,068
I got the next two days off.

477
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:57,154
We'll spend it in bed!

478
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:59,197
Can we go to the beach? Please?

479
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:00,949
No!

480
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:03,034
We gotta lay low
till this whole thing blows over.

481
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,077
Jesus Christ.

482
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,165
I don't want you
looking out that window.

483
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:09,291
You got me?

484
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:12,294
Okay.

485
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,087
I'll just watch TV or something.

486
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:15,589
That's a good idea.
Listen, honey.

487
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,841
In another year you're gonna be 18.

488
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,177
They won't be able to touch us then.

489
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:22,137
Just don't worry
about anything, okay?

490
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:24,055
I'm gonna take care of you
from here on out.

491
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:25,849
You always have.

492
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:28,435
I love you.

493
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:31,521
Mm. Oh.

494
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:39,613
Lock the door.

495
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:03,762
I didn't mean to,
but I'm sure I hurt Cindy reaI bad.

496
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:12,229
I had saved almost $100
from my watercolors,

497
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:15,023
just enough money
to get me out of the town,

498
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:16,942
out of the county,

499
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:22,113
and out of the state
of South Carolina forever!

500
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:27,244
For the first time in my life,
I was really free.

501
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:31,790
# Jolene, Jolene #

502
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,544
I had all kinds of jobs.

503
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:40,382
There was always a YWCA,
where I could stay out of trouble,

504
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:42,884
and out of sight.

505
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:45,929
Hop in, darlin'.
Get your pretty little butt up here.

506
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:49,057
But I did have to take
a deep breath on occasion

507
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:51,893
and sell it once or twice
across the country.

508
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:54,604
# When you dance on that... #

509
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:56,898
I was just 17,

510
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:59,734
but I carried myself
like I was 10 years older.

511
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:03,613
# I wonder, do you know #

512
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:10,870
# How many hearts
you're gonna break #

513
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:12,622
Yeah!

514
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:14,124
Ahh!

515
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:20,088
# Jolene, Jolene #

516
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:28,471
# Yeah, you strut
just like a queen #

517
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:36,646
# You make all the boys
jump and shout #

518
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:49,492
# Jolene, Jolene, yeah, yeah #

519
00:38:57,585 --> 00:39:00,295
# If you want to be happy
for the rest of your life #

520
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:03,048
# Never make a pretty woman
your wife #

521
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,925
# So from my personaI
point of view... #

522
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:08,636
All right. Y'all got
two queenie burgers,

523
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:09,971
fries, and a royal shake.

524
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:10,847
$8.17, please.

525
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:11,890
Keep the change.

526
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,433
Hey, thanks!

527
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:15,977
# So from my personaI
point of view #

528
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:18,396
# Get an ugly girI to marry you #

529
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:20,982
# A pretty woman makes
her husband look small #

530
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:23,610
# And very often
causes his downfall #

531
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:26,529
# As soon as he marries her,
then she starts #

532
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:29,157
# To do the things
that will break his heart #

533
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:32,077
Hey, how come it's only
the guys that tip?

534
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,995
'Cause the girls are jealous of you,
that's why.

535
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:36,414
# An ugly woman
cooks her meals on time #

536
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,875
# She'll always give you
peace of mind #

537
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:41,586
# If you want to be happy
for the rest of your life #

538
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,963
# Never make a pretty woman
your wife #

539
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,674
# So from my personaI
point of view #

540
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:48,510
# Get an ugly girI to marry you #

541
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:51,137
Oh, that freak is here again.

542
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:53,973
I can't stand him.
He gives me the creeps.

543
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:57,936
Oh, come on, Kendra.
He's funny.

544
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,020
Funny?

545
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:00,814
Funny-looking maybe.

546
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,774
No, I think he's kind of cute.

547
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,860
Ew. Did you ever take a good whiff?

548
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:08,196
I don't smell the customers, Kendra.

549
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:10,615
Well, he reeks.

550
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:13,201
Seems like he eats here every day.

551
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:16,079
Duh. He's not here
for the food, Jolene.

552
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:17,747
He's got a crush on you.

553
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:19,165
He does not.

554
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:20,708
It's so obvious.

555
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,919
Why do you think
he's always asking for you?

556
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:27,132
I don't know.
Because I'm a kick-ass waitress?

557
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,092
Don't worry.

558
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:30,510
I'Il take his order.

559
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,437
What can I get you?

560
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:45,275
You can get me Jolene.

561
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:46,609
I want her to wait on me.

562
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:48,570
She's busy with other customers.

563
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:52,699
Doesn't look too busy to me.

564
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:54,492
I can wait.

565
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:56,035
# Never make a pretty woman
your wife #

566
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,413
# So from my personaI
point of view #

567
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:01,124
# Get an ugly girI to marry you #

568
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:03,668
Just tell her I wrote her a song.

569
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:06,087
# Never make a pretty woman
your wife #

570
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:08,715
# So from my personaI
point of view #

571
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:10,967
# Get an ugly girI to marry you #

572
00:41:11,093 --> 00:41:14,387
# If you want to be happy
for the rest of your life #

573
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:17,390
He wants you to take his order.

574
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:19,684
He said he wrote a song for you
or something like that.

575
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:22,020
I can barely understand
a word he says.

576
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,688
He wrote a song for me?

577
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:27,066
He's a loser. I bet he deals.

578
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:29,903
Oh, I don't think he's that bad.

579
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:32,739
Fine. You take care of him, then.

580
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:34,741
I was only trying to help you out.

581
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:39,287
I can take care of myself.

582
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:43,791
Nice to see you again.

583
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:45,543
You sure must like this place.

584
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:49,672
Where else in Phoenix
can I get service like this...

585
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:51,841
from someone so charmin'?

586
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:56,513
I'd like to formally introduce myself.

587
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:58,056
I'm Coco Leger.

588
00:41:58,807 --> 00:41:59,807
Originally from New Orleans.

589
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:02,727
I'm Jolene.

590
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:06,064
It says so right there
on your name tag. You mind?

591
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:09,651
"Jolene. "

592
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:19,619
# When I wake up in the mornin' #

593
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:23,414
# And I drive out to see Jolene #

594
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:26,918
# But my tongue gets tied
around a chili dog #

595
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:29,379
# She's my desert queen #

596
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:33,174
# She skates over to my window #

597
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:36,511
# A sweeter rack I've never seen #

598
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:39,556
# So you better not complain, girI #

599
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:43,351
# That I love you, Jole-e-e-ene! #

600
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:54,779
Thank you.

601
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:55,989
I got to get back to work now.

602
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:00,326
You want to take a ride
in my Deuce Corona later?

603
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:02,120
Maybe some other time.

604
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:04,664
You wanna go dancin' with me
on Saturday night?

605
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:08,585
# Whoo! #

606
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:10,628
# Super highways #

607
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:12,797
# Coast to coast #

608
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:16,384
# Easy to get anywhere #

609
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:19,053
# On the transcontinental #

610
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:20,847
# Overload #

611
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:23,182
# Just slide behind the wheel #

612
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:25,018
# How does it feel? #

613
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:27,145
# When there's no destination #

614
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:28,605
# That's too far #

615
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:33,276
# And somewhere on the way,
you might find out who you are #

616
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:34,068
# Whoo! #

617
00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:36,821
# Living in America #

618
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:38,072
# Oh! #

619
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:40,074
# Eye to eye #

620
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,285
# Station to station #

621
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:44,037
# Living in America #

622
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:45,997
He was no rock star,

623
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:48,124
but he was a gentleman
and a good dancer,

624
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:51,961
and he didn't mind
making a fooI of himself.

625
00:43:52,087 --> 00:43:53,671
I kind of liked that.

626
00:43:56,258 --> 00:43:57,634
# I feeI good! #

627
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:14,275
But mostly...

628
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:16,402
...he made me laugh.

629
00:44:18,405 --> 00:44:22,825
And I hadn't had a reason to laugh
in a long time.

630
00:44:27,956 --> 00:44:30,124
Well, this is it.

631
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:32,710
This is who I am.

632
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:36,673
You own this place?

633
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:38,841
Whose name do you see up there
in the lights?

634
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:42,345
Wow!

635
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:44,639
Started it up with a grand
and a prayer.

636
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:47,308
That is so cool.

637
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:14,544
Are these your designs?

638
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,713
Art don't belong to anybody.

639
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:19,757
We are merely the fortunate vessels
that channel it.

640
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:21,884
You know...

641
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:23,803
...I draw.

642
00:45:24,763 --> 00:45:25,471
Oh, yeah?

643
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:29,016
I've been told I'm pretty good.

644
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:31,185
Oh, I bet you have, darlin'.

645
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:35,440
Here, take a bang.

646
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:36,566
No.

647
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:41,779
See? It's a little like
paintin' with a needle.

648
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:43,948
Intense...

649
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:45,950
and complicated.

650
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:49,579
And that's why I call it an institute.

651
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:53,332
Come on, give it a try.
It ain't gonna hurt ya.

652
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:55,585
Let's get institutionalized.

653
00:46:02,217 --> 00:46:05,219
I just love art.

654
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:07,930
Any kind.

655
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:13,144
I especially like
doing portraits, but...

656
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:15,271
Oh.

657
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:17,273
Say "ah. "

658
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:21,861
Ahhhh.

659
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:37,293
Be my apprentice.

660
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:40,671
Are you serious?

661
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:42,089
Yeah, I'm serious.

662
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:44,425
I just fired the chick
who worked for me.

663
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:46,260
She had a face
like a smacked ass.

664
00:46:48,847 --> 00:46:51,015
You can start with stock tattoos.

665
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:55,144
Time will tell whether you truly are
also a fortunate vesseI.

666
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:57,939
I'm a fast learner.

667
00:46:58,148 --> 00:47:00,608
That's what I'm sayin', babe.

668
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:05,863
Now, sit tight, and let me show you
what Coco can do when he channels.

669
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:12,078
Ugh. That is just so gross.

670
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:14,163
I can't believe you let him
touch you there.

671
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:15,623
I think it's sexy.

672
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:18,751
I guess that makes it official.

673
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:21,128
You're just mad
'cause I'm moving out.

674
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:23,923
I don't mind you moving out.

675
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:26,884
I just wish you would've picked
somebody else to move in with.

676
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:29,220
You've only known him
a couple weeks.

677
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:31,556
He gave me a job.

678
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:33,975
I have an artistic job.

679
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:37,937
You think that little heart
on your ass is artistic?

680
00:47:39,314 --> 00:47:41,941
I knew you wouldn't understand.

681
00:47:42,067 --> 00:47:43,317
He believes in me.

682
00:47:43,443 --> 00:47:44,652
It's an act.

683
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:46,946
You're gonna get hurt, Jolene.

684
00:47:49,741 --> 00:47:51,367
I see what he sees in you.

685
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:53,202
Thank you.

686
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:57,123
But I cannot see
what you see in him.

687
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:29,947
Coco was right on.

688
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:31,073
Nice.

689
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:31,991
Trust, Sid.

690
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:34,201
All you got to do is have the trust.

691
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:35,703
I told you she had talent.

692
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:38,748
Yeah, if she didn't,
I'd kick your ass around the block.

693
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:47,423
Hey, uh, you hang on to that woman.

694
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:50,092
All right, man?
She's ripe.

695
00:48:50,218 --> 00:48:51,969
Fuck off.

696
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:05,524
You did it, baby.
You made Coco proud.

697
00:50:02,874 --> 00:50:04,125
Let's just do it.

698
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:14,927
Was I wrong here?

699
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:21,475
No.

700
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:25,855
It's just that I was
already married once,

701
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:27,523
and it didn't work out so good.

702
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:33,988
I mean, it's sweet, Coco.

703
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:36,991
It's real, real sweet.

704
00:50:41,997 --> 00:50:44,290
But I don't think so.

705
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:46,333
But you're the one, babe.

706
00:50:47,794 --> 00:50:49,420
Babe, I've heard that before.

707
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:50,963
Not from me.

708
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:56,260
No, I'm an orphan in the storm
just like you are.

709
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:59,305
Now, they didn't much like me
where I came from.

710
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:02,933
Hell, as I understand it,

711
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:04,977
neither of us has a past
to write home about.

712
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:09,690
I think we both know...

713
00:51:09,816 --> 00:51:12,193
there's more to life than...

714
00:51:13,528 --> 00:51:14,862
...that.

715
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:18,783
What counts is this very moment...

716
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:21,869
and the future moments.

717
00:51:21,995 --> 00:51:24,789
And all the other moments
is just bullshit.

718
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:26,123
See what I'm saying?

719
00:51:29,252 --> 00:51:32,254
We artists gotta stick together
if we're gonna survive.

720
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:38,052
I love you, Jolene.

721
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:41,097
Please say yes.

722
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:48,604
I knew nothing
about him...

723
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:52,316
his past, his family.

724
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:55,528
I knew nothing.

725
00:51:55,654 --> 00:52:00,074
But when I said the name
"Jolene Leger"

726
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,118
secretly to myself...

727
00:52:02,911 --> 00:52:04,078
I do.

728
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:08,249
...I thought it had a nice ring to it.

729
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:11,085
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

730
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:13,295
# If I give my heart to you #

731
00:52:13,421 --> 00:52:15,756
Whoo! Yeah!

732
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:18,384
# Are you gonna break it? #

733
00:52:20,428 --> 00:52:24,723
# If I give my hand to you #

734
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:27,101
# Are you gonna take it? #

735
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:50,791
# Jolene, my desert queen #

736
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:56,213
# Gonna take you to heaven
on the love machine #

737
00:52:56,339 --> 00:53:00,467
# Gonna fill your vesseI
with my Coco cream #

738
00:53:01,928 --> 00:53:05,097
# You're the finest piece of ass #

739
00:53:05,223 --> 00:53:07,183
# That I've ever seen #

740
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:30,206
If you shaved his beard,
scrubbed off the tattoos,

741
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:34,168
got rid of his boots
with the lifts in them,

742
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:38,297
and gave him a haircut
and a pair of glasses...

743
00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:42,843
...he would've looked
a lot like Mickey.

744
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:10,537
That looks mighty fine.

745
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:14,375
And so does the tattoo.

746
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:15,501
It better.

747
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:18,337
Where are you off to?

748
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:19,838
Just business.

749
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:21,590
When you coming back?

750
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:33,435
Where's he going in such a hurry?

751
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:34,395
I don't know.

752
00:54:35,897 --> 00:54:38,691
He's away in his stupid car
half the time.

753
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:03,924
What do you think he's doing
in there all this time?

754
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:07,386
Duh, he's dealing drugs
just like I told you he was.

755
00:55:07,512 --> 00:55:10,180
No, he wouldn't do that to me.

756
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:11,140
Get real, Jolene.

757
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:13,225
What else do you think
is going on in there?

758
00:55:20,608 --> 00:55:22,109
I'm gonna find out.

759
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:27,072
Are you insane?!
Get back in here!

760
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:40,502
Whoa, whoa! What the hell
are you doin' here?!

761
00:55:40,628 --> 00:55:42,838
Are you out of your fuckin' mind?
You're gonna get yourself killed!

762
00:55:42,964 --> 00:55:44,173
Are you dealing, Coco?

763
00:55:44,382 --> 00:55:46,800
Just calm down, all right?
Just keep it down.

764
00:55:46,926 --> 00:55:49,386
Answer me. I want to know now.
Are you dealing?

765
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:54,433
Babe...

766
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:57,436
it's the only way
to keep the shop going.

767
00:55:59,105 --> 00:56:01,315
Dealing, Coco?! Why the hell
do you have to do that?!

768
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:03,734
You don't question me!

769
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:06,737
Do you hear me?

770
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:09,990
I'm doin' the best I can
for the both of us.

771
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:13,410
Come here.

772
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:14,912
- No.
- Come here.

773
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:29,927
No artist in the USA can make it

774
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:34,098
if he didn't lubricate his vesseI
with a little somethin' on the side.

775
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:36,850
You're so full of shit.

776
00:56:37,602 --> 00:56:38,685
Oh, come on, baby.

777
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:40,771
Coco would never do anything
to hurt you.

778
00:56:41,147 --> 00:56:42,564
"Oh, baby," nothing.

779
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:47,361
You better not hurt me, Coco.

780
00:56:49,614 --> 00:56:51,490
Or I might hurt you back.

781
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:34,324
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Coco Leger.

782
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:35,033
Is he here?

783
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:35,742
No.

784
00:57:36,661 --> 00:57:38,579
Well, do you know
when he'll be back?

785
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:41,457
Who wants to know?

786
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:47,212
Mrs. Coco Leger, the wife.

787
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:51,425
You... you mean ex-wife, right?

788
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:56,930
He didn't tell you, did he?

789
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:01,226
Whoa!

790
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:05,147
Listen, you little slut!

791
00:58:05,273 --> 00:58:07,983
I have spent
every fucking cent I have

792
00:58:08,109 --> 00:58:10,027
tracking down that bastard!

793
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:12,154
Do not waste my time.

794
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:13,530
Fucking find him!

795
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:16,617
I told you, he's not here.

796
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:19,411
Will you look at this!

797
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:22,831
Here. Fucking hold him, please.

798
00:58:23,708 --> 00:58:25,959
That son of a bitch.

799
00:58:26,544 --> 00:58:28,337
Uh...

800
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:30,214
Damn, girI.
Where have you...

801
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:31,757
Bastard!

802
00:58:31,883 --> 00:58:32,466
...been?

803
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:33,258
Asshole!

804
00:58:33,384 --> 00:58:34,718
Now, Marin, just be cool.

805
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:36,470
There's an explanation
for everything.

806
00:58:40,391 --> 00:58:42,142
You got one for me?

807
00:58:42,268 --> 00:58:45,187
Let's see you sweet-talk your way
out of this one, asshole.

808
00:58:45,396 --> 00:58:47,523
Now, Marin, believe it or not,

809
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:50,817
I am greatly relieved
to see you and, um...

810
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:52,819
- Coco Jr.
- Mm.

811
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:55,822
So if you just like to come this way,
we can take a ride.

812
00:58:56,324 --> 00:58:57,491
Are you kidding me?

813
00:58:57,951 --> 00:59:00,202
Just sit tight, Jolene.
I'll be back soon. Hmm?

814
00:59:00,328 --> 00:59:02,454
Step to the right, honey.

815
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:22,641
Ugh!

816
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:34,945
You know, I draw!

817
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:57,736
911. Please state your emergency.

818
01:00:57,862 --> 01:00:59,655
Hello? This is 911.

819
01:01:00,448 --> 01:01:04,159
The weirdest feeling
came over me.

820
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:07,037
I felt like a child again,

821
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:11,917
like I was only a pretend adult

822
01:01:12,043 --> 01:01:16,046
and that I was never
Mrs. Coco Leger.

823
01:01:16,172 --> 01:01:19,716
For the first time in a long time,

824
01:01:19,842 --> 01:01:23,845
I wondered who my reaI parents
might have been,

825
01:01:23,971 --> 01:01:27,307
if they were still alive,

826
01:01:27,433 --> 01:01:31,687
and why they bothered
to name me Jolene...

827
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:36,983
only to leave me
to the authorities to raise.

828
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:31,121
# Since you've gone #

829
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:37,919
# I spend each lonely night #

830
01:02:38,045 --> 01:02:46,219
# Dealing out the cards
from left to right #

831
01:02:46,345 --> 01:02:53,435
# And the king of hearts
is there to remind me #

832
01:02:54,353 --> 01:03:03,320
# That I'm all alone,
playing solitaire #

833
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:11,244
# Love was just another game
for two #

834
01:03:11,370 --> 01:03:18,043
# I see now that's all
it meant to you #

835
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:26,676
# And my heart got lost
somewhere in the shuffle #

836
01:03:27,386 --> 01:03:34,184
# So I'm all alone
playing solitaire #

837
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:44,361
# In each romance #

838
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:48,406
# There's an element of chance #

839
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:54,412
# A gamble to win or to lose #

840
01:03:55,456 --> 01:03:59,584
# You play to win #

841
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:05,465
# Then you find
you're playing in a game #

842
01:04:05,591 --> 01:04:08,718
# With no rules #

843
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:12,597
# Just made for fools #

844
01:04:12,723 --> 01:04:19,563
# Now the joker
has a laugh on me #

845
01:04:20,064 --> 01:04:28,238
# 'Cause I've played my hand
so carelessly #

846
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:35,203
# And untiI you want to share
that old feeling #

847
01:04:36,205 --> 01:04:41,918
# I'll be dealing time away #

848
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:45,338
# Dealing time away #

849
01:04:45,464 --> 01:04:53,638
# With solitaire #

850
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:31,718
SaI, this is Baby.
She's one of our finest dancers.

851
01:05:32,386 --> 01:05:33,929
It's a pleasure to meet you.

852
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:36,097
Hello.

853
01:05:37,058 --> 01:05:39,643
Can I buy you
a glass of champagne?

854
01:05:40,728 --> 01:05:42,479
I'd rather give you a dance.

855
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:44,481
That's not necessary.

856
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:45,941
I just want to talk.

857
01:05:46,067 --> 01:05:47,651
Why don't you ask your boss
if you can sit here

858
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:49,027
and join me for a little while?

859
01:05:49,570 --> 01:05:50,904
Anything for you, Sal.

860
01:05:51,238 --> 01:05:52,989
Thanks. Sit.

861
01:06:00,414 --> 01:06:04,042
I'm Sal Fontaine, and you're... Baby.

862
01:06:06,003 --> 01:06:07,796
Actually, I'm Jolene.

863
01:06:08,005 --> 01:06:09,547
Jolene?

864
01:06:09,674 --> 01:06:12,384
Well, Jolene, I was really taken
by your performance out there.

865
01:06:12,510 --> 01:06:13,969
You're a very gifted dancer.

866
01:06:14,095 --> 01:06:15,512
Did you study somewhere?

867
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:20,308
No. I just like music.

868
01:06:20,518 --> 01:06:23,311
Well, it certainly shows.

869
01:06:23,437 --> 01:06:24,938
You're stunning.

870
01:06:25,731 --> 01:06:27,649
Thank you.

871
01:06:27,858 --> 01:06:28,650
You're welcome.

872
01:06:28,776 --> 01:06:30,527
I'm trying to decide
if I like "Jolene" better

873
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:32,028
or "Baby" better... I don't know.

874
01:06:47,378 --> 01:06:50,005
SaI was a gentleman.

875
01:06:50,131 --> 01:06:53,591
He never sat at the stage
to stare at my ass like the others.

876
01:06:53,718 --> 01:06:55,760
He was highly respected
in the community

877
01:06:55,886 --> 01:06:57,679
as the owner of Sal's Line.

878
01:06:57,805 --> 01:07:00,390
He gave people advice
on everything...

879
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:02,350
like about horses

880
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:04,936
or like who would be
the next president,

881
01:07:05,062 --> 01:07:06,896
and he was usually right.

882
01:07:07,106 --> 01:07:12,360
That was the kind of solid citizen
Mr. Sal Fontaine was.

883
01:07:16,282 --> 01:07:18,033
You live in a museum, Sal.

884
01:07:20,286 --> 01:07:22,746
This place is incredible.

885
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:24,914
You know, they have a wonderful
museum right here in town.

886
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:26,374
I can take you there if you like.

887
01:07:28,002 --> 01:07:29,044
That'd be nice.

888
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:30,879
All right.

889
01:07:35,468 --> 01:07:37,677
Where'd you get
all these beautiful things?

890
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:40,722
I have a habit of collecting things.
I can't help it.

891
01:07:40,848 --> 01:07:42,348
When I see something I like,
I buy it.

892
01:07:45,936 --> 01:07:47,562
So, you like art?

893
01:07:47,688 --> 01:07:49,022
Mm, I love it.

894
01:07:49,148 --> 01:07:50,106
I can see.

895
01:07:53,235 --> 01:07:56,613
Oh, my God, it's like Christmas!

896
01:07:56,739 --> 01:07:59,157
It is Christmas, princess.
Come on, let me show you.

897
01:07:59,283 --> 01:08:01,409
Come on.

898
01:08:10,044 --> 01:08:13,922
You must be reaI happy
living up here in your sky palace.

899
01:08:14,048 --> 01:08:17,008
Under the right circumstances,
you can be happy living anywhere.

900
01:08:17,134 --> 01:08:18,551
Come on, I want
to show you something.

901
01:08:18,677 --> 01:08:19,302
Come on.

902
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:24,933
Give me your coat.

903
01:08:32,191 --> 01:08:34,109
Beautiful, isn't she?

904
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:40,031
It's my greatest possession.

905
01:08:40,157 --> 01:08:41,116
Hmm.

906
01:08:45,162 --> 01:08:47,914
Reminds me of you.

907
01:08:57,424 --> 01:08:59,551
You did all this for me, didn't you?

908
01:08:59,718 --> 01:09:01,845
All for you, princess.

909
01:09:08,352 --> 01:09:09,936
Who are all these people, Sal?

910
01:09:10,062 --> 01:09:13,273
Oh, relatives, kids.

911
01:09:13,482 --> 01:09:14,816
Do they live here?

912
01:09:14,942 --> 01:09:16,359
No, they all moved away.

913
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:17,694
Do you ever get to see them?

914
01:09:17,903 --> 01:09:19,028
Not too often.

915
01:09:24,702 --> 01:09:26,077
That was my wife.

916
01:09:26,287 --> 01:09:27,620
She's beautiful.

917
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:29,914
Thank you. She was.

918
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:31,958
She died a long time ago.

919
01:09:32,084 --> 01:09:33,543
The pictures are old, like me.

920
01:09:35,212 --> 01:09:37,005
You're not so old.

921
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:42,343
I'm not so young, either.

922
01:09:42,469 --> 01:09:44,721
I don't think age
makes any difference.

923
01:09:44,847 --> 01:09:46,764
You know what?
I don't think so, either.

924
01:09:47,057 --> 01:09:48,850
Life is about moments.

925
01:09:48,976 --> 01:09:52,187
When you find a good one,
you don't let it go.

926
01:09:54,982 --> 01:09:56,608
Let me ask you a question, Jolene.

927
01:09:56,734 --> 01:09:58,860
What are the odds of you
moving in here with me?

928
01:10:02,072 --> 01:10:05,033
I'd say that'd be
a pretty risky bet, Sal.

929
01:10:05,993 --> 01:10:07,285
Really?

930
01:10:07,536 --> 01:10:09,704
Mm-hmm.

931
01:10:11,123 --> 01:10:13,333
Jolene, stop dancing
and move in with me.

932
01:10:16,879 --> 01:10:17,962
Are you serious?

933
01:10:18,088 --> 01:10:21,257
I told you once...
I never say anything I don't mean.

934
01:10:21,383 --> 01:10:23,301
And I never go back on my word.

935
01:10:28,057 --> 01:10:29,974
This is for you.

936
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:32,936
There's no limit on it.

937
01:10:33,062 --> 01:10:34,896
You could have
your own beauty parlor,

938
01:10:35,022 --> 01:10:39,234
Olympic-sized swimming pool, spa,
maid service every morning.

939
01:10:39,443 --> 01:10:41,069
You could order food 24 hours a day,

940
01:10:41,195 --> 01:10:42,779
whenever you want,
whatever you want.

941
01:10:45,324 --> 01:10:47,659
All you have to do is say yes.

942
01:10:48,702 --> 01:10:51,412
Why me? You could have
anybody you want.

943
01:10:52,873 --> 01:10:55,083
I don't want anybody else.

944
01:10:55,209 --> 01:10:57,001
I want you.

945
01:10:57,670 --> 01:11:00,296
You don't want me. Trust me.

946
01:11:00,506 --> 01:11:03,132
Don't sell yourself short, Jolene.

947
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:04,425
You deserve the best there is,

948
01:11:04,635 --> 01:11:06,928
even if you don't know it yet.

949
01:11:07,763 --> 01:11:09,347
Let me take care of you,

950
01:11:09,765 --> 01:11:13,726
and in return, I'll have
the pleasure of your company.

951
01:11:13,852 --> 01:11:17,021
And you can walk out that door
any time you want...

952
01:11:17,147 --> 01:11:18,606
no strings.

953
01:11:23,779 --> 01:11:26,531
What do you say? Huh?

954
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:35,081
Hmm?

955
01:11:37,251 --> 01:11:38,418
Merry Christmas.

956
01:11:38,544 --> 01:11:42,547
He believed, or pretended
to believe, my life story.

957
01:11:42,673 --> 01:11:43,715
Merry Christmas.

958
01:11:43,841 --> 01:11:47,802
The parts that were made up,
as well as the parts that were true.

959
01:11:51,098 --> 01:11:54,642
# Heavenly shades of night
are falling #

960
01:11:54,768 --> 01:11:56,894
# It's twilight time #

961
01:11:57,104 --> 01:12:00,857
# Out of the mist,
your voice is calling #

962
01:12:00,983 --> 01:12:03,568
# 'tis twilight time #

963
01:12:04,028 --> 01:12:09,365
# When purple-colored curtains
mark the end of day #

964
01:12:09,491 --> 01:12:14,203
# I'll hear you, my dear,
at twilight time #

965
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:16,039
It's so beautiful here.

966
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:18,624
You should have seen it
30 years ago, princess.

967
01:12:18,751 --> 01:12:20,126
The Sands, The Flamingo.

968
01:12:20,252 --> 01:12:21,586
They were hotels.

969
01:12:21,712 --> 01:12:23,504
That was Vegas.

970
01:12:23,630 --> 01:12:24,756
Not like it is now.

971
01:12:24,882 --> 01:12:27,133
All these hotels...
they're amusement parks.

972
01:12:27,259 --> 01:12:28,760
Back then, everybody
was dressed up...

973
01:12:28,886 --> 01:12:32,513
tuxedos... we'd drink martinis,
share our olives together.

974
01:12:32,639 --> 01:12:33,973
What do you mean?

975
01:12:34,099 --> 01:12:35,099
We would drink our martinis,

976
01:12:35,225 --> 01:12:36,851
and at the end,
we would share our olives.

977
01:12:36,977 --> 01:12:40,271
It was a sign of friendship, respect.

978
01:12:41,482 --> 01:12:47,445
# Here in the afterglow of day #

979
01:12:47,571 --> 01:12:52,909
# We keep our rendezvous
beneath the blue #

980
01:12:53,827 --> 01:12:59,540
# Here in the sweet
and same old way #

981
01:12:59,666 --> 01:13:06,172
# I fall in love again
as I did then #

982
01:13:06,298 --> 01:13:09,592
# Deep in the dark,
your kiss will thrill me #

983
01:13:09,718 --> 01:13:12,261
# Like days of old #

984
01:13:12,388 --> 01:13:14,514
# Lighting the spark of love... #

985
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:17,517
I would tell him I loved him,

986
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:22,271
and at the moment I said it, I did.

987
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:24,649
# Just to be with you #

988
01:13:24,775 --> 01:13:31,239
# Together, at last at twilight time #

989
01:13:31,365 --> 01:13:37,120
# Here in the afterglow of day #

990
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:40,123
# We keep our rendezvous... #

991
01:13:40,249 --> 01:13:42,166
What's the matter, princess?

992
01:13:42,292 --> 01:13:43,709
Well, I'm just a little nervous

993
01:13:43,836 --> 01:13:45,711
about meeting your friends,
that's all.

994
01:13:45,838 --> 01:13:48,256
Are you kidding? Come on.
They're gonna love you.

995
01:13:48,382 --> 01:13:50,383
Let me tell you something.
Everybody loves you.

996
01:13:52,261 --> 01:13:56,305
# As I did then #

997
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:57,432
Hey. Frank.

998
01:13:57,558 --> 01:13:59,100
- Sal, good to see you.
- Jimmy.

999
01:13:59,226 --> 01:14:00,726
How you doing?
- This is Jolene.

1000
01:14:00,853 --> 01:14:02,520
- Hey, Jolene.
- Nice to meet you.

1001
01:14:03,313 --> 01:14:05,064
I guess we're not talking
business tonight.

1002
01:14:05,566 --> 01:14:07,567
Come on. You know the routine.
All right?

1003
01:14:07,776 --> 01:14:09,569
Hey, Sal, I was just hoping we could
talk about the new accounts.

1004
01:14:09,695 --> 01:14:11,821
Can we have a nice night? Huh?
Let's have a nice night.

1005
01:14:13,198 --> 01:14:14,365
Sal, with all due respect...

1006
01:14:14,491 --> 01:14:15,450
Are you deaf?

1007
01:14:15,576 --> 01:14:18,327
Hey, SaI,
Frank has a few propositions

1008
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:19,787
he wants to run by you.

1009
01:14:19,913 --> 01:14:22,373
I'm running things
for 25 years one way,

1010
01:14:22,499 --> 01:14:23,541
and that's the way it stays.

1011
01:14:23,667 --> 01:14:25,501
Hey, all he's asking you
is to keep an open mind.

1012
01:14:25,627 --> 01:14:26,544
We don't have to talk about it now.

1013
01:14:26,670 --> 01:14:28,713
No, we don't have to talk
about it now...

1014
01:14:28,839 --> 01:14:29,672
or ever.

1015
01:14:32,759 --> 01:14:34,969
Okay. Whatever you say, Sal.

1016
01:14:35,095 --> 01:14:36,762
That's right. Whatever I say.

1017
01:14:41,643 --> 01:14:42,935
You having a good time, honey?

1018
01:14:43,312 --> 01:14:44,479
Mm-hmm.

1019
01:14:50,903 --> 01:14:53,446
Hey.

1020
01:14:53,572 --> 01:14:56,365
SaI was usually out
doing business.

1021
01:14:56,492 --> 01:14:57,783
He was always stressed.

1022
01:14:59,828 --> 01:15:03,414
But he allowed me to do
whatever I wanted.

1023
01:15:04,124 --> 01:15:07,543
My life had become
comfortable, secure.

1024
01:15:08,712 --> 01:15:13,925
It was like eating cotton candy
all day long.

1025
01:15:18,138 --> 01:15:21,766
What's the matter, Sal? You okay?

1026
01:15:22,434 --> 01:15:23,976
I love you, princess.

1027
01:15:26,104 --> 01:15:28,022
I love you, too.

1028
01:15:29,149 --> 01:15:30,608
Come here.

1029
01:15:39,451 --> 01:15:41,494
I just want you to know

1030
01:15:42,454 --> 01:15:45,873
that you never have to worry
about anything.

1031
01:15:45,999 --> 01:15:48,793
You'll always be taken care of...

1032
01:15:49,294 --> 01:15:52,338
even after I'm gone.

1033
01:15:52,464 --> 01:15:53,965
You're not going anywhere, Sal.

1034
01:15:54,091 --> 01:15:56,384
I know, I know, I know.

1035
01:15:56,969 --> 01:15:58,970
You're becoming an artist,
princess.

1036
01:15:59,096 --> 01:16:00,179
A real artist.

1037
01:16:14,778 --> 01:16:19,865
Did you see everybody staring at you
when we came in? Huh?

1038
01:16:20,117 --> 01:16:21,117
Yeah.

1039
01:16:22,536 --> 01:16:23,578
Are you happy, princess?

1040
01:16:25,497 --> 01:16:27,623
You make me happier
than I've ever been.

1041
01:16:28,041 --> 01:16:29,584
Good. That's what I want to hear.

1042
01:16:35,549 --> 01:16:38,342
Hey, SaI.
Aren't those your friends?

1043
01:16:46,518 --> 01:16:47,351
Yeah.

1044
01:16:47,519 --> 01:16:48,686
Should we go say hello?

1045
01:16:48,979 --> 01:16:51,063
No. Tonight's your night.

1046
01:16:58,780 --> 01:16:59,947
I don't care
what New York says.

1047
01:17:00,073 --> 01:17:02,033
I told you a thousand times,
this is Vegas.

1048
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:04,827
I do things my way here.

1049
01:17:04,953 --> 01:17:07,330
What?

1050
01:17:07,456 --> 01:17:09,206
Yeah. Now? All right.
Come on up. Yeah.

1051
01:17:09,333 --> 01:17:11,542
You want to do it now?
Let's do it now.

1052
01:17:11,668 --> 01:17:13,669
Yeah, okay.

1053
01:17:17,549 --> 01:17:19,008
- Jolene.
- Hmm?

1054
01:17:19,134 --> 01:17:21,552
Jolene, wake up, baby.
Come on, baby, wake up.

1055
01:17:21,678 --> 01:17:22,970
- Ohh.
- Come on.

1056
01:17:23,096 --> 01:17:24,722
I want you to wake up.
All right? Wake up.

1057
01:17:24,848 --> 01:17:25,848
I want you to get dressed.

1058
01:17:25,974 --> 01:17:27,850
I want you to go downstairs
and wait for me, okay?

1059
01:17:27,976 --> 01:17:28,976
Why?

1060
01:17:29,186 --> 01:17:31,270
Because I've got a meeting
with the guys right now.

1061
01:17:31,396 --> 01:17:32,938
- Now?
- Yes, now!

1062
01:17:33,065 --> 01:17:35,149
I can't blow them off anymore.
I got to see them.

1063
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:37,401
I'll just have some juice
and go back to...

1064
01:17:37,527 --> 01:17:39,945
No! You're not staying in bed.

1065
01:17:40,072 --> 01:17:42,907
You're gonna go downstairs,
you're gonna get dressed right now,

1066
01:17:43,033 --> 01:17:44,992
and you're gonna wait for me,
all right?

1067
01:17:45,118 --> 01:17:48,537
And do not come up here
till I come and get you.

1068
01:17:58,006 --> 01:17:59,548
Come on. Come on. Let's go.

1069
01:18:00,092 --> 01:18:02,301
Come on. It's all right.

1070
01:18:02,427 --> 01:18:05,012
It's gonna be all right.
Go ahead.

1071
01:18:05,305 --> 01:18:07,348
Jolene!

1072
01:18:35,877 --> 01:18:38,087
Frankie? Jimmy?

1073
01:18:43,885 --> 01:18:45,386
Sal?

1074
01:18:49,099 --> 01:18:50,224
She's not here!

1075
01:18:50,517 --> 01:18:52,351
Check the other room!

1076
01:18:59,609 --> 01:19:02,236
Life changes fast.

1077
01:19:02,362 --> 01:19:03,696
Lightning strikes,

1078
01:19:03,822 --> 01:19:07,116
and in an instant,
everything that was...

1079
01:19:07,242 --> 01:19:09,452
is not what is.

1080
01:19:09,578 --> 01:19:11,579
And you find yourself
sitting on a rock

1081
01:19:11,705 --> 01:19:14,248
at the edge of the desert,

1082
01:19:14,374 --> 01:19:19,378
hoping some trucker will come by
and feel sorry for you

1083
01:19:19,504 --> 01:19:23,549
before you're found
lying dead there...

1084
01:19:24,259 --> 01:19:28,637
...like any other piece of road kill.

1085
01:19:41,943 --> 01:19:44,737
Two years later,
I was living in Tulsa.

1086
01:19:44,863 --> 01:19:47,698
I waited tables,
shelved library books,

1087
01:19:47,824 --> 01:19:50,659
and eventually landed a job
as a receptionist

1088
01:19:50,786 --> 01:19:53,245
at a firm that leased
oiI-drilling equipment.

1089
01:19:54,372 --> 01:19:56,874
I hadn't been involved
with anyone in a while,

1090
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,959
and it was good for me.

1091
01:19:59,294 --> 01:20:02,046
I was making it on my own.

1092
01:20:06,384 --> 01:20:11,013
Finally, I felt I was right
where I was supposed to be.

1093
01:20:14,559 --> 01:20:16,268
Where are you going
in such a hurry?

1094
01:20:16,394 --> 01:20:17,895
Oh, I'm sorry, Peggy.

1095
01:20:18,021 --> 01:20:20,940
I just got a call for a catering gig,
and I cannot turn it down.

1096
01:20:21,066 --> 01:20:22,858
What about happy hour?

1097
01:20:22,984 --> 01:20:25,027
I'll be happpier making
a quick hundred bucks.

1098
01:20:25,153 --> 01:20:26,862
We'll do it tomorrow?

1099
01:20:26,988 --> 01:20:29,573
But I wanted to get wasted tonight.

1100
01:20:29,699 --> 01:20:31,450
Be brave. Go solo.

1101
01:20:31,576 --> 01:20:35,079
Hey, maybe you'll meet
the man of your dreams.

1102
01:20:47,884 --> 01:20:50,344
There we go.
Thank you, dear.

1103
01:21:03,859 --> 01:21:05,568
- Hi, Burns.
Oh, hi.

1104
01:21:07,529 --> 01:21:10,197
Just when I thought this party
was a totaI bust.

1105
01:21:10,323 --> 01:21:11,490
Excuse me?

1106
01:21:11,616 --> 01:21:13,993
Well, you're the first person
under 60 I've seen here all night,

1107
01:21:14,119 --> 01:21:17,872
and by far the prettiest.

1108
01:21:18,623 --> 01:21:20,583
Wait, wait.
Hold on, hold on.

1109
01:21:24,337 --> 01:21:26,922
You can go fill your tray now.

1110
01:21:35,307 --> 01:21:36,390
Not our pastor.

1111
01:21:37,934 --> 01:21:38,976
Asshole.

1112
01:21:39,936 --> 01:21:41,687
You're allowed to talk to me,
you know.

1113
01:21:43,273 --> 01:21:44,732
We're not supposed to talk
to the guests.

1114
01:21:44,858 --> 01:21:46,942
- Thanks, anyway.
- You're welcome.

1115
01:21:47,068 --> 01:21:48,777
But I'm actually giving you
permission to talk to me.

1116
01:21:50,155 --> 01:21:51,572
I'll keep that in mind.

1117
01:21:51,698 --> 01:21:54,533
Oh, oh, you... you don't know.
This is my parents' house.

1118
01:21:56,912 --> 01:21:58,495
It's a very nice house.

1119
01:21:59,372 --> 01:22:02,082
Bradley, dear, I have been
looking all over for you.

1120
01:22:02,208 --> 01:22:03,125
There's a young lady

1121
01:22:03,293 --> 01:22:04,752
that your father and I
would like you to meet.

1122
01:22:04,878 --> 01:22:06,462
Not now, Mother.
Tell me your name.

1123
01:22:06,588 --> 01:22:08,464
- Bradley.
- Mother, I'm busy.

1124
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:09,548
Tell me your name.

1125
01:22:11,343 --> 01:22:14,637
Jolene.

1126
01:22:14,763 --> 01:22:17,389
Mother, this is Jolene.
Jolene, this is my mother.

1127
01:22:17,515 --> 01:22:22,186
Mother, please give Jolene
your permission to talk to me.

1128
01:22:23,855 --> 01:22:25,731
My name's Brad. Brad Benton.

1129
01:22:25,857 --> 01:22:27,441
I think mother likes you.

1130
01:22:33,156 --> 01:22:36,659
Hmm. Just as I thought.

1131
01:22:36,785 --> 01:22:40,371
Redheads have
their own special scent.

1132
01:22:40,497 --> 01:22:42,706
Kind of like warm milk.

1133
01:22:42,832 --> 01:22:46,210
I've never heard that one before.

1134
01:22:47,462 --> 01:22:48,796
I really have to go.

1135
01:22:55,637 --> 01:22:57,179
She loves me.

1136
01:23:15,573 --> 01:23:20,119
Could you sign right here, Jo-o-lene?

1137
01:23:20,578 --> 01:23:21,870
Wait. Are you sure?

1138
01:23:22,539 --> 01:23:23,664
That's what it says.

1139
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:30,504
Thank you.

1140
01:23:33,174 --> 01:23:34,216
Who are they from?

1141
01:23:34,342 --> 01:23:35,509
I don't have any idea.

1142
01:23:35,635 --> 01:23:37,553
Well, I can tell you.

1143
01:23:38,638 --> 01:23:42,016
"May I have the honor
of your company for dinner tonight?

1144
01:23:42,142 --> 01:23:46,478
Brad G. Benton, 555-5677."

1145
01:23:46,604 --> 01:23:50,107
Oh, my God.
You know Brad Benton?

1146
01:23:50,233 --> 01:23:51,483
Do you know who he is?

1147
01:23:51,609 --> 01:23:53,569
Mnh-mnh.

1148
01:23:53,695 --> 01:23:59,241
Only Brad G. Benton
of Benton International, Inc.?

1149
01:23:59,367 --> 01:24:01,452
H- his family owns
this entire building

1150
01:24:01,578 --> 01:24:03,829
and about half of Tulsa.

1151
01:24:04,372 --> 01:24:06,040
Oh.

1152
01:24:06,207 --> 01:24:07,207
That guy.

1153
01:24:07,667 --> 01:24:09,543
He's richer than God.

1154
01:24:09,669 --> 01:24:10,586
Call him.

1155
01:24:12,088 --> 01:24:14,048
Call him now.
I'll call him for you.

1156
01:24:14,174 --> 01:24:16,633
Oh-ho. Peg, take a breath.

1157
01:24:17,927 --> 01:24:18,761
Are you crazy?

1158
01:24:18,928 --> 01:24:20,596
He's a Benton, for God's sake.

1159
01:24:20,805 --> 01:24:22,890
Well, then, you go ahead
and go out with him.

1160
01:24:23,641 --> 01:24:25,893
Jolene, let me tell you something.

1161
01:24:26,102 --> 01:24:29,480
Nobody says "no"
to a Benton around here,

1162
01:24:29,689 --> 01:24:31,899
especially if you want
to keep your job.

1163
01:24:32,108 --> 01:24:35,069
They wouldn't fire me
for not going out with him.

1164
01:25:03,223 --> 01:25:04,932
Uh, bring us a bottle
of your finest Pinot.

1165
01:25:05,058 --> 01:25:07,142
Of course, Mr. Benton.

1166
01:25:07,268 --> 01:25:08,477
You prefer red, right?

1167
01:25:09,771 --> 01:25:11,480
Actually, I like white.

1168
01:25:11,689 --> 01:25:13,065
Liar.

1169
01:25:14,275 --> 01:25:15,734
What do you think of the club?

1170
01:25:16,027 --> 01:25:18,237
It's not my kind of place,
but for what it is, it's nice.

1171
01:25:18,446 --> 01:25:20,155
I figured you might be impressed.

1172
01:25:20,281 --> 01:25:21,532
I hope you are.

1173
01:25:21,658 --> 01:25:23,951
'Cause I'm certainly impressed
with you, Jolene.

1174
01:25:25,537 --> 01:25:26,203
Thank you.

1175
01:25:26,412 --> 01:25:28,163
I mean, you just...
you just appear into my life,

1176
01:25:28,289 --> 01:25:29,790
and... bam... here we are
all dressed up,

1177
01:25:29,916 --> 01:25:31,375
discussing our favorite wines.

1178
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:35,838
Speaking of which,
where is that incompetent waiter?

1179
01:25:36,881 --> 01:25:39,800
He must be new here.
He doesn't know the score yet.

1180
01:25:41,136 --> 01:25:42,427
Did you forget something?

1181
01:25:43,805 --> 01:25:44,888
No, sir. I'm sorry.

1182
01:25:45,014 --> 01:25:48,517
But we have to go into the cellar
to bring the very finest Pinot noir...

1183
01:25:48,726 --> 01:25:51,186
- Uh-huh.
- As you requested.

1184
01:25:54,524 --> 01:25:56,942
Don't be smart with me, understood?

1185
01:25:57,068 --> 01:25:58,318
Yes, sir. Of course.

1186
01:25:58,444 --> 01:26:00,112
- You're new here, right?
- Yes, sir, I am.

1187
01:26:00,238 --> 01:26:01,780
Right. What's...
what's your name?

1188
01:26:01,990 --> 01:26:03,198
Benjamin, sir.

1189
01:26:03,408 --> 01:26:04,867
Benjamin. Benjamin.

1190
01:26:04,993 --> 01:26:07,411
Well, Benjamin, it's really nice
to have you waiting on us.

1191
01:26:07,537 --> 01:26:08,954
Keep up the great work.

1192
01:26:14,460 --> 01:26:15,919
You always this rude?

1193
01:26:16,921 --> 01:26:18,255
No. No, I'm not like that.

1194
01:26:18,381 --> 01:26:19,715
He deserved it.

1195
01:26:19,841 --> 01:26:20,799
I hope I didn't embarrass you,

1196
01:26:20,925 --> 01:26:23,677
but, really, he'll be
a much better waiter now.

1197
01:26:25,430 --> 01:26:27,931
So, Brad, what exactly is it
you do with your life?

1198
01:26:28,766 --> 01:26:32,060
Well, technically, I'm a stockbroker,
but it's just a hobby.

1199
01:26:32,187 --> 01:26:34,354
I never have to work
another day in my life.

1200
01:26:34,564 --> 01:26:37,149
I make truckloads of money,
get paid ridiculous bonuses

1201
01:26:37,358 --> 01:26:41,069
for no other reason than I'm me.

1202
01:26:41,196 --> 01:26:42,988
But forget about me.
Let's talk about you.

1203
01:26:45,033 --> 01:26:45,991
I feel I must tell you,

1204
01:26:46,117 --> 01:26:48,035
you're one of the strangest people
I've ever met.

1205
01:26:48,244 --> 01:26:49,912
No, I'm not.

1206
01:26:50,038 --> 01:26:52,206
I'm actually really
quite a simple guy.

1207
01:26:53,791 --> 01:26:55,250
I hope this isn't inappropriate,

1208
01:26:55,376 --> 01:26:57,252
but have you accepted
our Lord Jesus Christ

1209
01:26:57,378 --> 01:26:58,879
as your personal savior?

1210
01:27:00,006 --> 01:27:01,924
Are you seriously asking me
that question?

1211
01:27:02,133 --> 01:27:03,884
Yeah, I'm absolutely serious.

1212
01:27:05,595 --> 01:27:07,679
That would be my business, Brad.

1213
01:27:08,014 --> 01:27:09,890
Okay.

1214
01:27:10,016 --> 01:27:12,059
I'm sure we can figure it out, then.

1215
01:27:15,563 --> 01:27:17,481
Oh, listen.
I'm sorry I got a little worked up.

1216
01:27:17,607 --> 01:27:18,982
This is our first date,

1217
01:27:19,108 --> 01:27:20,817
and I really wanted everything
to be perfect.

1218
01:27:20,944 --> 01:27:22,778
Uh, I hope I haven't offended you.

1219
01:27:22,904 --> 01:27:25,948
Oh, quite the contrary, sir.
You were right to complain.

1220
01:27:26,074 --> 01:27:27,491
The evening's on the house.

1221
01:27:27,617 --> 01:27:30,077
Hey, thanks, man.
That's really great.

1222
01:27:30,203 --> 01:27:32,120
Write yourself in a big tip, okay?

1223
01:27:36,042 --> 01:27:38,001
I think we're having
an absolutely fantastic time,

1224
01:27:38,127 --> 01:27:39,920
don't you?

1225
01:27:40,755 --> 01:27:42,172
I think you're absolutely crazy.

1226
01:27:43,341 --> 01:27:45,801
Which means you probably
really like me a lot.

1227
01:27:47,345 --> 01:27:49,137
You're not kidding, are you?

1228
01:27:49,931 --> 01:27:51,682
Why don't you figure that out
on our next date?

1229
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:53,600
Wednesday is great for me.
I hope that works for you.

1230
01:27:53,726 --> 01:27:56,019
Well, I'm gonna have to get back
to you on that.

1231
01:27:58,064 --> 01:28:00,148
I felt blessed the minute I saw you.

1232
01:28:01,943 --> 01:28:04,027
You don't know anything
about me, Brad.

1233
01:28:04,279 --> 01:28:06,363
But I know when my prayers
have been answered.

1234
01:28:09,701 --> 01:28:14,997
At first, I couldn't believe
Brad G. Benton was serious.

1235
01:28:15,123 --> 01:28:18,250
On the other hand,
this was the Bible Belt,

1236
01:28:19,294 --> 01:28:22,587
and I'd met
some very sincere people.

1237
01:28:24,132 --> 01:28:29,011
Though he was a little weird,
Brad was a perfect gentleman.

1238
01:28:29,137 --> 01:28:33,682
He was never inappropriate
and always considerate.

1239
01:28:33,808 --> 01:28:35,642
After a couple more dates,

1240
01:28:35,768 --> 01:28:40,522
I actually started to enjoy
his eccentric personality.

1241
01:28:40,648 --> 01:28:43,650
And he was always
going out of his way

1242
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:44,985
to show me that he cared.

1243
01:28:49,198 --> 01:28:51,366
Where are you taking me?

1244
01:29:18,353 --> 01:29:21,938
What an amazing view.

1245
01:29:23,274 --> 01:29:25,400
Tulsa's so beautiful from up here.

1246
01:29:27,612 --> 01:29:29,112
About as close to heaven
as you can get

1247
01:29:29,238 --> 01:29:32,366
without leaving Oklahoma.

1248
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:58,266
Thank you, Brad.
That's very thoughtful.

1249
01:29:59,060 --> 01:30:00,227
You're welcome.

1250
01:30:04,399 --> 01:30:05,899
Are you as happy as I am?

1251
01:30:06,776 --> 01:30:07,609
Mm-hmm.

1252
01:30:07,819 --> 01:30:10,028
I hope you'll remember today forever.

1253
01:30:10,154 --> 01:30:12,656
I've got a surprise for you.

1254
01:30:18,788 --> 01:30:19,996
What's this?

1255
01:30:20,123 --> 01:30:23,583
I don't know. Open it.
It's addressed to you.

1256
01:30:29,549 --> 01:30:30,590
I fired you from Benton.

1257
01:30:30,716 --> 01:30:32,884
You'll never have to work
another day of your life.

1258
01:30:35,638 --> 01:30:37,431
But I like my job, Brad.

1259
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:39,766
You're not seeing
the big picture here.

1260
01:30:39,892 --> 01:30:41,643
You can make your paintings,
you can raise our kids.

1261
01:30:41,853 --> 01:30:44,020
What's wrong with you?
Why the hell would you fire me?

1262
01:30:44,230 --> 01:30:46,356
Jolene, just calm down and listen.

1263
01:30:46,482 --> 01:30:49,025
The Lord told me that one day
I would meet the right person

1264
01:30:49,152 --> 01:30:50,652
to spend the rest of my life with.

1265
01:30:50,862 --> 01:30:52,612
The Lord also tell you to fire me?

1266
01:30:57,034 --> 01:30:59,453
I want you to be
the happiest woman on earth.

1267
01:31:07,128 --> 01:31:09,296
Will you marry me?
Please say yes.

1268
01:31:10,965 --> 01:31:12,007
Uh...

1269
01:31:15,553 --> 01:31:18,889
It's not that simple.

1270
01:31:19,015 --> 01:31:21,183
You don't know me.

1271
01:31:21,309 --> 01:31:23,351
I want to tell you about my life
before I met you.

1272
01:31:23,478 --> 01:31:25,395
It's... it's important
you know who I am.

1273
01:31:25,605 --> 01:31:27,981
No. What matters is us,
here and now.

1274
01:31:28,107 --> 01:31:28,899
I know I love you,

1275
01:31:29,025 --> 01:31:30,984
and I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

1276
01:31:31,194 --> 01:31:32,194
But, Brad...

1277
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:34,988
That's all I ever want
or need to know.

1278
01:31:35,114 --> 01:31:37,324
I don't care where you've been
or what you've done.

1279
01:31:37,450 --> 01:31:39,868
That's the past.
This is our future.

1280
01:31:40,161 --> 01:31:41,119
Yeah.

1281
01:31:41,245 --> 01:31:42,704
You're skipping a lot of steps here,

1282
01:31:42,830 --> 01:31:45,207
like meeting your parents,
moving in together.

1283
01:31:45,416 --> 01:31:47,584
Jolene, I am asking you to marry me.

1284
01:31:47,835 --> 01:31:50,420
I understand that.
It's very touching.

1285
01:31:50,546 --> 01:31:52,839
It's just, I can't say yes
unless I know I mean it.

1286
01:31:52,965 --> 01:31:55,467
Of course you need time.
I understand that.

1287
01:31:55,593 --> 01:31:57,093
But we can spend
the rest of our lives

1288
01:31:57,220 --> 01:31:58,512
getting to know each other.

1289
01:31:58,721 --> 01:32:02,516
Why complicate something
as beautiful and simple as our love?

1290
01:32:03,226 --> 01:32:05,644
Jolene, we'll be so happy together.

1291
01:32:05,770 --> 01:32:06,728
I swear to God.

1292
01:32:15,988 --> 01:32:17,989
Uh, this is getting too strange.

1293
01:32:18,407 --> 01:32:20,116
Okay, okay.
Wait, wait, wait.

1294
01:32:20,243 --> 01:32:21,952
Listen. I'm sorry.
I know. I know.

1295
01:32:22,078 --> 01:32:23,995
Guys, stop the music!

1296
01:32:24,205 --> 01:32:26,748
Get out of here!
Just go! Leave!

1297
01:32:27,124 --> 01:32:29,376
Now!

1298
01:32:29,919 --> 01:32:31,711
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1299
01:32:32,088 --> 01:32:33,463
Listen to me.

1300
01:32:33,589 --> 01:32:34,881
It's taken me a while to grow up,

1301
01:32:35,049 --> 01:32:36,925
to be ready for something
as special as this.

1302
01:32:37,051 --> 01:32:39,594
You are the first woman
I have ever been in love with,

1303
01:32:39,720 --> 01:32:41,555
and the first
I've ever asked to marry.

1304
01:32:41,889 --> 01:32:43,223
And I know in my heart

1305
01:32:43,349 --> 01:32:45,225
that you will grow to love me
as much as I love you.

1306
01:32:45,351 --> 01:32:48,103
It's so obvious. It's perfect.

1307
01:32:48,229 --> 01:32:51,565
Jolene, I really... I really am
a simple kind of guy.

1308
01:32:53,234 --> 01:32:54,442
That's intense.

1309
01:32:54,652 --> 01:32:56,861
Don't fight it. It's bigger
than both of us. Marry me.

1310
01:32:57,863 --> 01:32:58,655
I can't.

1311
01:32:58,781 --> 01:33:01,366
Yes, of course you can.
Together we can do anything.

1312
01:33:02,118 --> 01:33:05,870
Brad, I can't marry you.

1313
01:33:09,041 --> 01:33:09,666
# Hallelujah #

1314
01:33:09,792 --> 01:33:11,710
I now pronounce you man and wife.

1315
01:33:11,836 --> 01:33:12,877
You may kiss the bride.

1316
01:33:13,004 --> 01:33:14,921
# Hallelujah, hallelujah #

1317
01:33:17,091 --> 01:33:20,927
# Hallelujah #

1318
01:33:21,053 --> 01:33:23,138
# Hallelujah, hallelujah #

1319
01:33:23,264 --> 01:33:25,724
# Hallelujah #

1320
01:33:31,731 --> 01:33:36,568
# Hallelujah, hallelujah #

1321
01:33:36,694 --> 01:33:39,696
Brad, honey,
where are your parents?

1322
01:33:39,822 --> 01:33:41,531
Who cares?

1323
01:33:41,657 --> 01:33:42,699
The Lord's here.

1324
01:33:42,825 --> 01:33:51,124
# Hallelujah, hallelujah #

1325
01:33:51,876 --> 01:34:00,216
# Halle-luja-a-a-ah #

1326
01:34:34,293 --> 01:34:35,752
No, no, no, no.
Brad, please!

1327
01:34:36,879 --> 01:34:38,880
- No, I don't like it there.
- Jolene, shh, shh, shh!

1328
01:34:39,006 --> 01:34:41,132
No, I don't like it there.

1329
01:34:41,258 --> 01:34:42,592
Aah!

1330
01:34:45,054 --> 01:34:45,762
Ew.

1331
01:34:49,558 --> 01:34:52,769
Ah, this is so fucking beautiful.

1332
01:35:12,998 --> 01:35:15,291
Thank you, Travis.

1333
01:35:23,843 --> 01:35:24,801
Who's that?

1334
01:35:25,386 --> 01:35:27,762
That is my father.

1335
01:35:28,139 --> 01:35:29,055
Your father?

1336
01:35:30,015 --> 01:35:31,683
Mm-hmm.

1337
01:35:32,184 --> 01:35:33,560
Brad, shouldn't we go over there?

1338
01:35:33,728 --> 01:35:35,979
Nah. If he wants to meet you,
he can come here.

1339
01:35:37,523 --> 01:35:39,524
But I want to meet your parents.

1340
01:35:40,860 --> 01:35:43,111
It's a complicated thing.

1341
01:35:43,237 --> 01:35:44,237
Trust me.

1342
01:35:50,035 --> 01:35:52,120
They think if they ignore me,
I'll just go away?

1343
01:35:53,372 --> 01:35:56,040
No. It's not really
about you so much.

1344
01:35:56,250 --> 01:35:58,960
What kind of parents don't show up
for their own son's weddin'?

1345
01:35:59,170 --> 01:36:04,299
Proud, inflexible, arrogant ones,
like those two.

1346
01:36:04,425 --> 01:36:05,884
But they're not all that bad.

1347
01:36:09,513 --> 01:36:14,768
Brad, when we have kids,
I want to love them no matter what.

1348
01:36:15,060 --> 01:36:15,852
Oh, we will, honey.

1349
01:36:15,978 --> 01:36:18,062
We're gonna have a huge family,
all of our own.

1350
01:36:19,732 --> 01:36:21,775
- Brad.
- What?

1351
01:36:28,491 --> 01:36:29,073
Are you...?

1352
01:36:29,283 --> 01:36:31,451
Mm-hmm.

1353
01:36:32,119 --> 01:36:32,827
Really?

1354
01:36:32,953 --> 01:36:33,953
Yeah.

1355
01:36:34,163 --> 01:36:35,330
Hallelujah!

1356
01:36:35,539 --> 01:36:36,956
- I'm gonna be a daddy!
- Oh!

1357
01:36:37,166 --> 01:36:40,543
I knew if I wanted
to prove anything to Brad's family,

1358
01:36:40,669 --> 01:36:43,463
if I wanted any kind
of social acceptance in Tulsa,

1359
01:36:44,423 --> 01:36:46,508
I would have to work for it.

1360
01:36:46,717 --> 01:36:51,387
I embraced their style of life,
their manners,

1361
01:36:51,514 --> 01:36:55,475
their ways of doing things,
and I was patient,

1362
01:36:55,601 --> 01:36:57,894
but always kept
my eyes and ears open.

1363
01:36:58,020 --> 01:36:59,020
Excuse me, son.

1364
01:37:00,898 --> 01:37:02,190
It's good to see you.

1365
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:03,691
You too, Dad.

1366
01:37:04,026 --> 01:37:06,110
Uh, Jolene, honey, this is my father.

1367
01:37:06,237 --> 01:37:08,363
It's a pleasure to finally meet you,
Mr. Benton.

1368
01:37:08,614 --> 01:37:09,948
It's very nice meeting you.

1369
01:37:10,074 --> 01:37:13,034
And I believe
you remember my mother.

1370
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:14,911
It's nice to see you again,
Mrs. Benton.

1371
01:37:18,040 --> 01:37:20,416
- So, the baby's due any day now.
- Mm-hmm.

1372
01:37:20,668 --> 01:37:22,335
Is it a boy or a girl?

1373
01:37:22,628 --> 01:37:25,255
A boy.

1374
01:37:34,181 --> 01:37:35,557
- Jolene.
- Hmm?

1375
01:37:35,683 --> 01:37:37,058
Wake up.

1376
01:37:37,184 --> 01:37:38,101
What?

1377
01:37:38,227 --> 01:37:39,352
Wake up.

1378
01:37:39,478 --> 01:37:40,603
Brad, are you all right?

1379
01:37:40,771 --> 01:37:42,188
You've slept with other men,
haven't you?

1380
01:37:46,110 --> 01:37:48,611
What are you talking about?
Why are you asking me this?

1381
01:37:48,821 --> 01:37:51,573
It's just something that's
been bothering me a lot lately.

1382
01:37:52,283 --> 01:37:55,660
But when we first met,
you said that it didn't matter.

1383
01:37:55,786 --> 01:37:58,204
Babe, you were right.

1384
01:37:58,330 --> 01:38:01,833
I tried to tell you,
but you wouldn't listen.

1385
01:38:01,959 --> 01:38:04,252
Why are you interested
all of a sudden?

1386
01:38:04,461 --> 01:38:05,587
Just... just answer the question.

1387
01:38:05,796 --> 01:38:07,255
No. Not until you answer mine.

1388
01:38:07,464 --> 01:38:08,590
How many?

1389
01:38:09,383 --> 01:38:10,967
Are you kidding me?
You want a number?

1390
01:38:11,176 --> 01:38:12,260
How many?!

1391
01:38:12,469 --> 01:38:14,888
You have no right to ask me that
without an explanation.

1392
01:38:16,390 --> 01:38:18,725
There have been that many?

1393
01:38:18,851 --> 01:38:19,517
Wow.

1394
01:38:21,020 --> 01:38:24,606
Brad, you knew I wasn't a virgin
when we married.

1395
01:38:26,108 --> 01:38:29,235
You see, Jolene, it's easy for me.
I can count mine on one hand.

1396
01:38:29,361 --> 01:38:31,946
Now, if you had been with one guy
or maybe even two guys,

1397
01:38:32,072 --> 01:38:33,781
ah, that's the kind of thing
you wouldn't forget.

1398
01:38:33,908 --> 01:38:36,326
But if you'd been with a lot of guys,

1399
01:38:36,452 --> 01:38:39,245
then I guess it gets kind of hard
to keep track of that, right?

1400
01:38:39,455 --> 01:38:40,747
So, what are you saying,

1401
01:38:40,873 --> 01:38:43,625
that five is okay
but six is too many?

1402
01:38:44,919 --> 01:38:46,753
How many have there been?

1403
01:38:46,962 --> 01:38:49,339
Sweetheart, please,
let's just go back to sleep.

1404
01:38:49,548 --> 01:38:50,340
10?

1405
01:38:50,549 --> 01:38:53,343
Brad, please.

1406
01:38:53,469 --> 01:38:55,803
I never loved anybody more
than the way that I love you.

1407
01:38:56,096 --> 01:38:57,055
20, 30, 50?

1408
01:38:57,181 --> 01:39:00,475
Hundreds! Thousands!
Do you feel better?!

1409
01:39:03,437 --> 01:39:07,482
Never mind that I had tried
to tell Brad about my marriages,

1410
01:39:07,775 --> 01:39:10,735
my life on the road...

1411
01:39:10,861 --> 01:39:14,197
he never wanted to hear it.

1412
01:39:15,366 --> 01:39:17,951
Brad, honey?

1413
01:39:23,582 --> 01:39:27,543
I just don't know where all this
is coming from.

1414
01:39:33,884 --> 01:39:36,761
I have nothing to hide.

1415
01:39:37,513 --> 01:39:39,263
If it's that important to you,

1416
01:39:39,473 --> 01:39:40,598
of course...

1417
01:39:41,141 --> 01:39:42,350
Ohh!

1418
01:39:50,150 --> 01:39:55,530
Dear Lord, please bless our family...

1419
01:39:55,656 --> 01:39:58,783
for we have sinned.

1420
01:40:01,996 --> 01:40:04,664
I hurt my wife...

1421
01:40:05,082 --> 01:40:08,459
because she hurt me.

1422
01:40:12,339 --> 01:40:16,134
Sweetheart, I love you more
than anything in the world.

1423
01:40:17,845 --> 01:40:25,393
I will never ever do anything
to hurt you ever again.

1424
01:40:31,066 --> 01:40:35,153
Lord, please, please forgive us.

1425
01:40:42,953 --> 01:40:45,121
It was as if his wildness,

1426
01:40:45,330 --> 01:40:47,915
his independence,

1427
01:40:48,042 --> 01:40:52,628
his personality was being driven
from the Brad I loved.

1428
01:41:34,671 --> 01:41:39,634
For the very first time in my life,
I had something I wanted.

1429
01:41:41,428 --> 01:41:43,638
I was Jolene...

1430
01:41:44,014 --> 01:41:46,724
his mother.

1431
01:41:47,184 --> 01:41:49,769
And I could believe in God now.

1432
01:41:57,111 --> 01:42:00,446
What shall we eat?
I know.

1433
01:42:18,882 --> 01:42:22,093
It was those parents of his
gradually absorbing him

1434
01:42:22,219 --> 01:42:24,262
back into their righteousness.

1435
01:42:25,514 --> 01:42:27,014
Jolene, can you feed him
in the nursery

1436
01:42:27,141 --> 01:42:28,141
or let him go to the nurse?

1437
01:42:28,267 --> 01:42:31,060
- How am I supposed to eat?
- Brad, he was hungry.

1438
01:42:31,186 --> 01:42:33,604
- I'm trying to get him to go to sleep.
- Where the hell is Rosie?

1439
01:42:33,730 --> 01:42:36,190
- We gave her the day off.
- Well, let's get her back.

1440
01:42:36,316 --> 01:42:38,192
We need her to take care
of junior today.

1441
01:42:38,318 --> 01:42:40,736
Grandpa and grandma are coming
to see Mr. Nipplebee today.

1442
01:42:40,863 --> 01:42:42,989
You need to make yourself
presentable.

1443
01:42:43,115 --> 01:42:45,241
What, they're coming today?!

1444
01:42:45,701 --> 01:42:47,160
For lunch.
And to see the Bradley.

1445
01:42:47,286 --> 01:42:49,495
Brad! Why didn't you tell me?

1446
01:42:49,621 --> 01:42:51,080
This place has to be cleaned!

1447
01:42:51,874 --> 01:42:52,623
They just called.

1448
01:42:52,749 --> 01:42:54,167
What was I supposed to say,
that we weren't here?

1449
01:42:54,293 --> 01:42:56,085
Look, I can't see them today.
I've got too much to do.

1450
01:42:56,211 --> 01:42:58,838
That's okay. They probably don't want
to deaI with you anyway.

1451
01:43:01,383 --> 01:43:02,800
That's the truth, isn't it?

1452
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:06,053
Of course it is.
Don't act so surprised.

1453
01:43:08,015 --> 01:43:09,849
Jolene, save the drama
for another day.

1454
01:43:45,719 --> 01:43:47,053
You fucking whore!

1455
01:43:47,804 --> 01:43:48,930
Brad! No!

1456
01:44:22,923 --> 01:44:24,215
Oh, my God!

1457
01:44:24,341 --> 01:44:25,675
Mrs. Benton! Oh, my...!

1458
01:44:28,804 --> 01:44:30,304
Oh, God, what did he do to you?!

1459
01:44:31,390 --> 01:44:32,265
Oh!

1460
01:44:34,059 --> 01:44:36,102
Mrs. Benton, are you okay?

1461
01:45:08,135 --> 01:45:11,262
Aw. Shh.

1462
01:45:14,057 --> 01:45:18,227
The nurse at the hospitaI
didn't need to ask how it happened.

1463
01:45:18,353 --> 01:45:21,564
Shh. Come on.

1464
01:45:21,690 --> 01:45:26,193
She wrote out the name and address
of a women's shelter,

1465
01:45:26,320 --> 01:45:29,363
and the shelter gave me
the name of a lawyer.

1466
01:45:29,906 --> 01:45:33,784
He's a dangerous man.
I can't have him in my life.

1467
01:45:33,910 --> 01:45:35,870
I don't care about the money.
I just want out.

1468
01:45:37,789 --> 01:45:39,582
I'm afraid I'm...

1469
01:45:39,708 --> 01:45:42,335
not going to be able to help you,
Mrs. Benton.

1470
01:45:42,461 --> 01:45:44,378
What do you mean?

1471
01:45:44,504 --> 01:45:46,922
I mean I can't take your case.

1472
01:45:47,841 --> 01:45:48,966
Why?

1473
01:45:51,970 --> 01:45:54,305
Did his family threaten you
or just buy you off?

1474
01:45:54,639 --> 01:45:57,308
This has nothing to do
with the Benton family.

1475
01:45:59,311 --> 01:46:01,645
He beat me. It's simple.

1476
01:46:01,772 --> 01:46:03,898
I'm afraid it's not that simple.

1477
01:46:04,024 --> 01:46:05,399
You didn't tell me you had a past,

1478
01:46:05,525 --> 01:46:07,651
including a stretch
in juvenile detention.

1479
01:46:07,778 --> 01:46:08,778
That was a long time ago.

1480
01:46:08,904 --> 01:46:11,155
To say nothing of a previous
as yet un-annulled marriage

1481
01:46:11,281 --> 01:46:14,867
to a convicted drug dealer.

1482
01:46:14,993 --> 01:46:16,744
You entered into your marriage
with Mr. Benton

1483
01:46:16,870 --> 01:46:20,956
under less than honest
circumstances.

1484
01:46:21,958 --> 01:46:23,376
I'm very sorry.

1485
01:46:23,502 --> 01:46:26,337
No one at this firm
will take your case.

1486
01:46:33,637 --> 01:46:35,679
Oh, my darlin'.

1487
01:46:37,140 --> 01:46:39,225
Uh, Mrs. Benton.

1488
01:46:39,351 --> 01:46:41,185
There's some people here
to see you!

1489
01:46:41,311 --> 01:46:42,812
Come on. Come on.

1490
01:46:42,938 --> 01:46:46,023
Oh! Look at you. Yes.

1491
01:46:50,654 --> 01:46:52,238
What? No, where are you going?
Wait! Stop!

1492
01:46:52,364 --> 01:46:54,615
You... you are under arrest

1493
01:46:54,741 --> 01:46:57,201
for the kidnapping
of Bradley Benton junior!

1494
01:46:57,327 --> 01:47:00,413
- No! No! No!
- Come quietly.

1495
01:47:12,801 --> 01:47:13,884
Come on, lady, move.

1496
01:47:16,054 --> 01:47:18,013
No!

1497
01:47:30,652 --> 01:47:32,778
I know that you feel
like you've been wronged, but...

1498
01:47:32,904 --> 01:47:34,947
Wronged? They took my child.

1499
01:47:35,073 --> 01:47:39,869
Unfortunately, Mrs. Benton,
they have a really solid case.

1500
01:47:39,995 --> 01:47:41,495
I mean, the law clearly states...

1501
01:47:41,621 --> 01:47:43,581
Fuck the law!
No one's taking my child!

1502
01:47:43,707 --> 01:47:44,790
Do you understand that?

1503
01:47:45,125 --> 01:47:47,877
Mrs. Benton, I'm gonna work
really hard on your case.

1504
01:47:48,003 --> 01:47:49,128
I promise.

1505
01:47:50,172 --> 01:47:53,215
The legaI aid guy
was way out of his league,

1506
01:47:53,341 --> 01:47:56,051
and, without giving it
a second thought,

1507
01:47:56,178 --> 01:47:59,263
the judge ruled
that I was an unfit mother

1508
01:47:59,389 --> 01:48:05,102
and granted Brad sole custody
of my little boy.

1509
01:48:05,228 --> 01:48:07,104
I mean, you do have
a checkered past.

1510
01:48:07,230 --> 01:48:08,898
I had choices.

1511
01:48:09,024 --> 01:48:10,649
I think you should hope
for the best, but...

1512
01:48:10,775 --> 01:48:14,069
I could kill Brad G. Benton,

1513
01:48:14,196 --> 01:48:18,157
but then my child would be raised
by the Benton family.

1514
01:48:18,283 --> 01:48:19,492
I could find a job

1515
01:48:19,618 --> 01:48:22,703
and see my baby
every second Sunday for one hour,

1516
01:48:22,829 --> 01:48:25,414
as allowed by the judge,

1517
01:48:25,540 --> 01:48:29,460
and find the right moment
to steaI him back.

1518
01:48:30,045 --> 01:48:31,086
Or I could let him grow up

1519
01:48:31,213 --> 01:48:36,091
thinking I was something other
than an embarrassment,

1520
01:48:36,218 --> 01:48:39,011
a poor relation...

1521
01:48:40,639 --> 01:48:43,724
...or a victim.

1522
01:49:17,884 --> 01:49:22,137
He could daydream
about his real mother...

1523
01:49:24,391 --> 01:49:27,935
...living somewhere out there...

1524
01:49:30,689 --> 01:49:33,691
...away for a time...

1525
01:49:34,276 --> 01:49:38,320
...but never forgotten.

1526
01:49:41,992 --> 01:49:45,244
She'd be beautiful...

1527
01:49:47,205 --> 01:49:50,124
...smart...

1528
01:49:51,376 --> 01:49:56,589
...and more talented
than she could possibly ever be...

1529
01:49:58,550 --> 01:50:01,176
But so reaI to my boy...

1530
01:50:04,389 --> 01:50:07,641
My baby boy...

1531
01:50:10,979 --> 01:50:13,522
My son.

1532
01:50:33,960 --> 01:50:38,130
These days, I have a job illustrating
for a small comic-book company.

1533
01:50:38,256 --> 01:50:40,132
Except they don't call them
comic books.

1534
01:50:40,258 --> 01:50:42,134
They call them graphic novels.

1535
01:50:42,260 --> 01:50:44,928
Because most of them
aren't funny at all.

1536
01:50:45,055 --> 01:50:46,930
They're very serious.

1537
01:50:47,057 --> 01:50:49,099
The guys are gonna flip.

1538
01:50:49,225 --> 01:50:51,727
These are wonderful, Jolene!

1539
01:50:51,853 --> 01:50:54,438
Someone once told me
to draw what you know best.

1540
01:50:54,648 --> 01:50:56,148
Good advice...

1541
01:50:56,274 --> 01:50:56,940
I think.

1542
01:50:59,152 --> 01:51:01,278
Well, I'm out of here.

1543
01:51:01,404 --> 01:51:03,072
Meet you before work tomorrow?

1544
01:51:03,198 --> 01:51:04,531
Farmers' market? Usual time?

1545
01:51:05,408 --> 01:51:06,492
Sounds great, Maya.

1546
01:51:44,739 --> 01:51:47,866
Some ppeopple tell me
that I could act in movies,

1547
01:51:47,992 --> 01:51:52,705
because even though I'm 25,
I look a lot younger.

1548
01:51:52,831 --> 01:51:56,709
And they like my voice that I have,
courtesy of my ex-husband.

1549
01:52:03,883 --> 01:52:07,928
I mean, why not?

1550
01:52:08,054 --> 01:52:10,055
Don't they say
if you wish hard enough,

1551
01:52:10,181 --> 01:52:13,642
your dreams might come true?

1552
01:52:28,908 --> 01:52:35,414
And when I take myself back
to Tulsa in my limousine...

1553
01:52:43,381 --> 01:52:47,801
...Brad Junior would be there
to answer the door...

1554
01:52:48,261 --> 01:52:53,223
...and there would be
his movie-star mother.

1555
01:54:32,323 --> 01:54:36,577
