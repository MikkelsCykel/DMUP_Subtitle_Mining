1
00:01:39,396 --> 00:01:42,699
Launch control is having trouble
verifying mass acceleration.

2
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:47,037
Team Banzai rotational supervisor,
please confirm.

3
00:01:48,505 --> 00:01:52,642
I want an electromagnetic
fuel reading from the launch.

4
00:01:54,477 --> 00:01:59,082
We are T minus seven zero and holding.

5
00:01:59,215 --> 00:02:03,353
Antigravity inertia reversal crosscheck.

6
00:02:05,421 --> 00:02:08,391
Can we have a photographic
printout to the bunker?

7
00:02:08,524 --> 00:02:13,896
T minus six zero three and holding.
Phaser positive. Latch compressor.

8
00:02:14,397 --> 00:02:18,267
Multistage
axial compressor... latched.

9
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,605
Fuel pressure... 1800 torrs.

10
00:02:22,738 --> 00:02:28,577
Commence pullback to
the launch sequence. Clear the launch.

11
00:02:31,246 --> 00:02:34,383
Specific density is 2.5. Over.

12
00:02:34,516 --> 00:02:37,786
You're kidding. He's still at the hospital?

13
00:02:38,954 --> 00:02:41,489
Banzai hasn't showed yet, Mr Secretary.

14
00:02:41,623 --> 00:02:44,459
Looks like he's got cold feet.

15
00:02:44,592 --> 00:02:48,163
Well, better go see what's
keeping the boss, Reno.

16
00:02:48,296 --> 00:02:50,765
Why me?

17
00:02:50,899 --> 00:02:52,634
Cos I'm busy.

18
00:02:54,535 --> 00:02:56,337
May I have the curved Yasargil, please?

19
00:02:56,471 --> 00:02:58,806
It's not here, Dr Banzai.

20
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:01,442
Ah, let me have the straight one then.

21
00:03:01,576 --> 00:03:03,844
See, this is the part where for me
it started looking like a problem.

22
00:03:03,978 --> 00:03:08,249
I mean, I wanted to sacrifice the precentral
vein in order to get some exposure.

23
00:03:08,382 --> 00:03:11,685
But because of this guy's normal variation,
I got excited and all the sudden I didn't know

24
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:15,456
whether I was looking at the precentral vein or one
of the internal cerebro veins or the Vein of Galen

25
00:03:15,589 --> 00:03:19,660
or the Basilar vein of Rosenthal, so one my own me at
this point I was ready to say "That's it, let's get out".

26
00:03:19,793 --> 00:03:22,863
See, you can check
your anatomy all you want,

27
00:03:22,996 --> 00:03:25,665
and even though there may be normal
variation, if you get right down to it,

28
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:28,635
this far inside the head,
it all looks the same.

29
00:03:28,768 --> 00:03:31,838
No, no, no. Don't tug on that.
You never know what it might be attached to.

30
00:03:35,508 --> 00:03:38,845
This is control.
02 vents are closed. Looks good.

31
00:03:39,345 --> 00:03:42,815
Dr Banzai is using the laser
to vaporise a pineal tumour

32
00:03:42,949 --> 00:03:45,618
without damaging
the quadrigeminal plate.

33
00:03:45,752 --> 00:03:48,654
Subcutaneous microphone gonna
allow the patient to transmit

34
00:03:48,788 --> 00:03:51,324
verbal instructions to his own brain.

35
00:03:51,457 --> 00:03:56,195
- Like "Raise my left arm"?
- Or "Throw the harpoon".

36
00:03:56,328 --> 00:03:59,365
People are gonna come from all over.
This boy's an Eskimo.

37
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:03,636
You ever thought about
joining me full time?

38
00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:05,838
What do you mean? You serious?
Do you have an opening?

39
00:04:05,971 --> 00:04:09,842
Uh-huh. Can you sing?

40
00:04:09,975 --> 00:04:12,744
A little. Yeah. I can dance.

41
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:14,379
Hey, it's Buckaroo.

42
00:04:14,513 --> 00:04:17,582
We have Buckaroo descending.
We have him on the launch parameter.

43
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:23,555
Inertial control positive.
T minus five four five. Resume counting.

44
00:04:23,688 --> 00:04:25,357
Hey, hey, Rawhide!

45
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:29,494
All systems righteous.
Professor Hikita says we have a go.

46
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:44,408
I'm teeing off in an hour and a half.
What's this jalopy supposed to do anyway?

47
00:04:44,542 --> 00:04:48,245
- 500 miles an hour, General.
- Oh, Senator, you're so gullible.

48
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:57,821
Please clear the launch grid.
Please clear the launch grid.

49
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:05,062
HB 88, this is control.
Driver's door check secure.

50
00:05:05,429 --> 00:05:09,132
...B, C, D, E...
- Clear the area!

51
00:05:11,735 --> 00:05:15,305
Control, this is HB 88.
Commander's voice check. Over.

52
00:05:15,438 --> 00:05:17,674
Roger, HB 88. Read you. Out.

53
00:05:17,841 --> 00:05:21,578
Control, this is HB 88.
Event timer started. Over.

54
00:05:21,711 --> 00:05:25,248
HB 88, this is control.
APU start is go.

55
00:05:25,381 --> 00:05:27,784
You are on your
on-board computer. Over.

56
00:05:27,917 --> 00:05:29,285
Roger, I copy.

57
00:05:29,418 --> 00:05:34,390
- Altimeters? Compasses?
- Set and crosschecked.

58
00:05:36,659 --> 00:05:39,528
- Reserve brake system two?
- Closed and guarded.

59
00:05:39,695 --> 00:05:41,430
- Gear handle?
- Down and in.

60
00:05:41,564 --> 00:05:43,799
- Throttles and start levers?
- Closed, off.

61
00:05:43,932 --> 00:05:47,302
- Number four electric hydraulic pump and press?
- On and checked.

62
00:05:47,436 --> 00:05:49,238
- Parking brake?
- Set. Press checked.

63
00:05:49,338 --> 00:05:52,808
- Radios, radar and transponder?
- Set and stand by.

64
00:05:58,647 --> 00:06:02,584
HB 88, this is control.
IMU alignment in progress.

65
00:06:02,684 --> 00:06:05,453
We show 28 degrees, 36 minutes.

66
00:06:05,587 --> 00:06:11,092
30.32 seconds north...
by 80 degrees, 36 minutes.

67
00:06:11,192 --> 00:06:15,063
- 14.8 seconds west.
- Synchro is aligned.

68
00:06:15,196 --> 00:06:19,200
HB 88, this is control.
Ground crew secure. Over.

69
00:06:44,825 --> 00:06:48,995
- INS ram coordinates.
- Form one, fuel ticket?

70
00:06:49,129 --> 00:06:52,198
- On board.
- Circuit breakers?

71
00:06:52,332 --> 00:06:55,935
Point of no return. Five, four, three...

72
00:06:56,069 --> 00:06:59,205
- We have main engine start.
...two, one.

73
00:07:09,849 --> 00:07:12,318
Electronuclear carburation seems fine.

74
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:19,925
He's fast. I'll give Banzai that. But one
heat-seeking missile and he's history.

75
00:07:20,059 --> 00:07:23,696
This is control. APU start is go.

76
00:07:23,829 --> 00:07:27,599
You're on your on-board computer. Over.

77
00:07:27,733 --> 00:07:32,471
They are reading you on the localiser
downrange. Looks good. Over.

78
00:07:32,604 --> 00:07:34,706
HB 88, this is control.

79
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:39,477
Speed steady at 317 nautical.
400 and accelerating!

80
00:07:41,546 --> 00:07:44,983
Horizontal velocity is expanding. Over.

81
00:07:48,953 --> 00:07:51,556
- Four... three...
- Here he comes.

82
00:07:51,689 --> 00:07:54,592
...two... one.

83
00:07:54,726 --> 00:07:57,395
- Where's he going?
- Yeah!

84
00:07:59,363 --> 00:08:02,300
He is off course.
This is Chase One. Over.

85
00:08:02,433 --> 00:08:04,235
He has broken trajectory...

86
00:08:04,368 --> 00:08:08,472
50 cylinder. There is an immediate
fire hazard. Do you read?

87
00:08:08,606 --> 00:08:10,574
- Roger.
- Do you read?

88
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:14,611
Advise you abort. Over.
Repeat: Advise you cancel phase two!

89
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:18,482
- What the hell's phase two?
- That's a big no-can-do.

90
00:08:21,985 --> 00:08:25,455
Buckaroo, are you decompressing? Over.

91
00:08:26,289 --> 00:08:29,459
- He's broken the sound barrier!
- Mach 1.3.

92
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:33,930
Buckaroo, do you read?
Commence braking procedure. Over.

93
00:08:34,064 --> 00:08:36,466
Just be cool. She'll hold.

94
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,703
Axis negative.
Pneumatic pressure negative.

95
00:08:40,837 --> 00:08:43,172
We are looking at 500 degrees...

96
00:08:43,306 --> 00:08:47,009
We are in pursuit.
He is gaining. Over.

97
00:08:47,143 --> 00:08:49,545
He's headed for the mountains!

98
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:51,280
Eject, Buckaroo! Eject!

99
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:59,021
HB 88, do you read? Do you read? Over.
This is control. Do you read?

100
00:09:00,522 --> 00:09:02,925
Unsafe levels of...

101
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:07,396
Standby recirculation has been activated.

102
00:09:09,331 --> 00:09:12,301
HB 88, this is control. Do you...

103
00:09:16,605 --> 00:09:20,242
Hotel Brava 88 do you read?
Do you read? Over.

104
00:09:21,142 --> 00:09:25,547
- What is going on?
- It's off my scope.

105
00:09:33,955 --> 00:09:37,892
This is Chase One. We got his tracks.
They go right up to a wall of rock.

106
00:09:38,025 --> 00:09:39,594
Holy shit!

107
00:10:12,292 --> 00:10:17,430
This is Chase Two. Chase Two.
We see him. We see him.

108
00:10:17,931 --> 00:10:21,267
We have him. Chase Two reports
a visual 100 miles off course.

109
00:10:21,401 --> 00:10:22,302
Banzai!

110
00:10:24,771 --> 00:10:27,573
He's gone through it.
He's gone through the mountain.

111
00:10:27,707 --> 00:10:29,976
It has deployed there.

112
00:10:32,044 --> 00:10:35,881
There is a minimal disturbance
in the electromagnetic field.

113
00:10:36,015 --> 00:10:38,884
Antigravity inertia is normal.

114
00:10:39,018 --> 00:10:42,621
Mass acceleration is diminishing. Over.

115
00:10:42,755 --> 00:10:44,323
He is OK.

116
00:10:44,456 --> 00:10:49,061
The vehicle is hot, but we are
showing no radioactivity. Over.

117
00:10:49,194 --> 00:10:54,099
HB 88, this is control. We see you.
Welcome home. Over.

118
00:10:54,232 --> 00:10:57,636
We show electrical-field aberrations
on the windshield.

119
00:10:57,769 --> 00:11:03,174
We are getting a localised vibration
of the drive train and a minor oil leak.

120
00:11:03,308 --> 00:11:06,244
Buckaroo, can you verify
operational capability?

121
00:11:12,617 --> 00:11:13,985
HB 88, this is control.

122
00:11:14,118 --> 00:11:17,421
We are reading an electrical
field aberration of 993

123
00:11:17,555 --> 00:11:21,626
on your windshield, static and fracture.
Can you confirm? Over.

124
00:11:32,269 --> 00:11:35,606
HB 88, this is control.
Do you hear me? Over.

125
00:11:35,739 --> 00:11:41,712
We are getting localised vibration on
your drive shaft. Can you verify? Over.

126
00:11:51,788 --> 00:11:57,327
HB 88, a retrieval vehicle
will rendezvous in ten minutes. Over.

127
00:12:07,804 --> 00:12:12,108
Well, there it is,
tyre tracks right up to a wall of rock.

128
00:12:12,275 --> 00:12:15,878
Perfect Tommy, Rawhide, Reno -

129
00:12:16,011 --> 00:12:20,983
cute guys of the Hong Kong Cavaliers,
Buckaroo's most trusted inner circle.

130
00:12:21,917 --> 00:12:25,888
Could you elaborate on that device,
I believe, dubbed the "oscillator"...

131
00:12:26,021 --> 00:12:29,525
- Oscillation overthruster.
- Hikita!

132
00:12:29,658 --> 00:12:33,595
- Thank you, Allison.
- That dirty little Asian critter!

133
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:43,071
Tranquillisers are being dispensed
to all patients between 10 and 11 am,

134
00:12:43,204 --> 00:12:46,708
Tuesday, Friday and Wednesday.

135
00:12:54,349 --> 00:12:58,452
The sound barrier crumbles,
and then the dimension barrier.

136
00:12:58,586 --> 00:13:05,059
It was, Buckaroo Banzai said, exactly like
Professor Hikita had glimpsed in 1938

137
00:13:05,192 --> 00:13:10,864
through the overthruster he and Dr Emilio
Lizardo put together from spare parts

138
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:13,300
in a laboratory at Princeton.

139
00:13:13,434 --> 00:13:18,438
1938. Can you imagine what it
must have been like then?

140
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:32,485
Molto grazie, Dr Lizardo.

141
00:13:33,153 --> 00:13:37,490
Almost ready, Dr Lizardo! Almost.

142
00:13:59,178 --> 00:14:02,481
Electromagnets, they are charging.

143
00:14:02,615 --> 00:14:05,317
Catapult, she's wired!

144
00:14:06,151 --> 00:14:09,922
No. Not yet. No!

145
00:14:11,089 --> 00:14:12,557
Whoo!

146
00:14:13,592 --> 00:14:16,128
No, not yet! Not yet! I'm not ready!

147
00:14:37,181 --> 00:14:40,451
- He did not go through the wall.

148
00:14:46,824 --> 00:14:48,926
Holy Toledo!

149
00:14:53,797 --> 00:14:56,633
Facile. Sotto, dottor.

150
00:15:07,477 --> 00:15:09,279
Emilio?

151
00:15:29,065 --> 00:15:31,834
...asked what he saw,
asked where he went,

152
00:15:31,934 --> 00:15:37,473
Dr Banzai replied "Vast chasms
of hissing swamp, spurts of flame,

153
00:15:37,606 --> 00:15:41,076
huge thunderclaps
and gurgling rock formations."

154
00:15:42,177 --> 00:15:46,615
Lithium is no longer
available on credit.

155
00:15:50,552 --> 00:15:53,155
G-sub-E...

156
00:15:53,288 --> 00:15:58,226
Gesù Cristo, make the ganglia twitch.
We're home free.

157
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:04,299
Home... home is where
you wear your hat.

158
00:16:04,432 --> 00:16:08,770
I feel so break up, I want to go home!

159
00:16:08,903 --> 00:16:13,308
Hello, Doc. Who are we today?
Albert Einstein?

160
00:16:13,441 --> 00:16:16,444
No. Lord John Whorfin.

161
00:16:16,577 --> 00:16:20,448
If there's one thing I hate,
it's to be mistaken for somebody else.

162
00:16:20,581 --> 00:16:25,720
Cheer up, Lizardo. It's Friday. I got
a care package from your yo-yo friends.

163
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:29,456
Hey, Signore...

164
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:31,859
grazie tanto.

165
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:33,961
Thanks, Doc.

166
00:16:34,094 --> 00:16:37,264
I come for your TV.
You've been using too much juice.

167
00:16:37,397 --> 00:16:40,400
Another 10,000 kilowatts
again this month.

168
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,670
It beats me how an old homicidal
loony can use that much power.

169
00:16:43,804 --> 00:16:46,673
Go on, take it! I don't need it!

170
00:16:46,807 --> 00:16:52,612
Tomorrow I'm goin' home
with my overthruster.

171
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:57,383
That's terrific, Doc.

172
00:16:57,517 --> 00:17:00,853
I'll make sure you get
an early wake-up call.

173
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:06,125
Laugh while you can, monkey boy.

174
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:20,539
Buckaroo, I've done
a spectrographic analysis

175
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:24,843
on the specimen you pulled
off the jet car drive shaft.

176
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:27,746
Rawhide, what do you think?

177
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,082
I don't care if you walked
through a mountain in Texas.

178
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:35,053
This is New Jersey, and when you
play my joint, you're just another act.

179
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:40,058
- I want some music out of you.
- You want it, Artie? You got it.

180
00:17:44,162 --> 00:17:45,230
Let's rock and roll!

181
00:17:50,268 --> 00:17:54,505
Ladies and gentlemen, Artie's Artery
is proud to present for a single night only,

182
00:17:54,605 --> 00:17:58,376
New Brunswick's own,
the one, the only, the amazing...

183
00:17:58,509 --> 00:18:02,413
Buckaroo Banzai and
the Hong Kong Cavaliers!

184
00:19:13,415 --> 00:19:15,350
Excuse me.

185
00:19:17,219 --> 00:19:20,522
Excuse me, is someone out there
not having a good time?

186
00:19:24,759 --> 00:19:27,162
Is somebody...

187
00:19:27,295 --> 00:19:29,664
is somebody crying...

188
00:19:29,797 --> 00:19:32,100
out there in the darkness?

189
00:19:33,001 --> 00:19:34,869
Somebody crying?

190
00:19:35,002 --> 00:19:38,406
Over here. I'm sorry.

191
00:19:39,574 --> 00:19:45,413
Um, could we get... could we
get her a mike and a spotlight?

192
00:19:45,579 --> 00:19:48,516
Tommy, could we run her a mike?

193
00:19:49,617 --> 00:19:53,754
- What, are you serious?
- Yeah, run her over a mike.

194
00:19:56,657 --> 00:19:58,992
What's your name?

195
00:19:59,126 --> 00:20:01,228
- Who cares?
- Right.

196
00:20:01,361 --> 00:20:03,764
Well, I care. What's your name?

197
00:20:08,602 --> 00:20:11,204
- Penny.
- Did you say Peggy?

198
00:20:12,372 --> 00:20:15,241
No. My name's Penny. Penny Priddy.

199
00:20:17,377 --> 00:20:20,313
That doesn't matter.
It's not important.

200
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:26,919
I just... I just sponged up
a little too much Vat 69, that's all.

201
00:20:27,987 --> 00:20:31,324
I'm down to my last nickel
in this lousy town,

202
00:20:31,424 --> 00:20:33,826
and they wouldn't take
my luggage in hock.

203
00:20:33,926 --> 00:20:36,462
I lost my room at the Y this morning.

204
00:20:40,566 --> 00:20:42,601
But it's cool.

205
00:20:42,735 --> 00:20:46,238
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, now.

206
00:20:46,371 --> 00:20:48,707
Don't be mean.

207
00:20:48,841 --> 00:20:53,145
We don't have to be mean,
cos, remember...

208
00:20:53,712 --> 00:20:58,583
no matter where you go...
there you are.

209
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:21,639
- I'm gonna sing this song for you, Peggy.
- No, Penny! Who cares?

210
00:21:27,211 --> 00:21:34,885
I don't have plans and schemes...

211
00:21:34,985 --> 00:21:37,621
And I...

212
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:42,659
Don't have hopes and dreams...

213
00:21:42,793 --> 00:21:49,533
I don't have anything...

214
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:51,434
- This is weird.
- Sure is.

215
00:21:51,568 --> 00:21:56,906
Since I don't have you...

216
00:21:58,441 --> 00:22:01,177
- Yeah, I...
- Who's the girl?

217
00:22:01,311 --> 00:22:06,315
Don't have fond desires...

218
00:22:06,449 --> 00:22:13,956
I don't have happy hours...

219
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:21,263
I don't have anything...

220
00:22:28,003 --> 00:22:32,541
- Get her outta here now! Let's go!
- Let me go! Let me go, you freaks!

221
00:22:32,674 --> 00:22:36,611
- Wait. Wait a minute. Wait.
- Kill that spot. Kill it!

222
00:22:41,216 --> 00:22:45,920
...festive briefing by the
Banzai Institute. Tomorrow...

223
00:22:46,821 --> 00:22:48,857
Where you think you're going, Doc? The moon?

224
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:52,360
- No, no. Planet Ten.
- Planet Ten. Why, pray tell?

225
00:22:52,493 --> 00:22:54,495
- Operator?
- Doc, put down the phone.

226
00:22:54,629 --> 00:22:59,400
Operator? I wanna make a call
to a Mr John Bigbooty

227
00:22:59,534 --> 00:23:04,905
at Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems
over in Grover's Mill.

228
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,609
And you tell him that
it's John Whorfin calling.

229
00:23:08,742 --> 00:23:12,112
That's W-H-O-R-F-l-N.
You got that, honey?

230
00:23:12,246 --> 00:23:16,216
- John. J-O-H-N.
- This better be collect, Doc.

231
00:23:22,856 --> 00:23:28,695
Bigbooty? Of course it's me, you fool!
Who do you think?

232
00:23:28,829 --> 00:23:31,264
The time has come, Bigbooty.

233
00:23:31,398 --> 00:23:33,767
Prepare for my return.

234
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:37,904
Well, haven't you heard?
Don't you watch TV?

235
00:23:38,037 --> 00:23:43,810
Banzai and Hikita have done it.
They have opened the window!

236
00:23:44,777 --> 00:23:49,115
Si. Si. So meet me at the factory.

237
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:52,318
And get their overthruster.

238
00:23:52,451 --> 00:23:54,420
And Hikita, too.

239
00:23:54,553 --> 00:23:56,856
Sure. Alive.

240
00:23:57,022 --> 00:24:01,627
No, no, don't worry about me.
I'll get my own ride.

241
00:24:09,635 --> 00:24:14,673
Evil will not prevail. That was...

242
00:24:17,876 --> 00:24:20,645
Arrivederci, Jersey.

243
00:24:20,779 --> 00:24:24,015
Goodbye, goodbye to her...

244
00:24:30,054 --> 00:24:33,891
- It's the spittin' image.
- Doesn't look anything like her.

245
00:24:34,058 --> 00:24:35,860
Pictures don't lie.

246
00:24:35,993 --> 00:24:40,164
Hell they don't. Met my first wife that way.

247
00:24:40,998 --> 00:24:45,002
It's Peggy to these eyes. It's the
same nose. It's the same hair.

248
00:24:45,136 --> 00:24:48,005
Plus, Buckaroo has to think so too
or else he wouldn't be ready

249
00:24:48,139 --> 00:24:50,374
to make a fool of himself.

250
00:24:55,979 --> 00:24:59,650
Just hot off the World Watch Wire, Buckaroo.
Thought you'd wanna be notified.

251
00:24:59,783 --> 00:25:02,653
Remember that old Italian pal
of the professor's?

252
00:25:02,786 --> 00:25:04,354
- Emilio Lizardo.
- Yeah.

253
00:25:04,488 --> 00:25:08,558
Last night he kills a guard, breaks out of
Trenton Home for the Criminally Insane.

254
00:25:08,692 --> 00:25:12,329
Ten minutes later, he cops a Maserati
Bora. Totalled it a block away.

255
00:25:12,462 --> 00:25:13,663
Holy moly.

256
00:25:13,797 --> 00:25:17,367
- Maserati Bora.
- Mm-hm. That ain't all.

257
00:25:18,034 --> 00:25:20,270
He's vanished. Thin air.

258
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:26,142
- Dr Lizardo. Wasn't he on TV once?
- You're thinking of Mr Wizard.

259
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:29,245
This guy is a
top scientist, dummkopf.

260
00:25:29,378 --> 00:25:34,683
- So was Mr Wizard.
- Dr Emilio Lizardo is a raving lunatic, Perfect Tommy.

261
00:25:34,817 --> 00:25:38,854
A vicious psychopath.
Just as soon kill you as go fishin'.

262
00:25:43,726 --> 00:25:45,894
Buckaroo, look at this.

263
00:25:46,028 --> 00:25:50,098
Grossly-abnormal high-altitude
electrostatic disturbance

264
00:25:50,232 --> 00:25:53,602
- moving down over Connecticut.
- From the jet car, do you think?

265
00:25:53,735 --> 00:25:56,705
No, not from the jet car.
Check with NORAD Command.

266
00:25:56,838 --> 00:26:01,876
It could be above-ground atomic testing
in China. Maybe sunspot activity.

267
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:03,445
Man, that's strange.

268
00:26:07,182 --> 00:26:09,617
Scientists at Strategious Space Command have detected

269
00:26:09,751 --> 00:26:13,755
a mysterious radioactive cloudlike
mass over southern New England.

270
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:18,192
Sources close to the National Security
Consortium have refused to comment.

271
00:26:18,292 --> 00:26:23,964
Let's get on back to three
great modern country hits in a row.

272
00:26:27,101 --> 00:26:28,235
- Sidney!
- Buckaroo!

273
00:26:28,369 --> 00:26:30,838
- How's the patient?
- Fine, thanks to you.

274
00:26:30,971 --> 00:26:32,940
- But more importantly: Congratulations!
- Thank you.

275
00:26:33,073 --> 00:26:35,609
You drove right through
a mountain the other day.

276
00:26:35,743 --> 00:26:38,645
You did it right after you left me at the operation.
You haven't even said anything about it.

277
00:26:38,779 --> 00:26:40,948
- Didn't mention it.
- Sidney, these are my friends.

278
00:26:41,081 --> 00:26:44,751
This is my colleague Dr Sidney Zwibel, old
medical friend from Columbia P and S.

279
00:26:44,885 --> 00:26:47,120
- Howdy. How you're doing?
- Listen, Sidney, I'm glad you could make it.

280
00:26:47,254 --> 00:26:49,656
Cos it looks like we may need an
extra hand sooner than I thought.

281
00:26:49,789 --> 00:26:51,825
Aha, I see. That's what I was wondering about.

282
00:26:51,958 --> 00:26:55,495
I got your message about rendezvousing
at this address. Barely had time to pack.

283
00:26:55,628 --> 00:26:57,931
- Then I came here...
- I can see that.

284
00:26:58,064 --> 00:27:00,500
I'm gonna snoop around.
Make yourself at home.

285
00:27:03,936 --> 00:27:06,606
You know, I thought we were gonna
rehearse or something.

286
00:27:06,939 --> 00:27:10,509
I'm a big fan of all you guys. I love
the comic books and the records.

287
00:27:10,643 --> 00:27:12,478
I know you. You're Pecos.

288
00:27:12,611 --> 00:27:15,981
- Perfect Tommy.
- Perfect Tommy. I'm sorry.

289
00:27:16,115 --> 00:27:19,618
- You're Pecos.
- Pecos is in Tibet. Name's Reno.

290
00:27:19,752 --> 00:27:22,421
- Reno! It's an honour.
- Where do you hail from, Doc?

291
00:27:22,521 --> 00:27:26,125
- Uh, New Jersey. Fort Lee.
- Where are your spurs at?

292
00:27:26,258 --> 00:27:27,693
Is he making fun of me?

293
00:27:30,929 --> 00:27:33,865
Third cell to the left. Pink dress.

294
00:27:33,999 --> 00:27:35,634
Arigato.

295
00:27:47,112 --> 00:27:51,849
What do you want? Huh?
What are you doin' here?

296
00:27:51,983 --> 00:27:55,219
What are you doing here?

297
00:27:55,353 --> 00:27:58,222
Why don't you just go away
and let me rot?

298
00:28:00,825 --> 00:28:04,161
Who were you really trying
to annihilate last night?

299
00:28:05,129 --> 00:28:08,899
You. Just like the papers all say.

300
00:28:11,502 --> 00:28:13,637
Come over here.

301
00:28:15,205 --> 00:28:17,774
Come on.

302
00:28:17,908 --> 00:28:22,212
Oh, my God! Perfect Tommy!

303
00:28:27,818 --> 00:28:29,286
What do you want from me?

304
00:28:31,588 --> 00:28:36,259
Oh, you remind me of someone
I once knew long ago.

305
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:42,832
Was she very beautiful?

306
00:28:44,367 --> 00:28:48,404
She was... queen of the Netherlands.

307
00:28:48,538 --> 00:28:50,940
That's a long way
from where I come from.

308
00:28:51,073 --> 00:28:54,577
Wyoming? Cody, Wyoming?

309
00:28:55,544 --> 00:28:58,414
No, I'm from Laramie.

310
00:28:58,547 --> 00:29:01,417
Except that I was born in Cody,
but nobody...

311
00:29:02,051 --> 00:29:04,753
Do you have family?
Back in Cody, I mean?

312
00:29:04,887 --> 00:29:07,089
I don't know.

313
00:29:07,222 --> 00:29:11,226
See, I always felt that there was
another part of me somewhere.

314
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,595
Another part of you?

315
00:29:13,729 --> 00:29:16,164
Somewhere, yeah.

316
00:29:17,098 --> 00:29:19,267
I'm adopted.

317
00:29:19,401 --> 00:29:21,236
Of course!

318
00:29:21,369 --> 00:29:24,539
If it was a snake, it'd have bit me!

319
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:27,008
- Another you.
- Anything's possible.

320
00:29:27,142 --> 00:29:29,777
- Let her out!
- Hey, me too.

321
00:29:29,911 --> 00:29:33,314
- Let her out?
- Yeah, let her out. I'll be responsible.

322
00:29:33,448 --> 00:29:36,584
- She's a killer!
- No, she's not. And give her your coat.

323
00:29:37,251 --> 00:29:39,220
Why me?

324
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,522
Because you're perfect.

325
00:29:43,491 --> 00:29:45,192
You have a point there.

326
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:52,966
I'd like to move this thing along.

327
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:57,805
Perhaps some of you noticed we have
a motorcycle convention rolling in here.

328
00:29:57,938 --> 00:30:00,374
We're a little short of time.

329
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:04,111
Besides, I don't imagine you
came here to listen to me talk.

330
00:30:04,244 --> 00:30:06,313
You're right.

331
00:30:10,283 --> 00:30:13,720
Without further ado, I'd like
to introduce a young man

332
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:19,058
who yesterday took our notions
of reality and turned them inside out.

333
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:23,429
Dr Buckaroo Banzai,
perhaps you can explain yourself.

334
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:29,168
Ooh.

335
00:30:29,635 --> 00:30:34,173
Secretary, Senator Cunningham...
members of the world press.

336
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:39,144
30 years ago, almost to this day, my mother and
father, Doctors Sandra and Masado Banzai

337
00:30:39,278 --> 00:30:43,048
gave their lives for what was then
considered to be a very insane notion...

338
00:30:43,182 --> 00:30:47,686
the possibility of contacting alien life.

339
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:52,557
However, not on another planet. But here.

340
00:30:52,691 --> 00:30:55,994
Maybe right inside this table...

341
00:30:56,128 --> 00:31:00,365
living on a simultaneous plane
of existence with our own.

342
00:31:00,865 --> 00:31:03,501
Perhaps within a mountain.

343
00:31:05,403 --> 00:31:08,840
See this rock? It's solid matter, right?

344
00:31:08,973 --> 00:31:13,878
But the solid parts of this rock - the
neutrons, quarks, protons and electrons -

345
00:31:14,012 --> 00:31:15,513
comprise only about

346
00:31:15,646 --> 00:31:18,482
one quadrillionth of its total volume.

347
00:31:18,583 --> 00:31:20,785
- How many zeros is that?
- Quite a few.

348
00:31:21,719 --> 00:31:24,288
The rest of this rock
is actually empty space.

349
00:31:24,422 --> 00:31:28,125
So, back in 1937, Professor Hikita here
and Dr Emilio Lizardo

350
00:31:28,259 --> 00:31:31,795
figured that if solid matter
were mostly just empty space,

351
00:31:31,929 --> 00:31:36,233
a person should be able to discover
a way to travel inside things.

352
00:31:36,366 --> 00:31:40,604
We at the Banzai Institute
have at last found that way.

353
00:31:40,737 --> 00:31:43,573
We have created a device

354
00:31:43,707 --> 00:31:47,210
called an oscillation overthruster,

355
00:31:47,344 --> 00:31:51,147
which systematically reorders matter

356
00:31:51,281 --> 00:31:55,752
by annihilating electrons, positrons...

357
00:31:55,885 --> 00:31:59,656
I get it. What you're saying is that
oppositely-charged particles collide,

358
00:31:59,789 --> 00:32:04,660
and blow each other up in a burst of energy.
Like a tiny big bang, like a... baby bang.

359
00:32:07,063 --> 00:32:10,766
I'm probably just stating the very obvious.
Shut up, Penny. Shut up.

360
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:14,937
Oh, no. It's not obvious at all. If it was obvious,
everybody would be doing it every day.

361
00:32:15,071 --> 00:32:19,542
See, by all accounts, it appears as though
I literally went right through a mountain.

362
00:32:19,675 --> 00:32:23,645
But you could take that mountain
and pulverise it...

363
00:32:23,779 --> 00:32:28,784
and sift through it like breadcrumbs
for the rest of your natural life...

364
00:32:28,917 --> 00:32:34,289
and you would never ever find... this.

365
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:40,495
And yet this living organism came out
of that mountain in Texas with me.

366
00:32:40,629 --> 00:32:44,499
Even though I was never
inside that mountain.

367
00:32:45,233 --> 00:32:46,634
The president's calling.

368
00:32:46,768 --> 00:32:49,971
- The president of what?
- The president of the United States.

369
00:32:50,104 --> 00:32:52,473
Oh. Here.

370
00:32:52,607 --> 00:32:53,841
Later.

371
00:32:53,975 --> 00:32:58,145
- Is he still delirious?
- I can't tell. It's real fuzzy. I patched him
through to a payphone down the hall.

372
00:32:58,279 --> 00:33:02,383
- Do your thing.
- Buckaroo, you forgot your thruster.

373
00:33:02,516 --> 00:33:05,386
Why don't you hold onto it for a while?

374
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:07,354
Any time.

375
00:33:07,488 --> 00:33:10,024
Do we have the first slide, please?

376
00:33:10,157 --> 00:33:13,560
What about the Pentagon?
The possibility of war

377
00:33:13,694 --> 00:33:16,196
in the Eighth Dimension, Mr Secretary?

378
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:17,331
What?

379
00:33:17,831 --> 00:33:22,169
It seemed like a strange connection
even back at the bus.

380
00:33:24,705 --> 00:33:26,673
Mr President?

381
00:33:28,508 --> 00:33:30,877
Some kind of interference.

382
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:34,714
Hello, Mr President?

383
00:33:34,848 --> 00:33:38,017
Mr President? Mr President, hello?

384
00:33:38,718 --> 00:33:40,286
Hello, Mr President?

385
00:33:40,853 --> 00:33:43,890
- What's going on?
- Maybe it's a prankster, some computer whiz kid.

386
00:33:44,023 --> 00:33:46,058
Not with Elephant Bravo.

387
00:33:46,192 --> 00:33:50,496
- Not with an alpha clearance.
- Alpha clearance? Hello? Mr...

388
00:33:50,596 --> 00:33:54,900
Ed, go back to the bus and reroute this call to
the president's suite at Walter Reed Hospital.

389
00:33:55,034 --> 00:33:59,872
Yeah, and make sure this is on the level.
We're busy people here.

390
00:34:00,005 --> 00:34:02,107
Does the President call him a lot?

391
00:34:06,845 --> 00:34:08,780
Pencil! Pen! Quick! Anything!

392
00:34:08,914 --> 00:34:10,649
Don't touch him!

393
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:15,253
What's he writing?

394
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:16,788
Conference room!

395
00:34:16,922 --> 00:34:18,924
Conference room! Let's go!

396
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,426
Launch thermopod.

397
00:34:33,371 --> 00:34:35,640
- There they are.
- Dr Banzai.

398
00:34:35,773 --> 00:34:38,342
- Don't you see 'em?
- What do you mean? Who?

399
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:42,880
Evil! Pure and simple from the
Eighth Dimension! Grab 'em!

400
00:34:43,381 --> 00:34:46,951
- Lectroids! Grab 'em!
- Lectroids? He's got a gun.

401
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:50,521
OK, wise guy!

402
00:34:53,323 --> 00:34:58,128
Let those gun belts hit the floor!
Nobody follows or the Prof is history!

403
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:03,300
- Where's Buckaroo?
- Get him.

404
00:35:03,433 --> 00:35:07,571
- Where's the overthruster?
- Get an ambulance.

405
00:35:23,419 --> 00:35:27,890
- Come on, will you just ignore them?
- Isn't that...?

406
00:35:51,647 --> 00:35:54,049
Hey, wait a minute! You can't ride that!

407
00:35:55,684 --> 00:35:57,752
It's Buckaroo Banzai!

408
00:36:10,531 --> 00:36:11,566
- Hold it!
- Freeze!

409
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:37,724
- I had my eyes open all day long, Burt.
- It may not be a total loss.

410
00:36:37,858 --> 00:36:42,229
- I'm about ready to go home.
- We might see something.

411
00:36:46,933 --> 00:36:50,036
I hit it! It is wounded.

412
00:36:51,838 --> 00:36:54,240
What'd it look like to you?

413
00:36:54,374 --> 00:36:57,544
- Like a big black flying dinosaur.
- Dinosaur? It was purple.

414
00:36:57,677 --> 00:37:02,482
- That's what it looked like. It was black.
- It was purple. It'll be dark before we even find it.

415
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:06,886
We get Professor Hikita
to cough up the crucial missing circuit

416
00:37:07,019 --> 00:37:09,288
and then we finally get our butts off this rock!

417
00:37:09,422 --> 00:37:12,291
Oh, yeah? Listen to this!

418
00:37:13,225 --> 00:37:16,729
Well, what is it? What is it?

419
00:37:16,862 --> 00:37:18,797
Black thermopod emergency beacon!

420
00:37:18,931 --> 00:37:21,600
Here? On Earth?

421
00:37:21,734 --> 00:37:25,737
- Why? John Bigbooté, why?
- Coordinates established.

422
00:37:25,871 --> 00:37:28,874
Electromagnetic energy
back on route three.

423
00:37:47,492 --> 00:37:50,595
- The whole top of the tree's squashed!
- Do you think it up there?

424
00:37:50,728 --> 00:37:52,630
Let's wait for the cops, Burt.

425
00:37:52,764 --> 00:37:55,666
What for? Are you scared?

426
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,970
- There's gotta be something there.
- Come on, Burt. There's nothing up there.

427
00:37:59,103 --> 00:38:02,540
Well, how do you know?
Here, hold this. Hold this!

428
00:38:04,909 --> 00:38:08,145
Where you going? Where you going?!

429
00:38:08,279 --> 00:38:10,314
Christmas shopping.

430
00:38:12,449 --> 00:38:15,986
- What's that?
- It's a stick. What's it look like?

431
00:38:17,488 --> 00:38:19,823
- Gimme some light, will ya?
- I got two guns in my hands.

432
00:38:19,957 --> 00:38:22,893
- Put one of them down.
- I ain't putting the guns down!

433
00:38:23,026 --> 00:38:26,363
- It's just a tree.
- Then leave it alone!

434
00:38:26,496 --> 00:38:30,033
Aagh! See, I told you!
I told you! Leave it alone!

435
00:38:33,136 --> 00:38:36,072
Run! Run! Run!

436
00:38:36,206 --> 00:38:41,411
- Shoot it, Bubba. Shoot it!
- I can't! It's jammed! It's jammed!

437
00:38:45,648 --> 00:38:49,252
There's something.
There's something coming out!

438
00:38:49,385 --> 00:38:51,287
- Where?
- Out of the top.

439
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:57,660
Oh, my soul!

440
00:38:59,461 --> 00:39:04,033
Throw me my gun, Bubba. Throw it.

441
00:39:06,735 --> 00:39:07,936
Sorry.

442
00:39:21,249 --> 00:39:22,283
Is he dead?

443
00:39:22,417 --> 00:39:25,420
Yeah, I think so. But look
at his face. It's changing.

444
00:39:25,553 --> 00:39:28,823
And his hair...
his hair is all disappeared.

445
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:34,028
- What's that smell? You smell electricity?
- He's crackling. We're standing in water.

446
00:39:34,162 --> 00:39:35,396
What is he, Burt?
Is he radioactive?

447
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:39,433
How the hell do I know?
Do I look like a nuclear genius?

448
00:39:39,567 --> 00:39:41,769
He's probably from Mars.
Or Jupiter.

449
00:39:41,902 --> 00:39:44,271
Jupiter? I hope he's alone.

450
00:39:44,405 --> 00:39:46,540
- There's somethin' over there.
- Where?

451
00:39:46,674 --> 00:39:48,709
Right there.

452
00:39:56,116 --> 00:39:58,151
What is it?

453
00:40:01,054 --> 00:40:05,125
Buckaroo Banzai. It's the latest issue.

454
00:40:08,228 --> 00:40:11,331
Rawhide, come in. Rawhide.

455
00:40:11,898 --> 00:40:13,166
Rawhide.

456
00:40:13,299 --> 00:40:17,570
Buckaroo, what's up? Where in Hades
are you? I'm gettin' a lot of static.

457
00:40:17,704 --> 00:40:21,140
Yeah. That's me.

458
00:40:21,274 --> 00:40:25,978
I've been ionised, but I'm OK now.

459
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:29,815
Listen, I'm switching
on the homing beacon.

460
00:40:29,949 --> 00:40:33,619
Mark two minute intervals... now.

461
00:40:33,753 --> 00:40:38,324
Look, we got the overthruster. But someone
shanghaied the professor right from the conference.

462
00:40:38,457 --> 00:40:43,195
- Oh, the deuce you say.
- What do you think?

463
00:40:43,328 --> 00:40:46,698
- Dr Lizardo, maybe?
- Yeah, I'd put money on it.

464
00:40:46,832 --> 00:40:49,501
- That crate.
- What crate?

465
00:40:49,635 --> 00:40:52,537
The crate they shoved in that van.

466
00:40:52,671 --> 00:40:54,206
You and the guys...

467
00:40:54,339 --> 00:40:58,109
go back to the house and dig up
everything you can on an outfit called

468
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:00,612
Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems.

469
00:41:00,745 --> 00:41:04,049
- You got that?
- Right. Yoyodyne. We're on it.

470
00:41:07,152 --> 00:41:10,555
Hand me that tarp, will ya?
Let's cover this guy up.

471
00:41:10,688 --> 00:41:13,725
- Guy? What guy?
- He's got paws.

472
00:41:16,194 --> 00:41:18,362
- Now what?
- Who are they?

473
00:41:20,364 --> 00:41:22,400
Cover it up.

474
00:41:29,373 --> 00:41:31,208
John Bigbooté, Officer.

475
00:41:31,342 --> 00:41:34,044
Head of Operations,
Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems.

476
00:41:34,178 --> 00:41:38,315
- There's one of our birds.
- That fella over there one of your birds, too?

477
00:41:38,415 --> 00:41:40,517
The droid, you mean?

478
00:41:41,385 --> 00:41:46,256
Doesn't look like anything I've seen
before. I mean, I've seen droids...

479
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:48,592
Nice night, huh?

480
00:42:02,438 --> 00:42:05,208
That big thing over there attacked me.

481
00:42:05,341 --> 00:42:08,244
Impossible. No, no, no, no, no, no.

482
00:42:08,377 --> 00:42:12,081
Yeah! It's some kinda creature.
There's part of it still stuck in the tree.

483
00:42:12,214 --> 00:42:16,418
No, it's a machine with 30-foot
leather wings. I think it's radioactive.

484
00:42:17,286 --> 00:42:21,090
Three minutes since he last moved.
This is a fix. Something is happening.

485
00:42:21,223 --> 00:42:23,092
Let's get somebody over there.

486
00:42:23,225 --> 00:42:26,495
Al, you set up the grid
and get the last known coordinates.

487
00:42:26,628 --> 00:42:29,598
Tommy, hop on the Marconi
and see if we got Blue Blazes

488
00:42:29,731 --> 00:42:32,801
in a ten-minute radius.
But no strike teams, Tommy, understand?

489
00:42:32,934 --> 00:42:35,637
I'm headed downstairs.
Keep everybody calm.

490
00:42:39,975 --> 00:42:43,111
- Hikita-san.
- Buckaroo!

491
00:42:44,212 --> 00:42:48,016
Repeating: Intrastate outward band five.

492
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:51,586
Coded. Calling all Blue Blaze
irregulars in the Garden State.

493
00:42:52,387 --> 00:42:56,491
Buckaroo... in trouble.
Will repeat coordinates.

494
00:42:56,624 --> 00:43:01,929
This is Scooter Lindley, Junior Blue Blaze
irregular 41 and a half. Hang on.

495
00:43:03,264 --> 00:43:06,767
- Dad! Dad! Buckaroo's in trouble!
- Say what?

496
00:43:06,901 --> 00:43:10,471
Aliens from the Eighth Dimension.
I'm seeing them now.

497
00:43:10,604 --> 00:43:12,439
You can see them now? Here?

498
00:43:12,573 --> 00:43:16,343
Yeah, the three jerks driving this van.
Look at this. What is this?

499
00:43:18,078 --> 00:43:19,947
It's your hand, Buckaroo.

500
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:23,617
No, no, no, no, it's a formula.
It's an antidote of some kind.

501
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:27,187
Whatever that was in that phoney call
from the president gave me information,

502
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:31,625
some electrochemical message that
allows me to see what they really are.

503
00:43:31,758 --> 00:43:36,062
- What are they?
- Lectroids from Planet Ten
by way of the Eighth Dimension.

504
00:43:36,629 --> 00:43:38,498
Mr Gomez?

505
00:43:38,631 --> 00:43:41,234
- I got a truck on the way to help mop things up.
- Identification?

506
00:43:41,367 --> 00:43:46,105
Or else this place'll become a zoo,
not to mention a haven for gawkers.

507
00:43:46,205 --> 00:43:48,474
Wait a minute. Now just a second.

508
00:43:48,608 --> 00:43:51,444
- Stay put. All of ya.
- Sure thing.

509
00:43:52,611 --> 00:43:54,980
We'll go ahead and start breaking it down.

510
00:43:55,114 --> 00:43:57,349
Don't touch it!

511
00:43:57,483 --> 00:44:00,886
I got my own help on the way.
Now, that's an order.

512
00:44:04,957 --> 00:44:07,092
Go find something to crack it open.

513
00:44:07,226 --> 00:44:08,961
There's a Harley in those bushes.

514
00:44:09,061 --> 00:44:12,698
I want you to get out and go to the laboratory,
start working on this formula.

515
00:44:12,831 --> 00:44:17,369
- I want you to synthesise it.
- Buckaroo! Give me the formula.

516
00:44:32,817 --> 00:44:33,551
Oh, wow!

517
00:44:35,553 --> 00:44:36,053
Peggy!

518
00:44:36,087 --> 00:44:40,224
She's not Peggy, Mrs Johnson.
Sois sage, mon amie.

519
00:44:40,358 --> 00:44:43,928
No. Of course not. How could she be?

520
00:44:44,061 --> 00:44:47,031
- Any word from Buckaroo?
- No, I thought he was with you guys.

521
00:44:47,164 --> 00:44:51,435
No, he's not. Ah, Dr Zwibel,
Penny Priddy... Mrs Johnson.

522
00:44:51,568 --> 00:44:55,439
Nice to meet you.
The fellas call me New Jersey.

523
00:45:00,944 --> 00:45:04,781
- Well, where are they all going?
- Bunk house. Off limits.

524
00:45:08,518 --> 00:45:10,620
Again, John Gomez!

525
00:45:14,257 --> 00:45:16,726
John O'Connor,
there's a crowbar in the truck.

526
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:18,895
I'll get it.

527
00:45:33,075 --> 00:45:36,278
Destroy yourself, John Gant.

528
00:45:37,112 --> 00:45:39,148
Set detonator.

529
00:45:43,285 --> 00:45:45,788
Detonator set.

530
00:45:46,755 --> 00:45:51,560
My most profuse apologies
to my homeland and loved ones.

531
00:45:51,727 --> 00:45:55,564
John Valuk is dead. He fell on his head.

532
00:45:56,765 --> 00:46:00,769
Perhaps John Parker will get through
with our message to Buckaroo Banzai.

533
00:46:00,902 --> 00:46:03,505
I said back off! Now, dammit, I mean it!

534
00:46:03,638 --> 00:46:06,808
Hey! Hey, leave him alone! Ugh!

535
00:46:07,775 --> 00:46:12,347
Easy, friend. Ha, Buckaroo Banzai!

536
00:46:15,316 --> 00:46:16,384
Hey!

537
00:46:17,018 --> 00:46:19,987
It's Buckaroo Banzai! Get him!

538
00:46:31,332 --> 00:46:32,333
Hustle up!

539
00:46:59,325 --> 00:47:04,330
Scooter Lindley, Blue Blaze Irregular.

540
00:47:16,709 --> 00:47:20,446
- It is! It is Professor Hikita.
- We're closing the gate. Please, step back!

541
00:47:20,579 --> 00:47:23,849
- Where's Buckaroo?

542
00:47:36,394 --> 00:47:40,165
We gotta have something for him.
Try a new cipher.

543
00:47:44,669 --> 00:47:47,138
- Try a G-cipher.
- G-cipher.

544
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,109
There...

545
00:47:51,342 --> 00:47:52,310
That's more like it.

546
00:47:52,944 --> 00:47:57,582
Looks like we've accessed their restricted
data file. Could be highly revealing.

547
00:47:57,715 --> 00:48:01,819
No sign of Buckaroo. The professor
just rode up saying something

548
00:48:01,952 --> 00:48:06,023
about space monsters and where's the
overthruster. Went straight to the lab.

549
00:48:06,190 --> 00:48:07,992
Space monsters, my ass.

550
00:48:11,128 --> 00:48:13,831
Hey, man, nice jacket.

551
00:48:21,171 --> 00:48:24,041
What's in the big pink box?

552
00:48:27,944 --> 00:48:31,514
Hey, buddy. May I help you?

553
00:48:31,648 --> 00:48:33,783
Hello! Buckaroo Banzai!?

554
00:48:33,917 --> 00:48:36,386
You a messenger? What you got here?

555
00:48:36,519 --> 00:48:40,590
No, no, wait a minute.
I need see Buckaroo Banzai in person.

556
00:48:40,990 --> 00:48:44,360
My name is John Parker.

557
00:48:44,494 --> 00:48:46,129
Identify yourself, no?

558
00:48:46,796 --> 00:48:49,599
Blue Blaze irregular Pinky Carruthers.

559
00:48:49,699 --> 00:48:54,170
Sorry, John, everybody
needs see Buckaroo. Later.

560
00:48:54,770 --> 00:48:57,106
Gino, run this down to the professor for me.

561
00:48:57,239 --> 00:48:58,841
Sounds like he's getting a little nervous.

562
00:49:00,909 --> 00:49:03,479
- This is queer. Look.
- What's up? What you got?

563
00:49:03,612 --> 00:49:08,650
All these people applied for social security cards
in the same town in New Jersey on exact same date.

564
00:49:08,784 --> 00:49:10,018
New Jersey?

565
00:49:10,752 --> 00:49:14,423
46 Yoyodyne employees,
Grover's Mill, New Jersey,

566
00:49:14,589 --> 00:49:16,958
11-1-38.

567
00:49:17,092 --> 00:49:18,693
I got some pictures, boys.

568
00:49:20,595 --> 00:49:24,632
It looks like a practical joke.
Check out these names:

569
00:49:24,766 --> 00:49:29,537
John Yaya? John Parrot?
John Bigbooty?

570
00:49:29,671 --> 00:49:33,307
Maybe not.
John Nolan? John O'Connor?

571
00:49:33,441 --> 00:49:35,576
No way, José.

572
00:49:35,710 --> 00:49:41,382
John Small Berries? It's a joke. Maybe
that's what Buckaroo was talking about.

573
00:49:41,515 --> 00:49:44,852
No, Reno, there are no ages
and no places of birth.

574
00:49:44,985 --> 00:49:49,423
Uh, Grover's Mill. Grover's Mill, 1938.
Why's that so familiar?

575
00:49:50,057 --> 00:49:54,428
They all have the same first name.
John, John, John, John, John.

576
00:49:54,561 --> 00:49:58,232
Somebody's playing games.
This is statistically impossible.

577
00:49:58,365 --> 00:50:00,500
No, no, no. Wait a minute,
wait a minute, um...

578
00:50:00,634 --> 00:50:02,602
November one. October.

579
00:50:02,903 --> 00:50:05,605
30 days have September, April,
June, November. Short February.

580
00:50:05,739 --> 00:50:09,276
And all the rest have 31. October 31st.

581
00:50:09,409 --> 00:50:11,711
Halloween.

582
00:50:11,845 --> 00:50:13,713
Oh, um...

583
00:50:13,847 --> 00:50:16,249
Don't you get it? Orson Welles.

584
00:50:16,382 --> 00:50:19,085
You mean the guy from
the old wine commercials?

585
00:50:19,219 --> 00:50:23,356
Halloween, 1938. War of the Worlds,
that fake radio news broadcast

586
00:50:23,489 --> 00:50:26,959
that got everybody scared,
thinking real, live Martians...

587
00:50:27,894 --> 00:50:30,763
were landing in Grover's Mill...

588
00:50:31,731 --> 00:50:34,200
New Jersey.

589
00:50:34,333 --> 00:50:36,735
Then it all just turned out to be a hoax.

590
00:50:36,869 --> 00:50:37,870
So?

591
00:50:38,704 --> 00:50:44,476
So... maybe it wasn't a hoax.
Or, I mean, maybe it isn't a hoax.

592
00:50:53,018 --> 00:50:56,254
If we don't find the overthruster,
Whorfin'll have us for supper.

593
00:50:56,388 --> 00:50:59,891
Who says the damn
thing's even here?

594
00:51:19,143 --> 00:51:21,178
Come on! Come on!

595
00:51:39,162 --> 00:51:41,965
- Who is he?
- I don't know.

596
00:52:07,723 --> 00:52:10,726
All right, who's the wise guy?

597
00:52:13,696 --> 00:52:16,265
I said, who's the wise guy?

598
00:52:29,411 --> 00:52:31,380
It's locked.

599
00:52:37,185 --> 00:52:39,654
John O'Connor, smash the window.

600
00:52:39,821 --> 00:52:42,757
Why me, John Bigbooté?

601
00:52:46,895 --> 00:52:49,297
It might be booby-trapped.

602
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:51,199
Oh.

603
00:52:57,738 --> 00:52:59,874
- Buckaroo!
- Mrs Johnson, this is Casper and Scooter Lindley.

604
00:53:00,007 --> 00:53:02,143
Is Hikita-san here yet? Where's
the overthruster? Where's Penny?

605
00:53:02,276 --> 00:53:06,680
Prof is in the lab with the overthruster. Penny's
in the right wing guest room. Everybody's safe and sound.

606
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:08,816
- They're lectroids, Buckaroo.
- From Planet Ten.

607
00:53:08,949 --> 00:53:12,252
- Planet Ten? How do you guys know?
- It's all on the yellow record. Come on.

608
00:53:12,386 --> 00:53:13,787
- Casper Lindley.
- Reno.

609
00:53:13,921 --> 00:53:18,058
- Yellow record?
- However, they didn't come here on a nonstop flight.

610
00:53:18,192 --> 00:53:21,928
They blasted through the Eighth
Dimension in 1938 over in Grover's Mill.

611
00:53:22,062 --> 00:53:25,165
Where there was a huge
electrical dimensional accident.

612
00:53:25,298 --> 00:53:29,269
Some giant explosion. And they hypnotised
Orson Welles into covering it up.

613
00:53:29,402 --> 00:53:32,605
So, first he says there's
an invasion from Mars,

614
00:53:32,739 --> 00:53:35,842
but then he says, no, no, no,
it's just a radio-show hoax.

615
00:53:35,975 --> 00:53:37,243
- Get it?
- No.

616
00:53:37,377 --> 00:53:40,647
- Let's go.
- Orson Welles? What about Yoyodyne? What about Dr Lizardo?

617
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:44,317
- That's what we're trying to tell you.
- There's someone living inside him.

618
00:53:45,451 --> 00:53:46,786
- Buckaroo.
- Pinky.

619
00:53:46,919 --> 00:53:52,992
Put this on. Here, y'all put these on.
There's more in the box and there's one over there.

620
00:53:53,125 --> 00:53:56,495
- What's this?
- It came with the record. It's like a 3-D type thing.

621
00:53:56,629 --> 00:53:59,031
How am I supposed to know
he's from outer space?

622
00:53:59,164 --> 00:54:02,801
This Rasta guy pedals up to the front gate
and delivers it all in a pink cake box.

623
00:54:02,935 --> 00:54:05,337
- What? What for?
- We don't know. It wouldn't tell us.

624
00:54:05,471 --> 00:54:09,308
- It wants to talk to the head honcho.
- Lights.

625
00:54:21,853 --> 00:54:24,155
Salutations, great Buckaroo Banzai.

626
00:54:25,423 --> 00:54:29,661
I am John Emdall from Planet Ten.

627
00:54:29,794 --> 00:54:33,898
A common, grave danger
confronts both our worlds.

628
00:54:34,499 --> 00:54:37,401
- After a bloody reign of terror...
- Hey, what is that?

629
00:54:37,535 --> 00:54:40,838
...the hated leader of a military caste...

630
00:54:40,972 --> 00:54:44,809
the self-proclaimed "Lord" John Whorfin,

631
00:54:44,909 --> 00:54:47,845
a bloodthirsty butcher
as evil as your Hitler...

632
00:54:47,978 --> 00:54:48,979
Oh, wow!

633
00:54:49,113 --> 00:54:52,716
...was overthrown
by freedom-loving forces...

634
00:54:52,850 --> 00:54:57,521
tried and condemned, along with
several hundred of his followers,

635
00:54:57,654 --> 00:55:03,193
to spend eternity in the formless void
of the Eighth Dimension.

636
00:55:03,326 --> 00:55:06,062
Did you tell Penny that
Buckaroo's looking for her?

637
00:55:06,196 --> 00:55:07,464
I looked in her room.
She wasn't there.

638
00:55:07,597 --> 00:55:09,232
- Who's Penny?
- Where is she?

639
00:55:09,366 --> 00:55:12,602
Will everybody shut up
so I can hear the rest of this thing?

640
00:55:12,736 --> 00:55:18,441
And now you, Buckaroo Banzai, have
unintentionally helped John Whorfin

641
00:55:18,942 --> 00:55:22,045
with the success of your
oscillation overthruster.

642
00:55:22,178 --> 00:55:28,384
For our intelligence warns us that
he intends to steal your overthruster.

643
00:55:28,517 --> 00:55:33,556
If he should attempt this,
we will have no choice

644
00:55:33,689 --> 00:55:37,459
but to disrupt worldwide
electronic communications

645
00:55:37,593 --> 00:55:42,164
and fire a particle-beam weapon
from your airspace

646
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:46,869
to Smolensk in the Union
of Soviet Socialist Republics.

647
00:55:46,969 --> 00:55:50,572
That an action that the Kremlin will most certainly
misinterpret as an American first strike.

648
00:55:50,706 --> 00:55:57,812
- They're already a little trigger-happy.
- Stop John Whorfin before sunset.

649
00:55:57,946 --> 00:56:02,951
If you fail, we will be forced
to help you destroy yourselves.

650
00:56:03,084 --> 00:56:05,987
- If it ain't one thing, it's another.
- Lighten up.

651
00:56:06,121 --> 00:56:08,923
End of discussion.

652
00:56:10,158 --> 00:56:12,860
Discussion? What discussion?

653
00:56:15,763 --> 00:56:20,101
She gotta be kidding, right?
Vaporise the whole damn planet?

654
00:56:20,234 --> 00:56:25,639
- You wanna roll those dice, Casper?
- No, no, no, not me, man. No way.

655
00:56:25,773 --> 00:56:29,276
Gents... we're going to Yoyodyne.

656
00:56:29,410 --> 00:56:32,012
Rawhide, see how Hikita-san is
with that formula.

657
00:56:32,146 --> 00:56:34,715
Billy, tell Sam to prep
the jet car for city driving.

658
00:56:34,848 --> 00:56:37,151
What about a Blue Blaze strike team?

659
00:56:37,284 --> 00:56:41,054
We keep it intimate. Call the Kolodny
Brothers. Call the Rug Suckers.

660
00:56:41,188 --> 00:56:44,291
- Where are you going?
- Get my guns.

661
00:56:45,859 --> 00:56:47,694
His guns?

662
00:56:48,094 --> 00:56:51,498
Okay, okay, I'm a girl. I don't deny it.
I sneaked into your bedroom.

663
00:56:51,631 --> 00:56:54,534
I invaded your privacy.
I went through your personal belongings.

664
00:56:54,667 --> 00:56:59,038
- Mrs Johnson! I can never find anything around here...
- I took a bath!

665
00:56:59,172 --> 00:57:03,209
- Penny, what's your problem?
- Me! You! That picture!

666
00:57:03,342 --> 00:57:07,914
I'm going crazy. Who's that girl, Buckaroo?
What's going on around here?

667
00:57:08,047 --> 00:57:10,383
You drag me out of jail.
You're like Jerry Lewis.

668
00:57:10,516 --> 00:57:13,352
You give me hope to carry on, but then
you leave me in the lurch

669
00:57:13,486 --> 00:57:17,556
while you strap on your six-guns.
What do you want from me?

670
00:57:17,690 --> 00:57:20,025
- Who am I?
- As near as I can figure...

671
00:57:20,526 --> 00:57:24,096
you had an identical twin sister and...

672
00:57:24,229 --> 00:57:26,265
I married her.

673
00:57:27,299 --> 00:57:29,101
But that's over now.

674
00:57:29,234 --> 00:57:34,372
And she's gone and that's about all
there is, really, to say about that.

675
00:57:45,316 --> 00:57:50,855
We don't know what to expect here.
It disagrees with all the standard pictures.

676
00:57:51,723 --> 00:57:55,059
It's producing a magnetic force.

677
00:57:55,193 --> 00:57:57,595
No, no. I'm wrong!

678
00:58:09,006 --> 00:58:10,941
Hey!

679
00:58:14,511 --> 00:58:16,747
Oh, tell me I'm dreaming.

680
00:58:17,714 --> 00:58:19,850
- Ow!
- Oh, sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That's...

681
00:58:20,017 --> 00:58:23,453
- Buckaroo! Sorry. Sam's dead.
- Sam?

682
00:58:23,587 --> 00:58:25,922
Someone broke into the jet-car.
Things are going haywire over at the lab.

683
00:58:26,056 --> 00:58:28,091
Wait here. I'll be right back.

684
00:58:39,469 --> 00:58:40,503
Oh, boy.

685
00:58:48,578 --> 00:58:54,250
He's dead. Spread out.
They can't be very far off.

686
00:58:55,985 --> 00:58:59,755
Okay. Tommy, check the biomedical labs.
Reno, take physics. Jersey, go with Reno.

687
00:58:59,888 --> 00:59:02,091
- Where you going?
- Engineering.

688
00:59:03,525 --> 00:59:06,195
Cowboy! Hold your gun
in front of you, man.

689
00:59:06,328 --> 00:59:08,964
- Oh, I see. I got that. OK.
- It's cool.

690
00:59:21,443 --> 00:59:23,044
Buckaroo, behind you!

691
00:59:32,687 --> 00:59:36,290
- You... you OK?
- Yeah. Just let me catch my breath.

692
00:59:36,390 --> 00:59:40,227
Professor went down into the purification
vent. He's got the overthruster.

693
00:59:40,361 --> 00:59:42,396
All right.

694
00:59:52,539 --> 00:59:55,075
Why is there a watermelon there?

695
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:58,612
I'll tell you later.

696
01:00:31,043 --> 01:00:32,878
Buckaroo?

697
01:00:36,749 --> 01:00:38,484
Rawhide?

698
01:00:39,685 --> 01:00:41,286
Anybody?

699
01:01:07,979 --> 01:01:11,816
Here, young lady. The overthruster.

700
01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:18,489
Here, put this in your purse.

701
01:01:20,291 --> 01:01:22,326
Get out of here!

702
01:01:24,995 --> 01:01:27,164
Where's your overthruster?

703
01:01:27,298 --> 01:01:29,333
Hikita-san!

704
01:01:34,738 --> 01:01:37,207
Nice morning, huh?

705
01:01:51,154 --> 01:01:53,790
It's just making my legs asleep.

706
01:01:53,923 --> 01:01:57,660
- What the hell is wrong with him?
- I don't know. I don't know. Are you cold?

707
01:01:58,294 --> 01:01:59,729
It's my spine.

708
01:02:06,802 --> 01:02:11,040
- What're you still doing on this floor?
- I think it's cos I can't move my legs.

709
01:02:11,641 --> 01:02:13,909
Ooh, damn!

710
01:02:15,778 --> 01:02:18,414
- What is it? Apache?
- Arachtoid.

711
01:02:18,547 --> 01:02:21,350
Oh, spiders. So I was right, huh?

712
01:02:21,483 --> 01:02:24,887
We got the guy, Rawhide.
Sucker only tried...

713
01:02:25,654 --> 01:02:28,824
- Any antidote for these things?
- No. Not at all.

714
01:02:30,225 --> 01:02:33,895
- Come over here.
- Does that mean you're on our side?

715
01:02:34,029 --> 01:02:35,664
That's right.

716
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:43,605
Man! Those things
pack a mean wallop, huh?

717
01:02:44,239 --> 01:02:46,708
What are y'all looking at?

718
01:02:47,709 --> 01:02:51,612
You're on the clock. Let's saddle up, huh?

719
01:02:59,487 --> 01:03:02,023
Hey, man, they're stealing my helicopter!

720
01:03:05,759 --> 01:03:07,828
They've got Penny!

721
01:03:07,962 --> 01:03:10,864
She has the overthruster.

722
01:03:10,965 --> 01:03:14,001
We'll get it back. We'll get it back.

723
01:03:14,568 --> 01:03:21,074
It's... it's not Buckaroo Banzai per se,
Mr President. It's his men.

724
01:03:21,208 --> 01:03:24,811
Foreigners, some of 'em.
Or their names have been changed.

725
01:03:24,945 --> 01:03:28,748
Their true backgrounds
are shrouded in secrecy!

726
01:03:28,882 --> 01:03:34,220
Now, all I'm saying is that this jet car
belongs in the hands of Defense.

727
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:38,725
I mean, if the Banzai Institute
doesn't want to sell it to us,

728
01:03:38,825 --> 01:03:41,127
then we're gonna have
to take it from them!

729
01:03:41,260 --> 01:03:44,363
In national interest, of course.

730
01:03:46,232 --> 01:03:47,833
Come in.

731
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:53,139
Excuse me, Mr President, World Watch One.
Direct-incoming transmission.

732
01:03:53,272 --> 01:03:54,673
Yeah.

733
01:04:00,679 --> 01:04:03,148
Hello, Mr President, I know your back is killing you,

734
01:04:03,282 --> 01:04:07,352
but I have a developing situation here
and I must speak frankly.

735
01:04:07,486 --> 01:04:11,089
Buckaroo...
Secretary of Defense McKinley

736
01:04:11,189 --> 01:04:14,826
and my National Security Advisor
Smirnoff, are visiting me,

737
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:17,362
but I have no secrets from them.

738
01:04:17,495 --> 01:04:20,966
Well, something has reared
its ugly head in outer space, Mr President,

739
01:04:21,099 --> 01:04:23,768
and it looks like the Earth is caught in a crossfire.

740
01:04:23,868 --> 01:04:26,804
We have reason to believe
that there are vicious red aliens

741
01:04:26,938 --> 01:04:30,475
walking freely among us,
posing as the owners and operators

742
01:04:30,608 --> 01:04:32,643
of Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems.

743
01:04:32,777 --> 01:04:38,516
Yoyodyne Propulsion... the people
working on our Truncheon Bomber?

744
01:04:38,649 --> 01:04:43,220
- In the hands of foreign nationals?
- Excuse me, Mr President. Time is short.

745
01:04:44,188 --> 01:04:47,124
In order to prevent
John Whorfin's escape,

746
01:04:47,224 --> 01:04:50,995
my comrades are at this very moment
taking up a geostationary position

747
01:04:51,128 --> 01:04:54,364
over New Jersey.
This situation is explosive.

748
01:04:54,498 --> 01:04:56,967
- Who the hell is that?
- Explosive, what are you saying man?

749
01:04:57,067 --> 01:04:58,969
Some kind of race war in New Jersey?

750
01:04:59,069 --> 01:05:00,470
No, Mr President, no.

751
01:05:00,570 --> 01:05:04,441
This man as you call him is not
a human being at all, but is, in fact,

752
01:05:04,574 --> 01:05:08,712
a black lectroid named John Parker
from the very same Planet Ten.

753
01:05:08,845 --> 01:05:12,615
And his spaceship is, at this moment,
anchored above Yoyodyne.

754
01:05:12,749 --> 01:05:13,717
Yoyodyne.

755
01:05:13,850 --> 01:05:16,786
- Buckaroo, my good friend...
- That's it!

756
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:20,757
These red creatures, they must
somehow give off the bacteria.

757
01:05:20,890 --> 01:05:25,895
We breathe it. It swims up our nose
into our cerebral cortex

758
01:05:26,028 --> 01:05:29,465
where it talks to our brain cells.

759
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:32,635
Tells us to see exactly
what they want us to see.

760
01:05:32,768 --> 01:05:34,236
Electric brainwashing.

761
01:05:34,370 --> 01:05:36,005
Diabolical. They got us so confused...

762
01:05:36,105 --> 01:05:39,208
Buckaroo, I don't know what to say.

763
01:05:40,542 --> 01:05:43,746
Lectroids from Planet Ten?

764
01:05:43,879 --> 01:05:46,815
Nuclear extortion?

765
01:05:46,949 --> 01:05:49,251
A girl named John?

766
01:05:49,384 --> 01:05:51,119
Buckaroo, Lectroid Wing Commander.

767
01:05:51,253 --> 01:05:54,990
Excuse me, Mr President,
I have to go talk to the hornet's nest.

768
01:05:56,291 --> 01:05:58,260
Good God.

769
01:05:58,393 --> 01:06:02,931
Well, if it wasn't Buckaroo Banzai,
I'd say commit the man.

770
01:06:03,064 --> 01:06:04,666
Get me SAC Headquarters, Omaha,

771
01:06:04,799 --> 01:06:08,736
NORAD and the Strategic Space Command.
I want some hard data on that cloud.

772
01:06:08,870 --> 01:06:12,106
John, get out in the field.
Stick your beak into this one.

773
01:06:13,574 --> 01:06:17,278
- What is this thing made of?
- Cobalt and electricity.

774
01:06:17,411 --> 01:06:21,949
They're armed for bear, Buckaroo.

775
01:06:22,083 --> 01:06:24,218
World Watch One.

776
01:06:26,921 --> 01:06:28,889
Buckaroo.

777
01:06:29,056 --> 01:06:31,091
It's Whorfin.

778
01:06:34,161 --> 01:06:35,662
Dr Banzai?

779
01:06:37,798 --> 01:06:40,968
Yes, this is Emilio Lizardo.

780
01:06:41,101 --> 01:06:43,370
Maybe you don't remember me.

781
01:06:44,337 --> 01:06:48,174
Ah. I'm flattered.
We know the same people.

782
01:06:49,309 --> 01:06:52,012
Yeah. In fact, one of them
is with me right now.

783
01:06:52,145 --> 01:06:54,180
Your associate...

784
01:06:54,314 --> 01:06:56,783
Dr Penny Priddy.

785
01:06:56,883 --> 01:06:58,218
Doctor?

786
01:06:58,351 --> 01:07:00,987
May I pass along my congratulations

787
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:04,957
for your great
interdimensional breakthrough.

788
01:07:05,057 --> 01:07:10,162
I'm sure in the miserable annals of
the Earth, you will be duly enshrined.

789
01:07:12,031 --> 01:07:16,001
However... Miss Priddy claims

790
01:07:16,135 --> 01:07:18,971
to be unable to solve my problem

791
01:07:19,071 --> 01:07:22,274
and provide me with
the crucial missing circuit

792
01:07:22,441 --> 01:07:24,042
for my overthruster!

793
01:07:24,676 --> 01:07:26,712
He hasn't found it. He hasn't found it.

794
01:07:26,845 --> 01:07:29,381
Maybe you can convince her to try.

795
01:07:30,382 --> 01:07:32,417
John O'Connor!

796
01:07:33,351 --> 01:07:35,020
I'm not worth it, Buckaroo! Forget about me!

797
01:07:35,153 --> 01:07:38,823
- They'll never break me. Never!
- Penny, get off the phone.

798
01:07:38,957 --> 01:07:42,861
Dr Lizardo, really what does she know
about an overthruster? She's not a scientist.

799
01:07:42,994 --> 01:07:46,698
Shall we play...
a Penny for your thoughts?

800
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:52,270
Maybe you can come in her place, huh?

801
01:07:52,403 --> 01:07:55,506
Yoyodyne, Banzai. You know the address.

802
01:07:55,606 --> 01:07:59,277
Come alone and bring your overthruster!

803
01:08:01,445 --> 01:08:05,883
He'll come. I know his type.

804
01:08:06,016 --> 01:08:08,419
Take her to the pit!

805
01:08:08,552 --> 01:08:10,587
Go, Bigbooty!

806
01:08:13,123 --> 01:08:16,994
Use more honey!
Find out what she knows.

807
01:08:17,394 --> 01:08:20,931
These breathing devices Hikita-san has cooked up
will enable you to see them

808
01:08:21,064 --> 01:08:26,403
as they really are, as I've been seeing
them since yesterday - as Lectroids.

809
01:08:26,536 --> 01:08:29,406
In our eyes, they're not very pretty.

810
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:32,509
Nothing personal, John Parker.

811
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:40,316
If we blow this today...
there ain't no tomorrow.

812
01:08:40,450 --> 01:08:44,120
We have only 240 minutes remaining.

813
01:08:44,253 --> 01:08:47,623
Right. I'm working under the assumption
that Penny still has the overthruster,

814
01:08:47,757 --> 01:08:51,527
but this psycho Whorfin doesn't
know that. So that'll be my job.

815
01:08:51,661 --> 01:08:53,996
To get her and it back in one piece.

816
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:59,435
Your objective is to 86 Whorfin.
You know your two strike groups.

817
01:08:59,568 --> 01:09:01,170
Apache group, that's you, Reno.

818
01:09:01,303 --> 01:09:05,874
Chaparral group, that's you, Perfect
Tommy. Parker'll ride with Chaparral.

819
01:09:06,008 --> 01:09:11,113
It's my guess that no human being
has ever been inside the place.

820
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:16,618
So who knows what we're gonna find
there. Top priority is the overthruster.

821
01:09:16,751 --> 01:09:20,188
Without it, Whorfin
can't get off this planet.

822
01:09:20,322 --> 01:09:24,025
This homing device will probably
make it very easy to find.

823
01:09:24,159 --> 01:09:26,661
And maybe a lot harder to get back.

824
01:09:27,529 --> 01:09:29,464
Strategic Space Command now reports

825
01:09:29,597 --> 01:09:33,434
all the surveillance satellite
communication jammed.

826
01:09:33,601 --> 01:09:36,037
Jammed? By who? Who by?

827
01:09:36,170 --> 01:09:38,940
Possible atmospheric conditions, sir.

828
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:41,142
- Solar.
- Solar?

829
01:09:41,275 --> 01:09:45,679
Intelligence confirms that Soviets
are having the same problem.

830
01:09:45,813 --> 01:09:48,515
Should we be on Code Red?

831
01:09:48,649 --> 01:09:51,352
We go to Code Red,
the Russians go to Code Red.

832
01:09:51,485 --> 01:09:53,887
No sense going off half-cocked, Mr President.

833
01:09:54,021 --> 01:09:56,423
I don't know, but Buckaroo Banzai
has never been wrong before.

834
01:09:56,557 --> 01:09:59,793
The man's been through solid matter,
for crying out loud.

835
01:09:59,993 --> 01:10:01,795
Who knows what happened to his brain.

836
01:10:01,962 --> 01:10:04,064
Maybe it scrambled his molecules.

837
01:10:04,197 --> 01:10:07,567
All I'm saying is,
Mr President, let's not panic.

838
01:10:09,202 --> 01:10:11,037
What's happening?

839
01:10:13,206 --> 01:10:16,409
Electromagnetic pulsar.

840
01:10:19,712 --> 01:10:23,249
Russians just gone to
Defense Condition Two, sir.

841
01:10:23,383 --> 01:10:24,851
We've no choice, then.

842
01:10:25,418 --> 01:10:28,688
Mr President, I am a soldier,
and I'm a damn good one.

843
01:10:28,821 --> 01:10:31,757
I've got enough decorations
to snap a Christmas tree.

844
01:10:31,891 --> 01:10:36,929
All I'm trying to say is - and I hope
I speak for everyone in this room -

845
01:10:37,062 --> 01:10:40,232
is that I am scared.

846
01:10:40,366 --> 01:10:42,968
I'm barely holding my fudge right now.

847
01:10:43,102 --> 01:10:47,673
Stop acting like a goddamn schoolgirl,
General, and pull yourself together.

848
01:10:47,839 --> 01:10:51,943
I'm glad someone has
the balls to face facts.

849
01:10:58,550 --> 01:11:01,019
- Don't embarrass us.
- Have I ever?

850
01:11:01,186 --> 01:11:04,422
Give me 30 minutes,
then come in and mop up.

851
01:11:18,603 --> 01:11:20,638
Shut up!

852
01:11:31,782 --> 01:11:34,585
I've had enough of you, Penny Priddy!

853
01:11:40,157 --> 01:11:44,895
Well... Mrs Johnson, thank you.

854
01:11:45,028 --> 01:11:49,466
It's certainly food for thought.

855
01:11:49,599 --> 01:11:53,903
No answer at the Kremlin, sir.
Just dead silence.

856
01:11:54,504 --> 01:11:57,207
Then I guess the moment is upon us.

857
01:11:57,340 --> 01:11:59,309
Here you go, Mr President.

858
01:11:59,409 --> 01:12:02,311
The Presidential Emergency Action Document.

859
01:12:02,412 --> 01:12:04,313
For your eyes only.

860
01:12:04,447 --> 01:12:06,482
John Hancock these, and Hail Mary.

861
01:12:06,616 --> 01:12:09,652
You know, on second thought, maybe
we should think this through a bit more

862
01:12:09,785 --> 01:12:13,389
so that future generations
of Americans will...

863
01:12:14,290 --> 01:12:15,491
Oh, wow.

864
01:12:17,493 --> 01:12:21,397
"Declaration of War: The Short Form."

865
01:12:36,044 --> 01:12:39,881
Bring that thing right through the gate.
Straight ahead, straight ahead, come on.

866
01:12:43,518 --> 01:12:47,088
Blacks... are on this planet!

867
01:12:47,989 --> 01:12:51,025
Here, in New Jersey!

868
01:12:51,159 --> 01:12:54,595
Coming to destroy us!

869
01:12:54,729 --> 01:12:56,364
We must act!

870
01:12:56,497 --> 01:12:59,533
Escape or die!

871
01:13:00,501 --> 01:13:02,737
We must work faster

872
01:13:02,870 --> 01:13:06,640
to finish the great vehicle itself,

873
01:13:06,774 --> 01:13:11,378
so we can enter the Eighth Dimension

874
01:13:11,512 --> 01:13:15,616
and free our trapped comrades!

875
01:13:15,749 --> 01:13:18,719
So we can return home

876
01:13:18,852 --> 01:13:22,522
and seize power once again!

877
01:13:24,691 --> 01:13:29,162
- What is the greatest joy?
- The joy of duty!

878
01:13:29,296 --> 01:13:34,067
- Louder!
- The joy of duty!

879
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:37,604
History is made at night.

880
01:13:37,737 --> 01:13:42,842
Character is what you are in the dark!

881
01:13:42,975 --> 01:13:46,279
We must work while the clock,
she's ticking.

882
01:13:47,980 --> 01:13:52,585
- We hide, they seek!
- Death to the Black Lectroids!

883
01:13:52,718 --> 01:13:55,754
- Where are we going?
- Planet Ten!

884
01:13:55,888 --> 01:13:58,157
- When?
- Real soon!

885
01:14:05,497 --> 01:14:09,034
Come on over here. Bring it this way!

886
01:14:12,004 --> 01:14:14,573
This way!

887
01:14:14,739 --> 01:14:16,541
Now park it.

888
01:14:18,076 --> 01:14:20,312
There's no overthruster!

889
01:14:23,648 --> 01:14:27,051
Get him here! Get him outta there!
I wanna see his face!

890
01:14:28,853 --> 01:14:31,055
It's not here!

891
01:14:31,189 --> 01:14:34,292
Take him to the shock tower.

892
01:14:50,140 --> 01:14:53,710
The equations. Solve them.

893
01:14:53,844 --> 01:14:58,849
Enter your data on this keypad.
And you better be right.

894
01:14:58,982 --> 01:15:02,986
The shock tower is a lie detector.

895
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:06,523
Any falsehood triggers a brutal charge

896
01:15:06,656 --> 01:15:09,926
to your auditory meatus.

897
01:15:12,162 --> 01:15:14,697
- Open circuit.
- So?

898
01:15:14,831 --> 01:15:19,035
You're not getting jack from me until
you let Penny out of this junkyard.

899
01:15:19,168 --> 01:15:22,872
Curse you, Banzai!
Don't you realise what are you saying?

900
01:15:23,005 --> 01:15:26,542
Your whole planet is gonna be destroyed
and you sit here wasting time?

901
01:15:26,676 --> 01:15:29,211
Time? I got nothing but time.

902
01:15:32,915 --> 01:15:37,386
Sealed with a curse as sharp as a knife.

903
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:41,390
Doomed is your soul
and damned is your life.

904
01:15:42,591 --> 01:15:44,293
Buzz off.

905
01:15:47,095 --> 01:15:49,131
Bigbooty...

906
01:15:49,264 --> 01:15:51,733
more power to him.

907
01:15:51,867 --> 01:15:54,402
Bigbooté.

908
01:15:54,536 --> 01:15:57,472
I want my missing circuit, now!

909
01:16:31,138 --> 01:16:35,142
- Is there something I can help you with?
- Is Buckaroo upstairs?

910
01:16:35,275 --> 01:16:38,011
Hello, Mr Secretary.

911
01:16:38,145 --> 01:16:39,212
Where is he?

912
01:16:41,248 --> 01:16:44,718
- That won't work either.
- Porco Giuda!

913
01:16:46,753 --> 01:16:48,555
Hey, Banzai.

914
01:16:51,324 --> 01:16:53,960
Take a look at your girlfriend.

915
01:16:57,931 --> 01:17:01,000
Devo lavorare con persone idiota!

916
01:17:05,271 --> 01:17:10,242
She'll live... but only for a while.

917
01:17:10,376 --> 01:17:13,679
And she won't enjoy it.

918
01:17:13,813 --> 01:17:16,549
Only you can save her from a fate

919
01:17:16,682 --> 01:17:19,918
even worse than that of
your friend, Mr Rawhide.

920
01:17:20,052 --> 01:17:23,756
Missing circuit's in your head, Whorfin.

921
01:17:23,889 --> 01:17:26,158
Bigbooty...

922
01:17:26,291 --> 01:17:28,727
activate your probes.

923
01:17:46,845 --> 01:17:50,515
Slow this sucker down.
I'll handle these birds.

924
01:17:55,920 --> 01:18:00,925
You gentlemen have a telephone? You wanna jump
on the horn and get Mr John Bigboot.

925
01:18:01,058 --> 01:18:02,393
It's Bigbooté.

926
01:18:02,526 --> 01:18:06,764
Oh, hell, if you wanna do anything
nowadays, you gotta do it yourself.

927
01:18:06,897 --> 01:18:09,967
- What is your name?
- John Yaya.

928
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:13,470
John Yaya, huh? And you are?

929
01:18:13,604 --> 01:18:15,639
"John Small Berries."

930
01:18:36,626 --> 01:18:39,629
- He's down there. I feel it.
- We're not...

931
01:18:48,971 --> 01:18:54,643
- It's a nest.
- Birds nest. People don't nest.

932
01:18:54,777 --> 01:18:56,278
Red Lectroid.

933
01:19:20,001 --> 01:19:22,337
Don't touch it. It might be a bomb.

934
01:19:22,470 --> 01:19:23,705
Nah, it's a toy.

935
01:19:28,676 --> 01:19:32,346
- Sit down!
- Sir? Hey, that area's restricted.

936
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:35,883
Yeah? Not to me!

937
01:19:40,621 --> 01:19:45,826
This I know. This I know.
And I love Whorfin too.

938
01:19:50,230 --> 01:19:53,100
- What is this place?
- It's a bivouac. They sleep here.

939
01:19:53,233 --> 01:19:56,904
- Can they all shoot stingers?
- You better believe it.

940
01:19:57,037 --> 01:19:59,206
- Lizardo. Which way?
- Over there.

941
01:19:59,339 --> 01:20:01,875
- You sure?
- Believe it.

942
01:20:02,009 --> 01:20:04,044
Just once.

943
01:20:38,744 --> 01:20:40,779
- Where...?
- Shh.

944
01:20:43,215 --> 01:20:45,584
What's going on? Where are we?

945
01:20:45,717 --> 01:20:48,453
It's a bivouac, man. They sleep here.

946
01:21:05,036 --> 01:21:07,138
What's happening?

947
01:21:07,272 --> 01:21:09,907
John Isaac, get the boy! Andiamo!

948
01:21:10,041 --> 01:21:13,678
Bigbooty! Go down to the pit. Kill the girl!

949
01:21:16,948 --> 01:21:18,783
Scooter! Where are you?

950
01:21:29,260 --> 01:21:32,129
Hey, somebody turn off
that gosh dang klaxon!

951
01:21:32,262 --> 01:21:37,301
Work. Work. Work.

952
01:21:40,304 --> 01:21:42,506
There are monkey boys in the facility.

953
01:21:43,507 --> 01:21:44,708
You are secure.

954
01:21:45,775 --> 01:21:46,810
Do not panic.

955
01:21:50,246 --> 01:21:52,482
John Emdall must die.

956
01:21:53,616 --> 01:21:56,119
Lord Whorfin must live.

957
01:21:57,987 --> 01:21:58,888
Work.

958
01:21:59,155 --> 01:22:00,523
Work.

959
01:22:00,790 --> 01:22:02,291
Work.

960
01:22:31,319 --> 01:22:32,721
Sorry. I'm sorry.

961
01:22:32,854 --> 01:22:34,356
- Sidney.
- Buckaroo!

962
01:22:34,489 --> 01:22:37,592
It's good to see you, pal. You got a pistol?

963
01:22:37,726 --> 01:22:39,628
Yeah.

964
01:22:42,130 --> 01:22:44,365
What are you gonna use?

965
01:22:45,467 --> 01:22:48,002
- Where are we?
- I hate to tell you.

966
01:22:49,037 --> 01:22:51,406
Where are we going?

967
01:22:53,408 --> 01:22:55,443
This way.

968
01:23:04,218 --> 01:23:05,786
Get over here.

969
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:09,923
Keep your noses to the grindstone.

970
01:23:10,057 --> 01:23:12,626
The greatest joy is the joy of duty.

971
01:23:13,861 --> 01:23:16,930
Work. Work. Work.

972
01:23:17,664 --> 01:23:21,101
Monkey boys are feeble.
Lord Whorfin is supreme!

973
01:23:21,234 --> 01:23:27,007
Bigboot! Bigboot! Hold on a minute,
I wanna talk to you.

974
01:23:27,874 --> 01:23:32,512
What the hell's the matter with you?
You deaf? I said I wanna talk to you!

975
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,136
Jesus!

976
01:23:57,503 --> 01:24:01,507
What the hell is going on here,
Bigboot? Where's my bomber?

977
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:06,778
Bigbooté. John O'Connor,
put the slug on the track.

978
01:24:06,912 --> 01:24:09,848
I don't give a flying handshake
what your name is!

979
01:24:09,982 --> 01:24:13,318
I'm here to see a bomber!
This sure ain't it.

980
01:24:13,452 --> 01:24:16,988
Let's just go back upstairs to my office.

981
01:24:17,122 --> 01:24:19,491
Talk about this like
two reasonable beings.

982
01:24:19,624 --> 01:24:23,027
You listen to me. Your private life,
that's your own concern.

983
01:24:23,161 --> 01:24:27,532
But I'm here to see a bomber
and I'm damn sure gonna see it now!

984
01:24:27,665 --> 01:24:31,803
Look at this place. Don't you have
any pride? It looks like a damn pigsty!

985
01:24:33,304 --> 01:24:38,175
It's not my goddamn planet.
Understand, monkey boy?

986
01:24:39,143 --> 01:24:42,747
- Let's get outta here, O'Connor.
- But Whorfin said we could kill her.

987
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:05,836
(lectroid #5 growls)

988
01:25:13,209 --> 01:25:15,211
You owe me one, Buck.

989
01:25:22,885 --> 01:25:25,721
It's not over yet.

990
01:25:26,689 --> 01:25:29,792
I may be down but I'm not out.

991
01:25:35,898 --> 01:25:38,867
What is that? Don't pick it up. No.

992
01:25:42,371 --> 01:25:44,006
Penny.

993
01:25:45,174 --> 01:25:47,075
How's she doing?

994
01:25:47,209 --> 01:25:50,212
- I don't know.
- There's no overthruster.

995
01:25:50,345 --> 01:25:51,980
- Buckaroo Banzai!
- What?

996
01:25:52,114 --> 01:25:54,583
There is little time!

997
01:25:54,716 --> 01:25:58,653
You better come quickly
if your planet is still important to you.

998
01:25:58,787 --> 01:26:02,257
Leave her to me.
You take care of business.

999
01:26:03,124 --> 01:26:04,793
Thanks.

1000
01:26:04,926 --> 01:26:06,995
- Go. Go.
- Right.

1001
01:26:09,964 --> 01:26:13,468
- Where's Buckaroo Banzai?
- He's flown the coop.

1002
01:26:13,601 --> 01:26:15,336
- Is the girl dead?
- Yes!

1003
01:26:15,470 --> 01:26:18,339
Then sound the call to board the ship.

1004
01:26:18,472 --> 01:26:21,142
Without the crucial missing circuit,
we'll never make it!

1005
01:26:21,275 --> 01:26:25,513
They're only monkey boys! We can still
crush them here on Earth, Lord Whorfin!

1006
01:26:25,646 --> 01:26:28,616
No. It's time to go home.

1007
01:26:28,749 --> 01:26:32,486
Bigbooty, you carry my overthruster.

1008
01:26:32,619 --> 01:26:35,589
John O'Connor...

1009
01:26:35,722 --> 01:26:38,158
you stick by my side.

1010
01:26:45,899 --> 01:26:51,004
The great vehicle itself
is now in final boarding state.

1011
01:26:51,137 --> 01:26:53,640
What is that?

1012
01:26:54,507 --> 01:26:58,611
It's a troop ship. Lord Whorfin.

1013
01:27:03,783 --> 01:27:07,119
Massacre them without quarter!

1014
01:27:23,335 --> 01:27:28,774
Tell the flight attendants to close
the doors and prepare for a crosscheck.

1015
01:27:38,416 --> 01:27:44,089
If you are not inside the great vehicle
itself, you have missed the boat.

1016
01:27:46,691 --> 01:27:51,662
We are go for launch.
Do not obstruct the great vehicle.

1017
01:27:53,531 --> 01:27:55,399
Do not take to the floor.

1018
01:27:55,533 --> 01:27:59,370
Lord Whorfin will return
for all those left behind.

1019
01:27:59,503 --> 01:28:04,909
Clear the great vehicle. Voltage is rising.
Electromagnetic field is rising.

1020
01:28:10,614 --> 01:28:13,717
John O'Connor! Install my overthruster!

1021
01:28:13,851 --> 01:28:17,254
...all carry-on baggage
overhead and secure.

1022
01:28:17,387 --> 01:28:19,523
Electromagnetic field...

1023
01:28:19,623 --> 01:28:24,628
- What is this?
- It looks like one of our thermopods.

1024
01:28:24,761 --> 01:28:26,796
But it's a very bad design.

1025
01:28:28,932 --> 01:28:34,804
Your tray tables are secure, and your
seat backs in the full upright position.

1026
01:28:34,938 --> 01:28:38,141
Your overthruster
is in place, Lord Whorfin.

1027
01:28:38,274 --> 01:28:40,510
It won't work! It won't work!

1028
01:28:40,643 --> 01:28:43,746
Shut up, John Bigbooty, you coward!

1029
01:28:43,880 --> 01:28:47,516
You're the weakest individual
I ever know!

1030
01:28:48,584 --> 01:28:50,619
We are cooking. Over.

1031
01:28:52,254 --> 01:28:56,458
Get away from that, boy,
or I'll drink your blood!

1032
01:28:59,061 --> 01:29:02,698
What you got there, son?
That's not real, is it?

1033
01:29:05,667 --> 01:29:06,535
Get 'em up.

1034
01:29:06,668 --> 01:29:11,573
H2 tank pressurisation, OK.
We're go for launch.

1035
01:29:11,673 --> 01:29:17,646
John Many Jars, establish overthruster
beam red. Over. Activate oscillator.

1036
01:29:18,780 --> 01:29:22,350
Pace accelerator's shorting out!

1037
01:29:22,484 --> 01:29:25,320
John O'Connor! My overthruster!

1038
01:29:34,128 --> 01:29:37,832
Wait! Don't leave! Don't leave!

1039
01:29:37,965 --> 01:29:40,835
This is vacuum cylinder three.

1040
01:29:47,174 --> 01:29:50,811
If he can't connect the dots,
they never gonna penetrate.

1041
01:29:53,814 --> 01:29:58,418
Cabin fluid valves were closed.
Problem is corrected. Over.

1042
01:29:58,552 --> 01:29:59,553
What is that?

1043
01:29:59,686 --> 01:30:03,056
Is OK. No worry.
Is an insulating liquid.

1044
01:30:03,190 --> 01:30:05,759
Full speed ahead!

1045
01:30:05,892 --> 01:30:09,663
May I remind you to fasten your seat belts

1046
01:30:09,796 --> 01:30:12,732
and extinguish all smoking material.

1047
01:30:12,866 --> 01:30:16,502
We haven't a chance!
Your overthruster's for shit!

1048
01:30:16,636 --> 01:30:19,205
One more word out of you, Bigbooty...

1049
01:30:19,339 --> 01:30:22,608
Bigbooté! Té! Té!

1050
01:30:24,911 --> 01:30:28,981
Welcome aboard, Banzai. You're next.

1051
01:30:31,183 --> 01:30:33,385
Let's go home.

1052
01:30:41,393 --> 01:30:43,962
The wall is softening.

1053
01:30:45,597 --> 01:30:49,234
- Inertial overtones obtaining command.
- Oh, no.

1054
01:31:01,579 --> 01:31:06,918
Danger! Danger! We do not have
crossover. Negative mass is spreading.

1055
01:31:13,858 --> 01:31:18,129
We're not in the Eighth Dimension.
We are over New Jersey.

1056
01:31:18,262 --> 01:31:19,997
All is not lost...

1057
01:31:20,131 --> 01:31:22,800
Stand by to incinerate Smolensk.

1058
01:31:24,101 --> 01:31:25,469
Jettison!

1059
01:31:25,603 --> 01:31:29,440
So sorry, gentlemen,
but I must dump the excess baggage.

1060
01:31:34,411 --> 01:31:37,281
Arrivederci, Banzai!

1061
01:31:38,982 --> 01:31:43,520
- Where's the power?
- I'm a diplomat! I failed flight school.

1062
01:31:43,987 --> 01:31:46,122
What do we do, jump-start it?

1063
01:32:12,448 --> 01:32:15,551
Rocket stabiliser.

1064
01:32:15,684 --> 01:32:17,720
What this?

1065
01:32:19,655 --> 01:32:21,690
Looks like a gun.

1066
01:32:26,695 --> 01:32:29,031
John Parker, take this wheel.

1067
01:32:32,334 --> 01:32:36,204
Right, just... just hold onto that.
It flies like a truck.

1068
01:32:36,338 --> 01:32:38,306
Good. What is a truck?

1069
01:32:38,406 --> 01:32:42,477
Electric beam is fine, Lord Whorfin.

1070
01:33:03,531 --> 01:33:05,699
Thermopod on our tail. Over.

1071
01:33:05,833 --> 01:33:09,370
Banzai! Oh, so you wanna play games?

1072
01:33:09,503 --> 01:33:14,575
- Let's just stabilise her?
- Wanna play hide-and-seek? Huh?

1073
01:33:14,708 --> 01:33:20,414
OK. OK. Start left. Go left. More, more,
more, more. Left, left. Left! I said left!

1074
01:33:20,547 --> 01:33:23,283
- This is left!
- I mean my left. Go your right.

1075
01:33:23,417 --> 01:33:24,651
Go.

1076
01:33:24,784 --> 01:33:27,153
Feet, do your stuff!

1077
01:33:27,287 --> 01:33:29,255
Faster! He's gaining.

1078
01:33:29,389 --> 01:33:34,994
More, more, more. Lock in, lock in,
lock in. Now dive, dive, dive, dive, dive.

1079
01:33:35,128 --> 01:33:37,997
Whorfin... sayonara.

1080
01:33:40,266 --> 01:33:46,038
Banzai! I'll see you in hell!

1081
01:33:47,373 --> 01:33:49,575
We've got him!

1082
01:33:50,476 --> 01:33:52,945
- Pull up!
- It's stuck!

1083
01:33:59,585 --> 01:34:01,954
John Whorfin... destroyed.

1084
01:34:03,455 --> 01:34:05,657
Deactivate particle beam.

1085
01:34:05,791 --> 01:34:10,128
Tracking 0-0-0.

1086
01:34:56,840 --> 01:34:58,742
I thought you bought it.

1087
01:34:58,875 --> 01:35:01,278
- Yeah, me too. Where's Penny?
- At the bus.

1088
01:35:01,445 --> 01:35:03,547
New Jersey helped me bring her back.

1089
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:06,249
- How is she?
- He said he'd pull her through.

1090
01:35:06,383 --> 01:35:09,185
Quite a guy, if you want my opinion.

1091
01:35:10,120 --> 01:35:11,755
You give me that gizmo

1092
01:35:11,888 --> 01:35:17,393
and I'll give you a brand new
crisp $20 bill. Huh?

1093
01:35:18,828 --> 01:35:23,066
- All right, I'll tell you what...
- Hey, Scooter! Fall in.

1094
01:35:28,404 --> 01:35:31,273
This what you're looking for, Buckaroo?

1095
01:35:32,608 --> 01:35:37,246
- Scooter... you got his job.
- All right!

1096
01:35:37,379 --> 01:35:40,516
- Wanna ride with me in the jet car?
- Wow! You know.

1097
01:35:40,716 --> 01:35:42,985
But I have to ask my dad first.

1098
01:35:43,619 --> 01:35:46,488
OK, you ask your dad, I'll wash up.

1099
01:35:50,959 --> 01:35:52,594
Aw.

1100
01:35:58,333 --> 01:36:00,368
I did all I could.

1101
01:36:03,705 --> 01:36:07,809
Buckaroo, President's on line one. Calling about is
everything OK with the alien space cloud,

1102
01:36:07,942 --> 01:36:10,278
or should he go ahead
and destroy Russia?

1103
01:36:10,411 --> 01:36:13,314
Tell him yes on one and no on two.

1104
01:36:14,615 --> 01:36:18,085
Which was "yes"?
To destroy Russia or number two?

1105
01:37:21,714 --> 01:37:23,348
Penny.

1106
01:37:37,562 --> 01:37:39,597
Careful.

1107
01:37:42,233 --> 01:37:44,269
You're all right.

1108
01:37:47,672 --> 01:37:49,841
You look awful.

1109
01:37:49,974 --> 01:37:55,112
You don't exactly light up
a party yourself... Penny Priddy.

1110
01:38:06,590 --> 01:38:09,259
So what? Big deal!

1111
01:38:14,364 --> 01:38:18,068
