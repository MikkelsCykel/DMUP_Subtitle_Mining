00:00:00,194 --> 00:00:03,358
I'll be honest.
Before I came down from the room...

2
00:00:03,555 --> 00:00:08,673
...I took about a pound of Vicodin.
I'll be comfortable till late March.

3
00:00:13,603 --> 00:00:16,189
You're funny.
How do you live with him?

4
00:00:16,515 --> 00:00:17,824
She doesn't.

5
00:00:19,139 --> 00:00:20,994
She lives with someone else.

6
00:00:24,004 --> 00:00:28,706
Must've been exciting working with
Hal Weidmann. Were you apprehensive?

7
00:00:28,899 --> 00:00:31,966
Oh, no. No, Hal's brilliant.

8
00:00:33,156 --> 00:00:36,986
He's so easy to work with.
He loves actors.

9
00:00:37,188 --> 00:00:38,846
Just loves actors.

10
00:00:39,044 --> 00:00:42,305
You had a nervous breakdown
recently, didn't you?

11
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:43,899
What?

12
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,672
Can audiences watch you without
recalling your attack on Ms. Harrison?

13
00:00:49,893 --> 00:00:52,227
That's five minutes. Thank you.

14
00:00:54,116 --> 00:00:57,947
It was so great meeting you guys.
I'm a huge fan.

15
00:00:58,277 --> 00:00:59,226
Lunch?

16
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:06,302
Why does he get a neck-rub?

17
00:01:06,502 --> 00:01:08,411
- I want one.
- He's so tense.

18
00:01:08,614 --> 00:01:13,054
Hello? I have a neck too.
This thing holding up my head.

19
00:01:13,253 --> 00:01:14,235
And we're back.

20
00:01:15,077 --> 00:01:17,248
- Everybody ready?
- Of course.

21
00:01:18,918 --> 00:01:19,900
Of course.

22
00:01:23,174 --> 00:01:27,036
Hello again, Syracuse.
Mort Josephson, your Movie Maven.

23
00:01:27,238 --> 00:01:30,501
Ann Arbor, I'm Laura Messinger,
the Cinemaniac.

24
00:01:30,695 --> 00:01:32,898
- Popcorn's buttered.
- Lights dim.

25
00:01:33,095 --> 00:01:34,556
- It's Bob...
- And Ken.

26
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:36,515
At the Multiplex.

27
00:01:36,839 --> 00:01:40,669
We're great friends.
We talk every day.

28
00:01:41,063 --> 00:01:43,485
We're better friends than ever.

29
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:46,240
We talk two, three times a day.

30
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:51,622
We're just cosmically, spiritually
bound. Eddie's really good...

31
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:54,247
...and he's my pillar of strength.

32
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:57,920
It's like Sodom and Gomorrah.
So strong, you know?

33
00:01:58,119 --> 00:01:59,396
And that's five.

34
00:01:59,816 --> 00:02:02,815
In spite of all
the emotion and hurt...

35
00:02:03,016 --> 00:02:05,919
...we leaned on each other for
support.

36
00:02:06,536 --> 00:02:11,522
That's when I realized how strong
our friendship really was.

37
00:02:12,776 --> 00:02:14,750
- We're in constant contact.
- Right.

38
00:02:14,952 --> 00:02:17,473
I mean, not only
are we great friends...

39
00:02:17,672 --> 00:02:20,487
...and not only are we
in constant contact...

40
00:02:20,681 --> 00:02:22,753
You should see our phone bills.

41
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:24,607
We've also done...

42
00:02:24,808 --> 00:02:29,064
I don't know, how should I put this?
Hell, I'll just say it.

43
00:02:29,257 --> 00:02:33,086
We've done a few three-ways.
This guy she's with now...

44
00:02:33,289 --> 00:02:36,136
I can't say I'm happy. She's my wife.

45
00:02:36,457 --> 00:02:40,833
But after spending time in the sack
with him, I see the attraction.

46
00:02:41,321 --> 00:02:45,761
But for a fairly big guy, he's not
packing much south of the border.

47
00:02:45,994 --> 00:02:48,808
And that's five minutes.
Thank you so much.

48
00:02:49,034 --> 00:02:52,613
Say hi to everybody in Salt Lake.
Good to see you.

49
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:53,759
Next.

50
00:02:54,058 --> 00:02:55,487
- Hi, guys!
- Hi, guys.

51
00:02:55,754 --> 00:02:58,023
- That wasn't funny.
- It was a joke.

52
00:02:58,218 --> 00:03:01,831
- I do that after 400 interviews.
- Hector won't find it funny.

53
00:03:02,027 --> 00:03:05,507
Guess what? I don't give
a shit what he thinks.

54
00:03:06,059 --> 00:03:08,131
Take a picture with my baby?

55
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:10,346
Just smile and shut up.

56
00:03:16,171 --> 00:03:18,954
- You have given me 110%/% today.
- Who has?

57
00:03:19,147 --> 00:03:21,057
You. It's been a great day.

58
00:03:21,259 --> 00:03:23,910
- What do you want?
- A small favor.

59
00:03:24,107 --> 00:03:25,635
45 minutes, an hour.

60
00:03:25,835 --> 00:03:28,323
I need you to have dinner with Gwen.

61
00:03:28,523 --> 00:03:30,825
- It'll be great.
- I won't do it.

62
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:35,362
- You should do this.
- I'm gonna be alone with the minibar.

63
00:03:35,563 --> 00:03:38,947
We're in deep shit.
Hal's holding the film hostage.

64
00:03:39,148 --> 00:03:43,458
We have nothing! Understand?
But I do have you. You and Gwen.

65
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:46,726
When you're together,
the press forgets that.

66
00:03:46,924 --> 00:03:49,859
It's roses blooming,
flags flying, pudding...

67
00:03:50,061 --> 00:03:52,101
- Are you on something?
- A panic high.

68
00:03:52,301 --> 00:03:56,098
Just order an entree,
chew a little bit, smile and go.

69
00:03:56,301 --> 00:04:00,328
They have delightful pork tenderloin.
8:00. Thank you so much!

70
00:04:00,525 --> 00:04:01,987
- It's Gwen's idea.
- Really?

71
00:04:02,189 --> 00:04:03,204
Absolutely.

72
00:04:04,141 --> 00:04:06,890
I can't believe you said
I'd have dinner.

73
00:04:07,085 --> 00:04:09,802
They serve a very nice
pork tenderloin.

74
00:04:09,997 --> 00:04:12,648
I'm not going. Here.

75
00:04:12,846 --> 00:04:16,261
I was with him enough today
for the rest of my life.

76
00:04:16,462 --> 00:04:20,291
- I gotta give him the divorce papers.
- When?

77
00:04:20,781 --> 00:04:22,309
Just before we leave.

78
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:26,124
What, toss them at him
as your limo pulls away?

79
00:04:26,318 --> 00:04:29,482
You don't understand.
It's very complicated.

80
00:04:29,678 --> 00:04:34,567
Being nice makes giving him the papers
easier, but then he gets hopeful.

81
00:04:35,535 --> 00:04:37,542
- Is that your foot?
- Sorry.

82
00:04:38,575 --> 00:04:40,200
Pedicure. Hello?

83
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:44,620
- So when you're nice, he thinks...
- I can't talk about it right now.

84
00:04:44,814 --> 00:04:48,612
It's so hard being someone
people just don't get over.

85
00:04:49,135 --> 00:04:52,332
- Tell him I have a headache.
- I won't lie for you.

86
00:04:52,527 --> 00:04:55,593
- You lie for me all the time.
- Not to him.

87
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:58,890
This is high school all over again.

88
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:03,274
When you wanted to break up
with a boyfriend, I had to do it.

89
00:05:03,471 --> 00:05:05,610
- You did not.
- Oh, please.

90
00:05:05,808 --> 00:05:10,249
Let's refresh your memory.
Robert Mancuta? Kyle Hassler?

91
00:05:10,448 --> 00:05:14,539
Half the lacrosse team?
I was the most hated girl in school.

92
00:05:14,736 --> 00:05:15,684
That's untrue.

93
00:05:15,888 --> 00:05:20,777
My quote in the yearbook was,
"Hey, we have to talk." I was hated.

94
00:05:20,977 --> 00:05:21,992
Fine.

95
00:05:22,352 --> 00:05:23,629
Don't go.

96
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:28,080
Eddie will sit there like an idiot,
and it'll be all your fault.

97
00:05:29,457 --> 00:05:30,798
Whatever.

98
00:05:35,697 --> 00:05:37,191
- How are you?
- Lee.

99
00:05:37,649 --> 00:05:39,438
- Where's the film?
- What?

100
00:05:39,697 --> 00:05:43,178
In its canister, waiting to be shown,
to go into history.

101
00:05:43,378 --> 00:05:44,555
There is no film.

102
00:05:44,754 --> 00:05:48,944
What have I seen five times that
gave me the best feeling ever?

103
00:05:49,137 --> 00:05:51,821
You'll have a great time.
See you later.

104
00:05:52,273 --> 00:05:55,536
We're dead, we're doomed. Thank you.

105
00:06:11,859 --> 00:06:14,095
Look at you. You clean up good.

106
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,560
- Thanks.
- What's going on?

107
00:06:16,755 --> 00:06:21,458
Gwen isn't feeling well,
so she won't make it to dinner.

108
00:06:22,867 --> 00:06:25,584
- She isn't sick.
- Not physically.

109
00:06:27,059 --> 00:06:32,013
- I didn't want you to sit, wondering.
- Thanks. Really.

110
00:06:32,212 --> 00:06:34,929
Wanna join me?
Haven't you read the papers?

111
00:06:35,123 --> 00:06:38,538
I'm unstable. Don't let me be alone.
Come on.

112
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,496
- A few minutes.
- Yeah.

113
00:06:42,612 --> 00:06:44,368
We have an understudy.

114
00:06:44,948 --> 00:06:47,315
They never make it easy, do they?

115
00:06:47,988 --> 00:06:49,744
The house phone, please.

116
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:53,742
Thank you.

117
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:58,800
- Holly Golightly's cottage, please.
- Who's that?

118
00:06:58,997 --> 00:07:02,030
Gwen's code name.
From Breakfast at Tiffany's.

119
00:07:02,229 --> 00:07:05,906
- What's that?
- It's a movie, a great movie.

120
00:07:06,101 --> 00:07:08,240
- Hepburn?
- Right. Katharine.

121
00:07:10,582 --> 00:07:12,011
Listen to me.

122
00:07:12,213 --> 00:07:16,436
Don't tell anyone you're in the
movie business, okay? Thank you.

123
00:07:16,822 --> 00:07:18,862
Hello? Hey, Gwen, it's Lee.

124
00:07:19,062 --> 00:07:22,324
I'm at the restaurant,
and guess what? You're not.

125
00:07:22,517 --> 00:07:25,299
Are you okay? Oh, that's too bad.

126
00:07:25,493 --> 00:07:28,341
Eddie's with Kiki.
She looks unbelievable.

127
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:30,930
It's a bit "Hello, Young Lovers."

128
00:07:31,126 --> 00:07:34,901
I may have some fires to put out,
but that's my problem.

129
00:07:35,094 --> 00:07:38,028
Have a nice night.
Feel better. Okay. Bye.

130
00:07:38,326 --> 00:07:39,275
Five minutes.

131
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:41,389
- You're amazing.
- Take notes.

132
00:07:41,719 --> 00:07:43,311
"This is Larry Flange.

133
00:07:43,511 --> 00:07:47,056
I'm sitting with the lovely
and talented Kiki Harrison.

134
00:07:47,255 --> 00:07:50,420
You play a lesbian firefighter
on an oil rig.

135
00:07:50,615 --> 00:07:53,877
One word comes to mind: Typecasting.
Your thoughts?"

136
00:07:54,071 --> 00:07:56,144
You really want my thoughts?

137
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,865
- Larry.
- Larry.

138
00:07:59,351 --> 00:08:00,627
"Okay, Larry...

139
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:02,229
...the truth is...

140
00:08:04,952 --> 00:08:07,407
...after playing Madame Curie...

141
00:08:08,024 --> 00:08:10,129
...and discovering radium...

142
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,445
...I just thought it would be a hoot
to strap on those big rubber boots...

143
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:19,699
...kiss my favorite gal goodbye
and go fight some fire."

144
00:08:20,057 --> 00:08:23,831
- A very personal role for you.
- Very close to my heart.

145
00:08:24,024 --> 00:08:26,960
- That's funny. You're funny.
- I am. Yeah.

146
00:08:27,993 --> 00:08:31,539
Do you remember Silent Run?
We rented that go-cart?

147
00:08:31,736 --> 00:08:33,624
You attacked the director...

148
00:08:33,816 --> 00:08:37,647
- There was no attacking.
- You rammed him repeatedly.

149
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:41,297
- You rammed me.
- Ramming you was a different thing.

150
00:08:41,497 --> 00:08:46,516
And you rammed Gwen.
She was not laughing, and we were.

151
00:08:46,713 --> 00:08:49,234
- She wasn't happy.
- She was pissed.

152
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:53,972
- That memory kept popping in my head.
- Those were good times.

153
00:08:57,721 --> 00:09:01,748
- I'm sorry I didn't call you.
- She's your sister. I understand.

154
00:09:01,947 --> 00:09:05,362
But you're my friend.
I let myself get kind of...

155
00:09:05,562 --> 00:09:09,010
- It's good to see you now.
- It's good to see you now.

156
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:11,993
That's a nice necklace.

157
00:09:12,827 --> 00:09:15,641
- It's not really mine.
- I know.

158
00:09:15,835 --> 00:09:18,039
- It's Gwen's.
- I know.

159
00:09:18,235 --> 00:09:21,496
- She gave it to me.
- And I gave it to her.

160
00:09:23,483 --> 00:09:24,661
I know.

161
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:28,307
- It looks good on you, though.
- Thank you.

162
00:09:30,363 --> 00:09:31,857
What are you thinking?

163
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:36,021
I'm thinking something
I shouldn't be thinking about.

164
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:41,206
- Me too. What were you thinking about?
- How much I want that breadstick.

165
00:09:41,404 --> 00:09:43,226
You want to eat this?

166
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:46,803
No, I don't eat bread.
I just dream about bread.

167
00:09:47,005 --> 00:09:50,899
I've been doing a lot of
dream analysis since I cracked up...

168
00:09:51,101 --> 00:09:54,100
- At the center.
- At the center. And I believe...

169
00:09:54,716 --> 00:09:59,539
...bread represents something you want
but can't have. What do you think?

170
00:09:59,741 --> 00:10:03,865
Well, I think that
when I dream about bread...

171
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:05,970
...that would represent...

172
00:10:07,484 --> 00:10:08,564
...bread.

173
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:10,683
Pretty much.

174
00:10:12,285 --> 00:10:14,292
What are you thinking about?

175
00:10:15,293 --> 00:10:16,242
Gwen...

176
00:10:18,109 --> 00:10:19,091
...is here.

177
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:23,385
Sorry I'm late.

178
00:10:23,582 --> 00:10:26,778
- Thought you were ill.
- All better. Just like that.

179
00:10:26,974 --> 00:10:30,749
- Thanks. You can go.
- She doesn't have to go.

180
00:10:30,941 --> 00:10:32,568
- Stay.
- Good to see you.

181
00:10:32,766 --> 00:10:35,101
- I need mouthwash.
- Right away.

182
00:10:36,223 --> 00:10:37,684
So...

183
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,701
I hear they have
great pork tenderloin.

184
00:10:40,894 --> 00:10:44,789
- She didn't have to go.
- Thank you. You look great too.

185
00:10:50,367 --> 00:10:53,945
- Excuse me. Is Holly Golightly here?
- What's the name?

186
00:10:55,616 --> 00:10:58,485
- What's he doing here?
- I'll get rid of him.

187
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:01,884
Get a camera.
Film, tape, anything. Go!

188
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,901
It's Gwen Harrison.

189
00:11:04,127 --> 00:11:07,062
- Lee. We met the other day.
- Where is Gwen?

190
00:11:07,264 --> 00:11:09,947
- I want to see her.
- I won't get involved.

191
00:11:10,144 --> 00:11:12,413
How do we stop people in love?

192
00:11:12,608 --> 00:11:15,903
What are you talking about?
I want to see her now.

193
00:11:16,096 --> 00:11:19,959
I can't cover for them anymore.
They're in the restaurant.

194
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,608
They're right over there.
She's in the red dress.

195
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,535
- Hi.
- Hector!

196
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:32,154
Jesus.

197
00:11:32,353 --> 00:11:34,208
- That's all right.
- Hi, Gene.

198
00:11:34,401 --> 00:11:38,077
- Don't wave at him like that.
- I promote my movies.

199
00:11:38,273 --> 00:11:40,695
- I know.
- It's part of the biz.

200
00:11:40,897 --> 00:11:42,142
I apologize.

201
00:11:42,337 --> 00:11:43,712
- I'm sorry.
- Hector.

202
00:11:43,905 --> 00:11:46,142
- I apologize for him too.
- He's here.

203
00:11:46,337 --> 00:11:49,021
For why are you sitting with him?

204
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:52,224
Get in. Would you get out of the way?

205
00:11:53,474 --> 00:11:56,256
Good. Get that side. Let's go.

206
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:59,832
- What are you doing?
- Protecting the woman I love.

207
00:12:00,258 --> 00:12:03,804
- I'll let you two catch up.
- Why don't you be quiet!

208
00:12:04,002 --> 00:12:06,392
- I'll get to you soon.
- Don't point.

209
00:12:06,723 --> 00:12:08,479
Don't tell me what to do.

210
00:12:09,955 --> 00:12:13,303
- Don't you trust me?
- I trust you implicitly.

211
00:12:13,506 --> 00:12:16,605
It's this asshole I don't trust!

212
00:12:19,043 --> 00:12:20,832
What? What did you say?

213
00:12:22,498 --> 00:12:25,117
I hope he's not
making fun of my accent.

214
00:12:25,315 --> 00:12:29,244
Okay, enough! You guys enjoy
your little public display!

215
00:12:29,444 --> 00:12:30,392
I'm leaving.

216
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,185
Okay, pussy boy's leaving.

217
00:12:33,444 --> 00:12:35,931
What's wrong? You don't like that?

218
00:12:36,132 --> 00:12:38,619
Maybe you want to take a swing at me?

219
00:12:38,948 --> 00:12:40,672
Tall boy. Come on.

220
00:12:41,156 --> 00:12:42,432
What are you...?

221
00:12:43,556 --> 00:12:46,622
- What is that?
- Let's go. Please, make my day.

222
00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:51,649
You're a genius,
beyond my wildest expectations.

223
00:12:51,845 --> 00:12:55,161
Tracking's up.
Spielberg's moved off our date.

224
00:12:55,877 --> 00:12:58,080
This is good! Hit him! Hit him!

225
00:12:58,276 --> 00:12:59,683
- Who?
- Anybody.

226
00:12:59,877 --> 00:13:02,114
- I won't fight!
- You're a pussy boy.

227
00:13:02,373 --> 00:13:07,195
- I'm trying to find some peace.
- You want peace? Okay, he wants peace.

228
00:13:07,877 --> 00:13:10,429
- Pussy boy's leaving.
- Don't do that.

229
00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:13,696
- Hector, don't.
- Don't tell me "don't."

230
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:15,998
Maybe you want a piece of me.

231
00:13:17,221 --> 00:13:18,170
You see?

232
00:13:20,134 --> 00:13:21,628
Huh, pussy?

233
00:13:21,829 --> 00:13:26,270
I really don't think there should be
a problem here. After all...

234
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:29,819
...you took my wife and I tried
to kill you. We're even.

235
00:13:30,022 --> 00:13:31,745
You crumpled duck!

236
00:13:33,574 --> 00:13:35,461
Oh! Dear me!

237
00:13:39,654 --> 00:13:40,799
Go away!

238
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:45,986
Punk! You hungry?
Eat this, punk! Eat it!

239
00:13:46,406 --> 00:13:47,868
Are you hungry?!

240
00:13:51,687 --> 00:13:53,377
I love your work.

241
00:14:01,735 --> 00:14:03,229
You forgot something.

242
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,865
- Did you see him go down?
- Shut up.

243
00:14:09,191 --> 00:14:12,770
- Why'd you have to do that?
- I didn't have to. I wanted to.

244
00:14:12,968 --> 00:14:16,263
- Just deal with it. In there.
- It was my pleasure.

245
00:14:19,336 --> 00:14:20,580
Did you see that?

246
00:14:24,361 --> 00:14:26,849
- Are you okay?
- Everybody back, please.

247
00:14:28,424 --> 00:14:30,082
Eddie! Are you okay?

248
00:14:30,281 --> 00:14:34,274
I can feel my nose in the back
of my throat. Is that bad?

249
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:35,902
Can you hear me?

250
00:14:37,161 --> 00:14:40,008
- Let's all just step back.
- Some ice, please.

251
00:14:40,265 --> 00:14:43,396
I swear to God,
Gwen can be just horrible.

252
00:14:43,593 --> 00:14:48,514
How can you love someone and not like
them at the same time? Seems strange.

253
00:14:48,937 --> 00:14:51,425
- You need to lie down.
- I thought I was.

254
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:55,487
Why don't we try sitting down?
There we go.

255
00:14:56,202 --> 00:14:57,959
Let me have a look.

256
00:14:59,114 --> 00:15:00,936
- It doesn't look good.
- No?

257
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:02,340
Cold.

258
00:15:04,042 --> 00:15:07,424
- What happened?
- I needed another humiliating photo op.

259
00:15:08,233 --> 00:15:10,918
I tried to walk away,
but he kept pushing.

260
00:15:11,114 --> 00:15:15,271
So I hit him in the tray with my face.
I should've walked away.

261
00:15:15,466 --> 00:15:19,263
For some reason, these days,
I do the stupid thing.

262
00:15:20,138 --> 00:15:22,179
This doesn't look good.

263
00:15:49,132 --> 00:15:52,067
- What was that?
- Another stupid thing.

264
00:15:52,588 --> 00:15:56,266
Stupid and maybe verging
on crazy or...?

265
00:15:56,877 --> 00:15:58,338
It's a fine...

266
00:16:02,348 --> 00:16:05,195
There he is. The master!

267
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:07,404
I'll have what he's having.

268
00:16:07,598 --> 00:16:11,754
I have to say, you have
completely outdone yourself.

269
00:16:11,949 --> 00:16:14,982
In 24 hours, we've had
a walk in the woods...

270
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,482
...a romantic dinner and a fistfight.

271
00:16:17,677 --> 00:16:20,231
I can't wait to see what happens next.

272
00:16:21,326 --> 00:16:25,003
Maybe I can get him to commit suicide.
You like that?

273
00:16:26,638 --> 00:16:28,547
Let me think about it.

274
00:16:29,678 --> 00:16:33,802
It won't help initial release
but video will go like crazy.

275
00:16:33,998 --> 00:16:38,308
- We could do a box like a coffin.
- Yeah. That's good. No, wait.

276
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:43,147
Imagine if he killed himself
at the premiere.

277
00:16:46,318 --> 00:16:49,896
I'm joking.
I'm thinking out loud or whatever.

278
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,097
- Good night, Dave.
- Good night, Lee.

279
00:16:56,719 --> 00:16:58,060
Good work!

280
00:17:19,952 --> 00:17:21,960
Good morning.

281
00:17:24,592 --> 00:17:25,672
How do you feel?

282
00:17:25,871 --> 00:17:27,814
I feel... I feel...

283
00:17:28,017 --> 00:17:32,392
I feel good. I mean,
I feel weird, but I feel good.

284
00:17:32,592 --> 00:17:35,461
- You?
- I feel something along those lines.

285
00:17:36,369 --> 00:17:38,191
Good, weird. Weird, good.

286
00:17:38,768 --> 00:17:42,479
Here's what I was thinking.
What about breakfast?

287
00:17:43,089 --> 00:17:44,977
We'll take it from there.

288
00:17:47,761 --> 00:17:52,169
Why don't you order some breakfast?
I'll brush my teeth first.

289
00:17:52,594 --> 00:17:56,140
- Can I use your toothbrush?
- Yeah, it's in there.

290
00:18:02,578 --> 00:18:04,585
Can I get some juice?

291
00:18:06,706 --> 00:18:08,167
Keek? Hello?

292
00:18:08,434 --> 00:18:10,092
Where are you?

293
00:18:13,906 --> 00:18:15,336
Want some toast?

294
00:18:17,714 --> 00:18:19,372
You buttered my toast.

295
00:18:20,691 --> 00:18:22,414
No one's done that before.

296
00:18:22,611 --> 00:18:26,157
I don't eat toast with butter...
I don't eat toast.

297
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:29,486
I'll stop talking now
and make an exception.

298
00:18:29,684 --> 00:18:31,178
Want some tea?

299
00:18:34,675 --> 00:18:35,690
It's hot.

300
00:18:35,923 --> 00:18:38,029
- Here. Okay.
- Thank you.

301
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:47,053
No, I'm fine. I look like
half a raccoon. What's up?

302
00:18:47,443 --> 00:18:50,259
Now's not a good time.
Can we do it later?

303
00:18:50,453 --> 00:18:53,170
No, don't come here. I'll come there.

304
00:18:53,524 --> 00:18:54,473
Bye.

305
00:18:55,444 --> 00:18:56,786
That was Gwen.

306
00:18:57,076 --> 00:18:59,345
- She wants to talk.
- About what?

307
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:02,410
I don't know, she didn't say.
But I better...

308
00:19:02,613 --> 00:19:07,282
...go over there.
- Why didn't you say you'd talk later?

309
00:19:07,477 --> 00:19:10,444
She said she'd come here,
and I thought...

310
00:19:10,644 --> 00:19:15,763
...that's not a good idea so I better
go over there, given the situation.

311
00:19:15,957 --> 00:19:20,878
- Will you tell her about last night?
- I don't know. I'll just let her talk.

312
00:19:21,845 --> 00:19:23,372
Know what I mean?

313
00:19:23,574 --> 00:19:27,021
Sounds like it's important
so I'll let her say it.

314
00:19:27,222 --> 00:19:30,004
Then I'll go do these dumb interviews.

315
00:19:30,198 --> 00:19:34,354
I'll come back and we'll lunch
together. Does that sound good?

316
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:55,186
You look terrible.

317
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:58,097
- Does it hurt?
- Only when I'm awake.

318
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,525
- He's not here.
- Who?

319
00:20:00,727 --> 00:20:03,761
- Hector.
- That doesn't matter. Is Kiki here?

320
00:20:03,959 --> 00:20:05,203
I doubt it.

321
00:20:09,271 --> 00:20:12,850
- I don't know where that girl is.
- That girl is here.

322
00:20:14,456 --> 00:20:18,034
Nice of you to join us.
Where have you been?

323
00:20:18,231 --> 00:20:21,298
Got up early. Things to do.
Nothing important.

324
00:20:22,457 --> 00:20:26,580
Would you make scrambled eggs?
She makes great scrambled eggs.

325
00:20:26,776 --> 00:20:29,591
- I remember.
- Would you like some?

326
00:20:30,232 --> 00:20:33,910
- Two orders. Make mine runny.
- Let's get room service.

327
00:20:34,105 --> 00:20:35,959
It would be my pleasure.

328
00:20:38,713 --> 00:20:40,916
What did you want to talk about?

329
00:20:42,009 --> 00:20:44,824
I think you're doing pretty well, huh?

330
00:20:45,017 --> 00:20:47,734
- Are you feeling okay?
- Yeah, I'm better.

331
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:49,817
I'm shocking myself.

332
00:20:50,521 --> 00:20:52,822
"I forgot how charming you were."

333
00:20:53,017 --> 00:20:56,880
"You, Miss Julep, are a warm breeze
on a cool afternoon."

334
00:20:58,586 --> 00:20:59,535
What was that?

335
00:20:59,865 --> 00:21:01,458
"What was that?"

336
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:04,400
- What movie was that?
- I don't know.

337
00:21:04,602 --> 00:21:07,057
What was that movie called?

338
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:09,461
I don't give a shit!

339
00:21:10,682 --> 00:21:14,959
- No, that wasn't it.
- You look like you're in a good place.

340
00:21:15,162 --> 00:21:18,479
When I saw you and Hector,
I was so conflicted.

341
00:21:18,682 --> 00:21:22,993
Conflicted is the word du jour.
There's no question about that.

342
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,868
You know what that is? She's tired.

343
00:21:27,067 --> 00:21:29,205
- You seeing anybody?
- Excuse me?

344
00:21:30,011 --> 00:21:33,175
- Are you seeing anybody?
- Let me think about it.

345
00:21:35,387 --> 00:21:36,401
Not...

346
00:21:39,387 --> 00:21:40,696
You know...

347
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:44,180
- Not technically, no.
- What?

348
00:21:44,379 --> 00:21:45,874
Not technically!

349
00:21:50,555 --> 00:21:53,404
That's fascinating. "Not technically."

350
00:21:53,596 --> 00:21:57,011
That's sad. Really, that's a shame.

351
00:21:57,628 --> 00:22:01,240
Your eggs, darling sister.
I hope they're runny enough.

352
00:22:01,436 --> 00:22:05,147
And you! Son of a bitch!
Here are your eggs! There you go!

353
00:22:05,341 --> 00:22:07,446
- What's wrong?
- A lot, actually.

354
00:22:07,645 --> 00:22:10,906
I can't believe it's taken
so long to figure out.

355
00:22:11,101 --> 00:22:14,003
I'm going for a long walk
to simmer down.

356
00:22:14,204 --> 00:22:16,922
First, I'd like to cut
through the shit.

357
00:22:17,181 --> 00:22:21,970
He's not technically dating because
he's technically hung up on you.

358
00:22:22,173 --> 00:22:24,594
And you! You moron!

359
00:22:25,021 --> 00:22:28,218
She's only here to salvage
her precious career...

360
00:22:28,414 --> 00:22:31,065
...and serve you with divorce papers.

361
00:22:31,262 --> 00:22:34,459
I've done all I can do.
I'm going for a walk.

362
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:38,450
Leaving is just something
I've really perfected, so...

363
00:22:38,653 --> 00:22:40,858
...once more, with feeling.

364
00:22:41,886 --> 00:22:45,181
- She was more fun when she was fat.
- Is that true?

365
00:22:45,663 --> 00:22:47,321
- What?
- About the papers.

366
00:22:47,518 --> 00:22:49,209
Yes, but now I don't know.

367
00:22:49,406 --> 00:22:53,814
Seeing you, being in front of the
press with you... We have something.

368
00:22:54,015 --> 00:22:57,430
Maybe I've made a horrible,
horrible mistake.

369
00:22:57,631 --> 00:23:00,893
Maybe I should give you the papers.
I don't know.

370
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:04,283
You're the devil.

371
00:23:11,967 --> 00:23:15,317
- I want to talk. Hold on a minute.
- Let go of me.

372
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,342
- I want to talk.
- I don't!

373
00:23:17,536 --> 00:23:21,114
- Why not?
- You're an idiot. I'm an idiot too!

374
00:23:21,312 --> 00:23:23,701
In that respect, we belong together.

375
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:27,734
- It's a complicated situation.
- I'll un-complicate it!

376
00:23:27,936 --> 00:23:32,638
Forget about what happened between us.
It's not gonna work, all right?

377
00:23:32,832 --> 00:23:35,254
Last night? Last night was great.

378
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:39,319
But she calls you,
and you can't wait to get to her!

379
00:23:39,521 --> 00:23:43,896
What is that? It won't work.
You'll probably always think of her...

380
00:23:44,097 --> 00:23:48,090
...and I'll probably always wonder
if you're thinking of her.

381
00:23:48,288 --> 00:23:49,369
I just...

382
00:23:50,049 --> 00:23:52,602
- I need you to know one thing.
- What?

383
00:23:53,218 --> 00:23:56,185
That woman that you saw by the pool...

384
00:23:56,385 --> 00:24:00,379
That woman you just have to spend
the rest of your life with...

385
00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:04,286
That was me.

386
00:24:16,418 --> 00:24:18,174
- Good morning.
- Morning.

387
00:24:18,914 --> 00:24:21,369
So here's the buffet.

388
00:24:21,602 --> 00:24:23,064
What's going on?

389
00:24:24,483 --> 00:24:26,872
Nothing. I'm great.

390
00:24:27,267 --> 00:24:31,129
Just great. Ma'am, can I get
some more butter?

391
00:24:31,938 --> 00:24:34,393
When you hit Formica, stop.

392
00:24:34,626 --> 00:24:37,791
You know the expression
"falling off the wagon"?

393
00:24:37,988 --> 00:24:41,283
But you got 30 pounds of food
to break your fall.

394
00:24:41,476 --> 00:24:45,698
- What the hell happened?
- Bad morning. Preceded by 33 bad years.

395
00:24:45,891 --> 00:24:48,925
- Does this have to do with Gwen?
- Of course not.

396
00:24:49,124 --> 00:24:52,440
I love my sister.
I love everything about her.

397
00:24:52,643 --> 00:24:55,098
"Kiki? Kiki-kins?

398
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,405
Who's smoking? I smell smoke.

399
00:24:57,603 --> 00:25:02,339
Is someone smoking within a six-mile
radius of me? Stop them, Kiki."

400
00:25:02,533 --> 00:25:07,267
Oh, ma'am, the butter? There's
no butter? How can you run out?

401
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:10,308
- I have one theory.
- I need an assistant.

402
00:25:10,501 --> 00:25:13,796
If I had one, she'd be outside
milking a cow...

403
00:25:13,989 --> 00:25:16,738
...and I'd never run out of butter.

404
00:25:17,573 --> 00:25:21,316
"My butter has touched another food.
I need new butter."

405
00:25:21,701 --> 00:25:24,418
"Anything you want."
That's how it goes.

406
00:25:24,614 --> 00:25:26,980
You know. Anything they want, right?

407
00:25:29,093 --> 00:25:32,836
She's got a green dress.
Looks like crap on her.

408
00:25:33,158 --> 00:25:37,501
Brings out the bags under her eyes.
She gave it to me. It looks nice.

409
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:40,091
Then she said she wanted it back.

410
00:25:40,518 --> 00:25:43,616
She doesn't want me to have it.

411
00:25:44,197 --> 00:25:46,370
So you're in love with Eddie?

412
00:25:47,974 --> 00:25:52,032
- Wouldn't that be stupid?
- I've done every one of their movies.

413
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:55,361
He never looks at her
the way he looks at you.

414
00:25:55,558 --> 00:26:00,676
If you're in love, just go for it.
The way you went for this breakfast.

415
00:26:01,607 --> 00:26:04,923
Not the way you went
for the breakfast. That's...

416
00:26:09,992 --> 00:26:13,505
I think I'm gonna be sick.
Can you just...

417
00:26:20,936 --> 00:26:25,638
I'll take all of this to go.
I'll need 30 bags and a forklift.

418
00:26:27,751 --> 00:26:29,410
No laugh, no tip.

419
00:26:51,017 --> 00:26:53,833
I want to play someone
like the Terminator.

420
00:26:54,025 --> 00:26:57,320
I think the Hispanic people
are crying out to see...

421
00:26:57,513 --> 00:27:01,223
...a deadly, destructive
killing machine they can embrace.

422
00:27:01,417 --> 00:27:04,548
- That they can relate to.
- Nice to see you.

423
00:27:04,745 --> 00:27:09,797
How are you? Hal here yet?
He's a dead man. No, I'm serious.

424
00:27:09,994 --> 00:27:14,117
I know a guy. I'll make a call,
and he's dead, because...

425
00:27:14,314 --> 00:27:17,730
How are you?
Hope you're having a good time.

426
00:27:17,963 --> 00:27:19,490
- What time is it?
- 12:50.

427
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:20,835
We're doomed.

428
00:27:21,035 --> 00:27:25,671
May I suggest that you follow my lead
and get completely shitfaced?

429
00:27:25,866 --> 00:27:30,057
- Hi, how are you? You look gorgeous.
- Hi, Mr. K. Thank you.

430
00:27:30,251 --> 00:27:34,342
How long must I stay with the people?
They're drunk and touching me.

431
00:27:34,538 --> 00:27:39,360
Wait. If Hal doesn't bring the film,
they'll be busy building a gallows.

432
00:27:39,563 --> 00:27:41,506
I don't think that's funny.

433
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:47,268
Is that pussy boy?

434
00:27:52,044 --> 00:27:53,986
- He's gonna jump.
- He's not.

435
00:27:54,188 --> 00:27:58,247
- I said I'd give him divorce papers.
- Shit, he's gonna jump!

436
00:27:58,795 --> 00:28:00,356
- Excuse me.
- Please.

437
00:28:00,556 --> 00:28:02,279
- I'll do something.
- Get him!

438
00:28:02,476 --> 00:28:05,292
Let's take advantage of this.
Get some shots.

439
00:28:05,484 --> 00:28:07,623
- Shut up.
- All right, yeah. Okay.

440
00:28:08,237 --> 00:28:10,408
- Jump, jump.
- Jump, pussy, jump.

441
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:13,387
- Jump, pussy, jump.
- I can't believe this.

442
00:28:16,525 --> 00:28:19,046
- He'll be a pussy pancake.
- I'm coming!

443
00:28:26,606 --> 00:28:28,012
Why's he doing this to me?

444
00:28:28,205 --> 00:28:30,791
- I'm sorry! You okay?
- What are you doing?

445
00:28:30,989 --> 00:28:34,284
- I was stopping you from jumping!
- By killing me?!

446
00:28:34,893 --> 00:28:38,058
- Stay right there!
- Where am I gonna go?

447
00:28:38,254 --> 00:28:39,333
Right!

448
00:28:42,478 --> 00:28:44,933
Oh, shit. Hang in there, Eddie!

449
00:28:45,742 --> 00:28:46,887
I'm coming!

450
00:28:49,711 --> 00:28:51,271
- Okay.
- You're hosing me down?

451
00:28:51,471 --> 00:28:55,943
I'll throw it, and you catch it.
One, two, three.

452
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:03,686
Pull yourself up. I got you.
Come on.

453
00:29:04,719 --> 00:29:06,280
Got it? Good.

454
00:29:09,134 --> 00:29:11,044
Oh, my God!

455
00:29:13,008 --> 00:29:14,415
Pussy boy'll go splat.

456
00:29:14,639 --> 00:29:16,297
- Got it?
- Yeah.

457
00:29:17,327 --> 00:29:19,749
That's it. One foot at a time.

458
00:29:21,904 --> 00:29:23,529
- Okay.
- I'm gonna kill you.

459
00:29:23,728 --> 00:29:26,379
Take a bow. It'll look better.

460
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,989
Jesus Christ.

461
00:29:37,584 --> 00:29:40,399
Next time, take
a hair dryer into the tub.

462
00:29:40,593 --> 00:29:43,113
- I wasn't killing myself.
- Then what?

463
00:29:43,536 --> 00:29:46,318
I came here to think. Is that a crime?

464
00:29:46,513 --> 00:29:48,040
Do that in your room!

465
00:29:51,601 --> 00:29:53,194
I blew it.

466
00:29:54,161 --> 00:29:55,109
I lost her.

467
00:29:57,169 --> 00:29:58,730
Guy goes to his rabbi.

468
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:02,094
He says, "Rabbi, my wife
is trying to poison me."

469
00:30:02,289 --> 00:30:04,329
Rabbi says, "I'll talk to her."

470
00:30:04,529 --> 00:30:08,588
He comes back and says,
"I spoke to your wife for three hours.

471
00:30:08,785 --> 00:30:09,930
Take the poison."

472
00:30:10,866 --> 00:30:15,176
- You get it? You and Gwen are over.
- I don't care about Gwen!

473
00:30:15,378 --> 00:30:17,287
- I'm talking about Kiki.
- Kiki?

474
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:21,866
She's the only one worth spending
any time with in this hellhole.

475
00:30:22,194 --> 00:30:25,161
No offense.
You have some nice qualities.

476
00:30:25,363 --> 00:30:28,112
But for a review,
you'd sell me for medicine.

477
00:30:28,306 --> 00:30:30,510
- Don't let her get away.
- Too late.

478
00:30:30,706 --> 00:30:33,391
No, it's not. Trust me.
I'm telling you...

479
00:30:38,035 --> 00:30:39,279
- That's Hal!
- It is?

480
00:30:39,475 --> 00:30:41,995
He's here with the film! We're saved!

481
00:30:42,195 --> 00:30:45,065
- We're beyond saving.
- You wanna see the film?

482
00:30:45,268 --> 00:30:48,301
- I don't care.
- This could put you back on top.

483
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:51,915
- You think? On top?
- "May I have the envelope, please?"

484
00:30:53,427 --> 00:30:55,882
Hal! It's Hal. Hal!

485
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:05,038
- He's got the film. Go, go.
- He's the director.

486
00:31:05,236 --> 00:31:07,505
- He looks good.
- He looks great.

487
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:16,592
Let's get started. I'm Lee Phillips.
Welcome to Time Over Time.

488
00:31:17,044 --> 00:31:18,255
Thank you.

489
00:31:19,382 --> 00:31:21,902
I'll go out on a ledge here
and say...

490
00:31:22,997 --> 00:31:24,785
I couldn't help myself.

491
00:31:25,141 --> 00:31:29,036
Welcome the man responsible
for this junket, Dave Kingman.

492
00:31:31,446 --> 00:31:32,853
Thank you very much.

493
00:31:33,526 --> 00:31:37,748
They say that good things come
to those who wait.

494
00:31:37,941 --> 00:31:41,421
I waited 20 years to work
with the great Hal Weidmann.

495
00:31:41,621 --> 00:31:46,356
- Hal's cinematic influence has been...
- That's good. Thank you.

496
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:47,859
Thank you.

497
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:51,700
My name is Hal Weidmann. Hello.

498
00:31:55,447 --> 00:31:57,389
Ladies and gentlemen...

499
00:31:57,590 --> 00:32:01,845
...this is the most honest movie
I have ever made.

500
00:32:02,518 --> 00:32:06,774
I wasn't looking for it. It came
to me like a bus in the street.

501
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:11,888
Or the woman who changes
the flowers at our desert house.

502
00:32:12,855 --> 00:32:16,335
I can't talk about this film
without weeping. Roll it.

503
00:32:16,631 --> 00:32:19,796
Thank you, Hal.
Have a great time, everybody!

504
00:32:37,944 --> 00:32:40,148
Sarah. I'm Ben. We must speak.

505
00:32:40,344 --> 00:32:42,352
- Who are you?
- That's unimportant.

506
00:32:42,553 --> 00:32:46,295
What's important now is yoursafety.
You're in danger.

507
00:32:46,489 --> 00:32:49,172
This is hard to say,
so I'lljust say it.

508
00:32:49,369 --> 00:32:51,825
- I'm from the future.
- Oh, my God!

509
00:32:52,441 --> 00:32:54,743
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

510
00:32:54,938 --> 00:32:57,556
Come with me now. Now, Sarah, please.

511
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:04,693
Love is a bridge
built between two people.

512
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:09,746
We want what exists
between them to be real.

513
00:33:10,042 --> 00:33:12,049
My name is Hal Weidmann.

514
00:33:12,249 --> 00:33:16,952
The film you're about to see
is Time Over Time, oris it?

515
00:33:17,562 --> 00:33:20,246
The details are unimportant.
Simplyput...

516
00:33:20,442 --> 00:33:23,126
...the script was shit. I tossed it.

517
00:33:23,322 --> 00:33:27,000
- I let my camera capture real life.
- Just watch.

518
00:33:28,827 --> 00:33:31,925
I filmed my actors
without theirknowledge.

519
00:33:32,123 --> 00:33:36,345
I let the camera run after takes.
I placed hidden cameras around.

520
00:33:36,538 --> 00:33:39,572
And the end result is a story...

521
00:33:39,771 --> 00:33:44,822
...farmore involving than anything
manufactured by actors and writers.

522
00:33:47,355 --> 00:33:49,395
This is real life.

523
00:33:49,628 --> 00:33:51,188
Thejuice.

524
00:33:51,772 --> 00:33:53,146
The stink.

525
00:33:55,164 --> 00:33:56,146
The glory.

526
00:34:02,972 --> 00:34:05,754
Often, you wonder
where the budget goes.

527
00:34:05,948 --> 00:34:07,475
Shut up!

528
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:13,046
It's gonna be good.

529
00:34:13,373 --> 00:34:16,820
I don't mean to pressure you,
but we're 15 days over.

530
00:34:17,052 --> 00:34:19,867
- Oh, no.
- What are we gonna do?

531
00:34:20,061 --> 00:34:24,404
I'm in the middle ofshooting.
It's a sensitive time. Do me a favor.

532
00:34:24,605 --> 00:34:28,435
Go away. Please.
Never visit my set again.

533
00:34:31,773 --> 00:34:33,234
Watch him take it...

534
00:34:33,437 --> 00:34:35,030
...up the gazoo.

535
00:34:36,957 --> 00:34:41,081
You're an idiot. I told you
we nevershould've hired him.

536
00:35:23,647 --> 00:35:25,687
You're so good in this.

537
00:35:30,943 --> 00:35:31,958
Cut.

538
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:38,325
- Hal, can I get like three minutes?
- Three minutes.

539
00:35:38,528 --> 00:35:41,179
- Gwen, can I talk to you?
- I'm working.

540
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:46,776
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

541
00:35:46,977 --> 00:35:51,287
- His hands are all overyourass.
- My character would've done that.

542
00:35:51,488 --> 00:35:54,390
- You look like a prostitute!
- Oh, please.

543
00:35:54,592 --> 00:35:56,960
- Don't make a fool ofme.
- Cut it out.

544
00:35:57,153 --> 00:35:59,935
I'm watching you every minute.
You hearme?

545
00:36:00,129 --> 00:36:03,096
- Cut it out.
- Do you hearme?!

546
00:36:06,529 --> 00:36:09,596
- I think Eddie knows.
- Knows what?

547
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:11,963
About me and Hector.

548
00:36:12,802 --> 00:36:16,893
- You said nothing was happening.
- Well, something happened.

549
00:36:21,187 --> 00:36:22,364
You see thatzit?

550
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:26,592
- What the hell is this?
- You think I know?

551
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:28,599
You bastard!

552
00:36:29,026 --> 00:36:31,131
- You see it?
- I'll get something.

553
00:36:31,683 --> 00:36:34,617
- I slept with him.
- Hector?

554
00:36:35,906 --> 00:36:37,761
- Are you in love?
- Come on.

555
00:36:37,955 --> 00:36:41,751
It's not always about love.
Sometimes youjust need a lay.

556
00:36:44,547 --> 00:36:46,587
I tell you, he's hot.

557
00:36:46,915 --> 00:36:49,762
Handsome. He can go forhours.

558
00:36:50,883 --> 00:36:54,145
Just wish he had a bigger,
you know, thingy.

559
00:36:56,708 --> 00:36:57,952
I love this movie.

560
00:36:58,148 --> 00:36:59,740
What do you mean?

561
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:04,383
It's like a roll of quarters.
It's like this.

562
00:37:06,948 --> 00:37:10,625
- Well, maybe like this.
- Okay. I know too much.

563
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,962
I'm gonna scream.

564
00:37:16,164 --> 00:37:19,743
- I think it's very entertaining.
- Lee, get over here!

565
00:37:21,317 --> 00:37:24,284
You stop this right now.
I'll sue the studio.

566
00:37:24,485 --> 00:37:26,524
- Lower your voice.
- Shut up.

567
00:37:26,725 --> 00:37:29,573
- Cut the film.
- Excuse me. Was that deserved?

568
00:37:29,765 --> 00:37:33,377
I think so. You've ruined me.
You've ruined my career.

569
00:37:33,573 --> 00:37:37,021
Look at the screen.
Don't you realize what that is?

570
00:37:37,221 --> 00:37:39,555
That's reinvention. That's birth.

571
00:37:39,749 --> 00:37:42,881
That's life itself.
Can't you smell the life?

572
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:46,531
Pretty soon you'll smell
Ira Stern, my attorney!

573
00:37:47,717 --> 00:37:49,627
- Thank you, Hal.
- Wacko.

574
00:37:50,149 --> 00:37:54,657
The film's new direction caught
some of us a little bit off-guard.

575
00:37:55,238 --> 00:37:58,686
- I am shocked. I'm outraged.
- There are textures!

576
00:37:58,886 --> 00:38:00,991
Can I say something, please?

577
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:05,120
What was said about my penis
is completely false.

578
00:38:05,319 --> 00:38:08,897
I'm extremely well-hung.
I'll submit to an inspection.

579
00:38:09,095 --> 00:38:11,811
I knew this film
would be misunderstood.

580
00:38:12,006 --> 00:38:14,592
Kubrick was misunderstood. Godard.

581
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:17,279
I'll kick your ass! Understand that!

582
00:38:17,479 --> 00:38:19,454
- Who are you?
- Who am I?

583
00:38:19,655 --> 00:38:22,372
- I'm your ass-kicker!
- Can I defend my dad?

584
00:38:22,567 --> 00:38:24,389
No. Who's her dad?

585
00:38:24,743 --> 00:38:26,303
- Hal.
- No, you cannot!

586
00:38:26,503 --> 00:38:28,741
Let me defend Hector. We had sex.

587
00:38:28,935 --> 00:38:31,805
His penis is bigger
than a roll of quarters.

588
00:38:32,008 --> 00:38:33,535
- You slept with her?
- No.

589
00:38:33,735 --> 00:38:36,485
- You slept with her?
- I swear she's lying.

590
00:38:36,679 --> 00:38:40,935
The part about my penis is true.
It's bigger than coins.

591
00:38:41,128 --> 00:38:46,213
There will be a lawsuit. Invasion
of privacy, damage to my career!

592
00:38:46,408 --> 00:38:47,750
Yes, yes, I know.

593
00:38:48,296 --> 00:38:50,947
Congratulations.
It's my most honest work.

594
00:38:51,145 --> 00:38:53,381
- I'll work with you.
- I got a script.

595
00:38:53,577 --> 00:38:55,203
- You're great.
- I'll send it.

596
00:38:55,401 --> 00:39:00,070
I have an announcement to make.
I'd like to thank you all.

597
00:39:00,264 --> 00:39:03,975
I'm so happy you're here
and all our friends in the press...

598
00:39:04,169 --> 00:39:09,286
...who've been so supportive
this last year. I'm so happy to say...

599
00:39:10,121 --> 00:39:12,991
...that Eddie and I are getting
back together.

600
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:20,006
So thank you all so much.

601
00:39:20,202 --> 00:39:22,755
- What is this bullshit now?
- Be quiet.

602
00:39:22,953 --> 00:39:25,093
This is bullshit. Bullshit!

603
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:27,624
Today, Eddie came to the cottage.

604
00:39:27,818 --> 00:39:31,396
We had breakfast and a heartfelt talk,
didn't we, honey?

605
00:39:31,594 --> 00:39:34,244
I've wanted to get back
together with Gwen...

606
00:39:34,442 --> 00:39:38,698
...ever since we weren't together
anymore. I've obsessed about it.

607
00:39:38,891 --> 00:39:42,633
- How sweet.
- Now that it's happened, I must say...

608
00:39:42,827 --> 00:39:47,267
...l'm amazed and grateful. And I
agree with Hector that it's bullshit.

609
00:39:47,466 --> 00:39:49,125
Thank you very much!

610
00:39:49,579 --> 00:39:51,139
- We talked about this.
- No.

611
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:54,057
- We did. Don't you love me?
- We did not.

612
00:39:54,251 --> 00:39:57,218
I love the bright,
sexy woman up on-screen.

613
00:39:57,419 --> 00:39:59,044
- He loves me.
- The movie girl.

614
00:39:59,244 --> 00:40:03,172
That's not you. You're good
at pretending to be real.

615
00:40:03,371 --> 00:40:06,633
I think I'm with
the real you, but I'm not.

616
00:40:06,859 --> 00:40:11,137
I'm with the real you,
not the movie you. I don't want that.

617
00:40:11,341 --> 00:40:12,901
- Why?
- I just explained it.

618
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,140
- You did?
- I don't want to talk.

619
00:40:15,341 --> 00:40:17,730
- Not in front of these...
- Why not?

620
00:40:17,932 --> 00:40:21,794
What could I have to say to you
that I don't have to say...

621
00:40:21,996 --> 00:40:25,313
...in front of 300
international press members.

622
00:40:25,549 --> 00:40:28,844
I'll tell you why.
I'm in love with your sister.

623
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:37,989
Is this some kind ofjoke?

624
00:40:38,893 --> 00:40:41,282
Kiki, could you get over here?

625
00:40:46,222 --> 00:40:48,294
- Why her?
- Oh, why not?

626
00:40:48,493 --> 00:40:51,908
Is it so unbelievable
that a man could love me?

627
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:53,997
- Not now.
- Now is the time.

628
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:57,387
- You just wait for me!
- Can I say something?

629
00:40:57,583 --> 00:40:58,565
- Yes.
- No!

630
00:40:58,766 --> 00:41:01,516
Listen. Okay, one nut at a time.

631
00:41:01,871 --> 00:41:03,943
You're my sister. I love you.

632
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:09,388
You should know nothing happened
between me and Eddie until last night.

633
00:41:09,583 --> 00:41:12,965
I feel much better
about you stealing my husband.

634
00:41:13,167 --> 00:41:15,883
Ex-husband. I didn't steal anything.

635
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:21,131
You're the one shacked up for
the past year with Ricky Ricardo.

636
00:41:23,887 --> 00:41:27,270
Look, I am just tired
of making excuses.

637
00:41:27,471 --> 00:41:32,328
I am done picking up dirty clothes.
I am done pretending...

638
00:41:32,528 --> 00:41:34,917
...that your life is my whole life.

639
00:41:35,312 --> 00:41:37,003
I'm just... I'm done.

640
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,713
So what you're really
worried about is you, right?

641
00:41:43,953 --> 00:41:47,149
Well, I guess you're fired.

642
00:41:51,056 --> 00:41:52,747
Honey.

643
00:41:55,633 --> 00:41:59,081
You know all I care about
is your happiness.

644
00:41:59,281 --> 00:42:00,230
That's sweet...

645
00:42:00,433 --> 00:42:04,656
So don't worry about me.
I'll be fine.

646
00:42:08,818 --> 00:42:11,054
- You're unbelievable.
- Shut up.

647
00:42:11,441 --> 00:42:13,264
Next? What can I do for you?

648
00:42:13,457 --> 00:42:17,319
I shouldn't have said that
in front of everybody, but...

649
00:42:17,522 --> 00:42:19,889
I've been searching for clarity.

650
00:42:20,082 --> 00:42:23,759
All of a sudden I am so clear,
it's ridiculous.

651
00:42:24,274 --> 00:42:27,656
- I want to be with you.
- When did you decide this?

652
00:42:28,241 --> 00:42:30,631
The moment I thought I'd lost you.

653
00:42:31,059 --> 00:42:33,033
- Damn it.
- What?

654
00:42:33,362 --> 00:42:36,210
That was... That was good.

655
00:42:38,098 --> 00:42:42,060
No. No, this is crazy.
Eddie, this isn't gonna work.

656
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:43,535
Listen to me.

657
00:42:45,491 --> 00:42:47,433
I'm grateful for you.

658
00:42:48,658 --> 00:42:53,231
In all the world, the thing
I'm most grateful for is you.

659
00:42:56,787 --> 00:43:00,235
- Lf that's a line from your movie...
- That one's mine.

660
00:43:03,315 --> 00:43:05,803
- What do we do now?
- Traditionally...

661
00:43:06,004 --> 00:43:07,051
...we kiss.

662
00:43:18,965 --> 00:43:22,412
Give her some room.
Thank you. Step back, please.

663
00:43:22,964 --> 00:43:24,393
Easy, easy.

664
00:43:25,844 --> 00:43:27,885
I'm on pain medication...

665
00:43:28,085 --> 00:43:31,762
...that makes me say things
I'd never say otherwise.

666
00:43:31,956 --> 00:43:34,607
To set the record
perfectly straight...

667
00:43:34,805 --> 00:43:37,838
...Eddie and I never
had any plans to reconcile.

668
00:43:38,165 --> 00:43:39,114
And?

669
00:43:39,318 --> 00:43:41,805
And Hector is very well-endowed.

670
00:43:42,006 --> 00:43:45,868
Almost too well-endowed.
I've had complaints. Literally.

671
00:43:51,606 --> 00:43:53,614
- What are you doing?
- Packing.

672
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:56,593
- Let me help you with that.
- That's okay.

673
00:43:56,790 --> 00:43:59,211
That's... No, really...
Folding!

674
00:43:59,414 --> 00:44:01,716
Let somebody help you for once.

675
00:44:05,654 --> 00:44:06,766
There you are.

676
00:44:07,702 --> 00:44:09,229
That was unbelievable.

677
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:11,732
Like a movie with a stage show.

678
00:44:11,926 --> 00:44:14,894
If you'd tour with the film,
we'd be rich.

679
00:44:15,095 --> 00:44:17,779
And your sister is unbelievable.

680
00:44:17,975 --> 00:44:22,797
The entire country has voted her
off the island but, no! She's back!

681
00:44:22,998 --> 00:44:25,072
I've never seen anything like it.

682
00:44:25,271 --> 00:44:29,199
They like the film!
They call it The BlairBitch Project!

683
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:32,334
But the best news is you two.
Want a drink?

684
00:44:32,535 --> 00:44:34,357
- We're on our way out.
- Where?

685
00:44:34,552 --> 00:44:35,500
We don't know.

686
00:44:35,703 --> 00:44:39,632
Once in a while, good things happen.
I'll see you.

687
00:44:39,832 --> 00:44:42,679
There's a car,
so you can dodge the press.

688
00:44:42,872 --> 00:44:46,614
But I'll need you! We got work to do!
This one will work!

689
00:45:05,209 --> 00:45:08,111
Hi. Can I explain why I didn't call?

690
00:45:09,111 --> 00:45:19,111
