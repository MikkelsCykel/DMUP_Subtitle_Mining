00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:44,660
[rumbling]

161
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:00,860
Move in.

162
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,380
You hesitate, people die.

163
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,500
[beeping]

164
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,140
(man)
I checked it...

165
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,660
at least three times
before we sent it through.

166
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:41,220
Sanford Crosby,
UAC Public Relations.

167
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,420
Now follow me, please.
How many people
you got up there?

168
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,780
UAC employs 85 permanent
research staff on Olduvai.

169
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,500
[electronic beeping]

170
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,140
Welcome to the Ark, gentlemen.

171
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,980
(female computer voice #1)
Initiating
molecular mapping drive.

172
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:00,260
(female computer voice #2)
Initiating
molecular mapping drive.

173
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,980
[electronic beeping continues]

174
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,740
All personnel,
prepare for activation.

175
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:10,180
Keep your distance
from the core
or you might get sucked in.

176
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,700
You, uh, you done this before?

177
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,820
Once. Training mission.

178
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,900
Hope you had a good dinner,
Kid.

179
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,180
Inter-planet coordinate
lock engaged.

180
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,220
[electronic beeping]

181
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:23,220
All telemetry verified
and transmissions
are five-by-five.

182
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,940
Soon as we get through,
I need you to shut down
the surface elevator here.

183
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,140
Make sure that we get
the standard quarantine
of six hours.

184
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,820
Target receiver initialized.
Ready to proceed.

185
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:35,420
Ark travel,
15 seconds and counting.

186
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,340
[alarm sounding]

187
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,980
Five, four...

188
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,580
three, two...

189
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,260
one.

190
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,420
Why we gotta come
all this way?

191
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,780
Why can't UAC rent-a-cops
take care of this bullshit?

192
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,540
Is it always that rough?

193
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,900
Believe me,
it used to be a lot rougher.

194
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:15,820
There was a time when
Ark travel was susceptible
to, let's say...

195
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,580
major turbulence.
What's he mean?

196
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:22,500
He means he went
to one galaxy,
his ass went to another.

197
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,860
Call it
a scientific miscalculation.

198
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:31,460
Unbelievable as it may seem,
UAC does make
the odd tiny mistake.

199
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:35,020
Marcus Pinzerowsky.
You call me Pinky. Follow me.

200
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,780
(Sarge)
Where are the personnel who
aren't locked down in the lab?

201
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:38,820
In the atrium.

202
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,780
Pinky, put us up.

203
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:44,020
Activating remote personnel
surveillance.

204
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,780
[beeping]

205
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,420
Circle out men, on my three.

206
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,260
One, two, three.

207
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,300
Killcams up and running.

208
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,380
People, this room
is a code red, which means...

209
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,100
no one gets in
without our permission.

210
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,380
It stays ours at all costs.

211
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,700
Mac, stay here with our friend
and secure the door.

212
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,940
Men, on me. Let's move out.

213
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,140
Open the doors.

214
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,180
[hissing]

215
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,180
(man)
Who called in the military?

216
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,660
Where the fuck are we?

217
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,140
Couple million light years
from breakfast.

218
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,340
When can I start
evacuating people out
through the Ark?

219
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,700
We're at a Level 5 quarantine,
nobody goes anywhere.

220
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:47,860
Ladies, we're under
a Level 5 quarantine...

221
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:51,340
so I'm just gonna have to
strip search you girls.

222
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:54,260
(woman)
I don't think so.
(Portman)
Hold that thought.

223
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:57,260
We're under
a Level 5 quarantine,
so I'm just gonna have...

224
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,020
to strip--
(Sarge)
Portman!

225
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,780
Sergeant,
this is Dr. Samantha Grimm,
the UAC science officer...

226
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,860
assigned to retrieve data
from the lab.

227
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,940
Sergeant.
(Sarge)
Dr. Grimm.

228
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,340
(Samantha)
Hello, John.
Hello, Samantha.

229
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,780
Hello, Samantha!

230
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,460
(John)
Sarge,
this operation is a code red.

231
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,580
We really don't have room
for passengers.

232
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,940
Excuse me, but I have orders
to retrieve data
from three servers:

233
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:21,140
Anthropology,
Forensic Archeology,
and Genetics.

234
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,380
This is a military operation,
Doctor.

235
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:26,380
We're really not here
to retrieve
your science homework.

236
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:30,060
Look, I got an idea.
Why don't you ask your CO
what your orders are?

237
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:35,300
To contain
and neutralize the threat,
protect the civilians...

238
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:39,060
and retrieve--
retrieve UAC property.

239
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:42,340
We finally done here?
Because I've got a job to do.

240
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:45,140
(Samantha)
If you'll follow me?
You chose this, Reaper.

241
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,020
Is this gonna spoil my day?
No, sir.

242
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:51,140
Tell me you didn't let
a fine-looking piece of ass...

243
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,300
like that get away from you,
Reaper.
She's my sister.

244
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:55,300
No shit?
Don't do this again, man.

245
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,340
Do what?

246
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:59,140
There's three sections
to Carmack's lab complex.

247
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,540
Archeology, Genetics,
and Weapons Research.

248
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,500
You test weapons up here?
Well, it's a dead planet.

249
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:06,340
You want that stuff
tested here, where it's safe,
or in your own backyard?

250
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,780
We're primarily
an archeological operation.

251
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,220
Weapons Research is in
its own separate facility.

252
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,580
It has nothing to do
with Dr. Carmack's work.

253
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,220
How many inside
when the lab shut down?

254
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,780
Only Dr. Carmack's team.
That's six people.

255
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:20,660
In one of the carbon dating
labs, there was
an internal phone...

256
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,780
left off the hook.

257
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:24,060
Did you get any information
from it?

258
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,260

00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,180
All clear.

267
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,620
Pinky, give us a schematic.

268
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,340
Uploading to you now.

269
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,460
(Pinky)
Carmack's lab is isolated
from the rest of the facility.

270
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,580
The airlock is the only way
in or out.

Reaper, keep Dr. Grimm here
safe on her salvage op.

274
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:28,940
Duke and I'll take
the weapons lab, make sure
all the hardware's secure.

275
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,620
Be safe, gentlemen.

276
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:33,060

It's on.

You don't look like a ''Mac.''

Thirty minutes, tops.

You never did time, Portman?

What?

314
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:14,860
This is a holding cell.
Bullshit.

315
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,180

Hey, Sarge, what's the deal
with the sister?

323
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,540
Reaper's parents
led the first team
of archeologists to Olduvai.

324
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:05,140
They died in some accident
when he was a kid.

325

She followed in their
footsteps, and he didn't.

Oh, yeah, meet Lucy.

00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,220
Lucy, this is my brother,
John...

342
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,180
another creature
from the long lost past.

343
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,820
You found human remains?
Humanoid.

344
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,340
Lucy and her child
were our first major find.

345
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,460
We're bringing out more
every day.

346

You re-opened the dig?
I know I should have told you.

00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,780
I didn't figure it was
the sort of thing...

348
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:49,220
I could jot down on
a yearly birthday card.

349
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:51,540
It's been stabilized.
Bullshit.

350
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:54,820
You wanna talk about safe?
Like you took a desk job?

351
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:59,300
I'm a forensic archeologist,
John. I'll go where
the work is.

352
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:01,380
Is that the only reason
you're up here?

353
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:03,380
You wanna know
why I'm up here?

354
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,020
I'll show you. Come here.

355
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,940
This is Lucy's chromosome
profile. Notice anything?

356
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,500
My molecular genetics
is a little rusty.

357
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:17,380
What's the first thing
Dad taught us to look for?

358
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:26,540
She's got 24 pairs
of chromosomes.

359
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:29,980
Humans only have 23.
But what does
the extra pair do?

360
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,580
Makes her superhuman.

361
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,660
The extra pair makes
her super strong...

362
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:36,100
super fit, super intelligent.

363
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:38,820
Her cells divide
50 times faster...

364
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:41,220
meaning she heals
almost instantly.

365
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:44,340
The fossil record
indicates these people
had conquered disease.

366
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:47,500
We found no genetic disorders,
no viruses, no cancers.

367
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,980
[computer beeping]
So what, they were just
naturally superior?

368
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:52,060
No. Not naturally.

369
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:55,460
See, the earliest remains
we found only had 23.

370
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:58,820
We suspect this extra
chromosome may be synthetic.

371
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,380
Bioengineered?

372
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,260
That's a long word
for a Marine.

you could've spent your life
looking in a microscope...

375

instead of a sniper scope?

376
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:14,220
If they were so smart,
how come they're so dead?

377
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,460
We don't know.

378
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,380
Maybe they just went
with time.

Doctor,
you are going to tell me...

654
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:33,060
just what the fuck
is going on up here.

What?
Come here.

Come here!

This is ''what.''

God.

Have you
found anything like this...

661
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:47,340
on your archeological digs?

662
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:48,340
No.

663
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:50,140
Is there any way this thing
came from the outside...

664
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:51,140
from the surface?

665
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:52,980
The planet is completely dead.

666
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:54,900
It came from somewhere, lady.

667
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:56,340
Portman, shut up!

668
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:59,020
The atmosphere on the surface
can't support life.

669
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:00,140
Maybe it doesn't need air.

670
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:01,820
It could have come from
another planet or something.

671
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:02,940
What? Like an alien?

672
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:04,620
Look at that thing!

00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:06,580
You need to shut the fuck up!

674

(John)
That's not what we saw.

675
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:11,820
That isn't what Goat and l
shot at in Genetics.

of these fucking things?

677

Where are
your surface entry points?

678
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:18,980
There's a pressure door at
the end of the north corridor.

679
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:20,660
Destroyer, Kid, Portman,

Give me an update.

00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:23,620
Yes, sir.
Whatever this thing is...

682
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:25,700
it cannot get back
through the Ark.

683
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:28,140
Mac, I want you to arm Pinky
with a weapon...

684
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:31,220
with some ST grenades,
and seal the Ark door.

685
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:32,420
There's one other door.

Where?

687
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:36,380
The entrance
to the archeological dig.

689
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:41,140
Don't let anything
through the Ark.

690
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:46,780
Hey, wait. Wait a minute.
You can't leave me here.

691
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:48,260
I'm not a soldier.

692

Why don't you go
fuck yourself?

693
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:50,740
It's bullshit.

694
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:51,980
You're supposed to protect me.

695

Hold this open.

Don't be a wuss.

701

Little tension
between you and Reaper?

702
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:37,300
We just went
our separate ways.

703
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:41,020
Why does a talented student
throw it all away
and join the RRTS?

704
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:43,140
So, what was
he like before?

705
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:44,860
Who, John?
Yeah.

706
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:46,380
Empathetic, sensitive.

707
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:48,620
It's kind of hard for me to
imagine Reaper as sensitive.

708
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:52,660
I knew Reaper before all the
''drop down and give me 50,
woo-ha'' stuff.

709
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:54,860
Yeah?

Do you have a family?

I have Destroyer.
You know, we grew up together.

714
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:08,940
You know, Duke, I bet
secretly you have a big heart.

715
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:10,220
Oh, yeah?

716
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:14,620
And that's not the only
secret big thing I got.

717
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:16,740

Oh, lady,
you have no idea.

Right now, having sex
with me is practically
your civic duty.

in the procedure room.

on the left,
through the nanowall.

from getting out.

812
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:18,140
(John)
Mac, stand by.

813
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:19,340
Destroyer, report.

814
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:20,860
We've reached
the north airlock.

815
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:22,020
It's secure.

816
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:25,060
Console indicates nothing's
come in or out for 26 hours.

[creature growling]

Mac?

819
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:32,100
Mac.

820
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:35,780
Mac, Mac, you copy?

821
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:40,260
Talk to me. Talk to me, Mac.

822
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:43,580
Shit.

823
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:47,220
Jesus Christ.

826
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:56,460
(Mac)
We're in pursuit.
Moving fast out of the dig.

827
00:53:56,540 --> 00:53:57,900
(Sarge)
It's getting away.

828
00:53:58,060 --> 00:53:59,420
Pinky, what do you see?

829
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:01,460
It's big. Very big.

830
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:04,020
Moving fast,
back towards the lab complex.

831
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:08,020
Clear.

832
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:11,300
It's back in the lab.

833
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:14,180
[gun clicking]

834
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:16,460
Clear!

835
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:18,500
Clear.

836
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:20,660
Damn, it's fast.

837
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:22,820
All around defense, men.

838
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:24,140
Did you get it?

839
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:26,740
Pinky.
Yes, Sarge?

840
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:27,980
Anything gets through
that door...

841
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:28,980
use an ST grenade.

842
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:30,780
(Sarge)
It cannot get back to Earth.

843
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:34,620
He pops an ST in there,
he's gonna blow the Ark.

844
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:36,780
Reaper, Kid, pairs,
cover formation.

845
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:38,460
Sweep the corridors. Go.

846
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:41,940
Destroyer, you and Portman
stay here. Shut the airlock.

847
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:43,100
Maintain a perimeter.

848
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:44,300
He blows the Ark,
how the hell...

849
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:45,740
are we supposed to
get the fuck home?

850
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:47,820
Portman,
shut the fucking door.

851
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:49,380
Where you going?

852
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:51,180
I'm going to the armory.

853
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:53,340
I think we're gonna
need something...

854
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:54,940
with a little bit more kick.

Kidneys.

Dogs got kidneys, right?

866
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:05,860
Pigs got kidneys.

867
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:16,220
It's had its appendix removed.

This thing
didn't butcher Willits.

876
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:17,340
It is Willits.

877
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:18,940
What?

878
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:27,060
This is bullshit, man.

And Portman.

01:05:43,420 --> 01:05:44,660
What the fuck happened, man?

936
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:46,220

What the hell is this?

01:06:03,260 --> 01:06:05,620
And whose goddamn blood
is on that window?

942
01:06:05,660 --> 01:06:06,620
Goat's.

943
01:06:08,220 --> 01:06:09,340
He killed himself.

944
01:06:09,420 --> 01:06:12,420
What do you mean,
he killed himself?
He was already dead.

945
01:06:13,180 --> 01:06:15,140
It's true.
It's Goat.

946
01:06:15,580 --> 01:06:18,900
He was changing into
one of these motherfuckers
and he killed himself.

947
01:06:18,940 --> 01:06:21,220
We found two more scientists
at the dig.

948
01:06:21,460 --> 01:06:23,100
Thurman and a balding guy
with glasses.

949
01:06:23,180 --> 01:06:24,460
Dr. Clay.

950
01:06:26,980 --> 01:06:28,500
(Samantha)
Did you check their necks?

951
01:06:28,580 --> 01:06:30,260
Were there open wounds
on their necks?

952
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:32,580
We were conducting
a firefight, not an autopsy.

953
01:06:32,660 --> 01:06:35,340
(Sarge)
We came up here to find
six scientists.

954
01:06:35,420 --> 01:06:36,740
Four are known dead...

955
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:40,100
and Dr. Willits is
probably KlA somewhere
down in that sewer.

956
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:42,260
The only one missing
is Dr. Carmack.

957
01:06:42,340 --> 01:06:44,340
Has Dr. Carmack showed up yet?

958
01:06:45,180 --> 01:06:46,780
Oh, he's shown up all right.

959
01:06:47,740 --> 01:06:49,180
Look at the left ear.

960
01:06:52,060 --> 01:06:53,820
[grunting]

961
01:06:57,260 --> 01:06:58,620
Son of a bitch.

962
01:06:58,660 --> 01:07:00,620
I think this other one
is Steve Willits.

963
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:03,380
I'm going to run the DNA,
check it against his
med records.

964
01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:05,020
What are you people
working on up here?

965
01:07:05,100 --> 01:07:07,580
(Samantha)
We're analyzing bones,
artifacts.

966
01:07:07,660 --> 01:07:09,340
We're not doing
anything like this.

967
01:07:09,380 --> 01:07:11,060
Then what the fuck is that?

968
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:15,220
It must be a genetic mutation,
something environmental
or viral.

969
01:07:15,460 --> 01:07:16,660
I don't know.

970
01:07:17,460 --> 01:07:19,100
It may even be reversible.

971
01:07:19,420 --> 01:07:20,460
It's irreversible.

972
01:07:20,540 --> 01:07:21,820
(Samantha)
Not necessarily.

973
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:23,540
Dr. Carmack's condition...

974
01:07:24,660 --> 01:07:25,980
is irreversible...

975
01:07:26,660 --> 01:07:27,820
[grunting]

976
01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:29,820
[creature growling]
No!

977
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:30,860
[gun firing]

978
01:07:31,140 --> 01:07:33,300
because Carmack's condition
is that...

979
01:07:34,420 --> 01:07:35,460
he's dead.

980
01:07:36,540 --> 01:07:38,420
Kid, you and Duke...

981
01:07:38,900 --> 01:07:41,900
get back to the dig
and you make sure
those other dead scientists...

982
01:07:41,980 --> 01:07:43,260
are really dead.

983
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:50,860
I've lost...

984
01:07:51,580 --> 01:07:53,020
four soldiers.

985
01:07:53,660 --> 01:07:57,860
What are you people
experimenting with up here?

986
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:02,580
I'm not gonna ask you again.

987
01:08:03,620 --> 01:08:06,700
I told you,
it's an archeological
research center.

988
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:10,580
Do you think I'm lying to you?
Is that what you're saying?

989
01:08:14,420 --> 01:08:16,020
You think
I'm hiding something?

990
01:08:18,540 --> 01:08:20,060
I'm telling the truth.

991
01:08:25,340 --> 01:08:26,900
What were you downloading?

992
01:08:26,980 --> 01:08:28,820
What were you sent to protect?

993
01:08:30,780 --> 01:08:32,220
The research data.

994
01:08:33,820 --> 01:08:35,900
Research into what?

995
01:08:41,380 --> 01:08:44,860
(Dr. Carmack)
Subject was injected
with study agent at 00.:03.

996
01:08:45,380 --> 01:08:46,700
[Curtis groaning]

997
01:08:46,860 --> 01:08:51,540
Vitals normal, elevated
heart rate attributable
to subject anxiety.

998
01:08:51,620 --> 01:08:52,580
[Curtis screaming]

999
01:08:52,660 --> 01:08:57,220
C-24 successfully grafted to
subject's marker cells
at 00.:09.

1000
01:08:57,300 --> 01:09:00,380
He reconstructed chromosome
mutation on a human subject.

1001
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:03,620
We were never gonna do
human studies.

1002
01:09:04,380 --> 01:09:05,940
What the hell
are we looking at?

1003
01:09:07,260 --> 01:09:08,460
[sighing]

1004
01:09:08,540 --> 01:09:10,980
Genesis, Chapter 1 .

1005
01:09:12,060 --> 01:09:15,900
(Dr. Carmack)
Subject moved to protected
observation area at 00.:17.

1006
01:09:21,940 --> 01:09:24,460
Subject.: Curtis Stahl.

1007
01:09:25,260 --> 01:09:27,900
Crime.: Multiple murder.

1008
01:09:29,220 --> 01:09:31,980
Status.:
Condemned to execution.

1009
01:09:32,620 --> 01:09:34,340
[grunting]

1010
01:09:41,900 --> 01:09:43,460
Chromosome 24.

1011
01:09:45,420 --> 01:09:46,340
Oh, my God.

1012
01:09:46,540 --> 01:09:50,180
49 minutes after injection,
genetic mutations...

1013
01:09:50,220 --> 01:09:53,820
began to visually manifest on
subject's extremities.

1014
01:09:55,020 --> 01:09:56,900
[Curtis screaming]

1015
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:06,020
This is what you're
here to protect.

1016
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:07,860
It doesn't make any sense.

1017
01:10:07,940 --> 01:10:10,020
You trusted them.
They lied to you.

1018
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:12,500
They used you, Sam.

1019
01:10:13,020 --> 01:10:14,980
If he perfected xenogenesis--

1020
01:10:15,060 --> 01:10:17,140
Christ, don't you get it?

1021
01:10:17,220 --> 01:10:19,700
It's this place. It's hell.
It always was.

1022
01:10:23,300 --> 01:10:24,860
This shit ends here.

1023
01:10:26,580 --> 01:10:27,900
What are you doing?

1024
01:10:27,980 --> 01:10:29,660
We need to destroy
these discs.

1025
01:10:29,740 --> 01:10:31,180
That's UAC property.

1026
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:34,060
Fuck UAC, we take this back,
they'll just--

1027
01:10:34,380 --> 01:10:36,300
We take the data back.

1028
01:10:38,220 --> 01:10:40,620
Sarge, do you not see
what's going on here?
I didn't see shit.

1029
01:10:41,780 --> 01:10:43,620
And I ain't paid to see shit.

1030
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:45,460
I have my orders.
And so do you.

1031
01:10:48,060 --> 01:10:49,460
Is this everything?

1032
01:10:50,740 --> 01:10:53,180
I said, is this everything?

1033
01:10:53,580 --> 01:10:56,660
I, uh, have three
more to download.
Then do it.

1034
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:05,060
[gun firing]

1035
01:11:09,820 --> 01:11:10,780
(Kid)
Sarge?

1036
01:11:11,740 --> 01:11:12,740
We got a problem.

1037
01:11:12,820 --> 01:11:14,780
(Kid on radio)
One dead scientist is missing.

1038
01:11:15,620 --> 01:11:16,580
Now.

1039
01:11:19,020 --> 01:11:20,860
You just wanna leave her here?

1040
01:11:21,220 --> 01:11:22,740
She's got a job to do.

1041
01:11:25,660 --> 01:11:29,780
Look, this is Portman's comm.
You call if you need help,
okay?

1042
01:11:32,620 --> 01:11:33,900
You gonna be all right?

1043
01:11:35,940 --> 01:11:37,100
I'll be fine.

1044
01:11:37,340 --> 01:11:39,140
Okay. I'll see you soon.

1045
01:11:43,820 --> 01:11:45,340
(Sarge on radio)
Pinky, are you there? Pinky.

1046
01:11:45,420 --> 01:11:48,900
Sarge? Something is cutting
through the Ark door.

1047
01:11:48,980 --> 01:11:50,340
You have a visual?

1048
01:11:51,020 --> 01:11:52,660
(Pinky)
Oh, I got a visual all right.

1049
01:11:52,860 --> 01:11:54,620
Don't let it get to the Ark!

1050
01:11:55,180 --> 01:11:56,140
(female computer voice)
Five.

1051
01:11:56,220 --> 01:11:57,740
Pinky, use the grenade!
Four.

1052
01:11:57,900 --> 01:11:59,540
Use the goddamn grenade!
Three, two.

1053
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:01,300
Throw it!
One.

1054
01:12:17,980 --> 01:12:20,100
(Sarge)
Pinky's gone. That fucker ran.

1055
01:12:20,180 --> 01:12:21,100
Shit.

1056
01:12:21,340 --> 01:12:22,580
It got through.

1057
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:24,340
What the hell is that?

1058
01:12:24,380 --> 01:12:25,700
(computer voice)
System reboot.

1059
01:12:25,780 --> 01:12:29,300
Time required to begin
renewed operation.:
five minutes.

1060
01:12:29,380 --> 01:12:30,900
Quarantine cordon is breached.

1061
01:12:30,940 --> 01:12:32,860
This mission is
no longer containment.

1062
01:12:32,900 --> 01:12:35,180
Get all the weapons and ammo
you can. We're going through.

1063
01:12:35,260 --> 01:12:36,180
Move!

1064
01:12:36,380 --> 01:12:37,780
Sam, come in. Over.

1065
01:12:37,820 --> 01:12:39,900
Sam, do you read me? Over.
Come in!

1066
01:12:41,260 --> 01:12:42,700
She's not answering.

1067
01:12:43,060 --> 01:12:44,820
Time required to begin
renewed operation...

1068
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:47,180
four minutes and 45 seconds.

1069
01:12:47,460 --> 01:12:48,660
You got three.

1070
01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:57,020
Sam! Come in, Sam!

1071
01:13:08,820 --> 01:13:09,780
Sam!

1072
01:13:09,980 --> 01:13:11,980
Sam, why didn't you answer
your comm? We gotta go now!

1073
01:13:12,060 --> 01:13:13,820
Why did they take Goat
and not Destroyer?

1074
01:13:13,860 --> 01:13:15,740
Why Carmack
and not Dr. Thurman?

1075
01:13:15,820 --> 01:13:17,740
What?
Lucy had
the 24th chromosome...

1076
01:13:17,820 --> 01:13:18,740
but she wasn't a monster.

1077
01:13:18,820 --> 01:13:21,820
She died protecting her child,
not devouring it.

1078
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:24,460
Why did the same chromosome
that made her superhuman...

1079
01:13:24,540 --> 01:13:26,300
turn Stahl into a monster?

1080
01:13:26,380 --> 01:13:28,220
Let's go.
Just give me a minute.

1081
01:13:28,300 --> 01:13:31,060
We don't have a minute.
Then give me 10 seconds.

1082
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:35,100
This is its tongue.

1083
01:13:35,380 --> 01:13:37,740
This is brain matter
from Portman.

1084
01:13:38,740 --> 01:13:39,980
[hissing]

1085
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:44,460
This is from Destroyer.

1086
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:53,460
It's choosing, John.

1087
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:56,100
It's choosing who to infect.

1088
01:13:56,820 --> 01:13:58,580
It's choosing?
How is it choosing?

1089
01:13:58,660 --> 01:14:01,980
There are genetic markers
for psychotic
and violent behavior.

1090
01:14:02,780 --> 01:14:04,860
It could be a specific
neurotransmitter...

1091
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:06,980
it's picking up on,
a ganglion.

1092
01:14:07,300 --> 01:14:09,500
Latching onto numbers
in the DNA code linked to--

1093
01:14:09,540 --> 01:14:12,180
Linked to what? Evil?

1094
01:14:12,340 --> 01:14:14,780
Ten percent of the human
genome is still unmapped.

1095
01:14:14,860 --> 01:14:17,580
Some say it's the genetic
blueprint for the soul.

1096
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:21,020
Maybe C-24 is what destroyed
the population.

1097
01:14:21,860 --> 01:14:24,020
It would explain
why some of them
had to build the Ark...

1098
01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:25,900
to escape to a new beginning.

1099
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:30,180
Some it made superhuman.
Others, monsters.

1100
01:14:32,420 --> 01:14:33,500
Oh, my God.

1101
01:14:34,140 --> 01:14:35,700
We gotta get out of here now.
What?

1102
01:14:35,780 --> 01:14:37,700
Come on, let's go, come on.

1103
01:14:37,980 --> 01:14:39,900
The people quarantined on
the other side of the Ark...

1104
01:14:39,980 --> 01:14:41,260
they won't all be infected!

1105
01:14:41,340 --> 01:14:42,660
What's going on?

1106
01:14:43,660 --> 01:14:46,580
Sarge is going to
kill them all. Come on.

1107
01:14:48,700 --> 01:14:52,180
We uphold quarantine.
Nothing gets to the elevator
back on Earth.

1108
01:14:52,260 --> 01:14:54,180
We can't let them
get to the surface.

1109
01:14:54,260 --> 01:14:56,260
If it breathes, kill it.
(female computer voice)
Five...

1110
01:14:56,380 --> 01:14:58,700
four, three...

1111
01:14:59,140 --> 01:15:01,500
two, one.

1112
01:15:06,340 --> 01:15:07,620

Ark travel complete.

1114
01:15:12,380 --> 01:15:14,260
This is
Corporal Dean Portman...

1115
01:15:14,340 --> 01:15:17,340
with RRTS 6 Special Ops
on Olduvai, 0310 hours.

1116
01:15:18,380 --> 01:15:20,500
We have encountered
hostile activity.

1117
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:24,220
Require immediate
RRTS reinforcements.

1118
01:15:24,540 --> 01:15:26,020
Yeah, no shit.

1119
01:15:26,580 --> 01:15:29,620
We got 58 minutes before
the auto lockdown is lifted.

1120
01:15:30,100 --> 01:15:32,020
Reset it
for another six hours.

1121
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:33,860
(Duke)
I can't. It's been disabled.

1122
01:15:34,180 --> 01:15:35,980
Same as the topside comm link.

1123
01:15:36,060 --> 01:15:37,540
They're disabling
computers now?

1124
01:15:37,620 --> 01:15:39,740
Yeah,
they're rocket scientists,
remember?

1125
01:15:49,060 --> 01:15:50,180

(woman on PA)
Ark travel complete.

1129
01:16:49,820 --> 01:16:50,860
(John)
Oh, my God.

1130
01:16:53,260 --> 01:16:54,820
Sarge,
what's your position?

1131
01:16:57,780 --> 01:16:58,700
[screaming]

1132
01:17:06,140 --> 01:17:07,100
Sarge.

1133
01:17:07,220 --> 01:17:09,380
Sarge, come in.
Do you copy?

1134
01:17:09,620 --> 01:17:11,780
Come in, Sarge.
Do you read me? Over.

1135
01:17:11,860 --> 01:17:13,380
Sarge, come in,
do you copy?

1136
01:17:13,660 --> 01:17:15,100
Loud and clear.

1137
01:17:15,180 --> 01:17:16,540
(John on radio)
Look, do not kill everybody.

1138
01:17:16,620 --> 01:17:18,380
I repeat,
do not kill everybody.

1139
01:17:18,420 --> 01:17:19,700
Help me.
They're not all infected.

1140
01:17:19,780 --> 01:17:21,980
Help me, help me, please.
Do you copy?

1141
01:17:22,340 --> 01:17:24,500
Copy that.
(man)
Help me.

[gun firing]

1143
01:17:31,300 --> 01:17:34,620
Clear the rest of this sector
and meet back
at the Ark chamber.

(Pinky)
Jesus Christ,
what the hell are--

1146
01:17:56,500 --> 01:17:57,860
Who the hell's in there?

1147
01:17:59,340 --> 01:18:02,660
Well, don't just stand there,
you dumb son of a bitch.
Help me up.

1148
01:18:06,380 --> 01:18:07,700
[baby crying]

1149
01:18:08,380 --> 01:18:09,340
It's okay.

1150
01:18:19,420 --> 01:18:20,380
Please...

1151
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:22,940
help us.

1152
01:18:26,020 --> 01:18:28,100
(Samantha)
You don't have to
kill all of them.

1153
01:18:28,340 --> 01:18:32,820
I don't think everyone
is infected, or even capable
of being infected.

1154
01:18:34,380 --> 01:18:37,540
We have orders
to contain this threat
by any means necessary.

1155
01:18:37,620 --> 01:18:39,940
(John)
So let's evacuate
the uninfected...

1156
01:18:40,540 --> 01:18:41,900
and blow this place to hell.

1157
01:18:41,980 --> 01:18:43,820
And we have orders
to protect this facility.

1158
01:18:43,900 --> 01:18:45,980
We don't have orders
to kill innocent people.

1159
01:18:49,180 --> 01:18:52,020
(Sarge)
We have to stop anything
from getting to the surface...

1160
01:18:52,460 --> 01:18:54,740
by any means...

1161
01:18:55,300 --> 01:18:56,340
necessary.

1162
01:18:57,740 --> 01:19:00,220
Found this little chicken shit
hiding under a pile
of dead bodies.

1163
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:01,780
Am I glad to see you guys.

1164
01:19:01,860 --> 01:19:03,940
That thing
cut right through the door.

1165
01:19:04,020 --> 01:19:06,940
I tried to use the grenade
but it came at me too fast.

1166
01:19:07,660 --> 01:19:10,740
Followed me through the Ark
and started to kill everybody.

1167
01:19:11,420 --> 01:19:12,380
It was horrible.

1168
01:19:12,460 --> 01:19:15,740
There's no wound on his neck.
He's clean.

1169
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:20,820
I say who's clean...

1170
01:19:22,980 --> 01:19:24,380
and who's not.

1171
01:19:24,660 --> 01:19:26,740
[gun cocking]
I mean, it wasn't my fault.

1172
01:19:28,260 --> 01:19:30,420
Hey, I'm not a soldier.
You shouldn't have left me--

1173
01:19:30,460 --> 01:19:31,420
(Kid)
Sarge.

1174
01:19:34,140 --> 01:19:36,140
There's a storeroom
to the south.

1175
01:19:36,220 --> 01:19:38,540
It's got, like, 20 people
holed up inside of it.

1176
01:19:38,620 --> 01:19:40,140
We gotta do something.

1177
01:19:41,260 --> 01:19:43,420
Your orders were
to clear that sector.

1178
01:19:44,820 --> 01:19:46,020
Is it cleared?

1179
01:19:46,620 --> 01:19:48,380
No, I told them to stay put.

1180
01:19:49,300 --> 01:19:51,140
They're okay.
They're just scared shitless.

1181
01:19:51,580 --> 01:19:52,700
We kill them all.

1182
01:19:56,900 --> 01:19:58,420
Let God sort them out.

1183
01:19:59,980 --> 01:20:01,180
This is wrong.

1184
01:20:01,540 --> 01:20:03,620
I think--
Son, you don't think.

1185
01:20:06,020 --> 01:20:07,340
That's an order.

1186
01:20:09,180 --> 01:20:10,940
We're in the field, soldier.

1187
01:20:11,060 --> 01:20:12,700
Sarge,
if nothing's found them--

1188
01:20:12,740 --> 01:20:16,380
You will obey
the direct order...

1189
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:19,900
of your commanding officer.

1190
01:20:27,660 --> 01:20:28,740
No.

1191
01:20:31,580 --> 01:20:32,700
Now.

1192
01:20:34,700 --> 01:20:35,780
Go to hell.

1193
01:20:36,340 --> 01:20:37,580
[gun firing]
No!

1194
01:20:38,340 --> 01:20:39,820
No.
Holy shit.

1195
01:20:49,820 --> 01:20:53,300
(Sarge)
Mutinous insurrection
is punishable...

1196
01:20:54,780 --> 01:20:55,740
by death.

1197
01:21:00,060 --> 01:21:03,100
It was his first mission!
And it's not gonna be
my last.

1198
01:21:03,460 --> 01:21:04,860
(Sarge)
I need soldiers.

1199
01:21:05,620 --> 01:21:08,060
I don't need anybody else
but soldiers.

1200
01:21:41,940 --> 01:21:43,300
(Pinky)
Drop the weapons.

1201
01:21:43,660 --> 01:21:44,700
I mean it.

1202
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:48,620
I have no intention
of being killed by a madman.
Drop the weapons.

1203

[snarling]

Wait here.

1212
01:22:45,380 --> 01:22:46,340

Withdraw behind the nanowall.

I can't see. I can't see.

Clear.

1230
01:24:09,020 --> 01:24:11,020
How long
before they get through?

1231
01:24:12,580 --> 01:24:13,540
Not long.

1232
01:24:15,180 --> 01:24:16,620
(Samantha)
You've been hit.

1233
01:24:17,140 --> 01:24:18,340
Oh, John.

1234
01:24:33,140 --> 01:24:34,700
Listen to me, Sam.

You're cold. Shivering.

It's important.

This is an ST grenade.

1238

When they come through...

1239
01:24:49,020 --> 01:24:51,100
you pop the top
and hit the button.

1240
01:24:54,820 --> 01:24:57,140
John, stay with me.
Stay awake.

What's that?

It's C-24.
It's from Carmack's lab.
No.

1245
01:25:11,700 --> 01:25:14,340
It could save you.
No way, forget it.

1246
01:25:14,940 --> 01:25:16,580
You're bleeding to death.

1247

No way, Sam.

I've done some bad things.

one of those demons.

One through the heart,
one through the head...

don't you hesitate. Okay?
