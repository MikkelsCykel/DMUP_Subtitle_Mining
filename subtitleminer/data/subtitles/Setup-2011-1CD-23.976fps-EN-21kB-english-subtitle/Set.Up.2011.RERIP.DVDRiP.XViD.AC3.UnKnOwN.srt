When I was younger

00:01:01,642 --> 00:01:03,728
I wanted to be a priest.

4
00:01:03,895 --> 00:01:05,521
I was going into battle

5
00:01:05,688 --> 00:01:08,316
to save men's souls
from the evil of the world.

6
00:01:08,483 --> 00:01:10,234
But as I got older,

7
00:01:10,401 --> 00:01:12,737
I saw the world
for what it really was.

8
00:01:12,904 --> 00:01:15,531
It wasn't so much
who I was going to save,

9
00:01:15,698 --> 00:01:18,076
but who was gonna save
the world from me.

I mean really,
do you need all this?

I need them.

- Okay.
-( horn honks )

31
00:03:18,529 --> 00:03:21,073
Is the man of steel gonna finish taking
the boxes out of the garage or what?

32
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,451
- Okay.
- Ooh.

00:03:23,618 --> 00:03:25,536
I love you.

00:03:27,121 --> 00:03:29,624
I've got to go.
I love you.

00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:32,293
I've got to go.

00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,253
Hey.

37
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,755
Come home soon.

00:03:35,922 --> 00:03:38,382
Yeah.

39
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:40,635
Hey, Sonny.

40
00:03:40,801 --> 00:03:43,054
How are you doing?

41
00:03:47,808 --> 00:03:50,102
Boy: Hey Dave,
can you quarterback for us?

42
00:03:50,269 --> 00:03:51,520
Can't, man.
I've got to go.

43
00:03:54,815 --> 00:03:56,609
Yo, man, you just moved
in here a week ago.

44
00:03:56,776 --> 00:03:58,819
How the fuck does everybody
know your name already?

45
00:03:58,986 --> 00:04:01,197
- Why you always riding him?
- it's a gift.

46
00:04:01,364 --> 00:04:03,616
I'm blessed with an outstandingly
magnetic personality.

47
00:04:03,783 --> 00:04:05,576
Big fucking mouth
you mean.

48
00:04:05,743 --> 00:04:08,537
Okay, Mr. Antisocial. Next time
you're standing next to some chick

49
00:04:08,704 --> 00:04:10,873
trying to get laid, you're
gonna need my big mouth.

50
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,541
Yeah.

51
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:15,211
The day I need you
to help me get laid--

52
00:04:15,378 --> 00:04:17,838
I see the way
your woman looks at me.

Are you
eye-fucking me, boy?

00:05:07,346 --> 00:05:09,015
No, dog.

58
00:05:09,181 --> 00:05:12,268
My man in the warden's office says
they gonna be putting your ass

59
00:05:12,435 --> 00:05:15,813
back in general next week.
Then it's gonna be on, motherfucker.

60
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:18,858
Fuck you, nigger.
Anytime.

61
00:05:19,025 --> 00:05:21,569
You's a real tough
motherfucker now, huh?

62
00:05:21,736 --> 00:05:24,363
That's why they got your ass
over there in C-block.

63
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:27,199
That's where they keep all
the bitches and snitches.

64
00:05:28,784 --> 00:05:31,537
Which one you be?

( alarm ringing )

66
00:05:38,627 --> 00:05:41,297
Hey!

67
00:05:41,464 --> 00:05:43,716
You got something
to say now, nigger?

68
00:05:43,883 --> 00:05:47,136
Who's a bitch now,
you motherfucker?

69
00:05:47,303 --> 00:05:49,096
You want to run
your mouth now, nigger?

70
00:05:49,263 --> 00:05:52,099
Come on, I can't hear you.
Come on, motherfucker.

71
00:05:52,266 --> 00:05:54,352
Run your mouth.
I'll fuck you anytime, man.

72
00:05:54,518 --> 00:05:56,395
- Any fucking time.
- Guard: Shut up!

73
00:05:56,562 --> 00:05:58,481
Keep your mouth shut.
Keep your mouth shut.

74
00:05:58,647 --> 00:06:00,608
Hey, general population,
I'll see you there.

75
00:06:02,234 --> 00:06:04,320
Hey, you gonna nurse that bottle
or are you gonna drink it?

76
00:06:04,487 --> 00:06:05,988
What, you in a hurry, man?

77
00:06:06,155 --> 00:06:08,366
Pass that shit.
I need to warm up.

78
00:06:11,952 --> 00:06:14,830
I was just remembering
the first time

79
00:06:14,997 --> 00:06:16,832
Dave ever met my pop.

80
00:06:16,999 --> 00:06:19,210
Dude, I thought he was
gonna shit himself.

81
00:06:19,377 --> 00:06:20,795
You remember that?
You were stuttering.

82
00:06:20,961 --> 00:06:23,422
You were like, "N-n-n-nice
to meet you, s-sir."

83
00:06:23,589 --> 00:06:25,174
Fuck you.
Whatever, man.

84
00:06:25,341 --> 00:06:27,802
I don't blame you for being scared, man.
I've been scared of him too.

85
00:06:27,968 --> 00:06:29,887
Could be a mean old
son of a bitch.

86
00:06:30,054 --> 00:06:32,056
Nah, he was just all talk.

87
00:06:32,223 --> 00:06:34,892
All talk? That's all you've been
doing is talking.

88
00:06:35,059 --> 00:06:36,560
Start drinking.

89
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:45,069
- Man, it is cold up here.
- Dave: Fucking freezing.

90
00:06:45,236 --> 00:06:47,238
Dave:
Hey, man, hey.

91
00:06:47,405 --> 00:06:50,241
You know why I love
being up here, man?

92
00:06:50,408 --> 00:06:53,160
It's just like
being above it all, man.

93
00:06:53,327 --> 00:06:56,497
Like no problems pressing
down on my shoulders.

94
00:06:56,664 --> 00:06:58,582
Hey, like if you need counseling,
I've got you covered.

95
00:06:58,749 --> 00:07:00,918
- But can I have the bottle?
- Yeah, right.

96
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,132
Man, fuck
the holidays, dude.

97
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,679
Lighten up, man.

98
00:07:11,846 --> 00:07:14,890
Come on, bro, relax.
We love you, man.

99
00:07:15,057 --> 00:07:17,852
Come on, hug it out.
Rrr.

100
00:07:18,018 --> 00:07:20,354
Dude, get the fuck
off of me, man.

101
00:07:20,521 --> 00:07:22,690
( laughing )
I knew he wasn't going for that.

102

gotten into you, Vince?

137

Killing that guy
wasn't part of the plan.

Look at me when
I'm talking to you.

Nobody was
supposed to die, man.

He was fucking laying there.
I had the situation under control.

141
00:09:58,178 --> 00:10:00,347
You think I want that guy
out there looking for us

00:10:00,514 --> 00:10:02,516
trying to put
a bullet in my head?

Come on, man. The way I see it,
I was doing you a favor.

144
00:10:05,477 --> 00:10:08,522
A favor? Well, try not to do me
any more fucking favors, all right?

145
00:10:08,689 --> 00:10:10,316
Ladies, ladies.

146
00:10:10,482 --> 00:10:12,526
Look, no kissing
on the first date, okay?

147
00:10:12,693 --> 00:10:14,278
Dude, what does that--

148
00:10:14,445 --> 00:10:17,573
Look, I just--
what's done is done, okay?

149
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:21,118
- We've just got to stick together.
- Yeah.

150
00:10:22,911 --> 00:10:24,622
Stupid.

151
00:10:31,462 --> 00:10:33,589
- Where's your guy?
- He'll be here.

152
00:10:33,756 --> 00:10:35,966
You tell him we'd be down
here by the old truck depot?

153
00:10:36,133 --> 00:10:37,635
Yeah, I told him.

154
00:10:37,801 --> 00:10:41,388
- You say down by the river?
- The river, yeah.

155
00:10:45,309 --> 00:10:47,811
Come on now, we've been waiting
for this day for a long time.

156
00:10:47,978 --> 00:10:50,022
Let's not fucking fall apart.

157
00:10:51,357 --> 00:10:53,734
Yo, come check it out.

158
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,504
- Five milly.
- Whoo!

159
00:11:13,671 --> 00:11:17,174
Holy shit, that's a lot of ice, man.
Five million.

160
00:11:17,341 --> 00:11:20,636
See, now you see why i did
what i did, man. I got y'alls back.

161
00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:25,391
Here he comes.

162
00:11:31,105 --> 00:11:33,023
Why don't y'all wait here?

163
00:11:35,109 --> 00:11:36,860
Dave:
$5 million, man.

164
00:11:38,112 --> 00:11:40,280
I can take care of my girl.

165
00:11:40,447 --> 00:11:43,242
Sonny: That's all you think about.
Valerie this, Valerie that.

166
00:11:43,409 --> 00:11:45,869
- Dave: What do you want?
- I'm waiting on that money.

167
00:11:46,036 --> 00:11:48,622
- You okay?
- Yeah.

168
00:11:52,793 --> 00:11:55,587
You sure?

169
00:11:55,754 --> 00:11:58,006
Like I got a choice.

170
00:12:00,801 --> 00:12:02,845
- ( gunshot)
- Oh!

171
00:12:03,011 --> 00:12:05,556
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I'm sorry, bro.

172
00:12:05,723 --> 00:12:08,475
( gunshot )

173
00:12:09,893 --> 00:12:11,729
Let's go!
Let's go!

174
00:12:18,235 --> 00:12:20,571
Sonny's voice:
As I laid gasping for my next breath,

175
00:12:20,738 --> 00:12:23,157
I knew God had given me
a second chance.

176
00:12:23,323 --> 00:12:25,743
But I was too stupid
to take it.

177
00:12:25,909 --> 00:12:27,745
I was going to get
what was mine.

178
00:12:27,911 --> 00:12:29,288
( groans )

179
00:12:29,455 --> 00:12:31,123
Sonny, what the fuck?

180
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:32,332
- Fuck!
- He shot me.

181
00:12:32,499 --> 00:12:34,293
- Who shot you?
- Vince, man.

182
00:12:35,586 --> 00:12:38,213
Are you fucking kidding me?
Sit down.

183
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:42,217
- Where'd you get hit?
- Up top.

184
00:12:42,384 --> 00:12:44,470
Lay down.
Lay down.

185
00:12:45,763 --> 00:12:47,097
Oh fuck.

186
00:12:47,264 --> 00:12:49,224
It's lodged
in your collarbone.

187
00:12:53,604 --> 00:12:55,522
Get your fucking dirty hands
out of there. Let me have a look.

188
00:12:55,689 --> 00:12:59,026
You got lucky. Looks like
it hit your cross. Let me get this off.

189
00:12:59,193 --> 00:13:02,488
- My mom gave me that.
- Yeah, I know.

190
00:13:02,654 --> 00:13:04,990
Hold on, you're gonna
need this. Here.

191
00:13:05,157 --> 00:13:08,118
'Cause this is gonna
pucker your asshole.

192
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:13,916
Move this.
Ready?

193
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:18,045
Oh shit.

194
00:13:18,212 --> 00:13:19,963
It ain't even that deep.

195
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:21,715
It's fucking burning, man.

196
00:13:23,217 --> 00:13:24,968
I heard something
was gonna go down.

197
00:13:25,135 --> 00:13:26,553
I didn't think
it was you guys.

198
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,013
What did you hear, Joe?

199
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,891
Come on, let me finish
this shit, all right?

200
00:13:31,058 --> 00:13:33,769
Ahh! Shit!

201
00:13:33,936 --> 00:13:35,437
Fuck, it's in there.
Hold on.

202
00:13:35,604 --> 00:13:38,690
I see the shit.
I feel it.

203
00:13:38,857 --> 00:13:40,776
(groaning )

204
00:13:40,943 --> 00:13:42,945
Oh Shit. Shit.

205
00:13:43,111 --> 00:13:44,655
Hold on, hold on.

206
00:13:44,822 --> 00:13:46,824
Oh fuck.

207
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:50,786
Nice, huh? I'll make
a nice tongue stud with that.

208
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:59,044
I can't believe he shot me, man.
What'd you hear, Joey?

209
00:13:59,211 --> 00:14:01,296
Vince was running his mouth

210
00:14:01,463 --> 00:14:04,132
to some connected guys downtown
that he's got a big score coming.

211
00:14:04,299 --> 00:14:06,301
Why would he say that?
We never kick back to them.

212
00:14:06,468 --> 00:14:09,304
I don't know. I think he was just
trying to buy some protection.

213
00:14:12,766 --> 00:14:14,768
Hold that there. Hold that.

214
00:14:22,025 --> 00:14:24,194
Where the fuck are you going?
You need to lay down.

215
00:14:24,361 --> 00:14:26,029
- I got to find him.
- Oh, yeah, genius?

216
00:14:26,196 --> 00:14:28,740
You gonna be walking around in
a bloody shirt with a bullet hole in it?

217
00:14:28,907 --> 00:14:31,034
Cops won't be looking for that.
Take that shit off.

218
00:14:31,201 --> 00:14:33,203
Here.

219
00:14:35,205 --> 00:14:39,710
- Listen, you know John R, right?
- Yeah, made guy, runs the card clubs.

220
00:14:39,877 --> 00:14:41,920
Yeah, down on Woodward.
Now I'll bet

221
00:14:42,087 --> 00:14:44,339
if someone was to go
down there this Friday night,

222
00:14:44,506 --> 00:14:48,594
he might run into Vince or someone
who knows where he is.

223
00:14:50,053 --> 00:14:52,931
- Thanks, Joey.
- Hey, hold on.

224
00:14:54,892 --> 00:14:56,810
Try not to get
your ass shot again, all right?

225
00:14:59,021 --> 00:15:00,564
You need anything,
you come back here.

226
00:15:00,731 --> 00:15:03,025
- All right?
- All right.

227
00:15:03,191 --> 00:15:05,736
(church bells ringing )

228
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:35,599
Do you want to talk about it?

229
00:15:35,766 --> 00:15:37,935
Talk about what?

230
00:15:38,101 --> 00:15:40,103
Whatever brought you here.

231
00:15:42,189 --> 00:15:44,358
I'm here to pray for a friend.

232
00:15:44,524 --> 00:15:45,776
Ah.

233
00:15:45,943 --> 00:15:47,819
Is he sick?

234
00:15:47,986 --> 00:15:50,906
No. He's dead.

235
00:15:52,574 --> 00:15:54,451
Forgive me for asking.

236
00:15:54,618 --> 00:15:56,870
Were you close?

237
00:15:57,037 --> 00:15:58,789
Yeah.

238
00:15:58,956 --> 00:16:00,958
We were like brothers.

239
00:16:01,124 --> 00:16:05,504
Then rest assured
he is in a better place now.

240
00:16:06,755 --> 00:16:10,050
How do you know?
You ever been dead before?

241
00:16:14,805 --> 00:16:17,891
There are many paths
to God, my son.

242
00:16:18,058 --> 00:16:21,520
I pray that yours
will not be too difficult.

243
00:16:36,284 --> 00:16:38,495
- There you are.
- Thank you, sir.

244
00:16:52,009 --> 00:16:54,177
Hey, beautiful lines.

245
00:16:54,344 --> 00:16:56,096
Yeah.

246
00:16:56,263 --> 00:16:59,558
I guess $5 million will buy you
a lot of things like that, huh?

247
00:17:01,727 --> 00:17:04,938
You see, my friend, I think we are
both looking for the same thing.

248
00:17:05,105 --> 00:17:07,607
I'm not your friend
and I'm not looking for anything.

249
00:17:07,774 --> 00:17:11,820
Okay, so let's cut
the bullshit, shall we?

250
00:17:11,987 --> 00:17:15,699
You took something from us
and we want it back.

251
00:17:15,866 --> 00:17:19,286
And I'm the guy
they picked to get it back.

252
00:17:19,453 --> 00:17:23,749
However, if you help us,

253
00:17:23,915 --> 00:17:26,585
we are willing to overlook
your part in it.

254
00:17:26,752 --> 00:17:29,880
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

255
00:17:30,047 --> 00:17:33,383
Hey, come on. It only took me
two days to find you.

256
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:36,762
And if I get those stones
without your help,

257
00:17:36,928 --> 00:17:39,848
we are going to meet again.

258
00:17:40,015 --> 00:17:44,227
Except this time you won't
even hear the hammer drop.

259
00:17:44,394 --> 00:17:46,938
Are we clear?

260
00:17:47,105 --> 00:17:49,524
Look, if it was up to my friends

261
00:17:49,691 --> 00:17:51,276
you'd be dead already.

262
00:17:51,443 --> 00:17:54,905
But I'm a patient man.

263
00:17:56,656 --> 00:17:59,910
You've got one week, huh?

264
00:18:00,077 --> 00:18:02,954
It was very nice meeting you.

265
00:18:05,749 --> 00:18:07,959
Oh, hey, ladies.
How's it going?

266
00:18:08,126 --> 00:18:10,378
What you guys up to tonight?

267
00:18:10,545 --> 00:18:13,590
Oh come on,
don't be like that.

268
00:18:13,757 --> 00:18:15,634
Could you get that door
for me, big man?

269
00:18:15,801 --> 00:18:17,427
Sure, no problem.

270
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,683
Why don't you stop playing
like such a fucking nit?

271
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:26,978
- I'm out.
- Shut your trap, you fuck stick.

272
00:18:27,145 --> 00:18:28,772
In fact, take that.

273
00:18:30,774 --> 00:18:32,275
Put your hands
where I can see 'em.

274
00:18:32,442 --> 00:18:35,779
- Are you robbing us?
- Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

275
00:18:35,946 --> 00:18:37,948
Who the fuck do you think
you're talking to?

276
00:18:38,115 --> 00:18:39,491
(grunts)

277
00:18:39,658 --> 00:18:41,284
All right, now let's start over.

278
00:18:41,451 --> 00:18:44,037
Okay, what can we do for you?

279
00:18:44,204 --> 00:18:46,623
Now we're getting somewhere.
I'm looking for Vincent Long.

280
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:48,667
- Anybody seen him?
- No.

281
00:18:48,834 --> 00:18:50,210
Of course
everyone's got amnesia.

282
00:18:50,377 --> 00:18:52,003
But if you get
your memory back,

283
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:54,381
tell him an old friend is
looking for him, all right?

284
00:18:57,509 --> 00:18:59,427
And now I'm robbing you.

285
00:18:59,594 --> 00:19:01,847
- What the fuck are you looking at?
- Nothing.

286
00:19:19,447 --> 00:19:21,408
- How's everything over here?
- Very good.

287
00:19:21,575 --> 00:19:23,368
Okay? Good.

288
00:19:23,535 --> 00:19:26,163
- All done?
- Yeah, I'm finished.

289
00:19:26,329 --> 00:19:29,082
- I just need the check, please.
- Okay.

290
00:19:34,129 --> 00:19:37,549
Here you go.

291
00:19:37,716 --> 00:19:39,968
Slow night tonight, huh?

292
00:19:40,135 --> 00:19:42,679
Yeah well, it pays the bills.

293
00:19:42,846 --> 00:19:45,640
I'm really a singer. I'm not
gonna be here much longer.

294
00:19:45,807 --> 00:19:47,684
And why is that?

295
00:19:47,851 --> 00:19:49,561
Well, I pray every night

296
00:19:49,728 --> 00:19:51,438
that God gets me
a record contract.

297
00:19:51,605 --> 00:19:54,024
- Does He hear you?
- Of course He does.

298
00:19:55,192 --> 00:19:56,902
I just have to wait my turn.

299
00:19:58,904 --> 00:20:00,822
No no, that's for you.

300
00:20:00,989 --> 00:20:03,867
Thank you.

301
00:20:04,034 --> 00:20:05,869
Good things are coming
to you too.

302
00:20:06,036 --> 00:20:07,579
- I promise.
-( laughs )

303
00:20:07,746 --> 00:20:09,456
Happy holidays.

304
00:20:16,087 --> 00:20:18,131
(grunts)

305
00:20:26,056 --> 00:20:27,349
You with me?

306
00:20:27,515 --> 00:20:30,727
- You got a name?
- Sonny.

307
00:20:30,894 --> 00:20:33,563
Like in "O what a sunny
fucking day we're having?"

308
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:35,315
Fuck you.
Who are you?

309
00:20:35,482 --> 00:20:37,817
All right, Sonny.
Sleepy-time.

310
00:20:44,199 --> 00:20:46,660
Are you out
of your fucking mind?

311
00:20:46,826 --> 00:20:49,037
Are you?

312
00:20:50,872 --> 00:20:53,416
I'm looking for my so-called friend.
He shot me.

313
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:56,753
- I'm gonna find him.
- So you can shoot him?

314
00:21:00,257 --> 00:21:02,884
Are you retarded?
Are you handicapped?

315
00:21:03,051 --> 00:21:05,679
You think you're gonna
come into my town

316
00:21:05,845 --> 00:21:08,181
and take down poker games,

317
00:21:08,348 --> 00:21:10,809
shoot whoever you want
without my permission?

318
00:21:10,976 --> 00:21:13,144
Are you done
with your speech?

319
00:21:16,314 --> 00:21:18,316
Take it easy, Petey.

320
00:21:22,779 --> 00:21:25,115
What's the name
of the kid that shot you?

321
00:21:25,282 --> 00:21:28,868
Vincent. Vincent Long.

322
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:33,123
Vincent Long that runs
with John R's crew?

323
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:35,125
Yeah, he's been hanging around.

324
00:21:36,418 --> 00:21:38,003
Congratulations.

325
00:21:38,169 --> 00:21:40,672
You managed to piss off
a very important group of people

326
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:43,758
that I make money with.
That means you owe me now.

327
00:21:43,925 --> 00:21:46,511
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that's right.

328
00:21:46,678 --> 00:21:49,097
Every fucking thing
I say is right.

329
00:21:52,392 --> 00:21:54,144
But I'm a fair guy.

330
00:21:54,311 --> 00:21:56,396
You help me out with my problem

331
00:21:56,563 --> 00:21:58,398
and I can help you out
with your problem.

332
00:21:58,565 --> 00:22:00,275
I'm listening.

333
00:22:00,442 --> 00:22:04,237
I used to know a guy,
laundered money for the Russians.

334
00:22:06,323 --> 00:22:09,367
But he had a funny way
of counting.

335
00:22:09,534 --> 00:22:12,537
For every $3 he laundered
he kept $1 for himself.

336
00:22:12,704 --> 00:22:15,957
Accumulated quite
a stack of dollars.

337
00:22:16,124 --> 00:22:18,084
$2 million.

338
00:22:18,251 --> 00:22:20,712
Only problem is the Russians
found out about it

339
00:22:20,879 --> 00:22:23,256
and chopped both his legs
off with a axe.

340
00:22:23,423 --> 00:22:25,425
But they never found the money.

341
00:22:25,592 --> 00:22:27,635
His family buried it with him.

342
00:22:27,802 --> 00:22:30,513
Well, I ain't digging up
no motherfucking dead body.

343
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,433
Shut the fuck up.

344
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,186
I don't want you to dig
anyone up.

345
00:22:38,021 --> 00:22:39,647
The Russians found out
where the money is.

346
00:22:39,814 --> 00:22:42,067
They're gonna take it
out of the ground tonight

347
00:22:42,233 --> 00:22:43,777
and you're gonna take it
from them.

348
00:22:43,943 --> 00:22:45,111
What's in it for me?

349
00:22:45,278 --> 00:22:49,240
Very few men know the exact
value of their life.

350
00:22:49,407 --> 00:22:51,576
Now you know
what yours is worth.

351
00:22:51,743 --> 00:22:53,870
$2 million.

352
00:22:54,037 --> 00:22:56,456
And just to make sure
you bring that money to me,

353
00:22:56,623 --> 00:22:58,500
I'm gonna send Petey
along with you.

354
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,838
Get out of here.

355
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,222
Okay, there they are.

356
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:19,771
Kick back, relax.
We'll let them dig it up.

357
00:23:19,938 --> 00:23:22,524
( exhales )

358
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:24,776
Hey, you got a plan?

359
00:23:24,943 --> 00:23:27,529
A plan? Oh yeah,
the plan's real complicated.

360
00:23:27,695 --> 00:23:29,406
You're gonna sneak
your ass down there

361
00:23:29,572 --> 00:23:31,991
and shoot those motherfuckers
in the head and grab the money.

362
00:23:32,158 --> 00:23:34,536
Then you're gonna run your ass
back up here like a crack nigger

363
00:23:34,702 --> 00:23:36,788
at a police funeral.
You down with that, homie?

364
00:23:36,955 --> 00:23:38,248
And where you gonna be at?

365
00:23:38,415 --> 00:23:40,834
Oh, close enough to shoot you
in the head if you fuck up.

366
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,420
What's to stop you from shooting me
after I bring you the money?

367
00:23:43,586 --> 00:23:46,423
That's what we call
a calculated risk.

368
00:23:46,589 --> 00:23:48,466
Ssst

369
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:51,886
Petey:
All right, they got it.

370
00:23:52,053 --> 00:23:54,514
- Let's go. Go get it.
- Shit.

371
00:24:13,366 --> 00:24:14,784
(grunts)

372
00:24:24,377 --> 00:24:25,503
Get down.

373
00:24:30,425 --> 00:24:33,845
(mumbling quietly)

374
00:24:53,156 --> 00:24:54,991
Got it.

375
00:24:57,327 --> 00:24:59,537
I get your $2 million
and you're still gonna shoot me?

376
00:24:59,704 --> 00:25:01,456
No.

377
00:25:01,623 --> 00:25:05,168
But I can't watch you
and drive this car at the same time.

378
00:25:05,335 --> 00:25:06,544
I need that other gun.

379
00:25:11,508 --> 00:25:13,384
Thanks, Sonny.
You're all right.

380
00:25:13,551 --> 00:25:15,678
You've got some balls.

381
00:25:15,845 --> 00:25:19,390
You don't have to worry
about your problem now.

382
00:25:19,557 --> 00:25:21,351
Mr. Biggs is a man of his word.

383
00:25:21,518 --> 00:25:23,520
I know you two got off
on the wrong foot.

384
00:25:23,686 --> 00:25:27,398
Hey, you did the job,
we've got his cash.

385
00:25:27,565 --> 00:25:29,317
Shit, let's celebrate.

386
00:25:29,484 --> 00:25:31,152
Know anyplace
where we can get a bag?

387
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:34,948
I know a few people.
Let me make some phone calls.

388
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:37,992
Make it happen.

389
00:25:46,709 --> 00:25:48,836
Hey, what's up? It's Sonny.

390
00:25:49,003 --> 00:25:51,047
Yeah yeah yeah, I know.

391
00:25:51,214 --> 00:25:54,551
Hey, I want to stop by there.
You know, got to get a little something.

392
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:58,680
All right. All right, cool.

393
00:26:14,946 --> 00:26:17,115
You're just gonna leave
the money in the trunk?

394
00:26:17,282 --> 00:26:18,741
Yeah, why not?

395
00:26:18,908 --> 00:26:21,119
Who the fuck's gonna know
I got $2 million in my car?

396
00:26:26,374 --> 00:26:28,251
( knocks )

397
00:26:31,087 --> 00:26:32,422
( knocks )

398
00:26:32,589 --> 00:26:35,633
- ( gunshots on game )
-( knocking )

399
00:26:44,058 --> 00:26:45,518
About time
you showed up, man.

400
00:26:45,685 --> 00:26:47,186
Come on, man.

401
00:26:47,353 --> 00:26:48,563
Who this?

402
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:50,607
G, Petey; Petey, G.

403
00:26:50,773 --> 00:26:52,191
Is he a cop?

404
00:26:52,358 --> 00:26:54,569
Come on, why you gonna
ask me some shit like that?

405
00:26:54,736 --> 00:26:56,446
Shit, nigga, I had to ask.

406
00:26:56,613 --> 00:26:58,781
Y'all come on in.

407
00:27:01,576 --> 00:27:03,369
Damn.

408
00:27:07,206 --> 00:27:09,250
Hey man, the war is over.
Didn't you hear?

409
00:27:09,417 --> 00:27:11,544
Depends on which war
you're talking about.

410
00:27:11,711 --> 00:27:13,838
How much you need?

411
00:27:22,096 --> 00:27:24,849
Oh yeah.
I can handle that.

412
00:27:29,562 --> 00:27:31,606
G Money:
So how you been, Sonny?

413
00:27:31,773 --> 00:27:34,484
Sonny:
Hey, surviving.

414
00:27:34,651 --> 00:27:36,653
What's up
with this motherfucker, man?

415
00:27:36,819 --> 00:27:40,448
- That's business.
- Yeah, I can dig it.

416
00:27:47,205 --> 00:27:49,040
( laughs )

417
00:27:49,207 --> 00:27:51,000
I can smell that weed
from over here, man.

418
00:27:51,167 --> 00:27:52,710
Ooh, this is that fire.

419
00:27:52,877 --> 00:27:54,837
Now we call this
that snake weed.

420
00:27:55,004 --> 00:27:57,548
Got a partner, man,
he runs an exotic pet store--

421
00:28:00,134 --> 00:28:01,928
Hey, motherfucker.
What are you doing?

422
00:28:02,095 --> 00:28:03,513
This ain't goddamn
"Duck Hunt."

423
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,932
Relax. I can handle
a fucking gun.

424
00:28:06,099 --> 00:28:07,517
I'm quite sure
you can handle a gun.

425
00:28:07,684 --> 00:28:09,811
But I just spent $2,000
getting them triggers dialed up.

426
00:28:12,689 --> 00:28:14,190
He's your boy, huh?

427
00:28:25,368 --> 00:28:29,747
Anyway, man, he puts the weed
inside of boa constrictors.

428
00:28:29,914 --> 00:28:32,500
- And customs don't check it?
- There ain't nobody dumb enough

429
00:28:32,667 --> 00:28:34,293
to put their hand down
no goddamn snake's throat.

430
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:37,213
( laughs )
They're too cheap for the X-rays.

431
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,549
So they just wave them
motherfuckers on through.

432
00:28:39,716 --> 00:28:41,843
- ( gunshot )
- Holy shit!

433
00:28:42,009 --> 00:28:44,721
- Oh shit.
- This is bad, man.

434
00:28:44,887 --> 00:28:46,389
- Get a towel.
- What?

435
00:28:46,556 --> 00:28:47,724
- Get a towel.
- Why, man?

436
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:49,308
This motherfucker's dead.

437
00:28:49,475 --> 00:28:52,103
- The fucking guns is loaded?
- Man, do you keep a car in the garage

438
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:54,605
without no gas in it?
You heard me, right?

439
00:28:54,772 --> 00:28:56,983
I told this motherfucker.
I said do not touch the guns.

440
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:59,736
But he wanted to be the goddamn
Lone Ranger and start fucking with shit.

441
00:28:59,902 --> 00:29:01,070
I am not going down
for this shit.

442
00:29:01,237 --> 00:29:02,405
Get me something
to wrap him up in.

443
00:29:02,572 --> 00:29:04,323
I got two strikes.
This ain't gonna be my third.

444
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:07,118
- Get me something to wrap him up in.
- Shit, where are we gonna take him?

445
00:29:07,285 --> 00:29:08,578
- I know a guy.
- Is he far?

446
00:29:08,745 --> 00:29:10,204
Motherfucker, you got
something better to do?

447
00:29:10,371 --> 00:29:12,081
No no no. You're right.

448
00:29:13,666 --> 00:29:15,918
- Shit.
- Okay.

449
00:29:16,085 --> 00:29:18,254
Okay. Man, you ought
to ashamed of yourself

450
00:29:18,421 --> 00:29:20,506
bringing this crazy white man
to my motherfucking house.

451
00:29:20,673 --> 00:29:23,301
- You know that?
- Help me turn him over.

452
00:29:23,468 --> 00:29:25,219
- Oh shit.
- Oh shit.

453
00:29:25,386 --> 00:29:27,263
- All right.
- Help me pick him up.

454
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:29,098
I ain't fucking with you
no more, Sonny.

455
00:29:29,265 --> 00:29:32,643
I am not fucking with you no more.
One, two, three.

456
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:34,103
( both groan )

457
00:29:35,605 --> 00:29:37,231
- Oh.
- Oh shit.

458
00:29:37,398 --> 00:29:38,941
Damn.

459
00:29:39,108 --> 00:29:41,486
All right, all right.
Hold on. All right.

460
00:29:44,113 --> 00:29:46,365
What the hell were you
feeding this man?

461
00:29:52,455 --> 00:29:54,040
Right, where are the keys?

462
00:29:54,207 --> 00:29:55,708
He's got the keys.

463
00:29:55,875 --> 00:29:58,127
He got the keys?

464
00:29:59,712 --> 00:30:01,422
Well, you get 'em.
I ain't touching him.

465
00:30:09,263 --> 00:30:10,973
Getting my gun.

466
00:30:12,308 --> 00:30:14,727
Don't shoot your dick off,
motherfucker.

467
00:30:26,489 --> 00:30:28,866
Okay.

468
00:30:34,831 --> 00:30:37,625
G Money: You know I got
some nosy-ass neighbors.

469
00:30:41,254 --> 00:30:43,172
All right.

470
00:30:45,925 --> 00:30:47,134
Hey, Sonny man.

471
00:30:47,301 --> 00:30:49,178
Look, bro, you're my boy.
All right?

472
00:30:49,345 --> 00:30:52,849
Love you, man. But don't come
around here no more, all right?

473
00:30:53,015 --> 00:30:55,309
Bad for business, man.

474
00:31:16,664 --> 00:31:18,958
Hey, you're early.

475
00:31:19,125 --> 00:31:20,710
The suits are still here.

476
00:31:20,877 --> 00:31:22,753
- Come around the side in a mo.
- Okay.

477
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,256
All right?

478
00:31:25,423 --> 00:31:28,509
Grab his legs.

479
00:31:28,676 --> 00:31:30,803
Help me get him undressed.

480
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:32,597
He's a big boy, isn't he?

481
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:38,811
What are we gonna
do with his clothes?

482
00:31:38,978 --> 00:31:40,688
Oh, there's a furnace
in the back.

483
00:31:50,823 --> 00:31:52,909
( fabric ripping )

484
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:55,745
Hmm.

485
00:31:55,912 --> 00:31:58,122
All right.

486
00:32:00,833 --> 00:32:02,585
All right.

487
00:32:10,718 --> 00:32:13,471
( sawing )

488
00:32:13,638 --> 00:32:16,724
( breathing heavily )

489
00:32:16,891 --> 00:32:19,226
(giggling )

490
00:32:30,029 --> 00:32:32,406
Yeah, bring the bin
a bit closer.

491
00:32:35,952 --> 00:32:37,787
There we go.

492
00:32:43,125 --> 00:32:46,045
Right.

493
00:32:46,212 --> 00:32:48,756
Did you know there's 207 bones
in the human body?

494
00:32:48,923 --> 00:32:52,385
And 27 of those are in the cranium.

495
00:32:52,551 --> 00:32:55,596
Now the average cranial capacity

496
00:32:55,763 --> 00:32:58,015
of modern man-- hit it, would you?

497
00:32:58,182 --> 00:33:00,476
--is 1200cc.

498
00:33:00,643 --> 00:33:03,479
And the average cranial capacity

499
00:33:03,646 --> 00:33:05,106
of Neanderthal man

500
00:33:05,272 --> 00:33:07,274
is 1800cc.

501
00:33:07,441 --> 00:33:09,652
I was just thinking
how fascinating

502
00:33:09,819 --> 00:33:12,863
that a creature that we think
is a primitive caveman

503
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:16,242
actually had 27% more brains

504
00:33:16,409 --> 00:33:18,995
than anyone alive today.

505
00:33:19,161 --> 00:33:21,664
Sonny's voice: As I listened
to the butcher rambling on

506
00:33:21,831 --> 00:33:24,500
it hit me--
Vince set up the score.

507
00:33:24,667 --> 00:33:26,544
So the driver must have
been in on it.

508
00:33:26,711 --> 00:33:29,839
If I found her,
I'd be that much closer to him.

509
00:33:30,006 --> 00:33:31,882
As for Petey, well...

510
00:33:32,049 --> 00:33:35,594
let's just say there's a reason
I'll never eat a hamburger again.

511
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,554
( car starts )

512
00:34:46,499 --> 00:34:48,000
Drive around the block.

513
00:34:48,167 --> 00:34:50,795
( gasps )
Okay.

514
00:34:50,961 --> 00:34:53,672
Okay. Okay, please.

515
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:56,133
( whimpers )

516
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,677
Please take it easy.

517
00:35:00,429 --> 00:35:02,223
This is far enough.
Pull over.

518
00:35:03,349 --> 00:35:05,601
Please don't hurt me.

519
00:35:05,768 --> 00:35:08,104
Shut it off.

520
00:35:09,605 --> 00:35:11,690
- Okay.
- What's your name?

521
00:35:11,857 --> 00:35:14,527
Mia.

522
00:35:14,693 --> 00:35:16,570
You recognize me?

523
00:35:18,405 --> 00:35:21,367
No, I'm sorry.
I don't. Should I?

524
00:35:21,534 --> 00:35:24,703
An Iranian diamond broker got jacked
on the corner of 6th and Santa Fe.

525
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:27,373
( breathes heavily )

526
00:35:28,916 --> 00:35:30,292
Yeah, that's right.

527
00:35:30,459 --> 00:35:32,086
I didn't get my share.
Where is he?

528
00:35:32,253 --> 00:35:35,965
The blonde guy? I swear
I have not seen him since then.

529
00:35:36,132 --> 00:35:38,259
L-- I met him
through some friends.

530
00:35:38,425 --> 00:35:41,637
He offered me $5,000
to take this guy to a spot.

531
00:35:41,804 --> 00:35:43,305
- Bullshit.
- No no no no.

532
00:35:43,472 --> 00:35:45,015
I swear to God.
(crying )

533
00:35:45,182 --> 00:35:47,643
I'm telling you the truth.
You have to believe me.

534
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:50,271
I did not know that my client
was gonna get hurt.

535
00:35:50,437 --> 00:35:53,190
He promised me that
that wasn't going to happen.

536
00:35:53,357 --> 00:35:56,485
I swear to God I'm telling you
the truth. You have to believe me.

537
00:35:56,652 --> 00:35:58,821
Please, believe me.

538
00:35:58,988 --> 00:36:01,240
- Mia.
- Yes?

539
00:36:01,407 --> 00:36:04,535
For your sake I hope
you're telling the truth.

540
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:13,794
Oh God.

541
00:37:33,123 --> 00:37:35,334
Gotcha.

542
00:38:36,312 --> 00:38:38,105
Whoa whoa whoa
whoa whoa.

543
00:38:38,272 --> 00:38:40,316
There's no money
in the house.

544
00:38:40,482 --> 00:38:41,817
Vincent Long, you know him?

545
00:38:41,984 --> 00:38:44,653
No, I've never heard of him.

546
00:38:47,614 --> 00:38:49,700
Okay, yeah, I know him.

547
00:38:49,867 --> 00:38:52,202
Sit your ass down.

548
00:38:58,542 --> 00:39:00,002
Let's start with who you are.

549
00:39:00,169 --> 00:39:02,463
I'm Russell.

550
00:39:02,629 --> 00:39:05,799
I work for
the diamond exchange.

551
00:39:05,966 --> 00:39:09,511
Your friend came to me, asked me if
I could move $5 million in uncut stones.

552
00:39:09,678 --> 00:39:11,430
He brought 'em, I paid him.

553
00:39:11,597 --> 00:39:13,390
Done deal.
Everybody got their share.

554
00:39:13,557 --> 00:39:14,892
Not everybody.

555
00:39:15,059 --> 00:39:17,394
Well, obviously.

556
00:39:17,561 --> 00:39:20,147
- What's the girl's angle?
- Mia?

557
00:39:20,314 --> 00:39:21,857
She's my girlfriend.

558
00:39:22,024 --> 00:39:24,234
We needed a driver
who wouldn't freak out.

559
00:39:24,401 --> 00:39:26,945
So we planted her
at the car service.

560
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,616
Look, I can't help you.

561
00:39:30,783 --> 00:39:33,827
I move diamonds.
That's all I do.

562
00:39:33,994 --> 00:39:35,996
People don't get their share,
some guy gets clipped,

563
00:39:36,163 --> 00:39:38,082
it's not my fucking problem.
Hey, whoa, hey!

564
00:39:38,248 --> 00:39:40,334
- Dave Hall.
- What?

565
00:39:40,501 --> 00:39:43,837
Say it, Dave Hall.
Say it, God damn it.

566
00:39:44,004 --> 00:39:45,756
- Dave Hall.
- Dave Hall! Dave Hall.

567
00:39:45,923 --> 00:39:47,633
That wasn't just
anybody who got clipped.

568
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,302
That was my long-time
friend Dave Hall.

569
00:39:51,929 --> 00:39:54,640
Hey hey, I can help you
get Vince.

570
00:39:54,807 --> 00:39:57,184
- Yeah?
- Yeah, it won't be easy.

571
00:39:57,351 --> 00:40:00,229
He's got a place
he hangs out over on 3rd.

572
00:40:00,396 --> 00:40:03,941
Couple of guys, tough--
real stone killers.

573
00:40:06,402 --> 00:40:08,529
Now when you see him
you to give him a message.

574
00:40:08,695 --> 00:40:11,490
Tell him his old friend from high school
is looking for him.

575
00:40:19,873 --> 00:40:22,292
Oh, you're kidding me.
You're kidding me, right?

576
00:40:22,459 --> 00:40:24,420
Really?

577
00:40:24,586 --> 00:40:27,005
- Put your arms down. Come around here.
- Unbelievable.

578
00:40:27,172 --> 00:40:29,258
So what are you gonna
do about this guy?

579
00:40:30,968 --> 00:40:34,388
What, no hello?
That's fucking rude.

580
00:40:34,555 --> 00:40:37,391
Oh, I'm sorry. Hello.

581
00:40:37,558 --> 00:40:39,935
Now what the fuck are you
gonna do about this guy?

582
00:40:40,102 --> 00:40:42,479
He came to my house
last night, Vince.

583
00:40:42,646 --> 00:40:44,231
My house.

584
00:40:44,398 --> 00:40:47,109
This is your fuck up.
This was your end of the deal.

585
00:40:47,276 --> 00:40:48,944
- My end?
- Yes.

586
00:40:49,111 --> 00:40:51,822
Now take care of it.

587
00:40:51,989 --> 00:40:53,740
What did you tell him?

588
00:40:53,907 --> 00:40:54,950
What do you mean?

589
00:40:55,117 --> 00:40:57,953
I mean what
did you tell him?

590
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,539
Uh, how about not a goddamn thing?
What are you talking about?

591
00:41:00,706 --> 00:41:03,292
Russell, I know how weak you are,
so just tell me what you told him.

592
00:41:03,459 --> 00:41:05,335
I didn't-- I didn't say--
I didn't say anything.

593
00:41:05,502 --> 00:41:08,130
You're still alive.

594
00:41:08,297 --> 00:41:10,132
That means you
told him something.

595
00:41:10,299 --> 00:41:12,468
Now I want to know
what the fuck it was.

596
00:41:12,634 --> 00:41:15,012
Okay, you know what?
Yes.

597
00:41:15,179 --> 00:41:18,223
I told you
from the beginning

598
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:20,601
there could be
no loose ends, Vince.

599
00:41:20,767 --> 00:41:23,020
You needed money.
I told you how to get it.

600
00:41:23,187 --> 00:41:25,314
Somewhere along the line
you fucked up.

601
00:41:25,481 --> 00:41:28,650
These were your friends.
You should have handled it.

602
00:41:28,817 --> 00:41:30,819
( choking )

603
00:41:39,953 --> 00:41:42,080
Get that shit
out of here, Markus.

604
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,838
I-I can't believe
we're related.

605
00:41:50,005 --> 00:41:53,675
I fucked this guy for months
to make this deal happen.

606
00:41:53,842 --> 00:41:56,637
I never did like
the idea of you fucking him.

607
00:41:56,803 --> 00:41:59,640
You know what
we had to do, Vince.

608
00:41:59,806 --> 00:42:01,266
Now what about Sonny?

609
00:42:01,433 --> 00:42:03,727
I'm gonna handle it.

610
00:42:03,894 --> 00:42:05,103
( scoffs )

611
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:07,397
How did he look?

612
00:42:07,564 --> 00:42:10,359
How the fuck do you think he looked?
He looked pissed off.

613
00:42:10,526 --> 00:42:13,028
I hope you know
what you're doing, Vince.

614
00:42:17,074 --> 00:42:19,952
( clock chiming )

615
00:42:22,871 --> 00:42:25,290
- Mr. B.
- Yeah, Tony?

616
00:42:30,295 --> 00:42:31,880
( sighs )

617
00:42:32,047 --> 00:42:34,258
You know, one of the greatest
pleasures of my life

618
00:42:34,424 --> 00:42:38,136
is eating my breakfast
and reading the sports page.

619
00:42:39,555 --> 00:42:41,223
I like reading the box scores.

620
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:43,559
I like seeing who wins,
who loses.

621
00:42:43,725 --> 00:42:47,062
It relaxes me.
You know what I mean?

622
00:42:48,647 --> 00:42:50,148
( sighs )

623
00:42:53,235 --> 00:42:55,320
Now they say

624
00:42:55,487 --> 00:42:57,990
that they're gonna stop
publishing newspapers

625
00:42:58,156 --> 00:43:00,367
so people can read the stats
and the box scores

626
00:43:00,534 --> 00:43:02,369
on their fucking cell phone.

627
00:43:02,536 --> 00:43:05,080
Who wants to look at a cell phone
when you're eating food?

628
00:43:05,247 --> 00:43:08,083
It's ridiculous.
I'll tell you what it is--

629
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:10,752
uncivilized.

630
00:43:10,919 --> 00:43:13,255
It's a different world.

631
00:43:13,422 --> 00:43:15,382
Same world,

632
00:43:15,549 --> 00:43:17,426
different toys.

633
00:43:20,387 --> 00:43:22,180
What do you hear
about Petey and the kid?

634
00:43:22,347 --> 00:43:24,182
Nothing yet.

635
00:43:24,349 --> 00:43:26,476
But we grabbed one
of the Russians this morning.

636
00:43:26,643 --> 00:43:28,854
Sal's softening him up
right now.

637
00:43:29,021 --> 00:43:31,440
All right.
Go take a look.

638
00:43:31,607 --> 00:43:34,276
I'll be down there
in a little bit, all right?

639
00:43:34,443 --> 00:43:36,445
- Give me a call if something changes.
- All right.

640
00:43:36,612 --> 00:43:38,864
Will do, boss.

641
00:43:52,544 --> 00:43:54,963
Boss.

642
00:43:57,132 --> 00:43:58,842
What did Petey's mom say?

643
00:43:59,009 --> 00:44:01,178
She hasn't heard anything.

644
00:44:01,345 --> 00:44:03,847
And the sisters,
no one's seen him.

645
00:44:06,224 --> 00:44:07,809
This way.

646
00:44:09,311 --> 00:44:11,313
Thanks.

647
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:20,489
How's it going, Sal?
He tell you anything?

648
00:44:20,656 --> 00:44:24,951
- Not much.
- Hey, Ivan.

649
00:44:25,118 --> 00:44:27,663
Oh. Hey, buddy.

650
00:44:30,499 --> 00:44:32,459
Hey. Hey.

651
00:44:33,835 --> 00:44:37,172
How you doing in there?

652
00:44:37,339 --> 00:44:40,884
Sal, this defeats the whole fucking
purpose of interrogating him.

653
00:44:41,051 --> 00:44:43,470
How are you gonna get anything
out of him if he's dead?

654
00:44:43,637 --> 00:44:46,431
You brought me all the way
down here for this?

655
00:44:46,598 --> 00:44:48,433
Now you've got to go get
another Russian, all right?

656
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:51,853
( man whispering )

657
00:45:09,913 --> 00:45:12,124
I was hoping I'd see
you again, my son.

658
00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:14,459
You can leave
the burden of life

659
00:45:14,626 --> 00:45:16,211
at the door
of God's house.

660
00:45:16,378 --> 00:45:19,715
You really believe
all this shit, Father?

661
00:45:21,425 --> 00:45:24,136
I mean, if He made good
He also made bad, right?

662
00:45:27,431 --> 00:45:29,516
Do you believe in free will?

663
00:45:29,683 --> 00:45:31,435
The idea that you are free

664
00:45:31,601 --> 00:45:33,770
to make your own choice
in this world.

665
00:45:33,937 --> 00:45:35,355
Of course.

666
00:45:35,522 --> 00:45:38,150
Then how could you make a choice
between right and wrong

667
00:45:38,316 --> 00:45:40,902
if God did not offer
the two extremes?

668
00:45:41,069 --> 00:45:44,573
The path to God is based
upon your ability

669
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:47,451
as a thinking, feeling being

670
00:45:47,617 --> 00:45:49,494
to make the correct
decisions.

671
00:45:49,661 --> 00:45:52,748
If everything was perfect,
then you wouldn't be on earth.

672
00:45:52,914 --> 00:45:55,917
You'd already be in heaven.

673
00:45:56,084 --> 00:45:58,044
You don't live
in my world, Father.

674
00:45:58,211 --> 00:46:01,757
God can forgive
almost anything, my son.

675
00:46:03,175 --> 00:46:05,927
But you must open
your heart to Him.

676
00:46:16,563 --> 00:46:19,107
( control tower chatter )

677
00:46:44,633 --> 00:46:46,051
Aw, Christ.

678
00:46:46,218 --> 00:46:48,678
Back five fucking minutes,
I got to deal with this asshole.

679
00:46:48,845 --> 00:46:50,305
Vincent:
Hey, Johnny.

680
00:46:50,472 --> 00:46:53,642
Welcome back.
How was Vegas?

681
00:46:53,809 --> 00:46:55,143
- Hot.
- Yeah?

682
00:46:55,310 --> 00:46:56,895
Yeah, what else
you want to know?

683
00:46:57,062 --> 00:47:00,398
-I need to talk to you.
- I heard you got a problem with ghosts.

684
00:47:00,565 --> 00:47:02,150
- Ghosts?
- Yeah.

685
00:47:02,317 --> 00:47:03,693
People that should
be dead, but ain't.

686
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:06,154
What the fuck did I tell you?
If you're gonna whack someone,

687
00:47:06,321 --> 00:47:08,448
you put two in the head. That way
they can't come back for you.

688
00:47:08,615 --> 00:47:10,325
- Yeah, I know.
- You know, but you didn't do that,

689
00:47:10,492 --> 00:47:12,577
did you?
Now you got problems.

690
00:47:12,744 --> 00:47:14,746
Yeah, I was kind of hoping
you could help me out.

691
00:47:14,913 --> 00:47:16,957
I already helped you out.
I took care of the cops.

692
00:47:17,123 --> 00:47:18,875
Come on, man, you got a cut.

693
00:47:19,042 --> 00:47:21,920
For protection. I ain't going
to war for you, kid.

694
00:47:22,087 --> 00:47:24,840
- I'm not asking you to go to war for--
- You shut the fuck up.

695
00:47:25,006 --> 00:47:29,094
Listen, that friend of yours,
somehow he got Biggs involved.

696
00:47:29,261 --> 00:47:30,887
That changed everything.

697
00:47:31,054 --> 00:47:33,932
This guy don't fuck around.
He's the most ruthless,

698
00:47:34,099 --> 00:47:37,185
cold motherfucker you'll ever meet.
You know what happened

699
00:47:37,352 --> 00:47:39,604
-to the last guy who fucked with him?
- No.

700
00:47:39,771 --> 00:47:41,898
Let's just say he got
a closed-casket funeral.

701
00:47:42,065 --> 00:47:45,318
I can't do anything on this.
You're on your own.

702
00:47:45,485 --> 00:47:47,821
( huffs )
All right.

703
00:47:47,988 --> 00:47:50,031
And I'll tell you something else.

704
00:47:50,198 --> 00:47:53,869
If Biggs reaches out for me,
I'm gonna deliver you.

705
00:47:54,035 --> 00:47:56,454
Just like that?

706
00:47:56,621 --> 00:47:58,957
It's business.

707
00:48:05,547 --> 00:48:07,632
John.

708
00:48:08,884 --> 00:48:11,052
Fuck.

709
00:48:46,421 --> 00:48:48,423
( sniffles )

710
00:49:15,158 --> 00:49:17,953
Sonny?

711
00:49:23,667 --> 00:49:25,877
- Hey.
- I'm sorry.

712
00:49:26,878 --> 00:49:29,255
( Sobs )

713
00:49:45,063 --> 00:49:47,482
He always said that

714
00:49:47,649 --> 00:49:50,402
he'd be okay as long
as you were there.

715
00:49:56,741 --> 00:49:58,660
I'll make it better.

716
00:50:31,026 --> 00:50:32,485
Long time.

717
00:50:33,737 --> 00:50:35,155
Only 13 years.

718
00:50:35,321 --> 00:50:37,032
I can't help you.

719
00:50:37,198 --> 00:50:39,034
I didn't come here
to ask you for your help.

720
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,702
Well, then why
don't you get to it?

721
00:50:40,869 --> 00:50:43,163
They only let me out of
my cage for about 15 minutes.

722
00:50:43,329 --> 00:50:46,583
I came to ask

723
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:49,127
is there anything you
want me to tell your son

724
00:50:49,294 --> 00:50:51,796
before I kill him?

725
00:50:54,841 --> 00:50:57,385
You know, if this glass wasn't
between us I'd break your fucking neck

726
00:50:57,552 --> 00:50:59,262
- for talking to me that way!
- The glass is there.

727
00:50:59,429 --> 00:51:00,847
Hey. Hey!

728
00:51:01,014 --> 00:51:02,640
- That's it, let's go.
- You hear that?

729
00:51:02,807 --> 00:51:05,351
That's it, let's go.
Let's go.

730
00:51:05,518 --> 00:51:07,479
- That's it.
- This crazy motherfucker.

731
00:51:07,645 --> 00:51:09,898
All right, all right.

732
00:51:14,527 --> 00:51:16,863
- Is he here?
- Yeah, but he's busy right--

733
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:19,074
What the fuck? Mia.

734
00:51:20,408 --> 00:51:22,077
So you gonna be around
later on?

735
00:51:24,829 --> 00:51:26,498
- Yo, Mia, what the fuck?
- Get rid of her.

736
00:51:26,664 --> 00:51:28,500
- Hey.
- What?

737
00:51:28,666 --> 00:51:30,794
Get your shit
and get going.

738
00:51:32,504 --> 00:51:35,548
I guess just go.

739
00:51:35,715 --> 00:51:37,592
You're a fucking asshole.

740
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:41,930
This is why we're in a world
of shit, Vincent.

741
00:51:42,097 --> 00:51:43,765
Because you're off
fucking around

742
00:51:43,932 --> 00:51:45,350
instead of taking care
of business.

743
00:51:45,517 --> 00:51:47,519
Calm down.
I'm tying up the loose ends.

744
00:51:47,685 --> 00:51:51,439
Loose ends? The only fucking
loose end is Sonny.

745
00:51:51,606 --> 00:51:55,235
I am telling you, Vincent,
do not underestimate him.

746
00:51:55,401 --> 00:51:57,112
I grew up with Sonny.
He's a hothead.

747
00:51:57,278 --> 00:51:59,197
He'll always come through
the front door.

748
00:51:59,364 --> 00:52:01,241
Great, so we'll just wait
for the doorbell to ring, right?

749
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:03,409
Mia, enough.

750
00:52:19,384 --> 00:52:22,220
Man on P.A.: We need a backup
register open, please.

751
00:52:22,387 --> 00:52:24,681
Backup register open, please.

752
00:52:29,310 --> 00:52:30,812
This what you want?

753
00:52:33,773 --> 00:52:35,942
All cashiers
please come to the front.

754
00:52:36,109 --> 00:52:38,111
All cashiers to the front.

755
00:52:53,751 --> 00:52:56,588
-( knocking )
- It's open, Vincent.

756
00:53:00,008 --> 00:53:01,926
( gasps )

757
00:53:04,095 --> 00:53:06,681
- ( grunts )
- ( screams )

758
00:53:08,433 --> 00:53:10,894
We're done with
the small talk, hmm?

759
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:12,896
( panting )

760
00:53:13,062 --> 00:53:14,522
Where are my diamonds?

761
00:53:14,689 --> 00:53:16,399
I sold them.

762
00:53:16,566 --> 00:53:19,027
( tisks )
Wrong answer.

763
00:53:19,194 --> 00:53:21,905
(whimpering )

764
00:53:24,073 --> 00:53:26,367
Oh, come on.

765
00:53:31,539 --> 00:53:33,917
( moans )

766
00:53:34,083 --> 00:53:37,378
So this is fun for you?
Huh?

767
00:53:37,545 --> 00:53:39,380
( coughs )

768
00:53:39,547 --> 00:53:41,132
Want to go again?

769
00:53:41,299 --> 00:53:43,718
You have a lot
of nice things here.

770
00:53:43,885 --> 00:53:45,970
( coughs )

771
00:53:49,974 --> 00:53:52,518
( sighs )

772
00:53:52,685 --> 00:53:54,562
Is this all worth it?

773
00:53:57,357 --> 00:54:00,151
Yeah, it is.

774
00:54:00,318 --> 00:54:03,738
Ooh, scary-- blood.

775
00:54:06,574 --> 00:54:08,576
- ( shatters )
- ( whimpers )

776
00:54:11,955 --> 00:54:15,792
Give me my diamonds
and we're done.

777
00:54:15,959 --> 00:54:18,211
Fuck you!

778
00:54:43,945 --> 00:54:45,780
Fuck, man.
I'm starving.

779
00:54:45,947 --> 00:54:48,825
We'll get something
on the way back home.

780
00:54:50,243 --> 00:54:51,869
What you in the mood for?

781
00:54:52,036 --> 00:54:54,038
Shit, like a fucking salad.

782
00:54:54,205 --> 00:54:55,915
What the hell?

783
00:54:56,082 --> 00:54:58,126
What's wrong with you, man?

784
00:55:01,838 --> 00:55:04,549
Yo, Mia.

785
00:55:07,343 --> 00:55:09,762
Mia.

786
00:55:28,781 --> 00:55:30,616
Fuck.

787
00:55:34,996 --> 00:55:37,206
Mia?

788
00:55:44,797 --> 00:55:46,674
Fuck.

789
00:55:53,473 --> 00:55:55,683
Oh fuck.

790
00:55:57,685 --> 00:56:00,480
We've got to get
the fuck out of here, Vince.

791
00:56:00,646 --> 00:56:03,358
We've got to go.

792
00:56:03,524 --> 00:56:05,526
- Let's go.
- Get off me!

793
00:56:05,693 --> 00:56:09,030
I'm sorry, man.
We've got to get the fuck out of here.

794
00:56:09,197 --> 00:56:11,115
Shut up.

795
00:56:22,001 --> 00:56:24,504
I'm sorry, girl.

796
00:56:42,855 --> 00:56:44,399
( muffled screams )

797
00:56:44,565 --> 00:56:47,443
- Biggs: Frankie, how's it going?
- Nothing, boss.

798
00:56:47,610 --> 00:56:49,070
No one's seen
or heard anything.

799
00:56:49,237 --> 00:56:50,988
They must have whacked
the both of them.

800
00:56:51,155 --> 00:56:53,408
Listen, you stupid fucking
Russian son of a bitch,

801
00:56:53,574 --> 00:56:55,743
if you're not gonna plan
on growing gills anytime soon,

802
00:56:55,910 --> 00:56:57,870
I'd suggest you tell the man
what he wants to know.

803
00:56:58,037 --> 00:56:59,997
Black man took the money.

804
00:57:00,164 --> 00:57:02,625
That's all I see.
He took it.

805
00:57:12,009 --> 00:57:15,179
10 bucks says when he comes up
for air he starts screaming about God.

806
00:57:15,346 --> 00:57:16,431
- 20.
- Bet.

807
00:57:16,597 --> 00:57:18,391
Tony:
Bring him up.

808
00:57:18,558 --> 00:57:21,394
( sputtering )

809
00:57:21,561 --> 00:57:23,604
Oh, mother of God!

810
00:57:23,771 --> 00:57:25,857
( laughs )

811
00:57:26,023 --> 00:57:28,943
Hey, Aqualung.

812
00:57:29,110 --> 00:57:31,112
Let me tell you something.
God ain't here.

813
00:57:31,279 --> 00:57:34,198
Okay?
God has left Detroit.

814
00:57:34,365 --> 00:57:36,451
I'm your only god today.

815
00:57:36,617 --> 00:57:39,537
So you'd better tell me
what happened to my boy Petey,

816
00:57:39,704 --> 00:57:41,330
what happened
to the black man,

817
00:57:41,497 --> 00:57:43,708
and what happened
to my fucking money.

818
00:57:43,875 --> 00:57:46,961
- You hear me?
- Man with gun, he took your money.

819
00:57:47,128 --> 00:57:50,673
He took your money.
I tell the truth. I tell the truth!

820
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:52,800
( laughs )
You're a tough son of a bitch.

821
00:57:52,967 --> 00:57:54,969
Back in the pool, Tony.

822
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:04,562
- You see that game last night?
- Yeah.

823
00:58:04,729 --> 00:58:07,148
It was a ball. Way outside.

824
00:58:07,315 --> 00:58:08,941
No fucking way
that was a strike.

825
00:58:09,108 --> 00:58:11,486
Ump walked to the plate,
he couldn't see shit.

826
00:58:11,652 --> 00:58:13,279
- They should use that computer box.
- Yeah.

827
00:58:13,446 --> 00:58:16,157
- Way outside.
- Fuckin' ump is like Mr. fucking Magoo.

828
00:58:16,324 --> 00:58:17,950
He can't see anything.

829
00:58:18,993 --> 00:58:20,745
I think he's drowning, boss.

830
00:58:23,289 --> 00:58:24,832
Pull him up.

831
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:31,672
-( laughs)
-I think he's dead.

832
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:33,466
I think he was telling the truth.

833
00:58:33,633 --> 00:58:35,009
( laughs )

834
00:58:35,176 --> 00:58:37,845
Listen, come and get me
after you clean this up.

835
00:58:38,012 --> 00:58:41,098
- I'm gonna go get a massage.
- Will do. Let's get him.

836
00:58:42,475 --> 00:58:44,352
( beeps )

837
00:58:48,731 --> 00:58:50,608
( phone ringing )

838
00:58:52,693 --> 00:58:56,364
Yeah? Yeah, I'll be there.
I'm just running a few minutes late.

839
00:59:24,392 --> 00:59:27,270
- I don't like to be kept waiting.
- Whatever.

840
00:59:35,111 --> 00:59:37,321
- You're light.
- it's all there.

841
00:59:37,488 --> 00:59:40,533
No it isn't.
You're light.

842
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:42,368
What the fuck are you
trying to say, Saunders?

843
00:59:42,535 --> 00:59:44,412
The warden said
the price went up.

844
00:59:44,579 --> 00:59:46,289
No no no.
We had a deal.

845
00:59:46,455 --> 00:59:49,584
Yeah, you paid for a year's
worth of protection.

846
00:59:49,750 --> 00:59:52,420
And now you're gonna
have to pay more.

847
00:59:52,587 --> 00:59:56,173
You want the old man kept
in protective custody?

848
00:59:56,340 --> 00:59:59,427
You pay $100,000 upfront.

849
00:59:59,594 --> 01:00:01,596
This is bullshit.

850
01:00:01,762 --> 01:00:03,431
How long do you think
that old man's

851
01:00:03,598 --> 01:00:05,933
gonna stay in
the general population?

852
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:09,478
I give him two days before
the brothers cut him a new one.

853
01:00:09,645 --> 01:00:11,814
You want that on your head?

854
01:00:11,981 --> 01:00:16,152
I know you're about family,
so do the right thing, Vince.

855
01:00:16,319 --> 01:00:18,571
Be the good son.

856
01:00:24,368 --> 01:00:27,872
You'd better think this through
before you pull that trigger.

857
01:00:29,165 --> 01:00:30,791
You fuck up with us

858
01:00:30,958 --> 01:00:33,002
and your old man's
a stain on the floor.

859
01:00:33,169 --> 01:00:35,504
Got it?

860
01:00:35,671 --> 01:00:38,591
You got 24 hours.

861
01:00:38,758 --> 01:00:40,926
Or we feed him to the animals.

862
01:00:41,093 --> 01:00:43,220
Get out.

863
01:01:22,301 --> 01:01:24,303
Mia's dead.

864
01:01:31,686 --> 01:01:33,354
What do you want me to say?

865
01:01:33,521 --> 01:01:36,524
Say fucking something.
Anything.

866
01:01:36,691 --> 01:01:37,817
There's nothing to say.

867
01:01:37,983 --> 01:01:39,652
You don't even
want to know how?

868
01:01:39,819 --> 01:01:41,404
It doesn't fucking matter.

869
01:01:41,570 --> 01:01:43,698
You're out there making
mistake after mistake.

870
01:01:43,864 --> 01:01:45,366
And you wonder why she's dead?

871
01:01:45,533 --> 01:01:46,951
What am I doing wrong?

872
01:01:47,118 --> 01:01:49,453
Well, Sonny for one.

873
01:01:51,664 --> 01:01:53,332
How do you know
about Sonny?

874
01:01:53,499 --> 01:01:55,209
He came to visit me.

875
01:01:55,376 --> 01:01:57,128
He sat right where
you're sitting right now

876
01:01:57,294 --> 01:02:00,047
on the other side of this glass
and he looked me in the eye.

877
01:02:00,214 --> 01:02:02,717
Can you do the same?

878
01:02:04,719 --> 01:02:06,345
I'm doing my best.

879
01:02:06,512 --> 01:02:08,097
Well, it's not good enough.

880
01:02:08,264 --> 01:02:10,141
What am I supposed to do?

881
01:02:10,307 --> 01:02:12,309
( sighs )

882
01:02:14,812 --> 01:02:17,732
You really are a little shit.
You know that?

883
01:02:17,898 --> 01:02:20,109
I never thought
I'd have to say that.

884
01:02:20,276 --> 01:02:24,196
Big men make
big moves, Vincent.

885
01:02:24,363 --> 01:02:26,907
Are you a big man?

886
01:03:14,830 --> 01:03:16,791
( groans )

887
01:03:54,119 --> 01:03:55,996
Hey.

888
01:04:27,403 --> 01:04:29,780
Sonny's voice: I knew Biggs
had to be hot on my trail.

889
01:04:29,947 --> 01:04:32,157
You don't take $2 million
from a guy like that

890
01:04:32,324 --> 01:04:34,076
and expect him
to forget about it.

891
01:04:38,747 --> 01:04:41,584
Biggs: No no, you've got
to explain it to me again.

892
01:04:43,210 --> 01:04:45,796
The same guy that
shot you whacked Petey,

893
01:04:45,963 --> 01:04:48,841
took my money, and you want me
to believe that?

894
01:04:49,008 --> 01:04:50,718
Yes.

895
01:04:50,885 --> 01:04:54,179
I told you I was looking for him
when you first grabbed me, remember?

896
01:04:54,346 --> 01:04:56,515
You think I'd be sitting here
if I had your money?

897
01:04:56,682 --> 01:04:58,976
Shit, I ain't crazy.

898
01:05:04,398 --> 01:05:05,816
What?

899
01:05:08,777 --> 01:05:12,281
- Where's my money?
- Vincent has your money.

900
01:05:12,448 --> 01:05:14,700
Your friend Vincent?

901
01:05:14,867 --> 01:05:16,660
Yes.

902
01:05:16,827 --> 01:05:20,122
I know where Vincent is
and I know where the money is.

903
01:05:20,289 --> 01:05:23,208
There's just one problem.
He's got an army around him.

904
01:05:23,375 --> 01:05:26,837
An army of juvenile
delinquents with pistols?

905
01:05:27,004 --> 01:05:29,673
Give me some of your men and we'll go
get the money and bring it right back.

906
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:33,427
I have a different plan.
Come on.

907
01:05:42,144 --> 01:05:43,604
You all right?

908
01:05:43,771 --> 01:05:45,230
Yeah, I'm cool.

909
01:05:45,397 --> 01:05:47,524
You sure?

910
01:05:49,526 --> 01:05:51,362
All right.

911
01:05:52,863 --> 01:05:54,365
You want a drink?

912
01:05:54,531 --> 01:05:56,575
No thank you.

913
01:05:57,660 --> 01:05:59,411
Might help you relax a little.

914
01:06:03,832 --> 01:06:06,877
Why is it rich people
are always telling me to relax?

915
01:06:08,671 --> 01:06:11,840
'Cause you're young.
You're a young man.

916
01:06:12,007 --> 01:06:15,469
Young guys just want
to run through their life

917
01:06:15,636 --> 01:06:17,054
as fast as they can.

918
01:06:17,221 --> 01:06:20,557
Set it up, knock it down.
Set it up, knock it down.

919
01:06:22,309 --> 01:06:24,436
It's short, real short.

920
01:06:24,603 --> 01:06:27,356
You get to be my age
you see just how short it is.

921
01:06:27,523 --> 01:06:30,567
The older you get, the closer
you get to your death,

922
01:06:30,734 --> 01:06:33,570
you want to relax.
You want to take your time.

923
01:06:35,155 --> 01:06:36,824
There's no rush, kid.

924
01:06:39,994 --> 01:06:41,787
You sure you don't want
that drink?

925
01:06:43,831 --> 01:06:45,833
Yeah, I'll take a drink.

926
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,669
- Bourbon or Scotch?
- Bourbon.

927
01:07:10,691 --> 01:07:12,693
Crap.

928
01:07:17,197 --> 01:07:19,533
You should know I hate
this John R prick.

929
01:07:19,700 --> 01:07:22,828
Just let me do the talking
when we get there, all right?

930
01:07:39,762 --> 01:07:41,472
Hey, you go to church?

931
01:07:43,265 --> 01:07:45,392
I used to.

932
01:07:45,559 --> 01:07:48,437
It got to a point they didn't want
to see me there anymore.

933
01:07:50,981 --> 01:07:53,108
I still help them out
with donations.

934
01:07:54,902 --> 01:07:58,155
I could see those priests
up there sweating.

935
01:07:58,322 --> 01:08:00,407
I made them nervous.

936
01:08:00,574 --> 01:08:02,868
So you believe in God?

937
01:08:03,035 --> 01:08:05,996
I don't know
if I believe in their God.

938
01:08:06,163 --> 01:08:09,792
Yeah, I pray.

939
01:08:11,085 --> 01:08:12,711
I pray every night.

940
01:08:12,878 --> 01:08:16,090
I need a God that's got
a lot of forgiveness.

941
01:08:19,259 --> 01:08:21,261
You're gonna be
all right though.

942
01:08:21,428 --> 01:08:23,138
Don't worry about a thing.

943
01:09:04,304 --> 01:09:07,474
What's the matter, Vince? You look
like you've seen a fucking ghost.

944
01:09:15,649 --> 01:09:18,527
- You know why we're here, John?
- Yeah, I know.

945
01:09:18,694 --> 01:09:20,362
That's the kid
you wanted to see.

946
01:09:21,572 --> 01:09:22,948
Consider him delivered.

947
01:09:23,115 --> 01:09:25,284
Where's my money?

948
01:09:25,450 --> 01:09:26,827
I don't know
what you're talking about.

949
01:09:26,994 --> 01:09:28,495
Give him
his fucking money, Vince.

950
01:09:28,662 --> 01:09:30,873
I don't know what this dude
told you, but it's bullshit.

951
01:09:32,416 --> 01:09:34,501
Last chance.

952
01:09:36,587 --> 01:09:38,380
With all due respect,
I know exactly who you are

953
01:09:38,547 --> 01:09:40,257
and I would never
fucking steal--

954
01:09:40,424 --> 01:09:42,759
John: Jesus Christ!
Take it easy.

955
01:09:42,926 --> 01:09:44,928
Everybody just take it easy.
God damn it.

956
01:09:45,095 --> 01:09:46,680
That's for Petey.

957
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:51,226
John: You got something
of this man's, you give it to him now.

958
01:09:51,393 --> 01:09:53,020
Or we could all die, John.

959
01:09:57,107 --> 01:09:58,901
(grunts)

960
01:09:59,067 --> 01:10:01,111
( gunshots )

961
01:10:41,276 --> 01:10:43,070
Shit.

962
01:10:53,830 --> 01:10:55,415
Oh! Hey!

963
01:11:06,301 --> 01:11:08,345
- ( tires screech )
-( horn honks )

964
01:11:15,894 --> 01:11:17,604
(grunts)

965
01:11:25,570 --> 01:11:28,115
- Move!
-( pans clatter)

966
01:11:30,867 --> 01:11:33,453
- ( gunshots )
-( people screaming )

967
01:11:48,510 --> 01:11:50,637
Woman:
Watch out.

968
01:12:16,955 --> 01:12:18,790
Fuck!

969
01:12:35,849 --> 01:12:37,934
(dialing )

970
01:12:39,686 --> 01:12:42,481
Saunders, don't you
fucking move my dad.

971
01:12:42,647 --> 01:12:45,025
I've got your money
and I'll be there in an hour.

972
01:12:48,445 --> 01:12:50,405
Going somewhere?

973
01:12:50,572 --> 01:12:52,908
Who the fuck are you?

974
01:12:53,075 --> 01:12:54,534
That's not the topic.

975
01:12:54,701 --> 01:12:56,328
All right,
what is the topic?

976
01:12:56,495 --> 01:12:58,705
Diamonds.
Mm-hmm.

977
01:12:58,872 --> 01:13:01,083
That's right.
Sit down.

978
01:13:01,249 --> 01:13:03,460
Sit down!

979
01:13:06,546 --> 01:13:10,300
You know, in some countries
they cut off the hand that steals.

980
01:13:10,467 --> 01:13:12,511
And you stole from us.

981
01:13:12,677 --> 01:13:15,722
So the way I see it,
you have three choices:

982
01:13:15,889 --> 01:13:18,225
you can fuck around,

983
01:13:18,392 --> 01:13:20,310
in which case I kill you;

984
01:13:20,477 --> 01:13:23,980
you can go for that gun
on the desk

985
01:13:24,147 --> 01:13:26,608
and I kill you;

986
01:13:26,775 --> 01:13:30,529
or you can just
give me the diamonds

987
01:13:30,695 --> 01:13:32,030
and I'll let you disappear.

988
01:13:32,197 --> 01:13:34,074
Yeah right.

989
01:13:34,241 --> 01:13:36,451
Look, my friend,

990
01:13:36,618 --> 01:13:39,913
you're not half as tough
as your little girlfriend.

991
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:42,416
And at the end

992
01:13:42,582 --> 01:13:44,292
she talked.

993
01:13:46,169 --> 01:13:48,755
So what is it going to be?

994
01:13:48,922 --> 01:13:50,841
She wasn't my girlfriend.

995
01:13:51,007 --> 01:13:53,260
She was my family.

996
01:13:54,886 --> 01:13:56,346
- ( gunshot )
- ( screams )

997
01:14:00,434 --> 01:14:02,853
You got off easy,
motherfucker.

998
01:15:09,836 --> 01:15:11,296
(grunts)

999
01:15:11,463 --> 01:15:13,798
( groans )

1000
01:15:15,759 --> 01:15:18,178
( Vincent coughing )

1001
01:15:26,311 --> 01:15:29,689
( coughing, sputtering )

1002
01:15:42,953 --> 01:15:44,621
(coughing )

1003
01:15:50,752 --> 01:15:53,004
isn't much fun dying,
huh, Vince?

1004
01:15:54,047 --> 01:15:56,132
Start digging.

1005
01:15:56,299 --> 01:15:59,052
Are you fucking
kidding me, man?

1006
01:15:59,219 --> 01:16:01,596
You want me to dig
my own goddamn grave?

1007
01:16:01,763 --> 01:16:05,267
Don't make me say it again.
I said start digging.

1008
01:16:07,269 --> 01:16:09,437
And make sure it's deep
so you're comfortable.

1009
01:16:09,604 --> 01:16:11,982
How much do you want?

1010
01:16:12,148 --> 01:16:15,527
Huh? How much is my life
worth to you?

1011
01:16:15,694 --> 01:16:19,281
A rat's skin is only worth
something to a rat, Vince.

1012
01:16:19,447 --> 01:16:22,534
Man, bullshit.
Come on.

1013
01:16:22,701 --> 01:16:24,995
Who are you to judge me?

1014
01:16:25,161 --> 01:16:28,415
You ever thought about where
the fuck you'd be without me?

1015
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:32,752
Yeah, I thought about that

1016
01:16:32,919 --> 01:16:35,171
when I thought I was
taking my last breath.

1017
01:16:35,338 --> 01:16:38,883
Man, who was the one
out there making contacts,

1018
01:16:39,050 --> 01:16:41,094
setting up scores while you
and Dave was getting high?

1019
01:16:41,261 --> 01:16:42,804
Huh? Me.

1020
01:16:42,971 --> 01:16:44,723
Who was the one who
brought you in on shit,

1021
01:16:44,889 --> 01:16:47,559
put money in your pockets,
helped you support your moms?

1022
01:16:47,726 --> 01:16:50,645
- Me!
- That's what I don't understand, man.

1023
01:16:50,812 --> 01:16:52,314
That's what--

1024
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:54,983
We were family, man.
We were brothers.

1025
01:16:55,150 --> 01:16:58,486
- You, me and Dave--
- Fuck Dave, dude.

1026
01:16:58,653 --> 01:17:00,572
Come on.
That stuttering little bitch.

1027
01:17:00,739 --> 01:17:02,365
This is about us, man.

1028
01:17:02,532 --> 01:17:05,452
How long before him and his big-ass
mouth would have got us all whacked?

1029
01:17:05,619 --> 01:17:08,288
- ( gunshot)
- ( groaning )

1030
01:17:12,083 --> 01:17:14,836
- He was loyal.
- ( groaning )

1031
01:17:18,131 --> 01:17:20,216
He was weak.

1032
01:17:20,383 --> 01:17:22,427
He was my friend.

1033
01:17:22,594 --> 01:17:24,012
Just like you, Vince.
Remember?

1034
01:17:24,179 --> 01:17:26,056
Oh fuck.

1035
01:17:27,307 --> 01:17:30,769
Let me tell you something
as your friend, Sonny.

1036
01:17:30,935 --> 01:17:33,938
Everything you got in this world
is because of me.

1037
01:17:34,105 --> 01:17:37,025
Everything you fucking are
in this world

1038
01:17:37,192 --> 01:17:39,611
is because of me.

1039
01:17:39,778 --> 01:17:41,696
What could you have gotten into

1040
01:17:41,863 --> 01:17:43,740
that was so bad that you
couldn't tell me?

1041
01:17:43,907 --> 01:17:46,701
Huh?
Tell me, I want to know.

1042
01:17:49,412 --> 01:17:51,831
I had your back
since we were kids, man.

1043
01:17:51,998 --> 01:17:54,751
And what do you do? You fucking
shoot me and leave me for dead.

1044
01:17:54,918 --> 01:17:58,088
I had no choice, man.
I was in over my head.

1045
01:17:58,254 --> 01:18:00,674
I couldn't--
I needed all the money.

1046
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:03,051
They were gonna--
they were gonna kill my father.

1047
01:18:03,218 --> 01:18:06,012
- What?
- They were gonna kill my dad.

1048
01:18:07,555 --> 01:18:11,184
Sonny, you're right, man.

1049
01:18:11,351 --> 01:18:13,853
And I'm sorry.
I should have come to you.

1050
01:18:15,730 --> 01:18:18,274
But you-- you've gotta tell me,
what can I do right now?

1051
01:18:18,441 --> 01:18:21,653
How can I make this right, man?
Tell me what to do.

1052
01:18:23,238 --> 01:18:25,699
You should have thought
about that before.

1053
01:18:27,283 --> 01:18:30,286
You make peace with God,
not me.

1054
01:18:30,453 --> 01:18:32,622
Do it.

1055
01:18:32,789 --> 01:18:35,542
Fucking do it, Sonny.
Shoot my ass.

1056
01:18:35,709 --> 01:18:38,586
'Cause you know what? You ain't nothing
in this world without me, man.

1057
01:18:38,753 --> 01:18:41,589
You shoot me
and we're the same.

1058
01:18:41,756 --> 01:18:43,842
We'll both be gone.

1059
01:18:50,432 --> 01:18:52,267
We're not the same.

1060
01:18:54,561 --> 01:18:56,688
You're fucking pathetic, man.

1061
01:18:58,356 --> 01:19:00,692
Man, fuck you!

1062
01:19:00,859 --> 01:19:02,694
Fuck you, man!

1063
01:19:02,861 --> 01:19:04,320
I don't need you, Sonny.

1064
01:19:04,487 --> 01:19:06,281
I don't need you, man.
You need me.

1065
01:19:06,448 --> 01:19:09,617
You need me!

1066
01:19:09,784 --> 01:19:13,079
I'm gonna walk out of here.
You'll see, man.

1067
01:19:13,246 --> 01:19:16,875
You hear me?
You hear me?!

1068
01:19:17,041 --> 01:19:19,669
Fuck you!

1069
01:19:20,670 --> 01:19:22,172
I'll find your ass!

1070
01:19:22,338 --> 01:19:24,048
Fuck you, Sonny!

1071
01:19:32,432 --> 01:19:34,976
- ( grunts )
- Yo, man, check it out. Check it out.

1072
01:19:39,355 --> 01:19:41,232
Man: Yo, it was nice
knowing you, buddy.

1073
01:19:41,399 --> 01:19:43,359
- ( alarm sounding )
- Break it up! Make a hole!

1074
01:19:43,526 --> 01:19:46,404
- Get back! Get back!
- Back off!

1075
01:19:46,571 --> 01:19:48,615
- Back off!
-I need a medic in Red.

1076
01:19:48,782 --> 01:19:50,658
- Back up.
- Get back.

1077
01:19:50,825 --> 01:19:53,286
Get back on the wall.
Get back.

1078
01:19:53,453 --> 01:19:56,206
Let me see your hand.
Get your hand out of there.

1079
01:20:01,044 --> 01:20:02,337
- How are you doing?
- Hi.

1080
01:20:02,504 --> 01:20:04,464

to sign right here.
