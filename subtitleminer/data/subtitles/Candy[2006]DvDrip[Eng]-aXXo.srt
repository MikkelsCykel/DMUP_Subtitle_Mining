<i> When I first met Candy...</ i>

00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,900
<i> Those were like the 
days of juice...</ i>.

00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,100
Heaven

7
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,800
Here it is. 

8
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,400
I'm gonna try it your way this time. 

9
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,400
This is just as good this way. 
Honestly. 

10
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,600
Then why don't you do it? 

11
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,400
Schumann, 
Why don't I do it? 

12
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,100
Dan is a follower, Candy. 
Not a leader. 

13
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,400
We stick to snorting, keep it simple. 

14
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,200
You know...
Dare to be different! 

15
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,500
Well I think I'd like to try it in the bath. 

16
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,400
well that's different. 

17
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,400
Candy? 

18
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,400
Candy! 

19
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Schumann, fucking help me! 

20
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,200
<i> What?? </ i> 

21
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,000
Come here!

22
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,100
Come here!
Babe?

23
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,400
Oh, Christ! 

24
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,500
Shit, I think that she took too much. 

25
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,900
Babe! 

26
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,800
Fucking saline solution or something?
I need saline solution!

27
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
<i> What? </ i> 

28
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Fuck it!
Go and get a glass of water... 

29
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,700
Put salt in it! 
Hurry up! 

30
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,400
Come on!
Babe! 

31
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,300
Candy! Look at me! 

32
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,599
<i>How much salt? </ i> 

33
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,300
I don't know! HEAPS!

34
00:05:28,301 --> 00:05:30,300
Just fucking stir it! 
Make sure it's dissolved!

35
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,200
Come here!
Oh baby!?? 
Fuck!!

36
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:40,000
I don't think this works man! 
What the fuck's salt gonna do? 

37
00:05:40,001 --> 00:05:41,500
Shut up! 

38
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,200
Fuck! 
Hold her arm! 

39
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,700
Hold her fucking arm, man! 

40
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,700
Harder! 

41
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,800
This will not be. 

42
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,100
Here we go ... 

43
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
No, it's not gonna fucking work!
It's bullshit!! 

44
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,900
Shut up! 

45
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,900
Call an ambulance. 

46
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Here we go. 

47
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,400
Candy, look at me. 

48
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,600
Candy! Candy! 

49
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Candy, Look at me! 

50
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,200
Babe ... 

51
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,800
Bring her back. 

52
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,200
...back. 

53
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,700
Enough with the fucking salt. 

54
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,600
It was beautiful. 

55
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,500
Intense. 

56
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,100
The future or the thing that <i> gleamed. </ i> 

57
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,300
<i> The present was so very, very good. </ i> 

58
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,500
I wasn't trying to <i> 
wreck Candy's life </ i>. 

59
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,200
<i> I was trying to make mine better. </ i> 

60
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,600
<i> We wanted to share absolutely everything </ i>. 

61
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,500
Especially <i> 
the best bits </ i>. 

62
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I want to stay with you 
forever. 

63
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,700
<i> ...and who would'nt! </ i> 

64
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,800
It's us! 

65
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,500
It's called "The afternoon of 
extravagant delight. " 

66
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,900
By Candy Wyatt. 

67
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,400
It's beautiful. 

68
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,900
I love it! 

69
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,100
Casper. 

70
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,000
Casper, It's Dan. 

71
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,100
Daniel, hang on!, I'm coming in on a win and a prayer! 

72
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,600
What? 

73
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,600
I'm trying to land 
a Jumbo in Dubai. 

74
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,600
What? 

75
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,600
Casper was like <i> 
the dad you always wanted. </ i> 

76
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
The one that lets you have lollies and fizzy drinks

77
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,600
<i> he lets you stay up late, </ i> 

78
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,000
<i> and watch movies 
late at night. </ i> 

79
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,300
Daniel, how are you? 

80
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,500
<i> Casper and I went way back. </ i> 

81
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,200
I love you

82
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,400
<i> Is that right? </ i> 

83
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,400
Yes! 

84
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,400
This is George. 

85
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,600
A very limited English, 
but a very large penis. 

86
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,900
Isn't that right, George? 

87
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,900
Ok. 

88
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:15,500
Our entire conversation is based on the 1995 "Lonely Planet" guide to Havana

89
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Sit down. 

90
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,100
Just good friends. 

91
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,400
So, what's on the agenda today? 

92
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,100
<i> Not much, we're just wandering around. </ i> 

93
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,100
Um, Could you spare us $50? 

94
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:40,800
Does is ever embarrassed you, Candy? 
...His naked desperation!

95
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,400
Nakedness, I can deal with! 

96
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,400
Or give us some ecstasy 
we can sell for it? 

97
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,900
I'm afraid that my days 
as a manufacturer of ... 

98
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,900
recreational farmaceuticals
has come to an end. 

99
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:51,900
Why's that? 

100
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,800
I've been made Associate Professor of
Organic Chemistry. 

101
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,800
-Wow! Congratulations. 
-Great. 

102
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,200
So, suddenly I have a 
reputation to uphold. 

103
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,900
Well in that case, could we make it a hundred? 

104
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,300
We'll pay it back! 

105
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,300
Thanks, Cas. 

106
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,300
Everything's alright, isn't it? 

107
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,400
It's just a cash flow problem. 
Only 7 days.

108
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,400
And you, Candy? 

109
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,900
Being one that's so new to the path 
of the dead! 

110
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,100
She is fine. 

111
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:41,600
When you can stop, 
people don't want to... 

112
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,600
... and when you want to stop,
You can't! 

113
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,500
One of life's little riddles! 

114
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,100
What Grandma? 

115
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:56,500
Off you go! 

116
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,500
Thank you, Casper. 

117
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,000
Okay, are you ready? 

118
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
One, two, three ... 

119
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,400
I feel like some confused 
Sesame Street character! 

120
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,600
Start the car. 

121
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,700
My own parents had long since 
cut me adrift

122
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,100
<i> The Wyatts, on the other hand, 
kept their firm hold on the ropes. </ i> 

123
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,200
Do you want more potatoes? 

124
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,900
-It was nice to visit places 
where the fridge was always full.

125
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,900
I shall have to bring my plate round 
when I come here!
 
126
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:34,800
I think you'll find that's part of the carbohydrate.

127
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,800
What do you think? 

128
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:41,400
I don't know. 
I don't know. 

129
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,900
See how you go. 

130
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,000
Stretchers? 

131
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,500
They're like wooden frames you 
stretch the canvass on. 

132
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,600
and anyway, I feel really stupid ... 

133
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:01,600
... I did about a month ago, 
and as of tomorrow I'm gonna lose 
our deposit on the stretchers. 

134
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,500
It is really rude to ask ... 

135
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
... but at least I won't surprise her! 

136
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,800
I can give you the money back 
the next time I see you again. 

137
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,900
Can you ring him, and tell him to 
wait for a week? 

138
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,300
I already tried that pretty much
last week. 

139
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,600
What if I rang him for you? 

140
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,600
I haven't got the card with me. 

141
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,800
How much is it? 

142
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,900
150. 

143
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,900
Mate, the question is not the money. 

144
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,300
I really appreciate it. 

145
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,900
The question...
is the future of my daughter. 

146
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,900
Mate, she's fantastic!

147
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,600
Should see her paintings! 

148
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,100
The question is you. 

149
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,800
When are you gonna do something? 

150
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,300
I've got some ideas. 

151
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,300
I've sent some of my poems into
Heat magazine. 

152
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,600
Here we are! -Milk... 
and sugar, There! 

153
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,400
-Thanks babe!
-Thanks, Elaine. 

154
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,500
You're not a teenager anymore. 

155
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,200
You know that, don't you? 

156
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,200
Yes, I know that, Jim. 

157
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,400
that is why I did'nt want 
you to do it!

158
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,300
No, it's alright! It's fine! 

159
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,600
Look at it!
You've turned it into butter! 

160
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,700
I told you to keep it on blend! 

161
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,900
I put it on "Whip", because 
I'm whipping cream! 

162
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,200
Yes, but you don't know how to use it. 

163
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,600
Right... You do it!! 

164
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,800
-Uhh!! Well it's too late now!! 
-Ah well!! Excuse me!!

165
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,100
Well all these settings are relatve, and if you're not familiar with the workings of the machine ... 

166
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,800
Then why the fuck does it say "Whip"? 

167
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,700
I'll give them ice cream. 

168
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,500
And please don't swear. 

169
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,000
Right!<i> Well, I was going to give you cream, but I'm going to have to give you Ice Cream. </ i> 

170
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,000
<i> - Everything okay in there? 
-Well, we live in hope! </ i>. 

171
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,400
<i> A good place to live. </ i> 

172
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,500
Go!! 

173
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,700
I wonder if that was it? 

174
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,900
If that was what? 

175
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,600
The last shot. 

176
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,700
I wouldn't care. 

177
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,200
It was my Nana's. 

178
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,000
We're going to sell anything 
We're only hocking it! 

179
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,400
We'll get it back! 

180
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
$25. 

181
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,800
...and He doesn't want the paints. 

182
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,800
I'll be back!

183
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:54,400
He said maybe we could work 
something out!. 

184
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Let's go! 

185
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,200
Yes, I fucked him! 

186
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,400
For $50. 

187
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,700
I stink! 

188
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,200
You okay? 

189
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I'm Sorry. 

190
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,100
Don't be! 

191
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,300
<i> Here is the deepest secret, 
that nobody knows </ i>. 

192
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,600
<i> Here is the root of the root,

193

196
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,500
I carry your heart. 

197
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,500
I carry it in my heart. 

198
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,600
Will you marry me? 

199
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,800
We will be man and wife. 

200
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,600
One flesh. 

201
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:03,800
I will ask them if they freely undertake the obligations of marriage ... 

202
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
... and to state that there is no 
legal impediment to the marriage. 

203
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,400
Are you ready, 
freely and without reservation ... 

204

205
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,300

208
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,400
-We are! 
-We are! 

209
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,400
Candice and Dan ... 

210
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,600
Come back, love. 

211
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,400
Ah, okay. 

212
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,400
Alright everyone, Close together! 
Balloons down, Jenny. 

213
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,000
Big smiles, everyone! 
Happy Day! 

214
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,800
One, two... Oh, Shit! 

215
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,900
Schumann! 

216
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:53,000
-One, two... Three! 
-Right...  

217
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,200
Alright everyone! 
Back to our place for a few drinks, 
and a bite to eat? 

218
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,600
I'm sorry, I'm going to have to go, 
I've got an appointment!

219
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,100
Oh! Well, I hope that nobody else 
has got an appointment! 

220
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,400
I'm in for the long hall, Mrs. Wyatt. 

221
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,800
Good. 

222
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,900
No, I hate spelling! 

223
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,700
Yeah, me too! Spelling and maths! 

224
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,900
I was always hopeless at 
spelling and maths. 

225
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
-I like English. 
-English? 

226
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Like stories and stuff?

227
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,200
Yeah!

228
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,700
English and Sport! 

229
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:18,500
Well you can't go wrong there. 

230
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,100
You can be a Sports journalist. 

231
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:20,800
Really? 

232
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,800
I could see you as a 
sports journalist. 

233
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,100
Well, Dan, you're laughing mate! 

234
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,100
Financing this love 
as a married couple. 

235
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,200
You get the first one under your belt,
you pour everything into it. 

236
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,800
After that, the minimum equity is 
what you're after.

237
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,600
You get into as much debt 
as possible. 

238
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,800
It gives you some focus. 

239
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:40,200
I'm not just talking about
real estate. 

240
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,900
I'm talking about a philosophy. 

241
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,100
Would you mind...
if you excuse me for a minute? 

242
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,100
No! Sure!! 

243
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:51,800
Where are you and Dan going
for the honeymoon? 

244
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
- More lemonade? 
Yeah, thanks! 

245
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,600
You're so tight! 
You're selling next year? 

246
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:02,100
Abbots Road! It's just round 
the corner from us! 

247
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,300
Geez, that'll be a change, eh? 

248
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,600
Yeah, I'd rather go to a state school,
but, it's mom and dad... 

249
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,700
<i> Jenny, could you come and help 
with sanwiches </ i> 

250
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,300
I'll give you a hand too, 
Auntie Cap! 

251
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:20,400
- What? 
- What are you doing in there? 

252
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,600
Doing a shit. 

253
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,900
No you're not! 

254
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,500
Open the door. 

255
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,400
I can't! 

256
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,800
<i> You greedy fuckup!!</ i> 

257
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,400
Rather a selfish 
way to begin a marriage! 

258
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,100
Really! All done!

259
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Dick! 

260
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,900
<i> Obviously, it was a 
big dope weekend! </ i> 

261
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,600
You wanna be relaxed at 
your own wedding. </ i> 

262
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,300
-Sorry about that. 
-That's fine! 

263
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,100
So where were we? 

264
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:04,900
I was saying, you need to get your t... 

265
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,200
-Do you need a seat? 
Yeah, sure! Have a seat!

266
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
You need to get your toe in the
the market, Jim! 

267
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,500
You know what I'mn saying? 
Out of suburbs, fine! 

268
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Two bedroom... 

269
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,500
...You don't need a garden 
courtyard, do you?

270
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,900
You want the worst house, 
in the best street! 

271
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,700
You don't need a kitchen or bathroom... 

272
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,200
...Put it in later!

273
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,300
Say for example, 
you want to borrow ... 

274
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,700
...400. 

275
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:31,900
Or 300... 

276
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:42,200
You do it... 
You Struggle...

277
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,200
Understand? 

278
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,500
Dan? 

279
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Dan? 

280
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,400
Dan! 

281
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,900
Dan... 

282
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,400
Wake up. 

283
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,500
Dan, Dan, wake up. 

284
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,100
I'm fucked. 

285
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,800
Too much champagne. 

286
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Yeah I'm...
I'm sure it's that... 

287
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,100
Well, it is the big day! 

288
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,100
<i> I'll make some coffee. </ i> 

289
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,300
<i> He's drunk! </ i> 

290
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,800
<i> Is there anything you 
want to talk to me about?</ i> 

291
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
<i> What? </ i> 

292
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,400
What's going on? 

293
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,000
Mum, you know what's going on! 

294
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,100
We are having a lovely time!

295
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,100
That's not what I meant. 

296
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,100
Well then, I don't know what you mean! 

297
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,300
What's wrong with Dan? 

298
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:44,000
He's just pissed, Mum!
He's hopeless!! 

299
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,400
Sorry. 

300
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,400
Thanks for the beautiful reception. 

301
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
It'd kill your father, you know. 

302
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,400
Think we should stop? 

303
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,900
-What? Now that we're respectable? 
-Yeah, I know!

304
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,100
You know what I mean. 

305
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,800
Whenever you say the word. 

306
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,800
We are the coolest people
in McDonalds!

307
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,400
<i> We had a lot going for us. </ i> 

308
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,200
We'd found the secret glue <i>

309
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,100
<i> in a perfect place...</ i>

311
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,900

312
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:15,300
Earth

313
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,100
-Hey baby! 
-Hi! 

314
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,400
How was it? 

315
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,900
About the same. 

316
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,700
Here's $200. 

317
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,300
I'm gonna give it half an hour
and then I'll split! 
 
318
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,200
Yeah. I won't be long.
I'll meet you at home. 

319
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,300
Ok, I see you there. 

320
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,800
OK. 

321
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,900
<i> They say that for every 10 years 
you've been a junkie ...</ i> 

322
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,100
<i>  You will have spent 7 of them 
...waiting. </ i> 

323
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:50,400
<i> One way is not bad 
have as much time to think </ i>. 

324
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:54,500
<i> on the other, the anxiety  
 was a full time job!</ i> 

325
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,800
- Hey? 
- You slimey cunt! 

326
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,300
- What? 
- What do you fucking reckon? 

327
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,300
I just had a quick little bit! 
It was nothing! 

328
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,100
Where? 

329
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,600
Um, In the park. 
When I met Ange. 

330
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,100
Did Angela do it with you? 

331
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,100
No, of course not! 
We left as soon as we did the deal! 

332
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,400
Only because he's decent enough 
to go home to his girlfriend. 
Like you should be!

333
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,900
Oh candy! He sold me the dope! 
Why would he want to have a hit  
in the public toilet? 

334
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,200
Well why the fuck would you?

335
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:36,400
Oww!
Look, I admit it was dumb! 

336
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,400
Okay? 

337
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,400
I'm Sorry! 

338
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,400
Will you let me make you a nice taste! 

339
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,400
I'm getting sick of this, dickhead! 

340
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,400
What is your problem? 

341
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,800
You are my problem! 

342
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,400
You are a waste of space. 

343
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,100
Are you getting your period
or something? 

344
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,200
No, Dan. 

345
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,900
I hardly have my period anymore! 

346
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,500
...because my body's 
all fucked up! 

347
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,900
It's this fucking nightmare 
you've led me into! 

348
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Oh right! Like I held a 
gun to your head! Did I? Eh??

349
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,200
Held you down, hit you up, did I?

350
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,800
Fuck You! 

351
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,400
Fuck you too, Candy! 

352
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,100
Well, Fuck you double then! 

353
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:41,000
Dan, have you noticed, the more 
I work, the less I paint? 

354
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:45,200
Candy, I don't want a fight! OK?

355
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:48,200
I just don't see what your problem is tonight! I mean...

356
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
We've got a life! 

357
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,900
It's neither good nor bad! OK? 

358
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:59,600
Do you know... Do you know what I do? 

359
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,800
Listen to this, dick fuck! 

360
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,700
What do I do all day? 

361
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,400
I fuck men I hate! 

362
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,700
-Don't do this. 
-What are going to do about it? 

363
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,400
Look, Okay, that's it! Alright? 

364
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,500
No more brothels, No more escorts!

365
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,500
-We're gonna take the time to 
start a new life! 
-You don't understand do you?

366
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,600
That's really it this time. 
That's going away!

367
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,400
Maybe I want to keep using! 

368
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,400
You know, I'm sick of working, yes, 
but... 

369
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,400
...What if I want to keep using? 
What are you gonna do about it? 

370
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,600
Candy! 

371
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,600
Why don't you ring gay blokes?

372
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,300
You start working! 
You hock your ass! 

373
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,400
Hey, you know you can not do that! 

374
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,400
You know, I'll get...
I'll get AIDS! 

375
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,200
No you won't, you moron!

376
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,400
You'll make them use condoms, 
like everybody else! 

377
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,500
I wouldn't know what to do. 

378
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:42,800
You're heterosexual, right? So you're
just doing what you're good at anyway. 

379
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,000
Did you even hear what you're saying? 

380
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,000
Let me fuck women, no problems! 

381
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,400
If I can do it with women, I'd make us all the money! You'd never have to work, I swear!

382
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,400
But... These women, they want 
muscle types, don't they? 

383
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:55,100
If there was a market out there, I'd 
do it, but I don't think there is!

384
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,500
And I'd be hopeless with the gay stuff! 
You know that!

385
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,400
You're fucking unbeleivable!

386
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:17,100
I can't get to sleep with that on. 

387
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,400
Can you turn it off? 

388
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,800
Candy, it's a really good movie! 

389
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,500
I'll turn it down, okay? 

390
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Anyway, it finishes in half an hour. 

391
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,500
Fuck you! 

392
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,500
Go to bed. 

393
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
How can you even hear that? 

394
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,600
The light's bugging me! 

395
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,200
<i> I can't believe it. </ i> 

396
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,800
<i> I can't fucking believe it. </ i> 

397
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,300
What? I'm not making any noise. 

398
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,200
The light! 

399
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,600
The Light's keeping me awake. 

400
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,700
OK, look! I'll cover the light! 
Hmm??

401
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:16,800
There's more light coming from the 
workshop than that!

402
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,900
<i> Asshole! </ i> 

403
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,200
<i>The pen!! I can hear the pen 
scratching on the paper! </ i>. 

404
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,600
How? This is ridiculous, Candy. 

405
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,100
You're just looking for an excuse! 

406
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,500
Turn off the light and come to bed. 

407
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,300
I'm not going to discuss this with you anymore! 

408
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,500
Turn the light off! 

409
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,000
Nope! I'm not even talking to you! 

410
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,400
-TURN THE FUCKING LIGHT OFF!! 
-...Aghhh!

411
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
FUCK!! 

412
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Oh my God! Oh my God! 

413
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,100
-Shit. 
-I'm so sorry, Danny! 

414
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,900
-What the fuck was that? 
-Oh my God! Oh baby! Oh shit!

415
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,500
Jesus! It's fuckin' blood! 

416
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,600
I didn't mean to hurt you... 

417
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,500
Jesus fuckin' shit, alright!. 
Fuck!

418
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,400
Is there any chance for some morphine? 

419
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,800
I'm in a fair bit of pain. 

420
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,400
I don't think you need any morphine. 

421
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,300
I don't think you're in 
much pain at all! 

422
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,200
Oh well, it was worth a try! 

423
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:27,300
Excuse me, would you mind if we um, 
bought a couple of flavoured milks off you? 

424
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,900
-Just take a couple. 
-You sure? 

425
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,100
No worries!

426
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,200
-Want some of this? 
-Yeah!

427
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:35,800
-Have a good night! 
-Thanks. 
-Thankyou!

428
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,300
D'you want anymore? 

429
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,200
It's been a while. 

430
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,200
Yeah! It's been a while. 

431
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,900
I'm sorry I hurt your head. 

432
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:29,100
I'll get you back! 

433
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:56,600
Hello.... 
Anybody home? 

434
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,300
Who the fuck are you? 

435
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,000
Yeah, it's me! 
Phil. 

436
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,100
Phillip Dudley, 
from Commercial Realty. 

437
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,600
I've written to you lately. 

438
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:12,500
-What's the problem? 
-Well...

439
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:18,600
We've been writing to you about... 
Um... 

440
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:23,300
I've got these... 
er... hang on...
Er, here they are!

441
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:26,800
Copies of the three letters 
we've sent you recently... 

442
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,700
Relating to the matter of your er,
rent in arrears. 

443
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:38,600
I'm here to confirm that the 3rd of 
these letters is in actual fact a 
notice to vacate. 

444
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,200
Effective 7 days hence. 

445
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,500
Fuck! 

446
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:47,800
Well of course it was...
28 days when you received the letter. 

447
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:52,300
Now, what I'm actually here for today... 

448
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:55,800
is to point out to you the 
shortfall owing on the fault 
of your bond. 

449
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:00,000
Assuming... you've paid no more rent between now and next wednesday... 

450
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,300
We've calculated that the shortfall 
will be er... $1,125. 

451
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,100
Listen, Phillip... 

452
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,300
...we're junkies!

453
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,400
I am a hooker! 

454
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,500
He's hopeless! 

455
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,700
Right now, things are very complicated! 
We haven't got any money. 

456
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Right. 

457
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,000
<i> But it was good...</ i> 

458
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,300
<i> Right when times got tough...</ i> 

459
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,900
<i>There was always Casper. </ i>. 

460
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,800
Ah, the young ones! 

461
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:36,900
Hi! 

462
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:39,100
<i>Our... port in the storm! </ i>. 

463
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,200
Don't get overexcited! 

464
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,400
<i> ...our gingerbread house! </ i> 

465
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:50,100
For once... Here I come...
Bearing Treats! 

466
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:03,100
So is this it? 

467
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,600
An honour student didn't show, 
so I had an idle hour to fill. 

468
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,300
You made that in an hour? 

469
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:11,900
Well... Panadine to morphine, 
in about an hour and 10! 

470
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,000
If you get rid of the paracetamol... 

471
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,100
...do a few things... 

472
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:21,200
...and morphine to heroin in 15 minutes. 

473
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,500
Thankyou, you guys!

474
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,300
Rearrange the atoms... 

475
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,500
...take a bit off... 

476
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,500
...put a bit on... 

477
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,000
Liquid Diamorphine... 

478
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:38,200
Commonly known as heroin, 
pharmaceutical grade, pure. 

479
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,400
I call it "My Yellow Jesus!" 

480
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,200
Papa bear. 

481
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,000
Mama bear. 

482
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,100
Baby bear. 

483
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:36,400
<i>It's just that... Candy says I 
have to start pulling my weight! </ i>

484
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,400
Yeah. 

485
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:48,200
What do you know about gay escorts? 

486
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,300
Growth market. 

487
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:57,500
Would you mind if asked you a few
technical questions? 

488
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,300
There's nothing I'd rather 
discuss with you! 

489
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,400
What do they expect you to do? 

490
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,900
Well there's a big down in the park! 

491
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:14,300
Why don't you pop down 
and do some research!

492
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,800
I mean... 

493
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:23,200
If they pay you, would they 
expect you to have a stiffie? 

494
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,800
It Helps! 

495
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:33,800
I don't think I could manage that. 

496
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,500
I'm just washing my hands. 

497
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,500
Alright! 

498
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,300
He'll cancel his cards. 

499
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,900
Not if I get to him first. 

500
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,400
M. Ro. Roger. Rog. Rogie baby!
Roger, Donald. 

501
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,400
R.D. Here it is! 

502
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,700
R.D. Moylan, 
48 Charles Street, Petersham. 

503
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,800
He'll trace the call. 

504
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,100
That's why they invented 
prepaid phones. 

505
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,200
Ah, Hi! Roger? 

506
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Is that Roger Moylan? 

507
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,400
Yeah, Look! Look, This is hard... 

508
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,900
I'm the guy who stole your wallet. 

509
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,000
Yep! No, hold on! I'm sorry, okay?
That's why I'm calling! I'm really sorry! 

510
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:21,200
I just... I was after some money, 
I saw some cash... and you had none... 

511
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:23,200
I want to give your wallet back! 

512
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:27,600
No, I know! I feel so stupid! 
It's just that I'm... 

513
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,600
I'm so lonely right now... 

514
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,100
I've got no money, 
I've just come from Adelaide...

515
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:34,700
And I've got no friends... 

516
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,900
You know, I saw the wallet on the seat, and I took it! I wasn't thinking! 

517
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:39,800
And I'm not interested in your
credit cards. 

518
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,500
I just want to do the right thing 
and give it back to you. 

519
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,000
Uhh...  Well, no! I mean now's not a good time, I... 

520
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,600
I'm a little bit nervous about 
this whole thing anyway! 

521
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,300
Can we just... 
Let's meet in the morning! 

522
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,300
What... 
What time do you go to work?

523
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,900
So you're in Petersham, right? 

524
00:41:56,900 --> 00:42:00,400
Umm... Isn't there a footie oval down
there or something? 

525
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:03,700
How about we meet out in front of 
the greyhound stand? 

526
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:06,000
9:30? Is that good? 

527
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,300
Well I'll be wearing a 
blue baseball cap! 

528
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:14,500
Look! look, Take my number! 

529
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
You got a pen? 
Yep, Right...

530
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:24,300
- 0422 844 881 
- [That's my Plumber's!] 

531
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:26,300
Yes, 881. 

532
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:30,800
Well, have you got...
a mobile just in case there's a... 

533
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:35,700
Yeah... Yeah! 
Hey, Tell me one thing... 

534
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:39,100
How did you manage to get such a 
cute photo on your license?

535
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:42,400
I'm Sorry! Yeah, I'm sorry, 
I go too far!

536
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,800
Alright! 9:30 then! 
I'll see you then! 

537
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:50,600
Alright, Thanks Rog! 
Okay, bye! 

538
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:56,500
Imagine if you'd turned your powers 
to the benefit of mankind... Dan!

539
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,300
Does this look like me? 

540
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,800
Not even remotely. 

541
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I could use these! 

542
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,500
And a bit of... 

543
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
...How about now? 

544
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,800
Caucasian man with glasses. 

545
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,500
Yes! 

546
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:26,300
I felt like Tarzan, 
at fuckin' last! 

547
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:29,100
I had to hunt down some 
food for Jane. 

548
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,900
I knew it was in my power 
to do something brave. 

549
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,600
Yeah... 

550
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:26,600
Can we talk about this 
when you get back to the office? 

551
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,800
20 minutes... Okay, bye!

552
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,700
Sorry about that! 

553
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:32,000
Good morning, 
How are you? 

554
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,600
Ah, good! 
How are you?

555
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,200
Good. 

556
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,700
I just uh, wanted to check my 
current balance on this please! 

557
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:40,300
Okay, I'll just need to get you to
enter in your PIN... 

558
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:45,300
Oh God, I'm... 
terrible with this! 

559
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:49,200
God! Do you ever have trouble 
remembering your PIN? 

560
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:52,900
You'd be surprised at the number of 
people who forget them. 

561
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:55,400
Yeah I know! 
That's why I came inside... 

562
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,300
Because I couldn't remember it 
out at the ATM, and I thought... 

563
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:00,000
You know I could just er.. 
If I had ID? 

564
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,900
No! I'm sorry, you need your PIN 
number for all transactions. It's...

565
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:06,600
It's one of those security things! 

566
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,700
No! Of course, of course! 
I understand. Um...

567
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:11,900
So you can't just... 

568
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:13,500
I really can't!

569
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,300
Hello? 

570
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:21,300
-Mr. Moylan?
-Yes?

571
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,500
-Mr. Roger Moylan? 
-Yes?

572
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:28,300
Roger Moylan, This is Ewan Douglas 
from the Commonwealth Bank 
Security division... 

573
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:31,200
Yes? Is something the matter?

574
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:36,300
We've been tracking some unusual 
activity on your credit card, in   
the last 24 hours...

575
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:37,300
Oh no! 

576
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:39,800
When was the last time 
you used your Master Card? 

577
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:44,000
Um, look! I think my wallet was 
stolen last night... 

578
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,600
Did you report it missing? 

579
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,800
I was just calling now!

580
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,300
<i> But I called you. </ i> 

581
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:53,000
Um, I mean I was about to call. 

582
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:58,400
Sir, Mr. Moylan, I'm going to have to 
verify your details for a security check. 

583
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,500
Would you please tell me your 
Date of Birth?

584
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:03,400
Um... 13th of March, 1977. 

585
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,800
Mother's Maiden Name? 

586
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,700
Er, Lynch. 

587
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:09,200
Number of security? 

588
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:13,200
Is that like your PIN number? 

589
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:17,400
Well, it shouldn't be... 
but you often find that it is! 

590
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:23,000
Umm...
Try... 3279 

591
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,900
3279

592
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:42,300
It's just one of those days, you know... where everythings just gone! 

593
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,500
It happens all the time! 

594
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:47,500
Um, but listen... I've already got my daily limit out from the ATM outside... 

595
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:51,500
...But I actually need more, because 
I'm trying to buy this beautiful old Mercedes....

596
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:53,100
...you know, the cream ones, 
you know, the TLS? 

597
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:55,500
Anyway, the guy's willing to negotiate for cash... 

598
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:04,200
...$2247. 

599
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,800
God, we're going to be 
in the poor house! 

600
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
...and 50 cents.

601
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,800
Never get sentimental about a car! 

602
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:19,600
I might just get you to check the 
available credit on this card...

603
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
I can get a cash advance, can't I? 

604
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:27,900
Candy? Candy! 

605
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:29,900
I did it! I did it! 
I fucking did it, baby! 

606
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:33,600
I fucking did it! 

607
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,400
God, You... are going to fucking LOVE me for this...

608
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,200
7 Grand!! 

609
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,500
Oh god! You should have seen it! 
I was fucking great! It was like...

610
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
It was like that movie 
we saw with that...

611
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,700
God, what was his name, 
that actor we like?

612
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:48,400
...and he gets all that money,  
and he walks in and he's all coool, 
and stuf like that... 
-Danny!

613
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:56,400
I'm pregnant. 

614
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:59,600
Shit. 

615
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Candy. 

616
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:16,100
Crap. 

617
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,300
It couldn't be, uh... 

618
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:24,900
No. 

619
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,200
We never broke a condom. 

620
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:30,300
I'd know. 

621
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:32,900
It was the night 
I broke your skull. 

622
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:37,200
How fucking weird. 

623
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:39,600
One night. 

624
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,200
I can get an abortion. 

625
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,000
No. 

626
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,400
No, no way! 

627
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:52,700
This is good. 

628
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,200
It was meant to be. 

629
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:57,900
This is what we need. 

630
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
We've got to stop using. 

631
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:07,600
Yeah. 

632
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,200
Yeah, of course. 

633
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:20,600
Sugar? 

634
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,200
Two, please. 

635
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,600
We've got some news everybody... 

636
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:32,600
We're having a baby. 

637
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:41,500
Ah, Darling! 

638
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:24,500
Candice, Good God. 

639
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:34,400
We just wanted you to know that 
we've made some decisions. and uh... 

640
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:37,100
We've been putting some money aside,
haven't we? 

641
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:40,000
We're going to get out of that 
whole warehouse environment. 

642
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:42,100
...and live in a proper house. 

643
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,300
Yeah! We really want to raise 
our child in the.... 

644
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:47,500
...in a proper home. 

645
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,400
Have you told your parents? 

646
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:54,000
No. 

647
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:59,300
Day 1 

648
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:04,900
We knew what we had 
to do. 

649
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:09,100
It takes alot of planning to stop. 

650
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:15,700
Lucky at last! 
We can really do this, Candy. 

651
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:19,300
It's going to be hard, but... 

652
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,400
I'm sure it's like a bridge... 

653
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,900
And once we cross it, 
everything will be okay. 

654
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:30,700
You can get back into your 
painting again...

655
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:33,100
Maybe we'll move to the country... 

656
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:35,300
Grow some veggies... 

657
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:36,700
Feed the chickens... 

658
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:41,100
We could go live in Thailand...

659
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:48,800
Thailand would be great, 
if we didn't use. 

660
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,800
Or the Himalayas. 

661
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:55,500
We'll go canoeing... 

662
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,600
A bit of white water rafting... 

663
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:05,500
Get healthy, sleep well... 

664
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:08,600
...not have drugs in our system. 

665
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,400
How good would that be? 

666
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,800
We really have to do this. 

667
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:23,900
We have to do it this time. 

668
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:26,300
Yeah, we will. 

669
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:29,300
We are. 

670
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:32,700
We're really fuckin' doing it! 

671
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:37,400
Day 2 

672
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:46,900
Day 4 

673
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:56,300
I can't do it. 

674
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:58,900
I can't do it. 

675
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:01,200
Hey! 
Come back to bed. 

676
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:03,400
Alright? You'll catch a cold. 

677
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:31,400
Casper, It's Candy. 

678
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:33,100
Ring me as soon as you get this. 

679
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:35,300
We've tried your mobile. 

680
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:41,100
I know we said to ignore us while
we did this, but... 

681
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:42,600
3 days... 

682
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:47,400
...we did pretty well, but 
we're not feeling so great now. 

683
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:49,800
We don't want you to ignore us now. 

684
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:53,600
Are you there? 

685
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:57,100
Pick up if you're there. 

686
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:00,200
Pick up! 

687
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:04,900
Okay, you're not there.

688
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:06,500
Call us!! 

689
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:07,700
Shit! Shit! 

690
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:09,700
Shit! Shit! Shit! 

691
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:17,500
Kojak? It's Candy! 

692
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:22,400
Um... Shit, not so good. 

693
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:25,500
I'm really sick. I mean... 

694
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:27,600
We just need credit. 

695
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:30,200
Uh... I can work a shift, 
and then I can pay you back. 

696
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:34,800
Yeah, well if I work a shift, 
then I can pay that too. 

697
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:38,800
I can't work when I'm this sick! 

698
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:42,500
Ok, bye. 

699
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:44,800
Fucking cunt!! 

700
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:48,200
Candy. 

701
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:53,600
-Candy. 
-Oh God!

702
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:55,600
Answer!
Answer, please! 

703
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:02,100
He was just about to answer!

704
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:10,300
-Give me the phone. 
-I want the fucking phone!

705
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:11,300
Don't fucking take it away from me! 
No! No!!

706
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:18,900
-We can do it. 
-No! Get away!! Nooooo!!

707
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:20,900
Candy, you're bleeding. 

708
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:22,600
Candy, you're bleeding. 

709
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:24,700
Why are you bleeding? 

710
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:33,600
The water has broken.
Her cervix has dilated. 

711
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:36,100
This is what we didn't 
want to happen. 

712
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:39,200
We call this an 
inevitable miscarriage. 

713
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,200
There's no going back. 

714
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:45,100
As I was explaining to Candy, 
she's going to have to go through 
a kind of... labour! 

715
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:49,500
I don't know however long that takes, you need to know that at this state of
the pregnancy... 

716
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:51,200
...the baby is not going to survive. 

717
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:54,000
I'm Sorry. 

718
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:36,200
Give me pethidine! 

719
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:37,700
I want pethidine! 

720
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:39,800
Will you give her the fucking 
pethidine, or what? 

721
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:42,200
She's fucking in pain, 
can't you see this?

722
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:57,800
That's it! Candy, push! 

723
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:01,200
Almost there! 
Push! 
That's it!!

724
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:25,500
Can I hold it? 

725
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:43,500
Doctor, it's leg moved. 

726
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:44,900
It's just a spasm. 

727
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:45,700
It moved! 

728
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:47,700
It's just a spasm. 

729
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:52,800
Hell 

730
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:37,900
-How much did you get? 
-50. 

731
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:41,800
That guy is still back there. 

732
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,600
-Maybe you'll sell some. Yeah?
-Alright. 

733
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,200
<i>Everything we ever did...</ i> 

734
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:53,700
<i> we did with the best 
of intentions... </ i> 

735
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:58,300
<i> But.. events tumble!
and the years pile up.</ i> 

736
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:02,700
<i> The world is very bewildering 
to a junkie. </ i> 

737
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:07,800
Yeah, we're all good!

738
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:22,100
-Well... Tastes bad. 
-Fuck!

739
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:24,100
Here you go. 

740
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:28,400
Do you feel anything? 

741
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:30,600
No. 

742
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:36,400
-Shit! 
-Shit!

743
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:45,900
<i> and still... you cling to
 the concept of change. </ i> 

744
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:57,200
Hey, Schumann... 

745
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:59,500
...we are thinking of moving 
up the country for a while. 

746
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:01,200
Give methadone a try. 

747
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:05,600
What the fuck difference 
would it make? 

748
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:16,400
The air's cleaner, for one. 

749
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:13,200
It's a kitchen. 

750
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:22,100
It's a bit dark, isn't it?

751
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:23,100
Yeah. 

752
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:26,100
Yeah, we Could um... 

753
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:31,100
knock out a hole...
and put a skylight. 

754
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:50,000
I love you. 

755
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:25,100
Any frozen peas? 

756
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:27,100
No. 

757
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:31,000
I got one!
There he is! 

758
01:07:31,700 --> 01:07:33,700
It was all the way down 
in the turbo frost.

759
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:43,900
I can not believe you didn't do 
this, this morning. 

760
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:46,200
What time are they coming? 

761
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:47,900
Fuck!! 

762
01:08:03,100 --> 01:08:04,600
What's the date? 

763
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:07,000
Oh no, this expired a month ago. 

764
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:12,400
Look at that! It smells bad!

765
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:14,900
-That's got that kind of chicken smell!
-Yeah it does doesn't it!

766
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:20,900
Not to worry, we'll just 
baste it in lots of stuff!
Like uh... 

767
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:22,900
Basil, uh... honey?
Bayleaves or something?

768
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:25,300
What's in the cupboard?

769
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
What do you put on a roast? 

770
01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:35,800
How long did it take you to 
get out here? 

771
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:38,300
Oh, About an hour and 40 minutes? 
Dear?

772
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:44,600
Yeah, about... 40? 45? 

773
01:08:47,700 --> 01:08:49,200
Much traffic? 

774
01:08:49,300 --> 01:08:51,300
No, pretty good run really. 

775
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:53,600
Can't complain. 

776
01:08:55,700 --> 01:08:58,300
It's so beautiful here, 
the drive down was so beautiful.

777
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:01,500
Yeah, it's... 
Countryside. 

778
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:07,700
Had any news on the job front? 

779
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:13,700
Um... Well it's pretty... 
There's not much work around here. 
We're getting by on the dole.

780
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:17,100
Well, apparently I might be able to 
get some work hay bailing. 

781
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:19,700
Hay bailing? 

782
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:22,300
-Ooooh! Tough work, hay bailing! 
-Yeah.

783
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:28,200
So! What can I do in the kitchen? 

784
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:30,200
Nothing mum, really! 
It's fine!

785
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:31,800
Nonsense, there must be something 
I can do to help. 

786
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:33,600
Everything's under control. 

787
01:09:33,900 --> 01:09:35,400
The oven's heating up. 

788
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:39,900
We're running a bit behind.

789
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:41,500
<i> No worries, mate. </ i> 

790
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:46,100
Oh This is unbelievable. 
You go to all this trouble 
to invite us up here... 

791
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:49,400
...and you can't even manage the 
simple decency of getting the meal 
together on time!

792
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:51,000
Get off my case, mum! 

793
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,300
Is not food that's even the issue here.

794
01:09:52,300 --> 01:09:53,600
It's your attitude! 

795
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,100
Okay, let's just calm down. 
Lunch will be ready in less than an hour. 

796
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:57,100
Who wants some wine? 

797
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:00,600
That chicken is rock solid! 

798
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:03,000
We're not going to be eating before 
midnight. 

799
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:04,300
And where are the vegetables? 

800
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:05,300
Hey hey, Let's all calm down, honey. 

801
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
What do you think is about? 

802
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:11,500
Sunday Lunch. 
It's a pretty simple thing. 

803
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:14,300
But with you two, there's no 
such thing as simple. 

804
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:15,600
The drugs! 

805
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:18,600
The drugs always come first. 

806
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:20,600
Hey no, that is not true. 

807
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:22,800
We're doing really well now. 

808
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:26,500
Do you have any idea... 

809
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:31,600
...what you have done to my family? 

810
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:34,900
To me? 

811
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:39,300
What happened to that beautiful girl? 

812
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:41,800
What happened? 

813
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
What happened? 

814
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:46,600
Can't you see? 

815
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:49,600
Don't you understand? 

816
01:10:50,100 --> 01:10:55,100
I have been clutching my fucking fists
since I was 6 years old. 

817
01:10:56,100 --> 01:10:58,100
Look at my fucking fists!
Look at them! 

818
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:02,500
Look at them, you fucking bitch! 

819
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:04,900
Don't you understand? 

820
01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:08,800
No! I gotta clench my hands!

821
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:12,400
I gotta clench my hands! 
I can't relax. 

822
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:18,700
Darling, darling! Look!
It's been a big move. 

823
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:19,700
It's been a big year. 

824
01:11:20,300 --> 01:11:21,500
There's been lots of changes. 

825
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:24,400
C'mon, you've lost a child.

826
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:27,300
But you ARE getting your lives together. 
I can see that!

827
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:30,100
Just go. 

828
01:11:31,100 --> 01:11:32,300
Fuck off. 

829
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:35,100
Forget lunch. 

830
01:11:38,300 --> 01:11:40,300
Can we? 

831
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:42,800
Can we cancel the lunch? 

832
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:45,500
Maybe we can just make 
this another day. 

833
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:49,600
Today is just a bad day. 
I'm sorry. 

834
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:01,900
I'm scared. 

835
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
There's nothing to be scared of. 

836
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:13,600
There's nothing to be scared of. 

837
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:21,500
D'you think we're going to end? 

838
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:26,100
-We'll never end. 
-It'll end.

839
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:36,200
It's not gonna work. 

840
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,600
Is that the flu vaccine? 

841
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:55,600
It's medicine. 

842
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
It's leading us not into temptation. 

843
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:05,800
Hey Candy, check out this. 

844
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:07,700
Brickie's labourer.

845
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:10,100
-I'll give it a call, eh. 
-Why don't you do that. 

846
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:12,400
-Hi. 
-Hey!

847
01:14:18,900 --> 01:14:20,900
This is Paul. 
He lives up the road. 

848
01:14:23,900 --> 01:14:25,900
Good day. 

849
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:28,200
He's got some good home grow. 

850
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:30,200
Great. 
Can I get some more? 

851
01:14:32,700 --> 01:14:34,700
Um... There is none left. 

852
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:43,400
Then I'll grab a beer. 

853
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:45,000
There's none of that either. 

854
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:52,500
I'm gonna go and get some more pot. 

855
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:55,800
Uh.. We gonna grab some dinner, 
or What? 

856
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:57,500
No, you eat! I'll be fine. 

857
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:01,100
You want some money? 
I got paid. 

858
01:15:01,100 --> 01:15:02,800
-No. 
-No, it's okay mate. 

859
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:04,800
Where were you? 

860
01:16:05,100 --> 01:16:07,100
Don't you fuck this one with 
your negative comments. 

861
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:11,800
What are you doing? 

862
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:13,600
Going back to my art. 

863
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:15,700
Does not mean anything to you? 

864
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Have you been fuckingt that guy? 

865
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:22,500
You do not know what 
you're talking about. 

866
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:24,500
Where have you been all night? 

867
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:26,300
Away from you. 

868
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:30,200
You fucked him, didn't you? 

869
01:16:34,700 --> 01:16:36,700
Firstly... 

870
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:39,400
...You do not know what 
you're talking about. 

871
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:42,600
Secondly... 

872
01:16:41,900 --> 01:16:43,900
...I hate the sound of your voice. 

873
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:46,300
Thirdly... 

874
01:16:47,300 --> 01:16:48,800
...Why don't you just fuck off? 

875
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:54,200
I mean, really! 

876
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:57,500
Fuck off! 

877
01:17:19,900 --> 01:17:22,700
Wakey wakey. 
Hands off snakey!

878
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
What the fuck is that? 

879
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,200
A statement of fact. 
What do you think it is? 

880
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:31,200
And what's this with your mother anyway?

881
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:35,200
Well if it's not her... 

882
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:36,000
...Then you. 

883
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:37,200
Great. 

884
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:39,500
Okay, 
...You. 

885
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:49,900
You think you're so smart, 
but youre just fuckin' mad! 

886
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,400
That's really good, Candy. 

887
01:17:55,900 --> 01:17:57,400
That's good, glad you think that. 

888
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:10,500
Your a fuckin' poet! 

889
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:34,500
<i> Once upon a time, there was
 a Candy and Dan... </ i>

Get out.

I suppose I should do just that. 

931

01:27:30,900 --> 01:27:32,900
I was so frightened. 

943
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
Sorry. 

944
01:27:37,300 --> 01:27:39,300
I didn't really understand 
what was happening. 

945
01:27:45,700 --> 01:27:47,700
Candy? 

946
01:27:54,100 --> 01:27:56,100
Everything's dead. 

947
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:02,600
Everything's turning blue. 

948
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:32,400
It's hard through all this you know. 

949
01:28:37,500 --> 01:28:40,700
I don't care how wrong you've 
been living about your years. 

950
01:28:40,700 --> 01:28:58,400
I care about my daughter. 

951
01:28:59,300 --> 01:29:01,300
What? 

952
01:29:01,900 --> 01:29:03,900
Whatever you're capable of...
whatever she needs...

953
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:09,600
Come on, we'll take you home. 

954
01:29:35,300 --> 01:29:37,300
Let him go. 

955
01:31:25,500 --> 01:31:27,500
<i>And that was it... </ i> 

956
01:31:28,100 --> 01:31:30,100
<i>That was all that was 
scattered to the winds... </ i>. 

957
01:31:31,100 --> 01:31:33,100
<i>Casper was gone... </ i> 

958
01:31:33,300 --> 01:31:35,300
<i> Schumann was lost... </ i> 

959
01:31:35,700 --> 01:31:38,100
<i> Candy was off getting better... </ i> 

960
01:31:38,500 --> 01:31:40,500
<i> The coast... </ i> 

961
01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:42,300
<i> Rehab... </ i> 

962
01:31:42,300 --> 01:31:43,700
<i> And I...
Was...</ i> 

963
01:31:43,700 --> 01:31:46,300
<i>
I was just...</ i> 

964
01:31:46,700 --> 01:31:47,800
The washer, Dan. 

965
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:49,400
World Championship washer. 

966
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:52,100
One day, you'll wash for Australia. 

967
01:31:54,100 --> 01:31:56,900
<i> The world was full of 
startling new concepts. </ i> 

968
01:31:59,400 --> 01:32:03,300
<i> I couldn't think. 
I couldn't breathe. </ I> 

969
01:32:04,300 --> 01:32:06,300
<i>I was waiting for her 
to come back. </ i> 

970
01:32:07,300 --> 01:32:09,300
<i> Because she was everything. </ i> 

971
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:13,200
<i> She was everything to me. </ i> 

972
01:32:16,700 --> 01:32:18,700
Hey Dan, you have a visitor. 

973
01:32:19,100 --> 01:32:21,100
Visit. 

974
01:32:32,700 --> 01:32:34,700
Just Tell her I'm not here. 

975
01:32:34,700 --> 01:32:36,000
Are you crazy? 

976
01:32:36,100 --> 01:32:38,100
Tell her I knocked off. 

977
01:32:41,900 --> 01:32:44,400
Your friend is right here,
just come. 

978
01:32:55,100 --> 01:32:57,100
-G'day. 
-Hey!

979
01:33:04,900 --> 01:33:06,900
I thought it was tomorrow. 

980
01:33:08,700 --> 01:33:10,700
I couldn't wait. 

981
01:33:12,100 --> 01:33:13,500
Is that okay? 

982
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
Yeah! No, it's good! 

983
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
It's just! 
You look so beautiful. 

984
01:33:23,500 --> 01:33:25,500
It's all that country air.

985
01:33:27,200 --> 01:33:29,200
So I finish in an hour.

986
01:34:38,500 --> 01:34:40,500
Dan. 

987
01:34:42,900 --> 01:34:44,900
Dan. Hey!
Hey!

988
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:57,100
Danny, Danny! Hey!

989
01:34:57,100 --> 01:35:00,900
It's Okay. 
Hey!

990
01:35:00,900 --> 01:35:03,400
Hey, It's Okay, 
I'm here now. 

991
01:35:17,500 --> 01:35:20,000
There's no going back. 

992
01:35:27,700 --> 01:35:30,500
If you're given a repreive... 

993
01:35:30,500 --> 01:35:35,000
I think it is good to remember... 

994
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:41,500
...just how thin it is.

995
01:35:42,500 --> 01:35:52,500
