1
00:00:41,698 --> 00:00:43,127
Can I play?

2
00:00:43,234 --> 00:00:45,721
Do you have any marbles?

3
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:47,386
Yep.

4
00:00:49,089 --> 00:00:50,616
OK.

5
00:00:50,689 --> 00:00:51,800
Thanks.

6
00:00:51,872 --> 00:00:53,247
You're welcome.

7
00:00:53,312 --> 00:00:54,622
So, what's your name?

8
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:56,118
Louis. Yours?

9
00:00:56,193 --> 00:00:57,566
Alan.

10
00:00:57,633 --> 00:00:59,900
You're not from around here,
are you?

11
00:00:59,966 --> 00:01:03,282
No. I'm here with my parents
for the day.

12
00:01:08,317 --> 00:01:09,779
What?

13
00:01:09,885 --> 00:01:11,925
What's over there?

14
00:01:23,227 --> 00:01:25,431
Don't do that. We're not
even allowed to be here.

15
00:01:33,433 --> 00:01:34,961
Come on.

16
00:01:35,034 --> 00:01:36,594
Wait for me.

17
00:01:45,942 --> 00:01:48,114
Let's go back down.

18
00:01:48,184 --> 00:01:49,938
Nope.

19
00:01:51,318 --> 00:01:52,430
Don't!

20
00:02:05,173 --> 00:02:06,285
Alan, don't!

21
00:02:11,986 --> 00:02:14,059
See? That wasn't so bad.

22
00:02:14,163 --> 00:02:15,536
Just don't look down.

23
00:02:19,122 --> 00:02:20,266
Louis!

24
00:02:22,672 --> 00:02:24,233
Come on.

25
00:02:31,342 --> 00:02:33,676
See? It's steady.

26
00:02:52,813 --> 00:02:54,787
- Louis!
- I can't move!

27
00:02:54,858 --> 00:02:56,451
Come on!

28
00:02:58,347 --> 00:03:01,826
Alan, help!

29
00:03:04,202 --> 00:03:06,144
Wait!

30
00:06:30,664 --> 00:06:32,518
Here it comes. Just relax.

31
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:34,109
You're doing great now.

32
00:06:34,182 --> 00:06:36,996
All right.
Now, just a couple more seconds.

33
00:06:37,061 --> 00:06:38,916
Here it comes, sweetie.

34
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:40,671
Just keep breathing.

35
00:06:40,741 --> 00:06:43,393
All right, the head's crowning.
Very good.

36
00:06:43,462 --> 00:06:44,770
Excellent. Here we go.

37
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:46,364
One more big push, sweetie.

38
00:06:46,438 --> 00:06:48,771
That's it. Now breathe.

39
00:06:48,836 --> 00:06:50,690
It's coming.

40
00:06:50,756 --> 00:06:53,122
Push, push, push!

41
00:06:55,554 --> 00:06:57,244
Oh, here we go.

42
00:06:57,347 --> 00:07:00,193
We have a boy.

43
00:07:02,785 --> 00:07:04,639
Oh, is he OK?

44
00:07:04,705 --> 00:07:07,041
- He's perfect.
- He's fine. He's fine.

45
00:07:07,106 --> 00:07:08,959
A beautiful son.

46
00:07:09,025 --> 00:07:11,871
Beautiful. He's beautiful.

47
00:07:17,983 --> 00:07:19,989
- Are we OK?
- He's fine, honey.

48
00:07:20,062 --> 00:07:22,484
- He's beautiful.
- Oh, he's perfect.

49
00:07:22,558 --> 00:07:25,111
Congratulations, Dad.

50
00:07:25,182 --> 00:07:26,874
Here he comes.

51
00:07:26,942 --> 00:07:28,794
You did really well.

52
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:33,084
Oh, hi. Oh, it's OK.

53
00:07:33,148 --> 00:07:36,280
Beautiful baby boy.
You did really well.

54
00:07:36,349 --> 00:07:38,715
He's got his eyes open.
He's looking at you.

55
00:07:38,812 --> 00:07:41,561
- What's his name?
- Danny.

56
00:07:58,775 --> 00:08:00,433
Danny.

57
00:08:00,504 --> 00:08:03,472
Danny, come here, sweetie.
Get away from the ants.

58
00:08:07,256 --> 00:08:09,141
See, we have the best-fed ants
in the neighborhood.

59
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:10,581
Come on.

60
00:08:10,646 --> 00:08:12,305
Have to do that later.

61
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:14,546
Jason, my guys took
your guy's gun.

62
00:08:14,614 --> 00:08:16,786
Can't.
It's attached to his leg. See?

63
00:08:16,853 --> 00:08:18,414
Oh, my God.

64
00:08:18,486 --> 00:08:20,656
That's me, man.

65
00:08:22,133 --> 00:08:23,377
That's me.

66
00:08:23,445 --> 00:08:25,812
Danny, play nice
with your brother.

67
00:08:25,877 --> 00:08:28,844
What's that music you're using?
I really dig it.

68
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:35,628
Whatever it is,
it's terrific, man.

69
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:37,868
It really...

70
00:08:37,971 --> 00:08:40,272
I don't know...

71
00:08:40,338 --> 00:08:42,509
suits his life somehow.

72
00:08:42,577 --> 00:08:44,998
So, Danny, you still drawing?

73
00:08:45,073 --> 00:08:46,187
Nope.

74
00:08:46,257 --> 00:08:49,672
No? Didn't you want to grow up
to be an artist?

75
00:08:52,016 --> 00:08:53,542
That's some
of the opening sequence.

76
00:08:53,614 --> 00:08:56,297
The rest needs
some fixes and tweaks.

77
00:08:56,367 --> 00:08:58,855
But right now, he's clocking in
at one hour and 40 minutes.

78
00:08:58,927 --> 00:09:00,781
Yeah, that's cool.

79
00:09:02,093 --> 00:09:04,264
I just wanted to have a look...

80
00:09:04,332 --> 00:09:05,826
before the Rememory tomorrow.

81
00:09:05,901 --> 00:09:07,428
You know.

82
00:09:07,533 --> 00:09:09,541
You've done a hell of a job
with him, Mr. Hakman.

83
00:09:09,645 --> 00:09:11,498
You've done
the son of a bitch right.

84
00:09:11,562 --> 00:09:13,090
You're welcome.

85
00:09:15,564 --> 00:09:17,319
I don't suppose...

86
00:09:17,387 --> 00:09:19,656
There was a fishing trip
when we were 13.

87
00:09:19,724 --> 00:09:21,216
Just Danny and I and Dad...

88
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:23,428
- At the cape.
- Yes, that one.

89
00:09:23,498 --> 00:09:25,768
My God,
that day is still with me.

90
00:09:25,835 --> 00:09:28,071
You requested it specifically.
It's there.

91
00:09:28,137 --> 00:09:30,559
Well, I'll be off, then.

92
00:09:43,269 --> 00:09:46,499
Closing Zoe project
D. Monroe, rough cut 6.

93
00:09:49,542 --> 00:09:53,218
Opening D. Monroe, scene 127-Q.

94
00:09:53,285 --> 00:09:54,746
Jesus Christ!

95
00:09:54,821 --> 00:09:57,309
I told you to shut up!

96
00:09:57,381 --> 00:10:00,347
Danny! Danny, stop!

97
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,753
You...

98
00:10:02,819 --> 00:10:05,949
You deserve this, bitch!

99
00:10:06,018 --> 00:10:07,479
No!

100
00:10:07,555 --> 00:10:10,751
No! God! Please... please...

101
00:10:10,851 --> 00:10:14,200
No! Stop! No! You're killing me!

102
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:16,602
Stop!

103
00:10:19,426 --> 00:10:22,491
Scene 127-Q deleted.

104
00:10:32,447 --> 00:10:34,388
EYE Tech introduces...

105
00:10:34,462 --> 00:10:36,795
the ninth generation
of the Zoe implant...

106
00:10:36,861 --> 00:10:39,065
from our family to yours.

107
00:10:39,134 --> 00:10:41,173
Do you think
we'll be able to afford one?

108
00:10:41,245 --> 00:10:43,033
Yep.

109
00:10:43,133 --> 00:10:44,377
I hope so.

110
00:10:44,476 --> 00:10:48,786
Well, we can save.
It's worth it, I think.

111
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:07,732
Excuse me.

112
00:11:35,733 --> 00:11:38,994
This girl was a complete wreck.

113
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,907
Drinking, drugs,
in and out of schools.

114
00:11:41,973 --> 00:11:43,249
Then she turns 21...

115
00:11:43,316 --> 00:11:46,216
and she finds out
about her Zoe implant.

116
00:11:46,323 --> 00:11:48,657
Complete 180. She's born again.

117
00:11:48,722 --> 00:11:51,537
Her knowing that
someone would one day watch...

118
00:11:51,602 --> 00:11:55,856
transforms her into this kind,
gentle, loving person.

119
00:11:55,921 --> 00:11:57,928
So, what happened?

120
00:11:58,001 --> 00:11:59,692
She committed suicide.

121
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:01,769
Took a dive off her balcony...

122
00:12:01,842 --> 00:12:05,637
twenty-seven floors
straight onto her head.

123
00:12:05,711 --> 00:12:07,436
The implant
was instantly vaporized.

124
00:12:07,503 --> 00:12:10,185
Charming story, Hasan.
Please do go on.

125
00:12:10,255 --> 00:12:12,808
Alan!
This is a rare treat.

126
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:14,188
Alan!

127
00:12:14,255 --> 00:12:16,589
Michael, this is Alan Hakman.

128
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:17,733
- Hi.
- Hi.

129
00:12:17,838 --> 00:12:19,364
It's an honor to meet you.

130
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:21,160
Mike is my new assistant.

131
00:12:21,262 --> 00:12:22,439
What happened to Eddie?

132
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:25,159
Eddie freaked out on me.
Strung too tight.

133
00:12:25,229 --> 00:12:27,715
Hey, Alan, have you seen these?

134
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:29,511
They are all over town.

135
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:32,895
These anti-Zoe hippies always
seemed a little crazy to me.

136
00:12:32,972 --> 00:12:36,680
But now they just seem crazy.

137
00:12:36,747 --> 00:12:38,852
Listen...

138
00:12:38,923 --> 00:12:42,499
"It is not our place to see
through other people's eyes.

139
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:46,660
"That is for God and God alone."

140
00:12:46,729 --> 00:12:49,630
Anyway, how's
the Monroe project coming?

141
00:12:49,703 --> 00:12:50,882
Fine.

142
00:12:50,985 --> 00:12:53,471
- Just fine?
- Just fine.

143
00:12:53,576 --> 00:12:56,161
Michael,
it's your great privilege...

144
00:12:56,232 --> 00:12:57,408
to meet this man.

145
00:12:57,478 --> 00:12:58,788
He's the best cutter in town.

146
00:12:58,854 --> 00:13:01,123
- Who's your assistant?
- I don't have an assistant.

147
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:04,006
I have a friend that's looking
to get into the racket.

148
00:13:04,071 --> 00:13:06,144
I don't work with an assistant.

149
00:13:07,141 --> 00:13:08,668
You have
something for me, Thelma?

150
00:13:08,741 --> 00:13:09,951
Straight to business.

151
00:13:10,021 --> 00:13:12,804
I got a job last week
that I passed on...

152
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,560
and I think
it's right up your alley.

153
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:16,320
You know Charles Bannister?

154
00:13:16,389 --> 00:13:18,592
His widow
is looking for a cutter.

155
00:13:18,661 --> 00:13:19,868
Bannister, the EYE Tech lawyer?

156
00:13:19,938 --> 00:13:22,623
He was out jogging
and his heart collapsed.

157
00:13:22,722 --> 00:13:24,697
Wait a minute.
EYE Tech let that footage out?

158
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:26,974
Jennifer Bannister
won the lawsuit against them...

159
00:13:27,043 --> 00:13:28,864
and claimed
her husband's implant.

160
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:30,686
She insisted on having
her own cutter, too.

161
00:13:30,753 --> 00:13:32,575
And with good reason.

162
00:13:32,641 --> 00:13:34,049
We could have taken that job.

163
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:35,673
After Caldwell,
our schedule is wide open.

164
00:13:35,745 --> 00:13:37,655
I don't like the ugly stuff.

165
00:13:37,729 --> 00:13:39,004
It gives me nightmares.

166
00:13:39,073 --> 00:13:41,723
And this pig Bannister...

167
00:13:41,792 --> 00:13:44,890
he's human garbage.

168
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,602
I took one look at the footage
and sent it straight back.

169
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:52,826
She only hired me because
you were busy with Monroe.

170
00:13:52,893 --> 00:13:54,420
It's you she really wants.

171
00:13:54,527 --> 00:13:56,380
- I'm available.
- Good.

172
00:13:56,446 --> 00:13:57,722
Our friend Alan...

173
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,731
that's his specialty,
so to speak.

174
00:13:59,836 --> 00:14:02,552
If you can't bear
to look at it, he will.

175
00:14:02,621 --> 00:14:04,311
I'll tell her
you'll come by tomorrow.

176
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,787
She'll be expecting you.

177
00:14:08,187 --> 00:14:09,593
We should actually go.

178
00:14:09,659 --> 00:14:11,348
Oh, yes.
Rememory is in two days...

179
00:14:11,419 --> 00:14:13,274
and we're still cutting picture.

180
00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:15,194
Goddamn last-minute jobs.

181
00:14:15,258 --> 00:14:17,625
Thelma, come on.
It keeps you young.

182
00:14:17,689 --> 00:14:19,379
Alan.

183
00:14:21,018 --> 00:14:22,392
Hasan.

184
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:25,903
Oh, hey, Alan.
I've been working on...

185
00:14:26,008 --> 00:14:28,016
this new sorting program
for the Guillotine...

186
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,990
and I would really love
to get your feedback on it.

187
00:14:31,095 --> 00:14:32,501
Maybe another time.

188
00:14:35,703 --> 00:14:37,907
Yeah, maybe some other time.

189
00:14:55,573 --> 00:14:57,427
Put it in archives very gently.

190
00:14:57,523 --> 00:14:58,668
- Sure.
- All right.

191
00:14:58,771 --> 00:15:01,257
Delila,
is suicide under self-help?

192
00:15:03,251 --> 00:15:04,495
What are you doing here?

193
00:15:04,563 --> 00:15:07,246
I just wanted to talk.

194
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:10,097
I'm busy.

195
00:15:13,169 --> 00:15:16,299
Store's still open.
It's the 11:30 rush.

196
00:15:16,368 --> 00:15:18,572
Books are flying off the shelf.

197
00:15:24,622 --> 00:15:26,988
We close in 20 minutes.

198
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:37,674
This is exciting.

199
00:15:37,741 --> 00:15:39,147
You've never had me over before.

200
00:15:39,212 --> 00:15:41,068
You've always
wanted to see my work.

201
00:15:41,134 --> 00:15:42,822
Well, you're always working.

202
00:15:42,891 --> 00:15:45,891
I'm curious about
what takes up all your time.

203
00:16:32,453 --> 00:16:34,174
Guillotine.

204
00:16:37,282 --> 00:16:40,097
You're like a mortician...

205
00:16:40,162 --> 00:16:41,723
or a priest...

206
00:16:43,201 --> 00:16:44,891
or a taxidermist.

207
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,520
All of them.

208
00:16:48,224 --> 00:16:50,168
I mean...

209
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,006
you get to see life upon life.

210
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,079
Most of us get only one,
if that.

211
00:16:58,624 --> 00:17:00,248
What are people's lives like?

212
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:02,740
Do they make any sense?

213
00:17:02,815 --> 00:17:05,749
It all seems so massive
and so random.

214
00:17:05,822 --> 00:17:08,756
Have you ever been
to a Rememory?

215
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,927
No. Well...

216
00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:13,720
Once, a few years ago.

217
00:17:13,789 --> 00:17:15,033
Whose?

218
00:17:16,763 --> 00:17:19,316
My ex-boyfriend.

219
00:17:19,388 --> 00:17:22,454
But I couldn't take it.
I didn't stay.

220
00:17:22,524 --> 00:17:23,898
Why not?

221
00:17:25,241 --> 00:17:27,130
Because it just wasn't...

222
00:17:28,761 --> 00:17:30,801
It wasn't him.

223
00:17:32,281 --> 00:17:35,127
And I wanted
to remember him my way.

224
00:17:36,631 --> 00:17:38,671
Sit down.

225
00:17:43,737 --> 00:17:45,230
Thank you.

226
00:18:38,286 --> 00:18:41,253
It's like
you read my mind, Alan.

227
00:18:41,326 --> 00:18:44,871
I have this recurring dream
where I'm aging backwards.

228
00:19:19,527 --> 00:19:21,119
Wow.

229
00:19:27,046 --> 00:19:29,215
What about all the bits
in between?

230
00:19:29,284 --> 00:19:30,658
It's a miniature.

231
00:19:30,725 --> 00:19:33,278
Concise, symmetrical.

232
00:19:33,349 --> 00:19:35,618
That's the way the world
looks to me...

233
00:19:35,685 --> 00:19:37,027
the way I see it.

234
00:19:38,275 --> 00:19:40,696
How do you do this?

235
00:19:40,771 --> 00:19:43,488
It's what I was meant to do.

236
00:19:43,554 --> 00:19:47,449
You were meant
to live your own life, too.

237
00:19:53,504 --> 00:19:55,392
- Hey.
- Hey.

238
00:20:09,726 --> 00:20:11,548
The house was big...

239
00:20:11,613 --> 00:20:14,001
enormous...

240
00:20:14,078 --> 00:20:15,802
like this one.

241
00:20:15,869 --> 00:20:18,291
We didn't care
whose house it was.

242
00:20:18,397 --> 00:20:22,423
It felt dangerous to be there.

243
00:20:22,524 --> 00:20:25,720
It felt exciting.

244
00:20:25,787 --> 00:20:28,089
I can see the grass.

245
00:20:28,157 --> 00:20:31,635
I can hear it
crunching beneath our feet.

246
00:20:31,706 --> 00:20:33,594
And then the sprinklers
came on...

247
00:20:33,659 --> 00:20:35,927
all around us...

248
00:20:35,994 --> 00:20:38,033
and we ran.

249
00:20:39,577 --> 00:20:42,359
I remember that
like it was yesterday.

250
00:20:46,073 --> 00:20:49,367
Do you recall any moments
with your daughter?

251
00:20:51,479 --> 00:20:53,901
This isn't long ago.

252
00:20:54,008 --> 00:20:56,821
We were watching Isabel
in a school talent show.

253
00:20:56,887 --> 00:21:00,017
She was wonderful that night.

254
00:21:00,085 --> 00:21:03,347
I think Charles and I
both felt...

255
00:21:03,414 --> 00:21:06,194
what an amazing thing
a family was.

256
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,236
We felt it together.

257
00:21:09,717 --> 00:21:12,399
She was up there on that stage.

258
00:21:14,484 --> 00:21:17,517
Oh, goodness.

259
00:21:19,155 --> 00:21:20,714
Excuse me.

260
00:21:20,786 --> 00:21:23,404
I know this is very hard,
Mrs. Bannister...

261
00:21:23,505 --> 00:21:25,164
but it's important.

262
00:21:25,266 --> 00:21:27,722
It's the foundation
of a cutter's work.

263
00:21:27,826 --> 00:21:29,679
I need you and your family...

264
00:21:29,745 --> 00:21:32,462
to help me choose
those moments you want to keep.

265
00:21:33,744 --> 00:21:35,598
I won't be able to do
your husband justice...

266
00:21:35,663 --> 00:21:38,511
if I don't understand him
through you.

267
00:21:40,816 --> 00:21:43,433
I heard you were the best...

268
00:21:43,503 --> 00:21:46,918
that you would know
how to handle Charles.

269
00:21:48,622 --> 00:21:52,777
My husband was a great man,
Mr. Hakman.

270
00:21:52,845 --> 00:21:56,009
He deserves to be remembered
as a great man.

271
00:21:56,108 --> 00:21:57,221
After my initial cut...

272
00:21:57,325 --> 00:21:59,147
I will need
to speak with Isabel.

273
00:22:02,252 --> 00:22:03,908
Is that necessary?

274
00:22:10,507 --> 00:22:12,579
There's nothing that
any one of you can tell me...

275
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:14,438
that I won't know very soon.

276
00:22:14,504 --> 00:22:18,434
Of course. Yes.

277
00:22:18,505 --> 00:22:20,392
Rom.

278
00:22:23,145 --> 00:22:25,119
Please call EYE Tech storage.

279
00:22:25,191 --> 00:22:27,362
Tell them Mr. Hakman
will be dropping by.

280
00:22:27,463 --> 00:22:28,958
Very good, ma'am.

281
00:22:31,655 --> 00:22:33,377
Thank you.

282
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:36,447
I've...

283
00:22:36,517 --> 00:22:39,779
I've seen Rememories
where the cutters were careless.

284
00:22:39,845 --> 00:22:41,699
They had no respect
for the dead.

285
00:22:41,765 --> 00:22:43,739
The dead mean nothing to me,
Mrs. Bannister.

286
00:22:43,812 --> 00:22:47,075
I took this project
because I respect the living.

287
00:22:47,141 --> 00:22:51,396
Remember for yourself!

288
00:22:57,762 --> 00:23:01,438
Live for today!

289
00:23:24,893 --> 00:23:27,891
You are blasphemous, you freak!

290
00:23:27,964 --> 00:23:30,583
Why don't you people go home?

291
00:23:30,685 --> 00:23:33,947
Just go home! Show some respect!

292
00:23:34,013 --> 00:23:35,385
Open your eyes!

293
00:23:38,429 --> 00:23:42,322
I'm sorry, Mrs. Monroe.
It's never been this bad before.

294
00:23:46,361 --> 00:23:49,231
So... this is him, huh?

295
00:23:49,305 --> 00:23:51,955
That's him.

296
00:24:05,943 --> 00:24:08,529
Caroline, are you all right?

297
00:24:20,245 --> 00:24:22,700
You did very well.

298
00:24:22,773 --> 00:24:26,896
Oh, hi. Oh, it's OK.

299
00:24:29,171 --> 00:24:32,945
He's got his eyes open.
He's looking at you.

300
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:35,018
- What's his name?
- Danny.

301
00:24:35,121 --> 00:24:38,055
- Hi, Danny.
- Oh, careful.

302
00:24:38,161 --> 00:24:41,674
Hey, Daniel,
we got some visitors for you.

303
00:24:41,745 --> 00:24:45,454
Look. Everybody's here. Look.

304
00:24:45,521 --> 00:24:48,487
- There's your grandma.
- Look. That's Grandma.

305
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,250
How are you feeling, Eliza?

306
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,654
I'm good. I'm really good.

307
00:24:52,719 --> 00:24:55,369
- Excellent.
- Look what I made.

308
00:24:57,293 --> 00:24:59,628
That looks really good, Danny.

309
00:24:59,694 --> 00:25:01,253
Now go wash out your brush.

310
00:25:01,327 --> 00:25:03,016
Hi!

311
00:25:04,972 --> 00:25:07,142
Come on, Uncle.
Bring a steak for us.

312
00:25:07,244 --> 00:25:08,705
Sit in the shade, honey.

313
00:25:08,813 --> 00:25:10,634
So, Danny, you still drawing?

314
00:25:10,699 --> 00:25:11,845
Nope.

315
00:25:11,947 --> 00:25:14,698
No? Didn't you want to grow up
to be an artist?

316
00:25:14,764 --> 00:25:16,138
Not anymore.

317
00:25:16,202 --> 00:25:17,893
No?
What did you want to be, then?

318
00:25:17,962 --> 00:25:19,042
A doctor.

319
00:25:19,114 --> 00:25:21,569
A doctor, eh? Clever kid.

320
00:25:21,642 --> 00:25:23,167
That'll keep you in the bucks.

321
00:25:23,241 --> 00:25:24,617
Why a doctor?

322
00:25:24,681 --> 00:25:26,689
Because I want to help people
when they're hurt.

323
00:25:26,762 --> 00:25:28,450
Would you listen to
this little kid?

324
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,375
You got a good heart, Danny.

325
00:25:30,441 --> 00:25:32,263
And that's all you need in life.

326
00:25:32,329 --> 00:25:34,848
Come on. Be a good boy
and eat your lunch.

327
00:25:46,183 --> 00:25:49,029
Now I make the incision here.

328
00:25:49,094 --> 00:25:50,948
Hand me the number 17, please.

329
00:25:51,013 --> 00:25:52,954
Actually, Professor,
I think the number 12...

330
00:25:53,028 --> 00:25:54,817
would be more appropriate.

331
00:25:54,884 --> 00:25:58,017
Yes. Correct. The number 12.

332
00:25:58,085 --> 00:26:00,604
Thank you, Mr. Monroe.

333
00:26:05,186 --> 00:26:07,259
Hello there.
I'm Dr. Daniel Monroe.

334
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:10,264
I've seen you around
the hospital these last few days

335
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:14,080
and I couldn't help but notice
the most beautiful woman here.

336
00:26:15,713 --> 00:26:18,844
I was wondering if maybe
you'd like to join me...

337
00:26:18,913 --> 00:26:20,735
for dinner sometime.

338
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,450
That might be nice.

339
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,007
You lasted longer
than I thought you would.

340
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:27,509
Come on, Danny boy.

341
00:26:38,494 --> 00:26:41,558
It's a strange profession
you have, isn't it, Alan?

342
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:45,304
You take people's lives,
make lies out of them.

343
00:26:45,372 --> 00:26:47,673
Fletcher.
It's been a long time.

344
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,399
Eight years.

345
00:26:49,468 --> 00:26:53,329
Yeah. I don't have time
to catch up right now.

346
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:55,443
Come on! Speech!

347
00:26:55,515 --> 00:26:56,888
- Say something.
- Speech.

348
00:26:56,954 --> 00:27:00,401
I want to thank all of you.
I mean that.

349
00:27:00,473 --> 00:27:04,269
This is the best birthday
I have ever had.

350
00:27:04,344 --> 00:27:07,378
How can you handle it, Alan?

351
00:27:07,449 --> 00:27:09,303
People sleeping and shitting...

352
00:27:09,368 --> 00:27:11,701
people stealing
from each other...

353
00:27:11,767 --> 00:27:13,175
manipulating each other...

354
00:27:13,239 --> 00:27:14,548
the obscenity.

355
00:27:15,574 --> 00:27:17,909
I can't talk. I'm working.

356
00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:25,930
Well, now... I'm hurt.

357
00:27:26,006 --> 00:27:27,184
That's not why I'm here.

358
00:27:27,254 --> 00:27:28,912
I'm booked solid
for the next two months.

359
00:27:28,982 --> 00:27:32,427
No, no, no.
I don't have a job lead for you.

360
00:27:32,499 --> 00:27:34,835
You do have something
that I need, though.

361
00:27:34,901 --> 00:27:36,395
What could I possibly have
that you want?

362
00:27:36,468 --> 00:27:38,377
I know you've taken
the Bannister project...

363
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:40,306
and I want it.

364
00:27:42,098 --> 00:27:44,334
Wow. I thought
you'd given up cutting.

365
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:49,804
I'm offering you
$500,000 in cash.

366
00:27:52,529 --> 00:27:54,416
Oh, what? The code?

367
00:27:54,479 --> 00:27:56,969
Would you forget
the damn code and grow up?

368
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,731
This is real life now.

369
00:28:17,804 --> 00:28:19,976
Hey, did you change
the color of our fishing boat?

370
00:28:20,077 --> 00:28:22,083
- I would never do that.
- Are you sure?

371
00:28:22,188 --> 00:28:25,416
Because I remember
it being green, not red.

372
00:28:25,484 --> 00:28:28,166
Weird. All my memories
in that boat...

373
00:28:28,235 --> 00:28:32,641
have it being green.
It just blew my mind.

374
00:28:32,712 --> 00:28:34,568
Maybe it was green.

375
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:38,177
Will you excuse me?
I have to go.

376
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,323
OK. Rush, rush, rush.

377
00:28:40,393 --> 00:28:42,629
Beautiful work, Mr. Hakman.

378
00:28:42,697 --> 00:28:44,452
I'll keep you in mind for me.

379
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,479
Ah, yes, the questions.
"I remember it differently.

380
00:28:52,582 --> 00:28:53,891
"Are you sure
that's what happened?"

381
00:28:53,957 --> 00:28:55,583
Some of us still
live by the code, Fletcher.

382
00:28:55,654 --> 00:28:57,956
We didn't walk away.
We have what it takes.

383
00:28:58,021 --> 00:28:59,232
And what does it take, Alan?

384
00:28:59,303 --> 00:29:01,822
Delusion? Obsession? Guilt?

385
00:29:01,894 --> 00:29:04,577
No, I don't have any of those...

386
00:29:04,644 --> 00:29:06,335
not as much as you do.

387
00:29:06,404 --> 00:29:08,161
I'll be in touch.

388
00:29:18,017 --> 00:29:19,841
Wait!

389
00:29:23,904 --> 00:29:26,043
He was such a good father, too.

390
00:29:26,145 --> 00:29:28,120
When his son had the mumps?
Oh, my God!

391
00:29:28,225 --> 00:29:30,395
My heart was in my throat.

392
00:29:30,464 --> 00:29:33,945
That part with the partners.
Could you believe that?

393
00:29:34,016 --> 00:29:36,154
It's the Rememory
your husband deserved, Caroline.

394
00:29:36,223 --> 00:29:38,612
He really was someone special.

395
00:29:38,687 --> 00:29:40,344
Thank you, Nathalie.

396
00:29:40,415 --> 00:29:43,229
Yeah! Danny! Danny!

397
00:29:48,157 --> 00:29:50,645
Excuse me.

398
00:29:50,718 --> 00:29:52,123
Mr. Hakman.

399
00:29:52,189 --> 00:29:53,847
Mrs. Monroe.

400
00:29:53,949 --> 00:29:56,915
Why are they tattooed like that?

401
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,677
I'm not sure.

402
00:29:58,781 --> 00:30:00,568
They're so grotesque,
aren't they?

403
00:30:02,266 --> 00:30:04,154
Sorry about your loss.

404
00:30:08,506 --> 00:30:10,032
Thank you.

405
00:30:10,105 --> 00:30:11,535
Look! It's the cutter!

406
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,528
Open your eyes!

407
00:30:20,504 --> 00:30:22,675
Hey! Back off! Back off!

408
00:30:22,744 --> 00:30:24,631
Keep your distance.

409
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,902
Receiving Zoe footage,
Charles Bannister.

410
00:31:07,889 --> 00:31:13,997
Processing 544,628 life hours.

411
00:31:17,358 --> 00:31:19,212
Sorting life files.

412
00:31:19,277 --> 00:31:21,067
Childhood...

413
00:31:21,134 --> 00:31:22,376
sleep...

414
00:31:22,445 --> 00:31:24,136
puberty...

415
00:31:24,206 --> 00:31:26,060
eating...

416
00:31:26,125 --> 00:31:27,913
awkward phase...

417
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:30,152
romantic life...

418
00:31:30,253 --> 00:31:32,640
temptation...

419
00:31:32,747 --> 00:31:34,569
personal hygiene...

420
00:31:34,635 --> 00:31:36,391
religion...

421
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:38,181
tragedy...

422
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:40,005
wedding...

423
00:31:40,073 --> 00:31:42,016
masturbation...

424
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:43,813
fears...

425
00:31:43,882 --> 00:31:45,954
athletics...

426
00:31:46,026 --> 00:31:47,749
growth spurt...

427
00:31:47,816 --> 00:31:49,726
university...

428
00:31:49,801 --> 00:31:51,874
violence...

429
00:31:51,945 --> 00:31:53,089
school...

430
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:54,621
courtship...

431
00:31:54,696 --> 00:31:56,190
career...

432
00:32:29,921 --> 00:32:31,297
...these documents...

433
00:32:31,361 --> 00:32:34,678
and I'm quite concerned
about EYE Tech's liability.

434
00:32:34,753 --> 00:32:36,729
I think if any of this
were to get out...

435
00:32:36,834 --> 00:32:38,524
it could be quite devastating.

436
00:32:38,594 --> 00:32:44,255
We do have $1.2 billion
that we wish to invest...

437
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:48,150
and I'm just wondering,
with EYE Tech, if there's...

438
00:32:50,815 --> 00:32:52,723
What do you think?

439
00:32:54,047 --> 00:32:56,697
I love it. Thank you, Charles.

440
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:59,253
Hey, Joey, come help me
build a sandcastle.

441
00:32:59,326 --> 00:33:00,700
Here. Use my shovel.

442
00:33:00,765 --> 00:33:02,936
Happy anniversary, honey.

443
00:33:03,005 --> 00:33:04,893
Is it keys?

444
00:34:10,708 --> 00:34:13,324
Hi, baby. You still awake?

445
00:34:13,425 --> 00:34:14,832
No.

446
00:34:19,825 --> 00:34:21,833
Daddy loves you so much.

447
00:34:21,905 --> 00:34:23,627
You know that.

448
00:34:24,689 --> 00:34:27,208
I love you, too, Dad.

449
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,668
Do you want to come down
to my study?

450
00:34:29,742 --> 00:34:32,492
I'd like to show you
what I'm working on.

451
00:34:32,557 --> 00:34:34,413
What are you working on?

452
00:34:34,478 --> 00:34:37,445
It's a new case. Come on.

453
00:34:37,518 --> 00:34:38,892
OK.

454
00:34:50,507 --> 00:34:52,515
So, how was school today?

455
00:34:52,588 --> 00:34:56,645
Good. We read a book
about Kipper, the Sparky Dog.

456
00:34:56,715 --> 00:34:58,602
Kipper, the Sparky Dog?

457
00:34:58,666 --> 00:35:02,625
He's a very happy dog.

458
00:35:02,697 --> 00:35:03,874
Daddy?

459
00:35:03,946 --> 00:35:05,319
What, sweetie?

460
00:35:05,385 --> 00:35:06,758
Can I have a pet?

461
00:35:06,825 --> 00:35:09,639
Well, maybe. What kind of pet?

462
00:35:09,705 --> 00:35:11,231
Maybe a kitty.

463
00:35:11,305 --> 00:35:13,160
A kitty? Of course.

464
00:35:13,225 --> 00:35:15,132
Go on in, honey.

465
00:35:40,227 --> 00:35:42,780
- Daddy?
- Yes, sweetie?

466
00:35:42,851 --> 00:35:45,119
I want to go back to bed.

467
00:35:45,217 --> 00:35:47,258
In a little while, baby.

468
00:35:47,362 --> 00:35:48,823
In a little while.

469
00:36:03,455 --> 00:36:08,190
Daddy loves you so much.
You know that.

470
00:36:08,255 --> 00:36:10,293
And I love you, too, Dad.

471
00:36:14,014 --> 00:36:15,441
Thank you.

472
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:18,812
Wasn't she wonderful?

473
00:36:26,171 --> 00:36:27,697
- You look lovely, honey.
- Thank you.

474
00:36:27,771 --> 00:36:30,769
I'll tell Rom to bring up
some more champagne.

475
00:36:30,842 --> 00:36:33,909
- Fine.
- Would you like one, sir?

476
00:36:33,979 --> 00:36:35,387
No, thank you.

477
00:36:46,295 --> 00:36:48,150
Isabel wanted to stay up
and say hello...

478
00:36:48,216 --> 00:36:50,159
but the poor thing fell asleep.

479
00:36:50,263 --> 00:36:51,669
It's a beautiful picture.

480
00:36:51,734 --> 00:36:53,644
She's a very bright little girl.

481
00:36:53,751 --> 00:36:55,823
Yes, she is.
Jennifer and I are very lucky.

482
00:36:55,928 --> 00:36:57,332
We're very fortunate.

483
00:36:57,398 --> 00:36:59,886
We're looking forward
to spending...

484
00:37:17,427 --> 00:37:19,019
So, what's your name?

485
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:20,651
Louis. Yours?

486
00:37:20,721 --> 00:37:22,129
Alan.

487
00:37:45,806 --> 00:37:47,301
Identity match.

488
00:37:54,798 --> 00:37:56,204
Searching.

489
00:38:11,114 --> 00:38:12,488
Come on.

490
00:38:12,554 --> 00:38:14,244
No, I can't move.

491
00:38:14,312 --> 00:38:16,038
I can't move!

492
00:38:21,031 --> 00:38:22,754
I know you've taken
the Bannister project...

493
00:38:22,823 --> 00:38:24,995
and I want it.

494
00:38:27,272 --> 00:38:29,605
I found something, Delila.

495
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:31,557
I mean, in a new project.

496
00:38:31,622 --> 00:38:34,938
Something very important,
and I have to explore it.

497
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:36,673
It's...

498
00:38:36,742 --> 00:38:38,912
A new cutting project?

499
00:38:38,982 --> 00:38:41,435
That's what you're talking
to me about, Alan?

500
00:38:41,507 --> 00:38:42,916
Well, more than that.

501
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:45,151
Alan,
you've seen so much life...

502
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:47,358
and somehow you miss the point.

503
00:38:47,427 --> 00:38:49,466
I mean, I haven't
even heard from you...

504
00:38:49,539 --> 00:38:51,546
since that night
at your apartment.

505
00:38:51,619 --> 00:38:53,179
I need you.

506
00:38:55,938 --> 00:38:58,272
Why?

507
00:39:00,577 --> 00:39:02,945
Why do you need me?

508
00:39:05,856 --> 00:39:07,863
There's no place for me
with you.

509
00:39:07,935 --> 00:39:09,943
You haven't even made room
for yourself.

510
00:39:10,016 --> 00:39:14,456
You have to separate yourself
from that machine.

511
00:39:14,527 --> 00:39:17,342
Yeah. Yeah.

512
00:39:17,407 --> 00:39:19,773
Alan?

513
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:48,722
Alan.

514
00:39:48,793 --> 00:39:49,938
You look like shit.

515
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:51,438
What happened to your face?

516
00:39:51,513 --> 00:39:56,083
This? Rather not elaborate.
Come in.

517
00:39:56,152 --> 00:40:00,244
I mean, you decided
that this scene, this event...

518
00:40:00,312 --> 00:40:02,252
is what made this woman
who she was.

519
00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:04,214
You've taken
this woman's entire life...

520
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,134
and drawn a straight line
from this particular moment.

521
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,053
How can you make
a decision like that?

522
00:40:08,119 --> 00:40:09,612
Whittling a life down to one...

523
00:40:09,718 --> 00:40:13,012
Michael, we have to make
story decisions.

524
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:14,932
Otherwise,
there will be no Rememories.

525
00:40:14,997 --> 00:40:17,068
Yeah, I still don't buy it.

526
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:19,028
You don't have to buy it.

527
00:40:19,093 --> 00:40:22,571
You just have to do it.
Trust me.

528
00:40:24,211 --> 00:40:26,067
Alan, darling, you look spooked.

529
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:28,303
Sorry about the place.
The kid's mess.

530
00:40:28,372 --> 00:40:29,897
I need to speak with you alone.

531
00:40:33,201 --> 00:40:35,535
Michael, honey, would you
run down to the store...

532
00:40:35,602 --> 00:40:37,456
and buy us some cigarettes?

533
00:40:37,521 --> 00:40:38,982
We've got eight packs already.

534
00:40:39,088 --> 00:40:40,716
Then go and return them,
sweetheart.

535
00:40:40,786 --> 00:40:42,214
We don't need so many.

536
00:40:49,615 --> 00:40:51,851
He's an emotional one.

537
00:40:51,919 --> 00:40:54,734
Now... are you all right?

538
00:40:54,798 --> 00:40:57,286
I saw Fletcher yesterday.

539
00:40:57,357 --> 00:40:58,787
Really?

540
00:40:58,861 --> 00:41:00,171
Yeah.

541
00:41:00,238 --> 00:41:01,962
Fletcher.

542
00:41:03,437 --> 00:41:06,753
Now, he was a great assistant.

543
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:08,683
What happened to him
after he quit?

544
00:41:08,748 --> 00:41:10,603
He seems changed.

545
00:41:10,668 --> 00:41:13,482
We kept in touch
for a few years...

546
00:41:13,547 --> 00:41:16,362
and then his sister Laura...
You remember Laura.

547
00:41:16,426 --> 00:41:19,177
She had a son,
died of leukemia.

548
00:41:19,243 --> 00:41:23,018
He was only twelve.
She never got over it.

549
00:41:23,082 --> 00:41:27,520
She spent days and days watching
his unedited Zoe footage...

550
00:41:27,591 --> 00:41:30,406
stopped speaking to everyone.

551
00:41:30,471 --> 00:41:33,855
And then she didn't even
recognize who Fletcher was.

552
00:41:33,928 --> 00:41:36,960
After that, he dropped off
the map completely.

553
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:39,421
Think he could be involved
with anti-implant groups?

554
00:41:39,496 --> 00:41:41,284
I've heard rumors...

555
00:41:41,351 --> 00:41:44,284
talk of them being organized
by an ex-cutter.

556
00:41:44,389 --> 00:41:46,658
I never thought
it could be Fletcher.

557
00:41:46,727 --> 00:41:50,469
He wants to buy
Bannister's footage.

558
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:55,546
These anti-implant groups have
become like religious fanatics.

559
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:59,514
They gave Michael one hell
of a beating last night.

560
00:41:59,587 --> 00:42:03,263
So it's not just talk anymore.

561
00:42:03,331 --> 00:42:06,013
You know,
if they want Bannister's life...

562
00:42:06,082 --> 00:42:07,969
the bastard's
not worth fighting for.

563
00:42:08,035 --> 00:42:09,179
Give the footage
back to his widow.

564
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:10,363
Let her deal with it.

565
00:42:10,465 --> 00:42:11,873
I can't give it back.

566
00:42:11,938 --> 00:42:13,596
There's someone in that project
I haven't seen for years.

567
00:42:13,665 --> 00:42:15,038
I hate when that happens.

568
00:42:15,104 --> 00:42:16,927
Oh, yeah.

569
00:42:16,994 --> 00:42:18,683
He's at a party, in a crowd...

570
00:42:18,752 --> 00:42:20,608
never mentioned by name.

571
00:42:20,674 --> 00:42:22,526
I've got to find him, though.

572
00:42:22,592 --> 00:42:24,926
He's not a main character
in Bannister's life.

573
00:42:24,992 --> 00:42:26,365
It'll take
the Guillotine days...

574
00:42:26,432 --> 00:42:28,187
to track his face
through the footage.

575
00:42:28,255 --> 00:42:29,849
Who is this person?

576
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:34,361
Just someone from my childhood.

577
00:42:34,429 --> 00:42:36,795
Bannister's life
is my only lead.

578
00:42:40,187 --> 00:42:44,018
OK. Go through the family,
snoop around...

579
00:42:44,125 --> 00:42:47,123
tell them you're doing research
for the project.

580
00:42:47,227 --> 00:42:50,543
It might be faster
than waiting for the Guillotine.

581
00:42:52,058 --> 00:42:54,360
Be careful, Alan.

582
00:43:08,503 --> 00:43:10,478
So...

583
00:43:10,551 --> 00:43:12,439
how is it that you and I
know each other again?

584
00:43:12,502 --> 00:43:14,063
We don't.

585
00:43:14,168 --> 00:43:16,589
That's the wrong answer, pal.

586
00:43:16,694 --> 00:43:19,246
We share a mutual friend.
Billy Finch.

587
00:43:19,350 --> 00:43:21,356
Billy who?

588
00:43:21,462 --> 00:43:23,152
Don't play games.
I know you better than that.

589
00:43:23,222 --> 00:43:25,229
I know all
your little secrets, Oliver.

590
00:43:25,301 --> 00:43:26,511
How do you know my name?

591
00:43:26,581 --> 00:43:29,744
I know that you suffocated
those kittens when you were 13.

592
00:43:29,812 --> 00:43:32,429
I know that that scar on
your head was self-inflicted...

593
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:33,873
and I know
that you sold Billy the gun...

594
00:43:33,939 --> 00:43:35,947
that he killed his brother with.

595
00:43:36,019 --> 00:43:37,873
They say that friends
help you move...

596
00:43:37,938 --> 00:43:40,590
but good friends help you
move bodies, don't they?

597
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:42,992
I just want what Billy wanted.

598
00:43:43,058 --> 00:43:44,553
A gun.

599
00:43:50,449 --> 00:43:51,976
Take it. Take it.

600
00:43:55,728 --> 00:43:57,736
And these. Take these.

601
00:43:57,807 --> 00:43:59,912
Take them all.

602
00:43:59,983 --> 00:44:02,733
Please go, OK? Just go.

603
00:44:02,798 --> 00:44:05,286
Thank you, OIlie.

604
00:44:06,607 --> 00:44:08,132
Take care.

605
00:44:25,004 --> 00:44:26,661
I'm here.

606
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:28,867
Is this why you wanted
to meet me here?

607
00:44:28,937 --> 00:44:30,532
I thought
it would be safer this way.

608
00:44:32,297 --> 00:44:33,542
How's Thelma doing?

609
00:44:33,609 --> 00:44:37,383
I can't give you Bannister,
and you know I can't.

610
00:44:37,449 --> 00:44:39,968
It's unbelievable,
when you think about it.

611
00:44:41,447 --> 00:44:44,001
One in twenty of these people
has an implant.

612
00:44:44,072 --> 00:44:47,454
How will that baby remember
his mother years from now?

613
00:44:47,528 --> 00:44:50,014
Will he remember the special
moments between them...

614
00:44:50,118 --> 00:44:54,013
or moments someone like you
decides are special?

615
00:44:54,119 --> 00:44:55,525
My job is
to help people remember...

616
00:44:55,590 --> 00:44:57,531
what they want to remember,
Fletcher.

617
00:44:57,638 --> 00:45:00,451
Ah. Oh, that's noble.

618
00:45:00,516 --> 00:45:03,418
But I don't think you understand
the scope of the damage.

619
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:04,802
There is no way to measure...

620
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:07,008
the profound effect
the Zoe implant has had...

621
00:45:07,076 --> 00:45:09,018
on the way
people relate to each other.

622
00:45:09,092 --> 00:45:11,906
"Am I being filmed?
Should I say this or not?

623
00:45:11,971 --> 00:45:15,069
"What'll they think in 30 years
if I do this or that?"

624
00:45:15,138 --> 00:45:17,855
What about the simple right
not to be photographed?

625
00:45:17,923 --> 00:45:19,745
The right not to pop up
in some guy's Rememory...

626
00:45:19,811 --> 00:45:21,665
without even knowing
you were being filmed?

627
00:45:21,761 --> 00:45:23,255
I didn't invent the technology.

628
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:25,695
If people didn't want it,
they wouldn't buy it, Fletcher.

629
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,321
It fulfills a human need.

630
00:45:27,425 --> 00:45:30,272
Alan, you take murderers
and make them saints.

631
00:45:30,336 --> 00:45:32,604
That's why we need
Charles Bannister.

632
00:45:32,672 --> 00:45:34,013
He was a public figure
for EYE Tech...

633
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,453
their star attorney...

634
00:45:35,519 --> 00:45:36,894
well respected,
loved his family...

635
00:45:36,959 --> 00:45:38,998
gave to charity, and if
you get through with him...

636
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:41,207
that's all
anyone will ever know.

637
00:45:41,277 --> 00:45:43,699
But Bannister is
the first EYE Tech employee...

638
00:45:43,772 --> 00:45:46,009
whose implant has left
the confines of the corporation.

639
00:45:46,077 --> 00:45:47,571
His widow fought for that.

640
00:45:47,646 --> 00:45:50,679
We know she's hiding something
about him and his daughter...

641
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:52,178
and we're gonna find it.

642
00:45:52,252 --> 00:45:53,812
EYE Tech's hands aren't clean.

643
00:45:53,916 --> 00:45:55,509
Bannister's implant is evidence.

644
00:45:55,612 --> 00:45:57,205
So you want to destroy
EYE Tech with a scandal?

645
00:45:57,308 --> 00:46:00,089
Absolutely.
The press would go apeshit.

646
00:46:00,155 --> 00:46:01,398
He's the perfect candidate.

647
00:46:01,466 --> 00:46:03,288
I must have his footage.

648
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:08,566
Is this about your sister?

649
00:46:10,523 --> 00:46:12,376
Don't even say her name.

650
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:14,807
You don't know anything
about that.

651
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:19,447
She has nothing to do with it.

652
00:46:19,513 --> 00:46:22,130
These implants
distort personal history...

653
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,054
and therefore all history...

654
00:46:24,119 --> 00:46:26,769
and I will not stand by
while the past is rewritten...

655
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:28,529
for the sake
of pleasant Rememories.

656
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:29,906
Tell me something.

657
00:46:29,974 --> 00:46:31,830
Why is your name
the first on the list...

658
00:46:31,894 --> 00:46:33,322
for cutting
scumbags and lowlifes?

659
00:46:33,428 --> 00:46:35,315
Because I forgive people
long after...

660
00:46:35,413 --> 00:46:37,038
they could be punished
for their sins.

661
00:46:37,109 --> 00:46:39,629
I know what you do.

662
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:42,002
Why do you do it?

663
00:46:42,069 --> 00:46:44,587
Do you know
what a sin eater is?

664
00:46:47,667 --> 00:46:51,050
It's part of
an ancient tradition.

665
00:46:51,123 --> 00:46:54,470
When someone would die,
they would call for a sin eater.

666
00:46:54,546 --> 00:46:58,157
Sin eaters were
social outcasts, marginals.

667
00:46:58,259 --> 00:46:59,434
They would lay out the body...

668
00:46:59,536 --> 00:47:01,609
put bread and salt
on the chest...

669
00:47:01,713 --> 00:47:03,403
coins upon the eyes.

670
00:47:03,472 --> 00:47:05,642
The sin eater would eat
the bread and salt...

671
00:47:05,711 --> 00:47:07,566
take the coins as payment.

672
00:47:07,631 --> 00:47:10,445
By doing this,
the eater absorbed...

673
00:47:10,511 --> 00:47:13,194
the sins of the deceased,
cleansing their soul...

674
00:47:13,263 --> 00:47:16,393
and allowing them safe passage
into the afterlife.

675
00:47:16,463 --> 00:47:18,088
That was their job.

676
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:23,875
And what about the sin eater...

677
00:47:23,948 --> 00:47:26,916
who bears the burden
of all those wrongs?

678
00:47:26,988 --> 00:47:29,670
Are you worried
about my soul, Fletcher?

679
00:47:33,259 --> 00:47:34,820
I will have Bannister.

680
00:47:34,923 --> 00:47:37,311
I can't give him to you.

681
00:47:39,658 --> 00:47:42,341
You see that man behind me?

682
00:47:42,410 --> 00:47:45,955
I don't want to bring him
into this conversation...

683
00:47:46,024 --> 00:47:50,018
but I will if you leave me
no other choice.

684
00:47:50,088 --> 00:47:51,517
Alan!

685
00:47:52,618 --> 00:47:53,859
Alan!

686
00:48:17,189 --> 00:48:18,365
Do you remember the moment...

687
00:48:18,436 --> 00:48:20,290
you first fell in love
with your husband?

688
00:48:22,628 --> 00:48:26,751
Goodness. How can you answer
a question like that?

689
00:48:26,818 --> 00:48:27,745
The pier?

690
00:48:27,811 --> 00:48:29,272
Yes, the pier.

691
00:48:29,347 --> 00:48:31,735
He had taken me down
to the pier.

692
00:48:31,810 --> 00:48:33,402
It was springtime.

693
00:48:33,505 --> 00:48:35,329
We were walking,
and he was going on...

694
00:48:35,394 --> 00:48:36,766
This was during college?

695
00:48:36,832 --> 00:48:38,327
Yes, I was in college...

696
00:48:38,432 --> 00:48:40,255
and I remember,
I looked up at him...

697
00:48:40,321 --> 00:48:41,881
and I thought,
this is the man...

698
00:48:41,952 --> 00:48:44,025
I want to spend
the rest of my life with.

699
00:48:45,790 --> 00:48:47,646
I just have one more question.

700
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:49,882
There was a man
at one of your parties.

701
00:48:49,950 --> 00:48:51,957
- A man?
- Yes. A man with glasses.

702
00:48:52,031 --> 00:48:54,169
You may have noticed them.
They're very thick glasses.

703
00:48:54,238 --> 00:48:55,700
Thick glasses?

704
00:48:55,775 --> 00:48:58,904
Mr. Hakman,
how is this relevant?

705
00:48:58,972 --> 00:49:01,874
Minor people I don't even know
have no place in the Rememory.

706
00:49:01,949 --> 00:49:03,738
Family...

707
00:49:03,805 --> 00:49:05,333
career...

708
00:49:05,405 --> 00:49:06,930
community.

709
00:49:07,036 --> 00:49:10,330
That's all I want.
Cut everything else.

710
00:49:11,706 --> 00:49:13,877
Maybe I could speak with Isabel?

711
00:49:15,195 --> 00:49:16,622
Right now?

712
00:49:16,698 --> 00:49:18,192
It would be very helpful.

713
00:49:20,473 --> 00:49:22,644
Yes, of course.

714
00:49:25,722 --> 00:49:26,832
Isabel?

715
00:49:30,072 --> 00:49:33,073
Remember what I told you?

716
00:49:33,145 --> 00:49:35,794
Mr. Hakman wants
to talk to you about Daddy.

717
00:49:35,863 --> 00:49:37,836
It's for Daddy's Rememory.

718
00:49:37,942 --> 00:49:39,023
Mrs. Bannister?

719
00:49:39,127 --> 00:49:41,232
We have a problem
with the caterers.

720
00:49:49,364 --> 00:49:51,022
Hi, Isabel.

721
00:49:51,093 --> 00:49:53,035
Hello, Mr. Hakman.

722
00:49:53,108 --> 00:49:55,247
"Mr. Hakman."
That's very formal.

723
00:49:55,315 --> 00:49:57,997
My name is Alan.

724
00:49:58,067 --> 00:50:01,001
Beautiful house.
What's going on in there?

725
00:50:01,075 --> 00:50:03,409
Birthday party for Mr. Froggy.

726
00:50:03,475 --> 00:50:04,817
Do you think Mr. Froggy
would mind...

727
00:50:04,882 --> 00:50:06,736
if I took you away
from the party for a minute?

728
00:50:06,802 --> 00:50:08,557
OK.

729
00:50:22,542 --> 00:50:24,397
Who's that in your arms?

730
00:50:24,462 --> 00:50:25,990
My doll.

731
00:50:26,063 --> 00:50:28,299
Oh. What's her name?

732
00:50:28,366 --> 00:50:32,140
She doesn't have a name.
She's just a doll. See?

733
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:38,245
Isabel, your daddy...

734
00:50:38,316 --> 00:50:40,290
My daddy is the best daddy
in the world.

735
00:50:40,363 --> 00:50:42,633
He had a really big meeting
one day...

736
00:50:42,732 --> 00:50:44,619
but instead,
he took me horseback riding.

737
00:50:44,684 --> 00:50:47,552
He would read me stories
before bed every night.

738
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:50,277
Sometimes he would make it up
as he went along...

739
00:50:50,347 --> 00:50:52,899
and I knew, but I didn't care.

740
00:50:54,666 --> 00:50:58,112
Your mom said I was here
to talk about your dad.

741
00:50:58,184 --> 00:51:00,519
But we don't have to do that
if you don't want.

742
00:51:00,585 --> 00:51:02,591
I don't want.

743
00:51:02,665 --> 00:51:06,308
OK. Then we won't.

744
00:51:11,078 --> 00:51:13,314
When I was a little older
than you...

745
00:51:13,413 --> 00:51:15,585
I lost both my parents.

746
00:51:17,093 --> 00:51:19,265
Not many people
know what you're feeling.

747
00:51:19,333 --> 00:51:21,789
Not many people understand.

748
00:51:21,893 --> 00:51:23,453
But I do.

749
00:51:25,189 --> 00:51:28,734
You don't want me nosing around,
asking questions.

750
00:51:28,805 --> 00:51:30,692
And you're right.

751
00:51:34,210 --> 00:51:35,454
OK.

752
00:51:37,410 --> 00:51:39,036
Alan...

753
00:51:39,107 --> 00:51:42,651
it's not really
Mr. Froggy's birthday.

754
00:51:44,129 --> 00:51:45,852
It's in a week.

755
00:51:49,377 --> 00:51:52,092
Can I ask one question?
And then I'm gone.

756
00:51:53,376 --> 00:51:56,671
There was a man at
one of your parents' parties.

757
00:51:56,736 --> 00:51:58,592
The thing that's special
about this man...

758
00:51:58,655 --> 00:52:01,305
is he wore glasses
that were very, very thick.

759
00:52:01,374 --> 00:52:04,189
They're almost like the bottom
of a glass bottle.

760
00:52:04,254 --> 00:52:07,701
Mr. Hunt.
I took him the invitation.

761
00:52:07,773 --> 00:52:09,300
Mr. Hunt?

762
00:52:09,372 --> 00:52:11,739
Was his name Louis Hunt?

763
00:52:11,805 --> 00:52:13,298
He was my teacher.

764
00:52:13,371 --> 00:52:15,706
Really? What does he teach?

765
00:52:15,772 --> 00:52:18,521
He doesn't teach anymore.

766
00:52:18,619 --> 00:52:22,230
He died in a car accident
a year ago.

767
00:52:22,299 --> 00:52:23,576
It was very sad.

768
00:52:23,642 --> 00:52:25,976
Did you have a Rememory,
like for your father?

769
00:52:26,041 --> 00:52:27,286
I don't know.

770
00:52:27,354 --> 00:52:29,241
We just had a day at school
where we talked about him.

771
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:34,616
Thank you, Isabel.

772
00:52:38,232 --> 00:52:39,344
Alan?

773
00:52:41,881 --> 00:52:44,879
Are you gonna fix
what my daddy can remember?

774
00:52:48,373 --> 00:52:50,478
In a way... yes.

775
00:52:51,766 --> 00:52:54,765
Can you make him forget
that I...

776
00:52:54,869 --> 00:52:57,586
that I drew on
his contract with crayon?

777
00:52:57,653 --> 00:52:59,408
I will.

778
00:52:59,477 --> 00:53:01,451
And that I pulled
Dottie's hair so hard...

779
00:53:01,524 --> 00:53:03,530
that she cried.
Will he forget that?

780
00:53:03,603 --> 00:53:06,473
He'll forget.

781
00:53:06,548 --> 00:53:08,686
But make sure you don't.

782
00:53:20,497 --> 00:53:22,188
Hey, Alan...

783
00:53:23,792 --> 00:53:25,287
would you relax?

784
00:53:25,392 --> 00:53:28,241
There's nobody
following us, all right?

785
00:53:31,088 --> 00:53:32,997
This is a really big favor
I'm doing for you.

786
00:53:33,071 --> 00:53:36,518
You're lucky my cousin Karim
is working late tonight.

787
00:53:36,590 --> 00:53:37,900
Thank you.

788
00:53:39,534 --> 00:53:40,963
So, what's this guy's name?

789
00:53:41,038 --> 00:53:42,314
Louis Hunt.

790
00:53:42,381 --> 00:53:44,168
If he had an implant...

791
00:53:44,238 --> 00:53:47,051
there will be a record
of it in here.

792
00:53:52,684 --> 00:53:55,103
I could lose my job,
letting cutters in here.

793
00:53:55,210 --> 00:53:58,439
Come on, Karim.
Would I get you in trouble?

794
00:54:08,553 --> 00:54:10,789
They can track anyone
accessing data from a computer,

795
00:54:10,857 --> 00:54:14,271
so this is the best I can do.
Please hurry.

796
00:54:16,071 --> 00:54:18,855
Wait.

797
00:54:18,921 --> 00:54:20,196
These are genealogies.

798
00:54:20,264 --> 00:54:22,238
I don't know his family tree.
How do I use this?

799
00:54:22,312 --> 00:54:25,126
Hard copies are
sorted by series numbers...

800
00:54:25,221 --> 00:54:26,565
alphabetically on the boxes...

801
00:54:26,662 --> 00:54:28,517
and then arranged
by implant date.

802
00:54:28,583 --> 00:54:30,436
He's the same age as I am...

803
00:54:30,503 --> 00:54:33,054
so it would be a 1500 series.

804
00:54:49,474 --> 00:54:52,474
2000. Oh, great.

805
00:55:17,726 --> 00:55:19,995
Hunt.

806
00:55:20,062 --> 00:55:21,950
No Hunt.

807
00:56:15,157 --> 00:56:16,302
Alan!

808
00:56:27,731 --> 00:56:29,420
Alan, are you OK?

809
00:56:29,490 --> 00:56:31,017
I'm fine.

810
00:56:32,210 --> 00:56:33,454
OK.

811
00:56:53,327 --> 00:56:55,693
Hello, Mr. And Mrs. Hakman...

812
00:56:55,757 --> 00:56:58,987
and welcome
to the EYE Tech family.

813
00:56:59,054 --> 00:57:01,354
You've made
an important decision.

814
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:05,544
You've purchased a Zoe implant
for your unborn son.

815
00:57:05,644 --> 00:57:08,099
What does that mean?

816
00:57:08,204 --> 00:57:10,536
Immortality.

817
00:57:10,604 --> 00:57:13,058
No longer do our most cherished
moments together...

818
00:57:13,162 --> 00:57:16,293
have to fade
and disappear over time.

819
00:57:16,362 --> 00:57:20,355
Remember, the Zoe implant
is entirely organic...

820
00:57:20,425 --> 00:57:21,887
and since it grows...

821
00:57:21,962 --> 00:57:24,132
with your baby's brain
and nerve centers...

822
00:57:24,201 --> 00:57:27,812
it's virtually undetectable.

823
00:57:27,881 --> 00:57:30,367
When is the right time
to tell your child...

824
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:32,927
about their miraculous gift?

825
00:57:32,999 --> 00:57:35,333
By their 21st birthday...

826
00:57:35,398 --> 00:57:38,596
most carriers are
mature enough to understand...

827
00:57:38,695 --> 00:57:41,924
and from then on,
your son can live his life...

828
00:57:41,989 --> 00:57:44,891
knowing
that always and forever...

829
00:57:44,997 --> 00:57:50,399
his experiences and adventures
will be revisited and relished,

830
00:57:50,468 --> 00:57:53,631
and that's what
great memories are made of.

831
00:57:53,701 --> 00:57:55,839
Congratulations.

832
00:57:55,908 --> 00:57:58,842
Oh, my God. That's me, man.

833
00:57:59,876 --> 00:58:00,955
That's me.

834
00:58:01,027 --> 00:58:02,716
You take people's lives,
make lies out of them.

835
00:58:02,787 --> 00:58:04,510
My daddy is the best daddy
in the world.

836
00:58:04,578 --> 00:58:06,553
It's unbelievable
when you think about it.

837
00:58:06,626 --> 00:58:08,480
One in twenty of these people
has an implant.

838
00:58:08,546 --> 00:58:11,000
When is the right time
to tell your child...

839
00:58:11,105 --> 00:58:12,511
about their miraculous gift?

840
00:58:12,577 --> 00:58:15,393
What are people's lives like?
Do they make any sense?

841
00:58:15,457 --> 00:58:17,146
It all seems so massive
and so random.

842
00:58:17,217 --> 00:58:18,590
This is real life now.

843
00:58:18,657 --> 00:58:20,511
Don't do that. We're not even
allowed to be here.

844
00:58:20,576 --> 00:58:22,745
You take murderers
and make them saints.

845
00:58:22,814 --> 00:58:24,602
Everybody's here!

846
00:58:24,670 --> 00:58:26,425
- Just someone from my childhood.
- Remember for yourself!

847
00:58:26,493 --> 00:58:28,666
What about the sin eater
bears the burden...

848
00:58:28,734 --> 00:58:30,556
Get out of my head!

849
00:58:36,861 --> 00:58:38,387
Oh, no.

850
00:58:53,177 --> 00:58:55,511
Oh, Alan...

851
00:58:55,578 --> 00:58:58,425
your phone call had me
so worried.

852
00:59:00,826 --> 00:59:03,377
I saw the mirror.

853
00:59:03,448 --> 00:59:05,105
What happened to you?

854
00:59:05,176 --> 00:59:07,215
I saw something.

855
00:59:10,104 --> 00:59:11,215
All right.

856
00:59:11,288 --> 00:59:14,897
You cannot let your work
get to you like this.

857
00:59:16,247 --> 00:59:18,101
Please don't leave.

858
00:59:18,166 --> 00:59:20,817
What have you got to eat
in this dump?

859
00:59:22,486 --> 00:59:24,011
Not much.

860
00:59:26,004 --> 00:59:27,432
Try looking in the cupboards.

861
00:59:29,651 --> 00:59:30,896
The cupboard.

862
00:59:36,978 --> 00:59:38,986
I saw that in a project
I was working on.

863
00:59:39,058 --> 00:59:41,579
An herbalist.
It looked interesting.

864
00:59:49,297 --> 00:59:51,184
That's disgusting.

865
00:59:57,166 --> 00:59:58,891
Well...

866
00:59:58,959 --> 01:00:01,098
I guess we order out, then.

867
01:00:01,166 --> 01:00:04,514
I want to show you something.

868
01:00:04,590 --> 01:00:07,373
I've never shown it to anyone.

869
01:00:53,382 --> 01:00:54,725
What is this?

870
01:00:54,790 --> 01:00:56,480
Some implants have a defect.

871
01:00:56,549 --> 01:00:58,850
They can't differentiate
between what the eye sees...

872
01:00:58,916 --> 01:01:00,803
and what the mind sees.

873
01:01:09,507 --> 01:01:11,679
What?

874
01:01:13,475 --> 01:01:15,001
What were these? Dreams?

875
01:01:15,073 --> 01:01:19,513
Yeah, dreams.
Daydreams. Hallucinations.

876
01:01:19,586 --> 01:01:21,439
It's so beautiful.

877
01:01:54,875 --> 01:01:57,395
Where are you off to, Alan?

878
01:02:00,889 --> 01:02:03,160
Let's do this.

879
01:02:03,227 --> 01:02:05,081
Oh, no. Not now.

880
01:02:05,147 --> 01:02:07,698
There's somebody up there.

881
01:02:07,769 --> 01:02:11,151
This has to be clean.
No mess.

882
01:02:11,225 --> 01:02:14,389
Clean, dirty.
It's all the same to me.

883
01:02:35,541 --> 01:02:38,475
I think he's a cutter.
You want to do him?

884
01:02:38,548 --> 01:02:39,823
Yeah, I'll do him.

885
01:02:45,588 --> 01:02:46,830
Hi.

886
01:03:03,664 --> 01:03:05,158
You can follow her.

887
01:03:07,279 --> 01:03:09,135
Now, you know how this works?

888
01:03:09,199 --> 01:03:10,824
No, not at all.

889
01:03:10,895 --> 01:03:13,960
OK. We draw synth tattoos...

890
01:03:14,030 --> 01:03:16,713
with electrosynthetic ink.

891
01:03:16,782 --> 01:03:18,822
And it creates
a magnetic field...

892
01:03:18,894 --> 01:03:21,194
which interferes
with the Zoe implant...

893
01:03:21,261 --> 01:03:24,675
blocking it from recording
audio or video...

894
01:03:24,748 --> 01:03:27,563
from that point on.

895
01:03:27,628 --> 01:03:30,976
Now, first
we do the audio tattoo...

896
01:03:31,084 --> 01:03:33,057
and we wait a week.

897
01:03:33,163 --> 01:03:38,466
If you don't get a migraine
and your system takes it...

898
01:03:38,538 --> 01:03:41,057
then we'll do the video tattoo.

899
01:03:43,017 --> 01:03:45,985
Do I have to cover
my whole face?

900
01:03:46,058 --> 01:03:48,162
No.

901
01:03:48,233 --> 01:03:52,225
Those guys...
they're just young and angry.

902
01:03:52,294 --> 01:03:55,906
You want it discreet.

903
01:03:55,974 --> 01:03:57,982
Very.

904
01:03:58,054 --> 01:03:59,942
Yeah.

905
01:04:04,805 --> 01:04:06,976
Will this hurt?

906
01:04:07,046 --> 01:04:08,801
Oh, yeah.

907
01:05:30,808 --> 01:05:33,141
Fletcher?

908
01:05:33,207 --> 01:05:34,614
I'm armed.

909
01:05:42,869 --> 01:05:44,209
What's the matter, Delila?

910
01:05:44,275 --> 01:05:46,480
You know
that recurring dream I have?

911
01:05:47,956 --> 01:05:49,812
You know
that recurring dream I have?

912
01:05:49,877 --> 01:05:53,172
Where I get younger and younger?
I had it again.

913
01:05:53,236 --> 01:05:54,925
I make you happy?

914
01:05:54,995 --> 01:05:56,904
Yeah.

915
01:05:56,978 --> 01:05:58,866
Well, I make myself miserable.

916
01:05:58,930 --> 01:06:01,166
That's just
because you're silly.

917
01:06:01,234 --> 01:06:02,827
You're silly.

918
01:06:05,234 --> 01:06:08,844
How can you not be happy
right now?

919
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:14,096
I think the first books I read
were really, really sad.

920
01:06:14,193 --> 01:06:16,809
Why do they make
children's books so sad?

921
01:06:16,879 --> 01:06:18,854
They're always terribly tragic.

922
01:06:26,062 --> 01:06:29,443
Not so hard to make
this thing play disks.

923
01:06:29,518 --> 01:06:31,557
Not so hard at all.

924
01:06:31,629 --> 01:06:34,476
- Delila...
- Shut up!

925
01:06:34,540 --> 01:06:37,441
That was my old boyfriend,
you bastard.

926
01:06:37,516 --> 01:06:40,712
Is that why you wanted
to be with me?

927
01:06:40,779 --> 01:06:44,008
Because you saw some proof
that I'm to your liking?

928
01:06:44,107 --> 01:06:45,252
No.

929
01:06:45,354 --> 01:06:47,177
These moments...

930
01:06:47,243 --> 01:06:50,211
they belong to me, Alan.

931
01:06:50,283 --> 01:06:53,315
The good and the bad.

932
01:06:53,385 --> 01:06:56,482
They're mine and his!

933
01:06:56,553 --> 01:06:59,967
Who are you to take them
away from me?

934
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:02,627
No! No! Don't touch me!

935
01:07:05,063 --> 01:07:06,973
A gun.

936
01:07:08,902 --> 01:07:10,146
Who are you?

937
01:07:10,214 --> 01:07:11,261
Please, please, no.

938
01:07:11,335 --> 01:07:12,479
Who are you, Alan?

939
01:07:12,551 --> 01:07:14,460
No! No!

940
01:07:14,567 --> 01:07:15,939
No!

941
01:07:22,085 --> 01:07:24,703
Why did you do that?

942
01:07:25,733 --> 01:07:27,257
Mine!

943
01:07:48,032 --> 01:07:50,040
You're still here.

944
01:08:01,598 --> 01:08:04,084
Alan, this thing is junked.

945
01:08:04,157 --> 01:08:06,166
The implant itself is severed.

946
01:08:07,453 --> 01:08:10,036
God himself could not
retrieve that footage...

947
01:08:10,108 --> 01:08:11,603
and you know that.

948
01:08:11,677 --> 01:08:14,065
Then we have to access
a different life.

949
01:08:14,141 --> 01:08:17,239
OK. Well, where is it?

950
01:08:20,443 --> 01:08:22,100
My implant.

951
01:08:22,170 --> 01:08:23,545
What?

952
01:08:23,610 --> 01:08:25,103
The one in my head.

953
01:08:37,433 --> 01:08:39,254
You want to take a shot, too?

954
01:08:39,318 --> 01:08:41,587
Everybody else has.

955
01:08:41,654 --> 01:08:43,149
I deserved that one.

956
01:08:43,223 --> 01:08:45,164
You deserve a lot more
than that, Hakman.

957
01:08:45,238 --> 01:08:46,798
Why didn't you tell us, Alan?

958
01:08:46,871 --> 01:08:50,131
Because I didn't know until
I found the files at EYE Tech.

959
01:08:50,230 --> 01:08:52,685
I never thought my parents
could afford one.

960
01:08:52,790 --> 01:08:55,277
Turns out,
they took a loan to get it.

961
01:08:55,382 --> 01:08:56,625
How could you not know?

962
01:08:56,693 --> 01:08:58,865
Because they died before
they told me.

963
01:08:58,932 --> 01:09:00,719
They never got around to it.

964
01:09:00,789 --> 01:09:04,332
You know the code, Alan.
It's one of our central tenets.

965
01:09:04,402 --> 01:09:08,201
A cutter
cannot have a Zoe implant.

966
01:09:08,276 --> 01:09:12,049
I need to access that footage.
I need it right now.

967
01:09:12,114 --> 01:09:13,324
Yeah? Well, that's impossible.

968
01:09:13,394 --> 01:09:14,736
Oh, no, it's possible.

969
01:09:14,802 --> 01:09:16,873
It was done before by you.

970
01:09:16,946 --> 01:09:20,589
An attempt to access footage
while a carrier was still alive.

971
01:09:20,656 --> 01:09:23,077
Yeah. I performed that...

972
01:09:23,184 --> 01:09:25,998
and the woman
never recovered, Alan.

973
01:09:26,063 --> 01:09:28,911
And I will not try that again.

974
01:09:28,976 --> 01:09:31,942
Then you know what it's like
to be haunted.

975
01:09:32,014 --> 01:09:33,541
One memory...

976
01:09:33,615 --> 01:09:37,543
one single incident
has made me who I am.

977
01:09:37,615 --> 01:09:41,989
It won't leave me be.
The guilt tears me apart...

978
01:09:42,062 --> 01:09:43,884
but now I got a chance
to find out the truth.

979
01:09:43,948 --> 01:09:45,323
I have to take it.

980
01:09:45,388 --> 01:09:48,388
Alan, you brought
an implant amongst us.

981
01:09:48,460 --> 01:09:50,434
Why should I help you?

982
01:09:51,756 --> 01:09:53,992
If I try it myself, I'll die.

983
01:09:57,739 --> 01:09:59,942
And I will try it myself.

984
01:10:01,481 --> 01:10:05,375
We've been friends
for too long, my dear.

985
01:10:05,450 --> 01:10:08,068
I can't let you
kill yourself, can I?

986
01:10:08,136 --> 01:10:12,511
But you understand,
you can never cut again.

987
01:10:16,231 --> 01:10:17,824
Yeah.

988
01:10:17,896 --> 01:10:20,283
The last time I tried this,
the woman's nervous system...

989
01:10:20,358 --> 01:10:23,904
shut down immediately.
It couldn't handle it.

990
01:10:23,974 --> 01:10:26,908
She was a blank
for the rest of her life.

991
01:10:34,627 --> 01:10:36,003
Now, remember...

992
01:10:36,067 --> 01:10:37,560
I can't copy anything
into a hard drive.

993
01:10:37,634 --> 01:10:39,229
You can only watch.

994
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:41,305
You know exactly which scene
you're going to?

995
01:10:41,379 --> 01:10:42,622
I sure do.

996
01:10:42,689 --> 01:10:44,316
You have five minutes.

997
01:10:44,387 --> 01:10:46,459
Anything longer than that
is just too risky.

998
01:10:53,024 --> 01:10:54,137
OK.

999
01:12:18,898 --> 01:12:20,306
Christie.

1000
01:12:27,250 --> 01:12:28,657
I remember her.

1001
01:12:57,195 --> 01:12:58,407
It's me.

1002
01:13:11,243 --> 01:13:12,223
Alan.

1003
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:16,001
Almost there.

1004
01:13:17,961 --> 01:13:19,423
There we are.

1005
01:13:19,496 --> 01:13:21,764
Come and get me.

1006
01:13:29,190 --> 01:13:31,677
Let's go back down.

1007
01:13:44,868 --> 01:13:46,275
Don't!

1008
01:13:53,442 --> 01:13:56,573
I'll meet you
back on the ground floor.

1009
01:13:56,642 --> 01:14:00,601
Hold on. I'm coming.

1010
01:14:00,672 --> 01:14:03,640
No. Wait. Wait.

1011
01:14:05,602 --> 01:14:08,569
It isn't steady anymore.

1012
01:14:11,712 --> 01:14:14,614
Louis, please, just stop.

1013
01:14:17,694 --> 01:14:18,675
I can't move!

1014
01:14:18,782 --> 01:14:20,637
OK, Louis, you can make it.

1015
01:14:20,703 --> 01:14:22,076
Just a few more steps.

1016
01:14:23,390 --> 01:14:24,634
Grab my hand!

1017
01:14:26,526 --> 01:14:27,986
Wait!

1018
01:15:06,295 --> 01:15:08,335
Alan...

1019
01:15:08,408 --> 01:15:10,380
- We're done! We're done!
- Alan, unplug it.

1020
01:15:10,453 --> 01:15:11,827
I can't.

1021
01:15:47,762 --> 01:15:48,841
Alan!

1022
01:15:48,944 --> 01:15:50,057
Alan!

1023
01:15:51,088 --> 01:15:52,265
Alan?

1024
01:15:59,342 --> 01:16:00,903
I'm all right.

1025
01:16:00,975 --> 01:16:03,624
Do you have any idea
how close you came?

1026
01:16:05,422 --> 01:16:07,910
I saw him.

1027
01:16:07,982 --> 01:16:10,469
I tried to help.

1028
01:16:10,542 --> 01:16:12,810
I told him to turn around.

1029
01:16:12,876 --> 01:16:16,486
He wouldn't listen.

1030
01:16:16,556 --> 01:16:19,904
He fell, but...

1031
01:16:20,012 --> 01:16:22,431
he was breathing.

1032
01:16:23,850 --> 01:16:25,791
It wasn't blood.

1033
01:16:25,899 --> 01:16:27,970
It was paint.

1034
01:16:30,731 --> 01:16:32,769
Now I remember.

1035
01:16:35,529 --> 01:16:37,089
Thank you.

1036
01:17:46,460 --> 01:17:48,981
Looking for this?

1037
01:17:50,556 --> 01:17:52,444
The implant's history.

1038
01:17:52,509 --> 01:17:54,679
You better find yourself
another perfect candidate.

1039
01:17:56,187 --> 01:17:57,780
Do you know
how much planning it took...

1040
01:17:57,882 --> 01:18:01,265
to make Bannister's footage
available? Do you?

1041
01:18:01,371 --> 01:18:02,963
He died of
a coronary complication.

1042
01:18:03,034 --> 01:18:05,553
I was the complication.

1043
01:18:05,624 --> 01:18:07,218
Or didn't
you get to that part yet?

1044
01:18:07,291 --> 01:18:09,264
I guess no one will.

1045
01:18:09,337 --> 01:18:11,704
I bet he still keeps good notes.
Don't you, Alan?

1046
01:18:41,333 --> 01:18:42,640
All of it?

1047
01:18:42,707 --> 01:18:44,649
All of it.

1048
01:18:44,724 --> 01:18:46,348
It was a terrible accident.

1049
01:18:46,418 --> 01:18:51,274
Sometimes the older Guillotines
can damage a Zoe implant.

1050
01:18:51,346 --> 01:18:53,832
There's no replacing
your husband's life.

1051
01:18:53,906 --> 01:18:55,595
He deserved a Rememory...

1052
01:18:55,665 --> 01:18:58,152
and a place
in your Zoe family tree.

1053
01:18:58,257 --> 01:18:59,685
I'm sorry.

1054
01:19:04,944 --> 01:19:07,845
You will... waive your fee?

1055
01:19:07,919 --> 01:19:09,325
Of course.

1056
01:19:09,389 --> 01:19:12,237
And you'll never speak
of Charles to anyone?

1057
01:19:12,302 --> 01:19:16,230
What can one do?
Accidents will happen.

1058
01:19:18,414 --> 01:19:21,479
Perhaps some things
are best forgotten.

1059
01:19:24,685 --> 01:19:26,572
Perhaps.

1060
01:19:41,482 --> 01:19:43,456
God, Isabel, you scared me.

1061
01:19:46,089 --> 01:19:49,503
Isabel, honey,
what's the matter?

1062
01:19:49,576 --> 01:19:52,445
Isabel.

1063
01:19:54,407 --> 01:19:56,262
Isabel, what...

1064
01:19:56,328 --> 01:19:58,181
What's wrong, honey?

1065
01:20:02,598 --> 01:20:03,972
Isabel.

1066
01:21:27,992 --> 01:21:29,552
A friend?

1067
01:21:30,902 --> 01:21:33,204
Yeah. Something like that.

1068
01:21:33,271 --> 01:21:35,507
I hear
you're not cutting anymore.

1069
01:21:36,694 --> 01:21:39,083
I've had enough
of other people's lives.

1070
01:21:40,597 --> 01:21:43,563
Stop, Alan.
I can't let you go.

1071
01:21:43,668 --> 01:21:44,846
What now?

1072
01:21:44,917 --> 01:21:46,772
Word travels fast in my circles.

1073
01:21:46,837 --> 01:21:50,861
Word is, a cutter came in
for a synth tattoo.

1074
01:21:50,931 --> 01:21:54,248
Word is that cutter is you.

1075
01:21:54,322 --> 01:21:57,171
You saw that implant.
It was destroyed. It's useless.

1076
01:21:57,235 --> 01:21:59,122
You.

1077
01:21:59,186 --> 01:22:02,349
Bannister's footage is gone,
but you've seen his life.

1078
01:22:02,417 --> 01:22:05,200
It's encrypted
into your implant.

1079
01:24:38,136 --> 01:24:40,339
Will you look at that?

1080
01:25:15,569 --> 01:25:17,195
Come and get me.

1081
01:25:20,241 --> 01:25:22,215
He had a very big meeting
one day...

1082
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:24,622
but he took me
horseback riding instead.

1083
01:25:24,687 --> 01:25:27,468
He would read me stories
every night.

1084
01:25:27,535 --> 01:25:30,055
Sometimes he would make it up
as he went along...

1085
01:25:30,127 --> 01:25:32,461
and I knew, but I didn't care.

1086
01:25:32,526 --> 01:25:35,494
Your mom said I was here
to talk about your dad.

1087
01:25:35,567 --> 01:25:37,572
We don't need to do that
if you don't want to.

1088
01:25:37,645 --> 01:25:39,914
- Daddy?
- Yes, sweetie?

1089
01:25:39,981 --> 01:25:41,803
- Alan, please!
- I want to go back to bed.

1090
01:25:41,869 --> 01:25:43,624
- It's John's birthday.
- We'll have meatballs.

1091
01:25:43,693 --> 01:25:46,181
Italian. You love Italian.
A toast.

1092
01:25:46,253 --> 01:25:48,836
- Happy birthday, John.
- Happy birthday, Fletcher.

1093
01:25:48,907 --> 01:25:50,053
Thanks, Alan.

1094
01:25:50,124 --> 01:25:53,571
Alan, put the newspaper down.
Come on.

1095
01:25:53,676 --> 01:25:56,836
You gonna lighten up
and be gay for a moment?

1096
01:26:15,910 --> 01:26:18,114
It's for the greater good, Alan.

1097
01:26:18,182 --> 01:26:20,516
Your life will mean something.

1098
01:26:22,502 --> 01:26:24,192
I promise.
