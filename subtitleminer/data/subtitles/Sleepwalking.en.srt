00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,501
Sheriff's office. How can I help?

2
00:00:29,531 --> 00:00:32,295
Like I said, I hadn't heard
from this woman, all right?

3
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:33,398
Problems? What the hell you talking...

4
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:37,503
You guys come and fuckin'
raid my house at 2 in the morning.

5
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:38,132
You don't even give me
a chance to get my stuff.

6
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:40,438
Throw me out? Throw me out
of my own fuckin' house?

7
00:00:40,473 --> 00:00:42,337
It's not your house, Joleen.
It's your boyfriend's house.

8
00:00:42,372 --> 00:00:43,407
That's the reason he's in jail
and you're not.

9
00:00:43,742 --> 00:00:45,436
You didn't even
give me a chance to get my stuff.

10
00:00:45,471 --> 00:00:46,608
You can come
and get your stuff later.

11
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,213
So we fine here? Can I go?

12
00:00:51,248 --> 00:00:53,545
I don't know about being fine,
but I can't hold you, so...

13
00:00:53,849 --> 00:00:55,383
Great. Where's my daughter?

14
00:00:55,418 --> 00:00:56,907
Do you even have
anywhere to take her?

15
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,152
Yeah, I got a lot of places to go to.
I got a lot of options.

16
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:06,586
Did you ever think maybe Tara'd
be better off with a more stable relative?

17
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:07,825
- I know she has a father somewhere.
- No.

18
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,488
- Just until you get on your feet.
- Just my brother, okay?

19
00:01:10,523 --> 00:01:12,595
- Your brother.
- Yeah.

20
00:01:13,266 --> 00:01:15,199
What about your parents?

21
00:01:15,234 --> 00:01:17,133
- No parents.
- No parents?

22
00:01:17,435 --> 00:01:19,561
No. All deceased. Where's Tara?

23
00:01:19,937 --> 00:01:22,201
Joleen, I know you have a father
because we talked...

24
00:01:22,473 --> 00:01:24,939
That man's got nothing to do
with any of this, all right?

25
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:28,207
- Joleen, I'm just trying to help you.
- I don't need your help.

26
00:01:28,242 --> 00:01:30,040
Can't you get that?
I don't need your help.

27
00:01:30,075 --> 00:01:30,744
- We're fine!
- You're not fine!

28
00:01:33,147 --> 00:01:36,946
You think being dragged out
in the middle of the night is fine?

29
00:01:36,981 --> 00:01:38,015
What about Tara?
Moving all over the place,

30
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,356
missing school, having people
talk about her mother is fine?

31
00:01:44,391 --> 00:01:44,721
- Okay, I've had enough.
- Oh, here we go again.

32
00:01:44,756 --> 00:01:46,451
Just drag her out
into the middle of this shit again.

33
00:01:47,725 --> 00:01:50,625
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna take my daughter to school.

34
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:53,920
You know what then? Then I'm gonna
find us a wonderful place to live, okay?

35
00:01:53,955 --> 00:01:54,863
And I have a lot of options,
by the way, okay?

36
00:01:55,364 --> 00:01:57,763
Thank you. Thanks for your help,
but I don't need it.

37
00:01:57,798 --> 00:01:58,164
Tara, let's go!

38
00:02:05,272 --> 00:02:06,932
Come on. Let's go.

39
00:02:07,808 --> 00:02:09,707
This is James.

40
00:02:09,742 --> 00:02:11,406
James. Yeah.

41
00:02:11,441 --> 00:02:13,070
Speedy. Right.

42
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,570
Is Mr. Carvel there?

43
00:02:17,782 --> 00:02:19,909
Okay. Well, could you just tell him

44
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,651
I- I can't come into work today
on account of my back?

45
00:02:23,686 --> 00:02:25,810
Still... I know.

46
00:02:37,898 --> 00:02:39,990
Okay.

47
00:02:39,999 --> 00:02:42,024
How ya doin', huh? Look at your hair.

48
00:02:43,769 --> 00:02:45,963
It's so long. You need a haircut.

49
00:02:45,998 --> 00:02:47,298
You look tired.

50
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,738
Well, it's been a shit
couple of days, all right?

51
00:02:53,944 --> 00:02:56,241
Have you gone to jail, too?

52
00:02:56,245 --> 00:02:58,474
Jail? No, James.

53
00:02:58,847 --> 00:03:01,372
- Why would I go to jail? God!
- I don't know.

54
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:06,017
- Why would I go to jail?
- I don't know.

55
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:08,612
This whole thing's got nothing
to do with me, all right?

56
00:03:12,524 --> 00:03:14,185
Okay.

57
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,759
- At all.
- Okay.

58
00:03:16,794 --> 00:03:18,351
Got nothing to do
with that shit, all right?

59
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:44,506
- Yeah. Sorry.
- Put your seatbelt on.

60
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:52,778
Tell 'em we got Joleen.
Joleen's coming back.

61
00:03:52,813 --> 00:03:52,917
Let's go, James. Come on.

62
00:03:53,356 --> 00:03:55,984
We currently have
a suspect in custody.

63
00:03:58,027 --> 00:04:00,723
It's regarding the marijuana grow...

64
00:04:00,758 --> 00:04:02,220
I brought my brother.

65
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:05,220
Hey, I'll try to watch my step.
Hey, whoa, whoa.

66
00:04:05,899 --> 00:04:08,993
Come on. I just wanna get some
of my shit, if it's not too much to ask.

67
00:04:09,028 --> 00:04:10,234
Are you gonna be calm?

68
00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:12,237
<i>We got marijuana out back.</i>

69
00:04:12,838 --> 00:04:15,328
I hope you guys are proud of yourselves.
A bunch of big men in here.

70
00:04:15,363 --> 00:04:17,234
Just get your stuff, Joleen.

71
00:04:17,675 --> 00:04:20,199
Everybody's fine putting
a little girl out on the street.

72
00:04:20,234 --> 00:04:21,868
Where's my coffee can?

73
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:24,112
Where's my goddamn coffee can?

74
00:04:24,147 --> 00:04:26,047
The last thing you need
is coffee, Joleen.

75
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:29,476
You know what I'm talking about.
Last night, when you guys came in here,

76
00:04:29,511 --> 00:04:31,110
there was a goddamn coffee can
on top of that fridge!

77
00:04:33,355 --> 00:04:35,686
It has my money in it.

78
00:04:36,757 --> 00:04:40,089
- Bob, did you see this alleged coffee can?
- No.

79
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:43,695
Pretty sure a girl like you can figure out
another way to make some money.

80
00:04:45,664 --> 00:04:47,364
Fuck you. Come on, James.

81
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:49,059
<i>The DEA's discovered</i>

82
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,727
<i>quite a few marijuana plants
out there as well.</i>

83
00:04:55,237 --> 00:04:57,501
<i>And there's also marijuana paraphernalia.</i>

84
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:06,639
<i>DEA says
it goes all the way out there...</i>

85
00:05:07,447 --> 00:05:12,816
<i>Marijuana cultivation
all the way down on the left side.</i>

86
00:05:12,851 --> 00:05:13,452
<i>DEA's got another grow...</i>

87
00:05:18,189 --> 00:05:21,590
<i>- James!
- about another half acre up there.</i>

88
00:05:26,795 --> 00:05:28,786
Let's go. Thanks a lot.

89
00:05:28,821 --> 00:05:30,663
Anybody looking?

90
00:05:35,803 --> 00:05:37,292
Uh, no.

91
00:05:44,076 --> 00:05:46,908
All right. Let's go.

92
00:06:03,023 --> 00:06:04,149
What are you looking at?

93
00:06:06,427 --> 00:06:08,656
Can I stay at your house?

94
00:06:09,129 --> 00:06:11,757
- So what are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

95
00:06:11,998 --> 00:06:14,794
Tara! Hey, put it in gear! Let's go!

96
00:06:14,829 --> 00:06:15,796
I'll see you later. Bye.

97
00:06:27,109 --> 00:06:28,599
Bye.

98
00:06:30,679 --> 00:06:34,169
Today is the first day
of the rest of your whole goddamn life.

99
00:06:38,018 --> 00:06:40,008
Moving again?

100
00:06:40,153 --> 00:06:42,212
<i>Are you all right, miss?</i>

101
00:06:42,922 --> 00:06:45,617
<i>I'm really frightened to death.</i>

102
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:49,791
<i>But otherwise all right.</i>

103
00:06:53,097 --> 00:06:55,030
Uncle James,
you're creeping me out.

104
00:06:55,365 --> 00:06:57,559
Hey, you be nice to Uncle James.

105
00:06:58,066 --> 00:07:00,694
- James, where do you keep your hangers?
- What?

106
00:07:00,729 --> 00:07:02,511
The hangers.
God, this place is some mess.

107
00:07:02,546 --> 00:07:04,294
I should've brought
some of my furniture.

108
00:07:04,472 --> 00:07:06,565
And we're gonna need another pillow
for Tara, by the way.

109
00:07:07,341 --> 00:07:10,138
I'm not sleeping in the same bed
as you, Mom.

110
00:07:10,809 --> 00:07:12,642
You know, you could really start
unpacking some of your own shit

111
00:07:12,677 --> 00:07:14,475
instead of sitting there
and pretending to do your homework.

112
00:07:16,147 --> 00:07:19,548
I'm not pretending to do my homework.
I'm pretending not to hate my life.

113
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:20,342
Well, you're not doing
a very good job of pretending.

114
00:07:20,417 --> 00:07:22,476
Well, maybe I'm not applying myself.

115
00:07:23,085 --> 00:07:25,216
I don't need this kind of shit
from you right now, Tara!

116
00:07:25,251 --> 00:07:27,347
What kind of shit do you need
from me right now, Mom?

117
00:07:27,382 --> 00:07:29,314
God, what do you want from me?

118
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:33,158
God, Tara!

119
00:07:33,193 --> 00:07:34,991
Fuck it!

120
00:08:03,551 --> 00:08:05,848
<i>Take it easy, baby face.</i>

121
00:08:06,454 --> 00:08:09,286
There are hangers in there.
I'm not gonna use them.

122
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,755
How old do I look to you, James?

123
00:08:16,894 --> 00:08:18,828
I don't know.

124
00:08:21,498 --> 00:08:23,931
That is not the right answer.

125
00:08:24,568 --> 00:08:27,558
Then what is the right answer?

126
00:08:27,593 --> 00:08:27,963
Here's a rule, okay?

127
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,897
You should listen up, because maybe
you'll find a woman for yourself.

128
00:08:34,932 --> 00:08:37,039
When a woman asks you
how old she is,

129
00:08:38,678 --> 00:08:41,544
you think,
What age does she want to be?

130
00:08:43,115 --> 00:08:45,378
And then you say that number.

131
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,611
That's the right answer.

132
00:08:53,557 --> 00:08:55,718
You look 25.

133
00:08:58,594 --> 00:09:00,528
Ya think?

134
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,229
Mm-hmm.

135
00:09:09,535 --> 00:09:12,504
25.

136
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,170
<i># What it's all about #</i>

137
00:09:18,205 --> 00:09:19,801
<i># I can't believe #</i>

138
00:09:25,681 --> 00:09:28,912
<i># That woman done burnt me out #</i>

139
00:09:29,351 --> 00:09:30,981
Don't say it.

140
00:09:31,016 --> 00:09:32,612
All right.

141
00:09:32,754 --> 00:09:34,415
- How do I look?
- Great.

142
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:35,486
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

143
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:40,351
- It's... You look great.
- Aren't you a little old for that shirt?

144
00:09:40,386 --> 00:09:41,726
Didn't I just say "Don't say it"?
I think I did.

145
00:09:41,761 --> 00:09:43,661
You're gonna watch her?

146
00:09:43,696 --> 00:09:44,289
- Yeah.
- Okay.

147
00:09:45,431 --> 00:09:47,728
- Where are you going at least?
- Out.

148
00:09:47,899 --> 00:09:49,928
Oh, my God. That's him.

149
00:09:49,963 --> 00:09:51,958
All right. Wish me luck.

150
00:09:53,137 --> 00:09:56,230
- Bye.
- Bye.

151
00:09:58,273 --> 00:10:00,639
Have a really wonderful time, Mom.

Shut up. This is my brother's place.

157
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:47,775
Baby, whoa.

158
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:49,473
Wait. Wait.

159
00:10:50,381 --> 00:10:52,871
Just for fun? Wait.

160
00:10:53,017 --> 00:10:55,576
We can say
it's the alcohol talking later.

161
00:10:56,319 --> 00:10:59,549
But just for fun, just...
just say you love me.

162
00:10:59,584 --> 00:11:02,189
Come on. Just say it.

163
00:11:02,591 --> 00:11:05,821
Doesn't have to mean anything.

164
00:11:05,856 --> 00:11:07,190
- I love you.
- Do you?

165
00:11:07,225 --> 00:11:08,928
I love your jeans.

166
00:11:09,329 --> 00:11:11,626
- Don't say that.
- I love your pants.

167
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,860
- Say it. Just say it.
- I love your underpants.

168
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:16,634
- Say it.
- I love you.

169
00:11:16,669 --> 00:11:16,899
Yeah?

170
00:11:17,769 --> 00:11:19,895
Who's the man
who always brings you flowers?

171
00:11:21,605 --> 00:11:22,936
You.

172
00:11:28,444 --> 00:11:30,645
Baby! Mmm!

173
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,840
Whoa. Wait. Wait.

174
00:11:33,248 --> 00:11:35,739
Cool your jets. Hang on.
I'll be right back.

175
00:11:38,119 --> 00:11:40,586
I'll be right back, okay?

176
00:11:56,599 --> 00:11:59,329
It's okay. It's okay, baby.

177
00:12:02,804 --> 00:12:06,034
Christ, what kind of flophouse
you runnin' here, Jojo?

178
00:12:06,069 --> 00:12:07,267
I didn't mean to cramp your style, Sly.

179
00:12:07,342 --> 00:12:09,536
Come on. Come on.

180
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:42,295
Hey.

181
00:12:43,303 --> 00:12:45,896
Hey, get any sleep?

182
00:12:48,006 --> 00:12:49,496
No.

183
00:12:53,444 --> 00:12:58,812
You know, we should've asked you
if we could stay here.

184
00:12:58,847 --> 00:12:59,171
I should've done that.

185
00:12:59,206 --> 00:13:00,237
You asked.

186
00:13:01,016 --> 00:13:03,211
You... You called me up.

187
00:13:03,246 --> 00:13:05,142
No, James.

188
00:13:05,686 --> 00:13:08,177
I remember.

189
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:17,452
It was 2:00 in the morning.
The cops were going through everything.

190
00:13:19,797 --> 00:13:22,565
I told you. I didn't ask you.

191
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,328
Well, anyway,
I'm glad you guys are here.

192
00:13:25,363 --> 00:13:25,859
Jeez.

193
00:13:26,436 --> 00:13:28,528
You know, James,
when people treat you bad,

194
00:13:31,406 --> 00:13:34,466
you shouldn't turn around and be nice.

195
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:37,736
That's not how it works.

196
00:13:39,012 --> 00:13:41,173
You're a good guy.

197
00:13:44,584 --> 00:13:46,745
You should start standing up for yourself.

198
00:13:48,986 --> 00:13:51,420
We're not with Dad anymore.

199
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:56,615
What's Dad got to do with this?

200
00:13:58,694 --> 00:14:00,526
Nothin'.

201
00:14:02,097 --> 00:14:04,326
Hey, you remember this?

202
00:14:06,366 --> 00:14:08,561
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

203
00:14:09,437 --> 00:14:12,427
That's the day we left the farm.

204
00:14:19,811 --> 00:14:23,075
He beat the shit out of me that night.

205
00:14:23,647 --> 00:14:25,308
Look at her.

206
00:14:29,252 --> 00:14:31,618
She's growing up so fast.

207
00:14:37,892 --> 00:14:40,758
I really screwed it up this time.

208
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:47,060
This is a good place for her.

209
00:14:54,971 --> 00:14:57,768
I'm just trying to say thank you, James.

210
00:14:57,803 --> 00:15:00,368
Yeah. It's...

211
00:15:10,651 --> 00:15:12,311
It's okay.

212
00:15:18,189 --> 00:15:19,679
Yeah.

213
00:15:22,793 --> 00:15:24,623
Hey.

214
00:15:25,328 --> 00:15:27,796
Um, I wouldn't go in there just...

215
00:15:29,665 --> 00:15:31,598
just yet, okay?

216
00:15:31,633 --> 00:15:33,532
Where's Mom?

217
00:15:33,567 --> 00:15:34,635
What?

218
00:15:36,337 --> 00:15:38,327
She's not here.

219
00:15:38,572 --> 00:15:40,733
Did she leave a note or anything?

220
00:15:40,768 --> 00:15:42,631
Did you see anything here?

221
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:47,240
She probably went out for smokes.
I gotta go.

222
00:15:47,275 --> 00:15:49,379
I'm late for work. Sorry.

223
00:15:49,414 --> 00:15:51,712
Hey, how you gonna get to school?

224
00:15:51,749 --> 00:15:54,012
Um, I'll just wait for her.

225
00:16:27,677 --> 00:16:29,668
Okay. Bye.

226
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,309
All right. That's lunch!

227
00:16:45,224 --> 00:16:51,059
So, Speedy, you have any idea

228
00:16:52,563 --> 00:16:56,521
where I could buy
about 2 acres worth of weed?

229
00:16:56,833 --> 00:17:00,098
Don't worry. I'm not gonna let
any of these other morons in on it.

230
00:17:00,133 --> 00:17:00,769
So what's she up to?

231
00:17:03,672 --> 00:17:05,905
Joleen in jail?

232
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:08,135
She and Tara are staying at my place.

233
00:17:08,776 --> 00:17:11,539
What? Oh, shit, man!

234
00:17:11,544 --> 00:17:14,240
You gotta have me over!

235
00:17:14,275 --> 00:17:16,480
Hey, Danni.

236
00:17:17,149 --> 00:17:20,174
You wanna have lunch
with a couple of handsome guys?

237
00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:22,084
Sure. Point 'em out for me.

238
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:25,721
Ha!

239
00:17:25,756 --> 00:17:28,622
I know you love a man in a uniform.

240
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,023
She ain't bad.

241
00:17:34,329 --> 00:17:36,319
You got trouble out there.

242
00:17:59,048 --> 00:18:02,347
He's on the other side right now.

243
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:14,687
Joleen?

244
00:19:24,348 --> 00:19:26,008
What?

245
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,182
These are yours.

246
00:19:29,217 --> 00:19:31,448
Did you see Mom?

247
00:20:33,369 --> 00:20:34,960
No.

248
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:42,266
Hey, Tara?

249
00:20:42,576 --> 00:20:44,873
Hey, come on.

250
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:48,243
She says she's got a plan.

251
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:52,646
She says she'll be back
for your birthday.

252
00:20:54,218 --> 00:20:57,983
That's... That's, uh,
just a month from now, right?

253
00:20:58,018 --> 00:20:58,277
It won't be so bad, you know?
Come on.

254
00:20:58,655 --> 00:21:00,953
L- l... I'll do whatever you want to do.

255
00:21:04,026 --> 00:21:07,961
You... You tell me what to do,
and I'll do it, okay?

256
00:21:07,996 --> 00:21:09,888
We'll have fun.

257
00:21:11,431 --> 00:21:12,921
You know, l-l...

258
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,694
I'm gonna need a ride to school...

259
00:21:17,729 --> 00:21:18,602
from now on.

260
00:21:20,005 --> 00:21:23,303
I can get a ride back here,

261
00:21:24,309 --> 00:21:26,776
but you're gonna
have to drive me to school.

262
00:21:26,811 --> 00:21:28,704
What about the bus?

263
00:21:28,845 --> 00:21:31,075
The bus doesn't come out here.

264
00:21:33,482 --> 00:21:35,915
Anyway, the bus sucks.

265
00:21:36,685 --> 00:21:39,812
I- I guess you could ride my bike
if you want.

266
00:21:39,847 --> 00:21:41,216
I'm not riding your stupid bike.

267
00:21:42,388 --> 00:21:45,721
I can barely touch the pedals.

268
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:48,792
You can drive my mom's car.

269
00:21:48,827 --> 00:21:50,818
I don't... I don't drive, though.

270
00:21:55,999 --> 00:21:58,731
And I don't think she would be
too happy about that, either.

271
00:21:58,766 --> 00:22:01,463
Then I guess I'll just sit here
in your shitty apartment

272
00:22:02,705 --> 00:22:04,332
until my mom comes back!

273
00:22:11,011 --> 00:22:13,002
Where are the gears?

274
00:22:13,747 --> 00:22:16,408
There are no gears, Uncle James.
It's an automatic.

275
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:19,645
It's way easier driving without gears.

276
00:22:20,952 --> 00:22:23,011
You just drive.

277
00:22:27,825 --> 00:22:30,792
R is reverse.

278
00:22:34,696 --> 00:22:36,027
Let's go.

279
00:22:37,733 --> 00:22:40,700
This is it. Here. Here!

280
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:47,804
Oh. Sorry.

281
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,803
Okay, Tara.

282
00:22:58,916 --> 00:23:01,416
Have a nice... day.

283
00:23:01,451 --> 00:23:03,917
Higher. Higher.

284
00:23:12,258 --> 00:23:14,659
Set them there by the jungle gym.

285
00:23:14,694 --> 00:23:17,060
I've never seen you drive before.

286
00:23:17,095 --> 00:23:17,752
Oh, yeah.

287
00:23:18,664 --> 00:23:20,995
You know Tara. She...
She had to get to school, so...

288
00:23:21,999 --> 00:23:25,264
What about her mother?
Why didn't she take her?

289
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:31,205
Oh, she's gonna be gone for a while.

290
00:23:32,275 --> 00:23:34,208
Well, where has she gone?

291
00:23:36,978 --> 00:23:38,808
I don't know.

292
00:23:40,347 --> 00:23:42,611
Don't worry.
I'm... I'm taking care of Tara.

293
00:23:43,483 --> 00:23:46,542
James, look, I think it's great
that you're trying,

294
00:23:46,577 --> 00:23:47,418
but you gotta watch it.

295
00:23:51,122 --> 00:23:54,921
You're gonna get yourself
in all sorts of shit here.

296
00:24:01,597 --> 00:24:04,998
I don't know what else to do.

297
00:24:05,033 --> 00:24:08,399
You want something else?
I can make something else.

298
00:24:10,304 --> 00:24:12,237
There's nothing here anyway.

299
00:24:18,243 --> 00:24:21,075
What do you want to do tonight?

300
00:24:35,457 --> 00:24:38,016
Can we go look for Mom tomorrow?

301
00:24:38,051 --> 00:24:39,256
After my work.

302
00:24:40,894 --> 00:24:42,558
No. In the morning.

303
00:24:42,593 --> 00:24:44,222
Well, we can't do that.

304
00:24:46,865 --> 00:24:49,800
I've... I've gotta go to work,
and you've got school, too.

305
00:24:50,569 --> 00:24:53,036
Well, you just asked me
what I wanted to do.

306
00:24:53,071 --> 00:24:53,693
Yeah, but l-l...

307
00:24:59,242 --> 00:25:01,471
So you didn't mean it?

308
00:25:03,412 --> 00:25:06,039
I want to look for Mom tomorrow.

309
00:25:06,074 --> 00:25:08,078
This is James.

310
00:25:08,113 --> 00:25:09,040
James.

311
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:11,574
Yeah. Speedy. Right.

312
00:25:12,819 --> 00:25:15,020
Is Mr. Carvel there?

313
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:17,215
Okay. Well, could you tell him,

314
00:25:19,358 --> 00:25:23,588
uh, that I can't come into work today
because of my back?

315
00:25:23,623 --> 00:25:26,296
Just... What's that? Yeah.

316
00:25:29,566 --> 00:25:32,761
I- I know. Okay.

317
00:25:34,871 --> 00:25:36,804
Can we go?

318
00:25:38,606 --> 00:25:40,540
Uncle James?

319
00:25:48,814 --> 00:25:51,077
Yeah.

320
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:53,940
Barbara!

321
00:25:56,153 --> 00:25:58,713
<i>What?</i>

322
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:03,124
And what are you two
doing here in the middle of the day?

323
00:26:03,159 --> 00:26:05,192
- We're looking for Joleen.
- Joleen?

324
00:26:05,227 --> 00:26:06,809
Well, she's not here.

325
00:26:06,844 --> 00:26:08,391
Isn't she with Warren?

326
00:26:10,598 --> 00:26:13,866
Warren's in jail, Mrs. Bergen,
if you didn't know already.

327
00:26:13,901 --> 00:26:17,130
- He was arrested for growing pot.
- No. No. He would've called.

328
00:26:17,165 --> 00:26:19,702
Have you seen my mom?
That's all we're asking.

329
00:26:21,573 --> 00:26:26,236
Tara, you know I don't ever
speak to your mother.

330
00:26:42,022 --> 00:26:46,755
Warren, you know where they might be?

331
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:48,283
Do you even know you're in jail?

332
00:26:48,794 --> 00:26:51,227
It's your fault she left
in the first place, Warren.

333
00:26:51,262 --> 00:26:52,729
This whole thing is your fault.

334
00:26:52,831 --> 00:26:54,798
I'm just wondering how long
this has been going on.

335
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,091
That's what I'd like to know.

336
00:26:59,135 --> 00:27:01,160
Do you know what Mom would call you?

337
00:27:06,074 --> 00:27:10,271
She had a name for you
when it was just me and her talking.

338
00:27:10,306 --> 00:27:12,270
She'd say it, and we'd laugh.

339
00:27:14,614 --> 00:27:17,081
Do you know what it was?

340
00:27:21,652 --> 00:27:23,882
I don't believe you.

341
00:27:23,917 --> 00:27:25,251
What was it?

342
00:27:25,489 --> 00:27:27,423
Tara, what did she call me?

343
00:27:28,492 --> 00:27:31,427
Tara, get back here, you little shit!

344
00:27:49,908 --> 00:27:53,105
What did she call me? Tara!

345
00:28:01,451 --> 00:28:03,611
Oh, shit!

346
00:28:19,565 --> 00:28:22,158
- Uh-oh.
- Shit.

347
00:28:23,568 --> 00:28:26,001
Hey!

348
00:28:27,538 --> 00:28:29,529
Give me your helmet.

349
00:28:32,575 --> 00:28:34,735
Give me that vest.

350
00:28:38,879 --> 00:28:40,870
You're done.

351
00:29:05,099 --> 00:29:07,600
- Why aren't you in school?
- I overslept.

352
00:29:07,635 --> 00:29:10,103
- Come on. I'll drive you right now.
- No, no, no.

353
00:29:10,704 --> 00:29:13,696
'Cause I'm too late already.
It's not like I have an excuse.

354
00:29:13,907 --> 00:29:17,034
- It's not like I'm sick or anything.
- Tara, you gotta go to school.

355
00:29:17,243 --> 00:29:19,507
Well, why aren't you at work?

356
00:29:19,542 --> 00:29:21,505
I got fired.

357
00:29:23,181 --> 00:29:25,740
Was it 'cause you were late today?

358
00:29:26,816 --> 00:29:28,841
No, no. It's...

359
00:29:32,055 --> 00:29:34,318
It's not just today.

360
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:37,654
If you want me to go to school,
I'll get ready,

361
00:29:41,561 --> 00:29:44,052
and then you can drive me, okay?

362
00:30:01,311 --> 00:30:03,904
Hey. All right if we come in?

363
00:30:11,318 --> 00:30:12,808
Yeah.

364
00:30:14,822 --> 00:30:17,655
You, uh, mind if we sit down and talk?

365
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:20,487
- Go ahead.
- I need to talk to Joleen, too.

366
00:30:20,522 --> 00:30:21,624
This concerns her.

367
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,955
Oh, she's not here right now.

368
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:25,092
Oh.

369
00:30:26,097 --> 00:30:28,360
Where might she be?

370
00:30:29,432 --> 00:30:31,366
I don't know.

371
00:30:33,736 --> 00:30:37,968
She said she'll be back
in about a month.

372
00:30:38,273 --> 00:30:41,106
Everything's fine here, okay?

373
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:43,399
What day is it today?

374
00:30:43,434 --> 00:30:44,668
Friday.

375
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:54,246
A school day.

376
00:30:57,488 --> 00:31:01,048
James, why isn't Tara in school today?

377
00:31:01,491 --> 00:31:03,482
We... We overslept.

378
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:07,753
Yeah. L... We...
We've had a lot going on lately.

379
00:31:07,788 --> 00:31:09,056
Yeah, I know.

380
00:31:10,931 --> 00:31:14,889
This is important.
This woman's from Social Services.

381
00:31:14,924 --> 00:31:15,800
This is the part of my job I really hate.

382
00:31:16,836 --> 00:31:20,202
Tara needs a proper guardian,
and with Joleen gone,

383
00:31:20,505 --> 00:31:24,101
I'm not so sure that it's here with you.

384
00:31:29,713 --> 00:31:31,373
I'm sorry.

385
00:31:36,017 --> 00:31:40,454
He's probably right, if you think about it.

386
00:31:40,489 --> 00:31:41,277
Don't you think?

387
00:31:44,691 --> 00:31:46,921
Tara?

388
00:31:46,926 --> 00:31:49,087
It's... It's not forever, you know?

389
00:32:01,171 --> 00:32:03,695
I- I promise.

390
00:32:54,645 --> 00:32:57,478
Okay, let's do it.

391
00:32:57,781 --> 00:33:00,841
Hey, don't worry about paying rent
or anything for a while.

392
00:33:02,651 --> 00:33:04,950
You've been fucked over enough lately.

393
00:33:04,985 --> 00:33:07,250
Go down into the basement.

394
00:33:10,492 --> 00:33:12,757
Okay, here it is.
You're welcome to it.

395
00:33:12,792 --> 00:33:15,023
Obviously not deluxe accommodations,

396
00:33:17,463 --> 00:33:21,126
but you got runnin' water,
you got a place to hang your clothes.

397
00:33:21,161 --> 00:33:23,734
That's the mattress here?

398
00:33:23,769 --> 00:33:26,566
Oh, yeah. I tried to pump it up for you.

399
00:33:26,604 --> 00:33:29,367
This damn thing...
My arm about fell off.

400
00:33:29,402 --> 00:33:30,798
Jesus Christ.

401
00:33:30,874 --> 00:33:32,933
Oh, oh, oh, oh!
Hey, how about this?

402
00:33:36,145 --> 00:33:41,343
How about we throw a party tonight
in honor of your moving in here?

403
00:33:41,378 --> 00:33:41,378
We do it up huge.

404
00:33:42,182 --> 00:33:45,948
- Are you sure Sharon's gonna be...
- Don't worry about Sharon.

405
00:33:45,983 --> 00:33:46,714
- I wear the pants in this...
- Randall!

406
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:49,285
- What, honey?
- Get your ass up here!

407
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,651
Okay, sweetie. I'm coming.

408
00:33:51,589 --> 00:33:54,190
- Now!
- All right. I gotta go.

409
00:33:54,225 --> 00:33:56,785
- You fuckin' deaf? Randall!
- Yeah, man. Just make yourself comfy.

410
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:57,554
- Now!
- Okay, baby.

411
00:33:58,529 --> 00:34:01,053
Here I come.

412
00:34:03,866 --> 00:34:05,355
Oh. Sorry.

413
00:34:06,134 --> 00:34:07,798
Is this a fucking joint?

414
00:34:07,833 --> 00:34:09,462
Now, honey...

415
00:34:12,907 --> 00:34:15,841
Sweet pea? Honey bunch?

416
00:34:16,009 --> 00:34:19,035
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

417
00:34:35,024 --> 00:34:38,323
Whew.

418
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:42,017
Oh, shit!

419
00:34:45,398 --> 00:34:47,992
Speedy Reedy.

420
00:34:48,027 --> 00:34:49,131
Hey.

421
00:34:49,368 --> 00:34:51,359
So, what, you're living here now?

422
00:34:53,205 --> 00:34:56,970
Yeah, I'm in the basement
just since today.

423
00:34:57,005 --> 00:34:58,140
What about Tara?

424
00:35:00,677 --> 00:35:05,579
Oh, uh, they said I wasn't
a proper guardian.

425
00:35:04,546 --> 00:35:04,546
Just, you know...

426
00:35:04,581 --> 00:35:07,071
- Social Services?
- Yeah.

427
00:35:07,106 --> 00:35:07,176
Yeah.

428
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:12,218
Hey, Speedy, get your ass in here!

429
00:35:12,253 --> 00:35:14,880
Go ahead. I'll go sit with Sharon.
Where is she at?

430
00:35:15,155 --> 00:35:17,987
In the kitchen, I think.
She didn't wanna play quarters.

431
00:35:18,022 --> 00:35:18,022
No kidding.

432
00:35:18,358 --> 00:35:20,416
- My God!
- Hey.

433
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:21,483
Hi, Danni.

434
00:35:22,461 --> 00:35:24,894
Your fanny is uncanny.

435
00:35:26,164 --> 00:35:28,291
Very funny, Randall.

436
00:35:33,035 --> 00:35:35,136
"Your fanny"...

437
00:35:35,171 --> 00:35:37,230
Hey, come on, Speedster.

438
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:39,297
Sit down, man.

439
00:35:40,241 --> 00:35:42,675
Sit down here under the vacancy sign.

440
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:44,839
That's it. Okay.

441
00:35:45,812 --> 00:35:48,913
Speedy!

442
00:35:48,948 --> 00:35:52,007
Speedy! Speedy! Speedy!

443
00:35:52,117 --> 00:35:55,210
Speedy! Speedy! Speedy!

444
00:35:55,245 --> 00:35:56,783
Speedy! Speedy!

445
00:36:04,227 --> 00:36:05,557
Really?

446
00:36:06,228 --> 00:36:08,162
You think that'll work?

447
00:36:08,197 --> 00:36:09,960
Mmm, I don't know.

448
00:36:10,632 --> 00:36:13,065
I doubt it, but you never know.

449
00:36:14,234 --> 00:36:16,498
I'll give it a shot for you.

450
00:36:17,037 --> 00:36:19,066
- He's pretty angry.
- Yeah.

451
00:36:19,101 --> 00:36:21,096
Yeah, well, fuck him, all right?

452
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:24,704
I'll talk to him on Monday.
I'll lay it on thick.

453
00:36:26,678 --> 00:36:31,340
He's Christian or Jewish or something
prone to guilt, but I'll just...

454
00:36:31,375 --> 00:36:33,543
We'll get your job back. Don't worry.

455
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:39,214
Hey, maybe I can just
get another job, you know?

456
00:36:39,249 --> 00:36:39,447
Well, yeah, if you can.

457
00:36:40,021 --> 00:36:42,682
There's gotta be places, right?

458
00:36:46,459 --> 00:36:48,120
Sure.

459
00:36:48,527 --> 00:36:50,518
Joleen would know what to do, you know?

460
00:36:53,131 --> 00:36:56,725
We should hold off till she gets back,
ask her what to do.

461
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:56,760
She'll know.

462
00:36:58,502 --> 00:37:01,169
Speedy, you gotta wake up, man.

463
00:37:01,204 --> 00:37:03,831
You've seen the last of her.
Joleen is gone.

464
00:37:03,866 --> 00:37:04,802
No, Randall. I told you.

465
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:10,168
She sent a letter,
sent money and everything.

466
00:37:10,203 --> 00:37:10,577
She says she's got a plan.

467
00:37:10,612 --> 00:37:12,511
She's gonna be back
for Tara's birthday.

468
00:37:13,013 --> 00:37:15,345
Okay, well, I'm on your side.

469
00:37:15,582 --> 00:37:18,073
Uh, and, actually, you're lucky

470
00:37:21,887 --> 00:37:25,219
because you don't have to
look after that kid anymore, so...

471
00:37:25,254 --> 00:37:27,390
I think I'm gonna get going.

472
00:37:27,425 --> 00:37:29,984
Danni, what? The night's a puppy.

473
00:37:30,994 --> 00:37:34,486
Yeah, well, my boys aren't gonna wait
for me if I'm slow in the morning, are they?

474
00:37:34,521 --> 00:37:36,593
See, now, that right there
is another reason why you're lucky.

475
00:37:36,628 --> 00:37:37,889
Jeez!

476
00:37:38,266 --> 00:37:40,333
Don't go gettin' dramatic on me now.

477
00:37:40,368 --> 00:37:42,393
Randall, shut up
and help me get him to bed.

478
00:37:42,428 --> 00:37:43,302
You okay?

479
00:37:43,337 --> 00:37:44,669
- Yeah.
- Come on.

480
00:37:46,273 --> 00:37:49,139
- Oh, God.
- It's harder than I thought.

481
00:37:53,278 --> 00:37:55,644
- Come on.
- Thanks, Danni.

482
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,404
Okay, watch your head now.

483
00:37:59,049 --> 00:38:02,142
Jesus, Randall,
you're making him sleep down here?

484
00:38:02,553 --> 00:38:05,987
Well, where should we have him sleep?
In bed with me and Sharon?

485
00:38:06,022 --> 00:38:07,881
Joleen's coming back
on Tara's birthday.

486
00:38:10,591 --> 00:38:13,326
Oh, yeah. Sure she is, pal.

487
00:38:13,361 --> 00:38:16,057
- She is.
- Get your head up on that pillow there.

488
00:38:16,196 --> 00:38:18,960
- Why don't you go? I can look after him.
- That's what she said.

489
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,464
Oh. Okay.

490
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:32,608
- Jeez.
- Here, honey. Roll over.

491
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:34,576
- How's that feel?
- It's good.

492
00:38:34,611 --> 00:38:35,700
Feels good?

493
00:38:43,051 --> 00:38:45,450
Yeah.

494
00:38:55,093 --> 00:38:57,084
You miss that girl, don't you?

495
00:39:00,497 --> 00:39:04,065
She's a good kid. She's a good kid.

496
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:07,534
I wanted to...
I wanted to... to tell her, you know?

497
00:39:07,569 --> 00:39:10,969
But I couldn't.
I didn't know... the words to say it,

498
00:39:11,939 --> 00:39:16,238
so all I could do was,
you know, make it fun,

499
00:39:16,273 --> 00:39:19,877
but... I couldn't even do that.

500
00:39:21,714 --> 00:39:24,375
James, it's not your fault.

501
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:24,445
Danni?

502
00:39:26,685 --> 00:39:28,676
Yes, honey.

503
00:39:41,395 --> 00:39:43,829
Can you go now, please?

504
00:39:45,499 --> 00:39:48,592
- I'll see you later, okay?
- Okay.

505
00:40:04,181 --> 00:40:05,670
Okay.

506
00:40:13,321 --> 00:40:15,787
Give me a call
when you feel like it, okay?

507
00:41:14,802 --> 00:41:16,632
Please open the door.

508
00:41:19,639 --> 00:41:22,903
Darlene, what did I tell you
about blocking the door?

509
00:41:30,314 --> 00:41:33,281
Tara, you have a visitor.

510
00:41:46,026 --> 00:41:48,688
Happy birthday.

511
00:41:49,796 --> 00:41:51,787
Why don't you open your present?

512
00:41:52,664 --> 00:41:55,461
The other girls will just take it.

513
00:41:56,034 --> 00:41:58,399
They go through my stuff at night.

514
00:42:01,271 --> 00:42:03,262
I never sleep.

515
00:42:11,979 --> 00:42:15,744
A woman at the foster place
is talking to me about adoption.

516
00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:19,317
Maybe Joleen is just...

517
00:42:19,352 --> 00:42:21,285
delayed wherever she's at.

518
00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:29,185
The woman said I might get
a family who has a regular house.

519
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:32,219
She said they might have a kids' room,

520
00:42:32,254 --> 00:42:33,986
might have a dog.

521
00:42:36,032 --> 00:42:38,022
I don't even like dogs.

522
00:42:39,335 --> 00:42:41,324
I don't care.

523
00:43:01,117 --> 00:43:03,778
I could just close my door.

524
00:43:03,813 --> 00:43:05,052
It's almost 6:00.

525
00:43:08,122 --> 00:43:12,058
I should, uh, get you back, you know?

526
00:43:13,795 --> 00:43:16,785
I'm not going back there.

527
00:43:18,899 --> 00:43:22,163
Can I stay with you?

528
00:43:22,198 --> 00:43:23,227
We can't.

529
00:43:48,321 --> 00:43:50,686
It'll just be for tonight.

532
00:44:01,398 --> 00:44:03,095
- Randall!
- Sorry, sweetie.

533
00:44:03,467 --> 00:44:06,060
No, it's not like that.
I'm, uh, just going out.

534
00:44:06,202 --> 00:44:08,400
Whatever, Speedy,
but can you just call Danni back?

535

How far could we go?

00:47:35,298 --> 00:47:37,458
I don't know. I'll figure it out.

564
00:47:37,493 --> 00:47:39,358
We could go to Mexico.

565
00:47:39,635 --> 00:47:41,829
Isn't that where you go
in this sort of situation?

566
00:47:41,864 --> 00:47:43,232
Mexico?

567
00:47:44,671 --> 00:47:46,866
Yeah. Like in the movies.

568
00:47:48,809 --> 00:47:51,777
I don't think we have enough
to get that far.

569
00:47:51,812 --> 00:47:53,744
Well, we need fake names.

570
00:47:53,913 --> 00:47:56,438
You know, so we don't get caught.

571
00:47:58,316 --> 00:48:02,649
I'll be Nicole,
and I want to be 13 years old,

572
00:48:02,684 --> 00:48:03,780
'cause being 12 is stupid.

573
00:48:04,487 --> 00:48:07,820
Yeah. Okay.

574
00:48:08,024 --> 00:48:11,481
Yeah, yeah. I'll be, uh... I'll be Randall.

575
00:48:12,693 --> 00:48:17,288
No. You have to be my dad.
Otherwise, it'll look weird to people.

576
00:48:17,323 --> 00:48:20,227
So I'll call you Dad,
and you call me Nicole.

577
00:48:24,903 --> 00:48:28,895
Okay. Yeah, yeah. Nicole.

578
00:48:30,374 --> 00:48:33,206
So where are we going to, Dad?

579
00:48:33,241 --> 00:48:34,703
You ever been to a farm?

580
00:48:34,738 --> 00:48:36,443
A real one?

581
00:48:40,215 --> 00:48:43,844
We can go to my dad's farm.
I think we have enough to get there.

582
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:44,151
The farm where you and Mom grew up?

583
00:48:47,654 --> 00:48:49,143
Yeah.

584
00:48:53,659 --> 00:48:57,526
Mom said she'd rather die
than go back there.

585
00:48:57,561 --> 00:49:00,124
There's horses.
You ever seen a horse?

586
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:02,196
At a fair once. Brown one.

587
00:49:03,067 --> 00:49:05,296
You could ride it for a dollar.

588
00:49:05,301 --> 00:49:07,461
How long a ride?

589
00:49:09,505 --> 00:49:12,702
I don't know.
I lost my dollar at the ring toss.

590
00:49:12,737 --> 00:49:13,967
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

591
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:18,800
Okay.

592
00:49:25,484 --> 00:49:27,542
Nicole.

593
00:49:27,619 --> 00:49:29,677
So there's this guy in a cabin,

594
00:49:30,687 --> 00:49:33,679
and he's got a hole in his roof,
and it's raining.

595
00:49:33,690 --> 00:49:36,058
And, uh, a traveler is walking by,

596
00:49:36,093 --> 00:49:38,424
and he says, "Hey,
you got a hole up in your roof.

597
00:49:40,196 --> 00:49:43,394
Water's gettin' in.
Why don't you patch that up?"

598
00:49:43,429 --> 00:49:46,593
He says, "Well, can't do it now
'cause it's raining."

599
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:50,964
He says, "Well, why don't you
patch it up when it's not raining?"

600
00:49:56,041 --> 00:50:00,909
And he said, "Well, when it's not raining,
then no water's coming through."

601
00:50:00,944 --> 00:50:02,509
Does it have a punch line?

602
00:50:05,115 --> 00:50:07,139
That's the joke.

603
00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:33,158
It's bad.

604
00:50:33,670 --> 00:50:35,604
Let's go!

605
00:50:42,477 --> 00:50:44,411
Hey, don't look.

606
00:50:49,849 --> 00:50:54,342
If you tell them in the right order,
they're a lot funnier, you know?

607
00:51:16,604 --> 00:51:18,264
Well...

01:02:29,328 --> 01:02:31,625
Take her out to pasture.

642
01:02:37,367 --> 01:02:39,301
Get rid of this, and then you can go.

643
01:02:39,336 --> 01:02:40,626
Hey, Dad.

644
01:02:44,873 --> 01:02:49,139
This is my daughter Nicole.

645
01:02:54,515 --> 01:02:57,948
Well, isn't this a surprise?

646
01:02:57,983 --> 01:03:01,384
State bird in California is the quail.

647
01:03:01,419 --> 01:03:02,851
State bird's a quail.

648
01:03:04,522 --> 01:03:07,957
You got the brown bear on the flag.

649
01:03:07,992 --> 01:03:11,392
What else do I know about California?

650
01:03:12,694 --> 01:03:15,891
House looks good. Looks the same.

651
01:03:15,926 --> 01:03:16,889
Joleen's got a house.

652
01:03:18,666 --> 01:03:21,294
We got a house in the country.

653
01:03:21,329 --> 01:03:22,264
A country house?

654
01:03:28,307 --> 01:03:31,241
- That's right.
- Well!

655
01:03:32,177 --> 01:03:35,044
We're more in the city part...
Nicole and me.

656
01:03:38,247 --> 01:03:40,511
And Nicole's mother.

657
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:44,050
I don't notice a ring on your finger.

658
01:03:44,319 --> 01:03:46,912
I- I lost it... a while back.

659
01:03:47,789 --> 01:03:49,449
What about the missus?

660
01:03:51,225 --> 01:03:53,625
Did you lose her, too?

661
01:03:53,660 --> 01:03:53,956
No, Dad.

662
01:04:06,503 --> 01:04:08,971
So what's the big mystery?

663
01:04:10,105 --> 01:04:11,336
She's in New York.

664
01:04:11,371 --> 01:04:12,567
In New York, huh?

665
01:04:13,843 --> 01:04:15,973
It's for her job.

666
01:04:16,008 --> 01:04:18,103
It's in computers.

667
01:04:18,847 --> 01:04:21,610
So we thought we'd take this time,

668
01:04:21,815 --> 01:04:24,716
you know, come out here for a vacation.

669
01:04:24,751 --> 01:04:24,872
Hmm.

670
01:04:26,886 --> 01:04:30,322
Nicole's never been
to a real farm before.

671
01:04:31,022 --> 01:04:35,082
So, when her mother gets back,
we'll meet up and, uh,

672
01:04:35,117 --> 01:04:36,624
take it from there.

673
01:04:36,659 --> 01:04:38,650
Joleen's living the good life, huh,

674
01:04:39,796 --> 01:04:41,855
in her magnificent country estate?

675
01:04:51,905 --> 01:04:54,430
I- I didn't say estate.

676
01:04:56,843 --> 01:05:00,777
She still livin' with that one guy?
What was his name?

677
01:05:02,146 --> 01:05:05,171
You know,
the one that knocked her up.

678
01:05:06,850 --> 01:05:08,340
No.

679
01:05:10,354 --> 01:05:12,343
What about the kid?

680
01:05:13,522 --> 01:05:15,683
She end up having it?

681
01:05:16,625 --> 01:05:18,717
I never heard...

682
01:05:24,898 --> 01:05:28,333
so you can imagine I'm kind of curious.

683
01:05:28,368 --> 01:05:28,957
No.

684
01:05:31,770 --> 01:05:36,000
Well, I got the one, though, right, Nicole?

685
01:05:38,074 --> 01:05:40,065
One grandkid's better than none.

686
01:05:40,510 --> 01:05:42,875
Well, you two better hit the sack.

687
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:48,080
Got an early rise tomorrow.

688
01:05:48,850 --> 01:05:50,942
How's she on dishes?

689
01:05:51,084 --> 01:05:53,245
Fine, I guess.

690
01:06:09,699 --> 01:06:11,189
Good.

691
01:06:12,101 --> 01:06:14,432
Rise and shine.

692
01:06:20,141 --> 01:06:22,404
Rise and shine.

693
01:08:56,629 --> 01:08:58,358
- Hey.
- Hey.

694
01:08:59,964 --> 01:09:01,898
This is Jack.

695
01:09:04,202 --> 01:09:06,294
Your mom named him that
when he was young.

696
01:09:07,304 --> 01:09:10,329
But you're a big boy now, aren't you? Huh?

697
01:09:18,146 --> 01:09:20,376
Hey, you wanna see something?

698
01:09:23,517 --> 01:09:25,507
He likes apples.

699
01:09:25,752 --> 01:09:27,912
Can I try?

700
01:09:32,224 --> 01:09:33,622
Yeah.

701
01:09:35,993 --> 01:09:39,689
- He's letting me do it.
- What are you doing?

702
01:09:39,724 --> 01:09:39,724
Feeding apples.

703
01:09:41,530 --> 01:09:44,698
- Did I say for you to do that?
- No, I was just...

704
01:09:44,733 --> 01:09:47,860
- I was showing Nicole how to...
- What happens if my horses get colic?

705
01:09:50,738 --> 01:09:53,831
You know how to take care of him
if he gets colic?

706
01:09:53,866 --> 01:09:55,673
Then maybe you should ask me

707
01:09:58,177 --> 01:10:00,838
before you start
shoving food in his mouth.

708
01:10:02,314 --> 01:10:04,305
It was my idea.

709
01:10:25,799 --> 01:10:27,733
I figured that.

710
01:10:36,141 --> 01:10:38,700
James didn't go to school much, either.

711
01:10:38,735 --> 01:10:40,469
- Right, James?
- Right.

712
01:10:41,377 --> 01:10:44,346
Had him working full time

713
01:10:45,747 --> 01:10:48,875
when he was just, uh,
a little bit older than you.

714
01:10:50,518 --> 01:10:55,217
It's not like they lost their star pupil
or anything, is it, James, huh?

715
01:11:30,683 --> 01:11:33,981
Idiot.

716
01:12:00,773 --> 01:12:03,935
See ya.

717
01:12:32,664 --> 01:12:35,394
Can I help you?

718
01:12:42,072 --> 01:12:44,005
I'm sorry.

719
01:12:51,446 --> 01:12:53,038
Nicole?

720
01:13:17,932 --> 01:13:21,925
Guess it was my mom's dress,
wasn't it?

721
01:13:56,896 --> 01:14:00,127
Come on! Come on! Feed the cattle.

722
01:14:22,183 --> 01:14:25,583
Can't you see
that that doesn't work that way?

723
01:14:25,618 --> 01:14:27,917
You didn't coil with the lay again!

724
01:14:27,952 --> 01:14:28,480
Well, I tried.

725
01:14:29,323 --> 01:14:31,755
And don't get smart with me,

726
01:14:33,058 --> 01:14:35,788
you little shit!

727
01:14:38,462 --> 01:14:42,864
- Have you... Show me yours again.
- Dad, it's getting to be suppertime.

728
01:14:42,899 --> 01:14:44,860
Not until Nicole here learns
how to coil a rope properly

729
01:14:44,901 --> 01:14:48,028
instead of running her dirty trap
all the time!

730
01:14:50,938 --> 01:14:54,669
Come on!
And go with the lay of this.

731
01:15:20,061 --> 01:15:23,552
Give me that. Go into the lay!

732
01:15:28,067 --> 01:15:29,557
Nicole.

733
01:15:31,037 --> 01:15:33,937
Nicole, come on! Get up!

734
01:16:10,767 --> 01:16:12,257
What?

735
01:16:22,977 --> 01:16:26,105
My hand is completely full of blisters.

736
01:16:32,751 --> 01:16:35,242
Here. Here, let me take a look.

737
01:16:35,277 --> 01:16:37,214
Hyah! Get in there!

738
01:16:37,249 --> 01:16:38,415
Go on! Go on!

739
01:16:44,660 --> 01:16:46,855
Why'd you bring us here?

740
01:16:51,132 --> 01:16:53,123
I thought you'd like it.

741
01:16:56,369 --> 01:16:58,894
And we were out of money.

742
01:17:00,239 --> 01:17:02,839
I didn't know where else to go.

743
01:17:02,874 --> 01:17:04,904
There's so many other places
we could've gone.

744
01:17:04,939 --> 01:17:06,934
I mean, Mom said she would
never come back here.

745
01:17:08,345 --> 01:17:11,677
- Not in a million years.
- Shh. Don't, Tara. Don't talk like that.

746
01:17:11,681 --> 01:17:13,649
It's... It's fine. Usually, he's...

747
01:17:13,684 --> 01:17:15,316
- The way he talked to us?
- Yeah.

748
01:17:15,351 --> 01:17:16,942
- And the way he treated you?
- Listen...

749
01:17:18,052 --> 01:17:20,681
- It's not fine.
- Hey, don't... don't... don't be loud, okay?

750
01:17:21,355 --> 01:17:24,585
You gotta... You gotta be quiet.
Usually, he's fine.

751
01:17:24,858 --> 01:17:28,158
It was him and your mom
that always had the problems.

752
01:17:28,193 --> 01:17:31,459
Now, he's... he's a particular
kind of... kind of man,

753
01:17:32,764 --> 01:17:37,258
but if you just keep your mouth shut
and just do the work, then it's fine.

754
01:17:37,293 --> 01:17:39,758
But your mom... she just never did.

755
01:17:40,170 --> 01:17:43,969
One day, she met this guy,
and he tried to take her away.

756
01:17:44,004 --> 01:17:46,540
Dad found out,
and he took it real hard.

757
01:17:46,575 --> 01:17:49,476
Finally, after a few months,
it got so bad between 'em,

758
01:17:49,511 --> 01:17:50,836
she was on me and on me to go,

759
01:17:51,713 --> 01:17:54,613
and so, finally, I just... I said, "Okay,"

760
01:17:55,316 --> 01:17:57,442
and we snuck out
in the middle of the night.

761
01:17:57,684 --> 01:17:59,982
- Now we're back.
- But, hey,

762
01:18:00,118 --> 01:18:02,484
don't... don't take it wrong, okay?

763
01:18:04,356 --> 01:18:08,518
It's... It's Joleen that he's always
had the problem with.

764
01:18:08,550 --> 01:18:08,553
You know?
And we won't be here long anyway.

765
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:11,753
- You promise?
- Yeah.

766
01:18:12,762 --> 01:18:16,288
Yeah, look, if we do the work now,

767
01:18:23,770 --> 01:18:27,467
then maybe he'll even give us
some money for the road.

768
01:18:27,502 --> 01:18:27,897
I wonder what happened to that guy.

769
01:18:28,841 --> 01:18:30,172
Who?

770
01:18:36,313 --> 01:18:39,873
The man Mom was gonna
run off with, you know?

771
01:18:42,385 --> 01:18:45,786
I don't know. He just...
He never came back.

772
01:18:57,931 --> 01:19:01,024
I wonder what would've happened
if she had gone with him.

773
01:19:01,059 --> 01:19:02,124
Excuse me.

774
01:19:02,668 --> 01:19:05,159
Hi, I'm... I'm Joleen Reedy.

775
01:19:07,038 --> 01:19:10,405
- My daughter, Tara Reedy, is missing.
- I gotta call you back.

776
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:13,772
If you hear anything, can you just call me
from this number here?

777
01:19:13,807 --> 01:19:16,040
Where the hell have you been?
How nice of you to show up.

778
01:19:16,712 --> 01:19:20,078
I'll take it from here.
So was that your plan, Joleen, hmm?

779
01:19:20,113 --> 01:19:21,113
Just completely abandon Tara
so she could go

780
01:19:21,148 --> 01:19:23,207
straight exactly
into what I was afraid of for her...

781
01:19:23,242 --> 01:19:23,813
Child Services?

782
01:19:25,319 --> 01:19:28,048
I mean, who the hell knows
where she's at now?

783
01:19:28,388 --> 01:19:31,380
- Please tell me something!
- I don't know.

784
01:19:31,415 --> 01:19:33,650
I don't know what to say, okay?

785
01:19:33,685 --> 01:19:33,788
I don't.

786
01:19:34,459 --> 01:19:36,392
I don't. You... You're it, okay?

787
01:19:37,529 --> 01:19:39,591
I fucked up... I fucked up, and I can't...

788
01:19:39,626 --> 01:19:41,654
I can't take it back.

789
01:19:42,465 --> 01:19:45,229
My number. You can just
call me if you hear anything.

790
01:19:48,937 --> 01:19:53,203
Joleen, you, uh...
you got someplace to stay?

791
01:19:53,238 --> 01:19:53,238
What about a job?

792
01:19:57,610 --> 01:19:59,601
I'm working on it.

793
01:20:05,250 --> 01:20:06,911
<i>The Voyager spacecraft</i>

794
01:20:08,853 --> 01:20:12,254
<i>has been exploring
uncharted territory for some time,</i>

795
01:20:12,289 --> 01:20:15,655
<i>but now it's really
going into the great beyond.</i>

796
01:20:15,690 --> 01:20:17,156
<i>Launched in 1977,</i>

797
01:20:18,927 --> 01:20:23,022
<i>Voyager has now traveled
more than 13 billion kilometers...</i>

798
01:20:23,057 --> 01:20:24,130
<i>well beyond the most distant planet.</i>

799
01:20:24,165 --> 01:20:26,428
<i>Voyager is, in fact, right on the edge</i>

800
01:20:27,534 --> 01:20:30,833
<i>of stepping into interstellar space.</i>

801
01:20:32,137 --> 01:20:36,664
<i>What it should meet there is something
called the "termination shock."</i>

802
01:20:36,699 --> 01:20:38,074
<i>This is a shock wave
where the tenuous messages</i>

803
01:20:38,642 --> 01:20:42,078
<i>of the solar wind particles
ejected by our sun</i>

804
01:20:42,945 --> 01:20:47,177
<i>run into the cosmic wind particles
floating through deep space.</i>

805
01:20:47,212 --> 01:20:48,815
<i>In fact, according to some new research,</i>

806
01:20:49,418 --> 01:20:52,519
<i>Voyager may have already
hit this shock wave.</i>

807
01:20:52,554 --> 01:20:55,613
<i>This week, two groups
announced their latest results</i>

808
01:20:55,648 --> 01:20:55,678
<i>from instruments aboard the space...</i>

809
01:20:57,023 --> 01:20:59,821
Dad, I don't know if I said it,
but it's real nice...

810
01:20:59,856 --> 01:21:00,688
you lettin' us stay here.

811
01:21:01,661 --> 01:21:04,356
So thanks.

812
01:21:04,696 --> 01:21:07,664
But, uh, work, you know...

813
01:21:09,499 --> 01:21:13,095
It's... It's real... real hard.

814
01:21:13,130 --> 01:21:14,481
You don't have to tell me.

815
01:21:14,516 --> 01:21:15,833
Especially for Nicole.

816
01:21:17,039 --> 01:21:19,974
<i>- Welcome back to the show.
- Thank you.</i>

817
01:21:21,442 --> 01:21:24,774
And this... this was gonna be a vacation.

818
01:21:24,809 --> 01:21:25,501
That was the original plan.

819
01:21:27,047 --> 01:21:29,481
Yeah, well, hoop-di-doo.

820
01:21:29,516 --> 01:21:30,982
Are you kidding?

821
01:21:33,685 --> 01:21:35,619
So I think, uh...

822
01:21:39,357 --> 01:21:43,224
we're probably gonna have to move on now.

823
01:21:43,259 --> 01:21:43,291
And I was also thinkin'

824
01:21:47,063 --> 01:21:52,693
maybe you could give us some money
for the work that we did here.

825
01:21:52,728 --> 01:21:52,728
Think that might be fair.

826
01:22:05,510 --> 01:22:08,876
I just want some money, that's all.

827
01:22:09,846 --> 01:22:13,179
Who is Tara?

828
01:22:14,851 --> 01:22:17,944
<i>Well beyond the most distant planet.</i>

829
01:22:17,979 --> 01:22:18,910
Before you came here,

830
01:22:19,521 --> 01:22:22,046
I got a little social visit...

831
01:22:22,824 --> 01:22:24,814
these guys from the sheriff's.

832
01:22:30,129 --> 01:22:34,622
And they told me a whole story
about a kid named Tara.

833
01:22:34,657 --> 01:22:35,699
That's not Tara.

834
01:22:35,734 --> 01:22:37,725
That's Nicole, and she's my daughter.

835
01:22:38,770 --> 01:22:40,168
Oh, bullshit!

836
01:22:41,204 --> 01:22:43,570
Lmagine the tree you'd be hanging from

837
01:22:44,207 --> 01:22:47,141
if I'd have called that sheriff on this.

838
01:22:50,345 --> 01:22:52,869
And where would she be?

839
01:22:56,416 --> 01:22:59,350
So as long as you're doing
all that thinking,

840
01:22:59,385 --> 01:23:00,949
why don't you think about that?

841
01:23:07,292 --> 01:23:11,728
And don't you go telling me
what you think is fair!

842
01:23:25,406 --> 01:23:27,600
You little prick!

843
01:24:17,647 --> 01:24:19,581
Hey, what's wrong?

844
01:24:19,616 --> 01:24:21,515
What are we gonna do?

845
01:24:21,550 --> 01:24:22,446
Nothing.

846
01:24:23,918 --> 01:24:26,648
We're fine for now, okay?
Let me figure something out.

847
01:24:26,683 --> 01:24:26,919
Get to work!

848
01:24:27,654 --> 01:24:29,781
And you,

849
01:24:29,855 --> 01:24:31,982
get up and get to it,

850
01:24:32,491 --> 01:24:35,051
or I'll beat your ass into next week!

851
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:37,560
What is this?

852
01:24:37,595 --> 01:24:39,960
Are you playing games with me?

853
01:24:41,599 --> 01:24:45,533
Lettin' the horses stand in
their own manure till they get thrush!

854
01:24:49,204 --> 01:24:52,330
Was that your idea?
Now get your ass in there!

855
01:24:52,372 --> 01:24:52,972
I can't...

856
01:24:53,007 --> 01:24:56,065
You don't think I can hear you?

857
01:24:58,812 --> 01:25:00,746
Now say something.

858
01:25:03,215 --> 01:25:05,979
Now you clean up that shit!

859
01:25:07,186 --> 01:25:11,086
I don't wanna see that ornery face
that you put on while you're doing it!

860
01:25:11,121 --> 01:25:11,784
Dad, she wasn't being ornery.
She was just trying to help.

861
01:25:11,819 --> 01:25:11,982
Huh?

862
01:25:13,323 --> 01:25:15,791
You don't know shit about shit!

863
01:25:17,294 --> 01:25:19,386
You stay down, James!

864
01:25:21,363 --> 01:25:25,354
Don't you fuckin' look at me, boy!
I'll split your head open like a pumpkin!

865
01:25:25,389 --> 01:25:27,896
Ya hear me?

866
01:25:30,203 --> 01:25:32,865
You put your eyes on the floor.

867
01:25:32,900 --> 01:25:34,070
Hmm!

868
01:25:34,105 --> 01:25:35,970
You think I can't break you?

869
01:25:37,809 --> 01:25:39,470
I'll break every last one of ya.

870
01:25:40,911 --> 01:25:43,177
And I'll break you of that
city-shit attitude!

871
01:25:43,212 --> 01:25:45,443
Your dirty sister and your whore of a mother

872
01:25:45,582 --> 01:25:47,549
tried to teach both of ya!

873
01:25:47,584 --> 01:25:49,517
But it won't happen again.

874
01:25:55,590 --> 01:25:58,717
Now get down there
and clean that shit up!

875
01:25:58,752 --> 01:25:59,550
You don't think I can strike you?

876
01:25:59,585 --> 01:26:00,348
- No!
- You little piece of trash!

877
01:26:00,493 --> 01:26:02,050
- Sorry!
- Huh?

878
01:26:04,029 --> 01:26:07,486
I'll spank you like I spank every horse here!

879
01:26:07,521 --> 01:26:10,563
- Don't you fuckin' touch her!
- Aah!

880
01:26:10,598 --> 01:26:13,135
You didn't break me!

881
01:26:14,337 --> 01:26:16,338
You're never breaking her!

882
01:26:16,373 --> 01:26:18,340
You hear me?

883
01:26:19,108 --> 01:26:20,597
Never!

884
01:26:37,488 --> 01:26:40,184
You piece of shit.

885
01:26:41,192 --> 01:26:43,625
You piece of shit.

886
01:26:43,660 --> 01:26:44,587
You...

887
01:26:46,896 --> 01:26:50,797
You ruined everything.

888
01:26:53,501 --> 01:26:56,060
You ruin everything!

889
01:29:21,517 --> 01:29:23,609
I want to go home.

890
01:29:26,388 --> 01:29:28,354
Aw, shit!

891
01:29:28,389 --> 01:29:30,322
Detective Woll speaking.

892
01:29:31,357 --> 01:29:34,258
<i>- Detective Woll?
- Yep, that's me.</i>

893
01:29:34,827 --> 01:29:38,226
Hi. It's, uh... It's James... Reedy.

894
01:29:38,996 --> 01:29:41,931
James, uh, where are you?

895
01:29:42,632 --> 01:29:45,100
I'm at my dad's ranch.

896
01:29:46,036 --> 01:29:47,696
But, uh...

897
01:29:48,670 --> 01:29:51,230
Yeah, he's... he's dead. I...

898
01:29:55,910 --> 01:29:57,944
<i>I killed him.</i>

899
01:29:57,979 --> 01:29:59,968
I didn't know what else to do.

900
01:30:00,414 --> 01:30:02,780
You know, he... he was going
after Tara, so...

901
01:30:03,015 --> 01:30:05,539
Oh, ok-okay. Is... Is Tara all right?

902
01:30:07,285 --> 01:30:10,487
Yeah. She... She's fine, but...

903
01:30:10,522 --> 01:30:13,456
Look, I know... I know the cops here.
They're not gonna believe me.

904
01:30:13,491 --> 01:30:16,390
They're gonna take her,
so I didn't... I didn't know what to do.

905
01:30:16,425 --> 01:30:17,684
<i>James, you listen up.</i>

906
01:30:18,961 --> 01:30:22,225
<i>For the record, we never had
this conversation, all right?</i>

907
01:30:22,260 --> 01:30:23,560
Now, I can't promise you anything,

908
01:30:23,664 --> 01:30:25,962
but if you'll bring Tara back here
and turn yourself in,

909
01:30:26,801 --> 01:30:29,861
<i>I'll do my best for you.</i>

910
01:30:30,870 --> 01:30:32,701
<i>All right?</i>

911
01:30:33,673 --> 01:30:36,401
Okay. What... What about Tara?

912
01:30:38,777 --> 01:30:41,336
<i>I'll get Joleen. Don't worry about it.</i>

913
01:30:41,371 --> 01:30:42,970
<i>James...</i>

914
01:30:43,880 --> 01:30:45,370
Okay.

915
01:31:01,527 --> 01:31:03,017
Yeah.

916
01:31:06,131 --> 01:31:07,792
Hey.

917
01:31:14,705 --> 01:31:16,195
Hey.

918
01:31:17,974 --> 01:31:19,964
Where are we going?

919
01:31:22,211 --> 01:31:25,441
You're goin' home, and to your mom.

920
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:28,676
My mom? Where is she?

921
01:31:32,853 --> 01:31:36,447
She's in Westmoreland,
waiting at the police station.

922
01:31:36,482 --> 01:31:37,788
What's gonna happen to you?

923
01:31:43,228 --> 01:31:46,856
Can't be any worse
than it's been, you know?

924
01:31:46,891 --> 01:31:48,691
Before now,

925
01:31:50,799 --> 01:31:53,563
it's like I've been living in a dream.

926
01:31:53,598 --> 01:31:54,464
Bad dreams.

927
01:31:56,738 --> 01:31:59,227
Sleepwalking.

928
01:31:59,472 --> 01:32:02,134
But you helped me.

929
01:32:02,169 --> 01:32:04,531
Woke me up.

930
01:32:05,344 --> 01:32:08,575
- I did?
- Yeah.

931
01:32:12,083 --> 01:32:13,573
You did.

932
01:32:15,986 --> 01:32:17,514
Do me a favor.

933
01:32:17,549 --> 01:32:19,043
Yeah. Sure.

934
01:32:22,824 --> 01:32:24,758
When you see her,

935
01:32:28,428 --> 01:32:29,759
tell her...

936
01:32:30,096 --> 01:32:31,689
tell her

937
01:32:34,767 --> 01:32:39,362
"This is the first day of the rest of
her life."

938
01:32:39,704 --> 01:32:43,639
Okay? It wasn't before, but now it is.

939
01:32:44,508 --> 01:32:45,997
Okay.

940
01:32:49,411 --> 01:32:51,504
Why don't you tell her?

941
01:32:56,317 --> 01:32:59,480
This is one you tell, okay?

942
01:33:03,123 --> 01:33:04,953
All right.

943
01:33:10,828 --> 01:33:12,989
You know, you're not an idiot.

944
01:33:33,379 --> 01:33:36,405
You're not an idiot,
like he would always call you.

945
01:34:01,067 --> 01:34:03,434
Tara. Tara!

946
01:34:05,605 --> 01:34:08,732
- Oh, shit!
- James!

947
01:34:10,474 --> 01:34:12,908
Jesus Christ.

948
01:34:12,943 --> 01:34:14,477
Oh, God!

949
01:34:15,145 --> 01:34:17,704
Oh, my God! Oh, my God, baby.

950
01:34:17,981 --> 01:34:20,745
I'm so sorry!

951
01:34:20,983 --> 01:34:23,918
Oh, baby!

952
01:34:24,285 --> 01:34:26,886
I'm so sorry.
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

953
01:34:26,921 --> 01:34:29,481
Tell me you're okay.
Tell me you're okay!

954
01:34:29,656 --> 01:34:31,055
- I'm okay.
- Yes? Where is James?

955
01:34:31,090 --> 01:34:32,455
Where is he?

956
01:34:32,826 --> 01:34:34,486
- Where is he?
- Gone.

957
01:34:34,521 --> 01:34:35,288
Oh, shit!

958
01:34:37,028 --> 01:34:39,896
Where is he, baby? Where did he go?

959
01:34:40,031 --> 01:34:42,966
- I don't know.
- Did he say anything?

960
01:34:43,501 --> 01:34:46,900
Yeah. Yeah, he said, um...

961
