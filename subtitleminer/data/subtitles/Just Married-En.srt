1
00:00:31,204 --> 00:00:37,757
Your attention, please. Flight 217
from Venice, Italy, now arriving at Gate 34.

2
00:00:37,844 --> 00:00:41,598
Please claim all baggage
at carousel number two...

3
00:01:12,524 --> 00:01:14,003
Hot! Hot!

4
00:01:43,684 --> 00:01:45,276
I'll be by tomorrow for my stuff.

5
00:01:46,164 --> 00:01:50,203
Call first, cos I might be having sex
with a complete stranger!

6
00:01:53,204 --> 00:01:56,162
45 minutes for a cab. This is ridiculous.

7
00:01:56,244 --> 00:01:57,677
Cheese and rice!

8
00:02:02,524 --> 00:02:07,120
Boy, you got it in there, didn't you, honey?
Thank you so much!

9
00:02:10,604 --> 00:02:13,277
I need a ride.

10
00:02:13,364 --> 00:02:15,355
Get out of my way.

11
00:02:32,604 --> 00:02:34,401
Get in!

12
00:02:45,764 --> 00:02:48,119
Try and keep it on the road for a change.

13
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:04,518
- Can't you get it any closer?
- I don't wanna scratch the paint.

14
00:03:14,124 --> 00:03:16,240
What do you do here, Tom Leezak?

15
00:03:16,324 --> 00:03:17,552
Open the gate, Yuan.

16
00:03:17,644 --> 00:03:20,397
You and Tom not together any more.

17
00:03:20,484 --> 00:03:23,123
Just open the gate, Yuan!

18
00:03:41,884 --> 00:03:43,476
That one looks heavy.

19
00:03:47,244 --> 00:03:49,519
Get thatjunk wagon out of here.

20
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,401
Right away, princess!

21
00:04:04,364 --> 00:04:06,559
Not one word.

22
00:04:08,444 --> 00:04:12,153
- Are Mom and Dad home?
- No, they're at the Emphysema Ball.

23
00:04:12,244 --> 00:04:15,873
Don't worry, Peewee.
We'll get this Tom mess cleaned up.

24
00:04:20,004 --> 00:04:21,437
Sarah...

25
00:04:33,444 --> 00:04:36,038
Kyle...

26
00:04:49,284 --> 00:04:52,913
OK, I'm home, so you can
leave whenever you want.

27
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:14,077
This is Tom and Sarah.
We can't come to the phone

28
00:05:14,164 --> 00:05:16,598
because we're honeymooning in Europe!

29
00:05:16,684 --> 00:05:21,121
Send a large wedding gift,
or we won't call you back. I'm serious.

30
00:05:22,524 --> 00:05:25,675
Kyle. I got your message.
Sorry the honeymoon sucked.

31
00:05:25,764 --> 00:05:30,792
Anyway, don't wig. When you get back,
we'll do some Budweiser therapy.

32
00:05:32,044 --> 00:05:35,241
Hi, Sarah, it's Peter.
I thought I might catch you in.

33
00:05:35,324 --> 00:05:38,873
Tom, if you're listening, buddy,
I feel your pain.

34
00:05:46,444 --> 00:05:51,074
- Where you been, man? You're on in five.
- I walked over. I had to clear my head.

35
00:05:51,164 --> 00:05:53,041
So? What happened?

36
00:05:53,124 --> 00:05:57,083
Well, I had the perfect relationship
that was ruined by marriage.

37
00:05:57,164 --> 00:06:00,998
You saw it, right? We were perfect
from the minute we met. Right?

38
00:06:01,084 --> 00:06:04,997
Yeah. In fact, it was nauseating.

39
00:06:05,724 --> 00:06:07,282
Thank you, Fred.

40
00:06:12,044 --> 00:06:15,354
Blue 28! Blue 28!

41
00:06:15,444 --> 00:06:18,242
Set! Hut!

42
00:06:19,684 --> 00:06:21,402
I'm open! I'm open!

43
00:06:24,164 --> 00:06:25,722
Football!

44
00:06:30,284 --> 00:06:31,433
Sorry!

45
00:06:32,924 --> 00:06:34,323
Are you OK?

46
00:06:34,404 --> 00:06:37,202
Yeah. You had nothin' on it.

47
00:06:43,604 --> 00:06:46,243
Cheers, Sarah McNerney.

48
00:06:46,324 --> 00:06:48,838
Cheers, Tom Leezak.

49
00:06:51,884 --> 00:06:54,557
So, what do you do
when you're not Joe Montana?

50
00:06:54,644 --> 00:06:57,522
I work at KNR Radio,

51
00:06:57,604 --> 00:07:00,641
your traffic information station.

52
00:07:01,484 --> 00:07:03,918
So I have myself a real live radio host?

53
00:07:04,004 --> 00:07:07,997
No. Someday I'll be that guy.
Sports, hopefully.

54
00:07:08,084 --> 00:07:10,723
Right now, I just do spot traffic reports.

55
00:07:10,804 --> 00:07:14,194
On the graveyard shift. Every other week.

56
00:07:14,284 --> 00:07:17,196
When the full-time guy's sick.

57
00:07:17,284 --> 00:07:20,321
- You're that Tom.
- Yeah. You heard me on the air?

58
00:07:20,404 --> 00:07:23,476
Yeah, I called in about a week ago.
Like, 3am.

59
00:07:23,564 --> 00:07:26,601
You said the Pasadena freeway
was clear, so I took it,

60
00:07:26,684 --> 00:07:32,680
and got stuck behind ajackknifed big rig
for, like, three hours. Yeah.

61
00:07:32,764 --> 00:07:34,800
Sarah from Beverly Hills.

62
00:07:35,684 --> 00:07:38,437
Who called me a fathead.

63
00:07:39,204 --> 00:07:41,320
We got pretty heated.

64
00:07:41,404 --> 00:07:42,837
Very heated.

65
00:07:45,324 --> 00:07:48,316
So, 3am? That's past your bedtime, is it?

66
00:07:48,404 --> 00:07:53,034
How do you know? I was wrapping out
an auction. I'm a gofer at Sotheby's.

67
00:07:53,124 --> 00:07:57,640
Let me guess: Marketing major, Stanford.
Smartypants in the front row.

68
00:07:57,724 --> 00:08:01,399
- Art history major, Wellesley, back row.
- Oh, back row.

69
00:08:01,484 --> 00:08:04,954
Sweet! Me too. Communications,
Burbank Community College.

70
00:08:05,044 --> 00:08:07,239
- Wanna hear the fight song?
- No, thank you.

71
00:08:07,324 --> 00:08:09,599
- I'm really good at it.
- No, really. Thanks.

72
00:08:09,684 --> 00:08:11,675
That's a good choice.

73
00:08:12,644 --> 00:08:14,794
McNerney.

74
00:08:14,884 --> 00:08:19,162
You're not, by any chance,
the daughter of Dan McNerney,

75
00:08:19,244 --> 00:08:23,237
part-owner-of-the-Lakers-and-Dodgers
McNerney?

76
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:25,956
I'll take that as a yes.

77
00:08:26,524 --> 00:08:28,913
Ready to get your ass kicked at eight-ball?

78
00:08:30,564 --> 00:08:34,523
You are dreaming, Wellesley.
I went to day care in a pool hall.

79
00:08:35,324 --> 00:08:37,315
Pretty confident there, huh, fathead?

80
00:08:44,684 --> 00:08:47,152
Bags, shh.

81
00:09:28,644 --> 00:09:32,080
And that was it.
A month later, we moved in together.

82
00:09:33,484 --> 00:09:38,000
Why did we get married when we had loving
each other so completely nailed?

83
00:09:38,084 --> 00:09:39,995
I don't know. Ten seconds.

84
00:09:40,084 --> 00:09:41,642
Why does anyone get married?

85
00:09:41,724 --> 00:09:47,003
I mean, does it make sense to be
with one person for your entire life?

86
00:09:48,084 --> 00:09:50,723
People change. They grow.

87
00:09:50,804 --> 00:09:51,839
You're on, Tom.

88
00:09:52,644 --> 00:09:56,762
Maybe we'd still be together if I'd
gotten the proposal right, but, nope,

89
00:09:56,844 --> 00:09:59,312
the proposal is critical, and I blew it.

90
00:10:04,884 --> 00:10:10,880
This is Tom Leezak
with KNR traffic at 2.06am.

91
00:10:10,964 --> 00:10:16,197
At this hour, there are approximately
seven vehicles on all Southland freeways,

92
00:10:16,284 --> 00:10:20,914
so if you feel like skateboarding
down the 405, she's wide-open.

93
00:10:21,004 --> 00:10:24,394
Stay tuned for another
traffic update in ten minutes

94
00:10:24,484 --> 00:10:29,638
on KNR, your traffic information station.

95
00:10:30,644 --> 00:10:34,319
And we're out. Look here, Tom.
You gotta focus, all right, man?

96
00:10:34,844 --> 00:10:38,553
Forget about proposals.
Forget about marriage. All right?

97
00:10:45,404 --> 00:10:46,883
Bags...

98
00:10:49,564 --> 00:10:54,240
Do you have to grunt all the time?
You're just like a little pig with hair.

99
00:10:55,804 --> 00:10:59,160
Look at me.
I'm the cutest doggy in the world.

100
00:10:59,244 --> 00:11:04,364
I'm the cutest doggy in the world. Throw
the ball for me. I'll pull on your leg all day.

101
00:11:04,444 --> 00:11:07,004
Bags, seriously, I will...

102
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:08,676
Bags, I'm reading.

103
00:11:12,564 --> 00:11:14,043
Fetch.

104
00:11:24,404 --> 00:11:26,713
It wasn't like Bags to chase pigeons.

105
00:11:29,404 --> 00:11:32,237
This pigeon was cruel. It was...

106
00:11:33,964 --> 00:11:38,116
Bags, he just went for him.

107
00:11:39,204 --> 00:11:41,195
He was taunting.

108
00:11:42,684 --> 00:11:46,154
And squawking.

109
00:11:46,244 --> 00:11:48,883
Squawking?

110
00:11:48,964 --> 00:11:51,319
Squawking.

111
00:11:51,404 --> 00:11:54,680
I mean, at first, it was more of a purring.

112
00:11:55,844 --> 00:11:58,916
You know how they...
I mean, Bags... It got his attention.

113
00:11:59,004 --> 00:12:01,438
He has a low tolerance for annoyances.

114
00:12:01,524 --> 00:12:04,641
But then it turned into this, like, shrill...

115
00:12:16,684 --> 00:12:18,675
You're lying.

116
00:12:19,644 --> 00:12:23,159
- What?
- Your nostrils always flare when you lie.

117
00:12:23,244 --> 00:12:25,394
Flare! Flare!

118
00:12:25,484 --> 00:12:29,113
They're not flaring. I'm not lying.

119
00:12:32,964 --> 00:12:37,799
Honey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm just really overwhelmed.

120
00:12:39,204 --> 00:12:42,116
Promise we'll never lie to each other.

121
00:12:44,484 --> 00:12:46,839
It's a promise.

122
00:12:53,044 --> 00:12:55,478
I love you so much.

123
00:13:01,244 --> 00:13:03,394
Listen, Sarah...

124
00:13:03,924 --> 00:13:06,757
I wanna marry you, Tom Leezak.

125
00:13:09,484 --> 00:13:11,520
I wanna marry you, too.

126
00:13:22,564 --> 00:13:26,557
Why do you bring Dodge to front?
Park at service entrance!

127
00:13:26,644 --> 00:13:29,158
Open the gate, Yuan.

128
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:32,043
Here we go!

129
00:13:44,764 --> 00:13:47,324
Well, well, well...

130
00:13:49,364 --> 00:13:51,673
What a surprise.

131
00:13:59,804 --> 00:14:03,592
- Welcome to the family, Tom.
- Thank you, Mrs McNerney.

132
00:14:03,964 --> 00:14:05,920
Oh, you can call me Pussy now.

133
00:14:06,004 --> 00:14:09,394
Thank you, Pussy.

134
00:14:09,484 --> 00:14:13,443
Well, wonderful. Wonderful!

135
00:14:13,524 --> 00:14:15,992
Yuan, champagne for everybody!

136
00:14:17,844 --> 00:14:19,482
Knock it off, Dickie!

137
00:14:20,724 --> 00:14:25,275
Peewee. My youngest daughter.

138
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,639
You little rebel.

139
00:14:28,684 --> 00:14:31,721
And you, Tom Leezak. You're...

140
00:14:32,524 --> 00:14:35,243
Well, wonderful surprise.

141
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:38,154
Thank you, Mr McNerney.

142
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:41,793
I just hope that I can

143
00:14:41,884 --> 00:14:45,957
be just all that I can be

144
00:14:47,644 --> 00:14:50,602
in this family.

145
00:14:56,844 --> 00:15:00,041
Well, I love Sarah.

146
00:15:00,124 --> 00:15:01,876
<i>That's all I need to know.</i>

147
00:15:03,724 --> 00:15:06,796
You really missed the boat,
didn't you, Prentiss?

148
00:15:06,884 --> 00:15:07,953
Yes, I did, Dan.

149
00:15:08,044 --> 00:15:10,353
You bet your ass you did.

150
00:15:10,444 --> 00:15:14,915
I should've been courting Sarah instead
of putting in 19-hour days at the office.

151
00:15:15,004 --> 00:15:18,713
Anyway, congratulations. To both of you.

152
00:15:18,804 --> 00:15:21,113
Seriously, from my heart.

153
00:15:21,204 --> 00:15:23,195
Thank you, Peter.

154
00:15:24,044 --> 00:15:27,320
- You're a lucky man.
- Hey, I know that.

155
00:15:27,404 --> 00:15:29,395
Grab a flute of bubbly and rise.

156
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:33,995
Everybody ready?

157
00:15:34,364 --> 00:15:38,073
- Why is Peter Prentiss here?
- Dad's doing business with him.

158
00:15:38,164 --> 00:15:41,395
All right. Health, wealth, happiness.

159
00:15:41,484 --> 00:15:43,952
Health, wealth, happiness.

160
00:15:45,084 --> 00:15:48,281
All right, Peewee. Ten-yard out.

161
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:53,722
Leezak, give me a five-yard slant.
You got this, man. Don't worry about it.

162
00:15:53,804 --> 00:15:55,874
- Calm down.
- What do you mean, calm down?

163
00:15:55,964 --> 00:16:00,719
Why do bad things happen to good people,
Father? Where's that in your book?

164
00:16:00,804 --> 00:16:03,034
- She's determined.
- Not even Catholic!

165
00:16:03,124 --> 00:16:06,878
- He's a Polack! A Polack.
- I know, and I warned you...

166
00:16:06,964 --> 00:16:09,194
Let's see what Leezak's packing.

167
00:16:09,284 --> 00:16:11,844
Ready? All right. And break!

168
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:14,395
- On one. Ready?
- Break!

169
00:16:18,124 --> 00:16:20,638
You girls ready for this?

170
00:16:22,204 --> 00:16:23,398
Down!

171
00:16:25,564 --> 00:16:26,553
Set!

172
00:16:31,644 --> 00:16:33,282
That was a hard one.

173
00:16:34,004 --> 00:16:35,960
- Yeah!
- That's what I'm talkin' about!

174
00:16:36,044 --> 00:16:38,114
- What are you doing, Willie?
- I slipped.

175
00:16:39,924 --> 00:16:43,519
I still got my flag. I'm good. I'm good.

176
00:16:44,844 --> 00:16:47,881
Oh, my Peewee. Always moving so fast.

177
00:16:47,964 --> 00:16:52,799
You move in together after a month,
live together for nine months,

178
00:16:52,884 --> 00:16:55,352
and now you're engaged.

179
00:16:55,444 --> 00:16:58,004
I know you love him, but, you know,

180
00:16:58,084 --> 00:17:02,839
sometimes it takes more than love
to sustain a marriage.

181
00:17:04,444 --> 00:17:06,878
You need to be old enough
to know who you are

182
00:17:06,964 --> 00:17:09,000
and what you want and who he is.

183
00:17:09,084 --> 00:17:12,474
Oh, Mom, he's wild and spontaneous

184
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:14,998
and hysterical and offbeat,

185
00:17:15,084 --> 00:17:18,793
and on top of all that,
he's centred, and he's down-to-earth.

186
00:17:18,884 --> 00:17:23,116
He's everything I want. And we have
this passion for each other that's...

187
00:17:27,604 --> 00:17:29,401
I'm jealous.

188
00:17:31,244 --> 00:17:34,361
All right. First thing tomorrow,

189
00:17:36,684 --> 00:17:39,073
we're gonna plan this wedding!

190
00:18:02,644 --> 00:18:03,838
Hey, you.

191
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:21,515
So I guess everyone thinks
we're crazy for doing this.

192
00:18:21,604 --> 00:18:24,994
Now when did we start caring
about what other people think?

193
00:18:26,804 --> 00:18:32,242
Well, are you sure that you don't
wanna marry a guy like Peter?

194
00:18:33,524 --> 00:18:38,996
If I wanted to know exactly what
my life would be from hereon out,

195
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:42,440
I would marry a guy like Peter.

196
00:18:42,524 --> 00:18:45,118
But I love not knowing.

197
00:18:45,204 --> 00:18:50,676
I love our messy loft, your beater car.

198
00:18:53,524 --> 00:18:56,277
I wanna start a life with you.

199
00:18:56,364 --> 00:18:57,717
Sarah?

200
00:18:57,804 --> 00:18:59,999
Go! Go!

201
00:19:03,444 --> 00:19:05,275
Hi, Daddy.

202
00:19:09,204 --> 00:19:14,562
Peewee, marriage is like
a business investment.

203
00:19:14,644 --> 00:19:20,401
Its long-term viability
is best established unemotionally.

204
00:19:20,484 --> 00:19:25,239
Bottom line, Daddy: We love each other.
That is all that matters.

205
00:19:40,044 --> 00:19:41,159
Good night, sir.

206
00:19:44,964 --> 00:19:47,319
Congratulations, Mr Leezak!

207
00:19:47,404 --> 00:19:50,555
Big Daddy Leezak's in the house!

208
00:19:52,484 --> 00:19:54,952
Oh, I hope she doesn't spook on you, man.

209
00:19:55,804 --> 00:19:57,283
What do you mean?

210
00:19:57,364 --> 00:20:01,835
I love Sarah, don't get me wrong.
But rich chicks spook.

211
00:20:01,924 --> 00:20:05,963
A powerful daddy plus family money
equals expectations.

212
00:20:06,044 --> 00:20:09,275
Expectations are like
a fungal rot on a marriage.

213
00:20:10,284 --> 00:20:13,242
Our marriage is not gonna have a fungal rot.

214
00:20:13,324 --> 00:20:17,033
We're gonna be happily married
every day for the rest of our lives.

215
00:20:18,324 --> 00:20:22,363
Unless she finds out
that you slaughtered her dog.

216
00:20:22,444 --> 00:20:24,275
I'll take that to my grave.

217
00:20:30,444 --> 00:20:34,801
OK, if you change your mind
at the altar, just pass out.

218
00:20:34,884 --> 00:20:37,318
I'm not going to change my mind.

219
00:20:37,404 --> 00:20:40,635
I'm just saying, if you do, just hit the floor.

220
00:20:40,724 --> 00:20:43,238
Thank you. But it's not gonna happen.

221
00:20:43,844 --> 00:20:46,597
You're sure you're ready
to give up your grazing rights?

222
00:20:46,684 --> 00:20:48,322
I'm not a grazer, Kyle.

223
00:20:48,404 --> 00:20:50,679
What if you became one later in life?

224
00:20:50,764 --> 00:20:55,918
I mean, over the next ten years,
you're giving up five hayrides per year.

225
00:20:56,004 --> 00:21:00,043
So I can either be happily married
to Sarah, or have 50 one-night stands.

226
00:21:00,124 --> 00:21:03,719
- Minimum.
- That's not even a choice.

227
00:21:05,324 --> 00:21:08,077
OK, let's move on.

228
00:21:08,164 --> 00:21:11,793
Are there any chicks you didn't have
that you wish you had?

229
00:21:11,884 --> 00:21:14,079
You are, like, the worst best man ever!

230
00:21:14,164 --> 00:21:15,756
Peter!

231
00:21:17,804 --> 00:21:20,193
I can't believe she invited Prentiss.

232
00:21:20,284 --> 00:21:22,718
- Glad you made it, buddy.
- Hey, man.

233
00:21:22,804 --> 00:21:25,602
Did she ever hook up with that yahoo?

234
00:21:26,884 --> 00:21:30,513
They went backpacking in Europe once,
just after high school.

235
00:21:30,604 --> 00:21:33,118
I don't think anything happened.

236
00:21:33,204 --> 00:21:39,200
Whoa. You're getting married,
and she didn't share the roster?

237
00:21:41,084 --> 00:21:43,040
She shared the roster.

238
00:21:45,764 --> 00:21:48,881
Merrick and Bruce.

239
00:21:53,644 --> 00:21:55,475
What about Prentiss?

240
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:01,878
And you never asked again?

241
00:22:01,964 --> 00:22:04,842
I won. It's irrelevant.

242
00:22:06,724 --> 00:22:12,356
Oh. OK. As long as you're OK
with a bogus roster.

243
00:22:12,444 --> 00:22:15,004
- It's not a bogus roster!
- Is he on or is he off?

244
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:16,563
He's...

245
00:22:17,804 --> 00:22:19,795
- Shut up.
- Huh? Huh?

246
00:22:23,964 --> 00:22:25,477
And you could've had Peter.

247
00:22:25,564 --> 00:22:28,203
I did have Peter, and it wasn't that hot. OK?

248
00:22:29,924 --> 00:22:32,313
Excuse me?

249
00:22:32,404 --> 00:22:35,521
I was in Seattle, helping at an appraisal.

250
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:39,074
Ran into Peter. We went out.
I drank way too much,

251
00:22:39,164 --> 00:22:43,840
and before I knew it, we tussled.

252
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:46,878
You bad girl.

253
00:22:47,484 --> 00:22:51,079
I wanted to tell Tom so many times,
but he gets so jealous.

254
00:22:51,164 --> 00:22:53,883
Listen, it doesn't matter
that he doesn't know.

255
00:22:53,964 --> 00:22:56,637
It's not like you were married,
and even if you were...

256
00:22:56,724 --> 00:22:59,318
No, no, no. It matters to me.

257
00:22:59,404 --> 00:23:03,079
It's like living a lie. I cannot live a lie.

258
00:23:03,164 --> 00:23:07,123
There will always be this
big fat elephant in the room with us.

259
00:23:07,204 --> 00:23:09,764
Listen, Peewee, never tell him.

260
00:23:12,204 --> 00:23:13,762
It's time to go, Sarah.

261
00:23:15,324 --> 00:23:17,315
Come on.

262
00:23:18,444 --> 00:23:19,877
- Got everything?
- Yes.

263
00:23:19,964 --> 00:23:21,192
How are you holding up?

264
00:23:21,284 --> 00:23:24,162
Pussy's a mess.
I'm telling you now, be prepared.

265
00:23:59,324 --> 00:24:00,837
Wait.

266
00:24:08,684 --> 00:24:10,402
- Oh, are you OK?
- Yes.

267
00:24:10,484 --> 00:24:13,442
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

268
00:24:13,524 --> 00:24:16,277
This threshold thing isn't as easy as it looks.

269
00:24:24,124 --> 00:24:28,197
Daddy got the big suite! Yeah, he did!

270
00:24:35,604 --> 00:24:38,562
We're really married.
We're really, really married.

271
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:40,635
For ever and ever.

272
00:24:43,204 --> 00:24:45,320
Do you feel like it?

273
00:24:45,404 --> 00:24:48,316
I don't know. Do you?

274
00:24:50,524 --> 00:24:52,913
I'm kinda tired.

275
00:24:54,004 --> 00:24:55,995
Me too.

276
00:24:57,044 --> 00:24:59,239
- I mean, hey...
- OK.

277
00:25:09,844 --> 00:25:11,835
What's the matter?

278
00:25:13,204 --> 00:25:16,276
It's our wedding night,
and we don't wanna have sex.

279
00:25:17,204 --> 00:25:20,196
No... Well, it's OK.

280
00:25:21,444 --> 00:25:24,561
We're tired. It's fine.

281
00:25:24,644 --> 00:25:27,204
Baby, it's just that this is our wedding day,

282
00:25:27,284 --> 00:25:30,037
something I've fantasised
about my whole life.

283
00:25:33,884 --> 00:25:36,239
And now it's over.

284
00:25:40,204 --> 00:25:43,833
Did you have wedding fantasies
when you were a little boy?

285
00:25:49,884 --> 00:25:51,237
Kinda.

286
00:25:51,324 --> 00:25:53,713
Oh, honey.

287
00:25:53,804 --> 00:25:58,002
Oh, my God! Tomorrow my parents
are gonna know I'm not a virgin any more!

288
00:26:00,124 --> 00:26:03,196
Oh... You haven't been
a virgin since college.

289
00:26:03,284 --> 00:26:07,800
I know. I know. But tomorrow they're
gonna know for sure that I'm not a virgin.

290
00:26:07,884 --> 00:26:12,162
And they're gonna know
that you deflowered me. Oh, God! Oh, no!

291
00:26:12,244 --> 00:26:13,962
- Oh, honey!
- Deflowered?

292
00:26:14,044 --> 00:26:16,922
That's what my mom always called it.
My mommy.

293
00:26:24,244 --> 00:26:27,156
I love you. OK?

294
00:26:27,244 --> 00:26:32,159
And we have our entire lives to have sex.

295
00:26:33,164 --> 00:26:36,600
So it's OK if we don't do it tonight.

296
00:26:42,284 --> 00:26:43,876
Now I kinda feel like it.

297
00:26:43,964 --> 00:26:46,353
- Really?
- Yeah.

298
00:26:46,444 --> 00:26:48,241
That was a sexy speech.

299
00:26:48,324 --> 00:26:52,158
I, you know, turn it on
every once in a while.

300
00:26:55,924 --> 00:26:57,915
Oh, bloody nose! Bloody nose!

301
00:26:58,004 --> 00:27:01,076
Oh, hello, hello! Hello, hello!

302
00:27:01,164 --> 00:27:03,155
Here you go.

303
00:27:05,444 --> 00:27:09,153
You've been mine for one night,
and you're falling apart already.

304
00:27:09,244 --> 00:27:11,838
I'm not gonna have to trade ya in, am I?

305
00:27:14,284 --> 00:27:17,833
There you go. Just like that.
It'll stop the bleeding.

306
00:27:20,084 --> 00:27:22,154
I look like a chimp.

307
00:27:24,084 --> 00:27:26,075
You look gorgeous.

308
00:27:27,924 --> 00:27:30,233
Let's go to sleep.

309
00:27:32,724 --> 00:27:35,522
- I love you.
- I love you, too, baby.

310
00:28:26,804 --> 00:28:29,238
Sweetie, our plane leaves in an hour.

311
00:28:35,564 --> 00:28:38,954
OK, so that wasn't
the smoothest start to a honeymoon.

312
00:28:39,804 --> 00:28:45,242
But tomorrow we will be at the foot
of the Alps at the Hôtel des Rêves.

313
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:47,713
- Yes, we will.
- It'll be totally perfect.

314
00:28:47,804 --> 00:28:50,682
Yes, it sounds totally perfect.

315
00:28:53,524 --> 00:28:55,515
But I can't wait until then.

316
00:29:09,844 --> 00:29:11,835
Jimmy-crack-corn!

317
00:29:17,644 --> 00:29:19,680
Close it, bitch!

318
00:29:22,404 --> 00:29:24,838
There's a lock on the door
for a reason, Junior.

319
00:29:24,924 --> 00:29:27,392
I'm claustrophobic, OK?

320
00:29:27,484 --> 00:29:28,599
Do we have a problem?

321
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:30,197
- No.
- No, no problem.

322
00:29:30,284 --> 00:29:32,002
- We're just waiting.
- Yeah.

323
00:29:41,444 --> 00:29:45,642
Mexican food. That's an oxymoron.

324
00:29:51,244 --> 00:29:53,997
Sweet Lord! Where does that come from?

325
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:55,995
- Let's just wait.
- Oh, my gosh.

326
00:29:56,084 --> 00:29:59,599
...has turned on the "fasten seat belt" sign.

327
00:29:59,684 --> 00:30:01,640
Kindly return to your seats.

328
00:30:01,724 --> 00:30:05,399
OK... Breathe through your mouth.
Breathe through your mouth.

329
00:30:05,484 --> 00:30:07,679
- No, it's really bad.
- Just do it!

330
00:30:11,884 --> 00:30:13,033
Hurry up!

331
00:30:16,644 --> 00:30:18,999
OK, OK, let me just...

332
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:28,838
This is gonna work. This is gonna work.

333
00:30:30,004 --> 00:30:32,837
- I'm gonna step on the toilet.
- OK, perfect.

334
00:30:41,964 --> 00:30:44,683
- What?
- The crapper's got my foot.

335
00:30:44,764 --> 00:30:46,641
- Wait. Let me help.
- Sarah...

336
00:30:46,724 --> 00:30:49,238
OK, OK, one, two, three.

337
00:30:54,604 --> 00:30:55,878
Return to your seats.

338
00:30:55,964 --> 00:30:58,273
- Be right out. OK, you OK?
- Yeah.

339
00:30:58,364 --> 00:31:01,515
OK, wait. OK, one, two, three.

340
00:31:02,484 --> 00:31:04,873
Return to your seats now, please.

341
00:31:04,964 --> 00:31:07,114
Beat it, stew!

342
00:31:09,444 --> 00:31:10,877
Return...

343
00:31:14,324 --> 00:31:19,000
Playtime is over, children.
Return to your seats! Do you hear me?

344
00:31:19,084 --> 00:31:20,722
- Let's flush it.
- I'll pull.

345
00:31:25,204 --> 00:31:26,432
I can't get it out!

346
00:31:26,524 --> 00:31:29,197
The captain has turned on
the "fasten seat belt" sign!

347
00:31:29,284 --> 00:31:32,037
Wait, wait, wait. Here.
Ready? One, two, three.

348
00:31:42,844 --> 00:31:47,360
- We can tell the grandchildren about that.
- Great story for the kids.

349
00:31:51,884 --> 00:31:54,034
<i>- Bonjour.
- How you doing, chief?</i>

350
00:31:54,124 --> 00:31:57,002
<i>Can we get le car for Leezak?</i>

351
00:31:58,164 --> 00:32:02,123
<i>Bonjour. Les réservations sont pour Leezak.</i>

352
00:32:02,204 --> 00:32:04,195
<i>Oui, mademoiselle.</i>

353
00:32:04,844 --> 00:32:09,122
- You never told me you spoke French.
- It was that summer I went to Europe.

354
00:32:09,204 --> 00:32:12,514
Ah, here we are. For Mr and Mrs Leezak.

355
00:32:12,604 --> 00:32:14,754
Must be some mistake, no?

356
00:32:14,844 --> 00:32:16,835
No, no mistake. Mr and Mrs.

357
00:32:18,804 --> 00:32:19,839
What the hell?

358
00:32:19,924 --> 00:32:22,961
- These sports scores are two days old.
- So?

359
00:32:23,044 --> 00:32:26,559
So? You know if I don't have
an up-to-date sports section,

360
00:32:26,644 --> 00:32:29,522
it throws off my day,
starting with my morning dump.

361
00:32:29,604 --> 00:32:32,835
Honey, there's gonna be
satellite TV in the hotel.

362
00:32:36,564 --> 00:32:37,838
<i>Voilà.</i>

363
00:32:37,924 --> 00:32:40,916
Ah. I wonder what kind of wheels we got.

364
00:32:42,044 --> 00:32:45,593
I'm telling you, this is not the car.
I ordered a compact.

365
00:32:45,684 --> 00:32:47,163
This is a European compact.

366
00:32:47,244 --> 00:32:51,032
This is a Ringling Brothers compact.
I've owned bigger Tonka trucks.

367
00:32:51,124 --> 00:32:53,274
Honey, I looked at the brochure,

368
00:32:53,364 --> 00:32:57,994
and there was a Fiesta
on the cover, not a Bingo.

369
00:32:59,564 --> 00:33:02,601
Baby needs a great big car
to make him happy?

370
00:33:02,684 --> 00:33:05,676
We could really use a Dodge about now.

371
00:33:05,764 --> 00:33:08,995
We could really use a Dodge about now.

372
00:33:10,564 --> 00:33:11,997
What was that?

373
00:33:12,084 --> 00:33:13,881
You just sound so American.

374
00:33:13,964 --> 00:33:16,762
We could use a Dodge about now.

375
00:33:16,844 --> 00:33:19,961
While I'm makin' a doody,
can you hand me my sports section?

376
00:33:20,044 --> 00:33:21,955
Thank you very much, ma'am.

377
00:33:23,044 --> 00:33:25,114
Are you mocking me?

378
00:33:25,204 --> 00:33:27,559
No. Baby, just floor it.

379
00:33:27,644 --> 00:33:31,876
I am flooring it. If I pushed any harder,
my foot would blow through the floor,

380
00:33:31,964 --> 00:33:34,114
and we'd be Flintstoning there.

381
00:33:34,204 --> 00:33:36,274
Whoa, turn here!

382
00:33:44,324 --> 00:33:45,643
- You OK?
- Yeah. You?

383
00:33:49,764 --> 00:33:54,679
If you'd told me about the turn before, I
wouldn't have had to pull such a manoeuvre!

384
00:33:54,764 --> 00:33:58,279
I was busy looking at the map!
Somebody had to navigate.

385
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:09,043
Listen to us. We sound
like an old married couple.

386
00:34:11,244 --> 00:34:13,235
Never again.

387
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:23,637
Just for the record, why did I
almost get us killed back there?

388
00:34:24,484 --> 00:34:26,520
Because that's our hotel.

389
00:34:27,724 --> 00:34:31,319
- It looks like a castle.
- It is a castle.

390
00:34:31,404 --> 00:34:34,237
Then that's precisely why it looks like one.

391
00:34:36,004 --> 00:34:37,676
Let's go.

392
00:34:56,564 --> 00:35:00,921
This is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.

393
00:35:02,684 --> 00:35:04,675
Let's go.

394
00:35:17,844 --> 00:35:21,837
Look, baby, look. It comes with free nuns.

395
00:35:41,284 --> 00:35:43,240
<i>- Vous êtes Américains?
- Oui.</i>

396
00:35:43,324 --> 00:35:46,316
Welcome to Hôtel des Rêves.
I am Henri Margeaux.

397
00:35:46,404 --> 00:35:48,713
<i>Nous sommes Sarah et Tom Leezak.</i>

398
00:35:48,804 --> 00:35:50,123
<i>- Leezak, no!
- Oui.</i>

399
00:35:50,204 --> 00:35:52,001
<i>- The honeymooners?
- Oui.</i>

400
00:35:52,084 --> 00:35:54,723
<i>- No!
- Oui. Why?</i>

401
00:35:54,804 --> 00:35:58,399
So fresh and young to have marriage, no?

402
00:35:58,484 --> 00:36:00,475
No. We're married.

403
00:36:00,924 --> 00:36:03,484
I almost forget.

404
00:36:03,564 --> 00:36:06,078
Ooh, presents.

405
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:09,474
"Congratulations.
Have a wonderful honeymoon. Love...

406
00:36:10,204 --> 00:36:12,035
Peter."

407
00:36:12,124 --> 00:36:14,592
That's a platonic "love".

408
00:36:16,164 --> 00:36:18,473
Forget about Peter.

409
00:36:18,564 --> 00:36:20,555
Here. Please enjoy.

410
00:36:21,684 --> 00:36:24,198
Room, all upstairs.

411
00:36:24,284 --> 00:36:27,242
<i>François, les bagages, en haut.
Tout de suite, s'il vous plaît.</i>

412
00:36:36,524 --> 00:36:38,754
Tell me this isn't your fantasy.

413
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:43,042
This is better than my fantasy.

414
00:36:43,124 --> 00:36:45,513
Good, cos we're paying out the ass for it.

415
00:36:45,604 --> 00:36:48,676
Honey, just for the record,
when you talk about money,

416
00:36:48,764 --> 00:36:53,838
especially it coming out of your heinie,
it sort of kills the romance of the moment.

417
00:36:54,444 --> 00:36:56,162
Right. Sorry.

418
00:36:58,844 --> 00:37:03,793
Now fight your deep urge to be cheap,
and give the bellboy a large tip.

419
00:37:03,884 --> 00:37:04,999
All right.

420
00:37:05,084 --> 00:37:09,441
- Hey, do you guys provide satellite TV?
- TV in bar.

421
00:37:10,844 --> 00:37:14,473
- So there's no TV in this room?
- TV in bar.

422
00:37:17,564 --> 00:37:20,522
<i>- Ask him if they have ESPN.
- Pour I'amour de Dieu.</i>

423
00:37:20,604 --> 00:37:23,676
<i>Je lui ai dit, à monsieur,
que la télé est dans le bar.</i>

424
00:37:24,004 --> 00:37:28,361
<i>Je crois que sa femme n'est pas vous.
C'est la télé.</i>

425
00:37:31,044 --> 00:37:33,638
He said the TV's in the bar.

426
00:37:37,604 --> 00:37:42,155
He also said that if he were here with me,
he wouldn't be concerned with TV.

427
00:37:44,124 --> 00:37:45,557
He makes a point.

428
00:37:45,644 --> 00:37:50,001
- I gotta call Mom and Dad.
- Talk about killing the romance.

429
00:37:50,084 --> 00:37:52,882
I told them I'd call. It'll just take a minute.

430
00:37:54,724 --> 00:37:57,033
Hi, Mom? It's Peewee.

431
00:37:57,124 --> 00:37:58,876
Say hi to Pussy for me.

432
00:38:02,644 --> 00:38:04,157
Tom says hello.

433
00:38:04,724 --> 00:38:07,192
Yeah. Oh, it's so great.

434
00:38:09,884 --> 00:38:14,958
"To Tom and Sarah.
Enhance thy honeymoon. Love, Kyle."

435
00:38:15,524 --> 00:38:17,515
I'll call you later, Mom. Bye.

436
00:38:18,844 --> 00:38:21,916
Cheese and rice.
Is that a Thunderstick A200?

437
00:38:22,004 --> 00:38:23,801
Since when did you become an expert?

438
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:27,957
- I told you about that night I had in college.
- Not about the hardware.

439
00:38:28,044 --> 00:38:30,194
Getting a visual?

440
00:38:31,564 --> 00:38:33,919
We gotta charge this thing.

441
00:38:41,484 --> 00:38:45,762
- That plug won't fit in a European outlet.
- I'll make it fit.

442
00:38:48,804 --> 00:38:49,953
Come on.

443
00:38:50,044 --> 00:38:51,033
Don't force it.

444
00:39:02,964 --> 00:39:04,761
Are you OK? Are you OK?

445
00:39:04,844 --> 00:39:09,395
Holy dude Jesus. Good thing that
didn't happen when we were using it.

446
00:39:11,684 --> 00:39:12,753
Oh, God.

447
00:39:12,844 --> 00:39:16,120
<i>Allez dans la cour,
s'il vous plaît, tout de suite.</i>

448
00:39:16,204 --> 00:39:18,479
Come on! Come on, Thunderstick!

449
00:39:18,564 --> 00:39:22,034
- Oh, no. OK, just leave it.
- Let's go, let's go, let's go.

450
00:39:47,924 --> 00:39:52,440
My grandparents
installed the wiring in the hotel

451
00:39:52,524 --> 00:39:55,163
before World War First!

452
00:39:57,044 --> 00:40:02,801
It worked fine, until you young kids had
to bring out your toys and ignore the sign!

453
00:40:08,124 --> 00:40:10,638
That is the...

454
00:40:10,724 --> 00:40:14,603
- That's in French, for chrissakes.
- That's because we're in France.

455
00:40:14,684 --> 00:40:17,835
- Is there anything we could do?
- Pay the damages.

456
00:40:17,924 --> 00:40:19,243
Hold on there, Jacques.

457
00:40:19,324 --> 00:40:22,077
<i>Je m'appelle Henri Margeaux.</i>

458
00:40:22,164 --> 00:40:26,316
Whatever! Look, this hotel gets
guests from all over the world.

459
00:40:26,404 --> 00:40:29,282
It's your responsibility
to put American on your signs.

460
00:40:29,364 --> 00:40:30,638
He means English.

461
00:40:30,724 --> 00:40:33,238
I'm trying to negotiate.

462
00:40:33,324 --> 00:40:35,440
So I must make my hotel of dreams

463
00:40:35,524 --> 00:40:38,436
like every Howard Johnson's,
with a bright orange roof?

464
00:40:38,524 --> 00:40:41,721
<i>- It wouldn't hurt.
- Imbécile de cochon d'Américain.</i>

465
00:40:41,804 --> 00:40:44,876
<i>- Cochon what?
- Stupid American pig.</i>

466
00:40:48,764 --> 00:40:54,157
Well, I guess that makes you
a stupid French frog!

467
00:40:54,244 --> 00:40:56,200
Oh, yeah. I said it. Frog!

468
00:40:56,284 --> 00:40:58,434
Get out of my Hôtel des Rêves!

469
00:40:58,524 --> 00:41:01,800
I wouldn't stay in this dump if you paid us!

470
00:41:02,644 --> 00:41:05,397
- Let's go to the Ho Jo's.
- There are no Ho Jo's here.

471
00:41:05,484 --> 00:41:07,156
Sarah, please!

472
00:41:07,244 --> 00:41:11,362
There is a farm up the road.
And they have a nice pigsty for you!

473
00:41:11,444 --> 00:41:14,516
Yeah? Maybe they'll have
a nice little bulldozer,

474
00:41:14,604 --> 00:41:17,721
and we can finish this place off, tough guy!

475
00:41:17,804 --> 00:41:21,160
And the credit bill will be
a fat one, Mr Tough Guy!

476
00:41:21,244 --> 00:41:25,681
Yeah? Well, we're keeping the champagne
and the cheese, Jacques-strap!

477
00:41:27,324 --> 00:41:28,882
Let's go, honey.

478
00:41:30,604 --> 00:41:32,595
What's wrong?

479
00:41:33,604 --> 00:41:36,243
Where are we gonna stay, Tom?

480
00:41:36,324 --> 00:41:39,714
Don't worry. This is a vacation zone.
We'll find a place.

481
00:41:39,804 --> 00:41:41,681
Now get your shit. Let's go.

482
00:41:42,724 --> 00:41:44,555
What's the next place?

483
00:41:44,644 --> 00:41:50,435
The next hotel with no vacancy
would be Schloss Hilliger Winterswald.

484
00:41:50,524 --> 00:41:53,357
- How far is it?
- 120 kilometres.

485
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:55,321
In miles, please!

486
00:41:55,404 --> 00:41:58,316
74.4. You multiply by 0.6.

487
00:41:58,404 --> 00:42:02,158
- I'm learning so much.
- Oh, me too. Me too.

488
00:42:08,804 --> 00:42:10,362
Let me guess...

489
00:42:16,844 --> 00:42:19,312
This is great. This is just what we need.

490
00:42:19,404 --> 00:42:23,079
- Do you want me to drive?
- Honey, I can drive in the snow.

491
00:42:25,724 --> 00:42:27,919
Turn off your brights, jackass!

492
00:42:58,764 --> 00:43:02,757
Great. Now we get to freeze to death.

493
00:43:05,484 --> 00:43:10,763
Look, we'll just... We'll sleep in here
and we'll dig out in the morning.

494
00:43:10,844 --> 00:43:14,678
I'm so glad I get to hear the phrase
"We'll dig out" on my honeymoon.

495
00:43:19,804 --> 00:43:22,159
Just get it over with now and blame me.

496
00:43:22,244 --> 00:43:27,034
If you hadn't insulted Henri, we wouldn't
be spending the evening in a snowball.

497
00:43:27,124 --> 00:43:32,482
I'm sorry. Next time, I'll try to be a little
bit more refined like your friend Peter.

498
00:43:32,564 --> 00:43:35,237
- Good night, Tom.
- Good night, Sarah.

499
00:44:09,804 --> 00:44:11,920
Are you gonna hate me for ever?

500
00:44:14,524 --> 00:44:16,719
I don't know.

501
00:44:20,524 --> 00:44:22,116
Wanna get drunk and make out?

502
00:44:22,204 --> 00:44:25,833
Well, that's not gonna get me drunk,
but we could make out.

503
00:44:30,964 --> 00:44:33,922
We could get injured doing this.

504
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:37,474
I'll settle for a cuddle.
Just let me get the shifter out of my ass.

505
00:44:48,084 --> 00:44:51,042
Sarah... It's morning.

506
00:45:09,964 --> 00:45:12,080
Oh, my God.

507
00:45:15,564 --> 00:45:17,600
- Oh, my...
- Oh, my God.

508
00:45:17,684 --> 00:45:19,436
It's incredible.

509
00:45:19,844 --> 00:45:24,156
- Let's just stay here for the rest of the trip.
- Fine with me.

510
00:45:31,164 --> 00:45:33,200
- Hey! Help!
- Excuse me!

511
00:45:37,404 --> 00:45:39,872
Blue car, blue car!

512
00:45:40,924 --> 00:45:41,754
It worked.

513
00:46:12,644 --> 00:46:16,319
We can catch the two o'clock train to Venice
and go straight to the Gianna.

514
00:46:16,404 --> 00:46:20,283
- Our reservation isn't until Tuesday.
- So we'll stay a few extra days.

515
00:46:20,364 --> 00:46:22,639
I just put a castle on my credit card.

516
00:46:22,724 --> 00:46:25,875
We can't afford to stay at the Gianna
for a few extra days.

517
00:46:25,964 --> 00:46:28,842
So I'll call my dad up,
and he'll lend us the money.

518
00:46:28,924 --> 00:46:32,075
No, there's no way
I'm taking money from your dad.

519
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:34,439
Pride is the crutch of the insecure.

520
00:46:34,524 --> 00:46:37,243
You are not taking the money.
I am taking the money.

521
00:46:37,324 --> 00:46:41,363
No, we don't need to take the money.
This is about us now.

522
00:46:41,444 --> 00:46:45,073
<i>My dad told me about this
nice little pensione in Venice...</i>

523
00:46:45,164 --> 00:46:46,358
<i>Pensione?</i>

524
00:46:46,444 --> 00:46:49,436
<i>- Großes Scheißhaus.
- Excuse me.</i>

525
00:46:49,524 --> 00:46:51,401
Could you just drive?

526
00:46:51,484 --> 00:46:53,076
Please just let me call my dad.

527
00:46:53,164 --> 00:46:56,281
No! This is our honeymoon, not his.

528
00:46:56,364 --> 00:46:59,913
<i>So it's fine to stay at a pensione
that your father recommended?</i>

529
00:47:00,004 --> 00:47:03,792
We're staying at the Pensione Funicello,
and we'll have a good time.

530
00:47:03,884 --> 00:47:07,923
I can't take this any more! Honeymoons
are supposed to be all champagne

531
00:47:08,004 --> 00:47:11,633
and room service and lovemaking!
We haven't made love!

532
00:47:11,724 --> 00:47:14,682
No. What do we get?
We get evicted from a five-star hotel

533
00:47:14,764 --> 00:47:18,473
and, to boot, I'm yelling at you!
We're yelling at each other.

534
00:47:18,564 --> 00:47:23,115
We're not yelling at each other. I'm
the one yelling. I'm sorry, I wanna go home.

535
00:47:23,204 --> 00:47:25,001
Maybe we should go home.

536
00:47:25,084 --> 00:47:28,360
I know this honeymoon hasn't been perfect,

537
00:47:28,444 --> 00:47:32,960
<i>but I'm sure the pensione is gonna be fine.
Look, we'll check in, sleep late,</i>

538
00:47:33,044 --> 00:47:36,673
eat pasta, gaze out at the Piazza del...

539
00:47:37,884 --> 00:47:39,875
something-something.

540
00:47:40,764 --> 00:47:42,117
It's gonna be heaven.

541
00:47:52,324 --> 00:47:54,599
Pensione Funicello?

542
00:47:58,844 --> 00:48:01,074
Are you sure?

543
00:48:03,284 --> 00:48:05,002
How bad could it be?

544
00:48:08,684 --> 00:48:10,481
Aw, crap.

545
00:48:17,684 --> 00:48:19,834
We're in this together, right?

546
00:48:21,924 --> 00:48:25,473
Do you have four men staring
at your boobies right now?

547
00:48:30,964 --> 00:48:32,317
No.

548
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:09,196
Yeah, just...

549
00:49:09,284 --> 00:49:12,799
You know, we'll try it for one night,
and if we don't...

550
00:49:12,884 --> 00:49:15,034
Live.

551
00:49:15,124 --> 00:49:20,482
...like it, we'll, you know,
go somewhere nicer tomorrow.

552
00:49:29,724 --> 00:49:32,318
This is actually happening!

553
00:49:36,884 --> 00:49:39,762
We're never gonna forget this honeymoon.

554
00:50:10,084 --> 00:50:11,722
Sorry.

555
00:50:35,844 --> 00:50:38,312
We can show those paisanos how it's done.

556
00:50:42,924 --> 00:50:45,518
Cockroach, cockroach, cockroach!

557
00:50:45,604 --> 00:50:47,993
Oh, honey! Honey, honey! I'll get him!

558
00:50:50,204 --> 00:50:53,116
Let's get outta here, please!

559
00:50:53,204 --> 00:50:55,593
- We're checking out!
- I don't wanna touch it!

560
00:50:55,684 --> 00:50:57,481
Get it off me!

561
00:51:01,604 --> 00:51:03,754
Thanks for the help, Daddy.

562
00:51:04,844 --> 00:51:07,722
I miss you.

563
00:51:09,764 --> 00:51:11,561
Honey, he wants to talk to you.

564
00:51:11,644 --> 00:51:16,001
Can't you just tell him thank you from
all of us here at the gorgeous Gianna?

565
00:51:24,844 --> 00:51:26,755
Hello there, Mr McNerney.

566
00:51:26,844 --> 00:51:30,598
Please bear in mind that
our daughter loves him, Dan.

567
00:51:30,684 --> 00:51:36,634
Listen, Leezak, I don't expect
a cracker like you to ever measure up

568
00:51:36,724 --> 00:51:40,399
to anything approaching what I'd consider
a good match for my daughter.

569
00:51:40,484 --> 00:51:42,236
But I'll tell you what I do expect.

570
00:51:42,324 --> 00:51:46,761
I expect you to pay me back in full just as
soon as that silly-ass radio show of yours

571
00:51:46,844 --> 00:51:48,960
yields any kind of reasonable income.

572
00:51:49,044 --> 00:51:51,239
Goodbye, cracker.

573
00:51:53,084 --> 00:51:55,234
Ass-bag!

574
00:51:55,324 --> 00:51:57,884
- What was that?
- He called me a cracker!

575
00:51:57,964 --> 00:52:00,114
A cracker, honey!

576
00:52:00,204 --> 00:52:02,195
He did not.

577
00:52:02,284 --> 00:52:06,402
That surprises you? Your dad hates me.
"Well, wonderful, wonderful."

578
00:52:06,484 --> 00:52:09,999
He's got your whole family
praying that this marriage fails.

579
00:52:10,084 --> 00:52:12,552
Mom's never said a bad word about you.

580
00:52:12,644 --> 00:52:16,956
Wow, Pussy's never insulted me!
Now I feel loved.

581
00:52:17,044 --> 00:52:19,433
Like your father's neverjudged me?

582
00:52:19,524 --> 00:52:22,516
No, he hasn't. Not once.

583
00:52:28,804 --> 00:52:30,522
Maybe we should just have sex.

584
00:52:30,604 --> 00:52:34,153
Call me crazy, but I'm just
not in the mood to make love.

585
00:52:36,364 --> 00:52:40,960
I'm not, either. But we haven't had sex once
since we've been married,

586
00:52:41,044 --> 00:52:44,116
and there is something
very, very wrong with that.

587
00:52:44,204 --> 00:52:47,116
And I have to tell you... It's not funny!

588
00:52:47,204 --> 00:52:49,434
I'm sorry.

589
00:52:49,524 --> 00:52:51,754
I'm concerned.

590
00:52:51,844 --> 00:52:57,601
Let's go to sleep. We'll get a good rest,
we'll sightsee tomorrow.

591
00:52:57,684 --> 00:52:59,675
Be fresh in the morning.

592
00:53:01,324 --> 00:53:02,882
Fine.

593
00:53:04,444 --> 00:53:06,719
And then we'll have sex.

594
00:53:57,364 --> 00:54:01,482
Imagine Ernest Hemingway sitting
right over there at the Caffè Florian,

595
00:54:01,564 --> 00:54:06,115
just sipping a single malt,
dreaming up his next masterpiece.

596
00:54:09,604 --> 00:54:11,720
Those birds are psychotic.

597
00:54:13,124 --> 00:54:15,843
History doesn't interest you at all, does it?

598
00:54:15,924 --> 00:54:20,952
Huh? Yeah, it does. I wasn't an art history
major, though, so it's not like...

599
00:54:21,044 --> 00:54:24,480
You don't have to be an art history major
to appreciate art.

600
00:54:24,564 --> 00:54:27,283
- Whoa, whoa.
- What? What?

601
00:54:27,364 --> 00:54:29,434
Do you hear that?

602
00:54:29,524 --> 00:54:33,119
The bells? No? What is it, honey?

603
00:54:33,204 --> 00:54:35,195
What?

604
00:54:35,964 --> 00:54:37,682
What?

605
00:54:37,764 --> 00:54:38,913
What?

606
00:54:39,004 --> 00:54:42,076
What are we listening to?

607
00:54:43,404 --> 00:54:45,793
What? What is it? I can help.

608
00:54:45,884 --> 00:54:49,001
- It's a message from God. It's a mes...
- God?

609
00:54:50,564 --> 00:54:53,032
There's a ground ball...

610
00:54:53,124 --> 00:54:54,921
Jackpot!

611
00:54:56,764 --> 00:54:59,358
Honey, we still have to see the Tintorettos.

612
00:55:01,284 --> 00:55:06,312
Oh, the church art is unbelievable,

613
00:55:06,404 --> 00:55:08,872
but it all kinda looks the same to me.

614
00:55:10,444 --> 00:55:13,117
You know I love sports.

615
00:55:13,204 --> 00:55:16,674
I mean, I'm a sports freak.
But how often are we in Europe?

616
00:55:16,764 --> 00:55:19,597
How often are the Dodgers on TV in Europe?

617
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:26,835
You're right. You go watch sports.
I'll go see the Tintorettos.

618
00:55:36,764 --> 00:55:38,277
- Honey...
- Yeah?

619
00:55:38,364 --> 00:55:43,358
Is this a loving act of generosity,
or am I gonna pay for this later?

620
00:55:44,164 --> 00:55:46,758
Does it make a difference?

621
00:55:46,844 --> 00:55:49,916
I'm gonna make this up to you huge. Huge.

622
00:55:50,004 --> 00:55:53,792
Tonight, everything is your choice.
Dinner in a church, if you want.

623
00:55:58,764 --> 00:56:00,482
- Meet you at the hotel.
- Love you!

624
00:56:00,564 --> 00:56:02,759
<i>I love you.</i>

625
00:56:45,724 --> 00:56:47,680
Peter?

626
00:56:47,764 --> 00:56:50,995
- Peewee? What a surprise!
- What are you doing here?

627
00:56:51,084 --> 00:56:52,403
- In Venice?
- Yes.

628
00:56:52,484 --> 00:56:58,480
Nextron's buying out Ferrugia Chocolate,
so they sent me in to close the deal.

629
00:56:58,564 --> 00:57:02,955
- Did you get that cognac I sent you?
- Yes. I thought it a tad inappropriate.

630
00:57:03,884 --> 00:57:06,193
I'm sor... I didn't...

631
00:57:06,284 --> 00:57:08,878
I'm just trying to be the gallant loser here.

632
00:57:08,964 --> 00:57:11,034
- Peter...
- Why don't we celebrate?

633
00:57:11,124 --> 00:57:13,240
I'll take you guys to dinner.

634
00:57:13,324 --> 00:57:15,633
I'm on my honeymoon.

635
00:57:15,724 --> 00:57:18,079
- My honeymoon.
- Right, right, right.

636
00:57:18,164 --> 00:57:20,280
See? Yeah.

637
00:57:20,364 --> 00:57:22,719
I can be so thick sometimes. I'm sorry.

638
00:57:22,804 --> 00:57:26,080
I got a lot of work to do anyway,
so I'm going to disappear.

639
00:57:26,164 --> 00:57:27,597
But you guys have fun.

640
00:57:27,684 --> 00:57:29,242
Peter, wait.

641
00:57:29,324 --> 00:57:30,757
I'm...

642
00:57:30,844 --> 00:57:33,199
I don't mean to be rude.

643
00:57:34,204 --> 00:57:36,195
You couldn't be rude if you tried.

644
00:57:36,924 --> 00:57:39,882
How's the honeymoon?
It's good? It's a dream?

645
00:57:39,964 --> 00:57:41,317
- It's great.
- Yeah?

646
00:57:41,404 --> 00:57:43,998
- Oh, yeah, great.
- Where's Tom?

647
00:57:44,084 --> 00:57:47,394
Oh, he's at the church with...

648
00:57:49,564 --> 00:57:53,716
He's a huge history buff. Yeah.

649
00:57:55,324 --> 00:58:00,193
- It's good you guys share that passion.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

650
00:58:12,244 --> 00:58:16,601
<i>Fredo, I need to know where
that little signora is at all times.</i>

651
00:58:17,324 --> 00:58:20,077
Very bold, Mr Prentiss.

652
00:58:25,964 --> 00:58:28,603
The Dodgers won! The Dodgers won!

653
00:58:28,684 --> 00:58:30,675
The Dodgers won, honey.

654
00:58:31,764 --> 00:58:36,599
See? I knew you were gonna make me pay
for watching the game.

655
00:58:36,684 --> 00:58:39,994
No. No, it's not that.

656
00:58:41,244 --> 00:58:42,836
We need to talk.

657
00:58:45,324 --> 00:58:47,474
About what?

658
00:58:47,564 --> 00:58:49,555
Have you always told me the truth?

659
00:58:49,644 --> 00:58:53,000
Yeah. Except the time I told you
I liked your brother Willie.

660
00:58:53,084 --> 00:58:55,723
<i>- This is serious.
- I am serious. I don't like him.</i>

661
00:58:55,804 --> 00:58:58,876
- Marriage is built on honesty and trust.
- I agree.

662
00:58:58,964 --> 00:59:02,400
Did you ever do something
that you wanted to tell me about,

663
00:59:02,484 --> 00:59:05,157
but you couldn't
because you felt bad about it?

664
00:59:05,244 --> 00:59:07,997
And the more time went on,
the harder it was to tell me,

665
00:59:08,084 --> 00:59:12,202
and it turned into this big fat lie,
so you kept not telling me about it...

666
00:59:12,284 --> 00:59:14,718
Did you talk to Kyle?

667
00:59:14,804 --> 00:59:17,113
- No. Why?
- No reason.

668
00:59:17,204 --> 00:59:19,843
- Does he know something I should know?
- No.

669
00:59:19,924 --> 00:59:21,880
- You covered your nose.
- I had an itch.

670
00:59:21,964 --> 00:59:25,274
You were hiding flared nostrils.
What do you have to tell?

671
00:59:29,404 --> 00:59:31,759
It's just

672
00:59:31,844 --> 00:59:34,153
when Bags died,

673
00:59:34,244 --> 00:59:38,954
he didn't exactly die
the way that I described it.

674
00:59:39,044 --> 00:59:43,720
Him chasing the squawking pigeons
off the balcony?

675
00:59:43,804 --> 00:59:45,601
That.

676
00:59:45,684 --> 00:59:47,481
What happened?

677
00:59:47,564 --> 00:59:51,318
Well... OK, I'm reading my magazine,

678
00:59:51,404 --> 00:59:53,838
and I'm focusing, and I'm really into it.

679
00:59:53,924 --> 00:59:57,075
And along comes Bags.
He comes trucking over,

680
00:59:57,164 --> 01:00:01,476
and he starts tugging on my ankle.

681
01:00:01,564 --> 01:00:04,442
And I was, like, "Bags, I'm..." I was like...

682
01:00:04,764 --> 01:00:07,995
I think I even said "I'm trying to focus."

683
01:00:08,084 --> 01:00:13,556
And he looked up at me and gave me the
"Hey, are you gonna play with me or not?"

684
01:00:13,644 --> 01:00:17,319
I was, like, "Yeah, I really just
wanna read, though, Bags."

685
01:00:17,404 --> 01:00:20,521
And he started pulling at my ankle again,

686
01:00:20,604 --> 01:00:24,313
and so I grabbed the ball
and I was, like, "Go get it, buddy."

687
01:00:24,404 --> 01:00:29,432
I threw the ball over my shoulder, it went
out the window, Bags dove, and he died.

688
01:00:30,484 --> 01:00:32,122
You killed Bags?

689
01:00:32,204 --> 01:00:35,560
- It was an accident.
- And you lied about it all this time?

690
01:00:36,444 --> 01:00:40,198
- Actually, it was more of an omission.
- No, it was more like a lie!

691
01:00:40,724 --> 01:00:42,237
Where are you going?

692
01:00:42,324 --> 01:00:45,999
- I have to figure out what to do with this.
- What does that mean?

693
01:00:46,084 --> 01:00:48,723
I can deal with you
being cheap and a shitty driver.

694
01:00:48,804 --> 01:00:51,682
I cannot deal with you being a liar!

695
01:00:52,684 --> 01:00:55,403
Wait a second.

696
01:00:55,484 --> 01:00:58,635
This started with you
wanting to talk about something.

697
01:00:58,724 --> 01:01:01,238
Well, I don't wanna talk about it right now.

698
01:01:02,204 --> 01:01:04,399
So you feel guilty about something, too.

699
01:01:04,484 --> 01:01:08,841
Yes, there is something I "omitted"
that I don't wanna talk about right now.

700
01:01:08,924 --> 01:01:11,757
You want a marriage
based on trust and honesty?

701
01:01:11,844 --> 01:01:14,074
Well, here's your chance! Come on!

702
01:01:14,164 --> 01:01:17,156
Yeah, yeah, you got it! I can see it! Bring it!

703
01:01:17,244 --> 01:01:19,633
I slept with Peter Prentiss.

704
01:01:24,804 --> 01:01:25,793
What?

705
01:01:25,884 --> 01:01:29,160
- I slept with Peter...
- I heard you.

706
01:01:29,244 --> 01:01:31,394
- I'm sorry.
- I need to hear everything.

707
01:01:31,484 --> 01:01:33,714
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do. That's what I do.

708
01:01:33,804 --> 01:01:35,840
I need to know everything.

709
01:01:35,924 --> 01:01:39,712
Where you were, what he did,
how small his wiener was. Everything.

710
01:01:39,804 --> 01:01:43,638
- I was helping on an appraisal in Seattle...
- I don't wanna hear it!

711
01:01:46,364 --> 01:01:49,037
- You slept with that...
- It was a long time ago.

712
01:01:49,124 --> 01:01:50,398
- When?
- Before we...

713
01:01:50,484 --> 01:01:51,553
- Got married?
- Yes!

714
01:01:51,644 --> 01:01:52,633
- Engaged?
- Of course.

715
01:01:52,724 --> 01:01:56,319
- Got together?
- Yes... No, no.

716
01:01:56,404 --> 01:01:59,680
It was right after we met.
My parents were pressuring me to...

717
01:01:59,764 --> 01:02:03,200
Aha. Imagine my surprise.

718
01:02:05,444 --> 01:02:08,402
I was confused. I'm in Seattle.

719
01:02:08,484 --> 01:02:11,556
He asked me out to dinner.
The champagne is flowing...

720
01:02:11,644 --> 01:02:13,874
Please, try not to break into song.

721
01:02:14,284 --> 01:02:19,233
My feelings for you were very, very strong,

722
01:02:19,324 --> 01:02:21,633
and I needed to know that they were real.

723
01:02:21,724 --> 01:02:25,478
I wasn't brought up to manage
feelings like that very well.

724
01:02:25,564 --> 01:02:29,682
Yeah. You had a real tough upbringing.

725
01:02:32,844 --> 01:02:35,802
- I need some air.
- Yeah? Me too.

726
01:02:35,884 --> 01:02:38,557
Happy now? You broke it.

727
01:02:38,644 --> 01:02:40,839
By the way, Peter's staying at the hotel.

728
01:02:40,924 --> 01:02:42,960
That's funny!

729
01:02:48,524 --> 01:02:50,242
- Hooker!
- Murderer!

730
01:03:11,044 --> 01:03:14,081
- What's the score?
- 3-2, top of the ninth.

731
01:03:17,124 --> 01:03:19,843
Are you American?

732
01:03:19,924 --> 01:03:21,152
Good guess.

733
01:03:55,844 --> 01:03:57,755
Where's Tom?

734
01:03:57,844 --> 01:04:01,120
We don't feel the need to be
with each other all the time.

735
01:04:06,684 --> 01:04:10,996
I just find it odd that
you're spending so much time apart

736
01:04:11,084 --> 01:04:13,075
on your honeymoon.

737
01:04:16,124 --> 01:04:18,160
Are you OK?

738
01:04:18,244 --> 01:04:21,759
Peter, just go, please.

739
01:04:23,084 --> 01:04:24,802
Go.

740
01:04:45,444 --> 01:04:48,880
- Why are you still here?
- I won't leave you here like this.

741
01:04:51,444 --> 01:04:55,278
Listen, I have a car. I'm having
a quick drink at a friend's house.

742
01:04:55,364 --> 01:04:58,595
Just take a ride with me.
You know? Catch your breath.

743
01:04:58,684 --> 01:05:00,675
I'll take you back to Tom.

744
01:05:07,484 --> 01:05:09,952
- Champagne?
- Sure.

745
01:05:21,004 --> 01:05:23,359
And that's the ball game!

746
01:05:25,444 --> 01:05:28,117
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, I love this song!

747
01:05:28,204 --> 01:05:32,083
No, wait, I really shouldn't...
I can't... No, listen.

748
01:05:33,204 --> 01:05:36,992
Bernardo Salviati can actually
trace his family back to Machiavelli.

749
01:05:48,364 --> 01:05:51,640
Wow. That's a big house.

750
01:05:51,724 --> 01:05:55,399
Nextron's thinking of buying it,
turn it into a resort complex.

751
01:06:09,124 --> 01:06:10,842
Peter, hello.

752
01:06:10,924 --> 01:06:14,394
Good to see you.
Bernardo, Sarah McNerney.

753
01:06:17,764 --> 01:06:20,995
Tell me, pretty one,
what brings you to Venice?

754
01:06:21,084 --> 01:06:23,040
I'm on my honeymoon.

755
01:06:23,124 --> 01:06:24,523
- Your honeymoon?
- Yeah.

756
01:06:24,604 --> 01:06:28,517
- She's so young to be married.
- Why does everyone keep on saying that?

757
01:06:29,124 --> 01:06:30,523
Where is your husband?

758
01:06:30,604 --> 01:06:35,962
I'm going to meet up with him,
you know, later.

759
01:06:38,604 --> 01:06:43,439
I was married for 27 years
before my wife passed away.

760
01:06:43,524 --> 01:06:47,836
Believe me, the first months
are the most difficult.

761
01:06:52,244 --> 01:06:54,838
Bernardo here's a little bit of a romantic.

762
01:06:57,204 --> 01:06:59,195
I love that.

763
01:06:59,924 --> 01:07:01,562
Let's have a drink.

764
01:07:02,284 --> 01:07:03,512
Please.

765
01:07:03,604 --> 01:07:07,199
You're on the radio? That's awesome!

766
01:07:08,724 --> 01:07:14,515
So, when are we gonna go back to do the...?

767
01:07:14,924 --> 01:07:17,961
Whoa, yeah. I can't do that.

768
01:07:18,044 --> 01:07:22,913
Don't tell me all the cute conversation
and air-humping is leading nowhere.

769
01:07:26,684 --> 01:07:31,633
You mean when are we gonna...?

770
01:07:34,084 --> 01:07:39,920
All right, so I'm gonna go and hit the...
and then we'll do that thing.

771
01:07:40,004 --> 01:07:42,472
- Cool.
- OK.

772
01:07:42,564 --> 01:07:44,555
I'll be waiting!

773
01:08:02,884 --> 01:08:05,523
And the hits just keep on comin'.

774
01:08:17,004 --> 01:08:19,677
Can I get the key to 309, please?

775
01:08:19,764 --> 01:08:22,642
And do you know
if my wife's up in the room?

776
01:08:22,724 --> 01:08:25,761
A good husband knows
where his wife is at all time.

777
01:08:27,204 --> 01:08:31,197
And a good maitre d'
answers questions when he's asked.

778
01:08:37,164 --> 01:08:39,473
Look, I'm not gonna pay you for an answer.

779
01:08:40,484 --> 01:08:42,793
In this case, you should.

780
01:08:52,484 --> 01:08:56,796
Your wife is in a car on her way
to Salviati's, with Mr Prentiss.

781
01:08:57,484 --> 01:08:59,475
Mr Peter Prentiss?

782
01:09:02,364 --> 01:09:05,242
Of course. What's Salviati's?

783
01:09:05,324 --> 01:09:08,555
One of the oldest
and most beautiful estates in Venice.

784
01:09:08,644 --> 01:09:12,717
- Maybe Mr Peter will buy it.
- Of course Mr Peter will buy it.

785
01:09:12,804 --> 01:09:15,364
All right, where is this place?

786
01:09:19,924 --> 01:09:22,722
You can't go. You will be shot on sight.

787
01:09:22,804 --> 01:09:24,954
OK. That's...

788
01:09:27,844 --> 01:09:32,235
- When are they coming back?
- They are out for the evening.

789
01:09:32,324 --> 01:09:34,201
You know what?

790
01:09:34,284 --> 01:09:39,312
I'm not gonna be waiting here
for her when she gets back.

791
01:09:39,404 --> 01:09:41,122
Oh, no!

792
01:09:49,804 --> 01:09:52,238
I wanna say that word!

793
01:09:56,804 --> 01:10:00,558
Sarah,
maybe we should switch to water, huh?

794
01:10:04,644 --> 01:10:06,874
I think we should go find Tom now.

795
01:10:13,044 --> 01:10:15,956
That was the longest freakin' piss
in Italian history.

796
01:10:16,044 --> 01:10:17,796
Hey, Wendy.

797
01:10:19,004 --> 01:10:21,802
I couldn't find you in the crowd.

798
01:10:23,724 --> 01:10:26,113
That's cool. You ready to go?

799
01:10:27,684 --> 01:10:30,198
Yeah. Listen...

800
01:10:30,284 --> 01:10:34,482
Why don't I just walk you back
to your hotel and drop you off?

801
01:10:34,564 --> 01:10:36,555
That sounds like a plan.

802
01:10:36,644 --> 01:10:39,204
OK. What hotel are you staying at?

803
01:10:39,284 --> 01:10:41,275
What hotel are you staying at?

804
01:10:42,404 --> 01:10:44,395
The Gianna.

805
01:10:44,484 --> 01:10:46,679
Oh, my God! Me too!

806
01:11:04,684 --> 01:11:08,313
<i>Oh, my God. This is like a Twilight Zone.</i>

807
01:11:08,404 --> 01:11:10,395
I couldn't agree with you more.

808
01:11:22,604 --> 01:11:24,879
We're here.

809
01:11:26,684 --> 01:11:30,199
Damn, I don't have my key.
Can I use your phone?

810
01:11:30,284 --> 01:11:31,922
My phone?

811
01:11:32,004 --> 01:11:34,723
Yeah, to call downstairs. For my key.

812
01:11:44,684 --> 01:11:48,313
Oh, slow down there.
I think you got the wrong room.

813
01:11:52,604 --> 01:11:54,117
Oh, my!

814
01:11:55,964 --> 01:11:56,953
Oh, God.

815
01:11:57,044 --> 01:11:59,797
Insult me, radio man!

816
01:12:01,564 --> 01:12:03,794
I'm on my honeymoon.

817
01:12:09,964 --> 01:12:11,955
- I'm telling you...
- You pig!

818
01:12:32,324 --> 01:12:34,042
Thank you.

819
01:12:40,924 --> 01:12:43,119
What? What?

820
01:12:43,204 --> 01:12:45,001
- What?
- I can't take this any more.

821
01:12:48,644 --> 01:12:50,635
I'm on my honeymoon!

822
01:12:54,244 --> 01:12:57,600
Calm down. You were just doing
the same thing with Wendy.

823
01:12:57,684 --> 01:12:59,879
You have no right to be angry.

824
01:12:59,964 --> 01:13:02,432
- You slut!
- Excuse me?

825
01:13:02,524 --> 01:13:05,880
You had your tongue down his throat.
I saw it out the window!

826
01:13:06,564 --> 01:13:08,236
Did you see me slap him, then?

827
01:13:08,324 --> 01:13:10,360
Don't give me that.

828
01:13:10,444 --> 01:13:13,675
Some part of you wants him! Just say it!

829
01:13:13,764 --> 01:13:18,076
Fine. I'm not gonna lie any more.

830
01:13:18,164 --> 01:13:21,156
Certain things would be easier,
given his background.

831
01:13:21,244 --> 01:13:25,522
And a small part of me thought that
I wanted that once. A very small part.

832
01:13:29,404 --> 01:13:32,840
Why would you invite him
on our honeymoon?

833
01:13:32,924 --> 01:13:36,633
I didn't invite him.
I don't know how he found us.

834
01:13:36,724 --> 01:13:39,238
Oh, yeah? Well, maybe it was magic.

835
01:13:39,324 --> 01:13:42,396
No, Peter must be a warlock.

836
01:13:46,964 --> 01:13:48,363
That's yours.

837
01:13:48,444 --> 01:13:52,483
Yeah, sure. It matches perfect
with my red leather panties!

838
01:13:54,284 --> 01:13:58,436
OK, I met a woman at a bar.
Nothing happened.

839
01:13:58,524 --> 01:14:02,756
You picked up a total stranger at a bar,
brought her back to our honeymoon suite,

840
01:14:02,844 --> 01:14:04,835
and took off her disgusting red bra?

841
01:14:04,924 --> 01:14:06,516
Nothing happened, I swear.

842
01:14:06,604 --> 01:14:10,119
No, the brajustjumped off
her bare naked breasts.

843
01:14:11,524 --> 01:14:16,552
You sit there and make me feel guilty
for a kiss, a kiss that I didn't even want!

844
01:14:16,644 --> 01:14:19,238
Don't tell me you didn't want it!

845
01:14:20,044 --> 01:14:24,162
You wanted it! I could see from
the balcony that you wanted it!

846
01:14:26,364 --> 01:14:28,514
I'm sorry. Oh, my God.

847
01:14:28,604 --> 01:14:30,640
Son of a biatch!

848
01:14:30,724 --> 01:14:33,318
- My skull is on fire!
- Oh, oh, oh, OK...

849
01:14:34,604 --> 01:14:36,674
- Who is it?
- Room service.

850
01:14:37,084 --> 01:14:39,279
Just... You just...

851
01:14:42,964 --> 01:14:44,955
- No, go away!
- Listen, I'm leaving.

852
01:14:45,044 --> 01:14:47,558
Last chance. Come with me to Seattle.

853
01:14:47,644 --> 01:14:50,920
Hello, Peter. So glad you could join us.

854
01:14:52,044 --> 01:14:55,036
Welcome to the honeymoon from hell,
shitheel!

855
01:14:55,124 --> 01:14:56,398
What are you doing, Tom?

856
01:14:56,484 --> 01:14:59,999
I think it's time for Peter and I to tangle.

857
01:15:00,084 --> 01:15:03,360
- See? You have no future with this lunatic!
- Shut up!

858
01:15:03,444 --> 01:15:05,036
Tom, you're acting crazy!

859
01:15:05,124 --> 01:15:09,834
Maybe it's cos I just got hit in the head
with a ten-pound ashtray!

860
01:15:10,364 --> 01:15:15,040
I gotta warn you, Leezak. I studied
karate with a Chinese grandmaster.

861
01:15:15,124 --> 01:15:19,595
Yeah? Well, I hope he showed you
how to pull a fire poker out of your ass!

862
01:15:19,684 --> 01:15:21,675
Tom, put the poker down.

863
01:15:25,404 --> 01:15:28,157
Fredo, call the police!

864
01:15:29,324 --> 01:15:31,440
Move, move, move!

865
01:15:37,244 --> 01:15:39,997
You sat at our wedding!

866
01:15:40,084 --> 01:15:42,723
You heard us take our vows.

867
01:15:42,804 --> 01:15:47,924
And you still had the nerve
to show up on our honeymoon

868
01:15:48,004 --> 01:15:50,564
and try to have sex with my wife!

869
01:15:56,444 --> 01:15:57,638
Run, you coward!

870
01:15:57,724 --> 01:15:59,715
You stay away from my wife!

871
01:16:02,244 --> 01:16:03,723
I didn't...

872
01:16:03,804 --> 01:16:06,034
Please, stop! That's my husband!

873
01:16:16,724 --> 01:16:19,033
- Maybe they were right.
- Who?

874
01:16:21,484 --> 01:16:25,875
Everyone. They said that
we were too young,

875
01:16:26,644 --> 01:16:29,841
and that we needed to get
to know each other better.

876
01:16:32,244 --> 01:16:34,314
Maybe they were right.

877
01:16:35,484 --> 01:16:37,202
Maybe love isn't enough.

878
01:16:44,044 --> 01:16:45,113
What did he say?

879
01:16:45,204 --> 01:16:47,354
Peterjust bailed us out.

880
01:16:49,244 --> 01:16:51,519
Well, that's justjim-dandy.

881
01:16:53,084 --> 01:16:54,961
Forget it.

882
01:16:55,044 --> 01:16:57,114
- I'm going home.
- Yeah, me too!

883
01:17:00,484 --> 01:17:02,759
Passports, please.

884
01:17:02,844 --> 01:17:07,156
Are you leaving with any fruit,
vegetables or currency in excess of $10,000?

885
01:17:07,244 --> 01:17:12,193
No. No, but my husband does have
two pounds of hash hidden in his rectum.

886
01:17:23,324 --> 01:17:29,115
The first sex I had on my honeymoon
was with a man named Santino.

887
01:17:30,284 --> 01:17:32,115
And you're laughing?

888
01:17:33,604 --> 01:17:36,641
Excuse me, stewardess. Can I...?

889
01:17:39,404 --> 01:17:44,558
Can I get one of those doughnut pillows?

890
01:17:45,164 --> 01:17:47,155
Yeah, right away.

891
01:17:49,684 --> 01:17:52,118
Sweet girl.

892
01:17:54,724 --> 01:17:56,874
Excuse me. Sorry.

893
01:18:11,964 --> 01:18:14,558
I feel like we've been married for 50 years.

894
01:18:14,644 --> 01:18:16,680
Oh, you should be so lucky.

895
01:18:19,564 --> 01:18:24,319
- Tell me how Peter ended up in our hotel.
- Tell me what happened with Red Bra.

896
01:18:25,204 --> 01:18:27,843
What? What? What are you looking at?

897
01:18:27,924 --> 01:18:31,758
- I hope you used a rubber.
- No, I didn't! It didn't get that far.

898
01:18:31,844 --> 01:18:34,483
- I hope Peter used one.
- They don't sell condoms that big.

899
01:18:36,924 --> 01:18:40,155
That's funny. You hear that?
We got a comedian on the plane.

900
01:18:40,244 --> 01:18:42,633
- You want me to make you laugh?
- Yeah.

901
01:18:42,724 --> 01:18:45,284
I'm moving out when I get home.
How funny is that?

902
01:18:45,364 --> 01:18:47,719
- Great!
- The second we get home.

903
01:18:47,804 --> 01:18:49,556
- I'm done talking now.
- Me too.

904
01:18:52,124 --> 01:18:54,797
And that was it. Game over.

905
01:19:06,724 --> 01:19:08,999
- What's up?
- She came to the apartment.

906
01:19:09,084 --> 01:19:11,040
- Is she there now?
- No, she left.

907
01:19:11,724 --> 01:19:14,397
- Did she say anything?
- She took all her stuff.

908
01:19:15,164 --> 01:19:17,155
That can't be good.

909
01:19:18,404 --> 01:19:20,599
And she left you this.

910
01:19:20,964 --> 01:19:22,477
What's that?

911
01:19:27,084 --> 01:19:28,483
Beer?

912
01:19:29,164 --> 01:19:35,080
Come on, man. You're getting divorced.
Breakfast beer is a must.

913
01:19:37,044 --> 01:19:40,036
- I need to talk to my dad. Give me a lift?
- Sure.

914
01:19:43,884 --> 01:19:46,876
Gonna tell me what you're chewing on?

915
01:19:48,924 --> 01:19:51,313
I just don't know if love is enough any more.

916
01:19:51,404 --> 01:19:54,157
What do you mean, "enough"?

917
01:19:54,244 --> 01:19:58,920
I mean, even if Sarah and I do love each other,

918
01:20:00,124 --> 01:20:03,321
maybe we did need more time
to get to know each other.

919
01:20:06,564 --> 01:20:11,513
So, what you're saying here is

920
01:20:11,604 --> 01:20:16,155
you had a couple of bad days in Europe,
and it's over.

921
01:20:18,244 --> 01:20:20,280
Time to grow up, Tommy.

922
01:20:21,924 --> 01:20:26,395
Some days your mother and me loved each
other. Other days we had to work at it.

923
01:20:27,404 --> 01:20:30,282
You never see the hard days
in a photo album.

924
01:20:30,964 --> 01:20:35,435
But those are the ones that get you
from one happy snapshot to the next.

925
01:20:37,324 --> 01:20:42,956
I'm sorry your honeymoon stunk, but that's
what you got dealt. Now work through it.

926
01:20:44,404 --> 01:20:49,034
Sarah doesn't need a guy with
a fat wallet to make her happy.

927
01:20:49,124 --> 01:20:54,198
I saw how you love this girl.
How you two lit each other up.

928
01:20:56,204 --> 01:20:59,037
She doesn't need any more security than that.

929
01:21:03,964 --> 01:21:05,238
Thanks, Dad.

930
01:21:06,564 --> 01:21:08,555
Is it over?

931
01:21:10,324 --> 01:21:12,235
Not even close.

932
01:21:18,524 --> 01:21:21,755
What you do here, Tom Leezak?
You no allowed here no more.

933
01:21:21,844 --> 01:21:23,562
Open the gates, jack-in-the-box.

934
01:21:23,644 --> 01:21:27,239
Me no jack-in-box! You jack-in-box!
Go away now!

935
01:21:27,324 --> 01:21:29,884
Don't make me break my foot off in your ass.

936
01:21:29,964 --> 01:21:32,398
Look, Yuan, I just need to talk to her.

937
01:21:32,484 --> 01:21:35,362
Relationship over. She no like you any more.

938
01:21:35,444 --> 01:21:38,242
- Open the goddamn gate!
- Shut up, Kyle!

939
01:21:38,324 --> 01:21:41,316
Look, Yuan, did she actually
say those words to you?

940
01:21:41,404 --> 01:21:44,680
<i>She say you have kiki with bimbo.
Same thing.</i>

941
01:21:45,924 --> 01:21:48,233
We are not leaving this intercom.

942
01:21:48,324 --> 01:21:52,556
Until Sarah herself confirms
that she is shitcanning Tom!

943
01:21:53,764 --> 01:21:54,799
We're not.

944
01:21:54,884 --> 01:22:00,163
All right, that is damn straight!
This is my wife! Now open up the gate!

945
01:22:00,244 --> 01:22:02,439
Can't we give the guy a chance to explain?

946
01:22:02,524 --> 01:22:04,480
Don't even think about it, Dickie.

947
01:22:05,044 --> 01:22:08,559
Either you're gonna open the gate,
or I'm gonna open the gate.

948
01:22:08,644 --> 01:22:10,123
Either way, I'm coming in!

949
01:22:11,004 --> 01:22:15,520
- We'll sic the hounds on you, Leezak!
- Bring 'em on, Willie!

950
01:22:27,564 --> 01:22:28,553
What's going on?

951
01:22:28,644 --> 01:22:32,000
You leave me no choice!
I'm gonna have to ram the gate!

952
01:22:32,084 --> 01:22:34,154
I am so down with that!

953
01:22:36,764 --> 01:22:38,561
- What we do now?
- Call the cops.

954
01:22:40,164 --> 01:22:42,155
We call SWAT team on your ass!

955
01:22:42,564 --> 01:22:48,355
I'm ramming the gate! I don't know if you're
hearing, but I am going to ram your gate!

956
01:22:49,444 --> 01:22:53,119
- What is the commotion in here?
- Tom ram gate.

957
01:22:59,764 --> 01:23:01,436
What the hell is this?

958
01:23:01,844 --> 01:23:04,039
It's go time.

959
01:23:21,044 --> 01:23:22,716
That is one strong gate.

960
01:23:26,644 --> 01:23:27,633
Tom?

961
01:23:41,844 --> 01:23:47,476
Look, Yuan, Willie,
whoever else is listening...

962
01:23:47,564 --> 01:23:52,240
You don't want me to be with Sarah,
and I can't change that.

963
01:23:52,324 --> 01:23:58,035
I don't know where we're gonna be
in ten, 20, 40 years.

964
01:23:58,124 --> 01:24:00,035
I don't know who we're gonna be.

965
01:24:00,124 --> 01:24:03,958
I don't know if I'm ever gonna
be able to give her all of this.

966
01:24:05,044 --> 01:24:09,003
There are a million things that I don't know.

967
01:24:09,604 --> 01:24:12,323
But there's one thing that I do.

968
01:24:12,404 --> 01:24:15,282
And that's that I love Sarah.

969
01:24:15,364 --> 01:24:19,721
And I am going to love her
day in and day out

970
01:24:19,804 --> 01:24:21,999
for the rest of my life.

971
01:24:24,004 --> 01:24:26,199
Now, will you please,

972
01:24:27,244 --> 01:24:29,235
please,

973
01:24:30,564 --> 01:24:34,477
open the gate so I can tell that to my wife.

974
01:24:58,004 --> 01:25:00,393
I'm sorry, man.

975
01:25:01,084 --> 01:25:05,475
Sometimes when it's over, it's just over.

976
01:25:26,284 --> 01:25:29,833
Drop the love bomb, baby! Yeah!

977
01:25:35,484 --> 01:25:37,202
Now do you get it?

978
01:25:39,684 --> 01:25:41,834
I love him, Daddy.

979
01:25:43,124 --> 01:25:45,160
Then go get him.

980
01:26:19,564 --> 01:26:21,714
- I'm sorry.
- Me too.

981
01:26:23,364 --> 01:26:25,798
I miss you.

982
01:26:25,884 --> 01:26:28,273
I miss you, too.

983
01:26:28,884 --> 01:26:32,115
I miss wrecking airplane bathrooms
with you.

984
01:26:32,204 --> 01:26:34,672
I miss sleeping with you inside a snowball.

985
01:26:36,524 --> 01:26:39,482
And torching hotels in Europe.

986
01:26:41,364 --> 01:26:45,277
I miss doing time in prison with you.

987
01:26:55,324 --> 01:26:58,122
- Do you wanna try to...?
- Definitely.

988
01:26:59,122 --> 01:27:09,122
