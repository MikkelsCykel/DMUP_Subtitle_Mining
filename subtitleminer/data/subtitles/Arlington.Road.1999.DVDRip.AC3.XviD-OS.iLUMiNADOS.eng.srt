<i>Come on.</i>

2
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:50,949
<i>Do it, chicken.</i>

3
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,485

00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:02,558
<i>Go on. Do it.</i>

00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:05,393
<i>Go on. Hurry up.</i>

6
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:15,566
<i>Are you chicken, or what?</i>

7
00:01:27,353 --> 00:01:28,877
<i>Look out!</i>

8
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:05,450
Kid?

9
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:06,958
Hey, kid.

10
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:22,637
What happened?

11
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:29,479
Help! Somebody help!

12
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:48,459
Hold on, now.
You're gonna be all right.

13
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:52,537
Almost there.
Come on!

14
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:59,277
- Hello, is this the emergency room?
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

15
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,939
- I'm bringing a child in.
- <i>What is your emergency?</i>

16
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,483
I don't know!
I'm bringing a child in!

17
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:06,951
<i>Can you tell me the nature</i>
<i>of your emergency?</i>

18
00:03:07,887 --> 00:03:09,821
Help!

19
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,323
Help him!

20
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,992
- Let's get a cold package, stat!
- Let me have the boy!

21
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:21,223
To the burn unit!
It's okay now, sir.

22
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:24,737
Put him in ER 8.
Sir, you have to stay with me now.

23
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:28,830
- Are you the boy's father?
- No.

24
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:32,272
He was just...

25
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:35,644
He was walking down
the middle of the road.

26
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,979
Have you seen him before?
What's his name?

27
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:43,019
- Sir, please. It's important.
- What? What?

28
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:47,253
- The boy's name!
- I don't know his name!

29
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:05,487
Excuse me, Mr. Faraday?

30
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:06,896
Yeah?

31
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:08,900
We're Brady's parents.

32
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:14,764
You feel like they're old enough.

33
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:17,605
- They should be able to...
- Can't let them out of your sight.

34
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:20,407
I mean, he said he was going
to the park to play.

35
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,244
He didn't want us to know
what he was doing.

36
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:28,719
Michael, we can't thank you enough.
If you hadn't come along when you did...

37
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:31,086
No, I'm just glad we made it.

38
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,858
So, <i>uh....</i>

39
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:38,396
what, uh...

40
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:41,900
He and his friends got together
all their fireworks...

41
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:46,064
their cones and their candles...
and they tied them up together.

42
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:49,267
They were trying to blast
some kind of super rocket in the park.

43
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:51,469
And Brady's the one who...

44
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:54,206
He must've been the one
that set it off.

45
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,874
The other kids must've
put him up to it.

46
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:03,617
And it was just starting
to feel like home too.

47
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:06,157
I thought that to myself today.

48
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:09,592
Just thought it's starting
to feel like home.

49
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:16,298
He's gonna be okay.

50
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:20,366
He's gonna be all right.

51
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:24,467
Thank you, Michael.

52
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:28,580
<i>Unit 14, clear.</i>

53
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:31,573
<i>Oh, God.</i>

54
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:35,348
It's gotta <i>be</i> hell
they're going through.

55
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:39,949
Two months they've lived there.
I haven't said one word to 'em.

56
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:44,324
Well, you can't be
best friends with everybody.

57
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:48,561
I watch them fixin' up their house,
their kids playin' in their yard.

58
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:52,730
I held their son in my arms
hangin' on for his life tonight.

59
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:55,296
Kid lives right across the street.

60
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:57,501
I didn't even know his name.

61
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,992
Did he die?

62
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:26,164
No, he's gonna <i>be</i> in the hospital
for a while, but he'll be fine.

63
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:30,506
I saw the blood in the street.

64
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,779
He's gonna be okay, Grant.

65
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:41,183
Brooke said that she made you
some dinner. You're not hungry?

66
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,824
Want me to fix you something?

67
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:54,665
Grant?

68
00:08:57,303 --> 00:09:02,172
- She gonna stay here every night?
- No, not every night.

69
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:07,370
She stayed last night
because I asked her.

70
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:10,506
We talked about Brooke.
You said you liked her.

71
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:13,211
I liked her better before.

72
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:16,554
Yeah, well...

73
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:22,151
try to get some sleep, okay?

74
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:32,997
Love you.

75
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:54,553
<i>The name of this course</i>
<i>is American Terrorism.</i>

76
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:58,862
Two hundred years ago, we fought
a revolution over certain beliefs...

77
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:04,233
liberty, justice for all,
self-rule and self- reliance.

78
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:08,034
There are many in this country
who feel we have not yet won that war.

79
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:11,806
Terrorist acts,
violent political theater...

80
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:15,142
These have been a part of social dissent
in this country since its inception.

81
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:19,048
But why?
Why here in this land of freedom?

82
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:22,144
What's led men to such bloodshed...

83
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:24,382
in the name of their beliefs?

84
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,982
Why in this era
of national prosperity...

85
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:30,460
has the antigovernment movement
been at its peak?

86
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:34,465
And what's that gonna mean
when the prosperity fades?

87
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:37,161
Fewer and fewer of us are voting.

88
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:39,227
More and more of us are joining
the ranks of a resistance.

89
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:43,105
How long are we gonna call
these numbers insignificant?

90
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:47,908
What do they have to teach us?

91
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:09,633
- I'm going to go explore.
- Okay.

92
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:24,141
The only woman I ever liked havin'
around that was smarter than me.

93
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:26,548
Whit Carver, generous to a fault.

94
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:34,987
Good day, Mr. Faraday.

95
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:37,689
- How's he doin'?
- He's all right.

96
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:40,391
We're still seeing his counselor.

97
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:43,060
She says he's improving,
but he still keeps to himself a lot.

98
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:46,838
How's his dad doin'?

99
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,140
He's all right.

100
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,575
Still seeing his graduate student?

101
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:56,879
Yeah. She says
he's improving, but...

102
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:59,918
He still keeps to himself
a lot, huh?

103
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:04,651
This kid they got me
partnered with...

104
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:09,684
is a walking, laptop computer,
cyberspace geek.

105
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:13,027
Put him across from some real bad guys,
it's like he's surprised to see 'em.

106
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:16,500
- I ought to make him take your course.
- Really?

107
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,799
- Teachin' it again?
- Oh, yeah.

108
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:23,100
She'd like that.
I know what that would mean to her.

109
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:27,111
The invitation's still good
for you to come by as a guest.

110
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:32,840
I'd rather not stand trial
in front of you.

111
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:37,753
- That's not what it would be.
- Yeah, right. I know what it would be.

112
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,025
How's work?

113
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:45,892
You know, we're a team.

114
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:52,262
That's what I miss, you know?

115
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:55,466
Conversations about work.
I'd tell her all about my day.

116
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,975
She couldn't tell me
a goddamn thing.

117
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:02,246
You wouldn't think I'd miss that,
but I do.

118
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:05,750
Have me over to dinner sometime.
I'll keep some state secrets from you.

119
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:08,946
- It'll be like she never left.
- People remember her, Whit?

120
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,220
- What do you mean?
- At the Bureau.

121
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:16,625
Do they remember,
or do people forget?

122
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,966
They remember her, Michael.
They do.

123
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,908
Leah died for her country.

124
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:35,346
She shouldn't have.

125
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:47,587
<i>Michael, hello! How are you doing?</i>
<i>Our other guest of honor. Come in.</i>

126
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,220
- Hope we're not late.
- No. Oliver, Michael's here.

127
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:52,457
- Cheryl, this is Brooke.
- Hi, it's nice to meet you.

128
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:54,897
It's really nice to meet you too.

129
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:58,630
And this must be Grant.
How are you doing?

130
00:13:58,704 --> 00:14:03,164
There's junk food in the kitchen that's
just for kids and not for grownups.

131
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:07,110
- Come on in.
- Let me introduce you to some friends.

132
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:11,916
- Hot dog, please.
- Brady's looking great.

133
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:15,351
Yeah, so would you if you found a way
to get out of school for a while.

134
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:20,017
You're right, I would.
I teach at G. W... American history.

135
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:23,952
I was always bad in history.

136
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:27,396
- Condemned to repeat it?
- Yeah, several times.

137
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:31,893
So, what kind of work do you do?

138
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:36,169
I'm a structural engineer.
You know the Reston Mall?

139
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:39,939
- Oh, yeah.
- We're redesigning the addition.

140
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:43,812
You want bigger storage, more parking?
I'm the guy to ask.

141
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:47,080
<i>He knows. I'm not sure he totally</i>
<i>understands what happened.</i>

142
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:49,552
<i>You know Michael from...</i>

143
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:53,649
I was Michael's teaching assistant
in my first year of grad school.

144
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,058
There was nothing between us.

145
00:14:56,128 --> 00:14:59,393
I knew his family.
I knew Leah.

146
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:02,599
I mean, this thing,
this is kind of...

147
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:06,696
kind of new between us.

148
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:07,830
Wow.

149
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:13,043
You're so sweet together.

150
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:15,478
Of course,
I think the world of him.

151
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:19,347
He's such a good man.

152
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,352
Such a good father.

153
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:33,091
The job was just
too appealing to pass up.

154
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:35,759
Contracts were down
all over St. Louis.

155
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:39,827
- How long were you in St. Louis?
- Four years, thereabouts.

156
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:43,432
I grew up on a farm
in a place called Carson, Kansas.

157
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,944
Never lived East before.

158
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:49,173
Kids'll get to see
their first ocean.

159
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:52,012
Yeah, I'm afraid
downtown's falling apart.

160
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:56,384
That's what I hear. I guess we're
not in Kansas anymore, eh, Toto?

161
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,547
Hannah.

162
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,057
Bedtime.

163
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,922
- Be careful of his hand!
- I haven't even got two hands!

164
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,704
It's been a long time since
I've seen him just bein' a kid.

165
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:15,569
Sometimes he's...

166
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:18,075
You know, since his mother...

167
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,346
He has a tough time
making friends sometimes.

168
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,877
Well...

169
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:30,649
lucky we all need friends.

170
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:33,021
Life just isn't the same
without 'em.

171
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,731
Let me take this in. Dad?

172
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:52,504
- Yeah?
- How do you spell "restricted"?

173
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:56,780
Restricted. R-E-S-T-R-l...

174
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:01,178
You know how to use the dictionary.
What are you guys doin' in there?

175
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:03,278
Building a compound.

176
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,915
- Compound?
- Soldiers' compound.

177
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,625
Stop, Dad.

178
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,289
You have to know
the secret handshake.

179
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,298
Should we tell him?

180
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:18,937
All right. Well...

181
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:23,168
just so I know you're not gonna
use any fireworks in there, Brady.

182
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:25,176
General Brady, Dad.

183
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:28,680
Yeah?
No fireworks, General Brady.

184
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:32,706
That's classified information.
You don't know the secret handshake.

185
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:35,845
- I'm serious, Brady.
- Come on, Grant.

186
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:40,050
Get washed up, guys.
We're gonna get dinner on.

187
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:59,271
- Come on in.
- Got something for you in my mailbox.

188
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:00,777
What's that?

189
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,010
"University of Pennsylvania"?

190
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,643
- I thought you hadn't lived East before.
- I haven't.

191
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:10,677
I went to Kansas State, class of '78.
Must have me mixed up with someone else.

192
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:14,624
- Same class, huh?
- Yeah, but at K State.

193
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:16,991
It's a reunion.

194
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:19,929
Must've lost track of some guy,
sent it to me instead.

195
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:23,126
Sorry about the mess. Cheryl and the
girls are at a church group tonight.

196
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:25,227
I'm trying to catch up
on a little work.

197
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:27,363
- How are ya?
- Good.

198
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,532
- How's Grant?
- He's doin' great.

199
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,039
Excuse me a minute. Hello?

200
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:41,584
Why don't I call you back?

201
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:45,289
What do you mean?

202
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:47,858
Okay.

203
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:53,322
Well, we should really talk
in person about this.

204
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:54,831
Yeah.

205
00:18:57,936 --> 00:18:59,961
I could work on this tonight.

206
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:01,869
Okay. All right.

207
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,908
Listen, hold on a second.

208
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:08,003
This project is taking forever.
Client can't seem to make up his mind.

209
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,174
- This the Reston Mall?
- Yeah. We're getting it on track.

210
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,343
I'm sorry, I have to...

211
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:16,251
- We'll see each other this weekend.
- Yes, the Junior Ds.

212
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:20,052
- Brady keeps talking about it.
- Yeah, he's gonna love it.

213
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,525
He's gonna make more friends
than he'll know what to do with.

214
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:25,358
They do camp outs, trips.

215
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:28,593
Give you the house to yourself...

216
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,601
every now and then.

217
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,762
You and Brooke, I mean.

218
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:36,134
- I thank you, neighbor.
- For what?

219
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:38,301
For having
a ten-year-old next door.

220
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:47,779
- What do you know about shopping malls?
- Huh?

221
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:52,415
Shopping malls. I was over at
the Langs', talking with Oliver.

222
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:57,428
He had this blueprint on his counter.
He said it was the Reston Mall.

223
00:19:57,496 --> 00:20:00,192
- That's what he's workin' on.
- Yeah, but it wasn't.

224
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:03,393
- What do you mean?
- I looked.

225
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:07,302
It was a building.
It wasn't a mall.

226
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:10,136
- Right, it's an addition.
- No.

227
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,644
It was an office building.
It wasn't stores at all.

228
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:17,239
Oh, so, it's some other project
that he's working on.

229
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:24,415
Why would he tell me
it was a mall if it wasn't?

230
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:26,423
Why would he lie?

231
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:31,720
When you took engineering in college,
what kind of grades did you get?

232
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:33,731
I didn't take engineering.

233
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:43,770
What I saw was an office building.

234
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:50,575
Fourteen moths <i>ago</i>
on a Monday in January...

235
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:55,210
over 60 federal employees
went to work like they always <i>did....</i>

236
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:58,415
at the Roosevelt Federal Building
in downtown St. Louis.

237
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:03,218
Except on that Monday
they didn't come home.

238
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:05,786
In a truck parked in front...

239
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:10,597
was hidden 50 pounds
of C-4 plastic explosive.

240
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:14,469
When it was detonated, it disintegrated
the street side of the building...

241
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:18,134
obliterating dozens
of government offices...

242
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:20,735
the building's day care <i>center....</i>

243
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:24,912
and the St. Louis branch
of the Internal Revenue Service...

244
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:28,384
which was ultimately determined
to be the target of the attack.

245
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:33,152
The truck was leased by
this 33-year-old electrician...

246
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:36,083
Dean Scobee.

247
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:40,923
Scobee had served some prison time
for tax evasion...

248
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:45,060
and surveillance videos showed
that he was inside the vehicle...

249
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,469
leaving him among the 63 dead.

250
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:50,099
Does anyone not remember this?

251
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:53,902
You all remember the results
of the investigation?

252
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:57,779
- They said Scobee acted alone.
- One man, no conspirators.

253
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:00,647
Right?

254
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:05,549
He cheated the IRS. They caught
him at it, so he blew 'em up.

255
00:22:08,226 --> 00:22:12,458
This is a guy who people
described as average.

256
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:13,964
Friendly.

257
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:18,531
He'd been in the army,
but as a radio man.

258
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:21,299
He had very little experience
with munitions.

259
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:25,503
His parents considered him
a moderate conservative.

260
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:31,311
Two weeks prior to this, he received
a pay raise at his electrician's job.

261
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:35,319
Does that sound like a man who's
on the edge or a man who needed a push?

262
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:37,184
Huh?

263
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:39,621
Come on. I don't know.
I'm just asking.

264
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:43,627
Come on, Professor.
The Feds did this huge investigation.

265
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,993
That's right,
an investigation, I forgot.

266
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:48,191
Well...

267
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:51,201
the investigation
didn't satisfy me.

268
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:55,799
Miss O'Neill,
when you first heard the news...

269
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:59,833
terrorist attack in your own country...
how did that make you feel?

270
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:01,503
- Come on.
- Well...

271
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:05,607
What did you feel?

272
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:07,117
Angry.

273
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:10,245
Scared and stressed.

274
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:12,882
- Did you feel safe?
- No.

275
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:18,328
And then the next day,
when they found Scobee dead...

276
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,592
did you feel some relief?

277
00:23:20,665 --> 00:23:22,599
Did safety return?

278
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:38,009
The people in that building,
they felt safe...

279
00:23:39,651 --> 00:23:44,384
secure, just like you feel now.

280
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:49,623
And then an instant later...

281
00:23:51,563 --> 00:23:53,497
In an instant...

282
00:23:56,668 --> 00:23:59,603
they were gone forever.

283
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:10,172
We needed to have
this man to blame.

284
00:24:14,152 --> 00:24:16,382
We don't want others.

285
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,650
We want one name...

286
00:24:18,723 --> 00:24:20,816
and we want it fast...

287
00:24:20,892 --> 00:24:24,658
because it gives us
our security back.

288
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:30,362
We can say,
"Here was the one man...

289
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:32,528
unlike the rest of us.

290
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:37,468
We named him,
and he's no more.

291
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:40,170
And his reasons,
they're gone too."

292
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:43,271
But the truth is,
we don't know his reasons.

293
00:24:43,348 --> 00:24:46,112
We don't know why Scobee did it,
why it came to this.

294
00:24:46,184 --> 00:24:49,119
We can pretend we do...
the ten grand in taxes...

295
00:24:49,187 --> 00:24:51,121
but we don't <i>know....</i>

296
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:54,124
and we'll never know.

297
00:24:57,128 --> 00:25:01,030
And still, we feel safe...

298
00:25:04,736 --> 00:25:07,204
because we know his name.

299
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:11,701
As God is my witness...

300
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:14,438
I promise to give...

301
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:16,447
friendship to those in need.

302
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:20,608
Help to those in trouble.

303
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:25,118
I will work with faith and honor...

304
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:29,355
to uphold the Discoverer code.

305
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:34,395
To respect <i>myself....</i>

306
00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:37,201
my family...

307
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:39,203
and my country.

308
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:43,832
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome
Junior Discovery Troop 474.

309
00:25:59,424 --> 00:26:01,517
<i>This is Oliver's study...</i>

310
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:03,823
where he, you know,
gets away from the kids...

311
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,829
and me, I suppose.

312
00:26:07,432 --> 00:26:10,162
These are all projects
you've worked on?

313
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,567
I wish.
No, I collect sketches...

314
00:26:12,637 --> 00:26:15,197
blueprints,
designs of old buildings.

315
00:26:15,273 --> 00:26:17,503
This is a front view of Monticello.

316
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:20,010
- Down there is the Woolworth Building.
- It's his hobby.

317
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:23,070
- The St. Louis Arch.
- Yes, correct.

318
00:26:23,848 --> 00:26:26,840
So, then all of these drawings,
these buildings...

319
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:28,852
they're not just
for your job, then?

320
00:26:30,455 --> 00:26:32,582
Oh. So they're not
all shopping malls.

321
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:36,991
No, I don't know of any architecturally
significant shopping malls.

322
00:26:37,062 --> 00:26:40,031
Oh, honey, you just
haven't built them yet.

323
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:45,202
- Who's hungry?
- I'm famished.

324
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:49,639
Come on. I've got some
really delicious puff pastry.

325
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:54,470
They've got to work so hard
when they're there.

326
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:57,071
You've gotta keep 'em
in the seats.

327
00:26:57,148 --> 00:26:58,581
You know?

328
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:02,685
Politically, there's something
to be said for that.

329
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:05,052
Yeah, it was a lot of fun.
Here we are leaving the church.

330
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:07,182
Everyone thought we were
going to Mexico.

331
00:27:07,258 --> 00:27:09,226
- Where were you going?
- We were <i>going there....</i>

332
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:11,854
but the plane
never left the ground.

333
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,591
Some kind of engine trouble.

334
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:18,602
Couldn't leave till morning, so we spent
the night at the Wichita Airport Motel.

335
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:20,831
How romantic!

336
00:27:20,905 --> 00:27:24,466
- Well, for $19, it was wonderful.
- How long you two been married?

337
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:29,240
- Well, 12 years in August.
- What kind of example is that?

338
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:35,617
Well, I don't think we learn
responsibility from politicians.

339
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:37,780
We really learn it from family.

340
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:40,120
It's the people that we care about.

341
00:27:40,191 --> 00:27:43,820
- It's what they care about.
- He died when I was a teenager.

342
00:27:44,796 --> 00:27:46,593
Oh, I'm sorry.

343
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:48,098
Farm accident.

344
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:52,963
- Where would you say you get yours from?
- My what? My values?

345
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:01,039
- Probably from my wife.
- Values?

346
00:28:02,113 --> 00:28:04,138
What values?

347
00:28:04,215 --> 00:28:07,116
Michael and I were talking about
where you get your values <i>from....</i>

348
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:09,915
and we were both saying
it's mostly from family.

349
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:13,685
Well, where else you gonna get 'em?
Celebrities? Politicians?

350
00:28:13,758 --> 00:28:15,692
Not in this century.

351
00:28:17,962 --> 00:28:19,987
I just think it's...

352
00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:24,399
a sorry state of affairs when you can't
find a role model to cast your vote for.

353
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:26,903
It's not even role models,
necessarily.

354
00:28:26,971 --> 00:28:31,840
It's just people who acknowledge
the consequences of their actions.

355
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:36,779
Or pay for those actions. I think we
should put some politicians in jail.

356
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:41,376
You can't ask government
to be infallible.

357
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:44,081
You just can't.
But you can ask it to be accountable.

358
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:49,190
I can ask it to be honest.

359
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,922
You know, when Leah died...

360
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:55,193
all I wanted was someone...

361
00:28:55,266 --> 00:28:59,066
to tell me,
"W e made a mistake."

362
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:02,629
You know?
"We made a mistake.

363
00:29:02,707 --> 00:29:04,902
Your wife suffered for it...

364
00:29:05,977 --> 00:29:08,411
and we'd take it back
a hundred times if we could."

365
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:11,442
But, uh...

366
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:13,916
they don't say that.

367
00:29:13,985 --> 00:29:15,418
She would've.

368
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:24,290
Some of them knew her.

369
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:32,594
They work so hard at being able
to look you in the eye.

370
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:53,255
Excuse me.

371
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:09,198
Leave him alone.
He's fine.

372
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:14,844
Sorry.

373
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:25,820
- I see how much you miss her.
- There are just these times...

374
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:29,792
when you realize how much
your own life is out of your hands.

375
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:35,324
What are you gonna do?

376
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:41,363
I guess you can have faith.

377
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:47,542
Try to make a difference
while you can with Grant...

378
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:51,281
to your classes.

379
00:30:55,887 --> 00:30:57,821
What about you?

380
00:31:00,725 --> 00:31:02,659
Got my family...

381
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,891
and the buildings I leave behind.

382
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:13,537
That's it.

383
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:15,937
Get your shoulder up
a little bit, okay?

384
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:18,805
Step into it. Watch that ball
until it hits the bat.

385
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,811
That's it!

386
00:31:22,914 --> 00:31:25,007
You want some Crackerjack?

387
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:33,748
You sure? Popcorn and caramel.
It builds your muscles.

388
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:35,190
All right.

389
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:38,995
Hey, atta way, Faraday.

390
00:31:40,298 --> 00:31:44,496
- He's gettin' some confidence.
- He's a strong kid.

391
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:49,804
- He's been dealt some hard breaks.
- Atta way to swing.

392
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:55,071
- You give him strength.
- I'm tryin'.

393
00:31:55,146 --> 00:31:57,341
You do.

394
00:31:57,415 --> 00:32:00,213
Gettin' on with your life.
That's important for him to see.

395
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:05,118
He just wishes someone had to pay.

396
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:07,350
What?

397
00:32:08,726 --> 00:32:12,628
For his mother.
He wishes someone had to pay.

398
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:14,790
He's talked to you about her?

399
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,600
Our people send her in with
the wrong information then say...

400
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,604
"Hey, not my fault."

401
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:25,102
I can't live with that...

402
00:32:25,176 --> 00:32:28,373
for you,
let alone a nine-year-old boy.

403
00:32:29,814 --> 00:32:32,442
Grant talked to you
about his mother?

404
00:32:34,552 --> 00:32:36,144
Well, yeah.

405
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:39,621
I hope that's all right.
We talk about a lot of things.

406
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:43,284
He's a smart kid.

407
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:48,889
Way to go, Grant.

408
00:32:50,868 --> 00:32:53,462
We're never more wise
than when we're children.

409
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:55,472
They say it, and it's true.

410
00:32:57,241 --> 00:32:59,709
We'll never see things
that clear again.

411
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:07,576
Let me have a hit.

412
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:22,565
Come on, now, it's dinnertime.
Wash your hands.

413
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:25,864
- I'm eating with Brady.
- No, come on, now.

414
00:33:26,804 --> 00:33:29,466
Michael, I'm sorry.
Brady invited him over for dinner.

415
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:33,032
- I thought he'd asked you.
- Can I eat with Brady, Dad?

416
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:41,207
Okay, if his dad
says it's all right.

417
00:33:41,285 --> 00:33:43,378
Is it all right, kids?

418
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:49,282
I can fly!

419
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,072
- <i>Good afternoon, U Penn.</i>
- Transcript office, please.

420
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:13,540
- <i>Transcripts.</i>
- I'm calling from Washington University.

421
00:34:13,618 --> 00:34:17,452
We have a student who's applying for
graduate work in our history department.

422
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:20,821
I need to verify his
undergrad record with you guys.

423
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:24,987
He's been out of school
for some time.

424
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:28,765
The name's Oliver Lang.

425
00:34:29,934 --> 00:34:32,368
Are you telling me that you
took this out of his mailbox?

426
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:34,962
- That is illegal.
- Tell me if you think this is strange.

427
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:37,701
The University of Pennsylvania
keeps sending him alumni stuff...

428
00:34:37,775 --> 00:34:39,709
for a 20-year reunion.

429
00:34:39,777 --> 00:34:43,304
He says he went to Kansas State. They
have him mixed up with someone else.

430
00:34:43,381 --> 00:34:46,475
So I call Penn.
I get that guy's transcripts.

431
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:50,146
- What? Why? Michael! Oh, my God!
- Listen to me.

432
00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:53,588
That guy has a completely
different physical description.

433
00:34:53,658 --> 00:34:55,990
- He never took a class in engineering.
- Right...

434
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:58,255
because they've got him mixed up
with somebody else.

435
00:34:58,329 --> 00:35:01,821
This U Penn Oliver
is the same age as Oliver.

436
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:05,062
- Wait. As our Oliver?
- As our Oliver, yes.

437
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:08,105
He graduated the same year, and...

438
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:12,165
he comes from Carson, Kansas,
Oliver's hometown.

439
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:15,508
Wait, I'm totally lost. You just said
that they're two different people.

440
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:19,676
Yeah. Two people the same age
from the same small town!

441
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:22,480
I looked it up.
It's a small town!

442
00:35:22,553 --> 00:35:24,851
Yeah, so what?

443
00:35:24,922 --> 00:35:27,482
Brooke, don't you think they would've
heard of each other, these guys?

444
00:35:27,558 --> 00:35:30,186
You know, growing up?
Gotten mixed up before?

445
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:33,424
Oliver didn't say anything like that.
He just threw the letter away.

446
00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:35,432
- Well, wait a minute.
- So...

447
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,162
There could be ten other Michael
Faradays in Northern Virginia.

448
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:41,569
- You would never know that.
- So I called Kansas State.

449
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:44,904
Here's what I'm saying.
Kansas State University...

450
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:48,104
had no Oliver Lang on record,
from that year or any year.

451
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:51,376
So either he didn't really
go to that school...

452
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:54,009
or that's not his real name.

453
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:57,816
Can I ask you something? Did you
do this to me when we started dating?

454
00:35:57,889 --> 00:35:59,880
- What?
- Call up my ex-boyfriends...

455
00:35:59,957 --> 00:36:01,925
and get my transcripts sent over?

456
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:04,325
You've got to admit,
there's something not right here.

457
00:36:04,395 --> 00:36:07,956
No, this isn't right.
You have invaded his privacy.

458
00:36:08,032 --> 00:36:11,195
So maybe he lied about where
he went to college. Big deal.

459
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:14,670
People lie about things all the time.
You don't have the right to spy on them.

460
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:17,435
God, you of all people.

461
00:36:19,076 --> 00:36:21,169
Are you teaching the Bill of Rights
this semester...

462
00:36:21,245 --> 00:36:23,839
or did that not make the program?

463
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:29,544
I don't know what you're doing.
We've made some friends here.

464
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:33,656
All right?

465
00:36:35,593 --> 00:36:37,527
See you tonight.

466
00:36:58,015 --> 00:36:59,448
Lang.

467
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:42,858
Shit.

468
00:37:58,976 --> 00:38:00,273
Fenimore.

469
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:06,272
'Cause you've never been away from
home before. You're nine years old.

470
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:08,443
Nine and a half.
There'll be grownups there.

471
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:11,386
The answer is no, Grant.

472
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:13,389
It's spring vacation.
You said I could go.

473
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:16,517
Well, now I'm saying
that you can't go, Grant!

474
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:23,058
Look, <i>maybe</i> you can go
for summer camp or something, okay?

475
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,534
- Brady's going.
- Brady might not be the best kid...

476
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:27,594
for you to be alone
in the woods with!

477
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:31,164
- The answer is no!
- He's my best friend.

478
00:38:36,414 --> 00:38:41,909
Look, you want to go to camp, we'll go
to Aunt Ruth's and Uncle Rob's cabin.

479
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,317
- Okay?
- That's a lie!

480
00:38:43,387 --> 00:38:47,881
- No it's not!
- You'll be too busy! You'll forget!

481
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:50,620
- You and me, we'll go...
- You'll forget you said I could go!

482
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:05,866
I hate him.

483
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:15,683
<i>The FBI keeps a file</i>
<i>on every American...</i>

484
00:39:15,753 --> 00:39:17,880
<i>who has ever been</i>
<i>charged with a crime.</i>

485
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:22,619
<i>Now, certain offenses</i>
<i>cause files to be flagged.</i>

486
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:24,684
<i>Two years ago, these flags....</i>

487
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:28,459
picked up a series of
suspicious firearms purchases...

488
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:31,467
in Maryland, Georgia
and the Carolinas.

489
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:33,730
Over a hundred guns from...

490
00:39:33,804 --> 00:39:36,364
assault rifles, army issues...

491
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:43,610
all bought by acquaintances
of Seaver Parsons...

492
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:47,640
husband, father of three,
amateur gun collector...

493
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:50,710
outspoken member of
the right-wing extremists...

494
00:39:50,788 --> 00:39:52,949
here in West Virginia.

495
00:39:53,023 --> 00:39:56,515
To the FBI, it appeared Parsons
was stockpiling weapons...

496
00:39:56,594 --> 00:39:58,562
for some sort of offensive.

497
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:03,560
So they sent four FBI agents...

498
00:40:03,634 --> 00:40:05,761
with a search warrant here...

499
00:40:07,104 --> 00:40:10,164
thinking that they would uncover
some sort of treasure chest...

500
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:13,267
of felony firearms.

501
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:18,448
- <i>Munitions for war.</i>
- 2-7 November, we got your eyeball.

502
00:40:24,522 --> 00:40:26,456
Backup's en route.

503
00:40:28,025 --> 00:40:30,357
How you gonna handle this, boss?

504
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,293
The easy way.

505
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:34,297
Yeah, I heard that.

506
00:40:38,669 --> 00:40:40,603
Hey, there, mister.

507
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:43,932
You catch yourself some dinner?

508
00:40:47,011 --> 00:40:50,606
Is that your house over there?

509
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:55,914
Know if your father's home, son?

510
00:40:55,986 --> 00:40:58,750
He don't know you.

511
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:01,849
- No, son, we're from Washington.
- <i>Here at this fence line....</i>

512
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:05,589
<i>they encounter Parson's</i>
<i>youngest son, age ten.</i>

513
00:41:06,764 --> 00:41:10,063
They asked him where his father was,
but they neglected...

514
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:14,969
they failed to first identify
themselves as Federal agents.

515
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:20,243
Run up and ask your dad to come outside.
We'd like to speak to him.

516
00:41:21,045 --> 00:41:22,171
Okay?

517
00:41:29,353 --> 00:41:30,786
- Cover the house!
- No, stay here!

518
00:41:30,855 --> 00:41:32,755
Move! Go!

519
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:34,984
Stay!

520
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:37,027
The kid doesn't know
why we're here!

521
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:39,828
<i>They're comin'!</i>

522
00:41:39,897 --> 00:41:42,195
Jeb, they're comin'!
They're here!

523
00:41:48,772 --> 00:41:50,364
Ma, they're here!

524
00:41:58,249 --> 00:42:00,479
<i>Cease fire!

525
00:42:13,964 --> 00:42:15,295
Ma!

526
00:42:41,091 --> 00:42:42,524
Go!

527
00:42:50,634 --> 00:42:52,568
Just hold on.

528
00:42:54,872 --> 00:42:57,739
<i>Pinned down,</i>
<i>they returned fire.</i>

529
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:02,570
Finally,
the reinforcements arrived.

530
00:43:04,448 --> 00:43:08,509
When it was over,
the siege lasted over two hours.

531
00:43:11,722 --> 00:43:16,659
At the end, Parson's
two eldest sons were wounded...

532
00:43:17,728 --> 00:43:21,425
his wife and his youngest boy
were killed.

533
00:43:22,633 --> 00:43:28,196
As for Parsons,
he wasn't even home.

534
00:44:14,885 --> 00:44:18,844
See, the FBI, they thought...

535
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:24,390
that their people were uncovering
some sort of terrorist plot.

536
00:44:24,461 --> 00:44:28,625
You see? But what their file,
their flags...

537
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:30,792
did not reveal to them...

538
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:37,137
was that Seaver Parsons had
come into a family inheritance...

539
00:44:37,207 --> 00:44:40,040
with which he had arranged
the hundred legal firearms...

540
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:42,044
to be legally purchased.

541
00:44:42,112 --> 00:44:46,310
Nor did it tell them that Parsons
had recently applied...

542
00:44:46,383 --> 00:44:48,908
for a sales license.

543
00:44:48,986 --> 00:44:52,888
Nor did it tell them that Parsons
warned his family...

544
00:44:52,956 --> 00:44:57,859
that some people might want
to steal his collection.

545
00:44:57,928 --> 00:45:01,125
He instructed his sons
and his wife...

546
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:03,826
and his <i>daughter-in-law....</i>

547
00:45:04,902 --> 00:45:10,306
never to let strangers on
this property while he was away...

548
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:13,207
and if force be taken,
then to defend with force.

549
00:45:13,277 --> 00:45:15,211
Defend the home!

550
00:45:18,682 --> 00:45:21,845
You know, he had no love
for the Federal Government.

551
00:45:21,919 --> 00:45:25,548
He did have a separatist
and suspicious past.

552
00:45:25,622 --> 00:45:29,991
But this was not a terrorist.
He was not a criminal.

553
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:34,121
Three innocent people
died that day...

554
00:45:34,198 --> 00:45:36,291
because the flags went up.

555
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:41,704
The flags were wrong.

556
00:46:01,024 --> 00:46:02,958
Don't just dive in.
I want you to think for yourself.

557
00:46:03,026 --> 00:46:04,994
- I want you to be safe.
- Let go of my hand.

558
00:46:05,062 --> 00:46:06,996
Okay. Hey, look.

559
00:46:07,064 --> 00:46:10,090
I want you to have
a great time, okay?

560
00:46:10,167 --> 00:46:13,295
Listen to your troop master,
all right?

561
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:15,770
Did Brooke tell you to let me go?

562
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:18,034
Yes, she did,
as a matter of fact.

563
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:22,408
She said you're a big guy and you could
handle ten days away. She's right.

564
00:46:22,479 --> 00:46:26,108
When I get back, will she...

565
00:46:26,183 --> 00:46:28,276
Is she gonna take Mom's place?

566
00:46:30,487 --> 00:46:32,978
Nobody is ever gonna
take your mom's place.

567
00:46:33,056 --> 00:46:34,990
Not Brooke, nobody.

568
00:46:35,058 --> 00:46:40,155
Mom is always gonna be with us,
right here...

569
00:46:41,098 --> 00:46:44,499
because we remember her like
nothing could ever take her away.

570
00:46:45,569 --> 00:46:50,268
If Brooke and I ever start thinking
about something like that...

571
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:52,638
we're gonna talk
to you about it first.

572
00:46:52,709 --> 00:46:57,146
She'll only ever live with us
if Mom says it's okay too.

573
00:46:58,315 --> 00:46:59,441
Okay.

574
00:47:01,919 --> 00:47:04,285
- You have a great time, okay?
- Thanks for camp, Dad.

575
00:47:05,622 --> 00:47:08,090
Have a good one.
All right.

576
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:10,956
- Thanks, Dad. See ya.
- All right. See ya later.

577
00:47:24,741 --> 00:47:27,403
<i>His name was William Fenimore...</i>

578
00:47:27,477 --> 00:47:30,878
<i>and I'm told he changed it</i>
<i>to Oliver Lang.</i>

579
00:47:30,948 --> 00:47:33,416
<i>It may take me a few moments, sir.</i>

580
00:47:42,759 --> 00:47:45,819
<i>Okay, we do have</i>
<i>a William Fenimore....</i>

581
00:47:45,896 --> 00:47:48,421
<i>of Carson, Kansas,</i>
<i>changed to an Oliver Lang.</i>

582
00:47:48,498 --> 00:47:51,558
Oh, do you know when that was?

583
00:47:51,635 --> 00:47:54,229
<i>October 5, 1981.</i>

584
00:47:54,304 --> 00:47:57,831
Oh, thank you very much.
That's exactly what I was looking for.

585
00:48:07,317 --> 00:48:09,251
<i>State of Kansas,</i>
<i>Department of Records.</i>

586
00:48:09,319 --> 00:48:13,881
Yes, hi. Michael Jones.
I'm with the EEOC in Washington.

587
00:48:13,957 --> 00:48:18,985
I've got a possible name change
I wanted to run by you guys.

588
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:22,896
I'm looking for an Oliver Lang.
He's out of Carson, Kansas.

589
00:48:22,966 --> 00:48:24,900
<i>Hold on, sir.</i>

590
00:48:28,438 --> 00:48:30,998
<i>Sir, I'm afraid I've got</i>
<i>nothing on any name change....</i>

591
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:33,440
<i>for an Oliver Lang</i>
<i>of Carson, Kansas.</i>

592
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:35,603
Okay, just doin' my job.
Thank you.

593
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:38,477
<i>Sir? Our records indicate</i>
<i>Oliver Lang deceased....</i>

594
00:48:38,548 --> 00:48:40,914
<i>as of October 4, 1981.</i>

595
00:48:40,984 --> 00:48:43,418
- October 4?
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

596
00:48:50,394 --> 00:48:54,194
What does
the death certificate say?

597
00:48:54,965 --> 00:48:58,799
<i>Cause of death is listed</i>
<i>as gunshot, hunting accident.</i>

598
00:49:00,203 --> 00:49:02,967
<i>You had said you were calling</i>
<i>with whom in Washington?</i>

599
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,871
Thank you.

600
00:49:09,246 --> 00:49:11,305
<i>Just run through this scenario with me.</i>

601
00:49:11,381 --> 00:49:14,782
Theoretically,
why would someone do that?

602
00:49:14,851 --> 00:49:18,252
Do what? Change his name to the name
of a person who died the day before?

603
00:49:18,322 --> 00:49:21,780
Yeah. Someone the same age
from the same hometown.

604
00:49:21,858 --> 00:49:25,692
Why? Would it be to take over
that person's life?

605
00:49:25,762 --> 00:49:27,696
No, that wouldn't work.

606
00:49:27,764 --> 00:49:30,494
When you die, the death certificate
goes both state and federal.

607
00:49:30,567 --> 00:49:34,765
Driver's licenses, Social Security
numbers, they're voided.

608
00:49:34,838 --> 00:49:38,501
- Can't do it to hide the person you are.
- Then why would you do it?

609
00:49:38,575 --> 00:49:41,806
You'd do it to hide
the person you were.

610
00:49:41,878 --> 00:49:44,403
Say you wanted to find out...

611
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:47,348
a criminal record for your guy
prior to the name change.

612
00:49:47,417 --> 00:49:51,353
- Unless you're a real professional...
- You'd check on the name he has now...

613
00:49:51,421 --> 00:49:54,413
And the records you'd find back then
would be for somebody else entirely.

614
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:58,393
That's the significance of making
the change right after a person's death.

615
00:49:58,462 --> 00:50:02,796
- No overlap.
- It gives you a whole new history.

616
00:50:02,866 --> 00:50:05,130
It helps the old one disappear.

617
00:50:07,971 --> 00:50:10,439
Is there <i>something</i> you want
to tell me, Michael?

618
00:50:11,575 --> 00:50:16,308
Whit, if I give you a name,
could you run it for flags?

619
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:19,213
- Jesus!
- Just this once.

620
00:50:19,282 --> 00:50:22,308
Check out files as a personal favor,
is that what you're <i>asking</i> me to do?

621
00:50:22,386 --> 00:50:24,718
- Come on, I'm not...
- You go to jail for that.

622
00:50:24,788 --> 00:50:27,382
- This is important.
- My pension's important.

623
00:50:27,457 --> 00:50:30,688
Whit, I'm asking you to run a name.

624
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:34,288
I'm not asking you to start surveillance
and break out the goddamn guns.

625
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:38,425
Faraday, if you'd asked your wife to
do it, she'd tell you the same thing.

626
00:50:38,502 --> 00:50:40,800
Get you classified FBI information.

627
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:43,465
She'd say,
"I love you, baby, but that...

628
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:45,474
I cannot do."

629
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:51,242
If you want to find out about somebody,
there's always ways to do it.

630
00:50:51,314 --> 00:50:55,614
They're just not through me.
Come on. Use your imagination.

631
00:51:07,931 --> 00:51:10,661
Oh, hi, Daphne.
How you doin'?

632
00:51:12,002 --> 00:51:13,697
You doing okay?

633
00:51:17,441 --> 00:51:20,899
- Hi, Hannah.
- Mommy and Daddy aren't home.

634
00:51:20,977 --> 00:51:25,175
Oh, well, actually,
I don't need your mom and dad.

635
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:29,344
You know what?
I locked myself out of my house.

636
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:33,685
- I came home from work and realized...
- We can't let strangers in.

637
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:36,590
Well, I'm not a stranger, right?

638
00:51:39,663 --> 00:51:42,996
See, what I need to do
is use your phone...

639
00:51:44,067 --> 00:51:48,936
to call up somebody to see if
they'll help me get in the house.

640
00:51:49,005 --> 00:51:51,974
Would that be all right...

641
00:51:52,809 --> 00:51:54,743
if I use your phone?

642
00:51:56,146 --> 00:51:59,707
- Kitchen.
- Good.

643
00:52:02,018 --> 00:52:04,782
I'm gonna use the phone
in your dad's study.

644
00:52:04,855 --> 00:52:07,653
- You guys are playin' here.
- That's Dad's study.

645
00:52:07,724 --> 00:52:11,125
I'II just be a sec.
You guys go ahead and play.

646
00:52:11,194 --> 00:52:13,128
Your dad won't mind.

647
00:52:24,441 --> 00:52:27,069
Hello. Yes, I've got a...

648
00:52:28,011 --> 00:52:29,945
a home lockout.

649
00:52:31,081 --> 00:52:33,413
I need your help to get back in.

650
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:36,251
Faraday, Michael.

651
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:44,656
2505 Arlington Road in Reston.

652
00:52:45,629 --> 00:52:48,154
No, that's no problem.

653
00:52:48,231 --> 00:52:50,961
I have identification.

654
00:53:58,301 --> 00:54:01,395
- You locked yourself out.
- Scared the shit out of me.

655
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:03,996
Yeah, I was on the phone...

656
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:07,168
and the picture was falling...
crooked... so l...

657
00:54:09,479 --> 00:54:11,709
Yeah, the locksmith guy's comin'.

658
00:54:11,781 --> 00:54:14,409
Good. Did you want to wait here?
I'm just back from the store.

659
00:54:14,484 --> 00:54:17,009
No thanks.

660
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:19,681
I got a call from Brady today.

661
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:22,281
He and Grant are having
a wonderful time.

662
00:54:22,359 --> 00:54:25,089
He went on and on about what kind
of bugs they're catching.

663
00:54:25,161 --> 00:54:27,527
I don't know if there's
any kind of badge for that.

664
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:29,997
Can I offer you something?

665
00:54:30,066 --> 00:54:32,000
No, I've got a...

666
00:54:32,068 --> 00:54:36,562
I should really get back. There's
some papers I can grade while I wait.

667
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:40,235
But thank you for the call.

668
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:41,709
Sure.

669
00:54:41,778 --> 00:54:44,076
Thank you, girls.

670
00:54:44,147 --> 00:54:46,240
Our house is your house.

671
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:56,888
Just a sec.
You forgot your case.

672
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,894
And your phone.

673
00:55:01,831 --> 00:55:03,856
Need to recharge my batteries.

674
00:55:03,933 --> 00:55:05,867
I know the feeling.

675
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:21,473
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Pretending to wait for a locksmith.

676
00:55:21,551 --> 00:55:24,019
- Right.
- Pretended to be locked out.

677
00:55:24,087 --> 00:55:27,250
Uh-huh.
Why was that again?

678
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:29,622
I'll explain it to you.

679
00:55:29,693 --> 00:55:32,025
Can we pretend
to have dinner first?

680
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:09,528
Hi, neighbor.

681
00:56:38,328 --> 00:56:39,590
"Pipe bomb."

682
00:56:47,504 --> 00:56:49,597
"Special state agency."

683
00:56:52,542 --> 00:56:55,306
"William Fenimore Senior."

684
00:56:55,378 --> 00:56:57,312
How's the hunting?

685
00:57:00,283 --> 00:57:01,716
Hey, Oliver.

686
00:57:04,554 --> 00:57:09,116
I was in the city on a project. Went by
your office. They said check here.

687
00:57:09,192 --> 00:57:13,185
- Got some research goin'?
- Yeah, the '70s...

688
00:57:14,798 --> 00:57:17,562
- Is that <i>The Kansas City Star?</i>
- Yeah.

689
00:57:17,634 --> 00:57:21,365
- That's the paper I read growin' up.
- It's for a lecture course.

690
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:23,804
I got a class...

691
00:57:23,873 --> 00:57:27,240
that deals with extremist groups.

692
00:57:28,344 --> 00:57:32,713
You know, American history.
Background on state militias.

693
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:35,649
There's one in Kansas.

694
00:57:35,718 --> 00:57:38,585
Seems they got one everywhere.

695
00:57:38,655 --> 00:57:41,624
Jeez, I didn't know you taught
a course in terrorism.

696
00:57:41,691 --> 00:57:44,558
- That a pretty frightening subject.
- Yeah.

697
00:57:48,064 --> 00:57:52,501
- You got time for a drink?
- No, today's not good.

698
00:57:52,569 --> 00:57:54,730
Yeah, I hear ya.
I got a building contract...

699
00:57:54,804 --> 00:57:58,205
that's kickin' my butt
tryin' to put it together.

700
00:57:58,274 --> 00:58:00,139
Get back to work.

701
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:03,475
Sorry to drop by.
Catch you back at the ranch.

702
00:58:03,546 --> 00:58:05,673
Good to see you.

703
00:58:08,918 --> 00:58:12,115
Will you just hear me out?
Hear what I'm saying?

704
00:58:12,188 --> 00:58:15,248
The guy changed his name, Brooke.
Why?

705
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:19,955
To help hide his background.
Why? Because there's something in it.

706
00:58:20,029 --> 00:58:21,997
Yeah, something that's
not your business.

707
00:58:22,065 --> 00:58:25,228
When he was 16 years old,
he tried to blow up some offices.

708
00:58:25,301 --> 00:58:30,102
Read the paper! A government agency
that was cheating his father's farm.

709
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:32,835
He served time
in a juvenile program.

710
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:36,577
Pipe bomb as a kid.

711
00:58:36,646 --> 00:58:40,104
Why would you
go to these lengths...

712
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:44,779
to hide that part of your history
if it wasn't an isolated event?

713
00:58:44,854 --> 00:58:46,981
If you thought you might
try it again someday?

714
00:58:47,056 --> 00:58:49,524
It says it didn't even go off.
He was a kid.

715
00:58:50,593 --> 00:58:55,087
Brady practically killed himself
with a bunch of fireworks in March.

716
00:58:55,164 --> 00:58:59,897
Come on! Where do you think
Brady gets an idea like that?

717
00:58:59,969 --> 00:59:02,494
What are you saying?

718
00:59:02,572 --> 00:59:06,133
I'm saying that he's gone to these
great lengths to hide his past.

719
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:10,043
I'm saying that he was in St. Louis
when the federal building was bombed.

720
00:59:10,113 --> 00:59:13,981
And I'm saying that there is
a blueprint in his house...

721
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:16,484
that he does not want me to see!

722
00:59:20,657 --> 00:59:23,319
- Are you <i>listening</i> to yourself?
- Are you listening to me?

723
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:25,452
- Your neighbor?
- Yes!

724
00:59:25,528 --> 00:59:27,996
Is a terrorist?

725
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:30,362
He's been blowing up buildings?

726
00:59:30,433 --> 00:59:34,961
There's something going on over there.
Something is being planned.

727
00:59:35,038 --> 00:59:37,563
Something's being planned?
Yeah, and in his spare time...

728
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:41,235
hey pays the mortgage
and takes his kid to camp.

729
00:59:41,311 --> 00:59:45,805
- That house is not normal.
- That house is normal!

730
00:59:45,882 --> 00:59:48,350
Remember when we were over there
the other night?

731
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:50,978
- Him discussing politics?
- Yeah, we disagree about politics.

732
00:59:51,054 --> 00:59:54,217
And Washington?
And Leah?

733
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:56,258
- Do you remember this?
- Oh, my...

734
00:59:56,326 --> 00:59:58,658
The guy is testing me.

735
00:59:58,728 --> 01:00:02,095
He wants to see
if I'm an enemy or an ally.

736
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:06,657
You are the one who brought up Leah.

737
01:00:06,736 --> 01:00:09,637
Is that what this is about?

738
01:00:09,706 --> 01:00:12,174
No, it's not about Leah!

739
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:18,479
You know, this class...

740
01:00:18,548 --> 01:00:21,210
that you slave over...

741
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:26,119
to carry on Leah's work,
to have <i>something</i> in her memory?

742
01:00:29,659 --> 01:00:33,322
You know,
plots and conspiracies...

743
01:00:33,396 --> 01:00:35,990
and red flags going up.

744
01:00:36,065 --> 01:00:39,091
Yeah, this is Leah's world now.

745
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:42,762
I'm...

746
01:00:50,046 --> 01:00:51,638
I can't.

747
01:00:54,584 --> 01:00:57,018
Listen, I <i>know....</i>

748
01:00:57,086 --> 01:01:00,613
that he's changed his name...

749
01:01:00,690 --> 01:01:03,318
- Stop it, for me.
- He lived in St Louis...

750
01:01:03,393 --> 01:01:06,191
when the bombs were goin' off.

751
01:01:06,262 --> 01:01:09,698
He's working on this building
that he doesn't want me to see.

752
01:01:14,137 --> 01:01:16,071
I don't think
I can stay here tonight.

753
01:01:17,707 --> 01:01:20,232
I'm not staying.

754
01:02:34,217 --> 01:02:36,447
Never did like that picture.

755
01:02:39,288 --> 01:02:41,222
You know me, Michael?

756
01:02:42,291 --> 01:02:44,259
You think you know me?

757
01:02:45,862 --> 01:02:48,831
Yeah, you know me better
than I know myself, don't you?

758
01:02:49,832 --> 01:02:52,300
<i>Kansas City Star.</i>
I saw you.

759
01:02:52,368 --> 01:02:54,996
You wanna tell me something
I don't know?

760
01:02:56,472 --> 01:02:59,908
- I know what I read.
- You know a 16-year-old kid.

761
01:03:02,011 --> 01:03:04,036
You don't know me.

762
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:06,274
You know a kid at 16.

763
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:11,987
Damn you!
You've been a guest in my house!

764
01:03:12,054 --> 01:03:14,852
You're a guest in mine, Fenimore.

765
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:18,688
Bill, Will, William...
What do I call you?

766
01:03:18,761 --> 01:03:22,788
Who the hell do you think you are
judging me? What gives you the right?

767
01:03:26,135 --> 01:03:28,103
You ever worked on a farm?

768
01:03:33,176 --> 01:03:35,770
Make your living,
support your family?

769
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:43,150
The government stole my father's water...
a stream running through our land.

770
01:03:43,219 --> 01:03:45,813
Said they were appropriating it
for other uses.

771
01:03:47,423 --> 01:03:51,519
We couldn't grow crops,
we couldn't raise cattle.

772
01:03:51,594 --> 01:03:54,028
We had loans we couldn't pay.

773
01:03:55,965 --> 01:03:57,899
My father woke up one mornin'...

774
01:03:57,967 --> 01:04:01,459
and he realized
he was worth more dead than alive.

775
01:04:03,005 --> 01:04:05,667
His skin and bones...

776
01:04:05,741 --> 01:04:08,539
were worth more
in insurance money...

777
01:04:08,611 --> 01:04:10,909
than as a damn farmer.

778
01:04:13,716 --> 01:04:16,651
I found his tractor...

779
01:04:16,719 --> 01:04:19,688
at the bottom of the bluffs
behind our house.

780
01:04:19,755 --> 01:04:21,689
He made it look like an accident.

781
01:04:21,757 --> 01:04:26,717
I found his body.
And the note?

782
01:04:28,965 --> 01:04:30,956
He wrote it to me.

783
01:04:37,006 --> 01:04:39,770
Insurance money paid off
what Mom could...

784
01:04:39,842 --> 01:04:42,436
but it wasn't enough.

785
01:04:43,512 --> 01:04:47,676
Neighbors...
Neighbors took our land at auction.

786
01:04:49,252 --> 01:04:52,915
All because some bureaucrat
stuck a pin in a map...

787
01:04:54,624 --> 01:04:58,424
in some creek in the middle of Kansas,
said we couldn't use our own water.

788
01:04:58,494 --> 01:05:00,428
Doesn't give you the right
to build a bomb.

789
01:05:00,496 --> 01:05:04,159
I was sixteen.
Sixteen!

790
01:05:04,233 --> 01:05:07,327
You ever do anything wrong
when you were 16?

791
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:10,903
You ever crash your car?

792
01:05:10,973 --> 01:05:15,672
You ever, uh, steal anything?
You ever screw the wrong girl?

793
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:18,407
You gonna tell your kid everything
you did when you were 16?

794
01:05:18,481 --> 01:05:21,143
The lies you told?
The drugs you took?

795
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:25,053
I've been judged for this!

796
01:05:25,121 --> 01:05:29,785
I got sent away for it, and it was
the best thing that ever happened to me.

797
01:05:29,859 --> 01:05:31,793
The best thing.

798
01:05:38,567 --> 01:05:40,159
Who's Oliver?

799
01:05:48,377 --> 01:05:50,709
He was my best friend growin' up.

800
01:05:53,883 --> 01:05:56,613
He died when we were both 25.

801
01:05:59,121 --> 01:06:01,055
I did it to honor him...

802
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:05,226
to carry on his name.

803
01:06:07,229 --> 01:06:09,163
And to hide.

804
01:06:10,633 --> 01:06:12,567
Yeah, to hide.

805
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:17,697
I didn't want any son I had
knowing what I did.

806
01:06:19,909 --> 01:06:23,470
I didn't want my kids
to be burdened...

807
01:06:23,546 --> 01:06:26,606
with people looking through
old newspapers.

808
01:06:28,951 --> 01:06:31,613
I'm not proud of this.

809
01:06:33,923 --> 01:06:35,948
This isn't pride.

810
01:06:38,361 --> 01:06:40,989
I wish it never happened.

811
01:06:42,898 --> 01:06:46,459
You know, I wish to <i>God....</i>

812
01:06:46,535 --> 01:06:49,265
that my family could have...

813
01:06:49,338 --> 01:06:52,000
my father's good name.

814
01:06:57,613 --> 01:07:00,741
You know, you have a right
to know who lives next door...

815
01:07:00,816 --> 01:07:05,549
who talks to your kid,
who considers himself your friend.

816
01:07:07,189 --> 01:07:09,885
But you also have the right...

817
01:07:09,959 --> 01:07:13,019
If you have a problem with me,
if you have issues with <i>me....</i>

818
01:07:14,897 --> 01:07:18,333
you could have the decency
to walk across the street...

819
01:07:18,401 --> 01:07:21,063
and tell me to my face.

820
01:11:29,752 --> 01:11:32,516
<i>Hi, this is Michael.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>

821
01:11:32,588 --> 01:11:34,886
It's me. Listen.

822
01:11:34,957 --> 01:11:38,256
I think you're right.
I saw <i>Oliver....</i>

823
01:11:38,327 --> 01:11:41,956
at the mall in the garage.

824
01:11:42,031 --> 01:11:45,762
He switched cars with somebody,
and I followed him...

825
01:11:45,834 --> 01:11:48,098
to this warehouse delivery place.

826
01:11:50,339 --> 01:11:54,639
They were unloading
these long, metal boxes.

827
01:11:56,679 --> 01:12:01,116
I want to talk to you.
I'm coming over, okay?

828
01:12:09,525 --> 01:12:11,220
I knew it was you.

829
01:12:17,366 --> 01:12:19,300
What are you doing here?

830
01:12:22,571 --> 01:12:26,564
Just shopping.
What are you doing here?

831
01:12:28,644 --> 01:12:30,236
Shopping.

832
01:12:33,682 --> 01:12:35,479
Great.

833
01:12:35,551 --> 01:12:37,143
Yeah.

834
01:12:56,538 --> 01:13:00,338
<i>They say a man was shot several times</i>
<i>while driving along 19th street.</i>

835
01:13:00,409 --> 01:13:04,140
<i>The car struck several other vehicles</i>
<i>before slamming into a tree.</i>

836
01:13:04,213 --> 01:13:07,341
<i>The victim was pronounced</i>
<i>dead at the scene.</i>

837
01:13:07,416 --> 01:13:09,577
<i>Elsewhere, a single-car accident</i>
<i>near Reston is tying up....</i>

838
01:13:09,651 --> 01:13:12,711
<i>evening traffic on westbound</i>
<i>Route</i> 7 <i>at this hour.</i>

839
01:13:12,788 --> 01:13:15,518
<i>Details are sketchy at this point.</i>
<i>What we can tell you...</i>

840
01:13:15,591 --> 01:13:17,821
<i>from our overhead shot is that</i>
<i>the accident took place....</i>

841
01:13:17,893 --> 01:13:20,088
<i>near the Pine Glenn Outlet Center.</i>

842
01:13:20,162 --> 01:13:22,460
<i>No other vehicles appear to be</i>
<i>involved in what police say...</i>

843
01:13:22,531 --> 01:13:24,123
<i>is a fatal crash.</i>

844
01:13:24,199 --> 01:13:27,726
<i>We'll have more information for you</i>
<i>when it becomes available.</i>

845
01:13:29,972 --> 01:13:32,736
<i>The driver of the car, described</i>
<i>as a woman in her mid-20s...</i>

846
01:13:32,808 --> 01:13:34,776
<i>has been pronounced dead</i>
<i>at the scene.</i>

847
01:13:34,843 --> 01:13:38,370
<i>Police say it appears she lost control</i>
<i>of the light blue 1989 Mustang...</i>

848
01:13:38,447 --> 01:13:41,075
<i>and crashed through a guardrail</i>
<i>along the ravine.</i>

849
01:13:41,150 --> 01:13:44,642
<i>Investigators believe</i>
<i>she was killed upon impact--</i>

850
01:14:04,606 --> 01:14:06,733
Sir, you can't go down there.

851
01:14:06,809 --> 01:14:09,107
Sir, you can't come down here.

852
01:14:09,178 --> 01:14:11,078
- You can't go down there.
- Where is she?

853
01:14:13,982 --> 01:14:16,007
- She's gone sir. Been taken away.
- Where?

854
01:14:19,254 --> 01:14:21,518
- She's gone.
- Where?

855
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:23,182
I'm sorry.

856
01:15:04,867 --> 01:15:06,732
<i>Hey, General,</i>
<i>how you holding up?</i>

857
01:15:06,802 --> 01:15:09,362
<i>You wouldn't believe it!</i>
<i>It's so cool.</i>

858
01:15:09,438 --> 01:15:12,669
We went swimming and climbing, and
one night there was a lightning storm.

859
01:15:12,741 --> 01:15:15,733
- <i>We had to stay in a motel!</i>
- You did?

860
01:15:15,811 --> 01:15:19,212
<i>I learned how to make campfires,</i>
<i>and there's lots of knives.</i>

861
01:15:19,281 --> 01:15:23,183
- Me and Brady can tell animal tracks.
- <i>That's terrific.</i>

862
01:15:23,252 --> 01:15:25,652
<i>I've gotta go.</i>
<i>Troop Master's calling us.</i>

863
01:15:25,721 --> 01:15:28,189
- <i>We're doing a hike!</i>
- Okay. Grant?

864
01:15:28,257 --> 01:15:30,817
I'll see you in a couple of days.
I love you.

865
01:15:30,893 --> 01:15:32,758
- I gotta go!
- <i>Grant?</i>

866
01:15:42,471 --> 01:15:45,497
It's better to tell him
when he gets back.

867
01:15:52,614 --> 01:15:54,582
Thanks for coming to get me.

868
01:15:54,650 --> 01:15:58,552
If there's anything you need...

869
01:15:58,620 --> 01:16:00,645
we're here.

870
01:16:00,722 --> 01:16:04,180
No, I won't.
I'll be fine.

871
01:16:07,195 --> 01:16:10,460
Don't let yourself... I mean, sometimes
it's better not to be alone...

872
01:16:10,532 --> 01:16:12,500
when you don't have to be.

873
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:14,502
She was a good person.

874
01:16:16,371 --> 01:16:19,306
Kind, kind girl.

875
01:16:19,374 --> 01:16:21,103
You know, if l...

876
01:16:21,176 --> 01:16:24,168
If I haven't been myself
these past few weeks...

877
01:16:27,416 --> 01:16:29,816
I'm sorry, for everything.

878
01:16:31,119 --> 01:16:33,417
She liked you...

879
01:16:33,488 --> 01:16:35,752
and your family very much.

880
01:16:40,128 --> 01:16:43,325
We're here for you.
We really are.

881
01:17:15,897 --> 01:17:18,195
- Hello?
- <i>Michael, it's Whit.</i>

882
01:17:18,266 --> 01:17:20,598
Haven't heard back from you, man.

883
01:17:24,606 --> 01:17:26,938
My girlfriend, Brooke,
was killed Friday.

884
01:17:27,009 --> 01:17:30,809
- Oh, God. No.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

885
01:17:32,381 --> 01:17:34,315
Can I talk to you later?

886
01:17:34,383 --> 01:17:38,183
Yeah, sure, whenever.
I'm here at the office.

887
01:17:38,253 --> 01:17:39,845
Thanks.

888
01:17:56,738 --> 01:17:59,070
- Agent Carver.
- <i>Whit?</i>

889
01:17:59,141 --> 01:18:02,907
What did you mean,
you haven't heard back from me?

890
01:18:02,978 --> 01:18:06,209
<i>The message I left on Friday.</i>
<i>I understand now.</i>

891
01:18:06,281 --> 01:18:09,250
- <i>It's all right.</i>
- What message?

892
01:18:09,317 --> 01:18:11,911
<i>Well, the one about</i>
<i>speaking to your class.</i>

893
01:18:11,987 --> 01:18:17,152
I thought with some ground rules,
we could set some things straight.

894
01:18:17,225 --> 01:18:19,750
Wait, wait, wait.
You called me Friday?

895
01:18:19,828 --> 01:18:22,991
- You left a message?
- Yeah, at the house.

896
01:18:27,936 --> 01:18:30,370
When did you call?

897
01:18:30,439 --> 01:18:34,375
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>Around 4:00 or 5:00, maybe, on Friday.</i>

898
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:41,543
I didn't have any messages.

899
01:18:41,616 --> 01:18:44,210
<i>For Christ's sakes,</i>
<i>you just found out about Brooke.</i>

900
01:18:44,286 --> 01:18:48,552
No, I didn't have any messages.
I'll call you back.

901
01:18:57,332 --> 01:18:59,300
Whit, listen to me.

902
01:18:59,367 --> 01:19:01,892
<i>I know you can't do anything for me</i>
<i>or get me information...</i>

903
01:19:01,970 --> 01:19:03,631
but I can give you information.

904
01:19:03,705 --> 01:19:07,641
The other day when I was talking about
somebody trying to hide their history?

905
01:19:07,709 --> 01:19:11,805
I was talking about my neighbor.
Oliver Lang... that's his name.

906
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:14,314
He used to be...

907
01:19:14,382 --> 01:19:19,081
It used to be William Fenimore. Run it
through your system, see what you got.

908
01:19:19,154 --> 01:19:21,952
- <i>Oliver Lang. You writing this down?</i>
- All right, slow down.

909
01:19:22,023 --> 01:19:24,651
This guy has a history, damn it!
Will you run the name?

910
01:19:24,726 --> 01:19:27,194
- Wait. What's he done?
- If I'm right...

911
01:19:27,262 --> 01:19:29,992
there are other people who called
my house that day, not just you.

912
01:19:30,065 --> 01:19:32,295
Find out. You can do that.
Please.

913
01:19:32,367 --> 01:19:34,927
- <i>I'll call you when I get back.</i>
- Where the hell are you going?

914
01:19:35,003 --> 01:19:36,664
To get you proof.
Run the name, Whit.

915
01:20:25,353 --> 01:20:27,287
<i>Was it hard to find me?</i>

916
01:20:28,557 --> 01:20:31,025
You've moved several times.

917
01:20:31,092 --> 01:20:34,960
Your wife said that...
Your ex-wife said...

918
01:20:35,030 --> 01:20:38,158
People know whose father I am.

919
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:45,003
Mister, I've been through
all this before.

920
01:20:45,073 --> 01:20:47,667
The government, the police...

921
01:20:49,444 --> 01:20:51,036
and writers.

922
01:20:53,615 --> 01:20:56,345
People wanted to believe
it was political...

923
01:20:56,418 --> 01:20:59,046
some conspiracy, some group.

924
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:02,351
Happy and I did too.

925
01:21:02,424 --> 01:21:04,619
Dean was not a strong boy.

926
01:21:04,693 --> 01:21:07,161
He was impressionable...

927
01:21:07,229 --> 01:21:10,164
believed what friends
around him said.

928
01:21:10,232 --> 01:21:13,099
Well, why couldn't he be involved...

929
01:21:13,168 --> 01:21:15,693
with people who could set him <i>up....</i>

930
01:21:15,770 --> 01:21:18,295
talk him into even this?

931
01:21:21,209 --> 01:21:25,475
The FBI, the police,
found nothing.

932
01:21:27,215 --> 01:21:32,016
It was him alone.
They decided this.

933
01:21:32,087 --> 01:21:34,078
Sixty-three dead...

934
01:21:35,557 --> 01:21:37,650
over taxes.

935
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:40,650
Dean alone.

936
01:21:40,729 --> 01:21:43,323
You don't believe that, do you?

937
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:47,034
I've never believed that.

938
01:21:47,102 --> 01:21:50,503
Have you heard the name
Oliver Lang or William Fenimore?

939
01:21:50,572 --> 01:21:52,506
I've heard too many names.

940
01:21:52,574 --> 01:21:56,237
Your son, Dean, was an electrician.

941
01:21:56,311 --> 01:21:59,906
Maybe he was contracted <i>for....</i>

942
01:21:59,981 --> 01:22:03,280
or he worked on a project...

943
01:22:03,351 --> 01:22:06,946
All of this
was investigated, mister!

944
01:22:07,022 --> 01:22:10,048
His neighbors, his customers...

945
01:22:10,125 --> 01:22:12,252
kids he grew up with
months ago.

946
01:22:12,327 --> 01:22:15,558
Dr. Scobee, I'm sorry
for bringing this all back.

947
01:22:15,630 --> 01:22:17,564
It never goes away.

948
01:22:17,632 --> 01:22:20,533
I had to come here.
You've got to understand.

949
01:22:20,602 --> 01:22:22,570
I think I know a man
who knew your son.

950
01:22:22,637 --> 01:22:25,606
He's 41, a structural engineer.

951
01:22:25,674 --> 01:22:28,609
He's got a wife, three kids.
He has this...

952
01:22:28,677 --> 01:22:31,475
May I ask what makes you so sure...

953
01:22:31,546 --> 01:22:34,879
that this man of yours had anything
to do with what happened here?

954
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:38,215
For the same reason you're sure
your son didn't do it alone!

955
01:22:38,286 --> 01:22:42,814
I know my son was not alone,
because 10 children died that day!

956
01:22:42,891 --> 01:22:46,725
The day care center in the Roosevelt,
he had to know it was there.

957
01:22:46,795 --> 01:22:49,423
My son would never have done
anything to harm children.

958
01:22:49,497 --> 01:22:51,727
Your son didn't have any children.

959
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:53,700
No!

960
01:22:53,768 --> 01:22:57,363
But he did things for them.

961
01:22:57,439 --> 01:23:00,306
He sponsored boys
from city shelters.

962
01:23:00,375 --> 01:23:05,677
Discoverer Troops. He coached
boys' football when he had time.

963
01:23:05,747 --> 01:23:08,341
Wait. Discoverer Troops?

964
01:23:10,852 --> 01:23:13,116
They're like Boy Scouts,
but for young children.

965
01:23:18,326 --> 01:23:21,159
He was a grown-up chaperon.

966
01:23:21,229 --> 01:23:26,064
He'd take them camping,
go to their meetings.

967
01:23:26,134 --> 01:23:29,797
Teach them.
There he is.

968
01:23:29,871 --> 01:23:32,601
It must have been
on some weekend adventure.

969
01:23:35,844 --> 01:23:39,109
Dean was best with children.

970
01:24:01,636 --> 01:24:03,035
Airport.

971
01:24:05,073 --> 01:24:07,598
Faraday, Grant Faraday.
I'll be there in a few hours.

972
01:24:07,675 --> 01:24:11,133
Don't let him go anywhere.
I'm coming. Tell him I'm <i>coming.</i>

973
01:24:26,828 --> 01:24:31,856
I'm here to pick up my son.
I called earlier this afternoon.

974
01:24:31,933 --> 01:24:34,060
- My son!
- What was that troop, sir?

975
01:24:34,135 --> 01:24:36,729
Troop? I don't know what troop.

976
01:24:36,805 --> 01:24:39,205
He's from Reston.
Grant Faraday.

977
01:24:41,443 --> 01:24:43,434
- Where's my son?
- Faraday.

978
01:24:44,813 --> 01:24:46,371
He was taken home
this afternoon, sir.

979
01:24:46,448 --> 01:24:48,678
- No.
- His father called.

980
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:51,344
No, no, wait.
I'm his father. I called.

981
01:24:51,419 --> 01:24:55,253
But you called twice, sir.

982
01:24:55,323 --> 01:24:58,224
You said that there had been
an accident at home?

983
01:24:58,293 --> 01:25:00,193
- A car accident?
- No!

984
01:25:00,261 --> 01:25:02,559
You asked to speak
with his troop master, sir.

985
01:25:02,630 --> 01:25:04,621
I'm his goddamn father!
That wasn't me.

986
01:25:04,732 --> 01:25:07,200
Here it is, sir.
He was driven home.

987
01:25:07,268 --> 01:25:10,760
- By who?
- His troop master, sir.

988
01:25:13,608 --> 01:25:17,601
- He and another boy.
- What other boy?

989
01:25:17,679 --> 01:25:19,647
Lang, Brady Lang.

990
01:25:20,949 --> 01:25:24,248
The troop master left
with both of them.

991
01:27:13,561 --> 01:27:17,190
You're doing it again. I thought
I told you to come to me...

992
01:27:17,265 --> 01:27:19,199
- if there's something you wanna know.
- Where's my son?

993
01:27:19,267 --> 01:27:21,201
He's with mine. They're safe.
Can I get you something?

994
01:27:21,269 --> 01:27:23,203
- I saved his life!
- Some punch? What's that?

995
01:27:23,271 --> 01:27:25,501
- Your son, I saved his life!
- Yes, yes.

996
01:27:25,573 --> 01:27:27,768
And that's why
you're still here with us.

997
01:27:27,842 --> 01:27:30,640
- And Brooke?
- Brooke got in the way.

998
01:27:30,712 --> 01:27:33,010
We're on a schedule.
It's nothing personal.

999
01:27:33,081 --> 01:27:35,811
What the hell have you done
with my son?

1000
01:27:35,883 --> 01:27:39,842
If you want to be his father,
you'll walk to your house...

1001
01:27:39,921 --> 01:27:43,152
sleep in your bed,
teach your classes and live your life.

1002
01:27:43,224 --> 01:27:46,057
What are you telling me?
How many people are you gonna kill?

1003
01:27:46,127 --> 01:27:49,722
Well, if I see
any strange cars on my street...

1004
01:27:49,797 --> 01:27:53,130
if you feel compelled to talk
to anyone... a federal agent, perhaps...

1005
01:27:53,201 --> 01:27:56,227
then I imagine
we're just gonna kill one.

1006
01:27:56,304 --> 01:27:58,795
He's nine years old.

1007
01:27:58,873 --> 01:28:01,501
When will he be ten?

1008
01:28:04,545 --> 01:28:06,479
He's a good kid.

1009
01:28:06,547 --> 01:28:08,515
A strong kid.

1010
01:28:08,583 --> 01:28:12,576
Reminds me of a boy I grew up with.
Maybe you've heard of him.

1011
01:28:12,654 --> 01:28:16,055
Oliver Lang?

1012
01:28:16,124 --> 01:28:18,752
I found him in the woods one day.

1013
01:28:18,826 --> 01:28:21,818
I would hate for Grant
to see the same for you.

1014
01:28:21,896 --> 01:28:25,730
- You sick fuck!
- You're the sick fuck!

1015
01:28:33,574 --> 01:28:35,508
I promise you, Michael.

1016
01:28:37,845 --> 01:28:41,076
If you stay a good neighbor,
and you are a good a neighbor...

1017
01:28:43,217 --> 01:28:45,151
you'll have him back.

1018
01:28:45,219 --> 01:28:50,350
But if you don't calm down, I don't know
that I can guarantee his safety.

1019
01:28:51,993 --> 01:28:55,360
- This will all be over in a few days.
- When?

1020
01:28:55,430 --> 01:28:58,922
- You're not in any danger.
- When? Tell me.

1021
01:29:02,337 --> 01:29:03,929
Please.

1022
01:29:06,140 --> 01:29:08,438
Because of you, my son is alive.

1023
01:29:10,611 --> 01:29:13,409
I would like very much
to return the favor.

1024
01:29:16,050 --> 01:29:18,109
Now...

1025
01:29:18,186 --> 01:29:20,120
we're having a party.

1026
01:29:22,557 --> 01:29:25,651
You're more than welcome to stay.

1027
01:30:32,994 --> 01:30:35,189
You're a hard man to find.

1028
01:30:35,263 --> 01:30:37,527
What are you, uh...

1029
01:30:37,598 --> 01:30:42,501
Your assistant told me you've been
taking long walks between classes.

1030
01:30:42,570 --> 01:30:45,198
Yeah, I can't talk to you now.

1031
01:30:45,273 --> 01:30:48,071
No? Can you talk to me ever?

1032
01:30:49,944 --> 01:30:52,538
You look like shit.
What's going on?

1033
01:30:55,950 --> 01:30:59,317
- I'm here about Oliver Lang.
- I gotta get to my class.

1034
01:30:59,387 --> 01:31:02,914
Well, how about
you teach me something?

1035
01:31:02,990 --> 01:31:06,517
Oliver Lang,
formerly William Fenimore.

1036
01:31:06,594 --> 01:31:09,495
We gave him a good look
after the St. Louis thing.

1037
01:31:09,564 --> 01:31:13,091
Everybody who ever used a bomb
got a good look.

1038
01:31:13,167 --> 01:31:15,101
His name change was legal.

1039
01:31:15,169 --> 01:31:18,263
We ran his social security number
through the National Crime Center.

1040
01:31:18,339 --> 01:31:22,639
Not a mark on his record ever since.
Him and everyone he knew came up clean.

1041
01:31:27,515 --> 01:31:29,949
That's what you found out about, huh?

1042
01:31:32,153 --> 01:31:36,317
Yeah, that Wichita shit back when
he was 16 got you thinking, huh?

1043
01:31:36,390 --> 01:31:40,258
Do you have something new on him
or do you just not like him...

1044
01:31:40,328 --> 01:31:41,852
in your neighborhood?

1045
01:31:41,929 --> 01:31:46,491
'Cause if this is all you got, then
you need to stop teaching that class...

1046
01:31:46,567 --> 01:31:48,592
'cause it's gettin' inside your head.

1047
01:31:48,669 --> 01:31:52,070
You tell me you got something
to go on and I'll go...

1048
01:31:52,139 --> 01:31:55,199
but I'm not gonna walk into another
Copper Creek, and neither should you.

1049
01:31:55,276 --> 01:31:59,610
I got nothing.
I'm sorry.

1050
01:32:01,816 --> 01:32:03,750
All right. Look.

1051
01:32:06,020 --> 01:32:08,545
I ran those phone records,
like you asked.

1052
01:32:08,623 --> 01:32:11,751
Could've meant my job,
but I did it.

1053
01:32:11,826 --> 01:32:14,158
Two telephone calls that Friday...
one from me...

1054
01:32:14,228 --> 01:32:18,289
and another from a pay phone
out Route 180, Pine Glenn Outlets.

1055
01:32:18,366 --> 01:32:19,697
Pine Glenn?

1056
01:32:21,002 --> 01:32:24,494
A telephone call from your neighbor.
Nothing.

1057
01:32:30,912 --> 01:32:32,846
Talk to me, Michael.

1058
01:32:34,215 --> 01:32:36,149
What's going on?

1059
01:32:38,452 --> 01:32:40,386
Talk to me.

1060
01:32:48,329 --> 01:32:50,263
Give up the goddamn class.

1061
01:32:56,938 --> 01:32:59,304
I'd like to rent a car
tomorrow morning.

1062
01:32:59,373 --> 01:33:01,739
How early could I pick that up?

1063
01:33:04,378 --> 01:33:06,312
<i>Michael Faraday.</i>

1064
01:33:49,657 --> 01:33:51,056
Oliver Lang, please.

1065
01:33:51,125 --> 01:33:53,525
<i>Mr. Lang is out of the office.</i>
<i>Would you like to leave a message?</i>

1066
01:33:53,594 --> 01:33:55,585
I need to reach him.
This is a business emergency.

1067
01:33:55,663 --> 01:33:58,894
<i>Mr. Lang isn't expected in this morning.</i>

1068
01:33:58,966 --> 01:34:01,366
- I'll call back. Thanks.
- <i>Is there something else...</i>

1069
01:34:01,435 --> 01:34:03,630
No.

1070
01:37:56,670 --> 01:38:01,130
Hey, neighbor, you all right?
What you doin' on this side of town?

1071
01:38:04,078 --> 01:38:06,546
Had to know, didn't ya?
Had to know.

1072
01:38:06,614 --> 01:38:09,174
Couldn't leave your neighbor alone.

1073
01:38:24,164 --> 01:38:26,189
Didn't you check up on me?

1074
01:38:26,267 --> 01:38:28,292
Didn't you?

1075
01:38:28,369 --> 01:38:30,963
Did you really think
we'd leave anything to chance?

1076
01:38:31,038 --> 01:38:33,472
<i>Fifty-one.</i>

1077
01:38:33,540 --> 01:38:36,771
I've got your shadow.
Go ahead. We're still on schedule.

1078
01:38:40,514 --> 01:38:43,244
- You gonna miss your son, Michael?
- Please.

1079
01:38:43,317 --> 01:38:46,343
You've given me no choice!

1080
01:38:46,420 --> 01:38:50,356
You think I wanted this?
I told you you were gonna get him back!

1081
01:38:50,424 --> 01:38:53,860
How am I gonna do that now?
How am I gonna trust you now?

1082
01:38:53,928 --> 01:38:56,920
Where are you taking him?
Where's the bomb?

1083
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:03,692
I'm a messenger, Michael.
I'm a messenger!

1084
01:39:03,771 --> 01:39:06,205
There's millions of us,
waiting to take up arms...

1085
01:39:06,273 --> 01:39:08,468
ready to spread the word.

1086
01:39:08,542 --> 01:39:09,873
Millions of us!

1087
01:39:09,944 --> 01:39:12,139
The government's
not who you're killing!

1088
01:39:12,212 --> 01:39:15,613
Yes, yes, they'll pay.
They'll pay for their sins...

1089
01:39:15,683 --> 01:39:17,480
- You're killing children!
- Their lies, their children.

1090
01:39:17,551 --> 01:39:19,280
- Children die!
- This is war.

1091
01:39:19,353 --> 01:39:21,548
In a war, children die.

1092
01:39:21,622 --> 01:39:23,817
- You're with us!
- No!

1093
01:39:46,647 --> 01:39:49,514
<i>Liberty Two, status.</i>

1094
01:39:50,851 --> 01:39:52,512
<i>Status one, go.</i>

1095
01:39:52,586 --> 01:39:55,680
That's what you stand for.

1096
01:39:55,756 --> 01:39:59,123
You tell them you stand for
blowing up families...

1097
01:39:59,193 --> 01:40:01,127
for orphan sons.

1098
01:40:02,896 --> 01:40:06,525
Your father really kill himself,
you son of a bitch?

1099
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:08,693
Or is that just one of your
goddamn stories?

1100
01:40:10,270 --> 01:40:13,671
- Call it off!
- It's for you, Michael.

1101
01:40:13,741 --> 01:40:15,800
- It's for all of us.
- It's not for me. Call it off!

1102
01:40:16,944 --> 01:40:19,936
Are you happy in your godless,
suburban life?

1103
01:40:20,014 --> 01:40:22,380
Call off the bomb!

1104
01:40:22,449 --> 01:40:25,282
Call off the fuckin' bomb!

1105
01:40:29,189 --> 01:40:31,316
They sent your wife
to her death.

1106
01:40:31,392 --> 01:40:34,361
Surely you won't be sorry
to see them go.

1107
01:40:41,635 --> 01:40:43,227
You're too late!

1108
01:41:16,603 --> 01:41:18,594
Let's get it done.

1109
01:41:28,816 --> 01:41:30,215
- Agent Carver.
- <i>Listen to me.</i>

1110
01:41:30,284 --> 01:41:34,345
There's a bomb on its way
to your offices. Get everybody out!

1111
01:41:34,421 --> 01:41:36,616
- What's going on?
- <i>It's in a white van.</i>

1112
01:41:36,690 --> 01:41:39,022
A Liberty Delivery Van.
Grant's in there.

1113
01:41:41,595 --> 01:41:43,529
They want the FBI this time!

1114
01:41:43,597 --> 01:41:45,963
Michael, you're breaking up!

1115
01:41:47,367 --> 01:41:49,733
Whit? Shit!

1116
01:41:54,508 --> 01:41:56,806
Come on!

1117
01:42:09,790 --> 01:42:11,485
Security, main gate.

1118
01:43:03,544 --> 01:43:05,273
Out of the way!

1119
01:43:57,097 --> 01:43:59,361
That's the van!

1120
01:43:59,433 --> 01:44:01,924
Stop it!

1121
01:44:06,173 --> 01:44:08,903
- Stop the van!
- Sir, step out of the vehicle!

1122
01:44:08,976 --> 01:44:12,742
- There's a bomb in the van!
- Step out of the vehicle!

1123
01:44:12,813 --> 01:44:15,281
- It's got a goddamn bomb!
- Michael, wait!

1124
01:44:15,349 --> 01:44:18,512
That's the van!
There's a bomb in there!

1125
01:44:18,585 --> 01:44:21,611
- That van was authorized.
- That's the van! Grant's inside!

1126
01:44:21,688 --> 01:44:24,122
It's the noon delivery.

1127
01:44:26,360 --> 01:44:28,624
Grant's in there!
It's got a goddamn bomb!

1128
01:44:38,338 --> 01:44:39,805
Hold your fire!

1129
01:44:55,422 --> 01:44:58,914
- Don't shoot!
- In the van!

1130
01:45:02,629 --> 01:45:06,258
Get everyone out of the building!
There's a bomb in the van!

1131
01:45:12,639 --> 01:45:15,608
- Get him out of the building.
- Check the goddamn van.

1132
01:45:18,679 --> 01:45:21,147
We gotta get everybody out of here.
There's a bomb.

1133
01:45:21,214 --> 01:45:23,148
- It's in there.
- Easy.

1134
01:45:26,520 --> 01:45:27,987
Wait! That's...

1135
01:45:28,055 --> 01:45:30,819
That's not the man.

1136
01:45:30,891 --> 01:45:33,257
- All right.
- Grant!

1137
01:45:34,795 --> 01:45:36,262
Let him go.

1138
01:45:36,330 --> 01:45:38,594
I said, let him go!

1139
01:45:39,599 --> 01:45:42,124
- Back off!
- The van's clean.

1140
01:45:42,202 --> 01:45:44,796
There's nothing in here.

1141
01:45:44,871 --> 01:45:47,806
Go ahead, Michael.

1142
01:46:00,954 --> 01:46:03,354
Michael, it's all clear.

1143
01:46:03,423 --> 01:46:06,290
The guy's authorized to be here.

1144
01:46:06,360 --> 01:46:10,524
We're all authorized to be here.
Everyone except you.

1145
01:46:13,734 --> 01:46:16,794
All right? Come on.

1146
01:46:22,142 --> 01:46:24,337
It's all right.

1147
01:46:39,793 --> 01:46:41,226
Hey, guys!

1148
01:47:00,514 --> 01:47:02,072
Stand by.

1149
01:47:38,618 --> 01:47:40,848
<i>Everyone except you.</i>

1150
01:47:53,533 --> 01:47:54,966
Boom.

1151
01:48:29,436 --> 01:48:32,269
<i>Right now, I'm sort of breathless.</i>

1152
01:48:32,339 --> 01:48:34,773
<i>I've just gotten here,</i>
<i>and there are people lying...</i>

1153
01:48:54,261 --> 01:48:56,729
<i>It looks just like a war zone!</i>

1154
01:49:09,876 --> 01:49:12,572
<i>Officials at this point believe</i>
<i>a bomb went off.</i>

1155
01:49:12,646 --> 01:49:15,206
<i>They're not sure</i>
<i>which floor, how big.</i>

1156
01:49:15,282 --> 01:49:19,844
<i>Obviously, it was massive</i>
<i>to create the kind of devastation...</i>

1157
01:49:54,220 --> 01:49:56,586
<i>Preliminary reports indicate</i>
<i>the bombing was the work...</i>

1158
01:49:56,656 --> 01:50:00,251
<i>of this man, Michael Faraday</i>
<i>of Reston, Virginia.</i>

1159
01:50:00,327 --> 01:50:03,421
<i>A professor of history</i>
<i>at George Washington University...</i>

1160
01:50:03,496 --> 01:50:07,296
<i>Officials will not confirm reports</i>
<i>that the bombing had anything to do....</i>

1161
01:50:07,367 --> 01:50:11,701
<i>with the death of Mr. Faraday's wife,</i>
<i>who had been an FBI agent.</i>

1162
01:50:19,412 --> 01:50:21,846
<i>Students and colleagues both say...</i>

1163
01:50:21,915 --> 01:50:26,409
<i>that Faraday's behavior was increasingly</i>
<i>erratic in the weeks leading</i> up...

1164
01:50:26,486 --> 01:50:30,047
<i>He was really intense, you know?</i>
<i>Knew all about these terrorists...</i>

1165
01:50:30,123 --> 01:50:32,250
<i>how they worked, what they wanted.</i>

1166
01:50:32,325 --> 01:50:35,158
<i>He was really into it.</i>
<i>It was my favorite class.</i>

1167
01:50:35,228 --> 01:50:38,288
<i>We went to this field trip once.</i>
<i>It was Copper Creek.</i>

1168
01:50:38,365 --> 01:50:42,529
<i>He practically broke down and started</i>
<i>crying, something about his wife.</i>

1169
01:50:42,602 --> 01:50:45,765
<i>We all sort of knew about it, but</i>
<i>he never really wanted to talk about it.</i>

1170
01:50:47,974 --> 01:50:51,603
<i>Faraday reportedly blamed the Bureau</i>
<i>for its role in his wife's death...</i>

1171
01:50:51,678 --> 01:50:53,270
<i>almost three years ago.</i>

1172
01:50:53,346 --> 01:50:55,439
<i>Specifically, sources</i>
<i>speculate his target....</i>

1173
01:50:55,515 --> 01:51:00,680
<i>may have been Agent Whit Carver, one of</i>
<i>the 184 people to perish in the attack.</i>

1174
01:51:00,754 --> 01:51:04,019
<i>Carver was a partner</i>
<i>of Faraday's wife at Copper Creek....</i>

1175
01:51:04,090 --> 01:51:06,251
<i>and Faraday</i>
<i>may have held him responsible.</i>

1176
01:51:06,326 --> 01:51:10,353
<i>All I know is what he told me</i>
<i>in his office one day after class.</i>

1177
01:51:10,430 --> 01:51:12,921
<i>I'll never forget that.</i>

1178
01:51:12,999 --> 01:51:16,162
<i>He said, "Sweetheart...</i>

1179
01:51:16,236 --> 01:51:19,433
<i>one day those men are going to pay.</i>

1180
01:51:19,506 --> 01:51:22,236
<i>One day those men</i>
<i>are going to burn. "

1181
01:51:32,852 --> 01:51:37,118
<i>Yet all of them described Faraday</i>
<i>as solitary but friendly...</i>

1182
01:51:37,190 --> 01:51:41,251
<i>as a talented professor fascinated</i>
<i>by the American underground...</i>

1183
01:51:41,327 --> 01:51:44,490
<i>and as a loving father</i>
<i>to his ten-year-old son....</i>

1184
01:51:44,564 --> 01:51:46,794
<i>who is now in the care of relatives.</i>

1185
01:51:53,206 --> 01:51:57,302
<i>And so after exhausting hundreds</i>
<i>of thousands of man-hours and leads....</i>

1186
01:51:57,377 --> 01:52:00,175
<i>federal Investigators are finally</i>
<i>ready to say....</i>

1187
01:52:00,246 --> 01:52:04,205
<i>that just as in the St. Louis</i>
<i>IRS bombing nearly two years ago...</i>

1188
01:52:04,284 --> 01:52:06,616
<i>this spring's attack on the FBI....</i>

1189
01:52:06,686 --> 01:52:09,177
<i>the worst terrorist strike</i>
<i>in our nation's history...</i>

1190
01:52:09,255 --> 01:52:12,315
<i>was the work of one man</i>
<i>and one man alone.</i>

1191
01:52:17,630 --> 01:52:19,621
Any news yet?

1192
01:52:19,699 --> 01:52:22,759
No. They'll let us know.

1193
01:52:26,039 --> 01:52:28,269
Someplace nice.

1194
01:52:28,341 --> 01:52:29,933
I hope.

1195
01:52:31,377 --> 01:52:32,969
Someplace safe.

1196
01:52:35,415 --> 01:52:37,007
Always.
