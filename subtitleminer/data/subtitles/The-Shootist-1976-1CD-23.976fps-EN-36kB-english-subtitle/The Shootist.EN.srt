1
00:00:47,341 --> 00:00:49,935
<i>His name was J.B. Books,</i>

2
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:52,604
<i>and he had
a matched pair of. 45s</i>

3
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,113
<i>with antique ivory grips</i>

4
00:00:54,181 --> 00:00:56,081
<i>that were something
to behold...</i>

5
00:00:57,852 --> 00:00:59,786
<i>but he wasn't
an outlaw.</i>

6
00:00:59,854 --> 00:01:01,515
<i>Fact is,
for a while,</i>

7
00:01:01,589 --> 00:01:02,886
<i>he was a lawman.</i>

8
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:09,855
<i>Long before I met Mr. Books,
he was a famous man.</i>

9
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,331
<i>I guess his fame was
why somebody or other</i>

10
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,890
<i>was always after him.</i>

11
00:01:17,705 --> 00:01:21,664
<i>The wild country
had taught him to survive.</i>

12
00:01:26,113 --> 00:01:27,808
Hyah!

13
00:01:27,882 --> 00:01:30,407
<i>He lived his life
and herded by himself.</i>

14
00:01:32,586 --> 00:01:34,918
<i>He had a credo
that went...</i>

15
00:01:34,989 --> 00:01:37,924
<i>I won't be
wronged. I won't be insulted.</i>

16
00:01:37,992 --> 00:01:40,426
<i>I won't be
laid a hand on.</i>

17
00:01:40,494 --> 00:01:42,928
<i>I don't do these things
to other people.</i>

18
00:01:42,997 --> 00:01:45,227
<i>I require
the same from them.</i>

19
00:03:06,947 --> 00:03:10,280
You hold it right there.

20
00:03:10,351 --> 00:03:11,909
Give me your wallet.

21
00:03:14,221 --> 00:03:17,452
Take it a little easy
with that cannon, mister.

22
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,121
Just throw me
your wallet.

23
00:03:22,196 --> 00:03:23,220
Yes, sir,

24
00:03:23,297 --> 00:03:25,128
and a little
something extra.

25
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:32,200
You done murdered me.

26
00:03:32,273 --> 00:03:33,706
No, but you're
going to have

27
00:03:33,774 --> 00:03:35,901
a long winter bellyache,
you boob.

28
00:03:35,976 --> 00:03:37,466
Give me that wallet.

29
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,949
Just the wallet.

30
00:03:45,019 --> 00:03:47,078
I can hardly move.

31
00:03:47,154 --> 00:03:50,214
You done shot a hole
in my stomach.

32
00:03:53,193 --> 00:03:54,626
I appreciate that.

33
00:03:54,695 --> 00:03:56,686
You ain't going
to leave me here.

34
00:03:56,764 --> 00:03:58,197
Well, it's quite obvious

35
00:03:58,265 --> 00:04:00,665
that's what you were
going to do to me.

36
00:04:00,734 --> 00:04:03,999
Get out of the way.

37
00:04:04,071 --> 00:04:06,869
Mister, you better find
yourself another line of work.

38
00:04:06,941 --> 00:04:10,138
This one sure don't
fit your pistol.

39
00:04:52,885 --> 00:04:55,285
Hey, mister,
want a paper?

40
00:04:55,354 --> 00:04:57,822
Yeah, I will, son.

41
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:59,380
Queen Victoria's dead.

42
00:05:03,329 --> 00:05:04,762
There you are.

43
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,058
Thank you.

44
00:05:18,411 --> 00:05:20,003
Whoa.

45
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:21,410
Hey!

46
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,380
Hey, you!

47
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:25,383
Hey, Methuselah,

48
00:05:25,451 --> 00:05:27,783
move that cack
out of the way.

49
00:05:27,853 --> 00:05:30,344
Are you
talking to me?

50
00:05:30,423 --> 00:05:32,516
Yeah, you dumb bastard.

51
00:05:32,592 --> 00:05:34,560
Move it, or I'll
deliver you something

52
00:05:34,627 --> 00:05:35,787
to remember me by.

53
00:05:35,861 --> 00:05:39,024
Well, now, pardon me
all to hell.

54
00:05:39,098 --> 00:05:40,190
Giddyup!

55
00:05:41,367 --> 00:05:42,800
Buster.

56
00:05:42,868 --> 00:05:43,800
Whoa.

57
00:05:43,869 --> 00:05:45,029
Try it.

58
00:05:48,774 --> 00:05:51,902
Come on, Jay, the old man
ain't worth the bullet.

59
00:05:51,978 --> 00:05:53,969
He looks
all tuckered out.

60
00:05:55,982 --> 00:05:57,779
Giddyup.

61
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,311
You're right there, son.

62
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,833
Doc Hostetler.

63
00:06:50,903 --> 00:06:53,303
John Bernard Books.

64
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:54,634
You remembered.

65
00:06:54,707 --> 00:06:57,301
The newspapers
occasionally remind me.

66
00:06:57,376 --> 00:06:59,810
Wh-What was it,
15 years ago?

67
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:02,245
The only time
I was ever hit...

68
00:07:02,314 --> 00:07:04,475
Right here
at the Acme Saloon.

69
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,983
You killed two men.

70
00:07:06,052 --> 00:07:08,486
I'm damn lucky
you were around.

71
00:07:08,554 --> 00:07:10,920
That second one
nearly did me in,

72
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:13,754
coming out of nowhere
like that.

73
00:07:13,826 --> 00:07:17,455
You must have the
constitution of an ox.

74
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:19,395
Well, we'll see.

75
00:07:19,465 --> 00:07:21,399
That's what
I'm here for.

76
00:07:21,467 --> 00:07:22,525
Oh?

77
00:07:26,338 --> 00:07:30,035
About 10 days ago
in Creede, Colorado,

78
00:07:30,109 --> 00:07:32,441
I hadn't been feeling
up to snuff,

79
00:07:32,511 --> 00:07:35,275
so I went to see
a sawbones there.

80
00:07:35,347 --> 00:07:36,439
He, uh...

81
00:07:36,515 --> 00:07:39,279
Well, the next day
I got on my horse

82
00:07:39,351 --> 00:07:41,581
and took off
to find you.

83
00:07:41,654 --> 00:07:45,647
And what did my
colleague in Creede say?

84
00:07:45,725 --> 00:07:48,216
Examine me,
and I'll tell you.

85
00:07:48,294 --> 00:07:49,921
You don't trust me.

86
00:07:49,995 --> 00:07:52,293
Oh, Doc,
you saved my life.

87
00:07:52,364 --> 00:07:54,093
You don't trust
my profession.

88
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:56,896
In my profession,
you trust too much,

89
00:07:56,969 --> 00:08:00,200
you don't celebrate
many birthdays.

90
00:08:00,272 --> 00:08:02,399
I kind of like it
around here.

91
00:08:04,877 --> 00:08:06,811
All right,
I'll examine you.

92
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,440
Take your clothes off
down to your long johns.

93
00:08:12,918 --> 00:08:14,351
Now, I, uh...

94
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:17,355
if I'm to know
what to look for,

95
00:08:17,423 --> 00:08:20,859
you'll have to tell me
what's ailing you.

96
00:08:20,926 --> 00:08:22,518
Well, I hurt, Doc,

97
00:08:22,595 --> 00:08:25,564
way down deep
in my back.

98
00:08:25,631 --> 00:08:27,064
Not all the time,

99
00:08:27,133 --> 00:08:29,499
but now and then
suddenly.

100
00:08:29,568 --> 00:08:32,366
Pain in the lumbar
vertebrae?

101
00:08:32,438 --> 00:08:33,996
Like sin.

102
00:08:34,073 --> 00:08:36,871
All right, whenever
you get ready,

103
00:08:36,942 --> 00:08:40,878
just... bend over
the table there,

104
00:08:40,946 --> 00:08:42,436
trapdoor down.

105
00:09:09,909 --> 00:09:11,001
Well?

106
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:15,336
Books, every few days

107
00:09:15,414 --> 00:09:17,348
I have to tell a man
or a woman

108
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:19,350
something
I don't want to.

109
00:09:19,418 --> 00:09:21,852
I've been practicing
medicine for 29 years,

110
00:09:21,921 --> 00:09:25,357
and I still don't know
how to do it well.

111
00:09:25,424 --> 00:09:28,416
Why don't you just
say it flat out?

112
00:09:28,494 --> 00:09:31,088
All right.

113
00:09:31,163 --> 00:09:33,063
You have a cancer...

114
00:09:33,132 --> 00:09:35,100
advanced.

115
00:09:42,608 --> 00:09:46,704
Is that what that fella
up at Creede told you?

116
00:09:46,779 --> 00:09:48,076
Yeah.

117
00:09:48,147 --> 00:09:50,945
And you didn't
believe him.

118
00:09:51,016 --> 00:09:53,382
No.

119
00:09:53,452 --> 00:09:55,386
Do you believe me?

120
00:09:55,454 --> 00:09:57,888
Can't you
cut it out, Doc?

121
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:02,393
I'd have to gut you
like a fish.

122
00:10:03,929 --> 00:10:06,864
Well, what can you do?

123
00:10:09,468 --> 00:10:12,403
There's...
just, uh...

124
00:10:12,471 --> 00:10:14,996
very little
I can do.

125
00:10:17,276 --> 00:10:20,074
Uh, if... when
the pain gets too bad,

126
00:10:20,145 --> 00:10:22,010
I can give you
something.

127
00:10:24,283 --> 00:10:26,683
What you're trying
to tell me

128
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:28,242
is that I...

129
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,311
Yeah.

130
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:34,592
Damn.

131
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:37,220
I'm sorry, Books.

132
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,897
You told me I was
strong as an ox.

133
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:47,438
Well, even an ox dies.

134
00:10:50,843 --> 00:10:53,368
How much time
do I have?

135
00:10:54,513 --> 00:10:58,779
Two months...
six weeks... less.

136
00:10:58,851 --> 00:11:00,716
There's no way
to tell.

137
00:11:02,388 --> 00:11:05,050
Well, what can I...

138
00:11:05,124 --> 00:11:07,786
What will I
be able to do?

139
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,886
Oh, anything
you want at first.

140
00:11:10,963 --> 00:11:14,057
Then, later on,
you won't want to.

141
00:11:16,302 --> 00:11:17,894
How much later?

142
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,403
You'll know when.

143
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:21,769
You'll have to
get off your feet

144
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,161
and get some rest.

145
00:11:23,294 --> 00:11:26,092
Have you made any kind of
arrangements for a room?

146
00:11:26,164 --> 00:11:28,860
No. I just
got in town.

147
00:11:28,933 --> 00:11:31,367
You might try
the widow Rogers.

148
00:11:31,436 --> 00:11:34,303
She's got a place down
the street a fair piece.

149
00:11:34,372 --> 00:11:35,805
She takes in lodgers.

150
00:11:35,874 --> 00:11:37,307
She's a nice woman.

151
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:38,774
She needs the help.

152
00:11:38,843 --> 00:11:40,777
I'll give it a try.

153
00:11:40,845 --> 00:11:42,278
Do me a favor.

154
00:11:42,347 --> 00:11:44,679
Don't tell anybody
I'm in town.

155
00:11:44,749 --> 00:11:48,310
Oh, no, but if I wanted
to go unnoticed,

156
00:11:48,386 --> 00:11:51,719
I don't think I'd walk
around with this thing.

157
00:11:54,659 --> 00:11:57,492
Stole it from
a whorehouse in Creede.

158
00:11:57,562 --> 00:11:58,494
Did you?

159
00:12:16,614 --> 00:12:19,082
Hello.

160
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:21,812
This the Rogers place?

161
00:12:21,886 --> 00:12:24,787
Yeah.

162
00:12:24,856 --> 00:12:25,948
Ma!

163
00:12:27,191 --> 00:12:29,125
You can tell
your mother

164
00:12:29,193 --> 00:12:32,458
that a tuckered-out
old man needs a room.

165
00:12:37,368 --> 00:12:38,426
Good afternoon, sir.

166
00:12:38,503 --> 00:12:40,334
Afternoon.

167
00:12:40,405 --> 00:12:45,104
Doc Hostetler says you
might be able to help me.

168
00:12:45,176 --> 00:12:46,609
How kind of him.

169
00:12:46,678 --> 00:12:48,908
Yes, sir, I have
one room available.

170
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,208
Good.

171
00:12:54,886 --> 00:12:56,319
Downstairs
in the rear.

172
00:12:56,387 --> 00:12:57,786
$8.00 by the week.

173
00:12:57,855 --> 00:13:00,255
$2.00 per day if
you're not permanent.

174
00:13:00,325 --> 00:13:02,259
Well, I'm not
permanent, ma'am.

175
00:13:02,327 --> 00:13:05,763
Oh, boy, get my gear and
the saddlebags off that horse

176
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:08,196
and bring them
into the house.

177
00:13:09,734 --> 00:13:13,397
Gillom will be happy
to do that.

178
00:13:23,681 --> 00:13:26,115
The parlor
is yours to use

179
00:13:26,184 --> 00:13:27,617
and the telephone.

180
00:13:27,685 --> 00:13:29,778
My other lodgers
have rooms upstairs.

181
00:13:29,854 --> 00:13:32,118
Two railroad men
and a schoolteacher.

182
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:35,284
I'll introduce them
at supper.

183
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,952
My kitchen.

184
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:41,293
And the bathroom.

185
00:13:41,366 --> 00:13:43,800
I thought
that's what it was.

186
00:13:43,868 --> 00:13:46,302
We do have
running water,

187
00:13:46,371 --> 00:13:49,306
also in the washbowl
in here.

188
00:13:50,608 --> 00:13:51,973
Nice-looking brass bed.

189
00:13:52,043 --> 00:13:54,477
I hope it hasn't
got any, uh...

190
00:13:54,545 --> 00:13:56,308
It isn't ticky, is it?

191
00:13:56,381 --> 00:13:59,316
It certainly is not.

192
00:13:59,384 --> 00:14:00,749
This is very comfortable.

193
00:14:00,818 --> 00:14:03,082
I'll take my meals
right here.

194
00:14:03,154 --> 00:14:05,247
I serve
in the dining room.

195
00:14:05,323 --> 00:14:06,881
I'll pay you extra.

196
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:10,394
Very well, since
you're not permanent.

197
00:14:10,461 --> 00:14:13,897
This suit's got a lot
of countryside on it.

198
00:14:13,965 --> 00:14:16,729
I'd like to have it
brushed before morning.

199
00:14:18,002 --> 00:14:21,267
I'll take
those saddlebags.

200
00:14:21,339 --> 00:14:23,773
That bedroll you can
leave outside.

201
00:14:23,841 --> 00:14:26,275
I have my things
wrapped in it.

202
00:14:26,344 --> 00:14:28,278
They'll need
soap and water.

203
00:14:28,346 --> 00:14:29,779
Have you a barn?

204
00:14:29,847 --> 00:14:31,280
No, we don't.

205
00:14:31,349 --> 00:14:33,442
Boy, take my horse over...

206
00:14:33,518 --> 00:14:35,884
My name's Gillom.
It's not "boy. "

207
00:14:35,953 --> 00:14:37,386
It's Gillom Rogers,

208
00:14:37,455 --> 00:14:40,549
and I don't like
being ordered around.

209
00:14:43,761 --> 00:14:47,288
Well, that's fair enough,
Gillom Rogers.

210
00:14:47,365 --> 00:14:51,131
Would you be so kind
as to take Old Dollar

211
00:14:51,202 --> 00:14:52,794
over to
the livery stable

212
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:56,306
and see that he gets
a double order of oats?

213
00:14:58,209 --> 00:14:59,301
O.K.

214
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:07,418
You seem to be a man

215
00:15:07,485 --> 00:15:09,248
accustomed
to giving orders.

216
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,720
I guess it is
a bad habit of mine.

217
00:15:11,789 --> 00:15:13,586
I didn't
get your name.

218
00:15:13,658 --> 00:15:15,751
I didn't give it.

219
00:15:15,827 --> 00:15:17,488
Is it so important?

220
00:15:17,562 --> 00:15:20,497
For anyone living under
my roof, it is.

221
00:15:20,565 --> 00:15:21,998
Well, all right.

222
00:15:22,066 --> 00:15:25,263
It's, uh... Hickok,

223
00:15:25,336 --> 00:15:27,270
William Hickok.

224
00:15:27,338 --> 00:15:30,273
Where do you hail from,
Mr. Hickok?

225
00:15:30,341 --> 00:15:31,774
Abilene, Kansas.

226
00:15:31,843 --> 00:15:34,277
And what
do you do there?

227
00:15:34,345 --> 00:15:36,609
I'm a U.S. Marshal.

228
00:15:36,681 --> 00:15:38,114
Oh, that's nice.

229
00:15:38,182 --> 00:15:39,774
No, it isn't.

230
00:15:39,851 --> 00:15:42,786
I'm glad you're not
staying long, Mr. Hickok.

231
00:15:42,854 --> 00:15:45,118
I'm not sure
I like you.

232
00:15:45,189 --> 00:15:47,157
Not many do,
Mrs. Rogers.

233
00:15:59,871 --> 00:16:03,739
Moses, where did you hide
the whiskey this time?

234
00:16:03,808 --> 00:16:06,402
Third drawer from
the left, Gilly boy.

235
00:16:20,324 --> 00:16:22,656
Gilly, fetch me
my spectacles.

236
00:16:38,342 --> 00:16:40,276
What the hell
are you doing?

237
00:16:40,344 --> 00:16:42,369
You watch
your language, boy.

238
00:16:59,997 --> 00:17:04,866
J.B. Books is
in my house.

239
00:17:04,936 --> 00:17:06,403
Hey.

240
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:09,268
My name is Books.

241
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,773
Y'all get that?

242
00:17:11,843 --> 00:17:20,048
Bang!

243
00:17:20,117 --> 00:17:21,379
Boom!

244
00:17:21,452 --> 00:17:23,647
He's in my house.

245
00:17:28,659 --> 00:17:30,854
Ma!

246
00:17:30,928 --> 00:17:33,260
Ma, I got to
tell you something.

247
00:17:33,331 --> 00:17:34,764
Shh. Close the door.

248
00:17:34,832 --> 00:17:35,924
What's happened?

249
00:17:38,002 --> 00:17:39,435
Who do you think...

250
00:17:39,503 --> 00:17:41,937
Oh, Gillom, you've
been drinking again.

251
00:17:42,006 --> 00:17:44,270
Do you know
who he is?

252
00:17:44,342 --> 00:17:45,502
William Hickok...

253
00:17:45,576 --> 00:17:48,807
United States Marshal
in Abilene, Kansas.

254
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,780
Ma,
Wild Bill Hickok

255
00:17:50,848 --> 00:17:53,783
was shot
before I was born.

256
00:17:55,219 --> 00:17:57,881
We got
J.B. Books here.

257
00:17:57,955 --> 00:18:00,082
He's killed 30 men.

258
00:18:01,959 --> 00:18:03,756
Gillom, go to your room.

259
00:18:03,828 --> 00:18:07,229
Go on. Go to bed before
you wake the house.

260
00:18:07,298 --> 00:18:08,731
Good night, Ma.

261
00:18:10,301 --> 00:18:11,563
Whoo.

262
00:18:18,209 --> 00:18:19,471
Come in.

263
00:18:21,145 --> 00:18:22,237
Mr. Books?

264
00:18:22,313 --> 00:18:23,746
Oh, my clothes.

265
00:18:23,814 --> 00:18:26,305
Thank you, m...

266
00:18:26,384 --> 00:18:28,944
You are J.B. Books.

267
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:31,386
That's right.

268
00:18:33,324 --> 00:18:36,088
May I ask
how you found out?

269
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,092
My son.

270
00:18:37,161 --> 00:18:39,095
I've been up all night
because of you.

271
00:18:39,163 --> 00:18:41,757
I demand that you
pack and leave.

272
00:18:41,832 --> 00:18:44,266
That is not possible.

273
00:18:44,335 --> 00:18:45,825
And why not?

274
00:18:47,338 --> 00:18:49,966
I don't
propose to say.

275
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:51,508
So you won't go.

276
00:18:51,575 --> 00:18:52,974
No.

277
00:18:53,044 --> 00:18:54,679
And that's
your last word?

278
00:18:54,812 --> 00:18:57,144
Mrs. Rogers,
you have a fine color

279
00:18:57,215 --> 00:19:00,207
when you're
on the scrap.

280
00:19:12,163 --> 00:19:15,599
Central, give me
the city marshal's office.

281
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:17,691
Thank you.

282
00:19:29,514 --> 00:19:31,277
Come in, Marshal.

283
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:41,419
My name's Thibido,

284
00:19:41,492 --> 00:19:43,119
Marshal
Walter Thibido.

285
00:19:43,194 --> 00:19:46,925
I'm told...
you are J.B. Books.

286
00:19:46,998 --> 00:19:48,465
You were told right.

287
00:19:48,533 --> 00:19:49,966
Have a seat.

288
00:19:50,034 --> 00:19:51,433
Don't think I will.

289
00:19:51,502 --> 00:19:53,936
Breathe easy, Marshal.

290
00:19:54,005 --> 00:19:56,940
You're closer to your gun
than I am to mine.

291
00:19:57,008 --> 00:20:00,136
Books, Carson City's
full of hard cases...

292
00:20:00,211 --> 00:20:01,974
Is your head cold?

293
00:20:02,046 --> 00:20:03,138
Huh?

294
00:20:03,214 --> 00:20:04,306
Oh.

295
00:20:04,382 --> 00:20:06,816
Books, Carson City's
full of hard cases

296
00:20:06,884 --> 00:20:09,819
who'd sell their souls to
put your name on the wall.

297
00:20:09,887 --> 00:20:13,288
You'll draw trouble like
an outhouse draws flies.

298
00:20:13,357 --> 00:20:15,655
I checked my bulletins
before I come over

299
00:20:15,726 --> 00:20:18,456
and didn't find nothing
I can hold you for,

300
00:20:18,529 --> 00:20:20,656
but I want you
out of town...

301
00:20:20,731 --> 00:20:22,164
directly, today.

302
00:20:22,233 --> 00:20:24,667
Maybe I'm not
so inclined.

303
00:20:24,735 --> 00:20:27,431
Then, by God,
I will incline you.

304
00:20:27,505 --> 00:20:30,497
I can badge
as many men as I need.

305
00:20:30,575 --> 00:20:33,510
We'll smoke you out or
carry you out feet first,

306
00:20:33,578 --> 00:20:36,172
so you say which,
Mr. Gunman.

307
00:20:36,247 --> 00:20:38,181
It's your funeral.

308
00:20:38,249 --> 00:20:39,443
Soon, yes.

309
00:20:39,517 --> 00:20:40,677
Huh?

310
00:20:40,751 --> 00:20:42,184
I can't go.

311
00:20:42,253 --> 00:20:43,447
Can't?

312
00:20:43,521 --> 00:20:46,718
I'm going to die
right here in this room.

313
00:20:48,259 --> 00:20:51,126
Ha! That's too thin.

314
00:20:51,195 --> 00:20:53,186
I wish you were right.

315
00:20:53,264 --> 00:20:55,698
Would you believe
Doc Hostetler?

316
00:20:55,766 --> 00:20:57,324
That's his verdict.

317
00:21:00,705 --> 00:21:02,138
You don't say?

318
00:21:02,206 --> 00:21:04,401
You don't sa...
goddamn!

319
00:21:04,475 --> 00:21:05,601
Whoo!

320
00:21:05,676 --> 00:21:07,507
Whooee!

321
00:21:07,578 --> 00:21:09,409
I tell you
the truth...

322
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,643
Coming through that door,
I was scared.

323
00:21:12,717 --> 00:21:16,312
I know what a man
like you is capable of.

324
00:21:16,387 --> 00:21:18,651
I wondered
who'd get my job,

325
00:21:18,723 --> 00:21:21,658
if the council would give
my wife a pension,

326
00:21:21,726 --> 00:21:24,661
and if it would snow
the day they put me under.

327
00:21:24,729 --> 00:21:27,857
Excuse me if I don't
pull a long face.

328
00:21:27,932 --> 00:21:29,160
You talk too much.

329
00:21:29,233 --> 00:21:31,167
Much as I damn please.

330
00:21:31,235 --> 00:21:33,669
How long does
Hostetler give you?

331
00:21:33,738 --> 00:21:35,706
He doesn't know.
Do me a favor.

332
00:21:35,773 --> 00:21:38,003
I owe you one...
or Hostetler.

333
00:21:38,075 --> 00:21:41,169
My being here...
maybe that's news,

334
00:21:41,245 --> 00:21:43,679
but dying
is my own business.

335
00:21:43,748 --> 00:21:46,683
Keep it under your hat,
will you?

336
00:21:46,751 --> 00:21:49,948
Just don't take
too long to die.

337
00:21:50,021 --> 00:21:52,956
Be a gent and
convenience everybody

338
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:54,924
and do it soon.

339
00:21:57,662 --> 00:21:59,527
You've worn out
your welcome.

340
00:21:59,597 --> 00:22:00,529
Scat.

341
00:22:05,703 --> 00:22:07,967
The day they
lay you away,

342
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:10,303
what I'll do
on your grave

343
00:22:10,374 --> 00:22:11,807
won't pass
for flowers.

344
00:22:31,028 --> 00:22:32,461
You damn little sneak.

345
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:34,760
How long
were you there?

346
00:22:34,832 --> 00:22:36,766
I was just
passing by.

347
00:22:36,834 --> 00:22:38,301
You spy on me,

348
00:22:38,369 --> 00:22:40,667
and I'll nail you
to a tree.

349
00:22:40,738 --> 00:22:42,171
You've told your mother.

350
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,174
Who else have you
blabbed to?

351
00:22:44,242 --> 00:22:45,573
Jay Cobb.

352
00:22:45,643 --> 00:22:47,838
Are you all right,
Mr. Books?

353
00:22:47,912 --> 00:22:49,675
I can't abide
a skulker.

354
00:22:49,747 --> 00:22:52,272
You want to see me,

355
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:55,285
knock on my door
like a man.

356
00:22:55,353 --> 00:22:56,684
Sure you're all right?

357
00:22:56,754 --> 00:22:58,051
If there's anything

358
00:22:58,122 --> 00:22:59,749
I can do for you,
just let me know.

359
00:22:59,824 --> 00:23:02,622
It's an honor to have you
in this house.

360
00:23:02,693 --> 00:23:04,126
Your mother
doesn't agree.

361
00:23:04,195 --> 00:23:07,255
She doesn't know
how a man feels.

362
00:23:07,331 --> 00:23:10,129
You're the most famous person
ever in this town.

363
00:23:10,201 --> 00:23:12,135
When I was a boy,

364
00:23:12,203 --> 00:23:15,138
I heard about your shootout
at the Acme Saloon.

365
00:23:15,206 --> 00:23:17,470
I never thought
I'd meet you.

366
00:23:17,541 --> 00:23:19,805
There's more
to being a man

367
00:23:19,877 --> 00:23:21,310
than handling a gun.

368
00:23:21,379 --> 00:23:24,041
Don't you have
something to do?

369
00:23:24,115 --> 00:23:28,051
I was just headed over to
Cobb's Creamery right now.

370
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:30,553
I help Jay with
deliveries sometimes.

371
00:23:30,621 --> 00:23:32,555
That was
the nice gentleman

372
00:23:32,623 --> 00:23:34,056
you were with
yesterday.

373
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:35,558
Where's your mother?

374
00:23:35,626 --> 00:23:38,060
She's in the kitchen,
I think.

375
00:23:38,129 --> 00:23:39,653
Well, goodbye, sir.

376
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:42,164
It was real nice
meeting you.

377
00:23:42,233 --> 00:23:43,325
Good-bye.

378
00:24:01,652 --> 00:24:05,986
Mrs. Rogers, I, uh...
hope you'll forgive me

379
00:24:06,057 --> 00:24:08,617
for taking Hickok's name.

380
00:24:08,693 --> 00:24:12,129
I thought it was
pretty funny at the time,

381
00:24:12,196 --> 00:24:15,996
but after reflection...

382
00:24:16,067 --> 00:24:19,127
it wasn't such a joke,
and I apologize.

383
00:24:19,203 --> 00:24:20,295
You should.

384
00:24:20,371 --> 00:24:23,135
The only way you can
show your repentance

385
00:24:23,207 --> 00:24:24,640
is to leave.

386
00:24:24,709 --> 00:24:27,542
Well, that
I cannot do.

387
00:24:27,611 --> 00:24:31,047
Mr. Books, you are
a notorious individual

388
00:24:31,115 --> 00:24:33,549
utterly lacking
in character or decency.

389
00:24:33,617 --> 00:24:35,050
You're an assassin.

390
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:38,054
That's according to which end
of the gun you're on.

391
00:24:38,122 --> 00:24:40,556
You lied to me,
made a fool of me.

392
00:24:40,624 --> 00:24:42,558
This house
is all I have.

393
00:24:42,626 --> 00:24:44,560
If my lodgers
find out who you are,

394
00:24:44,628 --> 00:24:45,652
they'll leave.

395
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:47,163
I have a cancer.

396
00:24:50,234 --> 00:24:51,826
I'm dying of it.

397
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,674
I know what
you'll be thinking...

398
00:24:58,743 --> 00:25:01,610
That I'll be
a lot of trouble.

399
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,112
Well, I won't.

400
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:05,614
You just
bring me my meals,

401
00:25:05,683 --> 00:25:08,618
and I'll see
to the other needs.

402
00:25:08,686 --> 00:25:11,587
I promise you
I won't be a burden.

403
00:25:15,426 --> 00:25:18,862
Mrs. Rogers, I'm
in a kind of a tight...

404
00:25:18,929 --> 00:25:21,124
I'll make it
worth your while.

405
00:25:21,198 --> 00:25:24,258
I can pay $4.00 a day
for the room.

406
00:26:00,671 --> 00:26:01,763
Oh, Mr. Books.

407
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:04,603
Most pleased to meet you,
sir, and honored.

408
00:26:04,675 --> 00:26:07,610
What did you want
to see me about?

409
00:26:07,678 --> 00:26:09,111
The name is Dan Dobkins.

410
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:11,114
<i>I'm with
The Morning Appeal.</i>

411
00:26:11,182 --> 00:26:12,615
Mr. Dobkins,
sit down.

412
00:26:12,683 --> 00:26:13,615
Thank you.

413
00:26:13,684 --> 00:26:14,616
Um...

414
00:26:14,685 --> 00:26:16,619
we ran the story
this morning

415
00:26:16,687 --> 00:26:19,121
that you were here
at Mrs. Rogers'

416
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:21,124
and enjoying our
salubrious winter climate

417
00:26:21,192 --> 00:26:23,126
and so on and so forth.

418
00:26:23,194 --> 00:26:24,286
Have you seen it?

419
00:26:24,361 --> 00:26:26,160
No.

420
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:27,521
It's page one,
I assure you.

421
00:26:27,595 --> 00:26:30,029
I bought your paper
when I arrived.

422
00:26:30,097 --> 00:26:32,429
Still reading about
Queen Victoria dying.

423
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,432
Oh.

424
00:26:33,501 --> 00:26:35,935
What can I do for you?

425
00:26:36,003 --> 00:26:37,766
That's what
I came to discuss.

426
00:26:37,838 --> 00:26:39,396
Well, that's
what I figured.

427
00:26:39,473 --> 00:26:40,770
You must
appreciate, sir,

428
00:26:40,841 --> 00:26:43,810
that you are the most
celebrated shootist extant.

429
00:26:43,878 --> 00:26:45,368
Extant?

430
00:26:45,446 --> 00:26:47,539
Uh, still existing,

431
00:26:47,615 --> 00:26:48,673
alive.

432
00:26:48,749 --> 00:26:49,716
Thank you.

433
00:26:49,783 --> 00:26:52,047
Yes, and your reputation
is nationwide.

434
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:55,054
My story went out over
the wires this morning.

435
00:26:55,122 --> 00:26:57,556
Every daily of consequence
will run it,

436
00:26:57,625 --> 00:26:58,717
but they'll want more,

437
00:26:58,792 --> 00:27:00,987
the papers in
the East, in particular.

438
00:27:01,061 --> 00:27:02,494
Between us, Mr. Books,

439
00:27:02,563 --> 00:27:06,624
we can really put
Carson City on the map.

440
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:10,431
Mr. Dobkins, you're going
the long way around the barn.

441
00:27:10,504 --> 00:27:11,493
Yes, sir.

442
00:27:11,572 --> 00:27:13,005
I would
like tremendously

443
00:27:13,073 --> 00:27:15,132
to do a series
of stories on you.

444
00:27:15,209 --> 00:27:16,141
A series?

445
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:19,236
Yes. Uh, how long
will you be with us?

446
00:27:19,313 --> 00:27:23,147
Not as long
as I'd like to be.

447
00:27:23,217 --> 00:27:26,152
Oh, well, we could
start today, right now,

448
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,051
then get together
again tomorrow.

449
00:27:28,122 --> 00:27:29,214
You see,

450
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:31,850
there's been so much
cheap fiction about gunmen.

451
00:27:31,926 --> 00:27:35,020
I want to get down to
the true story for once,

452
00:27:35,095 --> 00:27:36,562
while you're available,

453
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:39,326
before anything
happens to you.

454
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,425
I mean,
I hope nothing does.

455
00:27:41,502 --> 00:27:42,799
Go on.

456
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:46,328
I want to cover
your career factually.

457
00:27:46,407 --> 00:27:48,432
The statistics,
you might say.

458
00:27:48,509 --> 00:27:51,034
Then I'd delve into the
psychological aspects...

459
00:27:51,111 --> 00:27:54,547
What turned you to violence
in the first place?

460
00:27:54,615 --> 00:27:57,584
Are you by nature
bloodthirsty?

461
00:27:57,651 --> 00:28:01,519
Uh, do you, uh, brood
after the deed is done,

462
00:28:01,589 --> 00:28:03,989
or have you lived
so long with death

463
00:28:04,058 --> 00:28:06,993
that you're used to it?
The death of others?

464
00:28:07,061 --> 00:28:08,995
The prospect
of your own?

465
00:28:09,063 --> 00:28:10,997
Make like
that's a nipple.

466
00:28:11,065 --> 00:28:12,498
One fit or fidget

467
00:28:12,566 --> 00:28:16,002
and Mrs. Rogers is going
to be scrubbing your brains

468
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,503
off the wallpaper.

469
00:28:17,571 --> 00:28:19,004
On your feet.

470
00:28:19,073 --> 00:28:20,005
Back up.

471
00:28:20,074 --> 00:28:23,009
Now, we're heading
for the front door.

472
00:28:23,077 --> 00:28:26,012
Now, don't you shake,
shiver, or sneeze.

473
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,015
Mr. Books, what in heaven's
name are you doing?

474
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:31,517
Ma'am, we have
a touchy situation here.

475
00:28:31,585 --> 00:28:32,677
Out.

476
00:28:37,091 --> 00:28:38,023
Turn around.

477
00:28:38,092 --> 00:28:39,024
Mmm.

478
00:28:39,093 --> 00:28:40,025
Turn around.

479
00:28:40,094 --> 00:28:41,527
Bend over.

480
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:42,687
Yes, sir.

481
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:46,529
Dobkins, you are a prying,
pipsqueaking ass,

482
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,900
and if you ever come
dandying around here again...

483
00:28:58,379 --> 00:29:00,870
That was
a savage thing to do.

484
00:29:00,948 --> 00:29:01,880
Maybe...

485
00:29:05,352 --> 00:29:06,341
Mr. Books?

486
00:29:07,821 --> 00:29:10,221
I'll tend myself.

487
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:15,993
First things first, Doc.

488
00:29:16,063 --> 00:29:17,997
I almost forgot
to ask you.

489
00:29:18,065 --> 00:29:20,499
How much do I owe you?

490
00:29:20,567 --> 00:29:23,502
You're a man after
my own heart, Books.

491
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:27,006
Most of them ask
that last, if at all.

492
00:29:27,074 --> 00:29:28,507
Well, let's see.

493
00:29:28,575 --> 00:29:31,510
We'll make it $4.00
for the two visits

494
00:29:31,578 --> 00:29:34,513
plus $ 1.00 for that.

495
00:29:34,581 --> 00:29:36,014
What's that?

496
00:29:36,083 --> 00:29:37,516
They call that laudanum,

497
00:29:37,584 --> 00:29:42,021
a solution of opium
and alcohol.

498
00:29:42,089 --> 00:29:45,388
Opium, that can
get to be a habit.

499
00:29:45,459 --> 00:29:48,053
Why, absolutely,
an addiction.

500
00:29:48,128 --> 00:29:50,619
How does it taste?

501
00:29:50,698 --> 00:29:53,098
Just... just awful,
terrible,

502
00:29:53,167 --> 00:29:57,126
but it's the most potent
painkiller we've got.

503
00:29:57,204 --> 00:30:00,105
How much of it
do I take?

504
00:30:00,174 --> 00:30:04,042
Well, as much as you need
when you need it.

505
00:30:04,111 --> 00:30:05,544
I think a spoonful

506
00:30:05,612 --> 00:30:08,046
would be all right
to start with.

507
00:30:08,115 --> 00:30:09,104
Later?

508
00:30:09,183 --> 00:30:10,377
I don't know,

509
00:30:10,451 --> 00:30:12,043
but I... I
think one morning

510
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:15,054
you're just going
to wake up and say,

511
00:30:15,122 --> 00:30:20,059
"Here I am in this bed,
and here I'm going to stay. "

512
00:30:21,628 --> 00:30:23,926
Hostetler,
I want to know.

513
00:30:23,997 --> 00:30:26,056
Well, unless you insist,

514
00:30:26,133 --> 00:30:28,624
I'd rather not talk
about it.

515
00:30:30,137 --> 00:30:33,903
Well, I want to know.

516
00:30:33,974 --> 00:30:35,066
All right.

517
00:30:35,142 --> 00:30:36,575
There'll be an increase

518
00:30:36,643 --> 00:30:39,077
in the severity
of the pain

519
00:30:39,146 --> 00:30:43,674
in your lower spine,
your hips, your groin.

520
00:30:43,751 --> 00:30:45,082
You...

521
00:30:45,152 --> 00:30:48,815
Do you... Do you
want me to go on?

522
00:30:51,658 --> 00:30:54,092
The pain will
become unbearable.

523
00:30:54,161 --> 00:30:56,652
Uh, no drug
will moderate it.

524
00:30:56,730 --> 00:31:00,325
If you're lucky,
you'll lose consciousness,

525
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,334
and until then,
you'll scream.

526
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:13,041
L- I... I'm sorry.

527
00:31:13,113 --> 00:31:16,549
L... I didn't mean
to be specific like this.

528
00:31:16,617 --> 00:31:19,051
The next time,
I'll go to Mrs. Rogers.

529
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:21,053
You... You...
You just telephone.

530
00:31:21,121 --> 00:31:22,884
You just telephone.

531
00:31:24,124 --> 00:31:28,356
There... There's
one more thing I'd say.

532
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:34,067
Both of us have had
a lot to do with death.

533
00:31:34,134 --> 00:31:37,501
I'm not a brave man,
but you must be.

534
00:31:37,571 --> 00:31:38,560
Ah.

535
00:31:38,639 --> 00:31:41,574
Now-now-now,
this is not advice.

536
00:31:41,642 --> 00:31:43,576
It's not
even a suggestion.

537
00:31:43,644 --> 00:31:46,374
It's just something
for you to reflect on

538
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:48,573
while your mind's
still clear.

539
00:31:48,649 --> 00:31:49,980
What?

540
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:54,680
I would not die a death
like I just described.

541
00:31:54,755 --> 00:31:56,222
No?

542
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:59,350
Not if I
had your courage.

543
00:31:59,426 --> 00:32:00,984
Oh.

544
00:32:04,598 --> 00:32:05,963
Thanks.

545
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:31,274
Come in, Mrs. Rogers.

546
00:32:32,483 --> 00:32:33,575
Oh, Mr. Books, I...

547
00:32:33,651 --> 00:32:35,915
I'm beginning
to know your knock.

548
00:32:35,987 --> 00:32:38,114
I was reading
about old Queen Vic.

549
00:32:38,189 --> 00:32:41,955
Well, maybe she
outlived her time.

550
00:32:42,026 --> 00:32:44,460
Maybe she was
a museum piece,

551
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:46,963
but she never
lost her dignity

552
00:32:47,031 --> 00:32:48,623
nor sold her guns.

553
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:52,932
She hung on to her pride
and went out in style.

554
00:32:53,004 --> 00:32:56,405
That's the kind of
an old gal I'd like to meet.

555
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,965
Mrs. Rogers,
are you afraid of me?

556
00:32:59,043 --> 00:33:01,876
Well, to be frank, yes.

557
00:33:01,946 --> 00:33:03,004
Why?

558
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:06,847
All these guns and
the kind of man you are.

559
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:09,853
Maybe you're afraid
of too many things.

560
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:11,218
Sometimes widows are,

561
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:14,986
but I'm sure there's plenty
of starch in your corset.

562
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:19,325
Mr. Books, I came here
to see what you can eat,

563
00:33:19,397 --> 00:33:21,490
if you can have
what I'm serving.

564
00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:22,760
No, you didn't.

565
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:25,302
I wish you'd stop
contradicting me.

566
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:27,429
I wish you'd say
what you mean.

567
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:31,237
Very well.

568
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:34,107
I apologize for
the unchristian things

569
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:35,805
I've said and done.

570
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:39,816
I'm sorry, and I'll do
whatever I can for you.

571
00:33:40,985 --> 00:33:42,850
Well, thank you. I...

572
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:47,424
All my life,
I've been too proud

573
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:49,926
to take help
from anyone.

574
00:33:49,994 --> 00:33:51,985
Guess I'll
have to learn.

575
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:54,088
Would you, uh...

576
00:33:54,165 --> 00:33:56,929
sit down for a moment?

577
00:33:57,001 --> 00:33:58,059
Please do.

578
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:04,533
What's that?

579
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:06,406
Laudanum.

580
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:11,142
Doc Hostetler's remedy.

581
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:12,876
That's habit-forming,
isn't it?

582
00:34:16,754 --> 00:34:19,382
Mrs. Rogers, would
you go for a drive

583
00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:21,891
in the country
with me tomorrow?

584
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:24,325
Oh, I... I couldn't,
but thank you.

585
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:25,726
I wish you'd reconsider.

586
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:28,595
It would only be
for an hour or two.

587
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:30,896
No. I appreciate
the invitation, but no.

588
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:33,903
Is it that you don't want
to be alone with me?

589
00:34:33,971 --> 00:34:35,905
It's not that,
I assure you.

590
00:34:35,973 --> 00:34:39,534
It's just that I've only
been a widow for a year.

591
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:40,542
People would...

592
00:34:40,611 --> 00:34:41,635
People!

593
00:34:41,713 --> 00:34:44,045
If I have to work
on your sympathy, I will.

594
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:46,913
I want to go out
in the world again

595
00:34:46,984 --> 00:34:49,919
and see trees, lakes,
hills, and the sky.

596
00:34:49,987 --> 00:34:52,421
And I don't fancy
seeing it alone.

597
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:55,152
I've been full
of alone lately.

598
00:34:56,994 --> 00:34:58,086
I'm sorry.

599
00:34:58,162 --> 00:35:01,427
Besides, there's a threat
of snow in the air.

600
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:04,366
Since I moved in here,

601
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:06,869
we've been scratching
at each other

602
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,872
and apologizing.

603
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,773
Well, let's see
if we can't do better.

604
00:35:11,843 --> 00:35:16,212
Damn it. I wish to hell
you'd ride with me.

605
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,374
I apologize
for my language.

606
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,749
I'll go with you.

607
00:35:23,821 --> 00:35:25,550
Good.

608
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:27,056
Tomorrow at 10:00?

609
00:35:28,693 --> 00:35:31,423
Will you get, please,
Mr. Gillom Rogers

610
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:33,225
to trot down
to the stable

611
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:37,393
and get us the best horse
and buggy they have?

612
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:38,400
I will.

613
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:41,063
I'm much obliged, ma'am.

614
00:36:01,425 --> 00:36:02,517
Good evening.

615
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:33,223
Deuce is the dead card.

616
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:34,724
8 is your winner,

617
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:37,727
and the lovely queen,
the loser.

618
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:39,126
Hellfire!

619
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,392
That makes seven
turnovers in a row.

620
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:43,899
Pulford,J.B. Books
over at Mrs. Rogers.

621
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:45,230
That was
yesterday's news.

622
00:36:45,303 --> 00:36:47,328
But I just heard
he's dying.

623
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:49,463
Dying?

624
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,667
Friend of mine got it
from Marshal Thibido.

625
00:36:51,742 --> 00:36:54,643
Old Books is cashing in.

626
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,713
That's hard news.

627
00:36:57,782 --> 00:37:00,410
That's a man
I could have taken.

628
00:37:00,484 --> 00:37:01,416
Ha!

629
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:02,509
My ass.

630
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:03,815
You have two ways

631
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:06,550
of leaving this
establishment, my friend...

632
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:08,057
Immediately or dead.

633
00:37:19,937 --> 00:37:21,427
Gentlemen, place your bets.

634
00:37:21,505 --> 00:37:23,700
Place your bets,
gentlemen.

635
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:29,668
Look out!

636
00:37:57,975 --> 00:37:58,907
43...

637
00:37:58,976 --> 00:37:59,840
44...

638
00:37:59,911 --> 00:38:00,843
45...

639
00:38:00,912 --> 00:38:01,844
46...

640
00:38:01,913 --> 00:38:02,845
47... 48.

641
00:38:02,914 --> 00:38:04,347
Clean through
the heart!

642
00:38:04,415 --> 00:38:05,905
Hey, Pulford!

643
00:38:05,983 --> 00:38:08,178
Over 80 feet!

644
00:38:08,252 --> 00:38:09,913
- Hooray!
- Hooray!

645
00:38:17,428 --> 00:38:18,861
Oh, mighty handsome,
ma'am.

646
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:21,364
Moses had to dust
this buggy off.

647
00:38:21,432 --> 00:38:24,367
He says he don't
rent it too often.

648
00:38:24,435 --> 00:38:26,368
Doesn't.

649
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:27,927
Except just
for funerals.

650
00:38:29,006 --> 00:38:30,871
Well, thank you, Gillom.

651
00:38:30,942 --> 00:38:32,375
I appreciate this.

652
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:35,344
I want that wood chopped
by the time we get back.

653
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:37,881
Oh, Ma, I was
going to go on...

654
00:38:37,949 --> 00:38:38,881
Yes, ma'am.

655
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:39,882
Hyah.

656
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:12,348
That is beauty.

657
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:14,850
It is a little chilly
up here.

658
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:16,853
Would you like
the top raised?

659
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:18,183
No, thank you.

660
00:39:25,721 --> 00:39:27,154
You all right?

661
00:39:27,222 --> 00:39:29,588
I will be in a minute.

662
00:39:30,726 --> 00:39:32,159
Can I help you?

663
00:39:32,227 --> 00:39:34,923
I've had plenty
of practice.

664
00:39:45,407 --> 00:39:47,841
Why don't you
get married again?

665
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:49,343
What?

666
00:39:49,411 --> 00:39:51,345
I think you heard me.

667
00:39:51,413 --> 00:39:53,347
That's none
of your affair.

668
00:39:53,415 --> 00:39:56,350
I haven't time
to be polite, Mrs. Rogers.

669
00:39:56,418 --> 00:39:59,353
Well, for one thing,
I haven't been asked.

670
00:39:59,421 --> 00:40:01,855
For another,
I loved my husband

671
00:40:01,924 --> 00:40:03,516
and still do.

672
00:40:03,592 --> 00:40:05,116
How did he die?

673
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:06,354
Stroke, they think.

674
00:40:06,428 --> 00:40:09,363
They found him slumped
at his desk.

675
00:40:09,431 --> 00:40:10,864
He was lucky.

676
00:40:10,933 --> 00:40:12,366
He was 41.

677
00:40:12,434 --> 00:40:14,868
Did he have time
to, uh...

678
00:40:14,937 --> 00:40:17,303
Did he leave you
any security?

679
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:19,864
I have the property
and the house,

680
00:40:19,942 --> 00:40:22,069
which he built
with a bank loan,

681
00:40:22,144 --> 00:40:23,133
and Gillom.

682
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:24,873
And he worries you.

683
00:40:24,947 --> 00:40:26,380
Yeah, he certainly does,

684
00:40:26,448 --> 00:40:29,383
particularly when he
complains about being bored

685
00:40:29,451 --> 00:40:30,543
and needing excitement.

686
00:40:30,619 --> 00:40:33,383
Well, I wouldn't
be too hard on him.

687
00:40:33,455 --> 00:40:35,389
Every young man
feels the need

688
00:40:35,457 --> 00:40:38,051
to let the badger loose
now and again.

689
00:40:38,127 --> 00:40:40,391
I try to reason
with him. I can't.

690
00:40:40,462 --> 00:40:41,895
I can only
mother him.

691
00:40:41,964 --> 00:40:43,898
That's not
what he wants.

692
00:40:43,966 --> 00:40:46,400
<i>Like I said,
that you can change.</i>

693
00:40:46,468 --> 00:40:49,198
Don't you have enough
worries of your own?

694
00:40:49,271 --> 00:40:51,205
A few, but in general,

695
00:40:51,273 --> 00:40:54,606
I've had a hell
of a good time.

696
00:40:56,478 --> 00:40:57,911
Tell me, um...

697
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:00,346
what does the J.B.
Stand for?

698
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,348
John Bernard.

699
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:03,351
And yours?

700
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:04,443
Bond.

701
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:08,115
That's a crackerjack
of a name for a woman.

702
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:09,851
How do you do, Bond?

703
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:12,359
How do you do,
John Bernard?

704
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:13,452
Shall we?

705
00:41:13,529 --> 00:41:14,461
Hyah!

706
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:31,879
Good morning,
Mrs. Rogers!

707
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:33,380
Mr. Sweeney.

708
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:35,610
Mike Sweeney?

709
00:41:35,684 --> 00:41:38,710
John Bernard Books,

710
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:41,585
now, I'm flattered
that you remembered me.

711
00:41:41,657 --> 00:41:43,056
You live around here now?

712
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:45,616
My spread's in
the foothills to the west.

713
00:41:45,694 --> 00:41:49,391
Well, you look just like
I remember the Sweeneys...

714
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:51,228
mean and ugly.

715
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:54,235
Well, I heard
that you were in town

716
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:57,500
for a very short time.

717
00:41:57,573 --> 00:41:59,234
That's true.

718
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:00,502
Drop by.

719
00:42:00,576 --> 00:42:02,510
We'll talk about old times.

720
00:42:02,578 --> 00:42:04,011
The good old times.

721
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:05,671
Ha ha ha!

722
00:42:06,915 --> 00:42:09,509
You can bring
your fancy pillow,

723
00:42:09,585 --> 00:42:12,110
and your landlady
is welcome, too.

724
00:42:12,187 --> 00:42:13,245
Now, my problem is

725
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:15,847
that she never
accepts my invitation,

726
00:42:15,924 --> 00:42:19,917
and to you two,
I say good-bye.

727
00:42:24,266 --> 00:42:27,201
I'm surprised
at the company you keep.

728
00:42:27,269 --> 00:42:30,204
That man is no friend.
Quite the reverse.

729
00:42:30,272 --> 00:42:31,864
How do you know him?

730
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:34,374
I don't.
I had some dealings

731
00:42:34,443 --> 00:42:36,377
with his
brother Albert once.

732
00:42:36,445 --> 00:42:37,377
What happened?

733
00:42:38,447 --> 00:42:39,414
Oh.

734
00:42:39,481 --> 00:42:41,881
That's what worries me,
John Bernard...

735
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:44,214
the thought
of your victims.

736
00:42:44,286 --> 00:42:47,187
What worried me
was survival.

737
00:42:47,256 --> 00:42:50,384
Bond, I don't believe
I ever killed a man

738
00:42:50,459 --> 00:42:51,892
that didn't deserve it.

739
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:54,952
Surely, only the Lord
can judge that.

740
00:44:21,917 --> 00:44:22,849
Mr. Books!

741
00:44:24,086 --> 00:44:25,212
Mr. Books?

742
00:44:42,437 --> 00:44:43,870
Sir?

743
00:44:43,939 --> 00:44:45,304
Are you hurt?

744
00:44:45,374 --> 00:44:46,568
No.

745
00:44:47,843 --> 00:44:49,276
But they are.

746
00:44:50,445 --> 00:44:52,276
Call the marshal.

747
00:44:57,719 --> 00:44:59,209
He got both of them.

748
00:44:59,288 --> 00:45:01,813
They came in through
the windows... guns blazing.

749
00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:02,982
Close your robe.

750
00:45:03,058 --> 00:45:05,822
He's so damn fast,
he killed them both.

751
00:45:05,894 --> 00:45:08,829
John Bernard Books
in a shootout right here.

752
00:45:08,897 --> 00:45:10,330
Son of a bitch!

753
00:45:10,399 --> 00:45:13,334
I will not have that
language in my house.

754
00:45:13,402 --> 00:45:15,996
Sorry, but this
is a great day.

755
00:45:16,071 --> 00:45:18,198
Our house is
a part of history.

756
00:45:18,273 --> 00:45:19,638
You've got
to know that.

757
00:45:19,708 --> 00:45:21,539
That's nothing
to be proud of.

758
00:45:21,610 --> 00:45:23,339
I love that old man.

759
00:45:23,412 --> 00:45:24,777
Gillom! All right!

760
00:45:24,846 --> 00:45:26,837
It's time you knew.

761
00:45:26,915 --> 00:45:28,007
He's dying.

762
00:45:30,919 --> 00:45:32,181
Who?

763
00:45:32,254 --> 00:45:33,346
Mr. Books.

764
00:45:35,424 --> 00:45:36,891
I don't believe it.

765
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,193
He has a cancer.

766
00:45:41,763 --> 00:45:42,855
You're lying.

767
00:45:42,931 --> 00:45:44,956
He would have told me.

768
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:46,466
But he didn't tell you!

769
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:47,900
He told me.

770
00:45:50,072 --> 00:45:51,801
He's dying.

771
00:46:01,383 --> 00:46:02,407
Ma.

772
00:46:06,888 --> 00:46:07,946
Ma.

773
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:14,041
You do understand?

774
00:46:14,112 --> 00:46:16,046
That's the last of it.

775
00:46:16,114 --> 00:46:18,207
Thank you,
Mr. Hutchins.

776
00:46:18,283 --> 00:46:20,217
My position
as a teacher,

777
00:46:20,285 --> 00:46:21,718
as a maiden lady,

778
00:46:21,786 --> 00:46:24,721
I'm obliged to move
to another place.

779
00:46:24,789 --> 00:46:26,222
Of course.
I apologize.

780
00:46:26,291 --> 00:46:27,724
We're ready to go!

781
00:46:28,793 --> 00:46:29,760
Bye.

782
00:46:47,312 --> 00:46:48,244
Some coffee?

783
00:46:48,313 --> 00:46:50,247
Don't mind if I do.

784
00:46:50,315 --> 00:46:52,249
Did you know those two?

785
00:46:52,317 --> 00:46:53,249
Nope.

786
00:46:53,318 --> 00:46:54,751
They sure knew you.

787
00:46:54,819 --> 00:46:55,911
Who were they?

788
00:46:55,987 --> 00:46:58,251
Ben Shoup,
the one you killed

789
00:46:58,323 --> 00:46:59,688
trying to get out
the window.

790
00:46:59,757 --> 00:47:00,849
The other
named Norton...

791
00:47:00,925 --> 00:47:03,359
Two no-goods, not
from around here.

792
00:47:03,428 --> 00:47:05,191
I've never heard
of them.

793
00:47:05,263 --> 00:47:06,355
Quite a night.

794
00:47:06,431 --> 00:47:08,695
Your bedroom looks like
a slaughterhouse.

795
00:47:08,766 --> 00:47:09,858
Oh, Mrs. Rogers.

796
00:47:09,934 --> 00:47:12,164
I'll post a man
outside nights.

797
00:47:12,236 --> 00:47:14,670
That'll cost the taxpayers
$3.00 a night

798
00:47:14,739 --> 00:47:17,333
and $ 10 apiece to
plant two corpses.

799
00:47:17,408 --> 00:47:19,205
Death and taxes,
Books.

800
00:47:19,277 --> 00:47:21,211
Keeping you alive
to die natural

801
00:47:21,279 --> 00:47:23,179
is costing us
a pretty penny.

802
00:47:23,247 --> 00:47:25,715
There's no need
of any man outside.

803
00:47:25,783 --> 00:47:27,045
I'd appreciate that,
Marshal.

804
00:47:27,118 --> 00:47:28,050
Thank you.

805
00:47:29,287 --> 00:47:32,723
L... I can't tell you
how sorry I am

806
00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:34,724
about what happened
last night.

807
00:47:34,792 --> 00:47:36,225
That won't help.

808
00:47:36,294 --> 00:47:37,727
Two men are dead.

809
00:47:39,297 --> 00:47:41,527
I was defending myself.

810
00:47:47,305 --> 00:47:48,738
How are you feeling,

811
00:47:48,806 --> 00:47:50,740
a little more poorly
every day?

812
00:47:50,808 --> 00:47:53,743
You've got a streak of
kindness a mile wide.

813
00:47:53,811 --> 00:47:55,745
That I do.
Tell you what...

814
00:47:55,813 --> 00:47:58,748
Maybe I can help
speed things along.

815
00:47:58,816 --> 00:48:02,684
Did you read about the shooting
the night before last?

816
00:48:02,754 --> 00:48:03,686
No.

817
00:48:03,755 --> 00:48:05,689
Whooee! That
was some shooting.

818
00:48:05,757 --> 00:48:07,691
Pulford, he's
the faro dealer,

819
00:48:07,759 --> 00:48:09,693
got off one round
under fire,

820
00:48:09,761 --> 00:48:11,194
straight
through the heart,

821
00:48:11,262 --> 00:48:12,695
and it measured 84'3".

822
00:48:12,764 --> 00:48:15,198
Maybe I'll just
send him here,

823
00:48:15,266 --> 00:48:18,201
let him deal you
a little faro.

824
00:48:18,269 --> 00:48:19,361
You do that,
Marshal.

825
00:48:19,437 --> 00:48:20,699
This is 19-aught-1.

826
00:48:20,772 --> 00:48:23,707
The old days are gone.
You don't know it.

827
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:25,709
We've got waterworks,
telephones, lights.

828
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:28,712
We'll have our streetcar
electrified by next year,

829
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:31,214
and we've started
to pave the streets.

830
00:48:31,282 --> 00:48:33,716
We've still got
some weeding to do.

831
00:48:33,785 --> 00:48:36,720
Once we're rid
of people like you,

832
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:39,222
we'll have a goddamn
Garden of Eden here.

833
00:48:39,290 --> 00:48:41,224
To put it in a nutshell,

834
00:48:41,292 --> 00:48:43,453
you've plain plumb
outlived your time.

835
00:48:43,528 --> 00:48:46,895
You couldn't put it in
a barrel without a bottom.

836
00:48:46,964 --> 00:48:49,728
You're the longest-winded
bastard I ever listened to.

837
00:48:49,801 --> 00:48:52,235
I may be windy,
but I ain't ornery.

838
00:48:52,303 --> 00:48:54,032
When my time comes
to die,

839
00:48:54,105 --> 00:48:56,903
I won't drag it out.
I'll just do it.

840
00:48:56,974 --> 00:48:58,066
Why don't you?

841
00:48:58,142 --> 00:48:59,109
Thibido...

842
00:49:02,246 --> 00:49:04,077
I don't scare anymore.

843
00:49:04,148 --> 00:49:06,173
Neither did Shoup
or Norton.

844
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:09,617
You wouldn't gun down
a police officer.

845
00:49:09,687 --> 00:49:13,487
What'd stop me,
fear of dying?

846
00:49:56,033 --> 00:49:57,967
#John Bernard Books #

847
00:49:58,035 --> 00:50:00,970
# Lies amolderin'

848
00:50:01,038 --> 00:50:02,972
#John Bernard Books #

849
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:05,736
# Lies amolderin'

850
00:50:05,810 --> 00:50:07,675

851
00:50:07,745 --> 00:50:10,145
# Lies amolderin'

852
00:50:10,214 --> 00:50:12,011
# But his horse keeps #

00:50:12,083 --> 00:50:14,210
# Gallopin' on ##

854
00:50:14,285 --> 00:50:15,752
Moses?

855
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:17,811
Would you care
to do business

856
00:50:17,889 --> 00:50:19,789
with a voice
from the grave?

857
00:50:19,857 --> 00:50:21,381
Mr. Books!

858
00:50:21,459 --> 00:50:23,290
It's pure pleasure
to groom your horse!

859
00:50:23,361 --> 00:50:25,295
And even
a greater pleasure

860
00:50:25,363 --> 00:50:26,796
to do business
with you!

861
00:50:26,864 --> 00:50:28,729
Would you kindly
step into my office?

862
00:50:28,799 --> 00:50:30,994
Lt'll be a pleasure.

863
00:50:31,068 --> 00:50:32,535
Right this way, please.

864
00:50:35,406 --> 00:50:36,566
Yes, sir.

865
00:50:37,942 --> 00:50:39,375
Now, let me see

866
00:50:39,443 --> 00:50:41,377
where I put
my spectacles

867
00:50:41,445 --> 00:50:44,744
because I wouldn't
want to make no, uh...

868
00:50:44,815 --> 00:50:46,442
financial mistake.

869
00:50:48,486 --> 00:50:49,976
Yes, sir.

870
00:50:51,255 --> 00:50:53,189
Here they are, Mr. Books.

871
00:50:53,257 --> 00:50:55,191
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

872
00:50:55,259 --> 00:50:56,954
$ 100.

873
00:50:57,028 --> 00:50:59,462
That's a lot
of money, Moses.

874
00:50:59,530 --> 00:51:02,465
Who do I have...
What's this for?

875
00:51:02,533 --> 00:51:04,865
What's it for?
For your horse.

876
00:51:04,936 --> 00:51:07,370
My horse? I want
to sell my horse,

877
00:51:07,438 --> 00:51:09,372
but this wouldn't
buy my saddle.

878
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,874
But, Mr. Books,
you done agreed.

879
00:51:11,943 --> 00:51:12,967
When?

880
00:51:13,044 --> 00:51:14,477
When you sent Gilly...

881
00:51:14,545 --> 00:51:16,979
I mean, when Mr. Rogers
said this morning

882
00:51:17,048 --> 00:51:19,482
$ 100 would be
just fine with you.

883
00:51:19,550 --> 00:51:21,984
I'll have to have a talk
with Mr. Rogers.

884
00:51:22,053 --> 00:51:24,385
As far as
the horse goes, it's 3.

885
00:51:24,455 --> 00:51:26,320
300?

886
00:51:26,390 --> 00:51:27,880
300.

887
00:51:27,959 --> 00:51:31,690
I might maybe
can go 200.

888
00:51:31,762 --> 00:51:34,196
You might maybe
go more than that

889
00:51:34,265 --> 00:51:36,699
'cause you'll get more than
that 'cause it's mine.

890
00:51:36,767 --> 00:51:37,961
3.

891
00:51:38,035 --> 00:51:39,798
250.

892
00:51:39,870 --> 00:51:42,862
3, and I'll throw
the saddle in for cash.

893
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:44,373
What about my bill?

894
00:51:44,442 --> 00:51:46,307
You throw that in.

895
00:51:46,377 --> 00:51:48,345
I ain't made of money.

896
00:51:48,412 --> 00:51:51,677
Are we going to stand
here and haggle all day?

897
00:51:54,485 --> 00:51:59,354
Mr. Books, you the most
famous man I ever seen

898
00:51:59,423 --> 00:52:00,856
and the second-best
haggler.

899
00:52:00,925 --> 00:52:02,392
Who's the best?

900
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:04,087
Here I stand.

901
00:52:04,161 --> 00:52:05,924
Well, let's get
to haggling.

902
00:52:05,997 --> 00:52:08,591
Let's get to haggling.
All right.

903
00:52:08,666 --> 00:52:11,533
Let's get to haggling.

904
00:52:11,602 --> 00:52:13,593
1, 2, 3, 4.

905
00:52:13,671 --> 00:52:16,333
That's 200. 200.

906
00:52:18,809 --> 00:52:20,538
200 there.

907
00:52:20,611 --> 00:52:26,743
20, 40, 60,
80, 90, 295.

908
00:52:26,817 --> 00:52:27,909
No.

909
00:52:30,588 --> 00:52:32,021
296?

910
00:52:32,089 --> 00:52:33,283
No.

911
00:52:33,357 --> 00:52:35,757
97?

912
00:52:37,261 --> 00:52:38,785
98?

913
00:52:38,863 --> 00:52:39,887
Sold.

914
00:52:39,964 --> 00:52:42,592
You mean I did it?

915
00:52:42,667 --> 00:52:46,535
Mr. Books, that makes me
the best haggler!

916
00:52:46,604 --> 00:52:49,038
The best
in the world, Moses.

917
00:52:49,106 --> 00:52:50,346
Yes, sir.

918
00:52:52,081 --> 00:52:53,013
Gillom!

919
00:52:56,952 --> 00:52:58,010
Gillom!

920
00:52:59,455 --> 00:53:00,387
Where's Gillom?

921
00:53:00,456 --> 00:53:01,889
In the woodshed.

922
00:53:01,957 --> 00:53:03,720
That's appropriate.

923
00:53:03,793 --> 00:53:05,124
Why?

924
00:53:05,194 --> 00:53:07,128
You stay out of this.

925
00:53:15,404 --> 00:53:16,462
Gillom!

926
00:53:16,539 --> 00:53:17,972
I'm in here.

927
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:20,873
You'll account to me.

928
00:53:20,943 --> 00:53:21,875
Sir?

929
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,914
You were trying
to cheat me,

930
00:53:26,982 --> 00:53:29,849
and Moses was trying
to cheat you.

931
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:32,352
I'm sorry.

932
00:53:32,421 --> 00:53:35,356
I'm glad of that,
but it doesn't...

933
00:53:37,259 --> 00:53:39,693
it doesn't tell me
very much.

934
00:53:42,498 --> 00:53:43,590
She, uh...

935
00:53:45,768 --> 00:53:48,703
She cried on my shoulder
this morning

936
00:53:48,771 --> 00:53:50,204
on account of you.

937
00:53:52,374 --> 00:53:54,308
I had to comfort her.

938
00:53:55,911 --> 00:53:58,345
And then the lodgers
moved out.

939
00:53:58,414 --> 00:54:00,348
Your room is a mess...

940
00:54:00,416 --> 00:54:03,943
and now Ma's worried
about losing the house.

941
00:54:05,454 --> 00:54:07,388
Well, I just thought
that...

942
00:54:07,456 --> 00:54:09,890
that maybe you might
want to do something

943
00:54:09,959 --> 00:54:12,393
to try and make it up
to her.

944
00:54:12,461 --> 00:54:14,395
I thought you might
be interested

945
00:54:14,463 --> 00:54:16,897
in selling your horse
since you're...

946
00:54:16,966 --> 00:54:18,695
Since I'm what?

947
00:54:21,737 --> 00:54:23,568
You're dying.

948
00:54:25,975 --> 00:54:28,535
How did you
find that out?

949
00:54:28,611 --> 00:54:31,205
Ma told me.

950
00:54:32,815 --> 00:54:36,876
Guess I'm the last one
in town to know about it.

951
00:54:36,952 --> 00:54:39,386
Don't you think you
should have talked to me

952
00:54:39,455 --> 00:54:41,889
before you tried
to sell my horse?

953
00:54:41,957 --> 00:54:43,754
Yes, sir.

954
00:54:43,826 --> 00:54:45,293
I suppose.

955
00:54:45,361 --> 00:54:48,296
But I just wanted
to see first

956
00:54:48,364 --> 00:54:51,299
if Moses would buy it,
that's all.

957
00:54:51,367 --> 00:54:53,335
I'm not a horse thief.

958
00:55:01,210 --> 00:55:03,576
A man's emotions can...

959
00:55:03,646 --> 00:55:06,672
tangle him all up
sometimes.

960
00:55:06,749 --> 00:55:11,243
I've been operating on
the raw edge lately, Gillom.

961
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:16,223
Guess I just jumped
too far too fast.

962
00:55:16,292 --> 00:55:21,924
But, son, I never thought
you were a horse thief.

963
00:55:21,997 --> 00:55:24,431
And I hope I can
hang around long enough

964
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:26,468
to make it up to you.

965
00:55:29,338 --> 00:55:30,270
Sir...

966
00:55:30,339 --> 00:55:32,239
do you think...

967
00:55:32,308 --> 00:55:35,971
Would you give me
a shooting lesson?

968
00:55:36,045 --> 00:55:37,478
A shooting lesson?

969
00:55:37,546 --> 00:55:41,607
Well, a man should know
how to handle a gun,

970
00:55:41,684 --> 00:55:43,811
use it with discretion.

971
00:55:43,886 --> 00:55:45,478
But, uh...

972
00:55:45,554 --> 00:55:48,114
you going to tell
your mother?

973
00:55:49,325 --> 00:55:51,293
Well... do I have to?

974
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:54,796
Come on, I'll get us
something to shoot with.

975
00:56:03,105 --> 00:56:04,197
It's beautiful.

976
00:56:06,242 --> 00:56:09,678
See that tree
on the left

977
00:56:09,745 --> 00:56:11,178
with the divided trunk?

978
00:56:11,247 --> 00:56:12,680
You take the right side.

979
00:56:12,748 --> 00:56:15,182
Aim well and put
five slugs in it.

980
00:56:15,251 --> 00:56:16,684
Why not six?

981
00:56:16,752 --> 00:56:19,619
You keep your hammer on
an empty chamber for safety.

982
00:56:19,688 --> 00:56:22,623
And if you're going out
to face somebody?

983
00:56:22,691 --> 00:56:25,626
Load six if your insides
tells you to.

984
00:56:25,694 --> 00:56:27,355
Now, take your time.

985
00:56:45,915 --> 00:56:47,849
That's good shooting,
Gillom.

986
00:57:12,708 --> 00:57:14,175
Hey, Mr. Books,

987
00:57:14,243 --> 00:57:16,438
my spread's not much
bigger than yours.

988
00:57:16,512 --> 00:57:18,673
You did well.

989
00:57:18,747 --> 00:57:19,873
Where did you learn
to shoot like that?

990
00:57:19,949 --> 00:57:23,112
Jay Cobb lets me practice
with him by the lake...

991
00:57:23,185 --> 00:57:25,119
when he's not in jail.

992
00:57:25,187 --> 00:57:28,782
Day before yesterday, he
smashed some salesman's jaw.

993
00:57:28,857 --> 00:57:30,916
Nice employer
you have.

994
00:57:30,993 --> 00:57:33,325
Well, it's just
temporary...

995
00:57:33,395 --> 00:57:36,626
till I find
whatever's right for me.

996
00:57:36,699 --> 00:57:37,631
Yeah.

997
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:39,133
Wouldn't I like to see

998
00:57:39,201 --> 00:57:41,635
him and Jack Pulford
go at it.

999
00:57:41,704 --> 00:57:44,138
Did you hear about
what Pulford did?

1000
00:57:44,206 --> 00:57:45,138
I did.

1001
00:57:45,207 --> 00:57:46,333
Mr. Books.

1002
00:57:46,408 --> 00:57:47,500
Yeah?

1003
00:57:47,576 --> 00:57:50,010
How did you ever kill
so many men?

1004
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:54,015
I lived most of my life
in the wild country,

1005
00:57:54,083 --> 00:57:57,519
and you set a code
of laws to live by.

1006
00:57:57,586 --> 00:57:58,848
What laws?

1007
00:57:58,921 --> 00:58:01,856
I won't be wronged,
I won't be insulted,

1008
00:58:01,924 --> 00:58:04,358
I won't be laid
a hand on.

1009
00:58:04,426 --> 00:58:06,860
I don't do these things
to other people,

1010
00:58:06,929 --> 00:58:09,625
and I require
the same from them.

1011
00:58:09,698 --> 00:58:12,132
But how could you get
into so many fights

1012
00:58:12,201 --> 00:58:14,135
and always come out
on top?

1013
00:58:14,203 --> 00:58:15,636
I nearly tied you
shooting.

1014
00:58:15,704 --> 00:58:19,105
There's nobody up there
shooting back at you.

1015
00:58:19,174 --> 00:58:21,108
It isn't always
being fast

1016
00:58:21,176 --> 00:58:23,110
or even accurate
that counts.

1017
00:58:23,178 --> 00:58:24,907
It's being willing.

1018
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:28,245
I found out early
that most men,

1019
00:58:28,317 --> 00:58:30,182
regardless of cause
or need,

1020
00:58:30,252 --> 00:58:31,184
aren't willing.

1021
00:58:31,253 --> 00:58:34,188
They blink an eye
or draw a breath

1022
00:58:34,256 --> 00:58:36,190
before they pull
the trigger.

1023
00:58:36,258 --> 00:58:37,486
I won't.

1024
00:58:37,559 --> 00:58:39,026
Bat Masterson told Cobb...

1025
00:58:39,094 --> 00:58:40,755
Bat Masterson?

1026
00:58:40,829 --> 00:58:42,091
Yeah.

1027
00:58:42,164 --> 00:58:45,099
He says that a man
has to have, uh...

1028
00:58:45,167 --> 00:58:49,661
guts, deliberation, and
a proficiency with firearms.

1029
00:58:49,738 --> 00:58:52,434
Did he mention that
third eye you better have?

1030
00:58:52,508 --> 00:58:53,805
Third eye?

1031
00:58:53,876 --> 00:58:56,037
For that dumb-ass
amateur.

1032
00:58:56,111 --> 00:58:58,602
It's usually some
six-fingered bustard

1033
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:01,080
that couldn't hit
a cow in the tit

1034
00:59:01,150 --> 00:59:02,344
with a tin cup

1035
00:59:02,418 --> 00:59:04,511
that does you in.

1036
00:59:04,586 --> 00:59:06,019
But then,
Bat Masterson

1037
00:59:06,088 --> 00:59:08,522
always was
full of sheep dip.

1038
00:59:08,590 --> 00:59:11,650
Whoa. I hope you're
smart enough to know

1039
00:59:11,727 --> 00:59:15,094
that that who hit John
don't go with guns.

1040
00:59:15,164 --> 00:59:18,361
Oh, sure. Yes, sir.

1041
00:59:18,434 --> 00:59:21,369
Well, now that we got
that cleared up...

1042
00:59:21,437 --> 00:59:23,564
as my Mexican friend
said,

1043
00:59:23,639 --> 00:59:25,834
"To the pure life. "

1044
00:59:40,785 --> 00:59:41,717
Johnny?

1045
00:59:43,254 --> 00:59:44,186
Yes?

1046
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:46,348
May I come in?

1047
00:59:55,066 --> 00:59:57,967
Don't... Don't you
remember me?

1048
00:59:58,035 --> 01:00:00,629
Serepta?

1049
01:00:02,673 --> 01:00:04,106
Oh.

1050
01:00:04,175 --> 01:00:09,408
Sera, I can't tell you
how happy I am you're here.

1051
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,914
I came
the minute I heard.

1052
01:00:22,226 --> 01:00:24,353
Have I changed
so much?

1053
01:00:25,997 --> 01:00:29,489
No, it's... just been
a long time.

1054
01:00:32,403 --> 01:00:34,462
It isn't true,
is it?

1055
01:00:34,538 --> 01:00:36,506
God, how I loved you.

1056
01:00:36,574 --> 01:00:39,065
And I loved you.

1057
01:00:40,511 --> 01:00:42,035
Is it true?

1058
01:00:44,849 --> 01:00:46,282
Oh, no.

1059
01:00:46,350 --> 01:00:48,318
Aw, don't cry, Sera.

1060
01:00:48,386 --> 01:00:50,718
We all have our time.

1061
01:00:56,060 --> 01:00:57,994
I must look a sight.

1062
01:01:00,064 --> 01:01:01,793
For sore eyes.

1063
01:01:07,738 --> 01:01:09,365
You still with Pardee?

1064
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:13,467
No. He treated me
the way I did you.

1065
01:01:13,544 --> 01:01:15,478
He just
up and skipped.

1066
01:01:18,449 --> 01:01:19,882
We should have married.

1067
01:01:19,950 --> 01:01:22,077
Spilt milk.

1068
01:01:23,254 --> 01:01:24,687
You never did, huh?

1069
01:01:24,755 --> 01:01:26,347
No.

1070
01:01:26,424 --> 01:01:30,155
Now you're alone.
I'm so glad I'm here.

1071
01:01:30,227 --> 01:01:31,660
So am I.

1072
01:01:35,332 --> 01:01:37,197
Would you still
like to?

1073
01:01:39,403 --> 01:01:43,737
We could get a minister
and just say I do.

1074
01:01:43,808 --> 01:01:46,242
That way, I'd have
the certificate.

1075
01:01:46,310 --> 01:01:48,744
I'd have something
to go on.

1076
01:01:48,813 --> 01:01:49,745
Not much.

1077
01:01:49,814 --> 01:01:51,247
I'd have your name.

1078
01:01:51,315 --> 01:01:53,749
How far would that
take you?

1079
01:01:53,818 --> 01:01:56,286
Long ways, maybe.

1080
01:01:57,688 --> 01:01:58,780
How?

1081
01:02:00,658 --> 01:02:03,718
Johnny, you're too
modest, you know?

1082
01:02:03,794 --> 01:02:06,354
Everybody knows
who you are.

1083
01:02:06,430 --> 01:02:08,864
I'd be
Mrs. J.B. Books.

1084
01:02:08,933 --> 01:02:10,457
I'd be somebody.

1085
01:02:10,534 --> 01:02:13,264
That wouldn't buy you
any bacon.

1086
01:02:14,605 --> 01:02:17,096
Well, it might.

1087
01:02:17,174 --> 01:02:20,610
See, that's how come
I knew that you had...

1088
01:02:22,847 --> 01:02:25,281
that-that you was
ailing bad.

1089
01:02:25,349 --> 01:02:28,443
This newspaper reporter
here tracked me down.

1090
01:02:28,519 --> 01:02:30,953
He wants to put out
a book on you.

1091
01:02:31,021 --> 01:02:34,184
He'll write it
and use my name.

1092
01:02:34,258 --> 01:02:35,623
<i>The Shootist...</i>

1093
01:02:35,693 --> 01:02:38,025
<i>The Life and Bloody
Times ofJ.B. Books</i>

1094
01:02:38,095 --> 01:02:40,859
by Serepta Books,
his wife.

1095
01:02:40,931 --> 01:02:42,364
He said
in the East

1096
01:02:42,433 --> 01:02:44,367
that it would sell
like hot cakes

1097
01:02:44,435 --> 01:02:47,029
and he'd split it
with me.

1098
01:02:47,104 --> 01:02:49,299
And his name is Dobkins.

1099
01:02:49,373 --> 01:02:51,034
Right. How did you know?

1100
01:02:51,108 --> 01:02:54,805
I kicked him out of here
for the same reason.

1101
01:02:56,447 --> 01:02:58,381
Johnny,
what harm is there

1102
01:02:58,449 --> 01:03:01,111
in a marriage certificate,
a piece of paper?

1103
01:03:01,185 --> 01:03:03,710
I don't object to that.
It's the book.

1104
01:03:03,787 --> 01:03:04,981
Why?

1105
01:03:05,055 --> 01:03:06,454
What does he know
about my life?

1106
01:03:06,524 --> 01:03:08,151
What do you know?

1107
01:03:08,225 --> 01:03:12,662
He says what he doesn't
know, he'll make up,

1108
01:03:12,730 --> 01:03:14,698
and, you know,
gory things,

1109
01:03:14,765 --> 01:03:16,790
shoot-'em-ups
and midnight rides

1110
01:03:16,867 --> 01:03:18,801
and women tearing
out their hair.

1111
01:03:18,869 --> 01:03:21,497
It will be a corker,
I promise you.

1112
01:03:21,572 --> 01:03:23,733
<i>Woman, I still have
some pride.</i>

1113
01:03:25,309 --> 01:03:28,836
A man should be allowed
his human dignity.

1114
01:03:36,453 --> 01:03:39,388
I spent $3.00
on the train here.

1115
01:03:39,456 --> 01:03:40,946
One-way.

1116
01:03:44,795 --> 01:03:49,732
You and Dobkins are two sides
of a counterfeit coin.

1117
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:51,927
I'll pay you back.

1118
01:03:52,002 --> 01:03:54,436
I'll pay you both ways.

1119
01:03:56,540 --> 01:03:58,474
What's wrong
about a book?

1120
01:03:58,542 --> 01:04:01,978
I'll not be remembered
for a pack of lies.

1121
01:04:02,046 --> 01:04:05,743
'Cause you're too damn
mule mean, that's why.

1122
01:04:05,816 --> 01:04:07,511
You always was.

1123
01:04:07,585 --> 01:04:10,520
Why should you care what's
happening? You're dying.

1124
01:04:10,588 --> 01:04:12,522
I have
to go on living,

1125
01:04:12,590 --> 01:04:15,525
and you don't give a hoot
in hell what happens!

1126
01:04:15,593 --> 01:04:18,528
Why should you?
You won't be here!

1127
01:04:18,596 --> 01:04:20,894
God. And I loved you once.

1128
01:04:22,299 --> 01:04:24,426
You bastard.

1129
01:04:24,501 --> 01:04:27,299
May you rot to death!

1130
01:04:45,956 --> 01:04:48,754
# 'Twas blighted
affection #

1131
01:04:48,826 --> 01:04:51,317
# That made him exclaim #

1132
01:04:51,395 --> 01:04:54,023
# Oh, willow
tit-willow #

1133
01:04:54,098 --> 01:04:56,828
# Tit-willow #

1134
01:04:56,900 --> 01:04:59,095
# And if you remain
callous #

1135
01:04:59,169 --> 01:05:01,797
# And obdurate, I #

1136
01:05:01,872 --> 01:05:04,067
# Shall perish
as he did #

1137
01:05:04,141 --> 01:05:07,838
# And you will
know why #

1138
01:05:07,911 --> 01:05:11,904
# Though I probably
shall not exclaim #

1139
01:05:11,982 --> 01:05:14,109
# As I die #

1140
01:05:14,184 --> 01:05:15,674
# Oh, willow #

1141
01:05:15,753 --> 01:05:17,380
# Tit-willow #

1142
01:05:17,454 --> 01:05:19,922
# Tit-willow
says I ##

1143
01:05:19,990 --> 01:05:21,924
You seem
in fine fettle today.

1144
01:05:21,992 --> 01:05:24,927
I should be.
I'm full of laudanum.

1145
01:05:24,995 --> 01:05:26,428
I'll get
your breakfast.

1146
01:05:26,497 --> 01:05:27,930
Good. Thank you.

1147
01:05:27,998 --> 01:05:31,297
I didn't mean
to break up the recital.

1148
01:05:31,368 --> 01:05:32,801
Oh, that's all right.

1149
01:05:32,870 --> 01:05:34,303
It was just something

1150
01:05:34,371 --> 01:05:35,804
for the Sunday School
class

1151
01:05:35,873 --> 01:05:37,238
for the church social.

1152
01:05:37,308 --> 01:05:41,005
Bond, uh, I've driven off
all your other lodgers.

1153
01:05:41,078 --> 01:05:44,707
Is it all right if I
have breakfast out here?

1154
01:05:44,782 --> 01:05:46,215
Of course it is.

1155
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:52,847
I was delighted to see you
had a lady caller yesterday.

1156
01:05:52,923 --> 01:05:55,858
She asked me
not to announce her.

1157
01:05:55,926 --> 01:05:59,726
She said she wanted
to surprise you.

1158
01:05:59,797 --> 01:06:01,526
Were you surprised?

1159
01:06:01,598 --> 01:06:03,691
That I was.

1160
01:06:03,767 --> 01:06:05,564
Oh, these clothes,
uh...

1161
01:06:05,636 --> 01:06:08,127
they're my
Sunday-go-to-meetings.

1162
01:06:08,205 --> 01:06:10,639
I wish you'd give them
a good brushing.

1163
01:06:10,708 --> 01:06:11,640
Certainly.

1164
01:06:13,243 --> 01:06:15,803
They're getting
pretty roady.

1165
01:06:15,879 --> 01:06:18,814
Nine days on the back
of a saddle

1166
01:06:18,882 --> 01:06:20,315
in a bedroll.

1167
01:06:20,384 --> 01:06:22,682
Wouldn't you rather
have them cleaned?

1168
01:06:22,753 --> 01:06:24,687
That's the general idea.

1169
01:06:24,755 --> 01:06:26,689
I mean there's
a new method

1170
01:06:26,757 --> 01:06:28,190
called dry-process
cleaning.

1171
01:06:28,258 --> 01:06:29,691
It's very good.

1172
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:31,193
How long does it take?

1173
01:06:31,261 --> 01:06:32,694
They advertise
next-day service,

1174
01:06:32,763 --> 01:06:34,196
but tomorrow's
Sunday.

1175
01:06:34,264 --> 01:06:36,630
I'm afraid I'll have
to settle for the brushing

1176
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:39,134
'cause I'll need them
first thing Monday morning.

1177
01:06:39,203 --> 01:06:41,637
I'll ask. If I can't
get them by then,

1178
01:06:41,705 --> 01:06:43,138
I'll brush them.

1179
01:06:43,207 --> 01:06:45,641
I'll get
your ham and eggs.

1180
01:06:45,709 --> 01:06:47,870
Just biscuits will do.

1181
01:06:47,945 --> 01:06:50,345
My stomach's
kind of feeble today.

1182
01:06:50,414 --> 01:06:53,178
Oh. You sure

1183
01:06:53,250 --> 01:06:55,115
you won't want these
for church tomorrow?

1184
01:06:55,185 --> 01:06:58,348
I don't think so.

1185
01:06:58,422 --> 01:07:01,740
You're most welcome to
accompany Gillom and me.

1186
01:07:01,807 --> 01:07:03,741
Maybe your church
won't welcome me.

1187
01:07:03,809 --> 01:07:06,073
That's a terrible thing
to say.

1188
01:07:06,145 --> 01:07:09,080
Doors of the church
are open to everyone.

1189
01:07:09,148 --> 01:07:12,481
Well, my church has been
the mountains and solitude.

1190
01:07:12,551 --> 01:07:13,984
No doors at all.

1191
01:07:14,053 --> 01:07:17,454
That's hardly
the same thing.

1192
01:07:17,523 --> 01:07:19,957
We all need a minister
to guide us.

1193
01:07:20,025 --> 01:07:22,323
Well, if you think of it,

1194
01:07:22,394 --> 01:07:24,828
give a thought
to my soul tomorrow.

1195
01:07:24,897 --> 01:07:27,331
I will. I have been
praying for you.

1196
01:07:27,399 --> 01:07:29,333
I think Gillom has, too.

1197
01:07:29,401 --> 01:07:31,460
Thank you.
Thank you both.

1198
01:07:32,738 --> 01:07:34,171
Tell me, um...

1199
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:37,607
what did he do yesterday
that made you so angry?

1200
01:07:37,676 --> 01:07:39,507
It isn't what he did.

1201
01:07:39,578 --> 01:07:41,341
It's what he didn't do.

1202
01:07:41,413 --> 01:07:42,846
We have that
straightened out.

1203
01:07:42,915 --> 01:07:45,349
You should be proud
of Gillom.

1204
01:07:45,417 --> 01:07:47,851
He has the making
of something special.

1205
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:49,353
I hope so.

1206
01:07:49,421 --> 01:07:51,582
I'm going to send
Reverend Saunders

1207
01:07:51,657 --> 01:07:52,624
to see you tomorrow.

1208
01:07:52,691 --> 01:07:54,682
No, thank you.

1209
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:57,194
Maybe it'll make it
easier for you.

1210
01:07:57,263 --> 01:07:58,195
No.

1211
01:07:58,264 --> 01:08:00,357
Just for a few minutes.

1212
01:08:00,432 --> 01:08:02,866
Bond, I'm tired of people
pawing over my death

1213
01:08:02,935 --> 01:08:05,802
for this reason or that
or for any reason.

1214
01:08:05,871 --> 01:08:08,465
A man's death is about
the most private thing

1215
01:08:08,541 --> 01:08:09,974
in his life.

1216
01:08:10,042 --> 01:08:12,636
It doesn't belong to Dobkins
or Reverend Saunders

1217
01:08:12,711 --> 01:08:14,144
or Thibido or you.

1218
01:08:14,213 --> 01:08:15,305
It's mine.

1219
01:08:15,381 --> 01:08:17,849
I suppose that's true
of your soul, too.

1220
01:08:17,917 --> 01:08:20,351
My soul is what
I've already made of it.

1221
01:08:20,419 --> 01:08:23,354
You reprimand me
for making judgments

1222
01:08:23,422 --> 01:08:25,856
with a gun barrel
poked in my face,

1223
01:08:25,925 --> 01:08:29,383
but it's all right for you
to judge me on hearsay.

1224
01:08:29,461 --> 01:08:30,655
But the hearsay fits.

1225
01:08:30,729 --> 01:08:33,163
Maybe I'm better than
you've already decided.

1226
01:08:33,232 --> 01:08:37,168
Maybe I'm no worse
than that good reverend.

1227
01:08:37,236 --> 01:08:39,170
Maybe you like
being a gunman.

1228
01:08:39,238 --> 01:08:41,206
You probably prefer
the word shootist.

1229
01:08:41,273 --> 01:08:43,935
I don't think
of myself as either.

1230
01:08:44,009 --> 01:08:45,943
Oh, no. You're some
godlike creature

1231
01:08:46,011 --> 01:08:47,603
of infinite knowledge,
aren't you?

1232
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:50,808
I'm a dying man
scared of the dark.

1233
01:08:52,184 --> 01:08:55,620
Damn you! Damn you for
the pain you've brought

1234
01:08:55,688 --> 01:08:57,246
into this house.

1235
01:10:07,993 --> 01:10:09,426
There we are, sir.

1236
01:10:15,968 --> 01:10:17,128
Mr. Books.

1237
01:10:17,202 --> 01:10:18,464
Yes, sir?

1238
01:10:18,537 --> 01:10:20,971
I'm Hezekiah Beckum,
the undertaker, sir.

1239
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:22,473
How do you do?

1240
01:10:22,541 --> 01:10:25,510
I hope you don't think
my stopping by

1241
01:10:25,577 --> 01:10:27,010
is untimely, sir.

1242
01:10:27,079 --> 01:10:31,106
No, I admire a man
with get-up-and-go.

1243
01:10:31,183 --> 01:10:34,118
As the saying goes
in our profession,

1244
01:10:34,186 --> 01:10:37,155
the early worm
gets the bird.

1245
01:10:38,557 --> 01:10:42,493
I, uh, admit to having heard
some unfortunate things.

1246
01:10:42,561 --> 01:10:45,496
I'd like to express
my heartfelt regret.

1247
01:10:45,564 --> 01:10:47,623
All right.
What's your proposition?

1248
01:10:47,700 --> 01:10:50,134
I'm prepared to offer
you embalming

1249
01:10:50,202 --> 01:10:52,966
by the most, uh,
scientific methods,

1250
01:10:53,038 --> 01:10:56,235
a bronze coffin guaranteed
good for a century

1251
01:10:56,308 --> 01:10:57,741
regardless
of the climatic

1252
01:10:57,810 --> 01:10:59,744
or geological
conditions,

1253
01:10:59,812 --> 01:11:01,245
my best hearse,

1254
01:11:01,313 --> 01:11:03,747
uh, the minister
of your choice,

1255
01:11:03,816 --> 01:11:07,547
and the presence of at
least, uh, two mourners...

1256
01:11:07,619 --> 01:11:10,918
a headstone of the finest
Carrera marble...

1257
01:11:10,989 --> 01:11:13,423
and a plot in size
and location

1258
01:11:13,492 --> 01:11:15,050
befitting
your status, sir...

1259
01:11:15,127 --> 01:11:17,561
and perpetual care
of the grounds.

1260
01:11:17,629 --> 01:11:19,529
For how much?

1261
01:11:19,598 --> 01:11:22,328
Why, nothing, sir.
For the privilege.

1262
01:11:22,401 --> 01:11:26,201
No, I mean how much will
you make on the deal?

1263
01:11:26,271 --> 01:11:28,705
Oh, Beckum,
you're going to do to me

1264
01:11:28,774 --> 01:11:31,208
what they did
to John Wesley Hardin.

1265
01:11:31,276 --> 01:11:33,210
You're going
to lay me out,

1266
01:11:33,278 --> 01:11:36,645
let the public gawp at me
for 50 cents a head,

1267
01:11:36,715 --> 01:11:38,649
10 cents
for the children.

1268
01:11:38,717 --> 01:11:40,150
When the curiosity
peters out,

1269
01:11:40,219 --> 01:11:42,084
you'll stick me
in a hole

1270
01:11:42,154 --> 01:11:44,588
while you hurry to
the bank with your loot.

1271
01:11:44,656 --> 01:11:46,385
I assure you...

1272
01:11:46,458 --> 01:11:48,892
Give me a scrap
of paper and a pencil.

1273
01:11:48,961 --> 01:11:50,952
What good's
your assurance

1274
01:11:51,029 --> 01:11:54,294
when my veins are filled
with your damn juice?

1275
01:11:54,366 --> 01:11:57,301
No. Here's what
you're going to do.

1276
01:11:58,704 --> 01:12:01,639
First you're going
to give me $50 cash.

1277
01:12:01,707 --> 01:12:03,140
Then early
Monday morning,

1278
01:12:03,208 --> 01:12:05,472
you'll bring me
a headstone.

1279
01:12:05,544 --> 01:12:08,980
I want a small headstone
with this written on it.

1280
01:12:09,047 --> 01:12:10,378
Nothing else.

1281
01:12:10,449 --> 01:12:12,883
No jabbery, no angels.
You got that?

1282
01:12:12,951 --> 01:12:15,818
Mr. Books,
you're a hard man.

1283
01:12:15,888 --> 01:12:17,412
I'm alive.

1284
01:12:17,489 --> 01:12:19,923
Ah, very well.

1285
01:12:19,992 --> 01:12:21,926
I'll set
my stonecutter

1286
01:12:21,994 --> 01:12:24,428
to work on the inscription
immediately.

1287
01:12:24,496 --> 01:12:26,555
Mr. Beckum.

1288
01:12:26,632 --> 01:12:28,657
The $50.

1289
01:12:28,734 --> 01:12:30,258
Oh. Hmm.

1290
01:12:37,543 --> 01:12:39,568
Thank you, sir.

1291
01:12:47,352 --> 01:12:49,343
Early worm,
early worm.

1292
01:12:49,421 --> 01:12:52,857
That Beckum is just
what you say he is.

1293
01:12:52,925 --> 01:12:56,827
Well... now,
how much do I owe you?

1294
01:12:56,895 --> 01:12:58,829
Not one bitty penny,
Mr. Books.

1295
01:12:58,897 --> 01:13:01,331
Why, to watch that
performance you done give,

1296
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:04,335
I'd have paid $ 10
in a theater.

1297
01:13:04,403 --> 01:13:07,668
Well, I may just accept
your generosity.

1298
01:13:11,610 --> 01:13:14,044
Besides, I may
just see if Beckum

1299
01:13:14,112 --> 01:13:16,546
would like to buy some
of J.B. Books' hair.

1300
01:13:16,615 --> 01:13:18,139
With
your permission.

1301
01:13:18,217 --> 01:13:19,149
Permission granted.

1302
01:13:19,218 --> 01:13:22,152
Good day, sir.

1303
01:13:38,804 --> 01:13:40,237
What the hell?

1304
01:13:45,577 --> 01:13:48,671
And the third man's
name is...

1305
01:13:50,816 --> 01:13:53,250
Mike Sweeney.
Do you know him?

1306
01:13:53,318 --> 01:13:56,253
Sure, I do. He's got one of
those horseless carriages.

1307
01:13:56,321 --> 01:13:59,256
And now for the favor
I'm going to ask you.

1308
01:13:59,324 --> 01:14:01,758
You just tell me, sir.
Anything at all.

1309
01:14:01,827 --> 01:14:05,263
Don't dive in till
you know how deep it is.

1310
01:14:05,330 --> 01:14:07,264
Today's the 27th,
isn't it?

1311
01:14:07,332 --> 01:14:08,765
Yes, sir.

1312
01:14:08,834 --> 01:14:13,931
Now, that's Jack Pulford,
Jay Cobb, and Mike Sweeney.

1313
01:14:14,006 --> 01:14:16,270
Tomorrow morning early,

1314
01:14:16,341 --> 01:14:19,276
I want you to go to each one
of them and tell them

1315
01:14:19,344 --> 01:14:20,333
that I'll be at the
Metropole

1316
01:14:20,412 --> 01:14:23,279
at 11 A.M.
On Monday the 29th,

1317
01:14:23,348 --> 01:14:27,785
and don't tell any of them
that you've told the others.

1318
01:14:27,853 --> 01:14:29,787
Cobb's still in jail.

1319
01:14:29,855 --> 01:14:31,789
Yeah, well,
tell him anyway.

1320
01:14:31,857 --> 01:14:34,792
Think you can
do that for me?

1321
01:14:34,860 --> 01:14:36,725
Well, I know I can,

1322
01:14:36,795 --> 01:14:39,730
but, uh, Ma's going
to have conniptions

1323
01:14:39,798 --> 01:14:43,234
if I don't go to
church in the morning.

1324
01:14:43,302 --> 01:14:44,997
You can go
to church first.

1325
01:14:45,070 --> 01:14:46,435
I telephoned Moses.

1326
01:14:46,505 --> 01:14:49,906
You can ride Old Dollar
out to the Sweeney spread.

1327
01:14:49,975 --> 01:14:51,101
Yes, sir.

1328
01:14:51,176 --> 01:14:54,077
Thank you and...

1329
01:14:54,146 --> 01:14:56,171
and good night.

1330
01:14:59,318 --> 01:15:01,047
Son of a bitch.

1331
01:15:04,823 --> 01:15:06,222
Don't cuss.

1332
01:15:09,328 --> 01:15:10,795
Yes, sir.

1333
01:15:25,936 --> 01:15:29,269
You know that kind of
music gets on my nerves,

1334
01:15:29,339 --> 01:15:30,363
especially on Sunday.

1335
01:15:30,441 --> 01:15:31,874
Sorry.

1336
01:15:31,942 --> 01:15:34,376
Ma, are you angry
at Mr. Books?

1337
01:15:34,445 --> 01:15:35,878
Why? What did he say?

1338
01:15:35,946 --> 01:15:37,311
Nothing. It's just...

1339
01:15:38,382 --> 01:15:39,815
Ma, I'm sorry.

1340
01:15:39,883 --> 01:15:42,818
I got to go run some
errands for Mr. Books.

1341
01:15:42,886 --> 01:15:44,319
I promised him.

1342
01:15:44,388 --> 01:15:45,412
Gillom.

1343
01:15:46,890 --> 01:15:47,822
Gillom.

1344
01:15:47,891 --> 01:15:50,621
I'll be back soon.
Soon as I can.

1345
01:16:00,604 --> 01:16:02,834
Oh! Oh!

1346
01:16:02,906 --> 01:16:05,340
What happened?
Are you all right?

1347
01:16:05,409 --> 01:16:06,842
I slipped in the tub.

1348
01:16:06,910 --> 01:16:08,343
Let me help you.

1349
01:16:08,412 --> 01:16:09,379
Hell.

1350
01:16:09,446 --> 01:16:12,347
Come on, now.
Hang on to me. That's it.

1351
01:16:12,416 --> 01:16:14,850
Now sit on the edge
of the tub.

1352
01:16:14,918 --> 01:16:16,351
I'll get you another towel.

1353
01:16:16,420 --> 01:16:17,352
Damn!

1354
01:16:17,421 --> 01:16:19,355
John Bernard,
you swear too much.

1355
01:16:19,423 --> 01:16:20,856
The hell I do.

1356
01:16:20,924 --> 01:16:22,357
Put your arm
around my shoulder.

1357
01:16:22,426 --> 01:16:25,020
Why didn't you
ask me to help you

1358
01:16:25,095 --> 01:16:26,357
in the first place?

1359
01:16:26,430 --> 01:16:27,362
I couldn't.

1360
01:16:27,431 --> 01:16:28,363
Why not?

1361
01:16:28,432 --> 01:16:30,366
I promised you
I wouldn't be a burden.

1362
01:16:30,434 --> 01:16:33,369
But you are, so let's
just forget about that.

1363
01:16:33,437 --> 01:16:35,371
I sure as hell am.

1364
01:16:35,439 --> 01:16:37,304
Oh, let me sit down.

1365
01:16:37,374 --> 01:16:41,811
Oh, sit down for a minute
while I catch my breath.

1366
01:16:41,879 --> 01:16:43,039
Oh...

1367
01:16:44,381 --> 01:16:48,784
well, we finally made it
through a full day

1368
01:16:48,852 --> 01:16:50,285
without having a fight.

1369
01:16:50,354 --> 01:16:53,289
Well, we haven't seen
each other all day.

1370
01:16:53,357 --> 01:16:54,790
You're right there.

1371
01:16:54,858 --> 01:16:56,849
You know, Bond,

1372
01:16:56,927 --> 01:16:59,327
you're such a real
lady on the outside.

1373
01:16:59,396 --> 01:17:02,832
You're full of vim and
vinegar on the inside.

1374
01:17:02,900 --> 01:17:05,835
I just never met
anybody like you.

1375
01:17:05,903 --> 01:17:07,336
You're running low.

1376
01:17:07,404 --> 01:17:10,840
I better call Dr. Hostetler
and order some more.

1377
01:17:10,908 --> 01:17:12,341
No. This'll do.

1378
01:17:12,409 --> 01:17:13,535
Oh.

1379
01:17:13,610 --> 01:17:16,340
<i>That Morning Appeal.</i>

1380
01:17:18,882 --> 01:17:21,009
I've skimmed newspapers
all my life.

1381
01:17:21,084 --> 01:17:23,518
Never got the whole
good out of one.

1382
01:17:23,587 --> 01:17:26,954
I bought this
the day I arrived,

1383
01:17:27,024 --> 01:17:28,355
and I said to myself,

1384
01:17:28,425 --> 01:17:32,361
"I'm going to read every
word, and when I'm done,

1385
01:17:32,429 --> 01:17:36,058
"I'll know for a fact
exactly what happened

1386
01:17:36,133 --> 01:17:39,296
on January 22nd
in the year 1901."

1387
01:17:39,369 --> 01:17:42,304
It was an important day
in my life,

1388
01:17:42,372 --> 01:17:43,805
and now I know.

1389
01:17:44,875 --> 01:17:47,810
Would you do me a favor

1390
01:17:47,878 --> 01:17:51,370
and give this honorable
incineration in my stove?

1391
01:17:54,718 --> 01:17:57,653
You're getting ready
to do something.

1392
01:17:57,721 --> 01:17:59,655
What makes you say that?

1393
01:18:02,392 --> 01:18:03,324
This...

1394
01:18:04,394 --> 01:18:05,520
dry cleaning...

1395
01:18:06,630 --> 01:18:08,723
laudanum...

1396
01:18:08,799 --> 01:18:09,788
haircut.

1397
01:18:09,866 --> 01:18:13,029
I want you
to promise me something.

1398
01:18:13,103 --> 01:18:18,302
Tomorrow when you see me in all
my dry-cleaning splendor

1399
01:18:18,375 --> 01:18:20,969
and my Sunday-go-to-meeting
clothes,

1400
01:18:21,044 --> 01:18:24,104
I want you to promise
there'll be no questions...

1401
01:18:25,916 --> 01:18:29,408
no surmises,
no woman's intuition.

1402
01:18:29,486 --> 01:18:33,718
All curiosity stops
right here and now.

1403
01:18:33,790 --> 01:18:35,018
Promise me?

1404
01:18:39,363 --> 01:18:41,695
And no tears, Bond.

1405
01:18:41,765 --> 01:18:44,529
Mr. Books!

1406
01:18:44,601 --> 01:18:46,933
In here, Gillom.

1407
01:18:47,004 --> 01:18:49,802
Oh, so I see.

1408
01:18:49,873 --> 01:18:51,306
No, you don't see.

1409
01:18:51,375 --> 01:18:53,775
I was helping Mr. Books
out of the bathtub.

1410
01:18:53,844 --> 01:18:54,776
What?

1411
01:18:54,845 --> 01:18:57,405
You must be hungry.

1412
01:18:57,481 --> 01:18:59,540
No, Ma. I'm fine.

1413
01:19:06,623 --> 01:19:07,817
I promise.

1414
01:19:08,892 --> 01:19:10,883
Thank you.

1415
01:19:25,409 --> 01:19:27,843
Well, sir,
I got it done.

1416
01:19:27,911 --> 01:19:30,345
Good. How'd you get
along with Old Dollar?

1417
01:19:30,414 --> 01:19:31,847
Oh, he's a great horse.

1418
01:19:31,915 --> 01:19:34,349
You should've seen the look
on Marshal Thibido's face

1419
01:19:34,418 --> 01:19:36,852
when I rode up
to the jail.

1420
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:40,356
He must've thought I was you
coming to bust Cobb out.

1421
01:19:40,424 --> 01:19:41,356
Hardly me.

1422
01:19:41,425 --> 01:19:43,359
Which is just about
what I did do

1423
01:19:43,427 --> 01:19:45,156
'cause Thibido's
going to let Cobb out

1424
01:19:45,228 --> 01:19:47,423
long enough to meet you.

1425
01:19:47,497 --> 01:19:48,429
Good.

1426
01:19:48,498 --> 01:19:51,467
You'll never guess
how Cobb took that.

1427
01:19:51,535 --> 01:19:53,264
I bet he jumped with joy.

1428
01:19:53,337 --> 01:19:57,740
He got all white,
scared to death.

1429
01:19:57,808 --> 01:19:58,740
Oh?

1430
01:20:00,444 --> 01:20:01,877
Now, Pulford was happy.

1431
01:20:01,945 --> 01:20:04,345
He really respects you.
He told me so.

1432
01:20:04,414 --> 01:20:07,645
And he sure was polite.
He said, uh,

1433
01:20:07,718 --> 01:20:10,881
"I eagerly await the
honor... and the privilege

1434
01:20:10,954 --> 01:20:14,515
of having him try his
luck at my faro table. "

1435
01:20:14,591 --> 01:20:17,526
We'll have
to give it a try.

1436
01:20:17,594 --> 01:20:22,258
Now, how about
the other fella... Sweeney?

1437
01:20:23,967 --> 01:20:26,902
You watch out
for him, Mr. Books.

1438
01:20:26,970 --> 01:20:29,905
That man is mean,
and he hates you.

1439
01:20:29,973 --> 01:20:33,409
Well, we'll see if we can't
clear that up tomorrow.

1440
01:20:33,477 --> 01:20:35,411
Sir, what's...

1441
01:20:35,479 --> 01:20:38,346
Thank you. We both
ought to get some sleep.

1442
01:20:38,415 --> 01:20:40,076
Can I ask you something?

1443
01:20:40,150 --> 01:20:42,550
I'm tuckered out.
We'll talk tomorrow.

1444
01:20:42,619 --> 01:20:46,055
But I have to be out
before sunup,

1445
01:20:46,123 --> 01:20:48,717
do the milk deliveries
while Cobb's in jail.

1446
01:20:48,792 --> 01:20:51,283
Then we'll both
have a busy morning.

1447
01:20:54,931 --> 01:20:57,365
Before you go...

1448
01:20:57,434 --> 01:21:00,369
there's something
I want to give you.

1449
01:21:00,437 --> 01:21:03,429
No, sir. No.
I won't take pay.

1450
01:21:03,507 --> 01:21:05,372
And I wouldn't offer it,
Gillom.

1451
01:21:05,442 --> 01:21:07,933
But you like Old Dollar,
don't you?

1452
01:21:08,011 --> 01:21:10,445
Best horse I ever rode.

1453
01:21:10,514 --> 01:21:13,449
Well, he's yours.
I bought him back.

1454
01:21:13,517 --> 01:21:14,848
Here's the bill of sale.

1455
01:21:14,918 --> 01:21:17,079
Now let me get
some sleep.

1456
01:21:25,829 --> 01:21:26,921
Sir?

1457
01:21:26,997 --> 01:21:28,021
Yeah?

1458
01:21:29,099 --> 01:21:31,761
When you asked me
to do this,

1459
01:21:31,835 --> 01:21:33,700
I- I didn't realize...

1460
01:21:34,971 --> 01:21:37,235
and... and I just hope
that nothing...

1461
01:21:37,307 --> 01:21:40,208
Just take good care
of Old Dollar.

1462
01:21:45,749 --> 01:21:47,239
Good night, sir.

1463
01:22:17,447 --> 01:22:18,379
Come in.

1464
01:22:19,449 --> 01:22:21,883
We got the headstone.
Mr. Beckum...

1465
01:22:21,952 --> 01:22:24,887
Good. Just put it there
on the bed.

1466
01:22:24,955 --> 01:22:28,391
Beckum said as how he done
the best he could,

1467
01:22:28,458 --> 01:22:30,392
but there weren't
much time.

1468
01:22:30,460 --> 01:22:32,394
Yeah, well,
that'll be all right.

1469
01:22:32,462 --> 01:22:33,895
Well, I'll be goldarned,

1470
01:22:33,964 --> 01:22:36,831
if they ain't gone
and left the date off.

1471
01:22:36,900 --> 01:22:38,333
That'll be all right.

1472
01:22:38,401 --> 01:22:39,333
Yes, sir.

1473
01:22:39,402 --> 01:22:40,334
Thank you.

1474
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:19,374
Early for you,
ain't it?

1475
01:23:19,442 --> 01:23:21,774
Yeah, well,
I'm expecting somebody.

1476
01:23:24,407 --> 01:23:27,672
Bring me a cup of coffee,
will you, Murray?

1477
01:23:27,744 --> 01:23:28,676
Sure.

1478
01:24:46,322 --> 01:24:47,687
John Bernard?

1479
01:24:48,792 --> 01:24:49,781
Oh.

1480
01:24:53,830 --> 01:24:55,889
How grand you look.

1481
01:24:55,965 --> 01:24:58,263
Thank you, Bond.

1482
01:24:58,334 --> 01:25:02,270
That dry-process cleaning
is very good, isn't it?

1483
01:25:02,338 --> 01:25:04,772
Yeah, but it's kind
of smelly.

1484
01:25:04,841 --> 01:25:06,274
Well, that's the naphtha.

1485
01:25:06,342 --> 01:25:08,139
Oh, this is my birthday.

1486
01:25:08,211 --> 01:25:13,114
I, uh, haven't been to
a saloon for a long time,

1487
01:25:13,183 --> 01:25:15,981
and I thought I'd get
a drink and celebrate.

1488
01:25:16,052 --> 01:25:18,316
Happy birthday.

1489
01:25:18,388 --> 01:25:20,549
Thank you.

1490
01:25:22,859 --> 01:25:26,090
You have
a beautiful day for it.

1491
01:25:26,162 --> 01:25:28,255
It's what we call
false spring.

1492
01:25:36,039 --> 01:25:38,405
Good-bye, Mrs. Rogers.

1493
01:25:39,809 --> 01:25:41,800
Good-bye, Mr. Books.

1494
01:26:08,838 --> 01:26:11,102
Well, boy,
here's your big chance.

1495
01:26:11,174 --> 01:26:12,766
Fame and fortune awaits.

1496
01:26:12,842 --> 01:26:16,300
After I put that old man
out of his misery,

1497
01:26:16,379 --> 01:26:17,971
I'm going to get you.

1498
01:26:18,047 --> 01:26:19,480
Sure, you will.

1499
01:26:21,417 --> 01:26:22,975
Don't wet your pants.

1500
01:26:24,354 --> 01:26:28,290
Marshal Thibido!
May I see you for a moment?

1501
01:26:34,130 --> 01:26:35,563
What's going on?

1502
01:26:35,632 --> 01:26:37,566
Shh! Dobkins,
this is law business,

1503
01:26:37,634 --> 01:26:39,727
not newspaper business.

1504
01:26:39,803 --> 01:26:43,239
<i>Adolph S. Ochs is the publisher
of the New York Times.</i>

1505
01:26:43,306 --> 01:26:45,240
He's asked me
for an article

1506
01:26:45,308 --> 01:26:47,242
on how city officials
are reacting

1507
01:26:47,310 --> 01:26:49,744
to the presence
of our famous shootist.

1508
01:26:49,813 --> 01:26:53,749
I was thinking of doing
a series of stories on you.

1509
01:26:53,817 --> 01:26:56,251
Whooee. Let's get
the hell off the street.

1510
01:26:56,319 --> 01:26:59,413
You tell them that's
Thibido with an "H."

1511
01:27:02,325 --> 01:27:03,587
Good morning.

1512
01:27:03,660 --> 01:27:05,093
Good morning,
Mr. Books.

1513
01:27:15,572 --> 01:27:19,770
You don't give a fella
very long to board this thing.

1514
01:27:19,843 --> 01:27:22,505
Got a schedule to keep.

1515
01:27:22,579 --> 01:27:24,945
Good morning.

1516
01:27:25,014 --> 01:27:26,447
Good morning, sir.

1517
01:27:26,516 --> 01:27:28,677
Isn't it
a beautiful day?

1518
01:27:30,186 --> 01:27:31,778
It sure is.

1519
01:27:33,690 --> 01:27:36,716
It's what we call
a false spring.

1520
01:28:35,685 --> 01:28:36,652
Yes, sir?

1521
01:28:42,091 --> 01:28:43,422
Glass.

1522
01:28:44,994 --> 01:28:46,723
Mr. Sweeney...

1523
01:28:46,796 --> 01:28:48,627
care to try your luck?

1524
01:28:50,934 --> 01:28:51,866
Hmm.

1525
01:29:23,766 --> 01:29:25,734
Hmm.

1526
01:30:06,625 --> 01:30:08,684
Whoa!

1527
01:30:10,262 --> 01:30:13,356
Friend... for you.

1528
01:30:13,431 --> 01:30:14,625
What?

1529
01:30:14,699 --> 01:30:17,497
Make you a little
more comfortable.

1530
01:30:17,569 --> 01:30:21,528
Well, sir, these old bones
surely thank you.

1531
01:30:24,809 --> 01:30:27,744
I sure hope the right
fella comes along.

1532
01:31:02,781 --> 01:31:04,373
Good morning, sir.

1533
01:31:04,449 --> 01:31:05,381
Good morning.

1534
01:31:05,450 --> 01:31:07,850
This is my birthday.

1535
01:31:07,919 --> 01:31:10,854
Give me the best
in the house.

1536
01:31:10,922 --> 01:31:11,854
Yes, sir.

1537
01:31:21,733 --> 01:31:23,223
Thank you, sir.

1538
01:32:49,053 --> 01:32:53,012
And I'll tell you
that was for Albert!

1539
01:34:46,304 --> 01:34:47,236
Look out!
