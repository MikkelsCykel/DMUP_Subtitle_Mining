00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,400
Right! Now!

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,400
This is Mr. Bennett, and he's going to be
taking the boys for football.

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,200
Mr. Bennett foolishly wants to be a teacher.

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,500
-Look at the fucking shell suit, man.
-Fucking wanker.

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,500
-I don't fucking believe it.
-Fucking yeah.

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,100
What you fucking looking at?

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,100
Er, less fucking and more attention please.

8
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:31,100
Something you might have said
to your boyfriend that, Gina.

9
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,200
Right, girls, onto the other pitch with me.
Come on.

10
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,600
-You, boy.  Why aren't you playing?
-Forgot me kit.

11
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,300
Don't make him play, sir,
he's shit.

12
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,700
Balls, Mr. Bennett!

13
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,900
Right.
Look, I want you joining in, yeah?

14
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:54,900
-You ain't playing, Gangel.
-Fuck off, McBride.

15
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,800
Ste! Come on.

16
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,300
Oi! What's his name?

17
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,500
Hugh, sir.  Hugh Janus.

18
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,700
Hugh Janus (Huge Anus),
get back here now!

19
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,700
Hugh Janus!

20
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:20,700
Janus, are you deaf?

21
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,500
Oright, Sandra?

22
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,500
Slag!

23
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,700
What happened?

24
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,700
-School burnt down, did it?
-Yeah.

25
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:42,200
Oh, what was it this time then?
IRA bomb?

26
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,200
-Fundamentalist Muslim Pyromaniacs.
-Oh funny that,

27
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,700
looked all right when I walked past it.
-Yeah. Funny that.

28
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,900
Look, you're not too old to be taken over my knee,
young man, d'you hear me?

29
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,200
-The whole o'bloody Thamesmead can hear you.
-Yeah, well..

30
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,100
-You have gotta start doing your games!!
-Why?

31
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,600
Coz you have, that's why!
-Who says?   -I says!

32
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,500
-I hate football!
-You never used to!

33
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,900
Well, I do now!

34
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,100
You know what I'm gonna do now, duntcha?

35
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:11,100
Juggle with 'em?

36
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,200
You know what they'll do, don't you!

37
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,000
They'll put you into care.  They'll say, 

38
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,300
'She's an unfit mother, bang 'im
into one o'them homes, coz I mean,

39
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,000
she can't even get him to do his PE.'
That's what they'll do.

40
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,700
She's throwing away everything I was saving
for me kids. Books, toys.

41
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:44,300
-I don't want kids.
-Kids are cunts.

42
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,500
-Anyone been calling you names?
-Like what?

43
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,300
-I dunno.  Stumpy?
-No.

44
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,900
-I told you it's stop.
-I know.

45
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,400
-I told you you'd grow.  You never take the
blindest bit o'notice of me, do you?

46
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,900
-I do!
-Oh yeah?

47
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:00,500
Well, how comes every Wednesday afternoon
without fail you're standing there?

48
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,500
-I've told you.
-Oh, have you!!

49
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Call the village band out.
Bid me goodbye.

50
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,600
-What you doing?
-Singing.

51
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,600
-What?
-I'm just a girl who can't say no!!

52
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,900
Heard of Mama Cass?

53
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,800
No, sing it.

54
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,900
-What?
-Go on.

55
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,900
-No way.
-I won't laugh.

56
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:31,200
Call the village band out.
Bid me goodbye.

57
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:37,100
Everyone stand outside and cry.

58
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:42,700
Never thought so many
Thought me so dear.

59
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,500
I'd be happy any place but here.

60
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,500
One way ticket take me anywhere,

61
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:59,300
Northbound, southbound,
I don't even care.

62
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:05,700
I know the grass is greener there.

63
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,900
Well, keep going!

64
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:15,900
-Might persuade him to get back to school!
-Libs!

65
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,700
-It's not natural, isn't it?
-What ain't?

66
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,200
For a girl her age to be into Mama Cass.

67
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,000
She's got a really beautiful voice!

68
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,400
And whassamatter with Madonna?!

69
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,500
She's a slag!

70
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,500
Hypocrite!

71
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,000
-Oright, Ste?!
-Ste!! Oright?

72
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Yous two been bunking off together,
have you?

73
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,800
Not together, no.

74
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,600
-Oright, Mrs. Gangel?
-Well, it's nice to see someone can stay at school for the full day.

75
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,400
-We had football today.
-It's the wrong season for football, innit?

76
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,700
-Student teacher.
-Ah, is that the problem?

77
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:50,000
-No.
-Well, what is then?!

78
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,900
-I best get in.
-Ah, Ste...

79
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,400
I'm doing the tea.

80
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,800
Stick it on, then come back out here.

81
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,000
Bubble and squeak, Leah.
You can't leave bubble and squeak.

82
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,700
Gotta watch it , like a hawk.

83
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,800
Don't that make you fart,
bubble and squeak?

84
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,600
Only if you've got a fat arse.

85
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,400
There was a phone-in this morning on Richard and Judy
about delinquent children. 

86
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,900
I shoulda rung in.

87
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,200
-I'm going in.
-See ya, Ste.

88
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,700
-Well, whose fault is it then? Eh?
-The system.

89
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:16,700
I am a victim of the education...thingamabob.

90
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,300
Wasteland.

91
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,000
You're a victim of your own big mouth more like.

92
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,100
Leah, love, get in here and
peel some taters for tea, will ya?

93
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,300
Kiss my arse.

94
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,900
You! Indoors,
she's a bad influence.

95
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,700
She's a bad influence!

96
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,300
-Right, you don't peel no taters
you don't get no tea.

97
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,700
Jamie!

98
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,200
Rainbow's gone anyway.

99
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:42,200
-That'll be the phone.
-Well, it wouldn't be the bloody Hoover bag, would it!

100
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,400
Yeah, I know.  I know Miss Chauhan.
But see, Miss Chauhan...

101
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,800
He's got a really funny tummy.
You know? 

102
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,800
I mean...he really wanted to do football today
but he got taken short, see.

103
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:05,900
And when he got to the boy's loos,
it was all locked up...inexplicably. 

104
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,500
So he had a little accident,
you know.

105
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,400
Yeah.  Yeah. I couldn't agree
with you more, Miss Chauhan.

106
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:19,400
I mean, when I was at school I was reserve captain
of the Under Sixteens' netball team,

107
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:24,100
so I can appreciate, yeah, the like,
value of exercise and sport.

108
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:29,100
I mean, I would hate you to think
this was any reflection on me myself.

109
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,800
I'm going to work.

110
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,100
There's a cheese salad in the fridge,
and the one with the beetroot's for Tony.

111
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,800
I don't need a babysitter.

112
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,600
I know what you need.

113
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,100
Shooting!

114
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,000
-I heard that!
-Yeah, well..

115
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,600
you could hear a zit burst in Australia,
you, couldn't you?

116
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,200
If you shot me you'd have to
go to prison and live off gruel.

117
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,900
Don't tempt me.

118
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:24,900
I'll be checking your homework
when I get in, so be warned.

119
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,300
Oi, Rose!

120
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,700

00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,200

00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,700
She's locked herself in her bloody room, ant she?

126
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,600
Leah!!!

127
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,300
-I'm on tablets, you know.
-Can I get in and try?

128
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,700
I give up.

129
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,700
Leah! Leah!

130
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,200
This is my idol!

131
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,100
Leah, love, spare a thought for
all the nice people who live round here!

132
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,200
Some of them don't like Mama Cass,
you know!

133
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,600
Well, they should!

134
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,000
Leah, please!

135
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Oh I suppose I should be glad
it's not techno...acidic...

136
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,800
housey housey...pop...trash.

137
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,500
Leah!!!

138
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,000
What's all the bloody noise?

139
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It's her, she can't control her kids!

140
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,300
I've only got the one, you know!

141
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,500
Just as bloody well!

142
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,000
Rose, turn that bleeding racket down,
will ya?

143
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,300
D'you think I'm enjoying this?

144
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:49,300
Leah!

145
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,200
Oi!  Mush!

146
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,200
Is that Trevor?

147
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:12,200
You only had to ask, Trevor.
You know I'd do anything for you.

148
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:16,000
Or..to you.

149
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,200
I wouldn't touch it with his.

150
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,200
See you later!

151
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,800
Thank you, Trevor.

152
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:51,900
Trevor!  Trevor!

153
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:02,300
Your mum told me straight, you know.

154
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:06,300
Problems.  Been there.

155
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:10,900
Walking cross the park, game going on,
my heart, you know, races.

156
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,500
Scared. Jamie.

157
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:18,500
Scared of the ball coming,
you know, near me.

158
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,300
Hey, we can fight this together.

159
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:26,600
Fancy a knockabout?

160
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:30,600
No, me neither.  But some time, yeah?

161
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:49,100
It looks like fried shite.

162
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,700
Trevor, make us a sandwich.

163
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:56,700
-But...
-Trevor!

164
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:01,100
Fuckin'ell!

165
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,200
I can't eat all that.

166
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,400
Where d'you meet my mum?

167
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,900
Planet earth.

168
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,300
Where?

169
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:14,300
Oh, you know, out and about,
here and there.

170
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,200
What's a place?

171
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:21,200
It's somewhere where, you know,
shit happens.

172
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,500
Yeah, but where?

173
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:29,500
Gateways.

174
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,700
She turn you on?

175
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,600
Sure.

176
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,500
She's thirty-five!

177
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:38,500
What's age? Age is just...

178
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,900
a number.  You know?

179
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,400
Mum said you was a painter.

180
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:48,400
I know why she chose you,
she needs the lounge done.

181
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,800
Only had it painted last  year.

182
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:55,800
Like that, my mum,
goes off things fast.

183
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:01,700
She might go off you.  Won't be laughing then, will you?

184
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:09,400
Is that a spliff?

185
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:13,900
Give us some.

186
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:20,100
-Hey.
-What?

187
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:24,100
Your mum's gonna be all right.

188
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,400
Dry Martini and lemonade please.

189
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,300
Pint o'Pilsner.

190
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:03,100
Lou?  Ho served her?

191
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:07,100
I dunno.

192
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,100
You.  Out! You're underage.

193
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,600
I'm only drinking Coke!

194
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,200
You'll be drinking blood
when I slap your face, now move it.

195
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,200
Oh, you're so hard.

196
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,300
Was that a threat?

197
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,800
Yeah, and here's another..

198
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,300
Get out before I call your childminder.

199
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,700
Oh, come on, Slasher.  I can't be arsed.

200
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,800
Slasher?  What d'you slash?
Crêpe paper?

201
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,000
He's incontinent!

202
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Sandra!!

203
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,000
Louise taking care of you, Mr. Barr?

204
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Of course..A word.

205
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,400
Jamie, how old are you?

206
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:00,100
Old enough.  How old are you?

207
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:04,100
Twenty-seven.
Not old enough to be your dad. Right?

208
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,300
What?

209
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,300
Sure...

210
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,300
What?

211
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:14,300
It's just..shit, innit?

212
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,500
What?

213
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:20,500
The whole..concept.  Yeah.

214
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,500
Anyway, I think we should just like..
move towards getting away from all that.

215
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:32,500
Right?

216
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:19,500
Please, Trevor, I'm sorry.

217
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,200
You'll breeze it, princess.  Unless
you really balls it up, the job's yours.

218
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:39,200
What sort of questions will they ask?

219
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,700
You're interviewing for a new barmaid.
You got three birds up for one job.

220
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:46,700
You say, 'If you find a fiver on the floor
at the end of the night, what d'you do with it?'

221
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:51,300
First bird goes, 'I'd hang onto it then ask
round the next night to see if anyone's lost it.'

222
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,000
Second bird goes, 'I'd out it in the till.'

223
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Third bird goes, I'd pocket it.
Finders keepers.' 

224
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,200
Who d'you give the job to?

225
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:06,200
The one with the biggest tits!

226
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:26,200
I'd bet me own flat..

227
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,900
be down Stringfellows every night.

228
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:32,900
I'd get a big drug problem. 

229
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:36,600
I'd get me own miniature poodle..

230
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:40,400
and I'd get a make-over. You could do
all that if you had your own pub.

231
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,200
I haven't even had the interview yet.

232
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,900
One of these days I'm going to
dripping in money, I am.

233
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:48,900
-Right, this is me.  See you tomorrow, babes.
-See you, love!

234
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,200
Ste?!

235
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:24,200
Ste..

236
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,400
I'm not going back there.

237
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I know, love.

238
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,300
Tony, make him a sandwich.

239
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,600
What?

240
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,000
Tony!

241
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,300
What's it to be?
Pastrami and fettuccine on rye?

242
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:09,300
Tony.
Just make him a sandwich please.

243
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:16,700
You'll have to top and tail with Jamie,
I'm afraid.

244
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:29,700
Ronnie!! Trevor?!
It's me Sandra!!

245
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:36,000
Your little Steven's round
at our place tonight.

246
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,400
I've every mind to report you Ronnie?
Are you listening to me?

247
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,800
This is Sandra here and I'm not happy!

248
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,200
Fuck off, you meddling cunt!!

249
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:48,200
This has got to stop!

250
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,700
What are you reading then?

251
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,500
Er, it's me mum's.

252
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,300
Oh, yeah? 
I've seen that in the shop.

253
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:01,300
-Hello!
-Hello!

254
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,100
-What bit you reading?
-It's about Sally from Coronation Street.

255
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,200
What, the blonde one?

256
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,800
Yeah.
Says her real name's Sally an' all.

257
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:12,800
-What, in real life as well as on the telly?
-Yeah, I hate that name.

258
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,100
D'you always wear glasses when you read?

259
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,500
-Supposed to.
-You don't in school.

260
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,200
-Hardly fetching, is it?
-Nah, looks all right.

261
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,100
Yeah?

262
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:30,100
Yeah, I'm telling ya.

263
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:33,000
-How's your sandwich?
-Cheese and salad.  Bang-on food.

264
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
-Good for your spots, that.
-That's right. Good for your spots an' all.

265
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,600
-You haven't got any spots.
-Yours are clearing up.

266
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:42,600
Cheers.

267
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,100
D'you fancy that Sally?

268
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:49,400
Not really.
Do you?

269
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:53,100
Haven't given it much thought really.

270
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,600
D'you fancy her next door?

271
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,700
-Fancy Leah?
-She fancies you.

272
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,200
- Don't!
-I'm only saying.

273
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,200
Jamie!

274
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,400
You goin' sleep?

275
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:21,400
-Yeah, I'm knackered.
-I'll turn the light off.

276
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,600
Ste?

277
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,000
Mm?

278
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,500
You oright?

279
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,700
Yeah.

280
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:05,700
Right.

281
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,800
Ste?

282
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,400
What?

283
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,800
Night.

284
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,800
Night, Jamie.

285
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:50,300
The second applicant says,
'I'd put it in the till.'

286
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:53,300
The third applicant says,
'I'd keep it for myself.'

287
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,400
'Finders keepers.'

288
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,300
To whom would you offer the job?

289
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:02,300
Well, it's obvious, innit?
The bird with the biggest tits.

290
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Though seriously I'd have to say
I'd be more keen on the third applicant.

291
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:18,800
At least I'd know
where I stood with her.

292
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,600
You have children, Mrs. Gangel?

293
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:24,600
That's an easy one.  Yeah, a son.
Jamie.  He's ever so nice.

294
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,500
I really fucked that up,
didn't I?

295
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:35,500
You'll hear soon, princess.

296
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:14,100
Yo!

297
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,500
Pervert.

298
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:25,500
Sorry?

299
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,600
I think you'll find the word pervert
is a serious no-no.

300
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:34,600
Anyone who goes out with that ole slapper
has to be a pervert.

301
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,800
Come again?

302
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,700
Your bird.

303
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,000
Sandra?

304
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,100
She talks to me like
I got cunt written on my forehead.

305
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:47,100
You shouldn't use words like bird.

306
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:55,500
You wanna watch yourself.
Sandra's got a reputation.

307
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:01,300
I'm saying nothing.

308
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,000
Anyone got a match?

309
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,600
Yeah, my arse your face.

310
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,600
Your arse ain't that nice, love.

311
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,900
Oh, grow up.

312
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:16,900
Oi! Linda Lusardi!
Get in here and cover yourself up!

313
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,600
Get us me ball back!

314
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:58,600
Get it yourself!

315
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,600
You okay today, Ste?

316
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,800
Yeah

317
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:09,800
I went to have a look at a new school today.
There's only twenty kids in the whole place.

318
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:14,300
There'll be twenty-two if you go.
You and Mama Cass.

319
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,100
-Is it residential?
-No.

320
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:19,000
Shame.
Coulda given you an 'and packing.

321
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,200
Coulda packed that fat bitch
and her music an'all.

322
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,700
You shouldn't speak ill of the dead!

323
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,800
Ere, shame how she died.

324
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,900
-How did she die?
-Choking on a sandwich!

325
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,100
Now you know why I tell you
not to gobble your chips down.

326
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,900
-Wasn't she heavily into drugs?
-Was she?

327
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,700
Well, if you're that fat,
drugs are a happy release.

328
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,500
She mighta been happy being fat!!

329
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:41,500
If she was so happy being fat, Jamie,
why did she die choking on a  sandwich?  Eh? 

330
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,600
Why wasn't it a walloping
great fry-up or somin'?

331
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,800
It mighta been a
bacon and egg sandwich.

332
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:50,000
No, it's coming to me now,

333
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,600
it was beef or chicken,
somin' definitely low in cholesterol.

334
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,300
-Hark at her, the fountain of all knowledge.
-Yeah, well

335
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:59,500
When you can keep up with the questions on
Bob's Full House you can get back to me, all right?

336
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:02,200
-I'm more of a Mastermind man.
-Liar!

337
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,200
Anyone see University Challenge
last week?

338
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,400
Me neither.

339
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:13,400
Tony, crack me open another one.

340
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:19,900
I fancy somin' wet dribbling down the back o'me gullet.
Whaddya say?

341
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,600
I say ditto, right.

342
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:28,200
You can say whatever you want, love.
Better in than out, d'you know what I mean?

343
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,900
-Oh, shut up!
-Oi! Manners!

344
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:34,100
-Me mother never taught me none.
-He makes me die, he does.

345
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,200
That is the intention.

346
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,900
Oh!  I bet you don't speak like that
to your ole man, eh, Ste?

347
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,800
I don't speak.  Full stop.

348
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,700
Oh, no offence, Ste.
D'you know what I mean?

349
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:45,200
-Mum!
-I gotta get in.

350
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,300
-You do that, Ste.
-Going boxing with me dad later.

351
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:52,300
What, can't enough of it, eh, Ste?

352
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:57,600
Nah. Spectating.

353
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,600
Weren't so funny when that bloke o'yours
beat you up, was it?

354
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,100
Oh, you're so clever,
aren't you?

355
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:14,300
Well, just remember, you,
I give you them brains, so think on.

356
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,900
I always thought
you'd had a lobotomy.

357
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:18,300
-What did he say?
-Explain it to her, Tony!

358
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:22,300
-Lobotomy?  It's when you split your...
-Yes!I know what it means, Tony!

359
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:27,900
I work all the hours God sends
just to keep you in insults.

360
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,200
If this was my pub
I'd have you barred.

361
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,700
Well, go on then.  Bar me, kick me out.
You wouldn't dare!

362
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:37,300
Oh, look at you.
Butter wouldn't melt.

363
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,200
But that's all right, Jamie.
I've got your number.

364
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,400
You got my number?
Well, I've got yours, Sandra.

365
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,100
So why don't you try and be
a bit more like a mother to me?

366
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,600
Oh, pull that one on me.

367
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,600
I'm a terrible mother
who don't know her arse from her elbow.

368
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,800
I never has a mother so
what do I know about bringing up kids?

369
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,300
I'm not surprised she abandoned you!

370
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:55,300
You skinny little bastard.

371
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:28,200
Am I like my dad?

372
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:32,200
No, you're like me.

373
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,200
How am I weird?

374
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,100
Give it a rest, Jamie.
Christ.

375
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:42,400
You said it.

376
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:46,200
You're all right.  Okay?

377
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:50,200
So you got me for a mother,
but who said life was easy?

378
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,000
You are.
You're all right.

379
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,600
D'you wanna come the boxing?

380
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,000
Shut up.

381
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
-Got a spare ticket.
-Leave me alone.

382
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:41,400
-You all right?
-Apparently.

383
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,800
They think I'm a piece of shit.

384
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,900
Jamie?

385
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:07,600
D'you wanna watch The Sound o'Music?

386
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:11,600
-It's on Sky, Jamie!
-We're goin' asleep!

387
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:15,800
OK.
Sorry, lads.

388
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:30,300
It's me mum's.
Body Shop.

389
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:35,300
Peppermint foot lotion.
Soothes your feet.

390
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:41,400
Lie down and I'll rub it into your back.
If you want.

391
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,600
Cold, innit?

392
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:27,600
Yeah.

393
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,200
I'm gonna work at the sports center.

394
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,000
Yeah?

395
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Do me shifts in the fitness pool,
do me shifts in the leisure pool.

396
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,100
I know I can do it.

397
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:51,800
You're a good swimmer.

398
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:55,800
You're on your own when you're swimming.

399
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,300
I'm gonna stink of mint.

400
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:14,300
-Peppermint.
-Peppermint.

401
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:24,500
Have you ever..kissed anyone?
And stuck your tongue in?

402
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Looking like this?

403
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,300
You ain't ugly.

404
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:37,200
They've made me ugly.

405
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:41,200
I don't think you're ugly.

406
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,900
Turn over, I'll do your front.

407
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:57,300
I can't.

408
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:01,300
I'm..I'm too sore. I'd make too much noise
and then your mum'd come in.

409
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:05,300
Jamie?  Sorry, love.
-Who played the baroness?

410
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:07,700
-Eleanor Parker.
-That's it!

411
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:11,700
I wanna show off to Tony.
Sorry, lads. Won't happen again.

412
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,900
-Turn the light off.
-No.

413
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:20,900
-Please.
-I don't wanna.

414
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,700
Can I come up that end with you?

415
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,500
-No.
-Please.

416
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:40,500
You stay where you are.

417
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:11,100
-Satisfied?
-Mm.  Night.

418
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:34,900
D'you think I'm queer?

419
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:38,900
Don't matter what I think.

420
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:52,300
Can I touch you?

421
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:57,700
I'm a bit sore.

422
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,400
Yeah.

423
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:55,000
-Great kid!
-Fuck off, I'm minding her for my cousin!

424
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Motherhood suits you!

425
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,400
Yeah, well, at least if I did get pregnant
I wouldn't get rid of it like...

426
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,900
some slappers I could mention.

427
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:06,900
Yeah, well, you're with the
black hole o'Thamesmead love, not me.

428
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:18,200
-Where you going?
-Out with me mates.

429
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,600
Jamie, you haven't got any mates.

430
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:24,600
-I'm going to a party.  I won't be late.
-I know.

431
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,600
Knocked around for you a few times.
Thought you might come round.

432
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:12,900
It's hot.  Bloody heat wave, Jamie,
and you expect me to be indoors?

433
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,900
No, it's just, you know,
just a bit weird.

434
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:18,000
I was out.  All right?
What's weird about that?

435
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,300
-Been worried about you.
-Don't be.

436
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:24,300
-Well, I was.
-Well, don't be!

437
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,600
Nothing's happened, yeah?
I'm all right. I'm pucker.

438
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,300
Everything, everything's pucker.

439
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:32,100
-You're black and blue.
-Give a rest, Jamie.

440
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:34,200
Oh, things getting better then, are they?
Daddy laid off the fist work?

441
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:37,700
-Or haven't you burned the tea lately?
-I said leave it out!

442
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:40,400
-You're scared.
-I ain't scared o'nothing.

443
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,200
-Yeah?
-Yeah!

444
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,800
Last week, right..
I went to Woolwich.

445
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:49,800
Coming out of this shop and there's this geezer in the gutter,
pissed out of his skull.  Lying there. 

446
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:54,300
And everyone was walking past him.
I had to step over him.

447
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,700
And it was my old man.

448
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:00,900
Got me to thinking on the bus.
Why be scared of a bloke who's dead to the world?

449
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:02,800
When he knocks ten different types o'shite
outta ya.

450
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,900
He's an embarrassment.
He's nothing more, he's nothing less.

451
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:08,900
-Why be scared o'that?
-Scared o'being called queer?

452
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,100
Are you?

453
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:18,100
Maybe.

454
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,300
Maybe not.

455
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:23,900
-And are you?
-Queer?

456
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:26,300
Gay?

457
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:29,700
I'm very happy.

458
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:33,700
I'm happy when I'm with you.

459
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,700
There, said it now.
Go on, piss yourself.

460
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:37,700
No.

461
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:39,000
Why not?
Don't you think it's funny?

462
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
I don't wanna.

463
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,600
I think it's hilarious.

464
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:45,600
Well, why aren't you laughing then?

465
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,900
D'you wanna come round tonight?

466
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:59,500
-Say somin'.
-I Can't.

467
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:03,500
Well, say no then.

468
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:16,300
Look. Let's get a drink, eh?

469
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:29,900
Scrub me back, Tony.

470
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Tony?

471
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:40,800
Tony, what's the matter?

472
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:48,600
Tony?

473
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:52,800
It's just..something Leah said.

474
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:54,400
Leah?

475
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,100
Right.  I'll look away.
Yous lot keep talking.

476
00:46:57,100 --> 00:47:00,000
-Then as a surprise, hit me over the head with the tongs.
-What?

477
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,300
-It's an experiment.
-Man, I'm wired.

478
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:05,200
I don't understand this,
d'you want me to hit you hard?

479
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:09,100
Yeah.
Ah here Ste, you do it, you're stronger than her.

480
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:11,400
-No!
-I can fuckin' do it!!

481
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:15,400
Come on.  Talk.

482
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:21,300
-I said talk!
-Is anybody else wired?

483
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:26,100
'Ere. Read this!

484
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,400
Mama Cass wasn't allowed to join the group because
Phillips didn't think her range was good enough for his songs.

485
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:35,000
But one day when Cass was decorating at home,
a lead pipe struck her on the head

486
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,400
-and when she recovered from the resultant concussion...
-Say it..

487
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:44,500
Lo and behold her voice had changed.

488
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:49,000
You twisted little bitch.

489
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:52,100
-How dare you say all those things to my fella?
-La-ah!

490
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:55,100
I lost that baby,
you venomous little cow!

491
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:57,900
You could never turn Tony's mind against me,
Leah, d'you hear me? 

492
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:01,600
Coz he sees you for the interfering
little slapper that you are.

493
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:04,200
-I wanted it to change.
-Yeah, well, some things never change.

494
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:05,300
I wanted it to change!

495
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:09,300
A leopard never changes it spots and
a slapper never changes her knickers.

496
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:14,900
-Be told.
-Man, I'm tripping.

497
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:15,800
Come on, Tony.

498
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:19,800
-Fancy a drink, babe?
-Have a wank, Big Bollocks!

499
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:24,400
Is that your mum, Gangel?
No wonder you're fuckin' nuts!

500
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,600
You shouldn't have said that
to Tony.

501
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:29,500
-Don't you start.
-Should I call an ambulance?

502
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:33,500
Call a vet, have it put down.

503
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:35,100
Hey Ste!
You got any of them Es left?

504
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:36,900
-No!
-Please, Steven!

505
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:39,500
-No way!
-Come on, Jay, let's go..

506
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:43,000
Give us an E.
Or I'll spread it round where you slept last week.

507
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,200
What?

508
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,600
-Dunno what you're talking about.
-He slept on the couch.

509
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:51,000
Not what I heard. Top to tail,
your mum said, very nice.

510
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,900
Take no notice, Ste.

511
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:55,100
-What would your dad say?
-Piss off, Leah!

512
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:56,600
-What would..your Trevor say?

513
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,000
-Leah!
-Try it!

514
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,300
-I don't like hitting girls!
-Oh, hit me then.  Go on.  Hit me.

515
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:05,300
-You stupid queer!
-Ste, come on.

516
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:14,700
Oi! Trevor already knows!

517
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:20,700
You know what them flats are like,
walls paper-thin!

518
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:23,700
Why d'you think he's been twatting
the face offa you, eh? He knows!

519
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:25,200
There's nothing to know!

520
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,100
-Top to tail?
-You know fuck all!

521
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:28,900
-Oh, really?
-Yeah, really.

522
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:32,900
But I know this much, I've been sticking up
for you. For the pair of you.

523
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:37,300
Told him I knew you'd slept on the couch,
told him I'd been in and seen. 

524
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:42,500
I goes, 'You shouldn't say things like that
about your own brother, they're just mates.'

525
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:44,200
Nothing happened.

526
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:46,400
-When was the last time your Trevor hit you?
-What's it to you?

527
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,100
-I bet it was Thursday.
-So?

528
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:52,100
You see, that's when I told him.
That's when I lied.

529
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:57,400
-Give her an E.
-Nah, it's all right.

530
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:01,400
I'm not after sympathy.

531
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,600
-We going then
-Are you fucking stupid or what?!

532
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:07,400
-Ste...
-Get your hands off of me!

533
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:11,400
-Ste!
-Get your fucking queer hands off of me!

534
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:38,300
-Oright?
-Oright.

535
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:40,900
-What you doing?
-Oh not a lot.

536
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:43,600
Claire's mum's got some vodka
back at their house, aint she, Claire?

537
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:45,800
-Yeah, half a bottle.
-We're going back there now.

538
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:48,800
Claire's mum works at the all-night garage.
Don't she, Claire?

539
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:52,500
Yeah.  Her name's Mary.

540
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:55,300
D'you fancy some vodka, Ste?

541
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:57,100
Oh, not really.

542
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:59,500
-Well then.  See ya.
-See ya.

543
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:03,500
Come on, Claire.

544
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:10,600
I suppose a shag's outs the question then?!

545
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,200
-I'm going now.
-All right, love.

546
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:47,200
Oi!

547
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:57,200
-What's his problem?
-Oh, he's in love, that's all.

548
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,300
No!

549
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:03,300
-Yeah, I'll see ya!
-See ya!  Wouldn't want to be ya!

550
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:12,800
How d'you fancy going to Greenwich?  The Park.
Legs astride the Meridian, as they say.

551
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:16,900
I gotta sort out the
week's rota for work.

552
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:19,600
You're addicted to that pub,
addict!

553
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:22,400
Don't knock it,
there's money to be made in booze.

554
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,600
Is that all you want outta life?

555
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:28,600
All I want is enough money to buy
a decent pair o'shoes that don't let in the rain.

556
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:32,000
-I can get you shoes.
-No, Tony, it's all right.

557
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:36,000
-I can make you shoes.
-Tony!

558
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:40,100
Right.
I'll do some hoovering or whatever.

559
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:43,800
-But I thought you said you wanted to go to the park!
-No problem.

560
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:46,100
-Yo, Ste!
-Oright?

561
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:49,000
'Ere, Ste.
Any beans to spill?

562
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,700
A little bird told me you're in love.

563
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:54,000
What?

564
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,600
Four-letter word love!

565
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:58,900
Oh, don't look so worried,
Jamie told me all about it.

566
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:01,700
She's jealous,
twenty years younger, could've been her.

567
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:05,700
-Come on, what's she like?
-Well, what's her name then?

568
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:10,100
-No!
-Oh, short for Nolene? Very Home and Away. 

569
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:14,300
It's about time too, you  deserve a bit o'luck,
coz you're all right, you are.

570
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:19,400
'Ere, buy Nolene a present with this.

571
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:23,100
-Get her some flowers.
-Sandra, I can't take your money.

572
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:27,100
Oh, I had a good night for tips last night,
go on.

573
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:35,700
It's for his bird.

574
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:39,700
Do you have to use words like that?
It really disempowers you.

575
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:57,700
Nolene busy tonight, was she?

576
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:17,500
Got you this.

577
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:32,700
My, what a pretty hat.
It's the prettiest hat I ever did see, Master Steven.

578
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:37,300
Does this mean we're engaged?

579
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:44,800
What?

580
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:23,300
Tony.

581
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:28,400
Sort me out.

582
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:45,000
It just don't feel right.  Here.
Your mum and Tony on the other side o'that door.

583
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:49,100
My ole man and Trevor next door. 

584
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:52,800
I got an aunty in Gravesend, thought
we could go there one night coz she's deaf. 

585
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:56,800
But that don't feel right either.

586
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:32,300
You cannot transmit the HIV virus
via frottage.

587
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:37,200
-What's frottage?
-Yoghurt.  It's French.

588
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:42,500
Dear Brian,
I am twenty-three, black, and gay.

589
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:46,500
I am happy being with a man, but get a horrible feeling that
people are going to talk about me behind my back,

590
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:49,300
and not accept me as I am.

591
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:53,300
Also, my family don't know.
Unhappy, north London.

592
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:57,300
Get over that river, mate.
I'll make you happy!

593
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:02,000
Find page ninety-two.

594
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:06,000
It's the bottom right-hand corner.

595
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:10,900
It's a pub.
One-eighty bus goes right to it.

596
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,800
So?

597
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:20,300
Look at that.
Isn't that beautiful?

598
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:22,600
You'd never get it through the front door.

599
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:26,100
Yeah, well, you never know when you're gonna be
living somewhere else do you?

600
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:27,900
That is a work of art.

601
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:30,200
Claude Monet couldna done better.

602
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:32,700
Get a life.

603
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:35,500
D'you know who Claude Monet is?

604
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:38,500
Jamie, don't make me out to be thick.

605
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:42,500
You just remember I won a year's supply of
toilet freshener for making up that poem.

606
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:47,800
That took brains and artistry,
that did.

607
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,300
Can you imagine it though?

608
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:57,300
Me and you with our feet up
on a cold winter's night?

609
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:02,100
-On that.
-Sandra!

610
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,700
Who was he then?

611
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:08,700
He painted the Sixteenth Chapel.

612
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:12,700
-And I haven't finished with you yet.
-Miss Chauhan.

613
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:16,700
-See ya!
-Have a cool time, kid!

614
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:20,700
You rung to talk about
my little git of a son?

615
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:57,000
You seen Jamie?!

616
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:14,600
I love you.  You're marvelous.
Well, Petra, I hope your leg gets better.

617
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:18,600
She still thinks she's in Baby Jane.

618
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:22,000
Fancy wheeling me round the back, mate?

619
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Excuse me, what's going on here?
Petra, dear?

620
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:32,900
Bit young for you, isn't she dear?
Looks like she's just out of Pampers.

621
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:36,000
Shut up, you.
What's your name, petal?

622
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,500
-Jamie.
-That's lovely.

623
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:43,500
Oh, Jamie, you make me feel like
I just wanna get my breast out to you.

624
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:48,700
I feel like chicken tonight!

625
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:53,800
So, Jamie, I think I'll have two of you,

626
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:57,100
and ten of your mate! Hello.

627
01:01:57,100 --> 01:02:01,100
Well, I've got my work cut out.
I'll see you after the break.  Trar.

628
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:07,800
Oh, don't you wish
your leg was better, Petra.

629
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:11,800
See you later!
Mothercare, here I come!

630
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:38,400
-Oright, Leah?
-Leah?  Who's Leah?

631
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:51,400
Had a nice night?

632
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:55,400
Yeah.

633
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:59,100
-Got pictures?
-Yeah.

634
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:02,700
-What, with Ste?
-Yeah.

635
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:05,000
This is no time for lying, Jamie!

636
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:08,300
It's not a lie!

637
01:04:08,300 --> 01:04:11,300
You went the Gloucester,
didn't you?

638
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:13,600
Look at me!

639
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:15,400
Only went for a drink.

640
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:16,900
That's where gay people go.

641
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:19,000
It's not just gay people go,
other people go.

642
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Oh, people like you?

643
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,700
Yeah.

644
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:26,500
-Miss Chauhan rang me today.
-That old bag?

645
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:29,200
-You never told me you kept getting hit!
-Everyone gets hit!

646
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:31,200
Oh..

647
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:35,200
and does everyone get called a
queer bent bastard and all then, do they?

648
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:45,000
-You're pissed.
-No I'm not.

649
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,200
You're pissed from a bloody gay bar.

650
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:52,100
-How d'you know it's gay anyway?
-Because it's got a bloody great pink neon arse outside of it.

651
01:04:52,100 --> 01:04:54,700
You been spying on me?

652
01:04:54,700 --> 01:04:56,300
No. Someone at work saw you go in.

653
01:04:56,300 --> 01:05:00,300
Well, it don't mean I'm gay.
They wanna mind their own business.

654
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:03,100
-That's what I said.
-Well, what you going on at me for then?

655
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:07,100
Because sometimes, Jamie, I can put
two and two together and make bloody four.

656
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:10,700
-I'm not bloody stupid, you know.
-I went for a drink.  Big deal.

657
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:12,900
-Everyone in my class goes drinking.
-Yeah

658
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:15,300
But they don't all go the bloody
Gloucester though, do they?

659
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:18,800
-Some of 'em take drugs, at least I'm not doing that.
-No, I bloody hope you're not!

660
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:22,000
Ah, well, thanks a lot. Thanks a bundle.
Go back to bed.

661
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:26,000
-I can't sleep, Jamie.
-Well, don't take it out on me.

662
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:29,300
-Will you just talk to me, Jamie?
-I'm knackered.

663
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:33,300
Jamie. Please.
Just talk to me.

664
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,600
What about?

665
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:39,600
I'm your mother.

666
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:50,300
Some things are just hard to say.

667
01:05:50,300 --> 01:05:54,300
I know. I know that.

668
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:58,200
You think I'm too young.
You think it's just a phase.

669
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:02,200
You think I'm gonna catch AIDS
and...and everything.

670
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:08,700
You know a lot about me, duntcha?

671
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:19,500
Don't cry.

672
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:27,000
It's oright.

673
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:46,600
I'm not gonna put you out in the morning
like an empty bottle. 

674
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:05,400
There was me goina bed of a night worried
coz you had to share a bed with Ste.

675
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:10,200
And all the time you were...
you were doing a seventy minus one.

676
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:22,800
I like the lad, Jamie.
But he hasn't seen any life.

677
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:27,300
-He's good to me.
-Is he?

678
01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:31,300
Yeah.

679
01:07:35,700 --> 01:07:38,500
-What have you done now?
-Nothing.

680
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:40,900
Then why's she so upset?

681
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:44,500
Coz I'm a queer!  A bender!  A pufter!  A nobshiner!

682
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:46,500
Coz I'm a queer!  A bender!  A pufter!  A nobshiner!
Brown hatter! Shirtflaplifter!

683
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:50,000
I...I get the picture.

684
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,400
Leave me alone.

685
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:56,400
-And she knows this?
-No, I thought I'd tell you first.

686
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:01,800
This is...it's...

687
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:07,900
It's cool.

688
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:13,400
Good night, kidder.

689
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:06,200
He was...

690
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:10,200
He was the most beautiful baby
in Bermondsey.

691
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:16,300
I used to push him round,
in a frilly hat,

692
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:20,300
in a big blue pram called
'Queen of the Road'.

693
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:24,300
None of that's changed.

694
01:09:29,700 --> 01:09:32,400
-You're fighting it, hon.
-Fighting?

695
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:36,200
I've been fighting all my life.

696
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:38,800
Kids picking on him. I was there.

697
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:42,700
Council saying bullocks to benefit.
I was there.

698
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:46,300
When I had three pee in my purse and an empty fridge,
I went robbing for that boy.

699
01:09:46,300 --> 01:09:50,300
So don't talk to me about fighting. 

700
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:54,300
You?  What have you ever had to
fight for in your life?

701
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:05,200
Thank you.
Thank you to all members of the Academy.

702
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:07,400
This award means so much to me.

703
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:11,200
I've never won anything
in my life before.

704
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:15,200
I'd like to thank my manager and my band.
But most of all...

705
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:18,800
-I'd like to thank one very special person.
-What the...

706
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:22,100
The woman from whom all energy flows.

707
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:25,400
This award is as much hers as mine.

708
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:29,400
The woman who gives me so much...
inspiration.

709
01:10:30,100 --> 01:10:32,800
-Let's hear it for her...Mama San!
-Leah.

710
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:35,500
-People say to me, they say...
-Leah, are you drunk?

711
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:38,900
-'Where d'you get your energy from?'
-Leah...it's two o'clock in the morning.

712
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:41,000
-And I say, "Hey...
-Has she taken something?

713
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
-Mama San.'
-Is your mother in?

714
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:47,000
Mama San, get on down, honey.
Your vibes are shooting through me now.

715
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:51,200
-Is she working nights?
-Don't ever let the light leave you, Mama San.

716
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:55,900
Rose! Leah, get your keys out.
Hurry up.

717
01:10:55,900 --> 01:10:58,000
Have you taken like a trip, you know?

718
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:02,000
-Jamie!  Leah, let me have your keys please.
-Don't shout at her.

719
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:05,300
-You're giving me bad vibes, Mama.
-She's on something.

720
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:07,500
Jamie!!

721
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:11,500
-You're an old man, and I don't like old men.
-That's cool, it's no problem.

722
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:15,300
Well, it is a problem actually, Tony,
don't pander to her

723
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:17,500
-What's going on?
-Rose?!

724
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:21,500
I saw a video about Woodstock once.

725
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Leah, get in here and
turn your bloody music down!

726
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:28,100
-Oh my God! Tony!
-Leah, what the...

727
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:30,800
-Bloody hell, Leah!
-Tony, get her down! Tony!

728
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:34,800
Leah.  Leah, have you taken a trip,
you know?

729
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,300
-Get down, you silly cow.
-Sandra!!

730
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:39,800
'Ere, body language, Tony!

731
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:42,800
-Oi!! You!! Pack it in, will ya!
-Oi!! Arsehole!! Fuck off!!

732
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:45,400
-There's no need for that y'arl hewer!!
-Oh, Jamie, help us!

733
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:48,000
-Betty, it's them again!
-I can see that.

734
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:51,400
Right?

735
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:55,400
-How am I supposed to sleep with that row going on?
-It's all right, babes, you're safe.

736
01:11:56,300 --> 01:11:58,900
-Oh, I'll be glad to get off this bloody estate.
-What?

737
01:11:58,900 --> 01:12:02,900
-I've been offered a job
if you must know.

738
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:07,900
Temporary licensee in a pub in Rotherhithe.
Nice little flat above it.

739
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:10,200
Thanks for telling me.

740
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:13,800
Snap!

741
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:15,900
-Leah?!
-Oh, leave the silly cow.

742
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:17,700
We can't just...

743
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:21,700
Tony! Tony!

744
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:28,200
Right, Jamie indoors.

745
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:31,400
Ste, she knows.

746
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:33,300
-Me mum knows.
-Oh why d'you have to go and grass?

747
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:35,600
-I never!
-Well, how comes she knows?

748
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:39,600
Because she never came down
with the last shower.

749
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:49,400
Jamie, get 'im a hanky.
There's a box of autumnal shades by me bed.

750
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:09,800
Leah!!

751
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:13,800
Mama Cass!!

752
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:22,400
I don't believe in secrets.

753
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:26,200
I like people to be
straight up and honest.

754
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:28,300
But I'm not fool.

755
01:13:28,300 --> 01:13:32,000
D'you think I want these flats infamous for child murder?
No. So I won't be telling your dad.

756
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
He'd kill me.

757
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
-Yeah, I just said that.
-No, he would!

758
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,700
Yeah, I think we've established that
already actually, Ste!

759
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:42,700
-They all would!  All of them!
-I'll bloody kill you in a minute if you don't stop sniveling and shut up!

760
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:54,500
You're a good lad.
And that's what counts.

761
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:59,400
And...somewhere..

762
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:03,400
-you'll find people that won't wanna kill you.
-No I won't.

763
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:06,400
-Well, you've found the Gloucester.
-I hate it.

764
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:10,400
-Well, somewhere else then, shut up.
-There aint nowhere else.

765
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:17,200
There is actually, Ste.

766
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:20,500
There's an island in the Mediterranean
