00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,196
You want it?

4
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,469
Is it yours?

5
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,516
No, not mine.

6
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,156
Yours.

7
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,231
How much do you want for it?

8
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,396
Whatever you think it's worth.

9
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,636
Exactly the figure I had in mind.

10
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,950
Take pleasure in it.

(Woman) 'Most nights,
this inner city emergency room

'it's as if death took a holiday.'

15
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,475
It's a mystery to me, a mystery how those
assholes at Assignment knew it.

This is Joey Summerskill,
for Channel 8, Emergency Room.

17
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,316
Very bored, no story,

18
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,152
no life,

19
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,435
really, really pissed off.

(Sighs)

21
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,350
Break it down, Doc, it's a wrap.

22
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,188
Joey, rein it in, kid.
They couldn't have known.

23
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,236
I know, I know.

24
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,356
It's just so... neat, isn't it?

25
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:13,150
My first gig that isn't kindergarten kids
or diet gurus is taken away from me.

26
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:18,113
Well, like you say, it's a mystery,
but that's all it is, a mystery.

27
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:23,672
Not malice. You really think the station
bought off every accident victim in the city?

'Hurry. We got an ambulance to beat.'

33
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,072
Better hurry, Doc.
A real story with a real reporter.

34
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,475
Joey, look, can I take you home?
I can go by your place.

35
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,916
You'll miss the money shots. No.
I'll catch a bus. Don't worry.

36
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,912
OK, but be careful.

37
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,357
And lighten up. The story of your life
could be around the corner.

38
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,836
It is the story of my life.

- Ever seen anything like this before?
- Sure.

43
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,393
Help me.

44
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,070
(Girl) It's got nothing to do with me.

45
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,669
What are you going to do?
Don't hurt him!

46

Oh, God!

47
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,589
Wait, I'm a reporter.
Tell me what happened.

- (Cries of pain)
- Sorry, you can't go in.

49
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,073
Wait! Wait, please. I need to talk to you.

50
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,755
I wasn't even with him!
Look, lady, I told you, it's not my problem.

51
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,796
I was just there, right?

52
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,836
- Where?
- The Boiler Room.

53
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:34,072
- Can I go now?
- What is the Boiler Room? Where is it?

54
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,309
(Crash)

55
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,396

See? This is what I mean.

65
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,432
Your technique, it's all wrong.

66
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,157
- What do you mean, technique?
- Hardly any thigh.

67

An inch more flesh, the boys upstairs get
hot - bingo, you're an anchorwoman.

This is TV. No pictures, no story.

73
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,596
There is a story out there.

You going to card me or what?

75
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,678
Sweetheart, you're not too young.
You're too straight.

76
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,911
Yeah, too straight for this shit.
You gonna let me in or what?

77

Yeah.

No, no, that's fine. Come now.

So what was your dream?

Oh, yeah.

- Well, I know what it is.
- What is it?

Why are you so interested?

- No, it's OK. It's my father.

Oh, right. Well, did he used to...

144
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,710
No, no, nothing like that, no.

145
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,473
He died before I was born. Vietnam.

146

We don't know the details,

147
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,191
but I dream of death and...

148
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,356
trying to save him.

It's... just, erm...

I don't dream. Never have.

153
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,154
Maybe it would help if I slept some time.

154

I'm just kidding.

155

No, it's just really neat for me
to hear about dreams. I'm jealous.

00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,630
have a night-time world.

161
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,237
Hey, this is great, isn't it?

162
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,276
I mean, just, er...

163
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,316
two girls, talking,

164
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,589
having a conversation.

165
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,636
Good coffee.

166
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:13,035
- You got a cigarette?
- Uh, yeah, just a second.

167
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,436
Great, thanks.

168
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,796
- Are you going to have one?
- I'm trying to quit.

169
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,672
Go on. What the fuck, huh?

170
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,513
Do you think you're going to live forever?

171
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,752
(Sighs)

172
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,436
Oh, you want to talk about that, huh?

173
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:51,638
Something awful happened to that boy
and I have to know what it was.

174
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,280
Look, I don't know anything, all right?

175
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,430
I come out of the club,
the kid's already lying in the street.

176
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,351
- Did you know him?
- No.

177
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,512
OK, I've seen him in the club
a couple of times.

178
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,956
He's a punkhead. I never really danced
with him or anything.

179
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,952
And he was a thief.
He must have taken it from a statue.

180
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,635
- Taken what?
- That thing.

181
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,831
He's lying in the street, moaning,
and pointing at it.

182
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,832
But the chains, where did they come from?

183
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,559
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

184
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,876
He said it came out of this.

185
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,916
(Man) So, when do you wanna go in?

186
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,436
Hey, hold on a sec.

187
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,236
All done, Mr Monroe.

188
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,036
Huh. What a dick.

189
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,431
Why are we here? Want a cigarette?

190
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,476
Sure.

191
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,636
(Thud)

192
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,036
(Clicking)

193
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,756
(Creaking)

194
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,277
Oh, what the...

195
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,316
(Rumbling)

196
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,516
(Clicking)

197
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,157
- Aargh! Aargh!
- (Squealing)

198
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,595
Get off!

199
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,068
- Aaargh!
- (Squealing)

200
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,233
Bitch!

201
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,276
(Squelching)

202
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,432
Whoa!

203
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,960
(Coughing)

204
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:28,477
- Did I sleep through an earthquake?
- I thought I'd make breakfast.

205
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,994
Oh, that's really nice of you, Terri.

206
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,434
Can I ask, is it always this exploratory?

207
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,476
Uh, I don't know.

208
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,757
It's my first time. I'm a kitchen virgin.

209
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,518
- I'll boil some water.
- No, I'll do it.

210
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:48,832
No, no, it's OK. I like boiling water.
It's a speciality of mine.

211
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,795
Look, why don't you go watch some...

212
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,836
some cartoons?

213
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,871
This is a really great place.

214
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,555
This is yours? You, like, own this?

215
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,119
Well, the bank owns it,
but I'm working on it.

216
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:15,872
I haven't even had a place of my own
since I was 15.

217
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,036
Ow, ow.

218
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,268
What a great view. This is a great view.
Would you look at this?

219
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:29,275
Well, actually I'm pretty familiar
with the view. But it is good.

220
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,035
You know, over to the left,
you can... see...

221
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,756
I love it here.

222
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,116
I have to solve this thing.

223
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,919
I have to find out what's going on.

224
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,912
- You mentioned a statue.
- Yeah, I found it.

225
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,470
- I knew he'd like it.
- Oh, wait a minute. He, who? The kid?

226
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,755
No, JP, my last boyfriend.

227
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,513
He owns a club.
You know, you were there.

228
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:00,593
- He bought the statue.
- That you found.

229
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,636
What do you mean, you found it?

230
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:07,236
Well, there's a store. It's really hip.
Lots of weird shit in there.

231
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:10,312
I don't know, I saw this statue pillar thing...

232
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,868
I knew he'd love it. You've seen the club.

233
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,474
Would you know the place
if you saw it again?

234
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,438
- Sure. Why?
- We're going shopping.

235
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:32,309
- Maybe they're closed today.
- (Man) Closed every day.

236
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,153
Owner's in Hawaii.
Been there about a month.

237
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:39,076
Bull. My boyfriend bought something here
last week.

238
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,912
Couldn't have.

239
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,594
- Are you sure?
- Sure. Lived here 20 years.

240
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,671
I see everything. Come on.

241
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,149
(Dog yelping and growling)

242
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,509
Dead end.

243
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,750
Still, there's a back door, right?

244
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,349
Five seconds, we're browsing.

245
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,438
Wow. I didn't think this place
would be like this.

246
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,875
These places are always all show.

247
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,428
Do you break into a lot of art galleries?

248
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,115
I break in anywhere if it's raining
and I need a place to sleep.

249
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,156
So what are we looking for?

250
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,959
Anything. Contacts, clues...

251
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,956
Anything.

252
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,791
Oh, this is going to take forever. (Sighs)

253
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,874
How much do you think
your ex paid for that?

254
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,349
Whatever it took. Why?

255
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,832
Because this place is a scam.

256
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:56,392
Half the stuff was picked up for pennies.
School art classes, bankruptcy sales...

257
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,755
And closed-down lunatic asylums.

258
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:02,719
Property of the Shanard Institute.

259
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,756
Hey, Joey.

260
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:08,674
- Yeah?
- Check it out.

261
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,035
It's the box. (Giggles)

262
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,914
(d Rock music)

263
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,792
Ooh, ouch, hubba, hubba...

264
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,479
Hi, baby.

265
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,394
- Welcome.
- You're JP Monroe, right?

266
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,357
- Right.
- And this is your club?

267
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,034
- Right again.
- Great club. I love it here.

268
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,634
- Thank you.
- Thank you for the rose.

269
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:17,714
That's a prize. You won it. I only award that
to a woman of exceptional beauty.

270
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,553
Lots of girls here
are better looking than I am.

271
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,870
No, no, no, no, no. Don't do that.

272
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,916
Don't put yourself down.

273
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,639
If you have a quality,
you should be proud of that.

274
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,632
Let that define you, whatever it is.

275
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,036
(Heavy breathing)

276
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,396
Aaargh!

277
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,474
(Laughing)

278
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,916
It's Joey Summerskill again.

279
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,993
For half an hour you've been dicking me
around about this tape.

280
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:55,073
I know it's late. I don't want to have
to get my station manager involved.

281
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,912
So, for the last time,

282
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,357
please get me whoever is in charge
of the Shanard video archives?

283
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,273
Thank you. Of course I'll hold.

284
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,989
Dr Fallan, how nice of you to take my call.

285
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,036
Can you hold on for a second?

286
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,076
Terri! What are you doing?

287
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,276
Can you just wait two seconds?

288
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,676
Dr Fallan, so sorry.

289
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,433
Michael? We need the Kirsty Cotton tape.

290
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,670
Your assistant has all the details.

291
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,716
OK, thanks a lot.

292
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,756
Bye-bye.

293
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,751
Yeah!

294
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,796
So, you got what you needed.

295
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,836
So, I guess we're all done.

296
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,876
So, uh...

297
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,916
So long.

298
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,956
Where will you go?

299
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:51,193
Look, you know there's a spare room
and you can always stay.

300
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:54,590
If you want.
You're more than welcome to, really.

301
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,156
Uh, wow, um...

302
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,236
That's great.

303
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,871
Um... I'll do breakfast.

304
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,472
So cool.

305
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,516
Radical.

306
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,516
Wow, you've got great taste.

307
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,196
This really says it, you know.

308
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:28,875
It's really... It's really dark.

309
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,916
- Don't you think?
- Mm-hm.

310
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,714
Do you mind me talking about your stuff?

311
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,756
Uh-uh.

312
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,796
If it bothers you, just say so.

313
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,917
- Doesn't bother me. I'm just not interested.
- Oh.

314
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,995
Like I'm not an interesting person?

315
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,111
But you gave me a rose.

316
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,192
And tomorrow,
I'll give one to somebody else.

317
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:56,957
Now, get dressed
and get out of here.

318
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,836
You shit.

319
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,388
Who do you think you are?

320
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,232
I'm JP Monroe, right?

321
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:08,233
You stupid bitch, give me back my shirt
and get the fuck out of my life.

322
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,276
I can't fucking believe you.

323
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:14,069
You bastard! You get me in here and...

324
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:17,277
Like you were at fucking gunpoint,
you stupid...

325
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,158
You think you're some goddam prince
or something!

326
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:25,796
With your shitty little kingdom out there
and all this ugly shit!

327
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,997
(Gasps)

328
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,270
(Whimpers)

329
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,319
Aaaargh!

330
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,112
Jesus Christ!

331
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,952
Not quite.

332
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:28,553
What did you see? The same as I?

333
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,189
Appetite sated, desire indulged,

334
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:35,829
a miniature of the world
and how it will succumb to us.

335
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,798
You enjoyed the girl.

336
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,592
Yes...

337
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,356
Good. So did I.

338
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,992
And that's all.

339
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,514
No, it's not the same.

340
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,592
I just know, what you did,
that was fucking evil.

341
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,398
(Laughs)

342
00:30:55,720 --> 00:31:01,158
Oh, how uncomfortable that word must feel
on your lips, "evil", "good."

343
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:05,916
There is no good, Monroe.
There is no evil. There is only flesh

344
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,390
and the patterns to which we submit it.

345
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,634
You will help me to...

346
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:17,350
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
No fucking way, man.

347
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,997
No fucking way.

348
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,156
Oh, how touching.

349
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:30,596
That is the gun you used to kill your parents.

350
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:37,069
I understand. Their fortune was so tempting,
their affection so conditional,

351
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,310
what else could you do?

352
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,356
Fuck you.

353
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,028
Now, can we talk sensibly?

354
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,917
(Whimpering)

355
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,236
No.

356
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,076
Don't flee from yourself.

357
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:05,836
If you have a quality, be proud of it.
Let it define you, whatever it is.

358
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,874
By helping me you will help yourself.

359
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,748
Oh, yes, you want to.

360
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,752
You always have.

361
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:20,037
With your paintings, your sculptures...

362
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,634
Look at these tawdry representations

363
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:27,510
and then imagine a world of the body
as canvas, the body as clay.

364
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,910
Your will and mine
as the brush and the knife.

365
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,355
(Man banging on door) Mr Monroe!

366
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,874
Mr Monroe, are you all right in there?

367
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:42,913
- Mr Monroe!
- There is a place at my right hand for you.

368
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,439
For a man of your tastes.

369
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:50,149
Tastes I can help you to indulge.

370
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,992
(Banging continues)

371
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,231
Flesh, power,

372
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,276
dominion.

373
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,316
Mr Monroe!

374
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,116
I heard some shots. Are you OK?

375
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,836
Everything's fine.

376
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,796
(d Rock music pounding)

377
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,792
How do we start?

378
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,394
It has already begun.

379
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,434
Hey, Joey.

380
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,988
Wait up. Where are you going?

381
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,595
Oh, I need to get some fresh air.
I've been stuck in the office all day.

382
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:47,756
This just came for you.
Something for your story?

383
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:51,273
Erm... I hope so.

384
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,238
This story, Joey, if I can help in any way,

385
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,039
you've got my number, all right?

386
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,872
OK. Thanks.

387
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,832
'I don't know what the box is,
but I know what it does.

388
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,956
'I've said all this before.

389
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,750
'I saw it open. I opened it.

390
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,954
'And I saw what came out.

00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:27,510
'I don't know what else to call them.
Demons.

392

'Demons live in the box.

'Look, I know you don't believe me.

395
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,796
'I know how it sounds.

00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,198
'What else? What else?

00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,434
(Sobs) 'Can you turn that fucking thing off?

'She's telling the truth, Joey.'

00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,272
'... and then they come, the demons.'

411
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,553
Man, Joey must have polished you up some.

412
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:12,280
She must be weirder than me.

413
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,356
(Phone)

414
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,392
Joey?

415
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,072
Not quite.

416
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,714
- JP?
- Alive and in the flesh.

417
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,189
How are you doing, baby?

418
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,714
- What do you want?
- I'm just concerned.

419
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,756
I'm just checking in.

420
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:10,594
- How did you get this number?
- Will you relax, honey?

421
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:14,389
Your girlfriend left cards all over the club,
remember?

422
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,597
'Uh, yeah. Well, I'm fine.'

423
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:21,352
Joey's going to get me a job
at the TV station,

424
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:26,275
and I'm meeting a lot of new people,
it's really great.

425
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:30,958
Now, come on. You can't tell me
you haven't thought about me.

426
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,077
Course I have. I mean, I've thought.

427
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,749
God, JP, you were really horrible.

428
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,798
I am a bad guy

429
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:45,714
but I try not to be, I really do,
and I really miss you.

430
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,196
I miss you, too.

431
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,670
Good. Why don't you come over here?

432
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:57,878
'Nothing heavy, just a little drink, maybe,
see how we both feel.'

433
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,916
No, I can't.

434
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,349
(Sobs) I just can't.

435
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,716
- (Phone)
- Shit!

436
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,076
Shit! Shit!

437
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:20,232
(Answerphone) 'This is Joey. Speak.'

438
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,550
(Man) 'Hey, Joey, congratulations.

439
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,916
'You may not have heard,
but you got that job in Monterey.

440

your condo.' (Laughing)

Terri?

00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,796
"Enjoy Monterey, you liar."

444
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,836
Thanks.

445
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,749
Hey, baby. Glad you could make it.

446
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,396
Come on in.

447
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,556
Not a good neighbourhood.

448
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,596
People disappear.

449
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,513
So, feel like home?
It's just like you left it, baby.

450
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,511
Not quite.

451
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,750
- That wasn't here.
- This?

452
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:29,593
Well, as you can see,
I'm having some work done on this.

453
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:34,674
You found a real treasure for me here.
I just hope I can show you how grateful I am.

454
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,716
Yeah? Well, it looks different.

455
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,473
A girl I know helped to smarten it up a bit.

456
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,915
She put her heart and soul into this.

457
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,956
(Laughing)

458
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,031
What a girl. Anyone I should know?

459
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:51,557
No. Honey, now that you're here,
it's like she doesn't even exist.

460
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,596
You know what I mean, right?

461
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,516
Yeah, right. Look, JP...

462
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,709
Terri, Terri, Terri, Terri...

463
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:03,031
You know it's got to be ticking away
in both our minds.

464
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:06,271
Is it going to happen,
isn't it going to happen?

465
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:10,990
Come on, baby. Come on. Come on.

466
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,714
You know we gotta get this out of the way.

467
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,155
Then we can relax. We can talk.

468
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:20,440
I don't think so.

469
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,516
- Not yet.
- (Sighs)

470
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,831
Sure. Sure, I understand.

471
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:30,796
- I'm just not ready yet.
- Registered.

472
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:34,236
It's cool. I mean, hey, we got all night, right?

473
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,674
(Groaning)

474
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,711
(Child crying)

475
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:54,108
(Men shouting)

476
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,430
Joey, welcome.

477
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,239
(Explosion, screaming)

478
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,432
(Screaming)

479
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,149
(Explosions)

480
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,755

483
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:09,554
What a bitch.

484
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:12,552
- (Sobbing)
- She was obviously just using you.

485
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:15,950
- She was ready to dump you...
- No!

486
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,996
She wouldn't.

487
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:21,072
- Come on.
- I must have done something wrong.

488
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,191
I tried, I just fucked up something...

489
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,236
You didn't fuck it up with me!

490
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:31,915
You know that and you know how sorry I am.

491
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,278
I'm sorry to see you upset like this.
God, I hate to see you in pain.

492
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:38,430
(Sobs) Really?

493
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:43,469
Yes, I just want to hug you.
I want to hold you, tell you it's all right.

494
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:49,637
No, no, no, baby.
It's better that you come to me.

495
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,755
It's not fair that I come there.

496
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,278
On the bed.

497
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,196
Come on over here.

498
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:01,596
Come to Daddy.

499
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:16,948
Come on... Come on...

500
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:22,192
No, I can't.

501
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:33,119
Bring her to me, boy.

502
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:36,997
You're really making this hard on yourself.

503
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,756
(Pinhead) Aaaargh!

504
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,596
Watch your head on the steps.

505
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,796
Aaaaargh!

506
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:03,036
Wait!

507
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:07,437
Why run, Terri? Why run?

508
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:10,876
Do you know where you are?

509
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,916
I'm...

510
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:16,318
I'm...

511
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,834
You are at the door to dreams, Terri.

512
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:23,749
Now, there are two keys in this room.

513
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:26,229
One is in the pocket of this fool.

514
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:29,676
You could take it out without me reaching
you...

515
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,716
probably,

516
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:35,236
and let yourself back
into that world you've always known,

517
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:39,277
banal, hopeless,

518
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:41,112
dreamless.

519
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,758
(Sobbing)

520
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:44,717
And the other?

521
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:48,110
The other? Oh, Terri,

522
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:51,112
the other is the key to dreams,

523
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:54,636
to black miracles and dark wonders.

524
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:59,149
Another life of unknown pleasures.

525
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,552
And it's yours, Terri.

526
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:05,030
Complete the pattern
and you solve the puzzle.

527
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,636
Turn the key.

528
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,312
Where is it?

529
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,995
It's lying bleeding at your feet.

530
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:20,073
Hell has no furies for a woman scorned.

531

(Sobbing)

535
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,676
Oh!

536
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:50,796

Talk.

556
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:29,316

Joey, how kind of you to come.

00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,915
Wait. Wait!

560
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:59,271
You have to help me.
I don't understand. Am I dreaming this?

561
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,956
You'll have to help me.

562
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:05,237
You will understand,
and, no, you're not dreaming.

563
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:12,189
Forgive me.
My name was Spencer, Elliott Spencer.

564
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:14,236
Captain.

565
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:16,595
Joey Summerskill.

566
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:21,595
Well done. Brave girl.

567
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:25,593
You've probably never shaken hands
with a ghost before. Am I right?

568
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:28,513
Captain Spencer, uh, Elliott...

569
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,875
what the hell is going on?

570
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:33,793
Hell is exactly what is going on, Joey,

571
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:35,791
and we have to stop it.

572
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:38,630
Will you walk with me a while?

573
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,952
A dream of one war is a dream of all wars.

574
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:46,672
Your dreams of finding your father
let me find you

575
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:50,958
and bring you to this place,
this limbo between Heaven and Hell.

576
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:55,238
I can't act in your world, Joey,
but you can.

577
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:57,709
What do you want me to do?

578
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:01,270
There is a monster out there, Joey,
and it's me.

579
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:05,518
The war pulled poetry out of some of us.

580
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:08,273
Others, it affected differently.

581
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:13,434
Oh, we're in India, by the way. And it's 1921.

582
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:15,511
I was like many survivors -

583
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:19,912
a lost soul with nothing left in which
to believe but gratification.

584
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,596
We'd seen God fail, you see.
So many dead.

585
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:27,911
For us, He too fall at Flanders.

'It found the monster within me.'

593
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:10,714
For decades, I served Hell
with no memory of my former life.

594
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:14,839
- I still don't...
- Monster as I was, I was bound by laws.

595
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:18,276
Hell has its commandments, too, you know.

596
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:22,512
The box had to be opened to let me out.
The truly innocent were safe,

597
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:25,114
until a friend released me.

Kirsty Cotton.

599
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,914
Yes, but if your soul was freed...

600
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,434
My evil was too strong.

601
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:45,436
'It hid,

602
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:48,159
'it waited.'

603
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:54,676
Well, no longer, Joey.

604
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:57,274
The shell of the beast has been fleshed.

605
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:02,915
What I was is out there in your world,

606
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:05,556
unbound,

607
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:08,716
unstoppable.

608
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:12,118
- Then what can we do?
- There is something we can do

609
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:14,156
but it will require great courage.

610
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:18,392
- I don't know that I have...
- You just stepped through your window

611
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:20,232
to another reality.

612
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:23,434
You're stronger than you think.

613
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:26,034
- Tell me what to do.
- There is a gateway to Hell

614
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:28,076
through which he can be taken back.

615
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:30,116
He wants to close that door forever.

616
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:32,156
Where is it?

617
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:35,869
Your apartment.

618
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:39,718
It's the box, Joey. He has to destroy it.

619
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:43,395
You must go back.
You must let him come for it.

620
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:47,439
You found the window, Joey.
Use the box to bring him through it.

621
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:52,753
Bring him here, to my dominion,
where I have power.

622
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:56,435
- But what if he takes the box from me?
- He can't.

623
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:58,876
It must be given to him

624
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:01,713
and that's where your courage will count.

625
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:03,756
Because, believe me,

626
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:06,115
he can be very persuasive

627
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:09,076
and very inventive.

(Pinhead) Oh, it's unbearable, isn't it?

687
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:52,952
The suffering of strangers,
the agony of friends.

688
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:58,832
There is a secret song
at the centre of the world, Joey,

689
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:02,674
and its sound is like razors through flesh.

690
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:04,512
I don't believe you.

691

Oh, come.

692
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:09,154
Oh, you can hear its faint echo right now.

693
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:14,036
I'm here to turn up the volume,

694
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:19,995
to press the stinking face of humanity into
the dark blood of its own secret heart.

695
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:22,958
And I'm here to stop you
and send you back to Hell.

696
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:26,510
(Laughs) Oh, no, you can't stop me, child,

697
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:28,955
but you don't have to hear the music.

698
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:33,992
Just give me the box
and I'll free you from the future.

699
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:36,036
Free yourself from the past.

700
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:38,076
Don't debate with me, girl!

701
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:41,948
Just come here and die, while you still have
the option of doing it quickly!

702
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:45,632
You're going to have to come and get me,
you ugly fuck!

703
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:49,394
Oh, spirited.

704
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:52,636
Oh, good.

705
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:55,154
Oh, very good.

706
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:59,314
Oh, I'll enjoy making you bleed

707
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:04,036
and I'll enjoy making you enjoy it.

(Sizzling)

713
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:06,472
Aaah!

(Whirring)

715
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,797
Oh, Doc, no.

716
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:10,313
Have you seen what he did to me,
you little bitch? Have you seen?

717
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:23,637
- (Screams)
- Where are you going?

718
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:25,597
- Run! Get out of here!
- Relax.

719
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:27,511
Everything's cool.

720
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:30,710
Whoa, what the fu...

721
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:35,352
Oooh!

722
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:37,635
Ready for your close-up, Joey?

723
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:55,396
(Taxi driver) No! Help!

724
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:02,637
Aaaargh!

725
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:06,116
(Whirring)

726
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:16,676
Aah!

727
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:33,276
(Gasps)

728
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:38,957

(Tyres screeching)

731
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:02,758
- Get the hell out of here!
- Just calm down...

732
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:05,400
- Shit!
- No, listen to me. Listen.

733
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:10,718
(Police officer) Freeze! I said, freeze!
(Joey) Run!

734
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:13,155
(Officer) Calm down, please.

735
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:15,196
(Whirring)

736
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:19,639
Shit! Get back!

737
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:26,749
Get down, lady!

738
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:33,233
Shit! Gasoline!

739
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:38,636
Run!

740
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:40,278
(Screaming)

741
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:47,596
(Whirring)

742
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:50,918
That's a wrap.

743
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:05,352
(Gasping)

744
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:29,477
My child, what's the matter?
What on earth's the matter?

745
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:32,677
I have to get him back to my apartment,
back to the window,

746
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:35,513
but they just keep coming,
they just keep coming.

747
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:38,876
- Who keeps coming?
- The demons. The demons.

748
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:43,431
Demons? Demons aren't real.
They're parables, metaphors.

749
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:46,753
(Doors creaking)

750
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:51,711
Then what the fuck is that?

751
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:56,996
Come on! Come on!

752
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:11,952
How dare you?

753
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:15,316
Thou shalt not bow down
before any graven image.

754
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:34,472
(Roars)

755
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:16,313
I am the way.

756
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:17,879
(Laughter)

757
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:24,509
No!

758
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,956
You'll burn in Hell for this!

759
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:36,275
Burn. Of such a limited imagination.

760
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:48,637
This is my body, this is my blood.

761
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:52,190
Happy are they who come to my supper.

762
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:57,958
(Squelching)

763
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:08,430
Come on. Come on and get it.
This is what you want.

764
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:15,628
- (Roars)
- (Coughing and retching)

765
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:38,717

766
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:43,110
(Rhythmic beeping)

767
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:58,590
I can dream now, Joey.

768
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:02,831
Oh, you wouldn't believe
what I can dream of now.

769
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:07,916
- Terri.
- Relax, baby.

770
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,911
This is better than sex.

771
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:25,031
- (Whimpers)
- Oh, yeah.

772
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:26,872
Oh, yeah.

773
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:30,951
Aah!

774
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:38,789
Aaah!

775
01:17:58,160 --> 01:18:00,720
They're hand-made, Joey.

776
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:04,349
The shadow of my former troops,
over-eager.

777
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:07,989
But let them play, hm?

778
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:10,548
Our game will come later.

779
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:16,829
Down the dark decades of your pain
this will seem like a memory of Heaven.

780
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:19,275
(Whirring)

781
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:28,189
Aaah. More friends
come to play with you, Joey.

782
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:37,480
Play with this, Pinhead.

783
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:42,271
- Aah!
- (Gasps)

784
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:00,960
(Roaring)

785
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:03,993
Aaargh!

786
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:18,195
(Sizzling)

787
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:20,748
(Screams)

788
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:35,151
Was that it, Elliott?

789
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:37,549
I didn't bring him through my window.

790
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:40,872
Elliott?

791
01:19:54,280 --> 01:19:56,236
(Birdsong)

792
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:27,553
Daddy?

793
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:33,795
I don't understand. I was somewhere else,
somewhere shining.

794
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:35,950
Somebody came to me and said,

795
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:38,634
"Your daughter's done well. Go to her."

796
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:42,872
- I don't understand.
- I do.

797
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:45,758
I do. It's a reward. Oh, Daddy.

798
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:47,796
(Sobbing)

799
01:20:52,160 --> 01:20:54,549
Joey, Joey.

800
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:57,313
- Is it you? Is it really you?
- Yes.

801
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:00,794
Joey, they said you'd have
something for me.

802
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:03,758
Something you won't need any more.

803
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:08,115
This. Here, take it.

804
01:21:16,160 --> 01:21:19,152
(Sobs) How did you know my name?

805
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:25,389
Thank you, Joey.

806
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:27,391
(Demonic laughter)

807
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:32,035
Ha, ha, ha, ha. Human dreams.

808
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:36,193
Such fertile ground
for sowing the seeds of torment.

809
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:40,790
You're so ripe, Joey,
and it's harvest time.

810
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:43,633
(Sobs) It isn't fair! You can't!

811
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:46,716
Save your tears.

812
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:49,314
I'll reap your sorrow, slowly.

813
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:54,518
I have centuries to discover
the things that make you whimper.

814
01:21:55,080 --> 01:21:56,957
Uhh!

815
01:21:58,160 --> 01:22:01,311
You bastard! You invaded my mind!

816
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:04,551
You think your night-time world
is closed to me?

817
01:22:04,640 --> 01:22:07,393
Your mind is so naked.

818
01:22:07,480 --> 01:22:12,349
A book that yearns to be read,
a door that begs to be opened.

819
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:15,748
A door. Window...

820
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:20,796
Window.

821
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:28,990
(Thunder)

822
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:31,994
Couldn't resist playing games, could you?

823
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:37,549
You had to come through
the window of her mind,

824
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:42,116
but now you're in my dominion.

825
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:45,033
And now...

826
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:47,076
we're going to Hell.

827
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:49,116
Ladies first.

828
01:22:56,160 --> 01:22:58,435
- No!
- You'll like her better this way.

829
01:22:58,520 --> 01:23:00,158
Trust me.

830
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:11,349
Why resist? You love this as much as I.

831
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,275
After all, you made me.

832
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:18,791
There is a world out there
waiting to yield to us.

833
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:23,829
So much flesh,
so many different pleasures.

834
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:26,995
(Muffled cries)

835
01:23:39,480 --> 01:23:42,552
(Screeching)

836
01:23:58,440 --> 01:24:00,749
(Creaking)

837
01:24:05,080 --> 01:24:06,274
(Muffled scream)

838
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:12,109
You're right. We do belong together.

839
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:15,992
(Whirring)

840
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:20,916
(Growls)

841
01:25:10,760 --> 01:25:13,320
Now, where were we?

842
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:24,198
Joey! Send me to Hell!

843
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:31,195
(Growling)

844
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:37,079
Aaah.

845
01:25:40,280 --> 01:25:42,236
Ha, ha, ha.

846
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:45,432
Go to Hell!

847
01:25:56,600 --> 01:25:58,318
