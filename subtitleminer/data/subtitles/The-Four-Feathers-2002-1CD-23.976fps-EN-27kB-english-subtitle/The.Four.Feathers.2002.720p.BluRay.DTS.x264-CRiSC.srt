1
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,043
Pass it left to Jack!

2
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:08,669
Pass the bloody thing,
Tom!

3
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:09,920
Tom, pass it left!

4
00:02:10,003 --> 00:02:11,755
Pass the ball!
Come on, Tom!

5
00:02:11,839 --> 00:02:12,422
To Jack!

6
00:02:12,548 --> 00:02:13,507
Go on, Tom!

7
00:02:18,512 --> 00:02:19,596
Tom!

8
00:02:21,223 --> 00:02:23,100
What's that man's name?!

9
00:02:28,188 --> 00:02:29,522
You see the girls, Jack?

10
00:02:32,901 --> 00:02:35,528
Push on!
Move it, boys! Come on!

11
00:02:37,614 --> 00:02:39,032
Stand tall!

12
00:02:39,074 --> 00:02:40,075
There you go... straight.

13
00:02:41,575 --> 00:02:42,409
Go on, Vicar!

14
00:02:42,535 --> 00:02:43,494
Sean! Sean!

15
00:02:47,957 --> 00:02:49,500
Go on... keep going!

16
00:03:04,973 --> 00:03:05,766
Break it up!

17
00:03:09,311 --> 00:03:10,729
I need you on the field, lad.

18
00:03:10,812 --> 00:03:11,980
- Huh?
- You're all right.

19
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,114
Behind you!

20
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,993
Jack!

21
00:03:25,994 --> 00:03:26,744
Take it, Jack!

22
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,136
Well done, old chap!

23
00:03:44,178 --> 00:03:45,137
Well done, Jack.

24
00:03:45,179 --> 00:03:47,431
Is there anything else left
in there?

25
00:03:59,151 --> 00:04:01,403
How long you going to be
in that bathtub, Vicar?

26
00:04:01,486 --> 00:04:02,404
As long as I like.

27
00:04:02,487 --> 00:04:04,906
Stand tall, Vicar.

28
00:04:07,783 --> 00:04:09,744
Idiot!

29
00:04:11,037 --> 00:04:12,914
Willoughby, you look wonderful,
darling.

30
00:04:12,997 --> 00:04:13,915
Princess Willoughby.

31
00:04:13,956 --> 00:04:14,957
Miss Willoughby.

32
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:16,542
Hey, Tom, there's a hair
out of place there, boy.

33
00:04:16,626 --> 00:04:18,795
When are you gentlemen
going to grow up?

34
00:04:18,878 --> 00:04:20,713
"Gentlemen"? Did he
just call us "gentlemen"?

35
00:04:20,797 --> 00:04:21,714
I believe he did.

36
00:04:21,798 --> 00:04:23,548
- I won't take that from anyone.
- Nor will I.

37
00:04:23,632 --> 00:04:26,134
I like when you do this.

38
00:04:26,218 --> 00:04:27,177
Not my hair!

39
00:04:27,261 --> 00:04:28,846
- Willoughby, this is...
- Not the hair!

40
00:04:28,929 --> 00:04:30,556
Not the hair!

41
00:04:34,351 --> 00:04:36,645
And don't think we're going
to take you any more seriously

42
00:04:36,687 --> 00:04:38,188
once you're promoted,
Miss Willoughby.

43
00:04:38,272 --> 00:04:39,690
- We'll see about that.
- Whoo!

44
00:04:39,772 --> 00:04:41,858
Ladies.

45
00:04:41,941 --> 00:04:43,943
Don't worry, Vicar,
they're only women.

46
00:04:43,985 --> 00:04:44,944
They won't bite.

47
00:04:44,986 --> 00:04:45,987
Just be quiet.

48
00:04:59,542 --> 00:05:00,668
Does it hurt?

49
00:05:00,751 --> 00:05:03,963
Uh... yes.

50
00:05:04,004 --> 00:05:05,339
What are you two lovebirds
laughing about?

51
00:05:05,423 --> 00:05:06,382
His eye.

52
00:05:06,424 --> 00:05:07,717
Don't fall for it.

53
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,010
He colors it in with a pen.

54
00:05:09,093 --> 00:05:11,512
I can draw you one
if you're feeling left out.

55
00:05:11,554 --> 00:05:13,680
Go on, then.

56
00:05:13,722 --> 00:05:15,182
What?

57
00:05:15,223 --> 00:05:18,477
Well, I want a black eye
like Jack's.

58
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,980
If you really want one, Harry,
I... can facilitate you.

59
00:05:22,064 --> 00:05:23,315
Want a second black eye, Jack?

60
00:05:23,398 --> 00:05:24,441
No.

61
00:05:28,612 --> 00:05:30,405
That's good.

62
00:05:48,422 --> 00:05:49,715
Are you nervous?

63
00:05:49,798 --> 00:05:50,883
Stop it.

64
00:05:50,924 --> 00:05:52,718
What?

65
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,303
What are you two doing?

66
00:05:54,386 --> 00:05:56,347
Nothing.

67
00:05:57,973 --> 00:06:00,059
I want to dance.

68
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,311
N- Not up there, Ethne.

69
00:06:02,394 --> 00:06:04,562
Now, Ethne, come down
from there, please.

70
00:06:04,604 --> 00:06:07,482
Not until you dance with me,
Harry.

71
00:06:07,565 --> 00:06:09,317
Oh, dear, yes, come down, Ethne.

72
00:06:09,401 --> 00:06:10,819
- For God's sake, be careful.
- Oh, please.

73
00:06:10,902 --> 00:06:11,903
Jack, tell her to get down.

74
00:06:11,945 --> 00:06:13,196
When does she ever listen to me?

75
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,407
Ethne, listen to Jack, please.

76
00:06:15,448 --> 00:06:16,616
Relax, Harry.

77
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,617
Listen to me.

78
00:06:17,701 --> 00:06:18,910
Thank you, Jack.

79
00:06:18,952 --> 00:06:19,953
I will not pirouette.

80
00:06:19,995 --> 00:06:21,246
Dance with me.

81
00:06:21,288 --> 00:06:22,288
Right, right.

82
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:27,585
- Oh, my God.
- Scary, isn't it, Harry?

83
00:06:27,668 --> 00:06:29,462
Don't be such a bore, Harry.

84
00:06:31,297 --> 00:06:32,215
I'm trying.

85
00:06:32,298 --> 00:06:33,216
Ooh! Ooh!

86
00:06:33,299 --> 00:06:35,093
Oh!

87
00:06:35,134 --> 00:06:35,927
Please be careful, okay?

88
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:37,261
It's not very funny, Ethne.

89
00:06:37,345 --> 00:06:38,553
Excuse me, Mr. Faversham, sir.

90
00:06:38,637 --> 00:06:43,600
Your father is asking
for you and Miss Eustace.

91
00:06:43,642 --> 00:06:44,893
Oh.

92
00:06:44,977 --> 00:06:46,353
Thank you.

93
00:06:50,858 --> 00:06:52,735
- Sir.
- Sir.

94
00:06:52,818 --> 00:06:53,736
Colonel Sutch.

95
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:54,737
Harry, my boy.

96
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:55,778
How are you, sir?

97
00:06:55,862 --> 00:06:56,821
Well, well. Mum.

98
00:06:56,904 --> 00:06:57,906
Colonel Sutch.

99
00:06:57,989 --> 00:06:59,908
I'm sorry to send for you,
my dear.

100
00:06:59,991 --> 00:07:02,368
I was hoping to steal you
for the last dance.

101
00:07:02,452 --> 00:07:04,370
It'd be my pleasure, General.

102
00:07:04,496 --> 00:07:07,123
Your son won't dance with me.

103
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:10,126
Where were you?

104
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:13,170
Catching a breath of air, sir.

105
00:07:18,175 --> 00:07:19,552
My dear.

106
00:07:25,349 --> 00:07:29,603
She is very beautiful, Harry.

107
00:07:29,686 --> 00:07:32,230
Yes, she is, sir.

108
00:07:32,314 --> 00:07:33,982
I was thinking how proud
my father would be

109
00:07:34,065 --> 00:07:35,025
if he were here.

110
00:07:35,066 --> 00:07:37,611
An officer who gave his life
for his country

111
00:07:37,694 --> 00:07:39,905
deserves far more respect
than I do.

112
00:07:39,988 --> 00:07:42,032
I wish I'd met him.

113
00:07:46,327 --> 00:07:48,788
Are you ready, my dear?

114
00:07:50,706 --> 00:07:52,542
With all my heart.

115
00:07:59,882 --> 00:08:02,844
My lords, ladies and gentlemen,
the general.

116
00:08:11,518 --> 00:08:14,021
Dr. Johnson once said

117
00:08:14,104 --> 00:08:16,482
every man feels meanly
about himself

118
00:08:16,565 --> 00:08:18,818
for not having been a soldier.

119
00:08:18,859 --> 00:08:22,112
Well, that's something
no one here tonight need fear.

120
00:08:22,195 --> 00:08:24,531
Whether or not you've seen
active service

121
00:08:24,614 --> 00:08:28,785
you have shown yourselves
willing to lay down your lives

122
00:08:28,868 --> 00:08:30,036
and for that...

123
00:08:30,078 --> 00:08:31,872
I salute you.

124
00:08:31,955 --> 00:08:35,542
- The Royal Cumbrians!
- The Royal Cumbrians!

125
00:08:40,254 --> 00:08:44,008
Now, in my mind, there is
only one sacrifice more noble

126
00:08:44,091 --> 00:08:46,928
than pledging one's life
for one's country

127
00:08:46,969 --> 00:08:51,349
and that is... loving...

128
00:08:51,432 --> 00:08:54,059
and marrying a man who does.

129
00:08:54,101 --> 00:08:55,060
- Marry?!
- Marry?!

130
00:08:55,102 --> 00:08:58,730
Harry... and Ethne.

131
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:00,274
Harry and Ethne!

132
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:05,529
Bravo!

133
00:09:05,612 --> 00:09:08,699
Bravo! Bravo!

134
00:09:24,464 --> 00:09:25,590
Form a square!

135
00:09:27,342 --> 00:09:28,801
Form a square!

136
00:10:29,193 --> 00:10:32,154
Well, now that we've had
such a public engagement

137
00:10:32,196 --> 00:10:34,698
can we have a nice,
quiet wedding, please?

138
00:10:34,782 --> 00:10:36,199
Not on your life!

139
00:10:36,241 --> 00:10:39,494
I want the full works,
the church near my home

140
00:10:39,536 --> 00:10:42,622
and then a rousing speech
from your father.

141
00:10:42,664 --> 00:10:43,999
Mm.

142
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,000
My father?

143
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:46,167
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

144
00:10:46,209 --> 00:10:48,503
"I'd like
to congratulate my son.

145
00:10:48,545 --> 00:10:52,507
When I was his age, I was
in charge of a full regiment. "

146
00:10:52,591 --> 00:10:54,133
He doesn't sound
anything like that.

147
00:10:54,216 --> 00:10:55,134
Oh, yes, he does.

148
00:10:55,217 --> 00:10:57,511
Besides, you will be
in charge of a regiment.

149
00:11:04,435 --> 00:11:05,853
Quiet!

150
00:11:05,895 --> 00:11:06,938
It'll be Jack and Isabelle's
turn next.

151
00:11:07,021 --> 00:11:08,856
Jack? Oh, no,
Jack will never get married.

152
00:11:08,898 --> 00:11:10,148
He's too much of a soldier.

153
00:11:10,232 --> 00:11:11,024
So are you.

154
00:11:11,108 --> 00:11:13,151
Yes, but not like him.

155
00:11:13,235 --> 00:11:17,531
Yes, you are, more than him,
more than any of them.

156
00:11:17,614 --> 00:11:19,825
You're my husband.

157
00:11:19,908 --> 00:11:21,535
Good night, ladies

158
00:11:21,618 --> 00:11:23,787
Good night, ladies...

159
00:11:23,871 --> 00:11:24,955
Go away.

160
00:11:25,038 --> 00:11:26,206
Please, ignore them.

161
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:27,749
Don't act like children!

162
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:31,377
Merrily, we roll along,
roll along, roll along

163
00:11:31,419 --> 00:11:34,380
Merrily, we roll along
until the morning comes

164
00:11:34,422 --> 00:11:37,800
Good night, gentlemen,
good night, gentlemen...

165
00:11:37,884 --> 00:11:39,803
Good night, Ethne!

166
00:11:39,886 --> 00:11:42,222
Good night, Harry!

167
00:11:42,263 --> 00:11:46,266
Good night, Ethne,
we have to take him home!

168
00:11:52,106 --> 00:11:53,566
Hyah! Hyah!

169
00:11:59,947 --> 00:12:01,990
Come on, Harry, keep up!

170
00:12:03,909 --> 00:12:05,869
Come on, John!

171
00:12:17,255 --> 00:12:20,091
Come on, Mr. Castleton,
get it out!

172
00:12:20,132 --> 00:12:21,259
Mr. Trench, carry on!

173
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,178
Mr. Castleton's dead...
enemy spear through the foot!

174
00:12:24,262 --> 00:12:25,263
Come on, get a move on!

175
00:12:25,346 --> 00:12:26,764
Get it out!

176
00:12:28,307 --> 00:12:30,476
Come on, let's go! Come on!

177
00:12:41,904 --> 00:12:44,198
Gentlemen, the colonel!

178
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,417
Gentlemen.

179
00:12:57,669 --> 00:12:58,795
I have some news.

180
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:03,466
An army of Muhammadan fanatics
under the command

181
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:07,637
of their self-proclaimed
messiah, the Mahdi

182
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:12,057
has attacked a British fortress
in the Sudan.

183
00:13:12,141 --> 00:13:14,477
Our forces there fought a heroic

184
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,688
but in the end hopeless,
rearguard action.

185
00:13:19,482 --> 00:13:22,902
They were slaughtered to a man.

186
00:13:22,985 --> 00:13:26,238
As a result of these hostilities

187
00:13:26,321 --> 00:13:31,159
several regiments,
including the Royal Cumbrians

188
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:35,330
will be shipping out
to the Sudan within the week.

189
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:38,500
Congratulations to you all.

190
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:42,670
This government
has finally seen fit

191
00:13:42,712 --> 00:13:44,464
to send its soldiers to war.

192
00:13:51,346 --> 00:13:52,513
Finally, we're off.

193
00:13:54,265 --> 00:13:55,433
Gentlemen.

194
00:13:58,269 --> 00:14:02,356
God has endowed

195
00:14:02,439 --> 00:14:04,274
the British race

196
00:14:04,358 --> 00:14:07,027
with a worldwide empire

197
00:14:07,111 --> 00:14:09,864
that they may execute

198
00:14:09,905 --> 00:14:12,700
His sovereign purpose
in the world.

199
00:14:12,783 --> 00:14:15,369
The victories you will have
over the heathen

200
00:14:15,536 --> 00:14:22,000
are the victories
of the nobler soul in man.

201
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:26,171
- God save the queen.
- God save the queen!

202
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:37,014
All together!

203
00:14:37,098 --> 00:14:40,309
This is what nerves do
to grown men.

204
00:14:40,393 --> 00:14:44,730
If we're going to go to war,
I wish we'd just get on with it.

205
00:14:44,772 --> 00:14:47,358
Do you ever think
about what it's going to be like

206
00:14:47,483 --> 00:14:49,652
when we get there?

207
00:14:49,736 --> 00:14:51,695
All the time.

208
00:14:51,778 --> 00:14:53,363
Don't you?

209
00:14:53,447 --> 00:14:55,073
I sometimes wonder

210
00:14:55,115 --> 00:14:58,327
what a godforsaken desert
in the middle of nowhere

211
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:00,120
has to do
with Her Majesty the queen.

212
00:15:02,956 --> 00:15:04,249
What's going on?

213
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:05,292
What happened?

214
00:15:05,334 --> 00:15:08,086
Aren't you afraid
you won't come back?

215
00:15:08,169 --> 00:15:12,590
Did you have a bad dream
about me or something?

216
00:15:12,632 --> 00:15:15,593
Did I get my head lopped off
by one of those Mahdi savages?

217
00:15:15,677 --> 00:15:18,179
Yes, Jack.

218
00:15:18,263 --> 00:15:19,931
Of course, I'm scared.

219
00:15:19,973 --> 00:15:22,434
Then, what...

220
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:26,604
...what makes you go?

221
00:15:26,687 --> 00:15:30,941
I suppose... I'm going

222
00:15:30,983 --> 00:15:32,318
because you're going...

223
00:15:32,443 --> 00:15:37,114
you, Trench, Castleton,
even Willoughby...

224
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:39,825
but especially you.

225
00:15:41,868 --> 00:15:44,871
There's no one
I'd sooner trust my life with.

226
00:16:44,179 --> 00:16:45,138
What is this?

227
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,099
My papers, sir.

228
00:16:47,182 --> 00:16:50,351
If it's leave you want,
there's a different procedure.

229
00:16:50,434 --> 00:16:53,521
Normally I wouldn't consider it
in the circumstances

230
00:16:53,604 --> 00:16:55,856
but given that you've
just got engaged...

231
00:16:55,898 --> 00:16:57,024
It isn't leave I want, sir.

232
00:17:00,528 --> 00:17:02,739
I wish to resign my commission.

233
00:17:08,368 --> 00:17:10,829
If I were you,
I'd think very carefully

234
00:17:10,913 --> 00:17:13,290
about what
you're saying, Lieutenant.

235
00:17:13,373 --> 00:17:15,793
I've made up my mind, sir.

236
00:17:15,876 --> 00:17:20,547
We'll talk about this when
you've spoken with your father.

237
00:17:20,631 --> 00:17:24,300
It isn't his decision, sir.

238
00:17:24,384 --> 00:17:27,554
I do not accept
these papers, Lieutenant

239
00:17:27,595 --> 00:17:29,889
and I do not accept
that one of my men

240
00:17:29,931 --> 00:17:31,182
would walk out
on his regiment...

241
00:17:31,266 --> 00:17:32,308
- Sir...
... the very week

242
00:17:32,434 --> 00:17:33,935
we are shipping off to war!

243
00:17:38,398 --> 00:17:42,651
Now, as far as I'm concerned,
you were never here.

244
00:17:42,735 --> 00:17:45,488
You can thank
your father for that.

245
00:17:47,531 --> 00:17:48,616
Sir...

246
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:55,456
I wish to resign my commission.

247
00:18:00,085 --> 00:18:02,587
Please leave
these barracks immediately.

248
00:18:26,277 --> 00:18:27,987
Whoa!

249
00:18:31,657 --> 00:18:34,410
Hello, Miss Willoughby!

250
00:18:34,493 --> 00:18:36,078
I thought I could smell

251
00:18:36,161 --> 00:18:38,664
the scent of fresh roses
in the air.

252
00:18:38,747 --> 00:18:39,999
Harry's resigned.

253
00:18:40,082 --> 00:18:41,125
Resigned what?

254
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:42,960
His bloody commission,
what do you think?

255
00:18:45,671 --> 00:18:47,089
What did Hamilton do?

256
00:18:47,173 --> 00:18:48,757
Refuse him leave to marry Ethne?

257
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,216
Hamilton didn't do anything.

258
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,634
There was no excuse for it.

259
00:18:51,718 --> 00:18:52,802
"Excuse for it"?

260
00:18:52,886 --> 00:18:54,429
You're talking about Harry.

261
00:18:54,512 --> 00:18:56,222
He's right, Tom.
He's just got engaged.

262
00:18:56,306 --> 00:18:58,016
It's perfectly natural
to have doubts.

263
00:18:58,099 --> 00:19:00,977
We're sent to war, and
the very next day he resigns?

264
00:19:01,019 --> 00:19:02,521
There's no doubt about it.

265
00:19:02,562 --> 00:19:03,814
What's that supposed to mean?

266
00:19:03,897 --> 00:19:04,980
I think it's perfectly clear
what it means.

267
00:19:05,022 --> 00:19:06,649
- Tom, don't be absurd.
- Shut up, Vicar.

268
00:19:06,732 --> 00:19:08,192
It means he's a coward, Jack.

269
00:19:13,364 --> 00:19:15,324
Then say that to his face.

270
00:19:15,449 --> 00:19:16,576
I would've done

271
00:19:16,659 --> 00:19:19,120
only he left the barracks
before I had a chance.

272
00:19:19,203 --> 00:19:21,496
All right, then,
say it to my face.

273
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,748
Easy, Jack.

274
00:19:26,543 --> 00:19:27,836
Harry's a disgrace!

275
00:19:28,962 --> 00:19:31,089
He's disgraced the regiment!

276
00:19:31,173 --> 00:19:31,965
Jack!

277
00:19:32,049 --> 00:19:33,592
He's the best soldier
in the regiment!

278
00:19:33,675 --> 00:19:35,761
Obviously not when it counts.

279
00:19:38,305 --> 00:19:39,430
Get off!

280
00:19:40,431 --> 00:19:42,308
I will tell him

281
00:19:42,433 --> 00:19:44,561
but not to his face...
he doesn't deserve it.

282
00:19:44,644 --> 00:19:45,812
He deserves to be treated

283
00:19:45,895 --> 00:19:47,981
with the same contempt
that he treated us.

284
00:19:48,022 --> 00:19:48,982
What contempt?

285
00:19:49,023 --> 00:19:50,191
Did he talk to you about it?

286
00:19:50,233 --> 00:19:53,903
Did he talk to any of you?

287
00:19:53,987 --> 00:19:55,113
He's left our backs exposed

288
00:19:55,196 --> 00:19:57,197
and he doesn't even have
the courage to tell us.

289
00:20:04,914 --> 00:20:06,582
He was my friend, too, Jack.

290
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:16,216
He'll be there.

291
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,685
This has to be answered.

292
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,872
Do you, Harry Faversham

293
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:53,085
take this woman to be
your lawful, wedded wife?

294
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:55,671
Yes, and you may kiss the bride.

295
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:56,922
You can't jump ahead like that.

296
00:20:57,006 --> 00:20:58,382
You have to let me enjoy
my wedding.

297
00:20:58,507 --> 00:20:59,383
Oh.

298
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,260
It's your fault we won't be able

299
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:03,678
to do the real one
for another six months.

300
00:21:03,761 --> 00:21:05,472
There's no reason why
we can't get married

301
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:06,639
whenever we like, is there?

302
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:07,682
I've heard that before.

303
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:10,060
I've left the army.

304
00:21:12,103 --> 00:21:16,441
No, Ethne, I...
I have... left the army.

305
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,031
Why?

306
00:21:28,452 --> 00:21:33,791
Well, there was talk
they may send us abroad...

307
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:35,835
for a year or two.

308
00:21:39,421 --> 00:21:42,132
I didn't want to wait that long
to get married.

309
00:21:42,174 --> 00:21:46,345
Well, I would've waited...

310
00:21:46,428 --> 00:21:48,347
or come with you.

311
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:50,724
My mother did the same
for my father.

312
00:21:50,808 --> 00:21:53,936
Yes, I know, but it isn't
what I wanted for us.

313
00:21:56,938 --> 00:21:59,857
You're all that matters
to me now.

314
00:22:02,485 --> 00:22:04,529
Where were they going
to send you?

315
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,827
They weren't sure.

316
00:22:18,042 --> 00:22:19,877
Mr. Faversham.

317
00:23:10,426 --> 00:23:13,679
Is this your friends' idea
of a joke?

318
00:23:13,762 --> 00:23:15,723
What is it, Harry?

319
00:23:20,727 --> 00:23:22,645
Feathers of... of cowardice.

320
00:23:24,939 --> 00:23:28,026
Yesterday, we... were informed

321
00:23:28,109 --> 00:23:30,320
that our regiment
would be shipping out

322
00:23:30,403 --> 00:23:32,405
to the Sudan...

323
00:23:34,407 --> 00:23:37,576
...that we would be...
sent to war.

324
00:23:37,618 --> 00:23:39,745
You don't know where
they were sending you...

325
00:23:39,829 --> 00:23:42,415
you said so yourself...
and you did it for me.

326
00:23:42,498 --> 00:23:44,000
- Ethne...
- Nobody in their right minds

327
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:46,711
could call you a coward,
especially not your friends.

328
00:23:46,794 --> 00:23:48,921
There's been some kind
of misunderstanding.

329
00:23:49,005 --> 00:23:50,923
You have to clear it up.

330
00:23:50,965 --> 00:23:53,216
You have to go back
to the regiment and clear it up.

331
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,217
No, I can't.

332
00:23:54,301 --> 00:23:55,343
Then I will.

333
00:23:55,427 --> 00:23:58,930
I'll go see Trent, Willoughby
and Castleton myself

334
00:23:59,014 --> 00:24:01,850
and tell them it's
my fault you resigned

335
00:24:01,934 --> 00:24:02,893
that you did it for me.

336
00:24:02,976 --> 00:24:05,771
It has nothing to do with you,
Ethne!

337
00:24:09,982 --> 00:24:11,943
Then why?

338
00:24:14,153 --> 00:24:18,491
I never wanted to join the army!

339
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:27,499
I did it for my father.

340
00:24:27,541 --> 00:24:30,461
I thought I'd serve out
my commission

341
00:24:30,544 --> 00:24:31,462
in a year or two

342
00:24:31,545 --> 00:24:34,131
keep everyone happy,
and then I could just...

343
00:24:34,214 --> 00:24:37,259
You'd what, wait till we were
married to tell me the truth?

344
00:24:37,301 --> 00:24:40,429
No, Ethne, I-I never meant
to lie to you.

345
00:24:40,471 --> 00:24:43,765
No, but you were quite happy
to let me deceive myself.

346
00:24:43,848 --> 00:24:47,811
Do you think people
will let us forget this?

347
00:24:47,852 --> 00:24:51,314
I don't care
what people think, Ethne.

348
00:24:51,356 --> 00:24:53,483
All I care about is us.

349
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:57,320
It's not about us, Harry.

350
00:24:57,446 --> 00:25:00,948
It's not just about us.

351
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:01,949
What about Jack?

352
00:25:01,991 --> 00:25:03,784
He would give his life for you.

353
00:25:03,868 --> 00:25:05,328
Don't you think I know that?

354
00:25:05,369 --> 00:25:06,704
Then go back.

355
00:25:06,787 --> 00:25:09,165
It's not too late.

356
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:11,751
Tell them
you wouldn't have resigned

357
00:25:11,834 --> 00:25:14,003
if it weren't for me.

358
00:25:14,087 --> 00:25:16,464
I would... have resigned...

359
00:25:20,175 --> 00:25:25,180
...and I wouldn't have gone
to war for anything or anyone.

360
00:25:29,101 --> 00:25:32,313
Then you are a coward.

361
00:25:53,749 --> 00:25:54,708
Fight for England!

362
00:26:08,263 --> 00:26:11,558
"Avoid drinking local water
and spirits

363
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,186
"avoid local barrooms
and brothels

364
00:26:14,227 --> 00:26:18,398
and, above all, remember,
you're a Christian soldier. "

365
00:26:18,482 --> 00:26:20,108
Why'd they give this to me?

366
00:26:20,192 --> 00:26:21,735
It must be for you, Vicar.

367
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:37,166
Father?

368
00:26:42,005 --> 00:26:43,297
After you.

369
00:26:45,591 --> 00:26:46,800
May I speak with you, sir?

370
00:26:49,261 --> 00:26:50,846
I don't know you.

371
00:26:57,186 --> 00:26:59,229
I need to speak with you, sir.

372
00:27:23,127 --> 00:27:25,713
British attack
the City of Korti!

373
00:27:25,796 --> 00:27:29,425
British casualties in the Sudan!

374
00:28:11,131 --> 00:28:13,300
Something wrong, Jack?

375
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:28,023
Well, I don't know about you lot

376
00:28:28,064 --> 00:28:31,026
but I'm going to get a drink
before Mustafa does.

377
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:35,364
It's probably poisoned.

378
00:28:40,244 --> 00:28:43,120
Mustafa, after you, mate.

379
00:28:48,918 --> 00:28:51,212
- Take cover!
- Stay down!

380
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:53,214
Take cover! Take cover!

381
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:54,299
Where is he?

382
00:28:54,382 --> 00:28:55,508
Get down and stay down!

383
00:28:55,592 --> 00:28:56,926
- Get down!
- Take cover!

384
00:28:57,010 --> 00:28:59,678
Where is he?

385
00:28:59,761 --> 00:29:00,888
Take cover!

386
00:29:00,971 --> 00:29:02,431
Stay down!
Stay down, everyone!

387
00:29:02,514 --> 00:29:06,685
Find him! Find him!
Where the bloody hell is he?

388
00:29:06,769 --> 00:29:07,728
He's on the roof!

389
00:29:07,811 --> 00:29:09,021
- Where?!
- Over there!

390
00:29:09,063 --> 00:29:10,397
Over there!

391
00:29:16,611 --> 00:29:17,695
Get him!

392
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:30,083
Now!

393
00:29:33,252 --> 00:29:35,504
- Move!
- Right, sir.

394
00:30:07,327 --> 00:30:07,785
Hey!

395
00:30:11,289 --> 00:30:12,749
Put the gun down.

396
00:30:14,459 --> 00:30:16,419
Put the gun down.

397
00:30:24,635 --> 00:30:26,262
Put the gun down!

398
00:30:38,566 --> 00:30:40,567
Tell him to put the gun down!

399
00:30:45,363 --> 00:30:46,656
Put your gun down!

400
00:30:46,698 --> 00:30:52,079
For God sakes, man,
put your gun down!

401
00:30:59,502 --> 00:31:00,211
Don't.

402
00:31:04,173 --> 00:31:04,841
Hold your fire.

403
00:31:08,344 --> 00:31:09,262
Put the gun down.

404
00:31:10,763 --> 00:31:12,640
Tell him to put his gun down!

405
00:31:12,724 --> 00:31:13,932
Don't! Don't! Don't!

406
00:32:01,395 --> 00:32:03,147
What's done is done, Harry.

407
00:32:03,231 --> 00:32:03,898
No, sir

408
00:32:03,981 --> 00:32:05,524
it isn't.

409
00:32:05,565 --> 00:32:07,651
Something like this happens...

410
00:32:10,529 --> 00:32:12,489
...and you're lost.

411
00:32:14,533 --> 00:32:16,410
You don't know

412
00:32:16,451 --> 00:32:19,496
who you are anymore
or what you're capable of.

413
00:32:21,165 --> 00:32:24,292
Unless I do something...

414
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:28,880
this is how people will
always remember me...

415
00:32:28,963 --> 00:32:30,590
a feather...

416
00:32:30,632 --> 00:32:35,595
and that is
how I will always see myself...

417
00:32:35,637 --> 00:32:37,597
a coward.

418
00:32:37,639 --> 00:32:42,351
All I know is I can't live
with myself like this.

419
00:32:44,979 --> 00:32:48,691
Who gave you the fourth feather?

420
00:32:50,443 --> 00:32:51,402
Jack Durrance?

421
00:32:53,863 --> 00:32:55,822
No, sir.

422
00:32:55,864 --> 00:32:57,824
Ethne did.

423
00:33:15,424 --> 00:33:16,884
Dearest Ethne:

424
00:33:16,968 --> 00:33:20,012
Forgive me for all the shame
I've caused you.

425
00:33:20,096 --> 00:33:22,432
I can only imagine
the indignities

426
00:33:22,473 --> 00:33:24,684
you must have suffered
because of me.

427
00:33:35,652 --> 00:33:38,322
I hope my leaving London will
at least allow you

428
00:33:38,363 --> 00:33:42,326
to begin your life again,
free of my shadow.

429
00:33:42,409 --> 00:33:45,537
I have no right to your trust
or claim to your love

430
00:33:45,621 --> 00:33:48,957
but please believe,
I never set out to deceive you.

431
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,959
I don't know

432
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,337
if an opportunity will ever
arise to redeem myself

433
00:33:54,421 --> 00:33:56,339
but I have to believe it will

434
00:33:56,423 --> 00:33:57,841
and I have to believe

435
00:33:57,924 --> 00:34:00,552
that this time
I'll face up to my fears

436
00:34:00,635 --> 00:34:04,889
and prove to myself and others,
I'm not a coward.

437
00:34:04,972 --> 00:34:07,224
What did he pay you
to bring him here?

438
00:34:07,308 --> 00:34:09,518
Listen, Gustave,
I wouldn't bring...

439
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,520
Take this.

440
00:34:11,562 --> 00:34:14,315
Now get out.

441
00:34:14,398 --> 00:34:16,025
Don't come back.

442
00:34:19,779 --> 00:34:21,279
What do you want?

443
00:34:21,363 --> 00:34:24,658
Can you take me
to the British camp at Korti?

444
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,994
Across the desert?

445
00:34:27,077 --> 00:34:29,162
Yes.

446
00:34:29,246 --> 00:34:30,289
Why?

447
00:34:36,545 --> 00:34:38,504
Can you take me there or not?

448
00:34:44,385 --> 00:34:46,346
For your time.

449
00:34:49,516 --> 00:34:51,184
Can you speak Arabic?

450
00:34:51,267 --> 00:34:52,894
I can learn.

451
00:34:52,936 --> 00:34:54,853
Yes, but can you learn
to look like an Arab?

452
00:34:54,937 --> 00:34:57,606
If the Mahdi's men find you...

453
00:34:57,690 --> 00:35:01,694
I'm taking a caravan of whores
up to Korti next week.

454
00:35:01,777 --> 00:35:03,696
Come and see me then.

455
00:35:03,779 --> 00:35:07,908
Left, right, left, right,
left, right, left.

456
00:35:07,992 --> 00:35:09,076
Thank you.

457
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:12,078
Left, right, left, right,
left, right, left.

458
00:35:12,162 --> 00:35:13,580
Congratulations, Jack.

459
00:35:13,663 --> 00:35:15,582
I've decided
to give you a few weeks' leave.

460
00:35:15,624 --> 00:35:19,211
Every report I receive
singles you out for praise.

461
00:35:21,797 --> 00:35:24,758
You and several other officers
will be going to London

462
00:35:24,841 --> 00:35:26,093
to convince Parliament

463
00:35:26,134 --> 00:35:28,260
and the public opinion
that it's high time

464
00:35:28,344 --> 00:35:30,304
this government ordered us
out of Korti

465
00:35:30,429 --> 00:35:32,598
to rescue General Gordon.

466
00:35:32,682 --> 00:35:35,101
With your permission, I'd rather
stay here with the regiment.

467
00:35:35,142 --> 00:35:36,144
Why?

468
00:35:36,185 --> 00:35:37,979
I don't feel
I've done my duty yet.

469
00:35:38,062 --> 00:35:40,106
I wouldn't want
to let the others down.

470
00:35:40,148 --> 00:35:42,900
Permission refused.

471
00:35:42,984 --> 00:35:45,277
Sir, why me?

472
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,613
Because you're a hero, Jack.

473
00:35:47,696 --> 00:35:49,656
With all due respect, sir

474
00:35:49,698 --> 00:35:52,534
I don't think
we've been fighting long enough

475
00:35:52,618 --> 00:35:54,870
to have any heroes
in this campaign.

476
00:36:12,846 --> 00:36:14,431
Shut up!

477
00:36:14,514 --> 00:36:17,976
Keep them quiet, Saadi!
What do I pay you for?!

478
00:36:31,197 --> 00:36:33,366
They are princesses.

479
00:36:33,449 --> 00:36:34,659
Can you imagine

480
00:36:34,742 --> 00:36:36,535
even the savages have royalty?

481
00:36:36,618 --> 00:36:37,828
But the British soldiers

482
00:36:37,911 --> 00:36:39,871
pay me three dirham
an hour for them.

483
00:36:39,955 --> 00:36:41,957
Well worth the trip to Korti.

484
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:45,627
Is this the Mahdi's territory?

485
00:36:45,711 --> 00:36:48,505
Everywhere is Mahdi territory.

486
00:37:16,865 --> 00:37:18,867
- Mm.
- Mm.

487
00:37:21,412 --> 00:37:23,205
What is it?

488
00:37:23,289 --> 00:37:24,540
She doesn't like my manners?

489
00:37:39,721 --> 00:37:41,056
Savage!

490
00:37:42,015 --> 00:37:42,766
Stop it!

491
00:37:42,849 --> 00:37:45,851
You're not to look at me!

492
00:37:45,893 --> 00:37:48,187
Stop!

493
00:37:48,271 --> 00:37:49,563
Stop doing this!

494
00:37:49,605 --> 00:37:52,149
Stop it! Stop it!

495
00:37:52,233 --> 00:37:53,651
Stop it!

496
00:37:53,734 --> 00:37:55,361
I'll teach you manners!

497
00:37:55,445 --> 00:37:57,739
Stop it! Enough!

498
00:37:58,865 --> 00:37:59,907
That'll teach you manners!

499
00:38:00,949 --> 00:38:02,784
Enough!

500
00:38:12,461 --> 00:38:16,090
You think she'll thank you
for what you did today?

501
00:38:16,131 --> 00:38:18,508
I don't expect her to.

502
00:38:18,591 --> 00:38:20,927
Of course you do;
you saved her life.

503
00:38:20,969 --> 00:38:23,471
Tsk, tsk! Tsk!

504
00:38:35,232 --> 00:38:36,817
They're like children.

505
00:38:36,901 --> 00:38:40,404
They have no concept
of gratitude or loyalty.

506
00:38:40,488 --> 00:38:44,617
That's something you British
don't understand.

507
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:48,871
You come here,
trying to civilize them

508
00:38:48,955 --> 00:38:52,040
with your Christian values.

509
00:39:07,306 --> 00:39:10,850
Now, she'll thank you.

510
00:39:17,857 --> 00:39:20,234
Don't be so proud, my friend.

511
00:41:24,353 --> 00:41:27,815
There are followers of the Mahdi
everywhere in the Sudan.

512
00:41:27,899 --> 00:41:31,444
The rebel tribes are gathering
forces under the leadership

513
00:41:31,527 --> 00:41:33,780
of the Mahdi to fight us.

514
00:41:33,863 --> 00:41:36,032
We do not need
more reinforcements.

515
00:41:36,115 --> 00:41:38,242
All we need is
for this government

516
00:41:38,284 --> 00:41:39,911
to give an order to march

517
00:41:39,994 --> 00:41:41,995
and we will route the enemy

518
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:44,957
and preserve the dignity
of our empire.

519
00:41:51,547 --> 00:41:53,424
Have you heard from Harry?

520
00:41:53,465 --> 00:41:54,633
No.

521
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,303
Have you?

522
00:41:58,428 --> 00:42:00,555
No.

523
00:42:00,638 --> 00:42:04,601
Ethne, you can't blame yourself.

524
00:42:04,642 --> 00:42:05,935
You make a stupid mistake

525
00:42:06,019 --> 00:42:08,313
and you pay for it
for the rest of your life.

526
00:42:08,396 --> 00:42:11,691
I can't forgive myself.

527
00:42:11,775 --> 00:42:13,235
You had your reasons.

528
00:42:13,318 --> 00:42:15,611
What reasons?

529
00:42:15,653 --> 00:42:16,904
Pride?

530
00:42:16,987 --> 00:42:21,659
Because I was afraid
of what people would say.

531
00:42:21,742 --> 00:42:25,663
What do I care what people said?

532
00:42:25,705 --> 00:42:26,998
I loved him.

533
00:42:27,081 --> 00:42:29,041
Ethne, you have to...

534
00:42:29,083 --> 00:42:30,960
He came to me, Jack.

535
00:42:33,003 --> 00:42:35,255
He came to me
and I turned him away.

536
00:42:35,338 --> 00:42:37,466
It's all right.

537
00:42:37,549 --> 00:42:42,262
It won't be like this
for the rest of your life.

538
00:42:43,889 --> 00:42:46,683
I'll write to you when I'm gone.

539
00:44:10,347 --> 00:44:13,725
Left, right, left, right,
left, right, left.

540
00:44:13,766 --> 00:44:17,979
Left, right, left,
right, left, right, left.

541
00:44:18,062 --> 00:44:22,442
Left, right, left, right,
left, right, left, right

542
00:44:22,525 --> 00:44:24,486
left, right, stop!

543
00:45:22,541 --> 00:45:24,043
Referee, come on!

544
00:45:24,126 --> 00:45:25,169
That wasn't fair!

545
00:45:33,093 --> 00:45:34,637
Congratulations!

546
00:45:59,118 --> 00:46:00,036
Open up.

547
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:01,704
He's got no teeth.
Get rid of him.

548
00:46:01,787 --> 00:46:03,706
Who's next?!

549
00:46:03,789 --> 00:46:05,291
Come on, keep 'em coming,
keep 'em coming.

550
00:46:05,374 --> 00:46:07,794
No, he's too small.

551
00:46:10,213 --> 00:46:12,506
I want to see
this man's teeth.

552
00:46:14,299 --> 00:46:15,384
He looks strong enough.

553
00:46:15,467 --> 00:46:17,886
Put him
with the baggage porters.

554
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:19,596
How many more we got?
How many, Bill?

555
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:22,683
Okay, we need
another three of them.

556
00:46:24,893 --> 00:46:26,812
What's going on?!

557
00:46:26,895 --> 00:46:28,856
This man comes
from a tribe of slaves.

558
00:46:28,939 --> 00:46:30,940
The men will not serve
with him, sir.

559
00:46:31,024 --> 00:46:33,443
Look, we need all the help
we can get.

560
00:46:33,526 --> 00:46:34,944
Baggage porter!

561
00:46:35,028 --> 00:46:37,781
Get him through.

562
00:46:37,864 --> 00:46:39,282
I can't believe it.

563
00:46:39,407 --> 00:46:41,409
Come on. Come on.
Get him through.

564
00:46:41,493 --> 00:46:42,953
Come on, next.

565
00:46:43,036 --> 00:46:45,497
My Dearest Jack:

566
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:48,624
I was so relieved
to receive your last letter.

567
00:46:48,707 --> 00:46:51,252
While the whole country
is celebrating

568
00:46:51,335 --> 00:46:53,087
your campaign against the Mahdi

569
00:46:53,129 --> 00:46:55,715
all I feel is dread
and all I think about are

570
00:46:55,798 --> 00:47:00,261
the precious times we spent
together: you, Harry, and I.

571
00:47:00,428 --> 00:47:02,179
My father used to say

572
00:47:02,263 --> 00:47:05,223
that God takes away
what's dearest to our hearts

573
00:47:05,307 --> 00:47:08,143
to remind us
how much we take for granted.

574
00:47:08,226 --> 00:47:11,938
Now that it's too late,
I wish I could turn back time.

575
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:15,442
How differently I'd do things
given a second chance.

576
00:47:15,525 --> 00:47:17,653
Take good care of yourself,
Jack.

577
00:47:17,736 --> 00:47:21,239
I don't mind if you don't
come back covered in glory.

578
00:47:21,364 --> 00:47:23,616
Just come back safely.

579
00:47:23,658 --> 00:47:26,494
Your friend forever, Ethne.

580
00:47:37,921 --> 00:47:39,840
Thoughtful of General Wolseley

581
00:47:39,882 --> 00:47:42,259
to give us these umbrellas,
eh, Vicar?

582
00:47:42,301 --> 00:47:44,303
I burn in the sun.

583
00:48:06,324 --> 00:48:07,617
Come on, now, faster!

584
00:48:07,659 --> 00:48:08,743
Faster!

585
00:48:19,003 --> 00:48:19,962
Watch out!

586
00:49:29,738 --> 00:49:32,074
Abou Fatma.

587
00:49:35,327 --> 00:49:38,663
My name is Abou Fatma.

588
00:49:38,746 --> 00:49:39,831
Vedu.

589
00:49:39,914 --> 00:49:44,168
I was a scout for General Hicks.

590
00:49:47,422 --> 00:49:50,717
There are many in this camp
who serve the Mahdi.

591
00:49:50,758 --> 00:49:54,511
When they find out there's
a British spy amongst them

592
00:49:54,595 --> 00:49:57,431
watching them, they'll kill him.

593
00:49:57,473 --> 00:50:00,768
It won't be long, Vedu.

594
00:50:11,736 --> 00:50:13,196
Why would you warn me?

595
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:19,703
For money.

596
00:50:19,786 --> 00:50:20,954
I can't pay you.

597
00:50:23,456 --> 00:50:25,250
What's the feather for?

598
00:50:31,547 --> 00:50:33,299
First time I killed a man.

599
00:50:38,012 --> 00:50:39,680
Five men.

600
00:50:39,764 --> 00:50:42,433
Wait.

601
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:49,064
Ten men.

602
00:50:49,147 --> 00:50:50,274
This...

603
00:50:50,357 --> 00:50:53,277
I will wear soon.

604
00:50:55,988 --> 00:51:00,283
I'm a good soldier.

605
00:51:00,324 --> 00:51:02,118
I... will protect you.

606
00:51:18,884 --> 00:51:22,263
Who did this?! Who did this?!

607
00:51:23,472 --> 00:51:25,516
Who did this?!

608
00:51:32,148 --> 00:51:35,525
Who did this?!

609
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:04,637
Keep your eyes to the front.

610
00:52:10,642 --> 00:52:13,979
Why would a British spy
be hiding from his own soldiers?

611
00:52:14,062 --> 00:52:15,856
I'm not a spy.

612
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:16,706
Is that the same letter
you read over and over again

613
00:53:16,789 --> 00:53:19,500
or do you get a different one
each day?

614
00:53:21,961 --> 00:53:23,796
He writes them to himself.

615
00:53:25,381 --> 00:53:26,841
Read us a line.

616
00:53:26,925 --> 00:53:28,510
Read your own.

617
00:53:28,593 --> 00:53:29,719
Don't be so coy.

618
00:53:29,803 --> 00:53:31,429
You're amongst friends.

619
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:34,765
Come on, Jack, you can trust us.

620
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:46,569
"I'm so glad I came to hear you
speak that day in London. "

621
00:53:49,613 --> 00:53:51,239
Come on, more than that.

622
00:53:51,323 --> 00:53:53,742
Don't leave us hanging on...
elaborate.

623
00:54:00,290 --> 00:54:05,295
"It made me realize how much
your friendship means to me.

624
00:54:05,337 --> 00:54:12,218
"Come back safely and soon...

625
00:54:12,301 --> 00:54:14,011
my dearest Jack. "

626
00:54:17,056 --> 00:54:19,142
Ooh!

627
00:54:19,225 --> 00:54:21,352
Well, well done,
"my dearest Jack"!

628
00:54:21,394 --> 00:54:22,812
Who's the lucky lady?

629
00:54:22,895 --> 00:54:24,771
Ethne.

630
00:54:28,275 --> 00:54:29,818
I'm going to ask her
to marry me.

631
00:54:46,668 --> 00:54:48,044
Congratulations, Jack.

632
00:54:48,086 --> 00:54:49,087
That's fantastic, Jack.

633
00:54:49,170 --> 00:54:50,755
She hasn't said yes.

634
00:54:50,839 --> 00:54:52,966
Aah, she will.

635
00:54:53,049 --> 00:54:55,260
"I realize how much
I bloody love you. "

636
00:54:55,385 --> 00:54:57,554
"How much your friendship
means to me. "

637
00:54:57,595 --> 00:54:58,888
Same thing.

638
00:54:58,929 --> 00:55:01,557
Cheers, Jack.

639
00:55:05,895 --> 00:55:07,229
Congratulations, Jack.

640
00:55:30,502 --> 00:55:32,628
They look like the Mahdi's men.

641
00:55:32,712 --> 00:55:35,006
I need to find out
where he's going.

642
00:55:37,091 --> 00:55:38,718
Deserters, sir.

643
00:55:50,479 --> 00:55:52,272
Corporal, cease fire!

644
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:00,072
Harry.

645
00:56:09,414 --> 00:56:12,500
Looks like they've stopped
for the night.

646
00:56:18,215 --> 00:56:20,967
Why is it so important
to follow them?

647
00:56:21,051 --> 00:56:23,678
The Mahdi spies will report
on our troop movements.

648
00:56:23,761 --> 00:56:24,929
Not the spies...

649
00:56:27,014 --> 00:56:28,641
...your friends.

650
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:36,816
To help them... if I can.

651
00:56:42,237 --> 00:56:44,740
Are you a deserter?

652
00:56:50,996 --> 00:56:52,831
Something like that.

653
00:56:58,127 --> 00:57:00,797
I was sent to fight,
and I ran away.

654
00:57:04,509 --> 00:57:05,885
Why?

655
00:57:07,679 --> 00:57:09,305
Why?

656
00:57:11,850 --> 00:57:14,435
Well...

657
00:57:14,518 --> 00:57:16,395
I just...

658
00:57:18,939 --> 00:57:21,400
There are many reasons why.

659
00:57:27,615 --> 00:57:29,575
Mostly, I was afraid.

660
00:57:47,175 --> 00:57:48,885
I found you half dead...

661
00:57:49,886 --> 00:57:51,637
...crossing the desert alone.

662
00:57:53,306 --> 00:57:56,309
You say you are afraid?

663
00:58:04,316 --> 00:58:05,901
It's a different kind of fear.

664
00:58:15,953 --> 00:58:18,247
Why are you protecting me?

665
00:58:21,207 --> 00:58:23,084
God put you in my way.

666
00:58:23,126 --> 00:58:25,378
I have no choice.

667
00:58:25,462 --> 00:58:27,255
God?

668
00:58:32,427 --> 00:58:34,387
Hmm.

669
00:58:34,429 --> 00:58:38,557
An Englishman and a Christian.

670
00:58:41,477 --> 00:58:44,230
You must've done something
terrible to offend him.

671
00:58:53,948 --> 00:58:55,449
You laugh like an Englishman.

672
00:59:00,287 --> 00:59:01,788
And how does
an Englishman laugh?

673
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:28,773
Abou...

674
00:59:28,856 --> 00:59:30,816
they're leaving!

675
00:59:33,152 --> 00:59:34,195
They're getting away.

676
00:59:35,696 --> 00:59:37,198
We can't lose them.

677
00:59:46,039 --> 00:59:48,208
All right, I'll...

678
00:59:48,291 --> 00:59:50,919
I'll just sit here
and wait for you.

679
00:59:52,629 --> 00:59:54,506
Take your time.

680
00:59:58,051 --> 00:59:59,386
Oh.

681
01:00:27,413 --> 01:00:29,832
That is the fortress
of Abou Clea.

682
01:00:29,873 --> 01:00:33,252
The British reinforcements
are stationed there.

683
01:00:33,377 --> 01:00:36,796
Why would the spies be going
to a British fort?

684
01:01:49,491 --> 01:01:54,580
The fort has been taken over
by the Mahdi's army.

685
01:01:54,663 --> 01:01:57,333
But this is where
our troops are heading.

686
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:28,585
Abou!

687
01:02:32,338 --> 01:02:33,548
Abou, warn my friends.

688
01:03:50,562 --> 01:03:52,564
Company, halt!

689
01:03:52,648 --> 01:03:57,444
- Company, halt!
- Company, halt!

690
01:04:35,232 --> 01:04:35,899
Mr. Trench!

691
01:04:36,942 --> 01:04:38,193
William!

692
01:04:38,235 --> 01:04:39,862
Get away from them!

693
01:04:39,903 --> 01:04:40,654
Leave them alone!

694
01:04:40,738 --> 01:04:41,739
You filthy...

695
01:04:41,822 --> 01:04:42,781
Sir?

696
01:04:42,823 --> 01:04:44,116
You leave
these bloody men alone!

697
01:04:46,451 --> 01:04:47,827
Come back here!

698
01:04:51,331 --> 01:04:53,583
Go on!

699
01:05:10,141 --> 01:05:12,768
Oh...

700
01:05:24,446 --> 01:05:25,530
Sir.

701
01:05:25,614 --> 01:05:28,825
The Egyptians have captured
an enemy scout.

702
01:05:34,414 --> 01:05:35,958
Where did you find this man?

703
01:05:36,041 --> 01:05:37,500
I came to you myself.

704
01:05:37,583 --> 01:05:40,920
The Mahdi's men have captured
your fort at Abou Clea.

705
01:05:40,962 --> 01:05:42,171
This man is lying, sir.

706
01:05:42,255 --> 01:05:44,132
He's the one who stole
the camels...

707
01:05:44,215 --> 01:05:45,300
They will attack you here!

708
01:05:50,597 --> 01:05:53,182
Tell him a British garrison
would never fall

709
01:05:53,265 --> 01:05:54,558
to the Mahdi savages!

710
01:05:56,602 --> 01:05:58,729
Ask him if he knows the penalty
for being a spy.

711
01:05:58,812 --> 01:06:00,522
I'm not a spy.

712
01:06:00,648 --> 01:06:03,484
The Mahdi's men have left
these bodies to keep you here.

713
01:06:03,525 --> 01:06:06,487
Tell him I'll bury him alive
if he speaks another word

714
01:06:06,529 --> 01:06:07,613
of English!

715
01:06:07,696 --> 01:06:10,281
Ask him who sent him here
and why.

716
01:06:20,208 --> 01:06:22,335
He says a British officer
sent him, sir.

717
01:06:22,419 --> 01:06:23,545
A general, no doubt.

718
01:06:23,628 --> 01:06:24,838
What was his name?

719
01:06:33,846 --> 01:06:34,764
Come here, son.

720
01:06:34,847 --> 01:06:36,682
I'll show you
a British officer.

721
01:06:36,724 --> 01:06:39,227
This is a British officer!

722
01:06:39,268 --> 01:06:42,146
And this...
is a British officer's blood.

723
01:06:42,188 --> 01:06:44,690
Now lick it up...
every bloody drop!

724
01:06:50,779 --> 01:06:52,489
Look! Don't be rash!

725
01:06:52,614 --> 01:06:53,365
Take him away.

726
01:06:53,407 --> 01:06:54,908
Find out why the enemy sent him.

727
01:06:54,950 --> 01:06:56,034
Use any means necessary.

728
01:06:56,118 --> 01:07:00,372
The Muslims always bury
their dead, even the enemy dead.

729
01:07:00,414 --> 01:07:03,416
These bodies have been
left here for a reason!

730
01:07:05,043 --> 01:07:06,544
Come on, you!

731
01:07:09,547 --> 01:07:12,050
Look, I think
you should tell Hamilton.

732
01:07:12,133 --> 01:07:13,051
I agree, Tom.

733
01:07:13,134 --> 01:07:14,886
What for?

734
01:07:19,556 --> 01:07:21,058
As a precaution, Tom.

735
01:07:22,601 --> 01:07:24,395
This man was trying
to mislead us.

736
01:07:26,939 --> 01:07:29,483
I've made my decision.

737
01:07:29,567 --> 01:07:31,652
I'm not going to waste
the colonel's time

738
01:07:31,736 --> 01:07:33,404
by sending
some half-naked savage

739
01:07:33,446 --> 01:07:35,196
in front of him
with a tall tale.

740
01:08:02,974 --> 01:08:04,934
What is it, Jack?

741
01:08:05,018 --> 01:08:07,652
There's something up.

742
01:08:07,687 --> 01:08:13,025
Thou God, who reigneth
over all the earth

743
01:08:13,067 --> 01:08:15,694
who art the Lord
of all our salvation

744
01:08:15,736 --> 01:08:17,863
give your ear unto my prayer.

745
01:08:17,946 --> 01:08:22,743
Allah!

746
01:08:22,785 --> 01:08:25,703
For Thou art greater
than the common man.

747
01:08:25,745 --> 01:08:27,956
Everything is as you wish it.

748
01:08:28,039 --> 01:08:29,582
Everything is as you will it.

749
01:08:29,666 --> 01:08:34,379
If what we're doing is just...

750
01:08:34,462 --> 01:08:36,923
then give us the strength
to serve you

751
01:08:37,007 --> 01:08:40,510
for that which I greatly feared
has come upon me...

752
01:08:42,928 --> 01:08:46,724
...and that which I was
afraid of is come unto me.

753
01:08:54,565 --> 01:08:55,441
Form a line.

754
01:08:55,608 --> 01:08:58,444
First company...
a section, if you please.

755
01:09:03,782 --> 01:09:06,618
One section will fix bayonets.

756
01:09:06,702 --> 01:09:07,911
Fix!

757
01:09:12,207 --> 01:09:14,251
Ready!

758
01:09:14,334 --> 01:09:15,919
Present!

759
01:09:19,505 --> 01:09:20,924
- Fire.
- Fire.

760
01:09:20,965 --> 01:09:22,091
Fire!

761
01:09:22,133 --> 01:09:23,468
Reload!

762
01:09:26,763 --> 01:09:27,764
100 yards!

763
01:09:27,847 --> 01:09:29,933
Present!

764
01:09:29,974 --> 01:09:31,309
They're not armed, sir.

765
01:09:31,393 --> 01:09:32,769
- Fire.
- Fire.

766
01:09:32,811 --> 01:09:33,395
Fire!

767
01:09:39,330 --> 01:09:40,790
What in God's name
are they doing?

768
01:09:44,919 --> 01:09:47,005
Present!

769
01:09:49,341 --> 01:09:50,258
- Fire.
- Fire.

770
01:09:50,342 --> 01:09:52,260
Fire!

771
01:09:56,764 --> 01:09:57,890
50 yards!

772
01:09:59,308 --> 01:10:00,684
Present!

773
01:10:05,690 --> 01:10:07,942
- Fire.
- Fire.

774
01:10:08,025 --> 01:10:09,235
Fire!

775
01:10:20,412 --> 01:10:22,289
Thank you, Mr. Willoughby.

776
01:10:22,331 --> 01:10:23,790
Thank you, Sergeant.

777
01:10:23,874 --> 01:10:26,251
Order... up!

778
01:10:27,710 --> 01:10:30,880
Soldier... arm!

779
01:10:30,963 --> 01:10:34,384
Left turn.

780
01:10:34,467 --> 01:10:37,303
Left, right, left!

781
01:11:10,752 --> 01:11:13,672
- Form square!
- Form square!

782
01:11:43,116 --> 01:11:45,285
Form square!

783
01:11:45,327 --> 01:11:48,330
Bring over those camels!
Line them up!

784
01:11:48,414 --> 01:11:50,624
Quickly now, take positions!

785
01:11:55,420 --> 01:11:57,380
Number Three Section, fall in!

786
01:12:04,888 --> 01:12:05,847
Steady.

787
01:12:05,889 --> 01:12:08,058
Steady, boys, steady!

788
01:12:08,141 --> 01:12:10,434
Be calm.

789
01:12:12,311 --> 01:12:14,522
Nice and calm.

790
01:12:22,446 --> 01:12:23,614
Be nice and calm.

791
01:12:26,408 --> 01:12:28,034
Battalion prepare the cavalry,
Mr. Willoughby.

792
01:12:28,076 --> 01:12:29,119
Battalion, prepare the cavalry.

793
01:12:29,244 --> 01:12:31,413
Make way for the cavalry!

794
01:12:34,207 --> 01:12:36,543
Number One Company,
prepare for volley.

795
01:12:36,585 --> 01:12:38,587
Number One Company,
two rounds volley fire!

796
01:12:38,629 --> 01:12:41,965
Number One Company...

797
01:12:42,049 --> 01:12:44,967
two rounds volley fire!

798
01:12:48,888 --> 01:12:50,890
Steady on the right,
Mr. Castleton!

799
01:12:55,603 --> 01:12:56,688
Pick your targets!

800
01:13:13,329 --> 01:13:14,163
Fire!

801
01:13:17,707 --> 01:13:18,416
Fire!

802
01:13:19,667 --> 01:13:20,835
Fire!

803
01:13:42,007 --> 01:13:45,594
Sir, we're being attacked
from behind, sir!

804
01:13:47,389 --> 01:13:49,599
Close in on the right,
Castleton!

805
01:13:52,310 --> 01:13:55,271
Officers to the front!

806
01:13:55,313 --> 01:13:57,273
Present...

807
01:13:57,357 --> 01:13:58,566
aim...

808
01:13:58,650 --> 01:14:00,443
Castleton!

809
01:14:00,527 --> 01:14:01,069
...fire!

810
01:14:04,823 --> 01:14:05,823
Fire!

811
01:14:19,824 --> 01:14:21,784
Keep your horses a target!

812
01:14:21,868 --> 01:14:23,411
Hold this line!

813
01:14:37,049 --> 01:14:39,677
The British Cavalry, sir!

814
01:14:42,263 --> 01:14:43,930
They're retreating!

815
01:14:45,974 --> 01:14:47,684
They're running!

816
01:14:48,685 --> 01:14:50,645
All right, men, cease fire!

817
01:14:50,729 --> 01:14:52,897
Cease fire!

818
01:14:54,524 --> 01:14:55,859
Cease fire!

819
01:14:55,901 --> 01:14:56,902
Congratulations, sir.

820
01:14:56,943 --> 01:14:58,028
Battle's not over yet.

821
01:14:58,069 --> 01:14:59,738
Yes!

822
01:14:59,821 --> 01:15:01,822
We sod 'em off, lads!

823
01:15:01,906 --> 01:15:03,991
Send out the skirmishers,
Mr. Willoughby.

824
01:15:04,075 --> 01:15:05,368
Send out the skirmishers!

825
01:15:05,409 --> 01:15:06,786
Well done, Four Section!

826
01:15:06,869 --> 01:15:08,245
Vicar!

827
01:15:08,371 --> 01:15:09,830
Come on, Vicar!

828
01:15:09,872 --> 01:15:11,082
Vicar, come on!

829
01:15:27,556 --> 01:15:30,058
- Close the square!
- Close the square!

830
01:15:36,981 --> 01:15:38,232
Charge!

831
01:16:21,558 --> 01:16:24,310
Deliver me from
blood guiltiness, O God.

832
01:17:05,020 --> 01:17:10,109
It's not the British!
It's the Mahdi!

833
01:17:15,948 --> 01:17:17,991
Get back!

834
01:17:41,264 --> 01:17:43,767
Volley fire, if you please,
Mr. Willoughby!

835
01:17:43,850 --> 01:17:45,769
The skirmishers, sir?

836
01:17:45,852 --> 01:17:47,686
Hold this square at all costs

837
01:17:47,770 --> 01:17:48,604
Mr. Willoughby!

838
01:17:50,814 --> 01:17:53,526
Get back to the square!
Get back to the square!

839
01:17:56,070 --> 01:17:59,198
Get back to the square! Go!

840
01:17:59,281 --> 01:18:03,618
Get back to the square! Go! Go!

841
01:18:03,702 --> 01:18:05,120
Vicar!

842
01:18:05,203 --> 01:18:07,330
...my sins deliver before me!

843
01:18:07,372 --> 01:18:09,374
Volley fire, Mr. Willoughby!

844
01:18:09,458 --> 01:18:10,834
Now!

845
01:18:15,756 --> 01:18:18,342
Mr. Willoughby,
I gave you a direct order!

846
01:18:19,468 --> 01:18:21,010
Castleton!

847
01:18:28,685 --> 01:18:30,812
Save me from my sins!

848
01:18:33,231 --> 01:18:36,484
Vicar,
get back to the four square!

849
01:18:56,044 --> 01:18:57,921
- Go on, Trench! Go on!
- Run!

850
01:18:59,798 --> 01:19:00,674
Present!

851
01:19:05,178 --> 01:19:06,555
Fire!

852
01:19:11,100 --> 01:19:12,685
Don't shoot!

853
01:19:14,937 --> 01:19:16,564
Come on! Let's go!

854
01:19:19,984 --> 01:19:21,527
Vicar!

855
01:19:36,471 --> 01:19:38,139
Close the square!

856
01:19:38,181 --> 01:19:39,850
Mr. Willoughby...

857
01:19:57,658 --> 01:20:00,828
Jack!

858
01:20:04,165 --> 01:20:07,543
What are your orders, sir?

859
01:20:07,584 --> 01:20:08,377
Sir!

860
01:20:10,087 --> 01:20:11,713
Sound the retreat!

861
01:22:19,587 --> 01:22:21,338
"My dear Jack... "

862
01:23:05,631 --> 01:23:06,882
Oh...

863
01:23:27,424 --> 01:23:29,093
I'm a fool.

864
01:23:38,811 --> 01:23:43,815
I was a fool to think
that I could ever go back home.

865
01:23:46,192 --> 01:23:47,485
I can't.

866
01:23:59,205 --> 01:24:01,874
Your friend needs help.

867
01:24:01,999 --> 01:24:05,127
My friend knows
how to help himself.

868
01:24:05,169 --> 01:24:07,630
I can't see.

869
01:24:15,762 --> 01:24:17,639
I can't see.

870
01:24:34,739 --> 01:24:38,493
I can't see!

871
01:24:44,416 --> 01:24:45,333
Oh! Don't!

872
01:24:46,209 --> 01:24:48,627
Don't! Don't! Don't!

873
01:24:50,254 --> 01:24:51,213
Who are you?

874
01:24:51,297 --> 01:24:53,716
I have letters.

875
01:25:12,734 --> 01:25:13,568
Oh...

876
01:25:23,202 --> 01:25:24,579
Who are you?

877
01:25:31,127 --> 01:25:35,089
I can't see. I can't see.

878
01:25:35,131 --> 01:25:36,049
Shh.

879
01:25:38,717 --> 01:25:39,843
I can't see.

880
01:25:39,927 --> 01:25:40,886
Shh.

881
01:25:44,556 --> 01:25:49,270
Shh. Shh...

882
01:26:31,143 --> 01:26:33,061
Hello, Jack.

883
01:26:33,145 --> 01:26:35,564
Ethne.

884
01:26:46,950 --> 01:26:48,785
How are you?

885
01:27:01,631 --> 01:27:04,466
I wanted to ask your advice,
General.

886
01:27:04,508 --> 01:27:07,136
My advice?

887
01:27:07,219 --> 01:27:09,555
Jack Durrance has...

888
01:27:09,638 --> 01:27:11,182
has asked me to marry him.

889
01:27:14,101 --> 01:27:15,519
You don't need my advice.

890
01:27:15,603 --> 01:27:18,856
Jack Durrance is a good man.

891
01:27:22,943 --> 01:27:25,237
I haven't answered him yet.

892
01:27:32,494 --> 01:27:35,122
I was wondering
if you'd heard from Harry.

893
01:27:37,123 --> 01:27:39,000
I've heard nothing

894
01:27:39,041 --> 01:27:42,545
and, uh...

895
01:27:42,628 --> 01:27:45,006
I don't think
I shall hear from him again.

896
01:27:49,594 --> 01:27:52,847
I should've listened.

897
01:27:55,516 --> 01:27:57,684
I miss him.

898
01:27:57,768 --> 01:28:02,815
My son loved Jack Durrance
like a brother.

899
01:28:02,898 --> 01:28:06,527
I know he'd want you
to be happy.

900
01:28:09,572 --> 01:28:13,366
A few more weeks and he'll
be able to ride without help.

901
01:28:13,450 --> 01:28:15,493
Will that be the end
of your penance?

902
01:28:28,756 --> 01:28:30,007
Jack.

903
01:28:30,091 --> 01:28:31,801
Oh-ho-ho-ho.

904
01:28:31,884 --> 01:28:33,260
Not bad.

905
01:28:33,344 --> 01:28:34,971
You should see me on a camel.

906
01:28:40,393 --> 01:28:42,061
Lavender...

907
01:28:42,103 --> 01:28:43,563
and onions.

908
01:28:43,646 --> 01:28:45,564
Sunday lunch.

909
01:28:45,605 --> 01:28:49,401
Take the horse to the stables
and you can have some.

910
01:29:06,125 --> 01:29:08,378
Thank you, Robert,
it's quite all right.

911
01:29:10,088 --> 01:29:11,422
It's me, Jack.

912
01:29:14,968 --> 01:29:16,261
Tom.

913
01:29:36,446 --> 01:29:39,741
They finally made you
captain, Miss Willoughby.

914
01:29:39,824 --> 01:29:40,951
All those decorations.

915
01:29:44,496 --> 01:29:46,206
You must have a few, yourself.

916
01:29:46,289 --> 01:29:49,126
How'd you know
I was visiting today?

917
01:29:49,167 --> 01:29:50,752
I, uh...

918
01:29:56,132 --> 01:29:58,009
I saw Harry, Jack.

919
01:30:04,098 --> 01:30:06,476
Where?

920
01:30:06,517 --> 01:30:09,145
In the Sudan.

921
01:30:12,523 --> 01:30:15,651
I was following our retreat.

922
01:30:15,734 --> 01:30:17,528
We had a terrible time of it.

923
01:30:17,611 --> 01:30:19,613
The enemy hounded us
all the way.

924
01:30:19,697 --> 01:30:22,324
The desert itself
seemed to side with them.

925
01:30:22,366 --> 01:30:24,785
We ran out of water,
medical supplies...

926
01:30:24,869 --> 01:30:27,078
even had
to leave stragglers behind.

927
01:30:27,162 --> 01:30:29,873
Finally, our own native scouts
turned on us.

928
01:30:29,956 --> 01:30:34,294
We lost more men on that retreat
than we did at the battle.

929
01:30:39,299 --> 01:30:41,259
Get out!

930
01:30:43,636 --> 01:30:45,012
Didn't you hear what I said?

931
01:30:45,054 --> 01:30:46,972
I said get out
or I'll have you whipped

932
01:30:47,056 --> 01:30:48,307
you filthy wog!

933
01:30:48,349 --> 01:30:50,184
Like you had my friend whipped?

934
01:30:57,733 --> 01:30:59,152
Harry?

935
01:31:01,111 --> 01:31:02,904
I sent a man to warn you

936
01:31:02,988 --> 01:31:06,700
and you had him tortured
for his pains.

937
01:31:09,328 --> 01:31:11,496
I...

938
01:31:13,499 --> 01:31:15,501
What would it have cost
to listen?

939
01:31:15,584 --> 01:31:16,835
I didn't know it was you.

940
01:31:16,877 --> 01:31:19,003
You should've taken precautions,
Tom.

941
01:31:19,045 --> 01:31:20,254
I didn't know it was you.

942
01:31:24,217 --> 01:31:26,052
For God's sake,
what are you doing here?

943
01:31:43,194 --> 01:31:45,029
And afterwards?

944
01:31:45,112 --> 01:31:50,076
He, uh... he asked me
for some money and left.

945
01:31:50,159 --> 01:31:51,743
To come back?

946
01:31:51,785 --> 01:31:53,578
No.

947
01:31:53,620 --> 01:31:56,790
No, there was a...
there was a rumor going around

948
01:31:56,873 --> 01:31:58,458
that some
of our surviving soldiers

949
01:31:58,542 --> 01:32:00,293
had been captured
and taken to prison.

950
01:32:00,377 --> 01:32:03,130
Harry thought Trench might be
one of them.

951
01:32:03,213 --> 01:32:04,715
He went after him?

952
01:32:04,798 --> 01:32:06,258
I tried to stop him, Jack.

953
01:32:06,341 --> 01:32:08,218
I told him they were only rumors

954
01:32:08,302 --> 01:32:12,054
that the chances of survival
were... virtually none.

955
01:32:12,096 --> 01:32:14,599
He wouldn't listen.

956
01:32:14,640 --> 01:32:19,562
Did you come here
to tell Ethne Harry was dead?

957
01:32:19,604 --> 01:32:21,564
I don't know that he's dead,
Jack.

958
01:32:21,606 --> 01:32:23,566
So you've come to give her hope?

959
01:32:25,109 --> 01:32:27,069
What would you do in my place?

960
01:32:27,152 --> 01:32:32,491
Keep it to myself, Tom,
until I was sure.

961
01:32:50,842 --> 01:32:52,510
What did he say?

962
01:32:52,594 --> 01:32:54,304
Your friend is dead.

963
01:32:54,387 --> 01:32:56,640
I saw Trench taken alive.

964
01:32:56,681 --> 01:32:59,767
Prisoners were taken
to Omdurman last month.

965
01:32:59,850 --> 01:33:01,519
Your army abandoned them.

966
01:33:01,602 --> 01:33:03,604
The shame is no longer yours.

967
01:33:03,687 --> 01:33:06,315
You're responsible
to yourself and to God

968
01:33:06,399 --> 01:33:08,109
not to them.

969
01:33:09,568 --> 01:33:11,487
I am responsible to my friend.

970
01:33:11,529 --> 01:33:13,197
I will find him.

971
01:33:13,281 --> 01:33:14,657
You have learned nothing.

972
01:33:14,699 --> 01:33:15,783
You've done enough.

973
01:33:15,867 --> 01:33:17,200
It's never enough, Abou.

974
01:33:17,242 --> 01:33:19,494
Look, if the Mahdi's men
find out I'm British

975
01:33:19,536 --> 01:33:21,121
they'll take me to their prison.

976
01:33:21,204 --> 01:33:23,123
It's the only way
I'll find my friend.

977
01:33:23,206 --> 01:33:24,541
They will hang you.

978
01:33:24,625 --> 01:33:26,835
Abou, you must help me get
into the prison.

979
01:33:26,919 --> 01:33:29,296
I will not be responsible
for your death.

980
01:33:31,632 --> 01:33:34,467
How could you be responsible
for my death?

981
01:33:38,346 --> 01:33:40,348
I will die if it is God's will.

982
01:33:41,766 --> 01:33:44,811
Yes?

983
01:33:46,980 --> 01:33:50,149
You English walk
too proudly on the earth.

984
01:33:57,406 --> 01:33:59,658
You are a fool...

985
01:34:02,286 --> 01:34:03,871
...my friend.

986
01:34:37,028 --> 01:34:38,780
Trench!

987
01:34:40,239 --> 01:34:41,239
Trench!

988
01:34:43,408 --> 01:34:44,451
Trench!

989
01:34:51,708 --> 01:34:52,751
Trench!

990
01:35:11,269 --> 01:35:12,437
Ibrahim!

991
01:35:12,520 --> 01:35:13,772
Trench!

992
01:35:13,813 --> 01:35:15,231
Don't lose our space!

993
01:35:17,483 --> 01:35:18,400
Come on, son.

994
01:35:18,484 --> 01:35:19,443
You mustn't fall.

995
01:35:20,903 --> 01:35:22,947
You mustn't fall.

996
01:35:26,909 --> 01:35:28,577
All right...

997
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:38,920
T- Trench.

998
01:35:39,004 --> 01:35:41,632
Harry?

999
01:35:51,432 --> 01:35:52,975
Harry...

1000
01:35:53,017 --> 01:35:56,437
if you didn't come with
the army, then who sent you?

1001
01:35:58,856 --> 01:36:00,191
You did.

1002
01:36:16,123 --> 01:36:20,503
All this way... for a feather.

1003
01:36:20,544 --> 01:36:22,630
I brought some money.

1004
01:36:26,966 --> 01:36:28,635
How much?

1005
01:36:28,677 --> 01:36:30,178
A hundred.

1006
01:36:33,890 --> 01:36:36,143
Hundred?

1007
01:36:45,401 --> 01:36:46,527
What's going on?

1008
01:36:46,611 --> 01:36:48,154
Who are those women?

1009
01:36:49,739 --> 01:36:52,283
They're all relatives
of the men in here.

1010
01:36:52,366 --> 01:36:54,327
They bring them scraps of food.

1011
01:36:54,410 --> 01:36:58,538
Let's see if we can get you
something to eat.

1012
01:37:00,582 --> 01:37:02,834
What can we do with this money?

1013
01:37:02,918 --> 01:37:06,213
Well, there's no chance
of bribing Idris.

1014
01:37:06,255 --> 01:37:10,259
His entire family was wiped out
by one of our artillery attacks.

1015
01:37:12,261 --> 01:37:15,054
Now, Hassan, on the other hand,
is infinitely corruptible.

1016
01:37:15,138 --> 01:37:19,601
For 100 dirhams,
he'll either help us escape...

1017
01:37:19,684 --> 01:37:23,480
or he'll stab us in the back
and keep the money.

1018
01:37:23,563 --> 01:37:25,899
I'll see if I can talk to him.

1019
01:37:25,940 --> 01:37:28,443
The first thing I do
when I get back

1020
01:37:28,526 --> 01:37:31,695
is book a table at Wilton's...
a private room.

1021
01:37:31,779 --> 01:37:33,239
No bloody crowds.

1022
01:37:33,322 --> 01:37:35,783
Two pints of stout,
please, guvner!

1023
01:37:35,866 --> 01:37:38,786
Ha! Not long now, Harry!

1024
01:37:38,911 --> 01:37:40,037
Not long now!

1025
01:38:01,850 --> 01:38:03,435
Trench.

1026
01:38:03,518 --> 01:38:05,436
Please, Trench, get up.
Trench, come on.

1027
01:41:46,691 --> 01:41:49,110
I have some money.

1028
01:41:49,152 --> 01:41:51,154
Money's no good for me.

1029
01:41:54,532 --> 01:41:58,119
I can't bribe
the guards anymore.

1030
01:41:58,203 --> 01:42:01,331
I have nothing left to lose...

1031
01:42:05,626 --> 01:42:07,586
...nothing left to live for...

1032
01:42:10,172 --> 01:42:12,424
...but still, I'm frightened.

1033
01:42:29,858 --> 01:42:32,569
Fear always remains.

1034
01:42:35,030 --> 01:42:36,989
Pray for me, Abou.

1035
01:42:38,866 --> 01:42:40,993
Take as long as you like.

1036
01:42:55,591 --> 01:42:58,886
I don't walk too proudly now.

1037
01:43:07,770 --> 01:43:09,230
Stop.

1038
01:43:21,074 --> 01:43:22,492
Have some food.

1039
01:43:25,787 --> 01:43:27,913
You're looking better.

1040
01:43:29,999 --> 01:43:31,751
You may not feel it,
but you look it.

1041
01:43:31,917 --> 01:43:35,880
When I get better,
will I look as bad as you?

1042
01:43:35,963 --> 01:43:37,715
We'll get you through this,
Trench.

1043
01:43:40,384 --> 01:43:42,678
I don't want to get
through this, Harry.

1044
01:43:45,305 --> 01:43:48,892
I don't think
I can take it anymore.

1045
01:43:53,855 --> 01:43:55,190
I had a visitor today.

1046
01:43:56,942 --> 01:43:59,069
He brought us a gift.

1047
01:44:12,123 --> 01:44:14,501
The poison will take
a few hours to work.

1048
01:44:17,003 --> 01:44:18,587
You won't feel any pain.

1049
01:44:18,670 --> 01:44:20,214
That'll make a change.

1050
01:44:26,303 --> 01:44:27,513
Careful.

1051
01:44:27,596 --> 01:44:29,723
I didn't mean
to be a pig about it.

1052
01:44:33,394 --> 01:44:36,688
How about we give them
one last night of hell?

1053
01:44:36,771 --> 01:44:38,732
I'll drink to that!

1054
01:47:22,390 --> 01:47:23,890
Oh, Trench.

1055
01:47:26,018 --> 01:47:28,437
I can't feel anything
in my legs.

1056
01:47:28,520 --> 01:47:30,731
The poison has paralyzed
your body.

1057
01:47:30,814 --> 01:47:32,149
It'll wear off soon.

1058
01:47:32,191 --> 01:47:34,610
I thought it was supposed
to kill me.

1059
01:47:34,651 --> 01:47:37,154
Only for a while.

1060
01:47:37,196 --> 01:47:40,157
You mean, you knew?

1061
01:47:40,199 --> 01:47:42,200
I couldn't be short-changed.

1062
01:47:42,283 --> 01:47:45,662
That's the last time
I let you buy the drink.

1063
01:48:07,975 --> 01:48:09,935
How many bullets?

1064
01:48:10,019 --> 01:48:10,478
One.

1065
01:48:13,564 --> 01:48:16,066
Better make it count.

1066
01:48:17,943 --> 01:48:18,652
No.

1067
01:48:18,735 --> 01:48:19,778
I can't carry him.

1068
01:48:21,696 --> 01:48:23,115
You can.

1069
01:48:24,574 --> 01:48:25,993
Save my friend.

1070
01:48:27,411 --> 01:48:28,745
Save my friend.

1071
01:52:58,672 --> 01:53:01,258
Look after your friend.

1072
01:53:01,341 --> 01:53:04,427
What will you do now?

1073
01:53:05,845 --> 01:53:08,389
Whatever God has chosen for me.

1074
01:54:01,190 --> 01:54:02,942
Do I look that bad?

1075
01:54:13,034 --> 01:54:16,288
Everyone said how...
much you'd changed.

1076
01:54:18,915 --> 01:54:22,002
I didn't believe them.

1077
01:54:34,138 --> 01:54:35,890
May I have it back?

1078
01:54:39,143 --> 01:54:41,062
That isn't why I came.

1079
01:54:41,104 --> 01:54:44,232
I'd still like it back.

1080
01:55:05,418 --> 01:55:08,213
I'm almost sorry to let it go.

1081
01:55:13,844 --> 01:55:19,265
It's brought me a lot of luck...
over these past few months.

1082
01:55:41,328 --> 01:55:43,622
Have you heard our news?

1083
01:55:43,664 --> 01:55:45,707
Yes.

1084
01:55:51,171 --> 01:55:52,714
How is Jack?

1085
01:55:55,633 --> 01:55:57,427
I think he's happy.

1086
01:55:57,510 --> 01:55:59,429
Good.

1087
01:56:04,017 --> 01:56:06,478
He deserves to be.

1088
01:56:09,688 --> 01:56:10,940
So do you.

1089
01:56:32,127 --> 01:56:33,587
It will pass.

1090
01:56:37,424 --> 01:56:40,010
You will meet someone soon.

1091
01:56:40,093 --> 01:56:43,347
Then you and her
and Jack and I...

1092
01:56:43,429 --> 01:56:45,056
Yes.

1093
01:56:45,139 --> 01:56:46,724
...will set up tea
and chat politely

1094
01:56:46,849 --> 01:56:50,269
as if... as if nothing ever
happened with us before.

1095
01:56:56,359 --> 01:56:58,945
That won't happen, Ethne.

1096
01:57:02,656 --> 01:57:04,783
It has to happen.

1097
01:57:06,994 --> 01:57:09,705
It has to because I love you...

1098
01:57:09,788 --> 01:57:11,749
Harry.

1099
01:57:15,169 --> 01:57:18,630
I love you and I can't...

1100
01:57:26,429 --> 01:57:27,889
I'm sorry.

1101
01:57:55,666 --> 01:57:59,086
Was that Ethne's carriage
outside?

1102
01:57:59,127 --> 01:58:01,755
She is giving me a ride
to the station.

1103
01:58:04,299 --> 01:58:05,759
Why didn't she come out?

1104
01:58:05,801 --> 01:58:10,179
I think she wanted to give us
a minute or two alone.

1105
01:58:10,263 --> 01:58:13,725
Do we need
a minute or two alone, Harry?

1106
01:58:18,938 --> 01:58:20,565
I came to thank you, Jack.

1107
01:58:20,648 --> 01:58:22,859
For what?

1108
01:58:22,942 --> 01:58:25,361
For standing by me.

1109
01:58:29,949 --> 01:58:31,534
If you're talking
about the feathers

1110
01:58:31,617 --> 01:58:32,618
I wasn't there.

1111
01:58:32,701 --> 01:58:34,078
Willoughby told me you were.

1112
01:58:39,834 --> 01:58:42,711
You don't owe me anything,
Harry.

1113
01:58:42,794 --> 01:58:44,880
The wedding isn't
for another month.

1114
01:58:44,963 --> 01:58:47,132
Ethne is free
to make up her own mind.

1115
01:58:47,215 --> 01:58:48,800
She's made up her mind.

1116
01:58:52,637 --> 01:58:54,389
You should trust her judgment.

1117
02:00:44,787 --> 02:00:47,706
To Castleton and all the others
we left behind.

1118
02:00:47,790 --> 02:00:49,208
Indeed.

1119
02:00:57,966 --> 02:01:00,552
You remember the first time we
led a cavalry charge in public?

1120
02:01:00,635 --> 02:01:02,095
Yes, I do, Jack.

1121
02:01:02,137 --> 02:01:03,847
You wiped the floor with me.

1122
02:01:03,930 --> 02:01:06,725
I believe most of my horses
ended up in the bandstand.

1123
02:01:06,808 --> 02:01:10,437
Yes, I did, and...
yes, they did.

1124
02:01:13,440 --> 02:01:17,401
Ethne was there... watching.

1125
02:01:17,485 --> 02:01:19,070
Yes, I remember.

1126
02:01:19,111 --> 02:01:20,738
You should.

1127
02:01:20,780 --> 02:01:22,532
You're the only one
she danced with.

1128
02:01:24,450 --> 02:01:28,746
I've never been so jealous.

1129
02:01:28,788 --> 02:01:31,623
I wanted to prove to her
that I was the better soldier.

1130
02:01:31,707 --> 02:01:33,750
Well, you always were
the better soldier, Jack.

1131
02:01:33,792 --> 02:01:35,210
Yes, of course, but...

1132
02:01:42,801 --> 02:01:46,931
She was the first person
I looked for in the crowd...

1133
02:01:46,972 --> 02:01:48,973
and she was staring at you.

1134
02:01:51,684 --> 02:01:52,769
Everyone else

1135
02:01:52,811 --> 02:01:55,438
was applauding me...

1136
02:01:55,480 --> 02:01:57,732
and she was staring at you.

1137
02:02:06,365 --> 02:02:07,867
Nothing's changed.

1138
02:02:13,831 --> 02:02:17,543
She's beautiful...

1139
02:02:17,627 --> 02:02:19,504
isn't she?

1140
02:02:23,465 --> 02:02:25,425
Yes, she is.

1141
02:02:48,615 --> 02:02:54,329
You may be lost...
but you are not forgotten.

1142
02:02:58,374 --> 02:03:01,752
For those who have journeyed far

1143
02:03:01,877 --> 02:03:06,757
to fight in foreign lands

1144
02:03:06,841 --> 02:03:11,178
know that the soldier's
greatest comfort

1145
02:03:11,262 --> 02:03:14,681
is to have his friends
close at hand.

1146
02:03:14,764 --> 02:03:17,392
Welcome home, Harry.

1147
02:03:19,269 --> 02:03:22,689
Thank you, sir.

1148
02:03:22,772 --> 02:03:25,984
In the heat of battle

1149
02:03:26,068 --> 02:03:28,320
it ceases to be an idea

1150
02:03:28,403 --> 02:03:32,323
for which we fight...

1151
02:03:32,406 --> 02:03:34,867
or a flag.

1152
02:03:34,951 --> 02:03:38,037
Rather...

1153
02:03:38,121 --> 02:03:43,251
we fight for the man
on our left

1154
02:03:43,334 --> 02:03:48,046
and we fight for the man
on our right...

1155
02:03:51,425 --> 02:03:54,553
...and when armies
have scattered

1156
02:03:54,636 --> 02:04:01,393
and when the empires
fall away...

1157
02:04:01,477 --> 02:04:11,111
all that remains is the memory
of those precious moments...

1158
02:04:15,657 --> 02:04:18,618
...we spent side by side.

1159
02:04:47,813 --> 02:04:49,898
Forgive me.

1160
02:04:49,982 --> 02:04:52,401
I did you a great wrong.

1161
02:04:52,484 --> 02:04:53,735
There is nothing to forgive.

1162
02:04:53,819 --> 02:04:55,236
Yes, there is.

1163
02:04:55,319 --> 02:04:58,072
I should've stood by you, Harry.

1164
02:04:58,156 --> 02:04:59,991
I should've understood.

1165
02:05:01,826 --> 02:05:05,079
I used to be so sure
about everything.

1166
02:05:05,163 --> 02:05:08,249
We both were, Ethne.

1167
02:05:08,333 --> 02:05:10,293
And now?

1168
02:05:20,761 --> 02:05:22,096
And now...

1169
02:05:24,098 --> 02:05:29,018
Well... well,
now I have no choice, Ethne.

1170
02:05:25,938 --> 02:05:29,053
God put you in my way.
