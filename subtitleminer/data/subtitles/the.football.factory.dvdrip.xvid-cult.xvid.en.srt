<i>These were the scenes</i>
<i>everyone feared.</i>

2
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,600
<i>Running battles</i>
<i>between English and Turkish fans...</i>

3
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,800
<i>...some here have been</i>
<i>seriously injured.</i>

4
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,600
<i>...it's very violent indeed.</i>

5
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,000
<i>Earlier, there was mayhem</i>
<i>on the main square...</i>

6
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:08,700
<i>Getting beaten up by football hooligans is like</i>
<i>having VD: the fuckin' pain goes on forever.</i>

7
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,500
<i>But that's</i>
<i>what makes it so exciting.</i>

8
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:14,500
<i>So this is me, Tommy Johnson</i>
<i>three weeks from now, nearly dead.</i>

9
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,000
<i>And do you know what the funniest thing is?</i>
<i>I could see it coming.</i>

10
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,700
<i>Anyway, it's almost over now</i>
<i>and all that matters is this: was it worth it?</i>

11
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,400
<i>There's nothing different about me.</i>

12
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:45,700
<i>I'm just ahother bored male approaching 30,</i>
<i>in a dead-end job who lives for the weekend.</i>

13
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,800
<i>Casual sex, watered-down lager,</i>
<i>heavily cut drugs.</i>

14
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,000
<i>And occasionally kicking</i>
<i>fuck out of someone.</i>

15
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,700
Zeberdee, it's Bill.

16
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,700
What? How am I?
What do you mean, "how am I"?

17
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,300
I'm fuckin' buzzin'!
We've gone right through the slit.

18
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,000
Keep your fuckin' nut down.

19
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,900
He's a right fuckin' stringer, this kid.

20
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,600
- What's he say?
- Nothing.

21
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,800
- What do you mean, "nothing"?
- He fuckin' hung up.

22
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,500
Raff, call Tommy.
Find out where he is.

23
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,100
There's a pub on the corner called
the Ship and Billet. Head for that.

24
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,800
I'll have to bell you back,
Harris is trying to get through.

25
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,800
Just spotted their little firm
going to a pub in Denbigh Street.

26
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,900
They won't know what's fuckin' hit 'em.

27
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,200
There you are.

28
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,800
Here, come here!

29
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,900
- Sweet, Bill?
- Yeah.

30
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,600
- Where's the others?
- On their way.

31
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:18,700
- Harris said there's about 25 of the others.
- There won't be when we've finished with 'em.

32
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,500
Wait round the corner!

33
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,000
What for?

34
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,300
Cos it's all going to be on top,
us all standin' here, you si.

35
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,000
- Jog on.
- Jog on!

36
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,500
Bill, it's Harris.

37
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,400
Hello, son. Yeah?

38
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,800
All right. See you there.

39
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,900
What happened to you last night?
Thought you was coming out for a drink?

40
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,200
Johnson had me on some nutty skunk.

41
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,100
Ended up down the petrol garage
at two o'clock in the morning.

42
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,000
What you driving for?
You're on a ban, you lunatic.

43
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,700
Ban? What am I gonna do, walk?

44
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,300
Here he is.

45
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,600
Right, there's someone
outside the pub.

46
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,600
- How old is he?
- He's only a kid.

47
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,300
Go on, crack him.
Keep the noise down.

48
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,300
<i>Keep the noise down.</i>

49
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:49,000
- Excuse me, mate, you got a light?
- Don't fuck about, ping him.

50
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,800
Let's go!

51
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,600
It's going good anyway.
Let's settle it.

52
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,300
- Come on, let's...
- Keep it down, keep it down.

53
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,800
- Keep it down.
- Fuckin' hell, come on, boys.

54
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,800
Keep it down, keep it down.

55
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,000
- Come on. Fuckin' hell.
- Keep it down.

56
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,500
Don't fuck this up.

57
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,600
Fuckin' clowns won't stop us.

58
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,500
You're fuckin' animals!

59
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,200
You give this fuckin' country
a bad fuckin' name!

60
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,300
You ain't no football supporters!
You're fuckin' muggy little cunts!

61
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,800
<i>What else are you gonna</i>
<i>do on a Saturday?</i>

62
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,600
<i>Sit in your fuckin' armchair wankin' off</i>
<i>to Pop Idols?</i>

63
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,300
<i>Then try and avoid your wife's gaze</i>

64
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,000
<i>as you struggle to come to terms</i>
<i>with your sexless marriage?</i>

65
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:27,400
<i>Then go and spunk your wages on kebabs</i>
<i>fruit machines and brasses?</i>

66
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,900
<i>Fuck that for a laugh!</i>

67
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,400
<i>I know what I'd rather do.</i>

68
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,300
<i>Tottenham away.</i>
<i>Love it!</i>

69
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,100
How fuckin' perfect was that?

70
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:53,900
Soppy bollocks here even managed to get
the canister inside the fuckin' pub this time.

71
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,600
Do you remember that time at Upton...

72
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,200
That time at Upton Park,
he let it off on the tube!

73
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:02,000
Mind you, premature ejaculation,
that's right up your fuckin' street!

74
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,400
Anyway, he's virtually throwing 'em
out of the fuckin' pub at me, right?

75
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,900
He's throwing 'em out of the fuckin'
pub at me. Crunch! Crunch!

76
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,900
I hit this geezer so fuckin' hard,
his legs went like a fuckin' baby giraffe.

77
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,700
State of that. I done me knuckles.

78
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,600
So hit people in the mouth,
not the back of the fuckin' head.

79
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:24,000
Just as well I did or you'd be
in hospital, you cunt.

80
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,400
<i>No-one loved Chelsea</i>
<i>more than me and Rod.</i>

81
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,100
<i>We grew up on football terraces together</i>
<i>with my old man. He knew the score.</i>

82
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,800
<i>The first bit of advice</i>
<i>he give me was:</i>

83
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,400
You know what to do
if someone tries to clump you?

84
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,900
Kick him in the fuckin' bollocks.

85
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,100
<i>Me and Rod did everything together.</i>

86
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,000
Hurry up, Tom, I'm starving.

87
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:46,300
<i>It took me an hour just to find it.</i>
<i>Still Rod didn't need to know that.</i>

88
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,000
She ain't walkin' for a week.

89
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,200
<i>My grandad old Bill Farrell,</i>
<i>drove us to drink</i>

90
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:53,800
<i>with his stories about the war</i>
<i>and how he fought to put the Great into Britain.</i>

91
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,900
<i>He said fighting at football was nothing</i>
<i>compared to the Germans.</i>

92
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,800
"We'll fight them on the beaches,
we'll fight them on the..."

93
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:03,400
<i>Although he went on, he was right.</i>
<i>We're an island race. It's what we do best.</i>

94
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:07,100
<i>It's not about colour or race,</i>
<i>it's just the buzz of being in the front line.</i>

95
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,000
<i>Truth is,</i>
<i>I just love to fight.</i>

96
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,700
<i>There's nothing wrong with me...</i>

97
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,700
<i>unlike Billy Bright, whose dad had a funny way</i>
<i>of setting a good example for his son.</i>

98
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,000
Right, that's it.
I'll fight every one of you

99
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,700
before you move on next door to us.
Come on, son!

100
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,700
<i>With parents like that,</i>
<i>he was never gonna end up in Greenpeace.</i>

101
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,100
<i>Still he was one of</i>
<i>the first football thugs</i>

102
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,400
<i>to see there was a fortune to be made</i>
<i>from England's love for ecstasy.</i>

103
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,400
Oi, three bottles of Bud, please, mate.

104
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:34,700
<i>Problem was he'd taken so many beatings on</i>
<i>the terraces that he weren't scared of anyone.</i>

105
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,200
<i>And the correct medical term for that is</i>
<i>a "total fuckin' psycho".</i>

106
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:42,400
Bill, let's get out of here.
There's about ten Stoke fans staring at us.

107
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,900
- How many of 'em did you say there was?
- About ten. Please don't start, Bill.

108
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,100
<i>- Right, which one of them's staring at me.</i>
<i>- The big geezer with the Hackett cap on.</i>

109
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,200
See you, you cunt. I'll cut you first.

110
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,000
<i>And that was his idea</i>
<i>of a good day out.</i>

111
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,200
You fuckin' mugs!

112
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:04,900
<i>But underneath the fun and games</i>
<i>and Range Rovers, Blliy was bitter,</i>

113
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,900
<i>cos he hever got to run our firm.</i>

114
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,700
<i>Harris was top boy and that was that.</i>

115
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,900
<i>He was smarter than Billy</i>
<i>and ran things like an army unit.</i>

116
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:16,100
<i>Deep down Billy knew he'd never be leader</i>
<i>and because of that he hated Zeberdee.</i>

117
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,300
<i>Why? Simple...</i>

118
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,600
<i>Zeberdee looked up</i>
<i>to Harris and not him.</i>

119
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,700
<i>And the more Zeberdee looked up to Harris,</i>
<i>the more Billy bullied him.</i>

120
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,000
<i>And what chance did Zeberdee have as a kid,</i>

121
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:30,000
<i>brought up in a concrete jungle</i>
<i>on glue and hate?</i>

122
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:33,000
<i>I don't envy the young 'uns any more.</i>
<i>It's a nightmare.</i>

123
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:37,300
<i>Warfare from the playground upwards and you</i>
<i>know what you have to do to survive in combat.</i>

124
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,800
Aargh!

125
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,000
<i>Just like me and Rod,</i>
<i>him and Raff are best mates,</i>

126
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,900
<i>only difference being</i>
<i>they're thieving little cunts.</i>

127
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,500
<i>In case you're wondering, we call him Zeberdee</i>
<i>cos he loves sniffin' powder.</i>

128
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,100
<i>And one dayn it'll be his downfall.</i>

129
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,900
Hold your hand out, Raff.

130
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,100
- What?
- Hold your hand out.

131
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,900
<i>You're just a fuckin' kid,</i>
<i>ain't you?</i>

132
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,100
Hold your hand out, Bill.

133
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,400
Do what?

134
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,000
Hold it out like Raff
and we'll see how old you are.

135
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,200
Oooh.

136
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,500
<i>No, let's have it right.</i>

137
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,200
You trying to mug me off?

138
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:29,400
Oh, shut up.
I'm only fuckin' about an' that.

139
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,900
<i>- What d'you mean, "fuckin' about"?</i>
<i>- What?</i>

140
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,300
What d'you mean, "what"?

141
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,300
You know, just...

142
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,300
Well, don't fuckin' just.

143
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,700
Leave it out.
You trying to wind me up?

144
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,900
<i>Ain't trying to wind anyone up.</i>

145
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,500
I'm fuckin' serious.

146
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,900
What I want to know is, what makes
you think you can come in here

147
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,500
<i>and mug me off in front of my pals?</i>

148
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,000
I... I didn't mean nothing by it, Bill.

149
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,900
It was only a bubble, that's all.

150
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,400
Just a bubble?

151
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:05,600
What you talking to me
in that fuckin' muggy rhyming slang for?

152
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,800
I never fuckin' liked you,
you little cunt.

153
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,100
<i>You're a wrong 'un,</i>
<i>just like your old man.</i>

154
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,900
<i>He was a degenerate fuckin' drunk.</i>

155
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,400
<i>Do you know what I'm thinking?</i>

156
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,100
<i>I'm thinking I should take you</i>
<i>outside and open you up.</i>

157
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,300
- Leave it out, Bill.
- Leave what fuckin' out?

158
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,500
What, d'you wanna get
involved an' all, do you?

159
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,900
Don't be stupid.
I'm just saying, he's only a kid.

160
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,700
<i>No, let's have it right, Tom.</i>

161
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,500
<i>If he's old enough to run round givin' it large,</i>
<i>fuckin' bashing people up with us,</i>

162
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,600
he's old enough to talk for himself.

163
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,600
I'll tell you something, Zeberfuckindee,

164
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,300
<i>I think I should take you outside</i>
<i>and teach you a lesson</i>

165
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:43,200
for mugging me off and making me look a cunt
in front of my fuckin' pals.

166
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,500
I...

167
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,400
I didn't say nothing.

168
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,000
Come on, outside,
you little fuckin' stumblebum.

169
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,300
Leave it out, eh?

170
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:57,800
Stop mutterin' and stutterin'
and fuckin' liven yourself up.

171
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:03,100
I fuckin' had you there!

172
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,900
Fuckin' hell, Zeb,
you should have seen your fuckin' face.

173
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,300
I thought you was gonna burst into tears.

174
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,400
What is it, four, five...
eight lagers, Donna, please, babe.

175
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,800
There'll be none of this in Australia.

176
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,700
As of next week,
strictly the amber nectar.

177
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:24,300
Not to worry, William.
I think I'm more of a cocktail man anyway.

178
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,100
Well, I won't be sitting next to you.

179
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,500
Well, that was the idea.

180
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,900
Bill, Albert,
I didn't see you there. Wanna pint?

181
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,800
<i>My grandad didn't like Bright.</i>

182
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,900
<i>Knew he was a bully.</i>

183
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,300
<i>Bill and Albert were just kids</i>
<i>when they did their National Service.</i>

184
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:41,300
<i>They were one of the first off the</i>
<i>landing crafts on June 6th.</i>

185
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:45,900
<i>Bill aways told me the only thing that kept him</i>
<i>going was Albert's determination and will to live.</i>

186
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,800
<i>They came home proud war heroes</i>

187
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,200
<i>and married</i>
<i>their childhood sweethearts.</i>

188
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,200
<i>And buried 'em together as well.</i>

189
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,300
<i>The council moved Albert to the flat above Bill</i>
<i>and they swapped door keys,</i>

190
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,500
<i>always vowing to keep an eye</i>
<i>on each other.</i>

191
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,900
Very funny. Very, very funny!

192
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,500
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

193
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,100
Now a little one. Now a little one.
That's it, now let me get the door.

194
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,700
Let me get the door.
I'll be right in there.

195
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:14,300
Comfy? Do you want any help with that?

196
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,400
<i>Bet you've seen some changes,</i>
<i>eh, you two? Yeah.</i>

197
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,200
Bit different nowadays,
though, innit, eh? Gone.

198
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:26,600
It's the Pakis coming over in the '70s, see.
Taking over everything. Spoilt it.

199
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,500
And what you got now, eh?
What you got now?

200
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,400
Fuckin' asylum seekers.

201
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:35,200
Bloody Tony fuckin' Blair.
He's gotta be a poof, ain't he? New Labour?

202
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,400
<i>I mean, and this game's gone.</i>

203
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:41,700
There was a time I used to be able to clear
seven and a half, eight hundred shots a week.

204
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,100
Not any more. Nah.

205
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,700
Now what you got is your fuckin' spades
up in Soho moonlighting!

206
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,900
Moonlighting!

207
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,900
Fuck's sake, that's a joke!
You need a full moon just to see 'em!

208
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,800
This country was built on
good people like yourselves.

209
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,000
Not enough of you about,
that's what I say.

210
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,900
Here, let me give you a hand with that.

211
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,300
Swing your old arse round in there, look.
That's it, lovely.

212
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:07,900
And I just want to say, it's been a privilege
to drive two gentlemen like you.

213
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,600
And the fare's on me.

214
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,300
Don't be silly.
You're letting the wheelchair fool you.

215
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,100
No, I insist.

216
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,800
<i>It's been an honour.</i>

217
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,800
Don't forget, you watch
out for them darkies, eh?

218
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,600
What a wanker.

219
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,200
Let's go dancing.

220
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,200
<i>Although he talked a lot of bollocks,</i>
<i>in some ways the cabbie was right.</i>

221
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,400
<i>Bill was what put the Great into Britain.</i>
<i>He was an old war hero.</i>

222
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,600
<i>But he'd moved on.</i>
<i>It was Australia for him and Albert now.</i>

223
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:48,200
<i>Somewhere they could live out</i>
<i>the rest of their days in the sun.</i>

224
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,000
Hello, Mavis, my little darling.

225
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,600
How are you?

226
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,600
I shall be sad to see you both gone, Bill.
Are you packed up yet?

227
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:08,300
Course we have.
Ain't you gonna say goodbye?

228
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,800
Can't you do better than that.?

229
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,600
What are you talking about, Bill?

230
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,100
Don't you know?

231
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,000
You fucking disgusting old man!

232
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,900
<i>That's what I loved about Bill.</i>

233
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,600
<i>He was still game.</i>

234
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:28,000
<i>He'd dreamed about. Living abroad for years</i>
<i>and how his time had come.</i>

235
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,100
<i>I even give him and Albert a little treat</i>
<i>for going away.</i>

236
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:35,200
My grandson gave me a going-away present.

237
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,100
A joint of his very best home-grown.

238
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,200
You mean drugs?

239
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,400
Yeah, well, you light up old, son.
I'll make do with this.

240
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,900
<i>It's amazing to think</i>
<i>in a couple of weeks</i>

241
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,100
we'll be watching the sun go down
on the other side of the world.

242
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,100
And it won't be surrounded
by tower blocks.

243
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:06,400
Miles of golden sand and bronze tits.

244
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,700
You packed yet?

245
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:14,100
Haven't given it a thought.

246
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,900
My case has been packed
and sitting inside the front door for three days.

247
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,800
You want to get your skates on, Farrell.

248
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:23,600
Oh, stop nagging, you old woman.

249
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,300
<i>- You know what Bert?</i>
<i>- What's that?</i>

250
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,800
I'm feeling dizzy.

251
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,200
<i>You always were, you dozy bastard!</i>

252
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,600
<i>The next best thing to violence is sex,</i>

253
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,500
<i>and seeing as there's</i>
<i>nearly 500,000 single women in London,</i>

254
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,200
<i>I must be in with half a chance.</i>

255
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:28,100
<i>Especially as I'd fuck</i>
<i>anything that's breathing.</i>

256
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I tell you, I'm fuckin' mullered, me.
I am fuckin' mullered.

257
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,600
Look at the fuckin' boat on it.
Imagine that round your fuckin' helmet.

258
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:43,200
No, no, no, Tom.
Proper fuckin' slosh pots.

259
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,300
Shut up, you...
What's the matter with you?

260
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:48,600
All right, sweetheart?
You all right, girl, yeah?

261
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,300
- All right?
- Do you want a drink?

262
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,900
<i>A few tequilas?</i>

263
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,800
A couple of little
cheeky tequilas, yeah?

264
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,900
<i>Shall we get on it?</i>

265
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,600
- A little cheeky tequila...?
- Tequilas.

266
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,900
<i>Get these two birds here</i>
<i>a couple of tequilas.</i>

267
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:04,900
I'm gonna smash the fuckin'
granny out of that.

268
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,400
<i>London's changed for the worse.</i>

269
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,400
All the good people, right,
all the good people...

270
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:30,500
are being forced into the suburbs,
due to the influx of illegal immigrants

271
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,000
forcing their way into this country.

272
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,700
<i>- I mean...</i>
<i>- Hey, mate.</i>

273
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,000
Mate, will you shut your fuckin' noise?

274
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,900
Here you are, sloppy bollocks.
You fuckin' cunt.

275
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,900
Get up there, girl. Get up there.

276
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,200
I cannot wait to fuckin' see your fanny.

277
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:19,800
I'm gonna fuckin' ruin you...
- Let's have a butcher's here. Rod, look.

278
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,600
- Smash you in the...
- Look at that.

279
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,700
Beautiful, beautiful.

280
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,100
He's only fallen asleep, Tameka.

281
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,100
Same here, Shian. Little fuckers.

282
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,700
Shame. He's hung like a pike in here.

283
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:40,300
Good for you.
I've got a stickleback in here.

284
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,700
You fuckin' little mug!

285
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:55,300
How dare you come into my fuckin' gaff,

286
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:58,300
and try and get hold of my little sister
against her will?

287
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,900
You're in bandit country now, boy,

288
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,100
no-one will even know
you were fuckin' here.

289
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,700
There's holes dug all over South London
for people like you.

290
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,100
<i>Jesus.</i>
<i>I was expecting cornflakes and a quick wank.</i>

291
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:17,800
<i>But instead, I get some nutter</i>
<i>in a Stone Island jumper and a blade in my face.</i>

292
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:21,100
<i>And worst of all,</i>
<i>that was where all the trouble started.</i>

293
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,000
Oi, silly bollocks. What are these?

294
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,100
What?

295
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,100
- What are they?
- Flowers.

296
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,700
- What sort of flowers, dinlow?
- Lilies.

297
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,800
Then what are they doing
with the chrysanths?

298
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,200
All right. Sorry.

299
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,500
- What?
- Er... there's someone here to see you, Bill.

300
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,400
Who?

301
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,700
<i>...the back door.</i>
<i>Left her watching Blind Date.</i>

302
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:49,600
<i>Marched on up to The Venus</i>
<i>and bumped into Sonny.</i>

303
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,000
<i>He's given me a couple of Es.</i>

304
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,700
<i>I've had them</i>
<i>with a bit more thingy,</i>

305
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:55,500
and wound up copping for two slosh pots
out of Chigwell.

306
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:59,600
Smashed the granny out of the pair of 'em
in the Tower Hotel till eleven, Sunday morning.

307
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:03,700
Yeah, I was back home in time for a Sunday
roast, but I was completely fuckin' anninilated.

308
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,100
Look, I've got to go, mate. My man's here.
Ta-da.

309
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,900
Good to see you, son.

310
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,600
<i>- How are you? All right?</i>
<i>- Not bad.</i>

311
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,900
Heard you Chelsea boys had a little turnout
at Tottenham at the weekend.

312
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,800
You ain't wrong. Heard you Millwall boys
had a little turnout down in Pompey.

313
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,500
We did. We should have had a meet.
Would have been fun.

314
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,500
You know where to find us.
Any time you like.

315
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,600
Your time'll come.
What have you got for me?

316
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,800
<i>One thing I never understood</i>
<i>about Bright was,</i>

317
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:29,700
<i>although he was in the Chelsea firm,</i>
<i>he did business with the head of their rivals.</i>

318
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,700
<i>Millwall.</i>

319
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,600
<i>Get that.</i>
<i>Two men that work together,</i>

320
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,500
<i>then kick fuck out of each other</i>
<i>if ever they get the chance.</i>

321
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,200
It's bang on. What you got round you?

322
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,100
Four K.

323
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,400
- Go on, then. I'll take the lot.
- Cash.

324
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,000
Hang on.

325
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,400
<i>Hang on.</i>

326
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,100
Slow down.

327
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,100
What? You're fuckin' joking!

328
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,900
All right.
I'll go straight up the hospital.

329
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,600
<i>Yeah ' see you there.</i>

330
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,700
<i>- Problem, Fred?</i>
<i>- It's my brother, Terry.</i>

331
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:06,100
Someone's just done him round the canister
with a cricket bat.

332
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,900
You're fuckin' joking?
Is he all right?

333
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,300
They don't know yet.

334
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,500
Look, I gotta go.

335
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,100
- I'll keep this lot on ice for you.
- I'll call you later.

336
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:26,700
Oi! What are you fuckin' doing?
You're three hours late.

337
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,500
Don't start, mate. I've had a bit of ag.

338
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,700
What you got a sheet on for?

339
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,000
You don't wanna know.

340
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,800
You're right, I don't.
Get in and sort them dinlows out.

341
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:38,000
They're putting lilies
in with the chrysanths.

342
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,600
You got anything on under there?

343
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,800
<i>What am I fuckin'paying for?</i>
<i>Just get on with it</i>

344
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,200
- What do you reckon, fat boy?
- You look like a vicar, mate.

345
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,800
Are you fuckin' mad?
This is Prada, you cunt.

346
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,700
It's iron's gear.

347
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,700
Get your fuckin' skates on.
We gotta get there for the draw.

348
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,200
Horrible cunt.

349
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:19,800
What about the draw?
How are we gonna find a telly to watch it?

350
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,900
Oh, there'll be tellies where we're going.

351
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,200
<i>Oi, Zeb, try and make sure we've got</i>
<i>a decent house to rob this time, will you?</i>

352
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,000
<i>I don't want to watch</i>
<i>some piece of shit.</i>

353
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:32,000
Slow down, will you, Davis, eh? What's
the matter with you? Are you a fuckin' Hoover?

354
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,800
<i>Whether we were thieving,</i>
<i>fucking or fighting tonight,</i>

355
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:38,000
<i>we'd a be glued to a TV set</i>
<i>to see who Chelsea drew in the Cup.</i>

356
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,600
<i>See, the beauty of the Cup draw is,</i>
<i>it's a lucky dip,</i>

357
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:43,900
<i>a chance to meet one of the old rivals,</i>
<i>like Cardiff or West Ham,</i>

358
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,800
<i>or if you're really lucky,</i>
<i>Millwall.</i>

359
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,600
<i>And cos the draw</i>
<i>meant so much to Billy,</i>

360
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:52,500
<i>he decided to take his long-suffering wife</i>
<i>Barbara out for a quiet, romantic meal.</i>

361
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,600
<i>However,</i>
<i>they got their wires crossed,</i>

362
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,700
<i>cos Barbara thought he was taking her</i>
<i>up the West End for some tapas.</i>

363
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,200
Let's see what's on the menu.

364
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,100
<i>Oi, it's my sister!</i>

365
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,200
<i>Oh, what, your girfriend?</i>

366
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,900
Oi.

367
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Either turn that TV up, or tell that lot down there
to hold their noise down.

368
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,400
Calm down, Bill.

369
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,500
We don't want to cause a scene.

370
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,900
No. No, you're right.

371
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,800
<i>- The old rubber glove!</i>
<i>- The old rubber glove, mate.</i>

372
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,500
Oi!

373
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,400
Oi. Will you shut up?
I'm trying to watch the fuckin' telly!

374
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,900
<i>...against 52.</i>

<i>Portsmouth.</i>

378
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
<i>Will pay number 38.</i>

379
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,900
<i>Middlesbrough.</i>

380
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,300
<i>Number 22.</i>

381
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,500
<i>Millwall.</i>

382
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,200
<i>Will pay 44.</i>

383

<i>Chelsea.</i>

384
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,900
Yes! Fuckin' yes!

385
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,200
<i>Another battle then.</i>

386
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,600
Eh? Can't fuckin' hear you.

387
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,600
Who is it, for fuck's sake?

388
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,400
Eh?

389
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,000
Yes!

390
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,400
- Who, who, who?
- It's fuckin' Millwall!

391
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:48,400
<i>Millwall-Chelsea.</i>
<i>Old enemies that always ends up in murders.</i>

392
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,600
<i>Literally in my case,</i>

393
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:52,500
<i>cos like a mug</i>
<i>I thought I'd get lucky in the same bar again.</i>

394
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,600
<i>And I see my new mate again</i>
<i>who, of course, turns out to be Millwall.</i>

395
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:59,400
<i>Maybe I should ask him if I fucked his sister,</i>
<i>seeing as I can't remember.</i>

396
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:06,400
<i>If I'd listened to my instincts and laid low, none</i>
<i>of this mess would have happened but I didn't,</i>

397
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,000
<i>and I only had myself to blame.</i>

398
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,900
<i>And occasionally, and I do mean occasionally,</i>
<i>it would be nice to have Bright out with us.</i>

399
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
<i>It's typicla that tonight</i>

<i>See? He does have a gentle side.</i>

401
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,200
Aaaarghh!

402
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:22,600
<i>Zeb and Raff missed the draw</i>

<i>robbing houses,</i>
<i>something they'd later come to regret.</i>

404
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,500
<i>Me, I'm beginning to get the feeling</i>
<i>old Magic Johnson's lost his touch.</i>

405
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:35,000
Drive, mate! Fuckin' drive.
I'm being chased!

406

<i>Lost his touch?</i>

<i>Bollocks.</i>

408
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,200
Hard to have a nice night
out in London, eh?

409
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,500
I blame all the blacks

<i>That's right, Danny. I'm sure</i>
<i>there's going to be a vast police presence</i>

416
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:15,000
<i>to keep the we-known hooligan elements apart</i>
<i>from these two teams.</i>

417

Well, come on, Albert, you old bastard!
We'll miss our flight.

420

All right, Bill? You look pissed off.

421

No, I'm not fuckin' all right.
Some cunt burgled my house last night.

<i>- Your mobile?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:38,600
I didn't know it was your house.
I didn't know it was your house!

438
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:41,800
Look, I've got all the gear.
I've got the PlayStation.

439
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,600
I'll shall fuckin' open you up!

440
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,200
Fuck.

441
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,200
Where are you from, mate?

442
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,200
Just around.

443
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,600
Are you fookin' Chelsea?

444
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,000
Yeah.

445
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,800
You flash cockney bastards.
Do you know Stanley?

446
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,200
Run!

447
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,700
Go on, run, you pair of rats.

448
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
<i>Drive on again mate. Drive on.</i>

449
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,900
Hey! Stop the fuckin' bus, you cunt!

450
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:43,000
Fuckin' come on!

451
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,100
Where the fuck are you running now?

452
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,500
Cunts! Fuckin' cunts!

453
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,000
Go on. Fuck off!

454
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:11,400
Come here.
You didn't fuckin' shine there, did you, son?

455
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,400
What?

456
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:16,100
I've got to go to work on him now,
stop him opening you up.

457
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,900
You silly bollocks.

458
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,600
What was all that about?

459
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,100
But we did 'em, didn't we, H?

460
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,500
<i>Billy had a real punishmeht lined up</i>
<i>for Zeberdee.</i>

461
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:28,400
<i>He weren't the forgiving type, but as long</i>
<i>as Harris was around, he couldn't touch him.</i>

462
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:31,700
<i>And Harris and Billy</i>
<i>certainy didn't need another reason to fall out.</i>

463
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,600
Right. No thieving.
No bringing attention to yourselves.

464
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,000
Just keep your nuts down.

465
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:59,000
I want you to be outside and back on the road
in five minutes.

466
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,400
Oh, yeah, and whatever you do, no fighting.

467
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,900
Bit rich, coming from him, innit?

468
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:11,200
Zeb, what did Billy say to you?

469
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,700
He said we've got to get his gear back to him
by tomorrow.

470
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,200
And we've got to apologise to his wife and kids.

471
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:19,600
You've had a result there.
You're lucky. He could have battered you.

472
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,200
Blinding result, eh?

473
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:25,800
This complete nutter will never talk to us again,
and everyone think s we're thieving little cunts.

474
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:30,000
<i>You are thieving little cunts.</i>
<i>But you know what you've got to do, don't you?</i>

475
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,500
Prove yourself at Millwall.
That'll sort it out.

476
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:36,100
Yeah, do the business down there,
and you'll be an hero in his eyes.

477
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:01,800
Will you stop moaning about beer?
All you do is complain about beer.

478
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:05,800
I'll be opening bottles with my fuckin' teeth
all the way up there, Bill.

479
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,700
Could have done with a couple of cans.

480
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,700
Shouldn't have had that chicken burger.

481
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,200
Stone me, it's them Stoke fans that done us.

482
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,500
- Where?
- Over there. Look. It's them.

483
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,400
<i>- It is them.</i>
<i>- It is an' all.</i>

484
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,600
On the Rory, on the Rory, on the Rory.

485
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,800
Listen. We'll get the beers safe.
Then we'll outflank 'em, yeah?

486
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,900
I ain't saying a word.

487
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,600
What the fuck are you doing?

488
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,600
There's two of them
Stoke fans that done us.

489
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:31,000
Drop 'em now. We'll be late for the meet.

490
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:33,200
Fuck 'em. They kicked the shit out of us.

491
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:36,100
<i>No. The gavvers are over there.</i>

492
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,400
<i>I'll give you fuckin' "no"!</i>

493
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,400
Northern cunt!

494
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,200
Fuckin' idiots.

495
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,900
Slow down, you two, for fuck's sake!

496
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,600
What, was you fuckin' bullied at school,
was you?

497
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,000
Have fun, boys.

498
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,900
Who are you fuckin' looking at?

499
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:22,000
<i>Billy's extensive vocabulary</i>
<i>would never get him into Parliament.</i>

500
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:25,900
<i>And this lot could be West Ham,</i>
<i>Cardiff, Arsenal, Stoken even Man United.</i>

501
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,600
<i>Don't matter to me.</i>
<i>The odds don't look very good.</i>

502
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,000
Know what? I think I'll call it a night. Tom?

503
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,700
Yeah, let's go and have a beer.

504
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,400
Yeah, good idea. We'll jog on.
What about you, Tom?

505
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:48,300
All right, boys. I'll see you in a bit.
Order us some Miller.

506
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,000
- Light?
- Er... regular.

507
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,800
- No problem.
- See you later.

508
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,800
You all right down there, mister?

509
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,400
<i>What happened to you?</i>

510
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,500
I've had the shit kicked out of me.
What about you?

511
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,000
Me? I'm dead.

512
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:55,400
Bill! Rod!

513
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,800
Help! Where are you?

514
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,400
Bill! Help!

515
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:04,500
Fuckin' hell.

516
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,800
Liven yourself up.
We're in court in half an hour.

517
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,100
Court? What?

518
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,100
Fuck... What about my dream?

519
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:15,600
<i>What the fuck was that dream a about?</i>
<i>Who was the pikey kid with the bandaged face?</i>

520
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:18,000
<i>Where was that tunnel?</i>
<i>What did i all mean?</i>

521
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:21,200
<i>Fuck it.</i>
<i>Must be that nutty skunk again.</i>

522
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:24,400
What's wrong with you, Bright?
You're 40 years old,

523
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:27,100
<i>and still you offend persistently.</i>

524
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,000
I see children with more common sense.

525
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,700
<i>What did you say?</i>

526
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:35,400
Don't you dare answer me with that
insolent tongue of yours, you fat fucking slob!

527
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:39,400
<i>The Establishment call us chidren while</i>
<i>they're at King's Cross having sex with 'em.</i>

528
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:42,200
<i>I should tell this old queer</i>
<i>to join us down at Millwall.</i>

529
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:45,000
<i>He might enjoy swapping that silly wig</i>
<i>for having a row.</i>

530
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:49,100
Yes, sir. I'm very sorry, sir. It won't happen
again, sir. You can be sure of that.

531
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,300
I do hope that's the case, Mr Bright.
I'm passing this over for reports.

532
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,000
<i>I'll see you</i>
<i>in a month for sentence.</i>

533
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,800
<i>- And Bright</i>
<i>- Yes, sir?</i>

534
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,400
If you appear before me
again before that date,

535
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:02,300
<i>I won't hesitate to give you</i>
<i>a custodial sentence of a least five years...</i>

536
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,300
<i>Why is it, while I'm having hightmares</i>
<i>about dead kids,</i>

537
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,400
<i>Rod's slipping into the court clerk?</i>
<i>What's he got I'm missing?</i>

538
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:11,200
<i>Shame. He's hung like a pike in here.</i>

539
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:14,000
<i>And it's tricky</i>
<i>cos he's been known to get serious.</i>

540
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:28,200
How are the tulips selling?
They flew out at the market.

541
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,700
What's happening, Tom?

542
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:34,700
Here. I got nicked with Bright the other day,
kicking off with the OB. You'd have loved it.

543
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,600
Nice one, Tom. Sounds really clever.
It's not my scene any more.

544
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:41,200
Yeah, well, I'm just saying.

545
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:45,300
Well, go and say it somewhere else, and don't
come down my stall giving it the big 'un.

546
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,500
All right. Slow down, Ad.

547
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,600
Slow down?
I'll tell you about fuckin' "slow down".

548
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:53,800
What's the matter with you, clumping people?
Ain't it about time you started growing up?

549
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:57,800
You're nearly 30. You wanna get hold
of yourself. It's all a lot of bollocks, anyway.

550
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:01,300
- What?
- You're a bright kid. Work it out.

551
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,800
- Here you are.
- No, they're from both of us.

552
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:18,500
Tommy... think about it.

553
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,000
<i>Nearly 30? What's he on about?</i>

554
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:27,000
<i>Jesus! I only wanted a bunch of fuckin' flowers,</i>
<i>and he tells me to think about my life.</i>

555
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:43,100
See you, Albert.

556
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:01,300
What's Harris and Bright doing there?

557
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:04,300
I could hardly stop them, Bill.

558
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,200
They're foolish men, Tom.

559
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:10,600
Harris think s we're connected
cos I fought in the war.

560
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:15,700
What he doesn't understand is, I fought to stop
people like him with their Fascist opinions.

561
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,600
Billy is a fuckin' idiot.

562
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:22,900
Are you still going to Australia?

563
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,900
I don't know. There's a spare ticket
going begging, if you're interested.

564
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,700
Your cousins would love to see you.

565
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,700
Do yourself a favour.

566
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:38,500
Put a bit of distance between you
and all that stuff you're mixed up in.

567
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,800
I'm all right, Bill.

568
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,400
I'm just having a laugh.

569
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,400
Well, just be careful.

570
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:49,300
Next time you visit the boneyard,
it could be in a box.

571
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:19,500
What are you fuckin' doing here,
you little cunt?

572
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,800
I've come to pay my respects.

573
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:24,200
Well, you're not wanted.

574
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:28,500
Let's have it right. You didn't even
fuckin' know him, did you? Did you?

575
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:33,200
Well, put your soppy cap on,
then, and fuck off.

576
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,300
Go on, jog on.

577
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,300
Don't forget our appointment.

578
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:02,100
All right, boys? What's happening?

579
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:04,500
Why have you got a dartboard
drawn on your shirt, Zeb?

580
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,900
Well, what's it got
to do with you, you mug?

581
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,800
All right, boys. First one to a hundred.

582
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,500
Aaaarghh!

583
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,700
Aaaarghh!

584
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,000
Stand up straight.

585
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,900
He wants to know
which one stole the PlayStation.

586
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:35,100
Me.

587
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,500
Good call. Crack on.

588
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:42,300
Aaaarghh!

589
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:44,300
Oi, shithead, hold your hand out.

590
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,500
- What, Zeb?
- I said, hold your hand out.

591
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:53,300
Just a kid, ain't you?

592
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,800
<i>You hold your hand out, Zeb.</i>
<i>Let's see how old you are.</i>

593
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,700
Are you trying to fuckin' mug me off?

594
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:10,100
<i>With Millwall round the corner,</i>
<i>it was time for the juniors to play</i>

595
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:13,100
<i>Nice to see Billy and Fred</i>
<i>could put their differences aside</i>

596
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,300
<i>when it come to their kids.</i>

597
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:19,700
Bit of a coincidence, eh? Our kids play against
each other just before we meet in the Cup.

598
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:23,100
Somehow, I don't think this game's
gonna get quite as messy. Do you?

599
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,100
Fancy yourselves in bandit country, then?

600
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,500
Well, let's have it right.
If history's anything to go by,

601
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:31,100
last time we met you lot,
we ran you all over London.

602
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,000
You couldn't run 100 yards, mate!

603
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:36,600
- Won't fuckin' need to, either!
- Don't get lemon, Bill. It don't suit you.

604
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:38,000
Spell it, you cunt.

605
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:39,800
C-U-N-T. Cunt.

606
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:41,900
I meant "lemon", soppy bollocks.

607
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,700
We'll see about lemon when you're lost
in deep south, you fat fuckin' prick.

608
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:50,000
Whoa! Now we're getting personal.
Now, what's your problem?

609
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:53,600
That you have to open your kebab shop soon
or that you buy Charlie off a white man?

610
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:59,000
Well, how does it feel doing business with
a Turk, when you're supposed to be right wing?

611
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:00,800
Scooby-Do's less confused than you.

612
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:03,100
You'll be confused
when I open your canister up.

613
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,300
You wanna wait
till the game or make one now?

614
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:08,500
Don't punch above your weight,
you long streak of piss.

615
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:11,300
Well, stop punching your old woman about,
then, wanker.

616
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:12,900
What did you fuckin' say, you mug?

617
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,500
You fuckin' heard,
you fat fuckin' Johnson cunt.

618
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:18,400
Fuckin' mug! Look at you, you cunt!

619
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:21,100
Get off me, you... Get off me, you cunt!

620
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,400
Fuck this.
If they can't be grown up, let's go.

621
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:29,100
I'll fuckin' do you!

622
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,900
<i>Just as I thought.</i>
<i>Rod's been plating the court clerk's Gary,</i>

623
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:46,300
<i>and now she wants</i>
<i>to meet his mates.</i>

624
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:50,900
<i>I told him I already met her in the dock,</i>
<i>but he insisted on a social one.</i>

625
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:55,400
<i>And why is it that when your best mate meets</i>
<i>a girl, he quickly changes into a fuckin' melt,</i>

626
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:58,600
<i>and acts like</i>
<i>he's only known you for ten minutes?</i>

627
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:02,400
So... what do you do, then, Thomas?

628
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:05,500
<i>Thomas?</i>
<i>Kick people's fuckin' heads in for a laugh.</i>

629
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,900
<i>And you shoud know, div.</i>
<i>You read the charges out.</i>

630
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,800
Me?

631
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:11,700
I work long and hard.

632
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Sounds like Rod!

633
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:22,000
<i>Yeah?</i>

634
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:27,700
Cor...

635
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:30,900
<i>Jesus, he's really picked one here.</i>
<i>The worst sort of all.</i>

636
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,300
<i>Wannabe middle-class scum.</i>
<i>I'd like to kick the cunt back to Penge.</i>

637
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,700
Seems nice.

638
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,000
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, he's a top bloke.

639
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:41,900
Bill, it's Tom. Fancy a quiet drink?
I'm bored out of my skull.

640
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,900
Meet me at work
around seven in the morning.

641
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,900
Don't worry. I'll bring my tools.

642
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,200
- Fancy a sauna?
- Good call, Bill.

643
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:06,600
Johnson!

644
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:08,600
Johnson!

645
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:13,000
All right, Billy. What's it gonna be today?
A little lavender head massage?

646
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,100
No, forget that and just crack straight on
with the blow job, eh?

647
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,300
Stone me, she won't be working for a week.
What was that screaming about?

648
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,800
- What do you think?
- Good boy.

649
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:25,400
<i>What do you think the screaming was about?</i>
<i>I'm having a fuckin' breakdown.</i>

650
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:30,200
<i>With my back against the wall there was</i>
<i>only one thing for it: seek counsle from Bright.</i>

651
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:32,100
Bill, can I talk to you for a minute?

652
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,300
Yeah, yeah, course you can, son.

653
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,500
It's just er... I keep...

654
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:43,000
I dunno. I just keep... You know?

655
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:45,800
Yeah, yeah, I know.

656
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,200
<i>- Really?</i>
<i>- Yeah, I know.</i>

657
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:53,500
Fuck! Fuck it.
I thought it was just me.

658
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:58,200
No, listen.
It happens to me all the time.

659
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:00,400
No, don't worry about it. It's sweet.

660
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:02,100
Don't worry. I'm gonna sort you out.

661
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:04,200
Thank s, Bill.
You're a fuckin' good man.

662
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:05,700
Listen. Don't mention it.

663
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:08,900
<i>- Here you are.</i>
<i>- What?</i>

664
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,500
<i>Go on son. Crack on. Go on.</i>

665
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,400
Enjoy!

666
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,400
<i>Should have seen that one coming.</i>

667
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:27,600
<i>The last person on earth you want to talk to</i>
<i>when you're paranoid</i>

668
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:30,400
<i>Ask Bright for advice, and</i>
<i>you get fuckin' Viagra.</i>

669
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,600
<i>And what a good mate he was</i>
<i>in my time of need.</i>

670
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:10,100
<i>Fuckin' fat little cunt</i>
<i>lazing about with his Penge minge.</i>

671
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:11,300
Wake up, sleepy.

672
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,500
That was my parents on the phone.

673
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:17,400
They're coming to London at the weekend
and want to take us out.

674
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:20,100
Well, as long as it ain't Saturday.
We got Millwall.

675
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,900
It is Saturday, Rod.

676
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:30,700
What about Sunday?

677
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:35,100
They're going to my brother's in Reading.
Don't tell me you'd rather go to football.

678
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,500
Well, I am male.

679
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:38,600
It's one game.

680
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:40,200
I am male.

681
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,600
But my parents only come round
once every few months.

682
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:45,400
Yeah, Millwall comes round
less than the eclipse, babe.

683
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,900
Well, don't just run out.

684
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:51,100
<i>- I'm going to work.</i>
<i>- Let's talk about it, eh?</i>

685
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,600
There's nothing to talk about.

686
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:56,000
<i>You either meet my parents on Saturday</i>
<i>or you never meet them.</i>

687
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:14,700
All right, boys?

688
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:18,100
Yeah. Sweet. Speak to you later.

689
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:24,100
Fuck off.

690
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,800
- Are you serving?
- Yeah, what do you need? Whites or browns?

691
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Hit him, hit him! Hit the cunt.

692
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:38,700
Come here.

693
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:41,500
Cunt! Cunt! Cunt!

694
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:44,900
Grab the fuckin' rock.
Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

695
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:50,600
Cunt!

696
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:52,200
Come on!

697
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:05,000
- Fuckin' hell!
- Shit, that must have been Zeberdee.

698
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:06,600
Come, let's go.

699
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:06,500
<i>My grandad's life</i>
<i>was disappearing in front of his eyes.</i>

700
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:11,200
<i>With Albert dead, he had no-one, apart from me,</i>
<i>so it was time to give him some family support,</i>

701
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:13,700
<i>and maybe even</i>
<i>some friendly advice.</i>

702
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:17,500
You should come to Millwall at the weekend.
That'll liven you up a bit.

703
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:26,200
You all right for money, Bill?

704
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:28,500
<i>Cos you know</i>
<i>you've only got to ask.</i>

705
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:30,900
<i>I'm earning a few quid</i>
<i>down the market now.</i>

706
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,700
It ain't as if I got
a bird to spend it on.

707
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:33,900
Unlike Rod.

708
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:37,200
You sound over the moon about that.

709
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:38,800
Yeah, well...

710
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,700
Your chance'll come.

711
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:49,300
Don't you ever get the itch?

712
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,100
Yeah.

713
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:55,700
I can see myself on a sun lounger
in my back garden,

714
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:58,100
a couple of kids running about...

715
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,100
sipping my Pimm's quietly.

716
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:02,400
Kids, eh?

717
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:03,800
Yeah. Why not?

718
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,100
What's their names?

719
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:09,300
Dorian, after my mate.

720
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:10,800
Dorian?

721
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:13,800
<i>Both of them?</i>

722
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:14,900
Yeah, probably.

723
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,500
What if they're girls?

724
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:20,500
Dorian.

725
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:24,100
You're a good boy, Tom.

726
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:27,700
Keep your eye on my wallet, Bill.

727
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:29,600
I'm going to the toilet.

728
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:48,700
I tell you what, Fred.

729
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,600
<i>This area beats</i>
<i>South London hands down.</i>

730
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:56,000
Bollocks, does it.
I'll have Bermondsey any day.

731
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,500
It's full of spivs and skint
hoorays round here.

732
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:03,600
I just wanna find this fuckin' Tommy Johnson
and get out of here.

733
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:06,300
Let's just cut him
and fuck off back over south.

734
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,000
<i>You're not wrong.</i>

735
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:12,700
Oi, you, skint boat, come here.

736
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:16,700
- Me?
- Yes, fuckin' you. Come here.

737
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,800
Come on.

738
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,600
Ever heard of a geezer
called Tommy Johnson?

739
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:28,400
Johnson...

740
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:31,000
Johnson...

741
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:34,700
No, I've never heard of him, mate.

742
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,100
Yeah?

743
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:37,500
Yeah.

744
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:40,000
<i>So, what's your name?</i>

745
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:43,600
- What?
- I said, what's your fuckin' name?

746
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:47,100
Dorian.

747
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:49,700
Poof!

748
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:53,400
Dorian? Sounds like a fuckin' poof.

749
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:55,300
Yeah, I know.

750
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:56,800
Just a name, though, innit?

751
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:58,200
Prove it.

752
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:01,100
Prove what?

753
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,500
Stop fuckin' stuttering,
and fuckin' prove it.

754
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,600
Just show him some fuckin' brief.

755
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:08,100
Er...

756
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:11,400
I ain't got my wallet on me, mate.

757
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:18,600
Go on, then. Fuck off, you mug. Go on.

758
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:21,400
Hang on.

759
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:27,000
<i>We'll see who the fuck you really are.</i>
<i>Give us your phone.</i>

760
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:35,000
<i>Who's this?</i>

761
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:37,300
<i>Hello. It's Rod. Is Dorian there?</i>

762
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:43,000
You've had a fuckin' touch. Little mug.

763
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:44,900
<i>Come on. Let's go.</i>

764
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:57,000
Do you reckon he's somewhere else?

765
00:55:57,100 --> 00:55:59,800
We'll try the other gaff.
He's got to be here somewhere.

766
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:17,300
<i>Fuckin' hell!</i>
<i>Did your arse drop, son?</i>

767
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:20,000
You'd fuckin' think so! I tell you.

768
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:24,100
The moment I seen them follow you in,
I knew you'd give them a dodgy name.

769
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:26,300
It's a little trick
we picked up in the army.

770
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:29,400
I'm definitely calling my kids Dorian now.
Dorian.

771
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:31,000
<i>- Dorian.</i>
<i>- Dorian.</i>

772
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:35,000
See you, Rodder, I fuckin' love you
sometimes. Do you know that?

773
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:37,400
You ain't too bad yourself, Johnson.

774
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:40,600
I'm well up for it now.
The omens are good. Millwall who?

775
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:43,000
<i>I'm gonna have a right</i>
<i>fuckin' buzz down there.</i>

776
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Yeah.

777
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:48,600
<i>Don't say it, Rod.</i>

778
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:51,300
What?

779
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:52,800
You fuckin' know.

780
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:56,300
Look, Tom, fuckin'...
Her mum and dad are coming down.

781
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:03,100
Tom, you'll need these
where you're going.

782
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,600
How you doing, mister?

783
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:38,200
Nah. Not good. You?

784
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:39,800
Still dead.

785
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:42,600
Sorry about that. Am I?

786
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:44,900
No, you're still alive.

787
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,900
<i>- Who are you, mate?</i>
<i>- Don't know mate.</i>

788
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,300
Can't tell till I
take these bandages off.

789
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:20,000
What?

790
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
What do you mean, "what"?

791
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,700
What are you looking at me like that for?

792
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:27,500
You don't know?

793
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:29,900
What, Rod?

794
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,200
You don't remember what
you done last night?

795
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:38,900
I was fuckin' lashed, wasn't I?

796
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:45,600
Last thing I remember was being in the boozer
with you and my grandad.

797
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:47,300
Jesus, Tom...

798
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,700
For fuck's sake, Rod, what's so bad?

799
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:52,200
You don't remember Barbara?

800
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:55,100
Barbara who?

801
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:57,400
You tried to get off
with Billy's wife.

802
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:00,200
Fuck off.

803
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:02,300
And when she blanked you, you beat her up.

804
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:06,600
- What?
- You broke her fuckin' jaw, Tom.

805
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:10,500
I know you're winding me up, Rod.

806
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:15,000
Please tell me you're winding me up, Rod.

807
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,700
I ain't, mate.

808
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:22,400
Fuck off, King. I tell you what.
I'll ring Zeb. He'll fuckin' know.

809
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:27,600
All right, Zeb?

810
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:30,800
Fuckin' hell, Tom.
I don't know what to say.

811
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:33,600
<i>You went berserk mate.</i>

812
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:37,800
<i>I've got to wash my hands of this one.</i>
<i>The cunt's been playing darts with me.</i>

813
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:44,500
What am I gonna do, Rod?

814
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:47,400
You're gonna have to go round there.

815
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:50,100
What?

816
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:52,300
Just go round there and fuckin' beg.

817
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:56,000
Well, that's a good idea. I might as well
break her fuckin' nose while I'm at it.

818
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:58,400
I don't know what else to say to you, Tom.

819
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:00,200
No, you're right. I'II...

820
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:04,600
I'll fling myself on my knees
and let him kick the fuck out of me.

821
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:07,200
Hopefully, he'll have mercy on me
if I'm on the floor.

822
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:10,700
You know him better than me, mate.

823
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:14,100
That's the problem. I know what he'll do.

824
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:54,200
Johnson.

825
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:59,500
Listen, Bill, listen.
On my life, I don't remember nothing.

826
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:02,400
I was obviously smashed out of my tree.
I've woke up...

827
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,600
I'm none the wiser, Bill. Please, Bill.

828
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:08,100
<i>I don't know what's gone on, mate</i>
<i>swear to you. Please Bill. Please.</i>

829
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:09,500
My life.

830
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:16,900
You soppy, muggy streak of piss.
I can't fuckin' believe you fell for that!

831
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:22,600
If you'd touched my woman,
you'd already be dead!

832
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:24,400
Fuckin' arseholes.

833
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:25,800
<i>Fuckin' funny, that, innit?</i>

834
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:30,200
Go on. Have a fuckin' laugh, will you?
Go on. Really fuckin'...

835
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:32,400
I really fuckin' need this at the moment,

836
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:36,600
what with my dreams,
fuckin' florists, fuckin' billboards...

837
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:37,600
Bollocks!

838
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:40,700
Cunts.

839
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:42,300
On his fuckin' knees!

840
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:53,200
<i>With mates like mine</i>
<i>you certainly don't need enemies. Jesus.</i>

841
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:55,300
<i>Three weeks ago,</i>
<i>I was getting on with my life.</i>

842
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:59,300
<i>But now, with Millwall round the corner,</i>
<i>I'm half the man I was, which ain't saying much.</i>

843
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:01,400
<i>And the worst is yet to come.</i>

844
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:04,000
<i>Here's Mark with the sport.</i>

845
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:06,200
<i>Well, the third round</i>
<i>takes place this Saturday,</i>

846
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:09,600
<i>and of course the pick of the ties</i>
<i>has got to be Chelsea against Millwall.</i>

847
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:13,000
<i>I know police leave</i>
<i>is cancelled, but this goes beyond that.</i>

848
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,600
<i>This is that ancient rivalry...</i>

849
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:15,900
Hello, Bill.

850
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,400
Donna, give him a pint, love.
Put 'em on the tab.

851
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:21,700
- How's your luck?
- Not bad, Billy. How are you?

852
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:25,800
<i>Right. Same as before.</i>

853
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:28,400
I'll take some of you lot
down through South Bermondsey,

854
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:31,000
and Tommy will take the
rest from Surrey Quays.

855
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:33,400
Where's the meet?

856
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:34,900
It can't be too far away.

857
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
They'll have spotters
out all over the place.

858
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:40,100
<i>- And it's on top of the Old Bill before we start.</i>
<i>- What about Billy?</i>

859
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:42,400
What about Billy?

860
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:44,300
He knows Millwall
like the back of his hand.

861
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:47,400
Fuck Billy.
He don't know what he's doing any more.

862
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:51,800
Now, let's have it right.
We all know he's become a liability.

863
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:54,400
<i>Granted, yeah he can have a row.</i>

864
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:56,600
But he can't run a turnout
down in South London.

865
01:02:56,700 --> 01:02:59,700
<i>He's a fuckin' lunatic.</i>
<i>Look what happened in Liverpool.</i>

866
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:01,100
Bollocksed the day up.

867
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:05,500
His problem is,
he's taken too much of that shit up his nose.

868
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:08,600
Just forget him.

869
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:10,300
Slow down. He's one of your own.

870
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:12,400
<i>Hang on.</i>
<i>You've got to make Harris right here.</i>

871
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:15,500
It's like having a big kid around.
He's a fuckin' dope, mate.

872
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:18,800
<i>Just let him take Zeberdee</i>
<i>and those chavvies. That'll do him.</i>

873
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:20,800
<i>You just wipe your mouth of him.</i>

874
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:22,600
He's a spent force.

875
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:51,000
<i>Bill...</i>

876
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:54,000
<i>Bill!</i>

877
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:03,600
What's the matter, babe?

878
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:07,100
You think I'm all right, don't you?

879
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:08,300
What?

880
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:10,800
I'm all right, aren't I?

881
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:12,900
Yeah, course you are, you silly sod.

882
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:15,900
Come here.

883
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:20,700
Eat your dinner.

884
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:38,500
Bright!

885
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:42,600
Don't fuckin' creep up
on me like that, you si!

886
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:44,100
Bill. Take it easy.

887
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:46,300
How comes you weren't down the pub
last night?

888
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:47,900
Fell asleep, didn't I?

889
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:52,200
<i>How comes you know I weren't there?</i>

890
01:04:52,300 --> 01:04:54,200
Harris belled me and asked where you were.

891
01:04:54,300 --> 01:04:56,900
<i>Well, he didn't fuckin' bell me.</i>
<i>Maybe he forgot, eh?</i>

892
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:03,400
<i>- Got it?</i>
<i>- Fuck me! What's that for?</i>

893
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:04,800
Millwall.

894
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:07,600
Don't be stupid.
You can't take a gun down there.

895
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:11,100
- It's only a flare gun.
- What are you on about? You'll kill someone.

896
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:13,200
<i>Meant to be having</i>
<i>a laugh aren't we?</i>

897
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:17,000
Fuckin' hell, Bill.

898
01:05:19,100 --> 01:05:20,500
You're on the turn, ain't you?

899
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:23,000
<i>- You ain't got nothing to prove.</i>
<i>- Ain't I?</i>

900
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:53,200
You look as handsome
as you did on our wedding day.

901
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:55,500
<i>Where are your medals?</i>

902
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:57,800
You can't go
to Whitehall without them, dear.

903
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:01,900
<i>You're a hero William.</i>
<i>Go and put them on dear.</i>

904
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:04,700
Make me the proudest woman alive.

905
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:34,200
Don't look at me.

906
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:49,000
Yeah, go on. Fuck off, you Pakis.

907
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,100
Fuck off!

908
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:56,200
Got the little chavvy?
Corned beefs all over the gaff.

909
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:57,600
I know, I know, I know.

910
01:06:57,700 --> 01:07:00,400
Did you see the state of his boat?
Did you see it?

911
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:07,800
You don't even know you're fuckin' born!

912
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:09,600
Oh, fuck off.

913
01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:29,700
Go on, fuck off, you old mug!

914
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:15,800
I know who I am now.

915
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:18,600
Show me, then.

916
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:42,600
All right, for fuck's sake.

917
01:08:45,300 --> 01:08:47,800
Hurry up, lazy bollocks.
It's Millwall today.

918
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:50,400
You all right?

919
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:53,300
I'm sweet, mate. I'm fuckin' buzzing.
This is it.

920
01:08:54,900 --> 01:08:57,100
What's wrong?
You look like you've seen a ghost.

921
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:01,200
Listen, Zeb. Listen, listen.

922
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:02,900
You... You'd better just...

923
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:06,400
What, Tom?
Fucking hell, Tom, what had I better do?

924
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:10,400
Just look after yourself.
It might turn ugly.

925
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:13,500
Don't worry about me.
I'm gonna be a fuckin' hero.

926
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:15,800
Liven up, we've got to meet the others.

927
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:20,000
I tell you, it's a fuckin' buzz! Come on!

928
01:10:01,300 --> 01:10:03,800
Here, Tom, where's Rod?

929
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:06,200
Fuck knows. You all right?

930
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:09,000
Yeah. Couldn't sleep, could I?
Fuckin' buzzing.

931
01:10:22,700 --> 01:10:26,700
<i>The wretch from Penge had got her claws in,</i>
<i>and only a miracle could bring him back.</i>

932
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:29,800
<i>But I couldn't see it happening.</i>
<i>I'd lost him when I needed him most.</i>

933
01:10:29,900 --> 01:10:33,800
<i>And not even someone of Rod's calibre</i>
<i>woud have the bottle to say...</i>

934
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:36,200
That espresso's really kicked in.

935
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:38,200
<i>Darling you don't drink espresso.</i>

936
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:51,100
Tell me more about the air conditioning,
Rodney. I'm fascinated.

937
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,200
Air conditioning?

938
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:57,100
You told me you run an
air-conditioning firm.

939
01:10:57,200 --> 01:11:00,600
Well, we have a few vans out on jobs at once
most of the time.

940
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:02,600
Well, it's always busier in the summer.

941
01:11:02,700 --> 01:11:05,000
Nothing like a soaring temperature
to help the work.

942
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:08,800
Anyway, most of the time I just sit
around the office, waiting for the weekend.

943
01:11:08,900 --> 01:11:11,800
Don't get me wrong.
I love the money the job pays.

944
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:16,300
But my real passion lies
in kicking people's fucking heads in at football.

945
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:20,000
See, I've got to channel it somewhere,
and as you can tell by my bulging stomach,

946
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:22,700
I don't participate in too
many sporting activities.

947
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:24,900
And I don't do drugs.

948
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Well, that's not entirely true,
but not a lot.

949
01:11:27,100 --> 01:11:30,800
So, I need my release, and a good fuckin' fight
seems the best way. Wouldn't you agree?

950
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:33,500
<i>Maybe not</i>

951
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:38,200
At least I wouldn't be walking around like you -
fuckin' horrible cunts with sticks up your arses,

952
01:11:38,300 --> 01:11:41,200
trying to pretend your little
suburban nightmare's all right.

953
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:43,800
<i>Then again,</i>
<i>it just depends which way you look at it.</i>

954
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:46,000
Mate, can we have the...

955
01:11:47,700 --> 01:11:49,200
No, I'll...

956
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:05,700
Rod! I fuckin' knew you'd make it!

957
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:08,700
Wouldn't miss it for the world, mate.

958
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:11,900
There's a fuckin' shot, man.

959
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:36,500
You lot fuckin' ready for us, or what?

960
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:38,700
Well, let's see how game you really are.

961
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:42,800
So, come and find us, then, shithead.

962
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:46,300
Oh, and be careful.
Remember you're gonna be in deep south.

963
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:49,100
Away from all the crowds
and the ready eye.

964
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:50,700
So, watch your fuckin' backs.

965
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:53,400
<i>- Fuckin' hell!</i>
<i>- Let's have it!</i>

966
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:13,800
Hello, Tom.

967
01:13:13,900 --> 01:13:15,100
What's happening, Joe boy?

968
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:16,700
Everything's sweet round here.

969
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:19,000
- Where's Harris?
- On his way from South Bermondsey.

970
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:21,000
Get yourself up on the bridge lively.

971
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:22,200
Later on. Bye.

972
01:13:26,700 --> 01:13:30,800
- Hello, Joe, son. Where are you?
- On the bridge. It's all quiet down here.

973
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:32,900
Keep your eyes peeled.
Well be there soon.

974
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,600
<i>Give you a bell if I see anything.</i>

975
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:37,500
<i>- Crack on.</i>
<i>- Speak to you later.</i>

976
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:10,700
- Right. Here you are. It's sweet.
- Other end of the bridge, lively.

977
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,300
Sweet, Bill?
Get down here all right?

978
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:33,500
30 years I've stood
toe to toe with you.

979
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:35,500
You fuckin' mug me off like that?

980
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:36,500
Forget it.

981
01:15:06,100 --> 01:15:09,500
Anyone who runs is gonna get
properly served up when we get home.

982
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:11,200
You got it?

983
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:15,400
Are you all right, son, yeah?

984
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:17,000
Yeah. Are you?

985
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:22,000
I've got to tell you now.
I've got a really bad fuckin' feeling about this.

986
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:05,800
<i>Come on! For fuck's sake.</i>

987
01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:23,600
Oi. Oi. Hold it here.
Hold it. Hold it.

988
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,900
Hold it.
Oi. Keep your fuckin' voices down.

989
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,700
Keep your fuckin' voices down.

990
01:16:33,700 --> 01:16:35,300
Keep it quiet. Keep it quiet.

991
01:16:50,100 --> 01:16:51,800
Fuckin' wankers!

992
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:54,600
Fuck.

993
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:04,900
Cunts!

994
01:17:04,900 --> 01:17:06,100
You and your f...

995
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:20,200
<i>Clear the area.</i>

996
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:22,100
<i>Immediately.</i>

997
01:17:24,300 --> 01:17:26,700
Fuckin' cunt!

998
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:33,700
<i>Disperse, immediately.</i>

999
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:44,900
<i>I repeat: disperse now.</i>

1000
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:49,800
<i>Clear the area.</i>

1001
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:52,900
Get him!

1002
01:17:58,900 --> 01:18:00,300
Step on the cunt!

1003
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:02,700
Get the cunt on the floor.
Get into him!

1004
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:11,900
Johnson! Johnson!
Leave my fuckin' brother in Casualty, you cunt?

1005
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:52,400
Get the fuck back!

1006
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:07,100
Get out of the way!

1007
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:19,200
Leave it.

1008
01:19:52,900 --> 01:19:55,200
You nearly wound up in
the boneyard, my son.

1009
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:00,900
How come you're here?

1010
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
They call it grieving.

1011
01:20:03,100 --> 01:20:05,500
I call it falling fuckin' over.

1012
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:12,900
Rod and the others was up.
Brought you some grapes.

1013
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:18,600
Was er... Zeberdee there?

1014
01:20:18,700 --> 01:20:21,200
Erm... young fella with black hair?

1015
01:20:22,300 --> 01:20:24,300
What, that little prick?
Yes, he was.

1016
01:20:26,500 --> 01:20:28,200
Thank fuck for that.

1017
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,400
What about Australia, Bill?

1018
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:37,400
I'll fly next Tuesday.

1019
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:41,400
What about you?

1020
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:44,800
What about me?

1021
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:47,500
Huh!

1022
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:49,200
Was it worth it?

1023
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:06,800
<i>Kicked half to death,</i>
<i>florists, cabbies, nightmares and visions.</i>

1024
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:08,700
<i>One of the old soldiers</i>
<i>gone for ever.</i>

<i>Bright gone for a seven,</i>

1026

<i>and bollocks so ruptured that the only thing</i>

<i>After all that you really do</i>

<i>Course it fuckin' was.</i>

1029

Yeah, just get a pint over here.

1030

They reckon, as soon as he got sentenced,
he started crying his eyes out.

I'll do it standing on my head, you mug.
Fuck off.
