21
00:01:15,055 --> 00:01:17,455
You really
make that up?

22
00:01:17,524 --> 00:01:21,460
Are you really
going to shave your legs?

23
00:01:21,561 --> 00:01:24,496
<i>Certo. All
the Italians do it.</i>

24
00:01:24,564 --> 00:01:28,000
Some country. The women
don't shave theirs.

25
00:01:28,068 --> 00:01:29,501
Eh, huh?

26
00:01:34,074 --> 00:01:35,507
Stop!

27
00:01:38,578 --> 00:01:44,016
It was somewhere right along here
that I lost all interest in life.

28
00:01:44,084 --> 00:01:46,518
Aha! It was
right here.

29
00:01:46,586 --> 00:01:50,022
This is where I saw
Dolores Reineke...

30
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:52,024
and fat Marvin!

31
00:01:54,594 --> 00:01:56,528
Why, Dolores?

32
00:01:56,596 --> 00:01:58,029
Why?

33
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:00,532
They're
married now.

34
00:02:01,601 --> 00:02:03,466
See what I
saved you from?

35
00:02:03,537 --> 00:02:07,473
If I hadn't told you, you never
would have followed them out here.

36
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:11,341
You made me lose
all interest in life,

37
00:02:11,378 --> 00:02:12,936
and I'm grateful.

38
00:02:18,151 --> 00:02:22,986
My brother said he saw
you and Nancy, Moocher.

39
00:02:23,056 --> 00:02:24,489
When?

40
00:02:24,558 --> 00:02:25,991
Uh... last Friday.

41
00:02:26,059 --> 00:02:27,492
Well, it wasn't me.

42
00:02:27,561 --> 00:02:29,995
I'm not seeing
her anymore.

43
00:02:38,071 --> 00:02:40,505
I kind of
miss school.

44
00:02:40,574 --> 00:02:42,508
This will be
the fýrst time

45
00:02:42,576 --> 00:02:45,511
no one will ask us
to write a theme

46
00:02:45,579 --> 00:02:47,513
- About how we spent our summer.
- Yeah.

47
00:02:50,484 --> 00:02:52,975
When you're 16,
they call it sweet 16.

48
00:02:53,086 --> 00:02:56,021
At 18, you can drink,
vote, and see dirty movies.

49
00:02:56,089 --> 00:02:59,718
What the hell do you get to do
when you're 19?

50
00:03:01,495 --> 00:03:03,292
You leave home.

51
00:03:03,363 --> 00:03:05,331
My dad said

52
00:03:05,432 --> 00:03:08,765
Jesus never went further
than 50 miles from his home.

53
00:03:08,835 --> 00:03:11,303
Look what
happened to him.

54
00:03:11,371 --> 00:03:12,804
Whoo!

55
00:03:17,544 --> 00:03:19,239
Hey, man,
this feels great!

56
00:03:19,312 --> 00:03:20,745
Ahh!
Come on in!

57
00:03:22,549 --> 00:03:24,449
Hey, come on in,
Dave.

58
00:03:24,551 --> 00:03:27,452
I read where
this Italian coach said

59
00:03:27,554 --> 00:03:30,455
it's no good to swim
right after a race.

60
00:03:30,557 --> 00:03:33,253
Who's swimming?
I'm taking a leak.

00:04:28,682 --> 00:04:31,651
He was as normal
as pumpkin pie,

79
00:04:31,718 --> 00:04:35,210
and now look at him.

80
00:04:35,322 --> 00:04:37,688
His poor parents.

81
00:04:39,693 --> 00:04:41,661
It's that cologne
he wears.

82
00:04:41,761 --> 00:04:43,991
It's called...

83
00:04:44,064 --> 00:04:46,032
Neapolitan
Sunset.

84
00:04:46,099 --> 00:04:49,034
Yeah? Well, the flies
seem to like it.

85
00:04:49,102 --> 00:04:50,535
There.

86
00:04:53,607 --> 00:04:55,541
This is it?

87
00:04:55,609 --> 00:04:58,544
Well, you know what
the doctor said.

88
00:04:58,612 --> 00:05:00,045
At your age...

89
00:05:00,113 --> 00:05:03,480
What the hell
do you mean "at my age"?

90
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,484
Damn see-through coffee.

91
00:05:05,552 --> 00:05:07,986
He says you have
a bad heart.

92
00:05:08,054 --> 00:05:10,488
That's got nothing
to do with my age.

93
00:05:10,557 --> 00:05:12,491
Our son's
ruining my health, Evelyn.

94
00:05:12,559 --> 00:05:14,493
What's he going to do?

95
00:05:14,561 --> 00:05:18,497
He wanted a year off,
so I give him a year.

96
00:05:18,565 --> 00:05:20,499
It hasn't
been a year yet.

97
00:05:20,567 --> 00:05:25,004
But, Evelyn, look what's happened
to him. He's turned into an "Ity. "

98
00:05:25,071 --> 00:05:28,507
"Ciao, Papa. Ciao, mama.
'Arrivederci. '"

99
00:05:28,575 --> 00:05:30,008
That's "Ity" talk.

100
00:05:30,076 --> 00:05:33,011
I used to think
it was funny at fýrst.

101
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:34,512
Not funny anymore.

102
00:05:34,581 --> 00:05:36,515
He was very sickly

103
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:39,518
until he started riding
around on that bike.

104
00:05:39,586 --> 00:05:44,148
Well, now his body's fýne,
but his mind is going.

105
00:05:44,257 --> 00:05:46,521
He used to be
a smart kid.

106
00:05:46,593 --> 00:05:49,824
I thought he'd
go to college.

107
00:05:49,896 --> 00:05:52,160
You didn't want him to.

108
00:05:52,232 --> 00:05:54,530
Why should he?
I never went.

109
00:05:54,601 --> 00:05:58,002
At 19, I worked
in the quarry ten hours a day.

110
00:05:58,071 --> 00:06:00,938
Most of the quarries
have closed.

111
00:06:01,007 --> 00:06:03,237
Let him fýnd
another job.

112
00:06:03,309 --> 00:06:05,777
Jobs are not
that easy to fýnd.

113
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:08,109
Let him look at least.

114
00:06:08,181 --> 00:06:10,411
Let him come home
tired from looking.

115
00:06:10,483 --> 00:06:11,916
He's never tired.

116
00:06:11,985 --> 00:06:13,418
He's never
miserable.

117
00:06:13,486 --> 00:06:14,544
He's young.

118
00:06:14,621 --> 00:06:18,421
When I was young,
I was tired and miserable.

119
00:06:18,491 --> 00:06:21,927
I had
my own place at 17.

120
00:06:21,995 --> 00:06:25,362
He says Italian families
stay together.

121
00:06:25,432 --> 00:06:27,900
Evelyn,
we are not Italian.

122
00:06:28,001 --> 00:06:29,935
I know, I know.

123
00:06:30,003 --> 00:06:34,440
It's just that I come
from a big family myself,

124
00:06:34,507 --> 00:06:37,442
and it was
kind of nice.

125
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:40,946
He thinks we should
have another child.

126
00:06:41,014 --> 00:06:41,946
What?

127
00:06:44,417 --> 00:06:45,907
<i>Buon giorno,
Papa.</i>

128
00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:48,453
I'm not Papa!
I'm your damn father!

129
00:06:48,521 --> 00:06:49,954
<i>Buon giorno,
Mama.</i>

130
00:06:50,023 --> 00:06:51,650
She's your damn mother.

131
00:06:51,758 --> 00:06:53,749
Did you win again?

132
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:56,420
The victory,
she was easy,

133
00:06:56,529 --> 00:06:58,463
but the promoter
tells me

134
00:06:58,531 --> 00:07:01,967
that the Italians
will be here soon.

135
00:07:02,035 --> 00:07:05,402
<i>I will race
with the best... Italianos.</i>

136
00:07:05,472 --> 00:07:07,406
Like nightingales
they sing.

137
00:07:07,474 --> 00:07:09,408
Like eagles
they fly.

138
00:07:09,476 --> 00:07:12,912
Speaking of flies,
you brought some in.

139
00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:15,413
<i>Fly in Italian
is mosca.</i>

140
00:07:15,482 --> 00:07:16,915
In English
it's "pest. "

141
00:07:16,983 --> 00:07:18,416
Speaking of pests...

142
00:07:18,485 --> 00:07:20,919
Isn't this
a lovely trophy?

143
00:07:20,987 --> 00:07:22,420
Oh, yeah.

144
00:07:22,489 --> 00:07:24,423
So what?

145
00:07:24,491 --> 00:07:28,427
I lived 50 years,
I never got a trophy.

146
00:07:28,495 --> 00:07:30,429
You never
got a trophy?

147
00:07:30,497 --> 00:07:31,930
Nope, never got one.

148
00:07:31,998 --> 00:07:33,431
I give you this,

149
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,933
numero uno,
King Papa.

150
00:07:35,001 --> 00:07:36,434
Don't do that.

151
00:07:36,503 --> 00:07:38,664
I have to take
a shower.

152
00:07:53,019 --> 00:07:55,453
There's that
"Ity" music again!

153
00:07:55,522 --> 00:07:58,457
I'm having this
out with him now!

154
00:08:03,363 --> 00:08:05,422

He's shaving.

159
00:08:22,982 --> 00:08:24,415
Well, so what?

160
00:08:24,484 --> 00:08:25,917
His legs.

166
00:08:47,307 --> 00:08:48,239
Yoo-hoo.

167
00:08:48,308 --> 00:08:49,240
Nancy!

168
00:08:49,309 --> 00:08:53,370
I was just
on my way to work.

169
00:08:53,479 --> 00:08:54,912
Come on in.

170
00:08:59,485 --> 00:09:00,918
You know what?

171
00:09:00,987 --> 00:09:02,352
No. What?

172
00:09:02,422 --> 00:09:03,855
I'm leaving home,
that's what.

173
00:09:03,923 --> 00:09:05,857
Where are you going?

174
00:09:05,925 --> 00:09:07,859
About
fýve blocks south.

175
00:09:07,927 --> 00:09:09,360
Oh.

176
00:09:09,429 --> 00:09:12,364
I found this nice
little place to rent.

177
00:09:12,432 --> 00:09:14,366
It's so cute
I could scream.

178
00:09:14,434 --> 00:09:18,871
My folks said I could have
some of their furniture.

179
00:09:18,938 --> 00:09:20,371
All right!

180
00:09:28,448 --> 00:09:32,384
Maybe you could
give me a hand... moving.

181
00:09:35,955 --> 00:09:37,388
Oh, sure.

182
00:09:37,457 --> 00:09:40,893
If I'm not too busy,
you know?

183
00:09:48,334 --> 00:09:49,858
How's the job?

184
00:09:49,969 --> 00:09:51,903
You know what?

185
00:09:51,971 --> 00:09:54,064
Frank said if I keep up
the good work,

186
00:09:54,173 --> 00:09:57,233
in time, I'll become
head cashier.

187
00:09:57,343 --> 00:09:58,537
That's great.

188
00:10:01,481 --> 00:10:04,416
Well,
I should go now.

189
00:10:04,484 --> 00:10:05,917
Nancy.

190
00:10:05,985 --> 00:10:07,418
Uh...

191
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:10,923
I think
I'll walk you to work.

192
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:13,925
I'm going out
that way anyways.

193
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:27,770
It gets 30 miles
to the gallon.

194
00:10:27,874 --> 00:10:32,277
Of course, the mileage
you get may vary.

195
00:10:32,345 --> 00:10:34,279
It's a beaut, right?

196
00:10:35,348 --> 00:10:36,610
Right.

197
00:10:37,884 --> 00:10:40,512
Boy, you sure know how
to pick 'em.

198
00:10:40,586 --> 00:10:43,612
Frankly, this is
the best car on the lot.

199
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:44,952
Quality product.

200
00:10:45,058 --> 00:10:46,423
<i>Buon giorno,
Papa!</i>

201
00:10:46,526 --> 00:10:47,424
<i>Come sta?</i>

202
00:10:54,367 --> 00:10:56,232
Friend of yours?

203
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:04,939
Aren't you glad
we got fýred from the A & P?

204
00:11:07,046 --> 00:11:10,413
I mean, right now,
we'd be working.

205
00:11:10,483 --> 00:11:12,917
We didn't
get fýred, Mike.

206
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:14,919
You got fýred.
We quit.

207
00:11:15,021 --> 00:11:17,251
All for one
and one for all.

208
00:11:17,357 --> 00:11:19,291
You know, there
ain't many places

209
00:11:19,359 --> 00:11:23,420
that will hire
all four of us.

210
00:11:23,496 --> 00:11:28,433
- You know what I'd like to be?
- Smart.

211
00:11:28,501 --> 00:11:30,935
A cartoon
of some kind.

212
00:11:31,037 --> 00:11:32,937
Wouldn't that
be great?

213
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:35,940
You know,
when they get hit on the head

214
00:11:36,042 --> 00:11:37,441
with a frying pan

215
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:39,944
and their head looks like
the frying pan

216
00:11:40,046 --> 00:11:41,946
with the handle
and everything?

217
00:11:42,048 --> 00:11:43,948
Then they
go booooing!

218
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:45,950
Their head comes
back to normal.

219
00:11:46,052 --> 00:11:47,952
Wouldn't that
be great?

220
00:11:50,056 --> 00:11:53,457
How did you get to be
so stupid, Cyril?

221
00:11:53,526 --> 00:11:57,963
I don't know.
Guess I have a dumb heredity.

222
00:11:58,064 --> 00:11:59,964
What's your
excuse, Michael?

223
00:12:10,343 --> 00:12:12,243
You hear from
your folks, Mooch?

224
00:12:12,345 --> 00:12:13,744
Yeah, my dad called.

225
00:12:13,813 --> 00:12:16,748
There's a lot
more jobs in Chicago.

226
00:12:16,816 --> 00:12:19,944
He hasn't gotten
anything yet, though.

227
00:12:21,888 --> 00:12:24,721
Wanted to know
if the house was sold.

228
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:28,557
He could use the money
something fýerce.

229
00:12:30,363 --> 00:12:32,388
You can come live with me
when it's sold.

230
00:12:32,465 --> 00:12:34,899
In Italy, everybody
lives together.

231
00:12:35,001 --> 00:12:37,902
Since you won
that Italian bike, man,

232
00:12:38,004 --> 00:12:39,904
you've been
acting weird.

233
00:12:40,006 --> 00:12:43,407
You're really getting
to think you're Italian.

234
00:12:43,476 --> 00:12:46,206
I wouldn't mind thinking
I was somebody myself.

235
00:12:51,017 --> 00:12:54,680
I think the door's stuck
on that icebox.

236
00:13:04,163 --> 00:13:05,790
I can't see him!

237
00:13:05,865 --> 00:13:07,298
Oh, yoo-hoo!

238
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,927
It's got
no back on it.

239
00:13:28,588 --> 00:13:31,022
What the hell
are they doing here?

240
00:13:43,436 --> 00:13:46,599
I've never seen anybody
dive off from up there.

241
00:13:46,706 --> 00:13:50,164
Hey, you bastards!

242
00:13:50,276 --> 00:13:51,243
Who's that?

243
00:13:51,344 --> 00:13:52,971
Hey, cutters!

244
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:55,445
They got indoor
and outdoor pools on campus,

245
00:13:55,515 --> 00:13:57,278
and they got
to come here.

246
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,977
It's my
goddamn quarry.

247
00:13:59,085 --> 00:14:01,178
This hole,

248
00:14:01,287 --> 00:14:04,017
this quarry hole
is mine!

249
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:05,387
Hey, screw you, Cyril.

250
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:07,551
Come on, let's
get out of here.

251
00:14:07,627 --> 00:14:09,561
If they
can come here,

252
00:14:09,629 --> 00:14:11,426
then we'll go
to their campus.

253
00:14:45,498 --> 00:14:46,931
Going to college

254
00:14:47,033 --> 00:14:49,934
must do something
to girls' tits, I swear.

255
00:14:50,036 --> 00:14:51,901
Just look at 'em.

256
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:55,068
Hi there!

257
00:14:55,141 --> 00:14:56,972
What's your major?

258
00:15:02,315 --> 00:15:06,376
Sure look like
they've got it made.

259
00:15:06,485 --> 00:15:08,510
That's because
they're rich.

260
00:15:08,588 --> 00:15:11,216
Italians are poor,
but they're happy.

261
00:15:11,324 --> 00:15:14,589
Yeah, maybe
in Italy.

262
00:15:14,694 --> 00:15:15,592
Whoa! Whoo!

263
00:15:15,695 --> 00:15:16,719
Hey, good one.

264
00:15:16,796 --> 00:15:17,728
Go!

265
00:15:17,797 --> 00:15:19,731
All right! Here.

266
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:22,927
I wonder what it's like
to kiss a coed.

267
00:15:27,873 --> 00:15:29,898
Ha ha ha ha ha!

268
00:15:29,976 --> 00:15:31,568
Come on!

269
00:15:31,644 --> 00:15:33,942
Hey, that bastard's
giving us the fýnger.

270
00:15:34,013 --> 00:15:36,413
Hey, we're on
their turf, Mike.

271
00:15:38,384 --> 00:15:39,976
Come on!

272
00:15:40,086 --> 00:15:41,246
Dumb-ass
cutters!

273
00:15:41,354 --> 00:15:47,384
Goddamn bastard-lickin'
retards!

274
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,927
Number 1, move!

275
00:15:50,663 --> 00:15:53,154
Hut! 18! Hut!

276
00:16:03,576 --> 00:16:07,569
I thought I was a great
quarterback in high school.

277
00:16:07,647 --> 00:16:09,080
Still think so, too.

278
00:16:09,148 --> 00:16:12,083
Can't even bring myself
to light a cigarette

279
00:16:12,151 --> 00:16:15,416
because I keep thinking
I got to stay in shape.

280
00:16:23,663 --> 00:16:25,563
Know what really gets me?

281
00:16:25,665 --> 00:16:28,566
I got to live in
this stinking town,

282
00:16:28,668 --> 00:16:31,068
and I got to read
in the newspapers

283
00:16:31,137 --> 00:16:32,570
about some hotshot kid,

284
00:16:32,672 --> 00:16:35,197
new star
of the college team.

285
00:16:36,676 --> 00:16:40,737
Every year it's going
to be a new one...

286
00:16:42,048 --> 00:16:45,449
and every year, it's
never going to be me.

287
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:48,384
I'm just going
to be Mike.

288
00:16:50,189 --> 00:16:51,850
20-year-old Mike.

289
00:16:53,626 --> 00:16:55,253
30-year-old Mike.

290
00:16:56,529 --> 00:16:58,827
Old mean old man Mike.

291
00:17:02,968 --> 00:17:06,404
These college kids will
never get old or out of shape

292
00:17:06,472 --> 00:17:09,737
'cause new ones
come along every year.

293
00:17:12,478 --> 00:17:15,970
They're going
to keep calling us cutters.

294
00:17:17,983 --> 00:17:20,417
To them, it's just
a dirty word.

295
00:17:20,486 --> 00:17:24,252
To me, it's just
something else

296
00:17:24,357 --> 00:17:26,917
I never got
a chance to be.

297
00:17:34,367 --> 00:17:36,267
<i>Quanto serra il pro-</i>

298
00:17:36,369 --> 00:17:40,499
<i>pro-pros-prossimo.</i>

299
00:17:51,417 --> 00:17:54,284

you, uh...

306
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,879
is yours, no?

307
00:19:30,149 --> 00:19:32,709
You mean you've
been chasing me with this?

308
00:19:32,785 --> 00:19:34,047
Is nothing.

309
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:35,677
<i>Niente, signorina.</i>

310
00:19:36,956 --> 00:19:39,550
Are you
an exchange student or something?

311
00:19:41,427 --> 00:19:42,860

312
00:19:42,962 --> 00:19:44,361

My name is

314
00:19:48,267 --> 00:19:50,701
My name is
Katherine Bennett.

315
00:19:50,803 --> 00:19:52,498
Ah, Catherina.

316
00:19:52,605 --> 00:19:54,698
Catherina.

317
00:19:56,442 --> 00:19:57,875
Well, thanks again...

318
00:19:57,977 --> 00:19:59,376
again.

319
00:19:59,445 --> 00:20:00,878
Bye.

320
00:20:02,982 --> 00:20:05,075
Ciao.

321
00:20:46,358 --> 00:20:48,189
Son of a bitch!

322
00:20:55,034 --> 00:20:58,333
All right,
keep it steady!

323
00:20:58,404 --> 00:21:00,065
Keep your elbows bent!

324
00:21:00,139 --> 00:21:02,073
That's... that's right!

325
00:21:02,141 --> 00:21:04,666
Pick it up,
Kath... 30!

326
00:21:11,216 --> 00:21:12,148
Hi.

327
00:21:12,217 --> 00:21:13,912
What are you
doing, Kathy?

328
00:21:13,986 --> 00:21:14,975
Goddamn it!

329
00:21:18,857 --> 00:21:21,155
I want an answer, Evelyn.

330
00:21:21,226 --> 00:21:23,660
What are we
going to do about him?

331
00:21:23,729 --> 00:21:25,663
I don't know, dear.

332
00:21:25,731 --> 00:21:28,598
We could strangle him
while he's asleep.

333
00:21:28,701 --> 00:21:30,168
That's not funny,
Evelyn.

334
00:21:30,235 --> 00:21:31,827
Talk to him.

335
00:21:31,904 --> 00:21:35,931
I'm afraid to talk to him.
I'm afraid to look at him.

336
00:21:36,008 --> 00:21:40,172
I'm afraid his eyes
would twirl like pinwheels.

337
00:21:40,245 --> 00:21:41,678
I'm only
giving you these

338
00:21:41,747 --> 00:21:43,977
because you promised
to calm down.

339
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:45,914
Don't expect
any more.

<i>§Amor Alma §</i>

341
00:21:51,991 --> 00:21:54,391

Evelyn, he's not

345
00:22:13,912 --> 00:22:15,106
Stop!

346
00:22:15,214 --> 00:22:19,810
What the hell are you doing?
Them's my French fries!

347

00:22:30,396 --> 00:22:32,830
It's these damn

Hey, they're
my damn French fries.

354
00:22:35,401 --> 00:22:40,236
I have such
a pain in my heart, Mama, Papa.

I'm in love.

Suzy says this guy
sent you flowers.

357
00:22:53,585 --> 00:22:57,021
So what?
You never sent me flowers.

358
00:22:57,089 --> 00:22:59,023
Who is he, Kath?

359
00:22:59,091 --> 00:23:01,525
Some crazy guy I met.

00:23:01,593 --> 00:23:04,824

gotten into you?

Mama,

Damn!

372
00:28:10,469 --> 00:28:11,401
Ahh.

373
00:28:19,311 --> 00:28:22,246
Ah, there you are,
Fellini.

374
00:28:22,314 --> 00:28:23,747
<i>Come sta, eh?</i>

375
00:28:25,484 --> 00:28:27,952
Are you hungry?

376
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:31,456
This is spicy
meatballs here.

377
00:28:36,828 --> 00:28:38,921
Mmm!

378
00:28:42,167 --> 00:28:44,260
<i>Mangiare, eh?</i>

379
00:28:50,509 --> 00:28:52,909
Hey, hey!

380
00:28:52,978 --> 00:28:55,173
Guess what.
The Italians are coming.

381
00:28:55,247 --> 00:28:56,771
Guess what.
Mooch is going.

382
00:28:56,848 --> 00:28:58,679
You've got
to talk to him.

383
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:00,240
Where're you
going, Mooch?

384
00:29:00,318 --> 00:29:02,047
He's getting a job.

385
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,212
So?

386
00:29:03,288 --> 00:29:05,449
So? He's getting a job!

387
00:29:09,795 --> 00:29:11,729
Campus street car wash.

388
00:29:11,797 --> 00:29:14,231
Going to wait
on college boys.

389
00:29:14,299 --> 00:29:17,735
Don't forget to smile
now if you want a tip.

390
00:29:17,803 --> 00:29:21,000
I thought we were going
to stick together, man.

391
00:29:21,106 --> 00:29:22,733
I need a job, Mike.

392
00:29:22,808 --> 00:29:23,900
Don't go, Mooch.

393
00:29:23,975 --> 00:29:26,739
They only let you out
on weekends and holidays.

394
00:29:26,812 --> 00:29:28,211
See you later, Cyril.

395
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:31,443
Hey, don't forget
to write.

396
00:29:32,651 --> 00:29:33,583
Hey.

397
00:29:33,652 --> 00:29:34,914
Take it easy.

398
00:29:34,986 --> 00:29:36,010
Ciao.

399
00:29:44,496 --> 00:29:45,758
You're a little late,

400
00:29:45,831 --> 00:29:48,595
but I guess you won't
let that happen again.

401
00:29:48,667 --> 00:29:49,759
Sorry.

402
00:29:49,835 --> 00:29:51,427
Here's your
sponge and rag,

403
00:29:51,503 --> 00:29:52,765
and there's your place.

404
00:29:52,838 --> 00:29:55,602
And don't forget
to punch the clock, shorty.

405
00:30:00,345 --> 00:30:01,277
All right!

406
00:30:01,346 --> 00:30:02,404
Bravo!

407
00:30:03,849 --> 00:30:04,781
Yeah!

408
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:06,112
Whoo!

409
00:30:06,184 --> 00:30:07,879
Way to go, Mooch!

410
00:30:16,328 --> 00:30:18,626
You know, them college boys
ain't so smart.

411
00:30:18,697 --> 00:30:23,634
I sold one of my worst cars
to one of them today.

412
00:30:23,702 --> 00:30:26,000
They ain't
too smart.

413
00:30:26,071 --> 00:30:28,904
It's a good thing
that Dave never...

414
00:30:30,942 --> 00:30:32,409
What is this?

415
00:30:33,478 --> 00:30:34,410
It's, um...

416
00:30:34,479 --> 00:30:36,845
sauteed zucchini.

417
00:30:36,915 --> 00:30:38,348
It's "Ity" food.

418
00:30:38,416 --> 00:30:40,816
I don't want
no "Ity" food.

419
00:30:40,886 --> 00:30:41,910
It's not.

420
00:30:41,987 --> 00:30:44,751
I got it at the A & P.

421
00:30:44,823 --> 00:30:46,688
It's like, uh... squash.

422
00:30:46,758 --> 00:30:49,625
I know "Ity" food
when I hear it.

423
00:30:49,694 --> 00:30:51,628
It's all them
"ini" foods...

424
00:30:51,696 --> 00:30:54,164
Zucchini and linguini
and fettuccine.

425
00:30:54,232 --> 00:30:56,564
I want some
American food, damn it!

426
00:30:56,635 --> 00:30:58,068
I want
French fries!

427
00:30:59,337 --> 00:31:01,862
Oh, get off the table,
Fellini!

428
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,066
That's my cat!

429
00:31:03,141 --> 00:31:05,075
His name is Jake,
not Fellini.

430
00:31:05,143 --> 00:31:07,577
I won't have any "ini"
in this house!

431
00:31:07,646 --> 00:31:09,944
Your name is Jake,
you understand?

432
00:31:18,657 --> 00:31:21,592
Your parents asking
what you're going to do?

433
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,594
I think they're
getting curious.

434
00:31:23,662 --> 00:31:26,597
I sure miss
playing basketball.

435
00:31:26,665 --> 00:31:28,599
I got depressed as hell

436
00:31:28,667 --> 00:31:31,602
when my athlete's foot
and jock itch went away.

437
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:35,436
So why did you
give it up?

438
00:31:35,507 --> 00:31:37,839
Oh, I don't know.

439
00:31:39,344 --> 00:31:40,606
Ah...

440
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:43,614
I was sure I was going
to get that scholarship.

441
00:31:43,682 --> 00:31:46,617
My dad, of course,
was sure that I wouldn't.

442
00:31:46,685 --> 00:31:49,119
When I didn't, he was
really understanding, you know?

443
00:31:49,187 --> 00:31:52,122
He loves
to be understanding when I fail.

444
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:55,125
"That's O.K., Cyril.
I understand. "

445
00:31:55,193 --> 00:31:57,627
He even bought me
that guitar

446
00:31:57,696 --> 00:32:00,631
'cause he was sure
I'd never learn to play it.

447
00:32:00,699 --> 00:32:03,566
I'm supposed to take
this college entrance exam.

448
00:32:03,635 --> 00:32:05,068
You're going
to college?

449
00:32:05,136 --> 00:32:06,068
Hell, no!

450
00:32:06,137 --> 00:32:10,073
I just want to see
if I can pass.

451
00:32:10,141 --> 00:32:11,073
Huh.

452
00:32:11,142 --> 00:32:13,576
Maybe I'll take it, too,
and flunk it.

453
00:32:13,645 --> 00:32:16,170
My dad's birthday's
coming up.

454
00:32:17,882 --> 00:32:20,817
Hey, now, look at this.

455
00:32:20,885 --> 00:32:24,184
That's the place
to be right there... Wyoming.

456
00:32:24,289 --> 00:32:28,157
Nothing but prairies and
mountains and nobody around.

457
00:32:28,226 --> 00:32:31,593
All you need
is a bedroll and a good horse.

458
00:32:31,663 --> 00:32:33,096
Don't forget
your toothbrush.

459
00:32:33,164 --> 00:32:35,598
You're still in
your cavity-prone years.

460
00:32:38,169 --> 00:32:39,830
Hey, here's your brother.

461
00:32:46,678 --> 00:32:51,980
I, uh, hear you've been
hot-rodding around campus again.

462
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:53,483
I wasn't
hot-rodding.

463
00:32:53,551 --> 00:32:56,486
I'm going to have
to take the car back

464
00:32:56,554 --> 00:32:58,317
if you keep it up.

465
00:32:59,991 --> 00:33:00,923
All right.

466
00:33:04,162 --> 00:33:05,857
All right,
all right, all right.

467
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:06,862
All right.

468
00:33:06,931 --> 00:33:09,365
How you doing, guys?

469
00:33:09,434 --> 00:33:11,231
Well, we're
a little disturbed

470
00:33:11,336 --> 00:33:13,429
by developments
in the Middle East,

471
00:33:13,505 --> 00:33:14,767
but other than that...

472
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:15,931
Pussy cop.

473
00:33:18,343 --> 00:33:20,573
Hey, I know
what let's do.

474
00:33:20,645 --> 00:33:22,579
Let's drive
to Terre Haute tomorrow.

475
00:33:22,647 --> 00:33:25,081
We ain't been
out of this B-town

476
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:27,084
in God knows
how long.

477
00:33:27,152 --> 00:33:29,586
That sounds
like a good idea.

478
00:33:29,654 --> 00:33:30,586
I'm, uh...

479
00:33:32,157 --> 00:33:33,886
I'm kind of
busy tomorrow.

480
00:33:33,958 --> 00:33:35,585
Yeah,
that's right.

481
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:38,629
I'm kind of busy
myself tomorrow.

482
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:44,762
Well, I just might
go myself, then.

483
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:59,816
<i>§ Ah ah, la da §§</i>

484
00:34:18,169 --> 00:34:19,431
That's it.

485
00:34:19,504 --> 00:34:21,438
Cyril, that's it.
I recognize it.

486
00:34:21,506 --> 00:34:22,495

I haven't
ridden double

544
00:38:07,065 --> 00:38:08,794
since I was
a little girl.

545
00:38:08,866 --> 00:38:11,994
And I've never
been serenaded.

00:38:13,638 --> 00:38:15,071

I'm fýne!

552
00:38:39,097 --> 00:38:42,032
He won't tell me
who did it.

553
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,034
It was dark!

554
00:38:44,102 --> 00:38:48,539
I only know they
all wore Brut aftershave

555
00:38:48,573 --> 00:38:51,041
and reeked
of Lavoris.

556
00:38:51,109 --> 00:38:54,044
Why were you
there by yourself?

557
00:38:54,112 --> 00:38:57,172
I was just
walking.

558
00:38:59,117 --> 00:39:01,984
Well, what kind of car
did they drive?

559
00:39:02,053 --> 00:39:05,989
It was a Mercedes
convertible.

560
00:39:06,057 --> 00:39:08,992
Was it blue?

561
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,220
Yes.

562
00:39:10,328 --> 00:39:13,422
I've seen that car.

563
00:39:13,531 --> 00:39:17,763
They want a fýght,
we'll give them a fýght.

564
00:39:17,835 --> 00:39:19,268
We rednecks are few.

565
00:39:19,337 --> 00:39:23,103
College paleface
students are many.

566
00:39:23,174 --> 00:39:24,664
I counsel peace.

567
00:39:24,776 --> 00:39:27,108
Come on. Let's go fýnd
those bastards.

568
00:39:27,178 --> 00:39:29,009
I have to go
somewhere.

569
00:39:34,285 --> 00:39:36,219
You haven't pledged
any sorority?

570
00:39:36,287 --> 00:39:37,379
No.

571
00:39:37,488 --> 00:39:40,218
You should. Most frat guys
won't date dormies.

572
00:39:40,291 --> 00:39:41,724
I'm the exception.

573
00:39:41,793 --> 00:39:46,059
So, you're on
the swimming team, huh?

574
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:47,757
Yep.

575
00:39:47,865 --> 00:39:49,025
Breaststroke.

579
00:40:07,618 --> 00:40:09,210
I guess.

580
00:40:14,292 --> 00:40:15,418
Who are they?

581
00:40:15,526 --> 00:40:16,959
A bunch of cutters.

582
00:40:17,028 --> 00:40:18,461
What are cutters?

583
00:40:18,529 --> 00:40:20,588
Townies.

584
00:40:25,236 --> 00:40:27,932
There it is.
There's his Mercedes.

585
00:40:28,005 --> 00:40:31,634
Mike, I don't think
we can go in there.

586
00:40:31,743 --> 00:40:34,303
Oh, yeah?
Watch this.

587
00:40:39,751 --> 00:40:41,013
Shit.

588
00:40:41,085 --> 00:40:43,519
<i>Uh, due cappaccino.</i>

589
00:40:43,588 --> 00:40:47,285
Oh, that's
the wrong guy.

590
00:41:01,939 --> 00:41:04,840
A bunch of cutter kids.

591
00:41:14,452 --> 00:41:15,885
There he is.

592
00:41:32,236 --> 00:41:33,168
Hi there.

593
00:41:33,237 --> 00:41:35,671
Would you like
to roll some balls?

594
00:41:44,115 --> 00:41:45,673
Come on, Cyril!

595
00:41:50,621 --> 00:41:52,714
I can't get it out.

596
00:41:55,693 --> 00:41:58,457
My fýnger's stuck.

597
00:42:04,836 --> 00:42:06,770
My papa,
he tells me,

598
00:42:06,838 --> 00:42:07,770

Just like you miss
your mama and papa.

00:42:30,328 --> 00:42:32,796
I... I don't miss them.

609
00:42:32,864 --> 00:42:36,800
I went as far as I could
to get away from them.

610
00:42:36,868 --> 00:42:38,301
They miss you.

611
00:42:38,369 --> 00:42:41,770
At home, they sit,
and they look at your photo,

612
00:42:41,806 --> 00:42:43,296
and they say,

613
00:42:43,407 --> 00:42:46,672
"Ah, how we miss
our Catherina,

614

Oh, sosh.
That's a nice major.

619
00:43:06,831 --> 00:43:08,765
Would you mind if I...

620
00:43:08,833 --> 00:43:11,063
What are you
cutters doing here?

621
00:43:12,837 --> 00:43:14,771
Did you get lost?

622
00:43:14,839 --> 00:43:16,431
No.

623
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:19,031
Then why don't you
get lost now?

624
00:43:22,613 --> 00:43:23,671
Is that him?

625
00:43:26,083 --> 00:43:29,484
Uh... no.
No, I don't think it is.

626
00:43:31,122 --> 00:43:33,113
Let's get
out of here.

627
00:43:33,224 --> 00:43:34,350
Smart move, shorty.

628
00:44:20,638 --> 00:44:22,868
All right!
Break it up!

629
00:44:24,175 --> 00:44:25,767
Oh, shit.

630
00:44:28,312 --> 00:44:29,404
Break it up!

631
00:44:29,513 --> 00:44:30,980
We gotta go now.

632
00:44:31,082 --> 00:44:32,606
Come on.

633
00:44:37,088 --> 00:44:39,022
Cutters started it!

634
00:44:41,993 --> 00:44:44,928
Break it up, everybody.
Get out of there.

635
00:44:45,029 --> 00:44:46,394
Move it!
Let's go!

636
00:44:49,633 --> 00:44:52,625
Most of you will only spend
four years here,

637
00:44:52,737 --> 00:44:56,537
but to a lot of us,
Bloomington is our home.

638
00:44:56,607 --> 00:44:59,633
I don't like how you've
been behaving in my home.

639
00:44:59,744 --> 00:45:03,942
If you feel compelled to compete
with the kids from the town,

640
00:45:04,015 --> 00:45:06,643
you will do it in
a different arena.

641
00:45:06,751 --> 00:45:11,654
We're expanding this year's
Little 500 bicycle race

642
00:45:11,722 --> 00:45:14,384
to include
a team from the town.

643
00:45:14,492 --> 00:45:16,119
But they're not
good enough.

644
00:45:17,962 --> 00:45:22,331
I don't want to be
in the Little 500.

645
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,391
Oh, Christ.

646
00:45:24,502 --> 00:45:27,437
I thought you'd jump
at the chance.

647
00:45:27,505 --> 00:45:31,464
I don't want to be seen
with all those college kids.

648
00:45:31,575 --> 00:45:33,509
That's the point!

649
00:45:33,577 --> 00:45:36,512
Don't you want to beat
those shitheads

650
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:38,377
in front
of everybody?

651
00:45:38,482 --> 00:45:40,882
Doesn't it take four
to have a team?

652
00:45:40,951 --> 00:45:42,384
Well, we got four...

653
00:45:42,453 --> 00:45:44,387
I mean, don't we?

654
00:45:46,323 --> 00:45:49,292
We all enter,
Dave rides the whole thing,

655
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:50,793
and we win!

656
00:45:50,861 --> 00:45:52,158
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.

657
00:45:52,263 --> 00:45:53,195
Uh...

658
00:45:53,264 --> 00:45:54,526
look, Mike.

659
00:45:54,632 --> 00:45:57,100
I'm going to be working
that day, O.K.?

660
00:45:57,201 --> 00:45:58,190
Working?

661
00:45:58,302 --> 00:46:01,135
Yeah, I'm getting a job.

662
00:46:01,205 --> 00:46:02,433
By yourself?

663
00:46:03,541 --> 00:46:06,009
Yeah!
I need the money.

664
00:46:06,077 --> 00:46:08,011
Thanks, Dave.
That's really great.

665
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:09,740
You're a real pal!

666
00:46:09,847 --> 00:46:11,280
You won't be working

667
00:46:11,348 --> 00:46:13,145
the day of
the Italian race.

668
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:17,277
The time comes
when we all have to go our own ways.

669
00:46:17,388 --> 00:46:19,856
You're a real adult,
aren't you?

670
00:46:19,924 --> 00:46:22,484
B- town boy grows up.

671
00:46:22,593 --> 00:46:24,993
It's going to happen
sometime.

672
00:46:25,029 --> 00:46:26,462
Oh, yeah.

673
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:28,464
Is that what
Nancy says?

674
00:46:28,532 --> 00:46:30,659
Just leave her
out of this.

675
00:46:30,768 --> 00:46:33,703
Shut up, would you?
I wasn't talking to you.

676
00:46:33,771 --> 00:46:37,468
Hey, well,
I don't give a damn!

677
00:46:37,575 --> 00:46:40,009
You're not
the quarterback here, Mike!

678
00:46:40,044 --> 00:46:42,012
At least I was once!

679
00:46:42,046 --> 00:46:45,072
Which is better than being
a midget all my life!

680
00:46:45,182 --> 00:46:47,980
Cut it out!
Just cut it out!

681
00:46:56,660 --> 00:46:58,992
<i>Hey, bambino,
che cosa?</i>

682
00:46:59,063 --> 00:47:01,031
Just drop that Italian,
all right?

683
00:47:01,065 --> 00:47:03,499
I'm really sick
of that crap.

684
00:47:04,869 --> 00:47:07,599
Oh, shit!

685
00:47:07,705 --> 00:47:11,141
You're just afraid
of those college guys.

686
00:47:11,208 --> 00:47:13,699
And you're not,
right, Mike?

687
00:47:13,811 --> 00:47:15,745
The only thing
I'm afraid of

688
00:47:15,813 --> 00:47:18,281
is wasting my life
with you guys!

689
00:47:18,382 --> 00:47:20,441
I thought that was
the whole plan,

690
00:47:20,551 --> 00:47:23,452
that we were going
to waste our lives together.

691
00:48:03,928 --> 00:48:05,418
What's he doing?
That guy...

692
00:48:21,679 --> 00:48:23,476
Come on, Rod!

693
00:48:25,149 --> 00:48:26,810
Come on, Mike!

694
00:48:39,763 --> 00:48:41,230
Yay, Rod! Whoo!

695
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:49,900
Come on, Rod!

696
00:48:51,775 --> 00:48:54,175
You can do it!
Come on, Mike!

697
00:49:18,502 --> 00:49:19,833
Yay, Rod!

698
00:49:27,878 --> 00:49:28,936
Uhh!

699
00:49:49,199 --> 00:49:50,257
Mike!

700
00:49:50,367 --> 00:49:52,028
Mike!

701
00:49:52,136 --> 00:49:53,262
Hold on, Mike!

702
00:50:13,057 --> 00:50:15,491
I tried calling her
to tell her,

703
00:50:15,559 --> 00:50:16,992
but I just couldn't.

704
00:50:17,061 --> 00:50:20,997
She's going to see you
in the 500, you know.

705
00:50:23,901 --> 00:50:26,335
You know,
if she really likes you,

706
00:50:26,403 --> 00:50:29,338
she just won't care.

707
00:50:30,908 --> 00:50:32,842
Hey, uh, Dave,
me and Nancy,

708
00:50:32,910 --> 00:50:34,844
we're going
to get married.

709
00:50:34,912 --> 00:50:37,847
Moocher, you're
Catholic, aren't you?

710
00:50:37,915 --> 00:50:38,813
Yeah.

711
00:50:38,916 --> 00:50:40,850
You ever go
to confession?

712
00:50:40,918 --> 00:50:42,351
Twice.

713
00:50:42,419 --> 00:50:44,353
Make you feel better?

714
00:50:44,421 --> 00:50:46,355
Once.

715
00:50:55,432 --> 00:50:57,866
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

716
00:50:57,935 --> 00:50:59,368
You look nice.

717
00:50:59,436 --> 00:51:01,063
Your hair looks great.

718
00:51:03,407 --> 00:51:06,308
What do you think
they're going to ask us?

719
00:51:06,377 --> 00:51:09,312
Nothing we can't answer,
I suppose.

720
00:51:11,415 --> 00:51:14,509
Wonder if I have
to have a job to qualify.

721
00:51:14,618 --> 00:51:17,280
I don't think so.

722
00:51:17,388 --> 00:51:20,323
I think it's mostly
blood and relatives

723
00:51:20,391 --> 00:51:21,824
that they're
interested in.

724
00:51:21,892 --> 00:51:24,326
Great.
I got both of them.

725
00:51:24,395 --> 00:51:26,829
Oh, fudge!
You know what?

726
00:51:26,897 --> 00:51:28,330
No. What?

727
00:51:28,399 --> 00:51:30,833
I only brought $4.00.

728
00:51:30,901 --> 00:51:33,836
Oh, well, it's only 5.

729
00:51:33,904 --> 00:51:36,839
Tell you what.
We'll go Dutch.

730
00:51:36,907 --> 00:51:38,340
On a marriage license?

731
00:51:38,409 --> 00:51:39,876
Sure. Why not?

732
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,097
Papa!

733
00:52:04,201 --> 00:52:05,190
Ciao, Papa!

734
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:16,190
