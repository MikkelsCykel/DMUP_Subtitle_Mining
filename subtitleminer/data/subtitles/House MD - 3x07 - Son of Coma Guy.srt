1
00:00:32,245 --> 00:00:35,875
What are you doing down here? I thought
you usually had lunch with Coma Guy.

2
00:00:35,876 --> 00:00:38,469
This is Vegetative State Guy.
Better company.

3
00:00:39,563 --> 00:00:43,513
Tell him about those Sherpas you dropped
acid with in St. Patrick's Cathedral.

4
00:00:43,866 --> 00:00:47,012
You stole my prescription pad,
and you forged my name.

5
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,080
What did you tell the cop?

6
00:00:51,081 --> 00:00:53,481
I lied. They'd have
put you away for ten years.

7
00:00:53,483 --> 00:00:55,848
After they took your
license to practice medicine.

8
00:00:55,849 --> 00:00:58,995
- So everything's good, then.
- I lied to the cops.

9
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,711
There is no case unless they can prove
that either I got the drugs illegally

10
00:01:02,716 --> 00:01:03,880
or I sold them illegally.

11
00:01:03,893 --> 00:01:06,300
I didn't do the second.
You lied about the first. Game over.

12
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,807
Yeah. Tritter's just playing.

13
00:01:07,971 --> 00:01:10,667
He's gonna see how clever
you are and then just walk away.

14
00:01:10,679 --> 00:01:12,651
The important thing is that
you keep prescribing

15
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:15,081
the same amount of drugs to me,
or it'll look suspicious.

16
00:01:15,156 --> 00:01:18,393
Here's another way to look at it.
Having forced me to lie to the police,

17
00:01:18,395 --> 00:01:21,461
your first concern is
securing your drug connection.

18
00:01:27,417 --> 00:01:28,860
Joining my father for lunch?

19
00:01:29,928 --> 00:01:31,450
I should've called ahead for a table.

20
00:01:31,467 --> 00:01:33,763
- Dr. House was just--
- Enjoying a Reuben.

21
00:01:34,816 --> 00:01:35,762
It's okay.

22
00:01:36,408 --> 00:01:39,802
After ten years, anything that'll
get doctors in the same room as--

23
00:01:41,655 --> 00:01:42,652
What are you doing?

24
00:01:42,785 --> 00:01:44,231
Nothing. What are you doing?

25
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:48,951
Chips?

26
00:01:52,488 --> 00:01:54,132
Wanna see something really cool?

27
00:02:01,508 --> 00:02:03,102
I saw you leaving last Tuesday.

28
00:02:04,425 --> 00:02:06,660
Practically tripped over
two guys on your way out,

29
00:02:06,678 --> 00:02:08,573
but you had no problem opening doors.

30
00:02:08,817 --> 00:02:10,131
It's called akinetopsia.

31
00:02:10,838 --> 00:02:12,680
You can't see things when they move.

32
00:02:12,826 --> 00:02:16,290
And since you haven't been hit by a bus,
I assume that it's intermittent.

33
00:02:16,305 --> 00:02:17,820
It's probably accompanied by seizures,

34
00:02:17,825 --> 00:02:20,972
which made me think that I
could set one off by flashing the--

35
00:02:27,177 --> 00:02:28,420
God, I love this family!

36
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:36,002
Transcript: FRM - Synchro: jh26

37
00:03:07,075 --> 00:03:08,071
I can see fine now.

38
00:03:10,218 --> 00:03:11,513
I've had seizures before.

39
00:03:11,896 --> 00:03:13,540
Most of the time, they're small.

40
00:03:13,605 --> 00:03:15,503
Doctors ran me through all the tests.

41
00:03:15,738 --> 00:03:16,930
Couldn't find anything.

42
00:03:17,408 --> 00:03:19,400
Any history of epilepsy in your family?

43
00:03:19,608 --> 00:03:21,690
The only things I know
that run in my family are

44
00:03:21,698 --> 00:03:24,871
a lot of chutzpah and the
ability to sleep for ten years.

45
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:27,373
Although I'm not really an expert.

46
00:03:27,376 --> 00:03:29,553
Dad never really liked
my mother's side of the family,

47
00:03:29,558 --> 00:03:31,493
and after she died and he came here,

48
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:33,522
I was raised by a guardian.

49
00:03:34,605 --> 00:03:36,801
I wouldn't even know
how to get in touch with him.

50
00:03:36,807 --> 00:03:38,561
How 'bout your father's
side of the family?

51
00:03:38,566 --> 00:03:39,981
Any relatives we could speak with?

52
00:03:39,987 --> 00:03:42,932
My father was an only child.
And my grandparents are dead.

53
00:03:43,108 --> 00:03:47,100
Who did you put down as the person the
hospital should contact in an emergency?

54
00:03:47,355 --> 00:03:48,303
I left it blank.

55
00:03:48,368 --> 00:03:50,152
There's gotta be someone. A friend?

56
00:03:50,165 --> 00:03:51,712
Oh, plenty of friends. Just...

57
00:03:52,156 --> 00:03:54,050
no one that would care if I was here.

58
00:03:56,765 --> 00:03:58,811
Say, do you mind passing me my backpack?

59
00:04:14,047 --> 00:04:14,990
Hair of the dog.

60
00:04:19,096 --> 00:04:21,140
- Could be infection.
- Or a brain tumor.

61
00:04:21,318 --> 00:04:22,260
Says he had a CT.

62
00:04:22,325 --> 00:04:24,051
What's wrong with
the simplest explanation?

63
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:24,733
Trauma.

64
00:04:24,735 --> 00:04:26,132
He didn't report any injuries.

65
00:04:26,137 --> 00:04:28,101
He didn't report being
an alcoholic, either.

66
00:04:28,116 --> 00:04:30,713
Drinking equals falling down,
equals trauma, equals--

67
00:04:30,715 --> 00:04:31,813
Maybe it's inherited.

68
00:04:32,046 --> 00:04:35,262
How would you jump
to genetics from his EEG?

69
00:04:35,747 --> 00:04:38,341
All you've got are some
vaguely epileptiform waves.

70
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:39,800
It's not his EEG.

71
00:04:40,506 --> 00:04:41,452
It's his father's.

72
00:04:41,858 --> 00:04:44,800
When it comes to cortical seizures,
like father, like son.

73
00:04:44,948 --> 00:04:47,913
Small seizures aren't unheard
of in a patient in a vegetative state.

74
00:04:47,917 --> 00:04:49,643
Similarities are interesting, though.

75
00:04:49,647 --> 00:04:51,240
What caused the vegetative state?

76
00:04:51,247 --> 00:04:52,392
His house burned down.

77
00:04:53,358 --> 00:04:54,753
Went back in to get his wife.

78
00:04:54,755 --> 00:04:58,531
Firefighters found him unconscious three
feet from the bedroom, asphyxiated.

79
00:04:58,538 --> 00:04:59,930
Not an inherited condition.

80
00:05:00,407 --> 00:05:01,351
Test his DNA.

81
00:05:02,257 --> 00:05:04,021
Start with adrenomyeloneuropathy.

82
00:05:04,768 --> 00:05:05,761
Check out the home.

83
00:05:13,198 --> 00:05:15,840
- He has a single bed.
- They still make single beds?

84
00:05:16,198 --> 00:05:17,800
Could mean he just doesn't have sex--

85
00:05:17,806 --> 00:05:20,000
though there were
condoms in the apartment.

86
00:05:20,686 --> 00:05:23,180
House asked you to check
out the home for toxins.

87
00:05:23,758 --> 00:05:25,283
No mold, no leaks, no pets.

88
00:05:26,156 --> 00:05:29,200
MRI and LP are both inconclusive.
Infection's still possible.

89
00:05:29,205 --> 00:05:30,881
- Tumor's less likely, but--
- DNA?

90
00:05:30,885 --> 00:05:32,933
Adrenomyeloneuropathy test was negative.

91
00:05:33,315 --> 00:05:36,742
DNA test again. Try Unverricht-Lundborg
and late-onset Lafora's.

92
00:05:36,747 --> 00:05:39,272
Genetic tests take forever.
You can't just keep testing

93
00:05:39,275 --> 00:05:41,351
for every inherited condition
you think it might be.

94
00:05:41,367 --> 00:05:44,113
Well, not me.
I'll be leaving early. But you guys can.

95
00:05:48,488 --> 00:05:52,132
You said no one's been sick, but
what about delivery people, repair guy?

96
00:05:52,155 --> 00:05:53,100
I wouldn't know.

97
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:54,733
I work from home.

98
00:05:55,126 --> 00:05:57,032
Haven't been to the
office in over a month.

99
00:05:57,035 --> 00:05:58,931
- Visitors?
- Haven't had any.

100
00:05:59,517 --> 00:06:03,062
The only person I've seen in the
last week was the pizza delivery guy.

101
00:06:03,138 --> 00:06:04,630
And he looked pretty healthy.

102
00:06:05,538 --> 00:06:07,630
There's gotta be
someone you're close to.

103
00:06:08,428 --> 00:06:09,370
Actually,

104
00:06:10,025 --> 00:06:12,123
the person I see
most often is my father.

105
00:06:13,057 --> 00:06:15,700
He's asleep, so he can't stop me.

106
00:06:20,848 --> 00:06:21,791
What is it?

107
00:06:21,876 --> 00:06:23,672
Just feeling a little nauseous. I--

108
00:06:27,825 --> 00:06:29,260
I think his liver's failing.

109
00:06:29,467 --> 00:06:31,730
Oh, God. Does--does that mean that I'm--

110
00:06:37,526 --> 00:06:41,572
I need a central line kit. Two units of
packed red blood cells, type O negative.

111
00:06:43,415 --> 00:06:47,163
He's unconscious and heading for a coma.
He's at a four on the RLAS scale.

112
00:06:48,677 --> 00:06:49,743
Stop all treatment.

113
00:06:51,005 --> 00:06:53,103
You think this is
a reaction to our meds?

114
00:06:53,266 --> 00:06:55,192
Well, they're obviously not helping.

115
00:06:55,518 --> 00:06:58,593
Given the fact that he's an alcoholic,
there's a good chance his liver wasn't

116
00:06:58,598 --> 00:06:59,512
so hot when he came in.

117
00:06:59,518 --> 00:07:01,952
Anti-seizure drugs could
have just pushed him over the edge.

118
00:07:01,955 --> 00:07:04,500
We take him off those meds,
what do we put him on?

119
00:07:04,567 --> 00:07:05,811
I was hoping you'd know.

120
00:07:05,856 --> 00:07:08,600
May be academic,
but I just started him on dialysis.

121
00:07:09,247 --> 00:07:10,543
Kidney and liver failure.

122
00:07:11,466 --> 00:07:13,032
Not too many people come back from that.

123
00:07:13,035 --> 00:07:15,311
Trauma's out of the picture.
It could still be infection.

124
00:07:15,318 --> 00:07:16,910
- Or neurological.
- Or genetic.

125
00:07:18,418 --> 00:07:19,960
We need a better history.

126
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:24,851
Did you miss the part where
the patient lost consciousness?

127
00:07:26,588 --> 00:07:27,581
L-dopa?

128
00:07:29,277 --> 00:07:30,473
You're not waking Kyle.

129
00:07:30,936 --> 00:07:32,130
You're waking his father.

130
00:07:32,146 --> 00:07:33,991
I commend your observational skills.

131
00:07:34,056 --> 00:07:37,603
You have no reason to think any amount
of drugs will wake a man from a coma.

132
00:07:37,605 --> 00:07:40,631
Vegetative state. Much easier.
This guy's no Terry Schiavo.

133
00:07:40,858 --> 00:07:44,170
His brain's all there. He moves around.
His muscles have barely atrophied.

134
00:07:44,178 --> 00:07:45,923
Just waiting for a fairytale kiss.

135
00:07:46,756 --> 00:07:48,762
After I do that, stick a needle in him.

136
00:07:51,478 --> 00:07:54,122
The amount of amphetamines
alone would be dangerous,

137
00:07:54,285 --> 00:07:56,581
besides whatever the
hell else you've got in there.

138
00:07:56,585 --> 00:07:58,480
There are reports out of South Africa

139
00:07:58,746 --> 00:08:02,550
about a pill that would temporarily
revive someone in a vegetative state.

140
00:08:03,248 --> 00:08:06,493
We've all seen Awakenings.
Made me cry. I wanna cry.

141
00:08:07,767 --> 00:08:08,862
Put the syringe down.

142
00:08:11,075 --> 00:08:13,260
I can out-draw you, mysterious stranger.

143
00:08:13,377 --> 00:08:15,480
We don't experiment
on helpless patients.

144
00:08:15,633 --> 00:08:18,020
Be reasonable.
There's no way this is gonna work.

145
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:20,717
Even if you woke him,
it would only be for a few hours.

146
00:08:20,721 --> 00:08:23,847
A day, two at the most.
You're risking his life.

147
00:08:24,149 --> 00:08:26,952
I'm risking getting sued.
That's the only objection here.

148
00:08:26,955 --> 00:08:29,201
You'll be torturing him. And his family.

149
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:33,200
Good news for legal. The only
family he's got is upstairs dying.

150
00:08:42,595 --> 00:08:45,212
I want this patient monitored
for the next 24 hours.

151
00:08:45,216 --> 00:08:48,383
I want someone with him at all
times to make sure you didn't kill him.

152
00:08:48,386 --> 00:08:50,581
I want your ass in my office--

153
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:54,971
God. I'm starving.

154
00:08:58,217 --> 00:09:00,641
I could really go for a steak.

155
00:09:04,986 --> 00:09:06,132
Do you know your name?

156
00:09:06,855 --> 00:09:08,050
You know where you are?

157
00:09:09,076 --> 00:09:11,922
Gabriel Wozniak.
I don't know the name of this hospital.

158
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:13,651
How much are three and five?

159
00:09:15,066 --> 00:09:16,010
Eight.

160
00:09:16,498 --> 00:09:20,221
Also known as 1/2 of 16,
1/4 of 32, two to the third power.

161
00:09:22,016 --> 00:09:24,962
Coolest thing ever.
Any history of seizure in your family?

162
00:09:25,847 --> 00:09:26,540
No.

163
00:09:26,546 --> 00:09:27,830
- Liver disease?
- No.

164
00:09:28,726 --> 00:09:30,072
How long have I been here?

165
00:09:31,716 --> 00:09:34,010
I got the feeling it's,
um, been a long time.

166
00:09:34,127 --> 00:09:36,623
Interesting.
If your internal clock kept ticking,

167
00:09:37,798 --> 00:09:39,440
how deep does that awareness go?

168
00:09:39,995 --> 00:09:42,360
Pick up scraps of conversations?
You have the vague sense

169
00:09:42,367 --> 00:09:45,012
that the hospital administrator
dresses like a trollop?

170
00:09:45,016 --> 00:09:47,810
Or that the new Star Wars
movies were a disappointment?

171
00:09:50,906 --> 00:09:52,910
I know my wife is dead.

172
00:09:57,785 --> 00:09:59,430
I don't know how long it's been.

173
00:10:03,468 --> 00:10:04,413
Ten years.

174
00:10:10,205 --> 00:10:12,001
What's the last thing you remember?

175
00:10:13,526 --> 00:10:14,470
The fire.

176
00:10:16,286 --> 00:10:19,682
My wife was in the bedroom.
She had taken a sleeping pill. I got...

177
00:10:20,407 --> 00:10:21,351
Kyle out.

178
00:10:21,546 --> 00:10:22,642
Went back in for her.

179
00:10:24,675 --> 00:10:25,961
I knew I didn't make it.

180
00:10:26,836 --> 00:10:27,780
I'm sorry.

181
00:10:28,788 --> 00:10:32,102
What about your wife's side of the
family? Any history of seizures there?

182
00:10:32,106 --> 00:10:34,720
Your son Kyle is a patient here.

183
00:10:35,306 --> 00:10:37,150
I'm afraid his condition is serious.

184
00:10:37,738 --> 00:10:38,682
He may be dying.

185
00:10:42,456 --> 00:10:45,140
No seizure issues on
my wife's side, either.

186
00:10:46,588 --> 00:10:47,732
What about that steak?

187
00:10:48,456 --> 00:10:49,701
Nobody ever answered me.

188
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:58,400
Rumor in the cafeteria was
Caustic Guy was waking up Coma Guy.

189
00:10:59,097 --> 00:11:01,591
Technically,
Vegetative State Guy was woken by...

190
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:04,300
- yeah, Caustic Guy.
- So what happened?

191
00:11:04,306 --> 00:11:07,452
Gotta get him a steak before
I can ask him any more questions.

192
00:11:07,688 --> 00:11:09,180
He doesn't want to talk about his son?

193
00:11:09,187 --> 00:11:12,080
Didn't seem to emotionally
register that his son is sick.

194
00:11:12,136 --> 00:11:15,750
Brain issue? He was asphyxiated,
spent ten years as asparagus.

195
00:11:15,897 --> 00:11:17,263
Who knows what damage is in there?

196
00:11:17,266 --> 00:11:20,412
It's possible. 'Course,
there's always the simple explanation.

197
00:11:20,435 --> 00:11:22,230
Maybe he just doesn't like his son.

198
00:11:22,867 --> 00:11:24,912
Only in your world would that be simple.

199
00:11:24,927 --> 00:11:25,870
The delusion

200
00:11:25,907 --> 00:11:29,323
that fathering a child installs a
permanent geyser of unconditional love--

201
00:11:29,325 --> 00:11:31,842
Maybe your father's feelings
were conditional. Not everyone's--

202
00:11:31,845 --> 00:11:34,810
Yes, well, of course, that would play
into your romantic vision of human--

203
00:11:34,826 --> 00:11:37,731
In terms you would understand,
we have an evolutionary incentive

204
00:11:37,737 --> 00:11:40,902
to sacrifice for our offspring.
Our tribe, our friends.

205
00:11:41,447 --> 00:11:42,393
Keep them safe.

206
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:45,781
Except for all the people who don't.

207
00:11:46,408 --> 00:11:47,851
Everything is conditional.

208
00:11:49,055 --> 00:11:51,502
You just can't always
anticipate the conditions.

209
00:12:02,158 --> 00:12:03,900
Mind if we talk for a few minutes?

210
00:12:05,865 --> 00:12:08,781
How many pills would you say Dr.
House takes a day?

211
00:12:10,278 --> 00:12:12,072
I'm uncomfortable setting a number.

212
00:12:13,415 --> 00:12:14,361
Try.

213
00:12:15,247 --> 00:12:16,192
Six.

214
00:12:17,928 --> 00:12:18,873
A day.

215
00:12:20,878 --> 00:12:22,020
Has he ever had you...

216
00:12:23,085 --> 00:12:24,533
write prescriptions for him?

217
00:12:25,055 --> 00:12:26,941
No. What is it you want me to say?

218
00:12:27,266 --> 00:12:29,723
That he takes too many pills
and is a danger to the hospital?

219
00:12:29,735 --> 00:12:32,682
Or he takes too few because
he's selling them on the side?

220
00:12:33,017 --> 00:12:34,312
Either one is ridiculous.

221
00:12:35,336 --> 00:12:36,331
I meant the former.

222
00:12:37,207 --> 00:12:38,150
You're wrong.

223
00:12:38,518 --> 00:12:42,472
Can I ask what Dr.
House has done to deserve your loyalty?

224
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:46,330
He's not known as a great boss.
He's not even much of a friend.

225
00:12:46,356 --> 00:12:49,071
I mean, look how he left Dr.
Wilson holding the bag.

226
00:12:53,517 --> 00:12:54,462
It's odd.

227
00:12:55,327 --> 00:12:56,671
You don't know about that.

228
00:12:57,265 --> 00:12:58,530
You defend him, and

229
00:12:58,867 --> 00:13:00,011
he won't even tell you

230
00:13:00,785 --> 00:13:02,280
what's happening in his life.

231
00:13:13,907 --> 00:13:14,850
I was paged.

232
00:13:15,608 --> 00:13:16,602
Saw you with a cop.

233
00:13:17,137 --> 00:13:19,372
- What'd he want?
- How many pills does House take,

234
00:13:19,376 --> 00:13:22,222
did I ever write him a prescription,
that sort of stuff.

235
00:13:23,038 --> 00:13:25,390
- I told him six.
- A day, or in a mouthful?

236
00:13:25,395 --> 00:13:27,682
I was just hoping you guys
would stay consistent with--

237
00:13:27,686 --> 00:13:29,871
- He wants to talk to us, too?
- You're next.

238
00:13:32,457 --> 00:13:34,061
We've gotta tell House what's going on.

239
00:13:34,068 --> 00:13:35,811
- Tritter says no.
- Then no it is.

240
00:13:36,038 --> 00:13:38,932
Cops have a thousand ways
to make life difficult for you.

241
00:13:39,508 --> 00:13:41,103
Quick, what's the kid's status?

242
00:13:41,597 --> 00:13:45,392
I gotta get back to our sleeper before
he goes looking for the orgasmatron.

243
00:13:48,466 --> 00:13:51,060
See, if that were rhetorical,
it would mean that I could just

244
00:13:51,066 --> 00:13:54,142
turn around and leave now. Which I'm
not doing. From which you should deduce.

245
00:13:54,145 --> 00:13:56,293
He's off all drugs
except the antibiotics.

246
00:13:56,557 --> 00:13:58,571
His liver's just managing
to hang in there.

247
00:13:58,576 --> 00:14:00,072
He's still sliding into coma.

248
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:14,510
Your barber sucks.

249
00:14:18,446 --> 00:14:20,623
Coma diet. I could make a fortune.

250
00:14:20,928 --> 00:14:22,153
Vegetative state diet.

251
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:24,871
- Who gave you your clothes?
- Dr. Cuddy.

252
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:29,091
I guess I'll need all new ones anyway.
Everything went in the fire.

253
00:14:29,307 --> 00:14:30,602
Ah, don't worry about it.

254
00:14:30,676 --> 00:14:33,811
We use recyclable clothes now.
Wear them once, then eat them.

255
00:14:35,196 --> 00:14:36,842
Your son's measles vaccination.

256
00:14:36,927 --> 00:14:38,981
Do you remember if he
had it and what type it was?

257
00:14:38,986 --> 00:14:41,180
Man, you're a piece of work,
you know that?

258
00:14:43,218 --> 00:14:45,061
You weren't gonna tell me, were you?

259
00:14:45,156 --> 00:14:49,082
I don't need new clothes. Dr. Cuddy
says my body will adjust to the drugs.

260
00:14:49,277 --> 00:14:52,522
That I'll be a vegetable again
by tomorrow. If I'm really lucky,

261
00:14:52,675 --> 00:14:53,623
the day after.

262
00:14:55,365 --> 00:14:56,312
Yeah.

263
00:14:56,936 --> 00:14:57,901
If I got a day to live,

264
00:14:57,906 --> 00:15:00,170
I'm not gonna spend it
in a hospital room being grilled.

265
00:15:00,175 --> 00:15:01,563
Come on, where you gonna go?

266
00:15:02,008 --> 00:15:04,102
Your house burned down.
Your wife's dead.

267
00:15:04,178 --> 00:15:05,322
Business was sold off.

268
00:15:05,775 --> 00:15:07,233
The only thing you have left

269
00:15:07,535 --> 00:15:09,783
is down the hall heading
for a liver biopsy.

270
00:15:11,645 --> 00:15:13,943
Used to be this little,
um, hole in the wall.

271
00:15:15,008 --> 00:15:16,760
Run by a guy named Giancarlo.

272
00:15:18,255 --> 00:15:20,050
Made the best hoagies in the world.

273
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:23,262
Real Italian rolls.
Prosciutto. Provolone.

274
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:28,260
How far is Atlantic City from here?

275
00:15:28,605 --> 00:15:31,813
You have one day to live.
And you want a sandwich.

276
00:15:32,118 --> 00:15:33,963
People on Death Row get a last meal.

277
00:15:34,197 --> 00:15:35,141
State provides it.

278
00:15:36,128 --> 00:15:37,371
Who's providing for you?

279
00:15:38,065 --> 00:15:39,351
You got a car? Money?

280
00:15:41,387 --> 00:15:42,863
You're negotiating with me.

281
00:15:49,288 --> 00:15:50,931
Take out another hundred for me.

282
00:15:51,827 --> 00:15:52,873
And I need your car.

283
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:56,112
- I'm not doing you any favors.
- You'll get it back tomorrow.

284
00:15:56,187 --> 00:15:58,353
Two days, max. Road trip.

285
00:16:06,245 --> 00:16:09,021
This is like trying to control
the weather, but I'd prefer it

286
00:16:09,026 --> 00:16:11,723
if you didn't eat in the car.
I just had it detailed.

287
00:16:12,126 --> 00:16:13,932
- I drive.
- Oh, the hell he does.

288
00:16:14,085 --> 00:16:15,031
Sure.

289
00:16:15,878 --> 00:16:18,882
Aside from the fact he just
woke up from a vegetative state,

290
00:16:18,888 --> 00:16:20,152
the guy doesn't have a license.

291
00:16:20,156 --> 00:16:22,390
How 'bout this? Cops stop us, we lie.

292
00:16:22,838 --> 00:16:24,082
You know how to do that.

293
00:16:24,435 --> 00:16:25,380
Chips.

294
00:16:28,505 --> 00:16:30,351
It's all the drugs
pumping through his system.

295
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:33,020
Right now, his reflexes are
better than Dale Earnhardt Jr.'s.

296
00:16:33,036 --> 00:16:33,980
Hey, what's this?

297
00:16:34,516 --> 00:16:35,512
It says, "Ipp-odd."

298
00:16:38,737 --> 00:16:39,683
I'm coming.

299
00:16:47,355 --> 00:16:49,150
So let's talk about toxic exposure.

300
00:16:52,667 --> 00:16:55,513
What was wrong with the old colors?
I trusted brown.

301
00:16:56,688 --> 00:16:58,782
Do the purple ones
have chocolate inside?

302
00:16:58,785 --> 00:16:59,771
Raspberry cocaine.

303
00:17:00,685 --> 00:17:02,831
This house that burned down.
Where was it?

304
00:17:03,168 --> 00:17:04,362
Moorestown, New Jersey.

305
00:17:04,588 --> 00:17:08,412
Listen, I really need to know about the
candy because I'm allergic to berries.

306
00:17:08,418 --> 00:17:09,440
You didn't mention that.

307
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,200
- Is it significant?
- No.

308
00:17:12,157 --> 00:17:15,302
So where else did you live?
List everywhere, including vacations.

309
00:17:15,308 --> 00:17:17,182
Start with when your wife got pregnant.

310
00:17:17,188 --> 00:17:20,430
We lived in Jersey. Then we
moved to Jersey. From there, Jersey.

311
00:17:20,768 --> 00:17:23,842
What are you waiting to hear?
About the little cottage in the Amazon

312
00:17:23,847 --> 00:17:26,240
with the mosquitoes and
the lead paint all over the walls?

313
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:27,190
Yes.

314
00:17:28,308 --> 00:17:30,132
You know what?
I didn't let you come along

315
00:17:30,135 --> 00:17:32,982
so you could suck all the
fun out of my one day of life.

316
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:36,472
Well, you're outta luck,
'cause that's totally why I'm here.

317
00:17:38,655 --> 00:17:39,603
O kay.

318
00:17:39,905 --> 00:17:40,850
Rule change.

319
00:17:41,985 --> 00:17:44,433
Person with the money makes the rules.
Or in this case,

320
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:47,883
the person who's friends with the
person with the money makes the rules.

321
00:17:47,886 --> 00:17:50,231
Well, you want answers
more than I want money.

322
00:17:50,717 --> 00:17:52,261
All right, so here's the game.

323
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:55,740
Ask whatever you want.
But for every question I answer,

324
00:17:56,247 --> 00:17:57,743
you have to answer one first.

325
00:17:58,176 --> 00:18:00,380
And why would you care
about anything I have to say?

326
00:18:00,385 --> 00:18:03,360
The day before I died,
I was a successful man.

327
00:18:04,138 --> 00:18:07,392
I had a factory with over 200 employees.

328
00:18:07,685 --> 00:18:09,230
People listened when I talked.

329
00:18:10,018 --> 00:18:11,902
I liked power.

330
00:18:13,697 --> 00:18:15,832
Now the only power I have left

331
00:18:16,716 --> 00:18:18,342
is the power to annoy you.

332
00:18:25,616 --> 00:18:27,412
Took Wilson's assistant for coffee.

333
00:18:27,785 --> 00:18:29,490
- Why?
- Something Tritter said.

334
00:18:30,288 --> 00:18:32,150
She told me the police think that House

335
00:18:32,155 --> 00:18:34,800
stole Wilson's prescription
pad and forged his name.

336
00:18:36,628 --> 00:18:37,573
You... believe it?

337
00:18:39,496 --> 00:18:40,172
Do you?

338
00:18:40,188 --> 00:18:43,031
Oh, absolutely. I do.
I'm just checking how naive you are.

339
00:18:43,036 --> 00:18:45,680
He's not gonna steal his best
friend's pad, jeopardize his career.

340
00:18:45,687 --> 00:18:47,582
Until his best friend says no to him.

341
00:18:48,076 --> 00:18:51,973
House is a junkie. Junkies do whatever
they have to do to get what they need.

342
00:18:54,605 --> 00:18:56,701
Kyle's down to a
three on the RLAS scale.

343
00:18:57,865 --> 00:18:59,763
He's only showing localized response.

344
00:19:00,626 --> 00:19:03,571
I'll call House. Tell him
we're gonna need an answer soon.

345
00:19:06,066 --> 00:19:07,942
Get in your right lane for 295.

346
00:19:09,267 --> 00:19:10,610
And pass me the Twizzlers.

347
00:19:15,007 --> 00:19:16,601
- I'm curious.
- No, you're not.

348
00:19:16,735 --> 00:19:18,312
Why would a man's first instinct

349
00:19:18,315 --> 00:19:20,591
be to drive away from
the only family he's got?

350
00:19:20,598 --> 00:19:23,492
No! This is no time
for you to do your thing.

351
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:25,390
We don't care about his state of mind.

352
00:19:25,405 --> 00:19:28,563
We don't care if he's happy. This
factory of yours. What did you make?

353
00:19:32,807 --> 00:19:33,901
So ask me a question.

354
00:19:35,005 --> 00:19:35,953
I'm thinking.

355
00:19:36,456 --> 00:19:37,801
Only six left, by the way.

356
00:19:37,997 --> 00:19:40,661
So sign my name.
You don't need a doctor. You need a pen.

357
00:19:40,665 --> 00:19:41,910
What is up with you two?

358
00:19:41,995 --> 00:19:44,890
Wilson lied to the bulls
to keep me out of the big house.

359
00:19:45,335 --> 00:19:48,132
- Are you out of your mind?
- Well, who's he gonna tell?

360
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:51,500
By tomorrow night, he's gonna
be a mindless stalk of celery.

361
00:19:51,948 --> 00:19:54,340
Since I answered that one,
by the way, my turn.

362
00:19:54,686 --> 00:19:56,183
What did you make in your factory?

363
00:19:56,186 --> 00:19:57,131
Luxury boats.

364
00:19:59,028 --> 00:20:00,420
Have you ever been in love?

365
00:20:00,787 --> 00:20:04,652
Going right for the closets with
the embarrassing stuff. Good move. Yes.

366
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:06,200
Describe the boats.

367
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:09,993
35- to 65-foot hulls. Twin engines,
parquet floors in the galleys,

368
00:20:10,116 --> 00:20:11,710
staterooms with queen beds.

369
00:20:13,117 --> 00:20:14,060
How'd you meet?

370
00:20:14,537 --> 00:20:15,483
She shot me.

371
00:20:15,898 --> 00:20:19,292
These boats. I assume you used
mildew-resistant paint on the hulls?

372
00:20:19,308 --> 00:20:20,251
Naturally.

373
00:20:20,258 --> 00:20:21,202
Shot you?

374
00:20:21,847 --> 00:20:22,792
Paintball.

375
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:24,321
Doctors versus lawyers.

376
00:20:24,987 --> 00:20:26,530
You ever take your son to the factory?

377
00:20:26,535 --> 00:20:29,933
Sure. He used to run all over the place,
but it was perfectly safe.

378
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:32,842
Ever love anybody else?

379
00:20:34,127 --> 00:20:36,331
No more questions. I got my answer.

380
00:20:36,947 --> 00:20:40,330
While Dad's in the office,
son's watching them spray-paint.

381
00:20:40,807 --> 00:20:42,151
And what kid wears a mask?

382
00:20:42,538 --> 00:20:45,300
Mercury specifically targets
the central nervous system.

383
00:20:45,306 --> 00:20:46,643
Are you saying this was my fault?

384
00:20:46,647 --> 00:20:48,690
Mercury poisoning explains the seizures.

385
00:20:48,838 --> 00:20:51,991
The liver is like a big soup strainer.
Soup runs through.

386
00:20:52,215 --> 00:20:54,973
Chicken dumplings stay. For soup,
read blood. For chicken dumplings--

387
00:20:54,977 --> 00:20:56,721
I get it, I get it. Mercury.

388
00:20:56,967 --> 00:21:00,812
Sits more or less idle until your kid
pours tequila shooters into his liver.

389
00:21:01,768 --> 00:21:05,010
When the liver goes, takes
out the kidneys. Explains everything.

390
00:21:05,346 --> 00:21:06,290
Yeah, it's me.

391
00:21:06,366 --> 00:21:08,813
Foreman, draw blood.
Test for mercury poisoning.

392
00:21:09,448 --> 00:21:12,840
Chase. Start heavy metal chelation
while we're waiting for results.

393
00:21:13,798 --> 00:21:15,563
Chase isn't here. I'll start the--

394
00:21:15,818 --> 00:21:16,761
Where is he?

395
00:21:18,915 --> 00:21:19,860
The lab.

396
00:21:24,557 --> 00:21:26,303
How many pills does he take a day?

397
00:21:27,237 --> 00:21:30,373
It's hard to say.
Pain levels vary over time.

398
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:33,733
Could be six, eight, ten.

399
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:36,352
Ever write any prescriptions for him?

400
00:21:36,475 --> 00:21:37,540
- Yes.
- Why?

401
00:21:38,056 --> 00:21:39,052
Did he tell you to?

402
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:41,153
He asked me to.

403
00:21:48,885 --> 00:21:49,831
Medicine...

404
00:21:50,457 --> 00:21:54,471
attracts people who
are attracted to power.

405
00:21:55,525 --> 00:21:59,180
I know how he hates when
he is defied by a patient.

406
00:22:00,465 --> 00:22:03,623
I doubt he handles defiance
from his staff any better.

407
00:22:04,118 --> 00:22:05,813
Now, you correct me if I'm wrong.

408
00:22:06,187 --> 00:22:09,553
But I don't think Dr.
House asks for anything.

409
00:22:10,778 --> 00:22:12,383
I think he takes it.

410
00:22:12,868 --> 00:22:17,150
And I think that you
are stuck lying to the police

411
00:22:18,868 --> 00:22:20,110
to cover up something...

412
00:22:21,347 --> 00:22:22,491
you didn't want to do.

413
00:22:30,906 --> 00:22:33,700
We have been up and down St.
James like a Monopoly car.

414
00:22:33,968 --> 00:22:34,912
It's not here.

415
00:22:35,275 --> 00:22:37,021
Giancarlo has left the building.

416
00:22:41,658 --> 00:22:43,773
We could still turn around
and go back to Princeton.

417
00:22:43,778 --> 00:22:46,013
No! We've come this far.
I'm getting the hoagie.

418
00:22:49,398 --> 00:22:51,471
If your son does have mercury poisoning,

419
00:22:51,475 --> 00:22:53,632
there's a good chance
he'll respond to the chelation.

420
00:22:53,638 --> 00:22:56,113
You might be able to have a
few min with him before you lapse.

421
00:22:56,115 --> 00:22:57,843
Why are you so concerned about me?

422
00:22:59,327 --> 00:23:02,023
Deep inside,
Wilson believes that if he cares enough,

423
00:23:02,358 --> 00:23:03,602
he'll never have to die.

424
00:23:04,588 --> 00:23:06,251
Your behavior isn't normal.

425
00:23:07,218 --> 00:23:08,563
And you would know normal.

426
00:23:08,627 --> 00:23:11,821
What could he have done that
you won't forgive after ten years,

427
00:23:11,935 --> 00:23:13,481
when this is your last chance?

428
00:23:15,166 --> 00:23:17,011
My son is what he is.

429
00:23:17,467 --> 00:23:18,410
His mother's side?

430
00:23:18,807 --> 00:23:19,801
All drunken losers.

431
00:23:21,556 --> 00:23:22,750
He's gone the same way.

432
00:23:24,576 --> 00:23:27,521
House told you that drinking
had damaged your son's liver.

433
00:23:27,847 --> 00:23:28,791
I just said that.

434
00:23:29,127 --> 00:23:32,420
But you didn't hear him say
that till after we left the hospital.

435
00:23:32,717 --> 00:23:34,000
So why did you leave?

436
00:23:36,518 --> 00:23:38,410
Maybe your son takes after your side.

437
00:23:39,736 --> 00:23:42,311
Seizures and an allergy
to emotional connections.

438
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:43,752
Okay, okay, okay. Enough.

439
00:23:45,085 --> 00:23:47,620
We're in Atlantic City,
and my time's not up yet.

440
00:23:48,166 --> 00:23:50,022
We'll find a hotel with a casino.

441
00:23:56,815 --> 00:23:57,963
BP's starting to drop.

442
00:23:58,988 --> 00:24:00,212
O2-sat's down to 70.

443
00:24:05,145 --> 00:24:06,820
0.3 milligrams of epi in.

444
00:24:06,827 --> 00:24:08,801
What are you trying to do?
Make him bleed faster?

445
00:24:08,807 --> 00:24:09,661
Check the pulse.

446
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:12,111
It's not his liver.

447
00:24:14,098 --> 00:24:15,043
It's the heart.

448
00:24:16,698 --> 00:24:19,992
I understand he's a French chef,
but I'm sure he can handle this.

449
00:24:20,385 --> 00:24:23,131
We need a 12-inch Italian roll,
oregano vinegar--

450
00:24:23,578 --> 00:24:26,383
No. Not balsamic vinegar.
Oregano vinegar.

451
00:24:27,435 --> 00:24:29,563
Quid pro quo, Clarice.

452
00:24:30,405 --> 00:24:31,353
Game's still on.

453
00:24:31,715 --> 00:24:33,912
I thought the answer
was mercury poisoning.

454
00:24:34,026 --> 00:24:36,101
What other questions
would you care about?

455
00:24:36,108 --> 00:24:38,622
If you each had one day to live,
you'd look for one last meal,

456
00:24:38,627 --> 00:24:40,721
and House would look
for one last answer.

457
00:24:42,218 --> 00:24:45,812
No, can you just send the ingredients
up here? And I'll make it myself.

458
00:24:47,298 --> 00:24:48,242
Last ten years.

459
00:24:49,298 --> 00:24:51,790
- How much awareness did you have?
- I don't know.

460
00:24:52,088 --> 00:24:53,632
I knew it wasn't the next day.

461
00:24:54,217 --> 00:24:55,162
I knew that--

462
00:24:56,668 --> 00:24:57,910
I recognized your voice.

463
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:00,791
How often were you in my room?

464
00:25:01,175 --> 00:25:02,912
No. You're wasting a question.

465
00:25:03,805 --> 00:25:04,852
I have a better one.

466
00:25:06,806 --> 00:25:09,350
- Why steal my pad?
- Oh, my God. You're right.

467
00:25:10,006 --> 00:25:10,951
I'm an addict.

468
00:25:11,257 --> 00:25:12,651
Thanks for opening my eyes.

469
00:25:12,875 --> 00:25:14,391
No, I mean, why my pad?

470
00:25:15,075 --> 00:25:18,021
Foreman, Cameron,
and Chase's pads are just as convenient.

471
00:25:18,138 --> 00:25:21,170
But their association with
you is involuntary. They're employees.

472
00:25:21,176 --> 00:25:23,020
I associate with you through choice.

473
00:25:23,055 --> 00:25:24,922
And any relationship
that involves choice

474
00:25:24,925 --> 00:25:27,671
you have to see how far
you can push before it breaks.

475
00:25:27,757 --> 00:25:28,703
This is easy.

476
00:25:29,025 --> 00:25:32,251
You ask the questions,
answer them, and make tasty snacks.

477
00:25:33,447 --> 00:25:34,690
Let's go try the casino.

478
00:25:35,427 --> 00:25:37,261
And one day, our friendship will break.

479
00:25:37,268 --> 00:25:40,691
And that'll just prove your theory
that relationships are conditional,

480
00:25:40,695 --> 00:25:43,421
and you don't need human connection,
or deserve it,

481
00:25:43,555 --> 00:25:46,153
or whatever goes on in
that rat maze of your brain.

482
00:25:46,867 --> 00:25:49,142
Sorry. If I'd known he
was gonna be this annoying,

483
00:25:49,148 --> 00:25:52,092
I would've stolen Dr.
Cameron's pad and Dr. Foreman's car.

484
00:25:52,667 --> 00:25:55,110
At least she appreciates
my brooding melancholy.

485
00:25:56,075 --> 00:25:58,470
House's House of Whining.
State your complaint.

486
00:25:58,958 --> 00:26:00,950
Patient's BP just dropped like a stone.

487
00:26:00,987 --> 00:26:03,300
Do an echo.
Mercury isn't likely to damage--

488
00:26:03,386 --> 00:26:05,681
It didn't. Mercury test was negative.

489
00:26:08,377 --> 00:26:09,323
Do an echo.

490
00:26:15,918 --> 00:26:18,612
I was wrong. Your son's still dying.

491
00:26:19,648 --> 00:26:22,380
I need to go over every
relative you ever had again.

492
00:26:22,836 --> 00:26:25,930
This time, forget their diseases.
Just tell me how they died.

493
00:26:25,975 --> 00:26:27,671
We don't have time to take turns.

494
00:26:27,707 --> 00:26:29,932
Gimme the answers.
You get a big one at the end.

495
00:26:29,937 --> 00:26:33,832
You go for whatever you want.
Destroy my privacy, my dignity.

496
00:26:38,665 --> 00:26:39,611
Your grandmother?

497
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:43,283
Heat exhaustion.
Fourth of July picnic. The woman was 92.

498
00:26:43,926 --> 00:26:46,352
Does anyone in the kitchen
know the hoagie shop

499
00:26:46,436 --> 00:26:48,143
that used to be on St. James Place?

500
00:26:48,147 --> 00:26:50,041
Your sister-in-law with the diabetes.

501
00:26:50,285 --> 00:26:51,832
As far as you know, is she still alive?

502
00:26:51,836 --> 00:26:55,170
She's not. Killed in a traffic accident
driving home from a Phillies game.

503
00:26:55,177 --> 00:26:57,770
I'm sure a lot of beer was consumed.
Phillies lost.

504
00:26:57,925 --> 00:26:58,870
Your father?

505
00:26:58,925 --> 00:27:00,793
Old age. Heart finally gave out.

506
00:27:01,455 --> 00:27:02,453
Your wife's father?

507
00:27:02,557 --> 00:27:04,893
Hit-and-run.
Walking the incontinent dog.

508
00:27:06,057 --> 00:27:07,550
Uh, hi. Do you guys deliver?

509
00:27:09,738 --> 00:27:13,633
Let me put it this way. If you deliver,
there'll be a $100 tip in it for you.

510
00:27:14,906 --> 00:27:15,853
Excellent!

511
00:27:16,668 --> 00:27:17,610
Victory.

512
00:27:17,717 --> 00:27:19,862
Ha, ha, the night
is finally going my way.

513
00:27:20,256 --> 00:27:21,450
Wilson, toss me a soda.

514
00:27:36,785 --> 00:27:38,333
Shall we go somewhere to talk?

515
00:27:39,647 --> 00:27:40,592
House is an ass.

516
00:27:40,955 --> 00:27:42,951
But he obviously needs pain medication.

517
00:27:43,196 --> 00:27:47,091
How much pain one person feels is not
a call the government should be making.

518
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:50,220
So you think I'm a bureaucrat
with a badge following some

519
00:27:50,388 --> 00:27:51,440
arbitrary guideline.

520
00:27:52,226 --> 00:27:53,431
Yeah. I do.

521
00:27:54,248 --> 00:27:55,692
So you're saying I should...

522
00:27:55,958 --> 00:27:56,902
just trust him.

523
00:27:57,708 --> 00:27:58,462
Do you?

524
00:27:58,467 --> 00:28:01,912
- You're not qualified to make that--
- I'm not sure you are, either.

525
00:28:02,185 --> 00:28:03,683
I've been a cop for 20 years,

526
00:28:04,068 --> 00:28:06,562
and not a day goes by
that someone doesn't try to

527
00:28:07,067 --> 00:28:09,330
sell me some self-serving story.

528
00:28:10,485 --> 00:28:12,033
If you had my job, you'd know.

529
00:28:13,897 --> 00:28:15,123
Everybody lies.

530
00:28:22,846 --> 00:28:24,593
Think you've run out of relatives.

531
00:28:25,636 --> 00:28:27,002
So. It's my turn.

532
00:28:32,305 --> 00:28:35,161
- Why did you become a doctor?
- That's the big question?

533
00:28:36,477 --> 00:28:40,110
I gave you complete license to humiliate
me, and that's the best you can do?

534
00:28:40,115 --> 00:28:43,122
Well, okay. Let's discuss
the wonder of the human body.

535
00:28:43,276 --> 00:28:44,223
No, no, no.

536
00:28:44,298 --> 00:28:45,393
You're a curious guy.

537
00:28:46,127 --> 00:28:48,970
You like to figure things out.
Why not go into research?

538
00:28:48,998 --> 00:28:50,640
Why work with people when you...

539
00:28:51,617 --> 00:28:52,901
obviously hate people?

540
00:28:54,935 --> 00:28:57,492
Oedipal fixation.
I was seeking my mother's love,

541
00:28:57,607 --> 00:28:59,993
and she thought that Ben
Casey was just the dreamiest--

542
00:28:59,998 --> 00:29:03,291
Okay, fine. You don't think
you'll need any more answers from me?

543
00:29:03,845 --> 00:29:04,892
Give me a hard time.

544
00:29:14,805 --> 00:29:15,793
When I was 14,

545
00:29:17,657 --> 00:29:19,352
my father was stationed in Japan.

546
00:29:20,605 --> 00:29:24,500
I went rock climbing with this kid
from school. He fell, he got injured,

547
00:29:24,586 --> 00:29:26,580
and I had to bring him to the hospital.

548
00:29:28,636 --> 00:29:32,181
We came in through the wrong entrance
and passed this guy in the hall.

549
00:29:34,385 --> 00:29:35,331
It was a janitor.

550
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:38,450
My friend came down
with an infection and

551
00:29:38,695 --> 00:29:40,490
the doctors didn't know what to do.

552
00:29:41,348 --> 00:29:42,443
So they brought in...

553
00:29:44,396 --> 00:29:45,380
the janitor.

554
00:29:48,656 --> 00:29:49,601
He was a doctor.

555
00:29:51,575 --> 00:29:53,240
And a Buraku.

556
00:29:54,956 --> 00:29:56,700
One of Japan's untouchables.

557
00:29:58,498 --> 00:29:59,910
His ancestors had been

558
00:30:00,546 --> 00:30:02,203
slaughterers, gravediggers.

559
00:30:03,726 --> 00:30:04,671
And this guy,

560
00:30:06,878 --> 00:30:09,472
he knew that he wasn't accepted
by the staff. Didn't even try.

561
00:30:09,477 --> 00:30:12,422
He didn't dress well.
He didn't pretend to be one of them.

562
00:30:14,158 --> 00:30:15,752
The people that ran that place,

563
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,741
they didn't think that
he had anything they wanted.

564
00:30:20,987 --> 00:30:22,431
Except when they needed him.

565
00:30:24,226 --> 00:30:25,491
Because he was right.

566
00:30:27,987 --> 00:30:29,981
Which meant that nothing else mattered.

567
00:30:31,745 --> 00:30:33,290
And they had to listen to him.

568
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:45,410
Thank you.

569
00:30:49,195 --> 00:30:51,443
Need 20 milligrams
of diazepam in a syringe.

570
00:30:59,385 --> 00:31:01,032
Heartbeat's irregular and accelerating.

571
00:31:01,038 --> 00:31:02,670
- It's at 200.
- He's gonna crash.

572
00:31:02,677 --> 00:31:05,240
- Allergic reaction to the diazepam?
- Better hope so.

573
00:31:05,247 --> 00:31:07,191
It's either that, or his heart's done.

574
00:31:15,188 --> 00:31:17,180
What happened on the night of the fire?

575
00:31:21,217 --> 00:31:23,902
Yeah, I'm sure it's a
stressful emotional question.

576
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:25,662
Suck it up.

577
00:31:29,316 --> 00:31:31,861
My wife had taken a sleeping
pill and gone to bed.

578
00:31:31,976 --> 00:31:33,620
It was Christmas Eve. I let Kyle

579
00:31:33,987 --> 00:31:35,831
pop corn in the fireplace. He

580
00:31:37,117 --> 00:31:38,062
managed to...

581
00:31:39,026 --> 00:31:40,271
knock loose some tinder.

582
00:31:40,957 --> 00:31:42,503
Wrapping paper caught on fire.

583
00:31:42,685 --> 00:31:44,460
Spread. So fast.

584
00:31:45,418 --> 00:31:46,361
I got Kyle out.

585
00:31:47,988 --> 00:31:49,481
And when I went back in for--

586
00:31:54,215 --> 00:31:55,461
You're a disappointment.

587
00:31:57,566 --> 00:32:00,530
You act as though you
don't need anybody. You--

588
00:32:01,026 --> 00:32:03,172
You just blame your
son for what happened.

589
00:32:03,185 --> 00:32:05,963
I don't blame him.
He was a 12-year-old boy.

590
00:32:05,976 --> 00:32:07,910
You don't blame a kid for an accident.

591
00:32:07,915 --> 00:32:10,101
Then what are we doing here?
Why aren't you with him?

592
00:32:10,105 --> 00:32:14,580
Because it wouldn't matter!
I failed to keep my family safe!

593
00:32:14,867 --> 00:32:18,242
I couldn't stop the fire.
I couldn't save my wife!

594
00:32:18,568 --> 00:32:22,141
Now you want me to stick around
watching while I fail to save my son.

595
00:32:22,326 --> 00:32:24,292
Thank you so much for waking me up.

596
00:32:32,038 --> 00:32:33,931
How did your son dislodge the tinder?

597
00:32:40,036 --> 00:32:41,641
He dropped the popcorn tray.

598
00:32:42,136 --> 00:32:45,331
He had been complaining it
was too heavy. I should've listened.

599
00:32:45,418 --> 00:32:48,221
And the hit-and-run.
Walking the pissy dog.

600
00:32:49,018 --> 00:32:50,111
That happen at night?

601
00:32:50,728 --> 00:32:51,873
I think so, yeah. Why?

602
00:32:52,257 --> 00:32:55,330
Car accident after the Phillies lost.
Night game?

603
00:32:58,677 --> 00:32:59,931
Ragged red fiber.

604
00:33:00,598 --> 00:33:02,042
It's an inherited condition.

605
00:33:02,086 --> 00:33:04,730
Dropping things, muscle weakness.
Poor night vision.

606
00:33:05,218 --> 00:33:08,560
Makes people seem uncoordinated,
accident-prone, careless.

607
00:33:09,248 --> 00:33:11,330
It's transmitted in mitochondrial DNA.

608
00:33:11,695 --> 00:33:13,590
So it only passes through the mother.

609
00:33:13,598 --> 00:33:16,140
Your wife's family weren't drunks.
They were sick.

610
00:33:17,207 --> 00:33:18,981
It wouldn't have affected his liver.

611
00:33:18,985 --> 00:33:19,980
The kid is a drunk.

612
00:33:20,537 --> 00:33:24,003
He thinks that he killed his mother
and turned his father into a vegetable.

613
00:33:24,007 --> 00:33:26,150
You know,
I might have a few shots myself.

614
00:33:27,447 --> 00:33:28,390
Foreman.

615
00:33:28,435 --> 00:33:30,940
Test his DNA for ragged red fiber.

616
00:33:31,675 --> 00:33:33,262
- It's not gonna--
- Here's a thought.

617
00:33:33,267 --> 00:33:36,360
Why don't we not assume that the test
is negative until we actually do it?

618
00:33:36,365 --> 00:33:37,311
House.

619
00:33:37,785 --> 00:33:39,673
The kid has severe cardiomyopathy.

620
00:33:40,706 --> 00:33:42,963
Alcoholic. No shot at a transplant.

621
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:46,951
So yeah, maybe you figured out why.
Good for you, but...

622
00:33:48,395 --> 00:33:49,540
he's gonna die anyway.

623
00:34:16,297 --> 00:34:17,790
I want to give Kyle my heart.

624
00:34:22,248 --> 00:34:23,191
This thing--

625
00:34:23,597 --> 00:34:24,543
whatever it is--

626
00:34:25,197 --> 00:34:27,890
you said he gets it from the mother.
My heart's fine.

627
00:34:28,326 --> 00:34:31,230
And it could go on being
fine for the rest of your life.

628
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:32,750
Yeah.

629
00:34:32,868 --> 00:34:35,000
It's not like he's
gonna do anything with it.

630
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:36,402
Well, you woke him up once.

631
00:34:36,418 --> 00:34:38,963
Maybe someone will come
up with some other answer.

632
00:34:39,467 --> 00:34:41,811
We've both seen breakthroughs
no one expected.

633
00:34:43,656 --> 00:34:46,622
And ragged red fiber's treatable,
but not curable.

634
00:34:47,407 --> 00:34:49,900
Even if he gets your heart,
there's no guarantee.

635
00:34:52,625 --> 00:34:53,572
He's my kid.

636
00:34:55,687 --> 00:34:58,671
No. Did you really
expect a different answer?

637
00:34:58,956 --> 00:35:02,512
We have arranged transplants
before when a patient is near death.

638
00:35:02,815 --> 00:35:06,730
Except he isn't near death. He's saying,
"Kill me and cut out my heart."

639
00:35:07,395 --> 00:35:08,691
Are you out of your mind?

640
00:35:10,335 --> 00:35:12,133
Fine. I'll think of something else.

641
00:35:14,467 --> 00:35:15,413
I'm sorry.

642
00:35:31,515 --> 00:35:32,462
Wilson.

643
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:34,700
Get out.

644
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:38,801
No.

645
00:35:43,075 --> 00:35:45,023
You've lied to the cops enough for me.

646
00:35:49,456 --> 00:35:51,751
Maybe I don't wanna
push this till it breaks.

647
00:36:15,348 --> 00:36:17,272
Pills are the simplest.

648
00:36:21,308 --> 00:36:23,803
Hanging has less chance
of damaging the heart.

649
00:36:27,598 --> 00:36:28,592
I'm okay with pain.

650
00:36:31,237 --> 00:36:33,681
Strangulation is better
than breaking your neck.

651
00:36:35,626 --> 00:36:37,071
Which means this'll be slow.

652
00:36:41,208 --> 00:36:44,622
I wouldn't get to see him
even if we got in the car right now

653
00:36:44,697 --> 00:36:47,141
and broke the speed
limit driving back, would I?

654
00:36:48,645 --> 00:36:49,591
No.

655
00:36:52,786 --> 00:36:53,731
Tell him--

656
00:37:03,347 --> 00:37:04,893
I don't know what to tell him.

657
00:37:12,448 --> 00:37:14,701
Think it's my turn to ask a question,
isn't it?

658
00:37:14,718 --> 00:37:15,662
I don't think so.

659
00:37:16,336 --> 00:37:19,280
'Cause you just asked me
that thing about the speed limit.

660
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:24,061
What do you wanna know?

661
00:37:24,937 --> 00:37:28,131
If you could hear one thing
from your father, what would it be?

662
00:37:30,595 --> 00:37:31,690
It wouldn't help you.

663
00:37:31,775 --> 00:37:32,722
Try me.

664
00:37:38,735 --> 00:37:39,882
I'd want him to say...

665
00:37:43,796 --> 00:37:44,743
"You were right.

666
00:37:46,706 --> 00:37:48,051
"You did the right thing."

667
00:37:51,097 --> 00:37:52,041
Yeah.

668
00:37:52,618 --> 00:37:53,562
It doesn't help.

669
00:38:13,985 --> 00:38:15,103
I'm Dr. Wilson.

670
00:38:16,086 --> 00:38:17,080
I'm Mrs. Schaeffer.

671
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:19,083
I'm from Princeton.

672
00:38:21,005 --> 00:38:24,103
My husband and I and our
three children live in Philadelphia.

673
00:38:28,037 --> 00:38:28,982
So, uh...

674
00:38:30,415 --> 00:38:31,573
do you like to swing?

675
00:38:34,578 --> 00:38:35,520
No.

676
00:38:36,598 --> 00:38:38,141
Well, if you change your mind,

677
00:38:38,705 --> 00:38:39,653
I'm in--

678
00:38:41,625 --> 00:38:43,231
House. House!

679
00:38:43,866 --> 00:38:45,781
Is it room 622? 642?

680
00:38:46,608 --> 00:38:47,553
622.

681
00:38:48,587 --> 00:38:49,533
622.

682
00:38:50,337 --> 00:38:51,280
Yeah.

683
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:08,320
Alibi.

684
00:39:11,336 --> 00:39:12,281
I figured.

685
00:40:00,045 --> 00:40:02,543
They found an open bottle
of aspirin by the body.

686
00:40:04,687 --> 00:40:05,930
Lucky he had a headache.

687
00:40:06,715 --> 00:40:08,711
Reduced trauma to the heart in transit.

688
00:40:10,985 --> 00:40:11,931
Lucky.

689
00:40:24,948 --> 00:40:25,891
That can't be all.

690
00:40:28,046 --> 00:40:29,691
Well, you got a heart out of it.

691
00:40:30,035 --> 00:40:32,120
How many organs do
you want from the guy?

692
00:40:32,125 --> 00:40:34,321
I mean, my father
must have said something.

693
00:40:35,515 --> 00:40:36,463
He couldn't just--

694
00:40:37,335 --> 00:40:40,031
He must have given you
some kind of a message for me.

695
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:47,723
He said you were right.

696
00:40:48,908 --> 00:40:50,152
You did the right thing.

697
00:40:55,905 --> 00:40:56,852
Right about what?

698
00:40:59,687 --> 00:41:00,733
What does that mean?

699
00:41:02,366 --> 00:41:03,310
How would I know?

700
00:41:04,165 --> 00:41:05,110
He's your dad.

701
00:41:18,135 --> 00:41:20,681
You know what I found
interesting about this case?

702
00:41:21,216 --> 00:41:23,801
That it proved that people
can love unconditionally,

703
00:41:23,818 --> 00:41:26,063
and you can tell yourself
it's not true, but

704
00:41:26,095 --> 00:41:29,001
you'll just end up in a hotel
room in Atlantic City asking someone

705
00:41:29,015 --> 00:41:30,911
- to cut your heart out?
- The hoagie.

706
00:41:32,208 --> 00:41:35,171
You thought this guy was emotionally
confused and that the hoagie

707
00:41:35,177 --> 00:41:38,122
was just a mask to hide
his real feelings towards his son.

708
00:41:39,225 --> 00:41:40,171
It was.

709
00:41:40,878 --> 00:41:43,663
Did you know Tritter was talking
to your team while we were away?

710
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:44,610
Yeah.

711
00:41:44,986 --> 00:41:47,630
And yet you moved heaven
and earth to get him that mask

712
00:41:47,636 --> 00:41:49,262
with mustard and prosciutto.

713
00:41:49,656 --> 00:41:51,051
Which one of them told you?

714
00:41:51,197 --> 00:41:52,142
All of them.

715
00:41:52,687 --> 00:41:54,453
Which means that none
of them said anything

716
00:41:54,455 --> 00:41:56,142
I have to worry about.
Back to the hoagie.

717
00:41:56,425 --> 00:41:58,573
You think that my
addiction's out of hand.

718
00:41:58,676 --> 00:42:02,443
Your need to be needed is so strong
that you'll give people what they want,

719
00:42:02,447 --> 00:42:04,281
what they need,
what they think they need.

720
00:42:04,288 --> 00:42:07,831
I don't think my enabling is anything
you should be complaining about.

721
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,353
Yes, my name is Dr. James Wilson.

722
00:42:11,348 --> 00:42:13,522
Account number 835687.

723
00:42:14,808 --> 00:42:16,483
The ATM says I've got zero--

724
00:42:18,965 --> 00:42:20,460
What does that mean-- a hold?

725
00:42:23,866 --> 00:42:25,350
Yeah, okay. Thanks.

726
00:42:31,435 --> 00:42:34,950
My accounts have been frozen
as part of a police investigation.

727
00:42:38,847 --> 00:42:40,642
They can't keep your money forever.

728
00:42:42,355 --> 00:42:46,151
No, they can keep it till I agree to
help send you to prison for ten years.

729
00:42:52,078 --> 00:42:53,220
You're getting dinner.

730
