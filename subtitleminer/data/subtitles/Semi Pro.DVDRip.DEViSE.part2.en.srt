1
00:00:00,468 --> 00:00:02,629
Dishes off to Scootsie.

2
00:00:02,671 --> 00:00:05,969
But look at this, Jackie Moon
blocks his own teammate's shot!

3
00:00:06,007 --> 00:00:08,065
A loose ball on the court,
Vakidis gets it.

4
00:00:08,108 --> 00:00:11,271
No!

5
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:32,291
God damn it, Vakidis!

6
00:00:32,334 --> 00:00:34,029
Learn fuckin' English!

7
00:00:35,837 --> 00:00:40,103
Corn dogs, Jackie!
Corn dogs for all these people.

8
00:00:40,141 --> 00:00:44,578
The Tropics win,
and this crowd is going crazy.

9
00:00:44,612 --> 00:00:46,807
Crazy for corn dogs.

10
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:51,785
And Jackie Moon gives us
a victory lap right out the door!

11
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:52,980
# Get up and dance to the music! #

12
00:00:53,021 --> 00:00:54,386
Now, Scootsie, rotate up top.

13
00:00:54,422 --> 00:00:57,789
Vakidis, flash to the high post.

14
00:00:57,826 --> 00:01:01,353
No, to the high post, Vakidis.
Help him.

15
00:01:01,396 --> 00:01:03,125
Good.

16
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:09,397
- At guard...
- # Dance to the music #

17
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:11,132
...formerly known as Clarence Withers...

18
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:14,471
- and "Downtown Funky Stuff" Malone...
- # Dance to the music #

19
00:01:14,509 --> 00:01:16,136
...and Sugar Dunkerton.

20
00:01:16,177 --> 00:01:18,076
- # Dance to the music #
- He's tryin' out his new name tonight.

21
00:01:18,112 --> 00:01:20,206
Put your hands together for...

22
00:01:20,248 --> 00:01:23,341
- # Dance to the music #
...Coffee Black.

23
00:01:23,385 --> 00:01:25,079
Coffee Black!

24
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:27,814
# Dance to the music #

25
00:01:27,855 --> 00:01:31,585
# You might like to hear
the horns blowin' #

26
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:35,082
# Cynthia on the throne, yeah! #

27
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,097
Now let's do it again. Jab.

28
00:01:41,135 --> 00:01:43,126
Swing, back.

29
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,899
Good.

30
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,234
That's it.

31
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:57,015
# Dance to the music #

32
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:01,051
# Dance to the music #

33
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:03,948
# Dance to the music #

34
00:02:05,826 --> 00:02:08,658
Here they come, the Flint Tropics
Ball Girls cheerleading squad,

35
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:11,256
keeping the crowd energized
through the timeout.

36
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:12,457
They've just got such big...

37
00:02:12,498 --> 00:02:14,399
- What?
- Hearts.

38
00:02:14,435 --> 00:02:16,095
- Yes.
- Big, bouncy, jiggly hearts.

39
00:02:16,135 --> 00:02:17,625
Well, hearts don't really bounce...

40
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,662
so now I think you're talking
about something else, Lou.

41
00:02:21,507 --> 00:02:23,600
- # Say it! Get up! #
- Yeah!

42
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:27,841
Downtown brings the ball up forward and
passes to Monix at the top of the key.

43
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:30,042
Behind his back to Doubleday.

44
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,550
Scootsie goes for the three-pointer...

45
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:33,245
and it is good!

46
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:36,112
Are you actually havin' fun out here,
Monix?

47
00:02:36,155 --> 00:02:38,180
Hey, don't tell anybody.

48
00:02:49,001 --> 00:02:52,095
# Dance to the music #

49
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:55,274
# Dance to the music #

50
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:56,468
# Yeah, yeah, yeah #

51
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:59,000
# Dance to the music #

52
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,890
Well, if it isn't
the toast of Flint, Michigan.

53
00:03:19,932 --> 00:03:23,868
Shouldn't you be out signing
autographs somewhere or somethin'?

54
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,900
- Will you marry me?
- Shut up.

55
00:03:30,943 --> 00:03:33,036
I'm crazy about you.
You know that.

56
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,478
Do I?

57
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:36,846
You came to one of our games.

58
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,875
Don't think I didn't see you
hiding in the upper deck.

59
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:44,413
- So?
- So let's do this, Lynn. You and me.

60
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:48,120
You know, like back in the day.

61
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:52,655
You know? I mean not then, because
I was an asshole. Better, right?

62
00:03:52,698 --> 00:03:54,563
For real this time.

63
00:03:57,603 --> 00:03:59,400
I need you.

64
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,633
Yo, Monix!

65
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:07,806
What's up, man?
Hey, check out the jersey. I'm you!

66
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:10,077
Yeah.

67
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:13,776
- Hey, Kyle?
- Yeah.

68
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:15,582
Can you do me a big favor?

69
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:18,646
Can you go get me a tube of Bengay?

70
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:23,685
Are you kidding me?
I'd be honored, man. I'll leave right now.

71
00:04:23,728 --> 00:04:24,717
What do you think you're doing?

72
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:25,889
- Hey, Kyle?
- Yeah!

73
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,456
Listen, don't... Kyle?

74
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,298
- Yeah!
- Don't go to the pharmacy.

75
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:33,862
I need one of those big tubes like
you get at Luger's out on Route 59.

76
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:36,271
I'm already gone, big man!

77
00:04:41,313 --> 00:04:44,510
Hey, Lynn.
Forgot my stupid wallet.

78
00:04:50,021 --> 00:04:51,990
That's it.

79
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,795
Yes.

80
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:04,063
# Baby, keep on #

81
00:05:05,904 --> 00:05:08,464
# Come on, baby,
keep on doin' it #

82
00:05:10,475 --> 00:05:11,772
# Right on #

83
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:15,108
# Right on doin' it #

84
00:05:16,548 --> 00:05:18,312
# You got it together #

85
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:19,375
# Baby, keep on #

86
00:05:19,418 --> 00:05:21,476
# Oh, you got it together, baby #

87
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:23,716
# Right on #

88
00:05:23,755 --> 00:05:24,915
# Keep on doin' it #

89
00:05:24,956 --> 00:05:27,891
# And I'll give you,
baby, all that I get #

90
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:31,558
- Kyle.
- # Keep on #

91
00:05:33,098 --> 00:05:36,000
- Fuck!
- Monix!

92
00:05:36,034 --> 00:05:37,399
You old dog.

93
00:05:37,435 --> 00:05:39,300
- What the hell are you doin'?
- Nothin', man.

94
00:05:39,337 --> 00:05:42,569
I'm just sittin' here watching...
and stuff.

95
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:43,938
I'm outta here.

96
00:05:43,975 --> 00:05:47,467
Come on, man, don't be like that.
It's all cool.

97
00:05:47,512 --> 00:05:51,278
No, man. No, believe me, it's not cool.

98
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:53,045
I'll call you.

99
00:05:53,084 --> 00:05:54,745
OK.

100
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,615
He was talkin' to me.

101
00:06:00,358 --> 00:06:01,586
Yes, ladies and gentlemen...

102
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:04,254
Jackie Moon has outdone himself
with this promotion...

103
00:06:04,296 --> 00:06:08,062
as he prepares to jump
over 47 feet of Ball Girls.

104
00:06:08,099 --> 00:06:10,932
- # Rollercoaster #
- # Say, what? #

105
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:14,598
The fact that Jackie's
never been on roller skates before...

106
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,437
appears to have done nothing
to diminish his confidence.

107
00:06:16,474 --> 00:06:19,341
- # Rollercoaster #
- All right, folks.

108
00:06:19,377 --> 00:06:20,639
Here comes...

109
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,944
- # Rollercoaster #
...Jackie!

110
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:26,644
Here he comes down the ramp.

111
00:06:26,685 --> 00:06:30,086
- He is airborne!
- Shit!

112
00:06:30,122 --> 00:06:33,057
- No!
- Lord!

113
00:06:36,361 --> 00:06:39,387
- Jackie's up!
- # Rollercoaster! #

114
00:06:40,565 --> 00:06:42,033
- Great job!
- # Rollercoaster! #

115
00:06:42,067 --> 00:06:44,194
And everyone survives!

116
00:06:44,235 --> 00:06:46,135
That was exciting!

117
00:06:47,372 --> 00:06:49,567
- # Of love #
- That's an adrenaline rush.

118
00:06:49,608 --> 00:06:50,598
# Rollercoaster #

119
00:06:50,642 --> 00:06:54,237
Next time I'm gonna jump
even more girls.

120
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:58,716
- What?
- The Commissioner just called again.

121
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,651
- Commish?
- He's drivin' up here on Monday.

122
00:07:01,685 --> 00:07:04,051
- He's comin' to Flint?
- Yes, he's comin' to Flint.

123
00:07:04,088 --> 00:07:06,579
Shit. Crap.

124
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:11,485
- You all right?
- Yeah.

125
00:07:11,528 --> 00:07:14,725
You know, Jackie, we need
2,000 fans in those stands.

126
00:07:14,765 --> 00:07:17,598
We can't fake it this time.
We gotta do somethin'.

127
00:07:17,635 --> 00:07:19,194
Look, it's no problem.
I'll take care of it.

128
00:07:19,236 --> 00:07:21,500
Yeah? We've tried everything.

129
00:07:21,538 --> 00:07:23,062
Look, I said I'll handle it, OK?

130
00:07:23,108 --> 00:07:25,769
- I'll think of somethin'.
- All right.

131
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:27,538
Back in 30 seconds.

132
00:07:27,579 --> 00:07:30,342
- How's your wife doin'?
- She's doing just super.

133
00:07:30,382 --> 00:07:31,678
- She's gorgeous. Yeah.
- Really...

134
00:07:31,716 --> 00:07:33,911
- Thank you, I think. I mean...
- I'd be...

135
00:07:33,951 --> 00:07:36,442
...hands off.
- I'll try.

136
00:07:36,487 --> 00:07:37,682
- OK.
- No guarantees.

137
00:07:37,721 --> 00:07:39,245
Really?

138
00:07:39,289 --> 00:07:40,950
I'd like a guarantee.

139
00:07:40,991 --> 00:07:42,459
Are we back, Chuck?
We're back.

140
00:07:42,493 --> 00:07:44,961
OK. Welcome back
to Tropics Weekly.

141
00:07:44,995 --> 00:07:47,930
I'm joined by owner/player/coach
Jackie Moon.

142
00:07:47,966 --> 00:07:50,264
Jackie, it is always an honor
when you can drop by.

143
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,790
Always enjoy our time together,
Dick Pepper.

144
00:07:52,937 --> 00:07:53,925
Dick Pepperfield, actually.

145
00:07:53,971 --> 00:07:54,961
Now, Jackie...

146
00:07:55,005 --> 00:07:59,305
amazingly, you're two wins away
from getting your team to the NBA.

147
00:07:59,343 --> 00:08:03,144
How do you intend to match up
to the Squires' strong inside game?

148
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,647
It's a great question.

149
00:08:04,682 --> 00:08:09,745
Tomorrow, after the game,
I, Jackie Moon, will wrestle a bear.

150
00:08:10,754 --> 00:08:12,551
Well, that's something...

151
00:08:12,589 --> 00:08:15,080
but defensively, as a team,
how do you...

152
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:17,093
That's tomorrow night,
one night only...

153
00:08:17,127 --> 00:08:19,721
watch Dewie the Wrestling Bear
attack me...

154
00:08:19,764 --> 00:08:21,822
and he's killed people in public before.

155
00:08:21,865 --> 00:08:23,457
Well, OK, that is some entertainment...

156
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,128
and you are known for
your creative promotions, Jackie, but...

157
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:27,798
You're not gonna
want to miss this, folks...

158
00:08:27,838 --> 00:08:30,534
and if you're a small child, you creep
into your mama's bedroom at night...

159
00:08:30,574 --> 00:08:32,406
and you lift about 40 bucks...

160
00:08:32,444 --> 00:08:33,706
- outta your mom's purse...
- No, no, no.

161
00:08:33,745 --> 00:08:37,203
...and you walk down to Flint
Fairgrounds Coliseum, eight o'clock!

162
00:08:37,248 --> 00:08:40,376
There ya have it. Jackie Moon,
thanks so much for joining us.

163
00:08:40,418 --> 00:08:43,080
Dewie's insane!
He could rip my head off!

164
00:08:45,523 --> 00:08:49,926
I'm Dick Pepperfield, reminding you
there will be another night.

165
00:08:49,961 --> 00:08:52,020
Good night, Flint.

166
00:08:52,063 --> 00:08:55,191
Jackie, are you really
gonna wrestle a bear?

167
00:08:55,233 --> 00:08:58,896
- Dick, you're the best.
- And we're clear.

168
00:08:58,937 --> 00:09:01,497
- Let's go get some pussy.
- Gosh, I don't know.

169
00:09:01,539 --> 00:09:04,167
- Really?
- Yeah.

170
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:06,507
- I shouldn't. You know, I shouldn't.
- But you want to.

171
00:09:06,544 --> 00:09:10,605
Yes, I said I cannot say no to you. We
are gonna get some pussy, aren't we?

172
00:09:10,648 --> 00:09:12,479
It's gonna be fun.

173
00:09:14,552 --> 00:09:16,281
Come on!

174
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,886
I'm scared, Clarence.

175
00:09:19,924 --> 00:09:22,984
It's a baby bear.
It's trained and everything.

176
00:09:23,027 --> 00:09:26,656
I don't care. I'm terrified of those things.
I'm freakin' out.

177
00:09:26,698 --> 00:09:28,188
Come on, get it together.

178
00:09:28,233 --> 00:09:31,066
I'm startin' to feel really dizzy.

179
00:09:31,102 --> 00:09:32,399
Break his neck! Come on!

180
00:09:32,437 --> 00:09:34,667
- Wanna call it off?
- No! No.

181
00:09:34,706 --> 00:09:37,197
OK.
I gotta give these people a show.

182
00:09:37,242 --> 00:09:39,506
- Are you guys ready?
- Uh-huh.

183
00:09:39,544 --> 00:09:42,307
- You have to give me your safe word.
- No, I don't need a safe word.

184
00:09:42,347 --> 00:09:46,807
OK, I'll tell you what, if you feel
like you're in danger, just say...

185
00:09:48,253 --> 00:09:49,241
spumoni.

186
00:09:49,286 --> 00:09:52,016
No, I don't need spumoni, OK?
Let's get this show on the road.

187
00:09:52,689 --> 00:09:54,451
Bobby Dee.

188
00:09:58,961 --> 00:10:02,523
- Let's go!
- Go... Go... Go ahead, man.

189
00:10:04,902 --> 00:10:07,234
What are you afraid of?

190
00:10:07,871 --> 00:10:09,429
Hey.

191
00:10:11,108 --> 00:10:13,269
We're both wearing red.

192
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:16,541
- Sorry, I'm not ignoring you. I'm just...
- That's stupid, Jackie!

193
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:19,105
...trying to deal with him right now.

194
00:10:19,149 --> 00:10:20,514
How long you been
working with the bear?

195
00:10:20,551 --> 00:10:22,542
Just like a day or so.

196
00:10:22,586 --> 00:10:23,985
What?

197
00:10:24,021 --> 00:10:26,854
But I've been working with cats
for like 12 years.

198
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:29,757
So I'm very familiar with animals.

199
00:10:29,793 --> 00:10:31,761
Great.

200
00:10:31,795 --> 00:10:33,456
- C'mon!
- Hey, Dewie.

201
00:10:34,431 --> 00:10:37,059
Fuck that shit!

202
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,431
I'm outta here. Spumoni.

203
00:10:38,468 --> 00:10:41,631
No, nope. No, no.
You can't quit now. We just started.

204
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,169
We got to give these people
a show, man.

205
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:46,642
- Yeah, you're right.
- That guy's a pussy!

206
00:10:46,677 --> 00:10:50,134
Test him out.
I'm just gonna be right over here.

207
00:10:51,114 --> 00:10:53,081
- Do something!
- Come on, Dewie.

208
00:10:53,116 --> 00:10:55,084
You're just nothin' but a dumb bear.

209
00:10:55,118 --> 00:10:57,450
Smack, smack. Yep.

210
00:10:59,756 --> 00:11:02,384
Crazy fists. I'm comin' with crazy fists.

211
00:11:04,427 --> 00:11:06,988
Yeah. This is fine,
he's not doing anything.

212
00:11:12,269 --> 00:11:14,134
Flint, can you dig it?

213
00:11:14,171 --> 00:11:16,162
Jackie Moon Flint...

214
00:11:16,206 --> 00:11:18,299
Shit!

215
00:11:23,313 --> 00:11:25,713
Dewie!

216
00:11:25,749 --> 00:11:26,807
Spumoni!

217
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:28,783
One round. No spumoni!

218
00:11:28,819 --> 00:11:30,650
Fuck you, Clarence! Spumoni!

219
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:32,177
Dewie, no!

220
00:11:33,257 --> 00:11:35,987
Bobby Dee, help! Shit! Spumoni!

221
00:11:45,235 --> 00:11:48,363
Watch my hair! Watch my hair!

222
00:11:48,405 --> 00:11:52,171
The only thing I care about
is my hair! Watch it!

223
00:11:52,209 --> 00:11:54,677
Dewie! My hair!

224
00:11:54,711 --> 00:11:57,544
Spumoni! Spumoni!

225
00:11:58,415 --> 00:12:01,441
How many times
do I gotta say spumoni?

226
00:12:01,485 --> 00:12:04,283
- Somebody's got to do something.
- I wouldn't go in there if I were you.

227
00:12:04,321 --> 00:12:06,881
Don't worry, Jackie!
I'm coming, Jackie.

228
00:12:06,924 --> 00:12:08,585
I'm comin', Jackie.

229
00:12:14,631 --> 00:12:17,191
Turn on the lights! Turn on the lights!

230
00:12:18,402 --> 00:12:20,131
Good.

231
00:12:20,804 --> 00:12:24,432
Nobody move. Nobody move.

232
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:28,637
Where are you, precious?

233
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:31,307
Dewie?

234
00:12:31,348 --> 00:12:34,317
Everyone just remain seated.

235
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:36,545
I think he left.

236
00:12:36,585 --> 00:12:37,574
Dewie?

237
00:12:40,756 --> 00:12:42,656
Everybody panic!

238
00:12:42,692 --> 00:12:46,685
My God, there's a bear
loose in the Coliseum!

239
00:12:46,729 --> 00:12:48,855
There will be no refunds!

240
00:12:48,898 --> 00:12:51,992
Your refund will be escaping
this deathtrap with your life!

241
00:12:52,033 --> 00:12:54,594
If you have a small child,
use it as a shield!

242
00:12:54,637 --> 00:12:56,331
They love the tender meat.

243
00:12:56,372 --> 00:12:59,830
Cover your sodas, Dewie loves sugar.

244
00:13:01,344 --> 00:13:05,246
- Hey, Jackie.
- Hey, Commish.

245
00:13:06,349 --> 00:13:08,044
What do ya think?
Packed house, right?

246
00:13:08,084 --> 00:13:10,780
I need to speak with you
and the rest of the team, Jackie.

247
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:14,119
OK. Locker room? All right.

248
00:13:14,156 --> 00:13:17,785
This whole merger thing
has been really complicated.

249
00:13:17,826 --> 00:13:22,287
It's taken a lot of my time
out of my life, away from my family.

250
00:13:23,099 --> 00:13:27,536
Look, even if you beat the Spurs
on Saturday...

251
00:13:28,971 --> 00:13:31,906
the Tropics won't be going
to the NBA next year.

252
00:13:31,941 --> 00:13:33,772
Come on, man.

253
00:13:33,809 --> 00:13:35,401
What the hell
are you talkin' about?

254
00:13:35,444 --> 00:13:39,244
The expansion committee had
an emergency meeting in Manhattan...

255
00:13:39,281 --> 00:13:43,741
and they decided that Flint
just isn't a big enough media market.

256
00:13:43,786 --> 00:13:47,017
Well, tough shit!
We done made it this far.

257
00:13:47,056 --> 00:13:48,045
And rules is rules.

258
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:50,956
Guys, it's over.

259
00:13:50,993 --> 00:13:52,984
There's nothing I can do.

260
00:13:55,531 --> 00:13:59,797
Jackie, I'm man enough
to admit when I'm wrong.

261
00:14:00,802 --> 00:14:04,239
I never thought you'd pull it off.
But you did.

262
00:14:06,942 --> 00:14:08,500
Good luck.

263
00:14:09,345 --> 00:14:10,710
Right.

264
00:14:10,746 --> 00:14:15,649
Jackie, this is the type of deal
you can work around, ain't it?

265
00:14:16,852 --> 00:14:20,344
Yeah, you Jackie Moon. I mean,
you can just make a phone call, right?

266
00:14:22,491 --> 00:14:25,460
Sorry, guys. I let you down.

267
00:14:26,929 --> 00:14:28,521
I'm nothin' but a big phony.

268
00:14:28,564 --> 00:14:31,829
Man, don't talk like that.
You ain't no phony.

269
00:14:32,735 --> 00:14:36,831
Yes, I am. You know my song
Love Me Sexy?

270
00:14:36,872 --> 00:14:37,998
Of course, yeah.

271
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,804
Yeah, everybody loves that song, man.
It was number one in the country.

272
00:14:40,843 --> 00:14:42,174
I stole it.

273
00:14:42,211 --> 00:14:44,145
No.

274
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,080
It's true.

275
00:14:46,115 --> 00:14:50,245
My mom wrote it on a napkin three
weeks before she died, and I stole it.

276
00:14:51,287 --> 00:14:55,552
That song bought me this franchise
and everything I have in the world...

277
00:14:55,591 --> 00:14:58,890
but it's all fake.

278
00:15:00,062 --> 00:15:03,657
Well, look, you can write another
song. I know it's in your bones. Right?

279
00:15:03,699 --> 00:15:07,157
Don't be crazy. I can't write a song
as brilliant as Love Me Sexy.

280
00:15:07,203 --> 00:15:09,137
You're right.

281
00:15:09,171 --> 00:15:11,537
I just wish I could puke this all away.

282
00:15:14,343 --> 00:15:16,675
Monix, can you punch me
in the jejunum?

283
00:15:18,214 --> 00:15:19,545
Monix?

284
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:27,049
# Qué será, será #

285
00:15:27,088 --> 00:15:28,919
In a new merger-policy shift...

286
00:15:28,956 --> 00:15:32,984
it seems the Tropics will not
be playing for an NBA berth after all.

287
00:15:33,027 --> 00:15:35,518
Saturday's matchup
against the first-place Spurs...

288
00:15:35,563 --> 00:15:38,759
will be the Tropics'
final basketball game.

289
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,927
And in an act of great sacrifice...

290
00:15:40,969 --> 00:15:43,631
Jackie Moon has helped
Tropics' superstar, Coffee Black...

291
00:15:43,671 --> 00:15:45,468
realize his NBA dreams...

292
00:15:45,507 --> 00:15:46,531
by trading him to the Spurs.

293
00:15:46,574 --> 00:15:51,307
Clarence baby, you made it!
You made it, Clarence, you made it!

294
00:15:51,346 --> 00:15:53,711
Yes.

295
00:15:55,783 --> 00:15:58,809
# Qué será #

296
00:15:59,153 --> 00:16:01,622
# Qué será #

297
00:16:01,956 --> 00:16:04,424
# Girl #

298
00:16:07,362 --> 00:16:09,922
# Qué será #

299
00:16:11,065 --> 00:16:16,662
For Lou Redwood, I'm Dick Pepperfield
reminding you there will be another...

300
00:16:16,704 --> 00:16:20,367
No, actually we're down to our last night.

301
00:16:21,809 --> 00:16:22,798
Shit.

302
00:16:31,686 --> 00:16:33,483
Sup, chief?

303
00:16:33,521 --> 00:16:35,148
Hey.

304
00:16:41,229 --> 00:16:42,890
What are you doing here?

305
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,565
If you ain't heard, I got traded.

306
00:16:47,602 --> 00:16:49,263
Yeah.

307
00:16:49,304 --> 00:16:51,670
Coffee Black headin' to the NBA.

308
00:16:52,774 --> 00:16:54,935
Big time.

309
00:16:54,975 --> 00:16:58,173
Yeah, I just wanted to let you know,
man, this year, you coaching us...

310
00:16:58,213 --> 00:16:59,441
the way you did it,
you really made us feel...

311
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,142
No, no, no, no.

312
00:17:02,182 --> 00:17:03,445
Don't.

313
00:17:04,219 --> 00:17:05,379
OK.

314
00:17:09,557 --> 00:17:12,082
Let me ask you somethin', Monix.

315
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:13,753
Yup.

316
00:17:13,795 --> 00:17:15,456
You already played for the NBA.

317
00:17:16,364 --> 00:17:19,059
Your knee is gone...

318
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:22,661
you couldn't give a damn about the
merger, you were gonna retire anyway.

319
00:17:22,703 --> 00:17:25,104
What's the question?

320
00:17:25,139 --> 00:17:27,835
What you playin' for?

321
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,307
I just wanna sit here
and have a beer in peace.

322
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:36,646
Yeah?

323
00:17:42,222 --> 00:17:43,554
All right.

324
00:17:46,294 --> 00:17:48,159
I just thought you'd wanna hear that.

325
00:17:48,196 --> 00:17:49,959
Have a good one.

326
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:07,609
# Baby, are you ready
to lick me sexy? #

327
00:18:07,649 --> 00:18:08,638
Jackie, where you at?

328
00:18:08,682 --> 00:18:12,174
# I'm a big faker
and I stole this song-ly sexy #

329
00:18:13,987 --> 00:18:17,889
# I wanna kill myself-y sexy #

330
00:18:19,459 --> 00:18:25,021
# I'm gonna get an extension cord
and hang myself sexy #

331
00:18:25,065 --> 00:18:27,932
Buddy. What are you doin'?

332
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:32,665
Right now I'm urinating on myself.

333
00:18:34,574 --> 00:18:38,509
Listen, Jackie, I never thanked you.

334
00:18:38,545 --> 00:18:41,980
- For what?
- For helpin' me find basketball again.

335
00:18:46,452 --> 00:18:49,422
Now what is it... Don't eat that.

336
00:18:49,456 --> 00:18:52,186
- What is that?
- Pancake.

337
00:18:52,225 --> 00:18:55,854
- Has that been there?
- It's been here a while.

338
00:18:55,895 --> 00:18:59,923
Listen, Jackie, I think
you should call a team meeting.

339
00:18:59,966 --> 00:19:01,456
Why?

340
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:05,198
'Cause you're still the leader
of the Tropics. Can you do that?

341
00:19:09,276 --> 00:19:10,265
OK.

342
00:19:11,878 --> 00:19:13,105
You're a good man.

343
00:19:14,648 --> 00:19:16,047
Should we...

344
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,778
I hate to see this go to waste.
This little bit.

345
00:19:18,818 --> 00:19:22,846
It won't go to waste.
Save that for the next guy.

346
00:19:25,826 --> 00:19:27,726
If I could have
everyone's attention, please.

347
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,557
Well...

348
00:19:29,596 --> 00:19:33,395
I just wanted to take one last time
to say thank you to all of you...

349
00:19:33,432 --> 00:19:38,096
for all your hard work
as part of the Flint Tropics.

350
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:44,936
My teammates, it was an honor
to be on the court with you.

351
00:19:44,978 --> 00:19:47,003
You guys are the best.

352
00:19:48,582 --> 00:19:52,143
Even you, Vakidis.
Goddamn dumb son of a bitch.

353
00:19:52,853 --> 00:19:55,480
You don't understand
a word I'm saying, do you?

354
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:59,518
To the Tropic Ball Girls...

355
00:19:59,558 --> 00:20:01,220
I always thought I was gonna sleep
with a couple of you...

356
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,855
but that didn't happen.

357
00:20:06,232 --> 00:20:08,497
That'll teach me to procrastinate.

358
00:20:09,635 --> 00:20:13,094
Bobby Dee,
you're like a son I never had.

359
00:20:14,074 --> 00:20:18,203
The son who's exactly
the same age as me.

360
00:20:18,245 --> 00:20:21,645
Well, kinda... You're like
a half-son, half-friend.

361
00:20:21,681 --> 00:20:24,047
Friend. A son-friend.

362
00:20:24,084 --> 00:20:29,249
No, don't talk. You'll just make it worse.
I don't want to cry and wet my pants.

363
00:20:31,857 --> 00:20:35,884
I'm not makin'
a whole lot of sense right now.

364
00:20:37,764 --> 00:20:38,855
- Jackie?
- Yeah?

365
00:20:38,899 --> 00:20:41,527
- Can I say a couple words?
- Please.

366
00:20:41,567 --> 00:20:43,558
Thanks.

367
00:20:47,274 --> 00:20:51,107
So we all know
that Clarence got traded...

368
00:20:51,144 --> 00:20:55,103
and we all know this game
doesn't really matter anymore, right?

369
00:20:55,148 --> 00:20:57,048
I've been thinking...

370
00:20:58,418 --> 00:21:02,217
We made it our mission
to win fourth place.

371
00:21:03,221 --> 00:21:07,885
You know, fourth place is still out there
waiting for us to take it.

372
00:21:09,361 --> 00:21:11,192
And we're this close.

373
00:21:11,963 --> 00:21:17,197
Now I tried to pretend that
it didn't matter if we won fourth or not.

374
00:21:18,237 --> 00:21:20,228
The truth is...

375
00:21:23,843 --> 00:21:28,711
I never wanted anything
more in my whole fucked-up life.

376
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:31,644
This game does matter.

377
00:21:31,683 --> 00:21:32,673
It matters...

378
00:21:32,718 --> 00:21:38,280
because this is the last real game of
basketball any of us is ever gonna play.

379
00:21:38,324 --> 00:21:40,019
Ever.

380
00:21:41,227 --> 00:21:45,561
Saturday night, I say we leave it
all out there on the floor...

381
00:21:45,597 --> 00:21:48,863
because there is nothing else
for us to save it for.

382
00:21:50,503 --> 00:21:55,030
Clarence or no Clarence,
NBA or no NBA...

383
00:21:57,610 --> 00:21:59,407
this is for us.

384
00:22:05,484 --> 00:22:07,475
Yeah. Let's do this.

385
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:11,020
Jackie Moon, I believe you have
one more game to promote.

386
00:22:11,056 --> 00:22:13,490
- That's right.
- Damn right.

387
00:22:13,526 --> 00:22:16,120
- Gentlemen?
- Let's bring it in.

388
00:22:16,161 --> 00:22:17,719
- Ladies?
- C'mon.

389
00:22:17,763 --> 00:22:20,926
- Yeah.
- Let's go, Tropics.

390
00:22:20,966 --> 00:22:23,662
- Let me hear you say, "Fourth place!"
- Fourth place!

391
00:22:24,003 --> 00:22:25,630
- Fourth place!
- Fourth place!

392
00:22:25,971 --> 00:22:27,563
- Fourth place!
- Fourth place!

393
00:22:27,907 --> 00:22:29,841
- Fourth place!
- Fourth place!

394
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:32,866
Look, the Spurs may be
the number-one team in the league...

395
00:22:32,912 --> 00:22:36,347
but come Saturday night
they're gonna have to prove it.

396
00:22:36,382 --> 00:22:37,848
Turtleneck.

397
00:22:37,883 --> 00:22:41,717
Mr. Moon, since this game
doesn't actually count...

398
00:22:41,754 --> 00:22:43,414
what exactly is your motivation?

399
00:22:43,455 --> 00:22:48,688
On Saturday, we're gonna be playing
for the Flint, Michigan Megabowl.

400
00:22:48,727 --> 00:22:50,250
White pants.

401
00:22:50,296 --> 00:22:52,628
Yeah, I don't know if I understand
what you mean by Megabowl?

402
00:22:52,664 --> 00:22:54,860
It's a Megabowl.
What's not to understand?

403
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,958
This is history in the making.

404
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,836
You're gonna wanna tell your grandkids
and their grandkids and their grandkids.

405
00:23:00,873 --> 00:23:03,467
And when they look back
in the annals of history...

406
00:23:03,509 --> 00:23:05,442
they're gonna be talkin'
about three things...

407
00:23:05,477 --> 00:23:08,969
discovery of fire,
invention of the submarine...

408
00:23:09,014 --> 00:23:10,504
and the Flint, Michigan Megabowl.

409
00:23:10,548 --> 00:23:12,346
Right, but still the game doesn't count.

410
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:17,083
The trophy's 12 feet high.
And it is glorious. I've seen it.

411
00:23:17,122 --> 00:23:19,249
Yeah, and when
we win the game...

412
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:21,054
that big gun's gonna shoot off.

413
00:23:21,093 --> 00:23:23,721
The cannon doesn't actually fire.
It's a relic.

414
00:23:23,761 --> 00:23:25,286
We're gonna win the Megabowl.

415
00:23:25,331 --> 00:23:27,992
Saturday! Eight o'clock!

416
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:29,693
Flint, Michigan Megabowl!

417
00:23:30,035 --> 00:23:33,937
Flint, Michigan Megabowl!
Flint, Michigan Megabowl!

418
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,828
Fourth place! Fourth place!

419
00:23:35,874 --> 00:23:39,469
The Tropics seem to have captured
every heart in this town of underdogs.

420
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:41,444
People have poured in
from around the state...

421
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:45,040
to root for this first Megabowl
championship.

422
00:23:45,084 --> 00:23:47,018
- Fourth place! Fourth place!
- It's a wonderful night for Flint...

423
00:23:47,052 --> 00:23:49,747
and a wonderful night
for the Flint Fairgrounds Coliseum.

424
00:23:50,989 --> 00:23:54,322
Now, Flint will be playing
without Coffee Black, their top scorer...

425
00:23:54,359 --> 00:24:00,264
as the Spurs have traded for several
new players from around the ABA.

426
00:24:00,664 --> 00:24:04,795
I was excited to be here
till I saw your face, Coffee.

427
00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:19,977
Why's it so quiet in here?
Somebody say somethin'!

428
00:24:21,451 --> 00:24:23,578
Monix, what time is it?

429
00:24:24,956 --> 00:24:25,944
It's time.

430
00:24:37,235 --> 00:24:42,332
It is a sold-out crowd here
at the Flint Fairgrounds Coliseum...

431
00:24:42,373 --> 00:24:45,171
as the Tropics walk onto the court.

432
00:24:45,209 --> 00:24:47,939
I tell you what, Dick,
this makes a lot of sense...

433
00:24:47,979 --> 00:24:51,346
this heroes' welcome
for this Flint Tropics team.

434
00:24:51,382 --> 00:24:53,543
This is extraordinary.

435
00:24:53,584 --> 00:24:55,882
Jackie Moon is Flint's favorite son...

436
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,615
and he has done more for this city...

437
00:24:58,655 --> 00:25:01,989
than any human being
who's ever lived on this planet.

438
00:25:02,026 --> 00:25:06,622
With the possible exception
of Henry Ford...

439
00:25:06,663 --> 00:25:09,997
Jackie Moon has done a lot for this city,
you're right about that.

440
00:25:21,913 --> 00:25:24,746
Good tip to the Spurs.
Behind the back.

441
00:25:24,782 --> 00:25:27,114
And wow! A little "How do you do?"
from Markie.

442
00:25:27,151 --> 00:25:29,414
That's a pretty impressive start
for the Spurs.

443
00:25:29,453 --> 00:25:32,287
Running roughshod over the Tropics.

444
00:25:35,426 --> 00:25:37,485
Vakidis passes to Doubleday.

445
00:25:37,528 --> 00:25:39,086
Rejected.

446
00:25:40,064 --> 00:25:41,793
Scootsie passes to Jackie.

447
00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:43,596
Out to Twiggy, and...

448
00:25:43,634 --> 00:25:45,625
Stolen by Rebenkoff.

449
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:46,761
He pulls up for a dagger...

450
00:25:46,804 --> 00:25:48,703
and ouch, three points.

451
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,537
Yeah!

452
00:25:50,575 --> 00:25:55,103
Yeah, I don't feel good about this.
I may not have brought enough Scotch.

453
00:25:55,913 --> 00:25:57,813
Shit!

454
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:02,577
It's hard to say where the Tropics
are falling down worse tonight...

455
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,417
on defense or on offense.

456
00:26:04,455 --> 00:26:07,891
And with Coffee Black on
the Spurs bench, the Tropics look lost.

457
00:26:07,924 --> 00:26:09,789
You're goin' in, Coffee Black.

458
00:26:09,826 --> 00:26:12,693
Coach, I've got back spasms.
I can't do it.

459
00:26:13,463 --> 00:26:15,728
Lutz, you're in.

460
00:26:19,269 --> 00:26:20,634
Jackie! C'mon. Jackie, Jackie!

461
00:26:20,671 --> 00:26:22,332
Moon to Ellis.

462
00:26:22,373 --> 00:26:23,567
Ellis to Munson.

463
00:26:23,607 --> 00:26:25,872
Munson to Monix.

464
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:28,605
Three points! Monix responds!

465
00:26:28,645 --> 00:26:33,742
But it will take more than one fancy
three to defeat these mighty Spurs.

466
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:38,676
This is easily the worst half
of basketball the Tropics have played...

467
00:26:38,721 --> 00:26:40,485
since Monix took over as coach.

468
00:26:40,524 --> 00:26:44,187
- Yeah, it's a shit-fuckin'-sandwich, Dick.
- Let's watch the F-bomb, Lou.

469
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:45,750
With time expiring in the first half...

470
00:26:45,796 --> 00:26:48,697
Monix splits the screen
with a pass to Moon.

471
00:26:48,731 --> 00:26:50,632
He goes up strong...

472
00:26:50,667 --> 00:26:51,655
Gets taken out by Petrelli.

473
00:26:51,701 --> 00:26:55,000
I don't think I've ever seen anyone
get taken out quite that hard before.

474
00:26:55,038 --> 00:26:57,836
- This looks serious.
- Damn.

475
00:26:57,874 --> 00:26:59,535
Monix, you gotta hit him in the nuts!

476
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:02,942
Father Pat breaking up what
could have been total pandemonium.

477
00:27:02,979 --> 00:27:05,913
Come on. Jackie? Jackie.

478
00:27:05,949 --> 00:27:08,816
- Come on, back to the bench.
- Jackie?

479
00:27:08,852 --> 00:27:10,410
He's got a pulse.

480
00:27:11,388 --> 00:27:13,379
Let's get the stretcher.

481
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:16,256
- We don't have a stretcher.
- Jackie sold it.

482
00:27:16,293 --> 00:27:17,953
- All right, well, let's get him up.
- Yeah, come on.

483
00:27:17,994 --> 00:27:19,393
Let's get him in the locker room,
guys. Hurry.

484
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:20,623
Come on, come on.

485
00:27:20,663 --> 00:27:24,498
Jackie's teammates doing just
an awful job of stabilizing his spine...

486
00:27:24,534 --> 00:27:26,399
as they carry him off the court.

487
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:28,596
Come on, Jackie.

488
00:27:51,161 --> 00:27:52,150
Yeah!

489
00:27:52,194 --> 00:27:53,719
Where the hell
do you think you're goin'?

490
00:27:53,763 --> 00:27:54,751
- Coffee!

491
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:57,288
You walk away from this team,
you will never play in the NBA.

492
00:27:57,334 --> 00:27:59,302
That's my son! That's my son!

493
00:27:59,336 --> 00:28:01,930
- Go, Clarence! Go, Clarence!
- You hear me, Coffee?

494
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:05,338
Look at this. Coffee Black
is walking over to the Tropics.

495
00:28:05,375 --> 00:28:08,173
This crowd is going crazy!

496
00:28:12,481 --> 00:28:14,643
Come on, Jackie, wake up.

497
00:28:14,683 --> 00:28:16,879
Jackie, come on,
it's me, it's Bobby Dee.

498
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,979
Wake up. Come on, open 'em up.

499
00:28:19,021 --> 00:28:22,014
- Hey, you got any smelling salt?
- I think we do.

500
00:28:23,026 --> 00:28:24,687
- Get up.
- Jackie.

501
00:28:24,728 --> 00:28:26,558
- Come on, Jackie.
- Snap out of it. Hey.

502
00:28:26,596 --> 00:28:28,928
Come on, baby.

503
00:28:28,965 --> 00:28:30,125
Jackie.

504
00:28:33,636 --> 00:28:34,968
Mom.

505
00:28:37,307 --> 00:28:40,105
- I miss you, Mama.
- I miss you too, honey.

506
00:28:40,143 --> 00:28:43,977
- Come on, little fella. Jackie.
- Jackie.

507
00:28:44,014 --> 00:28:46,005
Clarence, what are you doin' here?

508
00:28:46,048 --> 00:28:49,711
What it look like?
I'm wit' y'all. He a'ight?

509
00:28:49,753 --> 00:28:52,984
Are you outta your mind?
You wanna lose your NBA contract?

510
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:57,482
I don't care nothin' about that, man. This
is our season and we gonna finish it.

511
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:59,289
So you're gonna blow the deal for this?

512
00:28:59,328 --> 00:29:02,093
- Fourth place, right?
- Right.

513
00:29:02,132 --> 00:29:04,225
- Let's get Tropical.
- Right on.

514
00:29:04,267 --> 00:29:06,428
Come on, buddy. Come around.

515
00:29:07,437 --> 00:29:09,200
Now, I want you to go forward...

516
00:29:09,239 --> 00:29:12,538
and tell the others
what I have told you here today.

517
00:29:12,575 --> 00:29:14,304
Do you understand me, son?

518
00:29:14,344 --> 00:29:16,710
Yes, Mama. You're so kind.

519
00:29:17,713 --> 00:29:19,409
I'm sorry I stole your song.

520
00:29:19,449 --> 00:29:22,350
I forgave you for that a long time ago.

521
00:29:22,384 --> 00:29:25,649
Jackie, it's time you forgave yourself.

522
00:29:26,721 --> 00:29:29,816
I don't wanna leave this place.
It's so fluffy.

523
00:29:29,857 --> 00:29:33,692
Now hurry up,
and don't forget what I said.

524
00:29:33,729 --> 00:29:35,855
OK. Bye!

525
00:29:36,999 --> 00:29:39,297
Bye, Mama. Bye.

526
00:29:39,335 --> 00:29:41,165
Bye.

527
00:29:41,202 --> 00:29:43,899
Hey... I threw up, Mom.

528
00:29:43,939 --> 00:29:46,533
I know you did, sweetie.

529
00:29:46,575 --> 00:29:48,838
I threw up all by myself.

530
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,047
- That's workin'.
- Here we go. Come on, Jackie.

531
00:29:53,082 --> 00:29:55,141
A little eye flutter. Hello, fella!

532
00:29:55,183 --> 00:29:56,811
- Hey there!
- Mornin', sunshine.

533
00:29:56,852 --> 00:29:58,046
We missed ya.

534
00:29:58,086 --> 00:29:59,816
This just in.

535
00:29:59,855 --> 00:30:03,018
It sounds like Jackie Moon is up
and around the Tropics locker room.

536
00:30:03,057 --> 00:30:07,552
Then fake the pass and go straight
to the basket. Twiggy, how hard is it?

537
00:30:07,596 --> 00:30:09,722
He keeps throwin' elbows.
What do you want me to do?

538
00:30:09,765 --> 00:30:12,199
I want you to stand up to him,
ya pussy.

539
00:30:12,234 --> 00:30:15,601
Monix, wait. I gotta tell
these guys somethin'.

540
00:30:16,538 --> 00:30:18,699
I had a dream.

541
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:21,335
I had a dream I was in heaven.

542
00:30:21,376 --> 00:30:23,971
And my mother spoke to me.

543
00:30:24,013 --> 00:30:25,741
She was wearing
this flowing white gown...

544
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:29,615
and she showed me
a brand-new way to score a basket.

545
00:30:29,651 --> 00:30:32,484
She called it the alley oop.

546
00:30:33,455 --> 00:30:39,690
She spoke to me and she said,
"With this gift, you will win fourth place."

547
00:30:46,735 --> 00:30:49,328
We are back in action here
at the Megabowl.

548
00:30:49,371 --> 00:30:52,670
Coffee Black is playing for the Tropics.

549
00:30:52,708 --> 00:30:54,141
Jackie makes the start here.

550
00:30:54,176 --> 00:30:57,873
In fact, it looks like
he's running the offense.

551
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,017
What was that?

552
00:31:40,055 --> 00:31:42,489
I'm sorry, I don't know
what just happened.

553
00:31:42,524 --> 00:31:47,153
A very unusual series of moves
just made the ball go in.

554
00:31:49,832 --> 00:31:51,355
Damn.

555
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:55,028
Yeah, I don't know why, Dick,
but I just got an erection.

556
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:02,507
Foul. No, two fouls.

557
00:32:02,544 --> 00:32:05,569
Foul?! I didn't touch anybody.

558
00:32:05,614 --> 00:32:07,639
Look, Jackie, people can't just
go flyin' in the air like that.

559
00:32:07,682 --> 00:32:10,083
Please. My mom
wouldn't cheat in my dreams.

560
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:12,417
- What?
- She's an angel!

561
00:32:12,453 --> 00:32:14,421
Heaven wants us to win this game!

562
00:32:14,455 --> 00:32:16,889
- I'll burn your house down!
- Hold it, hold it, hold it.

563
00:32:16,923 --> 00:32:19,757
It can't be a foul without
touchin' another player.

564
00:32:19,794 --> 00:32:23,230
And it can't be traveling without
first establishing a pivot foot.

565
00:32:23,264 --> 00:32:25,163
- That's right.
- It's two points, Father Pat.

566
00:32:25,199 --> 00:32:26,564
It is two points.

567
00:32:30,337 --> 00:32:33,636
- All right, I'm gonna allow it.
- That's the gospel.

568
00:32:33,673 --> 00:32:35,869
Two points, Flint.

569
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:37,275
Are you outta your mind?

570
00:32:37,311 --> 00:32:39,403
- He was floating. Is this ghost ball?
- It's legal, Coach.

571
00:32:39,447 --> 00:32:40,937
- It's legal, Coach.
- What the hell is that?

572
00:32:40,981 --> 00:32:42,846
Yeah!

573
00:32:42,884 --> 00:32:45,216
It worked, Jackie!

574
00:32:45,253 --> 00:32:46,913
Thanks, Mama!

575
00:32:48,155 --> 00:32:50,646
Things are getting interesting
here in the second half.

576
00:32:50,691 --> 00:32:53,750
It's the Spurs' ball
as Rebenkoff makes a shot.

577
00:32:53,794 --> 00:32:55,192
Misses it.

578
00:32:55,229 --> 00:32:57,129
Rebound Tropics.

579
00:32:59,634 --> 00:33:00,623
There it is again.

580
00:33:00,668 --> 00:33:04,104
Clarence leaping and forcing the ball in
a downward direction through the net...

581
00:33:04,138 --> 00:33:06,230
off of a high arching pass.

582
00:33:06,274 --> 00:33:07,571
- It's a great play.
- It sure is.

583
00:33:07,607 --> 00:33:12,341
Hold on. I'm just being told
that this is called an alley oop!

584
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:13,938
Yes, that is easier to say.

585
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:15,607
Twig!

586
00:33:16,616 --> 00:33:18,141
Monix passes to Jackie.

587
00:33:18,186 --> 00:33:19,312
Jackie lobs to Clarence.

588
00:33:19,353 --> 00:33:21,253
And then, yes! Another alley oop.

589
00:33:21,288 --> 00:33:23,052
The Spurs don't know what's hit 'em.

590
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:25,354
I love the alley oop.

591
00:33:28,996 --> 00:33:30,223
Yes! Yeah!

592
00:33:31,699 --> 00:33:34,223
# I wanna take you higher #

593
00:33:36,504 --> 00:33:38,734
# I wanna take you higher #

594
00:33:38,773 --> 00:33:39,797
Here comes the alley.

595
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,967
And there goes the oop!

596
00:33:51,852 --> 00:33:53,375
Timeout, white.

597
00:33:53,421 --> 00:33:56,652
In all my years of radio,
I've never seen anything like this.

598
00:33:56,691 --> 00:33:59,818
The Tropics have fought their way back
from a huge deficit...

599
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:03,455
and now with 12 seconds left
in the history of this franchise...

600
00:34:03,497 --> 00:34:07,365
they are down by two,
and, man, you can feel the tension.

601
00:34:07,401 --> 00:34:09,698
OK, guys, listen up.
They've made adjustments.

602
00:34:09,736 --> 00:34:12,500
We can't keep runnin' the alley oop.
They're keying on Clarence.

603
00:34:12,539 --> 00:34:14,769
So we're not gonna run the alley oop.

604
00:34:14,808 --> 00:34:17,436
- What the hell we gonna run, then?
- The puke.

605
00:34:17,477 --> 00:34:18,672
The puke?

606
00:34:18,712 --> 00:34:21,806
Don't tell me you've forgotten it.
I seared it into your brains.

607
00:34:21,848 --> 00:34:25,443
- This will work, OK? The puke.
- Right on.

608
00:34:25,485 --> 00:34:27,419
I was gonna say exactly the same thing.

609
00:34:27,454 --> 00:34:30,514
Good call. "Let's get Tropical" on three.
One, two, three.

610
00:34:30,557 --> 00:34:32,684
Let's get Tropical!

611
00:34:32,726 --> 00:34:34,216
We're down to the last play.

612
00:34:34,261 --> 00:34:35,626
Monix inbounds to Jackie.

613
00:34:35,663 --> 00:34:37,653
Jackie passes right back to Monix.

614
00:34:37,697 --> 00:34:39,494
Monix back to Jackie.

615
00:34:39,532 --> 00:34:42,057
The Tropics have gotta
make a move here, Dick.

616
00:34:42,102 --> 00:34:44,502
Yeah, they need to find a way
to the hole and fast.

617
00:34:44,538 --> 00:34:47,802
Monix finds Bee Bee.
Back door to Jackie. He goes up strong...

618
00:34:47,841 --> 00:34:50,935
- Fouled hard by Petrelli!
- Eat shit, Petrelli!

619
00:34:50,977 --> 00:34:52,638
Don't you know
how to play basketball?

620
00:34:54,381 --> 00:34:56,542
Father Pat struggles to keep order...

621
00:34:56,583 --> 00:34:59,074
between these two tough,
competitive teams.

622
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:03,077
All right. Black. Four-two.
With the body. Two shots.

623
00:35:03,122 --> 00:35:06,285
- Come on, Jackie!
- Jackie will shoot two free throws here.

624
00:35:06,326 --> 00:35:09,761
His team down by two,
with two seconds left on the clock.

625
00:35:09,795 --> 00:35:13,561
All right, gentlemen.
Relax on the first one, we got two here.

626
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:15,829
Come on, Jackie.

627
00:35:15,868 --> 00:35:19,599
Don't worry, guys. I got these.
I'm very good at free throws.

628
00:35:19,638 --> 00:35:23,904
Seriously, free throws are probably
the best facet of my game.

629
00:35:26,879 --> 00:35:29,609
What the hell are you doin', Jackie?

630
00:35:29,648 --> 00:35:32,173
What, you never see me
shoot free throws before?

631
00:35:32,217 --> 00:35:34,685
He's shootin' granny style.
Let 'im do his thing.

632
00:35:34,721 --> 00:35:36,210
Always has.

633
00:35:36,255 --> 00:35:38,246
Shit.

634
00:35:39,259 --> 00:35:40,782
Here we go.

635
00:35:42,394 --> 00:35:46,558
Jackie Moon holding the fate of Flint
in his fingertips.

636
00:35:46,598 --> 00:35:49,362
- He kisses the ball for good luck.
- Sweet sugar.

637
00:35:53,172 --> 00:35:55,140
It's good!

638
00:35:55,174 --> 00:35:58,473
- Yes!
- Never doubted you, Jackie. Come on.

639
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:00,705
The Tropics need one more
to stay alive.

640
00:36:00,746 --> 00:36:04,512
Watch the lines. Move on the release.

641
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:06,518
One more, Jackie.

642
00:37:24,931 --> 00:37:28,024
Flint wins the Megabowl!
Flint wins the Megabowl!

643
00:37:28,367 --> 00:37:31,268
Flint wins the Megabowl!

644
00:37:32,004 --> 00:37:34,632
- Fourth place! Fourth place!

645
00:37:34,673 --> 00:37:36,538
Go Tropics! Go Tropics! Go Tropics!

646
00:37:36,576 --> 00:37:38,839
# And keep on wishin' #

647
00:37:39,846 --> 00:37:43,246
# Remember your dreams
are your only schemes #

648
00:37:43,282 --> 00:37:45,547
# So keep on pushin' #

649
00:37:47,619 --> 00:37:50,416
Who's number four?
Who's number four?

650
00:37:50,455 --> 00:37:53,583
- Yeah, Scoots!
- God. We really did it.

651
00:37:53,625 --> 00:37:57,152
Just a moment.
Just a moment, please. Don't...

652
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:02,690
- What are you doin'?
- # Just move on up #

653
00:38:02,733 --> 00:38:05,725

- Fourth place! Fourth place!

656
00:38:11,442 --> 00:38:13,307
# Where there's only one kind #

657
00:38:17,582 --> 00:38:18,879
Yeah!

658
00:38:18,916 --> 00:38:19,905
- Hey, Coffee.
- What?

659
00:38:19,951 --> 00:38:24,911
I've changed my mind. I think we could
use that alley oop of yours in the NBA.

660
00:38:25,923 --> 00:38:28,391
Thanks, Coach! Mama!

661
00:38:28,426 --> 00:38:31,088
The NBA!

662
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:33,288
- Hey!
- Yeah, baby!

663
00:38:33,331 --> 00:38:35,925
- Way to go!
- Thank you.

664
00:38:35,967 --> 00:38:39,130
# Move on up #

665
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:40,899
# And keep on wishin' #

666
00:38:40,938 --> 00:38:44,431
- Yes!
- Yeah!

667
00:38:44,475 --> 00:38:47,638
- We did it! Yeah!
- Yeah!

668
00:38:47,678 --> 00:38:48,667
- Jackie!
- Hey!

669
00:38:48,713 --> 00:38:51,341
- Congratulations on the Megabowl!
- Thank you.

670
00:38:51,382 --> 00:38:53,179
- Whatever that is.
- It's very exciting!

671
00:38:53,217 --> 00:38:55,117
- Yeah.
- You're a hell of a promoter!

672
00:38:55,152 --> 00:38:56,176
Yeah.

673
00:38:56,221 --> 00:38:59,189
Listen, I'm gonna be working
with the Commissioner of the NBA...

674
00:38:59,223 --> 00:39:01,192
and I want you to join me.

675
00:39:01,225 --> 00:39:04,422
Me in the NBA?! Really?

676
00:39:04,462 --> 00:39:07,795
My God, thank you.
Can I bring my son-friend with me?

677
00:39:07,832 --> 00:39:10,164
- Jackie, you don't have to do that.
- Yes, I do.

678
00:39:10,201 --> 00:39:12,635
Mark my words,
as long as I'm alive, you'll both...

679
00:39:14,806 --> 00:39:17,740
Everybody panic!

680
00:39:17,775 --> 00:39:21,143
It's just like the Titanic,
but it's full of bears!

681
00:39:24,382 --> 00:39:26,145
# Yeah #

682
00:39:26,183 --> 00:39:28,083
# Hey #

683
00:39:30,054 --> 00:39:32,250

684
00:39:34,625 --> 00:39:36,991
# Your dream
will take you very far, yeah #

685
00:39:37,028 --> 00:39:41,590
"Dear Dukes. I'm sorry it took so long,
but in this bag is 10,000 dollars, cash."

686
00:39:41,632 --> 00:39:44,533
No way. Really?

687
00:39:44,569 --> 00:39:46,594
Actually, it's only 2,300.

688
00:39:46,637 --> 00:39:49,971
I'll be payin' you the rest
right after they finish my merger buyout.

689
00:39:50,007 --> 00:39:53,465
Let's get Tropical. Jackie R. Moon.
