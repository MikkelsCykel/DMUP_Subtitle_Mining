1
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,210
It stopped.

2
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:13,280
What's that, Dave?

3
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:14,240
Nothing.

4
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,250
How we doing?

5
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:16,440
Oh, we're ready.

6
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:18,590
You feeling the magic?

7
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,380
Oh, I'm feeling the magic,
all right.

8
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:21,430
Let's hit 'em.

9
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:22,520
Yeah.

10
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,640
Let's do it.

11
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:24,610
Here we go.

12
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:25,890
Let's hit 'em.

13
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,370
Let's go make $30 million.

14
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:34,230
Good morning.

15
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:37,240
Before I begin, let me...

16
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,630
David?

17
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,420
I'll go get help.

18
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:49,950
Jesus. Jesus, David.

19
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,960
Phone 9-1-1. Phone 9-1-1!

20
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,180
David?

21
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,660
Nick?

22
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,660
Vicky?!

23
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,360
Vicky!

24
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,310
Okay, it's okay.

25
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:30,760
It's okay.

26
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:33,470
Everybody else off the bus.

27
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,140
Sound waves.

28
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:46,780
So, if we know that sound waves

29
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:51,860
gain wavelength
and lose frequency

30
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:55,070
as they travel
through more dense materials...

31
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,000
...then the anomalies
in these waves

32
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:03,000
are the means by which
we can surmise

33
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:05,410
the fundamental architecture
of our planet.

34
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,020
How are the nails coming,
Christine?

35
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,130
Good.

36
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:16,100
All right,
let's have a demonstration.

37
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,500
Mr. Acker, Veronica.

38
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,800
Thank you very much.

39
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:23,350
All right.

40
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,630
Mrs. Limestone,
being a big softie, you know,

41
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,730
loves walks in the park,
bedtime stories,

42
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:28,700
big romantic.

43
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:29,720
Loves Chet.

44
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:31,840
I can't play Chet,
but I'll see what I can do.

45
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,070
Watch the oscilloscope,
all right?

46
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:36,150
Here we go.

47
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:45,400
Dr. Joshua Keyes?

48
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,780
Maybe.

49
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,370
Yes or no, sir?

50
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:50,310
The first one.

51
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,860
Please come with us, sir.

52
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,430
Guys, wh-what's going on?

53
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,910
We don't know, sir.

54
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,910
What do you mean,
you don't know?

55
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:03,640
Your security clearance
is higher than ours.

56
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,310
I have security clearance?

57
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,370
We're just here to
bring you to your jet.

58
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:09,430
I have a jet?

59
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,330
Hey, Serge.

60
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,570
Ah!

61
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:28,540
Serge.

62
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:29,530
Serge.

63
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,640
Damn!

64
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,690
It's about time.
You're always late.

65
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,150
Let's keep moving, gentlemen.

66
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,270
What am I doing here?

67
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,450
They wouldn't brief me
until you got here.

68
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:42,200
You know, there are biochemists
everywhere, military.

69
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,480
I hate them.

70
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,110
When are you going to meet
a nice girl

71
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,200
and bring her for dinner?

72
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,210
I'm married to my work.

73
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,360
So am I.

74
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,870
Which makes my wife
my mistress...

75
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,660
that's why I'm still
in love with her.

76
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,230
You were always a romantic.

77
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:56,340
I love my wife.

78
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:57,940
Yeah, I know.
I love your wife, too.

79
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:59,220
I know.

80
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,210
But I don't love your wife.
You know what I mean.

81
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,930
You don't love her
the same way, you know.

82
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:05,310
It's the French.
I think it's the cheese.

83
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:06,590
Ah, the cheese.

84
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,340
You're...
you're teasing me, right?

85
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:09,790
Oh, my...!

86
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,540
Whoa. Wait, these are bodies.

87
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:13,270
I think we're
in the wrong place here.

88
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,680
Yeah, we're in the wrong place.

89
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,610
No. If you were
in the wrong place,

90
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:18,420
you would've already been shot.

91
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,530
That's a hell of a greeting.

92
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:21,950
Serge.

93
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,190
Serge.

94
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,500
Serge. Yes.
Always a pleasure.

95
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:25,620
Same here, Thomas.

96
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:26,740
Dr. Keyes.

97
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:29,140
- I know.
- Tom Purcell.

98
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:31,700
Gentlemen, you do realize
that everything here

99
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:34,430
is totally classified, okay?

100
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:38,260
At 10:30 a.m. Local time,

101
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,970
32 civilians,
all within a 10-block radius...

102
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,020
died.

103
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:45,750
They didn't get sick first.

104
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,800
They simply hit the ground dead.

105
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:48,760
Nerve agent?

106
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:49,720
Our first guess. No.

107
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:51,570
They all died
at the same time?

108
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,820
As far as we can tell,
to the second.

109
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,160
This hits CNN in one hour.

110
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,440
I need a reason.

111
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,870
Is there a variation
in sex, age, body type?

112
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,500
They all had pacemakers.

113
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,190
Under a minute.

114
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,540
Your reputation is
well deserved.

115
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:08,380
- Hey, hey, hey.
- How did you guess?

116
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,790
Without any clues
from the victims?

117
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:10,740
No, that's...

118
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:11,920
Serge and I are the clues.

119
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:14,030
I mean, he specializes
in high energy weapons.

120
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:15,000
I do geomagnetics.

121
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,470
So calling us means you suspect

122
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,920
an electromagnetic
pulse weapon.

123
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,690
If these are
the only fatalities,

124
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:22,670
they must be people
susceptible to...

125
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,030
electronic interference.

126
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:25,070
QED pacemakers.

127
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,770
You're spooky sometimes, eh?

128
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:28,020
Now I need to know,

129
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:30,330
did some sort of weapon
kill these people?

130
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,410
The power that you would need

131
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,890
to create an EM pulse
strong enough...

132
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,550
I mean, that's...
that's not a weapon that

133
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:35,670
- I've ever heard of.
- No.

134
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,910
Okay, we're done.

135
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,830
We're not done, sir.

136
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,320
There's nothing on the other
side of the equal sign.

137
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:43,410
I agree with Joshua...

138
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:44,720
Thank you.

139
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:47,030
Our greatest concern was this
may have been an act of war,

140
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,310
but since it's not,

141
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:51,060
I think we can all breathe
a little easier, can't we?

142
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:09,370
Look at my hat.

143
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,750
What is it, sweetheart?

144
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:25,810
It's okay, son.

145
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,500
These things happen
all the time and...

146
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:38,420
Let's, go, let's go!
Come on!

147
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,310
Justin!

148
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,790
Watch out, you bloody idiot!

149
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,570
Hurry! Run!

150
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:48,850
Daddy!

151
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:02,250
The skies are empty
over Nelson's Column now,

152
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,590
but a few hours ago,
it was a different story.

153
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,450
Eyewitnesses claimed that
the frenzied swarms of birds

154
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,100
were not in fact attacking
people deliberately...

155
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,000
And it's not just this time.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

156
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,530
But seemed to be confused
and flying blind.

157
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,190
The FOrtean Times reported
violent bird swarms

158
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,670
twice last month in
Australia and Japan.

159
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,620
Five people are confirmed dead
and dozens injured

160
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,110
in the panic that followed the
bizarre and terrifying incident

161
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,650
in London's historic
Trafalgar Square.

162
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,800
- Weird.
- Mm-hmm.

163
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,110
Quite strange, also.

164
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,130
Mm. Strange, indeed.

165
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,520
Mm!

166
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,570
How do birds navigate?

167
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,710
By sight?

168
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,350
No, no, no,
the long range stuff.

169
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,350
Magnetic fields.

170
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,690
Little ions in their brains

171
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,790
align with the magnetic field
of the Earth.

172
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:42,130
- Yeah, what she said.
- Right?

173
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,240
Acker.

174
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,170
Hit the 'Net, do a search for...

175
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,930
oh, two years ought to do it.

176
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:48,810
Any and all, like, "weird news",
you know...

177
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,030
bizarre animal migrations,

178
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,440
specifically birds.

179
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,810
Whale and dolphin beachings.

180
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,860
Unusual atmospheric phenomenon,
unexplained plane crashes,

181
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:56,940
you know,
just use your imagination.

182
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:58,440
That is a huge search.

183
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,550
You can use our T-1 line
to look up Sailor Moon crap.

184
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:01,910
You're up to this.

185
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:03,380
Danni, Danni,
get me the brightest kids

186
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:04,620
from the Field Theory Class,

187
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,770
and design a computer model
of an electromagnetic field.

188
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:07,880
What are we doing?

189
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,480
I need a 3-D computer model
of the Earth

190
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,450
to lay the field over.

191
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,560
Whoa-ho-ho, the planet Earth?

192
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,120
Yeah, the planet Earth.
You know, the pretty blue one.

193
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,980
Map out the anomalies
that Acker finds

194
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,520
and grunt out the equations.

195
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,530
And, uh...

196
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:20,200
grab those smelly kids

197
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,620
from the Non-Linear
Diff class, too.

198
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,210
Listen, Josh, do we even
have time for this?

199
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,550
Do this and I'll sign
your doctorates blindfolded.

200
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,760
- Blindfolded?
- Blindfolded.

201
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,430
Do not pass Go.
Go directly to PhD.

202
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:38,000
Be wrong. Be wrong.

203
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:33,070
Tim, I'm coming in a little hot.

204
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,510
Give me some drag, will you?

205
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:37,230
Roger that.

206
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:47,310
We are in attitude and ready
for an entry interface.

207
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,590
Nice work, Major.

208
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:50,900
I have the controls
now for E.I.

209
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,580
I could take us in.

210
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:54,860
You could...

211
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,980
but you won't.

212
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:57,060
I'm ready for this, Bob.

213
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:58,440
Oh, no, you're not, Beck.

214
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,520
You're trained,
and you're certified...

215
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:02,280
doesn't make you the commander.

216
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,140
And the commander
lands the bird.

217
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:06,380
You got to be the youngest
person ever in space.

218
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:08,110
You should say,
thank you, be happy.

219
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:08,940
Now.

220
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:12,340
EndeavOur, Houston,
at this time

221
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,990
we show you go for reentry.

222
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:16,480
Houston, EndeavOur descending
through 400,000 feet

223
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,840
coming upon entry interface.

224
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,150
EndeavOur, this is Flight.

225
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,780
Weren't able to annoy
the commander

226
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:22,710
into letting you
bring her in this time?

227
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:23,670
That's a negative, Stick.

228
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,900
I'll have to be
more annoying next time.

229
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:25,740
Is that even possible?

230
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,670
EndeavOur,

231
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,350
we see you in
good entry config.

232
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,570
Roger, Houston.

233
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:35,400
Advise.

234
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,960
I'm seeing those
plasma trails now.

235
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:38,920
All right, mark 241/2.

236
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:40,200
So, a minute to air.

237
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:41,900
I don't believe in belts.

238
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:48,660
Just get me through the Earth's
atmosphere in this spaceship.

239
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,730
Com dropout.

240
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,370
Start the I Com.

241
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,930
Let's wait till the...

242
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,690
Com restored.

243
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,710
Quiet!

244
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,750
We are out of position here.

245
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:26,540
Guidance shows us
on energy and on course.

246
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:28,940
Well, I've made this approach
213 times in the simulator.

247
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,390
We're not where we should be.

248
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,530
Where the hell are we?

249
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,250
EndeavOur, guidance is bad.

250
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:37,990
You are now
1-2-niner miles off course.

251
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:39,300
Roger, Houston.
We sort of noticed.

252
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:40,230
Is that...?

253
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,250
Los Angeles. That is confirmed.

254
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,850
We are 1-5 thousand feet.

255
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,600
We got maybe two minutes
of glide time left.

256
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:47,600
Doesn't make sense.

257
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:49,670
The guidance,
the beacons are all wrong?

258
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,980
We're heading straight
for downtown.

259
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:52,970
We're not going to crash
into Los Angeles.

260
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,350
They're going to hit
downtown L.A.

261
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,340
At 300 knots.

262
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,940
Bob, you know L.A.?
Because I have an idea.

263
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:01,980
Houston, those buildings
are getting mighty big.

264
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,470
Can you clear a freeway?

265
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,290
Okay, thank you.

266
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,640
Come on. Come on.

267
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,230
It's rush hour, Commander,

268
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:10,640
and it's bumper-to-bumper.

269
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,540
Sir, I have an alternate.

270
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:15,780
If you turn to heading 1-7-5...

271
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:17,170
It's Houston's call. Houston?

272
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:20,170
Computers are still plotting.

273
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:22,310
Come on.

274
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,350
Houston, we are running

275
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,460
out of time here.

276
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,200
Sir, I have an alternate.

277
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:45,200
All right, Beck,
what do you got?

278
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:46,240
Houston, I have coordinates

279
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,210
for an alternate landing site.

280
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,170
Can you confirm?

281
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,860
EndeavOur, give them to me.

282
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:53,510
I show possible touchdown...
at 33.55 north, 118.10 west.

283
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:56,900
Bill?

284
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:58,530
It's theoretically possible.

285
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,370
EndeavOur,

286
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,390
that is confirmed.

287
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:03,300
Turn right, heading 1-7-5.

288
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:04,350
Expect visual contact

289
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:06,560
with Los Angeles River
in five seconds.

290
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:12,930
No, that will not work, Houston.

291
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,600
We got bridges
every few hundred yards.

292
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:16,330
Our wingspan alone
is going to fold us up.

293
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,740
I've figured the "L"
over "D" max.

294
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,690
We can make it
if you can bring us straight in.

295
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:20,770
We're coming in high and hot.

296
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:28,550
290 feet, 320.

297
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:29,540
- 270, 3-0-5...
- Arm the gear.

298
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:30,690
You're armed.

299
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,390
Gear down. Now.

300
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:33,160
Gear in transition.

301
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,620
240 feet, 290.

302
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,660
Hang on.
This isn't going to be subtle.

303
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:47,720
210 feet, 265.

304
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,540
Get out of the way! Move!

305
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:53,760
Derotate.

306
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:54,920
Inward.

307
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:01,760
230... 210...

308
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:03,150
Speed brakes!

309
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:04,420
100%.

310
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:05,700
Oh, we're way too fast.

311
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:06,820
Deploy the chute.

312
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:09,570
No. We'd snag the bridge.
We'll tear the tail off.

313
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:14,080
Banking right.

314
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,560
Commander, that next bridge!

315
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,570
Watch it!

316
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:22,760
We're way too high
for that one!

317
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:23,720
Suck up the gear!

318
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,800
Not yet.
We'll lose all steering.

319
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,070
We hit, it's over!

320
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,000
And... gear up now!

321
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,620
Lock your harnesses.
This is out of my hands.

322
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:56,740
Let's get out of here!

323
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:59,050
Run! Let's get out!

324
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:41,060
Dr. Zimsky?!

325
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:43,200
Will you make sure
my assistant has

326
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,170
your number, darling?

327
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,130
Sure.

328
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,090
- Dr. Zimsky!
- Hello.

329
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,050
I'll call security.

330
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:49,000
No, it's all right.
It's all right. Hello.

331
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:49,950
Thank you, sir.

332
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,680
- Dr. Zimsky.
- Yes. What's your name?

333
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,610
- Josh Keyes.
- Josh.

334
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,430
No, sir, I don't need you
to sign it.

335
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:55,650
I need you to read that.

336
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,990
I'm sorry, I don't have time.

337
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:59,240
- I'm late for the White House.
- Sir, please.

338
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,960
I need you to confirm
my results, sir.

339
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:03,210
Young man, do you have any idea
who I am?

340
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:05,250
Yes, I do, sir.
Please read this.

341
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:09,410
What's it about?

342
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:13,570
It's the end of the world.

343
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,630
No, I... this is impossible.
I'm sorry.

344
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:41,350
L-l-I can't have missed this.

345
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:42,360
You-You have to be wrong.

346
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,650
I mean, look, I'm sure

347
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:45,820
with careful comparison
to my own work,

348
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:47,100
we'll find that
you are mistaken.

349
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,550
No offense, but...

350
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:50,300
Well, I mean,
we'll know soon enough.

351
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:54,240
The bigger effects will start up
any day now.

352
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:53,830
Rebecca?

353
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,420
Only you and Dad
ever call me that.

354
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,180
Well, Beck.

355
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,620
So, what brings you
to sunny D.C.?

356
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:01,470
The Board of Review
is next week.

357
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:06,560
Just trying to get a sense
of the mood upstairs.

358
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:07,700
How bad is it?

359
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:10,270
Your crew crashed
the space shuttle.

360
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:13,060
Now, how good do you
think it could be?

361
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,440
Sir, this is my life.

362
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,550
Well...

363
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,760
I was studying for the academy
when I was 13.

364
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:19,970
It still is and has always been
my life.

365
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,730
It's over.

366
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:24,830
It's over, Rebecca.

367
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,460
I'm sorry.

368
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:28,090
It's right down here.

369
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,050
Really?

370
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:29,980
It's like the 4th of July.

371
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:31,130
What the hell's the hurry here?

372
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:36,830
Rebecca, would you excuse me,
please?

373
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,490
Excuse me.

374
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,620
Purcell.

375
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:48,130
Thomas, um, look...

376
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:50,680
it seems that destiny
may have caught up with us.

377
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:12,710
Did Zimsky really try
to give you his autograph?

378
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,240
Ah, Monsieur Zimsky.

379
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,370
Conrad Zimsky.

380
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:19,750
Herr Zimsky.

381
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:21,090
Superstar.

382
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,650
Oh...

383
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:30,050
I think I skipped drunk.

384
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:33,140
Went right to hangover.

385
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:36,090
Weren't you the one?

386
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,620
I spoke with the kids.

387
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,930
They don't sleep at night.

388
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,920
They look at the sky, and...
and they think it's pretty.

389
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,840
Is there any chance
you're wrong?

390
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:49,470
No. The sky, man.

391
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:51,100
The sky... I mean,
that's just the beginning.

392
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:52,510
That's high-altitude
static discharge.

393
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:54,400
I know.

394
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,960
Dr. Keyes...

395
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:01,050
...your presence is
required at the Pentagon.

396
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,490
Ah... it's my best buddies.

397
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:04,960
Hey!

398
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,810
Why don't you join
us for a drink?

399
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,340
We'd be grateful if you could
join us for a ride, sir.

400
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,130
And if I were to say no?

401
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,510
- Just asking.
- Yeah.

402
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,650
Well, we have
no sense of humor.

403
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,770
That's true.

404
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,940
Oh...

405
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,910
And we're armed.

406
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,350
Thank you.

407
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:28,700
Dr. Keyes, welcome.

408
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:30,010
Thank you.

409
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:31,220
Dr. Zimsky informs us

410
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,150
that you made a
useful contribution

411
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,120
to his investigations,
so he wanted you

412
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,570
to assist him
in the briefing.

413
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,260
That's very generous of you,
Dr. Zimsky.

414
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,540
Science is a selfless business,
dear boy.

415
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:43,460
Now, why don't you begin,

416
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:46,110
and I'll fill in
all the difficult bits.

417
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,930
All right, I'll put this
as simply as I can.

418
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:55,060
Everybody on Earth
is dead in a year.

419
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:58,580
And let me explain why.

420
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:02,330
Wrapped around the Earth
is an invisible field of energy.

421
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,020
It's made up of...
electricity and magnetism,

422
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,910
so it's called...
creatively enough...

423
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:08,340
the electromagnetic field.

424
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:11,480
It's where we get our magnetic
North Pole and South Pole,

425
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:13,720
and it protects us
from cosmic radiation.

426
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:15,450
So this EM field is our friend.

427
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,340
But now...?

428
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:18,750
But now,

429
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:20,310
that field is falling apart.

430
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,370
Why?

431
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,970
Why?

432
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:26,390
This here.

433
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:30,560
Does somebody have a can
of air freshener?

434
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:36,950
Quick and dirty.

435
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:39,770
The thin skin,
that's the Earth's crust.

436
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,460
That's what we live on.

437
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:42,650
It's 30 miles thick.

438
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,400
The meat here,
call it the mantle.

439
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:49,140
And forgetting
all the-the funky transitions,

440
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,590
it's 2,000 miles thick.

441
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:52,990
The core,

442
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:55,380
the peach pit in the center...
that's a tricky one.

443
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,700
There's two parts...

444
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:58,180
the inner core
and the outer core.

445
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:59,180
Are you following me?

446
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,050
The inner core

447
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,980
is, uh...

448
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:03,960
well, it's a big, solid chunk
of iron,

449
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,080
we think.

450
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:06,460
And that's surrounded

451
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:08,630
by the outer core,
and that is liquid.

452
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:09,940
Yes, but,

453
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:12,860
most importantly, this liquid
is constantly spinning

454
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,940
in one direction.

455
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:17,140
So a trillion trillion tons
of hot metal

456
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:20,470
spinning at
a thousand miles an hour, so...

457
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,560
Right, so Physics 101...

458
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:23,990
hot metal moving fast
makes an electromagnetic field.

459
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:26,550
This spinning liquid outer core
is the engine

460
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:28,410
that drives the EM Field.

461
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,580
And that's where
we have our problem.

462
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,950
This engine has stalled.

463
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:35,840
The core of the Earth
has stopped spinning.

464
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:40,400
How could this have happened?

465
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:42,810
We don't know.

466
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:47,820
What's the timeline here?

467
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:50,320
As the EM Field
becomes more and more unstable,

468
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:52,340
we'll start seeing
isolated incidents.

469
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:53,840
One plane
will fall from the sky,

470
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:55,030
and then two, and then...

471
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,440
in a few months, anything...

472
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:58,300
everything electronic
will be fried.

473
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,770
Static discharges
in the atmosphere

474
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,660
will create "super-storms"
with hundreds

475
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,190
of lightening strikes
per square mile.

476
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:05,140
After that, it gets bad.

477
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:08,690
The Earth's EM Field

478
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,800
shields us from the solar winds,
which are a lethal blend

479
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:15,610
of radioactive particles
and microwaves.

480
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:18,970
When that shield collapses,
microwave radiation

481
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,340
will literally

482
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:23,320
cook our planet.

483
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,880
Dr. Zimsky.

484
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:27,570
This is the Sun.

485
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:32,220
This is the Earth...
without the EM Field.

486
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:34,040
Would you?

487
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:35,310
Mm-hmm.

488
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:47,570
Three months, gentlemen,
and we're back in the Stone Age.

489
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,800
A full year,
the field collapses...

490
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,120
and that.

491
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,070
May I?

492
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,950
Feel free to throw up.
I know I did.

493
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:06,010
So, how do we fix it?

494
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:06,900
We can't.

495
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:07,920
Not in my vocabulary.

496
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,340
Then you might want
to get one of those

497
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,930
Word-A-Day calendars,
General, because

498
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,900
it's impossible.

499
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:12,970
The core is the size
of Mars.

500
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:14,710
You're talking about
jump-starting a planet.

501
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,530
This is a superheated
hyper-fluid

502
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,190
of molten iron and nickel
at 9,000 degrees Fahrenheit,

503
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,490
2,000 miles down,
1,000 miles thick.

504
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:25,790
And the deepest we've ever been
is... seven miles

505
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:27,340
with a two-inch drill bit.

506
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,660
If we can go into space,
we certainly...

507
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:29,620
Well, space is easy.

508
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:30,420
It's empty.

509
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:32,380
We're talking
about millions of pounds

510
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,810
of pressure
per square inch.

511
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:37,020
Even if we somehow
came up with a brilliant plan

512
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,870
to fix the core,
we just can't get there.

513
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:42,420
Yes, but...

514
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:49,270
...what if we could?

515
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,940
Hello, Braz.

516
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:44,970
Why the hell
aren't you dead yet?

517
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,570
Okay, this way.

518
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,500
Well, that went better
than I expected.

519
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:53,610
Dr. Brazzleton,

520
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:54,900
I see you know Dr. Zimsky.

521
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:55,980
Yeah.

522
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:58,290
20 years ago,
he stole my research.

523
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,270
After that,
we-we kind of lost touch.

524
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:01,940
Research that
was equally mine.

525
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,600
That's funny,
I don't remember a check

526
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:04,650
from any of the patents.

527
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:07,410
All right, Braz.

528
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,580
20 years in the desert makes
you a prophet and a martyr.

529
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:13,030
Look, we're here
about your legendary ship.

530
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:16,940
Okay, I'm combining
high-frequency pulse lasers

531
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:18,700
with resonance tube ultrasonics.

532
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,880
If you've ever seen
ultrasonic waves

533
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:23,820
break up a kidney stone
on the Discovery Channel,

534
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:24,940
it's the same deal here.

535
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:28,560
You can...
put your helmets on now.

536
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:29,870
Firing.

537
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,810
Woo-ooh!

538
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:55,120
Woo-hoo!

539
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,790
Yeah. Oh.

540
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:19,630
Okay, I'm officially impressed.

541
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:27,880
So, all right.

542
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:29,130
So you've made some progress

543
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:31,760
with the engine,
we'll grant you.

544
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:35,170
Have you begun to think
about a shell?

545
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:37,870
Okay, this is Alex.

546
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:40,250
Okay, Alex. Good.

547
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:43,280
Okay, here we have
a concrete block,

548
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:46,640
and in back of that,
we have a two-inch steel plate.

549
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:53,040
Okay. We're ready.

550
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:01,130
And we are... firing.

551
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,220
Voila!

552
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,630
That's...

553
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,260
That's impossible.

554
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:27,060
I combined the crystals

555
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,290
in a tungsten-titanium matrix
at supercool temperatures,

556
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:33,160
and that's what did the trick.

557
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:35,530
The applications
for this are just...

558
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,830
What do you call this material?

559
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:40,200
Well, its real name
has 37 syllables.

560
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:42,000
I call it Unobtainium.

561
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:43,560
Unobtainium?

562
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,940
Mm-hmm.

563
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:47,530
The Unobtainium will take
the heat and the pressure

564
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,980
and transform it to energy,

565
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:51,940
which in turn, reinforces
the shell of the ship, you see.

566
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,840
So the hotter
and the deeper she gets,

567
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:56,010
the stronger she gets...
theoretically.

568
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,490
Theoretically?

569
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:59,120
Theoretically, yes.

570
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:02,060
This... is Johnson,
don't mind him.

571
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:05,540
This is the prototype
for the cockpit here.

572
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:06,890
Excuse me,
Dr. Brazzleton,

573
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,780
when do you think
the ship will be operational?

574
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:12,200
When I get my fabrication
methods perfected...

575
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:14,250
12... ten years, ten years.

576
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:17,550
What would it take to get
it done in three months?

577
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:23,310
$15 billion. I...

578
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:27,630
Will you take a check?

579
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,180
Why don't you use a credit card?
You get miles.

580
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:32,300
Mm.

581
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,460
Shit!

582
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:40,650
Mr. Finch, this is the FBI.
We have a warrant.

583
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,320
Purge!

584
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,730
Come on, purge!

585
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:05,580
FBI! Freeze!

586
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,240
Okay.

587
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:18,760
I know these
look like computers.

588
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:22,130
Totally not.

589
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,090
Theodore Donald Finch.

590
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,360
Carnegie-Mellon University.
M.I.T.

591
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:27,730
Worked at the Sun,
Lucent, Rand Corp.

592
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,350
My handle's "Rat."
Call me Rat.

593
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:31,840
63 computer fraud indictments.

594
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,720
64.

595
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:34,730
Two convictions.

596
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:38,850
This is strike three, Mr. Finch.

597
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:39,850
Wait a second.

598
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,580
You guys aren't here
to whack me, are you?

599
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,890
Because I was really,
really hoping to have sex

600
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:44,960
before that happened.

601
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,450
Yeah. I've been told
by the FBl...

602
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:50,600
whose database you crippled
last year...

603
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:52,680
that you are
the best in the business.

604
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:54,750
So you're about
to be given a choice.

605
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:55,850
What if I say no?

606
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:58,090
Excuse me, but is this really

607
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,680
the best we could do?

608
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,870
I mean...

609
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:01,770
How many languages do you speak?

610
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,210
Five, actually.

611
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,010
Well, I speak one.

612
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:07,620
One, zero, one, zero, zero.

613
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:12,240
With that, I could steal
your money, your secrets,

614
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:14,600
your sexual fantasies,
your whole life,

615
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:18,890
any country, any place,
anytime I want.

616
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,330
We multitask
like you breathe.

617
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,330
I couldn't think
as slow as you if I tried.

618
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,440
Do you have any idea...?

619
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,420
Okay, hey. Hey!

620
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:31,690
Let's just, let's give
the kid a break.

621
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,820
Okay, it's a phone.

622
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:37,990
It's just a phone.

623
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:44,170
Rat, we got a big problem.

624
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:46,210
A lot of people
are going to die.

625
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,360
We need your help.

626
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,380
What kind of help?

627
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,840
Information control.

628
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:52,460
We need you to control the flow
of information on the Internet.

629
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:55,390
You're dreaming.
Nobody controls the 'Net.

630
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:57,610
Could you...
with unlimited resources?

631
00:33:57,710 --> 00:34:01,060
You want me to hack the planet?

632
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:04,880
He wants me to hack the planet.

633
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,400
You've got free long distance

634
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:14,150
on that phone... forever.

635
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,930
Okay.

636
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:19,630
If I decide to do this...

637
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:21,830
I'm going to need
an unlimited supply

638
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:24,680
of Xena tapes and Hot Pockets.

639
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:26,660
Hot Pockets?

640
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:28,320
They help me concentrate.

641
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:30,640
Sounds fair.

642
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:41,890
Major Childs,
they're ready for you.

643
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,920
Major Childs,

644
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:49,320
a clarification:

645
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:50,770
You and you alone
were responsible

646
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:52,110
for proposing
the descent vectors

647
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:53,110
for the shuttle, correct?

648
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:54,440
Yes, General.

649
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:57,350
We have determined that
the Class "A" landing mishap

650
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:59,400
experienced by
the Shuttle EndeavOur

651
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,850
was caused by biased
navigational data

652
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,640
from the ground due to a brief
geomagnetic disturbance.

653
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:08,040
Major Childs,
the resourcefulness you showed

654
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,280
in determining
the descent vectors proved

655
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:13,380
that you have exceptional
navigation skills.

656
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:15,420
You've brought much credit
upon yourself,

657
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,920
the space program
and the United States Air Force.

658
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:19,330
Congratulations, Major.

659
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,280
You are reassigned

660
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:24,710
with Commander Iverson
and Flight Director Stickley

661
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:27,200
to a new mission
effective immediately.

662
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:28,730
Transportation
is waiting outside.

663
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,740
Good luck and Godspeed, Major.

664
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:58,440
Are you sure you want
to wear this tie?

665
00:35:58,540 --> 00:35:59,400
Why?

666
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,360
I don't know.

667
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,870
I mean, you look so
nervous about it.

668
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:02,980
You look so...

669
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:05,160
So, how are you holding up?

670
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:06,470
Oh, hi. I'm good, I'm good.

671
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,390
I'm about to tell
a couple hundred people

672
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,840
the world is going to end.

673
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:10,800
Well...

674
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:11,750
I've had better days.

675
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,670
You look good.

676
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,330
Well, no, you don't look good.

677
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,260
Why did he touch his tie
like that?

678
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,210
Thomas, let me speak
with you for a moment.

679
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:21,030
Listen, wouldn't you
rather I did this?

680
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:23,000
I mean, given my reputation,
I think that...

681
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,060
No. No, Keyes is in
the lead here, Zimsky.

682
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:26,980
Yes. Thomas, this is
the most important

683
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:28,550
scientific operation
in history.

684
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:31,270
And given my status, I feel that
it's my job to present...

685
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:32,930
Project Destiny
was your job, Zimsky.

686
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,970
And you went way beyond
authorized limits.

687
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:36,770
And let me tell...
And let me tell you,

688
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:41,030
I still, I want to know
if Destiny caused this problem.

689
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,400
It's highly unlikely,
but it may be the solution.

690
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:45,120
Now, I have not
finished checking...

691
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:47,680
Excuse me.

692
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:52,480
Rebecca...
I'm so glad I was wrong.

693
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:53,760
Right over left...

694
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,360
No, the other left,
the other left.

695
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:56,650
- Gentlemen.
- And then you...

696
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:57,890
Gentlemen.

697
00:36:58,030 --> 00:37:00,890
Commander Iverson,
Major Childs,

698
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:03,170
this is your crew:

699
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,960
Dr. Brazzleton knows the ship;

700
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:06,080
Hello.

701
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:07,190
Dr. Zimsky knows the planet;

702
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:08,160
Doctor.

703
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:10,020
Dr. Leveque knows
the weapons system;

704
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:11,160
Excuse me, ladies first.

705
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,190
Hi.

706
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:13,980
And Dr. Keyes...

707
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:16,120
Dr. Keyes built
the navigation system, so...

708
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:17,250
Hi. Rebecca Childs.

709
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,530
Bob Iverson.

710
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:22,340
These are your fellow...
fellow... what?

711
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,350
Terranauts?

712
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:24,770
Hello.

713
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:25,890
All this brain power over here

714
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,840
is starting to smell
like burning batteries.

715
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:29,340
Y'all better come and join in.

716
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:30,430
Yeah.

717
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:33,990
It's the simplest things
that are the hardest, huh?

718
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:35,270
Yeah. It's official.

719
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:37,990
I'm the least-qualified person
on this base.

720
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:39,620
Dr. Keyes,
I'm sure the people in charge

721
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:40,830
have every confidence in you.

722
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,790
Well, the problem is that
I'm in charge.

723
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:44,550
Yeah, I know.

724
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:45,660
Can I help you?

725
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:47,400
Yes, please.

726
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:51,190
You're an astronaut,
and you can tie a Windsor?

727
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:52,220
Mm-hmm.

728
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,300
Is there anything you can't do?

729
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:57,310
Not that I'm aware of.

730
00:37:57,380 --> 00:38:00,450
I find that
incredibly intimidating.

731
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:03,420
Yep. Most people do.

732
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,530
Here.

733
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:06,590
Thank you.

734
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:08,090
You're welcome.

735
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:14,050
Let me introduce our project
leader, Dr. Joshua Keyes.

736
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:16,640
Thank you, thank you.

737
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:20,190
Good evening. Good evening.

738
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:22,590
Wow. This looks like a meeting

739
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:25,280
for Nobel Prize Winners
Anonymous.

740
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:28,220
I know you are all
the finest in your fields

741
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:30,490
and have come a long way
to be here.

742
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:34,790
So, I'll outline our program
over the next three months.

743
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:41,000
Dr. Brazzleton will supervise
the building of a ship

744
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:43,780
which is capable of reaching
the center of our planet.

745
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,230
Once there, it will deliver
an explosive charge

746
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:51,200
large enough
to restart its core.

747
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:52,610
Dr. Zimsky will calculate

748
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,530
the scale
of the explosion needed.

749
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:58,310
This is a program I designed
to simulate the effect

750
00:38:58,370 --> 00:38:59,870
of nuclear detonations
on the core.

751
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:02,500
If my calculations are correct,
a tiny nudge in any direction

752
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,470
will force the core back
into its normal flow.

753
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,280
What's a "tiny nudge"
in planetary terms?

754
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:07,690
A thousand megatons,
give or take?

755
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:09,180
Tops. Because any more than that

756
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:11,670
would create
a core instability.

757
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:14,470
We made a few monster warheads
in the 200-megaton range.

758
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:18,360
Braz, do you think the ship
can handle five of these babies?

759
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,960
Yeah. I can enlarge
the ejection pod...

760
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:21,970
Forgive me,

761
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:24,030
but, you know, I know
I'm not the expert here,

762
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,980
but what if the core
is thicker or thinner?

763
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:28,050
I mean, what if it's not
what you think it is?

764
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:30,620
Isn't that going to affect
the way the explosions are...?

765
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:32,120
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

766
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:35,130
And what if the core
is made of cheese?

767
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,820
This is all best
guess, Commander.

768
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:40,740
That's all science is,
is best guess.

769
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,750
So my best guess is
you don't know.

770
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:44,960
With luck, irony will break
for the good guys for once,

771
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:46,850
and the world's biggest weapons
of mass destruction

772
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:49,370
will help save the world.

773
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,850
The ship will be powered

774
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,290
by a small experimental
nuclear reactor.

775
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:55,480
It will be divided
into six compartments

776
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,830
like cars on a train:

777
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,970
The locomotive unit,
navigation compartment,

778
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:02,040
living quarters, engineering,
bomb compartment

779
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,420
and finally
the weapons-control module.

780
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,030
Up to a 45 degree angle, every
compartment will be held level

781
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,980
by these gyro control gimbals.

782
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:12,640
But if we do breach a section,

783
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:15,520
bulkhead doors engage
automatically,

784
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:18,750
seal off the section in red,
and eject.

785
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:21,090
Is ejection really
the best option?

786
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,270
Only option.

787
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:25,540
Each damaged compartment
degrades the entire hull.

788
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:27,910
The objective is simple.

789
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:29,850
The obstacles are gigantic.

790
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:31,650
We're going to need
all the help in the world,

791
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:33,440
but if we are to avoid
panic and chaos,

792
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:37,540
the world at large can never
know what's happening here.

793
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:39,700
Which is where our friend
Mr. Rat comes in.

794
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:40,670
It's called Virus-bot.

795
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:42,330
It's a computer virus
that will seek out files

796
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,440
anywhere on the Web that contain
keywords that we designate

797
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:46,450
and wipes them out.

798
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:50,520
This is my Kung-Fu,
and it is strong.

799
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:54,200
Meanwhile, there are
a million puzzles ahead of us,

800
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:55,770
and we have three months
to solve them.

801
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,500
We have a committed
and ingenious team.

802
00:40:57,570 --> 00:40:59,570
We have every resource available
to us,

803
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:00,930
and we have the best

804
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:03,710
of the world's scientific and
technical talents on our side.

805
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:07,940
With your help we can,
we must... succeed.

806
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:13,310
Feedback in the resonance tube.

807
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:14,010
Talk to me, gentlemen.

808
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:14,940
We are losing

809
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:15,910
structural integrity.

810
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:17,020
No, it's not feedback.

811
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:18,680
It's an impeller malfunction,
I believe.

812
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:20,280
No, it's not, no. If it were
an impeller malfunction...

813
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,390
For God's sakes, Braz,
make the call!

814
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:24,220
No, I'll make the call.
I should make the call.

815
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:26,040
65 knots.

816
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:27,900
Depth, 8-5 thousand feet.

817
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:29,720
Look, guys...

818
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:33,820
It's a disaster!

819
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:41,630
What part of "talk to me"
don't you guys understand?

820
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:43,420
For the 22nd time in a row,

821
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:45,080
everyone on Earth is dead.

822
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,940
Let's take a little quiet time,

823
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,850
and you all are going
to try this again.

824
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:54,680
Hi.

825
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:57,980
Hi.

826
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,950
What is this?

827
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:04,440
Well, it's...
I invented it.

828
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:07,190
It's how you're going to...
going to steer underground.

829
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:08,670
It's, um...

830
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,400
not very good reception.

831
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:12,790
Well, you're looking

832
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:15,890
through three feet of lead
at 50 yards away, so...

833
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:17,180
it ain't bad.

834
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:20,560
It's like a CAT scan
at a hospital,

835
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,010
but it's-it's souped-up.

836
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:24,380
I invented it

837
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:25,490
for Deep Earth surveying.

838
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:27,900
And then the government came in,
bought my research,

839
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:30,450
paid off my student loan guys
and made me a consultant.

840
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:32,210
I'm sorry,
this is really delicate.

841
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:34,110
And I have it
just the way I want it.

842
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:36,990
So... excuse me.

843
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:38,360
Uh, yeah.

844
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:40,820
Then they brought me in
when the pacemakers quit,

845
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:43,900
and... boom...
you know, I'm Apocalypse Boy.

846
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:46,260
Apocalypse Boy?

847
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:49,880
Yeah. I'm having T-shirts
made up.

848
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:51,900
Well, hats sell better.

849
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:54,550
You know, it's funny,
because that is...

850
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:56,150
right where it should be.

851
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:57,120
Well...

852
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:58,970
I'm sorry. I'm a little
ragged around the edges.

853
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,080
I'm just trying to get
this thing to focus correctly.

854
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:02,580
This is really cool,
but can I just...?

855
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:04,540
Well... mm-hmm.

856
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:17,820
It's better.
It's better. Uh...

857
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:46,140
God, I hate this sky.

858
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:29,690
Crashing one ship
isn't enough for you?

859
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,380
Hey. Practice makes perfect.

860
00:44:31,450 --> 00:44:32,940
You can practice all you like.

861
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:35,510
It doesn't mean you're ready
to sit in that seat.

862
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:38,230
So you keep reminding me, sir.

863
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,200
You know, I doubt

864
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:40,600
you're even going
to listen to this,

865
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:42,130
but I'm going to give it a shot.

866
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:47,160
Being a leader
isn't about ability.

867
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:49,020
It's about responsibility.

868
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,510
Got it, sir.

869
00:44:50,590 --> 00:44:51,660
No, you don't, Beck.

870
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,230
I mean,
you're not just responsible

871
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:54,390
for making good decisions.

872
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:56,800
You have to be responsible
for the bad ones.

873
00:44:56,860 --> 00:45:00,470
You got to be ready
to make the shitty call.

874
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:01,400
What makes you think
I'm not?

875
00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:02,710
Because you're so good.

876
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:06,100
You haven't hit anything
you couldn't beat.

877
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:07,180
I mean, hell,

878
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:09,850
you were the one who figured out
how to save the shuttle.

879
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:12,850
You made me, you made the rest
of NASA just look like an ass.

880
00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:16,850
It's just that
you're used to winning...

881
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:22,230
...and you're not really
a leader until you've lost.

882
00:45:25,310 --> 00:45:28,690
$20 billion has been spent
developing this system...

883
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,730
Oh, come on, guys,
the chefs at NASA...

884
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:34,800
I want wine!
I need wine!

885
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:37,460
It's about nutrition.
In five days, I think...

886
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,660
Whoa!

887
00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:43,630
That's high-level
static discharge.

888
00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:48,440
I think we should
check this out.

889
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:50,030
This doesn't look so good.

890
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:59,310
It's a lightning superstorm.

891
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:01,010
Popping up all over the world.

892
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:03,350
Got 'em. Tracking.

893
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:08,370
Uh-oh. Rome does not look good.

894
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:57,230
This planet is decaying faster
than we thought.

895
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:58,510
It's just the start.

896
00:47:58,590 --> 00:48:00,440
Soon they'll be EM spikes

897
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:02,640
and microwaves will break
through the weak spots and...

898
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:05,810
All right. Get this ship
in the ground. Now.

899
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:38,450
Ah! Summer in the Pacific.

900
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:40,180
Yeah, the world is inside out.

901
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:03,890
I was saving this for later,
but...

902
00:49:03,950 --> 00:49:05,610
this is the time for...

903
00:49:07,350 --> 00:49:08,490
Josh, do you mind?

904
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:09,680
No, not at all. Yeah.

905
00:49:11,090 --> 00:49:12,270
We should have a name
for this baby.

906
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:14,250
Oh, she's called virgil,
actually.

907
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:16,530
Virgil... the poet that led
our man into the depths of hell?

908
00:49:16,590 --> 00:49:17,650
That's it.

909
00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:18,760
That's appropriate, I guess.

910
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:19,910
Well, here's to virgil.

911
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:22,580
To the planet.

912
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:23,570
- To virgil.
- To virgil.

913
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:33,450
No flashbulbs, no press,
nobody cheering.

914
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:34,800
It's... weird.

915
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,610
Let's go.

916
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:57,540
Cabin pressure, TSI, 3.5.

917
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:59,050
Check.

918
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:01,330
ECS cabin repress open.

919
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:04,070
And repress VLV closed.

920
00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:05,430
Check.

921
00:50:05,490 --> 00:50:06,630
Fluid dump valve.

922
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:08,260
We are about to begin
our journey

923
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:10,060
into the heart of the cosmos,

924
00:50:10,130 --> 00:50:12,140
into the very core
of our own planet.

925
00:50:12,210 --> 00:50:13,420
Close.

926
00:50:13,490 --> 00:50:15,430
- Where we find therein...
- Check.

927
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:17,840
The secrets of the universe...

928
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:19,050
...3.5 PSI.

929
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:20,810
...the mysteries of time...

930
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,820
LM circuit lockup.

931
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:24,900
- Check.
...hope for the future.

932
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:25,870
And signal.

933
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:27,310
Deep Earth Control,
this is virgil.

934
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:28,720
Signal check.

935
00:50:28,790 --> 00:50:30,540
This is Deep Earth Control.

936
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:32,910
I have thumbs-up
across the board.

937
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:35,310
You are clear
to initiate power-up.

938
00:50:43,890 --> 00:50:45,990
Reactor power confirmed.

939
00:50:46,070 --> 00:50:50,090
At 1,000 rpm, we will countdown
to launch. On your mark.

940
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:51,920
Pad leader, stand by for launch.

941
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:55,240
All right, virgil.

942
00:50:57,390 --> 00:50:58,150
Mark.

943
00:50:58,230 --> 00:51:01,160
Gantry count. Ten, nine,

944
00:51:01,230 --> 00:51:05,990
eight, seven, six, five, four,

945
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:08,390
three, two, one...

946
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:10,480
launch.

947
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,370
500 feet.

948
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,160
Leveling out.

949
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:59,400
Okay, guys,
let's swing forward.

950
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:06,500
800 feet.

951
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:08,290
Light 'em up, Beck.

952
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:13,930
Gyro leveling operational.

953
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,690
Hull integrity holding.

954
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:47,980
I'm going to keep her nose
down about 15 degrees and...

955
00:52:49,290 --> 00:52:51,910
Oh, my goodness.

956
00:53:12,490 --> 00:53:14,310
They're singing to us.

957
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:16,970
Virgil's resonance tubes
are powered up,

958
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,410
so they're vibrating
sub sonically.

959
00:53:18,470 --> 00:53:20,420
Actually, we're singing to them.

960
00:53:33,290 --> 00:53:34,500
What's our depth?

961
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:37,060
1,600 feet,
plenty of room on both sides.

962
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:38,120
Hull integrity is good.

963
00:53:38,190 --> 00:53:39,530
You sure?

964
00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:40,520
Let's increase impeller speed.

965
00:53:40,590 --> 00:53:42,280
I think we'll be needing
additional control.

966
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:47,460
Stick, I'm getting
a seismic reading.

967
00:53:47,530 --> 00:53:48,460
What's happening?

968
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:51,400
T-phase.
Underwater earthquake.

969
00:53:57,490 --> 00:53:58,970
Still think the water-launch
was a good idea?

970
00:53:59,050 --> 00:54:01,900
Yes, yes, I chose this location
because the crust is thin here.

971
00:54:01,970 --> 00:54:04,450
The downside is... there's lots
of seismic activity.

972
00:54:04,530 --> 00:54:05,600
4,000 feet.

973
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:09,540
You see that rock?

974
00:54:09,610 --> 00:54:10,760
That is not good.

975
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:19,270
We're losing steering here.

976
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:20,680
There's some kind
of crosscurrent.

977
00:54:22,630 --> 00:54:23,780
14,000 feet.

978
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,550
Okay, guys, fasten
your seat belts.

979
00:54:39,630 --> 00:54:41,350
We're turning into the skid.

980
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:53,500
18,000.

981
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:55,130
18,500.

982
00:54:55,210 --> 00:54:56,640
They're going way too fast.

983
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:11,750
21,000 feet.

984
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:12,710
We hit the wall,

985
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:13,760
we're rabbits on the highway.

986
00:55:13,830 --> 00:55:15,240
Pressure, pressure,
pressure, pressure.

987
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:16,550
What do you mean, pressure?

988
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:18,040
I thought you said this
thing was indestructible!

989
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:19,170
I said the pressure
makes us stronger.

990
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:20,290
We just don't have
enough of it yet.

991
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:23,970
We're at 25,000 feet.
Pull out, sir.

992
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:24,930
Can't.

993
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,340
- What?
- We're locked in.

994
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:28,930
Go to full throttle.

995
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,830
Standby to engage front
and lateral lasers, please.

996
00:55:32,910 --> 00:55:35,080
But what if we hit bottom
in ten seconds here?

997
00:55:35,140 --> 00:55:36,830
Just give it
a couple more seconds.

998
00:55:36,910 --> 00:55:38,120
The lasers will fire.

999
00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:43,360
No, there's not enough time
for power-up.

1000
00:55:47,690 --> 00:55:49,100
27,000 feet.

1001
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:50,790
The lasers will deploy.

1002
00:55:53,510 --> 00:55:54,690
29,000 feet.

1003
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:56,360
- Do it!
- And...

1004
00:55:57,860 --> 00:55:59,210
Do it! Now.

1005
00:56:42,630 --> 00:56:45,500
And we've got a signal.

1006
00:56:45,570 --> 00:56:46,690
- All right.
- Yeah!

1007
00:56:52,010 --> 00:56:53,470
All right.

1008
00:56:55,940 --> 00:56:57,600
Switching on electron spin burst
transmitters.

1009
00:56:57,710 --> 00:56:59,970
Plotting through
lowest density material,

1010
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:01,530
reconfiguring
every five minutes.

1011
00:57:01,610 --> 00:57:05,050
Hull integrity 100%.
Reactor power 100%.

1012
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:06,140
All green
on the bomb compartment.

1013
00:57:06,210 --> 00:57:07,910
Speed is 60 knots.

1014
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:10,050
Hot damn.

1015
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:12,610
All right, we'll be through
the crust in 15 minutes

1016
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:13,720
and into the mantle.

1017
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:15,800
24 hours to the core, and
then assuming we survive...

1018
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:18,050
Assuming?
Yes, assuming.

1019
00:57:18,110 --> 00:57:21,220
Another 15 hours to the
inner core-outer core border.

1020
00:57:21,290 --> 00:57:23,620
They're doing well.

1021
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:25,320
The crust is just rock.

1022
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:27,590
Now it gets interesting.

1023
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:29,060
Virgil, can we get
a status check?

1024
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:31,190
We're about to make
the transition into the mantle.

1025
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:01,440
Come on, come on.

1026
00:58:14,630 --> 00:58:18,450
Well, exterior pressure
is 800,000 pounds

1027
00:58:18,530 --> 00:58:19,940
per square inch.

1028
00:58:20,010 --> 00:58:21,720
And hull integrity is 100%.

1029
00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:25,380
It is as if we we're diving
through the memories

1030
00:58:25,450 --> 00:58:26,490
of the planet.

1031
00:58:26,570 --> 00:58:28,710
But we are about to pass
from memory

1032
00:58:28,770 --> 00:58:30,560
into madness.

1033
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:34,270
Are you going to be doing
that Carl Sagan narration

1034
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:35,390
all the way to the core?

1035
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:37,830
- I beg your pardon?
- I said...

1036
00:58:37,890 --> 00:58:39,990
l-I have an obligation to
my students, to my readers...

1037
00:58:40,070 --> 00:58:41,560
An obligation to make
a book deal perhaps?

1038
00:58:41,630 --> 00:58:43,130
Two book deals,
if you'd like to know the truth.

1039
00:58:43,210 --> 00:58:45,720
I read that last book.
It wasn't very good.

1040
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:46,750
Oh, really? Really?

1041
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:48,030
When did you learn how to read?

1042
00:59:07,330 --> 00:59:08,530
People.

1043
00:59:08,610 --> 00:59:10,820
Drs. Zimsky and Keyes?

1044
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:16,720
You guys are
our resident geophysicists.

1045
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:18,170
What do you make of this?

1046
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:19,610
The mantle
is a chemical hodgepodge

1047
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:21,950
of... a variety of elements...

1048
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:26,320
Say it with me:
"I don't know."

1049
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:27,930
Well, Commander,

1050
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,490
wise men say, "When in doubt,
you should go around."

1051
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:31,160
No. It's too big.

1052
00:59:31,230 --> 00:59:32,510
We turn too slow.

1053
00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:35,060
Anything that
we can't go through

1054
00:59:35,140 --> 00:59:36,180
displays as black.

1055
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:37,400
So what's... what's static?

1056
00:59:37,470 --> 00:59:39,710
It's nothing.

1057
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:41,120
What do you mean?

1058
00:59:41,180 --> 00:59:43,970
It's nothing.

1059
00:59:44,030 --> 00:59:46,780
It's empty space.

1060
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:49,300
I...

1061
00:59:50,850 --> 00:59:52,710
I never taught the computer
how to read empty space.

1062
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:53,980
And I never taught virgil
how to fly.

1063
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:56,020
Oh, God!

1064
01:00:17,850 --> 01:00:18,690
Oh, no, man!

1065
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:32,780
Oh, dear God.

1066
01:01:23,390 --> 01:01:24,700
Serge, you all right?

1067
01:01:26,270 --> 01:01:28,380
Yeah.

1068
01:01:33,820 --> 01:01:35,250
Anybody hurt?

1069
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:37,430
No. You okay?

1070
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:38,390
Yeah.

1071
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:39,950
What's that?
What is that?

1072
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:41,490
From the cooling system.
Shut that down.

1073
01:01:41,590 --> 01:01:43,350
Shut it down.

1074
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:45,250
I told you to go around her.

1075
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:46,710
Nobody listens to me.

1076
01:01:46,780 --> 01:01:47,860
Where in God's name are we?

1077
01:01:47,930 --> 01:01:49,750
Whatever has us jammed up
is inside our lasers.

1078
01:01:49,820 --> 01:01:50,770
Shut 'em down.

1079
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:55,820
We're not going anywhere.

1080
01:01:59,230 --> 01:02:00,600
Powering down.

1081
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:09,690
Josh, is there any other image
you can pull up?

1082
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:10,680
Nope.

1083
01:02:10,750 --> 01:02:14,160
Whatever it is, it's also inside
our MRI cameras.

1084
01:02:15,580 --> 01:02:16,920
We have to go outside.

1085
01:02:16,990 --> 01:02:17,880
What?

1086
01:02:17,950 --> 01:02:19,160
Believe me,
I hate to admit it,

1087
01:02:19,220 --> 01:02:20,270
but I think he's right.

1088
01:02:20,350 --> 01:02:21,800
I'm coming.
I want to collect samples.

1089
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:23,090
Wait, hang on, hang on.

1090
01:02:23,170 --> 01:02:24,470
Wait, wait,
the first problem is,

1091
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:26,710
the only way out of the ship...
is the way we came in,

1092
01:02:26,780 --> 01:02:28,180
which is through
the impeller outlet...

1093
01:02:28,250 --> 01:02:29,270
Which is still
at 5,000 degrees.

1094
01:02:29,340 --> 01:02:30,800
Exactly, I mean...

1095
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:33,110
I'll just flush it
with liquid nitrogen

1096
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:34,220
from the cooling system.

1097
01:02:34,370 --> 01:02:35,440
Wait. The cooling system

1098
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:38,030
that's keeping us from
roasting to death in this ship?

1099
01:02:38,110 --> 01:02:41,490
Well, just a small part of it.

1100
01:02:43,710 --> 01:02:46,290
Alternatives?

1101
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:48,020
Anybody.

1102
01:03:01,950 --> 01:03:04,320
Whoa, whoa, that's it.

1103
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:07,830
It's like a giant...
giant crystal.

1104
01:03:07,890 --> 01:03:09,210
Where the hell are we?

1105
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:10,700
Well, the good news is,

1106
01:03:10,780 --> 01:03:12,630
it looks like the suits
can take the pressure.

1107
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:16,470
It's completely jammed
the laser assembly.

1108
01:03:16,570 --> 01:03:17,740
We just...
we got to hope,

1109
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:18,890
if we can cut it loose,

1110
01:03:18,970 --> 01:03:20,080
- they're still functional.
- Careful!

1111
01:03:20,150 --> 01:03:22,900
Okay.

1112
01:03:22,970 --> 01:03:23,990
Got it.

1113
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:26,230
Beck, try the lights, will you?

1114
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:27,480
Lighting up.

1115
01:03:31,710 --> 01:03:32,500
Oh, it's magnificent.

1116
01:03:32,570 --> 01:03:34,960
Oh, my God.

1117
01:03:35,030 --> 01:03:38,040
Aladdin's cave.

1118
01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:40,490
It's like
a crystal Grand Canyon.

1119
01:03:55,770 --> 01:03:57,040
I think it's a geode.

1120
01:03:57,110 --> 01:03:58,480
But I don't understand

1121
01:03:58,550 --> 01:04:00,940
how it could have survived
down here.

1122
01:04:01,010 --> 01:04:02,330
Cobalt shell, maybe?

1123
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:03,440
No. L-I mean,

1124
01:04:03,550 --> 01:04:05,850
in a magma environment
of 5,000 degrees.

1125
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:07,920
Something would have
to protect it.

1126
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Unbelievable.

1127
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:09,970
Zimsky.

1128
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:11,250
Yeah?

1129
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:14,490
We're inside
a giant gem bubble,

1130
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:17,070
wrapped in a cobalt cocoon

1131
01:04:17,150 --> 01:04:19,860
700 miles below the surface
of the Earth.

1132
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:22,860
Hell of a day.

1133
01:04:24,090 --> 01:04:26,260
Yes, it is.

1134
01:04:26,330 --> 01:04:27,380
I'll start cutting.

1135
01:04:27,510 --> 01:04:28,560
Okay, Braz.

1136
01:04:28,630 --> 01:04:29,530
I'm going to check the hull.

1137
01:04:29,590 --> 01:04:30,640
Call me if you need me.

1138
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:32,170
Okay.

1139
01:04:39,290 --> 01:04:40,750
Oh, no.

1140
01:04:40,820 --> 01:04:42,620
- Zimsky!
- Yeah?

1141
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:43,800
Zimsky, look!

1142
01:04:43,860 --> 01:04:45,360
It's an amethyst.

1143
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:46,960
Oh, God,

1144
01:04:47,030 --> 01:04:48,890
we've breached the shell.

1145
01:05:04,430 --> 01:05:05,780
Guys, you don't have to be here!

1146
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:07,410
I want you back inside!

1147
01:05:07,470 --> 01:05:09,240
Well, I think that means me.

1148
01:05:09,310 --> 01:05:10,730
Orders are orders.

1149
01:05:18,170 --> 01:05:20,370
Wait, Josh.

1150
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:22,990
The problem is
I'm losing oxygen.

1151
01:05:23,130 --> 01:05:23,760
Braz, what can I do?

1152
01:05:23,830 --> 01:05:25,290
Check the feeds for me.

1153
01:05:25,370 --> 01:05:28,590
Check the feeds for me, Josh.

1154
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:33,070
Quick!

1155
01:05:33,140 --> 01:05:34,320
I'm coming. I'm coming
as fast as I can.

1156
01:05:34,390 --> 01:05:35,470
Hey, guys, at this rate

1157
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:37,300
we have three minutes
before the lava gets to us.

1158
01:05:37,370 --> 01:05:38,340
Come on, guys.

1159
01:05:38,490 --> 01:05:39,630
Come on.

1160
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:46,930
It's not going to work
without oxygen!

1161
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,900
We're losing oxygen!

1162
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:58,770
I fixed it. Now cut!

1163
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:00,360
That's good. It's working now.

1164
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:01,680
It's working well now!

1165
01:06:01,740 --> 01:06:03,400
That's good, Josh!

1166
01:06:13,950 --> 01:06:13,950
Josh's vital signs are dropping.

1167
01:06:15,550 --> 01:06:17,280
What?

1168
01:06:22,590 --> 01:06:24,320
Serge!

1169
01:06:25,830 --> 01:06:28,060
You're almost there.

1170
01:06:28,130 --> 01:06:31,290
You're almost there, Josh.

1171
01:06:43,070 --> 01:06:44,480
Josh!

1172
01:06:59,580 --> 01:07:00,730
Joshua!

1173
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:02,900
Okay, guys,

1174
01:07:02,980 --> 01:07:03,960
connect the oxygen.

1175
01:07:04,030 --> 01:07:05,050
Braz, you got that?

1176
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:06,050
Yes. Connected!

1177
01:07:06,110 --> 01:07:08,160
Good. I got to check
these lasers.

1178
01:07:08,220 --> 01:07:11,640
Okay, Beck, turn 'em over.

1179
01:07:11,770 --> 01:07:14,200
Pre-lasers only,
if you don't mind.

1180
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:15,350
Initiating.

1181
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:17,910
This better work.

1182
01:07:17,990 --> 01:07:20,510
The tide's really coming in.

1183
01:07:21,990 --> 01:07:23,170
Yes!

1184
01:07:23,260 --> 01:07:25,270
We got lucky...
I think we're going

1185
01:07:25,340 --> 01:07:26,620
to swim right out of this one.

1186
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:30,840
Bob?

1187
01:07:30,910 --> 01:07:32,990
Huh?

1188
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:47,450
Bob?

1189
01:07:52,990 --> 01:07:54,400
Bob...

1190
01:07:58,300 --> 01:07:59,650
Braz, come on, it's over.

1191
01:07:59,770 --> 01:08:01,810
Okay. Okay.

1192
01:08:01,890 --> 01:08:03,890
Beck! Beck!

1193
01:08:03,970 --> 01:08:06,480
We're coming in.

1194
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:08,890
Initiate start sequence.

1195
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:10,420
Beck!

1196
01:08:10,490 --> 01:08:12,060
- Beck, do you hear me?
- Careful.

1197
01:08:12,190 --> 01:08:15,040
Start the impellers!

1198
01:08:17,340 --> 01:08:19,860
The door, open the door.

1199
01:08:19,940 --> 01:08:22,490
Activate bulkhead doors!

1200
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:24,830
Now, Beck!

1201
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:05,370
You okay?
You're going to be weak.

1202
01:09:05,430 --> 01:09:06,330
You're okay.

1203
01:09:06,390 --> 01:09:07,930
Good job, good job.
Good man.

1204
01:09:07,990 --> 01:09:09,150
Well done, well done.

1205
01:09:09,210 --> 01:09:10,300
I'm fine. Thank you.

1206
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:11,260
So, um...

1207
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:14,640
we have some good news,
and, uh...

1208
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:15,900
and we have some bad news.

1209
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:18,350
Uh, good news.
I'll take good news.

1210
01:09:18,430 --> 01:09:19,320
All right.

1211
01:09:19,390 --> 01:09:21,660
Well, we're alive
and we're moving.

1212
01:09:21,730 --> 01:09:23,870
That's g... that's good news.

1213
01:09:23,930 --> 01:09:25,140
Oh, it is hot in here.

1214
01:09:25,210 --> 01:09:27,000
Yeah, that nitro we flushed out

1215
01:09:27,070 --> 01:09:29,720
of the cooling system,
it-it's causing things

1216
01:09:29,780 --> 01:09:30,690
just to heat up a little.

1217
01:09:30,750 --> 01:09:31,480
I'm going to go back

1218
01:09:31,550 --> 01:09:32,590
and just make
some adjustments.

1219
01:09:32,670 --> 01:09:34,130
I'll lend you a hand.

1220
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:35,510
All right.
I'm fine.

1221
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:37,850
I'm going to check
your heartbeat, okay?

1222
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:40,190
Thanks, Braz. Appreciate it.

1223
01:09:40,260 --> 01:09:42,190
So, that's the bad news?

1224
01:09:42,270 --> 01:09:44,160
That's not too bad.

1225
01:09:44,260 --> 01:09:46,590
No.

1226
01:09:46,650 --> 01:09:47,960
Commander lverson died.

1227
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:49,910
But...

1228
01:09:50,010 --> 01:09:52,500
we're living,
and he would want to...

1229
01:09:52,570 --> 01:09:54,940
he'd want us to complete
our mission,

1230
01:09:55,010 --> 01:09:58,100
so I think that it's important
that we all...

1231
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:03,280
It's all right.

1232
01:10:03,420 --> 01:10:05,620
Thank you.

1233
01:10:05,690 --> 01:10:07,830
I'm sorry.

1234
01:10:10,230 --> 01:10:13,720
Let's give him a second, okay?

1235
01:10:13,780 --> 01:10:15,690
He deserves that.

1236
01:10:20,090 --> 01:10:23,120
Oh, God, this all just seems
too big, doesn't it?

1237
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:27,700
I think you were attempting
the impossible.

1238
01:10:27,780 --> 01:10:29,810
You were trying
to save the world, and...

1239
01:10:29,890 --> 01:10:32,300
it's overwhelming.

1240
01:10:32,380 --> 01:10:35,730
I came here to save my wife
and my two children

1241
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:39,900
and... six billion lives...
it's too much.

1242
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:41,850
I just hope
I'm-I'm smart enough

1243
01:10:41,910 --> 01:10:43,860
and brave enough to save three.

1244
01:10:45,020 --> 01:10:48,400
You did a nice job, Joshua.
Very nice. Great.

1245
01:10:48,540 --> 01:10:50,100
You'd have done the same thing.

1246
01:10:50,170 --> 01:10:51,180
Well, maybe, maybe.

1247
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:04,790
Hey... who's steering
the ship?

1248
01:11:04,860 --> 01:11:07,340
Video screen autopilot.

1249
01:11:07,420 --> 01:11:08,850
I hope he knows the way.

1250
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:12,820
You and me both.

1251
01:11:12,890 --> 01:11:16,340
So... you're really
a college professor?

1252
01:11:16,410 --> 01:11:18,550
You're not from the CIA,

1253
01:11:18,610 --> 01:11:22,410
or the NSA or any
of those three-letter places?

1254
01:11:22,490 --> 01:11:25,040
No. I am a boring
college professor.

1255
01:11:25,110 --> 01:11:29,940
Wrong place, wrong place.

1256
01:11:30,010 --> 01:11:33,620
That was the bravest thing
I've ever seen.

1257
01:11:33,690 --> 01:11:35,060
Well, I just, I just...

1258
01:11:35,130 --> 01:11:36,500
Listen, the lack of oxygen

1259
01:11:36,570 --> 01:11:38,910
kept me from weeping
like a little girl

1260
01:11:38,970 --> 01:11:42,420
as is my custom
in dangerous situations.

1261
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:54,070
Hey, guys, we're close
to the mantle core interface.

1262
01:11:54,130 --> 01:11:55,150
Where are you?

1263
01:11:55,230 --> 01:11:57,810
Key's in, Dr. Brazzleton.

1264
01:11:57,880 --> 01:12:00,120
Ready.

1265
01:12:00,190 --> 01:12:01,230
We are in the...

1266
01:12:01,310 --> 01:12:02,740
Okay, the code...
0-1-3-1-9-9-5.

1267
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:04,430
...luxurious, beautiful
weapons control...

1268
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:06,360
checking the controls
on the nukes.

1269
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:08,690
This is the birthday
of my daughter.

1270
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:10,220
0-1-3-1-9-9-5.

1271
01:12:10,290 --> 01:12:11,610
- Ready?
- Yeah.

1272
01:12:11,670 --> 01:12:13,870
Three, two and one...

1273
01:12:15,030 --> 01:12:17,070
Thank you.

1274
01:12:17,140 --> 01:12:18,190
Green. All green.

1275
01:12:18,260 --> 01:12:20,240
Great. So we have
to synchronize

1276
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:21,590
the babies now.

1277
01:12:25,710 --> 01:12:27,800
Just a second.

1278
01:12:27,860 --> 01:12:29,460
There.

1279
01:12:29,530 --> 01:12:31,670
All right,
now let's put them to bed.

1280
01:12:33,530 --> 01:12:35,950
Zimsky, could you please
come up here for a second?

1281
01:12:36,020 --> 01:12:37,200
Yes?

1282
01:12:37,270 --> 01:12:39,640
We're not supposed to go through
anything black.

1283
01:12:39,710 --> 01:12:40,780
Yes, so please don't.

1284
01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:41,820
What is this?

1285
01:12:44,430 --> 01:12:45,820
They're scattered everywhere.

1286
01:12:48,430 --> 01:12:50,890
Oh, my God!
They're diamonds!

1287
01:12:50,970 --> 01:12:53,240
Great.

1288
01:12:53,310 --> 01:12:55,310
You might want to sit down
and buckle up.

1289
01:12:55,390 --> 01:12:57,070
We're on a collision course
here.

1290
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:05,260
All rightie. Careful.

1291
01:13:09,750 --> 01:13:11,440
Guys, we're dodging diamonds
the size of Cape Cod,

1292
01:13:11,510 --> 01:13:13,140
so bear with me.

1293
01:13:13,210 --> 01:13:14,930
Not exactly nimble here.

1294
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,370
Diamonds? I want some.

1295
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:17,390
Can I help?

1296
01:13:39,380 --> 01:13:39,950
Ooh!

1297
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:44,880
Okay.
It's okay.

1298
01:13:46,710 --> 01:13:50,220
Okay, it looks like
we're in the clear.

1299
01:13:55,670 --> 01:13:57,260
Breach!

1300
01:13:57,370 --> 01:13:59,850
Guys! Weapons control, get out!

1301
01:13:59,930 --> 01:14:01,000
Get out now!

1302
01:14:10,900 --> 01:14:12,850
Serge!

1303
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:16,210
Serge! What the hell
are you doing?

1304
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:18,790
Come on!

1305
01:14:18,870 --> 01:14:20,300
My notebook!

1306
01:14:20,430 --> 01:14:21,420
Now!

1307
01:14:24,660 --> 01:14:25,320
Serge!

1308
01:14:32,020 --> 01:14:34,190
Take the time reg, Joshua!

1309
01:14:34,260 --> 01:14:35,760
Come on Serge! Come on!

1310
01:14:35,820 --> 01:14:37,580
My notes!
You'll need them!

1311
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:38,550
No!

1312
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:40,740
God, no, Serge!

1313
01:14:40,820 --> 01:14:42,030
It's okay.

1314
01:14:42,100 --> 01:14:43,850
Serge, come on! No!

1315
01:14:43,930 --> 01:14:44,820
Serge!

1316
01:14:44,890 --> 01:14:46,060
Come on, man!

1317
01:14:46,130 --> 01:14:49,810
- Leave the box!
- We need the box!

1318
01:14:49,870 --> 01:14:51,530
We can get him!
We can get him out!

1319
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:55,560
Hold on, Serge!

1320
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:08,690
Beck! Beck!

1321
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:11,240
Override the ejection system!

1322
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:14,170
Beck, no!
One damaged compartment

1323
01:15:14,220 --> 01:15:15,370
threatens the whole ship!

1324
01:15:16,250 --> 01:15:18,510
Beck! Beck!

1325
01:15:18,580 --> 01:15:22,370
Override the ejection system!

1326
01:15:27,630 --> 01:15:28,850
Serge, we're right here.

1327
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:30,540
We're not going
to forget about you, man.

1328
01:15:30,610 --> 01:15:31,890
- Josh, can you hear me?
- Serge! Serge...

1329
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:33,370
Hey, buddy,
look in your monitor right now.

1330
01:15:33,420 --> 01:15:34,370
Serge, look in your monitor.

1331
01:15:34,450 --> 01:15:36,200
I'm right here. Serge...

1332
01:15:36,270 --> 01:15:39,210
Josh, I can't see you.

1333
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:41,610
Braz is going to override
the doors manually, okay?

1334
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:43,750
We're working on it right now.
Braz, how long?

1335
01:15:43,830 --> 01:15:46,350
Going as fast as I can,
Fast as I can.

1336
01:15:46,420 --> 01:15:48,460
- Okay, I'm scared.
- We're going right now.

1337
01:15:48,530 --> 01:15:49,800
Shouldn't be two seconds,
all right?

1338
01:15:49,870 --> 01:15:50,820
Josh!

1339
01:15:50,900 --> 01:15:53,510
Beck, override
the ejection systems, okay?

1340
01:15:53,580 --> 01:15:56,040
Damn. I don't think
Beck can hear me.

1341
01:15:56,110 --> 01:15:58,060
Serge, look at me now. Serge!

1342
01:15:58,130 --> 01:15:59,720
Serge, we're right here, okay?

1343
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:01,390
We're not going
to forget about you, man.

1344
01:16:01,450 --> 01:16:02,770
I'm going to get you
out of here.

1345
01:16:02,840 --> 01:16:04,070
We're working on it, all right?

1346
01:16:04,150 --> 01:16:07,020
Stay with me here.
Okay?

1347
01:16:07,090 --> 01:16:08,490
I don't know what to do.

1348
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:09,840
Can you hear me now?
All right, here I am.

1349
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:10,920
I'm not going
to let you go, man.

1350
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,360
I'm not going to let you go,
all right?

1351
01:16:13,420 --> 01:16:16,620
Stay with me here, okay?

1352
01:16:16,690 --> 01:16:17,900
I'm going to come to Paris

1353
01:16:17,970 --> 01:16:19,880
and we'll go out, all right?
After this.

1354
01:16:19,950 --> 01:16:22,480
After this is all
said and done, all right?

1355
01:16:22,540 --> 01:16:24,230
- Josh!
- Serge!

1356
01:16:24,310 --> 01:16:26,450
Serge! Serge!

1357
01:16:26,510 --> 01:16:28,880
Serge!

1358
01:16:30,060 --> 01:16:30,990
Serge!

1359
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:23,590
Did you reset the overrides?

1360
01:17:25,930 --> 01:17:27,560
I never pushed them.

1361
01:17:27,630 --> 01:17:30,980
You let him die.

1362
01:17:33,550 --> 01:17:34,800
Actually,
you really want to know?

1363
01:17:34,860 --> 01:17:36,290
I killed him twice.

1364
01:17:36,370 --> 01:17:37,350
First when I hit the diamond,

1365
01:17:37,420 --> 01:17:38,790
and then when I didn't hit
the override.

1366
01:17:38,860 --> 01:17:41,250
Do you want me to feel any worse
about that than I already do?

1367
01:17:41,330 --> 01:17:42,300
It's not possible.

1368
01:17:42,380 --> 01:17:43,630
Why are you being
so smug about that?

1369
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:45,040
Could you have made
the decision?

1370
01:17:45,110 --> 01:17:46,000
- Yes.
- Could you?

1371
01:17:46,060 --> 01:17:47,040
Yes, I could've.

1372
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:48,420
If you would've hit
that switch,

1373
01:17:48,530 --> 01:17:49,800
I could've got him outta there!

1374
01:17:49,870 --> 01:17:50,850
I was yelling for you!

1375
01:17:54,860 --> 01:17:56,520
Take it and look at it!

1376
01:17:56,590 --> 01:17:59,110
I was two inches from him!

1377
01:17:59,180 --> 01:18:00,710
I was two inches,

1378
01:18:00,780 --> 01:18:02,240
and I told you
to put the door up

1379
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:03,210
and you didn't!

1380
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:04,550
I was screaming for you!

1381
01:18:04,620 --> 01:18:07,010
Why didn't you do it?!

1382
01:18:07,090 --> 01:18:09,930
Because I had to make
that decision.

1383
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,590
Fate or God...

1384
01:18:11,660 --> 01:18:12,610
No!

1385
01:18:12,690 --> 01:18:14,440
Damn it!
You leave God out of this!

1386
01:18:14,510 --> 01:18:16,690
Serge died so that we could
complete our job.

1387
01:18:16,750 --> 01:18:18,180
Oh, that's right,
the job of saving the world.

1388
01:18:18,290 --> 01:18:22,510
Not the whole world, Josh!
Just three of them.

1389
01:19:11,150 --> 01:19:13,770
Virgil, you are approaching
core interface.

1390
01:19:13,830 --> 01:19:14,980
Are you good to go?

1391
01:19:15,050 --> 01:19:16,200
Josh?

1392
01:19:16,270 --> 01:19:18,410
Josh, can you hear me?

1393
01:19:20,680 --> 01:19:22,860
Josh, can you hear me?

1394
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:29,700
Ready as we'll ever be, Stick.

1395
01:19:29,770 --> 01:19:32,320
Dr. Keyes.

1396
01:19:33,070 --> 01:19:34,240
Right here.

1397
01:19:37,610 --> 01:19:40,060
Deep Earth,
we are green and good to go.

1398
01:20:17,610 --> 01:20:18,760
We just got a huge speed jump.

1399
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:19,660
We just got a huge speed jump.

1400
01:20:19,730 --> 01:20:20,710
We're at 95 knots.

1401
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:22,810
110.

1402
01:20:22,890 --> 01:20:24,390
130... 140.

1403
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:27,940
Our speed's jumped
because the density of the core

1404
01:20:28,010 --> 01:20:29,410
is different than our estimates.

1405
01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:31,110
It's lighter
than we thought.

1406
01:20:31,180 --> 01:20:32,160
So much for best guesses.

1407
01:20:32,230 --> 01:20:33,180
I'm fine with this.

1408
01:20:33,260 --> 01:20:34,190
At this rate, we'll, what...

1409
01:20:34,250 --> 01:20:36,000
hit the inner core
in a little over five hours.

1410
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:37,350
I think we finally

1411
01:20:37,420 --> 01:20:38,310
bought some luck.

1412
01:20:38,380 --> 01:20:39,270
Braz.

1413
01:20:39,340 --> 01:20:40,290
- Yeah.
- Would you please

1414
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:42,940
punch the new core density
into the equations

1415
01:20:43,020 --> 01:20:44,030
for the nuclear detonation?

1416
01:20:48,870 --> 01:20:50,660
Please tell me this is enough.

1417
01:20:56,170 --> 01:20:56,740
Okay.

1418
01:20:56,810 --> 01:20:58,240
You're telling me

1419
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:00,100
the 1,000 megatons
of nuclear warheads

1420
01:21:00,170 --> 01:21:01,920
we hauled down here
isn't going to cut it?

1421
01:21:01,990 --> 01:21:05,340
No. This core material
is too thin.

1422
01:21:05,410 --> 01:21:06,800
- What?
- The energy waves from

1423
01:21:06,850 --> 01:21:07,910
the explosion
won't spread far enough.

1424
01:21:07,970 --> 01:21:09,320
They'll just bleed
away into nothing.

1425
01:21:14,310 --> 01:21:15,910
That's it.

1426
01:21:15,970 --> 01:21:18,340
We go home.
We go home.

1427
01:21:18,410 --> 01:21:20,230
- Home?
- What?

1428
01:21:20,300 --> 01:21:21,860
Our Commander is dead.

1429
01:21:21,930 --> 01:21:23,390
Our weapons specialist is dead.

1430
01:21:23,460 --> 01:21:25,190
Our weapons control systems
are gone.

1431
01:21:25,260 --> 01:21:27,780
We don't know whether
we can arm the nuclear devices,

1432
01:21:27,850 --> 01:21:30,300
and our plan to fix the core
no longer works. So...

1433
01:21:30,380 --> 01:21:31,310
we have failed.

1434
01:21:31,370 --> 01:21:32,450
We have not failed.

1435
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:34,560
We have failed, and we go home,

1436
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:37,020
and we go to the alternative.

1437
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:37,830
What alternative?

1438
01:21:37,900 --> 01:21:39,310
What are you talking about?

1439
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:41,250
General,
this is Dr. Conrad Zimsky.

1440
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:42,210
Destiny is a go.

1441
01:21:42,280 --> 01:21:43,170
Repeat.

1442
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:44,960
Destiny is a go.

1443
01:21:45,030 --> 01:21:46,110
Damn.

1444
01:21:50,470 --> 01:21:53,570
I need to know everything
to do my job.

1445
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:55,840
You don't have to know this.

1446
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:57,320
General, it is my job

1447
01:21:57,380 --> 01:22:00,000
to ensure the safety
of this mission.

1448
01:22:00,070 --> 01:22:02,340
Anything that affects
it is my business.

1449
01:22:02,410 --> 01:22:04,070
Now what the hell is Destiny?

1450
01:22:04,130 --> 01:22:05,990
It's a device.

1451
01:22:06,050 --> 01:22:11,420
Deep Earth Seismic Trigger
Initiative, DEST-INI. Destiny.

1452
01:22:11,490 --> 01:22:13,220
We had reason to believe

1453
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:15,390
that our enemies were
building a weapon

1454
01:22:15,460 --> 01:22:17,890
that could generate
targeted seismic events.

1455
01:22:19,270 --> 01:22:21,410
They would be able
to create massive earthquakes

1456
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:22,380
under our territory.

1457
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:23,680
No way of telling who did it.

1458
01:22:23,810 --> 01:22:24,860
So?

1459
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:26,620
So... we built one, too.

1460
01:22:27,430 --> 01:22:28,470
M.A.D.

1461
01:22:28,550 --> 01:22:30,050
Mutually Assured Destruction.

1462
01:22:30,110 --> 01:22:32,160
A perfect acronym
if ever there was one.

1463
01:22:32,230 --> 01:22:33,760
Beautiful.

1464
01:22:33,830 --> 01:22:34,730
They built it first.

1465
01:22:34,790 --> 01:22:35,690
I built it better.

1466
01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:37,060
I beamed high-powered

1467
01:22:37,150 --> 01:22:38,720
electromagnetic
energy waves down Deep Earth

1468
01:22:38,790 --> 01:22:40,190
fault lines, and, you know.

1469
01:22:40,260 --> 01:22:41,950
Zimsky, what makes you think

1470
01:22:42,030 --> 01:22:44,220
that Destiny
would even touch the core?

1471
01:22:44,300 --> 01:22:45,820
'Cause it already did.

1472
01:22:47,850 --> 01:22:50,370
This isn't a fluke.

1473
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:51,420
We killed the planet.

1474
01:22:51,490 --> 01:22:53,220
You keep saying
that the core is too big

1475
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:55,140
to be affected by anything
short of nukes.

1476
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:56,220
- So...
- The core is an engine.

1477
01:22:56,300 --> 01:22:57,920
Throw a small wrench
into a big engine,

1478
01:22:57,990 --> 01:22:59,000
you can still stall it.

1479
01:23:02,050 --> 01:23:03,580
Deep Earth, this is Virgil.

1480
01:23:03,650 --> 01:23:08,060
We require clarification on
the status of Project Destiny.

1481
01:23:08,130 --> 01:23:09,660
Why weren't
we notified of this, sir?

1482
01:23:09,730 --> 01:23:11,620
Because you didn't need to know,
Major.

1483
01:23:12,710 --> 01:23:14,330
Now you may not like this.

1484
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:15,620
I may not like it either.

1485
01:23:15,690 --> 01:23:17,690
But it's my job,
and I do it for my country,

1486
01:23:17,770 --> 01:23:20,510
and if we don't develop these
devices, someone worse will

1487
01:23:20,580 --> 01:23:22,170
and they will
use them against us.

1488
01:23:22,250 --> 01:23:23,770
But you have my word.

1489
01:23:23,850 --> 01:23:26,660
No one in this
administration... no one,

1490
01:23:26,730 --> 01:23:29,060
had any idea
that this could happen.

1491
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:31,620
So the device that killed the
planet is your backup plan?

1492
01:23:31,680 --> 01:23:34,140
An electric shock
can stop a heart.

1493
01:23:34,220 --> 01:23:36,290
It can certainly restart one.

1494
01:23:36,350 --> 01:23:37,670
Destiny will work.

1495
01:23:37,730 --> 01:23:38,940
It has to.

1496
01:23:39,010 --> 01:23:39,900
No, it won't work.

1497
01:23:39,970 --> 01:23:41,080
If you fire that thing again

1498
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:43,810
with the core already stalled,
it'll terminally destabilize it.

1499
01:23:43,870 --> 01:23:45,850
Yes, granted... there is
a marginal risk involved,

1500
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:47,070
but given the circumstances,

1501
01:23:47,170 --> 01:23:48,600
I hardly see that there's
an alternative.

1502
01:23:48,680 --> 01:23:49,570
No, Zimsky, listen to me.

1503
01:23:49,640 --> 01:23:51,060
Every volcano
on the planet will blow.

1504
01:23:51,140 --> 01:23:53,630
There'll be earthquakes big
enough to rip us to pieces.

1505
01:23:53,700 --> 01:23:54,590
- Dr. Keyes.
- What?

1506
01:23:54,660 --> 01:23:56,350
I'm afraid it's all we've got.

1507
01:23:56,420 --> 01:23:58,550
Now, I have orders
from the president.

1508
01:23:58,630 --> 01:23:59,640
Come home, Virgil.

1509
01:23:59,720 --> 01:24:00,610
We go to plan B.

1510
01:24:00,670 --> 01:24:01,620
Well, what about plan C?

1511
01:24:02,340 --> 01:24:03,230
What? What?

1512
01:24:03,300 --> 01:24:04,350
Well, plan C.

1513
01:24:04,450 --> 01:24:05,880
We continue on.

1514
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:07,930
We restart the core...
somehow.

1515
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,520
We don't do it,
you fire Destiny.

1516
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:11,930
I can't wait for you
to get out of there.

1517
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,760
Then don't.
We fail, fire Destiny.

1518
01:24:13,830 --> 01:24:15,070
Oh, come on! That's ridiculous!

1519
01:24:15,140 --> 01:24:15,770
What choice do we have,

1520
01:24:15,850 --> 01:24:16,820
- Zimsky?
- Are you kidding me?

1521
01:24:16,930 --> 01:24:18,010
If they set that thing off,

1522
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:19,390
the shock waves
will wipe us out!

1523
01:24:19,460 --> 01:24:21,600
We'll be lucky to get back
if we turn back right now!

1524
01:24:21,670 --> 01:24:24,520
Virgil, I'm telling you
right now, we will fire Destiny,

1525
01:24:24,580 --> 01:24:26,560
and we need to do so
as quickly as possible,

1526
01:24:26,630 --> 01:24:28,010
and if you're still there,

1527
01:24:28,060 --> 01:24:30,010
you will be destroyed.

1528
01:24:30,090 --> 01:24:31,740
Rebecca?

1529
01:24:31,810 --> 01:24:33,950
Please don't make me
have to do this.

1530
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:40,640
Plan C.

1531
01:24:44,190 --> 01:24:45,570
It's your call, Commander.

1532
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:53,540
Majority decision.

1533
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:56,090
We're going in.

1534
01:24:56,160 --> 01:24:57,340
I'm sorry, sir.

1535
01:25:00,160 --> 01:25:02,780
Oh, come on, you're
a bunch of suicidal morons!

1536
01:25:02,850 --> 01:25:03,960
What are you, crazy?

1537
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:05,970
Plan C?
Restart the core "somehow"?

1538
01:25:06,050 --> 01:25:06,940
Oh, that's a great idea!

1539
01:25:07,010 --> 01:25:08,000
That's a brilliant idea!

1540
01:25:08,060 --> 01:25:09,150
I can't believe I'm stuck

1541
01:25:09,220 --> 01:25:11,160
in this floating septic tank
with you lunatics!

1542
01:25:11,240 --> 01:25:12,610
You may have nothing to lose.

1543
01:25:12,680 --> 01:25:13,570
You may have nothing to lose!

1544
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:14,530
You may have nothing to lose

1545
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:15,490
but I have my life to lose,

1546
01:25:15,550 --> 01:25:16,700
thank you very much
while you're up!

1547
01:25:16,770 --> 01:25:17,660
Now turn it around!

1548
01:25:17,730 --> 01:25:19,260
He told us to go back
and we're going back!

1549
01:25:19,330 --> 01:25:21,220
Why? You want to be a hero?
You want to be a martyr?

1550
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:23,030
What do you want to be?
You're out of your mind!

1551
01:25:23,100 --> 01:25:24,760
Thank you!
Turn it around!

1552
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:25,880
- No!
- Zimsky.

1553
01:25:30,850 --> 01:25:32,440
You, shut up!

1554
01:25:37,290 --> 01:25:39,520
It's not a stupid ship.

1555
01:25:41,340 --> 01:25:42,560
I had to.

1556
01:25:45,890 --> 01:25:47,100
It had to happen sometime.

1557
01:25:47,170 --> 01:25:49,080
Yeah.

1558
01:25:54,270 --> 01:25:56,220
Oh...

1559
01:25:56,290 --> 01:25:57,230
Status! What is that?

1560
01:25:57,310 --> 01:25:58,940
It's the EM
monitoring station.

1561
01:25:59,010 --> 01:25:59,900
It's the one that

1562
01:25:59,970 --> 01:26:01,010
tracks EM pulses.

1563
01:26:01,090 --> 01:26:02,430
God, no.

1564
01:26:06,430 --> 01:26:07,480
Just talk, Mr. Rat.

1565
01:26:07,550 --> 01:26:08,440
No.

1566
01:26:08,510 --> 01:26:09,980
That's a good boy.

1567
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:12,500
Remember those
invisible microwaves

1568
01:26:12,580 --> 01:26:14,580
that Josh was talking about?

1569
01:26:14,660 --> 01:26:16,760
Well, they just found a hole.

1570
01:26:55,740 --> 01:26:57,540
No, it's a parking lot
out here...

1571
01:27:11,450 --> 01:27:12,700
Oh, my God.

1572
01:27:44,990 --> 01:27:46,330
And now with this

1573
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:47,740
horrific breaking news,

1574
01:27:47,810 --> 01:27:51,320
we go live to San Francisco,
where Leo Jacks has the story.

1575
01:27:51,390 --> 01:27:53,360
Yes, Claire,
it's hard to believe

1576
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:55,740
that half of San Francisco
is in ruins today

1577
01:27:55,810 --> 01:27:57,970
following the most devastating
and the most baffling

1578
01:27:58,050 --> 01:28:01,490
event in our nation's history.

1579
01:28:01,570 --> 01:28:03,350
It's-it's
a horrific situation here.

1580
01:28:03,420 --> 01:28:04,440
Thousands are dead.

1581
01:28:04,510 --> 01:28:05,560
Many are missing.

1582
01:28:05,630 --> 01:28:07,450
It's-it's hotels, hospitals.

1583
01:28:07,510 --> 01:28:08,670
Bring up the power grid.

1584
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:13,760
The whole West Coast is out.

1585
01:28:15,390 --> 01:28:17,910
That means we're going to have
to suck up just about every drop

1586
01:28:17,980 --> 01:28:19,290
of juice east of the Rockies

1587
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:20,570
to fire Destiny.

1588
01:28:20,630 --> 01:28:24,250
Another EM spike, we're not
going to have enough power.

1589
01:28:24,380 --> 01:28:27,870
General, you have got
to give them more time.

1590
01:28:27,930 --> 01:28:29,140
There is no more time.

1591
01:28:29,210 --> 01:28:30,430
Colonel, call Destiny.

1592
01:28:30,490 --> 01:28:31,860
I am launching
a formal complaint

1593
01:28:31,930 --> 01:28:34,320
against you
with the Department of Defense.

1594
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:35,290
Rat to Josh.

1595
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:36,400
Go, Rat.

1596
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:37,520
Hey, um...

1597
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:40,500
here's the EM Field data
that you're primed for.

1598
01:28:40,570 --> 01:28:42,900
Digging that, Rat.

1599
01:28:42,970 --> 01:28:44,020
Primed for.

1600
01:28:44,090 --> 01:28:45,200
Primed for.

1601
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:47,960
Prime numbers...

1602
01:28:48,020 --> 01:28:50,160
one, two, three, five,

1603
01:28:50,300 --> 01:28:52,210
seven, 11, 13, 17...

1604
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:16,700
Here we go.

1605
01:29:39,100 --> 01:29:40,340
James.

1606
01:29:47,100 --> 01:29:48,350
Yes, sir.

1607
01:29:50,300 --> 01:29:51,510
Yes, sir.

1608
01:29:51,580 --> 01:29:53,500
Here we go, folks.

1609
01:29:53,500 --> 01:29:55,800
Okay, this time
it's going to work.

1610
01:29:55,860 --> 01:29:58,140
Here you go... beautiful.
Yeah, mm-hmm.

1611
01:29:58,200 --> 01:29:59,100
Come on, baby.

1612
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:01,970
Come on, Daddy wants to see
the sky again.

1613
01:30:03,860 --> 01:30:06,290
Okay, okay, okay.
Let's try again.

1614
01:30:06,370 --> 01:30:07,510
Your torque is R,

1615
01:30:07,570 --> 01:30:08,980
cross F...

1616
01:30:09,050 --> 01:30:11,220
No, your R is too small, Josh.

1617
01:30:11,290 --> 01:30:12,220
Right.

1618
01:30:12,280 --> 01:30:13,170
Wait, hold on.

1619
01:30:13,240 --> 01:30:14,450
What are you laughing at?

1620
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:17,680
No, I mean, it took me and 400
of the world's smartest people

1621
01:30:17,750 --> 01:30:19,350
to come up with the first plan.

1622
01:30:19,420 --> 01:30:20,460
You want to help?

1623
01:30:20,540 --> 01:30:22,610
No. I want to turn around
and go home.

1624
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:24,060
It's not going to happen.

1625
01:30:24,160 --> 01:30:25,780
Well, then we're going to die.

1626
01:30:27,100 --> 01:30:27,900
True.

1627
01:30:27,990 --> 01:30:28,980
All right, look,

1628
01:30:29,050 --> 01:30:30,060
- let's start from square one.
- Okay.

1629
01:30:30,140 --> 01:30:31,030
Let's start from square one.

1630
01:30:31,100 --> 01:30:33,990
The bulk modules...
depends on density.

1631
01:30:34,070 --> 01:30:35,930
Your torque is R cross F,

1632
01:30:35,990 --> 01:30:38,650
but you have
to integrate volume...

1633
01:30:38,710 --> 01:30:42,490
But here, here...
just consider this.

1634
01:30:45,940 --> 01:30:47,260
Now, we got this...

1635
01:30:47,330 --> 01:30:48,780
Okay, now, R cross F,

1636
01:30:48,860 --> 01:30:51,190
we're putting in pi.
What's V?

1637
01:30:51,260 --> 01:30:53,810
Oh, for God's sake!

1638
01:30:53,910 --> 01:30:55,160
All right.
I'm hitting him again.

1639
01:30:55,230 --> 01:30:56,150
No, no, no!

1640
01:30:56,220 --> 01:30:58,490
Braz, no, look, I have a theory.

1641
01:30:59,450 --> 01:31:00,240
Are you interested?

1642
01:31:00,310 --> 01:31:01,590
Yes. We're interested.

1643
01:31:01,650 --> 01:31:04,410
Then let me smoke a cigarette,
and I'll tell you.

1644
01:31:13,560 --> 01:31:14,420
Oh, thank God.

1645
01:31:15,640 --> 01:31:17,400
Hmm? All right, fine, look.

1646
01:31:17,470 --> 01:31:19,830
Look, we have to use
wave interference, okay?

1647
01:31:19,890 --> 01:31:21,690
Because one explosion
won't do it.

1648
01:31:21,750 --> 01:31:23,250
Think about stones in a pond.

1649
01:31:23,320 --> 01:31:25,140
You drop a large stone
into a pond,

1650
01:31:25,210 --> 01:31:26,320
you get a big splash,

1651
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:27,950
and then that's it, it's over.

1652
01:31:28,030 --> 01:31:31,600
But drop a smaller stone,
wait until the ripples weaken

1653
01:31:31,670 --> 01:31:34,290
and drop another and another,
and another,

1654
01:31:34,360 --> 01:31:36,720
and fluid dynamics 101.

1655
01:31:36,790 --> 01:31:39,250
The ripples reinforce each other
in geometric progression.

1656
01:31:39,320 --> 01:31:41,740
Hm, the whole bigger than
the sum of the parts.

1657
01:31:41,880 --> 01:31:42,930
Then we'll have five

1658
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,200
200 megaton explosions...

1659
01:31:45,270 --> 01:31:46,740
Instead of one big bang.

1660
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:48,720
So, we hot-wire the nukes.

1661
01:31:48,790 --> 01:31:49,680
Yes.

1662
01:31:49,750 --> 01:31:50,650
And as one does,

1663
01:31:50,710 --> 01:31:52,470
we seed them
through the core...

1664
01:31:52,540 --> 01:31:55,390
at locations that have
to be accurate to the inch.

1665
01:31:55,440 --> 01:31:58,350
We detonate them in a sequence
that has to be accurate

1666
01:31:58,430 --> 01:31:59,570
to the millisecond...

1667
01:31:59,630 --> 01:32:03,760
then we outrun the biggest
nuclear shock wave in history.

1668
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:04,780
Right.

1669
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:06,650
Yeah.

1670
01:32:06,710 --> 01:32:10,480
I mean, that should be
fairly simple.

1671
01:32:17,300 --> 01:32:20,050
Destiny now should be
diverting to the central.

1672
01:32:20,120 --> 01:32:21,160
Final calibration

1673
01:32:21,240 --> 01:32:23,250
on both transmission systems...

1674
01:32:28,310 --> 01:32:30,040
Come on.

1675
01:32:30,100 --> 01:32:31,220
Cut the...
cut the rouge.

1676
01:32:31,280 --> 01:32:33,800
The red wire above the circuit.

1677
01:32:33,880 --> 01:32:34,770
Okay. Okay.

1678
01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:35,790
No, no, wait, hold it!

1679
01:32:35,870 --> 01:32:36,980
I'm sorry, cut it below.

1680
01:32:40,540 --> 01:32:42,870
Please...

1681
01:32:47,060 --> 01:32:48,620
Extensions A, B.

1682
01:32:48,700 --> 01:32:49,640
- Here we go.
- F, check.

1683
01:32:49,710 --> 01:32:51,760
Increase power to reactors
ten through 15

1684
01:32:51,860 --> 01:32:53,800
We're almost there, folks.

1685
01:33:43,450 --> 01:33:46,090
Okay, guys we're closing
on the inner core.

1686
01:33:46,160 --> 01:33:48,340
The nukes are ready.
Timers are on.

1687
01:33:48,460 --> 01:33:51,120
Great.
Let's start dropping them.

1688
01:33:51,190 --> 01:33:53,580
No. The bombs are not built
for these pressures.

1689
01:33:53,650 --> 01:33:55,270
That's why they were
in that pod.

1690
01:33:55,350 --> 01:33:56,560
If you send them out now...

1691
01:33:56,620 --> 01:33:58,380
out of that casing,
they'll be crushed instantly.

1692
01:33:58,450 --> 01:33:59,430
I'm assuming we have a Plan D.

1693
01:33:59,510 --> 01:34:00,840
Plan D is
Virgil's compartments.

1694
01:34:00,910 --> 01:34:01,810
We put a nuke in

1695
01:34:01,870 --> 01:34:02,930
each section of Virgil,

1696
01:34:02,990 --> 01:34:04,900
and then eject the individual
sections one at a time.

1697
01:34:04,980 --> 01:34:07,180
They should stay intact long
enough for the nuke to go off.

1698
01:34:07,250 --> 01:34:08,300
Oh...

1699
01:34:08,370 --> 01:34:10,640
What?

1700
01:34:10,700 --> 01:34:14,450
Virgil's not designed to eject
undamaged compartments.

1701
01:34:14,510 --> 01:34:16,690
Okay, these are
the ejection mechanisms

1702
01:34:16,750 --> 01:34:18,640
holding each compartment
in place.

1703
01:34:18,710 --> 01:34:21,670
They're all connected
by one master hydraulic gear.

1704
01:34:21,750 --> 01:34:24,430
Kind of like keys
on a key ring.

1705
01:34:24,500 --> 01:34:27,180
What we have to do, we have
to unlock the piston.

1706
01:34:27,250 --> 01:34:29,160
That will release
the compartments

1707
01:34:29,230 --> 01:34:30,700
so the bombs can be jettisoned.

1708
01:34:30,770 --> 01:34:32,010
Where's the master gear?

1709
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:34,760
In the crawl space
we used to get out earlier.

1710
01:34:34,830 --> 01:34:36,010
Well, what the hell
is it doing there?

1711
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:37,460
I built the ship
in three damn months.

1712
01:34:37,530 --> 01:34:38,530
I didn't think I'd be

1713
01:34:38,610 --> 01:34:40,200
intentionally sabotaging it.
I'm sorry!

1714
01:34:40,270 --> 01:34:41,420
So one of us has to go in there.

1715
01:34:41,490 --> 01:34:42,900
Correct.

1716
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:44,850
Into the crawl space that has
core fluid at 9,000 degrees.

1717
01:34:44,910 --> 01:34:45,840
Yes.

1718
01:34:45,910 --> 01:34:47,310
Can you flush it
with liquid nitrogen?

1719
01:34:47,380 --> 01:34:48,840
We don't have enough
at this point.

1720
01:34:48,910 --> 01:34:49,970
9,000 degrees.

1721
01:34:50,030 --> 01:34:51,920
And our suits are built
to withstand...?

1722
01:34:51,990 --> 01:34:53,480
Half that, probably.

1723
01:34:53,550 --> 01:34:54,480
Right. Half that.

1724
01:34:54,550 --> 01:34:55,850
So what you're saying is

1725
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:57,990
whoever goes into that crawl
space, is not coming back.

1726
01:34:59,990 --> 01:35:01,880
Hmm.

1727
01:35:06,740 --> 01:35:08,940
Together.

1728
01:35:09,010 --> 01:35:10,220
Yes, thank you.

1729
01:35:10,290 --> 01:35:11,720
Wait.

1730
01:35:11,820 --> 01:35:13,480
- On three.
- Okay.

1731
01:35:13,560 --> 01:35:16,040
One... two... three.

1732
01:35:24,460 --> 01:35:27,080
Huh.

1733
01:35:27,210 --> 01:35:32,450
Well, I better go on,
get myself ready.

1734
01:35:32,530 --> 01:35:33,570
No, Braz, wait.

1735
01:35:33,650 --> 01:35:35,110
No, Braz, no wait.
Excuse me.

1736
01:35:35,180 --> 01:35:36,680
Just a moment, may I see that?

1737
01:35:36,780 --> 01:35:37,650
- No.
- May I?

1738
01:35:37,770 --> 01:35:38,610
May I?

1739
01:35:38,740 --> 01:35:39,810
Yes.

1740
01:35:39,890 --> 01:35:41,650
Thank you.

1741
01:35:41,710 --> 01:35:44,170
Magic.

1742
01:35:44,240 --> 01:35:48,200
I mean, Braz, three straws
of equal length.

1743
01:35:48,270 --> 01:35:49,840
I mean, this is childish.

1744
01:35:49,900 --> 01:35:51,080
Let's do it again.

1745
01:35:51,150 --> 01:35:52,940
No, we will not do it again.

1746
01:35:53,010 --> 01:35:54,630
I thought you'd be happy.

1747
01:35:54,710 --> 01:35:55,600
No. Not at the expense

1748
01:35:55,670 --> 01:35:57,010
of you making us
look like fools.

1749
01:35:57,070 --> 01:35:59,210
He's right. Why do you get dibs
on being the hero?

1750
01:35:59,280 --> 01:36:00,650
Because it's my damn ship.

1751
01:36:00,720 --> 01:36:02,150
Oh, that makes perfect sense.

1752
01:36:02,230 --> 01:36:05,640
Look, for 20 years, I've done
nothing but Virgil. 20 years.

1753
01:36:05,710 --> 01:36:06,980
Virgil belongs to me,

1754
01:36:07,060 --> 01:36:08,680
and I will not let her fail.

1755
01:36:08,750 --> 01:36:09,970
I will not.

1756
01:36:10,030 --> 01:36:12,130
Now if you want to know
what's worth dying for...

1757
01:36:12,210 --> 01:36:13,100
this ship.

1758
01:36:13,170 --> 01:36:16,040
Building it
instead of imagining it.

1759
01:36:16,110 --> 01:36:20,170
If Virgil needs more blood,
it will be my blood.

1760
01:36:20,240 --> 01:36:22,280
Now I am going to go

1761
01:36:22,350 --> 01:36:23,590
and get ready.

1762
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,170
Good to go.

1763
01:36:40,820 --> 01:36:42,250
Beck.

1764
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:43,810
Josh.

1765
01:36:46,830 --> 01:36:49,310
It's a hell of a boat
you built, Braz.

1766
01:36:49,390 --> 01:36:53,520
I am really proud to
have known you guys.

1767
01:36:53,580 --> 01:36:55,490
Thank you.

1768
01:37:15,280 --> 01:37:16,680
Braz.

1769
01:37:16,750 --> 01:37:18,790
Edward.

1770
01:37:18,860 --> 01:37:22,570
Yes, Conrad?

1771
01:37:22,640 --> 01:37:24,100
You're right.

1772
01:37:24,170 --> 01:37:25,860
It is your ship.

1773
01:37:25,930 --> 01:37:29,640
But I wish to God
it had been ours.

1774
01:37:51,470 --> 01:37:54,770
The chamber's sealed, Beck.

1775
01:37:54,820 --> 01:37:56,690
Ready.

1776
01:37:58,290 --> 01:38:01,140
Open the hatch.

1777
01:38:38,380 --> 01:38:39,910
Hang on, Braz.

1778
01:38:39,980 --> 01:38:41,890
Come on, hang on.

1779
01:39:33,070 --> 01:39:35,070
Manual override is complete!

1780
01:39:35,150 --> 01:39:36,520
Braz, we can still
get you out of there.

1781
01:39:40,870 --> 01:39:43,650
No... start...
start the impeller.

1782
01:39:46,640 --> 01:39:47,940
No.

1783
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:16,510
We got a job to do.

1784
01:40:16,590 --> 01:40:17,660
Let's do it.

1785
01:40:17,740 --> 01:40:19,630
Let's go.

1786
01:40:21,930 --> 01:40:22,020
Magnetic shielding systems
are up.

1787
01:40:22,020 --> 01:40:24,070
Magnetic shielding systems
are up.

1788
01:40:24,130 --> 01:40:25,220
Power level's 85%.

1789
01:40:25,280 --> 01:40:27,080
Increase power to Reactor 10.

1790
01:40:27,150 --> 01:40:29,150
All personnel should be clear.

1791
01:40:44,390 --> 01:40:45,860
Oh, God!

1792
01:40:45,930 --> 01:40:46,870
Oh, I'm sorry.

1793
01:40:50,820 --> 01:40:52,800
Okay, she's down.

1794
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:55,550
Approaching the first
drop-off point.

1795
01:40:55,630 --> 01:40:57,340
We got to be accurate
to the second here, boys.

1796
01:40:59,340 --> 01:41:01,760
And drop in three-five seconds.

1797
01:41:01,830 --> 01:41:04,800
And... timer on.

1798
01:41:04,870 --> 01:41:06,330
Pull it.

1799
01:41:09,830 --> 01:41:12,350
Clear... and...

1800
01:41:12,460 --> 01:41:13,950
ejecting.

1801
01:41:20,290 --> 01:41:23,140
All right.
Initiate firing sequence.

1802
01:41:23,210 --> 01:41:24,450
Sir...

1803
01:41:24,520 --> 01:41:26,880
It's our last shot, Stick.

1804
01:41:26,950 --> 01:41:28,060
Damn you.

1805
01:41:28,140 --> 01:41:30,470
Damn me? Too late.

1806
01:41:30,540 --> 01:41:33,800
Ten, nine, eight...

1807
01:41:35,240 --> 01:41:37,180
What's that?

1808
01:41:40,390 --> 01:41:42,470
Gotcha!

1809
01:41:42,530 --> 01:41:44,290
...four, three, two...

1810
01:41:44,360 --> 01:41:45,700
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1811
01:41:45,770 --> 01:41:48,190
Someone's diverted our energy.

1812
01:41:48,260 --> 01:41:50,400
Where the hell's it gone?!

1813
01:41:50,470 --> 01:41:53,050
It looks like...

1814
01:41:53,130 --> 01:41:54,680
Coney Island.

1815
01:41:57,030 --> 01:42:00,060
Your Kung Fu is not strong.

1816
01:42:00,130 --> 01:42:02,750
Well, how long will it take
to get it back online?

1817
01:42:02,830 --> 01:42:04,480
Well, then get to it!

1818
01:42:12,140 --> 01:42:13,120
Oh, hey, General.

1819
01:42:13,190 --> 01:42:15,460
Is there something
I can do for you?

1820
01:42:20,100 --> 01:42:21,960
Timer on.

1821
01:42:22,030 --> 01:42:23,810
Clear...

1822
01:42:23,880 --> 01:42:24,810
ejecting.

1823
01:42:32,070 --> 01:42:33,000
Ejecting.

1824
01:42:36,130 --> 01:42:38,370
Pull it.

1825
01:42:38,430 --> 01:42:39,590
All right.

1826
01:42:39,720 --> 01:42:42,200
Let's go throw our last little
200 megaton stone in the pond.

1827
01:42:42,280 --> 01:42:44,380
I always wanted to make a splash
in nuclear physics.

1828
01:42:44,460 --> 01:42:46,010
You know, that energy
propagation stuff

1829
01:42:46,090 --> 01:42:47,160
you were talking about...

1830
01:42:47,240 --> 01:42:48,540
Oh, that was
high school physics.

1831
01:42:48,610 --> 01:42:49,660
Yeah, it's not exactly...

1832
01:42:49,730 --> 01:42:51,590
I just took the wavelengths
from the core fluid

1833
01:42:51,650 --> 01:42:52,700
off the MRI readings.

1834
01:42:52,770 --> 01:42:54,140
Yeah, and multiplied by 800...

1835
01:42:54,210 --> 01:42:55,420
600.

1836
01:42:55,500 --> 01:42:58,430
Surely you compensated
for the MRI bias.

1837
01:42:58,500 --> 01:42:59,770
We got to reset the timers!

1838
01:43:01,730 --> 01:43:03,360
Reset the timers!
No! It just won't work.

1839
01:43:03,430 --> 01:43:05,180
It's not the timers!
This is not enough!

1840
01:43:05,250 --> 01:43:06,150
What's not enough?

1841
01:43:06,220 --> 01:43:07,330
The last bomb is
not enough.

1842
01:43:07,400 --> 01:43:08,540
To complete the wave form.

1843
01:43:08,610 --> 01:43:10,650
Yeah. No. The last bomb
has to be 30% larger.

1844
01:43:10,720 --> 01:43:12,150
That's six or seven pounds
of plutonium.

1845
01:43:12,230 --> 01:43:14,460
Where are we going to get six
or seven pounds of plutonium?

1846
01:43:20,770 --> 01:43:23,190
Guys, we got hit

1847
01:43:23,270 --> 01:43:24,160
by an energy flare.

1848
01:43:24,230 --> 01:43:25,540
I can't keep us on course.

1849
01:43:25,610 --> 01:43:27,360
Ejecting compartment
in 50 seconds.

1850
01:43:27,430 --> 01:43:28,860
No, Beck! No, wait!
No! Push it!

1851
01:43:28,940 --> 01:43:30,870
You push it!

1852
01:43:30,950 --> 01:43:32,540
Come on, guys, I can't hear you.

1853
01:43:34,620 --> 01:43:36,250
It's got my shoulder!

1854
01:43:36,320 --> 01:43:37,220
Push!

1855
01:43:37,280 --> 01:43:38,180
Guys!

1856
01:43:38,250 --> 01:43:39,230
Clear!

1857
01:43:39,300 --> 01:43:40,860
Clear the compartment!
What are you doing?

1858
01:43:40,930 --> 01:43:42,460
I think the flare
has knocked the Coms out.

1859
01:43:42,530 --> 01:43:43,840
I can't get it, Josh.
I can't get it.

1860
01:43:43,930 --> 01:43:45,150
Go...

1861
01:43:45,220 --> 01:43:46,810
I can't.

1862
01:43:46,880 --> 01:43:47,810
Okay.

1863
01:43:47,880 --> 01:43:50,400
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1864
01:43:50,470 --> 01:43:52,370
Can you hear me?

1865
01:43:52,450 --> 01:43:54,430
I'm correcting course. Now!

1866
01:44:00,420 --> 01:44:01,180
Zimsky!

1867
01:44:02,790 --> 01:44:03,930
No!

1868
01:44:07,870 --> 01:44:09,440
Push it!

1869
01:44:11,080 --> 01:44:13,150
Ejecting compartment
in ten seconds.

1870
01:44:13,220 --> 01:44:14,560
Can you hear me?

1871
01:44:14,660 --> 01:44:16,480
Josh, go! Go! Go!

1872
01:44:16,550 --> 01:44:18,140
Get out! Get out!

1873
01:44:18,210 --> 01:44:21,600
Now! Get out!
Now! Get out! Go!

1874
01:44:32,900 --> 01:44:34,870
Josh.

1875
01:44:34,940 --> 01:44:37,850
For the last bomb,
to make it larger...

1876
01:44:37,920 --> 01:44:40,570
use the fuel rods
from the react...

1877
01:44:41,670 --> 01:44:43,810
Ejecting.

1878
01:44:48,040 --> 01:44:50,970
I got to get...

1879
01:44:51,040 --> 01:44:53,080
I got to...

1880
01:44:53,160 --> 01:44:56,050
Beck.

1881
01:44:56,130 --> 01:44:57,210
Beck, can you hear me?

1882
01:44:57,280 --> 01:44:59,930
Beck, if you have any better
ideas, you tell me now.

1883
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,420
We've only got three minutes
to eject this one.

1884
01:45:02,500 --> 01:45:04,800
Beck!

1885
01:45:04,870 --> 01:45:07,900
Come on, guys.
I can't hear you.

1886
01:45:09,890 --> 01:45:12,100
Beck.

1887
01:46:52,570 --> 01:46:55,350
Josh, come on.

1888
01:46:57,440 --> 01:46:58,750
Are you okay?

1889
01:47:00,860 --> 01:47:01,970
Are you okay?

1890
01:47:02,050 --> 01:47:03,570
Will you take my gloves off?

1891
01:47:03,650 --> 01:47:04,890
Oh, my God.

1892
01:47:04,950 --> 01:47:08,160
Please.

1893
01:47:08,220 --> 01:47:10,300
I had to build the blast.

1894
01:47:10,360 --> 01:47:11,410
I'm sorry.

1895
01:47:11,480 --> 01:47:12,980
Hold on, let me get...

1896
01:47:13,120 --> 01:47:15,670
No. Stay here for one second.

1897
01:47:15,740 --> 01:47:18,040
I was trying to call you.

1898
01:47:18,110 --> 01:47:20,500
I know the Coms were down.

1899
01:47:20,580 --> 01:47:21,470
Right.

1900
01:47:21,540 --> 01:47:22,990
I know what you did.

1901
01:47:23,070 --> 01:47:25,300
We don't have enough energy...

1902
01:47:25,370 --> 01:47:26,260
I know.

1903
01:47:26,330 --> 01:47:27,640
...to get back.

1904
01:47:27,710 --> 01:47:29,080
You did good.

1905
01:47:29,150 --> 01:47:33,040
I would've done the same thing.

1906
01:47:33,120 --> 01:47:34,740
Where's Zimsky?

1907
01:47:36,890 --> 01:47:38,680
Come here.

1908
01:47:38,750 --> 01:47:41,170
You did good.

1909
01:47:42,530 --> 01:47:44,380
You did good.

1910
01:47:57,310 --> 01:48:00,060
One minute
to the first detonation.

1911
01:48:00,130 --> 01:48:02,610
And 12 until the blast hits us.

1912
01:48:05,690 --> 01:48:10,260
I was hoping we'd suffocate
to death first.

1913
01:48:43,550 --> 01:48:45,400
Beck.

1914
01:48:45,470 --> 01:48:47,880
Beck, Beck.

1915
01:48:48,030 --> 01:48:49,070
What could you do

1916
01:48:49,150 --> 01:48:51,610
if I got you enough power
to fire the impeller?

1917
01:48:51,670 --> 01:48:53,740
Maybe not the laser
but the impeller.

1918
01:48:53,820 --> 01:48:55,130
What? From where?

1919
01:48:55,190 --> 01:48:56,990
The heat of the core.

1920
01:48:57,050 --> 01:48:58,710
It's 9,000 degrees.

1921
01:48:58,780 --> 01:49:00,780
Unobtainium converts heat
to energy.

1922
01:49:00,860 --> 01:49:03,990
So this whole damn ship is like
a big, old solar panel.

1923
01:49:04,050 --> 01:49:05,620
Come on, I need your help.

1924
01:49:12,860 --> 01:49:14,270
Number two's going!

1925
01:49:14,330 --> 01:49:16,570
Come on, come on.

1926
01:49:33,850 --> 01:49:37,240
For here in the great infinite
unknowable...

1927
01:49:37,300 --> 01:49:41,580
man can come to know the
most important thing of all:

1928
01:49:41,690 --> 01:49:44,560
Himself.

1929
01:49:44,630 --> 01:49:46,260
He can understand...

1930
01:49:48,120 --> 01:49:50,390
What the fuck am I doing?

1931
01:50:26,140 --> 01:50:28,210
We've got full rotation!

1932
01:50:28,280 --> 01:50:29,290
It's turning!

1933
01:50:37,720 --> 01:50:39,980
All right!

1934
01:50:47,420 --> 01:50:49,140
Come on, Beck, where is it?

1935
01:50:50,740 --> 01:50:52,500
Come on.
Come on, hurry up.

1936
01:50:52,570 --> 01:50:54,000
Is that the last one?

1937
01:50:54,070 --> 01:50:56,210
Yeah.

1938
01:51:03,100 --> 01:51:06,060
Give it a couple seconds.

1939
01:51:14,260 --> 01:51:16,300
It worked!

1940
01:51:27,540 --> 01:51:31,020
Get ready to pull a few G's.

1941
01:51:48,370 --> 01:51:49,750
420 knots.

1942
01:51:49,810 --> 01:51:51,060
Now, this is more like it.

1943
01:51:51,120 --> 01:51:51,850
440.

1944
01:51:59,290 --> 01:52:01,620
So, Rat, what's the center
of this quake?

1945
01:52:01,720 --> 01:52:02,700
It's everywhere!

1946
01:52:02,780 --> 01:52:04,050
It's one giant shock wave!

1947
01:52:04,120 --> 01:52:05,900
The planet's healing itself.

1948
01:52:07,450 --> 01:52:09,380
At this speed,
we're going to be home

1949
01:52:09,460 --> 01:52:11,670
in a third of the time.

1950
01:52:40,820 --> 01:52:42,730
As long as we can surf

1951
01:52:42,810 --> 01:52:44,180
these magma flows,
we'll be okay.

1952
01:52:44,240 --> 01:52:46,550
Let's just pray we don't run
into any dead ends,

1953
01:52:46,610 --> 01:52:49,230
or we're going to miss
those lasers.

1954
01:52:51,860 --> 01:52:54,510
Okay, navigator, which way?

1955
01:52:54,580 --> 01:52:56,010
We've got greater
fluid density on the left.

1956
01:52:56,090 --> 01:52:57,680
Go with the flow.

1957
01:52:57,750 --> 01:52:58,950
Uh-huh.

1958
01:53:19,730 --> 01:53:20,950
Bill, where are they headed?

1959
01:53:21,010 --> 01:53:23,020
Looks like she found
a space between

1960
01:53:23,090 --> 01:53:25,130
some tectonic plates
somewhere near Hawaii.

1961
01:53:29,650 --> 01:53:30,600
Josh...

1962
01:53:30,680 --> 01:53:32,330
Yeah?

1963
01:53:32,410 --> 01:53:33,130
They're closing in
on us too fast.

1964
01:53:33,200 --> 01:53:34,790
I don't know if I can...

1965
01:53:34,870 --> 01:53:36,010
Hey, you got it.

1966
01:53:50,510 --> 01:53:55,920
Um... w-we lost them, Stick,
and I...

1967
01:54:15,890 --> 01:54:17,750
Where'd our power go?

1968
01:54:17,810 --> 01:54:20,740
Well, we're powered by the heat.

1969
01:54:20,820 --> 01:54:23,200
It's stone cold down here.

1970
01:54:25,680 --> 01:54:27,340
Well...

1971
01:54:27,400 --> 01:54:30,220
Look on the bright side.

1972
01:54:30,290 --> 01:54:31,400
At least we're not

1973
01:54:31,470 --> 01:54:32,620
going to boil to death.

1974
01:54:32,690 --> 01:54:34,440
You always look
on the bright side?

1975
01:54:34,510 --> 01:54:36,580
Always.

1976
01:54:37,970 --> 01:54:39,210
Okay, let's assess:

1977
01:54:42,130 --> 01:54:44,620
We've got no communications,

1978
01:54:44,690 --> 01:54:46,100
we're probably 800 feet down,

1979
01:54:46,160 --> 01:54:47,820
but we might as well
be 800 miles.

1980
01:54:47,890 --> 01:54:51,190
We're in an Unobtainium

1981
01:54:51,250 --> 01:54:53,770
cigar tube with the sonar
signature of a rock.

1982
01:54:53,840 --> 01:54:56,970
We've got just enough power
to make the ultrasonics burp,

1983
01:54:57,040 --> 01:54:58,290
but no one's listening

1984
01:54:58,350 --> 01:55:00,630
on those frequencies anyway,
and...

1985
01:55:00,690 --> 01:55:02,570
nobody even knows we're alive.

1986
01:55:08,360 --> 01:55:10,540
Okay.

1987
01:55:10,610 --> 01:55:12,680
Give me a minute on this one.

1988
01:55:28,210 --> 01:55:29,480
This is hopeless.

1989
01:55:29,550 --> 01:55:32,040
Come on, General,
we've got to be getting close.

1990
01:55:32,110 --> 01:55:33,190
We can't...

1991
01:55:33,260 --> 01:55:35,210
Mr. Rat, even if
they were still alive,

1992
01:55:35,280 --> 01:55:36,450
there's no way
they could contact us.

1993
01:55:36,560 --> 01:55:38,150
Bridge.

1994
01:55:39,600 --> 01:55:42,220
Skipper, Combat relays that our
sub has something on the sonar.

1995
01:55:42,280 --> 01:55:43,880
Where do they think?

1996
01:55:43,950 --> 01:55:46,280
Bill, put it up
on the hydrophone.

1997
01:55:49,320 --> 01:55:50,980
Whales, sir.

1998
01:55:51,060 --> 01:55:52,680
They're a long way off
their usual path,

1999
01:55:52,750 --> 01:55:54,410
but that's not uncommon
since that, uh...

2000
01:55:54,480 --> 01:55:55,620
what are they calling it?

2001
01:55:55,690 --> 01:55:56,590
Orbital wobble?

2002
01:55:56,650 --> 01:55:58,250
Yeah, that's what they call it.

2003
01:55:58,320 --> 01:56:00,070
Well, thank you
very much, Captain,

2004
01:56:00,140 --> 01:56:01,610
but I think we're done here.

2005
01:56:01,680 --> 01:56:03,370
General.

2006
01:56:07,060 --> 01:56:08,740
J.O., this is the captain.

2007
01:56:08,810 --> 01:56:10,990
Stand down from SAR Operations.

2008
01:56:41,290 --> 01:56:44,110
It's whales! It's whales!

2009
01:56:44,170 --> 01:56:46,240
Hey! General!

2010
01:56:46,320 --> 01:56:47,940
Stick!

2011
01:56:48,020 --> 01:56:49,130
It's whales!

2012
01:56:49,200 --> 01:56:50,850
The ultrasonics!

2013
01:56:50,920 --> 01:56:52,550
They're singing to them!

2014
01:56:52,620 --> 01:56:54,440
You gotta find the whales!

2015
01:57:12,050 --> 01:57:14,560
Alpha X Ray, this is
November Echo six one zero.

2016
01:57:14,640 --> 01:57:15,720
I'm changing...

2017
01:57:15,790 --> 01:57:18,090
Hold on, I'm seeing
those whales now.

2018
01:57:18,160 --> 01:57:19,430
Whoa!

2019
01:57:19,500 --> 01:57:20,960
Okay, ball's in the water.

2020
01:57:21,030 --> 01:57:23,650
This is neat. Those whales
are circling something.

2021
01:57:23,730 --> 01:57:24,800
Hold on, hold on.

2022
01:57:24,880 --> 01:57:26,160
We have a strong echo here.

2023
01:57:26,220 --> 01:57:27,110
Depth, 800 feet.

2024
01:57:27,180 --> 01:57:28,740
There-there's something
down there.

2025
01:57:28,810 --> 01:57:30,610
There's definitely
something down there.

2026
01:58:11,850 --> 01:58:14,340
I told you pulsing the
ultrasonics would work.

2027
01:58:14,410 --> 01:58:17,540
Do you ever get tired
of being right?

2028
01:58:17,610 --> 01:58:18,540
Yes.

2029
01:58:20,490 --> 01:58:22,660
So what's next for you?

2030
01:58:22,730 --> 01:58:24,550
A shower.

2031
01:58:26,250 --> 01:58:29,380
Then back to NASA, I guess.

2032
01:58:29,450 --> 01:58:30,530
You?

2033
01:58:30,600 --> 01:58:34,050
Deep-dish pepperoni pizza,
green peppers, onions,

2034
01:58:34,120 --> 01:58:39,630
extra mushrooms... then a shower
and then back to the classroom.

2035
01:58:39,690 --> 01:58:45,190
NASA could use
a few good men, you know.

2036
01:58:45,260 --> 01:58:46,470
Yeah.

2037
01:58:46,540 --> 01:58:49,770
Unfortunately, so could my
freshmen geophysics students.

2038
01:58:53,450 --> 01:58:54,150
You know what makes me
really, really angry?

2039
01:58:54,150 --> 01:58:58,120
You know what makes me
really, really angry?

2040
01:58:58,180 --> 01:59:01,630
Bob, Serge, Braz, Zimsky...

2041
01:59:01,700 --> 01:59:04,550
no one's going to ever know
what they did or why they died.

2042
01:59:07,150 --> 01:59:09,960
Unless...

2043
01:59:10,030 --> 01:59:11,780
it all got out somehow.

2044
01:59:14,700 --> 01:59:17,310
That's unthinkable.

2045
01:59:17,380 --> 01:59:18,630
Yeah.

2046
01:59:52,590 --> 01:59:54,780
Okay, here we go.

2047
02:00:03,720 --> 02:00:04,970
Sweet.

2048
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:21,130
It is now emerging that
the world owes its survival

2049
02:00:21,190 --> 02:00:24,130
to the heroism of six
remarkable individuals...

2050
02:00:24,200 --> 02:00:25,830
Shuttle Commander
Robert lverson...

2051
02:00:25,890 --> 02:00:27,140
This extraordinary craft...

2052
02:00:27,210 --> 02:00:28,550
French Scientist, Dr. Serge...

2053
02:00:28,620 --> 02:00:30,950
was captained by NASA astronaut
Dr. Bob lverson.

2054
02:00:31,020 --> 02:00:32,470
Edward Brazzleton
is a name so...

2055
02:00:32,550 --> 02:00:34,690
Dr. Conrad Zimsky
will be best remembered...

2056
02:00:34,790 --> 02:00:35,810
On Capitol Hill today,

2057
02:00:35,880 --> 02:00:37,570
everyone's asking
the same question...

2058
02:00:37,640 --> 02:00:39,780
What is Project Destiny?

2059
02:00:42,120 --> 02:00:44,290
Destiny, meet world.

2060
02:00:44,360 --> 02:00:47,200
World, meet Destiny.

2061
02:00:48,200 --> 02:00:58,200
