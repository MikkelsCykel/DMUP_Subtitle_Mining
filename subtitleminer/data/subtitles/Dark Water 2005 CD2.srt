1
00:00:00,082 --> 00:00:01,582
number in case of an emergency.

2
00:00:02,083 --> 00:00:07,880
He was with Cecilia for a few minutes.
He said hi, he looked at the room.

3
00:00:09,007 --> 00:00:11,676
Is there some problem?
Is he not allowed to?

4
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,761
Is there some restraining order
against him?

5
00:00:13,845 --> 00:00:17,265
No. No.

6
00:00:17,348 --> 00:00:20,893
I was just... wondering if Ceci was...

7
00:00:20,977 --> 00:00:23,479
Still imagining things?

8
00:00:23,563 --> 00:00:27,942
Actually, I'm glad you brought that up.
Her imaginary friend hasn't gone away.

9
00:00:28,026 --> 00:00:31,529
In fact, she threw somewhat of a tantrum
during circle time

10
00:00:31,612 --> 00:00:33,865
when we wouldn't let her "friend"
sing along.

11
00:00:33,948 --> 00:00:36,492
I had to have her take a time-out.

12
00:00:36,576 --> 00:00:41,789
I'm sorry. I'll certainly
talk to Ceci about that.

13
00:00:41,873 --> 00:00:44,959
You know, the PTA provides
a psychologist, Katie Shoettle.

14
00:00:45,043 --> 00:00:49,213
She's very nice. She comes every
Wednesday. It's absolutely no charge.

15
00:00:49,297 --> 00:00:53,509
I'll talk to Ceci about it. It'll stop.
I'm really sorry about that.

16
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:57,472
You'll see. Couple of days, blend right in.

17
00:00:57,555 --> 00:01:00,016
You won't see the difference.

18
00:01:00,975 --> 00:01:04,020
I'm sure you're right. Thank you.

19
00:01:05,563 --> 00:01:09,150
You know, those kids were up there
again last night, running around,

20
00:01:09,233 --> 00:01:11,986
and I could hear them running water. So...

21
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:13,529
You know what I'm gonna do?

22
00:01:13,613 --> 00:01:17,325
I'm gonna speak with Murray
about changing the lock on 10F.

23
00:01:17,408 --> 00:01:20,370
You know what he told me?
Rimsky paid no rent this month.

24
00:01:20,453 --> 00:01:22,914
- He's probably not coming back anyway.
- OK.

25
00:01:22,997 --> 00:01:25,541
Well, that would be great
if you could change the lock.

26
00:01:25,625 --> 00:01:28,127
Starting to have nightmares
about what's going on up there.

27
00:01:28,211 --> 00:01:31,839
- Really? You gotta relax, huh?
- Can I get you something before you go?

28
00:01:31,923 --> 00:01:34,967
Yeah. Get me a reward
for all this hard work I've been doing.

29
00:01:35,051 --> 00:01:37,595
Yeah? I think I have beer.

30
00:01:37,679 --> 00:01:40,014
- You want a beer?
- I don't drink beer.

31
00:01:40,098 --> 00:01:42,266
Coffee? I could make a pot of coffee
if you want.

32
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:45,853
Oh, forget it. I've been working hard today.
I'm tired. I'm going.

33
00:01:45,937 --> 00:01:47,188
OK. Well, thank you.

34
00:01:47,271 --> 00:01:49,607
What about Hello Kitty? Can I have it now?

35
00:01:49,691 --> 00:01:52,819
Oh, so sorry, kid.
Somebody came by for it today.

36
00:01:52,902 --> 00:01:55,780
They were visiting town,
left it there by accident.

37
00:01:55,863 --> 00:01:59,492
Oh, that little girl,
she was so happy to have it back.

38
00:01:59,993 --> 00:02:01,661
- You're lying.
- Ceci.

39
00:02:01,744 --> 00:02:04,455
He's lying, Mommy. Nobody came.

40
00:02:04,539 --> 00:02:06,874
You want to teach that goddamn brat
some manners, lady.

41
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:09,377
Sorry.

42
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:12,338
What is the matter with you?

43
00:02:12,422 --> 00:02:13,339
Mm.

44
00:02:13,423 --> 00:02:17,343
Mac and cheese. My favourite.
I love you, Mommy.

45
00:02:17,427 --> 00:02:19,804
I love you too, sweetheart.
I love you very much.

46
00:02:19,887 --> 00:02:22,765
But, you know, it was very wrong of you
to call Mr Veeck a liar.

47
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:26,644
- You know that, don't you?
- He is a liar.

48
00:02:26,728 --> 00:02:30,023
Ceci. You don't know that he's a liar.

49
00:02:30,106 --> 00:02:32,525
- Yes, I do.
- How? How do you know that?

50
00:02:32,608 --> 00:02:37,655
Natasha told me he still had
the Hello Kitty backpack in his desk.

51
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:40,199
I want to talk to you
about your imaginary friend, OK?

52
00:02:40,283 --> 00:02:43,995
- She's not imaginary.
- She's not?

53
00:02:44,078 --> 00:02:48,624
She's lost. Her mommy forgot about her
and now she's lost.

54
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:52,045
Like you.

55
00:02:53,421 --> 00:02:58,092
- What are you talking about?
- Your mommy forgot about you, right?

56
00:02:59,093 --> 00:03:01,220
Did someone tell you that?

57
00:03:02,305 --> 00:03:05,058
- You did.
- No.

58
00:03:05,141 --> 00:03:08,436
I didn't tell you that, Ceci.

59
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:11,356
Who told you that?

60
00:03:13,983 --> 00:03:17,487
Are you gonna answer me?
I'm asking you a question.

61
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:19,947
- Who told you?
- Natasha told me.

62
00:03:20,031 --> 00:03:23,534
Stop it. You stop lying to me.

63
00:03:23,618 --> 00:03:25,828
Who told you?

64
00:03:27,664 --> 00:03:29,332
Who told you?

65
00:03:29,415 --> 00:03:32,001
Who told you?

66
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:41,427
- Hello?
- Hi, I'm just calling to arrange...

67
00:03:41,511 --> 00:03:46,557
What are you trying to do? Sneaking into
her school, telling her it isn't any good?

68
00:03:46,641 --> 00:03:49,894
Talking to her about my mother?
How dare you talk to her about my mother.

69
00:03:49,977 --> 00:03:53,731
Look, I don't know who or what pressed
your wacko button today, and I don't care,

70
00:03:53,815 --> 00:03:56,526
I'm calling to tell you I'm picking up Ceci
Saturday at nine.

71
00:03:56,609 --> 00:03:58,486
I'll bring her back Sunday at six.
Don't play any games.

72
00:03:58,569 --> 00:04:00,321
I'll bring her back Sunday at six.
Don't play any games.

73
00:04:00,405 --> 00:04:02,699
Have her there, 9am sharp.

74
00:04:31,227 --> 00:04:35,189
- I tell you punks. No skating in here.
- Yeah, yeah.

75
00:04:37,775 --> 00:04:40,737
She's cute.

76
00:04:41,404 --> 00:04:43,740
Daddy's here!

77
00:04:43,823 --> 00:04:45,867
Hey!

78
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,910
Look at you.

79
00:04:49,203 --> 00:04:51,289
You shouldn't be smoking, Daddy.

80
00:04:51,372 --> 00:04:53,499
I'm gonna quit real soon, honey. I promise.

81
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:58,171
- Thank you, Daddy.
- Satisfied?

82
00:04:58,254 --> 00:05:01,382
As far as I'm concerned,
you can smoke as much as you like, Kyle.

83
00:05:01,466 --> 00:05:03,426
Honey.

84
00:05:03,509 --> 00:05:06,137
- I'll bring her back tomorrow at six.
- OK.

85
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,723
- Bye, Mommy.
- Bye, honey.

86
00:05:44,717 --> 00:05:47,553
Hey, pretty lady. What's happening?

87
00:05:47,637 --> 00:05:50,431
Laundry. Excuse me.

88
00:05:50,515 --> 00:05:54,018
I got some dirty things I'd like you to clean.

89
00:06:49,365 --> 00:06:51,534
Sorry.

90
00:06:52,702 --> 00:06:55,163
I forgot my smokes.

91
00:09:07,462 --> 00:09:09,714
Help!

92
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:17,013
Smart-ass kids.
Steve and Billy. They did this.

93
00:09:17,096 --> 00:09:21,392
You'll see. Monday, the plumbers come.
They'll find something stuck in there.

94
00:09:21,476 --> 00:09:23,728
They gum 'em up. Brats.

95
00:09:24,729 --> 00:09:27,106
- Who's Natasha?
- What?

96
00:09:27,774 --> 00:09:30,360
Who's Natasha Rimsky?

97
00:09:30,443 --> 00:09:33,905
Little girl. 10F.

98
00:09:35,031 --> 00:09:38,618
- Where is she now?
- How do I know? With her mother, I guess.

99
00:09:38,701 --> 00:09:41,287
Couldrt stand living
with that crazy Russian husband of hers.

100
00:09:41,371 --> 00:09:45,667
Took the little girl with her.
That Russki, he was a piece of work.

101
00:09:48,586 --> 00:09:50,421
<i>Always "blyad".</i>

102
00:09:50,505 --> 00:09:53,091
Look, there's a Laundromat
down the block.

103
00:09:53,174 --> 00:09:58,054
I'll get you some garbage bags
so you don't get wet carrying them there.

104

<i>The ítsy-bítsy spíder

105
00:11:42,158 --> 00:11:44,285
Hi, Mommy.

106
00:11:47,705 --> 00:11:50,958
Glad you like spaghetti and meatballs.

107
00:11:51,042 --> 00:11:54,754
- It's my favourite.
- Your favourite?

108
00:11:54,837 --> 00:11:57,632
I love them, Mommy.

109
00:11:57,715 --> 00:12:00,009
I'm glad.

110
00:12:00,093 --> 00:12:01,969
Mm.

111
00:12:02,845 --> 00:12:05,264
I love you, Mommy.

112
00:12:05,348 --> 00:12:07,850
You haven't said anything
about what your dad's new place is like.

113
00:12:07,934 --> 00:12:09,018
- I don't like it.
- Really?

114
00:12:09,102 --> 00:12:10,186
Yeah.

115
00:12:10,269 --> 00:12:12,230
Well, maybe it's just new
and you need to get used to it.

116
00:12:12,313 --> 00:12:14,565
But I don't wanna get used to it.

117
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:19,737
I don't wanna stay with Daddy.
I only wanna stay with you.

118
00:12:20,446 --> 00:12:25,535
Well, your dad loves you. He'll be happy
that you spent this time with him.

- Why? It happened.

122
00:12:37,922 --> 00:12:40,633
I want to go to bed now, Mommy. I'm tired.

123
00:12:51,394 --> 00:12:53,646
- Mommy?
- Mm?

124
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:57,233
I'm scared, Mommy.
I want to sleep with you.

125
00:12:57,316 --> 00:12:59,444
Yeah.

126
00:13:13,207 --> 00:13:17,628
I love you, Mommy.
Thank you for taking care of me.

127
00:13:45,156 --> 00:13:47,241
Ceci?

128
00:13:57,085 --> 00:14:00,338
- Hello?
- Mommy, where were you?

129
00:14:00,421 --> 00:14:04,258
- I was napping.
- No, not now. Last night.

130
00:14:04,342 --> 00:14:09,472
Where were you last night? I called
two times for you to say goodnight to me.

131
00:14:09,555 --> 00:14:12,183
- Where were you?
- Last night?

132
00:14:12,266 --> 00:14:17,480
OK, Daddy. Daddy says he's bringing
me home a half an hour early.

133
00:14:17,563 --> 00:14:20,066
OK, Daddy. 5:30.

134
00:14:20,149 --> 00:14:22,735
He says to be there in the lobby at 5:30.

135
00:14:22,819 --> 00:14:24,988
- Don't fall asleep again, Mommy.
- OK.

136
00:14:25,071 --> 00:14:27,782
I gotta go. I'm getting chocolate cake.

137
00:14:27,865 --> 00:14:29,534
- Bye.
- Bye.

138
00:14:30,076 --> 00:14:32,245
Dahlia, where have you been?
I left two messages.

139
00:14:32,328 --> 00:14:34,747
I lost a day, Mary.

140
00:14:34,831 --> 00:14:40,003
I took a pill, just one pill,
and it knocked me out for 24 hours.

141
00:14:40,086 --> 00:14:41,921
That's never happened before.

142
00:14:42,005 --> 00:14:47,510
And I'm tired, really tired.
It's like I haven't slept at all.

143
00:14:47,593 --> 00:14:51,639
Dahlia, are you OK? Are you really OK?

144
00:14:51,723 --> 00:14:55,309
My headache's gone. But the leak is back.

145
00:14:55,393 --> 00:14:59,605
It's back?
I thought they were gonna fix that thing.

146
00:15:00,606 --> 00:15:02,984
- Dahlia?
- Yeah?

147
00:15:03,067 --> 00:15:07,488
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

148
00:15:08,156 --> 00:15:11,534
You have five new messages.
First new message.

149
00:15:11,617 --> 00:15:14,787
Long nap, huh? Call me.

150
00:15:14,871 --> 00:15:17,206
Message erased.
Next message.

151
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:20,918
Hi, Jeff Platzer here. I got the preliminaries
from your husband's lawyer

152
00:15:21,002 --> 00:15:24,297
and I need to touch base with you about
his accusations as soon as possible.

153
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:27,800
Believe it or not I'm actually available
on Sunday afternoon until five.

154
00:15:27,884 --> 00:15:31,346
If you are, would you call my cell?
OK. Bye.

155
00:15:40,813 --> 00:15:42,899
- Mrs Williams?
- Yeah.

156
00:15:42,982 --> 00:15:45,568
Hi. I'm your lawyer.

157
00:15:45,651 --> 00:15:48,071
- Hi.
- Hi.

158
00:15:49,072 --> 00:15:51,407
- I'm sorry it's such a mess.
- No, it's OK.

159
00:15:51,491 --> 00:15:54,911
I just moved into a new office
and they've painted it.

160
00:15:54,994 --> 00:15:57,580
I can't stand the smell so I'm improvising.

161
00:15:58,706 --> 00:16:00,833
OK.

162
00:16:05,421 --> 00:16:08,841
- Hi.
- Hi.

163
00:16:08,925 --> 00:16:12,387
- So...
- OK.

164
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,974
Your husband's claiming
you're mentally unstable

165
00:16:17,058 --> 00:16:19,602
because your father
was physically abusive

166
00:16:19,686 --> 00:16:23,356
and your mother was an alcoholic
who abandoned you.

167
00:16:23,439 --> 00:16:25,525
That's...

168
00:16:27,443 --> 00:16:29,737
unbelievable.

169
00:16:29,821 --> 00:16:33,950
- What do my parents have to do with this?
- That's my question exactly.

170
00:16:34,033 --> 00:16:38,830
What's more relevant is that your husband
says you suffer from crippling migraines

171
00:16:38,913 --> 00:16:41,124
and paranoid delusions.

172
00:16:41,207 --> 00:16:42,583
He says he'll submit school reports

173
00:16:42,667 --> 00:16:46,254
that show your daughter
is beginning to share your fantasy life.

174
00:16:46,337 --> 00:16:47,880
"Cecilia is now having trouble

175
00:16:47,964 --> 00:16:50,341
distinguishing between
what is real and what is not."

176
00:16:50,425 --> 00:16:52,385
It's a lie. It's a lie.

177
00:16:52,468 --> 00:16:55,388
In child custody briefs, it's standard
to make these kinds of accusations.

178
00:16:55,471 --> 00:16:56,889
Don't take it too seriously.

179
00:16:56,973 --> 00:17:00,977
But I do need to know what, if anything,
in your husband's narrative

180
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:06,482
has some semblance, some shred of fact
that he might produce in court.

181
00:17:06,566 --> 00:17:10,945
Well, I get migraines.
Yeah. That's true.

182
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:15,283
But they've never interfered
with my ability to do anything.

183
00:17:15,366 --> 00:17:20,872
You can talk to my doctor about that. He'll
tell you they've certainly never crippled me.

184
00:17:20,955 --> 00:17:22,457
Um...

185
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:27,628
As for Ceci, I think
she's a little bit Ionely right now.

186
00:17:27,712 --> 00:17:30,923
Her father's abandoned her and she was
forced to move from her neighbourhood.

187
00:17:31,007 --> 00:17:33,426
So...

188
00:17:33,509 --> 00:17:38,139
she's developed an imaginary friend.
But that's normal.

189
00:17:39,807 --> 00:17:44,937
That's fine. But for future reference, when
you're talking to, for example, a judge,

190
00:17:45,021 --> 00:17:47,732
I would stay away from phrases like,
"her father's abandoned her".

191
00:17:47,815 --> 00:17:50,860
It's important, when the other side
is being so melodramatic,

192
00:17:50,943 --> 00:17:54,405
- to sound like we're the sane ones.
- Right.

193
00:17:54,489 --> 00:17:57,116
- That's all I'm saying.
- OK.

194
00:18:16,844 --> 00:18:19,430
- I'd like to notch that.
- Oh, yeah, man.

195
00:18:27,021 --> 00:18:29,232
Hey, sweetheart.

196
00:18:32,443 --> 00:18:33,403
- Mommy?
- Yeah.

197
00:18:33,486 --> 00:18:36,990
- Look what Daddy gave me.
- Wow.

198
00:18:37,073 --> 00:18:42,036
- That's great, You're so lucky.
- Listen, next Saturday's a problem.

199
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,122
Can we do Sunday and I'll bring her
first thing in the morning

200
00:18:44,205 --> 00:18:46,499
for school on Monday?

201
00:18:46,582 --> 00:18:49,502
Yeah. Yeah, that's fine.

202
00:18:50,962 --> 00:18:54,716
- Come on, honey. Say bye to Daddy.
- Bye, Daddy. Thanks for the Barbie.

203
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,552
- Did you do that ponytail by yourself?
- Yeah.

204
00:18:57,635 --> 00:19:00,096
- It's a good one.
- Thanks.

205
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,104
- I like the collar.
- Thanks.

206
00:19:12,942 --> 00:19:15,486
Honey, you know what,
I forgot to do something.

207
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:17,780
I'm gonna be right back.
Will you wait right here for me?

208
00:19:17,864 --> 00:19:19,991
- Don't go anywhere, OK?
- OK.

209
00:19:20,074 --> 00:19:21,117
Be right back.

210
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,912
Two... one.

211
00:19:59,822 --> 00:20:01,824
Ceci?

212
00:20:03,868 --> 00:20:06,871
Ceci? Stay in the elevator.
I'm bringing you down.

213
00:20:09,707 --> 00:20:11,876
Ceci, can you hear me?

214
00:20:17,131 --> 00:20:21,969
Bake me a cake as fast as you can.
Roll it, pat it and mark it with a B.

215
00:20:22,053 --> 00:20:25,723
- No more pretending to play with Natasha.
- She won't let me.

216
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:29,394
Well, then you stop talking to her.
You tell her I said so.

217
00:20:29,477 --> 00:20:32,647
You tell her your mommy said
you can't play with her any more.

218
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:35,024
OK, Mommy.

219
00:20:40,238 --> 00:20:41,990
- Hello?
- Hi, Mr Platzer.

220
00:20:42,073 --> 00:20:45,201
I'm sorry to call you late,
but I think my husband...

221
00:20:45,284 --> 00:20:47,286
Mrs Williams, it's Sunday night.
I can't talk.

222
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:51,416
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry. I just need
to tell you this as soon as possible.

223
00:20:51,499 --> 00:20:53,626
I think my husband
is trying to drive me crazy.

224
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,670
Either that or he's hoping
that I'm gonna act crazy.

225
00:20:55,753 --> 00:20:59,507
- Hang on. Let me call you right back.
- OK.

226
00:21:01,217 --> 00:21:03,469
You say neither of the Rimskys
are living there?

227
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:05,888
No, no one's there.
So Kyle's paying these kids.

228
00:21:05,972 --> 00:21:07,640
I mean, he must be paying these kids

229
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:10,601
to mess around with the water
and the backpack. And the elevator.

230
00:21:10,685 --> 00:21:14,188
I went into the elevator the other day
and the buttons were burned off.

231
00:21:14,272 --> 00:21:17,400
Mrs Williams, it's Sunday night
and I'm at the movies with my family.

232
00:21:17,483 --> 00:21:21,404
If I don't want to be handling
my own divorce, I gotta get back. So...

233
00:21:21,487 --> 00:21:23,740
I'll call you tomorrow
and we'll sort this out. All right?

234
00:21:23,823 --> 00:21:25,241
Yeah. Absolutely.

235
00:21:30,955 --> 00:21:33,374
Get down!

236
00:21:57,815 --> 00:22:00,860
This time make sure
you put it in the garbage truck.

237
00:22:00,943 --> 00:22:03,071
- Where did you...
- Those kids have been playing games,

238
00:22:03,154 --> 00:22:04,739
moving it around the building.

239
00:22:04,822 --> 00:22:09,077
And they were upstairs again so now
there's water all over my bedroom floor.

240
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,245
- They're running the water again?
- Mm-hm.

241
00:22:11,329 --> 00:22:13,373
I thought you were gonna
change the lock on 10F.

242
00:22:13,456 --> 00:22:16,959
Murray didn't authorise it.
He has to send me a 112B form.

243
00:22:17,043 --> 00:22:20,755
- Look, is the plumber here yet?
- No, no. It's only 8:15.

244
00:22:20,838 --> 00:22:25,385
OK, look. I left a message for Mr Murray.
I told him I need my problem fixed first.

245
00:22:25,468 --> 00:22:28,137
So when the plumber gets here,
send him up to my apartment

246
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:32,266
or you and Murray
can both talk to my lawyer. OK?

247
00:22:46,072 --> 00:22:48,491
Do you remember
what we talked about last night?

248
00:22:48,574 --> 00:22:51,744
- Yes, Mommy.
- OK.

249
00:22:54,789 --> 00:22:56,457
See you later, OK?

250
00:22:57,625 --> 00:22:59,627
- Hello.
- Hi. Jeff Platzer here.

251
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:02,839
- Hi, Mr Platzer.
- Listen, I did a little homework on Rimsky

252
00:23:02,922 --> 00:23:05,717
and I think I turned up the missing mother
in a hospital in San Diego.

253
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,968
Why are you looking for her?

254
00:23:07,051 --> 00:23:10,680
I figured the Rimskys might want to know
their apartment's being used by strangers.

255
00:23:10,763 --> 00:23:13,766
Mrs Williams, we're never gonna prove
your husband's behind this harassment.

256
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:17,979
And trying to do that is just playing
his game. He wants you to look paranoid.

257
00:23:18,062 --> 00:23:20,189
We gotta deal with this straight,
as if it's all on the level.

258
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:22,567
So that's what we'll do,
we'll play it straight.

259
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:25,153
I'm due in court, I'll call you
when I get ahold of Mrs Rimsky.

260
00:23:25,236 --> 00:23:28,031
In the meantime, just sit tight.

261
00:23:28,114 --> 00:23:30,658
- I will. Thanks so much.
- OK.

262
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,994
- Bye.
- Bye.

263
00:23:33,077 --> 00:23:36,664
- Abigail's making a storm, sweetheart.
- Done!

264
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:39,876
Done? You remember you have
to sign your name so you know whose it is.

265
00:23:39,959 --> 00:23:44,213
You don't want me to take that home
and say I did it, do you?

266
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:47,216
I like that. Pirates?

267
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:51,262
Stop it.

268
00:23:52,513 --> 00:23:54,891
Stop it, I told you, leave me alone.

269
00:23:54,974 --> 00:23:57,226
- We've got rainbows...
- Stop it!

270
00:23:57,852 --> 00:24:00,355
Stop it!

271
00:24:00,521 --> 00:24:02,732
Stop it!

272
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:05,026
Stop it!

273
00:24:10,156 --> 00:24:11,824
You're gonna get cleaned up
and when you're done

274
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:15,953
you're gonna come back and sit with me
and we'll read a story together.

275
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:19,332
Then maybe we'll talk about your friend.

276
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:24,587
Go on.

277
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,826
Ceci!

278
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:01,290
Go away!

279
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,316
- Where is she?
- She passed out in the bathroom.

280
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:28,818
We don't know what happened.
There was water all over the place.

281
00:25:28,901 --> 00:25:30,486
- We took her to the hospital.
- Hospital?

282
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,989
We just wanted to check her out.
It's school policy. We couldn't reach you.

283
00:25:33,072 --> 00:25:36,200
I had an emergency at work,
I didn't get my messages for two hours.

284
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:38,578
We called her father
and he's gonna meet her at the hospital.

285
00:25:38,661 --> 00:25:42,248
- OK. Which hospital?
- It's the one right here on the island.

286
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:45,043
Kyle took her.
They released her and he took her.

287
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:48,588
- Did they say what was wrong?
- They said, you know, it's nothing serious.

288
00:25:48,671 --> 00:25:50,340
She fainted but...

289
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:55,345
I'm trying to find him. I called his home
number, I called his cell phone number,

290
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:57,930
I called his office number,
and he's avoiding me

291
00:25:58,014 --> 00:26:00,725
so I need to know what to do.
Can I go to his apartment?

292
00:26:00,808 --> 00:26:03,686
Mrs Williams, I need you to calm down.
I need it, your daughter needs it.

293
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,021
Just calm down, OK?

294
00:26:05,104 --> 00:26:07,357
I'm sorry. I know you don't know me,
but you have to believe me.

295
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,609
I'm not crazy, I'm really not.

296
00:26:09,692 --> 00:26:11,444
- I believe you, Mrs Williams.
- I'm really not.

297
00:26:11,527 --> 00:26:15,448
Just go home. Your husband and your
daughter are probably waiting for you.

298
00:26:15,531 --> 00:26:18,743
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

299
00:26:19,952 --> 00:26:21,663
Ceci.

300
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:24,957
Ceci.

301
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:32,090
- No new messages.
- Oh, God.

302
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:36,636
- Hello?
- Hello? It's Jeff. Are they there?

303
00:26:36,719 --> 00:26:37,762
- No.
- They're not there?

304
00:26:37,845 --> 00:26:41,891
No. There's no message.

305
00:26:41,974 --> 00:26:44,310
There's water everywhere.

306
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:48,481
Mrs Williams, Mrs Williams, calm down.
Calm down.

307
00:26:48,564 --> 00:26:50,984
- She can't be here.
- What do you want me to do?

308
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:53,069
Oh, God.

309
00:26:53,152 --> 00:26:57,240
I can't be her mother,
I don't know how to be myself.

310
00:26:58,199 --> 00:27:00,201
Ceci!

311
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:12,005
I hate you.
Get away from me, you little bitch.

312
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:14,257
I hate you.

313
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,383
Fuck!

314
00:27:15,466 --> 00:27:18,928
I hate you! I hate you!

315
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:21,055
Bitch!

316
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:33,735
Sorry about this. I really had no idea.

317
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:36,237
I would've come down myself
a long time ago.

318
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:54,589
Better open it.

319
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:59,052
Hello?

320
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:01,387
Hello?

321
00:28:05,099 --> 00:28:07,268
Jesus.

322
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:13,608
Look at this. This is appalling.
This is appalling.

323
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:17,904
The plumber's on his way. I'm paying him
double overtime so he can get here tonight.

324
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:20,114
Hello?

325
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,078
- I'll get some of these lights on.
- Mrs Williams?

326
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:30,458
- You OK?
- I'm awake.

327
00:28:30,541 --> 00:28:32,960
The plumber will be here in 15 minutes.

328
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:36,881
- Mr Murray?
- This is just a big misunderstanding. OK?

329
00:28:36,964 --> 00:28:40,051
Mr Veeck did not keep me informed.
This will be fixed tonight.

330
00:28:40,134 --> 00:28:43,680
- Or she's staying at the Plaza, right?
- It will definitely be fixed tonight.

331
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:46,599
- And I want to talk to Veeck.
- I will get him.

332
00:28:50,728 --> 00:28:52,814
You OK?

333
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:56,567
- Migraine, huh?
- Yeah.

334
00:29:00,446 --> 00:29:03,616
- I'll keep my voice low.
- Thanks.

335
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,411
I spoke with your husband's lawyer
and Ceci's fine.

336
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:08,830
Kyle will bring her to school in the morning.

337
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:10,540
OK.

338
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:13,626
Now, this part is gonna piss you off.

339
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:16,587
They want Ceci to see a psychologist
to be evaluated.

340
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:22,427
There's nothing we can do about that
but say yes. So we're saying yes.

341
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,887
OK.

342
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:29,392
- Here we are.
- Mr Veeck.

343
00:29:29,475 --> 00:29:31,561
I had an interesting conversation
with Mrs Rimsky today.

344
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:34,564
She was very surprised to hear
her daughter isn't living upstairs.

345
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:37,275
- In 10F?
- Mm-hm.

346
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:40,278
- You said they left together.
- That's what the Russian said.

347
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:43,364
No, she left without her daughter.
She didn't think she could take care of her.

348
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,908
Mrs Rimsky's an alcoholic.
She claimed she was going for treatment,

349
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:48,661
and had to leave the girl behind
with the father.

350
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:50,955
You knew that, didn't you?

351
00:29:51,497 --> 00:29:54,500
Only Mr Rimsky didn't take Natasha
with him.

352
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:56,461
I spoke with Grandma Rimsky
in Moscow today

353
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:59,047
and she said her son
is living with her alone.

354
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:03,051
- So he lied to me. What do I know?
- You had to know.

355
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:07,764
Well, we'll find out tomorrow. I have
a phone appointment with Mr Rimsky.

356
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:12,185
- Why did you lie about the little girl?
- I didn't want to get involved, that's all.

357
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:15,188
Did you see Natasha after her mother left?

358
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,902
It's a simple question, Veeck.

359
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:25,823
Yeah. I see her. I see her that afternoon.
I see her playing on the stairs.

360
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:30,703
Then the next day the father tells me she
leave with the mother. I ask no questions.

361
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:34,040
- Well, if he killed her, it's not my business.
- "Killed her"?

362
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:36,709
"If he killed her"?

363
00:30:38,252 --> 00:30:40,088
Plumber!

364
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:43,800
You got a lot more than a leak to fix,
Mr Murray.

365
00:30:44,842 --> 00:30:46,928
Mr Veeck.

366
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:53,101
- If you could just...
- Come on in, just right inside.

367
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,395
Thank you.

368
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:58,564
Some kind of pipe or something.

369
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:02,235
Yeah, well, see, that is a brand-new pipe.
So, this will all be patched tomorrow.

370
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:05,113
- By professionals.
- By professionals. Good as new.

371
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:10,118
It better be. I'm calling NYPD
to report a child is missing.

372
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:14,414
OK. I mean, I'm sure there's
a simple explanation for that, but...

373
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:19,877
So, goodnight.
And, again, I am so sorry about all this.

374
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:23,881
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

375
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:27,885
- You gonna be OK?
- Yeah. I'll be fine.

376
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:33,641
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm feeling much better, actually.

377
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:36,728
- I gotta go. Family.
- OK. Mm.

378
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:41,733
I'll keep my cell on all night
and if you need me just call.

379
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:44,068
- Any hour.
- Thanks.

380
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:47,697
- Thanks again. Bye.
- OK. Bye.

381
00:31:59,917 --> 00:32:02,587
She left you behind.

382
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:07,091
They both left you behind.

383
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:09,344
Help me.

384
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:45,672
Wait!

385
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:28,941
I told Murray, I told him a million times.

386
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:32,528
It's not my job. I'm not a goddamn plumber.

387
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,289
How you feeling? You OK?

388
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:45,541
- You warmed up?
- I'm OK.

389
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:50,296
Cops think Veeck probably
left the tank open and somehow she fell in.

390
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:53,341
They even think he might have discovered
she'd fallen in weeks ago.

391
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:56,344
That's why he hadrt cleaned it in so long.

392
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:58,805
They might have enough to charge him
with criminal negligence.

393
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:04,143
They'd arrest the parents, but they're out
of state and there are no witnesses, so...

394
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:08,940
The truth is, they'll probably
never know what happened.

395
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:12,694
Her mother left her.

396
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:16,948
The father assumed
that she was with her mom,

397
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:21,953
and the mother assumed
she was with her father.

398
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:28,751
Guess everyone just assumed.

399
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:31,629
No one really cared what happened to her.

400
00:35:31,713 --> 00:35:34,674
That's what it looks like.

401
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:41,723
I'll tell Mary you've been a prince.

402
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,808
You just accomplished the impossible,
Mrs Williams.

403
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:47,562
You actually made me glad
I went to law school.

404
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:54,944
- Thank you.
- It's OK.

405
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:58,031
I can probably get you
a year's free rent out of Murray.

406
00:35:58,114 --> 00:36:00,992
Oh! No, it's OK.

407
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:03,202
I'm moving.

408
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:06,581
- Call me in the morning, OK?
- Yeah.

409
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:25,767
- Come on, princess.
- Bye, Daddy.

410
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,144
Bye.

411
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:38,571
- How are you feeling?
- Good.

412
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:40,907
Yeah?

413
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:49,582
OK. I'll be here after school to pick you up.
See you after school.

414
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:56,881
- Hey.
- Hi.

415
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,259
Thank you for taking care
of Ceci yesterday.

416
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:04,472
It's OK. I'm really worried
about her mental state.

417
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,974
- I am too.
- You are?

418
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,935
Yeah.

419
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:12,480
So, I've been thinking...

420
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:15,650
I don't want her
to have to choose between us.

421
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:19,404
- What do you mean?
- I want to look for a place in Jersey City

422
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:22,573
so that shared custody
will be easier for both of us.

423
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:26,202
And we can do, you know,
one week with me, and one week with you.

424
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:29,372
Or maybe split the week.
We can see what works best.

425
00:37:30,123 --> 00:37:34,752
- You serious?
- Yeah. Yeah.

426
00:37:34,836 --> 00:37:39,465
Hey, you know, you were right about the
school here. I checked it out. It's good.

427
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:42,677
- Maybe I could get a place...
- No, it's fine.

428
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:47,223
After this, we'll get a...
a place in Jersey City.

429
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,441
I'll see you later.

430
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:06,117
- When are we moving?
- Not until next week, sweetheart.

431
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:10,913
This is winter stuff though
so we can pack it up now.

432
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:14,083
You OK? Are you feeling OK?

433
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:29,599
What are you thinking about?

434
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:32,894
Why did her mommy forget about her?

435
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:46,991
Do you know how much I love you?

436
00:38:49,786 --> 00:38:52,872
- You sure?
- Mm-hm.

437
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:56,918
- Do you know I would do anything for you?
- Yes.

438
00:38:58,086 --> 00:39:00,505
That's a promise.

439
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:04,509
- Honey, do you want bubbles tonight?
- Uh-huh.

440
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:09,764
There you are.

441
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:14,852
- That's so great, Dahlia.
- Well, I think it's gonna be for the best.

442
00:39:14,936 --> 00:39:18,272
And moving out of here,
that is definitely for the best.

443
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:22,318
What do you want to do? Be a chef? OK.

444
00:39:22,402 --> 00:39:25,613
Let's see if we can make you a chef hat.

445
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:30,576
There.

446
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:33,454
Now, what are you going to cook?

447
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:36,749
Mac and cheese?

448
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:40,128
Look, I should go get Ceci out of the tub
before she turns into a prune.

449
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,588
- She's so cute.
- So... Oh!

450
00:39:42,672 --> 00:39:45,925
Here she is now.
Yeah. So I will talk to you tomorrow.

451
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:47,468
- OK. Take care. Bye.
- OK. You too.

452
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:48,803
Goodnight.

453
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:53,349
- Mommy, can you read me a story?
- Course I can, honey.

454
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:01,190
Let's see which one you picked.

455
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:16,914
We haven't read this one
in a long time, have we?

456
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:24,255
"There were once a man and a woman
who had long in vain wished for a child."

457
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:27,175
We need more snow, don't you think?

458
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:30,720
Then let's get some more snow.

459
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:38,436
...beautiful Rapunzel.

460
00:40:51,074 --> 00:40:54,827
Don't leave me.
I want you to be my mommy.

461
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:57,497
- Don't leave me.
- Ceci!

462
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:00,124
You can't leave me.

463
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:04,879
Ceci!

464
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:07,090
Ceci!

465
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:08,883
Ceci!

466
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:10,927
Ceci!

467
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:15,848
Ceci!

468
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:19,102
No!

469
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,480
Ceci!

470
00:41:28,695 --> 00:41:30,863
Ceci!

471
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,198
Ceci!

472
00:41:33,533 --> 00:41:35,535
Oh, God.

473
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:38,955
Let her go! You let her go!

474
00:41:44,377 --> 00:41:46,045
No!

475
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:03,730
No! Please!

476
00:42:03,813 --> 00:42:07,525
Natasha! Let her go! Please.

477
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:11,404
We'll stay. We'll stay here with you.

478
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:16,284
What do you want?

479
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:20,121
I'll be your mother.

480
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:22,457
- Please.
- Forever?

481
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:27,587
Forever.

482
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:29,839
Forever. Yes.

483
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:33,217
I'll be your mother forever.

484
00:42:33,301 --> 00:42:36,304
Take me. Please, take me.

485
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:45,456
Yeah, OK. So we got an 11-46,
Caucasian female, aged 30,

486
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:48,960
no apparent cause of death,
and a six-year-old girl with shock.

487
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:51,087
Trying to locate the father.

488
00:44:03,266 --> 00:44:05,393
Ceci.

489
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:48,853
Let's go home, honey.
Would you get the door?

490
00:45:30,186 --> 00:45:34,065
We did a whole bunch of them.
A whole neighbourhood.

491
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:36,693
What was this one about?
Do you remember?

492
00:45:36,776 --> 00:45:39,862
That was me and then that was you.

493
00:45:39,946 --> 00:45:43,408
- That was a tree.
- A tree.

494
00:45:43,491 --> 00:45:49,497
- And then that's a little angel.
- Beautiful gold wings on the angel.

495
00:46:12,645 --> 00:46:14,647
Come on.

496
00:46:16,858 --> 00:46:19,402
OK, honey, let's walk.

497
00:46:21,738 --> 00:46:24,449
What's wrong with you?

498
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:30,997
Come on.

499
00:46:35,376 --> 00:46:36,586
Ceci.

500
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:38,296
Ceci?

501
00:46:38,546 --> 00:46:39,505
Ceci?

502
00:46:39,589 --> 00:46:41,924
Open the door.
Push the button, Ceci.

503
00:46:42,008 --> 00:46:44,886
Open it. Open the door. Ceci!

504
00:47:14,082 --> 00:47:16,459
My beautiful girl.

505
00:47:28,054 --> 00:47:30,640
Whenever you need me, I'm here.

506
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:36,980
OK, Daddy. Let's go.

507
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:47,980
