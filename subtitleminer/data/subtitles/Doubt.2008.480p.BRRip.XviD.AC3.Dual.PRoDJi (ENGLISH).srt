00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:00,000
Jimmy? Come on.
You're serving today.

2
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,000
Christine?
Where's my pants?

3
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,440
On the bed.
If they had teeth they would've bit you.

4
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,840
Jimmy! Go to the store,
buy me the newspaper and cigarettes.

5
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,720
Can't. Serving mass. I'm an altar boy.

6
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,280
- Hey, Kevin!
- Hey, Jimmy!

7
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,800
- There you are.
- Overslept.

8
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,840
Well, you made it. I'll do the cruets
if you light the charcoal.

9
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,200
You think I'm fat?

10
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,240
You're all right. What?
Clothes don't fit?

11
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,800
No, they fit.

12
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,520
You're gonna be going to the bakery
after mass.

13
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,600
I am? Why don't you go?

14
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,720
I'm gonna be making breakfast.

15
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,840
I can make breakfast.

16
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,560
When have you ever?

17
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,240
Funny man.

18
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,360
Good morning, Connie.
- Good morning.

19
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,280
<i>Holy God, we praise thy name</i>

20
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,160
Good morning, Father.

21
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:28,960
<i>Lord of all, we bow before thee</i>

22
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:35,440
<i>All on Earth thy scepter claim</i>

23
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:41,800
<i>All in heaven above adore thee</i>

24
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,680
<i>Infinite thy vast domain</i>

25
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:53,560
<i>Everlasting is thy reign</i>

26
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:59,640
<i>Infinite thy vast domain</i>

27
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:07,160
<i>Everlasting is thy reign</i>

28
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,640
<i>Be seated.</i>

29
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,400
<i>What do you do when you're not sure?</i>

30
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,040
<i>That's the topic of my sermon today.</i>

31
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,040
<i>Last year when
President Kennedy was assassinated,</i>

32
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:43,120
<i>who among us did not experience
the most profound disorientation?</i>

33
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,480
<i>Despair?</i>

34
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,080
<i>Which way? What now?</i>

35
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,720
<i>What do I say to my kids?
What do I tell myself?</i>

36
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,960
<i>It was a time of people sitting together,</i>

37
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,160
<i>bound together
by a common feeling of hopelessness.</i>

38
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,840
<i>But think of that.</i>

39
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:13,200
<i>Your bond with your fellow being
was your despair.</i>

40
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,880
<i>It was a public experience.
It was awful,</i>

41
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,880
<i>but we were in it together.</i>

42
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:28,720
<i>How much worse is it then
for the lone man, the lone woman,</i>

43
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,240
<i>stricken by a private calamity?</i>

44
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:39,280
<i>"No one knows I'm sick. " "No one
knows I've lost my last real friend. "</i>

45
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,640
<i>"No one knows
I've done something wrong. "</i>

46
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,440
<i>Imagine the isolation.</i>

47
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,840
<i>Now you see the world
as through a window.</i>

48
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,000
<i>On one side of the glass,
happy untroubled people,</i>

49
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,600
<i>and on the other side, you.</i>

50
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,880
- God bless you, Sister.
- Thank you.

51
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,520
<i>I wanna tell you a story.</i>

52
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:11,960
<i>A cargo ship sank one night.
It caught fire and went down,</i>

53
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,560
<i>and only this one sailor survived.</i>

54
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,880
<i>He found a lifeboat, rigged a sail,</i>

55
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,360
<i>and being of a nautical discipline</i>

56
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,200
<i>turned his eyes to the heavens
and read the stars.</i>

57
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,160
<i>He set a course for his home,
and, exhausted, fell asleep.</i>

58
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,960
Just keeps going on.

59
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,680
<i>Clouds rolled in,</i>

60
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:39,560
<i>and for the next 20 nights,
he could no longer see the stars.</i>

61
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:45,000
<i>He thought he was on course,
but there was no way to be certain.</i>

62
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,440
<i>And as the days rolled on,
and the sailor wasted away,</i>

63
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,600
<i>he began to have doubts.</i>

64
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:59,320
<i>- He just keeps on going.
- Had he set his course right?</i>

65
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,760
<i>Was he still going on
towards his home?</i>

66
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:08,560
<i>Or was he horribly lost
and doomed to a terrible death?</i>

67
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,960
<i>No way to know.</i>

68
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,040
<i>The message of the constellations,</i>

69
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,680
<i>had he imagined it because
of his desperate circumstance?</i>

70
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,560
<i>- Or had he seen truth once...
- Straighten up!</i>

71
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:29,520
<i>...and now had to hold on to it
without further reassurance?</i>

72
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,000
<i>There are those of you in church today</i>

73
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,240
<i>who know exactly
the crisis of faith I describe,</i>

74
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,000
<i>and I wanna say to you,</i>

75
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:48,560
<i>doubt can be a bond as powerful
and sustaining as certainty.</i>

76
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,440
<i>When you are lost, you are not alone.</i>

77
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,440
<i>In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost. Amen.</i>

78
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,560
<i>Please rise.</i>

79
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,240
<i>Praise God,
from whom all blessings flow</i>

80
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,520
<i>Praise him all creatures here...</i>

81
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,120
- Hey, Father.
- Hey, champ.

82
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,520
That was some sermon.

83
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,280
Did it mean something to you?

84
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,880
I wanna do that. I wanna be a priest.

85
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,760
You'd be a good one, I'm sure. Here.

86
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,080
Take a look.

87
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,800
See?

88
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,520
- She's dancing. Kind of neat?
- Yeah.

89
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,160
Here. You try.

90
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,200
That's for you. Take it.

91
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,480
- Thank you, Father.
- Welcome.

92
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,440
Like Noah's Ark, girls. Two by two.

93
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,080
Maryanne said it.
Let's do it together.

94
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,320
Okay.
Yeah. It's true.

95
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,760
And did I tell you that Jessica's
having a sleepover on Saturday?

96
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,600
Morning, Sister James.

97
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,360
Good morning, Father Flynn.
Beautiful day.

98
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,800
Not too bad.
How're the criminals doing today?

99
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,480
- Not bad, Father.
- Good, Father.

100
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,240
- Morning, champ.
- Morning, Father Flynn.

101
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,120
You wash those hands today,
Mr. London?

102
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,880
I washed them, Father.

103
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,920
I don't know. They're a different color
than your neck.

104
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,360
Morning.
Morning, Father Flynn.

105
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,320
- Sister, are we having the test today?
Get in line.

106
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,920
Tomorrow, William.

107
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,160
- Is it long division?
- Among other things.

108
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,800
Sister.
- Good morning, Sister.

109
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,800
- How much of it will be long division?
Boy!

110
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,440
William London. Come up here.

111
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:48,720
Come smartly, now.
Don't make me wait.

112
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,440
What did he do?
He touched Sister James.

113
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,120
The dragon is hungry.

114
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,040
You don't touch a nun.

115
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,800
Take out your history books, please.
Turn to page 683.

116
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,920
- Yes, Ralph.
- I forgot my history book.

117
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,240
You can look on with Raymond.

118
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,960
Mr. London?

119
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,960
- Do you have your history book?
- No, Sister.

120
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:30,120
- Share with Mr. Malloy, please.
- Do I have to? His breath stinks!

121
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,880
I'm sure Mr. Malloy's breath is just fine.

122
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,920
Be seated.

123
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,280
Franklin Delano Roosevelt was the
32nd president of the United States.

124
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,080
That barrette out of your hair,
Miss Horan.

125
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,560
Yes, Sister.

126
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,240
Morning, Sister James.
Continue.

127
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,600
Franklin D. Roosevelt, together with

128
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,640
Abraham Lincoln
and John Fitzgerald Kennedy,

129
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,920
was perhaps our greatest president.
When he assumed office,

130
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,960
13 million people in this country
were unemployed.

131
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,480
They'd lost hope,

132
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,560
and President Roosevelt
said to these people,

133
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,720
"The only thing we have to fear
is fear itself. "

134
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,120
What did he mean by that? James?

135
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,640
I think he was trying to say
there's nothing really wrong.

136
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,040
- You know? So don't get so emotional.
Maybe.

137
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,000
Maybe he was saying that
the world is good

138
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,720
and we need only work together
to overcome our problems.

139
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,760
What's this, Mr. Conroy?

140
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,720
I don't know, Sister.

141
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:50,160
You don't know you have a wire
coming out of your ear?

142
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,320
- No.
- Huh?

143
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,160
Huh?

144
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,600
No, Sister. I didn't.

145
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,840
You come with me, boy.

146
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,600
Go.

147
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,240
Who knows what the New Deal was?

148
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,480
<i>The first noel</i>

149
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,800
<i>The angels did say</i>

150
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:33,320
<i>Was to certain poor shepherds
in fields as they lay</i>

151
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,080
I love this song.

152
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:40,880
<i>In fields where they lay
keeping their sheep</i>

153
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:47,440
<i>On a cold winter's night
that was so deep</i>

154
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:03,400
This past Sunday, what do you think
that sermon was about? Sister James?

155
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,000
Huh?

156
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,240
What was
Father Flynn's sermon about?

157
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:15,080
Well, doubt.
He was talking about doubt.

158
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,360
- Why?
- Excuse me, Sister?

159
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,440
Well, sermons come from somewhere,
don't they?

160
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,720
Is Father Flynn in doubt?

161
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,840
Is he concerned
that someone else is in doubt?

162
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,320
I suppose you'd have to ask him.

163
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,480
No, that would not be appropriate.

164
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,960
He is my superior,

165
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,800
and if he were troubled
he should confess it to a fellow priest

166
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,560
or to the monsignor.

167
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,120
We do not share
intimate information with priests.

168
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,080
- No.
- That's true.

169
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,760
What are we saying?

170
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,040
I want you all to be alert.

171
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:58,800
I am concerned, perhaps needlessly,
about matters in St. Nicholas School.

172
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,680
Academically?

173
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,840
I was not inviting a guessing game,
Sister Raymond.

174
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,960
Missy! Get away from her,
and sit down.

175
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,760
- May I join you, Sister Aloysius?
- Yes.

176
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,480
- Chicken chow mein.
- Sister Veronica's favorite.

177
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,560
It's very good.

178
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,680
I like the noodles. I like the crunch.

179
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:44,000
- What happened to William London?
- I sent him home.

180
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,000
- Oh, dear. So he's still bleeding?
- Yes.

181
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,080
His nose just let loose

182
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,560
and started gushing
during the Pledge of Allegiance.

183
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,120
Was it spontaneous?

184
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,360
- What?
- His nosebleed.

185
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,160
- What else would it be?
- Self-induced.

186
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,240
Mmm-hmm.

187
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,400
You mean you think

188
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,640
he might have intentionally
given himself a nosebleed?

189
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,000
Exactly.

190
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,240
No.

191
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,920
You are a very innocent person,
Sister James.

192
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,760
William London is a fidgety boy.

193
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:22,000
If you do not keep right on him,
he will do anything to escape his chair.

194
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,240
He would set his foot on fire
for half a day out of school.

195
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,760
Here. Sister, allow me to help you.
Your sleeve.

196
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,640
Uh-oh.

197
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,880
- Let's see.
- Oh, thank you, Sister.

198
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,720
- Sister Veronica is going blind.
- Oh, how horrible.

199
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,040
If they find out in the rectory,
she'll be gone.

200
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,320
So if she looks unsteady,
take her hand.

201
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:55,600
Ordinarily I assign my most
experienced teachers to eighth grade,

202
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,880
but I am working within constraints.

203
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,680
- Are you in control of your class?
- I think so.

204
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,520
Usually more students
are sent down to me.

205
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,120
I try to take care of things myself.

206
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,120
That can be an error.

207
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,440
You are answerable to me,
I to the monsignor,

208
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,120
he to the bishop,
and so on up to the Holy Father.

209
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,680
There is a chain. Make use of it.

210
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,080
Candy?

211
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,000
Cough drops.

212
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,360
Candy by another name.

213
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,560
How is Donald Miller doing?

214
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,760
- Steady.
- Good.

215
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,800
That girl, Noreen Horan.

216
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,840
I've seated her
as far away from the boys as possible.

217
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,200
- Doesn't do much good.
- Mmm.

218
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:52,400
Just get her through intact.

219
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,080
What's this?

220
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:05,520
The wind is so peripatetic this year.

221
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:10,880
- Is that the word I want?
Is something the matter?

222
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,520
What?

223
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,840
Is something the matter?
No.

224
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,520
- Why? Is something the matter?
- I don't think so.

225
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:25,000
- Well, then, nothing's the matter then.
- Yes.

226
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,880
- What's this?
- A pen.

227
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,280
A ballpoint pen.

228
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,480
The students are not using them
for assignments, I hope.

229
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,600
No, of course not.

230
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,800
I am sorry I allowed even
cartridge pens into this school.

231
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,280
Always easy way out, these days.

232
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:46,480
Every easy choice today
will have its consequence tomorrow.

233
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,480
- Mark my words.
- Yes, Sister.

234
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,400
Ballpoints make them press down.

235
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,240
When they press down,
they write like monkeys.

236
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,040
- I don't allow them ballpoint pens.
- And yet here one is.

237
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,760
Penmanship is dying
all across this country.

238
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,880
I hope not.

239
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,720
You should frame something.

240
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:11,880
Put it up on the blackboard.
Put the pope up.

241
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,240
That's the wrong pope. He's deceased.

242
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:19,920
I don't care what pope it is.
Use the glass to see behind you.

243
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:24,000
Children should think you have eyes
in the back of your head.

244
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,960
Wouldn't that be a little frightening?

245
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,680
Only to the ones
who are up to no good.

246
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,280
Relax. Put it up there.

247
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,200
All right, now.

248
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:46,240
The thing about shooting
from the foul line is it's psychological.

249
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,000
All right, come up with a routine.

250
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,800
You shift your weight, move your hips...

251
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,200
Yeah, you think that's funny, Ralph?

252
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,880
You know what's funny is
you never getting a foul shot.

253
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:02,280
All right, concentrate on the routine,
and you'll forget to get tensed up.

254
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,560
All right, go ahead, Jimmy.

255
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:15,720
Good man. You listen. That's good.
All right, now sit down, everyone.

256
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,120
Good.

257
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,240
On another matter, I've noticed
several of you guys got dirty nails.

258
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,680
All right, I don't want to see that.

259
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,360
I'm not talking about
the length of your nails.

260
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,840
I'm talking about cleanliness.

261
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,840
See, look at my nails.

262
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,920
- All right, they're long.
- Whoa!

263
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:46,160
Yeah, I like them a little long,
but look at how clean they are.

264
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,280
That makes it okay.

265
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:05,040
The climpity-clomp.
Clomp-clomp-clomp.

266
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,280
Harder than a herd of elephants.

267
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,640
You are wicked!

268
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,600
No, I told her, "You're her mother.

269
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,760
"You raised her. You fed her.
You tell her she's fat. "

270
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,360
But wait, how fat is she?

271
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,000
- What, the mother or the daughter?
- The daughter.

272
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,320
I never met the daughter.

273
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,560
- What about the mother?
- Fat.

274
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,080
Father, we having practice
after school?

275
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,320
If you guys want it, we can have it.
Let me know.

276
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:31,120
The Fascist governments
of Germany and Italy

277
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,480
were already working together.

278
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,400
They formed the Pact of Steel.

279
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,800
The Pact of Steel was...

280
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,000
- Hi.
- Hi.

281
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,680
...a military alliance between
Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler.

282
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:49,200
Mr. London, get back in your seat
and stop bothering Miss Horan, please.

283
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,840
Now, who can tell me...

284
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,400
Yes?

285
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,280
Yes. Of course, Father.

286
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,960
Donald? You should go to the rectory.

287
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:18,000
Two, three, four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten, eleven.

288
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:24,040
Go one, two, three, touch.
One, two, three, kick.

289
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:29,160
And back, side, front, kick.
Back, side, front. Again.

290
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,240
<i>We began to dance</i>

291
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,840
<i>Swaying to and fro</i>

292
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:38,840
<i>And soon I knew
I'd never let him go</i>

293
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,520
- Raymond, what are you doing?
- The mashed potato.

294
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,680
You're supposed to be doing
the bossa nova.

295
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,800
- But I know the mashed potato.
- Oh...

296
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:54,200
All right, now follow.
Back, side, front, kick.

297
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:59,000
Back, side... One, two, three, kick.

298
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:03,720
Back, side, front, kick.
Back, side, front...

299
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:09,160
Let me get in front of you
so that you can see what I'm doing.

300
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,960
And one, two, three, touch.

301
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:16,000
One, two, three, kick.

302
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:20,800
Back, side, front, kick.
Back, side, front...

303
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,200
Okay. This is really good.
Very good there.

304
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,040
<i>Now I'm glad to say</i>

305
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,960
<i>I'm his bride to be</i>

306
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:35,920
<i>And we're gonna raise a family</i>

307
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,840
Donald, are you feeling ill?
- No.

308
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,360
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

309
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:18,600
- Are you all right?
- I just want to go home.

310
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,680
- Good afternoon, Sister.
- Good afternoon, Sister James.

311
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,920
Sister, can I speak with you
about Donald Miller?

312
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:51,880
Is he being accepted?
He has no friends.

313
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,560
That would be a lot
to expect after only two months.

314
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,720
- Has anyone hit him?
- No.

315
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,080
Someone will.

316
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:09,000
And when that happens,
send them right down to me.

317
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,680
I'm not so sure anyone will.

318
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,120
This parish serves Irish
and Italian families.

319
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,520
Someone will hit Donald Miller.

320
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,680
He has a protector.

321
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,360
Who?

322
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,680
Father Flynn.

323
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,040
What?

324
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,680
He's taken an interest.

325
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:04,680
I told you to come to me,
but I hoped you never would.

326
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,240
Maybe I shouldn't have.

327
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,000
So, it's happened.

328
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:18,120
What? Oh, no. I'm not telling you that.
I'm not even certain what you mean.

329
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,480
Oh, excuse me there, Sisters.

330
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,320
No bother. We're done here.
Come, Sister.

331
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,480
What have you seen?

332
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,960
It is unsettling
to look at people with suspicion.

333
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,600
I feel less close to God.

334
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,720
When you take a step
to address wrongdoing,

335
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:46,920
you are taking a step away from God,
but in his service.

336
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,400
What have you seen?

337
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,000
Good afternoon, Sisters.

338
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,720
Good afternoon, Mrs. Carson.
Why the cat?

339
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,320
'Cause there's a mouse.
Want some tea?

340
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,200
If you don't want to dance with her,
don't dance with her.

341
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,200
- Well, is it wrong?
- No.

342
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,760
But what if the girl turns you down?

343
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,800
All right, you have the right
to ask a girl to dance.

344
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,520
All right,
she has the right to turn you down.

345
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,920
The trick is, don't take it to heart.

346
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,280
What if they all turn you down?

347
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,640
Well, then you become a priest.

348
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,480
All right, next question.

349
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,280
What have you seen?

350
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,640
He called Donald Miller to the rectory.

351
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,360
- What for?
- A talk.

352
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,480
- Alone?
- Yes.

353
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,440
- When?
- A week ago during class.

354
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,080
Why didn't you tell me?

355
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,280
I didn't think
there was anything wrong with it.

356
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:07,240
Of all the children, Donald Miller.

357
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,280
I suppose it makes sense.

358
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,400
- How does it make sense?
- He's isolated.

359
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:17,480
- I don't know that anything is wrong.
- Our first Negro student.

360
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:21,800
I thought there would be fighting.
Thought we...

361
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,520
A parent or two to deal with.

362
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,920
I should have foreseen this possibility.

363
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,120
How could you imagine it?

364
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:36,800
Well, it's my job
to outshine the fox in cleverness.

365
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,920
- That is my job.
- But maybe it's nothing.

366
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,080
Then why do you look like
you've seen the devil?

367
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,880
It's just the way the boy acted
when he came back to class.

368
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,880
- He said something?
- No, it was his expression.

369
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,760
He looked frightened.

370
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:06,000
And he put his head on the desk
in the most peculiar way, and...

371
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,920
And one other thing,
I think there was alcohol on his breath.

372
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:21,920
There was alcohol on his breath.

373
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,480
Years ago at Saint Boniface
there was a priest.

374
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,400
But I had Father Scully then.

375
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,480
Here, there's no man I can go to.
Men run everything.

376
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,440
We are going to have to
stop him ourselves.

377
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,080
There we go. She got him. Takes a cat.

378
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,840
Yes, it does.

379
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,240
Yes, it does.

380
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,480
This towel
will never be dead white again.

381
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,880
Yes, it will.

382
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,320
Mrs. Carson.
I'm fine.

383
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,320
- What happened?
- There's a branch down.

384
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,200
- Are you all right, Sister?
She didn't see it.

385
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:12,240
Fine. Just bushwhacked.
No need for a fuss.

386
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,200
You just go lie down.
I'll bring you some tea.

387
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,040
Come with me.
I just...

388
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,880
I'll get you a compress.
- I did not fail to see it.

389
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,520
<i>- MR. McGUINN: Hello? Yes, Sister.
- Mr. McGuinn.</i>

390
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:24,480
Could you look in on the courtyard?
I've got branches falling.

391
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,680
<i>- What has?
- A branch has!</i>

392
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:35,560
Watch your step here, Sister.
I'll cut it up.

393
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,080
The world is crashing, Michael.

394
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:43,360
I haven't heard a wind like that
since I left Mullingar.

395
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:46,880
I've never known a wind like it.
The wind has changed.

396
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,560
What are you doing out here, Conroy?

397
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,560
I talked in class, Father.

398
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,440
Waiting for Sister Aloysius.

399
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,840
- She know you're here?
- She knows.

400
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,160
Good morning, Father Flynn.
Good of you to come by.

401
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,160
Morning, Sister Aloysius.
How are you today?

402
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,360
I'm very well, thank you.

403
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,480
- Mr. Conroy.
- Yes, Sister.

404
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,400
Mr. Transistor Radio.

405
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,160
Multiplication table, 10 times,
in its totality,

406
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,000
delivered to me tomorrow morning.

407
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,360
Legible, boy.

408
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:59,280
Return to class. Go. Go, go.

409
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,880
I'd invite you in,
but we're just short Sister James.

410
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,240
- Hear that wind last night?
- I certainly did.

411
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:25,920
Oh.

412
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,920
Did I hear
Sister Veronica had an accident?

413
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:31,440
Yeah. Sister Veronica fell,
practically killed herself.

414
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,880
- Is she all right?
- Oh, she's fine.

415
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:40,800
- Her sight isn't good, is it?
- Her sight is fine. Nuns fall, you know.

416
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,800
Nah, I didn't know that.

417
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,280
It's the habit.
It catches us up more often than not.

418
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,360
Hmm.

419
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,400
We go down like dominoes.

420
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,040
- Am I past the time?
- Not at all.

421
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,640
Good morning, Father.
Good morning, Sister.

422
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,800
I'm sorry I was delayed.

423
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:01,520
- I ran into Sister Veronica.
- How is she?

424
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:04,240
I'm afraid
she has a bit of a bloody nose.

425
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:07,320
I'm beginning to think
you're punching people.

426
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,960
Sister?

427
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,760
First, William London and now...

428
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,680
- Never mind. Well, come in, please.
- Sister.

429
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:25,480
Please. Sit. Have a seat.

430
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,280
I actually have a hot pot of tea.

431
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:31,280
And close this,
but not quite for form's sake.

432
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,400
Father, would you care for a...

433
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,280
- Would you have a cup of tea, Father?
- I'd love a cup of tea.

434
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,920
- Sister, perhaps you could serve him.
- I'd be glad.

435
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,280
And yourself, of course.

436
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,520
Would you like a cup of tea,
Sister Aloysius?

437
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,280
No, I've already had my cup.

438
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,720
- Is there sugar?
- Sugar?

439
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:59,040
Yes, yes. Somewhere here.

440
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:04,760
I put it in the drawer for Lent last year.
Never remembered to take it out.

441
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,760
It mustn't have been much
to give up, then.

442
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:12,080
I'm sure you're right.
Here it is.

443
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:18,520
I'll serve you, although
for want of practice I'm a little clumsy.

444
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:24,960
- I see your fingernails.
- Wear them a little long.

445
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,200
- The sugar?
- Yes. One?

446
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,440
Three.

447
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,240
- Three?
- Sweet tooth.

448
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:35,640
Two. Three.

449
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,680
- Sister, you care for sugar?
- Never.

450
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,640
Not that there's
anything wrong with sugar.

451
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,720
Well, thank you, Father,
for making time for us.

452
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,440
We are at our wit's end.

453
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:52,480
I think it's an excellent idea
to rethink the Christmas pageant,

454
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,520
'cause last year's effort
was a little woebegone.

455
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:59,360
Oh, I loved it, but I love all pageants.
The hymns.

456
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,720
<i>O Little Town of Bethlehem, O Come,
O Come, Emmanuel, O Come...</i>

457
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,040
All right.
Thank you, Sister James.

458
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,160
So what do you think, Father?

459
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,520
Is there something new we could do?

460
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,000
Well, we all love the Christmas hymns,

461
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:14,640
but it might be jolly
to include a secular song.

462
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,880
- Secular?
- Yes.

463
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,960
<i>It's Beginning To Look A Lot
Like Christmas. Something like that.</i>

464
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:23,480
What would be
the point of a secular song?

465
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,720
Just fun.

466
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,840
<i>- Or Frosty the Snowman.
That's a good one.</i>

467
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:31,040
We could have one of the boys
dress up as a snowman, dance around.

468
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,120
Which boy?

469
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,400
We'd do tryouts.

470
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:42,880
<i>Frosty the Snowman
espouses a pagan belief in magic.</i>

471
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,840
The snowman comes to life when
an enchanted hat is put on his head.

472
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,360
If the music were more somber,

473
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:53,400
people would realize the images
are disturbing and the song heretical.

474
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,720
<i>I never thought about
Frosty the Snowman like that.</i>

475
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,920
It should be banned from the airwaves.

476
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,160
<i>So, not Frosty the Snowman.</i>

477
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:05,920
<i>Oh, It's Beginning To Look A Lot Like
Christmas would be fine, I suppose.</i>

478
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,880
Parents would like it.

479
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:13,880
May I ask what you're writing down
with that ballpoint pen?

480
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,200
Oh, nothing. It's an idea for a sermon.

481
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:21,120
- Oh. You had one right now?
- I get them all the time.

482
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,920
How fortunate.

483
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,320
I forget them,
so I have to write them down.

484
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,320
Oh.

485
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,480
What is the idea?

486
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,920
Intolerance.

487
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,960
Would you like
a little more tea, Father?

488
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,320
Not yet.

489
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,000
It's a new time, Sister.

490
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:47,160
- What's new about it?
- Something inside of people is new.

491
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,720
There is nothing new under the sun.

492
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,840
The Church needs to change.

493
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:58,520
We should sing a song
from the radio now and then,

494
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,240
take the kids out for ice cream.

495
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,480
Sweet tooth.

496
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:04,440
And maybe take the boys
on a camping trip.

497
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,120
The point being?

498
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,280
We should be friendlier.

499
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,800
You know, the children and the parents

500
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,040
should see us
as members of their family.

501
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:18,680
But we are not members of their family.
We're different.

502
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:23,560
- Why? Because of our vows?
- Precisely.

503
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:27,120
I don't think we're so different.

504
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,880
You know, Sister,
I would take some more tea.

505
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,920
And they think we're different, yeah?

506
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,560
The working...

507
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:38,880
The working class people of this parish
trust us to be different.

508
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,440
I think we're getting off the subject.

509
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,120
Yes, you're right. You're right.
You're right. Back to it.

510
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,400
Yes?

511
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,560
Sister Raymond? Mmm.

512
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:58,080
Well, you tell her to wash her face
and her neck and report to me at 3:00.

513
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,280
Yeah.

514
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:04,320
Excuse me. The Christmas pageant.

515
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,320
We must be careful

516
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,840
how Donald Miller is used
in the pageant.

517
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,000
- Easy there, Sister.
- Father.

518
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,280
All right, what about Donald Miller?

519
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,480
We must be careful, in the pageant,

520
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:25,440
that we neither hide Donald Miller
nor put him forward.

521
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:31,840
- Because of the color of his skin?
- That's right, yeah.

522
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:35,360
- Why?
- Oh, come, Father.

523
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:38,640
I think he should be treated
like every other boy.

524
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:43,720
Well, you yourself singled the boy out
for special attention.

525
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:51,360
You held a private meeting with him
at the rectory. A week ago?

526
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:52,520
Yes.

527
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:59,720
- What are we talking about?
- Donald Miller.

528
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:06,960
The boy acted strangely
when he returned to class.

529
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:09,720
He did?

530
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:13,160
When he returned from the rectory,
a little odd, yes.

531
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,560
Can you tell us why?

532
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,680
How did he act strangely?

533
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,360
He...

534
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:27,280
I'm not sure how to explain it.
He laid his head on the desk and...

535
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:32,600
Do you mean
you had some impression?

536
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:33,720
Yes.

537
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:36,200
And he'd come from the rectory,
so you're asking me?

538
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:37,600
Mmm. That's it.

539
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:39,520
Hmm.

540
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:40,760
Mmm.

541
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:42,320
Mmm.

542
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:45,800
Did you want to discuss the pageant?
Is that why I'm here?

543
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,720
Or is this what you wanted to discuss?

544
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:49,600
This.

545
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:53,920
Well, I'm a little uncomfortable.

546
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:56,720
Why?
- Why do you think?

547
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:59,040
The boy's well-being
is my responsibility.

548
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:02,320
His well-being is not at issue.

549
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:05,640
I'm not satisfied
that that is true.

550
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,760
He was upset
when he returned to class.

551
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,520
- Did he say something?
- No.

552
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,080
What happened in the rectory?

553
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,600
Happened?

554
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:18,720
Mmm.

555
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,320
Nothing happened.
I had a talk with the boy.

556
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:22,800
- What about?
- Private matter.

557
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,840
He's 12 years old.
What could be private?

558
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:29,920
- Should I get...
No.

559
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:33,160
I object to your tone.

560
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:39,560
This is not about my tone
or your tone, Father Flynn.

561
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:45,040
- It's about arriving at the truth.
- Of what?

562
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:50,760
You know what I'm talking about,
don't you? Hmm?

563
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:55,440
And you're controlling the expression
on your face right now, aren't you?

564
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:56,840
My face?

565
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:00,840
What exactly are you accusing me of?

566
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,440
I'm not accusing you of anything,
Father Flynn.

567
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:08,920
I am asking you to tell me
what happened in the rectory.

568
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:17,480
I don't wish to continue this.

569
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:19,800
And if you're dissatisfied with that,

570
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,800
I suggest
you speak to Monsignor Benedict.

571
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:28,000
I can only imagine this unfortunate
behavior is the result of overwork.

572
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:32,040
Have a good morning, Sister. Sister.

573
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:41,120
There was alcohol on his breath

574
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,840
when he returned
from his meeting with you.

575
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:50,880
Alcohol?

576
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,880
I did smell it on his breath.

577
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,320
Well?

578
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:07,280
- Let this alone.
- No.

579
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:19,840
Take your time, Father.
Would you like some more tea?

580
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,240
You should've let it alone.

581
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:26,520
Not possible.

582
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:37,400
Mr. McGuinn caught Donald
drinking altar wine.

583
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:44,480
When I found out, I sent for him.
There were tears,

584
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:50,120
and he begged not to be removed
from the altar boys. I took pity on him.

585
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:54,560
I told him if no one else found out,
I'd let him stay on.

586
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:58,320
What a relief. That explains everything.
Thanks be to God.

587
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:01,280
Look, Sister, it was all a mistake.

588
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:07,440
And if I talk to Mr. McGuinn?

589
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:09,640
Talk to him, by all means.

590
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:10,800
But now that the boy's secret's out,

591
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:12,560
I'm gonna have to remove him
from the altar boys.

592
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:14,040
That's what I was trying to avoid.

593
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,560
You were trying
to protect the boy.

594
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,440
That's right.

595
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,960
I might have done the same thing.

596
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:22,560
Is there a way Donald could stay
on the altar boys?

597
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:26,520
If the boy drank altar wine,
he can't continue as an altar boy.

598
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:27,960
Of course.

599
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:32,040
Are you satisfied?

600
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:33,680
Yes.

601
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:37,680
Hmm.

602
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:41,160
Well, I'll be going.
I have some writing to do.

603
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,520
Intolerance.
- That's right.

604
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:49,880
I'm not pleased
with how you handled this.

605
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:52,480
Sister. Sister.

606
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:02,120
Well...

607
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:06,720
What a relief. He cleared it all up.

608
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:11,240
You believe him?

609
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:14,640
Of course.

610
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,560
Isn't it that it's easier to believe him?

611
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:22,000
But we can corroborate his story
with Mr. McGuinn.

612
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:23,240
Mmm-hmm.

613
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,080
Yes.

614
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:29,080
These types of people are clever.

615
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,640
- Well, I'm convinced.
- You're not.

616
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:40,320
You just want things to be resolved
so you can have simplicity back.

617
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:43,520
I want no further part of this.

618
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,720
I'll bring him down.

619
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:51,120
How can you be so sure
that he is lying?

620
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:56,240
Experience.

621
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,680
You just don't like him.

622
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:04,600
You don't like it
that he uses a ballpoint pen.

623
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:08,080
You don't like it that he takes
three lumps of sugar in his tea.

624
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,240
<i>You don't like it
that he likes Frosty the Snowman,</i>

625
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:14,920
and you are letting that convince you
of something terrible, just terrible.

626
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:18,640
<i>Well, I like Frosty the Snowman!</i>

627
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:21,560
And I think it would be nice
if this school weren't run like a jail,

628
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,880
and I think it's a good thing
that I love to teach history

629
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
and that I might inspire my students
to love it, too.

630
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:28,960
And if you judge that to mean
that I am not fit to be a teacher,

631
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:30,520
then so be it!

632
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:35,360
Sit down.

633
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:47,640
Look at that. You blew out my light.

634
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:56,160
In ancient Sparta, important matters
were decided by who shouted loudest.

635
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:59,080
Fortunately,
we are not in ancient Sparta.

636
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,040
You honestly find the students
in this school

637
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:10,760
to be treated like inmates in a prison?

638
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:12,960
No.

639
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:18,560
Actually, they all seem fairly happy,
but they're all uniformly terrified of you.

640
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:23,120
Yes. That's how it works.

641
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:26,000
Sit there.

642
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:43,080
Hello, this is Sister Aloysius Beauvier,

643
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:46,640
principal at St. Nicholas School.
Is this Mrs. Miller?

644
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:51,200
I'm calling about your son, Donald.

645
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:08,600
<i>A woman was gossiping with
a friend about a man she hardly knew.</i>

646
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:10,800
<i>I know none of you
have ever done this.</i>

647
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,880
<i>That night she had a dream.</i>

648
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:19,480
<i>A great hand appeared over her
and pointed down at her.</i>

649
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:25,200
<i>She was immediately seized
with an overwhelming sense of guilt.</i>

650
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,680
<i>The next day she went to confession.</i>

651
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,560
<i>She got the old parish priest,
Father O'Rourke.</i>

652
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:34,960
<i>She told him the whole thing.</i>

653
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:39,000
<i>"Is gossiping a sin?"
She asked the old man.</i>

654
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:44,080
<i>"Was that the hand of God Almighty
pointing a finger at me?</i>

655
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:46,720
<i>"Should I be
asking your absolution, Father?</i>

656
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:49,720
<i>"Tell me,
have I done something wrong?"</i>

657
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:53,880
<i>"Yes. " Father O'Rourke answered her.</i>

658
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,800
<i>"Yes, you ignorant,
badly brought up female.</i>

659
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:01,600
<i>"You have borne false witness
against your neighbor.</i>

660
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:04,480
<i>"You have played fast and loose
with his reputation,</i>

661
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:07,120
<i>"and you should be heartily ashamed!"</i>

662
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:13,440
<i>So the woman said she was sorry
and asked for forgiveness.</i>

663
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:17,040
<i>"Not so fast," says O'Rourke.</i>

664
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:22,160
<i>"I want you to go home.
Take a pillow up on your roof,</i>

665
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:25,880
<i>"cut it open with a knife,
and return here to me. "</i>

666
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:31,160
<i>So the woman went home,
took a pillow off her bed,</i>

667
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:33,160
<i>a knife from the drawer,</i>

668
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:36,960
<i>went up the fire escape to her roof
and stabbed the pillow.</i>

669
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:40,520
<i>Then she went back
to the old parish priest as instructed.</i>

670
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:44,520
<i>"Did you gut the pillow with a knife?"
He says.</i>

671
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:47,960
<i>"Yes, Father. "
"And what was the result?"</i>

672
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:51,760
<i>"Feathers," she said.</i>

673
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:57,640
<i>"Feathers," he repeated.</i>

674
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:03,080
<i>"Feathers everywhere, Father. "</i>

675
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:08,720
<i>"Now, I want you to go back</i>

676
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:12,560
<i>"and gather up every last feather
that flew out on the wind. "</i>

677
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:17,400
<i>"Well, " she said, "it can't be done.</i>

678
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:22,120
<i>"I don't know where they went.
The wind took them all over. "</i>

679
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:28,120
<i>"And that," said Father O'Rourke,
"is gossip!"</i>

680
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:34,440
<i>In the name of the Father, the Son
and the Holy Ghost. Amen.</i>

681
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:40,120
<i>Please rise.</i>

682
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:13,480
What's that bird complaining about?

683
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:17,720
What kind of bird is that?

684
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:20,600
That a starling? A grackle?

685
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:26,160
- A crow.
- Course it is.

686
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:29,600
Are you praying?
I didn't mean to interrupt.

687
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:31,480
I'm not praying. No.

688
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,040
You seem subdued.

689
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:38,920
Oh, I can't sleep.

690
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:41,360
Why not?

691
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:44,560
Bad dreams.

692
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,320
Yeah, I can't sleep on occasion.

693
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:51,840
Why? Do you see that big hand
pointing a finger at you?

694
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:53,760
Yes. Sometimes.

695
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:00,120
Was your sermon
directed at anyone in particular?

696
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:03,000
What do you think?

697
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:18,600
I received a letter
from my brother in Maryland.

698
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,120
He's very sick.

699
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,200
Then maybe you should go
and see him.

700
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:27,240
I can't leave my class.

701
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:37,280
Is it true?

702
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:40,440
What?

703
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,920
You know what I'm asking.

704
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:47,080
No.

705
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:53,520
I saw you put an undershirt
in Donald Miller's locker.

706
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:59,640
- He left it in the sacristy.
- Why didn't you hand it to him?

707
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:06,160
I'm trying to spare him
further embarrassment.

708
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:24,320
It's me that cares about that child,
not her.

709
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:28,040
Has she ever reached out a hand?

710
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:33,280
That black boy needs help
or he's not gonna make it.

711
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:35,440
If she has her way,
he'll be left to his own undoing.

712
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:38,880
Why do you think he drank the wine?
He's in trouble.

713
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:44,200
And she sees me talk
in a human way to these kids

714
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:48,400
and she immediately assumes that
there must be something wrong with it.

715
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:52,240
Well, I'm not gonna let her
keep this parish in the Dark Ages,

716
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:55,680
and I'm not gonna let her
destroy my spirit of compassion.

717
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:57,280
I'm sure that's not her intent.

718
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:01,000
- That I care about this congregation.
- I know you do.

719
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:05,560
Like you care about your class.
You love them, don't you?

720
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:09,080
- Yes.
- And that's natural.

721
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:12,400
How else would you relate to children?

722
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:18,560
Now, I can look at your face
and know your philosophy.

723
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:20,560
It's kindness.

724
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:24,320
I don't know. I mean, of course.

725
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:29,840
There are people
who go after your humanity, Sister,

726
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:32,920
that tell you that
the light in your heart is a weakness.

727
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:34,680
Don't believe it.

728
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:40,640
It's an old tactic of cruel people
to kill kindness in the name of virtue.

729
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:45,280
There's nothing wrong with love.

730
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:49,040
Love?

731
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:53,840
Have you forgotten the message
of our Savior?

732
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:57,040
It's love of people.

733
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:08,960
I just feel
as if everything is upside down.

734
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:17,760
There are just times in life
when we feel lost. It happens.

735
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:22,200
And it's a bond.

736
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:29,040
- Flowers.
- Yeah.

737
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:31,440
To remind me of spring.

738
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:42,200
I should be going.

739
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,400
I'm sorry your brother's ill.

740
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:50,840
Thank you, Father.

741
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:58,360
I don't believe it.

742
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:01,680
You don't?

743
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:04,800
No.

744
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:08,960
Thank you, Sister.
Thank you very much.

745
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:21,440
Hey, Anthony!
That's not funny.

746
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:23,840
That's also the day
that I tripped. I broke my ankle.

747
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:24,960
I barely...

748
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:28,240
Father. I think
I've just gotta tell somebody.

749
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:30,520
- Hello, Noreen.
- I'm in love.

750
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:33,440
That's wonderful. Who's the lucky boy?

751
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:36,000
- Jimmy Hurley.
- Have you told him?

752
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:38,160
For life and death,
I'd go for waffles.

753
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:39,920
Maybe you should.

754
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:42,280
Maybe I will, Father.

755
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:45,000
Jimmy!

756
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:47,200
Jimmy Hurley?

757
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:50,320
Come over here!

758
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:54,760
Hurry up, already!

759
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:56,640
Father Sherman.

760
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:00,240
Jimmy,
I just gotta tell you something.

761
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:07,400
You dropped something.

762
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:09,680
It's not funny.

763
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:10,920
Get out of the way.

764
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:26,080
It's all right.

765
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:29,680
He doesn't like me.
That is so easy!

766
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:35,840
My parents are gonna be
so angry at me.

767
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:46,120
Okay. Be quiet.

768
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:50,920
I said be quiet!

769
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:56,000
The next one of you that speaks out
of turn gets sent right to the principal.

770
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:57,960
Now the question was,

771
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:01,400
what was
Patrick Henry's famous remark?

772
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:07,280
- Donald.
- Sister?

773
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:13,960
What was the question?

774
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:18,240
Nobody help him.
Jimmy, put your hand down.

775
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:21,080
Donald Miller, stand up.

776
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:29,760
- What was the question, Donald?
- I don't know, Sister.

777
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:33,520
It means you weren't listening.

778
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:35,360
Yes, Sister.

779
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:39,680
The question was, what was
Patrick Henry's famous remark?

780
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:45,000
I don't know.

781
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:46,440
"Give me liberty or give me death!"

782
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:49,200
James Hurley,
down to the principal's office.

783
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:50,400
Now!

784
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:15,680
- Mrs. Miller?
- Yes.

785
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:17,040
Come in.

786
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:20,680
Please, have a seat.

787
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:27,000
I was changing a bulb.

788
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:30,440
Thought I mighta had the wrong day.
You didn't answer.

789
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:31,480
Huh?

790
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:34,760
Oh, well, just between us,

791
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:39,760
I was listening to a transistor radio
with an earpiece.

792
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:42,000
Look how tiny they're making them.

793
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:44,080
I confiscated it
from one of the students,

794
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:45,840
now I can't stop listening to it.

795
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:48,240
You like music?

796
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:52,320
No. News reports.

797
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:55,280
Years ago I used to listen
to all the news reports,

798
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:58,360
because my husband was in Italy,
in the war.

799
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:01,200
- You were a married woman?
- Yes.

800
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:04,080
But then he was killed.

801
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:06,600
Is your husband coming?

802
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:09,280
Couldn't get off work.
I only have half an hour myself.

803
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:12,280
I see. Of course. It was a lot to ask.

804
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:23,120
How's Donald doing?

805
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:27,000
He's passing his subjects.
He has average grades.

806
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:29,440
Oh. Good.

807
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:32,600
He was upset about getting taken off
the altar boys.

808
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:34,840
Mmm. Did he explain why?

809
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:37,680
He said he was caught
drinking altar wine.

810
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:39,560
That is the reason.

811
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:42,640
Well, that seems fair.

812
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:45,880
But he's a good boy, Sister.
He fell down there,

813
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:48,560
but he's a good boy
pretty much down the line.

814
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:50,360
How is he at home?

815
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:54,320
His father beat the hell out of him
over that wine.

816
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:55,760
Oh, he shouldn't do that.

817
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:59,520
You don't tell my husband what to do.
You just stand back.

818
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:03,200
My husband didn't want Donald
to come here.

819
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:05,360
- Why?
- He thought he'd have trouble

820
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:08,600
with the other boys,
but that hasn't really happened.

821
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:09,880
Good.

822
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:13,600
That priest, Father Flynn,
been watching out for him.

823
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:16,960
Yes.

824
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,400
Excuse me.

825
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:36,000
James Hurley,
what are you doing out of class?

826
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:38,080
- Sister James sent me down.
- What for?

827
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:40,920
- Talking.
- Well, go back up and shut up!

828
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:43,440
Go! Go!

829
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:49,280
What's going on?

830
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:57,240
None of your business.
Now go on. Go back to class.

831
01:05:58,120 --> 01:05:59,480
Bullshit.

832
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:01,600
- What'd you say?
- Nothing!

833
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:09,400
You have 20 minutes, you say?

834
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:13,520
It's just that I have to walk to work.

835
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:15,920
- Where is work?
- Parkchester.

836
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:19,240
If I don't start cleaning by noon,
I'm not home to let Donald in.

837
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:22,400
- May I walk with you?
- I don't mind.

838
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:27,200
Eight sixty-fourths.

839
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:31,200
Who can tell me
what the common denominator is?

840
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:32,560
Nobody?

841
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:36,560
Back already, Mr. Hurley?

842
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:40,520
- I said, back already, Mr. Hurley?
- Leave me alone!

843
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:43,200
Who do you think you're talking to?

844
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:46,680
This is my classroom, boy!
Don't you forget that.

845
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:52,160
I'm sorry.

846
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:00,960
I'm sorry, Jimmy.

847
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:06,720
Have you met
Father Flynn?

848
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:09,200
Just seen him on the altar.
Haven't met him face to face.

849
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:11,640
No, just, you know, heard from Donald.

850
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:13,040
And what does he say?

851
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:15,680
You know,
"Father Flynn, Father Flynn. "

852
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:18,400
He looks up to him. Man gives him
his time, which is what the boy needs.

853
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:20,000
He needs that.

854
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:23,120
Mrs. Miller, we may have a problem.

855
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:26,160
I thought there must a been a reason
you wanting to see me.

856
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:28,120
Principal's a big job.

857
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:32,000
I just want to say though,
it's just till June.

858
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:33,480
Excuse me?

859
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:38,840
Whatever the problem is,
Donald just has to make it till June.

860
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:41,200
Then he's off into high school.

861
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:42,480
Right.

862
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:44,840
If Donald can graduate
from St. Nicholas,

863
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:47,600
he has a better chance
of getting into a good high school,

864
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:50,720
and that would mean
an opportunity at college.

865
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:53,280
I don't see anything at this time

866
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:56,800
standing in the way
of his graduating with his class.

867
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:00,800
- Well, that's all I care about.
- I doubt that.

868
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:02,560
Try me.

869
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:09,880
I am concerned about the relationship
between Father Flynn and your son.

870
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:13,440
You don't say. Concerned.
What do you mean, concerned?

871
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:15,520
That it may not be right.

872
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:18,560
Well, there's something wrong
with everybody,

873
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:22,080
and their soul gotta be forgiven.
I work right there.

874
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:25,240
I am concerned, to be frank,

875
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:32,120
that Father Flynn may have made
advances on your son.

876
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:37,720
May have made?

877
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:40,160
I can't be certain.

878
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:42,000
- No evidence?
- No.

879
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:45,520
Then maybe there's nothing to it.

880
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:55,120
I think there is something to it.

881
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:58,360
I think Father Flynn
gave Donald that altar wine.

882
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:00,280
Why would he do that?

883
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:06,560
- Has Donald been acting strangely?
- No.

884
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:09,000
- Nothing out of the ordinary?
- He's been himself.

885
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:11,680
- All right.
- Look, Sister, I don't want any trouble.

886
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:14,000
I don't... I'm not sure
you completely understand.

887
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:15,960
I think I understand
the kind of thing you're talking about,

888
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:18,560
but I don't want to get into it.

889
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:20,080
What's that?

890
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:24,880
Look, I only have a few minutes.
Not to be disagreeing,

891
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,680
but if we're talking about
something floating around

892
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:30,080
between this priest and my son,
it ain't my son's fault.

893
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:32,640
- I'm not suggesting that...
- He's just a boy.

894
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:33,920
- I know.
- Twelve years old.

895
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:35,520
If someone should be taking blame,
it should be the man...

896
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:37,600
- I know. I agree with you completely.
... not the boy.

897
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:38,880
You're agreeing with me,
but I got called

898
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:40,120
to the principal,
if you know what I'm saying.

899
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:43,480
I am concerned about Donald's welfare.

900
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:47,520
You honestly think that priest
gave Donald that wine to drink?

901
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:48,960
Yes, I do.

902
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:51,360
Then how come my son
got kicked off the altar boys

903
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:53,440
- if it was a man that gave it to him?
- I know.

904
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:56,000
The boy got caught, the man didn't.

905
01:09:58,600 --> 01:09:59,920
- So you're giving my son the blame.
- No.

906
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:00,960
No problem my son getting blamed,

907
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:02,880
- and you know why that is.
- Perhaps you should let me talk.

908
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
- I think you're getting upset.
- Sister, you ain't going against

909
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:06,360
no man in a robe and win.
He's got the position.

910
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:09,520
- And he's got your son.
- Let him have him then.

911
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:12,960
What?

912
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:16,840
It's just till June.

913
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:21,240
Do you know what you're saying?

914
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:24,400
Know more about it than you.

915
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:29,440
I believe this man is creating,

916
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:31,560
or may have already brought about,

917
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:34,000
an improper relationship with your son.

918
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:35,520
I don't know.

919
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:37,320
I know I am right.

920
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:41,360
Why you gotta know something
like that for sure when you don't?

921
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:44,600
What kind of mother are you?

922
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:51,040
Excuse me, but you don't know enough
about life to say a thing like that, Sister.

923
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:52,160
I know enough.

924
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:54,080
You know the rules maybe,
but that don't cover it.

925
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:55,960
I know what I won't accept.

926
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:58,080
You accept what you gotta accept,
and you work with it.

927
01:10:58,200 --> 01:10:59,240
This man is in my school.

928
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:00,400
Well, he's gotta be somewhere and

929
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:02,080
- maybe he's doing some good, too.
- He is after the boys!

930
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:05,360
Well, maybe some of them boys
want to get caught!

931
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:19,200
That's why his father beat him.

932
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:24,160
Not the wine.

933
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:34,040
What are you telling me?

934
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:40,880
I'm talking about the boy's nature now,

935
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:44,160
not anything he's done.

936
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:49,800
You can't hold a child responsible
for what God gave him to be.

937
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:55,240
I'm only interested in actions,
Mrs. Miller.

938
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:57,160
But then there's the boy's nature.

939
01:11:57,280 --> 01:12:00,240
- Leave that out of it.
- Well, forget it then.

940
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:04,520
You're the one
forcing people to say things.

941
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,120
My boy came to your school

942
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:12,640
'cause they were gonna kill him
in the public school.

943
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:17,240
His father don't like him.

944
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:20,680
He come to your school,
kids don't like him.

945
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:23,960
One man is good to him, this priest.

946
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:27,480
Then does a man
have his reasons, yes.

947
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:31,600
Everybody does.
You have your reasons,

948
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:35,760
but do I ask the man
why he's good to my son?

949
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:38,760
No.

950
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:44,080
I don't care why.

951
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:52,000
My son needs some man
to care about him

952
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:56,280
and to see him through
to where he wants to go.

953
01:12:56,720 --> 01:12:58,520
And thank God this educated man

954
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:01,480
with some kindness in him
wants to do just that.

955
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:04,160
- This will not do.
- It's just till June.

956
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:06,200
I'll throw your son out of this school.

957
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:08,400
And why would you do that
if it didn't start with him?

958
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:10,720
Because I will stop this.

959
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:12,520
You'd hurt my son to get your way?

960
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:15,400
- It won't end with your son.
- Throw the priest out then.

961
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:19,440
- I am trying to do just that.
- Then what do you want from me?

962
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:28,080
Nothing.

963
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:33,840
As it turns out.

964
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:37,640
Please leave my son
out of this.

965
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:48,840
My husband will kill that child
over a thing like this.

966
01:13:58,120 --> 01:13:59,440
I will try.

967
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:10,360
I'm late.

968
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,200
Sister,

969
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:19,840
I don't know if you and me
on the same side.

970
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:24,760
I'll be standing with my son
and those who are good with my son.

971
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:28,600
It'd be nice to see you there.
Good morning.

972
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:45,880
May I come in?

973
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:48,160
A third party would be required.

974
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:51,080
Yeah. What was Donald's mother
doing here?

975
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:54,160
- We were having a chat.
- About what?

976
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:55,680
A third party
would truly be required, Father.

977
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:57,480
No, Sister. No third party!

978
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:00,160
Me and you are due for a talk!

979
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:02,640
You have to stop
this campaign against me.

980
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:05,520
- You can stop it at any time.
- How?

981
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:06,720
Confess and resign.

982
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:09,040
You are attempting
to destroy my reputation!

983
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:12,240
Who keeps opening my window?

984
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:15,520
What are you doing in this school?

985
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:17,440
I'm trying to do good.

986
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:19,920
Even more to the point,

987
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:22,840
what are you doing in the priesthood?

988
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:27,000
You are single-handedly holding
this school and this parish back.

989
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:29,120
- From what?
- Progressive education

990
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:30,360
and a welcoming church.

991
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:32,520
You can't distract me, Father.

992
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:34,040
This is not about my behavior,
it's about yours.

993
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:36,080
No, this is about
your unfounded suspicions.

994
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:39,280
- That's right. I have suspicions.
- Just leave that. It's not important.

995
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:41,240
I will decide

996
01:16:44,120 --> 01:16:45,960
what's important.

997
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:48,720
Why do you suspect me?
What have I done?

998
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:53,840
You gave that boy wine,
and you let him take the blame.

999
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:56,760
That's completely untrue.
Did you talk to Mr. McGuinn?

1000
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:59,160
All McGuinn knows
is that the boy drank wine.

1001
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:01,360
He doesn't know
how he came to drink it.

1002
01:17:01,480 --> 01:17:03,600
Did his mother
have something to add to that?

1003
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:04,760
No.

1004
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:09,200
- So that's it.
- I am not satisfied.

1005
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:11,000
Ask the boy then.

1006
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:14,160
- He'd protect you.
- Why would he do that?

1007
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:18,000
- Because you have seduced him.
- You're insane.

1008
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:20,480
You've got it in your head
that I corrupted this child

1009
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:23,520
after giving him wine,
and nothing I say will change that.

1010
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:24,800
That's right.

1011
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:26,400
But this has nothing to do
with the wine.

1012
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:29,560
Not really. You've had a fundamental
mistrust of me before this incident.

1013
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:33,320
It was you that warned Sister James
to be on the lookout, wasn't it?

1014
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:34,640
That's true.

1015
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:36,880
- So you admit it!
- Certainly.

1016
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:39,520
Why?

1017
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:43,240
I know people.

1018
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:46,040
That's not good enough.

1019
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:48,840
- It won't have to be.
- How's that?

1020
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:51,480
You will tell me what you have done.

1021
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,720
Oh, I will.

1022
01:17:56,680 --> 01:17:58,000
Out again.

1023
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:02,120
Sister James is convinced I'm innocent.

1024
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:04,640
So you talked to Sister James.

1025
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:07,760
Well, of course
you talked to Sister James.

1026
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:09,840
Did you know
Donald's father beats him?

1027
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:11,040
Yes.

1028
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:14,160
And might that not account
for the odd behavior

1029
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:16,920
Sister James noticed in the boy?

1030
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:18,440
It might.

1031
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:20,440
Then what is it? What?

1032
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:23,400
What did you hear?

1033
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:26,720
What did you see
that convinced you so thoroughly?

1034
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:30,000
What does it matter?

1035
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:35,000
It matters! What does it matter?
I want to know!

1036
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:48,240
Out this window,

1037
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:52,960
I saw you grab William London's wrist,

1038
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:56,760
and I saw him pull away.

1039
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:13,920
- Are you serious?
- I am.

1040
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:16,960
That's all?

1041
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:20,320
Yeah. That was all.

1042
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:25,400
That's nothing.

1043
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:30,520
- What are you doing now?
- I'm writing down what you say.

1044
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:35,040
It might be important when I have
to explain why you have to be removed.

1045
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:43,680
This morning before I spoke
with Mrs. Miller,

1046
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:47,040
I took the precaution
of calling your last parish.

1047
01:19:47,720 --> 01:19:49,360
What did he say?

1048
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:51,840
- Who?
- The pastor.

1049
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:57,280
I did not speak to the pastor.
I spoke to a nun.

1050
01:19:58,280 --> 01:20:00,800
You should have spoken to the pastor.

1051
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:03,160
I spoke to a nun.

1052
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:05,600
You know that's not the proper route
for you to have taken, Sister.

1053
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:08,480
The church is very clear. You're
supposed to go through the pastor.

1054
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:11,360
Why? You have an understanding,
you and he?

1055
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:14,360
No, you have no right to go rummaging
through my past!

1056
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:16,160
You have a history.

1057
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:18,880
This is your third parish in five years.

1058
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,320
- Why?
- Call the pastor.

1059
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:23,040
Ask him why I left.
It's perfectly innocent.

1060
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:25,840
- I'm not calling the pastor.
- I'm a good priest.

1061
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:28,880
Go after another child and
another child, until you are stopped.

1062
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,360
- What nun did you speak to?
- I won't say.

1063
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:34,320
- Yeah, I've not touched a child.
- You have!

1064
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:37,120
You haven't the slightest proof
of anything.

1065
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:38,840
But I have my certainty.

1066
01:20:38,920 --> 01:20:40,960
And armed with that,
I'll go to your last parish

1067
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:43,960
and the one before that.
If necessary, I'll find a parent.

1068
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:46,400
Trust me, Father Flynn, I will.

1069
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:50,240
You have no right to act on your own!

1070
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:55,040
You have taken vows,
obedience being one!

1071
01:20:55,160 --> 01:20:56,880
You answer to us!

1072
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,840
You have no right
to step outside the church!

1073
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,360
I will step outside the church
if that's what needs to be done,

1074
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:05,200
though the door should shut
behind me!

1075
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:10,000
I will do what needs to be done,
though I'm damned to hell!

1076
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:14,440
You should understand that,
or you will mistake me.

1077
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:20,440
Now, did you give Donald Miller
wine to drink?

1078
01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:24,160
Have you never done anything wrong?

1079
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:26,880
- I have.
- No mortal sin?

1080
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:37,200
Yes.

1081
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:40,240
And?

1082
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:46,400
I confessed it, Father.

1083
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:51,120
Then whatever I have done,

1084
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:54,960
I have left in the healing hands
of my confessor.

1085
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:57,640
As have you.

1086
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:00,720
We are the same.

1087
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:06,040
Mmm-mmm.

1088
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:10,880
No, we are not. We are not the same.

1089
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:23,640
A dog that bites is a dog that bites.

1090
01:22:25,880 --> 01:22:28,680
Did you give Donald Miller
wine to drink?

1091
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:30,840
No.

1092
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:34,200
Mental reservations?

1093
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:36,440
No.

1094
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:40,720
You lie.

1095
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:45,760
Very well then.

1096
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:52,160
If you will not leave my office, I will.

1097
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:58,320
And once I go, I will not stop.

1098
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:05,360
Wait.

1099
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,680
I can't say everything, you understand?

1100
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:37,600
There's things I can't say,

1101
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:42,400
even if you can't imagine
the explanation, Sister.

1102
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:48,440
Remember, there are things
beyond your knowledge.

1103
01:23:50,120 --> 01:23:54,840
Even if you feel certainty,
it is an emotion, not a fact.

1104
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:01,440
You will request a transfer

1105
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:06,400
and take a leave of absence
until it's granted.

1106
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:10,960
You'd leave me nothing.

1107
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:14,200
It's Donald Miller who has nothing,

1108
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:17,240
and you took full advantage of that.

1109
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:21,080
I've done nothing wrong.
I care about that boy.

1110
01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:23,200
Why?

1111
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:28,600
'Cause you smile at him?

1112
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:31,760
And you sympathize with him?

1113
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:35,680
And you talk to him
as if you were the same?

1114
01:24:39,080 --> 01:24:41,440
You are a cheat.

1115
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:47,280
And that warm feeling you experienced

1116
01:24:48,120 --> 01:24:52,960
when that boy looked at you with trust
was not the sensation of virtue.

1117
01:24:54,360 --> 01:24:57,760
That could be got by any drunkard
with his tot of rum.

1118
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:01,520
I can fight you.

1119
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:03,640
You will lose.

1120
01:25:06,760 --> 01:25:08,640
Where's your compassion?

1121
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:13,120
Nowhere you can get at it.

1122
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:19,360
Stay here. Compose yourself.

1123
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,480
You can use the phone if you'd like.

1124
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:26,520
Good day, Father.

1125
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:39,520
I have no sympathy for you.

1126
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:44,960
I know you are invulnerable
to true regret.

1127
01:25:51,240 --> 01:25:52,960
And cut your nails.

1128
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:51,040
<i>Praise God,
from whom all blessings flow</i>

1129
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:56,240
<i>Praise him all creatures here below</i>

1130
01:26:56,960 --> 01:27:01,960
<i>Praise him above, ye heavenly host</i>

1131
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:08,240
<i>Praise Father, Son and Holy Ghost</i>

1132
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:14,320
<i>Amen</i>

1133
01:27:22,040 --> 01:27:24,160
<i>I never like to say goodbye,</i>

1134
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:32,000
<i>but there is a wind behind every one
of us that takes us through our lives.</i>

1135
01:27:34,240 --> 01:27:38,000
<i>We never see it. We can't command it.</i>

1136
01:27:39,400 --> 01:27:41,720
<i>We don't even know its purpose.</i>

1137
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:46,960
<i>'Cause I would have stayed
among you longer,</i>

1138
01:27:47,080 --> 01:27:49,400
<i>but that wind is taking me away.</i>

1139
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:56,400
<i>I will miss it here,</i>

1140
01:27:57,920 --> 01:27:59,680
<i>and I will miss you.</i>

1141
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:05,280
<i>But I'm content that the power
that propels me</i>

1142
01:28:06,440 --> 01:28:09,400
<i>does so with superior knowledge</i>

1143
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:12,480
<i>as to what is for the best,</i>

1144
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:16,600
<i>and that is my faith.</i>

1145
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:23,480
<i>I would like to come down now
among you</i>

1146
01:28:24,160 --> 01:28:25,760
<i>and say goodbye</i>

1147
01:28:27,240 --> 01:28:29,440
<i>and wish you peaceful hearts</i>

1148
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:31,760
<i>and loving hearts.</i>

1149
01:28:42,360 --> 01:28:44,120
- Goodbye, Senator.
- Father.

1150
01:28:45,160 --> 01:28:46,800
Carol. Thank you so much.
Thank you.

1151
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:48,480
Bless you, Father.

1152
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:52,080
- Happy holidays. Susan. Bless you.
- Thank you, Father.

1153
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:54,640
- Father.
- Thank you.

1154
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:57,080
Be good. Thank you.

1155
01:28:57,160 --> 01:29:00,960
- Thank you, Father.
- Thank you very much. Thank you.

1156
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:06,400
Paul. Thank you so much.

1157
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:09,960
God bless you. Goodbye.

1158
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:50,560
<i>...a midnight clear</i>

1159
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:54,640
<i>A glorious song of old</i>

1160
01:29:55,160 --> 01:29:59,520
<i>From angels bending near the Earth</i>

1161
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:25,360
Sister James. Welcome back.

1162
01:30:25,480 --> 01:30:26,800
Thank you, Sister.

1163
01:30:26,920 --> 01:30:29,440
You were missed. How is your brother?

1164
01:30:30,080 --> 01:30:31,680
Better. Much better.

1165
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:34,720
I'm very glad. I prayed for him.

1166
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:39,040
It was good to get away.
I needed to see my family.

1167
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:42,400
Mmm. Then I'm glad you did it.

1168
01:30:45,720 --> 01:30:47,680
And Father Flynn is gone?

1169
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:50,080
Yes.

1170
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,200
So you did it. You got him out.

1171
01:30:55,960 --> 01:30:56,960
Yes.

1172
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:02,080
Donald Miller is heartbroken.

1173
01:31:02,200 --> 01:31:05,960
Can't be helped. It's just till June.

1174
01:31:09,880 --> 01:31:12,880
I don't think Father Flynn
did anything wrong.

1175
01:31:13,480 --> 01:31:15,600
No? He convinced you?

1176
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:17,800
- Yes, he did.
- Mmm.

1177
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:25,280
Did you ever prove it?

1178
01:31:26,520 --> 01:31:29,920
- To whom?
- Anyone but yourself?

1179
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:32,320
Nope.

1180
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:35,200
- But you were sure?
- Yes.

1181
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:41,680
I wish I could be like you.

1182
01:31:43,680 --> 01:31:44,720
Why?

1183
01:31:46,280 --> 01:31:48,480
Because I can't sleep anymore.

1184
01:31:52,040 --> 01:31:55,640
Maybe we're not supposed to
sleep so well.

1185
01:31:58,280 --> 01:32:01,360
They made Father Flynn
pastor of Saint Jerome.

1186
01:32:03,720 --> 01:32:06,640
- Who?
- The bishop.

1187
01:32:09,640 --> 01:32:14,160
Appointed Father Flynn pastor
of Saint Jerome Church and School.

1188
01:32:15,680 --> 01:32:17,280
It's a promotion.

1189
01:32:18,680 --> 01:32:20,240
You didn't tell them?

1190
01:32:20,360 --> 01:32:25,000
Oh, I told our good monsignor.
I crossed the garden, and I told him.

1191
01:32:28,360 --> 01:32:30,800
He did not believe it to be true.

1192
01:32:34,520 --> 01:32:37,080
Then why did Father Flynn go?

1193
01:32:37,160 --> 01:32:39,680
What did you say to make him leave?

1194
01:32:40,280 --> 01:32:43,360
That I had called a nun
in his previous parish,

1195
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:49,200
that I had found out
his prior history of infringements.

1196
01:32:54,280 --> 01:32:56,000
So you did prove it?

1197
01:33:00,360 --> 01:33:02,080
I made no such call.

1198
01:33:06,120 --> 01:33:08,880
- You lied?
- Yes.

1199
01:33:10,120 --> 01:33:14,680
But if he'd had no such history,
the lie wouldn't have worked.

1200
01:33:18,080 --> 01:33:20,560
His resignation was his confession.

1201
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:27,680
He was what I thought he was.

1202
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:32,080
And he's gone.

1203
01:33:36,760 --> 01:33:38,720
I can't believe you lied.

1204
01:33:44,360 --> 01:33:46,520
In the pursuit of wrongdoing,

1205
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:49,880
one steps away from God.

1206
01:33:53,440 --> 01:33:55,600
Of course, there is a price.

1207
01:34:03,800 --> 01:34:04,920
I see.

1208
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:14,440
Oh.

1209
01:34:15,080 --> 01:34:16,480
Sister James.

1210
01:34:17,880 --> 01:34:19,520
What is it, Sister?

1211
01:34:25,560 --> 01:34:27,440
I have doubts.

1212
01:34:33,800 --> 01:34:37,920
I have such doubts.

1213
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:30,880
<i>Come, thou,
redeemer of the Earth</i>

1214
01:35:31,240 --> 01:35:37,720
<i>And manifest thy virgin birth</i>

1215
01:35:37,960 --> 01:35:44,400
<i>Let every age adoring fall</i>

1216
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:51,280
<i>Such birth befits the God of all</i>

1217
01:35:52,680 --> 01:35:59,160
<i>Begotten of no human will</i>

1218
01:35:59,560 --> 01:36:05,800
<i>But of the Spirit, thou art still</i>

1219
01:36:06,280 --> 01:36:12,960
<i>The word of God in flesh arrayed</i>

1220
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:20,000
<i>The promised fruit to man displayed</i>

1221
01:36:21,960 --> 01:36:28,400
<i>The virgin womb that burden gained</i>

1222
01:36:28,640 --> 01:36:34,920
<i>With virgin honor all unstained</i>

1223
01:36:35,560 --> 01:36:41,920
<i>The banners there of virtue glow</i>

1224
01:36:42,440 --> 01:36:48,960
<i>God in his temple dwells below</i>

1225
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:57,960
<i>Forth from his chamber goeth he</i>

1226
01:36:58,360 --> 01:37:04,920
<i>That royal home of purity</i>

1227
01:37:05,320 --> 01:37:12,000
<i>A giant in twofold substance one</i>

1228
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:19,120
<i>Rejoicing now his course to run</i>

1229
01:37:21,200 --> 01:37:27,880
<i>From God the Father he proceeds</i>

1230
01:37:28,200 --> 01:37:34,880
<i>To God the Father back he speeds</i>

1231
01:37:35,440 --> 01:37:42,120
<i>His course he runs to death and hell</i>

1232
01:37:42,480 --> 01:37:49,160
<i>Returning on God's throne to dwell</i>

1233
01:37:51,560 --> 01:37:58,160
<i>O equal to thy Father, thou</i>

1234
01:37:58,280 --> 01:38:04,800
<i>Gird on thy fleshly mantle now</i>

1235
01:38:05,240 --> 01:38:11,880
<i>The weakness of our mortal state</i>

1236

<i>With deathless might invigorate</i>

1237
