(anchor woman) After
months of speculation

10
00:01:29,321 --> 00:01:31,448
analysts expect an
announcement this week

11
00:01:31,523 --> 00:01:34,788
that GlobeCom International
will acquire Waterman Publishing

12
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,624
and its flagship
magazine, Sports America.

billionaire media magnate Teddy K.

15
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,293
has been on a spending spree recently,

16
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:46,236
acquiring a food service
company, a cable operator

17
00:01:46,305 --> 00:01:48,330
and two telecommunications providers

18
00:01:48,407 --> 00:01:51,501
in deals totaling more than $13 billion.

44
00:03:13,325 --> 00:03:16,192
My son-in-law tells me that
people don't read much anymore.

45
00:03:16,261 --> 00:03:18,661
Too much effort moving
the eyes back and forth.

46
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:20,255
So we're gonna put most of our budget

47
00:03:20,332 --> 00:03:22,391
into television, radio, Internet.

48
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:25,135
Okay.

00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:26,796
''Okay''? What does that mean?

50
00:03:26,872 --> 00:03:28,396
I'm not gonna try to sell you.

51
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:29,964
Why the hell not? You're a salesman.

52
00:03:30,042 --> 00:03:32,033
Yeah. Just not a very
good one, that's all.

53
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:33,135
I'll say.

54
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:34,770
But I am gonna ask you one favor.

00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:36,007
Oh, yeah?

56
00:03:36,081 --> 00:03:38,447
I'm gonna leave you an
issue of the magazine.

57
00:03:38,517 --> 00:03:41,213
And I'm personally gonna
send you a new one every week.

Now, I'll call you in a few weeks,

I've been with the magazine
for 20 years. I believe in it.

Well, good for you.

So, are you worried
about all these rumors

that your parent company
is about to be sold?

00:04:03,942 --> 00:04:04,931
No, not really.

71
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:06,534
I don't see how it would affect us.

72
00:04:06,612 --> 00:04:08,239
Well, hopefully it won't.

Simply put, we are never

less than .05 percent

and turn around marketing
in the magazine division.

172
00:08:32,544 --> 00:08:34,136
Uh, no.

173
00:08:34,246 --> 00:08:36,271
W-What about that Myron kid?

174
00:08:36,481 --> 00:08:37,948
I think that they're just friends.

175
00:08:38,016 --> 00:08:39,278
Yeah.

176
00:08:39,351 --> 00:08:40,511
[whispering] I'm pregnant.

[sighing]

179
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:47,722
I'm sorry. I thought you
said that you were pregnant.

180
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:48,885
Yeah.

181
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,518
You can't be pregnant.

182
00:08:50,595 --> 00:08:52,062
Yeah, I can. I'm... I am.

183
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:53,654
Now, how could that happen?

184
00:08:53,732 --> 00:08:55,757
Well, I think that you were there, too.

185
00:08:55,834 --> 00:08:57,495
No, honey.

186
00:08:57,969 --> 00:09:00,199
You know you're done with all that.

187
00:09:00,272 --> 00:09:02,706
That's what Dr. Steinberg
said, but he was wrong.

188
00:09:02,774 --> 00:09:04,674
You're pregnant? Yep.

189
00:09:04,976 --> 00:09:06,307
Holy crap.

00:09:07,913 --> 00:09:09,574
Holy crap!

00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:11,916
Are you sure?

192
00:09:11,983 --> 00:09:13,041
Yeah.

193
00:09:13,118 --> 00:09:15,018
Does it feel like a boy?

194
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:17,715
Right now it feels like a stomach flu.

195
00:09:18,256 --> 00:09:20,554
You can't be serious. Are you serious?

196
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:22,354
[whispering] I am serious.

Yeah.

201
00:09:35,907 --> 00:09:39,308
That means when he's 21,

202
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:41,676
I'll be 72.

203
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:42,714
Three.

204
00:09:42,781 --> 00:09:44,646
Two. Three.

205
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,915
Holy crap.

206
00:09:48,687 --> 00:09:52,646
I'm just so excited. I'm so excited.

207
00:09:53,191 --> 00:09:54,624
ls excitement contagious or what?

208
00:09:54,693 --> 00:09:55,955
Um, no.

209
00:09:56,027 --> 00:09:59,292
I'm being groomed. I'm being groomed.

210
00:09:59,364 --> 00:10:01,559
Do you have any idea what this means?

211
00:10:01,633 --> 00:10:03,260
That you're a chimpanzee?

212
00:10:03,335 --> 00:10:05,667
It means that we're on the road.

213
00:10:05,737 --> 00:10:08,228
You know, things are fallin' into place.

214
00:10:08,306 --> 00:10:09,671
We can buy a bigger house.

215
00:10:09,741 --> 00:10:10,867
We can have kids. You know?

How much more enthusiasm
are we looking at here?

220
00:10:20,685 --> 00:10:22,710
15 minutes? An hour?

221
00:10:23,388 --> 00:10:25,015
Honey, I'm sorry.

222
00:10:26,191 --> 00:10:28,751
It's just, Teddy K. knows my name.

223
00:10:30,462 --> 00:10:32,623
Are you even qualified for this job?

224
00:10:32,697 --> 00:10:35,131
What? Yes. Sure.

225
00:10:36,501 --> 00:10:39,334
Selling cell phones, selling ad space.

226
00:10:39,404 --> 00:10:41,429
You know, it's all the same crap.

227
00:10:42,374 --> 00:10:46,310
Anyway, it's just a stepping-stone.

228
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:50,437
Love you.

229

We're all gonna get fired.

Well, anything's possible.

234
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:05,820
No, it's not possible. It's probable.

235
00:11:05,897 --> 00:11:07,694
Did you hear about this Teddy K. guy?

236
00:11:07,766 --> 00:11:09,597
Hear about him?
Everybody's heard about him.

237
00:11:09,668 --> 00:11:11,727
I heard he's an albino, but
he covers it with makeup.

Alicia. Yes. What?

What? No! What? Why?

241
00:11:16,107 --> 00:11:17,165
You haven't heard anything.

242
00:11:17,242 --> 00:11:18,709
Why? Are you fired?

Uh, I'm sorry.

No, no, not yet. I mean not yet, Dan.

I'm... I can't predict the future. Um,

you're not head of ad sales anymore.

Who is Carter Duryea?

00:11:44,569 --> 00:11:46,764
Some hotshot from GlobeCom.

252
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:51,065
This a bummer, Dan. It's a real bummer.

253
00:11:51,142 --> 00:11:53,975
But you're lucky. A lot of people
are getting canned immediately

What are you gonna do,
start somewhere new?

You're not a kid anymore.

You know how tough it is out there.

People are cutting back.

266
00:12:17,802 --> 00:12:21,135
They're not looking for guys
like you who make a decent salary.

Hey, buddy, I am as pissed

I'm not smiling.

Yeah, your lips are curling up.

00:15:10,775 --> 00:15:11,799
What, to NYU?

334
00:15:11,876 --> 00:15:13,002
Yeah.

335
00:15:13,378 --> 00:15:14,936
Sweetheart, that's fantastic.

336
00:15:15,013 --> 00:15:15,945
Yeah.

337
00:15:16,047 --> 00:15:17,275
I'm so proud of you.

338
00:15:17,348 --> 00:15:18,713
Thank you.

339
00:15:19,384 --> 00:15:21,545
You'd--you'd have to live
here in the city, though.

340
00:15:21,619 --> 00:15:25,453
Yeah. And, uh, I want to
study creative writing.

341
00:15:25,523 --> 00:15:27,923
And NYU has such a great program.

342
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,056
But what about SUNY and the tennis team?

343
00:15:32,931 --> 00:15:35,957
Dad, I'm not gonna be a
professional tennis player.

344
00:15:36,034 --> 00:15:39,333
Well, look, sweetheart, being
a writer is just as tough.

345
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:43,971
You're living in the city and I don't--
I don't-- I don't like that idea.

346
00:15:44,042 --> 00:15:45,703
This is a lonely place.

347
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:48,039
You got to have street smarts.

348
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,580
I don't think that's such a good idea.

349
00:15:50,648 --> 00:15:51,637
Dad,

350
00:15:52,784 --> 00:15:55,252
I want to try living in the city.

351
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,309
And

352
00:15:57,255 --> 00:15:59,815
I know that NYU is more expensive,

353
00:16:00,325 --> 00:16:03,886
but it would be such a
great experience for me.

354
00:16:06,064 --> 00:16:07,861
Yeah. It is more expensive.

355
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,260
Yeah.

356
00:16:13,171 --> 00:16:14,229
But

357
00:16:15,206 --> 00:16:16,230
it's your education.

358
00:16:16,307 --> 00:16:17,205
Yeah.

359
00:16:17,275 --> 00:16:19,004
That's the most important thing, right?

360
00:16:19,077 --> 00:16:20,066
Yeah.

361
00:16:21,746 --> 00:16:23,475
We could manage it.

You're drenched.

Oh. Oh.

367
00:16:34,492 --> 00:16:36,187
I think you're gonna be very happy here.

368
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:38,229
You're really stepping
into an all-star team.

369

Oh, uh, this is Morty Wexler.

370
00:16:40,131 --> 00:16:41,155
Morty, Carter Duryea.

371
00:16:41,232 --> 00:16:43,029
Duryea. You're on the
Ford account, right?

372
00:16:43,101 --> 00:16:43,999
Correct.

373
00:16:44,102 --> 00:16:45,467
Well, it's a pleasure to meet you.

374
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:47,767
You, too. I'm really looking
forward to working with you.

375
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:48,897
Oh, terrific. Thanks.

376
00:16:48,973 --> 00:16:49,962
Okay.

377
00:16:50,475 --> 00:16:52,409

Uh, we have a terrific office for you.

00:16:57,849 --> 00:17:01,842
Great view. Um, It's not
cleared out yet. But, uh...

382
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:08,823
Not bad, huh?

383
00:17:11,129 --> 00:17:13,859
Uh, excuse me a second? I'm going
to use the little boys' room.

384
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:15,490
Oh, yeah. Sure.

Oh, I'm sorry. This is your office.

Yeah.

391
00:17:43,528 --> 00:17:45,393
You're the guy I bumped into.

392
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:48,430
Dan Foreman. Carter Duryea.

393
00:17:51,035 --> 00:17:52,627
You're Carter Duryea?

394
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:55,229
Yes, and, uh, it's a
pleasure to meet you.

395
00:17:56,641 --> 00:17:59,337
The Carter Duryea that's
come in to run ad sales?

396
00:17:59,477 --> 00:18:01,035
That's correct.

How old are you?

I'm 26 years old.

Twenty-six

400
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,193
and you're my new boss.

401
00:18:16,461 --> 00:18:18,622
[chuckling] Uh, I guess so.

402
00:18:19,664 --> 00:18:21,825
That's, uh, that's quite a...

403
00:18:22,533 --> 00:18:25,400
That's quite a kung-fu
grip you got there, Dan.

404
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:27,199
Oh, well. So,

405
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:32,207
what kind of experience
do you have in ad sales?

406
00:18:32,543 --> 00:18:34,306
Uh, well, I'll be honest with you, Dan.

407
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:35,641
Not much.

408
00:18:37,982 --> 00:18:39,074
How much?

409
00:18:39,183 --> 00:18:40,411
Um...

410
00:18:41,486 --> 00:18:42,612
None.

411
00:18:42,887 --> 00:18:45,117
None. That's not much.

412
00:18:45,189 --> 00:18:47,350
But I'm a fast learner, Dan.

413
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:53,253
Hey, now that you know how old I am,

414
00:18:53,564 --> 00:18:54,758

Wow. That's crazy. Yeah.

That's like a year older
than my dad, so that's weird.

00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:07,404
Oh, well, this is... This is great.

421
00:19:07,478 --> 00:19:08,775
You two have met.

422
00:19:08,846 --> 00:19:11,576
Are you kidding me? We
are old buddies by now.

423
00:19:11,649 --> 00:19:13,207
Dan, it was a pleasure to meet you.

424
00:19:13,284 --> 00:19:14,751
Pleasure.

425
00:19:14,986 --> 00:19:18,444
Um, Dan, you want
this door closed? Or...

426
00:19:19,357 --> 00:19:23,817
Yeah, you can go, um,
go ahead and close it.

427

So it was pretty unexpected.

430

But it's--it's like a
pretty big promotion.

431
00:20:01,866 --> 00:20:04,300
That's fantastic! Way to go.

432
00:20:05,203 --> 00:20:08,639
So, uh, the Boxster S has more guts.

You'll sure feel the extra horsepower.

434
00:20:11,142 --> 00:20:13,508
But if you really wanna go,

435
00:20:14,245 --> 00:20:17,305
I'd say take the 91 1 Carrera.

436
00:20:21,552 --> 00:20:23,679
I'm gonna go with the 91 1 .

00:24:13,084 --> 00:24:15,484
And that... that's
your baby's heartbeat.

499
00:24:17,355 --> 00:24:18,379
[gasping]

500
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:20,447
Oh, my God!

501
00:24:21,325 --> 00:24:23,225
Nice, strong heartbeat.

502
00:24:23,294 --> 00:24:25,319
That's your new baby, Dan.

503
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,461
[heart beating rapidly]

504
00:24:30,134 --> 00:24:31,192
Dan?

505
00:24:31,335 --> 00:24:32,825
[panting] Yeah?

506
00:24:33,604 --> 00:24:34,901
Are you okay?

507
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,336
Uh, yeah.

508
00:24:37,408 --> 00:24:39,035
That's fantastic.

509
00:24:41,512 --> 00:24:43,810
Uh, I'm feeling a little, uh...

510
00:24:45,816 --> 00:24:47,044
[chuckling]

511
00:24:47,118 --> 00:24:49,313
You are having a little
bit of arrhythmia.

512
00:24:49,387 --> 00:24:51,446
Have you been drinking
a lot of caffeine lately?

513
00:24:51,522 --> 00:24:52,614
No.

514
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:54,749
You under a lot of stress?

515
00:24:55,059 --> 00:24:56,583
Well, l...

516
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,925
I did sort of get demoted at work.

517
00:24:58,996 --> 00:25:00,122
Ah.

518
00:25:00,364 --> 00:25:01,388
You what?

519
00:25:01,465 --> 00:25:02,591
Yeah.

520
00:25:03,167 --> 00:25:06,398
l, uh... We'll talk.

521
00:25:10,908 --> 00:25:11,840
[dog barking]

522
00:25:11,909 --> 00:25:13,672
[crickets chirping]

523
00:25:16,113 --> 00:25:17,740
[car seat whirring]

524
00:25:33,564 --> 00:25:34,826
[cars honking]

525
00:25:36,834 --> 00:25:38,096
[gulping]

526
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:46,938
Another?

527
00:25:47,044 --> 00:25:50,571
Yeah, just keep them coming.
You don't even have to ask.

528
00:25:56,153 --> 00:25:57,415
[sighs]

529
00:25:58,322 --> 00:26:00,688
How was everyone's weekend? Fun?

530
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:03,359
I'm sorry. That was, uh...

531
00:26:03,928 --> 00:26:05,020
[sighing]

532
00:26:09,533 --> 00:26:10,795
[exhales]

533
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:12,362
[clearing throat]

534
00:26:12,436 --> 00:26:15,530
Um, I'd like to thank
everyone for joining me here.

535
00:26:15,639 --> 00:26:18,699
Teddy K. has an... has a thing

536
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:23,744
that what makes GlobeCom
great is the men and women

537
00:26:25,649 --> 00:26:26,638
of GlobeCom.

538
00:26:26,717 --> 00:26:28,981
ls it like a thousand
degrees in here or is it me?

539
00:26:29,053 --> 00:26:30,987
[chuckling] It's like...

540
00:26:31,655 --> 00:26:32,883
It's me.

541
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:36,185
I have an agenda.

542
00:26:36,327 --> 00:26:39,626
And you're gonna learn this
about me. I'm a machine.

543
00:26:43,033 --> 00:26:45,331
What was I saying about the...

544
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:46,928
(Alicia) An agenda.

545
00:26:47,004 --> 00:26:48,596
An agenda, I have an agenda.

546
00:26:48,672 --> 00:26:49,696
[sighing]

547
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:53,369
Which is that I have to immediately, um,

548
00:26:53,444 --> 00:26:57,505
increase the ad pages
here by 20 percent.

549
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:03,750
20 percent? Carter, only a
startup magazine can do that.

550
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:07,357
Yeah, well, I think
this team can do it, Dan.

551
00:27:07,491 --> 00:27:09,220
Um, how?

552
00:27:09,493 --> 00:27:11,188
Well, Morty,
basically what we--

553
00:27:11,262 --> 00:27:13,662
God, that's an awesome question.

554
00:27:14,432 --> 00:27:15,660
''How?''

555
00:27:17,401 --> 00:27:19,028
And the answer

556
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:23,939
is synergy.

557
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:29,780
We need to team up here.

558
00:27:31,048 --> 00:27:33,983
Yeah, we need to synchronize

559
00:27:34,752 --> 00:27:36,344
and we need to synergize.

560
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:38,945
We're not alone. We're not alone.

561
00:27:39,023 --> 00:27:41,457
We're part of one of
the biggest multimedia

562
00:27:41,525 --> 00:27:44,323
and brand name companies
in the known universe, okay?

563
00:27:44,395 --> 00:27:47,057
Let's--let's take advantage
of that, like, uh...

564
00:27:47,131 --> 00:27:48,120
Like...

565
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:51,526
Krispity Krunch.

566
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:53,403
Did anyone know that, uh,

567
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:55,598
one of our sister companies
is Krispity Krunch?

568
00:27:55,673 --> 00:27:56,697
So?

569
00:27:57,241 --> 00:28:00,369
So we talk to our brothers and
sisters over at Krispity Krunch.

570
00:28:00,444 --> 00:28:01,877
We make a deal where we supply

571
00:28:01,946 --> 00:28:03,846
sports factoids to their boxes.

572
00:28:03,914 --> 00:28:06,178
So that when Joe Couch
Potato is sitting there,

573
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:09,083
he's, uh, snacking, he looks
down, and what does he see?

574
00:28:09,153 --> 00:28:11,621
Sports America, Krispity
Krunch sports factoids.

575
00:28:11,689 --> 00:28:13,714
He's definitely buying
more Krispity Krunch

576
00:28:13,791 --> 00:28:15,190
and not Krunch 'n Krackle

577
00:28:15,259 --> 00:28:18,751
which, by the way, looks
and tastes exactly the same.

578
00:28:18,829 --> 00:28:21,923
But guess what? No sports factoids.

579
00:28:21,999 --> 00:28:25,093
And Krispity Krunch is so happy
they guarantee us 28 pages a year.

580
00:28:25,169 --> 00:28:27,137
Besides which, they know if they don't,

581
00:28:27,204 --> 00:28:28,728
Teddy K. is gonna be pissed.

582
00:28:28,806 --> 00:28:32,071
What is that? What am l
talking about here, people?

583
00:28:35,145 --> 00:28:36,407
Synergy.

584
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:39,816
lsn't that cheating?

585
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:41,681
No, no. Hell, no.

586
00:28:41,752 --> 00:28:43,117
And, uh, Techline cell phones.

587
00:28:43,187 --> 00:28:44,381
We own Techline cell phones.

588
00:28:44,455 --> 00:28:45,888
Guess what we put on their browser?

589
00:28:45,956 --> 00:28:47,116
Factoids.

590
00:28:47,191 --> 00:28:49,455
Yes! Factoids! Synergy!

591
00:28:49,527 --> 00:28:51,427
And what else? Uh, box scores. And ads!

592
00:28:51,495 --> 00:28:53,554
We make a deal like a
100,000 hits on the Internet

593
00:28:53,631 --> 00:28:56,156
has the equivalent value of
one ad page of our hard copy.

594
00:28:56,233 --> 00:28:57,359
Are you getting it, people?

595
00:28:57,434 --> 00:28:59,265
The magazine has become just a portal

596
00:28:59,336 --> 00:29:01,395
to a synergized world
of cross-promotion.

597
00:29:01,472 --> 00:29:03,167
We're gonna bust things wide open.

598
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,208
We are gonna take
things to the next level.

599
00:29:05,276 --> 00:29:08,143
Who's with me? Who's with
me? Who-- who's psyched?

600
00:29:08,212 --> 00:29:09,338
Lou, are you psyched?

601
00:29:09,413 --> 00:29:10,471
Yeah. Yeah, I'm psyched.

602
00:29:10,548 --> 00:29:11,708
Okay.

603
00:29:11,782 --> 00:29:12,976
Alicia, are you psyched?

604
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:14,074
Absolutely.

605
00:29:14,151 --> 00:29:17,678
Better. This guy. I'm sorry,
I don't know your name yet.

606
00:29:17,988 --> 00:29:20,047
Hector. I'm in maintenance.

607
00:29:20,124 --> 00:29:22,058
That's cool. Hector...

608
00:29:22,593 --> 00:29:24,026
Hector, I know you're psyched.

609
00:29:24,094 --> 00:29:25,254
I'm psyched!

610
00:29:25,329 --> 00:29:26,387
[all laughing]

611
00:29:26,463 --> 00:29:27,828
Yes, Hector's psyched!

612
00:29:27,898 --> 00:29:30,389
And if Hector's psyched,
then you know I'm psyched.

613
00:29:30,467 --> 00:29:32,492
I am psyched for this team.

614
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:34,231
Now who else is with me? Who's psyched?

615
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:35,602
(all) I'm psyched!

616
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:37,573
(Carter) Excellent. Who else? Come on.

617
00:29:37,641 --> 00:29:40,166
Who do you think will be
the first to get canned?

618
00:29:40,244 --> 00:29:42,769
My money's on Dan. He's prehistoric.

619
00:29:53,724 --> 00:29:55,123
Sorry, Dan.

620
00:29:55,192 --> 00:29:56,591
Thanks for joining me for lunch.

621
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:57,888
You like sushi?

622
00:29:57,962 --> 00:30:00,055
I'll just stick with the teriyaki.

623
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:01,495
You should try some.

624
00:30:01,565 --> 00:30:03,829
The spicy tuna here is money.

625
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:06,027
Come here. Get that.

626
00:30:07,705 --> 00:30:08,694
Get that.

627
00:30:09,173 --> 00:30:11,073
Yeah, go fishing, man.

628
00:30:12,743 --> 00:30:13,732
Yeah.

629
00:30:19,049 --> 00:30:20,482
[grunting]

630
00:30:20,551 --> 00:30:23,213
Yeah. So I wanted to talk to you,

631
00:30:23,287 --> 00:30:24,276
[grunting]

632
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:25,322
because, uh,

633
00:30:25,389 --> 00:30:26,321
This is raw.

634
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:28,119
...an increase in ad pages is...

635
00:30:28,192 --> 00:30:30,023
Well, it's really only
part of the equation

636
00:30:30,094 --> 00:30:31,618
in terms of achieving the bottom line

637
00:30:31,695 --> 00:30:33,026
my bosses want me to hit.

638
00:30:33,097 --> 00:30:35,793
Understand, Teddy K. is making
cuts across the board here.

639
00:30:35,866 --> 00:30:39,529
In point of fact, I have to cut

640
00:30:40,137 --> 00:30:43,231
$300,000 salary from the
sales team immediately.

641
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,705
[grunting]

642
00:30:45,643 --> 00:30:48,168
I don't make that much money, Carter.

643
00:30:48,545 --> 00:30:50,775
I know how much you make, Dan.

644
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:53,976
Well,

645
00:30:54,918 --> 00:30:57,148
I wish you'd told me that I was fired

646
00:30:57,221 --> 00:30:59,451
before I ate the goddamn fish.

647
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:01,214
Oh, Dan! Dan! Dan!

648
00:31:01,525 --> 00:31:02,890
[clearing throat]

649
00:31:04,595 --> 00:31:06,995
I'm--I'm not
letting you go here.

650
00:31:07,665 --> 00:31:08,723
You're not?

651
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:09,857
No.

652
00:31:12,302 --> 00:31:14,463
You are an excellent salesman.

653
00:31:14,538 --> 00:31:16,335
You ran a good team.

654
00:31:16,407 --> 00:31:19,001
I think that you have the potential

655
00:31:19,343 --> 00:31:21,811
to be an awesome wingman here.

656
00:31:24,214 --> 00:31:25,943
An awesome wingman?

657
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:28,510
[laughing]

658
00:31:29,386 --> 00:31:33,015
B-But, Carter, I definitely
see the benefit for you

659
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:34,990
in having an awesome wingman.

660
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:37,994
But what is the benefit for
me at this point in my career

661
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:40,223
of being an awesome wingman?

662
00:31:42,733 --> 00:31:43,722
Well,

663
00:31:45,002 --> 00:31:47,835
one benefit at this point in your career

664
00:31:48,872 --> 00:31:51,272
is that you get to keep your job.

665
00:31:52,276 --> 00:31:55,268
That's a pretty good
benefit, don't you think?

666
00:31:58,315 --> 00:32:02,342
Really? Really! Are you smiling?

667
00:32:03,287 --> 00:32:05,755
You're smiling! This is funny to you.

668
00:32:05,823 --> 00:32:08,451
Guess what? You have no idea

669
00:32:08,525 --> 00:32:11,187
what a nightmare you're
about to step into, my friend.

670
00:32:11,261 --> 00:32:12,523
[door opening]

00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:14,124
A-hole!

672
00:32:14,198 --> 00:32:17,361
We'll see how soon this place goes
down the poop chute without me.

673
00:32:18,669 --> 00:32:21,229
Maybe there is justice in the world.

674
00:32:21,405 --> 00:32:23,771
You enjoying yourselves? Great.

[Gone For Good by The Shins playing]

Untie me, I've said no vows

678
00:32:45,462 --> 00:32:48,863
The train is getting way too loud

679
00:32:48,932 --> 00:32:50,024
Carter is ready for you.

680
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,965
I gotta leave here my girl

681
00:32:52,035 --> 00:32:54,902
Get on with my lonely life

682
00:32:55,472 --> 00:32:58,441
Dan, uh, I'd like you to take a
look at one of these forms for me.

683
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:00,409
It's a 360 evaluation. Mmm-hmm.

684
00:33:00,477 --> 00:33:02,809
It's basically an
evaluation from every angle.

685
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,279
That's why it's called a 360.

686
00:33:04,348 --> 00:33:05,679
It's corporate policy.

687
00:33:05,749 --> 00:33:07,649
But it would be great
if I had it by Monday.

I mean, you know it's me.

698
00:33:32,709 --> 00:33:36,145
Uh, just filling up the old

699
00:33:37,047 --> 00:33:38,344
or don't.

Oh, hi, Mrs. Cherneski.

00:33:50,027 --> 00:33:52,052
No, I didn't know he moved out.

707
00:33:52,129 --> 00:33:54,757
Well, tell him Carter says hi.

I know. It'll be great. We'll
get a great jump on the week.

Not the whole day, just a
couple of hours in the afternoon.

723
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:24,823
I'll tell you what, I
will see you there at noon.

724
00:34:24,895 --> 00:34:26,988
Uh, I'll bring some sushi.
It'll be a lot of fun.

Yeah, when I was three.

doing here on a Sunday?

You should really meet him.

Yeah, I'd rather not
get personally involved.

Didn't we decide to let him go?

Uh, no, we let Enrique
Colon go instead. Remember?

Yeah. That's right.

00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:50,277
Right. Um, but I think we're
gonna get ad pages up here.

00:35:50,347 --> 00:35:52,440
So I don't think we
need to riff anybody yet.

00:35:52,516 --> 00:35:55,417
Well, sooner or later everybody
has to deal with reality.

uh, grab a drink or something?

You know, I'd love to, but
I'm a recovering alcoholic.

How about you, Morty. Drink?

Uh, I'd better get home for dinner.

to go home and do my hair.

No one.

787
00:36:45,936 --> 00:36:47,301
No kidding.

788
00:36:54,244 --> 00:36:55,233
I'm home.

789
00:36:55,312 --> 00:36:56,404
Yes.

790
00:36:57,114 --> 00:36:59,139
Oh, this is what I'm talking about.

791
00:36:59,216 --> 00:37:02,982
This is like a real home-type home.

Carter Duryea from the office.

you. Hey, Mrs. Foreman.

00:37:08,258 --> 00:37:09,384
What a pleasure to meet you.

795
00:37:09,459 --> 00:37:12,087
Thank you so much for
having me into your home.

796
00:37:12,162 --> 00:37:13,857
[clearing throat] You're very welcome.

797
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:15,693
I hope you like baked ziti.

798
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:19,634
Baked ziti! Uh, this
is... This is so perfect.

799
00:37:19,703 --> 00:37:21,694
That baked ziti. That's
so... This is what I need.

800
00:37:21,772 --> 00:37:25,606
Like a-- Like a real,
home-cooked thing.

801
00:37:25,675 --> 00:37:27,199
This is great.

802
00:37:27,711 --> 00:37:29,770
ls there something wrong with him?

803
00:37:29,846 --> 00:37:31,143
Clearly.

804
00:37:31,214 --> 00:37:34,547
Let's just feed him and get
him the hell outta here, okay?

805
00:37:34,618 --> 00:37:36,313
He's really young.

806
00:37:36,386 --> 00:37:38,354
He's a lot younger than you.

807
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:40,982
Yeah. Thank you for that. Thank you.

808
00:37:41,091 --> 00:37:42,217
[chuckling]

809
00:37:43,193 --> 00:37:45,661
So, um, I did the numbers on NYU.

810
00:37:46,897 --> 00:37:48,694
Do you know how expensive that place is?

811
00:37:48,765 --> 00:37:50,198
Hmm. Plus living expenses.

812
00:37:50,267 --> 00:37:53,100
Plus Jana's orthodonture.
Plus baby costs.

813
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:54,194
Don't worry about it.

814
00:37:54,271 --> 00:37:57,434
Well, that's not actually a solution
to a problem. ''Don't worry about it.''

815
00:37:57,507 --> 00:37:59,600
I think we may have to
take out a second mortgage.

816
00:37:59,676 --> 00:38:03,373
Why don't I just go into the living
room and ask my boss for a raise?

817
00:38:14,224 --> 00:38:15,213
Oh, hey.

818
00:38:15,292 --> 00:38:17,487
I was, uh, just looking at you and...

819
00:38:17,561 --> 00:38:18,755
And you've...

820
00:38:18,829 --> 00:38:19,818
We never got to...

821
00:38:19,896 --> 00:38:21,090
That day in the elevator.

822
00:38:21,164 --> 00:38:22,529
My name's Carter Duryea.

823
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:24,328
Yeah, I know who you are.

824
00:38:27,771 --> 00:38:29,170
Does my dad know you're here?

825
00:38:29,239 --> 00:38:31,207
Uh, your dad invited me over for dinner.

826
00:38:32,375 --> 00:38:33,774
Technically.

827
00:38:35,779 --> 00:38:37,144
Uh, who's that?

828
00:38:37,214 --> 00:38:38,841
Uh, it's Dad's new boss.

829
00:38:38,915 --> 00:38:41,509
You can't be Dad's new
boss. You're too young.

830
00:38:42,319 --> 00:38:44,184
Yeah, and he's also scared shitless.

831
00:38:44,855 --> 00:38:46,482
Wow, good memory.

832
00:38:46,556 --> 00:38:48,581
And you're too cute to be Dad's boss.

833
00:38:48,658 --> 00:38:51,286
Oh, well, thank you.

834
00:38:51,361 --> 00:38:52,385
[phone ringing]

835
00:38:52,462 --> 00:38:53,759
I got it!

[sighing]

837
00:39:01,905 --> 00:39:03,839
So, uh, how's it going?

838
00:39:04,541 --> 00:39:05,667
Okay.

839
00:39:08,345 --> 00:39:10,870
So what are you doing here, really?

840
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:17,447
Uh, my wife left me, and today's
the anniversary of our first date.

841
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:22,322
I found the idea of going
home to be so depressing

842
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:25,256
that I kind of leeched onto your dad

843
00:39:25,328 --> 00:39:27,762
and invited myself over for dinner.

844

[snickering]

845
00:39:29,766 --> 00:39:33,532
Wow, you're sort of a
bizarrely honest guy. Huh?

846
00:39:34,905 --> 00:39:35,963
No.

847
00:39:37,174 --> 00:39:38,266
No. Honestly, I'm...

848

[chuckling]

00:39:39,309 --> 00:39:40,207
I'm not.

850
00:39:40,277 --> 00:39:42,006
Just around you, for some reason.

851
00:39:42,078 --> 00:39:44,842
People would probably say
that I'm an emotionally guarded

852
00:39:44,915 --> 00:39:46,815
anal-retentive asshole.

853
00:39:51,955 --> 00:39:53,582
You wanna play foosball? Okay.

854
00:39:53,657 --> 00:39:55,318
Cool, I'll just change.

855
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:56,757
Okay. Good. Yeah.

856
00:39:56,993 --> 00:40:00,258
Do you think Alex could cope with
living in the city on her own?

[sighing]

858
00:40:01,398 --> 00:40:04,492
Well, I'm less worried about her
coping with it than I am about you.

859
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:07,230
Yeah, well, frankly, I'd rather
keep her under house arrest

860
00:40:07,304 --> 00:40:09,238
with a homing device around her ankle.

861
00:40:09,306 --> 00:40:11,866
Then why did you agree to it
without even talking to me?

00:40:11,942 --> 00:40:13,273
[grunting]

863
00:40:13,877 --> 00:40:16,243
And why is your teenage boss here?

864
00:40:16,313 --> 00:40:18,304
And why am I so nauseous?

865
00:40:18,481 --> 00:40:20,574
I hardly had any morning
sickness the first two times.

866

Hey, hey, hey!

867
00:40:21,751 --> 00:40:22,775
and I'm so sick of it!

868
00:40:22,852 --> 00:40:24,114
Calm down. Let me have that.

I'm not really that into tennis anymore.

873
00:40:42,939 --> 00:40:45,032
What I'm really not
into is being the jock.

874
00:40:45,108 --> 00:40:47,804
You know, it's like people don't
even invite me to their parties

875
00:40:47,877 --> 00:40:49,970
because they think I'm
in training or something.

876
00:40:50,046 --> 00:40:52,276
Also, there's this rumor going
around that I'm a lesbian.

877
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:54,476
[Carter chuckling] Man, that sucks.

878
00:40:55,118 --> 00:40:57,814
Or not. I don't... Not being a lesbian.

879
00:40:59,089 --> 00:41:00,249
Yeah, well, I'm not.

880
00:41:05,929 --> 00:41:08,955
It'd be one thing if I wanted to
go pro and make a ton of money,

881
00:41:09,032 --> 00:41:10,590
but I'm not at that level.

882
00:41:10,667 --> 00:41:12,965
I've played girls at
that level and I'm not.

883
00:41:13,036 --> 00:41:14,663
I mean, not that I'd want that, really.

Their lives have peaked by
the time they're like 21 .

Oh, nice.

886
00:41:21,177 --> 00:41:23,304
I wonder that about
myself sometimes, too.

887
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:25,541
Like maybe my life has peaked at 26.

888
00:41:25,615 --> 00:41:27,708
Maybe it's all downhill from here.

889
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:31,478
Well, it probably is.

890
00:41:31,554 --> 00:41:33,044

00:41:49,439 --> 00:41:50,997
My boyfriend.

Your what?

897
00:41:58,181 --> 00:42:01,742
Hi, this is Mr. Foreman. Who
is this and how old are you?

898
00:42:02,352 --> 00:42:04,081
All right. Well, I just wanted to say

899
00:42:04,154 --> 00:42:07,146
if you ever give my daughter an
alcoholic beverage or a joint,

900
00:42:07,223 --> 00:42:08,781
I will hunt you down and neuter you.

Oh, my God, this pizza's
amazing. Where'd you get this?

00:42:45,695 --> 00:42:48,892
It's from a wonderful little
Italian restaurant called Domino's.

917
00:42:48,965 --> 00:42:51,399
So, are you really Dad's new boss?

We're not, uh, we're
really more colleagues.

No, that's not true. He's
the boss man. I'm the wingman.

You're wearing a wedding ring.

Um, yes, I am, sort of.

Um, or... Yes, no. I'm married.

985
00:46:41,364 --> 00:46:44,800
That's why we're gonna be takin'
'em to the GlobeCom luxury suite.

986
00:46:44,867 --> 00:46:47,700
Well, these aren't
luxury suite type of guys.

987
00:46:47,770 --> 00:46:49,738
Dan, everyone's a
luxury suite type of guy.

988
00:46:49,806 --> 00:46:50,830
[chuckling]

989
00:46:50,907 --> 00:46:53,273
Uh, we can't go there on
Wednesday, because Teddy K.

990
00:46:53,343 --> 00:46:56,506
is hosting Bill Clinton,
Jay-Z, and Kofi Annan.

991
00:46:56,579 --> 00:46:57,876
We're gonna do it Thursday.

992
00:46:57,947 --> 00:46:59,437
I'll bring them to a concert.

993
00:46:59,515 --> 00:47:03,144
Look, I gotta get these guys
to up their buy by 18 pages.

994
00:47:03,219 --> 00:47:05,244
We gotta start kicking some ass here.

[sighing]

996
00:47:06,522 --> 00:47:08,490
I'm gonna have to let some people go.

997
00:47:08,558 --> 00:47:10,788
Why do you say ''let them go''?

998
00:47:11,394 --> 00:47:13,294
They don't want to go.

999
00:47:13,496 --> 00:47:15,964
Why don't you just say, ''fire them''?

1000
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,797
Because it sounds better.

1001
00:47:18,935 --> 00:47:21,836
Not to the person
getting fired, it doesn't.

1002
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,572
You wanna get with me? Put 'em up

1004
00:47:29,712 --> 00:47:34,376
This guy was shot 1 2 times
and pronounced legally dead.

1005
00:47:34,784 --> 00:47:36,308
Hence the name.

1006
00:47:36,386 --> 00:47:39,253
Someone should tell him
it's spelled D-E-A-D.

They're afraid to.

1009
00:47:41,724 --> 00:47:44,454
He's got the number one
hit single right now.

1010
00:47:44,661 --> 00:47:46,356
He's a protege of 50 Cent.

1011
00:47:46,429 --> 00:47:48,090
Why don't they just call him ''NickeI''?

1012
00:47:48,164 --> 00:47:50,132
[laughing] What?

1013
00:47:50,199 --> 00:47:53,134

still haven't improved.

to meet my colleague.

Hey, hey.

1017
00:47:58,241 --> 00:47:59,230
Hmm.

1018
00:47:59,409 --> 00:48:01,138
Cross-promotional idea.

1019
00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:03,474
You buy a certain amount
of Jamaican rum, boom.

1020
00:48:03,546 --> 00:48:06,208
You get a discount on
running shoes. Done.

1021
00:48:06,282 --> 00:48:07,749
Yeah, sounds like a great fit.

got chimichangas on the way.

00:48:27,470 --> 00:48:28,801
Sorry about the concert.

1030
00:48:28,871 --> 00:48:31,499
They wouldn't let me just get
regular seats for the Knicks game.

1031
00:48:31,574 --> 00:48:33,098
No, it's okay.

1032
00:48:33,376 --> 00:48:36,868
Look, Dan. I've been
instructed not to advertise

1033
00:48:36,946 --> 00:48:38,937
with Sports America anymore.

1034
00:48:39,015 --> 00:48:40,107
What?

1035
00:48:40,383 --> 00:48:44,376
We were bought out last year by this
company called Continental Brands.

1036
00:48:44,454 --> 00:48:46,615
Apparently, the company that bought us

1037
00:48:46,689 --> 00:48:48,486
and the company that bought you

1038
00:48:48,558 --> 00:48:52,153
are having a feud over wireless
communications in Europe.

1039
00:48:53,062 --> 00:48:54,495
Wireless communications?

1040
00:48:54,564 --> 00:48:57,124
What--what the hell does that
have to do with our business?

1041
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:01,068
Nothing. But we have
this corporate policy now.

1042
00:49:01,604 --> 00:49:03,401
Look, I'm sorry, Dan.

Dan, I have to

1046
00:49:19,322 --> 00:49:21,688
fire Louie and Morty.

1047
00:49:21,891 --> 00:49:22,983
No, you don't.

1048
00:49:23,059 --> 00:49:24,048
I do.

1049
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:25,890
We're gonna get those ad pages back.

1050
00:49:25,962 --> 00:49:27,657
We'll get those...

1051
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:30,699
Oh, my God! It's like you
don't get it or something.

1052
00:49:30,767 --> 00:49:32,530
That was a huge client.

1053
00:49:32,602 --> 00:49:34,229
Steckle gave me a bottom line here.

1054

I have to increase pages.

1055
00:49:36,105 --> 00:49:39,438
We already got Harry, Pete,
and Alicia on the Ford account.

1056
00:49:39,509 --> 00:49:41,136
Morty's the logical choice.

1057
00:49:41,210 --> 00:49:43,906
Oh, and the new woman at Pepsi
thinks that Louie's a sexist.

1058
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:45,572
Guess why. He called her ''sugar tits.''

1059
00:49:45,648 --> 00:49:46,945
He's an idiot.

1060
00:49:47,016 --> 00:49:49,280
Come on, you can't fire these guys.

1061
00:49:49,352 --> 00:49:50,944
These are my guys.

1062
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:52,954
They've been with me for eight years.

1063
00:49:53,022 --> 00:49:54,717
I hired them at the same time.

1064
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:55,951
Yeah, I know, Dan.

1065
00:49:56,025 --> 00:49:57,856
That's why they have
huge, bloated salaries.

1066
00:49:57,927 --> 00:50:00,452
And they're not pulling their weight.

1067
00:50:00,897 --> 00:50:02,228
I'm sorry.

1068
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:07,034
Well, I've been here for 23 years.

1069
00:50:08,104 --> 00:50:10,629
My salary's bigger than theirs.
Why don't you just fire me?

1070
00:50:10,706 --> 00:50:12,901
Do you want me to fire you?

1071
00:50:13,242 --> 00:50:15,142
Because I could, Dan.

1072
00:50:15,344 --> 00:50:17,039
You have a family that loves you.

1073
00:50:17,113 --> 00:50:18,375
You have a kid on the way.

1074
00:50:18,447 --> 00:50:21,211
I look at you sometimes and it's like...

1075
00:50:25,621 --> 00:50:28,055
You have people who need you.

1076

really got to know him.

[sighs] I'm sorry.

1304
01:04:06,441 --> 01:04:09,877
Yes, I'm ten years ahead

1305
01:04:12,648 --> 01:04:15,082
But I've worked here for 5 years.

(Carter) Okay, you ready?

1310
01:05:04,232 --> 01:05:05,563
Will you be okay with that thing?

1311
01:05:05,634 --> 01:05:07,261
Oh, yeah, fine.

1312
01:05:08,270 --> 01:05:10,261
Hey, uh, what's that big guy doing here?

1313
01:05:10,338 --> 01:05:12,272
He's one of the moving men.

1314
01:05:14,242 --> 01:05:17,336
Uh, I guess, uh, Steckle
recruited him for his VP team.

1315
01:05:17,412 --> 01:05:19,073
Oh, that's fair.

1316
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:22,175
Wonder if I can still dunk.

1317
01:05:23,418 --> 01:05:24,510
You could dunk?

1318
01:05:24,586 --> 01:05:26,713

01:05:32,427 --> 01:05:34,759
Word on the street is,
Teddy K.'s on the prowl.

1324
01:05:34,830 --> 01:05:37,196
Soon as he gets back from his
around-the-world balloon trip,

1325
01:05:37,265 --> 01:05:39,096
he's gonna go munch
on Continental Brands.

1326
01:05:39,167 --> 01:05:40,361
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey, great.

1327
01:05:40,435 --> 01:05:42,733
Maybe they'll advertise
in the magazine again.

1328
01:05:42,804 --> 01:05:44,772
I'm sorry, who are you?

1329
01:05:45,140 --> 01:05:46,164
Mark, this is Dan Foreman.

1330
01:05:46,241 --> 01:05:48,175
He's the one I was telling you about,

1331
01:05:48,243 --> 01:05:49,870
helped us close that Toys 'R' Us deal.

1332
01:05:49,945 --> 01:05:51,378
Oh, Carter's being modest.

1333
01:05:51,446 --> 01:05:53,141
He did most of the work. Aw.

1334
01:05:53,215 --> 01:05:54,239
That's beautiful.

1335
01:05:54,316 --> 01:05:56,580
Maybe you two should get a room.

When you were 18,

did you ever return your

she won't call me back.

And I feel like going down
to NYU and kidnapping her

1404

from the very brief time that I met her,

to be pretty savvy.

I don't think you have to
worry about her too much.

And, um...

1466
01:12:21,236 --> 01:12:24,137
This is really not a
big deal. But l, uh...

1467
01:12:25,707 --> 01:12:27,732
I got something for you.

1468
01:12:30,778 --> 01:12:32,678
It's not my birthday.

1469
01:12:33,348 --> 01:12:34,610
Go on.

1470
01:12:41,890 --> 01:12:43,016
Holy shit.

1471
01:12:43,091 --> 01:12:44,558
[laughs]

1472
01:12:49,264 --> 01:12:51,960
Wow! Are these real diamonds?

1473
01:12:53,768 --> 01:12:55,531
It's too expensive.

1474
01:12:55,603 --> 01:12:57,628
No. No, don't. No.

1475
01:12:57,705 --> 01:12:58,967
I feel funny.

1476
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:01,907
I'm sorry. I don't... I
mean, it's not... l--l...

1477
01:13:01,976 --> 01:13:03,876
It just felt good to...

1478
01:13:03,945 --> 01:13:05,310
It's sweet.

1479
01:13:07,015 --> 01:13:10,041
It's very sweet. Thank you.

1480
01:13:16,891 --> 01:13:18,950
You're the kind of person

1481
01:13:19,694 --> 01:13:22,492
that's it's good to
be in a foxhole with.

1482
01:13:25,833 --> 01:13:28,666
We're not in a foxhole.
We're in a Porsche.

1483
01:13:28,903 --> 01:13:30,029
(Dan) A sling.

1484

(woman) Yes.

1485
01:13:31,539 --> 01:13:33,404

Let's see, what.... Wow.

1488
01:13:39,847 --> 01:13:41,781
And this could be what?

you already have some.

Thanks.

1505
01:14:47,548 --> 01:14:48,674
She waits.

1506
01:14:48,750 --> 01:14:49,876
Okay.

1507
01:14:56,057 --> 01:14:57,115
(Carter) Hey.

1508
01:14:57,191 --> 01:14:58,385
Hi.

1509
01:14:58,459 --> 01:14:59,619
Sorry I'm late.

1510
01:14:59,694 --> 01:15:02,162
Work has been just nuts.

1511
01:15:02,230 --> 01:15:04,721
That's okay. I have a class at 3:00.

1512
01:15:07,735 --> 01:15:09,327
[car honking]

1513
01:15:23,084 --> 01:15:25,609
Oh, you're... You're
wearing the necklace.

1514
01:15:25,687 --> 01:15:28,053
Yeah. Yeah. I feel like an impostor.

1515
01:15:28,122 --> 01:15:29,680
But it's nice. An impostor?

1516
01:15:29,757 --> 01:15:30,815
No, you look...

1517
01:15:30,892 --> 01:15:33,224
Hey. Doesn't she look beautiful?

1518
01:15:33,461 --> 01:15:34,860
She does.

1519
01:15:34,929 --> 01:15:36,692
(waiter) Now, we have
three specials today.

1520
01:15:36,764 --> 01:15:38,527
Avocado soup with awapuhi oil,

1521
01:15:38,599 --> 01:15:41,796
bluefin tuna with Awapuhi
and jalapeno sashimi.

1522
01:15:42,537 --> 01:15:44,198
(waiter) We have calamari fritti

1523
01:15:44,272 --> 01:15:46,433
with Awapuhi oil on the side.

1524
01:15:46,507 --> 01:15:49,305
We also have, uh,
sicafreed lobster tail.

1525
01:15:49,444 --> 01:15:52,242
Can I get that with
a side of Awapuhi oil?

1526
01:15:55,416 --> 01:15:57,384
Welcome. May I help you?

1527
01:16:01,322 --> 01:16:02,619
Oh, shit.

1528
01:16:04,959 --> 01:16:06,483
Hi, is there going to be a third?

1529
01:16:06,561 --> 01:16:08,461
I have just one question.

1530
01:16:08,529 --> 01:16:10,622
Are you sleeping with him?

1531
01:16:13,768 --> 01:16:16,396
I'm going to get you folks some bread.

1532
01:16:17,505 --> 01:16:19,496
Uh, Dan, this isn't what it looks like.

1533
01:16:19,574 --> 01:16:22,042
Oh, yeah? What does it look like?

1534
01:16:22,443 --> 01:16:25,139
Tell me. What do you
think it looks like?

1535
01:16:25,213 --> 01:16:29,582
Well, I'm sure it looks like
some kind of sleazy, tawdry...

1536
01:16:34,489 --> 01:16:37,117
Alex, I asked you a question.
Are you sleeping with him?

1537
01:16:39,093 --> 01:16:41,425
What do you want me to say, Dad?

1538
01:16:46,434 --> 01:16:47,765
[sighs]

1539
01:16:48,202 --> 01:16:49,430
Get up.

1540
01:16:50,104 --> 01:16:51,162
What?

1541
01:16:51,239 --> 01:16:52,536
Get up.

1542
01:16:58,112 --> 01:16:59,170
Dad!

1543
01:16:59,247 --> 01:17:01,306
Pardon me, sir, but I don't
think you should treat--

1544
01:17:01,382 --> 01:17:04,909
Back off, before I drop-kick
you across this restaurant.

1545
01:17:06,587 --> 01:17:08,282
You are a piece of shit!

1546
01:17:08,356 --> 01:17:09,584
Dan, I love her.

1547
01:17:09,657 --> 01:17:10,988
You what?

1548
01:17:11,926 --> 01:17:13,325
I love her.

1549
01:17:13,594 --> 01:17:15,186
[Carter panting]

1550
01:17:16,898 --> 01:17:18,297
I love you.

1551
01:17:20,435 --> 01:17:22,403
You love her? She's my daughter.

1552
01:17:23,304 --> 01:17:25,932
She's in college.
She's a college student.

1553
01:17:26,007 --> 01:17:28,840
I took out a fricking second
mortgage so she could go.

1554
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:31,174
Three years ago she was in braces.

1555
01:17:32,747 --> 01:17:34,180
I'm sorry.

1556
01:17:38,453 --> 01:17:39,750
This guy.

1557
01:17:40,721 --> 01:17:42,188
You had to sleep with him?

1558
01:17:42,256 --> 01:17:43,553
Dad, l...

1559
01:17:44,192 --> 01:17:45,454
Dad...

1560
01:17:48,262 --> 01:17:49,422
(Alex) Dad.

[groans]

1562
01:17:51,632 --> 01:17:52,963
Dad! Wait, I'm sorry.

1563
01:17:53,034 --> 01:17:54,797
This had nothing to do with you.

1564
01:17:54,869 --> 01:17:56,302
He's my boss, Alex.

1565
01:17:56,370 --> 01:17:59,066
I know. But it just happened.

1566
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:01,665
We made a deal, remember?

1567
01:18:02,043 --> 01:18:04,944
We made a deal we'd always
be honest with one another.

1568
01:18:05,012 --> 01:18:07,776
Dad, I was like 5 years
old when we made that deal.

1569
01:18:07,849 --> 01:18:10,079
Yeah. I liked you better then.

1570
01:18:10,918 --> 01:18:12,442
That's awful.

1571
01:18:13,721 --> 01:18:15,985
That's an awful thing to say.

1572
01:18:16,591 --> 01:18:19,082
Dad, please don't walk
away. I want to talk to you.

1573
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:21,287
Why? You don't need my
advice about anything.

1574

[door opening]

1575
01:18:45,086 --> 01:18:46,212
Hey, you.

1576

Hey.

1577
01:18:47,455 --> 01:18:49,980
Hey, Carter. Wow, that's some shiner.

1578
01:18:50,658 --> 01:18:51,647
Thanks.

1579
01:18:52,026 --> 01:18:54,620
Maya, could we have
some privacy, please?

1580
01:18:54,695 --> 01:18:56,822
Sure. Absolutely.

01:19:12,380 --> 01:19:14,211
Oh, yeah. Thank you.

[clears throat]

1586
01:19:18,519 --> 01:19:20,350
Um, there's no ice.

1587
01:19:21,088 --> 01:19:22,919
But the soda's cold.

Oh, thanks.

1589
01:19:27,528 --> 01:19:31,020
Look, I wanted to apologize,
uh, for my timing when...

1590
01:19:31,899 --> 01:19:33,833
Uh, with the ''I'' word.

1591
01:19:33,901 --> 01:19:35,869
It just kind of slipped out.

1592
01:19:35,937 --> 01:19:38,337
But I've been thinking
about it a lot lately,

1593
01:19:38,406 --> 01:19:41,170
and it's how I feel. It's
really important to me--

1594
01:19:41,242 --> 01:19:43,403
Oh, that's really sweet.

1595
01:19:47,214 --> 01:19:48,875
Well, I mean it.

1596
01:19:51,419 --> 01:19:54,650
I know you probably think you do.

1597
01:19:56,390 --> 01:19:59,052
But l-I've been doing
a lot of thinking, too,

1598
01:19:59,126 --> 01:20:01,185
and I'm

1599
01:20:03,464 --> 01:20:05,432
taking anthropology classes.

1600
01:20:05,499 --> 01:20:07,126
And I'm doing a double major.

1601
01:20:07,201 --> 01:20:08,327
Yeah.

1602
01:20:08,402 --> 01:20:10,927
And I'm just... I'm really busy.

1603
01:20:11,105 --> 01:20:13,130
Yeah. Uh, I'm just not...

1604
01:20:14,442 --> 01:20:16,933
I'm not ready for a big commitment.

1605
01:20:17,178 --> 01:20:18,304
Yes, that's...

1606
01:20:18,379 --> 01:20:20,870
[chuckles] That's what I'm saying.

1607
01:20:23,117 --> 01:20:24,550
[sighs]

1608
01:20:28,022 --> 01:20:29,455
Look, when I said I loved you,

1609
01:20:29,523 --> 01:20:33,721
I didn't mean that I wanted
to interfere in your classes

1610
01:20:33,794 --> 01:20:36,354
or, you know, whatever.

1611
01:20:36,430 --> 01:20:41,299
I'm not talking about
marriage or anything yet.

1612
01:20:41,836 --> 01:20:43,963
Carter. Look.

1613
01:20:45,206 --> 01:20:47,174
I've had an amazing time with you,

1614
01:20:47,241 --> 01:20:49,471
and I think you're a great guy.

1615
01:20:50,645 --> 01:20:53,239
But you are on the rebound.

1616
01:20:53,581 --> 01:20:54,673
No, I'm not.

1617
01:20:54,749 --> 01:20:56,376
Carter, you are.

1618
01:20:56,450 --> 01:20:59,977
I mean, it was not that long
ago that your wife left you.

1619
01:21:00,054 --> 01:21:02,079
Best thing that ever happened to me.

1620
01:21:02,156 --> 01:21:03,919
Well, that's great.

1621
01:21:08,696 --> 01:21:12,427
But then that's a good thing
whether you're with me or not.

1622
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:14,865
I think we should
stop seeing each other.

1623

1624

[laughs] Alex, come on.

1625
01:21:32,453 --> 01:21:34,478
I just want you to know

1626
01:21:36,657 --> 01:21:39,217
I enjoyed talking to you more than

1627
01:21:39,827 --> 01:21:42,159
maybe anyone in my entire life.

1628
01:21:45,599 --> 01:21:46,964
Thank you.

1629
01:21:49,704 --> 01:21:51,001
Me, too.

[door opening]

1631
01:22:11,358 --> 01:22:12,655
Dad, where have you been?

1632
01:22:12,727 --> 01:22:13,921
Your cell phone was off.

1633
01:22:13,994 --> 01:22:15,894
I tried to call you
like a thousand times.

1634
01:22:15,963 --> 01:22:17,294
What happened? Where's your mom?

1635
01:22:34,315 --> 01:22:36,078
(Ann) There you are.

1636
01:22:36,484 --> 01:22:37,917
Are you okay?

1637
01:22:38,352 --> 01:22:40,013
I'm fine. Yes, I'm fine.

1638
01:22:40,087 --> 01:22:41,748
The baby's fine.

1639
01:22:42,523 --> 01:22:44,616
I had a little scare.

1640
01:22:45,059 --> 01:22:46,754
There was some bleeding.

1641
01:22:47,695 --> 01:22:49,424
What? What is it?

1642
01:22:50,030 --> 01:22:51,759
A placenta previa.

1643
01:22:52,867 --> 01:22:55,165
It sounds bad, but, uh, it's okay.

1644
01:22:55,236 --> 01:22:56,396
[chuckles]

1645
01:22:56,470 --> 01:22:58,404
I just need some rest.

1646
01:22:59,607 --> 01:23:02,770
If anything ever happened to
you, I'd just have to pack it in.

1647
01:23:02,843 --> 01:23:06,574
Oh, I'm afraid you're going to
be stuck with me for a while.

1648
01:23:11,552 --> 01:23:13,110

[sniffs]

1650
01:23:16,323 --> 01:23:17,950
How's she doing?

1651
01:23:18,626 --> 01:23:19,991
She's okay.

1652
01:23:29,603 --> 01:23:32,003
You know, I broke up with Carter.

1653
01:23:35,442 --> 01:23:36,534
Because of me?

1654
01:23:36,610 --> 01:23:38,976
No. Because of me.

1655
01:23:44,885 --> 01:23:46,910
I'm sorry I lied to you.

1656
01:23:49,023 --> 01:23:51,856
But, you know, I think you should know

1657
01:23:51,926 --> 01:23:54,451
that Carter didn't try
to seduce me or anything.

1658
01:23:54,528 --> 01:23:56,325
If anything, it was
the other way around.

1659
01:23:56,397 --> 01:23:59,025
I really don't want to hear the details.

1660
01:23:59,099 --> 01:24:00,157
[grunts]

1661
01:24:00,234 --> 01:24:04,500
I mean, unless you
want to tell me, and...

1662
01:24:04,905 --> 01:24:06,998
No. No, not particularly.

1663
01:24:07,208 --> 01:24:08,402
Good.

1664
01:24:10,177 --> 01:24:11,439
[sighs]

1665
01:24:12,513 --> 01:24:14,811
You must think I'm disgusting.

1666
01:24:14,915 --> 01:24:16,405
Disgusting?

1667
01:24:17,551 --> 01:24:19,849
Why on earth would I think that?

1668
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:23,117
I didn't know that you
took out a second mortgage.

1669
01:24:23,190 --> 01:24:24,885
I don't need to go to NYU.

1670
01:24:24,959 --> 01:24:26,620
SUNY's fine. It's fine.

1671
01:24:26,694 --> 01:24:29,026
No, no, you are staying at NYU.

1672
01:24:32,333 --> 01:24:33,732
Look, Alex.

1673
01:24:37,004 --> 01:24:40,371
You're a really smart woman.

1674
01:24:42,076 --> 01:24:44,169
And you can take care of yourself.

1675
01:24:44,245 --> 01:24:46,941
And I'm going to try

1676
01:24:48,749 --> 01:24:50,216
and adjust.

1677
01:24:52,586 --> 01:24:54,816
You don't have to change, Dad.

1678
01:24:58,425 --> 01:25:01,258
Yeah. I do.

1679
01:25:15,576 --> 01:25:17,237
[computer beeps]

1680
01:25:19,546 --> 01:25:21,810
It's going to be okay. Muchachos!

1681
01:25:28,455 --> 01:25:30,320
(Teddy K.) Good. Hello,
how are you? I know.

1682
01:25:30,391 --> 01:25:32,359
(Teddy K.) Tell him not
to be late this time.

1683
01:25:32,426 --> 01:25:34,394
(Teddy K.) Hi, how you
doing? Good to see you.

1684
01:25:34,461 --> 01:25:36,395
Hi. Oh, nice brooch.

1685
01:25:36,463 --> 01:25:37,521
Thank you, sir.

1686
01:25:37,598 --> 01:25:39,065
Must be paying her too much money.

1687
01:25:39,133 --> 01:25:40,430
Mark Steckle. Hi.

1688
01:25:40,501 --> 01:25:43,265
Ah, Mark Steckle, how are you?

1689
01:25:43,337 --> 01:25:44,929
Very psyched. How's it going?

1690
01:25:45,005 --> 01:25:46,267
Very good. Good, good.

1691
01:25:46,340 --> 01:25:47,364
Right this way. Hi.

1692
01:25:47,441 --> 01:25:49,306
How you doing? Nice to see you.

1693
01:25:49,376 --> 01:25:50,570
How are you? Good to see you.

1694
01:25:50,644 --> 01:25:51,804
(Teddy K.) Thank you.

1695
01:25:51,879 --> 01:25:53,471
Carter Duryea.

1696
01:25:54,415 --> 01:25:56,474
Oh, yes. Cell phones.

1697
01:25:56,784 --> 01:25:58,411
Yes. Thank you.

1698
01:25:58,485 --> 01:26:00,476
I'm at Sports America now.

1699
01:26:00,554 --> 01:26:02,647
Well, that's the flagship.

1700
01:26:05,159 --> 01:26:07,218
What happened to your eye?

1701
01:26:07,828 --> 01:26:09,887
Yeah, what happened there?

1702
01:26:11,432 --> 01:26:13,764
I fell-- I fell
asleep at my computer.

1703
01:26:13,834 --> 01:26:16,701
Just kind of banged
right into the monitor.

1704
01:26:17,338 --> 01:26:19,101
Those things can be dangerous.

1705
01:26:19,173 --> 01:26:20,731
[all laughing]

1706
01:26:20,808 --> 01:26:23,208
(Teddy K.) Keep up the good work.

1707
01:26:24,178 --> 01:26:25,645
I wouldn't be surprised

1708
01:26:25,713 --> 01:26:27,977
if he announces another
big takeover today.

1709

Teddy K.!

1710
01:26:34,288 --> 01:26:36,381
(Teddy K.) Great to see you. Thank you.

1711
01:26:38,325 --> 01:26:40,156
(Teddy K.) Thank you.

1712
01:26:41,462 --> 01:26:45,125
Synergy. What does it mean?

1713
01:26:47,201 --> 01:26:49,226
(Teddy K.) Why does a
business swim with it

1714
01:26:49,303 --> 01:26:50,770
and sink without it,

1715
01:26:50,838 --> 01:26:53,068
in this new ocean of megabytes,

1716
01:26:53,140 --> 01:26:55,506
streaming video and satellites?

1717
01:26:56,276 --> 01:26:58,039
Every day,

1718
01:26:58,112 --> 01:27:00,444
the world becomes more complex.

1719
01:27:00,881 --> 01:27:03,543
And to survive in a complex world,

1720
01:27:03,617 --> 01:27:07,053
we need complex bonds
to interface with it.

1721
01:27:09,556 --> 01:27:11,353
In this room,

1722
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:15,861
I see this.

1723
01:27:20,567 --> 01:27:24,663
What we're trying to get to, is this.

1724
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:28,938
(Teddy K.) This is unbreakable.

1725
01:27:30,277 --> 01:27:33,075
This is inevitable.

1726
01:27:36,116 --> 01:27:39,210
(Teddy K.) What are we
building here? ls it a company?

1727
01:27:39,286 --> 01:27:43,086
Or are we building a new country
with no national boundaries?

1728
01:27:43,557 --> 01:27:45,991
A new democracy for the consumer.

1729
01:27:46,060 --> 01:27:48,790
A new democracy with a new electorate.

1730
01:27:50,330 --> 01:27:52,992
24-hour music videos in Kuala Lumpur.

1731
01:27:53,067 --> 01:27:55,968
Computers with parts
manufactured in Japan,

1732
01:27:56,036 --> 01:27:58,061
Greenland, ldaho, India.

01:28:01,575 --> 01:28:03,634
to seven different continents.

The Dalai Llama eating
his Krispity Krunch

while uploading prayers onto the Net.

1737
01:28:11,518 --> 01:28:12,951
Woman's World magazine.

1738
01:28:13,020 --> 01:28:16,478
Well, why not Woman's World
Channel across the world?

1739
01:28:16,557 --> 01:28:17,785
Computers.

1740
01:28:17,858 --> 01:28:21,726
Why not a computer section
in Sports America magazine?

1741
01:28:21,862 --> 01:28:23,295
[chuckles]

1742
01:28:24,364 --> 01:28:27,197
(Dan) Uh, excuse me. Excuse me.

1743
01:28:29,036 --> 01:28:30,128
Yes?

1744
01:28:30,437 --> 01:28:31,699
Uh, uh...

1745
01:28:32,973 --> 01:28:35,737
Uh, my name is, uh,
uh, Dan Foreman. l...

1746
01:28:35,943 --> 01:28:40,209
I work for Sports
America and I'm not sure

1747
01:28:40,280 --> 01:28:43,147
l--l understand what
you're talking about.

1748
01:28:45,452 --> 01:28:47,545
(Dan) W-what
I mean is--is

1749
01:28:49,123 --> 01:28:51,557
what do computers
have to do with sports?

1750
01:28:51,625 --> 01:28:54,150
Are you... Are--are
you literally saying

1751
01:28:54,228 --> 01:28:56,719
that there should be a
section in the magazine

1752
01:28:56,797 --> 01:28:58,458
about computers?

1753
01:28:59,766 --> 01:29:02,132
Who's going to want to read that?

1754
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:08,000
Um...

1755
01:29:08,408 --> 01:29:10,069
[clears throat] And, uh...

1756
01:29:10,144 --> 01:29:11,202
[sighs]

1757
01:29:11,278 --> 01:29:13,109
l-I'm not sure I understand

1758
01:29:13,180 --> 01:29:15,171
how the way the world is changing

1759
01:29:15,249 --> 01:29:18,013
is actually going to
change how we do business.

1760
01:29:18,085 --> 01:29:22,283
We're still selling a product, right?

1761
01:29:22,356 --> 01:29:24,483
Which hopefully someone needs.

1762
01:29:24,558 --> 01:29:27,618
We're human beings with other
human beings for customers.

1763
01:29:27,694 --> 01:29:31,960
So I don't see how this
company is like its own country.

1764
01:29:32,032 --> 01:29:35,263
I mean, just because we sell
different kinds of things,

1765
01:29:35,335 --> 01:29:39,135
that doesn't mean we should
operate by our own laws, does it?

1766
01:29:40,908 --> 01:29:44,776
Besides which, countries,
at least democratic ones,

1767
01:29:46,280 --> 01:29:49,807
they have some obligation to
their citizens, don't they?

1768
01:29:50,350 --> 01:29:52,250
(Dan) So how do layoffs

1769
01:29:52,519 --> 01:29:55,181
and bottom line thinking fit into that?

1770

Dan Foreman.

1771
01:30:12,439 --> 01:30:13,997
Sports America.

1772
01:30:16,043 --> 01:30:19,274
You ask some excellent questions.

1773
01:30:19,346 --> 01:30:21,644
Excellent, excellent questions.

1774
01:30:22,282 --> 01:30:24,307
I'm glad you asked them.

1775
01:30:27,354 --> 01:30:29,515
And I'm leaving it to you,

1776
01:30:30,290 --> 01:30:33,259
to all of you, to answer them.

1777
01:30:38,899 --> 01:30:40,025
Hmm.

1778
01:30:49,142 --> 01:30:50,404
Teddy K.!

1779
01:30:51,178 --> 01:30:54,079
(Steckle) Teddy K.! Teddy K.!

1780
01:30:58,118 --> 01:31:00,177
(Carter) Oh, my God, Dan. Oh, my God.

1781
01:31:00,254 --> 01:31:01,846
(Steckle) Good, you're both in here.

1782
01:31:01,922 --> 01:31:03,480
You, I'll talk to in a second.

1783
01:31:03,557 --> 01:31:06,219
You, have you lost your frigging mind?

1784
01:31:06,660 --> 01:31:09,527
Well, he said they were
excellent questions.

1785
01:31:09,596 --> 01:31:11,621
Okay, you think this is funny.

1786
01:31:11,698 --> 01:31:14,496
You think it's funny to
disrespect a great man.

1787
01:31:14,568 --> 01:31:16,798
Do you know who you were
just talking to in there?

1788
01:31:16,870 --> 01:31:19,703
That was Teddy K.!
Teddy K., God damn it!

1789
01:31:21,074 --> 01:31:22,507
Look, we've been carrying

1790
01:31:22,576 --> 01:31:24,510
your fat, bloated
salary for way too long.

1791
01:31:24,578 --> 01:31:26,341
(Steckle) I want you
out of this building

1792
01:31:26,413 --> 01:31:27,471
within the next 10 minutes.

1793
01:31:27,547 --> 01:31:28,946
I'm going to my office.

1794
01:31:29,016 --> 01:31:30,608
I'm going to smoke a nice Cuban cigar

1795
01:31:30,684 --> 01:31:32,481
and try to forget that you ever existed.

1796
01:31:32,552 --> 01:31:34,383
You, in my office now.

1797
01:31:34,454 --> 01:31:36,217
Mark, don't do that.

1798
01:31:37,858 --> 01:31:38,984
Excuse me?

1799
01:31:39,059 --> 01:31:40,185
Look.

1800
01:31:40,294 --> 01:31:41,659
The guy busts
his ass and--

1801
01:31:41,728 --> 01:31:42,820
And what?

1802
01:31:42,896 --> 01:31:44,727
Nothing. I'm sorry.

1803
01:31:46,433 --> 01:31:49,664
(Carter) I just... If you fire him,

1804
01:31:53,273 --> 01:31:55,833
you're going to have to fire me, too.

1805
01:31:58,979 --> 01:32:00,105
Wait.

1806
01:32:00,380 --> 01:32:02,541
Let me get something straight here.

1807
01:32:02,616 --> 01:32:04,914
You're throwing yourself in with him?

1808
01:32:04,985 --> 01:32:08,011
With this useless,
over-the-hill loser?

1809
01:32:08,088 --> 01:32:10,147
Think here. Think
about what you're doing,

1810
01:32:10,223 --> 01:32:13,852
because if you're not careful,
you could end up like him.

1811
01:32:14,394 --> 01:32:18,125
I guess that that would be okay.

1812
01:32:22,669 --> 01:32:24,068
All right.

1813
01:32:24,304 --> 01:32:26,704
Then you're fired, too, you little shit.

1814
01:32:28,141 --> 01:32:29,199
Well, that's too bad,

1815
01:32:29,276 --> 01:32:32,712
'cause, uh, you're gonna lose a huge
account that Dan and I've been working on.

1816
01:32:32,779 --> 01:32:34,178
It was gonna save the year for us.

1817
01:32:34,247 --> 01:32:36,272
Without it, the magazine's
pretty deep in the red.

1818
01:32:36,350 --> 01:32:38,147
Really? What account is that?

1819
01:32:38,218 --> 01:32:39,947
You think we'd actually tell you?

1820
01:32:44,091 --> 01:32:45,718
You're bluffing.

1821
01:32:45,826 --> 01:32:47,350
I don't bluff.

1822
01:32:47,527 --> 01:32:49,017
I'm not that good of a salesman.

1823
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:55,625
Yeah, well, I don't give a crap.

1824
01:32:55,702 --> 01:32:56,964
I think Teddy K. will.

1825
01:32:57,037 --> 01:32:59,164
See, I'm gonna call him
and I'm gonna tell him

1826
01:32:59,239 --> 01:33:01,764
that you single-handedly drove
his most profitable magazine,

1827
01:33:01,842 --> 01:33:04,367
his flagship, right into the ground.

1828
01:33:05,112 --> 01:33:06,636
And he'll remember my name.

1829
01:33:06,713 --> 01:33:08,476
He likes what I did with cell phones.

1830
01:33:19,359 --> 01:33:22,123
You've got 24 hours,
or you're both gone.

1832
01:33:28,935 --> 01:33:30,334
Any ideas?

1833
01:33:31,638 --> 01:33:32,764
One.

1834
01:33:50,624 --> 01:33:52,114
You got all your research?

1835
01:33:52,192 --> 01:33:53,284
Yep.

1836
01:33:54,494 --> 01:33:56,052
Follow my lead.

1837
01:33:57,998 --> 01:33:59,693
(Kalb) So, um, how are your daughters?

1838
01:33:59,766 --> 01:34:01,427
They're great. Thanks.

1839
01:34:01,501 --> 01:34:02,832
How about your grandkids?

1840
01:34:02,903 --> 01:34:04,097
Uh, they're fine.

1841
01:34:04,171 --> 01:34:06,799
My son-in-law has just
enrolled our oldest, Ralphy,

1842
01:34:06,873 --> 01:34:09,899
in a computer camp,
whatever the hell that is.

1843
01:34:10,944 --> 01:34:13,105
Uh, this is my boss, Carter Duryea.

1844
01:34:13,180 --> 01:34:15,341
It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Kalb.

1845
01:34:15,415 --> 01:34:17,406
You have a really awesome company here.

1846
01:34:17,484 --> 01:34:19,645
You... It's a really
awesome, awesome--

1847
01:34:19,719 --> 01:34:22,517
Your boss? He looks
more like your nephew.

1848
01:34:23,156 --> 01:34:25,750
Well, I've, uh, certainly
been learning a lot from Dan.

1849
01:34:25,826 --> 01:34:27,521
So what happened to your eye?

1850
01:34:27,594 --> 01:34:30,154
That's one of the things
he learned from me.

1851
01:34:30,230 --> 01:34:33,597
Are you saying that you
punched him in the eye? Why?

1852
01:34:33,667 --> 01:34:37,296
Well, it's... We don't have
to really go into it here.

1853
01:34:37,370 --> 01:34:40,999
No, no, no, please, please.
I'm--I'm--I'm rather curious.

1854
01:34:42,209 --> 01:34:43,938
Why did I hit you?

1855
01:34:49,282 --> 01:34:50,977
He called me a dinosaur.

1856
01:34:51,051 --> 01:34:52,518
He said I was out of date.

1857
01:34:52,586 --> 01:34:55,077
That I'd better step in line.

1858
01:34:56,223 --> 01:34:57,850
So you slugged him?

1859
01:34:57,924 --> 01:34:59,949
It was a fair fight. Hmm?

1860
01:35:01,394 --> 01:35:02,554
Right.

1861
01:35:03,029 --> 01:35:07,796
Mr. Kalb, we have a sister
company, Krispity Krunch,

1862
01:35:07,868 --> 01:35:10,701
that I think we could do a really
exciting cross-promotion with here,

1863
01:35:10,770 --> 01:35:12,635
all in the GlobeCom
family. Carter, Carter.

1864
01:35:12,706 --> 01:35:14,003
I think that we
could achieve--

1865
01:35:14,074 --> 01:35:15,371
Carter, it's ok. Mr. Kalb,

1866
01:35:15,442 --> 01:35:18,843
I don't want get into facts and figures
with you today. You know them already.

1867
01:35:18,912 --> 01:35:20,641
(Dan) I just want to
ask you one question.

1868
01:35:20,714 --> 01:35:21,874
What is your hesitation

1869
01:35:21,948 --> 01:35:25,008
about advertising with
Sports America magazine?

1870
01:35:28,288 --> 01:35:32,019
My hesitation is that our ad
budget is already overextended.

1871
01:35:32,225 --> 01:35:35,820
My son-in-law has put a lot
of money into cable and online.

1872
01:35:35,896 --> 01:35:39,730
And now he wants to plow even
more money back into it. But...

1873
01:35:39,900 --> 01:35:41,265
But what?

1874
01:35:42,903 --> 01:35:45,371
But he is such an asshole!

1875
01:35:46,172 --> 01:35:47,400
I mean, I built this business.

1876
01:35:47,474 --> 01:35:49,669
I know more about running
this than he ever will.

1877
01:35:49,743 --> 01:35:52,211
So, yeah. I'm gonna make a
major ad buy in your magazine.

1878
01:35:52,279 --> 01:35:54,713
And then I'm gonna restructure
the whole damn ad campaign.

1879
01:35:54,781 --> 01:35:56,544
That is great news. Thank you, Mr. Kalb.

1880
01:35:56,616 --> 01:35:59,449
Oh. Thank... Yes.
Thank you so much, sir.

1881

You know, I don't give a
shit about Krispity Krunch.

1882
01:36:02,188 --> 01:36:04,918
Let's just stick with
the magazine, okay?

1883
01:36:05,926 --> 01:36:07,188
You really slugged him?

1884
01:36:07,260 --> 01:36:08,352
Yeah. Carter.

1885
01:36:10,430 --> 01:36:13,399
Oh, my God. Oh, my
God, that was amazing.

1886
01:36:13,466 --> 01:36:15,366
That was unbelievable!

1887
01:36:15,435 --> 01:36:16,595
God, that was actually fun.

1888
01:36:16,670 --> 01:36:18,137
What Kalb really needed to see

1889
01:36:18,204 --> 01:36:22,334
was an old fart who beat the crap
out of a young punk half his age.

1890
01:36:22,876 --> 01:36:24,867
And you know what the best thing is?

1891
01:36:24,945 --> 01:36:26,572
It's the right thing to do.

1892
01:36:26,646 --> 01:36:28,841
It will improve his business.

1893
01:36:32,519 --> 01:36:34,510
Wow, you actually, uh...

1894
01:36:35,155 --> 01:36:37,783
You actually believe in this stuff, huh?

1895
01:36:37,857 --> 01:36:39,518
Of course I do.

1896

I thought you said Teddy K.
was buying another company.

me, but he sold us.

Yeah. They're reorganizing

01:39:57,557 --> 01:40:00,993
But I think you're a good
manager and a good salesman.

1947
01:40:01,494 --> 01:40:05,055
And I want you to come here
and be my second-in-command.

1948
01:40:06,132 --> 01:40:07,463
Wow, Dan.

1949
01:40:08,368 --> 01:40:10,859
Uh, l... I really appreciate that.

1950
01:40:11,704 --> 01:40:13,934
Uh, more than you know. And l...

1951
01:40:14,007 --> 01:40:16,805
I think if I really want
to do this for a living,

1952
01:40:16,876 --> 01:40:20,437
there's no one I could learn
from more than you. But l...

1953
01:40:23,416 --> 01:40:25,907
Look, I don't know what
I want to do with my life.

1954
01:40:29,189 --> 01:40:32,647
I know that I want it
to mean something to me

1955
01:40:33,960 --> 01:40:36,758
the way that this
means something to you.

1956
01:40:39,566 --> 01:40:41,033
[sighs] Oh.

1957
01:40:43,770 --> 01:40:45,431
God, do you think I'm being stupid?

1958
01:40:46,840 --> 01:40:50,241
No. No. l...

1959
01:40:52,278 --> 01:40:54,337
I think that sounds right.

1960
01:40:59,819 --> 01:41:03,311
So how's the family?

1961
01:41:04,524 --> 01:41:07,288
Uh, Ann's fine.

1962
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:11,093
Uh, the baby's coming
Tuesday after next Tuesday.

1963
01:41:11,164 --> 01:41:13,257
Oh. It's a... It's a cesarean.

1964
01:41:13,333 --> 01:41:14,800
Dan, that's amazing.

1965
01:41:14,868 --> 01:41:16,460
Yeah, it is.

1966
01:41:19,005 --> 01:41:22,463
And, uh, both girls are...

1967
01:41:23,042 --> 01:41:24,805
They're doing well.

1968
01:41:26,846 --> 01:41:28,006
Good.

1969
01:41:30,316 --> 01:41:33,911
Please, uh, give them all my best.

1970
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:35,480
Yeah.

1971
01:41:36,990 --> 01:41:38,048
[sighs]

1972
01:41:38,124 --> 01:41:39,250
Dan.

1973
01:41:41,361 --> 01:41:42,726
Thank you.

1974
01:41:43,630 --> 01:41:44,961
For what?

1975
01:41:45,632 --> 01:41:46,894
For...

1976
01:41:48,968 --> 01:41:51,368
I guess for showing me a few things.

1977
01:41:54,407 --> 01:41:57,103
No one ever really took the time to

1978
01:41:58,344 --> 01:42:00,471
give me a hard time before.

1979
01:42:01,681 --> 01:42:04,548
Or teach me anything that was

1980
01:42:06,920 --> 01:42:08,911
actually worth learning.

1981
01:42:10,023 --> 01:42:11,547
[clears throat]

1982
01:42:12,292 --> 01:42:13,350
All right.

1983
01:42:13,426 --> 01:42:15,417
[sighs] Now listen, Carter.

1984
01:42:15,495 --> 01:42:17,759
I want to tell you something.

1985
01:42:20,300 --> 01:42:22,268
You're going to be okay.

1986
01:42:22,969 --> 01:42:24,368
You think so?

1987
01:42:24,437 --> 01:42:26,098
Yeah. I know it.

1988
01:42:31,010 --> 01:42:32,739
You're a good man.

1989
01:42:46,559 --> 01:42:47,890
[sighs]

1990
01:42:48,394 --> 01:42:49,691
[sniffs]

1991
01:42:53,566 --> 01:42:55,363
Don't be a stranger.

1992

[elevator bell dings]

1993
01:43:01,274 --> 01:43:02,400
Morty?

1994
01:43:02,475 --> 01:43:03,999
Hey! You're back!

1995
01:43:04,077 --> 01:43:06,409
Yeah, back in the saddle.

1996
01:43:07,246 --> 01:43:09,146
And look at you.
You're--you're...

1997
01:43:09,215 --> 01:43:11,445
You look like a delivery guy.

1998
01:43:14,153 --> 01:43:16,713
Oh, do you know Dan's daughter Alex?

1999
01:43:17,290 --> 01:43:19,781
Yeah. What are you doing here?

2000
01:43:20,226 --> 01:43:23,252
I'm surprising my dad. Tennis.

2001
01:43:23,896 --> 01:43:26,023
(Morty) Alex is a
fantastic tennis player.

2002
01:43:26,099 --> 01:43:28,226
She was a junior champ, right?

2003
01:43:28,301 --> 01:43:31,566
Really? Oh, you're into...
You're into tennis, huh?

2004
01:43:31,637 --> 01:43:32,831
Yeah.

2005
01:43:34,540 --> 01:43:36,235
How is everything?

2006
01:43:37,410 --> 01:43:39,071
Good. Really...

2007
01:43:40,380 --> 01:43:41,847
Really good.

2008
01:43:42,048 --> 01:43:44,346
Um, I'm leaving town, actually.

2009
01:43:44,484 --> 01:43:46,145
I think I'm going to try teaching

2010
01:43:46,219 --> 01:43:48,915
or, um, maybe open an Awapuhi store.

2011
01:43:48,988 --> 01:43:51,183
[chuckles] I don't know. Uh...

2012
01:43:52,325 --> 01:43:53,690
How are you doing?

2013
01:43:53,760 --> 01:43:55,990
(Alex) Good. Very good.

2014
01:43:57,130 --> 01:44:00,190
I've been working on some short stories.

2015
01:44:00,600 --> 01:44:02,898
Oh. That's awesome.

2016
01:44:05,438 --> 01:44:08,271
Well, I got a raise. Dan got me a raise.

2017
01:44:08,374 --> 01:44:11,571
Which is a good thing, because
my wife just got laid off.

2018
01:44:11,644 --> 01:44:13,236
Timing's everything in life, right?

2019
01:44:13,312 --> 01:44:15,337
[elevator bell dings] Right.

2020
01:44:15,415 --> 01:44:18,009
Well, good seeing
you. Take care, Carter.

2021
01:44:18,084 --> 01:44:21,986
Yeah. Look, it was really
great seeing both you guys.

2022
01:44:22,989 --> 01:44:25,116
You, too, Carter. It was...

2023
01:44:25,191 --> 01:44:27,489
It was really good to see you.

2024
01:44:34,467 --> 01:44:35,627
Bye.

2025
01:44:51,484 --> 01:44:52,781
Hi, guys.

2026
01:44:53,486 --> 01:44:54,612
Well?

2027
01:44:55,054 --> 01:44:56,146
Yes?

2028
01:44:57,857 --> 01:45:01,020
Wel, I'm delighted to say

2029
01:45:03,396 --> 01:45:05,159
that you have a baby sister.

2030
01:45:05,231 --> 01:45:06,562
[chuckles]

2031
01:45:07,667 --> 01:45:09,430
Are you happy, Dad?

2032
01:45:10,369 --> 01:45:12,064
Yeah, I'm psyched.

2033
01:45:21,681 --> 01:45:23,444
[cell phone rings]

2034
01:45:23,749 --> 01:45:26,047
Hello. Dan! Hey.

2035
01:45:26,119 --> 01:45:28,519
Oh, my God. Congratulations.
It's amazing.

2036
01:45:28,588 --> 01:45:30,419
Do you have a name yet?

2037
01:45:30,490 --> 01:45:32,617
Oh, no, that's terrific.

2038
01:45:33,659 --> 01:45:36,059
Uh, probably because I'm jogging.

2039
01:45:36,896 --> 01:45:38,193
No, I'm outside.

2040
01:45:38,264 --> 01:45:41,062
Yes. I'm actually jogging outside.

2041
01:45:42,268 --> 01:45:44,429
Please Playa del Rey. Don't laugh.

2042
01:45:44,504 --> 01:45:45,698
Remember me

2043
01:45:45,771 --> 01:45:47,762
I'm thinking about getting into...

2044
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:49,432
Happily

2045
01:45:51,010 --> 01:45:53,444
By the rose bush

2046
01:45:53,513 --> 01:45:58,450
Laughing with roses on my chin

2047
01:46:00,319 --> 01:46:02,253
The time when

2048
01:46:03,656 --> 01:46:06,648
we counted every black car

2049
01:46:06,726 --> 01:46:11,220
passing your house beneath the hill

2050
01:46:12,999 --> 01:46:15,092
and up until

2051
01:46:16,335 --> 01:46:19,668
someone caught us in the kitchen

2052
01:46:20,173 --> 01:46:22,539
with knives

2053
01:46:22,642 --> 01:46:24,701
A mountain range

2054
01:46:25,945 --> 01:46:28,311
A piggy bank

2055
01:46:29,248 --> 01:46:32,911
A vision to removed to mention

2056
01:46:32,985 --> 01:46:37,513
But, please, remember me

2057
01:46:38,658 --> 01:46:40,421
fondly

2058
01:46:41,727 --> 01:46:45,720
I heard from someone you're still pretty

2059
01:46:45,798 --> 01:46:47,595
And then

2060
01:46:47,667 --> 01:46:50,033
they went on to say

2061
01:46:50,903 --> 01:46:53,633
that the pearly gates

2062
01:46:54,774 --> 01:46:58,608
are so eloquently repeated

2063
01:46:58,678 --> 01:47:03,547
Like words I've lost and found

2064
01:47:03,950 --> 01:47:06,783
And don't look down

2065
01:47:07,253 --> 01:47:11,690
And someone save temptation

2066
01:47:11,757 --> 01:47:13,384
And, please

2067
01:47:13,459 --> 01:47:18,089
remember me silently

2068
01:47:19,966 --> 01:47:24,062
In the car behind the corner

2069
01:47:24,370 --> 01:47:26,031
you hold my hand

2070
01:47:26,172 --> 01:47:29,300
between your knees

2071
01:47:29,375 --> 01:47:31,900
You turn from me

2072
01:47:32,678 --> 01:47:36,944
Said the trapeze, it was wonderful

2073
01:47:37,016 --> 01:47:41,419
But never meant to last

2074
01:47:42,054 --> 01:47:45,285
The clouds have passed

2075
01:47:45,358 --> 01:47:48,486
So we just come up with anger

2076
01:47:48,561 --> 01:47:51,359
And then

2077
01:47:51,430 --> 01:47:54,399
The circus moved

2078
01:47:54,467 --> 01:47:57,868
The parking lot

2079
01:47:58,137 --> 01:48:01,766
Hiding out, a hint of danger

2080
01:48:01,841 --> 01:48:06,039
So, please, remember me

2081
01:48:07,246 --> 01:48:10,010
fondly

2082
01:48:10,516 --> 01:48:15,453
You're my uphill crawl, my dear

2083
01:48:16,722 --> 01:48:19,589
But if I make

2084

the pearly gates

2085
01:48:23,629 --> 01:48:28,566
Do my best to make a drawing of God

2086
01:48:29,468 --> 01:48:32,494
And Lucifer

A boy and girl

An angel kissin' on a silkscreen of Mars

01:48:42,014 --> 01:48:44,812
The aftermath

2090

A marching band

2091
01:48:48,721 --> 01:48:53,249
All around the fray
just trapeze swinging
