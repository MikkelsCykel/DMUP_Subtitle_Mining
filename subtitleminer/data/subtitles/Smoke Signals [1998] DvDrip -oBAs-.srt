Well, it was nothin'. l--

48

You saved Thomas.

<i>Arnold Joseph mourned

grew it long again.</i>

55
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:34,603
<i>For years after that
he threatened to vanish.</i>

56
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:37,335
<i>He practiced vanishing.</i>

57
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:41,379
<i>Until one day, he jumped
into his yellow pickup...</i>

58
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:43,381

<i>[ Randy ] Good morning.

<i>And Coeur d'A lene people,

at the Crossroads since 1972.</i>

68
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:17,216
So Lester, how's traffic
out there this fine morning?

69
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,979
A couple of cars
went by earlier.

70
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:23,783
You know old Mrs. Joe?
She was speeding.

71
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:27,621
And, uh,
Kimmy and James, uh...

72
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:30,628
they went by in a yellow
car, and they were arguin'.

73
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,633
- Ain't no traffic really.
- [ Randy ] There you go, folks.

74
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:40,467
Looks like nobody's getting to work
on time this morning.

75
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:43,423
As for you school kids, you'd better
hurry up and eat those Wheaties...

76
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:45,471
because the first bell
rang 15 minutes ago.

00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:56,787
Come on.

Game point, cuz!

Bring it on.

83
00:06:10,367 --> 00:06:11,665
Foul!

84
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:14,630
I said, foul.

85
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:18,135
- It's foul.
- Bullshit.

86
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:21,004
I was nowhere
near you.

87
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:25,475
If I say it's a foul,
it's a foul.

88
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:32,523
Hey, Thomas.
Give us some help, huh?

89
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,623
Nice suit, Thomas.

90
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,632
[ Man ]
Sheesh.

Victor!

92
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:54,371
Hey, Victor, what do
you know about fire?

93
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:58,494
- Thomas, I don't know
what you're talking about.
- No, really, Victor.

94
00:06:58,529 --> 00:07:00,718
I mean, did you know
things burn in colors?

95
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,879
I mean,
sodium burns yellow...

96
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:05,822
and carbon burns orange,
just like that.

97
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:09,884
Hey, Victor, heard your dad's living
in Phoenix, Arizona, now.

98
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:14,160
Man, he's lived everywhere
since he left you, huh?

99
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,360
Is that so, Thomas?

100
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:18,835
You know,
I was wondering, Thomas.

101
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:22,840
What color do you think your mom
and dad were when they burned up?

102
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:28,972
You know,
your dad ain't comin' back.

103
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:31,174
- Yes, he is.
- No.

104
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:34,776
He's gone. When Indians go away,
they don't come back.

[ Victor]
Oh, I took the ball to the hoop

108
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:47,331

And what did i see

111

General George Armstrong Custer

A-guardin' me

113

Hey, Victor, who do you think
is the greatest basketball player ever?

114
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:07,442
That's easy: Geronimo.

115
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:10,283
Geronimo? He couldn't
play basketball, man.

116
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:14,951
He was Apache, man.
Those suckers are about three feet tall.

117
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:18,087
lt's Geronimo, man.
He was lean, mean and bloody.

118
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:20,427
He would've dunked on your
flat lndian ass and cut it off.

119
00:08:21,941 --> 00:08:23,434
Yeah, some days
it's a good day to die.

120
00:08:24,301 --> 00:08:26,266
Some days, it's a good day

Hey, Victor.

What about your dad?

123
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:35,846

Your mom said

That ain't enough money

But what do you get
out of the deal?

153
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:33,431
You have to take me with you.

You're funny.

Ain't it cool?

Nah, you keep it.

Hey, Thomas!

159
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:03,195
You'd better get home.

in your ear, see?

00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:20,377
Go ahead, take it.

Hello?
Hello?

Happy lndependence Day,
Victor.

166
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:31,785
You feelin'
independent today?

00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:34,451
l'm feelin' independent.

168

l'm feelin' extra magical today,
like l could make anything disappear.

you know?

170
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:47,230
Poof. Wave my hand,
and poof.

171

Wave my hand
and the reservation is gone.

The trading post
and the post office.

178

The tribal school
and the pine trees.

And the drunks.

180

The Catholics
and the drunk Catholics. Poof!

And all the little lndian boys
named Victor!

Poof.

Here, give me that beer.

- Look what you did!
- [ Groaning ]

187

Just quit your cryin'.
l didn't hit you that hard.

188
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:05,379
Go in the house.
Tell your mama l'll be right in.

189
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,068
Did you cash the check?

190
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:33,077
Yeah.

191
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,215
That's all the money l got.

Oh, this damn arthritis.

Hurtin' bad today, ain't it?

00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:54,631
Nah.

[ Woman ]
l don't trust him, you know?

197
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:05,309
He's mean to you.

198
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:11,047
He wasn't always mean.

199
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:25,662
You know, Thomas said
he'll give me the money...

200
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:28,096
but he wants
to go with me.

201
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:35,167
You know, people always told me
l make the best fry bread in the world.

202
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:38,141
Maybe it's true.

203
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:41,145
But l don't make it
by myself, you know.

204
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,979
l got the recipe
from your grandmother...

205
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:47,814
and she got it
from her grandmother.

206
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,684
And l listen to people
when they eat my bread.

207
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:57,124
You know, they might say, uh,
"Arlene... there's too much flour."

208
00:14:57,229 --> 00:15:02,333
Or, "Arlene... you should
knead your dough some more."

209
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:04,334
l listen to them.

210
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:07,599
And l watch that Julia Child
all the time.

211

She's a good cook too,
but she gets lots of help.

212
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:18,981
So, do you think
l should go with Thomas?

213
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,712
That's your decision.

214

But if you go, l want you
to promise me you'll come back.

- Come on, Mom.
- Promise me!

216

[ Chuckles ] Geez. Want me
to sign a paper or somethin'

217
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:37,733
No way. You know how lndians
feel about signing papers.

218
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,692
[ Victor ] Okay, Thomas, l need
the money, and you can come with me...

219
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,828
but l have a few rules.

220
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:16,339
First of all, you can't
wear that stupid suit.

221
00:16:19,649 --> 00:16:22,344
And secondly, l don't want
you tellin' me a million
of your damn stories.

222
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:25,389
And third, we're goin' right there
and comin' right back.

223
00:16:27,562 --> 00:16:30,186
Good morning. This is
Randy Peone on KREZ Radio...

224
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:32,689
and l just got a news
bulletin here that says...

225
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:36,522
Frenchy Sidejohn won $5,000
last night playing bingo.

226
00:16:36,814 --> 00:16:38,528
l want to congratulate
Frenchy...

227
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:42,361
and all those used car dealers
in Spokane are eagerly awaiting
your arrival.

228
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:46,598
lt's 7:35 a.m., lndian time,
and time for the weather report.

229
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:50,266
Lester here. One of the clouds
up there looks like a horse.

230
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:52,469
And the other one
looks like, uh--

231

You know that, um, tavern
we used to go, the log one?

232

And that waitress there?
Hola. Looks like her.

Well, there you have it...

234
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:04,685
from tribal meteorologist
Lester Fallsapart.

235
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,657
And l just received a request
from lrvin in DeSmet.

236
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,660
He wants to hear
a sad song.

237
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:19,660
 Oh, man!

238
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:21,967
l love this song!

239
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:24,907
- Geez, you love every song.
- No, no. l mean it.

240
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:28,878
I really love this song.

Geez, l'm thirsty.

242
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:33,183
Give me a beer.

243
00:17:34,357 --> 00:17:36,584
Hey, girl,
we don't drink no more.

244
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:39,054
- Remember?
- That's right, ain't it?

245
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:41,422
Well, give me a Coke.

246
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:44,928
There you go,
Lucy-goosey.

247
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:47,157
Have a Coke, eh?

248
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:50,858
Hey, watch where
you're goin'! Geez!

249
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:53,767

where l'm goin'.

00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:04,443
Hey, that's Victor
and Thomas.

251
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:09,587
Hey.

252
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:12,350
Hey, Victor,
sorry to hear about your dad.

253
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:16,292
- You need a ride?
- Oh, yeah.

254
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:18,989
Hey, Thomas.
Need a ride?

255
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:22,033
- You bet.
- What are you gonna trade for it?

256
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:26,070
We're lndians, remember?
We barter.

257
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:28,662
- A story.
- Better be good.

258
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,038
Better be good.

259
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:40,576
Durin' the '60s, Arnold Joseph
was the perfect hippie...

260
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:43,655
because all the hippies were
tryin' to be lndians anyway.

261
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:46,918
But because of that, he was always
wonderin' how anybody would know...

262
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:50,188
when an lndian was tryin'
to make a social statement.

263
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:52,195
But there's proof, you know.

264
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:55,698
Back durin' the Vietnam War,
he was demonstratin' against it...

265
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,826
and there was
this photographer there.

266
00:18:57,936 --> 00:19:01,770
He took a picture of Arnold that day,
and it made it onto the wire services...

267
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:05,833
and was reprinted in newspapers
throughout the country.

268
00:19:05,944 --> 00:19:09,141
lt even made it to the cover
of Time magazine.

269
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:13,446
ln that photograph, Arnold is wearin'
bell-bottoms and a flowered shirt...

270
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:16,214
his hair in braids,
with red peace symbols...

271
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:19,290
splashed across his face
like war paint.

272
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:22,656
He holds a rifle above his head,
captured in that moment...

273
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:25,730
just before he proceeded
to beat the shit out of...

274
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,925
the National Guard private
lyin' on the ground beneath him.

275
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,231
Another demonstrator holds
a sign, 

276
00:19:31,232 --> 00:19:33,528
just barely visible
over his left shoulder.

277
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:37,040
lt reads:
"Make love, not war."

278
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:40,270
Geez. Did your dad
really do that?

279
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:42,279
Thomas, you're so full of shit.

280
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:44,281
[ Lucy ]
Oh, then what happened?

281
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:47,250
Arnold got arrested, you know.
But he got lucky.

282
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,946
At first they charged him
with attempted murder...

283
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:51,294
but then they plea-bargained 

284
00:19:51,295 --> 00:19:53,115
that
down to assault with a deadly weapon.

285
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:57,924
And then they plea-bargained
that down to bein' an lndian
in the twentieth century.

286
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,760
- Then he got two years in Walla Walla.
- [ Girls Sigh ]

287
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:03,266
So, what do you think?

288
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:06,633
Well...

289
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:10,680
l think it's a fine example
of the oral tradition.

290
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:47,305
- You two guys got your passports?
- Passports?

291
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:50,381
Yeah. You're leavin' the res...

and goin' into a whole
different country, cousin.

293
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:55,552
But it's the United States.

294
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:59,385
Damn right, it is. That's
as foreign as it gets.

295
00:20:59,491 --> 00:21:02,119
Hope you two
got your vaccinations.

296

[ Cathy ]
l don't mean to brag...

322
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:03,530
but l was every bit
as good as Mary Lou.

323
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:05,701
ln 1984 l tried out again...

324
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:07,792
and Mary Lou
beat me that time...

325
00:24:07,827 --> 00:24:10,480
but l had grown, you know?

326
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:15,178
Oh! Those little people!
They get all the attention.

327
00:24:16,256 --> 00:24:18,689
Me? l put my whole life

into makin' the Olympics...

329

Geez. You gymnasts got a lot in common
with us lndians then, ain't it?

331
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:30,357
Hey. Hi.

332
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:33,495
You said you were an alternate
for the team, right?

333
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:36,039
- Yeah.
- Well...

334
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:38,609
if you were an alternate,
then you'd only compete...

335
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:40,811
if somebody was hurt
or something, right?

336
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:44,448
- Yeah.
- Was anybody hurt?

337
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:45,969
-No.

338
00:24:47,088 --> 00:24:49,153
Then you really weren't
on the team, were you?

339
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:51,822
l mean, it didn't really matter
if there was a boycott or not.

340
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:54,389
You were stayin' home anyways.

341
00:24:56,294 --> 00:24:58,395
You ain't got nothin'
to complain about...

342
00:24:58,396 --> 00:25:00,928
so why don't you
just be quiet?

343
00:25:12,744 --> 00:25:15,312
What'd you do that for?
She was nice.

344
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:17,548
Nice, my ass.
She was a liar.

345
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:20,918
- No, she wasn't .
- Yes, she was. Think about it, Thomas.

346
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:24,288
What would a big-shot Olympic
gymnast be doing on a bus?

347
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:27,558
- Answer me that, Thomas.
- l don't know.

348
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:30,160
You know, Thomas, you
really need to grow up.

349
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:32,329
Don't you know anything?
People are awful.

350
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:34,932
They'll rob you blind
if you ain't watching.

Where's your piggy bank?
You still got your piggy bank?

Yeah.

Just remember, Thomas:
You can't trust anybody.

378
00:28:06,985 --> 00:28:10,086
Thomas, l've heard this
story a thousand times, okay?

379
00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:14,725
Yeah, it was the summer he left.

380
00:28:14,726 --> 00:28:18,028
We were 12, ain't it?
l had this dream, you know?

381
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:22,700
And this dream told me to go to
Spokane to stand by the falls.

382
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:25,235
You know, those ones
by the Y.M.C.A.

383
00:28:25,236 --> 00:28:27,805
So l walked there.

384
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:31,709
l mean, l didn't have no
car, l didn't have no license.

l was 12 years old.

386
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:37,114
lt took me all day,
but l walked there...

387
00:28:37,115 --> 00:28:40,250
and l stood on that
bridge over the falls...

388
00:28:40,251 --> 00:28:42,651
waitin' for a sign.

389
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:49,118
l must've been waitin'
there for a couple hours.

390
00:28:50,428 --> 00:28:52,777
But l just watched the water.

391
00:28:53,164 --> 00:28:56,249
lt was beautiful.

392
00:28:56,801 --> 00:28:58,773
l kept hopin' l'd see some salmon, .

393
00:28:58,808 --> 00:29:00,801
but
there ain't any salmon in that river no more

394
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:09,980
And then
l heard this voice.

395
00:29:09,981 --> 00:29:12,382
"Hey, what the hell
you doin' here?"

396
00:29:12,383 --> 00:29:16,820
lt was your dad,
yellin' at me.

"l asked you what the hell
you're doin' here."

So l told him l was
waitin' for a vision...

and he just laughed.

get around here is mugged."

00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:01,528
You gotta look mean, or
people won't respect you.

463
00:36:01,792 --> 00:36:05,314
White people will run all over
you if you don't look mean.

464
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,197
You gotta look
like a warrior.

465
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:11,548
You gotta look like you just
came back from killing a buffalo.

466
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:15,411
- But our tribe never hunted
buffalo. We were fishermen.

467
00:36:15,514 --> 00:36:19,254
What? You wanna look like you
just came back from catching a fish?

468
00:36:19,577 --> 00:36:22,745
This ain't
Dances With Salmon, you know.

469
00:36:23,069 --> 00:36:25,372
Thomas, you gotta
look like a warrior.

470
00:36:28,085 --> 00:36:30,418
There.
That's better.

471
00:36:31,222 --> 00:36:34,024
And second, you gotta
know how to use your hair.

472
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:36,026
- My hair?
- Yeah.

473
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:40,182
l mean, look at your hair. lt's all
braided up and stuff. You gotta free it.

474
00:36:40,594 --> 00:36:43,198
An lndian man ain't
nothing without his hair.

475
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:45,535
And last...

476
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:47,783
you gotta get rid
of that suit, Thomas.

477
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:51,592
You just have to.

478
00:37:43,989 --> 00:37:45,228
Um, 'scuse me.

479
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:47,903
Those are our seats.

480
00:37:51,138 --> 00:37:53,109
You mean,
these were your seats.

481
00:37:53,911 --> 00:37:55,525
No, that's not
what he means.

482
00:37:56,807 --> 00:37:58,565
Now listen up.

483
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:02,261
These are our seats now, and there
ain't a damn thing you can do about it.

484
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:05,081
So why don't you
and Super lnjun there...

485
00:38:05,082 --> 00:38:08,351
find yourself someplace
else to have a powwow.

486
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:09,789
Okay?

487
00:38:18,736 --> 00:38:20,688
[ Man ] Come on, now, boys.
Just sit down.

488
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:43,520
Geez, Victor, l--

489
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:45,755
l guess your warrior look
doesn't work every time.

490
00:38:45,756 --> 00:38:47,856
Shut up, Thomas.

491
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:56,232
[ Thomas ]
Man, the cowboys always win.

492
00:38:56,233 --> 00:38:58,735
The cowboys don't always win.

493
00:38:58,736 --> 00:39:02,472
Yeah, they do.
The cowboys always win.

494
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:04,474
Look at Tom Mix.

495
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,973
[ Thomas ]
What about John Wayne?

496
00:39:07,111 --> 00:39:10,146
Man, he was about the toughest
cowboy of them all, ain't it?

497
00:39:11,202 --> 00:39:12,916
You know,
in all those movies...

498
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:16,019
you never saw
John Wayne's teeth.

499
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,795
Not once.

500
00:39:18,322 --> 00:39:22,652
l think there's something wrong
when you don't see a guy's teeth.

501
00:39:30,801 --> 00:39:37,958
John Wayne's teeth Hey-ya

502
00:39:38,776 --> 00:39:46,085
[ Thomas joines in ]
John Wayne's teeth, hey-ya
John Wayne's teeth, hey-ya

503
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:50,453
Are they false Are they real

504
00:39:50,454 --> 00:39:54,491
Are they plastic Are they steel

505
00:39:57,695 --> 00:40:00,263
John Wayne's teeth Are they plastic

506
00:40:00,264 --> 00:40:03,366
Are they steel

507

<i>and our final destination:
Los Angeles, California.</i>

513
00:40:41,172 --> 00:40:43,602
So what do we do now?

514
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:48,039
What do you think?
We walk.

515
00:40:58,346 --> 00:40:59,255
Hey, Victor...

516
00:40:59,256 --> 00:41:02,397
did you know l was an alternate
on the 1980 Olympic team?

517
00:41:06,229 --> 00:41:08,264
How long you think it'll
take us to get there?

518
00:41:08,795 --> 00:41:10,266
We get there when we get there, okay?

519
00:41:10,467 --> 00:41:14,207
l mean, l just wanna know if you have
any idea how long it's going to take.

520
00:41:15,138 --> 00:41:17,584
We've been travelin'
a long time, ain't it?

521
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:19,776
l mean,
Columbus shows up...

522
00:41:19,777 --> 00:41:22,886
and we start walkin' away from
that beach, tryin' to get away.

523
00:41:23,581 --> 00:41:25,982
And then Custer moves
into the neighborhood...

524
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:28,618
drivin' down all the
property values and--

525
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:30,750
And we gotta
keep on walkin'.

526
00:41:31,055 --> 00:41:34,057
Then old Harry Truman drops the bomb...

527
00:41:34,058 --> 00:41:36,656
and we gotta keep on walkin' somewhere.

528
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:40,018
'Cept it's all bright now, and we
can see exactly where we're goin'.

529
00:41:41,232 --> 00:41:44,801
Hey! And then we get a
beach house on the moon.

530
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:49,117
But old Neil Armstrong shows
up and boots us off into space.

531
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:53,076
Then your mom gets that phone
call about your dad bein' dead...

532
00:41:53,077 --> 00:41:57,197
and geez, your dad's gotta
be livin' in Mars, Arizona.

533
00:41:57,915 --> 00:42:01,885
And we ain't got no
money, no car, no horse.

534
00:42:02,051 --> 00:42:04,546
We have to catch the bus
all the way down here.

Nobody can help us.

Not even Charles Bronson, man.

538

Hey, did you ever notice how your
dad looks like Charles Bronson?

539
00:42:18,463 --> 00:42:21,604
Thomas, my dad doesn't look
anything like Charles Bronson, okay?

540
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:24,246
Yeah, your dad looks
like Charles Bronson.

541
00:42:24,775 --> 00:42:27,631
Not the Charlie Bronson of
the first Death Wish movie.

542
00:42:34,151 --> 00:42:36,819
No, your dad's more
like Death Wish V...

543
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:40,023
the one where Charlie Bronson
fights that Asian death gang.

l haven't talked to

Are you a nurse or somethin'

l used to be a nurse, but now
l'm a hospital administrator.

576
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:54,775
What does that mean?

577
00:45:55,467 --> 00:45:57,475
lt means l travel too much.

578
00:45:57,988 --> 00:46:00,155
- l bet you've been everywhere then, ain't it?

579
00:46:00,624 --> 00:46:03,527
l've been a lot of
places since l left home.

580
00:46:03,961 --> 00:46:05,407
So where's home then?

581
00:46:06,797 --> 00:46:09,813
- New York.
- Hey, Suzy.

582
00:46:09,848 --> 00:46:12,835
- This is pretty good bread.
- Yeah, it's okay.

583
00:46:12,918 --> 00:46:16,802
Hey, Victor, you should try some.
lt's almost as good as your mom's .

584
00:46:16,837 --> 00:46:18,808
Ain't no bread good as Mom's .

585
00:46:19,218 --> 00:46:20,570
This is pretty close.

586
00:46:32,523 --> 00:46:33,844
lt's okay.

587
00:46:34,992 --> 00:46:37,493
Ain't even close to Mom's , though.

588
00:46:37,594 --> 00:46:40,863
Victor's mom makes the best
fry bread in the whole world.

589
00:46:41,264 --> 00:46:42,332
Really?

590
00:46:42,613 --> 00:46:45,222
lt's so good, they use it
for Communion back home.

591

Arlene Joseph makes
some Jesus fry bread.

592
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:52,205
Fry bread that can walk across water.

593
00:46:52,412 --> 00:46:55,133
Fry bread
risin' from the dead.

594
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:57,740
ls that true?



596
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:02,388
Come on.
ls that true?

597
00:47:06,623 --> 00:47:11,030
Way back when, we were havin'
a feast on our reservation.

598
00:47:11,065 --> 00:47:12,461
A good old feast.

599
00:47:12,462 --> 00:47:14,463
We didn't have
a whole lot of food...

600
00:47:14,464 --> 00:47:19,368
just a little bit of deer meat,
a huge vat of mashed potatoes...

601
00:47:19,369 --> 00:47:22,330
some Coke
and fry bread.

602
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:26,175
But the fry bread
made all the difference in the world.

603
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:28,678
You see, a good piece
of fry bread...

604
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:31,013
turned any meal into a feast.

605
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:33,516
Everybody sat
at the tables...

606
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:36,519
waitin' for the cooks to
come with the fry bread.

607
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,821
They waited...

608
00:47:38,822 --> 00:47:41,190
and waited...

609
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:44,460
but you see, there was a
hundred lndians at that feast...

610
00:47:44,461 --> 00:47:48,197
and only 50 pieces
of fry bread.

611
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:51,100
Arlene kept tryin'
to figure out what to do.

612
00:47:51,101 --> 00:47:55,511
l mean, it was her magical fry
bread that everybody wanted.

613
00:47:55,511 --> 00:47:58,107
But Arlene knew what to do.

614
00:47:58,108 --> 00:48:02,311
You see, Arlene's
fry bread was magic.

615
00:48:02,312 --> 00:48:05,147
Arlene was magic.

616
00:48:05,148 --> 00:48:08,017
She knew how to feed
a hundred lndians...

617
00:48:08,018 --> 00:48:11,020
with only 50 pieces
of fry bread.

618
00:48:11,021 --> 00:48:14,056
She went out
to talk to the people.

619
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:16,626
"Listen!" she said.

620
00:48:16,627 --> 00:48:19,495
"There are one hundred lndians here...

621
00:48:19,496 --> 00:48:23,532
and only 50 pieces
of fry bread!"

622
00:48:23,533 --> 00:48:26,012
Everybody was mad.

623
00:48:26,047 --> 00:48:28,771
There was gonna be a
fry bread riot for sure.

624
00:48:28,772 --> 00:48:30,773
But then Arlene said...

625
00:48:30,774 --> 00:48:34,777
"But l have a way to feed you all!"

626
00:48:34,778 --> 00:48:39,829
She took a piece of fry bread,
she held it over her head...

627
00:48:40,241 --> 00:48:42,358
and she ripped it in half!

628
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:49,391
Oh, that's a good story.

629
00:48:50,213 --> 00:48:50,993
ls that true?

630
00:48:50,994 --> 00:48:54,397
Hmm? ls that true?

631
00:48:54,398 --> 00:48:57,958
No, it's not true. Thomas,
you're so full of shit.

632
00:48:58,802 --> 00:49:01,270
So l told you a story.
Now it's your turn.

633
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:04,607
What? Do you want lies,
or do you want the truth?

634
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:07,410
l want both.

635
00:49:07,411 --> 00:49:10,471
Tell us how you met
Victor's dad, anyway.

636
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:15,785
Well...

637
00:49:16,481 --> 00:49:19,121
you know, l just moved
here a couple years back...

638
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:22,258
and l saw him puttering around a lot.

639
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:24,935
He was always workin'
on that truck, you know?

640
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:31,310
l didn't have a car back then,
so sometimes he'd give me a ride.

641
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:33,633
Geez. This hardly ever happens.

642
00:49:35,238 --> 00:49:37,047
lt starts almost every time.

643
00:49:40,935 --> 00:49:42,142
Come on.

644
00:49:44,281 --> 00:49:47,303
Well, may as well walk home.

645
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:49,645
- You sure you don't
want me to grab those?
- Oh, no, no.

646
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:52,708
- l-l think l can make it.
- lt's a long walk.

647
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,861
Hey, where are
you from, man?

648
00:49:59,062 --> 00:50:01,162
Plummer, ldaho.

649
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:05,465
You know, l got me a
ex-wife and a son up there.

650
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:07,914
What are you doin'
down here then?

651
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:10,681
l don't know.

652
00:50:12,442 --> 00:50:14,739
Guess l'm still tryin'
to figure that out.

653
00:50:18,782 --> 00:50:21,117
Suzy...

654
00:50:21,118 --> 00:50:22,992
what's the worst thing you ever did?

655
00:50:24,087 --> 00:50:25,579
[ Chuckles ]
What do you mean?

656
00:50:26,256 --> 00:50:28,491
l mean, what's the--

657
00:50:28,492 --> 00:50:31,120
the most evil thing you
ever done to another person?

658
00:50:31,595 --> 00:50:34,568
Oh, l don't know if
l wanna answer that.

659
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:36,146
Come on. Tell me.

660
00:50:39,835 --> 00:50:42,232
[ Chuckles ]
Uh, let's see.

661
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:47,467
This one time at a powwow...

662
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:49,977
l stole
this old lndian woman's purse.

663
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:55,549
There-- There was like
a couple of hundred bucks in there...

664
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:57,533
and l spent it all.

665
00:50:58,355 --> 00:51:01,212
And that was probably all
of her powwow money too.

666
00:51:01,758 --> 00:51:03,755
l bet she just cried.

667
00:51:04,761 --> 00:51:06,684
Yeah, that's bad.

668
00:51:09,966 --> 00:51:12,184
There's gotta be somethin'
worse than that, ain't it?

669
00:51:13,303 --> 00:51:15,601
Aw, come on. What about you?
lt's your turn.

670
00:51:15,705 --> 00:51:17,536
What's the worst thing
you ever done?

671
00:51:17,874 --> 00:51:19,248
No way.
lt's still your turn.

672
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:22,671
l mean, you gotta have done
somethin' worse than steal money.

673
00:51:22,849 --> 00:51:24,601
Okay, okay.

674
00:51:27,184 --> 00:51:28,313
How about this?

675
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:31,024
Back in college...

676
00:51:32,507 --> 00:51:34,669
l slept
with my best friend's boyfriend.

677
00:51:34,836 --> 00:51:36,977
[ Sniffs ]
Oh, now that's bad.

678
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:41,321
You must've broke some hearts
that day, ain't it?

679
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:43,832
At least three.

680
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:47,936
Yeah, just like me.
l broke three hearts too.

681
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:56,144
[ Suzy ] Your dad was
a good-looking guy, you know?

682
00:51:57,747 --> 00:52:00,671
He was givin' me the eye.
Just a little bit, you know?

683
00:52:03,587 --> 00:52:07,045
My dad, did he ever
talk about me?

684
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:15,496
He was always
talking about...

685
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:18,102
you two playin' basketball.
[ Chuckles ]

686
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:23,636
[ Arnold ]
l remember this time...
me and my boy Victor...

687
00:52:24,608 --> 00:52:27,941
we were playin' two-on-two basketball
against these Jesuits.

688
00:52:29,546 --> 00:52:32,014
These Jesuits had on their white collars
and their black robes...

689
00:52:32,115 --> 00:52:34,015
and they were
pretty damn good.

690
00:52:34,313 --> 00:52:36,017
By the way they were playing...

691
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:39,418
l could've swore they had seven out
of twelve apostles on their side.

692
00:52:39,986 --> 00:52:42,274
Because every time
l tried to shoot the ball...

693
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:45,655
there was a storm of locusts
come flyin' in and blind me.

694
00:52:45,866 --> 00:52:49,630
Now, l was shootin' in the dark.
ln the dark, l tell ya.

695
00:52:49,733 --> 00:52:51,633
But my boy Victor--

696
00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:56,897
He was magic.
He couldn't miss.

697
00:52:57,138 --> 00:53:00,801
Those Jesuits didn't have a prayer
of stoppin' him fair and square.

698
00:53:01,122 --> 00:53:01,976
All right!
Ha-ha-ha!

699
00:53:02,078 --> 00:53:05,639
Victor was only 12 years old
and kind of small...

700
00:53:05,749 --> 00:53:08,411
so those Jesuits
were beatin' up on him real good.

701
00:53:08,749 --> 00:53:11,183
They were beatin' up on him
and chantin' at him...

702
00:53:11,183 --> 00:53:13,271
like he was possessed
or somethin'.

703
00:53:14,891 --> 00:53:17,724
Maybe Victor was possessed
by the spirit of Jim Thorpe...

704
00:53:17,827 --> 00:53:21,923
because he had this look
in his eye, and he was mean.

705
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:23,956
"Come on, Victor!"
l shouted.

706
00:53:24,157 --> 00:53:25,180
"Come on, Victor!

707
00:53:26,803 --> 00:53:29,139
We're up against the Son
and the Father here!

708
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:33,779
And these two are gonna need
the Holy Ghost to beat us!"

709
00:53:34,802 --> 00:53:37,311
l mean, the score
was all tied up.

710
00:53:37,786 --> 00:53:39,814
Next basket wins, you know?

711
00:53:40,265 --> 00:53:41,966
So the Jesuits
had the ball.

712
00:53:42,085 --> 00:53:44,315
And this great, big
redhead Jesuit...

713
00:53:44,421 --> 00:53:47,185
come drivin' in
and knocked my boy over.

714
00:53:47,382 --> 00:53:50,672
My boy, he was tough.

715
00:53:51,192 --> 00:53:53,488
You gotta have faith, son.

716
00:53:53,488 --> 00:53:56,063
Faith. Next basket wins.

717
00:53:56,633 --> 00:53:59,895
And he took it to the hoop,
and he flew, man!

718
00:53:59,930 --> 00:54:02,023
He flew,
right over that Jesuit!

719
00:54:02,158 --> 00:54:05,670
Twelve years old, and he was like some
kind of indigenous angel or somethin'.

720
00:54:06,165 --> 00:54:09,021
'Cept maybe his wings
were made out of TV dinner trays!

721
00:54:11,448 --> 00:54:14,849
My boy Victor!
He was the man that day.

722
00:54:14,951 --> 00:54:17,973
He took that shot,
and he won that game.

723
00:54:18,788 --> 00:54:21,382
lt was the lndians
versus the Christians that day...

724
00:54:21,491 --> 00:54:24,286
and for at least one day,
the lndians won!

725
00:54:34,804 --> 00:54:36,851
- So he told you l made the shot, huh?


726
00:54:37,942 --> 00:54:38,801
- Yeah.

727
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:42,085
Yeah, well, l missed the shot.
l lost the game.

728
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:44,838
You mean,
your dad lied to me?

729
00:54:45,089 --> 00:54:47,944
Yeah, in a lie
that made me look good.

730
00:54:50,487 --> 00:54:52,329
He was a magician,
you know.

731
00:54:53,089 --> 00:54:54,989
l know.

732
00:54:59,596 --> 00:55:02,087
- Did you love him?
- What?

733
00:55:03,566 --> 00:55:05,659
Did you love him?

734
00:55:05,769 --> 00:55:07,794
Yes.

735
00:55:07,904 --> 00:55:09,838
He was like--

736
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:13,500
like a father, l guess.

737
00:55:15,512 --> 00:55:17,412
A father.

738
00:55:17,514 --> 00:55:20,005
He had you fooled too,
then, ain't it?

739
00:55:20,116 --> 00:55:22,846
He quit drinkin'
you know.

740
00:55:22,952 --> 00:55:24,852
Yeah.

741
00:55:24,954 --> 00:55:27,718
He was pretty tricky,
wasn't he?

742
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:36,330
Hey, Victor,
you ever hear of...

743
00:55:36,433 --> 00:55:39,527
the Gathering of Nations Powwow
in New Mexico?

744
00:55:39,636 --> 00:55:42,230
No? Well, your dad and l...

745
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:44,569
we went to check it out
last year.

746
00:55:45,942 --> 00:55:48,502
All sorts of lndians there,
thousands of 'em...

747
00:55:48,611 --> 00:55:50,841
more lndians than l've
ever seen in one place.

748
00:55:50,947 --> 00:55:54,906
l kept thinkin' "l wish we'd been
this organized when Columbus landed."

749
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:58,385
Your dad and l were sittin'
way up high in the stands.

750
00:55:58,488 --> 00:56:02,049
He never liked to get too close
to anything, you know?

751
00:56:02,158 --> 00:56:05,753
And then, the powwow emcee, he
called for a ladies' choice dance.

752
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:09,229
l got to pick my partner,
and l picked your dad.

753
00:56:09,332 --> 00:56:12,301
There were mothers
and fathers dancing...

754
00:56:12,402 --> 00:56:14,336
and brothers
and sisters...

755
00:56:14,437 --> 00:56:18,430
there were some sweethearts,
then there was your dad and me.

756
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:20,941
And what were you two?

757
00:56:24,247 --> 00:56:27,011
We kept each other's secrets.

758
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:33,754
- Kafka.
- What?

759
00:56:34,991 --> 00:56:37,824
lt's Kafka,
Arnold's dog.

760
00:56:39,295 --> 00:56:43,322
He's been-- Well, he's been gone
since l found your dad.

761
00:56:45,602 --> 00:56:47,502
Kafka!

762
00:56:47,604 --> 00:56:50,129
Where's your master, huh?

763
00:57:36,419 --> 00:57:38,819
You wouldn't believe the smell.

764
00:57:43,193 --> 00:57:46,822
You know, Victor,
his stuff's still in there.

765
00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:49,160
Might be something
you wanna keep.

766
00:57:49,265 --> 00:57:52,029
There's nothing
in there for me.

767
00:57:57,407 --> 00:57:59,602
Victor, please?

768
00:57:59,709 --> 00:58:02,269
No way.

769
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:08,250
How about this?

770
00:58:08,351 --> 00:58:11,514
lf l make a shot,
then you have to go inside.

771
00:58:11,621 --> 00:58:14,089
- Deal?
- And if you miss?

772
00:58:14,190 --> 00:58:16,090
Then l'll leave you alone.

773
00:58:16,192 --> 00:58:18,092
Fine. lt's a deal.

774
00:58:25,768 --> 00:58:27,668
Nice shot.

775
00:58:33,042 --> 00:58:35,374
But l still ain't goin' in.

776
00:58:37,213 --> 00:58:42,378
Look, Victor, l'm not playin' some kind
of game here. l'm tryin' to help.

777
00:58:42,485 --> 00:58:46,819
Tryin' to help what?
l mean, who the hell are you anyways?

778
00:58:46,923 --> 00:58:49,585
You're tellin' me
all these stories about my father...

779
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:51,887
and l don't even know
if they're true.

780
00:58:51,995 --> 00:58:54,156
Hey, maybe you
don't even know him.

781
00:58:54,264 --> 00:58:56,164
l know more about him
than you do.

782
00:58:56,266 --> 00:58:58,166
You don't know anything!

783
00:59:02,672 --> 00:59:04,572
l know about
the Fourth of July party.

784
00:59:04,674 --> 00:59:08,405
- The one where the house burned down.
- What about it?

785
00:59:08,511 --> 00:59:12,242
- l know how it started.
- Nobody knows how it started.

786
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:26,026
Come on!
Get up, you guys.

787
00:59:37,373 --> 00:59:40,865
Come on, you guys!
You gonna get up or what?

788
00:59:40,977 --> 00:59:42,877
Come on!

789
00:59:48,318 --> 00:59:51,810
Wally, come on!

790
00:59:54,057 --> 00:59:56,218
My dad started that fire?

791
00:59:56,326 --> 01:00:00,160
- lt was an accident.
- He killed Thomas's mom and dad?

792
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:02,060
But he saved Thomas.

793
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:10,436
- He almost killed all of us?
- He saved you.

794
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:13,008
No, my mom saved me.

795
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:17,409
Listen to me, Victor. Your dad
talked about that fire every day.

796
01:00:17,513 --> 01:00:21,142
He cried about it.
He wished he could've changed it.

797
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:25,448
He wished he hadn't run away. But you
have to remember one thing, Victor.

798
01:00:25,555 --> 01:00:28,991
He ran back into that burning house
looking for you.

799
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:33,352
He went back for you.

800
01:00:35,398 --> 01:00:37,457
He didn't mean
to die here, Victor.

801
01:00:39,435 --> 01:00:41,335
He wanted to go home.

802
01:00:41,437 --> 01:00:43,837
He always wanted
to go home.

803
01:00:48,378 --> 01:00:50,278
He's waiting for you, Victor.

804
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:55,049
He's waiting for you.

805
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:08,974
[ Thomas Narrating ]
After Victor butchered his hair...

806
01:03:09,318 --> 01:03:11,752
he thought
the ceremony was over...

807
01:03:11,854 --> 01:03:14,516
so he tore me from sleep
at sunrise...

808
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:18,390
and we left Phoenix
without tellin' Suzy good-bye.

809
01:03:18,494 --> 01:03:20,758
l thought we were leavin'
in a bad way...

810
01:03:20,863 --> 01:03:23,764
but Victor
didn't seem to care a bit.

811
01:03:23,866 --> 01:03:27,233
He just drove all day
and didn't say a word to me...

812
01:03:27,336 --> 01:03:29,736
even though l told him
a thousand stories...

813
01:03:29,839 --> 01:03:32,171
about Suzy and drought...

814
01:03:32,275 --> 01:03:34,743
about his mother and hunger...

815
01:03:34,744 --> 01:03:35,744
about his father and magic.

816
01:03:37,914 --> 01:03:39,814
And then l told Victor...

817
01:03:39,916 --> 01:03:43,682
l thought we were all travelin'
heavy with illusions.

818
01:03:43,786 --> 01:03:47,347
[ Thomas ]
l remember so much about your dad.

819
01:03:48,891 --> 01:03:52,691
l remember when he took me
for breakfast at Denny's .

820
01:03:52,795 --> 01:03:56,094
Your dad was goin'
on and on about you.

821
01:03:56,199 --> 01:03:59,293
He said you were so good
at basketball.

822
01:03:59,402 --> 01:04:04,362
But he also said basketball was the only
thing you were ever gonna be good at.

823
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:10,074
You know, Thomas, l'm really sick
and tired of you tellin' me...

824
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:13,171
all these stories about my dad
like you knew him.

825
01:04:13,282 --> 01:04:15,341
But l did know him.

826
01:04:15,451 --> 01:04:17,351
What do you know
about him, Thomas?

827
01:04:17,453 --> 01:04:20,479
Did you know he's a drunk?
Did you know that he left my family?

828
01:04:20,590 --> 01:04:24,082
Did you know he beat up my mom?
Did you know he beat me up?

829
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:26,684
Just let it go, Thomas!
He was nothing but a liar.

830
01:04:26,796 --> 01:04:31,927
- No, your dad was more than that.
- What was he then, Thomas?

831
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:35,936
You tell me. You're the expert.
What do you think he was?

832
01:04:36,038 --> 01:04:39,439
You know,
you got it all wrong, Victor.

833
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:41,442
Maybe you don't know
who you are!

834
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:45,344
- l don't know what the hell
you're talkin' about.
- l think you do.

835
01:04:45,448 --> 01:04:48,076
You've been mopin' around
the reservation for ten years.

836
01:04:48,184 --> 01:04:52,018
Ten years, Victor!
Doin' what?

837
01:04:52,121 --> 01:04:55,557
You ain't got no job! You ain't got
no money! You ain't got nothin'!

838
01:04:55,658 --> 01:04:57,888
Yeah, and what do you got, huh, Thomas?
What do you do all day long?

839
01:04:57,994 --> 01:05:00,895
- l look after my grandma.
- Yeah, and l look after my mom.

840
01:05:00,997 --> 01:05:03,864
- You make your mom cry.
- Shut up, Thomas!

841
01:05:03,966 --> 01:05:07,527
You make your mom
cry her eyes out!

842
01:05:07,637 --> 01:05:11,869
l mean, your dad left her, sure,
but you left her too.

843
01:05:11,974 --> 01:05:14,943
And you're worse 'cause you still live
in the same house with her!

844
01:05:15,044 --> 01:05:17,239
Shut up, Thomas!
Just shut up!

845
01:05:17,346 --> 01:05:19,871
He saved your dumb ass in that fire!
He didn't save me!

846
01:05:19,982 --> 01:05:22,610
- He never saved me!
- Quit feelin' sorry for yourself.

847
01:05:22,718 --> 01:05:25,278
l wish he would have let you burn
in that fire, you know?

848
01:05:25,388 --> 01:05:27,822
Then he wouldn't have left me.

849
01:05:27,924 --> 01:05:30,722
He was always leavin' Victor!

850
01:05:30,826 --> 01:05:34,387
Everything burned up, Thomas,
everything! Everything burned up!

851
01:05:34,497 --> 01:05:37,796
Everything! Everything! Shit!

852
01:05:53,449 --> 01:05:58,443
What have you done?
What have you done? What did you do?

853
01:05:58,554 --> 01:06:02,752
- Burt!
- [ Man ] Get in the car, Penny!

854
01:06:02,858 --> 01:06:06,419
l'm so-- l'm so sorry. He was drunk,
and he was driving so fast.

855
01:06:06,529 --> 01:06:08,929
- l told him to slow down. l'm so sorry.
- All right, get back in the car.

856
01:06:09,031 --> 01:06:12,125
- Get in the car! Stay in the car!
- Hey, take it easy!

857
01:06:12,234 --> 01:06:13,826
- Get your hands off me!
- l didn't do anything.

858
01:06:13,936 --> 01:06:17,337
lt's your fault, man.
You hit my car, man.

859
01:06:19,241 --> 01:06:21,607
- You're drunk!
- Take it easy! Get out of my face!

860
01:06:21,711 --> 01:06:24,680
- Step away!
- lt's your fault!

861
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:29,979
Help me! Hurry!
Somebody, help!

862
01:06:30,086 --> 01:06:32,486
- lt's your fault. You hit me!
- l didn't do anything.

863
01:06:32,588 --> 01:06:35,716
- Oh, no, help me!
- Don't let her up!

864
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:38,453
- You're drunk!
- Get out of my face!

865
01:06:38,561 --> 01:06:41,357
- Get your hands off me!
- Look at what you did to your wife!

866
01:06:41,358 --> 01:06:42,658
Look what you did!

867
01:06:42,765 --> 01:06:44,995
- What's your name?
- Holly.

868
01:06:45,101 --> 01:06:47,365
This is your fault.

869
01:06:47,470 --> 01:06:50,234
This is your fault.

870
01:06:50,339 --> 01:06:53,740
- l'll go for help.
- What, are you crazy?

871
01:06:53,843 --> 01:06:56,903
The nearest town is 20 miles away.
You'll never make it.

872
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:59,208
l'm goin' for help.
Thomas!

873
01:06:59,315 --> 01:07:02,182
[ Burt ]
And she ain't gonna make it either!

874
01:07:02,284 --> 01:07:04,878
l'm goin' for help!

875
01:07:08,758 --> 01:07:12,319
That's a dead girl
you're talkin' to.

876
01:07:12,428 --> 01:07:14,328
lt's a dead girl!

877
01:07:39,288 --> 01:07:42,086
[ Suzy ] Your dad
talked about that fire every day.

878
01:07:42,191 --> 01:07:44,955
He cried about it.

879
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:48,394
He wished he could've changed it.
He wished he hadn't run away.

880
01:07:50,266 --> 01:07:52,860
But you have to remember
one thing, Victor.

881
01:07:52,968 --> 01:07:57,132
He ran back into that burning house
looking for you!

882
01:07:57,239 --> 01:07:59,230
He did one good thing.

883
01:07:59,341 --> 01:08:01,707
He went back for you.

884
01:08:03,512 --> 01:08:06,174
[ Arnold ] Everything in the world
can fit inside this ball.

885
01:08:07,983 --> 01:08:10,679
lt's not about magic, man.

886
01:08:10,786 --> 01:08:12,686
lt's about faith.

887
01:09:01,637 --> 01:09:04,572
Geez, Thomas,
can't you drive this thing?

888
01:09:04,673 --> 01:09:07,642
Geez, who are you to talk?
You're the one who got us in a wreck.

889
01:09:07,743 --> 01:09:11,577
Hey, a wreck's a wreck. l got cousins
who've been in a dozen car wrecks.

890
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:14,843
Old Lester Fallsapart has been
in a car wreck every year of his life.

891
01:09:14,950 --> 01:09:17,851
You and me,
we just had one car wreck.

892
01:09:17,953 --> 01:09:21,354
Victor, l think we were
in two wrecks last night.

893
01:09:38,774 --> 01:09:43,040
Well, if it isn't our marathon runner.
How ya doin'

894
01:09:43,145 --> 01:09:46,842
Oh, my feet hurt.
How's she?

895
01:09:46,949 --> 01:09:49,144
Julie's gonna be okay.

896
01:09:50,252 --> 01:09:52,186
You guys are heroes,
you know?

897
01:09:52,288 --> 01:09:54,722
lt's like you're
the Lone Ranger and Tonto.

898
01:09:54,823 --> 01:09:58,554
No, it's more like
we're Tonto and Tonto.

899
01:10:02,364 --> 01:10:05,595
l mean, the police were just here. That
Burt guy said the wreck was your fault.

900
01:10:05,701 --> 01:10:09,000
- No way.
- He said you were tryin' to kill him.

901
01:10:09,104 --> 01:10:11,231
- He's a goddamn liar.
- l know.

902
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:14,901
That's what l told the police.
l don't think they believed me.

903
01:10:15,010 --> 01:10:18,571
Well, geez, we probably should
get out of town then, ain't it, Victor?

904
01:10:18,681 --> 01:10:21,514
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

905
01:10:37,166 --> 01:10:40,658
Well, it looks like you boys got
yourself into some serious trouble here.

906
01:10:40,769 --> 01:10:43,636
You've been accused
of assault with a deadly weapon.

907
01:10:43,739 --> 01:10:45,570
That's bullshit.

908
01:10:45,674 --> 01:10:49,371
- lt's Victor, is it?
- Yes.

909
01:10:49,478 --> 01:10:51,207
Victor Joseph.

910
01:10:51,313 --> 01:10:55,374
Well, that kind of language
isn't necessary, Victor.

911
01:10:55,484 --> 01:10:57,281
We didn't do anything wrong.

912
01:10:57,386 --> 01:10:59,581
You didn't do anything wrong.

913
01:10:59,688 --> 01:11:02,782
Well, l have this complaint...

914
01:11:02,891 --> 01:11:06,918
signed by a Mr. Burt Cicero.

915
01:11:07,029 --> 01:11:09,554
And Mr. Cicero alleges...

916
01:11:09,665 --> 01:11:15,433
that Mr. Joseph assaulted him
soon after the accident...

917
01:11:15,537 --> 01:11:17,562
and that you were drunk.

918
01:11:17,673 --> 01:11:20,403
- ls that true?
- l don't drink.

919
01:11:20,509 --> 01:11:23,171
l never had a drop of alcohol
in my life, Officer.

920
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:25,975
Not one drop.

921
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:36,180
Well, just what kind of lnjun
are you, exactly?

922
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:40,695
l'm Coeur d'A lene, and Thomas
here is Coeur d'A lene too.

923
01:11:40,796 --> 01:11:43,287
Y-Yeah, exactly.

924
01:11:43,399 --> 01:11:47,426
Well, Mr. Builds-the-Fire...

925
01:11:49,438 --> 01:11:53,033
what do you think
about all these charges?

926
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:55,042
We was framed.

927
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:57,203
Framed? Well--

928
01:11:58,914 --> 01:12:04,614
We do have another statement here
by a Mrs. Penny Cicero.

929
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:07,985
lt says here
that her husband is--

930
01:12:08,090 --> 01:12:11,821
and l quote--
"a complete asshole."

931
01:12:13,729 --> 01:12:17,859
l'd say Mr. Cicero doesn't have
much of a case here against you.

932
01:12:17,966 --> 01:12:22,528
However, l do have
one problem here. Uh--

933
01:12:22,638 --> 01:12:26,233
Now, l know that this...

934
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:28,833
is a basketball.

935
01:12:28,944 --> 01:12:30,844
But l am very...

936
01:12:32,948 --> 01:12:37,248
very curious about this.

937
01:12:39,822 --> 01:12:41,722
That's my father.

938
01:12:45,694 --> 01:12:47,889
Your father?

939
01:12:47,996 --> 01:12:51,397
Yes. That's my father.

940
01:13:06,248 --> 01:13:10,116
l can't believe we got out
of that guy's office alive.

941
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:14,121
Yeah, l guess your warrior
look does work sometimes.

942
01:13:30,739 --> 01:13:33,264
Let me hold on to Dad.

943
01:13:46,755 --> 01:13:49,485
Thomas...

944
01:13:49,591 --> 01:13:52,651
l'm sorry l got us
into that wreck.

945
01:13:52,761 --> 01:13:57,824
l mean, l'm sorry
about every wreck.

946
01:14:01,904 --> 01:14:04,099
Let's go.

947
01:16:16,638 --> 01:16:18,765
l bet your grandma
really missed you, huh?

948
01:16:18,874 --> 01:16:24,744
Yeah, we've been gone 6 days,
12 hours and 32 minutes.

949
01:16:26,081 --> 01:16:28,982
You know, Thomas, l, uh--

950
01:16:30,319 --> 01:16:32,879
l wanna thank you
for everything.

951
01:16:32,988 --> 01:16:35,388
For the money and stuff.

952
01:16:35,490 --> 01:16:38,254
l-lt's nothin' really.

953
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:41,591
- l mean, l just wanted to--
- l-lt's nothin'.

954
01:16:41,697 --> 01:16:46,100
l mean, who needs money
on the res anyways?

955
01:16:46,201 --> 01:16:48,601
Yeah, you're probably right.

956
01:17:21,203 --> 01:17:23,103
Are you sure?

957
01:17:23,205 --> 01:17:26,106
Yeah, l'm sure.

958
01:17:28,477 --> 01:17:32,811
Victor, l'm gonna travel
to Spokane for one last time...

959
01:17:32,914 --> 01:17:35,144
and toss these ashes
into the river...

960
01:17:35,250 --> 01:17:37,514
and your father
will rise like a salmon.

961
01:17:37,619 --> 01:17:39,519
He'll rise.

962
01:17:41,990 --> 01:17:45,323
What? What?

963
01:17:45,427 --> 01:17:49,227
Well, l was thinkin'
about doin' the same thing myself...

964
01:17:49,331 --> 01:17:52,732
but l never thought of my father
as a salmon.

965
01:17:52,834 --> 01:17:56,998
l mean, l thought it would be just like
cleaning out the attic, you know?

966
01:17:57,105 --> 01:18:02,008
Like throwin' things away
when they have no more use.

967
01:18:13,355 --> 01:18:16,085
Thanks, eh?

968
01:18:36,812 --> 01:18:38,712
Hey, Victor!

969
01:18:43,218 --> 01:18:45,550
- What is it, Thomas?
- Hey, Victor.

970
01:18:45,654 --> 01:18:48,714
Do you know
why your dad really left?

971
01:18:51,493 --> 01:18:53,393
Yeah.

972
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,400
He didn't mean to, Thomas.

973
01:20:55,116 --> 01:20:57,983
Tell me what happened, Thomas.

974
01:20:59,988 --> 01:21:02,889
Tell me what's going
to happen.

975
01:21:11,266 --> 01:21:14,064
[ Thomas Narrating ]
How do we forgive our fathers?

976
01:21:14,169 --> 01:21:16,069
Maybe in a dream.

977
01:21:17,505 --> 01:21:20,736
Do we forgive our fathers
for leavin' us too often...

978
01:21:20,842 --> 01:21:23,572
or forever
when we were little?

979
01:21:23,678 --> 01:21:27,580
Maybe for scarin' us
with unexpected rage?

980
01:21:27,682 --> 01:21:33,552
Or makin' us nervous because there never
seemed to be any rage there at all?

981
01:21:33,655 --> 01:21:36,249
Do we forgive our fathers
for marryin'. ..

982
01:21:36,358 --> 01:21:39,191
or not marryin' our mothers?

983
01:21:39,294 --> 01:21:44,095
For divorcin'
or not divorcin' our mothers?

984
01:21:44,199 --> 01:21:47,635
And shall we forgive them
for their excesses of warmth...

985
01:21:47,736 --> 01:21:50,261
or coldness?

986
01:21:50,372 --> 01:21:54,468
Shall we forgive them
for pushin' or leanin'

987
01:21:54,576 --> 01:21:56,567
For shuttin' doors?

988
01:21:56,678 --> 01:21:58,669
For speakin' through walls...

989
01:21:58,780 --> 01:22:01,010
or never speakin'

990
01:22:01,116 --> 01:22:03,516
Or never being silent?

991
01:22:45,260 --> 01:22:48,093
Do we forgive our fathers
in our age...

992
01:22:48,196 --> 01:22:50,528
or in theirs?

993
01:22:50,632 --> 01:22:54,591
Or in their deaths,
saying it to them?

994
01:22:54,703 --> 01:22:57,501
Or not saying it?

995
01:22:57,605 --> 01:23:00,233
lf we forgive our fathers...

996
01:23:00,342 --> 01:23:02,242
what is left?
