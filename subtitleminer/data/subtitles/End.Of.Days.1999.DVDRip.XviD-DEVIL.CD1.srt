1
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:44,340
Oculus Deum.

2
00:04:19,876 --> 00:04:22,140
She must be killed!

3
00:04:27,884 --> 00:04:30,114
She was chosen
to bear his child.

4
00:04:30,386 --> 00:04:33,947
If she lives to bring about the End
of Days, there will be no redemption.

5
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:35,790
All our souls
will perish.

6
00:04:59,415 --> 00:05:00,905
Tomaso.

7
00:05:27,443 --> 00:05:29,809
Okay, now give me
a big push.

8
00:05:29,844 --> 00:05:32,176
That's it.
You're doing great.

9
00:05:32,448 --> 00:05:35,417
That's it. Okay, stop pushing.
... fýve, six, seven...

10
00:05:35,451 --> 00:05:37,385
I have the baby's head.

11
00:05:37,453 --> 00:05:39,648
Don't push yet.

12
00:05:39,956 --> 00:05:43,551
One little push oughta fýnish
this off. One little push.

13
00:05:45,461 --> 00:05:48,089
You have
a beautiful baby girl.

14
00:05:48,464 --> 00:05:49,931
Oh!

15
00:05:49,966 --> 00:05:53,697
She's so beautiful!

16
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:56,905
She's so beautiful!

17
00:05:57,974 --> 00:05:59,925
Just gonna take her
and clean her up.

18
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,876
Not yet.
Hospital rules.

19
00:06:01,978 --> 00:06:04,003
Please. You'll have her
back before you know it.

20
00:07:55,091 --> 00:07:57,389
Here she is.

21
00:07:58,594 --> 00:08:03,064
All fresh and clean.

22
00:08:03,099 --> 00:08:06,728
You thought of a name
for her yet? Christine.

23
00:08:06,763 --> 00:08:09,162
Her name is Christine.

24
00:08:09,605 --> 00:08:12,904
Happy birthday,
Christine.

25
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:25,236
WBAZ time is 8:06.

26
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:29,173
Three more nights, New York. Three
more nights left in the century.

27
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:32,344
Three more nights left
in the millennium.

28
00:08:32,378 --> 00:08:35,074
Three more nights
until every computer fails.

29
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:39,750
Three more nights until the biggest
celebration in the history of this city...

30
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:41,820
starts in Times Square.

31
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:43,856
Where will you be?

32
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:48,952
Hey, Bobby, come over here.
Something weird's goin'on.

33
00:08:57,403 --> 00:08:59,564
What do you got there,
Charlie? I don't know.

34
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:02,773
Pressure's climbin'
off the gauge.

35
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,057
Go the other way!

36
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:44,400
Excuse me.

37
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:58,840
What the hell are you...

38
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,230
Mmm.

39
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:47,861
You're on Gotham Talk.
Say something interesting.

40
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:50,334
I'm trying to figure out
what everyone's predicting here.

41
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:53,827
Is the world going to come to an end
at exactly 12:01 on New Year's, or...

42
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,399
I'll tell you what.
You should play it safe,

43
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:58,810
not quit yourjob
just yet.

44
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:01,011
Tell you something else:
in two more nights,

45
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:03,144
this place is gonna see
the wildest party ever.

46
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:06,647
We're gonna be there with the first hundred
callers, we're gonna make the most noise,

47
00:13:06,682 --> 00:13:09,377
and we're gonna be the craziest,
and if the world comes to an end,

48
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:11,857
what the hell,
we're all gonna be together!

49
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:13,858
And if it doesn't,
and I don't think it will,

50
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:16,384
then we'll all have the best
time anybody has ever had.

51
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:45,686
Let's go.
We're gonna be late.

52
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:50,418
Honey, I'm home.

53
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:57,401
I was just
pulling myself together.

54
00:13:57,436 --> 00:14:00,166
It's gonna take
a lot more pulling.

55
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:04,376
You are looking
very sharp this morning.

56
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:06,968
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

57
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:10,174
You got about fýve minutes
to get ready. Here.

58
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:12,508
There's enough caffeine in this
to kill an elephant.

59
00:14:12,543 --> 00:14:15,785
Oughta get you
started.

60
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:19,981
- So what's today?
- Transport.

61
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:24,691
Anyone special?

62
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:32,002
No, just some
Wall Street scumbag.

63
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:35,370
Why the hell does he need
all this protection?

64
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:37,465
Well, I guess he fucked
with some people...

65
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:40,409
that didn't like
being fucked with.

66
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:45,246
Personally, I like scumbags.
They pay better.

67
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:10,405
They say breakfast is the
most important meal of the day.

68
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:16,572
No, I'm good.
Thanks.

69
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,709
Striker One, F.D.R. Drive...

70
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:21,986
Follow Three,
F.D.R. southbound.

71
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:24,751
Striker One, stay close.

72
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:26,992
Striker Four...
Okay, you zeroes.

73
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:29,256
These people are
paying us good money.

74
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:32,827
Get your heads out of your asses
and start earning those paychecks.

75
00:15:32,862 --> 00:15:34,556
Follow Three,
give me a visual sweep.

76
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,592
Striker One,
rooftops 125 to 136 clear.

77
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:43,006
- Keep them clear.
- Striker Four, advise and contact the...

78
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:46,977
Follow Three is on approach.
E. T.A., two minutes.

79
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:50,971
Striker One, Follow Two and Three to
report tight formation. Do you copy?

80
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:58,888
Air One, make a final sweep.
- Roger that.

81
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:02,526
Follow Three.
We have nest in sight.

82
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:04,859
Air One, westbound
over zone two.

83
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:20,568
Ten seconds out.

84
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:23,343
Roger. Ten seconds.

85
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:25,914
Follow Three,
we have arrived.

86
00:16:25,949 --> 00:16:27,815
Keep everyone close.

87
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:36,026
- We're exposed.
- Roger.

88
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:47,800
Sky Two,
fire escape, southwest corner.

89
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:51,807
Fire escape's negative.

90
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,790
You're wrong! Shooter!
Evac! Evac!

91
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:12,490
Get in the car!

92
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:39,957
Call N.Y.P.D.!
Get me an ambulance!

93
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:43,189
- What the hell's goin' on?
- I see him! I see him!

94
00:17:43,224 --> 00:17:45,394
Shit!

95
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:50,697
Oh, shit! Tell me
you remembered! Come on!

96
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,566
Get up,
you pussy.

97
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:03,480
Where's the shooter?

98
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:05,540
- Headed for the roof.
- So are we.

99
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:12,615
Sky Two, get the fuck
down here, now!

100
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:16,657
Come on! Hurry!

101
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:37,845
Take us up there!

102
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:54,658
Move in! Move in!

103
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:31,158
- Set us down! Hurry!
- There's too much crap on that roof!

104
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:34,572
- We'll tear off the main rotor.
- Then get us down as low as you can!

105
00:19:34,606 --> 00:19:37,507
Hurry now! Go!

106
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:39,338
Strap me in!

107
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:45,640
You're good!

108
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:19,516
- He's gonna jump
off the roof! Shit!

109
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,280
- He's gonna jump
off the roof! Shit!

110
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:32,221
He's got him!

111
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:48,043
Gun! Gun!

112
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:17,326
Oculus Dei!
The thousand years has ended!

113
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:20,203
The Dark Angel is loosed
from his prison!

114
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:23,332
Get down on the ground and
put your hands behind your head.

115
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:26,744
You don't know
what you've done!

116
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:30,111
- Get down, or I'll put you down!
- The thousand years has ended!

117
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:32,614
You don't know
what you've done!

118
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:17,794
Priest that drinks.
Can't be all bad.

119
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:20,297
I think the police
may want that at some point.

120
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:22,800
- They call it evidence.
- I like to get a head start.

121
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:25,437
- No reason to make it easy for them.
- Yeah.

122
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:27,930
All right.

123
00:23:30,358 --> 00:23:33,657
Watch the lines.
Go through here.

124
00:23:37,866 --> 00:23:40,232
She doesn't look happy
with the statements.

125
00:23:40,368 --> 00:23:43,963
Should've just killed that son
of a bitch. Less paperwork. Yeah.

126
00:23:43,998 --> 00:23:46,636
Hey, Detective. Bobby.
Hey, Jer, it's been a while.

127
00:23:46,875 --> 00:23:50,743
Hey. How are you, Marge?
Can't complain. You?

128
00:23:50,879 --> 00:23:53,245
It's a nice day to jump
out of a helicopter.

129
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,076
Well, just doing
my job.

130
00:23:55,383 --> 00:23:57,374
Now, listen. Something I gotta ask you.

131
00:23:57,385 --> 00:24:00,354
Yeah, what is it?
You still drinking?

132
00:24:00,388 --> 00:24:02,583
Oh, yeah, we got all
liquored up this morning.

133
00:24:02,891 --> 00:24:05,792
- We start every day that way.
- I'm just reading his statement.

134
00:24:05,894 --> 00:24:09,421
You said here the guy
spoke to you. Yeah. So what?

135
00:24:09,456 --> 00:24:12,161
The guy doesn't
have a tongue.

136
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:15,335
- What?
- He has no tongue?

137
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:19,067
Why don't I just leave
that little detail out for now.

138
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:22,468
No big deal, right? Are you
saying that I imagined all this?

139
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:24,845
No, I'm just saying.
I saved a life today.

140
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,814
What the hell did you
do? All right, let it go.

141
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:29,180
- No, no. I know what I heard.
- All right.

142
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:32,182
Those people who don't belong
here, get them out of here.

143
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:34,355
Make sure this place
is secure.

144
00:24:50,972 --> 00:24:54,931
A drunk hangs out in a neighborhood
bar, passes out enough times,

145
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:58,345
people would know where he
lived from carrying him home.

146
00:24:58,413 --> 00:25:00,347
I mean,
it's one thing I know.

147
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:02,747
Yeah, well, it's important
to be an expert at something.

148
00:25:02,782 --> 00:25:05,716
Oh, it took years of
research. This must be it.

149
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:19,628
What do you want to bet
it's rent-controlled?

150
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:50,124
Well, I don't think
this is paint.

151
00:25:52,867 --> 00:25:55,233
A real art buff.

152
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:59,137
I don't go for this look.
It's just too damn busy.

153
00:26:10,418 --> 00:26:13,080
Listen to this.

154
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:15,888
"I have seen the Earth
laid to waste.

155
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:21,224
"I have seen the horror to come. Is
it a sin to wish you were never born?

156
00:26:21,259 --> 00:26:23,794
"The thousand years
have ended.

157
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:27,467
Twenty... seven. "

158
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:30,630
It ends in a football
score. That's nice.

159
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,410
Hey, I found something.

160
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:41,107
Can you see
what it is?

161
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:48,683
His tongue.

162
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:53,026
He must have
cut it out himself.

163
00:26:53,061 --> 00:26:58,294
Okay. And why is it someone
would cut out their own tongue?

164
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:01,764
To keep from talking. Right.

165
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:08,509
Well, I could eat.

166
00:27:09,077 --> 00:27:10,677
Ah!

167
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:13,374
- Shit!
- What?

168
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,484
All right, I knew
that was gonna happen.

169
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:20,043
No, it's all right.

170
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:22,379
There's something
in here.

171
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:31,259
Have you ever seen her before? Nah.

172
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:05,327
This guy
is no ordinary hit man.

173
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,467
No, this one's
extraordinary.

174
00:28:07,502 --> 00:28:10,369
Let's get the hell outta here.
This place is making me itch.

175
00:28:10,672 --> 00:28:14,836
- Drop it! Don't move! Don't move! Freeze!
- Don't move! Freeze!

176
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:18,238
Oh. It's us.

177
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:22,640
Jesus! How the hell
did you two find this place?

178
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:26,086
Lucky guess. So what did you fýnd out?

179
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:28,588
His name's Thomas
Aquinas. He's a priest.

180
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:30,648
Why don't you tell us
something we don't know?

181
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:34,584
- A homicidal priest. That's good.
- Yeah? Well, it gets better.

182
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:37,826
He studied at the Vatican. He was
one of their alleged visionaries.

183
00:28:37,861 --> 00:28:40,465
Came here in '81 to St.
John's Church downtown.

184
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:43,399
Six months ago,
he disappeared.

185
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:46,106
Priests there say he was
having a spiritual crisis.

186
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,541
Oh, yeah.
That's what this is about.

187
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:51,511
Spiritual crisis.
Doesn't make any sense.

188
00:28:51,546 --> 00:28:54,276
What's a priest doing shooting
at a Wall Street banker?

189
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:58,608
A Wall Street banker, by the
way, who suddenly disappeared.

190
00:28:58,653 --> 00:29:00,553
Maybe we should ask the girl.

191
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:02,953
What girl?

192
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:06,594
Uh, the guy.
The guy. Priest guy.

193
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:11,859
There's fýve million women
living in New York City.

194
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:14,335
How we gonna fýnd her
without a name?

195
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:01,781
Here.

196
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:10,357
Look, I already gave you some
money. Can you just move on, please?

197
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:14,020
He's comin' for you.
He's comin' for you, Christine.

198
00:30:14,055 --> 00:30:15,862
How do you know
my name?

199
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:19,697
He's gonna fuck you. He's gonna
fuck you, Christine. Can you see him?

200
00:30:20,001 --> 00:30:21,117
Can you see him?
- Who are you?

201
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:22,016
Can you see him?
- Who are you?

202
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:24,617
How do you know
my name?

203
00:30:29,894 --> 00:30:32,727
He's gonna fuck you, Christine.

204
00:30:46,911 --> 00:30:50,677
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

205
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:36,409
Ohh.

206
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:55,189
The thousand years
have ended.

207
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:58,624
Thousand years have ended.

208
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,527
"When the thousand years
are ended,

209
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:04,827
Satan shall be loosed
out of his prison. "

210
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:09,737
"Twenty... seven. "

211
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:23,683
Christine?

212
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:28,244
Christine? I'll be there in a sec!

213
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:45,705
Doctor's offýce.

214
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:47,741
Hello.
Is Dr. Abel in, please?

215
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:49,709
Who's calling, please?
It's Christine York.

216
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:53,246
Christine, listen to me.
We've been over this before.

217
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:57,911
It's a terrible thing to lose your
parents. I know it was a long time ago.

218
00:33:58,286 --> 00:34:01,754
The holidays always make something
like that feel much worse.

219
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:07,159
Understand, these dreams are your
creation. There's nothing real about them.

220
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:12,323
You control them.
They don't control you.

221
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:16,269
Take another Xanax
to relieve your anxiety.

222
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:20,740
You are fýne. Trust me.

223
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:26,337
Another vision?
Why didn't you tell me?

224
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:30,944
I didn't want you to worry. I'm your
stepmother. It's my job to worry.

225
00:34:30,979 --> 00:34:32,752
No big deal, really.

226
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:36,620
Just someone on the subway car
turned into porcelain and shattered.

227
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:40,351
What's wrong with me? Why do I
see things? Why am I so different?

228
00:34:40,386 --> 00:34:44,594
Oh, you don't know
how special you are.

229
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:47,801
You're better than everybody
else. Just remember that.

230
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:50,770
I don't want to be better or
worse. I want to be normal.

231
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:54,569
I want a normal life.
You have to have patience.

232
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:57,276
All good things will come
to you. You'll see.

233
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:08,821
Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry, we're closed.

234
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:12,155
I would like to talk to
you about Thomas Aquinas.

235
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,487
Father, please, I need you
downstairs. Just take these.

236
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:16,796
Father, please.
Go.

237
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:23,462
I've already told the police. Thomas
was a friend of mine and a colleague.

238
00:35:23,497 --> 00:35:26,306
He had nothing to do
with what happened today.

239
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:28,342
There was no one else
on that fýre escape.

240
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:32,335
You don't understand. I understand
getting shot at, and I don't like it.

241
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:35,213
He shot at you? No,
he shot at my client.

242
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:38,384
- I happened to get in the way.
- Who's your client?

243
00:35:38,419 --> 00:35:42,583
That's irrelevant right now. What I want to
know is why would a priest try to kill someone?

244
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:47,224
You've been drinking. I've got 14
years sober, and I can spot that.

245
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:51,331
Well, good for you. Your friend and
colleague, was he working for someone?

246
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:53,390
Yes, he was working for God.

247
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:56,131
So God ordered a hit
on an investment banker?

248
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:59,271
There's a lot that you don't know.
You think you've seen everything?

249
00:35:59,306 --> 00:36:01,135
You haven't. There are
things you never dreamed of.

250
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:05,368
There's another world out there.
Thomas saw it, and it destroyed him.

251
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:09,509
I've seen a lot too, but there's nothing
that would make me cut my tongue out.

252
00:36:09,544 --> 00:36:13,148
Yeah, well, wait a few days.
What happens in a few days?

253
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,889
Did Thomas tell you
about a girl?

254
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:21,418
- No.
- I see. Do you believe in God?

255
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:27,162
Maybe once,
but not anymore.

256
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:29,402
What happened?

257
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:31,928
We had a difference of opinion.

258
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:36,900
I thought that my wife and daughter
should live, and He felt otherwise.

259
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:41,313
I'm sorry to hear about the loss. Maybe
it's time for you to renew your faith.

260
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,917
This girl.

261
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:47,250
Is she in trouble?
Does she need help?

262
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:50,424
I have a lot of things to do
here. Excuse me. Excuse me.

263
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:53,359
I have more questions, if you don't
mind. I've got a question for you.

264
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:56,328
If you don't believe in God, how
can you understand his adversary?

265
00:36:56,464 --> 00:37:00,867
Now I have to believe in God
in order to solve a crime?

266
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:04,131
I'm sure that you
can fýnd your way out.

267
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:44,739
- How many have received the stigmata?
- She's the third this week.

268
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:53,817
- What is she saying?
- For your own good, get out and forget what you've seen!

269
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:58,253
Was Thomas part of this? There are forces
at work you couldn't possibly comprehend!

270
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:01,222
Now, please,
leave!

271
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:12,836
# God rest ye, merry gentlemen #

272
00:38:12,871 --> 00:38:16,101
# Let nothing
you dismay #

273
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:18,478
# Remember Christ... ##

274
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:09,259
No, it's just I hate the fact that
they put fýnals after the holiday.

275
00:39:09,294 --> 00:39:11,544
It ruins the whole meaning of vacation.

276
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:13,794
I wouldn't worry.
You always do fýne.

277
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:15,848
Besides, a bad grade
isn't the end of the world.

278
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:33,069
It's you.

279
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:35,334
I didn't...
Where is she?

280
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:38,666
The girl is safe.
And what of the world?

281
00:39:38,701 --> 00:39:41,339
Everything is
as planned.

282
00:39:41,612 --> 00:39:44,080
Our acts go unnoticed,
unquestioned.

283
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:46,583
- We're everywhere.
- Daddy, who is it?

284
00:39:54,658 --> 00:39:58,253
- Is this your daughter?
- Yes.
