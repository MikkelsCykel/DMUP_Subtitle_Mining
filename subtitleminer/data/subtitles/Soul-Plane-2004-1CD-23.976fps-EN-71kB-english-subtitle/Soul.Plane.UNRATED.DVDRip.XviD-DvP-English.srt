I'm sorry, sir.

Your dog is too big
to be on the plane.

15
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,591
You'll have to check him.

16
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:57,511
Wait. No. I usually
just put him in my bag.

17
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:58,720
He's not that big.

18
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:01,974
Those are the rules.
You'll have to check your dog.

Come on, Dre.

- Chicken or beef stroganoff?

I'm gonna have the chicken.
I like the way that smelled.

39

That was our last chicken.

40
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:09,708
I'm afraid
I just have stroganoff.

41
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,835
So why would you ask me
what I wanted?

What's in that?

43

Stroganoff.

44
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:29,311
That beef strogie.
That wasn't half bad.

It was good.

46

- I'm an entrepreneur.
- I see.

- No.
- Exactly.

that you're nothin' more

00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,079
- You're such a whore.
- What did you say?

160
00:11:44,163 --> 00:11:45,289
Did I stutter?

161
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:47,916
There you are.

162
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:55,841
Four tickets for flight 069
on NWA.

163
00:11:55,883 --> 00:11:58,886
What you're going to want to do
is go to Gate One--

164
00:11:58,969 --> 00:12:03,974
that's Terminal X--and we'll send
your luggage on down for you.

165
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:06,518
- Thank you for your help.
- You're quite welcome.

166
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,145
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

167
00:12:08,187 --> 00:12:09,563
Hey, sweetie.

168
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:11,940
Don't get it greasy.
It's very expensive.

169
00:12:12,024 --> 00:12:13,650
I know, I bought it.

170
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:17,237
Now, a gentleman always
carries a lady's bags.

171
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:20,240
- So why are you carrying hers?
- Be kind, son.

172
00:12:20,324 --> 00:12:23,493
If I play my cards right,
she'll be your future mother figure.

173
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:24,912
That's scary.

174
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:27,247
Ooh, hey, sweetie.
Wait a minute.

175
00:12:27,331 --> 00:12:29,958
Don't look back
and not say anything.

176
00:12:30,042 --> 00:12:31,668
Excuse me.
You got to move, lady.

177
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,712
Baby, come here.
Gimme a second.

178
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:35,964
Girl, you must not know
who I am.

179
00:12:36,048 --> 00:12:39,009
Nashawn Wade, baby.
I own NWA. The boss.

180
00:12:39,051 --> 00:12:41,094
Where the hell is Terminal X?

181
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:44,681
Relax, honey. Didn't we just have
a great vacation in Crackerland?

182
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:48,644
No, we didn't--
give me that stupid hat. Leave it!

183
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:51,688
You know what would've
been great? Going to Hawaii alone.

184
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:53,148
Listen, you know the deal.

185
00:12:53,232 --> 00:12:55,234
I only get to see my kids
every other weekend.

186
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:58,070
Billy, where's your sister?

187
00:12:59,071 --> 00:13:00,239
She's that way.

188
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:02,908
Great.

189
00:13:06,245 --> 00:13:09,039
Heather, you can't just
walk away from the family.

190
00:13:09,081 --> 00:13:11,792
If you want to go somewhere,
you gotta ask permission first.

191
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:14,378
Dad, I'm 18 years old.

192
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:15,838
Sorry.

193
00:13:15,921 --> 00:13:18,924
She's 17. You are 17.

194
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:23,262
Fine. For a couple more hours.
I am 17, and then I'll be 18.

195
00:13:23,387 --> 00:13:24,805
Then I can party and have sex.

196
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:26,849
- Sex?! No, no.
- Yeah, sex.

197
00:13:26,932 --> 00:13:29,643
Missionary, doggie-style,
rockin' the baby,

198
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:30,686
gettin' tea-bagged,

199
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:33,522
playin' the trombone
while I'm tossin' his salad,

200
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:36,567
hand jobs, ear jobs,
blow jobs.

201
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:39,903
Gettin' a pearl necklace,
ridin' the bologna pony...

202
00:13:39,945 --> 00:13:41,780
- sucking--
- That's enough!

203
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:43,699
- Did she say bologna?
- I don't know.

204
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:46,410
...whenever I want, and best of all,
I won't have to listen to you.

205
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:51,331
Can you believe that?

206
00:13:51,415 --> 00:13:55,127
What came after
getting tea-bagged?

207
00:13:55,252 --> 00:13:56,628
Something about the trombone.

208
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,674
Okay, everybody,
congratulations!

209
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:02,968
You guys have been punk'd!

210
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:05,304
There's cameras everywhere,
right, son?

211
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:08,056
We'll be back in five minutes
with the release forms.

212
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,641
Let's go.

213
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:18,984
Oh, shit! Awesome!

214
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:25,574
- Terminal Malcolm X?
- Yeah.

215
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:30,996
Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles.
Usually you gotta go to two places,

216
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:33,499
- but there you get the one--
- This is a terminal?

217
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:36,502
It's great, 99 cents. Everything.

218
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:39,796
Oh, check out the car.

219
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:44,301
This place has every--
there's a basketball court.

220
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:48,180
In your face!

221
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:52,059
Get your short ass on,
you leprechaun.

222
00:14:52,142 --> 00:14:53,810
Look like my ex--
short and stupid.

223
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:55,187
Everything's short.

224
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:56,772
I don't know about all that,

225
00:14:56,855 --> 00:15:00,484
but if Denzel walked his fine
sexy ass in here right now,

226
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:02,194
I'm takin' the rest of the day off

227
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:05,239
and gettin' straight down
with the get down.

228
00:15:05,322 --> 00:15:06,365
You know what I'm sayin'?

229
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:07,950
Girl, let me tell you,
Denzel is nice,

230
00:15:08,033 --> 00:15:09,201
but I like the young thugs.

231
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:12,246
I love me some 50 Cent, baby.

232
00:15:12,371 --> 00:15:14,832
Ooh, Shaniece. Go, Shaniece!

233
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:16,708
It's your birthday.

234
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,710
We gonna party
like it's your birthday.

235
00:15:18,794 --> 00:15:20,712
Sip Bacardi
like it's my birthday.

236
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:23,048
And you know we don't
give a fuck it's not my birthday!

237
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:27,553
Look at this little nigga here.

238
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:29,388
Look more like five cent.

239
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,682
Nigga, can't you read?

240
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:34,601
The sign says put
all metal objects in the container.

241
00:15:34,685 --> 00:15:37,187
Take your ass off.
Get on back there!

242
00:15:37,312 --> 00:15:38,355
Get your ass back there.

243
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,148
Cheap ass.

244
00:15:40,232 --> 00:15:43,694
Shit goin' off 'cause that shit cheap.
That's why it's goin' off.

245
00:15:43,819 --> 00:15:46,029
My flow, my show
bought me the dough

246
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:48,323
that bought me
all my fancy things.

247
00:15:48,407 --> 00:15:50,492
My cribs, my cars,
my pools, my jewels.

248
00:15:50,576 --> 00:15:52,411
Nigga, I done came up
and I ain't changed.

249
00:15:55,664 --> 00:15:56,790
Hold it!

250
00:15:56,874 --> 00:15:59,042
You keep fuckin' up
on my rhymes.

251
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:01,420
Move it along, nickel.

252
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:05,465
You wanna say somethin'?!

253
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:07,593
I ain't slapped a bitch
in two weeks.

254
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:09,178
Yeah, I got a whole lot
of strength

255
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:10,762
in the slap-a-bitch arm.

256
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:17,936
They had a whole bunch of dirty
magazines--bathing suit issues.

257
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:21,190
Damn! So you like that, huh?
You gonna love this.

258
00:16:21,273 --> 00:16:24,568
Hold those for me, I won't be
needing those on this flight.

259
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:25,944
Girl, what you got me--

260
00:16:31,325 --> 00:16:33,660
The sweet smell of Alizé.

261
00:16:34,953 --> 00:16:38,665
- Hunkee? Elvis Hunkee?
- Yeah.

262
00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:41,960
Karl Malone? I used to play
basketball with you in high school.

263
00:16:42,044 --> 00:16:45,464
That's right. We used to call you
"The Paperboy."

264
00:16:45,506 --> 00:16:47,841
Yeah, that was then.
I'm "The Mailman" now.

265
00:16:47,925 --> 00:16:48,926
That's good.

266
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:52,012
My dad's a mailman, too.
Government jobs pay very well.

267
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:54,014
You don't understand,
I play for the Lakers now.

268
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:56,683
Right, Karl. I don't think
you understand.

269
00:16:56,767 --> 00:16:59,102
I used to play with you, man.
You can't shoot, remember?

270
00:16:59,144 --> 00:17:00,771
That's why we never
passed you the ball.

271
00:17:00,896 --> 00:17:02,898
I thought it was because
I was the only brother.

272
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,025
No, Karl. It's 'cause you sucked!

273
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:06,109
Oh, I sucked?

274
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:09,488
What are you gonna do--
go all "postal" on me, Mr. Mailman?

275
00:17:10,322 --> 00:17:12,324
My man, what's goin' on, baby?

276
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:15,077
Ah, that's nice.
That's real nice.

277
00:17:18,664 --> 00:17:21,625
I'd like to be them jeans.
Make no sense.

278
00:17:26,088 --> 00:17:27,422
Excuse me.
How you doin', man?

279
00:17:27,506 --> 00:17:29,424
Can I get through here,
sweetie?

280
00:17:29,508 --> 00:17:31,552
What's goin' on, fellas?
My man.

281
00:17:34,763 --> 00:17:36,473
When the buzzer pop, nigga,
you stop!

282
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,560
Do y'all know who I am?

283
00:17:40,686 --> 00:17:42,938
We don't give a damn
about who you are.

284
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:45,274
Let your little ass
take one more step...

285
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:48,819
...we'll bury your ass in them fake-ass
iguana shoes you're wearin'.

286
00:17:49,862 --> 00:17:53,657
Ladies, it's me. It's Nashawn Wade,
owner of this airline.

287
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:55,200
Come on, remember.
I hired y'all.

288
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:56,201
- It's him.
- There ya go.

289
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:58,954
That's a little more like it.
Thought you had amnesia.

290
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:01,039
Yes, it is him!

291
00:18:01,165 --> 00:18:03,709
You that little nigga got his ass
caught in a toilet seat.

292
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:14,595
All right, little player, go on, take
your little cute rich ass on through.

293
00:18:14,678 --> 00:18:16,013
Go ahead, little player.

294
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:17,848
Bet that ass still tight,
ain't it?

295
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,561
Shit, bitch. I hope we don't lose
our benefits over this.

296
00:18:22,644 --> 00:18:24,688
We sorry, Mr. Wade!

297
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:26,356
My tooth is hurtin'.

298
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:28,400
And it's fuckin'
with your breath, girl.

299
00:18:28,442 --> 00:18:30,110
Upsettin' all my insides here.

300
00:18:30,194 --> 00:18:31,862
Don't you say shit else
for a year.

301
00:18:31,904 --> 00:18:33,906
You done melted the whole side--

302
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:35,949
That's what you get
for fuckin' us up.

303
00:18:44,249 --> 00:18:47,127
I'll tell ya, I knew I shoulda got
the new Aerostar.

304
00:18:47,211 --> 00:18:49,046
Check out the safety rating.

305
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:51,089
I'm a little nervous.

306
00:18:51,173 --> 00:18:53,967
I heard someone say
this is the first flight for this airline.

307
00:18:54,051 --> 00:18:55,427
It has five cup holders.

308
00:18:55,511 --> 00:18:58,555
Honey, the FAA, they're very strict
about who they let fly an airline.

309
00:18:58,639 --> 00:18:59,932
It's gonna be okay, believe me.

310
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:03,268
Yeah, I know, but I think we're
the only white people on the plane.

311
00:19:03,352 --> 00:19:04,853
Girlfriend, like your bag.

312
00:19:04,937 --> 00:19:05,938
Honey, no, we're not.

313
00:19:07,022 --> 00:19:08,023
You ain't gonna pick me up?!

314
00:19:09,191 --> 00:19:12,611
Maybe it's a coincidence,
you know, like a family reunion?

315
00:19:12,653 --> 00:19:13,987
Million Man March?

316
00:19:32,047 --> 00:19:35,259
Hey, what are you...
Hey, stop that!

317
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:43,308
Yeah, what up, son?

318
00:19:43,392 --> 00:19:46,645
Yeah, yeah.
You know I'm like that.

319
00:19:46,687 --> 00:19:47,896
I'm like that.

320
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,189
Damn. What up?

321
00:19:49,273 --> 00:19:52,401
Here's your card, Dad.
I think I melted the sucka.

322
00:19:52,484 --> 00:19:54,111
Put everything on it
but an Escalade.

323
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:57,030
I'm a holler at the shorty
I saw at the basketball courts.

324
00:19:58,866 --> 00:20:00,492
One love, dawg.

325
00:20:01,577 --> 00:20:03,203
Where's my son?

326
00:20:07,499 --> 00:20:09,751
- How you doin'?
- I'm good.

327
00:20:09,835 --> 00:20:12,254
You doin' good?
You feel wonderful.

328
00:20:12,337 --> 00:20:16,300
- Yeah. All right.
- Hey. whoa! That's my zipper!

329
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:19,428
And that's too loud
for a zipper.

330
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:21,346
I don't know
what you got in there,

331
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:22,890
but we gonna find out.

332
00:20:22,973 --> 00:20:26,101
- I got a plane to catch.
- Come with me.

333
00:20:28,562 --> 00:20:31,315
Did you hear me, boy?!

334
00:20:31,982 --> 00:20:36,445
I bet you ain't never seen
a chocolate super-deluxe woman

335
00:20:36,528 --> 00:20:37,571
like me before.

336
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:39,823
Have you?

337
00:20:41,492 --> 00:20:45,537
No, I got a plane to catch.
I gotta go!

338
00:20:47,456 --> 00:20:50,292
Where do you think
you're goin', player?

339
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:51,502
I'm gonna get on--

340
00:20:51,543 --> 00:20:55,464
We feds now,
which means I can violate

341
00:20:55,547 --> 00:20:59,593
every last one
of your civil rights.

342
00:20:59,676 --> 00:21:02,679
Now drop them drawers...
Denzel.

343
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:06,141
Denzel? Look, lady.
I just want--

344
00:21:06,183 --> 00:21:08,060
Drop them drawers!

345
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:11,104
Show me that ass, nigga!

346
00:21:12,064 --> 00:21:13,732
Now turn around.

347
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:16,693
Cavity check!

348
00:21:29,915 --> 00:21:32,376
Girl, there was duct tape
and peanut butter everywhere.

349
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:35,796
I told him, I don't care
if you are a diplomat.

350
00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:37,506
I don't bend into that position.

351
00:21:37,589 --> 00:21:40,425
Girl, I ain't no circus freak.
This ain't Cirque du Soleil.

352
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:44,680
He's a fool.

353
00:21:44,763 --> 00:21:46,765
Mi vida,
you did the right thing.

354
00:21:46,807 --> 00:21:48,267
Mi primo tried that once.

355
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:51,144
The doctors still can't find
his left nut.

356
00:21:51,228 --> 00:21:52,896
They say it's up there
somewhere.

357
00:21:52,938 --> 00:21:55,732
Give me his address.
I'll find it.

358
00:21:57,276 --> 00:21:58,652
Hey, Muggsy!

359
00:21:58,735 --> 00:22:00,237
Flame, not now.

360
00:22:01,947 --> 00:22:03,782
Where's the pilots
you hired, man?

361
00:22:03,866 --> 00:22:05,826
- Come on, dawg--
- It's not come on now.

362
00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:08,203
We're supposed to take off
in 20 minutes.

363
00:22:08,287 --> 00:22:09,496
Calm down, Little Bow-Wow.

364
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,664
He'll be here, all right?

365
00:22:10,747 --> 00:22:13,375
- There he go right there.
- Who, him?

366
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:14,668
- Yeah, him.
- Right there?

367
00:22:14,751 --> 00:22:15,836
- Right there.
- Him?

368
00:22:19,548 --> 00:22:21,216
- Him right there?
- Yeah, him right there.

369
00:22:27,264 --> 00:22:28,807
I told you to hire
a black pilot,

370
00:22:28,891 --> 00:22:30,851
not no black baggage handler.
What is that?

371
00:22:30,934 --> 00:22:33,395
I did what
you asked me to, okay?

372
00:22:33,478 --> 00:22:35,230
There ain't but two
black pilots around,

373
00:22:35,314 --> 00:22:36,690
and one of 'em flyin' for Puffy.

374
00:22:36,773 --> 00:22:37,774
How'd Puffy get that one?

375
00:22:37,816 --> 00:22:40,569
- Don't worry.
- You're right, I'm just nervous.

376
00:22:40,652 --> 00:22:45,073
I got his resumé right there.
My dawg, what's up, baby?

377
00:22:45,157 --> 00:22:47,451
What's goin' on, Muggs?
How you been?

378
00:22:47,493 --> 00:22:48,577
What's up, man?

379
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,996
- How are you, man?
- Ain't nothin' to it but do it.

380
00:22:51,121 --> 00:22:53,290
Nashawn, Captain Mack.
Captain Mack, Nashawn.

381
00:22:53,373 --> 00:22:54,708
My pleasure, brother.

382
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:55,959
Hey. You're late, man.

383
00:22:56,043 --> 00:22:57,961
Don't worry about me bein' late.

384
00:22:58,003 --> 00:23:01,381
I'm gonna take this hooptie of yours
up another 1,000 feet,

385
00:23:01,507 --> 00:23:05,135
catch me a slipstream, and we
gonna be there five minutes early.

386
00:23:05,219 --> 00:23:08,180
Real slick like hair grease,
but with less mess.

387
00:23:08,263 --> 00:23:10,682
- Can you dig it?
- Hell, yeah, I can dig it.

388
00:23:10,724 --> 00:23:12,017
You really gonna do that?

389
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,019
No, I'm just fuckin' with ya.

390
00:23:15,771 --> 00:23:18,607
Y'all two know each other?
He was fuckin' with me.

391
00:23:19,608 --> 00:23:21,360
Muggs, I'm really
not playin' right now.

392
00:23:21,443 --> 00:23:22,945
I'm not, Muggs.

393
00:23:23,028 --> 00:23:24,571
I was lookin' at
your resumé, man.

394
00:23:24,696 --> 00:23:26,156
I see that you flew
in Desert Storm.

395
00:23:26,198 --> 00:23:28,534
- That's pretty impressive.
- Actually, that's a typo.

396
00:23:28,617 --> 00:23:29,785
I drew over in Desert Storm.

397
00:23:29,868 --> 00:23:31,703
I'm sorry. I didn't..
what you say?

398
00:23:31,787 --> 00:23:34,373
I was the nigga that drew
the little sayings on the bombs:

399
00:23:34,456 --> 00:23:37,292
"Fuck Iraq." "Saddam, eat a dick."
That was me.

400
00:23:37,376 --> 00:23:38,502
Secret agent.

401
00:23:38,585 --> 00:23:41,046
Matter of fact, I ain't even
'posed to be talkin' about that.

402
00:23:41,088 --> 00:23:42,130
That's classified.

403
00:23:42,214 --> 00:23:45,384
What the fuck?! Do you even
know how to fly a plane, man?

404
00:23:45,467 --> 00:23:47,094
I got my wings when I got out.

405
00:23:47,177 --> 00:23:48,679
Got your wings
when you got out?

406
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,975
You right. Plus I ain't really got
another choice right now.

407
00:23:54,142 --> 00:23:55,185
Where's your uniform?

408
00:23:55,269 --> 00:23:56,436
You lookin' at it.

409
00:23:56,562 --> 00:23:58,272
The Mackin' is crackin'.
This is how I come.

410
00:23:58,397 --> 00:23:59,731
I don't wear no square suits.

411
00:23:59,815 --> 00:24:01,733
I'm a player.
We ride spinners.

412
00:24:01,817 --> 00:24:04,194
Ride spinners
and you write on bombs.

413
00:24:04,236 --> 00:24:05,654
That's classified.

414
00:24:05,737 --> 00:24:07,072
I'm gonna tell you what.

415
00:24:07,155 --> 00:24:09,950
Get us there safe.
Can you do that?

416
00:24:10,033 --> 00:24:12,411
You somethin' else, Muggs.
Drew on bombs.

417
00:24:12,494 --> 00:24:14,913
- Excuse me, man,
- Yes, sir.

418
00:24:14,955 --> 00:24:16,540
That's about a bitch.

419
00:24:16,582 --> 00:24:18,625
- Where the cockpit at?
- You got that bong?

420
00:24:18,709 --> 00:24:21,170
Whole bag of it, Preach.

421
00:24:21,253 --> 00:24:23,338
- I gotta go.
- Do I pay you to talk on the phone?

422
00:24:23,422 --> 00:24:25,591
Look at the captain.
He is too cute.

423
00:24:28,927 --> 00:24:30,762
Hi, Captain.

424
00:24:30,846 --> 00:24:33,932
- At ease, ladies.
- Hi, fly boy.

425
00:24:34,057 --> 00:24:35,851
I just love the look
of a man in uniform.

426
00:24:37,102 --> 00:24:40,230
'Course, I like the look of a man
out of uniform even better.

427
00:24:43,734 --> 00:24:47,404
This is some cool shit
fit for a real nigga.

428
00:24:47,487 --> 00:24:50,199
Hey, what's poppin',
my aeronautical hustlers?

429
00:24:50,282 --> 00:24:51,783
Captain Mack,
reporting to duty.

430
00:24:51,867 --> 00:24:53,952
How you doin'. Captain?
I'm Riggs. your flight engineer.

431
00:24:54,036 --> 00:24:55,204
Have you ever met Gaeman?

432
00:24:55,287 --> 00:24:58,415
I just seen one of them
fruity motherfuckers in the hallway.

433
00:24:58,457 --> 00:25:00,042
Nigga was eyeballin' me.

434
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:03,253
It's Gaeman, I am Leslie Gaeman,
your copilot.

435
00:25:03,337 --> 00:25:04,588
What's happenin'?

436
00:25:04,671 --> 00:25:06,798
It's a very prestigious
African name--

437
00:25:06,924 --> 00:25:10,302
not like "gay man,"
two men fucking together, naked,

438
00:25:10,385 --> 00:25:13,138
- in a bedroom. Not me.
- Whatever, homey.

439
00:25:13,222 --> 00:25:15,140
I like pussy like you.

440
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:18,560
- I can dig it.
- Yeah, you can dig it.

441
00:25:18,644 --> 00:25:20,854
Everybody will be pregnant
by the end of this flight.

442
00:25:21,772 --> 00:25:23,023
Hello.

443
00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:26,818
First class.
Right this way, big daddy.

444
00:25:28,487 --> 00:25:30,322
Welcome to NWA.

445
00:25:31,573 --> 00:25:34,243
Hi. How's everybody?

446
00:25:34,326 --> 00:25:36,912
Good. Wow, this is great!

447
00:25:36,995 --> 00:25:40,082
Oh, y'all are in low class.

448
00:25:40,165 --> 00:25:43,001
- What?
- Low class, straight back.

449
00:25:45,712 --> 00:25:47,172
This is nice, too.

450
00:25:47,256 --> 00:25:49,883
Dad, this actually
isn't that bad.

451
00:26:00,435 --> 00:26:02,354
What kind of UPN operation
is this?

452
00:26:02,396 --> 00:26:04,106
It's not so bad.

453
00:26:06,817 --> 00:26:08,652
All right, here we are.

454
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:15,117
Row 1 7 Chrysler.
Honey, you sit here.

455
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,410
Thank you.

456
00:26:16,493 --> 00:26:18,954
- Do I have to sit...
- How you doin'?

457
00:26:21,331 --> 00:26:24,334
You're gonna have to, okay?
Thank you.

458
00:26:24,376 --> 00:26:27,796
Let's please
put the divider down.

459
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:32,509
Do you have an "off" switch?
You need to lower the volume.

460
00:26:33,802 --> 00:26:35,387
Man, you give a black man
some money,

461
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:38,724
this is how the airline's
gonna look--plush, laid.

462
00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:41,018
It's makin' me feel sexy
already.

463
00:26:41,059 --> 00:26:42,394
This is a sexy plane.

464
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:44,813
They got it chromed out
with the white leather.

465
00:26:44,897 --> 00:26:47,232
I think this is alligator butt.

466
00:26:48,901 --> 00:26:50,611
Yeah, this is nice.

467
00:26:50,694 --> 00:26:52,863
Little treat for you
before the plane takes off, daddy,

468
00:26:52,905 --> 00:26:54,990
'cause you treat me so right.

469
00:26:55,073 --> 00:26:57,075
You nasty!

470
00:27:03,081 --> 00:27:04,291
Can I help you, sir?

471
00:27:04,374 --> 00:27:06,752
Everything's okay,
I'm just trying to find my seat,

472
00:27:12,674 --> 00:27:14,259
Boy, this a nice plane.

473
00:27:15,636 --> 00:27:17,638
Nice cushion they got
on these new planes.

474
00:27:17,721 --> 00:27:20,682
This must be
one of them 777's.

475
00:27:20,766 --> 00:27:23,477
7574327.

476
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,687
Where my seat? 777.

477
00:27:25,771 --> 00:27:27,397
The president
should fly on this plane.

478
00:27:29,733 --> 00:27:31,777
- Hello, sir.
- Hey, baby, how you doin'?

479
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:34,696
- I'm gonna show you to your seat.
- That's nice of you, cutie pie.

480
00:27:36,114 --> 00:27:38,492
- Here we are.
- Let me shake your hand.

481
00:27:38,575 --> 00:27:42,287
Come here. Oh, boy!
That's nice. Look at that.

482
00:27:42,371 --> 00:27:45,707
Boy, I can just hear everything.

483
00:27:45,791 --> 00:27:49,503
It's so beautiful in here.
Wait a minute.

484
00:27:49,628 --> 00:27:52,130
Somebody got
some nice perfume on.

485
00:27:52,256 --> 00:27:54,591
Is that
Victoria Don't Tell Nobody?

486
00:27:54,633 --> 00:27:58,428
- No.
- Is that Boujeronee?

487
00:27:59,638 --> 00:28:01,139
Not Boujeronee either.

488
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,976
I like the people
that don't talk back.

489
00:28:04,017 --> 00:28:05,811
Hard to get, I like that.

490
00:28:07,855 --> 00:28:09,147
Cabin attendant?

491
00:28:09,189 --> 00:28:10,440
Yes, sir?

492
00:28:10,524 --> 00:28:13,527
Howdy do.
Where are you, baby?

493
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:14,945
There you are.

494
00:28:14,987 --> 00:28:20,075
Get me a quadruple cognac
and a cola back.

495
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,954
You know, I'm scared to fly.
I'm used to ridin' buses.

496
00:28:24,037 --> 00:28:26,832
My little nephew
sent me on first class,

497
00:28:26,915 --> 00:28:28,625
because I'm a player.

498
00:28:29,501 --> 00:28:31,295
You smell good, too.

499
00:28:32,963 --> 00:28:36,216
I'm gonna have me some fun
on this plane here.

500
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:40,053
Okey-dokey. So you're
gonna be in...

501
00:28:42,472 --> 00:28:46,768
You're gonna go ahead
to low class, okay.

502
00:28:49,855 --> 00:28:51,982
- He tasted like chocolate.
- No way.

503
00:29:00,115 --> 00:29:02,034
My God, what's going on?

504
00:29:07,164 --> 00:29:08,582
Get the fuck out!

505
00:29:08,665 --> 00:29:10,667
What is he doing?
Watch him.

506
00:29:14,505 --> 00:29:16,381
Y'all better get his ass!

507
00:29:28,227 --> 00:29:30,437
You ain't goin' nowhere
without us, Osama.

508
00:29:30,562 --> 00:29:33,440
If you gots to go
to the bathroom, we goin' with you.

509
00:29:33,524 --> 00:29:35,901
She holdin'
and I'm shakin', player.

510
00:29:35,984 --> 00:29:38,570
- That's right.
- It's cool, y'all. We got this.

511
00:29:38,654 --> 00:29:40,447
We security up in here.
Look straight.

512
00:29:45,077 --> 00:29:46,286
- Hi.
- Hey.

513
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:48,455
This first class is incredible.

514
00:29:48,539 --> 00:29:50,999
Girl, this plane is off the hook.
Have you seen the owner?

515
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:54,503
He's young, black, and from
the pictures I've seen,

516
00:29:54,586 --> 00:29:55,671
he looks so good.

517
00:29:55,754 --> 00:29:57,172
I'm sure he's great.

518
00:29:57,256 --> 00:29:59,925
<i>- And he's paid.

521

<i>If the plane goes crazy,
then you will not be flyin'</i>

525
00:30:33,208 --> 00:30:36,003

<i>You're a survivor</i>

532
00:30:52,811 --> 00:30:54,813

547
00:31:40,526 --> 00:31:42,611

I gotta get outta here.

558
00:32:17,729 --> 00:32:19,690
Giselle, wait.

559
00:32:19,815 --> 00:32:21,775
Giselle, can you
wait a minute, please?

560
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:22,860
What, Nashawn?

561
00:32:22,943 --> 00:32:25,404
What do we possibly
have to talk about?

562
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,782
Wow, I mean, you look great.

563
00:32:31,118 --> 00:32:32,703
How you been?

564
00:32:32,786 --> 00:32:35,664
I've been fine. Just fine.

565
00:32:37,499 --> 00:32:38,792
Is that all?

566
00:32:39,918 --> 00:32:42,212
Actually, no, I mean.
I was doin' some thinkin'.

567
00:32:42,254 --> 00:32:43,714
and I wanna talk to you.

568
00:32:44,923 --> 00:32:47,009
Can I at least talk to you?

569
00:32:47,092 --> 00:32:49,887
Giselle, where you gonna go?
The door is closed.

570
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:54,057
What's this?

571
00:32:54,183 --> 00:32:55,934
Someone stepped up,
Nashawn.

572
00:32:56,018 --> 00:32:57,895
I'm engaged.

573
00:33:11,283 --> 00:33:14,661
Hey, baby. It's not
a good time right now.

574
00:33:17,956 --> 00:33:20,709
There's no easy way
for me...

575
00:33:20,792 --> 00:33:23,128
for me to say this...

576
00:33:24,838 --> 00:33:26,632
What?

577
00:33:26,757 --> 00:33:28,634
This isn't workin' for me
anymore.

578
00:33:28,675 --> 00:33:29,801
What's not workin'?

579
00:33:34,473 --> 00:33:37,100
- This is gettin' way too serious.
- What are you talkin' about?

580
00:33:40,771 --> 00:33:41,813
I can't do this anymore.

581
00:33:41,897 --> 00:33:43,857
- I can't.
- No.

582
00:33:45,317 --> 00:33:47,194
You got change of a 50, man?

583
00:33:50,823 --> 00:33:54,326
- Not right now, Muggs.
- Not now?

584
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:56,829
What's his problem, man?

585
00:34:04,545 --> 00:34:05,838
Oh, boy.

587
00:34:11,969 --> 00:34:16,515
I was wondering if I could
trouble you for a drink.

588
00:34:16,598 --> 00:34:18,851
Ain't no drink down there.

00:36:40,784 --> 00:36:41,785
Bounce, bounce.

624
00:36:43,495 --> 00:36:45,497
I have the perfect music
for this.

625
00:36:45,622 --> 00:36:47,833
Yes, I have it right here.

626
00:36:55,048 --> 00:36:56,592
Hey, man, hold on, man.

627
00:36:56,675 --> 00:36:59,094
- Hold the fuck on.
- Like elephant.

628
00:36:59,178 --> 00:37:01,555
No, man, you gotta
turn that bullshit off.

629
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,307
We can't be ridin'
to that bullshit, man.

630
00:37:03,348 --> 00:37:04,558
Don't insult my music.

631
00:37:04,641 --> 00:37:07,102
We ridin' to some gangsta shit.
Pop that in, man.

632
00:37:07,186 --> 00:37:09,479
Captain don't wanna hear
that Zimbabwe ah-wah-wah shit.

633
00:37:09,521 --> 00:37:11,857
Get that shit out.
Get it the fuck outta here.

634
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,734
I'm the captain
of this motherfuckin' ship.

635
00:38:15,879 --> 00:38:18,882
Captain, what the hell
is wrong with you?

636
00:38:22,052 --> 00:38:24,221
Man, I'm afraid of heights.

637
00:38:24,304 --> 00:38:25,889
Afraid of heights?!

638
00:38:31,061 --> 00:38:33,230
Hit her with a bat,
hit her with a bat

639
00:38:33,313 --> 00:38:35,107
Hit her with a whoo-whoo

640
00:38:38,443 --> 00:38:42,072
- Easy, Kobe. She's 17.
- Dad, I'm 18.

641
00:38:49,997 --> 00:38:51,874
Honey, I'm gonna
excuse myself

642
00:38:51,957 --> 00:38:54,793
- and go to the restroom.
- Okay.

643
00:38:58,797 --> 00:39:01,258
I think I'm gonna go
check out the plane.

644
00:39:01,341 --> 00:39:02,634
Is that all right?

645
00:39:02,718 --> 00:39:06,305
- Why are you so nice to me?
- Stay for a while.

646
00:39:11,435 --> 00:39:14,730
Oh, my sweet black Jesus!

647
00:39:17,107 --> 00:39:18,358
Hey, good evenin'.

648
00:39:18,442 --> 00:39:19,776
I didn't know
anybody was in here.

649
00:39:19,818 --> 00:39:22,321
- I'll come back later.
- Why? I'm still gonna be here.

650
00:39:22,404 --> 00:39:23,780
I tell you what.

651
00:39:23,822 --> 00:39:26,325
You take care of your business,
I take care of mine.

652
00:39:26,366 --> 00:39:29,161
I just don't feel comfortable,
I'll just hold it.

653
00:39:29,203 --> 00:39:31,205
You don't want to do that.

654
00:39:31,288 --> 00:39:34,958
That stuff back up on you,
top of your head fly clean off.

655
00:39:35,083 --> 00:39:36,460
Sit down,
make yourself at home.

656
00:39:36,502 --> 00:39:37,711
I'm sorry.

657
00:39:37,794 --> 00:39:40,422
We don't get that many of y'all
on the plane.

658
00:39:40,506 --> 00:39:42,966
For those with no junk
in their trunk.

659
00:39:43,842 --> 00:39:45,177
That is a nice vest.

660
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:47,471
I ain't seen one of them
since Lionel and the Jeffersons.

661
00:39:47,554 --> 00:39:50,307
What ever happened to Lionel?
I thought he was--

662
00:39:50,349 --> 00:39:51,350
Would you mind?

663
00:39:51,433 --> 00:39:53,894
Oh, I'm sorry.
Little fella kinda shy?

664
00:39:59,066 --> 00:40:00,609
Goddamn!

665
00:40:00,692 --> 00:40:01,944
Sorry.

666
00:40:02,027 --> 00:40:04,112
I guess you can't have lightnin'
without the thunder.

667
00:40:04,196 --> 00:40:06,198
Somebody still likes
that pork, I see.

668
00:40:06,281 --> 00:40:09,868
I think this was a false alarm.
I'm gonna go back to my seat.

669
00:40:09,993 --> 00:40:11,161
The paint is peeling.

670
00:40:12,871 --> 00:40:14,581
That must be a big one.

671
00:40:14,665 --> 00:40:16,291
Yeah, it's big.

672
00:40:16,375 --> 00:40:17,584
I've got just the thing.

673
00:40:38,772 --> 00:40:42,234
I can't believe that
this is you.

674
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:44,278
So you subscribe to
"Black & Proud"?

675
00:40:44,361 --> 00:40:47,447
This is the first time
I've picked it up.

676
00:40:47,531 --> 00:40:49,616
Yeah, it was freezin'
that day.

677
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:53,495
Really? You could never tell that
from the picture.

678
00:40:53,579 --> 00:40:55,455
Why, thank you.

679
00:40:55,539 --> 00:40:58,917
Usually, the problem is, I'm hangin'
out the bottom of my boxers.

680
00:40:58,959 --> 00:41:01,044
Oh, my goodness.

681
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:02,838
Hi.

682
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,923
I think you're in my seat.

683
00:41:05,007 --> 00:41:07,426
Oh, hi, honey.
This is Jerome.

684
00:41:07,509 --> 00:41:08,552
Hi.

685
00:41:08,635 --> 00:41:09,636
Hello.

686
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:13,432
Jerome was telling me about how he
hangs out the bottom of his boxers.

687
00:41:13,557 --> 00:41:15,309
That's nice.

688
00:41:15,392 --> 00:41:17,060
They're about to serve dinner,

689
00:41:17,144 --> 00:41:19,021
so you might want
to go back to your chair.

690
00:41:21,106 --> 00:41:24,401
Oh, yeah. You're right.

691
00:41:24,443 --> 00:41:25,569
Yeah.

692
00:41:25,611 --> 00:41:27,196
It was nice meetin' you.

693
00:41:27,279 --> 00:41:28,780
It was nice meeting you, too, Barbara.

694
00:41:28,864 --> 00:41:30,991
Nice meeting you, too, Jerome.

695
00:41:33,452 --> 00:41:34,495
Bye.

696
00:41:40,542 --> 00:41:42,753
Hangin' out
the bottom of his boxers--

697
00:41:42,794 --> 00:41:44,338
My God, is that him?!

698
00:41:45,964 --> 00:41:49,885
- That thing has a face on it,
- No, but it's gonna.

699
00:41:52,304 --> 00:41:53,347
Are you all right, sir?

700
00:41:53,472 --> 00:41:55,933
Course, I'm all right,
I'm a G, ain't I?

701
00:41:56,016 --> 00:41:57,518
I will make the announcement.

702
00:41:57,601 --> 00:42:00,103
No, you won't.
Give me this motherfucker.

703
00:42:00,187 --> 00:42:02,272
I'm makin' the announcement.
I'm the captain.

704
00:42:02,648 --> 00:42:06,527
Ladies and gentlemen, we have
reached our cruising altitude

705
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:08,529
of 33,000 feet,

706
00:42:08,612 --> 00:42:10,697
33,000 feet?!

707
00:42:10,781 --> 00:42:13,951
Oh, shit, man. We fuckin' higher
than Redman at the Source awards.

708
00:42:14,034 --> 00:42:15,994
<i>Shit don't make
no motherfuckin' sense</i>

709
00:42:16,036 --> 00:42:17,538
<i>to be this high, cuz.</i>

710
00:42:17,663 --> 00:42:20,374
Man, I feel sick. Oh, fuck.

711
00:42:22,584 --> 00:42:23,961
Ain't this some shit?

712
00:42:27,297 --> 00:42:28,757
What the hell's goin' on here?

713
00:42:28,841 --> 00:42:30,843
This nigga's afraid of heights.

714
00:42:30,926 --> 00:42:33,262
How you gonna be afraid
of heights if you the captain?

715
00:42:33,345 --> 00:42:34,930
I ain't never
been off the ground before.

716
00:42:35,013 --> 00:42:36,515
We've flown computer
simulators.

717
00:42:36,598 --> 00:42:40,561
You told me you got your wings
when you got out the Air Force.

718
00:42:40,644 --> 00:42:42,187
No, I didn't.

719
00:42:42,271 --> 00:42:44,481
I told you I got my wings
when I got out.

720
00:42:44,523 --> 00:42:47,234
When I got out of Pelican Bay
State Corrections Facility.

721
00:42:47,317 --> 00:42:50,362
It was either get a GED
or take a pilot class.

722
00:42:50,445 --> 00:42:52,447
You learned how to fly
in the prison?

723
00:42:52,531 --> 00:42:54,533
Hey, man, don't get mad
'cause I spent your money

724
00:42:54,575 --> 00:42:55,534
to get a good education.

725
00:42:55,659 --> 00:42:59,580
Shit, me and my homeboys
passed the class with flying colors.

726
00:42:59,663 --> 00:43:01,665
Let me see.

727
00:43:01,748 --> 00:43:04,001
- I miss them niggas, man.
- Those are his niggas.

728
00:43:04,042 --> 00:43:05,669
The Taliban.

729
00:43:06,712 --> 00:43:08,463
I'm gonna tell you what.

730
00:43:08,547 --> 00:43:11,550
Y'all better fix it.
Gay-man, Captain Mack--

731
00:43:11,633 --> 00:43:12,634
It's Gaeman!

732
00:43:12,718 --> 00:43:14,553
I don't give a damn.
Fix it.

733
00:43:14,636 --> 00:43:16,555
I'm no bitch, you understand?
It's Gaeman.

734
00:43:16,638 --> 00:43:19,057
You gonna be a gay man.
Fix it.

735
00:43:19,099 --> 00:43:21,018
Put this shit on autopilot.

736
00:43:21,059 --> 00:43:23,687
I'm goin' to the lavatory.
I got to boo-boo.

737
00:43:26,815 --> 00:43:29,610
- What ya doin'?
- I'm countin' my tips.

738
00:43:29,693 --> 00:43:32,654
- Tips from where?
- Back there,

739
00:43:36,658 --> 00:43:38,577
...low class motherfucker.

740
00:43:43,123 --> 00:43:45,792
Hey, nigga! Oh, boss man.

741
00:43:49,379 --> 00:43:50,672
Hey, man, you mind
if I get in here?

742
00:43:50,756 --> 00:43:51,757
Come on.

743
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:54,718
Hold on. Got a new shooter.

744
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:57,012
- One shot, baby, you in?
- No.

745
00:43:57,095 --> 00:43:58,430
Nigga, is ya in? What?

746
00:43:58,514 --> 00:44:00,432
- You said I could run business class, right?
- Yeah, I did.

747
00:44:00,557 --> 00:44:02,684
So I'm runnin' this motherfucker
like Vegas on fight night.

748
00:44:02,768 --> 00:44:04,603
We got a cockfight
we settin' up in ten minutes.

749
00:44:04,645 --> 00:44:06,605
Cockfight?! I'm in.

750
00:44:08,774 --> 00:44:10,651
No. Let me tell you over here.

751
00:44:10,734 --> 00:44:12,611
I don't even want
everybody in my business.

752
00:44:12,653 --> 00:44:13,904
Hold me down.

753
00:44:16,698 --> 00:44:18,992
- What's up, cuz?
- You know what?

754
00:44:19,076 --> 00:44:20,452
I'm not even gonna make
a scene in here.

755
00:44:20,536 --> 00:44:22,538
I'm goin' back
to the front of the plane.

756
00:44:22,621 --> 00:44:25,749
When I get back here,
I want this to be business class.

757
00:44:25,791 --> 00:44:28,836
- Okay. You got it, man.
- You can do that for me?

758
00:44:28,919 --> 00:44:30,629
My man. Thank you, Muggs.

759
00:44:35,717 --> 00:44:37,344
Would you like
champagne or wine?

760
00:44:37,469 --> 00:44:38,470
We'll have champagne.

761
00:44:38,595 --> 00:44:40,180
Would you like Moet or Cristal?

762
00:44:41,932 --> 00:44:45,102
Motit...et. Moet.

763
00:44:45,185 --> 00:44:46,854
All right.

764
00:44:46,937 --> 00:44:49,565
I know you have a drinking problem,
so please drink slow.

765
00:44:50,941 --> 00:44:54,444
That's for you. And sir,
please don't swallow your ice.

766
00:44:54,486 --> 00:44:56,071
That's all I can afford
to give you.

767
00:44:57,239 --> 00:45:01,285
Hello. Would you like Colt .45
or Alizé?

768
00:45:03,745 --> 00:45:05,581
Maybe you could explain to us
what those are.

769
00:45:05,664 --> 00:45:06,999
My pleasure, sir.

770
00:45:07,082 --> 00:45:09,543
Colt .45 tastes like
liquored-up beer,

771
00:45:09,626 --> 00:45:11,670
and it sneaks up on you
all of a sudden.

772
00:45:13,005 --> 00:45:15,716
And Alizé--oh, that's my favorite.
It's from France.

773
00:45:15,799 --> 00:45:17,509
It's a cog-nac, it's very fruity,

774
00:45:17,593 --> 00:45:19,469
and it'll make you wanna do
the hucklebuck,

775
00:45:19,511 --> 00:45:21,805
then pass out
in your own juices.

776
00:45:21,847 --> 00:45:23,182
Guess I'll have that.

777
00:45:23,223 --> 00:45:24,558
Wise choice.

778
00:45:24,641 --> 00:45:26,977
Yo, player, you got a little
somethin'-somethin' for me?

779
00:45:27,019 --> 00:45:29,188
Yeah, I have a shorty 40.

780
00:45:29,271 --> 00:45:32,649
No, no. Do you have
any whole milk?

781
00:45:32,691 --> 00:45:33,692
Sir, that is nasty.

782
00:45:33,775 --> 00:45:37,821
I do have a Puerto Rican lady who's
lactatin', I'll see what I can do.

783
00:45:39,531 --> 00:45:42,034
Tonight, we're serving a plate
of gourmet soul food

784
00:45:42,159 --> 00:45:44,536
with your choice of lobster
and filet mignon

785
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:47,247
or crisp duck confit,

786
00:45:47,331 --> 00:45:48,707
I'll have the filet,

787
00:45:53,879 --> 00:45:55,339
And for you, sir?

788
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:58,717
I ordered a special
Kosher meal... yag-weh.

789
00:45:58,759 --> 00:46:00,010
Excuse me?

790
00:46:00,093 --> 00:46:02,012
That's fried chicken
in hot sauce.

791
00:46:02,054 --> 00:46:05,307
Lobster, filet mignon or duck?

792
00:46:05,390 --> 00:46:07,851
I'll take the fee-lan.

793
00:46:09,561 --> 00:46:12,397
All right, I need you to take
a breast or a leg and a wing

794
00:46:12,481 --> 00:46:14,650
and pass it back. Exactly.

795
00:46:14,733 --> 00:46:17,027
You guys, share your napkins
with your neighbor.

796
00:46:17,069 --> 00:46:19,988
One for every two people.
Sharing is caring.

797
00:46:20,072 --> 00:46:21,406
Don't get greedy. One piece.

798
00:46:21,448 --> 00:46:24,034
Hi. Would you like
some dessert?

799
00:46:26,662 --> 00:46:28,622
Boss man, low class
is outta liquor,

800
00:46:28,705 --> 00:46:31,291
so I thought I would
come in here and...

801
00:46:35,879 --> 00:46:38,340
Someone is strollin' down
memory lane.

802
00:46:40,717 --> 00:46:43,720
No, I'm just, you know,
checkin' on things,

803
00:46:43,804 --> 00:46:45,305
makin' sure they okay,
that's all.

804
00:46:45,389 --> 00:46:47,516
Yeah, right. I know that look.

805
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:50,602
I had that same look of regret
after I ran into Lee--

806
00:46:50,727 --> 00:46:53,230
my little Asian butterfly.

807
00:46:53,313 --> 00:46:56,692
We had a whirlwind romance
that ended in heartbreak...

808
00:46:56,775 --> 00:46:58,944
and stomach pumpin'.

809
00:46:59,027 --> 00:47:03,407
When I saw him again,
I tried to apologize, but I couldn't.

810
00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:06,076
I just felt so bad leaving him
in that hospital

811
00:47:06,118 --> 00:47:07,828
all bloated and distended.

812
00:47:07,911 --> 00:47:09,079
Did you just grind on me?

813
00:47:09,121 --> 00:47:10,581
A little.

814
00:47:10,622 --> 00:47:12,958
What does that sick-ass story
have to do with me?

815
00:47:13,041 --> 00:47:14,960
I've never left nobody
in the hospital filled with nothin'.

816
00:47:15,043 --> 00:47:17,254
It means, Mr. Righteous,
that if you have a chance

817
00:47:17,379 --> 00:47:18,922
to make things right again,
you should take it.

818
00:47:19,006 --> 00:47:20,757
Who knows
what could've happened?

819
00:47:20,883 --> 00:47:25,262
Lee had plenty ancient secret
to show me.

820
00:47:25,304 --> 00:47:28,390
Thank you. Flame.
Okay?

821
00:47:28,473 --> 00:47:30,434
You're welcome.

822
00:47:35,022 --> 00:47:38,484
Now, how much Colt .45
to Sierra Mist do you mix

823
00:47:38,525 --> 00:47:41,069
to get bubbly?
Probably half and half.

824
00:47:42,446 --> 00:47:43,572
You mind if I sit down?

825
00:47:43,655 --> 00:47:45,115
It's your plane.

826
00:47:47,493 --> 00:47:49,328
It really doesn't have
to be like this.

827
00:47:49,369 --> 00:47:50,662
How is it supposed to be?

828
00:47:52,498 --> 00:47:54,750
So who's this guy?

829
00:47:57,336 --> 00:47:59,254
Let's just let it go, okay?

830
00:48:00,797 --> 00:48:03,467
I just came over here
to talk to you.

831
00:48:04,927 --> 00:48:07,012
You just disappeared.
I didn't even hear from you.

832
00:48:07,095 --> 00:48:10,682
Giselle, you were 3,000 miles away.
I tried to get in touch with you.

833
00:48:12,684 --> 00:48:14,686
Let's just let it go.

834
00:48:34,706 --> 00:48:39,378
I don't know what smells better--
this meal or your delightful perfume.

835
00:48:39,461 --> 00:48:41,964
Thank you. You're too kind.

836
00:48:42,047 --> 00:48:46,927
You know, a lot of smart women
find blind men sexy.

837
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:48,178
- You know why?
- No.

838
00:48:48,262 --> 00:48:50,013
But I'm sure
you're about to tell me.

839
00:48:50,055 --> 00:48:54,434
When you lose one sense,
it makes your other senses stronger,

840
00:48:54,518 --> 00:48:56,895
I have more of a sensitive touch
than the average man,

841
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:58,021
Please!

842
00:48:59,815 --> 00:49:01,275
Let me tell you about
this love I had,

843
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,986
She was on the trampoline,
landed right in my lap.

844
00:49:04,069 --> 00:49:05,988
Bang! She stayed there
for 1 5 years.

845
00:49:06,071 --> 00:49:09,032
People crazy about me.
People love me.

846
00:49:09,116 --> 00:49:10,742
- You don't say.
- Don't say?

847
00:49:10,826 --> 00:49:12,703
I do say it.
That's what I'm talkin' about.

848
00:49:12,744 --> 00:49:14,830
People love me.
See these fingers here?

849
00:49:14,913 --> 00:49:19,042
These fingers got eyes on 'em
just like 20/20 vision.

850
00:49:19,084 --> 00:49:21,044
You know what I mean?

851
00:49:21,086 --> 00:49:24,840
They... wait a minute.

852
00:49:24,923 --> 00:49:26,550
Move that other leg
out the way.

853
00:49:26,633 --> 00:49:28,093
Move that dress up, girl.

854
00:49:28,135 --> 00:49:31,180
Oh, boy, moist.
You just as tender as you can be.

855
00:49:31,263 --> 00:49:34,641
You a little frisky thing.
You got a little puddle here.

856
00:49:35,851 --> 00:49:37,853
Oh, you big, too.
You ain't no baby.

857
00:49:37,936 --> 00:49:41,273
This is wonderful.
I love freaky stuff like this.

858
00:49:41,356 --> 00:49:43,609
Just let yourself go.
I'm gonna let myself go, too.

859
00:49:43,692 --> 00:49:44,735
I'm feelin' something, too.

860
00:49:44,776 --> 00:49:48,405
This ain't like me.
I don't usually go this quick.

861
00:49:48,447 --> 00:49:49,490
I'm goin' now.

862
00:50:04,046 --> 00:50:06,340
Let me tell you.
Where my yack?

863
00:50:16,141 --> 00:50:19,978
I'm a player... player!

864
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:22,105
- Hey, now.
- Oh, excuse me,

865
00:50:22,147 --> 00:50:24,149
No, it's cool,
I'm the attendant,

866
00:50:24,191 --> 00:50:25,818
You can sit this one out,
my brother.

867
00:50:25,901 --> 00:50:27,569
I'm just gonna wash my hands.

868
00:50:27,653 --> 00:50:29,238
Got me a wild woman
sittin' next to me

869
00:50:29,321 --> 00:50:32,991
and look what I got.
Bang! Stinky pinky.

870
00:50:33,826 --> 00:50:35,369
Stinky pinky, here you go.

871
00:50:35,452 --> 00:50:38,121
Hey, brother. I ain't washin'
that one, I'm washin' this one.

872
00:50:39,957 --> 00:50:43,919
She usin' cilantro.
I love that freaky shit.

873
00:50:45,671 --> 00:50:47,506
The only way you got
stinky pinky

874
00:50:47,589 --> 00:50:49,466
is if you was sittin' next to
Miss Potato Head.

875
00:50:49,508 --> 00:50:51,718
There's always some dude
who's a player hater

876
00:50:51,802 --> 00:50:52,886
'cause he ain't gettin' none.

877
00:50:56,181 --> 00:50:58,892
Just 'cause you blind don't mean
I won't whip your ass.

878
00:50:58,976 --> 00:51:01,353
Lookin' like a disco lemon.
Son of a bitch!

879
00:51:01,478 --> 00:51:05,065
All right, you suit-and-tie-wearin'
motherfuckers.

880
00:51:05,107 --> 00:51:07,651
A little green
gets you in between.

881
00:51:07,734 --> 00:51:10,946
The more dough,
the more they show.

882
00:51:11,029 --> 00:51:13,991
Now, a true player
is a payer, am I right?

883
00:51:14,032 --> 00:51:15,033
That's what's up.

884
00:51:15,159 --> 00:51:18,036
We don't park collars
at NWA--we park dollars.

885
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:19,329
You heard me?

886
00:51:19,371 --> 00:51:23,542
If you can afford business class,
you can afford some business ass.

887
00:51:23,625 --> 00:51:26,170
Hey, Muggs, what's goin' on?

888
00:51:26,253 --> 00:51:28,338
- Where?
- Here.

889
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:32,009
- Here. What is this?
- It's all good up in here, baby.

890
00:51:32,050 --> 00:51:34,761
We got Asian persuasion,
butter pecan freakin',

891
00:51:34,845 --> 00:51:35,888
chocolate deluxe.

892
00:51:35,971 --> 00:51:38,140
I got it all
in my little shopping mall.

893
00:51:38,223 --> 00:51:40,017
What is it you're not gettin'?

894
00:51:40,058 --> 00:51:44,188
First gamblin', now this?
It's illegal, man.

895
00:51:44,271 --> 00:51:45,772
You with the FAA, nigga?

896
00:51:45,898 --> 00:51:47,816
- No. What are you talkin' about?
- Ain't no rules in the air.

897
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:49,818
Listen to me.
That's not the point, man.

898
00:51:49,902 --> 00:51:53,030
It's a family airline.
You got ladies up in here?

899
00:51:53,071 --> 00:51:54,072
I sure do!

900
00:51:55,908 --> 00:51:58,785
Listen to me.
We not in the 'hood no more.

901
00:51:58,869 --> 00:51:59,953
Hey, Nashawn.

902
00:52:00,078 --> 00:52:02,789
Hey! What's this about?

903
00:52:02,831 --> 00:52:04,458
The girls just wanted
to show their appreciation

904
00:52:04,541 --> 00:52:06,502
for everything you've done.

905
00:52:06,585 --> 00:52:07,920
If you stick around for a minute.

906
00:52:08,003 --> 00:52:10,756
I'm sure it'd make the ladies
very, very happy.

907
00:52:10,839 --> 00:52:11,924
Start with this.

908
00:52:13,175 --> 00:52:14,927
Just like that?

909
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:16,011
You're so sexy.

910
00:52:16,094 --> 00:52:18,096
Whoa! Slow down!

911
00:52:19,264 --> 00:52:20,349
Back up.

912
00:52:20,432 --> 00:52:23,894
Oh, my God!
Hey, move, devil.

913
00:52:23,977 --> 00:52:25,187
Get it together
and get it fast.

914
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:26,688
You got to get off the pole.

915
00:52:26,772 --> 00:52:29,483
Hey, baby, watch your step.
Hey.

916
00:52:30,943 --> 00:52:32,528
I guess there are some things
you can commit to.

917
00:52:32,611 --> 00:52:34,822
You talkin' 'bout this?

918
00:52:36,073 --> 00:52:37,699
I'm just doin' my job,
that's all.

919
00:52:37,783 --> 00:52:39,243
Yeah, it looks like
you're a workaholic.

920
00:52:40,369 --> 00:52:42,663
And here I was thinkin' I was
too hard on you before.

921
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:46,583
Guess you're the man now.

922
00:52:50,295 --> 00:52:51,880
Wait, Giselle.

923
00:52:55,634 --> 00:52:57,386
What the fuck am I doin'?!

924
00:53:02,724 --> 00:53:04,101
You ready for this?

925
00:53:04,142 --> 00:53:05,143
- Yeah.
- You ready?

926
00:53:05,227 --> 00:53:06,228
Oh, yeah, daddy.

927
00:53:06,311 --> 00:53:07,688
- You sure?
- Wait.

928
00:53:07,771 --> 00:53:09,356
Don't fight the feelin', baby.

929
00:53:12,776 --> 00:53:14,736
What the hell is you doin'
in here?

930
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:17,406
That's the problem with
you young cats. You talk too much.

931
00:53:17,489 --> 00:53:18,907
- A woman like that...
- You do talk a lot.

932
00:53:18,991 --> 00:53:20,701
...wants a man of action.

933
00:53:21,451 --> 00:53:24,955
I was wonderin' if you can
help my friend Ben here.

934
00:53:25,038 --> 00:53:26,999
He needs you to take him
back to his seat.

935
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,459
Yeah, Ben, I believe I know
where this cat is sittin'.

936
00:53:30,711 --> 00:53:33,422
Dig this here.
You don't need a lot of space.

937
00:53:33,505 --> 00:53:35,382
Superman changed
in a phone booth.

938
00:53:35,465 --> 00:53:39,052
Hey, don't be...
man, don't be touchin'...

939
00:53:39,136 --> 00:53:40,512
Tidy Bowl man.

940
00:53:40,554 --> 00:53:41,972
We gonna need this right here.

941
00:53:46,018 --> 00:53:48,479
- Ready for this?
- Oh, yeah.

942
00:53:48,562 --> 00:53:50,314
Hey, what the hell is this?

943
00:53:50,397 --> 00:53:51,857
I seen this on an episode
of "Real Sex".

944
00:53:51,899 --> 00:53:53,942
- You sure about this?
- Trust me.

945
00:53:54,026 --> 00:53:55,777
All you gotta do
is have a safety word.

946
00:53:55,861 --> 00:53:56,862
You got one?

947
00:53:56,945 --> 00:53:58,489
Yeah, when I say.
"Get off me, you crazy bitch",

948
00:53:58,572 --> 00:53:59,781
you stop chokin' me.

949
00:54:01,533 --> 00:54:02,576
Ow! Shit!

950
00:54:05,204 --> 00:54:06,663
Actually, I wish you'd stop
smackin' me.

951
00:54:06,705 --> 00:54:07,748
You like it.

952
00:54:07,873 --> 00:54:09,791
- It's tight.
- It's supposed to be tight.

953
00:54:09,875 --> 00:54:10,918
That's why you buy me
the good shit.

954
00:54:11,001 --> 00:54:13,212
The belt is too damn tight!

955
00:54:13,295 --> 00:54:17,299
Stop your bitch-ass complainin'
and give me what you promised.

956
00:54:19,510 --> 00:54:21,261
I can't feel my toes!

957
00:54:21,345 --> 00:54:23,764
I can't feel your dick,
but I ain't complainin'.

958
00:54:23,847 --> 00:54:27,059
D.J., please, don't stop.
Five more seconds.

959
00:54:37,194 --> 00:54:40,823
Cheese, eggs, grits, chilies,
yams, sunflower seeds.

960
00:54:42,699 --> 00:54:45,452
No. No!

961
00:54:45,536 --> 00:54:46,537
No?

962
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:49,206
Man, this is not the way
it happened on "Real Sex".

963
00:54:49,289 --> 00:54:51,250
This is some real bullshit.

964
00:54:51,333 --> 00:54:52,626
It was probably the turbulence

965
00:54:52,709 --> 00:54:56,380
and all the excituration
of the moment, 'cause I used--

966
00:54:56,421 --> 00:54:59,675
You see that, David.
Did you see that, David?

967
00:54:59,758 --> 00:55:01,426
Why you always got to go--

968
00:55:01,552 --> 00:55:03,720
I need to spank you
with the bad...

969
00:55:03,929 --> 00:55:05,430
I'm gonna punish him.

970
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:09,393
This motherfuckin' autopilot shit
is cool as hell, man.

971
00:55:09,476 --> 00:55:11,937
Just kick back
and ride and glide.

972
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:15,566
Relax, motherfucker.
I should be captain of this plane.

973
00:55:15,691 --> 00:55:18,652
Ten years with Chuku Airlines.

974
00:55:18,735 --> 00:55:21,905
Chuku Airlines, where we treat you
with a lot of respect.

975
00:55:21,947 --> 00:55:23,824
This motherfucker.

976
00:55:23,907 --> 00:55:26,034
Now I'm here with this nigga.

977
00:55:27,286 --> 00:55:30,539
Nigga, shut the fuck up with that
African mumbo-jumbo bullshit.

978
00:55:30,622 --> 00:55:33,000
I hear you over there
with that Chuku Airlines shit.

979
00:55:33,083 --> 00:55:35,127
You with NWA Airlines,
I'm the captain.

980
00:55:35,210 --> 00:55:37,254
- I don't care.
- Real niggas drive real shit.

981
00:55:37,337 --> 00:55:38,338
I should kill you.

982
00:55:39,965 --> 00:55:41,842
We have a birthday girl,
Captain.

983
00:55:41,925 --> 00:55:43,218
This is Heather Hunkee.

984
00:55:43,302 --> 00:55:45,679
She wanted to see
our cockpit.

985
00:55:45,804 --> 00:55:47,264
How old are you, Heather?

986
00:55:47,306 --> 00:55:48,307
I just turned 18.

987
00:55:48,432 --> 00:55:50,851
Is that right? Oh, boy.

988
00:55:50,934 --> 00:55:53,145
Attention, all players.

989
00:55:53,228 --> 00:55:56,231
The upper deck will be open
for your enjoyment.

990
00:55:56,315 --> 00:55:59,443
We have a passenger
who just turned 18 years old.

991
00:55:59,526 --> 00:56:00,944
Her name is Heather Hunkee.

992
00:56:01,028 --> 00:56:05,032
She is one cute little hottie
with a whole lotta body.

993
00:56:05,073 --> 00:56:06,783
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

994
00:56:06,825 --> 00:56:10,162
She'll be upstairs, so all players
come up and keep her company.

995
00:56:10,204 --> 00:56:13,832
No!

996
00:56:21,423 --> 00:56:24,301
Hey, Virgie, how are you?
Good to see you.

997
00:56:24,343 --> 00:56:25,886
Yeah, I know. It's hot, right?

998
00:56:26,011 --> 00:56:27,888
This is hot.

999
00:56:27,971 --> 00:56:30,432
Let me take you to the bar.
Give me your jacket, girl.

1000
00:56:34,186 --> 00:56:36,897
Big Boy!

1001
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:38,690
All my pimps, players,
and hustlers--

1002
00:56:38,774 --> 00:56:41,735
y'all ready to set this motherfucker
off, West Coast style?

1003
00:56:41,819 --> 00:56:43,987
As you see,
we up in the clouds.

1004
00:56:44,029 --> 00:56:46,365
Got a gang of lovely ladies
out there on the dance floor

1005
00:56:46,448 --> 00:56:49,159
ready to go ahead and shake
that ass and get they freak on.

1006
00:56:49,201 --> 00:56:51,161
To my fellas out there
who ain't got no game--

1007
00:56:51,245 --> 00:56:52,496
yeah, I'm talkin' to you.

1008
00:56:52,621 --> 00:56:55,040
Don't even trip on it,
'cause we ain't goin' nowhere.

1009
00:56:55,082 --> 00:56:58,001
We locked in this bitch for
four more hours till we touch down,

1010
00:56:58,043 --> 00:57:00,212
so you might as well go ahead
and get your swerve on.

1011
00:57:00,337 --> 00:57:04,007
- Marshall, good to see you.
- It's good to see you.

1012
00:57:04,049 --> 00:57:06,385
This is Heather.
She's turnin' 18 today.

1013
00:57:06,468 --> 00:57:07,636
Happy birthday.

1014
00:57:07,719 --> 00:57:10,055
- Thank you.
- Captain Mack is buyin' her

1015
00:57:10,138 --> 00:57:11,306
her first drink.

1016
00:57:11,390 --> 00:57:12,808
What can I get for you?

1017
00:57:12,891 --> 00:57:14,560
Surprise me.

1018
00:57:14,643 --> 00:57:16,061
I got just what you need.

1019
00:57:17,312 --> 00:57:19,398
Girl, he is cute!

1020
00:57:19,481 --> 00:57:20,691
I know. He's a looker.

1021
00:57:22,526 --> 00:57:23,944
He'll hook you up.

1022
00:57:31,827 --> 00:57:35,038
Cool! All right, have a good time.
I gotta go back downstairs.

1023
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:36,331
Keep an eye on her.

1024
00:57:36,415 --> 00:57:37,833
Oh, I will.

1025
00:57:37,916 --> 00:57:39,543
Not that kind of eye.

1026
00:57:39,585 --> 00:57:40,961
It's Big Boy.

1027
00:57:41,044 --> 00:57:42,212
What's goin' down, y'all?

1028
00:57:42,296 --> 00:57:44,173
We gonna keep
this motherfucker crackin'

1029
00:57:44,256 --> 00:57:46,466
until everybody in here
pass the fuck out.

1030
00:57:51,513 --> 00:57:53,724
Yeah, this is my joint
right here.

1031
00:58:07,446 --> 00:58:10,616
- Who'd you come here with?
- Don't worry about that.

1032
00:58:10,699 --> 00:58:13,118
- Please, Captain, I just--
- Hey, nigga!

1033
00:58:13,202 --> 00:58:14,995
What part of "you ain't flyin'
this motherfuckin' plane"

1034
00:58:15,078 --> 00:58:16,622
don't you understand?

1035
00:58:16,705 --> 00:58:18,749
Sit back and enjoy the ride,
Idi Amin.

1036
00:58:23,879 --> 00:58:26,131
What are you doing?
You fool!

1037
00:58:26,215 --> 00:58:28,842
Any motherfuckin' dry ass
mushrooms of yours

1038
00:58:28,926 --> 00:58:30,886
ain't gettin' me high
no motherfuckin' way.

1039
00:58:30,969 --> 00:58:33,013
You need to fuck with the white boys.
They shit potent.

1040
00:58:33,138 --> 00:58:34,389
White boys, American shit.

1041
00:58:34,473 --> 00:58:36,433
This is African mushrooms,
very dangerous.

1042
00:58:36,475 --> 00:58:37,476
They can kill you!

1043
00:58:37,601 --> 00:58:40,687
You ate 15 of them!
These are topical, for the skin.

1044
00:58:40,771 --> 00:58:43,690
I crush them up,
and I put them...

1045
00:58:46,109 --> 00:58:47,319
... for my itching.

1046
00:58:47,402 --> 00:58:49,279
Motherfucker, you got crabs?!

1047
00:58:51,156 --> 00:58:54,326
This man got crabs. You ain't
sittin' in the pilot's seat for sure.

1048
00:58:56,078 --> 00:58:57,996
Ha ha, keep laughing.
It's not funny.

1049
00:58:58,914 --> 00:59:01,124
African crab is very aggressive.

1050
00:59:02,292 --> 00:59:03,460
They hunt us.

1051
00:59:04,545 --> 00:59:06,964
They can kill you.

1052
00:59:07,005 --> 00:59:10,008
That motherfucker
is crazy as fuck, man.

1053
00:59:10,133 --> 00:59:12,010
They dangerous,
and they kill you.

1054
00:59:15,013 --> 00:59:16,765
Fuck!

1055
00:59:16,849 --> 00:59:18,475
That Gaeman!

1056
00:59:21,603 --> 00:59:22,646
Excuse me.

1057
00:59:22,729 --> 00:59:25,482
Motherfucker,
did you just touch me?

1058
00:59:25,566 --> 00:59:27,025
Yeah, I wanna get up
in the club.

1059
00:59:27,109 --> 00:59:29,528
- You on the list?
- What list?

1060
00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:31,405
The goddamn guest list.

1061
00:59:31,488 --> 00:59:33,073
- Are you on it?
- I don't know.

1062
00:59:33,157 --> 00:59:35,159
You don't know?
What's your name?

1063
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,618
Elvis Hunkee.

1064
00:59:37,953 --> 00:59:40,205
I wouldn't even have wrote
no shit down like that, homey.

1065
00:59:40,330 --> 00:59:42,499
Maybe it's under The King,

1066
00:59:42,583 --> 00:59:44,626
'cause my friends,
they call me "The King".

1067
00:59:44,710 --> 00:59:45,711
It's my nickname.

1068
00:59:45,836 --> 00:59:48,213
I ain't your friend,
and you ain't no king, motherfucker.

1069
00:59:48,255 --> 00:59:49,715
Right.

1070
00:59:49,798 --> 00:59:52,968
Move! I'm talkin' to you.

1071
00:59:53,051 --> 00:59:54,761
What's up? Go right in.

1072
01:00:00,893 --> 01:00:03,520
All right, put 'em up.

1073
01:00:03,562 --> 01:00:04,938
It's go time.

1074
01:00:05,022 --> 01:00:07,483
It's definitely go time,
motherfucker.

1075
01:00:07,566 --> 01:00:09,902
You about to get
the best damn ass-whippin'.

1076
01:00:09,985 --> 01:00:12,696
I hope the little bitch
you're lookin' for is worth dyin' for.

1077
01:00:12,821 --> 01:00:15,157
She is, 'cause that little bitch
is my daughter.

1078
01:00:17,743 --> 01:00:18,744
Your daughter?

1079
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:23,832
Why didn't you say
that shit, man?

1080
01:00:23,916 --> 01:00:25,751
I got five daughters, man.

1081
01:00:25,792 --> 01:00:29,379
The little one, Trina,
every time I see her.

1082
01:00:29,421 --> 01:00:33,342
she just runs into my arms,
like, "Daddy. Daddy!"

1083
01:00:33,425 --> 01:00:35,344
We have little tea parties
and shit.

1084
01:00:35,427 --> 01:00:37,596
The little cups, and I put
the little hat on.

1085
01:00:37,679 --> 01:00:41,183
Little table, man.
It was so beautiful.

1086
01:00:41,266 --> 01:00:42,935
My heart would, like, explode.

1087
01:00:43,018 --> 01:00:46,063
Yeah, I need to go upstairs.

1088
01:00:46,188 --> 01:00:48,649
- I miss my babies.
- I miss mine, too. She's upstairs.

1089
01:00:48,774 --> 01:00:51,193
I never see them.
I'm always busy securin' shit.

1090
01:00:51,276 --> 01:00:53,529
- Honest living.
- I never see 'em, dawg.

1091
01:00:53,612 --> 01:00:55,989
Secure your shit.

1092
01:00:57,825 --> 01:01:00,285
Secure your shit.
Go get your girl, man.

1093
01:01:00,410 --> 01:01:01,787
Go get your little girl.

1094
01:01:02,955 --> 01:01:04,456
Take care of your family, man!

1095
01:01:07,459 --> 01:01:08,585
Who's on the list?

1096
01:01:08,627 --> 01:01:11,380
Yo, Captain. I got to go
drain the monster.

1097
01:01:11,463 --> 01:01:13,173
What the hell's taking
Gay-man so long?

1098
01:01:13,257 --> 01:01:14,967
I don't know, I ain't his mama.

1099
01:01:15,050 --> 01:01:16,760
Matter of fact,
why don't you page him

1100
01:01:16,802 --> 01:01:19,638
and tell him to bring
his bitch ass up here 911.

1101
01:01:21,265 --> 01:01:22,391
Attention, Gay-man.

1102
01:01:22,474 --> 01:01:25,310
<i>Attention, Gay-man,
I have to go drain the monster.</i>

1103
01:01:25,394 --> 01:01:27,688
<i>Return to the cockpit
immediately.</i>

1104
01:01:46,832 --> 01:01:49,668
Man, I wouldn't answer
that shit if I was you, homey.

1105
01:01:50,669 --> 01:01:52,838
Shake it up real fast
then stop

1106
01:01:55,340 --> 01:01:57,551
Shake it up real fast
then drop

1107
01:01:59,887 --> 01:02:02,222
Shawty crunk on the floor
wide open

1108
01:02:02,347 --> 01:02:04,766
Skeet so much,
they call her Billy Ocean

1109
01:02:04,808 --> 01:02:06,768
Roll like a 18-wheeler

1110
01:02:06,852 --> 01:02:09,480
That... fine,
but this... killer

1111
01:02:09,521 --> 01:02:11,398
Leakin', she soakin' wet

1112
01:02:13,734 --> 01:02:16,904
- Muggsy, what are you doin'?
- Cut!

1113
01:02:19,406 --> 01:02:20,532
Who the hell said cut?

1114
01:02:20,616 --> 01:02:25,162
Yeah. Who the hell said cut?
The director says cut. Damn!

1115
01:02:25,245 --> 01:02:26,872
Look, Nashawn.
I already know, dawg.

1116
01:02:26,997 --> 01:02:29,666
Come here.
Is that the Ying Yang Twins?

1117
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:31,502
Yeah.

1118
01:02:31,585 --> 01:02:33,504
Watch out.
Ying Yang Twins!

1119
01:02:33,545 --> 01:02:34,713
What's up, baby?

1120
01:02:37,007 --> 01:02:38,592
Don't drink gasoline.
We got a bar.

1121
01:02:38,675 --> 01:02:40,677
I had a gold tooth.
I shoulda kept it for this.

1122
01:02:40,761 --> 01:02:41,762
Why y'all stop rollin'?

1123
01:02:41,845 --> 01:02:42,846
'Cause you came in.

1124
01:02:42,930 --> 01:02:44,890
No, don't stop on account of me,
I'm the owner.

1125
01:02:44,932 --> 01:02:47,392
Nashawn Wade--that's me.
I'm the boss of this.

1126
01:02:47,476 --> 01:02:49,645
- Hey, roll camera!
- Who said roll camera?

1127
01:02:49,728 --> 01:02:52,022
I say roll camera.

1128
01:02:52,064 --> 01:02:53,941
- That's my job.
- That's his job.

1129
01:02:54,024 --> 01:02:57,277
Chris, I'm tellin' ya, we need
more sexy in this video.

1130
01:02:57,361 --> 01:02:58,737
Let's go, Tamika.
Get in there.

1131
01:03:03,742 --> 01:03:04,827
This cool?

1132
01:03:09,498 --> 01:03:12,417
- Yes, sir.
- Tamika, let's get in there.

1133
01:03:12,459 --> 01:03:14,127
Get on in there, girl.

1134
01:03:14,878 --> 01:03:16,171
Yo, Chris, I'm tellin' ya, man.

1135
01:03:16,255 --> 01:03:18,423
We need more ass in this video,
and it'd be off the hook.

1136
01:03:19,424 --> 01:03:21,593
Yo, Muggsy, who is this kid?

1137
01:03:21,677 --> 01:03:23,095
Roll camera.

1138
01:03:30,727 --> 01:03:33,230
- Here you are, sir.
- Thank you.

1139
01:03:39,278 --> 01:03:42,948
Lil' John back there.
Shake it like a salt shaker!

1140
01:03:43,031 --> 01:03:45,784
Can I get a glass of Hypno
with some ice, please?

1141
01:03:45,868 --> 01:03:48,287
- Coming right up.
- What you doin' by yourself?

1142
01:03:48,328 --> 01:03:50,789
- Go have a good time.
- No, thanks.

1143
01:03:50,831 --> 01:03:54,543
- You okay?
- No.

1144
01:03:54,626 --> 01:03:56,712
So what's goin' on?

1145
01:03:56,795 --> 01:04:00,465
My son Billy--he doesn't
want to be anything like me.

1146
01:04:00,591 --> 01:04:02,259
He says I got no flavor.

1147
01:04:02,301 --> 01:04:05,053
My daughter Heather--
she's growin' up so fast.

1148
01:04:05,137 --> 01:04:08,765
It seems like yesterday
I was teachin' her to ride a bike.

1149
01:04:08,891 --> 01:04:10,309
Now she's out there...

1150
01:04:11,685 --> 01:04:12,769
Hey, what is tea-bagging?

1151
01:04:15,481 --> 01:04:16,732
That's the shit!

1152
01:04:16,815 --> 01:04:19,776
That's where you take your balls
and dip 'em in a freak mouth.

1153
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:22,070
you keep goin'
up and down like...

1154
01:04:23,947 --> 01:04:28,076
- Then you dip, right.
- I got it. Thank you.

1155
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:30,329
I got a little carried away.

1156
01:04:30,412 --> 01:04:33,790
Gettin' back on the subject--
you raise your kids right,

1157
01:04:33,832 --> 01:04:35,667
eventually they gonna
wanna move on

1158
01:04:35,751 --> 01:04:37,044
and find they own path.

1159
01:04:37,169 --> 01:04:41,173
You're probably right.
You're a lucky man, Nashawn.

1160
01:04:41,298 --> 01:04:42,799
I wouldn't say that.

1161
01:04:42,883 --> 01:04:45,260
It took me gettin' everything
I ever wanted

1162
01:04:45,344 --> 01:04:47,012
to realize I lost
the best thing I ever had.

1163
01:04:47,095 --> 01:04:48,639
What was her name?

1164
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:51,892
- Giselle.
- That's a beautiful name.

1165
01:04:51,975 --> 01:04:53,435
Bet she's beautiful.

1166
01:04:53,519 --> 01:04:56,313
Very. Very!

1167
01:04:56,355 --> 01:04:57,815
Still love her?

1168
01:04:57,856 --> 01:04:59,358
Course I do.

1169
01:04:59,399 --> 01:05:01,026
Then go do somethin'
about it.

1170
01:05:01,151 --> 01:05:02,861
Listen, when I met
my Barbara.

1171
01:05:02,903 --> 01:05:05,989
I knew that moment I'd move
heaven and earth to be with her.

1172
01:05:06,031 --> 01:05:07,991
I knew that she was worth it.

1173
01:05:08,033 --> 01:05:10,077
So you happy now?

1174
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:11,787
Not really.

1175
01:05:11,870 --> 01:05:15,374
Last time I saw her,
she was with this tall model type.

1176
01:05:16,416 --> 01:05:18,168
A real handsome black guy?

1177
01:05:18,210 --> 01:05:19,211
Yeah.

1178
01:05:19,294 --> 01:05:20,462
Sittin' in low class?

1179
01:05:20,546 --> 01:05:21,839
Yeah.

1180
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:23,465
Got a dick like a fire hose?

1181
01:05:23,549 --> 01:05:25,384
Yeah.

1182
01:05:25,467 --> 01:05:27,928
Yeah, you lost her.

1183
01:05:30,055 --> 01:05:32,432
- Can he get another one?
- Double.

1184
01:05:32,516 --> 01:05:34,393
Have you talked to her?

1185
01:05:34,476 --> 01:05:36,562
She can't talk.
She must have vocal cord damage.

1186
01:05:36,645 --> 01:05:37,646
I can believe it.

1187
01:05:39,940 --> 01:05:44,111
Man, if my baby mama page me
one more time, I swear to God...

1188
01:05:44,236 --> 01:05:46,196
What she want?

1189
01:05:46,238 --> 01:05:48,824
This motherfuckin' bitch wants
some more child support money

1190
01:05:48,907 --> 01:05:50,075
'cause she heard I got this job.

1191
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:51,952
<i>I can't believe these hos
nowadays.</i>

1192
01:05:52,035 --> 01:05:54,454
<i>She extortin' you?
That's messed up, man.</i>

1193
01:05:54,538 --> 01:05:56,206
<i>But you know what?</i>

1194
01:05:56,290 --> 01:05:58,500
<i>If I crash this motherfucker
into a mountain right now,</i>

1195
01:05:58,584 --> 01:06:00,127
<i>the bitch can't get
shit from me.</i>

1196
01:06:00,252 --> 01:06:01,211
Watch this.

1197
01:06:06,633 --> 01:06:08,343
Oh, shit!

1198
01:06:08,427 --> 01:06:13,807
Shit, my nigga!
Oh, shit! Hold on, cuz!

1199
01:06:13,891 --> 01:06:16,185
- Oh, shit!
- Here we go.

1200
01:06:21,356 --> 01:06:23,275
That shit was funny as hell.

1201
01:06:23,358 --> 01:06:25,360
I know they trippin'
off this shit in the back.

1202
01:06:29,072 --> 01:06:32,117
You fuckin' high, dawg.
You startin' to scare me now.

1203
01:06:34,578 --> 01:06:35,746
Here ya go.

1204
01:06:35,787 --> 01:06:38,540
I'm gonna bounce before
Gay-dude and Riggs come back.

1205
01:06:38,624 --> 01:06:40,584
All right, my nigga.

1206
01:06:43,629 --> 01:06:49,426
I'm put this bitch on autopilot
so I can enjoy myself.

1207
01:06:55,224 --> 01:06:57,309
Captain Mack need to kick back

1208
01:06:57,434 --> 01:07:00,479
and enjoy this
motherfuckin' situation.

1209
01:07:00,604 --> 01:07:03,732
Oh, shit.
Last mushroom.

1210
01:07:03,774 --> 01:07:05,859
Might as well go on
and take this to the head.

1211
01:07:08,862 --> 01:07:12,658
Dry-ass mushroom,
African motherfucker.

1212
01:07:33,762 --> 01:07:34,805
Here you are, sir.

1213
01:07:39,434 --> 01:07:42,646
Oh, hey, that's my dad.
I need to talk to him.

1214
01:07:44,982 --> 01:07:45,983
Hi, Daddy.

1215
01:07:47,109 --> 01:07:48,277
Happy birthday, Heather.

1216
01:07:49,862 --> 01:07:51,155
You mad at me?

1217
01:07:51,196 --> 01:07:55,659
No, Actually, I'm just glad to hear
you call me daddy for a change,

1218
01:07:55,701 --> 01:07:56,827
It's been a while,

1219
01:07:56,869 --> 01:07:58,996
Usually it's shithead or asshole
or something,

1220
01:07:59,079 --> 01:08:01,957
I'm sorry. It's just
I hate that you're with Boobra.

1221
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:05,502
Barbara... and I
are not together anymore.

1222
01:08:05,586 --> 01:08:08,547
I'm still upset that
you and Mom aren't together.

1223
01:08:08,630 --> 01:08:10,674
I'm sorry about that, honey.

1224
01:08:11,717 --> 01:08:14,219
But your mom's
with Dorothy now.

1225
01:08:15,554 --> 01:08:17,097
I'd like to be with your mom.

1226
01:08:17,181 --> 01:08:19,641
Hell, I'd love to be
with your mom and Dorothy.

1227
01:08:19,725 --> 01:08:21,518
But that's not important.

1228
01:08:21,602 --> 01:08:23,812
What's important is that you know
that I'm your dad,

1229
01:08:23,896 --> 01:08:26,732
and whether you're 18 or 48 or 88,
I'm gonna still protect you

1230
01:08:26,773 --> 01:08:27,816
because I love you.

1231
01:08:29,693 --> 01:08:30,944
I love you, too, Daddy.

1232
01:08:32,404 --> 01:08:34,490
I'll always be your little girl.

1233
01:08:34,573 --> 01:08:35,574
Right.

1234
01:08:35,657 --> 01:08:36,950
I will.

1235
01:08:37,034 --> 01:08:38,494
What about
all that stuff tonight?

1236
01:08:38,577 --> 01:08:40,746
Oh, don't worry.
I didn't do anything.

1237
01:08:40,829 --> 01:08:42,289
Really?

1238
01:08:42,414 --> 01:08:44,124
I was just saying stuff
to get you mad.

1239
01:08:45,834 --> 01:08:48,337
I don't even know
what half that stuff is.

1240
01:08:48,420 --> 01:08:51,256
What's tea-bagging anyway?

1241
01:08:51,340 --> 01:08:52,966
That's when you
get down on top...

1242
01:08:53,050 --> 01:08:54,384
Dad!

1243
01:08:54,426 --> 01:08:57,513
Apparently, it's the shit.
Come here.

1244
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:04,228
So can I have
another blow job?

1245
01:09:04,269 --> 01:09:06,146
It's a drink.

1246
01:09:08,607 --> 01:09:10,943
It's cool.

1247
01:09:11,026 --> 01:09:14,154
Look, baby. I'm sorry,
and I wants to make it up to you.

1248
01:09:16,448 --> 01:09:19,743
Don't get it started because you
know you're not gonna finish.

1249
01:09:19,785 --> 01:09:23,455
Why you bringin' up old shit?
Let me see them tits!

1250
01:09:26,708 --> 01:09:30,128
Okay, okay! What's the plan?

1251
01:09:31,839 --> 01:09:34,591
Hold on one second.
I'm fixin' to be right back.

1252
01:09:38,345 --> 01:09:42,307
Good evening, Cap.
Is it cool if I come in?

1253
01:09:50,274 --> 01:09:52,442
This is tight up in here, dawg.

1254
01:09:52,526 --> 01:09:54,528
I'm not gonna
beat around the bush, man.

1255
01:09:54,611 --> 01:09:56,155
I'll get straight to the point.

1256
01:09:56,238 --> 01:09:59,950
Me and my girl--we overly ambitious
members of the mile-high club.

1257
01:10:00,033 --> 01:10:03,912
I was wondering if you would
let us come in here,

1258
01:10:03,996 --> 01:10:07,207
and, we could, like, do it.

1259
01:10:08,167 --> 01:10:09,209
All right, cool.

1260
01:10:09,293 --> 01:10:10,294
I'm fixin' to get her.

1261
01:10:10,377 --> 01:10:12,963
You probably gonna see
her titties and everything, man.

1262
01:10:13,088 --> 01:10:14,548
I'll be right back, dawg.

1263
01:10:25,476 --> 01:10:27,811
Hey, this is my girl.

1264
01:10:28,896 --> 01:10:29,980
Hi, Captain.

1265
01:10:31,190 --> 01:10:33,317
I know you got stuff to do,

1266
01:10:33,358 --> 01:10:35,402
so we just gonna
do our thing, man.

1267
01:10:37,321 --> 01:10:39,490
Yeah, it's cool.

1268
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:42,618
Okay, okay.

1269
01:10:42,701 --> 01:10:47,164
No, no.
Ain't that my game.

1270
01:10:53,754 --> 01:10:57,382
Ooh, yeah.
I like the way you doin' that.

1271
01:10:57,466 --> 01:10:58,592
Ooh, work it, daddy.

1272
01:10:58,675 --> 01:11:02,304
I'm tryin', but it's like
a sauna down here,

1273
01:11:02,387 --> 01:11:03,388
It's like a fire,,,

1274
01:11:04,431 --> 01:11:06,892
- How's that?
- Oh, it's good, daddy.

1275
01:11:06,934 --> 01:11:08,685
You the king.

1276
01:11:09,978 --> 01:11:11,980
Tastes like chocolate puddin'.

1277
01:11:13,690 --> 01:11:16,235
Gots to have you right now.

1278
01:11:16,318 --> 01:11:18,862
- Got to have you right now, girl!
- Nasty fool!

1279
01:11:30,582 --> 01:11:33,669
Oh, shit. That nigga dead!
He dead!

1280
01:11:35,963 --> 01:11:37,422
Get your ass off me!

1281
01:11:37,506 --> 01:11:40,259
He's dead! This nigga's dead!

1282
01:11:40,342 --> 01:11:41,468
This nigga's dead!

1283
01:11:45,389 --> 01:11:46,765
The captain is dead!

1284
01:11:48,100 --> 01:11:49,268
Pork chop grease.

1285
01:11:50,644 --> 01:11:53,730
I'll take care of it.
The captain's dead!

1286
01:11:56,984 --> 01:11:59,194
That's our motto:
we fly, we party, we land.

1287
01:11:59,278 --> 01:12:00,904
That's what we tryin'
to do, man.

1288
01:12:00,988 --> 01:12:02,739
Nashawn, we gotta talk.

1289
01:12:02,781 --> 01:12:04,449
I want to talk to you, too.

1290
01:12:05,576 --> 01:12:06,743
The captain is dead.

1291
01:12:06,785 --> 01:12:08,328
Dead?

1292
01:12:09,413 --> 01:12:11,707
Wait a minute.
Are we talkin' Tupac dead.

1293
01:12:11,790 --> 01:12:13,709
Iike maybe he is
or maybe he isn't,

1294
01:12:13,792 --> 01:12:16,461
or Wilt Chamberlain dead, like
he ain't checkin' back in the game?

1295
01:12:16,545 --> 01:12:18,130
Dead like he can't
fly this plane, dead.

1296
01:12:19,756 --> 01:12:21,133
People are freakin' out.

1297
01:12:24,303 --> 01:12:27,306
It's Muggsy
hirin' these prison pilots.

1298
01:12:27,347 --> 01:12:29,516
You know what.
That's what we got a copilot for.

1299
01:12:29,641 --> 01:12:32,060
All we gotta do is find Gaeman,
because I hired him.

1300
01:12:32,144 --> 01:12:34,104
He's a professional,
and we should be cool.

1301
01:12:34,229 --> 01:12:38,192
Yes, counterclockwise.
Move your ass, baby.

1302
01:12:38,275 --> 01:12:40,736
Don't forget to squeeze
my nipple like a cow.

1303
01:12:41,987 --> 01:12:45,616
Would you like to see
my African walking stick?

1304
01:12:45,657 --> 01:12:47,409
Hey, hey, Gaeman.

1305
01:12:47,493 --> 01:12:51,121
Oh, my God. Move over!
How are you, sir?

1306
01:12:51,163 --> 01:12:56,001
I was taking a bath, I was dirty.
You are clean now, ladies.

1307
01:12:56,084 --> 01:12:59,296
I got an emergency,
I need you to fly the plane.

1308
01:12:59,379 --> 01:13:01,006
The plane?

1309
01:13:01,131 --> 01:13:02,090
Yeah.

1310
01:13:02,216 --> 01:13:04,510
- Me? Fly the plane?
- Yes.

1311
01:13:04,593 --> 01:13:06,512
Oh, my God!
I get to fly.

1312
01:13:06,553 --> 01:13:07,513
They will have a parade!

1313
01:13:07,638 --> 01:13:10,057
Go, Gaeman!
Move out the way!

1314
01:13:10,140 --> 01:13:13,143
Move, you bitches!
I have to fly the plane.

1315
01:13:13,185 --> 01:13:14,812
What's wrong with you?

1316
01:13:16,605 --> 01:13:17,689
Oh, shit!

1317
01:13:19,149 --> 01:13:20,609
He fell hard.

1318
01:13:20,692 --> 01:13:22,402
Gaeman!

1319
01:13:27,241 --> 01:13:28,700
God damn!

1320
01:13:29,618 --> 01:13:32,162
What the hell am l
supposed to do now?

1321
01:13:32,287 --> 01:13:35,749
You're gonna find some way
to land this plane.

1322
01:13:35,874 --> 01:13:37,876
Meet me in the cockpit, okay?

1323
01:13:40,712 --> 01:13:43,048
- Meet you?
- In the cockpit.

1324
01:13:55,060 --> 01:13:56,186
I got one more left.

1325
01:13:59,898 --> 01:14:02,609
Here you go. You gotta pull
one of these damn cords.

1326
01:14:02,734 --> 01:14:04,319
I don't want this shit, man.

1327
01:14:04,403 --> 01:14:06,071
I'm responsible
for these people.

1328
01:14:06,196 --> 01:14:07,614
I gotta try something.

1329
01:14:07,698 --> 01:14:09,533
Fuck them.
What are you, sick?

1330
01:14:09,616 --> 01:14:12,870
I know you, all right?
You can't even ride a bike.

1331
01:14:12,953 --> 01:14:14,413
How do you expect
to land this thing?

1332
01:14:14,538 --> 01:14:15,831
It don't even--

1333
01:14:17,583 --> 01:14:18,917
It don't even matter.

1334
01:14:19,001 --> 01:14:20,544
I'm not runnin' out
like I always do.

1335
01:14:20,627 --> 01:14:23,088
I'm gonna face this shit.
If you wanna go, go.

1336
01:14:24,590 --> 01:14:27,050
If you goin', go.
You gotta pull this one.

1337
01:14:27,134 --> 01:14:29,386
Hey, don't be grabbin' my cord.

1338
01:14:29,470 --> 01:14:32,389
You gonna make my chute
ejaculate prematurely,

1339
01:14:37,019 --> 01:14:39,521
Baby, watch your head.
Don't let that touch you.

1340
01:14:39,605 --> 01:14:43,984
- I got a dead pilot, man.
- Just go. God damn!

1341
01:14:44,067 --> 01:14:46,904
Oh, my God!
Not like this.

1342
01:14:51,283 --> 01:14:54,703
Listen, Giselle...
in case something happens,

1343
01:14:54,786 --> 01:14:56,538
there's something I need
to get off my chest.

1344
01:14:56,622 --> 01:14:58,665
That night
when you and I broke up.

1345
01:14:58,749 --> 01:15:00,292
I was on your porch.

1346
01:15:00,417 --> 01:15:04,671
I overheard you and your father
arguing about college.

1347
01:15:04,713 --> 01:15:07,466
What do you mean,
you're not goin' away to college?

1348
01:15:07,549 --> 01:15:10,219
It's too far, I want to stay here
where Nashawn is.

1349
01:15:10,302 --> 01:15:13,764
You gotta go, I been waitin'
18 years for this day

1350
01:15:13,889 --> 01:15:15,224
to have the house to myself.

1351
01:15:15,307 --> 01:15:17,518
I'm not going.

1352
01:15:17,601 --> 01:15:21,063
You always dreamed
of going to NYU.

1353
01:15:22,147 --> 01:15:24,525
Now they're offering you
a full scholarship.

1354
01:15:24,608 --> 01:15:26,151
You tellin' me you're not goin'

1355
01:15:26,235 --> 01:15:28,654
because of some little
poop butt ass nigga

1356
01:15:28,737 --> 01:15:30,155
who can't even keep a job!

1357
01:15:30,239 --> 01:15:33,742
Dad, I'm sorry,
but I can't leave Nashawn.

1358
01:15:33,826 --> 01:15:35,953
I love him and he loves me.

1359
01:15:36,036 --> 01:15:38,997
You are going to college.
You're not messin' up my plans.

1360
01:15:39,081 --> 01:15:42,167
<i>I didn't want you to throw
all that away because of me.</i>

1361
01:15:42,251 --> 01:15:44,253
I can get $200 a month
for that room.

1362
01:15:44,336 --> 01:15:46,797
<i>I just want you to know
that I'm sorry, Giselle.</i>

1363
01:15:46,922 --> 01:15:49,633
<i>- Hey, baby.
- I'm so sorry for hurting you.</i>

1364
01:15:50,592 --> 01:15:53,053
Leaving you was the biggest
mistake of my life.

1365
01:15:54,721 --> 01:15:55,806
For what it's worth...

1366
01:15:58,725 --> 01:16:00,936
I never stopped loving you.

1367
01:16:10,070 --> 01:16:12,156
You better get in there.
You got a plane to land.

1368
01:16:15,450 --> 01:16:17,077
Yeah.

1369
01:16:22,207 --> 01:16:26,128
Cool. I'm cool. I got it.
I got it right now.

1370
01:16:28,463 --> 01:16:29,673
Mayday.

1371
01:16:33,343 --> 01:16:35,095
SOS.

1372
01:16:35,220 --> 01:16:37,097
I said SOS.

1373
01:16:42,978 --> 01:16:44,062
Come down, selecta.

1374
01:16:44,146 --> 01:16:45,230
- Nashawn!
- What?

1375
01:16:45,314 --> 01:16:47,149
Are you gonna cut a demo
or radio in?

1376
01:16:47,232 --> 01:16:48,692
I don't know what to say.

1377
01:16:48,775 --> 01:16:52,029
I got something.
Hello? This is Nashawn Wade,

1378
01:16:52,154 --> 01:16:54,281
owner of NWA Airlines.

1379
01:16:55,324 --> 01:16:56,992
Yes, sir, the black one.

1380
01:16:57,075 --> 01:16:58,869
No, don't hang up. Hello?

1381
01:16:58,911 --> 01:17:01,246
Can you please help us?
We got a situation here.

1382
01:17:01,371 --> 01:17:05,083
My pilot died, and I got people
on the back of my plane

1383
01:17:05,125 --> 01:17:07,711
asking for help and--hello?

1384
01:17:11,340 --> 01:17:13,550
They put me on hold.

1385
01:17:13,592 --> 01:17:17,721
<i>Due to the high number of calls,
your estimated wait time</i>

1386
01:17:17,805 --> 01:17:19,890
<i>- is 45 minutes.
- What are you doing here?</i>

1387
01:17:19,932 --> 01:17:21,266
We family, man.

1388
01:17:21,350 --> 01:17:24,394
We was in this from the beginning,
we gonna ride this out to the end.

1389
01:17:24,478 --> 01:17:25,896
That's my nigga, man.

1390
01:17:27,773 --> 01:17:30,859
Look at my watch.
What's up, G?

1391
01:17:30,943 --> 01:17:33,946
Excuse me. I represent three
of the four white people on board.

1392
01:17:34,029 --> 01:17:36,865
I want to tell you fellas
we are behind you 100%.

1393
01:17:37,991 --> 01:17:39,576
What? Hunkee, please.

1394
01:17:39,660 --> 01:17:41,787
I'm just here to find
the little black box

1395
01:17:41,870 --> 01:17:44,122
so I can wrap
my big, black ass around it.

1396
01:17:44,206 --> 01:17:47,209
If I have to ride that tiny,
indestructible motherfucker

1397
01:17:47,292 --> 01:17:48,836
30,000 feet to safety,

1398
01:17:48,919 --> 01:17:51,839
trust you'll hear bitch screamin'.
"Hi ho, Silver".

1399
01:17:51,922 --> 01:17:53,549
Where's the box?

1400
01:17:53,632 --> 01:17:56,635
I really want to thank y'all
for giving me all this confidence.

1401
01:17:56,718 --> 01:17:59,638
- I really feel it, I do.
- You're welcome.

1402
01:17:59,721 --> 01:18:01,431
Somebody knows
how to land this plane,

1403
01:18:01,515 --> 01:18:02,933
this would be
the time to speak.

1404
01:18:02,975 --> 01:18:05,227
I saw a show on
the Discovery channel,

1405
01:18:05,310 --> 01:18:07,020
but that was about motorcycles.

1406
01:18:17,239 --> 01:18:18,782
Take control of the plane.

1407
01:18:18,824 --> 01:18:19,825
What?

1408
01:18:19,908 --> 01:18:22,703
You have to disengage
the autopilot.

1409
01:18:22,786 --> 01:18:23,829
How do you know that?

1410
01:18:23,912 --> 01:18:26,206
I used to date this pilot,

1411
01:18:26,290 --> 01:18:29,168
and we would make love
in the cockpit.

1412
01:18:29,209 --> 01:18:34,214
You haven't had an orgasm
until you've had it during descent.

1413
01:18:34,339 --> 01:18:37,176
Bitch, can you land this plane?

1414
01:18:37,259 --> 01:18:39,803
Show me where it is, Blanca.
What is it?

1415
01:18:40,929 --> 01:18:42,723
I don't remember.

1416
01:18:42,806 --> 01:18:43,974
That's what I told you...

1417
01:18:44,057 --> 01:18:45,350
I need you to go
to the back then.

1418
01:18:45,434 --> 01:18:46,643
No, hold on.

1419
01:18:46,727 --> 01:18:48,812
Last time I was here...

1420
01:18:57,196 --> 01:18:58,572
Here, here!

1421
01:18:58,655 --> 01:18:59,615
There it is. Push it.

1422
01:18:59,698 --> 01:19:00,657
Somebody help her.

1423
01:19:00,741 --> 01:19:02,326
Okay, I gotta grab it.

1424
01:19:04,661 --> 01:19:06,538
Guess I had a little control
right away.

1425
01:19:06,663 --> 01:19:08,457
I'm flyin', y'all.

1426
01:19:08,540 --> 01:19:11,543
Okay, what's next, Blanca?

1427
01:19:11,627 --> 01:19:12,920
I would...

1428
01:19:16,298 --> 01:19:17,508
Yes, the flaps!

1429
01:19:17,591 --> 01:19:19,176
The flaps!
Adjusting the flaps.

1430
01:19:19,259 --> 01:19:20,719
What's next?

1431
01:19:20,803 --> 01:19:23,472
I think it was... the trim.

1432
01:19:25,724 --> 01:19:27,392
I cannot hear her.

1433
01:19:27,476 --> 01:19:29,895
I got it.
I see what you're sayin'.

1434
01:19:29,937 --> 01:19:31,021
What's next?

1435
01:19:31,063 --> 01:19:34,107
I don't know. This is where
he usually pops the cork.

1436
01:19:34,983 --> 01:19:36,902
We are so fucked!

1437
01:19:36,944 --> 01:19:38,862
Don't panic, please.
You're gonna be okay.

1438
01:19:38,946 --> 01:19:41,240
You can't use that phone
while we're on the plane.

1439
01:19:41,365 --> 01:19:43,033
Girl, please, they say that
to rip you off.

1440
01:19:43,158 --> 01:19:44,618
They want you to use
their phone.

1441
01:19:44,743 --> 01:19:46,662
- I am calling for some help.
- No, I'm telling you.

1442
01:19:46,745 --> 01:19:48,413
Don't be hardheaded.
Don't use that phone.

1443
01:19:48,497 --> 01:19:50,207
Fuck that!

1444
01:20:13,689 --> 01:20:16,608
Okay. All right.
We back on track right now.

1445
01:20:16,692 --> 01:20:18,152
What next, Blanca?

1446
01:20:18,277 --> 01:20:19,903
The wheels.

1447
01:20:21,113 --> 01:20:22,281
Muggsy, pull the wheels down.

1448
01:20:22,364 --> 01:20:23,782
Grab the wheel
and do it slow.

1449
01:20:24,908 --> 01:20:26,368
I feel it comin' down, y'all,

1450
01:20:28,620 --> 01:20:29,663
Oh, yes!

1451
01:20:29,746 --> 01:20:34,168
Oh, D.J., this is it!
It's gonna happen this time, baby.

1452
01:20:34,251 --> 01:20:37,421
We about to die,
you got me tied up down here.

1453
01:20:37,462 --> 01:20:39,214
Damn it, I don't give a fuck.

1454
01:20:39,298 --> 01:20:42,259
We goin' to heaven
with one last nut.

1455
01:20:42,301 --> 01:20:43,635
Nigga, stay focused!

1456
01:20:43,719 --> 01:20:45,721
Yeah! I'm doin' it!

1457
01:20:53,645 --> 01:20:58,567
I told you it was the turbulence.
You don't want none of this.

1458
01:21:05,532 --> 01:21:06,575
Here we go.

1459
01:21:06,658 --> 01:21:08,368
We gonna land.

1460
01:21:21,298 --> 01:21:23,509
New York, here we go!
This is it right here.

1461
01:21:23,634 --> 01:21:24,927
That's the ground!

1462
01:21:44,780 --> 01:21:47,449
We made it.
We gonna live.

1463
01:21:47,533 --> 01:21:49,576
I did it. We down.

1464
01:21:49,660 --> 01:21:54,915
You did it!
That's just what you do, cousin.

1465
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:56,041
Exactly what I do!

1466
01:21:56,166 --> 01:21:59,336
You see what I'm sayin'?
I was so scared.

1467
01:21:59,378 --> 01:22:01,255
You crazy bitch!
Fuck this airline!

1468
01:22:01,380 --> 01:22:05,092
You know what, she was
on the way out anyway.

1469
01:22:05,134 --> 01:22:08,470
- Forget her, baby. You did it.
- I did.

1470
01:22:12,558 --> 01:22:14,351
Yeah, I can do that.

1471
01:22:15,602 --> 01:22:17,563
All right, y'all
with the mushy stuff.

1472
01:22:17,646 --> 01:22:19,606
I'm a go check on
the passengers.

1473
01:22:19,690 --> 01:22:21,859
- Y'all just too cute.
- My boy.

1474
01:22:25,070 --> 01:22:27,531
Maybe we should go, too.
We should check on 'em, too.

1475
01:22:27,614 --> 01:22:29,074
All right. Come on.

1476
01:22:30,242 --> 01:22:32,369
What a day.

1477
01:22:34,079 --> 01:22:37,457
Wait a minute.
Hold that, sugar dumplin'.

1478
01:22:39,084 --> 01:22:40,669
I don't know
what smells better--

1479
01:22:40,752 --> 01:22:44,131
the New York air
or your magnificent perfume.

1480
01:22:44,214 --> 01:22:47,217
Why, thank you.
That's very kind of you.

1481
01:22:48,719 --> 01:22:50,179
Wait a minute.

1482
01:22:53,682 --> 01:22:55,309
That's an Adam's apple.

1483
01:22:55,392 --> 01:22:58,353
I'm a player, but I don't play
that way. Floor walker!

1484
01:22:58,437 --> 01:22:59,646
No, I...

1485
01:22:59,771 --> 01:23:01,690
- Hey, Muggs.
- Yo, cousin.

1486
01:23:01,773 --> 01:23:03,442
That's what I'm talkin' about.
We made it!

1487
01:23:03,567 --> 01:23:06,862
What kind of shit--
this is Central Park.

1488
01:23:06,945 --> 01:23:09,615
Where is Central Park?
It's in New York, ain't it?

1489
01:23:09,698 --> 01:23:11,492
You got JFK, LaGuardia,
Newark--

1490
01:23:11,575 --> 01:23:13,702
What you need an airport for,
you got all this grass?

1491
01:23:13,785 --> 01:23:18,165
Ain't this a bitch?
This nigga is pissin' on the plane!

1492
01:23:18,248 --> 01:23:21,210
That's your problem.
You always thinkin' on the nega--

1493
01:23:22,794 --> 01:23:27,049
Hell, no, I know they didn't
just steal my damn rims.

1494
01:23:27,132 --> 01:23:29,384
That's what your punk ass get.

1495
01:23:29,468 --> 01:23:31,512
You know how hard it is
to get 84-inch rims?

1496
01:23:31,637 --> 01:23:34,097
That's a big-ass tire
for a little-ass plane

1497
01:23:34,181 --> 01:23:35,265
and a short-ass nigga.

1498
01:23:35,390 --> 01:23:37,643
Why don't you go put
a doughnut in your mouth?

1499
01:23:37,726 --> 01:23:39,937
I am going to sue your ass,
I am gonna sue the airline...

1500
01:23:39,978 --> 01:23:41,980
That's all you do is complain.

1501
01:23:42,064 --> 01:23:45,150
It doesn't matter, I'm not
gonna let you spoil this for me.

1502
01:23:45,234 --> 01:23:47,736
I tell you what,
Muggs, take everybody upstairs.

1503
01:23:47,820 --> 01:23:49,446
Drinks on me.
Let's party!

1504
01:23:50,989 --> 01:23:52,866
<i>And we did party.</i>

1505
01:23:52,950 --> 01:23:56,453
<i>Just like I told y'all--
we fly, we party and we land.</i>

1506
01:24:36,618 --> 01:24:38,829
Pop, where'd you get
the moves from?

1507
01:24:38,912 --> 01:24:40,539
Where do ya think
you got 'em from, son?

1508
01:24:58,640 --> 01:25:02,311
Wow! This is the bomb!

1509
01:25:05,814 --> 01:25:09,735
What? What did I say?
Let's dance!
