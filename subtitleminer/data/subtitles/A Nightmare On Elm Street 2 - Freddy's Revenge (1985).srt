1
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,525
OK. Take it easy.

2
00:00:57,564 --> 00:00:58,676
See you.

3
00:01:12,315 --> 00:01:13,591
Turn it down!

4
00:01:38,937 --> 00:01:40,181
I'm serious.

5
00:01:40,217 --> 00:01:42,159
No way! I don't believe it.

6
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,247
No way. You're such a liar.
I can't believe you.

7
00:02:11,288 --> 00:02:13,393
Oh, no. Look behind us.

8
00:02:25,591 --> 00:02:27,020
That one's for you.
He's a live one.

9
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:30,030
He's yours. Here's my stop.

10
00:02:30,614 --> 00:02:31,694
Hey, driver!

11
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:33,076
Hey!

12
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,183
Hey, driver, that was my stop.

13
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,030
Driver, that was my stop!

14
00:02:49,589 --> 00:02:50,833
Driver, what's going on?

15
00:02:50,869 --> 00:02:52,145
Where are we going?

16
00:02:55,893 --> 00:02:57,235
- Driver!
- Where are you going?

17
00:02:57,877 --> 00:02:59,339
Stop it!

18
00:03:09,524 --> 00:03:11,051
Stop!

19
00:03:35,122 --> 00:03:36,551
Please. Please, stop.

20
00:03:38,707 --> 00:03:40,529
What... what is he?

21
00:03:40,562 --> 00:03:41,969
I think he's dead.

22
00:03:42,002 --> 00:03:43,114
Oh, no!

23
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:49,035
Oh, my God!

24
00:03:53,169 --> 00:03:54,544
What's happening?

25
00:04:02,961 --> 00:04:04,848
Oh, my God. We're dead.

26
00:04:23,536 --> 00:04:25,707
Oh, my God! What is it?

27
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:43,949
What's that?

28
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,317
Oh, my God!

29
00:04:46,351 --> 00:04:48,652
Oh, my God! Help me!

30
00:05:01,966 --> 00:05:04,715
Look out, he's coming!
He's coming!

31
00:05:11,757 --> 00:05:13,481
We've got to keep balanced!

32
00:05:41,803 --> 00:05:45,119
Mommy, why can't Jesse wake up
like everybody else?

33
00:05:45,164 --> 00:05:47,051
Oh, honey, he's all right.

34
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:48,993
He's just having a bad dream.

35
00:06:24,169 --> 00:06:26,079
Mmm. Thank you.

36
00:06:27,241 --> 00:06:28,485
Morning, honey.

37
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,764
Hi, Mom.

38
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,037
Well, two more. Hallelujah.

39
00:06:33,576 --> 00:06:35,648
I want that room unpacked
by tonight, young man.

40
00:06:35,689 --> 00:06:37,314
OK, Dad. I promise.

41
00:06:37,353 --> 00:06:39,425
I don't want
any more promises, Jesse.

42
00:06:39,464 --> 00:06:41,351
I want that room cleaned up, OK?

43
00:06:41,384 --> 00:06:43,010
All right. I'll get on it.

44
00:06:46,567 --> 00:06:47,680
Angie, what are you up to?

45
00:06:47,719 --> 00:06:49,606
I'm trying to get
the Fu Man Fingers.

46
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:51,068
Want some eggs?

47
00:06:52,551 --> 00:06:53,631
Jesse, are you OK?

48
00:06:53,672 --> 00:06:56,093
It's just so hot up there.
I'm having trouble sleeping.

49
00:06:56,135 --> 00:06:57,248
I know.

50
00:06:57,287 --> 00:06:59,425
I wish you'd have
the air conditioning...

51
00:06:59,463 --> 00:07:02,561
There's nothing
wrong with it, Mom.

52
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:03,776
It just needs a shot of Freon.

53
00:07:03,815 --> 00:07:04,797
Here they are.

54
00:07:05,735 --> 00:07:07,774
Dad, you're not trying to fix
something again.

55
00:07:08,614 --> 00:07:10,719
Nobody likes a smart ass,
buddy-boy.

56
00:07:10,758 --> 00:07:11,870
Look.

57
00:07:16,774 --> 00:07:17,886
Who is that?

58
00:07:18,982 --> 00:07:20,192
It's Lisa.

59
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,539
I've got to get to school.

60
00:07:21,573 --> 00:07:22,882
Whoa. Who's Lisa?

61
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:26,142
Who is Lisa?

62
00:07:26,853 --> 00:07:28,380
Just eat your eggs, dear.

63
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:43,355
Don't you use a key?

64
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:45,218
Why?

65
00:07:45,253 --> 00:07:46,911
Somebody could steal your car,
couldn't they?

66
00:07:47,748 --> 00:07:49,122
The deadly dinosaur?

67
00:08:10,403 --> 00:08:12,574
Grady, come on. You can hit it!

68
00:08:14,915 --> 00:08:16,802
Let's go, Grady!

69
00:08:16,835 --> 00:08:17,947
Ready, girls?

70
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:27,680
Strike!

71
00:08:28,386 --> 00:08:30,807
It didn't feel right.
Give me a break.

72
00:08:30,849 --> 00:08:32,508
So, you getting any yet, Lise?

73
00:08:32,546 --> 00:08:34,967
Kerry,
he's my ride to school, OK?

74
00:08:46,433 --> 00:08:47,677
Are you all right?

75
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:49,882
You OK?

76
00:08:54,848 --> 00:08:56,058
You OK?

77
00:08:56,097 --> 00:08:57,504
Yeah, I'm fine.

78
00:08:57,536 --> 00:08:59,903
Well, pay attention next time.

79
00:08:59,936 --> 00:09:01,049
Very heads-up play.

80
00:09:01,952 --> 00:09:03,261
Nice catch, Walsh.

81
00:09:03,296 --> 00:09:04,703
Come on, come on! Let's go!

82
00:09:20,671 --> 00:09:21,685
You're out!

83
00:09:22,111 --> 00:09:23,834
Heads-up play, Grady.

84
00:09:23,871 --> 00:09:25,245
All right!

85
00:09:26,655 --> 00:09:27,767
Nice ass.

86
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:29,880
Nail him!

87
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,637
Hit him!

88
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,783
Come on, slug him!

89
00:09:39,197 --> 00:09:41,019
Here comes Schneider. Watch out.

90
00:09:42,141 --> 00:09:43,123
Get out of my way.

91
00:09:44,094 --> 00:09:45,403
Move it!

92
00:09:45,437 --> 00:09:46,998
OK, dirtballs...

93
00:09:48,445 --> 00:09:49,786
assume the position!

94
00:09:59,037 --> 00:10:00,313
See you around, coach.

95
00:10:15,835 --> 00:10:18,137
How much longer do you think
he'll keep us out here?

96
00:10:18,172 --> 00:10:19,415
It could be all night.

97
00:10:20,572 --> 00:10:22,710
He gets his rocks off like this.

98
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,885
Hangs around
queer S and M joints downtown.

99
00:10:26,715 --> 00:10:28,537
He likes pretty boys like you.

100
00:10:28,571 --> 00:10:29,748
Get out of here.

101
00:10:32,891 --> 00:10:34,298
So what about
you and that rich babe...

102
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:36,086
you've been cruising to school
with every day?

103
00:10:36,123 --> 00:10:37,203
What about her?

104
00:10:37,243 --> 00:10:39,479
Are you mounting her nightly
or what?

105
00:10:39,515 --> 00:10:41,457
Look, Grady,
you got some problem with me?

106
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:44,629
No, bro. Just killing time.

107
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:49,527
OK, dirtballs, hit the shower!

108
00:10:56,729 --> 00:10:58,136
So you live around here or what?

109
00:10:58,329 --> 00:11:00,533
Yeah. My parents bought a place
on Elm Street.

110
00:11:00,569 --> 00:11:01,551
Elm Street?

111
00:11:02,169 --> 00:11:03,576
You telling me you moved
into that big white house...

112
00:11:03,609 --> 00:11:05,333
with bars on the window?

113
00:11:05,369 --> 00:11:06,613
Yeah. What about it?

114
00:11:06,649 --> 00:11:09,464
Shit. Tell your old man
he's a real chump.

115
00:11:09,496 --> 00:11:11,220
What are you talking about now?

116
00:11:11,928 --> 00:11:14,579
Some chick was locked in there
by her mother and went crazy.

117
00:11:15,737 --> 00:11:17,329
She watched her boyfriend get
butchered across the street...

118
00:11:17,368 --> 00:11:18,961
by some maniac.

119
00:11:20,728 --> 00:11:22,288
You're full of shit, Grady.

120
00:11:53,014 --> 00:11:54,127
Shit.

121
00:14:10,191 --> 00:14:11,401
Help!

122
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,721
Daddy can't help you now!

123
00:14:24,942 --> 00:14:27,756
I need you, Jesse.

124
00:14:27,789 --> 00:14:31,433
We got special work to do here,
you and me.

125
00:14:35,724 --> 00:14:37,383
You've got the body...

126
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:41,154
I've got the brain.

127
00:14:59,019 --> 00:15:00,426
You think
we should call a doctor?

128
00:15:01,676 --> 00:15:03,301
No, I'm fine.

129
00:15:03,339 --> 00:15:06,056
It's just a bad dream, OK?

130
00:15:08,523 --> 00:15:10,279
Yeah. Go to sleep.

131
00:15:13,899 --> 00:15:15,109
So...

132
00:15:15,754 --> 00:15:17,216
to review...

133
00:15:17,258 --> 00:15:18,687
the solid waste...

134
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:21,697
those nutrients not absorbed
in the lining of the stomach...

135
00:15:21,739 --> 00:15:23,233
the large intestine...

136
00:15:23,274 --> 00:15:25,729
the small intestine,
and the alimentary canal...

137
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:27,461
are passed out
through the colon.

138
00:15:30,953 --> 00:15:32,514
Liquid nutrients
are then carried...

139
00:15:32,554 --> 00:15:34,441
through an elaborate system
of filtering...

140
00:15:34,474 --> 00:15:37,474
aided by the pancreas,
liver, and gall bladder...

141
00:15:38,345 --> 00:15:41,694
or collected in the bladder
to be expelled at a later time.

142
00:15:43,305 --> 00:15:45,542
And this entire process
is kept moving...

143
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:47,716
through
the circulatory system...

144
00:15:47,753 --> 00:15:49,346
the center of which is...

145
00:15:52,232 --> 00:15:54,054
the heart.

146
00:15:57,416 --> 00:16:00,612
Four chambers... just like
the human heart, really.

147
00:16:02,088 --> 00:16:03,648
From the body...

148
00:16:03,687 --> 00:16:04,997
to the right auricle...

149
00:16:05,032 --> 00:16:06,177
to the right ventricle...

150
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:08,070
and out the pulmonary
arteries to the lungs.

151
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:12,511
There it trades off
carbon dioxide for oxygen.

152
00:16:12,551 --> 00:16:14,755
Carbon dioxide is exhaled...

153
00:16:14,792 --> 00:16:19,014
and oxygenated blood continues
passing through the veins...

154
00:16:19,047 --> 00:16:21,348
into the left auricle...

155
00:16:21,383 --> 00:16:23,870
through the left ventricle,
passing out again.

156
00:16:54,277 --> 00:16:55,968
If you want to play
with animals, Mr. Walsh...

157
00:16:56,005 --> 00:16:57,914
join the circus.

158
00:17:16,803 --> 00:17:18,210
Lisa, sweetheart!

159
00:17:18,948 --> 00:17:20,770
There's a Jesse on the phone.

160
00:17:20,803 --> 00:17:22,461
OK. Thanks, Mom.

161
00:17:39,586 --> 00:17:40,731
Where are you going, Jess?

162
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:42,232
Just out for a little while.

163
00:17:42,274 --> 00:17:44,860
I told you
I want that room unpacked.

164
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:46,108
Dad, it's just for a few hours.

165
00:17:46,146 --> 00:17:48,534
No. Upstairs.

166
00:17:48,578 --> 00:17:50,236
Right now, son.

167
00:17:50,274 --> 00:17:51,386
Right now.

168
00:18:23,904 --> 00:18:25,529
How do you like that, Dad?

169
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:20,632
I'll leave the two of you alone.

170
00:19:20,668 --> 00:19:21,780
Excuse me.

171
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:29,332
I told her you invited me over.

172
00:19:30,076 --> 00:19:31,864
I guess maybe
I should've called.

173
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:34,899
It's fine, really.

174
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,241
I mean,
I was just cleaning my room.

175
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:38,388
I know.

176
00:19:39,067 --> 00:19:41,271
I figured
you might like some help.

177
00:19:48,667 --> 00:19:50,041
Where does this go?

178
00:19:54,363 --> 00:19:55,573
Do sweaters go in the closet?

179
00:20:08,538 --> 00:20:09,999
What's this?

180
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:12,016
I don't know.
Looks like a diary to me.

181
00:20:19,001 --> 00:20:22,165
"Nancy Thompson,
1428 Elm Street."

182
00:20:22,201 --> 00:20:23,379
That's right here.

183
00:20:25,785 --> 00:20:27,924
You know this is five years old?

184
00:20:27,961 --> 00:20:29,368
You know her?

185
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,637
No. Before my time.

186
00:20:34,104 --> 00:20:35,479
Wait. Listen to this.

187
00:20:35,512 --> 00:20:38,000
"Sometimes
when I'm lying here in bed...

188
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,276
"I see Glenn in his window
across the way...

189
00:20:40,312 --> 00:20:42,199
"getting ready for bed.

190
00:20:42,232 --> 00:20:44,119
"His body is slim and smooth.

191
00:20:44,152 --> 00:20:46,257
"I know I shouldn't watch him...

192
00:20:46,296 --> 00:20:48,565
"but that part of me
that wants him...

193
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:50,126
"forces me to."

194
00:20:51,096 --> 00:20:52,502
"That's when I weaken.

195
00:20:52,535 --> 00:20:54,477
"That's when
I want to go to him."

196
00:20:57,111 --> 00:20:58,224
Can I see that?

197
00:21:01,527 --> 00:21:03,250
"March Fifteenth."

198
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:05,550
"He comes to me at night...

199
00:21:05,591 --> 00:21:08,525
"horrible, ugly, and dirty...

200
00:21:08,566 --> 00:21:10,093
"under the sheets with me...

201
00:21:10,134 --> 00:21:13,582
"tearing at my nightgown
with his steel claws."

202
00:21:17,014 --> 00:21:19,087
"His name is Fred...

203
00:21:19,126 --> 00:21:21,231
"and he keeps trying to take me
to the boiler room."

204
00:21:23,093 --> 00:21:24,849
"He wants to kill me."

205
00:21:30,645 --> 00:21:32,205
What is it?

206
00:21:35,893 --> 00:21:37,354
"Tina is dead"?

207
00:21:41,684 --> 00:21:43,091
Jesse, are you OK?

208
00:21:45,044 --> 00:21:47,084
It's just something
that Grady said to me...

209
00:21:48,756 --> 00:21:50,512
about the girl
that used to live here.

210
00:21:50,548 --> 00:21:51,977
How she went crazy...

211
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,769
when she saw her boyfriend
get murdered across the street.

212
00:24:38,859 --> 00:24:40,036
Go ahead, Jesse.

213
00:24:40,938 --> 00:24:42,279
Try it on for size.

214
00:24:51,242 --> 00:24:52,354
Kill for me.

215
00:25:12,713 --> 00:25:14,655
It was
like I was sleepwalking.

216
00:25:14,696 --> 00:25:16,638
Maybe you were having
a premonition or something...

217
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,168
like the guys
who help police solve crimes...

218
00:25:19,208 --> 00:25:21,095
and find missing people.

219
00:25:21,128 --> 00:25:22,786
You ever have anything like this
happen before?

220
00:25:22,823 --> 00:25:23,936
No, never.

221
00:25:23,976 --> 00:25:25,667
You think that's what it is?

222
00:25:25,703 --> 00:25:26,816
I don't know.

223
00:25:27,847 --> 00:25:29,506
Can I see the diary
for a little while?

224
00:25:30,823 --> 00:25:31,903
Thanks.

225
00:25:31,943 --> 00:25:34,365
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, Kerry.

226
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:36,611
I got your invitation
for the party this weekend.

227
00:25:37,415 --> 00:25:38,942
Any cute guys gonna be there?

228
00:25:38,983 --> 00:25:40,544
All of them.

229
00:25:40,583 --> 00:25:42,819
Is your dad
gonna be the D.J. again?

230
00:25:43,815 --> 00:25:45,375
Mom's gonna try to keep him
upstairs this time.

231
00:25:45,414 --> 00:25:46,527
Oh, good.

232
00:25:47,686 --> 00:25:48,930
Last party I had...

233
00:25:48,966 --> 00:25:52,414
my dad insisted on playing
Benny Goodman all night.

234
00:25:53,958 --> 00:25:55,551
I'll see you later, OK?

235
00:26:08,742 --> 00:26:11,425
Hey, Grady,
do you remember your dreams?

236
00:26:11,461 --> 00:26:13,119
Only the wet ones.

237
00:26:13,157 --> 00:26:14,269
No talking!

238
00:26:21,317 --> 00:26:24,066
Schneider shouldn't have called
you out on that last play.

239
00:26:25,572 --> 00:26:27,459
Schneider's
got a stick up his ass today.

240
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,878
Schneider's
always got a stick up his ass.

241
00:26:30,916 --> 00:26:32,574
Hello, dirtballs.

242
00:26:55,554 --> 00:26:58,456
Oh, it is so hot in here!

243
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:02,520
Let me look at the thermostat.

244
00:27:11,105 --> 00:27:13,756
My God,
it is hot as an oven in here.

245
00:27:13,793 --> 00:27:16,924
Shh! The birds are sleeping.

246
00:27:18,114 --> 00:27:20,983
Cheryl, it's
ninety-seven degrees in here.

247
00:27:39,744 --> 00:27:40,889
Damn it!

248
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,738
Angela, watch out!

249
00:27:46,144 --> 00:27:47,453
Watch out, Jesse!

250
00:27:50,207 --> 00:27:51,767
Ken, are you all right?

251
00:27:51,808 --> 00:27:52,887
Damn bird!

252
00:27:52,927 --> 00:27:54,814
Look out, Angela! Get down!

253
00:27:59,487 --> 00:28:01,527
Look out, Angela!

254
00:28:04,127 --> 00:28:05,949
Jesse, get out of here!

255
00:28:30,269 --> 00:28:31,959
What are you doing, Jesse?
Help me move this.

256
00:28:31,997 --> 00:28:33,622
It isn't the gas.

257
00:28:33,661 --> 00:28:35,067
Don't tell me it's not the gas.

258
00:28:35,101 --> 00:28:37,043
Your mother thought
she smelled gas.

259
00:28:37,084 --> 00:28:38,906
Ken, I thought I did.
I wasn't sure.

260
00:28:38,941 --> 00:28:40,883
Then what is it? Bird rabies?

261
00:28:40,924 --> 00:28:42,517
It's that cheap seed
you've been buying.

262
00:28:42,556 --> 00:28:44,279
Please, Ken, really...

263
00:28:44,316 --> 00:28:46,104
There's gotta be
a rational explanation.

264
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:48,344
Animals don't just explode
into flames for no reason.

265
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,460
That's right.

266
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,645
All right.

267
00:28:50,684 --> 00:28:52,210
It's sure not a leaky gas pipe.

268
00:28:54,588 --> 00:28:55,929
- You all right?
- Oh, it's all right.

269
00:28:56,859 --> 00:28:59,096
You set this whole thing up,
didn't you?

270
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:01,619
What are you talking about?

271
00:29:01,659 --> 00:29:03,481
You know damn well
what I'm talking about.

272
00:29:03,515 --> 00:29:05,784
What did you use, firecrackers?

273
00:29:05,819 --> 00:29:07,641
He used a goddamn cherry bomb.

274
00:29:07,675 --> 00:29:08,787
- Oh, stop.
- That's what he did.

275
00:29:08,827 --> 00:29:10,583
You can't talk to me like that.

276
00:29:10,619 --> 00:29:11,993
Jesse, come back here.

277
00:29:12,027 --> 00:29:13,587
Come back here, Jesse!

278
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:15,033
Ken, stop it!
You're being ridiculous!

279
00:29:15,067 --> 00:29:16,408
Stop it!

280
00:29:28,506 --> 00:29:29,935
Shit.

281
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:37,004
Jesus, I don't know.
He does the strangest things.

282
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,146
Can I have a beer, please?

283
00:32:06,449 --> 00:32:07,856
Hit the shower.

284
00:34:24,232 --> 00:34:25,345
No, God damn it!

285
00:35:44,196 --> 00:35:45,374
Oh, boy.

286
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:50,017
Good evening.
Does this belong to you?

287
00:35:50,052 --> 00:35:52,223
Yes, sir. He's my son.

288
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:54,561
We found him on the highway
wandering around.

289
00:35:54,596 --> 00:35:56,483
He was naked.

290
00:35:57,603 --> 00:36:00,221
I'd keep a short leash on him
if I were you.

291
00:36:00,259 --> 00:36:01,339
Thank you.

292
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,721
Jesse, come in. Come in.

293
00:36:07,267 --> 00:36:08,412
Come here.

294
00:36:10,147 --> 00:36:11,837
Two questions...

295
00:36:13,026 --> 00:36:15,415
you answer them,
and we can all go to bed.

296
00:36:20,194 --> 00:36:21,536
What are you taking, son?

297
00:36:22,658 --> 00:36:23,999
Who are you getting it from?

298
00:36:26,306 --> 00:36:28,477
I'm not taking drugs.

299
00:36:30,497 --> 00:36:31,675
Mom, I want to go to bed.

300
00:36:31,713 --> 00:36:32,891
Yeah, come on.

301
00:36:45,825 --> 00:36:47,483
It's a problem
I have to work out on my own.

302
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,276
I know,
but something's bothering you.

303
00:36:49,313 --> 00:36:51,167
I'm concerned about you. Jesse!

304
00:36:51,201 --> 00:36:53,437
I'm fine. Just leave me alone.

305
00:36:54,177 --> 00:36:55,583
Can't we at least talk about it?

306
00:37:07,552 --> 00:37:08,795
He needs professional help.

307
00:37:08,832 --> 00:37:11,003
We have to take him to see
a psychiatrist.

308
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:13,494
Are you out of your gourd?
What the hell will that do?

309
00:37:13,535 --> 00:37:16,534
I don't know. He needs help
we can't give to him.

310
00:37:16,575 --> 00:37:17,981
Oh, come on.

311
00:37:18,015 --> 00:37:20,436
Are you hearing me?
That boy's in trouble!

312
00:37:20,479 --> 00:37:21,908
No, he's not in trouble!

313
00:37:22,879 --> 00:37:24,766
What that boy needs
is a goddamn kick in the butt.

314
00:37:24,799 --> 00:37:25,911
That's what he needs!

315
00:37:27,806 --> 00:37:30,359
Tell you what he needs.
He needs a methadone clinic.

316
00:37:48,093 --> 00:37:49,238
What's happening?

317
00:37:50,653 --> 00:37:52,660
I want all you students
to step back here.

318
00:37:57,789 --> 00:37:59,131
Don't worry.

319
00:37:59,164 --> 00:38:00,691
Let them do their work,
all right?

320
00:38:00,732 --> 00:38:02,292
Yo, man, where have you been?

321
00:38:02,333 --> 00:38:03,893
Schneider got wasted last night.

322
00:38:03,932 --> 00:38:05,493
He must've been working late.

323
00:38:05,532 --> 00:38:07,419
Some maniac sliced him up
like a kielbasa...

324
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:08,532
hacked him in the shower.

325
00:38:08,572 --> 00:38:10,427
Got bloody footprints
all over the place.

326
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:50,643
Kill for me.

327
00:39:12,249 --> 00:39:15,347
One, two

328
00:39:15,384 --> 00:39:19,824
Freddy's coming for you

329
00:39:20,503 --> 00:39:22,707
Three

330
00:39:22,744 --> 00:39:24,304
Four

331
00:39:24,343 --> 00:39:29,428
Better lock your door

332
00:39:30,392 --> 00:39:32,301
Five

333
00:39:32,343 --> 00:39:33,587
Six

334
00:39:33,623 --> 00:39:37,682
Grab your crucifix

335
00:39:42,199 --> 00:39:43,540
Morning, Jess.

336
00:39:43,575 --> 00:39:44,687
Morning.

337
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:57,586
How come it took them five years
to sell this house?

338
00:39:57,622 --> 00:40:00,404
Oh, I don't know.
Couldn't get the right price.

339
00:40:00,438 --> 00:40:02,859
You didn't know about the murder
across the street...

340
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:04,145
and the crazy girl
that lived here...

341
00:40:04,181 --> 00:40:05,588
that saw the whole thing?

342
00:40:05,621 --> 00:40:07,563
They told me something about it.

343
00:40:07,605 --> 00:40:09,263
You knew something
about this, and...

344
00:40:10,261 --> 00:40:12,912
How do you think
we got such a good deal?

345
00:40:14,004 --> 00:40:16,939
Did they tell you
that that girl lost her mind...

346
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:19,217
and her mother killed herself
in our living room?

347
00:40:19,253 --> 00:40:21,041
- What?
- Did they tell you that?

348
00:40:21,076 --> 00:40:23,280
Mom, I'm scared.

349
00:40:23,316 --> 00:40:24,396
Come here.

350
00:40:24,436 --> 00:40:25,680
Oh, honey, it's all right.

351
00:40:25,716 --> 00:40:28,171
Daddy and Jesse
are just pretending.

352
00:40:28,212 --> 00:40:29,902
We shouldn't discuss this here.

353
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:31,117
See what you're doing?

354
00:40:31,156 --> 00:40:32,683
I don't want to hear
one more word about it.

355
00:40:32,724 --> 00:40:35,920
There's absolutely nothing wrong
with this house.

356
00:40:35,956 --> 00:40:37,068
Come on.

357
00:40:38,003 --> 00:40:39,312
Is something burning?

358
00:40:43,219 --> 00:40:44,364
Good Lord!

359
00:40:54,163 --> 00:40:56,683
That's the craziest damn thing
I've ever seen.

360
00:40:58,130 --> 00:40:59,243
Look here, Cheryl.

361
00:41:00,434 --> 00:41:01,710
It wasn't even plugged in.

362
00:41:06,226 --> 00:41:10,000
Jesse, you can't blame yourself
for what happened to Schneider.

363
00:41:10,033 --> 00:41:12,008
Just because you dreamt it
doesn't mean you did it.

364
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:13,130
Where are we going?

365
00:41:13,169 --> 00:41:14,281
Bear left over here.

366
00:41:17,489 --> 00:41:20,391
I really think
this is all in your mind.

367
00:41:20,433 --> 00:41:22,767
You're picking up
some psychic signals.

368
00:41:46,896 --> 00:41:48,106
What is this place?

369
00:41:50,607 --> 00:41:52,068
Do you remember in the diary...

370
00:41:52,111 --> 00:41:54,446
when Nancy said she kept finding
herself in a boiler room?

371
00:41:54,479 --> 00:41:56,813
Fred Krueger worked here.

372
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:58,276
It's an old power plant.

373
00:42:00,718 --> 00:42:01,831
Here.

374
00:42:02,671 --> 00:42:03,849
What is all this?

375
00:42:03,887 --> 00:42:06,604
I did some reading
on our friend Fred Krueger.

376
00:42:24,589 --> 00:42:26,084
How long has it been
closed down?

377
00:42:26,125 --> 00:42:27,848
A long time. Come on.

378
00:42:32,909 --> 00:42:35,014
Fred Krueger
kidnapped twenty kids...

379
00:42:35,053 --> 00:42:36,711
and brought them here...

380
00:42:36,748 --> 00:42:38,057
and killed them.

381
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:47,333
Do you feel anything?

382
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:49,380
What do you mean?

383
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:52,387
I thought you might be able to
make a connection or something.

384
00:43:01,099 --> 00:43:02,506
I feel like a jerk.

385
00:43:02,539 --> 00:43:04,066
Shh. Just concentrate.

386
00:43:12,874 --> 00:43:14,565
Do you feel anything?

387
00:44:40,038 --> 00:44:42,525
Wake up, little girl.

388
00:44:46,693 --> 00:44:48,220
What time is it?

389
00:44:53,893 --> 00:44:55,038
It's late.

390
00:44:56,325 --> 00:44:57,918
Go back to sleep.

391
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:24,669
Morning, honey.

392
00:45:24,707 --> 00:45:25,820
Did you sleep OK?

393
00:45:26,755 --> 00:45:28,543
Yeah, fine.

394
00:45:28,579 --> 00:45:29,658
Good.

395
00:45:29,699 --> 00:45:31,008
You're looking better.

396
00:45:41,698 --> 00:45:43,520
You had another nightmare,
didn't you?

397
00:45:44,386 --> 00:45:46,458
Yes, I had a bad night.

398
00:45:46,497 --> 00:45:47,926
Do you want to talk about it?

399
00:45:50,018 --> 00:45:52,156
My dad thinks I'm on drugs.

400
00:45:52,194 --> 00:45:53,600
My mom thinks I'm crazy.

401
00:45:53,633 --> 00:45:54,713
And you know, at this point...

402
00:45:54,753 --> 00:45:56,444
I don't know
if I don't agree with her.

403
00:46:00,353 --> 00:46:02,808
What's wrong with Jesse?
He seems kind of freaked out.

404
00:46:07,616 --> 00:46:09,885
You want to go get a movie
or something, hang out?

405
00:46:09,921 --> 00:46:12,703
Maybe get things off your mind,
get a pizza or something?

406
00:46:12,736 --> 00:46:13,849
Hey, guys.

407
00:46:16,288 --> 00:46:17,401
Hi, Ronnie.

408
00:46:19,168 --> 00:46:20,542
You going to Lisa's house
tomorrow night?

409
00:46:20,576 --> 00:46:22,518
Nope. Can't. I'm grounded.

410
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:23,672
How come?

411
00:46:24,351 --> 00:46:26,718
I threw my grandmother
down a flight of stairs.

412
00:46:29,663 --> 00:46:31,386
Jesse, I think
you should eat something.

413
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:32,535
I'm not hungry.

414
00:46:32,575 --> 00:46:34,614
I wish you would talk to me.

415
00:46:34,655 --> 00:46:35,931
We can figure it out.

416
00:46:35,967 --> 00:46:37,755
We can figure it out together.

417
00:46:37,791 --> 00:46:39,798
There is nothing to figure out.

418
00:46:40,703 --> 00:46:41,913
I don't know
why you're wasting your time.

419
00:46:41,951 --> 00:46:44,667
- He's a basket case.
- Shut up, Grady!

420
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:48,157
You want me to shut up?

421
00:46:48,190 --> 00:46:50,459
Fine! I'll shut up. No problem.

422
00:46:51,230 --> 00:46:52,506
See you around, buddy.

423
00:47:07,486 --> 00:47:08,914
Medium rare.

424
00:47:27,356 --> 00:47:29,079
Hey! Cut that out.

425
00:47:30,044 --> 00:47:31,156
I've got it.

426
00:47:33,692 --> 00:47:35,797
Sweetheart, it's a nice party.

427
00:47:35,835 --> 00:47:37,907
Come on, skinny.
It's time for bed.

428
00:47:40,155 --> 00:47:41,716
You're in charge, hot shot.

429
00:47:44,443 --> 00:47:47,290
Twelve-thirty, miss. No later.

430
00:47:47,323 --> 00:47:49,297
- Twelve-thirty.
- Have a nice time.

431
00:47:58,682 --> 00:48:00,242
What's the matter with Jesse?

432
00:48:01,082 --> 00:48:02,195
I don't know.

433
00:48:11,130 --> 00:48:12,242
I'll be out in a second.

434
00:48:12,281 --> 00:48:14,670
Can I please come in
and talk to you?

435
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:31,121
Listen, I'm going to leave.
I'm not into this.

436
00:48:32,568 --> 00:48:33,778
I'm sorry.

437
00:48:34,776 --> 00:48:36,915
Jesse, why won't you talk to me?

438
00:48:39,895 --> 00:48:42,284
- Will you just leave me alone?
- You're not being fair.

439
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:44,789
I want to help you.

440
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:47,283
How can you help me?

441
00:48:48,728 --> 00:48:50,288
What are you gonna do for me?

442
00:48:50,327 --> 00:48:53,361
Look, I feel like
I'm losing my mind...

443
00:48:54,871 --> 00:48:56,758
and I don't want you to watch me
fall apart.

444
00:48:57,879 --> 00:49:00,399
I'm afraid to go to sleep.

445
00:49:01,526 --> 00:49:03,184
I'm afraid to stay awake.

446
00:49:03,223 --> 00:49:05,678
I'm ruining your party.

447
00:49:05,718 --> 00:49:07,027
They're gonna take me away.

448
00:49:07,062 --> 00:49:08,885
Come on. Don't say that.

449
00:49:08,918 --> 00:49:11,220
Listen, we'll stay up all night
if we have to.

450
00:49:11,254 --> 00:49:13,807
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you.

451
00:49:48,788 --> 00:49:50,860
Any second now. Any second now.

452
00:50:05,907 --> 00:50:07,019
Party time!

453
00:50:08,915 --> 00:50:10,028
I got the music!

454
00:50:26,257 --> 00:50:27,850
What the hell
are they doing down there?

455
00:50:27,890 --> 00:50:29,166
Oh, Eddie, they're kids.

456
00:50:29,202 --> 00:50:32,365
I know they're kids,
but I got to get some rest.

457
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:24,548
What is it?

458
00:51:26,638 --> 00:51:28,132
Jesse, what's wrong?

459
00:51:43,981 --> 00:51:45,475
Jesus Christ!

460
00:51:45,517 --> 00:51:47,207
You scared
the shit out of me, man.

461
00:51:47,917 --> 00:51:49,924
Hey, what are you doing?

462
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:56,103
Hey, what the fuck
are you doing in my room?

463
00:51:57,004 --> 00:51:58,084
Listen...

464
00:51:58,125 --> 00:51:59,434
I'm in trouble.

465
00:52:00,428 --> 00:52:02,217
I need you to let me
stay here tonight.

466
00:52:02,252 --> 00:52:03,877
Are you out of your mind?

467
00:52:04,748 --> 00:52:06,177
I don't know.

468
00:52:07,372 --> 00:52:08,484
Oh, man.

469
00:52:12,268 --> 00:52:14,504
Why don't you just go home and
take a bottle of sleeping pills?

470
00:52:17,099 --> 00:52:18,561
I killed Schneider.

471
00:52:19,723 --> 00:52:21,316
You what?

472
00:52:21,355 --> 00:52:22,849
Only it wasn't me, see?

473
00:52:23,659 --> 00:52:25,448
There's something inside of me.

474
00:52:25,482 --> 00:52:28,297
And last night it made me go
to my sister's room.

475
00:52:28,331 --> 00:52:30,218
And tonight,
with Lisa in the cabana...

476
00:52:30,251 --> 00:52:32,290
it started to happen again.

477
00:52:32,331 --> 00:52:35,014
I think you are seriously
losing it, bro.

478
00:52:35,050 --> 00:52:36,806
I'm scared, Grady.

479
00:52:38,411 --> 00:52:40,799
Something is trying
to get inside my body.

480
00:52:40,842 --> 00:52:43,111
She's female and waiting for
you in the cabana.

481
00:52:43,146 --> 00:52:44,575
And you wanna sleep with me.

482
00:52:44,618 --> 00:52:47,880
Look, I don't care
if you believe me or not!

483
00:52:47,913 --> 00:52:49,342
Hey! I believe you!

484
00:52:49,385 --> 00:52:51,719
You've had
some scary dreams, OK?

485
00:52:57,993 --> 00:53:00,742
I don't... know.

486
00:53:02,216 --> 00:53:03,623
I'm all messed up.

487
00:53:05,033 --> 00:53:06,527
What difference does it make?

488
00:53:07,624 --> 00:53:09,184
I'm in trouble...

489
00:53:09,225 --> 00:53:11,134
and I need you to help me.

490
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:29,607
All right, man.
What do you want me to do?

491
00:53:34,855 --> 00:53:36,131
Just watch me.

492
00:53:37,799 --> 00:53:39,871
If anything starts to happen...

493
00:53:40,839 --> 00:53:42,562
if I start to act weird...

494
00:53:42,598 --> 00:53:44,573
or start dreaming weird...

495
00:53:44,614 --> 00:53:46,272
or try to walk out of here...

496
00:53:46,311 --> 00:53:47,772
you gotta stop me.

497
00:53:47,814 --> 00:53:49,756
I don't care if you have
to hit me over the head...

498
00:53:49,798 --> 00:53:51,587
just don't let me leave.

499
00:53:51,622 --> 00:53:52,735
And, Grady...

500
00:53:54,598 --> 00:53:56,224
don't fall asleep.

501
00:53:58,630 --> 00:53:59,742
Hot dog?

502
00:54:03,877 --> 00:54:05,154
Come back in the water.

503
00:54:05,925 --> 00:54:07,332
I'm busy, OK?

504
00:54:10,437 --> 00:54:12,324
I don't know.
I feel I should go see him...

505
00:54:12,357 --> 00:54:14,560
but I can't
just leave the party.

506
00:54:14,597 --> 00:54:16,669
Fuck the party.

507
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:19,225
Go see him.

508
00:54:27,972 --> 00:54:30,012
The land of the dead...

509
00:54:30,052 --> 00:54:31,808
I want youse to meet Lou...

510
00:54:31,843 --> 00:54:34,810
And now I see the...

511
00:54:34,852 --> 00:54:35,931
Gee, kid, you're a doll.

512
00:54:35,972 --> 00:54:37,182
You sure handled
that situation...

513
00:54:39,395 --> 00:54:42,046
Was he alive? That funnels
into a bottomless pit!

514
00:54:51,298 --> 00:54:52,825
Sweet dreams, pal.

515
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:11,961
What?

516
00:55:13,889 --> 00:55:15,744
It's starting to happen again.

517
00:55:24,513 --> 00:55:25,625
Jesus.

518
00:55:26,433 --> 00:55:27,545
Hey, man.

519
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:32,251
What the fuck's
wrong with you, dude?

520
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:46,711
Shit.

521
00:56:09,022 --> 00:56:10,135
Dad, open the door!

522
00:56:43,132 --> 00:56:44,081
Oh, my God!

523
00:56:45,596 --> 00:56:47,287
Dad, open this door!

524
00:57:04,603 --> 00:57:05,715
What is it?

525
00:57:09,947 --> 00:57:11,473
Ron, open the door!

526
00:57:11,514 --> 00:57:13,238
Ron, are you all right?

527
00:57:17,114 --> 00:57:19,383
Ron, it's your father!
Open this door!

528
00:57:28,442 --> 00:57:29,619
Open it up!

529
00:57:36,569 --> 00:57:37,998
Get help!

530
00:58:13,015 --> 00:58:15,437
You son of a bitch!

531
00:58:16,407 --> 00:58:18,229
You killed him!

532
00:58:35,413 --> 00:58:37,039
Is somebody in there? Open up.

533
00:58:37,878 --> 00:58:40,147
Break it down. Come on.

534
00:58:42,901 --> 00:58:44,013
Hit it again.

535
00:58:45,749 --> 00:58:46,764
Again.

536
00:59:09,779 --> 00:59:11,568
Jesse! My God. What happened?

537
00:59:11,603 --> 00:59:14,473
I killed him. I killed him.

538
00:59:17,523 --> 00:59:20,141
Jesse, my God. You're hurt.
What happened?

539
00:59:20,179 --> 00:59:22,284
I... I killed Grady.

540
00:59:26,675 --> 00:59:28,617
Lisa, I killed Schneider.

541
00:59:29,875 --> 00:59:32,111
Oh, no. My God!

542
00:59:33,555 --> 00:59:35,115
I'm so scared!

543
00:59:35,154 --> 00:59:37,358
Jesse,
what are you talking about?

544
00:59:38,642 --> 00:59:39,787
He's inside me.

545
00:59:41,074 --> 00:59:42,154
I'm scared.

546
00:59:42,194 --> 00:59:43,656
Jesse, who is doing this to you?

547
00:59:43,698 --> 00:59:45,127
Fred Krueger!

548
00:59:46,578 --> 00:59:47,985
He's inside me...

549
00:59:48,017 --> 00:59:50,570
and he wants to take me again!

550
00:59:56,754 --> 00:59:59,142
This is not happening.

551
00:59:59,185 --> 01:00:01,901
It's got to be everything
you've taken in...

552
01:00:01,937 --> 01:00:04,620
Schneider,
the diary, the glove...

553
01:00:04,657 --> 01:00:05,769
only it's all mixed up.

554
01:00:05,808 --> 01:00:09,932
Christ, what do I have to do
to make you understand me?

555
01:00:11,056 --> 01:00:14,089
Last night, he made me
try to kill my sister.

556
01:00:16,976 --> 01:00:19,790
I got blood on my hands.

557
01:00:23,887 --> 01:00:26,669
He owns me.

558
01:00:44,174 --> 01:00:47,044
Could somebody turn down
the heat in the pool?

559
01:00:53,166 --> 01:00:54,759
What's going on?

560
01:01:00,845 --> 01:01:02,122
Shit!

561
01:01:03,309 --> 01:01:04,389
Yay, Rocky!

562
01:01:04,429 --> 01:01:06,338
Our hero!

563
01:01:14,316 --> 01:01:17,186
Come on. I just want you
to listen to this.

564
01:01:17,229 --> 01:01:20,578
It's something Nancy said
in the last page of her diary.

565
01:01:20,621 --> 01:01:21,733
Listen.

566
01:01:22,797 --> 01:01:24,869
"He is evil itself.

567
01:01:24,908 --> 01:01:27,690
"I know now that I brought him
into my world.

568
01:01:27,724 --> 01:01:29,131
"We all did.

569
01:01:29,163 --> 01:01:31,051
"Gave him
all the energy he needed.

570
01:01:31,083 --> 01:01:34,727
"Our screams
were all he needed."

571
01:01:43,755 --> 01:01:46,406
Jesse, she wasn't crazy.

572
01:01:46,442 --> 01:01:47,871
All this really happened.

573
01:01:47,914 --> 01:01:49,769
You can fight him.

574
01:01:55,850 --> 01:01:57,922
Oh, God. He's coming back.

575
01:01:57,962 --> 01:01:59,107
Get out of here, Lisa!

576
01:01:59,146 --> 01:02:00,422
Jesse, fight him!

577
01:02:00,458 --> 01:02:01,702
I can't.

578
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:05,798
Fight it, Jesse.

579
01:02:07,754 --> 01:02:10,754
You created him!
You can destroy him!

580
01:02:10,794 --> 01:02:13,095
Lisa! Open this door!

581
01:02:13,129 --> 01:02:15,812
He is living off of your fear.

582
01:02:15,849 --> 01:02:17,375
- Jesse, fight him.
- I can't!

583
01:02:17,417 --> 01:02:18,529
Yes, you can!

584
01:02:19,561 --> 01:02:20,641
Fight him!

585
01:02:20,681 --> 01:02:23,616
You're not afraid of him.
He doesn't even exist!

586
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,178
Oh, my God!

587
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:45,120
He can't fight me.

588
01:02:45,159 --> 01:02:46,621
I'm him.

589
01:03:31,909 --> 01:03:32,989
It's getting too hot!

590
01:03:33,029 --> 01:03:35,003
Get out!

591
01:03:35,045 --> 01:03:36,735
Get me out!

592
01:03:49,315 --> 01:03:50,908
Jesse, help.

593
01:03:50,948 --> 01:03:52,736
There is no Jesse!

594
01:03:52,771 --> 01:03:54,332
I'm Jesse now!

595
01:03:55,331 --> 01:03:57,273
Get away from me!

596
01:04:00,803 --> 01:04:02,396
Kill me, Lisa.

597
01:04:03,267 --> 01:04:04,827
Please kill me.

598
01:04:09,794 --> 01:04:11,103
Come on, Lisa.

599
01:04:11,139 --> 01:04:12,633
Kill him!

600
01:04:30,849 --> 01:04:32,191
I love you, Lisa.

601
01:04:36,577 --> 01:04:38,966
Oh, God.

602
01:04:41,505 --> 01:04:42,967
Oh, please.

603
01:04:46,272 --> 01:04:47,865
I love you, Lisa.

604
01:04:52,544 --> 01:04:54,683
Jesse, help!

605
01:05:29,470 --> 01:05:30,844
Hey, is everybody OK?

606
01:05:30,878 --> 01:05:32,219
Search me.

607
01:05:36,574 --> 01:05:38,200
What's going on?

608
01:05:51,933 --> 01:05:53,395
Wait a minute! Wait!

609
01:06:20,315 --> 01:06:22,704
Lisa, are you all right?

610
01:06:22,747 --> 01:06:23,860
Mommy.

611
01:06:39,962 --> 01:06:41,849
Get her out of here!

612
01:06:41,882 --> 01:06:42,994
All right!

613
01:06:46,394 --> 01:06:47,888
Just calm down, all right?

614
01:06:48,729 --> 01:06:50,136
Relax.

615
01:06:52,697 --> 01:06:54,258
It's going to be all right.

616
01:06:55,961 --> 01:06:57,488
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

617
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:03,054
Just tell us what you want,
all right?

618
01:07:06,264 --> 01:07:08,151
I'm here to help you.

619
01:07:08,184 --> 01:07:10,672
Help yourself, fucker!

620
01:07:22,456 --> 01:07:25,936
You are all my children now.

621
01:07:31,639 --> 01:07:33,013
- Daddy!
- Oh, shit!

622
01:07:37,175 --> 01:07:38,385
What the hell are you doing?

623
01:07:58,742 --> 01:07:59,854
Where'd he go?

624
01:12:00,359 --> 01:12:01,985
Come to me, Lisa.

625
01:12:08,167 --> 01:12:10,175
Jesse, I know you're in there.

626
01:12:10,215 --> 01:12:12,484
- Stop him!
- No. Jesse's dead.

627
01:12:24,039 --> 01:12:26,373
I love you, Jesse.

628
01:12:55,332 --> 01:12:57,503
Come back to me, Lisa.

629
01:13:02,020 --> 01:13:03,995
I am not afraid of you.

630
01:13:06,820 --> 01:13:08,707
He's in there...

631
01:13:08,740 --> 01:13:10,780
and I want him back!

632
01:13:12,867 --> 01:13:14,940
I'm going to take him
away from you...

633
01:13:15,811 --> 01:13:19,259
and you are gonna go
straight back to hell...

634
01:13:19,299 --> 01:13:20,761
you son of a bitch!

635
01:13:20,803 --> 01:13:22,591
No. Jesse's dead!

636
01:13:26,019 --> 01:13:27,644
Come back to me, Jesse.

637
01:13:29,026 --> 01:13:30,782
I love you.

638
01:13:30,819 --> 01:13:32,607
Come back to me.

639
01:13:32,643 --> 01:13:34,071
He's dead!

640
01:13:38,978 --> 01:13:40,384
He can't hold you, Jesse.

641
01:13:40,418 --> 01:13:42,273
He's losing his grip.

642
01:13:42,306 --> 01:13:43,735
You can get out.

643
01:13:47,746 --> 01:13:49,949
He'll die with me.

644
01:13:59,744 --> 01:14:02,133
He'll die with both of us.

645
01:17:17,653 --> 01:17:19,279
It's great to have you
home again, Jess.

646
01:17:19,317 --> 01:17:20,746
I can't believe I'm going back.

647
01:17:20,789 --> 01:17:23,244
- I'm glad.
- Good.

648
01:17:23,285 --> 01:17:24,976
- Have a good day.
- OK.

649
01:17:25,973 --> 01:17:27,086
Thanks, Mom.

650
01:17:43,988 --> 01:17:45,614
What is so funny?

651
01:17:47,156 --> 01:17:49,163
That was a really great party.

652
01:17:49,204 --> 01:17:50,611
Thanks, Lise.

653
01:17:50,643 --> 01:17:51,952
Thanks a lot.

654
01:17:52,852 --> 01:17:55,273
I can't believe
it's actually all over.

655
01:17:55,316 --> 01:17:56,908
Let's not talk about it.

656
01:18:04,530 --> 01:18:06,221
What is this?

657
01:18:06,259 --> 01:18:09,193
Am I going crazy,
or is this bus going too fast?

658
01:18:09,234 --> 01:18:10,663
It's going fine.

659
01:18:10,706 --> 01:18:11,983
No problem.

660
01:18:16,626 --> 01:18:18,535
This bus is going too fast.

661
01:18:20,146 --> 01:18:23,244
Lisa, it's starting to speed up.

662
01:18:23,282 --> 01:18:24,710
It's fine.

663
01:18:24,754 --> 01:18:25,833
Driver!

664
01:18:25,874 --> 01:18:26,953
Driver, stop!

665
01:18:26,994 --> 01:18:28,335
Jesse, just sit down.

666
