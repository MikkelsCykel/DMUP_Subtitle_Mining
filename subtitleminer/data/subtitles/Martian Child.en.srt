1
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:01,158
Uh... oh, no.

2
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:04,759
I suppose there's one
in every group, one oddball...

3
00:01:04,802 --> 00:01:05,791
- who never fits in.
- Let's go get him.

4
00:01:05,836 --> 00:01:06,825
- Come on!
- Yeah.

5
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,269
Well, that was me...

6
00:01:08,305 --> 00:01:10,432
- Aah!
- David Gordon.

7
00:01:11,341 --> 00:01:13,935
I found my escape
through my stories.

8
00:01:14,611 --> 00:01:17,171
My imagination was a...
was like a rocket ship...

9
00:01:17,214 --> 00:01:19,011
that took me far away
where I could look at life...

10
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:20,311
from a safe distance...

11
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:23,751
which, I guess, is what I...
I now do in my books.

12
00:01:23,787 --> 00:01:25,345
As unlucky
as I was in childhood...

13
00:01:25,389 --> 00:01:29,689
I was very, very lucky
as a writer.

14
00:01:30,594 --> 00:01:34,928
Um, so instead of becoming a
well-adjusted, normal person...

15
00:01:34,965 --> 00:01:38,264
I became a kind of a deranged,
successful person.

16
00:01:39,303 --> 00:01:41,032
And I'm not sure
which is preferable...

17
00:01:41,071 --> 00:01:42,868
but it doesn't really matter
'cause you don't get to choose.

18
00:01:42,906 --> 00:01:45,204
But to answer your original
question more directly...

19
00:01:45,242 --> 00:01:46,971
yes, I do believe
that in every work of fiction...

20
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:49,069
there is one character that,
for the author...

21
00:01:49,113 --> 00:01:50,910
is in some ways
autobiographical...

22
00:01:50,948 --> 00:01:54,611
<i>and that certainly holds true
for Dracoban.</i>

23
00:01:55,953 --> 00:01:56,942
You know, like in a dream...

24
00:01:56,987 --> 00:02:00,320
one character, um,
usually represents you...

25
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,556
but in this case,
it's not who you expect...

26
00:02:04,061 --> 00:02:07,189
um, because, you see,
I'm not the human.

27
00:02:10,267 --> 00:02:11,529
I'm the creature.

28
00:02:15,672 --> 00:02:17,333
Is that good?

29
00:02:31,121 --> 00:02:32,179
David.

30
00:02:34,024 --> 00:02:35,116
Hey, Harlee.

31
00:02:38,362 --> 00:02:39,886
Thought I might see you
here today.

32
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:41,830
Yeah. I thought
I might see you, too.

33
00:02:51,809 --> 00:02:53,174
Sweet of you to come.

34
00:02:54,211 --> 00:02:55,940
Yeah, I think...
I think we spent...

35
00:02:55,979 --> 00:02:59,073
almost every single birthday
together since the third grade.

36
00:03:00,884 --> 00:03:01,908
Hi, Somewhere.

37
00:03:03,253 --> 00:03:05,312
Somewhere's happy to see you.

38
00:03:07,658 --> 00:03:08,852
So what do you think, honestly?

39
00:03:08,892 --> 00:03:09,950
Are you kidding?

40
00:03:09,993 --> 00:03:11,961
I love the idea
of you adopting a child.

41
00:03:11,995 --> 00:03:13,087
I think it's so beautiful...

42
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:14,927
for you to open up
your heart like that.

43
00:03:14,965 --> 00:03:16,330
Liz thinks I'm crazy, you know?

44
00:03:16,366 --> 00:03:17,890
I mean, what if she's right,
you know?

45
00:03:17,935 --> 00:03:19,527
What if I'm...
What if I'm not up to it?

46
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:20,594
Let me tell you something.

47
00:03:20,637 --> 00:03:23,231
My mother raised five kids,
and never, for one second...

48
00:03:23,273 --> 00:03:25,639
did she question whether she
was cut out to be a parent.

49
00:03:25,676 --> 00:03:26,665
And she was great, right?

50
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,439
No, the worst.

51
00:03:28,478 --> 00:03:30,070
Her shrink has a house
in Laguna because of her.

52
00:03:30,113 --> 00:03:31,512
Oh.

53
00:03:31,548 --> 00:03:34,312
Just the fact that you're even
asking yourself the question...

54
00:03:34,351 --> 00:03:36,342
pretty much proves
you're qualified.

55
00:03:36,386 --> 00:03:38,445
Most people spend
more time worrying about...

56
00:03:38,488 --> 00:03:40,888
how to raise tomatoes
than they do their own kids.

57
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,793
You even imagine how happy
Mary would be about this?

58
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:48,893
Yeah, but that's not
a good enough reason to do it.

59
00:03:52,002 --> 00:03:54,197
You've got a lot of love
left in your heart.

60
00:03:55,973 --> 00:03:57,668
You better come back here!

61
00:04:12,556 --> 00:04:13,750
Hi, David. Hi.

62
00:04:15,092 --> 00:04:17,492
Hi, Sophie.
It's been a long time.

63
00:04:17,527 --> 00:04:19,392
Yeah, yeah, been a few years.

64
00:04:19,429 --> 00:04:20,418
You look well.

65
00:04:20,464 --> 00:04:22,125
Thanks. You, too.

66
00:04:23,634 --> 00:04:25,693
Come on, throw the ball!

67
00:04:26,837 --> 00:04:28,737
Just not ready to commit
to something like this.

68
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:35,305
I'm sorry.

69
00:04:35,345 --> 00:04:37,210
Didn't you know I was gonna
ask you something like this?

70
00:04:38,548 --> 00:04:40,516
Didn't want to say no
over the phone.

71
00:04:42,586 --> 00:04:43,575
Right.

72
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,678
It didn't seem right.

73
00:04:46,089 --> 00:04:47,113
I'm really sorry.

74
00:04:51,094 --> 00:04:52,755
When girls go shopping...

75
00:04:57,334 --> 00:04:58,926
Hi.

76
00:04:58,969 --> 00:05:00,163
What's your name?

77
00:05:00,203 --> 00:05:01,192
Esther.

78
00:05:01,238 --> 00:05:02,796
Hi, Esther.

79
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:04,602
I know who you are.

80
00:05:04,641 --> 00:05:05,767
You do?

81
00:05:05,809 --> 00:05:08,073
You're the man who Sophie
called about Dennis...

82
00:05:08,111 --> 00:05:11,672
but you don't want him
'cause your wife's dead.

83
00:05:11,715 --> 00:05:12,739
Who told you that?

84
00:05:12,783 --> 00:05:14,080
Dennis.

85
00:05:17,654 --> 00:05:20,020
Are you a friend of his,
or what?

86
00:05:20,057 --> 00:05:22,548
No. He's a weirdo.

87
00:05:22,592 --> 00:05:24,924
He doesn't have any friends.

88
00:05:24,962 --> 00:05:26,122
He doesn't?

89
00:05:28,031 --> 00:05:29,589
Where is he hangin' out?

90
00:05:31,802 --> 00:05:33,235
He's in the box.

91
00:05:34,705 --> 00:05:36,696
He doesn't come out until night.

92
00:05:38,141 --> 00:05:40,132
Why does he do that?

93
00:05:40,177 --> 00:05:43,237
The sun. He hates the sun.

94
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,406
Why does he hate the sun?

95
00:05:44,448 --> 00:05:47,212
I don't know.
Because he thinks it's too sunny?

96
00:05:47,884 --> 00:05:49,181
Right.

97
00:05:52,823 --> 00:05:55,018
I told him you were weird.

98
00:05:58,228 --> 00:06:00,253
He is in the box.

99
00:06:06,737 --> 00:06:09,297
Oh! Man! Ooh!

100
00:06:09,339 --> 00:06:10,328
But I don't understand...

101
00:06:10,374 --> 00:06:11,966
why did she call you
in the first place?

102
00:06:12,009 --> 00:06:13,840
Well, she thought she had
found a good match for us.

103
00:06:13,877 --> 00:06:16,141
Aren't, like, single men like
the bottom of the totem pole?

104
00:06:16,179 --> 00:06:18,079
Hey, I am not a single man.

105
00:06:18,115 --> 00:06:19,980
I am a widower...

106
00:06:20,017 --> 00:06:22,383
and that is
the worst of all worlds.

107
00:06:22,419 --> 00:06:25,411
I am in the ground
below the totem pole.

108
00:06:25,455 --> 00:06:26,922
Oh, wow, you know what?

109
00:06:26,957 --> 00:06:28,481
I think it was
really insensitive of her...

110
00:06:28,525 --> 00:06:29,514
to call in the first place.

111
00:06:29,559 --> 00:06:30,583
I mean,
it's only been two years.

112
00:06:30,627 --> 00:06:32,322
- Oh! Oh!
- Hey!

113
00:06:33,063 --> 00:06:35,224
- Guys, get off the dog.
- We're just playing.

114
00:06:35,265 --> 00:06:36,289
- Yeah.
- Oh!

115
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:39,530
That dog is like
200 years old in human...

116
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:41,662
Would you do that to Grandma?

117
00:06:41,705 --> 00:06:44,003
Guys, get off!

118
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:45,804
They drive me nuts,
and they're mine.

119
00:06:45,842 --> 00:06:48,140
I mean, I don't know why
Mary even wanted to adopt.

120
00:06:48,178 --> 00:06:50,203
Well, she was adopted herself
and, you know...

121
00:06:50,247 --> 00:06:52,272
Yeah, but it was something
you were gonna do together...

122
00:06:52,315 --> 00:06:53,304
- and, you know.
- Yeah. Yeah.

123
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:54,612
But, hey, it's not gonna happen.

124
00:06:54,651 --> 00:06:55,982
You're like preaching
to the converted.

125
00:06:56,019 --> 00:06:57,077
Okay. Good...

126
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,712
because here's a voice
from the trenches...

127
00:06:58,755 --> 00:07:00,382
"Parenting is really hard. "

128
00:07:00,424 --> 00:07:01,516
All right?

129
00:07:01,558 --> 00:07:03,583
It's hard, and you need
at least two people.

130
00:07:03,627 --> 00:07:05,822
Well, you know,
we had Mom and Dad.

131
00:07:05,862 --> 00:07:07,523
We had two people,
and they hated being parents.

132
00:07:07,564 --> 00:07:08,929
I'm just saying there
are no guarantees.

133
00:07:08,965 --> 00:07:10,193
There's plenty
of single parents.

134
00:07:10,233 --> 00:07:12,724
All right. Well, I don't want
to see you get hurt.

135
00:07:12,769 --> 00:07:14,737
I mean, you could have
a kid of rage or something.

136
00:07:14,771 --> 00:07:16,102
Kid of rage?

137
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:17,629
Yeah, well,
there was some TV movie...

138
00:07:17,674 --> 00:07:19,198
and they were crazy.

139
00:07:19,242 --> 00:07:22,211
<i>Listen, I got to go take
The Omen One and Two...</i>

140
00:07:22,245 --> 00:07:23,803
to soccer practice, okay?

141
00:07:23,847 --> 00:07:25,838
So just stay here.
You made the right choice.

142
00:07:25,882 --> 00:07:27,144
That was a good decision, okay?

143
00:07:27,184 --> 00:07:28,811
Have some coffee
or some food or something.

144
00:07:28,852 --> 00:07:30,444
We have snacks.

145
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:23,667
Hey, I miss her, too.

146
00:08:36,853 --> 00:08:39,981
Somewhere a dog barked...

147
00:08:40,824 --> 00:08:42,451
and then he licked
his privates.

148
00:08:50,867 --> 00:08:51,925
What do you think, Somewhere?

149
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:55,164
You think we could do it alone?

150
00:08:57,007 --> 00:08:58,099
Huh?

151
00:09:02,012 --> 00:09:03,104
Anybody home?

152
00:09:05,782 --> 00:09:07,443
Uh, listen, Chief, I, uh...

153
00:09:07,484 --> 00:09:08,781
I brought you some sun block...

154
00:09:08,818 --> 00:09:10,979
very strong stuff.

155
00:09:11,021 --> 00:09:14,513
SPF 45...
That's sun protection factor...

156
00:09:14,558 --> 00:09:17,049
and, uh, helps you against
the ultraviolet rays...

157
00:09:17,093 --> 00:09:19,960
which are... You know,
they call them the UV rays.

158
00:09:19,996 --> 00:09:23,955
Anyway, it's hypoallergenic
and waterproof.

159
00:09:25,735 --> 00:09:27,794
Just leave it for you.

160
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,102
Hi, Sophie, how you doin'?

161
00:09:32,142 --> 00:09:33,166
Not bad.

162
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,704
You good?

163
00:09:39,115 --> 00:09:40,707
Good.

164
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,115
Didn't expect
to see you back here.

165
00:09:42,152 --> 00:09:43,915
Yeah, I wanted to bring
the kid some sun block.

166
00:09:44,654 --> 00:09:45,678
Oh.

167
00:09:48,325 --> 00:09:49,417
What was that?

168
00:09:49,459 --> 00:09:51,017
It's his Polaroid.

169
00:09:51,061 --> 00:09:53,586
He likes taking pictures.
There's no film in it.

170
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:56,428
He's just... ha...
likes taking pictures.

171
00:09:56,466 --> 00:09:57,899
Hmm.

172
00:10:01,004 --> 00:10:03,564
Just as a point of interest...

173
00:10:03,607 --> 00:10:05,097
what made you think
I'd be a good match...

174
00:10:05,141 --> 00:10:07,371
for a boy who spends
most of his time in a box?

175
00:10:09,512 --> 00:10:11,036
He thinks
he's from another planet.

176
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:15,008
Yah! Aah!

177
00:10:15,051 --> 00:10:16,746
Aah!

178
00:10:16,786 --> 00:10:18,583
Yah! Unh!

179
00:10:18,622 --> 00:10:19,611
- Cut!
- Looks great.

180
00:10:19,656 --> 00:10:21,556
Looks great, guys.
Thank you.

181
00:10:21,591 --> 00:10:22,956
- We're going in.
- So, buddy, what do you think?

182
00:10:22,993 --> 00:10:24,620
Where is the pathos?

183
00:10:24,661 --> 00:10:26,094
What?

184
00:10:26,129 --> 00:10:27,687
Dude, where is the pathos?

185
00:10:27,731 --> 00:10:28,857
The Earl of Dracoban is dying.

186
00:10:28,898 --> 00:10:29,887
- This is a guy...
- Buddy!

187
00:10:29,933 --> 00:10:31,867
Who has fought his way
across the galaxy.

188
00:10:31,901 --> 00:10:33,163
Lastupon... Lastupon
was a blue dwarf

189
00:10:33,203 --> 00:10:35,433
that became a red giant.

190
00:10:35,472 --> 00:10:38,532
It's the red dwarf phase
of the giant.

191
00:10:38,575 --> 00:10:39,564
What are you talk...

192
00:10:39,609 --> 00:10:40,769
Look, I don't know
what I'm talkin' about.

193
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:42,277
But this I do know...

194
00:10:42,312 --> 00:10:45,748
I see a production that is
honoring the world of your book.

195
00:10:45,782 --> 00:10:46,874
Really,
takin' it very seriously.

196
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:47,905
That's what I see.

197
00:10:47,951 --> 00:10:49,441
- Speaking of your book...
- Aah!

198
00:10:51,087 --> 00:10:52,611
Guess who I got
a call from today.

199
00:10:52,656 --> 00:10:54,920
Your publisher, our publisher.

200
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:57,119
- Tina.
- Tina.

201
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,526
<i>Did she ask you how The Revenge
of Dracoban is coming?</i>

202
00:10:59,562 --> 00:11:00,586
No, she shouted it.

203
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:01,995
Ah.

204
00:11:02,032 --> 00:11:03,659
You know what the problem is?

205
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,031
When I wrote the novel...

206
00:11:06,569 --> 00:11:09,402
there's this giant massacre
at the end and everybody dies.

207
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,997
- I know.
- All the characters are dead.

208
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:12,030
I know. I sold it.

209
00:11:12,075 --> 00:11:13,064
It's a problem.

210
00:11:13,109 --> 00:11:14,098
That's great.

211
00:11:14,144 --> 00:11:16,271
Let's move on
to the master scene.

212
00:11:16,313 --> 00:11:17,337
What am I gonna tell Tina?

213
00:11:18,948 --> 00:11:23,510
Tell Tina that somewhere in
the deepest, darkest bowels...

214
00:11:23,553 --> 00:11:28,081
of Castle Zeptar,
the earl's necromancers...

215
00:11:28,124 --> 00:11:30,854
are bringing him back
to life against his will...

216
00:11:32,796 --> 00:11:34,627
if that's possible.
Is that any good?

217
00:11:34,664 --> 00:11:36,029
Sure.

218
00:11:38,902 --> 00:11:39,994
Lighting!

219
00:11:42,672 --> 00:11:44,572
Good morning! Your sword!

220
00:11:45,608 --> 00:11:47,075
Move ahead!

221
00:11:48,611 --> 00:11:52,138
David,
and, hello, earth to David.

222
00:11:52,182 --> 00:11:54,514
A kid who sits
in a box all day...

223
00:11:54,551 --> 00:11:57,577
is a giant red flag,
all right?

224
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:01,181
It's like the equivalent
of buying a used car...

225
00:12:01,224 --> 00:12:03,249
and ignoring the oil spill
in the driveway.

226
00:12:03,293 --> 00:12:05,625
You know, for a non-writer
you're becoming the queen...

227
00:12:05,662 --> 00:12:07,357
- of the muscular analogy.
- Okay.

228
00:12:08,231 --> 00:12:10,722
Listen, the thing about kids...

229
00:12:10,767 --> 00:12:12,860
and I wouldn't trade
mine for the world...

230
00:12:12,902 --> 00:12:15,632
is that they keep comin'
at you, all right?

231
00:12:15,672 --> 00:12:17,037
They're...
They're like mosquitoes...

232
00:12:17,073 --> 00:12:18,597
suckin' the life out of you.

233
00:12:18,641 --> 00:12:22,202
They take away your life,
your privacy, your identity.

234
00:12:22,245 --> 00:12:23,439
You should work
for Planned Parenthood.

235
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,572
You joke.

236
00:12:25,382 --> 00:12:28,317
You forget that whole shelf-full
of books you wrote...

237
00:12:28,351 --> 00:12:30,911
or your knowledge
of California wines...

238
00:12:30,954 --> 00:12:33,115
or that you ever
ran a marathon.

239
00:12:33,156 --> 00:12:34,521
All right,
here's the thing, Liz.

240
00:12:34,557 --> 00:12:35,956
I never ran a marathon.

241
00:12:35,992 --> 00:12:37,152
I don't want
to run a marathon.

242
00:12:37,193 --> 00:12:40,128
I want to do something
meaningful, you know?

243
00:12:41,498 --> 00:12:42,487
And I get all
the arguments against it.

244
00:12:42,532 --> 00:12:43,556
I even get the one that says...

245
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,625
"I don't know if I want to bring
another kid into this world. "

246
00:12:45,668 --> 00:12:47,863
But how do you argue
with the logic...

247
00:12:47,904 --> 00:12:49,701
of loving one
that's already here?

248
00:12:53,109 --> 00:12:55,976
<i>Trans fobo medio.
Trans fobo medio.</i>

249
00:12:56,012 --> 00:12:59,848
<i>Trans fobo medio.</i>

250
00:12:59,883 --> 00:13:01,748
<i>- Dennis!
- Tran fobo medio.</i>

251
00:13:01,785 --> 00:13:04,310
Dennis, what are you doing?

252
00:13:04,354 --> 00:13:06,254
- It's raining!
- I'm waiting for David.

253
00:13:06,289 --> 00:13:07,779
What?

254
00:13:07,824 --> 00:13:10,019
The man with UV protection.

255
00:13:10,059 --> 00:13:11,321
Come in.

256
00:13:30,914 --> 00:13:32,279
Get over here!

257
00:13:32,315 --> 00:13:33,942
Ahem, anybody in there?

258
00:13:35,852 --> 00:13:37,114
Brought you somethin'.

259
00:13:43,927 --> 00:13:45,952
One, two, three, four...

260
00:13:47,397 --> 00:13:49,627
Those really help
cut out the glare...

261
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:50,655
uh, one...

262
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,100
in your ongoing battle
with the sun.

263
00:13:54,437 --> 00:13:55,631
Thank you.

264
00:13:55,672 --> 00:13:56,969
You're welcome.

265
00:13:57,574 --> 00:13:58,598
One...

266
00:14:01,478 --> 00:14:03,173
Quality throw, chief.

267
00:14:49,859 --> 00:14:51,383
Nice to see ya.

268
00:14:51,427 --> 00:14:53,361
Very nice to see ya, actually.

269
00:14:59,669 --> 00:15:01,261
He's not a puppy
in a window, you know?

270
00:15:01,304 --> 00:15:02,498
I know.

271
00:15:02,539 --> 00:15:04,700
All right,
catch it, catch it.

272
00:15:04,741 --> 00:15:06,436
- Go for it.
- Okay.

273
00:15:07,877 --> 00:15:10,573
You see, he's been abandoned,
emotionally abused...

274
00:15:10,613 --> 00:15:12,103
he's classified
as "hard to place. "

275
00:15:12,148 --> 00:15:14,013
He's... He's never
had a family of his own.

276
00:15:14,951 --> 00:15:16,942
I know, but am I
the right person for him?

277
00:15:16,986 --> 00:15:18,010
I mean, I'm just a writer.

278
00:15:18,054 --> 00:15:20,921
He's seen a lot of doctors,
if that's what you mean.

279
00:15:20,957 --> 00:15:22,948
That's not what he needs.

280
00:15:32,669 --> 00:15:33,761
Oh, you!

281
00:15:34,871 --> 00:15:36,133
At least tell me
what you're thinkin'.

282
00:15:38,207 --> 00:15:40,607
I'm thinking I must be
out of my mind.

283
00:15:45,682 --> 00:15:47,479
I see you remembered
your sunscreen.

284
00:15:48,151 --> 00:15:50,813
You know, it works just as good
if you don't put so much on.

285
00:15:54,123 --> 00:15:55,249
Is that your weight belt?

286
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:57,589
Earth's gravity is weak.

287
00:15:57,627 --> 00:16:00,152
Mars is constantly
pulling me back.

288
00:16:00,196 --> 00:16:01,823
So without all that stuff...

289
00:16:01,864 --> 00:16:03,923
you think
you'd just float away?

290
00:16:05,101 --> 00:16:06,125
Uh-huh.

291
00:16:07,904 --> 00:16:09,166
That ever happen before?

292
00:16:09,205 --> 00:16:10,729
Yes.

293
00:16:10,773 --> 00:16:12,240
When?

294
00:16:12,275 --> 00:16:14,243
With another
mommy and daddy.

295
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,669
Sophie, someone

296
00:16:18,715 --> 00:16:20,342
- stole my ice cream!
- Hey! Wait up!

297
00:16:22,152 --> 00:16:24,950
Uh, uncommunicative...

298
00:16:24,988 --> 00:16:26,717
a tendency to steal things...

299
00:16:26,756 --> 00:16:28,917
inability to form
personal attachments...

300
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:30,357
or distinguish
between right and wrong...

301
00:16:30,393 --> 00:16:31,485
and he thinks...

302
00:16:33,496 --> 00:16:34,963
He thinks
he's from outer space.

303
00:16:36,766 --> 00:16:38,233
Not to put too sharp
a point on it...

304
00:16:38,268 --> 00:16:40,566
but I think he thinks
he's from Mars.

305
00:16:40,603 --> 00:16:42,127
How do you plan to deal
with that, Mr. Gordon?

306
00:16:42,172 --> 00:16:44,037
Fantasy is my business.

307
00:16:44,073 --> 00:16:45,665
It's... It's what
I do for a living.

308
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:48,302
And one of the things
I've learned about fantasy...

309
00:16:48,344 --> 00:16:49,868
uh... in my own life...

310
00:16:49,913 --> 00:16:52,643
is that it can be
a survival technique...

311
00:16:52,682 --> 00:16:55,207
you know, kind
of a coping mechanism...

312
00:16:55,251 --> 00:16:57,583
a way to deal with problems
that are bigger than you...

313
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:58,951
bigger than you're...

314
00:16:58,988 --> 00:17:01,183
you're capable
of dealing with.

315
00:17:01,224 --> 00:17:03,215
Uh, so, uh, you know...

316
00:17:03,259 --> 00:17:07,593
the... the... the short answer is,
um, you know...

317
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:10,064
try to find that balance
between socializing him...

318
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:12,533
and letting him be who he is.

319
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:15,197
So, um, you know...

320
00:17:15,238 --> 00:17:17,729
um, so, you know,
on the one hand...

321
00:17:17,774 --> 00:17:20,436
uh, help him out
as much as I can...

322
00:17:20,476 --> 00:17:23,968
and on the other hand,
uh, if he wants to...

323
00:17:24,013 --> 00:17:25,002
If this little guy
wants to believe...

324
00:17:25,048 --> 00:17:26,037
he's from another planet...

325
00:17:26,082 --> 00:17:29,574
you know, I mean,
who am I to argue?

326
00:17:29,619 --> 00:17:32,782
This isn't science fiction.
This isn't a short story.

327
00:17:32,822 --> 00:17:34,153
Very often, with our children...

328
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:36,624
we don't get to have
a second draft.

329
00:17:36,659 --> 00:17:37,683
Yeah.

330
00:17:39,162 --> 00:17:41,722
A single man raising
a child with problems...

331
00:17:41,764 --> 00:17:43,493
that are not common,
that are not easy...

332
00:17:43,533 --> 00:17:45,330
you're gonna need
all kinds of help.

333
00:17:45,368 --> 00:17:47,029
You'd need to include us...

334
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,401
- Mm-hmm.
- Include me.

335
00:17:48,438 --> 00:17:49,427
Does anybody have anything?

336
00:17:49,472 --> 00:17:50,666
No.

337
00:17:53,509 --> 00:17:54,771
We're gonna take some time
and think about this.

338
00:17:54,811 --> 00:17:56,278
Thank you, Mr. Gordon.

339
00:17:56,312 --> 00:17:57,609
We'll let you know.

340
00:17:59,682 --> 00:18:00,671
Hello.

341
00:18:00,717 --> 00:18:03,277
Hey, man, what's up?

342
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:05,253
How's things on the planet?

343
00:18:05,288 --> 00:18:06,585
Go away.

344
00:18:07,991 --> 00:18:09,015
What?

345
00:18:13,062 --> 00:18:14,086
Hello.

346
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:15,119
Hey.

347
00:18:15,164 --> 00:18:16,893
Liz, I can't talk right now.
I'm waitin' for the call.

348
00:18:16,933 --> 00:18:19,026
But you have call waiting.

349
00:18:19,068 --> 00:18:20,092
But I don't trust it.

350
00:18:24,574 --> 00:18:26,303
Your uncle is nuts.

351
00:18:40,356 --> 00:18:41,380
Hello.

352
00:18:48,865 --> 00:18:50,196
Really?

353
00:18:58,508 --> 00:18:59,702
Yes!

354
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,075
Thanks for comin'
out here with me today.

355
00:19:07,317 --> 00:19:09,012
It's pretty.

356
00:19:09,052 --> 00:19:12,078
I thought you'd like it.
It's cool.

357
00:19:13,289 --> 00:19:15,223
I like the holding-down belt.

358
00:19:16,993 --> 00:19:18,119
You can wear
the holding-down belt...

359
00:19:18,161 --> 00:19:19,594
all day long if you like.

360
00:19:23,399 --> 00:19:25,560
Listen, Dennis, Mr. Lefkowitz...

361
00:19:25,601 --> 00:19:28,502
said you can come live
in my house if you want.

362
00:19:29,806 --> 00:19:31,467
It'll only be temporary
at first...

363
00:19:31,507 --> 00:19:34,965
but if you like it,
you could stay.

364
00:19:39,549 --> 00:19:41,176
I eat Lucky Charms.

365
00:19:43,419 --> 00:19:47,583
I am a big believer
in a substantial breakfast.

366
00:20:14,817 --> 00:20:16,546
Get your suitcase for you.

367
00:20:16,586 --> 00:20:17,917
I got it.

368
00:20:17,954 --> 00:20:18,978
Okay.

369
00:20:20,923 --> 00:20:22,049
Go ahead.

370
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:29,793
You can cut through here.

371
00:20:29,832 --> 00:20:30,890
Oh, right over here.

372
00:20:33,403 --> 00:20:34,461
Yeah, yeah.

373
00:20:38,941 --> 00:20:40,533
This way, young squire.

374
00:20:45,848 --> 00:20:47,315
Hey, Somewhere!

375
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:49,284
Hey, Somewhere,
Somewhere, down, boy.

376
00:20:49,318 --> 00:20:50,512
Down, boy. Hey, sorry.

377
00:20:50,553 --> 00:20:51,542
That's just Somewhere.

378
00:20:51,587 --> 00:20:52,713
It's just his way
of saying hello.

379
00:20:57,226 --> 00:20:59,387
We don't have those
where I come from.

380
00:21:01,864 --> 00:21:03,331
You're not a dog person, huh?

381
00:21:08,337 --> 00:21:10,271
I'm just waiting
for the boys to get home.

382
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:14,601
Well, what is he doing now?

383
00:21:14,644 --> 00:21:16,202
He's just...
He's just in his room.

384
00:21:17,613 --> 00:21:19,137
Should I give him
some space or go in there?

385
00:21:20,349 --> 00:21:21,816
I'll call you back.
I'll call you back.

386
00:21:27,857 --> 00:21:31,088
This is kind of an a...
of an interesting thing.

387
00:21:31,127 --> 00:21:32,685
It's a special night light.

388
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:37,256
But as you can see, it has
pictures of the planets...

389
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,426
and the solar systems...

390
00:21:38,468 --> 00:21:40,732
and, you see, they
kind of spin around.

391
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:42,431
It's got mirrors.

392
00:21:42,472 --> 00:21:44,770
And lights on the bottom
and pictures.

393
00:21:45,975 --> 00:21:47,806
That's not right.

394
00:21:49,545 --> 00:21:50,705
Yeah?

395
00:21:50,746 --> 00:21:52,270
Well, what do you mean?

396
00:21:52,315 --> 00:21:56,012
You'll have to
make the ceiling bigger...

397
00:21:56,052 --> 00:21:58,543
and you'll have to make
your planet like this.

398
00:21:59,388 --> 00:22:00,685
You're...
You're absolutely right.

399
00:22:00,723 --> 00:22:02,384
For the...
For it to be accurate...

400
00:22:02,425 --> 00:22:05,588
the ceiling would have to be,
I don't know, 100 feet long...

401
00:22:05,628 --> 00:22:08,222
and the earth
would be the size of a pea.

402
00:22:09,665 --> 00:22:10,757
Very, very good.

403
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,995
How do you know
that much about scale?

404
00:22:13,035 --> 00:22:16,095
It took a very long time
to get here.

405
00:22:17,373 --> 00:22:21,434
A very, very, very
long time to get here.

406
00:22:23,546 --> 00:22:25,480
You can get rid of some of
those old clothes if you want.

407
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:28,550
Or we can keep that old stuff...

408
00:22:28,584 --> 00:22:32,042
till it literally disintegrates
and falls off your body.

409
00:22:32,989 --> 00:22:34,820
That's a good way to go, too.

410
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:38,058
That's kinda cool.

411
00:22:38,094 --> 00:22:40,153
I used to be good
at video games.

412
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:42,588
It's not a game.

413
00:22:42,632 --> 00:22:44,031
It's not?

414
00:22:46,002 --> 00:22:47,560
Whatever it is, it's cool.

415
00:22:51,607 --> 00:22:52,596
Should I close the door...

416
00:22:52,642 --> 00:22:55,475
or should I just leave it
open or halfway?

417
00:22:55,511 --> 00:22:58,207
Leave it open?

418
00:22:58,247 --> 00:22:59,271
Mid-way?

419
00:23:25,808 --> 00:23:27,708
Just think of it
as a bigger box.

420
00:23:40,022 --> 00:23:42,388
All right, Dennis, I think
you're gonna enjoy this.

421
00:23:42,425 --> 00:23:45,622
But, listen, before we eat,
rules of the house...

422
00:23:45,661 --> 00:23:48,926
first rule,
no girls after 10 P.M.

423
00:23:50,066 --> 00:23:51,328
Just kidding on that one.

424
00:23:52,435 --> 00:23:54,300
Uh... the first rule
is that there...

425
00:23:54,337 --> 00:23:57,135
There really aren't
any rules, you know?

426
00:23:57,173 --> 00:23:59,539
Just maybe
some basic stuff about...

427
00:23:59,575 --> 00:24:00,633
Oh!

428
00:24:03,245 --> 00:24:05,372
Better put a sticker
there, I guess.

429
00:24:05,414 --> 00:24:08,076
Listen, maybe we can,
uh, have a...

430
00:24:08,117 --> 00:24:10,608
I don't know,
more of a guideline...

431
00:24:10,653 --> 00:24:12,280
more than a rule,
that we don't...

432
00:24:12,321 --> 00:24:14,380
um, wear
the sunglasses indoors...

433
00:24:14,423 --> 00:24:16,857
just for
navigational purposes.

434
00:24:18,828 --> 00:24:20,295
I mean, this is
a grilled cheese sandwich.

435
00:24:20,329 --> 00:24:21,660
Uh, I made you
a grilled cheese sandwich...

436
00:24:21,697 --> 00:24:22,994
'cause I love
grilled cheese sandwiches.

437
00:24:23,032 --> 00:24:26,399
I think that they're,
you know, an American classic.

438
00:24:28,671 --> 00:24:31,037
I used to eat these a lot
when I was a kid.

439
00:24:31,073 --> 00:24:32,301
I loved 'em.

440
00:24:39,281 --> 00:24:41,010
I eat Lucky Charms.

441
00:24:42,985 --> 00:24:45,545
Yeah, sure, for breakfast,
you can have Lucky Charms...

442
00:24:45,588 --> 00:24:48,455
or maybe some granola or yogurt,
any kind of cereal.

443
00:24:48,491 --> 00:24:49,719
That sounds great.

444
00:24:50,826 --> 00:24:54,284
<i>So, anyway, bon appétit.</i>

445
00:24:58,601 --> 00:25:00,034
Try that.

446
00:25:07,877 --> 00:25:10,141
I eat Lucky Charms.

447
00:25:10,179 --> 00:25:12,113
Oh, here we go.

448
00:25:14,083 --> 00:25:15,175
Look at that.

449
00:25:17,386 --> 00:25:18,819
All right, let's get more...

450
00:25:18,854 --> 00:25:21,220
because, you know,
you never know.

451
00:25:21,257 --> 00:25:23,725
We gotta stock up.

452
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:26,284
Never know if there's
gonna be the avian bird flu...

453
00:25:26,328 --> 00:25:27,488
or bubonic plague...

454
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:31,125
or any other sort of pandemic
is gonna come along...

455
00:25:31,167 --> 00:25:33,658
and really wreck your day.

456
00:25:33,703 --> 00:25:35,637
Want to make sure
you have the right supplies.

457
00:25:43,379 --> 00:25:45,711
This stuff has...
This stuff has gotta have...

458
00:25:45,748 --> 00:25:48,046
a shelf life
of about 33,000 years.

459
00:25:50,019 --> 00:25:51,008
If anything happened...

460
00:25:51,053 --> 00:25:55,615
the, um, apocalypse,
the four horsemen show up...

461
00:25:55,658 --> 00:25:58,218
this stuff is still
magically delicious.

462
00:26:06,469 --> 00:26:08,130
We're Lucky Charms guys.

463
00:26:13,542 --> 00:26:14,941
Mary?

464
00:26:24,286 --> 00:26:26,049
Dennis, are you okay?
What are you doin'?

465
00:26:26,088 --> 00:26:27,555
Watching you.

466
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:30,919
Oh!

467
00:26:32,695 --> 00:26:34,185
It's a little late for that.

468
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:35,254
Dennis?

469
00:26:39,702 --> 00:26:41,499
Dennis, what are you doin'?

470
00:26:41,537 --> 00:26:43,266
Come on, let's...
Let's put the camera away.

471
00:26:43,305 --> 00:26:44,533
Dennis, please.
Let's put the camera away.

472
00:26:44,573 --> 00:26:45,597
Come on now.

473
00:26:46,709 --> 00:26:50,907
Beware!
I almost Disney-grated you.

474
00:26:50,946 --> 00:26:52,436
You almost disintegrated me?

475
00:26:52,481 --> 00:26:54,346
Why would you want to do that?

476
00:26:56,218 --> 00:26:58,778
Hey, it's the, um... ahem.

477
00:26:58,821 --> 00:27:00,015
It's the middle
of the night, chief.

478
00:27:00,055 --> 00:27:01,317
What are you doin'
with all these pictures?

479
00:27:01,357 --> 00:27:03,052
And what are you doin' up?

480
00:27:03,092 --> 00:27:04,559
Learning.

481
00:27:04,593 --> 00:27:06,652
Learning? Learning what?

482
00:27:06,695 --> 00:27:10,028
How to be a human
and part of a family.

483
00:27:10,065 --> 00:27:12,260
I think you speak
for a lot of us there.

484
00:27:14,336 --> 00:27:15,963
Um...

485
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:22,372
That's very good.

486
00:27:22,411 --> 00:27:24,311
That's very realistic.

487
00:27:27,716 --> 00:27:31,083
Um, maybe we ought to
pick this up in the morning...

488
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,917
over a bowl of Lucky Charms,
what do you say?

489
00:27:32,955 --> 00:27:35,048
Maybe we should go to bed now.

490
00:27:36,192 --> 00:27:37,181
Yeah, yeah, I saw that.

491
00:27:37,226 --> 00:27:39,194
That's a very good expression.

492
00:28:11,794 --> 00:28:12,783
Yeah?

493
00:28:12,828 --> 00:28:14,853
Yes, Mr. Gordon.
Hi, Mr. Lefkowitz...

494
00:28:14,897 --> 00:28:16,091
- from Children's Services.
- Wh-What? Who?

495
00:28:16,131 --> 00:28:18,599
This is Mr. Lefkowitz
from Children's Services.

496
00:28:18,634 --> 00:28:20,363
Oh, hi. Hello, sir.
How are you?

497
00:28:20,402 --> 00:28:21,562
Well, good.

498
00:28:21,604 --> 00:28:23,196
More to the point, how are you?

499
00:28:23,239 --> 00:28:25,332
Couldn't be better.
Couldn't be better.

500
00:28:25,374 --> 00:28:26,932
Good. How's Dennis?

501
00:28:26,976 --> 00:28:28,341
Is there anything
we should talk about?

502
00:28:30,212 --> 00:28:32,112
Mr. Gordon?

503
00:28:32,147 --> 00:28:33,375
Hello, Mr. Gordon.

504
00:28:33,415 --> 00:28:34,882
Uh, yeah. I'm here.

505
00:28:34,917 --> 00:28:36,942
Yeah, hi. I was asking if... if...

506
00:28:36,986 --> 00:28:38,453
Do you have any
concerns about Dennis...

507
00:28:38,487 --> 00:28:39,647
that you'd like to talk about?

508
00:28:39,688 --> 00:28:41,155
No, no.
Everything's going great.

509
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:42,214
Couldn't be better, sir.

510
00:29:22,064 --> 00:29:23,088
Hmm...

511
00:29:25,801 --> 00:29:27,894
I think it's time to get
you out of the house.

512
00:29:28,837 --> 00:29:31,863
Listen, imagination
is a rare commodity.

513
00:29:31,907 --> 00:29:34,205
Dennis has the soul
of an artist.

514
00:29:34,243 --> 00:29:35,403
He could grow up
to be, you know...

515
00:29:35,444 --> 00:29:37,571
<i>become a prodigy like...
You saw Amadeus.</i>

516
00:29:37,613 --> 00:29:40,343
He could be a little Mozart
in waiting for all you know.

517
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:43,916
Mom, he's being gross.

518
00:29:43,953 --> 00:29:47,047
- Come on.
- Guys, let it go, okay?

519
00:29:47,089 --> 00:29:48,078
Remember?

520
00:29:48,123 --> 00:29:49,886
It all ends up
in the same place, right?

521
00:29:49,925 --> 00:29:51,119
Come on, guys.

522
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:56,621
I mean, I want to be sensitive,
but he's a mess.

523
00:29:56,665 --> 00:29:58,292
Hey, that's sensitive?

524
00:29:58,334 --> 00:29:59,392
You should hear blunt.

525
00:29:59,435 --> 00:30:00,595
No, but really.

526
00:30:00,636 --> 00:30:03,969
Listen, my point is that
not everybody is born to be...

527
00:30:04,006 --> 00:30:06,600
a go-with-the-flow,
happy little Gap-kid.

528
00:30:06,642 --> 00:30:08,075
Right now, it looks like
he's gonna grow up...

529
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:11,045
to be Tiny Tim
with a ukulele, all right?

530
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,605
What, are you
breeding geniuses now?

531
00:30:13,649 --> 00:30:18,814
Mozart, by the way, died
in a hovel at 27, drunk and...

532
00:30:18,854 --> 00:30:21,652
Unspecified fever at 35.

533
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:23,089
Stuff like that.

534
00:30:23,125 --> 00:30:26,219
Sure, we all enjoyed his music,
but did he enjoy himself?

535
00:30:26,261 --> 00:30:27,455
Give me a chance.

536
00:30:27,496 --> 00:30:29,225
You know, David,
as far as I'm concerned...

537
00:30:29,264 --> 00:30:30,754
they're all from Mars.
At least your kid admits it.

538
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:31,788
See, this is a smart man.

539
00:30:31,834 --> 00:30:32,892
That's the correct answer, man.

540
00:30:32,935 --> 00:30:33,993
- Smart man. Right.
- You married a smart man.

541
00:30:34,036 --> 00:30:36,334
I know.
I agree they're all from Mars.

542
00:30:37,539 --> 00:30:39,507
Strike two!

543
00:30:39,541 --> 00:30:40,633
Two and two the count...

544
00:30:40,676 --> 00:30:42,071
as Bobby Miller gets
ready for the pitch.

545
00:30:42,106 --> 00:30:43,467
As Bobby Miller gets
ready for the pitch.

546
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,909
Here we go.

547
00:30:46,948 --> 00:30:48,677
Strike three!

548
00:30:48,717 --> 00:30:50,617
That was a nice strike-out, huh?

549
00:30:50,652 --> 00:30:52,142
It's called a strike-out.

550
00:30:52,187 --> 00:30:54,087
It's pretty cool, huh?
You want a peanut?

551
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:56,014
You know what's really cool
about baseball?

552
00:30:56,057 --> 00:30:57,922
You know what I love
about baseball?

553
00:30:57,959 --> 00:30:59,654
Baseball is the only sport...

554
00:30:59,694 --> 00:31:02,322
where you can fail 70 percent
of the time and still be great.

555
00:31:02,364 --> 00:31:05,128
It's about trying hard and
never, ever, ever givin' up.

556
00:31:05,166 --> 00:31:06,155
Just think about it.

557
00:31:06,201 --> 00:31:07,930
If you get a hit
three out of every 10 times...

558
00:31:07,969 --> 00:31:09,960
you're at bat,
you're really good.

559
00:31:10,005 --> 00:31:11,700
If you do
a little bit better than that...

560
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,264
just a little bit
better than that...

561
00:31:13,308 --> 00:31:15,742
maybe 3.2, 3.3 times...

562
00:31:17,445 --> 00:31:20,505
you're great,
and you could be a star.

563
00:31:20,548 --> 00:31:22,539
And you're gonna make it
to the Big Show.

564
00:31:22,584 --> 00:31:24,051
And if you do that
on the Big Show...

565
00:31:24,085 --> 00:31:25,677
you're a superstar.

566
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,915
Superstars don't exist.

567
00:31:27,956 --> 00:31:31,392
Only supernovas or white dwarfs.

568
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:34,087
I deserve you.

569
00:31:34,129 --> 00:31:35,460
I really do.

570
00:31:38,299 --> 00:31:39,823
You're out.

571
00:31:39,868 --> 00:31:41,563
This guy doesn't look
like much of a hitter.

572
00:31:44,205 --> 00:31:45,729
But we believe, don't we?

573
00:31:47,075 --> 00:31:48,099
Come on, now!

574
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:51,440
Strike three!

575
00:31:51,479 --> 00:31:52,810
It's not lookin' pretty.

576
00:31:52,847 --> 00:31:55,441
We're down by seven runs.

577
00:31:55,483 --> 00:31:56,472
We're not hittin' a lick.

578
00:31:56,518 --> 00:31:57,542
Come on, batter.

579
00:31:57,585 --> 00:31:59,109
We need a hit.

580
00:31:59,154 --> 00:32:00,485
Right on the ball!

581
00:32:01,856 --> 00:32:02,845
Yeah!

582
00:32:02,891 --> 00:32:04,256
There you go.

583
00:32:04,292 --> 00:32:05,919
Got a single.
Get something started.

584
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,484
I did it.

585
00:32:07,529 --> 00:32:08,996
You did what?

586
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:11,089
I made a Martian wish.

587
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,758
You made a...

588
00:32:13,802 --> 00:32:16,032
You made a Martian wish?

589
00:32:16,071 --> 00:32:18,596
Yeah.
Martians can wish for stuff.

590
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,665
Like hits?

591
00:32:20,708 --> 00:32:21,902
Whatever.

592
00:32:21,943 --> 00:32:24,503
You know, sometimes
I make earth wishes...

593
00:32:24,546 --> 00:32:26,036
but they don't always work out.

594
00:32:26,081 --> 00:32:30,211
Well, listen, since
you're in the wishing mode...

595
00:32:30,251 --> 00:32:33,345
see this guy comin' up
to the plate?

596
00:32:33,388 --> 00:32:35,117
Wish for a home run.

597
00:32:42,964 --> 00:32:44,295
Go! Go! Go!

598
00:32:44,332 --> 00:32:47,096
That ball is gone!

599
00:32:50,605 --> 00:32:51,629
Want him to win?

600
00:32:55,343 --> 00:32:57,937
Unbelievable. What
an awesome display of power.

601
00:32:57,979 --> 00:33:00,573
You're a prognosticator,
you're a scholar...

602
00:33:00,615 --> 00:33:03,379
and now you're a baseball
fanatic, and I like it.

603
00:33:03,418 --> 00:33:04,976
...all the way back to 1973.

604
00:33:05,019 --> 00:33:08,511
Let's hear it
for those Coal Miners. Now...

605
00:33:08,556 --> 00:33:11,024
Unbelievable game.

606
00:33:12,994 --> 00:33:15,019
This isn't looking pretty.

607
00:33:15,063 --> 00:33:16,587
Do you know we spend
an average of two weeks...

608
00:33:16,631 --> 00:33:19,759
in a lifetime waiting
for traffic lights?

609
00:33:19,801 --> 00:33:20,995
I remember when
all these lights...

610
00:33:21,035 --> 00:33:23,333
were timed, you know,
when they were synchronized?

611
00:33:23,371 --> 00:33:25,032
And you could just find this
little seam in the universe...

612
00:33:25,073 --> 00:33:27,007
and float through.

613
00:33:30,245 --> 00:33:34,113
Wow. Did you see that?

614
00:33:34,149 --> 00:33:38,711
Yup. I just gave you
three minutes of your life back.

615
00:33:39,854 --> 00:33:42,687
Well, thank you.
I'll use them wisely.

616
00:33:44,592 --> 00:33:45,786
Do that again.

617
00:33:45,827 --> 00:33:47,385
Nope.

618
00:33:47,428 --> 00:33:49,658
Why? 'Cause you don't want to
or 'cause you can't?

619
00:33:49,697 --> 00:33:53,292
I only have
so many Martian wishes.

620
00:33:53,334 --> 00:33:54,699
That's fair.

621
00:33:56,204 --> 00:34:00,038
But if you want,
I can give you one.

622
00:34:02,143 --> 00:34:04,338
Who wouldn't want one?

623
00:34:22,096 --> 00:34:25,588
There, I just gave you
a Martian wish.

624
00:34:25,633 --> 00:34:28,363
Don't waste it.

625
00:34:28,403 --> 00:34:30,598
I absolutely won't. I promise.

626
00:34:30,638 --> 00:34:33,038
I'll use it for something
really important.

627
00:34:35,109 --> 00:34:36,838
That was really intense.

628
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:45,787
You're just a freaky
little dude, man.

629
00:34:45,822 --> 00:34:47,755
Ahem.

630
00:34:47,789 --> 00:34:49,723
Hey, Somewhere.

631
00:34:51,259 --> 00:34:52,726
- This is Harlee.
- Hi.

632
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,557
She's... She's our good friend,
me and Somewhere.

633
00:34:54,596 --> 00:34:57,087
She helped design
this whole garden, so...

634
00:35:01,536 --> 00:35:03,163
Nice frame.

635
00:35:04,505 --> 00:35:05,995
I've heard a lot about you.

636
00:35:07,775 --> 00:35:09,800
You want to say hi?

637
00:35:09,844 --> 00:35:10,970
- No?
- It's okay.

638
00:35:11,012 --> 00:35:12,138
Don't worry. Don't worry.

639
00:35:15,817 --> 00:35:17,307
Isn't he wild?

640
00:35:17,352 --> 00:35:20,583
He's great,
like a little Andy Warhol.

641
00:35:20,622 --> 00:35:23,318
He has the same social skills,
by the way.

642
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,655
You know what I think it is?

643
00:35:27,695 --> 00:35:29,458
What?

644
00:35:29,497 --> 00:35:31,931
He's an old soul.

645
00:35:31,966 --> 00:35:34,560
What does that mean?

646
00:35:34,602 --> 00:35:36,229
Seriously.

647
00:35:36,271 --> 00:35:39,104
It just means
he's figured it out.

648
00:35:41,476 --> 00:35:43,774
You're one relentlessly
sunny individual.

649
00:35:43,811 --> 00:35:45,870
Yeah, well, I don't
always wake up that way.

650
00:35:46,748 --> 00:35:49,342
And that is what
we so admire about you.

651
00:35:49,384 --> 00:35:52,080
This particular move here
that he's got goin'...

652
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:55,612
can't be sanitary or safe.

653
00:35:55,657 --> 00:35:56,783
He likes to vacuum.

654
00:35:56,824 --> 00:35:58,189
No, no, no,
he thinks he is the vacuum.

655
00:35:58,226 --> 00:36:00,990
There's a difference, see?

656
00:36:01,029 --> 00:36:03,463
That's so Zen.

657
00:36:03,498 --> 00:36:04,829
It is, kind of, isn't it?

658
00:36:04,866 --> 00:36:05,924
Yeah.

659
00:36:07,402 --> 00:36:10,064
See? More sunshine.

660
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:15,236
Keep your hips towards me,
though, if you can.

661
00:36:15,276 --> 00:36:16,504
Just move this foot
a little towards me.

662
00:36:16,544 --> 00:36:18,535
No, no, not
that part of your hips.

663
00:36:18,579 --> 00:36:20,046
Just square yourself
up this way.

664
00:36:20,081 --> 00:36:21,105
Right like that, right?

665
00:36:21,149 --> 00:36:22,844
And then hand on the bat...

666
00:36:22,884 --> 00:36:24,374
and, remember,
you're gonna step forward.

667
00:36:24,419 --> 00:36:26,387
When you hit the ball,
you can yell, "Hot coffee!"

668
00:36:26,988 --> 00:36:28,216
Say it.

669
00:36:28,256 --> 00:36:29,245
Hot coffee!

670
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:30,348
Say, "Hot coffee!"

671
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,687
All right, forget it.

672
00:36:33,728 --> 00:36:35,662
Seven out of ten times
you can fail...

673
00:36:35,697 --> 00:36:36,755
but you're still a star.

674
00:36:36,798 --> 00:36:37,822
A little better than that...

675
00:36:37,865 --> 00:36:39,025
you'll go to the Big Show
for a cup of coffee.

676
00:36:39,067 --> 00:36:40,227
I like this game.

677
00:36:40,268 --> 00:36:41,667
I know. It's good, right?

678
00:36:41,703 --> 00:36:43,000
It's a great game.

679
00:36:43,037 --> 00:36:46,165
So, eye on the ball and swing.

680
00:36:46,207 --> 00:36:48,334
That was a little late.

681
00:36:48,376 --> 00:36:50,606
Watch the ball hit the bat.

682
00:36:50,645 --> 00:36:52,738
Watch. Just have your eyes
go right there.

683
00:36:54,882 --> 00:36:56,406
What is with your pitching?

684
00:36:56,451 --> 00:36:57,577
- Here we go.
- Oh!

685
00:36:57,618 --> 00:36:58,607
That was a little too early.

686
00:36:58,653 --> 00:36:59,813
- But it was so good.
- Yeah.

687
00:36:59,854 --> 00:37:00,878
It was a good form.

688
00:37:02,156 --> 00:37:04,351
Almost, Dennis, that was nice.

689
00:37:04,392 --> 00:37:06,189
All right now,
with fierce determination.

690
00:37:10,565 --> 00:37:11,998
Want to see you,
you know, just groove on it.

691
00:37:12,033 --> 00:37:13,364
You know, get a little attitude.

692
00:37:13,401 --> 00:37:14,834
You know, a little swagger.
You touch the plate.

693
00:37:14,869 --> 00:37:16,029
Come on, you're a lefty.

694
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:17,833
You're weird, you're eccentric,
nobody understands you.

695
00:37:17,872 --> 00:37:19,032
You don't
even understand yourself.

696
00:37:19,073 --> 00:37:20,802
You know what I'm sayin'? Yeah.

697
00:37:20,842 --> 00:37:21,866
Yeah.

698
00:37:21,909 --> 00:37:23,934
Yeah, that's what
I'm talkin' about. Yeah.

699
00:37:23,978 --> 00:37:26,242
Now hands back,
give me the eagle eye.

700
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,440
I'm scared.

701
00:37:27,482 --> 00:37:29,245
That's what I'm talkin' about.

702
00:37:30,284 --> 00:37:32,081
Oh! Oh!

703
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,985
Hot coffee!

704
00:37:34,021 --> 00:37:35,613
Hot coffee.

705
00:37:35,656 --> 00:37:38,056
Oh! Hot coffee!

706
00:37:38,092 --> 00:37:39,150
Yeah, you drove it
it down the line.

707
00:37:39,193 --> 00:37:40,990
That's a fair ball! Run!

708
00:37:41,028 --> 00:37:42,290
Run! Run, Dennis!

709
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:43,422
Fair ball! Run!

710
00:37:43,464 --> 00:37:45,694
Drop the bat and run. Run.

711
00:37:45,733 --> 00:37:46,722
Run!

712
00:37:46,768 --> 00:37:48,963
- Dennis, run.
- Go, run! Run!

713
00:37:49,003 --> 00:37:51,028
- Come on!
- Run! Quick!

714
00:37:51,072 --> 00:37:52,266
Come on now.

715
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:56,970
Oh, thank you, sweetie.

716
00:37:59,914 --> 00:38:01,506
What was that for?

717
00:38:01,549 --> 00:38:04,177
'Cause they're giving medals
to all the wrong guys.

718
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:24,531
Hello, my name is Jeff.

719
00:38:27,308 --> 00:38:28,468
Hey, buddy.

720
00:38:29,777 --> 00:38:33,645
I'm a friend of your...
David's...

721
00:38:33,681 --> 00:38:35,205
um, and I have
this present for you.

722
00:38:36,017 --> 00:38:37,609
You're his agent.

723
00:38:37,652 --> 00:38:39,244
Yes, I am.

724
00:38:39,287 --> 00:38:41,448
Wow, that's, pfft, very good.

725
00:38:41,489 --> 00:38:43,013
I'm impressed.

726
00:38:43,057 --> 00:38:45,025
Where is, um, David?

727
00:38:45,059 --> 00:38:46,253
Is he inside?

728
00:38:47,094 --> 00:38:48,254
Is he inside?

729
00:38:48,296 --> 00:38:50,890
Is he writing?
Is he writing inside?

730
00:38:50,932 --> 00:38:52,058
Okay, buddy, listen, I'm...

731
00:38:52,099 --> 00:38:54,465
- Hey, Jeff!
- Hey, buddy, how are ya?

732
00:38:54,502 --> 00:38:56,026
Good to see you.
You met Dennis, huh?

733
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:58,095
Yeah, we've just been
getting to know each other.

734
00:38:58,139 --> 00:38:59,299
If he gets hungry...

735
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:01,535
Lucky Charms
all night long, right?

736
00:39:01,576 --> 00:39:03,942
Lucky Charms.

737
00:39:03,978 --> 00:39:05,138
Knuckles?

738
00:39:05,179 --> 00:39:07,613
He's not...
It takes a while.

739
00:39:07,648 --> 00:39:09,878
Hi. We're gonna go.

740
00:39:09,917 --> 00:39:12,613
See you, buddy.
Nice to see ya.

741
00:39:12,653 --> 00:39:13,642
God, I'm so proud of you, man...

742
00:39:13,688 --> 00:39:15,155
- Yeah.
- Re-entering your life...

743
00:39:15,189 --> 00:39:16,417
fantastic.

744
00:39:16,457 --> 00:39:19,119
It's not going very well.

745
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,060
Buddy, you know what?

746
00:39:21,095 --> 00:39:23,063
There is a long
and proud tradition...

747
00:39:23,097 --> 00:39:24,997
of asking for help
in the form of a nanny.

748
00:39:25,032 --> 00:39:26,021
- No!
- There's absolutely...

749
00:39:26,067 --> 00:39:27,364
No, there's no shame in that.

750
00:39:27,401 --> 00:39:28,527
I'm not talking about...

751
00:39:28,569 --> 00:39:29,900
I'm not talking about Dennis.
He's fine.

752
00:39:29,937 --> 00:39:30,961
I'm talking about, you know...

753
00:39:31,005 --> 00:39:32,267
the book's not going
particularly well.

754
00:39:32,306 --> 00:39:33,500
What... What's, um...

755
00:39:33,541 --> 00:39:34,735
What's going on
with the book?

756
00:39:34,775 --> 00:39:36,743
Does that mean like...

757
00:39:36,777 --> 00:39:37,937
sagging-in-the-middle
not good or what?

758
00:39:37,979 --> 00:39:39,037
- No.
- Like the ending?

759
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,172
You havin' a hard time
noodling the ending?

760
00:39:40,214 --> 00:39:41,374
Can I help you? Is
there anything I can help...

761
00:39:41,415 --> 00:39:42,848
No, no, it's just that
there's an essential idea...

762
00:39:42,884 --> 00:39:43,942
I haven't come to grips with.

763
00:39:43,985 --> 00:39:45,816
But you know the great thing
about Dennis?

764
00:39:45,853 --> 00:39:48,185
He is a fountain of ideas.

765
00:39:48,222 --> 00:39:50,816
He is challenging all
my assumptions, all of them...

766
00:39:50,858 --> 00:39:52,849
every one of them,
and I am going with it.

767
00:39:52,894 --> 00:39:55,886
I just got to learn
to be a little less rigid.

768
00:39:55,930 --> 00:39:56,919
Or a little more rigid.

769
00:39:56,964 --> 00:39:58,727
Yup, it's great.

770
00:39:58,766 --> 00:40:00,393
I'm so excited...

771
00:40:00,434 --> 00:40:02,265
that you're figuring out
the rigidity...

772
00:40:02,303 --> 00:40:04,794
<i>but, buddy, I am livin'
The Revenge of Dracoban...</i>

773
00:40:04,839 --> 00:40:05,863
on a daily basis...

774
00:40:05,907 --> 00:40:08,398
and the forces of darkness
are closin' in on me, man.

775
00:40:08,442 --> 00:40:09,875
Tina's coming to town.

776
00:40:09,911 --> 00:40:11,879
Yeah, she's havin' a big
black tie party for you...

777
00:40:11,913 --> 00:40:12,902
- and she expects you
- Party?

778
00:40:12,947 --> 00:40:14,938
To ritualistically
hand over to her...

779
00:40:14,982 --> 00:40:16,506
the first draft ever written...

780
00:40:16,551 --> 00:40:18,746
<i>of The Revenge of Dracoban
Part Two, the sequel.</i>

781
00:40:18,786 --> 00:40:19,775
When?

782
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,151
About six weeks from now.

783
00:40:21,188 --> 00:40:22,450
You know, so that's it.

784
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:23,479
When?

785
00:40:23,524 --> 00:40:24,616
January 28th.

786
00:40:24,659 --> 00:40:25,990
She's doing it January 28th.

787
00:40:26,027 --> 00:40:28,120
What is the significance
of that date?

788
00:40:28,162 --> 00:40:29,151
I don't know.

789
00:40:29,196 --> 00:40:30,458
She's doing a book signing
or something that night.

790
00:40:30,498 --> 00:40:31,430
The book signing at the...

791
00:40:31,465 --> 00:40:33,592
I got to get a sitter!

792
00:40:33,634 --> 00:40:34,931
Buddy, are you losin' your mind?

793
00:40:34,969 --> 00:40:36,027
No.

794
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:37,230
Because if you are...

795
00:40:37,271 --> 00:40:38,829
I just need
a little bit of lead time.

796
00:40:38,873 --> 00:40:39,897
Don't you think
I deserve that...

797
00:40:39,941 --> 00:40:44,710
- after all these years?
- Don't worry.

798
00:40:44,745 --> 00:40:47,236
You sure you don't want me
to come in with you?

799
00:40:47,281 --> 00:40:48,441
Yes.

800
00:40:48,482 --> 00:40:49,881
Yes, come in?

801
00:40:49,917 --> 00:40:51,782
No. Don't come in.

802
00:40:51,819 --> 00:40:53,377
Don't come in.

803
00:40:53,421 --> 00:40:55,446
You need the umbrella?

804
00:40:55,489 --> 00:40:56,478
Yes.

805
00:40:56,524 --> 00:40:59,357
And the weight belt's
an absolutely essential item?

806
00:40:59,393 --> 00:41:01,520
- # Just let your feelings roll on by #
- Uh-Huh.

807
00:41:01,562 --> 00:41:03,462
Okay. You're gonna have...

808
00:41:03,497 --> 00:41:06,227
- a great first day.
- # Don't wear fear #

809
00:41:06,267 --> 00:41:07,256
# Or nobody will know #

810
00:41:07,301 --> 00:41:09,667
- # You're here #
- Dennis. Dennis. Dennis.

811
00:41:11,038 --> 00:41:13,006
- # Lift your head #
- Listen, just...

812
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,873
# And let your feelings
out instead #

813
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:17,878
Just be yourself.

814
00:41:17,912 --> 00:41:19,209
# Don't be shy #

815
00:41:19,246 --> 00:41:20,611
That's all
you got to do, okay?

816
00:41:20,648 --> 00:41:23,617
# Just let your feelings
roll on by #

817
00:41:23,651 --> 00:41:27,280
# On by #

818
00:41:27,822 --> 00:41:30,620
- # You know love #
- Dennis, Dennis, Dennis, Dennis.

819
00:41:30,658 --> 00:41:33,650
- # Is better than a song #
- That way.

820
00:41:35,463 --> 00:41:41,026
# Love is where
all of us belong #

821
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:45,100
# So don't be shy #

822
00:41:45,139 --> 00:41:48,302
# Just let your feelings
roll on by #

823
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:57,883
Hey, Zack,
you wanna play football?

824
00:41:57,918 --> 00:41:58,907
Hey, retard.

825
00:41:58,953 --> 00:42:00,944
Yeah, we see you.

826
00:42:00,988 --> 00:42:02,353
You little punks.

827
00:42:08,029 --> 00:42:10,657
Sir, is there a problem?

828
00:42:10,698 --> 00:42:11,756
Uh, no, no, no...

829
00:42:11,799 --> 00:42:14,734
not at...
I'm just here to watch.

830
00:42:14,769 --> 00:42:15,861
Yeah, that's a problem.

831
00:42:15,903 --> 00:42:16,961
No, no, no.

832
00:42:17,004 --> 00:42:18,904
This is
a total misunderstanding.

833
00:42:18,939 --> 00:42:21,203
This is not
what it appears to be.

834
00:42:21,242 --> 00:42:23,972
Do you... I'm a new parent.

835
00:42:24,011 --> 00:42:25,000
That... That...

836
00:42:25,046 --> 00:42:26,479
He's my... He's my son...

837
00:42:26,514 --> 00:42:28,072
and it's his first day...

838
00:42:28,115 --> 00:42:29,309
and I was really concerned.

839
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:31,215
I came to
check on my daughter.

840
00:42:31,252 --> 00:42:32,514
Oh.

841
00:42:32,553 --> 00:42:34,714
That's my baby
right there in the brown.

842
00:42:34,755 --> 00:42:36,882
- Driving the, uh...
- Mm-hmm.

843
00:42:36,924 --> 00:42:37,948
Which one's yours?

844
00:42:40,227 --> 00:42:41,922
Over off on the side there...

845
00:42:42,997 --> 00:42:44,021
hanging upside down.

846
00:42:44,065 --> 00:42:45,726
- Weirdo.
- I know.

847
00:42:47,601 --> 00:42:49,228
Good luck to you, sir.

848
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:51,101
Yeah.

849
00:42:51,138 --> 00:42:53,629
He says he's counteracting
earth's gravitational pull...

850
00:42:53,674 --> 00:42:56,768
because it impedes
the blood flow to his brains.

851
00:42:56,811 --> 00:42:58,540
That's what the yogis believe.

852
00:42:58,579 --> 00:43:00,376
Yogis don't have to go
to second grade.

853
00:43:00,414 --> 00:43:02,882
Hey, there's no harm
in being a little eccentric.

854
00:43:02,917 --> 00:43:04,407
This I know.

855
00:43:07,488 --> 00:43:10,321
So, he thinks
he's from Mars...

856
00:43:10,357 --> 00:43:12,882
and you write about Mars,
that's great.

857
00:43:12,927 --> 00:43:16,522
A little Martian chose you
to teach him about being human.

858
00:43:16,564 --> 00:43:19,931
Come on. He came to earth
to document our existence.

859
00:43:22,503 --> 00:43:24,801
<i>Listen, when I was 11 years old,
I saw The Sound of Music...</i>

860
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:26,864
and from that moment on,
I was convinced...

861
00:43:26,907 --> 00:43:29,102
I was the lost
von Trapp sister.

862
00:43:29,143 --> 00:43:30,167
You?

863
00:43:31,746 --> 00:43:34,306
Yeah, but did you go
to school in lederhosen?

864
00:43:34,348 --> 00:43:35,406
Yes, I did.

865
00:43:35,449 --> 00:43:37,508
That's a good look for you.

866
00:43:37,551 --> 00:43:40,111
- He's a sweet little boy...
- Yeah.

867
00:43:40,154 --> 00:43:45,649
But, uh,
he's not like the others.

868
00:43:45,693 --> 00:43:47,422
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

869
00:43:49,463 --> 00:43:50,487
The, uh, social worker says...

870
00:43:50,531 --> 00:43:51,793
he has
above average intelligence...

871
00:43:51,832 --> 00:43:52,821
but, you know, I guess...

872
00:43:52,867 --> 00:43:55,995
it just takes time
for him to adjust.

873
00:43:56,036 --> 00:43:58,300
He steals
from the other children.

874
00:44:00,808 --> 00:44:02,605
Steals?

875
00:44:02,643 --> 00:44:07,342
We find things in his cubby:
Shoes, pencils, retainers.

876
00:44:07,381 --> 00:44:09,713
Um, you know, Dennis
has a really curious mind...

877
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:10,944
and I think
he just really needs...

878
00:44:10,985 --> 00:44:12,953
You know, if it were only...

879
00:44:12,987 --> 00:44:14,579
If it were only
about the stealing...

880
00:44:14,622 --> 00:44:17,716
but Dennis needs
special attention...

881
00:44:17,758 --> 00:44:20,693
that we're simply
not equipped to offer here.

882
00:44:20,728 --> 00:44:22,320
What do you mean
you're not equipped to offer?

883
00:44:23,998 --> 00:44:25,022
I'm sorry.

884
00:44:25,065 --> 00:44:27,056
About what?

885
00:44:27,101 --> 00:44:28,261
What are you saying?

886
00:44:28,302 --> 00:44:29,929
You're saying
you're throwing him out?

887
00:44:37,278 --> 00:44:38,643
Well, that's really...

888
00:44:40,948 --> 00:44:42,916
That's really cold.

889
00:44:46,287 --> 00:44:47,686
- Mr. Gordon.
- Hi.

890
00:44:47,721 --> 00:44:49,655
Dennis and I had
a nice, long chat.

891
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:51,783
Good. How'd that go, pal?

892
00:44:51,826 --> 00:44:53,987
I'm an intelligent being.

893
00:44:54,028 --> 00:44:55,552
I completely agree.

894
00:44:55,596 --> 00:44:56,620
Yeah.

895
00:44:58,365 --> 00:45:00,492
Um, why don't you and I chat?

896
00:45:00,534 --> 00:45:02,331
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You want to wait here?

897
00:45:09,043 --> 00:45:10,738
What do I do for Dennis?

898
00:45:10,778 --> 00:45:12,575
I mean, to...

899
00:45:12,613 --> 00:45:13,705
Do what you're doing.

900
00:45:13,747 --> 00:45:16,716
Just, you know,
you got to give this some time.

901
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:18,650
You know, doctor,
I'm really concerned.

902
00:45:18,686 --> 00:45:21,678
I mean, he's not
making any friends...

903
00:45:21,722 --> 00:45:24,782
and he's not relating
to me particularly well...

904
00:45:24,825 --> 00:45:26,918
and he just got expelled
from school for stealing...

905
00:45:26,961 --> 00:45:28,826
and he's
a very isolated little guy.

906
00:45:28,863 --> 00:45:31,457
And when he, uh, you know,
when he's vulnerable...

907
00:45:31,498 --> 00:45:34,467
and scared like that,
I just...

908
00:45:34,501 --> 00:45:35,525
I mean, when he tells me...

909
00:45:35,569 --> 00:45:37,537
he thinks
he's gonna float away.

910
00:45:39,173 --> 00:45:41,266
He probably thinks
he's gonna float away...

911
00:45:41,308 --> 00:45:43,606
because he's very smart...

912
00:45:43,644 --> 00:45:45,009
and he sees that
he's living in a world...

913
00:45:45,045 --> 00:45:48,344
where things
and people do disappear.

914
00:45:51,418 --> 00:45:55,787
I could give him a prescription,
but, honestly, I...

915
00:45:55,823 --> 00:45:59,691
I think that seeing how
another intelligent being...

916
00:45:59,727 --> 00:46:01,752
keeps his feet on the ground...

917
00:46:01,795 --> 00:46:04,127
would be far more therapeutic
for Dennis.

918
00:46:04,164 --> 00:46:07,190
Mr. Gordon,
all parents feel...

919
00:46:07,234 --> 00:46:10,465
like they're the blind
leading the blind.

920
00:46:10,504 --> 00:46:12,273
Sure.

921
00:46:12,339 --> 00:46:14,637
Listen, pal, I got to talk
to you about something.

922
00:46:14,675 --> 00:46:20,136
Um, after Christmas break,
we're gonna start a new school.

923
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:22,239
And I want to see
how you feel about it...

924
00:46:22,283 --> 00:46:26,014
because that can be kinda scary,
startin' a new school...

925
00:46:26,053 --> 00:46:28,715
and, you know, your teacher
thinks it's a good idea...

926
00:46:28,756 --> 00:46:30,383
and... and... and so do I.

927
00:46:30,424 --> 00:46:33,154
And, um...

928
00:46:33,193 --> 00:46:35,218
Uh...

929
00:46:35,262 --> 00:46:36,889
It's good
to measure things, huh?

930
00:46:38,265 --> 00:46:40,062
Anyway, how do you feel
about it?

931
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:42,227
You okay
to take a fresh start?

932
00:46:42,269 --> 00:46:44,237
Take a fresh run
at a new school?

933
00:46:48,709 --> 00:46:50,438
Would you be up for that?

934
00:46:52,146 --> 00:46:53,408
Hmm?

935
00:46:55,082 --> 00:46:57,448
What are you looking at?

936
00:46:57,484 --> 00:46:59,611
That's where they found me...

937
00:46:59,653 --> 00:47:02,781
on the grass
by the big, round building.

938
00:47:02,823 --> 00:47:04,791
It was raining.

939
00:47:07,061 --> 00:47:09,655
You know what's weird
is that was so long ago...

940
00:47:09,697 --> 00:47:11,722
I would think
you couldn't remember it.

941
00:47:11,765 --> 00:47:14,598
I couldn't, so how could you?

942
00:47:14,635 --> 00:47:17,695
They'll come back
someday to get me.

943
00:47:17,738 --> 00:47:19,603
Like, like summer camp?

944
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:21,130
You don't believe me.

945
00:47:21,175 --> 00:47:25,077
So Martians
can read minds, too, huh?

946
00:47:25,112 --> 00:47:27,979
Martians can do lots
of things you can't.

947
00:47:28,015 --> 00:47:31,815
Besides changing traffic lights,
what can you do?

948
00:47:31,852 --> 00:47:33,251
We can taste color.

949
00:47:34,922 --> 00:47:35,911
Okay.

950
00:47:35,956 --> 00:47:37,719
You can taste color.

951
00:47:37,758 --> 00:47:39,055
Prove it to me.

952
00:47:39,093 --> 00:47:41,118
Off with the glasses,
close your eyes.

953
00:47:46,166 --> 00:47:48,134
They said this would happen.

954
00:47:48,168 --> 00:47:49,362
Open up.

955
00:47:50,671 --> 00:47:53,265
Open... Don't... You were lookin'.

956
00:47:53,307 --> 00:47:55,070
You were totally lookin'.

957
00:47:55,109 --> 00:47:57,771
Right, open up. Here we go.

958
00:47:58,846 --> 00:48:00,108
What color is it?

959
00:48:06,387 --> 00:48:07,411
Red.

960
00:48:07,454 --> 00:48:08,819
All right,
but that one doesn't count...

961
00:48:08,856 --> 00:48:13,054
because we had obvious
ethical complications.

962
00:48:13,093 --> 00:48:14,583
Open up.

963
00:48:21,301 --> 00:48:22,325
Green.

964
00:48:22,369 --> 00:48:24,064
Very good.

965
00:48:27,341 --> 00:48:28,899
Open up.

966
00:48:34,515 --> 00:48:35,573
Yellow.

967
00:48:35,616 --> 00:48:37,049
Yes, it was.

968
00:48:41,722 --> 00:48:42,814
This one?

969
00:48:46,093 --> 00:48:47,617
Well?

970
00:48:47,661 --> 00:48:50,391
I can't taste it.

971
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:51,625
It's blue.

972
00:48:51,665 --> 00:48:54,361
I know.
I can't taste blue.

973
00:49:01,542 --> 00:49:02,975
A little too bright?

974
00:49:04,244 --> 00:49:06,212
Shade it back up.

975
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:14,253
Come, Flomar.

976
00:49:14,288 --> 00:49:16,756
Did you just call Somewhere
"Flomar"?

977
00:49:16,790 --> 00:49:20,021
It's Martian
for "warm, furry friend. "

978
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:22,392
He picked it.

979
00:49:22,429 --> 00:49:23,828
Oh.

980
00:49:28,902 --> 00:49:30,164
All right.

981
00:49:30,204 --> 00:49:31,466
You want to get
a glass of water for you?

982
00:49:31,505 --> 00:49:32,597
- No.
- # Jingle bells #

983
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:34,504
- No, thank you.
# Jingle bells #

984
00:49:34,541 --> 00:49:36,805
Where do you...
Where do you want him to sit?

985
00:49:36,844 --> 00:49:38,334
Hey, it doesn't matter.
Anywhere you want.

986
00:49:38,378 --> 00:49:40,209
Be laissez-faire
about it, right?

987
00:49:40,247 --> 00:49:41,805
Okay, does he have turkey...

988
00:49:41,849 --> 00:49:43,146
or should I get
some Lucky Charms?

989
00:49:43,183 --> 00:49:46,050
I don't know.
Ask boy wonder over there.

990
00:49:47,688 --> 00:49:48,780
Okay.

991
00:49:50,557 --> 00:49:53,526
Hey. Hey, Dennis.

992
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:55,551
Do you want to have
some turkey with us?

993
00:49:55,596 --> 00:49:59,760
I can't eat anything
grown on Saturn's moons.

994
00:50:00,968 --> 00:50:03,027
- Hmm.
- Well, then, I think you're safe here.

995
00:50:03,070 --> 00:50:05,368
That'll be great.

996
00:50:05,405 --> 00:50:07,270
Okay, buddy?

997
00:50:09,543 --> 00:50:15,140
You ever notice how far apart
his eyes are actually set?

998
00:50:15,182 --> 00:50:16,376
No.

999
00:50:16,416 --> 00:50:18,543
Or that his ears are
just a little bit pointy?

1000
00:50:18,585 --> 00:50:19,779
Little bit.

1001
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:21,185
David?

1002
00:50:24,458 --> 00:50:25,550
All this time
I was thinking...

1003
00:50:25,592 --> 00:50:26,684
that I was no good
as a father, right?

1004
00:50:26,727 --> 00:50:27,785
Uh-huh.

1005
00:50:27,828 --> 00:50:29,227
And that, you know,
I was working the Mars...

1006
00:50:29,263 --> 00:50:30,287
as a metaphor angle.

1007
00:50:30,330 --> 00:50:31,729
But then I was
thinking to myself...

1008
00:50:31,765 --> 00:50:33,130
what if that's not it?

1009
00:50:33,166 --> 00:50:36,101
What if he actually
really is imbued, you know...

1010
00:50:36,136 --> 00:50:37,626
with some special...

1011
00:50:37,671 --> 00:50:40,504
You know,
he could be a little medium.

1012
00:50:40,541 --> 00:50:42,099
- David, you're hysterical.
- I know.

1013
00:50:42,142 --> 00:50:44,303
See, everybody says,
"Don't be hysterical. "

1014
00:50:44,344 --> 00:50:45,971
But I say,
"Why not be hysterical?"

1015
00:50:46,013 --> 00:50:48,607
Hysterical is the new calm.

1016
00:50:48,649 --> 00:50:50,446
My wife dies, boom...

1017
00:50:50,484 --> 00:50:52,543
I go out and I adopt
a kid from Neptune.

1018
00:50:52,586 --> 00:50:54,952
Should I just chill,
or should I be hysterical?

1019
00:50:54,988 --> 00:50:56,216
You tell me.

1020
00:50:56,256 --> 00:50:57,985
I think hysteria
is a way of life.

1021
00:50:58,025 --> 00:50:59,492
It's a clothing line
at least.

1022
00:50:59,526 --> 00:51:00,686
I could stop writing...

1023
00:51:00,727 --> 00:51:01,785
not that I'm writing anyway.

1024
00:51:01,828 --> 00:51:05,229
David, I'm...
I'm worrying about you.

1025
00:51:05,265 --> 00:51:06,630
Why?

1026
00:51:06,667 --> 00:51:08,430
Because I think
what's really going on here...

1027
00:51:08,468 --> 00:51:11,631
is you guys
are really struggling.

1028
00:51:11,672 --> 00:51:14,334
You think I don't know that?

1029
00:51:14,374 --> 00:51:16,103
I know that.

1030
00:51:19,479 --> 00:51:22,380
You know, you're still
in a trial period.

1031
00:51:22,416 --> 00:51:24,213
I mean...

1032
00:51:24,251 --> 00:51:27,482
You can return him like
a defective toaster, right?

1033
00:51:27,521 --> 00:51:28,783
Is that what you mean?

1034
00:51:30,457 --> 00:51:34,188
L... I guess what I'm trying
to say is that I...

1035
00:51:34,227 --> 00:51:37,287
I know you see
a lot of yourself in him...

1036
00:51:37,331 --> 00:51:39,526
but, David, I was there.

1037
00:51:39,566 --> 00:51:42,000
You were weird,
and you had problems...

1038
00:51:42,035 --> 00:51:44,902
but this kid
is in a whole other league.

1039
00:51:44,938 --> 00:51:46,565
You know, what is
so amazing about you...

1040
00:51:46,607 --> 00:51:48,700
is that you're right.

1041
00:51:48,742 --> 00:51:50,300
You're always right...

1042
00:51:50,344 --> 00:51:52,039
and you remember
when you're right...

1043
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:54,639
and you never let
anybody else forget it.

1044
00:51:54,681 --> 00:51:56,308
I'm gonna just go out
for a minute.

1045
00:51:58,185 --> 00:51:59,914
Hey, come on, Dennis.

1046
00:51:59,953 --> 00:52:01,215
Let's get out of here.

1047
00:52:01,254 --> 00:52:03,984
Gee, this was fun, huh?

1048
00:52:04,024 --> 00:52:05,389
A little later...

1049
00:52:05,425 --> 00:52:06,824
- David?
- I can make you some Lucky Charms or something.

1050
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:09,055
- David? David, don't.
- That's okay.

1051
00:52:09,096 --> 00:52:11,155
- Come on, it's Christmas.
- Well, you know, whatever.

1052
00:52:11,198 --> 00:52:12,358
- Of course, it is.
- You know?

1053
00:52:12,399 --> 00:52:13,423
Where... Where you going?

1054
00:52:16,737 --> 00:52:18,227
David?

1055
00:52:18,271 --> 00:52:19,329
Come on.

1056
00:52:19,373 --> 00:52:20,465
Hey.

1057
00:52:20,507 --> 00:52:23,169
Come on. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean...

1058
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:24,677
Well, "trial period,"
is that a code?

1059
00:52:24,711 --> 00:52:26,178
- Okay.
- Some kind of code?

1060
00:52:26,213 --> 00:52:27,271
'Cause you said that.

1061
00:52:27,314 --> 00:52:28,713
- I know.
- L... You know what?

1062
00:52:28,749 --> 00:52:29,841
I, I, I...

1063
00:52:29,883 --> 00:52:30,872
Everything's okay.
Everything's cool.

1064
00:52:30,917 --> 00:52:32,407
- I was just trying...
- You know, I'm just tired.

1065
00:52:32,452 --> 00:52:33,441
I'm just tired.

1066
00:52:33,487 --> 00:52:36,149
But it's Christmas, David.

1067
00:52:36,189 --> 00:52:38,316
- No. We'll come over tomorrow.
- Just relax.

1068
00:52:38,358 --> 00:52:39,450
We'll come over tomorrow, okay?

1069
00:54:25,966 --> 00:54:27,160
Dennis!

1070
00:54:28,969 --> 00:54:30,095
Was I bad?

1071
00:54:30,137 --> 00:54:31,729
No, you weren't bad...

1072
00:54:31,772 --> 00:54:33,239
and you got to stop
saying that, all right?

1073
00:54:33,273 --> 00:54:34,797
I don't want you
to cut your feet.

1074
00:54:34,841 --> 00:54:36,968
And Daddy's...

1075
00:54:37,010 --> 00:54:38,272
I'm in here working.

1076
00:54:39,613 --> 00:54:42,514
We got to put this camera away
for a little while, okay?

1077
00:54:42,549 --> 00:54:44,141
But I haven't finished
my mission.

1078
00:54:44,184 --> 00:54:46,675
Well, you have for today.

1079
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:49,587
But I haven't
finished my mission!

1080
00:54:49,623 --> 00:54:51,090
Give me my camera back!

1081
00:54:51,124 --> 00:54:52,250
I need it!

1082
00:54:52,292 --> 00:54:55,125
Hey, you got to calm down.

1083
00:54:55,162 --> 00:54:57,562
I have to go to work,
or you can go to your room.

1084
00:54:58,565 --> 00:55:01,932
You're gonna send me away,
aren't you?

1085
00:55:03,236 --> 00:55:05,067
Dennis,
why would I send you away?

1086
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:11,074
Because you're mad at me
because I broke your stuff.

1087
00:55:12,045 --> 00:55:13,910
Dennis, I don't care
about any of that stuff.

1088
00:55:15,282 --> 00:55:16,613
This is stuff.

1089
00:55:17,851 --> 00:55:19,045
There's nothing you can do...

1090
00:55:19,085 --> 00:55:20,450
that would ever change
the way I feel.

1091
00:55:21,955 --> 00:55:23,081
Do you understand?

1092
00:55:24,524 --> 00:55:26,287
Not gonna ever send you away.

1093
00:55:28,295 --> 00:55:29,956
Look, this is just stuff.

1094
00:55:46,413 --> 00:55:48,313
Come on, break it
like you mean it.

1095
00:55:49,482 --> 00:55:51,245
One more.

1096
00:55:51,284 --> 00:55:52,546
Let it go, buddy.

1097
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:55,913
Here's two. Oh, just one.

1098
00:55:55,956 --> 00:55:57,787
Nice one! Over the head...

1099
00:55:57,824 --> 00:55:58,882
over the head, big time.

1100
00:55:58,925 --> 00:56:01,587
Like the Greeks.

1101
00:56:01,628 --> 00:56:03,823
That feels so good.

1102
00:56:03,864 --> 00:56:04,956
No, not that plate!

1103
00:56:04,998 --> 00:56:06,795
I got an idea,
but we'll still have fun.

1104
00:56:06,833 --> 00:56:08,061
We'll still have fun.

1105
00:56:12,973 --> 00:56:15,066
I'm sorry.
I'm just trying to have...

1106
00:56:15,108 --> 00:56:16,837
I'm just trying to have...
I'm so sorry.

1107
00:56:16,877 --> 00:56:17,935
I was just trying
to have fun, buddy.

1108
00:56:19,312 --> 00:56:20,745
What's that laugh?

1109
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:22,577
Oh, oh, oh!

1110
00:56:29,089 --> 00:56:30,716
Oh, my, oh!

1111
00:56:30,757 --> 00:56:32,190
I will wail on you!

1112
00:56:32,225 --> 00:56:33,817
This is war!

1113
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:35,987
- This is war!
- Whoa!

1114
00:56:36,029 --> 00:56:37,428
Whoa!

1115
00:56:41,668 --> 00:56:43,135
Uh-Oh.

1116
00:56:45,538 --> 00:56:48,302
Uh, just stay here.

1117
00:56:54,481 --> 00:56:55,709
Pss pss...

1118
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:02,483
Hey, Mr. Lefkowitz,
uh, come on in.

1119
00:57:02,522 --> 00:57:05,650
Uh, what a surprise.
Happy holidays.

1120
00:57:05,692 --> 00:57:07,523
Thank you. You, too.

1121
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:11,963
Uh, we were just,
uh, having, uh...

1122
00:57:11,998 --> 00:57:13,124
just having some fun.

1123
00:57:13,166 --> 00:57:14,497
Sort of a, uh...

1124
00:57:14,534 --> 00:57:17,560
It's a breakthrough,
you could say.

1125
00:57:17,604 --> 00:57:18,730
Nice to see you.

1126
00:57:18,772 --> 00:57:22,538
Very, uh, vigilant of you
to come during the holidays.

1127
00:57:22,575 --> 00:57:24,702
I heard there was
a little trouble at school.

1128
00:57:24,744 --> 00:57:27,542
Just a little trouble.

1129
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:29,241
Nothing we can't handle.

1130
00:57:29,282 --> 00:57:30,306
Right?

1131
00:57:30,350 --> 00:57:31,374
Would you mind very much...

1132
00:57:31,418 --> 00:57:33,386
if Dennis and I
went up to his room?

1133
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:34,512
Maybe he could
show me his room.

1134
00:57:34,554 --> 00:57:36,215
We could chat for a bit.

1135
00:57:39,225 --> 00:57:41,557
No, I wouldn't mind.
Would you mind?

1136
00:57:41,594 --> 00:57:43,755
Would that be okay, Dennis?

1137
00:57:46,599 --> 00:57:47,896
I think it's okay with Dennis.

1138
00:57:47,934 --> 00:57:49,231
Good.

1139
00:57:49,269 --> 00:57:50,497
Where's your room, Dennis?

1140
00:57:50,537 --> 00:57:51,526
It's downstairs.

1141
00:57:51,571 --> 00:57:53,436
He'll show you.

1142
00:57:53,473 --> 00:57:54,667
Thank you.

1143
00:57:57,844 --> 00:57:59,368
Following you.

1144
00:58:01,381 --> 00:58:02,405
Everything is...

1145
00:58:09,923 --> 00:58:11,015
Everything all right?

1146
00:58:11,057 --> 00:58:13,082
Hey, you knew
about this stuff?

1147
00:58:13,126 --> 00:58:17,426
Uh, we're just
gonna turn that off real quick.

1148
00:58:17,464 --> 00:58:19,625
Yeah, yeah, sure,
we're, we're, um...

1149
00:58:19,666 --> 00:58:21,395
Have you seen this?

1150
00:58:21,434 --> 00:58:23,265
Yeah, yeah,
I know all about this.

1151
00:58:23,303 --> 00:58:26,136
This is a science project
that we're working on.

1152
00:58:26,172 --> 00:58:27,469
Kind of
a whole transformation...

1153
00:58:27,507 --> 00:58:28,906
and decay kind of a thing.

1154
00:58:28,942 --> 00:58:30,000
We take all the stuff
from the house...

1155
00:58:30,043 --> 00:58:31,067
and we put it
in the baggies.

1156
00:58:31,111 --> 00:58:33,841
We take photos of it,
and we put it away...

1157
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:34,869
then we come back to it.

1158
00:58:34,914 --> 00:58:37,280
Uh, Dennis and I...
Uh, Dennis mostly...

1159
00:58:37,317 --> 00:58:39,114
He'd study how it's...

1160
00:58:40,186 --> 00:58:41,175
See, we're doin'
it right now.

1161
00:58:41,221 --> 00:58:42,210
Car keys.

1162
00:58:42,255 --> 00:58:43,552
- Sure.
- You know, car keys.

1163
00:58:43,590 --> 00:58:45,455
- Yours?
- Yeah, they are.

1164
00:58:45,492 --> 00:58:47,255
Passport, yours?

1165
00:58:47,293 --> 00:58:48,385
I knew about that, too.

1166
00:58:48,428 --> 00:58:50,259
It's amazing how much
a passport can decay.

1167
00:58:50,296 --> 00:58:51,320
Everything's good.
Everything's fine here.

1168
00:58:51,364 --> 00:58:52,388
Everything's great.

1169
00:58:52,432 --> 00:58:54,127
We just try
to do the things and see...

1170
00:58:54,167 --> 00:58:55,862
how they have transformed
and decayed or not.

1171
00:58:55,902 --> 00:58:57,563
- Lf...
- Sometimes they don't.

1172
00:58:57,604 --> 00:58:58,696
We could just talk in private.

1173
00:58:58,738 --> 00:58:59,796
Yeah.

1174
00:58:59,839 --> 00:59:02,740
Good. Excuse us
one second, Dennis.

1175
00:59:02,776 --> 00:59:03,902
Outside.

1176
00:59:03,943 --> 00:59:05,410
Please.

1177
00:59:05,445 --> 00:59:08,471
I'm just a little bit
concerned here, Mr. Gordon.

1178
00:59:08,515 --> 00:59:10,847
You seem to suffer
from a syndrome...

1179
00:59:10,884 --> 00:59:13,114
many adopting parents
experience.

1180
00:59:13,153 --> 00:59:14,484
Shock?

1181
00:59:14,521 --> 00:59:16,250
You're so eager
to become the child's friend...

1182
00:59:16,289 --> 00:59:18,120
you forget to be a parent.

1183
00:59:18,158 --> 00:59:19,853
And Dennis needs
a parent right now.

1184
00:59:19,893 --> 00:59:21,292
He needs a strong role model.

1185
00:59:21,327 --> 00:59:24,319
He needs someone
to bring him down to earth.

1186
00:59:24,364 --> 00:59:26,423
He's been stealing again.

1187
00:59:26,466 --> 00:59:27,865
He's been
expelled from school.

1188
00:59:27,901 --> 00:59:29,300
I think "expelled"
is a harsh word.

1189
00:59:29,335 --> 00:59:31,098
I think there was
a consensus reached...

1190
00:59:31,137 --> 00:59:32,695
that it wasn't
the right place for him.

1191
00:59:32,739 --> 00:59:34,934
Yeah, a consensus includes me.

1192
00:59:34,974 --> 00:59:36,703
The principal
gave me no option.

1193
00:59:36,743 --> 00:59:40,804
L... I should have called,
and I apologize for that.

1194
00:59:40,847 --> 00:59:43,042
I'm gonna move your case up
for a review.

1195
00:59:43,083 --> 00:59:45,449
You'll be notified by mail.

1196
00:59:45,485 --> 00:59:47,680
I'll let myself out.

1197
00:59:51,324 --> 00:59:53,952
Mr. Lefkowitz, I do know...

1198
00:59:53,993 --> 00:59:55,255
that there's no one
on this planet...

1199
00:59:55,295 --> 00:59:58,287
that loves Dennis
any more than I do.

1200
00:59:58,331 --> 00:59:59,855
I know that.

1201
01:00:09,842 --> 01:00:13,073
These pictures are mine.

1202
01:00:14,747 --> 01:00:17,215
And they're
really important to me.

1203
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:20,344
And I need to understand
why you took 'em.

1204
01:00:20,386 --> 01:00:21,717
Will you tell me?

1205
01:00:21,754 --> 01:00:24,314
Please, I need you to tell me.

1206
01:00:24,357 --> 01:00:26,757
Because you love her so much.

1207
01:00:30,396 --> 01:00:31,420
Hmm.

1208
01:00:36,736 --> 01:00:38,533
Ahem, that's really true...

1209
01:00:38,571 --> 01:00:42,667
but that doesn't change
the way I feel about you, pal.

1210
01:00:44,811 --> 01:00:46,210
Not even a little.

1211
01:00:52,352 --> 01:00:54,047
You know,
Mr. Lefkowitz isn't sure...

1212
01:00:54,087 --> 01:00:56,954
that it's such a good idea
that you stay here...

1213
01:00:56,990 --> 01:00:59,015
so we gotta make him happy.

1214
01:01:00,994 --> 01:01:04,327
So when you're here at home,
it's okay to be from Mars.

1215
01:01:05,531 --> 01:01:06,520
But when you're out there...

1216
01:01:06,566 --> 01:01:08,932
with the rest
of the earthlings...

1217
01:01:08,968 --> 01:01:11,027
you know,
you gotta go by earth rules.

1218
01:01:12,238 --> 01:01:18,700
But what we will never do
is we will never, ever...

1219
01:01:18,745 --> 01:01:24,047
ever, ever, ever,
ever give up.

1220
01:01:24,083 --> 01:01:26,313
Winston Churchill said that,
I think.

1221
01:01:28,087 --> 01:01:29,452
There's one other thing.

1222
01:01:29,489 --> 01:01:31,889
It's really serious.

1223
01:01:31,924 --> 01:01:34,518
Will you please teach me...

1224
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:37,222
how to do that
disidney-grate thing?

1225
01:01:39,966 --> 01:01:41,058
How you do it?

1226
01:01:43,136 --> 01:01:44,364
You'll get it.

1227
01:01:56,182 --> 01:01:57,342
We have to do this.

1228
01:01:57,383 --> 01:01:58,509
I can't. You do it.

1229
01:01:58,551 --> 01:02:02,112
I think it should be
this shirt with these.

1230
01:02:02,155 --> 01:02:03,918
Okay.

1231
01:02:05,391 --> 01:02:06,756
It looks hot on you.

1232
01:02:09,128 --> 01:02:10,186
He'll look devastating.

1233
01:02:10,229 --> 01:02:11,719
He will. He will.
That's fine.

1234
01:02:11,764 --> 01:02:14,028
- That's fine.
- Right?

1235
01:02:14,067 --> 01:02:16,228
What age do they start
making fun of you...

1236
01:02:16,269 --> 01:02:17,497
if you wear the wrong clothes?

1237
01:02:17,537 --> 01:02:18,526
- I don't know.
- You know, like, uh...

1238
01:02:18,571 --> 01:02:19,560
if you're not cool.
What... What...

1239
01:02:19,605 --> 01:02:20,594
- Fifth grade?
- Fifth grade?

1240
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:22,073
That's when I started wearing...

1241
01:02:22,108 --> 01:02:25,077
my rainbow-colored
leg warmers every day.

1242
01:02:25,111 --> 01:02:27,875
Pretty much solidified
my role as the weird girl...

1243
01:02:27,914 --> 01:02:28,903
who sat in the back of class...

1244
01:02:28,948 --> 01:02:30,643
drawing Smurfs
until ninth grade.

1245
01:02:33,786 --> 01:02:35,117
But...

1246
01:02:36,189 --> 01:02:37,281
But what?

1247
01:02:38,891 --> 01:02:40,620
Maybe it's
not supposed to be easy.

1248
01:02:40,660 --> 01:02:41,922
I mean, maybe the ones
who have it easy...

1249
01:02:41,961 --> 01:02:43,519
they're missing
part of the adventure.

1250
01:02:43,563 --> 01:02:44,962
Ah.

1251
01:02:44,997 --> 01:02:47,522
Don't you think all the truly
fascinating people...

1252
01:02:47,567 --> 01:02:50,035
in the world probably had
dysfunctional childhoods?

1253
01:02:50,069 --> 01:02:51,297
You sold me.
I'm gonna send him to school...

1254
01:02:51,337 --> 01:02:52,929
in the rainbow-colored
leg warmers.

1255
01:02:52,972 --> 01:02:53,996
- Please don't.
- I will.

1256
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:55,769
I'm not that fascinating.

1257
01:02:58,845 --> 01:03:00,403
Uh, thing about it is...

1258
01:03:00,446 --> 01:03:02,073
I just worry about him
all the time.

1259
01:03:02,115 --> 01:03:03,878
It's the curse
of being a parent.

1260
01:03:05,618 --> 01:03:08,587
I think Dennis is happier
than he's been in a long time.

1261
01:03:08,621 --> 01:03:09,781
Yeah.

1262
01:03:12,792 --> 01:03:14,419
I think you are, too.

1263
01:03:23,803 --> 01:03:24,997
I should go.

1264
01:03:25,037 --> 01:03:26,732
It's late, and I'm tired.

1265
01:03:26,773 --> 01:03:27,762
Do you want me
to make some coffee...

1266
01:03:27,807 --> 01:03:29,900
for the ride home
or something or...

1267
01:03:29,942 --> 01:03:31,466
or you could just stay here.

1268
01:03:32,979 --> 01:03:34,071
In the guest bedroom.

1269
01:03:34,113 --> 01:03:36,274
You don't have a guest bedroom.

1270
01:03:36,315 --> 01:03:37,646
That's right.
Best you were on the couch.

1271
01:03:37,683 --> 01:03:38,707
I didn't... Believe me, that...

1272
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:39,877
That's not what I meant.

1273
01:03:39,919 --> 01:03:40,943
That was the furthest...

1274
01:03:40,987 --> 01:03:43,217
furthest thing from my mind.
Really.

1275
01:03:43,256 --> 01:03:44,553
Oh, really? The furthest?

1276
01:03:44,590 --> 01:03:46,455
Well, not the furthest thing
from my mind.

1277
01:03:46,492 --> 01:03:48,756
There's just things that
are a little further away...

1278
01:03:48,795 --> 01:03:51,127
like smallpox or, you know.

1279
01:03:51,164 --> 01:03:53,291
It's really...

1280
01:03:53,332 --> 01:03:54,390
I gotta go.

1281
01:03:54,433 --> 01:03:56,162
I gotta go feed the goldfish.

1282
01:03:56,202 --> 01:03:57,601
The goldfish?

1283
01:03:57,637 --> 01:03:59,969
I'm taking care
of my neighbor's goldfish.

1284
01:04:00,006 --> 01:04:01,530
Your neighbor's.

1285
01:04:01,574 --> 01:04:02,700
- Yes.
- I see.

1286
01:04:05,011 --> 01:04:06,569
Uh, uh...

1287
01:04:06,612 --> 01:04:08,773
They need to get fed.

1288
01:04:08,815 --> 01:04:10,009
Goldfish, huh?

1289
01:04:19,158 --> 01:04:20,557
- Good night.
- Yeah.

1290
01:04:22,028 --> 01:04:23,120
Uh... oh.

1291
01:04:24,730 --> 01:04:25,958
You okay?

1292
01:04:25,998 --> 01:04:26,987
Uh, yeah. Are you okay?

1293
01:04:27,033 --> 01:04:28,295
I don't know.

1294
01:04:28,334 --> 01:04:30,302
You are. You look okay.

1295
01:04:30,336 --> 01:04:31,530
- So do you.
- Okay. Bye.

1296
01:04:31,571 --> 01:04:32,663
You look great.

1297
01:04:32,705 --> 01:04:33,865
- What?
- You look good.

1298
01:04:33,906 --> 01:04:35,134
Oh, you, too.

1299
01:04:48,521 --> 01:04:50,250
You look great.

1300
01:04:50,289 --> 01:04:51,654
Great.

1301
01:04:52,825 --> 01:04:54,554
It's a cloudy day.

1302
01:04:54,594 --> 01:04:55,788
I know.

1303
01:04:55,828 --> 01:04:58,388
That's why you don't need
all that sun block.

1304
01:04:58,431 --> 01:05:00,296
I do have a little bit
of bad news, though.

1305
01:05:00,333 --> 01:05:03,928
We're gonna have to do
without the holding-down belt.

1306
01:05:03,970 --> 01:05:06,564
But I'll float away.

1307
01:05:06,606 --> 01:05:08,801
I don't know much,
but I know this.

1308
01:05:08,841 --> 01:05:11,571
You will not float away.

1309
01:05:11,611 --> 01:05:12,600
Promise?

1310
01:05:12,645 --> 01:05:13,669
Guarantee it.

1311
01:05:15,348 --> 01:05:16,337
But you know... Come on.

1312
01:05:16,382 --> 01:05:17,906
You know,
what I was gonna tell you is...

1313
01:05:17,950 --> 01:05:19,417
I don't know
if I ever told you this...

1314
01:05:19,452 --> 01:05:22,319
but when I was a kid,
I used to pretend...

1315
01:05:22,355 --> 01:05:24,050
like I was
from another planet.

1316
01:05:24,090 --> 01:05:25,853
Why did you do that?

1317
01:05:25,892 --> 01:05:27,450
Well, I was going
to a new school...

1318
01:05:27,493 --> 01:05:28,517
and I was nervous...

1319
01:05:28,561 --> 01:05:29,858
and I wanted people
to like me...

1320
01:05:29,896 --> 01:05:33,957
and, you know, I was afraid
I wouldn't fit in and...

1321
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,126
Did you wear a hat?

1322
01:05:37,403 --> 01:05:39,337
Um, yeah.

1323
01:05:39,372 --> 01:05:40,498
Yeah, sometimes I did...

1324
01:05:40,539 --> 01:05:41,767
'cause it was Chicago,
and it was cold...

1325
01:05:41,807 --> 01:05:43,104
so sometimes I wore a hat.

1326
01:05:44,877 --> 01:05:47,107
You shouldn't
have worn a hat.

1327
01:05:49,248 --> 01:05:50,476
There it is.

1328
01:05:50,516 --> 01:05:52,609
Well, anyway, after a while...

1329
01:05:52,652 --> 01:05:56,179
I learned to be a little bit
more like everybody else...

1330
01:05:56,222 --> 01:05:57,587
and to fit in a little bit.

1331
01:05:57,623 --> 01:06:00,285
And you know what?
It wasn't so bad.

1332
01:06:00,326 --> 01:06:02,954
It really wasn't so bad.

1333
01:06:02,995 --> 01:06:05,327
Is it good to be
like everyone else?

1334
01:06:06,999 --> 01:06:09,331
That's a really good question.

1335
01:06:09,368 --> 01:06:12,269
Um, which is usually
what adults say...

1336
01:06:12,305 --> 01:06:13,465
when they don't
have the answer.

1337
01:06:15,308 --> 01:06:18,744
I think what's important
right now to remember...

1338
01:06:18,778 --> 01:06:21,269
is that you need
to learn stuff.

1339
01:06:21,314 --> 01:06:22,781
About human beingness.

1340
01:06:22,815 --> 01:06:24,077
Exactly right.

1341
01:06:24,116 --> 01:06:26,311
Instead of, you know...

1342
01:06:26,352 --> 01:06:27,580
Human Martianness.

1343
01:06:27,620 --> 01:06:31,454
Which you already know
a lot about, right?

1344
01:06:31,490 --> 01:06:32,889
- You're welcome.
- Hi, Miss Margie.

1345
01:06:32,925 --> 01:06:34,483
Mr. Gordon, hi.

1346
01:06:34,527 --> 01:06:37,257
Nice to see you.
Do you remember Dennis?

1347
01:06:37,296 --> 01:06:38,888
- Hello, Dennis.
- Miss Margie.

1348
01:06:38,931 --> 01:06:41,365
Don't worry.
We're all very nice here.

1349
01:06:43,636 --> 01:06:46,070
Hey, listen, pal.

1350
01:06:46,105 --> 01:06:48,835
If you feel like you're nervous
or you can't handle it...

1351
01:06:48,874 --> 01:06:50,000
I'm gonna be right out there...

1352
01:06:50,042 --> 01:06:51,703
and you can come get me
in the car.

1353
01:06:55,381 --> 01:06:58,077
What if I don't feel good
after you leave?

1354
01:06:58,117 --> 01:06:59,106
Well, you can come get me.

1355
01:06:59,151 --> 01:07:00,675
I'll be there all day.

1356
01:07:02,655 --> 01:07:04,418
- All day?
- Mm-hmm.

1357
01:07:04,457 --> 01:07:05,822
All day.

1358
01:07:05,858 --> 01:07:08,952
Okay. Your daddy
has to go now, Dennis.

1359
01:07:08,995 --> 01:07:10,019
Okay?

1360
01:07:13,065 --> 01:07:14,999
Okay, here you go, pal.

1361
01:07:16,268 --> 01:07:17,462
We're a little nervous...

1362
01:07:17,503 --> 01:07:19,198
'cause we don't have
our weight belt today.

1363
01:07:20,740 --> 01:07:21,729
We're havin' gravity issues.

1364
01:07:21,774 --> 01:07:23,298
Okay, pal.

1365
01:08:11,424 --> 01:08:13,358
"And the radios crackled
up and down the line...

1366
01:08:13,392 --> 01:08:15,758
"as the fighter lords
received the command...

1367
01:08:15,795 --> 01:08:18,457
"and turned to their soldiers
instructing...

1368
01:08:18,497 --> 01:08:20,658
<i>"Fall where you stand.</i>

1369
01:08:20,699 --> 01:08:23,759
<i>"Fall where you stand. "</i>

1370
01:08:28,441 --> 01:08:31,001
<i>And that is enough
of Dracoban for one night.</i>

1371
01:08:31,043 --> 01:08:34,137
Good night, sweet prince.

1372
01:08:43,322 --> 01:08:48,885
# Shinin' like a work of art #

1373
01:08:50,496 --> 01:08:56,264
# Hangin' on a wall of stars #

1374
01:08:57,536 --> 01:09:03,736
# Are you
what I think you are? #

1375
01:09:09,615 --> 01:09:15,076
# You're my satellite #

1376
01:09:16,722 --> 01:09:23,059
# You're riding
with me tonight #

1377
01:09:23,095 --> 01:09:26,531
# Passenger side,
lighting the sky #

1378
01:09:26,565 --> 01:09:30,968
# Always the first star
that I find #

1379
01:09:31,003 --> 01:09:36,703
# You're my satellite #

1380
01:09:49,822 --> 01:09:55,385
# You're my satellite #

1381
01:09:56,629 --> 01:10:03,762
# You're my satellite #

1382
01:10:05,871 --> 01:10:07,740
Nice talk.

1383
01:10:15,414 --> 01:10:18,248
David!

1384
01:10:18,284 --> 01:10:19,308
Yeah!

1385
01:10:22,588 --> 01:10:23,953
I'm coming!

1386
01:10:28,093 --> 01:10:29,651
Dennis, you okay, pal?
What's wrong?

1387
01:10:29,695 --> 01:10:31,162
What's wrong? What's wrong?

1388
01:10:31,197 --> 01:10:32,824
Flomar.

1389
01:10:36,268 --> 01:10:37,860
Somewhere?

1390
01:10:42,641 --> 01:10:43,699
Ohh.

1391
01:10:43,742 --> 01:10:45,232
What's wrong with him?

1392
01:10:47,379 --> 01:10:48,903
Oh, Somewhere.

1393
01:10:49,848 --> 01:10:51,213
What happened?

1394
01:10:51,250 --> 01:10:52,877
Is he okay?

1395
01:10:55,387 --> 01:10:56,376
No, no.

1396
01:10:56,422 --> 01:10:57,787
He died.

1397
01:10:59,558 --> 01:11:00,650
Died?

1398
01:11:10,669 --> 01:11:11,693
Damn it.

1399
01:11:55,347 --> 01:11:56,336
Hey, let's go for a ride.

1400
01:11:56,382 --> 01:11:57,371
Let's go for a ride.

1401
01:11:57,416 --> 01:11:58,405
Let's get out of here.

1402
01:11:58,450 --> 01:11:59,678
We'll go look at the stars.

1403
01:11:59,718 --> 01:12:01,151
Come on, pal.

1404
01:12:02,488 --> 01:12:03,921
When I was
a little boy like you...

1405
01:12:03,956 --> 01:12:05,651
I used to think
when you lost somebody...

1406
01:12:05,691 --> 01:12:06,851
they would go up there
in the stars...

1407
01:12:06,892 --> 01:12:08,086
and you can't
see 'em anymore...

1408
01:12:08,127 --> 01:12:10,288
but you can talk to 'em,
and they can hear you.

1409
01:12:12,698 --> 01:12:14,131
Is that why
you were crying...

1410
01:12:14,166 --> 01:12:17,431
because you won't see
Flomar anymore?

1411
01:12:19,371 --> 01:12:20,702
When you love somebody...

1412
01:12:20,739 --> 01:12:23,037
it's really hard when
you can't see 'em anymore.

1413
01:12:28,514 --> 01:12:30,243
Do you talk to Mary?

1414
01:12:32,551 --> 01:12:35,543
In a way I do, yeah,
all the time.

1415
01:12:39,091 --> 01:12:40,718
That's probably
why I come out here.

1416
01:12:46,432 --> 01:12:48,332
I can see Mars.

1417
01:12:48,367 --> 01:12:50,597
Get out. Where?
I can't see it.

1418
01:12:51,937 --> 01:12:53,564
Oh, that's a good eye.

1419
01:12:58,410 --> 01:13:00,241
What do you think
of when you see Mars?

1420
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:04,147
That my mission is almost over.

1421
01:13:04,183 --> 01:13:06,151
I'll be going back soon...

1422
01:13:06,185 --> 01:13:08,847
and then everything
will go back to normal.

1423
01:13:10,255 --> 01:13:12,314
Dennis, can I just say
one last thing about Mars...

1424
01:13:12,358 --> 01:13:13,484
which may be strange...

1425
01:13:13,525 --> 01:13:14,856
coming from
a science fiction writer...

1426
01:13:14,893 --> 01:13:16,793
but, right now,
you and me, here...

1427
01:13:16,829 --> 01:13:18,888
put together
entirely from atoms...

1428
01:13:18,931 --> 01:13:23,231
sitting on this round rock
with a core of liquid iron...

1429
01:13:23,268 --> 01:13:27,034
held down by this force, that so
troubles you, called gravity...

1430
01:13:27,072 --> 01:13:28,334
all the while spinning
around the sun...

1431
01:13:28,374 --> 01:13:29,932
at 67,000 miles an hour...

1432
01:13:29,975 --> 01:13:31,738
and whizzing
through the Milky Way...

1433
01:13:31,777 --> 01:13:33,768
at 600,000 miles an hour...

1434
01:13:33,812 --> 01:13:36,804
in a universe that very well
may be chasing its own tail...

1435
01:13:36,849 --> 01:13:39,010
at the speed of light.

1436
01:13:39,051 --> 01:13:41,815
And amidst all
this frantic activity...

1437
01:13:41,854 --> 01:13:43,685
fully cognizant
of our own imminent demise...

1438
01:13:43,722 --> 01:13:44,950
which is a very pretty way
of saying...

1439
01:13:44,990 --> 01:13:48,016
we all know
we're gonna die...

1440
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:50,893
we reach out to one another.

1441
01:13:52,831 --> 01:13:54,560
Sometimes
for the sake of vanity...

1442
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:55,965
sometimes for reasons...

1443
01:13:56,001 --> 01:13:58,265
you're not old enough
to understand yet...

1444
01:13:58,303 --> 01:13:59,531
but a lot of the time...

1445
01:13:59,571 --> 01:14:03,701
we just reach out and
expect nothing in return.

1446
01:14:05,511 --> 01:14:06,944
Isn't that strange?

1447
01:14:08,881 --> 01:14:10,508
Isn't that weird?

1448
01:14:12,551 --> 01:14:14,212
Isn't that weird enough?

1449
01:14:16,688 --> 01:14:19,020
What the heck do you need
to be from Mars for?

1450
01:14:35,541 --> 01:14:38,305
So, look, we're
just gonna talk to 'em...

1451
01:14:38,343 --> 01:14:40,470
and we're gonna tell 'em about
all of the human stuff...

1452
01:14:40,512 --> 01:14:44,812
we like to do,
and, you know...

1453
01:14:44,850 --> 01:14:46,249
it'll be over
before you know it...

1454
01:14:46,285 --> 01:14:49,721
and everything will be fine.

1455
01:14:49,755 --> 01:14:51,120
Okay, deal?

1456
01:14:52,891 --> 01:14:55,382
'Cause if I'm myself...

1457
01:14:55,427 --> 01:14:57,258
they won't let me
to stay with you.

1458
01:15:00,399 --> 01:15:02,230
No. No, no.

1459
01:15:02,267 --> 01:15:03,291
Hey.

1460
01:15:13,512 --> 01:15:15,446
Whatever you say,
it's gonna be okay.

1461
01:15:20,185 --> 01:15:22,210
I love you very, very much.

1462
01:15:25,657 --> 01:15:27,648
Ah, you got
your ankle weights there.

1463
01:15:32,965 --> 01:15:34,023
Be yourself.

1464
01:15:35,367 --> 01:15:38,097
- Come on.
- Hey.

1465
01:15:38,136 --> 01:15:39,467
- Hi, Sophe.
- Hi.

1466
01:15:39,505 --> 01:15:41,769
Okay, come with me, huh?

1467
01:15:41,807 --> 01:15:43,866
It's gonna be okay.

1468
01:15:43,909 --> 01:15:45,433
Let me go get
some coffee here.

1469
01:15:45,477 --> 01:15:47,069
It's all all right.

1470
01:15:55,020 --> 01:15:59,719
So, Dennis, how you
getting along at school?

1471
01:16:01,527 --> 01:16:02,551
Okay.

1472
01:16:03,629 --> 01:16:05,824
Is there something
you want to tell us about?

1473
01:16:07,266 --> 01:16:09,063
No.

1474
01:16:10,736 --> 01:16:13,170
You don't seem
very happy today, Dennis.

1475
01:16:16,408 --> 01:16:18,035
I'm stellar.

1476
01:16:24,750 --> 01:16:27,378
So, um, all this moving
from school to school...

1477
01:16:27,419 --> 01:16:30,081
how... how's... how's that
been for you?

1478
01:16:30,122 --> 01:16:32,852
Mm, there's been
some rough times...

1479
01:16:32,891 --> 01:16:34,381
but the important thing...

1480
01:16:34,426 --> 01:16:38,385
is to, um, you have
to face your problems...

1481
01:16:38,430 --> 01:16:43,060
and you should
never ever, ever, ever...

1482
01:16:43,101 --> 01:16:47,128
ever, ever give up.

1483
01:16:47,172 --> 01:16:50,573
Never ever, ever, ever.

1484
01:16:52,377 --> 01:16:54,470
Winston Churchill said that...

1485
01:16:54,513 --> 01:16:56,674
I think.

1486
01:16:56,715 --> 01:16:59,183
Winston Churchill,
he was a very smart man, huh?

1487
01:17:00,719 --> 01:17:03,449
Hey, Dennis,
when we've spoken before...

1488
01:17:03,488 --> 01:17:05,820
you... you said that you were
from another planet.

1489
01:17:05,857 --> 01:17:06,846
Mars.

1490
01:17:06,892 --> 01:17:08,826
Mars, right.

1491
01:17:08,860 --> 01:17:10,657
<i>Zepper nicki whawok.</i>

1492
01:17:10,696 --> 01:17:12,960
<i>Trans fobo medio.</i>

1493
01:17:19,538 --> 01:17:21,403
Sometimes
it's okay to pretend...

1494
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:24,000
and sometimes it isn't.

1495
01:17:24,042 --> 01:17:26,977
So you...
You were just pretending?

1496
01:17:27,012 --> 01:17:28,570
Uh-huh.

1497
01:17:30,248 --> 01:17:33,183
And then
I started doing science...

1498
01:17:33,218 --> 01:17:37,086
and I realized we were
spinning around the sun...

1499
01:17:37,122 --> 01:17:44,221
at 67,000 miles an hour...

1500
01:17:44,262 --> 01:17:46,457
held in place by gravity.

1501
01:17:46,498 --> 01:17:50,161
So what the heck do I need
to be from Mars for?

1502
01:17:51,136 --> 01:17:53,366
I think it was
because I didn't fit in.

1503
01:17:55,340 --> 01:18:00,073
And then I started to learn
how to be like everyone else.

1504
01:18:02,014 --> 01:18:03,481
Dennis, did, um...

1505
01:18:03,515 --> 01:18:08,782
Did Mr. Gordon coach you
on... on what to say here today?

1506
01:18:08,820 --> 01:18:11,789
He only coached me on one thing.

1507
01:18:11,823 --> 01:18:14,451
What's that?

1508
01:18:14,493 --> 01:18:18,759
If you hit three out of ten,
you're a star.

1509
01:18:18,797 --> 01:18:22,130
If you get even
a little better than that...

1510
01:18:22,167 --> 01:18:25,933
a little better than that,
you're a superstar.

1511
01:18:28,340 --> 01:18:30,672
You get a cup of coffee.

1512
01:18:32,678 --> 01:18:34,509
Hot coffee.

1513
01:18:40,185 --> 01:18:42,210
Well, how'd it... How'd it go?

1514
01:18:42,254 --> 01:18:45,087
I told them about baseball.

1515
01:18:45,123 --> 01:18:46,249
You did?

1516
01:18:46,291 --> 01:18:48,122
Then I told them
about hot coffee.

1517
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:49,787
You didn't? Did you really?

1518
01:18:49,828 --> 01:18:51,853
- Mr. Gordon.
- Yeah?

1519
01:18:51,897 --> 01:18:52,955
Congratulations.

1520
01:18:55,167 --> 01:18:56,156
Thank you.

1521
01:18:56,201 --> 01:18:57,759
I love you.

1522
01:19:05,777 --> 01:19:08,905
Aah!

1523
01:19:08,947 --> 01:19:09,936
- Aah!
- # Sun is shinin' #

1524
01:19:09,981 --> 01:19:12,006
# In the sky #

1525
01:19:12,050 --> 01:19:13,483
- Aah!
- # There ain't a cloud #

1526
01:19:13,518 --> 01:19:14,507
# In sight #

1527
01:19:14,553 --> 01:19:16,214
- Aah!
- # It's stopped rainin' #

1528
01:19:16,254 --> 01:19:18,484
# Everybody's in a play #

1529
01:19:18,523 --> 01:19:20,013
- Aah!
- # And don't you know #

1530
01:19:20,058 --> 01:19:23,619
# It's a beautiful new day #

1531
01:19:23,662 --> 01:19:24,959
- Ooh!
- # Hey, hey, hey #

1532
01:19:24,996 --> 01:19:28,329
# Runnin' down the avenue #

1533
01:19:28,366 --> 01:19:32,393
# See how the sun shines
brightly in the city #

1534
01:19:32,637 --> 01:19:35,606
# On the streets
where once was pity #

1535
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:39,872
# Mr. Blue Sky
is living here today #

1536
01:19:39,911 --> 01:19:42,038
# Hey, hey, hey #

1537
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:43,513
# Mr. Blue Sky #

1538
01:19:43,548 --> 01:19:45,072
# Please tell us why #

1539
01:19:45,117 --> 01:19:48,609
# You had to hide away
for so long #

1540
01:19:48,653 --> 01:19:49,642
# So long #

1541
01:19:49,688 --> 01:19:51,815
# Where did we go wrong? #

1542
01:19:53,125 --> 01:19:54,649
# Mr. Blue Sky #

1543
01:19:54,693 --> 01:19:55,887
# Please tell us why #

1544
01:19:55,927 --> 01:19:59,522
# You had to hide away
for so long #

1545
01:19:59,564 --> 01:20:00,588
# So long #

1546
01:20:00,632 --> 01:20:02,395
# Where did we go wrong? #

1547
01:20:04,169 --> 01:20:06,137
# Hey, you with pretty face #

1548
01:20:06,171 --> 01:20:09,538
# Welcome to the human race #

1549
01:20:09,574 --> 01:20:11,235
# A celebration #

1550
01:20:11,276 --> 01:20:13,710
# Mr. Blue Sky's
up there waitin' #

1551
01:20:13,745 --> 01:20:17,977
# And today is the day
we've waited for #

1552
01:20:18,016 --> 01:20:19,074
# Ah, ah, ah #

1553
01:20:19,117 --> 01:20:20,670
We are
highlighting the search...

1554
01:20:20,685 --> 01:20:24,519
for extra solar planets here
at the observatory.

1555
01:20:24,556 --> 01:20:26,854
And, well, as many of you know,
the Draco system...

1556
01:20:26,892 --> 01:20:29,622
is, uh, the prime focus
of the search.

1557
01:20:29,661 --> 01:20:31,253
And, well, who better
to talk about it...

1558
01:20:31,296 --> 01:20:34,390
<i>than David Gordon, whose
sci-fi best-seller Dracoban...</i>

1559
01:20:34,432 --> 01:20:38,300
has brought this exciting search
into the public eye.

1560
01:20:38,336 --> 01:20:39,394
David.

1561
01:20:39,437 --> 01:20:40,461
Thank you.

1562
01:20:41,506 --> 01:20:45,943
Um, let's see.

1563
01:20:45,977 --> 01:20:47,444
Uh, thank you.

1564
01:20:47,479 --> 01:20:49,811
I was fascinated
with seeing Draconis...

1565
01:20:49,848 --> 01:20:52,214
because it was a system...

1566
01:20:52,250 --> 01:20:54,582
that could closely mirror
our solar system...

1567
01:20:54,619 --> 01:20:56,553
and might produce
a planet like Earth.

1568
01:20:56,588 --> 01:20:58,055
No planet has been...

1569
01:20:58,089 --> 01:21:01,422
the subject of more romantic
speculation than Mars.

1570
01:21:01,459 --> 01:21:03,950
At one point,
it was commonly believed...

1571
01:21:03,995 --> 01:21:07,158
that Mars was inhabited
by an ancient civilization...

1572
01:21:07,199 --> 01:21:10,293
that had dug an intricate
system of irrigation channels...

1573
01:21:10,335 --> 01:21:12,326
and the annual darkening
of the planet...

1574
01:21:12,370 --> 01:21:15,806
was interpreted as the growing
season of plant life.

1575
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:19,241
<i>But the flyby missions
of Mariner IV, VI, and Vll...</i>

1576
01:21:19,277 --> 01:21:21,370
showed that
the irrigation system...

1577
01:21:21,413 --> 01:21:24,712
was nothing but an enormous
network of canyons...

1578
01:21:24,749 --> 01:21:27,741
and the famous darkening
due to annual dust storms.

1579
01:21:27,786 --> 01:21:31,051
<i>Soil samples taken
by the Viking landers...</i>

1580
01:21:31,089 --> 01:21:33,421
showed a complete absence
of organic material...

1581
01:21:33,458 --> 01:21:34,925
from the planet's surface.

1582
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:37,986
In other words,
there is no life on Mars.

1583
01:21:40,599 --> 01:21:42,362
No planet
has been the subject...

1584
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:45,392
of more romantic
speculation than Mars.

1585
01:21:45,437 --> 01:21:47,928
At one point,
it was commonly believed...

1586
01:21:47,973 --> 01:21:51,170
that Mars was inhabited
by an ancient civilization...

1587
01:21:51,209 --> 01:21:53,973
that had dug an intricate system
of irrigation channels...

1588
01:21:54,012 --> 01:21:56,310
and the annual darkening
of the planet...

1589
01:21:56,348 --> 01:21:59,340
was interpreted as the growing
season of plant life.

1590
01:21:59,384 --> 01:22:00,817
But the flyby missions...

1591
01:22:00,852 --> 01:22:03,150
This is not how I remember it.

1592
01:22:03,188 --> 01:22:05,554
...showed that the irrigation system...
- This isn't it.

1593
01:22:05,590 --> 01:22:08,184
Was nothing but an enormous
network of canyons...

1594
01:22:08,226 --> 01:22:11,627
and the famous darkening
due to annual dust storms.

1595
01:22:11,663 --> 01:22:13,528
Soil samples taken by...

1596
01:22:13,565 --> 01:22:17,092
I think
I'm from a different Mars.

1597
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:23,735
Are you angry with me?

1598
01:22:23,775 --> 01:22:26,073
No, I'm not angry with you,
I just thought we agreed...

1599
01:22:26,111 --> 01:22:28,705
that you weren't...

1600
01:22:28,747 --> 01:22:30,009
gonna be from Mars.

1601
01:22:30,048 --> 01:22:31,811
I can't even say
that word anymore.

1602
01:22:33,218 --> 01:22:36,210
I thought I was pretending
so we could stay together.

1603
01:22:36,254 --> 01:22:38,745
No. Come on, pal.

1604
01:22:40,025 --> 01:22:41,720
You don't believe
I am from Mars...

1605
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:42,818
- do you?
- Oh, come on, Dennis...

1606
01:22:42,861 --> 01:22:45,728
I think that sometimes
you think you are, okay?

1607
01:22:45,764 --> 01:22:47,231
Stop!

1608
01:22:47,265 --> 01:22:48,289
No, no. You stop, Dennis.

1609
01:22:48,333 --> 01:22:49,391
- I mean, it's...
- The car!

1610
01:22:56,941 --> 01:22:58,533
I'm so sorry, officer.

1611
01:22:58,576 --> 01:23:00,168
I was having a conversation
with my son...

1612
01:23:00,211 --> 01:23:01,644
and I didn't...
I turned the corner.

1613
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:03,113
I'm really sorry.

1614
01:23:03,148 --> 01:23:04,445
Driver's license, please.

1615
01:23:04,482 --> 01:23:06,177
I usually have it right here.

1616
01:23:06,217 --> 01:23:07,241
Um...

1617
01:23:09,721 --> 01:23:11,814
Dennis, did you take
my driver's license?

1618
01:23:13,325 --> 01:23:15,259
<i>Freena wobbly meetya.</i>

1619
01:23:17,128 --> 01:23:18,356
Dennis, I'm asking you
a question.

1620
01:23:18,396 --> 01:23:19,693
I need you to answer me.

1621
01:23:19,731 --> 01:23:21,289
Did you take
my driver's license?

1622
01:23:21,333 --> 01:23:22,960
This is serious, okay?

1623
01:23:23,001 --> 01:23:24,628
<i>Freena wobbly meetya.</i>

1624
01:23:24,669 --> 01:23:27,194
Dennis! Answer the question!

1625
01:23:27,238 --> 01:23:29,729
<i>Freena wobbly meetya.</i>

1626
01:23:29,774 --> 01:23:30,968
Dennis, you took my license!

1627
01:23:31,009 --> 01:23:32,670
No, I didn't!

1628
01:23:33,812 --> 01:23:34,972
Dennis!

1629
01:23:36,481 --> 01:23:38,574
I didn't steal it!

1630
01:23:46,725 --> 01:23:48,215
What did you do
with her pictures?

1631
01:23:48,259 --> 01:23:50,489
I didn't steal 'em.
I need them.

1632
01:23:50,528 --> 01:23:51,927
Oh, come on, man!

1633
01:23:51,963 --> 01:23:53,521
That's not fair!

1634
01:23:53,565 --> 01:23:54,930
We talked about all this!

1635
01:23:54,966 --> 01:23:56,194
Stop. Those are mine.

1636
01:23:56,234 --> 01:23:57,565
It's not your stuff, Dennis!

1637
01:23:57,602 --> 01:23:59,399
It's my stuff!

1638
01:23:59,437 --> 01:24:00,870
Stop.

1639
01:24:00,905 --> 01:24:04,500
Dennis, adults
get their feelings hurt...

1640
01:24:04,542 --> 01:24:06,032
just like little boys.

1641
01:24:06,077 --> 01:24:07,977
This is my stuff.

1642
01:24:09,180 --> 01:24:10,647
Stop.

1643
01:24:10,682 --> 01:24:12,240
No!

1644
01:24:12,283 --> 01:24:13,341
Stop!

1645
01:24:20,024 --> 01:24:23,651
Go ahead.

1646
01:24:23,695 --> 01:24:24,753
Why don't you?

1647
01:24:28,199 --> 01:24:51,778
<i>Trans fobo medio.</i>

1648
01:24:51,823 --> 01:24:52,812
<i>- Dennis, Dennis.
- Trans fobo medio.</i>

1649
01:24:52,857 --> 01:24:55,155
<i>- Dennis, Dennis, stop.
- Trans fobo medio.</i>

1650
01:24:55,193 --> 01:24:58,720
You're not a Martian.
You're just a little boy.

1651
01:25:04,269 --> 01:25:05,293
And maybe I can't help you.

1652
01:25:05,336 --> 01:25:06,894
Maybe I'm not cut out for this.

1653
01:25:11,376 --> 01:25:14,436
Stay here and just...
Just cool out for a minute.

1654
01:25:31,362 --> 01:25:32,920
Look, it's just
gonna be like, you know...

1655
01:25:32,964 --> 01:25:33,953
I'm gonna show my face
for twenty minutes...

1656
01:25:33,998 --> 01:25:35,329
- Yeah.
- Hey, no.

1657
01:25:35,366 --> 01:25:36,833
- Then get back on the road.
- No, take your time.

1658
01:25:36,868 --> 01:25:37,857
Take your time.

1659
01:25:37,902 --> 01:25:39,233
Do what you gotta do,
you know?

1660
01:25:39,270 --> 01:25:40,259
Don't worry about us.

1661
01:25:40,305 --> 01:25:41,294
Okay.

1662
01:25:41,339 --> 01:25:42,363
It'll be great.

1663
01:25:42,407 --> 01:25:44,034
Thanks for watching him.

1664
01:25:44,075 --> 01:25:45,372
Oh. It's...

1665
01:25:46,444 --> 01:25:47,672
You're my brother.

1666
01:25:48,913 --> 01:25:50,574
He's my nephew.

1667
01:25:56,087 --> 01:25:57,816
Dennis?

1668
01:25:57,856 --> 01:26:00,051
Hey, wow. That is cool.

1669
01:26:00,091 --> 01:26:02,992
Listen, I'm gonna finish
cleaning up the kitchen...

1670
01:26:03,027 --> 01:26:05,495
and call Nicholas and Jonas
and check in on them...

1671
01:26:05,530 --> 01:26:07,225
and I thought
then I can come back...

1672
01:26:07,265 --> 01:26:09,495
and hang out, okay?

1673
01:26:09,534 --> 01:26:11,593
All right, big guy?

1674
01:26:11,636 --> 01:26:12,762
I'll be back.

1675
01:26:16,174 --> 01:26:17,505
Congratulations.

1676
01:26:17,542 --> 01:26:18,975
Who is this handsome fellow?

1677
01:26:19,010 --> 01:26:20,409
I look like Chairman Mao.

1678
01:26:20,445 --> 01:26:22,379
That's right. You brought
your Little Red Book.

1679
01:26:22,413 --> 01:26:24,540
- Oh, that's hideous.
- Louie. Louis?

1680
01:26:24,582 --> 01:26:26,049
Louie, right here, snappy snap.

1681
01:26:29,754 --> 01:26:32,416
Welcome to the big time,
Mr. Gordon.

1682
01:26:32,457 --> 01:26:35,551
Tina. So excited.

1683
01:26:35,593 --> 01:26:36,855
- I was wondering about you.
- So lovely to see you.

1684
01:26:36,895 --> 01:26:38,123
Ah, you wouldn't be the first.

1685
01:26:39,197 --> 01:26:42,462
Everybody,
this is David Gordon...

1686
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:44,832
and he is brilliant.

1687
01:26:49,674 --> 01:26:51,608
And I see he's brought
me a little present.

1688
01:26:51,643 --> 01:26:54,305
This is the first draft
of his new book.

1689
01:26:54,345 --> 01:26:56,142
And let me tell you,
it did not come cheap.

1690
01:26:58,716 --> 01:26:59,705
- Ah, David.
- Yeah?

1691
01:26:59,751 --> 01:27:01,378
I'd like to introduce you
to Leonard.

1692
01:27:01,419 --> 01:27:03,182
He's the head of our marketing.

1693
01:27:03,221 --> 01:27:04,620
Nice to meet you.

1694
01:27:04,656 --> 01:27:05,782
He's absolutely brilliant.

1695
01:27:05,823 --> 01:27:07,381
- Yeah?
- Welcome to the club.

1696
01:27:07,425 --> 01:27:09,586
Tina likes to surround herself
with brilliant people.

1697
01:27:09,627 --> 01:27:11,424
I can see that.

1698
01:27:11,462 --> 01:27:14,090
Well, shall we just give
this manuscript...

1699
01:27:14,132 --> 01:27:16,123
to my assistant
for safekeeping?

1700
01:27:16,167 --> 01:27:17,429
Linus.

1701
01:27:17,468 --> 01:27:19,095
Tina, actually,
could I speak with you...

1702
01:27:19,137 --> 01:27:20,468
in private for a moment?

1703
01:27:20,505 --> 01:27:23,303
There's just... I have something
I need to talk to you about.

1704
01:27:24,509 --> 01:27:27,205
Uh, listen, this might be
a little awkward.

1705
01:27:27,245 --> 01:27:28,974
That's my least favorite word.

1706
01:27:29,013 --> 01:27:30,275
I'm sure.

1707
01:27:30,315 --> 01:27:31,714
Uh, well, could you
take a look at this?

1708
01:27:31,749 --> 01:27:34,047
I just want to talk to you
'cause it's a little...

1709
01:27:34,085 --> 01:27:36,349
different situation here
than I imagined.

1710
01:27:36,387 --> 01:27:37,718
<i>- Martian Child?
- Mm-Hmm.</i>

1711
01:27:37,755 --> 01:27:38,847
What's this?

1712
01:27:38,890 --> 01:27:39,879
Is that the alternate, uh...

1713
01:27:39,924 --> 01:27:40,913
alternate title idea, buddy?

1714
01:27:40,959 --> 01:27:43,018
<i>I thought we agreed
on The Revenge of Dracoban.</i>

1715
01:27:43,061 --> 01:27:44,255
Yes. Yes, we did.

1716
01:27:44,295 --> 01:27:45,455
Um...

1717
01:27:46,698 --> 01:27:49,861
but I must say it's more
than just a title change.

1718
01:27:49,901 --> 01:27:52,665
So this is the, um,
quantum alternate universe?

1719
01:27:52,704 --> 01:27:53,864
Shut up.

1720
01:27:53,905 --> 01:27:54,894
An idea that...

1721
01:27:54,939 --> 01:27:55,928
<i>I tried to write Dracoban.</i>

1722
01:27:55,974 --> 01:27:56,998
I really, really, really did.

1723
01:27:58,076 --> 01:27:59,065
Well, what's the problem?

1724
01:27:59,110 --> 01:28:00,771
I adopted a boy.

1725
01:28:00,812 --> 01:28:06,250
Adopted this very fantastic,
difficult young man...

1726
01:28:06,284 --> 01:28:07,478
and he is very much alive...

1727
01:28:07,518 --> 01:28:09,179
and those characters were dead,
and I had to do this.

1728
01:28:09,220 --> 01:28:11,450
- No, we have a contract.
- Uh-huh.

1729
01:28:11,489 --> 01:28:13,719
We paid you
a substantial amount.

1730
01:28:13,758 --> 01:28:15,157
I know, I know,
I know, I know.

1731
01:28:15,193 --> 01:28:16,785
And I'II, um, ahem...

1732
01:28:16,828 --> 01:28:19,194
I'll write the other one,
or I'll just pay you back.

1733
01:28:19,230 --> 01:28:20,720
It's unacceptable.

1734
01:28:20,765 --> 01:28:21,789
I'll refinance my house
if that's what it takes.

1735
01:28:21,833 --> 01:28:22,822
I don't care.

1736
01:28:22,867 --> 01:28:24,198
I don't want the money.

1737
01:28:24,235 --> 01:28:26,294
I want
a Harry bloody Potter in space.

1738
01:28:26,337 --> 01:28:28,202
That's what I paid for.

1739
01:28:28,239 --> 01:28:30,639
Leonard created
an extremely expensive...

1740
01:28:30,675 --> 01:28:32,905
marketing campaign
around this book...

1741
01:28:32,944 --> 01:28:35,742
<i>and Dracoban is the cornerstone
of that campaign.</i>

1742
01:28:37,448 --> 01:28:39,575
I can't do anything
without that.

1743
01:28:39,617 --> 01:28:44,020
Do you comprehend
what I am telling you?

1744
01:28:44,055 --> 01:28:45,044
You get that, don't you, buddy?

1745
01:28:45,089 --> 01:28:46,249
Do you understand that?

1746
01:28:47,959 --> 01:28:51,918
Why can't you just be
what we want you to be?

1747
01:29:06,344 --> 01:29:08,312
Mmm...

1748
01:29:08,346 --> 01:29:09,438
I got it.

1749
01:29:10,581 --> 01:29:13,141
Beware. Beware. Beware.

1750
01:29:14,786 --> 01:29:17,186
What time is it?
I'm so sorry.

1751
01:29:17,221 --> 01:29:18,381
I'm gonna write the other thing.

1752
01:29:18,423 --> 01:29:20,857
I'm gonna make
this up to you, I promise.

1753
01:29:20,892 --> 01:29:23,258
You're gonna get a whole series,
rivers of blood...

1754
01:29:23,294 --> 01:29:24,625
but just read that
because it's good.

1755
01:29:24,662 --> 01:29:25,822
It's really good.

1756
01:29:25,863 --> 01:29:27,922
And I have to go,
but this was great...

1757
01:29:27,965 --> 01:29:29,227
and I'm sorry.

1758
01:29:39,610 --> 01:29:41,373
Hey, Dennis!

1759
01:29:41,412 --> 01:29:43,744
What do you say, um...

1760
01:29:43,781 --> 01:29:48,548
to some hot chocolate
or... or somethin'?

1761
01:29:48,586 --> 01:29:50,577
Does that sound kinda good?

1762
01:29:52,090 --> 01:29:55,025
Or... Tang?

1763
01:29:55,059 --> 01:29:57,584
Do you know what Tang is?

1764
01:29:57,628 --> 01:30:01,189
It's... It's something
that the astronauts drink.

1765
01:30:01,232 --> 01:30:02,290
Might like that.

1766
01:30:19,985 --> 01:30:21,850
Liz!

1767
01:30:25,991 --> 01:30:28,920
Liz!

1768
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:30,188
- We just...
- What happened?

1769
01:30:30,228 --> 01:30:31,559
We just can't find him.

1770
01:30:31,596 --> 01:30:32,756
You can't find him?

1771
01:30:32,797 --> 01:30:33,957
He was fine.
Everything was fine.

1772
01:30:33,999 --> 01:30:35,830
He was in his room,
and I... I went to get him...

1773
01:30:35,867 --> 01:30:36,891
- some hot chocolate.
- It's okay, it's okay.

1774
01:30:36,935 --> 01:30:38,402
It's okay. It's okay.

1775
01:30:38,436 --> 01:30:39,425
Then we
just called the police...

1776
01:30:39,471 --> 01:30:40,495
- just to make sure.
- Where... Where's...

1777
01:30:40,538 --> 01:30:42,165
Where's the last place
you saw him?

1778
01:30:50,882 --> 01:30:52,247
He's nowhere in the house.

1779
01:30:52,284 --> 01:30:54,775
Are you sure?
You checked everywhere?

1780
01:31:08,033 --> 01:31:10,365
It's so beautiful.

1781
01:31:10,402 --> 01:31:12,768
Maybe he is a little Mozart.

1782
01:31:18,543 --> 01:31:19,874
What does it mean?

1783
01:31:23,381 --> 01:31:24,507
Means goodbye.

1784
01:31:25,817 --> 01:31:28,183
Hey, Harlee, just stay there.
Stay in the car, okay?

1785
01:31:28,219 --> 01:31:29,618
Did you find him?

1786
01:31:29,654 --> 01:31:31,747
No, no, but I know where to go.
Can you drive me?

1787
01:31:31,790 --> 01:31:32,814
- Yes.
- All right.

1788
01:31:32,857 --> 01:31:35,587
I can get the police
to move their car.

1789
01:31:35,627 --> 01:31:36,616
No. Don't worry about it.

1790
01:31:36,661 --> 01:31:37,650
- Okay.
- Okay.

1791
01:31:37,696 --> 01:31:38,685
All right. Call me.

1792
01:31:38,730 --> 01:31:41,198
Put your seat belts on!

1793
01:31:47,472 --> 01:31:48,496
- You go that way, and I'Il...
- David.

1794
01:31:53,945 --> 01:31:55,310
Talk to him.
Go, go, go, go.

1795
01:31:57,849 --> 01:31:59,248
Dennis, stay where you are!

1796
01:31:59,284 --> 01:32:01,650
David's coming to get you...

1797
01:32:01,686 --> 01:32:03,677
so just don't move, okay?

1798
01:32:33,351 --> 01:32:34,750
Don't... Really,
just don't walk, sweetie.

1799
01:32:34,786 --> 01:32:36,879
You gotta just try
to stay still.

1800
01:32:43,361 --> 01:32:44,726
Dennis.

1801
01:32:49,901 --> 01:32:51,459
Dennis?

1802
01:32:51,503 --> 01:32:52,765
Dennis. Dennis, stop movin'.

1803
01:32:52,804 --> 01:32:53,998
Here I come.

1804
01:32:54,038 --> 01:32:55,369
Dennis, I'm comin' to get you.

1805
01:32:55,407 --> 01:32:58,638
Just... Just... Just stay still.
Please, please.

1806
01:32:58,676 --> 01:33:00,735
Dennis, stop movin'.

1807
01:33:00,779 --> 01:33:02,371
They're here.

1808
01:33:05,150 --> 01:33:08,517
Dennis, hold on, pal!
I'm comin'!

1809
01:33:08,553 --> 01:33:11,181
Why are you here?

1810
01:33:11,222 --> 01:33:14,020
You can't come with me.

1811
01:33:14,058 --> 01:33:15,116
Okay.

1812
01:33:15,160 --> 01:33:16,684
Shh.

1813
01:33:19,297 --> 01:33:20,855
Give me your hand.
I'm gonna take you home.

1814
01:33:20,899 --> 01:33:24,767
No. I have to go back now.

1815
01:33:26,070 --> 01:33:27,264
My mission is over.

1816
01:33:29,441 --> 01:33:30,465
Dennis, stop.

1817
01:33:30,508 --> 01:33:32,738
Please stop moving.

1818
01:33:34,245 --> 01:33:37,510
They're here.
They came back for me.

1819
01:33:37,549 --> 01:33:38,538
It's a helicopter, Dennis.

1820
01:33:38,583 --> 01:33:39,811
We've all been lookin' for you.

1821
01:33:39,851 --> 01:33:42,411
It's not a helicopter.
It's not.

1822
01:33:45,490 --> 01:33:47,390
Okay.
Dennis, give me your hand.

1823
01:33:47,425 --> 01:33:48,483
I'm gonna take you home.

1824
01:33:48,526 --> 01:33:50,926
<i>I am going home.</i>

1825
01:33:50,962 --> 01:33:52,759
I don't belong here.

1826
01:33:52,797 --> 01:33:54,162
Okay.

1827
01:34:00,071 --> 01:34:02,096
Put the suitcase down...

1828
01:34:02,140 --> 01:34:05,234
and hold onto the edges
really tight...

1829
01:34:05,276 --> 01:34:07,836
and I'll wait with you
until they come, okay?

1830
01:34:19,557 --> 01:34:21,218
I'm sorry, David.

1831
01:34:22,894 --> 01:34:24,862
What are you sorry about?

1832
01:34:24,896 --> 01:34:27,694
I'm sorry
that I have to leave...

1833
01:34:27,732 --> 01:34:33,500
but I'll tell them
about baseball...

1834
01:34:33,538 --> 01:34:35,472
and Lucky Charms...

1835
01:34:37,909 --> 01:34:40,173
and Flomar.

1836
01:34:40,211 --> 01:34:44,443
Yeah. You can tell 'em
about all the stuff we did...

1837
01:34:44,482 --> 01:34:46,177
and how much fun we had.

1838
01:34:49,988 --> 01:34:51,353
Dennis, look at me.

1839
01:34:51,389 --> 01:34:52,515
Tell 'em about
all the fun stuff we did...

1840
01:34:52,557 --> 01:34:55,117
and, you know,
how much fun we had.

1841
01:34:55,159 --> 01:34:59,118
You can tell 'em
how hard you tried...

1842
01:34:59,163 --> 01:35:01,097
you know, to fit in,
to be like all of us.

1843
01:35:02,967 --> 01:35:06,494
Human beings
can be kinda cruel...

1844
01:35:06,538 --> 01:35:07,562
huh?

1845
01:35:11,676 --> 01:35:14,975
I promise I'll tell 'em
you were nice to me.

1846
01:35:15,013 --> 01:35:16,139
Thanks.

1847
01:35:18,983 --> 01:35:20,245
You're a great human, Dennis.

1848
01:35:20,285 --> 01:35:21,616
That's the funny part...

1849
01:35:21,653 --> 01:35:24,178
and I just wanted you to feel
like you belong to me...

1850
01:35:24,222 --> 01:35:25,211
'cause that's what I think...

1851
01:35:25,256 --> 01:35:26,917
you really want
underneath all this.

1852
01:35:26,958 --> 01:35:28,653
I think you want
to belong to someone.

1853
01:35:32,463 --> 01:35:35,091
I wish we could have
more time together.

1854
01:35:35,133 --> 01:35:36,327
I want to prove to you...

1855
01:35:36,367 --> 01:35:38,301
that not all parents
disappear forever.

1856
01:35:45,710 --> 01:35:48,406
Why do they go sometimes?

1857
01:35:50,982 --> 01:35:52,745
I don't know. That's a...

1858
01:35:57,555 --> 01:35:58,749
I don't know.

1859
01:35:58,790 --> 01:36:00,087
That's a mystery.

1860
01:36:00,124 --> 01:36:02,251
Sometimes it's their fault,
and sometimes it's not.

1861
01:36:02,293 --> 01:36:04,284
It's a... It's a mystery.
I don't know.

1862
01:36:18,176 --> 01:36:20,667
Why? Why?

1863
01:36:22,213 --> 01:36:24,943
Why do you think they left me?

1864
01:36:42,667 --> 01:36:44,328
Because...

1865
01:36:47,205 --> 01:36:48,604
Because they were stupid!

1866
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:50,267
Whoever let you go...

1867
01:36:50,308 --> 01:36:52,799
those were the stupidest beings
in the universe.

1868
01:36:52,844 --> 01:36:54,175
I mean, they were so dumb...

1869
01:36:54,212 --> 01:36:57,045
they couldn't even see
what was right in front of 'em.

1870
01:36:57,081 --> 01:36:59,311
How could they not see
how extraordinary you are...

1871
01:36:59,350 --> 01:37:00,647
how big your heart is?

1872
01:37:03,621 --> 01:37:05,589
I'm not even that smart,
and I can see it.

1873
01:37:05,623 --> 01:37:07,921
It's so obvious.

1874
01:37:07,959 --> 01:37:09,950
I mean, you're the easiest kid
in the world to love.

1875
01:37:09,994 --> 01:37:11,689
Well, to me, you are.

1876
01:37:13,865 --> 01:37:15,264
You know what I think?

1877
01:37:17,402 --> 01:37:19,427
I think you love me, too.

1878
01:37:20,738 --> 01:37:21,966
Like you're
just filled with it.

1879
01:37:23,107 --> 01:37:25,473
Think it's just waiting
to burst out of you.

1880
01:37:29,080 --> 01:37:31,241
Dennis, you're my son.

1881
01:37:31,282 --> 01:37:34,149
You're my home, forever.

1882
01:37:35,153 --> 01:37:38,486
And I will
never, ever, ever...

1883
01:37:38,523 --> 01:37:41,219
ever, ever...

1884
01:37:41,259 --> 01:37:44,285
ever, ever, ever...

1885
01:37:45,730 --> 01:37:47,095
leave you.

1886
01:37:52,603 --> 01:37:54,002
Okay.

1887
01:37:54,038 --> 01:37:55,232
I got you.

1888
01:37:56,908 --> 01:37:58,432
I got you.

1889
01:37:59,477 --> 01:38:00,842
I got you.

1890
01:38:06,217 --> 01:38:08,708
Hey, Dennis,
I got my Martian wish.

1891
01:38:13,725 --> 01:38:15,784
Oh, my God.

1892
01:38:15,827 --> 01:38:16,987
It's okay.

1893
01:38:19,263 --> 01:38:20,321
"Sometimes we forget...

1894
01:38:20,364 --> 01:38:22,730
"that children have
just arrived on the earth.

1895
01:38:22,767 --> 01:38:25,395
"They are a little like aliens
coming into being...

1896

"as bundles of energy
and pure potential...

1897

"here on some kind
of exploratory mission...

1898

"and they're
just trying to learn...

1899
01:38:31,309 --> 01:38:32,776
"what it means to be human. "

1900
01:38:33,978 --> 01:38:36,003
"For some reason, Dennis and I
reached out into the universe...

"and found each other...

really know how or why...

1903

I can love an alien...

"and he can love a creature...

1905
01:38:45,089 --> 01:38:47,023
"and that's weird enough
for both of us. "

1906
01:38:58,102 --> 01:39:00,935
Two, three. Hold on!

1907
01:39:00,972 --> 01:39:02,997
Come on, one more,
one more, one more.

1908
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:05,065
One, two, three.

1909
01:39:05,710 --> 01:39:06,699
Was that good?

1910
01:39:06,744 --> 01:39:08,109
- Come on.
- Okay, here we go.

1911
01:39:08,146 --> 01:39:09,135
Okay, guys.

1912
01:39:09,180 --> 01:39:12,013
- # Sun is shinin' in the sky #
- That's all right.

# There ain't a cloud in sight #

1914

- Aw!
# It's stopped rainin' #

1915
01:39:16,921 --> 01:39:19,047
# Everybody's in a play #

# And don't you know,
it's a beautiful new day #

# See how the sun shines
brightly in the city #

1920
