1
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:07,323
Burt.

2
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,662
- What?
- Don't.

3
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,327
Why?

4
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:11,927
Come back up here,
I want to kiss you.

5
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:13,973
No, come on. I want to do
this. I'm staying down here.

6
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,371
Okay.

7
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:19,234
- Just don't blow.
- What?

8
00:01:20,046 --> 00:01:21,138
Don't blow.

9
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:22,738
Why would I blow?

10
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:24,807
I don't know why you do
anything you do, Burt.

11
00:01:24,884 --> 00:01:26,511
Just don't blow.

12
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:29,721
- Okay. Just stop moving. Okay?
- Okay.

13
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:30,778
You'll love it.

14
00:01:30,857 --> 00:01:33,018
All right,
no more talking.

15
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,000
What's wrong?

16
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:49,063
Nothing.

17
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:51,267
Why'd you stop?

18
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:55,178
I'm just trying to figure out
how to say what I'm about to say.

19
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:57,944
Why do you have
to say anything?

20
00:01:58,017 --> 00:02:01,783
You taste different.
Did you know that?

21
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:05,420
No, Burt.
How would I know that?

22
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:08,393
Just get up here. Okay? I don't want
to keep talking to the top of your head.

23
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:09,655
- Do you want me to shower?
- No, no.

24
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:12,254
You don't taste dirty.
You just taste different.

25
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:14,630
Like, kind of fruity.

26
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:15,895
God.

27
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:19,530
Wait. Did you know a woman can taste
different depending on various co-factors?

28
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:20,630
I don't want to hear that.

29
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:23,175
And I thought that we agreed you
wouldn't use the word "co-factors".

30
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:24,835
No, I said I wouldn't misuse it.

31
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:28,039
All I'm saying is, from what
I've read about vaginal flavor...

32
00:02:28,114 --> 00:02:30,173
- Jesus!
- From what I've read,

33
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:34,118
abrupt changes can happen when
a woman's either menopausal

34
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:36,382
or...

35
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,139
Burt?

36
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:00,006
Oh! Good, you're awake.

37
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:01,239
What are you doing?

38
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:04,382
Cobbling.

39
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:12,783
I really want to be that dad that knows
how to make stuff out of wood. You know?

40
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:18,158
I just want our kid to wake up in the
morning and walk out on the back porch

41
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:20,927
and find me cobbling.

42
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:23,761
You know, that's
not what it's called.

43
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:25,201
Yeah, it is.

44
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:27,432
Burt, cobbling is shoes.

45
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:31,871
That's why the people that
make shoes are called cobblers.

46
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:35,041
You're not cobbling,
you're carving.

47
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:37,912
Or possibly whittling.

48
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,387
- Good morning.
- Morning.

49
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:44,548
I got this great book on knots.

50
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:46,649
300 knots, and I'm gonna learn them all.

51
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:50,992
And I still have to build that
kiln. Man, you gotta be ready.

52
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,089
You remember, we go to your
parents' house this afternoon?

53
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:57,398
Yeah, you know, I pushed that because
I have Family Defense class today.

54
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,529
Yeah. Does everybody
there dress like that?

55
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:01,233
Hey, where are those
goggles you had?

56
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:02,797
- My airbrush ones?
- Yeah.

57
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,570
- You can't use them.
- Got them.

58
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:05,633
Burt.

59
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:07,373
All right.
I will be back at 3:00.

60
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:10,678
Maybe a little later if I get
into some hand-to-hand combat.

61
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,581
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

62
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:27,496
They look like the
California Raisins, remember?

63
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:31,003
The big bodies, the little
legs and the sunglasses.

64
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,059
<i>Lovely.</i>

65
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:35,073
It's so bad. I really
wish you could see this.

66
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:39,268
You want to hear the
pregnancy rap? It's even worse.

67
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:42,109
<i>You get much more
from your pelvic floor</i>

68
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:44,581
<i>When you pass on the bagel
and do one more Kegel</i>

69
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:50,416
Jesus Christ. Tell me, do I have to
be this uncool for the rest of my life?

70
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,390
<i>What are you doing? You're talking
to me while you're exercising?</i>

71
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:54,949
No, I'm just watching it.

72
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:57,155
I have this subdural
hematoma thing due Friday.

73
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,095
I'm trying to finish it
before we go out tonight.

74
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:01,531
<i>Out? You two? Where?</i>

75
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:03,068
Dinner at Burt's parents'.

76
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,262
<i>Ooh!</i>

77
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:07,406
<i>They must be
out-of-their-minds excited.</i>

78
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:08,565
Yeah, you know them.

79
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:11,201
I think they're probably happy
to be the only set of grandparents

80
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:13,006
and have the baby
to themselves.

81
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:15,775
<i>Don't say that. You're lucky
to have them so close.</i>

82
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:18,908
I know, I know. We're gonna
lean pretty hard on them.

83
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,509
<i>You know I'd be
there if I could.</i>

84
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:22,349
<i>I hate that I'll be so far away.</i>

85
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:23,946
I know.

86
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:25,581
<i>Who do you think
she'll look like?</i>

87
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,523
God, I hope she
doesn't have Burt's...

88
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:28,753
<i>What, facial hair?</i>

89
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:29,920
Feet.

90
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,793
<i>Those feet. Square feet.</i>

91
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:33,525
Like seal flippers.

92
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:38,337
Oh! Shit, I just gave
this guy's brain a vulva.

93
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:43,240
I really want her to have
an epic kind of childhood.

94
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:47,939
I want her to run along streams
and know how to work a canoe,

95
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,982
be able to entertain
herself outside.

96
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:53,576
I want her childhood to
be Huck Finn-y. You know?

97
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:56,522
Yeah. I had that.

98
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,956
Yeah, exactly.

99
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:12,233
Burt Farlander.

100
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:15,172
Oh! Oh! Oh!

101
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:17,539
You old so-and-so.

102
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:21,206
I'm sorry about
your Pacers, my friend.

103
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,649
Hey, if you think Mike Dunleavy can
carry more than a bucket of water,

104
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:29,745
I got some Florida swampland
you might be interested in. Yeah.

105
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:30,811
That's loud.

106
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:31,948
No, real good price.

107
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:40,193
Yeah. Yeah.

108
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:44,234
Oh! That one gets me
every time. Yeah.

109
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:46,897
Well, I'm glad
you called. Yeah.

110
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:12,163
You're too much.
All right, I will. Bye.

111
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:22,799
They expect that from me.

112
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:26,678
They expect you to sound
like Casey Kasem.

113
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,439
Verona, most of these guys
are in their 50s and 60s.

114
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:32,950
We're talking about millions
of dollars in insurance futures.

115
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:37,422
They don't want to be dealing with some
33-year-old that didn't finish college.

116
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,755
So, Casey Kasem finished college?

117
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,151
Yeah.

118
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:49,732
- This next long-distance dedication...
- No.

119
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:53,966
...goes out to a really
special girl. The letter reads,

120
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:59,672
"Dear Casey, my name is Burt, and my
girlfriend's pregnant and frustrated.

121
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:05,274
"Could you play a song that will make her
smile? Thanks. Signed, Burt Farlander. "

122
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:09,446
Your pregnant girlfriend's gonna kill you.

123
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:17,828
Go away.

124
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:18,955
Thanks, Casey.

125
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:44,417
Oh! Look at you!
You look so big!

126
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,390
Good for you! Hi.

127
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:47,926
Wow, look
at your hair.

128
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:49,018
I freed it!

129
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:50,756
I don't think it makes
you look crazy at all.

130
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:54,664
I know, I know. Get inside. Your
father's just finishing up a call.

131
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:57,234
Sit, Verona. Sit next to me
and let me hear the heartbeat.

132
00:08:57,303 --> 00:09:00,431
You can't hear the heartbeat
'cause her placenta is on... Okay.

133
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:01,530
Well, Bill,
if you believe that,

134
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:05,236
I've got a bridge in New York you
might be interested in. Yep, okay.

135
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:07,245
<i>- That is really sweet.
- Au revoir.</i>

136
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,874
Hey, Jerry. You're looking so
much better. You can barely tell.

137
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:15,420
Oh! Thank you, my dear.

138
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:17,547
Verona, you look beautific.

139
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:18,647
Thank you.

140
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,316
Hey, did you bring the
pictures from the sonogram?

141
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,883
I did. Here you go, Dad.

142
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:23,690
These are fabulous.

143
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:25,094
You haven't opened
the envelope yet.

144
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:27,064
I can just tell
he's a beauty.

145
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:28,464
She's a girl. Did you...

146
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:30,229
Yes. I did tell you that, Dad.

147
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:34,672
She's a beauty.
Wow. Spectacular.

148
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:38,975
Exquisite. I mean,
talk about perfection.

149
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:41,138
Verona, do you think
she's gonna look like you?

150
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:43,340
Well, I hope so.
I think I'm the mom.

151
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,043
I just want a little Verona.

152
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:48,644
After two boys, I want a little Verona
in a leotard. Can you do that for me?

153
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:51,656
I will definitely
work on it.

154
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:54,090
Okay, and just how black
do you think she'll be?

155
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,525
Mom...

156
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,029
Wow. I don't know.

157
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:02,056
Maybe we can leave her out in the sun
for a couple of days, expedite things?

158
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:03,465
Verona, are you on schedule?

159
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:05,936
Oh! Jerry!
You don't ask her that!

160
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:08,838
But I'll tell you what scares me,
it's that tilted uterus of yours.

161
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:09,966
Does it really?

162
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:12,442
Do you think that's gonna
make the delivery hell?

163
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:13,500
I don't know.

164
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:14,944
- You know how I had this one?
- Yes.

165
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:16,038
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

166
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,810
- In the tub. Uh-huh.
- Yep.

167
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:20,579
I had to call the fire
department, it happened so fast.

168
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:22,177
The water broke, I make the call.

169
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:25,280
Ten minutes later, three
firemen burst in the bathroom.

170
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:26,985
- You've got to picture me.
- No, we don't.

171
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:32,588
I'm 23, gorgeous, alone, the skirt's
hiked up to the waist, the legs are apart,

172
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:34,530
I'm huffing and puffing, and bang!

173
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,364
I'm surrounded by the
three men in the uniforms.

174
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:40,767
It's August, so humid.

175
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,502
My blouse is soaked,
I'm engorged with milk...

176
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:46,272
Did they bring their hoses, Gloria?

177
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:48,336
They were all over me.

178
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:53,378
Very capable men, knew
exactly what they were doing.

179
00:10:56,355 --> 00:11:02,123
Almighty food gatherer, father
of the earth, sky, water and ice

180
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:06,430
and food,
we give you thanks.

181
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:09,900
Thank you.

182
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:13,800
So, we've been reading
a bunch of books,

183
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:16,467
trying to decide what kind of
birthing experience we want to have.

184
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:18,271
That's terrific.

185
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:22,474
And we think that we want to limit
the amount of people in the room,

186
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:24,243
or near the room.

187
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:27,984
Well, you don't have
to worry about that.

188
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:30,454
Right. No sweat.

189
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:34,593
And we decided that we don't want
any videotaping. Sorry, Jerry.

190
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,890
Right, I won't.
Fabulous.

191
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:40,326
But we really want
to share this with you.

192
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,458
Your presence is really,
really important to us.

193
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,560
- Definitely.
- Yeah, yeah.

194
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,865
You're so right. We so
are looking forward to it.

195
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:48,998
We will definitely be there.

196
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:52,533
The only reason we won't be there
is if we're living in Belgium.

197
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:54,839
Okay, we have news.

198
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:55,938
It's big.

199
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:57,744
- What is it?
- We're leaving in June.

200
00:11:57,817 --> 00:11:59,216
We're finally doing it.

201
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:00,547
You're leaving in June?

202
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:01,643
Mmm-hmm.

203
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,086
The baby's due in July.

204
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:06,056
Right. To Antwerp.
City of light.

205
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,685
Well, that's not...
No, you're not.

206
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:10,422
Yeah, we are.
It's gonna be superb.

207
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:12,623
No. And don't say that word.

208
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:13,687
We thought you'd be proud of us.

209
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:15,529
We've been talking about this for 15 years.

210
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:17,501
And now we can finally do it.

211
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:21,529
You're leaving a month
before the baby's born?

212
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:27,175
You're moving 3,000 miles
away from your grandchild.

213
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,111
I think it's more than
3,000, isn't it, Jerry?

214
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:31,945
I think so.

215
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:33,814
I can't believe this!

216
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:35,114
There are planes, Burt.

217
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:38,213
We've been planning this
forever, folks. You know that.

218
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,451
I didn't know that.

219
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:43,620
Wait, hold on a second. How
long are you gonna live there?

220
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:44,754
Just two years. Okay?

221
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:47,822
"Just two years"? You guys.

222
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,425
Wait. Are you selling the house?

223
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:53,472
See, that's the best part. We
were going to rent the house out

224
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:56,474
with the help of a very
elegant gentleman named Fareed,

225
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:58,009
but no one's come forward yet. So...

226
00:12:58,077 --> 00:13:00,068
Wait. How long have
you been planning this?

227
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:02,671
Hold on. If we don't find
a renter in the next month,

228
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:04,443
you two can stay here
while we're gone.

229
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:06,747
You can have the house
for the next two years.

230
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:07,979
Outstanding.

231
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:18,962
Were your ears burning?

232
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:21,591
Your ears must have been on fire, sir.

233
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:23,032
What is that?

234
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:24,126
Oh!

235
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:28,435
Magnificent, isn't it? I didn't
think you'd notice. $12,000.

236
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:31,108
I cannot believe it.

237
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:33,543
I know. She's a Choctaw princess, I'm told.

238
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:37,810
I think it's important
that we honor our Indian...

239
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:40,909
Indigent people...
Our ingenious...

240
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:44,112
In-de-gentious people.

241
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,555
Who was it?

242
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:49,616
Nobody.

243
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:55,528
Was it... Was it Fareed?

244
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:56,727
Later.

245
00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:58,531
Later. Hmm.

246
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,640
If it was Fareed, did he...

247
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:02,935
Yeah.

248
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,908
- He did? He...
- Mmm-hmm.

249
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:13,146
When? The day we
leave. The day we leave.

250
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:14,880
Oh, my God!

251
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:18,615
I guess we've got some
more news for you two.

252
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:22,719
We could get someone else
to be the grandparents.

253
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:25,457
Those old people, across the
street, what are their names?

254
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,260
I mean, we moved
here for them.

255
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:30,825
And now, they're gonna miss
the baby's first two years.

256
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:34,995
It just really takes
selfishness to a whole new level.

257
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:40,837
It's not like your parents
are doing anything.

258
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,705
My parents are dead, Burt.

259
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:45,750
Still.

260
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:54,489
I can see my breath.

261
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,120
Hold on, I'll get the thing.

262
00:14:57,196 --> 00:15:00,927
Make it nice and toasty.
There you go.

263
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:04,263
- God damn it.
- Great.

264
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:06,167
All I did was turn it on.

265
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:09,696
I even said to the guy at the store,
I said, "Could I have a red fuse?"

266
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:10,969
He said,
"You want a blue fuse".

267
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:12,340
I said, "No, I already
had the blue fuse.

268
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:15,847
"Didn't work out great.
So I'll take a red one. "

269
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:19,043
He's like, "Trust me,
it's the blue one. "Okay".

270
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:22,554
Now we know who will be
getting a red fuse next time.

271
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:28,353
Burt. You know, we
don't have to stay here.

272
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,123
What?

273
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,764
I'm saying we could leave, too.

274
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:35,231
But we live here.

275
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:39,237
I know, but the only reason that we're
here is because your parents are here.

276
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:41,239
Or were here.

277
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:44,469
Well, where would we go?

278
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:46,807
I don't know. We could
go anywhere we want.

279
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:47,937
Anywhere anywhere?

280
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:49,002
Yeah.

281
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:50,810
I can do my job from anywhere.

282
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:52,851
And all you need's a phone, right?

283
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:55,352
Well, we don't want to go
back to Chicago, do we?

284
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:57,321
No, we did Chicago.

285
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:02,349
I used to picture myself in
Alaska. God, I love that landscape.

286
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:03,952
- Alaska?
- Yeah.

287
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:06,463
You've never mentioned Alaska.

288
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:10,767
Wow, they pay people
to live in Alaska.

289
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:12,060
Oh!

290
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:16,836
Phoenix. We could
live near my sister.

291
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:19,901
She could be Auntie Grace all the time.

292
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,312
Think of that, Burt.
That would make me so happy.

293
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:25,746
And Lily and Lowell
live there.

294
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:26,842
Who are Lily and Lowell?

295
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,853
Lily, my old
boss in Chicago.

296
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:29,910
Right.

297
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,551
What do you
think of that?

298
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:37,694
Yeah, they could be
our friends in Phoenix.

299
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:39,526
They weren't really
our friends in Chicago.

300
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:43,261
I know, but they could be
when we live in Phoenix.

301
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:48,606
They could be our new good
friends when we live in Phoenix.

302
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:54,375
Well, we wouldn't need a
space heater in Phoenix.

303
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:00,444
Burt, are we fuck-ups?

304
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,508
No.

305
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,687
What do you mean?

306
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:07,726
I mean, we're 34.

307
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:08,817
33.

308
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:11,795
We don't even have this
basic stuff figured out.

309
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,059
Basic, like how?

310
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:15,998
Basic, like how to live.

311
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,835
We're not fuck-ups.

312
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,772
We have a cardboard window.

313
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:29,006
We're not fuck-ups.

314
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:33,444
I think
we might be fuck-ups.

315
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:35,043
We're not fuck-ups.

316
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,532
Are we nuts?

317
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:53,832
Well, look around.

318
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,568
We both agree we need to
be near some kind of family.

319
00:17:56,642 --> 00:18:02,547
Some friends, something. Some
connection, someone we know, so...

320
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:05,139
We'll look at Phoenix,
see my sister.

321
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:06,445
Your closest friends.

322
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:07,712
Lily and Lowell.

323
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:09,720
And then to Madison
for your job interview.

324
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:11,016
My what?

325
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,785
God. Your interview.

326
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,920
Your interview
with Mutual Choice.

327
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:20,431
To see if they'll give you a
better commission? You set it up.

328
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:23,093
Okay. So then from
Madison, we go home.

329
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:25,568
No. Did you look
at the itinerary?

330
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:28,003
I stapled it to the
inside of your jacket.

331
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:31,339
See? From Madison,
we go to Montreal.

332
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,935
Montreal is where I think we should
live if we don't live in Phoenix.

333
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:36,810
Okay, Montreal.

334
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:42,116
See? This is exciting,
if you think about it.

335
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:44,883
We're completely
untethered, Burt.

336
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,118
This is a dream scenario.

337
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,063
What are you doing?

338
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:27,758
Honey,
let me tuck you in.

339
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:34,795
God, look at you!
You're only six months in!

340
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:39,867
Jesus, you're huge!
And your face, it's so fat!

341
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:42,345
Come here, give us a hug!

342
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:47,745
Lowell, come and give a hug to the
most beautiful woman in the world.

343
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:49,878
- Look at that.
- Nice to see you, Lowell.

344
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:51,388
Come on,
don't be such a pill.

345
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:53,219
He's upset 'cause
we didn't get into the club.

346
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:54,657
Hey, how are you?

347
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:57,217
Good, I was almost out.
I'll get an opener.

348
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:59,856
Verona and I were
desk buddies in Chicago.

349
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:05,029
- I hired her at the agency. - That
was before she broke out on her own.

350
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:09,233
I still have no idea where you learned
how to paint the insides of dead people.

351
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:13,870
So fucking disgusting, girlfriend!
Come on, let's get a drink.

352
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:16,039
She's so talented,
our little artiste.

353
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:19,116
<i>For the land</i>

354
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:22,944
<i>Of the free</i>

355
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:30,128
<i>And the home of the brave</i>

356
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,697
Play ball.

357
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:42,071
Wow. So, you're in Arizona now.

358
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,505
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

359
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,338
- To the Arizonans.
- You got it.

360
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:48,743
God. I can't believe it. I can't
believe how big the kids are now.

361
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:50,304
- Right?
- And Taylor's so handsome.

362
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:53,317
Well, thanks. We're gonna
do something about those ears.

363
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:56,684
Do you see them? He looks like
a trophy. You know what I mean?

364
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,882
One of those trophies
with the arms on it.

365
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:00,549
Oh, my God.

366
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:07,097
And this one has that dyke look.

367
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:09,099
She walks like a teamster, doesn't she?

368
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:12,227
I mean, it's weird. She's only
12, and I know she's a dyke.

369
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:15,000
Ashley! Ashley!

370
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:19,774
Show Verona your tough-girl
walk. Come on. Go butch on us.

371
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,270
Come on! Come on!

372
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:25,510
Oh! Now she's shy.
Did you see her ass?

373
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:28,519
She's got like...
What is it? What is it?

374
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:29,952
What?
Junk in the trunk.

375
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:33,287
She's got junk in her trunk!

376
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:35,849
Oh, my God!

377
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,726
It looks like a duffel
bag full of bricks.

378
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,527
I don't know if dykes
go for that or not.

379
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,125
Do they? Burt, you worked
with a lesbian, didn't you?

380
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:45,601
Oh!

381
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:46,899
Yes. Yes, I did.

382
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,837
I can't hear you!

383
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:53,370
I just don't think we should be talking
about it right in front of the children.

384
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:57,142
Please. Burt, it's just white
noise to them. Listen, watch this.

385
00:21:57,215 --> 00:21:59,479
Taylor? Taylor?

386
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:04,648
Taylor? Taylor? Taylor? Taylor? Taylor?

387
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:09,185
I can keep going on and on.
They don't hear us. Seriously.

388
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:10,421
So tell me
about the dyke.

389
00:22:10,562 --> 00:22:13,861
<i>The greyhounds have reached the starting
box for this afternoon's first race.</i>

390
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:17,459
<i>They are ready to go
over the 550-yard course.</i>

391
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:19,333
What's your line again, Burt?

392
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:21,167
Insurance.

393
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:22,706
Like life insurance?

394
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:23,798
Sometimes.

395
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:29,245
But it's mostly insurance futures.
It's pretty cool, actually.

396
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:33,310
Similar to how an individual
or a family might get insurance,

397
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:36,183
insurance companies
need insurance themselves.

398
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:37,687
It's sort of this
hedge against...

399
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:39,747
Goddamn.

400
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:41,224
Of course
it would come to this.

401
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:42,954
Yeah. What?

402
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:47,092
They made us afraid
of everything.

403
00:22:47,165 --> 00:22:50,657
Insurance for insurance,
for insurance.

404
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,498
This country
is just such a...

405
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:58,440
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
it is now race time.</i>

406
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,807
Well, anyway,
if this country is shit,

407
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,846
everyone else is just
the flies on our shit.

408
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:02,971
Am I right?

409
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,811
<i>And away
they go and to the inside.</i>

410
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:07,215
<i>157 powers out to the front,
followed by the...</i>

411
00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:09,617
Go! Go!

412
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:10,985
<i>...now on the inside turn...</i>

413
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,284
Pick it up, pal!
Pick it up!

414
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:13,790
Hey, Lowell!

415
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:17,061
I used to have nice tits, right?

416
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:21,157
Verona doesn't seem to
remember, I don't think.

417
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,793
I had nice jugs, right?

418
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:27,737
They sucked me dry.
I don't even need a bra.

419
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:31,367
Now I just tuck them into my
socks. You ready for that, Burt?

420
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:34,469
They'll look like
an old man's nut sack.

421
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:41,243
They even grow hair on them.
A hairy old man's nut sack.

422
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:45,114
<i>In Some Time and Queen Anne...</i>

423
00:23:45,223 --> 00:23:47,657
<i>In Some Time!
Queen Anne is second.</i>

424
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:49,522
Look at them go!

425
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:51,462
Pathetic.

426
00:23:52,964 --> 00:23:55,057
So, Burt,
you excited about all this?

427
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:56,157
Yeah.

428
00:23:56,234 --> 00:23:58,134
This might be the best
one I've ever seen.

429
00:23:58,203 --> 00:24:02,833
No, the baby, dummy. Does this mean
you guys will finally get married?

430
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:04,603
- They're not married?
- I told you that.

431
00:24:04,676 --> 00:24:07,702
Burt wants to, Verona
doesn't see the point.

432
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:12,739
Insurance, for one. If anyone,
you should understand that, Bart.

433
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:15,753
Anyone ever call you Bart?
It'd be kind of funny.

434
00:24:15,821 --> 00:24:17,789
We didn't have insurance
when Ashley was born.

435
00:24:17,856 --> 00:24:21,314
Well, we thought we did, and then we
didn't. And then I couldn't get it.

436
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:25,386
Pre-existing condition.
I'm crazy!

437
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:28,760
Look, whatever.

438
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:30,301
I don't know. I...

439
00:24:30,368 --> 00:24:33,360
I guess I just never gave that
much thought to "marriage" marriage.

440
00:24:33,438 --> 00:24:36,430
Well, at the very least, it'll keep you
from taking off in the middle of the night

441
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:37,532
when there's trouble.

442
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:42,342
I almost left Lowell about a
dozen times. Kids don't know that.

443
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:46,783
And then you start thinking about
the wedding and all that money...

444
00:24:46,852 --> 00:24:49,116
$46,000 for ours.

445
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:55,185
It was worth maybe
$31,000, $31,500.

446
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:59,296
I hope you guys move here.

447
00:24:59,364 --> 00:25:02,094
We're having a hell of a time
breaking into the social world here.

448
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,156
Really?

449
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:04,702
It seems very cliquish.

450
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:07,533
I don't know what it is. We
didn't get into the good golf club.

451
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:10,006
There's no water
left, anyway.

452
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:15,303
The drought's coming. Like the
biblical flood, but in reverse.

453
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:20,316
The golf course will be the
first to go. Then the fountains.

454
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:25,489
All the water fountains.
The restaurants.

455
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:29,284
Basic services.

456
00:25:30,629 --> 00:25:34,998
Large mammals.
Then regular-size mammals.

457
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:39,770
Reptiles. Birds.

458
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:44,004
Then people.

459
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:51,072
You done?

460
00:25:54,686 --> 00:25:57,052
Thanks for treating.

461
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:04,186
This was wonderful.
I so hope you move down here.

462
00:26:04,262 --> 00:26:07,356
This is the place for
you guys. It's so obvious.

463
00:26:07,432 --> 00:26:09,491
Don't listen to anyone else.

464
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:12,901
And I'm sorry I said anything
about the marriage stuff.

465
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:13,960
No!

466
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:15,097
No, you guys do
what you need to do.

467
00:26:15,173 --> 00:26:18,336
Your baby won't care.
Kids are resilient.

468
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,776
And they're genetically
predetermined anyway.

469
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:23,473
They're screwed up
out of the womb. So what?

470
00:26:23,548 --> 00:26:27,450
They'll have cell phones,
they'll be fine. Okay.

471
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,281
It was so great
to see you.

472
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:32,186
- Bye, honey.
- Bye.

473
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:34,750
- Bye.
- Okay.

474
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:50,908
Lowell!

475
00:27:01,987 --> 00:27:03,181
You don't agree with them, do you?

476
00:27:03,254 --> 00:27:04,812
No.

477
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:07,652
About what?

478
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:12,595
That thing they said earlier, about
how you can't make a good family.

479
00:27:12,664 --> 00:27:14,529
Everything's
destined for failure.

480
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:15,998
No, I don't.

481
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:20,100
You know that I don't
agree, Burt. I just...

482
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:22,605
I really hate that attitude, you
know? "Everything's already broken,

483
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:26,337
"so why don't we just keep on
breaking it again and again?"

484
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:34,250
Hey, did you... Did you hear
what Lily said about her boobs?

485
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,411
Mmm.

486
00:27:37,255 --> 00:27:39,120
Did you know Lily
when she had her boobs?

487
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:41,158
Man, she was huge.

488
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:45,324
Really?

489
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:46,694
Enormous.

490
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:58,704
But as long as the
baby's healthy, right?

491
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:13,885
You awake?

492
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:15,220
Mmm-hmm.

493
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:29,903
You're my light, Verona.
My sky.

494
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:36,877
I can't wait
to see you as a mom.

495
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,582
Her little hand in yours.

496
00:28:43,354 --> 00:28:46,084
And your smile on her face.

497
00:28:53,331 --> 00:28:54,958
What?

498
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,596
What are we gonna do?

499
00:28:58,670 --> 00:28:59,932
What?

500
00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:03,466
What are we
gonna do?

501
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:06,072
How do you mean?

502
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:12,773
No one's in love
like us, right?

503
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:19,183
It's so weird.
What are we gonna do?

504
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:32,135
I think we just
gotta ride it out.

505
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:22,385
Hey, listen, I need you to
concentrate for a second, okay?

506
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:23,681
Okay. My sister's been dating

507
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:26,724
this guy named Rob, who seems
nice, but she thinks he's boring.

508
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:29,021
He likes going to steakhouses,
that kind of thing.

509
00:30:29,093 --> 00:30:30,492
- Good afternoon, madam.
- Hi.

510
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:32,996
Wait, is that a good thing
or a bad thing, steakhouses?

511
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:34,292
Bad. Anyway...

512
00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:35,559
Like an Outback
Steakhouse?

513
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:36,759
I'm not sure.

514
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:37,995
Ruth's Chris Steakhouse?

515
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:39,263
I honestly don't know.

516
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:40,895
But we need to make
him seem cool.

517
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:43,304
She loves you, Burt. She'll value
your endorsement of this guy.

518
00:30:43,374 --> 00:30:44,739
I got it.

519
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:45,969
And don't look
at her boobs.

520
00:30:46,044 --> 00:30:48,638
No, I'm over it.
I was better last time.

521
00:30:48,713 --> 00:30:50,613
Yeah, but she's bigger now.
She went on the pill

522
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:54,516
and she's been complaining about
getting new bras and everything.

523
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:56,577
Wait a minute. Why
don't you go on the pill?

524
00:30:56,654 --> 00:30:58,645
Huh!
Let me think.

525
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:03,619
Beckett, what is that?

526
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:04,787
That's a fern.

527
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:07,798
That's right,
this is a fern.

528
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,356
- What's that?
- That's a cactus.

529
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:11,561
That's a cactus,
that's right.

530
00:31:11,636 --> 00:31:13,729
And what is the plural
of cactus, huh?

531
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:14,829
Cacti.

532
00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:18,865
That's right! What
is that? What is that?

533
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:21,200
Baby.

534
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:22,337
That's right,
that's a baby.

535
00:31:22,413 --> 00:31:25,871
This lady is about to have
a baby, huh? Any day now.

536
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,747
- Or in three months.
- Thank you.

537
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:32,188
Beckett. Hey, tell the nice
lady what you know about babies.

538
00:31:34,292 --> 00:31:36,658
No. Go on, tell the nice people what...

539
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:39,424
Beckett,
you're being rude.

540
00:31:39,497 --> 00:31:42,125
Babies like to breathe,
and they're good at hiding it.

541
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,327
I put a pillow over a baby.

542
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:46,927
I thought she wasn't
breathing, but she was.

543
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:49,303
She was sneaky,
but I'll try again.

544
00:31:52,143 --> 00:31:53,542
Okay.

545
00:32:00,885 --> 00:32:03,046
Holy shit,
you're actually showing!

546
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:04,110
I know!

547
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:09,221
I love that dress! Look what
you did to my sister, Burt.

548
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:17,158
So, you want to get a drink here
or go out? Do you need to eat?

549
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:18,224
We don't want
to go out there.

550
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:19,930
Not right now.
No, it's like an oven.

551
00:32:20,004 --> 00:32:21,301
Yeah, it's pretty hot.

552
00:32:21,372 --> 00:32:23,670
No, no, I mean,
literally, like an oven.

553
00:32:23,741 --> 00:32:25,675
Like if you were in an oven,
that's what it would be like.

554
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:27,677
It's almost like
God's trying to melt us

555
00:32:27,745 --> 00:32:29,645
all down and make
something better.

556
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:31,875
Wow, Burt.
That is so stoney.

557
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,043
Well, it's just the Bible.

558
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:35,943
QED.

559
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,915
Two days ago, he asked
me if I liked music.

560
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:39,923
Like music is something
people don't like?

561
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:43,119
You know, he posed the question like
it was some great conversation-starter.

562
00:32:43,194 --> 00:32:45,560
"Grace, do you like music?"
It was painful.

563
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:48,895
I don't know, I wish somebody would
ask me that sometime, you know?

564
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,901
'Cause that's a probing sort
of intelligence, I think.

565
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,368
- Really?
- Yeah.

566
00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:54,701
I mean, he doesn't assume the
obvious. He's a lawyer, right?

567
00:32:54,772 --> 00:32:56,239
- A tax attorney.
- Tax attorney, that's what I mean.

568
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:58,172
So he's gotta be smart,
he's gotta be wily.

569
00:32:58,242 --> 00:32:59,607
He drives a cabriolet.

570
00:32:59,677 --> 00:33:04,546
A cabriolet, that's good
design. Good mileage.

571
00:33:04,615 --> 00:33:06,776
He uses the word "robust".

572
00:33:06,851 --> 00:33:09,649
That's because a lot
of things are robust.

573
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:12,315
He took me
to Long John Silver's.

574
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:14,119
I thought you said
it was a steakhouse.

575
00:33:14,192 --> 00:33:15,887
When I told him I didn't
want to go to the steakhouse,

576
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,121
he took me
to Long John Silver's.

577
00:33:18,196 --> 00:33:21,597
That's being attentive to
your needs and your desires.

578
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,634
Who is this guy?

579
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:29,967
Grace, this guy sounds
like a goddamn champ.

580
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:32,838
He sounds awesome.

581
00:33:33,978 --> 00:33:38,540
I need you to know something. I really
think you guys should get married.

582
00:33:41,786 --> 00:33:43,515
Gotta take this.

583
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:49,517
Ned! Yeah.

584
00:33:50,628 --> 00:33:52,789
Surprised you aren't
hiding under a rock,

585
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,855
the way your Padres
played last night.

586
00:33:54,932 --> 00:33:56,194
Sorry.

587
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,636
Yeah. Well, what was it?

588
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:03,506
Yeah. Yeah.

589
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,170
I thought so.

590
00:34:07,311 --> 00:34:09,609
Look at him.

591
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:13,116
I'm about to have a baby that might
have three hands or a shovel for a head,

592
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:14,446
and the thing he is
most concerned about

593
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:18,285
is whether or not
I'm gonna keep my boobs.

594
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:19,482
I think that's sexy.

595
00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:24,487
Yeah. Yeah.

596
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:28,399
You got lucky, sister.

597
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,329
Yeah, I know.

598
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:40,235
Yeah. No, I did.

599
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,741
What is it?
I'd put a wager on it.

600
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:16,877
So what are you looking for? A
Jacuzzi-type thing? Or a "tub" tub?

601
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,381
Jacuzzi.

602
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:23,117
So how do you feel?
Do you feel different?

603
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:26,648
No. No, I feel the same.

604
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:30,192
Maybe I should
feel different.

605
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:32,286
Maybe it's just
late coming to me.

606
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:33,853
Like everything else.

607
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:35,694
Join the club.

608
00:35:35,766 --> 00:35:38,599
Can you believe Mom was
just 25 when she had you?

609
00:35:38,669 --> 00:35:39,761
Hmm.

610
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:48,778
Get in.

611
00:35:48,846 --> 00:35:51,007
I don't need to get in.
It's a nice tub.

612
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:53,812
Come on.
I'll wash your hair.

613
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,450
If I can get in.

614
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:03,454
It's nice. I like it.

615
00:36:11,702 --> 00:36:14,535
So when was the last time
you went back home?

616
00:36:14,605 --> 00:36:17,039
You know
it's been a long time.

617
00:36:17,775 --> 00:36:19,834
When are you gonna
sell that place, anyway?

618
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:25,076
You mean, when are we gonna
sell it? I don't know. Not yet.

619
00:36:26,717 --> 00:36:28,878
We've had good luck
with renters.

620
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:31,387
Selling it just seems
like the last thing.

621
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:37,521
Can you imagine how excited Mom and
Dad would be if they could see you now?

622
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:39,222
Stop.
You're doing it again.

623
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:40,286
What?

624
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:42,127
You're just getting all...

625
00:36:43,734 --> 00:36:45,702
Trying to get me
to talk about them.

626
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:47,897
It's only because
you never do.

627
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:51,100
I do. You know I do.
I just did.

628
00:36:51,175 --> 00:36:55,874
I just want to talk more. You're
the big sister. You remember more.

629
00:36:57,081 --> 00:36:59,481
Fine. What do you
want to know?

630
00:37:00,484 --> 00:37:03,920
You know that baby's gonna
have something of them in her.

631
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:07,981
I mean, what if she's got Mom's
crazy green eyes or something?

632
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:10,886
What if it's one of those
features that skipped you and me

633
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:13,988
and jumps onto the face
of that little baby?

634
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,492
You're bringing them back,
you know. In a little way.

635
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:23,936
I know.

636
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:31,872
Are you trying to make
me cry in a bathtub?

637
00:37:31,949 --> 00:37:34,076
In a bathtub showroom?

638
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:37,554
You're gonna be
a great mom.

639
00:37:38,456 --> 00:37:39,980
Like our mom.

640
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,061
- Hi.
- Hello.

641
00:37:55,139 --> 00:37:58,836
You know you can't fly after
eight months. Airline policy.

642
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:01,343
Oh! I'm only
six months.

643
00:38:01,412 --> 00:38:04,006
Dana, come here
for a second.

644
00:38:06,484 --> 00:38:07,917
Do you have a note
from the doctor?

645
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:10,385
What? Really?

646
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:12,547
It's okay. You're supposed
to have a note from the doctor

647
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:14,250
if you want to fly
after eight months.

648
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:17,783
But I'm only
six months, so...

649
00:38:18,229 --> 00:38:19,253
Uh-huh.

650
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:21,560
Carrie?
You got a minute?

651
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:27,069
She says she's
only six months.

652
00:38:28,272 --> 00:38:30,433
Can you
turn to the side?

653
00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:34,543
I think this
is better, actually.

654
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:40,146
This is the railroad.
The romance of the rails.

655
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:44,113
'Rona, it's like Casey Jones
or Thomas the Train.

656
00:38:44,188 --> 00:38:47,021
Hey, you know what?
We might see some buffalo.

657
00:38:53,297 --> 00:38:55,663
I'm so tired of being big.

658
00:38:58,035 --> 00:39:00,663
I'm tired of not
having sex.

659
00:39:00,738 --> 00:39:02,399
Do you
want to have sex?

660
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:03,633
No.

661
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:07,568
We haven't done
it in a month.

662
00:39:07,645 --> 00:39:09,613
And you don't want to now?

663
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,669
No.

664
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:19,851
I just... I feel so ugly.

665
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:27,762
No, no, no. Don't be sad.

666
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:33,068
You're not that big.
You're still super-sexy.

667
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:34,627
Hot, even.

668
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:40,104
Oh! No. Honey... Hey.

669
00:39:45,082 --> 00:39:47,243
I'll always love you.

670
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,786
Even if you're enormous.

671
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:55,982
Even if it takes you months
to lose this weight. A year.

672
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:59,891
Even if you gain weight
after having the baby.

673
00:40:00,631 --> 00:40:06,126
Even if you gain so much weight
that I can't find your vagina.

674
00:40:09,473 --> 00:40:13,239
You go ahead and write
that in stone in your heart.

675
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:18,004
I will love you.

676
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:24,213
Even if I can't find your vagina.

677
00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:30,854
Her heart rate's pretty slow.

678
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:31,917
What is it?

679
00:40:31,996 --> 00:40:33,258
It's like 115.

680
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:34,524
That seems normal
enough, right?

681
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:37,499
Well, it's supposed to be
between 120 and 160.

682
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:40,128
She's just mellow.
Mellow's good.

683
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:43,537
I don't want mellow now. I
want lively now, mellow later.

684
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:44,767
I think it's fine.

685
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:46,469
That's 'cause you
don't want to fight.

686
00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:49,377
We should fight more,
just get riled up.

687
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:50,641
Didn't we fight last night?

688
00:40:50,714 --> 00:40:52,272
No, we discussed.

689
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:55,443
We need to fight. You
never raise your voice.

690
00:40:56,153 --> 00:40:57,381
Okay.

691
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:03,188
You've done something wrong,
and I'm really bothered by it.

692
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:05,251
Man, am I cross.
Real mad.

693
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:08,321
No, it has to be convincing.

694
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:09,388
Like, should I swear?

695
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,230
No, just raise your voice.

696
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:13,202
You cuntsucker!

697
00:41:15,072 --> 00:41:16,562
I didn't mean now.

698
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,370
But the element of
surprise is so crucial.

699
00:41:19,443 --> 00:41:21,604
You've never heard me say
"cuntsucker" before, have you?

700
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:23,476
- No.
- See?

701
00:41:24,882 --> 00:41:28,545
And I will get that heart
rate up. I know what I'm doing.

702
00:41:33,691 --> 00:41:36,353
Wow, look at this.
This is really nice.

703
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:37,792
Yeah, it is.

704
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:43,493
So, is Ellen a full
professor or an associate?

705
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:46,331
And wait, which side is she
on? She's a first cousin, right?

706
00:41:46,403 --> 00:41:49,372
She's not technically
my cousin, actually.

707
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,206
Her mom was an old friend of
my dad's. I've no idea how.

708
00:41:54,044 --> 00:41:56,638
Anyway, they started calling
us cousins when we were kids.

709
00:41:56,714 --> 00:41:59,945
She always used to make
me take pictures of her.

710
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:01,041
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

711
00:42:01,118 --> 00:42:03,484
Do you know where Ellen
Fisher-Herrin's office is?

712
00:42:03,554 --> 00:42:06,853
Ellen Fisher-Herrin.
Yes, I do know.

713
00:42:06,924 --> 00:42:08,721
As a matter of fact,
she's in William Stone Hall.

714
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:10,817
Room 340,
about halfway down.

715
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:12,829
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

716
00:42:12,897 --> 00:42:15,627
She'll be the mom
without the stroller.

717
00:42:17,935 --> 00:42:19,334
She doesn't have
a stroller?

718
00:42:19,403 --> 00:42:21,633
I thought you said she got
some sort of big trust fund.

719
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:24,674
She did. Oh! Here it is.

720
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:29,504
I thought her name was Ellen.
What does "L-N" stand for?

721
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,013
No!

722
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:34,343
Don't say anything. Please.

723
00:42:36,253 --> 00:42:37,550
It's open.

724
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:40,013
Here we go.

725
00:42:42,593 --> 00:42:44,060
Hello.

726
00:42:44,662 --> 00:42:46,323
Welcome.

727
00:42:47,131 --> 00:42:49,156
Come on in.
Come on in.

728
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,232
Come on in. Okay.

729
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:55,269
Okay.

730
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:59,800
Mama's gonna put
her booby back in.

731
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:02,807
All right.

732
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:07,173
I'll give it right back.
I'll give it right back.

733
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:12,384
So great to have you.
It's good to see you. Hi.

734
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:14,580
How are you?

735
00:43:14,658 --> 00:43:16,057
I'm good. I'm good.

736
00:43:16,126 --> 00:43:17,320
You remember Verona?

737
00:43:17,394 --> 00:43:18,418
Hi.

738
00:43:18,495 --> 00:43:19,860
Of course.

739
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:24,330
How can I forget
such a gorgeous woman?

740
00:43:24,401 --> 00:43:26,801
Oh! Verona,
you just look beautiful.

741
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:27,859
Thanks.

742
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:30,773
Look at your hair.

743
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:34,368
Yeah.

744
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:37,937
And, well, it's a boy.

745
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:39,544
A girl.

746
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:40,606
No.

747
00:43:41,318 --> 00:43:46,517
Really? With those hips and that
shape? Who told you it was a girl?

748
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:51,788
Well, the doctor
and the sonogram...

749
00:43:51,862 --> 00:43:52,886
Well, we'll see.

750
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:53,952
Right.

751
00:43:54,665 --> 00:43:55,757
Should we go?

752
00:43:55,833 --> 00:43:57,130
- Yes.
- Yes.

753
00:43:57,201 --> 00:43:58,793
Sorry we're late.
I tried to call.

754
00:43:58,869 --> 00:44:02,771
Oh! Right. Yeah, I don't answer
the phone when I'm nursing.

755
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,171
It's not fair
to the children.

756
00:44:04,241 --> 00:44:06,835
I gotta get this
one to crafting.

757
00:44:08,879 --> 00:44:11,609
We got directions from this really
nice lady who seemed to know you.

758
00:44:11,682 --> 00:44:14,674
She was... Had brown hair,
wearing a blazer and glasses.

759
00:44:14,752 --> 00:44:15,741
She had a baby.

760
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:17,252
Ruby. Oh!

761
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:20,518
Poor Ruby. She hates me.

762
00:44:20,591 --> 00:44:22,058
I breastfed her baby.

763
00:44:22,126 --> 00:44:23,593
- Pardon?
- Can you do that?

764
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:27,062
Well, I was baby-sitting and
the child was fussing. Starving.

765
00:44:27,131 --> 00:44:31,500
Wouldn't take the bottle. So I fed
him, and he took to me right away.

766
00:44:31,568 --> 00:44:35,595
But, you know, I think my mistake
was... I shouldn't have told her.

767
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:39,404
She's got lactation problems,
and she couldn't appreciate it.

768
00:44:39,476 --> 00:44:42,741
And now she won't let me baby-sit,
she won't let me near her husband,

769
00:44:42,813 --> 00:44:47,750
and I think there's something
strangely paranoid about that, right?

770
00:44:49,753 --> 00:44:53,484
So, dinner. Should we go
out, or do you want to eat in?

771
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:56,184
Let's eat in. We've
had train food all day.

772
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:57,750
Train food.

773
00:44:58,595 --> 00:45:00,529
Okay, let me think.
What do I have?

774
00:45:00,597 --> 00:45:02,758
Let us get the food.
We have a car.

775
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:05,063
We can get the groceries. I mean,
it's the least that we can do.

776
00:45:05,135 --> 00:45:08,696
Look at you, so helpful.

777
00:45:08,772 --> 00:45:12,139
Oh, Burtie. I'm really
proud of you, babe.

778
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:17,275
And I have to say I'm so glad
you guys got pregnant so easily.

779
00:45:17,347 --> 00:45:20,441
I was concerned when I heard
about your tilted uterus.

780
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:28,656
You told her
I have a tilted uterus?

781
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:30,626
I don't know.
Maybe it was my mom.

782
00:45:30,694 --> 00:45:32,218
Is your tilted
uterus a secret?

783
00:45:32,296 --> 00:45:34,924
Yeah, my tilted uterus
is a fucking secret.

784
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,730
Oh, really,
you fucking bitch!

785
00:45:38,802 --> 00:45:41,532
Your fucking uterus
is a motherfucking secret?

786
00:45:41,605 --> 00:45:42,731
Well, fuck you!

787
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:52,841
You know, it was really nice of you
to think of getting them a stroller.

788
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:55,749
Yeah. I had no idea how
expensive it would be.

789
00:45:55,819 --> 00:45:56,808
I told you.

790
00:45:56,887 --> 00:45:58,514
No, like,
really expensive.

791
00:45:58,589 --> 00:45:59,578
I know.

792
00:45:59,656 --> 00:46:01,920
Well, let me just
hide this. There we go.

793
00:46:01,992 --> 00:46:03,425
- You ready?
- Yeah.

794
00:46:05,829 --> 00:46:08,354
You think we got
them a good one?

795
00:46:09,032 --> 00:46:10,329
- Hi.
- Hi.

796
00:46:11,812 --> 00:46:14,480
- Namaste.
- Namaste.

797
00:46:14,505 --> 00:46:15,836
You, too.

798
00:46:17,374 --> 00:46:20,207
Oh, fabulous. Great.

799
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:22,643
If you don't mind, there
are slippers just there.

800
00:46:23,147 --> 00:46:24,341
Just any of these?

801
00:46:24,414 --> 00:46:25,813
Uh-huh.

802
00:46:42,499 --> 00:46:43,932
I like those.

803
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:47,228
Go get the stroller.

804
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:48,293
Okay.

805
00:46:56,013 --> 00:46:58,504
We brought you something.

806
00:46:59,683 --> 00:47:01,776
Oh, my God. How...

807
00:47:06,223 --> 00:47:07,349
Oh, my God.

808
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:13,361
Okay,
all right, I'm sorry.

809
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,395
Why don't we just
put it on the porch?

810
00:47:21,405 --> 00:47:22,565
Okay.

811
00:47:24,608 --> 00:47:26,041
They had it in blue. But...

812
00:47:38,422 --> 00:47:40,049
Just a little
further away.

813
00:47:46,296 --> 00:47:47,285
Okay.

814
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:48,854
All right, come on.

815
00:47:48,932 --> 00:47:50,490
Okay.

816
00:47:50,567 --> 00:47:52,626
Let's go upstairs
and meet Roderick.

817
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:54,059
Okay.

818
00:47:57,507 --> 00:47:58,974
Hello.

819
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:10,280
Honey.

820
00:48:17,794 --> 00:48:18,886
Hi.

821
00:48:18,962 --> 00:48:19,986
Hey.

822
00:48:20,697 --> 00:48:21,686
I don't think we've met.

823
00:48:21,765 --> 00:48:23,426
Oh, yes, we have.

824
00:48:24,434 --> 00:48:27,096
Burning Man, '97.

825
00:48:31,675 --> 00:48:33,006
This is a big bed.

826
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:36,903
We are a Continuum home.

827
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:39,944
What is that?
Continuum?

828
00:48:40,017 --> 00:48:41,143
Continuum?

829
00:48:41,218 --> 00:48:42,242
Yes.

830
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:44,954
Continuum.

831
00:48:45,022 --> 00:48:46,011
Yes.

832
00:48:47,391 --> 00:48:50,451
The Continuum
movement recognizes that

833
00:48:50,527 --> 00:48:55,829
the world will give your baby plenty
of alienation and despair in good time,

834
00:48:55,899 --> 00:48:58,197
so while we can, we
should hold them close.

835
00:48:58,268 --> 00:49:03,535
So, it's the three "S's," no
separation, no sugar, no strollers.

836
00:49:05,309 --> 00:49:07,004
They gave us a stroller.

837
00:49:07,077 --> 00:49:08,066
Oh!

838
00:49:10,213 --> 00:49:11,680
What is wrong
with strollers?

839
00:49:12,749 --> 00:49:16,810
Burts, I love my babies.

840
00:49:16,887 --> 00:49:19,879
Why would I want to
push them away from me?

841
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:25,284
And you wonder why this
country is so dysfunctional.

842
00:49:25,362 --> 00:49:26,829
Because of strollers?

843
00:49:26,897 --> 00:49:28,762
Mama,

844
00:49:28,832 --> 00:49:32,199
in this house
we carry our babies.

845
00:49:32,569 --> 00:49:34,662
We hold them close.

846
00:49:34,738 --> 00:49:35,898
What about sleeping?

847
00:49:37,774 --> 00:49:40,937
This is where they sleep.
We practice family bed.

848
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:45,346
So what if the two
of you want to,

849
00:49:45,415 --> 00:49:47,110
you know? Be alone?

850
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:50,453
Do you go
out to the car?

851
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:53,152
No, Verona.

852
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:55,380
We don't go
out to the car.

853
00:49:56,994 --> 00:50:00,054
Are you planning on hiding
your lovemaking from your kids?

854
00:50:01,932 --> 00:50:03,490
Are you guys
making love?

855
00:50:04,935 --> 00:50:07,062
It can be so great
in the sixth month.

856
00:50:07,137 --> 00:50:08,161
Hmm.

857
00:50:08,238 --> 00:50:11,036
And it is so important to
expose your kids to sexuality,

858
00:50:11,108 --> 00:50:13,076
especially in utero.

859
00:50:13,143 --> 00:50:16,169
Do you know what
it does to a child

860
00:50:16,246 --> 00:50:18,680
to have their parents'
expression of love kept a secret?

861
00:50:19,216 --> 00:50:20,205
No.

862
00:50:20,283 --> 00:50:22,410
Oh! Well,

863
00:50:22,986 --> 00:50:24,613
that's why I have
an Electra complex.

864
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:26,246
Oh, babe.

865
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:29,190
It is okay.
It's okay.

866
00:50:29,259 --> 00:50:31,090
Which one's that, again?

867
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:34,096
I think that is when a
woman wants to do her father.

868
00:50:34,798 --> 00:50:37,096
Do you mean
"Oedipal complex"?

869
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:41,936
Don't... Don't try
and diagnose me, Verona.

870
00:50:43,573 --> 00:50:45,871
Why the seahorses, Rod?

871
00:50:45,942 --> 00:50:47,842
In the seahorse community,

872
00:50:49,946 --> 00:50:51,709
the males give birth.

873
00:50:52,749 --> 00:50:57,777
The female inserts her ovipositor
into the male's brood pouch.

874
00:50:58,321 --> 00:51:00,482
That's where she
deposits her eggs.

875
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:02,252
If I could,

876
00:51:03,627 --> 00:51:07,085
I would lay my eggs
in your brood pouch.

877
00:51:07,164 --> 00:51:08,688
I know you would.

878
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:13,730
Don't...

879
00:51:15,105 --> 00:51:18,563
Don't, don't, don't.

880
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:30,352
So, have you
chosen a doula?

881
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:33,048
I already had one.
A little weird, but good.

882
00:51:33,123 --> 00:51:35,353
A doula, Burtie,
not a dolma.

883
00:51:36,893 --> 00:51:38,827
We are not using a doula.

884
00:51:38,895 --> 00:51:41,295
Really?
Who is your midwife?

885
00:51:41,531 --> 00:51:45,661
Oh, no, no. Midwives and doulas
are for when the husband is clueless

886
00:51:45,735 --> 00:51:46,724
or doesn't want
to be involved.

887
00:51:46,803 --> 00:51:49,271
And I'm neither
of those things.

888
00:51:49,339 --> 00:51:51,307
I'm really looking
forward to being involved.

889
00:51:51,374 --> 00:51:54,400
That's great, Burtie. I totally
understand, and I think that's great,

890
00:51:54,478 --> 00:51:57,606
but don't you think Verona
might want someone there

891
00:51:57,681 --> 00:52:00,616
who really understands
the female experience?

892
00:52:00,684 --> 00:52:04,245
Oh! There's this great
Simone de Beauvoir quote.

893
00:52:04,321 --> 00:52:05,913
I can't remember the book,
but I'll find it for you.

894
00:52:05,989 --> 00:52:10,983
It's something like, "One is not
born, but becomes, a woman. ' '

895
00:52:13,096 --> 00:52:14,188
What does that
have to do with...

896
00:52:14,264 --> 00:52:15,561
But it is worth it.

897
00:52:15,665 --> 00:52:19,032
The pain is so enlightening. And
now, having experienced childbirth,

898
00:52:19,102 --> 00:52:23,300
I watch CNN and I really
feel like I understand war.

899
00:52:24,341 --> 00:52:28,869
On top of which, when I had Wolfie,
I had the most enormous orgasm.

900
00:52:29,279 --> 00:52:31,247
It was so beautiful.

901
00:52:35,952 --> 00:52:37,977
This soup is delicious.

902
00:52:38,054 --> 00:52:43,651
Alice Walker said, "There's nothing more
important than how we enter this world. ' '

903
00:52:43,727 --> 00:52:45,718
And I agree with her.

904
00:52:45,795 --> 00:52:47,990
And my mom had
a hospital birth.

905
00:52:48,064 --> 00:52:51,556
The stirrups, the machines, the drugs.

906
00:52:52,269 --> 00:52:56,831
And she wonders why I can't walk
into a dry cleaner's without vomiting.

907
00:52:57,807 --> 00:53:02,176
Okay, can that maybe be the last bit
of parental advice we get tonight?

908
00:53:02,245 --> 00:53:03,837
Just a... Just a thought.

909
00:53:04,381 --> 00:53:08,943
Honey? Are you counting on
this job interview tomorrow?

910
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:10,418
Where is it?

911
00:53:10,487 --> 00:53:12,887
Mutual Choice.
No, not really.

912
00:53:13,557 --> 00:53:14,546
Because I'm already
doing fine.

913
00:53:14,624 --> 00:53:17,115
This would just be
a better commission rate.

914
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:19,526
Commission rate.

915
00:53:21,798 --> 00:53:25,097
What is it again, exactly,
that you do, Rod?

916
00:53:25,168 --> 00:53:28,535
What do you mean?
How do I "make my living"?

917
00:53:28,605 --> 00:53:29,765
Yes. That's exactly what I mean.

918
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:32,239
Don't worry, Wolf. You won't ever
have to do anything like that.

919
00:53:32,309 --> 00:53:34,277
- Like... "Anything like that"?
- Roderick...

920
00:53:34,945 --> 00:53:36,310
Like fearmongering.

921
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:37,403
Fearmongering?

922
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,004
- Or skimming.
- Roderick, honey?

923
00:53:39,082 --> 00:53:40,106
Cajoling? Billing?

924
00:53:40,183 --> 00:53:41,172
Roderick...

925
00:53:41,251 --> 00:53:42,479
Are you being serious?

926
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:43,849
Roderick, Roderick.

927
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,912
It's so easy to forget how great
the economic divide is these days.

928
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:49,481
These guys have nothing.

929
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:52,255
How should we expect them to
know anything about anything?

930
00:53:52,329 --> 00:53:54,490
And Verona lost her parents.

931
00:53:56,466 --> 00:53:59,196
Honey, how old were you
when they died?

932
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:01,870
Twenty-two. Why?

933
00:54:01,938 --> 00:54:03,462
Oh, you poor thing.

934
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:07,670
I was just wondering how much your
mama was able to pass on to you

935
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:09,712
about motherhood
before she died.

936
00:54:09,779 --> 00:54:13,271
Your people have such a
wonderful oral tradition.

937
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:16,410
Okay, that's it!
That's it!

938
00:54:16,486 --> 00:54:21,389
You are a terrible person. Did you
know that? You are terrible people.

939
00:54:21,458 --> 00:54:24,916
And Verona? She is twice
the woman that you'll ever be!

940
00:54:24,995 --> 00:54:28,624
Because this whole thing... I just...
I never... I'm sorry because...

941
00:54:28,698 --> 00:54:31,861
And this guy!
Look at him!

942
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:37,438
Oh, honey.

943
00:54:37,507 --> 00:54:39,372
Burt.

944
00:54:39,843 --> 00:54:43,643
We are leaving.
And I hate these slippers!

945
00:54:44,347 --> 00:54:45,609
What is going on?

946
00:54:45,849 --> 00:54:50,081
You know what? If I have to explain
it to you Looney Tunes, just forget it.

947
00:54:50,153 --> 00:54:53,816
All right.
Just fly away, Burtie.

948
00:54:55,025 --> 00:54:59,325
Fly away. And take that
shitty stroller with you.

949
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:03,321
Gladly! You fucking lunatic!

950
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:06,762
Actually,
I forgot something!

951
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:12,330
Burt, honey.
Honey, what are you doing?

952
00:55:12,409 --> 00:55:14,400
Hey, Wolfie. Want to
get in the stroller?

953
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:15,739
Wolfie, you... No...

954
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:17,279
Just take
a little ride.

955
00:55:17,347 --> 00:55:18,541
Wolfie, don't listen to him. It's okay.

956
00:55:18,615 --> 00:55:19,980
It will be really fun,
like a tiny sports car.

957
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:21,347
Do not get out
of that chair.

958
00:55:21,418 --> 00:55:22,407
Honey, you do
exactly as you like.

959
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:24,282
Sweetheart. Sweetheart!
Listen to your heart!

960
00:55:24,354 --> 00:55:25,378
Listen to your heart...

961
00:55:25,455 --> 00:55:26,683
There we go!

962
00:55:26,756 --> 00:55:28,747
Not in this house! No! I'm
gonna go in the stroller!

963
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:30,452
No! I will not let
you do that in my house!

964
00:55:31,628 --> 00:55:33,926
That's good!
And there he goes!

965
00:55:34,464 --> 00:55:38,628
Burt, Burt...
I reject your aggression.

966
00:55:38,702 --> 00:55:42,069
I reject your
unbelievable bullshit!

967
00:55:42,138 --> 00:55:43,628
No! Wolfie!
Yes!

968
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:46,065
Wolfie,
did you have fun?

969
00:55:46,142 --> 00:55:50,135
Because you won't have that much
fun until you discover oral pleasure!

970
00:55:50,814 --> 00:55:52,111
This was great!

971
00:55:54,818 --> 00:55:56,809
What a horse's ass.

972
00:55:58,655 --> 00:55:59,644
That was cool.

973
00:55:59,723 --> 00:56:01,247
Oh, my God.
Thank you.

974
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:22,678
- Hi.
- Hey.

975
00:56:22,746 --> 00:56:23,838
So, how did it go?

976
00:56:23,913 --> 00:56:24,937
Good.

977
00:56:25,014 --> 00:56:26,481
- Yeah?
- Really good.

978
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:28,476
So, did they
offer you the job?

979
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:29,575
Yeah.

980
00:56:29,652 --> 00:56:31,210
- Yeah?
- They probably will.

981
00:56:31,287 --> 00:56:33,721
I just need some time to
think about it a little bit.

982
00:56:36,659 --> 00:56:38,889
So, they're probably
going to offer you the job?

983
00:56:38,962 --> 00:56:43,524
They are ready to. They just need
a couple of days for arrangements

984
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:45,463
and formalities.

985
00:56:47,604 --> 00:56:49,299
So, they didn't
offer you the job?

986
00:56:49,372 --> 00:56:50,361
No.

987
00:56:53,943 --> 00:56:56,776
I'm really sorry I
brought you here, Verona.

988
00:56:56,846 --> 00:56:58,711
I don't know
what I was thinking.

989
00:56:59,983 --> 00:57:01,075
Burt.

990
00:57:02,385 --> 00:57:04,012
It is not your fault.

991
00:57:05,722 --> 00:57:08,452
So, this place isn't for us.
So, now we know.

992
00:57:09,893 --> 00:57:13,829
I think Montreal is going
to be way better. It will.

993
00:57:15,598 --> 00:57:17,463
You know what I hear
they have in Montreal?

994
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:21,035
You know what they put
on their French fries there?

995
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:22,230
Mayonnaise?

996
00:57:22,305 --> 00:57:24,466
Nope. Better.

997
00:57:26,242 --> 00:57:27,368
Gravy.

998
00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:42,915
You know, I had a dream
about Montreal last week?

999
00:57:42,992 --> 00:57:44,220
- Really?
- Yeah.

1000
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:45,784
What was it about?

1001
00:57:45,862 --> 00:57:47,193
Well, it was
a bunch of things.

1002
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:48,560
Was I topless in it?

1003
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:49,620
Yes.

1004
00:58:04,681 --> 00:58:05,670
Sorry.

1005
00:58:05,748 --> 00:58:06,976
We did it. Sorry.

1006
00:58:10,453 --> 00:58:11,715
We're just
having a baby.

1007
00:58:12,755 --> 00:58:13,949
It's okay.

1008
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:36,201
Holy shit!

1009
00:58:36,279 --> 00:58:37,769
Is this
their house?

1010
00:58:38,414 --> 00:58:42,510
We went to college with these
guys. How can they be so grown up?

1011
00:58:42,585 --> 00:58:43,847
While we are so...

1012
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:44,944
Stunted?

1013
00:58:46,122 --> 00:58:48,818
Confused? Immature?

1014
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:50,848
American?

1015
00:58:54,797 --> 00:58:55,957
Do it again.

1016
00:58:58,935 --> 00:59:00,027
- That's awesome.
- Wow!

1017
00:59:02,805 --> 00:59:05,535
Hey, Camille. Cammie.
Remember us?

1018
00:59:07,744 --> 00:59:08,802
Should we come in?

1019
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:09,867
Okay.

1020
00:59:09,946 --> 00:59:12,414
They are in their room. Mom's
going to wear a little skirt.

1021
00:59:13,650 --> 00:59:14,742
Okay.

1022
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:29,457
<i>The sun
has gone to bed</i>

1023
00:59:29,532 --> 00:59:33,491
<i>And so must I</i>

1024
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:38,837
<i>So long, farewell</i>

1025
00:59:38,908 --> 00:59:44,175
<i>Auf wiedersehen, goodbye</i>

1026
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:47,141
<i>Goodbye</i>

1027
00:59:47,216 --> 00:59:49,047
There she is.

1028
00:59:50,019 --> 00:59:52,078
- Verona, you look amazing.
- Thanks.

1029
00:59:52,155 --> 00:59:53,952
Perfect. Perfect.

1030
00:59:54,023 --> 00:59:55,490
Hey.

1031
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:56,914
Good to see you.

1032
00:59:56,993 --> 00:59:58,961
It's great to see you.
Here, watch this.

1033
01:00:03,533 --> 01:00:07,367
<i>Goodbye</i>

1034
01:00:09,572 --> 01:00:10,937
All right. Yeah.

1035
01:00:11,007 --> 01:00:12,304
Hey, great job.

1036
01:00:12,375 --> 01:00:14,502
Hey, everybody.
This is Verona and Burt.

1037
01:00:14,577 --> 01:00:15,601
Your mom and I went
to school with them.

1038
01:00:15,678 --> 01:00:16,702
Say hi.

1039
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:17,768
- Hi.
- Hi.

1040
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:19,609
- Get yourselves some pizza.
- Ooh! Pizza.

1041
01:00:19,682 --> 01:00:21,445
Pizza. What's up, James?

1042
01:00:21,517 --> 01:00:22,506
You're in the middle.

1043
01:00:22,585 --> 01:00:26,214
Hey, so, the movie ends when
the von Trapps go to sleep?

1044
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:27,847
Yeah,
we sort of skipped it.

1045
01:00:27,924 --> 01:00:29,016
You skipped
the Nazis?

1046
01:00:29,092 --> 01:00:30,923
We kind of figured,
"What's the point?"

1047
01:00:30,994 --> 01:00:33,224
It is just that we think they
could live a few more happy years

1048
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:36,697
before, you know,
Juicy Couture and Hitler.

1049
01:00:36,766 --> 01:00:39,633
Excuse me. Do you know
the way to San Jose?

1050
01:00:40,169 --> 01:00:41,659
Where did you get that?

1051
01:00:42,672 --> 01:00:43,661
She has never
done this before.

1052
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:45,105
You are seeing this
for the first time.

1053
01:00:45,174 --> 01:00:47,108
Who's underneath?
Who's underneath?

1054
01:00:48,711 --> 01:00:49,973
Come here.

1055
01:00:50,046 --> 01:00:51,274
Tie him up.

1056
01:00:51,848 --> 01:00:54,078
Verona! Verona! Help!

1057
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:55,276
Isn't that cute?

1058
01:00:55,351 --> 01:00:57,216
- Mama! Mama!
- Now what's...

1059
01:00:57,286 --> 01:00:58,275
Hi!

1060
01:00:58,354 --> 01:00:59,651
Hi, Munch.

1061
01:01:01,457 --> 01:01:05,086
Oh, Verona. Look at you!
You look so good!

1062
01:01:05,161 --> 01:01:06,219
Thanks.

1063
01:01:06,295 --> 01:01:07,523
I can't believe you are
six months in. I know.

1064
01:01:07,597 --> 01:01:08,825
You look amazing.
Where's Burt?

1065
01:01:08,898 --> 01:01:10,058
You do, too.

1066
01:01:10,867 --> 01:01:12,835
I think he's been
taken hostage over here.

1067
01:01:12,902 --> 01:01:14,494
Oh, hi.

1068
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:15,559
Are you okay?

1069
01:01:15,872 --> 01:01:19,205
Yeah, I have all this gear
at home. I do this to relax.

1070
01:01:23,146 --> 01:01:27,412
This is the family I want.
Every part of it. All those kids.

1071
01:01:27,483 --> 01:01:30,884
All those ages. Everyone draped over each
other, just taking care of each other.

1072
01:01:30,953 --> 01:01:32,784
- So, you want to adopt?
- Yeah.

1073
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:35,847
All right. So we will just trade this
one in and we will get whatever we want.

1074
01:01:35,925 --> 01:01:39,486
No, I want her and them, too.
This is a family.

1075
01:01:40,096 --> 01:01:42,223
Yeah, it works.
It's real.

1076
01:01:42,298 --> 01:01:44,425
We should move here.
Montreal.

1077
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:45,592
Think of that.

1078
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:55,109
Do you still
find time to go out?

1079
01:01:55,178 --> 01:01:56,770
We're out a lot, I guess.

1080
01:01:56,846 --> 01:01:59,747
I mean, it depends.
You have to find the balance

1081
01:01:59,816 --> 01:02:03,343
because the kids want you
there, but not all the time.

1082
01:02:03,419 --> 01:02:04,909
They need air
as much as you do.

1083
01:02:06,322 --> 01:02:07,448
Should we tell them?

1084
01:02:08,024 --> 01:02:09,457
I think we're moving here.

1085
01:02:09,926 --> 01:02:11,325
- To Montreal?
- Yeah.

1086
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:14,227
We already won the competition.
Over Madison. Over Phoenix.

1087
01:02:14,297 --> 01:02:15,491
Hell, yeah!

1088
01:02:16,666 --> 01:02:18,031
You guys!
That is wonderful!

1089
01:02:18,101 --> 01:02:19,898
Let us toast.
Does anyone know a toast?

1090
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:25,029
Okay. So, yay for Burt
and Verona moving here,

1091
01:02:25,108 --> 01:02:26,905
probably,
if they are not stupid.

1092
01:02:26,976 --> 01:02:28,409
- Yay!
- Yay!

1093
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:32,236
Oh!

1094
01:02:32,315 --> 01:02:33,839
Two more of these?
I love this...

1095
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:35,781
Trombone, man.
I love the trombone.

1096
01:02:35,852 --> 01:02:37,717
- I was just about to say that!
- It is amazing, right?

1097
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:38,844
The 'bone!

1098
01:02:39,789 --> 01:02:42,815
We don't know, actually.
We weren't 100% trying.

1099
01:02:42,892 --> 01:02:44,723
I mean, we wanted
to have a baby.

1100
01:02:44,794 --> 01:02:47,922
It just sort of came
ahead of schedule.

1101
01:02:48,698 --> 01:02:50,723
Have you had any
problems so far?

1102
01:02:51,734 --> 01:02:54,726
No. No. Not so far.

1103
01:02:55,505 --> 01:02:56,938
It's been great.

1104
01:02:57,039 --> 01:02:58,165
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1105
01:02:59,408 --> 01:03:02,070
That's wonderful. That's...

1106
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:06,642
Ladies,
I have an announcement.

1107
01:03:10,086 --> 01:03:11,178
We need real food.

1108
01:03:15,091 --> 01:03:16,752
She said, "Mrs. Farlander,
your husband requests... "

1109
01:03:16,826 --> 01:03:18,054
What do you mean,
"Mrs. Farlander"?

1110
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:19,958
- You're still not married?
- No.

1111
01:03:20,062 --> 01:03:21,757
We talked about this.
We talked about this.

1112
01:03:21,831 --> 01:03:22,855
No. Why don't you propose?

1113
01:03:22,932 --> 01:03:24,024
When are you
going to propose?

1114
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:25,124
Propose?

1115
01:03:25,201 --> 01:03:27,567
All I do is propose.
Are you kidding?

1116
01:03:28,838 --> 01:03:30,635
Watch this.
Watch. Watch this.

1117
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:33,335
- Verona.
- Yeah?

1118
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:34,636
You really are
the love of my life.

1119
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:36,143
Thanks, honey.

1120
01:03:36,212 --> 01:03:37,543
- Will you marry me?
- No.

1121
01:03:38,781 --> 01:03:39,839
- Wow.
- What?

1122
01:03:39,916 --> 01:03:41,577
That actually stings.

1123
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:43,243
Is this true?

1124
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:44,786
It's you who's behind this.

1125
01:03:44,854 --> 01:03:46,048
I can't see the point.

1126
01:03:46,122 --> 01:03:47,248
That's romantic.

1127
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:49,757
Well, there isn't any, really. I mean...

1128
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:52,192
Well, not unless you have parents
who care one way or the other.

1129
01:03:52,261 --> 01:03:53,853
Which you don't.

1130
01:03:53,930 --> 01:03:56,831
But your wedding
was so good.

1131
01:03:56,899 --> 01:03:58,059
- Really good.
- Yeah, it was.

1132
01:03:58,134 --> 01:04:00,694
It was really good. The wedding
was good. Marriage is great.

1133
01:04:00,770 --> 01:04:05,173
But what you need to be
happy, and sane, is this.

1134
01:04:06,209 --> 01:04:08,074
- What is that?
- This?

1135
01:04:08,177 --> 01:04:12,375
Okay, watch this.
Here is you two guys.

1136
01:04:12,448 --> 01:04:13,472
Really?

1137
01:04:13,549 --> 01:04:14,538
No...

1138
01:04:14,617 --> 01:04:16,016
Okay, here is
you two guys.

1139
01:04:16,085 --> 01:04:17,074
Stop.

1140
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:22,287
Okay, so you kiss, you do other
things and then you make a baby.

1141
01:04:22,558 --> 01:04:24,753
The baby comes in
there and he nestles in.

1142
01:04:24,827 --> 01:04:28,661
And you guys hug and get real
tight. And then we do this.

1143
01:04:28,731 --> 01:04:32,599
And this. There...

1144
01:04:33,569 --> 01:04:35,059
- And this...
- Are those the bedposts?

1145
01:04:36,372 --> 01:04:39,034
It's your house.
Now what is this?

1146
01:04:39,976 --> 01:04:41,273
- Is that a home? Is that a family?
- Yeah.

1147
01:04:41,344 --> 01:04:44,108
No. No, of course not.
That's just the raw material.

1148
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:46,910
The people, the walls, the
furniture. Okay, so that's the basics.

1149
01:04:46,983 --> 01:04:49,577
But that's not a home.
That's not a family.

1150
01:04:49,652 --> 01:04:51,984
What binds it all
together is this.

1151
01:04:52,054 --> 01:04:54,386
Awesome.
That's awesome.

1152
01:04:55,524 --> 01:04:57,515
- This is love.
- I knew it.

1153
01:04:58,361 --> 01:04:59,953
Yes, here we go.

1154
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:02,254
This is your love, guys.

1155
01:05:02,331 --> 01:05:05,664
Here it comes. The patience, your
consideration, your better selves.

1156
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:08,226
Man, you just have no idea
how good you can be.

1157
01:05:08,304 --> 01:05:10,431
But you have to use all of it.
All of it.

1158
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:11,937
It's not like simple masonry,

1159
01:05:12,008 --> 01:05:14,374
where you use a little layer of
mortar between each row of bricks.

1160
01:05:14,443 --> 01:05:16,434
No. With this,
you have to use tons of it.

1161
01:05:16,512 --> 01:05:19,242
For every brick, there's
a half-ton of mortar.

1162
01:05:19,582 --> 01:05:20,776
I thought
we were doing syrup.

1163
01:05:22,285 --> 01:05:26,278
Mortar, syrup. Syrup, mortar. It
is all the same. It's the glue.

1164
01:05:27,323 --> 01:05:29,587
It's all those good
things you have in you.

1165
01:05:30,259 --> 01:05:31,487
The love,

1166
01:05:32,194 --> 01:05:35,061
the wisdom, the generosity.
The selflessness.

1167
01:05:35,131 --> 01:05:37,998
The patience. Patience.

1168
01:05:38,067 --> 01:05:41,503
At 3:00 a. m. when everyone's
awake because Ibrahim is sick

1169
01:05:41,570 --> 01:05:44,664
and he can't find the bathroom
and he just puked in Katya's bed.

1170
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:46,901
- Patience when you blink...
- It was awful.

1171
01:05:47,443 --> 01:05:50,879
When you blink and it's 5:30
and it is time to get up again,

1172
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:55,008
and you know you're going to be tired
all day, all week, all your fucking life.

1173
01:05:55,084 --> 01:05:57,450
And you are thinking,
"What happened to Greece?

1174
01:05:58,020 --> 01:06:01,421
"What happened to swimming
naked off the coast of Greece?"

1175
01:06:03,592 --> 01:06:08,620
And you have to be willing to make
the family out of whatever you have.

1176
01:06:12,668 --> 01:06:15,193
You have to be so much
better than you ever thought.

1177
01:06:18,874 --> 01:06:20,034
Right?

1178
01:06:22,878 --> 01:06:24,607
Wow, I've never
done this before.

1179
01:06:25,514 --> 01:06:26,811
It's like dance karaoke?

1180
01:06:26,882 --> 01:06:28,406
It's Montreal.

1181
01:06:28,484 --> 01:06:30,782
World capital
of this kind of shit.

1182
01:06:30,853 --> 01:06:32,480
Montreal, baby.

1183
01:06:32,555 --> 01:06:35,615
Oh! Now listen, are there going
to be any... Is this just dudes?

1184
01:06:35,691 --> 01:06:37,750
No, no, no. It's not that
those guys weren't enjoyable.

1185
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:39,226
No, plenty of girls coming.
I swear.

1186
01:06:39,295 --> 01:06:40,284
Okay.

1187
01:06:40,763 --> 01:06:43,027
I hope so.
No, there's girls coming.

1188
01:06:43,566 --> 01:06:44,624
Where's 'Rona?

1189
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:45,724
I think
she's in the bathroom.

1190
01:06:45,801 --> 01:06:46,995
Where's Munch?

1191
01:06:47,069 --> 01:06:48,559
I have no fucking idea.

1192
01:06:49,705 --> 01:06:51,138
Uh-oh.

1193
01:07:23,906 --> 01:07:25,134
She had another miscarriage.

1194
01:07:27,443 --> 01:07:28,637
What?

1195
01:07:29,912 --> 01:07:31,880
When?

1196
01:07:31,947 --> 01:07:32,936
Thursday.

1197
01:07:33,849 --> 01:07:36,181
This Thursday?

1198
01:07:36,252 --> 01:07:37,241
Yeah.

1199
01:07:40,156 --> 01:07:41,453
This is her fifth.

1200
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:49,892
I know she loves all those kids
like they were her own blood,

1201
01:07:53,669 --> 01:07:55,603
but I wonder if we
have been selfish.

1202
01:07:55,671 --> 01:07:58,037
People like us,
we wait until our 30s,

1203
01:07:58,107 --> 01:08:02,567
and then we are surprised when the
babies aren't so easy to make anymore.

1204
01:08:02,645 --> 01:08:08,982
And every day another million
14-year-olds get pregnant without trying.

1205
01:08:15,024 --> 01:08:17,686
It's terrible feeling
this helpless, man.

1206
01:08:20,996 --> 01:08:24,625
You just watch these
babies grow, and then...

1207
01:08:31,273 --> 01:08:32,672
Then fade.

1208
01:08:36,378 --> 01:08:40,007
And you don't know if
you're supposed to name them

1209
01:08:40,749 --> 01:08:42,307
or bury them, or...

1210
01:08:49,058 --> 01:08:50,389
I'm sorry.

1211
01:09:49,552 --> 01:09:51,486
Well, you have
every right to be pissed.

1212
01:09:52,421 --> 01:09:53,547
Or worse.

1213
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:57,659
Yeah...
Damn right, I'll be there.

1214
01:09:57,726 --> 01:09:59,921
You're my brother,
for God's sake. Come on.

1215
01:10:00,329 --> 01:10:04,163
This afternoon. Yeah, well, we're
leaving as soon as 'Rona wakes up.

1216
01:10:05,901 --> 01:10:10,065
No, will you stop? Hey, you're
always paying, all right?

1217
01:10:10,139 --> 01:10:12,164
I'll pay. I can swing it.

1218
01:10:12,474 --> 01:10:14,408
Wait, hold on a second.
I think she is up.

1219
01:10:15,377 --> 01:10:17,402
- What's going on?
- It's my brother.

1220
01:10:17,479 --> 01:10:19,777
I'm telling her right now.
Helena left him.

1221
01:10:19,848 --> 01:10:20,872
What?

1222
01:10:20,950 --> 01:10:22,144
We're going to Miami.

1223
01:10:23,786 --> 01:10:24,878
What happened?

1224
01:10:37,066 --> 01:10:41,696
I spy with my little eye

1225
01:10:41,770 --> 01:10:44,830
something that is blue.

1226
01:10:46,141 --> 01:10:47,768
You... You didn't see
this coming, did you?

1227
01:10:47,843 --> 01:10:49,208
I mean,
she was normal, right?

1228
01:10:49,278 --> 01:10:51,371
Oh, yeah.
Definitely. Yeah.

1229
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:54,374
Do you have any idea how many
times I've checked my messages?

1230
01:10:54,450 --> 01:10:56,384
It's a tick now. It's,
like, 10 times an hour.

1231
01:10:56,452 --> 01:10:59,080
I've got all the lines
bouncing to my cell.

1232
01:10:59,154 --> 01:11:02,783
The weird thing is,
part of me is so angry,

1233
01:11:02,858 --> 01:11:04,689
I never want to hear
her name again.

1234
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:06,352
But if she came back tomorrow
and said she was sorry,

1235
01:11:06,428 --> 01:11:09,522
I would be so
fucking relieved.

1236
01:11:11,066 --> 01:11:12,590
Well, Annabelle seems
to be doing great.

1237
01:11:13,636 --> 01:11:15,433
I know.
It's even weirder.

1238
01:11:15,504 --> 01:11:16,835
Well, what
did you tell her?

1239
01:11:16,905 --> 01:11:18,600
I told her
it was a business trip.

1240
01:11:18,674 --> 01:11:21,108
I made the mistake of telling
her she'd be five days.

1241
01:11:21,176 --> 01:11:22,734
I actually thought that
was a conservative estimate.

1242
01:11:22,811 --> 01:11:24,574
I thought I would have
it figured out by then.

1243
01:11:25,381 --> 01:11:28,373
But then five days go by and she
wants to know where her mom is.

1244
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:30,577
So I told her
that Grandpa died.

1245
01:11:30,653 --> 01:11:31,677
You told her Dad died?

1246
01:11:31,754 --> 01:11:33,517
No, no, no,
Helena's father.

1247
01:11:33,589 --> 01:11:34,578
Oh!

1248
01:11:34,690 --> 01:11:36,681
Listen, Burt,

1249
01:11:38,594 --> 01:11:39,822
I really need your help.

1250
01:11:39,895 --> 01:11:42,489
I mean, if she's
really gone for good,

1251
01:11:42,564 --> 01:11:44,259
I gotta know
what to tell Belle.

1252
01:11:44,333 --> 01:11:47,427
And it is wrong to say that
her mom was murdered, right?

1253
01:11:48,937 --> 01:11:51,804
Yes. I think that
would be traumatic.

1254
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:54,632
Yeah, but there's
finality there.

1255
01:11:55,444 --> 01:12:00,074
"Where is my crown?
I simply cannot find my crown.

1256
01:12:01,250 --> 01:12:04,447
"Oh, brother, I just
swallowed another fly. ' '

1257
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:07,045
And to that
the crab replied...

1258
01:12:07,122 --> 01:12:09,920
"You will never find
your crown, Frog,

1259
01:12:09,992 --> 01:12:13,052
"because I have hid
it under the ocean. ' '

1260
01:12:14,530 --> 01:12:16,020
And then they fought.

1261
01:12:16,098 --> 01:12:18,066
"Give me your tongue.
Give me your tongue, Frog. ' '

1262
01:12:18,133 --> 01:12:19,122
"That's my tongue. ' '
"I have your tongue. ' '

1263
01:12:19,201 --> 01:12:21,226
And then they made up. "Bullfrog,
I have to admit something.

1264
01:12:21,303 --> 01:12:23,134
"You're my best friend. ' '
"I still love you. ' '

1265
01:12:23,205 --> 01:12:25,639
"I'm really sorry about that, Frog.
I've always loved your eyes. ' '

1266
01:12:25,708 --> 01:12:26,697
"Don't
worry about it. ' '

1267
01:12:28,110 --> 01:12:29,839
"Thank you very much. ' ' "Thank
you. Thank you very much. ' '

1268
01:12:29,912 --> 01:12:32,210
"Thank you. Be sure
to tip your waitress. ' '

1269
01:12:32,514 --> 01:12:34,345
Say good night
to Uncle Burp and Verona.

1270
01:12:34,416 --> 01:12:35,974
- Good night, Bella.
- Good night, Daddy.

1271
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:39,453
- Good night, Bella.
- Good night.

1272
01:12:39,521 --> 01:12:40,852
Good night, chicken.

1273
01:12:43,325 --> 01:12:45,691
Could you stay a little longer?

1274
01:12:45,761 --> 01:12:46,750
Sure.

1275
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:48,557
I'll stay with you.

1276
01:12:50,833 --> 01:12:55,998
<i>Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man
play a song for me</i>

1277
01:12:56,305 --> 01:13:02,335
<i>I'm not sleepy and there
is no place I'm going to</i>

1278
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:04,770
<i>Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man</i>

1279
01:13:04,847 --> 01:13:06,212
Thank you.

1280
01:13:07,383 --> 01:13:09,374
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1281
01:13:09,451 --> 01:13:15,048
<i>In the jingle jangle morning
I'll come followin' you</i>

1282
01:13:16,658 --> 01:13:18,558
- Did you see this?
- What's that?

1283
01:13:19,795 --> 01:13:21,387
Oh, wow!
Look at that.

1284
01:13:22,664 --> 01:13:24,495
Man, she is so cute.

1285
01:13:24,566 --> 01:13:25,555
Yeah.

1286
01:13:26,034 --> 01:13:27,501
She just took
that on Monday.

1287
01:13:27,569 --> 01:13:29,434
Remember when we had to wait
weeks for the school pictures?

1288
01:13:29,505 --> 01:13:31,336
Oh, yeah. It was...

1289
01:13:33,375 --> 01:13:36,970
Hey. What's that on her lip?

1290
01:13:40,315 --> 01:13:41,782
Carrot juice.

1291
01:13:42,751 --> 01:13:44,218
Carrot juice.

1292
01:13:45,287 --> 01:13:47,152
Yeah, so that's
the picture.

1293
01:13:47,756 --> 01:13:49,121
Oh!

1294
01:13:52,394 --> 01:13:56,831
Yeah, I didn't see the carrot juice
on her mouth when she left the house.

1295
01:13:56,965 --> 01:13:59,661
I'm never going
to see stuff like that.

1296
01:14:01,637 --> 01:14:05,004
Moms see the carrot juice
on their daughters' mouths.

1297
01:14:05,808 --> 01:14:08,038
Moms know when they
aren't dressed right.

1298
01:14:08,777 --> 01:14:13,441
Moms go shopping with them, and make
sure their hair doesn't look all spazzy.

1299
01:14:13,549 --> 01:14:15,312
In one fell swoop,
Helena has changed

1300
01:14:15,384 --> 01:14:17,477
this girl's life
from a normal one,

1301
01:14:17,553 --> 01:14:19,885
where she can be
popular and all that,

1302
01:14:19,955 --> 01:14:23,652
to the distinct likelihood that
she's going to be introverted.

1303
01:14:24,793 --> 01:14:26,283
A poor dresser.

1304
01:14:28,864 --> 01:14:31,298
One of those kids
that looks all longingly

1305
01:14:31,366 --> 01:14:34,824
at the girls with the new
shoes and the right backpack.

1306
01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:39,600
Well, at least it's just
carrot juice, right?

1307
01:14:40,442 --> 01:14:44,071
I mean,
it's not whiskey or glue.

1308
01:14:44,413 --> 01:14:46,711
It's just the beginning,
though.

1309
01:14:47,783 --> 01:14:53,380
I'm going to be spending every waking
moment trying to reconstruct a normal life.

1310
01:14:55,457 --> 01:15:01,555
But that little girl in there will
always be the girl without a mom.

1311
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:06,631
<i>Into my own parade cast
your dancing spell my way</i>

1312
01:15:06,702 --> 01:15:10,297
<i>I promise to go under it</i>

1313
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:17,537

<i>In the jingle jangle morning
I'll come followin' you</i>

1317
01:15:42,170 --> 01:15:44,434
Yeah? Well, the fact that
I'm even calling this late

1318
01:15:44,506 --> 01:15:46,633
means it's important,
doesn't it?

1319
01:15:46,708 --> 01:15:47,970
I think so.

1320
01:15:48,477 --> 01:15:52,641
What's your name? I already know,
'cause I... Listen, you know what?

1321
01:15:53,115 --> 01:15:55,447
Well, I think you know more than
you're letting on. How about that?

1322
01:15:55,517 --> 01:15:56,506
Burt?

1323
01:15:56,585 --> 01:15:58,416
So... Hello?

1324
01:15:58,487 --> 01:16:00,478
- Burt.
- Damn it!

1325
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:02,990
Burt, what are you doing?

1326
01:16:03,058 --> 01:16:04,719
Calling everyone she knew.

1327
01:16:04,793 --> 01:16:06,488
Her old company. Her friends.

1328
01:16:06,562 --> 01:16:08,029
At midnight?

1329
01:16:08,096 --> 01:16:10,291
Right.
The element of surprise.

1330
01:16:10,999 --> 01:16:12,990
Well, can you
stop, please?

1331
01:16:13,068 --> 01:16:16,435
I mean, what kind of goddamned
person leaves her daughter?

1332
01:16:16,505 --> 01:16:19,941
I don't know. Maybe not such
a strong person. Please stop.

1333
01:16:20,008 --> 01:16:21,566
And you know what
the worst of it is?

1334
01:16:21,643 --> 01:16:23,508
There is nothing
we can do about it.

1335
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:27,606
Because she is gone. And this family
can't be fixed. And that is it.

1336
01:16:27,683 --> 01:16:29,082
And what if one of us
freaks out like that?

1337
01:16:29,151 --> 01:16:30,516
We won't.

1338
01:16:30,586 --> 01:16:32,952
It can be fixed.
And you know it.

1339
01:16:35,524 --> 01:16:36,855
Thank you.

1340
01:16:41,863 --> 01:16:42,921
Burt.

1341
01:16:45,867 --> 01:16:47,129
It's okay.

1342
01:16:49,371 --> 01:16:51,066
Look at me, please.

1343
01:16:52,641 --> 01:16:53,938
But really?

1344
01:16:54,509 --> 01:16:59,276
I mean, what if something happens to
one of us and just makes us go crazy?

1345
01:16:59,514 --> 01:17:04,178
I mean, what if I'm walking by a
construction site and something falls,

1346
01:17:04,252 --> 01:17:08,018
and then my frontal lobe gets chopped
off and my personality's altered

1347
01:17:08,090 --> 01:17:10,251
and then I'm not a good dad?

1348
01:17:11,093 --> 01:17:12,651
What happens then?

1349
01:17:12,728 --> 01:17:16,027
Well, be careful walking
near construction sites.

1350
01:17:18,066 --> 01:17:19,556
What about Munch?

1351
01:17:20,535 --> 01:17:22,799
She'll be careful walking
near construction sites, too.

1352
01:17:22,904 --> 01:17:24,303
No, really.

1353
01:17:25,540 --> 01:17:27,371
I mean, don't you just look
at her and want to give her

1354
01:17:27,442 --> 01:17:29,842
everything that
she's ever wanted?

1355
01:17:31,647 --> 01:17:33,444
It is so incredibly
unfair that she can't...

1356
01:17:33,515 --> 01:17:35,608
Yeah, you're right.

1357
01:17:35,851 --> 01:17:39,287
It's unfair that
she can't have a baby

1358
01:17:39,388 --> 01:17:43,518
and that bad parents
still get to be parents

1359
01:17:44,593 --> 01:17:48,495
and good parents die when their
daughters are in college. So what?

1360
01:17:48,997 --> 01:17:50,225
I'm sorry, 'Rona.

1361
01:17:50,298 --> 01:17:54,166
Look, all we can do is
be good for this one baby.

1362
01:17:56,138 --> 01:17:58,698
We don't have control
over much else.

1363
01:17:59,574 --> 01:18:02,634
Will you marry me?
At least.

1364
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:07,641
Never.

1365
01:18:16,425 --> 01:18:18,484
- I will never leave you.
- Yeah.

1366
01:18:20,762 --> 01:18:22,024
I promise.

1367
01:18:22,097 --> 01:18:23,291
No, I know.

1368
01:18:27,069 --> 01:18:28,434
You...

1369
01:18:30,138 --> 01:18:33,198
You promised never to marry me
because you don't want to get married

1370
01:18:33,275 --> 01:18:35,971
without your parents there.
I get that.

1371
01:18:37,913 --> 01:18:40,074
You promise
never to leave me.

1372
01:18:42,884 --> 01:18:46,615
Do you promise to never leave
this baby that we are having?

1373
01:18:48,957 --> 01:18:50,185
I promise.

1374
01:18:52,594 --> 01:18:53,788
I do.

1375
01:18:58,133 --> 01:18:59,293
Do you promise

1376
01:19:00,969 --> 01:19:07,772
to stop talking about your ability to find
or not find my vagina after I give birth?

1377
01:19:11,379 --> 01:19:12,437
I do.

1378
01:19:16,985 --> 01:19:18,612
Do you promise
to let me cobble...

1379
01:19:18,687 --> 01:19:19,711
Carve.

1380
01:19:19,788 --> 01:19:23,246
...to carve in my spare time,

1381
01:19:23,492 --> 01:19:26,586
and teach our daughter the
lore of the great Mississippi?

1382
01:19:28,263 --> 01:19:29,423
I do.

1383
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:35,868
Do you promise never to
develop a thing for seahorses?

1384
01:19:38,039 --> 01:19:39,267
I do.

1385
01:19:40,142 --> 01:19:41,268
Good.

1386
01:19:49,684 --> 01:19:54,815
Do you promise to let our
daughter be fat or skinny

1387
01:19:55,824 --> 01:20:00,056
or any weight at all? Because we
want her to be happy, no matter what.

1388
01:20:00,662 --> 01:20:04,496
Being obsessed with weight is
just too clich for our daughter.

1389
01:20:04,633 --> 01:20:05,827
Yes, I do.

1390
01:20:09,437 --> 01:20:12,497
Do you promise,
when she talks,

1391
01:20:13,375 --> 01:20:17,209
you'll listen?
Like, really listen,

1392
01:20:18,947 --> 01:20:20,710
especially when
she's scared?

1393
01:20:22,984 --> 01:20:25,646
And that her fights
will be your fights?

1394
01:20:27,122 --> 01:20:28,316
I do.

1395
01:20:37,933 --> 01:20:41,699
And do you promise that if I die
some embarrassing and boring death

1396
01:20:41,770 --> 01:20:46,469
that you're gonna tell our
daughter that her father was killed

1397
01:20:46,541 --> 01:20:51,410
by Russian soldiers in this
intense hand-to-hand combat

1398
01:20:51,479 --> 01:20:57,076
in an attempt to save the
lives of 850 Chechnyan orphans?

1399
01:20:59,354 --> 01:21:00,514
I do.

1400
01:21:01,523 --> 01:21:04,014
Chechnyan orphans. I do.

1401
01:21:05,627 --> 01:21:06,753
I do.

1402
01:22:32,747 --> 01:22:34,146
We had an orange tree.

1403
01:22:35,383 --> 01:22:36,748
Who?

1404
01:22:36,818 --> 01:22:37,944
When we were kids.

1405
01:22:39,921 --> 01:22:42,014
My dad was really
proud of it.

1406
01:22:43,491 --> 01:22:47,860
He planted it one spring, and he used to
go out there first thing every morning,

1407
01:22:47,929 --> 01:22:50,489
see if any oranges had grown.
But nothing ever grew.

1408
01:22:52,167 --> 01:22:54,897
The thing was sickly or something,
or the soil wasn't right.

1409
01:22:57,672 --> 01:23:02,302
One morning, my mom woke
Grace and me up really early,

1410
01:23:02,377 --> 01:23:03,776
like, at 5:00,

1411
01:23:05,046 --> 01:23:10,780
and she led us out to the tree with these
two grocery bags filled with oranges,

1412
01:23:11,586 --> 01:23:15,545
and pineapples and grapes
and melons, for some reason.

1413
01:23:16,391 --> 01:23:21,488
And we just hung all the fruit
from the tree using tape and string.

1414
01:23:22,731 --> 01:23:24,824
It worked, actually.

1415
01:23:26,968 --> 01:23:29,732
And then we all ran into the
truck and we slouched down

1416
01:23:29,804 --> 01:23:32,272
and we just waited
for my dad to come out.

1417
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:33,398
What did he say?

1418
01:23:33,475 --> 01:23:35,943
Well, he stared
at it for a full minute,

1419
01:23:37,012 --> 01:23:39,776
just staring at it.

1420
01:23:41,883 --> 01:23:44,818
I think at first
he thought they were real,

1421
01:23:44,886 --> 01:23:47,047
like the tree had burst
into fruit overnight,

1422
01:23:50,592 --> 01:23:53,425
and then, I guess he saw
the pineapples or something,

1423
01:23:55,830 --> 01:23:59,926
and he just started laughing harder
than we'd ever heard him laugh.

1424
01:24:01,836 --> 01:24:06,068
And Grace and I just ran
out of the truck, squealing.

1425
01:24:08,276 --> 01:24:09,937
And my mom just...

1426
01:24:18,787 --> 01:24:20,846
And from then on,

1427
01:24:21,956 --> 01:24:25,289
every once in a while one of
us would hang fruit from there.

1428
01:24:26,394 --> 01:24:30,797
Usually something
plastic, like pears

1429
01:24:32,967 --> 01:24:34,832
or strawberries
or bananas.

1430
01:25:11,539 --> 01:25:13,666
Is this starting
to look familiar?

1431
01:25:14,409 --> 01:25:17,537
I think so.
God, I want it to.

1432
01:25:17,612 --> 01:25:19,910
But I want it to be new.
You know?

1433
01:25:20,515 --> 01:25:21,812
New for us.

1434
01:25:22,150 --> 01:25:25,608
New enough to feel
like we found it.

1435
01:25:27,055 --> 01:25:28,920
Does that make sense?

1436
01:25:29,724 --> 01:25:30,850
Yeah.

1437
01:26:17,238 --> 01:26:18,432
You ready?

1438
01:26:21,376 --> 01:26:22,502
I am.

1439
01:26:23,711 --> 01:26:24,939
Are you?

1440
01:26:26,181 --> 01:26:27,546
Yes, I am.

1441
01:26:47,135 --> 01:26:48,932
God, I forgot
how beautiful it is.

1442
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:23,152
This place is
perfect for us.

1443
01:29:26,761 --> 01:29:28,058
Don't you think?

1444
01:29:35,503 --> 01:29:36,800
I hope so.

1445
01:29:42,510 --> 01:29:44,137
I really fucking hope so.

1446
01:30:01,074 --> 01:30:05,222
