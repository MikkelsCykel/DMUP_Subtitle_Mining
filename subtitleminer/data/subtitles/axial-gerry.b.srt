You okay?

1
00:00:04,598 --> 00:00:06,657
Yeah.
[Breathing heavily]

2
00:00:06,734 --> 00:00:08,702
What time do you think it is?

3
00:00:08,769 --> 00:00:10,828
That was far.

4
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,315
Here.

5
00:02:43,056 --> 00:02:45,251
Animal tracks.

6
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,750
Follow these to water.

7
00:02:47,828 --> 00:02:51,093
Animals have to know
where the water is out here.

8
00:02:51,932 --> 00:02:53,900
Then we follow them
to the water,

9
00:02:53,967 --> 00:02:58,802
and we just drink our faces up.

10
00:02:58,872 --> 00:03:02,364
Or else they go to the mating
grounds, you know, and...

11
00:03:04,745 --> 00:03:06,542
And then they mate,
and they get thirsty,

12
00:03:06,613 --> 00:03:08,308
and they come back.

13
00:03:09,883 --> 00:03:11,942
All right, but, I mean, I...

14
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:17,780
Yeah.

15
00:03:19,026 --> 00:03:21,051
We don't know how far
the water is, though.

16
00:03:21,128 --> 00:03:23,995
And I don't think we should
abandon the higher-ground idea,

17
00:03:24,064 --> 00:03:25,326
'cause it was a good idea.

18
00:03:25,399 --> 00:03:27,060
And that was a rolling hills
scout-about.

19
00:03:27,134 --> 00:03:28,931
And if we go on a mountain,
like, crow's-nesting,

20
00:03:29,002 --> 00:03:31,129
like that mountain over there...

21
00:03:33,307 --> 00:03:35,502
Yeah, but...

22
00:03:35,575 --> 00:03:37,509
We know where the water is now.

23
00:03:37,577 --> 00:03:40,444
We could just go there,
and then get water

24
00:03:40,514 --> 00:03:45,451
and then go on our mountain,
the mountaintop scout-about,

25
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,851
after we've gotten water.

26
00:03:47,921 --> 00:03:49,684
I think the mountain's
a better idea

27
00:03:49,756 --> 00:03:53,021
because what if we go
to the mating grounds

28
00:03:53,093 --> 00:03:55,220
and they see us
and they get self-conscious,

29
00:03:55,295 --> 00:03:58,264
and then they don't mate?

30
00:03:58,332 --> 00:03:59,856
Then we'll just...

31
00:03:59,933 --> 00:04:02,060
And then
they won't get thirsty...

32
00:04:02,135 --> 00:04:03,363
Whichever way it is,

33
00:04:03,437 --> 00:04:05,962
if we go there,
and it's the mating grounds,

34
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:09,805
then we'll just watch them
from a brush.

35
00:04:09,876 --> 00:04:12,344
They won't know we're there,
they won't have any body shame,

36
00:04:12,412 --> 00:04:14,505
and they'll mate,
and get thirsty,

37
00:04:14,581 --> 00:04:19,678
and then they'll come back,
and lead us to the water.

38
00:04:22,823 --> 00:04:24,882
All right.

39
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:13,195
- [Both breathing heavily]
- Fuck this.

40
00:05:14,441 --> 00:05:17,001
I can't even
see the tracks anymore.

41
00:05:21,581 --> 00:05:23,014
Fuck 'em.

42
00:12:09,289 --> 00:12:11,587
[Grunts]

43
00:12:11,658 --> 00:12:14,593
[Breathing heavily]

44
00:14:38,938 --> 00:14:41,873
Do you think we should
just go over to that mountain?

45
00:14:53,453 --> 00:14:57,150
Just stop crying, man.

46
00:15:41,901 --> 00:15:43,425
Where you going?!

47
00:15:46,572 --> 00:15:48,506
[Voice breaking]
I don't know!

48
00:15:51,377 --> 00:15:53,345
You wanna help?!

49
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,032
Fuck you.

50
00:18:02,108 --> 00:18:03,735
Fuck you.

51
00:19:46,913 --> 00:19:48,642
[Exhales deeply]

52
00:21:36,088 --> 00:21:39,683
We're walking north-northwest...

53
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:41,624
for...

54
00:21:41,694 --> 00:21:45,095
a couple hours... a ways...

55
00:21:45,164 --> 00:21:47,564
But that's been the way we've
been walking the whole time.

56
00:21:47,633 --> 00:21:50,329
I mean, it's been
30 hours of walking.

57
00:21:50,403 --> 00:21:52,132
North-northwest.

58
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,837
- Okay?
- Uh-huh.

59
00:21:55,908 --> 00:21:59,105
We've gotta be fucking close
to the highway.

60
00:22:00,913 --> 00:22:04,041
Yeah.
But we got lost.

61
00:22:04,116 --> 00:22:05,674
I mean, we were going...

62
00:22:05,751 --> 00:22:07,912
We walked our ways,
and maybe it was north.

63
00:22:07,987 --> 00:22:10,649
And then...

64
00:22:10,723 --> 00:22:14,215
We came,
we turned around, and...

65
00:22:14,293 --> 00:22:15,225
We got off...

66
00:22:15,294 --> 00:22:18,024
We started going straight back
down the way we were going.

67
00:22:18,097 --> 00:22:20,622
No, we didn't.
No, no, no, no.

68
00:22:20,699 --> 00:22:23,998
Before we turned around, we
started going down the same way.

69
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:27,506
But we had turned before...

70
00:22:27,573 --> 00:22:29,165
No, we didn't go
the same fuckin' way.

71
00:22:29,241 --> 00:22:33,871
We have not seen any
of the stuff that we've seen.

72
00:22:33,946 --> 00:22:37,347
We haven't passed
anything that looks familiar.

73
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:39,646
Whatever our direction is,
it's not south,

74
00:22:39,718 --> 00:22:41,379
and it has not been south.

75
00:22:41,454 --> 00:22:44,014
We veered off
at a different point,

76
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:46,024
and when
we started to come back,

77
00:22:46,092 --> 00:22:48,526
to go back, we started
back the exact same way.

78
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,698
But we didn't see anything
that looked the same.

79
00:22:56,769 --> 00:22:59,966
We could have just
bailed early, you know.

80
00:23:00,039 --> 00:23:02,405
There were so many gerrys
along the way.

81
00:23:02,475 --> 00:23:04,773
We took a...
[Inhales sharply]

82
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,650
I mean, we started
going back the same way,

83
00:23:13,719 --> 00:23:15,744
and then we stopped
and said it didn't look right,

84
00:23:15,821 --> 00:23:18,153
and then we went to the right
for a little while.

85
00:23:18,224 --> 00:23:21,284
So we were going east, all
right, which is a total gerry

86
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,989
because that's fucking
a million miles to a road.

87
00:23:25,064 --> 00:23:26,827
That's because we came up
over the thing,

88
00:23:26,899 --> 00:23:29,459
and we saw that whole layout.

89
00:23:29,535 --> 00:23:32,026
There was nothing there.
We didn't see anything.

90
00:23:32,104 --> 00:23:34,231
And then in the morning...

91
00:23:45,284 --> 00:23:47,184
In the morning, we walked north.

92
00:23:47,253 --> 00:23:49,778
In the morning, we...
[Sighs]

93
00:23:49,855 --> 00:23:51,755
In the morning,
we definitely walked north.

94
00:23:51,824 --> 00:23:54,156
And then we gerried off
to the animal tracks,

95
00:23:54,226 --> 00:23:55,284
which was east...

96
00:23:55,361 --> 00:23:58,262
which was west,
but it doesn't matter...

97
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:00,389
When we hit the tracks,
we took a left,

98
00:24:00,466 --> 00:24:02,366
which was going...

99
00:24:10,109 --> 00:24:11,440
...which was going west.

100
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:14,479
But more importantly, when I
got up, when we split up,

101
00:24:14,547 --> 00:24:16,879
and I was walking up
on my scout-about,

102
00:24:16,949 --> 00:24:21,010
I was looking into the sun,
which means that it was east.

103
00:24:21,086 --> 00:24:22,644
Um...

104
00:24:22,721 --> 00:24:25,622
So, and then,
when I was on the rock,

105
00:24:25,691 --> 00:24:28,319
and I was looking at you,
the sun was...

106
00:24:28,394 --> 00:24:30,419
When we came down,
we went in that direction.

107
00:24:30,496 --> 00:24:33,124
That means we were going east,
and we walked for a long time.

108
00:24:33,199 --> 00:24:36,168
And our scout-about was east,
so we gerried the scout-about.

109
00:24:36,235 --> 00:24:37,998
We went up
the wrong fuckin' mountain.

110
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:40,538
Okay?

111
00:24:40,606 --> 00:24:42,836
So our direction's
been north-northeast,

112
00:24:42,908 --> 00:24:44,535
but if we spin the fucker

113
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:47,773
and just go north,
balls-out north,

114
00:24:47,846 --> 00:24:49,973
we're gonna hit
the fuckin' highway

115
00:24:50,049 --> 00:24:51,812
because we can't go south.

116
00:24:51,884 --> 00:24:54,216
South is a fucking
disaster for us.

117
00:24:54,286 --> 00:24:57,187
It would take too fucking long
to get there.

118
00:24:57,256 --> 00:24:59,622
All right, then let's go north.

119
00:33:55,894 --> 00:33:57,486
[Exhales deeply]

120
00:33:58,797 --> 00:34:00,731
Come on, let's go.

121
00:34:01,933 --> 00:34:04,197
We may as well just sit here.

122
00:34:16,581 --> 00:34:18,947
You know why
I think we should go?

123
00:34:26,658 --> 00:34:28,285
Why?

124
00:34:32,364 --> 00:34:34,457
Because I've got water.

125
00:34:40,772 --> 00:34:43,605
Come on, don't fuckin' joke.

126
00:34:44,476 --> 00:34:46,341
I'm not joking.

127
00:34:47,813 --> 00:34:49,747
I found water.

128
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:54,580
I know exactly where the car is.

129

[Sobbing]

130
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,390
How?

131
00:35:15,574 --> 00:35:17,974
Just figured it out.

132
00:35:22,414 --> 00:35:25,383
It was another fuckin' mirage.

133
00:36:06,558 --> 00:36:08,321
It was a mirage.

134
00:36:14,866 --> 00:36:16,663
What are you doing?

135
00:36:24,576 --> 00:36:27,739
I really wanted to...

136
00:36:27,812 --> 00:36:30,804
walk up to you and say I had
two bottles of water,

137
00:36:30,882 --> 00:36:33,373
and that I knew
where the car was.

138
00:36:33,451 --> 00:36:35,544
Come on, we gotta go.

139
00:36:48,433 --> 00:36:50,765
- Come on.
- [Groans]

the hike's going so far?
