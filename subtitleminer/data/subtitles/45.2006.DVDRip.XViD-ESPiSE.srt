DWI:
JMsilv

5
00:00:29,514 --> 00:00:32,861
Big Al has a huge cock.

6
00:00:34,153 --> 00:00:36,568
Seriously. I'm not kidding.

7
00:00:36,569 --> 00:00:39,572
It's giant.

8
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:43,589
It seems it has arms and
legs. What is life itself.

9
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:46,320
As a baby I could bring
shoulder to burp, get it?

10
00:00:46,321 --> 00:00:49,068
It looks like a tool
plumber. The first time I saw ...

11
00:00:49,069 --> 00:00:50,217
said: "Keep that thing.

12
00:00:50,218 --> 00:00:52,471
You will not get close
me with this monster. "

13
00:00:52,472 --> 00:00:54,991
But you know Big Al

14
00:00:55,487 --> 00:00:57,948
He was coming
holla at me.

15
00:00:57,949 --> 00:01:00,914
He looked at me and said:

16
00:01:00,915 --> 00:01:05,176
Think you can?

17
00:01:05,177 --> 00:01:07,579
Think you can?

18
00:01:07,849 --> 00:01:10,160
I mean ...

19
00:01:11,744 --> 00:01:13,826
It was like ...

20
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,410
I'm competitive, you know?

21
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:20,568
I did gymnastics
competitive in high school.

22
00:01:20,569 --> 00:01:24,670
So I took another look.

23
00:01:25,024 --> 00:01:30,586
And I thought, I can
lots of fun trying.

24
00:01:30,587 --> 00:01:32,589
You know?

25
00:01:32,788 --> 00:01:35,684
I have to say
clamber tasty.

26
00:01:35,685 --> 00:01:38,851
I'm talking about climbing
tied to the bedpost ...

27
00:01:38,852 --> 00:01:41,709
with sweaty dirty socks, you know?

28
00:01:41,858 --> 00:01:44,960
You know. Big Al

29
00:01:45,115 --> 00:01:47,997
The king of the hill.

30
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:53,047
You can say what you want
him, but he climbs and cavies.

31
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,325
So.

32
00:03:32,326 --> 00:03:34,378
Sing it.

33
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:36,775
I have some ...

34
00:03:36,777 --> 00:03:40,574
new toasters at home.

35
00:03:40,575 --> 00:03:42,377
I want to.

36
00:03:42,378 --> 00:03:45,044
- Where's Reilly?
- Not seen.

37
00:03:50,744 --> 00:03:53,065
Watch it, baby.

38
00:04:00,726 --> 00:04:02,432
Hey, baby.

39
00:04:06,088 --> 00:04:09,144
- Hey, Muggles.
- Where is he?

40
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:12,824
Ali

41
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,922
Boxy.

42
00:04:17,401 --> 00:04:22,133
- I said I did not want that type.
- You said you wanted customers.

43
00:04:22,134 --> 00:04:25,054
Do not worry. He
is clean. Checked-in.

44
00:04:26,365 --> 00:04:28,280
Will make money for us.

45
00:04:32,804 --> 00:04:34,971
Wait here, okay?

46
00:04:45,091 --> 00:04:47,046
How are you?

47
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,593
Okay.

48
00:04:49,594 --> 00:04:51,746
Where are you from?

49
00:04:51,747 --> 00:04:53,956
- Long Island.
- Really?

50
00:04:53,991 --> 00:04:56,105
What can I do for you?

51
00:04:56,106 --> 00:04:58,520
I want a gun.

52
00:05:00,251 --> 00:05:01,756
Are you stupid?

53
00:05:01,757 --> 00:05:05,923
Could you speak louder? Whether
broadcast in radio news?

54
00:05:05,924 --> 00:05:08,055
- Sorry.
- Got it?

55
00:05:09,582 --> 00:05:11,665
Where on Long Island?

56
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:13,975
Ice Peak.

57
00:05:14,633 --> 00:05:17,668
- Earth Rangers.
- What?

58
00:05:17,669 --> 00:05:21,736
Earth Rangers.
Are you retarded?

59
00:05:21,737 --> 00:05:23,800
Rangers.

60
00:05:25,988 --> 00:05:27,564
- Rangers.
- Yes.

61
00:05:31,273 --> 00:05:33,739
This is an interview?

62
00:05:33,744 --> 00:05:36,495
I just want my 45.

63
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:39,047
Stop!

64
00:05:39,048 --> 00:05:41,365
Liar!

65
00:05:41,816 --> 00:05:45,349
- Enough!
- Go fuck yourself!

66
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:47,564
- What is it?
- It's clean.

67
00:05:47,565 --> 00:05:49,220
You do not have guns.

68
00:05:49,221 --> 00:05:51,368
You came too soon.

69
00:05:51,369 --> 00:05:52,894
That's right.

70
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:55,694
- You knew what you had to do.
- And did what I had!

71
00:05:58,011 --> 00:06:00,812
You have it here?

72
00:06:00,813 --> 00:06:03,806
Hands off my
dick and get the hell out of here.

73
00:06:03,807 --> 00:06:06,600
Or process you for harassment.

74
00:06:06,602 --> 00:06:09,963
Bunch of fags
like the Village People.

75
00:06:09,964 --> 00:06:11,743
Get the hell out of my bar.

76
00:06:11,744 --> 00:06:14,796
- Bitch!
- I'll get you!

77
00:06:14,797 --> 00:06:16,790
We'll get you!

78
00:06:18,406 --> 00:06:20,527
Kiss my dick, your
fucking asshole!

79
00:06:20,528 --> 00:06:23,172
Pull the car from my bar!

80
00:06:23,173 --> 00:06:25,169
Goodbye.

81
00:06:27,503 --> 00:06:29,813
You're hot, B.

82
00:06:29,814 --> 00:06:31,864
- Yeah?
- Sexy.

83
00:06:31,865 --> 00:06:34,886
Let's Get Away
resolve an issue.

84
00:06:38,634 --> 00:06:40,719
Big Al

85
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,533
It was always a troublemaker.

86
00:06:42,534 --> 00:06:44,223
Since he was born.

87
00:06:44,224 --> 00:06:47,113
Son of a bitch! How?

88
00:06:47,114 --> 00:06:50,484
- What have I done?
- I thought I had checked it!

89
00:06:50,485 --> 00:06:54,187
- We checked yes.
- And so they weave for me?

90
00:06:54,188 --> 00:06:58,993
Cesarean section. 48 hours of delivery.

91
00:06:58,994 --> 00:07:03,262
Fucking kid!
Never won anything!

92
00:07:03,263 --> 00:07:05,128
Should have aborted.

93
00:07:05,129 --> 00:07:07,922
Can not manage a
organization as well, ok?

94
00:07:07,923 --> 00:07:09,744
It is a slouch.
Thing amateur.

95
00:07:09,745 --> 00:07:12,268
You have to time it right.

96
00:07:12,269 --> 00:07:14,736
I do not know what you mean.

97
00:07:14,737 --> 00:07:17,579
He never spends the holidays in
home. It's Thanksgiving holiday.

98
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:20,324
But you will not find it here.

99
00:07:20,636 --> 00:07:25,188
Neither knows what is
or family loyalty.

100
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,737
I do not know what went wrong with it.

101
00:07:32,133 --> 00:07:36,329
Not smoked or drank in my
pregnancy. No drop.

102
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,947
Only beer and wine, but
it's no problem.

103
00:07:38,948 --> 00:07:41,663
I'm tired of it, God!

104
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:44,571
What are you doing?

105
00:07:44,572 --> 00:07:46,498
Go to fucking hell!

106
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:50,787
You go. You promised you
would take me from this neighborhood!

107
00:07:50,788 --> 00:07:51,700
Right?

108
00:07:51,701 --> 00:07:55,910
Seaside Heights, Rockway, Ocean
City, etc.. You're treading on the ball.

109
00:07:55,911 --> 00:07:57,690
Go fuck yourself!

110
00:07:57,793 --> 00:07:59,616
I want to see the real world.

111
00:07:59,617 --> 00:08:01,457
- The real world.
- I'm tired of this shit!

112
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:05,690
What a fucking real world?
You got the whole world right here!

113
00:08:07,449 --> 00:08:11,725
Fuck Jesus!

114
00:08:14,965 --> 00:08:18,906
Come here, assholes!
Dinner's ready!

115
00:08:29,155 --> 00:08:32,522
Sorry, but I hate
Thanksgiving.

116
00:08:34,673 --> 00:08:38,964
I did not create a killer
but the streets did.

117
00:08:40,794 --> 00:08:43,241
Stop.

118
00:09:05,332 --> 00:09:07,279
My TV!

119
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,874
Fucking thief!

120
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,822
This does not!

121
00:09:16,414 --> 00:09:18,670
Our new TV!

122
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:23,047
Son of a bitch!

123
00:09:23,048 --> 00:09:24,124
He fainted.

124
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:26,921
Fuck. Look what
he did with the TV!

125
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,410
Had to
do that, sir?

126
00:09:29,411 --> 00:09:31,005
- Sorry.
- Shit!

127
00:09:31,108 --> 00:09:33,474
Call the police, go!

128
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:40,029
Why the hype.
I was just trying to steal.

129
00:09:41,825 --> 00:09:43,531
Do not believe you!

130
00:09:43,532 --> 00:09:46,579
49 West Street, 527. It is a
emergency. You have a thief in the house.

131
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:49,648
Outta the carpet!

132
00:09:49,649 --> 00:09:52,867
It is an original Persian. It's expensive!

133
00:09:52,868 --> 00:09:55,239
Sorry. I made a mistake.

134
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,365
Never come back. Sorry.

135
00:09:57,366 --> 00:10:00,827
Get out of my fucking carpet!

136
00:10:00,828 --> 00:10:04,327
Please do not kill me.
Sorry, please.

137
00:10:04,328 --> 00:10:06,108
Sorry.

138
00:10:06,109 --> 00:10:08,377
No wonder that
not passed by the window.

139
00:10:08,378 --> 00:10:11,062
Look at the size of your ass!

140
00:10:11,063 --> 00:10:14,213
This shit seems
a parking lot.

141
00:10:14,249 --> 00:10:17,990
It has to start making Cooper
asshole!

142
00:10:17,991 --> 00:10:19,728
Please!

143
00:10:19,729 --> 00:10:21,026
I hope you
RG naturalized.

144
00:10:21,027 --> 00:10:22,273
Please let me go.

145
00:10:22,274 --> 00:10:24,571
You are from the Punjab or
is there wherever you go.

146
00:10:24,572 --> 00:10:25,937
Sorry!

147
00:10:25,938 --> 00:10:28,497
You disgust me, you know?

148
00:10:28,498 --> 00:10:32,150
- Sorry to have broken the TV.
- Your fucking, you come here,

149
00:10:32,151 --> 00:10:37,893
They take our jobs and then ...
You are parasites. Make me sick.

150
00:10:37,894 --> 00:10:39,565
What's happening
with that country?

151
00:10:39,566 --> 00:10:44,882
What's happening
with the fucking parents?

152
00:10:44,883 --> 00:10:47,685
Come back to there.

153
00:10:47,686 --> 00:10:49,928
It's the people who
being stolen.

154
00:10:49,929 --> 00:10:53,171
Sorry, please
let me go!

155
00:10:53,274 --> 00:10:55,977
I have a family on the bus.

156
00:10:55,978 --> 00:10:58,263
Bus? You have a
bus down there?

157
00:10:58,264 --> 00:11:01,610
You broke the TV,
I'll take the bus.

158
00:11:01,611 --> 00:11:04,567
Ok? Number 6, 9 ...

159
00:11:04,569 --> 00:11:06,652
I do not wrap.

160
00:11:06,653 --> 00:11:08,972
I was lying.

161
00:11:08,973 --> 00:11:11,600
This shit is mine.

162
00:11:11,601 --> 00:11:14,285
- Do not put your hand!
- I'm not a coach.

163
00:11:14,286 --> 00:11:16,615
But please, let me go!

164
00:11:16,979 --> 00:11:21,703
Al, I have two toasters.

165
00:11:21,704 --> 00:11:24,423
And the blue uniform of the navy.

166
00:11:24,424 --> 00:11:27,192
42 normal for my nephew
is coming to town.

167
00:11:27,193 --> 00:11:30,268
- And three packets of menthol.
- Right.

168
00:11:30,453 --> 00:11:33,252
- Al
- Yes.

169
00:11:33,253 --> 00:11:35,912
Not my fault. Vim
pro wrong address.

170
00:11:35,913 --> 00:11:39,473
- What happened here?
- I caught him trying to rob me.

171
00:11:42,753 --> 00:11:46,254
Lady, please. This
crazy trying to kill me.

172
00:11:46,255 --> 00:11:48,982
What are you doing?
Stop! It was not your home!

173
00:11:48,983 --> 00:11:51,414
- Whether these to his nephew?
- Yes, they are legal.

174
00:11:51,415 --> 00:11:54,266
- On the house, okay?
- Cool.

175
00:11:54,267 --> 00:11:56,976
So ...

176
00:11:57,011 --> 00:11:59,892
- Cash or charge?
- Money.

177
00:11:59,893 --> 00:12:03,452
Unless you have a
those cards "cold."

178
00:12:03,487 --> 00:12:08,147
Maybe. But it has
to give a kiss.

179
00:12:08,807 --> 00:12:11,517
Fuck you!

180
00:12:11,518 --> 00:12:16,656
His problems began with
my husband and I separated.

181
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:19,965
He was a wino
Scottish fucking!

182
00:12:19,966 --> 00:12:22,348
It took Al to
to Scotland, you know?

183
00:12:22,349 --> 00:12:26,159
And when Al came back, he
was more tough and mean.

184
00:12:26,366 --> 00:12:29,266
And also never
lost the accent.

185
00:12:34,575 --> 00:12:36,683
Move to the right.

186
00:12:38,487 --> 00:12:41,903
Ai is left.

187
00:12:48,695 --> 00:12:50,083
What the hell is going on?

188
00:12:50,084 --> 00:12:52,434
Hold it. He
is in the bathroom.

189
00:12:52,435 --> 00:12:54,582
- Who?
- The thief!

190
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:56,618
What the hell are you doing?

191
00:12:58,671 --> 00:13:00,417
What the fuck?

192
00:13:00,418 --> 00:13:03,385
- Is that funny?
- You are a joke?

193
00:13:03,386 --> 00:13:06,137
- Should I call the police again?
- No joke, ok?

194
00:13:06,138 --> 00:13:08,115
I found a criminal
of truth for you!

195
00:13:08,116 --> 00:13:10,758
I'm fed up with the
do your work, ok?

196
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:13,769
He's on the fucking
bathroom. Open the door!

197
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:16,791
Police! Glad you are
here, please help me!

198
00:13:16,792 --> 00:13:19,900
This guy has weapons
throughout the house!

199
00:13:19,901 --> 00:13:22,630
This guy is a comedian.

200
00:13:22,733 --> 00:13:26,708
Your shitty comedian.
They have no warrant.

201
00:13:26,709 --> 00:13:30,579
Why not read the
U.S. Constitution.

202
00:13:32,082 --> 00:13:34,116
And you, hey.

203
00:13:34,117 --> 00:13:37,045
Come, take this asshole
outta my house

204
00:13:37,046 --> 00:13:40,046
before I tell your supervisor
they are harassing me.

205
00:13:40,047 --> 00:13:43,050
Big Al fuck.
I'm not afraid of him.

206
00:13:43,051 --> 00:13:45,432
I'm not afraid of that asshole.

207
00:13:45,433 --> 00:13:47,530
As his ass
right here, man.

208
00:13:47,531 --> 00:13:49,175
Fuck him. Never liked him.

209
00:13:49,176 --> 00:13:51,195
He never liked that
Puerto Rican here.

210
00:13:51,196 --> 00:13:53,728
Let it be so. If
I did this to him?

211
00:13:53,729 --> 00:13:57,778
Of course not. He is walking in flip-flops,
My business is big fish.

212
00:13:57,779 --> 00:13:59,535
Fuck him!

213
00:14:02,233 --> 00:14:03,428
Asshole!

214
00:14:03,429 --> 00:14:06,746
And what about
my needs?

215
00:14:06,782 --> 00:14:08,667
- What?
- Yes, my needs.

216
00:14:08,668 --> 00:14:10,707
I suck.

217
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:13,192
- I suck you good.
- Call it sucking?

218
00:14:13,193 --> 00:14:15,548
I call it
the appetizer.

219
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:18,449
Blowjob of lightning. Right?

220
00:14:18,451 --> 00:14:22,391
Mosquito has sucked me better.
Even stink best ever sucked.

221
00:14:22,392 --> 00:14:25,821
What business is it of selling
a gun without telling me?

222
00:14:26,028 --> 00:14:29,316
- What are you talking about?
- Ok

223
00:14:29,317 --> 00:14:32,794
So think
I do not know about this shit?

224
00:14:32,795 --> 00:14:33,741
Clancy said.

225
00:14:33,742 --> 00:14:36,579
Why are you doing
business on my back?

226
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:39,254
He needed a weapon.
What should I do?

227
00:14:39,255 --> 00:14:41,115
Spoil the deal?
Your money is there.

228
00:14:41,116 --> 00:14:43,233
- How much?
- Same as always.

229
00:14:44,268 --> 00:14:47,876
$ 400 in the drawer
his underwear, okay?

230
00:14:47,877 --> 00:14:48,988
Near the swineherd.

231
00:14:48,989 --> 00:14:52,393
- You are trying to wrap myself?
- Enough, for God's sake.

232
00:14:52,394 --> 00:14:55,996
You're giving pro Clancy.
He is a son of a bitch.

233
00:14:55,997 --> 00:14:58,960
- I understand how he looks?
- Knock it off. I sleep with a guy.

234
00:14:58,961 --> 00:15:00,190
Stop talking shit.

235
00:15:00,192 --> 00:15:03,634
First, I hear they're selling
arms behind my back.

236
00:15:03,635 --> 00:15:06,284
Oh, I get home
and you do not tell me.

237
00:15:06,285 --> 00:15:08,477
- Then ask to suck my dick ...
- Shut up!

238
00:15:08,478 --> 00:15:11,502
- And you do not suck.
- Shut up!

239
00:15:12,515 --> 00:15:15,073
Who told you?

240
00:15:15,176 --> 00:15:16,978
Hellen.

241
00:15:16,979 --> 00:15:18,580
Son of a bitch!

242
00:15:19,816 --> 00:15:21,784
Son of a bitch.

243
00:15:21,785 --> 00:15:24,320
These men fucking.

244
00:15:24,321 --> 00:15:25,864
Big Al thinks the worst thing

245
00:15:25,866 --> 00:15:27,688
can do is
sleeping with another guy.

246
00:15:27,689 --> 00:15:30,116
Leave the other guy to eat you.

247
00:15:30,117 --> 00:15:33,507
But he could
eat other, right?

248
00:15:33,508 --> 00:15:35,242
He made it all the time.

249
00:15:35,243 --> 00:15:38,678
Pras women one thing,
to other men.

250
00:15:38,713 --> 00:15:41,368
Favoring it.

251
00:15:41,369 --> 00:15:43,477
This business does not stick with me.

252
00:15:43,478 --> 00:15:45,384
I do not understand.

253
00:15:45,385 --> 00:15:48,331
I do not know why guys think
who are overcoming a relationship.

254
00:15:48,332 --> 00:15:51,954
They think they're
"Eating us."

255
00:15:52,965 --> 00:15:54,744
When I sleep with a guy.

256
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:57,875
I guarantee that he knows
Who is eating whom.

257
00:15:57,876 --> 00:16:01,702
And shove my finger in his
ass just so he knows it.

258
00:16:01,703 --> 00:16:06,087
It did not pass my 45
by mistake, right?

259
00:16:06,088 --> 00:16:08,273
- What?
- The 45.

260
00:16:08,274 --> 00:16:12,498
No. I'm not stupid. Was another.

261
00:16:15,255 --> 00:16:18,533
That is recorded
in my name, ok?

262
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:21,062
Suck their fingers.

263
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,934
- I'm getting horny.
- I know.

264
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:30,588
Right? Do not touch the 45, okay?

265
00:16:32,046 --> 00:16:35,634
Want to know Al? He is very
good at getting things.

266
00:16:35,635 --> 00:16:38,415
Cars, jewelry, clothes.

267
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:43,286
Women. But he
do not know look after them.

268
00:16:44,034 --> 00:16:46,530
I was his property.

269
00:16:46,531 --> 00:16:50,775
You can find me crazy, but I
wanted something more than that, okay?

270
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:53,500
Oh, and nobody broke
most want to go out,

271
00:16:53,501 --> 00:16:54,862
all the guys are afraid.

272
00:16:54,909 --> 00:16:57,775
I have to go out with guys
New Jersey. Horrible.

273
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:05,354
What?

274
00:17:05,355 --> 00:17:09,681
- It's Vic.
- It had to be that same bitch.

275
00:17:09,683 --> 00:17:12,284
Shut up, she's my friend.
One second!

276
00:17:12,285 --> 00:17:14,663
Do not stand her.
She always ruins everything.

277
00:17:14,664 --> 00:17:16,581
Shut up!

278
00:17:20,482 --> 00:17:24,297
- She is bisexual, ok?
- So what? Still a dyke.

279
00:17:24,298 --> 00:17:26,870
You have to remember
his affair with her?

280
00:17:26,872 --> 00:17:30,086
Once was.
Large to be boring.

281
00:17:32,188 --> 00:17:34,541
A second, sweetie.

282
00:17:34,542 --> 00:17:36,200
- Hi
- Hi, sweetheart.

283
00:17:36,201 --> 00:17:39,049
- How are you, lindona.
- Fine.

284
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,561
Nothing lesbianism
in front of me.

285
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,739
- Unless I'm in the middle.
- Not Call him.

286
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:47,421
Okay, I do not
fucked slimy.

287
00:17:47,422 --> 00:17:49,104
How are you?

288
00:17:49,105 --> 00:17:51,863
You look great.

289
00:17:51,864 --> 00:17:54,253
Your hair is awesome!

290
00:17:54,254 --> 00:17:56,263
Like it?
Do you think her hair is great?

291
00:17:56,264 --> 00:17:59,018
Looks like she got
with a spanner.

292
00:17:59,019 --> 00:18:01,619
- Shut up.
- Nice to see you too, man.

293
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:04,416
- Sit down. Want a drink?
- Yes.

294
00:18:07,499 --> 00:18:10,342
She lives with me now,
dyke, okay?

295
00:18:11,986 --> 00:18:15,728
Looks like it.
Since I knocked on the door

296
00:18:15,729 --> 00:18:17,868
and she answered, etc..

297
00:18:17,869 --> 00:18:20,362
Al, still confused?

298
00:18:20,363 --> 00:18:22,231
- What?
- Are you still drunk?

299
00:18:22,232 --> 00:18:24,641
- Go home, you can.
- It's so obvious?

300
00:18:24,642 --> 00:18:27,699
- You fucking wino!
- Come on, boner.

301
00:18:29,249 --> 00:18:32,705
Son of a bitch!

302
00:18:33,769 --> 00:18:36,662
My God! Al, stop it!

303
00:18:36,663 --> 00:18:39,795
- Jesus Christ!
- You are a moron.

304
00:18:39,797 --> 00:18:43,745
You are living proof that
We should all be lesbians.

305
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:46,157
Yes, I think
just a turn.

306
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:48,290
- So, your hair looks amazing.
- Thanks.

307
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:49,385
Really cool.

308
00:18:49,386 --> 00:18:51,917
- And I've been working out very well.
- Yeah?

309
00:18:51,918 --> 00:18:55,318
I won in 5cm
2 arms and chest.

310
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:55,945
Legal.

311
00:18:55,946 --> 00:18:58,168
I have to have shoulders
wide to beat the Al

312
00:18:58,169 --> 00:19:00,394
Since I met Al,
wanted him to die.

313
00:19:00,395 --> 00:19:03,224
I hated his masculinity.

314
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,806
His essence.

315
00:19:04,807 --> 00:19:07,904
It was not your fault
he could not escape it.

316
00:19:07,905 --> 00:19:11,165
He was so. Product
of his horrible childhood.

317
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:12,651
But ...

318
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,920
Give a kiss.

319
00:19:20,381 --> 00:19:23,104
See what is missing?

320
00:19:24,274 --> 00:19:26,355
Even more.

321
00:19:26,356 --> 00:19:30,878
No tongue kiss
while I'm away, girls.

322
00:19:31,964 --> 00:19:35,730
I enjoyed it there within five minutes.

323
00:19:35,731 --> 00:19:37,427
Thanks for the warning.

324
00:19:37,428 --> 00:19:39,894
Get out.

325
00:19:47,026 --> 00:19:48,925
Clean bar?

326
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:02,325
- Who is it?
- Jose Vargas.

327
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,074
What?

328
00:20:05,626 --> 00:20:09,551
We should say that
not sold to Jose.

329
00:20:09,552 --> 00:20:12,647
He would kill me if she knew
sold to a Puerto Rican.

330
00:20:12,648 --> 00:20:14,160
As long as he does not think ...

331
00:20:14,161 --> 00:20:16,507
sold to a Puerto Rican,
we're good at.

332
00:20:16,788 --> 00:20:20,290
He's just brute force and
I the girl with the plans.

333
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:22,600
I am a businesswoman, I have
any big plans.

334
00:20:22,601 --> 00:20:25,216
- You have big plans?
- Yes.

335
00:20:25,217 --> 00:20:28,393
- You know.
- I hope I'm included.

336
00:20:32,636 --> 00:20:34,808
You know you are.

337
00:20:39,548 --> 00:20:42,812
If he hurt you again,
I kill it.

338
00:20:42,813 --> 00:20:44,782
I promise.

339
00:20:47,185 --> 00:20:50,320
My daughter Kat.

340
00:20:50,321 --> 00:20:54,586
The danger always attracted her.
Even when I was a little girl.

341
00:20:55,507 --> 00:20:57,930
She was always
doing what could not.

342
00:20:57,931 --> 00:21:00,518
Ordered her not to do,
and she did it anyway.

343
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:03,123
"Do not drink." and she drank.
"Do not do drugs." and she wore.

344
00:21:03,124 --> 00:21:06,640
"Beware of the boys."
Forget it.

345
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:09,997
She always challenged.

346
00:21:09,998 --> 00:21:12,120
Always wanted too.

347
00:21:12,121 --> 00:21:14,748
Never wanted to be normal.
She had to be special.

348
00:21:14,749 --> 00:21:16,760
And look what happened.

349
00:21:16,761 --> 00:21:19,712
I'm not surprised.

350
00:21:20,728 --> 00:21:23,883
She was always beautiful and
Proud of your hair.

351
00:21:23,885 --> 00:21:25,253
And she inherited it from me.

352
00:21:25,254 --> 00:21:29,980
You get more ass
that toilet.

353
00:21:29,981 --> 00:21:32,311
I'm talking about
Quality Ass.

354
00:21:32,312 --> 00:21:33,305
Quality fuck.

355
00:21:33,306 --> 00:21:35,382
What matters is what
is in the middle of the legs.

356
00:21:35,383 --> 00:21:38,701
- You have to Kat.
- Okay, man.

357
00:21:38,702 --> 00:21:41,229
You can not have everything, right?

358
00:21:41,938 --> 00:21:44,893
I think I'll go back to Dell.

359
00:21:44,894 --> 00:21:48,320
Let this woman go.
She's a bitch.

360
00:21:48,321 --> 00:21:52,912
She gave my ass so many times that he
looks like a scientific experiment.

361
00:21:52,913 --> 00:21:55,780
So what? It excites me.

362
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:58,867
If it excites you. You're the man
that more lives full of lust.

363
00:21:58,868 --> 00:22:01,118
You would do anything
by a pussy.

364
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:04,358
I decided to change his life.

365
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:07,628
- What?
- I'm going back to Catholic again.

366
00:22:07,629 --> 00:22:10,198
- I'll give up everything.
- Dude.

367
00:22:10,199 --> 00:22:14,003
I am tired of hearing
this litany. I've heard this before.

368
00:22:14,004 --> 00:22:17,205
Enough. I want a normal life.

369
00:22:17,207 --> 00:22:19,875
A life and a normal job.

370
00:22:21,143 --> 00:22:23,354
- What do we do?
- Nothing much.

371
00:22:23,355 --> 00:22:24,219
Nothing illegal, ok?

372
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:27,139
I've said that from this
tomorrow my life is another.

373
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:31,140
You have to change
completely.

374
00:22:31,488 --> 00:22:32,994
You know ...

375
00:22:33,134 --> 00:22:35,218
Always have a place for you

376
00:22:35,219 --> 00:22:37,311
in my organization.

377
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:40,121
You'll be mine
right arm again.

378
00:22:40,122 --> 00:22:43,789
Do not you hear me, man?
What the fuck are you talking about?

379
00:22:43,824 --> 00:22:45,361
Never been his right arm.

380
00:22:45,362 --> 00:22:49,709
I was independent. Did
my own work.

381
00:22:49,744 --> 00:22:51,807
Never worked for you, Al!

382
00:22:51,808 --> 00:22:54,917
You need me, man!

383
00:22:54,953 --> 00:22:57,043
Bullshit.

384
00:22:57,147 --> 00:22:59,327
The only thing
need you

385
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:01,766
is a woman like Kat.
It's what I need.

386
00:23:01,767 --> 00:23:04,159
What the fuck is this obsession?

387
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,692
It is not obsession.

388
00:23:07,212 --> 00:23:09,978
It's a great girl.
Just that.

389
00:23:09,979 --> 00:23:12,365
Slope there.

390
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:22,007
- What's happening?
- I'll steal that car.

391
00:23:22,857 --> 00:23:25,648
It's the car that stole
last week.

392
00:23:25,649 --> 00:23:28,596
Yeah, right.
And now I have to return.

393
00:23:28,597 --> 00:23:29,904
The guy who stole a paid

394
00:23:29,905 --> 00:23:31,773
great reward
for his recovery.

395
00:23:31,774 --> 00:23:35,025
I better be
legal and return.

396
00:23:35,026 --> 00:23:36,541
And the guy who sold it to?

397
00:23:36,542 --> 00:23:39,582
Fuck him. He is a foot
scuff normal work.

398
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:42,715
Just like you want to be.
A normal guy.

399
00:23:42,716 --> 00:23:46,247
Normal guys to fuck, Big Al did not.
That's what happens.

400
00:23:46,939 --> 00:23:50,934
You will earn one month
wage in 10 seconds.

401
00:23:50,935 --> 00:23:54,419
Deal or no, Mr. Normal?

402
00:23:56,301 --> 00:23:59,993
It's the last time, Al's over.

403
00:24:00,113 --> 00:24:02,970
Last time.

404
00:24:22,038 --> 00:24:24,724
Al should have left the neighborhood.

405
00:24:25,324 --> 00:24:27,565
Kat wanted it.

406
00:24:28,644 --> 00:24:31,203
The way
things resulted ...

407
00:24:31,204 --> 00:24:33,467
Al should have listened to her.

408
00:24:39,461 --> 00:24:42,022
If I wanted to kill Al?

409
00:24:42,023 --> 00:24:45,314
Yes! Many times.

410
00:24:46,774 --> 00:24:49,996
He had something for
which I kill him?

411
00:24:50,773 --> 00:24:51,969
Yes

412
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:54,698
Hi, ladies.

413
00:24:55,519 --> 00:24:58,673
- Are you the money?
- Right here.

414
00:24:58,674 --> 00:25:00,358
Passes for here!

415
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:02,672
- Why do not you get me?
- Bitch.

416
00:25:02,673 --> 00:25:06,997
Kidding.
Come here, baby.

417
00:25:07,161 --> 00:25:09,350
You know
you would not curl.

418
00:25:09,351 --> 00:25:11,663
Yeah it goes here.

419
00:25:12,182 --> 00:25:15,006
- I like doing business with you.
- Yeah?

420
00:25:15,007 --> 00:25:19,114
The way they always do.
Strip legs of me.

421
00:25:22,347 --> 00:25:24,641
I would do much
more with you, honey.

422
00:25:24,642 --> 00:25:26,478
And who would not?

423
00:25:26,479 --> 00:25:29,476
You need a man
like me, dear, you know?

424
00:25:29,512 --> 00:25:32,932
- I could show you some things.
- Yeah?

425
00:25:32,933 --> 00:25:36,770
My boyfriend, Big Al,
would not like that very much.

426
00:25:36,771 --> 00:25:38,425
I can hit on your boyfriend.

427
00:25:38,426 --> 00:25:41,081
I'm not interested,
Sanches, get out, thanks.

428
00:25:41,082 --> 00:25:43,548
You could get rid of it?

429
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:47,414
It would be easy.
Why is he with?

430
00:25:47,415 --> 00:25:50,326
He is walking in flip-flops.
A lindona like you.

431
00:25:50,327 --> 00:25:52,302
You need to be with
a man who

432
00:25:52,303 --> 00:25:54,390
is reaching
somewhere. Like me.

433
00:25:54,391 --> 00:25:55,318
- Oh yeah?
- Yes.

434
00:25:55,319 --> 00:25:57,895
You are going to jail.

435
00:25:57,896 --> 00:26:00,340
Even more, Chico.

436
00:26:01,773 --> 00:26:04,650
I'll never want to eat
you "or" this attitude.

437
00:26:04,651 --> 00:26:08,754
You can eat attitude,
but I would be more delicious.

438
00:26:08,755 --> 00:26:11,014
Even more.

439
00:26:11,015 --> 00:26:13,212
Juanita, who delights.

440
00:26:13,235 --> 00:26:17,420
I can not express
my gratitude, detective.

441
00:26:17,421 --> 00:26:21,773
It's incredible that neither is a risk
it. Thank you very much.

442
00:26:21,774 --> 00:26:22,934
Sure.

443
00:26:22,935 --> 00:26:24,233
If I can do
something for you ...

444
00:26:24,234 --> 00:26:26,574
Listen. The District
contact you tomorrow.

445
00:26:26,575 --> 00:26:30,100
- Ok
- Ok, thanks. Whatever you need.

446
00:26:31,322 --> 00:26:33,050
Thanks.

447
00:26:35,805 --> 00:26:38,473
Thank you.

448
00:26:39,022 --> 00:26:41,630
Sex with men is like snow.

449
00:26:41,631 --> 00:26:45,148
You never know how many centimeters
will be or how long it will last.

450
00:26:45,732 --> 00:26:49,509
The difference between men and
women is too big for me

451
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:51,438
even begin to understand.

452
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,991
For example, a woman ...

453
00:26:54,215 --> 00:26:58,324
just want to hear three
words of a man, I love you.

454
00:26:58,326 --> 00:27:01,776
A man wants to hear three words
too, but different.

455
00:27:02,351 --> 00:27:05,736
It's so big!

456
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,991
Not?

457
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:09,791
Assholes!

458
00:27:09,964 --> 00:27:13,641
To me, Big Al is the reason that
abortion should be legalized.

459
00:27:13,642 --> 00:27:16,858
You talk about sex more than
any girl I know.

460
00:27:16,859 --> 00:27:19,819
You are the girl more
so fuck I know.

461
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:23,439
- Standing next to you makes me horny.
- Go take the tail.

462
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:26,458
When will drop the Al?

463
00:27:28,006 --> 00:27:31,665
Really? Knock it off, Vic.

464
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:34,282
Knock it off!

465
00:27:34,385 --> 00:27:39,771
We're having fun, right?
Said this at the wrong time.

466
00:27:39,979 --> 00:27:42,333
I'll wait for you.

467
00:27:43,501 --> 00:27:46,413
What do you have in common?!

468
00:27:48,912 --> 00:27:52,266
Weapons. We both love.

469
00:27:52,804 --> 00:27:55,215
The weapons and I are
in love with him.

470
00:27:55,945 --> 00:27:57,874
That is what we have in common.

471
00:27:57,875 --> 00:28:00,061
You're in love with him?

472
00:28:00,164 --> 00:28:03,480
Yes, Vic, I am.

473
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:07,085
- Sorry, but ...
- No, you know what?

474
00:28:08,129 --> 00:28:10,921
Possession is not love.

475
00:28:11,128 --> 00:28:14,795
Alcoholics do not have love,
they have hostages.

476
00:28:14,796 --> 00:28:18,294
And it does not suit you.

477
00:28:19,676 --> 00:28:21,782
I serve.

478
00:28:23,613 --> 00:28:26,664
I may even treat you like
shit if you like.

479
00:28:27,991 --> 00:28:30,562
Thank you. Come on.

480
00:28:40,207 --> 00:28:42,877
- Hey.
- And there, assholes.

481
00:28:43,735 --> 00:28:46,156
At least someone is
earning a living here.

482
00:28:47,737 --> 00:28:49,928
Look Reilly.

483
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:53,624
Ass.

484
00:28:53,863 --> 00:28:55,176
Ass and nice.

485
00:28:55,177 --> 00:28:59,295
So dumb it takes 2 hours
to watch the 60 minutes.

486
00:28:59,744 --> 00:29:03,492
- I'll get this tonight.
- Good luck.

487
00:29:03,493 --> 00:29:06,838
She's a dyke.
She likes to suck pussy.

488
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:09,058
It is a challenge.

489
00:29:09,266 --> 00:29:11,990
I do not eat.

490
00:29:12,797 --> 00:29:15,657
It may not be as
Kat bad if the bears.

491
00:29:15,658 --> 00:29:17,580
What does this mean?

492
00:29:19,911 --> 00:29:21,922
Hi, girls.

493
00:29:27,285 --> 00:29:30,196
- Why are you laughing?
- Let's talk back.

494
00:29:30,197 --> 00:29:33,082
- Reilly, how are you?
- Well

495
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:37,389
What?

496
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:40,195
For God's sake. Are
See what I have to endure?

497
00:29:40,196 --> 00:29:41,278
Come on.

498
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:44,247
I'm going. Easy.

499
00:29:46,671 --> 00:29:49,569
Can I pay a
beer for you, Vic?

500
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:51,486
I do not drink.

501
00:29:52,505 --> 00:29:55,414
I am Irish from birth.

502
00:29:55,415 --> 00:29:57,630
Really? What a coincidence.

503
00:29:57,631 --> 00:29:59,428
Reilly, I'm not ...

504
00:29:59,429 --> 00:30:03,013
I was not born in Ireland,
but my family.

505
00:30:03,014 --> 00:30:06,882
My parents have some shoes
Irish first.

506
00:30:06,883 --> 00:30:09,567
My mom makes the best
buoy Irish town.

507
00:30:09,568 --> 00:30:11,489
She makes those sweaters
tiny little cute too?

508
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:13,148
- Indeed yes.
- Really?

509
00:30:13,149 --> 00:30:17,234
Do so. She must have some
reassembling these sweaters a. ..

510
00:30:17,373 --> 00:30:20,382
the early nineteenth century,
I think.

511
00:30:22,085 --> 00:30:24,533
She knows all the
Irish music.

512
00:30:24,534 --> 00:30:26,146
Danny Boy, etc.. And my father ...

513
00:30:26,249 --> 00:30:29,306
met the guy who invented the
Irish Spring soap.

514
00:30:29,307 --> 00:30:31,197
See?

515
00:30:31,198 --> 00:30:33,973
Everyone in this fucking neighborhood ...

516
00:30:33,974 --> 00:30:35,781
Whipped! You're Irish.

517
00:30:35,782 --> 00:30:39,074
- Relax, eat a potato.
- What?

518
00:30:39,703 --> 00:30:43,402
Sorry.

519
00:30:43,403 --> 00:30:46,004
I'm not feeling
same today. I'm kinda busy.

520
00:30:46,005 --> 00:30:48,138
Do not worry.

521
00:30:48,139 --> 00:30:50,232
What is your nationality?

522
00:30:50,233 --> 00:30:52,341
Jewish.

523
00:30:53,365 --> 00:30:56,340
Jewish? Where is it?

524
00:30:56,375 --> 00:30:58,698
In the Bible.

525
00:30:58,699 --> 00:31:01,368
It must be very old.

526
00:31:01,369 --> 00:31:03,905
Undoubtedly.

527
00:31:05,054 --> 00:31:08,389
- Where are most of the Jews?
- Long Island.

528
00:31:08,424 --> 00:31:10,764
Now we can get out?

529
00:31:17,109 --> 00:31:19,879
I heard you slept
with some women.

530
00:31:20,721 --> 00:31:22,973
What's this?

531
00:31:23,414 --> 00:31:24,983
Nothing.

532
00:31:24,984 --> 00:31:26,953
I also slept.

533
00:31:27,056 --> 00:31:28,770
Really?

534
00:31:28,771 --> 00:31:32,733
Legal, Reilly. Your mother should
be very proud of you.

535
00:31:32,769 --> 00:31:35,138
Now could you please
going home the fucking?

536
00:31:35,139 --> 00:31:36,898
Am I bothering you?

537
00:31:36,899 --> 00:31:40,487
No, I'm always hostile
when you do not like anyone.

538
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:44,688
I love horror movies.
You like?

539
00:31:44,689 --> 00:31:47,068
I like it.

540
00:31:47,786 --> 00:31:50,252
Maybe go watch one, Friday night,
want to come with me?

541
00:31:50,253 --> 00:31:52,865
Jesus, Reilly!
You are a horror movie for me.

542
00:31:52,866 --> 00:31:57,045
If you play, man. I will not be your next
victim. I'm not interested, okay?

543
00:31:57,046 --> 00:32:00,737
- Why not?
- Why not just want me to draw.

544
00:32:00,738 --> 00:32:03,458
- Not true.
- Is not it?

545
00:32:03,494 --> 00:32:05,277
No.

546
00:32:05,485 --> 00:32:09,833
You're so tough, you know?

547
00:32:11,625 --> 00:32:15,686
Right. Contact a good reason
not to give me.

548
00:32:15,687 --> 00:32:17,360
A good reason?

549
00:32:17,361 --> 00:32:19,492
Do not take it personally,
but not like you.

550
00:32:19,493 --> 00:32:21,592
This is not right.

551
00:32:21,593 --> 00:32:23,403
It's an excuse.

552
00:32:23,507 --> 00:32:25,858
- Incredible.
- It's just an excuse.

553
00:32:25,859 --> 00:32:29,158
You do not even want to.

554
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,897
You want to Kat.

555
00:32:31,184 --> 00:32:33,235
But can not have.

556
00:32:34,606 --> 00:32:38,324
- Do you have a problem there.
- What?

557
00:32:39,948 --> 00:32:43,000
- Al
- Al

558
00:32:44,978 --> 00:32:47,522
Why not kill?

559
00:32:50,044 --> 00:32:52,125
Just get rid of it.

560
00:32:52,127 --> 00:32:54,601
Oh, perhaps
it could be yours.

561
00:32:54,704 --> 00:32:59,287
Al is my friend. I do not do this
sort of thing with friends.

562
00:32:59,288 --> 00:33:01,713
It's just a detail.

563
00:33:01,714 --> 00:33:04,562
Come on, Reilly, be courageous.

564
00:33:04,563 --> 00:33:07,279
Try something new.
Kill a friend.

565
00:33:07,731 --> 00:33:09,429
He does not like yourself.

566
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:11,673
Always speaks ill of
you behind your back.

567
00:33:11,674 --> 00:33:13,650
Oh yeah?

568
00:33:13,651 --> 00:33:15,401
Type?

569
00:33:15,402 --> 00:33:17,156
Say.

570
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:21,925
- You're not afraid of him, right?
- No.

571
00:33:22,012 --> 00:33:24,043
Get rid of him then.

572
00:33:24,044 --> 00:33:25,929
He thinks you
is a foot-and-shame.

573
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:29,331
I no longer do things like that.

574
00:33:29,643 --> 00:33:34,468
I am changing.
To follow my religion now.

575
00:33:34,469 --> 00:33:37,341
Following your religion?
How sweet.

576
00:33:37,342 --> 00:33:40,146
It's a bit late for that,
huh?

577
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:47,090
After all this talk, I
to go to the bathroom to vomit.

578
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:48,661
Wait.

579
00:33:48,662 --> 00:33:51,074
What do I do to eat you, eh?

580
00:33:52,622 --> 00:33:54,331
Come on.

581
00:33:55,374 --> 00:33:57,238
I want you.

582
00:33:57,629 --> 00:33:59,606
Right.

583
00:34:00,518 --> 00:34:03,699
I sleep with you under one condition.

584
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:06,859
If you get rid of Al

585
00:34:08,051 --> 00:34:11,797
- You are very demanding.
- You should see me in bed.

586
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:19,184
- You're a good guy, Reilly.
- Thanks.

587
00:34:19,185 --> 00:34:21,520
Think about it.

588
00:34:22,537 --> 00:34:24,306
I'll think.

589
00:34:25,305 --> 00:34:27,758
I'm worth it.

590
00:34:30,727 --> 00:34:33,250
I bet you do.

591
00:34:36,596 --> 00:34:39,315
Now he will turn
a good Catholic boy.

592
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:43,225
- What's happening?
- Nothing.

593
00:34:43,226 --> 00:34:46,727
If you do, I'll take in the face.

594
00:34:46,728 --> 00:34:48,842
Fuck.

595
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:55,128
Hey, Reilly, and then?

596
00:34:56,083 --> 00:34:59,514
- You're beautiful.
- Are you drunk?

597
00:34:59,515 --> 00:35:02,033
I want to kiss you right now.

598
00:35:02,034 --> 00:35:04,416
Is not that drunk skunk.

599
00:35:04,417 --> 00:35:06,448
I always wanted
were my girl.

600
00:35:06,449 --> 00:35:08,571
Reilly! Come here.

601
00:35:08,572 --> 00:35:10,960
I'll be there soon. I'm going.

602
00:35:10,961 --> 00:35:15,339
- Daddy's calling, Reilly.
- If you stay with me shooting this neighborhood

603
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:18,200
You know he will not.

604
00:35:27,519 --> 00:35:31,418
- O'Reilly is a good match.
- Very sexy.

605
00:35:31,419 --> 00:35:34,445
Sexy?
I thought you were in love.

606
00:35:34,446 --> 00:35:38,141
Have dinner request does not stop me
to see what's on the menu.

607
00:35:38,142 --> 00:35:41,869
Do not know if he told you, but I am
one of the special dishes of the night.

608
00:35:43,167 --> 00:35:46,211
Shit! Look who came.

609
00:35:47,028 --> 00:35:50,544
- Fool!
- We talk to never come here.

610
00:35:54,315 --> 00:35:57,414
So?
Want to light my cigarette?

611
00:35:57,415 --> 00:36:00,520
Are you crazy?
What the hell are you doing here?

612
00:36:00,521 --> 00:36:02,601
Give the lighter.

613
00:36:04,582 --> 00:36:07,669
- Why are you so nervous? Hhhh.
- Stay away from me.

614
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:09,799
Al

615
00:36:14,427 --> 00:36:17,262
Jesus Christ.

616
00:36:17,263 --> 00:36:21,709
- See you around.
- Get your hands off me.

617
00:36:24,345 --> 00:36:26,206
The Puerto Rican is
be rude.

618
00:36:26,207 --> 00:36:29,168
Have to put it in place.

619
00:36:29,484 --> 00:36:31,611
Never mess with
nobody's wife.

620
00:36:31,612 --> 00:36:35,013
- Do not move.
- Never mess with mine!

621
00:36:37,785 --> 00:36:41,371
- What?
- Please sit down.

622
00:36:41,372 --> 00:36:46,981
- What have I done?
- Do not be silly, bitch!

623
00:36:48,087 --> 00:36:51,757
- Do not know what I did.
- You know yes.

624
00:36:51,758 --> 00:36:55,970
- No.
- I saw you with the Puerto Rican.

625
00:36:55,971 --> 00:36:59,390
It's about that then
Puerto Rican.

626
00:36:59,391 --> 00:37:03,258
He came to me and asked a
cigarette and I told him to fuck off.

627
00:37:03,259 --> 00:37:06,737
- You touched his arm.
- I touched nothing. What are you talking about?

628
00:37:06,738 --> 00:37:10,459
- Do not lie!
- I touched unintentionally, ok?

629
00:37:10,486 --> 00:37:15,431
- Honey ...
- You're drunk.

630
00:37:15,992 --> 00:37:18,160
Come here.

631
00:37:18,161 --> 00:37:21,562
Get up,
your big baby.

632
00:37:23,166 --> 00:37:26,919
- Go fuck yourself.
- You spoke with him e. ..

633
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:30,381
- Shut up.
- You lit his cigarette e. ..

634
00:37:30,382 --> 00:37:34,135
- Touched his arm ...
- Al, that business ...

635
00:37:34,136 --> 00:37:36,221
Then he tried to touch the chest,
right?

636
00:37:36,222 --> 00:37:39,623
It was not love?

637
00:37:43,229 --> 00:37:48,755
- When I saw him looking at her ...
- Could you stop?!

638
00:37:48,756 --> 00:37:49,935
beautiful legs.

639
00:37:52,614 --> 00:37:55,994
You're like a bitch
night with this dress.

640
00:37:55,995 --> 00:37:58,021
You seem like a bitch, huh?

641
00:37:58,161 --> 00:38:00,580
- You bought this dress.
- I seen my girl.

642
00:38:00,581 --> 00:38:03,958
You said I looked like the
inside him, like Faith Hill.

643
00:38:03,959 --> 00:38:06,711
Want to suck my dick right?

644
00:38:06,712 --> 00:38:11,574
Did you suck
his dick too, right?

645
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:15,387
- Shut up.
- Shut you.

646
00:38:15,388 --> 00:38:17,806
Did you suck
Puerto Rican cock.

647
00:38:17,807 --> 00:38:19,519
- Answer!
- Get off me!

648
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,689
Would you give him,
your white trash.

649
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:27,108
Vic stayed with all night.
The three of you. Bitch bitch.

650
00:38:27,109 --> 00:38:31,654
I saw the way it looked.
You disgust me!

651
00:38:31,655 --> 00:38:36,718
Answer a question, ok?
What did he say to you?

652
00:38:36,786 --> 00:38:40,852
- Nothing! He only asked fire!
- Liar!

653
00:38:42,291 --> 00:38:47,069
Sorry, honey. Come here.

654
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:54,303
Okay. Just could not stand to see.

655
00:38:54,304 --> 00:38:58,349
You embarrass me
in front of my friends.

656
00:38:58,350 --> 00:39:02,228
How will I maintain
their respect?

657
00:39:02,229 --> 00:39:06,900
Reilly said: "Look to your wife
Chat with a Puerto Rican. "

658
00:39:06,901 --> 00:39:10,968
"She wants dick latino." That's
Whatever, fucking whore?

659
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:16,243
Expects me to suck
pussy of Puerto Rican?

660
00:39:16,244 --> 00:39:21,691
Want me to eat pussy
Puerto Rican? Bitch!

661
00:39:23,502 --> 00:39:26,545
How can a
these slutty!

662
00:39:26,547 --> 00:39:30,383
I told his son
motherfucker! I did nothing.

663
00:39:30,384 --> 00:39:33,850
- I was going to fuck it, bitch.
- Stop!

664
00:39:33,887 --> 00:39:37,754
Bitch sucker of Latin!
Stay down!

665
00:39:37,791 --> 00:39:41,228
- Do not move!
- No! Please.

666
00:39:41,229 --> 00:39:46,209
- Stop, please!
- Come here. Cut your face.

667
00:39:46,484 --> 00:39:50,279
- Retail that face.
- Stop!

668
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,055
- Do not move.
- Let me.

669
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:57,501
I will leave you so ugly
nobody will look.

670
00:39:57,538 --> 00:40:02,733
Please, Al

671
00:40:08,424 --> 00:40:12,014
Honey.

672
00:40:14,097 --> 00:40:19,504
- He touched his hand.
- He said he liked my hair.

673
00:40:19,519 --> 00:40:23,077
- He said he liked my hair.
- See? You lied.

674
00:40:23,114 --> 00:40:26,818
You lie, you see?
Hiding things from me.

675
00:40:26,819 --> 00:40:28,640
- You understand?
- No, please.

676
00:40:28,641 --> 00:40:31,042
Why not say so before?

677
00:40:31,078 --> 00:40:35,893
- I do not know.
- Come here, baby.

678
00:40:36,621 --> 00:40:39,873
- I never want to see you so.
- Please!

679
00:40:39,874 --> 00:40:42,298
- Listen.
- Please, Al!

680
00:40:42,335 --> 00:40:45,676
I never want to see
you dressed like that.

681
00:40:47,632 --> 00:40:53,573
It looks like a slut in that dress.
Tire.

682
00:40:54,264 --> 00:40:56,849
- Please.
- Remove.

683
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:58,783
Give it here.

684
00:41:05,067 --> 00:41:08,612
Take this shit, ok?

685
00:41:08,613 --> 00:41:11,740
Ok, let's go to the room.

686
00:41:11,741 --> 00:41:14,877
Come to my room.
Let's see what else is there.

687
00:41:15,495 --> 00:41:19,290
Show your other clothes. Strip
clothes from the closet, baby.

688
00:41:19,291 --> 00:41:22,001
- Show me. Give here.
- These clothes?

689
00:41:22,002 --> 00:41:26,817
Clothes are a bitch, baby!

690
00:41:26,854 --> 00:41:31,177
- Look at this shit.
- Please stop, Al

691
00:41:31,178 --> 00:41:35,826
- Clothes are a bitch!
- Do not do it, Al

692
00:41:36,934 --> 00:41:43,106
Please, Al, Sorry.
Never talk to anyone.

693
00:41:43,108 --> 00:41:45,630
Shit!

694
00:41:46,569 --> 00:41:50,381
Ok, come here.
Look in the mirror.

695
00:41:50,382 --> 00:41:54,551
Come on, look in the mirror.

696
00:41:54,587 --> 00:41:57,788
You see?

697
00:41:57,824 --> 00:41:59,874
Tell me.

698
00:41:59,875 --> 00:42:03,775
- Say it's a bitch.
- Stop it, Al!

699
00:42:03,838 --> 00:42:06,965
Say it's a bitch!

700
00:42:06,966 --> 00:42:12,471
- I'm a bitch!
- Say you love me.

701
00:42:12,472 --> 00:42:15,808
- Say you love me.
- I love you.

702
00:42:15,809 --> 00:42:18,394
Says he wants to suck my dick.

703
00:42:18,395 --> 00:42:21,147
I want to suck your dick!

704
00:42:21,148 --> 00:42:26,128
Honey.

705
00:42:27,821 --> 00:42:31,247
- I'll cut your hair!
- No!

706
00:42:34,425 --> 00:42:38,220
Stay still,
you'll learn.

707
00:42:38,256 --> 00:42:42,461
It is the only way
will learn.

708
00:42:42,462 --> 00:42:47,299
It is the only way
will learn.

709
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:49,307
Come here!

710
00:42:54,224 --> 00:42:59,896
I want to spend the rest of my
life with you, your fucking bitch!

711
00:43:06,279 --> 00:43:12,469
Al!

712
00:43:17,332 --> 00:43:22,295
I'll buy a mirror
new for you tomorrow, love.

713
00:43:22,296 --> 00:43:25,381
No excuse for
treating people like him.

714
00:43:25,382 --> 00:43:29,466
There are people who had a
childhood worse than that of Al,

715
00:43:29,467 --> 00:43:31,805
and end up doing
great things.

716
00:43:31,806 --> 00:43:35,559
Become a
model of citizenship.

717
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:40,564
As a secretary who knew
who had a horrible childhood. Type:

718
00:43:40,565 --> 00:43:46,506
Too horrible to talk about: Rape;
incest, eating with hands, etc..

719
00:43:47,739 --> 00:43:52,743
But he lived with a smile on
face and everything was wonderful.

720
00:43:52,745 --> 00:43:56,776
She was funny. Nothing
like this animal: Al

721
00:43:57,265 --> 00:43:59,792
Death penalty.

722
00:43:59,828 --> 00:44:04,381
Shoot him. It has to be
be swift and brutal.

723
00:44:04,382 --> 00:44:10,137
Okay. Okay?

724
00:44:10,138 --> 00:44:12,556
- You have to go, Vic.
- What?

725
00:44:12,557 --> 00:44:16,310
You have to go, why ...

726
00:44:16,311 --> 00:44:19,921
I do not want trouble.
You have to go.

727
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:24,176
I'm not going nowhere.
You come to my house with me.

728
00:44:24,177 --> 00:44:26,017
- No.
- What are you doing?

729
00:44:26,018 --> 00:44:30,123
I can not. He turns back
me. You know him.

730
00:44:30,159 --> 00:44:33,383
Do not want to get in trouble
More, please.

731
00:44:33,384 --> 00:44:36,434
I'm scared.

732
00:44:37,059 --> 00:44:38,740
I'll turn it all inside.

733
00:44:38,839 --> 00:44:40,778
I'll be fine.

734
00:44:40,814 --> 00:44:45,770
As can be
with him after that?

735
00:44:45,771 --> 00:44:47,009
I love him.

736
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:50,084
I love fucking.

737
00:44:50,085 --> 00:44:52,515
This is sick. Love does not
would cause suffering.

738
00:44:52,516 --> 00:44:57,869
- But I love you, Vic.
- It was because of weapons?

739
00:44:57,870 --> 00:45:01,759
It was not.
He was just jealous.

740
00:45:03,277 --> 00:45:05,445
- Who is it?
- Reilly.

741
00:45:05,446 --> 00:45:08,532
Do not let anyone enter.

742
00:45:11,705 --> 00:45:16,878
Jesus Christ, are you okay?

743
00:45:18,168 --> 00:45:21,170
But what the fuck.
Sit.

744
00:45:21,171 --> 00:45:23,256
It was the Al

745
00:45:23,257 --> 00:45:25,341
Son of a bitch down!

746
00:45:25,342 --> 00:45:27,427
He beats women.
How did this happen?

747
00:45:27,428 --> 00:45:30,347
Do not be so surprised,
was not the first time.

748
00:45:30,348 --> 00:45:32,599
It'll be okay, honey.

749
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:35,310
Okay nothing
It was you who made him do it.

750
00:45:35,311 --> 00:45:37,396
- Are you one of them.
- How so?

751
00:45:37,397 --> 00:45:39,481
I did nothing.

752
00:45:39,482 --> 00:45:41,898
Al does not work pro

753
00:45:41,899 --> 00:45:44,695
Clancy and other guys did.
I swear. Come here.

754
00:45:44,696 --> 00:45:48,421
- Reilly.
- Easy. It'll be fine.

755
00:45:48,422 --> 00:45:50,743
I do everything I want.
You decide.

756
00:45:50,744 --> 00:45:53,277
It's just bullshit. You all
are full of crap.

757
00:45:53,278 --> 00:45:55,265
I'll get your stuff.

758
00:45:55,301 --> 00:45:57,751
And let's get you out because
can not stay here anymore.

759
00:45:57,752 --> 00:46:01,463
- Come to my house. It will be better.
- I will not go with anyone!

760
00:46:01,464 --> 00:46:05,628
I'll wait and when he'll return
break his face in front of you!

761
00:46:07,137 --> 00:46:11,369
- Stay here?
- Honey, okay, sorry.

762
00:46:11,406 --> 00:46:15,075
- Should not have done it, Al!
- Get outta my house!

763
00:46:15,076 --> 00:46:16,812
- Go fuck yourself!
- Do not touch it!

764
00:46:16,813 --> 00:46:19,273
I was playing, you do not
deserve, you bastard!

765
00:46:19,274 --> 00:46:21,359
- So try it!
- Reilly!

766
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:25,071
- Stop!
- Reilly out of him!

767
00:46:28,451 --> 00:46:30,535
Beware! Come on!

768
00:46:30,536 --> 00:46:33,938
- Look at the fucking gun!
- You're hurting him out!

769
00:46:34,290 --> 00:46:39,211
You're hurting,
Reilly, stop!

770
00:46:39,212 --> 00:46:43,682
Oh, my God!
Let Kat, get out there!

771
00:46:55,855 --> 00:46:59,433
They were very noisy.

772
00:46:59,435 --> 00:47:02,833
I'll just say this.
I do not want trouble.

773
00:47:02,834 --> 00:47:06,882
What happened behind those
doors was not of my business.

774
00:47:11,371 --> 00:47:16,584
- Let me see let Al?
- I'm here to help you, and not Al

775
00:47:16,585 --> 00:47:20,421
Think you believe it?
You think I'm stupid?

776
00:47:20,422 --> 00:47:24,484
I know you want me to help you
Al to put in jail forever?

777
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:26,894
I will not have anything to do with it.
Got it?

778
00:47:26,930 --> 00:47:31,102
I do not know what Al did in
past and honestly do not care.

779
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:35,176
I'm here because I was responsible
his case, to help you.

780
00:47:35,213 --> 00:47:38,524
This is my job. Phallus
with battered women.

781
00:47:38,525 --> 00:47:43,654
Battered women?
What the hell does that mean?

782
00:47:43,655 --> 00:47:49,535
I am a bacon beaten?
What are you talking about?

783
00:47:49,536 --> 00:47:54,232
Come on, Kat.
It's obvious that he hurt you.

784
00:47:54,375 --> 00:47:59,243
He hit me, so what?

785
00:47:59,244 --> 00:48:02,424
He rarely hits me.

786
00:48:02,425 --> 00:48:05,344
This was not a
simple beating.

787
00:48:05,345 --> 00:48:08,746
Will wait until next time,
until you kill him?

788
00:48:16,190 --> 00:48:20,007
- It was not his intention?
- Listen.

789
00:48:20,402 --> 00:48:23,780
You can protect yourself.
Talk to me.

790
00:48:23,781 --> 00:48:26,382
Nothing to say
will leave this room.

791
00:48:26,383 --> 00:48:30,787
Yeah, right. The
walls have ears.

792
00:48:30,788 --> 00:48:35,042
I am not asking
handed over her boyfriend.

793
00:48:35,043 --> 00:48:38,014
Right? Just wondering:

794
00:48:38,015 --> 00:48:43,360
As a man who loves a
woman would do this to her?

795
00:48:43,844 --> 00:48:47,933
And why a woman
would you be with him?

796
00:48:49,975 --> 00:48:52,609
Needless to say
nothing if not want.

797
00:48:52,610 --> 00:48:56,362
We could only stay
sitting here for a while.

798
00:48:58,192 --> 00:49:01,128
He cut my hair.

799
00:49:07,661 --> 00:49:12,372
Jesus! It was an accident, okay?
I have not tried to kill her!

800
00:49:12,373 --> 00:49:14,309
Was it murder
the bullet had caught her.

801
00:49:14,310 --> 00:49:18,646
But only got grazed. Was a
accident. I never kill Kat!

802
00:49:18,683 --> 00:49:21,508
She sucks better
all in NY.

803
00:49:21,509 --> 00:49:25,591
- I see you have it in high esteem.
- Okay, look ...

804
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:31,727
If a woman that upon
his face, would not want to hurt her?

805
00:49:31,728 --> 00:49:34,355
Not worth it
by killing anyone.

806
00:49:34,356 --> 00:49:37,817
I think you
Kat never proved.

807
00:49:38,235 --> 00:49:42,673
So ... married?

808
00:49:42,987 --> 00:49:45,263
Divorced.

809
00:49:45,909 --> 00:49:47,854
Lonely?

810
00:49:47,855 --> 00:49:51,181
No way. My work
keeps me very busy.

811
00:49:58,798 --> 00:50:01,175
You want to fuck me, right?

812
00:50:01,176 --> 00:50:04,929
It can be hard to believe you,
but I can resist its charm.

813
00:50:08,306 --> 00:50:09,705
You'd be the first.

814
00:50:09,742 --> 00:50:13,133
And his girlfriend who is
a point of giving out on you?

815
00:50:13,170 --> 00:50:14,897
What would she say if you
hear talking like that?

816
00:50:14,898 --> 00:50:17,529
Please do not be so dramatic.
I'm not going nowhere,

817
00:50:17,530 --> 00:50:21,230
not to be home.
Home sweet home. Bet.

818
00:50:22,304 --> 00:50:26,297
Kat is not going to complain.
She can not live without me, you dig?

819
00:50:26,411 --> 00:50:28,464
She loves me.

820
00:50:30,665 --> 00:50:36,045
- So what do you think of me?
- What is homicidal and psychopathic.

821
00:50:36,046 --> 00:50:39,340
And if you stay on the streets,
'll probably kill someone.

822
00:50:39,341 --> 00:50:45,032
- Maybe himself.
- Do not say that or I'll kill you!

823
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:49,684
What's the matter with you,
you moron! You're tough?

824
00:50:49,685 --> 00:50:53,041
More than me?
If you feel funny, Clancy.

825
00:50:53,077 --> 00:50:54,606
But I know you.

826
00:50:54,607 --> 00:50:57,403
She just said she was talking
with the Puerto Rican.

827
00:50:57,439 --> 00:51:00,099
Fuck you, asshole, I
I know you're a jerk.

828
00:51:00,136 --> 00:51:03,040
A despicable coward with foot odor.

829
00:51:03,076 --> 00:51:06,041
And Kat was beaten by
Because of what you said.

830
00:51:06,078 --> 00:51:09,309
Bullshit. She deserved it.
You can not trust her.

831
00:51:09,346 --> 00:51:11,415
Beware what you say, Clancy.

832
00:51:11,416 --> 00:51:14,127
I'm talking to look after you
life, or get hurt.

833
00:51:14,128 --> 00:51:16,716
- Are you threatening me?
- Fuck.

834
00:51:16,717 --> 00:51:18,834
You do not have
bother me.

835
00:51:18,835 --> 00:51:23,804
Has the Kat Reilly, Latinos.
Do you think Jose will leave cheap?

836
00:51:23,805 --> 00:51:29,560
Think? I'm talking to fend for himself.
The fish dies by the mouth.

837
00:51:29,596 --> 00:51:31,162
You're not me
leaving scared.

838
00:51:31,271 --> 00:51:35,941
I'm not? Then you're retarded!
See you at the morgue, genius.

839
00:51:35,942 --> 00:51:38,694
I do not plan to live
here all my life.

840
00:51:38,695 --> 00:51:40,746
Dream of leaving here.

841
00:51:42,006 --> 00:51:45,683
Al and I have plans to go
to the beach or something.

842
00:51:45,870 --> 00:51:49,372
This year out
but maybe next year.

843
00:51:49,373 --> 00:51:52,876
- Likes the beach?
- Yes.

844
00:51:52,877 --> 00:51:58,173
I love the beach. Al has promised to
get a place for us there.

845
00:51:58,174 --> 00:52:00,788
No need for that Al.

846
00:52:00,790 --> 00:52:03,703
You'll be surprised at the
much you can do alone.

847
00:52:03,805 --> 00:52:07,224
- Better stop here.
- Why?

848
00:52:07,225 --> 00:52:10,311
I do not want trouble.

849
00:52:10,312 --> 00:52:14,212
I have neighbors who will talk.

850
00:52:15,651 --> 00:52:20,678
Call me, ok? Come on.

851
00:52:21,949 --> 00:52:24,591
You'll get in trouble.

852
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:19,293
Slag!

853
00:53:21,721 --> 00:53:25,709
What was in my head?

854
00:53:28,186 --> 00:53:31,480
Fucking prick!

855
00:53:31,481 --> 00:53:37,236
Someone should have killed Al ago
long. I've thought about it, but ...

856
00:53:37,237 --> 00:53:43,159
I could not. We had spent
through a lot together e. ..

857
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:46,351
Would not it be nice
do this, you know?

858
00:53:46,352 --> 00:53:50,425
It's something in the neighborhood.
We have rules.

859
00:53:50,626 --> 00:53:55,547
Of course we fight.

860
00:53:55,548 --> 00:53:59,864
We did not go much in agreement
times. Most of the time.

861
00:53:59,886 --> 00:54:03,994
But it would have been nice.

862
00:54:04,891 --> 00:54:07,810
- Hi, trouble.
- Hi

863
00:54:07,811 --> 00:54:12,340
- On the house.
- I can not accept anything stolen.

864
00:54:13,234 --> 00:54:16,569
Are you kidding?
I did not steal it, was the Al

865
00:54:16,571 --> 00:54:20,750
Handle at once.
Do not leave me no way, ok?

866
00:54:20,751 --> 00:54:22,465
Okay.

867
00:54:23,245 --> 00:54:25,501
Want to join?

868
00:54:26,039 --> 00:54:29,524
- Yes.
- Come in.

869
00:54:30,502 --> 00:54:34,380
- I'll make some toast for you.
- Ok

870
00:54:34,381 --> 00:54:39,844
Listen. Al will be free in 24 hours
you have to make a decision.

871
00:54:39,845 --> 00:54:42,603
Make a complaint or get
a court order.

872
00:54:42,604 --> 00:54:45,392
How do you know so much about Al?

873
00:54:45,393 --> 00:54:50,005
Because I was married
with a man like him.

874
00:54:50,106 --> 00:54:54,385
- Wow.
- I'll show you something.

875
00:54:56,705 --> 00:54:58,478
Jesus Christ.

876
00:55:00,492 --> 00:55:05,555
- When was that?
- 6 years ago.

877
00:55:06,206 --> 00:55:10,636
After I left,
I returned to school,

878
00:55:11,458 --> 00:55:13,992
I got my diploma.

879
00:55:14,966 --> 00:55:18,722
- You're mad.
- My life has changed for the better.

880
00:55:18,723 --> 00:55:23,876
Changed. Leaving it was the
Best thing I ever did.

881
00:55:25,435 --> 00:55:27,770
- I'm afraid.
- You can.

882
00:55:27,771 --> 00:55:32,217
He was not afraid
he was behind you?

883
00:55:34,653 --> 00:55:40,392
I could not give more
the luxury of being scared.

884
00:55:46,791 --> 00:55:49,501
- Hi
- Hi, Reilly.

885
00:55:53,236 --> 00:55:54,909
Any news?

886
00:55:56,468 --> 00:55:59,346
- No, and you?
- No.

887
00:56:01,556 --> 00:56:03,902
- Beer.
- Ok

888
00:56:07,139 --> 00:56:08,369
Take.

889
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:18,799
I'll kill him.

890
00:56:21,661 --> 00:56:24,059
I'll kill the bastard.

891
00:56:27,834 --> 00:56:31,485
This must be the thing
smarter than I said.

892
00:56:35,676 --> 00:56:40,118
It's here. Where I live.

893
00:56:40,493 --> 00:56:43,328
Is there another place to live?

894
00:56:43,329 --> 00:56:46,681
Can I stay in the house
my friend Vic, but ...

895
00:56:47,522 --> 00:56:49,773
I do not think that is
a good idea.

896
00:56:49,774 --> 00:56:55,487
- Why not?
- Because I get the couch ...

897
00:56:55,488 --> 00:56:59,009
and end up in her bed. Got it?

898
00:57:01,578 --> 00:57:03,704
What?

899
00:57:04,331 --> 00:57:07,587
Upset by having you
slept with a girl?

900
00:57:08,711 --> 00:57:11,254
There is ...

901
00:57:11,255 --> 00:57:14,508
No. Why?

902
00:57:14,509 --> 00:57:16,635
I always say: Each one in his.

903
00:57:16,636 --> 00:57:21,499
Each one in his.
Also always say that.

904
00:57:24,227 --> 00:57:27,399
Each one in his.

905
00:57:28,649 --> 00:57:33,510
You're so tense. Relax.

906
00:57:34,530 --> 00:57:40,554
Moreover, it is the end of
block. Not far enough.

907
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:45,980
He could find us
easily there, you know.

908
00:57:46,292 --> 00:57:50,420
- You could stay here.
- I could not accept that.

909
00:57:50,422 --> 00:57:55,235
No problem.
I have a room.

910
00:57:56,178 --> 00:57:59,513
- I think, thanks.
- Listen.

911
00:57:59,514 --> 00:58:03,851
You are a woman with
power and need to use.

912
00:58:03,852 --> 00:58:08,275
Lips, nipples, hips.

913
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:11,193
You're all woman.

914
00:58:11,230 --> 00:58:12,602
Have to think so.

915
00:58:12,603 --> 00:58:16,657
Use your power of woman
to change your life.

916
00:58:16,658 --> 00:58:20,345
- I slept with a woman?
- No.

917
00:58:22,914 --> 00:58:27,941
- It's me singing?
- Maybe. Wants me to be?

918
00:58:28,003 --> 00:58:29,533
Mean. Come on.

919
00:58:33,425 --> 00:58:36,928
We're talking "helps"
huh?

920
00:58:36,929 --> 00:58:40,640
I'm not helping you
for that reason.

921
00:58:40,641 --> 00:58:44,394
And contradicting what you think,
not everyone wants something from you.

922
00:58:44,395 --> 00:58:45,991
I'm doing here
my duty ...

923
00:58:45,992 --> 00:58:48,690
and not to take advantage of you.

924
00:58:49,166 --> 00:58:51,351
I swear.

925
00:58:52,526 --> 00:58:53,969
Really?

926
00:58:54,005 --> 00:58:57,922
No thanks. I do not believe
anything you're saying.

927
00:58:58,410 --> 00:59:01,277
Nobody does anything for free.

928
00:59:03,749 --> 00:59:06,135
When I was 9 years ...

929
00:59:07,270 --> 00:59:13,015
He told me he wanted
I had never been born.

930
00:59:15,219 --> 00:59:18,907
He said
never wanted children.

931
00:59:18,932 --> 00:59:21,515
But he lived in the mood to climb by

932
00:59:21,516 --> 00:59:24,245
Because of his incredible
sexual drive.

933
00:59:24,281 --> 00:59:27,049
So he could not
take your hands off my mother.

934
00:59:27,702 --> 00:59:29,282
So I told him ...

935
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:34,387
That's no excuse. If not
want children did not.

936
00:59:34,490 --> 00:59:38,390
Has many children
junk out there, right?

937
00:59:38,953 --> 00:59:41,492
Eat your ass bitch.

938
00:59:41,493 --> 00:59:45,754
This is my solution pro
birth control.

939
00:59:46,142 --> 00:59:48,631
Turn the bitch and eat my ass.

940
01:00:03,604 --> 01:00:05,897
- How are you?
- Al

941
01:00:05,898 --> 01:00:09,025
I'll call the Vic and Liz,
they are down there.

942
01:00:09,026 --> 01:00:11,737
- And I'll call the police.
- It will not.

943
01:00:11,738 --> 01:00:13,163
You should not be here.

944
01:00:13,164 --> 01:00:15,741
Do not make things more
difficult than they are.

945
01:00:15,742 --> 01:00:19,620
I do not want that bitch
Come in here to investigate.

946
01:00:19,621 --> 01:00:22,957
I warn you, okay?

947
01:00:22,958 --> 01:00:26,811
Do not want her to come here.
I warn you.

948
01:00:28,505 --> 01:00:30,784
Come here.

949
01:00:33,844 --> 01:00:36,553
I think she never had
luck with men, but ...

950
01:00:36,554 --> 01:00:39,391
she never knew how
keep a man.

951
01:00:39,392 --> 01:00:44,555
I, for one, am married and happy
My fourth husband for two years.

952
01:00:44,556 --> 01:00:45,935
It works.

953
01:00:45,936 --> 01:00:49,548
Gerdie. Could close this
maw and cook something for me?

954
01:00:49,549 --> 01:00:52,615
Shut your fat mouth!

955
01:00:52,616 --> 01:00:56,008
We'll eat when
I want to, ok?

956
01:00:59,705 --> 01:01:02,707
I do not know where she got
her problem with men.

957
01:01:02,708 --> 01:01:06,110
Perhaps her father.
He's crazy.

958
01:01:06,671 --> 01:01:10,854
Clancy said he saw you talking
with the Puerto Rican again.

959
01:01:10,855 --> 01:01:13,724
- I have not spoken with him, okay?
- I wanted to suck his dick?

960
01:01:13,725 --> 01:01:16,315
- No, I want to suck his dick!
- Admit it!

961
01:01:16,333 --> 01:01:19,662
So why not respond?
You must be thinking?

962
01:01:19,664 --> 01:01:25,592
- You have to think?
- No! 're Making me nervous!

963
01:01:25,691 --> 01:01:25,984
Right.

964
01:01:25,985 --> 01:01:28,317
It seems I'm the "Million-Dollar Show."

965
01:01:28,318 --> 01:01:30,486
Shit!

966
01:01:30,487 --> 01:01:34,240
Go away at the first sign
of a domestic disturbance?

967
01:01:34,241 --> 01:01:40,384
- Oh, no Al, Al
- What?

968
01:01:40,421 --> 01:01:45,252
Insanity is not a
domestic disturbance!

969
01:01:45,253 --> 01:01:50,216
It is a disease that rots.
And you're crazy.

970
01:01:50,217 --> 01:01:53,452
- Ok
- Let me go, please.

971
01:01:53,512 --> 01:01:56,347
Promise not to beat
most of you, ok?

972
01:01:56,348 --> 01:01:58,474
You said that last time.

973
01:01:58,475 --> 01:02:00,560
- This time it's for real, ok?
- No.

974
01:02:00,561 --> 01:02:02,645
- I need some time.
- This time it's for real.

975
01:02:02,646 --> 01:02:04,731
I need some time
to think, ok?

976
01:02:04,732 --> 01:02:06,816
- Do not go.
- See if I can forgive you!

977
01:02:06,818 --> 01:02:09,319
- For God's sake!
- Save that shit!

978
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:12,072
Keep that shit!
You're not going anywhere!

979
01:02:12,073 --> 01:02:13,712
Do not touch me.

980
01:02:14,782 --> 01:02:16,938
- Do not touch me.
- Do not say I can do!

981
01:02:16,961 --> 01:02:19,872
I am your master! Centimeter
by inch, you're mine.

982
01:02:19,873 --> 01:02:23,649
- I am your master! Ok?
- Al ..

983
01:02:23,808 --> 01:02:27,964
I will ask a court order
to expel you.

984
01:02:27,965 --> 01:02:31,509
- I'm right.
- I got the chick!

985
01:02:31,510 --> 01:02:35,359
You do not have any power.
I have. You are a woman!

986
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:39,142
I make your face to bits
if you request a court order.

987
01:02:39,143 --> 01:02:41,611
You will not be able
come near me.

988
01:02:41,612 --> 01:02:43,355
Or accurate.
Send someone to do.

989
01:02:43,356 --> 01:02:46,609
I'll be sitting
here watching TV.

990
01:02:46,610 --> 01:02:48,574
As your face
is being shredded.

991
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:51,238
Will I have three witnesses.
Police. My friends.

992
01:02:51,239 --> 01:02:53,780
And when your face
is being punched,

993
01:02:53,781 --> 01:02:57,787
and you'll be here
have no proof.

994
01:02:57,788 --> 01:02:59,315
So ...

995
01:03:00,161 --> 01:03:02,878
Will be so ugly when
crawl back to me ...

996
01:03:02,879 --> 01:03:04,357
neither will
want to see you anymore.

997
01:03:04,359 --> 01:03:07,547
- Kat, c'mon!
- Sit down.

998
01:03:07,548 --> 01:03:09,906
Neither move.

999
01:03:15,390 --> 01:03:19,556
- Kat? Okay?
- What the hell is he doing here?

1000
01:03:19,557 --> 01:03:22,438
He says he came back.

1001
01:03:22,439 --> 01:03:25,240
- Vic.
- She will be with me.

1002
01:03:25,241 --> 01:03:27,738
Listen, Kat. Remember
as we speak.

1003
01:03:27,739 --> 01:03:30,155
Can I call the police
now if you want.

1004
01:03:30,156 --> 01:03:33,533
- Say you'll stay.
- It'll be fine.

1005
01:03:33,534 --> 01:03:38,728
- Put them away from home.
- They could go?

1006
01:03:38,790 --> 01:03:42,554
We will reach an agreement.

1007
01:03:42,555 --> 01:03:45,982
I do not want trouble,
ok, please?

1008
01:03:46,006 --> 01:03:49,157
- Kat.
- Okay?

1009
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:53,595
Listen, Albert.

1010
01:03:53,596 --> 01:03:56,766
If hurt, not
I'm your girlfriend.

1011
01:03:56,767 --> 01:04:00,478
- I'll kill you.
- I'm scared to death, okay?

1012
01:04:00,479 --> 01:04:03,370
- For really should.
- Your black fucking.

1013
01:04:03,371 --> 01:04:06,300
Get out of my house to
I eat my pussy.

1014
01:04:06,337 --> 01:04:08,403
I swear at what you want.

1015
01:04:08,404 --> 01:04:13,495
If you hit it again,
will be between you and me. Got it?

1016
01:04:16,872 --> 01:04:20,985
- Kat?
- Please, go.

1017
01:04:22,002 --> 01:04:25,307
It'll be fine. It is a matter
particularly among the people.

1018
01:04:25,308 --> 01:04:27,196
Go fuck yourself!

1019
01:04:29,051 --> 01:04:32,029
Do not make me get up.

1020
01:04:42,482 --> 01:04:46,735
I married at 18, with a guy who
thought to be a Prince Charming.

1021
01:04:46,737 --> 01:04:51,302
- But it was a frog, right?
- Right.

1022
01:04:52,743 --> 01:04:57,247
But he tricked me for a while.
Louquinha I was the guy.

1023
01:04:57,248 --> 01:05:00,408
You were young.
Maybe it was just louquinha.

1024
01:05:00,409 --> 01:05:02,189
Or wrong.

1025
01:05:02,712 --> 01:05:03,979
Probably both.

1026
01:05:03,980 --> 01:05:07,943
At first it was great.

1027
01:05:08,551 --> 01:05:14,451
But then he began to
drink and act like Al

1028
01:05:15,892 --> 01:05:21,751
I was 6 months pregnant.
A girl. Tess.

1029
01:05:22,691 --> 01:05:27,070
He came home drunk one night
and began to fight over ...

1030
01:05:27,071 --> 01:05:31,434
drink all or nothing.

1031
01:05:33,035 --> 01:05:36,914
Then he began to
beat me without stopping.

1032
01:05:36,915 --> 01:05:40,065
Somehow, I escaped and
I ran screaming down the hall ...

1033
01:05:40,066 --> 01:05:42,920
and neighbors
called the police.

1034
01:05:42,921 --> 01:05:46,447
Again. E. ..

1035
01:05:46,448 --> 01:05:50,624
I reached the top of the staircase
and he reached me ...

1036
01:05:51,305 --> 01:05:54,564
He hit me so hard ...

1037
01:05:57,019 --> 01:05:59,727
I fell down the stairs e. ..

1038
01:06:02,483 --> 01:06:04,366
I lost the baby.

1039
01:06:08,823 --> 01:06:12,723
- Sorry.
- Ok

1040
01:06:14,413 --> 01:06:18,833
Nor was the place to get
my clothes and things.

1041
01:06:18,834 --> 01:06:24,276
It did not come see me at the hospital.
I was so angry.

1042
01:06:31,514 --> 01:06:36,826
Men are dogs. One day
will wake up and start barking.

1043
01:06:36,895 --> 01:06:38,994
Right.

1044
01:06:40,857 --> 01:06:47,095
But I would love to help Kat
then ... if you think of something ...

1045
01:06:48,866 --> 01:06:52,619
- Anything.
- E. ..?

1046
01:06:52,620 --> 01:06:56,473
- Let me know, ok?
- Yes.

1047
01:06:56,791 --> 01:07:01,818
You're screwing me.
Are you listening?

1048
01:07:02,588 --> 01:07:07,450
You fucking bitch!

1049
01:07:10,597 --> 01:07:14,183
- Why does not speak my name!
- Al

1050
01:07:14,184 --> 01:07:18,148
- Say it!
- Al!

1051
01:07:38,084 --> 01:07:40,502
What are you suggesting?

1052
01:07:40,504 --> 01:07:43,121
If Kat is not strong
enough to drop the Al,

1053
01:07:43,122 --> 01:07:46,267
maybe he needs
Drop it.

1054
01:07:46,268 --> 01:07:51,494
- He'll never do that.
- Perhaps not willingly.

1055
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:53,826
What are you saying?

1056
01:07:56,062 --> 01:08:01,089
You seem to follow the rules and
My suggestion is a bit risky.

1057
01:08:02,860 --> 01:08:07,757
- Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
- You bastard. I loved it.

1058
01:08:08,408 --> 01:08:10,599
Go ahead.

1059
01:08:11,578 --> 01:08:15,831
A friend of mine has just
with Al for a price.

1060
01:08:15,833 --> 01:08:21,421
Wait.
We have not had that conversation.

1061
01:08:21,422 --> 01:08:23,978
He's not so expensive
can crack.

1062
01:08:23,979 --> 01:08:27,678
Crack? We are not
talking about dinner.

1063
01:08:27,679 --> 01:08:31,006
You're talking about murder.
You crazy?

1064
01:08:31,007 --> 01:08:35,293
It's the only way we get her out
His stay with me for her.

1065
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:41,484
You are in love with her?

1066
01:08:41,485 --> 01:08:45,363
Would do anything for her.
I'm mad about her.

1067
01:08:45,364 --> 01:08:47,584
Or maybe it's just crazy.

1068
01:08:47,585 --> 01:08:50,577
Realized that is
talking about murder?

1069
01:08:50,578 --> 01:08:52,559
You said: Who does not
ventured, nothing gained.

1070
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:54,073
He was talking of arming.

1071
01:08:54,074 --> 01:08:57,944
Or something, was not
talking about killing anyone. Christ!

1072
01:08:58,377 --> 01:09:02,154
Known me for 2 hours and wants
I'm an accomplice to murder.

1073
01:09:02,178 --> 01:09:03,841
I do not want more.

1074
01:09:03,842 --> 01:09:07,868
Do you think this neighborhood
are above the law, but are not.

1075
01:09:10,766 --> 01:09:13,357
This is not the old west.

1076
01:09:13,852 --> 01:09:15,947
It's what you think.

1077
01:09:17,294 --> 01:09:18,805
Fuck!

1078
01:09:18,842 --> 01:09:21,526
Unleash the Al!

1079
01:09:21,527 --> 01:09:24,726
I think I did not understand something, okay?

1080
01:09:25,144 --> 01:09:29,895
Still not finished with him.
Got it?

1081
01:09:37,878 --> 01:09:41,154
- Like it?
- Gives pro spent.

1082
01:09:42,674 --> 01:09:48,414
I thought I'd take care of the problem.
What happened? Giving back?

1083
01:09:48,681 --> 01:09:51,057
I thought you would handle it.

1084
01:09:53,227 --> 01:09:55,198
I'm working on it.

1085
01:09:57,843 --> 01:09:59,491
I like you.

1086
01:10:01,778 --> 01:10:06,196
Idem.
Despite being a man.

1087
01:10:07,659 --> 01:10:13,748
Know. Big Al was a major cause
death in the neighborhood for a while.

1088
01:10:13,749 --> 01:10:16,793
Are you saying that
Many want him dead?

1089
01:10:16,794 --> 01:10:21,655
I am saying that we live
a very dangerous neighborhood.

1090
01:10:21,799 --> 01:10:27,657
- Everyone has to be careful.
- That's exactly what I say.

1091
01:10:29,224 --> 01:10:33,519
Do not let me learn that
Reilly is talking to or Vic.

1092
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:36,220
I would say I love you very much.

1093
01:10:36,222 --> 01:10:38,053
Do not worry.
I will not talk to anyone.

1094
01:10:38,089 --> 01:10:39,775
- If you will not have trouble, ok?
- Ok

1095
01:10:39,776 --> 01:10:41,924
A kiss.

1096
01:10:43,530 --> 01:10:45,678
Right.

1097
01:10:59,464 --> 01:11:01,410
I have 2 hours.

1098
01:11:06,721 --> 01:11:10,766
- We have two hours.
- Yes, that's all I need.

1099
01:11:10,767 --> 01:11:15,495
Hey. I wish I had saved my
first time for you.

1100
01:11:15,496 --> 01:11:19,174
- Really?
- I wanted to be a virgin for you, Reilly.

1101
01:11:19,211 --> 01:11:20,899
Fuck.

1102
01:11:22,363 --> 01:11:24,275
What?

1103
01:11:24,485 --> 01:11:28,112
Do anything
to get rid of him.

1104
01:11:28,161 --> 01:11:30,878
Do anything
to get rid of him.

1105
01:11:30,879 --> 01:11:33,875
- Anything?
- Yes, It will get rid of it?

1106
01:11:33,876 --> 01:11:36,836
I promise I'll take care
it for you.

1107
01:11:36,837 --> 01:11:39,254
Promise?

1108
01:11:42,509 --> 01:11:47,222
I wish I had saved my
first time for you, Vic.

1109
01:11:47,223 --> 01:11:51,704
I wanted to be a virgin
you, Vic. You know why.

1110
01:11:51,978 --> 01:11:57,316
I can not stand. Every time he would
rings, just think of you, Vic.

1111
01:11:57,317 --> 01:12:01,217
Do not take it anymore.

1112
01:12:01,655 --> 01:12:06,267
Kat knew exactly what
is doing. She's smart.

1113
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:09,412
She goes by the numbers.

1114
01:12:09,413 --> 01:12:12,840
Playing. Taking risks.
playing with odds.

1115
01:12:15,252 --> 01:12:17,484
If she wanted something for Christmas.

1116
01:12:17,485 --> 01:12:20,715
She talked to 4 people
buy the same thing ...

1117
01:12:20,716 --> 01:12:24,118
She estimated that
that one would meet.

1118
01:12:27,140 --> 01:12:29,563
And she was right.

1119
01:12:40,988 --> 01:12:42,793
Nobody has ever climbed
better than you.

1120
01:12:42,794 --> 01:12:45,657
- Will do what I want?
- Yes.

1121
01:12:45,658 --> 01:12:50,741
She got everybody backpack.

1122
01:13:07,516 --> 01:13:09,600
Not happy
everything is back to normal?

1123
01:13:09,601 --> 01:13:11,686
- Yes.
- I was wrong?

1124
01:13:11,687 --> 01:13:13,243
Yes

1125
01:13:16,567 --> 01:13:21,843
You always right, Al

1126
01:13:21,948 --> 01:13:25,306
- What is it?
- What?

1127
01:13:26,958 --> 01:13:28,675
Right.

1128
01:13:32,667 --> 01:13:36,309
- I love you.
- Me too.

1129
01:13:37,881 --> 01:13:42,927
Listen, I want to take you ...
I will return here after dinner.

1130
01:13:42,928 --> 01:13:46,097
I want to get a sophisticated place.
Take you out.

1131
01:13:46,098 --> 01:13:51,019
No. How come?
We were going to stay here and make dinner.

1132
01:13:51,020 --> 01:13:53,105
- Making big beans.
- I want to take you to ...

1133
01:13:53,106 --> 01:13:55,190
French restaurant
one near the ...

1134
01:13:55,191 --> 01:13:57,898
- Near the market.
- Hey, Al ..

1135
01:13:57,902 --> 01:14:00,029
- Al
- Where's my jacket?

1136
01:14:00,030 --> 01:14:01,967
You know ...

1137
01:14:02,361 --> 01:14:08,189
I have a new fantasy
Crazy that I've been plotting.

1138
01:14:08,455 --> 01:14:12,500
And I wanted to experiment with you.

1139
01:14:12,501 --> 01:14:16,254
- Okay?
- I think so.

1140
01:14:16,255 --> 01:14:19,587
I know that you love so much.

1141
01:14:20,134 --> 01:14:22,469
- I want that.
- Yeah?

1142
01:14:23,462 --> 01:14:24,555
Ok

1143
01:14:24,556 --> 01:14:26,175
Where's my jacket?

1144
01:14:28,476 --> 01:14:30,936
- Why not ...
- The jacket written Big Al?

1145
01:14:30,937 --> 01:14:34,023
Do not use the Big Al
I bought a new one, where is it?

1146
01:14:34,024 --> 01:14:35,697
Want to Big Al

1147
01:14:35,698 --> 01:14:39,021
Why? There it is.
I bought a new beautiful.

1148
01:14:39,022 --> 01:14:42,075
Come on, honey. For me.

1149
01:14:44,577 --> 01:14:46,786
Ok

1150
01:14:46,787 --> 01:14:49,883
The problem is that Al
he never thought big.

1151
01:14:49,884 --> 01:14:51,625
It was always a
foot-and-shame.

1152
01:14:51,626 --> 01:14:54,336
But he found
someone Height: Kat.

1153
01:14:54,337 --> 01:14:59,594
I'm saying.
That's smart. Tough.

1154
01:14:59,634 --> 01:15:02,838
There was a period in her life in
that every guy who goes out with her ...

1155
01:15:02,839 --> 01:15:06,215
changed the name to the complainant
the first 3 weeks.

1156
01:15:06,216 --> 01:15:08,369
I'm not sure?

1157
01:16:30,856 --> 01:16:34,254
I really want to change this time,
Fr.

1158
01:16:34,255 --> 01:16:38,996
I'm so tired of
be wrong with my baby.

1159
01:16:38,997 --> 01:16:42,575
Want to be a good man, you know?

1160
01:16:42,576 --> 01:16:45,167
But I'm saying.

1161
01:16:45,168 --> 01:16:50,595
I can not leave it in the pants.
Even when I'm in church praying,

1162
01:16:50,596 --> 01:16:54,129
every time I see a girl
beautiful in the hall, I want ...

1163
01:16:54,130 --> 01:16:58,826
- I shove down her skirt.
- What do you do?

1164
01:17:00,637 --> 01:17:05,016
- Again I pray.
- Thank goodness that triumphs.

1165
01:17:05,017 --> 01:17:08,561
- How do you think I feel?
- What are you saying?

1166
01:17:08,562 --> 01:17:13,289
A row of women are
kneeling in front of me ...

1167
01:17:13,326 --> 01:17:16,778
open their mouths, put
tongue out,

1168
01:17:16,779 --> 01:17:20,632
look at me and say "Ah".

1169
01:17:21,951 --> 01:17:25,496
- What do you do?
- Again I pray.

1170
01:17:25,497 --> 01:17:29,250
It's sickening. How can you say that?
How can you think so?

1171
01:17:29,251 --> 01:17:34,630
These poor girls are looking for you
to have hope and you

1172
01:17:34,631 --> 01:17:39,831
want them to suck his dick.
Its fucking disgusting.

1173
01:17:39,832 --> 01:17:44,271
I'm just a man, Al
I have a chick under the cassock.

1174
01:17:45,727 --> 01:17:50,789
- You will burn in hell.
- I'm no better nor worse than you

1175
01:17:53,193 --> 01:17:57,591
You're weak. I hate weakness!

1176
01:18:04,830 --> 01:18:08,859
You disappoint me, man!

1177
01:18:13,005 --> 01:18:17,676
Stay away from children, okay?

1178
01:18:18,803 --> 01:18:20,929
- It's him!
- Come on, man?

1179
01:18:20,930 --> 01:18:23,015
Get him!

1180
01:18:23,016 --> 01:18:25,100
Put your hands behind your back!

1181
01:18:25,101 --> 01:18:27,383
- Fuck!
- What are you doing, Al!

1182
01:18:27,384 --> 01:18:28,905
Fuck you, asshole!

1183
01:18:29,565 --> 01:18:31,899
- Be quiet!
- Do not move!

1184
01:18:31,900 --> 01:18:36,034
You're under arrest for
Clancy O'harra murder.

1185
01:18:38,824 --> 01:18:41,016
Do not move!

1186
01:18:42,440 --> 01:18:45,167
- You're not going anywhere.
- Fuck!

1187
01:18:45,169 --> 01:18:48,081
It is a mistake!

1188
01:18:48,082 --> 01:18:50,605
Get off me!

1189
01:18:50,607 --> 01:18:54,682
- Fuck off.
- Get in there!

1190
01:18:55,332 --> 01:18:59,582
What is this attitude not
will get you nowhere.

1191
01:18:59,618 --> 01:19:01,225
Go fuck yourself!

1192
01:19:02,884 --> 01:19:04,627
Get in the car!

1193
01:19:06,781 --> 01:19:09,773
- Look at his head.
- Fuck!

1194
01:19:09,774 --> 01:19:15,409
He must have done something in life.
He lived in big trouble.

1195
01:19:15,445 --> 01:19:17,818
Then I thought:
"If you're ever in trouble,

1196
01:19:17,819 --> 01:19:20,232
then do something
let your mother proud. "

1197
01:19:20,233 --> 01:19:25,289
Rob a bank, a post
gasoline. Something worthwhile.

1198
01:19:25,290 --> 01:19:27,375
Want to meet?

1199
01:19:27,376 --> 01:19:29,861
So you have to do something
which obliges them to respect it.

1200
01:19:29,862 --> 01:19:33,214
No matter if you like.

1201
01:19:33,215 --> 01:19:37,424
If you fear. Then yes.

1202
01:19:37,425 --> 01:19:40,753
Turn headline. Am I right?

1203
01:19:46,020 --> 01:19:49,126
I do not believe that finally
got rid of him.

1204
01:19:50,984 --> 01:19:54,301
No one can
connect to it, right?

1205
01:19:56,198 --> 01:19:59,010
You are a danger, eh?

1206
01:19:59,284 --> 01:20:04,438
You know you like it.
Never thought you did.

1207
01:20:06,792 --> 01:20:10,419
There's nothing sexy
in being afraid.

1208
01:20:13,195 --> 01:20:15,268
God.

1209
01:20:16,195 --> 01:20:20,243
If you knew that you would know,
would have done anything to you first.

1210
01:20:21,182 --> 01:20:24,196
In sex, you are unique.

1211
01:20:30,567 --> 01:20:33,754
I'll find a way
to reward you.

1212
01:20:41,579 --> 01:20:46,330
Kat ... is a doll.

1213
01:20:46,331 --> 01:20:48,398
One of the first bitch.

1214
01:20:48,434 --> 01:20:50,993
And that's a compliment.

1215
01:20:51,030 --> 01:20:55,718
- Did not hear anything in the streets?
- I heard nothing.

1216
01:20:55,719 --> 01:21:00,139
I want to talk to the mother of Clancy
and find out who was behind him.

1217
01:21:00,140 --> 01:21:02,976
Reilly does not know anything?

1218
01:21:02,977 --> 01:21:08,794
Why not go talk to him
in line, gotta get out of here now.

1219
01:21:09,358 --> 01:21:12,069
Why worry?
They have no evidence.

1220
01:21:12,070 --> 01:21:15,614
My digital
are in the gun, right?

1221
01:21:15,615 --> 01:21:20,119
- How?
- I do not know.

1222
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:22,955
My lawyer says
the good thing is that ...

1223
01:21:22,956 --> 01:21:25,666
I have evidence that was not close
Clancy's house that night.

1224
01:21:25,667 --> 01:21:28,044
I was with you.

1225
01:21:28,045 --> 01:21:31,179
But I do not understand why the guy
who lives downstairs ...

1226
01:21:31,180 --> 01:21:33,657
said he saw me leave
running from the building ...

1227
01:21:33,658 --> 01:21:35,892
shortly after 22:45
hearing the shot.

1228
01:21:35,893 --> 01:21:39,378
He said he knows that I was by
he saw my jacket Big Al

1229
01:21:39,379 --> 01:21:41,730
But I lost that shit
jacket weeks ago.

1230
01:21:41,731 --> 01:21:43,143
Anyone could
be using it.

1231
01:21:43,144 --> 01:21:44,744
I do not understand, understand?

1232
01:21:44,745 --> 01:21:46,876
Clancy was dead
I sold the gun?

1233
01:21:46,877 --> 01:21:48,637
No.

1234
01:21:48,674 --> 01:21:54,071
He was killed with 45 to
is registered in my name.

1235
01:21:54,072 --> 01:21:59,662
- I do not understand.
- Someone is up to me.

1236
01:21:59,663 --> 01:22:02,695
- Who?
- I do not know.

1237
01:22:02,731 --> 01:22:06,856
Someone who knows us.

1238
01:22:06,919 --> 01:22:11,048
- Are you accusing me?
- No. .. I do not know.

1239
01:22:11,049 --> 01:22:14,321
How do I know.
What the fuck am I saying?

1240
01:22:14,322 --> 01:22:16,402
The good thing is that you are my proof.

1241
01:22:16,403 --> 01:22:18,931
- You're my alibi.
- What proof, Al?

1242
01:22:18,932 --> 01:22:21,600
- Where were you tonight?
- How so?

1243
01:22:21,601 --> 01:22:26,083
- Where were you tonight?
- I was with you.

1244
01:22:27,316 --> 01:22:30,526
We were playing at home
deck and watching TV, remember?

1245
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:33,321
You do not want to leave that night,
back after the movie.

1246
01:22:33,322 --> 01:22:37,059
I made baked beans with
toast and tuna for me.

1247
01:22:38,647 --> 01:22:40,311
What?

1248
01:22:40,371 --> 01:22:43,256
I do not remember.

1249
01:22:43,374 --> 01:22:49,552
Do not play games with me.
You're my alibi.

1250
01:22:49,881 --> 01:22:52,883
I'm doing
confusion about the date.

1251
01:22:52,884 --> 01:22:58,934
- I was with you.
- No. I was with a friend.

1252
01:22:59,225 --> 01:23:05,462
And he would swear on a stack that
Bibles. He is very religious.

1253
01:23:05,606 --> 01:23:10,218
- You would not do this to me, Kat.
- Want to bet?

1254
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:15,762
- Want to bet?
- Not too late for us.

1255
01:23:16,159 --> 01:23:22,370
- Please ...
- Do not beg.

1256
01:23:22,406 --> 01:23:26,672
Your ...

1257
01:23:26,673 --> 01:23:28,666
asshole.

1258
01:23:28,703 --> 01:23:32,513
I'll kill you,
fucking bitch!

1259
01:23:32,514 --> 01:23:38,338
- Sit down!
- You will not regret it!

1260
01:23:38,391 --> 01:23:43,479
Listen, for now
I'm in control.

1261
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:46,312
And he knows how:

1262
01:23:46,834 --> 01:23:52,478
hips, lips, teats.

1263
01:23:52,514 --> 01:23:55,332
Complete woman.

1264
01:23:56,285 --> 01:24:01,941
What are you talking about?
Who you been talking?

1265
01:24:01,957 --> 01:24:04,508
- I want to hear, Al
- I'll kill you.

1266
01:24:04,509 --> 01:24:07,528
- Listen well.
- I'll kill you!

1267
01:24:08,089 --> 01:24:12,331
You're leaving me with much
anger and you do not want that ...

1268
01:24:12,367 --> 01:24:18,157
because I have power.

1269
01:24:18,193 --> 01:24:23,643
You will rot here
asshole.

1270
01:24:23,644 --> 01:24:25,815
If I want to.

1271
01:24:25,816 --> 01:24:28,776
You understand me, Al?

1272
01:24:28,777 --> 01:24:32,822
You set me up.

1273
01:24:32,823 --> 01:24:36,243
- Do not be so dramatic.
- It was the Vic.

1274
01:24:36,244 --> 01:24:40,760
It was Vic, right?

1275
01:24:40,761 --> 01:24:44,655
Wrong.

1276
01:24:45,253 --> 01:24:49,825
It was not Reilly. He does not ...

1277
01:24:49,826 --> 01:24:52,975
Say it is not climbed with him, okay?

1278
01:24:53,011 --> 01:24:58,391
Tell him he did not ask for
you suck his dick!

1279
01:24:58,392 --> 01:25:00,920
He did not need to ask.

1280
01:25:03,248 --> 01:25:05,458
I offered.

1281
01:25:07,402 --> 01:25:10,529
- Oh, Kat.
- Only ...

1282
01:25:10,530 --> 01:25:14,156
Thanks for the haircut.

1283
01:25:14,951 --> 01:25:17,457
I turned someone else.

1284
01:25:17,494 --> 01:25:19,872
- So how did?
- What?

1285
01:25:19,873 --> 01:25:23,543
- As armed pro Al?
- There have laid.

1286
01:25:23,544 --> 01:25:27,422
Snap out of it.
I know it was you with Kat.

1287
01:25:27,423 --> 01:25:29,310
Not me.

1288
01:25:31,761 --> 01:25:37,599
- He slept with her recently?
- No, and you?

1289
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:41,500
- No.
- Bitch.

1290
01:25:41,771 --> 01:25:47,214
- But you still want it too, right?
- To tell the truth ...

1291
01:25:47,444 --> 01:25:48,950
It is too much trouble.

1292
01:25:48,951 --> 01:25:52,319
After all this,
I can never trust her.

1293
01:25:52,950 --> 01:25:55,290
I would be suspicious
all the time.

1294
01:25:56,613 --> 01:25:58,759
It scares me.

1295
01:26:00,917 --> 01:26:03,645
He preferred to sleep with
somebody more like you.

1296
01:26:03,647 --> 01:26:05,707
Really?

1297
01:26:05,744 --> 01:26:07,424
Yes

1298
01:26:08,550 --> 01:26:12,803
I never speak much with a woman
without ending up going to bed.

1299
01:26:12,804 --> 01:26:14,443
You know?

1300
01:26:14,444 --> 01:26:18,124
If you're lucky, you might have
many firsts with me.

1301
01:26:19,102 --> 01:26:23,231
- This is not a game?
- I'm not with games.

1302
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:28,378
- Play pool.
- It would be a new approach.

1303
01:26:29,530 --> 01:26:35,257
Become friends
first and then climb.

1304
01:26:38,832 --> 01:26:42,376
- Your legs are great, Vic.
- You like it?

1305
01:26:42,377 --> 01:26:44,925
Taste.

1306
01:26:45,552 --> 01:26:47,495
Really.

1307
01:26:47,549 --> 01:26:51,469
If you play right can be
back to you within 10 minutes.

1308
01:26:51,470 --> 01:26:55,288
- What should I do?
- Shut up.

1309
01:26:55,324 --> 01:26:57,298
I am speechless.

1310
01:27:10,949 --> 01:27:14,724
- What was that?
- What?

1311
01:27:15,787 --> 01:27:20,641
You have not cured me.
I am not sick.

1312
01:27:22,127 --> 01:27:26,464
Whenever I play in two teams,
and I'ma sucker for redheads.

1313
01:27:26,465 --> 01:27:28,731
Me too.

1314
01:27:40,021 --> 01:27:45,215
- How was it?
- It was good.

1315
01:27:46,236 --> 01:27:49,989
- Let's get outta here.
- Ok

1316
01:28:09,507 --> 01:28:13,346
Then we can get your stuff?

1317
01:28:13,383 --> 01:28:17,627
- And take me home?
- No.

1318
01:28:18,771 --> 01:28:22,690
No? How so?

1319
01:28:22,691 --> 01:28:24,956
No.

1320
01:28:26,612 --> 01:28:31,573
I thought that with Al out of the game
'd stay together.

1321
01:28:31,609 --> 01:28:33,099
I said that?

1322
01:28:33,833 --> 01:28:36,993
It was not necessary.
Your body has expressed it.

1323
01:28:40,126 --> 01:28:43,911
Whipped.

1324
01:28:43,912 --> 01:28:47,844
You got what you wanted and
now is getting rid of me.

1325
01:28:47,881 --> 01:28:52,509
- So, it will be Vic and Reilly?
- Not so, ok?

1326
01:28:52,510 --> 01:28:57,630
Neither.
I need to be alone. Understand?

1327
01:28:59,105 --> 01:29:04,168
So, after all
I've done for you ...

1328
01:29:06,154 --> 01:29:10,074
- The reward is just a kiss?
- What happened to you?

1329
01:29:10,075 --> 01:29:14,161
And that fucking hips, tits,
lips, woman? Power.

1330
01:29:14,162 --> 01:29:16,527
- Use.
- Stop!

1331
01:29:16,564 --> 01:29:21,225
Do not throw my words
in my face! You used me!

1332
01:29:21,337 --> 01:29:23,880
I did not take anything from you, ok?

1333
01:29:23,881 --> 01:29:26,675
He said I could trust you.
That does not need anything from me.

1334
01:29:26,676 --> 01:29:29,428
And in the end, treated me as
others. Right?

1335
01:29:29,429 --> 01:29:33,348
You got what
wanted to take away from me.

1336
01:29:33,349 --> 01:29:36,542
So do not be a victim.

1337
01:29:40,148 --> 01:29:42,297
Fuck!

1338
01:29:42,939 --> 01:29:44,793
Fuck!

1339
01:29:44,794 --> 01:29:48,677
Can not play
people out like that!

1340
01:30:05,675 --> 01:30:08,570
What's happening
with ketchup?

1341
01:30:16,812 --> 01:30:20,982
Big Al Pacas climbed well.
He was great.

1342
01:30:20,983 --> 01:30:23,943
Until you stop being.
Do not get me wrong,

1343
01:30:23,945 --> 01:30:27,927
when we started out,
was exciting, dangerous.

1344
01:30:27,928 --> 01:30:33,117
He was funny, sexy, high.
It made me feel safe. Protected.

1345
01:30:33,455 --> 01:30:36,624
But he could not me
protect yourself.

1346
01:30:36,625 --> 01:30:42,009
Big Al could give me almost everything in
world, but "almost" was not enough.

1347
01:30:42,381 --> 01:30:48,079
Life is like sex. If you want
exit right, do it yourself.

1348
01:30:50,014 --> 01:30:51,570
Hang out with Big Al ..

1349
01:30:52,301 --> 01:30:56,393
made me realize that
best feeling in the world ...

1350
01:30:56,854 --> 01:31:00,505
is taking care of number one here.

1351
01:31:00,650 --> 01:31:03,384
Myself.

1352
01:31:04,384 --> 01:31:14,384
