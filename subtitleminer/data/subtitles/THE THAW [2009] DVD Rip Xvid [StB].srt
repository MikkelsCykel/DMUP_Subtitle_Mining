My name is David Kruipen.

2
00:00:33,232 --> 00:00:35,465
"What is sacrifice?

3
00:00:35,888 --> 00:00:39,905
What does it mean
to make a real difference?

4
00:00:40,233 --> 00:00:44,160
Throughout my life and career,
I have straddled two worlds.

5
00:00:44,488 --> 00:00:47,097
Increasingly I have become...

6
00:00:47,136 --> 00:00:48,640
...respected.

7
00:00:48,968 --> 00:00:53,047
Increasingly my books and
articles are published and read.

8
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:57,057
Increasingly I have been
embraced by policymakers...

9
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:59,130
...and referenced by bureaucrats...

10
00:00:59,169 --> 00:01:01,097
...but today I realized...

11
00:01:01,233 --> 00:01:03,505
...that I have...

12
00:01:03,545 --> 00:01:06,274
...misguided myself.

13
00:01:06,986 --> 00:01:09,257
Today I rediscovered...

14
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,388
...what I knew
when I was..

15
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:13,398
Young.

16
00:01:20,649 --> 00:01:22,193
- Is that one on her forehead?
- I can't look.

17
00:01:22,425 --> 00:01:24,291
Jesus Christ!

18
00:01:25,097 --> 00:01:26,490
I know.

19
00:01:26,529 --> 00:01:28,025
You said it was a tick.

20
00:01:28,065 --> 00:01:30,427
- Um, I don't know if it was a tick.
- It's not a tick.

21
00:01:30,466 --> 00:01:31,786
- It was a bug.
- It hurts.

22
00:01:31,827 --> 00:01:34,298
I know, sweetheart,
but I need you to stay still.

23
00:01:34,338 --> 00:01:37,209
Okay, it's just about there.
Hold on, hold on.Hold on.

24
00:01:38,112 --> 00:01:39,706
Okay okay.

25
00:01:40,706 --> 00:01:42,090
Okay, there, Doug,
do you see that?

26
00:01:42,131 --> 00:01:43,283
- Jesus.
- What?

27
00:01:43,323 --> 00:01:45,274
- See those hairs?
- Get the tweezers, the tweezers.

28
00:01:45,315 --> 00:01:47,939
I want you to grab it. Honey,
keep your head still, please.

29
00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:50,122
- Get back in so I can see it.
- What?

30
00:01:50,162 --> 00:01:52,170
Get... Just...

31
00:01:52,786 --> 00:01:53,803
Shit.

32
00:01:54,131 --> 00:01:55,730
What do I do?
What do I do?

33
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:57,555
We have to do something
about the population.

34
00:01:57,595 --> 00:02:00,419
- And what is wrong with the population?
- We have too many people.

35
00:02:00,651 --> 00:02:02,787
There's way too many people
using way too much stuff.

36
00:02:02,827 --> 00:02:04,299
That's why we have
global warming.

37
00:02:04,338 --> 00:02:07,123
They will tell you
that we are on the verge...

38
00:02:07,162 --> 00:02:10,155
...of imminent destruction.
The carbon dioxide in the air...

39
00:02:10,194 --> 00:02:13,107
...is gonna turn our atmosphere
into a microwave...

40
00:02:13,146 --> 00:02:15,250
...and we're all gonna burn and die.

41
00:02:15,674 --> 00:02:18,268
What a load of crap.

42
00:02:19,131 --> 00:02:20,628
I don't care what they say.

43
00:02:20,668 --> 00:02:22,955
It's not a glacial meltdown
or anything like that.

44
00:02:22,996 --> 00:02:25,202
For decades
we've been warned.

45
00:02:25,243 --> 00:02:27,820
Global warming is definitely real
and it's potentially catastrophic.

46
00:02:27,859 --> 00:02:30,179
I believe it's prophecy
being fulfilled...

47
00:02:30,219 --> 00:02:32,164
...hard times that's spoken
about in the Bible.

48
00:02:32,299 --> 00:02:35,131
Global warming is
becoming a religion...

49
00:02:35,171 --> 00:02:36,964
...for some of these...
for some of these loonies.

50
00:02:37,004 --> 00:02:40,628
Of course there's global warming
and of course it's man-made.

51
00:02:40,764 --> 00:02:42,261
It's a hoax.

52
00:02:42,877 --> 00:02:45,700
The melting Arctic will
reveal a frightening truth.

53
00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:48,620
I don't think that people are
going to do enough in time.

54
00:02:48,853 --> 00:02:51,884
We're on the brink of Armageddon.
Most of us will die.

55
00:02:52,212 --> 00:02:53,916
The few of us who survive will be...

56
00:02:53,957 --> 00:02:56,491
...living in a world like Somalia.

57
00:02:57,011 --> 00:02:59,292
And what can we do about it?

58
00:02:59,332 --> 00:03:02,772
make small sacrifices,
but the real ones that really matter...

59
00:03:02,811 --> 00:03:04,844
- The world will change, I don't think.
- Ever.

60
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:07,636
What does it mean to make
a real difference?

61
00:03:07,677 --> 00:03:11,692
...radical environmentalists are
clearly a legitimate terrorist threat.

62
00:03:11,732 --> 00:03:13,885
When non-violent
methods fail to...

63
00:03:13,924 --> 00:03:15,430
...change people's minds
quickly enough...

64
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,822
...well, we have to consider
other options.

65
00:03:17,957 --> 00:03:20,876
- The time is now.
- We have a breaking story.

66
00:03:21,012 --> 00:03:23,653
It's spreading quickly
and hospitals cannot keep up.

67
00:03:23,693 --> 00:03:26,637
Thousands are violently ill,
hundreds dead.

68
00:03:26,677 --> 00:03:29,069
There is complete chaos
in the streets.

69
00:03:29,204 --> 00:03:32,541
400 people have died.
At least 10,000 are infected.

70
00:03:32,581 --> 00:03:36,149
State troopers and the National Guard
were ordered to seal off all borders...

71
00:03:36,189 --> 00:03:38,160
...as people
are trying to flee.

72
00:03:40,405 --> 00:03:44,135
-When nature is the terrorist...

73
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:52,782
We're gonna... we're gonna die.

74
00:03:52,822 --> 00:03:54,638
It's too late to do anything.

75
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:57,118
I'm gonna die,
I'm gonna die!

76
00:03:57,351 --> 00:03:59,214
I'm gonna... Help me!

77
00:03:59,787 --> 00:04:00,842
-One...

78
00:04:01,656 --> 00:04:03,146
of the Horrors...

79
00:04:03,278 --> 00:04:06,158
-The worst bioterrorism
we've ever known.-

80
00:04:06,486 --> 00:04:08,120
Oh my God!

81
00:04:10,175 --> 00:04:12,112
Help me!

82
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:25,430
Banks island Canada arctic
Late spring.

83
00:05:22,521 --> 00:05:25,001
David!

84
00:06:01,466 --> 00:06:04,137
A hundred pounds
underweight.

85
00:06:04,178 --> 00:06:05,945
He must have traveled far.

86
00:06:05,986 --> 00:06:09,092
The teeth... only two years old.

87
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:13,338
He probably tried to swim...

88
00:06:13,377 --> 00:06:15,866
...off island, had to come back.

89
00:06:15,906 --> 00:06:18,211
Not enough ice.

90
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,707
What's he saying?

91
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:28,923
He's saying get
the fuck over here.

92
00:06:29,826 --> 00:06:32,796
What did you find, man?

93
00:06:34,658 --> 00:06:37,538
What is it?

94
00:06:37,961 --> 00:06:39,986
Manalu.

95
00:06:48,858 --> 00:06:50,667
Pine beetle is
just one example...

96
00:06:50,707 --> 00:06:54,563
...of the profound impact
global warming is having on the planet.

97
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:58,123
Truth is our way of life
is leaving the door open...

98
00:06:58,163 --> 00:06:59,755
...to an infinite number of threats...

99
00:06:59,795 --> 00:07:02,963
...equally as pernicious
as the tiny pine beetle.

100
00:07:03,003 --> 00:07:06,251
We're not going to see an end
to this sort of horror...

101
00:07:06,387 --> 00:07:08,915
...unless sacrifices are made.

102
00:07:09,531 --> 00:07:11,636
And that's all for now.

103
00:07:11,963 --> 00:07:14,252
Now as you know, a few
of you will have the honor...

104
00:07:14,292 --> 00:07:17,012
...of joining the renown
Dr. Kruipen and his team...

105
00:07:17,052 --> 00:07:19,180
...studying the impact
of global warming...

106
00:07:19,219 --> 00:07:21,259
...on polar bears.

107
00:07:21,299 --> 00:07:23,748
Adam Galen...

108
00:07:23,788 --> 00:07:25,804
Frederico Fulce...

109
00:07:25,844 --> 00:07:28,062
...and Ling Chen.

110
00:07:32,924 --> 00:07:34,229
- Yes, Adam?

111
00:07:34,286 --> 00:07:36,588
- I thought there were four
students going on to the trip.

112
00:07:36,763 --> 00:07:41,262
So did I. Unfortunately
that is no longer the case.

113
00:07:44,949 --> 00:07:47,165
Jesus Christ!

114
00:07:47,396 --> 00:07:49,236
You know, we probably would
have been there by now...

115
00:07:49,276 --> 00:07:53,159
...if you guys didn't have to, like,
put on four different bathing suits.

116
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,868
I asked you
to please not call me.

117
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:02,140
Evelyn, don't hang up.
It's important.

118
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:04,589
We discovered something.
I want you to come up.

119
00:08:04,821 --> 00:08:06,765
I told you I'm not ready
to see you.

120
00:08:06,804 --> 00:08:08,877
Can we please
just leave it at that?

121
00:08:08,917 --> 00:08:11,037
Ev, I just...

122
00:08:11,077 --> 00:08:13,750
I want you to understand.

123
00:08:13,789 --> 00:08:15,845
You want me to understand.

124
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:19,199
That you couldn't even
make it to her funeral.

125
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:22,610
Evelyn, this is important.

126
00:08:23,309 --> 00:08:25,966
It's important to our cause.

127
00:08:26,101 --> 00:08:28,701
Look, Dad, it's not my cause.

128
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:30,901
It's your cause.
You're the one who chose...

129
00:08:30,941 --> 00:08:33,645
Okay, so apparently people just get out
of vehicles when they're moving.

130
00:08:33,685 --> 00:08:36,941
Everybody knows about
global warming,Congratulations.

131
00:08:36,981 --> 00:08:39,182
It just really too bad
nobody really gives a shit.

132
00:08:39,701 --> 00:08:42,182
Ev, I'll...

133
00:08:42,346 --> 00:08:46,235
...give you all
of your Mother's money.

134
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:50,542
- No more monthly payments?
- That's right.

135
00:08:50,774 --> 00:08:53,342
There are some students
coming up from Dawson...

136
00:08:53,381 --> 00:08:56,126
I'll save you a seat.

137
00:08:56,166 --> 00:09:00,679
Hey, Evy, get in the car!

138
00:09:01,662 --> 00:09:03,734
Uh, I'll... I don't know.
I'll think about it.

139
00:09:03,774 --> 00:09:05,991
- Get in the car!
- Dad, look, I have to go.

140
00:09:06,222 --> 00:09:07,568
I'll think about it.

141
00:09:07,683 --> 00:09:09,313
Could you hold on a minute?
- We're moving.

142
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,990
Calm down.

143
00:09:13,927 --> 00:09:15,615
How can I communicate
with the world...

144
00:09:15,654 --> 00:09:18,215
...when I can't even communicate
with my own daughter?

145
00:09:18,255 --> 00:09:20,859
She's just angry right now.
She'll come around.

146
00:09:25,084 --> 00:09:27,004
What?

147
00:09:59,872 --> 00:10:03,114
Eight hours from bottle
to throttle, buddy.

148
00:10:04,016 --> 00:10:05,952
Are you good?

149
00:10:06,184 --> 00:10:08,136
Yeah, I'm good.

150
00:10:08,271 --> 00:10:10,328
Someone named Ling called.

151
00:10:10,368 --> 00:10:12,945
- Said she was running late.
- Thanks.

152
00:10:12,985 --> 00:10:14,515
Sounded cute.

153
00:10:21,865 --> 00:10:23,385
Hello?

154
00:10:23,424 --> 00:10:25,440
Bart, I need your help.

155
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,929
Dr. Kruipen?

156
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:30,905
I can't reach Evy.
She can't come up.

157
00:10:30,944 --> 00:10:33,232
Why?
Is everything okay?

158
00:10:33,273 --> 00:10:34,976
Yes, everything's fine,Just...

159
00:10:35,016 --> 00:10:37,930
make sure she
doesn't come up.

160
00:10:38,572 --> 00:10:39,531
Okay.

161
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,713
Tell her that i'll send the
paperwork back with you.

162
00:10:43,424 --> 00:10:45,944
Sure,Listen...

163
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,891
Did you reach Bart?

164
00:11:20,314 --> 00:11:22,722
David, did you
tell them not to come?

165
00:11:22,857 --> 00:11:24,906
To call for help?

166
00:11:24,946 --> 00:11:29,345
- Yes, I did.
- Thank God.

167
00:11:32,027 --> 00:11:33,986
Nuti is...

168
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,979
...he's much worse.

169
00:11:37,307 --> 00:11:40,667
And I'm...

170
00:11:41,114 --> 00:11:45,147
I'm not much better.

171
00:12:04,467 --> 00:12:06,612
- Hey, nice chopper.
- Hey,Thanks.

172
00:12:06,652 --> 00:12:08,955
- Where are you from?
- Dawson City.

173
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:13,133
- Where are you from originally?
- Dawson City.

174
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:20,027
One of you gentlemen want
to help her with her bags there?

175
00:12:20,067 --> 00:12:22,548
Yeah. Here, let me
take that for you.

176
00:12:22,589 --> 00:12:24,989
No thanks.

177
00:12:26,116 --> 00:12:28,268
- Oh, hey, let me get that.
- Oh, thank you.

178
00:12:28,307 --> 00:12:29,508
Thanks.

179
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:31,348
- Can I ride in the front?
- Yeah.

180
00:12:31,388 --> 00:12:32,651
There you go.
Hop in.

181
00:12:32,691 --> 00:12:35,100
Thanks.

182
00:12:37,741 --> 00:12:39,540
Oh, shit.

183
00:12:39,772 --> 00:12:43,511
Uh, just put your stuff
in the back there, guys.

184
00:12:49,188 --> 00:12:50,589
- Evy.
- Hey, Bart.

185
00:12:50,628 --> 00:12:53,629
Well... shoot.

186
00:12:53,668 --> 00:12:55,557
You weren't supposed
to come up.

187
00:12:55,597 --> 00:12:57,308
- What?
- That's what he said.

188
00:12:57,348 --> 00:12:59,549
I was supposed to give you some
sort of paperwork when I got back.

189
00:12:59,589 --> 00:13:01,949
So he doesn't even
want me to come up there?

190
00:13:02,373 --> 00:13:05,925
I'm sure he's got his reasons.

191
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:09,989
You know what? I don't really
care what he says. I'm coming.

192
00:13:10,029 --> 00:13:12,028
Uh... Uh... Evy?

193
00:13:12,069 --> 00:13:14,110
Listen...

194
00:13:14,149 --> 00:13:16,373
...that's going to put me
in a really tight spot, see- 'cause...

195
00:13:16,413 --> 00:13:18,206
Sorry, Bart.

196
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:22,998
Yeah, you see, I kinda...
I promised him...

197
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:26,109
Okay.

198
00:13:37,509 --> 00:13:40,317
Ground Control, this is Major Tom.
We're outta here, man.

199
00:13:40,454 --> 00:13:45,624
This is Ground Control.
You're cleared for takeoff.

200
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:05,887
Did I hear that you're
David Kruipen's daughter?

201
00:14:06,215 --> 00:14:08,119
Yeah.

202
00:14:08,351 --> 00:14:11,911
No way. That...
it must be so cool.

203
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:14,230
Yeah, he's my hero.

204
00:14:14,654 --> 00:14:16,670
Is it true that
when he was younger...

205
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,623
...he sabotaged a pipeline
that was blocking...

206
00:14:18,663 --> 00:14:21,040
- Migratory caribou?
- I guess so, yeah.

207
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:25,311
Huh, sure has changed.

208
00:14:38,952 --> 00:14:43,551
It's okay, buddy.
It's okay.

209
00:14:55,631 --> 00:14:57,551
I'll wrap him in plastic...

210
00:14:57,592 --> 00:14:59,352
...just in case.

211
00:14:59,392 --> 00:15:01,912
Make sure it's sealed.

212
00:15:01,951 --> 00:15:03,816
We need to protect ourselves...

213
00:15:03,855 --> 00:15:07,872
...until we're ready.

214
00:15:20,905 --> 00:15:23,873
Are you okay?

215
00:15:24,801 --> 00:15:27,193
No.

216
00:15:29,433 --> 00:15:32,793
Ready for what?

217
00:15:33,273 --> 00:15:37,392
Edward, ready for what?

218
00:15:54,522 --> 00:15:58,273
Look at that ice.

219
00:15:59,353 --> 00:16:01,913
Yeah, she's breaking up
more and more every year.

220
00:16:01,953 --> 00:16:05,073
It's terrible.
When are we gonna wake up?

221
00:16:05,113 --> 00:16:10,737
It's not that easy, buddy, not when
people's lifestyles are at stake.

222
00:16:10,777 --> 00:16:12,995
What are you
implying, Frederico?

223
00:16:13,034 --> 00:16:16,554
I'm just saying that we can't ignore
the reality of what we're up against.

224
00:16:16,594 --> 00:16:19,113
Somebody's got
to take responsibility.

225
00:16:19,154 --> 00:16:22,113
Okay, sure, but what are we
really doing to stop it?

226
00:16:22,154 --> 00:16:23,754
I mean really stop it?

227
00:16:23,795 --> 00:16:27,675
Look at Kruipen. He's attacking
the problem from the inside out...

228
00:16:27,714 --> 00:16:30,675
- Changing how people think.
- What if we don't have that much time?

229
00:16:30,715 --> 00:16:33,595
Maybe the best way to change
how people think is to...

230
00:16:33,634 --> 00:16:35,914
...blow something up,
you know?

231
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:39,300
Look at that ice down there.
That's melting fast.

232
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:41,859
What do you think?

233
00:16:42,475 --> 00:16:46,315
Oh... You don't want to know
what I think.

234
00:16:46,451 --> 00:16:49,411
Sure we do.

235
00:16:49,995 --> 00:16:53,635
Honestly, I think that people
are incapable of change...

236
00:16:53,675 --> 00:16:57,892
...and our days are numbered. Might as well
enjoy the place while we can.

237
00:16:57,932 --> 00:17:01,675
See? That's exactly
what I'm talking about.

238
00:17:01,715 --> 00:17:06,708
Nobody's willing to make
any sacrifices.

239
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:12,476
There she blows.

240
00:17:44,284 --> 00:17:46,597
There's no power.

241
00:17:46,637 --> 00:17:49,397
What is that smell?

242
00:17:49,724 --> 00:17:53,758
Smells like something
died in here.

243
00:17:59,942 --> 00:18:01,814
Hello!

244
00:18:02,141 --> 00:18:04,797
Dr. Kruipen?
Edward?

245
00:18:04,837 --> 00:18:06,861
Why is there no heat?

246
00:18:06,902 --> 00:18:08,845
Yeah, wouldn't the pipes
freeze at night?

247
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:11,636
They must be
out in the field.

248
00:18:11,677 --> 00:18:14,598
There's no running water either.

249
00:18:15,117 --> 00:18:17,486
The genny must be off.

250
00:18:17,525 --> 00:18:21,935
I'm gonna go check it out,
okay? All right.

251
00:18:24,654 --> 00:18:26,957
Hey, where you going?

252
00:18:27,093 --> 00:18:30,207
The restroom.
Is that okay with you?

253
00:18:32,549 --> 00:18:34,558
Well, now we know why
one of us got bumped.

254
00:18:34,598 --> 00:18:38,170
Yeah, and she doesn't even
sound like she wants to be here.

255
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:10,248
Shoot.

256
00:19:15,567 --> 00:19:17,519
Did you want a water?

257
00:19:17,655 --> 00:19:20,152
No thanks.

258
00:19:21,879 --> 00:19:25,432
I'm gonna go look around.

259
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:33,239
Ling...

260
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:37,144
...look, I know I can never
expect you to trust me again.

261
00:19:37,184 --> 00:19:41,128
I made a huge mistake.

262
00:19:43,392 --> 00:19:47,088
You are so full of shit.

263
00:19:47,321 --> 00:19:48,968
What, a little makeup sex
in the Arctic?

264
00:19:49,008 --> 00:19:50,671
Something to tell
your buddies about.

265
00:19:50,712 --> 00:19:51,761
You know it's not like that.

266
00:19:51,896 --> 00:19:54,198
Oh, really?Well, then...

267
00:19:54,487 --> 00:19:55,985
why tell me this now?

268
00:19:56,025 --> 00:20:00,833
I don't know.
You were so angry.

269
00:20:01,072 --> 00:20:04,921
And I was scared.

270
00:20:27,921 --> 00:20:30,521
Evelyn?

271
00:21:18,266 --> 00:21:22,098
I'm looking for something
that belongs to me.

272
00:21:22,426 --> 00:21:25,203
You don't really believe what
you said in the helicopter, do you?

273
00:21:25,722 --> 00:21:27,755
What did I say?

274
00:21:27,795 --> 00:21:29,835
About just giving up.

275
00:21:30,451 --> 00:21:34,683
Bet your dad
doesn't think that.

276
00:21:37,803 --> 00:21:41,508
You'd probably know what
he thinks better than I do.

277
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:46,363
My dad's in the oil business.

278
00:21:46,402 --> 00:21:49,123
A few years ago,
one of his rigs hit sour gas...

279
00:21:49,163 --> 00:21:50,868
...and the well blew out.

280
00:21:50,907 --> 00:21:54,083
The gas blew downwind
and killed nine people.

281
00:21:54,124 --> 00:21:59,276
I asked him how he could live
with himself and you know what he said?

282
00:21:59,412 --> 00:22:01,524
"Plenty more
where they came from. "

283
00:22:01,563 --> 00:22:04,453
Just part of the risk.

284
00:22:09,634 --> 00:22:13,108
So now you know why
I'm willing to blow shit up.

285
00:22:13,148 --> 00:22:16,683
You don't really think that
ecoterrorism is the answer.

286
00:22:16,724 --> 00:22:19,692
I don't know.

287
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:25,481
But I want to do what needs to be done,
be there when the ball starts rolling.

288
00:22:30,021 --> 00:22:35,322
There's a flashlight in the lab. We'll
need it if the genny doesn't start.

289
00:22:41,938 --> 00:22:43,281
GunShot.

290
00:23:03,486 --> 00:23:05,885
Pheeww.

291
00:23:06,246 --> 00:23:08,326
- Man.
- Ugh.

292
00:23:08,654 --> 00:23:11,742
Oh, that is brutal.

293
00:23:13,422 --> 00:23:15,933
God, it stinks.

294
00:23:16,165 --> 00:23:18,359
What the hell is that?

295
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:21,086
I don't know.

296
00:23:21,126 --> 00:23:25,725
Hold on.
Don't get so close.

297
00:23:26,005 --> 00:23:29,286
Oh my God!
Oh, shit, are you okay?

298
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:32,287
Yeah, it's okay.

299
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:40,382
Hello?

300
00:23:40,423 --> 00:23:44,167
Yeah, we're in here.

301
00:23:46,439 --> 00:23:49,022
Oh, Jeez Louise!

302
00:23:49,446 --> 00:23:52,406
Not exactly my choice
of words, but...

303
00:23:52,446 --> 00:23:53,887
...yeah.

304
00:23:54,502 --> 00:23:57,191
Why do they have this
rotting bear in here?

305
00:23:57,327 --> 00:24:01,353
- Oh.
- I don't know, but I need a picture.

306
00:24:09,069 --> 00:24:10,952
Something just bit me.

307
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:13,104
What?

308
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,880
I think it's just a flea bite.
You're gonna make it.

309
00:24:21,687 --> 00:24:23,611
Let's get out of here.
The stink is getting to me.

310
00:24:26,912 --> 00:24:29,873
Evelyn, hold up.

311
00:24:33,392 --> 00:24:35,120
I heard a gunshot.

312
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,840
What?

313
00:24:36,881 --> 00:24:39,968
From out in the field
when I was filling up the genny.

314
00:24:40,008 --> 00:24:42,208
Look, I'm sure it's nothing.

315
00:24:42,248 --> 00:24:45,008
I just thought
you should know.

316
00:24:45,527 --> 00:24:48,486
- Okay.
- Thanks.

317
00:25:11,601 --> 00:25:15,226
My name is David Kruipen.

318
00:25:15,746 --> 00:25:19,969
"What is sacrifice?"

319
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:41,570
Base station
to field station, come in.

320
00:25:42,522 --> 00:25:46,346
Base station to field station.

321
00:25:46,483 --> 00:25:48,450
Dad?

322
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:52,226
Dad, are you out there?

323
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,570
Evelyn?

324
00:25:59,409 --> 00:26:03,130
Jane, could you please
put my dad on?

325
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:07,403
What are you doing here?
You're not supposed to be here.

326
00:26:07,443 --> 00:26:10,451
I don't want to discuss this with you.
Could you please put my dad on.

327
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:14,410
Evelyn, are the students
with you?

328
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:19,540
Yes, of course they're here.
Why wouldn't they be?

329
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:26,179
Jane, could you please
put my father on.

330
00:26:26,507 --> 00:26:29,211
David!

331
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:32,891
They're here!
The students are here.

332
00:26:32,931 --> 00:26:35,411
David! Evelyn's here.

333
00:26:35,642 --> 00:26:37,572
She's on the radio.

334
00:26:37,611 --> 00:26:40,531
She's at the base station.

335
00:26:40,572 --> 00:26:42,811
What's going on, David?

336
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:47,132
Evelyn, what are you
doing here?

337
00:26:47,172 --> 00:26:49,812
- So now you don't even want to see me?
- I do.

338
00:26:49,851 --> 00:26:53,220
It's just... it's very important
that you stay where you are.

339
00:26:53,259 --> 00:26:54,860
Where are you?
Everybody's waiting.

340
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,892
Please do what I'm saying,
just this once.

341
00:26:57,931 --> 00:27:02,092
- What's going on?
- Just do what I'm asking you do this one time.

342
00:27:02,132 --> 00:27:03,492
Okay?

343
00:27:03,819 --> 00:27:05,940
Please.

344
00:27:07,372 --> 00:27:10,332
Okay. Fine.

345
00:27:11,372 --> 00:27:13,221
Good.

346
00:27:13,357 --> 00:27:16,061
Why are they here?

347
00:27:16,581 --> 00:27:21,621
- I don't know.
- What did you do?

348
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:24,252
You should lay down.

349
00:27:24,292 --> 00:27:28,501
I'll be there in a minute.

350
00:27:39,316 --> 00:27:43,949
The students are here.
Evelyn too.

351
00:27:44,373 --> 00:27:46,205
What did you tell Jane?

352
00:27:46,245 --> 00:27:48,926
Nothing.
I don't think she's...

353
00:27:48,965 --> 00:27:53,813
...got the strength
to go through with it.

354
00:27:53,853 --> 00:27:56,717
- I'll take care of it.
- I know.

355
00:27:56,757 --> 00:28:02,423
- We're doing the right thing.
- I know.

356
00:28:12,405 --> 00:28:14,134
Jane?

357
00:28:21,557 --> 00:28:24,229
Edward, no!

358
00:28:37,807 --> 00:28:39,622
Any luck?

359
00:28:39,662 --> 00:28:42,134
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, they're on their way.

360
00:28:42,174 --> 00:28:44,287
Good.

361
00:28:46,847 --> 00:28:49,113
Everything okay?

362
00:28:50,015 --> 00:28:55,679
I don't know. Why did he
tell you not to bring me?

363
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:59,850
- He didn't say.
- God, he's such an asshole.

364
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:08,032
It tears him up, Evy.
It really does.

365
00:29:08,072 --> 00:29:11,736
Look, I know you're probably
still mad about the funeral.

366
00:29:11,776 --> 00:29:14,969
But he did everything
he could to get there.

367
00:29:15,007 --> 00:29:19,442
- I mean, we were snowed in.
- Yeah, I know.

368
00:30:01,016 --> 00:30:02,978
You hear that?

369
00:30:03,017 --> 00:30:06,776
Yeah, what is that?

370
00:30:14,417 --> 00:30:16,777
It sounds like...

371
00:30:16,818 --> 00:30:20,938
...homo sapiens mating.

372
00:30:44,946 --> 00:30:47,467
I missed you so much.

373
00:30:47,506 --> 00:30:49,698
I know you did.

374
00:30:49,738 --> 00:30:51,379
A bug!

375
00:30:51,418 --> 00:30:53,202
- Jesus.
- What?

376
00:30:53,242 --> 00:30:56,299
It's a bug.

377
00:30:57,778 --> 00:31:00,378
- It's just a bug.
- You don't understand.

378
00:31:00,419 --> 00:31:03,179
It's something I've had since
I was a kid. It's a phobia, okay?

379
00:31:03,219 --> 00:31:05,138
It's... it's a...

380
00:31:05,178 --> 00:31:08,779
I can't handle it.

381
00:31:08,819 --> 00:31:10,579
You never told me that.

382
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:13,859
It's not exactly
something I'm proud of.

383
00:31:13,899 --> 00:31:15,499
All right?
Now come on, let's go.

384
00:31:15,539 --> 00:31:19,698
Where are you going?
I'm not going to go sleep out there.

385
00:31:19,739 --> 00:31:22,259
Okay, come on, you don't understand.
I can't stay here.

386
00:31:22,298 --> 00:31:25,499
- Please come with me.
- It's okay, Freddy.

387
00:31:25,539 --> 00:31:28,140
- I'll look after you.
- I can't stay here.

388
00:31:28,179 --> 00:31:33,180
Okay? I'll be
in the other room.

389
00:32:20,277 --> 00:32:21,853
What are you doing?

390
00:32:21,894 --> 00:32:24,349
Somebody's here.

391
00:32:24,581 --> 00:32:26,501
Bart!

392
00:32:27,998 --> 00:32:29,911
- You guys!

393
00:32:30,786 --> 00:32:32,033
- God.

394
00:32:32,125 --> 00:32:35,117
I feel like ass.

395
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:40,062
Dude, your arm is bleeding.

396
00:32:41,861 --> 00:32:45,341
Jeez Louise,
this ain't no flea bite.

397
00:32:45,382 --> 00:32:48,142
- Ow!
- Stop scratching it.

398
00:32:48,181 --> 00:32:50,990
It's flipping itchy, man.

399
00:32:51,125 --> 00:32:53,509
Hello?

400
00:32:56,926 --> 00:32:59,341
Dad?

401
00:33:06,222 --> 00:33:08,702
Hello?

402
00:33:37,247 --> 00:33:39,679
Jane? Oh my God.

403
00:33:40,103 --> 00:33:43,368
Help!
Somebody help!

404
00:33:46,616 --> 00:33:49,336
What was that?

405
00:33:49,472 --> 00:33:53,104
What's going on?

406
00:33:56,343 --> 00:33:58,744
Ling?

407
00:34:02,863 --> 00:34:04,143
No no, Ling...

408
00:34:04,183 --> 00:34:08,304
Ling, honey, it's okay.

409
00:34:10,184 --> 00:34:12,904
Ling, you'll be fine, baby.

410
00:34:12,943 --> 00:34:15,984
- Who the hell is this?
- My dad's assistant.

411
00:34:16,024 --> 00:34:18,224
Evelyn found her
in the helicopter.

412
00:34:18,263 --> 00:34:21,424
Jesus Christ.

413
00:34:32,504 --> 00:34:34,385
I... I thought
there was a bug.

414
00:34:34,424 --> 00:34:36,353
- Uh-huh.
- It was just my zipper.

415
00:34:36,392 --> 00:34:38,505
Yeah.

416
00:34:40,105 --> 00:34:43,665
- I'm gonna try my dad again.
- Okay.

417
00:34:43,705 --> 00:34:45,984
Oh, uh...

418
00:34:46,025 --> 00:34:48,824
...sorry.

419
00:34:50,185 --> 00:34:54,265
Base station
to field station, come in.

420
00:34:54,304 --> 00:34:58,585
Base station to
field station, come in.

421
00:34:58,625 --> 00:35:02,664
Dad, it's me.
Come in.

422
00:35:02,865 --> 00:35:06,625
Dad, are you there?

423
00:35:31,586 --> 00:35:34,906
Ahem.
Is she contagious?

424
00:35:35,138 --> 00:35:36,683
I don't know.

425
00:35:36,723 --> 00:35:38,787
She's burning up.
Might be pneumonia.

426
00:35:38,827 --> 00:35:41,146
We gotta get her out of here.
She needs medical attention.

427
00:35:41,186 --> 00:35:43,051
That's the best idea
I've heard in a long time.

428
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:45,946
This place is infested with bugs.
Ling's got bites all over her face.

429
00:35:45,986 --> 00:35:50,758
We gotta get out of here.
I got this... it's a medical condition.

430
00:35:53,291 --> 00:35:54,771
It's a phobia.
It's like a panic attack!

431
00:35:54,811 --> 00:35:56,459
All right, all right.

432
00:35:56,499 --> 00:35:59,987
As soon as light breaks,
we'll fly out to Sachs Harbour.

433
00:36:00,026 --> 00:36:02,787
What about my dad?
Nobody's answering at the field station.

434
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,573
Something's obviously
happened out there... something bad.

435
00:36:04,612 --> 00:36:08,942
We don't even know where
"out there" is, do we?

436
00:36:13,434 --> 00:36:15,067
What?

437
00:36:16,083 --> 00:36:18,547
Look, the ATV she came
in on has a GPS unit.

438
00:36:18,587 --> 00:36:21,267
We'll get the coordinates for
the field station. We'll fly out there...

439
00:36:21,307 --> 00:36:23,547
...and we'll see what's going on.

440
00:36:23,588 --> 00:36:26,588
If there's an emergency,
we'll call for a second chopper.

441
00:36:26,628 --> 00:36:28,467
Okay, sounds reasonable.

442
00:36:29,179 --> 00:36:30,619
Guys, I'm sorry.

443
00:36:30,659 --> 00:36:33,267
It's all right. Let's load everything
into the helicopter.

444
00:36:33,308 --> 00:36:34,948
We'll come back
and we'll get Jane.

445
00:36:34,988 --> 00:36:38,468
- Thank you.
- Okay.

446
00:36:38,508 --> 00:36:42,307
Where did you get
my dad's camera?

447
00:36:42,348 --> 00:36:46,204
It was in Jane's jacket.

448
00:36:47,035 --> 00:36:51,068
- Are you okay?
- Mm-hmm.

449
00:36:52,396 --> 00:36:56,028
There's no tape.

450
00:36:58,868 --> 00:37:04,077
Okay, guys, come on,
let's get packing. Let's go.

451
00:37:04,117 --> 00:37:06,029
Are you okay?

452
00:37:06,452 --> 00:37:08,469
Yeah.

453
00:37:21,349 --> 00:37:24,190
- What time is it?
- About 3:00 a. M.

454
00:37:24,229 --> 00:37:26,709
Jesus.

455
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:38,718
Holy shit.

456
00:37:38,758 --> 00:37:41,622
What is it?

457
00:37:42,733 --> 00:37:45,414
Oh, man.

458
00:37:47,406 --> 00:37:50,550
- What?
- Take a look.

459
00:37:50,589 --> 00:37:53,950
Jesus H Christ.

460
00:37:54,311 --> 00:37:57,390
- What the heck was she thinking?
- That's a really good question.

461
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:59,830
What?

462
00:38:00,071 --> 00:38:02,190
- Sabotage.
- Jane.

463
00:38:02,998 --> 00:38:05,110
It'll take me a couple
hours to fix this.

464
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:08,647
You gotta be kidding me?
Can't we call another helicopter?

465
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:11,031
It won't take me that long.

466
00:38:11,453 --> 00:38:13,390
Oh, whoa whoa.
What's that for?

467
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:15,191
Relax, it's just a precaution.

468
00:38:15,231 --> 00:38:16,830
- I have to go.
- Evy!

469
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:18,871
- Where are you going?
- The field station.

470
00:38:18,911 --> 00:38:20,590
I don't think
that's a good idea.

471
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:23,190
No kidding. What if this thing's
fixed and you're not back?

472
00:38:23,326 --> 00:38:25,007
Honestly, what do we do?

473
00:38:25,143 --> 00:38:30,649
Hey, that woman's really sick.
I don't think she can breathe.

474
00:38:32,319 --> 00:38:35,191
Come on.

475
00:38:36,511 --> 00:38:39,071
Oh my God,
oh my God.

476
00:38:39,111 --> 00:38:41,271
Oh, Jane!

477
00:38:41,311 --> 00:38:43,551
Jane, it's me. It's Evelyn.

478
00:38:43,591 --> 00:38:45,192
Oh no.

479
00:38:45,231 --> 00:38:47,871
We have to do something!
It's okay.

480
00:38:47,912 --> 00:38:50,040
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

481
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:54,192
Sorry for what?
It's okay.

482
00:38:55,911 --> 00:38:58,791
- Don't let them leave.
- Let who leave?

483
00:38:58,831 --> 00:39:00,712
No.

484
00:39:00,752 --> 00:39:03,312
Holy shit.

485
00:39:03,352 --> 00:39:05,912
- She can't breathe!
- What can I do? Tell me what to do!

486
00:39:05,952 --> 00:39:09,112
No, stay with me, please.
Please!

487
00:39:09,152 --> 00:39:13,184
Jane, stay with me.
It's okay.

488
00:39:14,191 --> 00:39:16,672
No no.

489
00:39:17,072 --> 00:39:22,369
- No!
- No no no no! I wouldn't do that, no.

490
00:39:34,913 --> 00:39:38,793
Better seal off the room.
Who knows what she's got?

491
00:39:38,833 --> 00:39:42,953
Yeah, it's a good call.

492
00:39:44,313 --> 00:39:46,873
There... there's some plastic...

493
00:39:46,912 --> 00:39:48,873
...around back by the genny.

494
00:39:48,914 --> 00:39:51,313
Yeah.

495
00:39:55,833 --> 00:39:59,953
Come on, everybody out.

496
00:40:01,314 --> 00:40:02,633
Now.

497
00:40:02,673 --> 00:40:07,873
Just give me a minute.
I knew her!

498
00:40:14,281 --> 00:40:16,315
Evy.

499
00:40:18,154 --> 00:40:21,115
Oh, God damn it.

500
00:40:34,523 --> 00:40:37,235
Hey, where the hell is she going?
I thought we agreed to stick together?

501
00:40:37,467 --> 00:40:38,908
Adam!

502
00:40:42,722 --> 00:40:45,051
Where the hell do you
think you're going?

503
00:40:45,091 --> 00:40:47,875
That woman just died in there-
man.You Think about it.

504
00:40:48,298 --> 00:40:51,181
That's her dad out there, man.

505
00:40:56,834 --> 00:41:01,635
As soon as that helicopter gets fixed,
we're getting out of here.

506
00:41:02,154 --> 00:41:08,195
Get the duct tape.
Let's seal up this door.

507
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:13,476
Evelyn!

508
00:41:13,708 --> 00:41:18,204
- Wait for me.
- What are you doing?

509
00:41:19,644 --> 00:41:23,675
I'm coming with you.

510
00:42:28,438 --> 00:42:31,798
Why'd you stop?

511
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:53,119
Shoot.

512
00:42:57,590 --> 00:42:59,878
Shoot.

513
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:08,446
- How is it going?
- It's worse than I thought.

514
00:43:08,582 --> 00:43:10,496
Why didn't you say something?
We should be calling for help.

515
00:43:10,536 --> 00:43:15,897
- I'm doing everything I can, okay?
- This is so fucked.

516
00:43:23,919 --> 00:43:26,239
Dad?

517
00:43:31,799 --> 00:43:34,119
Dad?

518
00:43:36,311 --> 00:43:39,479
Holy crap.

519
00:43:43,352 --> 00:43:45,880
Is that a wooly mammoth?

520
00:43:45,919 --> 00:43:49,840
Jesus, it's pristine.

521
00:43:50,441 --> 00:43:52,425
What is it?

522
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:57,680
It looks like eggs of some kind.

523
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:01,329
Yeah, it looks like they're
thawing with the mammoth.

524
00:44:01,657 --> 00:44:03,960
Oh my God,
did you see that?

525
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:07,640
That's impossible.

526
00:44:09,081 --> 00:44:11,320
Isn't there that
species of frog?

527
00:44:11,744 --> 00:44:13,360
Yeah, the-the... Um...

528
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,080
...the wood frog, its liver glycogen
converts to glucose...

529
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:17,529
...but, you know,
that happens over a winter.

530
00:44:17,569 --> 00:44:20,833
This thing's gotta be what?
20,000 years old?

531
00:44:20,872 --> 00:44:22,985
Yeah.

532
00:44:27,113 --> 00:44:29,049
Dad?

533
00:44:32,161 --> 00:44:35,041
Oh... oh my God.

534
00:44:35,081 --> 00:44:37,321
- Who is that?
- It's Edward.

535
00:44:37,361 --> 00:44:40,161
He works for my dad.

536
00:44:40,201 --> 00:44:42,521
Dad!

537
00:44:59,522 --> 00:45:01,641
No no no.

538
00:45:01,682 --> 00:45:05,362
- No no no...
- Evelyn.

539
00:45:05,402 --> 00:45:06,921
No, God, no!

540
00:45:06,961 --> 00:45:08,842
- Don't don't, Evelyn!
- No, please.

541
00:45:08,882 --> 00:45:11,162
- Let go of me!
- You don't want to see him like this.

542
00:45:11,202 --> 00:45:13,482
- No no!
- Don't remember him like this.

543
00:45:13,906 --> 00:45:16,402
It's okay,It's okay.

544
00:45:18,986 --> 00:45:22,939
What am I supposed to do now!

545
00:45:23,771 --> 00:45:25,643
It's not fair!

546
00:45:25,682 --> 00:45:30,371
He's gone and I still hate him.

547
00:45:39,123 --> 00:45:41,803
Ow, ohh.

548
00:45:43,402 --> 00:45:46,963
Oh, Jesus Christ.

549
00:46:03,604 --> 00:46:06,284
I just had the most
painful piss of my life.

550
00:46:06,323 --> 00:46:09,324
- Any idea why?
- What are you saying?

551
00:46:09,364 --> 00:46:12,204
- Oh, little Miss Innocent?
- Oh God.

552
00:46:12,915 --> 00:46:17,053
Who have you been seeing
for the past couple months?

553
00:46:22,524 --> 00:46:26,644
Jesus, baby, I'm sorry.

554
00:46:27,164 --> 00:46:29,964
I just...

555
00:46:30,724 --> 00:46:33,724
Oh, I guess I'm just...

556
00:46:33,765 --> 00:46:37,324
I'm scared, okay.

557
00:46:40,724 --> 00:46:43,644
There's something
wrong with us.

558
00:46:43,684 --> 00:46:47,805
Some kind of infection.

559
00:46:53,245 --> 00:46:57,198
It's inside of me
down there.

560
00:47:16,926 --> 00:47:19,126
What happened?

561
00:47:19,454 --> 00:47:21,646
They're all dead.

562
00:47:21,686 --> 00:47:24,086
Shot.

563
00:47:25,086 --> 00:47:27,286
Jane shot them all.

564
00:47:27,325 --> 00:47:30,406
Kruipen too?

565
00:47:30,646 --> 00:47:34,685
Why would she do that?

566
00:47:34,886 --> 00:47:38,046
I don't know.

567
00:47:44,086 --> 00:47:45,727
Look, man, I don't know
what a "20" is...

568
00:47:45,766 --> 00:47:47,926
I just know that we're
in trouble and we need help now.

569
00:47:47,966 --> 00:47:49,767
I just need to know
where you are.

570
00:47:49,805 --> 00:47:51,246
What are your coordinates?

571
00:47:51,286 --> 00:47:54,726
I don't know where I am, man.
We're in the middle of nowhere.

572
00:47:55,054 --> 00:47:59,769
- David Kruipen's research center.
- Okay, stand by.

573
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:31,928
Ling, are you all right?

574
00:48:32,247 --> 00:48:35,807
Get out. Get out!

575
00:48:42,808 --> 00:48:45,328
- Evy, what are you doing?
- I need to see her.

576
00:48:45,368 --> 00:48:48,047
- This room is quarantined, Evelyn.
- Please!

577
00:48:48,088 --> 00:48:51,288
Please, you have to trust me.
We need to see her, please.

578
00:48:51,328 --> 00:48:53,648
Please trust me.

579
00:48:54,167 --> 00:48:56,288
Please.

580
00:49:19,409 --> 00:49:21,369
Oh God.

581
00:49:21,409 --> 00:49:23,489
What is it?

582
00:49:23,528 --> 00:49:26,729
- Eggs.
- What do you mean eggs?

583
00:49:26,769 --> 00:49:30,089
Like the ones
from the mammoth?

584
00:49:30,128 --> 00:49:32,529
What?

585
00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:43,210
- Oh my God, did you see that?
- What?

586
00:49:43,249 --> 00:49:45,729
- What happened?
- The bugs that bit Ling...

587
00:49:45,770 --> 00:49:48,930
...they must be some kind of parasite.
I just saw one. They're inside of Jane.

588
00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:51,329
- We gotta move her.
- We have to get her to the lab.

589
00:49:51,369 --> 00:49:53,050
It's a separate structure.

590
00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:58,651
Come on, use the sheet
to wrap her up.

591
00:50:16,891 --> 00:50:18,531
What is it, Evy?

592
00:50:18,570 --> 00:50:22,811
The bear's infected too.

593
00:50:26,731 --> 00:50:30,003
There's more eggs over here.

594
00:50:30,331 --> 00:50:34,980
I wonder how long they stay
in their larval state.

595
00:50:36,170 --> 00:50:39,931
I radioed for a rescue helicopter.
We're getting out of here.

596
00:50:39,971 --> 00:50:41,732
- How long?
- A few hours if the weather holds.

597
00:50:41,771 --> 00:50:45,051
Oh, thank God.

598
00:50:45,891 --> 00:50:48,771
What, Evy?

599
00:50:50,907 --> 00:50:53,700
We have to call them back
and tell them not to come.

600
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:56,012
- Excuse me?
- They won't be prepared.

601
00:50:56,243 --> 00:50:59,812
We have to contact disease control.
They'll have time to study this thing...

602
00:50:59,852 --> 00:51:01,772
- And decide what to do.
- What?

603
00:51:01,811 --> 00:51:04,251
- Evelyn, we have to get out of here.
- We have to be quarantined.

604
00:51:04,291 --> 00:51:06,052
Quarantined?
Are you out of your mind?

605
00:51:06,092 --> 00:51:08,580
Ling is sick in there. She's been
throwing up. We have to get out of here.

606
00:51:08,621 --> 00:51:11,453
- Frederico, you don't understand.
- Hold on, hold on.

607
00:51:12,067 --> 00:51:14,092
Maybe we're jumping
to conclusions.

608
00:51:14,132 --> 00:51:16,157
I mean, we're just
students here.

609
00:51:16,389 --> 00:51:18,772
She's not even a student.

610
00:51:18,811 --> 00:51:22,269
They died out there
because they couldn't stop it!

611
00:51:22,309 --> 00:51:24,604
They're dead?

612
00:51:24,643 --> 00:51:26,693
Jane was trying to stop us
from getting home.

613
00:51:26,733 --> 00:51:30,268
She said don't let them leave...
she was talking about the bugs.

614
00:51:30,308 --> 00:51:33,115
- What do you mean?What bugs?
- Look, you don't know that.

615
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:34,972
We don't know what
happened out there.

616
00:51:35,013 --> 00:51:37,253
- You saw the eggs in the mammoth, Adam.
- Mammoth?

617
00:51:37,676 --> 00:51:39,933
Jesus Christ, would somebody please
tell me what's going on here?

618
00:51:39,973 --> 00:51:43,293
There's a wooly mammoth
in a glacier melting out there.

619
00:51:43,332 --> 00:51:46,573
It's full of eggs.
The same ones that are in this bear...

620
00:51:46,613 --> 00:51:51,605
...the same ones that are in Jane, and very
likely, the same ones that are in Ling.

621
00:51:52,317 --> 00:51:54,821
And me.

622
00:51:57,909 --> 00:52:00,612
And Ling?

623
00:52:01,813 --> 00:52:03,414
Fred...

624
00:52:03,454 --> 00:52:06,214
...we think that the insects
that bit Ling...

625
00:52:06,637 --> 00:52:10,453
- They're laying eggs inside.
- What?

626
00:52:10,493 --> 00:52:12,653
They're some sort
of prehistoric parasite...

627
00:52:12,694 --> 00:52:15,102
...that thawed in the ice
inside the mammoth.

628
00:52:16,005 --> 00:52:18,013
This is so sick.

629
00:52:18,054 --> 00:52:20,654
You guys are sick. Where would you
come up with something like this?

630
00:52:20,694 --> 00:52:23,694
We have to contact disease control.
They'll know what to do better than us.

631
00:52:23,734 --> 00:52:26,214
No no.

632
00:52:28,814 --> 00:52:30,255
No no... Hey!
Where are you going?

633
00:52:30,295 --> 00:52:32,975
Hey hey!

634
00:52:33,455 --> 00:52:37,094
We could die here.

635
00:52:38,495 --> 00:52:42,414
Hey, stay away
from the radio!

636
00:52:42,455 --> 00:52:45,615
Don't. Don't!

637
00:52:48,295 --> 00:52:53,768
- Put the gun down!
- I didn't have a choice.

638
00:52:56,175 --> 00:53:01,000
I'm in charge now. Until the helicopter
arrives, I'm in charge!

639
00:53:01,231 --> 00:53:05,455
What was that noise?

640
00:53:07,775 --> 00:53:11,496
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, it's just a scratch.

641
00:53:11,535 --> 00:53:14,415
Oh, Jesus.

642
00:53:15,295 --> 00:53:19,775
- Hey, baby.
- When are we going home?

643
00:53:19,815 --> 00:53:23,375
Soon, baby, soon.

644
00:53:25,616 --> 00:53:28,096
Jesus.

645
00:53:29,695 --> 00:53:31,295
It's the same color as...

646
00:53:31,335 --> 00:53:35,136
- As what?
- Maybe you'd be comfortable lying down.

647
00:53:35,175 --> 00:53:37,775
- That's a good idea.
- Same color as what?

648
00:53:38,295 --> 00:53:42,777
All right, put her
in the spare bedroom.

649
00:53:42,816 --> 00:53:44,736
It's okay, baby.

650
00:53:45,064 --> 00:53:48,045
You'll be fine.
You just need to lie down for a minute.

651
00:53:55,568 --> 00:54:00,657
- Where's Freddy?
- I'm right here, babe.

652
00:54:01,257 --> 00:54:04,017
- When are we going home?
- Soon.

653
00:54:04,057 --> 00:54:08,777
Really soon.
It won't be long now.

654
00:54:10,584 --> 00:54:13,178
Wait.

655
00:54:35,658 --> 00:54:39,298
We need to seal off the room.

656
00:54:39,338 --> 00:54:44,130
- What about me?
- Good question.

657
00:54:45,258 --> 00:54:49,658
You guys need to see this.

658
00:55:01,059 --> 00:55:03,178
What is that?

659
00:55:03,219 --> 00:55:06,659
What do you think it is?

660
00:55:06,698 --> 00:55:09,579
Oh my God.

661
00:55:15,139 --> 00:55:17,459
Ohh.

662
00:55:25,939 --> 00:55:27,740
Do you think they can get out?

663
00:55:27,779 --> 00:55:30,419
No. But we need
to seal that door.

664
00:55:30,459 --> 00:55:32,859
Okay.

665
00:55:36,539 --> 00:55:40,260
I need to do
something about this.

666
00:55:40,299 --> 00:55:43,179
Right now.

667
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:54,419
Bart, wait.
What are you going to do?

668
00:55:54,939 --> 00:55:59,820
I doubt there's a chopper between
here and Dawson City this time of year.

669
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:01,980
They're not gonna
be here for a while...

670
00:56:02,021 --> 00:56:06,493
...and I ain't got that kind of time.

671
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:09,900
If these things hatch,
they'll spread.

672
00:56:09,941 --> 00:56:14,340
If that happens, I'm done.

673
00:56:15,021 --> 00:56:17,460
If I can just kind
of get underneath...

674
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:20,652
...some of them.

675
00:56:25,517 --> 00:56:29,340
If I can just...

676
00:56:31,061 --> 00:56:36,741
It's starting to come off a little bit.

677
00:56:42,621 --> 00:56:45,974
- Oh shit.
- Oh, Jesus!

678
00:57:02,086 --> 00:57:03,805
No.

679
00:57:04,102 --> 00:57:05,742
No no no,
don't look at me.

680
00:57:05,781 --> 00:57:09,661
Bart, no, you'll lose
too much blood.

681
00:57:09,702 --> 00:57:12,574
Okay, then...

682
00:57:13,302 --> 00:57:15,342
...we'll burn them out then.
I don't see why not.

683
00:57:15,382 --> 00:57:16,990
We'll just douse
the arm in gasoline.

684
00:57:17,031 --> 00:57:22,315
How do you know if you'll get them all?
You'll have to burn it to the bone.

685
00:57:26,862 --> 00:57:28,783
If you don't do it...

686
00:57:29,111 --> 00:57:31,182
I will.

687
00:57:31,702 --> 00:57:35,822
We have to be
more prepared.

688
00:57:49,143 --> 00:57:52,623
Are you sure about this?
I don't even know if this is morphine.

689
00:57:52,663 --> 00:57:55,583
The worst that can
happen is that I OD.

690
00:57:55,815 --> 00:58:00,143
There are worse ways to go.

691
00:58:02,903 --> 00:58:06,943
Go on, man, jab it in.

692
00:58:14,744 --> 00:58:17,825
Jeez Louise.

693
00:58:27,943 --> 00:58:29,864
There we go.

694
00:58:29,905 --> 00:58:35,184
Oooh, a guy could
get used to that.

695
00:58:44,585 --> 00:58:48,624
All right, man, do it.

696
00:58:56,985 --> 00:58:58,905
Something's happening
in there.

697
00:58:58,945 --> 00:59:02,218
They're hatching.

698
00:59:04,025 --> 00:59:06,625
Okay,Okay,
here we go.

699
00:59:07,816 --> 00:59:09,744
Adam, hurry!

700
00:59:17,074 --> 00:59:21,898
This isn't right.
You can't just chop off body parts.

701
00:59:23,186 --> 00:59:26,066
This isn't the way.

702
00:59:26,106 --> 00:59:27,346
- Adam.
- Do it.

703
00:59:27,386 --> 00:59:29,786
Adam!

704
00:59:32,146 --> 00:59:33,945
- Adam, do it again!
- Oooh.

705
00:59:33,985 --> 00:59:36,387
Adam!

706
00:59:48,746 --> 00:59:52,466
- Evelyn.
- Oh my God.

707
00:59:53,178 --> 00:59:54,906
Bart.

708
00:59:56,755 --> 01:00:00,107
Get the bugs.

709
01:00:01,027 --> 01:00:06,107
- With what?
- Try the bug spray.

710
01:00:08,387 --> 01:00:11,667
- It's not working.
- There's a lighter... try it.

711
01:00:11,803 --> 01:00:15,627
God, I can't stop it.

712
01:00:21,987 --> 01:00:24,668
It's working.
It's working.

713
01:00:24,707 --> 01:00:27,587
I need something else to stop
the bleeding. This is not working.

714
01:00:27,915 --> 01:00:32,155
I saw in the...
ATV kit.

715
01:00:51,596 --> 01:00:53,395
Is he okay?

716
01:00:53,436 --> 01:00:57,716
- The bleeding's starting to slow.
- Aw, he could go into shock.

717
01:00:57,756 --> 01:00:59,796
Get his arm up.
Get his arm up.

718
01:00:59,836 --> 01:01:02,236
We gotta put him on the couch.
Lie him on his back.

719
01:01:02,276 --> 01:01:03,796
Okay?
Okay?

720
01:01:04,316 --> 01:01:06,356
Come on, come on.
There we go.

721
01:01:06,588 --> 01:01:09,676
- Get some gauze and some tape.
- Okay.

722
01:01:09,716 --> 01:01:13,596
Lie him on his back. Okay, wait...
put his feet up, okay?

723
01:01:13,636 --> 01:01:16,037
- Put his feet up.
- Oh, fuck.

724
01:01:16,077 --> 01:01:17,876
There we go.
There we go, buddy.

725
01:01:17,916 --> 01:01:21,597
Got the tape.
We need some gauze.

726
01:01:21,828 --> 01:01:24,037
Shit.

727
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:29,397
What the hell?

728
01:01:31,301 --> 01:01:33,317
Shit.

729
01:01:41,917 --> 01:01:44,557
It looks like they knew
what they were dealing with.

730
01:01:44,981 --> 01:01:46,917
Who?

731
01:01:47,414 --> 01:01:50,878
Dr. Kruipen.

732
01:01:53,197 --> 01:01:55,518
It's a vertebrate.
It's not a bug.

733
01:01:55,558 --> 01:01:57,838
- So we're related to this thing?
- Yeah.

734
01:01:58,357 --> 01:02:01,117
It says that the males are harmless,
except for they create the sores...

735
01:02:01,158 --> 01:02:04,038
...that the females bore into
and then they lay their eggs...

736
01:02:04,174 --> 01:02:05,710
...and multiply.

737
01:02:05,750 --> 01:02:07,957
What are you saying?
If you're bit by a male...

738
01:02:07,998 --> 01:02:09,758
...you might not necessarily
be infected?

739
01:02:09,798 --> 01:02:12,198
Yeah, the eggs
are the only threat.

740
01:02:13,293 --> 01:02:15,767
These tapes, they only
date up to yesterday.

741
01:02:15,806 --> 01:02:17,671
We have to see what's on them.
We need to know exactly...

742
01:02:17,710 --> 01:02:19,471
.. what we're
dealing with right now.

743
01:02:19,511 --> 01:02:23,438
This tape's the most recent.
Where's my dad's camera?

744
01:02:23,670 --> 01:02:29,249
It's with Jane's jacket.
But we put all that stuff in the lab.

745
01:02:34,439 --> 01:02:36,839
- What the hell are you doing?
- We have to get in there.

746
01:02:37,166 --> 01:02:39,439
You're not going back in there.
It's completely sealed.

747
01:02:39,478 --> 01:02:41,278
You're just going to bring
those bugs back in here with you.

748
01:02:41,319 --> 01:02:43,839
We need to get the information
before the helicopter gets here.

749
01:02:44,551 --> 01:02:49,087
There might be something
in there that can help Ling.

750
01:02:49,127 --> 01:02:51,559
Maybe save us all.

751
01:02:51,982 --> 01:02:57,154
You get any bugs on you,
you're not coming back in here.

752
01:03:59,881 --> 01:04:02,201
Evelyn!
Behind you!

753
01:04:02,241 --> 01:04:04,642
Shit.

754
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:09,761
There's no fucking way she's getting
in here. She's covered in bugs.

755
01:04:09,801 --> 01:04:13,722
- Back off!
- Let me out! Let me out!

756
01:04:13,761 --> 01:04:16,241
No no!

757
01:04:16,921 --> 01:04:21,010
There's... There's...
there's bugs on her!

758
01:04:21,434 --> 01:04:24,481
Adam, step away from her.

759
01:04:24,522 --> 01:04:26,322
Adam, step away.

760
01:04:26,746 --> 01:04:28,962
There's one under my shirt!

761
01:04:29,002 --> 01:04:30,938
God!

762
01:04:32,202 --> 01:04:36,065
- What the fuck is that?
- Get it out.

763
01:04:36,042 --> 01:04:38,834
Get it!

764
01:04:40,922 --> 01:04:44,363
- It's fine.
- What if it laid eggs in her? Huh?

765
01:04:44,403 --> 01:04:46,362
I got it. She's fine.

766
01:04:46,402 --> 01:04:48,602
All right. Um...

767
01:04:48,642 --> 01:04:51,706
...the rest now.

768
01:04:51,842 --> 01:04:53,163
She's clean, Fred.
Drop it.

769
01:04:53,203 --> 01:04:55,962
Take the rest
of your clothes off.

770
01:04:56,002 --> 01:04:57,922
- Now.
- It's okay.

771
01:04:58,250 --> 01:05:00,202
He's right.

772
01:05:00,242 --> 01:05:04,963
Adam, I need you
to check me.

773
01:05:40,604 --> 01:05:42,403
She's clean.

774
01:05:42,443 --> 01:05:44,844
Okay.

775
01:05:52,444 --> 01:05:56,004
I had to be sure.

776
01:06:31,875 --> 01:06:35,270
Are you sure you
want to see this?

777
01:06:35,310 --> 01:06:38,286
Of course.

778
01:06:39,126 --> 01:06:43,165
I'm really sorry,
you know?

779
01:06:43,205 --> 01:06:47,582
Whatever happened between you
and your dad, I know it must be hard.

780
01:06:48,006 --> 01:06:51,206
The weather's cleaning up.
They should be here soon.

781
01:06:51,246 --> 01:06:53,486
What exactly are you guys
trying to find on that tape?

782
01:06:53,430 --> 01:06:55,783
I mean, they're bugs and they
eat people... it's that simple.

783
01:06:55,822 --> 01:06:58,407
We need to know what's gonna
happen if the bugs get off the island.

784
01:06:58,446 --> 01:06:59,967
What kind of habitat
can they survive in?

785
01:07:00,007 --> 01:07:02,326
What are the odds
of this turning into a pandemic?

786
01:07:02,366 --> 01:07:03,926
My dad would have
thought this through.

787
01:07:03,965 --> 01:07:08,032
We have to get that
information back.

788
01:07:08,839 --> 01:07:11,366
"Today I rediscovered...

789
01:07:11,406 --> 01:07:16,406
...what I knew when
I was young.

790
01:07:17,126 --> 01:07:19,046
Whoa!
One got out.

791
01:07:19,470 --> 01:07:22,646
Somebody kill it.

792
01:08:08,904 --> 01:08:11,688
Oh my God.

793
01:08:25,128 --> 01:08:27,249
It's time to get out of here.

794
01:08:27,288 --> 01:08:29,768
We have to get
to the helicopter.

795
01:08:29,808 --> 01:08:33,169
It's the only safe place.
Everything else should be burned.

796
01:08:33,208 --> 01:08:35,248
- Help me! Help me!
- Oh my God.

797
01:08:35,288 --> 01:08:39,649
Shit, they're coming
through the vents.

798
01:08:39,689 --> 01:08:41,281
- We've got to get her out of there.
- No, we can't.

799
01:08:41,321 --> 01:08:43,841
- There's too many. It's too dangerous.
- We gotta do something.

800
01:08:43,881 --> 01:08:49,370
- What's going on?
- The vertebrates... they're with Ling.

801
01:08:50,561 --> 01:08:54,442
We gotta sedate her.
Get me some drugs, man.

802
01:08:54,482 --> 01:08:56,362
Get me something to wear...
something protective.

803
01:08:56,401 --> 01:08:58,242
Jeez, you almost fell.

804
01:08:59,336 --> 01:09:03,041
You gotta loosen this.
It's too tight.

805
01:09:03,369 --> 01:09:05,762
I can't.

806
01:09:08,642 --> 01:09:10,162
Freddy!

807
01:09:10,203 --> 01:09:12,802
Freddy, open this door, Freddy.

808
01:09:12,842 --> 01:09:15,762
- Almost got it.
- Agh.

809
01:09:16,474 --> 01:09:18,723
Help me, Freddy.

810
01:09:18,762 --> 01:09:23,562
Oh, please,
you have them too.

811
01:09:30,202 --> 01:09:34,602
Freddy, what are you doing?

812
01:09:38,763 --> 01:09:42,604
She was suffering.
She asked me to.

813
01:09:53,082 --> 01:09:55,763
She's still alive.

814
01:09:55,802 --> 01:09:59,563
You son of a bitch.

815
01:10:07,684 --> 01:10:11,443
I gotta sedate her.

816
01:10:21,163 --> 01:10:24,124
Bart, wait.

817
01:10:25,564 --> 01:10:27,444
It's okay, Evy.

818
01:10:27,484 --> 01:10:32,283
- I got nothing to lose.
- No.

819
01:10:40,116 --> 01:10:45,765
Evelyn, come on.
Come on, we've gotta go.

820
01:11:20,948 --> 01:11:25,063
We need to make sure
everyone's clean before we leave.

821
01:11:26,925 --> 01:11:31,446
I'm going straight
to the helicopter.

822
01:11:36,398 --> 01:11:39,726
Anybody who wants to leave
can come with me.

823
01:11:39,862 --> 01:11:44,086
It's just a precaution.
We're not accusing you of anything.

824
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:48,366
We just want to be sure.

825
01:11:48,622 --> 01:11:51,406
Fuck that.

826
01:11:51,606 --> 01:11:54,366
Frederico, wait!

827
01:11:54,982 --> 01:11:59,623
You can't go in there.
I know why you shot Ling.

828
01:12:00,526 --> 01:12:05,167
You're gonna fuck
this up, aren't you!

829
01:12:05,303 --> 01:12:08,846
- Fred...
- Shut the fuck up, Adam.

830
01:12:09,174 --> 01:12:11,926
Soon as the helicopter gets here,
she's gonna blow the whistle on me.

831
01:12:11,967 --> 01:12:17,129
And that means I'm gonna
die with these fucking bugs in my dick.

832
01:12:19,087 --> 01:12:20,966
I can't let that happen.

833
01:12:21,582 --> 01:12:23,528
Please don't.

834
01:12:23,759 --> 01:12:26,447
I'm sorry.

835
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:31,808
Dad?

836
01:12:32,231 --> 01:12:35,408
- Dad!
- Kruipen.

837
01:12:36,359 --> 01:12:37,888
Oh my God,
you're alive!

838
01:12:38,887 --> 01:12:40,567
I'm sorry.

839
01:12:41,375 --> 01:12:42,847
Me too.

840
01:12:43,271 --> 01:12:44,927
I'm so sorry.

841
01:12:44,968 --> 01:12:48,713
- Are you infected?
- No.

842
01:12:50,359 --> 01:12:52,528
- You're shot.
- I'm okay.

843
01:12:54,582 --> 01:12:56,031
Jane...

844
01:12:56,112 --> 01:12:57,728
Jane died.

845
01:12:58,439 --> 01:13:00,304
She sabotaged
the helicopter.

846
01:13:00,728 --> 01:13:02,409
It's okay though.
We already called for help.

847
01:13:03,024 --> 01:13:05,857
The whole place...
it's almost entirely infested.

848
01:13:05,896 --> 01:13:08,648
Now the only safe place
is the helicopter.

849
01:13:08,976 --> 01:13:12,440
We're gonna burn it down.

850
01:13:13,344 --> 01:13:15,248
There's some gasoline
around the back.

851
01:13:15,288 --> 01:13:18,088
- You should wait in the helicopter.
- I'll be okay. Go on.

852
01:13:18,704 --> 01:13:21,889
Go ahead.
Go ahead.

853
01:13:48,769 --> 01:13:53,596
Bet you wish you didn't
get on that helicopter now, huh?

854
01:13:55,649 --> 01:13:58,050
What?

855
01:13:59,930 --> 01:14:02,610
He knew.

856
01:14:10,730 --> 01:14:14,362
"These parasites were
discovered in a thawing glacier.

857
01:14:14,498 --> 01:14:16,490
They are just one...

858
01:14:16,531 --> 01:14:21,051
...of the horrors that will
come from global warming.

859
01:14:21,091 --> 01:14:22,810
And so today I...

860
01:14:22,947 --> 01:14:25,571
...prepare this statement...

861
01:14:26,282 --> 01:14:28,250
...as I prepare myself...

862
01:14:28,866 --> 01:14:32,171
...for the ultimate sacrifice,
the only sacrifice.

863
01:14:32,978 --> 01:14:35,251
Though thousands will die...

864
01:14:35,290 --> 01:14:37,450
...the threat will surely
be contained.

865
01:14:38,450 --> 01:14:41,739
This video, too,
will surely be contained.

866
01:14:42,833 --> 01:14:45,212
But the impact of both...

867
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:47,491
...will survive...

868
01:14:47,531 --> 01:14:49,379
...spread through the veins
of the internet...

869
01:14:49,419 --> 01:14:51,492
...onto the screens
of the youth...

870
01:14:51,916 --> 01:14:53,891
...into your souls...

871
01:14:54,123 --> 01:14:55,892
...into your spirit.

872
01:14:55,931 --> 01:14:58,131
You will know the need
to sacrifice.

873
01:14:58,171 --> 01:15:02,971
You will know
the time is now.

874
01:15:29,853 --> 01:15:34,316
You were right, Evy.
No one cares.

875
01:15:34,452 --> 01:15:36,333
May I have the tape, please?

876
01:15:36,373 --> 01:15:39,253
Dad, please. Please don't do this.
There has to be another way.

877
01:15:39,292 --> 01:15:42,093
Please.
People listen to you.

878
01:15:42,133 --> 01:15:45,133
- You didn't.
- I only said that to hurt you.

879
01:15:45,173 --> 01:15:47,533
You were right.
You've always been right.

880
01:15:47,573 --> 01:15:51,333
We can change people's minds, but, Dad,
this is not the way to do it, please.

881
01:15:51,374 --> 01:15:53,132
I'm getting on the helicopter.

882
01:15:53,173 --> 01:15:55,053
Alone.

883
01:15:55,093 --> 01:15:57,613
When the fear...
when it spreads...

884
01:15:57,653 --> 01:15:59,093
...the people will know.

885
01:15:59,133 --> 01:16:02,253
- You can't go.
- Maybe he's right.

886
01:16:02,293 --> 01:16:04,093
How could he
possibly be right?

887
01:16:04,517 --> 01:16:08,094
Dad, you were going to save me.
What about everybody else?

888
01:16:08,517 --> 01:16:10,694
What about
other people's children?

889
01:16:10,829 --> 01:16:13,413
How do you know how quickly
they'll be able to isolate it?

890
01:16:13,453 --> 01:16:16,175
How many people
are going to die? Thousands.

891
01:16:16,214 --> 01:16:21,174
Maybe hundreds of thousands.
Plenty more where they came from, right?

892
01:16:21,214 --> 01:16:24,750
Please. Please don't.

893
01:16:26,933 --> 01:16:29,525
I'm sorry...I'm sorry.

894
01:16:35,509 --> 01:16:36,775
Dad!

895
01:16:37,870 --> 01:16:38,919
No!

896
01:16:41,654 --> 01:16:45,454
- No.
- The window... gotta go to the window.

897
01:16:45,974 --> 01:16:48,374
Oh my God.

898
01:16:55,535 --> 01:17:00,255
That's Dr. Kruipen.
He looks hurt.

899
01:17:05,231 --> 01:17:07,056
Are you okay?

900
01:17:07,095 --> 01:17:11,330
- I should take a look at that.
- No, let's go.

901
01:17:17,158 --> 01:17:19,016
Hey, is there
somebody else in there?

902
01:17:19,631 --> 01:17:21,535
Quarantine.
They're contaminated.

903
01:17:22,247 --> 01:17:25,016
- Are you contaminated?
- No. Let's go.

904
01:17:25,056 --> 01:17:27,176
Aw, shit!

905
01:17:27,695 --> 01:17:30,175
Stop, he's infected!

906
01:17:30,791 --> 01:17:34,905
Stop, this whole area's
quarantined!

907
01:17:36,199 --> 01:17:40,096
- He's on the skid.
- If he gets in, we die.

908
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:42,816
- He's infected.
- What did he say?

909
01:17:42,856 --> 01:17:44,376
This whole area's quarantined.

910
01:17:44,703 --> 01:17:47,280
Something about the quarantine.
We've got to put him down.

911
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:50,056
We can't.

912
01:17:50,096 --> 01:17:52,177
He's infected.

913
01:17:52,216 --> 01:17:57,777
He's rocking us.
I can't stabilize it.

914
01:18:01,897 --> 01:18:06,106
- Jesus Christ. Is he okay?
- He's not moving.

915
01:18:09,128 --> 01:18:11,857
- We need to go now.
- What about her?

916
01:18:11,993 --> 01:18:14,016
- She'll be okay.
- No.

917
01:18:14,057 --> 01:18:16,257
No.

918
01:18:23,913 --> 01:18:25,858
Hey, she's got a gun!

919
01:18:26,473 --> 01:18:27,297
Get up, get up!

920
01:18:27,338 --> 01:18:30,137
Aw, fuck!

921
01:18:31,914 --> 01:18:34,218
Fuck!

922
01:18:37,353 --> 01:18:39,458
Come on!

923
01:19:07,419 --> 01:19:09,898
Oh my God, no, we need
to get you to the helicopter.

924
01:19:09,938 --> 01:19:12,658
No, it's too late.

925
01:19:12,699 --> 01:19:15,995
- No.
- It's too late.

926
01:19:16,419 --> 01:19:20,170
You have to... you have to get your
father's notes. You have to warn them.

927
01:19:20,403 --> 01:19:21,979
I can't.

928
01:19:22,306 --> 01:19:24,251
No, I can't leave you here.
I can't do this.

929
01:19:24,291 --> 01:19:26,898
Yes, you can, Evy.

930
01:19:27,993 --> 01:19:29,899
This is it.

931
01:19:32,379 --> 01:19:35,371
The ball is rolling.

932
01:19:38,740 --> 01:19:42,108
This is the beginning.

933
01:19:44,659 --> 01:19:47,260
No. No.

934
01:21:36,206 --> 01:21:38,463
What is sacrifice?

935
01:21:38,790 --> 01:21:40,350
We keep saying
we want change...

936
01:21:40,391 --> 01:21:43,606
...but we just keep doing the same
shitty things every day.

937
01:21:43,647 --> 01:21:47,183
And that's no justification
for what my father did.

938
01:21:48,278 --> 01:21:50,022
Or what he tried to do.

939
01:21:50,542 --> 01:21:52,703
A body! There's a body
over here!

940
01:21:52,743 --> 01:21:55,663
But I want people to know that he
really did believe he was helping us...

941
01:21:55,703 --> 01:21:59,384
...and he sacrificed everything...
including himself.

942
01:22:00,670 --> 01:22:01,823
I have a pulse!

943
01:22:01,863 --> 01:22:04,343
Come on, let's get
her out of there!

944
01:22:04,767 --> 01:22:07,023
I used to believe that
people couldn't change...

945
01:22:07,926 --> 01:22:09,343
...that all we could do was just...

946
01:22:09,384 --> 01:22:13,904
...have as much fun as we could
before it all came to an end.

947
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:16,183
But now...

948
01:22:16,511 --> 01:22:21,024
...now I don't want it to end.

949
01:22:42,648 --> 01:22:44,544
All right, we're back and today...

950
01:22:44,584 --> 01:22:46,337
...we're talking
about Evelyn Kruipen...

951
01:22:46,473 --> 01:22:49,665
...daughter of infamous ecologist,
Dr. David Kruipen.

952
01:22:49,704 --> 01:22:51,585
- Max!
- Now she's being hailed as a hero.

953
01:22:51,625 --> 01:22:54,305
- Max, come on.
- She's on the front of every newspaper...

954
01:22:54,345 --> 01:22:56,825
- And website around the globe.
- Come on, boy, let's go.

955
01:22:56,865 --> 01:22:59,384
The Center for Disease Control
said this young woman...

956
01:22:59,425 --> 01:23:01,465
...saved us from total annihilation.

957
01:23:01,505 --> 01:23:03,265
Well, I don't know, Mike.

958
01:23:03,305 --> 01:23:08,786
You're a bit of a conspiracy nut.
What do you think?

959
01:23:14,665 --> 01:23:16,545
Well, callers, what do you think?

960
01:23:16,585 --> 01:23:19,104
What is going to end
the human race?

961
01:23:19,145 --> 01:23:21,346
A giant meteor out of the sky?

962
01:23:21,386 --> 01:23:23,345
Are we all going
to starve to death?

963
01:23:23,386 --> 01:23:26,745
Or is a tiny little bug going
to come and wipe us all out?

964
01:23:26,785 --> 01:23:28,785
First caller, you're on the air.

965
01:23:28,825 --> 01:23:31,705
I honestly think it's just more
global warming propaganda.

966
01:23:31,746 --> 01:23:33,786
I... I think the whole thing's
just a marketing scam.

967
01:23:33,826 --> 01:23:35,586
It's just another example...

968
01:23:35,626 --> 01:23:36,947
...of how vulnerable
we are, you know?

969
01:23:36,986 --> 01:23:38,786
You've got SARS, bird flu, AIDS.

970
01:23:38,902 --> 01:23:42,738
It's just a matter of time
before the big one comes.

971
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:51,688
The End.

972
01:23:53,806 --> 01:23:54,765
