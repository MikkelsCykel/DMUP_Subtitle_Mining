1
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:09,709
(Car horns)

2
00:01:09,779 --> 00:01:11,688
(Crash)

3
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:41,273
(Radio) '..in downtown Los Angeles
right now. Here with the traffic...'

4
00:01:57,342 --> 00:01:59,230
I've been waiting for 15 minutes.

5
00:01:59,294 --> 00:02:02,045
- Thought you were stuck in traffic?
- You late?

6
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:04,567
- You got all the paperwork?
- Yeah.

7
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,576
Are you pissed off at me?
I'm just doing my part.

8
00:02:07,648 --> 00:02:10,617
- I know, I know.
- You're my guy, Jerry, my guy.

9
00:02:16,706 --> 00:02:20,003
'Margolese Holdings,
how may I direct your call? '

10
00:02:20,067 --> 00:02:22,915
- Yes, I'll put you through.
- Hey, Estelle.

11
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,185
Is that Nayman's little nephew?

12
00:02:25,253 --> 00:02:28,832
- Yeah, that's Big Tom.
- Big Tom! Sure, it is?

13
00:02:28,902 --> 00:02:32,164
- How's it goin' there, Big Tom?
- Hey, hey. Look.

14
00:02:35,592 --> 00:02:37,828
Shh. See? See?

15
00:02:37,895 --> 00:02:39,652
Why are you scaring the kid?

16
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,754
- I-I was just...
- Did you get that passport?

17
00:02:42,857 --> 00:02:44,515
Yes.

18
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,671
- I have issues.
- Issues, Jerry.

19
00:02:48,746 --> 00:02:52,042
It burns my ass to write you
a check every week.

20
00:02:52,107 --> 00:02:54,213
I can explain what happened.

21
00:02:54,284 --> 00:02:56,553
You say that
when it's once in a while.

22
00:02:56,652 --> 00:03:00,264
- It's every time, Jerry.
- It's every fuckin' time.

23
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:03,717
And I can certainly
understand that perspective.

24
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:06,441
But I've been having
some personal problems...

25
00:03:06,511 --> 00:03:09,096
uh, with my life.

26
00:03:09,167 --> 00:03:13,063
My girlfriend, she's a great girl,
but she has complaints.

27
00:03:13,136 --> 00:03:16,301
I don't but, she does.
If you want to know the truth,

28
00:03:16,369 --> 00:03:19,948
I can't even believe this,
but we go to a group.

29
00:03:23,091 --> 00:03:25,513
So...last week,

30
00:03:25,587 --> 00:03:28,850
when you guys told me to pick up
the thing at the thing,

31
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:32,266
well, Samantha says she needs
the car to pick up some things.

32
00:03:32,341 --> 00:03:37,077
And, I don't have to tell you boys,
I mean, things got heated, right?

33
00:03:37,142 --> 00:03:39,630
And she hid them.

34
00:03:39,703 --> 00:03:41,492
She hid them?

35
00:03:46,424 --> 00:03:48,978
Oh! The keys. She hid them.

36
00:03:49,081 --> 00:03:52,660
She... You know, and I couldn't
get to the thing on time,

37
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:55,578
and it all got messed up
and I think that maybe...

38
00:03:55,674 --> 00:03:59,450
Maybe some things
aren't meant to happen.

39
00:04:00,475 --> 00:04:02,516
Jerry, you're a fucking moron.

40
00:04:04,349 --> 00:04:08,375
Here are your options. Number one,
I roll you up in a carpet,

41
00:04:08,477 --> 00:04:10,933
stuff you in a Sedan
and set fire to you.

42
00:04:11,006 --> 00:04:14,520
- You with me? Choice one.
- Yeah.

43
00:04:14,591 --> 00:04:17,788
Number two. You like sex and travel?

44
00:04:17,888 --> 00:04:21,271
What, you like to have sex?
You like to travel?

45
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:25,502
Get on a flight to Mexico. All the
hookers you can shake your stick at.

46
00:04:25,601 --> 00:04:27,991
Pick up a pistol
that belongs to Margolese.

47
00:04:28,098 --> 00:04:31,448
- What's it gonna be?
- OK, I was under the impression

48
00:04:31,523 --> 00:04:35,714
with Margolese getting out of jail,
that the last job was my last job.

49
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:38,595
- You fucked up that job.
- You fucked it up.

50
00:04:38,692 --> 00:04:40,547
This job will be your last job.

51
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,555
OK, but a trip right now...

52
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:46,275
He asked for you. Want me to call him
and say you can't go?

53
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:49,277
Because I'll call. I'd love to.

54
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:53,182
You're goin' on a fucking trip.
The town's called San Miguel.

55
00:04:53,288 --> 00:04:56,737
You look for a kid in a bar,
the El Alamo.

56
00:04:56,809 --> 00:05:01,666
This is a simple fucking task.
Write it down. Roll up your sleeves.

57
00:05:01,738 --> 00:05:04,291
- Get involved!
- Ow!

58
00:05:04,362 --> 00:05:08,706
The kid's name is Beck. He's got this
particular gun. He's waiting on you.

59
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:11,268
- Beck.
- When you find him, bring him

60
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,545
and the gun back Stateside, got it?

61
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:16,515
Last chance, Jerry.
I'm telling you. The last.

62
00:05:16,589 --> 00:05:18,924
Even he's getting tired of your shit.

63
00:05:18,991 --> 00:05:20,998
I'll take care of it, Bernie.

64
00:05:21,103 --> 00:05:24,399
Vaya con Dios, motherfucker.
You're in coach.

65
00:05:31,345 --> 00:05:33,200
Baby, what are you doing?

66
00:05:33,298 --> 00:05:35,404
You said this was your last job!

67
00:05:35,507 --> 00:05:38,321
What do you want me to say?
"Sorry I can't,

68
00:05:38,387 --> 00:05:40,908
"the old lady wants me to quit.
Fuck off."

69
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:44,297
Yes! Something like that.
Like exactly!

70
00:05:44,373 --> 00:05:46,348
I'm not in insurance, sweetie!

71
00:05:46,421 --> 00:05:50,545
If you get on that plane, you will
never, never, ever see me again.

72
00:05:50,614 --> 00:05:53,364
You got me?
We talked about this. I told you.

73
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:56,017
I wanted us to go
to Las Vegas for me.

74
00:05:56,119 --> 00:05:59,317
- Not you, me.
- Baby, you're overreacting. OK?

75
00:05:59,385 --> 00:06:03,542
Don't do that! Don't you do that!
Don't diminish my needs.

76
00:06:03,609 --> 00:06:06,512
Sweetheart, I don't have a choice.
I gotta go.

77
00:06:06,586 --> 00:06:10,067
- I go down there, I come right back.
- "I, I, I, I, I!"

78
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:13,271
I wonder what the group
would have to say about that.

79
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:17,334
No. You cannot use that against me!
We are not even married, but I go.

80
00:06:17,404 --> 00:06:19,292
The group thinks we're married.

81
00:06:19,356 --> 00:06:22,739
I accepted the potato slicer
for our anniversary.

82
00:06:22,814 --> 00:06:24,637
Right, sweets? I go along.

83
00:06:24,734 --> 00:06:28,958
That's it. That is it.
You... You... You go along!

84
00:06:29,023 --> 00:06:33,302
You don't want to get married.
And this is the way you deal with it!

85
00:06:33,376 --> 00:06:36,224
Huh? You're back to
the same old selfish,

86
00:06:36,321 --> 00:06:39,289
self-involved, vile, disgusting...

87
00:06:39,362 --> 00:06:40,988
- Oh, God. You are...
- ..self!

88
00:06:41,058 --> 00:06:45,282
You're missing the grand design here!
If I don't go, I'm dead.

89
00:06:45,347 --> 00:06:48,217
Yeah. And it's difficult
to have a relationship

90
00:06:48,292 --> 00:06:50,748
if I'm stuffed with formaldehyde.

91
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:55,394
- Now, if anyone is being selfish...
- Oh! Now you blame-shift?

92
00:06:55,462 --> 00:06:58,496
- You are blame shifting?
- Stop analyzing!

93
00:06:58,567 --> 00:07:00,093
I'm calling a time-out!

94
00:07:00,998 --> 00:07:02,014
Ah!

95
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:14,239
All right...

96
00:07:14,346 --> 00:07:17,510
Jerry, I want you to acknowledge...

97
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:20,646
that my needs mean nothing to you
and you're selfish.

98
00:07:20,748 --> 00:07:23,913
- Oh, my God!
- Jerry, acknowledge.

99
00:07:23,981 --> 00:07:27,145
I... OK.

100
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:31,916
I will acknowledge that I promised
I would go to Vegas with you.

101
00:07:31,982 --> 00:07:34,372
But now we're just slightly delayed.

102
00:07:34,447 --> 00:07:41,040
If you want to construe my wanting
to stay alive as being selfish, OK.

103
00:07:41,136 --> 00:07:45,894
I have every intention of going with
you. Your needs are important to me.

104
00:07:47,954 --> 00:07:52,297
Come on. Look at all my stuff here,
all over the pavement.

105
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:55,601
Come on, baby. Huh?

106
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:01,429
What do you say?

107
00:08:01,493 --> 00:08:03,915
OK?

108
00:08:06,359 --> 00:08:08,814
I'm going with or without you, Jerry.

109
00:08:11,864 --> 00:08:13,424
What's it gonna be?

110
00:08:15,608 --> 00:08:18,511
- A bastard!
- A bastard.

111
00:08:18,585 --> 00:08:21,750
What happened to, uh,
"sweetheart" and "big love"?

112
00:08:21,818 --> 00:08:24,600
All those things
you called me last night?

113
00:08:24,667 --> 00:08:27,635
The only thing I'm interested
in calling you is a cab!

114
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:40,565
(Singing in Spanish)

115
00:08:50,401 --> 00:08:54,331
(Automated telephone
instructions in Spanish)

116
00:08:57,891 --> 00:09:01,787
Excuse me, speak English?
Excuse me, you speak English?

117
00:09:01,859 --> 00:09:04,065
- (Speaking Spanish)
- What?

118
00:09:05,092 --> 00:09:06,587
All set, Mr. Welbach.

119
00:09:06,661 --> 00:09:10,273
If you go to the front,
a shuttle will take you to your car.

120
00:09:10,374 --> 00:09:13,822
- What kind of car is it?
- It's a Chrysler. Brand-new.

121
00:09:13,894 --> 00:09:15,782
Yeah.

122
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:17,822
Is there a problem, Mr. Welbach?

123
00:09:17,896 --> 00:09:21,759
You know, it's my first trip
to Mexico and...a Chrysler?

124
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:24,135
I mean,
I drive a Chrysler in America.

125
00:09:24,201 --> 00:09:28,642
I thought you might have something
more authentic, a little more...

126
00:09:28,746 --> 00:09:32,227
- Mexican?
- You know, get into the spirit?

127
00:09:32,299 --> 00:09:34,404
- Your first time?
- Yeah.

128
00:09:34,475 --> 00:09:35,970
Wow. Exciting.

129
00:09:36,044 --> 00:09:38,412
(In Spanish)
Do you speak Spanish, Mr. Welbach?

130
00:09:38,476 --> 00:09:40,135
Huh?

131
00:09:40,365 --> 00:09:43,300
(In Spanish) I didn't think so. Just
what you learned on Speedy Gonzales?

132
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:45,229
Yeah, Speedy Gonzales.

133
00:09:45,295 --> 00:09:48,109
Let's see what we can do for you.

134
00:09:48,176 --> 00:09:50,315
Oh, I think I have just the thing.

135
00:09:51,343 --> 00:09:55,142
How would you like...an El Camino?!

136
00:09:55,217 --> 00:09:57,126
Ooh! I like that. Yeah.

137
00:09:57,233 --> 00:10:00,812
(In Spanish) You're going to get
into a lot of trouble here, sir.

138
00:10:00,882 --> 00:10:01,831
Raoul!

139
00:10:04,882 --> 00:10:07,218
(In Spanish)
Who wants him, a two-dayer?

140
00:10:08,371 --> 00:10:10,991
He looks like a lead foot
and a brake rider.

141
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,189
No. At the count of three.

142
00:10:14,741 --> 00:10:17,873
Uno... Dos... Tres...

143
00:10:33,369 --> 00:10:35,158
(Engine revving)

144
00:10:37,306 --> 00:10:40,952
Yeah, man. El Camino!

145
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:52,019
# El Camino excellente,
El Camino excellente... #

146
00:11:02,113 --> 00:11:03,935
(Woman speaking Spanish)

147
00:11:27,719 --> 00:11:29,061
# El Camino...

148
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,270
# In my El Camino... #

149
00:11:53,388 --> 00:11:55,047
(Truck horn blares)

150
00:12:02,831 --> 00:12:04,173
(Fuck me.)

151
00:13:03,613 --> 00:13:05,436
Fucker.

152
00:13:20,034 --> 00:13:22,010
(Chatter and fireworks popping)

153
00:14:04,813 --> 00:14:07,050
You are in the wrong place, America.

154
00:14:07,117 --> 00:14:09,703
Yeah, I'm aware of that.

155
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,837
What you want here?

156
00:14:13,903 --> 00:14:16,621
Uh...tequila.

157
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:24,940
I asked because no one like you...

158
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:27,114
comes to this place.

159
00:14:27,217 --> 00:14:29,192
It's death, this town.

160
00:14:30,642 --> 00:14:33,938
Only farmers...and bandidos.

161
00:14:36,051 --> 00:14:38,670
And I don't see a hoe.

162
00:14:40,821 --> 00:14:42,676
You a bandido, America?

163
00:14:44,566 --> 00:14:49,007
Uh, no. Uh, actually
I'm looking for a Señor Beck.

164
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,098
Señor Beck?

165
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:03,639
Right.

166
00:15:12,925 --> 00:15:14,071
OK?

167
00:15:20,382 --> 00:15:22,423
(Football commentary on TV)

168
00:15:27,136 --> 00:15:29,821
- You Beck?
- (Men jeer)

169
00:15:29,889 --> 00:15:33,883
- I know who you are.
- Good. That makes things easier.

170
00:15:33,954 --> 00:15:37,752
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- (Beck speaking Spanish)

171
00:15:39,107 --> 00:15:42,653
- We cool?
- You're all the same.

172
00:15:42,723 --> 00:15:44,547
Prepared.

173
00:15:46,565 --> 00:15:48,736
This ain't America. You want a drink?

174
00:15:50,886 --> 00:15:52,927
- Yeah, all right.
- Sit down.

175
00:15:56,135 --> 00:15:57,924
Somebody using this chair?

176
00:16:10,603 --> 00:16:12,458
I guess you wanna see it, right?

177
00:16:12,523 --> 00:16:14,890
- Yeah.
- You want to see it, don't you?

178
00:16:14,955 --> 00:16:17,257
Yeah. I'm afraid I'm gonna have to.

179
00:16:23,758 --> 00:16:25,252
Hey.

180
00:16:25,326 --> 00:16:28,676
You know what? Come with me.

181
00:16:33,968 --> 00:16:35,724
Sorry. Sorry.

182
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:44,168
This is what they call The Mexican.

183
00:16:46,386 --> 00:16:49,290
Wow. Yeah, that's pretty.

184
00:16:49,364 --> 00:16:51,568
Are you shitting me?
"Yeah, it's pretty."

185
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:53,644
- Can I?
- Uh-huh.

186
00:16:53,716 --> 00:16:58,452
It was made for a rich landowner,
a nobleman,

187
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,907
by a poor Mexican gunsmith.

188
00:17:00,983 --> 00:17:04,497
He fashioned this gun as a gift
to go along with the hopes

189
00:17:04,568 --> 00:17:08,878
that the nobleman's son would take
his daughter's hand in marriage.

190
00:17:13,914 --> 00:17:17,046
(Beck) 'The townspeople
waited three months

191
00:17:17,114 --> 00:17:19,864
'to catch the first glimpse
of the pistol.

192
00:17:22,012 --> 00:17:23,768
'Finally, the day had come.

193
00:17:23,868 --> 00:17:27,349
'No one had ever laid eyes
on a more beautiful gun.

194
00:17:29,309 --> 00:17:31,316
'It was all they thought it'd be.

195
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:35,449
'Some even thought
it was too beautiful to look at.

196
00:17:40,544 --> 00:17:43,676
'It was considered
to be an honor and good luck

a newly fashioned gun.

(Church bell chiming)

203
00:18:40,526 --> 00:18:44,684
Legend has it
that it's been cursed ever since.

204
00:18:44,751 --> 00:18:49,935
But it hasn't harmed me any though,
you know? I... I love to look at it.

205
00:18:51,729 --> 00:18:56,007
(Let me show you something.
Look, there's a bullet in there.)

206
00:18:56,114 --> 00:18:59,793
(It's handmade. Hand-fucking-made.)

207
00:19:01,939 --> 00:19:05,323
You don't even want to know
what this gun is worth.

208
00:19:13,943 --> 00:19:16,364
We could sell that gun, man.

209
00:19:16,438 --> 00:19:20,117
It's... It's a great fucking gun.

210
00:19:20,184 --> 00:19:23,894
And I'm not just talking shit either.

211
00:19:23,961 --> 00:19:28,502
You don't have to be a... Fuck.

212
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:32,149
I've been pissin' on myself. Fuck.

213
00:19:32,219 --> 00:19:35,700
Anyway, the old man
is nothing to be afraid of.

214
00:19:35,772 --> 00:19:38,904
As a matter of fact,
last week I told him to fuck off.

215
00:19:38,973 --> 00:19:41,723
- Yeah, you did!
- That's what I said too!

216
00:19:41,789 --> 00:19:46,165
I said, "Fuck off, Margolese,
you old prune shit-ass! If you..."

217
00:19:52,992 --> 00:19:54,934
Come on, fella. Get up. Huh?

218
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,576
Man, you're soaked in your own urine.
Don't make me carry you.

219
00:19:59,649 --> 00:20:01,438
Hey!

220
00:20:01,538 --> 00:20:03,610
Ah, this is my life.

221
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,595
All right.

222
00:20:15,237 --> 00:20:17,092
Yeah, baby. I got the touch.

223
00:20:18,245 --> 00:20:20,733
- (Groans)
- Oh!

224
00:20:20,806 --> 00:20:22,912
Buddy, you whacked your noggin!

225
00:20:24,006 --> 00:20:25,534
Hey.

226
00:20:26,824 --> 00:20:28,351
Oh, f...

227
00:20:29,993 --> 00:20:31,368
Ooh.

228
00:20:36,746 --> 00:20:37,956
Hey, man. Hey.

229
00:20:39,979 --> 00:20:41,801
Oh, shit!

230
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,228
Oh, shit!

231
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:58,411
Stop that! Stop!

232
00:20:59,439 --> 00:21:01,294
Christ!

233
00:21:04,369 --> 00:21:06,344
I found the gun.

234
00:21:06,417 --> 00:21:08,392
'The gun is in your possession?'

235
00:21:08,466 --> 00:21:11,434
As we speak.
But, like I said, there's, uh...

236
00:21:11,538 --> 00:21:13,513
There's a problem.

237
00:21:13,586 --> 00:21:17,002
What? You lost the kid? He's a souse,
he'll be in another bar.

238
00:21:17,076 --> 00:21:21,811
The kid's dead, Ted.
Ted, are you hearing me?

239
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:26,325
Yeah. I-I heard you.

240
00:21:27,382 --> 00:21:28,943
How?

241
00:21:29,015 --> 00:21:31,186
Bad luck, act of God, fuck if I know.

242
00:21:31,255 --> 00:21:34,158
All these maniacs shooting
guns up into the sky.

243
00:21:34,232 --> 00:21:38,226
It's Independence Day or something.
The kid got tagged by a loose one.

244
00:21:38,296 --> 00:21:41,526
Right in the fuckin' head.
I mean... Fu...

245
00:21:41,593 --> 00:21:43,830
He's dead! The kid's dead.

246
00:21:43,898 --> 00:21:47,215
The little fucker's in my car
right now, dead.

247
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:51,154
Geez, Jerry,
that's not a little problem.

248
00:21:51,229 --> 00:21:53,465
- 'That's a big problem.'
- I know.

249
00:21:53,564 --> 00:21:57,078
Jerry, that little fucker
is Margolese's grandson.

250
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,801
What? What?

251
00:21:59,871 --> 00:22:02,424
'Geez, you really
fucked it this time.'

252
00:22:02,495 --> 00:22:06,358
What did I have to do with it? One
minute he's pissin', next he's dead.

253
00:22:06,432 --> 00:22:07,959
'Don't even move.'

254
00:22:08,032 --> 00:22:09,756
I'll phone the office now.

255
00:22:09,825 --> 00:22:12,673
I'll get me on a plane
and straighten shit out.

256
00:22:12,768 --> 00:22:16,829
Ted, you gotta get word to the old
man. I didn't know who he was.

257
00:22:16,899 --> 00:22:20,576
- OK. Just sit tight, Jerry.
- (Crackling)

258
00:22:20,643 --> 00:22:24,256
- Hello?
- Ted? Ted? Hello?

Hey! Wait!

262

Oh, no!

263
00:22:58,829 --> 00:23:00,804

313
00:27:02,214 --> 00:27:04,670
Um, um... Sir?

314
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:08,199
- Can you stop the car? Please.
- Why?

315
00:27:12,073 --> 00:27:14,888
- I'm gonna be sick.
- Just open...

316
00:27:33,133 --> 00:27:36,996
She told me, "Don't go. I don't want
you on that highway alone."

317
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:40,716
I said, "It'll be fine, Mom.
It'll be OK." But it's not, is it?

318
00:27:40,816 --> 00:27:43,237
- I'm dead.
- Well, you're not dead.

319
00:27:43,312 --> 00:27:47,504
You would have been dead
if I hadn't saved your life.

320
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:50,221
Would you rather
it was you back there?

321
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:52,430
I didn't think so.

322
00:27:55,956 --> 00:27:57,931
Are you gonna kill me?

323
00:27:59,253 --> 00:28:01,904
Depends on
too many variables to answer.

324
00:28:04,469 --> 00:28:06,292
Are you gonna rape me?

325
00:28:07,831 --> 00:28:09,587
That's not likely, no.

326
00:28:10,934 --> 00:28:12,528
Well, what do you want?

327
00:28:13,879 --> 00:28:16,302
I suspect the same thing
as the other guy.

328
00:28:17,656 --> 00:28:19,544
The pistol.

329
00:28:20,569 --> 00:28:24,881
The one that Jerry's havin' a hard
time coming back from Mexico with.

330
00:28:24,955 --> 00:28:26,001
Jerry?

331
00:28:26,074 --> 00:28:30,266
I work for Bernie Nayman,
who works for Arnold Margolese.

332
00:28:30,332 --> 00:28:33,432
- You heard of these people.
- Yeah, I have.

333
00:28:33,501 --> 00:28:36,218
- And your husband works for 'em.
- No.

334
00:28:36,285 --> 00:28:38,107
Well, he does.

335
00:28:38,173 --> 00:28:42,004
I know the selfish, no-good liar
works for them. He isn't my husband.

336
00:28:42,078 --> 00:28:46,717
Well, whatever he is to you,
Jerry is in the shit books.

337
00:28:46,784 --> 00:28:51,640
When you're in as much shit as he is,
you get skittish about your future.

338
00:28:51,712 --> 00:28:53,435
Clouds your judgement.

339
00:28:53,505 --> 00:28:56,734
There's a lot of people
interested in that gun.

340
00:28:56,834 --> 00:28:58,623
So what we got here is a...

341
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:03,546
"he who controls the girl,
controls the pistol" situation.

342
00:29:03,652 --> 00:29:07,678
I'm a hostage? You blew that guy
to pieces for a fucking gun?

343
00:29:07,748 --> 00:29:09,505
This is so Jerry. Look...

344
00:29:09,573 --> 00:29:11,842
Sit down. Sit down.

345
00:29:11,909 --> 00:29:14,758
Um...

346
00:29:14,854 --> 00:29:16,710
Uh, uh...

347
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:19,297
Look.

348
00:29:19,367 --> 00:29:23,012
Jerry and I broke up,
so if he's doing...

349
00:29:24,105 --> 00:29:27,619
I don't know what he's doing.
It's got nothing to do with me.

350
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:32,073
You seem like a very nice girl.

351
00:29:32,138 --> 00:29:34,081
Thank you.

352
00:29:34,155 --> 00:29:38,313
But it's a fact,
in these life-threatening situations,

353
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:40,933
human beings...lie.

354
00:29:42,316 --> 00:29:44,324
So you are gonna kill me.

355
00:29:46,318 --> 00:29:49,133
All right, look.

356
00:29:49,198 --> 00:29:53,094
If everything goes OK and Jerry comes
through without this getting funky,

357
00:29:53,167 --> 00:29:55,110
I don't think that'll happen.

358
00:29:55,184 --> 00:29:57,290
He gives me the pistol,
I give you to him.

359
00:29:58,609 --> 00:30:02,766
I'm just here
to regulate funkiness. OK?

360
00:30:03,762 --> 00:30:04,940
Go on.

361
00:30:11,572 --> 00:30:12,717
Great.

362
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:18,770
(Donkey braying)

363
00:30:21,078 --> 00:30:23,314
Hyah. Hyah!

364
00:30:23,383 --> 00:30:24,757
Hyah!

365
00:30:28,343 --> 00:30:32,119
Come on, buddy. Come on, OK?
Just you and me. Yeah.

366
00:30:32,185 --> 00:30:33,745
Go!

367
00:30:34,777 --> 00:30:37,560
Go. Oh! You're such an ass.

368
00:30:37,658 --> 00:30:39,633
What are you...? No, no, no!

369
00:30:39,707 --> 00:30:41,714
I'm sorry! I didn't mean...

370
00:30:41,786 --> 00:30:43,161
Fuck!

371
00:30:44,188 --> 00:30:45,814
Fuck!

372
00:30:49,661 --> 00:30:50,906
(Horn)

373
00:30:51,965 --> 00:30:53,013
Hey!

374
00:30:55,358 --> 00:30:57,693
- ¿Que pasa?
- Buenas noches.

375
00:30:57,759 --> 00:31:01,240
- Buenas noches.
- I need a lift to the next town.

376
00:31:01,312 --> 00:31:04,029
(Speaking Spanish)

377
00:31:04,097 --> 00:31:08,767
I need a ride
in your automobile to the next town.

378
00:31:08,866 --> 00:31:12,281
I can't pay you.
I have no money. No dinero.

379
00:31:12,354 --> 00:31:14,143
- De Niro?
- Sí. None.

380
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:15,356
Robert De Niro?

381
00:31:16,804 --> 00:31:18,626
Robert De Niro!

382
00:31:18,692 --> 00:31:23,963
Yeah. Uh, I need a lift
in your el truck-o

383
00:31:24,069 --> 00:31:25,924
to the next town-o.

384
00:31:25,989 --> 00:31:30,082
- Uh, village-o. Uh, uh, pueblo.
- Ah, pueblo.

385
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:32,517
- Yeah, sí!
- Al otro pueblo. OK.

386
00:31:32,583 --> 00:31:34,492
- Yes?
- Señor De Niro!

387
00:31:39,785 --> 00:31:43,616
Self-winding. You never have
to wind it. It's very fine.

388
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:47,466
Yeah. Shake like...
Perpetual calendar.

389
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:49,670
It's good.

390
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:54,246
Is this even gonna run?

391
00:31:54,316 --> 00:31:56,138
Yeah?

392
00:32:01,871 --> 00:32:03,277
Hey. That your ball?

393
00:32:04,526 --> 00:32:07,844
Shit. Hey. Hey, man.

394
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:09,894
You got a rabid dog back here.

395
00:32:09,968 --> 00:32:11,692
Go. Go!

396
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,095
Go. Out.

397
00:32:18,546 --> 00:32:21,547
You gotta do something
about this dog.

398
00:32:29,493 --> 00:32:33,836
(Operator) 'I have a collect call
for Samantha from Jerry Welbach.

399
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:36,977
- 'No one there, sir.'
- (Jerry) 'Give it a second.'

400
00:32:37,046 --> 00:32:40,659
Sam, pick up the phone.
Sams? Samsonite?

401
00:32:40,727 --> 00:32:42,517
Baby, please don't do this.

402
00:32:42,584 --> 00:32:44,723
- 'Please try again, sir'
- No!

403
00:32:44,793 --> 00:32:47,160
Just give it a second. She's there...

404
00:33:13,567 --> 00:33:15,455
What are you doing?

405
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,976
- You're gonna make a call.
- To whom?

406
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,804
To Jerry.

407
00:33:19,905 --> 00:33:23,354
You're gonna tell him that Leroy
is with you then you hang up.

408
00:33:23,426 --> 00:33:26,208
- Leroy?
- Yeah. Leroy, that's right.

409
00:33:26,306 --> 00:33:28,478
Then you're gonna hang up. Simple.

410
00:33:28,547 --> 00:33:30,403
That's it?

411
00:33:30,499 --> 00:33:32,442
It's enough. Believe me.

412
00:33:37,925 --> 00:33:41,122
You gonna make the call
or do I have to make you? Cos I will.

413
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:43,646
- No. I'll call.
- Good.

414
00:33:45,319 --> 00:33:47,524
Dial it.

415
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:50,691
OK. What's the number?

416
00:33:51,944 --> 00:33:53,768
You have the number.

417
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:58,471
I don't know where he is.
You should have the number.

418
00:33:58,537 --> 00:34:03,012
What are you tellin' me? You don't
have a number, a motel, nothing?

419
00:34:03,115 --> 00:34:07,306
What's the matter, don't you listen?
We broke up. No longer together.

420
00:34:07,373 --> 00:34:09,348
Why would I have the number?

421
00:34:20,944 --> 00:34:23,311
I'm sensing you have trust issues.

422
00:34:25,232 --> 00:34:27,207
You got one minute.

423
00:34:44,437 --> 00:34:47,285
I'm a professional.
I do this for a living.

424
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:49,325
Goody for you.

425
00:34:58,168 --> 00:35:00,111
You're wasting your time.

426
00:35:01,754 --> 00:35:05,748
(Radio) # You're nobody
till somebody loves you... #

427
00:35:05,818 --> 00:35:07,924
I think I believe you.

428
00:35:09,019 --> 00:35:14,966
# You're nobody
till somebody cares...

429
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:16,954
What's in Vegas?

430
00:35:21,469 --> 00:35:27,135
Uh, well...I'm gonna be a waitress,
then make a career as a croupier.

431
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:32,187
They can make $100,000 a year but you
have to have the hands, which I do.

432
00:35:32,257 --> 00:35:35,104
I got them from Grandma Vega,
which is a good thing

433
00:35:35,169 --> 00:35:38,399
cos my Granny Barzel
had hands like a circus midget.

434
00:35:38,466 --> 00:35:40,637
How come you can't live with Jerry?

435
00:35:42,083 --> 00:35:43,839
Do you know Jerry?

436
00:35:45,379 --> 00:35:49,439
He has trouble expressing feelings.
He had a fucked-up childhood.

437
00:35:49,541 --> 00:35:54,113
His mom is nuts. One of those people
who thinks the iron is always on.

438
00:35:54,181 --> 00:35:58,405
- Don't you love him?
- I think that's the problem.

439
00:35:58,471 --> 00:36:00,805
We love each other too much.

440
00:36:00,871 --> 00:36:02,760
But he's... He's so selfish.

441
00:36:02,856 --> 00:36:05,605
It's like we've been living
his life forever.

442
00:36:05,673 --> 00:36:10,049
He'd tell you a different story,
but I give and he just keeps taking.

443
00:36:10,154 --> 00:36:13,602
Our counselor totally
agrees with me, by the way.

444
00:36:13,674 --> 00:36:16,642
I don't put much stock
in those counselor types.

445
00:36:16,748 --> 00:36:19,595
All they do is sit around
and smoke joints.

446
00:36:19,659 --> 00:36:22,530
Maybe, but Jerry is still a taker
and I'm a giver.

447
00:36:22,605 --> 00:36:24,514
It's obvious.

448
00:36:24,588 --> 00:36:27,240
A lot of people
are under the impression

449
00:36:27,342 --> 00:36:29,546
that you get to choose who you love.

450
00:36:30,575 --> 00:36:33,128
I'm sorry, are you...

451
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:36,297
Are you taking his side?
You're a man, of course.

452
00:36:36,367 --> 00:36:40,940
- You're taking his side.
- You love him. You said so yourself.

453
00:36:41,009 --> 00:36:43,376
It's all that matters.

454
00:36:46,738 --> 00:36:49,739
You're a very sensitive person
for a killer.

455
00:36:51,699 --> 00:36:53,643
Thank you, Sam.

456
00:37:15,417 --> 00:37:16,792
Shit.

457
00:37:23,899 --> 00:37:26,137
Get. Get out. Out.

458
00:37:26,204 --> 00:37:28,593
Look, you gotta get out.

459
00:37:28,669 --> 00:37:30,458
Get out!

460
00:37:42,816 --> 00:37:44,672
(Muttering)

461
00:37:50,817 --> 00:37:52,345
Go!

462
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:00,383
(Truck horn blaring)

463
00:38:06,245 --> 00:38:08,188
(Speaking Spanish)

464
00:38:11,111 --> 00:38:13,567
Hola, shithead! Where's my stuff?

465
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,582
Get back! Where's my stuff?

466
00:38:15,656 --> 00:38:19,551
- Pistol. Pistolero. Get back.
- La pistola.

467
00:38:21,033 --> 00:38:22,756
Get back!

468
00:38:22,825 --> 00:38:24,931
Stay calm. Get back, get back!

469
00:38:25,866 --> 00:38:29,544
Don't move.
What the f...? Give me those.

470
00:38:30,604 --> 00:38:32,676
Back! Back, back.

471
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:35,977
Get in the car. Get in! OK.

472
00:38:36,044 --> 00:38:38,411
Is that my...? Is that my jacket?

473
00:38:38,477 --> 00:38:43,628
Put it in the car! What is wrong
with you people? Get back!

474
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:09,876
- (Sam) You don't have to be in here.
- I go by track record.

475
00:39:09,941 --> 00:39:14,349
- I don't hear any tinkle, tinkle.
- Stage fright.

476
00:39:14,421 --> 00:39:17,106
Look around,
there's not even a window.

477
00:39:18,327 --> 00:39:22,801
So what's with this "We've been
livin' his life forever" thing?

478
00:39:22,872 --> 00:39:24,760
I didn't mean it literally.

479
00:39:24,824 --> 00:39:28,655
Jerry's been working for Margolese
for five years less a day.

480
00:39:28,729 --> 00:39:30,672
It just feels lifelong.

481
00:39:30,746 --> 00:39:33,080
- Sounds like jail terms.
- It is.

482
00:39:33,146 --> 00:39:37,009
Arnold Margolese is in jail
because Jerry put him there.

483
00:39:39,739 --> 00:39:42,610
Jerry ratted out Arnold Margolese?

484
00:39:42,685 --> 00:39:47,061
No. Jerry was coming across Ventura,
over there by Laurel Canyon.

485
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:49,622
- Yeah?
- He wasn't paying attention,

486
00:39:49,694 --> 00:39:53,077
ran a red light,
smashed into Margolese's Cadillac.

487
00:39:53,151 --> 00:39:58,106
The cops came, Margolese got busted
cos he had a person in the trunk.

488
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:00,795
That's how Margolese
got sent to jail? !

489
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:02,240
Mm-hmm.

490
00:40:04,129 --> 00:40:07,032
- Live person or dead person?
- Live person.

491
00:40:07,107 --> 00:40:09,693
Huh. What's the big deal, then?

492
00:40:09,827 --> 00:40:12,381
He probably wasn't
gonna stay that way.

493
00:40:12,452 --> 00:40:15,486
He was taped up in a trunk
for a reason, wasn't he?

494
00:40:15,557 --> 00:40:18,905
I would think this was
right up your alley, Swifty.

495
00:40:20,838 --> 00:40:24,068
- He saw something?
- Whatever it was this guy saw,

496
00:40:24,135 --> 00:40:26,983
or was going to say to the cops,
he got the chance.

497
00:40:27,047 --> 00:40:31,521
Since it was Jerry's fault, Margolese
had him work off the jail time.

498
00:40:31,624 --> 00:40:34,472
My whole relationship
has been hijacked

499
00:40:34,537 --> 00:40:37,855
because he doesn't pay attention
when he drives.

500
00:40:39,882 --> 00:40:42,272
I... I can't go with you in here.

501
00:40:53,294 --> 00:40:55,083
(Urinating)

502
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:59,013
(Sam urinating)

503
00:41:01,231 --> 00:41:05,030
(Man) We didn't think we were getting
a dead man with the car.

504
00:41:05,105 --> 00:41:07,723
I got no use for a dead gringo.
Take a left.

505
00:41:21,684 --> 00:41:23,474
(Flies buzzing)

506
00:41:30,358 --> 00:41:32,246
Come on.

507
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:40,022
If you're going to kill me,
at least tell me

508
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:42,609
who it is that's going
to send me to God.

509
00:41:43,769 --> 00:41:45,079
Tell me!

510
00:41:46,842 --> 00:41:48,631
Look, I'm not gonna kill you.

511
00:41:51,035 --> 00:41:53,141
But I am gonna have to shoot you.

512
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,668
But why, sir? Why?

513
00:41:56,732 --> 00:41:58,707
Why? Because you stole from me,

514
00:41:58,781 --> 00:42:01,749
you know about the pistol
and you'll steal again.

515
00:42:01,822 --> 00:42:04,856
I can't have you coming back
like a fly in the ointment.

516
00:42:04,926 --> 00:42:07,479
I won't be a fly!
You'll never see me again.

517
00:42:07,551 --> 00:42:09,275
You're gettin' shot, that's it.

518
00:42:09,344 --> 00:42:12,541
It'll take time to walk to town,
especially limping...

519
00:42:12,608 --> 00:42:14,201
Wait, wait. Limping?

520
00:42:14,272 --> 00:42:18,071
Can't you just tie me up some more?
Fuck! You shoot me? Tie me!

521
00:42:18,146 --> 00:42:20,448
Yeah. I don't have a rope.

522
00:42:20,514 --> 00:42:22,140
So you shoot me?

523
00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:25,081
It's the American way.

524
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:29,115
Where do you want it?

525
00:42:32,102 --> 00:42:33,149
OK.

526
00:42:33,254 --> 00:42:37,445
Not the leg! There's arteries.
I could bleed to death in seconds.

527
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:38,754
The foot.

528
00:42:40,295 --> 00:42:44,092
That's fair where I come from. OK?
It'll hurt, but it'll heal.

529
00:42:44,168 --> 00:42:46,535
What if you take off a fucking toe!

530
00:42:46,601 --> 00:42:48,838
Wait, wait, wait. Not the left.

531
00:42:48,905 --> 00:42:51,077
Oh, sorry.

532
00:42:51,146 --> 00:42:53,449
On the count of three.

533
00:42:53,515 --> 00:42:56,417
- One...
- (Screams)

534
00:42:56,491 --> 00:43:00,835
Look, I'm agreeing with you.
But there's a few ways to look at it.

535
00:43:00,908 --> 00:43:03,145
Sex is, no matter what anybody says,

536
00:43:03,277 --> 00:43:05,928
a very important part
of any relationship.

537
00:43:05,997 --> 00:43:09,511
The fact that Jerry
is a considerate lover says a lot.

538
00:43:11,567 --> 00:43:14,829
- You lost me.
- Well, he's a considerate lover.

539
00:43:14,895 --> 00:43:19,305
You gotta find a way to get him to
expand this quality he has during sex

540
00:43:19,376 --> 00:43:21,766
to other areas of your relationship.

541
00:43:21,873 --> 00:43:25,223
Even if it only comes out in sex,
it's there just the same.

542
00:43:27,218 --> 00:43:29,641
That's a good point.

543
00:43:29,715 --> 00:43:34,125
If a person's a considerate lover,
he can't be all selfish, right?

544
00:43:36,821 --> 00:43:38,577
Unless of course he's...

545
00:43:43,926 --> 00:43:47,856
- He's, uh, being a considerate...
- What was that?

546
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,025
What?

547
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,255
That. That moment you had.

548
00:43:55,417 --> 00:43:57,752
What moment?

549
00:43:58,874 --> 00:44:02,224
Leroy, you just checked out
that guy and had a moment.

550
00:44:02,299 --> 00:44:04,634
That was a moment.

551
00:44:07,868 --> 00:44:09,877
I don't know if it was a moment.

552
00:44:11,164 --> 00:44:12,725
(Are you gay?)

553
00:44:15,006 --> 00:44:18,072
- As in happy?
- As in homosexual.

554
00:44:20,575 --> 00:44:24,504
What does my sexual orientation
have to do with our conversation?

555
00:44:24,576 --> 00:44:26,169
Nothing.

556
00:44:26,272 --> 00:44:30,529
Nothing. Except something that you
said back there really bugged me

557
00:44:30,594 --> 00:44:33,343
and this would kind of
help it make sense.

558
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:35,931
Yeah? What's that?

559
00:44:36,003 --> 00:44:39,299
I asked if you were gonna rape me,
you said, "Not likely."

560
00:44:39,363 --> 00:44:41,851
You said it so coldly,
like I was repulsive

561
00:44:41,924 --> 00:44:46,235
and it was ludicrous to think I was
actually at risk of being raped.

562
00:44:47,813 --> 00:44:51,676
First of all, it's a crime of anger,
not attraction.

563
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:56,159
Second of all, you're not repulsive.
You're very beautiful.

564
00:44:56,232 --> 00:44:58,055
Thank you.

565
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:00,542
- You want me to rape you?
- Are you gay?

566
00:45:00,617 --> 00:45:03,203
- You want me to rape you?
- You're gay.

567
00:45:04,394 --> 00:45:06,401
You're gay. I knew it!

568
00:45:06,506 --> 00:45:09,322
Oh, I so knew it.
I just knew it. What a relief.

569
00:45:09,387 --> 00:45:13,894
Do you want a medal? A little trinket
saying you identified a homosexual?

570
00:45:13,964 --> 00:45:16,299
No.

571
00:45:16,364 --> 00:45:18,187
Are you full throttle?

572
00:45:21,134 --> 00:45:22,695
Full throttle?

573
00:45:30,992 --> 00:45:32,880
Yeah, I guess I am.

574
00:45:32,945 --> 00:45:36,174
Oh. I'm not... I mean...

575
00:45:36,242 --> 00:45:39,723
I'm not trying to be a smart-ass
or anything like that.

576
00:45:39,795 --> 00:45:42,064
I just... I think this is great.

577
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:43,985
Wow. This is...

578
00:45:44,051 --> 00:45:47,281
This is...major, OK?

579
00:45:47,348 --> 00:45:51,506
I...know the kind of people
in your business, OK?

580
00:45:51,574 --> 00:45:55,698
- Yeah?
- And to me, it seems that...

581
00:45:55,766 --> 00:46:01,484
Well, being gay isn't really...
conducive to the environment.

582
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:06,610
Like I should be an interior
decorator. That's insulting.

583
00:46:06,712 --> 00:46:10,423
- I am very good at what I do.
- Do you have a boyfriend?

584
00:46:12,857 --> 00:46:14,614
No, I don't.

585
00:46:15,931 --> 00:46:19,477
Unfortunately,
I seem to be unable to keep...

586
00:46:19,547 --> 00:46:21,370
relationships together.

587
00:46:23,644 --> 00:46:28,119
Seems like everybody's having trouble
keeping relationships together.

588
00:47:02,181 --> 00:47:04,036
It's ringing, señor.

589
00:47:06,054 --> 00:47:09,536
- Thank you for that.
- No, no, no. No necesario.

590
00:47:09,608 --> 00:47:11,464
Really?

591
00:47:13,352 --> 00:47:15,905
That's so kind.
You have no idea what...

592
00:47:15,976 --> 00:47:18,083
'Hi, this is Ted. Leave a message.

593
00:47:18,154 --> 00:47:20,521
'If this is my guy in need,
I'm on my way.

594
00:47:20,586 --> 00:47:24,416
'Go to the Hotel de la Plaza.
Wait for me there, OK? Sit tight.'

595
00:47:24,522 --> 00:47:27,338
OK, OK. Forget aeropuerto.

596
00:47:27,403 --> 00:47:29,509
Uh, Hotel de la Plaza.

597
00:47:33,677 --> 00:47:36,645
- (Muttering in Spanish)
- Hola.

598
00:47:36,718 --> 00:47:38,955
- Is this your dog?
- Sort of.

599
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:41,389
Came along for the ride.

600
00:47:42,479 --> 00:47:45,350
He has a personality
and that does count.

601
00:47:45,425 --> 00:47:48,906
- He's a good guy.
- Is this your car?

602
00:47:48,978 --> 00:47:51,498
It's a rental. I'm an American.

603
00:47:51,569 --> 00:47:53,839
- No shit? Really?
- Yeah.

604
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:56,497
I'm Mexican.

605
00:47:58,515 --> 00:48:00,370
Cool.

606
00:48:00,501 --> 00:48:02,922
Do you have a passport?

607
00:48:09,334 --> 00:48:14,289
- Jerry Wellbatch, Los Angeles, USA.
- Welbach... Wellbatch.

608
00:48:16,279 --> 00:48:18,102
Can I ask you a question, Jerry?

609
00:48:20,024 --> 00:48:21,748
How long have you been in Mexico?

610
00:48:23,833 --> 00:48:27,380
- A few days. Pleasure.
- I see.

611
00:48:27,482 --> 00:48:29,905
- Pleasure, huh?
- Yeah.

612
00:48:29,979 --> 00:48:34,802
I see. Can you tell me,
uh, what happened here?

613
00:48:37,724 --> 00:48:40,409
That's not accurate, I'm afraid.

614
00:48:40,509 --> 00:48:44,602
The gunsmith did craft this pistol
for a prospective husband,

615
00:48:44,703 --> 00:48:47,191
and he was a nobleman's son, true.

616
00:48:47,295 --> 00:48:51,257
But the motif was darker, my friend.

617
00:48:51,328 --> 00:48:53,598
It's cursed, this gun.

618
00:48:57,154 --> 00:49:01,912
(Policeman) 'The key to this tale
involves the gunsmith's assistant,

619
00:49:03,011 --> 00:49:06,722
'a poor, but honorable
young man in blinding love

620
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:09,503
'with the gunsmith's daughter.

621
00:49:09,572 --> 00:49:13,402
'For months at a time,

622
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:15,615

00:49:20,327 --> 00:49:24,583
'only to discover that what he hoped
could be a wedding gift for him...

625
00:49:25,961 --> 00:49:27,619
'was for another.

626
00:49:27,721 --> 00:49:31,496
'The gunsmith insisted his daughter
marry the nobleman's son,

627
00:49:31,593 --> 00:49:33,864
'forbidding their love.

628
00:49:36,555 --> 00:49:40,200
'Angered in his bitter pain,
the assistant cursed the gun,

629
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:43,017
'vowing the creation
would never prevail.

630
00:49:47,726 --> 00:49:50,923
'But the gunsmith
was racing against time.

631
00:49:50,990 --> 00:49:54,471
'He had promised a pistol
of unparalleled craftsmanship,

632
00:49:54,543 --> 00:49:57,227
'the nobleman's dowry
hanging in the balance.

633
00:50:00,656 --> 00:50:05,327
'He worked day and night
to correct the pistol's problems.'

634
00:50:10,515 --> 00:50:12,490
(Bullet ricocheting)

635
00:50:24,246 --> 00:50:26,035
(Church bell chiming)

636
00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:30,930
This gun never worked properly.

637
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:35,125
Some say its very creation
ended the gunsmith's life.

638
00:50:44,762 --> 00:50:48,758
Well, my friend, you're free to go,
but without the gun.

639
00:50:48,828 --> 00:50:51,796
This gun doesn't belong
to you or to your boss.

640
00:50:51,870 --> 00:50:53,812
Now it belongs to me.

641
00:50:55,614 --> 00:50:59,095
(Man) Yeah, Vegas.
It can be tough that way.

642
00:50:59,327 --> 00:51:02,905
(Sam) Expensive?
(Man) Yeah, emotionally.

643
00:51:02,975 --> 00:51:05,343
I had a serious relationship problem.

644
00:51:05,409 --> 00:51:08,825
Well, you fit right in here.

645
00:51:09,089 --> 00:51:14,906
- What do you do now, Frank?
- Now...I am a postman.

646
00:51:14,978 --> 00:51:17,368
Get out of here.

647
00:51:17,444 --> 00:51:19,615
- That's so rigid.
- Swear to God.

648
00:51:19,716 --> 00:51:22,334
There's a seedy underbelly
to the postal service.

649
00:51:22,404 --> 00:51:24,990
- Is that the key to it?
- That's the key.

650
00:51:25,092 --> 00:51:27,329
You have no idea how many small,

651
00:51:27,397 --> 00:51:30,497
unmarked brown paper packages
I deliver.

652
00:51:30,566 --> 00:51:33,349
- What, porno?
- Yeah, daily.

653
00:51:33,415 --> 00:51:34,942
Like what?

654
00:51:35,015 --> 00:51:39,523
Videos, blow-up dolls,
dildos, pocket pussies.

655
00:51:39,656 --> 00:51:42,591
- Don't leave nothing out.
- Oh, yeah?

656
00:51:42,697 --> 00:51:46,560
But even with all that
dirty excitement at my fingertips,

657
00:51:46,634 --> 00:51:49,089
I still have to take off
once a year.

658
00:51:49,162 --> 00:51:53,768
I just get up and I know I'm going
to Vegas, I just don't know how.

659
00:51:53,836 --> 00:51:56,684
All I've got is my wallet
and an attitude.

660
00:51:58,445 --> 00:52:00,933
I don't know, it keeps me sane.

661
00:52:01,005 --> 00:52:04,519
After all, guns don't kill people...

662
00:52:04,590 --> 00:52:06,696
postal workers do.

663
00:52:31,029 --> 00:52:33,004
OK, you're all set, Mr. Shurker.

664
00:52:33,108 --> 00:52:36,011
If you go to the front,
a shuttle will pick you up.

665
00:52:36,118 --> 00:52:38,158
What kind of car is it exactly?

666
00:52:38,230 --> 00:52:40,140
It's a Chrysler, sir, brand-new.

667
00:52:40,246 --> 00:52:44,274
You wouldn't happen to have
something a little more...

668
00:52:44,375 --> 00:52:45,620
Raoul!

669
00:52:56,826 --> 00:52:58,615
Yeah, man!

670
00:52:58,747 --> 00:53:01,017
Yeah. Never fear, Teddy's here.

671
00:53:01,148 --> 00:53:03,352
How are you?

672
00:53:15,007 --> 00:53:17,592
- 'Rosco!'
- (Speaks Spanish)

673
00:53:17,663 --> 00:53:21,145
Come on, Jerry.
The Mexican thief, the dirty cop?

674
00:53:21,217 --> 00:53:23,836
The word is out.
It's a big-ticket item.

675
00:53:23,937 --> 00:53:27,287
A lot of fucking people
are interested in that gun.

676
00:53:29,026 --> 00:53:32,376
No fucking...
Is that what they think?

677
00:53:32,451 --> 00:53:34,339
That I'm selling them out?

678
00:53:34,404 --> 00:53:38,114
Maybe they think you're scared
and might do the wrong thing.

679
00:53:38,181 --> 00:53:40,221
- Ted.
- You know, I don't know.

680
00:53:40,357 --> 00:53:44,417
- I'm just doing my portion here.
- Yeah, and what is that?

681
00:53:44,486 --> 00:53:48,994
To find out what's going on, assess
the damage, try to calm you down,

682
00:53:49,064 --> 00:53:52,261
help find the pistol, get us home.

683
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:56,735
I get on that plane, pistol or not.
it'll be the last flight I ever take.

684
00:53:56,809 --> 00:53:59,940
- Oh, come on, Jerry.
- "Come on"? You know it.

685
00:54:00,010 --> 00:54:02,978
- I know what I have to know.
- Doing your part.

686
00:54:03,051 --> 00:54:04,807
I know what I have to know.

687
00:54:04,875 --> 00:54:07,593
You sound like Schultz
from Hogan's Heroes.

688
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:09,766
(German accent) I know nothing!

689
00:54:09,836 --> 00:54:12,651
I don't like Nayman
running things either.

690
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:16,579
I got a few years on you and I'm
telling you, keep your nose clean,

691
00:54:16,654 --> 00:54:19,557
look straight ahead
and do what you're told.

692
00:54:19,631 --> 00:54:23,788
That's why I nearly paid off
Boca Raton. I do my fuckin' portions.

693
00:54:25,649 --> 00:54:27,722
I don't care how you look at it,

694
00:54:27,793 --> 00:54:31,055
the first step out of this
is to get the pistol back.

695
00:54:32,081 --> 00:54:34,122
I never took a pay-off in my life.

696
00:54:34,195 --> 00:54:37,709
Jerry, look,
I know where your loyalties lie.

697
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:41,425
But the kid's dead.
The pistol's gone.

698
00:54:41,492 --> 00:54:44,340
I mean, you can see
how it looks, right?

699
00:54:44,404 --> 00:54:45,746
Come on.

700
00:54:47,477 --> 00:54:49,201
You're my guy.

701
00:54:53,591 --> 00:54:54,966
(Phone)

702
00:55:00,184 --> 00:55:02,224
(Ringing continues)

703
00:55:33,984 --> 00:55:37,879
# We can dance if we want to
we've got all your life and mine

704
00:55:37,985 --> 00:55:40,408
# As long as we abuse it,
never gonna lose it

705
00:55:40,482 --> 00:55:42,588
# Everything will work out right

706
00:55:42,659 --> 00:55:44,601
# I say, we can dance if we want to

707
00:55:44,675 --> 00:55:47,229
# We can leave your friends behind

708
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:50,596
# Cos your friends don't dance
and if they don't dance, well they're

709
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:52,286
# No friends of mine

710
00:55:52,389 --> 00:55:55,739
# I say, we can dance, we can dance,
everything's out of control

711
00:55:55,814 --> 00:55:58,814
# We can dance, we can dance

712
00:55:58,886 --> 00:56:01,059
# They're doing it from pole to pole

713
00:56:01,127 --> 00:56:04,772
# We can dance, we can dance,
everybody look at your hands... #

714
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:07,558
- (Music stops)
- Not the safest dance!

715
00:56:25,644 --> 00:56:28,012
I'm not going anywhere.

716
00:56:33,071 --> 00:56:36,420
(Sam) We are in the city
where I'm going to be living.

717
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:42,760
(Go.)

718
00:56:46,257 --> 00:56:47,435
Go.

719
00:56:50,035 --> 00:56:51,978
What's wrong? Huh?

720
00:56:55,476 --> 00:56:59,219
You know when you're in
a bad relationship and you separate?

721
00:56:59,317 --> 00:57:04,107
All of a sudden, everywhere you look
there's love and possibility.

722
00:57:08,342 --> 00:57:10,231
I'm worried about Jerry.

723
00:57:11,831 --> 00:57:13,621
All right, don't worry.

724
00:57:13,721 --> 00:57:16,470
I'll call Nayman
and check in on everything.

725
00:57:23,322 --> 00:57:25,265
You want me to stay?

726
00:57:28,507 --> 00:57:30,515
I want you to go.

727
00:57:30,621 --> 00:57:33,076
You sure?

728
00:57:34,269 --> 00:57:36,658
I really want you to go.

729
00:57:42,271 --> 00:57:44,247
(Clicking)

730
00:57:57,122 --> 00:57:58,879
(Snoring)

731
00:58:11,622 --> 00:58:13,859
(Ted) I couldn't sleep all night.

732
00:58:13,927 --> 00:58:19,395
Yeah. No, he said he followed
the cop to the pawn shop.

733
00:58:19,464 --> 00:58:22,279
He's taking me over there
after breakfast.

734
00:58:22,345 --> 00:58:26,175
We're booked on the seven o'clock
if all goes well.

735
00:58:26,249 --> 00:58:30,212
No, now wait... No...
No, you wait a minute, Nayman.

736
00:58:30,283 --> 00:58:33,699
Now what do you gotta go
and say that for?

737
00:58:33,772 --> 00:58:35,812
Well, now or later?

738
00:58:35,884 --> 00:58:38,634
How could I misinterpret?

739
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:42,498
No, you didn't send the wrong guy.
I'm handling things.

740
00:58:42,574 --> 00:58:44,679
But I never signed up for that.

741
00:58:44,750 --> 00:58:48,942
Listen, I promise you, when I tell
him, it'll make a difference.
