1
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,600
Help!

2
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,120
-Eddie
-What?

3
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,240
Eddie! Wake up!

4
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,440
-Don't move. Okay listen to me.
-Where are we?

5
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,520
-Whatever you do, don't lean forward.
-What's this? What's...

6
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,320
-What's going on?
-No!

7
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,200
<i>Hello. I want to play a game.</i>

8
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,920
<i>The devices on your heads are symbol
of the shackles that you place upon others.</i>

9
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,320
<i>You recklessly loan people money.
knowing their financial limitations.</i>

10
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,600
<i>counting on repossessing
more than they could ever pay back.</i>

11
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:26,360
<i>You are predators,
but today, you become the prey.</i>

12
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,080
<i>The scale before you
is your only path to freedom.</i>

13
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,880
<i>However, only one of you may pass,</i>

14
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:41,400
<i>and the toll is the ultimate sacrifice,</i>

15
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,640
<i>the sacrifice of flesh.</i>

16
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,280
<i>Before you are the instruments
to exact this flesh.</i>

17
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,840
<i>Move with haste, though,</i>

18
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,880
<i>for when the 60-second timer hits zero,</i>

19
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:57,240
<i>the one who has given the most flesh
will release their bindings,</i>

20
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:02,680
<i>while the gears on your opponent's head
will engage, piercing their skull.</i>

21
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,800
<i>Who will offer the most flesh
in order to save their life?</i>

22
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,440
<i>The choice is yours.</i>

23
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,480
No!

24
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm not dying for you, bitch!

25
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,520
No!

26
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,240
<i>I ask you. Special Agent Strahm.</i>

27
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,280
<i>have you learned enough to trust me?</i>

28
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,160
<i>For if you do not,
this room will forever be your tomb.</i>

29
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,400
<i>You will never be heard from again,
your body will never be found,</i>

30
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,680
<i>and my legacy will become yours.</i>

31
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,840
<i>Make your choice.</i>

32
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,480
There was a pre-existing condition,

33
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,200
which you did not inform
your insurance company of.

34
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,160
Thank you.

35
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:00,920
Hey, babe. Good. Listen, I am so, so sorry,
but I can't make dinner.

36
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:06,160
I've got to work late again.
Well, I've got to meet with legal,

37
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,440
and that's going to jam me up
for, certainly, the rest of the afternoon.

38
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:16,560
I know it's your birthday.
I'm going to make it up to you, I promise.

39
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,000
Love you.

40
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,120
-What were we talking about?
-We're talking about your deposition.

41
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,280
Don't worry about me, Debbie.

42
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,280
Some small-time lawyer
trying to squeeze us

43
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,240
is not gonna gat ma to say
anything I don't want to say.

44
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,520
I have no doubt about that,

45
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,840
but as lead counsel for this company,
if you screw up, it comes down on my ass.

46
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,800
So what do you say
we prep your deposition?

47
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,160
Christ.

48
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,200
Do you remember dealing
with a Mr. Harold Abbott?

49
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,440
William, I have a Casey Patterson on line 1.

50
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:49,080
Take another message, Addy.
I'll get back to her this week.

51
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,320
Some time. Keep going.

52
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,480
When opposing counsel asks you
about Mr. Abbott, how will you respond?

53
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,320
I am going to respond by saying,

54
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,160
as Senior Vice President
of Membership and Claims,

55
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,040
it is my job
to review every terminated policy.

56
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,600
As a matter of fact, Mr. Abbott
was sitting right where you are now

57
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,600
when we discussed his appeal.

58
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,440
I just... I don't get it.

59
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,320
I’ve been with this insurance company
for over 10 years.

60
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,520
I know, Harold. But, unfortunately,
when we reviewed your claim,

61
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,400
we discovered that you failed to mention
a previous condition.

62
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,080
What condition? There was no condition.

63
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,680
It says here you had oral surgery
to remove a cyst from your jaw.

64
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,680
This is absurd! I have heart disease.

65
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,480
It has nothing to do with some oral surgery
I had 30 years ago.

66
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,680
Any type of oral surgery
is going to leave scar tissue.

67
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,400
Scar tissue can lead to gum disease.

68
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,000
And, as you well know,
gum disease can cause heart disease.

69
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,280
You know what? You're... You're a criminal.

70
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,080
You are a goddamn criminal.

71
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,640
I paid my monthly premium for 10 years
without so much as a cold.

72
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,360
And now that I'm actually sick,
you're going to deny my coverage?

73
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,320
-I have a family!
-Those are the rules, Harold.

74
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,440
I'm sorry,
but your own actions have caused this.

75
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,520
You’ve just given me a death sentence.
I mean, who's going to cover me now?

76
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,200
You just killed me.

77
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,840
I have family, too,
so I can empathize with his argument.

78
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,800
But, basically,
the guy lied on his application.

79
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,680
-Hey. Watch it, Will.
-What?

80
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,080
Do you think he did that on purpose?

81
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,800
All right.

82
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,600
It wasn't my job
to assess what his intentions were.

83
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,080
It was my job
to check the accuracy of his claim.

84
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,160
Look, everybody thinks we're the bad guys.

85
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,680
Nobody mentions the millions of people
we help every year without incident

86
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:38,160
or the millions of dollars
we donate to charity every year

87
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,880
or all the free clinics we support.

88
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,560
<i>-Short answers, Will. Short answers.
-Today in probate court,</i>

89
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,600
<i>the assets for one of history’s
most notorious serial killers, John Kramer,</i>

90
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,920
<i>were distributed.</i>

91
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,320
<i>They were mainly in real estate holdings.
But in my time researching...</i>

92
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,680
One more question.
Who found the error on his application?

93
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:58,120
The dog pit. They work as a team.

94
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:03,360
lf there's a discrepancy to be found
in an application, the six of them will find it.

95
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,560
Sir, they're waiting for you
in the conference room.

96
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,640
Very good.

97
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,200
-How's it going today, people?
-Great, Mr. E.

98
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,600
Found two application errors
for a chronically ill client.

99
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,960
This guy practically lives
at his doctor's office.

100
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,680
I mean, this could probably save us
nearly 200K over his lifetime.

101
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,120
Terminator strikes again.

102
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,280
I'll be back in a few hours.

103
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,320
Looking good, Hank.

104
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:30,520
<i>Who will offer the most flesh
in order to save their life?</i>

105
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,240
<i>The choice is yours.</i>

106
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,560
<i>I'm not dying for you, bitch!</i>

107
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,520
Yeah.

108
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,480
I'm on my way.

109
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,160
What's going on?

110
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,440
Feds who took over the crime scene
are requesting you ASAP.

111
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,800
Erickson.

112
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,520
I didn't know you ever made it out
from behind the desk.

113
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,440
I make exceptions when fingerprints
are found at a Jigsaw murder scene.

114
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,800
Have a look.

115
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,760
We also got a right index off the scale.

116
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:39,080
-Been ID'd yet?
-Yeah. They're Agent Strahm's.

117
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,240
When I learned that he and Perez
were being targeted by Jigsaw,

118
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,960
I should have been more aware.
But I didn't see this coming.

119
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,240
Not from Patar Strahm.

120
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,720
-It was a shock to all of us.
-Yeah.

121
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:56,200
But we have something
he doesn't know about.

122
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,080
You want to follow me?

123
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,840
Lindsey.

124
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,280
-Detective Hoffman.
-Perez.

125
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,520
It was my call, Detective.

126
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,240
I knew that Jigsaw wasn't working alone,

127
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,680
but until I knew for certain
who was helping him,

128
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,880
I couldn't guarantee her well-being.

129
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:30,280
-So you let me think she was dead?
-Well, I didn't know who I could trust.

130
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,040
What else have you been keeping from me?

131
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,280
We know that Agent Strahm knew
the five people in the real estate scam,

132
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,400
the victims from the traps
that Erickson found.

133
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,480
-How'd he know them?
-Strahm and I investigated them

134
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,640
after the house fire.

135
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,160
It was arson
and all five people were accountable.

136
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,760
But after our lone witness went missing,
no charges were ever filed.

137
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,040
Strahm couldn't let them get away,
so he put them in a trap

138
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,360
in which slaughtering each other
was the only way out.

139
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,120
So, what are you telling me,
he's a vigilante?

140
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,120
Call him whatever you like,
but he has to be found.

141
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,880
We'd like to work together on this.

142
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,400
You led me to believe that she was dead,
and you want to work with me?

143
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,880
Look, we're offering full disclosure,
Detective.

144
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:15,760
From now on, everything we know,
you know. Is that fair?

145
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,640
Detective Hoffman,
how about a quick word?

146
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,560
Pamela Jankins,
the resident Jigsaw sensationalist.

147
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,040
Just reporting the facts, Detective.

148
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,320
Is that what you're doing?
“John Kramer, conundrum of carnage.”

149
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,880
lf you'd like to make a statement
on the record,

150
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,360
I'd be more than happy to take it.

151
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:42,080
You know, twisting the facts
to make a better story is irresponsible.

152
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,280
Excuse me. Nice catching up.

153
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,520
I know more about John Kramar
than you might think.

154
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,280
Somehow I doubt that.

155
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,000
Kramer left his wife a box in his will.
Did you know that?

156
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,720
Maybe I did, maybe I didn't.
How do you know it?

157
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,960
Probate court. It's public record
for those who know where to look.

158
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,520
All right. What do you really want?

159
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,480
Jill Tuck. Help me get to her
and I'll dial down on the sensationalism.

160
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,800
Really? I'll see what I can do.

161
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,880
Do you remember
how you were transported there?

162
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,080
I don't know how I got there.

163
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,960
Just opened my eyes and...
He did this to me.

164
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,040
Who did this?

165
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,040
Jigsaw.

166
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:38,160
-You didn't cut your own arm off?
-I did. I did .

167
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,760
But he made me do it.

168
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,000
And why is that?

169
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:46,440
Because what Eddie and I were doing
was wrong.

170
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,080
We were... We were ruining people's lives.

171
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,720
And he wanted us to learn.

172
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,000
And did you?

173
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,120
Look at me.

174
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,240
Look at my goddamn arm!

175
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,320
What the fuck am I supposed to learn
from this, huh?

176
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:15,480
Look at my arm! What...
What am I supposed to learn from this?

177
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,960
-Just breathe.
-Look at me!

178
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,240
<i>Hello, Gideon.</i>

179
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,680
<i>-It’s a good name, hon.
-Wow Wow.</i>

180
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:33,200
<i>Could have been Scarlet.
But, no, has to be a boy.</i>

181
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,360
<i>Let me see
if I can get all three of us in there.</i>

182
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:41,000
<i>Snuggle around here.
Lean inside. There we go.</i>

183
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,760
<i>-There we are.
-Hey, Gideon.</i>

184
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,040
<i>Here's a little happy family.</i>

185
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,360
<i>-We love you, Son. We're waiting for you.
-We love you.</i>

186
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,320
<i>Gideon, Gideon, Gideon.</i>

187
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,640
<i>lf you're watching this, Jill,
I'm long gone from this world.</i>

188
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:12,160
<i>I'm leaving you a box today,
and its contents are of grave importance.</i>

189
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,800
<i>Hello. I'm not in right now,
but please leave a message.</i>

190
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,720
<i>Miss Tuck, this Is Pamela Jenkins calling,
yet again.</i>

191
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,440
<i>I was hoping you can clear some things up
for me about your husband.</i>

192
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,960
<i>Let me buy you lunch or a cup of coffee.</i>

193
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,960
<i>I've found something interesting
about John Kramer's death.</i>

194
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,360
<i>Are you there, Detective?</i>

195
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:10,600
<i>By hearing this tape,
you will likely assume this is over.</i>

196
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,040
<i>You feel you now have control, don't you?</i>

197
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,440
<i>You think you will walk away untested.</i>

198
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,920
Look here.

199
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,920
These are the Jigsaw pieces
cut from previous victims.

200
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,120
This is the piece
taken from the latest victim.

201
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,160
-It looks like all the rest.
-Yeah, that's what we said, too.

202
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,400
The skin abrasions, they’re indicative
of a knife with a partially serrated edge.

203
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,240
-So?
-So, all of the other cuts were made

204
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,280
with a near-perfect blade
of surgical quality.

205
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,920
Obviously, Strahm used a different knife
than John Kramer.

206
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,680
Right. But it got us curious,
so we pulled the files to compare.

207
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,200
That same knife was used
on only one other victim.

208
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,960
And that victim was Seth Baxter,

209
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,600
the man who killed your sister.

210
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,800
You're telling me that you can tell
a different knife was used from a photo?

211
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,640
No, but I can.
I was the one who examined that body.

212
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,880
I’ve examined every victim
of the Jigsaw Killer.

213
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,000
Good work.

214
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:23,160
The tape from the latest victim was missing,
so we're looking into the Seth Baxter tape.

215
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:26,640
-Why's that?
-Well, if a different person cut the piece,

216
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,720
then maybe a different person
made the tape, too.

217
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,600
-Strahm?
-Yeah, maybe.

218
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,440
Strahm's voice on that tape
would be our smoking gun.

219
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,680
lf we had that,
we'd go public with his involvement.

220
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,960
Hey, Jill.

221
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,320
-But that's not what the prescription...
-I'm sick!

222
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,760
-Look at me! Look at me!
-Hey. It’s okay. Sorry.

223
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,840
I didn't expect to see you here so soon.

224
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,120
Change of plans.

225
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,920
-The game begins tonight.
-Why?

226
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,560
Because somebody knows about the box
that shouldn't.

227
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,440
-Who?
-That's not your concern.

228
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,960
All you need to know is that from now on,
I control all aspects of the game.

229
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,760
That's not what John wanted.

230
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,440
Give me the envelopes.
And that's not a request.

231
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,680
Here.

232
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,640
From now on, I work alone.

233
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,920
I know.
I'm only carrying out John's final request.

234
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,120
Well, John's dead.
And his work is almost done.

235
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,920
-Who's this?
-Unfinished business.

236
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:12,560
When I'm done, we no longer speak.

237
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,600
-...forty-five minutes.
-Yes, I understand that.

238
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,200
-Please! Please.
-But we have to wait for the doctor.

239
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,800
Let my hand go.

240
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:31,560
Methadone is a masking agent.
It doesn't heal, it simply numbs the senses.

241
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,960
I've found a better way.

242
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:42,120
These people, they will continue to hurt you
and let you down.

243
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,080
They’re addicts, John.
Recovery is a process.

244
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:48,280
Maybe addiction's just part
of human nature.

245
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:53,440
But what about these people, Jill,
who come here every day and use you?

246
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:58,040
They bide their time.
They're avoiding prison sentences.

247
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,640
They’re getting hooked on masking agents.
Do you call that recovery?

248
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,280
It’s not that simple.

249
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,400
Addiction is not simple, Jill! Wake up!

250
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,160
These people have no respect
for the lives that they're destroying.

251
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,800
Once you see death up close,

252
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,520
then you know what the value of life is.

253
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,760
And that's my way.

254
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,680
And I brought proof that it works.

255
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:43,080
-Amanda?
-Hello, Jill.

256
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,800
Jill,

257
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,760
you once told me that she was a lost soul.

258
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,760
But here she stands.

259
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,360
She’s clean and whole.

260
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:06,160
And she has a new appreciation for her life.

261
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,080
It works. It’s real. He helped me.

262
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,520
<i>...as this Is not just
the macabre conjectures of a psychic,</i>

263
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,240
<i>but a foregone conclusion
just waiting to rear its ugly head.</i>

264
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:40,680
<i>Even though police would have you believe
John Kramer, aka Jigsaw, Is dead,</i>

265
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:45,240
<i>just this past week a new so-called game
was discovered with grisly results.</i>

266
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,160
<i>Victims have included anyone associated</i>

267
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,360
<i>with the life of John Kramer,
however remote.</i>

268
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:54,440
<i>The Jigsaw Killer may be dead,
but the murders continue.</i>

269
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,720
Shit!

270
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,240
Hank, you still here?

271
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,400
Don't fucking move.

272
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,760
Shit! Oh, fuck! Okay.

273
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,920
Okay, I'm gonna take care of you. Just...
Where'd you get hit? You wearing a vest?

274
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,040
<i>Hello, William.</i>

275
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,480
Oh, Jesus.

276
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:43,440
<i>You've probably been wondering
when we would see each other again.</i>

277
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,040
<i>-Today is that day.
-No!</i>

278
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:50,840
<i>For years, your probability formula
has decided the fate of others.</i>

279
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,160
<i>The healthy have benefited</i>

280
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,960
<i>while the potentially sick
have been unjustly rejected.</i>

281
00:25:56,040 --> 00:26:00,560
<i>However, this formula does not take
into account the human will to live.</i>

282
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,040
<i>When faced with death,</i>

283
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:06,800
<i>who should live versus who will live
are two entirely separate things.</i>

284
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,960
<i>Today, your policy will be put to the test.</i>

285
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:14,880
<i>There are four straps around your limbs,
and you have four tests you must complete,</i>

286
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:20,440
<i>for if you don't, the straps On your arms
and legs will detonate.</i>

287
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,280
<i>Look closely.</i>

288
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,240
Oh, shit!

289
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:34,320
<i>You have 60 minutes to complete your tests
and avoid this fate, startling now.</i>

290
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,440
<i>You are not alone in this game.</i>

291
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,280
<i>Just as you have taken loved ones away
from their families,</i>

292
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,080
<i>if you don't reach the end
before the timer hilts zero,</i>

293
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,360
<i>you will never see your family again.</i>

294
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:53,360
Mom? Mom! Mom. Mom, wake up! Mom.

295
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,320
Mom.

296
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,520
-Where are we?
-I don't know.

297
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,560
-What is this?
-I don't know! Look.

298
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,160
Oh, my God.

299
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,920
<i>Here is your first test.</i>

300
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,200
<i>Your health and hereditary background
put you in the highest category of success.</i>

301
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,680
<i>However, the same cannot be said
for your adversary.</i>

302
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,920
<i>While only 52 years of age,
this man has continued to smoke</i>

303
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,280
<i>even though he has a history
of high blood pressure and heart disease.</i>

304
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:39,120
<i>This demonstrates very little appreciation
for the blessings of his own life.</i>

305
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,880
<i>Your game will focus
on the simple element of air.</i>

306
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:47,680
<i>Once this game begins,
every time you take a breath,</i>

307
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:52,000
<i>the clamps around your chest will close in
and crush your body.</i>

308
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,880
<i>The only escape is in the other's failure.</i>

309
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:59,640
<i>So I ask you, when faced with death,
who will survive?</i>

310
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,520
<i>Live or die, William. Make your choice.</i>

311
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,240
-Fuck you!
-Who the hell is that?

312
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,560
Hold your breath!

313
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:04,280
What the fuck? Oh, Jesus!

314
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,200
Come on! Come on!

315
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,920
Shit!

316
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,960
Please help us!

317
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:01,400
Help us! Someone, please! Please! Help us!

318
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:07,440
Somebody, please! Please!
Please, somebody help!

319
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,800
Anybody?

320
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,720
“Live. Die.” What the fuck?

321
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,640
It's connected to that.

322
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,760
-”H-F.” What does that stand for?
-Hydrofluoric acid.

323
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,720
This stuff will eat through human flesh
within seconds.

324
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:37,880
-What should we do?
-Pull the lever. You want to live, don't you?

325
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:41,000
What about the timer?
That has to mean something.

326
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,720
I don't know.
I don't even know why we're here.

327
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,760
We're here because of your father.

328
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,160
Miss Jenkins.

329
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:38,000
Please, this will only take a second.
We can help each other.

330
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,240
What makes you think
you can just come to my door like this?

331
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,320
Because I found something
you'll want to see.

332
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,240
Go on.

333
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,960
-Where'd you get this?
-It was at the location where John died.

334
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,400
-Does it mean anything to you?
-No.

335
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,320
Goodbye, Miss Jankins.

336
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,880
lf you think of anything.

337
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,720
<i>I want to thank you
for sponsoring this party, William.</i>

338
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,800
<i>And I know
how much the clinic appreciates lt.</i>

339
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,520
-John Kramer.
-William Easton.

340
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:13,040
-Kramer? You're Jill's husband, right?
-I am.

341
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,720
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

342
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
<i>Sounds like we're
in a similar business, John.</i>

343
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,080
<i>Oh. yeah? How's that?</i>

344
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:22,320
Well, you try to predict people's behavior.
So do I.

345
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,560
When people come to us for coverage,

346
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:29,320
we have to analyze each parson
for the probability of success.

347
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,720
-How do you do that?
-Well, it's a formula.

348
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,080
It's pretty complicated, actually,

349
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:36,520
but, in essence,
it breaks down to monthly payments

350
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,720
multiplied by lifespan
minus the probability of illness.

351
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,840
And if the sum is positive,
we consider coverage.

352
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:48,040
-Who devised that formula?
-Me.

353
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:52,920
So, in a sense,
you choose who lives or dies.

354
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:58,280
No. I... No, I'd say I decide which people
have the potential

355
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,400
to live long, healthy lives.

356
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:05,000
But you're not taking into consideration
the most important human element of all.

357
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,880
-Which is what?
-The will to live.

358
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,480
Until a person is faced with death,

359
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:16,320
it's impossible to tall
whether they have what it takes to survive.

360
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,840
Fuck that.

361
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,080
Shit.

362
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,000
<i>Hello, William.</i>

363
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:41,360
<i>Standing on the platforms behind me
are two of your colleagues.</i>

364
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:46,080
<i>One, your file clerk, a young, healthy male
with no living relatives.</i>

365
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:52,360
<i>The other, a middle-aged woman
with a family history of diabetes.</i>

366
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,640
<i>According to your policy,
your secretary is older and weaker</i>

367
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,680
<i>and therefore less worthy to survive.</i>

368
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:04,320
<i>But you know the loss
that she will be to her family,</i>

369
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:09,000
<i>while young Allen will disappear
without a blip on the world’s radar.</i>

370
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:15,440
<i>Only one can exit this room,
and the choice of whom falls upon you.</i>

371
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,320
<i>You must let go of one
to save the life of the other.</i>

372
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,840
<i>As you can see, the choice is not so clear</i>

373
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:27,360
<i>when you are face to face with the people
whose blood will stain your hands.</i>

374
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,120
<i>Let the game begin.</i>

375
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:37,520
Wait! No! No, wait!
I won't do this! I won't do this!

376
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,440
William!

377
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:51,920
It’s a business!
My decisions aren't made this way!

378
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,640
No, I'm not gonna do it! I'm not gonna do it!

379
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,560
I'm not gonna do it!

380
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:06,320
-Stop!
-Please! Help me!

381
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,760
-I'm sorry.
-No! No!

382
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,880
I'm sorry.

383
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:18,200
Thank you. Thank you!

384
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:28,280
You try to find a way out of here, Addy.
I have to keep going. Be careful.

385
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,240
What if we put acid on the metal bars?
It'll eat through the metal, won't it?

386
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:03,760
Yeah, but how are we going to get it
on the bars? With our hands?

387
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,400
What are you looking at?

388
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,200
I wonder... The mirror.

389
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:17,400
-What?
-Who's behind the glass?

390
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,880
What do you want?

391
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,160
Why are you doing this?

392
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:31,840
<i>Help me, please! Please, help me!</i>

393
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:50,480
<i>Hello, Pamela
You've sensationalized my life,</i>

394
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:54,680
<i>twisting the truth and exploiting
my message for your own benefit.</i>

395
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,640
<i>-Hoffman.
-It's Erickson.</i>

396
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,400
<i>-We found the Seth Baxter tape.
-Yeah?</i>

397
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,320
But there was something else
that we wanted to discuss with you.

398
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,720
<i>-What's that?
-Better to talk about it in person.</i>

399
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,480
It’s time-sensitive.

400
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,920
I'll be right there.

401
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,040
Excuse me.

402
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,760
-Just down there.
-Thank you.

403
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:20,760
<i>The device Timothy is strapped to
is my personal favorite. I call it The Rack.</i>

404
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:34,120
Last-minute tweaks?
Told you he'd fuck with it.

405
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,960
lf you switch the gear ratio,

406
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:40,000
you have to change the gear grease
to match the increased friction.

407
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,960
Maybe you should stick to the heavy lifting.

408
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,080
You need five-weight.

409
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,160
It’s in the gun.

410
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,640
Check with me next time.

411
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,720
How many next times are there gonna be?

412
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,280
However many there needs to be.

413
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:08,200
That's a human being.

414
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,360
Do you like how brutality feels, Mark?

415
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:18,360
Let's be honest. You want him to suffer
just as much as I do.

416
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:44,760
-So when's your test, Detective?
-I don't need one.

417
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,120
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

418
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:51,400
Because I didn't take my life for granted.

419
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:55,160
You’re still dragging your knuckles
on the ground.

420
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:57,120
What do you know about life?

421
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:06,920
Get used to me,
'cause I'm not going anywhere.

422
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,160
You sure about that?

423
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,000
Time is short.

424
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:22,840
You okay?

425
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:29,080
Now it's time to go get Dr. Denlon
from the hospital.

426
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:32,440
Okay. I'll take you back.

427
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,600
Go. Be quick.

428
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:14,480
-Why'd you coma?
-John, please stop.

429
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,960
-Don't do this.
-I promise you,

430
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,400
when all this is done,

431
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,800
I will provide a way out for you.

432
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:32,200
I wish that time was now.

433
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,680
Then I have something for you.

434
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,440
What's this for?

435
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:58,280
When the time’s right,
you'll know what to do with it.

436
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:27,880
Shit!

437
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:41,800
<i>I came to talk to you, Will, because</i>

438
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:47,560
I’ve found a treatment for my cancer
that I think holds a lot of promise.

439
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:49,680
But my requests for coverage

440
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:53,880
-have all been turned down.
-Yeah.

441
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:56,560
So I was hoping that if I came
and explained it to you,

442
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:59,880
that you might be able
to get that overturned for me.

443
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:05,800
-Well, the buck stops here, John. Fire away.
-Okay.

444
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,720
This is a doctor in Norway.

445
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:15,200
He's got a 30 to 40% success rate
with gene therapy.

446
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:20,440
He injects what he calls suicide genes
into cancerous tumor cells.

447
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:23,720
<i>Then an inactive form of a toxic drug
is administered. ..</i>

448
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:26,920
Yes. I'm familiar with the therapy
you're talking about.

449
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,920
Right. And a new trial's starting.

450
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,480
He's looking for new patients,

451
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,600
and he seems to think
that I'm the perfect candidate.

452
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:37,520
John, if your primary physician, Dr. Gordon,
thought you were a suitable candidate,

453
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:39,920
-he would have pursued it.
-No.

454
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,280
Dr. Gordon is a specialist. You know,
he's making money on his specialty.

455
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,920
He's not a thinker.

456
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,920
I mean, the man has his hand
on the doorknob half the time that I'm there.

457
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,480
I'm gonna be straight with you. At your age
and with the development of your cancer,

458
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:53,240
it's simply not feasible
for Umbrella Health.

459
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:56,120
Wait, wait, wait, wait. What's not feasible?

460
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:59,920
By whose mathematical equation
is this not feasible?

461
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,840
It's policy, John. It’s policy.

462
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:06,440
And if you go outside the system
and seek out this treatment,

463
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:10,320
which has been deemed ineffective,
you will be in breach of policy

464
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:13,040
and you will be dropped
from coverage completely.

465
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,080
I'm sorry.

466
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,720
Did you know that in the Far East,

467
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:30,440
people pay their doctors
when they're healthy?

468
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:34,280
When they’re sick,
they don't have to pay them.

469
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:38,720
So, basically,
they end up paying for what they want,

470
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,720
not what they don't want.

471
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:44,520
We got it all ass-backwards here.

472
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:50,680
These politicians, they say the same thing
over and over and over again.

473
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:54,560
“Healthcare decisions should be made
by doctors and their patients,

474
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:55,800
“not by the government.”

475
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:59,280
Well, now I know they’re not made
by doctors and their patients

476
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:01,080
or by the government.

477
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,360
They’re made
by the fucking insurance companies.

478
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:07,960
Piranha.

479
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:15,080
John, please.
lf you do this, you'll be on your own,

480
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:17,360
and the subsequent cost to you
will be staggering.

481
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:20,720
Don't talk to me about money.
I have money.

482
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:24,120
This is about principle.

483
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,280
You see, Will,
this is my life we're talking about.

484
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:34,440
-You remember?
-What about Jill's life?

485
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:35,960
How's she going to be taken care of
when you're gone?

486
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:37,960
Let me worry about Jill.

487
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:42,160
The type of cancer you have
is malignant and inoperable.

488
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,040
That rolled off your tongue real smooth.

489
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:46,960
Even if the treatment works,
the cancer will return eventually.

490
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:50,360
-It's an unwinnable battle.
-That was even smoother.

491
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:53,320
As a matter of fact,
that was downright slick.

492
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:58,920
You think it's the living
who will have ultimate judgment over you,

493
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,400
because the dead will have no claim
over your soul,

494
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,280
but you may be mistaken.

495
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:30,640
Oh, shit!

496
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:42,600
<i>Hello, William.
You have seen the flaws in your policy.</i>

497
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:46,240
<i>But what you have not seen
is the extent some people will go to</i>

498
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:48,120
<i>when faced with death.</i>

499
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:53,040
<i>The lawyer from your firm has...</i>

500
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:55,440
<i>-Debbie!
-...90 seconds to cross this room</i>

501
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:59,600
<i>or the device attached to her chest
will discharge and pierce her brain.</i>

502
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:02,280
It’s gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay.

503
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:06,440
<i>She will find that the journey
across this room is filled with danger.</i>

504
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:11,680
<i>In order for her to make it,
you will need to be there for her,</i>

505
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:16,160
<i>and it is you who ultimately holds the key
to her survival.</i>

506
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:21,160
<i>When faced with death,
will she have the skills to live?</i>

507
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:23,560
<i>Let the game begin.</i>

508
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:27,960
Okay. Okay, listen!

509
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:30,640
-Jesus Christ! What the fuck is this?
-Debbie! Debbie! Listen to me!

510
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:33,600
-Debbie! Okay, Debbie, listen to me! Debbie!
-What is this?

511
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:36,120
-Get me the fuck out of here!
-Get through the maze

512
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:37,640
as fast as you can. Listen to me!

513
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:39,600
-Get me out of here!
-Debbie!

514
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:45,040
Okay. You've got to get through this maze
as fast as you can! Go! Move now! Go now!

515
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:51,760
Come on! You can make it! You can make it!
You got to keep moving! Go!

516
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:55,640
-Will, this is insane! I can't!
-Go! You can make it!

517
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:58,760
Come on! You can make it!
You've got to keep moving!

518
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:06,400
Wait a minute!
I think I can help you up here!

519
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:08,360
Maybe this will stop it!

520
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,440
Yes! Yes!

521
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:16,120
Do it again! it worked! it worked!

522
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:19,200
-Do it again! it worked, it worked, it worked!
-Okay! Ready?

523
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:21,280
-Yes!
-Go!

524
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:41,000
Keep moving! Don't stop!
Keep going! Keep going! Keep going!

525
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:43,360
Don't stop!

526
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:48,680
You gotta keep going! Keep going! Go! Go!

527
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:52,520
Keep moving! Go! Go! Go!

528
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:58,120
Fuck, I can't! It’s a fucking trap!
There's no way out!

529
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,120
It’s a fucking trap! I can't!

530
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:09,960
No! No, there’s a ladder at the end!
So just go under! I'll help you!

531
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:13,280
Ready?

532
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:16,640
Go!

533
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:40,560
God! Come on, Debbie, go! Climb! Climb!

534
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:45,160
Come on! Come on, you're almost there!
You're almost there!

535
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,360
Go! Go! Go!

536
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:53,720
Okay, look for a key.
There's got to be a key! Look for a key!

537
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:57,440
What?

538
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,080
What are you waiting for?

539
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:03,280
-It’s in you.
-What?

540
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:06,360
-It’s fucking inside you!
-Oh, fuck!

541
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:13,320
Okay. Okay, I can do this. Wait!

542
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,320
-What the fuck are you doing?
-I need that fucking key!

543
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:38,600
I can get it! I can get it! I can get it!

544
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:45,160
God! No! God! No!

545
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:11,760
<i>Hello, Pamela.</i>

546
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:17,680
<i>Well, today you will experience
the meaning of sacrifice.</i>

547
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:22,200
<i>And you will see the consequence
for those who unjustly hurt others.</i>

548
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:23,440
Fuck!

549
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:46,200
Someone's there. They’re watching us.

550
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:50,280
Why? Why would someone do this?

551
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:52,160
To see how we respond.

552
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:55,840
They want to know
what decision we'll make.

553
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:00,960
-Let’s pull it.
-No! We don't know what it does yet.

554
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:02,520
It’s too risky.

555
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:07,080
Fuck!

556
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:14,200
Hey.

557
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:17,040
-Thanks for coming in.
-What'd you find?

558
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:19,240
-An abnormality in Strahm's fingerprint.
-What?

559
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:20,640
Take a look.

560
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,080
So the human fingerprint leaves
an oily residue,

561
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:27,360
and depending on how long
it's been exposed to the elements,

562
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:30,240
-it's highly susceptible to contamination.
-So what's the problem?

563
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:33,520
Well, we found trace amounts
of halomethane R-12.

564
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,480
She means Fraon.

565
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:37,840
Production of R-12 ceased in 1994.

566
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:41,440
So the question is, was the contaminant
we found at the site already

567
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:43,280
or did Strahm bring it in with him?

568
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:45,080
Yeah. We’re looking
into the building's function

569
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:47,040
before it was abandoned.

570
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:49,600
Excuse me.

571
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:53,440
Did anything coma
from the Seth Baxter tape?

572
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:56,480
<i>Yeah, actually,
we might be on to something.</i>

573
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:58,200
The tape was in pretty rough shape
when we found it,

574
00:56:58,280 --> 00:56:59,840
but we were able to authenticate it.

575
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:04,200
The voice was intentionally distorted,
but it didn't match John Kramer's.

576
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:07,280
-It’s currently being analyzed.
-For what?

577
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:11,240
Well, we’re trying to descramble the tape
to find the original voice.

578
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:13,560
He's on with the tech right now.

579
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:18,440
Are you timing something? Your watch.

580
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:22,360
I was before I got your call, yeah.

581
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:26,760
We got it. This is our smoking gun.

582
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:30,600
The lab's off-site. Coma on.

583
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:35,080
-You're coming, right?
-Of course.

584
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,040
You shut up! All you do
is try to take over every situation.

585
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:13,400
You don't know what the fuck
you're talking about!

586
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:14,920
Shut the fuck up!

587
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:18,200
-Fuck off!
-Would you two just shut up already!

588
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:19,520
We can figure this out.

589
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:22,960
-Hey! Who's in there?
-Mr. Easton? is that you?

590
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:26,040
-Yeah. Shelby? Who's in there with you?
-Mr. Easton!

591
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:28,680
We’re all in here, sir. All six of us.
What the hell is going on?

592
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:30,200
Everybody! We need your help.

593
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:31,800
What can you see?

594
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:34,440
We can't see anything. It’s pitch dark.

595
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:38,200
-What's that sound?
-I don't know, something we're chained to.

596
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:41,080
-It’s spinning. Oh, God.
-Get us out of here!

597
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:43,560
-You have to help us!
-Please!

598
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:46,560
Come on, get us out of here, Mr. E!

599
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,120
Mr. Easton!

600
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:58,360
Mr. Easton! You got to get us out of here!

601
00:58:58,440 --> 00:58:59,720
Oh, my God!

602
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:03,040
Pull it together, Mr. Easton. Come on!

603
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:04,720
-You can do it!
-You can do it!

604
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:06,720
Mr. Easton! Mr. Easton!

605
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:09,400
Please! Please get us out of here! Please!

606
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:11,400
Mr. Easton, what is this?

607
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,120
It's a game.

608
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:17,320
-Game?
-Mr. Easton?

609
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:32,080
<i>Hello, William Before you are six
of your most valuable associates,</i>

610
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:34,960
<i>the ones who find errors in policies.</i>

611
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:37,600
<i>Their findings result in over two-thirds</i>

612
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:41,560
<i>of all applications denied
or prematurely terminated.</i>

613
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:46,920
<i>Now you must apply your analysis to them.
And will you be able to find their errors?</i>

614
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:50,000
<i>Six ride the carousel.</i>

615
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:55,400
<i>But only two can get off.</i>

616
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:59,840
<i>The decision of which two survive
falls upon you.</i>

617
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:03,680
<i>But remember,
the mounted gun will continue to fire</i>

618
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:05,960
<i>until all six rounds are spent.</i>

619
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:10,720
<i>And if no decision is made on your part,
all six will perish.</i>

620
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:12,440
What? What?

621
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:14,440
<i>To offer the two reprieves,</i>

622
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:18,840
<i>you must press both buttons at once
in the box before you.</i>

623
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:23,120
<i>However, in doing so
you'll give a sacrifice of your own.</i>

624
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,920
<i>Two can live, four will die.</i>

625
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:30,120
<i>Your decision's symbolized
by the blood on your hands.</i>

626
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:38,480
Mr. Easton, wake up!
You gotta get us out of here!

627
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:40,680
-Pick me!
-Mr. Easton, come on!

628
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:44,240
Listen to me.
Mr. Easton, I am the one who should live.

629
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:46,440
-Do something!
-Fuck.

630
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:51,320
Jesus Christ!

631
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:55,960
Please, Mr. Easton! Mr. Easton! Please!

632
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:58,960
Follow the policy, Mr. Easton. Do it!

633
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:03,440
Please! Mr. Easton, follow the policy!
Follow the policy!

634
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:09,280
-Holy shit!
-Oh, my God!

635
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:12,560
-No!
-Oh, my God!

636
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:14,080
What the fuck!

637
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:16,320
-What the fuck!
-No!

638
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:21,840
Mr. E! They say we're only as strong
as the weakest link!

639
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:24,080
I'm the strongest! You can't let me die!

640
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:27,320
Fuck him!
I'm healthy, sir. I'm healthy! Please!

641
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:29,240
Mr. Easton, come on!

642
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:32,800
No, I have two kids.
You know them well. Please!

643
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:36,360
Please, they can't grow up without ma!
They need me!

644
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:43,720
Oh, shit!

645
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:58,760
Thank you! Thank you!

646
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:01,240
-Fucking hell!
-Thank you.

647
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:04,200
Fuck her!
You don't even know her, Mr. Easton.

648
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:07,760
Listen to me, okay?
My parents are sick, okay?

649
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:09,960
-They need me. I'm all they have, please!
-You fucking liar!

650
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:12,280
-Your parents hate you! They cut you off!
-What?

651
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:15,400
-Shut up! That's not true!
-Fuck you, it is true. I sit next to you!

652
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:19,160
-I... I'm pregnant. I'm pregnant!
-No, she's not! She's lying!

653
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:20,800
-She's fucking lying!
-Fuck you!

654
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:22,680
-Mr. Easton, she is lying!
-I'm pregnant!

655
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:25,240
-She's lying.
-No! No, fuck!

656
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:26,760
-I'm pregnant!
-She's fucking lying!

657
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:30,280
He's lying, Mr. Easton, it's not true!
Please! Please!

658
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:33,400
Fuck! Push the thing! Push the thing!

659
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:35,520
-She's lying.
-No!

660
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:38,760
-Mr. Easton, push it! Push the thing!
-Oh, God! No!

661
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:42,280
Push it!

662
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:46,080
Oh, God! What the...

663
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:49,360
What the fuck!

664
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:52,920
You have to trust me! I won't lie to you!

665
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:56,320
-Oh, please! He's a kiss-ass!
-Mr. Easton! My parents are loaded!

666
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:57,960
-Oh, God!
-They'll give you whatever you want!

667
01:02:58,040 --> 01:02:59,200
-Just say a number!
-He's a thief!

668
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:01,160
He's been stealing from the company
for years!

669
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:04,720
It's true! It’s true! It’s true! It’s true!

670
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:06,440
-Thief!
-Fuck you!

671
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:08,760
-It’s true! He has been...
-Don't listen to them!

672
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:11,560
-Don't listen to them, Mr. E!
-It’s true!

673
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:16,000
Christ! Mr. Easton, come on! Mr. Easton...

674
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:28,280
Okay, Mr. Easton, listen to me carefully.
I'm on your side, and I can help you.

675
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:33,560
-But you cannot trust this bitch!
-What? Fuck you!

676
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:35,440
-She's a fucking liar!
-What?

677
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:39,000
You cannot believe her.
She has already tried to lie!

678
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:42,880
And she's just going to continue to do it!
You know it!

679
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:44,320
It’s me, Josh!

680
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:48,560
No, I haven't! What about you?
He wants to be you! Okay, you know that!

681
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:51,960
But he'll slit your throat
at the first opportunity!

682
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:58,040
Please don't let me die! Please! No, please!

683
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:07,000
-Oh, my God!
-Oh, fuck!

684
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:15,080
Oh, God!

685
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:19,840
Thank you!

686
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:26,200
Oh, well, that's it, isn't it? It’s over!

687
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:29,560
-You mother fucker!
-Stop it!

688
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:34,120
You spineless,
pussy-whipped motherfucker!

689
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:39,080
That's all it takes, eh?
A bitch says one thing and it's all over!

690
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:44,520
You know what, William?
Your policy, it's bullshit!

691
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:46,800
Fucking bullshit!

692
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:50,280
Well, you listen to me, you son of a bitch!

693
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:52,720
I did everything for you.

694
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:01,640
Look at me!
When you're killing me, you look at me!

695
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:14,920
Thank you.

696
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:18,560
Oh, my God!

697
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:22,200
-Thank you.
-Emily.

698
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:46,720
<i>Right now, you're feeling helpless.</i>

699
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:50,440
<i>Right now, you're feeling helpless.</i>

700
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:53,840
<i>Right now, you're feeling helpless.</i>

701
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:58,000
<i>Right now, you're feeling helpless.</i>

702
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:02,360
-How's it going?
-Good.

703
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:05,480
This is it.

704
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:07,640
Whoever made this tape had access

705
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:10,280
to some very impressive
audio-filtration equipment.

706
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:12,960
<i>Right now, you're feeling helpless.</i>

707
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:15,840
Fortunately, we have some tricks
of our own here.

708
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:20,600
We can turn his algorithm upside down
and let us hear what he really sounds like.

709
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,840
Let's hear what you got.

710
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,040
<i>Right now, you're feeling helpless.</i>

711
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:32,400
You okay?

712
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:36,200
You seem a little preoccupied.

713
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:38,520
I'm just anxious about the tape.

714
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:43,280
<i>Right now, you're feeling helpless.</i>

715
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:47,400
<i>-Right now, you're feeling helpless.
-You know, there are still a couple of things</i>

716
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:51,000
<i>-I can't quite wrap my head around.
-Right now, you're feeling helpless.</i>

717
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:53,960
Like, I don't understand
Strahm's motivation.

718
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:56,520
He was my partner for five years.

719
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:58,720
I mean,
we all knew he was a bit of a hothead.

720
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:02,120
But I never saw any indication
of psychotic behavior.

721
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:06,000
You never can really tell
what someone's thinking on the inside.

722
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:10,400
<i>...helpless.</i>

723
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:13,880
<i>-Hear that?
-Right now, you're feeling helpless.</i>

724
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:15,200
We're getting there.

725
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:17,720
Come on,
I thought you had something to show us.

726
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:20,720
Yeah, it's just I never really thought of him
as being vengeful.

727
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:25,440
<i>-Right now, you're feeling helpless.
-You know? I mean, all the facts are there.</i>

728
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:32,560
-But something doesn't sit right.
-Listen. It’s getting closer.

729
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:35,880
<i>-Right now, you're feeling...
-You know, there is an alternative.</i>

730
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:38,840
Let's say that Strahm killed Seth Baxter

731
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:42,720
specifically to set you up as an accomplice
to Jigsaw.

732
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:43,880
Okay.

733
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:47,360
Well, there's a problem with that, though.

734
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:49,360
On further analysis of Strahm's fingerprints,

735
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:52,760
it was found that the uric acid levels
in the eccrine gland residue

736
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:58,160
were inconsistent for an individual
with an active epidermal metabolism.

737
01:07:58,240 --> 01:07:59,720
In other words?

738
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:02,800
In other words, when he left his fingerprints
on the latest victim,

739
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:04,160
Strahm was already dead.

740
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:06,800
<i>-Right now, you're feeling helpless.
-There it is.</i>

741
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:09,280
<i>Right now, you're feeling helpless.</i>

742
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:34,400
Who else knows about me?

743
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:38,160
Who else fucking knows about me?

744
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:44,600
-Everyone.
-You lie. You're fucking lying.

745
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:26,400
I found something you'll want to see.

746
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:28,320
It was at the location where John died.

747
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:29,480
Does it mean anything to you?

748
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:35,560
What are you doing?

749
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:38,000
Get as far away from the sprinkler head
as possible.

750
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:39,240
We don't know what it does!

751
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:40,960
I'm not gonna just sit here and do nothing.

752
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:44,080
We need to make a decision!
Don't you understand?

753
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:09,360
Okay. You can pull it. I love you.

754
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:13,080
I love you, too. Get back.

755
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:19,080
No. You don't know what it does!

756
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:32,480
-On three, I'll pull it.
-Okay.

757
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:34,760
No. No.

758
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:38,280
One,

759
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:40,800
two,

760
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:43,720
three!

761
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:47,040
What the fuck?

762
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:53,840
It doesn't even work!
It doesn't even fucking work!

763
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:55,360
What the fuck?

764
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:01,840
It doesn't make any fucking sense.

765
01:13:12,160 --> 01:13:14,200
I think I know what it does.

766
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:31,760
Get used to me,
'cause I'm not going anywhere.

767
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:33,520
You sure about that?

768
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:40,080
Amanda will fail you.

769
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:43,000
We'll see.

770
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:57,320
<i>'"Amanda, you were with Cecil
the night Jill lost Gideon."</i>

771
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:00,640
Go.

772
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:05,640
-What the fuck are you doing? Go. Go.
-I don't know about this.

773
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:07,440
-What do you mean, you don't know?
-She's been good to us.

774
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:08,520
I've been good to you.

775
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:11,440
-I know...
-Please, please, go.

776
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:13,000
You drive me crazy.

777
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:16,240
Go on, you fucking pussy! Go! Go! Go!

778
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:20,440
-Cecil! No!
-Listen to me!

779
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:32,160
<i>“You killed their child.</i>

780
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:37,760
<i>“You know It and I know It,
so do exactly as I say.</i>

781
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:42,440
<i>“Kill Lynn Denlon
or I will tell John what you did.'"</i>

782
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:45,560
She doesn't deserve to go free!

783
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:48,600
Amanda, Lynn is more important
then you know.

784
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:54,000
Lynn!

785
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:33,320
I made it. I made it. I made it!

786
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:37,160
<i>lf you fall,
you will never see your family again.</i>

787
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:45,840
-What are you doing here?
-Will!

788
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:49,280
-Pamela!
-Yeah.

789
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:52,640
I know it's your birthday.
I'm going to make it up to you, I promise.

790
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:56,680
Are you really standing up your sister
for work? I'm your only family.

791
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:58,800
-Are you all right?
-Yeah

792
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:02,600
Let her go! I mean it! I won!

793
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:06,720
I followed your fucking rules!
Now you let her go!

794
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:08,840
You son of a bitch!

795
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:12,240
<i>You've just given me a death sentence.
I mean, who's going to cover me now?</i>

796
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:14,560
You just killed me.

797
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:16,440
Come on, let’s go.

798
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:24,480
You're the man that killed my dad.

799
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:50,000
<i>Hello, Tara. My apologies for exposing you
and your son to this kind of treatment.</i>

800
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:53,600
<i>But I can assure you,
it is not without reason.</i>

801
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:58,600
<i>The man before you just made the sacrifices
to save the life of a loved one.</i>

802
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:02,640
<i>However, when given the opportunity
to save your husband's life,</i>

803
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:04,840
<i>he chose not to.</i>

804
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:08,840
<i>Now you will be given the power
to save a life.</i>

805
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:12,600
<i>Will you grant this man the opportunity
to continue living?</i>

806
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:15,080
<i>Or will you dispense
the same death sentence</i>

807
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:16,880
<i>he issued your husband?</i>

808
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:18,280
<i>Live or die.</i>

809
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:21,280
<i>The choice Is yours.</i>

810
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:28,520
It's not my game.

811
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:40,520
<i>I'm leaving you a box today,
and its contents are of greave importance.</i>

812
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:45,400
Miss Tuck, what's in the box?

813
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:11,400
Please. Please forgive me.

814
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:13,960
Have mercy, please!

815
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:17,480
Did he show mercy
when my husband was suffering?

816
01:18:23,480 --> 01:18:25,600
John left you five envelopes.

817
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:28,480
The sixth one was for me.

818
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:35,200
This is John's will.

819
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:40,600
<i>...to watch this horror!</i>

820
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:43,880
-He had no choice!
-He always had a choice!

821
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:49,720
The reason I am doing this
isn't because I can't forgive you

822
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:51,720
for what you did to me.

823
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:55,480
The reason I'm doing this

824
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:59,560
is because I couldn't forgive myself
for what you might do to someone else.

825
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:01,880
Please, no. Please.

826
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:05,560
-You will never kill again.
-Please.

827
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:09,160
Please.

828
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:13,120
Please.

829
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,160
Please.

830
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:18,480
Please. Please.

831
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:21,520
I can't. I can't kill him.

832
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:27,880
But I can.

833
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:31,880
-No, Brant!
-You killed my father, you motherfucker!

834
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:38,240
Now you burn in hell.

835
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:06,840
Game over.

836
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:15,960
-John Kramer.
-William Easton.

837
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:17,000
Nice to meet you.

838
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:28,640
-Those are the rules, Harold.
-You've just given me a death sentence.

839
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:31,880
So, in a sense,
you choose who lives or dies.

840
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:39,480
No!

841
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:42,360
It’s policy, John. It’s policy.

842
01:20:48,120 --> 01:20:52,560
You think it's the living
who will have ultimate judgment over you,

843
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:55,760
<i>because the dead will have no claim
over your soul,</i>

844
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:01,400
but you may be mistaken.

845
01:21:11,320 --> 01:21:12,840
So when's your test, Detective?

846
01:21:15,680 --> 01:21:17,720
-I don't need one.
-Oh, yeah?

847
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:27,600
<i>You know why you're here, don't you?</i>

848
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:35,040
I want to know
if you have what it takes to survive.

849
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:38,400
<i>You feel you now have control, don't you?</i>

850
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:41,400
<i>You think you will walk away untested.</i>

851
01:21:55,680 --> 01:21:58,200
Do you like how brutality feels, Mark?

852
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:02,120
I'm only carrying out John's final request.

853
01:22:02,680 --> 01:22:04,920
You want a chance? I'll give you a chance.

854
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:30,000
Remember...

855
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:32,320
Remember...

856
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:40,680
Remember, don't trust
the one who saves you.

857
01:27:43,080 --> 01:27:45,440
Don't trust the one who saves you.
