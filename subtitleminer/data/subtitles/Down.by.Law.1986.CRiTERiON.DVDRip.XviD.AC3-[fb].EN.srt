00:00:23,701 --> 00:00:26,465
Edna Million in a drop-dead suit

2
00:00:26,537 --> 00:00:29,028
Dutch pink
on a downtown train

3
00:00:29,106 --> 00:00:32,270
Two-dollar pistol
but the gun won't shoot

4
00:00:32,344 --> 00:00:34,904
I'm in the corner
on the pouring rain

5
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:38,006
Sixteen men
on a deadman's chest

6
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:40,677
And I've been drinking
from a broken cup

7
00:00:40,752 --> 00:00:43,880
Two pairs of pants
and a mohair vest

8
00:00:43,956 --> 00:00:46,517
I'm full ofbourbon
I can't stand up

9
00:00:46,593 --> 00:00:49,494
Hey, little bird
Fly away home

10
00:00:49,562 --> 00:00:52,690
Your house is on fire
Your children are alone

11
00:00:52,765 --> 00:00:55,165
Hey, little bird
Fly away home

12
00:00:55,235 --> 00:00:58,034
Your house is on fire
Your children are alone

13
00:00:58,105 --> 00:01:01,233
Schiffer broke a bottle
on Morgan's head

14
00:01:01,308 --> 00:01:03,776
And I've been stepping
on the devil's tail

15
00:01:03,845 --> 00:01:07,075
Across the stripes
of a full moon's head

16
00:01:07,148 --> 00:01:09,582
And through the bars
of a Cuban jail

17
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:12,814
Bloody fingers
on a purple knife

18
00:01:12,887 --> 00:01:15,686
A flamingo drinking
from a cocktail glass

19
00:01:15,757 --> 00:01:18,522
I'm on the lawn
with someone else's wife

20
00:01:18,594 --> 00:01:21,062
Admire the view
from up on top of the mast

21
00:01:21,129 --> 00:01:23,997
Hey, little bird
Fly away home

22
00:01:24,066 --> 00:01:26,830
Your house is on fire
Your children are alone

23
00:01:41,285 --> 00:01:44,083
Julie, what are you doing here?

24
00:01:44,154 --> 00:01:46,281
Just watching
the light changing.

25
00:02:05,944 --> 00:02:08,208
Hey, little bird
Fly away home

26
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,114
Your house is on fire
Your children are alone

27
00:02:11,184 --> 00:02:14,085
Hey, little bird
Fly away home

28
00:02:14,154 --> 00:02:16,748
House is on fire
and your children are alone

29
00:02:16,823 --> 00:02:18,814
Hey

30
00:02:40,315 --> 00:02:43,113
Hey, little bird
Fly away home

31
00:02:43,185 --> 00:02:45,915
Your house is on fire
Your children are alone

32
00:02:45,987 --> 00:02:48,751
Hey, little bird
Fly away home

33
00:02:48,824 --> 00:02:51,794
Your house is on fire
and your children are alone

34
00:03:02,206 --> 00:03:04,197
You sleepin', baby?

35
00:03:27,198 --> 00:03:30,134
Hey, little bird
Fly away home

36
00:03:30,202 --> 00:03:33,171
Your house is on fire
Your children are alone

37
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:35,731
Hey, little bird
Fly away home

38
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:38,971
Your house is on fire
Your children are alone

39
00:03:39,044 --> 00:03:41,775
Yellow sheets
on a Hong Kong bed

40
00:03:41,848 --> 00:03:44,373
Stazybo horn
and a Slingerland ride

41
00:03:44,451 --> 00:03:47,511
To the carnival
is what she said

42
00:03:47,587 --> 00:03:50,113
A hundred dollars
makes it dark inside

43
00:03:50,191 --> 00:03:53,319
Edna Million
in a drop-dead suit

44
00:03:53,394 --> 00:03:55,919
Dutch pink
on a downtown train

45
00:03:55,997 --> 00:03:59,057
Two-dollar pistol
but the gun won't shoot

46
00:03:59,133 --> 00:04:01,658
I'm in the corner
on the pouring rain

47
00:04:01,737 --> 00:04:04,466
Hey, little bird
Fly away home

48
00:04:04,539 --> 00:04:07,703
Your house is on fire
Your children are alone

49
00:04:07,776 --> 00:04:10,301
Hey, little bird
Fly away home

50
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:13,542
Your house is on fire
Your children are alone

51
00:05:55,426 --> 00:05:58,953
- Only 'cause you don't...

52
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:01,396
'cause you don't
take care of me.

53
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,392
Or want me.

54
00:06:05,603 --> 00:06:08,436
Or want to make
any kind of commitment to me.

55
00:06:09,441 --> 00:06:12,137
I'm finished with you, Zack.

56
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:15,043
I'm completely finished with you.

57
00:06:15,113 --> 00:06:17,980
Why don't you just go find yourself
some other little girl to be your pet?

58
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:20,019
That shouldn't be
difficult for you.

59
00:06:20,085 --> 00:06:23,384
I've had it with you
and your fuckin' stupid radio shows.

60
00:06:23,455 --> 00:06:26,721
- This is really fuckin' boring!

61
00:06:41,408 --> 00:06:44,434
Okay. Okay.

62
00:06:44,512 --> 00:06:46,946
We're not gonna
talk about that right now.

63
00:06:54,255 --> 00:06:57,713
Look at you, Zack.
Look what you're doing to yourself.

64
00:06:59,395 --> 00:07:01,522
You're digging your own grave.

65
00:07:05,067 --> 00:07:07,831
Why can't you just
stay at one station a while?

66
00:07:10,607 --> 00:07:14,065
Why do you always gotta go
fuck up your own future, huh?

67
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:21,814
What are you so afraid of, Zack?

68
00:07:21,886 --> 00:07:26,289
Yeah, well, that's right, Laurette.
We can't live in the present forever.

69
00:07:28,459 --> 00:07:30,451
Shit.

70
00:07:32,364 --> 00:07:35,128
Okay, look, um,

71
00:07:43,976 --> 00:07:48,913
Maybe you should just go back
to New York or Detroit or Baltimore.

72
00:07:48,981 --> 00:07:51,974
You said you liked it there, remember?

73
00:07:54,721 --> 00:07:57,054
Go back to one of them stations
where you used to work...

74
00:07:57,124 --> 00:07:59,592
and ask them to give you
a second chance.

75
00:08:01,529 --> 00:08:04,828
There's nothing wrong
with asking somebody for somethin'.

76
00:08:05,966 --> 00:08:08,697
Why is that always
so fuckin' hard for you?

77
00:08:13,709 --> 00:08:15,801
You're a good D.J., Zack.

78
00:08:17,412 --> 00:08:20,575
All you got to do is learn
to jerk people off a little.

79
00:08:20,649 --> 00:08:22,845
That's all they really want,
you know.

80
00:08:26,222 --> 00:08:30,283
Well, I never jerk people off,
and you fuckin' know it, Laurette.

81
00:08:30,358 --> 00:08:33,295
Okay. Okay, fine. Forget it.

82
00:08:35,199 --> 00:08:38,099
I'm not talkin' to you
anymore, Zack. Okay?

83
00:08:38,167 --> 00:08:40,101
I'm not talkin' to you anymore...

84
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:42,104
because you don't want
to fuckin' be here.

85
00:08:42,172 --> 00:08:44,834
And I'm not gonna let you
play with me anymore!

86
00:08:52,817 --> 00:08:55,980
I hate you.
You're so damn stubborn and stupid.

87
00:08:56,054 --> 00:08:58,022
And I hate you.
I hate you.

88
00:08:58,089 --> 00:09:00,023
And I'm an idiot
for being with you.

89
00:09:00,091 --> 00:09:02,423
You got me embarrassed
on my own time.

90
00:09:05,364 --> 00:09:08,561
You got no fuckin' future,
Zack, especially not with me.

91
00:09:08,634 --> 00:09:10,568
Not the shoes.
Not the shoes.

92
00:09:10,637 --> 00:09:13,197
- Not the shoes.
- No?

93
00:09:13,273 --> 00:09:17,334
Come on, hit me, motherfucker!
Hit me! Hit me!

94
00:09:26,987 --> 00:09:29,285
I guess it's over
between us, Laurette.

95
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:04,819
You know, Jack, we could
get some money together.

96
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:07,416
Except you always blowin' it.

97
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:11,487
You know, gamblin',
gettin' high, showin' off.

98
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:13,555
I have to have fun,
you know, baby?

99
00:12:14,802 --> 00:12:17,498
Yeah, yeah, I know.

100
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:20,405
You always makin'
big, big plans for tomorrow.

101
00:12:20,475 --> 00:12:23,035
You wanna know why?

102
00:12:23,111 --> 00:12:25,238
'Cause you always fuckin' up today.

103
00:12:26,881 --> 00:12:30,511
Look at what happened to that white girl
Julie that you started out with.

104
00:12:30,586 --> 00:12:32,952
She is a mess now.

105
00:12:33,021 --> 00:12:37,459
All the girls you got
are so messed up, except me.

106
00:12:37,526 --> 00:12:42,157
I could tell you a lot of things about
yourself you never even thought about.

107
00:12:42,232 --> 00:12:44,530
Never even entered
your hatchet-shaped head.

108
00:12:45,768 --> 00:12:48,033
But, you know,
you never can be too sure.

109
00:12:49,539 --> 00:12:54,408
My mama used to say that
America is a big meltin' pot.

110
00:12:54,478 --> 00:12:57,140
Because she used to say
when you bring it to a boil,

111
00:12:57,214 --> 00:13:02,175
all the scum rises to the top.

112
00:13:02,252 --> 00:13:06,246
So maybe there's hope
for you yet, Jack.

113
00:13:08,726 --> 00:13:10,661
You listenin' to me?

114
00:13:12,431 --> 00:13:16,663
Shit. You don't understand
any kind of people.

115
00:13:16,735 --> 00:13:21,229
Maybe that's your problem.
You sure don't understand women at all.

116
00:13:21,307 --> 00:13:24,435
And a pimp is at least
supposed to understand women.

117
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:33,150
If you was a good pimp, you would have
hit me by now or done somethin'.

118
00:13:33,219 --> 00:13:36,280
But I can just lay here
and talk forever...

119
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,723
and you won't hear
a single word,

120
00:13:38,792 --> 00:13:42,320
like you don't even speak English.

121
00:13:42,396 --> 00:13:45,058
Lost inside all them plans you got.

122
00:13:45,132 --> 00:13:48,034
But I know about you, Jack.

123
00:13:48,103 --> 00:13:50,832
Jack.

124
00:13:50,905 --> 00:13:53,136
You sure can talk, can't you, baby?

125
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:05,744
- Yes?
- Hey, Jack. It's me, Gig.

126
00:14:05,822 --> 00:14:08,313
Ah, what do you want?
Man, I don't owe you anything.

127
00:14:08,391 --> 00:14:11,121
Man, I got something I know
you gonna be interested in, Jack.

128
00:14:11,194 --> 00:14:13,254
I doubt that very much.

129
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:15,058
- You busy?
- Yes.

130
00:14:15,131 --> 00:14:17,259
- I just want to come up
and talk to you, Jack.
- Uh-huh.

131
00:14:17,334 --> 00:14:20,792
- I wanna prove to you
I'm on your side, man.
- Uh-huh.

132
00:14:20,871 --> 00:14:24,238
- Don't you got just
five minutes to talk?
- No, I don't.

133
00:14:24,308 --> 00:14:27,506
- Come on, Jack.
- Just come up and make it short,
all right?

134
00:14:27,579 --> 00:14:29,570
- I'm on my way up.
- Yeah.

135
00:14:34,018 --> 00:14:36,145
Fatso's on his way up here.

136
00:14:41,193 --> 00:14:43,854
Cover up the merchandise.

137
00:14:45,431 --> 00:14:48,424
Just take this, in case he's gotten
any smarter lately, all right?

138
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:49,190
Hi, Jack. Where you at?

139
00:15:53,638 --> 00:15:55,628
Hi, babe.

140
00:15:57,576 --> 00:15:59,567
She nice.

141
00:16:01,447 --> 00:16:04,109
Jack, I know how you feel about me...

142
00:16:04,183 --> 00:16:06,242
after what happened
down in Jefferson Parish...

143
00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:09,982
with that spy boy,
and I don't blame you one bit.

144
00:16:10,056 --> 00:16:12,684
But you too serious.

145
00:16:12,758 --> 00:16:16,023
You gotta let
the past be the past, Jack.

146
00:16:17,598 --> 00:16:20,066
I come here tonight
to settle us up.

147
00:16:20,133 --> 00:16:22,101
Now how you gonna be
doin' that, fathead?

148
00:16:22,169 --> 00:16:26,469
By doin' you a favor, a really big favor.
I'm as serious as cancer.

149
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:29,475
Man, whatever this is,
I know it's bullshit.

150
00:16:29,543 --> 00:16:33,946
Jack, I have been tryin' to find a way
to straighten us out,

151
00:16:34,015 --> 00:16:36,677
and I finally come up with it.

152
00:16:36,751 --> 00:16:41,814
- Please, let bygones be bygones.

153
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:46,054
Man, I can see why you might
wanna be on my good side.

154
00:16:46,128 --> 00:16:50,189
You wanna do me a favor 'cause you know...
you know I'm gonna be big...

155
00:16:50,267 --> 00:16:53,724
- and you wanna be in on it.
- All right, it's no secret.

156
00:16:53,802 --> 00:16:55,862
I know where you're headed.

157
00:16:55,939 --> 00:16:59,773
But just hear me out,
see my little gift,

158
00:16:59,843 --> 00:17:03,370
- and then if you're not interested,
let me know.
- What's the gift?

159
00:17:03,446 --> 00:17:05,471
Oh, man, you gonna die.

160
00:17:05,548 --> 00:17:09,713
I have got a piece of chicken you ain't
even gonna believe is from this planet.

161
00:17:09,787 --> 00:17:14,656
- No, that I might believe.
- Oh, Jack, be serious, man.

162
00:17:14,725 --> 00:17:18,320
This girl is 19.
A beautiful white girl.

163
00:17:18,396 --> 00:17:23,231
A Cajun goddess, man.
A Cajun goddess.

164
00:17:23,302 --> 00:17:26,396
I got her up at
the Belle Chasse Hotel right now.

165
00:17:26,471 --> 00:17:28,632
And she's waiting there
for you, Jack.

166
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:34,077
My gift to you. The most beautifulest
gift that I could possibly give you.

167
00:17:34,146 --> 00:17:37,116
I mean, I can't believe you think
I'm gonna fall for this.

168
00:17:38,384 --> 00:17:41,911
Hey, go over there, check it out.

169
00:17:41,988 --> 00:17:47,052
If I'm crazy or lyin',
you don't lose nothin'.

170
00:17:47,127 --> 00:17:50,857
Matter of fact, I just wanted
to give you first shot at her,

171
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:54,868
before she all used up,
because she is gorgeous, man.

172
00:17:54,935 --> 00:17:56,926
Then why don't you want her, man?

173
00:17:57,004 --> 00:17:59,098
Why don't you give her
to one of your so-called real friends,

174
00:17:59,174 --> 00:18:01,301
one of those assholes
down on Decatur Street, huh?

175
00:18:01,376 --> 00:18:04,174
Because I've been trying
to make us be friends again.

176
00:18:04,245 --> 00:18:06,372
Can't you just accept that?

177
00:18:09,951 --> 00:18:12,146
All right. And I suppose
you haven't even touched her, right?

178
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,754
All right, I'll go look
at your martian goddess.

179
00:18:16,826 --> 00:18:19,351
But I'm telling you something.
If you're foolin' with me,

180
00:18:19,428 --> 00:18:23,024
if you're wastin' my time, if anythin',
I'm gonna fuck you up.

181
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,034
I guarantee it.

182
00:18:25,102 --> 00:18:28,868
Jack, nobody's gonna regret anythin',
especially not you.

183
00:18:28,939 --> 00:18:30,873
In fact, you're gonna
thank me for this.

184
00:18:30,941 --> 00:18:33,341
You're gonna remember me
for the rest of your life for this.

185
00:18:33,411 --> 00:18:35,401
Yeah? Okay.

186
00:19:08,047 --> 00:19:11,448
- You makin' any money, baby?
- Ain't nothin' happenin'.

187
00:19:11,518 --> 00:19:14,886
- Pretty thing like you? Why not?
- I don't know.

188
00:19:16,456 --> 00:19:19,051
- All right. Check you out later.
- All right, Jack.

189
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:24,890
- Hey, L.C. What's happenin'?
- Hey, Jack. Good to see you.

190
00:19:24,966 --> 00:19:26,900
Out kinda early this evenin', huh?

191
00:19:26,968 --> 00:19:29,937
- Yeah. I got some things to check out.
- How's the ladies treatin' you?

192
00:19:30,005 --> 00:19:32,599
- Ow.
- Well, you know, Jack, how that goes.

193
00:19:32,674 --> 00:19:36,007
If you get enough of it,
do like a crawfish. Back on out of it.

194
00:19:36,078 --> 00:19:38,546
- I'll see you, L.C.
- All right. Take care, Jack.

195
00:19:44,954 --> 00:19:47,582
- Hey, Julie. How's it goin'?
- All right.

196
00:19:47,657 --> 00:19:49,648
Hang in there now.

197
00:20:30,403 --> 00:20:32,667
I heard you're lookin'
for someone to take care of you.

198
00:20:36,644 --> 00:20:39,737
Now what you want is someone
who's gonna treat you like a lady.

199
00:20:39,813 --> 00:20:44,444
I don't know if you've been on the streets
here or not, but they can be very serious.

200
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:46,851
These guys...

201
00:20:46,921 --> 00:20:50,221
I mean, chances are you're
gonna find somebody
who's gonna get you strung out...

202
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:53,056
'cause he's strung out,
and then he's gonna own you.

203
00:20:54,496 --> 00:20:56,555
Some guy's gonna cut you,
and hurt you.

204
00:20:58,267 --> 00:21:01,930
With me, you're gonna be makin' money.
You're gonna have jewelry.

205
00:21:02,004 --> 00:21:06,703
Whatever you want. Check it out.
I got the right connects.

206
00:21:06,775 --> 00:21:09,243
My thing is organized.

207
00:21:09,312 --> 00:21:12,577
You work with me,
I'm gonna take care of you.

208
00:21:12,649 --> 00:21:15,210
Don't shoot me! Don't...

209
00:21:17,354 --> 00:21:19,948
- Where you at, Jack?
- Mandino, what are you doin'?

210
00:21:20,024 --> 00:21:22,117
Man, I'm here with my girlfriend.

211
00:21:28,667 --> 00:21:32,295
This is ridiculous, man.
What are you tryin' to pull on me?

212
00:21:33,438 --> 00:21:35,496
Jack.

213
00:21:35,574 --> 00:21:39,010
Jack, Jack.
You're a sick son of a bitch.

214
00:21:41,179 --> 00:21:44,547
- Is that your girlfriend?
- Man, you know I'm not
into this kinda... Ow!

215
00:21:44,617 --> 00:21:47,609
Get this son of a bitch out of here.
Get this pervert out of here!

216
00:21:49,388 --> 00:21:51,583
Shit.

217
00:21:54,694 --> 00:21:56,925
Okay, Rich.

218
00:21:56,997 --> 00:21:59,624
I'll take care of the kid.

219
00:22:02,603 --> 00:22:05,198
It's okay, darlin'.
Everything's all right.

220
00:22:08,543 --> 00:22:10,602
It's all over now.

221
00:22:12,413 --> 00:22:17,350
Look, we're just gonna...
we're gonna sit here for a little while,

222
00:22:17,418 --> 00:22:20,285
and then you're gonna...
you're gonna come with me.

223
00:22:21,723 --> 00:22:24,716
Now, I don't want you
to worry about anything, understand?

224
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:31,028
Don't worry about a thing,
because I'm gonna take care of you.

225
00:23:00,298 --> 00:23:02,698
And she said

226
00:23:05,537 --> 00:23:09,872
- Well, where you were

227
00:23:09,942 --> 00:23:14,106
Oh, baby, don't go slow

228
00:23:15,281 --> 00:23:18,546
- Take me now

229
00:23:18,618 --> 00:23:22,384
Oh, she don't know

230
00:23:22,456 --> 00:23:25,653
Is a sad and beautiful world.

231
00:23:25,726 --> 00:23:28,820
- Huh?

232
00:23:28,896 --> 00:23:32,662
Yeah, it's a sad
and beautiful world, pal.

233
00:23:33,835 --> 00:23:35,995
That's a good one.

234
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,035
Yeah, yeah

235
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:45,511
Ah, buzz off, pal.

236
00:23:45,581 --> 00:23:48,743
Thank you.
Buzz offa to you too.

237
00:23:51,821 --> 00:23:53,754
No, buzz off.

238
00:23:53,823 --> 00:23:56,656
- Ah, buzz off. Ah, buzz off.
- Buzz off.

239
00:23:56,726 --> 00:24:00,025
Buzz off. Buzz off.

240
00:24:00,096 --> 00:24:04,898
Buzz off. Buzz... off.

241
00:24:04,968 --> 00:24:07,198
Good evening.
Buzz off to everybody.

242
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:10,001
Oh, thank you. Buzz off to you too.
Oh, uh, it's a pleasure.

243
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:12,008
Thank you.

244
00:24:17,115 --> 00:24:20,846
Oh, lady, now, now

245
00:24:20,918 --> 00:24:25,686
It's a sad and beautiful world

246
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:31,756
It's a sad and beautiful world

247
00:24:31,831 --> 00:24:36,894
It is a sad and beautiful world, yeah

248
00:24:38,203 --> 00:24:42,607
It's a sad and beautiful world

249
00:24:43,843 --> 00:24:48,940
It's a sad and beautiful world

250
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:52,880
Now

251
00:24:52,952 --> 00:24:57,049
To the end

252
00:24:57,124 --> 00:25:00,958
She's just
She's just a shadow, baby

253
00:25:01,028 --> 00:25:03,862
Zack. My man.

254
00:25:05,367 --> 00:25:08,803
What the fuck you doin'
out here in the garbage?

255
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:10,963
Just leave me alone, Preston.

256
00:25:14,043 --> 00:25:16,136
I'm in a bad mood.

257
00:25:16,212 --> 00:25:18,806
Well, I'm just the man
you've been lookin' for.

258
00:25:18,881 --> 00:25:22,146
In fact, I been lookin' for you.

259
00:25:22,218 --> 00:25:26,780
- That's a bad sign.
- Now, Zack, baby.

260
00:25:26,857 --> 00:25:29,325
I got somethin' real good for you.

261
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,696
An hour's work
for a whole lot of scratch.

262
00:25:33,764 --> 00:25:37,860
- I ain't interested, man.
- Man, you are in a bad mood.

263
00:25:37,935 --> 00:25:41,463
- You ain't even let me
propose this shit to you.

264
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:44,406
Just listen to me
for one minute, will you?

265
00:25:44,475 --> 00:25:47,706
One minute of your, uh,
valuable time.

266
00:25:50,615 --> 00:25:54,017
- Just fuck off, Preston.

267
00:25:59,792 --> 00:26:03,091
All I want to do
is pay you a grand...

268
00:26:03,162 --> 00:26:08,566
in exchange for a single hour
of your very, very valuable time.

269
00:26:08,635 --> 00:26:13,095
Now this ain't no breaking and entering
or small-time chump change.

270
00:26:13,173 --> 00:26:18,236
No delivery of controlled substances.
None of that stuff.

271
00:26:18,311 --> 00:26:23,807
This is just to drive a car
from one part of town to the other, alone.

272
00:26:26,521 --> 00:26:28,819
That's it.

273
00:26:28,891 --> 00:26:32,292
Well, what kind of car
would that be, Preston?

274
00:26:32,361 --> 00:26:36,889
- That would be a very nice car.

275
00:26:36,965 --> 00:26:40,992
A very nice, very expensive
imported car...

276
00:26:41,069 --> 00:26:44,528
which just happens to be
between owners at the present time.

277
00:26:44,607 --> 00:26:48,236
Oh, I see.
Just in between owners.

278
00:26:48,311 --> 00:26:52,043
Look, all you got to do, man,
is drive the car across town,

279
00:26:52,116 --> 00:26:54,812
park it, leave it.

280
00:26:54,885 --> 00:26:57,944
And, look, I'm gonna
give you half up front and half later.

281
00:26:58,021 --> 00:27:01,048
The whole thing's over in an hour.

282
00:27:01,125 --> 00:27:04,617
Very safe, very clean.

283
00:27:04,696 --> 00:27:08,826
And believe me, I could get
a million guys to do this for me.

284
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:12,199
Well, then, why don't you
do it yourself?

285
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:16,934
I'm offering a grand so I don't have
to answer stupid questions like that.

286
00:27:19,344 --> 00:27:24,339
Well, I might consider a grand up front.

287
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:28,950
Then I might think about it.

288
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:31,012
Jesus Christ.

289
00:27:36,263 --> 00:27:39,426
Zack, you are in a nasty mood.

290
00:27:40,768 --> 00:27:44,169
Now, just to make you
cheer up a little bit,

291
00:27:44,238 --> 00:27:48,834
- I'll give you 750 in front, okay?
- Shit.

292
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:53,541
All right, all right,
Mr. Almighty Hot Shit.

293
00:27:53,615 --> 00:27:55,640
Look, I'm gonna do you this favor.

294
00:27:57,752 --> 00:28:00,847
Oh, man. AJaguar, huh?

295
00:28:03,959 --> 00:28:07,725
Look, man, I'm gonna
give you the whole thing, up front.

296
00:28:09,366 --> 00:28:11,356
And you gonna owe me one.

297
00:28:18,174 --> 00:28:21,633
Zack, you can buy yourself
20 girls for all of that.

298
00:28:26,884 --> 00:28:29,546
Yeah, sure, man.

299
00:28:37,796 --> 00:28:40,264
Then she said what

300
00:28:40,332 --> 00:28:44,029
I just want to know

301
00:28:44,102 --> 00:28:46,866
Shoop, shoop

302
00:28:46,938 --> 00:28:49,772
Shoop, shoop

303
00:28:49,842 --> 00:28:52,936
-  Shoop

304
00:28:57,784 --> 00:28:59,776
Motherfucker.

305
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:06,854
Take it slow

306
00:29:08,595 --> 00:29:11,258
All right, baby. You got it.

307
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:25,672
- How you doin', baby?

308
00:29:25,747 --> 00:29:28,012
All right. Shit.

309
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:39,651
Well, I ain't goin' back to Detroit,
and that's for damn sure.

310
00:29:41,498 --> 00:29:43,489
Shit.

311
00:29:45,035 --> 00:29:47,663
You can bet your ass I'm a good D.J.

312
00:29:50,675 --> 00:29:55,305
Shit. WWOZ, WHLO.

313
00:29:57,181 --> 00:30:00,242
WAKR. Just check it out.

314
00:30:06,425 --> 00:30:11,261
Oh, we're comin' up on the midnight hour
here on the Lee Baby Simms Show.

315
00:30:12,498 --> 00:30:15,399
Yeah.

316
00:30:15,468 --> 00:30:20,098
Well, it's a Tuesday night.
Gimme a call down here at the station.

317
00:30:20,173 --> 00:30:24,234
Our lines are open. Let the Lee Baby
know that you still love him.

318
00:30:28,348 --> 00:30:30,408
Yeah.

319
00:30:30,484 --> 00:30:33,942
I'm gonna be sending
this one out to, uh...

320
00:30:34,021 --> 00:30:36,012
out to you, Laurette.

321
00:30:40,228 --> 00:30:43,527
I was all right

322
00:30:43,598 --> 00:30:46,396
For a while

323
00:30:46,468 --> 00:30:50,701
I could smile
I could smile

324
00:31:11,328 --> 00:31:13,320
You in the Jag. Pull it over.

325
00:31:13,397 --> 00:31:15,491
Son of a bitch.

326
00:31:19,771 --> 00:31:22,035
Out of the car, asshole. Out!

327
00:31:23,942 --> 00:31:26,740
Get your ass out of there.

328
00:31:26,811 --> 00:31:28,803
What?

329
00:31:30,848 --> 00:31:34,340
- Was I goin' a little too fast?
- Hands up on the hood, jackass! Move!

330
00:31:36,355 --> 00:31:39,257
- Move!
- Spread 'em out.

331
00:31:39,326 --> 00:31:41,794
Come on, get a little
goosey-goosey goin' here.

332
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:45,159
- What are you lookin' at?
- Your ugly face.

333
00:31:45,231 --> 00:31:47,529
- Hook him up.
- Oh, hook him up.

334
00:31:47,601 --> 00:31:50,001
Hook him good.
Twist it a little bit.

335
00:31:50,071 --> 00:31:52,095
Watch it, rookie.

336
00:31:54,441 --> 00:31:57,900
- I ain't done nothin'.
- Get your ass back. Get your ass back.

337
00:31:57,978 --> 00:32:01,746
I don't care if you done nothin'.
Let's see what we got here.

338
00:32:01,816 --> 00:32:04,047
- It's my car.
- It's your ass.

339
00:32:04,119 --> 00:32:07,418
- Shit. What are you lookin' at, dogface?
- Shut up.

340
00:32:09,258 --> 00:32:11,954
- Maybe we get a little
lagniappe in the trunk.
- Oh, yeah?

341
00:32:12,027 --> 00:32:14,086
You got nothin' on me.

342
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:25,464
- He's the one, Herb.
- It's all wrong, man.

343
00:32:25,541 --> 00:32:29,602
Put the smart-ass in the car.

344
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,704
- In the car. No, asshole!
- Come on!

345
00:32:31,781 --> 00:32:34,410
- You set me up! You set me up!
- Come on!

346
00:32:34,485 --> 00:32:37,147
- In the car, asshole!
- You motherfucker!

347
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:39,849
You set me up!

348
00:32:39,923 --> 00:32:41,914
You son of a bitch!

349
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:20,561
- Hey, baby.
- Yeah, right.

350
00:35:27,171 --> 00:35:29,161
In here.

351
00:35:37,182 --> 00:35:40,083
Excuse me.
Now can I get a light for my cigarette?

352
00:35:40,151 --> 00:35:43,212
- Didn't I give you
a match this morning?
- That was five, six hours ago.

353
00:35:43,288 --> 00:35:46,519
- I'll be back in a couple ofhours.
- Man, come on.

354
00:35:57,804 --> 00:35:59,796
Shit.

355
00:36:30,673 --> 00:36:33,403
Guard!
I need a light here!

356
00:36:35,511 --> 00:36:37,775
I can't believe this.

357
00:36:37,848 --> 00:36:42,375
Guard! Guard! Guard! Guard!
Guard! Guard! Guard!

358
00:36:44,988 --> 00:36:47,149
What am I doin' in here?

359
00:36:50,794 --> 00:36:53,059
Can't you see?

360
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:57,227
You are not
the only innocent asshole in here.

361
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:03,030
I was set up too.

362
00:37:04,977 --> 00:37:06,968
Just like you.

363
00:37:08,714 --> 00:37:10,409
Just like you.

364
00:37:10,482 --> 00:37:12,746
Man, I am not just like you,
whatever you say.

365
00:37:12,818 --> 00:37:14,844
I don't even want to deal with you.
You got it, man?

366
00:37:14,921 --> 00:37:18,288
As far as I'm concerned,
you don't even exist. Not at all.

367
00:37:19,325 --> 00:37:21,317
Got it?

368
00:37:40,748 --> 00:37:42,740
Well, you don't exist either.

369
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:53,451
The walls don't exist.

370
00:37:55,764 --> 00:37:57,858
The floor doesn't exist.

371
00:38:00,303 --> 00:38:04,570
This prison's not here.
These bunks aren't here.

372
00:38:08,811 --> 00:38:10,745
The bars aren't here.

373
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:15,477
None of this is really here.

374
00:38:21,025 --> 00:38:23,017
None of this is really here at all.

375
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:33,934
What's the matter with you, man?

376
00:38:34,006 --> 00:38:36,337
Huh?
What's goin' on inside there?

377
00:38:38,711 --> 00:38:40,702
You haven't said nothin'
in three days.

378
00:38:42,014 --> 00:38:44,778
Man, you gotta say somethin'.
Just say somethin'.

379
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,145
Fuck you.

380
00:38:51,591 --> 00:38:54,321
Fuck you. Fuck you.
Fuck you. Fuck you.

381
00:38:54,394 --> 00:38:57,625
Okay, fuck you.
That's fine.

382
00:39:01,302 --> 00:39:03,293
You piss me off, you know that?

383
00:39:09,377 --> 00:39:11,675
Man, you know what I'm gonna do
when I get out of here?

384
00:39:14,215 --> 00:39:16,241
When I get out of here,

385
00:39:19,421 --> 00:39:21,356
there's gonna be a white limousine.

386
00:39:21,423 --> 00:39:24,984
It's gonna come and pick me up.

387
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:27,052
It's gonna be a Lincoln.

388
00:39:28,431 --> 00:39:30,422
I'm gonna step inside...

389
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:36,870
and inside it's bigger than you could
possibly imagine it from the outside.

390
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:43,111
And there's gonna be beautiful girls
in there, four of'em,

391
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:45,171
and they're all gonna be naked.

392
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:51,883
And one of'em's gonna
offer me some coke.

393
00:39:53,024 --> 00:39:55,015
But I'm gonna just say no.

394
00:39:58,965 --> 00:40:04,130
I'm gonna just be enjoying
the luxury of the car and the girls.

395
00:40:05,338 --> 00:40:07,636
And the door's gonna close,

396
00:40:07,708 --> 00:40:09,698
and it's just gonna go "click."

397
00:40:10,811 --> 00:40:12,745
And there's gonna be
music playin'.

398
00:40:12,813 --> 00:40:15,782
It's like music
I never heard before.

399
00:40:18,685 --> 00:40:21,518
And then the car's gonna start up,

400
00:40:21,588 --> 00:40:26,322
and it's gonna drive slowly
towards the city, very slowly.

401
00:40:26,394 --> 00:40:29,454
It's gonna be beautiful, man.

402
00:40:29,531 --> 00:40:31,692
Yes.

403
00:40:33,635 --> 00:40:36,763
- You're such an asshole.
- What?

404
00:40:39,441 --> 00:40:42,672
- You're an asshole.
- Yeah, why am I an asshole, huh?

405
00:40:42,745 --> 00:40:45,077
Why am I an asshole?

406
00:40:45,147 --> 00:40:48,982
'Cause you imagine
all this insane shit...

407
00:40:49,051 --> 00:40:53,614
like you were...
Bebe Rebozo or something.

408
00:40:53,689 --> 00:40:57,251
Yeah?
Who's Bebe Rebozo?

409
00:40:59,863 --> 00:41:01,855
Zack, who's Bebe Rebozo?

410
00:41:07,438 --> 00:41:09,429
What'd you do on the outside?

411
00:41:12,009 --> 00:41:14,569
You were a garbage man, right?

412
00:41:14,645 --> 00:41:16,943
I wasn't no garbage man.

413
00:41:17,014 --> 00:41:19,006
Well, what'd you do then?

414
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,950
- I was a D.J.
- What?

415
00:41:25,824 --> 00:41:28,054
- I was a D.J.
- A music D.J.?

416
00:41:29,529 --> 00:41:32,657
- Yeah.
- Nah, man. I don't believe it. Really?

417
00:41:32,732 --> 00:41:35,724
What station? I listen to the radio.
I must have heard you.

418
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:40,836
Shit. WYLD.

419
00:41:42,209 --> 00:41:45,303
- Lee Baby Simms.
- You're Lee Baby Simms?

420
00:41:45,379 --> 00:41:47,677
- No.
- Yeah.

421
00:41:47,748 --> 00:41:50,775
- You heard of me?
- Nope.

422
00:41:50,851 --> 00:41:53,616
- Fuck you.

423
00:41:53,688 --> 00:41:56,623
Ah, I can't believe it.
I got a D.J. In here with me?

424
00:41:56,691 --> 00:41:58,625
I think that's unbelievable, man.

425
00:41:58,693 --> 00:42:01,753
Why don't you do, like,
a little, you know...

426
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:04,094
a thing, you know, a talk?

427
00:42:04,165 --> 00:42:07,329
I don't feel like it.

428
00:42:07,403 --> 00:42:11,271
Come on, man.
Do, you know, do the weather or something.

429
00:42:15,311 --> 00:42:18,678
Man, what's it like outside?
Why don't you tell me that?

430
00:42:18,748 --> 00:42:21,240
- Cold.
- What else? Come on,
tell me some stuff, you know?

431
00:42:21,317 --> 00:42:25,652
Go ahead, do the thing.
Come on. Go.

432
00:42:27,258 --> 00:42:29,385
All right. Okay.

433
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:32,087
All right.

434
00:42:36,234 --> 00:42:38,464
Let's see, um,

435
00:42:38,536 --> 00:42:40,527
okay.

436
00:42:41,739 --> 00:42:44,538
"Well, we got about 12 below
the big red line.

437
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:48,943
"Slick icy road conditions
out there tonight, Bob. You betcha.

438
00:42:49,014 --> 00:42:51,676
"All you holiday travelers beware.

439
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:56,381
"Looks like we got
about a four-car pileup
out there on the airline highway.

440
00:42:56,456 --> 00:42:58,389
"I'm gonna switch over
to our mobile unit now.

441
00:42:58,458 --> 00:43:01,552
Chip, what does it
look like out there to you."
It was that type of thing.

442
00:43:01,628 --> 00:43:04,189
- Come on, do some more. That was cool.
- Weather and bullshit.

443
00:43:04,264 --> 00:43:07,597
- Do some more. Come on.
- Nah.

444
00:43:07,667 --> 00:43:10,034
Do some more.

445
00:43:10,104 --> 00:43:12,038
All right, okay.

446
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,536
Let's see.

447
00:43:15,609 --> 00:43:19,409
All right. Uh...

448
00:43:21,082 --> 00:43:23,642
Uh... okay.

449
00:43:27,189 --> 00:43:31,683
"Well, we got about 10:43...
coming up on 10:43
here in the Crescent City.

450

"We're goin' around
and around with the big sound

You got the Lee Baby Simms Show.

Man, what is wrong with you?

And why don't you take a flying fuck?

480

If looks can kill, I am dead now.

Excuse me.

Not enough room to swing a cat.

489
00:49:07,890 --> 00:49:09,880
Cat. The animal.

490
00:49:23,139 --> 00:49:25,165
- Excuse me, Jack...

491
00:49:25,242 --> 00:49:30,043

Do you have some cigarette?

492
00:49:30,114 --> 00:49:32,105

493
00:49:33,817 --> 00:49:36,378

Do you have, uh, Zack, some cigarette?

496
00:49:49,235 --> 00:49:51,203
I'm Jack.
Get it straight.

00:49:51,270 --> 00:49:53,431
Yes. Got it straight.

498
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:02,307
But do you have some cigarette?

499
00:50:02,382 --> 00:50:04,714
Cigarettes won't help with hiccups.
Not in this country.

00:50:34,650 --> 00:50:37,312
Jack, do you have some fire?

505
00:50:37,386 --> 00:50:39,378

506
00:50:47,764 --> 00:50:50,131
- Excuse me, Jack, do... Zack!

507
00:50:50,201 --> 00:50:54,035

508
00:50:54,104 --> 00:50:56,868
Do you have some fire?

509
00:50:56,941 --> 00:51:00,844
No. Matches aren't allowed here.

510
00:51:00,911 --> 00:51:03,812
Do you understand?

511
00:51:03,882 --> 00:51:05,873
Yes.
Yes, I see.

512
00:51:09,654 --> 00:51:11,589
I see.

513
00:51:29,710 --> 00:51:31,904
Do you like Walt Whitman?

514
00:51:31,978 --> 00:51:36,211
Yes, I like Walt Whitman very much.
Leaves of "Glass."

515
00:51:37,985 --> 00:51:39,920
What?

516
00:51:39,987 --> 00:51:42,889
Nothing. I said,
"Do you like Walt Whitman?"

517
00:51:48,429 --> 00:51:52,799
- Walt Whitman?
- Yes. I like Walt Whitman very much.

518
00:51:52,868 --> 00:51:55,928
Very good, the Leaves of "Glass."

519
00:51:56,005 --> 00:51:58,064
Leaves of "Glass."

520
00:52:06,883 --> 00:52:08,874
Walt Whitman.

521
00:52:13,957 --> 00:52:15,949
Walt Whitman.

522
00:52:45,959 --> 00:52:49,417
Zaaa-ta.

523
00:52:56,603 --> 00:52:59,903
- What the hell are you doin'?

524
00:53:23,098 --> 00:53:26,591
- Bob? Bob?
- Yes?

525
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:28,660
What the hell are you doin'?

526
00:53:31,841 --> 00:53:35,938
I make "hay" window.
Huh?

527
00:53:36,013 --> 00:53:38,004
That's good, Bob.

528
00:53:40,083 --> 00:53:44,214
Excuse me. Do you say
in English, "I look "hat" the window,"

529
00:53:44,288 --> 00:53:48,621
or do you say in English,
"I look "hout" the window"?

530
00:53:48,693 --> 00:53:52,561
Well, in this case, Bob, I'm afraid
you gotta say, "I look at the window."

531
00:54:16,389 --> 00:54:21,292
So, uh, Za... Jack.
Jack, why-why are you put in this place?

532
00:54:22,830 --> 00:54:25,458
I don't know, Bob. It was, like,
voodoo or something, you know?

533
00:54:27,768 --> 00:54:31,795
I was framed. I'm completely
innocent. You understand?

534
00:54:31,872 --> 00:54:35,309
- Yes. You are innocent man. I understand.
- Yeah.

535
00:54:39,114 --> 00:54:42,982
And you, my friend, Zack,
why are you put in this prison?

536
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:47,412
I was set up, Bob.

537
00:54:49,258 --> 00:54:51,419
- Just likeJack.
- Mm.

538
00:54:55,299 --> 00:54:58,359
- I "ham" an innocent man.

539
00:55:00,404 --> 00:55:05,068
I see.
You too are an innocent man.

540
00:55:11,014 --> 00:55:14,781
So, Bob,
for why are you in this prison put?

541
00:55:16,121 --> 00:55:19,284
Me? I killed "hay" man.

542
00:55:37,310 --> 00:55:39,335
You killed a man, huh?

543
00:55:46,353 --> 00:55:48,651
What'd you do that for, Bob?

544
00:55:48,722 --> 00:55:52,181
- The guy didn't like Walt Whitman?

545
00:55:56,030 --> 00:55:59,262
I never asked this man
if he liked Walt Whitman.

546
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:07,604
Come on, Bob.
Why'd you kill a man?

547
00:56:08,977 --> 00:56:13,608
I, uh... We-We was, uh,
playing-a card.

548
00:56:13,682 --> 00:56:17,881
No? Table. I have no money,
but I am a cheater.

549
00:56:17,954 --> 00:56:20,047
- Yeah?
- Very good.

550
00:56:20,123 --> 00:56:23,787
But I don't know...
I don't know why they...

551
00:56:23,861 --> 00:56:27,695
they notice after a while
l-l-l-I am a cheater.

552
00:56:27,765 --> 00:56:30,359
- It's strange, really. I'm a good cheater.

553
00:56:30,434 --> 00:56:35,428
They notice, and I run, run away,
and they run back me, yes.

554
00:56:35,507 --> 00:56:39,966
In another room with the billiard,
pool... the pool, no?

555
00:56:40,044 --> 00:56:42,342
There. And, uh, and, uh...

556
00:56:42,413 --> 00:56:44,609
But I was very fast, very speedy.

557
00:56:44,683 --> 00:56:48,676
And they for stop me,
take a ball... take ball... many ball.

558
00:56:50,222 --> 00:56:53,124
Very "closed."
Ta! Ta! Ta!

559
00:56:53,192 --> 00:56:57,322
And l... You...
You throw ball against me,

560
00:56:57,396 --> 00:56:59,455
I throw ball against you, no?

561
00:56:59,532 --> 00:57:04,663
I take one ball... a number eight.
Very good ball. Black ball.

562
00:57:04,737 --> 00:57:07,228
Ta! Tum! Ta!

563
00:57:07,307 --> 00:57:09,775
In the ground.
First stroke. Ha!

564
00:57:11,378 --> 00:57:14,211
Dead. Very big man.

565
00:57:14,281 --> 00:57:16,614
On the ground.
First stroke.

566
00:57:16,684 --> 00:57:21,178
Is that true, Bob?
This is a true story?

567
00:57:21,256 --> 00:57:24,748
- True story? Yeah, true story.
- Yeah.

568
00:57:27,128 --> 00:57:32,123
True story.
Very true story.

569
00:57:32,201 --> 00:57:35,693
On the ground, the first stroke.

570
00:57:35,771 --> 00:57:39,434
You throw the ball against me?

571
00:57:39,508 --> 00:57:41,500
I throw ball against you.

572
00:57:43,113 --> 00:57:46,947
But I "ham" no criminal.
I "ham" a good egg.

573
00:57:50,353 --> 00:57:53,881
I am a good egg. Jesus.

574
00:57:53,958 --> 00:57:57,485
Yes. I "ham" a good egg.

575
00:57:57,560 --> 00:58:01,554
Yes. We are.
We are a good egg.

576
00:58:03,267 --> 00:58:05,929
- My friends.
- Get off.

577
00:58:26,055 --> 00:58:28,217
Yes.

578
00:58:33,262 --> 00:58:37,529
- Watch out for Bob. He may be cheating.

579
00:58:37,601 --> 00:58:40,195
Is no joke.
Look where I am.

580
00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:42,262
Is no funny.

581
00:58:45,910 --> 00:58:48,572
- I have two pair. Two pair.
- What?

582
00:58:50,915 --> 00:58:53,076
- What do you got?
- Nothing.

583
00:58:53,152 --> 00:58:55,848
- Of course.
- Nothing.

584
00:58:55,921 --> 00:58:57,319
Ahhh-ha.

585
00:59:00,359 --> 00:59:04,352

- We all scream for ice cream.

613
01:01:05,627 --> 01:01:08,619
- I scream, you scream...
- Put a lid on it.

614
01:01:08,698 --> 01:01:10,688
- Put a lid on it.
- All right, quiet!

615
01:01:10,766 --> 01:01:13,599
Kill the noise.
Let's go. Kill the noise.

616
01:01:49,242 --> 01:01:54,236
Today, today in the yard,
I make a discovery. Very interesting.

617
01:01:57,817 --> 01:02:02,653
And I think, uh, I think
a film I have seen in Italy.

618
01:02:02,723 --> 01:02:05,385
An American film,
very good, lots of action.

619
01:02:08,829 --> 01:02:12,664
"Hit" was a prison film.

620
01:02:12,734 --> 01:02:16,397
When, uh, with...

621
01:02:16,471 --> 01:02:20,464
H-how do you say
in English, when, uh...

622
01:02:20,542 --> 01:02:23,477
when the man go out
of the prison, running away?

623
01:02:23,545 --> 01:02:28,882
- Escape. Escape.
- What? Escape.

624
01:02:28,951 --> 01:02:31,613
Escape. Yes, escape.

625
01:02:33,722 --> 01:02:36,885
Today in the yard,
I discover a way.

626
01:02:40,430 --> 01:02:45,424
Bob, there's no way you could escape
from the yard. There's no way.

627
01:02:46,937 --> 01:02:48,906
Forget it.

628
01:02:48,972 --> 01:02:51,463
Yes. Yes.

629
01:02:51,542 --> 01:02:55,706
Not from the yard.
To the yard.

630
01:03:02,387 --> 01:03:06,379
If there was a way to get out of here,
we would know about it.

631
01:03:06,457 --> 01:03:08,790
It's your turn.

632
01:03:11,830 --> 01:03:14,993
Come on, Bob.
It's no time for a joke.

633
01:03:15,067 --> 01:03:17,467
"Come on, Bob.
It's no time for a joke?"

634
01:03:17,536 --> 01:03:19,562
But I am no joke.

635
01:03:19,639 --> 01:03:22,130
I am very serious.

636
01:03:25,645 --> 01:03:28,136
I am sure.

637
01:03:37,057 --> 01:03:39,548
Here they come.

638
01:03:44,365 --> 01:03:46,334
Okay, you two.

639
01:03:46,401 --> 01:03:49,234
Time for your walk.

640
01:03:49,304 --> 01:03:51,500
Not you, shorty.
It ain't your turn.

641
01:03:51,574 --> 01:03:53,803
Come on. Let's go.

642
01:03:55,411 --> 01:03:58,744
But I no go for four days!
I no go. I missed my turn.

643
01:04:01,250 --> 01:04:03,515
Really, no joke.
I "ham" a good egg.

644
01:04:03,586 --> 01:04:06,555
I no go for four days.
Four days. I missed my turn.

645
01:04:06,623 --> 01:04:08,954
All right, all right,
Leonardo Da Vinci. Come on.

646
01:04:09,025 --> 01:04:10,959
Grazie, grazie.

647
01:05:11,093 --> 01:05:15,587
We... We have escaped
like in the American movies.

648
01:05:20,570 --> 01:05:25,906
- Hey. Shh!

649
01:05:25,975 --> 01:05:28,808
Yeah, man.
Out of the frying pan and into the fire.

650
01:05:53,772 --> 01:05:55,706
We could actually make it.

651
01:05:57,609 --> 01:05:59,942
- We gotta cross the river.

652
01:06:00,012 --> 01:06:03,675
It's our only chance
of losing the scent of the dogs.

653
01:06:03,749 --> 01:06:06,240
- Ah, yeah, yeah. This part I remember.

654
01:06:06,319 --> 01:06:09,982
Shut up.

655
01:06:10,056 --> 01:06:12,217
But I cannot swim.

656
01:06:13,327 --> 01:06:15,487
Oh, man.

657
01:06:15,561 --> 01:06:17,723
Shit!

658
01:06:17,798 --> 01:06:21,791
We gotta do it.
We gotta cross.

659
01:06:21,869 --> 01:06:26,863
Maybe Mark Twain will come by
and pick you up in a steamboat.

660
01:06:26,940 --> 01:06:31,275
I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry.

661
01:06:31,346 --> 01:06:35,943
My-My friends, wait!
No time for a joke. I cannot swim.

662
01:06:36,017 --> 01:06:40,512
Jack and Zack, my friends.
I cannot swim!

663
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:51,929
Arregg the dogs! Arregg the dogs!
Don't shoot me, please.

664
01:07:54,836 --> 01:07:58,328
Jack, my friend. Jack...

665
01:08:18,627 --> 01:08:21,118
He sleeps.

666
01:08:23,366 --> 01:08:25,698
Well,
I ain't going to sleep around here.

667
01:08:30,173 --> 01:08:33,007
This whole place
is crawling with alligators.

668
01:08:33,077 --> 01:08:36,410
Big ones.

669
01:08:36,481 --> 01:08:42,011
Snakes of all kinds.
You got water moccasins,

670
01:08:42,087 --> 01:08:47,582
copperheads, diamondbacks,
you name it, man.

671
01:08:47,659 --> 01:08:49,651
There's all kinds
of shit out there.

672
01:08:52,498 --> 01:08:57,334
I say we rest here for a while,
then we keep moving until daybreak.

673
01:09:02,408 --> 01:09:04,899
How big the alligators are?

674
01:09:07,180 --> 01:09:12,517
Uh, 12, maybe 15 feet long.

675
01:09:15,389 --> 01:09:18,381
Pretty near three times
your size, Bob.

676
01:09:27,903 --> 01:09:31,361
Red ants.

677
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:34,102
They can eat an entire family
in a half an hour.

678
01:09:37,780 --> 01:09:40,271
My family in half an hour?!

679
01:10:17,823 --> 01:10:19,814
What's wrong, Bob?

680
01:10:19,893 --> 01:10:23,226
I have lost my book of English.

681
01:10:23,296 --> 01:10:25,787
All I ever knowed is there.

682
01:10:25,865 --> 01:10:29,357
Come on, man.
You're lucky to even be here.

683
01:10:32,006 --> 01:10:35,498
I am lucky to even be here.

684
01:12:28,698 --> 01:12:31,030
Matches.

685
01:12:41,479 --> 01:12:43,639
Man, this looks a little too familiar.

686
01:12:48,486 --> 01:12:51,819
I gotta get away
from you guys.

687
01:12:51,889 --> 01:12:55,417
Yeah, that would be nice.

688
01:12:55,494 --> 01:12:58,588
The only problem is
we don't know where the hell we are.

689
01:13:03,603 --> 01:13:05,763
All right, look.

690
01:13:05,837 --> 01:13:07,771
I say we hole up here
for the night...

691
01:13:10,743 --> 01:13:12,677
and tomorrow
we leave in the boat.

692
01:13:12,745 --> 01:13:15,407
Hey, man, who the fuck
put you in charge?

693
01:13:15,481 --> 01:13:20,215
I put myself in charge,
because you can't keep it together.

694
01:13:20,287 --> 01:13:22,778
Aw, man.

695
01:13:24,324 --> 01:13:27,157
- The guy's a nut job.
- Fuck you.

696
01:13:27,227 --> 01:13:29,196
My job?

697
01:13:30,765 --> 01:13:34,701
I think we should go to Mississippi,
'cause that's the closest border.

698
01:13:34,769 --> 01:13:38,899
I, I, I would like
to go to west, to Texas.

699
01:13:38,973 --> 01:13:43,842
- No. No.
- A strange country I have seen
in many beautiful films.

700
01:13:43,912 --> 01:13:47,610
That's insane. If we go to Mississippi,
we get caught, we could get a retrial.

701
01:13:47,683 --> 01:13:49,617
If we go to Texas,
we get caught, we're fucked.

702
01:13:49,685 --> 01:13:51,619
Who told you that?

703
01:13:51,688 --> 01:13:54,554
My lawyer told me that
when I was gonna skip bond.

704
01:13:54,624 --> 01:13:56,955
Your lawyer... bunch of bullshit.

705
01:13:57,026 --> 01:14:01,020
Texas, ragazzi.
Very good in Texas.

706
01:14:01,097 --> 01:14:03,588
Cool, man. You go to Texas.
You go to Mars, for all I care.

707
01:14:03,667 --> 01:14:06,261
Just leave me alone, all right?

708
01:14:06,336 --> 01:14:12,172
Look, we're all staying together
till we find out where the hell we are.

709
01:14:12,243 --> 01:14:17,238
Right, Lieutenant.
Cool, cool. Yeah.

710
01:14:17,315 --> 01:14:19,647
Hey, would you mind?

711
01:14:19,717 --> 01:14:23,711
Scram.
Go, scram. Move.

712
01:14:36,836 --> 01:14:39,327
Zack, do you like Robert Frost?

713
01:14:41,808 --> 01:14:44,471
Not this again.

714
01:15:00,527 --> 01:15:04,965
A Road Less Traveled by Bob Frost.

715
01:15:05,033 --> 01:15:08,366
He was a very cynical man.

716
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:15,734
Robert Frost, in Italian?

717
01:15:15,811 --> 01:15:19,474
Yes. I have read only
your poets in Italian.

718
01:15:23,787 --> 01:15:25,778
Bob Frost.

719
01:15:32,296 --> 01:15:35,788
Bob Frost.

720
01:15:44,575 --> 01:15:46,736
In Italian.

721
01:17:05,263 --> 01:17:08,994
Be careful, Jack! Watch out the trees.

722
01:17:09,067 --> 01:17:11,729
The trees, a lot of trees.

723
01:17:11,804 --> 01:17:15,534
- Be careful.
- Come on, shift.

724
01:17:15,607 --> 01:17:19,772
- Come on, shift!
- Look out! Another trees.

725
01:17:23,549 --> 01:17:26,713
Dangerous.
Watch out, I cannot swim.

726
01:17:31,558 --> 01:17:35,255
Be careful!

727
01:17:57,453 --> 01:18:00,445
Well, which way now?

728
01:18:04,326 --> 01:18:06,318
Man, haven't we been here before?

729
01:18:09,332 --> 01:18:13,326
Seems like we passed
this fork hours ago.

730
01:18:13,403 --> 01:18:18,068
Man, it all looks the same to me.
I really can't tell.

731
01:18:18,142 --> 01:18:22,806
We've been goin' around in circles, Jack.

732
01:18:28,153 --> 01:18:33,022
Ragazzi! The boat! The boat!
The boat is finished.

733
01:18:33,091 --> 01:18:36,322
- There's water in the boat.
- Bail! Bail!

734
01:18:36,394 --> 01:18:38,920
- Go in the land! Go in the land!
- Move your leg.

735
01:18:38,998 --> 01:18:41,762
- No!
- Move your leg.

736
01:19:12,866 --> 01:19:15,530
Well, I don't know
which way to go now.

737
01:19:21,544 --> 01:19:24,877
- What do you think, Jack?
- How the fuck should I know?

738
01:19:29,553 --> 01:19:32,544
Yeah, well,
whatever you say, Jack.

739
01:20:00,318 --> 01:20:03,254
Hey, where is he?

740
01:20:03,322 --> 01:20:06,985
- What?
- Where's Bob?

741
01:20:07,059 --> 01:20:09,051
I don't know.

742
01:20:10,363 --> 01:20:13,025
He said something about food.

743
01:20:14,667 --> 01:20:17,500
- Maybe the alligators got him.
- Hey, man, don't say that.

744
01:20:21,008 --> 01:20:23,499
You know, we could
starve to death out here.

745
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:30,744
Aah, nah. This swamp can't
go on forever, man.

746
01:20:33,020 --> 01:20:36,013
- We'll find something.
- Man, he's leading us the wrong way.

747
01:20:41,696 --> 01:20:44,859
Who, Bob?

748
01:20:44,933 --> 01:20:47,095
He ain't leading us.

749
01:20:47,169 --> 01:20:50,502
Hey, man, you don't seem
to think I see what's going on.

750
01:20:50,573 --> 01:20:55,739
You're leadin' us around in circles.
I'm not blind to this. You're fuckin' us up.

751
01:20:55,812 --> 01:20:58,280
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

752
01:20:58,347 --> 01:21:02,512
That's right, man.
We're just gonna tire you out...

753
01:21:02,586 --> 01:21:04,746
then we're going to
move in for the kill.

754
01:21:04,821 --> 01:21:06,755
Then we're gonna have
Jack Romano for dinner.

755
01:21:06,824 --> 01:21:09,588
Yeah, is that right,
you fuckin' idiot?

756
01:21:09,661 --> 01:21:11,992
C'mon! C'mon.

757
01:21:13,131 --> 01:21:15,622
C'mon, man.

758
01:21:18,403 --> 01:21:22,238
Stop! Stop, my friends!
Stop the fight! Stop!

759
01:21:22,308 --> 01:21:25,175
My friends, stop! Stop.

760
01:21:25,244 --> 01:21:28,907
I have catched the rabbit... dinner.
For dinner.

761
01:21:28,981 --> 01:21:31,883
Huh?

762
01:21:31,950 --> 01:21:37,445
Fuck, man. I'm goin' off by myself.
I'm better off alone. Fuck.

763
01:21:37,524 --> 01:21:42,359
- S'all right with me, man.
- A rabbit. Very difficult to catch rabbit.

764
01:21:42,429 --> 01:21:46,058
- Every man for himself.
- Zack! Jack!

765
01:21:46,132 --> 01:21:50,968
I run half an hour for this rabbit...
very cunning rabbit.

766
01:22:00,482 --> 01:22:02,814
Well, it's 46 degrees.

767
01:22:06,054 --> 01:22:11,686
Slight breeze blowing
through some of our cypress trees...

768
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:16,424
that are blending in with
a lot of the smaller fir trees in the area.

769
01:22:19,902 --> 01:22:24,066
Vegetation, well, I'd say offhand...

770
01:22:24,140 --> 01:22:26,973
dates back to the Mesozoic period...

771
01:22:27,043 --> 01:22:32,710
the Tigris-Euphrates River Valley,
the cradle of civilization.

772
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:38,783
Guy's a fuckin' asshole, man.
Shit.

773
01:22:41,326 --> 01:22:44,488
I'm fuckin' starvin' to death.

774
01:22:44,561 --> 01:22:49,556
Man, my thing was cool, boy,
you know. I had my things goin', you know.

775
01:22:49,634 --> 01:22:55,231
My last walk out was like,
"Hey, L.C., how you doin', man?"

776
01:22:55,306 --> 01:23:00,472
Ohh... I'm sorry, baby. I didn't know
it was gonna be like that, man.

777
01:23:01,782 --> 01:23:05,512
Jack, Zack?
Zack, Jack?

778
01:23:05,584 --> 01:23:08,247
Jack?

779
01:23:08,321 --> 01:23:11,154
Why do you leave me alone?

780
01:23:11,224 --> 01:23:14,057
There is a very good...
very good rabbit.

781
01:23:14,127 --> 01:23:17,962
I know a very good way to cook it.

782
01:23:18,032 --> 01:23:22,560
My-My mother teached me.
My mother, Isolina.

783
01:23:22,638 --> 01:23:25,629
The name of my mother.
With rosemarino,

784
01:23:25,706 --> 01:23:28,676
rosemarino, olive oil, garlic...

785
01:23:28,744 --> 01:23:32,110
and other secrets of the Isolina.

786
01:23:35,350 --> 01:23:40,879
We're waiting right now for a check
on our general barometric pressure.

787
01:23:43,159 --> 01:23:47,152
Then it's back to more music
with the Lee Baby Simms Show.

788
01:23:54,004 --> 01:23:56,666
Didn't I tell that creep,
"She's not fuckin' available."

789
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:58,935
- Right?

790
01:23:59,009 --> 01:24:02,342
- Shut up!

791
01:24:03,714 --> 01:24:07,776
Before, she is very kind
with the rabbit.

792
01:24:07,853 --> 01:24:11,789
She call the rabbit,
"Good rabbit. I like this little rabbit.

793
01:24:11,857 --> 01:24:14,849
The eyes of the ra...Ta!

794
01:24:14,927 --> 01:24:18,226
Suddenly, the rabbit dead.

795
01:24:18,297 --> 01:24:22,960
Very strange mother, my mother.
Very strange, yes.

796
01:24:23,035 --> 01:24:27,871
My father, no. He's very strong,
but with the rabbit he is afraid.

797
01:24:27,940 --> 01:24:30,670
My sister... I have one mother
and three sisters.

798
01:24:30,743 --> 01:24:32,677
Bruna, Albertina, e Anna.

799
01:24:34,448 --> 01:24:38,350
I had a picture of my mother
in my room,

800
01:24:38,418 --> 01:24:43,913
smiling with the rabbit in her hand
and the other, so... Ha, ta.

801
01:24:45,193 --> 01:24:48,651
Sometime l-I dream
of my mother that call me,

802
01:24:48,730 --> 01:24:52,565
"Robertino, vieni qua.
Robertino, come on."

803
01:24:52,635 --> 01:24:55,364
"No, I don't want."
"Come on. Come on."

804
01:24:55,436 --> 01:24:59,874
Ta! Una bota in my neck.
"I am not rabbit." "Yes, you are."

805
01:25:01,577 --> 01:25:06,538
My mother...
very strange mother.

806
01:25:06,615 --> 01:25:09,278
But I love my mother.

807
01:25:09,352 --> 01:25:13,015
Isolina, and my father, Gigi,
and my sisters Bruna, Albertina, e Anna.

808
01:25:14,858 --> 01:25:18,191
My family and my rabbit.

809
01:25:18,261 --> 01:25:23,165
And I love to catch, to dream...

810
01:25:26,103 --> 01:25:28,594
- What is?

811
01:25:28,673 --> 01:25:32,667
What? Zack! Heh.
Jack! Jack and Zack!

812
01:25:32,744 --> 01:25:34,904
I knew! Come on. Come on.

813
01:25:34,979 --> 01:25:37,414
To eat the animal
I have catched.

814
01:25:37,482 --> 01:25:41,816
The rabbit. I run half an hour
behind it. Very good.

815
01:25:41,887 --> 01:25:45,288
Come on. Jack, come on.

816
01:25:45,357 --> 01:25:48,759
Sit down.
I am glad.

817
01:25:48,827 --> 01:25:52,320
Sit down, the fire.
Yes. Yes, taste it.

818
01:25:52,398 --> 01:25:56,062
Yes, taste it.
Taste, Zack, taste. Eh?

819
01:25:56,136 --> 01:26:00,368
Taste. In a moment.

820
01:26:00,441 --> 01:26:04,935
Yeah. Yeah.

821
01:26:05,012 --> 01:26:10,178
Yeah? Of course, I haven't
garlic, rosemarino...

822
01:26:10,251 --> 01:26:13,243
very important... and olive oil,
but is good, eh?

823
01:26:15,690 --> 01:26:17,681
- It's disgusting, Bob.
- Yes.

824
01:26:19,928 --> 01:26:23,921
- Bob, it tastes like a tire.
- Yeah. I know, is very good.

825
01:27:13,219 --> 01:27:15,550
The road.

826
01:27:23,697 --> 01:27:28,192
Civilization.

827
01:27:29,437 --> 01:27:33,601
Well, which way now, Jack?

828
01:27:42,416 --> 01:27:45,409
Well, I say we go that way.

829
01:27:45,487 --> 01:27:49,150
- I agree.
- Aye, aye, Lieutenant.

830
01:28:23,062 --> 01:28:28,397
It's a mirage.
You think we're imagining this?

831
01:28:28,467 --> 01:28:32,801
Well, if we are,
I could use some imaginary pie and coffee.

832
01:28:37,443 --> 01:28:40,935
One of us should go in there alone,
in case the law is inside.

833
01:28:45,952 --> 01:28:48,079
All right, Bob.

834
01:28:48,389 --> 01:28:53,349
I want you to go in there first.
Make sure everything's safe.

835
01:28:53,427 --> 01:28:57,761
If everything's all right,
you come back out and tell us.

836
01:28:57,832 --> 01:29:01,324
- You understand me?
- I understand. I "ham" ready.

837
01:29:01,402 --> 01:29:06,066
Okay. Hey, Bob,
we'll be right here.

838
01:29:06,140 --> 01:29:08,631
- Right here waiting.
- Yes.

839
01:29:34,305 --> 01:29:37,468
Jesus, he walked right in there
like an idiot.

840
01:29:40,377 --> 01:29:43,210
Let's hide over here.

841
01:30:08,375 --> 01:30:10,866
- Hey.

842
01:30:14,348 --> 01:30:16,839
How long was I asleep?

843
01:30:19,820 --> 01:30:22,813
Let's check it out,

844
01:30:22,891 --> 01:30:27,055
I'm starving to death
and I'm freezing, all right?

845
01:30:27,128 --> 01:30:30,859
All right.
Let's move slow.

846
01:30:30,932 --> 01:30:35,267
Just look in the window.
I'll be right behind you.

847
01:30:35,337 --> 01:30:37,999
Oh, thanks.

848
01:31:20,185 --> 01:31:23,849
Holy Toledo.
Can you believe this?

849
01:31:23,923 --> 01:31:26,414
He's from outer space.

850
01:31:54,923 --> 01:31:58,155
Oh! My friends!

851
01:31:58,227 --> 01:32:00,558
What the hell's goin' on here, Bob?

852
01:32:00,629 --> 01:32:02,563
Come on. Come on.
Is wonderful.

853
01:32:02,631 --> 01:32:07,967
Look, eh, wine, food.
Come on. Come on.

854
01:32:08,037 --> 01:32:10,699
Sit down, please.
Sit down here, Jack, Zack.

855
01:32:13,844 --> 01:32:18,110
Sit down. Sit down.
Is wonderful, look.

856
01:32:18,181 --> 01:32:23,346
My friends. I must tell us some news.

857
01:32:25,189 --> 01:32:28,590
I "ham" in love.
This is Nicoletta.

858
01:32:28,659 --> 01:32:31,059
- Hi. How you doing?
- Hello.

859
01:32:31,129 --> 01:32:34,587
- Fine, thank you.
- Eat, please.

860
01:32:34,666 --> 01:32:37,430
Thank you.

861
01:32:37,503 --> 01:32:40,563
Eat.

862
01:32:40,639 --> 01:32:45,975
- She is from Italy too.
- Yes, I'm from Italy.

863
01:32:46,046 --> 01:32:48,605
- Do you know, I am from Cesena?
- Cesena.

864
01:32:48,680 --> 01:32:50,842
- You know Cesena?
- No. No?

865
01:32:50,916 --> 01:32:55,752
And this place was given to me
as a present from my Uncle Luigi.

866
01:32:55,822 --> 01:32:59,121
- What happened to your Uncle Luigi?

867
01:32:59,192 --> 01:33:01,559
- He died.

868
01:33:01,629 --> 01:33:04,256
You laugh. He died.

869
01:33:04,330 --> 01:33:06,322
What was he like?

870
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:08,560
- He was wonderful. Yes.

871
01:33:08,636 --> 01:33:13,505
He won this place playing cards,
and he was afraid to lose it again,

872
01:33:13,575 --> 01:33:16,237
so he gave me like a present.

873
01:33:16,311 --> 01:33:19,939
But I didn't know
what to do with this.

874
01:33:20,014 --> 01:33:22,678
And one day...

875
01:33:22,752 --> 01:33:26,380
it was a very particular day...

876
01:33:26,455 --> 01:33:30,516
like out of the blue,
my boyfriend left me.

877
01:33:30,593 --> 01:33:33,426
- Aw.
- Yes. It was my birthday.

878
01:33:33,495 --> 01:33:34,987
- Aw.
- Yes.

879
01:33:35,064 --> 01:33:37,032
And Uncle Luigi died.

880
01:33:37,100 --> 01:33:39,034
- Oh, no.
- All in the same day.

881
01:33:39,102 --> 01:33:44,302
So in the same day, I left Italy
and I come to live here.

882
01:33:44,374 --> 01:33:49,209
Yes. Yes. Yes.

883
01:33:49,279 --> 01:33:52,113
And now I have falled
in love, at last.

884
01:33:54,285 --> 01:33:56,651
I have finded my new home.

885
01:33:56,720 --> 01:33:59,884
She has asked to me
if I stay here...

886
01:33:59,958 --> 01:34:03,417
to live together with her
forever and ever.

887
01:34:03,496 --> 01:34:06,487
- Like in a book for children.
- Yes.

888
01:34:06,564 --> 01:34:08,726
No.

889
01:34:16,243 --> 01:34:19,735
Well, how did you learn
how to speak English?

890
01:34:19,813 --> 01:34:22,213
Oh, yes. I speak pretty well,

891
01:34:22,282 --> 01:34:25,275
but I know nothing
about English for restaurant.

892
01:34:25,352 --> 01:34:28,550
Like food, good plate, nice dish...

893
01:34:28,623 --> 01:34:31,352
these word I don't know.

894
01:34:31,424 --> 01:34:34,916
Well, Bob should come in handy there.
He speaks good restaurant English.

895
01:34:34,996 --> 01:34:38,159
- Yes.
- Yes, my killer.

896
01:34:50,179 --> 01:34:53,012
Well, that's just great, Bob.

897
01:34:53,081 --> 01:34:56,415
Yeah, congratulations.
Do you know where we are?

898
01:34:56,486 --> 01:34:59,478
- Louisiana.
- No, I know Louisiana, but...

899
01:34:59,556 --> 01:35:03,014
Near the border ofTexas.

900
01:35:03,092 --> 01:35:07,086
Ah! You see?
Texas. I knew this, eh?

901
01:35:07,164 --> 01:35:12,158
Texas... near.
Remember?

902
01:35:12,235 --> 01:35:14,568
- Well, I propose a toast.
- Yes, thank you.

903
01:35:14,638 --> 01:35:18,200
- To Bob and Nicoletta.

904
01:35:18,276 --> 01:35:22,268
- Oh, my friends. Thank you.
- Thank you.

905
01:35:41,267 --> 01:35:45,261
Ah, you look good
in my Uncle Luigi clothes.

906
01:35:45,339 --> 01:35:47,830
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.

907
01:35:53,680 --> 01:35:56,844
Say, uh, you don't have a car
or anything, do you?

908
01:35:56,917 --> 01:36:01,251
Car, no. But I will save to buy one
and learn to drive.

909
01:36:01,321 --> 01:36:04,120
- I've only my bicycle.
- Ah.

910
01:36:04,192 --> 01:36:09,028
But there's a man who brings things
I need from town once a week or so.

911
01:36:15,237 --> 01:36:18,401
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

912
01:36:18,475 --> 01:36:21,466
- More Uncle Luigi clothes.
- Yes.

913
01:36:21,543 --> 01:36:24,034
Very sporty, Jack.

914
01:36:28,117 --> 01:36:31,110
So, but you are sure
you must leave today?

915
01:36:31,187 --> 01:36:36,853
Why we cannot stay here
for some times first?

916
01:36:36,926 --> 01:36:39,088
It's too dangerous out there, Bob.

917
01:36:39,163 --> 01:36:41,529
There's probably
an A.P.B. Out on all of us.

918
01:36:41,599 --> 01:36:44,762
Nah, I'm sure
we're gonna make it.

919
01:36:44,835 --> 01:36:49,169
Well, we're gonna
have to keep going.

920
01:36:51,176 --> 01:36:53,508
At least now we know where we are.

921
01:36:53,578 --> 01:36:55,739
And where do you go now?

922
01:36:55,815 --> 01:37:00,149
I'll probably head out west.
Out to Los Angeles.

923
01:37:02,655 --> 01:37:05,715
And you, my friend, Jack?
Where do you go?

924
01:37:05,792 --> 01:37:09,786
Well, if he's going to L.A.,
I'm gonna go east. You know what I mean?

925
01:37:09,863 --> 01:37:12,854
Yes, I know what I mean.

926
01:37:17,538 --> 01:37:20,531
Some music, yeah?

927
01:37:30,652 --> 01:37:36,591
Drip drop, drip drop
Drip drop, drip drop

928
01:37:36,659 --> 01:37:40,493
It's raining so hard

929
01:37:40,563 --> 01:37:44,090
Looks like it's gonna
rain all night

930
01:37:44,166 --> 01:37:50,106
And this is the time
I love for you to hold me tight

931
01:37:50,172 --> 01:37:53,540
But I guess
I'll have to accept

932
01:37:53,610 --> 01:37:57,239
The fact that
you are not here

933
01:37:57,314 --> 01:38:03,151
I wish tonight would hurry up
and end, my dear

934
01:38:03,221 --> 01:38:07,555
You're sure
you must leave today? I stay.

935
01:38:16,768 --> 01:38:23,402
This is the time I love
to be holding you tight

936
01:38:23,475 --> 01:38:29,812
I guess I'll just
go crazy at night

937
01:38:29,882 --> 01:38:33,182
- It's raining so hard
- Drip drop, drip drop

938
01:38:33,253 --> 01:38:37,315
- Drip that never ends
- Drip drop, drip drop

939
01:38:37,391 --> 01:38:42,886
All of the time
that you were here with me

940
01:38:42,963 --> 01:38:49,129
Counting every drop
About to blow my top

941
01:38:49,203 --> 01:38:55,870
I wish this rain
would hurry up and stop

942
01:38:55,943 --> 01:39:02,076
I've got the blues so bad
I can hardly catch my breath

943
01:39:02,150 --> 01:39:08,521
The harder it rains
the worse it gets

944
01:39:08,591 --> 01:39:14,929
This is the time I love
to be holding you tight

945
01:39:14,997 --> 01:39:20,163
I guess I'll just
go crazy at night

946
01:39:20,237 --> 01:39:26,836
Drip drop, drip drop
Drip drop, drip drop

947
01:39:26,910 --> 01:39:31,108
- Drip drop

948
01:39:31,181 --> 01:39:33,844
If you follow this road,

949
01:39:33,918 --> 01:39:36,978
you will come to a place
where it becomes two roads.

950
01:39:38,456 --> 01:39:43,588
On the right will go east.
On the left will go west.

951
01:39:43,661 --> 01:39:48,827
Eh, no.
On the right will go west.

952
01:39:48,901 --> 01:39:54,033
Eh, no. I'm not sure.
Anyway there is a sign to tell you.

953
01:39:54,107 --> 01:39:57,304
- It's all right. We'll figure it out.
- It's okay?

954
01:39:57,377 --> 01:40:00,710
- Thanks for everything.
- Yeah. Thank you. Good-bye.

955
01:40:00,780 --> 01:40:04,877
- Good-bye. And take care.
- Zack.

956
01:40:04,951 --> 01:40:07,283
- Okay, Bob.
- I will.

957
01:40:07,354 --> 01:40:09,755
- Good-bye, Bob.
- Jack.

958
01:40:14,595 --> 01:40:18,259
- Be careful.
- Okay.

959
01:40:30,246 --> 01:40:35,548
- Don't forget to write.
- Bye.

960
01:40:35,618 --> 01:40:37,950
So long.

961
01:40:44,794 --> 01:40:47,285
Wish you were here.

962
01:41:48,130 --> 01:41:52,123
- I guess this is it.
- Yeah.

963
01:41:52,201 --> 01:41:54,692
I don't see a sign
around or anything.

964
01:41:54,770 --> 01:41:58,103
Well, she said the one
to the right goes west.

965
01:41:58,174 --> 01:42:00,108
She said she didn't know.

966
01:42:00,176 --> 01:42:02,110
Look, man, don't matter to me.

967
01:42:02,178 --> 01:42:05,841
You go whichever way you want, right?
And I'll go the other way.

968
01:42:05,915 --> 01:42:08,577
- Yeah, right. All right.
- All right?

969
01:42:14,191 --> 01:42:16,352
So, uh...

970
01:42:17,862 --> 01:42:20,695
this is how you dressed
before you were in the joint, right?

971
01:42:20,765 --> 01:42:23,599
Sort of garbage man on parade.

972
01:42:26,938 --> 01:42:30,601
You, uh, plannin' on doin'
a little squirrel huntin', Jack?

973
01:42:34,846 --> 01:42:37,008
Yeah.

974
01:42:52,733 --> 01:42:55,224
Okay.

975
01:43:00,607 --> 01:43:03,269
Well...

976
01:43:05,513 --> 01:43:09,176
Good luck with yourself... Zack.

977
01:44:14,053 --> 01:44:17,046
Well, ya play that Tarantella

978
01:44:17,123 --> 01:44:19,523
All the hounds will start to roar

979
01:44:19,592 --> 01:44:24,394
The boys all go to hell
and then the Cubans hit the floor

980
01:44:24,465 --> 01:44:29,334
They drive along the pipeline
They tango till they're sore

981
01:44:29,404 --> 01:44:33,568
They take apart their nightmares
and they leave 'em by the door

982
01:44:33,642 --> 01:44:39,444
Let me fall out of the window
with confetti in my hair

983
01:44:39,514 --> 01:44:43,917
Deal outjacks or better
on a blanket by the stairs

984
01:44:43,986 --> 01:44:48,753
I'll tell you all my secrets
but I lie about my past

985
01:44:48,825 --> 01:44:52,159
And send me off
to bed forevermore

986
01:44:55,899 --> 01:44:58,424
Make sure they play
my theme song

987
01:44:58,501 --> 01:45:00,902
I guess daisies
will have to do

988
01:45:00,971 --> 01:45:05,636
Just get me to New Orleans
and paint shadows on the pews

989
01:45:05,710 --> 01:45:09,771
Turn the spit on that pig
and kick the drum and let me down

990
01:45:09,848 --> 01:45:14,945
Put my clarinet beneath your bed
till I get back in town

991
01:45:15,019 --> 01:45:20,184
Let me fall out of the window
with confetti in my hair

992
01:45:20,258 --> 01:45:25,025
Deal outjacks or better

but I lie about my past

994
01:45:29,936 --> 01:45:33,337
So send me off
to bed forevermore

995
01:45:36,910 --> 01:45:41,745
Just make sure she's all in calico
and the color of a doll

996
01:45:41,815 --> 01:45:46,753
Wave the flag on Cadillac day
and a skillet on the wall

997
01:45:46,821 --> 01:45:51,383
Cut me a switch or hold your breath
till the sun goes down

998
01:45:51,459 --> 01:45:56,453
Write my name on the hood
Send me off to another town

999
01:45:56,530 --> 01:46:01,161
Andjust let me fall out of the window
with confetti in my hair

1003
01:46:20,823 --> 01:46:25,693
Fall out of the window
with confetti in my hair

1004
01:46:25,762 --> 01:46:30,462
Deal outjacks or better
