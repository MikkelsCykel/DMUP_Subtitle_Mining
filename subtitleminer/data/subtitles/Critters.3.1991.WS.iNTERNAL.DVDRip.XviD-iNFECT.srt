1
00:02:01,352 --> 00:02:02,399
What?

2
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,839
- All the cops have wooden legs!
- They sure do!

3
00:02:16,712 --> 00:02:19,013
- All right, hold on!
- What is it?!

4
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:21,218
Flat tire! Hold on!

5
00:02:23,655 --> 00:02:25,510
Oh, man.

6
00:02:27,688 --> 00:02:29,989
All right, I'm gonna find
a place to pull over.

7
00:03:05,607 --> 00:03:07,298
Oh, man.

8
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:10,054
Excuse me.

9
00:03:11,207 --> 00:03:13,378
Hey, I like this place.

10
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,935
Maybe we could build
some houses,

11
00:03:16,007 --> 00:03:17,698
just like
"Gilligan's Island."

12
00:03:18,887 --> 00:03:20,742
"Gilligan's Island"?

13
00:03:20,807 --> 00:03:23,295
After all
that's happened, Annie,

14
00:03:23,368 --> 00:03:24,993
what's wrong
with going home?

15
00:03:25,063 --> 00:03:27,320
Dad...

16
00:03:26,567 --> 00:03:29,534
- vacation was fine.
- Yeah, fine.

17
00:03:29,607 --> 00:03:31,941
Let's face it, Annie,

18
00:03:32,008 --> 00:03:34,309
it's just not the way
that it was.

19
00:03:35,367 --> 00:03:37,800
Dad, Mom's been dead
for two years.

20
00:03:37,512 --> 00:03:39,617
It's the way it is.

21
00:03:41,127 --> 00:03:42,654
We have lift-off.

22
00:03:46,631 --> 00:03:49,598
Honey, look, why don't you
just hit the cooler,

23
00:03:49,671 --> 00:03:51,711
get yourself some pop?
But stay close,

24
00:03:51,783 --> 00:03:53,376
'cause I want to fix
this tire

25
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,552
and get on home.

26
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:16,831
Hey, don't go
down there, kid.

27
00:04:16,903 --> 00:04:18,910
There's all kinds
of wild animals and shit.

28
00:04:18,983 --> 00:04:21,122
- Who do you belong to?
- Who do you belong to?

29
00:04:28,967 --> 00:04:32,033
Hey! Hey, you!
Hands off!

30
00:04:32,103 --> 00:04:34,918
Are you some kind
of a pervert or something?

31
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:37,122
Johnny, you know better.
You don't even know this guy.

32
00:04:37,192 --> 00:04:39,613
I don't know you either, okay?

33
00:04:39,687 --> 00:04:41,629
He almost
went over the edge.

34
00:04:41,703 --> 00:04:44,930
There could be badgers
or something down there.

35
00:04:46,247 --> 00:04:48,003
Throw it.

36
00:04:50,632 --> 00:04:51,941
Come on, throw it.

37
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,760
Well, throw it.

38
00:04:56,551 --> 00:04:58,690
Go back, come on.

39
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:21,550
Wow, bald and flat.

40
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,334
I feel for you, man.

41
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:28,293
Sometimes life really sucks,
doesn't it?

42
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:54,623
Looks like you just bought me
a tournament Frisbee, dude.

43
00:05:57,095 --> 00:05:58,589
I can get it back.
No sweat.

44
00:06:18,535 --> 00:06:21,056
Come on. What, are you guys
standing guard? Let's go.

45
00:06:22,503 --> 00:06:24,739
Come on, guys, let's go
the other way, okay?

46
00:06:36,647 --> 00:06:38,305
Johnny, come on.

47
00:06:56,392 --> 00:06:57,918
Ah, ha!

48
00:06:57,991 --> 00:06:59,518
I told you.

49
00:07:04,072 --> 00:07:05,926
Was I right,
or was I right?

50
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:28,958
No playing here!

51
00:07:30,055 --> 00:07:31,582
You kids oughta
know better than...

52
00:07:32,615 --> 00:07:34,176
wait.

53
00:07:35,911 --> 00:07:37,372
You hear it?

54
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,781
It could be anywhere
around here.

55
00:07:39,847 --> 00:07:43,360
Above us, behind us,

56
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:45,537
or in the ground.

57
00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:55,330
Do you think this is
some kind of joke?

58
00:07:54,567 --> 00:07:57,022
You think this is
some kind of game?!

59
00:07:58,727 --> 00:08:01,597
They're hungry.
All they do is eat.

60
00:08:02,887 --> 00:08:05,669
You got to keep a weathered
eye out all the time!

61
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:08,637
If you don't watch
every minute... then wham!

62
00:08:09,895 --> 00:08:12,230
Then it's too late.

63
00:08:16,967 --> 00:08:19,010
Who are you?

64
00:08:20,807 --> 00:08:23,774
Any of you ever hear
of a place called Grover's Bend?

65
00:08:25,511 --> 00:08:27,650
It's a real town
with real people.

66
00:08:27,719 --> 00:08:30,501
Now, in 1984...

67
00:08:31,687 --> 00:08:33,541
I was riding my bicycle

68
00:08:33,607 --> 00:08:35,679
and I looked up.

69
00:08:35,751 --> 00:08:38,501
I saw this thing
in the sky.

70
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:50,845
Call the Army.
They're here!

71
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:53,533
- Who?
- Who?!

72
00:08:53,607 --> 00:08:55,974
Them!

73
00:09:05,383 --> 00:09:08,166
On Earth I was just
a big nobody.

74
00:09:08,231 --> 00:09:10,303
Up in space I am
somebody.

75
00:09:17,511 --> 00:09:19,878
Charlie bounty hunter.

76
00:09:19,943 --> 00:09:22,725
Yeah, "Charlie
bounty hunter."

77
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,065
Dad's all torn up
and Mom's got

78
00:09:32,135 --> 00:09:34,502
a harpoon thing in her neck,
and they're getting bigger.

79
00:09:38,663 --> 00:09:40,518
You're not
from around here, are you?

80
00:09:46,663 --> 00:09:49,052
I got to go where
the cosmic winds blow me.

81
00:09:51,911 --> 00:09:53,537
I got to...

82
00:09:53,607 --> 00:09:57,501
go where no man
has gone before.

83
00:09:59,367 --> 00:10:01,254
I'm a bounty hunter!

84
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:12,803
Come on, you can't expect us
to believe this horseshit.

85
00:10:13,927 --> 00:10:15,683
You can believe
what you want, son.

86
00:10:15,751 --> 00:10:19,297
All I know is you got to get away
from here while you still can.

87
00:10:19,367 --> 00:10:22,120
Well, there's something
I can agree with.

88
00:10:21,543 --> 00:10:24,520
So walk away.

89
00:10:36,103 --> 00:10:37,532
There you go.

90
00:10:38,983 --> 00:10:42,710
Probably could've used that lug
wrench a little while longer.

91
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:46,100
Got it.

92
00:10:45,543 --> 00:10:47,550
You should have had
your spare tire down here.

93
00:10:47,623 --> 00:10:49,630
Could've saved you
some traveling.

94
00:10:49,703 --> 00:10:54,180
Never know when you'll have
a flat tire on an antique like this.

95
00:10:54,823 --> 00:10:57,158
Are you supposed
to be scary?

96
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:58,750
Me?

97
00:10:58,822 --> 00:11:00,317
No.

98
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:03,041
It ain't me,
it's them.

99
00:11:03,111 --> 00:11:05,283
I've seen them.

100
00:11:05,351 --> 00:11:07,074
I've been
seeing them for...

101
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:10,852
Look, you believe
in monsters?

102
00:11:13,063 --> 00:11:16,195
- Yeah.
- Good. Good.

103
00:11:16,263 --> 00:11:18,652
That's what
I'm telling you about.

104
00:11:18,726 --> 00:11:20,831
Now, some friends
of mine from...

105
00:11:20,902 --> 00:11:22,690
a long way off,

106
00:11:22,503 --> 00:11:24,194
they gave me
a whole bunch of these.

107
00:11:24,263 --> 00:11:26,118
I only got
a couple left,

108
00:11:26,183 --> 00:11:29,250
but I want you
to have one.

109
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:33,701
Now if this ever starts
to glow bright green,

110
00:11:33,767 --> 00:11:35,807
that's the time
to watch out for yourself.

111
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:37,734
And your family.

112
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:40,832
- Green.
- That's right, green.

113
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:45,697
Annie! Johnny!

114
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:50,100
- All aboard!
- We really have to go now.

115
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:52,545
- Give my regards to Mars.
- Don't be so quick.

116
00:11:52,615 --> 00:11:54,306
You're not as smart
as you think you are.

117
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:58,046
You can have the rest
of my root beer.

118
00:11:58,119 --> 00:12:01,260
Thank you, partner.
It's my favorite.

119
00:12:00,551 --> 00:12:02,045
Johnny, come on now.

120
00:12:12,038 --> 00:12:13,893
Look what I found.

121
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:15,333
What is it?

122
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:17,504
I don't know. It looks
like a big electric bullet.

123
00:12:17,575 --> 00:12:19,168
Homemade.
He dropped it.

124
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:22,054
Joshua!
Front and center, now.

125
00:12:24,199 --> 00:12:26,533
- Joshua?
- Josh, please.

126
00:12:26,599 --> 00:12:29,598
- Is that your father?
- Stepfather.

127
00:12:31,175 --> 00:12:34,209
Never, never will we trust you
out of our sight again.

128
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:36,384
When I say five minutes,

129
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:39,324
I don't mean seven,
I don't mean three.

130
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:41,733
Discipline from now on,
young man. Hmm?

131
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:45,824
I will not
and your mother will not...

132
00:12:47,814 --> 00:12:49,887
spare anymore rods.

133
00:12:53,991 --> 00:12:57,024
Is he going
to get spanked?

134
00:12:57,095 --> 00:12:59,690
I don't think his mom
is going to let that happen.

135
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:04,880
Well, Big John, I guess
we had some adventure, huh?!

136
00:13:06,854 --> 00:13:08,098
Dad!

137
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:09,857
Dad, you should
have seen it!

138
00:13:09,927 --> 00:13:13,026
- There was this strange guy...
- I really don't care.

139
00:13:13,095 --> 00:13:15,615
I told you two to stay close,
didn't I?

140
00:13:15,687 --> 00:13:18,076
Look at the two of you...
you're filthy.

141
00:13:18,151 --> 00:13:20,387
- Johnny, get in the truck.
- I know, Dad,

142
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,269
but he came out of the ground
and scared the crap out of us.

143
00:13:23,334 --> 00:13:25,342
He scared the crap
out of us.

144
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:27,845
Miss Sawyer...

145
00:13:27,911 --> 00:13:30,878
can we please watch
our language around Johnny?

146
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:38,652
Shit.

147
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:46,530
Look, honey, I just don't know
what to say to you.

148
00:13:48,071 --> 00:13:51,940
You could say that you're not
going on the road tomorrow.

149
00:13:51,526 --> 00:13:54,014
You could say that I'm not
old enough to take care of myself.

150
00:13:54,087 --> 00:13:55,549
Honey, you're not
being fair.

151
00:13:55,622 --> 00:13:58,688
Mr. and Mrs. Menges take
real good care of you guys.

152
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:00,890
They're like family.
Hey...

153
00:14:01,991 --> 00:14:03,845
it's the best
that I can do.

154
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,601
Besides, you're
a young woman now.

155
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:09,179
Maybe I don't want
to be a young woman now.

156
00:14:28,966 --> 00:14:30,722
Grover's Bend?

157
00:14:34,247 --> 00:14:35,774
What a crock.

158
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:48,742
You're listening
to Topeka's

159
00:14:48,807 --> 00:14:52,898
number one country radio station...
Country 107, KTPK.

160
00:14:56,966 --> 00:14:58,559
Hey, Frank,

161
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:01,380
give me a hand with some
of this stuff, man.

162
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:04,097
Absolutely, Mario.

163
00:15:05,286 --> 00:15:08,253
I am the handyman
after all.

164
00:15:11,046 --> 00:15:13,697
- You asshole.
- I heard that.

165
00:15:33,382 --> 00:15:35,870
Vaya con Dios, Mario.

166
00:15:35,943 --> 00:15:38,758
Four more units
to vacate, Jessie,

167
00:15:38,823 --> 00:15:40,994
and I'm a rich man.

168
00:15:45,223 --> 00:15:47,743
Hey, you got
the elevator fixed.

169
00:15:51,622 --> 00:15:53,084
Frankie.

170
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:55,068
Hey, not for you, Rosie.

171
00:15:55,143 --> 00:15:58,170
There's still
a one-ton load limit.

172
00:15:58,823 --> 00:16:00,067
Ooh, you...

173
00:16:09,062 --> 00:16:12,194
Yo, yo, yo.
Check your weapons at the door,

174
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:14,913
it's the chick
that walks like a man.

175
00:16:16,263 --> 00:16:18,848
Dating outside
our species now, huh?

176
00:16:18,918 --> 00:16:20,926
Oh, very funny.

177
00:16:20,999 --> 00:16:22,689
Very, very funny.

178
00:16:22,758 --> 00:16:24,384
I wasn't talking
to you, Frank.

179
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,700
Yo, Marcia,

180
00:16:26,502 --> 00:16:28,869
I got a little
phone problem.

181
00:16:28,935 --> 00:16:32,164
Maybe you can come down to the
basement and check my equipment?

182
00:16:32,231 --> 00:16:36,355
Sorry, Frank,
I left my microscope upstairs.

183
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,211
Ho-ho! Ho!

184
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:41,024
She's killing me.

185
00:16:41,094 --> 00:16:43,134
Hey, Mario.

186
00:16:43,206 --> 00:16:45,500
I sure am sorry to see
you go, my friend.

187
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:48,860
I just killed two rats
this morning.

188
00:16:48,518 --> 00:16:50,340
Rats?!

189
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,828
Hey, Frank... rats.

190
00:16:52,903 --> 00:16:54,659
Hey, don't look at me.

191
00:16:54,726 --> 00:16:58,109
I got to see them
to "e-rat-icate" them.

192
00:16:59,782 --> 00:17:02,564
Yo, Jessie,
look who's home.

193
00:17:03,719 --> 00:17:04,897
Something's wrong.

194
00:17:04,967 --> 00:17:06,789
No brakes!

195
00:17:06,854 --> 00:17:09,953
No brakes!
Hold onto Johnny.

196
00:17:17,255 --> 00:17:18,815
Everybody all right?

197
00:17:18,886 --> 00:17:19,966
Yeah.

198
00:17:21,574 --> 00:17:23,167
Safe at home.

199
00:17:30,662 --> 00:17:32,386
Oh, man.

200
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:35,716
I'm sorry, Mario.
No brakes.

201
00:17:35,783 --> 00:17:37,343
Something I can do?

202
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:39,935
That's okay.

203
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,301
Is everybody okay?

204
00:17:46,726 --> 00:17:49,220
So, Frank,

205
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,623
you going to give us
a hand with this?

206
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:52,069
No.

207
00:17:52,134 --> 00:17:53,956
I'm the maintenance man.

208
00:17:54,023 --> 00:17:55,713
He doesn't live here
anymore.

209
00:17:56,774 --> 00:17:58,563
Love you, Jessie.

210
00:17:59,654 --> 00:18:01,661
I'll be in my office.

211
00:18:01,734 --> 00:18:04,833
Listen, would you
clean up this junk?

212
00:18:06,374 --> 00:18:08,065
The guy's a waste
of protein.

213
00:18:08,135 --> 00:18:10,109
Yeah, but what
a snappy dresser.

214
00:18:10,182 --> 00:18:12,735
Dad, I'm gonna go say hello
to the Menges.

215
00:18:12,806 --> 00:18:15,075
Yeah, but don't go up
empty handed.

216
00:18:15,143 --> 00:18:16,866
You take something with,
all right?

217
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:29,317
Ladies.

218
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,921
Java.

219
00:18:47,591 --> 00:18:49,281
Fuck. Wh...?

220
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,605
What's this?

221
00:18:56,294 --> 00:18:58,977
Oh, that's disgusting.

222
00:19:17,511 --> 00:19:19,999
Yeah, you're next, pal.

223
00:19:23,271 --> 00:19:25,125
Hey, girl.

224
00:19:25,191 --> 00:19:27,046
Going down to help Dad?

225
00:19:27,111 --> 00:19:28,801
I thought I might.

226
00:19:28,871 --> 00:19:30,878
I mean, we got ourselves
a loaded truck,

227
00:19:30,951 --> 00:19:32,642
an unloaded camper,
a car wreck...

228
00:19:32,711 --> 00:19:34,980
- I think they can use my help.
- Marcia?

229
00:19:35,046 --> 00:19:38,242
Are there any jobs down
at the phone company?

230
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,601
What, you need a job?

231
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:45,810
Ah, you want
Clifford home.

232
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:47,965
Well, I was just thinking.

233
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:51,041
We'll see what we can do.

234
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:54,722
Yeah, we will.

235
00:20:03,591 --> 00:20:07,169
- Hello! Hello, Annie.
- Hello.

236
00:20:07,238 --> 00:20:09,693
Welcome home, dear.
Come in.

237
00:20:09,766 --> 00:20:12,319
Did you have
a wonderful trip?

238
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:16,890
Dear, say hello to Annie. They've
just been to the Grand Canyon.

239
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:20,861
Say, did you know they just
discovered an alien graveyard there?

240
00:20:20,934 --> 00:20:24,065
- Who did?
- Government.

241
00:20:24,134 --> 00:20:25,661
Secret.

242
00:20:25,734 --> 00:20:29,378
Wait till you taste
what I'm cooking today.

243
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:32,065
Where's Johnny?
He'll love them.

244
00:20:32,135 --> 00:20:34,175
Tell me about
your trip, dear.

245
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:38,181
Oh, yeah. Well, we froze
to death in Arizona,

246
00:20:38,247 --> 00:20:40,964
saw these Indian caves
in Mesa Verde,

247
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:43,616
and met this weird lunatic
near Grover's Bend.

248
00:20:43,686 --> 00:20:45,508
He jumped right out
from the ground.

249
00:20:45,575 --> 00:20:47,615
So you had a good time?

250
00:20:47,686 --> 00:20:49,213
Grover's Bend?

251
00:20:49,286 --> 00:20:52,548
I'm making Mr. Menges'
favorite dish today.

252
00:20:52,614 --> 00:20:54,556
Ham and beans.

253
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:57,183
Will you and Johnny
stay for dinner?

254
00:20:58,822 --> 00:21:01,789
No. It's our last night
together with Dad.

255
00:21:01,862 --> 00:21:03,935
He leaves on the 8:15
to Chicago.

256
00:21:04,006 --> 00:21:06,014
We better save
the tarts till later.

257
00:21:07,303 --> 00:21:10,150
I don't want your father to say
I spoiled your dinner...

258
00:21:10,214 --> 00:21:12,036
again.

259
00:21:16,582 --> 00:21:18,273
Hello, girls.

260
00:21:18,342 --> 00:21:20,033
How you doing, eh?

261
00:21:21,286 --> 00:21:23,075
Are you a little hungry?

262
00:21:23,142 --> 00:21:26,972
How about I give you to
the old farts upstairs tonight?

263
00:21:33,062 --> 00:21:35,070
Iris Arms apartment complex,

264
00:21:35,143 --> 00:21:38,170
Frank Longo
at your service.

265
00:21:37,542 --> 00:21:39,233
Longo, what's
the good news?

266
00:21:39,302 --> 00:21:41,790
Yo, right here.
Right here, Mr. Briggs.

267
00:21:41,863 --> 00:21:44,350
I hope you did
what I'm paying you for.

268
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,113
Yes. Yes, I did.

269
00:21:46,182 --> 00:21:47,709
Yes, I did.

270
00:21:47,782 --> 00:21:50,629
Mario is history
as of right now.

271
00:21:50,694 --> 00:21:53,280
You promised me
all of them.

272
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:55,838
- I lose my investors...
- Hey.

273
00:21:55,911 --> 00:21:57,634
The way I look at this,

274
00:21:57,702 --> 00:21:59,229
is that you are making

275
00:21:59,302 --> 00:22:02,084
all the "el giganto" profits
off the sale of this shithole,

276
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:03,394
not little old moi.

277
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,731
- You listen to me, Frank.
- Well...

278
00:22:05,798 --> 00:22:09,094
maybe it's time that you get
down here and get involved.

279
00:22:09,158 --> 00:22:11,394
I hired you so I wouldn't
have to get involved.

280
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:15,172
I'm not lifting another finger
until you pay me for Mario!

281
00:22:15,238 --> 00:22:18,053
You got that?!
You can take that to the bank!

282
00:22:19,238 --> 00:22:20,765
Balls!

283
00:22:29,638 --> 00:22:31,165
Hello?

284
00:22:35,718 --> 00:22:37,245
Hello?

285
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,226
Where are you?

286
00:22:46,118 --> 00:22:47,809
What are you doing out

287
00:22:47,878 --> 00:22:50,693
without Uncle Frankie's
permission, huh?

288
00:22:52,646 --> 00:22:55,995
Go back upstairs
where you belong!

289
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:59,649
Work with me!

290
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:12,862
What this dump needs
is a good four alarm fire.

291
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:19,203
- Dad, dinner's getting cold.
- Coming.

292
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:22,629
I want you to listen
to the Menges.

293
00:23:22,694 --> 00:23:24,833
Sometimes I think
you don't listen.

294
00:23:24,902 --> 00:23:27,323
I'll be back
Friday night.

295
00:23:27,398 --> 00:23:29,700
- Oh, toothpaste.
- Got it.

296
00:23:29,766 --> 00:23:32,614
You really should pack
some vitamins, too.

297
00:23:32,678 --> 00:23:35,296
And I want you to help her
make beds in the mornings.

298
00:23:35,366 --> 00:23:37,188
She's not a young woman,
you know.

299
00:23:38,534 --> 00:23:40,672
- I'm done.
- Can't you wait for Dad?

300
00:23:40,742 --> 00:23:43,557
Mr. M promised me
pirate stories.

301
00:23:48,006 --> 00:23:49,828
- Bye.
- Bye.

302
00:23:49,894 --> 00:23:51,749
- You be a good boy.
- Okay.

303
00:23:51,815 --> 00:23:53,822
- See ya.
- See ya.

304
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:01,125
- Dad.
- Hmm?

305
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:04,317
What's going to happen
to the Menges?

306
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:06,081
I mean, where will
they go?

307
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:11,837
We're going to have
to move too, you know.

308
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:13,503
They'll get us out.

309
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:19,998
Dad, you're going to have
to deal with this.

310
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:22,787
You got to think about it,
make some decisions.

311
00:24:22,854 --> 00:24:25,190
Annie...

312
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:26,274
I'm going
to eat my dinner,

313
00:24:26,342 --> 00:24:29,124
and then I'm going to watch
some moronic situation comedy,

314
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:31,197
and then I'm going to sleep
the sleep of the dead.

315
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,677
Can we worry
about this tomorrow?

316
00:25:10,246 --> 00:25:12,570
I love my work.

317
00:25:57,702 --> 00:25:59,196
Ow, ow, ow!

318
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:00,830
Hot! Hot!

319
00:26:02,502 --> 00:26:04,509
Damn teenagers!

320
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:11,964
Wh...?

321
00:26:53,894 --> 00:26:56,349
Oh! Oh, oh...

322
00:26:59,558 --> 00:27:01,118
Hairballs.

323
00:27:05,798 --> 00:27:07,358
Did you hear something?

324
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,568
No.

325
00:27:09,638 --> 00:27:11,972
Tell Johnny bedtime,
one hour.

326
00:27:12,038 --> 00:27:14,078
That goes for you, too.

327
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:16,833
Oh, and give this check
to Mrs. Menges.

328
00:27:16,902 --> 00:27:18,724
It's for taking care
of you guys.

329
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:21,757
Tell her I'll cover
the rest of it when I get back.

330
00:27:23,078 --> 00:27:25,085
Dad, remember how much fun
we used to have?

331
00:27:28,998 --> 00:27:30,688
Yeah.

332
00:27:31,878 --> 00:27:33,568
What was I like then?

333
00:27:33,638 --> 00:27:34,848
Shorter.

334
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:48,925
Dad...

335
00:27:48,998 --> 00:27:50,623
maybe I could
go get Johnny

336
00:27:50,694 --> 00:27:52,549
and we could play a game
or something.

337
00:27:52,614 --> 00:27:55,680
Honey, give me your
battery-powered TV, would you?

338
00:28:17,094 --> 00:28:18,850
Oh God.

339
00:28:27,974 --> 00:28:30,145
- Who's there?
- It's just me.

340
00:28:30,214 --> 00:28:31,905
Laundry night.

341
00:28:31,974 --> 00:28:34,079
I'm a little spooked
tonight, too.

342
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:36,703
Did you hear
screaming before?

343
00:28:36,774 --> 00:28:38,720
It was probably
just Frank.

344
00:28:39,814 --> 00:28:42,149
- What is eating him?
- I don't know.

345
00:28:42,214 --> 00:28:44,580
Frank's just naturally
repulsive.

346
00:28:46,534 --> 00:28:49,982
Say hello to Mrs.
and Mr. Menges for me.

347
00:28:50,054 --> 00:28:51,810
Right.

348
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:23,873
Aaah!

349
00:29:38,054 --> 00:29:39,744
Frank?

350
00:29:40,934 --> 00:29:43,355
I know you're there.
I can hear you breathing.

351
00:29:44,709 --> 00:29:46,913
Talk to me, Frank.

352
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:50,335
Frank?

353
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,510
Frank? Hello?

354
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:58,565
All right, Longo, very funny.
Enough is enough.

355
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,157
Frank?

356
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:02,564
We are not amused.

357
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:05,761
Try to guess just how close
your termination is.

358
00:30:08,166 --> 00:30:10,600
Okay, it's your funeral,
wiseass.

359
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:12,957
I'm coming over there and
taking care of things myself.

360
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:22,849
We got another errand to do
before we sleep, sport.

361
00:30:22,918 --> 00:30:24,511
Business.

362
00:30:25,542 --> 00:30:27,364
Can't you just
drop me off at home?

363
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,601
No way, sport.

364
00:30:29,669 --> 00:30:32,004
Someday this pool
will be yours.

365
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:34,753
You're going to have
to learn how to swim in it.

366
00:30:38,118 --> 00:30:41,740
Looks like they'll have to meet
their landlord after all.

367
00:30:45,254 --> 00:30:50,338
See?
Grover's Bend, 1986.

368
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,722
Now, you can see the same kind
of occurrence two years later...

369
00:30:53,798 --> 00:30:55,358
1988.

370
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,285
Even local law enforcement

371
00:30:57,350 --> 00:31:01,060
claims they've seen
space aliens.

372
00:31:01,126 --> 00:31:04,093
One of them supposedly killed
a sheriff in the '88 encounter.

373
00:31:04,166 --> 00:31:05,693
A sheriff?

374
00:31:05,766 --> 00:31:08,765
Yes.
A sheriff wearing...

375
00:31:08,838 --> 00:31:11,360
an Easter Bunny suit.

376
00:31:10,566 --> 00:31:15,617
And I'll bet the aliens
were all wearing tuxedos.

377
00:31:15,686 --> 00:31:20,010
Of course, he must have been reading
the same newspapers as you.

378
00:31:19,526 --> 00:31:21,860
That's where he got the story
in the first place.

379
00:31:21,926 --> 00:31:23,354
Who? What guy?

380
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:26,690
That crazy guy
we ran into on vacation.

381
00:31:26,502 --> 00:31:28,804
He actually believes
this stuff.

382
00:31:31,686 --> 00:31:34,173
Oh... I didn't mean...

383
00:31:34,245 --> 00:31:35,707
It's okay.

384
00:31:35,782 --> 00:31:37,691
Look, I'm sorry.

385
00:31:39,045 --> 00:31:42,242
I guess I'm still upset over
a fight I just had with my dad.

386
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,591
I'm going to go back downstairs
and check on him.

387
00:31:46,662 --> 00:31:48,517
I'll be back
for Johnny in awhile.

388
00:31:49,605 --> 00:31:52,834
John, you still like
my stories, don't you?

389
00:31:54,022 --> 00:31:56,924
- It's him!
- Huh? Who?

390
00:32:01,062 --> 00:32:05,218
If it glows green, that's the time
to watch out for yourself.

391
00:32:09,061 --> 00:32:11,996
Her first frame
is a strike.

392
00:32:14,246 --> 00:32:17,820
Michelle led in the earlier
rounds in this tournament,

393
00:32:17,509 --> 00:32:21,503
and was the hot item around Southern
California when it came to sports.

394
00:32:21,574 --> 00:32:23,068
She really was.

395
00:32:23,142 --> 00:32:24,833
Yesterday,
in the second round...

396
00:32:24,902 --> 00:32:27,804
of match play, Steve,
she bowled incredibly.

397
00:32:27,878 --> 00:32:29,023
She had a 300...

398
00:32:40,678 --> 00:32:42,336
Hello?

399
00:32:48,838 --> 00:32:50,845
Frank?

400
00:32:56,678 --> 00:32:58,205
Frank, is that you...

401
00:32:59,718 --> 00:33:02,140
or some other rat?

402
00:33:02,502 --> 00:33:04,869
Well... huh.

403
00:33:21,157 --> 00:33:22,848
Terrific.

404
00:33:35,621 --> 00:33:37,793
You pervert.

405
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:46,111
We got varmints.

406
00:33:46,181 --> 00:33:47,937
Frank,

407
00:33:48,006 --> 00:33:50,144
what in the wild world
of Geraldo

408
00:33:50,213 --> 00:33:51,904
is going on down here?

409
00:33:58,534 --> 00:34:00,705
Oh my God.

410
00:34:14,309 --> 00:34:16,381
Oh, no!
What is it?!

411
00:34:19,846 --> 00:34:21,788
Aaah!

412
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:37,921
There's more of them!

413
00:34:39,141 --> 00:34:40,603
Get away.
Get away.

414
00:34:58,789 --> 00:35:01,986
Oh, no, no!
No, please!

415
00:35:02,053 --> 00:35:03,646
What are these things?!

416
00:35:03,718 --> 00:35:06,751
Annie! Annie, help me!
Get it off, get it off!

417
00:35:09,893 --> 00:35:11,682
Get me out of this.

418
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:13,059
Oh, Annie, hurry!

419
00:35:13,125 --> 00:35:15,132
Hurry, they're going
to come again!

420
00:35:15,205 --> 00:35:17,889
- Rosalie, give me some slack!
- Okay. Ow!

421
00:35:21,029 --> 00:35:23,331
It hurts.
It hurts.

422
00:35:24,901 --> 00:35:27,340
Frank.

423
00:35:26,565 --> 00:35:28,954
Oh, Annie, let's
get out of here!

424
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:30,972
Annie!

425
00:36:00,069 --> 00:36:01,629
Annie!

426
00:36:01,702 --> 00:36:03,228
Come on!

427
00:36:03,301 --> 00:36:04,795
Help me here. Okay.

428
00:36:04,869 --> 00:36:08,066
Feast your eyes on the future
site of Briggs' Mini Mall.

429
00:36:08,134 --> 00:36:09,825
Nice concept, huh?

430
00:36:09,894 --> 00:36:11,716
Naming it after
yours truly.

431
00:36:11,781 --> 00:36:13,755
But Mom said
the court ordered you

432
00:36:13,829 --> 00:36:17,026
to pay them money to move,
to relocate.

433
00:36:17,093 --> 00:36:19,614
Not if they move
on their own accord, sport.

434
00:36:21,125 --> 00:36:22,816
"Sport."

435
00:36:22,886 --> 00:36:26,017
There are much simpler ways
to sweep and clear.

436
00:36:26,085 --> 00:36:27,711
You'll see.

437
00:36:27,782 --> 00:36:30,120
You'll learn.

438
00:36:29,541 --> 00:36:31,232
Come on.

439
00:36:31,301 --> 00:36:32,828
I'll teach you.

440
00:36:41,061 --> 00:36:43,101
Oh God, please make
this a dream.

441
00:36:43,173 --> 00:36:45,061
Rosalie, come on!

442
00:36:45,125 --> 00:36:47,165
Come on.
Dad!

443
00:36:47,238 --> 00:36:49,245
- Dad!
- What?!

444
00:36:51,782 --> 00:36:53,691
Dad!

445
00:36:53,765 --> 00:36:55,009
Dad!

446
00:36:57,989 --> 00:37:01,056
- Oh, Dad, it was awful.
- There are things. They're huge!

447
00:37:01,126 --> 00:37:03,744
They're gigantic.
They're like rats! Rats!

448
00:37:03,814 --> 00:37:06,018
No, Tasmanian devils.

449
00:37:06,086 --> 00:37:07,711
- Slow down!
- Dozens of 'em.

450
00:37:07,781 --> 00:37:10,269
And they attacked me.
They had these white fang teeth.

451
00:37:10,341 --> 00:37:12,348
And they bit me!
They bit me on my leg!

452
00:37:13,381 --> 00:37:15,770
Oh my God,
I'm bleeding.

453
00:37:17,541 --> 00:37:18,970
Sit over here,
Rosie.

454
00:37:19,045 --> 00:37:21,740
Dad, they're little
animals...

455
00:37:21,509 --> 00:37:23,200
just like the ones
in the paper.

456
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:25,277
They've got lots
of sharp teeth.

457
00:37:25,349 --> 00:37:27,770
They're nasty things...
nasty things with sharp teeth.

458
00:37:27,845 --> 00:37:30,000
They're things
from outer space.

459
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,233
You can ask Mr. Menges
about it.

460
00:37:31,302 --> 00:37:33,669
Dad, they're aliens!

461
00:37:33,733 --> 00:37:36,290
Aliens in the basement?

462
00:37:35,557 --> 00:37:37,150
You have to believe her!
They're huge.

463
00:37:37,221 --> 00:37:40,036
They're like badger, possums...
they're big cats.

464
00:37:40,101 --> 00:37:43,300
You got to listen to her,
they're awful!

465
00:37:42,566 --> 00:37:44,704
Rosie, calm down,
calm down.

466
00:37:44,773 --> 00:37:47,643
- You just saw a rat.
- Will you look at her leg?

467
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:50,852
Oh, Rosie.

468
00:37:50,917 --> 00:37:52,990
A rat did this to you?
This is serious.

469
00:37:53,061 --> 00:37:55,996
They're not rats. They got
Frank in the basement.

470
00:37:56,069 --> 00:37:58,240
- They got Frank?
- They got Frank!

471
00:37:58,309 --> 00:37:59,836
They got Frank!

472
00:38:09,285 --> 00:38:10,779
Dad! Oh...

473
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:14,053
Dad, come on.

474
00:38:17,797 --> 00:38:18,942
Aaah!

475
00:38:22,917 --> 00:38:24,346
Dad, come on!

476
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:26,210
What are those things?!

477
00:38:27,525 --> 00:38:30,559
Go, go, go!

478
00:38:30,629 --> 00:38:34,011
In two tournaments I've seen
her shoot those 300 games.

479
00:38:34,085 --> 00:38:35,940
She can throw
the strikes.

480
00:38:45,765 --> 00:38:48,002
- She makes a strike.
- Eat that.

481
00:38:49,765 --> 00:38:51,805
God damn it.

482
00:38:51,877 --> 00:38:53,885
You see, sport?

483
00:38:53,957 --> 00:38:58,049
All kinds of animals
follow them around.

484
00:38:58,117 --> 00:39:01,084
These people are animals. Pretty
soon you can't tell them apart.

485
00:39:01,157 --> 00:39:04,255
The people, the pets...
they've all got fleas.

486
00:39:08,997 --> 00:39:10,524
This'll get
their attention.

487
00:39:12,677 --> 00:39:14,335
Their attention for what?

488
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,380
Our little panic...

489
00:39:17,541 --> 00:39:19,003
casserole.

490
00:39:20,773 --> 00:39:23,042
You think they're screaming
and carrying on now?

491
00:39:23,109 --> 00:39:25,346
Just wait till I cut off
their communication

492
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:27,104
with their social
workers.

493
00:39:29,893 --> 00:39:31,584
Hello?

494
00:39:31,654 --> 00:39:33,344
Hello?

495
00:39:34,534 --> 00:39:36,388
That's funny.

496
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:38,788
I lost contact
with Grover's Bend.

497
00:39:42,053 --> 00:39:45,349
What did he mean,
"Watch out for yourself"?

498
00:39:54,053 --> 00:39:55,908
Third floor...

499
00:39:55,973 --> 00:39:57,980
second floor...

500
00:39:58,053 --> 00:39:59,711
first floor...

501
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:03,107
basement.

502
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:07,000
Who turned out
the lights?!

503
00:40:08,293 --> 00:40:10,147
- Son of a bitch.
- Oh, Dad.

504
00:40:10,213 --> 00:40:12,384
How many stairs are
in this place anyway?

505
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:14,787
Wait, we just went up
these stairs.

506
00:40:14,853 --> 00:40:16,544
- I'm dizzy.
- Come on.

507
00:40:16,613 --> 00:40:18,337
What's your problem?

508
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:22,529
- I just want to rest.
- What are you guys doing down here?

509
00:40:22,597 --> 00:40:24,506
Marcia, come and help!
They're passing out.

510
00:40:24,581 --> 00:40:27,134
There are things,
they're like big rats.

511
00:40:27,205 --> 00:40:29,627
Only they bite and...
I forget.

512
00:40:29,701 --> 00:40:31,840
They're aliens.

513
00:40:31,909 --> 00:40:33,371
Porcupines!

514
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:35,355
Mrs. Menges!
Mrs. Menges!

515
00:40:36,709 --> 00:40:38,116
Come on, Cliff.

516
00:40:38,181 --> 00:40:39,905
Let me help you.
Lean on me.

517
00:40:39,973 --> 00:40:41,020
Up. Up.

518
00:40:41,093 --> 00:40:42,816
That's it.

519
00:40:42,885 --> 00:40:45,754
- Who are you?
- Marcia.

520
00:40:45,829 --> 00:40:47,356
You know me, Cliff.
Come on.

521
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:48,956
- Marcia?
- Yeah. Come on.

522
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:51,300
- Up, up. That's it.
- Yeah, okay.

523
00:40:50,565 --> 00:40:52,191
Thank you.

524
00:41:00,549 --> 00:41:02,207
Porcupines?

525
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:05,763
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

526
00:41:05,829 --> 00:41:08,797
Your landlord is here
to evict you.

527
00:41:15,525 --> 00:41:17,314
Jeez, a rat did that?

528
00:41:17,381 --> 00:41:20,643
Looks like I'll have to charge
somebody for a new door.

529
00:41:22,085 --> 00:41:23,808
Give me the keys.
I'll wait in the car.

530
00:41:23,877 --> 00:41:26,594
Forget it.
We're in this together.

531
00:41:28,645 --> 00:41:30,652
I thought you cut off
all the power.

532
00:41:30,725 --> 00:41:32,580
I did cut off
all the power.

533
00:41:34,245 --> 00:41:36,132
Can we just go?

534
00:41:36,197 --> 00:41:39,514
They must have tapped
into the emergency system.

535
00:41:39,589 --> 00:41:41,215
Hello?

536
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:47,330
It's your landlord.

537
00:41:48,645 --> 00:41:51,961
I have matters to discuss.

538
00:41:52,037 --> 00:41:54,720
...chicken has a wishbone,
which I'll cut out.

539
00:41:54,789 --> 00:41:57,539
All this makes
perfectly marvelous soup.

540
00:41:59,077 --> 00:42:01,379
You have to get
the leg bones out

541
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:03,136
from the legs
and the wing side.

542
00:42:03,205 --> 00:42:05,212
And the way
to do that is...

543
00:42:05,285 --> 00:42:06,976
push the bones through.

544
00:42:07,045 --> 00:42:10,787
And then take...
there's the... ball joint

545
00:42:10,853 --> 00:42:14,000
of your roast chicken.

546
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:15,844
We'll have our work done
in a minute, sport.

547
00:42:17,381 --> 00:42:19,236
Don't call me "sport."

548
00:42:22,981 --> 00:42:26,047
You're not a crybaby, too,
are you, sport?

549
00:42:39,781 --> 00:42:41,307
I hate you.

550
00:42:41,381 --> 00:42:43,040
I wish you were dead!

551
00:42:47,877 --> 00:42:49,055
Sport?

552
00:42:53,221 --> 00:42:55,075
Sport!

553
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:07,930
Hey, come on.

554
00:43:08,005 --> 00:43:10,045
Let me in.
Let him go.

555
00:43:10,117 --> 00:43:12,320
Hey. Hey!

556
00:43:11,556 --> 00:43:13,728
Hey, come on. He can't help
being an asshole!

557
00:43:13,797 --> 00:43:15,139
What are you doing?

558
00:43:15,205 --> 00:43:18,500
You're ready to remove
the bones.

559
00:43:19,090 --> 00:43:21,170
Hey, come on.
He just wants to talk to you!

560
00:43:20,548 --> 00:43:22,850
Leave him alone!
Let him go!

561
00:43:22,917 --> 00:43:24,957
Let him go!

562
00:43:25,029 --> 00:43:26,687
Hey, what's the matter?

563
00:43:26,757 --> 00:43:28,765
They've got him.
They're tearing him apart.

564
00:43:28,837 --> 00:43:30,527
- They're killing him!
- Who?! They've got who?

565
00:43:30,597 --> 00:43:32,920
Wait. Stop, stop.
Step back.

566
00:43:33,637 --> 00:43:34,847
Stay back.

567
00:44:29,253 --> 00:44:30,944
- Come on!
- What's going on?

568
00:44:31,013 --> 00:44:32,158
Never mind.
Run! Go!

569
00:44:32,229 --> 00:44:35,050
This way. Come on.

570
00:44:34,533 --> 00:44:36,059
Let's go.

571
00:44:36,132 --> 00:44:37,987
No, no, wait!
I can't just leave him there.

572
00:44:38,052 --> 00:44:40,507
That guy you were with,
your dad?

573
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:42,075
Stepfather.

574
00:44:42,148 --> 00:44:45,312
I don't know what the hell
is going on down there,

575
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:47,268
but I just saw
something there.

576
00:44:47,333 --> 00:44:49,886
There's animals,
some kind of hungry things.

577
00:44:49,957 --> 00:44:52,706
I don't know,
but he's dead, hon.

578
00:44:53,893 --> 00:44:55,551
There's nothing
we can do for him.

579
00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:00,195
- What's your name?
- Josh.

580
00:45:00,261 --> 00:45:02,650
Okay, Josh...

581
00:45:06,309 --> 00:45:07,683
Get back!

582
00:45:09,669 --> 00:45:11,774
Oh, look!

583
00:45:11,845 --> 00:45:13,852
- Come on!
- Do you have any more flares?

584
00:45:13,924 --> 00:45:15,910
Fresh out!

585
00:45:28,228 --> 00:45:30,138
What?

586
00:45:31,749 --> 00:45:33,123
Let us in!

587
00:45:35,749 --> 00:45:39,197
- Close the door!
- Josh!

588
00:45:40,741 --> 00:45:43,523
- Annie.
- Come on, help me move this desk.

589
00:45:46,309 --> 00:45:49,244
- Swing it around that way.
- What are you doing here?

590
00:45:49,317 --> 00:45:51,204
- I came with her.
- Marcia?

591
00:45:51,268 --> 00:45:53,505
Push it up against the door.
Right up tight.

592
00:45:53,573 --> 00:45:55,199
Great.
That should hold them.

593
00:45:56,709 --> 00:45:59,011
Josh, how did you get here?

594
00:46:00,389 --> 00:46:02,756
There's monsters outside,
aren't there?

595
00:46:04,325 --> 00:46:06,048
Yeah, there are monsters
out there.

596
00:46:06,117 --> 00:46:08,834
- Anybody check the phone?
- It's dead, like the lights.

597
00:46:10,724 --> 00:46:12,699
I still don't know
what the hell is going on here.

598
00:46:12,773 --> 00:46:14,682
Ain't no rats,
you can be sure of that.

599
00:46:16,324 --> 00:46:17,699
What are you
talking about?

600
00:46:17,765 --> 00:46:20,896
Did you ever see one of these
come out of any rat you've seen?

601
00:46:23,845 --> 00:46:25,536
Ain't no rats.

602
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,055
Must be venom...
poison.

603
00:46:52,610 --> 00:46:53,827
They're here!

604
00:46:53,893 --> 00:46:56,194
I saw the door downstairs,
they chewed right through it.

605
00:47:05,604 --> 00:47:07,612
What do you say we barricade
the kitchen door?

606
00:47:08,901 --> 00:47:10,275
What kitchen door?

607
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:16,991
Mr. Menges, you don't have
a gun up here

608
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:18,205
or anything like that?

609
00:47:18,276 --> 00:47:19,967
I got a great
Civil War pistol.

610
00:47:20,037 --> 00:47:22,274
I used to have a frame
for it.

611
00:47:22,341 --> 00:47:23,934
I got no powder.

612
00:47:24,005 --> 00:47:25,663
How about a big knife?

613
00:47:25,733 --> 00:47:29,028
How about
a meat cleaver, dear?

614
00:47:33,861 --> 00:47:35,868
You find anything there?

615
00:47:35,941 --> 00:47:37,315
No.

616
00:47:41,861 --> 00:47:43,203
Wait.

617
00:47:43,269 --> 00:47:46,200
What's that?

618
00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:49,306
Oh. As I recall,
that's a little storage area.

619
00:47:49,381 --> 00:47:52,676
Mr. Menges and I haven't
crawled up there in years.

620
00:47:52,741 --> 00:47:54,710
Josh, come here!

621
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,322
Do you have a footstool
or something?

622
00:47:56,389 --> 00:47:57,763
In the pantry.

623
00:48:16,613 --> 00:48:18,915
Hey, you guys,
check this out.

624
00:48:18,981 --> 00:48:21,315
Mrs. Menges, does this
connect with the roof?

625
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:23,552
I really don't know
where that goes.

626
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:26,750
You get up there
and you crawl...

627
00:48:26,501 --> 00:48:27,930
crawl that direction,

628
00:48:28,004 --> 00:48:29,630
and you'll hit
the elevator shaft.

629
00:48:29,701 --> 00:48:32,254
- You don't know that.
- I'll get the others.

630
00:48:32,325 --> 00:48:35,042
Sure I do. I've stored
stuff up there.

631
00:48:43,141 --> 00:48:46,150
Do you think you guys
can climb a ladder?

632
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:47,067
No ladder.

633
00:48:47,141 --> 00:48:49,378
Go up a ladder
tomorrow.

634
00:48:49,850 --> 00:48:50,525
No.

635
00:48:50,596 --> 00:48:52,735
No tomorrow.

636
00:48:52,804 --> 00:48:54,975
I can't do this
anymore, Dad!

637
00:48:55,044 --> 00:48:56,506
Move your ass, now!

638
00:49:00,165 --> 00:49:02,783
Now.

639
00:49:04,836 --> 00:49:06,527
Come on, Clifford.

640
00:49:06,597 --> 00:49:08,931
We've been climbing
three flights of stairs

641
00:49:08,996 --> 00:49:10,851
ever since that elevator
broke down.

642
00:49:10,917 --> 00:49:12,924
Come on.
You can do it.

643
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:28,766
It's gotten too quiet
out there.

644
00:49:28,836 --> 00:49:30,210
I don't like it.

645
00:49:30,277 --> 00:49:31,967
They'll just get in
some other way.

646
00:49:32,036 --> 00:49:33,510
We got to get out
of here!

647
00:49:34,170 --> 00:49:35,779
Rosalie, come on.
We got to go. You're next.

648
00:49:35,845 --> 00:49:37,819
I'll watch the door.

649
00:49:37,892 --> 00:49:39,648
- Oh, no.
- Up, Rosalie.

650
00:49:39,716 --> 00:49:41,724
- Right.
- All right.

651
00:49:41,796 --> 00:49:44,284
- Come on, you can do it.
- I'll help you.

652
00:49:50,628 --> 00:49:52,090
You know...

653
00:49:52,165 --> 00:49:53,856
if we can make it
to the roof,

654
00:49:53,925 --> 00:49:56,259
I can get to
the junction box outside,

655
00:49:56,324 --> 00:49:58,593
tie into the phone lines,
call for help.

656
00:49:59,812 --> 00:50:01,983
- You can do that?
- Hey, I can do anything...

657
00:50:02,053 --> 00:50:03,613
I work for
the phone company.

658
00:50:03,685 --> 00:50:06,619
- Push.
- Ow, ow, ow.

659
00:50:06,692 --> 00:50:08,635
- Up, Rosalie.
- Push.

660
00:50:08,708 --> 00:50:10,017
Come on. Go.

661
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:13,693
- Push, fair Rosie, come on!
- Help.

662
00:50:13,764 --> 00:50:16,699
Push!
Push, Josh.

663
00:50:16,773 --> 00:50:18,944
We've come this far.
Come on, help her.

664
00:50:21,253 --> 00:50:25,220
Look, dear, the quilt that
Aunt Carolyn gave us, remember?

665
00:50:24,549 --> 00:50:26,980
Yeah, I remember.
Come on, let's go.

666
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:32,820
Everybody be calm.

667
00:50:32,516 --> 00:50:34,272
Go!

668
00:50:49,636 --> 00:50:51,098
Go... quick!

669
00:50:53,988 --> 00:50:55,843
Grab that, quick!

670
00:50:57,349 --> 00:50:59,040
- Go!
- They're over here!

671
00:52:10,244 --> 00:52:11,935
Josh, come on.
Keep going.

672
00:52:12,004 --> 00:52:14,819
- Which way do I go?
- Give me the flashlight.

673
00:52:14,884 --> 00:52:17,121
Kids, here!
Right through there.

674
00:52:19,045 --> 00:52:21,533
You stay with them and try
and keep everybody together.

675
00:52:21,604 --> 00:52:23,197
I'm gonna check out
this direction.

676
00:52:23,268 --> 00:52:25,341
Marcia! Be careful.

677
00:52:40,932 --> 00:52:43,320
Come on, Annie.

678
00:52:42,564 --> 00:52:43,939
Annie.

679
00:52:54,117 --> 00:52:55,873
It won't open.

680
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:02,169
Please!

681
00:53:08,261 --> 00:53:10,399
It won't open.

682
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:12,803
We're trapped.

683
00:53:12,868 --> 00:53:14,275
Where's Marcia?

684
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:26,710
Oh, damn it.

685
00:53:28,010 --> 00:53:29,151
I'm lost.

686
00:53:36,101 --> 00:53:38,108
Josh...

687
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:40,035
what are you
doing here?

688
00:53:41,701 --> 00:53:44,290
I came here
with my stepdad.

689
00:53:51,396 --> 00:53:53,633
We came here
to evict you.

690
00:53:57,636 --> 00:53:59,327
I didn't want
to come.

691
00:54:02,916 --> 00:54:04,575
Pretty awful, huh?

692
00:54:05,796 --> 00:54:07,203
Yeah.

693
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,386
I just can't believe
he's dead.

694
00:54:13,316 --> 00:54:15,618
Josh...

695
00:54:15,684 --> 00:54:17,888
my mom died.

696
00:54:18,916 --> 00:54:20,607
Not like your dad,

697
00:54:21,636 --> 00:54:23,163
but she died.

698
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:28,770
But I bet you didn't wish
for your mom to die.

699
00:54:32,837 --> 00:54:35,258
I just wish we could
go back to this morning.

700
00:54:38,116 --> 00:54:40,702
I just wish we could figure out
how to use this thing.

701
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:47,646
Look...

702
00:55:47,716 --> 00:55:50,083
if nobody can think
of anything better,

703
00:55:50,149 --> 00:55:53,116
one of us has got to make it
to the street and run for help.

704
00:55:53,188 --> 00:55:56,504
The only way I know
to get around them things

705
00:55:56,580 --> 00:55:59,165
is this elevator shaft.

706
00:55:59,236 --> 00:56:00,164
Hey.

707
00:56:00,228 --> 00:56:01,919
I got a better idea.

708
00:56:20,068 --> 00:56:21,856
How do you get
to the box?

709
00:56:21,924 --> 00:56:23,834
Redundant cable.

710
00:56:23,908 --> 00:56:25,763
Keeps the lines
from blowing down.

711
00:56:25,828 --> 00:56:29,190
It ought to hold my weight
long enough for me to...

712
00:56:30,628 --> 00:56:32,154
get connected.

713
00:56:33,349 --> 00:56:35,039
I'm down to 119.

714
00:56:35,108 --> 00:56:37,378
Marcia, you're going
to die out there.

715
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:39,899
Any calls you want me
to make for you?

716
00:56:41,252 --> 00:56:43,292
Come on.
Belay me.

717
00:56:50,244 --> 00:56:51,935
Adios.

718
00:57:18,532 --> 00:57:20,801
Oh God.

719
00:57:26,084 --> 00:57:27,361
Josh!

720
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:28,955
Josh, we're on fire!

721
00:57:32,804 --> 00:57:34,331
One thing at a time.

722
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:37,055
Marcia, one thing
at a time.

723
00:57:39,941 --> 00:57:41,598
- Oh my God. Marcia!
- Marcia!

724
00:57:49,124 --> 00:57:51,393
She's swinging.
She's swinging!

725
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:52,802
Annie, it's okay...

726
00:57:56,964 --> 00:57:58,393
Thank you.
Thank you.

727
00:57:59,972 --> 00:58:02,874
Phone. Phone!

728
00:58:02,948 --> 00:58:04,573
Phone, phone.

729
00:58:06,212 --> 00:58:08,560
Let's go.

730
00:58:09,604 --> 00:58:12,254
Yes. Go. Yes!

731
00:58:14,244 --> 00:58:15,935
Oh no.

732
00:58:16,004 --> 00:58:18,060
Damn. Damn.

733
00:58:22,084 --> 00:58:23,980
Go, go!

734
00:58:23,524 --> 00:58:25,793
Yes, yes, yes!
Yes!

735
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:27,289
No! No, no.

736
00:58:27,364 --> 00:58:28,738
Yes, yes.

737
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:38,111
I can do this.

738
00:58:53,540 --> 00:58:55,034
Annie.

739
00:58:57,220 --> 00:58:58,747
I'm going for help.

740
00:58:58,819 --> 00:59:01,275
It's okay. I'm gonna
take care of everything.

741
00:59:04,804 --> 00:59:05,982
Annie.

742
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:09,311
Annie!
Don't go down there.

743
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:11,387
That's too dangerous.
You come on back here.

744
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,315
Let somebody else
do that.

745
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:16,987
Second floor.

746
01:00:03,556 --> 01:00:05,083
Nothing to it.

747
01:01:55,940 --> 01:01:58,209
All right, get back...
get back into the elevator.

748
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:00,737
I got you, you hear?

749
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:18,976
Oh, gee.

750
01:02:22,083 --> 01:02:23,980
It's jammed.

751
01:02:23,524 --> 01:02:25,858
It's okay.
Sometimes it does this.

752
01:02:27,364 --> 01:02:29,219
What?!

753
01:02:33,284 --> 01:02:35,139
You came here
just in time.

754
01:02:35,204 --> 01:02:38,130
Where's your family?
Take me to them.

755
01:02:37,540 --> 01:02:39,744
Well, the elevator's stuck.
We have to climb.

756
01:02:41,124 --> 01:02:42,651
How did you get here?

757
01:02:42,724 --> 01:02:44,550
A gentlemen called me.

758
01:02:45,230 --> 01:02:45,858
A real nice fella.

759
01:02:53,124 --> 01:02:55,380
All right.

760
01:03:19,683 --> 01:03:21,920
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

761
01:03:23,044 --> 01:03:25,629
Hold on!
Floor, please?!

762
01:03:25,699 --> 01:03:27,074
The roof!

763
01:03:38,020 --> 01:03:39,547
Somebody help us
out of here.

764
01:03:39,620 --> 01:03:42,140
I'm stuck.

765
01:03:57,060 --> 01:03:58,653
Hey, it's you.

766
01:03:58,724 --> 01:04:00,928
Yeah, what's left of me.

767
01:04:00,996 --> 01:04:02,589
The building
is burning downstairs.

768
01:04:02,660 --> 01:04:04,001
We've got
to get on the roof.

769
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:11,554
Don't look. Don't...

770
01:04:11,620 --> 01:04:13,987
be casual.

771
01:04:14,051 --> 01:04:17,313
Who is that hunk that
just came in with your daughter?

772
01:04:26,916 --> 01:04:28,607
Charlie.

773
01:04:30,339 --> 01:04:33,187
- Hi.
- How you doing, partner?

774
01:04:34,275 --> 01:04:36,315
I guess you were right
about those things.

775
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:40,607
See if you can pry
that bullet out of there.

776
01:04:40,676 --> 01:04:42,203
My fingers are too big.

777
01:04:43,875 --> 01:04:45,217
What about Marcia?

778
01:04:48,996 --> 01:04:50,850
Yes. Yes!

779
01:04:55,843 --> 01:04:57,731
Yes! Yes! Yes!

780
01:05:08,356 --> 01:05:11,651
Please deposit 25
for the first three minutes.

781
01:05:11,715 --> 01:05:13,090
Damn!

782
01:05:14,212 --> 01:05:15,870
I hate operators.

783
01:05:31,203 --> 01:05:33,058
Quiet.

784
01:05:38,179 --> 01:05:39,226
Everybody quiet.

785
01:05:42,692 --> 01:05:46,008
If you're quiet,
you can hear them moving.

786
01:06:11,587 --> 01:06:13,311
- Annie, my gun.
- I'm trying!

787
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:14,656
It won't come out.

788
01:06:21,924 --> 01:06:23,615
All right,
keep your eyes on them.

789
01:06:25,027 --> 01:06:26,271
Look 'em in the eye.

790
01:06:28,259 --> 01:06:30,048
They'll telegraph
their every move.

791
01:06:52,579 --> 01:06:53,986
I hate you!

792
01:07:01,347 --> 01:07:02,874
Josh!

793
01:07:06,147 --> 01:07:08,187
You leave
my husband alone!

794
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:23,865
Annie.

795
01:07:25,667 --> 01:07:27,096
Annie?

796
01:07:32,227 --> 01:07:34,115
Charlie!

797
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:40,835
Open wide.

798
01:07:55,075 --> 01:07:56,701
We got 'em!

799
01:07:57,828 --> 01:07:58,908
Come on, let's go!

800
01:07:58,980 --> 01:08:02,329
Mobile Ops 7707.

801
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:04,094
Emergency.

802
01:08:05,188 --> 01:08:06,235
Oh God!

803
01:08:11,043 --> 01:08:12,570
Come on, Johnny.

804
01:08:18,723 --> 01:08:20,250
Stay here.

805
01:08:23,363 --> 01:08:26,178
Fire! Help us!

806
01:08:26,243 --> 01:08:27,934
Can anyone hear me?!

807
01:08:28,003 --> 01:08:29,694
Please, help us!

808
01:08:29,763 --> 01:08:31,610
Can't you see us?!

809
01:08:32,675 --> 01:08:33,690
We're on fire!

810
01:08:33,763 --> 01:08:35,618
Come over here.
Somebody help!

811
01:08:35,683 --> 01:08:38,203
It's really burning.
Up there, can you hear us?!

812
01:08:38,275 --> 01:08:40,540
- There's a fire here!
- Is anybody up there?!

813
01:08:41,230 --> 01:08:42,654
- What are we going to do?
- Hang on. Hang on.

814
01:08:42,723 --> 01:08:45,058
- We'll be all right.
- Please, help us.

815
01:08:45,123 --> 01:08:46,650
You were wonderful.

816
01:08:46,724 --> 01:08:48,540
You were wonderful.

817
01:08:49,230 --> 01:08:51,310
- Thank you very much.
- You saved us all.

818
01:08:50,564 --> 01:08:52,124
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

819
01:08:52,196 --> 01:08:55,611
Please, fire!
Come on!

820
01:08:56,643 --> 01:08:58,710
Fire!

821
01:09:20,036 --> 01:09:22,108
Somebody help us!
We're on fire!

822
01:09:26,051 --> 01:09:27,742
Are you okay?

823
01:09:33,603 --> 01:09:35,676
Can you stand?

824
01:09:35,748 --> 01:09:37,057
No, I can't.

825
01:09:39,139 --> 01:09:41,376
Johnny, get away
from the edge!

826
01:09:41,830 --> 01:09:43,134
But Marcia's down there.

827
01:09:43,203 --> 01:09:45,145
I don't care.
Get over here now!

828
01:09:46,979 --> 01:09:49,314
Listen to me.
Get over here!

829
01:09:49,379 --> 01:09:51,038
Look, Annie, look!

830
01:09:59,107 --> 01:10:00,351
Charlie!

831
01:10:09,700 --> 01:10:12,285
- I got you.
- Help!

832
01:10:15,670 --> 01:10:16,987
Don't look down.

833
01:10:17,059 --> 01:10:18,750
Annie, don't let go!

834
01:10:21,316 --> 01:10:22,842
Annie, I'm slipping.

835
01:10:22,915 --> 01:10:24,344
Hold on, Johnny.

836
01:10:24,590 --> 01:10:26,558
Please,
somebody help me!

837
01:10:38,596 --> 01:10:40,122
I got you.

838
01:10:40,195 --> 01:10:42,050
I got you.
I got you.

839
01:10:48,995 --> 01:10:50,686
I love you.

840
01:10:55,235 --> 01:10:56,926
Help!

841
01:10:56,996 --> 01:11:00,062
- Charlie?
- Help!

842
01:11:00,131 --> 01:11:01,505
Get help!

843
01:11:04,099 --> 01:11:06,200
Charlie.

844
01:11:22,852 --> 01:11:24,706
Throw me a rope.
Get a rope!

845
01:11:24,772 --> 01:11:26,298
Dad, we got to do
something.

846
01:11:29,891 --> 01:11:31,778
Oh, no. Oh, no!

847
01:11:31,843 --> 01:11:33,731
Charlie, look out.

848
01:11:56,899 --> 01:12:00,761
Hey... I hope you'll
let me down easier than that.

849
01:12:39,108 --> 01:12:40,798
Outer space all right.

850
01:12:40,867 --> 01:12:42,722
No doubt about it.
We can prove it.

851
01:12:42,787 --> 01:12:45,919
- We could've proved it except...
- It was all burnt up in there.

852
01:12:45,987 --> 01:12:47,994
Documented proof.
All my papers.

853
01:12:48,067 --> 01:12:50,074
Actual physical evidence...
gone.

854
01:12:53,187 --> 01:12:55,009
- Hi.
- Hi.

855
01:12:58,700 --> 01:13:00,738
Oh. I'll be
over there, okay?

856
01:13:02,243 --> 01:13:05,025
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

857
01:13:06,819 --> 01:13:09,208
So... how 'bout
getting together sometime,

858
01:13:09,283 --> 01:13:10,810
and doing
something normal?

859
01:13:12,323 --> 01:13:15,138
- Normal like a movie?
- Yeah.

860
01:13:20,163 --> 01:13:22,335
Charlie!

861
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:23,930
Don't go.

862
01:13:27,523 --> 01:13:28,897
Listen, partner,

863
01:13:28,963 --> 01:13:31,300
how's that
crystal doing?

864
01:13:36,323 --> 01:13:37,697
Yeah.

865
01:13:37,763 --> 01:13:39,290
See?

866
01:13:39,363 --> 01:13:41,054
There's no more
problem.

867
01:13:42,243 --> 01:13:44,894
- You don't need me anymore.
- Johnny.

868
01:13:44,963 --> 01:13:46,654
Come here a minute.

869
01:13:46,723 --> 01:13:48,540
Bye, Charlie.

870
01:13:49,603 --> 01:13:50,944
Bye, John.

871
01:13:56,590 --> 01:13:58,906
Are you leaving
today, Daddy?

872
01:13:58,979 --> 01:14:00,986
I think I finally got
the message

873
01:14:01,059 --> 01:14:03,034
you guys want me
to stay close to home.

874
01:14:03,107 --> 01:14:04,765
My uniform's
all burnt up,

875
01:14:04,835 --> 01:14:07,388
so I think the railroad
can get along without me.

876
01:14:11,778 --> 01:14:14,593
Dad, can we survive?

877
01:14:14,659 --> 01:14:16,830
Well, we've just been
talking about that.

878
01:14:16,899 --> 01:14:18,754
I think I'll check out
those jobs

879
01:14:18,819 --> 01:14:20,161
down at
the phone company.

880
01:14:20,227 --> 01:14:22,398
And between the Menges
and us,

881
01:14:23,070 --> 01:14:24,191
we'll work something out.

882
01:14:24,259 --> 01:14:27,106
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

883
01:14:27,171 --> 01:14:29,921
- I'm Josh's mother.
- How do you do?

884
01:14:31,139 --> 01:14:33,888
Josh has told me about
all you've done for him.

885
01:14:33,956 --> 01:14:35,865
And my husband...

886
01:14:35,939 --> 01:14:39,103
my late husband, he owes you
people quite a bit of money.

887
01:14:39,171 --> 01:14:42,520
- He does?
- It's called a relocation fee.

888
01:14:42,595 --> 01:14:45,246
And I think with that,
you'd be able to stay in a hotel

889
01:14:45,315 --> 01:14:46,876
until we get
the place rebuilt.

890
01:14:46,947 --> 01:14:50,525
- That is, if you'd be interested.
- We're interested.

891
01:14:50,595 --> 01:14:52,286
And thank you.

892
01:14:54,150 --> 01:14:55,809
Why don't we introduce
ourselves?

893
01:14:55,875 --> 01:14:58,745
Johnny, where's your friend
from Grover's Bend?

894
01:15:02,150 --> 01:15:02,882
Charlie?

895
01:15:02,947 --> 01:15:04,321
He left.

896
01:15:04,387 --> 01:15:07,202
Just like one
of those westerns.

897
01:15:07,267 --> 01:15:10,747
No. No.

898
01:17:11,171 --> 01:17:13,505
All right, you gumballs.

899
01:17:59,990 --> 01:18:00,887
What is that?

900
01:18:44,003 --> 01:18:47,680
Bounty hunter Charles McFadden,
Earth sector...

901
01:18:47,747 --> 01:18:49,056
you are in violation.

902
01:18:49,122 --> 01:18:50,977
Violation?

903
01:18:51,043 --> 01:18:54,817
Wait a second.
I'm just killing Critters here.

904
01:18:54,882 --> 01:18:56,573
That is...

905
01:18:57,762 --> 01:19:00,031
there was a confirmed
infestation...

906
01:19:00,099 --> 01:19:01,855
of Crites.

907
01:19:02,883 --> 01:19:04,377
Charlie.

908
01:19:07,107 --> 01:19:08,568
Is that you in there?

909
01:19:22,722 --> 01:19:24,530
Charlie, my friend.

910
01:19:26,243 --> 01:19:28,540
Wow. It's great
to see you.

911
01:19:29,230 --> 01:19:31,300
And you as well.

912
01:19:36,579 --> 01:19:38,270
You're looking good.

913
01:19:38,338 --> 01:19:40,830
We just received
your bio alert.

914
01:19:40,514 --> 01:19:42,554
Yeah, yeah.
What was that all about?

915
01:19:42,627 --> 01:19:45,626
Specifically,
you are prohibited

916
01:19:45,699 --> 01:19:47,870
from terminating
any transgalactic lifeform

917
01:19:47,939 --> 01:19:50,077
if it means total extinction
of the species.

918
01:19:50,147 --> 01:19:52,034
Oh, yeah.
But they're dangerous.

919
01:19:52,099 --> 01:19:53,855
You taught me
how dangerous they are.

920
01:19:53,923 --> 01:19:55,898
Aggression factor
is irrelevant.

921
01:19:55,970 --> 01:19:58,720
Those two eggs
are the last two eggs.

922
01:19:58,787 --> 01:20:01,089
The intergalactic council
has dispatched

923
01:20:01,155 --> 01:20:02,813
a specimen collection pod.

924
01:20:02,882 --> 01:20:04,606
You are instructed
to place the eggs

925
01:20:04,674 --> 01:20:06,682
into the receptacle
in the pod.

926
01:20:08,163 --> 01:20:10,720
The council is sending
a pod here?

927
01:20:11,390 --> 01:20:12,025
Come on, Ug...

928
01:20:12,099 --> 01:20:14,848
Good luck, Charlie,
my friend.

929
01:20:16,259 --> 01:20:17,786
Yeah, but Ug...

930
01:20:17,858 --> 01:20:22,100
Wait a second.
What am I supposed to...

931
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:33,100
