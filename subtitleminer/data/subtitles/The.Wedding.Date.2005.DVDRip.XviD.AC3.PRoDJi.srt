00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,479
'Hi, this is Kat.
Leave a message and I'll call you back.'

2
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,672
'Hi, Kat. This is Nick Mercer.

3
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,949
'Sorry I didn't get back to you last night
but I got your messages.

4
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,439
'All seven of them.

5
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:59,473
'I know you're nervous, Kat,
but this is what I get paid for.

6
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,395
'I'm running late so
I sent a messenger to pick up my ticket.

7
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,914
'Kat, stop worrying.

8
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,230
'Your ex-fiancé will wish he never left you

9
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,993
'and your family will think we're in love.

10
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,829
'Trust me. I'll see you at the airport.
Can't wait to meet you.'

11
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,393
So sorry. I wasn't quite ready.

12
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,871
It's a plane ticket.

13
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,155
For a date. My date.

14
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,360
For my sister's wedding, in London.

15
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,913
You need to let go.

16
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,837
You're gonna have to help me.

17
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,560
"Oh yeah

18
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,197

"I'm losing the will to try

00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,670
"Can't hide it, can't fight it
"Can't hide, can't fight

58
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,518
Harry, I'm not working,
I'm going to my sister's wedding.

59
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,200
Customer service
will have to survive without me.

60
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,590
But Kat, we've had three delays
and two reps call in sick.

61
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,156
And a 2505 on the 8:20 CPT to LGW.

62
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,037
And there's this guy on line two

63
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,238
who gut stuck with in-laws because
we couldn't get him out of Heathrow.

64
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,074
I'd love to help you, sincerely,
but I haven't seen my family in two years

65
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,435
and my flight leaves in 15 minutes.

66
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,759
Come on, Kat. Please, I'm begging you.

67
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,436
Bump the 14:14 to the upper on 16:10.

68
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,431
What about line two?

69
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,551
Check my bags.

70
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,559
I understand, you want your family
to see you the way you see yourself,

71
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,995
or would, if you didn't feel
so victimized by them.

72
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,714
Hello!

73
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,555
We regret that you were inconvenienced.
Unfortunately, we are not liable.

74
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:23,358
But just this once I'll refund your ticket
and credit you 10,000 frequent flyer miles.

75
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,874
Thank you for calling Virgin Atlantic.

76
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,796
Your first trip?

77
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,231
My sister's getting married
and the best man is my ex.

78
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,437
If I chicken out,
I wanna know where the exits are.

79
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,795
I'm not a knuckler, I fly all the time.

80
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,836
The reason I can't feel my legs

81
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,957
is that any second
my date is gonna sit down in 3B

82
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,310
and I need him to look really good today.

83
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,391
Hello, 3B.

84
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,872
Thank you.

85
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,832
Hey.

86
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,592
Kat.

87
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,558
Let's sit.

88
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,517
I'm glad you found it OK.

89
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,350
The airport... The plane, I mean.

90
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:51,950
I'm sorry we couldn't leave sooner. I know you
wanted to get settled before the party.

91
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,917
Work must be crazy.

92
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,670
Oh, I should warn you.

93
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,837
You know those families
where everyone's out of their mind

94
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,229
but they're your family so you love them?

95
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,753
Mine's not like that.

96
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,869
I love my dad.

97
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,555
But since he's my stepdad,
he's technically not family.

98
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,073
He's more like a hostage.

99
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,393
'Ladies and gentlemen,

100
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,029
'we will shortly be arriving
at London Heathrow.

101
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,190
'On arrival, please remain seated

102
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:57,716
'until the seat belt sign
has been switched off.

103
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,394
'Local time is 4:22pm

104
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,357
'and the temperature is a warm 21... '

105
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,960
Good morning.

106
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,997
'That's 72 degrees Fahrenheit.

107
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,554
'We would like to thank you
for flying with us today

108
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,194
'and look forward to seeing you again soon.'

109
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,395
Oh.

110
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,435
Nick, please tell me
you're not wearing that tonight.

111
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,590
I am.

112
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:31,120
It's no big deal really, it just looks like
a tailor made your tie out of my dress.

113
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:36,752
Don't get me wrong - matching's fine.
It's matchy-matchy you wanna look out for.

114
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,678
- We look like we're trying too hard.
- Exactly.

115
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,236
I want us to look like we fit
but not like we're trying to look like we fit.

116
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,191
Let me teach you a trick.

117
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,313
If you look people in the eye,
they'll never notice what you're wearing.

118
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,392
There's no way I'm showing up
in his and her outfits

119
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,400
so if you're gonna wear that tie,
I have to change my dress.

120
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,153
Driver, will you please
pull over somewhere?

121
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,791
I'm sorry. I promise this is the last one.

122
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,314
You must think...
Who knows what you think?

123
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,670
I know how important this is for you.

124
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,673
But remember, you're a beautiful woman
and you've got everything going for you.

125
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,313
Don't patronize me.

126
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,113
I feel like crap but I wanna look hot doing it.

127
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,429
Mission accomplished.

128
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,794
Really?

129
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,910
Don't get too attached.

130
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,191
I prefer the red one.

131
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,316
I'll let her know.

132
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,519
Hmm...

133
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,353
"Hmm, nice dress," or "Hmm...

134
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,795
"Gorgeous. I was insane to let you go"?

135
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,549
Well, I'd shag you.

136
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,392
If that's all right with you?

137
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,438
I don't know if I can do this.

138
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:17,479
Well, you can never be sure of anything
but we still have to go inside.

139
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,953
- Aunt Bea!
- Dear girl.

140
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,793
This should have been you getting married.

141
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,952
You know, you didn't have
to return the gravy boat.

142
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,918
And to think Jeffrey is the best man.

143
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,752
Have you met Nick?

144
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,717
- How do you do?
- Oh.

145
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,637
Charming.

146
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,358
And what do you do?

147
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,789
Excuse us.

148
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,157
What a nightmare.

149
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,519
OK, we need a story.

150
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:06,718
You're a therapist, we just started dating and
you're crazy about me.

151
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,315
Count it. 6,000 even.

152
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,870
- Oh, I trust you.
- No. Count it.

153
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,119
All right.

154
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,673
I'll cover expenses but if you want
to be intimate, we talk money first.

155
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,469
That won't be an issue. I find the idea
of sex for money morally repugnant.

156
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,478
I'm sorry. No offense.

157
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,436
Do me a favor, quit apologizing.

158
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,478
If you look at this as a business transaction,

159
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,074
maybe you won't
feel compelled to keep saying sorry.

160
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,639
I'm sorry.

161
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,278
It's also really annoying.

162
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,793
Sorry.

163
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,997
- Sorry.
- Pussy Kat! What happened to you?

164
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:15,232
- Pull over for a quickie?
- Mom, this is so not the time to be yourself.

165
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,711
And who might this be?

166
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,519
Hi. I'm the new guy.
It's great to meet you.

167
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,831
Lovely. This is a marathon, not a sprint.

168
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,837
We've got welcome cocktails today

169
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:29,111
then tomorrow's Young People In The Park
and Stags And Hens.

170
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:35,230
Friday's the picnic, then the rehearsal dinner
and since you have left no margin for jetlag,

171
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,276
I need you to hydrate.

172
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,828
- Dad.
- My darling.

173
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,994
- Meet Nick.
- Professor Ellis.

174
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,310
- How do you do?
- Kat?

175
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,078
- Kat! Oooh! I'm getting married! Oh, Kitty!
- Hey!

176
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,479
Oh, I missed you so much.

177
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,353
Gosh, who's the hunky, huh? Nice.

178
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,715
There you are! Get over here!

179
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,597
At times like these,
I find a good, stiff drink helps.

180
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,553
- Can I get you a refill, sir?
- Very kind of you.

181
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,357
Where did you find him?

182
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,192
Thank you.

183
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,032
Yellow Pages.

184
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,756
Hello!

185
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,040
Sweet Jesus.
Who gave that woman an amp?

186
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,270
Hello. Hello?

187
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,392
Oh. Wonderful. It's finally working.

188
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:35,559
Does everybody have a drink?
Because I am going to say a few words.

189
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,154
Welcome, friends and family...

190
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,674
I'm...

191
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,594
Victor and I are so happy

192
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,433
that you're here to celebrate with us

193
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:50,752
as we welcome Edward and
the Fletcher-Wootens into our family.

194
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:55,118
We always thought that
we would marry off Kat first.

195
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:59,716
We had good reason to hope because
she was so popular with the boys at school

196
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,671
and we came pretty close once,

197
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,116
but, as you all know,
that crashed and burned.

198
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,991
Luckily, we were able
to get the deposit back,

199
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,550
so here we are again...

200
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,917
To the bride and groom.

201
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:23,635
Oh. Yes. Yes. Well, back
to the bride and groom to be.

202
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,995
Um...

203
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:32,871
Edward, we are so glad that
you fell in love with the girl next door.

204
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,833
Our Amy. Congratulations, babies.

205
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,354
Congratulations.

206
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,069
Jeffrey.

207
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,439
Hello. Kat-mandu.

208
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,390
Wow, you look gorgeous.

209
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,233
Gorgeous.

210
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,550
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

211
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:19,269
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God! Top Kat! Ooooh!

212
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,672
Where the bloody hell have you been?
I have gynecologists that call more often.

213
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:28,072
- You have more than one?
- I play them off against each other.

214
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,153
Hello, arsehole.
Since you dumped my cousin brutally,

215
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,310
you won't mind if I steal her away, will you?

216
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,356
Thanks.

217
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,117
- You didn't have to do that.
- I wasn't saving you from him,

218
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,111
I was saving you from yourself.

219
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,192
You, my love, are too bloody nice.

220
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:55,069
I've never seen so many
beautiful women in one room.

221
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,354
Did he bring a date?

222
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,238
Darling, why waste time on that horse's arse

223
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,790
when Mr. Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down
is waiting for you over there?

224
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,030
- What does he do?
- He's a therapist.

225
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:09,231
- The perils of paranoia.
- Yes.

226
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,476
Oh, God. I think I've just come.

227
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,194
Thank you.

228
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,157
Can I have that?

229
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,872
Hm.

230
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,596
Thank you.

231
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,035
You know what I love about all this, Kat?

232
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,833
There's finally a reason for
the world to revolve around you?

233
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,558
Exactly.

234
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,079
- There you are.
- How's the future missus?

235
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,037
I'm perfect, I'm all ginny.

236
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,475
Thanks, Snufflepop.

237
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,595
Mmm! Mm-mm-mm!

238
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,518
Wow!

239
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,273
Am I not the luckiest bastard on earth?

240
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,875
Aw! Well, I'll dance to that.

241
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,237
- Oh!
- Oh, Jesus!

242
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,879
That's what he gets
for not taking dance lessons

243
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,349
until two days before the wedding.

244
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,153
Who's ever heard of
dance lessons for a wedding?

245
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,629
Just about everyone.

246
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,392
You are taking the piss?

247
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,913
We'll go with you.

248
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,798
I don't even know you, hunky dunky,
and I love you already.

249
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,593
Dance lessons? Hm. Right.

250
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,556
- Hey.
- Oh. Hello.

251
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,277
Weddings are a celebration
of love and commitment...

252
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,032
in Utopia.

253
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,999
In the real world they're an excuse to drink
excessively and say things you shouldn't.

254
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,868
- A philosopher, huh?
- Well, shrink.

255
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,996
- Crikey!
- What?

256
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,957
- No, nothing.
- No, tell me.

257
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,836
Well, you Yanks and your therapy,

258
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:15,037
it's a load of touchy-feely mumbo jumbo.

259
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:19,157
Spilling your guts to a total stranger,
it's not natural.

260
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,471
Oh, God.

261
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,440
It's just...

262
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:32,070
There's this girl that I care for...
Well, I suppose you could say I love her.

263
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,432
The bugger is,
she's here with some other guy.

264
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,192
There you are.

265
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,755
Hey, Kat. Hey, Kat.

266
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,274
Oh, hey, yourself. I see you met my ex.

267
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,914
- I was just telling him how we met.
- Mm.

268
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,831
- The Knicks game.
- Oh, yes.

269
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,632
Yeah... Oh.

270
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,400
You hate sport.

271
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,630
- I hate cricket.
- Right, yes.

272
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,079
Well, I should go and... go.

273
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,237
He looks miserable.

274
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,390
- What were you talking about?
- He seems a little drunk

275
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,074
but I think he's still crazy about you.

276
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,594
- Do I know you from somewhere?
- No.

277
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,151
What did he say? You don't...

278
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,437
You don't think he wants me back?

279
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,151
"Love started making sense

280
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,994
"I always make mistakes at my expense

281
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:36,914
"Love has placed a seed

282
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,675
"And you're the sun
that shines down upon me

283
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:44,548
"Yeah, when we are together

284
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,232
"And when we are apart"

285
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,470
Are you OK?

286
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,868
- Here we are.
- Thank God!

287
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,912
- Oh!
- Thanks, Mom.

288
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,600
- There you are, darling.
- Thanks, Dad.

289
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,511
God!

290
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:08,550
- Thanks again for having me.
- Don't be silly. It's wonderful to meet you.

291
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,189
Although technically,
I never knew you existed.

292
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,272
- Come on, Bunny.
- I love surprises.

293
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,150
Where's Nick sleeping?

294
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,711
My mother has this rule about sharing
when there's no ring involved...

295
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,035
- Don't be silly.
- What?

296
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,999
I am not as small-town
as my daughter seems to think.

297
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,199
Sorry about this.

298
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,397
I went through a painfully
earnest floral phase.

299
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,511
Air Supply?

300
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,829
Oh. My parents had a German
exchange student a few years back.

301
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,837
He must have left it here.

302
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,232
Everyone knows their greatest hits.

303
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,517
Some of their lesser-known ballads
are surprisingly poignant.

304
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:36,709
Is that an old habit from ballet class
or from a lifetime of walking on eggshells?

305
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,159
I never took ballet.

306
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,633
How'd you know that was me?

307
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,637
I have a friend at the magazine.

308
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,671
So much for anonymity.

309
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,479
Go ahead, take a look.
It's part of the package.

310
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,268
I'm sorry, I'm just a little nervous.

311
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,033
I never thought anything like this
could happen to me.

312
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,997
This happened to you?

313
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,669
It happened in the sense that
I picked up the phone, tracked you down,

314
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,593
flew you over her and gave you $6,000.

315
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,836
- Will you grab my shampoo, please?
- Shampoo! Got it.

316
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:48,670
"I'm all out love,
I'm so lost without you

317
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:52,753
"I know you were right,
believing for so long

318
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:57,914
"I'm all out of love,
what am I without you?

319
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,996
"I can't be too late
to say that I was so wrong"

320
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:11,759
The part where you were
a sexual surrogate and then started to...

321
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,597
branch out, is...

322
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:18,233
Is that really how it happened?

323
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:22,313
The real story -
my mother was a hippie, and a stripper.

324
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,310
She was insanely inappropriate with me,

325
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,676
she washed her lingerie
in my bath water while I was still in it.

326
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,239
Oh.

327
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,108
So as an adult, I needed to find ways
to experience intimacy and sex

328
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,033
- but with rules that couldn't be violated.
- Wow.

329
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,071
I'm just screwing with you.

330
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,431
You shit.

331
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,117
OK, this part.

332
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,475
You say, and I quote,

333
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53,552
"Every woman has
the exact love life she wants."

334
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,870
That seems a broad generalization... Oh!

335
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,873
Oh.

336
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:13,396
Do you honestly believe that
I want to be single and miserable?

337
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:17,473
Do you think that I want to be hung up
on some guy who led me on for years

338
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:20,279
and out of the blue shattered my heart?

339
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:24,194
First of all, there's no such thing
as out of the blue.

340
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,510
And second of all, yeah.

341
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,068
- What?
- When you're ready to let go,

342
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,754
to be un-single and un-miserable,

343
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,193
you will.

344
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,918
Till then...

345
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,438
So when you were talking to Jeffrey before,

346
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,351
how did he sound?

347
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,680
Like a harmless, self-absorbed toolbox.

348
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,636
Seriously.

349
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,510
He sounded tormented.

350
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,797
Tormented? How?

351
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,839
Like he's...

352
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,118
jealous that I'm here
with someone else, or like...

353
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,637
he regrets throwing away
our life together?

354
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,991
It's just that...

355
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,833
this hasn't really turned out
the way that I thought it would.

356
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,911
Hey, Nick.

357
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,273
Oh-oh-oh!

358
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,631
He seems more mature.

359
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,438
Run, you fat tart! Come on.

360
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:57,310
"Shoo be do be do be do be do wop wop,
shoo be do be do be do be do wop wop"

361
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,152
Come on, throw it. Throw it!

362
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:04,035
"You'll look at me,
and even though I know..."

363
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,156
- Well played, darling.
- Ed!

364
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,514
What?

365
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,749
"One fine day..."

366
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,115
- Are you ready, TJ?
- Bugger off.

367
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,239
"You're gonna want me for your girl
"Shoo be do be do be do be do wop wop

368
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,351
"Oh, yeah"

369
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,311
All right, batter, batter.

370
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,274
"The arms I long for will open wide
"Shoo be do be do be do be do wop wop

371
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,789
"And you'll be proud to have me
"Shoo be do be do be do be do wop wop

372
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,553
"Right by your side
"Shoo be do be do be do be do wop wop

373
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,995
"One fine day

374
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:35,039
"You're gonna want me for your girl
"Shoo be do be do be do be do wop wop"

375
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,872
- Move back.
- Yeah.

376
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:42,755
"Though I know you're the kind of boy..."

377
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,909
Come on, Kat.

378
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,310
- "Who only wants to run around"
- Batter up.

379
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,590
- You're up, Kat.
- "I'll be waiting..."

380
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,272
Go, Kat.

381
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:56,075
"Someday, darling, you'll come to me

382
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:59,516
"When you want to settle down, oh!"

383
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,477
Be nice to me, Jeffrey.

384
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:06,120
"One fine day, we'll meet once more
"Shoo be do be do be do be do wop wop"

385
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,872
- Out!
- Yes!

386
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,029
"One fine day..."

387
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,437
Lose the game.

388
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,718
"You're gonna want me for your girl"

389
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,712
No!

390
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,399
- Come on!
- Edward.

391
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,798
Come on!

392
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,474
Come on, you sexy little monkey. Come on!

393
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:41,318
- You're supposed to be helping.
- Oh, trust me. I am.

394
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,119
"One fine day, oh yeah
"One fine day

395
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,714
"You're gonna want me for your girl
"One fine day

396
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,997
"One fine day
"Oh yeah

397
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,752
"One fine day"

398
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,710
What's with the socks?
It's a golf-themed bachelorette.

399
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,711
Have you ever done a wedding before?

400
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,631
No, but I have done funerals.

401
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,234
An escort at a funeral? Someone's dead.

402
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,550
Yeah, imagine facing that alone.

403
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,710
Ah. Catch.

404
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,794
Make sure he stays on
the right side of the road.

405
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,110
- Which is, of course, the left.
- That's right.

406
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,231
So, are you ever attracted
to your clients?

407
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:40,750
I know you're curious about my business
but I really can't discuss other clients.

408
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:44,196
Come on! How many of them
want to sleep with you?

409
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:49,033
You know, I swear it's not about the sex.

410
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,880
It's about understanding what people need.

411
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,997
Please! You're like the Yoda of escorts.

412
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:59,070
Getting you on the phone
was harder than getting into college.

413
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,192
- No, I don't play games. No gimmicks.
- Mm-hm.

414
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,111
It's much more...

415
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,119
Subtle?

416
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,280
It's not about me.

417
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,237
It's about you.

418
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,759
Show me.

419
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,473
Come on.

420
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,953
Hmm... What's holding me back?

421
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:30,197
I think it's the words "morally repugnant".

422
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,438
Show me.

423
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,478
Close your eyes.

424
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,313
Close your eyes.

425
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,077
Close your eyes.

426
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,080
You're safe, you can relax.

427
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,191
I'm not gonna kiss you.

428
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,829
He's gonna be so sorry he lost you.

429
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,633
So, stop worrying.

430
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,077
Forget the past.

431
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,512
Forget the pain.

432
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,277
And remember...

433
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,034
what an incredible woman you are.

434
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,356
If you do that,

435
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,277
he'll realize what he lost.

436
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,829
Holy crap!

437
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,399
You're worth every penny.

438
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,517
- You should get going.
- Mm-hm.

439
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,077
OK, Yoda.

440
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,151
To Amy!

441
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:20,952
"Girl, to be with you is my favorite thing"

442
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,516
I thought you might need this.

443
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,311
Silly me. Where was my head?

444
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,270
- Bye.
- Listen, why don't you stay

445
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,749
- and have a little fiery drink with us, eh?
- Uh...

446
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,711
- It's fine.
- Come on.

447
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,671
You know you want to!

448
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,040
- Oh, I can see why.
- You're lovely.

449
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,792
Isn't he lovely? Have you smelt him?

450
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,757
He smells lovely!

451
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,638
Can you believe Kat gets to shag this guy?

452
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:53,271
No, really, you should send God
a bottle of wine or a quiche or something.

453
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,073
Look at those buns. Fresh from the bakery.

454
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,952
It must feel great getting paid
just for being you.

455
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,190
- Who says I'm being me?
- Excuse me.

456
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,552
Amy, thank you for granting me
a rare glimpse into a timeless female ritual.

457
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,950
Here's to the husbands who've won you,
the losers who've lost you

458
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:19,430
and the lucky bastards
who've yet to meet you.

459
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,474
And to the cock in the henhouse.

460
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:56,240
I can't believe you found him first.
I am so depressed.

461
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,869
Will somebody buy my hoo-hah a drink?

462
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,557
You remember when we took
the girls hiking in the Lake District?

463
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,039
- No.
- You do!

464
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,953
Blistering heat in the morning,
rained all afternoon.

465
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,155
No.

466
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:15,158
You backed your car
over a copper's bicycle.

467
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,840
- Sorry, no.
- The Rat And Gherkin.

468
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,190
- Splendid local scrumpy.
- Mm.

469
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,311
Amy wore that little bikini thing.

470
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,153
But somehow it was Kat
that got stung by nettles.

471
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:28,312
Kat never said a word until
Amy caught her scratching her arse.

472
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:32,678
Then you rubbed it with a dock leaf
to bring down the swelling.

473
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,596
Yeah, I remember it.

474
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,111
I didn't deserve her back then.

475
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,718
And you do now?

476
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,477
What is his problem?

477
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:56,392
- What?
- There's something about him I don't like.

478
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,711
He's less than 90 per cent body fat
and he's shagging your ex.

479
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,760
No, that is not it. Look at him,

480
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,469
he's walking around all American,
like he owns the place.

481
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,355
Oh, no!

482
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,716
Come on, this is your last chance.

483
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,359
Woody?

484
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:47,029
- Not yet, but it's getting there!
- It's getting there!

485
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,238
Oh, my God! What are you doing here?

486
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,639
I thought you were in San Francisco,
or was it Nepal?

487
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,871
Close. Sydney.
But it turns out that I missed the rain.

488
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:05,192
Did Kat tell you that she dumped you because
of your funky breath?

489
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,078
She's drunk.

490
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,789
But I didn't... I didn't really dump you. Right?

491
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:17,635
Hard. But it was understandable,
you were one of the hottest girls in school.

492
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:21,508
And we know that Kat was
one of the hottest expats in school

493
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:25,394
because she was voted
Best Eyes and Brightest Smile

494
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,114
and the Most Likely To Age Well.

495
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,359
You're my half-sister but I whole love you.

496
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,955
How about you get
my half-sister a Seventh Hole?

497
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,274
- Tequila. Tequila.
- Sure.

498
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,793
Are you all right?

499
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,836
I don't know if I can do this.

500
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,152
The Seventh Hole?

501
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,595
No! The wedding.

502
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,439
I shouldn't be allowed to get married.
I shouldn't.

503
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,156
What are you talking about?

504
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,238
TJ!

505
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,556
Come on! Come on!

506
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:33,829
What's wrong with Jeffrey?
As if I would sleep with a stripper!

507
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,679
I'm about to get married. You have to...

508
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:43,956
It's been my experience that
a man in love doesn't want a prostitute.

509
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,830
Eddie, you did the right thing.

510
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,717
How do you know so much...

511
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,197
about so much?

512
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,637
I'm a hooker.

513
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,511
I like that.

514
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,234
"Baby!

515
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:31,999
"Sometimes I'm down

516
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,115
"I'm level, level with the ground

517
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,032
"Whoa

518
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,834
"Baby, you treat me

519
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,477
"Bad...

520
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,270
"No, I know

521
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:50,040
"Know you don't mean it now

522
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,595
"I just don't know when to say bye-bye

523
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,311
"Yeah

524
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,628
"Uh

525
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,356
"Uh, uh

526
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,198
"Uh, uh, whoa!

527
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,358
"Baby

528
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,596
"I've got that feeling, baby..."

529
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:11,116
I just don't feel very well.
I'm gonna go. Give us a kiss.

530
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,034
- Ladies...
- How much do you rock, TJ?

531
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,793
...that was a top night.

532
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,552
Top night!

533
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,196
She's getting married!

534
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,596
"I'm all out of love

535
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,796
"I'm so lost without you

536
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,711
"I know you were right

537
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,030
"Believing for so long

538
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,031
"I'm all out of love

539
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,315
"What am I without you?

540
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,391
"I can't be too late

541
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,471
"I know I was so wrong

542
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,790
"I'm all out of love

543
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,836
"What am I without you?

544
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,638
"I can't be too late

545
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:08,356
"To say that I was so wrong..."

546
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,912
Are you OK?

547
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,872
Ooh! Ow!

548
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:27,634
"Watch the sun rise

549
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,631
"Say your goodbyes

550
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:32,234
"Off we go

"No contemplation

"Hit the road

"Car overheats

00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:04,313
"But I want you so bad

00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:08,357
"Everyone has a secret

00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:11,591
"Oh, can they keep it?

561
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:16,435
"Oh, no, they can't"

562
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,436
- Morning.
- Morning.

563
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,717
Ahoy, there!

564
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:51,319
Hi, Dad.

565
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:23,388
I don't know what works for you
but I brought you some black coffee

566
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:27,109
and some stale crackers, egg and cheese
sandwich and a Bloody Mary.

567
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:30,875
That's very sweet of you.
But I need to ask you something.

568
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,631
What happened last night?

569
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,239
Nothing.

570
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:00,798
Thanks.

571
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:19,270
- Is this for last night?
- No! How could it be? Nothing happened.

572
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:22,432
If I was gonna charge you,
I said I'd tell you first.

573
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:27,548
I didn't want you to think that
I was expecting anything for free

574
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:30,353
or that I was expecting anything at all.

575
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:33,034
I mean, obviously
I was expecting something

576
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:36,192
or else I wouldn't have stopped at that ATM.

577
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:38,510
Just so you know, you're 300 short.

578
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,800
Wait, you're telling me that
if something happened last night,

579
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,279
I'd have to pay you $1,700?

580
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:50,476
That's a down payment on a Ford Focus.

581
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,232
Not dollars, pounds.

582
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,993
Besides, it includes, you know...

583
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:57,031
That's the extra 300.

584
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:02,595
Are you a boatsman, son?

585
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:05,069
I am now, sir.

586
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:07,799
I'm glad someone's
making use of her at last.

587
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:09,950
The boat, I mean.

588
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:13,550
"To defile." Four letters.

589
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,517
- Good morning, Daddy.
- Ah.

590
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:23,158
- What if I didn't want you to do that to me?
- The 300's for you doing it to me.

591
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:26,869
If anything had happened, it would have
been one of the highlights, for you.

592
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,709
- But nothing did.
- That's why you get to keep your money.

593
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:33,277
The wedding dance is

594
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:37,478
the most important dance moment
in a person's life.

595
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:41,673
A room full of friends and family,

596
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:44,794
watching, smiling,

597
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,348
betting on how long the marriage will last.

598
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,994
All you'll have is each other

599
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:53,913
and whatever skills you acquire today.

600
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,352
And pair off.

601
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:06,555
- "When marimba rhythms start to play..." -
Breathe. Good, that's a nice position.

602
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,915
Now, your left foot. Her right foot.

603
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,832
Good. And we'll try to glide across the floor.

604
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:16,556
Come a little bit closer together. Moving.

605
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,435
Trying to turn.

606
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,590
What's the matter, Nick?

607
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,318
Two left feet?

608
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:26,159
Oh!

609
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:31,595
"Stay with me, sway with me

610
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:35,790
"Other dancers may be on the floor

611
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,469
"Dear, but my eyes will see only you

612
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:43,189
"Only you have that magic technique

613
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:46,750
"When we sway I go weak

614
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:50,196
"I can hear the sound of violins

615
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:53,989
"Long before it begins

616
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:57,356
"Make me thrill as only you know how

617
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:01,600
"Sway me smooth, sway me now

618
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:04,239
"Like a flower bending in the breeze

619
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:08,478
"Bend with me, sway with ease

620
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:12,036
"When we dance you have a way with me

621
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:16,073
"Stay with me, sway with me

622
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,833
"Like a flower bending in the breeze

623
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:23,357
"Bend with me, sway with ease

624
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:27,479
"When we dance you have a way with me"

625
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:31,998
When I told you
I'd never done a wedding before,

626
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:34,958
it wasn't because I'd never been asked.

627
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,551
I'd just never said yes.

628
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:41,919
Why'd you say yes to me?

629
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:46,792
There was something in your voice
on the phone that day.

630
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:51,037
Desperation?

631
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:54,397
I think it was hope.

632
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:57,677
Get a move on, you lovebirds.
I'm getting married in the morning.

633
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:29,035
- Ah, hello, Bambi.
- Darling, please don't do that.

634
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:37,677
Oh, wow.

635
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:41,151
That's a big bed.

636
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:58,310
You know what pisses me off?

637
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:03,235
I've been spilling my guts all weekend
and I don't know anything about you.

638
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,595
I'm allergic to fabric softener.

639
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:11,672
I'm majoring in comparative literature
at Brown. I hate anchovies.

640
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:16,318
I think I'd miss you
even if we'd never met.

641
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:25,437
Come on!

642
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:34,069
I'm a little concerned...
I'm just... It makes me nervous...

643
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:37,357
You know, I might just call you.

644
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:41,953
But if I did, I would lose,
because my hand is complete shite.

645
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,519
Ohhh.

646
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:46,754
- I'm in.
- Come on.

647
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:49,070
There's gotta be something wrong with him.

648
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:52,277
I bet his thingy bends, doesn't it?
Got a little kink in it.

649
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:55,272
Oh, no, don't tell me.
It's bloody perfect.

650
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:58,589
I'm going to see you.

651
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,710
Looky, looky here.

652
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,080
A full house.

653
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:07,116
Oh-ho-ho!

654
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:10,988
Has anyone seen my future wife?
She'll kill me if I don't serve her first.

655
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:14,356
Have you guys ever had
a real honest-to-God fight, ever?

656
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:16,874
- Yes, of course.
- Yeah, right.

657
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,879
Well, apparently,
makeup sex is the best kind.

658
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,831
Not that I'm ever going to find out.

659
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:25,388
Give me that!

660
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:27,516
- Come on!
- No, no!

661
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,477
- Don't!
- Come on!

662
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,468
You seem to have a way with women.

663
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:40,471
Why don't you go and rustle up the bride? Get
her to join the party.

664
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:47,836
Why are you bringing this up now?
I love Ed.

665
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:50,918
- What do you want from me?
- I want you to tell me...

666
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:58,196
Blue shirt or... white shirt
for the, er, rehearsal dinner?

667
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,112
Sorry to interrupt.

668
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,634
Your dad sent me.

669
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,597
What for?

670
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,556
To make sure you're OK.

671
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:21,434
Kat, could I have a word?
lt'll only take a moment.

672
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:25,599
Let me think. You stole seven years of
her life with your bullshit and your charm

673
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,432
and now you'd like just a moment?

674
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:30,080
Sure. Go right ahead.

675
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:37,959
Thanks for the solidarity, Mum,
but next time a little less information.

676
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:41,835
Do you believe a place has a memory?

677
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:47,517
Even before Ed and I started dating,
we all used to come up here in the summer

678
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,477
and spend weekends.

679
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:01,114
God, I hope it doesn't remember everything.

680
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:05,600
No matter how certain
one is of one's position

681
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:07,716
of what one should or shouldn't do,

682
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:09,870
one sometimes discovers

683
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:14,351
that one is not as one would have
hoped one would have been.

684
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:18,237
- What exactly are you trying to say?
- I'm sorry.

685
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:21,835
Look, I feel like I need to tell you something.

686
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:25,230
- You're not even listening.
- I'm sorry. I'll be back in a minute.

687
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,878
Hey, is everything OK?

688
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:40,237
Yeah.

689
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:43,878
Yeah.

690
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:50,751
Anchovy, Nick?

691
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:52,910
I remember the day I met Kat.

692
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,877
It was in New York.

693
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,030
I'd been seeing Bunny for a few months

694
00:53:57,160 --> 00:54:01,551
and she finally trusted me
enough to meet her kid.

695
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:07,590
So I'm over at her place
and in walks this little monster.

696
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:11,315
That was it. I was a goner.

697
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:14,397
That was the day I became a dad.

698
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:19,753
You know, Nick, you think it's going
to get easier as they get older,

699
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:22,638
that you're going to worry about them less.

700
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:27,270
Or that you're going to trust the world more.

701
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:30,111
But that's just not how it happens.

702
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:44,552
This may not make much sense to you, sir,

703
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:48,235
but I'd like to ask your permission
to date your daughter.

704
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:52,717
I thought you already were.

705
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:12,594
- I blame... I blame Tony Peepants.
- No.

706
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:14,318
Let's have the story. Kat, come on.

707
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:17,915
- No.
- I have to initiate Nick into our family.

708
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:23,711
I blame Tony for why my two girls
just don't seem to be able to get along.

709
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:27,636
Don't deny it. You barely tolerate each other.

710
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:31,918
Come on. It's true. The only thing you've got in
common is you're both attracted to me.

711
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:33,678
It started after we moved here.

712
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:38,430
My two girls got into a fight over Tony
Peepants and have never made up since.

713
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:40,835
Apparently, Kat and I were inseparable.

714
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:43,275
If Kat ate a banana, Amy threw it up.

715
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:45,316
If Amy threw it up, Kat ate it.

716
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:51,151
So we were eating
and throwing up together in harmony

717
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:53,435
until Tony walked me home
from school one day.

718
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:54,919
He was my first boyfriend.

719
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,833
Tony ignored Kat
because he wanted to play with me.

720
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:01,913
Anyway, the point of the story is that
Tony ended up with a chair in his face.

721
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,992
It was plastic and child-sized.

722
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:11,114
- As I recall, there were stitches involved.
- Come on, Bunny, 15 stitches.

723
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:13,629
So is that when he peed in his pants?

724
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:15,870
He cried a lot,
but there was no peeing.

725
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:19,032
So what's with the nickname?

726
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,190
I have absolutely no idea.

727
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:29,917
Let me get some more wine.

728
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:32,751
Would you marry me if I asked?

729
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:35,070
That was a yes. Did you see that?

730
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:49,633
And you know, I thought perhaps you...
Bollocks. Sorry.

731
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:54,911
I had no idea this would be so difficult.
I just feel like I owe you an explanation.

732
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,355
Relax, relax. It's fine.

733
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:00,157
I promise.

734
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:06,679
And I should probably admit that...

735
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:12,275
I brought Nick with me to torture you, slowly,

736
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:14,191
for the entire weekend.

737
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:19,318
But then, I don't know,
something happened and now...

738
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:23,837
I hope this doesn't hurt your feelings
but I'm just sick of you and me.

739
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:30,272
Of our whole story, so come on,
let's just go upstairs and eat some tiramisu.

740
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:35,949
I slept with your sister.

741
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:49,552
- I'm sorry?
- Well, I shagged Amy, two years ago.

742
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:52,313
That's why I broke it off with you.

743
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:57,554
And then after you left,
sod it, we kept at it like rabbits,

744
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:02,555
until we both realized it was absolutely mad
and, obviously, morally wrong.

745
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,798
And then that was it.

746
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:12,908
But last Christmas, when Ed proposed,

747
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,549
I realized... l'm in love with her.

748
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:24,714
Good Lord, say something, please.

749
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:42,355
Oh, my God, he's told you, hasn't he?

750
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:46,590
- You knew?
- Kat, I'm so sorry. I'm so...

751
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:58,510
Kat. Kat, please.

752
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:00,795
Kat, please don't say anything.

753
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:06,873
I can't believe you told her.

754
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:40,000
What's going on?

755
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,877
Nothing.

756
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:45,398
It doesn't look like nothing.

757
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:48,715
Now is not the time to catch on, Ed.

758
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:53,839
OK. Good.

759
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:09,158
Leave me alone.
You knew and you didn't tell me.

760
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:12,471
- Wait up.
- I can't believe I trusted you.

761
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:14,640
Come on. You've got to stop running.

762
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:18,110
- How could you not have told me?
- What did you expect me to say?

763
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:21,395
You let me make a fool of myself.

764
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:26,071
You lied to me, but I guess I shouldn't be
surprised because that's what you do.

765
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:28,196
That's who you are. You're a liar.

766
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:31,675
You're judging me? That's a good one.

767
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:34,280
You're going to point a finger at me,

768
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:38,068
the guy that you hired
to pretend to be your boyfriend?

769
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:42,472
You're right. I was so desperate
to make everyone believe that I was happy

770
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:45,028
that I paid $6,000 for a lie.

771
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:49,716
And, at the end of the day, the only one
who ended up falling for it was me.

772
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,631
I wish I could say it was worth it.

773
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:56,515
Go ahead, Kat, hate me.

774
01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:01,269
I think you're running out of steam
on this whole Jeffrey thing anyhow.

775
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:06,229
Maybe now you'll be able to hold on to this
long enough to ruin your next relationship.

776
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:23,110
- Nick.
- I'm just checking into a hotel.

777
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:25,515
Don't be ridiculous. It's late.

778
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:28,391
Take the car.

779
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:38,152
Actually, the boathouse is empty.

780
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:43,632
Look, I don't know what's going on with
you two but I'm sure you'll work it out.

781
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:52,315
You couldn't be more perfect
if she'd picked you out of a catalog.

782
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:59,151
Thanks, Ed.

783
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:10,593
Hey.

784
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:15,279
Hey.

785
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:23,998
I just... I wanted to say thank you
for not outing me in front of Ed.

786
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:31,032
I want to tell him,
just not the night before our wedding.

787
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:34,317
You know, with these things,
timing is everything.

788
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,877
You're right.

789
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:47,598
You should time it right,

790
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:52,596
so that when he hears that
you repeatedly screwed his best friend,

791
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:55,831
he won't feel like the world is collapsing
and there's no escape

792
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:58,992
because you tricked him into marrying you.

793
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,798
- Kat...
- Don't worry. Your wedding will be perfect.

794
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:13,749
Tomorrow I'll say all the right things
and you'll deal with Ed when you're ready.

795
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:18,436
But right now, tonight,
I'm not going to pretend it's OK.

796
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:34,235
And that's your first flight out?

797
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:36,356
"Another summer day
has come and gone away"

798
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:38,914
- All right, thanks.

01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:11,471
I don't believe you.

809
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:14,476
I'm fine, really.

810
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:20,799
Nothing a bottle of Jack
and a straight razor couldn't fix.

811
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:26,637
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

812
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:28,676
It's Amy's day.

813
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:47,677
Get in the car, darling.

814
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:58,157
No, no. Smile.

815
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:24,232
Hello.

816
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:28,837
I've been looking for you.

817
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:36,155
So, why did you let him go?

818
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:44,349
- It's complicated, Dad.
- Right.

819
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:47,233
It probably wouldn't have
worked out anyway, huh?

820
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:56,636
I remember reading a fascinating article
in the New York Times Magazine once,

821
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:58,950
where this guy said,

822
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:03,431
"Every woman has
the exact love life she wants."

823
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,389
You know what? I agree with him.

824
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:12,116
But I refuse to believe
that this is what you want, Kat.

825
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:15,236
Ever since you were little,

826
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:18,710
you've always worried
about what other people think.

827
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:24,356
Now, come on. What do you think?
Is he the guy for you?

828
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:32,479
Then go and get him.

829
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:03,037
Hello, darling. Your mother said
you wanted to have a quick word.

830
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:04,997
No, no, no, I...

831
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:12,751
There's something
you should know before you marry me.

832
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:13,989
What is it?

833
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:05,598
I wanted to tell you
but I was afraid you'd never forgive me

834
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:07,955
and I just... I love you so much.

835
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:10,910
I'm sorry.

836
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:16,757
I knew you were seeing someone else
when we finally got together, but not Jeffrey.

837
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:21,155
Does Kat know?

838
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:24,431
Jeffrey told her last night.

839
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:31,352
Excuse me.

840
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:40,752
Ed?

841
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:47,673
Ed... Calm down, Ed.

842
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:49,159
Ed!

843
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:52,429
TJ!

844
01:08:58,320 --> 01:09:00,151
Ah!

845
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:08,073
Ed, calm down!
It's all sorted! She wants you!

846
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:10,549
I've given up! What's the problem?

847
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:12,710
You back-stabbing weasel!

848
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:16,315
That's not fair.
It was before you guys were even dating.

849
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:19,517
But you were engaged to her sister.

850
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:22,114
Ed, calm down!

851
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:26,676
We can talk about this
like civilized human beings.

852
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:35,829
I look like a total wanker, don't I?

853
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:37,319
Yeah, kind of.

854
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:47,478
Get in the car, Ed.
He's halfway to France by now.

855
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:49,670
Whoa!

856
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:02,389
I trust you've enjoyed
your trip to England.

857
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:05,119
Yeah, it was fantastic.
Thanks, Eddie.

858
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:10,433
You know, I felt sorry
for you last night.

859
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:16,150
I was just sitting there like some smug arse,
thinking, "Aren't I a lucky sod?"

860
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:23,279
I forgave her when I thought
it was just some random bloke.

861
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:27,197
But not Jeffrey.

862
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:32,954
I've had her up on a pedestal ever since...

863
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:39,035
ever since I put her up there.

864
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:42,876
What a mess I've made, huh?

865
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:56,597
I'm so sorry.

866
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:05,436
The hardest thing's loving someone

867
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:08,472
and then having the courage
to let them love you back.

868
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:17,835
But if you know her shit
and she knows yours

869
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:21,993
and at the end of the day,
you still would rather give up than try...

870
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:27,710
nothing's ever gonna be worth it.

871
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:36,679
Maybe think about it this way.

872
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:39,069
You go back,

873
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:42,715
you get to spend the rest of your life
having really great makeup sex.

874
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:48,950
- Ed?
- Must run!

875
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:51,758
Hi.

876
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:55,439
Hi.

877
01:11:57,680 --> 01:12:02,196
Last night, when we were fighting,
I thought this was over.

878
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:08,995
And I was going to leave you alone
and just take off but...

879
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:17,549
Then I realized I'd rather fight with you
than make love with anyone else.

880
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:50,120
- I should get going.
- What? No, you can't.

881
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:51,997
I have to.

882
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:53,957
I'm the best man.

883
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:14,074
"You can dance every dance
