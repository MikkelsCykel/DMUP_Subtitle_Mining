00:00:32,831 --> 00:00:36,844
It's like this. A dead plaintiff
is rarely worth as much

2
00:00:36,885 --> 00:00:39,338
as a living,
severely maimed plaintiff.

3
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:42,249
However, if it's a long,
agonising death,

4
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:44,960
as opposed to a quick drowning
or car wreck,

5
00:00:45,002 --> 00:00:47,304
the value can rise considerably.

6
00:00:47,446 --> 00:00:51,725
A dead adult in his 20s is worth less
than a middle-aged one,

7
00:00:51,967 --> 00:00:54,194
a dead woman less than a dead man,

8
00:00:54,236 --> 00:00:57,022
single adults less than married,

9
00:00:57,064 --> 00:01:00,409
black less than white,
poor less than rich.

10
00:01:01,051 --> 00:01:03,796
But the perfect victim
is a white, male, professional -

11
00:01:04,138 --> 00:01:06,224
40 years old, at the height
of his earning power,

12
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:09,494
struck down in his prime.

13
00:01:10,335 --> 00:01:12,580
And the most imperfect?

14
00:01:12,721 --> 00:01:15,450
Well, in the calculus
of personal injury law,

15
00:01:15,491 --> 00:01:18,761
a dead child is worth least of all.

16
00:01:22,798 --> 00:01:24,424
A million dollars he turns down.

17
00:01:24,466 --> 00:01:28,178
- One million dollars!
- I don't believe their story.

18
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:30,556
- It's true.
- Come on!

19
00:01:30,597 --> 00:01:33,100
- Hey, Eddie. How you doing?
- Good.

20
00:01:33,141 --> 00:01:35,602
Do me a favour - shut the fuck up.

21
00:01:35,644 --> 00:01:39,731
Our banker there doesn't know
Jan refused a million.

22
00:01:39,773 --> 00:01:41,942
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

23
00:01:45,112 --> 00:01:46,989
Asshole.

24
00:02:09,469 --> 00:02:12,389
How's your head? Up?

25
00:02:16,143 --> 00:02:20,063
How's that? OK?
Are you comfortable?

26
00:02:21,398 --> 00:02:23,692
Open?

27
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,244
Here we go.

28
00:02:43,128 --> 00:02:45,214
All rise.

29
00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:49,176
This court is now in session.

30
00:02:49,259 --> 00:02:53,096
The Honourable
Constance Mullen presiding.

31
00:02:53,138 --> 00:02:55,182
Would you like some water?

32
00:02:55,641 --> 00:02:58,393
Carney versus Massachusetts
General Hospital -

33
00:02:58,477 --> 00:03:01,188
case number 812725.

34
00:03:03,815 --> 00:03:06,610
Attorneys,
please state your appearance.

35
00:03:06,693 --> 00:03:08,570
Randolph Woodside, Mass General.

36
00:03:09,655 --> 00:03:11,865
Greg Monk,
Massachusetts General Hospital.

37
00:03:12,783 --> 00:03:14,409
Harold Peshniak, Mass General.

38
00:03:15,494 --> 00:03:17,246
Jan Schlichtmann for Paul Carney.

39
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:20,916
Kevin Conway for Mr Carney,
Your Honour.

40
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:24,253
Mr Schlichtmann, we're ready
for your opening statement.

41
00:03:48,235 --> 00:03:51,321
Your Honour,
if it please the court,

42
00:03:51,405 --> 00:03:54,408
the parties involved
have agreed to a settlement.

43
00:05:05,437 --> 00:05:08,190
Personal injury law
has a bad reputation.

44
00:05:08,273 --> 00:05:11,026
They call us ambulance chasers,
bottom feeders,

45
00:05:11,109 --> 00:05:14,071
vultures preying on
the misfortunes of others.

46
00:05:14,112 --> 00:05:18,367
If that's true, why do I lie awake
worrying about my clients?

47
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:21,286
Why is their pain my pain?

48
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:26,500
I wish I didn't empathise.
It'd be a lot easier.

49
00:05:47,938 --> 00:05:50,816
We're speaking to Jan Schlichtmann,
personal injury attorney

50
00:05:50,899 --> 00:05:53,944
and according to Boston magazine -
have you seen this? -

51
00:05:54,027 --> 00:05:57,281
one of Boston's
ten most eligible bachelors.

52
00:06:10,711 --> 00:06:13,338
Let's go back to the phones. Woburn,
you're on the air.

53
00:06:16,049 --> 00:06:17,551
Mr Schlichtmann,
it's Anne Anderson.

54
00:06:17,634 --> 00:06:19,636
- Hello.
- How are you?

55
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,264
Very well. You? Sounds pretty.

56
00:06:23,348 --> 00:06:25,392
How come you never call me?

57
00:06:25,475 --> 00:06:29,104
- If I had your number, I would.
- You have it.

58
00:06:29,187 --> 00:06:32,941
- I do?
- You have no idea who I am?

59
00:06:33,066 --> 00:06:35,611
- Is this Ricky?
- No.

60
00:06:35,694 --> 00:06:38,989
You see, my son died of leukaemia
two years ago.

61
00:06:39,072 --> 00:06:42,200
- Your firm is handling the case.
- We are?

62
00:06:42,284 --> 00:06:45,120
The reason I'm calling you here

63
00:06:45,203 --> 00:06:50,250
is because my calls to your offices
have gone unreturned for weeks.

64
00:06:50,334 --> 00:06:52,628
- Sorry, your name was?
- Anne.

65
00:06:52,753 --> 00:06:54,880
- Anne...
- Anderson.

66
00:06:54,922 --> 00:06:59,426
I'm writing that down.
I'm gonna take care of this.

67
00:07:01,803 --> 00:07:03,597
Why don't you come up to Woburn

68
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,393
and actually meet a few of those
people whose pain is your pain?

69
00:07:11,647 --> 00:07:13,357
Let me picture this.

70
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,444
She called you, she cried.
You felt sorry and you cried.

71
00:07:17,527 --> 00:07:20,864
- Now she's mad.
- It's a good case.

72
00:07:20,948 --> 00:07:24,326
- She's not crying now!
- An orphan, but good.

73
00:07:24,409 --> 00:07:28,247
12 deaths over 15 years from
leukaemia - eight of them children.

74
00:07:28,372 --> 00:07:31,959
- That's unusual?
- Statistically. It's a small town.

75
00:07:32,042 --> 00:07:33,502
She lost a child?

76
00:07:34,628 --> 00:07:38,090
They think it's something to do
with the city's drinking water

77
00:07:38,173 --> 00:07:40,050
which they say tastes funny.

78
00:07:40,133 --> 00:07:42,219
What was she like before?

79
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:46,014
- Do want to hear what it's about?
- No, I don't!

80
00:07:46,056 --> 00:07:48,559
I'd like to hear about it.

81
00:07:50,811 --> 00:07:53,146
Thank you, Kathy.

82
00:07:53,188 --> 00:07:55,899
There's a report here
from state inspectors

83
00:07:55,983 --> 00:07:59,027
saying that the water
from two city wells

84
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:02,531
is contaminated - or was
before they shut them down -

85
00:08:02,656 --> 00:08:05,951
with something called...
I can't pronounce this...

86
00:08:06,034 --> 00:08:08,161
trichlorethylene...ethylene,

87
00:08:08,245 --> 00:08:10,789
which the EPA lists
as a probable carcinogen.

88
00:08:10,914 --> 00:08:12,749
- Stop.
- There's more.

89
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:18,046
No, from a financial standpoint,
this is not a sound investment.

90
00:08:18,171 --> 00:08:20,465
Probable is a euphemism
for unproven.

91
00:08:20,591 --> 00:08:24,011
To prove something like this,
you need new medical research.

92
00:08:24,094 --> 00:08:26,471
Is that our business -
medical research?

93
00:08:26,555 --> 00:08:31,018
And...and ask yourself,
why is this an orphan?

94
00:08:31,101 --> 00:08:34,521
It's been kicked around
before ending up on your desk.

95
00:08:34,605 --> 00:08:37,316
Gordon's right.

96
00:08:37,357 --> 00:08:41,153
I can appreciate
the theatrical value of dead kids.

97
00:08:41,194 --> 00:08:45,991
That's good. But that's all it has
going for it, and it's not enough.

98
00:08:47,117 --> 00:08:49,161
I'll get rid of it.

99
00:08:50,495 --> 00:08:53,832
I'll...just go up there and...

100
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:58,253
You'll both start to cry again,
she'll be mad at me.

101
00:08:58,337 --> 00:09:02,507
I'll do it. I'll get rid of it.
Give it to me.

102
00:09:05,552 --> 00:09:07,221
Thank you.

103
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:19,233
- There you go, sir.
- Thank you.

104
00:09:19,316 --> 00:09:21,193
- Drive careful.
- Yeah.

105
00:09:29,785 --> 00:09:31,828
When I stand on my porch,

106
00:09:31,912 --> 00:09:33,956
I can see the houses
where children died.

107
00:09:35,624 --> 00:09:39,753
These are the Kanes,
the Toomeys, the Zohners,

108
00:09:39,836 --> 00:09:43,590
the Robbins and the Aufieros.

109
00:09:43,715 --> 00:09:46,260
Now, I want to be clear.

110
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:49,429
I'm not interested in money -
none of us are.

111
00:09:49,513 --> 00:09:54,560
What we want is to know what
happened. And we want an apology.

112
00:09:54,643 --> 00:09:57,312
- From who?
- Whoever did this.

113
00:09:57,396 --> 00:10:01,233
I want somebody to come and say,
"We're responsible.

114
00:10:01,358 --> 00:10:04,444
"We didn't mean it,
but we're sorry."

115
00:10:04,528 --> 00:10:06,572
But who is that?

116
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:10,951
Well, we don't know.

117
00:10:11,034 --> 00:10:14,955
Mrs Anderson, our firm is
very small, just three attorneys.

118
00:10:15,038 --> 00:10:18,458
We can only take
so many cases at once

119
00:10:18,542 --> 00:10:22,963
and we have to be choosy because,
frankly, we can't afford to lose.

120
00:10:23,046 --> 00:10:28,093
We pay everything. We only get paid
if we win or settle.

121
00:10:28,176 --> 00:10:31,054
- I know.
- You want an apology.

122
00:10:31,138 --> 00:10:35,225
And I'd love to get you
that apology, but from who?

123
00:10:35,309 --> 00:10:39,146
Who is going to apologise to you and
pay me?

124
00:10:39,229 --> 00:10:42,608
There has to be a defendant
with very deep pockets.

125
00:10:42,691 --> 00:10:45,903
This is not
an inexpensive case to try.

126
00:10:49,197 --> 00:10:51,575
There's an old tannery out there.

127
00:10:51,658 --> 00:10:53,535
A tannery?

128
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:56,163
And some other small factories.

129
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:05,631
I really wish I could help you
but I can't. I'm sorry.

130
00:11:05,714 --> 00:11:11,428
Maybe you could go out to
the river, to the wells, and look.

131
00:11:11,511 --> 00:11:15,265
For what?
What would that accomplish?

132
00:11:19,603 --> 00:11:23,732
I do hope you find someone.
And I am sorry.

133
00:11:36,912 --> 00:11:40,415
- Thank you very much.
- Drive carefully.

134
00:14:42,764 --> 00:14:45,017
It was fate.

135
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:50,063
I was meant to get that ticket,
at that moment, at that exact spot.

136
00:14:51,148 --> 00:14:53,275
Do you know who Beatrice is?

137
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:58,864
Peter Pan peanut butter,

138
00:14:58,947 --> 00:15:00,282
Tropicana orange juice,

139
00:15:00,365 --> 00:15:01,909
Rosarita Mexican Food,

140
00:15:02,075 --> 00:15:05,996
Swiss Miss cocoa, Samsonite
luggage... The list goes on!

141
00:15:06,121 --> 00:15:08,457
- And the other one?
- W.R. Grace.

142
00:15:08,498 --> 00:15:10,626
Chemical plants in two dozen states,

143
00:15:10,667 --> 00:15:12,753
South America, Europe and Japan.

144
00:15:12,836 --> 00:15:14,963
- What's this?
- The ticket.

145
00:15:15,088 --> 00:15:17,925
No, I've got that right here.

146
00:15:18,008 --> 00:15:22,221
- I got two speeding tickets.
- A two-ticket town?

147
00:15:22,304 --> 00:15:24,765
Exactly.
Don't take your Caddie there.

148
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:28,977
Kevin, it's a gold mine.
You almost let it get away.

149
00:15:29,019 --> 00:15:31,730
I almost let it get away.

150
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:39,571
Lawsuits are war -
it's as simple as that.

151
00:15:39,655 --> 00:15:43,742
And they begin the same way,
with a declaration of war -

152
00:15:43,825 --> 00:15:45,869
the complaint.

153
00:15:45,953 --> 00:15:48,789
When you're a small firm
and they're big,

154
00:15:48,872 --> 00:15:50,999
steeped in history and wealth,

155
00:15:51,124 --> 00:15:53,502
with Persian carpets on the floor

156
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:55,754
and Harvard diplomas on the walls,

157
00:15:55,837 --> 00:15:58,215
it's easy to be intimidated.

158
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,676
Don't - that's what they want.

159
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:03,595
That's what they expect,
like all bullies.

160
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:05,973
That's how they win.

161
00:16:07,224 --> 00:16:09,685
I don't run away from bullies.

162
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:37,671
Mr Facher...

163
00:16:37,754 --> 00:16:41,216
Mr Doyle asked
me to bring this to you.

164
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:53,937
When?

165
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:56,648
- When did he ask me?
- Yeah.

166
00:16:56,732 --> 00:16:57,900
Just now.

167
00:16:58,025 --> 00:17:02,779
On your lunch break?
That hardly seems fair.

168
00:17:02,863 --> 00:17:07,451
I almost never go to lunch, sir.
Too much to do.

169
00:17:07,492 --> 00:17:09,494
I just grab something.

170
00:17:09,578 --> 00:17:13,415
You know, I'd make a point
of taking an hour or so

171
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:16,084
away from all the noise
and insanity.

172
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:17,669
I should do that.

173
00:17:17,753 --> 00:17:21,173
I'd find a place that was
relatively quiet and peaceful,

174
00:17:21,256 --> 00:17:23,884
have a sandwich, read a magazine.

175
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:27,471
Maybe listen to a game
if one was on.

176
00:17:29,223 --> 00:17:34,519
I'd make sure everyone knew not
to disturb me during that hour.

177
00:17:34,603 --> 00:17:38,190
Because that would be my time -
my own private time,

178
00:17:38,273 --> 00:17:42,110
which no-one, if they had any sense
of self-preservation,

179
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:44,238
would dare interrupt.

180
00:17:45,989 --> 00:17:48,075
If I were you.

181
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:51,453
I'm sorry.

182
00:18:11,014 --> 00:18:13,141
Jesus.

183
00:18:16,812 --> 00:18:18,730
Jesus!

184
00:18:26,154 --> 00:18:28,907
Jesus...

185
00:18:31,451 --> 00:18:35,289
Mr Facher, it's Bill Cheeseman -
Foley, Hoag and Elliot.

186
00:18:35,372 --> 00:18:37,082
We represent New York Grace.

187
00:18:37,165 --> 00:18:39,167
How you doing?

188
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:43,088
Well, all right, I guess,
under the circumstances.

189
00:18:43,171 --> 00:18:44,965
What circumstances are those?

190
00:18:45,048 --> 00:18:47,885
Woburn - these outrageous charges.

191
00:18:47,968 --> 00:18:51,388
This bloodsucking
ambulance chaser, Schlichtmann.

192
00:18:51,471 --> 00:18:53,015
Who?

193
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:57,227
We're co-defendants in a lawsuit,
Mr Facher, a very serious lawsuit.

194
00:18:57,311 --> 00:19:01,231
- What?
- What is that thumping?

195
00:19:03,734 --> 00:19:07,571
Yeah, well, it's gone now.
It was driving me crazy!

196
00:19:07,696 --> 00:19:11,366
I was wondering
if I could talk to you.

197
00:19:11,491 --> 00:19:15,954
- Could we meet for a drink or...
- What's on your mind?

198
00:19:16,038 --> 00:19:18,707
I'll tell you what I'm thinking.

199
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:22,377
- Are you familiar with Rule 11?
- With what?

200
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:24,755
Rule 11, a civil provision

201
00:19:24,838 --> 00:19:27,883
to prevent frivolous and
irresponsible lawsuits like this,

202
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:31,011
and sanction quite severely
those who file them.

203
00:19:32,221 --> 00:19:36,350
Mr...Cheeseman. Cheeseman, is it?

204
00:19:38,936 --> 00:19:41,146
Mr Cheeseman. What is a fine?

205
00:19:41,271 --> 00:19:44,775
You get fined,
you pay it and carry on.

206
00:19:44,858 --> 00:19:50,239
If you're gonna knock a guy down,
do it so he can't get up again.

207
00:19:53,533 --> 00:19:56,286
What are you looking for
with this suit?

208
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:59,039
Obviously, we're seeking
compensation for the families

209
00:19:59,122 --> 00:20:02,626
and punitive damages for wilful
negligence by these companies.

210
00:20:02,751 --> 00:20:05,837
But is that what
this is about - money?

211
00:20:05,921 --> 00:20:08,966
- No.
- Is that what matters most?

212
00:20:09,049 --> 00:20:11,843
- No.
- It's about this.

213
00:20:15,305 --> 00:20:17,140
And this.

214
00:20:20,602 --> 00:20:22,521
And this.

215
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:25,691
Yeah.

216
00:20:27,067 --> 00:20:30,279
Yeah, I know, we have
no feelings, no compassion,

217
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:32,364
no empathy for
our clients' suffering.

218
00:20:32,447 --> 00:20:34,199
Can I say something?

219
00:20:34,283 --> 00:20:37,119
What does that
have to do with anything?

220
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:39,872
The lawyer who shares
his client's pain

221
00:20:39,955 --> 00:20:42,249
does his client
such a grave disservice

222
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:45,794
he should have his licence
to practise taken away.

223
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,381
It clouds his judgement,
and that's as useful

224
00:20:49,464 --> 00:20:52,634
as a doctor
who's frightened of blood.

225
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:53,719
All rise.

226
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:57,472
This court is now in session.

227
00:20:57,556 --> 00:21:00,767
The Honourable
Walter J Skinner presiding.

228
00:21:00,851 --> 00:21:02,895
Is this the only case?

229
00:21:02,978 --> 00:21:05,772
This is a lot of lawyers.

230
00:21:05,856 --> 00:21:07,691
Sit down.

231
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:16,617
You're looking well.
The Red Sox must be in first place.

232
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,786
Roger Clemens
is the answer to my prayers.

233
00:21:21,163 --> 00:21:23,165
You have some interest in this case?

234
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:28,295
I'm a co-defendant, but it's not
my motion. It's Foley-Hoag's.

235
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,714
- And that motion?
- Your Honour.

236
00:21:30,797 --> 00:21:33,759
- I'm Jan Schlichtmann.
- I know. Sit down.

237
00:21:35,677 --> 00:21:38,138
The matter before us seems simple.

238
00:21:38,222 --> 00:21:41,892
- Your Honour, it isn't.
- May I hear it?

239
00:21:42,017 --> 00:21:44,978
The intention here is to place me

240
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:47,981
under a cloud of impropriety.

241
00:21:48,065 --> 00:21:50,359
- Really?
- Yes. What they're saying

242
00:21:50,484 --> 00:21:54,905
is that they know law and I don't,
they're real lawyers and I'm not.

243
00:21:54,988 --> 00:21:57,199
They're just trying to humiliate me.

244
00:21:57,282 --> 00:22:02,788
You are a personal injury lawyer,
aren't you? I think you'll survive.

245
00:22:03,705 --> 00:22:07,292
- See? It's starting already.
- No, you've started already.

246
00:22:07,417 --> 00:22:09,711
I'm on the defensive,
they're the defendants.

247
00:22:09,836 --> 00:22:13,465
Do you think
I might hear this motion

248
00:22:13,549 --> 00:22:17,052
before You explain to ME
what it's really about?

249
00:22:18,428 --> 00:22:20,889
- Of course.
- Thank you.

250
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:28,021
Now, Mr...Cheeseman, is it?

251
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:34,152
Your motion to dismiss
is based on?

252
00:22:34,236 --> 00:22:36,071
Rule 11, Your Honour.

253
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:40,492
Specifically that Mr Schlichtmann had
no evidential grounds

254
00:22:40,534 --> 00:22:42,703
on which to bring this suit -

255
00:22:42,786 --> 00:22:47,583
only his knowledge that W.R. Grace
Corporation has a lot of money.

256
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:49,126
Not true.

257
00:22:49,209 --> 00:22:53,422
He performed no real investigation,
did no research of any consequence,

258
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:56,800
except perhaps
to review profit statements.

259
00:22:56,884 --> 00:23:01,471
And he's prepared his complaint
so inexpertly as to render it moot.

260
00:23:01,555 --> 00:23:05,601
- All untrue.
- Do you know what Rule 11 is?

261
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:09,438
To be honest, Your Honour,
I had to look it up.

262
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:15,277
I'll be honest, so did l.
Do you know why, Mr Cheeseman?

263
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,155
Because it is so old and ambiguous

264
00:23:18,238 --> 00:23:21,617
few lawyers
waste their time with it, or mine.

265
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:26,246
It's a non-issue, Mr Cheeseman.
Your motion is denied. Thank you.

266
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:28,165
Thank you.

267
00:23:28,248 --> 00:23:30,792
- Anything else?
- No, Your Honour.

268
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:32,794
Set a trial date.

269
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:36,632
Excuse me, Mr Facher.
I'd like to thank you.

270
00:23:36,757 --> 00:23:41,178
That was very statesman-like of you
not to join that ridiculous attack.

271
00:23:43,472 --> 00:23:45,390
You're welcome.

272
00:23:48,644 --> 00:23:50,854
We have to show how

273
00:23:50,938 --> 00:23:54,524
the toxic solvents these factories
dumped on the land there,

274
00:23:54,608 --> 00:23:59,571
were drawn into the city wells here
and Well H over there,

275
00:23:59,696 --> 00:24:02,407
and then pumped
into east Woburn homes.

276
00:24:02,491 --> 00:24:05,994
So I'll need to inspect
and map the debris,

277
00:24:06,078 --> 00:24:08,372
drill some monitoring wells,

278
00:24:08,413 --> 00:24:12,125
conduct seismic tests, and so on.

279
00:24:12,167 --> 00:24:16,213
And you're talking about you
and a couple of assistants?

280
00:24:16,296 --> 00:24:19,675
No. I mean a team of
geologists and engineers.

281
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:23,053
- A team?
- A big team.

282
00:24:26,515 --> 00:24:28,517
It's actually quite exciting.

283
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,354
The nature of the contour
here means there's an effect -

284
00:24:32,437 --> 00:24:34,106
named after me, actually...

285
00:24:37,818 --> 00:24:43,031
In the shop, Mr Roberts,
you used solvents to clean brushes?

286
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:49,705
What would you've done with that
stuff back in the 1970s and '80s?

287
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:54,835
- Used solvent? Put it in drums.
- 35-gallon drums?

288
00:24:54,877 --> 00:24:57,462
What would you do with full drums?

289
00:24:57,546 --> 00:25:00,215
- Don't know.
- They just went?

290
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:03,468
- Never noticed.
- Did you dump them?

291
00:25:03,552 --> 00:25:06,972
- No.
- Nothing like that?

292
00:25:07,014 --> 00:25:10,434
- Never noticed anyone who did?
- No.

293
00:25:10,517 --> 00:25:13,520
Just disappeared...

294
00:25:13,562 --> 00:25:16,231
What were your duties
at Grace, Mr Shalline?

295
00:25:16,315 --> 00:25:22,195
Discharge to the drains. Be sure
we weren't polluting the air.

296
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:27,784
Then you know that chemicals
were deposited behind the plant?

297
00:25:27,868 --> 00:25:29,912
I don't know that.

298
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:32,372
Six barrels of toxic waste

299
00:25:32,456 --> 00:25:36,710
were found there in a pit
and exhumed by city inspectors.

300
00:25:36,793 --> 00:25:38,795
- You didn't know?
- Nope.

301
00:25:38,879 --> 00:25:43,926
Back in 1965 did you
clean metal parts with solvent?

302
00:25:43,967 --> 00:25:45,093
Yes.

303
00:25:45,177 --> 00:25:47,888
- What kind?
- That I couldn't say.

304
00:25:47,971 --> 00:25:52,726
Did you ever notice
the name trichlorethylene or TCE?

305
00:25:52,809 --> 00:25:54,061
I don't know.

306
00:25:54,144 --> 00:25:58,523
But you'd put it in barrels
when you were finished, right?

307
00:25:58,607 --> 00:25:59,608
Yes.

308
00:25:59,733 --> 00:26:04,279
Did you ever see
what happened to these barrels?

309
00:26:04,321 --> 00:26:05,280
Yes.

310
00:26:15,541 --> 00:26:16,959
What was that?

311
00:26:20,254 --> 00:26:23,924
- They get dumped.
- Where?

312
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:27,553
- Out back, in the ground.
- You saw this?

313
00:26:27,678 --> 00:26:29,137
Yes.

314
00:26:29,221 --> 00:26:31,098
- When?
- My coffee break.

315
00:26:31,181 --> 00:26:35,936
I would go out and hit
nine-iron shots with golf balls.

316
00:26:36,019 --> 00:26:38,063
Do you want a break?

317
00:26:38,146 --> 00:26:41,817
- Do you need a break?
- No.

318
00:26:41,942 --> 00:26:46,822
Did you see who was dumping
the stuff while hitting golf balls?

319
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:52,452
- What do you mean?
- The names of people.

320
00:26:55,622 --> 00:26:57,583
He wants to tell us.

321
00:26:57,666 --> 00:27:01,336
He won't tell us.
He has to work there.

322
00:27:01,461 --> 00:27:07,050
But he lives near Anne Anderson.
He sees her every day.

323
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:39,291
- Mr Love, do you have any children?
- Yes, I do.

324
00:27:39,374 --> 00:27:41,376
- Eight of them.
- Eight?

325
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:44,671
My goodness! That's quite a family.

326
00:27:45,881 --> 00:27:49,718
What do you think
of the water in Woburn?

327
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,095
Now? It's all right.

328
00:27:52,221 --> 00:27:54,681
What about then, 15 years ago?

329
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:58,894
It had an odour then.
Chlorine or something.

330
00:28:00,187 --> 00:28:03,065
- Did you drink it?
- Yeah.

331
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:06,735
- The kids?
- Yes.

332
00:28:08,987 --> 00:28:12,407
Were you concerned when you found
the wells were contaminated?

333
00:28:12,532 --> 00:28:16,370
I object to that.
You don't have to answer that.

334
00:28:18,872 --> 00:28:22,626
- Yeah, I was concerned.
- For your family?

335
00:28:22,709 --> 00:28:23,710
Yes.

336
00:28:23,794 --> 00:28:27,881
Has any member of your family
had any unusual illness?

337
00:28:27,965 --> 00:28:33,178
You don't have to answer
any of these type of questions.

338
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:35,180
- Yeah.
- What kind?

339
00:28:35,264 --> 00:28:37,266
One of my sons has seizures,

340
00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:40,310
my eldest daughter
has had two miscarriages

341
00:28:40,394 --> 00:28:42,437
and my youngest was born with...

342
00:28:42,521 --> 00:28:46,024
Are we going to go through
their entire medical history?

343
00:28:46,108 --> 00:28:48,652
If you don't want to hear, leave.

344
00:28:48,735 --> 00:28:52,072
What's wrong? We're deposing
Grace employees, not Beatrice.

345
00:28:52,155 --> 00:28:57,744
- I have a right to be here.
- Then sit down and shut up!

346
00:29:07,671 --> 00:29:09,506
Mr Love,

347
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:15,345
are you aware that some of your
neighbours have had leukaemia?

348
00:29:15,429 --> 00:29:17,139
Yes, I am.

349
00:29:18,515 --> 00:29:20,559
They think it's the water.

350
00:29:21,643 --> 00:29:25,689
Al, that water
hasn't made anybody sick.

351
00:29:27,733 --> 00:29:32,529
- How do you know?
- I just do.

352
00:29:33,739 --> 00:29:36,825
A lot of people in my neighbourhood
are dead,

353
00:29:36,909 --> 00:29:39,453
or dying, Mr Chessman,
from something.

354
00:29:41,622 --> 00:29:44,917
Look, if I took a hundred pennies

355
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,336
and threw them in the air,

356
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:51,131
half would land heads
and half tails, right?

357
00:29:51,173 --> 00:29:55,636
Looking close, I'd probably find
some heads grouped together.

358
00:29:55,677 --> 00:29:58,096
Does that mean anything?

359
00:29:58,138 --> 00:30:01,558
You see, no one knows
what causes leukaemia, Al.

360
00:30:01,642 --> 00:30:06,063
No one knows
what caused that cluster.

361
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:10,317
I know what happened.
And I know who did it.

362
00:30:15,739 --> 00:30:17,783
Al, this is very important.

363
00:30:18,992 --> 00:30:22,120
I want you to tell me
who those people are.

364
00:30:22,204 --> 00:30:25,290
I'm not a rat.

365
00:30:25,332 --> 00:30:27,376
You know, it's important,

366
00:30:27,417 --> 00:30:30,295
because if there is something wrong,

367
00:30:30,379 --> 00:30:33,423
we need to disclose it
to the authorities.

368
00:30:33,507 --> 00:30:37,636
We need to get them out there
and have it cleaned up.

369
00:30:39,596 --> 00:30:42,724
You think about that and call me.

370
00:30:42,808 --> 00:30:44,726
Yeah. Yeah.

371
00:31:10,836 --> 00:31:13,005
Do you eat peanut butter?

372
00:31:14,506 --> 00:31:15,924
No.

373
00:31:16,008 --> 00:31:17,718
You've never eaten peanut butter?

374
00:31:17,801 --> 00:31:20,262
I guess everyone alive
has tried it,

375
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:23,432
but I'm not a peanut butter fan.

376
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:28,395
Did your son
ever eat peanut butter?

377
00:31:30,939 --> 00:31:34,610
- Do you eat bacon?
- Yes.

378
00:31:34,735 --> 00:31:38,113
- Yes.
- How often? How many slices?

379
00:31:41,491 --> 00:31:44,328
Do you have Teflon pans
in your kitchen?

380
00:31:44,411 --> 00:31:47,873
Do you chew sugarless gum?
Do you pump your own gas?

381
00:31:47,956 --> 00:31:51,543
Do you use hair spray?
Do you use artificial sweeteners?

382
00:31:51,668 --> 00:31:55,756
Smoke cigarettes? Drink diet soda?
Use tampons?

383
00:31:55,839 --> 00:31:57,758
Are your clothes ever dry-cleaned?

384
00:31:57,841 --> 00:32:01,136
Do you have silver fillings
in your teeth?

385
00:32:03,096 --> 00:32:08,143
You knew when you moved to Woburn
that its water didn't taste good?

386
00:32:08,268 --> 00:32:12,397
Yeah, but lots of places
the water doesn't taste so good.

387
00:32:12,481 --> 00:32:14,399
I agree with that.

388
00:32:14,483 --> 00:32:16,944
Did you ever consider
using bottled water?

389
00:32:17,027 --> 00:32:21,114
We used bottled water off and on,
split half and half.

390
00:32:21,198 --> 00:32:25,118
Like...we cooked with
regular water - tap water.

391
00:32:25,244 --> 00:32:28,288
We did other things,
like make orange juice.

392
00:32:28,372 --> 00:32:31,041
But to...drink just straight
water, we drank bottled water.

393
00:32:33,335 --> 00:32:37,881
Has a doctor ever said that you have
any immune system dysfunction?

394
00:32:37,965 --> 00:32:43,845
No. But when my son died,
they told us that was why he died.

395
00:32:43,929 --> 00:32:46,473
His immune system was...

396
00:32:47,558 --> 00:32:49,601
tore down to nothing.

397
00:32:55,232 --> 00:32:59,361
- Why did you have an autopsy?
- Because he was doing good.

398
00:32:59,403 --> 00:33:02,990
He only lived three months
with leukaemia

399
00:33:03,031 --> 00:33:05,033
and he looked fine.

400
00:33:05,117 --> 00:33:08,287
Did you talk to the doctor
about this?

401
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:12,374
I had more like
a violent talk with him.

402
00:33:14,042 --> 00:33:18,046
- "Violent"? You were angry?
- Yelling at him.

403
00:33:18,088 --> 00:33:22,217
Your son seemed to be doing
all right. He was in remission?

404
00:33:22,301 --> 00:33:24,595
You were optimistic about his future

405
00:33:24,678 --> 00:33:27,598
and suddenly he became ill and died.

406
00:33:27,681 --> 00:33:30,225
And they said that was expected -

407
00:33:30,309 --> 00:33:34,855
that anybody with a disease like
leukaemia could die any minute.

408
00:33:36,607 --> 00:33:40,903
- But you were angry and upset.
- My son just died.

409
00:33:40,986 --> 00:33:45,699
I understand, I'm just
trying to recreate the event.

410
00:33:45,782 --> 00:33:49,703
You know when your child isn't well.

411
00:33:49,828 --> 00:33:52,289
You try to explain on the phone

412
00:33:52,372 --> 00:33:55,000
and they say,
"Has he got a temperature?"

413
00:33:55,083 --> 00:33:58,003
You say, "No."
"He's all right, then," they say.

414
00:33:58,086 --> 00:34:01,381
"Don't worry - bring him
into the clinic Monday."

415
00:34:03,175 --> 00:34:05,552
He died Monday morning.

416
00:34:07,554 --> 00:34:10,515
He was in the clinic when he died?

417
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:12,184
No.

418
00:34:13,268 --> 00:34:17,189
He was in the car on the way.

419
00:34:26,823 --> 00:34:29,701
He died in the car
on the way to the clinic?

420
00:34:29,785 --> 00:34:34,831
He died on l-93,
up by the Somerville exit.

421
00:34:43,215 --> 00:34:47,427
My wife was yelling
that he'd stopped breathing.

422
00:34:47,469 --> 00:34:52,224
I pulled over
and tried to give him CPR.

423
00:34:54,268 --> 00:34:59,147
I was holding him in my lap.

424
00:35:01,942 --> 00:35:03,986
Lauren was...

425
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:06,697
screaming.

426
00:35:09,074 --> 00:35:12,995
Cars and trucks rushing by.

427
00:35:16,331 --> 00:35:18,375
And...

428
00:35:19,459 --> 00:35:21,753
she helped...

429
00:35:25,215 --> 00:35:27,259
I'm sorry.

430
00:35:28,343 --> 00:35:30,387
It's all right.

431
00:35:33,515 --> 00:35:35,434
It's OK.

432
00:35:55,621 --> 00:35:57,706
These people can never testify.

433
00:35:57,789 --> 00:35:59,625
No.

434
00:36:34,868 --> 00:36:38,997
We'll have the first seven
monitor wells in this area,

435
00:36:39,081 --> 00:36:41,083
in the permeable rock here.

436
00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:42,876
All right. There's seven?

437
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,962
Yes. I did say only seven.

438
00:36:45,045 --> 00:36:47,714
Now we'll probably
have 12, because...

439
00:36:47,798 --> 00:36:50,634
Hey! Hey!

440
00:36:53,554 --> 00:36:56,431
- Private property.
- Yes, your property.

441
00:36:56,515 --> 00:36:58,684
My property and you're trespassing.

442
00:36:58,767 --> 00:37:00,936
- Here.
- What the fuck is this?

443
00:37:01,019 --> 00:37:05,691
That's a court order, Mr Riley,
giving me the right to be here,

444
00:37:05,774 --> 00:37:09,194
and to inspect every inch
of your tannery, too.

445
00:37:09,319 --> 00:37:11,697
No, keep that. That's your copy.

446
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,326
Let's go.

447
00:37:25,168 --> 00:37:28,964
I started working
when I was seven years old,

448
00:37:29,006 --> 00:37:32,759
sweeping the beam house floors
for my father,

449
00:37:32,843 --> 00:37:37,556
which he swept for his father
when he was seven years old.

450
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,602
- Which my boys...
- I know. They swept it, too.

451
00:37:41,685 --> 00:37:46,565
Please answer the question I asked.
Silicone and trichlorethylene.

452
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:48,525
These two chemicals mixed together

453
00:37:48,609 --> 00:37:51,778
are used to waterproof leather,
are they not?

454
00:37:53,322 --> 00:37:56,909
I asked you a question,
Mr Riley - again.

455
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:03,874
Please inform your client that he's
obligated to answer my question.

456
00:38:15,427 --> 00:38:18,096
Let the record show
that the witness

457
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:21,475
emptied a glass of water
on my conference table.

458
00:38:21,558 --> 00:38:27,189
What exactly do you intend to say
to me by pouring water on my table?

459
00:38:27,272 --> 00:38:30,943
It's how silicone
is used to waterproof leather.

460
00:38:31,068 --> 00:38:32,903
I'm answering your question.

461
00:38:32,986 --> 00:38:37,950
It's poured on,
like you poured water on my table.

462
00:38:38,075 --> 00:38:39,868
Yeah. Correct.

463
00:38:39,952 --> 00:38:42,996
So some of it must
spill off the leather,

464
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,457
Iike the water spilling
off my table...

465
00:38:45,541 --> 00:38:47,918
and onto my rug.

466
00:38:48,669 --> 00:38:50,963
That's the part I'm interested in.

467
00:38:52,756 --> 00:38:55,968
The spilled silicone
and trichlorethylene, sir,

468
00:38:56,051 --> 00:38:58,095
how you disposed of that.

469
00:38:59,179 --> 00:39:03,809
- I never once used TCE.
- TCE? Did I say TCE?

470
00:39:03,892 --> 00:39:06,270
I didn't say TCE.

471
00:39:06,353 --> 00:39:08,647
I said trichlorethylene.

472
00:39:12,234 --> 00:39:14,152
You said TCE -

473
00:39:14,236 --> 00:39:17,447
as it is commonly known...

474
00:39:17,531 --> 00:39:20,158
to those who know it.

475
00:39:21,326 --> 00:39:24,997
Mr Riley, would you mind if
I checked your statements today

476
00:39:25,122 --> 00:39:28,667
against your records - invoices,
purchase orders and formulas?

477
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:34,423
No. Be my guest.
They go back...three years.

478
00:39:34,506 --> 00:39:37,259
Everything before that, we dumped.

479
00:39:45,976 --> 00:39:50,105
- Jan, you're not listening.
- You've been out there three times.

480
00:39:50,188 --> 00:39:52,733
I know why
you find this unacceptable.

481
00:39:52,816 --> 00:39:56,486
But you don't know what it's like.
Riley is Woburn.

482
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:59,489
His employees are loyal subjects.
They won't talk.

483
00:39:59,573 --> 00:40:02,701
Ex-employees, that's who
you should be talking to.

484
00:40:02,784 --> 00:40:07,581
- Disgruntled employees, they talk.
- You want me to go back there?

485
00:40:07,664 --> 00:40:12,794
This is THE case against Beatrice.
He's a liar. Go back and catch him.

486
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:16,340
- You got the medical records?
- I can't...

487
00:40:16,381 --> 00:40:18,800
Just get it.

488
00:40:36,401 --> 00:40:40,072
This figure here,
this 100 an hour for Dr Cohen,

489
00:40:40,197 --> 00:40:42,824
that seems fair,
considering his pre-eminence.

490
00:40:42,908 --> 00:40:45,369
That's for his nights in the hotel.

491
00:40:45,452 --> 00:40:47,538
That's his discount sleeping rate.

492
00:40:49,331 --> 00:40:53,085
- Your doctors have cost 900,000.
- They're worth it.

493
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:57,422
- Your geologists over 500,000.
- They're worth it.

494
00:40:57,506 --> 00:41:01,343
The point is, everybody here
is working on this case.

495
00:41:01,468 --> 00:41:05,389
There's no money coming in -
just going out.

496
00:41:05,472 --> 00:41:08,016
You want to cut our losses now?

497
00:41:08,141 --> 00:41:11,687
You want to get out
and throw away 900 and...what?

498
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:13,897
1.4 million.

499
00:41:21,655 --> 00:41:24,741
There's certain things
I've got to prove

500
00:41:24,825 --> 00:41:28,954
and I can't do that
not spending money.

501
00:41:28,996 --> 00:41:30,998
We have to see Uncle Pete.

502
00:41:36,086 --> 00:41:40,007
- Where are we on the last loan...
- Spent it.

503
00:41:40,132 --> 00:41:43,886
- How much of it?
- All of it.

504
00:41:45,345 --> 00:41:47,723
And the Carney settlement?
How much...

505
00:41:47,848 --> 00:41:51,393
- Spent it.
- On?

506
00:41:51,476 --> 00:41:54,354
Woburn.
We spend everything on Woburn now.

507
00:41:54,438 --> 00:41:57,065
On Woburn.

508
00:41:59,568 --> 00:42:03,655
What will you need
to tide you over? Two hundred?

509
00:42:03,739 --> 00:42:06,283
600,000.

510
00:42:06,325 --> 00:42:09,369
- 600,000?
- Yeah.

511
00:42:12,206 --> 00:42:16,043
Pete, when was the last time
you lost money betting on me?

512
00:42:16,168 --> 00:42:20,672
Never. I'm probably the best
investment your bank ever made.

513
00:43:10,681 --> 00:43:13,934
How do vampires
get around on Halloween?

514
00:43:14,017 --> 00:43:16,770
- Pass.
- Blood vessels.

515
00:43:57,811 --> 00:44:00,105
Let's go.

516
00:44:00,147 --> 00:44:03,025
- Bye, Dad.
- See you later. Goodbye.

517
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:06,778
Love you.

518
00:44:34,223 --> 00:44:37,976
I thought about
seeing you for a long time.

519
00:44:39,144 --> 00:44:44,608
I was afraid to 'cause...l didn't
think you'd want to talk to me,

520
00:44:44,691 --> 00:44:47,819
'cause of where I work
and everything.

521
00:44:50,405 --> 00:44:53,825
I'm concerned about what's been
happening around here and...

522
00:44:53,951 --> 00:44:57,538
I'm angry at the way
the company's handling itself.

523
00:45:08,507 --> 00:45:11,134
I'm very sorry about your son.

524
00:45:30,904 --> 00:45:32,948
Thank you.

525
00:45:40,163 --> 00:45:42,791
He said he never dumped anything,

526
00:45:42,875 --> 00:45:46,712
never did anything like that,
never saw anybody who did.

527
00:45:46,837 --> 00:45:50,966
Tommy Barbas lied.
So did Paul Shalline.

528
00:45:51,049 --> 00:45:54,636
Tommy, Paul and Joey
were out back all the time...

529
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,598
- Joey?
- Joey Miola, plant maintenance.

530
00:45:57,681 --> 00:46:01,143
And the rumour is,
there's 50 more barrels buried

531
00:46:01,226 --> 00:46:03,270
that the inspectors didn't find.

532
00:46:03,353 --> 00:46:07,024
- 50?
- Or more. Here.

533
00:46:09,943 --> 00:46:15,073
OK. Is there anyone else
at the plant that might talk to me?

534
00:46:15,199 --> 00:46:16,992
I don't think so.

535
00:46:17,075 --> 00:46:18,952
Bobby Pasqueriella.

536
00:46:19,036 --> 00:46:20,662
Bobby?

537
00:46:22,581 --> 00:46:25,375
He might. He doesn't
work there any more though.

538
00:46:25,459 --> 00:46:26,460
Could you call him?

539
00:46:28,128 --> 00:46:30,839
Yeah, that's the stuff got dumped.

540
00:46:30,923 --> 00:46:35,969
All the time. Threw it
back there myself all the time.

541
00:46:38,055 --> 00:46:41,433
Eddie Arsine - he'd say,
dump that stuff in the gully.

542
00:46:41,516 --> 00:46:44,186
Out there in the gully, you know?

543
00:46:44,269 --> 00:46:47,314
Dumped it back there
in the gully right there.

544
00:46:47,397 --> 00:46:51,735
Washed belts and gearboxes with it,
and threw it in the gully.

545
00:46:51,818 --> 00:46:55,656
He'd say, dump it out
in the gully, like Joey.

546
00:46:55,739 --> 00:47:00,702
- Did Tom Barbas?
- Tommy? No, not Tommy, no.

547
00:47:00,827 --> 00:47:03,789
- Never did that?
- No, no.

548
00:47:03,872 --> 00:47:05,916
He dumped his in a ditch.

549
00:47:12,798 --> 00:47:17,469
Mr Barbas, I understand you've had
a chance to think about things

550
00:47:17,553 --> 00:47:19,513
since your first deposition.

551
00:47:19,596 --> 00:47:23,433
He says you said
to pour it into the pit.

552
00:47:23,517 --> 00:47:26,645
Is that how you remember it now?

553
00:47:26,728 --> 00:47:31,024
He just said, go out
and dig a trench...30 feet long.

554
00:47:31,108 --> 00:47:33,151
Load the barrels onto the truck,

555
00:47:33,235 --> 00:47:36,530
drive out and dump it
into the swimming pool.

556
00:47:36,613 --> 00:47:40,367
That's what we called it -
the swimming pool.

557
00:47:43,412 --> 00:47:44,413
Right.

558
00:47:56,550 --> 00:47:58,844
Mr Cheeseman, well done.

559
00:48:00,053 --> 00:48:03,682
The odds of a plaintiff's lawyer
winning in court

560
00:48:03,765 --> 00:48:05,517
are 2 to 1 against.

561
00:48:05,601 --> 00:48:07,895
Think about that for a second.

562
00:48:07,978 --> 00:48:12,357
Your odds of surviving a game
of Russian roulette are better.

563
00:48:12,441 --> 00:48:14,484
12 times better.

564
00:48:14,568 --> 00:48:16,862
So why does anyone do it?

565
00:48:16,945 --> 00:48:18,989
They don't. They settle.

566
00:48:19,072 --> 00:48:23,285
Out of the 780,000 cases
filed each year,

567
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:30,667
The whole idea of lawsuits
is to settle,

568
00:48:30,751 --> 00:48:33,045
to compel the other side to settle.

569
00:48:33,128 --> 00:48:36,798
You do that by spending
more money than you should,

570
00:48:36,924 --> 00:48:40,302
forcing them to spend
more money than they should.

571
00:48:40,385 --> 00:48:43,764
And whoever
comes to their senses first...

572
00:48:43,805 --> 00:48:45,766
Ioses.

573
00:48:45,849 --> 00:48:49,061
Trials are a corruption
of the entire process.

574
00:48:49,144 --> 00:48:53,815
And only fools with something
to prove end up ensnared in them.

575
00:48:53,899 --> 00:48:58,445
When I say prove,
I don't mean about the case.

576
00:48:59,530 --> 00:49:01,365
I mean about themselves.

577
00:49:01,448 --> 00:49:03,992
Hey, old man, out of the way!

578
00:49:09,623 --> 00:49:12,376
- How's business?
- It's good.

579
00:49:12,459 --> 00:49:16,713
Is it? I was afraid, with
all these scientists and doctors,

580
00:49:16,797 --> 00:49:19,633
a small firm like yours
might be in trouble.

581
00:49:19,716 --> 00:49:22,177
I appreciate your concern.

582
00:49:22,261 --> 00:49:24,930
We've got more than enough
to go the distance.

583
00:49:25,013 --> 00:49:28,850
Are you sure? lf you realised
you miscalculated the arithmetic,

584
00:49:28,976 --> 00:49:32,479
you'd be digging quarters
out the seats of your car.

585
00:49:32,563 --> 00:49:37,693
- You don't have to worry, Jerry.
- That's a relief.

586
00:49:37,776 --> 00:49:43,282
You know what? You don't want me
in this case. You've got Grace.

587
00:49:43,365 --> 00:49:47,119
I'm only gonna hurt you.
So get rid of me.

588
00:49:47,202 --> 00:49:52,040
Tell me what you've got so far,
I'll get a cheque cut - OK?

589
00:49:54,001 --> 00:49:58,255
My expenses? You're offering
to cover my expenses?

590
00:49:58,338 --> 00:50:00,716
Your expenses and your pride.

591
00:50:02,843 --> 00:50:06,471
You think you're gonna put
those families on the stand.

592
00:50:06,555 --> 00:50:08,765
They'll tell their stories

593
00:50:08,807 --> 00:50:12,728
so the jury
pull out their handkerchiefs?

594
00:50:12,811 --> 00:50:17,566
Do you really think
I'd let that happen?

595
00:50:17,608 --> 00:50:21,069
I don't see how you can prevent it.

596
00:50:21,153 --> 00:50:24,281
Of course you don't.

597
00:50:39,588 --> 00:50:42,049
- Yeah?
- Jan, guess what?

598
00:50:42,174 --> 00:50:46,345
Cheeseman wants to talk.
He wants a number. He wants out.

599
00:50:46,428 --> 00:50:50,307
I'll meet you back here
at the office.

600
00:50:50,349 --> 00:50:53,977
Jan, this is it. We've got them.

601
00:50:54,061 --> 00:50:56,104
That's great.

602
00:51:23,924 --> 00:51:25,968
Oh, baby. God, no!

603
00:51:44,778 --> 00:51:47,614
Oh, God!

604
00:52:06,341 --> 00:52:08,260
He said he'd be here.

605
00:52:08,343 --> 00:52:11,179
Are the Red Sox in town?

606
00:52:15,225 --> 00:52:18,645
Sorry I'm late. I got tied up. Yeah.

607
00:52:19,730 --> 00:52:23,775
I was just given a chair
at Harvard, of all things.

608
00:52:23,859 --> 00:52:25,444
You're kidding. Which chair?

609
00:52:27,529 --> 00:52:31,450
It's black with arms, with my name on
a brass plate on the back.

610
00:52:31,533 --> 00:52:33,577
From my students.

611
00:52:34,494 --> 00:52:37,998
Jerry, ever thought about
getting yourself a new briefcase?

612
00:52:38,081 --> 00:52:42,419
You don't change your socks
in the middle of the World Series.

613
00:52:45,547 --> 00:52:47,883
Am I sitting in the right place?

614
00:52:47,966 --> 00:52:52,054
Actually, we have a seat
for you here, but that's fine.

615
00:52:58,018 --> 00:52:59,853
Nice pen.

616
00:52:59,937 --> 00:53:03,982
- They're courtesy of the hotel.
- Really?

617
00:53:04,066 --> 00:53:07,569
This is a good quality pen. Yeah.

618
00:53:10,489 --> 00:53:14,326
- So?
- So, Bill...

619
00:53:16,495 --> 00:53:19,039
How much did Grace make last year?

620
00:53:19,164 --> 00:53:23,210
I have no idea.
But I have a feeling you do.

621
00:53:23,293 --> 00:53:27,130
198 million. And Beatrice, Jerry?

622
00:53:27,214 --> 00:53:31,051
- What?
- 436 million.

623
00:53:31,134 --> 00:53:36,014
Together, that's 634 million.
That's one year. That's net.

624
00:53:37,266 --> 00:53:39,560
So, that's what they made.

625
00:53:39,643 --> 00:53:43,480
What should they be made to pay
to compensate the families,

626
00:53:43,605 --> 00:53:46,733
to provide for their
economic security in the future?

627
00:53:46,817 --> 00:53:51,321
Don't forget to mention you -
compensating you.

628
00:53:52,739 --> 00:53:56,493
And to make sure
that this doesn't happen again.

629
00:53:57,619 --> 00:53:59,663
25 million cash.

630
00:54:07,170 --> 00:54:10,716
And another 25 million
to establish a research foundation

631
00:54:10,799 --> 00:54:15,053
to study the links between
hazardous waste and illness.

632
00:54:20,142 --> 00:54:23,812
And 1.5 million per family
annually for 30 years.

633
00:54:50,172 --> 00:54:53,091
320 million.

634
00:54:56,845 --> 00:54:58,722
Can I ask a question?

635
00:54:58,847 --> 00:55:02,100
I'm sure everyone has questions.
What's yours, Jerry?

636
00:55:03,435 --> 00:55:05,270
Can I have this?

637
00:55:09,483 --> 00:55:10,901
Thank you.

638
00:55:14,279 --> 00:55:16,114
Excuse me.

639
00:55:38,971 --> 00:55:42,641
- Jan?
- Yes, Gordon?

640
00:55:42,724 --> 00:55:45,352
What's the story?

641
00:55:45,435 --> 00:55:49,273
- They don't want to end this.
- They don't...

642
00:55:49,398 --> 00:55:54,736
You said this wouldn't go to trial.
You just made certain that it will.

643
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:57,155
Without consulting us, I might add.

644
00:55:57,823 --> 00:55:59,867
They patronise us.

645
00:56:01,326 --> 00:56:03,245
They think we're blackmailers.

646
00:56:06,290 --> 00:56:08,417
They think they can buy us.

647
00:56:10,586 --> 00:56:12,546
Yeah?

648
00:56:13,672 --> 00:56:15,757
We can't afford a long trial.

649
00:56:15,841 --> 00:56:19,177
Find a way
of getting some money, then.

650
00:56:19,261 --> 00:56:24,266
- What do you suggest?
- Am I the financial advisor?

651
00:56:25,559 --> 00:56:26,977
No, you're not.

652
00:56:30,814 --> 00:56:34,401
This is the plan.
Start with scientific evidence.

653
00:56:34,484 --> 00:56:37,112
Then the medical experts
and their evidence.

654
00:56:37,196 --> 00:56:39,656
Then the parents,
then your testimony.

655
00:56:39,781 --> 00:56:41,867
Your presence is very important.

656
00:56:41,950 --> 00:56:44,912
It's where the jury
gets to know you.

657
00:56:44,995 --> 00:56:50,584
If you're only there some days,
they'll ask "why? Does she care?"

658
00:56:50,667 --> 00:56:54,755
I'll be there every day,
in the back left-hand corner.

659
00:56:54,838 --> 00:56:56,882
Wherever you're comfortable.

660
00:56:56,965 --> 00:56:59,635
That was our plan.

661
00:56:59,718 --> 00:57:05,057
If we got separated in the grocery
store that's where we'd meet.

662
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:06,975
Oh, I see, I see.

663
00:57:10,812 --> 00:57:13,190
In the end, when he was dying,

664
00:57:13,273 --> 00:57:18,403
he said, I'll meet you in the
back left-hand corner of heaven.

665
00:57:29,748 --> 00:57:33,585
All rise.
This court is now in session.

666
00:57:33,669 --> 00:57:36,797
The Honourable
Walter J Skinner presiding.

667
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:39,633
Civil Action 841672.

668
00:57:39,716 --> 00:57:44,513
Anderson and all versus
W.R. Grace and Beatrice Foods.

669
00:57:51,436 --> 00:57:54,481
Ladies and gentlemen...

670
00:57:54,523 --> 00:57:58,360
there's a small town
north of Boston called Woburn.

671
00:57:58,443 --> 00:58:02,030
Woburn is like many small towns.

672
00:58:02,114 --> 00:58:07,244
It has homes, it has churches,
it has schools, it has industry.

673
00:58:07,369 --> 00:58:10,372
But Woburn has something else.

674
00:58:10,455 --> 00:58:15,919
It has more than its share
of sickness and death.

675
00:58:16,003 --> 00:58:19,756
Small amounts of solvents
were left on the ground.

676
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:22,217
Why? To evaporate.

677
00:58:22,259 --> 00:58:24,636
Did they? Yes.

678
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:30,893
These chemicals never reached
Wells G and H - we will show that.

679
00:58:31,018 --> 00:58:34,938
And they never made anyone sick.
We will show that, too.

680
00:58:35,063 --> 00:58:39,443
The idea of criminal court
is crime and punishment.

681
00:58:39,526 --> 00:58:43,655
The idea of civil court
and personal injury law by nature -

682
00:58:43,739 --> 00:58:45,782
though no-one says it,

683
00:58:45,824 --> 00:58:49,661
Ieast of all
the personal injury lawyer himself -

684
00:58:49,745 --> 00:58:51,622
is money.

685
00:58:51,663 --> 00:58:54,124
Money for suffering.
Money for death.

686
00:58:54,249 --> 00:58:57,169
As if that
could somehow relieve suffering.

687
00:58:57,252 --> 00:59:01,715
As if that could somehow
bring dead children back to life.

688
00:59:03,050 --> 00:59:07,179
Every credit card application
we send, we get more in the mail.

689
00:59:07,262 --> 00:59:13,143
Here's one from North Dakota.
Fill it out. Fill them all out.

690
00:59:13,227 --> 00:59:15,854
It's the last great pyramid scheme.

691
00:59:15,938 --> 00:59:20,901
The terrain of East Woburn was
actually shaped 12,000 years ago,

692
00:59:20,943 --> 00:59:23,862
during the end of the last lce Age.

693
00:59:23,946 --> 00:59:27,407
At this time, an immense glacier,
over a mile thick,

694
00:59:27,449 --> 00:59:30,202
covered what is now New England.

695
00:59:30,285 --> 00:59:34,206
Cancel The American Lawyer.
Cancel all the legal journals.

696
00:59:34,331 --> 00:59:38,252
And tell the janitorial people
they're no longer required.

697
00:59:38,335 --> 00:59:40,420
We'll empty our own ashtrays.

698
00:59:40,504 --> 00:59:44,508
To understand what's going on
in the ground water system,

699
00:59:44,591 --> 00:59:48,804
we must start with the soil itself.
These are soil samples...

700
00:59:48,887 --> 00:59:51,139
So you see,
the Aberjona River valley...

701
00:59:51,223 --> 00:59:55,060
I...l can't send you
the entire balance right now.

702
00:59:55,185 --> 00:59:59,314
But perhaps we could work out
some sort of a deal.

703
01:00:00,399 --> 01:00:03,360
How much can I send you right now?

704
01:00:03,443 --> 01:00:05,279
Nothing.

705
01:00:05,362 --> 01:00:08,907
A plaintiff's case
depends on momentum.

706
01:00:08,991 --> 01:00:13,245
The fewer objections he gets,
the better his case will go.

707
01:00:13,328 --> 01:00:15,873
So whenever you can,
you should object.

708
01:00:15,998 --> 01:00:19,001
18 times yesterday, 20 today.

709
01:00:19,084 --> 01:00:21,336
They're not even his witnesses,
they're his.

710
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:25,549
I can't not object when you
phrase questions improperly.

711
01:00:25,632 --> 01:00:27,259
As a craftsman...

712
01:00:27,342 --> 01:00:31,555
He is deliberately trying
to destroy the rhythm of my case.

713
01:00:32,890 --> 01:00:37,311
Here we are. You must have
some good luck on these.

714
01:00:37,394 --> 01:00:41,064
- Hold on. 17, 17, 17.
- You got a winner?

715
01:00:41,190 --> 01:00:42,649
No! Shoot.

716
01:00:42,733 --> 01:00:46,195
Relevance - objection.
Hearsay - objection.

717
01:00:46,278 --> 01:00:50,282
Best evidence - objection.
Authenticity...

718
01:00:50,365 --> 01:00:51,742
Objection.

719
01:00:51,825 --> 01:00:57,039
If you fall asleep, the first thing
you say when you wake up is...

720
01:01:01,168 --> 01:01:02,836
Objection.

721
01:01:04,171 --> 01:01:08,634
Do you swear to tell
the whole truth, so help you God?

722
01:01:08,717 --> 01:01:10,260
Yes.

723
01:01:10,344 --> 01:01:14,723
Good morning, Mr Riley. Would
you care for a glass of water?

724
01:01:16,183 --> 01:01:18,060
No, thank you.

725
01:01:19,519 --> 01:01:21,021
Are you sure?

726
01:01:22,272 --> 01:01:26,735
The single greatest liability
for a lawyer is pride.

727
01:01:26,818 --> 01:01:28,695
Pride...

728
01:01:28,779 --> 01:01:32,950
pride has lost more cases
than lousy evidence,

729
01:01:33,033 --> 01:01:36,203
idiot witnesses and
a hanging judge put together.

730
01:01:36,286 --> 01:01:40,707
There is absolutely no place
in a courtroom for pride.

731
01:01:40,791 --> 01:01:45,462
Mr Riley, you own the property
referred to here as the 15 acres?

732
01:01:45,546 --> 01:01:49,216
No, it's currently owned
by a non-profit corporation

733
01:01:49,341 --> 01:01:51,385
called The Wildwood Conservancy.

734
01:01:51,468 --> 01:01:54,721
Oh, yes. What is that?
The Wildwood Conservancy.

735
01:01:54,805 --> 01:01:57,849
- Is that a conservation group?
- Yes, sir.

736
01:01:57,933 --> 01:02:02,479
I've donated the land as
a sanctuary for indigent wildlife.

737
01:02:04,815 --> 01:02:09,236
I don't think the indigent wildlife
has heard about this, Mr Riley.

738
01:02:09,319 --> 01:02:14,199
I've been there several times
and haven't seen any living thing.

739
01:02:14,283 --> 01:02:18,829
He says no, no, no.
He says yes once, I've got him.

740
01:02:18,912 --> 01:02:20,956
He's not that stupid.

741
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:25,502
Keep him there long enough,
he'll figure a way to get you.

742
01:02:25,586 --> 01:02:27,379
I'm not that stupid.

743
01:02:32,175 --> 01:02:34,720
Mr Riley, experts
have testified in this court

744
01:02:34,845 --> 01:02:36,972
that your land, your 15 acres,

745
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:40,434
is the most grotesquely polluted
land in New England.

746
01:02:40,517 --> 01:02:42,978
You have no idea how that happened?

747
01:02:43,061 --> 01:02:47,232
- No, sir.
- Does it upset you to learn this?

748
01:02:47,316 --> 01:02:51,069
- Very much so.
- Really? Why?

749
01:02:53,238 --> 01:02:55,699
And one last thing,

750
01:02:55,824 --> 01:02:58,744
unless you know exactly
what the answer is,

751
01:02:58,827 --> 01:03:02,331
never, ever ask a witness "why".

752
01:03:02,456 --> 01:03:04,082
Never.

753
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:11,340
My factory is the oldest
surviving business in Woburn.

754
01:03:11,465 --> 01:03:14,843
When the other tanners moved out,
I stayed,

755
01:03:14,927 --> 01:03:18,305
even though that was
a very big financial burden.

756
01:03:18,388 --> 01:03:20,933
- That's not...
- Woburn is my home...

757
01:03:21,016 --> 01:03:22,643
That's not the question.

758
01:03:22,726 --> 01:03:27,356
He's trying to answer it,
Mr Schlichtmann. Let him.

759
01:03:36,198 --> 01:03:40,953
That land has been in my family
for three generations.

760
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:44,998
That land to me is hallowed ground.

761
01:03:45,082 --> 01:03:49,878
So when you ask me would I be upset

762
01:03:50,003 --> 01:03:52,506
if someone desecrated it -

763
01:03:52,548 --> 01:03:56,552
Iand that's part of the town
that I love -

764
01:03:56,635 --> 01:04:00,055
my answer to your question,
Mr Schlichtmann...

765
01:04:03,517 --> 01:04:05,435
is yes.

766
01:04:22,661 --> 01:04:25,581
I have no further questions,
Your Honour.

767
01:04:29,543 --> 01:04:34,590
The sad part is, they rob themselves
of the blessing of giving.

768
01:04:34,673 --> 01:04:40,345
If somebody wrote a cheque
for the total budget of my church,

769
01:04:40,429 --> 01:04:44,266
it wouldn't affect my giving.

770
01:04:44,391 --> 01:04:48,228
Ain't nobody gonna rob me
of the blessing of giving!

771
01:04:48,312 --> 01:04:52,316
You know why folks ain't getting?
'Cause they ain't giving!

772
01:04:52,399 --> 01:04:57,196
Do not rob yourself
of the blessing of giving.

773
01:04:57,321 --> 01:05:01,825
You'll never guess what I did
last night. You'll like this.

774
01:05:01,909 --> 01:05:06,246
I pledged 200 to a televangelist. I'm
not kidding.

775
01:05:06,330 --> 01:05:09,458
He said,
"Give and ye shall receive."

776
01:05:09,541 --> 01:05:12,211
I know. I know what you're thinking.

777
01:05:12,294 --> 01:05:16,506
You're thinking, Gordon's losing it.
He's falling apart.

778
01:05:16,590 --> 01:05:19,676
He's probably
buying lottery tickets.

779
01:05:21,053 --> 01:05:23,680
I bought a few. I'll admit it.

780
01:05:23,764 --> 01:05:27,434
I know, but seriously,
the jackpot's 45 million.

781
01:05:27,559 --> 01:05:31,396
That's just this week!
You should see the lines out there.

782
01:05:34,358 --> 01:05:38,820
- Is that a gun?
- What?

783
01:05:41,990 --> 01:05:45,744
This? No. No, this is for you.

784
01:05:49,456 --> 01:05:52,292
My Krugerrands.
I've had them forever.

785
01:05:53,752 --> 01:05:56,004
I want you to have them.

786
01:05:56,088 --> 01:05:59,925
And this is the deed to my house.

787
01:06:00,050 --> 01:06:03,720
Here is Conway's
and Crowley's and Jan's.

788
01:06:03,845 --> 01:06:06,181
See, I've come bearing gifts.

789
01:06:11,436 --> 01:06:13,480
We really need the money.

790
01:06:19,486 --> 01:06:22,364
You can tell your child isn't well.

791
01:06:22,447 --> 01:06:27,077
"Has he got a temperature?" "No."
"He's all right, then", they say.

792
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:33,333
"Bring him to the clinic Monday."
He died Monday morning.

793
01:06:33,417 --> 01:06:35,460
Start with Jimmy Anderson -

794
01:06:35,544 --> 01:06:39,131
countless trips to hospital,
futile chemotherapy treatments.

795
01:06:39,256 --> 01:06:44,595
Then the others, ending with Jared
Aufiero, dying on the highway.

796
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:47,723
Could somebody get that?

797
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:53,270
Where is everybody?

798
01:06:53,353 --> 01:06:58,233
You're just noticing now? Gordon
laid everybody off two weeks ago.

799
01:06:58,317 --> 01:07:02,321
Gordon, instead of sitting there
reading a magazine,

800
01:07:02,362 --> 01:07:05,908
why not go to Uncle Pete
and get me a staff?

801
01:07:06,033 --> 01:07:09,119
Good idea.
Why didn't I think of that?

802
01:07:13,415 --> 01:07:14,833
Hello?

803
01:07:27,137 --> 01:07:29,890
There was a Cheeseman
on the Mayflower.

804
01:07:29,973 --> 01:07:32,601
- This way, sir.
- Thank you.

805
01:07:32,684 --> 01:07:34,561
Jan, have a seat.

806
01:07:34,645 --> 01:07:37,814
You want something to drink?
Some coffee? Soda?

807
01:07:37,898 --> 01:07:40,359
You've been talking
without me present?

808
01:07:40,442 --> 01:07:44,488
No, we have been drinking coffee
without your being present.

809
01:07:44,571 --> 01:07:47,241
Don't be so paranoid.
They were early.

810
01:07:50,077 --> 01:07:53,580
- All right. What's up?
- Jerry?

811
01:07:53,664 --> 01:07:56,708
Last night, I was at a ball game.

812
01:07:56,792 --> 01:08:00,629
It was the seventh innings
and I was standing there,

813
01:08:00,754 --> 01:08:04,299
and it occurred to me
at that moment,

814
01:08:04,383 --> 01:08:08,136
unless you've proven that any...
What word should we use?

815
01:08:08,220 --> 01:08:10,138
- Chemicals?
- Poisons.

816
01:08:10,222 --> 01:08:13,267
If you like that word, I'll use it.

817
01:08:13,350 --> 01:08:18,689
Unless you've proven that poisons
reached the wells, there's no case.

818
01:08:18,772 --> 01:08:22,693
And therefore,
no need to make these families,

819
01:08:22,776 --> 01:08:24,653
who've already suffered so much,

820
01:08:24,736 --> 01:08:28,323
relive their suffering
all over again

821
01:08:28,448 --> 01:08:31,869
by putting them on the stand.

822
01:08:33,203 --> 01:08:36,331
- Your Honour, you've...
- That's interesting.

823
01:08:36,415 --> 01:08:39,585
- What?
- I'd have to agree with that.

824
01:08:39,668 --> 01:08:41,295
Your Honour, the...

825
01:08:41,378 --> 01:08:45,507
If the jury decides favourably
on the geological evidence,

826
01:08:45,591 --> 01:08:48,135
you could bring your families in.

827
01:08:48,260 --> 01:08:51,555
Your Honour, the jury
was expecting a human drama.

828
01:08:51,638 --> 01:08:54,850
For three months
they've had lessons in geology.

829
01:08:54,933 --> 01:08:58,312
We had to do that.
Now it's over - finally.

830
01:08:58,395 --> 01:09:02,482
Now we have to see where we are
before moving on,

831
01:09:02,566 --> 01:09:05,903
and subjecting these families
to more trauma than necessary,

832
01:09:05,986 --> 01:09:08,113
because that would just be cruel.

833
01:09:08,197 --> 01:09:11,783
- They want to testify.
- The decision is made.

834
01:09:11,909 --> 01:09:14,870
- It's the defendant's plan.
- It's my plan.

835
01:09:14,953 --> 01:09:17,331
Right from the beginning,
he threatened...

836
01:09:17,456 --> 01:09:19,708
It's MY plan!

837
01:09:27,966 --> 01:09:29,551
Now...

838
01:09:30,427 --> 01:09:36,433
my plan is to present the jury
with some simple questions.

839
01:09:37,809 --> 01:09:40,521
How you answer
these three questions,

840
01:09:40,604 --> 01:09:43,357
will determine whether
this trial continues.

841
01:09:44,858 --> 01:09:47,528
I don't disagree -
I don't understand them.

842
01:09:47,611 --> 01:09:50,280
What don't you understand?
They're straightforward questions.

843
01:09:50,364 --> 01:09:54,034
Have the plaintiffs established,
by preponderance of evidence,

844
01:09:54,117 --> 01:09:59,248
that chemicals containing TCE
were disposed of on these lands

845
01:09:59,331 --> 01:10:06,171
after October 1, 1964
and August 27, 1968, respectively,

846
01:10:06,255 --> 01:10:09,591
and did those chemicals contribute
to the well water contamination?

847
01:10:09,675 --> 01:10:14,304
What were these dates?
Where are they from? Out of a hat?

848
01:10:14,388 --> 01:10:16,139
Question two.

849
01:10:16,223 --> 01:10:19,726
What, according to
a preponderance of the evidence,

850
01:10:19,810 --> 01:10:23,272
was the earliest time
at which these chemicals

851
01:10:23,355 --> 01:10:26,775
substantially contributed
to the wells' contamination?

852
01:10:26,859 --> 01:10:28,485
How can they determine that?

853
01:10:28,569 --> 01:10:32,239
Science can't even determine
when the chemicals arrived

854
01:10:32,322 --> 01:10:35,576
with the precision
that you're asking of the jurors.

855
01:10:35,659 --> 01:10:37,452
And finally, three.

856
01:10:37,536 --> 01:10:40,163
What, according to
a preponderance of the evidence,

857
01:10:40,247 --> 01:10:43,250
was the earliest time -
again, month and year -

858
01:10:43,333 --> 01:10:46,378
at which substantial contribution
referred to in question two

859
01:10:46,461 --> 01:10:48,755
was caused, if it was,

860
01:10:48,839 --> 01:10:52,342
by the negligent conduct
of the defendants?

861
01:10:52,426 --> 01:10:55,721
It's like English translated into
Japanese back into English again.

862
01:10:55,804 --> 01:10:57,264
I've heard enough.

863
01:10:57,347 --> 01:11:00,434
Your Honour,
no one can answer these.

864
01:11:00,517 --> 01:11:02,978
You're asking for answers
that are unknowable.

865
01:11:03,061 --> 01:11:04,521
I've heard enough.

866
01:11:04,605 --> 01:11:08,358
You're asking for a fiction
that stands for truth, but isn't.

867
01:11:08,442 --> 01:11:09,443
Enough!

868
01:11:10,736 --> 01:11:16,700
Once again, I remind you not
to discuss your views outside,

869
01:11:16,783 --> 01:11:19,161
and excuse you...

870
01:11:21,872 --> 01:11:24,958
Don't worry about it.
Everything's under control.

871
01:11:25,918 --> 01:11:31,673
And excuse you
to your deliberations. Thank you.

872
01:12:56,425 --> 01:12:58,677
I've never done this.

873
01:12:58,719 --> 01:13:00,721
In 45 years of practising,

874
01:13:00,804 --> 01:13:04,266
I've never
waited in a corridor for a jury.

875
01:13:04,349 --> 01:13:07,311
- I always do.
- I can tell.

876
01:13:07,394 --> 01:13:10,189
You're good at it.

877
01:13:10,230 --> 01:13:12,608
You seem so at peace doing it.

878
01:13:17,446 --> 01:13:21,533
What do you think?
ls it good they're out this long?

879
01:13:21,617 --> 01:13:24,786
- For who?
- For me, of course.

880
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:30,375
You can never tell.
It could mean anything.

881
01:13:30,459 --> 01:13:34,838
It could mean jury duty's more fun
than working at the post office.

882
01:13:36,757 --> 01:13:40,969
- It's bad for both of you.
- You think?

883
01:13:42,554 --> 01:13:44,598
Well, here's my take.

884
01:13:46,016 --> 01:13:48,143
Guilty.

885
01:13:49,311 --> 01:13:53,148
Not guilty.
That's what they're going to say.

886
01:13:53,273 --> 01:13:56,652
Nothing to do with dates
or ground-water measurements

887
01:13:56,735 --> 01:14:01,198
or any of that crap,
which nobody understands anyway.

888
01:14:01,281 --> 01:14:05,035
It's going to come down to people,
like always.

889
01:14:05,118 --> 01:14:08,872
You found someone
who saw him dumping stuff.

890
01:14:08,997 --> 01:14:12,751
You didn't find anyone who saw me.

891
01:14:15,712 --> 01:14:18,882
- What's your take?
- They'll see the truth.

892
01:14:18,966 --> 01:14:20,717
The truth?

893
01:14:22,010 --> 01:14:25,305
We're talking about a court of law.

894
01:14:25,389 --> 01:14:28,600
You've been around
long enough to know

895
01:14:28,684 --> 01:14:31,770
courtrooms aren't
where you look for the truth.

896
01:14:31,854 --> 01:14:35,983
You're lucky to find anything
that even resembles the truth.

897
01:14:38,944 --> 01:14:43,198
You disagree. Well, since when?

898
01:14:44,366 --> 01:14:46,368
Eight kids are dead, Jerry.

899
01:14:48,579 --> 01:14:53,083
Jan, that suit fits you better
than the sentimentality.

900
01:14:53,166 --> 01:14:56,920
That's not how you
made all that money, is it?

901
01:14:57,004 --> 01:15:02,050
It wasn't about dead children from
the minute you filed the complaint.

902
01:15:02,134 --> 01:15:06,972
The minute it entered
the justice system. Oh, yes.

903
01:15:11,351 --> 01:15:13,645
I know you like to gamble.

904
01:15:13,770 --> 01:15:16,231
High-stakes gambler,
that's your profession.

905
01:15:16,315 --> 01:15:20,360
Why not test your faith
in the righteousness of our courts

906
01:15:20,444 --> 01:15:22,988
with a high-stakes gamble?

907
01:15:27,242 --> 01:15:30,746
If that's a settlement offer,
Jerry, it's not enough.

908
01:15:30,829 --> 01:15:34,249
- That's not what I hear.
- Who said that?

909
01:15:34,374 --> 01:15:39,171
The IRS, telling us they have
a lien on any eventual settlement

910
01:15:39,296 --> 01:15:43,467
in order to recover
over 2.5 million in unpaid taxes.

911
01:15:46,595 --> 01:15:48,555
But all right...

912
01:15:48,639 --> 01:15:54,061
What if I would add
six zeros onto that?

913
01:15:54,144 --> 01:15:59,107
That would be - what? - 20 million.

914
01:16:00,275 --> 01:16:03,320
Now, that would put things
in perspective, wouldn't it?

915
01:16:03,403 --> 01:16:06,907
As far as truth, justice
and dead children go?

916
01:16:06,990 --> 01:16:09,826
If you want to talk
about a settlement,

917
01:16:09,910 --> 01:16:13,080
get the decision-makers together
and talk seriously.

918
01:16:13,163 --> 01:16:15,791
The decision-makers are here,
aren't they?

919
01:16:15,874 --> 01:16:17,793
You're looking at Mr Beatrice.

920
01:16:17,876 --> 01:16:21,338
I don't have to call anybody. Do you?

921
01:16:24,883 --> 01:16:27,886
It's just you and me.

922
01:16:27,928 --> 01:16:31,765
We're like kings. We are kings.

923
01:16:32,850 --> 01:16:35,519
Sitting in our castle,
deciding important things.

924
01:16:35,602 --> 01:16:38,146
Deciding the fates of others.

925
01:16:38,272 --> 01:16:41,400
And counting money.
In our counting room!

926
01:16:56,915 --> 01:17:00,294
Tell you what. I'll leave this here,

927
01:17:00,377 --> 01:17:03,755
go back down the hall
to my throne room

928
01:17:03,839 --> 01:17:06,508
and await your decision.

929
01:17:12,639 --> 01:17:15,100
If you really want the truth, Jan,

930
01:17:15,184 --> 01:17:21,106
Iook for it where it is -
at the bottom of a bottomless pit.

931
01:18:28,090 --> 01:18:32,010
Mr Foreman, members of the jury, have
you reached a verdict?

932
01:18:32,094 --> 01:18:33,929
Yes, Your Honour.

933
01:18:47,734 --> 01:18:53,073
With respect to W.R. Grace,
the jury has answered...

934
01:18:53,156 --> 01:18:57,744
"yes" to question one regarding
trichlorethylene contamination,

935
01:18:57,828 --> 01:19:00,372
requiring the case against Grace

936
01:19:00,414 --> 01:19:03,083
to go to a second stage
of this trial.

937
01:19:04,334 --> 01:19:11,508
In regard to Beatrice, the jury
has answered "no" to question one

938
01:19:11,592 --> 01:19:14,970
in all its points
pertaining to contamination

939
01:19:15,053 --> 01:19:19,057
which renders questions two
and three inapplicable,

940
01:19:19,141 --> 01:19:21,101
ending the case against Beatrice.

941
01:19:21,185 --> 01:19:25,314
- Mr Facher, you're excused.
- Thank you, Your Honour.

942
01:19:26,815 --> 01:19:33,614
We are going to take
a break now, until after lunch.

943
01:19:33,697 --> 01:19:37,451
Once again, I remind you
not to talk to anyone

944
01:19:37,576 --> 01:19:39,703
about your deliberations here...

945
01:19:52,216 --> 01:19:56,970
Disappointed?
Not at all. This is a victory.

946
01:19:57,054 --> 01:20:01,725
This sends a message that companies
can no longer get away with this.

947
01:20:01,808 --> 01:20:04,353
- So what now?
- Right now?

948
01:20:04,478 --> 01:20:08,065
I think we should celebrate.
What do you think? Yes?

949
01:20:08,148 --> 01:20:13,278
You'll proceed against Grace,
no matter how long it takes?

950
01:20:14,821 --> 01:20:18,742
We have to
get out of this case fast.

951
01:20:18,867 --> 01:20:20,911
That's our only strategy left.

952
01:20:22,412 --> 01:20:25,666
The good news is
Grace wants to talk.

953
01:20:25,749 --> 01:20:30,087
They want us to see their executive
vice-president, AI Eustis.

954
01:20:30,170 --> 01:20:33,799
So we need to know
what our squeal point is.

955
01:20:34,883 --> 01:20:39,179
8 million. 8 million
will just about get us out of hock.

956
01:20:40,806 --> 01:20:43,684
Gordon knows the numbers.

957
01:20:50,899 --> 01:20:55,028
Jan, every dollar we spend
is a dollar we don't have.

958
01:20:55,112 --> 01:20:58,115
We are floating on credit
without a net.

959
01:20:58,198 --> 01:21:02,244
I don't need a net.
Mortgage my house. I don't care.

960
01:21:03,036 --> 01:21:08,417
I have.
And Kevin's and Bill's and mine.

961
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:13,881
I've cashed in our retirement plans
and life-insurance. And it's gone.

962
01:21:13,964 --> 01:21:16,592
Let me put it this way,

963
01:21:16,675 --> 01:21:22,848
if we can't appear we've got money
they won't give us 8 million.

964
01:21:22,931 --> 01:21:26,768
They won't give us eight cents.
You know that.

965
01:21:26,894 --> 01:21:28,937
You all know that.

966
01:21:37,613 --> 01:21:39,656
It's our nicest suite.

967
01:21:39,740 --> 01:21:45,204
Living room, dining room,
two bedrooms, a den, a lovely view.

968
01:21:45,287 --> 01:21:47,331
It's 2,400 a night.

969
01:21:49,541 --> 01:21:51,376
For our inner strength.

970
01:21:52,377 --> 01:21:55,422
- On the card.
- Why not?

971
01:21:58,175 --> 01:22:00,385
Farmers' Bank of lowa.

972
01:22:22,824 --> 01:22:24,243
Hey, there!

973
01:22:24,326 --> 01:22:26,578
- Jan Schlichtmann.
- AI Eustis.

974
01:22:26,662 --> 01:22:29,790
How are you?
Sorry I'm late. I got lost.

975
01:22:29,873 --> 01:22:32,000
- Got lost?
- Yes.

976
01:22:32,084 --> 01:22:33,961
How did you manage that?

977
01:22:34,044 --> 01:22:36,129
I've never been here before so...

978
01:22:36,213 --> 01:22:39,091
What kind of Harvard man are you?

979
01:22:40,217 --> 01:22:42,344
The Cornell kind.

980
01:22:42,427 --> 01:22:48,100
Cornell?
I thought you went to Harvard?

981
01:22:48,183 --> 01:22:53,647
I'm sure somebody said that
you went to Harvard! Cornell!

982
01:22:53,730 --> 01:22:55,691
Yes.

983
01:22:55,774 --> 01:22:58,861
Well, listen, Cornell is...
is a damn good school.

984
01:22:59,444 --> 01:23:02,322
Damn good.

985
01:23:02,364 --> 01:23:04,408
So what do you want?

986
01:23:05,492 --> 01:23:09,162
Well, I could take you
through it step by step

987
01:23:09,288 --> 01:23:13,417
or you could take
this with you and study it.

988
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:15,419
It's a little complicated but...

989
01:23:15,502 --> 01:23:18,714
It's an unspoken rule
of the Harvard Club -

990
01:23:18,797 --> 01:23:22,092
business is never transacted here.

991
01:23:22,134 --> 01:23:25,387
I meant, what do you want to drink?

992
01:23:26,930 --> 01:23:31,351
I wanted to reach across
and strangle him with his tie.

993
01:23:31,435 --> 01:23:33,729
Instead, I sat there for two hours

994
01:23:33,854 --> 01:23:38,025
and listened to him
talk about selling his yacht.

995
01:23:38,108 --> 01:23:43,906
You know, sometimes
I actually prefer the 35-footer.

996
01:23:43,989 --> 01:23:46,325
Because I can crew it myself,

997
01:23:46,408 --> 01:23:51,079
I can be all by myself out there
alone. It's magnificent.

998
01:23:51,163 --> 01:23:54,833
And there's no... Nobody can
call you. Nobody can beep you.

999
01:23:54,958 --> 01:23:57,044
Nobody can fax you.

1000
01:23:57,127 --> 01:23:59,338
There's no lawsuits.

1001
01:23:59,463 --> 01:24:02,507
You know what I'm talking about.
You sail?

1002
01:24:02,591 --> 01:24:05,636
- No.
- You don't sail?

1003
01:24:07,012 --> 01:24:11,225
- Finally, we went to his office.
- Let's sit down.

1004
01:24:11,308 --> 01:24:15,145
Come on. It's more comfortable.
Have a seat.

1005
01:24:15,270 --> 01:24:18,565
He comes around the desk,
he sits down.

1006
01:24:20,734 --> 01:24:22,236
Go ahead, sit down.

1007
01:24:22,319 --> 01:24:25,989
He puts his feet up
on this French antique thing

1008
01:24:26,823 --> 01:24:30,202
and he tells me to put my feet up.

1009
01:24:30,285 --> 01:24:32,746
Put your feet up. Come on.

1010
01:24:32,829 --> 01:24:35,916
- No, thank you.
- No, go ahead.

1011
01:24:35,999 --> 01:24:38,961
- Go ahead.
- No, really, I'm fine.

1012
01:24:39,044 --> 01:24:42,256
Nothing's going to break.
Put them up.

1013
01:24:42,339 --> 01:24:46,552
It was weird - all this talk about
putting my feet on this table.

1014
01:24:46,635 --> 01:24:49,680
It's all right - I mean it.
Try it. Come on.

1015
01:24:49,763 --> 01:24:51,598
Put your feet up.

1016
01:25:00,524 --> 01:25:07,030
There. Now, I can afford to pay you
almost anything you ask.

1017
01:25:07,114 --> 01:25:09,658
It's not the money.

1018
01:25:09,741 --> 01:25:12,661
But a settlement that high
says we're guilty.

1019
01:25:12,744 --> 01:25:16,915
That says to every two-bit
personal injury lawyer in Boston,

1020
01:25:16,999 --> 01:25:19,209
Iet's sign up everyone in Woburn.

1021
01:25:19,293 --> 01:25:22,796
Creates a shark effect,
and that I can't afford.

1022
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:24,840
Give me a number.

1023
01:25:26,300 --> 01:25:28,594
I'm not negotiating with myself, Al,

1024
01:25:28,719 --> 01:25:32,097
throwing out numbers
you can say no to.

1025
01:25:32,181 --> 01:25:34,725
- You give me one.
- 8 million.

1026
01:25:37,811 --> 01:25:41,648
He said 8 million?

1027
01:25:41,732 --> 01:25:43,192
8 million.

1028
01:25:45,068 --> 01:25:47,738
I can't go to the families
with that.

1029
01:25:47,821 --> 01:25:50,115
Wait! What? Who? What families?

1030
01:25:50,199 --> 01:25:52,951
I can't go to them empty-handed.

1031
01:25:53,035 --> 01:25:54,995
What are you talking about?

1032
01:25:55,078 --> 01:25:59,750
Since when is that empty-handed?
8 million is a lot of money!

1033
01:26:01,376 --> 01:26:03,420
I owe them more than that.

1034
01:26:03,503 --> 01:26:06,048
What do you owe them?

1035
01:26:06,173 --> 01:26:08,383
Do you owe them your career?

1036
01:26:08,467 --> 01:26:10,594
You're talking
about our careers here!

1037
01:26:10,677 --> 01:26:13,931
- You owe them that?
- And OUR families!

1038
01:26:14,014 --> 01:26:15,891
That's what we're talking here.

1039
01:26:15,974 --> 01:26:18,435
Our families...

1040
01:26:18,477 --> 01:26:20,896
Don't do it.

1041
01:26:23,524 --> 01:26:26,068
Don't go for broke on this one.

1042
01:26:26,151 --> 01:26:28,779
It isn't worth it, Jan.

1043
01:26:53,679 --> 01:26:57,850
Nobody calls any more?
Not even the creditors.

1044
01:26:59,351 --> 01:27:01,186
Are the phones still working?

1045
01:27:10,612 --> 01:27:12,656
Schlichtmann, Conway and Crowley.

1046
01:27:15,492 --> 01:27:17,327
Just a moment, please.

1047
01:27:18,287 --> 01:27:19,872
Someone named Grendan.

1048
01:27:19,955 --> 01:27:21,623
Creditor.

1049
01:27:21,707 --> 01:27:26,378
- Are you here?
- Do I look like I'm here?

1050
01:27:28,005 --> 01:27:30,299
He's in a meeting at the moment.

1051
01:27:30,424 --> 01:27:33,510
Do me a favour, Gordon? Shut up.

1052
01:27:35,470 --> 01:27:36,930
What?

1053
01:27:37,014 --> 01:27:40,559
I'm tired of hearing you
moan about money.

1054
01:27:40,642 --> 01:27:42,769
This isn't about money any more.

1055
01:27:42,895 --> 01:27:46,648
No? What's it about?

1056
01:27:48,483 --> 01:27:49,943
What's it about, Jan?

1057
01:27:50,027 --> 01:27:53,780
- Look, let's all...
- No, I want to know.

1058
01:27:53,906 --> 01:27:59,870
I want to know what I gave up
my house for - my credit, my life!

1059
01:27:59,953 --> 01:28:02,080
Would you take 10 million?

1060
01:28:02,164 --> 01:28:04,291
- Yes.
- But not eight?

1061
01:28:04,374 --> 01:28:05,375
No.

1062
01:28:05,500 --> 01:28:09,338
So 10 million
is some mythic struggle,

1063
01:28:09,463 --> 01:28:11,757
but eight is just another lawsuit!

1064
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:15,427
If they're willing to pay eight
then it's not enough.

1065
01:28:15,552 --> 01:28:18,847
- That makes sense!
- It makes perfect sense.

1066
01:28:18,931 --> 01:28:22,351
So you'll only accept
what they won't give us?

1067
01:28:22,434 --> 01:28:24,061
Listen to yourself!

1068
01:28:24,144 --> 01:28:29,358
I'm sick of listening to you.
I've lost enough because of you.

1069
01:28:29,483 --> 01:28:34,238
You'd have nothing but for me.
All you have, I got for you!

1070
01:28:34,321 --> 01:28:38,158
I don't have anything!
What do I have?

1071
01:28:38,283 --> 01:28:42,412
I got a couple of bucks
and some bus transfers.

1072
01:28:42,496 --> 01:28:47,209
I've got a savings account
from when I was 12.

1073
01:28:47,292 --> 01:28:49,753
Here - there's 37 in here.

1074
01:28:49,836 --> 01:28:52,506
With interest after 25 years,
probably 47!

1075
01:28:52,589 --> 01:28:55,342
Take it! Add it to the war chest.

1076
01:28:55,425 --> 01:28:57,469
Use it to fight injustice!

1077
01:28:57,553 --> 01:29:01,849
Go down in flames with it
for all I care.

1078
01:29:01,932 --> 01:29:04,935
Only next time...
Next time - that's a laugh!

1079
01:29:05,018 --> 01:29:09,106
Ask us if we want
to go down with you!

1080
01:30:18,759 --> 01:30:21,845
I'd like to leave a message
for AI Eustis, please.

1081
01:30:28,852 --> 01:30:33,148
I've been informed that a settlement
agreement has been reached.

1082
01:30:33,232 --> 01:30:35,234
As a condition of this agreement,

1083
01:30:35,317 --> 01:30:39,238
the exact terms shall remain
private among the parties involved.

1084
01:30:40,405 --> 01:30:42,783
Thank you for your service...

1085
01:30:42,908 --> 01:30:46,828
Our contingency fee,
as you know, as you agreed to -

1086
01:30:55,921 --> 01:30:58,298
or 2.2 million.

1087
01:30:58,423 --> 01:31:02,928
Our expenses - what we actually
paid out trying this case -

1088
01:31:03,011 --> 01:31:04,930
comes to 3.5 million.

1089
01:31:11,854 --> 01:31:17,776
and dividing it equally,
comes out to 375,000 per family.

1090
01:31:27,953 --> 01:31:29,997
And they're
gonna clean the place up?

1091
01:31:31,540 --> 01:31:33,166
No.

1092
01:31:36,795 --> 01:31:39,339
When you first came out here,
Mr Schlichtmann,

1093
01:31:39,423 --> 01:31:46,013
when we first spoke, I told you
I wasn't interested in money.

1094
01:31:46,096 --> 01:31:47,931
Here it comes.

1095
01:31:48,015 --> 01:31:51,226
What I wanted
was an apology from someone

1096
01:31:51,310 --> 01:31:54,021
for what they did to my son.

1097
01:31:55,147 --> 01:31:57,983
And you said, money is the apology.

1098
01:31:58,066 --> 01:32:02,154
That's how they apologise -
with their chequebooks.

1099
01:32:05,115 --> 01:32:07,659
Would you call this an apology?

1100
01:32:09,494 --> 01:32:10,954
No.

1101
01:32:11,038 --> 01:32:15,334
The only meaningful apology
you're going to get is from me.

1102
01:32:15,417 --> 01:32:17,169
I'm sorry.

1103
01:32:20,964 --> 01:32:23,634
I'm afraid that isn't meaningful.

1104
01:32:25,302 --> 01:32:29,515
Mrs Anderson, you're looking
at four guys who are broke.

1105
01:32:29,598 --> 01:32:31,517
We lost everything trying this case.

1106
01:32:33,519 --> 01:32:37,648
How can you even begin
to compare what you've lost

1107
01:32:37,731 --> 01:32:39,775
to what we've lost?

1108
01:33:24,361 --> 01:33:28,866
Listen, the minute you put money
on the table, things turn ugly.

1109
01:33:28,949 --> 01:33:31,410
It happens every time. Forget it.

1110
01:33:31,493 --> 01:33:33,745
But she's right.

1111
01:33:34,913 --> 01:33:36,957
She's not right.

1112
01:33:39,126 --> 01:33:43,881
It's cold. It's wet. We're
in the swamp. I want to go home.

1113
01:33:43,964 --> 01:33:46,717
Someone out here saw what happened.

1114
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:50,345
You can't do what Riley did
without somebody seeing it.

1115
01:33:51,930 --> 01:33:54,183
You're talking about the case.

1116
01:33:54,266 --> 01:33:56,226
The case is over.

1117
01:34:06,945 --> 01:34:09,781
Yeah, I know. They want out, right?

1118
01:34:09,865 --> 01:34:12,618
It's time they went
their separate way.

1119
01:34:12,701 --> 01:34:15,037
You know what I think of that?

1120
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:17,915
Fine. Let 'em.

1121
01:34:17,956 --> 01:34:22,085
- I can imagine worse things.
- Like what?

1122
01:34:22,169 --> 01:34:24,922
So what if we have to start over?

1123
01:34:25,005 --> 01:34:29,885
We did it once.
We can do it again, the two of us.

1124
01:34:38,352 --> 01:34:44,566
Oh, I see. When you say it's over,
you mean it's over.

1125
01:34:46,235 --> 01:34:49,321
It's time for me
to go my separate way.

1126
01:34:52,908 --> 01:34:55,577
You always went
your separate way, Jan.

1127
01:35:58,557 --> 01:36:00,184
Thank you.

1128
01:36:58,450 --> 01:37:03,455
This is how silicone is
put on leather to waterproof it.

1129
01:37:03,539 --> 01:37:06,917
Like you poured water on my table.

1130
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,044
Yeah.

1131
01:37:16,927 --> 01:37:20,597
So some of it must
spill off the leather,

1132
01:37:20,681 --> 01:37:23,642
Iike the water
spilling off my table.

1133
01:37:27,604 --> 01:37:30,148
That's the part I'm interested in.

1134
01:37:30,274 --> 01:37:33,277
The spilled silicone
and trichlorethylene, sir -

1135
01:37:33,360 --> 01:37:35,404
how you disposed of that.

1136
01:37:46,999 --> 01:37:50,002
We're just here
to look at your records.

1137
01:38:06,393 --> 01:38:09,146
I didn't call him, he just came.

1138
01:38:09,229 --> 01:38:14,276
- You just let him in?
- Of course I did.

1139
01:38:36,131 --> 01:38:39,718
You know how sometimes
you get so close to something

1140
01:38:39,843 --> 01:38:41,887
that you lose sight of it?

1141
01:38:45,682 --> 01:38:48,560
I kept looking for someone

1142
01:38:48,644 --> 01:38:52,064
who saw Riley dumping
barrels of poison, when l...

1143
01:38:52,147 --> 01:38:56,610
I should've been looking for someone
who helped him clean it up.

1144
01:39:04,076 --> 01:39:09,414
Why did you rent two dump trucks
and a front loader in October '81?

1145
01:39:09,498 --> 01:39:13,418
Or is this just
part of your job at the tannery?

1146
01:39:15,212 --> 01:39:19,258
- Mr Granger?
- I don't have to talk to you.

1147
01:39:19,341 --> 01:39:24,012
I can tell you to leave
and I'd be within my rights.

1148
01:39:24,096 --> 01:39:26,473
Yes, you would.

1149
01:39:38,735 --> 01:39:43,699
In the fall of 1981, Mr Riley
instructed me to rent a loader

1150
01:39:43,824 --> 01:39:47,244
and two 10-wheel dump trucks.

1151
01:39:47,327 --> 01:39:51,164
- Did he tell you why?
- Yes, he did.

1152
01:39:51,290 --> 01:39:55,627
Everything goes. I don't want
to see anything but topsoil.

1153
01:39:55,711 --> 01:40:01,216
Didn't it seem strange
that he had to get rid of it now?

1154
01:40:01,300 --> 01:40:04,678
I don't want to know where.
Just take it.

1155
01:40:04,761 --> 01:40:07,431
He told me city inspectors
were coming.

1156
01:40:07,514 --> 01:40:09,975
He didn't want them to see it.

1157
01:40:15,272 --> 01:40:17,733
This went on for several nights.

1158
01:40:17,816 --> 01:40:19,860
Fill the trucks, trucks drive off,

1159
01:40:19,943 --> 01:40:24,031
trucks come back empty,
we fill them up again.

1160
01:40:25,741 --> 01:40:27,784
On the last night...

1161
01:40:27,868 --> 01:40:30,078
On the last night, what?

1162
01:40:31,788 --> 01:40:34,833
Are you sure you didn't
see some kids there?

1163
01:40:34,917 --> 01:40:38,670
- Lighting fires, drinking beers?
- I've nothing to say.

1164
01:40:38,754 --> 01:40:42,090
It'd be hard to forget.
You know, it's a...

1165
01:40:42,174 --> 01:40:44,218
Apparently, it was quite a sight.

1166
01:40:47,971 --> 01:40:49,223
Go, go, go.

1167
01:40:49,348 --> 01:40:51,892
Watch out!

1168
01:40:52,017 --> 01:40:55,020
This is private property!
You little punks!

1169
01:40:55,103 --> 01:40:56,563
That's you!

1170
01:40:56,647 --> 01:41:01,151
You know, mister, I'm sorry.
Here's something to make up for it.

1171
01:41:01,235 --> 01:41:03,362
There you go! There - fry!

1172
01:41:05,030 --> 01:41:07,032
I'll have you arrested!

1173
01:41:07,115 --> 01:41:11,411
It's like that now!
You want some of that? Eat it!

1174
01:41:28,262 --> 01:41:31,098
Let's go! Let's go!

1175
01:41:32,933 --> 01:41:35,894
- Get the fuck out!
- Come on.

1176
01:41:46,154 --> 01:41:48,699
Did Riley threaten you at all

1177
01:41:48,824 --> 01:41:52,953
with what might happen to you
if you ever came forward?

1178
01:41:53,036 --> 01:41:54,621
No, sir.

1179
01:41:54,705 --> 01:41:58,458
He didn't say anything
at all in this regard?

1180
01:42:02,963 --> 01:42:06,049
He gave me
a couple of Celtics tickets.

1181
01:42:06,133 --> 01:42:08,802
Told me to keep my mouth shut.

1182
01:42:45,714 --> 01:42:48,550
The appeals process
is even more Byzantine

1183
01:42:48,634 --> 01:42:50,636
than the trial it's appealing.

1184
01:42:52,804 --> 01:42:55,140
It takes longer, it costs more,

1185
01:42:55,224 --> 01:42:57,893
its outcome is even less promising.

1186
01:42:59,102 --> 01:43:02,940
Only five cases in 50
will win in appeals court,

1187
01:43:03,023 --> 01:43:06,777
odds as easy to calculate
as they are discouraging.

1188
01:43:06,860 --> 01:43:09,154
They're 10 to 1 against.

1189
01:43:09,279 --> 01:43:12,115
Just about any bet at any table

1190
01:43:12,199 --> 01:43:14,993
in any casino
anywhere in the world...

1191
01:43:15,077 --> 01:43:16,912
is better than that.

1192
01:43:20,123 --> 01:43:24,253
I have the evidence but not the
resources or the gambling spirit

1193
01:43:24,336 --> 01:43:27,714
to appeal the decision in this case.

1194
01:43:29,049 --> 01:43:31,260
I have no money, no partners,

1195
01:43:31,385 --> 01:43:34,388
and, it seems, no clients any more.

1196
01:43:36,306 --> 01:43:40,519
The Woburn case has become what it
was when it first came to me -

1197
01:43:40,561 --> 01:43:42,396
an orphan.

1198
01:43:42,479 --> 01:43:45,816
I'm forwarding it on to you,

1199
01:43:45,858 --> 01:43:50,404
knowing you may not want it
any more than I did at first.

1200
01:43:51,530 --> 01:43:54,449
If you do decide to take it on,

1201
01:43:54,533 --> 01:43:58,287
I hope you'll be able to succeed
where I've failed.

1202
01:43:58,412 --> 01:44:02,249
If you calculate success
and failure as I always have,

1203
01:44:02,332 --> 01:44:05,711
in money divided neatly
into human suffering,

1204
01:44:05,752 --> 01:44:08,380
the arithmetic says...

1205
01:44:08,463 --> 01:44:10,507
I failed completely.

1206
01:44:12,092 --> 01:44:15,929
What it doesn't say
is if I could go back,

1207
01:44:16,054 --> 01:44:21,768
knowing what I know now and where
I'd end up if I got involved,

1208
01:44:21,852 --> 01:44:24,813
knowing all the numbers,
all the odds,

1209
01:44:24,897 --> 01:44:26,940
all the angles...

1210
01:44:32,487 --> 01:44:34,740
I'd do it again.

1211
01:45:24,039 --> 01:45:25,707
Sorry.

1212
01:46:26,894 --> 01:46:28,520
Jesus!

1213
01:47:31,792 --> 01:47:33,377
I'm sorry. Yes?

1214
01:47:33,460 --> 01:47:37,548
The purpose of these questions
is not to humiliate you,

1215
01:47:37,631 --> 01:47:40,717
but to verify
the assets that you've declared.

1216
01:47:40,801 --> 01:47:42,344
I understand.

1217
01:47:42,427 --> 01:47:47,891
Because what you're asking
your creditors to believe is...

1218
01:47:47,933 --> 01:47:51,812
- Well, it's hard to believe.
- I know.

1219
01:47:51,937 --> 01:47:57,734
After 17 years of practising law,
all you have to show for it is...

1220
01:47:57,818 --> 01:48:01,321
14 dollars in a chequing account
and a portable radio?

1221
01:48:01,405 --> 01:48:03,282
That's correct.

1222
01:48:08,412 --> 01:48:10,372
Where did it all go?

1223
01:48:11,498 --> 01:48:12,583
The money?

1224
01:48:12,666 --> 01:48:17,629
The money, the property,
the personal belongings.

1225
01:48:17,754 --> 01:48:22,342
The things one acquires
in one's life, Mr Schlichtmann.

1226
01:48:24,011 --> 01:48:28,223
The things by which
one measures one's life.

1227
01:48:44,990 --> 01:48:47,117
What happened?

1228
01:48:48,117 --> 01:48:58,117
