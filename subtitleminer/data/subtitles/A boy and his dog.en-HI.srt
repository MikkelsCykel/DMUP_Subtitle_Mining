ability to hunt for food
when you learned how to talk!

137

Pull on it!  Pull....

151
00:12:11,259 --> 00:12:17,027
Get out of there, hey you junkies,
get that dirt out of there.

152
00:12:18,609 --> 00:12:22,374
Must be something special.
You got the whole bunch.

153
00:12:23,035 --> 00:12:28,051
You get up and get
in that hole.  Get up!

154

You get yourself up or you

here...he' smart, that's how.

156
00:12:44,343 --> 00:12:47,106

<i><b>Dog:  Hmmm, probably just charisma.</b></i>

158

160
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,823
Move your foot if you don't

161
00:13:14,424 --> 00:13:16,766
Where'd you...it?  Maybe

162

<i><b>Dog:  God, I wish he'd tune that.</b></i>

00:14:30,885 --> 00:14:31,556
I don't know.

169
00:14:31,556 --> 00:14:33,558
Chet got Cracker Jack to here.

170
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,560
Think he just might do.

171
00:14:36,563 --> 00:14:37,815
Maybe.

173

You all right.  I need
shoes. Anybody see some shoes?

177
00:15:12,581 --> 00:15:15,375
Hey you pigs get down there and dig.

178
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:18,428
This place ought to be
loaded.  Get it out of there.

179
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,680

180

<i><b>Dog:  We'll wait like we always do.</b></i>

181

00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:29,122
<i><b>Dog:  Vic, come back here!</b></i>

183

184
00:15:51,683 --> 00:15:56,108
<i>Get back down in here, you

185
00:15:57,281 --> 00:15:59,533
Leave him go.

186
00:15:59,704 --> 00:16:03,198
Oh shut up.  At least
he's got some guts.

187
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:07,474
Get out of here and guard that wagon.

188
00:16:07,975 --> 00:16:10,988
<i>He got our bag. Run boy!</i>

189
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:18,588
<i>Come back any time, though.</i>

190
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,593

191
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:33,048
That's our boy.  Put out the cheese.

192
00:16:47,667 --> 00:16:50,671
What do you want to do tonight?

193
00:16:50,672 --> 00:16:52,734
<i><b>Dog:  Oh, doesn't really matter to me.</b></i>

194
00:16:52,734 --> 00:16:56,108
Whatever you would like
to do, Albert...uh, Vic.

195
00:17:04,129 --> 00:17:09,646
Well, hell, now that we're loaded,
I guess we could hit the turf.

196
00:17:10,478 --> 00:17:13,322
<i><b>Dog:  Yes, we could do that.</b></i>

197
00:17:14,744 --> 00:17:15,824
Well if you rather not...

198
00:17:15,825 --> 00:17:20,581
<i><b>Dog:  Oh no, no, no,
that would be fine.</b></i>

199
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:25,767
We could probably even
afford a little pop..popcorn.

200
00:17:46,746 --> 00:17:50,170
Mats good for the rifle,
put in the water there.

201
00:17:50,592 --> 00:17:53,846
They’re getting wet there; move
them over, goes to rust fast.

202
00:17:54,016 --> 00:17:55,017
Move on along.

203
00:17:56,269 --> 00:17:59,273
You money grabbing toad,
you move my stuff over!

204
00:17:59,273 --> 00:18:02,286
Move his heat; we don't
want no trouble tonight.

205
00:18:08,305 --> 00:18:10,197
If it picks up one rust spot,

206
00:18:10,197 --> 00:18:12,310
you're going to wake up
with a crowd around you.

207
00:18:27,521 --> 00:18:28,441
Sardines...

208
00:18:28,442 --> 00:18:29,523
We could use some.

209
00:18:31,275 --> 00:18:33,197
What about the mutt.

210
00:18:33,198 --> 00:18:34,199
He ain't no mutt.

211
00:18:34,199 --> 00:18:36,201
You wanna see the movies or don't you.

212
00:18:52,253 --> 00:18:53,084
Peaches.

213
00:18:58,522 --> 00:19:00,273
How the hell am I
supposed to know that?

214
00:19:00,775 --> 00:19:02,526
You can read, can't you?

215
00:19:05,872 --> 00:19:08,625
Peaches for the dog.

216
00:19:08,966 --> 00:19:10,387
Beets are better for him any way.

217
00:19:14,563 --> 00:19:16,565
There's a screamer 'bout a mile out.

218
00:19:16,566 --> 00:19:17,987
Where's he heading?

219
00:19:17,988 --> 00:19:20,412
You think I'd stick around to
find out?  I said screamers.

She might get away.
I'll buy you the popcorn.

It's not.  My mother says it's
not that unusual back in Oklahoma.

303
00:33:23,515 --> 00:33:26,359
<i><b>Dog:  Rover pack.  23 strong.
They got the building surrounded.</b></i>

304
00:33:26,359 --> 00:33:29,112
Great, some other mutt must
have smelled her in the theater.

305
00:33:29,113 --> 00:33:30,284
Who are you talking too?

306
00:33:30,285 --> 00:33:30,865
Him.

307
00:33:31,455 --> 00:33:32,116
The dog?

308
00:33:32,537 --> 00:33:33,368
<i><b>Dog:  Give them the girl.</b></i>

309
00:33:34,129 --> 00:33:35,631
Dig in and stand them off.

310
00:33:35,712 --> 00:33:36,482
<i><b>Dog:  They don't know about us.</b></i>

311
00:33:36,483 --> 00:33:38,195
Just give them the girl
and let's get out of here.

312
00:33:38,306 --> 00:33:40,558
We stay.  Now you got
any helpful suggestions?

313
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:44,153
<i><b>Dog:  Yeah, pull up your pants, Romeo.</b></i>

314
00:33:47,497 --> 00:33:48,828
<i><b>Dog:  Now will you listen to reason?</b></i>

315
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:52,253
<i><b>Dog:  There's too many of them.
You're going to get us shot up.</b></i>

316
00:33:54,266 --> 00:33:56,850
<i><b>Dog:  Damn fool.</b></i>

317
00:33:58,362 --> 00:34:01,285
<i><b>Dog:  There's only one way out of
here.  Boxed in, that's no good.</b></i>

318
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:07,384
<i><b>Dog:  out there in the big
room...what...Quilla: Hello dog, hello...</b></i>

319
00:34:08,466 --> 00:34:11,158
<i><b>Dog:  Oh Jesus, they'll probably
come down the ladder...Quilla:</b></i>

320
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:14,062
<i><b>What's a matter, don't you talk to
strangers?  Dog:  Shut up will you!</b></i>

321
00:34:14,984 --> 00:34:15,825
<i><b>Dog:  I can see it.</b></i>

322
00:34:15,825 --> 00:34:16,806
<i><b>Dog:  It's going to be a great help,</b></i>

323

<i><b>now if we..Quilla:

324

<i><b>Dog:  One down, take his heat that
will get him...Quilla: What's the...</b></i>

325
00:34:21,002 --> 00:34:22,333
<i>Shut up!</i>

326
00:34:51,833 --> 00:34:53,505
<i><b>Dog:  Lovely odds we're
up against, aren't they?</b></i>

327
00:34:53,505 --> 00:34:54,926
Right.  Let's set up for them.

328
00:34:55,178 --> 00:34:57,179
<i><b>Dog:  And I'm right about
the simpering female.</b></i>

329
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:59,604
I get that, now how do
you figure the fight?

330
00:35:41,799 --> 00:35:47,317
<i>[gunshots}</i>

331
00:35:48,569 --> 00:35:51,241

Hey ....

333
00:36:08,626 --> 00:36:10,878
She's moving again.

334
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:21,242
<i>Roar.</i>

335
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,242
Where'd she go?

336
00:36:58,091 --> 00:36:59,422
<i><b>Dog:  Good or bad first.</b></i>

337
00:37:00,344 --> 00:37:01,015
Bad.

338
00:37:01,516 --> 00:37:04,349
<i><b>Dog:  All right, they didn't come
down the ladder like I anticipated</b></i>

339
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:07,363
and since they found other ways in,
we've lost the element of surprise.

340
00:37:07,615 --> 00:37:09,286
<i><b>Dog:  There's no way
we can handle them.</b></i>

341
00:37:10,458 --> 00:37:11,289
And the good?

342
00:37:11,459 --> 00:37:13,101
Let the 7 dwarfs have Snow White and

343
00:37:13,102 --> 00:37:14,974
we can get out of here
with all our parts.

344
00:37:15,555 --> 00:37:16,976
Over my dead body.

345
00:37:18,059 --> 00:37:22,745
<i><b>Dog:  They're working on
that right now. Grrrrr...</b></i>

346
00:37:33,769 --> 00:37:34,359
<i><b>Dog:  Screamers.</b></i>

347
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:35,861
Where?  I don't hear them.

348
00:37:36,944 --> 00:37:39,286
<i><b>Dog:  Now what would everyone
do if they heard one right now.</b></i>

349
00:37:39,787 --> 00:37:41,538
Run like a sonofabitch.

350
00:37:43,131 --> 00:37:44,132
<i><b>Dog:  Ah ha.</b></i>

351
00:37:45,635 --> 00:37:47,056
It's worth a try.

352
00:37:59,092 --> 00:38:00,173
Screamers.

353
00:38:06,693 --> 00:38:07,944
<i>You hear that?</i>

354
00:38:10,618 --> 00:38:11,619
Screamers!

355
00:39:24,947 --> 00:39:26,569
Goddamn it, get out of the way!

356
00:39:35,602 --> 00:39:37,104
<i><b>Dog:  Make certain they've gone, Vic.</b></i>

357
00:39:37,104 --> 00:39:39,606
<i><b>Dog:  Don't stick your
empty head out, Vic.</b></i>

358

Hey,easy...

359
00:39:40,699 --> 00:39:42,871
<i><b>Dog:  Will you shut her up?
I can't hear myself think.</b></i>

360
00:39:45,495 --> 00:39:47,467
<i><b>Dog: Get something green.
Wrap it around a stick.</b></i>

361
00:39:47,467 --> 00:39:50,390
<i><b>Dog:  Wave it up there.  Shine
a flashlight up through it.</b></i>

362
00:39:57,411 --> 00:39:58,322
Have they gone?

363
00:40:00,494 --> 00:40:01,495
What do you see?

364
00:40:02,257 --> 00:40:04,179
Ha, ha, ha, ha...

365
00:40:04,179 --> 00:40:07,434
They are wimps...woohoohoo!

366
00:40:08,104 --> 00:40:09,435
We did it!

367
00:40:09,777 --> 00:40:11,779
I would have given a whole sack of

368
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:14,203
potatoes to see their
faces when they ran!

369
00:40:15,285 --> 00:40:21,392
Hehehe, Hey Blood we did
it, we did it! Woohoohoo.

370
00:40:21,803 --> 00:40:23,816
Come on.  Let's get
the hell out of here.

371
00:40:23,816 --> 00:40:26,399
<i><b>Dog:  They might still be out
there.  Just pull back a little.</b></i>

<i><b>Dog:  Wait until
daylight, then we'll see.</b></i>

373
00:40:28,743 --> 00:40:29,493
Okay.

374
00:40:29,744 --> 00:40:31,415
Well, I'll take the chick in.

375
00:40:33,669 --> 00:40:35,090
<i><b>Dog:  She's right below us.</b></i>

376
00:40:41,529 --> 00:40:44,362
Stupid hick, you wanna
run into one of them?

377
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:53,475
You think I'm bad?  Well you just
wait until you see one of them.

378
00:40:53,555 --> 00:40:55,818
What are they?

379
00:40:55,979 --> 00:40:57,980
I don't know.

380
00:40:57,981 --> 00:40:59,743
I just know you stay away from them.

381
00:40:59,743 --> 00:41:01,745
What?

382
00:41:09,266 --> 00:41:14,863
'Cuz if one of them touches
you you're dead, green dead.

383
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:22,052
<i><b>Dog:  3 of them, move.</b></i>

384

<i><b>Dog:  Come one.</b></i>

385
00:41:47,367 --> 00:41:48,458

386
00:41:48,458 --> 00:41:50,460
<i><b>Do:  By the boiler.  The
insulation might help.</b></i>

387
00:41:50,461 --> 00:41:52,383
Where are we going,
Vic. Why is it? Why....

388
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:54,386
Shut up, and hang on to me.

389
00:41:54,727 --> 00:41:55,387
<i><b>Dog:  Hurry it up.</b></i>

390
00:42:02,657 --> 00:42:05,171
<i><b>Dog:  Help me up there.</b></i>

391
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:13,351
<i><b>Dog:  Yes, this will do.</b></i>

392
00:42:23,045 --> 00:42:25,218
<i><b>Dog:  Clumsy.</b></i>

393
00:42:29,563 --> 00:42:32,326
<i><b>Dog:  I wonder how many
mattresses are in here.</b></i>

394
00:42:32,327 --> 00:42:34,910
<i><b>Dog: Screamers certainly
wouldn't want to be confined.</b></i>

395

<i><b>Dog:  Albert!  Tell this to
keep it's hands to itself!</b></i>

396
00:42:38,335 --> 00:42:39,847
<i><b>Dog:  Maybe somebody else hid in here.</b></i>

397
00:42:40,758 --> 00:42:41,850
<i><b>Dog:  Get yer...</b></i>

398
00:42:42,771 --> 00:42:46,696
<i><b>Dog:  Oh well, somewhat
of a weak call I bet.</b></i>

399
00:42:48,028 --> 00:42:49,289
Catch anything yet?

400
00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:51,292
<i><b>Dog:  Oh well, we're all right so far.</b></i>

401
00:42:51,543 --> 00:42:53,294
You be able to tell when they leave?

402
00:42:53,295 --> 00:42:55,297
<i><b>Dog:  Yes, I'll be able to tell.</b></i>

403
00:42:55,298 --> 00:42:57,300
<i><b>Dog:  If they leave.</b></i>

404
00:43:00,644 --> 00:43:02,907
Just take it easy.  Everything's
going to be all right.

405
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:10,177
That is, if we don't
get choked off in here.

406
00:43:15,024 --> 00:43:16,104
Can you handle it?

407
00:43:16,105 --> 00:43:19,028
<i><b>Dog:  Oh yes, Massah
Vic, I can handle it.</b></i>

408
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,423
<i><b>Dog:  Ugh, breeding is an ugly thing.</b></i>

409
00:45:17,017 --> 00:45:21,112
..long enough for the final misses
to leave their silos on both sides

410
00:45:21,533 --> 00:45:24,456
Let's see that was in 2006

411
00:45:24,456 --> 00:45:25,787
<i><b>Dog:  2007</b></i>

412

Uhh...2007.  It only lasted 5 days.

413
00:45:29,803 --> 00:45:31,635
You're awfully smart to
know all that history..

414
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:37,152
Well Blood helps...a little.

415
00:45:37,153 --> 00:45:38,405
<i><b>Dog:  Humph.</b></i>

416
00:45:38,405 --> 00:45:40,406
Haven't you ever been down under?

417
00:45:40,407 --> 00:45:40,918
Nope.

418
00:45:41,579 --> 00:45:42,750
Why?

419
00:45:42,921 --> 00:45:44,092
It's very nice.

420
00:45:44,093 --> 00:45:46,094
I heard how nice.

421
00:45:46,176 --> 00:45:48,268
From a solo who raided one.

422
00:45:48,268 --> 00:45:51,442
<i>Well it's very nice, and you'd like it.</i>

423
00:45:51,443 --> 00:45:52,613
Bullshit!

424
00:45:52,614 --> 00:45:53,695
That's very crude.

425
00:45:54,116 --> 00:45:55,688
I'm very crude.

426
00:45:57,962 --> 00:45:59,293
Not all the time.

427
00:45:59,383 --> 00:46:02,886
Listen, ass, I grabbed you
and brung you down here.

428
00:46:03,309 --> 00:46:04,890
So what's so good about me?

429
00:46:07,404 --> 00:46:10,407
I didn't mind.  I liked it.

430
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,672
You want to do it again?

431
00:46:16,847 --> 00:46:20,191
Well I've never seen no
chick like you before.

432
00:46:21,022 --> 00:46:25,788
Hey, I'm the one who's
supposed to wanna....do it.

<i><b>Dog:  Once more into

<i>Honey, it's good to just watch you.</i>

437
00:46:51,432 --> 00:46:53,104
Your waist falls in.

438
00:46:54,026 --> 00:46:57,450
your hips out, they
fit right in my hands.

439
00:46:59,543 --> 00:47:00,214
Just want to talk.

440
00:47:00,214 --> 00:47:03,889
<i><b>Dog:  I'm not just going to keep

Oh, boy, you're a bloody mess.

<i><b>Dog:  Seems clear.  I

<i><b>Dog:  Can I handle in my condition,

hours on the rack to extricate
myself from this disgusting display.

448
00:47:44,744 --> 00:47:45,495

throw myself gladly into
the very jaws of death.

451
00:48:06,473 --> 00:48:08,896
I don't think he likes me very much.

452
00:48:10,398 --> 00:48:10,988
Blood?

453
00:48:11,319 --> 00:48:11,990
Yeah.

454
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:15,745
Oh, he just feels bad.
He likes you a lot.

455
00:48:16,666 --> 00:48:17,667
He told me so.

456
00:48:18,509 --> 00:48:19,509
He did really?

457
00:48:19,510 --> 00:48:20,591
Uh, huh.

458
00:48:20,591 --> 00:48:23,685
That's nice, because I think he's cute.

459
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:28,783
How do you do it?

460
00:48:29,113 --> 00:48:29,784
What?

461
00:48:29,784 --> 00:48:30,875
Talk to him.

462
00:48:31,877 --> 00:48:33,708
I don't know, I never thought about it.

463
00:48:34,550 --> 00:48:35,711
Just talk.

464
00:48:37,303 --> 00:48:39,145
Well, how come I can't hear him?

465
00:48:41,479 --> 00:48:43,320
Uh, he said something one time.

466
00:48:45,495 --> 00:48:47,668
He thought we had a feeling
for each other or something.

467
00:48:50,671 --> 00:48:52,844
What do you mean, like love?

468
00:48:52,844 --> 00:48:54,015
I guess.

469
00:48:54,937 --> 00:48:57,279
I don't know.

470
00:48:57,441 --> 00:48:58,442
He said we though alike.

471
00:48:59,864 --> 00:49:01,705
Ha ha, I don't know.

472
00:49:04,290 --> 00:49:07,133
Well, anyway...

473
00:49:11,979 --> 00:49:14,493
We'll get a nice little place...

474
00:49:14,994 --> 00:49:18,578
and, we'll spend a lot
of time together alone...

475
00:49:18,579 --> 00:49:21,342
and do whatever we feel like doing.

476
00:49:21,343 --> 00:49:25,438
and when Blood comes to visit
he can have his own room.

477
00:49:28,441 --> 00:49:29,693
What are you talking about?

478
00:49:29,694 --> 00:49:32,036
Well, I don't exactly think
he's going to fit in Down Under.

479
00:49:32,958 --> 00:49:35,040
No way!

480
00:49:35,041 --> 00:49:36,132
No, that's what I said.

481
00:49:36,132 --> 00:49:38,134
No, I mean, no way
I'm going down there.

482
00:49:41,730 --> 00:49:42,810
I'm going to be there.

483
00:49:42,811 --> 00:49:44,813
No, you're not.

484
00:49:45,074 --> 00:49:46,816
We'll make it up here, the 3 of us.

485
00:49:47,407 --> 00:49:48,819
Vic, now I live there.

486
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:50,000
If you love me...

487
00:49:50,001 --> 00:49:51,503
I don't care.

488
00:49:55,098 --> 00:49:56,600
<i><b>Dog:  Come out here right now.</b></i>

489
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:59,613
<i><b>Dog:  Vic, we need to talk.</b></i>

490
00:50:08,715 --> 00:50:10,557
What the hell's lumbering you.

491
00:50:10,558 --> 00:50:13,401
<i><b>Dog:  Your headlong
plunge into stupidity.</b></i>

492
00:50:13,402 --> 00:50:15,404
<i><b>Dog:  Last night was inexcusable.</b></i>

493
00:50:15,654 --> 00:50:17,176
<i><b>Dog:  Leaving her for the pack would</b></i>

494
00:50:17,176 --> 00:50:18,748
have been the intelligent thing to do.

495
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:19,750
I wanted her.

496
00:50:20,331 --> 00:50:22,223
<i><b>Dog:  I know you
wanted her about half a</b></i>

497
00:50:22,223 --> 00:50:24,256
hundred times.  Why we
still hanging around?

498
00:50:24,257 --> 00:50:25,678
I want her some more.

499
00:50:25,768 --> 00:50:28,682
Well listen my friend I want to
get rid of this pain in my side

500
00:50:28,682 --> 00:50:30,063
and I want to get away from here.

501
00:50:30,064 --> 00:50:31,866
The screamers can come
back any time, you know.

502
00:50:32,277 --> 00:50:33,989
Oh, what the hell you worrying

503
00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:36,212
about that for.  We
can handle all that.

504
00:50:36,623 --> 00:50:37,964
That don't mean she can't go with us.

505
00:50:37,964 --> 00:50:41,809
<i><b>Dog:  Go with us?  Are
you out of your small mind?</b></i>

506
00:50:41,810 --> 00:50:45,144
<i><b>Dog:  What good is she?  It's all
we can do to feed our own selves.</b></i>

507
00:50:45,145 --> 00:50:47,658
You know you're starting
to sound like a poodle.

508
00:50:47,658 --> 00:50:49,740
<i><b>Dog:  You're starting
to sound like a jackass.</b></i>

509
00:50:54,756 --> 00:50:55,677
Sorry.

510
00:50:58,351 --> 00:51:02,617
Blood, come on.  Hey!

511
00:51:03,869 --> 00:51:06,372
It will still be 50 50 with you and me.

512
00:51:06,703 --> 00:51:07,874
Hell, I owe you.

513
00:51:07,964 --> 00:51:10,548
<i><b>Dog:  Don't try that
hackney ruse on me.</b></i>

514
00:51:10,548 --> 00:51:13,481
Oh come on, I just meant like that time

515
00:51:13,482 --> 00:51:16,646
that, that old screamer
made a grab for me.

516
00:51:17,147 --> 00:51:20,261
You know that righteous
tone green he was too,

517
00:51:20,261 --> 00:51:23,585
all glowing like a fungus,
oozing and eyelashes...

518
00:51:25,588 --> 00:51:30,024
Boy, made a grab for
me, and you went for him.

519
00:51:31,356 --> 00:51:36,372
You'd been burned bad, too, and died.

520
00:51:37,374 --> 00:51:41,128
That would have been
all of it for you, right?

521
00:51:41,129 --> 00:51:43,762
<i><b>Dog:  Now get that dramatic catch
out of your voice and tell me</b></i>

522
00:51:43,762 --> 00:51:46,565
how she's going to carry her share
of the load up here.  Tell me....

523
00:51:46,566 --> 00:51:48,819
All right, okay, just don't hang her

524
00:51:48,819 --> 00:51:49,659
<i><b>Dog:  Harangue, not hang her..</b></i>

525
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:51,312
I don't care whatever the
hell, you just knock of

526
00:51:51,313 --> 00:51:53,165
the crap or we can forget
the whole stinking arrangement

527
00:51:54,086 --> 00:51:56,259
<i><b>Dog:  Well, maybe we
should, you simple dumb putz.</b></i>

528
00:51:56,839 --> 00:52:00,184
Putz.  What's a putz.
Is that something bad?

529
00:52:00,434 --> 00:52:02,948
I'll bet it is.  It's
something bad. You better watch

530
00:52:02,948 --> 00:52:05,611
your stinking mouth or I'm
going to kick you in the butt.

531
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,412
<i><b>Dog:  Definitely a putz.</b></i>

532
00:52:27,841 --> 00:52:29,843
<i>Oomph!</i>

533
00:52:30,094 --> 00:52:32,847
<i><b>Dog:  Hahaha, That means she can't</b></i>

534
00:52:32,847 --> 00:52:35,691
go with us.  I told she was no good.

535
00:52:36,202 --> 00:52:37,694
Okay, okay.

536
00:52:38,786 --> 00:52:40,958
I just don't like being
made to feel guilty.

537
00:52:41,550 --> 00:52:42,961
I'm going to do right by you.

538
00:52:42,961 --> 00:52:44,412
<i><b>Dog:  I would highly recommend that</b></i>

539
00:52:44,413 --> 00:52:46,405
considering there are
several knowledgeable solos

540
00:52:46,405 --> 00:52:48,147
around town who would
be delighted to work

541
00:52:48,148 --> 00:52:50,150
with an accomplished
female provider like myself.

542
00:52:50,401 --> 00:52:52,154
I also don't like being threatened.

543
00:52:52,154 --> 00:52:53,665
<i><b>Dog:  It's not a threat, that's a fact.</b></i>

544
00:52:53,746 --> 00:52:55,919
No, that's a good way to
get that other leg broke.

545
00:52:55,919 --> 00:52:58,121
<i><b>Dog:  Don't take your
petty frustrations out on me</b></i>

546
00:52:58,122 --> 00:53:00,595
Albert, I locate females I
don't guarantee their behavior.

547
00:53:00,685 --> 00:53:01,266
What the hell's that?

548
00:53:01,266 --> 00:53:02,436
<i><b>Dog:  Well how should I know?</b></i>

549
00:53:02,437 --> 00:53:03,518
Well smell it.

550
00:53:04,019 --> 00:53:07,283
<i><b>Dog:  It's probably some ID she
used to get out of the Down Under.</b></i>

551
00:53:08,115 --> 00:53:10,878
<i><b>Dog:  Oh, now we're in a big hurry.</b></i>

552
00:53:11,879 --> 00:53:14,132
<i><b>Dog:  Now if you'd listened
to me last night instead of...</b></i>

<i><b>Dog:  Wait a minute...you're not

554
00:53:18,599 --> 00:53:20,061
<i><b>Dog:  You, you listen to me Albert.</b></i>

555
00:53:23,245 --> 00:53:24,826
<i><b>Dog:  You, you'll get killed out there.</b></i>

556
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,542
<i><b>Dog:  Albert.  Albert.

<i><b>Dog: You idiot, you can't go
down there.  You listen to me.</b></i>

558
00:53:32,517 --> 00:53:33,667
<i><b>Dog:  Because some stinking female</b></i>

559
00:53:33,668 --> 00:53:35,150
knocked you on the head
and bruised your ego,

00:53:35,522 --> 00:53:36,983
<i><b>Dog:  there's no reason to
become a callous juvenile.</b></i>

<i><b>Dog:  You stop this
instant Albert!.. Vic</b></i>

562
00:53:40,117 --> 00:53:40,998
Egg sucker.

00:53:41,169 --> 00:53:41,870
All right.

564
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,131
<i><b>Dog:  Vic, please don't.</b></i>

565

<i><b>Dog:  Your not thinking clearly.

<i><b>Dog:  Down Unders hate solos. Enough</b></i>

570
00:54:06,072 --> 00:54:07,944
rover packs have
raided down there and...

<i><b>Dog:  and raped their woman

What the hell do you care?

Lack of respect.  Wrong attitude.

That's that.

Then I'll be put on the committee
right away, like we talked about.

Hmm, don't you worry about it, little

Mr. Craddock, I would
prefer not to wait.

here exactly like  you told me to.

Have fun with the young
folks your own age.

married making a home.

686

Your time will come.

687
01:05:46,156 --> 01:05:48,368
I'd rather be just like you, Miss Mez

688
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:50,371
And not wait.

689
01:05:50,711 --> 01:05:52,373
Well, don't you worry, little girl.

690

That will be all, that will be all.

That young lady's going to be trouble.

693

Always has been.  Any
reason for her to change?

694
01:06:10,138 --> 01:06:11,349
Maybe you should have gone to three.

See that she's one of the recipients.

700
01:06:25,007 --> 01:06:27,811
Then marry her off to Harriman
and his boy, what's his name.

Charlie, yeah.

703

If that don't cool her
ambitions, farm her out.

01:28:02,297 --> 01:28:04,299
<i><b>Dog:  Instead of hooking
you up to the machine</b></i>

1075
01:28:04,300 --> 01:28:06,843
<i><b>Dog:  You'd probably
never come back up.</b></i>

1076
01:28:06,843 --> 01:28:08,845
<i>[Blood laughs}</i>

1077
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:13,702
You sure you had enough to eat?

1078
01:28:14,112 --> 01:28:16,125
<i><b>Dog: Oh yes</b></i>

1079
01:28:17,457 --> 01:28:18,498
<i><b>Dog:  I'm satiated.</b></i>

1080
01:28:18,498 --> 01:28:18,918
What?

1081
01:28:19,419 --> 01:28:20,630
<i><b>Dog:  Nothing, I said I'm full</b></i>

1082
01:28:20,631 --> 01:28:24,396
<i><b>Dog:  But after we walk all day, you'll
probably have to cook up what's left.</b></i>

1083
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:28,531
She said she loved me.

1084
01:28:30,454 --> 01:28:34,339
Oh hell, it wasn't my fault she
picked me to get all wet-brained over.

1085
01:28:36,673 --> 01:28:39,937
<i><b>Dog:  Well I'd say she had
marvelous judgment, Albert</b></i>

1086
01:28:39,937 --> 01:28:42,900
<i><b>Dog:  If not particularly good taste</b></i>

01:28:45,615 --> 01:28:48,378
<i><b>Dog: particularly good....</b></i>

<i>A boy and his dog</i>

go walking

1090
01:29:04,259 --> 01:29:07,653
A boy and his dog sometimes

1091
01:29:07,654 --> 01:29:10,308
talk to each other.

1092
01:29:11,429 --> 01:29:13,521
A boy and a dog

1093
01:29:14,172 --> 01:29:17,426
can be happy sitting
down in the woods on a log

1094
01:29:17,687 --> 01:29:22,083
but a dog knows his boy can go wrong.

1095
01:29:25,758 --> 01:29:27,610
A boy and his dog

1096

can go fishing

1097
01:29:32,738 --> 01:29:36,473
A boy can teach a
dog to bring a dish in

1098
01:29:36,913 --> 01:29:38,474
when he's hungry.

1099
01:29:39,687 --> 01:29:41,739
A boy and his dog

1100
01:29:42,281 --> 01:29:45,815
can be happy sitting
out in the woods on a log

1101
01:29:45,815 --> 01:29:50,391
but a dog knows his boy can go wrong.

1102
01:30:04,870 --> 01:30:16,364
"Do you know what love is?"

1103
01:30:17,447 --> 01:30:25,807
"A boy loves his dog"
