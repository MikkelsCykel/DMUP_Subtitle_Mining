1
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:09,413
How should we remember
Darren Mullet?

2
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:13,698
To his parents he was a beloved son.

3
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,012
To his teachers he was a fine student,
bright and eager to learn.

4
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,809
But to the majority of us he was a friend.

5
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:25,575
- Bullshit! You fucking hypocrite!
- How dare you? Get him out of here!

6
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:29,255
You weren't Darren's friends! He didn't
have any! That's why he killed himself!

7
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:33,538
You killed him!
All of you, you murdered him!

8
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,419
- Agh!
- You're not all the bloody ticket, you.

9
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,652
There's people in there crying. Upset.

10
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,970
Show some respect!

11
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,494
I hope you all rot in hell!

12
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:34,216
# I'm not afraid to let you kill me

13
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:44,858
# I know no other way
to fill your hollow bones

14
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:49,730
# I fade into the shadow with you

15
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,209
# I know

16
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,895
# So dead in love, so dead in love

17
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:59,848
# Did you hear my heart stop beating?

18
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:03,490
# Guess it's never enough
No, it's never enough

19
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,413
# Until my heart stops beating

20
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:09,014
# So dead in love

21
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:18,339
# So dead in love, so dead in love

22
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,094
# Did you hear my heart stop beating? #

23
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,059
Get in.
The Dick's giving us the afternoon off.

24
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,973
- Gotta love the Dick.
- Oh, yes.

25
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:37,290
Woo-oo. Woo-oo.

26
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:41,055
Death is so erogenous.

27
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,256
I wish I was dead.

28
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,935
- Party at Bradley's tonight.
- Hmm.

29
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,456
- You got a problem?
- I think suicide is so beautiful.

30
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,293
Not the way Mullet did it.
You got to slash your wrists.

31
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:58,135
That boy hanged himself.
How can that be an excuse for a party?

32
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,291
Oh, don't worry, sweetie.

33
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:04,135
No one was going to invite you.

34
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,256
OK, guys.

35
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:09,253
I'm going to ask Justine to the party.

36
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:12,969
Lexy, just 'cause she's Head Girl,
it doesn't mean she gives the best head.

37
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,495
- Oh.
- Yeah?

38
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,493
- Well, I think she's interesting, so...
- Interesting?

39
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,015
- What, you want to give me a kiss?
- No.

40
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,057
No?

41
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,212
- Didn't you used to be friends with him?
- My mother knew his mother.

42
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,098
It was embarrassing.

43
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:31,172
Your parents think because they have
something in common with someone,

44
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,695
you have to have something
in common with their brats.

45
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:36,135
I fucking hate that. Fucking hate it.

46
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,656
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, who is that?

47
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:43,415
That's Jason Banks.
He was a friend of Darren Mullet.

48
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,652
- Hey, Justine. Great speech.
- Oh, I didn't think I did him justice.

49
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,731
I haven't got anything
in common with anyone.

50
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,095
- Nor do I.
- I don't either.

51
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,649
- Nor do I.
- Nothing.

52
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,493
- Not a thing in common with anyone.
- Yeah, I said it first.

53
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,537
I think she's quite nice.

54
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:03,535
Sophie, you think everyone's nice.
The girl's a frigid, kiss-arse bitch.

55
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,260
So a few of us are going
to Bradley's later for a party.

56
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,819
Inappropriate.

57
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,891
She smells really nice.

58
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,210
Why have you started smelling
Justine Fielding?

59
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,938
Why have you started smelling her?

60
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,012
- What? You smell nice.
- Oh, thank you.

61
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,216
- You smell like cabbage.
- What?

62
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,699
- Fucking cabbage?
- Yeah.

63
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,259
Come on, fun will be had.

64
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,058
She's coming to my house
to watch 'Atonement'.

65
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,051
You could do that tomorrow night.

66
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:29,018
Or next week. Or never.

67
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:32,536
- Rah!
- I didn't use lube!

68
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,691
And you won't really know anyone.

69
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,771
Bradley, Bradley, Bradley.

70
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,578
Bradley, Bradley.

71
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,651
I think I can hear a whining noise.

72
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:44,335
No whining noise. Word is there's going
to be a bit of a party at yours later.

73
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,334
Dude, we're at a funeral.
Show some fucking respect.

74
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,219
What the fuck?

75
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,018
The digits.

76
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,774
If anything goes wrong,
I'm on speed dial.

77
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:03,899
Helena, I wouldn't mind
having some fun for once in my life.

78
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,851
Well.

79
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,931
We have fun.

80
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,931
# If you don't wanna be my best friend
then why am I still in your bed?

81
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,490
# If you can't stand the way I talk
then why am I still here?

82
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:22,652
# If we can't work it out then how about
getting your stuff and movin' out?

83
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:26,813
# If we can't be lovers again

84
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:30,416
# If I don't give you anything
then why are you still hanging on?

85
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:33,936
# Why are you still hanging on?
Why are you still hanging on?

86
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:37,649
# If you can't see I'm everything
I'm everything you'll ever need

87
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:41,369
# You must be out of your head

88
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:45,533
# I don't know what planet you're on
but I wanna be on it with you

89
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,339
# I don't know where you get off

90
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:53,130
# I don't know what planet you're on
but I wanna be on it with you

91
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,656
# I wanna be on it with you...

92
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,653
Look like someone
discovered Primark, then?

93
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:07,294
# If you don't wanna be my best friend
then why am I still in your bed?

94
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,893
# If you can't stand the way I...

95
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,972
Oi, oi, oi, oi. Check this, check this!

96
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:16,656
<u>We got the motherfucking
5- 0 in the crib!</u>

97
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:21,371
Oh! Listen, listen, I'm going to get
old school here for a minute.

98
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,929
# H to the E to the A to the D

99
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,978
# I look with my eyes
Can't believe what I see

100
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,256
# I'm a lyrical gangster
I rap till I choke

101
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:32,173
# Head Girl here
Can't you see that's a joke? #

102
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:35,571
- What you saying, blud?
- I invited her, yeah?

103
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:38,652
Chill out, blud.
What's your problem, bro?

104
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,732
- Have we got a problem, huh?
- No, listen, it's all good.

105
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:45,779
- Hey, where are you going?
- I knew I shouldn't have come.

106
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,373
Yeah, screw the party.

107
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:50,850
If we hurry round to Helena's,
we can still catch the movie.

108
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:55,377
- Have you been upsetting my guests?
- Nah, bro, I was joking. You get me?

109
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:58,100
- Don't play with the boobs.
- I ain't your fucking bro.

110
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,649
Listen, you lot need to chill out.

111
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:04,256
It's Darren Mullet's leaving do.
The fat twat is dead.

112
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:07,492
You gotta drink to that.
You get me? Give me some.

113
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:10,015
Why the fuck
would you even say that shit to me?

114
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:12,899
- Bradley, mate, it's me.
- Sort him out.

115
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,528
Mate, come on.
Bradley, it's me, it's Jeremy.

116
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:19,295
- Come on. Come on, man.
- Shh. Suck my titties!

117
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,537
- Alex, nobody wants me here.
- I do.

118
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,458
Fuck you.

119
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,891
And fuck Darren Mullet as well!

120
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:53,896
Come on.

121
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:59,896
# I wanna be on it with you
I wanna be on it with you

122
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,413
# Oh, yeah #

123
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:05,129
So beautiful.

124
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,370
Keira's going to win the Oscar this year.

125
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:11,533
Let's watch it again,
with the commentary off this time.

126
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,652
Is there somewhere quiet we can go?

127
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,970
I can't hear you.

128
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,938
Is there somewhere quieter we can go?

129
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,694
- Yeah, yeah, we can go upstairs.
- OK.

130
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,055
OK, good.

131
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,890
Um... this...

132
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:56,531
...this is Bradley's room. Obviously.

133
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,736
I'm sorry about the artwork.

134
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,093
This probably isn't
how you imagined our first date, but...

135
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:12,172
Oh, this is a date now?

136
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:15,537
Yeah, that was the basis
I was working on.

137
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:20,211
It's a pretty cheap date, Alex.

138
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:24,419
Yeah, but technically it still qualifies.

139
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,935
We're OK?

140
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:34,092
- We're not OK.
- We're OK.

141
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,931
Well, if this is a date,

142
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:45,653
then it does mean at some point
we're going to have to do some kissing.

143
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:49,130
You know, they're the rules,
I'm as annoyed about it as you are.

144
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,939
- Really?
- Yeah.

145
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:55,456
And will that be happening
any time soon?

146
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,658
Die, you fucker!

147
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:03,334
Fucking change weapon.

148
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,536
- Hang on.
- What is it, babes?

149
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,089
Oh, it'll only be Alexis
asking for more muscle

150
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:10,569
to prise the princess's knees apart.

151
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,095
It's from Mullet.

152
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:16,172
- Shut up. It's not funny.
- I'm not joking. It's his number.

153
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:21,289
Well, it'll only be his little friend.
You know, Jizzum Wanks.

154
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,655
You mean Jason Banks?

155
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,493
Oh, isn't... isn't that what I said?

156
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:30,255
- He says I'm a fucking bitch.
- Obviously knows you, then.

157
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,773
Piss off, Bradley.

158
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,295
Oh, my God.

159
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,020
He says I'm a filthy slag.

160
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,818
'You're a batty boy. '

161
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,699
' You're a batty boy. '

162
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:45,250
- OK, joke's over.
- 'You're... '

163
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:49,136
All right, Jizzum Wanks,
you creepy little twat,

164
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:53,054
tomorrow at school I'm going to
make kebabs out of your nads.

165
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,529
Sweet dreams.

166
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,168
- What did he say?
- Nothing, but I could hear him breathing.

167
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,569
Sorry.

168
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:21,091
' I'm going to kill you.

169
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:24,172
' I'm going to kill you.

170
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:28,015
' I'm going to kill you. '

171
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,368
Someone could walk in on us.

172
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,416
It's just me and you.

173
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,252
Punked, you fuckers.

174
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,569
Hug your pillow. Hug your pillow.

175
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,571
Fuck you, all right? Fuck off.

176
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,651
Mullet?

177
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:21,698
Mullet? Where you at?

178
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:26,216
Where you hiding, fool? Sick.

179
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:29,019
I think we should have a toast to Shrek.

180
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,772
To who?

181
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,931
Darren Mullet, the guy we planted today.

182
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,852
Oh, I can't drink to that.

183
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:39,650
They didn't mean we're celebrating.
They just... You know, to say goodbye.

184
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:42,539
- Hmm.
- That's all she meant, Justine.

185
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,772
- Why do you call him Shrek?
- Why do you think?

186
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:48,056
Because he was big...

187
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,733
and green

188
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,652
and ugly.

189
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:54,414
Except he wasn't actually
that green, though, was he?

190
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:58,539
But, fuck me, was he ugly!

191
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,453
Wasn't that the skinny kid
who threw up in assembly?

192
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:05,818
That's priceless. You spoke at his
funeral and you didn't know who he was.

193
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:09,177
Well, in that case we should definitely
give him a proper sendoff, right?

194
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:12,059
Justine, why don't you do the toast?

195
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:17,049
Er... rest in peace, Darren Mullet.

196
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,575
Lardy Boy.

197
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,651
To Lardy Boy.

198
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,412
Mm.

199
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,778
Mm, rest in piss, bro.

200
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:30,454
Ah.

201
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,531
Ha-ha-ha.

202
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:40,694
# One for my homies, one for my blud
One for my jeans...

203
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:47,733
Paying my respect
the only way I know how.

204
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:53,289
To Mullet. I bet the only reason
you hung yourself...

205
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:57,214
...was 'cause
you were trying to get a hard-on.

206
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,819
You were just trying to get wood, boy.

207
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:36,969
# That's the start,
the middle and the end

208
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:40,530
# Aren't you glad the universe pretends?

209
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:47,970
# If I don't get this message honed
once again I'm gonna hate alone

210
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,971
# Ride with me

211
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:54,053
# Ride with me, ride with me

212
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,939
# Oh, ride with me

213
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,649
# Ride with me, ride with me...

214
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:27,219
Justine, Jason and I were discussing
his little outburst yesterday.

215
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:31,976
And while I accept that he was upset
about the loss of his friend...

216
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:34,256
I didn't lose him. He killed himself.

217
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:42,612
Unless I hear an apology, I will have
no choice but to contact your parents.

218
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:48,777
- I'm sorry I called you a hypocrite.
- There, that wasn't so hard, was it?

219
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,132
Thank you, Justine.

220
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,416
'Richard,
Jeremy Prendergast's mother called.

221
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:58,538
'He went to a party last night
and he hasn't come home. '

222
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,339
If I know Jeremy, he's probably
lying drunk in a gutter somewhere.

223
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,889
'I dare say he'll turn up. '

224
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:12,656
Hey, Daddy. Hey.

225
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,688
Wait, Jason.

226
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:20,011
Look, I'm really sorry
about what happened to your friend.

227
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:23,616
- What was I supposed to say?
- You could have told the truth.

228
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,418
What, with his parents sitting there?

229
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:28,458
I could hardly say, "I'm sorry,
but I didn't know who he was. "

230
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:32,408
- You don't even remember him?
- No, I don't.

231
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:36,050
- He was completely in love with you.
- Don't be stupid, he didn't know me.

232
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,653
Everybody knows you.

233
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:40,812
You're like Princess fucking Diana
in this dump.

234
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:44,370
Darren thought the sun
shone out of your arsehole.

235
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,929
If your friend liked me,
why didn't he say anything?

236
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:50,490
- You'd have laughed in his face.
- No, I wouldn't. I'm not like that.

237
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,571
OK, I'm not blaming you.

238
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:56,858
It's just is how it is. You keep
to your kind, and we'll keep to ours.

239
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:00,535
- I don't have a kind.
- Snotty, spoilt bitches. That's your kind.

240
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,292
Yeah, and what's yours?

241
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:06,373
My kind are the people
you can't quite remember.

242
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:11,928
Darren would have
wanted you to have this.

243
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,056
Wait, Jason.

244
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:21,412
'I'm sorry, I can't go on
any more. They won't leave me alone.

245
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:24,299
'And now Justine has joined in.

246
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:28,014
'I don't know what I did
to make her hate me.

247
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:31,650
'She was my angel
and I will watch over her for all eternity.

248
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,816
'Goodbye. Darren. '

249
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,569
Oh, Miss. I'm so sorry.

250
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:41,698
What had you so enraptured?

251
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:44,658
Is it a note from your boyfriend?

252
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:47,254
No, no, it's... it's nothing.

253
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,854
I understand you've been offered
a place to read Law, at Oxford.

254
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:52,693
- Yeah, I got the letter last week.
- No one deserves it more.

255
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:58,378
Your contribution to my Citizenship
classes has always been exemplary.

256
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:03,534
Guys, you know the funeral march,
yeah? Bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, yeah?

257
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,453
I'm going to mash it up
with 'Lesbian Roadkill' by Tantric Dwarf.

258
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:12,616
You know the one, yeah?
"My mom raped me, and I liked it. "

259
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:15,499
- That is genius.
- You said it, not me.

260
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:21,653
Oi, Dracula, a word, if you don't mind.
I want that website taken down.

261
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,698
OK, yeah. Yeah, no worries, Brad.
I'll do it later.

262
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:27,658
I've got some time booked in the pod.
I'm doing this killer track.

263
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,890
I don't give a shit
about your Emo tit-wank.

264
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:32,858
I want the site down,
and I want it done today.

265
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:37,377
Because if that ain't, well,
you won't need to self-harm,

266
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,417
'cause I'll be doing it for you.

267
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,298
Clear?

268
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:45,738
Yeah, I was planning to do it anyway.
A piece of piss, Brad.

269
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,936
Let's go this way.

270
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,130
You should have come to Film Club.

271
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,575
We ate so much chocolate,
we were nearly sick.

272
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:18,130
Emily was on fire.
We're doing it again tonight.

273
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:21,178
Oh. Er... maybe.

274
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,376
I don't know.

275
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,216
Don't you say a word.

276
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,570
What fucker wrote this?

277
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,651
Did you?

278
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,890
Was it you?

279
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,569
- No?
- No.

280
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,890
Stand up. Look at me.

281
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,016
Clean it off.

282
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,454
Shut up.

283
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,531
'You're a batty boy.

284
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:03,260
' You're... '

285
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,251
Jason Banks is a dead man.

286
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,575
You really know how to enjoy yourself,
don't you?

287
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:18,413
Alex, this is a library.
What are you doing here?

288
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:21,572
What are you saying?
I practically live here.

289
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:24,174
That's my buddy Jeff, the librarian.

290
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,934
You all right, Jeff? How's it going?

291
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:30,172
- His name's Trevor.
- Trevor.

292
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,376
Seriously?

293
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,258
Well, that explains a lot.

294
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,497
Justine, about last night.

295
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:40,538
You're not to blame
for what Bradley dreams up.

296
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:44,454
I wasn't talking about Bradley,
I was talking about you.

297
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:48,613
I think you are moving way too fast.
I felt like I was being pressured.

298
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:55,577
Seriously, Juss.
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

299
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:59,130
I just don't want you to think
that that's what I'm about.

300
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:06,729
Well, I did have my doubts,
but this swung it for me.

301
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:10,179
I didn't have you down
as the sentimental type.

302
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:14,289
What was that?

303
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:18,453
You like her too, now?
Well, it's too bad. I saw her first.

304
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:22,852
Yes, I am gonna ask her out
on another date.

305
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:25,739
OK, but if I made it clear
it wouldn't involve any power tools,

306
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,016
do you think she'd go for it?

307
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:34,293
- He thinks you're going to say yes.
- Well, he's smarter than he looks.

308
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:40,137
OK, well, I will leave the two of you
in peace to sort out the details.

309
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,737
Jeff, we should hook up.

310
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,050
Call me.

311
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:58,049
'Eugh! Your pussy stinks.

312
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:01,257
' Eugh! Your pussy stinks.

313
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,415
OK, settle down. Settle down.

314
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,538
Macbeth, act three, scene four.

315
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:23,170
This is the scene
in which Banquo's ghost appears.

316
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:26,412
- Or does he? Yeah?
- Yes, but only Macbeth can see him.

317
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:31,176
Yeah. Good, Helena.
But why? Why is this?

318
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:34,298
The room is full of people but only
Macbeth can see the ghost. Yeah?

319
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:38,169
Macbeth had Banquo killed
so Banquo's come back to haunt him.

320
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:42,128
- He only wants to scare Macbeth.
- Possibly.

321
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:45,133
- Justine?
- Sorry?

322
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:49,373
Why is it that only Macbeth
can see Banquo's ghost?

323
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:53,169
Um... well, I think that the ghost
is a figment of Macbeth's imagination.

324
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:56,377
Exactly, so Macbeth
has repressed his guilt...

325
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:58,258
- Who's that?
... and the ghost is his conscience

326
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:00,376
that has come back to haunt him.

327
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,893
Now, how does this relate

328
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:05,370
to the representation
of the supernatural in the play?

329
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:09,328
One second, Helena. So, it works
on two levels. So, Heckerty...

330
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:35,010
Huh? Oh, you want me to take
the site down, do you?

331
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:38,729
OK. OK, Bradley, yeah, yeah.
No problems. I'll get right round to it.

332
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,733
Right round to it. After a... That!

333
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,811
Karate chop to your neck, huh?

334
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:47,575
What's that? You can't breathe? How
about a little slap around your cheeks?

335
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:52,131
Huh, fuck you, Bradley White,
you little bitch, with your little willy.

336
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,416
Huh? I fucking hate you.

337
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,411
I'm worth 100 Bradleys! That's right.

338
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:59,140
The Nas isn't scared of you.

339
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:01,939
Ugh!

340
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,933
We're very concerned

341
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:15,218
that bullying may be a contributory factor
in the incident with the Mullet boy.

342
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:18,975
That is why I am personally
overseeing the implementation

343
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,415
of a new anti-bullying initiative.

344
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:26,813
And as the cornerstone
of our new strategy, we are using these.

345
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:29,175
Visualisations of mission statements

346
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:33,015
arising from the ethos strand
of the school development programme.

347
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:38,408
Hey kid, go tell Swanny that
the Head wants to see Jason Banks.

348
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,298
Tell her yourself.

349
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:43,736
Oi, you cheeky little prick,
do as you're told.

350
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,892
- Kids these days! No fucking respect.
- I blame the schools.

351
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:48,334
Hmm.

352
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:54,530
Listen everybody, there is a screw
missing from the guillotine guard,

353
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,736
so it is very, very dangerous.

354
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:00,057
- Miss.
- Yes?

355
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:02,609
- The Head wants to see Jason Banks.
- Right.

356
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:07,618
Well, well, well. If it isn't Jizzum Wanks.

357
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:20,899
Oh, God's fucking bollocks.

358
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,891
Oh.

359
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:25,016
Oh. Huh?

360
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,371
Bradley.

361
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:31,212
Huh!

362
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:34,975
Hey, Bradley?
Hey, Bradley, that's not funny.

363
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:37,017
Bradley!

364
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:41,536
No, no.

365
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,214
Someone, help. Someone, help!

366
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:47,338
Someone help me!
Help me! Help me! Help me!

367
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,331
Someone!

368
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:54,293
No, no.

369
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:56,212
Help me!

370
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,811
We think that it is vital

371
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:14,531
that young people should have
an outlet for their creative energies.

372
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:20,138
Well, he certainly
seems to be enjoying his music.

373
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:23,292
Obviously, it's something
with a good beat.

374
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,697
Where is he?

375
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,014
Must have gone outside.

376
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,891
Tag. You're it.

377
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:21,810
Fuck me, I'm out of breath.

378
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:26,459
Now, what I was trying to say was

379
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:29,259
how sorry I am
that Mullet decided to top himself.

380
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:34,733
Bit selfish of him, really,
leaving Mr Jizzy No-Mates here.

381
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:37,573
Not even one fat spaz to call a friend.

382
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,492
You bastard.

383
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:43,414
Ah, you're a plucky little fucker,
aren't you?

384
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:51,970
Ah! Now.

385
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,653
Mullet is dead.

386
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:56,937
Which means
he can't be sending me texts.

387
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,818
I don't think you get a signal up there.

388
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:01,050
I can't even get a signal in the bogs.

389
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,619
Exactly.

390
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:08,696
Now, pretending to be Shrek
risen from the dead ain't a bad gag.

391
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:11,374
Give me his phone
and, er... we'll call it quits.

392
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:16,534
- I haven't got his phone.
- Jason, Jason, Jason.

393
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:19,691
You're only hurting yourself, mate.

394
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:28,899
It's from Mullet.

395
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:32,848
- It can't be.
- Who's doing this, Brad?

396
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:36,296
"Who's doing this, Brad?"
How the fuck do I know who's doing it?

397
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:39,728
Brad, it wasn't him.

398
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:43,131
I don't give a fuck.
He gets on my tits, anyway.

399
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:48,290
- What's going on in here, lads?
- Nothing, sir.

400
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:59,892
Go on, then.
Get back to class, yeah?

401
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:02,051
See you at training.

402
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:12,813
So, what are you doing in here?

403
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,936
Sir, they were chasing me.

404
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:17,295
"Sir, they were chasing me. "

405
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:21,658
It's always somebody else's fault,
isn't it?

406
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:26,414
Kids like you make me sick.

407
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:32,058
Detention, rest of the week.

408
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,778
That's not fair!

409
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:37,330
I know. Life is not fair, son.

410
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:43,654
Mullet. Mullet... Mullet's back!

411
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,929
Mullet. Mullet's back.

412
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,818
Mullet's back. Mullet.

413
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:54,655
Yeah, Mullet, Mullet, Mullet.
Did you get that site down? Yeah?

414
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:59,052
- Yeah? All right. Cheers.
- Mullet.

415
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:09,177
- Is it from Mullet?
- Marcus, how many more times?

416
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,693
What's going on?

417
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:13,294
Someone's texting us
off Darren Mullet's phone.

418
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:17,817
- Why would they do that?
- Some sicko's idea of a joke.

419
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:20,289
Everyone back inside now.

420
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:24,373
It's just an unfortunate mishap.
Well, come on, move!

421
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:27,259
- I'm sorry. He looked fucking ridiculous.
- Who did?

422
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:39,015
Oh, touch of hay fever, Jason?

423
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:42,217
I've had the snuffles myself.

424
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,609
- Problem is you've got a screw missing.
- Yes.

425
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:49,817
So, I suggest we go and get lunch
and I'll come back

426
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:52,699
and I'll have it done for you
in two shakes of a lamb's tail.

427
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:55,135
And how long is that, Mister Humpage?

428
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:04,099
- Justine, come out and play.
- I can't. I have a governors' meeting.

429
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,012
You're choosing that over me?

430
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:11,890
- Are you shagging one of them?
- I'm shagging all of them.

431
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:14,210
How do you think I got to be Head Girl?

432
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:16,257
This has got to stop. Right now.

433
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:20,572
OK, I'll end it. But I think I should do it
in person. They've been good to me.

434
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:28,137
Her Highness
doesn't like to be kept waiting.

435
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:36,816
Ah! Come on!

436
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:15,693
You really made me...

437
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:25,854
I mean, he's a great kid.
I'm sure he'll make a full recovery.

438
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:29,569
How about a little figgy oatcake
before your tea?

439
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:58,974
- # I get
- # I get, I get

440
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:02,177
- # What I own
- # Don't let, don't let

441
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:05,571
- # The feelings that I choose
- # I choose, I choose

442
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:08,493
# 'Cause everybody else do...

443
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:13,218
# Gotta get out of the way
No time for me to stay

444
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:17,009
# Everyone in the world
don't affect you...

445
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:20,456
- You OK, Juss?
- Yeah, I didn't sleep too well.

446
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:23,737
Ah, lying awake thinking about me,
were you?

447
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:27,210
You wish.
I've just got things on my mind.

448
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:30,372
What have you got to worry about?

449
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:43,529
Natasha, we are doing everything
in our power to get this taken down.

450
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:46,690
No one is to read this.

451
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:49,499
Don't look at it.

452
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:52,732
No, you, boy, do not look.

453
00:35:56,260 --> 00:36:01,414
Is it true, though? Are you actually
kicking in her back door?

454
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:05,334
- That's my girlfriend, you fucking moron.
- I said not to call me that.

455
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:11,779
- Oh...
- Twat.

456
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:17,016
Oh, I'll be with you in a minute, OK?

457
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:25,689
He says I bullied him.

458
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,491
This is creepy, if it's some sort of...

459
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:31,618
- You think I forged it?
- Well, did you?

460
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:37,693
I bet you like coming to school,
don't you?

461
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:39,612
What's that got to do with anything?

462
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,419
You've got no idea
what it's like to be bullied, do you?

463
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:45,048
Well, I'm sure it's awful.

464
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:48,212
Darren couldn't escape,
even when he was at home.

465
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:50,814
They... they sent him texts, and emails.

466
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,891
- And they set up a website.
- A website?

467
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:56,655
Yeah, can you believe that?
And what's he supposed to do?

468
00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:01,336
You tell a teacher, and they tell the
bullies off, and they come after you.

469
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:06,574
You tell your parents
and they say stand up for yourself.

470
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:09,252
Darren couldn't stand up for himself.

471
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:11,934
So... who bullied him?

472
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:28,815
Everyone outside, come on.

473
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,534
You know you shouldn't be in here.

474
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,691
Justine?

475
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:41,136
What were you
and Jason Banks talking about?

476
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,771
Not here.

477
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:50,898
He gave me this.

478
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,934
- What have we got here?
- Oi.

479
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,738
Ha!

480
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:05,095
- Fuck me. It's Mullet's suicide note.
- Bradley, don't.

481
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:09,333
Oh, chillax,
I've never seen one of these before.

482
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:13,858
Oh, fuck.
He really did love you, didn't he?

483
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:16,693
Brad, just fucking give it back.

484
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:20,375
I think you've got
a bit of stiff competition.

485
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:23,575
I don't think Darren
would have been your type.

486
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:26,971
- Does he mention any names?
- Um...

487
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:33,771
Only Justine.

488
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:37,899
Justine,
have you been bullying Darren Mullet?

489
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:40,938
Shut up, Tasha.
Can't you see she's upset?

490
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,819
- Do you know who was picking on him?
- Why should we know about it?

491
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:47,131
You're not accusing us of anything,
right, Justine?

492
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,814
No, she's not.

493
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:53,017
- I should show this to someone.
- Oh.

494
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:55,899
Well, that might not be
such a good idea.

495
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:59,257
- It's got your name on it.
- But I didn't do anything.

496
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:03,857
- We know that, but he says you did.
- And it is your word against his.

497
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:06,773
And, uh... since he's dead...

498
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:09,613
Well, I can't just ignore it.

499
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:33,336
- You shouldn't have done that.
- It's what friends are for.

500
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:42,179
'She was my angel
and I will watch over her for all eternity.

501
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:44,934
'Goodbye. Darren. '

502
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:50,254
' Help, I'm lost in your ass!
Help, I'm lost in your ass! '

503
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:54,333
- This is getting really, really old.
- 'Help... '

504
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:58,095
I'll tell you who it is.
It's that she-male Helena.

505
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:03,380
Yeah. I heard she said you were
an ugly bitch at the funeral.

506
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:06,771
- She what?
- And that you had chubby thighs.

507
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:08,896
Are we going to do
something about this?

508
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:12,575
Yeah, because it's beginning
to get right up my arse.

509
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:16,335
- Right up your arse.
- Get off me.

510
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:20,213
- Helena wouldn't do that.
- Oh, yeah. I forgot.

511
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:25,329
The two of you
are like bestest bosom buddies.

512
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,412
What are you going to do?

513
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:33,017
Ask her ever so politely
what the fuck she thinks she's playing at.

514
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,136
Are you coming, or what?

515
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:39,169
I... I can't, I've got prefect duty.

516
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:42,332
Oh, God bless you, Mary Poppins.

517
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:46,612
Sorry.

518
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:59,332
- God, she's really quiet, isn't she?
- Smells like she's having a poo.

519
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:03,334
She always smells like that 'cause she's
got her head so far up Justine's arse.

520
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:07,095
Now, now, Khalilah. We all know
Justine's shit doesn't stink, don't we?

521
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:08,613
No.

522
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:12,898
- I bet she's having a wank.
- Eugh, dirty cow.

523
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:17,929
Hey, Helena are you in
up to the wrist in there?

524
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:24,092
What do you want?

525
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:26,774
I want world peace.

526
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:29,056
I want Prada shoes

527
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:34,613
and I wanna know why you've been
texting us, you stupid geeky little bitch.

528
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:37,692
- What are you talking about?
- You sending us texts.

529
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:41,455
- Why would I?
- Because you're a twisted dyke slut.

530
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:45,579
- How would I know?
- Why don't you grow up?

531
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:47,651
Ow! Ow!

532
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:49,651
Sophie.

533
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:54,018
Sorry, we're closed. You're just going
to have to cross those little legs.

534
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:56,614
Ow! No!

535
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:59,692
- That's mine!
- Look at this piece of shit.

536
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:03,569
- Must have come from the pound shop.
- Give it back.

537
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:07,490
It's not like you needed it anyway.

538
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:11,494
You only need a phone
if you've got friends to talk to.

539
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:20,699
Oh, and when was the last time
Justine called you, anyway?

540
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:28,534
'Where have you been? '

541
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:31,330
I've been looking for Helena.
What did you guys do to her?

542
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,138
Do to her?

543
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,131
Um...

544
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:37,256
Oh, yeah.

545
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:41,971
We just asked her if she would please
stop sending those nasty texts.

546
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:43,493
Yeah, it was kind of upsetting.

547
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:47,448
- What was Darren to you guys?
- Um... nothing.

548
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:50,339
Just Shrek.

549
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:53,731
Big, fat, ugly Shrek.

550
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:56,619
You really don't remember him?

551
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:58,896
I don't think so.

552
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:01,813
He was pretty hard to miss.
He was fucking huge.

553
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:07,697
Hey, hey, hey, hey. What about
last week in the common room

554
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:10,420
when the guys took his asthma thingy

555
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:15,370
and he was going,
"Ughh! I can't breathe!"

556
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:21,216
"I can't breathe! I can't breathe!

557
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:24,338
"I can't breathe!
I can't breathe, Justine!"

558
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:30,136
- I'm really glad we can be friends now.
- Me too.

559
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:34,009
We couldn't before, obviously, 'cause
Tasha said you were an ugly dyke,

560
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:35,772
but that's not true, is it?

561
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:40,331
You did surprise us with the Alexis thing.
Are you guys going to have sex tonight?

562
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:43,776
Sophie,
he's only coming round to watch a film.

563
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:47,933
Watch a film? He'll be wanting
to have a shag. Boys always do.

564
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:50,568
If you're nervous,
you could just give him a hand job.

565
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:53,413
Yeah, it can get really messy, can't it?

566
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:57,778
No, you're better off just having a shag.
Less cleaning up to do.

567
00:43:57,940 --> 00:43:59,771
Oh, fuck! I forgot my watch again.

568
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:05,094
OK, I would like to know
all the gory details tomorrow, please.

569
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:07,410
Good luck, you'll need it.

570
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:09,571
Thanks.

571
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:28,772
Hello.

572
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:31,454
Hi, I can see you.

573
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:35,613
Are you perving on me? Look,
I'm flattered that you're stalking me...

574
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:38,089
Mullet? What the fuck?

575
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:05,611
- For you.
- Thank you.

576
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:14,416
Al, you're going to hate me
for bringing this up.

577
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:21,531
OK, so Jason Banks said
there's a website about Darren Mullet?

578
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:25,209
Yeah. Um...

579
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:28,770
The site was Bradley's idea.

580
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:33,252
It... it started out as a joke,
and it just got way out of hand.

581
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:35,775
Were you involved?

582
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:39,137
I try not to get mixed up in Bradley's shit
but you know what he's like. He...

583
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:41,768
The other night with the chainsaw?

584
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:44,329
- Already on the web.
- I don't want anyone to see that.

585
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:47,412
Yeah, how do you think I feel?
I'm screaming like a girl.

586
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:50,219
Yeah, where was my knight
in shining armour?

587
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:52,530
Yeah, OK.

588
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:54,452
It wasn't my finest hour

589
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:59,335
but if it happened for real
I'd protect you.

590
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:01,172
I promise.

591
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:14,649
At least we don't have to worry
about Bradley bursting in on us.

592
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:19,736
I'm just going to check
I locked the back door.

593
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:38,654
Hey.

594
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:41,812
So, did you find Bradley?

595
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:44,448
Hiding in the garden, was he?

596
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:47,532
I'm sorry.

597
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:50,168
I'm just a bit nervous.

598
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:52,331
Really?

599
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:55,253
Well, you don't need to be.

600
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:06,333
# Your lights in the tall grass

601
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:09,253
# Covered in coal

602
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:19,860
# I'm reaching for you

603
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:22,978
# Hoping to hold you

604
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:33,650
# I won't give up
No, I won't give up

605
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:37,096
# Not until I'm holding you

606
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:46,530
# I won't lie down, I won't lie down

607
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:50,534
# Not until I'm holding you... #

608
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:52,975
Are you OK?

609
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:34,531
- I had a really nice night.
- Me too.

610
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:40,093
I can usually
make it last longer than that.

611
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:42,376
Next time.

612
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:43,859
I'm joking.

613
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:46,011
- But seriously.
- No.

614
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:49,217
No, I was... I'm... I'm joking.

615
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:51,416
But seriously, I can.

616
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:53,457
It was good.

617
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:03,252
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Bye.

618
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:55,492
So, er... did you seal the deal last night?

619
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:57,935
Might have done.

620
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:06,016
What did she smell like?

621
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:10,217
- Did she suck your cock?
- A gentleman doesn't go into details.

622
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:13,019
Well, I'll take that as a no, then.

623
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:16,776
Al.

624
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:20,694
- Head girl on heat alert.
- I had a really lovely time last night.

625
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:24,091
- You didn't bring me flowers, did you?
- No, was I supposed to?

626
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:26,899
No, somebody rearranged
the fridge magnets.

627
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:30,973
- Yeah, I was just fooling around.
- I think someone was in the house.

628
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:33,608
- Who?
- You didn't let someone in?

629
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:35,736
No. I wouldn't do that to you, Juss.

630
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:38,698
Are you two having a...
having a lovers' tiff?

631
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:41,932
- It was you, wasn't it?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

632
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:44,739
Oh, Bradley, you are so fucking childish.

633
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:46,333
You better put a muzzle
on that bitch of yours.

634
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:51,972
- What did you just say?
- Put a muzzle on that bitch of yours.

635
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:54,574
Bradley, get off, mate. Get off him.

636
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:57,129
Get off him.

637
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:58,415
Off him!

638
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:01,094
Come on, let's get out of here.

639
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:04,735
Fuck!

640
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:14,698
I went to visit Naz in hospital

641
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:17,977
and I took my iPod 'cause I thought
he'd want to listen to some tunes.

642
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:21,371
And I realised he's like totally deaf.

643
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:23,974
Now he can't listen to Jodie Phister

644
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:28,611
or Crying While Wanking
or the Crotch Eating Bears.

645
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:32,170
He'll never hear any of them ever again.

646
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:35,935
Twenty mil. Semi counter sunk.

647
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:38,489
It's just the job.

648
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:43,015
- Is there a problem, Mr Humpage?
- I've brought the wrong screwdriver.

649
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:45,853
That's Philips. That's not.

650
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:53,099
Gordon. Gordon.

651
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:57,219
- Head down.
- Gordon!

652
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:58,859
Gordon.

653
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:02,774
- So, I hear congratulations are in order.
- Gordon!

654
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:06,012
Well, you popped the Pringle
for sexy Lexy last night, right?

655
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:07,659
He told you?

656
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:11,017
Well, he hasn't stopped talking about it
all morning.

657
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:15,852
Discipline, lads, discipline!

658
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:21,253
Gordon, I... I thought I'd give everybody
the last two periods off.

659
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:27,858
It might help to raise the school spirits
after these unfortunate events.

660
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:29,373
Yeah, right.

661
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:32,612
Boys, we've got a semifinal Saturday!

662
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:36,170
What are you doing?
You can't hit a barn door.

663
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:39,093
- Was it your first time?
- No.

664
00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:43,538
Oh, my God, it was.
Oh, that's so cute.

665
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:46,851
So... so was it really magical?

666
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:48,897
Was it really worth waiting for?

667
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:52,848
Was it over really quickly?
'Cause it was when I did it with him.

668
00:53:55,060 --> 00:53:57,938
Dirty little slut gave me crabs.

669
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:00,568
I had to shave the panty hamster.

670
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:04,415
He said he got them from Sophie,
but I think it was the other way round.

671
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:07,652
Have you seen her?
I've been texting her all day.

672
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:09,412
No.

673
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:12,856
Alexis, heel to toe! Come on.

674
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:19,256
All right, ladies, come on. No one is to
go into the water until I say so, all right?

675
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:31,019
Lads.

676
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:33,978
Saturday. Parkside, semifinal.

677
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:36,734
Big day. This is the ball.

678
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:42,738
Bradley, I want you to hit him.
Let him know you're there. Early doors.

679
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:44,856
Show him who's boss, OK?

680
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:47,614
Where's Marcus?

681
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:50,499
Mar... Marcus!

682
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:52,412
Marcus!

683
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:56,300
It's Shrek!

684
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:59,452
- It's Mullet! It's Mullet, it's Mullet!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

685
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:02,418
Listen to me. Calm down, boy.
What's the matter with you?

686
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:06,289
Is this your... is this your idea of trying
to help the team? Team morale?

687
00:55:06,460 --> 00:55:08,098
This is not good for the team, son.

688
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:11,855
Now, what I want you to do, I want you
to go and have a shower, get changed...

689
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:15,569
- But, sir, I...
- You've disappointed me a little bit, son.

690
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:19,210
Now, go and get changed and
come and see me after practice, OK?

691
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:22,770
- I saw him, sir.
- I'm disappointed in you a little bit. Go.

692
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:24,658
Go.

693
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:28,130
I see dead people. I see dead people.

694
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:31,178
All right, lads, give me the ball.

695
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:32,978
- I couldn't do anything.
- I want a word with you.

696
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:36,052
- You've got to come.
- I understand.

697
00:55:36,220 --> 00:55:37,858
- She's face down.
- I understand.

698
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:41,774
- Please come with me.
- She's probably swimming. Swimming.

699
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:21,936
'You're a dumb fuck.

700
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:25,456
' You're a dumb fuck.

701
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:29,499
' You're a dumb fuck. '

702
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:42,860
If someone's dicking me about...

703
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:03,974
Agh! Agh!

704
00:57:05,740 --> 00:57:07,776
Agh! Oh!

705
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:10,056
You fucker!

706
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:14,176
Agh!

707
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:29,812
Die!

708
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:45,575
Oh. Oh, God.

709
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:53,370
Oh, God.

710
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:57,408
Agh! Come on, come on!

711
00:57:57,580 --> 00:58:00,219
Come on.

712
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:04,055
Ah!

713
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:06,654
Ah! Ah!

714
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:08,697
Ah! Ah!

715
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:10,930
Ah! Ah!

716
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:12,931
Oh...

717
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:22,491
Oh.

718
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:27,170
Ugh.

719
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:34,018
Ugh.

720
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:39,014
Oh, crap.

721
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:52,534
So which do you fancy? Keira in
'Atonement' or Keira in 'Doctor Zhivago'?

722
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:56,136
Emily! Emily! He's trying to rape you!

723
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:59,531
- Get off her, you pig!
- Agh! Agh! Agh!

724
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:03,970
The boys in this school
are so disgusting.

725
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:12,177
- Mullet said he was going to kill them.
- We did treat him like shit.

726
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:16,379
It's not Darren Mullet. For fuck's sake,
am I the only one who can see this?

727
01:00:16,540 --> 01:00:18,576
You said you didn't do anything.

728
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:21,812
Nice one, Alex.
You got her to believe that?

729
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:25,254
I'm proud of you, bro.

730
01:00:25,420 --> 01:00:28,776
- Juss, I can explain it.
- What did that poor boy ever do to you?

731
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:32,171
You wanna know why we picked on him?

732
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:35,650
We were bored. He was a spaz.

733
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:37,890
You do the math.

734
01:00:38,060 --> 01:00:40,813
- I'm so glad I'm not like you.
- Suck my cock, you prissy bitch.

735
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:43,050
You look down your nose at everyone

736
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:45,495
but you spread your legs
just like the rest of us.

737
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:48,732
- Come on.
- Get your hands off me, you slut!

738
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:58,938
- Bradley, give me a hand!
- None of my business, bro.

739
01:01:07,180 --> 01:01:09,375
Bradley, will you do something?

740
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:23,852
This isn't over! You're dead!

741
01:01:24,020 --> 01:01:26,409
We're all dead! He's gonna kill us!

742
01:01:26,580 --> 01:01:28,536
He's dead, OK?

743
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:32,249
He's fucking dead!
And I'm gonna prove it.

744
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:35,856
- Yeah, right. How you gonna do that?
- I'm gonna dig that fucker up.

745
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:37,738
Bradley! For fuck's sake.

746
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:39,856
Bradley?

747
01:02:10,820 --> 01:02:14,256
All right, Mullet, you fat fuck,
let's take a look at you.

748
01:02:16,060 --> 01:02:18,369
Justine.

749
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:21,134
I want to see this website.

750
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:25,577
All the harmless fun and games you had.

751
01:02:25,740 --> 01:02:28,254
- You don't want to see it.
- Alex, I really do.

752
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:35,058
'Now, here we see the lesser
spotted Mullet at feeding time. '

753
01:02:35,220 --> 01:02:38,815
'Mullet! Mullet! '

754
01:02:39,860 --> 01:02:41,771
'Mullet, come on. '

755
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:43,373
'Get the fat boy! '

756
01:02:43,540 --> 01:02:45,496
'Come on! '

757
01:02:46,620 --> 01:02:50,408
'Come on!
Fight back, Mullet, fight back. Come on.

758
01:02:50,580 --> 01:02:52,889
'Come on. '

759
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:54,209
Please turn it off.

760
01:02:54,380 --> 01:02:57,099
'Did you get that? Are you getting that? '

761
01:02:57,260 --> 01:03:00,570
'OK, now we need to be very quiet

762
01:03:00,740 --> 01:03:05,256
'because we are here to observe
the courtship rituals of the Mullet.

763
01:03:06,860 --> 01:03:11,172
'Ooh, the Mullet has fallen
for a very rare species.

764
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:16,778
'Head girlus, frigidus bitchus.
Now, let's see what happens. '

765
01:03:16,940 --> 01:03:20,137
'Come on, big boy. This way.

766
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:24,254
'Go on, you can do it.

767
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:28,135
'Oh, he stinks. '

768
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:35,014
Get off me, you creep.
What's wrong with you?

769
01:03:35,180 --> 01:03:37,216
- What are you doing?
- I'm so sorry, Justine.

770
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:41,658
- No, it's OK. It's no one.
- Darren, mate, what are you playing at?

771
01:03:41,820 --> 01:03:44,288
That's the Head Girl.
You can look but nobody...

772
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:46,894
I can't believe
I'm actually going to Oxford.

773
01:03:47,060 --> 01:03:50,132
- This is disgusting. Eugh.
- Eugh.

774
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:53,770
- Oh, I haven't got it.
- Ah, diddums. Baby gonna cry?

775
01:03:53,940 --> 01:03:59,458
Do you know what? It's so cute when
guys can really show their emotions.

776
01:04:01,860 --> 01:04:04,738
I don't know. You'd better ask Helen.

777
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:10,577
- Justine, please help me!
- I did just get into Oxford.

778
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:14,449
Justine, make...
make them give it back to me. Please.

779
01:04:14,620 --> 01:04:17,896
- I'm on the phone. Leave me alone.
- Come on, Darren.

780
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:24,176
'Darren, look. '

781
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:34,212
'Breathe, breathe. '

782
01:04:36,220 --> 01:04:38,415
I don't want you in my house any more.

783
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:44,651
- Juss, I'm not like them, OK?
- No, you're so much worse.

784
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:48,130
At least Bradley's honest
about who he is.

785
01:04:49,580 --> 01:04:54,017
You don't understand! Nobody ever says
no to Bradley. I didn't have a choice.

786
01:04:54,180 --> 01:04:57,058
Don't you dare touch me!
Just get out of my house!

787
01:04:57,220 --> 01:04:59,017
- Let me explain!
- Alex, get out!

788
01:04:59,180 --> 01:05:02,809
- No, let me explain!
- Get out of my house!

789
01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:13,372
Whoopsy.

790
01:05:15,740 --> 01:05:18,618
Bradley, come on. Shall we just go?

791
01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:22,978
'Cause it's gonna take you hours
to get down to his coffin

792
01:05:23,140 --> 01:05:26,177
and this is a total dick dance.

793
01:05:31,380 --> 01:05:34,099
Why the fuck did Marcus have to die?

794
01:05:38,060 --> 01:05:41,416
And Sophie. And fucking everyone!

795
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:46,056
Bradley. Hey.

796
01:05:46,220 --> 01:05:48,859
Come on, Brad.

797
01:05:49,020 --> 01:05:51,853
Why is... why is this happening to us?

798
01:05:52,020 --> 01:05:56,571
You tell me why this is
fucking happening to us!

799
01:05:56,740 --> 01:06:00,938
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.

800
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:03,375
Hey. Come here, come here.

801
01:06:03,540 --> 01:06:05,496
Look at you.

802
01:06:05,660 --> 01:06:09,096
Come here.

803
01:06:12,980 --> 01:06:15,369
Fuck Darren Mullet.

804
01:06:18,460 --> 01:06:20,451
OK?

805
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:47,809
Hm. Come here.

806
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:51,255
Yeah.

807
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:06,815
Yeah.

808
01:07:06,980 --> 01:07:09,016
Oh, Bradley.

809
01:07:23,700 --> 01:07:26,214
Oh.

810
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:28,371
Get it in.

811
01:07:34,540 --> 01:07:36,371
Fuck...

812
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:42,731
Yeah.

813
01:07:56,380 --> 01:07:57,972
Bradley.

814
01:07:58,980 --> 01:08:01,574
Bradley! Bradley!

815
01:08:01,740 --> 01:08:04,413
Bradley, it's... it's Darren Mullet!

816
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:07,652
Bradley, it's fucking Darren Mullet!
Bradley!

817
01:08:10,460 --> 01:08:12,212
Agh!

818
01:08:17,900 --> 01:08:19,970
Shit!

819
01:08:20,140 --> 01:08:22,529
No!

820
01:08:23,660 --> 01:08:25,139
Tasha.

821
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:32,858
Tasha.

822
01:08:35,580 --> 01:08:37,775
Tasha.

823
01:08:37,940 --> 01:08:39,931
Tasha. Don't leave me.

824
01:08:55,180 --> 01:08:57,455
Fuck.

825
01:08:59,060 --> 01:09:01,528
Look.

826
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:04,533
Look, I'm really... I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

827
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:08,534
We shouldn't...
We were just joking around.

828
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:11,658
And anyway, it was the others
that didn't like you, not me.

829
01:09:11,820 --> 01:09:13,811
I always... I always liked you.

830
01:09:16,020 --> 01:09:17,817
Actually, I kind of...

831
01:09:17,980 --> 01:09:20,858
I kind of fancied you.

832
01:09:21,020 --> 01:09:24,376
I... I wanted to go out with you

833
01:09:24,540 --> 01:09:26,974
but... but I was too scared to ask

834
01:09:27,140 --> 01:09:30,052
and that... that's the truth, OK?

835
01:09:33,580 --> 01:09:35,935
I would have gone out with you...

836
01:09:37,660 --> 01:09:40,128
and... and...

837
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:42,256
and maybe...

838
01:09:42,420 --> 01:09:45,571
maybe it's not too late!

839
01:10:02,940 --> 01:10:06,012
- Now, that's interesting.
- Guv, I think you should see this.

840
01:10:06,180 --> 01:10:09,092
- What you got?
- A condom. A full one.

841
01:10:09,260 --> 01:10:12,172
- At least he got his rocks off.
- No, Guv.

842
01:10:12,340 --> 01:10:14,979
It's full of his dick.

843
01:10:15,140 --> 01:10:17,700
Fucking spiders, look at that.

844
01:10:30,220 --> 01:10:32,290
...Justine...

845
01:11:03,980 --> 01:11:05,891
Jason.

846
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:10,298
I came to say I'm sorry.

847
01:11:10,460 --> 01:11:15,614
I saw Darren being bullied
and I didn't do anything to help him.

848
01:11:15,780 --> 01:11:21,650
And I'm starting to think
that maybe it was my fault.

849
01:11:21,820 --> 01:11:24,129
It wasn't you.

850
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:27,171
It... it was me.

851
01:11:29,140 --> 01:11:31,529
I was the one
that told them he fancied you.

852
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:36,649
I didn't want them to start on me,
so I set him up. Some friend, huh?

853
01:11:36,820 --> 01:11:39,380
Well, I'm going to go and see the Head.

854
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:43,292
Tell him what happened to Darren.

855
01:11:43,460 --> 01:11:46,054
It's not going to bring him back.

856
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:02,773
I need to talk to you.

857
01:12:02,940 --> 01:12:05,408
I don't think we have
anything to discuss.

858
01:12:05,580 --> 01:12:08,014
Look, Alexis turned out to be...

859
01:12:08,180 --> 01:12:10,216
I hate to say I told you so.

860
01:12:10,380 --> 01:12:12,610
Please, Helena.

861
01:12:12,780 --> 01:12:14,532
I need a friend.

862
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:16,816
Well, you're in luck.

863
01:12:16,980 --> 01:12:19,494
- Do you know where Tasha is?
- No, I don't care.

864
01:12:19,660 --> 01:12:21,537
I've been calling her all morning.

865
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:23,975
Your friend practically pulled my ear off.

866
01:12:24,140 --> 01:12:25,937
- I'm so sorry.
- You were my best friend.

867
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:28,819
Justine, it's OK,
Tasha wants to meet me in the art room.

868
01:12:28,980 --> 01:12:31,858
What? I've just...
I've just come from there.

869
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:38,098
Look, I haven't changed,
I'm still the same old Justine.

870
01:12:38,260 --> 01:12:42,572
Maybe that's the problem. The only
person you care about is yourself.

871
01:12:42,740 --> 01:12:45,300
- That's not fair.
- It's not, is it?

872
01:12:48,620 --> 01:12:50,451
Emily.

873
01:12:53,340 --> 01:12:56,696
I'm sorry, Darren. I know I let you down.

874
01:12:56,860 --> 01:12:59,374
I'm so sorry, I was just so scared.

875
01:13:09,180 --> 01:13:14,652
- We found it by the bodies.
- I dare say there is an explanation.

876
01:13:14,820 --> 01:13:17,653
We think it got ripped off in the struggle.

877
01:13:25,260 --> 01:13:27,216
Tash?

878
01:13:27,380 --> 01:13:29,530
Where are you?

879
01:13:38,420 --> 01:13:41,651
That doesn't look like me.

880
01:13:49,180 --> 01:13:51,614
Justine.

881
01:13:51,780 --> 01:13:53,657
Come here.

882
01:13:59,660 --> 01:14:02,220
- What's that for?
- I need it to protect us.

883
01:14:02,380 --> 01:14:05,099
- Protect us from what?
- From Mullet.

884
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:07,615
You're scaring me.

885
01:14:07,780 --> 01:14:10,658
- Bradley and Tasha, they're both dead.
- No, they're not.

886
01:14:10,820 --> 01:14:13,334
They're in pieces, Justine.
He's cut them into bits.

887
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:15,775
Stop it. They're not dead.

888
01:14:15,940 --> 01:14:21,697
- Tasha's in the art room.
- You saw her?

889
01:14:21,860 --> 01:14:25,853
No, well, she sent Kally a text
telling her to meet her there.

890
01:14:29,780 --> 01:14:32,852
- Where are you going?
- To kill Darren Mullet.

891
01:14:44,260 --> 01:14:46,569
What did I ever do to you?

892
01:14:46,740 --> 01:14:50,050
'Fight, fight, fight! Fight, fight, fight!

893
01:14:50,220 --> 01:14:53,292
'Fight, fight, fight, fight!
Fight, fight, fight! '

894
01:14:53,460 --> 01:14:56,258
Fight, fight, fight, fight,
fight, fight, fight!

895
01:14:56,420 --> 01:15:00,015
- Fight back, you bitch!
- Oh-ho! Back of the net!

896
01:15:00,180 --> 01:15:03,570
Fight, fight, fight!
Fight, fight, fight, fight!

897
01:15:03,740 --> 01:15:08,018
Come on, then, Mullet, you spaz.
Getting beaten up by a girl, are we?

898
01:15:08,180 --> 01:15:10,774
Here, just give me your face.

899
01:15:10,940 --> 01:15:13,454
'Fight, fight, fight!
Fight, fight, fight, fight!

900
01:15:13,620 --> 01:15:15,053
'Fight, fight, fight!

901
01:15:15,220 --> 01:15:17,290
It was just happy slapping.

902
01:15:17,460 --> 01:15:20,179
Please, no. Please. No, please.

903
01:15:21,820 --> 01:15:23,333
This is crazy.

904
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:25,934
He's gonna kill her, Justine.
Don't you understand?

905
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:29,172
- Tell someone I need help.
- Do your own dirty work.

906
01:15:45,100 --> 01:15:46,613
Hello?

907
01:15:48,860 --> 01:15:51,135
Help me, please, somebody!

908
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:54,849
Stay off this line. We don't have time
for silly games today, young lady!

909
01:15:57,660 --> 01:16:00,015
Where are the pupils
we want to speak to?

910
01:16:04,620 --> 01:16:06,611
Oh, my God. Kally.

911
01:16:16,620 --> 01:16:21,091
- Alex, phone an ambulance.
- It's too late, he's already here.

912
01:16:21,260 --> 01:16:24,093
It wasn't Darren Mullet!
Just phone an ambulance!

913
01:16:24,260 --> 01:16:27,457
- But it was him.
- No, it wasn't, Alex. He's dead.

914
01:16:29,940 --> 01:16:32,090
I know that, Juss.

915
01:16:34,180 --> 01:16:37,456
- But he's standing right behind you.
- Oh, God.

916
01:16:38,460 --> 01:16:41,930
- Darren?
- Darren, mate.

917
01:16:42,100 --> 01:16:49,780
I'm sorry, OK? It was a joke.
Can't you take a fucking joke?

918
01:16:49,940 --> 01:16:52,374
- Help! Help us!
- Oi!

919
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:10,295
Die!

920
01:17:18,380 --> 01:17:19,608
Run!

921
01:17:23,380 --> 01:17:25,371
Window.

922
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:40,136
What are we going to do?

923
01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:43,570
It wasn't all lies, you know.

924
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:47,060
The things that I said to you,
they weren't all lies.

925
01:17:47,220 --> 01:17:49,097
I know.

926
01:19:01,020 --> 01:19:03,136
Aaah!

927
01:19:10,660 --> 01:19:12,696
Alex, smash it!

928
01:19:24,380 --> 01:19:26,848
What's the matter, Mullet?
Having trouble breathing?

929
01:19:27,020 --> 01:19:29,898
Alex, come on. Let's get out of here.

930
01:19:32,180 --> 01:19:34,216
Not so hard now, are you?

931
01:19:43,340 --> 01:19:45,376
Oh, shit.

932
01:19:47,460 --> 01:19:49,178
Run, Justine, go!

933
01:20:05,380 --> 01:20:08,895
Darren, no! Please don't hurt him.

934
01:20:09,060 --> 01:20:12,450
I let you down. I was the one
that should have helped you.

935
01:20:13,900 --> 01:20:16,175
Oh, no!

936
01:20:16,340 --> 01:20:18,854
Justine.

937
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:24,016
Help me.

938
01:20:42,860 --> 01:20:45,328
Help me.

939
01:20:46,340 --> 01:20:50,538
I see you, Darren.
Is that what you wanted?

940
01:20:51,660 --> 01:20:53,571
And you know what?

941
01:20:53,740 --> 01:20:56,174
You do look like fucking Shrek!

942
01:21:16,620 --> 01:21:19,259
Justine. What have you done?

943
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:17,809
Can any of you boys

944
01:23:17,980 --> 01:23:19,698
tell me

945
01:23:19,860 --> 01:23:23,694
why that stupid little bitch

946
01:23:24,940 --> 01:23:28,330
had to kill all my best players?

947
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:33,620
I mean, why couldn't she have done us
all a favour and killed you lot instead?

948
01:23:33,780 --> 01:23:35,657
Hey?

949
01:23:36,780 --> 01:23:39,055
Out you go.

950
01:23:39,220 --> 01:23:41,415
Keep your discipline.

951
01:23:41,580 --> 01:23:43,616
Let's get 'em.

952
01:23:46,100 --> 01:23:48,170
Oi.

953
01:23:48,340 --> 01:23:50,058
Oi!

954
01:23:51,060 --> 01:23:54,018
Why aren't you changed
with the others? Have you got a note?

955
01:23:54,180 --> 01:23:57,411
'Cause if you haven't got a note,
you can get yourself ch...

956
01:24:00,180 --> 01:24:03,377
Dear Mr Ramsey,
Darren can't do games today

957
01:24:03,540 --> 01:24:05,451
because he is dead.

958
01:24:09,180 --> 01:24:13,378
What is this, a joke, son? Is this meant
to be funny? Because if you've...

959
01:24:13,580 --> 01:24:14,899
Oh, fuck.
