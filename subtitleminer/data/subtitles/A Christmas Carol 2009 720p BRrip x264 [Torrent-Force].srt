1
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,406
Yes.

2
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:56,658
Quite dead.

3
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,579
As a doornail.

4
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,001
Certificate of death, sir.

5
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,615
Stop!

6
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:20,993
Back away, praddock.

7
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:34,923
Tuppence is tuppence.

8
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:00,824
- Beg your pardon!
- I say!

9
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:42,950
Delinquents.

10
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,369
Newspaper!

11
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,562
We're hungry, sir!

12
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:58,859
- Please, sir, we're very hungry.
- Any morsel. We're hungry, sir.

13
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:00,652
- Any scraps.
- We're starving,

14
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,487
Please, sir. We're very hungry.

15
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:07,367
Merry Christmas,
from his lordship, the mayor!

16
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:10,037
- Please, sir.
- Oh, look. There it is.

17
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:12,414
Oi! Come back here with that!
That's our meat!

18
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:14,708
Give it back! That's ours!
Come back here!

19
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:38,899
- There you are, sir.
- Thanks.

20
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:40,859
Fresh hot chestnuts.

21
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:43,445
- How would you like this one?
- That's perfect.

22
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,782
That's a nice fresh eel.

23
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:50,118
Here is the Father, the Son
and the Holy Ghost. Get lost.

24
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:53,831
And under which one is the pea?
Boom, boom, boom, boom...

25
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:55,499
Boom! Get out of here.

26
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,584
There we are. Watch this now.

27
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,403
Merry Christmas, Uncle!

28
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:52,741
- God save you.
- Bah! Humbug!

29
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:55,702
Christmas a humbug?
Uncle! You don't mean that.

30
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,038
Merry Christmas.

31
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,624
What reason have you to be merry?
You're poor enough.

32
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:03,168
What right have you to be so dismal?
You're rich enough.

33
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:06,880
- Humbug!
- Don't be cross, Uncle.

34
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:11,635
What else can I be when I live
in such a world of fools as this?

35
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:13,762
Merry Christmas.

36
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:18,183
What's Christmastime to you but
a time for paying bills without money.

37
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:22,062
A time for finding yourself a year older
and not a penny richer.

38
00:09:22,104 --> 00:09:23,689
If I could work my will,

39
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,984
every idiot who goes about
with "Merry Christmas" on his lips

40
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,027
should be boiled in his own pudding

41
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:31,113
and buried with a stake of holly
through his heart!

42
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:33,073
- Uncle!
- Nephew!

43
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:37,953
Keep Christmas in your own way
and let me keep it in mine.

44
00:09:37,995 --> 00:09:40,873
Keep it? But you don't keep it!

45
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:44,543
Let me leave it alone then.

46
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:47,796
Much good it has ever done you.

47
00:09:47,838 --> 00:09:51,592
There are many things from which I have
derived good and have not profited.

48
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:54,303
Christmas being among them.

49
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:57,806
But I have always thought of Christmas
as a kind, charitable time.

50
00:09:57,848 --> 00:10:00,225
The only time when men
open their shut-up hearts

51
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:02,978
and think of all people
as fellow travellers to the grave

52
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:06,773
and not some other race of creatures
bound on other journeys.

53
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:08,859
And therefore, Uncle,

54
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:13,405
although it has never put a scrap
of gold or silver in my pocket,

55
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:17,492
I believe it has done me good,
and I say, God bless it!

56
00:10:19,745 --> 00:10:22,664
Let me hear another
sound out of you, Cratchit,

57
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:26,293
and you'll keep Christmas
by losing your situation!

58
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:35,928
You're quite a powerful speaker, sir.
A wonder you don't go into Parliament.

59
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:39,890
Don't be cross, Uncle.
Come, dine with us tomorrow.

60
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:42,768
I'll see you in hell first.

61
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:46,647
But why?
Why so cold-hearted, Uncle? Why?

62
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:50,192
Why did you get married?

63
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:54,863
Because I fell in love.

64
00:10:56,073 --> 00:10:57,407
Because...

65
00:10:58,534 --> 00:11:00,160
...you fell...

66
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:04,039
...in love?

67
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:10,879
Good afternoon.

68
00:11:11,547 --> 00:11:15,634
I want nothing from you.
I ask nothing of you.

69
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:18,554
- Why can't we be friends?
- Good afternoon.

70
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:23,058
I'm sorry, with all my heart,
to find you so resolute.

71
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,811
But I have made the trial
in homage to Christmas, and therefore,

72
00:11:25,853 --> 00:11:28,480
- merry Christmas, Uncle!
- Good afternoon!

73
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:31,066
- And a happy New Year!
- Good afternoon!

74
00:11:31,108 --> 00:11:33,819
And a very merry Christmas
to you too, Mr Cratchit.

75
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:35,737
Merry Christmas to you, sir.

76
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:37,906
There's another one.

77
00:11:38,657 --> 00:11:41,660
A clerk making 15 shillings a week...

78
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:46,081
...and with a wife and family,
talking about a merry Christmas.

79
00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:47,958
I'll retire to Bedlam.

80
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,087
Good afternoon.
Scrooge and Marley's, I believe?

81
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:59,845
Have I the pleasure of addressing
Mr Scrooge or Mr Marley?

82
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:02,598
Mr Marley has been dead
these seven years.

83
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:07,519
He died seven years ago...
this very night.

84
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:12,357
Well, we have no doubt
that his generosity

85
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,235
is well represented
by his surviving partner.

86
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:19,656
At this festive season
of the year, Mr Scrooge,

87
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:24,369
it is more than usually desirable that
we should make some slight provision

88
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:26,788
for the poor and the destitute.

89
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:31,126
Many thousands are in want
of common comfort, sir.

90
00:12:37,341 --> 00:12:39,092
Are there no prisons?

91
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:46,391
Prisons? Yes, yes, plenty of prisons.

92
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:51,939
And the union workhouses,
are they still in operation?

93
00:12:52,898 --> 00:12:56,401
They are. I wish
I could say they were not.

94
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:58,654
The treadmill in full vigour?

95
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:02,407
- Very busy, sir.
- Good!

96
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:06,703
I was afraid something had occurred
to stop them in their useful course.

97
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:14,545
Yes. At this festive season, a few
of us are endeavouring to raise a fund

98
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:19,091
to buy the poor some meat
and drink and means of warmth.

99
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,260
What shall we put you down for?

100
00:13:22,553 --> 00:13:26,306
- Nothing.
- Oh, you wish to remain anonymous?

101
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:30,227
I wish to be left alone!
I don't make merry myself at Christmas,

102
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:33,355
and I can't afford
to make idle people merry.

103
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,942
I support the establishments
I have mentioned.

104
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:40,028
And those who are badly off
must go there.

105
00:13:42,865 --> 00:13:45,158
Many cannot go there.

106
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:50,038
And, well, frankly,
many would rather die.

107
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:54,168
Then they had better do it
and decrease the surplus population.

108
00:13:58,714 --> 00:14:00,757
Good afternoon, gentlemen!

109
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,926
Good afternoon.

110
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,613
You'll want all day tomorrow, I suppose?

111
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:25,657
Well, if quite convenient, sir.

112
00:14:26,158 --> 00:14:29,328
It's not convenient, and it's not fair.

113
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:32,956
If I were to dock you a half a crown
for it, you'd think yourself ill-used.

114
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:38,504
And yet you don't think me ill-used
when I pay a day's wages for no work.

115
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:41,798
Well, it's only once a year, sir.

116
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:45,552
Poor excuse for picking a man's pocket
every 25th of December.

117
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:51,934
But I suppose you
must have the whole day.

118
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:55,521
Be here all the earlier
the next morning.

119
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:56,647
Sir.

120
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:52,619
In honour of Christmas Eve!

121
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:03,482
Bugger it!

122
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:17,079
Where are you? Here!

123
00:17:18,622 --> 00:17:21,792
Why does everything
seem to happen to me?

124
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:53,574
Get away! Get away!

125
00:18:14,678 --> 00:18:15,762
Balderdash!

126
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:10,085
I have given myself the willies.

127
00:20:12,546 --> 00:20:13,922
That's what it is.

128
00:22:40,527 --> 00:22:41,695
It's all still a hum...

129
00:23:17,856 --> 00:23:18,941
How now!

130
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:21,360
What do you want with me?

131
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:25,155
Oh, much.

132
00:23:27,783 --> 00:23:32,496
- Who are you?
- Ask me who I was.

133
00:23:32,538 --> 00:23:34,164
Who were you then?

134
00:23:34,998 --> 00:23:38,168
In life, I was your partner,

135
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:41,463
Jacob Marley.

136
00:23:46,635 --> 00:23:48,262
Can you sit down?

137
00:23:48,929 --> 00:23:52,349
- I can.
- Do it then.

138
00:24:04,653 --> 00:24:07,406
You do not believe in me.

139
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,368
I don't.

140
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:14,580
Why do you doubt your senses?

141
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:17,457
Because the littlest thing
can affect them.

142
00:24:17,499 --> 00:24:21,003
A slight disorder of the stomach
can make them cheat.

143
00:24:21,086 --> 00:24:24,756
You may be an undigested bit of beef.
A blot of mustard.

144
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:28,468
A crumb of cheese.
A fragment of underdone potato.

145
00:24:28,552 --> 00:24:31,972
There's more of gravy than of grave
about you, whatever you are.

146
00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:39,688
Mercy! Dreadful apparition,
why do you trouble me?

147
00:24:39,771 --> 00:24:44,067
Man of worldly mind,
do you believe in me or not?

148
00:24:44,151 --> 00:24:46,028
I do! I must!

149
00:24:46,111 --> 00:24:50,741
Woe! Woe is me!

150
00:24:50,782 --> 00:24:53,619
You are fettered in chains. Why?

151
00:24:54,036 --> 00:24:57,789
I wear the chain I forged in life.

152
00:24:57,873 --> 00:25:03,003
I made it link by link and yard by yard.

153
00:25:03,045 --> 00:25:06,048
Do you recognise its pattern?

154
00:25:07,341 --> 00:25:11,803
Can you imagine the weight and length
of the chain you bear?

155
00:25:11,845 --> 00:25:15,974
It was as heavy and long
as this seven Christmas Eves ago.

156
00:25:16,016 --> 00:25:20,562
Oh, yours is a ponderous chain.

157
00:25:22,314 --> 00:25:25,734
Jacob, tell me no more.

158
00:25:25,817 --> 00:25:27,945
Speak comfort to me, Jacob.

159
00:25:31,615 --> 00:25:34,493
I have none to give.

160
00:25:36,745 --> 00:25:38,956
I cannot stay.

161
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,583
I cannot linger anywhere.

162
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:46,755
Mark me, in life, my spirit never walked
beyond our countinghouse,

163
00:25:46,797 --> 00:25:52,177
never roved beyond the narrow limits
of our money-changing hole.

164
00:25:52,219 --> 00:25:56,306
Now endless journeys lie before me.

165
00:25:57,641 --> 00:26:01,770
Seven years dead
and travelling all the time?

166
00:26:02,729 --> 00:26:06,817
The whole time. No rest, no peace.

167
00:26:08,735 --> 00:26:11,196
You must've covered
a lot of ground in seven years.

168
00:26:15,409 --> 00:26:21,165
I was blind!
Blind! I could not see my own life!

169
00:26:21,248 --> 00:26:26,920
Squandered and misused.
Oh, woe... Oh, woe is me!

170
00:26:27,004 --> 00:26:29,715
But you were always
a good man of business!

171
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:31,884
Business!

172
00:26:43,729 --> 00:26:47,399
Mankind... was my business.

173
00:26:47,441 --> 00:26:50,527
The common welfare was my business.

174
00:26:51,445 --> 00:26:55,949
Charity, mercy, forbearance,
and benevolence were all my...

175
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,221
Hear me! My time is nearly gone.

176
00:27:17,304 --> 00:27:20,974
I will. But don't be hard upon me,
Jacob. Pray.

177
00:27:21,016 --> 00:27:23,143
I am here to warn you

178
00:27:23,227 --> 00:27:26,980
that you have yet a chance
at a hope of escaping my fate.

179
00:27:27,022 --> 00:27:30,859
A chance of my procuring, Ebenezer.

180
00:27:32,986 --> 00:27:37,241
You were always a good friend
to me, Jacob. Thank 'ee.

181
00:27:37,282 --> 00:27:40,702
You will be haunted by three spirits.

182
00:27:43,705 --> 00:27:45,332
That's the chance and hope?

183
00:27:47,084 --> 00:27:49,795
- I'd rather not.
- Expect the first

184
00:27:49,837 --> 00:27:52,130
tomorrow when the bell tolls one.

185
00:27:53,173 --> 00:27:56,343
Couldn't I take them all at once,
and have it over with, Jacob?

186
00:27:57,511 --> 00:28:01,014
Expect the second the next night
at the same hour.

187
00:28:02,182 --> 00:28:05,769
And the third upon the next night,

188
00:28:05,853 --> 00:28:08,856
when the last stroke of 12

189
00:28:09,523 --> 00:28:12,276
has ceased to vibrate.

190
00:28:19,867 --> 00:28:23,912
Look to see me no more.

191
00:28:55,944 --> 00:28:58,238
I'm sorry.

192
00:28:59,323 --> 00:29:01,783
I wish I could help you.

193
00:30:17,651 --> 00:30:22,281
Are you the spirit whose coming
was foretold to me?

194
00:30:23,657 --> 00:30:25,951
I am.

195
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:41,800
Is it possible that
you might put your cap on?

196
00:30:44,178 --> 00:30:49,683
Would you so soon put out,
with your worldly hands,

197
00:30:49,725 --> 00:30:53,896
the light I give?

198
00:30:53,937 --> 00:30:55,981
No, no! No, no! I'm so sorry.

199
00:30:56,023 --> 00:30:58,984
I meant nothing by it.
I meant no offence.

200
00:30:59,026 --> 00:31:01,236
I just thought I...

201
00:31:16,793 --> 00:31:20,047
Who and what are you?

202
00:31:22,758 --> 00:31:27,221
I am the Ghost of Christmas Past.

203
00:31:31,308 --> 00:31:32,768
Long past?

204
00:31:33,352 --> 00:31:36,271
Your past.

205
00:31:37,898 --> 00:31:40,359
Rise.

206
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:44,780
And walk with me.

207
00:32:02,172 --> 00:32:04,716
But I am mortal and liable to fall.

208
00:32:05,384 --> 00:32:08,720
Bear but a touch of my hand there...

209
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:14,810
...and you shall be upheld
in more than this.

210
00:33:01,857 --> 00:33:03,233
Good heavens.

211
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:06,236
I was bred in this place.

212
00:33:07,821 --> 00:33:09,698
I was a boy here.

213
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:13,994
Your lip... is trembling.

214
00:33:16,038 --> 00:33:18,248
And what's that?

215
00:33:21,043 --> 00:33:24,296
- On your cheek?
- Nothing.

216
00:33:25,214 --> 00:33:27,007
Something in my eye.

217
00:33:31,011 --> 00:33:33,472
Do you remember the way?

218
00:33:34,515 --> 00:33:36,558
Remember it?

219
00:33:37,434 --> 00:33:39,811
I could walk it blindfolded.

220
00:33:42,022 --> 00:33:44,399
Giddyup! Giddyup!

221
00:33:49,571 --> 00:33:54,201
These are but shadows of things
that have been.

222
00:33:55,035 --> 00:34:00,499
They have no consciousness... of us.

223
00:34:05,921 --> 00:34:08,590
I knew them.

224
00:34:08,632 --> 00:34:11,343
I know every one of them.

225
00:34:11,385 --> 00:34:13,762
They were schoolmates of mine.

226
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:18,183
Let's go on.

227
00:34:32,906 --> 00:34:35,534
This...

228
00:34:35,576 --> 00:34:37,619
This was my school.

229
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:41,373
This school is not quite deserted.

230
00:34:42,791 --> 00:34:44,751
A solitary child...

231
00:34:45,377 --> 00:34:48,172
...neglected by his friends...

232
00:34:48,672 --> 00:34:52,426
...is left here still.

233
00:34:53,093 --> 00:34:54,887
I know.

234
00:35:36,803 --> 00:35:38,055
Poor boy.

235
00:35:38,722 --> 00:35:40,766
Poor, poor boy.

236
00:35:42,142 --> 00:35:47,856
Let's... see another Christmas.

237
00:36:12,381 --> 00:36:15,467
Ebenezer!

238
00:36:15,551 --> 00:36:16,802
Ebenezer!

239
00:36:16,844 --> 00:36:22,224
Dear, dear brother!
I've come to bring you home!

240
00:36:22,266 --> 00:36:25,519
- Home, little Fan?
- Yes, home!

241
00:36:25,853 --> 00:36:29,189
Father is so much kinder
than he used to be.

242
00:36:29,273 --> 00:36:31,984
He spoke so gently to me one night.

243
00:36:32,025 --> 00:36:34,987
I was not afraid to ask him
if you might come home.

244
00:36:35,028 --> 00:36:36,989
And he said yes!

245
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:39,700
And he sent me in a coach to fetch you.

246
00:36:39,741 --> 00:36:42,286
And we're to be together
all the Christmas long.

247
00:36:42,327 --> 00:36:46,081
And to have the merriest time
in all the world!

248
00:36:47,457 --> 00:36:50,210
You're quite a woman, little Fan.

249
00:36:55,215 --> 00:36:59,761
- She had a large heart.
- She died a woman.

250
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:03,390
And had, as I think...

251
00:37:04,725 --> 00:37:06,268
...children.

252
00:37:07,227 --> 00:37:09,771
Yes, one child.

253
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:11,481
True.

254
00:37:12,357 --> 00:37:14,902
- Your nephew.
- Yes.

255
00:37:36,215 --> 00:37:38,926
Do you know this place?

256
00:37:39,927 --> 00:37:43,972
Know it? I was an apprentice here!

257
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:51,021
Why, it's old Fezziwig.

258
00:37:51,063 --> 00:37:55,067
Bless his heart!
It's Fezziwig alive again!

259
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:00,739
Yo-ho! Ebenezer, come on!

260
00:38:03,116 --> 00:38:06,286
Come on! Dick! Come on!
It's 6:00.

261
00:38:06,328 --> 00:38:08,455
They're going to be here soon.

262
00:38:09,706 --> 00:38:14,586
Dick Wilkins. Bless me, yes.
There he is, Dick Wilkins.

263
00:38:14,628 --> 00:38:16,839
He was very attached to me, was Dick.

264
00:38:21,134 --> 00:38:25,347
Yo-ho, me lads! No more work tonight.
It's Christmas Eve!

265
00:38:25,389 --> 00:38:26,640
Hooray!

266
00:38:26,723 --> 00:38:28,767
Dick, Ebenezer,
let's get cleared away.

267
00:38:28,809 --> 00:38:32,145
We want lots of space.
Lots and lots of space.

268
00:38:32,187 --> 00:38:33,981
Hee-hi!

269
00:38:44,408 --> 00:38:45,784
Maestro!

270
00:38:46,451 --> 00:38:48,328
May I present...?!

271
00:39:25,449 --> 00:39:28,869
Well done! Well done!

272
00:39:30,204 --> 00:39:34,458
And now, kind fiddler, if you please.

273
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:38,086
It is time for Sir Roger de Coverley!

274
00:39:55,771 --> 00:39:58,315
Might I have this dance with you?

275
00:40:01,568 --> 00:40:03,695
Ebenezer, it's your pass.

276
00:41:15,184 --> 00:41:21,190
- Another idol has replaced me.
- Another idol? What idol?

277
00:41:22,608 --> 00:41:24,193
A golden one.

278
00:41:25,777 --> 00:41:29,448
There is nothing on this earth
more terrifying to me

279
00:41:29,573 --> 00:41:32,826
than a life doomed to poverty.

280
00:41:32,868 --> 00:41:35,746
May I ask, why do you condemn,
with such severity,

281
00:41:35,787 --> 00:41:38,832
the honest pursuit of substance?

282
00:41:40,042 --> 00:41:42,961
You fear the world too much, Ebenezer.

283
00:41:44,838 --> 00:41:47,299
- You've changed.
- Changed?

284
00:41:47,341 --> 00:41:51,470
Perhaps grown wiser,
but I have not changed toward you.

285
00:41:51,512 --> 00:41:53,472
Our contract is an old one.

286
00:41:53,514 --> 00:41:57,434
It was made when we were
both poor and content to be so.

287
00:41:58,435 --> 00:42:00,479
When it was made...

288
00:42:02,105 --> 00:42:06,193
- You were another man.
- I was a boy!

289
00:42:11,865 --> 00:42:13,909
I release you, Ebenezer.

290
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:19,331
Have I ever sought release?

291
00:42:19,373 --> 00:42:22,876
- In words, no.
- In what, then?

292
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:25,921
In an altered spirit.

293
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,091
In another atmosphere of life.

294
00:42:30,384 --> 00:42:34,596
In everything that made my love
of any worth in your sight.

295
00:42:36,139 --> 00:42:40,269
Tell me, Ebenezer, if this contract
had never been between us,

296
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:42,187
would you seek me out now?

297
00:42:45,023 --> 00:42:46,400
No.

298
00:42:49,153 --> 00:42:51,029
You think not?

299
00:42:52,156 --> 00:42:55,242
I would gladly think otherwise
if I could.

300
00:42:57,202 --> 00:43:01,748
But if you were free today,
would you choose a dowerless girl?

301
00:43:02,457 --> 00:43:05,460
A girl left penniless
by the death of her parents?

302
00:43:06,628 --> 00:43:09,173
You, who weighs everything by gain?

303
00:43:13,635 --> 00:43:15,929
I release you, Ebenezer.

304
00:43:17,306 --> 00:43:20,309
May you be happy in the life
you've chosen.

305
00:43:26,315 --> 00:43:29,651
Spirit, remove me from this place.

306
00:43:29,693 --> 00:43:32,946
I told you, these were shadows
of things that have been.

307
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:36,950
They are what they are.
Do not blame me.

308
00:43:36,992 --> 00:43:39,703
Remove me. I cannot bear it.

309
00:43:52,466 --> 00:43:55,719
Leave me! Take me back!

310
00:43:56,637 --> 00:43:58,514
Haunt me no longer!

311
00:44:57,156 --> 00:44:59,533
Oh, blast!

312
00:45:31,732 --> 00:45:33,942
Enter, Scrooge!

313
00:46:09,937 --> 00:46:14,650
Come in! Come in
and know me better, man!

314
00:46:20,823 --> 00:46:24,576
I am the Ghost of Christmas Present.

315
00:46:26,453 --> 00:46:29,289
Look upon me!

316
00:46:37,422 --> 00:46:41,176
You have never seen
the likes of me before?

317
00:46:44,972 --> 00:46:46,139
Never.

318
00:46:46,181 --> 00:46:50,352
Have never walked forth
with my elder brothers?

319
00:46:51,979 --> 00:46:54,106
I don't think that I have.

320
00:46:55,107 --> 00:46:58,277
You have many brothers?

321
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,787
More than 1,800.

322
00:47:09,079 --> 00:47:14,126
1,842, to be exact.

323
00:47:21,008 --> 00:47:25,053
I see you wear a scabbard,
but no sword.

324
00:47:28,265 --> 00:47:29,850
Indeed.

325
00:47:31,643 --> 00:47:36,190
Peace on Earth. Goodwill toward men.

326
00:47:40,027 --> 00:47:44,114
Spirit, conduct me where you will.

327
00:47:58,629 --> 00:48:00,672
Touch my robe.

328
00:48:53,267 --> 00:48:56,353
What's happening? What are you doing?

329
00:49:26,925 --> 00:49:30,596
- Very strange.
- Indeed.

330
00:49:31,221 --> 00:49:36,351
Not many mortals are granted
a heavenly perspective of man's world.

331
00:49:36,435 --> 00:49:37,936
Yes.

332
00:50:25,692 --> 00:50:27,528
It's quite beautiful.

333
00:50:53,470 --> 00:50:57,140
Spirit, these poor people
have no means to cook their food.

334
00:50:57,182 --> 00:50:58,976
And yet you seek
to close the only places

335
00:50:59,059 --> 00:51:02,062
in which they can warm
their meagre meals every seventh day.

336
00:51:09,736 --> 00:51:12,281
Hear me, Scrooge.

337
00:51:14,908 --> 00:51:18,162
There are some upon this earth of yours

338
00:51:18,203 --> 00:51:21,248
who claim to know me and my brothers,

339
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:25,919
and do their deeds of ill will
and selfishness in our name.

340
00:51:26,003 --> 00:51:29,423
These so-called "men of the cloth"

341
00:51:29,506 --> 00:51:34,887
are as strange to me and my kin
as if they never lived.

342
00:51:34,928 --> 00:51:38,599
Charge their doings to them, not us.

343
00:51:40,142 --> 00:51:42,978
Aye. I will.

344
00:51:47,399 --> 00:51:48,775
Smell that?

345
00:51:49,902 --> 00:51:51,487
Cooking goose!

346
00:51:52,321 --> 00:51:53,697
Come on!

347
00:52:16,178 --> 00:52:20,349
I take it this bleak paupers' dwelling
is of some significance.

348
00:52:20,390 --> 00:52:25,813
It is all your loyal clerk can afford
for his meagre 15 bob a week.

349
00:52:25,854 --> 00:52:27,564
- Mother!
- Papa!

350
00:52:27,606 --> 00:52:29,316
We just came by the baker shop.

351
00:52:29,399 --> 00:52:31,944
And smelled our goose,
cooking delicious.

352
00:52:31,985 --> 00:52:35,739
Shut the door, please. What happened
to your precious father?

353
00:52:35,823 --> 00:52:40,285
And your brother. And Martha,
she wasn't as late last Christmas Day.

354
00:52:40,327 --> 00:52:42,454
Mother, here she is, Mother.
Here's Martha.

355
00:52:42,496 --> 00:52:46,083
Martha! Wait till you see
our goose. 'Tis a wonderful one.

356
00:52:46,166 --> 00:52:48,460
Peter, off with you to the baker's
and collect the bird.

357
00:52:48,544 --> 00:52:52,214
And take the children with you.
And pray, no dallying.

358
00:52:52,256 --> 00:52:55,759
Why, bless your heart alive!
Dear, how late you are!

359
00:52:55,843 --> 00:52:59,847
We had a deal of work to finish up last
night and clear away this morning.

360
00:52:59,888 --> 00:53:03,642
Never mind. Long as you're here. Sit ye
down before the fire and have a warm.

361
00:53:03,684 --> 00:53:06,145
No. No, no, no. There's Father coming.

362
00:53:06,186 --> 00:53:09,356
Hide, Martha.
You must hide. Hide, Martha.

363
00:53:18,031 --> 00:53:22,828
- It's cold out there.
- Hello, Father. Hello, Timmy.

364
00:53:27,791 --> 00:53:29,543
Why, where's our Martha?

365
00:53:30,752 --> 00:53:32,462
Not coming.

366
00:53:33,463 --> 00:53:37,718
Not coming?
Not coming upon Christmas Day?

367
00:53:39,219 --> 00:53:40,596
Here I am, Father!

368
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,473
We got you, Father.

369
00:53:43,515 --> 00:53:47,519
I couldn't bear to see you in a state
of disappointment. If only for a giggle.

370
00:53:47,561 --> 00:53:50,314
It's so lovely to see you, my Martha.

371
00:53:50,355 --> 00:53:53,066
Come on, Timmy. I hear
the pudding singing in the copper.

372
00:53:53,108 --> 00:53:54,818
Shall we have a look, then?

373
00:53:55,736 --> 00:54:00,782
- How did little Timmy behave?
- As good as gold. And better.

374
00:54:01,742 --> 00:54:04,453
Somehow he gets thoughtful
sitting by himself so much,

375
00:54:04,495 --> 00:54:07,331
and he thinks the strangest things
you ever heard.

376
00:54:07,372 --> 00:54:10,792
He told me, coming home, that he hoped
the people sawed him in church,

377
00:54:10,918 --> 00:54:12,544
because he was a cripple...

378
00:54:13,879 --> 00:54:17,883
...and it might make pleasant for them
to remember it upon Christmas Day

379
00:54:17,925 --> 00:54:20,636
who made lame beggars walk
and blind men see.

380
00:54:24,556 --> 00:54:29,770
I believe he grows more hearty
and stronger every day, my dear.

381
00:54:38,237 --> 00:54:40,197
The pudding looks delicious!

382
00:54:40,906 --> 00:54:44,243
The whole wash house
smells like a pastry cook's shop.

383
00:54:46,203 --> 00:54:51,333
Spirit, tell me, will Tiny Tim...?

384
00:54:51,375 --> 00:54:56,880
I see a vacant seat
in the poor chimney corner...

385
00:54:58,924 --> 00:55:01,593
...and a crutch without an owner.

386
00:55:05,681 --> 00:55:07,474
Carefully preserved.

387
00:55:10,394 --> 00:55:13,397
- Hurrah!
- The Christmas goose!

388
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:17,151
Make space. Let's get that cover off.

389
00:55:17,818 --> 00:55:20,195
Lovely! Well done, Peter.

390
00:55:20,237 --> 00:55:23,407
I don't believe I've ever seen
a more magnificent goose cooked.

391
00:55:23,448 --> 00:55:25,909
It is a beautiful bird, that's for sure.

392
00:55:26,702 --> 00:55:30,289
But I'll pray that
one Christmas, perhaps,

393
00:55:30,372 --> 00:55:32,249
the children might taste a turkey.

394
00:55:32,291 --> 00:55:35,043
Perhaps one day, my dear.
Perhaps one day.

395
00:55:36,503 --> 00:55:37,880
A toast.

396
00:55:41,383 --> 00:55:42,801
To Mr Scrooge.

397
00:55:43,969 --> 00:55:45,929
The founder of our feast.

398
00:55:47,139 --> 00:55:50,642
Founder of the feast, indeed.
I wish I had him here.

399
00:55:50,726 --> 00:55:52,686
I'd give him a piece of
my mind to feast upon,

400
00:55:52,769 --> 00:55:55,063
and I'd hope he'd have
a good appetite for it.

401
00:55:55,147 --> 00:55:58,817
My dear, the children...
It's Christmas Day.

402
00:55:58,901 --> 00:56:00,944
Christmas Day, I'm sure.
How can one drink the health

403
00:56:01,028 --> 00:56:05,407
of such an odious, stingy, hard,
unfeeling man as Mr Scrooge?

404
00:56:05,449 --> 00:56:09,620
As you know he is, Robert.
Nobody knows it better than you.

405
00:56:09,661 --> 00:56:12,331
My dear, Christmas Day.

406
00:56:13,707 --> 00:56:16,960
I'll drink his health for your sake
and the day's, not for his.

407
00:56:19,421 --> 00:56:21,632
A merry Christmas and a happy New Year.

408
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:25,260
He'll be very merry and very happy,
I have no doubt.

409
00:56:26,386 --> 00:56:31,016
A merry Christmas to us all,
my dears. God bless us.

410
00:56:31,058 --> 00:56:32,935
God bless us.

411
00:56:32,976 --> 00:56:35,979
God bless us, everyone.

412
00:56:37,064 --> 00:56:39,525
- Merry Christmas and happy New Year.
- God bless.

413
00:56:41,151 --> 00:56:45,155
Kind spirit,
say Tiny Tim will be spared.

414
00:56:45,197 --> 00:56:49,034
If these shadows
remain unaltered by the future...

415
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:55,415
...the child will die.
- Die! No, spirit. No.

416
00:56:57,793 --> 00:57:02,256
What then? If he is to die,
he had better do it.

417
00:57:04,341 --> 00:57:06,635
And decrease the surplus population.

418
00:57:29,616 --> 00:57:31,743
- So you're thinking of an animal?
- Yes.

419
00:57:31,785 --> 00:57:33,745
- A live animal?
- Yes.

420
00:57:33,787 --> 00:57:36,165
- A rather disagreeable animal?
- Yes.

421
00:57:36,248 --> 00:57:37,583
- A savage animal?
- Yes.

422
00:57:37,624 --> 00:57:40,586
Wait, wait! Is it an animal
that grunts and growls?

423
00:57:40,627 --> 00:57:41,879
Yes!

424
00:57:41,962 --> 00:57:43,755
- And lives in London?
- Yes.

425
00:57:43,797 --> 00:57:44,882
- A horse?
- No.

426
00:57:44,923 --> 00:57:46,008
- A cow?
- No.

427
00:57:46,049 --> 00:57:47,467
- A dog?
- A pig?

428
00:57:47,509 --> 00:57:49,094
- No.
- An ass?

429
00:57:50,345 --> 00:57:51,847
Yes and no.

430
00:57:52,890 --> 00:57:56,560
I know who it is, Fred!
I know! It's your Uncle Scrooge!

431
00:57:56,602 --> 00:57:58,103
Yes!

432
00:58:06,570 --> 00:58:09,740
Christmas a humbug?
Now, he actually said that?

433
00:58:09,823 --> 00:58:13,076
As I live. And he believes it.

434
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:15,370
I have no patience with him, Fred.

435
00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:18,207
I have. I'm sorry for him.

436
00:58:18,999 --> 00:58:21,919
Who suffers from his ill whims?
Only himself.

437
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:25,547
He decides to dislike us,
won't come and dine with us,

438
00:58:25,589 --> 00:58:28,050
and what's the consequence?
He loses a dinner.

439
00:58:28,133 --> 00:58:32,346
- Indeed, he loses a very good dinner.
- Hear, hear. A magnificent dinner.

440
00:58:32,387 --> 00:58:33,972
Great.

441
00:58:34,473 --> 00:58:37,142
He's certainly given us plenty
of merriment, that's for sure,

442
00:58:37,184 --> 00:58:40,020
and I think it would be ungrateful
not to drink to his health.

443
00:58:40,062 --> 00:58:43,106
He wouldn't take it from me,
but he may have it nevertheless.

444
00:58:43,732 --> 00:58:47,069
A merry Christmas to the old man,
whatever he is. Uncle Scrooge.

445
00:58:47,110 --> 00:58:49,071
To Uncle Scrooge.

446
00:59:03,085 --> 00:59:05,838
Are spirits' lives so short?

447
00:59:05,879 --> 00:59:10,384
My life upon this globe is very brief.

448
00:59:12,219 --> 00:59:14,179
It ends tonight.

449
00:59:14,221 --> 00:59:18,767
- Tonight?
- Tonight at midnight.

450
00:59:20,769 --> 00:59:26,150
Hark. The time is drawing near.

451
00:59:35,284 --> 00:59:36,660
Forgive me...

452
00:59:37,494 --> 00:59:40,497
...but I see something strange
protruding from your skirt.

453
00:59:41,206 --> 00:59:43,333
Is it a foot or a claw?

454
00:59:44,042 --> 00:59:49,089
It might be a claw, for the scant amount
of flesh there is upon it.

455
00:59:51,884 --> 00:59:55,929
- Look here.
- Naff off!

456
00:59:55,971 --> 01:00:00,350
- Oh, man. Look here.
- You daft old geezer.

457
01:00:00,434 --> 01:00:04,104
Look! Look!

458
01:00:04,730 --> 01:00:06,523
Down here!

459
01:00:10,194 --> 01:00:13,614
- Go away!
- Are they yours?

460
01:00:14,072 --> 01:00:16,116
They are man's.

461
01:00:17,284 --> 01:00:19,661
This boy is Ignorance.

462
01:00:20,454 --> 01:00:22,664
This girl is Want.

463
01:00:23,499 --> 01:00:26,502
Beware them both.

464
01:00:46,772 --> 01:00:49,441
Have they no refuge? No resource?

465
01:00:50,776 --> 01:00:52,569
Are there no prisons?

466
01:00:57,407 --> 01:01:00,327
Are there no workhouses?

467
01:02:09,271 --> 01:02:13,108
Am I in the presence of
the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come?

468
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:17,571
You're about to show me shadows

469
01:02:17,654 --> 01:02:20,032
of the things that have not happened
but will happen.

470
01:02:20,073 --> 01:02:21,658
Is that so, spirit?

471
01:02:23,785 --> 01:02:27,623
Ghost of the Future, I fear you
more than any spectre I have seen.

472
01:02:27,664 --> 01:02:30,292
But I know your purpose
is to do me good.

473
01:02:31,084 --> 01:02:33,921
I am prepared to bear you company.

474
01:02:33,962 --> 01:02:35,047
Lead on.

475
01:02:41,261 --> 01:02:44,014
The night is waning fast.
It's precious time to me.

476
01:02:44,056 --> 01:02:45,140
Lead on, spirit.

477
01:02:58,654 --> 01:03:01,782
- When did he die?
- Last night, I believe.

478
01:03:01,824 --> 01:03:04,827
- Or sometime Christmas Day.
- I thought he'd never die.

479
01:03:05,494 --> 01:03:07,120
What's he done with his money?

480
01:03:07,204 --> 01:03:10,791
Hasn't left it to me. That's all I know.

481
01:03:12,376 --> 01:03:15,337
It is likely to be a cheap funeral.

482
01:03:15,379 --> 01:03:18,382
For the life of me, I can't think
of anyone who'd want to attend it.

483
01:03:18,465 --> 01:03:22,928
I don't mind going...
if lunch is provided.

484
01:03:22,970 --> 01:03:24,346
There, yes.

485
01:03:25,514 --> 01:03:26,849
What a frightful fellow.

486
01:03:26,890 --> 01:03:29,351
- All right.
- Good day, gentlemen.

487
01:03:34,898 --> 01:03:40,112
Get ahold of yourself, Ebenezer.
You're having a wobbly.

488
01:06:30,824 --> 01:06:32,493
You won't get me in here.

489
01:06:38,123 --> 01:06:39,917
Christmas pudding, no doubt.

490
01:07:01,688 --> 01:07:03,899
I'm... I'm on Lime Street.

491
01:07:10,906 --> 01:07:12,324
Come now.

492
01:08:43,248 --> 01:08:45,042
Merry Christmas, Joe.

493
01:08:45,125 --> 01:08:47,920
And happy New Year,
to be sure. Come in.

494
01:08:49,671 --> 01:08:52,841
Sit down in me parlour
and let's have a look.

495
01:08:58,722 --> 01:08:59,973
Here.

496
01:09:03,101 --> 01:09:05,229
What do you call these,
Mrs Dilber, huh?

497
01:09:05,270 --> 01:09:06,980
Mrs Dilber?

498
01:09:08,565 --> 01:09:10,317
Bed curtains.

499
01:09:12,069 --> 01:09:15,155
You mean to say you took them down
while he was lying there?

500
01:09:15,989 --> 01:09:17,324
I do.

501
01:09:17,991 --> 01:09:19,451
And why not?

502
01:09:21,995 --> 01:09:25,666
You was born to make your fortune,
and you certainly will do it.

503
01:09:25,707 --> 01:09:29,545
Well, I shan't hold back my hand
when I can get something by it...

504
01:09:29,628 --> 01:09:32,089
Don't you go getting grease
on them blankets now.

505
01:09:32,256 --> 01:09:36,176
- His blankets?
- Whose else do you think?

506
01:09:36,885 --> 01:09:40,889
He won't be feeling the cold
without them now, I dare say.

507
01:09:40,931 --> 01:09:43,308
I hope he didn't die
of anything catching.

508
01:09:43,350 --> 01:09:45,477
Don't you be afeard of that.

509
01:09:46,103 --> 01:09:50,023
I ain't so fond of his company
that I'd loiter about.

510
01:09:54,319 --> 01:09:57,906
You can look through that shirt
till your eyes ache,

511
01:09:57,948 --> 01:10:00,325
and you won't find one hole in it.

512
01:10:01,869 --> 01:10:03,996
- It was the best he had.
- Mrs Dilber!

513
01:10:04,746 --> 01:10:06,707
Would have been wasted, only for me.

514
01:10:06,748 --> 01:10:11,295
- You're fired! Fired!
- How did you mean "wasted"?

515
01:10:11,336 --> 01:10:17,176
Somebody was fool enough
to put it on him to be buried in.

516
01:10:17,968 --> 01:10:20,762
But I took it off him.

517
01:10:24,892 --> 01:10:27,019
This is the end of it, you see.

518
01:10:27,895 --> 01:10:31,231
He frightened everyone away
while he was alive.

519
01:10:32,483 --> 01:10:35,569
Only to profit us now that he's dead.

520
01:10:36,403 --> 01:10:41,450
If he'd had somebody to look after him
when he was struck with death,

521
01:10:41,533 --> 01:10:47,039
instead of lying there, all alone,
gasping out his last breath...

522
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:50,083
...well, we wouldn't have
these things to sell now, would we?

523
01:11:16,902 --> 01:11:19,279
Spirit! I see! I see!

524
01:11:20,614 --> 01:11:23,700
The case of this unhappy man
who dies a solitary, lonesome death

525
01:11:23,784 --> 01:11:25,494
might be my own.

526
01:11:25,536 --> 01:11:27,579
My life tends that way now.

527
01:11:45,556 --> 01:11:47,516
Merciful heavens! What's this?

528
01:11:52,479 --> 01:11:55,524
Spirit, this is a fearful place.

529
01:11:56,316 --> 01:12:00,154
When I leave it, I shall not leave
its lesson. Trust me. Let's go!

530
01:12:14,001 --> 01:12:18,046
I understand. And I would, if I could,
but I have not the power.

531
01:12:30,976 --> 01:12:36,190
Spirit, if there is any person who feels
emotion caused by this man's death,

532
01:12:36,315 --> 01:12:38,692
show that person to me, I beg you.

533
01:12:51,330 --> 01:12:55,083
- Are we ruined?
- There is hope yet.

534
01:12:55,834 --> 01:12:58,962
Hope? Only if he relents.

535
01:13:00,130 --> 01:13:01,882
He is past relenting.

536
01:13:04,009 --> 01:13:05,594
He is dead.

537
01:13:06,345 --> 01:13:07,596
Dead?

538
01:13:11,850 --> 01:13:13,894
To whom will our debts be transferred?

539
01:13:13,977 --> 01:13:15,562
I don't know, but by then
we'll have the money.

540
01:13:15,604 --> 01:13:19,775
And even if we don't, it's unlikely any
new creditor will ever be so merciless.

541
01:13:21,485 --> 01:13:24,279
We shall sleep tonight
with light hearts, my dear.

542
01:13:25,197 --> 01:13:27,866
Let me see some tenderness
connected to death,

543
01:13:27,908 --> 01:13:30,369
or this chamber will forever haunt me!

544
01:13:43,757 --> 01:13:44,925
It's late.

545
01:13:46,218 --> 01:13:48,011
Past your father's time.

546
01:13:50,305 --> 01:13:53,642
He's walked slow
these last few evenings.

547
01:13:54,518 --> 01:13:56,145
Oh, he has walked...

548
01:13:57,146 --> 01:14:01,358
...with Tiny Tim on his shoulders...
fast, indeed.

549
01:14:03,819 --> 01:14:05,863
But he was very light...

550
01:14:07,197 --> 01:14:08,740
...to carry, and...

551
01:14:10,659 --> 01:14:12,703
...your father loved him so.

552
01:14:23,463 --> 01:14:26,675
- Father.
- You went today, then?

553
01:14:28,802 --> 01:14:30,179
Yes, my dear.

554
01:14:30,846 --> 01:14:32,431
I wish you could have gone.

555
01:14:33,515 --> 01:14:36,226
Would have done you good
to see how green a place it is.

556
01:14:37,728 --> 01:14:39,104
You'll see it often.

557
01:14:40,272 --> 01:14:46,028
And I promised him I would
walk there every... every Sunday.

558
01:14:47,446 --> 01:14:49,823
My little child!

559
01:14:51,492 --> 01:14:53,452
My little child.

560
01:14:53,619 --> 01:14:58,081
Father, please don't be grieved.
Please, Father.

561
01:14:58,123 --> 01:15:00,918
I'm all right, love.
I'm quite at peace.

562
01:15:02,878 --> 01:15:07,257
I'm sure none of us
will ever forget our poor Tiny Tim.

563
01:15:07,341 --> 01:15:10,093
- Oh, no, Father.
- Never ever.

564
01:15:10,886 --> 01:15:12,054
Thank you.

565
01:15:13,639 --> 01:15:15,057
Thank you, my dears.

566
01:15:41,458 --> 01:15:42,709
Bob.

567
01:16:09,319 --> 01:16:15,159
Spectre... something tells me
our parting moment is at hand.

568
01:16:16,577 --> 01:16:17,828
Tell me...

569
01:16:18,745 --> 01:16:24,084
...who... was that man
we saw lying dead?

570
01:16:57,743 --> 01:16:58,827
Spirit...

571
01:17:01,622 --> 01:17:06,335
...before I draw nearer
to that stone to which you point,

572
01:17:06,418 --> 01:17:08,003
answer me one question!

573
01:17:08,962 --> 01:17:11,507
Are these the shadows
of things that will be

574
01:17:11,548 --> 01:17:13,592
or shadows of things that may be?

575
01:17:14,301 --> 01:17:17,387
Men's courses in life
foreshadow certain ends.

576
01:17:17,471 --> 01:17:21,683
But if these courses are departed from,
these ends will change. Isn't that so?

577
01:17:24,603 --> 01:17:27,606
No. No!

578
01:17:27,648 --> 01:17:30,984
Am I that man who lay upon the bed?

579
01:17:34,196 --> 01:17:37,616
No. Spirit, hear me!

580
01:17:37,658 --> 01:17:40,035
I'm not the man I was!

581
01:17:40,118 --> 01:17:43,705
Why show me this if I'm past all hope?

582
01:17:44,206 --> 01:17:45,290
Spirit!

583
01:17:45,874 --> 01:17:49,044
Spirit, assure me that I may change
these shadows you've shown me!

584
01:17:49,127 --> 01:17:51,338
Change them by an altered life!

585
01:17:54,758 --> 01:17:58,011
No, spirit! No! No, spirit!

586
01:18:06,103 --> 01:18:08,856
Good spirit... help me!

587
01:18:10,023 --> 01:18:12,484
Spirit!

588
01:18:13,652 --> 01:18:15,529
Help me, spirit!

589
01:18:39,344 --> 01:18:41,138
Help, spirit!

590
01:18:52,566 --> 01:18:57,279
Spirit, I will honour Christmas in my
heart and try to keep it all the year.

591
01:18:57,321 --> 01:19:00,824
I will not shut out the lessons
of the past, nor present, nor future.

592
01:19:00,866 --> 01:19:02,993
Oh, please, spirit,

593
01:19:03,076 --> 01:19:07,956
tell me I may sponge away
the writing on that stone!

594
01:20:00,801 --> 01:20:01,885
Still here?

595
01:20:03,846 --> 01:20:05,222
They're still here.

596
01:20:07,141 --> 01:20:08,225
I'm still here.

597
01:20:10,102 --> 01:20:11,270
I'm still here.

598
01:20:13,605 --> 01:20:15,983
I'm still here!

599
01:20:20,112 --> 01:20:21,280
I don't know what to do.

600
01:20:21,363 --> 01:20:25,117
I'm light as a feather,
merry as a schoolboy.

601
01:20:27,786 --> 01:20:29,538
I've heard that laugh before.

602
01:20:37,921 --> 01:20:40,924
- I say, what's today?
- Eh?

603
01:20:41,675 --> 01:20:46,221
- What's today, my fine fellow?
- Today? Why, Christmas Day.

604
01:20:46,847 --> 01:20:50,100
It's Christmas Day?
I haven't missed it.

605
01:20:50,142 --> 01:20:52,102
The spirits have
done it all in one night.

606
01:20:52,186 --> 01:20:55,439
They can do anything they like.
Of course they can. Of course they can.

607
01:20:55,481 --> 01:20:58,734
Hello, my fine fellow. Do you know
the poulterer's on the corner?

608
01:20:58,775 --> 01:21:02,112
- I should hope I did.
- What an intelligent boy.

609
01:21:02,154 --> 01:21:05,324
Do you know whether they've sold
the prize turkey that was hanging there?

610
01:21:05,365 --> 01:21:08,118
Not the little prize turkey,
the big one.

611
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:11,914
- The one as big as me?
- What a delightful child.

612
01:21:13,874 --> 01:21:17,461
- Yes, my buck.
- It's hanging there now.

613
01:21:17,544 --> 01:21:20,339
Is it? Go and buy it, then!

614
01:21:20,380 --> 01:21:23,717
- Walker!
- No, no, I'm in earnest.

615
01:21:23,759 --> 01:21:27,095
Go and buy it, bring it back here,
and I'll give you a shilling.

616
01:21:27,137 --> 01:21:30,057
Come back in less than five minutes,
and I'll give you a half a crown.

617
01:21:31,558 --> 01:21:35,395
I'll send it to Bob Cratchit's.
He shan't know who sent it.

618
01:21:35,479 --> 01:21:37,940
It's twice the size of Tiny Tim.

619
01:21:41,735 --> 01:21:42,903
Mrs Dilber.

620
01:21:44,321 --> 01:21:46,198
Merry Christmas!

621
01:21:48,575 --> 01:21:50,536
Oh, my God!

622
01:21:52,663 --> 01:21:54,873
He's gone mad!

623
01:21:59,962 --> 01:22:01,547
My dear Mrs Dilber,

624
01:22:01,588 --> 01:22:05,092
you're the loveliest creature
I have ever laid eyes upon.

625
01:22:05,175 --> 01:22:07,886
Dance with me, Mrs Dilber.
Dance with me!

626
01:22:07,928 --> 01:22:11,265
You're barmy, Mr Scrooge! Unhand me!

627
01:22:11,974 --> 01:22:15,978
He's completely deranged! Help!

628
01:22:16,478 --> 01:22:17,980
What a charming woman.

629
01:22:18,021 --> 01:22:19,648
Help!

630
01:22:22,401 --> 01:22:24,444
I shall love it as long as I live.

631
01:22:25,070 --> 01:22:26,697
What an honest face it has.

632
01:22:28,699 --> 01:22:30,659
Hello. Here's the bird.

633
01:22:32,661 --> 01:22:34,454
Hello! Whoop!

634
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:37,457
How are you? Merry Christmas.

635
01:22:39,001 --> 01:22:42,838
Why, it's impossible to carry that
to Camden Town. You must have a cab.

636
01:22:45,007 --> 01:22:46,800
Drive on, my good man!

637
01:22:56,852 --> 01:22:58,812
Hilly-ho! Chirrup!

638
01:23:08,071 --> 01:23:10,199
Hip, hip! Chirry-up!

639
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:12,201
Bob's your uncle! Fanny's your aunt!

640
01:23:12,326 --> 01:23:14,036
Here's your aunt's fanny.

641
01:23:17,539 --> 01:23:20,334
Live it up, folks!
You'll be a long time dead!

642
01:23:20,375 --> 01:23:22,669
Don't let the worms have all the fun.

643
01:23:30,385 --> 01:23:31,845
Merry Christmas.

644
01:23:42,981 --> 01:23:45,192
Good morning, sir.
A merry Christmas to you.

645
01:23:45,275 --> 01:23:47,319
- And to you, sir.
- Happy holiday!

646
01:23:47,402 --> 01:23:49,530
And a merry Christmas to you.

647
01:23:50,113 --> 01:23:52,991
- "God bless you, sir."
- Thank you, sir.

648
01:23:53,909 --> 01:23:55,160
Glad tidings.

649
01:23:55,202 --> 01:23:56,912
Sir.

650
01:24:03,836 --> 01:24:07,840
My dear sir, how do you do?
I hope you succeeded yesterday.

651
01:24:07,881 --> 01:24:09,508
A merry Christmas to you, sir.

652
01:24:10,717 --> 01:24:12,261
Mr Scrooge?

653
01:24:13,053 --> 01:24:17,516
Yes. That is my name, and I fear
it may not be pleasant to you.

654
01:24:18,142 --> 01:24:20,269
But allow me to ask your pardon.

655
01:24:21,061 --> 01:24:22,855
And will you have the goodness...

656
01:24:28,861 --> 01:24:30,195
Lord bless me!

657
01:24:30,237 --> 01:24:34,950
- My dear Mr Scrooge, are you serious?
- And not a farthing less.

658
01:24:35,033 --> 01:24:38,203
A great many back payments
are included in it, I assure you.

659
01:24:38,245 --> 01:24:40,622
My dear sir, I don't know
what to say to such...

660
01:24:40,706 --> 01:24:44,543
Do not say anything.
I'm much obliged to you.

661
01:24:44,626 --> 01:24:47,171
Many thanks to you. And bless you.

662
01:25:37,054 --> 01:25:39,515
- Is your master at home?
- Yes, sir.

663
01:25:41,016 --> 01:25:43,393
I'm... his uncle.

664
01:25:54,112 --> 01:25:56,490
Is it an animal that grunts and growls?

665
01:25:56,532 --> 01:25:57,616
Yes.

666
01:25:57,658 --> 01:25:59,076
- And lives in London?
- Yes.

667
01:25:59,117 --> 01:26:00,202
- A horse?
- No.

668
01:26:00,244 --> 01:26:01,328
- A cow?
- No.

669
01:26:01,370 --> 01:26:02,454
A dog.

670
01:26:02,496 --> 01:26:03,580
- A pig.
- No.

671
01:26:03,622 --> 01:26:04,706
An ass.

672
01:26:05,999 --> 01:26:07,543
Yes and no.

673
01:26:08,794 --> 01:26:10,838
- I know what it is, Fred! I know!
- What?

674
01:26:10,879 --> 01:26:11,964
It's your...

675
01:26:14,007 --> 01:26:15,384
Uncle Scrooge?

676
01:26:16,677 --> 01:26:18,220
Well, bless my soul.

677
01:26:21,640 --> 01:26:24,726
I've... come to dinner...

678
01:26:27,229 --> 01:26:28,939
...if you'll have me.

679
01:26:34,111 --> 01:26:36,655
Of course, Uncle! Welcome! Welcome!

680
01:26:36,697 --> 01:26:39,783
Merry Christmas!
Everybody, this is my uncle, Ebenezer.

681
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:48,584
Be good and pass this.

682
01:26:49,376 --> 01:26:52,004
Here you go. Enjoy.

683
01:26:52,504 --> 01:26:55,632
Next year we must have
this dinner at my house.

684
01:26:55,674 --> 01:26:57,134
I insist.

685
01:26:58,093 --> 01:27:01,847
I'll spare no expense. After all,
you can't take it with you, can you?

686
01:27:01,889 --> 01:27:03,515
No, you can't.

687
01:27:34,546 --> 01:27:37,257
A full 16 minutes late.

688
01:27:41,094 --> 01:27:44,681
What do you mean by
coming here at this time of day?

689
01:27:45,265 --> 01:27:48,769
I'm very sorry, sir.
I am a bit behind in my time.

690
01:27:48,852 --> 01:27:50,896
You are, indeed.

691
01:27:52,397 --> 01:27:54,358
Step in here.

692
01:27:57,611 --> 01:27:59,238
Well, it's only once a year, sir.

693
01:27:59,279 --> 01:28:02,783
It shall not be repeated.
I was making rather merry yesterday.

694
01:28:02,908 --> 01:28:05,744
Now, I'll tell you what, Mr Cratchit.

695
01:28:05,786 --> 01:28:09,289
I'm not going to stand
for this sort of thing any longer.

696
01:28:09,331 --> 01:28:10,707
And therefore...

697
01:28:11,917 --> 01:28:14,127
And therefore...

698
01:28:14,211 --> 01:28:17,464
...I am about to raise your salary!

699
01:28:25,305 --> 01:28:26,765
A merry Christmas to you, Bob.

700
01:28:29,351 --> 01:28:33,105
A merrier Christmas, Bob,
my good fellow,

701
01:28:33,147 --> 01:28:35,774
than I've given you in many a year.

702
01:28:35,816 --> 01:28:40,112
I'll raise your salary, and do whatever
I can to help your struggling family.

703
01:28:40,154 --> 01:28:41,613
And we'll discuss your affairs

704
01:28:41,655 --> 01:28:44,741
this very afternoon
over a bowl of Christmas punch.

705
01:28:44,825 --> 01:28:47,578
But first, let's make up the fires.

706
01:28:47,619 --> 01:28:49,204
I want you to go out...

707
01:28:50,372 --> 01:28:52,499
...and buy another scuttle of coal

708
01:28:52,666 --> 01:28:55,210
before you dot another "l",
Bob Cratchit.

709
01:28:56,378 --> 01:28:58,172
Off with you, Bob.

710
01:28:58,213 --> 01:29:00,924
We've wassailing to do.

711
01:29:01,258 --> 01:29:02,718
Hilly-ho, Bob!

712
01:29:02,759 --> 01:29:05,762
Yeah. Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

713
01:29:27,201 --> 01:29:29,661
And Scrooge was better than his word.

714
01:29:29,703 --> 01:29:32,414
He did all that he said he would
and more.

715
01:29:33,248 --> 01:29:38,670
And to our Tiny Tim, who got well,
Scrooge was like a second father.

716
01:29:38,712 --> 01:29:41,715
He became as good a friend,
as good a master

717
01:29:41,799 --> 01:29:44,343
and as good a man
as the good old city ever knew.

718
01:29:45,302 --> 01:29:49,348
And it was always said of him
that he knew how to keep Christmas well.

719
01:29:50,933 --> 01:29:54,686
And so, as Tiny Tim observed...

720
01:29:54,728 --> 01:29:57,439
God bless us, everyone.

721
01:29:58,439 --> 01:30:08,439
