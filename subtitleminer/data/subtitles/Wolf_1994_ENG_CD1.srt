00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:56,060
- What time did you get back?
- You don' t want to know.

2
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:59,820
Was it worth it?
Did he sign the contract?

3
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:04,060
- Yes.
- What a genius. How did you do it?

4
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:09,340
I did it the old-fashioned way.
I begged.

5
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:43,620
Good morning, Roy and Mary.
What time' s my doctor' s appointment?

6
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,100
I had no idea you had one.

7
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:50,780
- Coffee, Roy?
- Yeah. Are you sick?

8
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:55,780
- A wolf bit me.
- I just asked.

9
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:02,660
- Are you going to Alden' s party?
- Probably.

10
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:08,300
He invites everybody over to let
them know if they still have a job.

11
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:14,220
You have no appointment.
But he' ll see you before 12.

12
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:18,820
If you get the axe tonight,
I go with you.

13
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:23,900
- So do I.
- Listen, you need your pay cheques.

14
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:29,220
I forbid you to take any action
if I' m fired.

15
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:33,260
Right. Maude Waggins
is waiting in your office.

16
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:37,540
I cannot write for a conglomerate.
Protect me.

17
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:42,380
Raymond Alden isn' t a conglomerate,
he' s a billionaire.

18
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:48,140
And I' m not sure if I' m going
to be here after the takeover.

19
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:54,780
You' re the senior editor.
Your name, your reputation ...

20
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:59,580
My reputation has been in question
ever since I told Judith Krantz -

21
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:03,420
- that no 14-year-old
would read her fiction.

22
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:06,820
- Bullshit!
- Sit down. Maude.

23
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:13,700
The good news is that the head of
marketing is my friend and protege.

24
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,220
lf I leave. he' ll leave with me.

25
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:21,620
I know they don' t want to lose him.
That may give me some leverage.

26
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:25,700
I' ll leave with you, too!
How' s that for leverage?

27
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,780
Let' s go and see your protege.

28
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:38,020
Willie,
just the man I wanted to see.

29
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,700
Maude Waggins.

30
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:45,540
You saved my life. While reading
"What About Us Girls?" ...

31
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:49,140
- You realised you had to write.
- No, I stopped.

32
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:53,220
I realised that if this was talent.
I had none.

33
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:57,060
- How nice that it should stop you.
- I adore you.

34
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:03,260
- I taught him to do that.
- I used to hit my authors.

35
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:12,260
Maude wants in if we leave. Do you
know what her contract calls for?

36
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:17,020
She' s obligated to one more book.
We get first look at her next two.

37
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:23,100
How about an 80-page reminiscence
of all the restaurants I' ve loved?

38
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,260
There are no specifications
in the contract.

39
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:29,980
I' ll start eating out right now.

40
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:34,900
You are a rarity. A loyal man,
with a great taste in authors.

41
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:41,460
Bye, Will. I' ll see you at Jason' s.

42
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:50,660
You' re such a polished ass-kisser
it takes my breath away.

43
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:54,140
I kiss' em like I see' em.

44
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:58,300
A wolf in Vermont.
I don' t think so. Will.

45
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,820
You weren' t there.

46
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:06,620
You sure it wasn' t a husky?
After all, it was dark out.

47
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:11,140
There was a full moon.
It was a wolf.

48
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:15,300
I was staring straight at it.
You don' t confuse a dog with a wolf.

49
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:21,380
I see. Funny, this isn' t the first
rabies shot I' ve given recently.

50
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:28,100
My wife' s sister-in-law in Oneonta,
a raccoon bit her in the ass.

51
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:32,460
My friend' s son sustained
brain damage from a snake bite.

52
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:37,020
He was by the pool,
next thing he has brain damage.

53
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:43,180
- Is he all right?
- No, you idiot, he' s brain damaged.

54
00:10:54,980 --> 00:11:00,980
I see Time-Warner
as a bunch of decent caring people.

55
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:05,900
Money doesn' t always imply
ruthless ambition. Am I insane?

56
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,060
I would say so, yes.

57
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,060
He' s so charming.

58
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:16,380
Because the rainforest
is being destroyed so rapidly, -

59
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:20,340
- all these viruses
are going to colonise the world.

60
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:26,900
They' ll kill off the population.
I' m only quoting "The New Yorker" .

61
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:32,100
Everyone' s trying to say the world
will end if we have no rainforests.

62
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:39,420
You could make a case that the world
has already ended. That art is dead.

63
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:44,900
Instead of art we have
pop culture and daytime TV.

64
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:50,580
Women who' ve been raped by
their dentists confiding in Oprah.

65
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:56,900
An exploration in depth of why women
cut off their husbands'  penises.

66
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:07,100
- Time to fill up the glass.
- Yes. let' s have a drink.

67
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:14,780
Relax. Eat something.
At least get a meal out of this.

68
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:19,020
I didn' t like the food.
All that red meat dripping blood.

69
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:25,780
- You' re fun to eat with.
- Mr. Alden would like to see you.

70
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:32,660
"Never send to know for whom
the bell tolls. It tolls..."

71
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:37,060
Will... just remember who you are.

72
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:40,900
Charm him. You can be charming
when you want to.

73
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:47,260
- Why is he doing it this way?
- It' s kinder face-to-face.

74
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:57,860
- Cigar?
- Don' t mind if I do.

75
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:09,300
I want you to think about Europe.

76
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:13,460
Eastern Europe, particularly.

77
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:17,180
There' s a whole new market
opening up there.

78
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:23,220
God and currency willing,
the entire continent will cohere.

79
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:28,180
Both economically and culturally.
I want that to be your area.

80
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:31,980
I see...

81
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:41,860
Then my area will no longer be
editor-in-chief after the takeover?

82
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:46,140
There' s nothing personal,
you know that.

83
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:52,540
You' re clearly a man
of taste and individuality.

84
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:59,060
But these days,
all around the globe, -

85
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:03,780
- taste and individuality
are actually a handicap.

86
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:11,220
Then what of my successor?
Is he a vulgar conformist?

87
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:17,540
Drive. Hustle. Drive
and 52-carat ambition.

88
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:22,620
He nagged me day and night
until I gave him your job.

89
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:30,020
Well. for what it' s worth. here' s
what I' ve learned in 30 years:

90
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:35,140
Treat the authors as human beings.
Don' t stint on review copies.

91
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:41,100
Don' t hold them to deadlines.
They' ll only turn in rough drafts.

92
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,700
Thank you, I' ll remember that.

93
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:49,420
You' re a nice person, Will.
Thank God I replaced you.

94
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:53,420
I hope you give
Eastern Europe a shot.

95
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:57,660
You' d better put that out.
Horses don' t like it.

96
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:03,980
- I think I' ll finish it.
- Go ahead. Good cigar, isn' t it?

97
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:18,540
This is the prize. Fort Knox.

98
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:27,620
Drink it.

99
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:38,820
Good boy.

100
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:52,180
I' m afraid I...
finished your drink.

101
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:56,500
What are you?
The last civilised man?

102
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:59,300
I' m...

103
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:03,300
... just embarrassed.

104
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:11,020
Half the people here use Thorazine,
so a little anxiety is okay.

105
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:17,180
- You' re very kind.
- No. I' m not.

106
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:22,020
I' m Laura Alden. Alden is my father.

107
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:29,060
- I' m Will Randall.
- Nice to meet you.

108
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:33,540
- You don' t seem surprised.
- Not tonight.

109
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:39,780
- He just fired you, didn' t he?
- Demoted is the word.

110
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:45,340
I have a choice between no job
and a job no one would want.

111
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:51,620
- What will you do?
- Take the job no one would want.

112
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:56,100
I don' t have the courage
to be jobless at my age.

113
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:59,260
Old guy?

114
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:02,940
Yeah... Old guy.

115
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:11,220
Well... I' d better get back.

116
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:18,820
Was that on purpose?

117
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:25,580
No... You' re perfectly safe.
I' m married.

118
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:31,580
- And that makes you perfectly safe?
- Yes...

119
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:43,820
You better clean yourself up
if you' re gonna face the crowd.

120
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:48,740
Here, wipe your face.
It' s all sweaty.

121
00:18:56,300 --> 00:19:01,820
There you are, dear.
All ready for company.

122
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:05,660
Thank you.

123
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,700
How did it go?

124
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:40,260
Speak, we' ve been going nuts.

125
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:47,300
First, let me say congratulations
on being the new editor-in-chief.

126
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:52,940
What ..? Alden said that?

127
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:56,060
What did he say?

128
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:05,780
He called this evening and told me
he wanted me to take the job.

129
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:11,340
I said that it was your job.
I didn' t know if he was serious.

130
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:17,820
I didn' t ask for this.
Say the word, I' ll turn it down.

131
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:22,300
- What should I do?
- That' s up to you, Stewart.

132
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:26,380
No, it' s up to you.
I' ll do whatever you say.

133
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:30,580
You' re asking the one person
who can' t advise you.

134
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:34,780
Shit! I' m sorry you said that.

135
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:40,460
That son of a bitch! Prick!

136
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:46,100
I had no idea
he was offered your job.

137
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:52,260
Alden must have made a good offer,
but he could have told you.

138
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:58,260
Why didn' t you say something?
You let him walk away guilt-free.

139
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:01,580
Charlotte, please...

140
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:06,340
I can' t talk now.

141
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:11,980
May I just say
one more thing about it?

142
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:15,020
No.

143
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:30,340
Will, come on, it' s 7:30.

144
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:36,780
Give me till eight.

145
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:07,540
Will?

146
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:19,900
It' s 7:40.
I asked you to give me till eight.

147
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:25,020
It' s 7:40 at night, you dope.

148
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,540
You' ve slept all day.

149
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:32,100
Are you all right?
How do you feel?

150
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:40,580
I feel...

151
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:43,900
... good.

152
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:49,220
I said, "Why assign me mastectomies
and oestrogen therapy?"

153
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:53,780
"Let me do genetic engineering.
Give Pete mastectomies."

154
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:58,420
You know what he said? "You' ll do it
so much better, you' re a woman."

155
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:03,300
l said, "That' s like telling
a black food-writer..." Hey!
what are you doing?

156
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:08,860
l have to catch up.

157
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:16,180
l haven' t eaten. l haven' t drunk.
l haven' t made love in a long time.

158
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:20,020
A very long time.

159
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:26,500
Do you think we ought to do it
right here in front of the church?

160
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:39,340
- What else do you do without hands?
- You' ll see.

161
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:43,860
What was in that stew?

162
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:36,260
- Good morning.
- It' s a bit early to be drinking?

163
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:41,820
- How the fuck did you know?
- You can smell it a mile away.

164
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:50,700
- Mr. Randall, are you all right?
- Perfectly.

165
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:56,100
I heard about Alden' s decision.
I' m so sorry.

166
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:03,700
- Was Stewart just in here?
- Not just. About an hour ago.

167
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:08,180
That' s how I found out.
Are you all right?

168
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,700
I' m fine.

169
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:27,700
- I want to say I think it sucks.
- Thank you, Roy.

170
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:35,860
What did you do, get contacts?

171
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:44,900
I' ll be damned...

172
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:52,100
You' ve edited about 60 pages
since Monday. What are you on?

173
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:56,140
Nothing.
I just caught up on my sleep.

174
00:25:56,340 --> 00:26:01,980
I got 20 hours of sleep
and I feel 20 years younger.

175
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:06,620
And so now
you can see without your glasses?

176
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:13,060
Yeah, you' ve got a point.

177
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:13,900
You know what he said?
"How could you drink this early?"

178
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:20,860
I put some tequila in my coffee
and he said he smelled it.

179
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:33,540
- Alden replaced Randall.
- Are you sure?

180
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:39,060
It' s official. Will Randall' s out.
Stewart Swinton' s in.

181
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:08,980
Get me Gary on the phone.

182
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:15,700
- A manual on owning animals?
- No. Animal possession.

183
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:20,380
Demonic possession.
Possession of the spirit by animals.

184
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:23,460
Give me a minute.

185
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:27,980
- How many do you want?
- One, the most respectable.

186
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:37,700
Vijav Alezais
wrote "Something Wild" in 1948.

187
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:42,100
- Old but breathing.
- He' s not some kind of mystic?

188
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:47,580
No, he has letters after his name.
ln fact, he' s Doctor Alezais.

189
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:52,460
Thank you.
Give his number to Mary, please.

190
00:28:52,660 --> 00:29:00,260
And, Gary, don' t tell people
you had tequila with your coffee.

191
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:03,540
You didn' t have coffee
this morning.

192
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:25,020
Hi, I made it to New Haven.
l' ll be home tomorrow.

193
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:28,900
lf you get hungry,
there' s some leftover stew.

194
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:34,380
Let' s see if it still works,
you animal!

195
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:26,460
- Yes?
- It' s Will.

196
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:29,780
l' ll come down.

197
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:50,660
Hey, Will. What' s going on?
What is it?

198
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:55,900
What' s wrong?

199
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:04,700
What did he...

200
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:32,940
I' m sorry.

201
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:42,020
I' ll get dressed.

202
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:15,260
- Good morning, Mr. Randall.
- I' ve moved to the Mayflower.

203
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:18,900
- Is that permanent?
- Yes.

204
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:23,980
Call legal and find out
if the deal with Alden is closed.

205
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:29,460
Get Roy to come over with a list of
every author he' s ever worked with.

206
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:33,260
And a list of every author
I' ve ever worked with.

207
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:37,780
Call Alden and get me
an appointment this afternoon.

208
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:40,540
Is the worm turning?

209
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:47,700
- The worm is now packing an Uzi.
- It' s about fucking time.

210
00:32:55,820 --> 00:33:01,180
Shall I resign today? Promise
never to see Charlotte again?

211
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:05,660
- Just tell me what to do.
- Resign today.

212
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:11,180
I can' t do that.

213
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:19,700
So why did I say it?

214
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:28,740
I guess it' s just a way
of telling you...

215
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:34,740
... how bad I feel
about being such a shit.

216
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:45,180
I love you, Will.
I know how that sounds, but I do.

217
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:50,580
I know how much I' ve hurt you
and it kills me.

218
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:56,700
I know I can' t...

219
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:03,980
- You' ll never forgive me, will you?
- No.

220
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:12,060
I' d still like one thing.

221
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:17,740
Your permisson to call Alden and
tell him to forget Eastern Europe.

222
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:22,300
To keep you on as a consultant.
May I do that for you?

223
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:27,420
I' m gonna get you, Stewart.

224
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:46,700
The deal is not officially closed.
Mr. Alden will see you at 12:30.

225
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:54,660
Roy, ask your list of authors about
forming a publishing partnership.

226
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:57,780
Tell them
we' re leaving MacLeish House, -

227
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:05,180
- whose new policy is to bury
everything that doesn' t sell.

228
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:09,660
- Tell them we' ve got investors.
- Two things.

229
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:13,220
- How many investors do we have?
- I don' t know.

230
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:16,620
But I say it anyway.
Is any of this true?

231
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:19,940
- Not yet.
- You' re my God.

232
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:25,180
You' d better start calling writers.
Begin with Maude.

233
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:39,300
Mr. Randall.

234
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:44,220
I wanted to tell you that
I' m turning down Eastern Europe.

235
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:48,220
I more or less
thought you would.

236
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:52,740
Nice seeing you again, sir.

237
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:48,580
- Are you all right?
- Are you crazy?

238
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:55,620
Stay away from animals when
you know they' re frightened of you!

239
00:36:55,780 --> 00:37:01,940
Didn' t you realise that on Monday?
Your presence disturbs them.

240
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:08,820
- I just wanted to say hello.
- You haven' t fallen in years.

241
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:12,260
Here you still are.
Did you get lost?

242
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:18,220
- No.
- We were talking.

243
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:22,940
Henry and Caroline are here.
I told them you' d join us.

244
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:30,380
Did you? What a pity,
I' m having lunch with... Will.

245
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:36,620
lt doesn' t really matter to Laura
what your name is, Mr. Randall.

246
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:42,540
What is important is that you' re
unemployed and I disapprove of you.

247
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:50,140
- We' re going to miss your company.
- Yes, I know.

248
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:53,980
Shall we start cooking?

249
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,820
Your place?

250
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:19,580
A guest house.
I stay here when I' m in town.

251
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:28,300
I only have peanut butter and jelly.
We' ll have to cancel lunch.

252
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:32,460
Peanut butter and jelly
is mother' s milk to me.

253
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:36,420
Whatever you think
is going to happen, isn' t.

254
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:41,140
Don' t take anything for granted
because we exchanged a few words.

255
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:49,260
I don' t take anything for granted,
except perhaps a little civility.

256
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:09,420
So what do you do?

257
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:13,940
Why do you care?

258
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:18,900
I don' t. I was just making
polite conversation.

259
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:25,740
I' d rather not discuss what I do.

260
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:35,860
I think I understand
what you' re like now.

261
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:41,340
You think men are only interested
in you because you' re beautiful.

262
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:45,460
But you want them
to be interested in you.

263
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:49,900
The problem is
that you' re not very interesting.

264
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:55,220
You' re rude, you' re hostile,
you' re sullen, you' re withdrawn...

265
00:39:55,380 --> 00:40:00,820
I know you want someone to look
past all that to what' s underneath.

266
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:07,100
But the only reason anyone would
bother is because you' re beautiful.

267
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:12,420
Ironic, isn' t it? In an odd way
you are your own problem.

268
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:18,140
Sorry, wrong line.

269
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:24,020
I' m not shocked by your keen insight
and suddenly challenged by you.

270
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:29,980
Shall we have the rest of our milk
in the living room?

271
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:40,820
Are all these you?

272
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:47,580
Yes, my father keeps this cottage
empty just for me, -

273
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:51,980
- so I can stay
as far away from him as possible.

274
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:57,140
The pictures were thrown in by the
decorator. He had a mawkish side.

275
00:40:57,340 --> 00:41:02,460
- Is this you?
- My mother. She died when I was 12.

276
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:06,660
I' m sorry.

277
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:11,420
And this?

278
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:17,540
My brother. He died last year.

279
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:24,780
Yes... I remember.
He had some kind of an accident.

280
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:27,620
No, he killed himself.

281
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:33,300
He was diagnosed
borderline schizophrenic.

282
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:39,420
I guess he got tired of the title.
He lived with me on and off.

283
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:45,900
- Nice face.
- Yeah...

284
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:50,220
He was pretty nice
for a little brother.

285
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:02,060
This is really something.

286
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:05,340
Isn' t it?

287
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:09,820
This is where I used to come
to bury my pets.

288
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:17,020
And this is where I realised
that one day I would die.

289
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:23,980
Standing right here on this spot,
I realised one day I would be over.

290
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:29,100
I want to tell you something.

291
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:33,660
A few days ago,
something happened to me.

292
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:38,780
I was driving in New England
and I hit an animal.

293
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:44,380
- A wolf.
- In New England? Are you sure?

294
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:48,540
I' m positive.
When I tried to touch it, it bit me.

295
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:52,340
- Did you get checked for rabies?
- Yes, I' m fine.

296
00:42:52,540 --> 00:43:00,060
This will really sound insane.
The wolf passed something on to me.

297
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:04,540
A scrap of its spirit in my blood.

298
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:14,380
My senses are suddenly so acute.
I feel just so... great.

299
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:21,420
I' m just not the kind of person
who walks around feeling great.

300
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:26,500
I' m more alive. Stronger.

301
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:33,420
- It sounds strange, but...
- It' s better than living in Bosnia.

302
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:38,140
No, I wasn' t going to say that.
I was going to say that...

303
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:44,940
If you feel great, maybe you
should just accept it as a gift.

304
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:48,620
I' m afraid it will have a price.

305
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:54,780
There is that.

306
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:02,220
Would you like to stay for dinner?

307
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:07,100
If not peanut butter and jelly,
and I won' t tell my father.

308
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:10,940
Yes.

309
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:18,660
- Let' s get back before it' s dark.
- Are you coid?

310
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:22,620
No, but we will be.

311
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:27,900
What is it?

312
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:33,100
- Here, sit down.
- I think... I want to get inside.

313
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:36,580
It' s not that far.
Here, lean on me.

314
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:43,220
Listen, I' m an almost-professional
psychiatric nurse.

315
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:06,660
Elevated, but you' ll live.

316
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:09,740
Is this another attack?

317
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:13,700
I don' t know.

318
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:21,980
Don' t be upset with me
if I tell you this, okay?

319
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:30,220
You are beautiful.

320
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:37,140
And the nicest girl...

321
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:43,180
Can I get you something to eat?

322
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:47,700
- I can' t eat.
- Then go to sleep.

323
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:52,780
The next thing you know it' ll
be morning and I' ll make coffee.

324
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:55,940
- Eggs and toast.
- Bacon.

325
00:45:56,140 --> 00:46:02,900
You think I can' t get bacon?
I just may surprise you.

326
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:07,700
- I don' t know where I' m going.
- Some place nice.

327
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:47,900
- Any idea how this happened?
- None.

328
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:52,780
- Do you ever sleepwalk?
- Not that I know of.

329
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:56,940
It sounds like you took a walk
in your sleep and fell down.

330
00:51:57,140 --> 00:52:02,860
There' s some lacerations back here.
Nothing bleeds like the scalp.

331
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:06,660
I' ll have you in
for an EEG and a CAT scan.

332
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:10,020
- You' ll have to be in overnight.
- Impossible.

333
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:13,420
You could have a concussion.

334
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:17,060
No one feels this good
with a concussion.

335
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:35,180
So good to see you again
so soon. sir.

336
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:39,460
It' s nice to see you too, Will.
Robert Keyes, my counsel.

337
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:46,500
- Counsellor, nice to meet you.
- Sit down. Will.

338
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:52,380
You' re deliberately goading
some of our top writers -

339
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:57,260
- to become part of some
totally improbable scheme.

340
00:52:57,460 --> 00:53:02,060
And being writers,
they' re too damn stupid to know it.

341
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:07,940
They might not succeed,
but it won' t hurt them to try.

342
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:15,420
And if they fail, any publisher
will be glad to get them.

343
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:21,060
It doesn' t matter if we start a new
publishing house or go to another.

344
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:26,860
At least seven top writers
are going to leave MacLeish House.

345
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:36,060
My press release in the morning will
see this firm' s reputation collapse.

346
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:41,060
- You' re worse than Stewart.
- Yes.

347
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:47,140
But I have two big drawbacks:
Taste and individuality.

348
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:51,380
Maybe I can overlook them.

349
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:10,580
All right.
Call it off. Keep your job.

350
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:16,140
I' d never have fired you
if I' d known you were this ruthless.

351
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:22,540
I want a deal memo granting me
additional powers and monies.

352
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:25,060
By tomorrow morning.

353
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:30,620
- I won' t agree to that.
- You will. I' d do the same.

354
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:37,740
- I' ll tell Stewart.
- Wait until the deal is signed.

355
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:40,580
Then I' ll tell Stewart.

356
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:51,580
