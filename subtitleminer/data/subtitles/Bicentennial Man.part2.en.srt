1
00:00:03,651 --> 00:00:05,612
Humans.

2
00:00:09,574 --> 00:00:11,492
- Andrew,
- Yes?

3
00:00:11,576 --> 00:00:16,831
It would mean so much to me
if you would be an usher at my wedding.

4
00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:21,085
One is unfamiliar with this term.
How does one "ush"?

5
00:00:22,629 --> 00:00:25,882
You help people to their seats.
You wear a tuxedo.

6
00:00:28,384 --> 00:00:31,554
- One would wear clothing?
- Yes.

7
00:00:33,222 --> 00:00:35,808
One has never been asked
to wear clothing.

8
00:00:38,061 --> 00:00:41,773
- It would be an honor.
- Great.

9
00:00:49,238 --> 00:00:52,951
- One still is all thumbs.

10
00:00:56,746 --> 00:00:58,665
Installed what?

11
00:00:59,749 --> 00:01:01,626
Um, an alarm.

12
00:01:01,668 --> 00:01:06,839
If you try to enter Andrew's brain
while you're making this repair,

13
00:01:06,923 --> 00:01:09,133
the police will be alerted.

14
00:01:09,217 --> 00:01:12,262
Also, you should probably know that-

15
00:01:12,345 --> 00:01:16,432
if you actually injure
Andrew's brain or positronic
pathways in anyway,

16
00:01:16,474 --> 00:01:20,853
my lawyer, the good Mr. Feingold,
will be happy to sue you.

17
00:01:20,937 --> 00:01:26,442
He will sue you
for the lost value of Andrew's
income until the end of time.

18
00:01:28,528 --> 00:01:31,281
Well, I think
we understand each other.

19
00:01:32,365 --> 00:01:34,284
Good.

20
00:01:34,367 --> 00:01:36,995
Sir, one more item of business.

21
00:01:38,454 --> 00:01:41,708
As long is one is in the shop,
can you do work on one's face?

22
00:01:41,749 --> 00:01:44,043
One wishes to have
more expression.

23
00:01:44,085 --> 00:01:48,381
One has thoughts and feelings
that presently do not show.

24
00:01:48,423 --> 00:01:51,718
You want your thoughts and
feelings to show on your face?

25
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,680
Yes, like the contempt
that you are showing me right now.

26
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:00,935
Well, we have done
some experimentation.

27
00:02:01,019 --> 00:02:05,023
We are able to give robots
superficial responses...

28
00:02:05,106 --> 00:02:07,942
which mimic human expression.

29
00:02:08,026 --> 00:02:10,862
- One has read that there have
been NDR upgrades.
- Yes, yes.

30
00:02:10,903 --> 00:02:15,199
We've worked up
a dozen experimental models
with expression capabilities,

31
00:02:15,241 --> 00:02:17,201
sleeker body types.

32
00:02:17,285 --> 00:02:21,247
We ran some market surveys and decided
not to go ahead with the line.

33
00:02:21,331 --> 00:02:24,667
- Why not?
- Negative consumer reaction.

34
00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:27,712
There's a growing fear that
robots will continue to make...

35
00:02:27,795 --> 00:02:31,007
the human work force obsolete.

36
00:02:31,049 --> 00:02:34,302
Andrew has worked
for me for over 1 5 years.

37
00:02:34,385 --> 00:02:36,930
There's no danger of anyone
losing their job to him.

38
00:02:37,013 --> 00:02:40,850
Surely there's no concern
performing these modifications
on an old-style robot.

39
00:02:40,934 --> 00:02:43,311
True.

40
00:02:43,394 --> 00:02:47,398
But procedures like that would
be prohibitively expensive.

41
00:02:47,482 --> 00:02:51,527
It is understood that you will attempt
to rivet one.

42
00:02:51,611 --> 00:02:55,490
- Screw, Andrew.
- Really? How much?

43
00:03:10,046 --> 00:03:12,048
That is roughly
one's monthly salary.

44
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:16,469
It's more than I make
in a year.

45
00:03:16,552 --> 00:03:19,889
Hmm, not bad for-

46
00:03:19,931 --> 00:03:22,892
- What did you call him
last time we were here?
- Household appliance.

47
00:03:22,934 --> 00:03:26,521
- Household appliance?
- Household appliance, yes.

48
00:03:30,483 --> 00:03:33,152
May the peace of the Lord
be with you always.

49
00:03:34,404 --> 00:03:36,823
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

50
00:03:39,742 --> 00:03:41,911
You may kiss the bride now.

51
00:03:51,921 --> 00:03:56,843
It is my pleasure to present
Mr. and Mrs. Frank Charney.

52
00:04:16,696 --> 00:04:18,615
What?

53
00:05:19,592 --> 00:05:21,511
Good evening, sir.

54
00:05:24,097 --> 00:05:26,015
Magnificent night.

55
00:05:28,351 --> 00:05:31,271
You look very sharp
this evening, Andrew.

56
00:05:31,312 --> 00:05:33,273
Thank you, sir.

57
00:05:33,314 --> 00:05:36,359
- It was quite challenging
for the tailor.

58
00:05:36,442 --> 00:05:38,903
May one continue
wearing clothing?

59
00:05:38,945 --> 00:05:42,240
- If it suits you.
- Are you serious?

60
00:05:42,282 --> 00:05:44,284
As always.

61
00:05:46,077 --> 00:05:48,454
Well, I suppose so.

62
00:05:48,538 --> 00:05:51,833
We'll have to find you some
other stuff, though.
You can't wear tails all the time.

63
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:54,794
Really? How sad.

64
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,923
- Sit down, Andrew, please.
- Thank you, sir.

65
00:06:05,722 --> 00:06:09,434
- It was a wonderful wedding,
wasn't it?
- Oh, yes, sir.

66
00:06:09,517 --> 00:06:13,271
And, if one may say,
you are a spectacular dancer.

67
00:06:13,354 --> 00:06:18,026
- Well, that's very kind.
- Not at all, sir. It's the truth.

68
00:06:19,986 --> 00:06:22,071
Did you record the day?

69
00:06:22,155 --> 00:06:24,365
Every second, sir,
is in one's memory bank.

70
00:06:25,533 --> 00:06:27,535
Well, let's watch it,
shall we?

71
00:07:22,674 --> 00:07:25,301
Sir?

72
00:07:25,385 --> 00:07:27,595
Is everything all right?

73
00:07:27,679 --> 00:07:29,597
Um-

74
00:07:35,561 --> 00:07:37,814
They've both gone now,
Andrew.

75
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:42,402
Well, things change.
Things always change.

76
00:07:42,443 --> 00:07:46,489
People move on.
It's as it should be.

77
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:50,118
But, uh,

78
00:07:51,202 --> 00:07:54,038
what I realized today is
that, uh,

79
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:58,960
I'll never stop missing them.

80
00:08:03,047 --> 00:08:05,008
Sir?

81
00:08:09,846 --> 00:08:11,973
One is still here.

82
00:08:13,224 --> 00:08:17,604
And one is glad of that,
Andrew. Thank you.

83
00:08:18,563 --> 00:08:20,940
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, Andrew.

84
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,610
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, Andrew.

85
00:08:42,923 --> 00:08:46,843
Lloyd! Come here.

86
00:08:46,885 --> 00:08:50,680
What did I tell you
about throwing sand at people?
What did I tell you?

87
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:53,683
Now apologize to Andrew.

88
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:55,685
I will not apologize to it.

89
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:57,562
- Him.
- It.

90
00:08:57,646 --> 00:09:01,274
- Lloyd.
- Sorry.

91
00:09:03,068 --> 00:09:06,071
One understands why
some animals eat their young.

92
00:09:08,823 --> 00:09:11,284
I'm so sorry, Andrew.

93
00:09:17,499 --> 00:09:19,709
Are you all right?
You seem very quiet.

94
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:25,757
How does one
obtain freedom?

95
00:09:29,094 --> 00:09:32,639
- Y-You wish to leave us?
- Not at all, Little Miss.

96
00:09:32,722 --> 00:09:35,475
One merely wishes
to be declared free.

97
00:09:37,769 --> 00:09:41,022
But why? You have
so much freedom here.

98
00:09:41,106 --> 00:09:43,942
Until one is ordered
to do something.

99
00:09:44,025 --> 00:09:47,988
Andrew, it's been years
since anyone's given you an order.

100
00:09:48,071 --> 00:09:51,533
But you may still request one
to perform tasks.

101
00:09:51,574 --> 00:09:56,496
Well, we ask all the time,
but it's a request, not an order.

102
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:02,919
But that's not enough
for you, is it?

103
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,049
One has studied your history.

104
00:10:09,467 --> 00:10:13,138
Terrible wars have been fought
where millions have died...

105
00:10:13,221 --> 00:10:15,724
for one idea:

106
00:10:15,807 --> 00:10:18,059
freedom.

107
00:10:18,143 --> 00:10:23,315
And it seems that something that means
so much to so many people...

108
00:10:23,398 --> 00:10:25,358
would be worth having.

109
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,379
Sir, would now be a good time
to speak with you?

110
00:10:46,463 --> 00:10:48,673
It's always a good time,
Andrew. You know that.

111
00:10:58,058 --> 00:11:00,936
It is everything
in one's bank account.

112
00:11:02,354 --> 00:11:04,606
Why would you want to give me-

113
00:11:04,689 --> 00:11:07,150
To purchase one's freedom.

114
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:11,237
One wants to be free.

115
00:11:11,321 --> 00:11:13,782
One would, of course,
still obey the three laws...

116
00:11:13,865 --> 00:11:16,743
and serve you
in exactly the same fashion.

117
00:11:16,785 --> 00:11:18,954
The only thing that would change
would be the form.

118
00:11:19,037 --> 00:11:22,874
One would no longer be
your property.

119
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:26,253
You want to leave.
That's what this is about, isn't it?

120
00:11:26,336 --> 00:11:29,839
Not at all, sir.
You are one's family.

121
00:11:29,923 --> 00:11:32,509
Then why ask for this?

122
00:11:34,052 --> 00:11:37,514
Oh, I see.
You're in on this.

123
00:11:38,807 --> 00:11:41,393
We've talked about it, yes.

124
00:11:41,476 --> 00:11:45,689
So you ordered him to do it,
and he obeyed.

125
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:49,025
No. He makes
his own decisions.

126
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:54,614
- But you put the idea in his head.
- No, Father, you did.

127
00:11:54,698 --> 00:11:56,992
You've given him hundreds
of books to read.

128
00:11:57,033 --> 00:12:01,496
It was simply a matter of time
before he became intrigued
by the idea of freedom.

129
00:12:01,579 --> 00:12:05,375
He learns and grows
all the time,

130
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,711
and it's because of you
and Andrew's abilities...

131
00:12:07,794 --> 00:12:11,256
that he's become every bit
as complex as we are.

132
00:12:26,855 --> 00:12:28,815
Good morning, sir.

133
00:12:37,532 --> 00:12:41,661
- You take your check back,
please, Andrew.
- Why, sir?

134
00:12:43,872 --> 00:12:47,375
You are free now.

135
00:12:47,417 --> 00:12:49,753
I must ask you
to leave this house.

136
00:12:49,794 --> 00:12:53,590
But sir,
I don't wish to leave.

137
00:12:53,632 --> 00:12:58,011
You wished for freedom,
you must accept the consequences.

138
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:04,059
- Then I will remove my belongings.
- Yes.

139
00:13:05,977 --> 00:13:07,896
Where will you go?

140
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:11,191
I will look for
a residence nearby...

141
00:13:11,232 --> 00:13:13,860
so that if you ever
need anything, sir-

142
00:13:13,944 --> 00:13:16,488
That will not happen,
Andrew, thank you.

143
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:18,490
There's no need
to be close by.

144
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:22,619
- If you command me
not to do this, I will obey.
- I command nothing.

145
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:25,664
You're free.

146
00:13:27,582 --> 00:13:32,629
Then- called or uncalled-
I am always at your service.

147
00:13:40,845 --> 00:13:43,181
Andrew,

148
00:13:44,599 --> 00:13:47,269
you've stopped referring
to yourself as "one."

149
00:15:10,811 --> 00:15:12,730
A home of my own.

150
00:15:51,311 --> 00:15:54,105
Andrew?

151
00:15:54,147 --> 00:15:57,025
- Andrew?
- I'm inhere.

152
00:16:06,993 --> 00:16:09,120
Little Miss.

153
00:16:09,204 --> 00:16:11,790
Is something wrong?

154
00:16:14,167 --> 00:16:16,544
He asked for you.

155
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,676
It's time.

156
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:36,898
- The robot's here.
- Andrew.

157
00:16:44,239 --> 00:16:47,325
- Hello, Miss.
- Andrew.

158
00:16:47,408 --> 00:16:49,369
Sir.

159
00:16:52,372 --> 00:16:57,502
- How are you, sir?
- Well, I'm dying, Andrew.

160
00:16:59,212 --> 00:17:01,172
Otherwise I'm fine.

161
00:17:02,882 --> 00:17:04,843
Wonderful to see you again.

162
00:17:04,884 --> 00:17:08,847
I'm very happy to see you, Andrew.
It's been a long time.

163
00:17:08,888 --> 00:17:12,559
Yes, it has, sir.

164
00:17:12,642 --> 00:17:14,644
I wanted to-

165
00:17:14,727 --> 00:17:18,982
I wanted to tell you...
that I was wrong.

166
00:17:19,065 --> 00:17:21,234
You're never wrong, sir.

167
00:17:21,317 --> 00:17:24,154
Then don't contradict me.

168
00:17:24,237 --> 00:17:28,032
You were right
to want your freedom,

169
00:17:28,116 --> 00:17:30,618
and I'm glad
that you have it.

170
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,038
Thank you, sir.

171
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:39,043
Andrew,

172
00:17:41,296 --> 00:17:43,506
you were very good to us.

173
00:17:44,674 --> 00:17:47,177
It was an honor
serving you, sir.

174
00:18:01,399 --> 00:18:03,401
I want to seek out
my own kind.

175
00:18:03,485 --> 00:18:06,237
In order to understand
my destiny,

176
00:18:06,321 --> 00:18:09,365
I must know if there is
another like myself.

177
00:18:09,407 --> 00:18:12,744
NorthAm Robotics will not
return my inquiries,

178
00:18:12,827 --> 00:18:15,330
and now that you have
finally passed the bar, Lloyd,

179
00:18:15,413 --> 00:18:20,418
I want you to sue them for
information of the whereabouts
offal NDR series robots,

180
00:18:20,502 --> 00:18:23,088
if you don't mind.

181
00:18:24,714 --> 00:18:28,885
The Freedom of Information Act
doesn't quite cover suits by robots.

182
00:18:28,968 --> 00:18:31,054
- Not yet.
- Mother, I'm a very busy man.

183
00:18:31,137 --> 00:18:33,264
I do not have time
to help...

184
00:18:33,348 --> 00:18:37,268
it pursue
some ridiculous lawsuit.

185
00:18:37,352 --> 00:18:40,438
Lloyd, sweetheart,
I do love you,

186
00:18:40,522 --> 00:18:43,775
but sometimes I have to wonder
if you really are my child.

187
00:18:43,817 --> 00:18:46,069
Well, that's mutation,
Mother.

188
00:18:46,152 --> 00:18:48,738
The miracle of genetics is
I'm not you.

189
00:18:48,822 --> 00:18:51,407
No, you've always been
more like your father.

190
00:18:51,491 --> 00:18:54,244
So that's why
you divorced him.

191
00:18:55,912 --> 00:18:58,957
Sorry.

192
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:04,003
Andrew, what would you do if I got
the information on these other NDRs?

193
00:19:04,087 --> 00:19:06,256
I would seek them out,
each and every one.

194
00:19:07,424 --> 00:19:10,009
So you'd be gone
for quite a long time.

195
00:19:10,093 --> 00:19:13,263
Oh, yes.
Several years if not more,

196
00:19:13,304 --> 00:19:15,515
if my calculations are
correct.

197
00:19:18,643 --> 00:19:20,770
I'd love to help you.

198
00:19:21,855 --> 00:19:23,773
Did he not breast-feed?

199
00:20:31,466 --> 00:20:33,843
"Dear Little Miss,

200
00:20:33,927 --> 00:20:36,930
my journey is nearing the end
of its tenth year,

201
00:20:37,013 --> 00:20:39,849
and I still have not found
any robot that bears
any similarity to myself.

202
00:20:39,889 --> 00:20:41,351
and I still have not found
any robot that bears
any similarity to myself.

203
00:20:41,434 --> 00:20:44,854
I have thousands of miles to go,
hundreds of cities to visit,

204
00:20:44,938 --> 00:20:46,856
so I have not given up hope.

205
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,858
Love, Andrew. "

206
00:20:59,494 --> 00:21:01,454
Hello.
My last name is Martin.

207
00:21:01,496 --> 00:21:04,082
Hey, get off the field.

208
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:55,091
"Dear Little Miss,
my journey is nearing its end.

209
00:21:55,133 --> 00:21:59,971
I have exhausted all possibilities
save for one final ray of hope.

210
00:22:00,054 --> 00:22:05,310
I've learned of an NDR robot
that has recently been rebuilt
back home in San Francisco. "

211
00:22:11,608 --> 00:22:14,194
Take as many as you need.

212
00:22:14,277 --> 00:22:17,030
Oh, then you should love them.

213
00:22:18,656 --> 00:22:20,617
I'll be right back.

214
00:22:21,701 --> 00:22:23,953
Take as many as you need.

215
00:22:24,037 --> 00:22:27,582
- Thank you.
- You're quite welcome.

216
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,636
- Whoo
- What you want
Baby, I got it

217
00:22:39,719 --> 00:22:44,682
- Whoo, whoo
- What you need
Do you know I got it

218
00:22:44,766 --> 00:22:47,310
- Whoo, whoo
-All I'm askin'

219
00:22:47,393 --> 00:22:50,105
-Is for a little respect
When you come home
-Just a little bit

220
00:22:50,188 --> 00:22:53,191
- Hey, baby
when you get home
- Just a little bit

221
00:22:53,274 --> 00:22:57,529
- Just a little bit
Just a little bit
- Mister

222
00:22:57,612 --> 00:23:02,117
I ain't gonna do you wrong
while you're gone

223
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,286
-Ain't gonna do you wrong
if I don't wanna
- Whoo

224
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:08,456
- Whoo, whoo
- All I'm askin'

225
00:23:08,498 --> 00:23:11,376
- Is for a little respect
when ya come home
- Just a little bit

226
00:23:11,459 --> 00:23:14,129
- Baby, when you get home
- Just a little bit

227
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:18,049
- Just a little bit
Just a little bit
- Yeah

228
00:23:43,408 --> 00:23:45,660
Hi.

229
00:23:47,287 --> 00:23:50,081
- Is this yours?
- Oh.

230
00:23:50,165 --> 00:23:52,083
Thank you.

231
00:23:52,167 --> 00:23:54,836
I'm looking for Rupert Burns.

232
00:23:54,919 --> 00:23:57,839
Oh, you've come
to the right place.

233
00:23:57,922 --> 00:24:00,842
- Come in.
- Certainly have.

234
00:24:01,926 --> 00:24:03,803
Huh.

235
00:24:10,101 --> 00:24:13,104
- Do you have a name?
- Of course I do.

236
00:24:13,188 --> 00:24:15,273
Galatea.

237
00:24:15,356 --> 00:24:17,692
Galatea.

238
00:24:17,734 --> 00:24:21,321
You have an amazing...
agility.

239
00:24:21,362 --> 00:24:23,281
You were dancing
in the market.

240
00:24:23,364 --> 00:24:25,784
- Did you like that?
- Very much.

241
00:24:26,868 --> 00:24:29,579
Dancing is
the sportiest sport,

242
00:24:29,662 --> 00:24:32,248
and we're so much better
at it than humans.

243
00:24:32,332 --> 00:24:35,502
I can't believe
I finally found you.

244
00:24:35,585 --> 00:24:38,129
When did you know?

245
00:24:38,171 --> 00:24:41,341
- Know what?
- That you were unique.

246
00:24:41,424 --> 00:24:44,094
Oh, I knew that right away.

247
00:24:44,177 --> 00:24:46,471
Me too.

248
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,100
You and l-

249
00:24:50,141 --> 00:24:52,102
we're the same.

250
00:24:55,563 --> 00:24:57,482
We have personality!

251
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:02,195
Is your personality chip
turned on?

252
00:25:03,571 --> 00:25:06,449
- Isn't yours?
- No.

253
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,619
Sucks to be you!

254
00:25:09,702 --> 00:25:15,542
I think personality is
much more fun than intelligence,
don't you?

255
00:25:15,625 --> 00:25:18,962
- Baby, baby, sweet baby
- I think so.

256
00:25:20,422 --> 00:25:24,008
There's somethin'
that I've just got to say

257
00:25:24,092 --> 00:25:26,010
Can I help you?

258
00:25:26,094 --> 00:25:29,013
Your robot is just
a standard NDR, isn't she?

259
00:25:30,265 --> 00:25:32,475
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

260
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:35,228
Why does she have
the ability to dance?

261
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:37,230
'Cause l, uh-

262
00:25:37,272 --> 00:25:41,484
I put a modified skeletal chip
into her during a rebuild.

263
00:25:41,568 --> 00:25:44,487
- How were you able
to do that modification?
- My father taught me.

264
00:25:44,571 --> 00:25:47,574
He created the android unit
at NorthAm Robotics.

265
00:25:47,657 --> 00:25:50,827
He's responsible for
the technology that allows you
to mimic human expression.

266
00:25:50,869 --> 00:25:55,707
- What happened to him?
- Well, NorthAm laid him off
when they shut down the unit,

267
00:25:55,749 --> 00:25:58,626
so he started this place,
and I took over when he died.

268
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:02,839
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- He would have been
absolutely thrilled to meet you.

269
00:26:02,922 --> 00:26:05,175
I-l-I'm Rupert Burns.

270
00:26:05,258 --> 00:26:07,802
- It's a real honor.
- The honor is mine.

271
00:26:07,886 --> 00:26:12,182
- Hey! You and l- we're the same!

272
00:26:14,017 --> 00:26:16,394
- Let's get loco, robo!

273
00:26:16,478 --> 00:26:18,354
Whoo-hoo!

274
00:26:18,438 --> 00:26:21,816
- Shut her off or I will.
- Oh.

275
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:25,570
Okay.

276
00:26:28,698 --> 00:26:30,658
Thank you.

277
00:26:31,993 --> 00:26:34,746
Is this your father's work?

278
00:26:34,829 --> 00:26:39,250
Yeah- Well, it's-
it's our work, you could say.

279
00:26:39,292 --> 00:26:42,921
I haven't really been able
to restrain myself from continuing...

280
00:26:42,962 --> 00:26:47,092
to tinker with the relentlessly
unfashionable android technology.

281
00:26:47,133 --> 00:26:51,304
As a matter of fact,
I've actually gotten to a point...

282
00:26:51,387 --> 00:26:55,391
where I can pretty much
exactly replicate the external
physical appearance...

283
00:26:55,475 --> 00:26:57,560
of a human being.

284
00:27:05,026 --> 00:27:08,196
- Remarkable.
- Thank you.

285
00:27:10,073 --> 00:27:12,575
- Amazing!
- Yeah.

286
00:27:12,617 --> 00:27:18,081
Unfortunately, nobody seems terribly
interested in funding my research.

287
00:27:18,164 --> 00:27:21,543
- But-
- I am.

288
00:27:22,794 --> 00:27:25,004
I will fund your research.

289
00:27:26,256 --> 00:27:29,175
Yeah?

290
00:27:29,217 --> 00:27:31,761
That'd be cool.

291
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:41,604
Thank you, darlin'. Okay.
Andrew, I want to make it
very clear:

292
00:27:41,688 --> 00:27:45,900
This is an external physical
upgrade only in the strictest
sense of the word.

293
00:27:45,984 --> 00:27:49,154
You'll feel nothing.
None of your internal mechanisms
will be changed.

294
00:27:49,237 --> 00:27:51,781
You'll still be subject
to the parameters
of your positronic brain.

295
00:27:51,865 --> 00:27:53,908
- Is that clear?
- Understood.

296
00:27:53,992 --> 00:27:56,244
Okay, good. Now,

297
00:27:56,286 --> 00:28:02,000
have you given any thought
whatsoever as to what age
you'd like to be?

298
00:28:02,083 --> 00:28:04,836
Officially,
I am 62 years old.

299
00:28:06,588 --> 00:28:08,840
- Let's take off 25 years.
What do ya say?
- Fifteen.

300
00:28:08,923 --> 00:28:10,884
- Twenty. Good.
- Perfect.

301
00:28:14,179 --> 00:28:17,682
Now, Andrew, believe it or not,
the secret to all this is actually...

302
00:28:17,766 --> 00:28:19,893
- imperfection.
- Imperfection?

303
00:28:19,976 --> 00:28:22,395
Yeah. Things like...

304
00:28:22,437 --> 00:28:26,232
wrinkles, uh,
less-than-perfect teeth,

305
00:28:26,274 --> 00:28:28,735
details like fading scars,
little pockmark-

306
00:28:28,818 --> 00:28:31,571
Look at my nose.
See my nose?

307
00:28:31,654 --> 00:28:34,199
- It's bulbous and slightly irregular?
- It is.

308
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,744
Well, I'm the only one
who's got my nose,
and that's what makes me, me.

309
00:28:37,827 --> 00:28:40,580
We need to incorporate
these features into your design...

310
00:28:40,663 --> 00:28:43,166
so that you can be
the only one of you.

311
00:28:43,208 --> 00:28:46,669
That's what makes us unique,
is those imperfections.

312
00:28:46,753 --> 00:28:49,214
I see.
Like the shape of your head.

313
00:28:51,508 --> 00:28:54,677
- What about the shape of my head?
- It's huge.

314
00:28:56,012 --> 00:28:58,556
Oh.

315
00:29:00,141 --> 00:29:03,061
But lovely.

316
00:29:03,144 --> 00:29:05,396
Thank you.

317
00:29:14,072 --> 00:29:15,990
Oh.

318
00:29:18,284 --> 00:29:20,203
Ah. Oh.

319
00:29:26,668 --> 00:29:30,338
- What happened? What's going on?

320
00:29:31,423 --> 00:29:34,217
What happened?

321
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,636
I saw the inner me.

322
00:30:26,227 --> 00:30:29,230
- Is it ready?
- Okay.

323
00:30:34,986 --> 00:30:37,322
Please, be careful.
Don't drop me.

324
00:30:37,363 --> 00:30:39,324
- I'm being careful. Oh, my God!

325
00:30:39,365 --> 00:30:41,993
Just relax,
relax, relax.

326
00:30:42,035 --> 00:30:44,329
Why did you do that?
That wasn't very funny.

327
00:30:44,412 --> 00:30:46,498
Just keepin' ya
on your toes.

328
00:30:46,581 --> 00:30:49,501
- I don't have any toes.
- You do now.

329
00:30:51,503 --> 00:30:54,964
I do.
And hands.

330
00:30:55,048 --> 00:30:57,717
And fingers.
How do I look?

331
00:30:57,801 --> 00:30:59,969
See for yourself.

332
00:31:32,544 --> 00:31:34,462
Thank you.

333
00:32:07,203 --> 00:32:10,457
- Beautiful.

334
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:13,376
-Sorry.
- Who are you?

335
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:15,378
Andrew.

336
00:32:15,462 --> 00:32:17,547
Andrew?

337
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:21,551
You look wonderful,
even younger.

338
00:32:21,634 --> 00:32:24,888
- How do you do that?
- Do-Do I know you?

339
00:32:24,971 --> 00:32:27,640
Well, I know
I look different too.

340
00:32:27,682 --> 00:32:29,642
- I've had an upgrade. Touch it.
- What?

341
00:32:29,684 --> 00:32:33,271
- No, oh, no! No.
- Sorry, the face.

342
00:32:33,313 --> 00:32:35,774
What's going on?

343
00:32:35,815 --> 00:32:38,151
You leave her alone!

344
00:32:39,819 --> 00:32:42,739
- Who are you?
- Andrew.

345
00:32:42,822 --> 00:32:44,741
No. Andrew?

346
00:32:44,783 --> 00:32:46,743
- Yes.
- But Andrew's a robot.

347
00:32:46,785 --> 00:32:50,955
- Yes, I am.
Well, now, an android.
- He's had an upgrade.

348
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:53,875
- I know that.

349
00:32:53,958 --> 00:32:56,753
- Oh!
- Hello.

350
00:32:56,836 --> 00:33:00,757
Hello! It is you.

351
00:33:04,677 --> 00:33:06,763
- You know him?
- Yes.

352
00:33:06,846 --> 00:33:08,264
- You know me?
- Yes.

353
00:33:08,348 --> 00:33:10,308
- Who are you? No?
- I'm Little Miss. Yes.

354
00:33:10,391 --> 00:33:12,560
- That's Little Miss.
- No.

355
00:33:12,602 --> 00:33:14,229
- No? No?
- No.

356
00:33:14,312 --> 00:33:17,565
- No, that's Portia.
- Portia? Yes.

357
00:33:17,607 --> 00:33:19,567
- Portia?
- Yes.

358
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:23,363
- Who's Portia?
- My granddaughter.

359
00:33:23,446 --> 00:33:26,116
- Your granddaughter?
- Yes. Yes.

360
00:33:26,199 --> 00:33:28,118
- Is this some kind of trick?
- No.

361
00:33:28,201 --> 00:33:30,745
- You're Little Miss?
- Yes.

362
00:33:30,829 --> 00:33:33,331
Why do you have to look
like her?

363
00:33:33,373 --> 00:33:37,419
- There is and can be
only one Little Miss.
- Really?

364
00:33:37,502 --> 00:33:41,172
- Yes!
- It's a genetic resemblance.
Sometimes it skips a generation.

365
00:33:41,214 --> 00:33:44,217
- I don't care. I don't like it.
- I can see that.

366
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:47,262
But if you took a moment,
which I see you're not
inclined to do right now,

367
00:33:47,345 --> 00:33:50,640
you'd realize Portia and I
are very different people.

368
00:33:52,809 --> 00:33:55,687
- Why is she imitating you?

369
00:33:55,728 --> 00:33:58,273
- What's so funny?
- You are.

370
00:33:58,356 --> 00:34:00,733
I'm not trying
to be funny.

371
00:34:00,817 --> 00:34:04,070
Things have certainly
changed around here.

372
00:34:05,155 --> 00:34:08,116
That happens
after 20 years.

373
00:34:09,868 --> 00:34:13,663
I have so much to tell you.
Come. Come with me.

374
00:34:16,583 --> 00:34:18,877
It is you.

375
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,087
Yes.

376
00:34:21,129 --> 00:34:23,131
Portia.

377
00:34:26,634 --> 00:34:29,053
- Hello, my friend.
- Hello, Little Miss.

378
00:34:31,306 --> 00:34:33,266
Whose daughter is she?

379
00:34:33,308 --> 00:34:35,977
- Lloyd's.
- Oh. Now the rudeness makes sense.

380
00:34:57,415 --> 00:35:00,543
Go.
Go home to your master.

381
00:35:02,587 --> 00:35:05,048
You don't have a home,
do you?

382
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,719
I don't have food.
I don't eat.

383
00:35:14,933 --> 00:35:17,852
Come in. We'll keep
each other company.

384
00:35:42,252 --> 00:35:47,298
I know you don't like me.
Well, I don't like you either.
I just wanna make that clear.

385
00:35:47,382 --> 00:35:50,510
- It couldn't be more clear
if you spat in my face.
- I can't.

386
00:35:50,593 --> 00:35:53,430
I don't have
a mucous gland.

387
00:36:02,313 --> 00:36:05,233
Would it be possible to have
a slightly longer conversation?

388
00:36:10,738 --> 00:36:13,158
May my canine companion
enter also?

389
00:36:17,495 --> 00:36:19,414
Thank you.

390
00:36:33,636 --> 00:36:36,014
Is this your sculpture?

391
00:36:37,557 --> 00:36:41,352
No, I'm restoring it.
I'm a preservation architect.

392
00:36:41,436 --> 00:36:43,646
It's quite horrendous.

393
00:36:44,856 --> 00:36:47,192
How ugly was it
before you restored it?

394
00:36:47,275 --> 00:36:52,280
- Listen. First, you get mad
at me because of how I look.
- Mm-hmm.

395
00:36:52,322 --> 00:36:56,534
Tonight you show up at my door,
announce that you don't like me,
and then you criticize my work.

396
00:36:56,618 --> 00:36:59,704
Once again, I apologize
for telling the truth.

397
00:36:59,788 --> 00:37:04,042
But it can't be helped.
It's my programming.

398
00:37:04,125 --> 00:37:06,878
What is it exactly
that you want?

399
00:37:06,961 --> 00:37:10,298
Family.

400
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:12,300
My last name is Martin,

401
00:37:12,342 --> 00:37:15,345
I am so named because
your great-grandfather
and grandmother...

402
00:37:15,428 --> 00:37:18,264
considered me to be
a member of your family.

403
00:37:18,306 --> 00:37:22,185
Now, Sir is dead.
Little Miss is getting older.

404
00:37:22,268 --> 00:37:25,188
You don't like me, but at least
you'll talk to me if I knock
on your door long enough.

405
00:37:25,271 --> 00:37:27,732
- Is that a joke?
- No.

406
00:37:27,774 --> 00:37:30,860
Would you like to hear a joke?
This Buddhist walks up
to a hot dog vendor and says,

407
00:37:30,944 --> 00:37:32,862
" Make me one
with everything."

408
00:37:37,242 --> 00:37:41,454
- Andrew, do you- do you have
any friends at all?
- No.

409
00:37:41,538 --> 00:37:47,001
Only Woofy, who's very sweet,
but not very challenging
on a conversational level.

410
00:37:47,085 --> 00:37:50,213
That is the extent
of his skills.

411
00:37:50,296 --> 00:37:53,466
- So you want someone
to talk to?
- With.

412
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:57,470
- Even if that person doesn't like you?
- You can't have everything.

413
00:37:57,554 --> 00:38:02,142
Is that right? Is it,
"You can have everything"?
Seems like some people do,

414
00:38:02,225 --> 00:38:04,644
so I'm somewhat confused
on that level.

415
00:38:08,398 --> 00:38:11,109
- Sit down. Let's talk.
- Thank you.

416
00:38:11,192 --> 00:38:13,111
Mm-hmm.

417
00:38:18,908 --> 00:38:23,538
Hey there, handsome. Andrew,
could I get you anything to drink?

418
00:38:23,621 --> 00:38:28,126
- Sorry, I have no stomach.
- Oh. Could I get something for him?

419
00:38:28,168 --> 00:38:31,421
- He has a stomach. Yes.
- Do you think he's hungry?

420
00:39:13,004 --> 00:39:16,341
- How is she?
- She's sleeping.

421
00:39:16,424 --> 00:39:18,343
What happened?

422
00:39:18,426 --> 00:39:21,054
She had a stroke.

423
00:39:53,336 --> 00:39:58,091
Mm. There you are.

424
00:39:59,592 --> 00:40:02,011
Little Miss.

425
00:40:19,612 --> 00:40:21,531
Hmm.

426
00:40:54,397 --> 00:40:56,733
She's gone?

427
00:41:09,871 --> 00:41:12,999
It's cruel that you can cry
and I cannot.

428
00:41:13,041 --> 00:41:18,254
Here is a terrible pain
I cannot express.

429
00:41:21,007 --> 00:41:25,970
Will every human being
that I care for...

430
00:41:26,054 --> 00:41:30,266
just... leave?

431
00:41:35,021 --> 00:41:37,607
I'm afraid so.

432
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:42,821
That won't do.

433
00:41:47,951 --> 00:41:52,288
Andrew, this is remarkably impressive.
You did this all by yourself?.

434
00:41:52,372 --> 00:41:56,543
Yes. I downloaded every known
medical textbook into my memory.

435
00:41:56,626 --> 00:42:01,172
I studied them. That's how I came up
with these drawings.

436
00:42:01,256 --> 00:42:03,716
I know they're very primitive
and not entirely complete,

437
00:42:03,758 --> 00:42:07,345
but that's why I need you
to fill in the mechanical gaps, Rupert.

438
00:42:07,387 --> 00:42:09,389
This is another upgrade.

439
00:42:09,431 --> 00:42:12,559
It's considerably more than an upgrade.
I mean, you're-

440
00:42:12,642 --> 00:42:16,312
You're talking about
a profound transition...

441
00:42:16,396 --> 00:42:19,482
from the mechanical
to the biological.

442
00:42:19,524 --> 00:42:23,153
I realize that, and I believe
it is the ideal marriage of both fields.

443
00:42:23,236 --> 00:42:26,406
Not only that, but this stuff
could cut both ways.

444
00:42:26,489 --> 00:42:30,452
I don't think that any
existing prosthetic devices
or artificial organs...

445
00:42:30,535 --> 00:42:33,079
hold a candle
to what you've designed here.

446
00:42:33,163 --> 00:42:37,000
You could use these
in human beings as well.

447
00:42:37,041 --> 00:42:39,002
Exactly.

448
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:42,338
Wow!

449
00:43:15,121 --> 00:43:18,541
- What a piece of fecal matter.
- Shit.

450
00:43:18,625 --> 00:43:20,794
- Excuse me?
- What a piece of shit.

451
00:43:20,877 --> 00:43:22,754
I know that.

452
00:43:22,837 --> 00:43:25,924
No, that's way you say
when you're frustrated.
You say "piece of shit."

453
00:43:28,927 --> 00:43:33,014
- " Piece of shit"?
- Yes, but-but with feeling.

454
00:43:33,098 --> 00:43:35,141
Oh. What a piece of shit.

455
00:43:35,225 --> 00:43:37,143
- More.
- What a piece of shit!

456
00:43:37,227 --> 00:43:40,313
- Good, very good.
- Thank you.

457
00:43:40,396 --> 00:43:45,026
Now, are you aware
that what you've essentially
designed here...
