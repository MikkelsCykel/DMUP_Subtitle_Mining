1
00:00:15,555 --> 00:00:19,264
How I miss Scotland and the sea.

2
00:00:19,355 --> 00:00:23,109
The sea. There's nothing like it
in all the earth.

3
00:00:24,195 --> 00:00:27,028
Salt in your face, the wind at your back

4
00:00:27,275 --> 00:00:29,345
and all the world before you.

5
00:00:29,435 --> 00:00:33,189
Freer than a bird in the air
or a fish in the ocean.

6
00:00:34,115 --> 00:00:40,065
To be free. I reckon that's why I joined
the second war to end all wars.

7
00:00:49,755 --> 00:00:53,828
I was studying to be a teacher
when the call to arms occurred.

8
00:00:53,915 --> 00:00:57,749
I eagerly put aside my studies
for the glory of action.

9
00:00:57,835 --> 00:01:00,395
I stopped reading history

10
00:01:00,475 --> 00:01:02,545
and became a part of it.

11
00:01:02,635 --> 00:01:05,991
I joined the Argyll
and Sutherland Highlanders

12
00:01:06,235 --> 00:01:08,954
and became Captain Ernest Gordon.

13
00:01:10,555 --> 00:01:14,628
My commanding officer was
Lieutenant Colonel Stuart McLean

14
00:01:14,715 --> 00:01:17,991
the finest commander
the 93rd Battalion ever had.

15
00:01:18,075 --> 00:01:21,351
A man of deep loyalties to his country

16
00:01:21,435 --> 00:01:24,472
his duty and his men.

17
00:01:24,555 --> 00:01:30,391
A loyalty that was soon to be matched by
his second-in-command, Major lan Campbell

18
00:01:30,475 --> 00:01:34,514
a man of passionate devotion
to the Colonel as well as the cause.

19
00:01:37,235 --> 00:01:41,023
It was our loyalties
that would eventually be tested.

20
00:01:41,115 --> 00:01:44,903
The Argylls had a legacy of being
the last line of defence.

21
00:01:46,635 --> 00:01:49,752
And we were to prove that legacy
once again

22
00:01:50,835 --> 00:01:54,748
in the face of defeat and capture
by the enemy.

23
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:51,674
Sir? Sir?

24
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:54,030
Are you all right, sir?

25
00:02:54,115 --> 00:02:58,028
You look the devil in the face
with pride, boys!

26
00:02:59,555 --> 00:03:01,864
And try not to shit your kilts!

27
00:03:13,715 --> 00:03:15,626
Bastards are playing with our minds.

28
00:04:23,755 --> 00:04:28,670
When you surrender in war
you're stripped of your dignity as a soldier.

29
00:04:28,755 --> 00:04:34,910
All you've got left is your fellow comrades
many of whom you've just met.

30
00:04:34,995 --> 00:04:39,864
Lieutenant Jim Reardon, Merchant Marine
one of the few Americans in the area.

31
00:04:39,955 --> 00:04:43,425
Attached himself to the Argylls
during the Allied surrender.

32
00:04:43,515 --> 00:04:48,714
We called him Yanker 'cause he was
an American and a bit of a wanker.

33
00:05:55,475 --> 00:05:58,387
Parade... halt!

34
00:06:03,235 --> 00:06:05,146
What's that stench?

35
00:06:06,675 --> 00:06:08,586
That'll be death, Major.

36
00:06:40,155 --> 00:06:42,874
Parade... right wheel!

37
00:06:47,395 --> 00:06:49,465
Parade... halt!

38
00:06:50,675 --> 00:06:52,791
Left turn!

39
00:06:54,515 --> 00:06:56,426
Stand at ease!

40
00:07:01,115 --> 00:07:02,514
Stand easy.

41
00:07:08,035 --> 00:07:10,310
Tenko!

42
00:07:10,395 --> 00:07:12,386
Kiotsuke!

43
00:07:12,475 --> 00:07:15,069
What the hell does "tenko" mean?

44
00:07:15,315 --> 00:07:17,226
Must be roll call.

45
00:07:23,435 --> 00:07:26,950
Today, you will count off in English

46
00:07:27,035 --> 00:07:30,425
but tomorrow and for ever, in Japanese.

47
00:07:52,675 --> 00:07:55,872
- Start counting!
- One.

48
00:07:55,955 --> 00:07:57,547
- Two.
- Three.

49
00:07:59,915 --> 00:08:02,713
Big-eared Nip!

50
00:08:06,715 --> 00:08:08,626
Bastard!

51
00:08:11,275 --> 00:08:13,425
Kora!

52
00:08:20,995 --> 00:08:24,908
This is a shame culture. Make 'em
lose face, you'll pay. Stand easy.

53
00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:32,753
This is an outrage! I am a senior officer.

54
00:08:32,835 --> 00:08:36,350
I will not tolerate this barbaric behaviour.

55
00:08:37,155 --> 00:08:39,066
This man has rights!

56
00:09:04,435 --> 00:09:06,744
Kiotsuke.

57
00:09:20,155 --> 00:09:26,708
Attention, prisoners. You are now captives
of His lmperial Majesty, the Emperor.

58
00:09:35,995 --> 00:09:40,591
Behold... the extreme penalty
for those who try to escape.

59
00:10:04,115 --> 00:10:06,026
This is for your own sake.

60
00:10:07,195 --> 00:10:11,586
You will sign these papers
promising not to escape.

61
00:10:17,635 --> 00:10:21,708
- No escape, my Yankee ass!
- This is against the Geneva Convention.

62
00:10:21,795 --> 00:10:24,434
They don't give two shits about that.

63
00:10:24,515 --> 00:10:29,987
Tomorrow, you will bring these
signed papers from all prisoners.

64
00:10:31,315 --> 00:10:33,351
You are dismissed.

65
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:19,343
Go, go.

66
00:11:46,275 --> 00:11:50,348
- What did you just say?
- I told him you were stupid.

67
00:11:50,435 --> 00:11:55,828
I don't know whether to thank you
or kick your arse. Lan Campbell.

68
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:57,985
Dusty Miller.

69
00:11:58,075 --> 00:12:00,543
Where did you learn to speak Japanese?

70
00:12:01,635 --> 00:12:03,705
What about the Colonel?

71
00:12:03,795 --> 00:12:06,468
You want your Colonel back?

72
00:12:06,555 --> 00:12:08,466
I owe the man my life.

73
00:12:10,435 --> 00:12:13,313
- The more hair, the more lice.
- Ow!

74
00:12:14,235 --> 00:12:18,023
Stay close to your cobbers.

75
00:12:18,115 --> 00:12:23,235
But when it comes down to it, it's survival
of the fittest. Every man for himself.

76
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:26,947
Barter is the name of the game, gents.

77
00:12:27,195 --> 00:12:32,110
They call the hospital the Death House.
You don't wanna end up in here.

78
00:12:33,395 --> 00:12:38,423
Relish your health now, gentlemen.
It's the last you'll see of it.

79
00:12:38,515 --> 00:12:42,906
There are thousands more prisoners
in camps all along the river.

80
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:46,067
Not too much skinny here from the outside.

81
00:12:46,155 --> 00:12:48,430
Japs keep us in the dark.

82
00:12:48,515 --> 00:12:52,906
No radios. They catch one, they'll kill you.

83
00:12:55,155 --> 00:12:58,943
Officers, try to keep your shirt on.

84
00:12:59,035 --> 00:13:00,946
It'll distinguish you from the grunts

85
00:13:01,195 --> 00:13:06,110
the only thing keeping us from degenerating
into a bloody anarchy.

86
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,274
Shit!

87
00:13:34,795 --> 00:13:38,470
- Where you goin'?
- To find out about the Colonel.

88
00:13:38,555 --> 00:13:41,023
You're just asking for trouble.

89
00:14:05,555 --> 00:14:08,274
- Doc.
- Get him down here.

90
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:15,343
Easy... easy.

91
00:14:15,435 --> 00:14:18,074
It's my back, my back... my back.

92
00:14:20,635 --> 00:14:23,911
- What the bloody hell happened?
- You didn't bow.

93
00:14:23,995 --> 00:14:29,274
- What?
- Always bow before a guard. Korean or Jap.

94
00:14:29,355 --> 00:14:33,507
Never look 'em in the eyes when they're
bashing you. That's pure defiance.

95
00:14:33,595 --> 00:14:35,950
- Rules of Bushido.
- Bushido?

96
00:14:36,035 --> 00:14:39,948
Their kind of chivalry.
Respect and obligation.

97
00:14:40,195 --> 00:14:44,427
If you don't respect 'em, they feel obligated
to bash you. Nothing personal.

98
00:14:44,515 --> 00:14:47,029
It sure bloody well feels personal.

99
00:14:47,275 --> 00:14:50,950
It works both ways.
They do the same to their own.

100
00:14:51,195 --> 00:14:53,993
- That's a comfort.
- Now, listen, you must understand.

101
00:14:54,235 --> 00:14:59,628
These monsters truly believe
we're an inferior race, less than human.

102
00:14:59,715 --> 00:15:04,027
Now, beating a prisoner to them
is like beating a disobedient dog.

103
00:15:04,275 --> 00:15:08,188
The fiercer the beating, the fiercer
their dedication to the Emperor.

104
00:15:09,795 --> 00:15:11,706
You'll be all right, son.

105
00:15:14,235 --> 00:15:16,146
Make space for the Colonel.

106
00:15:17,355 --> 00:15:20,267
You're buggers
for punishment, you lot.

107
00:15:29,275 --> 00:15:32,187
You should've let him take me instead, sir.

108
00:15:34,235 --> 00:15:39,548
- Anything we can do for you, Colonel?
- Aye... start preparing.

109
00:15:41,075 --> 00:15:43,794
- Preparing for what?
- Escape.

110
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:47,673
What else, you tow-headed Yank?

111
00:15:47,755 --> 00:15:49,666
Dusty...

112
00:15:52,195 --> 00:15:54,151
...thank you.

113
00:16:00,315 --> 00:16:03,830
Colonel, I've been watching these Nips.

114
00:16:03,915 --> 00:16:08,864
There's never more than a handful guarding
the perimeter. They're not watching closely.

115
00:16:08,955 --> 00:16:12,027
- It doesn't make sense unless...
- What?

116
00:16:12,115 --> 00:16:17,064
Unless every prisoner's been caught
or died in a thousand miles of jungle.

117
00:16:17,315 --> 00:16:21,388
Unless local villagers will turn in
a POW for a bowl of rice.

118
00:16:21,475 --> 00:16:24,592
Unless... escape is impossible.

119
00:16:25,915 --> 00:16:28,383
Excellent!

120
00:16:28,475 --> 00:16:33,754
Yanker... you find the best escape route,
hm?

121
00:16:34,675 --> 00:16:36,074
- Lan...
- Yes, sir?

122
00:16:36,315 --> 00:16:39,227
Start getting survival gear together.

123
00:16:40,835 --> 00:16:45,863
Ernest... get things together
we can trade with the locals.

124
00:16:45,955 --> 00:16:47,434
Yes, sir.

125
00:16:47,515 --> 00:16:50,951
As soon as I'm well... we're on our way.

126
00:16:51,195 --> 00:16:52,674
- Yes, sir.
- OK?

127
00:16:52,755 --> 00:16:55,064
- Yes, sir!
- Sir.

128
00:16:55,315 --> 00:16:57,226
Good boys.

129
00:16:58,435 --> 00:17:01,347
You're good boys. That's my boys.

130
00:17:20,595 --> 00:17:25,464
Hey... how about some extra for
my Colonel. He's in the Death House.

131
00:17:25,555 --> 00:17:30,834
If he can't make it, it means he can't work
so he can't eat. Nip rules. Move along.

132
00:17:32,435 --> 00:17:35,950
- Come on, pal, I'll owe you one.
- He said move along!

133
00:17:38,155 --> 00:17:40,828
You sheep-humping Highlander!

134
00:17:41,915 --> 00:17:43,633
Come on!

135
00:17:54,675 --> 00:17:56,984
What are you, bloody chicken?

136
00:17:57,235 --> 00:18:00,227
- I'll kick your arse!
- Come on, you English fuck!

137
00:18:04,915 --> 00:18:06,826
Come on, then, wanker!

138
00:18:09,475 --> 00:18:11,466
Come on!

139
00:18:17,155 --> 00:18:20,670
What does it take
for a man to lose his dignity?

140
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:27,949
Come on, you English fuck!

141
00:18:28,195 --> 00:18:32,108
How far can he fall
to pay the price of survival?

142
00:18:54,155 --> 00:18:59,070
Dusty built a sanctuary outside the camp
called The Church Without Walls.

143
00:18:59,315 --> 00:19:04,230
We were allowed to visit it freely.
They knew we had nowhere to go.

144
00:19:24,275 --> 00:19:27,984
Tell you what I'm gonnae do
when I get back to Glasgow.

145
00:19:28,235 --> 00:19:31,352
I'm gonna visit my favourite pub

146
00:19:31,435 --> 00:19:35,064
I'm gonnae sink 14 whiskies
and seven pints...

147
00:19:39,515 --> 00:19:43,030
...and spend the night in the arms
of my wee wife.

148
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:47,154
- You married, sir?
- No. If you've got a sister, I'm available!

149
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:52,433
What about you, Ernie?

150
00:19:52,515 --> 00:19:54,426
Probably teach.

151
00:19:56,915 --> 00:19:59,383
I've always fancied teaching.

152
00:20:01,635 --> 00:20:05,594
- I thought I'd see the world first.
- You got that wish.

153
00:20:06,475 --> 00:20:07,794
Aye.

154
00:20:09,915 --> 00:20:14,272
When I get outta here, I'm gonna go
into business and get stinking rich.

155
00:20:15,195 --> 00:20:19,347
- What kind of business?
- Black market, prostitution.

156
00:20:19,435 --> 00:20:22,984
You're not gonna make much money
as a prostitute!

157
00:20:25,395 --> 00:20:27,306
What about you, sir?

158
00:20:29,315 --> 00:20:32,990
What are you gonna do after the war?

159
00:20:33,075 --> 00:20:35,589
Start preparing for the next war.

160
00:20:59,955 --> 00:21:03,072
In the Bushido code, the nation is
everything.

161
00:21:03,155 --> 00:21:08,070
The individual is nothing. Conformity is
how they gain their sense of purpose.

162
00:21:08,315 --> 00:21:11,910
They expected us to fall in line, as well.

163
00:21:25,155 --> 00:21:27,066
What are we saying, Dusty?

164
00:21:27,315 --> 00:21:30,432
Loyalty, politeness, frugality. Soldier's duty.

165
00:21:32,235 --> 00:21:33,714
Just dandy!

166
00:22:05,035 --> 00:22:06,946
Carry on, Sergeant Major.

167
00:22:07,195 --> 00:22:09,914
Parade! Parade, 'shun!

168
00:22:11,235 --> 00:22:13,146
About face!

169
00:22:50,755 --> 00:22:54,987
All show respect for Honourable
Lieutenant Colonel Nagatomo

170
00:22:55,235 --> 00:22:57,874
Chief of Thailand POW Administration.

171
00:23:15,875 --> 00:23:17,593
I think she fancies me.

172
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:33,747
It is great pleasure for me
to see you at this place.

173
00:23:35,395 --> 00:23:41,391
You are few remaining skeleton
of our victory and our pitiful victim.

174
00:23:41,475 --> 00:23:44,467
You should weep with gratitude

175
00:23:44,555 --> 00:23:48,434
at His lmperial Majesty, the Emperor

176
00:23:48,515 --> 00:23:50,904
who pity you for being coward.

177
00:23:53,235 --> 00:23:56,352
- What's he talking about, cowards?
- Rules of Bushido.

178
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:59,632
They believe the losers
should kill themselves.

179
00:24:00,715 --> 00:24:02,751
You will give me great pleasure

180
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:05,745
to build a railroad

181
00:24:05,835 --> 00:24:11,944
through the jungle to the glory
of His lmperial Majesty, the Emperor!

182
00:24:12,195 --> 00:24:15,073
Saviour of Japan!

183
00:24:15,155 --> 00:24:16,873
Saviour of Asia!

184
00:24:19,035 --> 00:24:22,584
We will build this railroad

185
00:24:22,675 --> 00:24:27,590
if we have to build it
over the white man's body.

186
00:24:29,955 --> 00:24:32,992
It is your purification.

187
00:25:08,635 --> 00:25:12,344
Railroad to be 420 kilometre

188
00:25:13,715 --> 00:25:17,344
from Chungkai base camp
to Thanbyuzayat in north.

189
00:25:26,155 --> 00:25:28,953
You will build the railroad in 18 months.

190
00:25:29,035 --> 00:25:30,991
18 months?

191
00:25:32,075 --> 00:25:36,546
How will my men manage that
on the rations you're feeding them, hm?

192
00:25:43,355 --> 00:25:45,391
Officers work, as well.

193
00:25:52,715 --> 00:25:55,627
Royal Engineer will oversee building.

194
00:26:02,915 --> 00:26:05,031
Where are the signed papers?

195
00:26:06,795 --> 00:26:14,634
Gentlemen... as you have violated
the Geneva Convention

196
00:26:14,715 --> 00:26:18,071
the Hague Convention

197
00:26:18,315 --> 00:26:23,343
and every human right
for properly supervised prisoners of war

198
00:26:23,435 --> 00:26:28,634
may I respectfully recommend
that you and your fascist monkeys...

199
00:26:30,195 --> 00:26:34,746
...stick your head up your arse
because we will not sign

200
00:26:34,835 --> 00:26:37,349
your bloody paper!

201
00:26:37,435 --> 00:26:39,949
Now, translate that!

202
00:26:46,435 --> 00:26:49,154
I am sick of this drivel!

203
00:26:53,395 --> 00:26:55,113
Gentlemen.

204
00:27:12,155 --> 00:27:14,066
Look after my boys, lan.

205
00:27:18,915 --> 00:27:21,429
It is regrettable

206
00:27:21,515 --> 00:27:25,030
but we take each of you
and shoot one by one...

207
00:27:26,275 --> 00:27:27,947
S... Sir?!

208
00:27:28,195 --> 00:27:31,312
...until you respect Emperor!

209
00:27:33,635 --> 00:27:35,751
Fuck! Fuck!

210
00:27:35,835 --> 00:27:41,034
- Come on, man, out of here!
- Fucking bastard! Fucking bastard!

211
00:27:48,635 --> 00:27:54,665
- What happened? What happened?
- Fucking shot him! Fucking shot him!

212
00:27:55,835 --> 00:28:00,431
It's the Colonel's blood!
It's the Colonel's blood!

213
00:28:02,195 --> 00:28:05,267
Fucking shot him! The bastard!

214
00:28:05,355 --> 00:28:06,868
Major.

215
00:29:04,595 --> 00:29:06,745
Don't let him go!

216
00:29:15,515 --> 00:29:17,392
You fucking bastard!

217
00:29:42,555 --> 00:29:45,023
There's nothing you can do.

218
00:29:45,115 --> 00:29:50,394
What are we gonnae do?
What are we gonnae do?

219
00:29:50,475 --> 00:29:55,390
What the fuck are we gonna do now?
What the fuck are we gonna do now?

220
00:29:59,955 --> 00:30:02,071
Verily, verily, I say unto you.

221
00:30:04,315 --> 00:30:10,151
Except a corn of wheat fall into
the ground and die, it abideth alone.

222
00:30:11,235 --> 00:30:13,510
But if it die

223
00:30:13,595 --> 00:30:15,984
it bringeth forth much fruit.

224
00:30:22,115 --> 00:30:24,026
There is suffering before glory.

225
00:30:28,315 --> 00:30:30,590
There is a cross...

226
00:30:30,675 --> 00:30:32,586
...before the crown.

227
00:30:49,155 --> 00:30:51,544
Outward turn!

228
00:30:54,835 --> 00:30:57,224
Slow... march!

229
00:31:42,755 --> 00:31:43,983
Cheers.

230
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:46,146
I'm no' leaving.

231
00:31:48,675 --> 00:31:49,994
What?

232
00:31:51,355 --> 00:31:54,028
I said, I'm no' leaving.

233
00:31:54,115 --> 00:31:56,231
What about our plan?

234
00:31:58,395 --> 00:32:00,511
I owed the Colonel my life...

235
00:32:02,315 --> 00:32:07,708
and I watched him die in front of my eyes
and I just stood there doing nothing.

236
00:32:08,075 --> 00:32:11,545
You think you're the only one
suffering here?

237
00:32:11,635 --> 00:32:13,546
Oh, waken up!

238
00:32:14,675 --> 00:32:20,784
There's a reason every escape has
failed and why the Japs don't give
a toss about security!

239
00:32:23,475 --> 00:32:27,184
We were fools to think we even stood a
chance.

240
00:32:29,875 --> 00:32:31,786
I've got my own plans now.

241
00:32:35,435 --> 00:32:37,949
You are a selfish bastard.

242
00:32:40,355 --> 00:32:42,266
Come on, Ernie.

243
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:46,983
Ernie!

244
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:54,108
Fine!

245
00:32:55,035 --> 00:32:56,991
Yanker, wait a minute!

246
00:32:57,955 --> 00:33:02,665
Yanker, wait! You'll never make it
on your own in that jungle! It's suicide!

247
00:33:02,755 --> 00:33:08,910
Take a look around you! Look in the eyes
of these men! You tell me what you see.

248
00:33:08,995 --> 00:33:13,511
That's right. They're dead already.
You know it and I know it.

249
00:33:13,595 --> 00:33:19,386
Everybody in there does, too
and that scares the fucking hell out of me!

250
00:33:19,475 --> 00:33:23,150
Because at least with escape...
it gave us one thing.

251
00:33:24,235 --> 00:33:29,673
Hope. Hope. Because without that
we might as well be sitting in there

252
00:33:29,755 --> 00:33:35,785
with our thumbs up our asses waiting
for the end! Is that what you want?

253
00:33:35,875 --> 00:33:38,673
Let me tell you something about me.

254
00:33:38,755 --> 00:33:41,827
I am not a stupid man

255
00:33:41,915 --> 00:33:44,987
and I am not a kamikaze.

256
00:33:45,075 --> 00:33:48,624
If I can't escape, I'll do the next best thing.

257
00:33:48,715 --> 00:33:53,266
I will take care of myself
and that's exactly what I plan on doing.

258
00:33:53,355 --> 00:33:57,394
Yanker, we are all in this
all of us, together.

259
00:33:57,475 --> 00:34:00,592
Sure, kid, every single one of us.

260
00:34:19,275 --> 00:34:22,347
The Japanese
were preparing to invade India.

261
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:27,190
The railway would be their supply line.
We would be the means to their end.

262
00:34:44,235 --> 00:34:48,945
When you're living to die
every minute is an eternity.

263
00:34:49,035 --> 00:34:53,392
Days are lost.
Months blend into one another.

264
00:34:53,475 --> 00:34:56,751
The only reality you know is in the moment

265
00:34:56,835 --> 00:35:00,305
and the moment hangs over you like death.

266
00:35:00,395 --> 00:35:04,946
It's difficult to describe what it's like
to live with permanent hunger

267
00:35:05,035 --> 00:35:08,948
and the stench of disease and death
with every breath you take.

268
00:35:09,195 --> 00:35:14,269
Malaria, diphtheria, pellagra, dysentery

269
00:35:14,355 --> 00:35:17,631
sucks every ounce of fluid out of your body.

270
00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:21,390
Your muscles cramp up
and your circulation collapses.

271
00:35:21,475 --> 00:35:23,750
Major!

272
00:35:23,835 --> 00:35:26,827
He's burning up. Ernie!

273
00:35:33,435 --> 00:35:37,144
I don't know anybody
who could survive that lot.

274
00:35:44,915 --> 00:35:46,826
Oh, Ernie, son...

275
00:35:49,075 --> 00:35:51,191
...you were a good soldier...

276
00:35:52,995 --> 00:35:54,906
...and a good friend.

277
00:36:08,755 --> 00:36:10,871
So this is death.

278
00:36:11,955 --> 00:36:13,183
Dark...

279
00:36:14,875 --> 00:36:16,388
...cold.

280
00:36:17,395 --> 00:36:19,306
All alone.

281
00:36:20,795 --> 00:36:24,913
No more reason to fight
so they gave up on you.

282
00:36:26,075 --> 00:36:29,954
In death, there is no second chance.

283
00:36:30,035 --> 00:36:33,311
That's what you think about
when you're dying.

284
00:36:33,395 --> 00:36:40,073
The real value of all that you've done with
your life... and all that you might've done

285
00:36:40,155 --> 00:36:43,272
if only you'd had a second chance.

286
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:29,110
Bloody hell! These Nip bastards
are eating like the Prince of Wales!

287
00:37:34,355 --> 00:37:39,873
Life doesn't wait for the individual
especially life as a prisoner of war.

288
00:37:43,835 --> 00:37:48,909
If you want to survive, you need
a bit of luck, a quick wit

289
00:37:48,995 --> 00:37:52,465
and a mate to pick you up
when you fall.

290
00:38:02,755 --> 00:38:06,748
- Where am I?
- You've been unconscious for days.

291
00:38:10,355 --> 00:38:15,304
I thought if I got you into the fresh air
you'd have more chance of surviving.

292
00:38:15,395 --> 00:38:18,512
I don't know if I want to survive any more.

293
00:38:22,515 --> 00:38:24,233
Open up.

294
00:38:25,315 --> 00:38:29,786
- How did you get the food?
- I have my connections. Open up.

295
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:32,866
Why are you doing this?

296
00:38:41,755 --> 00:38:43,666
Hey, Ernie.

297
00:38:46,635 --> 00:38:52,505
Er... me and the cobbers
we've been chewing it over...

298
00:38:52,595 --> 00:38:55,553
...and we got thinking.

299
00:38:57,435 --> 00:39:01,314
What's the purpose
in what we've been suffering?

300
00:39:01,395 --> 00:39:05,946
Where's the justice in Nips bashing us
and working us to death?

301
00:39:06,035 --> 00:39:10,711
What's worse, we're killing each other
to save our own skins.

302
00:39:10,795 --> 00:39:13,070
What exactly are you asking me?

303
00:39:13,315 --> 00:39:15,704
You said you wanted to be a teacher.

304
00:39:16,595 --> 00:39:17,994
Yeah.

305
00:39:18,075 --> 00:39:21,988
We thought that you might have
some answers, sir.

306
00:39:22,075 --> 00:39:27,433
Would you like me to take a lecture
on the meaning of life (?)

307
00:39:27,515 --> 00:39:30,746
Oh, that's a bloody fine idea, sir!

308
00:39:33,035 --> 00:39:34,946
Please...

309
00:39:36,675 --> 00:39:38,791
...just leave me alone.

310
00:39:41,275 --> 00:39:43,584
That's what I figured.

311
00:39:52,195 --> 00:39:58,987
You know, a man can experience an
incredible amount of pain and suffering
if he has hope.

312
00:39:59,075 --> 00:40:00,986
When he loses his hope...

313
00:40:02,715 --> 00:40:04,671
...that's when he dies.

314
00:40:24,915 --> 00:40:27,031
Shit. I gotta take a shit.

315
00:40:36,315 --> 00:40:38,033
Come on!

316
00:40:39,035 --> 00:40:43,790
Reardon made a connection
to the local Thai black market.

317
00:40:43,875 --> 00:40:48,585
He wouldn't share it for fear of being
discovered. That's what he told us.

318
00:40:59,595 --> 00:41:02,428
Good God, Yanker, that's stinkin'!

319
00:41:03,275 --> 00:41:05,345
My dear Major Campbell

320
00:41:05,435 --> 00:41:08,507
this is the scent of happiness
nectar of the gods.

321
00:41:08,595 --> 00:41:11,029
Our ticket to numbness.

322
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:16,554
Fermented rice alcohol.
This one's on the house.

323
00:41:31,475 --> 00:41:33,193
Bastard!

324
00:41:35,915 --> 00:41:38,634
- He's done it!
- 'Course I've done it!

325
00:41:39,915 --> 00:41:43,703
- Nice one, Yanker. Let's have a swig.
- Whoa, gentlemen!

326
00:41:43,795 --> 00:41:46,468
If you want charity, go to church.

327
00:41:46,555 --> 00:41:50,833
I'm bartering my way to happiness.
So pony up with some cash.

328
00:41:50,915 --> 00:41:56,114
Don't be shy. Line starts right here.
Two cigarettes.

329
00:42:01,915 --> 00:42:06,625
You've got to get out of this rain.
Come on, walk.

330
00:42:09,275 --> 00:42:13,314
- Ernie, you're still alive!
- Lazarus! Back frae the dead!

331
00:42:13,395 --> 00:42:18,674
- I kinda wish I'd stayed there, sir.
- Bollocks! We need you alive! Hey!

332
00:42:18,755 --> 00:42:21,952
- Come on.
- What's wrong?

333
00:42:22,035 --> 00:42:23,946
He hasn't eaten.

334
00:42:26,115 --> 00:42:28,390
He got me extra rations.

335
00:42:28,475 --> 00:42:32,354
He never got you extra rations.
He was giving you his.

336
00:42:32,435 --> 00:42:34,391
Help me with his legs.

337
00:42:55,395 --> 00:42:58,865
I learned that
while Dusty was taking care of me

338
00:42:58,955 --> 00:43:01,230
the Major was preparing his own plans.

339
00:43:02,075 --> 00:43:05,192
Just what... I couldn't tell.

340
00:43:30,155 --> 00:43:32,430
No, no, no.

341
00:43:32,515 --> 00:43:34,745
Where did you get the food?

342
00:43:34,835 --> 00:43:36,951
Multiple anonymous donors.

343
00:43:37,195 --> 00:43:38,913
Eat.

344
00:43:50,795 --> 00:43:54,549
I've decided to start a school
for the Jocks.

345
00:43:54,635 --> 00:43:56,546
A jungle university.

346
00:43:57,675 --> 00:44:00,348
I've already made my own blackboard.

347
00:44:00,435 --> 00:44:02,995
Yanker rustled me up a text book.

348
00:44:03,075 --> 00:44:04,986
For no small price.

349
00:44:06,075 --> 00:44:09,988
First class is this evening.
I've got six students already.

350
00:44:11,395 --> 00:44:13,511
I know it's small but... um...

351
00:44:14,955 --> 00:44:17,674
...it's a start.

352
00:44:18,955 --> 00:44:21,753
I don't wanna be the sceptic here

353
00:44:21,835 --> 00:44:26,625
but how can you engage in a group activity
without the Nips seeing you?

354
00:44:26,715 --> 00:44:29,991
In the one place the Nips will never go near.

355
00:44:41,235 --> 00:44:44,910
- This stench is intolerable.
- Shut your cake-hole!

356
00:44:44,995 --> 00:44:48,067
We're doing the best we can. Get used to it.

357
00:44:48,155 --> 00:44:51,227
Make yourselves as comfortable as you can.

358
00:44:52,995 --> 00:44:55,031
Let's get started, eh?

359
00:44:59,595 --> 00:45:02,314
I'd like to speak to you about Plato.

360
00:45:03,395 --> 00:45:05,863
Um... right.

361
00:45:07,355 --> 00:45:08,947
What...

362
00:45:12,635 --> 00:45:15,593
...is... justice?

363
00:45:37,595 --> 00:45:39,506
Excuse me, sir. Sir.

364
00:45:41,395 --> 00:45:44,467
Is it true you're giving
educational classes?

365
00:45:44,555 --> 00:45:46,466
We'd like to help teach.

366
00:45:47,675 --> 00:45:49,745
What's your story?

367
00:45:49,835 --> 00:45:52,508
Roger Primrose, trained in the fine arts.

368
00:45:52,595 --> 00:45:57,669
Lieutenant Foxworth used to teach
Shakespeare at Cambridge. I'm his
platoon sergeant.

369
00:45:57,755 --> 00:46:01,668
Poor blighter's at a loss
without his books and the Bard.

370
00:46:02,875 --> 00:46:07,391
If I can keep him busy long enough
he won't end up killing himself.

371
00:46:09,515 --> 00:46:12,985
I'm... not joking, sir.

372
00:46:13,075 --> 00:46:16,784
Unfortunately, we don't have
any Shakespeare.

373
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:24,826
To die, to sleep, -
No more; and by a sleep to say we end

374
00:46:24,915 --> 00:46:29,067
The heart-ache, and the thousand
natural shocks that flesh is heir to

375
00:46:29,155 --> 00:46:32,067
'tis a consummation devoutly to be wish'd.

376
00:46:32,315 --> 00:46:35,546
To die... to sleep;

377
00:46:35,635 --> 00:46:39,310
To sleep! Perchance to dream:
Ay, there's the rub;

378
00:46:39,395 --> 00:46:43,786
For in that sleep of death
what dreams may come

379
00:46:43,875 --> 00:46:46,992
When we have shuffled off
this mortal coil

380
00:46:47,235 --> 00:46:49,510
Must give us pause:

381
00:46:49,595 --> 00:46:54,271
There's the respect
That makes calamity of so long life;

382
00:46:54,355 --> 00:46:58,428
For who would bear
the whips and scorns of time

383
00:46:58,515 --> 00:47:02,064
The oppressor's wrong
the proud man's contumely

384
00:47:02,155 --> 00:47:04,430
The pangs of despised love

385
00:47:04,515 --> 00:47:08,303
the law's delay
The insolence of office...

386
00:47:10,275 --> 00:47:15,190
- Looks like we do have the old Bard.
- Looks like we do. You're in.

387
00:47:16,555 --> 00:47:18,466
Come on, Foxworth.

388
00:47:26,075 --> 00:47:29,750
The oppressor's wrong
the proud man's contumely

389
00:47:29,835 --> 00:47:33,953
The pangs of despised love
the law's delay

390
00:47:34,195 --> 00:47:36,504
The insolence of office, and the spurns

391
00:47:36,595 --> 00:47:39,393
That patient merit of the unworthy takes

392
00:47:39,475 --> 00:47:45,550
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare bodkin?

393
00:47:45,635 --> 00:47:50,265
Who would fardels bear
To grunt and sweat under weary life...

394
00:47:52,435 --> 00:47:54,505
...of something after death -

395
00:47:54,595 --> 00:47:58,474
The undiscovered country
from whose bourn no traveller returns

396
00:47:58,555 --> 00:48:02,070
puzzles the will and makes us
rather bear those ills we have

397
00:48:02,315 --> 00:48:06,467
Than fly to others that we know not of?

398
00:48:09,835 --> 00:48:12,952
In the second book of "The Republic"

399
00:48:13,195 --> 00:48:17,074
Plato says "What will happen
to the just man

400
00:48:18,275 --> 00:48:20,789
"should he enter this world?"

401
00:48:20,875 --> 00:48:23,787
Well, the just man will be scourged

402
00:48:23,875 --> 00:48:27,311
racked, chained...

403
00:48:27,395 --> 00:48:30,114
...and after every kind of misery...

404
00:48:32,035 --> 00:48:36,506
...he will be crucified on a pole for all to see.

405
00:48:38,675 --> 00:48:40,870
Any questions?

406
00:48:47,395 --> 00:48:49,306
I've got a question.

407
00:48:52,675 --> 00:48:54,586
- Do you mind?
- Sure.

408
00:48:57,515 --> 00:49:03,112
My question. If the just man...
is treated as you say...

409
00:49:05,395 --> 00:49:07,784
...then what's the just response?

410
00:49:11,155 --> 00:49:14,943
Roll over and let evil have its wicked way?

411
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:19,825
- What would you recommend, Major?
- Oh, I'd recommend defiance.

412
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:23,464
Justice for the captors. An eye for an eye.

413
00:49:23,555 --> 00:49:26,274
And what price mercy?

414
00:49:28,475 --> 00:49:32,946
Yeah, mercy. The last bastion
of traitors and cowards.

415
00:49:35,475 --> 00:49:40,788
So you would take a man and crucify him
on a pole for all to see?

416
00:49:41,875 --> 00:49:44,389
I would seek justice.

417
00:49:48,395 --> 00:49:50,306
Any of you?

418
00:50:07,675 --> 00:50:09,313
Sergeant Major?

419
00:50:33,275 --> 00:50:35,072
Heave... heave...

420
00:50:42,075 --> 00:50:45,351
Major Campbell was a natural leader
amongst men.

421
00:50:45,435 --> 00:50:49,508
He seemed to draw them
from all nationalities and groups

422
00:50:49,595 --> 00:50:53,873
and he'd a way with uniting them
in a common cause, HIS cause.

423
00:50:55,115 --> 00:50:57,265
Very good. Two more of us.

424
00:51:10,155 --> 00:51:14,433
The guards change between 5 and 5.30
so we have to be there.

425
00:51:14,515 --> 00:51:18,906
Sorry, Major, are we interrupting
a church service?

426
00:51:26,475 --> 00:51:28,989
So what's the story?

427
00:51:29,235 --> 00:51:32,147
Major, let's say your plan works, right?

428
00:51:33,635 --> 00:51:37,913
You've confiscated the guns
captured the guards

429
00:51:37,995 --> 00:51:40,111
taken over the whole camp.

430
00:51:41,675 --> 00:51:43,905
What then?

431
00:51:43,995 --> 00:51:47,874
You have still nowhere to go.

432
00:51:47,955 --> 00:51:51,027
And when the Nips find out

433
00:51:51,115 --> 00:51:56,633
we'll have a regiment a thousand strong
descend on us with a vengeance.

434
00:51:57,755 --> 00:52:00,394
You can't possibly hope to survive.

435
00:52:01,515 --> 00:52:04,791
Who's talking about survival?

436
00:52:04,875 --> 00:52:07,514
So this is a suicide mission?

437
00:52:12,395 --> 00:52:16,024
So what are you gonna do, eh?
What are you gonna do?

438
00:52:16,275 --> 00:52:19,187
Throw yourself at the mercy of Bushido?

439
00:52:21,275 --> 00:52:25,746
- Aye, that would be suicide.
- Save us the bullshit, Major.

440
00:52:27,275 --> 00:52:29,186
What are they paying you, Yanker?

441
00:52:31,995 --> 00:52:33,951
Huh?

442
00:52:34,035 --> 00:52:36,151
What, he didnae tell you?

443
00:52:39,675 --> 00:52:43,304
Some of his best trades are with the Japs.

444
00:52:45,035 --> 00:52:48,914
How do you think they get
such good medicine?

445
00:52:48,995 --> 00:52:51,065
Ain't that right, Yanker?

446
00:52:51,315 --> 00:52:53,670
Yeah, tell them, Yanker, eh?

447
00:52:53,755 --> 00:52:55,268
Huh?

448
00:52:56,355 --> 00:53:00,064
You are endangering the life
of every man in this camp.

449
00:53:00,315 --> 00:53:02,988
They don't agree with your idea of justice.

450
00:53:03,235 --> 00:53:06,671
So what are you
the voice of the people now, eh?

451
00:53:07,755 --> 00:53:12,067
Or are you just a wee bit too Jap-happy
for your own good?

452
00:53:17,515 --> 00:53:19,585
Ernie...

453
00:53:19,675 --> 00:53:22,587
...we Argylls have got to stick together.

454
00:53:24,555 --> 00:53:28,264
And you know
that's what the Colonel would say.

455
00:53:32,195 --> 00:53:33,992
Good boy.

456
00:53:38,555 --> 00:53:42,594
"Greater love hath no man
than this

457
00:53:42,675 --> 00:53:46,714
"that a man lay down his life...
for his friends.

458
00:53:46,795 --> 00:53:51,823
"You have heard that it was said
that you shall love your neighbour

459
00:53:51,915 --> 00:53:54,429
"and hate your enemy.

460
00:53:56,475 --> 00:53:59,273
"But I say to you...

461
00:53:59,355 --> 00:54:04,713
"...love your enemy...
and pray for those who persecute you.

462
00:54:07,075 --> 00:54:11,546
"For what shall it profit a man
if he gains the whole world...

463
00:54:12,635 --> 00:54:14,546
"...but loses his soul?

464
00:54:19,875 --> 00:54:24,790
"Or what will a man give...
in exchange for his soul?"

465
00:54:34,795 --> 00:54:39,266
You're making a terrible mistake. I can
get you chocolate, whisky, cigarettes...

466
00:54:39,355 --> 00:54:42,074
The Major imagined Reardon a threat.

467
00:54:42,315 --> 00:54:46,991
To him, a man without a sense of duty
loyal to no one but himself

468
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:49,111
is already a traitor.

469
00:55:34,715 --> 00:55:36,945
Please... please!

470
00:55:37,035 --> 00:55:38,946
It's my school!

471
00:55:39,195 --> 00:55:41,311
It's... It's my school!

472
00:55:48,395 --> 00:55:51,865
Major Campbell struck a deal
with the Japs.

473
00:55:51,955 --> 00:55:54,344
I was to be left alone.

474
00:55:54,435 --> 00:55:57,507
In his mind
this was not considered betrayal.

475
00:55:57,595 --> 00:56:00,393
The school had delayed his plans.

476
00:56:00,475 --> 00:56:04,309
Men were changing their minds...
and Dusty had been the catalyst.

477
00:56:39,355 --> 00:56:43,746
This book... teaches to turn the other cheek.

478
00:56:46,995 --> 00:56:49,111
We read these books...

479
00:56:50,395 --> 00:56:54,104
...and we become better slaves
for the Emperor.

480
00:57:41,715 --> 00:57:44,434
He says the book is superstition.

481
00:58:00,635 --> 00:58:05,026
Captain Noguchi says
the railroad progress is too slow.

482
00:58:05,115 --> 00:58:09,472
He received orders from headquarters
requiring us to finish six months earlier

483
00:58:09,555 --> 00:58:11,466
than it was scheduled.

484
00:58:13,595 --> 00:58:16,314
Honourable sir, that's... that...

485
00:58:24,915 --> 00:58:27,031
You are dismissed.

486
00:58:37,915 --> 00:58:39,826
Superstition.

487
00:59:26,275 --> 00:59:29,745
I'm still alive, you Jap bastards!

488
00:59:29,835 --> 00:59:31,746
You can understand that!

489
01:00:20,075 --> 01:00:23,988
They could take away our books
but they couldn't take away

490
01:00:24,075 --> 01:00:26,748
what we had learned in our university.

491
01:00:26,835 --> 01:00:30,305
Dusty led men out of the Death House
to trawl water.

492
01:00:30,395 --> 01:00:35,310
His example of what we were learning
inspired us to work like never before.

493
01:00:42,155 --> 01:00:44,271
And our captors noticed.

494
01:00:52,275 --> 01:00:55,824
As for the Major
we refused to get even with him...

495
01:00:56,955 --> 01:00:59,674
...to pay him back in kind.

496
01:00:59,755 --> 01:01:01,871
It began to eat at him.

497
01:02:21,115 --> 01:02:24,664
Captain Noguchi says
he gives you your books back

498
01:02:24,755 --> 01:02:26,871
for you to keep learning.

499
01:02:44,835 --> 01:02:47,952
Captain Noguchi
graciously gives you these gifts

500
01:02:48,195 --> 01:02:50,504
for being good workers.

501
01:02:55,235 --> 01:02:56,748
What is it?

502
01:03:22,435 --> 01:03:25,108
We're back in business, lads!

503
01:03:29,755 --> 01:03:32,952
- Oi, these are three years old!
- Japanese import laws!

504
01:03:33,195 --> 01:03:36,870
- There's mail in here!
- Let me see it!

505
01:04:00,715 --> 01:04:03,991
From that day on
Yanker never spoke much.

506
01:04:04,075 --> 01:04:06,987
Something had changed inside him.

507
01:04:07,235 --> 01:04:10,545
It was hard to tell
whether it was for the better...

508
01:04:11,595 --> 01:04:14,234
or the worse.

509
01:04:30,835 --> 01:04:33,952
Chip chip, muckers.
Graduation ceremonies are coming.

510
01:04:34,195 --> 01:04:37,107
I want a tiptop performance out of you.

511
01:04:38,195 --> 01:04:39,708
Continue.

512
01:04:53,315 --> 01:04:56,034
Gentlemen... let's continue.

513
01:05:03,395 --> 01:05:07,070
To do our country loss; and if to live
The fewer men

514
01:05:07,315 --> 01:05:09,385
the greater share of honour.

515
01:05:09,475 --> 01:05:11,943
He that shall live, and see old age

516
01:05:12,035 --> 01:05:14,947
Then shall he strip his sleeve
and show his scars

517
01:05:15,195 --> 01:05:17,914
And say
"These wounds I had on Crispin's day."

518
01:05:30,195 --> 01:05:32,948
MEAT! MEAT!

519
01:05:48,315 --> 01:05:50,704
BEEF!

520
01:06:06,115 --> 01:06:08,390
Yanker decided to join us.

521
01:06:08,475 --> 01:06:11,945
A bit late in the term
but eager to catch up.

522
01:06:27,435 --> 01:06:29,949
You're a good teacher.

523
01:06:31,595 --> 01:06:36,988
- What's your name?
- I'm Nagase. Takashi Nagase.

524
01:06:38,315 --> 01:06:40,226
Hello, Takashi.

525
01:06:41,795 --> 01:06:43,308
I'm Ernest.

526
01:06:44,595 --> 01:06:48,065
I've actually been wondering

527
01:06:48,155 --> 01:06:51,465
where you learnt such excellent English.

528
01:06:52,555 --> 01:06:55,627
I was educated at Cambridge.

529
01:06:55,715 --> 01:07:01,904
To be a good translator, I thought
one must understand the culture.

530
01:07:03,195 --> 01:07:05,311
What do you think of the British?

531
01:07:06,395 --> 01:07:09,307
I think there is a lot to learn from them.

532
01:07:13,675 --> 01:07:17,350
And can I ask you, Honourable Takashi

533
01:07:17,435 --> 01:07:20,632
what you are doing here in this camp?

534
01:07:22,395 --> 01:07:25,751
I... I was classified low physical fitness.

535
01:07:28,755 --> 01:07:34,034
A prisoner of war camp is not
honourable place for Japanese soldier.

536
01:07:34,115 --> 01:07:36,424
It is more like a punishment.

537
01:07:38,435 --> 01:07:41,632
Shame for his entire family.

538
01:07:42,275 --> 01:07:45,984
Well, what about... Sergeant lto?

539
01:07:47,235 --> 01:07:49,749
Surely he's the consummate soldier.

540
01:07:51,235 --> 01:07:55,911
He accepted the blame for
the bad decision his superior made.

541
01:07:55,995 --> 01:08:00,466
It resulted in the deaths
of most of his squad.

542
01:08:00,555 --> 01:08:03,706
- So that's why he's so bitter?
- No.

543
01:08:03,795 --> 01:08:09,108
In Bushido, it is an honour to be punished
in place of your superior.

544
01:08:10,355 --> 01:08:13,631
According to our lmperial Rescript

545
01:08:13,715 --> 01:08:16,468
in the Emperor's army...

546
01:08:16,555 --> 01:08:20,309
...a single life... weighs less than a feather.

547
01:08:27,435 --> 01:08:31,667
No matter how good things got
we were still slaves building a railway

548
01:08:32,515 --> 01:08:35,029
being starved to death.

549
01:08:35,275 --> 01:08:39,188
Thousands of us in a dozen
other prison camps, as well.

550
01:08:41,555 --> 01:08:43,625
And as if that weren't enough

551
01:08:43,715 --> 01:08:49,711
the Major and his dangerous plan seemed
ready to explode at any moment.

552
01:09:19,675 --> 01:09:25,989
We realised we weren't the only slaves
being used in the name of the Emperor.

553
01:09:26,075 --> 01:09:30,785
They called them "comfort women"
spoils of Japanese conquest.

554
01:09:51,995 --> 01:09:56,432
A conquest whose original intent
was to purify the spirit.

555
01:09:56,515 --> 01:10:00,349
The true warrior deems his sword
the soul of Bushido.

556
01:10:01,435 --> 01:10:03,903
The key of heaven and hell

557
01:10:03,995 --> 01:10:09,353
a symbol of what he carries
in his heart - loyalty and honour.

558
01:10:43,395 --> 01:10:45,955
We finished the railroad in October 1943.

559
01:10:47,275 --> 01:10:50,347
Six months ahead of schedule.

560
01:10:50,435 --> 01:10:52,949
A real cause for celebration (l)

561
01:10:54,115 --> 01:10:56,993
Like we were told in the beginning

562
01:10:57,075 --> 01:11:00,033
they built it over the white man's body.

563
01:11:00,275 --> 01:11:04,791
Those damned yellow Nips!
Acting as if they built the bloody thing!

564
01:11:06,955 --> 01:11:09,310
Bloody railway of death.

565
01:11:11,235 --> 01:11:13,954
That's the least of our concerns.

566
01:11:15,355 --> 01:11:17,266
What do you mean?

567
01:11:19,515 --> 01:11:24,635
We've built the railway.
They don't need us any more.

568
01:12:07,555 --> 01:12:12,265
Those of you to the right of me
will be transferred to another camp.

569
01:12:15,555 --> 01:12:19,753
It seemed like the final hindrance
to the Major's plan.

570
01:12:19,835 --> 01:12:25,353
Half of his men were split apart that day.
Sent away, never seen again.

571
01:12:53,635 --> 01:12:56,433
Attention, all prisoners.

572
01:12:56,515 --> 01:12:59,393
There is a shovel missing
from the tool shed.

573
01:13:00,675 --> 01:13:04,384
The one who has taken the shovel
return it now.

574
01:13:18,835 --> 01:13:23,704
If the shovel is not returned
the entire camp will suffer punishment.

575
01:13:23,795 --> 01:13:26,263
You will respect us.

576
01:15:17,755 --> 01:15:19,871
The shovel was found.

577
01:15:22,995 --> 01:15:26,544
There was a miscount
a simple bloody miscount.

578
01:15:57,355 --> 01:16:00,233
You are dismissed.

579
01:16:06,115 --> 01:16:11,030
What would compel a man, once so selfish
to sacrifice himself for others?

580
01:16:12,075 --> 01:16:13,986
Boys...

581
01:16:14,235 --> 01:16:18,547
...I can't feel my legs... I can't feel my legs.

582
01:16:27,115 --> 01:16:29,675
Tonight's the graduation ceremony.

583
01:16:31,395 --> 01:16:33,704
Japs have all been invited.

584
01:16:35,355 --> 01:16:39,746
That means a slim chance of anyone
being left in the guard house.

585
01:16:39,835 --> 01:16:44,306
You're not still going through with this?
There's only six of us.

586
01:16:44,395 --> 01:16:48,274
We lost six men.
It was near impossible with twelve.

587
01:16:48,355 --> 01:16:51,825
God knows, we haven't got
a chance with six!

588
01:16:51,915 --> 01:16:55,794
- Now you're privy to the mind of God?
- Well, no, but...

589
01:16:55,875 --> 01:16:59,185
I will not tolerate double-mindedness.

590
01:17:02,795 --> 01:17:04,706
I'm staying.

591
01:17:10,755 --> 01:17:12,871
Well, that leaves five.

592
01:17:27,675 --> 01:17:30,792
Don't worry, boys. You don't worry, boys.

593
01:17:32,995 --> 01:17:34,906
We'll have our justice.

594
01:17:42,555 --> 01:17:45,388
Major Charlie Fraser, Language.

595
01:17:49,475 --> 01:17:53,388
Sergeant Bingo Johnson, Philosophy.

596
01:17:58,555 --> 01:18:00,830
Last, but by no means least

597
01:18:00,915 --> 01:18:04,430
Private Wallace Hamilton, Ethics.

598
01:18:08,755 --> 01:18:11,064
Gentlemen...

599
01:18:11,315 --> 01:18:13,385
...the graduates...

600
01:18:13,475 --> 01:18:16,592
...from our jungle university.

601
01:18:37,155 --> 01:18:40,067
Well, let the festivities begin!

602
01:18:51,755 --> 01:18:55,634
The music we heard that night
was less than perfect.

603
01:18:55,715 --> 01:19:00,266
In fact, it was bloody terrible
but we didn't care.

604
01:19:00,355 --> 01:19:03,427
In our hearts, we heard what it could be.

605
01:19:03,515 --> 01:19:06,791
We heard the true spirit of the music.
Pure freedom.

606
01:20:25,515 --> 01:20:30,953
If we are mark'd to die, we are enow
To do our country loss...

607
01:20:35,915 --> 01:20:38,827
Guard, guard! Down, down!

608
01:20:47,955 --> 01:20:50,867
- Glad you made it!
- The bloody music was awful!

609
01:20:51,795 --> 01:20:55,868
He that shall see this day
and live t'old age

610
01:20:55,955 --> 01:20:59,584
Shall stand a-tiptoe
when this day is named

611
01:20:59,675 --> 01:21:04,305
Then shall he strip his sleeve
and show his scars, and say...

612
01:21:08,355 --> 01:21:10,869
- There's no ammo in this thing!
- Find it!

613
01:21:16,995 --> 01:21:19,589
Shh, shh, shh!

614
01:21:22,715 --> 01:21:25,787
It's a B24. It's liberators!

615
01:21:25,875 --> 01:21:30,426
- How can you be sure?
- It's unmistakable, man! Sweet music!

616
01:21:30,515 --> 01:21:31,834
Liberators!

617
01:21:32,915 --> 01:21:34,985
Allied aircraft.

618
01:21:35,075 --> 01:21:39,273
They couldn't see us
but we could sure hear them.

619
01:21:39,355 --> 01:21:41,311
We knew the war was turning.

620
01:22:02,355 --> 01:22:05,233
- Speedo, speedo!
- Speedo, my arse!

621
01:23:01,155 --> 01:23:06,309
Attention, prisoners. These men are
guilty of murdering two guards

622
01:23:06,395 --> 01:23:10,547
who represent the lmperial Army
and of committing insurrection.

623
01:23:10,635 --> 01:23:15,231
They have violated the mercy
of the Emperor...

624
01:23:19,955 --> 01:23:24,710
Honourable Sergeant lto will now dispense
the prescribed and just punishment.

625
01:24:06,795 --> 01:24:08,069
Major?

626
01:24:46,555 --> 01:24:47,954
Bastard.

627
01:24:51,835 --> 01:24:53,314
Ito.

628
01:25:11,035 --> 01:25:12,354
Dusty?

629
01:25:14,795 --> 01:25:18,424
What are you saying?
What are you saying?

630
01:25:22,395 --> 01:25:24,431
Dusty?

631
01:25:32,035 --> 01:25:33,753
No!

632
01:25:35,715 --> 01:25:37,831
No... no!

633
01:25:39,035 --> 01:25:41,833
NO! DUSTY!

634
01:26:02,835 --> 01:26:06,384
Major! Major, what did he say?

635
01:26:06,475 --> 01:26:08,670
Major, please, what did Dusty say?

636
01:26:09,635 --> 01:26:11,353
Major!

637
01:26:16,675 --> 01:26:18,586
My boys!

638
01:26:23,355 --> 01:26:24,868
Sorry.

639
01:26:51,075 --> 01:26:54,431
No, no, no! No! No!

640
01:27:13,915 --> 01:27:16,270
Superstition.

641
01:27:24,595 --> 01:27:26,506
Do it!

642
01:28:57,195 --> 01:28:59,868
Dusty!

643
01:29:01,675 --> 01:29:03,984
Dusty!

644
01:29:05,555 --> 01:29:07,307
Dusty!

645
01:29:52,555 --> 01:29:54,750
When Dusty Miller died

646
01:29:54,835 --> 01:29:58,350
something in the hearts and minds
of every man died.

647
01:29:58,435 --> 01:30:02,508
What we had somehow managed
to hold onto for years of survival

648
01:30:02,595 --> 01:30:05,268
now seemed utterly meaningless

649
01:30:05,355 --> 01:30:09,268
like God himself was playing
a cruel joke on us all.

650
01:30:11,195 --> 01:30:15,586
Until I remembered Dusty's words
so very long ago.

651
01:30:15,675 --> 01:30:19,554
"Except a corn of wheat fall
into the ground and die

652
01:30:19,635 --> 01:30:21,944
"it abideth alone.

653
01:30:22,195 --> 01:30:24,072
"But if it die

654
01:30:24,315 --> 01:30:26,829
"it bringeth forth much fruit."

655
01:31:25,235 --> 01:31:28,784
I never found out
what Dusty said to lto that day

656
01:31:28,875 --> 01:31:32,834
but I knew I had witnessed
the power of forgiveness.

657
01:31:47,635 --> 01:31:51,913
Attention. Soon all inferior races

658
01:31:51,995 --> 01:31:55,704
will bow before the Emperor
and the Knights of the Bushido.

659
01:31:59,235 --> 01:32:03,433
When we heard the planes again
we thought our deliverance had arrived.

660
01:32:10,755 --> 01:32:15,829
- Then it happened...
- Hail, Knights of Bullshitto!

661
01:32:15,915 --> 01:32:18,952
Our own allies thought we were the enemy.

662
01:32:54,315 --> 01:32:57,034
I'm fine! Help the other men!

663
01:33:00,555 --> 01:33:03,023
Help me! Help me!

664
01:33:03,115 --> 01:33:05,424
Help me! Help me, Ernie!

665
01:33:05,515 --> 01:33:09,030
Just don't look at it, man!
It's nothing, it's nothing!

666
01:33:09,115 --> 01:33:11,993
They thought we was Nips, Ernie!

667
01:33:12,075 --> 01:33:15,988
I almost made it!
I got killed by my own side, Ernie!

668
01:33:16,235 --> 01:33:20,626
- You're not killed, you're with me!
- They thought we was Nips!

669
01:33:20,715 --> 01:33:25,994
Don't leave me, man! Don't you leave me
man! Don't you leave me, man!

670
01:33:26,235 --> 01:33:31,753
Stay with me, man! Stay with me, man!
Stay with me! Stay with me, man! No!

671
01:33:47,195 --> 01:33:50,312
Get up! Get fucking up!

672
01:34:11,355 --> 01:34:14,074
An enemy location was also hit nearby.

673
01:34:14,155 --> 01:34:17,431
The wounded had abandoned
their posts looking for help.

674
01:34:17,515 --> 01:34:22,987
Their arrival at our camp would
compel us to make the most important
decision of our lives.

675
01:34:23,075 --> 01:34:26,067
A decision that would defy
the Bushido code

676
01:34:26,315 --> 01:34:28,146
of honour and shame.

677
01:35:42,835 --> 01:35:46,066
No goodka! No goodka!

678
01:35:52,955 --> 01:35:54,866
Ernest.

679
01:35:59,035 --> 01:36:03,870
Captain Gordon, I forbid you
to give comfort and aid to the enemy.

680
01:36:04,955 --> 01:36:07,867
Major... those...

681
01:36:08,955 --> 01:36:12,868
...are wounded, dying human beings.

682
01:36:15,475 --> 01:36:18,353
They're no harm to us.

683
01:36:18,435 --> 01:36:21,108
Ernie, get back to your own men.

684
01:36:42,795 --> 01:36:44,911
Can someone get me some water?

685
01:36:48,395 --> 01:36:51,148
Could someone please get me
some water?

686
01:38:40,475 --> 01:38:44,354
We were left alone
by our captors. Nowhere to go.

687
01:38:44,435 --> 01:38:46,505
Nothing to do.

688
01:38:46,595 --> 01:38:48,825
An uncertain future

689
01:38:49,195 --> 01:38:55,031
with only a makeshift radio left behind
hoping for any word from the outside.

690
01:39:21,155 --> 01:39:23,271
"To all Allied prisoners of war.

691
01:39:23,595 --> 01:39:28,032
"The Japanese forces
have surrendered unconditionally

692
01:39:28,115 --> 01:39:30,106
"and the war is over."

693
01:39:50,235 --> 01:39:53,307
For he today that sheds his blood with me

694
01:39:53,395 --> 01:39:55,511
Shall be my brother;

695
01:39:59,155 --> 01:40:01,623
Be he ne'er so vile

696
01:40:01,715 --> 01:40:04,627
This day shall gentle his condition.

697
01:40:08,475 --> 01:40:11,990
From this day
to the ending of the world

698
01:40:12,075 --> 01:40:14,066
But we in it shall be remembered -

699
01:40:14,315 --> 01:40:18,593
We few... we happy few

700
01:40:18,675 --> 01:40:20,984
We band of brothers.

701
01:41:13,995 --> 01:41:15,906
Where are the guards?

702
01:41:18,035 --> 01:41:19,946
Th-They left.

703
01:41:20,195 --> 01:41:23,312
Fled into the jungle... from us.

704
01:41:24,755 --> 01:41:26,666
Which direction?

705
01:41:29,235 --> 01:41:31,146
I've no idea.

706
01:41:55,195 --> 01:41:59,074
You're a man of true principle
and devotion.

707
01:42:00,635 --> 01:42:02,705
And, you know...

708
01:42:04,035 --> 01:42:07,072
I wanna be just like you, just like you.

709
01:42:27,835 --> 01:42:30,030
Major Campbell.

710
01:42:30,115 --> 01:42:31,833
Hey, Ernie...

711
01:42:32,915 --> 01:42:35,987
...you're just in time.

712
01:42:36,075 --> 01:42:37,986
You're making a mistake.

713
01:42:39,475 --> 01:42:43,184
No... l'm making justice, man.

714
01:42:49,075 --> 01:42:52,351
Don't you think... I want this?

715
01:42:53,715 --> 01:42:56,468
Eh? Eh?

716
01:42:57,755 --> 01:43:01,953
We all deserve to see him suffer

717
01:43:02,035 --> 01:43:03,991
but this is not right.

718
01:43:14,035 --> 01:43:16,265
Mm?

719
01:43:16,355 --> 01:43:17,583
Aye.

720
01:43:25,195 --> 01:43:28,471
You stupid... stupid wee boy!

721
01:43:29,555 --> 01:43:31,466
Stupid wee boy!

722
01:43:41,555 --> 01:43:43,511
God forgive me!

723
01:43:46,515 --> 01:43:48,426
Oh, God forgive me!

724
01:43:49,875 --> 01:43:51,991
Oh, God forgive me, son!

725
01:43:54,715 --> 01:43:56,626
Forgive me, son.

726
01:44:03,715 --> 01:44:05,626
No!

727
01:44:18,915 --> 01:44:20,667
No!

728
01:44:20,755 --> 01:44:25,954
What is the consequence of a single life
weighing less than a feather?

729
01:44:29,835 --> 01:44:32,827
Bastard! Bastard!

730
01:44:36,435 --> 01:44:39,347
What is the final destination of hatred?

731
01:44:53,075 --> 01:44:58,468
When you look in the eyes
of the enemy and you see yourself...

732
01:44:58,555 --> 01:45:00,466
Come here.

733
01:45:03,035 --> 01:45:04,946
Come here!

734
01:45:07,715 --> 01:45:10,104
...at what price mercy?

735
01:45:25,315 --> 01:45:27,875
Who is my neighbour?

736
01:45:27,955 --> 01:45:34,906
How many times shall I forgive my brother?
What does it mean to love one's enemies?

737
01:45:34,995 --> 01:45:38,704
What can a man give
in exchange for his soul?

738
01:45:40,195 --> 01:45:44,108
These are the questions that I faced
in my prison camp.

739
01:45:45,355 --> 01:45:47,107
The answers... changed my life for ever.

740
