Yeah. Over the years.

intimate than that.

And her lighting has this
ethereal quality to it.

206

It's kind of like
a subverted realism.

you may want to consider her...

00:38:30,007 --> 00:38:33,807
Dominique Peugeot
was the receptionist
at <i>Interview.</i>

460
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:38,415
Yeah, but she's
the executive editor
at <i>Frame</i> now.

461
00:38:38,549 --> 00:38:42,383
She really wants
you to do a piece...
probably the cover.

462
00:38:43,754 --> 00:38:46,780
Wow.
She really climbed up.

463
00:38:46,891 --> 00:38:49,485
This is what I was talking
to you about the other night.

464
00:38:49,627 --> 00:38:51,720
They really want
to meet with you.

465
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:54,992
They want to take
you to lunch on Thursday.

466
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:01,502
I appreciate it,
but I don't do that anymore.

467
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:05,072
Don't do what?

468
00:39:05,209 --> 00:39:08,645
Industry work.

469
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:11,111
Well, it's not industry work.
I mean,

470
00:39:11,248 --> 00:39:15,116
it's not like an assignment...
you can do whatever you want.

471
00:39:16,821 --> 00:39:19,449
Can I take pictures of you?

472
00:39:19,623 --> 00:39:22,285
Right now?

473
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,621
[Laughing]
No.

474
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:27,960
I feel like shit right now.
I'm kinda wrecked.

475
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:31,133
You look really sexy, actually.

476
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,973
I stopped working commercially
10 years ago.

477
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:43,410
It was kind of a mental-health decision.

478
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:48,246
Actually, no.
It wasn't a decision.

479
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:51,651
I just made it impossible
for myself to continue.

480
00:39:51,756 --> 00:39:56,921
Impossible? How?
I mean, what did you do?

481
00:39:57,995 --> 00:40:00,725
I stopped showing up.

482
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:04,664
For what?
I mean, why?

483
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:09,135
I don't know why, exactly.
I mean, why do people fuck up?

484
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,800
It just seemed sort of punk at the time.

485
00:40:11,942 --> 00:40:13,807
I don't understand
that exactly.

486
00:40:13,978 --> 00:40:17,277
I don't really know how
to explain it to you, Syd.

487
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:21,249
There just stopped being a line
between me and work.

488
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:24,820
People were glomming on
to something I was doing then,

489
00:40:24,955 --> 00:40:28,220
and I just... got trapped.

490
00:40:28,325 --> 00:40:33,729
I mean, I loved the attention
but I just couldn't handle the impact.

491
00:40:35,332 --> 00:40:39,098
I felt sort of pigeonholed...

492
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:43,570
um, sort of like
I couldn't breathe anymore.

493
00:40:43,674 --> 00:40:46,199
Does that make sense?
<i>Yeah.</i>

494
00:40:51,081 --> 00:40:54,380
The people at <i>Frame</i> think
you're an amazing photographer.

495
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:58,353
<i>Theyjust want</i>
<i>to see you work again.</i>

496
00:40:58,522 --> 00:41:01,082
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>that they want to trap you.</i>

497
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:03,693
I think they want
to support you.

498

<i>[Dominique]</i>
<i>So, it's just this one woman</i>
<i>under water and your mother?</i>

499
00:41:16,073 --> 00:41:18,564
Right.

500
00:41:18,709 --> 00:41:21,143
That's what I'm doing now.

501
00:41:21,278 --> 00:41:23,872
And who's the woman?

502
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:28,144
Greta Krauss.
She's a German actress.

503
00:41:28,252 --> 00:41:30,914
I've actually done
a lot of work with her.

504
00:41:31,088 --> 00:41:32,919
You done with that one?

505
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:34,921
Just a second.

Right.

<i>[Harry]</i>
<i>I'm sorry, are they portraits?</i>

509
00:41:46,904 --> 00:41:49,702
Right.
Underwater portraits.

510
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:52,365
I have to say, Lucy,
I love your older work.

511
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,910
I find the realism incredibly honest.

512
00:41:55,045 --> 00:41:59,812
Lucy, I think your work
has a certain allure right now...

513
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:03,112
a cultural currency
that we'd like to explore with you.

514
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:07,088
- A cultural currency.
- A certain cachet.

515
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:09,692
<i>If I can interrupt, Lucy,</i>
<i>I think Dominique is saying...</i>

516
00:42:09,827 --> 00:42:12,295
that the public can appreciate
the rigor of your work now...

517
00:42:12,429 --> 00:42:14,761
the intimacy and desolation
of your subjects.

518
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:17,129
Lucy, we'd like to offer you
the fall cover.

519
00:42:17,234 --> 00:42:18,997
<i>We think the best way</i>
<i>to bridge the gap...</i>

520
00:42:19,169 --> 00:42:21,467
Well, to reintroduce...

521
00:42:21,572 --> 00:42:25,099
Right, reintroduce you publicly,
is to revisit some of your older themes.

522
00:42:25,242 --> 00:42:28,143
<i>We are thinking of an essay,</i>
<i>Lucy, rather free-form...</i>

523
00:42:28,312 --> 00:42:31,543
sort of an examination
of your friends and your life.

524
00:42:31,649 --> 00:42:34,015
You'd like me to examine my life.

525
00:42:34,151 --> 00:42:37,951
<i>[Harry]</i>
<i>We'd like you to go back</i>
<i>to the place where you left off.</i>

<i>I know deadlines are</i>
<i>a horrible sort of nuisance...</i>

527
00:42:42,326 --> 00:42:45,159
but we would need to
move on this immediately.

528
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:49,629
Right. Well, let me think about it.

529
00:42:49,767 --> 00:42:51,667
We're usually not solicitous,
Lucy.

530
00:42:51,835 --> 00:42:54,201
I mean, we receive thousands
of submissions a year.

531
00:42:54,338 --> 00:42:58,604
But we'll put some very promising
photographers on hold for you.

532
00:42:58,709 --> 00:43:02,304
You know, it's flattering.

533
00:43:02,479 --> 00:43:05,937
And it sounds interesting.

534
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:11,715
Um, but, I really have to see
about my other obligations.

535
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:14,016
Well, we would need
a commitment from you today.

536
00:43:14,124 --> 00:43:16,388
Otherwise, we'd have to give
the space to another photographer.

537
00:43:16,493 --> 00:43:19,189
<i>It's just that close,</i>
<i>unfortunately.</i>

538
00:43:19,363 --> 00:43:21,354
It's really yours to define, Lucy.

539
00:43:21,465 --> 00:43:24,992
I mean, I hope we've
impressed that on you.

540
00:43:25,135 --> 00:43:26,898
<i>This is not an assignment.</i>

541
00:43:27,071 --> 00:43:29,539
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>we'll help you shape it</i>
<i>and select images.</i>

<i>Okay.</i>

I want to work with Syd on it.

546
00:43:42,653 --> 00:43:44,951
Brilliant.
Syd's in the office every day.

547
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:48,820
She's involved
in all of our projects.

548
00:43:48,993 --> 00:43:52,224
I mean, she can certainly
give some feedback.

549
00:43:52,329 --> 00:43:54,092
We always encourage that from her.

550

<i>No, I want Syd to be my editor.</i>

551
00:44:04,274 --> 00:44:07,937
So, did you get a raise?

552
00:44:08,112 --> 00:44:10,876
It's not about a raise.

553
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:15,774
What do you think
of this shirt?
Is it too tight?

554
00:44:15,919 --> 00:44:17,750
No.
No?

555
00:44:17,921 --> 00:44:22,483
I think it's sexy.
How 'bout this color?
You like the color?

556
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:26,221
I like it.
Yeah?

557
00:44:26,397 --> 00:44:30,424
I don't want to
stay too long, okay?
Okay.

00:44:30,534 --> 00:44:32,593
Really.
Yeah.

559
00:44:41,712 --> 00:44:45,079
Syd mentioned to me
that you were retired?

560
00:44:45,215 --> 00:44:48,082
Yeah, I stopped working
for a few years.

561
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:50,277
What, um...

562
00:44:50,387 --> 00:44:53,288
What made you decide
to get started again?

I don't know. It just seemed
like the right thing to do.

01:19:53,088 --> 01:19:54,953
Do you know what I'm saying?

928
01:19:56,792 --> 01:19:59,158
I have to change
the situation.

929
01:19:59,294 --> 01:20:01,353
I don't want
to wait anymore.

930
01:20:01,463 --> 01:20:03,931
I mean, I can't.

931
01:20:07,102 --> 01:20:09,570
These are for you.
They're of our weekend.

932
01:20:11,907 --> 01:20:13,738
Thanks.

933
01:20:23,318 --> 01:20:25,377
I want you to use them.

934
01:20:28,990 --> 01:20:31,220
What do you mean
you want me to use them?

935
01:20:31,326 --> 01:20:35,456
I'm in them.
I'm in all of them.

936
01:20:35,564 --> 01:20:40,627
Is that too hard for you?
No, no. It's fine.
I'm just naked in them.

937
01:20:44,506 --> 01:20:47,270
<i>Well, they wanted me</i>
<i>to examine my life, right?</i>
Yeah.

938
01:20:48,777 --> 01:20:52,975
I mean, this is it.
It's about you right now.

939
01:20:56,051 --> 01:20:58,713
I'm thinking
about you.

940
01:21:04,526 --> 01:21:06,892
Anyway, you look gorgeous.

941
01:21:13,535 --> 01:21:15,799
What about
the pictures of Greta?

942
01:21:16,905 --> 01:21:20,432
I mean,
those are beautiful images.

943
01:21:20,575 --> 01:21:22,736
That's what you
were doing before.

944
01:21:26,014 --> 01:21:28,505
That's what you want?

945
01:21:33,021 --> 01:21:35,182
These are really beautiful.

946
01:21:37,993 --> 01:21:40,120
This one would make
a wonderful cover.

947
01:21:47,002 --> 01:21:49,436
This would be better.

948
01:21:54,542 --> 01:21:57,841
I really had an instinct
about this.

949
01:21:57,946 --> 01:21:59,709
How did I know
she was gonna do this?

950
01:21:59,915 --> 01:22:01,780
I thought we were very direct with her.

951
01:22:01,950 --> 01:22:03,781
I literally spelled it out.

952
01:22:03,952 --> 01:22:06,512
There's absolutely
no context here.

953
01:22:06,655 --> 01:22:09,783
Nothing.
It's completely flat.

954
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:14,191
This is a nightmare.

955
01:22:14,362 --> 01:22:16,455
She waited till the last fucking minute,
and this is what we get.

956
01:22:16,564 --> 01:22:18,759
These are
beautiful images.

957
01:22:18,867 --> 01:22:22,098
I mean, the subject is different,
but the quality of the work is...

958
01:22:22,203 --> 01:22:25,798
Syd, Lucy Berliner has been
invisible for ten years.

959
01:22:25,941 --> 01:22:28,808
The public has a five-year memory,
and that's it.

960
01:22:28,977 --> 01:22:32,037
Syd, if a best-selling crime writer
disappeared for ten years...

961
01:22:32,147 --> 01:22:34,775
and came back peddling love poems,
how do you think he would do?

962
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:37,748
Really well,
probably.
It's a business, Syd.

963
01:22:37,953 --> 01:22:39,784
I don't want to do it.

964
01:22:39,955 --> 01:22:41,684
I'm calling Dieter Shulte.

965
01:22:41,856 --> 01:22:45,451
You can't do that, Dominique.
You had an arrangement with Lucy.

966
01:22:47,195 --> 01:22:49,595
I have every right to do that.

967
01:22:51,399 --> 01:22:55,267
I'll see you at my office.
Call Dieter Shulte.

968
01:22:55,437 --> 01:22:59,464
[Sighs Deeply]
Fuck.

969
01:23:35,377 --> 01:23:37,868
I need to talk to you
about Lucy Berliner.

970
01:23:38,013 --> 01:23:40,140
Let's just move forward, Syd.

971
01:23:44,352 --> 01:23:46,183
I want you to look
at these pictures.

972
01:23:46,354 --> 01:23:48,686
I think that they're more
of what you wanted.

973
01:23:48,823 --> 01:23:51,348
<i>Syd, we're practically at press.</i>

974
01:23:51,493 --> 01:23:53,620
Look, I realize
that this is late,

975
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:56,322
but this is her piece...
this is what she wanted to use.

976
01:23:56,498 --> 01:24:00,059
I would like you to
at least consider it.

977
01:24:15,717 --> 01:24:17,844
Why didn't you bring these before?

978
01:24:17,952 --> 01:24:20,853
I didn't think
it was appropriate.

979
01:24:23,158 --> 01:24:25,251
Did you stage these?

980
01:24:26,294 --> 01:24:27,784
No.

981
01:24:33,368 --> 01:24:37,930
I mean, is this some kind of critique?
You're her editor.

982
01:24:38,073 --> 01:24:41,372
<i>No, it's not a critique,</i>
<i>it's just what happened.</i>

983
01:24:41,476 --> 01:24:43,774
<i>It's just what happened?</i>

984
01:24:43,878 --> 01:24:48,611
Well, I didn't realize that
she wanted to use these
when she shot them.

985
01:24:49,784 --> 01:24:51,684
I'm confused, Syd.

986
01:24:53,521 --> 01:24:56,786
- Are you her sitter?
- No, I'm not her sitter...

987
01:24:56,891 --> 01:24:59,451
not formally.

988
01:24:59,594 --> 01:25:03,792
I mean,
no, I'm not in general.

989
01:25:05,366 --> 01:25:07,266
Are you her lover?

990
01:25:11,339 --> 01:25:13,239
Yeah.

991
01:25:31,759 --> 01:25:34,626
Joan's gonna keep score
and we're gonna start over.

992
01:25:34,796 --> 01:25:37,390
Joan's gonna keep score?
I want to keep score.

One of us has to go,

That's not what

I want you to keep
your account.

I don't want your money.

Well, I'm not just
gonna abandon you, G.
I wouldn't do that.

I mean, you just kicked me out,
didn't you?

1011
01:27:42,890 --> 01:27:46,417
What am I supposed to do now?
Just get on a plane? Just go back?

No, you don't have to go back.
I understand... your life is here.

No, it's not.
I don't have a life here.

I came here to be with you,
