1
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:44,346
These few years I keep having the same dream.

2
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,949
I'm struggling in the water.

3
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:51,147
It's so cold.

4
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:56,089
But when I'm about to drown

5
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,531
an arm reaches to me

6
00:02:02,822 --> 00:02:04,267
and pulls me up.

7
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:09,432
But I can never see who he is.

8
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:13,411
I only feel the arm and its power.

9
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:16,006
Somehow it feels close to my heart.

10
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:21,012
I need to know who he is

11
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:48,346
"In the 100 years of the 20th Century,"

12
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:51,245
about 3-5 hundred million people
have died of smallpox.

13
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:53,511
Now with the discovery of
the cowpox vaccine,"

14
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:58,013
people have finally found a way to
resist the harm smallpox has caused humankind.

15
00:02:58,278 --> 00:02:59,882
"On May 8, 1980,"

16
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,254
the International Health
Organization has said

17
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:04,226
Humans are now immune from smallpox.

18
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:06,121
This is not true.

19
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:08,926
The smallpox virus
has not been eradicated.

20
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:12,069
There are two places on earth
that still hold samples of the virus.

21
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:15,138
"One of the virus specialists
has stolen one of the virus samples,"

22
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:16,901
then spent 9 years to mutate the genes

23
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:19,408
in an attempt to create
a lethal biological weapon.

24
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:21,978
His name is Kenner Osama Muhammad.

25
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:23,945
That is the one we will be escorting.

26
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:27,316
This is our mission...
the target of this operation.

27
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:30,854
"They have 5 cars,
bookended by military vehicles."

28
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,287
This is our first point of attack.

29
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:34,050
There are other ambush points.

30
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:35,888
This car will be blown up here.

31
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:38,483
We will then immediately transfer.

32
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:40,464
Leave nothing behind.

33
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,026
Understand?

34
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:44,126
"The American Army caught him
a week ago,"

35
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,566
claiming that he destroyed all
the mutated samples.

36
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,405
"But when Kenner came back to
give his statement,"

37
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:50,468
"he said he did not destroy
all of them,"

38
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:51,975
but had kept only one.

39
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:56,508
That one is the new genre of smallpox
that cannot be prevented by the cowpox vaccine.

40
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:59,984
"He is holding it hostage, demanding
that we escort and protect him"

41
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:03,452
and his family safely back to Norway
before he will hand it over.

42
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:04,817
"I want you guys to be sharp,"

43
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:06,580
know what you're doing and be safe.

44
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:18,927
"Ice, look after them."

45
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:19,935
"Yes, sir."

46
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:06,877
"Base, confidential documents
have been found here."

47
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:17,512
Agent Sean Wong from the IDC'?

48
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,351
This is Transport Team One.

49
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:21,858
Agent Sean Wong from the IDC'?

50
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:24,026
We are the Jordanian Police.

51
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,197
Your caravan may be attacked

52
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,021
Ice. . . Ice

53
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,823
This is Agent Sean Wong of the IDC.

54
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:03,094
We are under attack. Do you read'?

55
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:05,066
"Over, I need back up now!"

56
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:11,236
Do you copy'? Over'? I need back up now!

57
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:44,169
Ram through it! Ram through it!

58
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:06,289
Go back! Go back!

59
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:35,250
"Car 3, Car 4, anyone copy 7"

60
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:40,222
Get out the car!

61
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:41,931
Go! Go... Go!

62
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:44,398
Out the car! Out the car!

63
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:53,104
Ross, protect Kenn
Come here."

64
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,837
Watch for snipers!

65
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:59,573
Car 3 report casualties.
Car 3 do you copy'?

66
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:02,447
"Ross, go check."

67
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,081
"Jon, cover! Jon!"

68
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:22,972
Ice'? Are you okay'?

69
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,068
I'm fine.

70
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,504
Are you okay'?

71
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,477
"Ice, nine o'clock!"

72
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:40,217
"Paka, cover me!"

73
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:45,328
Go! Go! Go!

74
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:49,162
Are you okay'?

75
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:50,199
Yes

76
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,376
"Ice, move!"

77
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:45,015
RPG!

78
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,930
We're done here. Retreat...

79
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,431
Cover me.

80
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:06,139
Go. Go.

81
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:07,973
Exit door! Exit door!

82
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:11,146
Go! Go! Go!

83
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:12,375
Take the girl!

84
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:13,949
That's it. Come here.

85
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:55,824
Clear. Move!

86
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:07,529
Protect her!

87
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,168
Get down! Cover your ears. Cover your ears.

88
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:10,003
"Ice, move!"

89
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,234
Covering.

90
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:52,245
Move!

91
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:56,457
This behind me is the freighter suspected
of being attacked by an unknown virus.

92
00:15:56,555 --> 00:16:00,196
"It had a shuttle route,
ferrying goods between Thailand and Malaysia."

93
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:02,205
There were 14 crew members on board.

94
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:06,106
We can confirm all of them
have died from the illness.

95
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:09,874
The ACDC has yet to comment on this matter.

96
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,912
"Boss, It's Sean."

97
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,019
"Hey Tyler, did you see the news
about the Malaysian freighter?"

98
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,019
I saw it.

99
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:23,288
"3 months ago, you didn't believe
I had Kenner's mutated smallpox sample."

100
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:25,055
I told you I was going to get it.

101
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:27,430
Shall we continue with our business?

102
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,055
You remember Carnot?

103
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:29,961
I remember.

104
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:31,467
Carnot is extremely deadly

105
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,835
but we can't rely on body fluids
alone as a means of contraction.

106
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:37,134
Smallpox can be transmitted by air.

107
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:39,367
I combined the two together to create a new virus

108
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:42,207
that can be transmitted by air
without any other restrictions.

109
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,905
All vaccines from before will be useless.

110
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:46,345
It will cause more fear than AIDS.

111
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:48,017
That's impressive.

112
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,053
We already have the formula for
the vaccine and the medicine.

113
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:54,857
Our plan is to slowly spread
the virus across the 5 major continents.

114
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:57,985
The number of infections will
only take up a fraction of the population

115
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:01,055
and that will be enough to have
the world in a state of panic.

116
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:04,292
The market for the vaccine will be
much greater than the medicine.

117
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:08,237
We release the medicine and then
the vaccine and that's where the money comes in.

118
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:11,237
This will put you in the top ten
wealthiest men on earth.

119
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:14,342
"No matter how successful
your arms trade business is,"

120
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,403
it's nothing in comparison with
this bad boy.

121
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,412
"If you didn't become a wanted criminal,"

122
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:21,246
the new addition to the top ten
wealthiest men should be you.

123
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:23,547
I'd rather be the rich guy
that nobody knows about.

124
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:24,946
We'll be in touch.

125
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:30,459
"Kenner, stop running!"

126
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:31,993
Stop!

127
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:34,128
I said stop running!

128
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,228
Kenner!

129
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:38,568
"Son, what do you want to eat'?
Mom will cook it for you."

130
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:41,931
No way.

131
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:58,247
What is this'? What is this'?

132
00:17:58,343 --> 00:18:00,949
He escaped from the lab.
We went after him but...

133
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:02,389
well this happened.

134
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:07,354
Please tell me the stuff is still there.

135
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:11,492
It's all here.

136
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:28,941
Yeah it's me.

137
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,020
When will the specialist arrive?

138
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,248
One week later.

139
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:35,358
"Not only will she have to find
the Carnot sample,"

140
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:38,217
she'll have to finish Kenner's work.

141
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:41,921
"Find someone to handle it,
we can't be showing our faces around here."

142
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:48,435
The bullet shot into your skull

143
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:51,373
is lodged into the precentral gyrus
of the brain

144
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:53,433
and is sitting on the corpus callosum.

145
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:57,508
Your team of doctors have been through
your case many times these weeks.

146
00:18:57,903 --> 00:19:00,850
There's simply no safer way to
remove this bullet.

147
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:02,283
Will he live'?

148
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:06,451
Pressure is being exerted
on the corpus callosum of his brain.

149
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:09,959
This will cause major problems to
your entire nervous system.

150
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:13,495
Your body will gradually lose
the natural sensations it should have

151
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:19,064
"and as your case gets worse,
you will completely be paralyzed."

152
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:21,995
How much longer do I have'?

153
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,232
"Well, at this stage
you have about two weeks."

154
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:26,503
But we know you're not supposed to
leave the hospital

155
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:30,113
"because without the immediate medical
attention a hospital can give you,"

156
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:32,411
you will be at a greater risk.

157
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:44,425
Ice's ashes... have been sent back.

158
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:52,560
What happened between her and I...

159
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,534
Sorry.

160
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:11,888
I don't want to waste my time here.

161
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:14,956
I want to go home.

162
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:47,924
Mrs. Wan has been so worried about you
these months

163
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,454
that her sciatica has worsened.

164
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,486
Nurse Wang

165
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:56,422
"In two weeks,
I will be leaving on a long trip."

166
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,333
But you've just come home

167
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,995
Yes. I'll keep more money with you.

168
00:21:02,894 --> 00:21:04,237
Please continue to take care of my mother.

169
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:07,170
Don't worry. I'll stay and take care of her.

170
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:14,374
I didn't cook well today.

171
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,216
Mom's cooking always tastes so good.

172
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:35,828
What are you worried about?

173
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:38,098
I've recovered.

174
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:42,344
"I'm on leave,
so I can be with you every day."

175
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:43,973
Eat the food you cook.

176
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:54,486
To miss someone...

177
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,184
is a very painful thing.

178
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:03,864
"Those months while you were
in the hospital,"

179
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:07,161
I had the same dream almost every night.

180
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:11,463
Our whole family was at sea...

181
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,202
One by one you'd disappear

182
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:19,947
until only I was left.

183
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:24,376
"Jon,"

184
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:31,052
I have to tell you this.

185
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:36,962
I've always told you your father
abandoned us

186
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:40,798
but the one who gave up on this family...

187
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:43,929
WES me.

188
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:52,381
You're not my only son.

189
00:22:53,138 --> 00:22:54,845
You have an elder brother.

190
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,586
I married your father when I was 20.

191
00:22:59,344 --> 00:23:00,584
We enjoyed life.

192
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,993
I never thought about the future

193
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:09,524
"until I gave birth to you two boys,"

194
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:13,164
but your father didn't.

195
00:23:14,192 --> 00:23:15,569
He only cared about gambling.

196
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:19,832
He lost his job because of it

197
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:21,978
but he just gambled more

198
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,078
When you were 2

199
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:32,516
"I thought I'd bring you both with me
then make other plans,"

200
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,016
but I didn't count on

201
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:38,991
"your brother grasping my hand,
crying and"

202
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,529
refusing to let us go.

203
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:45,967
I was desperate;
afraid your father would come home.

204
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,996
"In the end,"

205
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,840
I carried you and left

206
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:55,536
and locked him in at home.

207
00:23:56,001 --> 00:24:00,108
When I was downstairs
I heard him crying and screaming

208
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:03,219
Mom! Don't go!

209
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:07,821
Mom...

210
00:24:08,246 --> 00:24:10,522
Don't be sad. It's in the past.

211
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,060
I've carried this guilt

212
00:24:20,892 --> 00:24:22,565
for over twenty years.

213
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:27,039
Jon

214
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:29,845
I finally got news of them.

215
00:24:30,235 --> 00:24:33,978
I was thinking of how to get
in touch with them.

216
00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:38,416
"But with your injury,
I was so afraid to lose..."

217
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,793
I'll bring them back.

218
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:53,894
Okay?

219
00:25:34,432 --> 00:25:40,041
The numerous crimes the Defendant
has committed over the years

220
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:46,486
indicates that he is a danger
to society and its people.

221
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:49,883
"Defendant Man Yeung,
On the charge of armed robbery"

222
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:55,081
"of the Black Pearl Jewelry Shop
on February 5, 2008,"

223
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:06,103
I find you guilty and sentence you
to ten years' imprisonment.

224
00:26:06,431 --> 00:26:13,406
"In addition, for resisting arrest
and attacking a police officer on November 1st, 2010,"

225
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:17,979
three years' imprisonment;

226
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:23,024
both sentences to be sewed concurrently.

227
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,129
Give me the keys!

228
00:27:51,536 --> 00:27:57,316
"Man Yeung, a 33 year old felon charged with
armed robbery and attacking a police officer,"

229
00:27:57,342 --> 00:28:03,224
escaped from the court house after
his trial this afternoon

230
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:06,328
byjumping off the fourth floor.

231
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:36,886
I found the guy who betrayed you.

232
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:38,322
You'll never guess who it is.

233
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,198
See?

234
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:48,562
Yeung

235
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:54,909
You know howl am...

236
00:28:54,966 --> 00:28:57,105
I did it only because I had no choice.

237
00:28:57,502 --> 00:28:59,812
"10 years of brotherhood, worth how much?"

238
00:28:59,971 --> 00:29:01,143
"30,000 bucks."

239
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:04,545
Yeung, I know I m not loyal

240
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:07,412
"I'll change, please give me a chance."

241
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:09,822
Just once...

242
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:14,089
"Yeung, please, just one chance"

243
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:16,092
"Spare me, please..."

244
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:17,992
Yeung!

245
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:27,272
The un-loyal can't stick around.

246
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:34,410
Where are you hiding now?

247
00:29:37,842 --> 00:29:41,051
You still don't trust me after so long'?

248
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:44,422
I'm a cop.

249
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:46,360
You don't trust a cop'?

250
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:51,334
"The pay is $200,000."

251
00:29:51,856 --> 00:29:53,233
After the job, you better disappe

252
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:56,166
If you don't...

253
00:29:56,528 --> 00:30:00,101
"It's not that you don't trust me,
it's me that can't trust you."

254
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:17,985
"Sir, I'm a doctor"

255
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:20,118
How is he'?

256
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:21,491
He's having a very severe headache.

257
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:23,396
I've already given him a shot of painkillers.

258
00:30:23,454 --> 00:30:25,127
May I see your medication?

259
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:29,163
Have you just had surgery'?

260
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:30,337
Yes.

261
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:34,106
"Doctor, what is his condition?"

262
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:35,473
I think it's the air pressure

263
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:37,308
that caused his headaches.

264
00:30:37,468 --> 00:30:40,472
"In any case, please lower the altitude
of the aircraft"

265
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,045
"or he may fall into a coma,"

266
00:30:42,207 --> 00:30:43,379
which will be very dangerous.

267
00:30:43,908 --> 00:30:45,478
I'll try to contact the control tower.

268
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:48,084
Julian, please inform Lump

269
00:30:58,323 --> 00:30:59,461
Feeling better?

270
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,497
"Yes, thanks."

271
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:05,431
You shouldn't fly right after such a major surgery.

272
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:08,408
May I know what surgery you had'?

273
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:12,137
I was shot in the head.
They couldn't remove the bullet.

274
00:31:14,072 --> 00:31:15,415
"Don't worry, I'm a cop."

275
00:31:17,508 --> 00:31:20,045
I know a very reputable neurosurgeon.

276
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:21,282
I can refer you.

277
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:22,356
Sure.

278
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:31,298
I'll meet you tomorrow.

279
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,035
Okay. Bye-bY9-

280
00:31:34,792 --> 00:31:36,897
Can you attend an appointment tomorrow?

281
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:38,199
"Yes, thank you."

282
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:39,468
You're welcome.

283
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:48,348
"I have a ride,
may I give you a lift?"

284
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:49,975
That's all right. I'll take a taxi.

285
00:31:50,108 --> 00:31:50,984
Dr. Kan.

286
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:52,147
Hi.

287
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:54,483
Stay in touch.
See you tomorrow.

288
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:08,954
The guy at the airport looked at me just now

289
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:19,505
Follow the white car ahead.

290
00:33:34,145 --> 00:33:35,021
Pull over.

291
00:33:40,385 --> 00:33:41,329
What happened?

292
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,392
Find a quiet place and finish him off.

293
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:44,411
Rachel...

294
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:01,328
So the guy who messed up our gig

295
00:36:01,459 --> 00:36:03,302
is your former teammate Jon Man.

296
00:36:04,395 --> 00:36:07,433
You almost killed him
and now running into him like this...

297
00:36:07,965 --> 00:36:09,137
What a coincidence.

298
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,841
Did you find out what he's here for'?

299
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:13,375
Visiting family.

300
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:17,110
When will your people make a move again?

301
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:18,185
Tonight.

302
00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:43,844
"Stop, Man Tin!"

303
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,046
Stand still!

304
00:36:59,183 --> 00:37:00,321
You run fast for a limp.

305
00:37:07,491 --> 00:37:09,528
"Damn gimp, you're quite a handful."

306
00:37:09,827 --> 00:37:13,070
My son always repaid my debts.

307
00:37:13,164 --> 00:37:15,235
Your son is in trouble himself.
How can he help you'?

308
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:16,243
Hey!

309
00:37:18,035 --> 00:37:19,036
None of your business.

310
00:37:21,505 --> 00:37:23,815
I'll be after you. Let's go.

311
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:30,155
Thank you.

312
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:33,460
I'm Jon Man.

313
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:58,010
"Chef Man, my buddy!"

314
00:37:58,042 --> 00:37:58,486
Tin!

315
00:37:58,542 --> 00:38:01,079
Lend me your wok. My son is back.

316
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:02,583
Yeung is here'?

317
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:04,015
God dammit!

318
00:38:04,081 --> 00:38:06,027
"My younger son, Jon."

319
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,494
You have a younger son'?

320
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,393
Help yourself. Don't be shy.

321
00:38:26,037 --> 00:38:27,948
"You're cooking, Grandpa?"

322
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:29,546
Champ

323
00:38:30,441 --> 00:38:32,580
Bring the dish to your uncle.

324
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:34,820
I have an uncle'?

325
00:38:34,912 --> 00:38:36,118
Just bring it over.

326
00:38:36,213 --> 00:38:37,419
He's at the last table.

327
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:38,789
Okay.

328
00:38:40,518 --> 00:38:41,553
"Hello, Uncle."

329
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,326
Can you understand Mandarin?

330
00:38:44,922 --> 00:38:45,866
What's your name'?

331
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:46,934
Champ.

332
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,202
It sounds like a boy's name.

333
00:38:50,227 --> 00:38:51,262
Grandpa named me.

334
00:38:51,395 --> 00:38:54,035
He said it's suitable for a boy or girl.

335
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:57,803
"In gambling as in life,
one must always win."

336
00:38:59,136 --> 00:39:01,377
Champ! Come back to eat!

337
00:39:01,572 --> 00:39:03,483
Coming!

338
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:09,889
Damn!

339
00:39:10,214 --> 00:39:11,522
That was like a dream.

340
00:39:11,982 --> 00:39:15,054
It's been 29 years.
I didn't think I'd see you again.

341
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:18,391
I'm sure your mother
doesn't feed you well.

342
00:39:18,923 --> 00:39:21,335
She didn't even know how much water
to use to cook rice.

343
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:26,098
She cooks... well now.

344
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:32,439
"Poor thing,
she has to cook for herself."

345
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:37,210
"So, how is she doing?"

346
00:39:40,077 --> 00:39:41,385
She has sciatica.

347
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:43,052
"She can't walk well, needs a wheelchair."

348
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,558
That's fate.

349
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:48,558
I m lame, she s in a wheelch

350
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:52,330
"God damn, even as a lame
she's better off than me."

351
00:39:54,091 --> 00:39:55,434
She wants to see you and brother.

352
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:59,170
So we must go'? Is she the queen'?

353
00:39:59,263 --> 00:40:01,869
"Don't talk about her,
it makes me angry."

354
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:03,238
Come...

355
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:05,806
Have a drink with your old man.

356
00:40:16,046 --> 00:40:16,990
Thanks.

357
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:19,925
That's a lot of money.

358
00:40:20,785 --> 00:40:22,264
Grandpa put me in charge of money.

359
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:25,391
He said we'd starve if he held the cash.

360
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:32,835
"Uncle, there's Grandpa's bed."

361
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:46,944
Champ

362
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:48,321
What are you doing'?

363
00:40:48,412 --> 00:40:50,949
They're all perfect scores.
Why are you burning them'?

364
00:40:51,382 --> 00:40:52,952
They're useless.

365
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:54,426
What do you mean'?

366
00:40:56,086 --> 00:40:58,498
"Three years ago, dad promised me"

367
00:40:58,923 --> 00:41:01,369
"if I got a 1OO 100% "

368
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:03,266
he'd give up being a bad guy

369
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,033
and come back to live with us.

370
00:41:05,095 --> 00:41:06,369
I want him to come back

371
00:41:06,497 --> 00:41:09,341
so I worked really hard.

372
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:12,039
I did everything he asked.

373
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:15,242
"I just asked him to do one thing,
but he didn't."

374
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:21,919
"Champ, your dad is a bad guy?"

375
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:27,190
"Read this, Uncle."

376
00:41:30,287 --> 00:41:31,994
Head Culprit of Armed Robbery Escapes

377
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:41,499
What is your name'? Where do you live'?

378
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:43,804
Only you live in Kowloon City'?

379
00:41:44,101 --> 00:41:45,546
Why didn't you bring your I.D. card'?

380
00:41:47,938 --> 00:41:49,178
You know what to do.

381
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:53,119
Grandpa is always like that.

382
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:10,299
Dr. Kan. Are you all right'?

383
00:42:11,228 --> 00:42:13,208
I m fine, its just a scratch

384
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:15,935
The research report for the mutated
smallpox came out today.

385
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,879
"It's confidential,
so I must give it to you in person."

386
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:23,410
This mutated strain is many times more viral

387
00:42:23,507 --> 00:42:27,387
so we tried to adapt a new vaccine
from the old formula.

388
00:42:27,811 --> 00:42:29,256
Progress is optimistic.

389
00:42:30,247 --> 00:42:32,056
And this virus...

390
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:33,923
is definitely related to Kenner

391
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:36,195
but I don't understand.

392
00:42:37,087 --> 00:42:37,792
What'?

393
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:40,368
"If Kenner wanted to make a bio-weapon,"

394
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:43,563
why would he make this simple virus?

395
00:42:44,962 --> 00:42:47,169
I'm worried that he's making something

396
00:42:47,498 --> 00:42:49,876
much more than a mutated smallpox.

397
00:42:54,371 --> 00:42:56,578
LBK is a first-class pharmaceutical plant.

398
00:42:56,974 --> 00:42:59,978
I negotiated a million-dollar contract for you

399
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:02,286
but you just turned Mr. Levinson down flat.

400
00:43:02,479 --> 00:43:03,890
I'm so embarrassed.

401
00:43:04,481 --> 00:43:06,290
I love my currentjob.

402
00:43:06,517 --> 00:43:08,519
You can help people
in a pharmaceutical plant.

403
00:43:08,786 --> 00:43:10,424
Everyone in the world will benefit.

404
00:43:10,888 --> 00:43:12,231
I don't understand how you think.

405
00:43:12,289 --> 00:43:15,395
Mom, you told me all their trick

406
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:18,165
Not every pharmaceutical company is bad.

407
00:43:20,864 --> 00:43:23,970
How much conscience can
a multi- billion dollar business have'?

408
00:43:27,571 --> 00:43:28,481
Forget it.

409
00:43:58,569 --> 00:44:00,105
You're full of excuses.

410
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:02,181
"Stop already, Mom."

411
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,513
What is this'? Rachel!

412
00:44:05,242 --> 00:44:06,220
Run!

413
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:16,362
This is what I want.

414
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:20,359
Carnot sample?

415
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:23,563
Go to ACDC tomorrow and get it for me
from the virus sample storage.

416
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:27,408
I cannot remove any virus samples from the lab.

417
00:44:28,365 --> 00:44:28,934
Mom...

418
00:44:28,966 --> 00:44:31,276
"Get it,
and nothing happens to your mother."

419
00:44:49,053 --> 00:44:51,294
This is Rachel Kan. Please leave a message.

420
00:44:51,388 --> 00:44:53,129
I will get back to you as soon as possible.

421
00:45:08,072 --> 00:45:10,848
"Dr Kan, these are..."

422
00:45:11,008 --> 00:45:13,921
"Reporters, here to interview me."

423
00:45:42,339 --> 00:45:45,081
"Hand over your guns, on the floor!"

424
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:50,517
All set here.

425
00:45:51,215 --> 00:45:52,250
Good.

426
00:45:52,816 --> 00:45:53,294
Get out.

427
00:46:15,539 --> 00:46:18,247
"Sir, you cannot park here."

428
00:46:18,308 --> 00:46:19,878
I'm waiting for someone.
I'll be leaving soon.

429
00:46:20,377 --> 00:46:21,822
GO HS SOON HS YOU CHH.

430
00:48:08,452 --> 00:48:10,090
"Dr.Kan, I need to examine
what's in your hands..."

431
00:48:12,456 --> 00:48:13,161
Stop!

432
00:48:31,275 --> 00:48:32,948
"Calling control room,
calling control room..."

433
00:48:35,445 --> 00:48:36,287
Freeze!

434
00:49:31,234 --> 00:49:33,043
"If they get caught, we're in trouble."

435
00:49:33,103 --> 00:49:34,207
Get rid of them.

436
00:49:37,874 --> 00:49:40,218
Police! Get out! Get out!

437
00:50:21,284 --> 00:50:21,887
Hello'?

438
00:50:21,985 --> 00:50:23,931
"Dad, bring Champ to the train station now."

439
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:24,556
"What's going on, Yeung?"

440
00:50:24,821 --> 00:50:26,095
"Don't ask, just go now!"

441
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:28,927
Turn around. Go to the train station!

442
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:36,377
"Miss, can you hear me'? Are you okay?"

443
00:50:36,566 --> 00:50:39,012
There are two injured civilians
outside the ACDC...

444
00:51:42,132 --> 00:51:43,133
Don't kill a cop!

445
00:51:44,167 --> 00:51:45,145
I'm your younger brother!

446
00:51:52,209 --> 00:51:53,347
Those cops are in on it!

447
00:52:25,509 --> 00:52:26,487
Jon! Get in!

448
00:53:32,342 --> 00:53:33,252
Sit tight!

449
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:49,298
Police! Move! Move! Move!

450
00:54:05,041 --> 00:54:06,384
"Yeung, we're at the train station."

451
00:54:06,443 --> 00:54:07,251
Wait at the ticket office.

452
00:54:08,311 --> 00:54:09,483
Move! Police!

453
00:54:12,282 --> 00:54:13,317
Find a vantage point.

454
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:22,369
Speak.

455
00:54:22,459 --> 00:54:24,302
Man Tin is at the station
and made a phone call.

456
00:54:24,561 --> 00:54:27,337
"Keep your eye on him.
Anything happens, take the girl."

457
00:54:27,364 --> 00:54:29,401
Don't come over.
Police are tailing you.

458
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:30,308
What's going on'?

459
00:54:30,367 --> 00:54:32,142
The police want to kill me.
I can't come out.

460
00:54:32,402 --> 00:54:34,507
I'll leave you tickets. Wait for my call.

461
00:55:33,363 --> 00:55:34,433
You see the electronic appliances booth'?

462
00:55:34,531 --> 00:55:35,271
Yes.

463
00:55:35,298 --> 00:55:36,174
Walk over there.

464
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:44,507
Stop.

465
00:55:54,451 --> 00:55:55,452
Do you see his father?

466
00:55:57,387 --> 00:55:58,365
Do you see his father?

467
00:55:58,521 --> 00:55:59,556
Near the convenience store!

468
00:56:01,458 --> 00:56:03,267
"Dad, board the train;
I'll come for you."

469
00:56:09,399 --> 00:56:10,469
Hurry! Hurry!

470
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:30,262
Grandpa!

471
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:31,525
"Champ, go!"

472
00:56:32,021 --> 00:56:32,931
Go!

473
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:37,803
Hurry

474
00:56:47,804 --> 00:56:48,839
Catch the train!

475
00:57:06,356 --> 00:57:10,998
The train to Gemas is about to depart.

476
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:14,439
All passengers please abroad now.

477
00:57:24,808 --> 00:57:25,946
Go on!

478
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:39,257
"Call HQ, contact
the Railway Department!"

479
00:57:49,933 --> 00:57:51,537
How's Yeung'?

480
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:53,443
He couldn't get on'?

481
00:57:56,873 --> 00:57:58,910
"Look, Champ, it's Dad."

482
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:01,584
Dad...

483
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:04,848
Champ

484
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:15,234
Yeung.
Dad.

485
00:58:15,892 --> 00:58:17,030
Sit.

486
00:58:23,266 --> 00:58:26,042
"Yeung, he's your younger brother."

487
00:58:37,914 --> 00:58:39,018
Turn yourself in.

488
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:42,491
Those cops are in on this.

489
00:58:42,785 --> 00:58:44,162
Turning himself in would be suicide.

490
00:58:45,255 --> 00:58:46,529
You were once a cop too.

491
00:58:56,266 --> 00:58:57,973
Have you thought about Champ'?

492
00:58:58,935 --> 00:59:00,346
She can't lose you.

493
00:59:02,138 --> 00:59:04,982
Do you want her to spend her life
in hiding with you'?

494
00:59:12,782 --> 00:59:13,954
Turn yourself in with me.

495
00:59:16,786 --> 00:59:18,231
Stop it! Get out! Get out!

496
00:59:18,288 --> 00:59:19,130
We're not going to see your mother!

497
00:59:19,188 --> 00:59:20,428
You're so selfish.

498
00:59:20,924 --> 00:59:22,835
"Had you thought about your family,
you wouldn't be here now."

499
00:59:22,859 --> 00:59:23,860
And you call yourself a father.

500
00:59:24,193 --> 00:59:25,433
That's not up to you to say!

501
00:59:31,868 --> 00:59:32,312
Yeung!

502
00:59:32,368 --> 00:59:33,938
"Yeung, stop it!"

503
00:59:34,137 --> 00:59:36,139
Yeung! Stop!

504
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:38,519
"Quit it, you two..."

505
00:59:39,275 --> 00:59:40,549
"Stop, Yeung!"

506
00:59:40,810 --> 00:59:43,518
Stop it...

507
00:59:49,152 --> 00:59:50,392
Stop in

508
00:59:52,555 --> 00:59:56,230
It's my fault. I was never good enough.

509
00:59:56,459 --> 00:59:59,497
That's why your mom left Yeung and I.

510
01:00:00,296 --> 01:00:02,071
Did she ever consider...

511
01:00:02,565 --> 01:00:06,274
A broken mirror can never be whole again?

512
01:00:07,203 --> 01:00:10,514
Your brother and I chose the same path.

513
01:00:12,075 --> 01:00:13,383
He is a thief

514
01:00:13,876 --> 01:00:16,322
but he's a righteous thief

515
01:00:16,546 --> 01:00:19,322
who takes good care of Champ and me.

516
01:00:21,217 --> 01:00:23,390
I'm the one responsible for this.

517
01:00:23,886 --> 01:00:26,890
I took away decades of love between
you brothers.

518
01:00:27,223 --> 01:00:28,361
Jon...

519
01:00:29,525 --> 01:00:31,903
You must forgive him.

520
01:00:34,364 --> 01:00:37,402
I can't. I'm a cop.

521
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:44,478
Jon...

522
01:00:46,042 --> 01:00:47,248
"What's wrong, Jon?"

523
01:00:52,949 --> 01:00:55,020
Evacuate the workers in the depot now.

524
01:00:55,118 --> 01:00:56,961
We'll arrest them when the train stops.

525
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:11,311
Delay those cops!

526
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:22,987
"Dad, somethings wrong.
We need to go."

527
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:32,058
Take care.

528
01:02:02,985 --> 01:02:04,225
Police. Don't move!

529
01:02:04,921 --> 01:02:05,899
Take Champ and hide.

530
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:13,870
Outlaws on the train...

531
01:02:14,063 --> 01:02:15,474
You are surrounded by police.

532
01:02:15,832 --> 01:02:18,312
Turn in your weapons and surrender now.

533
01:02:36,986 --> 01:02:37,964
Stop!

534
01:02:39,055 --> 01:02:40,193
Don't hurt my family!

535
01:02:52,068 --> 01:02:54,275
Yeung! Take Champ and run!

536
01:02:54,470 --> 01:02:56,472
Leave me behind. I can't get away.

537
01:02:57,273 --> 01:02:58,274
Hurry!

538
01:02:59,108 --> 01:03:00,178
"Come out, Champ."

539
01:03:00,843 --> 01:03:01,480
Go!

540
01:03:01,577 --> 01:03:02,578
Cover your ears.

541
01:03:05,081 --> 01:03:06,458
Move! Move!

542
01:03:08,417 --> 01:03:09,555
Go!

543
01:03:14,090 --> 01:03:15,034
"Champ, come down."

544
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:17,897
Champ!

545
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:19,266
Help...

546
01:03:20,029 --> 01:03:20,837
Champ!

547
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:40,448
Hands up!

548
01:04:57,994 --> 01:04:59,940
Man Yeung has many hideouts.
I'll go look for him.

549
01:05:00,329 --> 01:05:01,330
Hide the girl.

550
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:01,999
"Yes, sir."

551
01:05:02,031 --> 01:05:02,975
Get in.

552
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:24,553
"In any case, you shouldn't have run away
with your brother."

553
01:06:25,915 --> 01:06:29,886
You are now a suspect in the ACDC case.

554
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:33,061
"I believe you'd never do this,"

555
01:06:33,222 --> 01:06:35,224
but only I believe you.

556
01:06:35,291 --> 01:06:38,829
"As long as your brother is at large,
you're implicated."

557
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:44,900
Just don't let anything happen to my brother.

558
01:06:45,901 --> 01:06:47,346
But he is a repeat felon.

559
01:06:47,436 --> 01:06:48,915
How can I help him'?

560
01:06:57,113 --> 01:06:59,423
"Damn, he's Yeung's brother."

561
01:06:59,548 --> 01:07:01,789
His oral statement
indicates our involvement.

562
01:07:03,085 --> 01:07:05,861
"Don't worry,
we're halfway through this."

563
01:07:06,122 --> 01:07:09,296
"When the hospital quiets down,
kill him."

564
01:07:10,159 --> 01:07:11,934
"Sean, I want to talk to you"

565
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:14,030
about your former partner Jon Man.

566
01:07:38,254 --> 01:07:39,995
"Doctor, why so late?"

567
01:09:06,275 --> 01:09:07,310
You want to kill me'?

568
01:09:07,576 --> 01:09:10,147
Give me my daughter back.
I'll give you your stuff.

569
01:09:27,496 --> 01:09:29,032
Quick. Where are you keeping her'?

570
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:32,945
Speak!

571
01:09:34,904 --> 01:09:36,110
She's in the old building on Pudu Street.

572
01:09:43,812 --> 01:09:44,882
Where is my daughter?

573
01:09:45,781 --> 01:09:46,418
Where is my daughter?

574
01:09:46,515 --> 01:09:47,892
I'll kill your daughter...

575
01:09:49,418 --> 01:09:50,226
Where is my daughter?

576
01:09:50,286 --> 01:09:51,959
I'll take you there...

577
01:10:24,153 --> 01:10:25,029
Hey!

578
01:10:32,928 --> 01:10:34,532
Help!

579
01:10:35,297 --> 01:10:40,144
Help...

580
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:47,320
Where is my daughter?

581
01:11:09,798 --> 01:11:11,971
"Last night, someone tried to kill me
at the hospital."

582
01:11:12,401 --> 01:11:13,573
They were Russell's men.

583
01:11:14,036 --> 01:11:15,310
There is no use telling me this now.

584
01:11:15,471 --> 01:11:18,816
"You're on the most wanted list,
with orders to shoot to kill."

585
01:11:19,041 --> 01:11:21,920
"Do me a favor Jon, turn yourself in.
Surrender."

586
01:11:21,977 --> 01:11:24,048
Not yet. I know where Champ is

587
01:11:25,781 --> 01:11:26,555
Don't act rash.

588
01:11:42,298 --> 01:11:43,242
Jon?

589
01:11:45,367 --> 01:11:46,402
"Walter, Ross."

590
01:12:08,424 --> 01:12:09,926
Go secure the entrance.

591
01:12:39,088 --> 01:12:40,362
"You know,"

592
01:12:43,192 --> 01:12:45,172
I never told Russell to harm yo

593
01:12:45,461 --> 01:12:47,270
he's the one that sold you out.

594
01:12:48,230 --> 01:12:49,504
Go get the money.

595
01:13:05,214 --> 01:13:08,525
"That's 600,000 dollars.
Let's make this simple,"

596
01:13:09,218 --> 01:13:13,428
"you give me what I want,
you can have your daughter back."

597
01:13:14,256 --> 01:13:15,428
You have my word.

598
01:13:20,028 --> 01:13:21,803
Go tell Keith to bring his daughter up.

599
01:13:23,499 --> 01:13:25,240
Bring Dr. Kan and her mom over.

600
01:13:30,506 --> 01:13:31,917
Where's my stuff'?

601
01:13:44,887 --> 01:13:49,358
"Dr. Kan, there's a USB drive on the desk,
with the formula in it."

602
01:13:49,491 --> 01:13:54,372
"You need to extract the smallpox DNA
and carnot RNA specified in the formula,"

603
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:55,568
do you understand?

604
01:13:55,998 --> 01:13:58,501
Combine them together to create
the mutated virus.

605
01:13:58,567 --> 01:14:01,946
"Now, I know what the formation
should look like,"

606
01:14:02,137 --> 01:14:03,980
so please do not be sneaky.

607
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:07,345
"If it doesn't match,
you'll watch your mom die."

608
01:16:36,825 --> 01:16:38,031
Let us go now.

609
01:16:40,429 --> 01:16:42,204
"You're an expert on viruses,"

610
01:16:44,032 --> 01:16:47,241
you should know that the human body
is the most ideal incubator.

611
01:16:48,470 --> 01:16:49,471
What do you want'?

612
01:16:54,810 --> 01:16:56,949
Please don't hurt my mother...

613
01:16:57,079 --> 01:16:59,059
I've given you everything you want...

614
01:17:01,316 --> 01:17:02,386
Freeze!

615
01:17:08,190 --> 01:17:09,464
Hand over your guns!

616
01:17:10,525 --> 01:17:12,471
"Sean, only two fingers."

617
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:19,074
You know I'm faster than you right'?

618
01:17:21,436 --> 01:17:22,915
Take your jacket off

619
01:17:30,779 --> 01:17:35,194
Hey! You and me...we're the same.

620
01:17:36,818 --> 01:17:38,229
All we want is the money.

621
01:17:40,322 --> 01:17:42,097
"But if you let him ruin everything,"

622
01:17:43,191 --> 01:17:45,193
"not only will you lose the money,"

623
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:47,267
"you'll never see your daughter again,"

624
01:17:48,296 --> 01:17:49,331
eve F

625
01:17:53,435 --> 01:17:56,109
We will rescue Champ. Don't let him go.

626
01:18:27,803 --> 01:18:28,975
Get down!

627
01:20:25,353 --> 01:20:27,094
"Man Yeung, stop!"

628
01:21:27,449 --> 01:21:29,122
"Sean, you go first!"

629
01:22:10,125 --> 01:22:11,229
Why did you do that'?

630
01:22:11,393 --> 01:22:13,339
Ice was collateral damage.

631
01:22:13,995 --> 01:22:15,338
It's over.

632
01:22:15,563 --> 01:22:19,568
Only I have the antidote in the whole world.

633
01:22:20,902 --> 01:22:22,245
Let me go

634
01:22:23,538 --> 01:22:25,176
or she will be the next collateral damage.

635
01:22:29,411 --> 01:22:32,858
Bring Dr. Kan for the girl. I'll call you.

636
01:22:53,535 --> 01:22:55,845
Man Yeung! Stop running!

637
01:23:03,178 --> 01:23:04,282
Get in.

638
01:23:15,290 --> 01:23:17,463
Do they still have Champ'?

639
01:23:19,227 --> 01:23:20,797
You'll die if you don't go to the hospital.

640
01:23:20,862 --> 01:23:22,307
I won't go!

641
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,104
Brother...

642
01:23:27,268 --> 01:23:28,542
Help me...

643
01:23:30,105 --> 01:23:31,413
Just this once.

644
01:25:06,401 --> 01:25:08,108
"20-some years since
we've seen each other,"

645
01:25:08,837 --> 01:25:12,148
I wouldn't have guessed
you'd see me like this.

646
01:25:20,215 --> 01:25:21,523
When we were kids...

647
01:25:22,484 --> 01:25:23,861
What were we like'?

648
01:25:25,086 --> 01:25:28,260
You were two;
you were like a lump of tofu.

649
01:25:31,292 --> 01:25:33,329
Your nickname was Tofu.

650
01:25:34,462 --> 01:25:35,998
Mom told me.

651
01:25:36,965 --> 01:25:38,535
I've always loved eating her tofu soup.

652
01:25:42,303 --> 01:25:44,943
"Brother, forgive mom."

653
01:25:46,541 --> 01:25:47,918
She feels so much guilt.

654
01:25:49,210 --> 01:25:50,917
We've been apart for so long.

655
01:25:52,247 --> 01:25:56,354
I have no feelings for her.
She's a stranger.

656
01:25:59,487 --> 01:26:02,957
I felt nothing for dad when I first came.

657
01:26:04,092 --> 01:26:05,799
I'd been fatherless for over 20 years...

658
01:26:09,931 --> 01:26:12,377
"But when he fell in front of me,"

659
01:26:13,034 --> 01:26:14,479
I felt him return

660
01:26:24,412 --> 01:26:28,292
What dad and
I have is different from you.

661
01:26:29,817 --> 01:26:33,026
Dad brought me here when I was 12.

662
01:26:33,288 --> 01:26:34,892
He still loved to gamble.

663
01:26:35,823 --> 01:26:37,234
I hated him.

664
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:40,271
I was determined to
make something of myself

665
01:26:40,295 --> 01:26:41,569
so no one would despise me.

666
01:26:41,896 --> 01:26:44,103
I chose this path when I was 16.

667
01:26:44,866 --> 01:26:47,904
"A few years later, I stole my boss' stock."

668
01:26:59,414 --> 01:27:01,394
No!

669
01:27:01,482 --> 01:27:04,429
"$200,000.. Thank you!"

670
01:27:04,452 --> 01:27:07,023
"Thank you Boss,
for sparing his life!"

671
01:27:07,488 --> 01:27:09,968
"You're lucky you got the money,
you degenerate gambler."

672
01:27:10,058 --> 01:27:12,402
He would have died here tonight.

673
01:27:12,493 --> 01:27:15,872
I guarantee my son
will never touch your stuff.

674
01:27:16,030 --> 01:27:17,134
Thank you.

675
01:27:17,198 --> 01:27:19,371
Not that way... this way.

676
01:27:20,368 --> 01:27:22,848
Gui said you would take it easy on us.

677
01:27:23,004 --> 01:27:24,108
He's right.

678
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:26,150
Why else would I have taken your money'?

679
01:27:26,241 --> 01:27:27,982
I have a reputation to uphold.

680
01:27:28,076 --> 01:27:29,987
This is only the 6th floor.

681
01:27:30,445 --> 01:27:32,356
"If you both jump off,"

682
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:34,323
I'll leave this all behind.

683
01:27:45,927 --> 01:27:48,237
"Son, be brave."

684
01:27:49,397 --> 01:27:51,172
We're both tough.

685
01:27:51,299 --> 01:27:52,403
Let's go!

686
01:28:00,842 --> 01:28:03,482
Don't die...

687
01:28:06,180 --> 01:28:08,922
"Yeung, don't die."

688
01:28:11,886 --> 01:28:15,265
"What I share with dad,
you'll never have."

689
01:28:23,131 --> 01:28:25,441
"Dispatch,
there is a suspected fugitive vehicle."

690
01:28:25,466 --> 01:28:26,240
Requesting confirmation.

691
01:28:27,402 --> 01:28:28,904
I know dad was a bad cop.

692
01:28:29,904 --> 01:28:33,374
I became a cop so mom would forget him.

693
01:28:34,509 --> 01:28:36,250
But I never imagined...

694
01:28:37,478 --> 01:28:39,287
Mom would miss you guys so much.

695
01:28:43,818 --> 01:28:45,058
Please go see her.

696
01:28:47,021 --> 01:28:48,864
"How can I, with the way I am now?"

697
01:28:56,564 --> 01:28:57,907
This is from mom.

698
01:29:02,236 --> 01:29:03,374
Don't make it worse for yourself.

699
01:29:12,046 --> 01:29:14,151
Freeze! Freeze! Don't move!

700
01:29:18,786 --> 01:29:21,164
You took my daughter; what do you want'?

701
01:29:21,356 --> 01:29:23,267
Take care of something for me first.

702
01:29:23,558 --> 01:29:27,529
"At 10:00, Dr. Kan will be escorted by
the IDC to the Police Air Base."

703
01:29:27,995 --> 01:29:30,839
Take her out and meet me
at Golden Triangle at 10:30.

704
01:29:45,780 --> 01:29:49,887
"Yeung, I know you won't forgive me."

705
01:29:53,254 --> 01:29:55,427
Sean wants me in exchange for your niece'?

706
01:29:55,957 --> 01:29:58,369
They can cultivate the virus using her body.

707
01:29:58,926 --> 01:30:01,429
But they need you; there must be
unfinished business.

708
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:03,334
"I'm worried about Champ, too."

709
01:30:03,431 --> 01:30:05,968
The virus has been inside her for 24 hours.

710
01:30:06,100 --> 01:30:08,444
"If she's not injected with the antidote in 10 hours,"

711
01:30:09,203 --> 01:30:10,113
she will die.

712
01:30:10,438 --> 01:30:13,885
IDC is taking me
to the Singapore Medical Authority

713
01:30:13,908 --> 01:30:16,047
"so I can research and manufacture an antidote,"

714
01:30:16,244 --> 01:30:18,952
but we cannot finish the job in 10 hours

715
01:30:19,113 --> 01:30:23,186
"Then, I become an accomplice
in her murder."

716
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:27,866
"Dr Kan, we have to go. Come on."

717
01:30:27,922 --> 01:30:28,992
Ross.

718
01:30:29,290 --> 01:30:30,291
Ross.

719
01:30:31,058 --> 01:30:33,971
Sean still needs Rachel; I can lure him out.

720
01:30:34,095 --> 01:30:35,130
Let me out first.

721
01:30:35,296 --> 01:30:38,175
Jon, even though Dr. Kan s statement
favors you,"

722
01:30:38,332 --> 01:30:39,276
they're not going to release you.

723
01:30:39,467 --> 01:30:41,242
It's not our turf.

724
01:30:43,171 --> 01:30:46,448
They're going to transfer you
to a maximum security prison.

725
01:30:46,541 --> 01:30:49,488
I'm trying every single way possible to
locate Sean and your brother.

726
01:30:49,577 --> 01:30:52,057
I need to get them before I can get you out of here.

727
01:30:52,380 --> 01:30:53,222
Wait for me.

728
01:30:53,314 --> 01:30:54,349
I'm out of time.

729
01:30:54,549 --> 01:30:56,119
You know I don't have time!

730
01:30:58,986 --> 01:31:01,296
Ross! Ross!

731
01:31:04,826 --> 01:31:06,533
"Chopper 4, 3 minutes to tower."

732
01:32:26,507 --> 01:32:27,485
That's a very serious crime.

733
01:32:27,542 --> 01:32:28,452
I don't have a choice.

734
01:32:28,543 --> 01:32:29,886
You must help me.

735
01:32:30,978 --> 01:32:32,480
Only you can help me find Sean.

736
01:32:34,215 --> 01:32:35,125
Please.

737
01:33:22,063 --> 01:33:23,098
Get off!

738
01:33:24,298 --> 01:33:26,471
Man Yeung! Put the gun down!

739
01:33:27,802 --> 01:33:29,907
Jon escaped. He's coming here.

740
01:34:19,854 --> 01:34:21,231
"What you just did, there's no turning back."

741
01:34:36,137 --> 01:34:38,208
"Chopper 1, Chopper 2, ready for take off."

742
01:34:38,305 --> 01:34:41,843
Chopper 4 has been taken hostage.
Get ready to chase Chopper 4.

743
01:34:41,942 --> 01:34:44,047
"Control, please locate Chopper 4 now."

744
01:34:45,012 --> 01:34:46,423
Land at Golden Triangle.

745
01:34:47,782 --> 01:34:48,886
Sean wants me to hand over the hostage there.

746
01:34:50,451 --> 01:34:53,091
Chopper 4 is over Bukit Bintang
heading towards Puchong.

747
01:34:58,793 --> 01:34:59,897
Tactical Low!

748
01:35:05,466 --> 01:35:08,470
"This is Chopper 1,
Chopper 4 has changed direction."

749
01:35:08,903 --> 01:35:11,144
All ground units head towards Golden Triangle.

750
01:35:15,443 --> 01:35:17,150
Dive down. Faster.

751
01:35:59,386 --> 01:36:01,229
Attention all ground units.

752
01:36:01,288 --> 01:36:04,895
The helicopter kidnapped by the suspect
has already changed direction

753
01:36:04,959 --> 01:36:06,404
heading towards Golden Triangle.

754
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:09,097
Please respond to location immediately.

755
01:36:12,566 --> 01:36:13,840
Bank left!

756
01:36:53,908 --> 01:36:55,285
Attention all ground units.

757
01:36:55,376 --> 01:36:58,050
Immediately go to Tun Razak car park area.

758
01:36:58,179 --> 01:37:02,184
Suspect helicopter will be landing shortly.
Zero in on the prohibited area.

759
01:37:02,283 --> 01:37:05,890
All officers from zone A and B please
rush to the area.

760
01:37:07,087 --> 01:37:09,192
Put it on.
I can track you if anything happens.

761
01:37:16,964 --> 01:37:18,841
"Sean, we're at Golden Triangle."

762
01:37:18,999 --> 01:37:21,070
There are two cars
parked on the shoulder across the street.

763
01:37:21,135 --> 01:37:22,239
Go there and wait.

764
01:39:57,091 --> 01:39:58,502
Lucky you made it in time.

765
01:40:00,160 --> 01:40:01,002
Don't worry...

766
01:40:01,095 --> 01:40:03,473
There's still time to see where you rank
in the top ten wealthiest.

767
01:40:19,346 --> 01:40:21,792
You should know how much time the girl has left.

768
01:40:23,150 --> 01:40:26,927
There's eleven of Kenner's formulas inside that PDA.

769
01:40:27,221 --> 01:40:28,529
"You created the virus,"

770
01:40:28,856 --> 01:40:31,302
no one is more clear
on its variables than you.

771
01:40:31,959 --> 01:40:35,133
Analyze each formula to
get the right combination

772
01:40:35,262 --> 01:40:37,572
to create the medicine and the vaccine.

773
01:40:37,965 --> 01:40:39,342
"It's all up to you, doctor."

774
01:40:39,800 --> 01:40:41,404
Tell the captain to start the engine.

775
01:40:41,568 --> 01:40:42,478
All right.

776
01:41:09,496 --> 01:41:11,237
"Mark, the vaccine is being made."

777
01:41:11,532 --> 01:41:12,408
The girl is useless.

778
01:41:12,499 --> 01:41:13,443
Get rid of her.

779
01:41:41,562 --> 01:41:44,042
"Champ, Champ..."

780
01:42:49,963 --> 01:42:51,033
Champ...

781
01:42:52,132 --> 01:42:53,270
Champ...

782
01:42:54,334 --> 01:42:55,312
Yeung!

783
01:43:09,183 --> 01:43:10,093
"Sean, Sean..."

784
01:43:25,966 --> 01:43:26,842
Don't open it.

785
01:43:27,167 --> 01:43:28,976
Sean has injected the virus into Champ.

786
01:43:36,810 --> 01:43:39,450
I heard them say Dr. Kan
is making the antidote.

787
01:43:41,815 --> 01:43:43,419
"Hide Champ, I'll go find Rachel."

788
01:43:43,550 --> 01:43:45,257
Go to the engine room and keep them
from starting the ship.

789
01:43:48,155 --> 01:43:48,997
Be careful.

790
01:43:50,390 --> 01:43:51,334
Stay in touch.

791
01:44:39,539 --> 01:44:42,383
"Mike, why haven't we started moving yet?"

792
01:44:43,343 --> 01:44:44,822
Well go and find out what's going on.

793
01:45:14,174 --> 01:45:15,050
Grenade!

794
01:45:19,212 --> 01:45:20,054
Rachel.

795
01:45:29,323 --> 01:45:30,495
The antidote formulas are all in here.

796
01:45:30,557 --> 01:45:31,535
"Don't lose it. Go, quickly."

797
01:45:41,001 --> 01:45:41,809
Go!

798
01:45:47,341 --> 01:45:48,376
Are you ok'?

799
01:45:51,778 --> 01:45:53,155
Shoot if anything happens.

800
01:46:34,154 --> 01:46:35,531
Catch it. Go.

801
01:47:14,394 --> 01:47:16,499
"Yeung, Rachel fell under the deck."

802
01:47:16,863 --> 01:47:17,864
I'm going down now.

803
01:47:18,365 --> 01:47:19,275
I'll come over.

804
01:48:18,358 --> 01:48:20,099
It's alright...

805
01:48:21,294 --> 01:48:22,534
PDA...

806
01:48:23,430 --> 01:48:25,205
I dropped the PDA...

807
01:48:26,233 --> 01:48:27,803
I dropped the PDA...

808
01:48:27,968 --> 01:48:30,448
"Don't worry, it's here."

809
01:48:33,306 --> 01:48:34,478
Hang in there.

810
01:49:33,333 --> 01:49:35,574
Sean! He's here!

811
01:50:18,011 --> 01:50:19,081
JOn!

812
01:50:19,779 --> 01:50:21,087
Get ready to do your bitch!

813
01:50:23,083 --> 01:50:24,118
Come out!

814
01:50:33,159 --> 01:50:34,331
"Hang in there, brother."

815
01:50:35,295 --> 01:50:36,569
We still have a chance.

816
01:50:48,875 --> 01:50:51,082
"Yeung, Sean shoots too fast."

817
01:50:51,277 --> 01:50:54,121
"The only way is, we both go out together."

818
01:50:54,347 --> 01:50:56,258
"When he shoots one of us,"

819
01:50:56,816 --> 01:50:59,160
the other will have a chance to shoot him.

820
01:51:01,855 --> 01:51:05,166
"Remember, I told you, we're very tough."

821
01:51:15,268 --> 01:51:18,078
I've had the same dream almost every night.

822
01:51:18,304 --> 01:51:21,046
Our whole family was at sea...

823
01:51:21,141 --> 01:51:23,553
One by one you'd disappear.

824
01:51:24,010 --> 01:51:27,457
"In the end, only I was left."

825
01:52:39,152 --> 01:52:40,096
Brother

826
01:52:59,139 --> 01:53:02,143
That feeling is back.

827
01:53:03,009 --> 01:53:06,786
I finally know who reached out
and saved me in my dream.

828
01:53:09,149 --> 01:53:10,856
We've been apart for over two decades...

829
01:53:11,885 --> 01:53:13,922
But he never left me.

830
01:54:20,019 --> 01:54:21,020
Yeung

831
01:54:22,255 --> 01:54:24,360
I know you will not forgive me.

832
01:54:25,358 --> 01:54:28,362
I cannot forgive myself.

833
01:54:30,063 --> 01:54:33,340
I called your father selfish

834
01:54:34,067 --> 01:54:38,914
"but in the end, so was I."

835
01:54:39,839 --> 01:54:45,414
"lfl had the chance to choose again,"

836
01:54:48,114 --> 01:54:52,062
I would never leave you.

837
01:54:55,955 --> 01:54:58,231
It is right that you don't forgive me

838
01:54:58,791 --> 01:55:02,034
but I beg you to accept
your younger brother.

839
01:55:02,996 --> 01:55:05,977
Do you remember? When you were kids...

840
01:55:06,299 --> 01:55:08,074
You loved him very much.

841
01:55:08,434 --> 01:55:12,246
I didn't have the courage to tell him

842
01:55:13,139 --> 01:55:15,813
that it was me who separated the two of you.

843
01:55:16,075 --> 01:55:19,522
I caused your father to lose a son.

844
01:55:24,884 --> 01:55:26,557
It's all my fault.

845
01:55:28,554 --> 01:55:30,033
I'm sorry.

846
01:55:33,326 --> 01:55:34,430
I am old.

847
01:55:36,329 --> 01:55:37,501
I may never

848
01:55:39,232 --> 01:55:41,473
have the chance to see you again.

849
01:55:43,369 --> 01:55:45,110
I just want you to know...

850
01:55:45,972 --> 01:55:48,213
"Since you are now a father,"

851
01:55:49,008 --> 01:55:53,548
I hope you will make plans for your child.

852
01:55:53,947 --> 01:55:56,325
You must take the path you
were meant to take.

853
01:55:56,449 --> 01:55:58,326
Don't be like me...

854
01:55:59,285 --> 01:56:01,424
Or you will regret it all your life.

855
01:56:05,792 --> 01:56:07,066
Take care of yourself.

856
01:56:23,009 --> 01:56:24,545
Mom...

857
01:56:59,979 --> 01:57:02,789
"Champ, come."

858
01:57:07,353 --> 01:57:10,357
Dad has made mistakes which
I've never faced.

859
01:57:12,325 --> 01:57:15,272
I'm going to own up to them.
I'll be back soon.

860
01:57:19,298 --> 01:57:21,938
"Stay with grandma from now on,
understand?"

861
01:57:25,104 --> 01:57:26,242
Meet your grandma.

862
01:57:28,107 --> 01:57:29,108
Grandma.

863
01:57:29,342 --> 01:57:30,412
Good girl.

864
01:57:35,314 --> 01:57:36,793
Where's Jon'?

865
01:57:47,360 --> 01:57:49,897
"When you leave this world,"

866
01:57:50,897 --> 01:57:52,399
the people in your heart

867
01:57:54,100 --> 01:57:55,841
will continue the journey with you

868
01:57:57,837 --> 01:57:59,373
"You will always have them,"

869
01:58:00,973 --> 01:58:02,953
even though they may not be with you.

870
01:58:06,946 --> 01:58:10,553
"If I can only choose
one kind of '"'forever"","

871
01:58:14,320 --> 01:58:18,860
" And, they are my "forever"."
