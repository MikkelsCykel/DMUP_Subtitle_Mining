00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,036
(bird hoots)

2
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,433
Norman! Come here! Come here!

3
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,516
Norman!

4
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,796
Hurry up! The loons!

5
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,112
The loons!

6
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,430
They're welcoming us back.

7
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,396
I don't hear a thing.

8
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,436
Just look at this place!

9
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,876
- It's a mess, isn't it?
- Just take a second.

10
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,394
It'll be all shipshape again.

11
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,436
And warmer!

12
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,398
Hah!

13
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,276
Phone works!

14
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,316
At least, I think it does.

15
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,432
Hello!

16
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,632
Hello?

17
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,069
Hello!

18
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,476
Who the hell is that?

19
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,068
Who the hell's in this picture here?

20
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,796
Who the hell is it?

21
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,838
Hello? Who's this?

22
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,672
The operator?

23
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,716
Oh, what do you want?

24
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,350
You called, you must want something.

25
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,351
Oh, wait a minute.

26
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,352
I did call you, but you never answered.

27
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,396
Well, how are you?

28
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,436
Yeah, I'm nice.

29
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,398
Listen, this is Norman Thayer Jr.
over on Golden Pond.

30
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,436
I've something I want you to do.

31
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,476
Call me up. Can you do that?

32
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,279
I want to check the phone,
see if it still rings.

33
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,239
Hasn't rung all winter.
May have lost its whatsie.

34
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,276
Do you have my number?

35
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:14,314
I've no idea.
It's got a nine, that's all I know.

36
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,708
It's in the book. You must have a book.

37
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,952
Norman Thayer Jr.

38
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,996
Let's give her a try, shall we?

39
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,953
- Who the hell is that?
- (knock at door)

40
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:43,191
- Someone's at the door!
(Woman) It's me, you old poop!

41
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,636
Well, look at you!

42
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,870
Hm... Look at me.

43
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,391
Quite a sight, aren't l?

44
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,436
Oh, Norman!

45
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,830
It's so beautiful!
Everything's just waking up.

46
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,878
Little tiny birds. Little tiny leaves.

47
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:08,272
I saw a patch of little tiny flowers
over by the old cellar hole.

48
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,430
Uh... I forget what they're called.

49
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,750
Little tiny yellow things!

50
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,999
Well... Want to help me
with the dust covers?

51
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,594
- I don't have anything else to do.
- Come on.

52
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,633
What were you doing out in the woods?

53
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,950
Norman, what do you think I was doing?

54
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,996
I was getting wood!

55
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,878
Hey, I met the nicest couple.

56
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,951
- Mm? Where?
- In the woods.

57
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,996
A couple of people?

58
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,036
No, a couple of antelope.

59
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,475
Of course a couple of people!

60
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,835
Their name is Migliore, I believe.

61
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,876
Migliore? What sort of name is that?

62
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:46,589
I don't know, darling.
Italian, I suppose. They're up from Boston.

63
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,638
- Do they speak English?
- Of course they do!

64
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,314
They're a nice middle-aged couple.
Just like us.

65
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,039
If they're just like us,
they're not middle-aged.

66
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,237
- Of course they are!
- Middle age means the middle of life.

67
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,276
People don't live to be 1 50.

68
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,273
Well,... we're at the far edge
of middle age, that's all.

69
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,318
We're not, you know.
You're old and I'm ancient.

70
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,799
Oh, pooh!

71
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,714
- You're in your 70s and I'm in my 60s.
- Barely on both counts!

72
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,917
Do you want to spend the rest of the day
quibbling about this?

73
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,592
We can if you like.

74
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,591
For the Lord's sake!

75
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,515
The Migliores, whatever their age group,
have invited us to dinner sometime.

76
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,431
Wouldn't that be nice?

77
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:30,593
I don't know. I'm not sure
my stomach's ready for rigatoni.

78
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,591
Oh, no!

79
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:36,116
Poor Elmer! He's had a terrible fall!

80
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,873
Poor little Elmer, the life you've led.

81
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,997
He was my first true love, you know.

82
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,799
Known all along I wasn't the first in line.

83
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,395
No, you were a rather cheap
substitute for Elmer.

84
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,836
- And now he's had a fall.
- Maybe he wanted to kill himself.

85
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,071
He's probably got cancer
or termites or something.

86
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,118
- Shut up, Norman!
- Not a bad way to go, huh?

87
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:03,194
A quick front flip off the mantel, a bit of
a kick and end up in the fire. Nothing to it.

88
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,829
- Norman, will you shut up?
- When my number's up, do that for me.

89
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,639
Prop me up on the mantel
and point out which way is down.

90
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,075
I might try for a full gainer
with a half twist.

91
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,072
Norman Thayer Jr,
your fascination with dying...

92
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,515
..is beginning to frazzle my good humour.

93
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,319
Not fascination.
It crosses my mind now and then.

94
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,312
Don't you have anything else
to think about?

95
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,356
Nothing quite as interesting.

96
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,195
What's stopping you? Why don't you
take your dive and get it over with?

97
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,236
And leave you alone with Elmer?

98
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,799
You must be mad!

99
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,836
(laughs)
For pity's sake!

100
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,037
Come on, help me
get the canoe off the porch.

101
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,836
Norman, are you paddling?

102
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,831
Of course I'm paddling.

103
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,876
Then, you're not steering.

104
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,793
- Do you want me to take the stern?
- I certainly do not.

105
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,836
(loons call)

106
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,915
- Norman!
- Good God, what is it?

107
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,679
Oh, look, I've spotted the loons!

108
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,116
Oh, they're so lovely!

109
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,156
Here, here.

110
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,636
Look.

111
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,636
- Can you see them?
- No.

112
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,755
Oh!

113
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,479
Oh, my goodness! There they are.

114
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,710
Oh, they're so beautiful!

115
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,079
They're huge.
I never saw such big loons in my life.

116
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,116
Those are boats, you poop!

117
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,555
Come in closer.

118
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,475
(Woman)
A husband and wife.

119
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,790
I think they're looking at us.

120
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,836
Yeah, they are.

121
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,993
What the hell's the matter with them?

122
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,596
Hey, buzz off!

123
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,193
Buzz off!

124
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,953
- Ethel, what are you doing?
- What do you mean?

125
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,156
- Don't do that!
- Why not? You did it.

126
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,196
Never mind, I'll explain later.

127
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,196
(Ethel laughs)

128
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,317
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11!

129
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,155
How about that? Right on your man!

130
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,798
Where were you?

131
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,919
Where was l?
Oh, come off it! Don't give me that.

132
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,719
- 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10...
- Damn!

133
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,712
Yes, damn it! Good night, sweet prince.

134
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,076
5, 10, 1 5... and 20.

135
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,951
- Well, mother!
- (Ethel laughs)

136
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,589
Do you want to stay and watch the boat
while I run into the store?

137
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,750
I think I'm qualified to watch the boat.

138
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,798
- Come with me if you want to.
- No, thank you very much.

139
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,030
- Hello, Sumner.
- Morning, Mrs Thayer.

140
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,156
- Will you fill her up, please?
- Sure.

141
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,037
Norman will help you.

142
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,269
That'll be $38, please, Mr Thayer.

143
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,353
God... Do you know how much
gasoline cost when I was your age?

144
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,396
12 cents a gallon.

145
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,631
Is that a fact?
I didn't know they had gas back then.

146
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,113
What are you? A couple of nitwits?

147
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,156
Think it's funny being old?

148
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,959
My whole goddamn body's falling apart!

149
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,952
Sometimes I can't even
go to the bathroom when I want to.

150
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,190
But I can still take on both you punks...

151
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,236
Norman! Here we go.

152
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,876
Thanks, boys.

153
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,516
I'll drive home.

154
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,156
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

155
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:39,469
If I make the wrong turn
and wind up in Michigan, let me know.

156
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,515
(knock at door)

157
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,556
Someone's at the door!

158
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,279
(Ethel)
It's me, you old poop!

159
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,558
- Where have you been?
- Picking strawberries.

160
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:09,997
There were oodles of little strawberries
along the old town road.

161
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:14,232
What on earth you're doing in here
on a morning like this is beyond me!

162
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,313
I've been busy looking through
yesterday's paper for gainful employment.

163
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,472
- Here we go again.
- Very good prospects, I think.

164
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:27,112
Chauffeurs, yard work.
Dairy Divine wants a... ice cream dipper.

165
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,516
I think I could do
something like that, don't you?

166
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:35,594
What are you gonna do if you call and
they say, ''Come and start tomorrow''?

167
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,513
- I'll start tomorrow.
- Oh, for the love of God!

168
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,956
Norman, what on earth's
the matter with you?

169
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,996
Look, give me that stuff.

170
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:47,629
Take these buckets and go pick us
another quart of strawberries...

171
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,156
..and I'll fix us a scrumptious
strawberry shortcake for lunch.

172
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,593
Go on!

173
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:57,629
- You want me to pick strawberries?
- Yep. Do I have to put an ad in the paper?

174
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,359
I'm not sure I know
how to pick strawberries.

175
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:03,273
It's very simple.
You bend over and you pick 'em.

176
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,316
Bend over? Where are they?

177
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,595
On the ground, where they belong.

178
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,036
We picked blueberries on a bush.
We didn't have to bend over.

179
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,873
- Strawberries grow on the ground.
- (boat horn)

180
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,633
Oh. Here comes whatshisname.

181
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,676
He'll have the paper, you know.

182
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:22,275
I can't miss any career opportunities
off picking strawberries.

183
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:25,670
I'll pay you, Norman.
It may be the beginning of something big.

184
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,433
You may become
a major strawberry picker.

185
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,511
Not if I'm bending over all the time.

186
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,637
- I think you're trying to kill me.
- I've thought about it.

187
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,075
Don't bother.
I'm living on borrowed time.

188
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,789
Will you take your cheery personality
and get out of here?

189
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,952
I hope you'll massage
my bent back this evening.

190
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,996
With pleasure.

191
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:49,599
Well, maybe I can...
lie down to pick the berries.

192
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,830
- Morning, Ethel!
- Hi, Charlie!

193
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:04,111
Come and have some coffee.
You can take five minutes.

194
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,836
You got a letter from Chelsea!

195
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,714
- The rest is just bills and junk like that.
- Sure. Go on in.

196
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,034
Ohh!

197
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,111
Uh-oh! I think I broke your door.

198
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,509
No, no. It's been that way for months.

199
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:26,628
Norman's supposed to fix it,
but it's not high on his list of priorities.

200
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,676
(breathes heavily)

201
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,996
(panting)

202
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,432
Hi, Norman.

203
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,677
Norman, are you back already?
You barely left!

204
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,716
So? I move fast.

205
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,234
Ran all the way
and picked without stopping.

206
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,392
- Let me see what you got.
- I'll just dump 'em in with yours.

207
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,790
Not a single berry!
What's the matter with you?

208
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,916
Must have eaten them all.

209
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,916
No mail today, Charlie?

210
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,151
Holy Mackinoly, I left it on the porch.

211
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,437
How about bringing it in?
Can you do that?

212
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,476
You bet!

213
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,235
- Glass of milk, Norman?
- No.

214
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,873
I see you broke the screen door, Charlie.

215
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,919
It's just missing
its little thingamabobbers for the hinges.

216
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,515
- I could bring you a couple tomorrow.
- Just be careful next time.

217
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,477
Here it is, Norman.

218
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,994
- Drink it.
- Thank you, nurse.

219
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,554
Finish your coffee over here.

220
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,316
There you go.

221
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,595
- What you got there, Norman?
- I have no idea, I can't open it.

222
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,716
Here, bite this, please.

223
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,236
Oh, just his medicine.

224
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,959
Oh, goody. What a swell surprise!

225
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,713
Nothing serious, just for his palpitations.

226
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,712
That's right.
I have occasional heart-throbs.

227
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,314
Norman, we got a letter from Chelsea.

228
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,597
Look at the goddamn Orioles!

229
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,717
Baltimore's always been a sneaky town.

230
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,153
Norman!

231
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,191
She's coming for your birthday.

232
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:55,272
- Oh? How nice.
- Yep.

233
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,669
And she's bringing a friend.

234
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,399
She has the nicest boyfriend!

235
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,515
Oh?

236
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,831
They're coming together,
then they're going on to Europe.

237
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:09,869
Oh, really? I don't want crowds of people
coming on my birthday,...

238
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,916
..watching me turn older.

239
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,836
Wait a minute. It's not that Freddie person.
This is a different boyfriend altogether!

240
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,876
What the hell's going on?

241
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:23,236
Detroit's disappeared! Good God!

242
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:26,118
- What is it, Norman?
- Detroit's gone!

243
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,237
What happened to her husband?

244
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,671
What is it, Charlie?

245
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,149
What happened to Chelsea's husband?

246
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,196
He didn't work out.

247
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,996
Hey...

248
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,236
She's...
(laughs)

249
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,359
She says...
She says she's in love with a dentist.

250
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,556
Does her boyfriend know about this?

251
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,155
This is her new boyfriend.
Her new boyfriend is a dentist.

252
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,754
That's who she's bringing here, a dentist?

253
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,750
Yep.

254
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,196
Good God, he'll be staring at our teeth
all the time!

255
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,113
Well, should we ask him not to come?

256
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:09,479
No, we should have representatives from
all walks of life at my last birthday party.

257
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:15,476
Oh, lorks! I think this medicine
should be put away from all this hot air.

258
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:20,914
- Why didn't you marry Chelsea?
- You wouldn't let me.

259
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,595
No? If you'd have married somebody else,
I'd have allowed that.

260
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,830
I didn't want anyone else!

261
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,596
How old will you be?

262
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,636
- When?
- On your birthday.

263
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,676
103.

264
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:41,592
Miss Appley was 97 in May.
Isn't that amazing?

265
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,591
Yeah.

266
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,716
- She died, you know.
- No.

267
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:50,430
Yeah. Last Tuesday.
We got a call in case any mail comes up.

268
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,518
Gave you a forwarding address
for Miss Appley?

269
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,836
(Ethel)
What's so funny?

270
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,876
One of the lesbians expired.

271
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,712
- (Charlie laughs)
- Oh, no.

272
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,268
- Which one, Charlie?
- Miss Appley.

273
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,275
Well, she had a good full life.

274
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,828
Charlie said she was 97.

275
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,639
97! Isn't that wonderful?

276
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,029
Puts us all to shame, doesn't it?

277
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:19,317
There's something to be said
for a deviant lifestyle.

278
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,834
(Charlie)
Well, thanks for the coffee.

279
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,549
You still make
the best biscuits on the lake.

280
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,119
Thank you, Charlie.

281
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,350
You must come round
when Chelsea comes.

282
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,637
- Hey, I haven't seen her in a long time.
- No.

283
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,915
- Well...
- Norman.

284
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,228
Charlie's leaving.

285
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,276
Good. Bye.

286
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,436
Goodbye.

287
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,274
Watch out for that screen door.

288
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:01,079
Norman!
The loons are teaching their baby to fly.

289
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,196
Isn't that exciting?

290
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,713
Listen to this.

291
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:11,749
''Retired people sought for handbill
delivery. Some walking involved.''

292
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,796
I should call. I can walk.

293
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,394
Is that why you came rushing back here?

294
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,630
To read those goddamned ads?

295
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,633
You wanna know
why I came back so fast?

296
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,035
I got to the end of our lane...

297
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:37,237
I couldn't remember
where the old town road was.

298
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,550
I went a little way into the woods.

299
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,438
There was nothing familiar.
Not one damn tree.

300
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,476
Scared me half to death.

301
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,229
That's why I came...
running back here to you.

302
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,878
To see your pretty face.

303
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:56,472
I could feel safe, I was still me.

304
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,390
You're safe, you old poop.

305
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,117
And you're definitely still you,...

306
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,080
..picking on poor old Charlie.

307
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,876
After lunch,...

308
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:28,878
..after we've gobbled up
all those silly strawberries,...

309
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,589
..we'll take ourselves to the old town road.

310
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:35,638
We've been there
a thousand times, darling.

311
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,792
A thousand.

312
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,110
And you'll remember it all.

313
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,396
Listen to me, mister.

314
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,678
You're my knight in shining armour.

315
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,716
Don't you forget it.

316
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,633
You're gonna get back on that horse...

317
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,679
..and I'm gonna be right behind you,
holding on tight.

318
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,194
And away we're gonna go, go, go.

319
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,476
I don't like horses.

320
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,237
You are a... pretty old dame, aren't you?

321
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,636
What are you doing with
a dotty old son of a bitch like me?

322
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,756
Well,...

323
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,229
..l haven't the vaguest idea.

324
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,150
(Ethel hoots)

325
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,549
Yoo ho hohooha!

326
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,278
(loons call)

327
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,351
Yoo ho hohooha!

328
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,351
(loons call)

329
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,317
Hooha ho!

330
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:07,075
I don't think you should do that
in front of Chelsea's companion.

331
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,115
Oh, pooh!

332
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,839
I was just talking to my friends.

333
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,876
Hey, look at you!

334
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,916
My, oh my! You have on a tie!

335
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,309
Yes, I know. I put it there.

336
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,437
Do I look all right?
I haven't overdressed, have l?

337
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,431
You look sexy.

338
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:26,115
I'm gonna have to do some fast
manoeuvres to catch up with you.

339
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,795
I have some other ties.
You could come as Miss Appley.

340
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,278
Thank you!

341
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,190
''Welcome home, Chelsea.''

342
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:59,478
I see my birthday party
wasn't cause enough for celebration.

343
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:03,314
I just wanted our little girl
to feel welcome, that's all.

344
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,949
Norman.

345
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:10,397
Wouldn't it be nice
if we could all get along this time?

346
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,754
Hm.

347
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,515
Where the hell are they?
I'm getting older by the minute.

348
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,034
They said they'd be here
when they get here.

349
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,031
- Is that what they said?
- Yup.

350
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,076
That's a hell of an attitude.

351
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,799
No wonder we don't have
any grandchildren!

352
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:29,271
- What would we do with grandchildren?
- Toss them on our knee.

353
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,590
We're the last of the Thayers, you know.

354
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,989
End of the line for a damn good name.

355
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,516
Yup. And we're gonna take it out in style.

356
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,953
(car horn)

357
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,393
Oh, my...

358
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,596
They're here and I'm not even dressed.

359
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:46,229
- I look like an old character.
- You are an old character.

360
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:50,793
Go on upstairs and change
if it will make you feel any better.

361
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,030
- Be nice to them!
- Sure.

362
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:58,117
I'll explain the risks involved in being late
to an old man's birthday party.

363
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,156
(Woman)
Anybody home?

364
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,196
Too late. Look.

365
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:05,078
Move that flower vase
to the other side of the table.

366
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:09,233
- Why?
- Just do it! For once, just do it!

367
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:16,870
Hey! Oh, Mommy!

368
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,871
Oh, darling!

369
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,916
What a treat! Let me look at you.

370
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,353
Oh, you're great!

371
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:25,113
- Where is he?
- Just inside the door. Go in.

372
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,156
He's waiting for you.

373
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,156
Hello, Norman.

374
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,679
- Well, look at you!
- Happy birthday.

375
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,479
Look at this little fat girl.

376
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,632
Oh, Norman!

377
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,676
You're as thin as a rail.

378
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,076
- Isn't she?
- Sure.

379
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:53,311
My darling, I'm so glad you're home.

380
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,868
- Give me these things.
- I didn't think we'd make it.

381
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,190
We rented a car
that explodes every 40 miles.

382
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,191
- Rented a car?
- In Boston.

383
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,236
What sort of car is it?

384
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,156
I don't know.

385
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,515
- Green, I think.
- Ooh! A green car.

386
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,989
I meant what sort of make is it.

387
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,629
- I don't know.
- She doesn't know, Norman.

388
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:17,508
- It doesn't matter.
- Of course it doesn't. I was just curious.

389
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,556
Well, I guess I should have looked.

390
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:23,474
Let's see.
It's very ugly and it breaks down a lot.

391
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,790
Ugly and breaks down.

392
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,991
Sounds like a Nash.

393
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,036
Yes, well...

394
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,839
Where... Where's your friend?
You did bring your friend, didn't you?

395
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,070
I knew I was forgetting something.

396
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,913
- That's still on, huh?
- As far as I know.

397
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,198
Come on in. No-one's gonna bite you.

398
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,236
Mommy, Norman, this is Billy Ray.

399
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,316
(Ethel)
Oh!

400
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,996
How are you doing?

401
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,595
You seem awfully young to be a dentist.

402
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,636
This is Billy Ray Jr.

403
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,757
Oh. I'm Norman Thayer Jr. Where's...

404
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,876
His father is trying to park the car.

405
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:07,114
This is a great surprise. You can call me
Ethel and you can call Norman Norman.

406
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,156
(laughs)
I like your logic, Mommy.

407
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,595
I'll go see if Bill has driven into the lake.

408
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,636
I'll put away some of these things.

409
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,356
I hear you turned 80 today.

410
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:23,398
- Is that what you heard?
- Yeah.

411
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,236
Man, that's really old.

412
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,959
You should meet my father.

413
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:32,999
- Your father's still alive?
- No, but you should meet him.

414
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,798
Isn't this fun!

415
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,792
Norman, let's put Billy
in Chelsea's old room.

416
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,314
Then he can look out
at the lake in the morning.

417
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,836
Let's put him out on the float.
He can look at it all night long.

418
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:47,515
- I'd like that.
- You'd be eaten alive by all the bugs.

419
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,433
- So?
- Norman, take him up.

420
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:53,273
- Show him where everything is.
- Come on, boy.

421
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,632
I just had a birthday, too.
I turned 13 two weeks ago.

422
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,029
Oh? We're practically twins.

423
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,795
I'm so glad you're here!

424
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,236
He'll be right in. He actually thinks
you have to lock your car.

425
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,834
Mommy... Norman looks so old.

426
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,636
Oh, I don't know...

427
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,676
You look great, though.

428
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,236
Thank you. So do you.

429
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,550
- I love your hair.
- Thanks.

430
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,552
How's his mind?
Is he remembering things better?

431
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:34,996
- Is he...
- Oh, he's all right. He's all right!

432
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,991
Come on, Billy!

433
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:41,073
I'll show you the bathroom,
if I can remember where it is.

434
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,676
Well, at least he hasn't changed.

435
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:49,794
No. He's still impossible. It means
so much to him to have you here.

436
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,155
Sure. Now he's got
someone he can pick on.

437
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,959
Oh, come on. Thank you for coming.

438
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,996
Thank you for inviting me.

439
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,036
(man)
Chels!

440
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,314
Well, you've finally made it!

441
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,868
- This is my mother. This is Bill Ray.
- Hi.

442
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:10,071
- I think I saw a bear.
- You couldn't have at this time of year.

443
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:13,596
There are some rather nasty moths
flying around, though.

444
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,035
No, no, this was a little big for a moth.

445
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:19,032
If you really wanna be scared,
wait till you meet my father.

446
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,190
- Hey, Dad!
- Hey, Billy!

447
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:24,033
Dad, they do have indoor plumbing here.

448
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,189
Oh, great!

449
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,236
Chelsea was just bullshitting us.

450
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:30,232
I like to paint a rustic picture
of life on Golden Pond.

451
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,356
Ooh, it's rustic, all right!

452
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:35,432
It's lovely, though. Lovely rusticity.

453
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:38,637
We've been peeing indoors for 40 years.

454
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,076
- You must be Norman.
- Yeah, must be! Who are you?

455
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,912
- Bill Ray.
- Bill Ray.

456
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,399
- The dentist?
- Yes, sir.

457
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,948
- Want to see my teeth?
- (chuckling)

458
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,077
I'd just like to tell you, sir,
how glad we are to be here.

459
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:56,756
Chelsea's told me so much
about you and your lovely wife.

460
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,876
We're pleased she's brought us here.

461
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,349
I'm surprised Chelsea could find the way.

462
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,716
Well, she's here, Norman,
and that's what's important.

463
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,631
Do you visit your parents?

464
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,598
No, sir. My parents both passed away.

465
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,875
I see. Then, you have a good excuse.

466
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,030
(Chelsea)
Norman, please.

467
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,872
(Ethel)
Norman! Why...

468
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,679
Am I not allowed to speak to our guests?
Is that it?

469
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,354
They're afraid
I'm gonna embarrass them.

470
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,840
Well, I'm gonna go say hello to the lake.

471
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,672
Anybody coming?

472
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,512
Uh... me.

473
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,194
I've never seen anyone
say hello to a lake before.

474
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,430
- Mommy, you coming?
- Yeah.

475
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:37,034
(Ethel)
Want to take the boat?

476
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,839
- A boat, all right!
- Bill, aren't you coming?

477
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,716
What, outside?

478
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,756
That's where the lake is.

479
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,796
Coming, Norman?

480
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:50,031
No, I think I'll just sit here
and enjoy the quiet.

481
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,839
- I'll stay, too.
- With Bill.

482
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,673
- The screen door's broken.
- Really?

483
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,637
Norman will fix it.

484
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,315
- I love your house.
- Thank you.

485
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,879
It's not for sale.

486
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,835
I don't want to buy it, I just like it.

487
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,876
It has uh...

488
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,516
It has a charming ambience.

489
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,515
Well, how does it feel to turn 80?

490
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,512
Twice as bad as it did turning 40.

491
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,636
I know what that's like.

492
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:47,478
I turned 40 five years ago.

493
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,796
45 now.

494
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,796
- Norman.
- Huh?

495
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,950
Do you mind if I call you Norman?

496
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,874
- I believe you just did.
- I don't want to press.

497
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,710
What should I call your wife?

498
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,159
How about Ethel? That's her name.

499
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,832
Ethel Thayer.

500
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:20,072
Thoundth like I'm lithping, doethn't it?
Ethel Thayer.

501
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,310
Almost kept her from marrying me.

502
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,630
Wanted me to change
my last name to hers.

503
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,711
- What was that?
- I don't remember.

504
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,395
Well.

505
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,432
Well...

506
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,751
I think I'll... start a new book.

507
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,152
See if I can finish it
before I'm finished myself.

508
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:50,110
Maybe a novelette. Maybe something
from 'Reader's Digest' abridged.

509
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,309
Here's 'Treasure lsland'.

510
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,118
- Ever read it?
- Oh, yeah.

511
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,510
That's a great book.
I'd highly recommend that one.

512
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,114
No need for that. I've read it myself.

513
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:05,591
But my mind is going, so...
it'll all be new to me.

514
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,155
That son of yours ever read this book?

515
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,676
I don't think so.

516
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,994
Your son hasn't read
Treasure lsland?

517
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:20,311
No, but I intend to have him read it.

518
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,278
His mother's been the real force
in his life lately.

519
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:26,113
But l... I intend to eradicate...

520
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:29,988
..some of the... dishevelment.

521
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,196
Actually, uh...

522
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,511
Actually, things are...

523
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:43,398
..coming together
very nicely for me lately.

524
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:46,472
I'm beginning to feel
very good about myself.

525
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,196
Meeting...

526
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,510
Meeting Chelsea was a major...

527
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,636
..thing.

528
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,556
We have a...

529
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,596
We have a very kinetic relationship.

530
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:04,116
It's very positive.
I'm sure you'd be pleased.

531
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,634
- What do you charge for a filling?
- Hm?

532
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,314
You're a dentist.
What do you charge for a filling?

533
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,153
Oh, it's generally $40.

534
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,470
$40? Good God!

535
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,436
Norman.

536
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,596
We'd like to sleep together if...

537
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,796
..if, you know, it's all right with you.

538
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,711
What do you mean?

539
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,756
We'd...

540
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:42,310
We'd like to sleep together
in the same room.

541
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,038
Same... same bed.

542
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,270
You know, if it's not offensive to you.

543
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,112
All three of you?

544
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,156
No, just two.

545
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,711
You and Billy?

546
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,558
No.

547
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:58,029
Not Chelsea and Billy?

548
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,473
No.

549
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,199
That leaves Chelsea and you, then.

550
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,393
That's right.

551
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,436
Why would I find that offensive?

552
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,317
You're not...

553
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,358
..planning on doing something unusual,
are you?

554
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:15,159
No, no. No, no, no. Just um...

555
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,196
You know, just...

556
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,592
Ah... Doesn't seem too offensive.
As long as you're quiet.

557
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,352
Thank you.

558
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:27,477
- Chelsea always slept with her husband.
- Yeah, sure.

559
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:30,950
Ethel and I, we sleep together.
Been doing it for years.

560
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,871
No, I guess I'd be...

561
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:37,511
..delighted to have you
abuse my daughter under my own roof.

562
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:40,637
Would you like the room
where I first violated her mother?

563
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,836
Or would you prefer the master bedroom?

564
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,309
Ethel, your boy and I
could sleep out back.

565
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,914
You could do it in the hearth.
Like that idea?

566
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,830
You're having a good time, aren't you?

567
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:54,955
Huh?

568
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:59,556
Chelsea told me all about how you like
to have a good time with people's heads.

569
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,676
She does too, sometimes.

570
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,436
Sometimes I can get into it...

571
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,476
..but sometimes not.

572
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:10,633
I think you should know I'm pretty good
at recognising crap when I hear it.

573
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:15,517
You know, it's not imperative
that you and I become friends.

574
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,034
But I thought it would be nice.

575
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:23,033
I'm sure you're a very fascinating person.

576
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:26,669
And I thought it would be fascinating
getting to know you.

577
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,434
That's obviously not an easy task.

578
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,870
You just go ahead and be...

579
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,360
..as poopy as you want, to quote Chelsea.

580
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,830
And I'll be as receptive and as pleasant
as I can be.

581
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,150
But I want you to bear one thing in mind...

582
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:50,789
..while you're jerking me around,
making me feel like an asshole.

583
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,235
I know precisely what you're up to.

584
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,914
And I'll take just so much of it.

585
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,275
OK?

586
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:03,957
What is the bottom line
on this illicit sex question?

587
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,873
Very good! That was a good speech.

588
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,592
Bottom line. You're a bottom-line man.

589
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,474
All right, here's the bottom line.

590
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,312
OK.

591
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,389
Hm?

592
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,436
You seem like a nice man.

593
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,988
Bit verbose, but nice.

594
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:27,868
And you're right about me.
I am fascinating.

595
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:31,032
Let's get back to sex.
Anything you want to know, just ask me.

596
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,076
No, I just um...

597
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:37,190
I just wanted to clear up
that little question.

598
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,192
Chelsea and I can sleep together, right?

599
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,032
Sure, please do!

600
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,149
Just don't let Ethel catch you.

601
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,799
(door opens)

602
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:51,236
Dad! Dad! I paddled the canoe!

603
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,880
A canoe! It's a boat!
Just like the lndians had.

604
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:57,475
Actually, the lndians used
a different grade of aluminum.

605
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,516
Chelsea wants you to come to the lake.

606
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:03,070
- She and Ethel are going skinny dipping!
- Skinny dipping?

607
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:07,233
Go ahead, permissiveness
runs rampant here on Golden Pond.

608
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,276
Let's go.

609
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,551
Oh, um...

610
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,551
Are there any bears around here?

611
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:18,313
Oh, sure. Black bears and grizzlies.

612
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,790
One came along here last month
and ate an old lesbian.

613
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,276
Dad, come on.

614
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,590
He's just bullshitting. Come on.

615
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,392
Oh, yeah!

616
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,631
- Hey! Where are you going?
- Skinny dipping with Chelsea.

617
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:36,792
No, no. You're going back inside
and talk to Mr Thayer.

618
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,233
Bullshit!

619
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:41,676
Dad, I'm not going in there
with that old turkey man. He's creepy.

620
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,716
What if he dies?

621
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,676
Now, listen to me.

622
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:51,356
If you don't behave yourself, I'm gonna
send you right back to your mother.

623
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,396
Is that what you want?

624
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:58,353
Now go back in there and talk to him.
Maybe you'll learn something.

625
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,236
Go on, go on!

626
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,636
(laughing)

627
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:17,629
Remember when I was nine years old and
I caught you and Norman skinny dipping?

628
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,676
No. I don't remember that.

629
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,751
Don't you remember I had that big light?

630
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:24,718
I shone it on Norman on the diving board
and he was naked!

631
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:29,555
He screamed at me. He called me a spy
and sent me to my room for a year.

632
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,596
It took me so long to get over that.

633
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:35,639
It took Norman a long time before
he could go skinny dipping again.

634
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:40,350
He wouldn't even get out of the water until
I went up and made sure you were asleep.

635
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:44,040
I was so bloody mad at him
for yelling at you...

636
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:47,476
..that I let him float around
down here for an hour or so,...

637
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:49,516
..freezing to death.

638
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,033
(laughs)
Good!

639
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,356
Are you going skinny dipping?

640
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,315
Huh?

641
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,109
- Are you going skinny dipping?
- Nah. You?

642
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,876
Nah.

643
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:10,114
I try to be selective about
who I flash in front of, you know?

644
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,156
Oh?

645
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:19,478
Chelsea says
you're a real heavy-duty fisherman.

646
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:22,199
She calls you The Old Man Of The Sea.

647
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,716
Aaah, I've caught a few.

648
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,236
You fish?

649
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:31,276
Nah.

650
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:35,640
What do you do out there in California?

651
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:42,592
I mean, what does one do for recreation
when one is 13 and not at school?

652
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,116
We... cruise chicks.

653
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:49,229
- Mm?
- Cruise chicks.

654
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:51,550
You know, meet 'em. Girls.

655
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:53,710
Try to pick 'em up.

656
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,916
What do you do with 'em
when you have 'em?

657
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:58,876
Suck face.

658
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,436
I beg your pardon?

659
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:05,557
You know, kiss. Suck face, you kiss.

660
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,155
Ever read this book
Treasure lsland?

661
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:12,195
No.

662
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,838
Go read it.

663
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:15,798
Now?

664
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:19,634
Take it upstairs! Read chapter one.
Give me a report in the morning.

665
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,515
I thought you said
we were gonna have a party.

666
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:28,832
I'll call you when the party's under way...
if it ever is. Go on!

667
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:41,715
(gasps)

668
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,756
Oh, I... I'm sorry.

669
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,956
Chelsea's still in the water.

670
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,237
You should go on down.
No-one should skinny-dip alone.

671
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,398
Uh... Oh um...

672
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:55,436
- Yes?
- What uh...

673
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:58,036
What is that over there?

674
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:01,676
That's a lawn chair.

675
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,636
(chuckles)

676
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,313
Go on!

677
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,039
- Right down to the pond.
- Right. See you later.

678
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:23,148
I thought you'd be nude.
(chuckles)

679
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:25,196
No. Sorry.

680
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:29,031
I didn't want to overwhelm our guest
on his first night.

681
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,076
He's nice, isn't he?

682
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:33,958
- Hm. $40 a filling.
- $40!

683
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:36,190
That's enough to keep you off sweets.

684
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:39,036
He'd be a good catch, wouldn't he?

685
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:43,750
- He said they wanted to sleep together.
- Well, why not? They're big people.

686
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:45,193
Yeah.

687
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:48,917
You and I did, didn't we?

688
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:53,198
- Did we?
- Oh, Norman!

689
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,196
Have you been picking on him?

690
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:59,352
Yeah. He finds me fascinating.
(laughs)

691
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,316
Well, why not?

692
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,032
Norman.

693
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:09,316
- Norman.
- Hm?

694
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:14,071
Chelsea... wants us to do something...
for her.

695
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:18,835
She wants to leave Billy here
with us for a month.

696
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:21,358
Which Billy?

697
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:24,512
Oh, Billy, Norman! The little one.

698
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:27,194
Bill is supposed to have him
for the summer.

699
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:30,238
The kid would be miserable in Europe.

700
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:32,356
Bill seems very nice and...

701
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:36,433
..Chels needs someone nice.
Couldn't we do that for her?

702
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:40,149
What would we do with the boy?
What would I say to him?

703
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,196
Oh, you'd think of something.

704
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:43,315
Let's do it!

705
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:47,598
Let's say we'll do it
and give Chelsea some happiness. Yes?

706
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:51,076
All right.

707
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,754
The three of us will have
a splendid time, won't we?

708
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:55,796
I dunno. We might.

709
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,396
You know, Norman,...

710
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:02,155
..you really are
the sweetest man in the world.

711
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,629
But I'm the only one who knows it.

712
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:10,956
-  Happy birthday to you
- (all join in)

713
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:15,313
 Happy birthday to you

714
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:20,394
 Happy birthday, dear Norman

715
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:27,788
 Happy birthday to you

716
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:29,836
(Billy)
And many more!

717
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:34,833
I suppose you expect me
to sing something now.

718
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,956
Well,... I'm not about to.

719
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:41,838
I've been trying all day to draw some...

720
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:46,038
..profound conclusion about
living four score years.

721
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:48,270
I haven't thought of anything.

722
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:50,669
I'm surprised I got here so fast.

723
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:55,439
But I'm... glad I got to spend
so much time with this beautiful woman.

724
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,476
What's your name again?

725
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:02,276
I want to thank all of you for coming
all the way here from Disneyland...

726
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:04,954
..to witness this historic event.

727
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:11,400
Now I'm out of hot air, I'm gonna need
some assistance to get these candles out.

728
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:13,436
Come on, everybody.

729
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:17,033
(Billy)
Whoo!

730
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:37,193
Come on!

731
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:38,554
Chicken.

732
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:50,118
Ohh!

733
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,156
Charlie!

734
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:55,036
Ohh!

735
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,191
Well, holy Mackinoly!

736
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,077
Look at you!

737
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:06,869
- Chelsea Mackinelsea!
- Charlie Mackinarlie!

738
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,996
Boy, it's good to see ya!

739
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:11,036
You've held up good.

740
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:13,076
Thanks, so have you.

741
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:15,833
Bill, this is my old friend, Charlie!

742
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:19,117
- He's the mailman.
- Hi. How are you?

743
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,156
Hello.

744
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:24,198
- Want a ride?
- I'd love one.

745
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:28,558
(Chelsea)
Oh! It's so good to see you!

746
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,436
Great.

747
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:44,832
You actually deliver the mail on a boat!
What an incredible tradition.

748
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:47,195
Oh, Charlie's a legend on this lake.

749
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,874
He gets the mail through, no matter what.

750
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,996
- Right, Charlie?
- Yeah, I guess so.

751
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:54,036
Must be a bitch in the winter, huh?

752
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:56,759
Yeah. In the winter I have a hell of a time!

753
00:50:56,840 --> 00:51:00,913
Course, there's nobody on the lake
to deliver to, so I get done a lot faster.

754
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,831
(laughing)

755
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:05,559
You've got a great setup here.
You're a lucky man.

756
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:07,437
You're a lucky man, too.

757
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:11,036
Yeah, I guess I am.

758
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,716
Um... what uh...

759
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:16,753
What do you usually do
at a time like this?

760
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:19,434
Well, generally I just fall into the lake.

761
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,351
Just uh...

762
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:23,351
(Chelsea laughs)

763
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,158
Whoa!

764
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:37,674
All right, come on, Dad.
Big rolls here. You can beat him. Big rolls.

765
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:40,316
Two threes. What does that mean?

766
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:44,518
That means doubles,
which always means you get 14, you see?

767
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:47,313
You send me home,
you get 20 more, for God's sake!

768
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:49,960
- All right, Dadders!
- Good, huh?

769
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,996
Excellent. You're a natural.

770
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:54,594
I'm starting to regret
teaching you this game.

771
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:57,319
Chels. Hey, Chels. Parcheesi pro.

772
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:59,516
Chelsea doesn't like playing games.

773
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:02,592
We don't know why.
Probably doesn't like losing.

774
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:05,592
I tend to panic
when the competition gets too intense.

775
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:08,069
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

776
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,549
We play serious Parcheesi around here.

777
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:13,712
I let Norman win sometimes
just to keep his spirits up.

778
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:14,755
Ha ha ha!

779
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:18,310
What I'd like to know
is why you enjoy playing games.

780
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,515
Huh?

781
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:22,990
You seem to like beating people.
I wonder why.

782
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:32,074
You got another chance, Bill.
Another roll.
