<i>- This is the story</i>

2
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,960
<i>of the first and last time
I ever fell in love.</i>

3
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,000
<i>Let me start
with a little background</i>

4
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,760
<i>so that you can
understand exactly</i>

5
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,120
what I've been through here.

6
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,040
It's a boy!

7
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,440
<i>- My name is Charles Bellow,</i>

8
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,880
but you can call me Charlie.

9
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,080
<i>I was born
in French Lick, Indiana,</i>

10
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,520
which sounds like it could be

11
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,680
<i>kind of a cool,
scandalous place to be from,</i>

12
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,800
<i>but it's not.</i>

13
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,360
Uh, there's nothing French

14
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,160
<i>and trust me,
nothing is licked.</i>

15
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,880
My parents, Roger and Kitty,

16
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,720
<i>are the nicest people
you'd ever want to meet,</i>

17
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,360
<i>and I'm not just using
an expression there.</i>

18
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,720
<i>If you met people any nicer
than this,</i>

19
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,240
it would just upset you.

20
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,400
- Give the nice
lady a seat.

21
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,400
- OK!
- There you go.

22
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,360
<i>- I was taught to emulate
that niceness,</i>

23
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,600
<i>and to reasonably expect
it from other people.</i>

24
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,960
You can have my seat,
ma'am.

25
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,920
- Thank you, dear.

26
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,360
<i>- Now, that second part there,</i>

27
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,920
uh, that's where you can
get into a little trouble.

28
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,160
<i>When I was accepted at
Vanderweil University,</i>

29
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,400
<i>it was the fulfillment</i>

30
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,320
<i>of a dream my parents
had had since...</i>

31
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,360
- Oh! OK.

32
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,480
OK.

33
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,800
<i>-...well, since
the very beginning.</i>

34
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,960
- All right.

35
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,800
<i>- A Bellow was going to college.</i>

36
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,760
<i>A Bellow was majoring
in business,</i>

37
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,080
so that a Bellow could then
go on to become a middle manager

38
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,000
<i>in a fine
American corporation...</i>

39
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,160
<i>Maybe even
the Tiller King Company,</i>

40
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,920
<i>whose tractors my father
repaired for a living.</i>

41
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,200
<i>I shared their dream.</i>

42
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,080
<i>I promised them
that I would not let them down,</i>

43
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,000
that the Bellow-family boulder
was about to get a serious shove

44
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,480
up the evolutionary hill.

45
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,320
Hi.

46
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,080
Hi.

47
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,880
They were counting on me.

48
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,560
Lord, how they were counting.

49
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,880
Hi.

50
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,560
Hi.

51
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,040
<i>Everything was on track
in my undergraduate years,</i>

52
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,760
<i>and I was lucky enough
to get into business school.</i>

53
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,080
And then I got word that

54
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,080
<i>my cousin Bart
had passed away... suddenly.</i>

55
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,160
- Death, man.

56
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,400
Death sucks.

57
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,320
- Glad you were a
philosophy major there, Leo.

58
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,280
- Sorry. The death unit
was back in freshman year.

59
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,280
Meantime, we should probably
just try to cheer ourselves up

60
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,200
by sticking to
happier subjects...

61
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,520
like sex.

62
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,720
Wanna play the game, huh?

63
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,920
- Sure.

64
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,240
- Yes.

65
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,240
Yes.

66
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,320
Yes.

67
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,440
Yes.

68
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,000
Yes!

69
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,480
Yes.
- OK, OK, OK, OK.

70
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,200
Let's play this way.

71
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,960
Are there any women here
who you would not sleep with?

72
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,960
- Probably.

73
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,280
- Fair enough.

74
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,960
- Charlie, I'm a young male
at or near my sexual peak.

75
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,120
Don't hate me for following
my evolutionary blueprint.

76
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,240
- Oh, I do not.
- Hell, yes!

77
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,640
- I just, uh, I think it's--

78
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,280
I think it's suspect that
you could know in a second

79
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,520
whether or not you
would sleep with a woman.

80
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,720
For me-- For me, those
decisions take a little thought.

81
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,360
- That's why you've only slept
with 3 women in 4 years!

82
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,920
- What, are you taking notes?

83
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,920
- Yes!

84
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,040
- Damn you!

85
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,360
I just have other priorities
right now, you know?

86
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,400
- I mean--
- Whoa! Careful, Charlie!

87
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,520
If the death of your cousin
teaches us anything,

88
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,400
it's that we must live!

89
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,160
Live, Charlie! Live!

90
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,800
- Live, you say.

91
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,760
- Yes!

92
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,720
- Yes.

93
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,000
- Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

94
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,680
Yes!

95
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,400
In your dreams, pervert!

96
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,360
- I mean, you might like it!
It might even be good for you.

97
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,480
- It might.

98
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,080
- I mean, do you
seriously claim

99
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,120
there is no woman within your
field of vision at this moment

100
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,400
with whom you would sleep,
no questions asked?

101
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,880
- Excuse me, but you should be!

102
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,680
- OK, I'm sorry.

103
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,640
- I...

104
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,680
I'm outta here.

105
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,760
- Just go.

106
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,320
- Wow, you open big!

107
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,440
- Yeah, go ahead.

108
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,400
- Course she's hammered...

109
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,920
or not particularly
coordinated,

110
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,080
but very hot.

111
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,080
Good call, Charlie.
Definite "yes".

112
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,840
- I'm not even saying that
I would sleep with her.

113
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,080
- Well, you're staring at her
pretty good.

114
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,560
- I would talk to her.
Uh, I would, uh...

115
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,400
- You would, uh...

116
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,000
- Uh, get to know her.
Um...

117
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,080
- OK!

118
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,560
- You know what? You live
your way, I'll live mine.

119
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,520
- Fine!

120
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,720
- Fine!

121
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,880
- Go begin
to get to know her then.

122
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,680
- Not today. I gotta pay
a condolence call to my aunt.

123
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,680
- Ugh.

124
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,400
- Let her pinch my cheek,

125
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,040
tell me how much
I look like my cousin.

126
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:20,520
Oh! Besides, she actually has
a girl she wants me to meet.

127
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,840
- You see, Charlie?

128
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,240
Everyone you know,
even your bereaved aunt,

129
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,520
is telling you
the same thing.

130
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,760
Live. Yes.

131
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,760
- Thank you.

132
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,480
# Whistle #

133
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,240
- Yes, I'm free
and I'm loving it!

134
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,480
Train, where are you?

135
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,360
Whoo-wee!

136
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,280
Choo-choo!
Choo-choo-choo!

137
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,640
Ah!

138
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,760
- Hey! Hey!

139
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,400
- Get off me!

140
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,480
<i>- Once in your life
if you are very lucky,</i>

141
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,440
<i>you will meet the person
who divides it...</i>

142
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,440
<i>into the time
before you met her</i>

143
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,240
<i>and the time after.</i>

144
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,400
<i>But she was, you know,
obviously big trouble,</i>

145
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,240
and--and I would've just
left it at that, except...

146
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,840
- Hey.

147
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,640
Hey! Give the gentleman
your seat!

148
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,800
Ha!

149
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,720
- Give me a break, all right?

150
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,760
- You're welcome.

151
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,800
You're welcome.

152
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,640
Darling.

153
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,160
Purse.

154
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,440
Purse!

155
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,480
- OK.

156
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,400
Not--not touching
you inappropriately.

157
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,840
OK, good.

158
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,400
I'm holding your waist.

159
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,640
Very specifically avoiding...

160
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,880
Yes.

161
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,400
Don't want a lawsuit.

162
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,440
OK.

163
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,360
Oh! Hey, yeah!

164
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,720
Hi! 5th and 11th.

165
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,040
- Is she dead?

166
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,840
- What? No!
She-- No!

167
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,640
She's--
She's not, uh... she's OK.

168
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,760
- OK.

169
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,520
- It's my, uh, my sister.

170
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,800
She's... good.

171
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,080
Aw!

172
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,160
Very heavy girl!
Not fat, just muscular.

173
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,880
I would assume,
'cause you're dense, as in--

174
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,440
Not stupid,
I mean, heavy.

175
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,320
Hey!

176
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,960
Behind you, Einstein!

177
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,000
Open--open the window!

178
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,920
- What are you doing
on the fire escape?

179
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,240
- Just open the window, man!

180
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,560
- That's the girl from
before. You drugged her?

181
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,520
Are you crazy?
- No!

182
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,520
- Did anyone see you?

183
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,480
- Just the lobby guard
and the rickshaw guy.

184
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,560
- This is what happens
to the repressed ones.

185
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,800
One day they just snap!
Why'd you bring her here?

186
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,400
- She was passed out
in the subway!

187
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,840
- I said talk to her,
not knock her unconscious.

188
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,800
Just-- here.

189
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,480
Head first. Head first.

190
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,440
- OK.

191
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,560
- Watch her head.

192
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,000
- Just give ma second.

193
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,280
- Come on!
- OK, OK.

194
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,920
- Oh, there you are.

195
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,160
- OK, she likes me.

196
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,520
Oh, she smells
like tequila.

197
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,400
- Let's keep her alive.

198
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,640
- OK!

199
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,840
- This is a very limp girl.

200
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,200
- Oh boy!

201
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,680
Oh boy!

202
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,440
- Well, we're in trouble.

203
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,680
- Purse.

204
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,440
- So you brought her home?

205
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,800
- I couldn't very well leave
her on a subway bench, right?

206
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,760
- Which makes this,
technically, kidnapping.

207
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,840
- Eventually, she will wake up,

208
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:58,040
she will take the walk
of shame out of here

209
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,600
and that'll be that.

210
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,120
- So, did you
talk to her?

211
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,840
- Not really.

212
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,960
- What's she like?
Is she nice?

213
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,440
- I'm not sure, but...

214
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,880
I don't think so.

215
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,880
- Security.
Open the door!

216
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,440
- We aren't even in real jail.
We're in university jail.

217
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,400
- I know.

218
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,840
This is so humiliating!

219
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,800
- Hey, Bellow!

220
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,680
Oh, I'm gonna be watching you!

221
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,240
You're on my radar!

222
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,480
- OK, um, I--I understand

223
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,200
and I thank you f-for
following due process on this--

224
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,160
- Go, Charlie!

225
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,240
- I respect what
you're doing. Thank you!

226
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,200
- Watch it, Bellow!

227
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,240
- Hello.

228
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,560
<i>- Who are you?</i>

229
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,520
- Uh, who are you?

230
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,640
- Who are you?

231
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,800
- Who are you?

232
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,840
- I'm the girl you abducted
this afternoon.

233
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:51,040
- Oh! Um, how did you
get this number?

234
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,240
- Oh, security was only
too happy.

235
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,160
I have all your information!

236
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,800
- Why are you
asking me who I am?

237
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,200
<i>- I'm not asking who you are.</i>

238
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,120
I'm asking
who you think you are.

239
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,880
- You know what?
I don't have time--

240
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,800
- Meet me at the Spike Gallery,
6th and 4th.

241
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,040
<i>- Um, no.</i>

242
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,480
- Why not?

243
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,720
- Because the
Tiller King representative

244
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,400
is coming to campus this week.

245
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,080
- Yeah, be there at 7:13.

246
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,360
- Definitely not nice.

247
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,200
- Charles Bellow.

248
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,080
- Charlie.

249
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,240
- Hmm.

250
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,120
I'll take a red.

251
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,360
- Ah!

252
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,760
- Red for the lady.
And for you, sir?

253
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,880
- Um, I--

254
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,760
I think the--
I think the white.

255
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,400
So red, yeah.

256
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,360
- OK then.

257
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,320
- So what happened?

258
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,280
- Well, you, uh--

259
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,240
- I can't hear you.

260
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,600
- You were completely drunk.

261
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,320
You almost fell
on the subway track.

262
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,160
I pulled you back
at the last instant.

263
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,280
You called me darling,
then you passed out.

264
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,640
I assumed responsibility.

265
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,280
I carried you back to my place

266
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:12,520
and somebody called security
on us-- on me-- on-- for you.

267
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,760
- I called you darling?

268
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,920
- Yeah.

269
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,040
- I think I remember that.

270
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,640
But I seriously
doubt the rest of it.

271
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,480
Jordan Roark.

272
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,440
- Rork.

273
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,320
- Roark.
R-O-A-R-K, Roark.

274
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,280
- OK.

275
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,640
- What are you studying?

276
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,640
- Uh, business.

277
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,600
- Are you smart?

278
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,600
- Uh, maybe a little.
I don't know.

279
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,520
- Well, most smart
people are smart enough

280
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,360
not to have
to study business.

281
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,200
Thank you...

282
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,240
for not leaving me on
the subway bench, Charles.

283
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,320
- You're welcome.

284
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,320
Um, and it's--
it's Charlie, please.

285
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,240
Uh, am I allowed to ask you

286
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,200
why you were dead drunk in
the middle of the afternoon?

287
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,360
- Goin' through
a reckless phase.

288
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,120
- And wh-- by that,
you mean...

289
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,400
- Don't know what it means?

290
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,440
- No, I--

291
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,200
- Guess you're
really not smart!

292
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,040
- I know what the word means,

293
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,600
I'm--I'm asking you
what--what you mean.

294
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,280
- What do you care, Chuck?

295
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,880
- Charlie!
And um, I'm interested.

296
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,320
- Chuck. Chuck. Chuck.
Chuck, Chuck, Chuck, Chuck.

297
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,480
Chuck! Chuck!

298
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,440
- OK, um...

299
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,760
I'm gonna go, Jordan.

300
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,640
Uh, I hope that you get
through your reckless phase

301
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,720
and that you have
a relatively happy

302
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,360
and disaster-free
rest of your life.

303
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,040
Um, goodbye.

304
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,160
- My fiancée broke up with me.

305
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,520
Uh... Uh, it's OK.

306
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,600
Here.

307
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,600
- You carry an handkerchief?

308
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,280
What are you, an asthmatic?

309
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,080
- No, I-- Where I'm from,
people carry handkerchiefs.

310
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,440
- Where are you from? 1850?

311
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,040
Is it clean?

312
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,120
- Yes.

313
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,040
- Fine.

314
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,560
Here.

315
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,560
- No, you--you can keep that.

316
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,040
- No, you take it.

317
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,400
- OK, I'll, uh...

318
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,640
Uh...

319
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,920
-...we can get them
away for a while.

320
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,200
- You want some?

321
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,040
- Yeah, thank you.
I, uh, OK.

322
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,440
Why did he, uh, why--

323
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,160
Why did he break up with you?

324
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,840
- Well...

325
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,360
I like bananas.

326
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,840
- You--

327
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,000
OK, um...

328
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,120
It's OK.

Just to make sure.

- Hi, Jimmy.
How was your day?

361
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,600
- Ah, you know, the usual.
Held some doors, said hello.

362
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,800
- Is she gonna be OK?

363
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,880
- Yes, sir.

364
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,200
- Can you give her
some aspirin, some water?

365
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,840
Yes, sir.

366
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,280
- Thank you.

367
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,200
- Uh, anytime there, Spanky!

368
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,760
- Ah, yeah.
5th and 11th.

369
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,520
Whoa!

370
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,880
- We now have dealerships
in all 50 states,

371
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,920
including Alaska and Hawaii.

372
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,800
Now, of course,
we made our reputation

373
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,720
on big, heavy farm machinery,

374
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,840
but we also
have a line of mowers

375
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,400
that is second to none.

376
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,680
What?

377
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,760
- Oh please,

- Is there a Charles Bellow
in this room?

379
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,640
Damn it!

380
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,880
- Yes, sir.

381
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,120
- Mr. Bellow,

382
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:05,200
I believe you'd better go
with this young lady.

383

- I--I don't--
I don't...

384
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,000
I don't think
that'll be necessary.

385
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,280
- Oh, Mr. Bellow,

386

I believe you had better go

Now, if there is anything

390
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,920
to take responsibility
for his own actions.

391
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,080
- Yes, sir.

392
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,320
- Now...

393
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,040

- What?

398
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,080
- Come play with me.
It's a beautiful day.

399
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,480
- No, I-- First of all,
I was in the middle of a--

400
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,840
- No, I--I took care of that.

401
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,600
- Yeah, whoa!
What did that note say?

402
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,640
- Nothing.

403
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,440
- No, what did the note say?

404
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,320
- It said that I just found out

405
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,440
that I'm pregnant
with your child.

406
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,960
- No, don't scream,

407
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,040
'because it's gonna
make it worse.

408
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,080
- Why-- You don't--
You-- You--

409
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,080
Do you have any idea
what you've done?

410
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,040
That's--that's--

411
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,280
that's the Tiller King
representative in there.

412
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,600
That's my future in there!

413
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,600
- Really?

414
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,880
- Yes!

415
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,840
- How sad!

416
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,680
- I can't believe that you--

417
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,720
- Well, fine!

418
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,280
But as practical matter, Chuck,

419
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,240
you really can't go
back in there now.

420
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,960
So you might as well

421

496
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,880
- Pick up that cigarette!

497
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,880

- Get back here!

499

All I want you to do
is pick up the cigarette!

500

- You're a little bit nuts!

501

- Come here!
- Get away from me!

503

504
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,160
Are you OK?

505
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,800
- Definitely not.

506
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,680
- Hey! Fifty bucks
for your cart.

507
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,880
- I love New York!

508
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,240
- How's your head?
Is it OK?

509
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,560
- I hear a hum.

510
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,920
- So what did you think
of the treatment?

511
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,040
- The-- I think--
Uh, I think--

512
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,640
I think it's a love story,

513
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,320
and that they should
be nicer to each other.

514
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,000
- It's not a love story.

515
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,360
Charlie, it's a story about how
men can't handle big trouble.

516
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,400
- Um, well, I think
people are still gonna want

517
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,760
to see them kiss.

518
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,760
- Well, maybe people shouldn't
always get what they want!

519
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,320
- I tried to tell him...

520
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,280
- OK.

521
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,160
- Look, don't patronize me,
Charlie, OK?

522
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,440
You know what? Like I care
what you think anyway!

523
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,760
- Don't make eye contact.
Don't look. Come on!

524
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,560

I--I--I like you.

526
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,680
And the last 3 days have been,

527
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,640
uh, some of the most
interesting--

528
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,320
if not, painful-- of my life.

529
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:40,240
But my brain is haemorrhaging
and my career is ruined

530
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,720
and I just think it's
better if we part ways.

531
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,680
- Ha!

532
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,400
- OK, but your head'll clot.

533
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,400
And you know what?

534
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,240
Did you think that maybe
you were meant for better

535
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,600
than a career with
the Tiller King Company?

536
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,560
- No!

537
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,520
- Here.

538
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,560
- What? Where are we?

539
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,880

You may have some
headaches for a while.

541

- No shit!

542
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,560
- Take Tylenol, not Advil.

543
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,680
And, uh, don't go
to sleep tonight.

544
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,800
- Really?

545
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,120
- Yeah, you have
a level one concussion.

546
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,240
Just in case.

547
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,120
- OK.

548
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,920
- And I think it would be best

549
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,040
if you didn't
see my daughter again.

550
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:21,320
- Um, you speaking as my doctor
or as her father?

551
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,600
- Jordan tells me
that you're the young man

552
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,400
that brought her
home the other night.

553
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,720
- I am.

554
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,720
- It seems to me that
whenever you two get together,

555
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,280
someone becomes separated
from his senses.

556
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,480
You're obviously
a bad influence on her.

557
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,840
- I'm a bad influence on her?

558
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,840
- Would you disagree?

559
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:51,240
- No, sir, I would not.
Thank you.

560
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,480

You know, ever since
the fiancée,

562
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,000
he's been really
overprotective and--

563
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,600
- Yeah, no, he's your dad.

564
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,880
Um, you know,
he's just lookin' out for you.

- There are people.

- Don't go to sleep, man!
- Aw!

579
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:17,400
- Don't sleep! The doctor
said I gotta stay up.

580
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,200
- So don't go to sleep!
Leave me alone!

- Yeah, but it's my birthday.

653
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,000
- I know! That's why
we're at the--

654
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,200
- Right.

655
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,800
- The amusement... park.

656
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,240
Come on! Come on!

657
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,840
First in 10 from the Jets...

658
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,200
- Why don't you think about it?
Want to keep track.

659
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,680
Boom. Thank you.

660
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,920
- You owe me one, Leo.

661
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,680
A huge one.

662
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:03,400
- T-minus 10 minutes
till music and fireworks.

663
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,360
- Mmm.

664
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,040
- It starts off kind
of slow, but it gets--

665
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,160
- Ha! Oh my god!

666
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,440
- Hands on your heads.
- Are you part of it? Because--

667
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,600
- I said hands on your heads!
What are you doing here?

668
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,920
- Uh, it's a very special
birthday celebration.

669
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,320
What are you doing here?

670
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,040
- I'm hiding out.

671
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:47,040
- Great! This is really great.
- I'm not happy about it either.

672
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:56,800
- Hands on your heads and move!

673
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,960
- Best birthday ever.

674
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,240
- "One should recall
what one owes--"

675
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,360
- Hey! Hey!

676
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:12,240
Was a crazy guy with a
machine gun part of the program?

677
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,760
- No.

678
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:17,000
- I'm just saying--
- But I asked for one thing.

679
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,680
- When have you not had a good
time at an amusement park,

680
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,720
besides this time?

681
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,080
- Shut up!
What is your relationship?

682
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,440
- We're just friends, sir.

683
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,160
- Bullshit!

684
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,200
One look at you two,
I know that's not true.

685
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,920
- Give me my jacket.
Where's my manual?

686
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,360
- I had a girlfriend too.

687
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,280
- Oh, I'm not his girlfriend.

688
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,680
- For a year and a half.

689
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:40,480
But then, when I enlisted,
she left me for this Frenchman!

690
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,560
Can you believe it?
A Frenchman!

691
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,360
We had a dog!

692
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,920
Yorkshire terrier.
Rufus.

693
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,560
But you know what?
Fuck Rufus!

694
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,960
'Cause he too
now seems to love the Frenchman!

695
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:51,920
- Uh, who do I--

696
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,160
- I gotta have my manual.

697
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,120
- Hello? Hello?

698
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,280
- Where's my manual?

699
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,120
- So tonight, at lights out,

700
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,280
grabbed my weapon,

701
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,320
and I came to kill them,
Rufus included.

702
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,280
But they weren't home.

703
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,840
I have the worse luck.

704
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,560
- I'm sorry.

705
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,600
Had we known, we would've
gone to Six Flags.

706
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,840
- I'm on hold.
- I got it! I found the manual.

707
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:19,880
- I change my mind.
I'm not gonna kill them.

708
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,960
- I'm gonna kill myself.

709
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,960
- Uh, well, that's
sad to hear, but if--

710
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,920
- You know, I heard when you
fire a bullet into your head,

711
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,240
your entire skull explodes.

712
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,800
You know, as opposed to this

713
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,520
sort of little, red bullet-hole
thing you see in the movies.

714
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,280
- What's the difference?
You're dead!

715
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,440
- Why kill yourself?

716
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,320
It's not gonna make her
come back to you.

717
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,560
- But it'll put me
out of my misery.

718
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,560
And it'll hurt her.

719
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,360
She'll never be the same.

720
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:45,280
- You're wrong, 'cause time
will pass, and she'll be fine.

721
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,360
- How do you know?

722
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,800
- Because that's
the way it works.

723
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,520
- How do you know?

724
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,000
- It has to be.

725
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,480
- So then I'm screwed.

726
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,200
If I kill myself, it
accomplishes nothing,

727
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,360
plus I'm dead.

728
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,640
If I don't, I get court-
martialled for desertion.

729
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,200
- Of the two, I would go with
the court martial though.

730
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,960
Good luck!
- You know what?

731
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,440
Your eyebrows remind me
of the Frenchman's

732
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,640
- Take me. Let her go.

733
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,600
- What?

734
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,000
- Jordan, it's been very nice

735
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,400
getting to know you a little.

736
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,120
Um, happy birthday.
- No.

737
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,040
- This is between you and me.
Let her go.

738
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,200
- Drop your weapon!

739
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,960
- I will not!
You drop your weapons!

740
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,320
- No, you drop your weapon!
- You drop your weapons!

741
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,560
- Wait!
- You drop your weapon!

742
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:30,160
- You can't make me!
- Yes, I can!

743
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,840
- You drop your weapon!
- No, you!

744
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,080
- Just wait a second!
Just please, wait!

745
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,560
- No, you!
- Wait a minute!

746
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,840
Listen to me!

747
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,520
You're girlfriend, she
broke your heart, didn't she?

748
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,440
- Yes!
- She left you.

749
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,240
She broke her promise
and betrayed you.

750
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,400
- Yes!
Yes, she did.

751
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,920
- Some of us are
meant to suffer!

752
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,280
Some of us are
led to believe

753
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,920
that we have
this certain destiny,

754
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,600
and then it just
gets snatched away.

755
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,760
But we have to stay alive.

756
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,520
Because we have to see...

757
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,040
how the story ends.

758
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,040
Right?

759
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,720
Please.

760
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,560
- Hey!

761
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,760
If you're smart
you'll stay with her!

762
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:25,600
She's a great girlfriend!
I can tell.

763
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,360
Suspect is down!

764
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,880
I say again:
suspect is down!

765
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,520
- We're just friends.

766
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,160
So that's what you think?

767
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,680
- Not exactly, um,
I--I--I hadn't--

768
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,400
I--I don't know what category.

769
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,560
- Listen!

770
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,360
We're seeing each other.

771
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,600
- We are?
- Of course.

772
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,200
- OK!

773
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,600
<i>Her birthday was
an unmitigated disaster,</i>

774
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,400
but all things considered...

775
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,760
- Come on!

776
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,560
<i>-...I felt pretty good,</i>

777
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,560
<i>because I had seen
the depth of her soul,</i>

778
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,560
<i>and I found out
we were seeing each other.</i>

779
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,640
- Gotcha!

780
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,080
- Hey! Let's do this.

781
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,840
- Oh, yeah!

782
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,120
- Oh!

783
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,880
- Aah!
- Whoops!

784
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,920
Oh! Wait!

785
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,960
# Pachelbel's Canon #

786
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,520
- Ow! Ow! Ow!

787
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,960
<i>Some days with her were...
painful.</i>

788
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,360
OK, Rork wins
- Roark!

789
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,680
- So, are there
any questions about...

790
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:41,040
<i>- But hours without her
were even worse.</i>

791
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,680
Hi. Waiting.

792
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,640
- You look just like him.

793
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,480
- Uh, I've been told.

794
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,640
- You're his brother?

795
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,760
- Cousin.
- Ah!

796
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,320
I miss him and your aunt.

797
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:08,000
They came in here
every Sunday for years,

798
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,160
always took
the same table.

799
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,040
She's hardly
been back since.

800
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,400
- Um--

801
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,920
- You miss me?
- Yeah.

802
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,120
- Great. Thank you!

803
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,720
- Certainly.

804
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:20,160
<i>- I have a present for you.</i>

805
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,880
- Do you?

806
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,160
- Ta-da!

807
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,360
- Oh, good!

808
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,480
- What?
You don't wanna read it?

809
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,360
- No, I--I--
I most certainly do.

810
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,400
Thank you.

811
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,120
Bounty hunter.

812
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:41,760

And the outlaw's name is Chuck!</i>

00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,840
<i>- The heroine was</i>

814
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,600
a mysterious bounty hunter,

815
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,520
<i>who arrived one day
from parts unknown.</i>

816
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,280
- The Bounty Hunter!
It's good title!

817
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,800
- It's a great title!
- Read it.

818
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,640
- I'm not good at
reading and talking.

819
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,240
- Read it!
- OK, I'm reading it.

820
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,200
- Are you reading it?
- I am, uh, reading it.

821
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,560
- Just picture it, OK?

822
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,480
Come on! Come on! Come on!

823
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,720
Do-do-do! Do-do-do!

824
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,240
Oh, how you'll like it!

825
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,680
<i>- She kills him.
What a shock!</i>

826
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,520
<i>Only then does she reveal
where she came from...</i>

827
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,200
<i>The future.</i>

828
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,440
- Isn't it great?

829
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,600
- Ooh! It's, uh...
It is...

830
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,200
It's is...

831
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,360
Uh... question.

832
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:30,880
Why, uh, why does the heroine
always come from the future?

833
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,880
- Because I believe
in time travel.

834
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,840
I believe that in the future
it's already been invented,

835
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:39,120
and that there are people from
the future with us as we speak.

836
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,160
And I think that one day,

837
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,000
I will eventually meet
someone from the future.

838
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,320
- I'm sure you will then.

839
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,280
- I have another
present for you.

840
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,240
- OK.

841
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,880
What is that?

842
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,520
- You've been granted an
interview with the vampire.

843
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,600
A regional sales manager
named Mr. Phipps,

844
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:04,360
who will be selecting
Tiller King management trainees.

845
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,440
Drinks tomorrow.
His hotel.

846
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,720
- OK, that is great news.

847
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,560
Um, where did you get this?

848
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,960
- Your mailbox.

849
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,920
- You went through my mail?

850
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,160
Why would you go--
That's illegal! You're not--

851
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,040
- Are we gonna argue about that?
- Yes!

852
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,360
- Or are you gonna have
a great dinner tonight,

853
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,760
wake up tomorrow and have
an amazing interview

854
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,080
and call me the second
that it's done.

855
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,280
<i>- What a city, huh, Charlie?</i>

856
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,680
- Yes, sir!
Yes, sir, Mr. Phipps.

857
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,120
- You know,
I can never remember.

858
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,960
Is the Bronx up
or the Battery down

859
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,760
or the Battery up
and the Bronx down?

860
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,720
- First one, I think.

861
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,640
- Right! Right!

862
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,720
Sure!

863
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,240
- Drinks, gentlemen?

864
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,720
- Diet Pepsi, please.

865
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,760
- And for you?

866
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,960
- 2 Diet Pepsis, comin' up!

867
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,480
- So, Charlie!

868
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:06,400
Your dad works at the
maintenance facility

869
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,880
in French Lick?

870
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:10,440
- Uh, 27 years, sir, yes.

871
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,960
- Looked him up.

872
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,520
He is a model employee.

873
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,720
I mean, you only wish

874
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:19,440
every employee was cut
from the same cloth!

875
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,920
if you're a chip off
that block, let me tell you,

876
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,760
I think your chances
are pretty good indeed.

877
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,880
- Uh, that is--

878
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,440
- All right!

879
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:33,040
- Diet Pepsi for you.

880
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,040
Diet Pepsi for you!

881
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,400
Oops!

882
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,200
And a double tequila for me!

883
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,600
Charlie, push over.

884
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,440
- You two know each other?

885
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,600
- Uh, this, uh,
this is Mr. Phipps.

886
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:47,000
This is Jordan Roark.
We are-- She--

887
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,560
We're--
we're seeing each other.

888
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,440
- Well!

889
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,520
- Oh!

890
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,520
- It's a pleasure to
meet you, Miss Roark.

891
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,880
- Oh, well the pleasure
is all mine, Mr. Phipps.

892
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,760
- To the Tiller King Company!

893
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,120
- Yes, indeed!

894
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,640
- Oh boy!

895
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,160
- Oh!

896
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,360
Oh.

897
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,200
Dmitri!
Can I get another one?

898
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,160
- Right away!

899
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,720
- Oh, I'm sorry,
did you-- anything else?

900
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,240
- No, no, no.
We're good.

901
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,280
- Uh, Mr. Phipps--

902
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,040
- How did you two
meet each other?

903
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,480
- Uh--

904
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,960
- Well, it depends
on who you believe.

905
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,680
Either I got drunk and passed
out in the subway platform,

906
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,000
or he drugged me.

907
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,000
- She's so silly!

908
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,480
- I see!

909
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,760
- Tequila? Double?

910
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,320
- Yes, thank you!

911
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,360
To the Tiller King
Company! Whoo!

912
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,480
- Righty-o!

913
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,600
- Cheers!

914
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,000
- Righty-o!

915
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,080
- Um, as I was, uh...

916
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,440
- Ah!

917
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,680
-...saying about
the annual report, uh...

918
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,480
- Dmitri! Another!

919
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,480
- Got it!

920
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,480
- Oh, there I go again.
Anyone else?

921
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,040
- No.
- No, thank you.

922
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,040
- Oh boy!

923
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,120
- Um, I, uh--

924
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,880
- How long have
you two been together?

925
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,000
- Oh, not very long.

926
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,120
We're still in
the beginning phases.

927
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,800
I haven't seen his penis yet.

928
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,880
- There you are!

929
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,600
- Ha ha!
Tequila double.

930
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,280
Thank you!

931
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,600
Hey! Do not lose that bottle!

932
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,120
- I won't!

933
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,280
- To the King Killerton...

934
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,040
Tiller King,
King Tiller. Whatever!

935
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,560
Cheers.

936
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,560
Oh god!

937
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,080
- She's, um--

938
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,680
- That is wrong, but so good!

939
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:29,360
- She's-- She's uh...

940
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:32,120
She's gone through
a lot recently.

941
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,760
- Charlie?

942
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,440
- Yeah, yeah.
You're-- You OK?

943
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,640
Oh, OK.

944
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:38,760
It's OK. It's OK.

945
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,720
- Oh god!

946
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:40,800
- I should get her--

947
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,240
- Can I help you?
- No, no, no!

948
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:47,120
It's easy as pie.
Um, a pleasure, sir.

949
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,680
Really, I look forward to, um,
to--to hearing from you and--

950
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,120
- Give me a call.

951
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,800
- I'm gonna get her
outta here. I'm sorry.

952
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:56,760
Bye!

953
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,280
- To the Killer Ting!

954
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:00,200
- Shh!

955
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,280
<i>- I'm concerned, Charlie.</i>

956
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,400
I mean, I get it.

957
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:09,160
This girl's smart,
she's interesting,

958
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:10,960
she's insanely hot,

959
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,840
she's making you live.

960
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,880
So what I'm going to say,

961
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:18,800
should be heard within
that context.

962
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,640
OK.

963
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,280
She's a friggin' nut!

964
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,080
She's bent on destroying you
in every way possible,

965
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:28,760
your physical person,
your emotional person,

966
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:30,000
your personal person!

967
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,640
Add those things up,
that's a whole person!

968
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,600
Now, there's something
to be said for being

969
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,640
exquisitely tortured
and financially bled.

970
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:39,240
As long as
it's by the right girl.

971
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:42,200
What bothers me
is that while you do perform

972
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:45,360
many of the traditional
functions of a boyfriend,

973
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,760
you are not,
it is my understanding,

974
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:48,880
sleeping with her.

975
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,120
Is that correct?

976
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:52,560
- You know, it is possible
for two people

977
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:55,560
to have a relationship
without sleeping together.

978
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,600
- Yes, and they have
a word for that.

979
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:58,720
Friendship.

980
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,680
- Oh, sure, yeah!
Where'd you get that?

981
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,880
Your German porn collection?

982
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,200
Everything will work
itself out in due time.

983
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,280
She is still getting over
her break-up.

984
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,600
- Forget about the sex then.

985
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:11,040
Let's just talk about what
the sex brings with it:

986
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:15,400
mainly, a little emotional
investment on her part.

987
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,320
In the absence of which,

988
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:20,360
she could really wind up
killing you, Charlie.

989
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:23,440
<i>- OK, all right.</i>

990
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:27,680
On the reasons-to-
stop-seeing-her side, we have

991
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,160
One, on-going physical danger.

992
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,880
Two, high likelihood
of a broken heart.

993
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,720
Three, uh, career sabotage.

994
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:40,800
Four, she is clinically insane.

995
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,840
Five, she seems to enjoy
my pain.

996
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:45,680
Six...

997
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:49,520
14-piece match set of
Louis Vuitton emotional baggage.

998
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,680
Seven, I haven't even
kissed her yet for god's sake!

999
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:57,480
Uh, 5, 6, 7...

1000
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:59,760
Eight, she's ruining my life.

1001
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,680
- And the reasons
to keep seeing her?

1002
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,240
- I'm in love with her.

1003
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,080
- Hello.

1004
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:15,280
- I'm sorry about the interview.

1005
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:18,560
- Yeah, I really wish
you hadn't done that.

1006
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:21,680
I couldn't let you just give
your life and your brain

1007
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,080
<i>to those people.</i>

1008
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:26,240
- I want to give my life
and my brain to those people.

1009
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:27,760
- No, you don't!

1010
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:31,160
Just think of it as
me saving you from yourself.

1011
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:32,800
<i>- I see.</i>

1012
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,920
Come on, Charlie,
that's why human beings exist!

1013
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,080
To save each other
from ourselves.

1014
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,160
- It's an interesting theory.

1015
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:46,960
- I still wanna
make it up to you.

1016
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:50,400
Tomorrow's our 33rd day
since we met.

1017
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,920
- Is it?

1018
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,360
- Meet me at
Arts and Sciences, Room 105,

1019
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:56,560
at 1:00 o'clock
tomorrow afternoon.

1020
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,960
And bring a single red rose.

1021
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,360
- No! No!

1022
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:02,280
No! You know what?
You can't--

1023
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:05,520
You can't, uh,
just boss me around, you know?

1024
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:06,800
<i>Enough is enough.</i>

1025
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,000
Hello? Are you there?
Are you there?

1026
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,720
Hello? Hello?

1027
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:15,240
OK.

1028
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:22,560
- Aw, crap!

1029
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,280
Uh...

1030
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,760
OK, uh, one single red rose,
like she said.

1031
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,280
<i># Pachelbel's Canon #</i>

1032
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,600
# # #

1033
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:06,640
Whatever she was going through,

1034
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:09,560
<i>it was beyond anything
in my experience,</i>

1035
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:11,440
and beyond my ability to fix.

1036
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,960
I had no right to judge her.

1037
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:19,080
<i>If I chose to stay with her,
knowing the risks,</i>

1038
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:23,920
<i>all I could do
was give her love and respect...</i>

1039
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:27,720
and see how the story would end.

1040
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:33,080
# # #

1041
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:01,040
- I don't wear underwear
on days I play the piano.

1042
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,400
- Really.

1043
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,920
- Should we get out of here?

1044
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:04,880
- Yeah.
- Uh--

1045
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,920
Aw, my feet are killing me.

1046
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:11,640
- I could give
you a foot rub.

1047
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:13,800
- No, no, we'll
just exchange shoes.

1048
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,880
- What?

1049
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:19,680
- No!

1050
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:21,720
No!

1051
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:23,160
- Fine!

1052
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,440
- Fine!

1053
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:30,960
- # Dum-dee-dum-
dee-dee-do-dee #

1054
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:34,560
These aren't gonna work.

1055
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:35,840
- That's what I thought.

1056
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:38,480
We didn't know if it was
sleeping, or whatever,

1057
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,080
and so he was like:

1058
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:42,000
"Why don't you throw
a rock at it?"

1059
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,360
And I was like: "No,
you throw a rock at it.

1060
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:46,160
By this point,
we were only 7 years old.

1061
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,240
I didn't know if I was
right or left-handed--

1062
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,720
- I bet the water isn't very
deep. What do you think?

1063
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:53,760
- Uh, I was-- I was kind of
in the middle of a--

1064
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:56,080
I don't know.
I don't have any way to--

1065
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:59,440
- Why don't you come sit up here
and tell me what you think?

1066
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,320
- That's not gonna
help me fi--

1067
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:03,280
It's kind of
dangerous, actually.

1068
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:04,920
We can go to
tourist information,

1069
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:06,160
or maybe on the Internet.

1070
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:07,720
- Charlie, don't be
such a wuss!

1071
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:09,360
I just wanna know
how deep it is!

1072
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:10,320
- I'm not a wu--

1073
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:11,840
There's a sign!
It's forbidden!

1074
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:13,880
- Yeah, OK.
Just finish your story.

1075
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:22,640
- Whoa!

1076
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:27,360
- Whoopsie!

1077
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:29,320
- Why me?

1078
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:31,920
- Well, that's
surprisingly deep.

1079
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:42,240
Charlie!

1080
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:47,800
- OK, OK.

1081
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,000
- Was that deep enough for you?

1082
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:51,960
- So it's true?

1083
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:52,920
- What?

1084
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:55,680
- You don't wear
underwear on recital days.

1085
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:56,680
- I never lie.

1086
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,720
- Oh, wow!

1087
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:30,440
Oh! Damn it!

1088
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:33,360
- Yes! Yes!

1089
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:35,200
- Sorry.
I'm sorry!

1090
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,400
- Great!

1091
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:37,360
- Um, sorry.

1092
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:38,920
- Jordan.

1093
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:40,680
- It's late.

1094
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,280
- Could be worse.

1095
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:43,600
- Good night, young man.

1096
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:44,920
- It's OK.

1097
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:48,000
- I--I'm sorry.

1098
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
- I said goodnight, young man.

1099
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,120
- Dad, enough, OK?

1100
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:53,520
I'm allowed to have
whoever I want over.

1101
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,440
- I'm sick and tired of it.
I've had it!

1102
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,040
- I don't want to
hear it anymore!

1103
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,720
-...loss of control
over yourself!

1104
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:00,320
I told you not to
see him anymore!

1105
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:01,320
Do you understand me?

1106
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:03,320
- What you're trying
to do is not helping.

1107
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:05,240
- How do you know what
I'm trying to do?

1108

- You know what--

00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,080

00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:10,480
- A guy.

1135
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:13,920
- I can't.

1136
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:15,360
- Why not?

1137
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:19,280
- I am out with a girl.

1138
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,160
- No, you're not.

1139
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:22,760
- Yeah, I am.

1140
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:24,240
- Are you on your way?

1141
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,040
- No, I'm not coming!

1142
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:55,920
Nice penis. Gotta go!

1143
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:01,600
- That was really, really nice.

1144
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:04,160
- You should've called me.
Why didn't you call me?

1145
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:05,840
- I know,
I shouldn't be drinking.

1146
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:07,120
- I told you!

1147
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:09,880
- Hello?

1148
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:11,080
- Hi!

1149
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:14,280
I'm Jean-Jacques.

1150
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:16,680
It's nice to meet you.

1151
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:18,360
- Nice to meet you.

1152
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:21,120
- Please, have a seat.

1153
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:28,360
- Were you really
with a girl?

1154
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:32,720
- No, I was with a guy.

1155
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,120
- I knew it.

1156
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:40,320
- Well, uh, Charlie,
I've heard a lot about you.

1157
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:41,800
- Have you?

1158
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:46,040
- I understand you're
a good friend of Jordan's.

1159
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:52,640
- That's right.

1160
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:57,280
- Would you excuse me, please?

1161
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:26,040
- Where's Charlie?

1162
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:27,800
- He left.

1163
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:30,240
He said he had to study.

1164
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:31,880
- Oh.

1165
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:35,320
- You were right.
I liked him very much.

1166
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:39,800
In fact, he gave me 10 rules
to follow in our relationship,

1167
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:44,600
which I thought was
a little odd, but generous.

1168
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:47,080
- What were they?

1169
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:48,760
- Let's see.

1170
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:52,680
First, don't let her drink.

1171
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:55,640
When she does,
use the fireman's carry.

1172
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:00,080
Be prepared to go to jail.

1173
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:04,280
<i>- Don't expect
a lot of help from her dad.</i>

1174
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:09,000
Whatever you think
is gonna happen next,

1175
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,720
you're wrong.

1176
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:15,800
If her feet hurt,
exchange shoes with her.

1177
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,320
<i>Learn to say
the following phrase</i>

1178
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:22,240
over and over to yourself:

1179
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:25,080
It's all part of the charm.

1180
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:34,160
On your 33rd day together,
bring her a single rose.

1181
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:37,240
Give it to her
in her recital class.

1182
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:45,960
If she says she's
gonna kill you,

1183
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:48,800
don't assume
it's a metaphor.

1184
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:55,560
<i>She likes to write.
Encourage her.</i>

1185
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:58,720
<i>And finally,
your time with her</i>

1186
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:02,480
<i>will be the happiest
you've been in your life.</i>

1187
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:06,960
Enjoy every second.

1188
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,640
- Hey, watch out!

1189
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:32,160
- Charlie.

1190
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:42,840
Wake up!

1191
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:44,440
Hey, wake up!

1192
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:45,720
- What?

1193
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:51,000
<i>Attention passengers on...
downtown platform.</i>

1194
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,960
<i>- What kind of diction
is that?</i>

1195
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,560
How could anyone
understand you?

1196
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:56,720
- Should I make the
announcement at all?

1197
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:58,560
Because I could
easily forget the whole--

1198
00:57:58,560 --> 00:57:59,720
- I would rather,

1199
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:02,520
if you're gonna do
something nice for someone,

1200
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:04,960
that you did it
properly and well.

1201
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:07,480
<i>- This PA system is
50 years old!</i>

1202
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:10,080
If the queen of England made
the announcement

1203
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:11,680
you wouldn't understand it!

1204
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:14,120
- The queen wouldn't step foot
in this shithole!

1205
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:18,240
<i>- I'll tell you what.
You make the announcement.</i>

1206
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:20,040
We'll see if
you can do any better.

1207
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:22,240
- Well, it couldn't
be any worse, right?

1208
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:24,240
Let's see.

1209
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:25,840
- Charlie? I'm sorry.

1210
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:28,600
<i>He's just a guy my father
made me go out with.</i>

1211
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:29,600
- Sorry!

1212
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:31,480
<i>- Every second
I was with him,</i>

1213
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:33,040
I was wishing it was you,

1214
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:34,760
<i>and that's why
I called you tonight.</i>

1215
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:36,080
I couldn't take it anymore.

1216
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:37,360
- That's him!

1217
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:39,080
<i>- Charlie, I need you.</i>

1218
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:42,040
Please, come to the
station master's office, OK?

1219
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,480
She's this rat-faced
woman, all right?

1220
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:46,920
But she'll let you in.

1221
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:49,560
OK? She's on the second floor.

1222
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:53,960
Charlie, please, just come
to the station master's office.

1223
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:55,800
I'm sorry.
Just don't...

1224
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:57,480
Don't leave me.

1225
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:00,280
Charlie!

1226
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:02,040
<i>- Charlie!
Praise Jesus!</i>

1227
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:05,680
All right?

1228
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:07,400
You can go now.

1229
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:15,120
Wait! Who said
you could hug me?

1230
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:17,640
- Nobody!

1231
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:19,800
- I like the way
you handle me. Come on!

1232
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:26,600
<i>- That night, all she wanted
to do was dance.</i>

1233
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:30,000

Sir...

Would you mind, uh, taking
the long way through the park?

1254

- Hey, Charlie!

1255
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:00,680
How's it goin'?

1256
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:02,320
- Good, Jimmy!
Thank you.

1257
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:05,240
- OK. Oh!
Oh, here we go.

1258
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:06,640

1262
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,680
How you doin'?
- Good.

1263

1264
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:17,720

next Thursday!

1265

<i>- Hello.</i>

1266

<i>- Yeah, um,
are you feeling beter?</i>

- What are you
laughing at?

1270
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:38,760
- Write me a letter telling
me how you feel about me.

1271
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:41,640
In truthful prose that is
deeply moving and not baroque.

1272
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:43,440
Don't overwrite.
I cannot bear that.

1273
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:44,400
- OK.

1274
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,040

a letter to you

I feel about you.

- Are you?

1277
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:49,840
- Mm-hmm. And believe me,

1278
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:52,160
my letter is going to be
extremely well-written.

1279
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:53,120
- I'm sure.

1280
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:54,640
- So work hard on your letter.

1281
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:57,480
Otherwise you're gonna be
embarrassed by the comparison.

1282
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:58,440
- I will!

1283
01:01:58,440 --> 01:01:59,960
- Bring it to Central Park.

1284
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:02,680
I'll meet you at the
promenade at 2:00 o'clock.

1285
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:04,120
- OK.

1286
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:05,880
- Write well.

1287
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:09,240
- Yeah, um, you too.

1288
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:11,160
- Oh, I will.

1289
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
- What?

1290
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:31,360
Do you suppose
someone could be heard

1291
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:33,200
from all the way
at the other end?

1292
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:34,680
- Yeah!

1293
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:37,600
Well, no.
May--

1294
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:39,680
Maybe. Maybe.
It's very far.

1295
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:42,720
I think-- I think if you had one
person who was extremely loud

1296
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:44,480
and the other person
had good hearing.

1297
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:45,440
- Go over there.

1298
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:50,000
I'll scream something from
here and answer if you hear me.

1299
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:53,080
- You want me to go
all the way down there?

1300
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:54,680
Just so you can...

1301
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:56,200
- Yeah.

1302
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:59,480
- All the way down
to the end?

1303
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:01,400
- Yes.

1304
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,840
Charlie!

1305
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:23,080
Can you hear me?

1306
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:31,680
Charlie, can you hear me?

1307
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:37,560
I'm sorry!

1308
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:41,240
I'm so sorry, I--

1309
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:43,720
I can't help it.
I--

1310
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:45,960
I can't help it!

1311
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:50,040
I thought I was different!

1312
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:54,400
I thought I was stronger,
but I'm not.

1313
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:20,640
- Why do we have
a cocktail shaker?

1314
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,680
Were you crying before?

1315
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:29,600
- It's a time capsule.
Give me your letter.

1316
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:31,680
- Why?

1317
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:33,720
- We're gonna put 'em
in here and bury them,

1318
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:35,040
and exactly a year from now,

1319
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:37,320
we're gonna come back
and we're gonna dig it up,

1320
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:39,960
read the letters, and maybe
then we'll have the answer.

1321
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:41,760
- What's the question?

1322
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:44,800
- The question is,
are we going to be together?

1323
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:47,320
- Well, I'm glad
that's the question.

1324
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:49,640
Why do we have to wait
a year to find out?

1325
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:51,880
- I explain it in my letter.

1326
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:00,400
- Which I have to wait a year
to read.

1327
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:05,920
A year is a long time.
A lot can happen.

1328
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:09,520
- Yeah.

1329
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:23,680
We'll meet back here,
under the tree,

1330
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:25,520
exactly a year from now.

1331
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:31,320
At 2:00 O'clock, OK?

1332
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:40,120
<i># I put a record on #</i>

1333
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:41,080
- Good?

1334
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:42,040
- Yeah.

1335
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:47,880
<i># Put it on and sing along
with you #</i>

1336
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:51,840
<i># Sing along with you #</i>

1337
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:57,000
Come on.

1338
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:05,120
<i># And that's OK by me #</i>

1339
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:07,800
<i># That's OK #</i>

1340
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:09,000
You take the first one.

1341
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,520
<i># Because in a way I'm free... #</i>

1342
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:11,800
- We could ride together.

1343
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:13,200
- No, I'll take the next one.

1344
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:15,840
If I don't say goodbye to you
now, I won't be able to.

1345
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:17,760
- Then don't.

1346
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:19,400
- I have to.

1347
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:21,520
- Why?

1348
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:23,480
- It's in the letter.

1349
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:27,560
<i># I will try #</i>

1350
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:28,560
- Right.

1351
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:31,560
<i># And dry my eyes #</i>

1352
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:35,920
<i># And I'm OK
if we're drinkin' #</i>

1353
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:41,400
<i># Grab a beer
and disappear with me #</i>

1354
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:44,760
<i># Disappear with me #</i>

1355
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:50,840
<i># And I put a record on #</i>

1356
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:57,440
<i># I put it on
and get it one with you #</i>

1357
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:00,640
<i># Get it on with you #</i>

1358
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:03,000
- Jordan?

1359
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,920
- Charlie!

1360
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:06,720
<i># This time #</i>

1361
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:07,760
Charlie?

1362
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:08,720
<i># You'll find #</i>

1363
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:09,920
Where are you?
Charlie!

1364
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:12,280
<i># Some other
gonna mess your mind #</i>

1365
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:15,080
<i># It's too late or too soon #</i>

1366
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:21,000
<i># Some other gonna come #</i>

1367
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:26,040
<i># Come too soon #</i>

1368
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,080
<i># Put it on #</i>

1369
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:34,160
<i># I will try and dry my eyes #</i>

1370
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:35,800
<i># Put it on #</i>

1371
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:43,200
- I knew what she'd be thinking.

1372
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:45,720
We were meant to be separated.

1373
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:51,160
So that's how we broke up.

1374
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:57,880
<i>Among my goals
for the next year,</i>

1375
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:00,920
were to improve myself for
when we got back together.

1376
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:03,280
It wasn't gonna be easy.

1377
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:07,720
<i>I had what you call
"poor hand-eye coordination",</i>

1378
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:11,240
and no natural buoyancy.

1379
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:14,320
Oh!

1380
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:17,240
But what I lacked in ability,
I made up for in determination.

1381
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:20,280
<i>Within 6 months,
I was beating Mr. Snapperstein.</i>

1382
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:22,360
- Oy!

1383
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:24,880
<i>- I could swim the crawl.</i>

1384
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:28,840
<i>And, my kendo instructor
stopped calling me</i>

1385
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:30,440
"He Who Dies Repeatedly".

1386
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:35,360
I filed a Hail Mary application
with the Tiller King people.

1387
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:37,320
<i>But I didn't hold out
a lot of hope.</i>

1388
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:40,280
<i>As a backup,
I took Estate Planning,</i>

1389
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:44,680
<i>which was only slightly
less boring than actually dying.</i>

1390
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:49,840
<i>Leo met new
and interesting people.</i>

1391
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:52,440
Um, this was before anyone peed.

1392
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:57,720
<i>My feelings for Jordan
didn't diminish at all.</i>

1393
01:08:57,720 --> 01:09:00,080
But then, I didn't want them to.

1394
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:02,600
- Oh!
- Whoa!

1395
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:06,840
- You have to go out
with other people.

1396
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:09,120
You can't just sit
around waiting for a year.

1397
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:13,080
- Because it's unwatchable!

1398
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:16,120
- Jordan.

1399
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:19,160
- Why not?

1400
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:22,720
- Because what would
be the point?

1401
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:27,520
- Twelve.

1402
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:29,840
Just go out with
12 regular girls,

1403
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:31,680
as a personal favour to me.

1404
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:34,600
- Eight.
- Ten

1405
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:37,560
- Ten.

1406
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:39,520
- I mean, I wouldn't mind...

1407
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:43,280
<i># She won't stop
to teach them all... #</i>

1408
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:47,400
- Sort of like an MBA
in the mind, huh?

1409
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:48,640
- Yeah.

1410
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:50,000
- Um, um, uh...

1411
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,920
- If you knew that, you wouldn't
have done that. Or would you?

1412
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:54,120
- Um...
- I'm sorry!

1413
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:55,760
- I, uh, OK.

1414
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:59,040
- C-H-E-R-R-I-S
- Tremendously...

1415
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:04,800
- Yeah, I don't think
this is gonna work.

1416
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:08,160
<i>- Anyway, it made
the time go by faster.</i>

1417
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:10,080
Finally, the day came.

1418
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:13,440
I-- I was a little nervous.
A little bit, you know.

1419
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:15,920
Slightly on edge.

1420
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:17,920
- Want me to go with you?

1421
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,880
- Why would I--

1422
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:24,440
Why would I possibly?

1423
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:25,920
- OK.

1424
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:28,960
- But thank you.

1425
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:31,520
- That's the bathroom.

1426
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:32,720
- I know!

1427
01:10:58,160 --> 01:11:00,120
<i>I was, of course, early</i>

1428
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:02,600
and she was, of course, late.

1429
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:14,920
<i>I didn't start to worry
until 2:30, 2:45.</i>

1430
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:18,960
Uh, by 3:00 I still wanted
to wait just a little longer,

1431
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:22,080
<i>but by 4:00,
I had to face facts.</i>

1432
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:24,160
<i>She wasn't coming.</i>

1433
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:27,720
<i>And there was
only one thing to do.</i>

1434
01:11:55,080 --> 01:12:00,120
<i>- Dear Charlie.
Hi. How was your year?</i>

1435
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:03,080
<i>Charlie, I have some things
to tell you.</i>

1436
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:04,280
<i>When we first met,</i>

1437
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:06,600
<i>I said that my fiancée
had broken up with me.</i>

1438
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:08,160
<i>That was a lie.</i>

1439
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:10,720
Truth is he passed away.

1440
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:14,120
<i>All he said in his note
was that he was sorry,</i>

1441
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:16,560
<i>but that there was
too much pain.</i>

1442
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:24,000
<i>I was devastated.
I couldn't accept it.</i>

1443
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,280
You know, I began to drink,

1444
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:27,480
<i>which, as you've seen,
I'm not very good at.</i>

1445
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:31,240
Oh, and I was frequently brought
home by strangers in taxi cabs,

1446
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:33,440
and that's why my father

1447
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:35,240
<i>acted the way
he did towards you.</i>

1448
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:38,800
Honestly, if you ever get to
know him, he's a very nice man.

1449
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:43,400
<i>I was very close
to my fiancée's mother.</i>

1450
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:46,880
<i>I tried to go see her
a little while after he died.</i>

1451
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:51,000
She said she had a great guy
she wanted to introduce me to.

1452
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,280
<i>I couldn't bear
the thought of it.</i>

1453
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:56,000
<i>And then I met you.</i>

1454
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:59,280
You reminded me of him.

1455
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:01,760
You were both strong and kind

1456
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:04,520
and confident...
in your own way.

1457
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:06,680
Charles Bellow.

1458
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:10,880
- Charlie.

1459
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:15,200
<i>- Hmm. You even look like him.</i>

1460
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:17,400
<i>And there were
many other parallels.</i>

1461
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:20,880
<i>They were small,
but they seemed important.</i>

1462
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:25,000
<i>He and I met
on a subway platform.</i>

1463
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,600
<i>Just as you and I met.</i>

1464
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:31,680
<i>Like you, he carried
a handkerchief.</i>

1465
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:36,800
I was very sick at the time
and he took care of me...

1466
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:39,760
<i>like you did.</i>

1467
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:47,760
<i>As you and I
got to know each other,</i>

1468
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:50,480
<i>I felt the cloud begin
to lift a little bit.</i>

1469
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:51,960
I thought this was because

1470
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:54,760
<i>of the similarities
between you and him.</i>

1471
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:57,760
<i>And so I decided
that you and I</i>

1472
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:00,000
<i>would do everything
he and I had done.</i>

1473
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,280
<i>That way, it would be almost
like he had never died</i>

1474
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:04,800
and the pain would stop.

1475
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:10,680
<i>Because on
our 33rd day together,</i>

1476
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:12,480
he brought a rose to my class,

1477
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:14,760
I asked you to do the same.

1478
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:21,120
Because he and I planned
our future under this tree,

1479
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:23,680
<i>I chose it
for you and me as well.</i>

1480
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:31,280
<i>Because he and I had
a favourite restaurant...</i>

1481
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:32,240
Cheers!

1482
01:14:32,240 --> 01:14:33,920
<i>I brought you there.</i>

1483
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:36,920
<i>And because he died
in the ocean...</i>

1484
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:39,320
I pushed you to go in...

1485
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:42,080
<i>and then saved you.</i>

1486
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:44,120
<i>All of this was crazy</i>

1487
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:47,360
and selfish and wrong, I know.

1488
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:49,640
But grief can make us crazy.

1489
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:52,160
Anyway, it didn't work

1490
01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:53,520
<i>And at a certain point,</i>

1491
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:56,640
I realized I didn't like you
because you were like him.

1492
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:57,880
- Whoa!

1493
01:14:57,880 --> 01:15:00,240
<i>- I liked you
because I liked you.</i>

1494
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:02,400
<i>But every time
I started to be happy,</i>

1495
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:04,240
<i>I would stop myself.</i>

1496
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:06,600
It felt wrong to be happy.

1497
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:10,120
It felt wrong to let go,
to just forget about him,

1498
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:11,840
<i>even for just a minute.</i>

1499
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:13,960
<i>It felt like
I was betraying him.</i>

1500
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:16,800
All I could do was hurt you

1501
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:18,560
and that's not me, Charlie.

1502
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:20,400
<i>That's not me at all.</i>

1503
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:23,440
<i>And someday,
I hope I can show you as much.</i>

1504
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:30,600
Something had to be done.

1505
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:33,160
<i>In order for us to have
a chance in the future,</i>

1506
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:35,360
<i>I had to make a break
with the past.</i>

1507
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:38,600
<i>And for this,
I needed time.</i>

1508
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:44,960
I hope I've healed during
our year apart.

1509
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:48,280
And that I'm sitting with you
while you read this.

1510
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:58,080
But if I'm not...

1511
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:00,800
It's not because
I don't love you.

1512
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:03,040
Because I do.

1513
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:07,280
And it's not because
I don't miss you.

1514
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:10,880
Because I miss you already.

1515
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:15,680
It'll just mean
that I'm not better.

1516
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:19,800
And that the story
isn't over yet.

1517
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:28,800
<i>Will you wait for me, Charlie?
Can you wait?</i>

1518
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:31,320
<i>With all my heart,
I hope you can.</i>

1519
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:33,200
<i>Love, Jordan.</i>

1520
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:58,280
- Sir, is everything OK?

1521
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:00,960
- Yes.

1522
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:04,960
Oh, yes.

1523
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:07,160
Forgive me for staring.

1524
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:10,400
When I was younger, I would've
tried to be more discreet.

1525
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:13,440
But at my age,
I don't pretend anymore.

1526
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:14,400
What's the point?

1527
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:15,960
- I understand.

1528
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:19,920
- So it's OK
with you if I stare?

1529
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:22,280
- Stare away if you'd like.

1530
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:26,600
- That's great.
Thank you, thank you.

1531
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:28,280
- Is this your tree?

1532
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:29,760
Yes.

1533
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:32,800
Well, not exactly,

1534
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:36,800
but this tree
and I have a secret.

1535
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:38,520
- You do!

1536
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:40,840
So do this tree and I.

1537
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:44,640
- Is this your rock pile?

1538
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:47,360
- Yes.

1539
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:49,280
- What does it mark?

1540
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:54,080
- Well...

1541
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:56,640
A year and a day ago,
my boyfriend and I,

1542
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:58,040
we buried letters here.

1543
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:01,160
We promised to meet back
a year later to read them,

1544
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:03,040
but I didn't show up yesterday.

1545
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:04,720
- I see.

1546
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:06,760
- What's your secret?

1547
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:10,560
- Tell me, have
you been back here

1548
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:12,400
since you buried
the letters?

1549
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:14,040
- No.

1550
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:16,720
- Do you know what's
happened in the meantime?

1551
01:18:16,720 --> 01:18:18,240
- No.

1552
01:18:18,240 --> 01:18:20,640
- Look closely at the tree.

1553
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:23,360
Does it look as
you remembered it?

1554
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:28,920
- Oh, uh, at first I thought so,
but now I'm not so sure!

1555
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:31,680
<i>- Four months ago,
the tree that was standing here</i>

1556
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:33,760
<i>was struck and killed
by lightening.</i>

1557
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:36,760
The young man who replaced
the tree comes here quite a lot.

1558
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:39,320
We've spoken once or twice.

1559
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:41,360
- You can traumatize
the roots. I read it.

1560
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:43,680
- What are you,
Martha Stewart?

1561
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:46,040
<i>- He tells me
it's very important</i>

1562
01:18:46,040 --> 01:18:47,600
that there be a tree here.

1563
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:51,240
Do you suppose he's the one

1564
01:18:51,240 --> 01:18:54,240
<i>with whom you buried
the letters?</i>

1565
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:58,000
- Yeah.

1566
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,480
- He's very nice.

1567
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:01,720
Very strong in his way.

1568
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:05,080
- Yeah, he is.

1569
01:19:05,080 --> 01:19:07,680
- Now, does the fact
that you've come here today

1570
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:09,000
mean that you're healed?

1571
01:19:10,240 --> 01:19:12,800
Yeah, I read your letters.

1572
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:15,360
I'm sorry.
It's very wrong of me,

1573
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:19,600
but it gets very boring just
coming, sitting here sketching.

1574
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:21,360
Besides, I told you,

1575
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:23,880
old people just do
what they want.

1576
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:26,840
- It's OK.

1577
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:31,760
- So... are you ready
to be with him now?

1578
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:34,600
- Well, I wouldn't have
come if I wasn't ready.

1579
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:35,960
- Great.

1580
01:19:35,960 --> 01:19:37,920
That's wonderful.

1581
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:40,920
Come on, I want you to
read the letter and call him.

1582
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:41,920
I'll help you dig.

1583
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:42,880
- Uh...

1584
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:43,880
- What?

1585
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:45,560
- Well, I'll read his letter,

1586
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:47,080
but I'm not gonna call him.

1587
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:50,040
- What are you nuts?
After all you've been through?

1588
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:51,160
- If it was meant to be,

1589
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:52,800
I would've been healed
by yesterday.

1590
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:55,960
- What kind of nonsense is that?
Yesterday was one day ago.

1591
01:19:55,960 --> 01:19:57,640
Your healing was
off by one day?

1592
01:19:57,640 --> 01:20:00,320
- One very important day.

1593
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:03,120
Destiny has spoken.

1594
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:05,760
And to search for him,

1595
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:08,480
would be like trying to
shape and mould destiny

1596
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:10,560
and that just can't
be a good idea.

1597
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:16,520
- Just suppose that the
shaping and moulding of destiny

1598
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:19,080
is in fact your destiny.

1599
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:24,880
- Ha! I never thought
about it like that.

1600
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:28,480
- I'll tell you what destiny
means if you really wanna know.

1601
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:31,400
That's the least I can do
for you letting me stare.

1602
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:35,560
- What does it mean?

1603
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:40,160
- Destiny is the bridge
you build

1604
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:42,400
to the one you love.

1605
01:20:45,680 --> 01:20:48,720
- Yeah, but if it's meant to be,
it's meant to be, right?

1606
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:50,600
- Aw!

1607
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:53,440
I've been hearing people
say that to me for 78 years,

1608
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:55,920
and I gotta tell you,
it really pisses me off!

1609
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:58,720
OK, I'll leave you
to your letter.

1610
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:01,600
It's not polite
for me to stay.

1611
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:04,120
Besides, you're going to cry.

1612
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:06,960
It's very moving.

1613
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:09,760
He must've written
many drafts.

1614
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:16,080
I wish you a story
with a happy ending...

1615
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:21,640
and the wisdom to look for it.

1616
01:21:22,640 --> 01:21:24,840
- Thank you.

1617
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:31,360
<i>- I got the job.</i>

1618
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:33,920
<i>- That's fantastic, Charlie!
- That's unbelievable!</i>

1619
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:36,120
- Yeah, you have no idea.

1620
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:37,680
Um, here's the thing.

1621
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:39,480
- Yeah?
- Uh-huh?

1622
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:41,520
- I don't wanna work for
Tiller King.

1623
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:43,400
- Why not?

1624
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:45,640
- I--I'm sorry.
I ju-- I don't.

1625
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:46,800
- Well, wha--

1626
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:48,960
What are you
gonna do then?

1627
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:52,560
- I'm gonna live.

1628
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:13,000
<i>Dear Jordan,</i>

1629
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,280
<i>This is the story</i>

1630
01:22:14,280 --> 01:22:16,640
<i>of the first and last time
I ever fell in love.</i>

1631
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:20,720
<i>And of the beautiful,
complicated, fascinating woman</i>

1632
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:24,240
<i>who inhabits my soul.</i>

1633
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:26,720
<i>I'm pretty sure
you're gonna leave me tomorrow,</i>

1634
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:29,800
<i>so I better say this
while I have the chance.</i>

1635
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:37,960
Whether we're together or apart,

1636
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:41,920
<i>You will always be
the woman of my life.</i>

1637
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:47,680
The only man I will ever envy
is the man who wins your heart,

1638
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:51,520
and I will always believe it was
my destiny to be that man.

1639
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:55,640
<i>If we never
see each other again,</i>

1640
01:22:55,640 --> 01:22:57,480
and you're out walking one day

1641
01:22:57,480 --> 01:23:01,240
<i>and you feel
a certain presence beside you...</i>

1642
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:20,280
<i>that will be me...</i>

1643
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:23,560
<i>loving you...</i>

1644
01:23:23,560 --> 01:23:25,680
<i>wherever I am.</i>

1645
01:23:30,120 --> 01:23:32,960
- I mean, should I
just forget about her?

1646
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,760
I should forget about her.

1647
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:37,520
Because, realistically,
it's-- I mean...

1648
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:40,840
Realistically, could we
ever really be together

1649
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:42,680
is the question, you know?

1650
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:46,520
And where is the line between
romantic and delusional?

1651
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:48,160
And how--how do you know

1652
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:50,880
once you've crossed
said line, you know?

1653
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:55,720
Do we live in the physical
world that we can touch,

1654
01:23:55,720 --> 01:24:00,240
or do we live in the world
we create in our minds?

1655
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:08,040
You should be a business major.

1656
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:20,080
Excuse me, I said sparkling.

1657
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:22,520
- Oh, there she is!

1658
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:29,440
Oh, you've gotten
even more beautiful.

1659
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:30,960
- Oh, please!

1660
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:32,680
You've not aged a day!

1661
01:24:32,680 --> 01:24:34,200
- Oh!

1662
01:24:35,960 --> 01:24:38,280
So, how are you?

1663
01:24:38,280 --> 01:24:40,000
- I'm good.

1664
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:47,800
Yeah.

1665
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:50,120
- Somewhere in heaven,
my son is sad.

1666
01:24:50,120 --> 01:24:52,080
- No. No, no, no.
He's not.

1667
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:55,080
- Oh.

1668
01:24:55,080 --> 01:24:57,120
No, you're right.

1669
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:00,160
He's happy for you.

1670
01:25:03,720 --> 01:25:05,760
I'm happy for you.

1671
01:25:07,160 --> 01:25:08,680
- Thank you.

1672
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:17,600
- So, shall I tell
you about this boy?

1673
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:18,760
- Oh--

1674
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:20,800
- He's the one I wanted
to introduce you to

1675
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:23,240
a year and a half ago,
but neither of you showed up.

1676
01:25:23,240 --> 01:25:24,640
He's a business student.

1677
01:25:24,640 --> 01:25:25,920
- Aunt Sally!

1678
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:27,920
- He's very, very smart.

1679
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:29,800
So handsome.

1680
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:40,760
Jordan.

1681
01:25:40,760 --> 01:25:42,560
This is Charlie.

1682
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:45,760
- Oh...

1683
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:02,440
- I'm-- I'm sorry.
Am I--

1684
01:26:02,440 --> 01:26:04,520
Do you two know each other?

1685
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:06,520
<i>- And that's how
the story ended.</i>

1686
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:08,400
Or, in a sense, how it began.

1687
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:11,360
- I told you I'd meet a man
from the future.

1688
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:13,120
<i>- Not bad, huh?</i>

1689
01:26:39,240 --> 01:26:41,800
<i>And as for the question
of destiny,</i>

1690
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:45,360
all I know is that even
when destiny really wants

1691
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:47,160
to accomplish something,

1692
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:48,680
<i>it can't do it alone.</i>

1693
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:50,840
<i>You still have to go
to that restaurant.</i>

1694
01:26:50,840 --> 01:26:52,840
You still have to show up.

1695
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:57,320
You still have to build
a bridge to the one you love.

1696
