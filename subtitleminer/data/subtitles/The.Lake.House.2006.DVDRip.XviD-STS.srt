1
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:11,396
You coming or not?

2
00:03:49,267 --> 00:03:52,703
-All right, I'll get her to you right away.
-Appreciate it.

3
00:03:53,906 --> 00:03:54,930
-Hi.
-Hi.

4
00:03:55,174 --> 00:03:59,406
Dr. Klyczynski to ER, stat.
Dr. Klyczynski to ER, stat.

5
00:03:59,645 --> 00:04:02,944
-Hi, excuse me.
-Yeah, just a minute, okay?

6
00:04:04,216 --> 00:04:07,674
-Fill this out for me and wait over there.
-No, I'm... I'm Dr. Forster.

7
00:04:07,886 --> 00:04:09,217
I was told to report here.

8
00:04:09,388 --> 00:04:12,846
You'll be covering 22 patients
on rounds today, this floor and the next.

9
00:04:13,058 --> 00:04:14,685
-Twenty-two?
-Quiet morning.

10
00:04:14,893 --> 00:04:17,761
If you get into trouble, beep me,
but don't make it a habit.

11
00:04:17,964 --> 00:04:20,455
The med students
will help you out with scutwork.

12
00:04:20,667 --> 00:04:23,397
What's he doing here?
I ordered an MRI, stat.

13
00:04:23,603 --> 00:04:27,164
-Transport said about four hours.
-He could be dead in four hours.

14
00:04:27,374 --> 00:04:29,569
Never mind. Dr. Forster, MRI.

15
00:04:29,743 --> 00:04:31,802
-A right, two lefts, elevator to two.
-Okay.

16
00:04:32,045 --> 00:04:34,445
Follow the signs.
Hustle back here for rounds.

17
00:04:35,415 --> 00:04:37,110
Dr. Kly...

18
00:04:38,752 --> 00:04:42,211
-Are you taking me somewhere?
-I certainly hope so, sir.

19
00:04:42,423 --> 00:04:45,187
-How are you feeling today?
-Am...? Am I gonna make it?

20
00:04:45,993 --> 00:04:48,086
Yes. Absolutely.

21
00:04:52,299 --> 00:04:54,199
Alex!

22
00:04:54,402 --> 00:04:58,736
I made my famous spinach pie.
The trailer's nice and toasty.

23
00:04:58,939 --> 00:05:00,804
I can't.

24
00:05:03,311 --> 00:05:07,270
Look, it's really cold out here.
Don't get sick on me or anything.

25
00:05:07,482 --> 00:05:09,973
I never get sick.

26
00:05:10,719 --> 00:05:14,917
So I heard you bought a house,
and apparently I'm the last one to know.

27
00:05:15,123 --> 00:05:16,522
I thought I mentioned that.

28
00:05:16,758 --> 00:05:18,453
Wait.

29
00:05:19,127 --> 00:05:20,424
Where?

30
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:22,927
Outside of town.
Up the shore a little bit.

31
00:05:23,131 --> 00:05:24,826
Up the shore? There's no houses...

32
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:28,970
Oh, God. You don't mean that thing
with the stilts and the...?

33
00:05:31,607 --> 00:05:34,940
-You all right?
-Yeah. Are you crazy?

34
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:38,975
Why would you take that house, Alex?

35
00:05:39,182 --> 00:05:41,844
It's made of glass. There's no privacy.

36
00:05:42,051 --> 00:05:43,712
Mona?

37
00:05:44,153 --> 00:05:46,451
Get yourself some boots.

38
00:05:49,258 --> 00:05:51,454
Hey, Gonzalez!

39
00:05:56,266 --> 00:05:58,200
-Four-thirty.
-You lost?

40
00:05:58,402 --> 00:06:01,462
-Yeah.
-Takes a while to get your bearings.

41
00:06:01,672 --> 00:06:04,800
-I'm Madhvi.
-Kate Forster. Hi.

42
00:06:05,008 --> 00:06:08,409
Oh, wrong floor.
Where'd you do your residency?

43
00:06:08,645 --> 00:06:11,409
Just a little community hospital
up on the North Shore.

44
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:35,606
Dear new tenant,
welcome to your new home.

45
00:06:35,841 --> 00:06:37,570
As the previous tenant, let me say...

46
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:40,745
...I hope you'll like living here
as much as I did.

47
00:06:40,946 --> 00:06:44,040
I filed the change of address
with the post office...

48
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,582
...but you know
what a crapshoot that can be.

49
00:06:46,819 --> 00:06:50,448
So if anything slips through, would you
do me a favor and forward my mail?

50
00:06:50,689 --> 00:06:54,352
I'd appreciate it.
My new address is below.

51
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,394
Thanks in advance. P. S:

52
00:06:58,597 --> 00:07:03,092
"Sorry about the paw prints by the front
door. They were there when I moved in.

53
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:06,596
Same with the box in the attic."

54
00:07:08,441 --> 00:07:12,707
Paw prints?
What the hell is she talking about?

55
00:07:26,794 --> 00:07:30,230
Hey, baby girl. Hi. Hi. Hey.

56
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:43,468
Fix the light.

57
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:46,606
Get dog food, huh?

58
00:07:47,649 --> 00:07:49,583
Get human food.

59
00:08:17,947 --> 00:08:21,144
Hey. Hey.

60
00:08:26,022 --> 00:08:28,183
Hey, come here.

61
00:08:37,301 --> 00:08:41,328
Sixty degrees on Valentine's Day.
Can't be Chicago.

62
00:08:41,538 --> 00:08:43,904
The TV says it's global warming.

63
00:08:44,074 --> 00:08:47,874
The icebergs start melting,
water covers the Earth.

64
00:08:48,078 --> 00:08:50,740
Thank God we won't live to see it.

65
00:08:52,149 --> 00:08:53,582
What's this?

66
00:08:54,385 --> 00:08:56,354
That's nothing.
It's one of your father's.

67
00:08:56,554 --> 00:08:59,990
-Dostoyevsky?
-Oh, yeah.

68
00:09:00,325 --> 00:09:06,662
It's about a guy who breaks the neck
of a poor woman with an axe...

69
00:09:06,865 --> 00:09:10,665
...and, so far, keeps wandering
around regretting it.

70
00:09:14,005 --> 00:09:15,472
This is good.

71
00:09:15,674 --> 00:09:19,076
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah. It's really good.

72
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:21,268
I'll meet you there.

73
00:09:21,514 --> 00:09:22,879
What are you thinking?

74
00:09:23,382 --> 00:09:24,781
My folks are coming into town.

75
00:09:25,017 --> 00:09:26,678
Nothing.

76
00:09:26,886 --> 00:09:31,118
When your father passed away,
it was hard. It still is hard.

77
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:36,227
Holding his books,
I feel like he's with me somehow.

78
00:09:36,429 --> 00:09:39,193
Knowing that he was once
on the same pages...

79
00:09:39,398 --> 00:09:41,560
...reading the same words.

80
00:09:46,807 --> 00:09:50,402
Oh, my God!
Somebody call an ambulance!

81
00:09:51,111 --> 00:09:52,772
We need an ambulance at Daley Plaza.

82
00:09:53,013 --> 00:09:55,948
A man has been struck by a bus.
Get an EMT crew here. Sir...

83
00:09:56,149 --> 00:09:58,014
Get out the street.
Get on the sidewalk.

84
00:09:58,218 --> 00:10:00,015
-On the sidewalk. Off the street.
-Sir?

85
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,745
Get on the sidewalk!
Get on the sidewalk!

86
00:10:02,923 --> 00:10:06,223
I'd like to get the foundation
on number 17 dug today.

87
00:10:06,828 --> 00:10:09,592
Look, I know you're
kind of new around here, kid.

88
00:10:09,797 --> 00:10:11,424
What?

89
00:10:11,632 --> 00:10:14,760
I can't get to 17 until
at least next week.

90
00:10:14,969 --> 00:10:17,961
Come on, Mulhern.
That's bullshit and you know it.

91
00:10:18,172 --> 00:10:20,470
Take Clemens and Rodriguez
off of roofing.

92
00:10:20,675 --> 00:10:23,337
Jorge can run the backhoe
they're not using on 14...

93
00:10:23,578 --> 00:10:25,739
...and grab four or five
of those other guys...

94
00:10:25,947 --> 00:10:28,246
...who are doing nothing
on seven and 10.

95
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:32,045
Paulie, Carlos, Frank, Danny,
and what's-his-name, the tall guy?

96
00:10:32,254 --> 00:10:34,745
-Rafael.
-Rafael.

97
00:10:34,957 --> 00:10:37,755
-Let's go.
-Okay.

98
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,484
-Ready?
-Yeah.

99
00:10:39,695 --> 00:10:42,027
-Well, I need it to 10 and 11.
-Hey!

100
00:10:45,634 --> 00:10:48,501
Housekeeping ER
to the Suture Room, please.

101
00:10:48,704 --> 00:10:52,197
Housekeeping ER to the Suture Room.

102
00:10:55,145 --> 00:10:57,807
-Hey.
-Hi.

103
00:10:58,014 --> 00:11:00,847
I heard about Daley Plaza.

104
00:11:01,718 --> 00:11:04,380
EMT said you fought hard for the guy.

105
00:11:04,854 --> 00:11:07,789
Yeah. Really knocked myself out.

106
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:12,519
Kate, I'm going to tell you
what I tell every young doctor.

107
00:11:12,729 --> 00:11:15,722
Hopefully, you'll be the first to listen.

108
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:21,632
On your day off, get as far away
from this place as you can.

109
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:27,141
Go someplace where you feel
most like yourself.

110
00:12:22,034 --> 00:12:24,162
Dear Ms. Forster:

111
00:12:24,371 --> 00:12:25,702
I got your note...

112
00:12:25,906 --> 00:12:29,171
...and I'm afraid there must be
some kind of misunderstanding.

113
00:12:29,376 --> 00:12:33,312
As far as I know, the lake house
has been empty for several years.

114
00:12:33,547 --> 00:12:37,074
Maybe your note was intended for
the Sandburg house down the shore...

115
00:12:37,284 --> 00:12:40,776
"...since no one has lived
in this house for years.

116
00:12:41,788 --> 00:12:44,916
But I'm curious about the paw prints."

117
00:12:50,765 --> 00:12:53,893
Dear Mr. Wyler, I'm very familiar
with the Sandburg cottage...

118
00:12:54,102 --> 00:12:56,627
...and I can guarantee
I never lived there.

119
00:12:56,838 --> 00:13:00,604
I'm old-fashioned, but I don't think a
cottage should be over 6000 square feet.

120
00:13:00,808 --> 00:13:02,776
So let me try again.

121
00:13:02,977 --> 00:13:06,140
I used to live at the lake house,
then I moved.

122
00:13:06,347 --> 00:13:09,977
Now I live at 1620 North Racine
in Chicago.

123
00:13:10,219 --> 00:13:13,245
I'd appreciate it if you would
forward my mail if you get any.

124
00:13:13,455 --> 00:13:17,221
Oh, by the way, it's 2006.

125
00:13:17,426 --> 00:13:20,020
Has been all year, ask anyone.

126
00:13:20,262 --> 00:13:22,730
2006?

127
00:13:23,299 --> 00:13:25,631
What does she mean, 2006?

128
00:13:26,302 --> 00:13:28,270
God.

129
00:13:28,537 --> 00:13:29,526
Oh, God.

130
00:13:32,676 --> 00:13:34,837
-Good morning, Mr. Wyler.
-Morning, Mr. Wyler.

131
00:13:35,045 --> 00:13:36,535
-Morning, sir.
-Morning, morning.

132
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,543
Hello, Mr. Wyler.

133
00:13:39,049 --> 00:13:41,017
Mr. Wyler.

134
00:13:41,818 --> 00:13:43,683
Sir.

135
00:13:45,956 --> 00:13:49,119
Well, obviously,
I derived my inspiration...

136
00:13:49,326 --> 00:13:52,557
...for the metaphor
of the fugue, the loop...

137
00:13:54,397 --> 00:13:56,059
Yeah.

138
00:14:15,886 --> 00:14:19,186
-Two hours of that shit. You kidding me?
-What are you talking about?

139
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:23,919
-He didn't say a word.
-Sadistic, bitter, bitter old man.

140
00:14:24,162 --> 00:14:27,097
I think you're being
a little overdramatic.

141
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:32,733
Where are you going?

142
00:14:41,546 --> 00:14:43,879
Man, I love that place.

143
00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:08,072
I can't believe that thing's
still running.

144
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:12,705
Yep.

145
00:15:14,048 --> 00:15:15,447
You look like shit.

146
00:15:16,283 --> 00:15:18,080
I missed you too.

147
00:15:36,905 --> 00:15:39,135
Hey, forget about him.

148
00:15:43,611 --> 00:15:45,636
-Condos.
-Riviera Estates.

149
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,643
-You're joking.
-I don't believe this.

150
00:15:47,882 --> 00:15:49,679
I come back after four years...

151
00:15:49,918 --> 00:15:51,784
...and I get this in front of me.
-What?

152
00:15:51,987 --> 00:15:54,114
My brother thinking
he's Frank Lloyd Whatever.

153
00:15:54,323 --> 00:15:56,291
-Oh, come on.
-Dad keeps you hostage...

154
00:15:56,492 --> 00:15:59,188
...in that little
mythmaking factory of his...

155
00:15:59,428 --> 00:16:02,761
...while you haven't built so much as
a phone booth or a hamster cage.

156
00:16:02,932 --> 00:16:04,627
That's funny you say that, actually.

157
00:16:04,834 --> 00:16:07,894
I have a hamster cage in mind.
A development of them, actually.

158
00:16:08,104 --> 00:16:11,267
Prefab, no foundations.
What do you think about that?

159
00:16:11,474 --> 00:16:14,672
See, that's what I'm talking about.
You have vision.

160
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:17,542
Speaking of which...

161
00:16:17,781 --> 00:16:21,046
...l'd like you to know
I bought a house.

162
00:16:21,218 --> 00:16:23,277
-Where?
-On the lake.

163
00:16:23,687 --> 00:16:25,655
A lake house.
So you are making some money.

164
00:16:25,822 --> 00:16:28,313
Well, it's a dump.
Been abandoned for years, but...

165
00:16:28,525 --> 00:16:30,789
So you got an abandoned,
haunted lake hou...

166
00:16:30,994 --> 00:16:32,552
That's as good a reason as any...

167
00:16:32,796 --> 00:16:35,560
...for selling out and joining
the flabby-developers' guild.

168
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:39,167
-How about this? I even got a dog.
-You got a dog?

169
00:16:40,371 --> 00:16:45,138
He just showed up at the house
from out of nowhere.

170
00:16:57,188 --> 00:16:59,884
-What are we doing here?
-I have to deliver a letter.

171
00:17:00,091 --> 00:17:04,529
It should be here.
1620 North Racine.

172
00:17:07,866 --> 00:17:09,527
But...

173
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:12,097
...there's nothing here.

174
00:17:14,273 --> 00:17:17,504
Are we meeting someone?
Does somebody live here? What?

175
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:19,605
Yeah.

176
00:17:19,845 --> 00:17:22,040
I thought so.

177
00:17:22,447 --> 00:17:23,675
Should we ring the bell?

178
00:17:42,635 --> 00:17:44,296
Dear Ms. Forster:

179
00:17:44,537 --> 00:17:48,235
I went to 1620 North Racine,
and it's not there.

180
00:17:48,642 --> 00:17:50,633
It's just a construction site.

181
00:17:50,878 --> 00:17:54,939
From the pictures it looks nice,
but not for another 18 months.

182
00:17:55,149 --> 00:17:57,117
What am I missing here?

183
00:17:57,318 --> 00:18:00,810
Maybe you got the address wrong,
because you got the date wrong too.

184
00:18:01,055 --> 00:18:03,888
You really wanna play this game.

185
00:18:04,725 --> 00:18:10,027
If you are truly in the year 2004...

186
00:18:10,732 --> 00:18:13,030
...then...

187
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:17,396
...be forewarned.

188
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:23,668
Remember that day?
You were not happy. Remember that?

189
00:18:24,846 --> 00:18:26,074
I know.

190
00:18:26,681 --> 00:18:29,616
Okay, my mystery correspondent,
I get it.

191
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:33,185
Just in case you really are
where and when you think you are...

192
00:18:33,421 --> 00:18:34,980
...you'll need this.

193
00:18:35,191 --> 00:18:38,490
There was a freak late snow that spring
and everyone got sick.

194
00:18:38,694 --> 00:18:43,324
So plenty of rest, lots of fluids.
Doctor's orders.

195
00:18:43,566 --> 00:18:46,433
Snow. Right.

196
00:18:51,107 --> 00:18:54,076
Yeah, come to papa.

197
00:20:30,378 --> 00:20:32,107
Jackie.

198
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,043
Jack.

199
00:20:35,449 --> 00:20:38,577
Jack, come on. Come on, girl.
Come on, come on. Jack.

200
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:27,995
"Lmpossible, I know. Not possible...

201
00:21:28,438 --> 00:21:30,429
...but it's happening."

202
00:21:40,818 --> 00:21:42,615
Okay.

203
00:21:46,857 --> 00:21:48,552
Where am I?

204
00:21:53,363 --> 00:21:55,490
Very clever.

205
00:21:57,501 --> 00:21:59,526
"The lake house."

206
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:02,963
The lake house. As you can see,
I, too, am at the lake house...

207
00:22:03,141 --> 00:22:06,304
...but I'm getting tired of these games
so I'm leaving, okay? Bye.

208
00:22:06,478 --> 00:22:07,706
Thank you. Bye.

209
00:22:10,281 --> 00:22:13,478
Maybe we should
introduce ourselves properly.

210
00:22:18,156 --> 00:22:22,024
I'm a doctor,
dedicated to curing the sick.

211
00:22:22,393 --> 00:22:24,088
At least, trying to.

212
00:22:25,231 --> 00:22:27,563
I'm an architect. I like to build.

213
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,598
And while I wouldn't say
my current project is ideal...

214
00:22:30,836 --> 00:22:35,899
...it allows me to be here, in this place,
and that's enough for now.

215
00:22:36,242 --> 00:22:40,201
But tell me something. If you're working
in a hospital in Chicago now...

216
00:22:40,412 --> 00:22:43,347
...where were you before, in my time?

217
00:22:44,116 --> 00:22:45,743
Two years ago, in your time...

218
00:22:45,951 --> 00:22:50,048
...I was working
in internal medicine in Madison.

219
00:22:53,093 --> 00:22:54,390
Tell me about the future.

220
00:22:55,395 --> 00:22:58,125
What's it like in the year 2006?

221
00:22:59,466 --> 00:23:02,196
I'm afraid the world's
pretty much the same.

222
00:23:03,403 --> 00:23:07,396
Of course, we all dress in shiny metal
jump suits and drive flying cars...

223
00:23:07,607 --> 00:23:11,338
...and no one talks anymore
because we can read each other's minds.

224
00:23:11,546 --> 00:23:14,640
But the truth is, man from the past...

225
00:23:14,882 --> 00:23:18,409
...not much has really changed
in 2006.

226
00:23:20,221 --> 00:23:23,918
Speaking of the past, though,
I've been thinking about the paw prints.

227
00:23:24,125 --> 00:23:28,323
-How is that possible?
-Well, I think we have the same dog.

228
00:23:29,096 --> 00:23:31,621
Oh, yeah? What's yours like?

229
00:23:31,866 --> 00:23:35,633
According to the vet,
mine is eight years old in my time...

230
00:23:35,871 --> 00:23:37,862
...six in yours.

231
00:23:38,373 --> 00:23:43,868
She's skinny, has sad eyes, snores,
and sleeps like a person.

232
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:46,377
I don't know why, but I call her Jack.

233
00:23:46,582 --> 00:23:48,573
Hello, Jack.

234
00:23:51,753 --> 00:23:54,313
It's nice out here.

235
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:57,822
Let's not go out for dinner.
Let's stay here.

236
00:23:58,027 --> 00:23:59,961
-Hey.
-We have to eat.

237
00:24:00,163 --> 00:24:02,757
What are you doing?
You're supposed to be asleep.

238
00:24:03,132 --> 00:24:04,326
I'll cook.

239
00:24:05,268 --> 00:24:07,395
I thought you didn't like to cook.

240
00:24:08,104 --> 00:24:10,299
No, I don't like to cook.

241
00:24:10,506 --> 00:24:12,531
Is she gonna marry him?

242
00:24:12,709 --> 00:24:16,338
-What do you think?
-I don't know. He's kind of old.

243
00:24:16,512 --> 00:24:19,709
-Where are you going?
-Okay, he's not that old.

244
00:24:20,283 --> 00:24:22,115
My mom's last boyfriend was bald.

245
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,219
He was nice...

246
00:24:24,388 --> 00:24:27,186
...but my mom didn't marry him.
-No?

247
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:30,291
"There's always something better
coming around the corner."

248
00:24:30,494 --> 00:24:32,860
That's what she says.

249
00:24:33,297 --> 00:24:36,858
Maybe that's what that lady should do.
Wait for something better...

250
00:24:37,067 --> 00:24:40,036
...to come around the corner.
-Maybe.

251
00:24:42,039 --> 00:24:45,806
But if she's not careful,
she could spend her whole life waiting.

252
00:24:46,745 --> 00:24:49,077
Do you want me to bring
anything back with me?

253
00:24:49,247 --> 00:24:51,875
Yes. What about
a nice bottle of wine...

254
00:24:52,651 --> 00:24:54,209
...to celebrate?

255
00:24:54,452 --> 00:24:57,478
-What time shall I come back?
-Seven o'clock.

256
00:24:57,689 --> 00:25:00,453
Sorry I haven't made it
to the mailbox lately.

257
00:25:00,659 --> 00:25:04,595
It's been a long week. All night shifts.

258
00:25:04,863 --> 00:25:07,958
Good to hear from you.
I thought you left me.

259
00:25:08,167 --> 00:25:11,898
You should know that you're
my only connection to the future.

260
00:25:12,538 --> 00:25:15,769
How come we never talk
about the things we like?

261
00:25:16,108 --> 00:25:19,600
Well, let's see.
Reading the classics to Jack.

262
00:25:19,845 --> 00:25:22,973
-Who's his favorite?
-Dostoyevsky.

263
00:25:23,182 --> 00:25:26,845
For me, this city,
on a day when the light is so clear...

264
00:25:27,053 --> 00:25:28,680
...that I can touch every detail...

265
00:25:28,888 --> 00:25:31,551
...every brick and window
in the buildings I love.

266
00:25:31,758 --> 00:25:36,354
Come on, take a walk with me
this Saturday. Let me show you.

267
00:25:36,563 --> 00:25:39,999
You're crazy. Why are you going
through all this trouble for me?

268
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,226
No trouble. Summer's here.

269
00:25:55,883 --> 00:25:59,546
Okay, your turn. Favorite things.

270
00:25:59,754 --> 00:26:02,587
Where to start? Okay.

271
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:05,884
When I smell the flowers
before I see them.

272
00:26:06,094 --> 00:26:10,394
When it starts to rain
just as the picnic is ending.

273
00:26:10,598 --> 00:26:14,466
And I love the smell of Jack's paws.

274
00:26:14,669 --> 00:26:17,298
You didn't forget
to mention your husband, did you?

275
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,767
Well, of course I love my husband,
who is also a doctor.

276
00:26:21,977 --> 00:26:24,411
Plastic surgeon
for small farm animals.

277
00:26:24,613 --> 00:26:26,911
Good. I'm married too.

278
00:26:27,116 --> 00:26:30,574
I've got eight children,
and none of them look like me.

279
00:26:30,786 --> 00:26:33,949
-I'm worried, Kate.
-I would be too.

280
00:26:34,356 --> 00:26:35,755
I'm single.

281
00:26:36,592 --> 00:26:38,355
Me too.

282
00:26:41,431 --> 00:26:43,262
Number 27.

283
00:26:43,466 --> 00:26:45,627
She's a beauty.
My father used to tell me...

284
00:26:45,835 --> 00:26:48,702
...she was the grandma
for all the houses in the city.

285
00:26:48,938 --> 00:26:52,374
He used to take me on walks
like I'm taking you now.

286
00:26:52,809 --> 00:26:56,074
-Alex?
-Kate?

287
00:26:56,279 --> 00:26:59,112
I wish we could have
done this walk together.

288
00:27:14,198 --> 00:27:15,995
So, what do you think?

289
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,734
He sounds like a nice boy.

290
00:27:18,903 --> 00:27:21,599
Sounds like a nice boy.
Anything else?

291
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:25,139
-He has wonderful penmanship.
-Mother...

292
00:27:25,309 --> 00:27:27,710
...look at the date on the letter.
The date.

293
00:27:27,913 --> 00:27:29,403
-You mean the time thing?
-Yes.

294
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:32,242
-That's just a detail.
-Just a detail?

295
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:44,420
About the...
The other day...

296
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:49,533
...it was not a good moment.
I was in a hell of a hurry.

297
00:27:49,869 --> 00:27:51,496
Of course.

298
00:27:52,905 --> 00:27:55,066
You've got some nice pieces here.

299
00:27:55,274 --> 00:27:59,074
Oh, yeah. Music's fine, music helps.

300
00:27:59,779 --> 00:28:01,440
It's like Nietzsche says:

301
00:28:01,681 --> 00:28:04,946
-"Life would be senseless..."
-"Without music."

302
00:28:05,852 --> 00:28:07,752
I guess I told you that, huh?

303
00:28:07,954 --> 00:28:09,387
Pour yourself a drink.

304
00:28:09,589 --> 00:28:12,855
Can you appreciate
a good wine by now?

305
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,960
You bet.

306
00:28:15,796 --> 00:28:18,890
You know, you'll have to forgive
your father for being curious...

307
00:28:19,099 --> 00:28:22,262
...but where have you been
all these years?

308
00:28:22,603 --> 00:28:25,868
I thought your Kerouac days
were behind you.

309
00:28:26,874 --> 00:28:29,672
-I'm sorry, what?
-What?

310
00:28:30,911 --> 00:28:33,402
Oh, you can come up, if you like.

311
00:28:42,123 --> 00:28:43,750
What are you working on?

312
00:28:43,925 --> 00:28:46,985
Oh, I'm just...
I'm just remembering things.

313
00:28:47,228 --> 00:28:49,890
It's not such an easy job,
let me tell you.

314
00:28:50,098 --> 00:28:53,067
Nor is it particularly innocent,
in my case.

315
00:28:53,268 --> 00:28:56,635
Your father is writing his memoirs.

316
00:28:58,339 --> 00:29:00,001
-Are we in it?
-What do you think?

317
00:29:00,175 --> 00:29:01,938
Do you wanna be?

318
00:29:03,078 --> 00:29:04,477
Do you?

319
00:29:04,713 --> 00:29:08,308
Of course.
You were all a part of your father's life.

320
00:29:09,585 --> 00:29:11,678
Why are you talking to me
in the third person?

321
00:29:11,854 --> 00:29:13,515
Well, l... I don't...

322
00:29:13,756 --> 00:29:17,089
Because I'm writing about myself,
I suppose. Why, doesn't it suit you?

323
00:29:19,962 --> 00:29:23,455
I thought you might like these.

324
00:29:25,368 --> 00:29:27,666
What are these?
Something you've been working on?

325
00:29:27,871 --> 00:29:30,738
No, they're... They're yours.

326
00:29:30,941 --> 00:29:35,002
From a house I just bought
on the lake.

327
00:29:36,046 --> 00:29:39,777
Oh, yes, I heard. They said
some sleazy little condo developer...

328
00:29:39,983 --> 00:29:41,974
...had snapped it up.

329
00:29:42,352 --> 00:29:45,618
Oh, come on. Indulge your father.

330
00:29:45,823 --> 00:29:48,815
Can't you take a little joke,
for God's sake?

331
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,957
Come on.

332
00:29:51,128 --> 00:29:52,857
Tell me.

333
00:29:53,331 --> 00:29:55,526
Where have you been?
I really want to know.

334
00:29:55,766 --> 00:29:58,257
I was trying to forget you.

335
00:30:00,004 --> 00:30:02,336
Or forgive you.

336
00:30:03,674 --> 00:30:05,835
Did you succeed?

337
00:30:08,146 --> 00:30:09,841
No.

338
00:30:14,186 --> 00:30:17,212
Let me know
if you need any help remembering.

339
00:30:19,224 --> 00:30:22,284
Oh, yeah, I will.

340
00:30:23,061 --> 00:30:26,690
Charging 360. Get 1 milligram of epi.
Have 300 amio ready in case we need it.

341
00:30:26,898 --> 00:30:29,526
-All clear?
-Clear.

342
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:33,797
Hold compression, start bagging.

343
00:30:34,007 --> 00:30:35,304
He's got a rhythm. Slow.

344
00:30:35,508 --> 00:30:38,102
-Do we have a pulse with that?
-We got a pulse, thready.

345
00:30:38,344 --> 00:30:40,244
-It's getting stronger.
-Long days, these days.

346
00:30:40,446 --> 00:30:43,176
I just worked 30 hours straight.

347
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:45,874
Every time I stop to take a breath...

348
00:30:46,085 --> 00:30:49,350
...I realize how isolated
I've let myself become.

349
00:30:49,522 --> 00:30:54,460
Believe me,
you can get a bit desperate.

350
00:30:56,096 --> 00:30:58,564
That one? Okay. There you go.

351
00:30:58,766 --> 00:31:02,964
Nice move. Very nice. Nice.

352
00:31:05,606 --> 00:31:08,632
It's not that I'm complaining,
I love my work.

353
00:31:08,876 --> 00:31:13,210
And our tour through Chicago
opened my eyes to its beauty.

354
00:31:13,414 --> 00:31:16,349
But my heart still misses
the lake house...

355
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:18,746
...and its trees.

356
00:31:19,654 --> 00:31:22,282
I miss those trees so much.

357
00:32:39,537 --> 00:32:43,064
Don't worry, Kate.
We'll be together in time.

358
00:32:43,307 --> 00:32:46,640
Even if we're far apart,
I'll find a way to be close to you...

359
00:32:46,844 --> 00:32:48,869
...and take care of you.

360
00:32:54,253 --> 00:32:56,050
Katerina.

361
00:32:57,489 --> 00:32:59,252
Take this.

362
00:32:59,725 --> 00:33:02,592
-You should eat more. You too skinny.
-I'm not too skinny.

363
00:33:02,761 --> 00:33:06,026
Remember how you used to eat
when you were little?

364
00:33:06,231 --> 00:33:07,960
-With your hands.
-Yes, I remember.

365
00:33:08,167 --> 00:33:11,000
Now, did you or did you not
write to each other?

366
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:13,270
-To your father?
-No, to Clark Gable.

367
00:33:13,506 --> 00:33:16,100
Yes, to Dad.

368
00:33:18,545 --> 00:33:20,274
I...

369
00:33:22,715 --> 00:33:24,239
What, Mom?

370
00:33:24,484 --> 00:33:26,475
Before your father...

371
00:33:26,686 --> 00:33:28,415
Yeah?

372
00:33:29,289 --> 00:33:33,487
-There was this boy.

373
00:33:35,428 --> 00:33:36,896
Did you love him?

374
00:33:37,731 --> 00:33:39,460
Yeah.

375
00:33:44,805 --> 00:33:47,399
Well, why didn't you marry him?

376
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:52,610
So that you could ask me
this question someday.

377
00:34:02,757 --> 00:34:04,816
Looks smaller.

378
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:09,025
When did he complete it?

379
00:34:10,065 --> 00:34:12,625
You weren't born yet,
and I was 8.

380
00:34:17,339 --> 00:34:20,399
Corbusier meets Frank Lloyd Wright.

381
00:34:21,109 --> 00:34:24,102
You know, Dad played cards
with both of them.

382
00:34:25,181 --> 00:34:28,639
-Sharing a joint.
-Yeah, well...

383
00:34:29,252 --> 00:34:31,186
Can't swim.

384
00:34:31,554 --> 00:34:35,251
There should be a stairway
down to the water, a porch, a deck.

385
00:34:35,825 --> 00:34:38,293
Here, you're in a...
In a box.

386
00:34:38,494 --> 00:34:41,759
A glass box with a view
to everything that's around you...

387
00:34:41,964 --> 00:34:43,431
...but you can't touch it.

388
00:34:43,633 --> 00:34:47,968
No interconnection
between you and what you're looking at.

389
00:34:48,171 --> 00:34:51,004
I don't know, you know.
He's got this big maple growing...

390
00:34:51,208 --> 00:34:54,200
...right in the middle of the house.
-Containment.

391
00:34:57,614 --> 00:35:01,277
Containment and control.

392
00:35:03,086 --> 00:35:07,113
This house is about ownership,
not connection.

393
00:35:07,724 --> 00:35:11,525
I mean, it's beautiful. Seductive, even.

394
00:35:11,729 --> 00:35:14,698
But it's incomplete.

395
00:35:17,001 --> 00:35:18,832
It was all about him.

396
00:35:20,505 --> 00:35:22,905
Dad knew how to build a house,
not a home.

397
00:35:23,908 --> 00:35:25,239
But you know...

398
00:35:25,977 --> 00:35:28,411
...I think he wants us to do
what he couldn't.

399
00:35:29,113 --> 00:35:31,206
But admitting that...

400
00:35:31,916 --> 00:35:35,978
...would mean admitting
that he came up short in some way...

401
00:35:36,188 --> 00:35:38,053
...that he could do more.

402
00:35:38,257 --> 00:35:40,316
And that tortures him.

403
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:44,151
Do you remember
being here with Mom?

404
00:35:51,003 --> 00:35:53,062
I remember she tried
to make it work here...

405
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:56,206
...with us...

406
00:35:56,843 --> 00:35:58,435
...with him.

407
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:02,241
Hey, what about Visionary Vanguard?

408
00:36:02,415 --> 00:36:05,043
-What about it?
-Come on.

409
00:36:05,218 --> 00:36:09,086
You can't convince me you're gonna
be happy building saltboxes for tourists.

410
00:36:09,589 --> 00:36:11,853
Nobody's gonna admire you for that.

411
00:36:12,058 --> 00:36:15,118
-Admire me for that?
-Yeah, Visionary Vanguard.

412
00:36:15,895 --> 00:36:17,886
That's your idea.

413
00:36:18,098 --> 00:36:19,930
I can't. But you can keep the name.

414
00:36:20,101 --> 00:36:22,262
No, come on.
It's gotta be you and me.

415
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:25,234
Henry, I'm sorry, I can't.

416
00:36:25,439 --> 00:36:26,929
I just...

417
00:36:27,174 --> 00:36:30,371
-What?
-I've got other plans.

418
00:36:30,544 --> 00:36:32,569
You have a girlfriend?

419
00:36:34,415 --> 00:36:35,473
No...

420
00:36:35,649 --> 00:36:37,412
No.

421
00:36:37,785 --> 00:36:40,913
-What is that? You hesitated.
-No, I didn't hesitate.

422
00:36:42,724 --> 00:36:45,124
Come on, man.
I don't have any time for that.

423
00:36:46,628 --> 00:36:48,687
What does time have to do with it?

424
00:36:49,464 --> 00:36:51,830
Oh, you're gonna think I'm crazy.

425
00:36:56,772 --> 00:36:59,206
My dearest Mr. Wyler:

426
00:36:59,408 --> 00:37:02,138
Are you willing to play a game
with me?

427
00:37:02,778 --> 00:37:06,010
Two years ago today,
I was taking the 145 train to Madison...

428
00:37:06,249 --> 00:37:09,616
...from the Riverside station
and I forgot something there.

429
00:37:09,819 --> 00:37:12,344
It was a gift from my father.

430
00:37:12,822 --> 00:37:16,815
If you find it,
can you please put it in the mailbox?

431
00:37:17,827 --> 00:37:19,954
It would mean a lot.

432
00:37:20,263 --> 00:37:23,494
Yours, Kate.

433
00:37:39,249 --> 00:37:44,243
-Final call for the 5:46 to Madison.
-Do you really wanna know? Come on.

434
00:37:44,455 --> 00:37:46,650
-All aboard.
-Okay.

435
00:37:56,768 --> 00:37:58,360
I'll call you.

436
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:43,046
Kate, I found it. I have it with me.

437
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:45,946
One day I'll get it to you. Trust me.

438
00:38:46,186 --> 00:38:49,178
I know how important it is to you.

439
00:38:50,457 --> 00:38:53,893
You might not remember,
but we saw each other.

440
00:38:54,094 --> 00:38:56,187
At least, I saw you.

441
00:38:57,430 --> 00:39:01,595
You never told me
how beautiful you are.

442
00:39:01,836 --> 00:39:04,327
Well, maybe you saw somebody else.

443
00:39:04,539 --> 00:39:07,030
That was a bad hair year for me.

444
00:39:07,241 --> 00:39:10,574
Long brown hair.
Gentle, unguarded eyes.

445
00:39:10,778 --> 00:39:12,643
Okay, okay, okay.

446
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,711
You saw me.

447
00:39:15,383 --> 00:39:17,544
But I still don't know
what you look like.

448
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:22,578
Well, why don't we just get together
in the future...

449
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:25,453
...and you can let me know
what you think.

450
00:39:26,428 --> 00:39:28,225
It's a date.

451
00:39:31,433 --> 00:39:32,923
Okay.

452
00:39:33,135 --> 00:39:37,469
Why don't you call me
July 10th, 2006...

453
00:39:37,673 --> 00:39:42,906
...at 9:05 p.m.

454
00:39:57,594 --> 00:39:59,960
-Hello.
-Kate?

455
00:40:00,163 --> 00:40:02,996
-Yes.
-It's Morgan.

456
00:40:05,902 --> 00:40:07,494
Morgan.

457
00:40:07,704 --> 00:40:10,606
I'm in Chicago. I came for a meeting,
but it was canceled...

458
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:12,537
...so I thought I'd give you a call.

459
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:15,471
Hey, have you eaten?

460
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:19,171
-No, but I'm not...
-Neither have I. I realized I'm starving.

461
00:40:19,416 --> 00:40:21,976
-We could grab a quick bite.
-Okay.

462
00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:24,051
-Yeah?
-All right.

463
00:40:24,288 --> 00:40:27,917
-Hey, wait up.
-Watch out, man.

464
00:40:28,225 --> 00:40:30,989
-All right.
-Looks pretty good.

465
00:40:31,195 --> 00:40:32,662
-Perfect.
-No, Morgan, it's...

466
00:40:32,863 --> 00:40:34,195
-It's not.
-No, no, trust me.

467
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,900
It's... Okay.

468
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:39,632
Hi there.

469
00:40:39,838 --> 00:40:41,999
One sec.
Could you hold on for a moment?

470
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:44,573
-We'd love a table for two.
-The name?

471
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,309
We don't...
We don't have a reservation.

472
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,415
I'm sorry, sir,
we're booked until October.

473
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:53,642
October?

474
00:40:56,021 --> 00:40:57,751
Well...

475
00:40:58,391 --> 00:41:00,552
...l'll get back to you.

476
00:41:02,995 --> 00:41:04,860
That went well.

477
00:41:05,064 --> 00:41:07,328
It's no big deal.

478
00:41:11,337 --> 00:41:12,736
Oh, come on, stop it.

479
00:41:12,905 --> 00:41:15,840
It's the best restaurant in town.
Nobody gets a table here.

480
00:41:16,042 --> 00:41:19,569
-No, it's not that.
-Well, what is it?

481
00:41:23,083 --> 00:41:25,176
I didn't do this right.

482
00:41:26,219 --> 00:41:29,211
-There wasn't a meeting.
-You'd see me if there was no big deal.

483
00:41:29,423 --> 00:41:30,515
-Lf it was just...
-Ambush.

484
00:41:30,724 --> 00:41:33,557
-You know, coffee,
and coffee can turn into dinner...

485
00:41:33,727 --> 00:41:36,218
...dinner can turn into...
-Turn into what?

486
00:41:36,396 --> 00:41:38,626
I do sometimes
get a few steps ahead of myself.

487
00:41:38,865 --> 00:41:43,929
Morgan, a few steps?
You're always leaping 10 steps ahead.

488
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:47,230
We were dating, what, a week?

489
00:41:47,442 --> 00:41:50,377
And you had our entire future
mapped out for us?

490
00:41:51,145 --> 00:41:54,637
In my residency, you were picking out
real estate. I'd go to your house...

491
00:41:54,882 --> 00:41:58,147
...you'd have the entire town
in your house to meet me.

492
00:41:58,386 --> 00:42:02,220
I do seem to remember that you made
pretty fast friends with one of them.

493
00:42:02,423 --> 00:42:03,651
What are you talking about?

494
00:42:03,891 --> 00:42:05,324
You know what
I'm talking about.

495
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,550
-That guy.
-What guy?

496
00:42:06,762 --> 00:42:10,129
-The guy I caught you making out with.
-I wasn't making out with him.

497
00:42:10,332 --> 00:42:12,425
What, are we in junior high school
right now?

498
00:42:12,634 --> 00:42:14,625
What do you call it, then?

499
00:42:14,837 --> 00:42:17,431
A kiss.

500
00:42:17,639 --> 00:42:21,666
It was just one kiss
with some random guy that just...

501
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:23,241
Years... You know what?

502
00:42:23,412 --> 00:42:24,970
Gentlemen...

503
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:29,777
...unit 381 on Riviera Estates
is complete.

504
00:42:31,621 --> 00:42:34,488
Congratulations.
You did a good job.

505
00:42:36,626 --> 00:42:39,595
-One down...
-Forty-four to go.

506
00:42:39,796 --> 00:42:44,130
We're not terrifyingly behind schedule,
just alarmingly.

507
00:42:44,334 --> 00:42:47,064
It'll be okay.
The guys are getting to know their job...

508
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:49,500
...but we could use
another backhoe.

509
00:42:49,706 --> 00:42:51,606
And the water on 14
needs to be resealed.

510
00:42:51,808 --> 00:42:53,299
Shut up.

511
00:42:53,511 --> 00:42:56,674
-What?
-I'm kind of disappointed in you.

512
00:42:56,881 --> 00:43:00,180
-Why?
-You're supposed to be on top of things.

513
00:43:00,384 --> 00:43:04,115
-I thought I was.
-Well, you never noticed these.

514
00:43:05,322 --> 00:43:06,949
Remember?
You told me to get them.

515
00:43:07,291 --> 00:43:08,656
Right, right.

516
00:43:09,326 --> 00:43:11,191
Not exactly what I had in mind, but...

517
00:43:11,629 --> 00:43:13,859
-You like them?
-I like them.

518
00:43:14,098 --> 00:43:19,036
I think we should go out. Tonight.
If you're not doing any...

519
00:43:19,204 --> 00:43:21,399
Jack? Jack.

520
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,005
Hey, Jack.

521
00:43:26,511 --> 00:43:28,376
Jack!

522
00:43:28,847 --> 00:43:30,838
Come on, Jack!

523
00:43:31,249 --> 00:43:33,979
Alex, wait for me!

524
00:43:34,619 --> 00:43:36,484
Jack!

525
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,494
Jack!

526
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:44,891
Jack!

527
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:58,143
Jack!

528
00:44:05,853 --> 00:44:09,721
-Yours, I take it?
-Yeah. Yeah, sorry. Thanks.

529
00:44:09,957 --> 00:44:11,288
Come here, Jack.

530
00:44:11,459 --> 00:44:14,519
What were you thinking, huh, girl?
What were you thinking?

531
00:44:14,695 --> 00:44:17,687
-She's never run off like that.
-You gotta keep an eye on them.

532
00:44:17,932 --> 00:44:19,991
-What's his name?
-Her. Jack.

533
00:44:20,201 --> 00:44:22,294
Jack. It's a good name for a girl.

534
00:44:22,470 --> 00:44:25,497
I should get one like you
for my girlfriend. She loves dogs.

535
00:44:25,707 --> 00:44:28,369
-Hey, have we met before?
-No, don't think so.

536
00:44:28,577 --> 00:44:31,705
-Morgan Price.
-Alex Wyler.

537
00:44:32,014 --> 00:44:34,039
-Hey, man, you need a hand with this?
-Yeah.

538
00:44:34,249 --> 00:44:35,648
-Okay.
-Lived here long?

539
00:44:35,851 --> 00:44:38,081
Just a few months.
I've got a place on the lake.

540
00:44:38,253 --> 00:44:41,654
-The lake, really? I've been thinking...
-Alex. Oh, good.

541
00:44:42,557 --> 00:44:45,048
-Thank God you found him.
-Yeah.

542
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:47,228
Mona, Morgan. Morgan, Mona.

543
00:44:47,462 --> 00:44:49,454
-Well, hello.
-Hi.

544
00:44:49,666 --> 00:44:51,759
-It's good to meet you.
-Nice to meet you too.

545
00:44:52,001 --> 00:44:53,400
Nice boots there.

546
00:44:53,603 --> 00:44:56,504
Just so you don't think
I'm gonna drink all this by myself...

547
00:44:56,706 --> 00:45:00,403
...l'm having friends over tonight for
a party. You two are welcome to come.

548
00:45:01,844 --> 00:45:03,368
Oh, hey, Alex.

549
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,345
Take my card. I might be looking...

550
00:45:06,549 --> 00:45:08,847
...to rent a place on the lake myself.
-Okay.

551
00:45:09,052 --> 00:45:12,284
It's Kate, my girlfriend,
she's never really liked this place...

552
00:45:12,523 --> 00:45:16,857
...and I promised we'd look for something
new once she finishes her residency.

553
00:45:17,027 --> 00:45:18,927
So if you hear of anything...

554
00:45:19,897 --> 00:45:22,866
-Sure. She's a doctor?
-Yeah.

555
00:45:24,201 --> 00:45:25,566
Alex.

556
00:45:32,076 --> 00:45:34,511
-Great to meet you, Morgan.
-Great to meet you.

557
00:45:37,515 --> 00:45:40,279
Hey, Morgan,
what time's that party at?

558
00:45:40,452 --> 00:45:43,649
Eight o'clock. It's Kate's birthday.

559
00:45:49,294 --> 00:45:50,955
It's Kate birthday.

560
00:45:51,162 --> 00:45:53,130
Come on, Jack.

561
00:46:20,126 --> 00:46:21,116
-Hi.
-Hi.

562
00:46:21,328 --> 00:46:24,320
-What can I get you?
-Glass of white wine, please.

563
00:46:33,473 --> 00:46:35,805
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

564
00:46:56,030 --> 00:46:58,692
According to most accepted
social norms...

565
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:03,030
...a person should not drink alone
after 10 p. M...

566
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:05,637
...unless they have a good excuse.

567
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,809
What's yours?

568
00:47:08,143 --> 00:47:10,373
Gosh, don't have one.

569
00:47:10,612 --> 00:47:12,341
I do.

570
00:47:12,681 --> 00:47:15,741
My youngest left for college
this morning.

571
00:47:15,984 --> 00:47:17,747
Marie.

572
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:21,581
One day she's splashing
around a wading pool in diapers...

573
00:47:21,757 --> 00:47:26,057
...then she's packing up a Volvo
and driving to California.

574
00:47:27,029 --> 00:47:30,329
I just hope she knows
what she's getting into.

575
00:47:30,667 --> 00:47:32,191
Don't tell me.

576
00:47:32,402 --> 00:47:34,370
-Premed?
-Bingo.

577
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:40,507
-Hey, how are you? Good to see you.
-I'm well, thanks.

578
00:47:40,710 --> 00:47:42,701
I want you to meet
some friends of mine.

579
00:47:42,912 --> 00:47:45,710
Alex, Mona, the Wootch.

580
00:47:45,882 --> 00:47:47,611
-Susan, Johnny.
-Hi.

581
00:47:47,784 --> 00:47:50,582
Let's get you something to drink.
Come on. Bar's back here.

582
00:47:50,787 --> 00:47:52,948
Come on.
Hey, this is Marjorie.

583
00:47:53,591 --> 00:47:55,252
Why didn't you mention it was today?

584
00:47:55,459 --> 00:47:57,586
We would have had a cake for you
or something.

585
00:47:57,795 --> 00:47:59,695
Oh, it's just time passing.

586
00:47:59,897 --> 00:48:01,922
I hate making a big deal out of it.

587
00:48:02,166 --> 00:48:04,464
You keep a lot to yourself.

588
00:48:04,702 --> 00:48:06,897
Nothing wrong with it.

589
00:48:07,204 --> 00:48:11,800
But I've sometimes wondered what else
you have in your life besides work.

590
00:48:12,042 --> 00:48:13,942
Family? Boyfriend?

591
00:48:14,178 --> 00:48:16,773
Well, I did. Once.

592
00:48:17,182 --> 00:48:19,707
His name was Morgan.

593
00:48:19,918 --> 00:48:22,216
Morgan? Morgan.

594
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:24,718
That's a sexy name.

595
00:48:26,825 --> 00:48:29,419
Surprise!

596
00:48:33,431 --> 00:48:35,763
Happy birthday, Kate.

597
00:48:36,434 --> 00:48:40,235
-Happy birthday.
-Happy birthday.

598
00:48:41,307 --> 00:48:44,140
We got you.

599
00:48:44,310 --> 00:48:46,972
-This is Kate, obviously.
-Hi, Kate.

600
00:48:51,851 --> 00:48:53,250
This is Alex and Mona.

601
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:55,009
-Hi.
-Hi.

602
00:48:55,254 --> 00:48:57,347
This guy's gonna help us
find our lake house.

603
00:48:57,757 --> 00:48:58,951
Right?

604
00:49:01,928 --> 00:49:03,453
You haven't had cake.

605
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:06,030
Anyway, well, I ended it.

606
00:49:06,199 --> 00:49:10,363
And I'm happy now,
and it was the right thing to do.

607
00:49:11,138 --> 00:49:14,539
So who is it you write to?

608
00:49:14,775 --> 00:49:17,938
I couldn't help... Every time you get
a break at the hospital...

609
00:49:18,111 --> 00:49:20,978
...you're writing something.
-There is someone.

610
00:49:21,148 --> 00:49:24,549
It's kind of
a long-distance relationship.

611
00:49:24,885 --> 00:49:26,820
-How did you meet?
-We haven't.

612
00:49:27,021 --> 00:49:28,682
-What?
-No.

613
00:49:28,890 --> 00:49:31,051
-The story of my life.
-You're kidding.

614
00:49:31,225 --> 00:49:33,693
Keep everything at a distance.

615
00:49:33,895 --> 00:49:36,022
Everyone.

616
00:49:36,264 --> 00:49:38,129
The man who was standing
in front of me...

617
00:49:38,299 --> 00:49:40,062
...the one that wanted to marry me...

618
00:49:40,301 --> 00:49:42,701
...him, I push away. I run from him.

619
00:49:42,870 --> 00:49:45,805
In the meantime, the...

620
00:49:46,007 --> 00:49:49,136
The one man I can never meet...

621
00:49:49,812 --> 00:49:54,306
...him, I would like to give
my whole heart to.

622
00:49:56,018 --> 00:49:59,146
He must write one hell of a letter.

623
00:49:59,722 --> 00:50:01,656
It's nice.

624
00:50:03,325 --> 00:50:04,690
It's safe.

625
00:50:04,893 --> 00:50:07,225
-Christ, he's in prison, isn't he?
-No.

626
00:50:07,429 --> 00:50:09,556
-You're one of those women, aren't you?
-No.

627
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:14,065
No, he's just a guy who lives on a lake.
He's an architect.

628
00:50:37,094 --> 00:50:39,028
Oh, my God.

629
00:50:44,902 --> 00:50:46,961
Happy birthday.

630
00:50:48,773 --> 00:50:50,570
Thank you.

631
00:50:51,275 --> 00:50:54,870
-I hope it's a great year for you.
-Thank you.

632
00:50:56,914 --> 00:50:58,712
I'm Alex.

633
00:50:59,785 --> 00:51:01,082
The lake-house guy.

634
00:51:01,286 --> 00:51:03,880
Oh, yeah. How you doing?

635
00:51:16,501 --> 00:51:18,093
May I?

636
00:51:25,478 --> 00:51:28,470
So you're gonna... You're gonna
find us a place on the lake, huh?

637
00:51:28,681 --> 00:51:29,978
-I hope so.
-Yeah.

638
00:51:30,183 --> 00:51:31,514
If I can.

639
00:51:31,751 --> 00:51:33,616
You're a real-estate agent?

640
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:37,813
No, l...
I just have a lake house.

641
00:51:38,891 --> 00:51:40,017
Is it nice?

642
00:51:40,259 --> 00:51:43,695
Yeah, you'll love it.
You're gonna rent it after I move out.

643
00:51:43,930 --> 00:51:45,193
Oh, really?

644
00:51:50,037 --> 00:51:53,302
Kate, have you...

645
00:51:54,007 --> 00:51:56,202
...read Persuasion?

646
00:52:00,047 --> 00:52:01,344
What?

647
00:52:01,548 --> 00:52:04,312
-By Jane Austen.
-I know who it's by.

648
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:08,453
Yeah, it's...
It's my favorite book.

649
00:52:08,656 --> 00:52:11,989
Why did you bring something like that up?
What made you bring that up?

650
00:52:12,193 --> 00:52:16,960
I just... A friend of mine gave it
to me recently, and I was wondering...

651
00:52:17,532 --> 00:52:19,466
...what it was about.

652
00:52:21,169 --> 00:52:23,228
It's... It's wonderful.

653
00:52:23,471 --> 00:52:24,995
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

654
00:52:25,206 --> 00:52:27,299
It's about...

655
00:52:28,443 --> 00:52:30,308
About waiting.

656
00:52:33,182 --> 00:52:35,673
These two people, they...
They... They meet.

657
00:52:35,885 --> 00:52:40,083
They almost fall in love,
but the timing isn't right.

658
00:52:40,322 --> 00:52:42,552
They... They have to part.

659
00:52:42,858 --> 00:52:44,689
And then...

660
00:52:45,094 --> 00:52:47,028
...years later, they...
They meet again.

661
00:52:47,229 --> 00:52:49,527
They get another chance.

662
00:52:51,233 --> 00:52:54,965
You know, but they don't know
if too much time has passed.

663
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:57,902
If they waited too long, if it's...

664
00:52:58,108 --> 00:53:02,408
...you know,
too late to make it work.

665
00:53:06,616 --> 00:53:08,584
Why do you like that?

666
00:53:08,785 --> 00:53:10,685
I don't know.

667
00:53:10,887 --> 00:53:13,253
Don't get me wrong.
It's beautiful in a kind of...

668
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:16,550
-No, it's terrible.
-It's terrible.

669
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:20,026
-That's terrible.
-It's terrible.

670
00:53:20,264 --> 00:53:21,856
That's...

671
00:53:22,066 --> 00:53:24,762
Yeah, it's... That's terrible.

672
00:53:25,770 --> 00:53:28,034
It's a personal question...

673
00:53:28,239 --> 00:53:32,573
...but have you ever been
through anything like that?

674
00:53:32,777 --> 00:53:35,644
-Me? No. No, no.
-No.

675
00:53:41,587 --> 00:53:43,418
When I was...

676
00:53:44,056 --> 00:53:46,286
When I was 16...

677
00:53:47,826 --> 00:53:51,592
...I was completely in love
with this guy.

678
00:53:52,598 --> 00:53:54,589
He played guitar...

679
00:53:55,634 --> 00:53:57,465
...and I ran away from home...

680
00:53:57,669 --> 00:54:01,230
...and went to San Francisco
so I could go live with him.

681
00:54:02,441 --> 00:54:05,673
Yeah, he convinced me
I had a beautiful voice...

682
00:54:07,146 --> 00:54:09,944
...and I dreamed of becoming a singer.

683
00:54:11,651 --> 00:54:13,278
I love San Francisco.

684
00:54:13,486 --> 00:54:16,421
Yeah, he was...
He was my first love.

685
00:54:17,757 --> 00:54:20,089
Probably the only one.

686
00:54:21,628 --> 00:54:25,758
-He must have been a great guy.
-I don't... I don't know, l...

687
00:54:26,065 --> 00:54:29,297
He may have been. It didn't last
long enough for me to find out.

688
00:54:29,503 --> 00:54:32,301
Yeah. Truth is, l...

689
00:54:32,573 --> 00:54:35,440
I can't even remember
what he looked like.

690
00:54:35,976 --> 00:54:37,671
-Really?
-Yeah.

691
00:54:37,878 --> 00:54:39,573
Then that's too bad.

692
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:43,113
My dad... My dad showed up, actually.

693
00:54:43,317 --> 00:54:44,841
-You were in trouble.
-He came in.

694
00:54:45,085 --> 00:54:48,612
Yeah, I was in trouble.
He yanked me back to Chicago.

695
00:54:49,023 --> 00:54:50,787
Yeah.

696
00:54:51,826 --> 00:54:54,317
And he was sick, and he...

697
00:54:54,529 --> 00:54:59,592
He had these... These dreams
of me becoming a doctor, you know?

698
00:55:02,237 --> 00:55:06,196
You know, and eventually,
they became my dreams too.

699
00:55:09,344 --> 00:55:11,244
He was right.

700
00:55:12,414 --> 00:55:15,509
You know, l...
I feel good helping people.

701
00:55:22,892 --> 00:55:24,985
Then he died.

702
00:55:30,032 --> 00:55:31,863
Kate.

703
00:55:34,203 --> 00:55:36,000
What?

704
00:55:44,247 --> 00:55:46,374
I...

705
00:55:48,885 --> 00:55:50,876
You...?

706
00:55:56,893 --> 00:55:58,918
I just...

707
00:55:59,162 --> 00:56:00,790
What?

708
00:56:05,069 --> 00:56:07,162
Do you know this song?

709
00:56:09,407 --> 00:56:11,068
Yeah.

710
00:56:15,713 --> 00:56:18,705
-Do you sing?
-No.

711
00:56:18,916 --> 00:56:22,113
Nobody wants to hear me sing.
You don't wanna hear me sing.

712
00:56:22,453 --> 00:56:26,117
L... I didn't mean, you know...

713
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:30,551
But, yeah.

714
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:36,827
But I can dance.

715
00:58:57,549 --> 00:58:59,039
Kate.

716
00:59:00,718 --> 00:59:02,242
Hey.

717
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:06,953
Alex was... Alex was just telling me
about the... The lake house.

718
00:59:08,594 --> 00:59:12,428
-Yeah, it sounds... Sounds really great.
-Great.

719
00:59:13,465 --> 00:59:15,433
Alex, it's late.

720
00:59:17,136 --> 00:59:18,899
Yeah.

721
00:59:19,104 --> 00:59:20,765
Yeah.

722
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:23,965
-Good night.
-Good night.

723
00:59:37,912 --> 00:59:38,901
It was you.

724
00:59:39,114 --> 00:59:41,480
-You working tomorrow night?
-Yeah.

725
00:59:41,683 --> 00:59:43,617
Why didn't you say anything?

726
00:59:43,818 --> 00:59:47,720
You would've thought
I was crazy or drunk. Or both.

727
00:59:47,956 --> 00:59:49,685
Yeah, but...

728
00:59:50,458 --> 00:59:52,859
...I liked you.
You should have said something.

729
00:59:53,062 --> 00:59:55,929
How? You were with your boyfriend.

730
00:59:56,132 --> 00:59:59,033
You know what? Excuses, excuses.
You are a coward.

731
00:59:59,235 --> 01:00:01,135
I'm not a coward.

732
01:00:01,337 --> 01:00:05,239
Oh, really?
Well, what about your girlfriend?

733
01:00:05,741 --> 01:00:07,572
What? I told you already...

734
01:00:07,810 --> 01:00:10,938
...she's not my girlfriend.
-He's not my boyfriend either.

735
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:14,844
Oh, really? Well, what is he, then?
Your brother?

736
01:00:15,719 --> 01:00:20,656
We have a comedian. What'd you have,
a clown for breakfast this morning?

737
01:00:22,325 --> 01:00:24,384
Wonderful. Our first fight.

738
01:00:24,594 --> 01:00:28,553
You could write a song about it
and go sing it in San Francisco.

739
01:00:32,836 --> 01:00:34,599
What?

740
01:00:35,005 --> 01:00:36,472
Hello.

741
01:00:36,673 --> 01:00:38,608
Hey, Henry.

742
01:00:40,044 --> 01:00:41,375
What?

743
01:00:41,546 --> 01:00:43,411
You'll let me know if you need anything?

744
01:00:43,614 --> 01:00:45,411
Yes, I will.

745
01:00:46,751 --> 01:00:47,740
-Hi.
-Good afternoon.

746
01:00:47,985 --> 01:00:51,716
I'm looking for my father. I don't know
which room he's in. Simon Wyler?

747
01:00:51,923 --> 01:00:54,721
-Mr. Wyler, the architect?
-Yes.

748
01:00:54,926 --> 01:00:58,054
I'm Anna Klyczynski.
I'm the Attending for your father.

749
01:00:58,262 --> 01:01:00,423
Hey. What happened? How is he?

750
01:01:00,632 --> 01:01:05,126
He's okay. He's had a heart attack.
Fortunately, relatively minor.

751
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:08,533
His vitals are fine and he's stable...

752
01:01:08,707 --> 01:01:10,800
...but it will require an intervention.

753
01:01:11,043 --> 01:01:14,069
He's agreed to schedule it
for tomorrow.

754
01:01:29,095 --> 01:01:31,791
Good to see you're taking it easy.

755
01:01:32,599 --> 01:01:36,660
Well, you... You didn't need to come.
I'm perfectly well.

756
01:01:37,036 --> 01:01:39,095
Perfectly all right.

757
01:01:39,305 --> 01:01:41,739
Well, you had a heart attack, Dad.

758
01:01:41,941 --> 01:01:45,274
I had an episode, for chrissake.

759
01:01:45,478 --> 01:01:47,413
Nothing more.

760
01:01:48,115 --> 01:01:51,448
Appreciate it if you kept everything
in its perspective.

761
01:01:53,654 --> 01:01:57,055
Well then, I just wanna let you know
I'm here if you need anything.

762
01:01:59,193 --> 01:02:00,990
Coffee.

763
01:02:01,428 --> 01:02:03,123
What?

764
01:02:03,564 --> 01:02:05,361
You heard me.

765
01:02:07,768 --> 01:02:09,599
Coffee.

766
01:02:11,439 --> 01:02:13,669
There's something
I never told you, Kate.

767
01:02:13,875 --> 01:02:16,343
You see, it was my father
who built the lake house.

768
01:02:16,578 --> 01:02:19,604
I mean, with his own hands.

769
01:02:19,815 --> 01:02:22,648
And it was a long time ago,
before he was famous...

770
01:02:22,851 --> 01:02:26,082
...when he still had a family
and worshipped my mother.

771
01:02:26,288 --> 01:02:30,088
Her name was Mary,
and the house was a gift for her.

772
01:02:30,292 --> 01:02:33,126
She was smart and funny.

773
01:02:33,329 --> 01:02:36,992
She could have done anything, but chose
to take care of my brother and I...

774
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:38,997
...and help him build his career.

775
01:02:39,202 --> 01:02:43,229
You see, the more successful he became,
the more impossible he was to live with.

776
01:02:43,472 --> 01:02:47,033
Finally, she just couldn't take
living with him anymore.

777
01:02:47,243 --> 01:02:50,178
She left him.

778
01:02:50,379 --> 01:02:52,506
Within a year, she got sick.

779
01:02:52,715 --> 01:02:56,379
Unfortunately, she never learned
how to stop loving him.

780
01:02:57,621 --> 01:03:00,021
He wasn't at the funeral.

781
01:03:01,358 --> 01:03:03,622
When I asked him why...

782
01:03:09,366 --> 01:03:12,164
Go on, Alex. What did he say?

783
01:03:16,139 --> 01:03:19,871
He said, "She was dead to me the
moment she stepped out of the house."

784
01:03:22,881 --> 01:03:27,181
And then he gave me
one of his architect-of-the-year grins.

785
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:43,463
I hope you appreciate this.

786
01:03:43,702 --> 01:03:46,432
I had to sneak past
three nurses and your Attending.

787
01:03:46,672 --> 01:03:48,970
Oh, jeez, it's hot.

788
01:03:49,308 --> 01:03:50,707
It's not decaf, is it?

789
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:52,775
It should be, but it isn't.

790
01:03:56,482 --> 01:03:59,110
That's not bad. Thank you...

791
01:03:59,318 --> 01:04:00,945
...son.

792
01:04:01,186 --> 01:04:04,280
-You're welcome.
-Where's your brother?

793
01:04:04,456 --> 01:04:06,584
I sent him away.
He wasn't feeling well.

794
01:04:06,793 --> 01:04:09,694
-You know how he is, he worries.
-Yeah, I know.

795
01:04:09,896 --> 01:04:11,989
He gets that from your mother,
I'm afraid.

796
01:04:12,766 --> 01:04:14,233
She always worried too much.

797
01:04:14,434 --> 01:04:16,129
What are you looking at?

798
01:04:16,937 --> 01:04:18,734
Oh, yeah, here, take a gander.

799
01:04:18,939 --> 01:04:22,306
It's a proposal for a museum.

800
01:04:22,509 --> 01:04:25,706
-Who is it?
-Someone new.

801
01:04:26,613 --> 01:04:29,913
Oh, I like the walkways,
where the light falls.

802
01:04:30,117 --> 01:04:31,744
What are the materials?

803
01:04:32,153 --> 01:04:34,144
Granite. Aluminum.

804
01:04:34,355 --> 01:04:36,823
White panels
are straight out of Meier...

805
01:04:37,024 --> 01:04:41,358
...but the interior color coming through
the front windows, that's different.

806
01:04:42,196 --> 01:04:45,529
It's not new,
but it's clean, uncluttered.

807
01:04:45,766 --> 01:04:47,461
I like it.

808
01:04:48,035 --> 01:04:51,095
When was the last time
you were in Barcelona?

809
01:04:52,874 --> 01:04:55,342
Years ago, with you, Mom and Henry.

810
01:04:55,544 --> 01:04:58,172
Do you remember visiting
Casa de la Caritat?

811
01:04:59,348 --> 01:05:00,975
The almshouse.

812
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:03,651
That's right. You mentioned Meier.

813
01:05:03,852 --> 01:05:08,755
His Barcelona museum stands
in the same area as Casa de la Caritat.

814
01:05:08,957 --> 01:05:10,948
It drinks the same light.

815
01:05:11,159 --> 01:05:16,063
Meier designed a series of louvered
skylights to capture that light...

816
01:05:16,299 --> 01:05:21,066
...and cast it inward to illuminate
the art within, but indirectly.

817
01:05:21,304 --> 01:05:26,298
And that was important,
because although light enhances art...

818
01:05:26,509 --> 01:05:31,310
...it can also degrade it. But you know
all that already, you son of a gun.

819
01:05:31,481 --> 01:05:33,381
Now, this...

820
01:05:35,318 --> 01:05:37,343
...where do you suppose
this is to be built?

821
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:38,579
I have no idea.

822
01:05:38,756 --> 01:05:41,190
-Oh, but you said you liked it.
-Conceptually.

823
01:05:41,358 --> 01:05:43,588
Now, come on.

824
01:05:43,827 --> 01:05:46,489
You know as well as I do
that the light in Barcelona...

825
01:05:46,697 --> 01:05:49,063
...is quite different
from the light in Tokyo.

826
01:05:49,233 --> 01:05:52,327
And the light in Tokyo
is different from that in Prague.

827
01:05:52,536 --> 01:05:58,532
A truly great structure, one that
is meant to stand the tests of time...

828
01:05:58,742 --> 01:06:01,233
...never disregards its environment.

829
01:06:01,445 --> 01:06:03,243
An architect takes that into account.

830
01:06:03,448 --> 01:06:08,181
He knows that if he wants presence,
he must consult with nature.

831
01:06:08,386 --> 01:06:12,789
He must be captivated by the light.

832
01:06:12,957 --> 01:06:16,688
Always the light. Always.

833
01:07:12,286 --> 01:07:14,584
Hey. I have an emergency.
Take my shift. Please.

834
01:07:19,594 --> 01:07:21,118
Hello.

835
01:07:21,329 --> 01:07:23,957
-Mr. Wyler?
-Yes.

836
01:07:24,165 --> 01:07:27,362
This is Dr. Klyczynski
at Chicago City Hospital.

837
01:07:28,102 --> 01:07:31,594
I'm afraid I have some
difficult news for you.

838
01:07:34,409 --> 01:07:36,969
I'm so sorry, Alex.

839
01:07:38,213 --> 01:07:41,307
I wish somehow
I could be there with you...

840
01:07:41,850 --> 01:07:45,547
...that we could sit together and look
out over the water and the light...

841
01:07:45,787 --> 01:07:48,688
...in this house your father built.

842
01:07:51,693 --> 01:07:54,560
I could be a shoulder for you
like you've been for me.

843
01:07:54,796 --> 01:07:57,925
And tell you that
everything is gonna be okay.

844
01:07:59,836 --> 01:08:02,669
If I could do one thing for you today...

845
01:08:02,872 --> 01:08:04,931
...from here...

846
01:08:05,141 --> 01:08:08,736
...one small, simple thing
from the future...

847
01:08:09,345 --> 01:08:11,336
...I hope this is it.

848
01:08:12,749 --> 01:08:15,479
It won't be published
for a couple of years...

849
01:08:15,685 --> 01:08:18,347
...but I don't think
you should have to wait that long.

850
01:08:20,056 --> 01:08:23,026
I hope it helps you know
how much you were loved.

851
01:10:07,468 --> 01:10:09,868
Pick a place. I'll be there, I promise.

852
01:10:10,104 --> 01:10:11,435
Tomorrow, what do you say?

853
01:10:11,639 --> 01:10:13,470
But, Alex,
it won't be tomorrow for you.

854
01:10:13,675 --> 01:10:17,077
-You're gonna have to wait two years.
-I know, I don't care. I'll wait.

855
01:10:17,279 --> 01:10:18,610
Are you sure? I don't know.

856
01:10:18,814 --> 01:10:21,282
I do. I've never been so sure
of anything in my life.

857
01:10:21,483 --> 01:10:24,611
Okay. I'll see you in two years, then.

858
01:10:24,820 --> 01:10:27,084
See you tomorrow, then.

859
01:10:27,489 --> 01:10:29,184
Kate...

860
01:10:29,391 --> 01:10:31,382
...where would you like to go?

861
01:10:34,196 --> 01:10:35,857
II Mare.

862
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:38,022
When were you hoping
to dine with us?

863
01:10:38,233 --> 01:10:39,826
Two years from tomorrow.

864
01:10:40,036 --> 01:10:42,197
-Two years from tomorrow?
-Yeah.

865
01:10:42,405 --> 01:10:44,373
-Two years?
-From tomorrow.

866
01:10:46,343 --> 01:10:48,334
-Hi.
-Hello. Name?

867
01:10:48,511 --> 01:10:49,637
Forster.

868
01:10:49,813 --> 01:10:51,178
-Can I have your name?
-Wyler.

869
01:10:51,348 --> 01:10:53,908
Or Wyler, I'm...
I'm really not sure.

870
01:10:54,084 --> 01:10:56,314
I think we should be able
to accommodate you.

871
01:10:56,519 --> 01:10:57,577
-Great.
-Wyler?

872
01:10:59,756 --> 01:11:01,246
Wyler.

873
01:11:02,893 --> 01:11:05,361
Your waiter will be right with you.

874
01:11:29,521 --> 01:11:31,682
Good evening, miss.

875
01:11:33,358 --> 01:11:35,792
Complimentary.

876
01:11:46,071 --> 01:11:48,905
-Thank you.
-Good luck.

877
01:12:11,564 --> 01:12:13,931
Another glass for the lady?

878
01:13:41,591 --> 01:13:43,684
You weren't there.

879
01:13:44,027 --> 01:13:46,223
You didn't come.

880
01:13:52,603 --> 01:13:54,400
I don't understand.

881
01:13:54,605 --> 01:13:57,733
Something must have happened.
I'm sorry.

882
01:13:57,942 --> 01:14:00,809
I've got two years, Kate.
We can try again.

883
01:14:01,012 --> 01:14:05,244
No, Alex, it's too late.

884
01:14:05,449 --> 01:14:09,045
It already happened. It didn't work.

885
01:14:09,254 --> 01:14:11,188
Don't give up on me, Kate.

886
01:14:11,390 --> 01:14:15,087
What about Persuasion?
You told me. They wait.

887
01:14:15,327 --> 01:14:17,352
They meet again,
they have another chance.

888
01:14:17,563 --> 01:14:19,690
Life is not a book, Alex.

889
01:14:19,898 --> 01:14:22,389
And it can be over in a second.

890
01:14:22,601 --> 01:14:25,968
I was having lunch with my mother
at Daley Plaza...

891
01:14:26,204 --> 01:14:28,934
...and a man was killed
right in front of me.

892
01:14:29,141 --> 01:14:31,372
He died in my arms.

893
01:14:31,578 --> 01:14:33,102
And I thought:

894
01:14:33,346 --> 01:14:37,612
"It can't end just like that
on Valentine's Day."

895
01:14:38,551 --> 01:14:41,543
I thought about all the people
who love him, waiting at home...

896
01:14:41,754 --> 01:14:44,245
...who will never see him again.

897
01:14:45,158 --> 01:14:47,092
And then I thought:

898
01:14:47,293 --> 01:14:49,625
"What if there is no one?"

899
01:14:50,430 --> 01:14:55,926
What if you live your whole life
and no one is waiting?

900
01:14:56,437 --> 01:15:00,373
So I drove to the lake house
looking for any kind of answer.

901
01:15:00,574 --> 01:15:02,974
And I found you.

902
01:15:03,177 --> 01:15:05,611
And I let myself get lost.

903
01:15:05,813 --> 01:15:11,183
Lost in this beautiful fantasy
where time stood still.

904
01:15:11,652 --> 01:15:14,018
But it's not real, Alex.

905
01:15:14,254 --> 01:15:19,192
I have to learn to live
the life that I have got.

906
01:15:20,795 --> 01:15:22,990
Please don't write anymore.

907
01:15:23,198 --> 01:15:25,496
Don't try to find me.

908
01:15:26,434 --> 01:15:29,096
Let me let you go.

909
01:16:16,486 --> 01:16:18,317
Hello.

910
01:16:19,089 --> 01:16:22,024
What? Sorry, hold on.
I can't hear you. I'll be back, sorry.

911
01:16:22,225 --> 01:16:24,887
Hello. Hold on. Hold on.

912
01:16:25,328 --> 01:16:27,024
Hello.

913
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:31,330
Hi.

914
01:16:36,874 --> 01:16:39,069
How long are you here?

915
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:45,613
-I'm at a bar with some friends.
-Come.

916
01:16:45,850 --> 01:16:48,410
Well, don't get too excited.

917
01:16:49,855 --> 01:16:52,415
I find that hard to believe.

918
01:16:54,393 --> 01:16:55,860
It is good.

919
01:16:56,061 --> 01:16:59,053
And it was really good
to hear your voice.

920
01:16:59,264 --> 01:17:02,597
I was surprised how good
it was to hear your voice.

921
01:17:05,738 --> 01:17:07,228
So how was your meeting?

922
01:17:07,439 --> 01:17:09,566
-It was good.
-Yeah?

923
01:17:09,775 --> 01:17:12,608
Yeah, l... I got the job.

924
01:17:12,811 --> 01:17:15,144
-Really?
-Yeah.

925
01:17:15,582 --> 01:17:17,743
-Well, congratulations.
-Imagine that.

926
01:17:17,951 --> 01:17:23,583
Yeah. A telecom company.
I'll be in-house counsel. Pays well.

927
01:17:23,790 --> 01:17:25,883
And it's here...

928
01:17:26,092 --> 01:17:27,559
...in Chicago.

929
01:17:28,394 --> 01:17:30,123
Well...

930
01:17:30,330 --> 01:17:32,423
...it's great news.

931
01:17:34,801 --> 01:17:36,599
Hey.

932
01:17:40,574 --> 01:17:42,269
What?

933
01:18:02,464 --> 01:18:03,954
Jack.

934
01:18:04,166 --> 01:18:06,100
Hey, Jack.

935
01:18:06,434 --> 01:18:08,197
Jack.

936
01:19:28,653 --> 01:19:30,917
Are you gonna
come down this weekend?

937
01:19:33,092 --> 01:19:35,287
Don't you miss me a little bit?

938
01:19:35,961 --> 01:19:38,429
Oh, just a little bit. Not a lot, huh?

939
01:19:38,898 --> 01:19:42,561
Okay. No, I heard you. Yeah.

940
01:19:44,436 --> 01:19:47,701
Kate, I'm gonna
have to call you back, okay?

941
01:20:02,555 --> 01:20:04,989
Still wanna rent a lake house?

942
01:20:05,926 --> 01:20:08,258
It's what Kate wants.

943
01:20:08,461 --> 01:20:11,055
How the hell do you know
what Kate wants?

944
01:20:12,432 --> 01:20:14,093
Trust me.

945
01:20:25,980 --> 01:20:29,108
Hey, you. I know you.

946
01:20:35,456 --> 01:20:38,152
Whatever you want out back.

947
01:21:08,057 --> 01:21:09,888
What do you think?

948
01:21:10,493 --> 01:21:12,620
You're fixating. You know?

949
01:21:13,663 --> 01:21:15,494
Why do you keep
tweaking the lake house?

950
01:21:15,698 --> 01:21:17,791
Why don't you do your own work?

951
01:21:17,967 --> 01:21:20,197
Because it's hers.

952
01:21:20,570 --> 01:21:25,837
You're talking about the girl
from the future.

953
01:21:26,042 --> 01:21:27,704
Kate.

954
01:21:28,545 --> 01:21:31,309
And you're still writing with Kate?

955
01:21:31,682 --> 01:21:35,049
-No.
-Why not?

956
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:38,078
She asked me not to.

957
01:21:38,789 --> 01:21:40,484
Why?

958
01:21:42,793 --> 01:21:44,488
Time.

959
01:21:48,399 --> 01:21:49,923
Hey, come on.

960
01:21:50,167 --> 01:21:53,899
This is a good thing.
You know, you need a real woman.

961
01:21:54,105 --> 01:21:57,199
-A woman...
-Henry, listen.

962
01:21:58,410 --> 01:22:00,207
Listen to me.

963
01:22:00,678 --> 01:22:05,672
While it lasted, she was
more real to me than any of that stuff.

964
01:22:05,884 --> 01:22:10,014
She was more real to me
than anything I've ever known.

965
01:22:12,223 --> 01:22:14,055
I saw her.

966
01:22:14,927 --> 01:22:16,758
I kissed her.

967
01:22:19,131 --> 01:22:20,758
I love her.

968
01:22:23,936 --> 01:22:26,029
And now she's gone.

969
01:22:34,947 --> 01:22:36,710
She's gone.

970
01:22:44,124 --> 01:22:45,751
And Duckett squirts through.

971
01:22:46,259 --> 01:22:47,954
First thing...

972
01:22:49,496 --> 01:22:51,862
How could the Ab Scissor
four-minute ab machine...?

973
01:22:52,065 --> 01:22:54,727
-And your potatoes
cooking on the top.

974
01:22:54,935 --> 01:22:58,496
It's nice out here. Let's stay here.

975
01:22:58,738 --> 01:23:00,604
But we have to eat.

976
01:23:01,609 --> 01:23:04,806
We can eat here. I'll cook.

977
01:23:05,179 --> 01:23:07,443
I thought you didn't like to cook.

978
01:23:08,082 --> 01:23:10,380
No, I don't like to cook.

979
01:23:12,019 --> 01:23:15,318
But I have a chicken in the icebox,
and you're eating it.

980
01:23:15,523 --> 01:23:17,650
What about all
the washing-up afterward?

981
01:23:17,892 --> 01:23:20,452
-We'll eat with our fingers.
-Could you turn that down?

982
01:23:20,661 --> 01:23:22,094
Don't we need any plates?

983
01:23:22,296 --> 01:23:25,994
Yes. One for you,
and one for...

984
01:24:37,609 --> 01:24:41,045
"There could have been
no two hearts so open...

985
01:24:41,713 --> 01:24:44,511
...no tastes so similar...

986
01:24:45,717 --> 01:24:48,618
...no feelings so in unison."

987
01:25:03,202 --> 01:25:08,037
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six...

988
01:25:08,241 --> 01:25:12,735
...five, four, three, two, one.

989
01:25:12,945 --> 01:25:15,812
Happy New Year!

990
01:25:28,395 --> 01:25:30,158
Come in.

991
01:25:45,046 --> 01:25:46,673
Hi.

992
01:25:47,181 --> 01:25:48,671
Hi.

993
01:25:50,184 --> 01:25:51,617
What do you think?

994
01:25:51,819 --> 01:25:53,684
This is what I gave up lunch for?

995
01:25:53,921 --> 01:25:58,654
-I know it needs work.
-Work? How about a wrecking ball?

996
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:01,986
I found an architect
who specializes in renovations.

997
01:26:02,196 --> 01:26:04,630
I made an appointment for tomorrow.

998
01:26:09,138 --> 01:26:10,696
Ambush.

999
01:26:10,939 --> 01:26:12,201
Come on.

1000
01:26:12,441 --> 01:26:15,933
We can't stay in my apartment.
We've been there over a year.

1001
01:26:17,079 --> 01:26:18,808
I wanna keep moving forward.

1002
01:26:29,392 --> 01:26:32,691
-It's a new firm.
-"New" as in inexperienced?

1003
01:26:32,896 --> 01:26:35,660
No. "New" as in cheap.

1004
01:26:45,875 --> 01:26:48,241
Hi, Dr. Forster.
We'll be with you in a moment.

1005
01:26:48,478 --> 01:26:50,173
Great, thank you.

1006
01:27:03,928 --> 01:27:07,022
Oh, by the way...

1007
01:27:08,432 --> 01:27:10,559
...happy Valentine's Day.

1008
01:27:10,768 --> 01:27:13,896
Oh, God, Katie,
I didn't get you anything.

1009
01:27:14,138 --> 01:27:17,267
I'm sorry. I've just been
so swamped and...

1010
01:27:17,509 --> 01:27:19,409
Doesn't matter.

1011
01:27:35,927 --> 01:27:39,694
-What is this?
-It's global warming.

1012
01:27:41,934 --> 01:27:45,927
Dr. Forster?
Hi, I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

1013
01:28:04,725 --> 01:28:07,159
-Hi. Good to see you again.
-Dr. Forster. You too.

1014
01:28:07,394 --> 01:28:10,295
-Hi, I'm Morgan.
-Hey, Morgan. Vanessa Vanderbeck.

1015
01:28:10,497 --> 01:28:14,797
So obviously, the first thing you see
is what we had talked about. The atrium.

1016
01:28:15,502 --> 01:28:16,901
That's stunning.

1017
01:28:17,070 --> 01:28:20,597
So we were able to do it with all
the glass panels in the metal structure?

1018
01:28:20,808 --> 01:28:22,400
-Yeah.
-Can l...?

1019
01:28:22,676 --> 01:28:23,973
Wanna get a beer after work?

1020
01:28:24,211 --> 01:28:28,273
I'm sorry, I can't. I'm taking
Vanessa out for Valentine's Day.

1021
01:28:31,986 --> 01:28:33,476
Wait.

1022
01:28:34,022 --> 01:28:35,455
Say that again.

1023
01:28:35,657 --> 01:28:38,785
It's Valentine's Day today.
I'm taking out Vanessa, my girlfriend.

1024
01:28:38,993 --> 01:28:42,360
Cold champagne, some oysters,
maybe a little chocolate.

1025
01:28:42,597 --> 01:28:46,089
-What's the date?
-It's February 14th.

1026
01:28:47,001 --> 01:28:51,268
-February 14th, 2006.
-Yeah.

1027
01:28:51,874 --> 01:28:54,741
-Stunning. Thank you so much.
-Our pleasure.

1028
01:28:54,944 --> 01:28:57,378
Thank you. Henry will
make sure you have everything.

1029
01:28:57,613 --> 01:28:59,513
Great. They were absolutely beautiful.

1030
01:28:59,748 --> 01:29:01,238
Thank you.

1031
01:29:02,518 --> 01:29:04,008
What?

1032
01:29:05,488 --> 01:29:08,787
Katie, I gotta get back to work.

1033
01:29:11,761 --> 01:29:13,626
Who did this drawing?

1034
01:29:13,830 --> 01:29:15,957
My brother did, actually.

1035
01:29:16,132 --> 01:29:17,497
Who's your brother?

1036
01:29:17,701 --> 01:29:19,692
Alex Wyler.

1037
01:29:20,003 --> 01:29:21,766
Did you know him?

1038
01:29:23,907 --> 01:29:25,465
Yeah.

1039
01:29:26,409 --> 01:29:28,172
Yeah, I know him.

1040
01:29:30,680 --> 01:29:32,875
Do you know how
I can get in touch with him?

1041
01:29:33,083 --> 01:29:35,985
Is he...?
Is he anywhere that I can...?

1042
01:29:38,689 --> 01:29:40,554
I'm sorry.

1043
01:29:41,192 --> 01:29:45,219
He died...

1044
01:29:45,696 --> 01:29:48,392
...two years ago today, actually.

1045
01:29:51,702 --> 01:29:53,795
There was an accident.

1046
01:30:11,456 --> 01:30:13,048
Where?

1047
01:30:16,728 --> 01:30:18,218
Kate.

1048
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:23,034
Wait, just stop. Just stop.

1049
01:30:23,536 --> 01:30:25,629
Goddamn it, answer me.

1050
01:30:25,939 --> 01:30:29,966
What is the matter? Kate.

1051
01:30:32,645 --> 01:30:34,203
Kate!

1052
01:31:38,648 --> 01:31:41,674
Sixty degrees on Valentine's Day.

1053
01:31:41,917 --> 01:31:44,215
This cannot be Chicago.

1054
01:31:44,620 --> 01:31:47,646
The TV says it's global warming.

1055
01:31:48,024 --> 01:31:49,787
Nothing wrong with that.

1056
01:31:49,992 --> 01:31:51,721
It's a dangerous thing.

1057
01:31:52,161 --> 01:31:53,857
Alex...

1058
01:31:55,298 --> 01:31:58,199
...I know why you
didn't show up that night.

1059
01:31:58,435 --> 01:32:01,700
It was you at Daley Plaza that day.

1060
01:32:02,873 --> 01:32:04,670
It was you.

1061
01:32:05,575 --> 01:32:07,634
Please, don't go.

1062
01:32:08,712 --> 01:32:12,170
Just wait. Please.

1063
01:32:13,150 --> 01:32:14,515
Don't look for me.

1064
01:32:14,718 --> 01:32:17,051
Don't try to find me.

1065
01:32:19,223 --> 01:32:21,088
I love you.

1066
01:32:23,928 --> 01:32:27,557
And it's taken me all this time
to say it, but I love you.

1067
01:32:35,073 --> 01:32:36,700
And if you still care for me...

1068
01:32:38,576 --> 01:32:40,511
...wait for me.

1069
01:32:41,046 --> 01:32:43,037
Wait with me.

1070
01:32:43,248 --> 01:32:46,740
Just wait. Wait.

1071
01:32:55,494 --> 01:32:57,894
Wait two years, Alex.

1072
01:32:58,363 --> 01:33:00,695
Come to the lake house.

1073
01:33:01,066 --> 01:33:02,898
I'm here.

1074
01:34:00,095 --> 01:34:01,926
You waited.
