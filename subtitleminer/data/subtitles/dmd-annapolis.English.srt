Listen, stay away, stay away,
let's get out of the round.

00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:25,781
Just stay away.
Jake. Jake!

7
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:30,278
Jake!

8
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,183
That's it, punch him.
Come on.

9
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,920
One, two, three,

12
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:18,760
He's out.

13
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:33,338
- You look like you got your ass kicked.
- That's an early birthday present.

14
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:36,974
Oh, yeah? So when you started crying,
was that part of the present?

15
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,611
Son of a bitch.
Started crying? I would never cry.

16
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:46,057
He was down for eight, crawled back up.
I felt so sorry for him, I took a nap.

17
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:11,911
Hey, Jake.

18
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,711
Jake!

19
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:20,288
- You do the work on H-2?
- Yeah.

20
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,988
Well, your cross-weld seams got bubbles.

21
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:26,964
- They looked fine.
- Do 'em over.

22
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:50,180
Jake, there's some guy from the Naval
Academy out there looking for you.

23
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:52,121
- That's funny.
- I'm serious, man.

24
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:54,659
He's out there looking for you right now.

25
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:57,662
- He say what he wanted?
- No.

26
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:14,679
Excuse me, sir.

27
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:16,408
I'm Jake Huard.

28
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:19,815
Lieutenant Commander Burton,
United States Naval Academy.

29
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:24,016
Your application
made for some interesting reading.

30
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:27,253
- Thank you.
- I kept going over it,

31
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,057
to figure out why a congressman
would give a nomination

32
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:33,098
to someone with
such mediocre grades and test scores.

33
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:37,796
- He didn't want to give it to me at first.
- That's what he told me.

34
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:41,772
He also said you were
the biggest pain in the ass he'd ever met.

35
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:45,572
- I had to go back a couple times.
- How many?

36
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:49,237
34 straight days, sir.

37
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:57,154
We've had some spots open up
in this year's class.

38
00:05:57,223 --> 00:06:02,160
Couple kids decided last minute
they'd rather have fun at college.

39
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:04,253
Induction day is tomorrow.

40
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:08,925
I'm gonna be honest with you.
This is not an ideal situation.

41
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:12,698
You'll be way behind the other students.
They've had months to prepare.

42
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:15,263
That's all right, sir.

43
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:17,901
- Well, then, congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.

44
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:20,605
I'll see you tomorrow at 0630.

45
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:51,806
<i>(man)</i> I don't get it. I mean, I don't know
why you want to go to that place so bad.

46
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:55,507
I mean, we're rivets. We build ships.

47
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:05,119
Can you remember when my mom
used to take us there when we were kids?

48
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:08,251
Yeah, and we all wanted
to wear the uniform and be the hero.

49
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:11,125
But we were little kids then, Jake.

50
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:16,967
- Well, I never stopped wanting that.
- So, this place isn't good enough for you?

51
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:21,598
No, that's not it.
I just don't want to build ships.

52
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:24,871
And what happens if that doesn't work out?

53
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,936
It's gonna work out.

54
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:33,078
I mean, I got dreams too, man.

55
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:36,752
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

56
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:40,919
Like going to Sir Frankie's tonight
and getting shitfaced.

57
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:43,553
Tonight's your night.

58
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,961
<i>(loud rock music)</i>

59
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:52,595
We got plenty of room over at the VIP table
if you guys wanna join us.

60
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:54,299
All right, Romeo.

61
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:59,242
These girls are all over your Navy buddies,
man. Look at this place.

62
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,779
- Oh, yes.
- Al right.

63
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:02,246
- To Jake.
- To Jake.

64
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,805
To Jake.

65
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:09,649
Listen, guys. You're my best friends
for as long as I can remember.

66
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:15,820
That's why I gotta get outta here. If I can't
find better guys than you, I'm in trouble.

67
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:19,729
See you at Christmas.
Be good.

68
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:24,564
Yo, wait up.

69
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:30,572
Look at her. You see the girl over there
with the long black hair?

70
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:32,609
Yeah.

71
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,703
Couple of us chipped in.

72
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:39,606
- What, she's a hooker?
- No, she's not a hooker.

73
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:42,483
She's an escort.

74
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:44,386
Get outta here.

75
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:47,187
Look, I swear on my mother.

76
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:51,287
OK? Just go talk to her.
She ain't gonna bite you.

77
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,333
That cost too much.

78
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:00,402
Hi.

79
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,171
I'm Jake.

80
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:04,675
Ali.

81
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:11,649
So, look... This is probably, like,
business as usual for you,

82
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:15,585
but I've never
done anything like this before.

83
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:16,485
Uh...

84
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,717
Look, so you can just keep the money, I...

85
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:21,885
What are you talking about?

86
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:27,125
I swear on my mother.

87
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:33,700
- You're not a prostitute.
- Uh, no, I...

88
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:35,502
I am.

89
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,635
But I'm really late
for my next appointment, so...

90
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:43,944
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

91
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:47,850
I'm sorry. OK?
They did say you were really expensive.

92
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,981
Why did you think your friends
were trying to get you a prostitute, Jake?

93
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:54,083
You trying to lose your virginity?

94
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:56,818
Uh, actually...

95
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:59,888
You were supposed to be
my going-away present.

96
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:02,491
I'm going to the Naval Academy tomorrow.

97
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:04,035
- You are?
- Yeah.

98
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:07,095
It's a fairly rigorous selection process.

99
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:09,641
Yeah, I know that. I've heard.

100
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:14,169
Well, if you're interested, maybe
we could get together. I'll give you a tour.

101
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:16,237
You know, I would love that.

102
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:19,216
I'm... kinda feeling a connection here.

103
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:22,277
- You are?
- Yeah.

104
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:25,222
I mean, with me
so close to going to war, and...

105
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,452
You're going to the academy.

106
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:30,723
Well, yeah.
I think we should ask ourselves:

107
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:35,426
Can we afford to pass up
what is possibly our one night together?

108
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:39,096
<i>- (man)</i> I'm gonna do something about it.
<i>- (man #2)</i> Is that right?

109
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:42,499
- I... Just think about that.
<i>- (man)</i> AJ, chill.

110
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:45,976
All right, all right, all right. AJ. AJ!

111
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:48,479
What? I'm just saying hi
to your new friends.

112
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:51,778
OK. All right.

113
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,327
You all set?

114
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:16,373
You sure this is what you want to do?
You're close to getting your hours.

115
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:19,343
I don't want to join the union, Dad.

116
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:22,176
Well, tell me.
What the hell is it you do want?

117
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:26,345
I mean, come on, Jake.
Who we kidding?

118
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:32,380
You don't listen to me or anybody here,
and you're gonna take orders from them?

119
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:36,019
I'm sorry
I didn't give you two weeks' notice.

120
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:38,859
Jake, Jake.

121
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,363
I'll give you a ride.

122
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,246
I'll see you at Christmas.

123
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:20,232
- Go get 'em, son.
- I love you, Mom.

124
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:24,139
All right, smile, now.

00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:49,352
How about your beard?
Plebes are supposed to be clean-shaven.

156
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:52,686
Sir, I shaved this morning, sir.
I just have a thick beard, sir.

157
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:58,287
I want you to shower and shave
every three hours after lights out.

158
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:02,391
And no more cologne.
Do you understand, Estrada?

159
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:05,096
Sir, yes, sir!

160
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:08,437
At ease.

161
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:13,774
Attention on deck.

162
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:17,213
Midshipman Lieutenant Cole.

163
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,787
Get in.

164
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:04,393
Sir, aye aye, sir.

165
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:16,670
- Zip it up.
- Sir, aye aye, sir.

166
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:36,727
I want you all to remember
what that bag looks like with a body in it,

167
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:42,756
'cause if you become officers, this is where
they're gonna put your mistakes.

168
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:47,995
- Do you understand me?
- Sir, yes, sir.

169
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:54,345
All of you came straight here
from high school.

170
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:58,305
But not me.

171
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:05,247
Before I got here,
I served three years in the Marines.

172
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:09,686
Which means I'm more than
just a senior at this academy.

173
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:14,199
I am someone who knows
exactly what it takes to become an officer.

174
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:20,098
And I will accept nothing less from you.

175
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:25,833
If that's not what you signed up for,

176
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:31,015
there's nothing wrong with that.
Just let me know now.

177
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,244
Just raise your hand.

178
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:42,157
All right.

179
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:46,487
Let's go for a little jog.

Yo, move it, move it.

You letting this girl beat you, Nance?
Move it, go.

192

Let's go, let's go, let's go.

<i>- (man)</i> Come on, Loo, move those feet.

Move those feet!
Run it out, Huard, run it out.

197
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:50,120
- Good job, Loo. You too, Huard.
<i>- (man)</i> Let's go, Estrada.

200
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:59,736
Run. Keep doing it.
Come on, just a little further.

201

- Let's go, Echo Company.
<i>- (man)</i> Run it out, guys, run it out.

That's right, come on.
You're almost there.

203
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:09,245
Let's go now.
All right, a little bit more.

204
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,544
Good job.

205
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:31,163
- What's the problem here?
- Sir, I'm trying, sir.

206
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:34,865
- Stop trying and do it.
- Aye aye, sir.

207
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,841
Come on, you butterball, move it.
Move it.

208
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:42,813
There's a big juicy steak
waiting for you, and yams.

209
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:48,646
Holy shit! You are pathetic.

210
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,157
You're the only one
who can't make it up this thing.

211
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:56,217
From now on,
I'm gonna start calling you Twins.

212
00:19:57,095 --> 00:19:59,427
You know why, Twins?

213
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:04,031
Because I'm carrying the weight
of two human beings, sir.

214
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:06,935
You're smart, too.
So you should be able to figure out

215
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:10,634
that if you don't get your fat ass
up this climb by the end of this year,

216
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:14,338
your fat ass is gonna be separated.

217
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:42,099
What the hell are you doing?

218
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:45,905
Just reminding myself
of what I'm fighting for.

219
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:49,712
Hey, Huard.

220
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:54,047
Don't worry. That book's
gonna be all in your head soon.

221
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:56,246
Yeah, I hope.

222
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:58,915
You should learn to make your bed first.

223
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:02,055
What?

224
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:04,891
Fold's gotta be 12 inches from the top.

225

Loo.

Nance.

Oh, this is from that chick

Mike Tyson once said,
"Everybody's got a plan until they get hit."

253
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:08,886
You can say what you want about Tyson,

254
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:12,754
but that's the smartest goddamn thing
I ever heard anybody say about boxing.

255
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:16,089
Centre that weight.
You got no balance, I'd push you right over.

Aye aye, sir.

That is why we teach boxing here.

want to see how you react

when you get popped in that mouth.

260
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:31,340
They want to see how you hold up

261
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:34,937
when your little plan goes to hell.

262

Get that chin down.

Pretty good, Huard. You boxed before?

265

- A little bit.
- Yeah, you can tell.

266

Jab's good, straight right's pretty crisp.

Yeah. You hook like a girl, though.

- Ah, jeez...

- Nice try, Estrada.

- Look, I made the time.

I hadn't even decided to come when I
found out they were throwing me a parade.

There've only been two times in my life
my father ever told me he was proud of me.

294
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:30,378
Fourth grade, I knocked out this bully

00:27:22,607 --> 00:27:24,939
- I don't need your help, Loo.
- Yeah, you do.

309
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:27,069
Hey, I know we're four guys in a shower,

310
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:30,012
but can we keep
the testosterone to a minimum?

311
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:33,710
Hey, Jake.
Help is like sex.

312
00:27:33,785 --> 00:27:36,447
Take it from whoever
and whenever you can get it.

313
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,250
<i>(Ali)</i> Nance, how's the cow?

314
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,851
Ma'am, she walks, she talks,
she's full of chalk.

315
00:27:43,928 --> 00:27:49,161
The lactic fluid extracted from the female of
the bovine species is highly prolific to the...

316
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:51,600
fifth degree, ma'am.

317
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:55,902
- Good job, Nance. Serve yourself.
- Ma'am, thank you, ma'am.

318
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:00,872
I'll give you an easy one, rivet.

319
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:06,512
The Triton Light
has water from how many different seas?

320
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:10,145
- Sir, eight, sir.
- Are you sure?

321
00:28:10,955 --> 00:28:13,355
'Cause you look
like you're guessing, Huard.

322
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:15,393
Sir, I'm sure, sir.

323
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:18,285
So you wouldn't have a problem

324
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,957
betting your companymates' dinner
on your answer?

325
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:23,159
Sir, no, sir.

326
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:25,566
What about their lives?

327
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,803
You said you were sure about the answer.

328
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:36,243
Well, if you're sure,
stakes shouldn't matter.

329
00:28:36,681 --> 00:28:40,811
Loo. The Triton Light
has water from how many different seas?

330
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:43,820
Sir, seven, sir.

331
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:47,380
You just killed
everyone in your company, Huard.

332
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:53,023
Everyone scrape your plates
back onto the platter.

333
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:57,358
The worst officer is someone who guesses.

334
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:03,807
Someone who's too afraid to admit
that they don't know the right answer.

335
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:07,302
Those are the officers
who get people killed.

336
00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:12,107
You bet everyone's meal, Huard.

337
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,919
Enjoy.

338
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:29,729
<i>(beeping)</i>

339
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:50,717
Sir, the uniform for noon meal formation
is Working Blues. Stripers carry swords.

340
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:53,883
The menu for the noon meal
is baked chicken, roast beef,

341
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:56,893
mashed potatoes, vegetables,
cannonballs and hard sauce.

342
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:59,361
You now have ten minutes, sir.

343
00:30:06,004 --> 00:30:08,404
You don't stink so bad, Estrada.

344
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:10,805
- You been taking your showers?
- Sir, yes, sir!

345
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:15,903
All right, Estrada.
You can terminate Operation Disinfect.

346
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,847
Sir, aye aye, sir!

347
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:22,413
Carry on.

348
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:26,685
Finally, a goddamn night of sleep. Oorah!

349
00:30:33,464 --> 00:30:36,365
Estrada, we need to talk.

350
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:41,130
- You mean talk, or talk talk?
- You lied to Whitaker.

351
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:46,701
- What the hell are you talking about?
- You didn't take a shower last night.

352
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,941
So what?

353
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:57,454
Look, man, I been taking those goddamn
showers every night for the past six weeks.

354
00:30:57,522 --> 00:31:00,616
- So what if I missed one?
- You gotta turn yourself in.

355
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,660
Why?

356
00:31:02,727 --> 00:31:05,457
'Cause Whitaker's a racist prick?

357
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:08,158
No, man.
I shouldn't have had to take those showers.

358
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:10,895
It's not the showers.
It's the first thing we learnt.

359
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:14,700
- Midshipmen are persons of integrity.
- Get off your soapbox, Loo!

360
00:31:14,772 --> 00:31:16,967
Loo, it's a shower.
We can take care of this.

361
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:19,339
- You think I want to do this?
- Eat me, poster boy.

362
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:22,243
<i>- (Loo)</i> Just tell the truth.
- Attention on deck!

363
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:38,759
- Is this room ready for inspection?
- Sir, yes, sir!

364
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:41,560
Sir, I need to speak to you, sir.

365
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:43,624
Loo.

366
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:47,568
Sir, I need to speak to you, sir.

367
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:49,402
You mother...

368
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:51,237
<i>(Huard)</i> Hey, hey, hey, hey.

369
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:53,539
<i>(Nance)</i> Hey, hey, hey! Loo. Loo.

370
00:31:53,611 --> 00:31:55,738
Estrada, outside. Now.

371
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:13,394
- Come on, Huard.
- Let's go, Risa. You can do this.

372
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,164
We're gonna drown because of you, Risa.

373
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:23,472
You're crying?
Your ship is sinking and you're crying?

374
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:27,307
You're the reason
they say women don't belong here, Risa.

375
00:32:27,378 --> 00:32:30,905
It's girls like you who give us a bad name.

376
00:32:34,485 --> 00:32:36,885
- She gets the point, ma'am.
- What was that?

377
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:40,618
Ma'am, I said
I think she gets the point, ma'am.

378
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:48,226
Risa, out of the tank.

379
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:56,132
You got a problem with the way
this company's being run, Huard?

380
00:32:56,207 --> 00:32:57,765
Sir, no, sir.

381
00:32:57,842 --> 00:33:03,542
You've got enough problems of your own
without worrying about Risa's.

382
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:08,179
You want to hit me, Huard?

383
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:13,089
- Go ahead.
- Cole, this is my drill. I'll handle it.

384
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:40,884
All right, gentlemen. That's enough.

385
00:33:40,952 --> 00:33:44,718
Nice work, there, Cole.
Nice work. I like that.

386
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:49,322
So you all think you're Rocky Marciano

387
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:53,524
'cause you can tag your roommate
with a weak-ass right.

388
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:56,158
So I had your commanding officer
come in here today

389
00:33:56,234 --> 00:33:59,203
to show you what real boxing is about,

390
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:02,569
'cause if you make Brigades
next semester,

391
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,131
that right there
is what you'll be looking at.

392
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:07,905
Midshipman Cole
looks like he can go another round.

393
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:10,709
- What do you say, Midshipman?
- Let's do it.

394
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:12,807
Uh-oh.

395
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:15,751
Anybody want to come in here with him?

396
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:18,118
Huh?

397
00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:22,148
I hope you're this quiet
when you're sneaking up on the enemy.

398
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:24,251
Loo.

399
00:34:24,328 --> 00:34:27,627
Loo. How about you?

400
00:34:27,698 --> 00:34:32,533
You and your mouth were Golden Gloves
champ at 185 in San Diego.

401
00:34:32,603 --> 00:34:34,628
Come on, champ.

402
00:34:34,705 --> 00:34:40,075
Sir, I would, sir, but I don't want
to give away my secrets until the Brigades.

403
00:34:40,144 --> 00:34:42,203
Pussy.

404
00:34:43,181 --> 00:34:45,240
Come on.

405
00:34:45,316 --> 00:34:48,843
This man has been making your life
miserable for the last two months.

406
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:54,415
It's your chance for a little payback.
Anybody gonna come in here with him?

407
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:56,221
I'll do it.

408
00:34:57,462 --> 00:35:01,626
- You're not in his weight class, Huard.
- I'll wear an extra T-shirt.

409
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:05,802
You're not in his class class, either.

410
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:19,481
- Come on, son.
<i>- (plebes)</i> All right, yeah!

411
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:22,849
All right, Jake. You can do it.
You can do it, Jake.

412
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:32,925
- Sure you want to do this, Huard?
- Yes, sir.

413
00:35:32,997 --> 00:35:35,591
All right, gentlemen. Let's box.

414
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:47,072
All right, all right. It's a slip.

415
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:50,114
It's OK. It's OK, Jake.
It's OK, Jake.

416
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:56,676
Let's box.

417
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:13,633
This ain't one of them smokers
from the shipyard, Huard.

418
00:36:13,704 --> 00:36:16,571
All right. You all right, son?
Let's go.

419
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:19,303
Come on, man.
Stay in there. Stay in there, Jake.

420
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:31,847
All right, all right, that's it.
That's it. That's it.

421
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:34,987
Hope you didn't bet
anybody's meal on this.

422
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:37,619
All right, that's it.
Get his gloves off.

423
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:41,290
Boy's got heart, which is more
than I can say for all of y'all. But heart...

424
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:43,356
What the hell are you doing?

425
00:36:43,434 --> 00:36:45,459
- Let him go.
- Show some discipline.

426
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:47,197
- Let him go.
- Get out of the ring.

427
00:36:47,271 --> 00:36:51,173
Set an example for these plebes.
Settle down. Now!

428
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:57,739
<i>(Burton)</i> Get your gear off.

429
00:36:57,815 --> 00:37:00,147
<i>(Cole)</i> All right.

430
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:10,281
147 to go.

431
00:38:13,991 --> 00:38:16,858
- When are you taking off?
- I'm not.

432
00:38:17,928 --> 00:38:20,726
I gotta stay
and work on my time for the O-course.

433
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:25,030
And, to be honest, I'm afraid
if I walk out of here, I won't come back.

434
00:38:25,936 --> 00:38:30,703
So, you have a good Christmas.
I'll see you after leave.

435
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:33,836
Hey, Huard?

436
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:37,011
I said, I'll see you after leave.

437
00:38:38,282 --> 00:38:40,682
Sir, yes, sir.

438
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:07,341
Hey, how are you?

439
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:24,424
Hey, it's Popeye the Sailor Man.

440
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:30,030
Easy, easy, easy...

441
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:33,296
<i>- (all)</i> Cheers!
- To Jake.

442
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:36,932
- It's great to have you back.
- That's right.

443
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:41,812
You say they kicked some guy out
for not taking a shower?

444
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:45,246
Yeah. Yeah, they threw a couple out
for hooking up with girls, too.

445
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:49,252
That sounds like bullshit to me, man.
I don't know why you put up with that crap.

446
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,687
Well, it's not a job. It's an adventure.

447
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:54,418
I'll drink to that.

448
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:00,394
I'll drink to that.

449
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,862
I'll drink to you drinking to that.

450
00:40:13,711 --> 00:40:14,871
Hey.

451
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,946
The fight's about to start. You hungry?

452
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:24,510
- No, thanks.
- You sure?

453
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:30,456
So AJ said you guys
are a couple weeks behind.

454
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:35,192
- Yeah, a little.
- I was wondering if you could use me.

455
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:38,133
Well, I don't have any short time stuff.

456
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:44,039
Yeah, well, I wasn't really
thinking about short time stuff.

457
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:47,738
Are you sure this is what you want?

458
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:53,375
OK.

459
00:41:01,525 --> 00:41:06,053
I'll talk to Mike tomorrow.
See what we can work out.

460
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,620
Thanks.

461
00:41:07,698 --> 00:41:10,030
Should be a good fight.

462
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:28,243
So I told Mike you would meet him
over at Sir Frankie's at five.

463
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:32,187
Ah, that's all right.
I think I'm just gonna go home.

464
00:41:32,256 --> 00:41:34,247
What?

465
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:37,692
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. I'm just tired.

466
00:41:52,743 --> 00:41:54,938
So how much did you collect?

467
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:57,310
It's just for shits and giggles, man.

468
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:59,941
How much?

469
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:02,986
A little over 500.

470
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:12,392
What's up?
AJ leave early or something?

471
00:42:17,635 --> 00:42:19,967
You all right?

472
00:42:21,772 --> 00:42:25,503
What kind of father
wants his own son to fail?

473
00:42:25,576 --> 00:42:28,170
- What are you talking about?
- You gave me my job back.

474
00:42:28,245 --> 00:42:30,839
- You asked for it back.
- And you said yes.

475
00:42:30,915 --> 00:42:34,043
- This is a good thing here.
- Yeah, not for me.

476
00:42:34,118 --> 00:42:37,884
You knew how bad I wanted to go
to the academy. You never said anything.

477
00:42:37,955 --> 00:42:43,120
Why? Would it kill you
that I might actually do better than you?

478
00:42:43,193 --> 00:42:48,096
You want the truth? I didn't want you to go
over there because I knew this'd happen.

479
00:42:48,165 --> 00:42:52,795
You'd be back here,
pissed off 'cause you didn't make it.

480
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:59,034
Look, Jake, I know you promised
your mother that you'd go to the academy.

481
00:42:59,109 --> 00:43:01,942
And you tried, but it just didn't work out.

482
00:43:02,012 --> 00:43:07,109
Yeah. Maybe it would have
if she was the one who was still around.

483
00:43:10,054 --> 00:43:13,717
Look, I know I haven't been the best father.

484
00:43:14,558 --> 00:43:19,188
And you can blame me for a lot of things,
but this ain't one of them,

485
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:24,997
'cause when it's all said and done,
I didn't quit. You did, Jake.

I thought you were gonna dance with me.

I'm sorry. Do you mind if I cut in?

00:45:13,677 --> 00:45:16,510
This is nice.

503
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:19,879
I don't think I've danced since high school.

504
00:45:20,584 --> 00:45:23,951
- No spring dances at the academy?
- No.

505
00:45:24,021 --> 00:45:26,353
Uh-uh. Never gone.

506
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:29,221
Yeah, you can tell.

507
00:45:29,293 --> 00:45:31,761
Really? Says the guy
who keep stepping on my foot.

508
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:33,820
Ow!

509
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:36,365
Sorry.

510
00:45:39,303 --> 00:45:41,601
Why don't you go to the dances?

511
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:48,239
Some guys at the academy
don't view women as their equals.

512
00:45:48,312 --> 00:45:51,213
It's worse if you start dating them.

513
00:45:54,151 --> 00:45:56,813
It's no fun being underestimated, is it?

514
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:03,715
It's worse when you do it to yourself.

515
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:14,260
Excuse me.

516
00:46:16,306 --> 00:46:19,537
I will see you tomorrow, Plebe Huard.

517
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:23,276
Watch your feet.

518
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:43,194
- Delta Company.
- Sir.

519
00:46:43,267 --> 00:46:48,762
One missing and unaccounted for.
Midshipman Fourth Class Butcher.

520
00:46:54,278 --> 00:46:57,736
- Echo Company.
- Sir, two missing and unaccounted for.

521
00:46:57,815 --> 00:47:00,079
Midshipman Fourth Class Casarico,

522
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:02,141
Midshipman Fourth Class Huard.

523
00:47:07,124 --> 00:47:12,619
Ma'am, Midshipman Fourth Class Huard
is present and accounted for, ma'am.

524
00:47:22,472 --> 00:47:26,806
- In case you forgot, we wear uniform here.
- Sir, yes, sir.

525
00:47:26,877 --> 00:47:30,438
- Put yourself on report.
- Sir, aye aye, sir.

526
00:47:38,956 --> 00:47:43,086
- Memorial Hall in ten, Huard.
- Sir, aye aye, sir.

527
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:02,435
Dead at 23.

528
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:06,549
The best officer I ever served under.

529
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:10,584
I'm sorry about your friend, sir.

530
00:48:10,654 --> 00:48:13,623
Why? He's not.

531
00:48:17,327 --> 00:48:19,921
Why are you here, Huard?

532
00:48:20,697 --> 00:48:22,790
To serve my country, sir.

533
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,732
You say that here...

534
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:30,729
where people actually died
for their country.

535
00:48:31,675 --> 00:48:34,269
You don't think I took Psych 101?

536
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:38,245
You're here to answer the question
that's gnawed at you

537
00:48:38,315 --> 00:48:42,945
ever since you saw this place
from across the river.

538
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:45,818
Well, let me spare you the suspense.

539
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:48,691
You ain't good enough.

540
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:51,159
I've heard that my whole life.

541
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:54,659
But I'm still here.

542
00:48:56,266 --> 00:49:01,499
All the other company commanders here,
they're playing soldier.

543
00:49:02,506 --> 00:49:04,633
But I've been a soldier, Huard.

544
00:49:05,909 --> 00:49:08,969
I've seen what good officers are like.

545
00:49:11,014 --> 00:49:13,983
And I know what bad officers are like.

546
00:49:15,485 --> 00:49:20,445
So there ain't no way
I'm letting someone finish this year

547
00:49:20,524 --> 00:49:23,721
who's not worthy of this academy.

548
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:26,661
I'm not quitting.

How many missiles are the Ohio class

551
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:42,911

capable of carrying?

Sir, I'll find out, sir.

Who was the youngest midshipman,
and how old was he?

Sir, I'll find out, sir.

You can join Huard
on marching tours this weekend.

560
00:50:23,086 --> 00:50:24,644
Carry on.

561
00:50:24,721 --> 00:50:27,019
Understand this.

562
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:32,255
When Plebe Huard
doesn't know his rates, none of you do.

563
00:50:33,263 --> 00:50:36,824
A company is only as strong
as its weakest plebe.

564
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:53,709
You should get out too, Nance.
He's just gonna drag you down.

565
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:57,050
He's right, you know.

566
00:50:59,289 --> 00:51:01,621
Can I borrow your starch?

567
00:51:02,659 --> 00:51:05,753
Look, I don't get it.
Why are you still here?

568
00:51:06,663 --> 00:51:10,963
- You want to know why I stay in this room?
- Yeah.

569
00:51:11,034 --> 00:51:14,197
'Cause, Jake, you're my Mississippi.

570
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:17,032
I'm your what?

571
00:51:17,107 --> 00:51:21,009
People who live in Arkansas,
you know what their favorite state is?

572
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:22,204
No.

573
00:51:22,279 --> 00:51:26,579
Mississippi. 'Cause Mississippi's
the only thing that keeps Arkansas

574
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:30,177
from being the worst state
in the whole country.

575
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:35,088
- I'm Mississippi.
- Well, you sure as hell ain't California.

576
00:51:35,158 --> 00:51:38,093
Listen, Cole and Whitaker
are so busy trying to run you out

577
00:51:38,161 --> 00:51:40,629
they forgot all about me.

578
00:51:40,697 --> 00:51:47,728
As a matter of fact, they've forgotten about
every other plebe in this whole company.

579
00:51:47,804 --> 00:51:52,571
That's why I stay in this room, Jake.
'Cause if Mississippi quits,

580
00:51:52,642 --> 00:51:57,739
then all of a sudden Arkansas
is the worst state in the whole country.

581
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:01,448
Hey, where's my starch?

582
00:52:01,518 --> 00:52:04,146
- All right.
- Come on, chop chop.

583
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:16,526
You're looking good, Huard.

584
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:20,229
Pretty soon you'll be able
to keep up with my six-year-old daughter.

585
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:23,033
When can I start boxing again, sir?

586
00:52:23,106 --> 00:52:25,904
When I make admiral.

587
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:31,073
You knew better than to pull
that mess you pulled in my ring, son.

588
00:52:39,022 --> 00:52:41,115
Eyes on the ring.

589
00:52:41,191 --> 00:52:44,217
Brigades Tournament
begins in eight weeks.

590
00:52:44,294 --> 00:52:46,854
Training starts this Friday.

591
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:52,334
Brigades is the biggest event
in this academy all year. You know why?

592
00:52:52,402 --> 00:52:58,068
Because the boxing ring is the only place
in this academy where everybody's equal.

593
00:52:58,141 --> 00:53:01,804
Doesn't matter what your rank is,
how many stripes you got,

594
00:53:01,878 --> 00:53:07,180
the only thing that is guaranteed
when you step inside these ropes:

595
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:11,548
You're gonna find out who you are.

596
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:26,631
This doesn't look like your room.

597
00:53:28,171 --> 00:53:31,265
What are you doing here, Huard?

598
00:53:31,341 --> 00:53:33,502
I'm training for the Brigades, sir.

599
00:53:35,845 --> 00:53:38,279
All right, Huard.

600
00:53:38,348 --> 00:53:40,339
Let's see how you're doing.

601
00:53:41,117 --> 00:53:43,347
Sir?

602
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:45,911
Show me how
you're gonna win the Brigades.

603
00:53:47,991 --> 00:53:50,323
<i>(Burton)</i> Ding ding.

604
00:53:51,528 --> 00:53:55,259
Don't worry, Huard.
I'm not your company officer in here.

605
00:53:55,332 --> 00:53:58,460
I'm just a guy
looking to punch you in the mouth.

606
00:53:58,535 --> 00:54:03,802
Well, you can take a punch.
I guess we knew that already, didn't we?

607
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:08,973
You can actually land a punch, too.

608
00:54:14,217 --> 00:54:16,344
- You're pretty good, Huard.
- Thanks.

609
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:19,411
Against a 36-year-old
out-of-shape lieutenant.

610
00:54:32,035 --> 00:54:34,526
Not bad, Huard.

611
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:39,405
You know, most of the boxers in the
Brigades are nationally ranked amateurs.

612
00:54:39,476 --> 00:54:42,809
Think you're gonna beat 'em
by hitting the bag for a couple hours?

613
00:54:42,879 --> 00:54:44,870
I'll do what I have to.

614
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:48,111
Really? Without anyone training you?

615
00:54:48,184 --> 00:54:52,883
You think you're gonna be the first plebe
to get through here without anyone's help?

616
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:55,356
I don't need anyone's help.

617
00:55:06,002 --> 00:55:08,698
No one thinks I'll make it anyway.

618
00:55:15,512 --> 00:55:20,245
Who do you think convinced the board
to take a chance on you?

619
00:55:24,954 --> 00:55:31,518
This ain't the shipyard, Huard. You can't
just will yourself through this place.

620
00:55:55,085 --> 00:55:56,882
Sorry. I'll be done in a minute.

621
00:56:04,928 --> 00:56:11,265
Here. Recent studies show that auditory
retention surpasses that of visual retention.

622
00:56:13,336 --> 00:56:14,360
OK.

623
00:56:14,437 --> 00:56:17,998
OK. Turn off the light
so I can get some sleep.

624
00:56:23,446 --> 00:56:25,937
<i>(Nance's voice)</i>
<i>What is the latitude of Annapolis?</i>

625
00:56:26,015 --> 00:56:29,246
<i>The latitude of Annapolis is 38.58° north.</i>

626
00:56:29,319 --> 00:56:30,411
Thanks.

627
00:56:37,293 --> 00:56:39,625
- Ma'am.
- Plebe Huard.

628
00:56:41,831 --> 00:56:44,322
- Everything OK?
- Yes, ma'am.

629
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:48,067
You know I'm training for the Brigades.

630
00:56:48,138 --> 00:56:51,403
That's great, Huard. Good luck.

631
00:56:51,474 --> 00:56:53,704
Maybe we could work out together.

632
00:56:53,777 --> 00:56:56,940
Uh, no. I think I'm already
in pretty good shape, thanks.

633
00:56:57,013 --> 00:56:59,345
Ma'am.

634
00:57:02,485 --> 00:57:05,181
I need your help.

635
00:57:28,878 --> 00:57:32,177
What? Think you're gonna be
all alone in that ring?

636
00:57:36,085 --> 00:57:38,246
Come on. Come on.

637
00:57:38,321 --> 00:57:40,755
- Let's go.
- Come on.

638
00:57:56,973 --> 00:57:59,373
- Damn it.
- Come on.

639
00:58:00,109 --> 00:58:03,306
Before you achieve, you must believe.

640
00:58:03,379 --> 00:58:05,438
Let's go, Arkansas.

641
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:23,155
Come on, Huard.
I've seen better footwork at Payless.

642
00:58:23,233 --> 00:58:24,700
Come on, get back in there.

643
00:58:24,767 --> 00:58:28,066
Better footwork at Payless?

644
00:58:48,725 --> 00:58:51,523
- Jake.
- What?

645
00:58:53,429 --> 00:58:57,763
You're trying to get into
Cole's weight class, right?

646
00:58:59,802 --> 00:59:01,667
Yeah.

647
00:59:05,341 --> 00:59:06,672
What's this?

648
00:59:06,743 --> 00:59:10,839
Well, you're not gonna get there
by just eating the stuff they serve you here.

649
00:59:10,914 --> 00:59:15,874
What you need, my friend, is the patented
Marcus Nance North Beach Diet,

650
00:59:15,952 --> 00:59:18,819
which, I'm proud to say,

651
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:25,384
has been perfected
after 18 years of dedicated research.

652
00:59:26,696 --> 00:59:29,790
- So you're gonna get me to 185?
- Hey.

653
00:59:29,866 --> 00:59:33,768
I'm not only the president
of the Marcus Nance North Beach Diet,

654
00:59:33,836 --> 00:59:36,236
I'm also a client.

655
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:06,825
Come on, get down in the mud.
Come on. Come on, buddy.

656
01:00:06,903 --> 01:00:09,804
Up, up. Over, over.
Go, Arkansas. Come on.

657
01:00:09,872 --> 01:00:10,964
Let me see you run.

658
01:00:14,978 --> 01:00:17,776
<i>(Nance) How long have you been</i>
<i>in the Navy? All my bloomin' life.</i>

659
01:00:21,718 --> 01:00:25,586
Just hook it over and we're done.
Hook it over and we're done. Here we go.

660
01:00:38,267 --> 01:00:40,292
What happened to all my ball machines?

661
01:00:43,072 --> 01:00:46,599
- Come on, Huard. Dance for me.
- Hit me once and you can talk like that.

662
01:00:46,676 --> 01:00:50,168
- I have. I think I hit you about five times.
- Ooh!

663
01:00:50,246 --> 01:00:52,578
Make that six, Huard.

664
01:01:01,391 --> 01:01:04,292
Three. That's three. Gimme one more.

665
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:07,329
That was for momma.
Gimme one for daddy. Get up there.

666
01:01:07,397 --> 01:01:10,059
How bad do you want it?
How bad do you want it?

667
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:25,511
Not quite there, huh?

668
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:30,209
Come on. How bad do you want it?

669
01:02:05,922 --> 01:02:08,254
OK, that's good. Stop.

670
01:02:23,906 --> 01:02:26,033
I never could have done it.

671
01:02:28,244 --> 01:02:30,269
What?

672
01:02:30,346 --> 01:02:34,976
Made it through plebe year
if I could see my home every day.

673
01:02:36,619 --> 01:02:42,649
Well, if I couldn't see it every day,
I probably would have quit a long time ago.

674
01:02:47,697 --> 01:02:51,428
You know, my mom
used to take me out here.

675
01:02:51,501 --> 01:02:53,526
We had a Sunfish.

676
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:55,935
We'd park it down there.

677
01:03:00,743 --> 01:03:05,373
She was the only person
who ever believed I'd make it here.

678
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:08,144
She must be very proud of you.

679
01:03:09,485 --> 01:03:11,817
She would be.

680
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:15,989
I'm sorry.

681
01:03:18,528 --> 01:03:21,326
She's what's getting you through?

682
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:27,197
Well... She's what got me here.

683
01:03:29,272 --> 01:03:33,038
But she's not the one
who's getting me through.

684
01:03:46,689 --> 01:03:48,748
Matt Cole, 197.

685
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:51,726
All right, Midshipman. You step down.

686
01:03:53,196 --> 01:03:55,289
Anybody else for heavyweight?

687
01:03:57,600 --> 01:04:03,095
- All right, I guess that's it, then.
<i>- (Nance)</i> One more heavyweight.

688
01:04:09,478 --> 01:04:12,038
- Huard, what are you doing?
- Weighing in.

689
01:04:12,114 --> 01:04:15,515
Jump rope contest is next week.
My daughter's looking forward to it.

690
01:04:15,585 --> 01:04:17,678
- Anybody else?
- Sir.

691
01:04:17,753 --> 01:04:21,018
You said the Brigades
were open to all midshipmen.

692
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:23,183
I want to fight.

693
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:35,535
Fine. I'm gonna draw up a permission slip
for your parents to sign. Hit the scales.

694
01:04:55,424 --> 01:04:57,756
Jake Huard, 185.

695
01:06:14,537 --> 01:06:16,300
Next up, heavyweight division:

696
01:06:16,372 --> 01:06:19,136
Midshipman Loo
versus Midshipman Huard.

697
01:06:19,208 --> 01:06:22,302
- Let's go.
<i>- (crowd chants)</i> Loo! Loo! Loo! Loo!

698
01:06:22,378 --> 01:06:24,710
<i>(chanting continues)</i>

699
01:06:29,385 --> 01:06:32,582
You both received your instructions
in the dressing rooms.

700
01:06:32,655 --> 01:06:35,089
I want you to keep it clean.
Any questions?

701
01:06:35,157 --> 01:06:37,489
Payback's a bitch, Huard.

702
01:06:42,198 --> 01:06:45,258
You set the pace out there, Huard.

703
01:06:45,334 --> 01:06:46,858
<i>(bell)</i>

704
01:07:09,191 --> 01:07:11,284
Come on, Jake. One more.

705
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:13,260
Hmm? Come on, hit me one time.

706
01:07:16,899 --> 01:07:19,891
One, two, three,

707
01:07:19,969 --> 01:07:23,905
four, five, six, seven,

708
01:07:23,973 --> 01:07:26,441
eight, nine, ten.

709
01:07:26,509 --> 01:07:27,840
You're out.

710
01:07:33,082 --> 01:07:34,777
What is the latitude of Annapolis?

711
01:07:34,850 --> 01:07:38,718
- Who were the first three admirals?
- How long have you been in the Navy?

712
01:07:38,788 --> 01:07:43,157
Sir, the latitude of Annapolis
is 38.58° north.

713
01:07:43,225 --> 01:07:46,752
Sir, the first three admirals
were Dewey, Porter and Farragut.

714
01:07:46,829 --> 01:07:49,559
Sir, I've been in the Navy
all my bloomin' life, sir.

715
01:07:49,632 --> 01:07:52,066
My mother's a mermaid,
my father's King Neptune.

716
01:07:52,134 --> 01:07:56,298
Every bone in my body is a spar.
And when I spits, I spits tar.

717
01:07:56,372 --> 01:07:58,966
I's hard, I is, I am, I are.

718
01:08:01,010 --> 01:08:04,605
All right. Everybody on your feet.

719
01:08:07,216 --> 01:08:09,411
Everyone but Huard is dismissed.

720
01:08:14,790 --> 01:08:17,224
How about some more up-downs, Huard?

721
01:08:50,025 --> 01:08:54,758
What? I'm a plebe. I love rolling
on the ground and freezing my ass off.

722
01:08:59,101 --> 01:09:02,127
Y'all trying to make me proud
out here tonight, huh?

723
01:09:02,738 --> 01:09:05,070
- Oorah!
<i>- (plebes)</i> Oorah!

724
01:09:05,207 --> 01:09:07,675
- Oorah!
<i>- (plebes)</i> Oorah!

725
01:09:13,849 --> 01:09:16,613
Good. Time.

726
01:09:16,685 --> 01:09:19,381
- Nicely done, Huard.
- Thank you.

727
01:09:20,789 --> 01:09:25,954
Good job. Your left hook's getting there.

728
01:09:27,296 --> 01:09:29,526
- It's getting there?
- Mm-hm.

729
01:09:29,598 --> 01:09:31,930
- But it's not there yet?
- Not yet.

730
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:33,992
- Really?
- Almost.

731
01:09:35,037 --> 01:09:38,097
- Why don't you show me? There.
- OK.

732
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:40,165
- Not bad.
- All right.

733
01:09:40,242 --> 01:09:43,405
- Show me how to...
- It's just... the little things.

734
01:09:43,479 --> 01:09:47,540
Like, really get your weight behind it.
You know what I mean?

735
01:09:47,616 --> 01:09:51,211
Ooh! I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry.

736
01:09:51,287 --> 01:09:52,618
Oh...

737
01:09:52,688 --> 01:09:56,715
- Jeez.
- Let me see. No, it's OK. I'm sorry.

738
01:09:56,792 --> 01:09:58,555
- Is it bleeding?
- Uh-uh.

739
01:09:58,627 --> 01:10:00,618
- Huh?
- Mm-mm.

740
01:10:06,135 --> 01:10:09,366
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

741
01:10:09,438 --> 01:10:13,169
- I'm OK.
- No, I mean about...

742
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:16,803
About stopping.

743
01:10:17,813 --> 01:10:19,280
Oh.

744
01:10:19,348 --> 01:10:22,943
Well, why are you sorry?
I was the one who stopped.

745
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:25,884
What did you say?

746
01:10:25,955 --> 01:10:28,890
It was getting a little hot.
I had to push you away.

747
01:10:29,391 --> 01:10:35,261
You know what? I think I hit you
over the head a little too hard there, Jake.

748
01:10:45,708 --> 01:10:49,838
One, two, three, four,

749
01:10:49,912 --> 01:10:52,745
five, six, seven,

750
01:10:52,815 --> 01:10:56,046
eight, nine, ten.

751
01:10:56,118 --> 01:10:57,813
You're out!

752
01:11:04,593 --> 01:11:06,060
You OK?

753
01:11:09,898 --> 01:11:12,423
Nice smile, Huard.

754
01:11:12,501 --> 01:11:15,732
Can't wait to see
what Cole does to it in the finals.

755
01:11:15,804 --> 01:11:17,897
Good fight.

756
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:47,132
No way.

757
01:12:19,368 --> 01:12:25,170
It's impressive, to be able to say
you helped build something like this.

758
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:49,888
Take ten.

759
01:12:55,871 --> 01:12:57,736
Hey.

760
01:12:58,307 --> 01:13:00,332
The ship looks great.

761
01:13:00,409 --> 01:13:02,001
Yeah, it might float.

762
01:13:03,712 --> 01:13:07,614
So, I know you're probably busy, but...

763
01:13:07,683 --> 01:13:10,584
I have a fight next week. Saturday.

764
01:13:10,652 --> 01:13:14,850
It's the finals in the Brigades.
It's for the whole academy.

765
01:13:14,923 --> 01:13:17,391
We're still a little behind.

766
01:13:17,459 --> 01:13:19,450
Yeah. I get it.

767
01:13:21,630 --> 01:13:23,860
All right.

768
01:13:23,932 --> 01:13:26,628
I guess I'll see you soon.

769
01:13:28,237 --> 01:13:30,603
Yeah, sure.

770
01:13:30,672 --> 01:13:34,233
- Take care of yourself.
- All right. You too.

771
01:13:43,085 --> 01:13:46,816
The required time for plebes
is five minutes.

772
01:13:46,889 --> 01:13:52,020
Failure to meet that requirement
will result in separation.

773
01:13:52,094 --> 01:13:54,927
There will be no retest.

774
01:13:54,997 --> 01:13:56,988
Good luck.

This is nothing.
You're there. You're there.

Hook it over.

That's it. You got it.

Come on, Twins.
Show Whitaker. Show him. Let's go.

Yeah! That's it.

Sir, give him another chance.
He can make it.

789
01:15:29,825 --> 01:15:32,055
5:04 is 5:04.

790
01:15:32,127 --> 01:15:36,393
It's four seconds.
You know how far he's come?

791
01:16:01,957 --> 01:16:03,948
Hey.

792
01:16:06,895 --> 01:16:10,854
They gave me the key to the city.
You know that?

793
01:16:11,433 --> 01:16:14,129
You think I have to give it back?

794
01:16:14,670 --> 01:16:18,436
Hey, this isn't over.
We can talk to Burton.

795
01:16:20,442 --> 01:16:23,775
Remember how I told you about
that bully I beat up in the fourth grade?

796
01:16:23,845 --> 01:16:25,608
Mm-hm.

797
01:16:27,849 --> 01:16:33,913
Truth is, he tripped when he hit me
and knocked himself out on the pavement.

798
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:37,923
Next day, he kicked the crap outta me
till I cried like a baby...

799
01:16:37,993 --> 01:16:42,828
All right, come on, Arkansas.
You can't do this to yourself.

800
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:48,092
I let 'em down.
I let my parents down...

801
01:16:48,170 --> 01:16:52,038
You didn't let anyone down. We're gonna
work this out. It's gonna be fine...

802
01:16:52,107 --> 01:16:54,268
Just stop it, Jake! OK?

803
01:16:54,343 --> 01:16:56,243
It's over.

804
01:16:58,580 --> 01:17:01,105
I don't belong here, OK?

805
01:17:01,183 --> 01:17:03,515
You belong here.

806
01:17:06,788 --> 01:17:09,723
I just need some time alone, all right?

807
01:17:10,726 --> 01:17:11,784
OK.

808
01:17:12,961 --> 01:17:14,258

Get off, Jake. Get up.

- Cool off. Cool off, Jake, come on.

Take it easy. Just take it easy.
It's not worth it, man.

820
01:18:53,061 --> 01:18:55,757
Cool off, man. You gotta cool off.

821
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:48,012
So you're quitting?

822
01:19:53,588 --> 01:19:56,216
What about your review board?

823
01:19:56,291 --> 01:20:00,921
I hit my superior officer.
We both know how it's gonna end.

824
01:20:03,398 --> 01:20:08,131
I asked for more time
to prepare my statement for the board.

825
01:20:09,404 --> 01:20:13,272
Your appearance
has been moved to Monday.

826
01:20:13,341 --> 01:20:15,775
After the Brigade finals.

827
01:20:19,347 --> 01:20:23,113
I'm giving you
what you wanted all year, Huard.

828
01:20:56,685 --> 01:20:57,879
Hey.

829
01:20:58,053 --> 01:21:00,044
Hey.

830
01:21:03,658 --> 01:21:06,718
Doctor says you're gonna be all right.

Yeah?

There are more important things
than the fight right now.

835
01:21:23,511 --> 01:21:26,105
Listen, Jake. We're both lucky.

836
01:21:28,450 --> 01:21:30,782
We got second chances.

837
01:21:35,190 --> 01:21:37,556
I'm not gonna waste mine.

838
01:21:40,495 --> 01:21:42,827
Neither are you.

839
01:21:46,067 --> 01:21:49,264
When you step in that ring,
you have three rounds

Stay off the ropes, Huard.

Remember,

Look at me, Jake. Look at me.
I want you to watch him, OK?

01:31:16,137 --> 01:31:20,574
He's getting tired, Jake.
You've gotta go for it. Go for it.

923
01:31:20,641 --> 01:31:22,438
<i>(Ali)</i> 20 seconds, Huard.

924
01:31:22,510 --> 01:31:24,808
Come on, Huard. Yeah!

925
01:31:25,746 --> 01:31:28,613
Keep your rhythm. Keep your rhythm.

926
01:31:28,683 --> 01:31:30,310
Get outta the corner.

927

<i>(Loo)</i> Ten seconds, Jake.
You gotta take him out now.

928
01:31:33,821 --> 01:31:35,311
Come on, Huard.

929

Yeah, that kid Huard's a tough kid.

933
01:32:02,984 --> 01:32:05,885
- Go on, Jake!
- That's my boy right there.

934
01:32:05,953 --> 01:32:08,285
That's my boy.

935
01:32:11,492 --> 01:32:14,586
OK. Fighters to the centre.

936
01:32:14,662 --> 01:32:17,495
Fighters to the centre. Let's go.

937
01:32:31,045 --> 01:32:33,741
- Out the way.
- Let me get a shot.

938
01:32:36,551 --> 01:32:38,985
Sorry, man.

939
01:32:41,088 --> 01:32:43,682
I told you. Hell of a fight.

940
01:32:43,758 --> 01:32:47,023
Yeah, number one, baby.
Yeah, number one.

941
01:32:54,802 --> 01:32:57,464
You did great.

<i>(crowd chanting. "Jake! Jake!")</i>

- Good job, man.
- Good job, Jake. Good fight.

945
01:33:45,486 --> 01:33:48,649
<i>(man)</i> Midshipman Huard, please stand.

946
01:33:52,994 --> 01:33:58,626
Mr. Huard, this review board
finds you guilty of insubordination.

947
01:33:58,699 --> 01:34:00,690
Sir, yes, sir.

948
01:34:01,502 --> 01:34:06,997
However, based on the recommendation
of your company commander,

949
01:34:07,074 --> 01:34:10,168
this board has decided to retain you.

950
01:34:10,244 --> 01:34:15,807
Your punishment
will be 95 days' restriction and 95 demerits.

951
01:34:15,883 --> 01:34:19,717
Punishment will commence immediately
upon your return from summer cruise.

952
01:34:19,787 --> 01:34:21,982
Is that understood?

953
01:34:23,357 --> 01:34:25,484
Sir, yes, sir.

954
01:34:37,938 --> 01:34:40,736
Congratulations, Midshipman Huard.

955
01:34:40,808 --> 01:34:43,003
Thank you, sir.

956
01:34:46,047 --> 01:34:48,345
Class of 2008.

957
01:34:49,283 --> 01:34:53,583
Congratulations.
You just completed your plebe year.

958
01:34:54,121 --> 01:34:56,214
<i>(all)</i> Plebes no more!

959
01:34:56,624 --> 01:34:58,956
Your summer leave starts...

960
01:35:01,796 --> 01:35:04,321
- Now!
<i>- (all cheer)</i>

961
01:35:11,739 --> 01:35:13,570
Three more years, man.

962
01:35:25,286 --> 01:35:27,811
I'll see you, man.

963
01:35:29,356 --> 01:35:32,484
- Congratulations, Jake.
- Thank you, ma'am.

964
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:36,087
- Any plans before your summer cruise?
- Uh, yeah.

965
01:35:36,163 --> 01:35:40,429
I think I might go over to Sir Frankie's
and see if there are any escorts around.

966
01:35:40,501 --> 01:35:41,991
- Really?
- Yeah.

967
01:35:42,069 --> 01:35:44,401
Save your money.

968
01:35:49,543 --> 01:35:52,273
- Plebes no more.
- Plebes no more.

969

- I'll see you at Sir Frankie's.
- You got it.

970
01:36:09,263 --> 01:36:10,730
Sir.

971
01:36:14,535 --> 01:36:17,003
I want to thank you.

972
01:36:17,071 --> 01:36:20,905
- For what?
- For helping me with the review board.

973
01:36:21,742 --> 01:36:25,576
It wasn't about you, Huard.
That was about this academy.

974
01:36:28,716 --> 01:36:30,911
Good luck out there.

975
01:36:37,324 --> 01:36:38,518
Sir.

976
01:36:41,028 --> 01:36:45,192
What do you think would have happened
if that fight went another round?

977
01:36:45,266 --> 01:36:48,292
You really want to find out?

978
01:36:48,369 --> 01:36:50,803
Come join me in the Marines.
