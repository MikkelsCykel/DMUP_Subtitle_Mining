1
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,695
And so DeVanzo stands in.

2
00:00:19,766 --> 00:00:21,893
Six foot first baseman
out of Pawtucket.

3
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:23,833
fine form on this fellow.

4
00:00:24,866 --> 00:00:26,333
Shot down the line.

5
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,767
That's a frozen rope.

6
00:00:28,933 --> 00:00:30,491
Base hit in anybody's league.

7
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:38,034
And here's Captain Jeter steps up
to the plate to his usual hip-hop music.

8
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:43,030
And look at the triceps
on this youngster.

9
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,101
Someone was busy in the Nautilus room
during the off-season.

10
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:48,691
He'll give the fans a treat
and do a little flexing.

11
00:00:48,866 --> 00:00:51,164
That's right. There're a couple
of actresses on the front row...

12
00:00:51,233 --> 00:00:53,724
that are going out of their minds
right about now.

13
00:00:55,066 --> 00:00:55,862
Yeah!

14
00:00:55,933 --> 00:00:58,197
And sometimes he'll get in there
and just give the fans a treat...

15
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:02,066
and show them
some of the finer points of hitting.

16
00:01:03,466 --> 00:01:04,398
Fuck!

17
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,027
Absolute pe_ect ten
on this fellow.

18
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,258
Quite a specimen.

19
00:01:08,533 --> 00:01:13,561
385 hitter, 23 ding-dongs.
He's driven in 162 runs.

20
00:01:13,633 --> 00:01:16,329
He's 30 sit-ups away from the body
of a young Willie Mays!

21
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,300
And that's a single
up in the middle.

22
00:01:18,366 --> 00:01:20,891
Looked more like a double
play to me, you fat fuck.

23
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:22,531
What the fuck did you say?

24
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:25,034
I said softball's
for girls and faggots...

25
00:01:25,099 --> 00:01:26,692
and girl faggots like you.

26
00:01:26,766 --> 00:01:27,790
You piece of shit!

27
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:30,232
Mom!

28
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:33,235
the fat fuck ne_ door
is chasing me again!

29
00:01:43,766 --> 00:01:45,290
Anybody had seen my softball hat?

30
00:01:45,733 --> 00:01:46,995
-Michael?
-Yeah.

31
00:01:47,066 --> 00:01:50,160
-Did you look at these cakes, yet?
-Yeah, yeah. I like that one.

32
00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:52,998
Hey, Marie, Marie, get the hat!
Gina, get the hat!

33
00:01:53,066 --> 00:01:54,795
-You didn't even look?
-Marie, that's not funny!

34
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,027
Okay, you know what?
I'm not being a bitch here.

35
00:01:57,133 --> 00:01:58,930
You're missing
Marie's recital tonight...

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,401
and I said we could wait for after the
softball season to go on our honeymoon.

37
00:02:02,466 --> 00:02:05,367
I even let you pick
your scumbag friend Artie as best man.

38
00:02:05,433 --> 00:02:07,560
Sweetheart, listen,
it's the first game of the season.

39
00:02:07,633 --> 00:02:09,066
I just don't want to be late,
alright?

40
00:02:09,133 --> 00:02:11,158
I'm with you on the cake.
So I'll look at them later.

41
00:02:11,566 --> 00:02:13,158
You know,
I was gonna surprise you...

42
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:15,167
by making your little
plastic man on the cake...

43
00:02:15,233 --> 00:02:16,791
a Derek Jeter action figure.

44
00:02:16,933 --> 00:02:18,457
But now, no.

45
00:02:18,533 --> 00:02:21,502
I'm making you one of those
Puerto Ricans from the fucking Mets.

46
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,161
Don't even joke like that, Gina!

47
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:40,358
-I'm coming back tomorrow for tanning.
-You better.

48
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:49,532
Hey! Mark Vicki Galliotta
down as paid up for this month.

49
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:55,495
And another dumb slut
gets herpes.

50
00:03:09,966 --> 00:03:13,834
Hey! I don't want any of you Italians
drinking out of my water bottle!

51
00:03:14,633 --> 00:03:15,657
Damn Wops.

52
00:03:16,699 --> 00:03:20,500
-Come on, Maz, let's warm up already.
-Don't mess with my pre-game ritual.

53
00:03:20,766 --> 00:03:23,098
Putting on mascara
is not a pre-game ritual.

54
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:25,259
-Let's go!
-Stop busting my chops, I'm coming.

55
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,267
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

56
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:28,595
What's up, brother?
Check it out.

57
00:03:28,966 --> 00:03:31,196
-My new Italiano mitt.
-That's cool, Alfonse.

58
00:03:31,266 --> 00:03:33,996
How much of a Guido
can you possibly be?

59
00:03:34,066 --> 00:03:36,296
Fuck you, Johnny.
I'll see you out there.

60
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:38,433
-What's up?
-Starting earlier this year?

61
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,025
Ready for the big day,
opening day, big game?

62
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:43,364
Maz, we stink evey year.
This is not a big game.

63
00:03:43,433 --> 00:03:45,128
-Yes, it is.
-lt's not a big game.

64
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:47,725
Yes, it is. I blew off
my daughter's ballet recital for this.

65
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,427
I've seen your daughter dance.
She sucks.

66
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,694
-No, she doesn't.
-Yeah, she does.

67
00:03:50,766 --> 00:03:53,394
-Which one, ballet or tap?
-lt all sucks.

68
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:55,832
-What's up, boys?
-What's up, Manganelli?

69
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,629
So, Maz, how's the wedding coming?
Are you nervous?

70
00:03:57,699 --> 00:04:00,692
I'm doing okay.
Gina's freaking out a little, but...

71
00:04:00,766 --> 00:04:04,133
My cousin is a good kid,
but she can be a real ball-breaker.

72
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:05,258
What are you going to do?

73
00:04:06,433 --> 00:04:07,525
All right, listen up.

74
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,627
Anybody who doesn't do a pre-game shout
with me right now is a fucking pussy.

75
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:13,258
Jerk off!

76
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:17,063
Did this jerk off
just call me a jerk off?

77
00:04:17,133 --> 00:04:19,897
Come on, let's not ruin another game
with a big fight, all right?

78
00:04:19,966 --> 00:04:21,126
Dave!

79
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,326
Arto.

80
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:23,822
Fellows.

81
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:26,725
Dad, I'm thirsty.
Can I have some?

82
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,462
No. Go steal that little kid's soda.

83
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:33,567
Bro, look at yourself.
You're an unemployed drunk...

84
00:04:33,633 --> 00:04:37,069
you play softball in corduroy
and you still live with your mother.

85
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:40,067
You shave your body hair,
wear Speedos down the short...

86
00:04:40,133 --> 00:04:41,964
and root for the Dallas Cowboys.

87
00:04:42,033 --> 00:04:43,898
Hey, that's America's team,
asshole.

88
00:04:43,966 --> 00:04:45,797
Not in Jersey, asshole.

89
00:04:45,866 --> 00:04:47,834
We grew up fifteen minutes
from Giant Stadium...

90
00:04:47,899 --> 00:04:49,561
you're a fucking Cowboys' fan?

91
00:04:49,633 --> 00:04:50,657
You're iust iealous.

92
00:04:51,033 --> 00:04:53,763
My softball team won this league
for years in a row...

93
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:55,266
going on five.

94
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:58,233
This year you're not getting
that trophy.

95
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,200
No?
Who's going to stop me, you?

96
00:05:01,966 --> 00:05:04,992
In high school,
I was the best baseball player.

97
00:05:05,066 --> 00:05:06,294
You were second best.

98
00:05:06,566 --> 00:05:09,228
I was the best football player.
You were second best.

99
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,995
And, bro, the chicks I got...

100
00:05:11,066 --> 00:05:12,556
were way out of your league.

101
00:05:12,633 --> 00:05:14,567
I did fine.
You fucked skanks.

102
00:05:14,633 --> 00:05:15,657
Skanks?

103
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:18,133
You're looking at the first guy
to bang Jan Martucci.

104
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:19,690
Wow, definitely not a skank.

105
00:05:20,533 --> 00:05:21,659
I'm sory.

106
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:24,528
-Lisa Riccio.
-Monica Nelson.

107
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,091
-Danielle Battaglia.
-Marisa Salvanto.

108
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:28,997
-Karen Dever.
-Tina Gardner.

109
00:05:29,066 --> 00:05:31,261
-Karen Dever.
-Pinky Calabr...

110
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:32,925
You iust said Karen Dever.

111
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,524
Well, we did more than once.

112
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,761
Okay, I guess
we're done here, bro.

113
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:39,802
Because you're out of names,
and I got like fifty more.

114
00:05:39,866 --> 00:05:41,697
I see you on the field, loser.

115
00:05:41,766 --> 00:05:44,360
Yeah, go ahead.
Run away, jerk off.

116
00:05:44,433 --> 00:05:45,491
Run away!

117
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:49,731
Bring it in!

118
00:05:50,633 --> 00:05:53,158
Now coming to bat
is Artie DeVanzo.

119
00:05:53,233 --> 00:05:55,963
Last season was a fine one
for DeVanzo, we all know that.

120
00:05:56,033 --> 00:05:58,866
-Come on, Artie.
-He batted .420 with 45 RBls.

121
00:05:58,933 --> 00:06:00,833
-Come on, Artie.
-Batter up!

122
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,690
He entgrs tDday's game...

123
00:06:02,766 --> 00:06:05,064
with a bl_ alcohol content
of .16.

124
00:06:05,133 --> 00:06:08,591
lf you kids are scoring at home, that's
an impressive mice the legal limit.

125
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:10,566
-Let's get it go, buddy!
-The DeVanzo shift!

126
00:06:10,633 --> 00:06:11,930
What do you say, Art?

127
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,730
-Let's go, Artie.
-Let's go, Arto. Let's go!

128
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,358
What's this shit, Manganelli?

129
00:06:16,433 --> 00:06:18,162
lt's my new defense strategy.

130
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,463
All right side is open for you, Artie.
Go for it, bro.

131
00:06:22,699 --> 00:06:24,395
All right, go the other way
with it, Artie.

132
00:06:24,466 --> 00:06:26,229
He's tying to fool you,
don't be stupid. Come on!

133
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,063
-Come on, Artie!
-Let's go, baby!

134
00:06:28,133 --> 00:06:29,065
Come on now!

135
00:06:30,766 --> 00:06:31,790
Shit!

136
00:06:31,866 --> 00:06:33,527
So, of course, he pulls it.

137
00:06:34,433 --> 00:06:36,560
Hey, the shift works good,
Manganelli.

138
00:06:36,633 --> 00:06:39,329
-Run, Artie, run!
-Artie, run! Run, man!

139
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,960
-Come on, Artie!
-Get it over there!

140
00:06:42,466 --> 00:06:43,398
Out!

141
00:06:43,966 --> 00:06:45,126
Nice hustle, Artie.

142
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:48,225
You're a fat fucking disgrace!

143
00:06:49,266 --> 00:06:50,824
He's a fat guy.

144
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:54,793
Come on, Dirt.
Start it off, kid. Come on now.

145
00:06:54,866 --> 00:06:55,833
All right, Dirt.
Come on, Dirt.

146
00:06:55,899 --> 00:06:57,231
Lay it in there, baby.
Come on, Dirt. Let's go!

147
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,268
What do you say, Dirt?
You character.

148
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,058
All right, Dirt.
Come on now.

149
00:07:02,566 --> 00:07:04,193
-Shit!
-Jesus Christ!

150
00:07:04,266 --> 00:07:07,030
You disappoint me as much as my kids
for Christ's sake.

151
00:07:10,233 --> 00:07:11,598
Okay, here we go!

152
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,099
Here we go, coming home.

153
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,428
Come on, get it in.
Get it in!

154
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,933
Hit the cut-off man!

155
00:07:16,766 --> 00:07:17,698
Yeah!

156
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:19,326
Cut-off man!

157
00:07:19,899 --> 00:07:21,128
Cut-off man!

158
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,224
Learn to love him.

159
00:07:23,733 --> 00:07:25,633
-You're killing us!
-The hell are you doing?

160
00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:29,397
One second! I'm having a smoke.
What's up your ass?

161
00:07:31,566 --> 00:07:32,999
-l got it!
-Shit.

162
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:34,662
Cocky prick!

163
00:07:37,233 --> 00:07:38,222
He's tagging!

164
00:07:38,566 --> 00:07:40,124
No, Dave, don't go!

165
00:07:40,233 --> 00:07:41,165
Hold on!

166
00:07:41,233 --> 00:07:42,200
Come on!

167
00:07:44,266 --> 00:07:45,198
Nice play.

168
00:07:45,266 --> 00:07:46,198
-Good job.
-You're out.

169
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:47,233
Good iob.

170
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:49,728
Come on, let's see it, Dirt.
Let's see it, Dirt.

171
00:07:50,633 --> 00:07:52,066
Fuck, no pitch.

172
00:07:53,033 --> 00:07:54,728
Hey, Tim, l want to let you know...

173
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,860
I've done a lot of thinking about
that talk we had last year.

174
00:07:58,233 --> 00:07:59,564
l don't even know if you remember.

175
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:03,063
l remember. When l overheard
you telling that joke at the bar, right?

176
00:08:03,133 --> 00:08:04,225
Exactly.

177
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,460
You know,
if we weren't good friends...

178
00:08:05,533 --> 00:08:07,057
l would've handled that
quite differently, right?

179
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,363
Hey, look, just so you know,
l don't even use the ''N'' word anymore.

180
00:08:10,433 --> 00:08:14,096
Like just now, instead of saying the
actual word, l just say the ''N'' word.

181
00:08:14,899 --> 00:08:17,061
l appreciate that, Artie.
That's a good start.

182
00:08:17,133 --> 00:08:18,122
Good for you, man.

183
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:20,028
That's okay, Dave.
Keep swinging.

184
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,466
As a matter of fact,
listen how l tell this joke now.

185
00:08:22,533 --> 00:08:24,592
A priest, a Rabin and a ''N'' word
walk into a bar...

186
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:26,725
All right, hold up, hold up,
hold up!

187
00:08:28,433 --> 00:08:29,991
Strike three, you're out!

188
00:08:30,133 --> 00:08:31,794
-That was...
-That's three.

189
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:34,566
Come on!
Let's get these guy!

190
00:08:34,633 --> 00:08:37,101
Let's get these punk!
He's nothing!

191
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:38,497
He's an asshole!

192
00:08:38,566 --> 00:08:41,126
A cocksucker!
He's a total piece of shit!

193
00:08:41,266 --> 00:08:42,665
You shut up, fatso.

194
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,902
-Hey, watch the name-calling!
-Come on, Dirt. Let's go now!

195
00:08:48,266 --> 00:08:49,198
Pop up!

196
00:08:49,366 --> 00:08:50,424
-You got it!
-You got it!

197
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:52,293
-Jesus Christ!
-Shit!

198
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:54,393
I'm not angy.
Just give me the ball.

199
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,465
You son of a bitch!

200
00:08:58,966 --> 00:09:00,627
Come on, guys.
Let's go.

201
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,661
We look like shit.
Come on.

202
00:09:04,266 --> 00:09:05,597
Hey, DeVanzo...

203
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:09,200
lf you're going to ask if you can suck
my left nut the answer is ''maybe''.

204
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:12,095
Do you ever think
that if l didn't exist...

205
00:09:12,433 --> 00:09:14,799
your life wouldn't suck so bad?

206
00:09:15,299 --> 00:09:18,997
We grew up the same age,
in the same town, at the same school.

207
00:09:19,066 --> 00:09:21,364
lf l wasn't around,
maybe you could've had what l have.

208
00:09:21,466 --> 00:09:22,592
Wait, l forgot.

209
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:26,668
lf l didn't exist,
you'd still be a total fucking jadrool.

210
00:09:33,033 --> 00:09:36,298
Come on! Get it in into second!
Come on! Force at second!

211
00:09:36,766 --> 00:09:37,733
Out!

212
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:40,724
He tripped him, Ump!
He tripped him!

213
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:42,224
l didn't see it.

214
00:09:42,433 --> 00:09:44,401
-Nice! Way to be!
-Cocksucker!

215
00:09:44,466 --> 00:09:46,457
-Way to be!
-No, no, no!

216
00:09:46,533 --> 00:09:48,501
-Get off of me!
-Come on!

217
00:09:51,933 --> 00:09:53,298
Put his head over here.

218
00:09:55,299 --> 00:09:56,289
Come on!

219
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:02,164
Don't stretch the shirt.

220
00:10:07,933 --> 00:10:09,059
This guy's such a pussy.

221
00:10:09,133 --> 00:10:10,896
Yeah? I'll La Motta
your face, okay?

222
00:10:10,966 --> 00:10:13,059
Yeah, let's go.
Returning for round two.

223
00:10:13,133 --> 00:10:14,725
Come on, who wants to dance
with me again?

224
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:16,893
Who's feeling lucky?
You feeling lucky?

225
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,661
You're lucky the cops
showed up, okay?

226
00:10:18,733 --> 00:10:20,360
I'm ready.
I'm not tired.

227
00:10:20,433 --> 00:10:21,866
Who's feeling lucky?

228
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,225
Don't eyeball me,
tough guy.

229
00:10:25,066 --> 00:10:28,263
When l was in the joint,
l fucked guys bigger than you.

230
00:10:32,066 --> 00:10:33,294
What the hell
are we waiting for?

231
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:35,493
Hey, did Dirt just say
he used to fuck guys?

232
00:10:35,933 --> 00:10:36,922
Never mind that.

233
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,594
We're waiting to find out how much
trouble you got us into this time.

234
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:41,133
Me? He started it.

235
00:10:46,899 --> 00:10:50,063
Alright. Listen up.
First thing's first.

236
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:51,656
-DeVanzo?
-Yeah?

237
00:10:51,733 --> 00:10:52,859
You're an asshole.

238
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,662
Now, as far as the fighting goes
between you're two guys' teams...

239
00:10:58,133 --> 00:11:00,067
this bullshit will not continue.

240
00:11:00,366 --> 00:11:01,628
lt happens evey year...

241
00:11:01,766 --> 00:11:04,132
and it's the first game of the season,
for Christ's sakes.

242
00:11:04,233 --> 00:11:05,700
So, ne_ year...

243
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:08,326
one of you guys' teams is gonna
have to play in a different league.

244
00:11:08,533 --> 00:11:09,500
What?

245
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:12,260
Wow, l wonder who you gonna
decide to ask to leave?

246
00:11:12,433 --> 00:11:14,526
I'm not gonna decide, ierk-off.

247
00:11:14,766 --> 00:11:19,135
Dennis Manganelli here suggested
you jerk-offs decide it on the field.

248
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,566
Whichever team does better
stays in the league.

249
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,930
The other team is gone ne_ year.

250
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,724
That sucks?

251
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:28,793
-You gotta be kidding.
-We are so fucked.

252
00:11:28,866 --> 00:11:31,198
l think we could do it.
All we gotta do is practice.

253
00:11:31,266 --> 00:11:33,461
Practice is for fags.
Hey, are we done here?

254
00:11:33,533 --> 00:11:35,023
Because I'm losing my buzz.

255
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,159
In two fucking seconds,
I'm gonna Taser you.

256
00:11:37,266 --> 00:11:39,826
Anybody here who's not an asshole
have a question?

257
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:41,232
l do.

258
00:11:41,366 --> 00:11:43,266
How come I'm the only one
who's locked up?

259
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:45,292
Be right with you.

260
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:51,801
How are we gonna deal with that?

261
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:00,428
Hey, Linda.

262
00:12:00,766 --> 00:12:01,698
Hey, Artie.

263
00:12:02,299 --> 00:12:03,767
Hey, et me buy you a drink.

264
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:06,700
No, l can't. l gotta meet my friends
over at Ducky's.

265
00:12:07,433 --> 00:12:08,695
What happened to you?

266
00:12:08,966 --> 00:12:10,058
Oh, this?

267
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,233
l saw three guys mugging
an old lady, so l got involved.

268
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:15,666
-Really?
-Yeah, she was a tough old broad...

269
00:12:15,733 --> 00:12:17,633
but in the end we got her purse.

270
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,158
Bye-bye.

271
00:12:23,866 --> 00:12:24,924
Good night, Ed.

272
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,900
Hey, Ed.
Get some beers over here.

273
00:12:28,366 --> 00:12:29,856
Whisky.
Come on.

274
00:12:30,066 --> 00:12:31,033
Jesus!

275
00:12:31,733 --> 00:12:33,701
You like you had
the shit kicked out of you.

276
00:12:33,766 --> 00:12:35,859
Yeah? Imagine how
the other guy looks.

277
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:40,264
l imagine a guy completely unharmed
with badly bruised knuckles.

278
00:12:40,866 --> 00:12:42,834
Don't you have livers to ruin?

279
00:12:43,366 --> 00:12:45,027
Totally fucked, this man.

280
00:12:45,466 --> 00:12:48,492
Listen, now that the games
mean something, we'll be great.

281
00:12:48,566 --> 00:12:50,397
This is just gonna help us
play better.

282
00:12:50,633 --> 00:12:52,328
Hey, Maz, do you think you can use
the fight as a reason...

283
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,868
to disinvite Manganelli
from your wedding?

284
00:12:55,033 --> 00:12:57,263
He's Gina's cousin.
He's gonna be there.

285
00:12:57,633 --> 00:12:59,999
And you're my best man,
so, you're gonna be there.

286
00:13:00,066 --> 00:13:02,660
And I'll have no bullshit
from either of you. l fucking swear.

287
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:04,324
Hey, I'm not one to start trouble.

288
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,334
Oh, my God, you fat fucking liar.

289
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,698
An insane thing to say.
Hello.

290
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,126
Hey, Gina.

291
00:13:10,266 --> 00:13:12,666
Tell her you're still single
for six weeks and hang up.

292
00:13:12,733 --> 00:13:16,260
Yeah. Yeah. I've been thinking quite
a bit about he cakes. Yeah.

293
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:18,062
Man, is he whipped.

294
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:21,231
All right.
Now, that Maz is gone...

295
00:13:21,299 --> 00:13:23,700
we can talk a little bit
about his bachelor party.

296
00:13:24,733 --> 00:13:28,464
Now, I've lined up five cousin ''hoors''
for the event.

297
00:13:28,533 --> 00:13:30,501
One of them is called
''The Pitching Machine''.

298
00:13:30,566 --> 00:13:32,534
Now, you're never
in a million fucking years...

299
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,535
eVer 90nna 9UeSS
why she's called that. Go ahead, guess.

300
00:13:36,133 --> 00:13:38,601
She shoots ping pong balls
out of her snatch?

301
00:13:40,033 --> 00:13:41,625
The name gives it away.

302
00:13:44,433 --> 00:13:45,923
Guys, let me ask you a question.

303
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,094
Why do so many diners
have a ''happy waitress'' special?

304
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:50,633
None of these waitresses
ever seem happy.

305
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,632
lt's true.

306
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,100
They should call it
a ''bitchy broad with three kids...

307
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,634
no husband and a shitty
apartment in Linden'' special.

308
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,658
Parts of Linden are nice.

309
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:00,893
Hey, Rhonda.
l didn't mean anything by it.

310
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:03,434
But not the part l live in.
What do you guys want?

311
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,593
Let me get a bacon,
egg and cheese on a hard roll...

312
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:07,896
with side order of fries,
cheese and gra_...

313
00:14:07,966 --> 00:14:09,024
and a bowl of gra_ on the side.

314
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,125
I'll have the same thing
plus pancakes.

315
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,997
-Chocolate milk?
-You know it, honey.

316
00:14:13,066 --> 00:14:14,033
Make it two.

317
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,732
I'll have an egg white omelet
made with vey little oil...

318
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:18,665
dy wheat toast
and grapefruit juice.

319
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:21,291
Oh, my God.
That's the gayest order l ever heard.

320
00:14:21,366 --> 00:14:24,199
In Massachusetts, that order
could legally mary a dude.

321
00:14:24,266 --> 00:14:25,198
Here it comes.

322
00:14:25,266 --> 00:14:27,826
Just placing an order like that
gets you kicked out of the army.

323
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:31,165
lf you put a construction helmet on that
order, it could join the Village People.

324
00:14:33,866 --> 00:14:35,595
Would you guys knock it off
so l can do my job?

325
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:36,758
Thank you.

326
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:38,390
All right, Maz.
That's an egg white omelet...

327
00:14:38,466 --> 00:14:40,366
dy wheat toast, grapefruit iuice?

328
00:14:40,433 --> 00:14:41,525
That right.

329
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:43,791
You want a side order
of cock with that?

330
00:14:48,566 --> 00:14:50,397
We got it in fresh.
It's delicious.

331
00:14:50,466 --> 00:14:52,434
-That people from Linden, l tell you...
-Trust me.

332
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,798
-G_ point.
-Come on!

333
00:14:58,233 --> 00:14:59,632
So, what should we do now?

334
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:00,789
lt's getting late.

335
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:02,766
Anyone with a job
should go home.

336
00:15:03,133 --> 00:15:06,125
-Good night, Maz.
-Vey funny, ball tugger.

337
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,633
Good night, Johnny.

338
00:15:09,266 --> 00:15:11,257
-Hey, l got an idea.
-What?

339
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:12,891
-Manhattan!
-What?

340
00:15:12,966 --> 00:15:14,365
-No way. Can't do it.
-Come on.

341
00:15:14,433 --> 00:15:16,560
The bars in the city
are open for four more hours.

342
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,591
Holy shit, it's midnight?
l gotta get home.

343
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,967
That's right, l forgot.

344
00:15:20,033 --> 00:15:22,331
lf you're home after midnight,
Gina locks up the pussy.

345
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:25,801
That's not completely true, all right?
Shut up, I'll give you a lift.

346
00:15:27,033 --> 00:15:28,125
Holy shit.

347
00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:30,834
-I'm hungy.
-I'm starving.

348
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:32,162
lsn't that the chick from the bar?

349
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,257
Oh, yeah!
That's Linda Salvo.

350
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,065
And she looks wasted.

351
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,934
Give me a quarter
you fucking bitch.

352
00:15:40,266 --> 00:15:42,097
-Here, whore.
-Fuck you.

353
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:44,566
I've seen her in this diner
twice before when she was trashed...

354
00:15:44,633 --> 00:15:46,225
and l banged her both times.

355
00:15:46,466 --> 00:15:49,128
Hey, I'm a little tapped.
You got a sawbuck on you?

356
00:15:49,233 --> 00:15:51,030
l usually gotta buy her
a Danish or something.

357
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,829
-All l got is four bucks.
-That'll do it.

358
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:55,391
-I'll see you tomorrow.
-Good luck.

359
00:15:55,466 --> 00:15:56,398
Don't need it.

360
00:15:58,233 --> 00:15:59,427
Hey, Linda!

361
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,332
Hi.

362
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:02,731
What are you broads up to?

363
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,589
Artie?

364
00:16:24,533 --> 00:16:25,761
Artie, wake up.

365
00:16:31,066 --> 00:16:32,727
Hey, good morning, Linda.

366
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:34,801
Artie, l gotta tell you.

367
00:16:35,133 --> 00:16:38,034
That was the worst sex
l have ever had.

368
00:16:38,233 --> 00:16:41,930
I'm catching shit from eveybody lately.
What was wrong with the sex?

369
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,800
You got all out of breath.
You're like a chubby panda.

370
00:16:45,866 --> 00:16:49,632
And then you finish in twenty seconds
and fell asleep on top of me.

371
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,031
lt was fucking horrible!

372
00:16:51,233 --> 00:16:53,997
Jesus Christ, l am so pathetic.

373
00:16:54,133 --> 00:16:58,627
l get drunk and then l wake up
ne_ to God knows what.

374
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,895
My shrink says that l do it
because l think...

375
00:17:00,966 --> 00:17:02,627
it's the only way a guy
could like me.

376
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,962
Be honest with me, Artie.

377
00:17:04,066 --> 00:17:06,432
The only reason you like me
is because l fuck you.

378
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,058
Not at all.

379
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,258
l mean, it's awesome.

380
00:17:11,066 --> 00:17:14,058
Look, l really like you.

381
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:17,399
What do you say, you wanna go out
on a regular date or something?

382
00:17:17,766 --> 00:17:19,290
What? Are you serious?

383
00:17:19,533 --> 00:17:22,058
Yeah, we could go out,
grab dinner...

384
00:17:22,133 --> 00:17:24,101
and we don't have
to fuck or nothing.

385
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:26,699
lt's vey fucking romantic, Artie.
Are you fucking retard?

386
00:17:26,766 --> 00:17:28,427
Well, do you know what they say
about retards...

387
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,730
they have huge cocks
and superhuman strength.

388
00:17:30,933 --> 00:17:33,868
Well, congratulations,
you're definitely not retarded.

389
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:39,200
Look, what l mean is, we could just hang
out and we don't even have to have sex.

390
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:41,359
Yeah, right.
You're gonna come to my house...

391
00:17:41,433 --> 00:17:45,563
in your nice date clothes and pick me up
with like flowers and candies?

392
00:17:45,633 --> 00:17:48,261
Flowers, maybe, but evey time
l buy a chick candy...

393
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,597
somehow, it never makes
all the way to her house.

394
00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:55,665
Come on! What do you say?

395
00:17:59,766 --> 00:18:01,165
All right, Romeo.

396
00:18:01,466 --> 00:18:02,626
lt's a date.

397
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,389
Great!

398
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,027
And since I'm guaranteed
no sex on the date...

399
00:18:08,099 --> 00:18:10,762
what do you say we take one
for the team right now?

400
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,663
Artie, I'm gonna be late for work!

401
00:18:12,733 --> 00:18:13,927
Come on!

402
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,096
Come on! An e_ra twenty seconds
ain't gonna matter. Come on, baby.

403
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:19,265
All right.

404
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:22,564
But this time you either gotta put
a rubber on or pull out before you come.

405
00:18:22,633 --> 00:18:25,363
Good morning, Artie.
Ready for breaMast?

406
00:18:25,433 --> 00:18:26,798
Sure, mom.

407
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,126
Hey, this is Linda.

408
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,360
Hello, Linda.
Would you like some breaMast too?

409
00:18:31,433 --> 00:18:33,230
No, thanks.
I'm not hungy.

410
00:18:34,066 --> 00:18:35,624
Can you hand me my jacket,
please?

411
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:38,589
Thank you.

412
00:18:38,933 --> 00:18:40,798
-Bye.
-Goodbye, Linda.

413
00:18:40,866 --> 00:18:42,094
Take care, Lin.

414
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:45,329
Hey, mom, sory
if you overheard anything.

415
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,925
-ls that your new girlfriend?
-Why? Do you like her?

416
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,299
l like any girl that likes my Artie.

417
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,491
Although clearly
she's been around the block...

418
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:55,830
so l would feel better
if you used protection.

419
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,958
Thanks for the advice, mom.

420
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,434
Hey, mom, could you make some
gobblegoo and eggs?

421
00:19:03,633 --> 00:19:04,793
-Come on!
-Hear that! Hear that!

422
00:19:04,866 --> 00:19:05,798
Safe!

423
00:19:05,933 --> 00:19:07,958
-Get them!
-Over there!

424
00:19:08,033 --> 00:19:09,330
Turn two!

425
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,662
-Get them.
-Come on!

426
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,458
-Safe!
-Shithead!

427
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:16,392
Come on!

428
00:19:16,466 --> 00:19:17,831
Not today, asshole.

429
00:19:19,233 --> 00:19:20,165
Nice shot.

430
00:19:20,233 --> 00:19:21,564
Come on! Come on!
Score!

431
00:19:21,633 --> 00:19:22,793
Come on! Come on!

432
00:19:22,866 --> 00:19:24,026
Go! Go! Go!

433
00:19:24,099 --> 00:19:26,034
Jeez, you're dogging the tying run!

434
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:27,965
No, I'm not,
I'm standing on the third.

435
00:19:29,766 --> 00:19:31,529
That pile of elephant shit.

436
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:33,765
-Papa!
-Shit!

437
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:34,765
Papa!

438
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,024
You're a retard!

439
00:19:39,099 --> 00:19:41,694
That means your mother
must love blowing retards.

440
00:19:41,766 --> 00:19:42,698
-Hey, fuck you!
-Hey, hey, hey!

441
00:19:43,066 --> 00:19:44,533
lt's a friend league!
Man, whoa!

442
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:46,227
-Stop!
-Fat piece of shit.

443
00:19:46,299 --> 00:19:48,291
We're all friends here, Maz,
do something.

444
00:19:48,366 --> 00:19:50,357
-Play the game.
-Get a sense of humor, pal.

445
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:56,198
I'm impressed, Artie.

446
00:19:56,633 --> 00:19:58,726
This is a really nice place.

447
00:19:59,000 --> 00:19:59,932
Yeah.

448
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,434
That Zagat dude
really knows his shit.

449
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,326
Backed Avedon.

450
00:20:05,733 --> 00:20:06,722
That's me.

451
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:10,125
-And gnocchi.
-That's me too.

452
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:12,224
-Thanks, man.
-Alright.

453
00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:13,232
Enioy.

454
00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:14,392
-Take care.
-Thanks.

455
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:17,425
So where do you work?

456
00:20:19,533 --> 00:20:21,194
At the A&P in Lyndhurst.

457
00:20:26,933 --> 00:20:28,525
This is so odd.

458
00:20:28,866 --> 00:20:29,798
What is?

459
00:20:33,033 --> 00:20:36,059
l mean, we've already slept together
three times, right?

460
00:20:36,566 --> 00:20:38,500
But, l mean,
we barely know each other.

461
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:39,867
l know.

462
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:42,395
lt's fucking hot, right?

463
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,190
No, it's not.

464
00:20:45,566 --> 00:20:47,158
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

465
00:20:49,466 --> 00:20:51,195
You work down at the port, right?

466
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:55,769
l was a longshoreman for nine years,
and then l quit last year.

467
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:57,528
Haven't had a iob in while.

468
00:20:57,599 --> 00:20:58,532
Why did you quit?

469
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,797
Mainly, my dad.

470
00:21:02,266 --> 00:21:04,393
Why'd your dad want you to quit?

471
00:21:05,266 --> 00:21:07,257
Well, it wasn't like that exactly.

472
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:09,358
You see, he died.

473
00:21:11,033 --> 00:21:12,557
Oh my God, I'm so sory.

474
00:21:12,633 --> 00:21:13,930
Thanks. l mean...

475
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,025
he had a heart attack on the iob.

476
00:21:16,099 --> 00:21:18,432
He installed cable TV for a living.

477
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:22,197
l had to watch him spend evey
waking hour doing a job that he hated.

478
00:21:22,266 --> 00:21:24,234
l mean the only time he was happy
was when someone would tip him...

479
00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:27,531
an e_ra twenty bucks to hook up
Cinemax illegally or something.

480
00:21:29,033 --> 00:21:31,831
You know, l can see
why you quit your job.

481
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,464
See, you don't want to like
spend your life...

482
00:21:34,533 --> 00:21:37,434
doing something that you hated,
just like your father.

483
00:21:38,633 --> 00:21:42,399
You now what? That sounds great, but the
truth is I'm probably just a lazy prick.

484
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:47,727
You know,
l think you're a cute lazy prick.

485
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:49,067
Thanks.

486
00:21:49,866 --> 00:21:51,959
But I've been doing all the yapping.
What about you?

487
00:21:52,033 --> 00:21:53,728
You got any stories
about your father?

488
00:21:56,099 --> 00:21:57,567
Yeah, l got one.

489
00:21:58,766 --> 00:22:00,666
Once, when l was five years old...

490
00:22:00,733 --> 00:22:03,531
my dad went out to get ice cream
and he never came back.

491
00:22:05,566 --> 00:22:06,863
You serious?

492
00:22:08,366 --> 00:22:10,027
Wow, I'm really sory.

493
00:22:10,299 --> 00:22:12,598
Don't be, shit happens.

494
00:22:12,766 --> 00:22:15,701
l can't imagine the pain
you must have been in because of that.

495
00:22:16,566 --> 00:22:18,864
But l think l got a way
to make you feel better right now.

496
00:22:18,933 --> 00:22:19,865
Oh, yeah?

497
00:22:20,933 --> 00:22:21,900
Waiter!

498
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,998
Order ice cream for this woman.
Pronto!

499
00:22:25,066 --> 00:22:26,055
Oh, God!

500
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,895
You're a fucking idiot, Artie.

501
00:22:27,966 --> 00:22:31,026
You know, I'm gonna have some too.
Waiter, three orders of ice cream.

502
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:32,362
Come on! What's up?

503
00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:34,600
Come on, Artie,
are you ever serious?

504
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:36,224
-No, and l tell you why.
-Why?

505
00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:38,666
The only people who get laid
Iess than funny fat guys...

506
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:42,430
are serious fat guys.
l feel sory for those assholes.

507
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:48,767
Artie!

508
00:22:49,099 --> 00:22:50,260
Artie, wait.

509
00:22:51,099 --> 00:22:52,761
l thought we weren't gonna
have sex tonight.

510
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,368
l know!
What are you tying to pull here?

511
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,861
Come on, Artie.

512
00:22:58,033 --> 00:22:59,864
Come on, this is important to me.

513
00:22:59,933 --> 00:23:03,494
That's cool. Although for
medical reasons I'll need a hand job.

514
00:23:03,566 --> 00:23:04,498
Artie!

515
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:08,636
Come on, I'll be quick.
It'll really help me get to sleep.

516
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,725
l can't mess up this car.
It's a lease.

517
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,859
Hey, l have great aim.
Just let me know where you want it...

518
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:15,094
ash tray, floor mat, change cup.

519
00:23:17,766 --> 00:23:19,097
All right, listen...

520
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:21,732
if you're really quick...

521
00:23:22,133 --> 00:23:23,498
I'll give you a blowiob.

522
00:23:23,733 --> 00:23:25,098
But you gotta be quick.

523
00:23:25,666 --> 00:23:26,997
Are you kidding me?
l hear you.

524
00:23:27,066 --> 00:23:30,627
When blowjobs go on too long, it's like
you chicks forget guy's dicks get tired.

525
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,100
Stop with the jokes. l gotta be up
for work early tomorrow...

526
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:34,258
so concentrate, okay?

527
00:23:34,433 --> 00:23:36,333
I'll be Hugh Fucking Downs.

528
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:39,529
-Who the fuck is that?
-He was the host of ''Concentration''.

529
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:40,567
Just blow me.

530
00:23:43,433 --> 00:23:45,867
l made tiramisu.
You kids want some?

531
00:23:45,933 --> 00:23:48,060
No, mom! Go back inside!

532
00:23:48,233 --> 00:23:49,996
lt's in the fridge
if you changed your mind.

533
00:23:50,066 --> 00:23:51,499
Back inside!

534
00:23:51,666 --> 00:23:52,633
Just go! Just...

535
00:23:53,533 --> 00:23:55,660
l am so embarrassed right now.

536
00:23:55,733 --> 00:23:58,668
You're embarrassed?
l just got cock-blocked by my mom.

537
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:04,257
DeVanzo...

538
00:24:04,433 --> 00:24:06,560
landscaping is
a vey strenuous work.

539
00:24:07,099 --> 00:24:09,933
Do you think you can handle it? Because
you're not in the best of your shape.

540
00:24:10,266 --> 00:24:13,633
I'll give it a shot. But you better
give me the name of your dietitian.

541
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,632
DeVanzo?

542
00:24:37,766 --> 00:24:39,165
DeVanzo! Wake up!

543
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,365
You got one house left.

544
00:24:42,566 --> 00:24:43,498
Cool!

545
00:24:43,566 --> 00:24:44,498
All right.

546
00:24:47,099 --> 00:24:49,091
Don't tell me is this place.

547
00:25:05,033 --> 00:25:06,967
Hey! DeVanzo?

548
00:25:07,466 --> 00:25:08,694
Hot enough for you?

549
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,865
l think you missed a spot
over there.

550
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,890
And another one over there.

551
00:25:37,066 --> 00:25:38,328
-Out!
-Fuck!

552
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,360
Way to be! Way to be!

553
00:25:43,033 --> 00:25:44,898
Dave, looking good up there.

554
00:25:45,433 --> 00:25:48,129
Hey, hey, hey! Don't ty to kill it
up there, all right?

555
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,100
Just get a nice base hit,
we'll start a rally.

556
00:25:50,166 --> 00:25:52,634
Come on, Maz? A home run ties it.
I'm going for it.

557
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,692
Don't be stupid. No one's hit one out
of here since Dave Della Ferra in 1989.

558
00:25:55,766 --> 00:25:57,393
Why don't you think
l can do one too?

559
00:25:57,466 --> 00:26:00,993
Because he bench pressed 400 pounds
and you sweat when you eat.

560
00:26:01,066 --> 00:26:02,363
So did Babe Ruth.

561
00:26:03,666 --> 00:26:05,258
The DeVanzo shift, guys.

562
00:26:06,766 --> 00:26:08,131
Meet the ball, Artie.
Come on.

563
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,169
Hey, Artie, you guys find
a new league to play in yet?

564
00:26:11,233 --> 00:26:13,861
Because one more out, chubs,
and we're 5-O.

565
00:26:14,133 --> 00:26:15,600
You guys are O-5.

566
00:26:16,033 --> 00:26:17,694
Home run coming up.

567
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,634
That would be impressive
after you spent all that energy...

568
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,565
mowing my lawn this afternoon.

569
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,724
I'm actually rooting for you.

570
00:26:26,466 --> 00:26:27,728
Here it comes, Tubby.

571
00:26:28,133 --> 00:26:29,862
And here it goes, prick.

572
00:27:05,933 --> 00:27:06,991
Yes!

573
00:27:07,066 --> 00:27:08,590
-Damn!
-5-O!

574
00:27:09,033 --> 00:27:11,593
5-O, baby! Yeah!

575
00:27:13,566 --> 00:27:16,967
DeVanzo, you shithead. Watching you hit
into that double play...

576
00:27:17,033 --> 00:27:19,297
makes me wish
l was 35 years younger.

577
00:27:19,366 --> 00:27:21,129
l know, so you could kick my ass.

578
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,691
No, because l could kick your ass
right now...

579
00:27:23,766 --> 00:27:28,203
but 35 years ago, l could have loaned
your parents the money for an abortion.

580
00:27:36,933 --> 00:27:39,299
l can't believe you can joke around
like this when you're about...

581
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:41,231
to get us kicked out
of the softball league.

582
00:27:41,666 --> 00:27:43,099
Maybe l should take up bowling.

583
00:27:43,233 --> 00:27:46,168
lt would be great to play a sport when
there's always a bar three feet away.

584
00:27:46,466 --> 00:27:49,128
So you can get even more drunk
than you do now for softball?

585
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,430
Will you two stop?
We're not out of it yet.

586
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:54,025
Maz, will you face facts?
We're out of it.

587
00:27:54,099 --> 00:27:55,897
we're not playing softball
in this league...

588
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:57,661
and you daughter
is an atrocious dancer.

589
00:27:57,733 --> 00:28:00,395
We're not done.
We can still make the playoffs.

590
00:28:00,466 --> 00:28:04,266
Look, l admit that technically
we can still make the playoffs.

591
00:28:04,333 --> 00:28:07,166
Now you admit that
your daughter's dancing is a disgrace.

592
00:28:07,233 --> 00:28:08,700
Fuck you, Johnny.
I'm gonna kill you.

593
00:28:08,766 --> 00:28:09,698
Go for it.

594
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:12,130
Maybe growing up
with a father in jail...

595
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,725
will help her dance
with just a hint of passion.

596
00:28:17,333 --> 00:28:18,857
-My man.
-You got it.

597
00:28:20,666 --> 00:28:22,065
Man, that was a tough loss.

598
00:28:22,433 --> 00:28:24,924
Yeah, l hate losing
to those fucking Guidos.

599
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,366
Tim, will you watch it
with that word?

600
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:28,999
-What? Guidos?
-Yeah.

601
00:28:29,066 --> 00:28:31,261
Man, you all call each other that
all the time.

602
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:32,960
Yeah, l know, but it's okay
when we say it.

603
00:28:33,033 --> 00:28:34,933
When you say it, it's racist.

604
00:28:36,166 --> 00:28:37,793
All right, Alfonse.
l respect that.

605
00:28:40,733 --> 00:28:43,395
Wait a minute, l don't respect that.
Guidos aren't a race.

606
00:28:43,633 --> 00:28:45,999
You're a bunch of wiggers
who dress like the Sopranos.

607
00:28:47,533 --> 00:28:48,625
Thank you.

608
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:51,368
l appreciate you setting up
the bachelor party...

609
00:28:51,433 --> 00:28:54,800
it's just l know you, all right?
No crazy shit. Promise me?

610
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:58,024
Absolutely not.
Come on, what are you, kidding me?

611
00:28:59,766 --> 00:29:00,994
Eight in the corner.

612
00:29:03,466 --> 00:29:05,934
Hey, Maz, I've been meaning
to ask you a question.

613
00:29:06,633 --> 00:29:09,602
I've been seeing this girl Linda
now for a little while...

614
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:12,692
and, l don't know,
she's sort of becoming my girlfriend...

615
00:29:12,766 --> 00:29:16,862
and, l tell you what,
l could see things getting serious.

616
00:29:17,166 --> 00:29:19,396
-That's good for you, Art.
-Yeah.

617
00:29:19,566 --> 00:29:22,626
But I'm sort of having
this one problem.

618
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,724
Let me guess...

619
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:26,064
you're tying to figure out
how to tell her about the herpes.

620
00:29:26,133 --> 00:29:27,464
No, no, she's got it too.

621
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,659
Congratulations,
you've found your soul mate.

622
00:29:30,099 --> 00:29:32,728
Thanks.
But the thing is this...

623
00:29:33,099 --> 00:29:35,625
She's what most guys would,
l don't know...

624
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,032
charitably call ''used goods''.

625
00:29:38,099 --> 00:29:40,625
Not for nothing, Art,
but you're what most girls...

626
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,861
would charitably call
a ''stinking piece of shit''.

627
00:29:42,933 --> 00:29:43,957
No offense.

628
00:29:44,266 --> 00:29:47,326
l was offended there for a second,
but then you said ''no offense''...

629
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,628
so now eveything is cool.

630
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,492
Anmay...

631
00:29:50,833 --> 00:29:54,997
the other day l was talking to her
and l was tying to figure out a way...

632
00:29:55,066 --> 00:29:58,399
to ask her how many guys
she's slept with.

633
00:29:59,166 --> 00:30:00,793
Why would you want to know that?

634
00:30:00,866 --> 00:30:03,630
l don't know, why does any guy want
to know? l just want to know.

635
00:30:03,933 --> 00:30:07,835
What l do know is she's been having sex
since she was 15 years old...

636
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:10,630
so that's 15 years in the league.

637
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:14,397
Conservatively,
she had to put away 25 or 30...

638
00:30:14,466 --> 00:30:16,991
-For what you told me about this girl...
-l know, you're right.

639
00:30:17,066 --> 00:30:19,500
She's gotta be in triple digits.
Anything less, is a lie.

640
00:30:19,566 --> 00:30:21,500
Anything more and I'm gonna pull
my fucking hair out.

641
00:30:21,566 --> 00:30:24,000
lt's all part of her past.
Why do you let it bother you?

642
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,989
Will you listen to me?

643
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,468
My suggestion
is just drop the whole thing.

644
00:30:29,666 --> 00:30:30,894
l don't think l can.

645
00:30:31,299 --> 00:30:32,528
All right, fine.

646
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,224
lf you're gonna ask her,
you gotta be prepared...

647
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:37,463
to answer the question yourself.
So what's your number?

648
00:30:37,633 --> 00:30:41,069
Let's see. l used to be better
at keeping track of this.

649
00:30:42,633 --> 00:30:43,861
Seventy three.

650
00:30:43,966 --> 00:30:45,490
Not counting whores.

651
00:30:45,733 --> 00:30:46,665
Six.

652
00:30:47,733 --> 00:30:49,360
You're right,
I'll drop the whole thing.

653
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:55,494
So mowing the lawns
almost killed me...

654
00:30:55,566 --> 00:30:57,261
but l was making
through the day...

655
00:30:57,333 --> 00:31:00,530
and then the last house turned out
to be that prick Manganelli's.

656
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:01,589
Oh, no.

657
00:31:02,666 --> 00:31:06,295
And then to top it off, he gets me to
hit into a double play to end the game.

658
00:31:06,366 --> 00:31:08,095
lt was iust so fucking humiliating.

659
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:09,996
I'm so sory, honey.

660
00:31:10,633 --> 00:31:12,430
Let's not talk about that asshole.

661
00:31:14,299 --> 00:31:16,734
You know, to tell you the truth,
all the shit with Manganelli...

662
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:19,963
and us probably getting kicked out
of the softball league...

663
00:31:20,833 --> 00:31:23,131
it's really not bothering that much.

664
00:31:24,266 --> 00:31:25,358
Why not?

665
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,095
l think it's because of you.

666
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:31,989
Yeah?

667
00:31:34,966 --> 00:31:37,730
Plus right now this weed
is helping out quite a bit.

668
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,102
You know, my shrink says
you're really good for my self-esteem.

669
00:31:43,933 --> 00:31:48,700
And out of all the guys l dated,
you're the only one she said that about.

670
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,398
Hey, let's fuck!

671
00:31:52,533 --> 00:31:54,433
Artie, l don't want to wake
your mom up.

672
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:57,264
Come on, don't wory.
My mother went to sleep hours ago.

673
00:31:57,333 --> 00:31:58,857
Artie, l don't know.

674
00:31:58,933 --> 00:32:01,595
Come on! These walls
are completely sound proof.

675
00:32:01,666 --> 00:32:03,156
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah! Of course!

676
00:32:03,233 --> 00:32:06,031
-Would l lie to you? Come on!
-No, you wouldn't lie.

677
00:32:06,099 --> 00:32:08,125
You could play drums
in this fucking room.

678
00:32:08,299 --> 00:32:11,201
You could do the solo from Tom Samer
in this fucking room.

679
00:32:12,066 --> 00:32:13,328
Who is Tom Samer?

680
00:32:13,766 --> 00:32:15,791
lt's a Rush song.
It's not important.

681
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:20,100
All right, I'm almost there.
Almost there.

682
00:32:20,333 --> 00:32:22,494
Just about there.
Almost there. Okay.

683
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:24,727
Not quite yet. Almost there.
Almost there.

684
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:25,960
Grab my balls!

685
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,394
Pinch my nipples!

686
00:32:29,133 --> 00:32:30,566
Pinch me in the back!

687
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:32,995
Harder! Harder!

688
00:32:33,099 --> 00:32:35,125
-That was too hard.
-Like this?

689
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,565
That's it! That's pe_ect.

690
00:32:36,633 --> 00:32:38,396
Artie, wait.
l think the rubber slipped off.

691
00:32:38,466 --> 00:32:39,398
Sory!

692
00:32:40,766 --> 00:32:42,233
Oh, no!

693
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,467
Shit!

694
00:32:45,533 --> 00:32:48,127
Nice hit. Nice hit.

695
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:49,491
Way to go, Alfonse!

696
00:32:49,966 --> 00:32:50,898
Yes!

697
00:32:51,133 --> 00:32:52,122
Come on, Art!

698
00:32:52,533 --> 00:32:53,761
Drive me in and we win it, buddy!

699
00:32:53,833 --> 00:32:56,301
Get a hit or I'm gonna shove
that bat up your ass.

700
00:32:58,866 --> 00:33:01,061
-Yeah!
-Vey good!

701
00:33:03,099 --> 00:33:04,260
That's a nice tattoo.

702
00:33:04,333 --> 00:33:06,767
l didn't realize it was
the Chinese word for Guido.

703
00:33:08,133 --> 00:33:10,966
Actually, this is the Chinese symbol
for ''fuck you''.

704
00:33:11,233 --> 00:33:13,599
You know, this was great tonight, man.
Getting the first win, huh?

705
00:33:13,666 --> 00:33:14,997
Yeah, was.

706
00:33:15,066 --> 00:33:17,296
Kind of reminds me how
I'm gonna miss playing for this team.

707
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,263
Hey, look, I'm gonna play
with my brother's team out...

708
00:33:19,333 --> 00:33:22,063
in Parsippany ne_ year. You want me
to see if they need an infielder?

709
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:24,658
No, get to Parsippany is a pain
in the ass twice a week.

710
00:33:24,733 --> 00:33:26,394
You get traffic, Route 46...

711
00:33:26,466 --> 00:33:29,299
Hey, guys,
it ain't over till it's over.

712
00:33:29,433 --> 00:33:32,459
Artie, you know I'm not the one
who want to give up but...

713
00:33:32,533 --> 00:33:34,694
we're 1-5. It's pretty over.

714
00:33:34,766 --> 00:33:35,824
Way over.

715
00:33:36,066 --> 00:33:38,227
Hello?
Okay, l tell him.

716
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,834
Hey, Art. That was Yogi Berra.
He says it's over.

717
00:33:41,766 --> 00:33:42,858
Jerk-off.

718
00:33:43,366 --> 00:33:45,994
There's a way to beat
Manganelli's team. We have to...

719
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:49,934
l know what you are going to say, Art.
We gotta blow out Manganelli's fitness.

720
00:33:52,966 --> 00:33:54,593
Dave, how are things at home?

721
00:33:55,266 --> 00:33:56,494
Not good, man.

722
00:33:58,566 --> 00:34:02,229
I'm holding in a huge piss,
so could you get to the point, shithead?

723
00:34:02,299 --> 00:34:04,291
All right.
We gotta practice.

724
00:34:05,866 --> 00:34:07,993
Aren't you the one that said
practice is for fags?

725
00:34:08,066 --> 00:34:09,397
Yeah, that's when
you wanted to practice.

726
00:34:09,466 --> 00:34:13,334
Look, this is a beer league.
Nobody practices and that can help us.

727
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,334
I've been hitting softballs
evey day...

728
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:18,335
and l didn't drink before the game
tonight the first time ever.

729
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,197
l could do that
for the whole season.

730
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:22,063
Look, I'm not saying
it's gonna be easy...

731
00:34:22,133 --> 00:34:25,296
Manganelli's team is gonna win
first place for the regular season.

732
00:34:25,366 --> 00:34:28,096
We're gonna have to scratch and claw
and get into second place...

733
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:29,929
and then beat them
in the championship game.

734
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,730
But if we start practicing,
l think we gotta a shot.

735
00:34:33,866 --> 00:34:37,632
Fellows, I've been paying softball
for a long time.

736
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,530
This is not the best team
I've ever played on.

737
00:34:41,033 --> 00:34:42,728
But it ain't the worst, either.

738
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:46,966
So, if we would actually
practice evey day...

739
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,360
then, like shithead says,
in this league...

740
00:34:50,433 --> 00:34:52,264
we gotta a shot to win at all.

741
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,424
How about it?

742
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,262
Let's have a toast.

743
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,799
To beat Manganelli!

744
00:34:56,866 --> 00:34:59,858
Toast, my ass! l gotta piss so badly
l could drown a horse.

745
00:35:00,366 --> 00:35:02,061
Talk so fucking much.

746
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:04,234
All right, that put a damper
on the toast.

747
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,097
What do you say
we just practice tomorrow?

748
00:35:06,266 --> 00:35:07,255
Salud.

749
00:35:08,966 --> 00:35:12,094
Bounding ball to the grindaloon
at third. He's got it.

750
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,868
All right. We haven't turned
a double play in like three years...

751
00:35:17,933 --> 00:35:20,868
so let's get two.
Come on. Artie is here now.

752
00:35:21,066 --> 00:35:22,033
Let's get two.

753
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,598
Good effort! Good effort!
Way to go! Way to go!

754
00:35:31,666 --> 00:35:32,598
Damn!

755
00:35:33,166 --> 00:35:35,396
You assholes know
I'm being sarcastic, right?

756
00:35:36,266 --> 00:35:37,665
Come on. Let's get two.

757
00:35:41,166 --> 00:35:42,861
-Damn!
-Ty not to spread your legs...

758
00:35:42,933 --> 00:35:44,400
like a two buck hooker.

759
00:35:46,533 --> 00:35:48,524
Good, Maz!
When you wait it on like that...

760
00:35:48,566 --> 00:35:51,660
you don't have to lunge for the ball.
All right. Way to be.

761
00:35:51,833 --> 00:35:54,893
Now, Johnny, l noticed you've been
dropping your front shoulder.

762
00:35:54,966 --> 00:35:56,831
Wait a minute,
you're telling me how to hit?

763
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,934
Please, I'm batting .687.

764
00:35:59,066 --> 00:36:00,863
lt's like telling Ted Williams
how to hit.

765
00:36:01,233 --> 00:36:04,634
Really? l always thought of you
as more like a Pete Rose type.

766
00:36:04,699 --> 00:36:06,827
You know, a shitty gambler
with bad hair.

767
00:36:07,966 --> 00:36:08,990
Hit it!

768
00:36:14,866 --> 00:36:18,563
Jesus Christ! It's like a bunch
of monkeys tying to screw a football.

769
00:36:20,833 --> 00:36:24,098
Nice hit, Tim.
Way to be. Beautiful.

770
00:36:27,133 --> 00:36:29,294
You know, Dave,
you might be a lefty.

771
00:36:30,333 --> 00:36:31,265
Yeah.

772
00:36:31,333 --> 00:36:32,857
Let's get two.
Come on!

773
00:36:37,566 --> 00:36:38,692
What the fuck are you doing?

774
00:36:38,933 --> 00:36:39,865
Jump!

775
00:36:43,366 --> 00:36:45,163
Second base is over there, moron!

776
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,594
Sory, Johnny. l...

777
00:36:46,733 --> 00:36:48,325
Jesus Christ!

778
00:36:51,699 --> 00:36:53,531
That is iust amul.

779
00:36:54,199 --> 00:36:55,258
Really?

780
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,800
-l thought l hit that pretty good.
-No, your hitting is fine.

781
00:36:57,866 --> 00:37:00,892
I'm talking about
that disgusting Guido pink shirt.

782
00:37:00,966 --> 00:37:01,933
Go home and change it.

783
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,524
All right, technically,
this is fuchsia.

784
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:05,261
Out of my sight! Go!

785
00:37:05,433 --> 00:37:06,695
I'm gonna throw up.

786
00:37:07,033 --> 00:37:09,866
-Jesus Christ!
-I'm going to see my brajool.

787
00:37:10,833 --> 00:37:12,300
-Let's get two.
-Come on, fellows.

788
00:37:12,833 --> 00:37:13,765
Come on!

789
00:37:17,966 --> 00:37:19,331
-Yeah!
-All right!

790
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,267
That's what I'm talking about.
Come on now!

791
00:37:22,333 --> 00:37:24,631
Now do that again and prove
that was not just luck.

792
00:37:24,699 --> 00:37:25,689
Let's do this.

793
00:37:27,733 --> 00:37:29,963
Great.
Get two now. Two.

794
00:37:30,033 --> 00:37:31,000
Come on now!

795
00:37:31,433 --> 00:37:33,924
-Yeah!
-That's what I'm talking about.

796
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,764
-All right!
-Way to be!

797
00:37:39,366 --> 00:37:42,164
-That's the way to do it.
-Way to be! Way to be!

798
00:37:42,466 --> 00:37:43,728
Come on now, folks!

799
00:37:44,266 --> 00:37:45,893
Come on, good, Guido.

800
00:37:48,533 --> 00:37:50,091
Eveybody hits.

801
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,028
-Run, Artie!
-Slow down, asshole.

802
00:37:55,233 --> 00:37:57,428
One hopper, DeVanzo.
he's got it.

803
00:38:01,066 --> 00:38:02,363
-Out!
-Yeah!

804
00:38:04,733 --> 00:38:05,995
Throw to first!

805
00:38:07,633 --> 00:38:09,533
-Out!
-Nice, Art. Way to pick it.

806
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:11,568
How about it? How about it?

807
00:38:13,466 --> 00:38:14,831
-Good play.
-Nice.

808
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:17,698
-Way to be.
-Don't get cocky, fucknuts.

809
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:20,031
All right, let's go.
No stick up here.

810
00:38:20,199 --> 00:38:22,794
No stick? Hey, Crispino,
what's your batting average?

811
00:38:22,866 --> 00:38:25,596
Fuck you, Johnny. Who keeps that
in slow pitch softball?

812
00:38:25,666 --> 00:38:27,998
I'm hitting .687.
Thank you.

813
00:38:29,366 --> 00:38:30,424
Nice shot!

814
00:38:31,566 --> 00:38:32,533
Strike three!

815
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:35,535
Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

816
00:38:37,833 --> 00:38:40,097
Nice catch!

817
00:38:40,166 --> 00:38:41,724
-Look at you!
-All right.

818
00:38:54,533 --> 00:38:56,933
What do you say now? Here we go.
Turn it now. Come on!

819
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,024
I'm on it, Johnny.

820
00:38:58,533 --> 00:38:59,465
Out!

821
00:38:59,533 --> 00:39:01,398
.463. Nice.

822
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:05,696
No carbs. Lobster,
prime rib, those little clams.

823
00:39:05,766 --> 00:39:07,734
Whatever you want.
Want to drive?

824
00:39:07,833 --> 00:39:09,198
-Yeah!
-I don't think so.

825
00:39:11,866 --> 00:39:13,128
What the fuck!?

826
00:39:17,166 --> 00:39:19,100
DeVanzo, you mothe_ucker!

827
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:22,428
Way to hit it, man.
Nice shot!

828
00:39:23,266 --> 00:39:24,426
Yeah!

829
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,762
-That's right!
-All right!

830
00:39:25,833 --> 00:39:27,801
-Congratulations!
-Nice shot!

831
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:30,460
Ten to five, baby!
Ten to five!

832
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,194
Nice shot!

833
00:39:46,233 --> 00:39:50,863
Step right up and shoot the geek.
One hundred shots for five dollars.

834
00:39:50,933 --> 00:39:53,333
Oh, my God! Yeah!
This is getting ugly.

835
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,627
-All right.
-Artie, knock it off!

836
00:39:59,833 --> 00:40:01,095
-Get him in his balls.
-Okay.

837
00:40:01,166 --> 00:40:02,155
Get his balls.

838
00:40:04,533 --> 00:40:06,865
On theses wheels l bet on Mom
evey single time.

839
00:40:06,933 --> 00:40:08,594
Because l love my mom, you know?

840
00:40:08,666 --> 00:40:10,395
-That's so cute.
-Thanks.

841
00:40:10,666 --> 00:40:11,963
All right.
Come on, ''Mom''!

842
00:40:12,033 --> 00:40:13,967
-Come on, ''Mom''!
-Come on! ''Mom'', what do you say?

843
00:40:14,033 --> 00:40:15,295
Come on, ''Mom''!

844
00:40:15,366 --> 00:40:17,334
One time with ''Mom''.
Just one time.

845
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,958
Come on, mothe_ucker ''Mom''!

846
00:40:19,033 --> 00:40:21,934
Mothe_ucker! Hit ''Mom''!
Mothe_ucker! Come on, ''Mom''!

847
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,026
Fuck! Fuck! Shit!
Cock! Fuck!

848
00:40:25,099 --> 00:40:27,933
Mothe_ucker! Let's get away
from this crooked fucking game.

849
00:40:33,366 --> 00:40:37,302
lt's hard to say
because l totally believe in God...

850
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,798
but l have lots of problems
with the Church.

851
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,491
l don't think l want to be married
in a church...

852
00:40:42,566 --> 00:40:44,591
because l would feel like
a total hypocrite.

853
00:40:46,199 --> 00:40:49,931
l sort of feel the same way, you know.
I'm not religious at all...

854
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,991
but my mother
went to Catholic school...

855
00:40:52,066 --> 00:40:55,035
so, you know, she would really want me
to get married by a priest.

856
00:40:55,099 --> 00:40:57,034
So l thought
of this great compromise.

857
00:40:57,099 --> 00:40:58,533
lf l ever get married...

858
00:40:58,599 --> 00:41:02,400
it's going to be by a justice of
the peace who's also a child molester.

859
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:06,291
You're so going to hell for that.

860
00:41:06,366 --> 00:41:07,526
What? Come on!

861
00:41:10,766 --> 00:41:14,532
Five dollars, hotshot!
Where are you going? Knock it out.

862
00:41:14,733 --> 00:41:16,724
You know where you mother is?
She's waiting to pick me up.

863
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,768
Five dollars. Purple monkey.

864
00:41:18,833 --> 00:41:22,200
What's up, slugger? Five bucks.
Yours, baby. Purple monkey.

865
00:41:22,266 --> 00:41:24,632
-Purple monkey, man!
-All right, Artie, you can do it!

866
00:41:24,699 --> 00:41:26,292
Purple monkey, man!

867
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,024
All right, baby.
That's a good start.

868
00:41:29,099 --> 00:41:31,000
Gotta have to settle
for a pink bear, man.

869
00:41:31,066 --> 00:41:32,727
-Pink bear, man!
-Come on, baby.

870
00:41:34,199 --> 00:41:35,792
You got nothing!

871
00:41:36,166 --> 00:41:37,190
Nothing!

872
00:41:37,433 --> 00:41:38,559
-All right.
-Dude!

873
00:41:38,766 --> 00:41:40,165
l got the look.

874
00:41:40,233 --> 00:41:42,030
-This is going to be the one, right?
-Purple monkey!

875
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:43,829
Because he ain't going
to get it today.

876
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:46,027
Loosing his hair,
down on his luck...

877
00:41:46,099 --> 00:41:47,727
perhaps too fat for his age.

878
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:51,361
He's with a hot chick
who is clearly out of his league.

879
00:41:51,433 --> 00:41:53,924
Forget about it. l don't even want
one of those stupid purple monkeys.

880
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,231
No, on this one, I'm getting you
a prize. l guarantee, all right?

881
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,165
-Okay.
-Here, catch, douche!

882
00:42:30,633 --> 00:42:33,158
Marie, you're a beautiful dancer.

883
00:42:35,733 --> 00:42:37,064
Atrocious.

884
00:42:37,233 --> 00:42:39,224
-Johnny!
-Unwatchable.

885
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:40,631
-Stop it!
-lt's amul.

886
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,927
-Lovely.
-No, it's not lovely.

887
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,491
Someone's gotta tell her.
She stinks.

888
00:42:45,566 --> 00:42:47,932
Look, l don't know what Artie
has planned for this bachelor party...

889
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,934
Honey, it's no big deal, all right?
Johnny, you ready?

890
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,696
And l don't want to know,
it's just my father might stop by...

891
00:42:52,766 --> 00:42:54,063
-for a little while.
-l know.

892
00:42:54,133 --> 00:42:56,067
And if he does,
would you please show some respect?

893
00:42:56,133 --> 00:42:57,065
Absolutely.

894
00:42:57,133 --> 00:42:58,327
Don't wory about nothing.
I'll bring him back in one piece.

895
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,526
-You see?
-Come on.

896
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:00,828
All right, honey,
I'll see you later.

897
00:43:01,866 --> 00:43:02,890
Whatever.

898
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:04,592
All right, let's go.

899
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:09,259
Gina, relax.

900
00:43:09,333 --> 00:43:11,699
They all have bachelor parties.
It's no big deal.

901
00:43:11,933 --> 00:43:16,597
Marie, stay away from the street,
sweetheart. Just dance on the lawn.

902
00:43:18,166 --> 00:43:20,430
Marilyn, it's not the bachelor party
that I'm worried about, you know...

903
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:23,469
it's just l can't relax when l know
he's going out with fuckhead.

904
00:43:23,533 --> 00:43:24,659
You mean Artie?

905
00:43:24,733 --> 00:43:26,724
Did you know that at
Carol Monteverdi's wedding...

906
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,768
he got drunk and he punched
the deejay in the face...

907
00:43:28,833 --> 00:43:31,393
because the guy wouldn't play
''Rock Me, Amadeus''?

908
00:43:31,666 --> 00:43:34,396
Well, we al know
he's kind of pathetic...

909
00:43:34,466 --> 00:43:38,061
but l like Artie, and l don't think
he's quite so obnoxious any more.

910
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,627
The 2-2 pitch to Birkenstock.

911
00:43:41,866 --> 00:43:43,299
Yeah!

912
00:43:43,366 --> 00:43:44,993
Down the line!
He may have it!

913
00:43:45,066 --> 00:43:46,431
lt's got the foul pole!

914
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:47,467
Home run!

915
00:43:47,699 --> 00:43:48,632
Nice shot.

916
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,092
Hey, no!

917
00:44:13,566 --> 00:44:15,124
Scavooch, what the fuck?

918
00:44:15,199 --> 00:44:18,135
And the crowd is going crazy
here at Bush Stadium.

919
00:44:20,066 --> 00:44:23,297
And DeVanzo is looking to lace
one back through the hole.

920
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:27,090
A little chin music.

921
00:44:27,166 --> 00:44:28,861
And he may charge the round.

922
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:33,330
That's okay, it's cool. If l have to,
I'll snort the fucking rag.

923
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:37,167
-Tone that spitter, honey.
-Come on, let's take a look at that.

924
00:44:41,233 --> 00:44:42,222
You got to have that.

925
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:44,200
Wait, you almost fucked us up
over here.

926
00:44:44,266 --> 00:44:46,757
-Dude, you got to catch that.
-I'm not catching that shit.

927
00:44:50,666 --> 00:44:53,032
-He's got his own stick.
-This is going to be a good one.

928
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:57,494
Pete LeCock!

929
00:44:57,666 --> 00:44:59,031

Hey.

00:45:43,099 --> 00:45:44,692
This is my cousin Mickey.

940
00:45:44,866 --> 00:45:46,333
He's a Boston cop.

941
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:49,458
Funny.

942
00:45:52,533 --> 00:45:55,866
Scared the shit out of you all Derek
Jeter-loving mothe_uckers, didn't l?

943

00:45:58,599 --> 00:46:00,090
-Sure, Maz.
-Thanks for coming.

945
00:46:00,166 --> 00:46:02,225
Hey, black man.
Hook me up with some coke, will you?

946
00:46:03,933 --> 00:46:05,594
Want a slice there,
Pitching Machine?

947
00:46:06,166 --> 00:46:08,066
No, l don't eat daiy.

948
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:10,234
The Pitching Machine
doesn't eat daiy.

949
00:46:10,666 --> 00:46:12,065
A lot of rules.

950
00:46:12,233 --> 00:46:14,133
Fuck you, ho.
You ain't taking money out of my pocket.

951
00:46:14,199 --> 00:46:15,827
Fuck you, bitch.
l saw him first.

952
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:17,731
You're the one taking money
out of my pocket.

953
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:19,267
Come on, ladies.

954
00:46:19,699 --> 00:46:21,725
Neither if you even have pockets.

955
00:46:26,433 --> 00:46:28,230
Honey, your prices are outrageous.

956
00:46:28,766 --> 00:46:31,929
l remember when a man could get
his cock clean for five bucks.

957
00:46:32,366 --> 00:46:35,767
I'll clean your cock for five bucks,
but a blowjob is still fifty.

958
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,799
Let me call my wife.

959
00:46:39,066 --> 00:46:40,397
Hey, there he is.

-Dennis.
-How do you feel?

961
00:46:43,866 --> 00:46:45,458
Did you come in a convertible?

962
00:46:45,633 --> 00:46:47,100
Don't be iealous.

963
00:46:47,466 --> 00:46:48,933
-Get a drink.
-All right.

964
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,763
Have a good time.
It's your last chance.

965
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,265
Hey, Ed, what is
the ''Elect Zinna'' bullshit?

966
00:46:55,166 --> 00:46:56,633
Fucking bitch.

00:47:04,266 --> 00:47:05,426
What happened to you?

968
00:47:05,733 --> 00:47:09,066
While l was getting a blowjob the other
whore punched my whore in the mouth.

969
00:47:10,466 --> 00:47:11,956
You better ice that shit, money.

970
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:18,596
Hey, thanks so much
for putting this together.

00:47:23,199 --> 00:47:25,634
Hey, listen,

974
00:47:25,699 --> 00:47:26,997
Yeah, l saw him.

975
00:47:27,066 --> 00:47:28,829
No fight, please.

976
00:47:29,199 --> 00:47:30,292

977
00:47:30,366 --> 00:47:32,926
Listen, Maz, I'm in a vey
different place right now.

978
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,833
-l really don't care about Manganelli.
-That's what l want to hear.

979
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:37,026
-All right?
-That's great, Artie.

980
00:47:37,099 --> 00:47:42,800
Okay, now, all hoors front and center!
Time to rape the bachelor! Come on!

981
00:47:42,866 --> 00:47:45,630
I'm not doing it!
I'm not doing it!

982
00:47:45,699 --> 00:47:47,930
-I'm not doing it!
-Tough shit. You're doing it!

983
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,437
-Have at him, ladies.
-You're a liar, you mothe_ucker.

984
00:47:52,599 --> 00:47:54,090
No! Please!

985
00:47:54,166 --> 00:47:56,327
Maz is getting his pipes cleaned.

986
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:57,594
Hang in there, Maz.

987
00:47:57,666 --> 00:47:59,429
Maz, you're down
for the count, bro.

988
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:01,991
Jesus Christ.
Artie? Artie? Artie?

989
00:48:02,066 --> 00:48:03,863
Hey, I'm a little busy right now.

990
00:48:03,933 --> 00:48:06,026
l thought you said
you're not gonna do coke anymore.

991
00:48:06,099 --> 00:48:08,000
Bachelor parties don't count.

992
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:09,961
Asshole, it's Gina's father.

993
00:48:10,566 --> 00:48:12,830
l would rather not be naked
in front of my friends right now.

994
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:17,360
Shit. He looks pissed.
l was hoping he'd be cool.

995
00:48:17,433 --> 00:48:19,901
You know, like your father was
in your bachelor party.

996
00:48:19,966 --> 00:48:21,524
Yeah, he was the best.

997
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:23,966
l can't believe l walked in on him
getting a hummer.

998
00:48:24,099 --> 00:48:25,067
What?

999
00:48:25,699 --> 00:48:26,632
Nothing.

1000
00:48:27,699 --> 00:48:30,897
Hey, this dude looks like he's going
to freak out. l better go talk to him.

1001
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:33,695
I'm supposed to go to confession
ne_ week.

1002
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:40,428
Cheap shit.

1003
00:48:42,366 --> 00:48:46,063
l don't know if you guys know this,
but I'm getting married vey soon.

1004
00:48:46,133 --> 00:48:47,327
Hello, sir.

1005
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:50,528
No, please!

1006
00:48:50,599 --> 00:48:53,797
l have a five-year-old.
Wow!

1007
00:48:54,733 --> 00:48:56,325
Boy, Maz has a big cock.

1008
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:00,302
I'm going to kill you,
you mothe_ucker!

1009
00:49:00,366 --> 00:49:01,958
He's got no respect for his elders.

1010
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:04,828
Get off him!

1011
00:49:05,333 --> 00:49:07,927
What the fuck is the matter
with you? Get off him!

1012
00:49:12,133 --> 00:49:15,102
Hey, thanks for letting me
do bumps with you.

1013
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:16,933
You want that blowiob now?

1014
00:49:17,166 --> 00:49:18,428
No, I'm good.

1015
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,126
That's a first.

1016
00:49:22,233 --> 00:49:23,928
She must be pretty special.

1017
00:49:24,566 --> 00:49:26,056
Yeah, she is.

1018
00:49:27,099 --> 00:49:28,124
Bye.

1019
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:29,132
Take care.

1020
00:49:31,699 --> 00:49:35,261
Art, Maz is pissing all over himself
behind the bar.

1021
00:49:35,666 --> 00:49:38,999
Well, it's not a bachelor party
unless somebody pisses his pants.

1022
00:49:39,066 --> 00:49:41,159
Actually, he managed
to get it out of his pants.

1023
00:49:42,966 --> 00:49:45,764
Look, Maz, l know l owe you
for that time you helped me out...

1024
00:49:45,833 --> 00:49:48,996
when l shit my pants on Mardi Gras,
but now we're even, man.

1025
00:49:49,066 --> 00:49:51,796
Wow! How much did you drink,
mothe_ucker?

1026
00:49:51,866 --> 00:49:54,994
Jesus Christ, Maz!
Maz!

1027
00:49:56,566 --> 00:49:59,558
All right, it looks like the well
is running dy finally.

1028
00:49:59,633 --> 00:50:02,500
Now, if you could just get your dick
back to your pants on your own...

1029
00:50:02,566 --> 00:50:04,557
eveything will be fine,
all right, man?

1030
00:50:05,766 --> 00:50:06,926
Hey, DeVanzo.

1031
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:10,860
l know why you're here,
but I'm not letting you blow Maz.

1032
00:50:10,933 --> 00:50:12,298
Of course not.

1033
00:50:12,466 --> 00:50:14,400
That's your job,
you son of a bitch.

1034
00:50:14,533 --> 00:50:17,934
In case you haven't notice,
the party is over. Get out.

1035
00:50:18,199 --> 00:50:21,567
All right, I'm going.
Say hi to Linda for me.

1036
00:50:22,133 --> 00:50:23,157
What?

1037
00:50:23,566 --> 00:50:26,763
Linda Salvo, your girlfriend.

1038
00:50:27,266 --> 00:50:29,632
She didn't tell you
she used to go to my gym?

1039
00:50:29,833 --> 00:50:30,765
No.

1040
00:50:30,866 --> 00:50:33,096
Yeah. Cute girl.

1041
00:50:33,666 --> 00:50:36,430
She earned quite a few free
membership months in my office...

1042
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:37,626
if you know what l mean.

1043
00:50:38,766 --> 00:50:40,563
Anmay, say hi to her for me.

1044
00:51:29,033 --> 00:51:30,193
Hey, honey.

1045
00:51:34,099 --> 00:51:35,829
You look like
you haven't slept a wink.

1046
00:51:36,866 --> 00:51:38,424
l taped the Yankee game for you.

1047
00:51:38,666 --> 00:51:39,598
Thanks.

1048
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:44,492
So, were you naughty
at the bachelor party?

1049
00:51:45,666 --> 00:51:47,133
Actually, l wasn't.

1050
00:51:49,333 --> 00:51:52,700
Linda, l have something important
l want to ask you.

1051
00:51:53,033 --> 00:51:54,898
Really? What is it?

1052
00:51:55,066 --> 00:51:56,590
Did you fuck Manganelli?

1053
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:01,697
Artie...

1054
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:04,232
Just answer the question, please.

1055
00:52:04,833 --> 00:52:06,630
Look, l don't want to talk
about this, okay?

1056
00:52:06,699 --> 00:52:09,498
l just... No matter what you think,
it's not important.

1057
00:52:09,566 --> 00:52:12,194
Could you just answer
the fucking question, please?

1058
00:52:13,666 --> 00:52:14,690
All right.

1059
00:52:15,066 --> 00:52:16,465
The answer is yes.

1060
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:17,657
Fuck!

1061
00:52:17,866 --> 00:52:18,992
How could you?

1062
00:52:19,066 --> 00:52:21,159
Artie, it was over two years ago!

1063
00:52:21,233 --> 00:52:23,793
Right, and l had to hear about it from
him. Why couldn't you tell me yourself?

1064
00:52:23,866 --> 00:52:27,063
How could l? You're completely
consumed with this guy.

1065
00:52:27,133 --> 00:52:29,567
You're finally just starting
to get over it.

1066
00:52:29,966 --> 00:52:31,433
Look, l don't think
about this jerk...

1067
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:34,333
and l don't want you to think
about him either. All right?

1068
00:52:34,466 --> 00:52:36,798
l just want us to be happy
like we are.

1069
00:52:38,699 --> 00:52:39,962
Come on.

1070
00:52:40,633 --> 00:52:43,534
This is too fucked up.
l don't think l can handle it.

1071
00:52:44,866 --> 00:52:47,164
What do you mean you don't think
you can handle it?

1072
00:52:48,033 --> 00:52:50,228
What?
You want to break up over this?

1073
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:53,090
You know what?
Yeah, l do.

1074
00:52:54,733 --> 00:52:56,564
Are you fucking kidding me?

1075
00:52:56,633 --> 00:52:59,363
Over something that happened
years before l met you?

1076
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:03,201
You feel bad so now you want
to make me feel bad too, right?

1077
00:53:03,433 --> 00:53:04,400
God, you're iust...

1078
00:53:04,466 --> 00:53:07,230
You're not a man!
You're a fucking little bitch.

1079
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:09,795
God, you're fucking unbelievable!

1080
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,695
l could fucking kill you!

1081
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:14,334
Damn Yankees fuck ass!

1082
00:53:14,533 --> 00:53:16,194
Nasty loser ass!

1083
00:53:16,733 --> 00:53:20,396
Take your stinking
Ioser jersey too!

1084
00:53:20,599 --> 00:53:22,830
Fat fuck! Fucking asshole!

1085
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:26,959
Can l get some more fries here,
Rhonda?

1086
00:53:28,066 --> 00:53:31,092
You know, women who date fat guys
are often mentally unstable.

1087
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:33,026
Yeah, it's true.

1088
00:53:33,433 --> 00:53:34,957
They call them ''chubby chasers''.

1089
00:53:35,033 --> 00:53:38,127
-Rhonda, I'm still here.
-One order of fries coming up.

1090
00:53:43,366 --> 00:53:47,302
Asshole! Asshole!

1091
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:48,797
Asshole!

1092
00:53:50,933 --> 00:53:52,798
I'm telling you,
this chick is good for Artie.

1093
00:53:52,866 --> 00:53:55,630
-l got my own problems.
-Thanks for the free bat, asshole.

1094
00:53:56,699 --> 00:54:00,898
Hey, Art, you know what?
You can't hold this on this chick now.

1095
00:54:00,966 --> 00:54:02,763
l mean l know it's a pain in the ass
to deal with it...

1096
00:54:02,833 --> 00:54:04,630
l can't deal with it. It's over.

1097
00:54:04,699 --> 00:54:06,895
This is the first chick
you've ever been serious about.

1098
00:54:06,933 --> 00:54:09,629
Come on, you finally met a broad
who doesn't care about your drinking...

1099
00:54:09,699 --> 00:54:12,692
or the fact you're 35 years old
and you still live with your mom.

1100
00:54:12,766 --> 00:54:16,167
And she doesn't mind that a man with
your weight should be about 6'2''.

1101
00:54:16,233 --> 00:54:18,064
Plus you factor
in the herpes thing and...

1102
00:54:18,133 --> 00:54:19,191
Asshole!

1103
00:54:19,433 --> 00:54:20,422
Enough!

1104
00:54:20,666 --> 00:54:21,860
Me and her are through.

1105
00:54:22,433 --> 00:54:24,799
So now who are you going to take
to my wedding...

1106
00:54:24,966 --> 00:54:26,058
if there is one?

1107
00:54:26,699 --> 00:54:28,361
What do you mean
if there still is one?

1108
00:54:28,466 --> 00:54:32,061
You know, Art, l asked you not to let
things get crazy at the bachelor party.

1109
00:54:32,633 --> 00:54:33,964
Now l got to be worried,
you know?

1110
00:54:34,033 --> 00:54:36,433
I'm afraid Gina's father is going
to tell her what went on there.

1111
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:38,390
No, he's not.

1112
00:54:38,533 --> 00:54:39,465
Yeah, how do you know?

1113
00:54:39,533 --> 00:54:41,831
He's not going to break
the bachelor party code.

1114
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:45,392
No man tells a woman what goes on
at a bachelor party.

1115
00:54:45,733 --> 00:54:48,167
So what happened
at Michael's bachelor party?

1116
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:49,560
Nothing.

1117
00:54:49,766 --> 00:54:51,757
So what went on
at Maz's bachelor party?

1118
00:54:51,833 --> 00:54:52,765
Nothing.

1119
00:54:53,033 --> 00:54:55,024
So what went on
at the bachelor party?

1120
00:54:55,099 --> 00:54:56,089
Nothing, baby.

1121
00:54:56,466 --> 00:54:59,993
We've been married for 43 years and
you still won't tell me what goes on...

1122
00:55:00,066 --> 00:55:02,125
at one bachelor party?

1123
00:55:03,333 --> 00:55:04,595
Fuck off.

1124
00:55:07,066 --> 00:55:08,465
No, I'm going to be honest
with Gina.

1125
00:55:08,533 --> 00:55:10,160
I'll feel better
if l just tell her what happened.

1126
00:55:10,233 --> 00:55:13,066
-Are you fucking insane?
-No, no, no, asshole!

1127
00:55:13,133 --> 00:55:15,863
Evey once in a while, some moronic
pussy does spill the beans...

1128
00:55:15,933 --> 00:55:17,059
and it's always a disaster.

1129
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:19,598
Forgive me!
Please, don't go!

1130
00:55:19,666 --> 00:55:20,928
I'll die without you!

1131
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,399
Get away from me,
you whore-lover.

1132
00:55:22,466 --> 00:55:24,900
You said you watched porno so you
wouldn't have to do things like that.

1133
00:55:24,966 --> 00:55:26,365
Look, l wish l hadn't done it...

1134
00:55:26,433 --> 00:55:29,129
but I'm insecure and it feels like
it's going to fall off.

1135
00:55:29,199 --> 00:55:32,533
lf it doesn't, give me a call
and I'll come back and I'll cut it off!

1136
00:55:33,766 --> 00:55:35,097
Cut what off, mommy?

1137
00:55:36,066 --> 00:55:38,091
-l know. l know.
-Here he comes, here it goes.

1138
00:55:38,166 --> 00:55:40,691
lt's a pe_ect day for softball
here at the stadium.

1139
00:55:40,766 --> 00:55:43,599
55 thousand on hand
for Johnny Trinno.

1140
00:55:43,666 --> 00:55:46,601
Bobblehead Day here.
l mean it's a great day for the kids.

1141
00:55:46,666 --> 00:55:48,634
All fans 16 and under will get one.

1142
00:55:48,699 --> 00:55:51,430
And can Johnny go
for the .700 batting average?

1143
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:54,094
-Do you ever shut the fuck up?
-No, l don't.

1144
00:55:54,466 --> 00:55:55,524
.698.

1145
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:58,232
-Nice one, baby!
-Go, Johnny!

1146
00:55:58,333 --> 00:55:59,766
-Come on, Artie.
-Big stick, Artie.

1147
00:55:59,833 --> 00:56:03,098
Would you look at Artie.
You know, he really thinks who he is.

1148
00:56:03,166 --> 00:56:05,999
Fucking best man at my wedding.
And he better behave.

1149
00:56:06,066 --> 00:56:08,057
Gina, you've got to stop.
Stop worying.

1150
00:56:08,133 --> 00:56:10,101
-Marilyn, stop worying?
-Yeah.

1151
00:56:10,166 --> 00:56:11,793
Did you know that
at Donna Delvecchio's wedding...

1152
00:56:11,866 --> 00:56:14,733
he pissed in the centerpieces
and got the priest high?

1153
00:56:16,466 --> 00:56:17,398
Okay.

1154
00:56:18,066 --> 00:56:19,966
Oscar Gamble stile, baby.

1155
00:56:22,566 --> 00:56:24,056
Way to go, fuckhead.

1156
00:56:26,066 --> 00:56:27,226
Yeah!

1157
00:56:27,699 --> 00:56:29,065
Yes, Artie!

1158
00:56:29,133 --> 00:56:30,532
Way to go, Artie.
l knew you could do it, pal.

1159
00:56:30,599 --> 00:56:31,532
We did it!

1160
00:56:32,066 --> 00:56:33,966
So back during
college basketball season...

1161
00:56:34,033 --> 00:56:36,160
my buddy Scheky tells me
he's got this system.

1162
00:56:36,233 --> 00:56:39,532
He says it's an absolute lock
when you have this combination, right?

1163
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:42,160
Big East team on the road...

1164
00:56:42,233 --> 00:56:45,634
give them less than six points
with a white point guard, all right?

1165
00:56:45,699 --> 00:56:48,498
So l bet St. John's against Duke
and l lose big...

1166
00:56:48,566 --> 00:56:49,760
l mean, really big, right?

1167
00:56:49,833 --> 00:56:51,391
So l said to Scheky,
l go, ''Look, man...

1168
00:56:51,466 --> 00:56:53,696
the only time a white point guard
is a good thing...

1169
00:56:53,766 --> 00:56:56,234
is when your sister tells you
she's dating a point guard.''

1170
00:57:00,433 --> 00:57:02,492
Hey, Tim,
l didn't see you there, man.

1171
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:05,124
That's a funny ioke, man.

1172
00:57:05,666 --> 00:57:06,860
You like that ioke?

1173
00:57:07,366 --> 00:57:08,765
Yeah, what's not to like about it?

1174
00:57:08,833 --> 00:57:10,494
lt's about how you guys suck
at basketball...

1175
00:57:10,566 --> 00:57:12,056
and how good we fuck
your women.

1176
00:57:13,033 --> 00:57:14,762
l never thought about it like that.

1177
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:19,995
-We got a better lineup than they got.
-Totally.

1178
00:57:20,066 --> 00:57:22,125
That's why they slacked off
the second half.

1179
00:57:22,199 --> 00:57:24,566
He got the champagne...

1180
00:57:24,633 --> 00:57:25,964
-Hey, guys!
-Hey!

1181
00:57:26,033 --> 00:57:29,093
-What's up? How you doing?
-Hey, Art, listen to this.

1182
00:57:29,166 --> 00:57:31,566
Carino Autobody lost to
Muchugrasso Overhead Doors...

1183
00:57:31,633 --> 00:57:33,464
so now we're tied for second
with Carino.

1184
00:57:33,533 --> 00:57:36,093
-Hey, our last game is against Carino!
-That's right.

1185
00:57:36,166 --> 00:57:38,031
lt's going to come down
to the last day here.

1186
00:57:38,099 --> 00:57:41,365
Does Ed's Bar and Swill win the right to
face Manganelli in the championship...

1187
00:57:41,433 --> 00:57:42,798
and save the team?

1188
00:57:42,866 --> 00:57:44,493
Or perhaps even more dramatic...

1189
00:57:44,566 --> 00:57:47,558
does Joking Johnny Trinno
bat .700?

1190
00:57:47,633 --> 00:57:51,194
Asshole, will you forget about
your batting average for one second?

1191
00:57:51,266 --> 00:57:53,200
We gotta beat
that prick Manganelli.

1192
00:57:53,333 --> 00:57:56,325
Artie, what exactly do you have
against my cousin?

1193
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,994
Well, number one, he's a prick.
Number two, he's a cock.

1194
00:57:59,066 --> 00:58:00,226
Number three, he's a dick.

1195
00:58:00,266 --> 00:58:03,235
Congratulations, you know
three different words for ''penis''.

1196
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:05,097
Four, now that
you taught me ''penis''.

1197
00:58:05,566 --> 00:58:07,727
All right, guys, relax, okay?
Does anybody need a drink?

1198
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:10,030
-Eveybody be nice.
-All right, let's change the subject.

1199
00:58:10,099 --> 00:58:14,366
Artie, are you bringing Linda to the
wedding or are you guys still broken up?

1200
00:58:14,433 --> 00:58:16,196
No, we're broken up for good.

1201
00:58:16,333 --> 00:58:18,995
You know, Gina actually offered
to set you up with one of her cousins.

1202
00:58:19,066 --> 00:58:22,194
Hey, great! l heard your cousin
Manganelli gives a mean blowjob.

1203
00:58:22,333 --> 00:58:24,961
You know what, Artie?
You sit on this and rotate.

1204
00:58:25,033 --> 00:58:27,866
Gina, your flirting is making eveyone
at the table uncomfortable.

1205
00:58:27,933 --> 00:58:30,800
Come on, Art, take it down a notch.
she's just tying to help you.

1206
00:58:30,866 --> 00:58:33,096
Hey, I'm not some loser
who can't get a...

1207
00:58:33,166 --> 00:58:35,430
Wait, you're not talking about
your cousin Tracy with the tits?

1208
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:37,331
No, Tracy's married now,
thank you.

1209
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:41,393
Hey, I'm not some loser who can't get
a date! I'm doing just fine on my own.

1210
00:58:42,366 --> 00:58:44,095
Hello, is Karen Denver there?

1211
00:58:44,566 --> 00:58:46,932
Karen? It's Artie DeVanzo!

1212
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:49,666
Yeah, Artie, from Union High!

1213
00:58:50,099 --> 00:58:52,796
That's right, we haven't spoken
since l took you to the prom.

1214
00:58:54,433 --> 00:58:56,628
That's right, l did call you
from jail after.

1215
00:58:57,166 --> 00:59:01,102
Well, listen, l was just sitting
in the office here...

1216
00:59:01,166 --> 00:59:04,033
and l was wondering...
Do you remember my friend Maz?

1217
00:59:04,933 --> 00:59:06,764
Yeah, well, he's getting married
this weekend...

1218
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:08,665
and l was wondering
if you want_ tD go with me.

1219
00:59:09,333 --> 00:59:12,359
Yeah, l was remembering
all the fun times we used to have.

1220
00:59:13,733 --> 00:59:15,166
What do you mean ''what fun''?

1221
00:59:15,366 --> 00:59:17,766
By my count, we banged
at least 26 times. Hello?

1222
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:22,300
No kidding, Gigi.
You're strictly into chicks now?

1223
00:59:22,633 --> 00:59:25,101
Hey, did l have something
to do with that?

1224
00:59:25,966 --> 00:59:26,990
l did?

1225
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,264
So then you got divorced
from that guy too?

1226
00:59:31,333 --> 00:59:33,130
Boy, Brenda, you really know
how to pick them.

1227
00:59:34,066 --> 00:59:35,328
I'm iust teasing you.

1228
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,060
Yeah, yeah, thanks.
It's really great to talk to you too.

1229
00:59:39,133 --> 00:59:42,000
I'm so glad that nerd at the libray
taught me how to Google.

1230
00:59:42,199 --> 00:59:43,895
Listen, let me tell you
why I'm calling...

1231
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:46,492
You know already? Really?

1232
00:59:49,133 --> 00:59:52,762
Right, l did tell you l'd pay you back
that 200 bucks l borrowed from you...

1233
00:59:52,833 --> 00:59:54,323
no matter how long it took.

1234
00:59:59,966 --> 01:00:00,990
Hi, this is Linda.

1235
01:00:01,066 --> 01:00:04,092
l can't come to the phone right now,
so, please, leave me a message.

1236
01:00:04,766 --> 01:00:06,529
Hey, it's Artie.

1237
01:00:06,599 --> 01:00:09,398
l know we haven't talked in awhile,
so this is kind of aw_ard...

1238
01:00:09,466 --> 01:00:10,558
but...

1239
01:00:11,033 --> 01:00:12,796
Look, eveything was my fault.

1240
01:00:12,866 --> 01:00:15,733
l know l get crazy sometimes
you know and...

1241
01:00:16,333 --> 01:00:17,300
well...

1242
01:00:18,033 --> 01:00:18,965
l don't know, listen...

1243
01:00:19,033 --> 01:00:22,264
I'm going to stop talking into your
machine before this gets embarrassing.

1244
01:00:22,333 --> 01:00:23,732
Give me a call if you get a chance.

1245
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:25,597
But l miss you.

1246
01:00:25,766 --> 01:00:26,926
l miss you a lot.

1247
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:28,232
Bye.

1248
01:00:29,833 --> 01:00:31,027
So, you're going to call him?

1249
01:00:33,133 --> 01:00:34,225
l don't know.

1250
01:00:34,433 --> 01:00:37,266
l mean l still really care about Artie,
but he really hurt me.

1251
01:00:39,333 --> 01:00:43,394
Either way, keep this quiet,
because it was a big mistake.

1252
01:00:43,466 --> 01:00:44,990
Why? Because I'm black?

1253
01:00:45,233 --> 01:00:47,599
No, because
you're fucking married!

1254
01:00:48,633 --> 01:00:50,225
All right, my bad.

1255
01:00:53,099 --> 01:00:54,294
What do you say now, Dave?

1256
01:00:54,366 --> 01:00:55,856
Hang in there.

1257
01:00:55,933 --> 01:00:57,992
-Hang in there.
-Land her, baby.

1258
01:00:58,066 --> 01:01:00,694
Nice and easy. Nice and easy.
Bring the ball. Come on, Dave.

1259
01:01:00,766 --> 01:01:02,393
Run him on now.
Come on!

1260
01:01:03,066 --> 01:01:03,998
Strike three!

1261
01:01:04,066 --> 01:01:06,057
Oh, my God! l can't wait
to go home and get high!

1262
01:01:06,133 --> 01:01:07,259
Holy shit.

1263
01:01:07,333 --> 01:01:09,460
Some of the greats
strike out, Dave.

1264
01:01:09,533 --> 01:01:13,367
That's right, striking out in slow pitch
softball is nothing to be ashamed of.

1265
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:15,295
All right, Johnny.
All right, Johnny!

1266
01:01:15,366 --> 01:01:16,958
lt's all you, baby!
Bring me in.

1267
01:01:17,166 --> 01:01:20,397
Two outs here in the last inning,
with the winning run on second.

1268
01:01:20,466 --> 01:01:23,333
Who would you want up more
than Johnny Trinno?

1269
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:25,231
lt's been a magical year
for Johnny...

1270
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:28,827
as he comes to the last game
with a.699 average.

1271
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:30,424
All right, come on,
it's getting dark.

1272
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:33,401
Yet Trinno's star shines
as bright as ever.

1273
01:01:34,433 --> 01:01:35,764
Nice hit, Johnny!
That's it.

1274
01:01:35,833 --> 01:01:38,427
Come on, Maz, go!
Screw your slide!

1275
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:40,764
Go, come on, slide, slide!

1276
01:01:40,833 --> 01:01:43,631
Your slide! Head for a slide!
Head for a slide!

1277
01:01:46,366 --> 01:01:47,298
Shit.

1278
01:01:47,366 --> 01:01:49,197
What did you slide for?
They didn't even throw the ball.

1279
01:01:51,933 --> 01:01:53,332
Why the hell did you tell me
to slide?

1280
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:56,699
l was just fucking with you.
We're in the championship!

1281
01:02:05,866 --> 01:02:08,664
Listen, Johnny, l don't have a date
for the wedding yet.

1282
01:02:08,733 --> 01:02:11,930
What? l thought you took care ofthat.
The wedding is this afternoon.

1283
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,197
l know, l struck out all over the place.
Hey, do you think Marilyn...

1284
01:02:15,266 --> 01:02:17,461
could get one of her friends
to go with me last minute?

1285
01:02:17,533 --> 01:02:22,994
Look, Art, Marilyn's female friends are
all lawyers, bankers and executives...

1286
01:02:24,133 --> 01:02:26,294
So what are you saying,
that they're too good for me?

1287
01:02:26,433 --> 01:02:29,596
No, no, l was tying to let
the silence say it for me.

1288
01:02:29,733 --> 01:02:32,395
Artie, even if Marilyn could help you,
it's too late.

1289
01:02:32,466 --> 01:02:35,526
Nobody cares if you have a date.
Just come by yourself.

1290
01:02:35,966 --> 01:02:39,265
l can't do that, Johnny.
That's all right, man.

1291
01:02:39,333 --> 01:02:41,324
l still got one chick left
l could call.

1292
01:02:55,166 --> 01:02:57,225
lt's almost time to get it started.
Where the hell is Artie?

1293
01:02:57,300 --> 01:02:59,928
l just called the house. His mom said
some girl came and picked him up.

1294
01:03:00,033 --> 01:03:01,898
What the...?
l don't believe this shit!

1295
01:03:05,566 --> 01:03:08,694
Look, Johnny, if this scumbag
isn't here in five minutes...

1296
01:03:08,766 --> 01:03:11,394
we start without him.
You step in as best man.

1297
01:03:11,466 --> 01:03:12,398
Yes, sir.

1298
01:03:17,133 --> 01:03:19,761
That's so sad that you
and your girlfriend broke up.

1299
01:03:19,833 --> 01:03:21,596
You're such a sweetie.

1300
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:23,631
Here. You want a bump
to cheer you up?

1301
01:03:24,033 --> 01:03:25,694
No, that's all right.
Maybe later.

1302
01:03:25,933 --> 01:03:27,958
You know you just flew through
a stop sign, right?

1303
01:03:29,166 --> 01:03:32,897
Who are you to talk, silly?
You don't even have a driver's license.

1304
01:03:33,833 --> 01:03:35,698
Well, at least
we're making good time.

1305
01:03:35,766 --> 01:03:37,597
All right, the church is like
two minutes from here...

1306
01:03:37,666 --> 01:03:39,463
so, just go straight,
but slow down.

1307
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:42,667
Slow down! Slow down!
Pitching Machine, look out!

1308
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:50,131
l saved us!

1309
01:03:50,566 --> 01:03:52,033
Yeah, you're a real hero.

1310
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:53,662
Come on, let's go.

1311
01:03:53,733 --> 01:03:55,223
Wait, let me powder my nose.

1312
01:03:58,866 --> 01:04:00,390
Fuck me.

1313
01:04:06,533 --> 01:04:09,434
Hey, DeVanzo, you're free to go.

1314
01:04:10,333 --> 01:04:11,595
Hey, what time is it?

1315
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:12,789
Five a.m..

1316
01:04:13,633 --> 01:04:14,861
Shit!

1317
01:04:18,366 --> 01:04:21,358
-Look, l know l messed up.
-Messed up...

1318
01:04:21,433 --> 01:04:23,060
All right, screwed up.
fucked up!

1319
01:04:23,133 --> 01:04:26,159
-l really am sory.
-Stop, all right? Don't even...

1320
01:04:26,666 --> 01:04:29,965
We've been friends for 30 years.
You're my best man.

1321
01:04:30,033 --> 01:04:32,365
How could you miss my wedding?
What the hell is the matter with you?

1322
01:04:32,433 --> 01:04:33,957
Man, I'm sory.

1323
01:04:34,033 --> 01:04:36,092
Well, I'm not. At least the fucking
Pitching Machine...

1324
01:04:36,166 --> 01:04:37,190
didn't end up on my wedding.

1325
01:04:37,266 --> 01:04:39,291
Look, l don't know how many times
l have to say this...

1326
01:04:39,366 --> 01:04:40,799
but l really am sory!

1327
01:04:40,866 --> 01:04:42,663
You know, those words,
they have no meaning coming from you...

1328
01:04:42,733 --> 01:04:44,667
all right?
They're shit.

1329
01:04:44,733 --> 01:04:47,065
I've had enough of your ''I'm sorys''
to last my lifetime.

1330
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:48,526
''I'm sory l missed your wedding.''

1331
01:04:48,599 --> 01:04:50,295
I'm sory l started
that fight with Manganelli.

1332
01:04:50,366 --> 01:04:52,994
I'm sory l got drunk and stole
your dad's ice cream truck.''

1333
01:04:53,066 --> 01:04:54,055
l mean l could go on...

1334
01:04:54,133 --> 01:04:56,499
Wait, the ice cream truck thing
l was 12 years old.

1335
01:04:56,566 --> 01:04:58,158
Yeah, and you haven't changed
a bit!

1336
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:02,401
You selfish prick! You even manage
to make my wedding about you.

1337
01:05:02,466 --> 01:05:05,663
Obviously you don't want to be around me
and don't blame you.

1338
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,331
I'm going to quit the team.

1339
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:09,027
Team? What team?

1340
01:05:09,099 --> 01:05:11,534
We're going to lose the championship and
then the team's over because of you...

1341
01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:14,160
so don't go fucking talking to me
about the team, all right?

1342
01:05:14,233 --> 01:05:15,894
-What the fuck?
-What...

1343
01:05:16,266 --> 01:05:17,324
-Hey, it's Dirt!
-Dirt!

1344
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:19,300
-Johnny.
-Man, hury up! Call an ambulance.

1345
01:05:19,366 --> 01:05:20,697
Dirt? Dirt?

1346
01:05:20,766 --> 01:05:23,064
We need an ambulance
here at the Tamblin Field.

1347
01:05:23,133 --> 01:05:24,760
-Shit, Dirt.
-Hang on, we're getting help.

1348
01:05:31,233 --> 01:05:35,033
-l can't believe you really did it.
-He always said that's what he wanted.

1349
01:05:35,099 --> 01:05:37,000
l want to go out iust like that.

1350
01:05:40,033 --> 01:05:43,230
Gentlemen, later today
we're playing for the championship...

1351
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:46,269
and for the survival of
Ed's Bar and Swill softball team.

1352
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:48,365
But right now
l want to do a toast...

1353
01:05:48,433 --> 01:05:51,266
to a fallen friend
and a teammate, Dirt...

1354
01:05:51,333 --> 01:05:53,733
the greatest softball pitcher
of all time.

1355
01:05:54,633 --> 01:05:55,565
To Dirt.

1356
01:05:55,900 --> 01:05:57,595
-Dirt.
-Dirt.

1357
01:06:00,733 --> 01:06:02,826
Hey, Ed, what do you say?
Set up some more.

1358
01:06:03,033 --> 01:06:04,796
To be honest,
if Dirt hasn't died...

1359
01:06:04,866 --> 01:06:07,858
l wouldn't even be talking
to you right now...

1360
01:06:07,933 --> 01:06:11,164
but l still don't want
our friendship to end, all right?

1361
01:06:11,233 --> 01:06:12,598
Me neither, man.

1362
01:06:12,666 --> 01:06:14,224
Look, Maz,
this ain't a good excuse...

1363
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:15,858
but l just couldn't show up
to your wedding...

1364
01:06:15,933 --> 01:06:18,424
in front of fucking Manganelli
without a date.

1365
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:21,162
lt would have been too humiliating
after that thing with Linda.

1366
01:06:21,366 --> 01:06:24,426
Artie, don't let that prick get to you.
That's what fucks eveything up.

1367
01:06:24,733 --> 01:06:26,792
That's when you become
the asshole.

1368
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:30,565
l want to beat him in softball too.
And ends there.

1369
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:33,064
You can't let that guy ruin
your whole freaking life.

1370
01:06:33,766 --> 01:06:35,996
l know, l know.
You're right, man. You're right.

1371
01:06:36,366 --> 01:06:37,765
l mean, you got to let it go.

1372
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:41,333
And if he doesn't, you should.

1373
01:06:42,099 --> 01:06:43,965
Fuck it.
I'm just going to let it go.

1374
01:06:44,033 --> 01:06:45,967
I'm done worying about
Dennis Manganelli.

1375
01:06:46,033 --> 01:06:46,965
All right.

1376
01:06:47,033 --> 01:06:48,660
Thanks for talking to me
like this, man.

1377
01:06:48,733 --> 01:06:50,564
You'd do the same thing for me,
you know?

1378
01:06:50,633 --> 01:06:53,830
No, l would have went behind your back
telling eveyone what a dick you were.

1379
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:55,594
Hey, lovebirds...

1380
01:06:55,666 --> 01:06:57,429
sory to interrupt your little date
over there...

1381
01:06:57,500 --> 01:06:59,695
but we're toasting Dirt.
Your shots are accumulating.

1382
01:06:59,766 --> 01:07:01,290
All right, all right, we're coming.

1383
01:07:01,366 --> 01:07:03,834
Not to much drinking. We got
a championship game in two hours.

1384
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:05,959
l know.
Let's just drink one toast to Dirt.

1385
01:07:06,166 --> 01:07:09,795
To the greatest rock and roll band
of all time...

1386
01:07:09,866 --> 01:07:11,390
Molly Hatchett.

1387
01:07:12,099 --> 01:07:13,158
Fucking all right.

1388
01:07:16,733 --> 01:07:17,665
Watch.

1389
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:20,664
I'm going to place this pe_ectly.

1390
01:07:27,766 --> 01:07:28,790
Asshole.

1391
01:07:29,033 --> 01:07:30,830
Ed, another round of tequila.

1392
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:35,769
You guys finished all my tequila.
Dave drank the last bottle by himself.

1393
01:07:36,066 --> 01:07:40,594
Last night l had a dream that l killed
evey single one of you guys.

1394
01:07:41,066 --> 01:07:42,465
Relax, Dave. Hey!

1395
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:45,164
Easy, Dave. Come on!

1396
01:07:45,766 --> 01:07:47,063
Hey, what time is it?

1397
01:07:47,266 --> 01:07:49,359
Holy shit, its almost game time.
We got to go.

1398
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:51,229
Eveybody got their bats and gloves
in their trunk, right?

1399
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:52,232
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1400
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:53,631
Yeah, just got to go home
and get my uniform.

1401
01:07:53,699 --> 01:07:55,292
-Yeah, me too.
-We ain't got time.

1402
01:07:55,366 --> 01:07:58,335
lf we're two seconds late, Manganelli's
going to call for a fo_eit.

1403
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:00,300
We got to go straight to the field.

1404
01:08:00,366 --> 01:08:03,665
-One more drink and then we'll go.
-No, no, we got to leave right now.

1405
01:08:03,733 --> 01:08:05,257
Come on.
You riding with me, Art?

1406
01:08:05,333 --> 01:08:06,925
Thanks, man.
Let's go, eveybody!

1407
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:07,932
Come on, let's go!

1408
01:08:09,333 --> 01:08:12,734
l can't let nine guys
drive out of here drunk.

1409
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:15,394
Well, I'm riding with Maz,
so it's really just eight.

1410
01:08:15,466 --> 01:08:18,026
-Come on, I'm fine.
-We do it evey weekend.

1411
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:20,193
l can't let you guys
drive out of here all shimmed up.

1412
01:08:20,266 --> 01:08:21,460
Jeez.

1413
01:08:21,533 --> 01:08:23,330
Well, then you have to drive
all of us.

1414
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:27,731
Open the door before l shove
that stupid fucking cooler up your ass.

1415
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:29,734
Get the fuck out!
Get the fuck out!

1416
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:32,234
What the fuck?
Let's move!

1417
01:08:32,633 --> 01:08:35,033
Man, both my legs are asleep.

1418
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:36,795
Both my balls are asleep.

1419
01:08:36,866 --> 01:08:38,493
l don't want to hear
about your balls.

1420
01:08:38,566 --> 01:08:39,897
Hail May, full of grace...

1421
01:08:39,966 --> 01:08:42,662
Don't pray like that, all right?
God hates Guidos.

1422
01:08:42,733 --> 01:08:43,927
Shit!

1423
01:08:45,333 --> 01:08:48,268
lt looks like the circus with all
the clowns coming out of the car.

1424
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:49,489
Where's Dave?

1425
01:08:49,566 --> 01:08:50,692
Did we forget Dave?

1426
01:08:52,233 --> 01:08:54,895
Anybody bring any weed?
l left mine at the funeral home.

1427
01:08:57,133 --> 01:08:58,259
Play ball!

1428
01:08:59,566 --> 01:09:00,533
Oh, Christ.

1429
01:09:02,433 --> 01:09:03,923
I'm going to fucking die out here.

1430
01:09:04,366 --> 01:09:05,663
I'm fucked up, bro.

1431
01:09:05,733 --> 01:09:06,791
Bourbon and tequila?

1432
01:09:07,033 --> 01:09:08,000
Come on, Art.

1433
01:09:08,366 --> 01:09:10,061
All right, let's look intelligent!

1434
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:11,692
Look alive.

1435
01:09:12,066 --> 01:09:13,590
Get ready to lose!

1436
01:09:13,666 --> 01:09:15,896
And here comes DeVanzo.

1437
01:09:16,166 --> 01:09:18,691
He's a sandy-haried,
slender-thighed...

1438
01:09:18,766 --> 01:09:21,496
long-legged,
big beautiful young man...

1439
01:09:21,566 --> 01:09:23,397
with excellent bone structure.

1440
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:25,665
The pussy he must get on the road.

1441
01:09:25,866 --> 01:09:26,890
Hey, look.

1442
01:09:27,033 --> 01:09:29,558
Drunk rookie pitcher on the mound.

1443
01:09:29,866 --> 01:09:31,493
We're going to destroy you.

1444
01:09:31,966 --> 01:09:33,627
You've never even pitched before.

1445
01:09:33,766 --> 01:09:37,065
No, but ifyou would do it,
it can't be that hard, bro.

1446
01:09:37,133 --> 01:09:38,157
Come on.

1447
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:41,560
DeVanzo wheels, deals,
rocks, kicks the up ring.

1448
01:09:47,699 --> 01:09:49,463
What the fuck are we doing here?

1449
01:09:49,666 --> 01:09:52,328
-You have done that before, haven't you?
-Shut up!

1450
01:09:52,399 --> 01:09:53,867
I'm still going to strike you out.

1451
01:09:53,933 --> 01:09:55,992
A_! A_!
Don't let him get to you.

1452
01:09:56,433 --> 01:09:57,627
Come on.

1453
01:09:58,866 --> 01:10:00,026
Well. Well.

1454
01:10:00,100 --> 01:10:01,192
Beautiful.

1455
01:10:05,566 --> 01:10:07,500
Ball four.
Take you base.

1456
01:10:07,566 --> 01:10:09,830
Yeah, l got a feeling
he will be saying that a lot today.

1457
01:10:11,066 --> 01:10:11,998
Come on, Art.

1458
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:16,030
Shit, it's going to be
a long game, bro.

1459
01:10:16,100 --> 01:10:18,034
All right, don't wory, don't wory.
He'll settle in.

1460
01:10:18,733 --> 01:10:20,132
Hey, Art.
Come on, Art.

1461
01:10:20,399 --> 01:10:22,231
Come on, Artie, focus.
Come on.

1462
01:10:28,266 --> 01:10:29,255
Yeah! Double play!

1463
01:10:29,333 --> 01:10:31,130
Yeah! Come on, Johnny.
Get it! Get it!

1464
01:10:33,166 --> 01:10:35,430
Shit! Shit!

1465
01:10:40,399 --> 01:10:42,493
This is the longest day
of your life, Artie.

1466
01:10:50,233 --> 01:10:51,632
Run! Run!

1467
01:10:57,366 --> 01:10:58,697
Home! Home!

1468
01:10:59,533 --> 01:11:00,830
Run, Dennis! Run!

1469
01:11:06,633 --> 01:11:07,998
Jeez!

1470
01:11:08,899 --> 01:11:10,128
Oh, God.

1471
01:11:12,033 --> 01:11:13,057
I'm good.

1472
01:11:14,866 --> 01:11:16,697
Come on, Dennis.
Come on, Dennis.

1473
01:11:19,199 --> 01:11:20,132
You're out!

1474
01:11:21,433 --> 01:11:22,991
And who's got a Percoset?

1475
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:25,865
All right, here we go!

1476
01:11:25,933 --> 01:11:28,959
All right. That's me, right at!

1477
01:11:31,366 --> 01:11:32,390
Fucking asshole.

1478
01:11:33,533 --> 01:11:34,693
You're out!

1479
01:11:34,766 --> 01:11:36,131
Ba_ly rules!

1480
01:11:37,266 --> 01:11:38,790
Come on, Bobby.
Place it.

1481
01:11:43,366 --> 01:11:44,458
Asshole.

1482
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,491
God, I'm glad Dirt
ain't around to see this.

1483
01:11:49,133 --> 01:11:50,157
You're out!

1484
01:11:50,233 --> 01:11:51,222
You're out!

1485
01:11:51,766 --> 01:11:52,790
You're out.

1486
01:11:56,866 --> 01:11:58,424
Thought the tank was empty.

1487
01:11:58,666 --> 01:12:00,133
-They keep doing this to themselves.
-l know. Here you go.

1488
01:12:00,199 --> 01:12:01,633
-Here you go, guys, coffee.
-Help yourselves.

1489
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:04,193
Thanks a lot.
Jimmy needed this.

1490
01:12:04,266 --> 01:12:05,358
Yeah, coffee.

1491
01:12:05,866 --> 01:12:07,231
-Hi, baby.
-Hey.

1492
01:12:08,333 --> 01:12:09,322
You smell like booze.

1493
01:12:09,399 --> 01:12:11,027
-lt gets you hot, though.
-Actually, it does.

1494
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:12,260
Thanks for the coffee, honey.

1495
01:12:12,333 --> 01:12:14,995
10-O. They're killing us.
Last at bat.

1496
01:12:15,066 --> 01:12:16,158
I'm sory.

1497
01:12:16,399 --> 01:12:17,890
-Hey, Gina.
-Hey, Artie.

1498
01:12:18,666 --> 01:12:20,725
I'm really sory about missing
your wedding.

1499
01:12:20,966 --> 01:12:22,399
Listen, don't wory about it.

1500
01:12:22,466 --> 01:12:24,957
You not showing up
was the best gift l got.

1501
01:12:25,033 --> 01:12:27,160
The only disaster
was Johnny's toast.

1502
01:12:27,466 --> 01:12:28,990
What?
He said it went great.

1503
01:12:29,266 --> 01:12:34,363
So to recap, throughout it all there's
been a lot of laughter and a few tears.

1504
01:12:34,433 --> 01:12:38,426
But in the end, the clouds parted,
the sun shined down...

1505
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:41,799
and the good Lord himself
decided it was meant to be.

1506
01:12:42,033 --> 01:12:45,867
That's how l finished
the regular season batting .706.

1507
01:12:46,166 --> 01:12:47,133
Salud.

1508
01:12:47,833 --> 01:12:48,993
What do we say, Dennis?

1509
01:12:49,066 --> 01:12:50,533
Come on, Dennis.
We're right behind you.

1510
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:52,032
Out.

1511
01:12:52,399 --> 01:12:55,130
Damn, now bourbon,
tequila and coffee.

1512
01:12:55,333 --> 01:12:56,425
Two away!

1513
01:12:57,533 --> 01:12:59,091
DeVanzo shift!

1514
01:13:01,333 --> 01:13:02,630
Well, you're down 10-O...

1515
01:13:02,699 --> 01:13:05,032
and you're going to make
your team's last out ever.

1516
01:13:05,266 --> 01:13:06,756
How's that feel, alcoholic?

1517
01:13:07,766 --> 01:13:11,258
Hury up and pitch, asshole.
I'm losing my buzz.

1518
01:13:12,233 --> 01:13:14,929
What do you say, Artie?
What do you say?

1519
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:15,967
Hey, Artie?

1520
01:13:16,033 --> 01:13:16,965
What?

1521
01:13:18,566 --> 01:13:19,590
Come here.

1522
01:13:20,266 --> 01:13:22,131
Hey, Linda.

1523
01:13:23,266 --> 01:13:27,168
Hey, sweetie.
How's it going? What's up?

1524
01:13:27,533 --> 01:13:29,160
Artie, you're a fucking ierk.

1525
01:13:29,233 --> 01:13:30,165
l know.

1526
01:13:30,233 --> 01:13:32,963
Unfortunately, that seems to be
my go-to move.

1527
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,524
But l really miss you.

1528
01:13:37,033 --> 01:13:38,432
l miss you too.

1529
01:13:39,533 --> 01:13:41,228
You want to talk after the game?

1530
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:43,666
Let's talk now
and make this jerk-offs wait.

1531
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:44,732
Hey, Linda?

1532
01:13:45,033 --> 01:13:47,501
I'll meet you in my office
at the gym after the game.

1533
01:13:47,866 --> 01:13:49,697
Shut the fuck up, Needle Dick!

1534
01:13:49,766 --> 01:13:51,131
And thanks for the herpes!

1535
01:13:53,833 --> 01:13:56,393
-Ball bag.
-What an asshole.

1536
01:13:56,466 --> 01:13:58,491
-Asshole.
-Jerk-off.

1537
01:13:58,566 --> 01:14:01,194
This town is 980/o skanks.

1538
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:04,762
That's my girl.

1539
01:14:05,733 --> 01:14:07,132
Let's go. Batter up!

1540
01:14:07,333 --> 01:14:09,301
-I'll see you after the game, all right?
-Okay.

1541
01:14:11,566 --> 01:14:12,658
Bye.

1542
01:14:12,733 --> 01:14:15,566
-Come on.
-Come on!

1543
01:14:15,633 --> 01:14:18,363
Get the fuck in, you lazy fuck.

1544
01:14:18,433 --> 01:14:19,991
Classy broad you got there, bro.

1545
01:14:20,433 --> 01:14:22,196
Thanks, Needle Dick.

1546
01:14:23,300 --> 01:14:25,598
Put it up there, Dennis.
He can't hit it.

1547
01:14:25,666 --> 01:14:28,260
-Come on.
-Here we go. Here we go.

1548
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:29,932
No.

1549
01:14:32,666 --> 01:14:34,463
-Yeah. Get out.
-Come on!

1550
01:14:36,266 --> 01:14:37,233
-Yeah!
-What?

1551
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:38,324
Fuck!

1552
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:40,432
Yeah!

1553
01:14:40,666 --> 01:14:41,792
Yeah!

1554
01:14:43,699 --> 01:14:45,065
Hell of a shot, bro!

1555
01:14:45,433 --> 01:14:49,426
Son of a bitch, mothe_ucker,
bastard, asshole!

1556
01:14:49,966 --> 01:14:51,024
Nice shot, Artie.

1557
01:14:51,266 --> 01:14:53,496
Hey, you assholes
knock that off...

1558
01:14:53,566 --> 01:14:55,659
or I'm revoking
your gym memberships!

1559
01:14:56,966 --> 01:14:58,433
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

1560
01:15:01,300 --> 01:15:02,597
Yeah!

1561
01:15:03,866 --> 01:15:05,356
Yeah!

1562
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:09,727
-Nice shot!
-That's right!

1563
01:15:09,966 --> 01:15:11,900
At least you got some revenge
on that prick Manganelli...

1564
01:15:11,966 --> 01:15:13,490
even if we're not going to win.

1565
01:15:13,566 --> 01:15:15,898
What the fuck are you talking about?
We're going to win.

1566
01:15:15,966 --> 01:15:18,264
Art, it's 10-1.
We're down to our last out.

1567
01:15:18,333 --> 01:15:19,265
l don't give a fuck.

1568
01:15:19,333 --> 01:15:21,767
Anyone who thinks we're going to lose
can go home right now!

1569
01:15:21,933 --> 01:15:23,195
Hey, calm down, will you?

1570
01:15:23,266 --> 01:15:24,995
Would Dirt calm down
if he were here?

1571
01:15:25,066 --> 01:15:27,694
No. After my homer he would have
thrown a bat at my head...

1572
01:15:27,766 --> 01:15:29,700
for not running
around the bases harder.

1573
01:15:29,766 --> 01:15:33,725
Now this is the last inning. Let's get
some runs and take that fucking troll!

1574
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:35,199
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

1575
01:15:40,933 --> 01:15:41,900
Come on now!

1576
01:15:44,533 --> 01:15:46,524
Nice! Nice going, Maz!

1577
01:15:47,066 --> 01:15:49,227
Run, you mothe_ucker!
Nice! Nice!

1578
01:15:53,899 --> 01:15:54,832
All right.

1579
01:15:56,166 --> 01:15:57,895
Come on, Dave.
What do you say?

1580
01:15:58,166 --> 01:16:01,033
Come on, Dave.
Let's go.

1581
01:16:01,100 --> 01:16:03,000
-Come on, bring it!
-Yeah, that's right.

1582
01:16:03,666 --> 01:16:05,099
Yeah! Yeah!

1583
01:16:05,166 --> 01:16:07,760
Holy shit, Dave got a hit.
Holy living Christ.

1584
01:16:13,633 --> 01:16:14,725
Lucky shot.

1585
01:16:15,100 --> 01:16:16,089

Come on!

1588
01:16:19,566 --> 01:16:21,193
-Shit!
-Cocksucker!

1589
01:16:22,100 --> 01:16:23,032
Damn!

1590
01:16:23,133 --> 01:16:24,691
Now we're looking like a team!

1591
01:16:25,933 --> 01:16:26,797
Yeah!

1592
01:16:28,633 --> 01:16:30,066
Stay on the bag, Dave.

1593
01:16:31,233 --> 01:16:33,701

Shit!

1599
01:16:49,666 --> 01:16:50,724
Asshole!

1600
01:16:50,899 --> 01:16:53,232
Yes! Get me a beer, somebody,
come on!

1601
01:16:53,833 --> 01:16:55,232
You're up, you're up, you're up.

1602
01:16:55,566 --> 01:16:57,227
Yeah! Yeah!

01:16:59,466 --> 01:17:00,455
What do you say, Dave?

1604

Nice! Like a gazelle, buddy!
Like a gazelle running out there.

1605
01:17:03,533 --> 01:17:05,398
What do you say, Alfonse?
Come on, one time!

Tim, get out there.
Come on, we need you, buddy.

1611
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:24,591
Run, run!

One time, Johnny.

1617
01:17:37,199 --> 01:17:39,327
Hey, Manganelli,
you're looking good, shitnuts.

1618
01:17:39,399 --> 01:17:41,766
We're rocking you,
you pansy ass.

1619
01:17:42,866 --> 01:17:44,128
lt's so unfair.

1620
01:17:44,199 --> 01:17:46,100
lt's like pitching
to a healthy Lou Gehrig.

1621
01:17:49,533 --> 01:17:50,465
Yeah!

1622
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:51,532
Fuck!

1623
01:17:53,533 --> 01:17:55,694
Let's go! Get it in here!

1624
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:05,067
DeVanzo shift.

1625
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:08,864
We're one out away
from the championship.

1626
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:10,727
Force at any base.

1627
01:18:11,766 --> 01:18:13,324
One more bum and they're done.

1628
01:18:13,399 --> 01:18:15,766
You pricks stay awake out there,
God damn it.

1629
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,662
Don't wory about the shift, Art.
We're down 10-6.

1630
01:18:18,733 --> 01:18:20,724
Just put it over the wall,
we tie it up. Let's go!

1631
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:22,825
Come on, Artie!
Give it a ride, brother. Come on!

1632
01:18:22,899 --> 01:18:24,891
Come on, big stick up there, Artie.
Let's go!

1633
01:18:24,966 --> 01:18:26,194
You can beat this guy.

1634
01:18:26,466 --> 01:18:27,433
He fucking blows.

1635
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:29,990
Your attention, please.

1636
01:18:30,433 --> 01:18:31,832
Ladies and gentlemen...

1637
01:18:32,266 --> 01:18:34,894
now pitching for Manganelli...

1638
01:18:34,966 --> 01:18:37,526
number one, Needle Dick.

1639
01:18:38,933 --> 01:18:40,958
-Number one.
-Yeah, all right.

1640
01:18:41,033 --> 01:18:42,193
Needle Dick.

1641
01:18:42,266 --> 01:18:45,099
Shut the fuck up!
Your luck's run out, DeVanzo.

1642
01:18:45,166 --> 01:18:47,726
This is your last at bat
in this league forever!

1643
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:49,927
I'm going to have to remodel
the window of my gym...

1644
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,560
to fit that fifth trophy,
but fuck it, right?

1645
01:18:52,633 --> 01:18:53,565
Let's go!

1646
01:18:53,633 --> 01:18:56,363
For the last time,
you're not getting that trophy.

1647
01:18:57,133 --> 01:18:59,101
Come on, hit it out, baby!

1648
01:18:59,333 --> 01:19:00,800
Come on, hit it out, fuckhead!

1649
01:19:01,399 --> 01:19:05,393
Prepare to continue you lifetime
Iosing streak, jerk-off.

1650
01:19:05,866 --> 01:19:06,992
Bring it on.

1651
01:19:07,066 --> 01:19:09,091
Stay cool, Artie.
Stay cool.

1652
01:19:09,333 --> 01:19:11,824
Let's go.

Hey, you all right?

1678
01:20:14,533 --> 01:20:15,830
Yeah, I'm all right.

1679
01:20:16,266 --> 01:20:17,426
lt was a hell of a game.

1680
01:20:17,666 --> 01:20:19,258
Good hustle.
Great shit.

1681
01:20:19,333 --> 01:20:21,699
Hey, guys,
this can't be our last game.

1682
01:20:21,766 --> 01:20:23,324
Let's go play in Parsippany

Let's go get drunk.

1689
01:20:34,300 --> 01:20:37,098
That sounds great, but there's
one thing l gotta do first.

1690
01:20:37,166 --> 01:20:39,259
Hey, Linda, pull the car around.

1691
01:20:39,333 --> 01:20:40,493
Okay, Artie.

1692
01:20:44,533 --> 01:20:45,625
My dear Lord.

-We did it!

1694

Absolutely.

1707
01:21:18,399 --> 01:21:20,868
God help DeVanzo

-Come back here, you little brat!

1712
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:37,535
Help! This maniac
is tying to give me fucking herpes.

1713
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:39,124
Come back here, you wise-ass.

You're such a pisser, Artie.

01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:48,734
What are you going to do
with that crazy thing?

1717
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:50,893
You know what?
Drive over Manganelli's gym.

1718
01:21:50,966 --> 01:21:53,264
I'll put a note on the trophy
saying I'm sory...

1719
01:21:53,333 --> 01:21:55,528
and then I'll throw it
through his front fucking window.

1720
01:21:55,899 --> 01:21:58,095
God, Artie,
please, don't do that.

1721
01:21:58,666 --> 01:21:59,894

1722
01:22:00,166 --> 01:22:01,463
Hey, let's pawn it in Newa_...

1723
01:22:01,533 --> 01:22:03,228

and get cheese sticks.

1724
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:05,468
-Count me in.

1729
01:22:37,133 --> 01:22:38,122
Wow!

1730
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:41,162
Those are really pretty
colo_ul shoes you got there.

1731
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:43,859
And they show off
your colo_ul nails.

1732
01:22:44,300 --> 01:22:45,289
Thanks.

1733
01:22:46,366 --> 01:22:47,526
Hey, do you like music?

1734
01:22:48,933 --> 01:22:50,366
Who doesn't like music?

1735
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,968
That's true.
Do you like rock music?

1736
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:54,694
l could take it or leave it.

1737
01:22:55,266 --> 01:22:57,564
Because my friend band,

1738
01:22:57,633 --> 01:22:59,032
and they're playing later.

What the fuck?
Get lost.

-Jesus.
-Jesus Christ.

1745
01:23:14,699 --> 01:23:17,260
I'm gone for like two minutes
and they're like vultures.

1746
01:23:17,333 --> 01:23:19,164
Two minutes?
You're gone for 20 minutes.

1747
01:23:19,233 --> 01:23:21,565
The line on the cheese steak
was like an hour long.

1748
01:23:21,633 --> 01:23:23,157
I'm sory.
You want a bite?

1749
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,524
-Have a bite. Come on.
-All right.

Batter to DeVanzo at first.
He's got it. Up with it.

1752
01:23:35,333 --> 01:23:37,528
Here. Down here.
Here. Here.

1753
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:39,397
Two. Deuce. One time.

1754
01:23:42,266 --> 01:23:43,824
That's nothing but fun there.

1755
01:23:44,333 --> 01:23:45,265
He's got it.

1756
01:23:49,866 --> 01:23:50,958

1760
01:24:05,066 --> 01:24:06,055
One time.

-Complete jerk-off.

1766
01:24:27,533 --> 01:24:29,467

1767
01:24:29,533 --> 01:24:31,000
-Shut the fuck up.
-Asshole.

1768
01:24:31,066 --> 01:24:32,624
This Danish is stale.

1769
01:24:34,399 --> 01:24:37,995
The happiest day of my life is
gonna be when you finally have a kid.

1770
01:24:38,399 --> 01:24:40,197
God bless, that means
l got laid at least once.

1771
01:24:50,166 --> 01:24:53,966
Laying down a bunt is like
holding your dick and putting it in.

1772
01:24:54,033 --> 01:24:55,500
Okay? Softly.

1773
01:24:58,933 --> 01:25:01,163
Hey, mom,

1774

-Mom!
-I'm looking!

1775
01:25:05,699 --> 01:25:10,069
Fluffernutter! See if we have any
Fluffernutter! She's losing her hearing.

1776
01:25:10,266 --> 01:25:11,824
I'm wory about her healthy.

1777
01:25:13,133 --> 01:25:15,567
You know, the happiest days...

1778

You were on ''Happy Days''?

1784
01:25:27,933 --> 01:25:30,094
-What's this line?
-Yep, yep, yep, yep.

1785
01:25:30,233 --> 01:25:31,200
Is that the line?

1786
01:25:31,266 --> 01:25:32,665
l have no idea.

1787
01:25:32,899 --> 01:25:34,765
That's the Jersey City salute?

1788
01:25:34,833 --> 01:25:38,496
That's the Jersey City salute
to Manganelli, sweetheart!

1789
