The reason you can't hear me...

160
00:12:16,636 --> 00:12:19,867
I must get my men near some broads
before they start freaking-out.

161
00:12:19,956 --> 00:12:22,629
I'm aware that,
that situation might be developing.

162
00:12:22,716 --> 00:12:24,946
Think I could get this in the hold of a B-17?

163
00:12:25,196 --> 00:12:27,471
We're point section
to the whole damn Army!

164
00:12:27,556 --> 00:12:29,308
Nancy's our town, Captain!

165
00:12:29,396 --> 00:12:32,274
MITCHELL: Babra says there's a company
of Germans pushing up.

166
00:12:32,356 --> 00:12:34,472
I'll be with you in a minute! Captain!

167
00:12:34,556 --> 00:12:36,786
We got it all figured out.
We even got a guide!

168
00:12:36,876 --> 00:12:40,949
- All we have to do is get in there!
- These German divisions say you can't.

169
00:12:41,196 --> 00:12:42,629
So we need a little help!

170
00:12:42,716 --> 00:12:44,832
All I need is to get this yacht out of here.

171
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:47,749
Get back to the barn.
I'll get the engineers and do it myself.

172
00:12:47,836 --> 00:12:50,145
You're supposed to be
in charge of this outfit!

173
00:12:50,516 --> 00:12:53,314
You're doing such a good job.
Why should I get in your way?

174
00:12:53,956 --> 00:12:55,355
Oh, God.

175
00:12:56,596 --> 00:12:57,631
JOB: Hey, Cowboy!

176
00:12:58,636 --> 00:13:02,868
There are three tanks coming up the road.
I suggest you get activated.

177
00:13:04,956 --> 00:13:09,074
Hold it down there a bit, Willard.
The Corporal's trying to tell us something.

178
00:13:09,156 --> 00:13:10,987
Yes, sir. You're telling me what?

179
00:13:11,076 --> 00:13:15,194
There are three tanks coming up the road.
I suggest you get activated!

180
00:13:15,516 --> 00:13:18,349
Now, come on, pal!
Ain't you got any Shermans?

181
00:13:18,436 --> 00:13:20,711
We've been polishing these things
for two days!

182
00:13:20,796 --> 00:13:23,754
If we take them out there in that rain,
they'll rust up on us.

183
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:25,189
JOB: Don't give me a hard time.

184
00:13:25,276 --> 00:13:27,028
Get off your ass, and get out there!

185
00:13:27,516 --> 00:13:29,586
Yes, sir. I didn't mean nothing!

186
00:13:29,756 --> 00:13:33,351
I was just trying to tell you
how we're feeling, ain't that right, Willy?

187
00:13:33,436 --> 00:13:37,270
LITTLE JOE: "Hold the ground at all costs?"
But we're a reconnaissance company!

188
00:13:37,356 --> 00:13:40,234
It's not our job to hold the ground!
That's an infantry's job!

189
00:13:40,316 --> 00:13:42,386
We're supposed to go out
and find someplace...

190
00:13:42,476 --> 00:13:45,388
...look at it and tell you
what the situation is.

191
00:13:45,476 --> 00:13:46,465
[Bomb blasts]

192
00:13:46,556 --> 00:13:49,434
I can tell you what the situation is!
It stinks!

193
00:13:49,556 --> 00:13:52,275
It's wet, it's cold,
and we're under heavy fire!

194
00:13:53,276 --> 00:13:54,868
Yes! Yes!

195
00:13:56,316 --> 00:13:58,272
JOB: Are they sending anything
to support us?

196
00:13:58,356 --> 00:14:01,632
They say they haven't got anything.
We've been ordered to hold.

197
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:04,435
JOB: Hold! With what?
LITTLE JOE: That's what I told them!

198
00:14:05,876 --> 00:14:08,868
You think we ought to pull out?

199
00:14:10,676 --> 00:14:13,190
I don't know. Better wait for Big Joe.

200
00:14:13,596 --> 00:14:17,589
Those are not Mulligan's mortars anymore.
Those are German 88s!

201
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:22,273
As much as I like Big Joe, I don't want
to spend the rest of the war in a camp.

202
00:14:22,396 --> 00:14:26,230
Besides which, I'm first-generation Italian,
they'd shoot me as a traitor.

203
00:14:26,316 --> 00:14:29,513
The indications are the Germans
are coming and we won't stop them.

204
00:14:29,596 --> 00:14:33,475
With your permission, I'll pull the vehicle
to the other side of the canal.

205
00:14:33,836 --> 00:14:35,474
[Bombs blast]

206
00:14:35,836 --> 00:14:37,064
[Sighs] Yeah, go on.

207
00:14:37,796 --> 00:14:40,105
JOB: Penn, Fisher! Get that damn thing
out of here!

208
00:14:40,196 --> 00:14:42,869
Okay, everybody!
We're pulling out on the double!

209
00:14:42,956 --> 00:14:43,593
[Blows whistle]

210
00:14:43,676 --> 00:14:44,870
Move that stretcher!

211
00:14:48,396 --> 00:14:50,034
God damn it, Cowboy!

212
00:14:50,396 --> 00:14:54,548
I don't know what you was talking about!
There ain't three tanks, there's about 20!

213
00:14:54,636 --> 00:14:56,308
- Ain't that right, Willy?
- Damn right.

214
00:14:56,476 --> 00:14:59,195
Get that thing to the other side
of the canal, you maniac!

215
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:02,228
Well, that's what we was figuring on doing.

216
00:15:07,436 --> 00:15:08,869
PENN: Kelly, come on, we're going!

217
00:15:08,956 --> 00:15:10,594
You're coming, ain't you?

218
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:11,706
Go on ahead.

219
00:15:11,996 --> 00:15:13,588
All right, good luck!

220
00:15:13,716 --> 00:15:15,434
Okay, Penn, let's go!

221
00:15:23,156 --> 00:15:25,511

[Bombs blast]

223
00:15:59,356 --> 00:16:00,345
Colonel.

224
00:16:12,356 --> 00:16:15,348
How many more bars of gold like this
do you have in that convoy?

225
00:16:16,236 --> 00:16:17,271
Vierzehn.

226
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,114
Come on, speak English, Colonel.

227
00:16:20,236 --> 00:16:22,192
How many bars like this in your trucks?

228
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:25,271
Fourteen.

229
00:16:25,676 --> 00:16:26,631
Fourteen what?

230
00:16:27,036 --> 00:16:27,991
Thousand.

231
00:16:30,716 --> 00:16:32,149
Fourteen thousand?

232
00:16:38,556 --> 00:16:40,194
Whereabouts is your convoy right now?

233
00:16:41,276 --> 00:16:43,073
Where are your trucks?

234
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:45,225
Clermont.

235
00:16:45,316 --> 00:16:47,227
In Clermont. Clermont?

236
00:16:47,516 --> 00:16:49,586
Is the gold still in the trucks?

237
00:16:51,516 --> 00:16:52,631
Nein!

238
00:16:54,436 --> 00:16:56,472
KELLY: Whereabouts?
Whereabouts is the gold?

239
00:16:57,316 --> 00:16:58,749
In the bank.

240
00:17:01,596 --> 00:17:04,793
Colonel? Wake up, wake up.
What about support units?

241
00:17:05,556 --> 00:17:06,545
Support?

242
00:17:06,716 --> 00:17:07,546
KELLY: Yeah, tanks.

243
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:10,713
Come on, tanks. Stuff like that.

244
00:17:12,396 --> 00:17:13,511
Tanks!

245
00:17:14,436 --> 00:17:16,666
Three Tiger tanks.

246
00:17:16,756 --> 00:17:18,428
What about infantry?

247
00:17:20,156 --> 00:17:22,351
What about infantry, Colonel?

248
00:17:34,476 --> 00:17:38,071
BIG JOE: Did you hear from headquarters?
LITTLE JOE: We've been ordered to hold.

249
00:17:38,156 --> 00:17:41,034
I'll tell them what to hold!
The Third took over one hour ago!

250
00:17:41,116 --> 00:17:42,788
- We're pulling out of here!
- Great!

251
00:17:42,876 --> 00:17:45,026
- Where's Maitland?
- He's salvaging a yacht.

252
00:17:45,116 --> 00:17:46,754
LITTLE JOE: A yacht?
BIG JOE: A yacht!

253
00:17:46,836 --> 00:17:48,428
I'll see you about 10 miles down the road.

254
00:17:48,516 --> 00:17:49,915
BIG JOE: Wait a minute!

255
00:17:50,076 --> 00:17:53,671
- Is everybody across the bridge?
- Kelly's in the barn with that Colonel.

256
00:17:53,756 --> 00:17:56,668
- Did you tell him we're pulling out?
- We told him. He's crazy!

257
00:17:57,396 --> 00:18:01,071
Tell Mulligan to give me three minutes
and lay all the mortar into that barn.

258
00:18:01,156 --> 00:18:01,952
BIG JOE: Do you understand?

259
00:18:02,036 --> 00:18:04,311
LITTLE JOE: If you say so.
BIG JOE: You wait here.

260
00:18:04,996 --> 00:18:06,111
LITTLE JOE: Mulligan!

261
00:18:07,556 --> 00:18:09,387
Come on, Colonel. Come on.

262
00:18:10,716 --> 00:18:12,672
Get up and sit right here.

263
00:18:23,876 --> 00:18:26,868
Kelly! Half the German Army's
coming up the road.

264
00:18:27,116 --> 00:18:30,188
In minutes, Mulligan will drop
10 tons of mortar on this joint!

265
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:32,949
BIG JOE: What are you doing?
KELLY: Looking after the Colonel.

266
00:18:33,036 --> 00:18:35,152
Shoot him and let's get the hell
out of here!

267
00:18:35,236 --> 00:18:37,033
Shoot him, we don't get the gold.

268
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:37,992
What gold?

269
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:41,307
KELLY: The gold that's in a bank
25 miles east of Nancy, that's what.

270
00:18:42,036 --> 00:18:45,790
Mulligan, I said three minutes!
Come on, let's get out of here!

271
00:19:09,716 --> 00:19:11,468
BIG JOE: Kelly? You okay, Kelly?

272
00:19:11,796 --> 00:19:12,945
KELLY: Yeah, I'm all right.

273
00:19:16,556 --> 00:19:19,195
BIG JOE: Come on, you nut!
Let's get the hell out of here!

00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:32,147
BIG JOE: Fisher! Petuko! Come on,
we're moving out! Move it out!

275
00:19:32,676 --> 00:19:35,668
Move it out! Babra! Come on! Move it!

Get in, we're pulling out!

Come on!

00:20:40,956 --> 00:20:43,265
Wait a minute, will you?
Will you wait a minute?

280
00:20:43,356 --> 00:20:46,314
Listen to me a second.
It's not me, I tell you. It's not me!

281
00:20:46,396 --> 00:20:49,194
I can't tell one shell from another!
They all look alike.

282
00:20:49,276 --> 00:20:50,504
They all look alike.

283
00:20:50,596 --> 00:20:53,156
If it was me...
If I could tell, would I be here?

284
00:20:53,236 --> 00:20:55,796
Would I be here? I wouldn't be here, Kelly!

285
00:20:55,876 --> 00:20:59,630
I'd be in the States checking out the duds.
I'd be out with all those broads!

286
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:01,707
MULLIGAN: I'd be working in a factory.
KELLY: Relax.

287
00:21:01,796 --> 00:21:05,027
Wait a minute! We've got to have
a little understanding around here.

288
00:21:05,116 --> 00:21:08,188
How the hell do we ever get
any understanding around here, Kelly?

289
00:21:08,276 --> 00:21:09,265
KELLY: Relax.

290
00:21:11,476 --> 00:21:13,751
Mulligan, I just want
to make you a proposition.

291
00:21:16,356 --> 00:21:17,311
A proposition?

292
00:21:22,636 --> 00:21:24,991
Well, is it dirty, or just illegal?

293
00:21:29,436 --> 00:21:31,586
I want you to set up a barrage for me.

294
00:21:32,796 --> 00:21:35,071
I want you to lay down a barrage for me.

right here at these crossroads.

I got to have a signed order from the C.O.

297
00:21:41,756 --> 00:21:43,428
I need an authorization.

298
00:21:43,556 --> 00:21:47,185
You see, that's just the problem, Mulligan.
We don't have an authorization.

299
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:49,069
MULLIGAN: You don't have a...

300
00:21:49,436 --> 00:21:52,155
Kelly, without an authorization,
I can't help you.

301
00:21:53,676 --> 00:21:57,271
I told you I had a proposition, Mulligan.
That's just what I meant.

302
00:21:58,076 --> 00:21:59,429
A proposition.

Well...

00:22:12,476 --> 00:22:13,272
Why?

Why what?

Why...

Why not?

310
00:22:23,036 --> 00:22:24,754
You won't forget me now, will you?

311

Why, no. I won't forget, Kelly.

to Paris by Sunday?

to talk about this boat again?

I made a deal with headquarters.
I have three days rest for you and the men.

362

I must get this yacht to Paris
and get some things for the General.

Right here, Sergeant.

you can fix this place up.

00:33:06,716 --> 00:33:11,346
These tanks are faster than any other tanks
in Europe. Forwards or backwards.

472
00:33:12,196 --> 00:33:16,155
We like to feel that we can get out
of trouble quicker than we got into it.

473
00:33:20,476 --> 00:33:21,875
Any other secret weapons?

474
00:33:22,596 --> 00:33:23,585
Oh, yeah.

475
00:33:23,956 --> 00:33:27,073
All the tanks we come up against
are bigger and better than ours.

476
00:33:27,156 --> 00:33:29,795
So that all we can hope to do
is like scare them away.

477
00:33:29,876 --> 00:33:32,071
This gun is an ordinary 76 millimeter...

478
00:33:32,156 --> 00:33:35,387
...but we added a piece of pipe onto it
and the Krauts think...

479
00:33:35,476 --> 00:33:36,989
...maybe it's a 90 millimeter.

480
00:33:37,396 --> 00:33:39,034
We got our own ammunition.

481
00:33:39,116 --> 00:33:43,428
It's filled with paint.
When we fire it, it makes pretty pictures.

482
00:33:43,516 --> 00:33:45,427
It scares the hell out of people.

483
00:33:47,796 --> 00:33:51,709
We got a loudspeaker. When we go
into battle, we play music very loud.

484
00:33:53,116 --> 00:33:54,390
It kind of...

485
00:33:54,756 --> 00:33:56,030
...calms us down.

486
00:34:05,596 --> 00:34:07,188
Come on inside for a minute.

487
00:34:13,276 --> 00:34:15,790
If I hear any more threats
against Maitland's life...

488
00:34:15,876 --> 00:34:19,312
...or wild talk about going to headquarters
and killing the General...

489
00:34:19,396 --> 00:34:23,833
...or raping the nurses at the field hospital,
I'll strangle the guy with my bare hands!

490
00:34:23,916 --> 00:34:26,066
All good things come to those who wait!

491
00:34:26,876 --> 00:34:29,754
We're gonna have a lot of fun here!
Aren't we, Cowboy?

492
00:34:29,836 --> 00:34:32,634
- You can bet your boots on that, partner.
- Sergeant, partner!

493
00:34:32,716 --> 00:34:33,865
Right, Sarge.

494
00:34:35,196 --> 00:34:37,107
I think I've got the crabs.

495
00:34:38,036 --> 00:34:41,108
We'll boil our laundry!
We'll set up a little shower area...

496
00:34:41,196 --> 00:34:43,664
...so we can wash our cute little bodies.
Right, Barbara?

497
00:34:43,756 --> 00:34:45,155
- Babra, sir...
- Shut up!

498
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:46,705
Shave!

499
00:34:46,796 --> 00:34:49,833
A little wine, women and song.
A little chiquita for you, Petuko.

500
00:34:49,916 --> 00:34:53,829
It'll take time to get organized, but I want
that farmhouse to look like a nightclub!

501
00:34:53,916 --> 00:34:54,871
Little Joe!

502
00:34:54,956 --> 00:34:56,435
I want you to set up a bar!

503
00:34:56,516 --> 00:34:57,915
We ain't got no booze.

504
00:34:58,076 --> 00:35:01,432
"We ain't got no booze."
Well, we're going to get some booze!

505
00:35:01,676 --> 00:35:03,507
I'm going to go down to the battalion...

506
00:35:03,596 --> 00:35:07,111
...see if I can lay my hands on
some dirty movies and when I come back...

507
00:35:07,676 --> 00:35:11,271
...I want that farmhouse not only clean,
but completely decorated!

508
00:35:11,356 --> 00:35:12,630
Do you understand that?

509
00:35:12,756 --> 00:35:15,475
All right, Corporal, fall them out!
Let's get moving.

510
00:35:18,796 --> 00:35:20,309
Sixteen million.

511
00:35:23,556 --> 00:35:24,750
Sixteen million.

512
00:35:25,516 --> 00:35:27,586
Kelly, I think I made a slight mistake.

513
00:35:27,676 --> 00:35:30,793
It's not $1.6 million, it's $16 million!

514
00:35:31,076 --> 00:35:32,111
What a bundle!

515
00:35:32,876 --> 00:35:35,026
We'll need plenty of gasoline on this trip.

516
00:35:35,276 --> 00:35:37,471
Think you can get it through enemy lines?

517
00:35:37,556 --> 00:35:39,512
Just name the place, baby.

518
00:35:41,916 --> 00:35:44,066
Right here. Grid section B.

519
00:35:44,156 --> 00:35:45,669
Tonight at 21:00.

520
00:35:45,756 --> 00:35:48,873
No good, man. The boys have got
something special on tonight.

521
00:35:49,116 --> 00:35:51,835
Are you nuts?
What's more important than $16 million?

522
00:35:52,076 --> 00:35:55,466
You come around tonight, Crapgame,
and we'll show you.

523
00:35:55,996 --> 00:35:56,906
Okay.

524
00:35:57,796 --> 00:36:00,310
Tomorrow night, then.
Along this road, same hour.

525
00:36:00,516 --> 00:36:01,949
We'll be there.

526
00:36:02,396 --> 00:36:06,548
- lf you're late, we move out without you.
- lf we're late, it's because we're dead.

527
00:36:06,636 --> 00:36:07,830
CRAPGAME: What about Big Joe?

528
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:10,066
You handle the supplies,
I'll take care of him.

529
00:36:10,156 --> 00:36:12,954
CRAPGAME: Not only that, but I'm
going along to protect my investment.

530
00:36:13,036 --> 00:36:14,025
KELLY: You don't trust me.

531
00:36:14,116 --> 00:36:17,153
A firm financial mind should be behind
an enterprise such as this.

532
00:36:17,236 --> 00:36:20,706
There could be a bonus. Besides,
Switzerland's only 100 miles away.

533
00:36:21,116 --> 00:36:23,391
I don't want anybody getting lost.

534
00:36:24,316 --> 00:36:26,955
I don't want half the Army in on this deal.

535
00:36:27,036 --> 00:36:30,631
No friends or friends of friends.
I want to keep it a tight little unit.

536
00:36:31,036 --> 00:36:32,469
Right, Oddball?

537
00:36:33,476 --> 00:36:34,795
Oh, yeah, man.

538
00:36:35,836 --> 00:36:36,985
No sweat, you know?

539
00:36:40,196 --> 00:36:42,551
I'll pick you up in about an hour.

540
00:36:42,756 --> 00:36:45,395
You can hang onto that bar of gold
as a deposit.

541
00:36:49,316 --> 00:36:50,874
Who is that guy, Crapgame?

542
00:36:51,356 --> 00:36:53,472
His name's Kelly. Used to be a lieutenant.

543
00:36:53,876 --> 00:36:56,868
Pretty good, too, until he was ordered
to attack the wrong hill.

544
00:36:56,956 --> 00:36:58,708
Wiped out half a company of G.I.'s.

545
00:36:58,996 --> 00:37:01,669
Somebody had to get the blame,
and he got picked.

546
00:37:01,796 --> 00:37:03,434
[Nervous laughter]

547
00:37:03,876 --> 00:37:05,992
ODDBALL: Oh, man, I don't like officers.

548
00:37:11,236 --> 00:37:13,192
Neither does he, so relax.

549
00:37:18,636 --> 00:37:20,308
Get me Hogan in Intelligence.

550
00:37:22,036 --> 00:37:23,025
Hey, Crapgame.

551
00:37:25,276 --> 00:37:28,268
Do you mind if I take this bar of gold
and show it to the boys?

552
00:37:28,556 --> 00:37:31,946
No, not at all. Just remember
where you found it. Bring it back here.

553
00:37:33,676 --> 00:37:35,792
You're a good boy, Crapgame.

554
00:37:36,596 --> 00:37:38,632
Something's wrong with him.

555
00:37:39,276 --> 00:37:41,153
Hello, Hogan? It's Crapgame.

556
00:37:42,276 --> 00:37:44,744
I got you the scotch
and the nylons you wanted.

557
00:37:46,876 --> 00:37:48,195
Do I ever fail you?

558
00:37:48,636 --> 00:37:50,672
You better believe it. Never miss.

559
00:37:51,876 --> 00:37:52,945
Listen...

560
00:37:53,676 --> 00:37:56,144
...I got a little favor to ask of you.

561
00:37:58,796 --> 00:38:01,754
Will you stop crying,
I haven't even asked you yet!

562
00:38:02,476 --> 00:38:04,068
What's the matter with you?

563
00:38:23,396 --> 00:38:25,114
You wait here, Padre.

564
00:38:35,476 --> 00:38:38,149
I warned you, if you started anything,
I'd bust you out.

565
00:38:40,956 --> 00:38:42,833
If you transfer me, Joe...

566
00:38:43,196 --> 00:38:45,505
...you have to transfer every man
in this outfit.

567
00:38:45,596 --> 00:38:47,393
I told you to lay off these guys!

568
00:38:47,476 --> 00:38:51,355
- Take it easy. He's got it all figured out.
- Who invited you, Hustler?

569
00:38:51,836 --> 00:38:52,871
He did.

570
00:38:52,956 --> 00:38:53,945
TURK: Hey, Joe.

571
00:38:54,676 --> 00:38:58,749
It's a snap.
$16 million just waiting to be picked up.

572
00:38:59,156 --> 00:39:01,590
Did he forget to tell you
it's behind enemy lines?

573
00:39:01,676 --> 00:39:02,586
I told them.

574
00:39:02,716 --> 00:39:03,466
BIG JOE: Yeah?

575
00:39:03,556 --> 00:39:06,946
Did you tell them how to get through
and cover 30 miles to Clermont?

576
00:39:07,036 --> 00:39:08,628
- I told them.
- Then tell me!

577
00:39:08,716 --> 00:39:12,311
- Kelly's got it figured pretty good.
- Listen, crap! He'll get you all killed!

578
00:39:12,396 --> 00:39:14,864
COWBOY: We're getting killed now, pal,
for $50 a month.

579
00:39:14,956 --> 00:39:15,786
Damn right.

580
00:39:15,876 --> 00:39:17,832
What good is a bonus when you're dead?

581
00:39:17,916 --> 00:39:20,988
The risk is the same one we've been taking
since we hit the beaches.

582
00:39:21,076 --> 00:39:23,271
Only then you didn't have a choice,
now you do!

583
00:39:23,356 --> 00:39:25,790
Three days from now we're going back
into the line.

584
00:39:25,956 --> 00:39:28,106
But this time we're doing it for ourselves.

585
00:39:28,796 --> 00:39:31,264
Kelly's even got us armor support.

586
00:39:32,756 --> 00:39:33,905
BIG JOE: What armor?

587
00:39:34,076 --> 00:39:36,385
CRAPGAME: Three Shermans
from the 321st.

588
00:39:36,476 --> 00:39:37,545
Who's in command?

589
00:39:37,636 --> 00:39:40,070
It's a top-line outfit!
I personally recommend them!

590
00:39:40,156 --> 00:39:44,593
You butt out! The only time you come out
of the ground is when you smell a profit.

591
00:39:44,676 --> 00:39:47,190
I'm coming out now
because Kelly has the perfect caper!

592
00:39:47,276 --> 00:39:50,586
For you it's a vacation. Six days
out of seven you're behind the lines.

593
00:39:50,676 --> 00:39:53,827
We're at the broken end of a bottle
all the time, so you butt out!

594
00:39:57,196 --> 00:39:58,629
Who's in command?

595
00:39:59,316 --> 00:40:00,431
Guy named Oddball.

596
00:40:00,516 --> 00:40:01,869
Oddball! He's a freak!

597
00:40:01,956 --> 00:40:03,912
He's got three Shermans all ready to go.

598
00:40:03,996 --> 00:40:06,715
What guarantee is that?
He's ready to go? He's a nut.

599
00:40:06,956 --> 00:40:09,345
We're all nuts or we wouldn't be here.

600
00:40:11,156 --> 00:40:14,068
Hey, look. Let me tell you guys something.

601
00:40:14,836 --> 00:40:18,146
There's certain rules and regulations
governing the fighting of a war.

602
00:40:18,236 --> 00:40:22,149
And the first one is that
you never stick your neck out for nobody!

603
00:40:22,236 --> 00:40:24,466
Unless you're some kind of a hero type.

604
00:40:24,556 --> 00:40:27,195
And I haven't seen any hero types
around here lately.

605
00:40:27,276 --> 00:40:29,312
KELLY: Talking's not going to do
any good, Joe.

606
00:40:31,196 --> 00:40:33,107
These men are all going.

607
00:40:35,356 --> 00:40:36,471
Who will lead them?

608
00:40:39,516 --> 00:40:41,234
If you don't, I will.

609
00:40:50,276 --> 00:40:54,110
Just listen to Kelly for a minute, Joe.
He's got it all sewed, man.

610
00:40:54,236 --> 00:40:57,353
The route, the timing,
the supplies, everything.

611
00:40:58,716 --> 00:40:59,671
Sure.

612
00:41:04,156 --> 00:41:05,145
Sure.

613
00:41:21,636 --> 00:41:23,035
What do you say, Corporal?

614
00:41:25,556 --> 00:41:26,955
I don't know, Joe.

615
00:41:27,516 --> 00:41:31,225
I figure if I got to go, it might just as well
be this trip as the next one.

616
00:41:36,836 --> 00:41:37,746
Penn?

617
00:41:38,396 --> 00:41:39,670
I'm for it.

618
00:41:52,236 --> 00:41:53,430
How about it, Cowboy?

619
00:41:53,916 --> 00:41:56,669
I reckon I'm going to have to go along
with it, Joe.

620
00:41:59,316 --> 00:42:00,544
They're all for it.

621
00:42:04,756 --> 00:42:07,190
What happens when Maitland finds out
we're not here?

622
00:42:07,676 --> 00:42:10,236
He'll figure we've been sent back
to the front lines.

623
00:42:10,476 --> 00:42:12,785
LITTLE JOE: Man, he never knows

Okay, show me what you've got.

trees. Let me look at that map, will you?

626
00:42:44,116 --> 00:42:46,107
What if they've put up road blocks?

627

KELLY: Doesn't matter. All that matters is
Mulligan being on time.

628
00:42:49,356 --> 00:42:52,189
Mulligan is on time!
On time and on target!

He ain't ever been that yet!

KELLY: Yeah, I got the time straight
with Mulligan.

Whether Mulligan can tell time or not
is another question.

in that town.

It's not big enough for a garrison.

How did you figure 30 or 40 men?

of support for three Tiger tanks.

Where did the Tigers come from?

772

That's why we have Oddball

00:54:49,276 --> 00:54:52,951
He may be nuts, but he's not crazy enough
to put Shermans up against Tigers!

778

Once these things get rolling, they'll blow
that whole town to pieces, including us!

You're too smart to let that happen, Joe.

780
00:55:00,316 --> 00:55:02,625
You'll figure us a way in and out
of that town.

1092
01:24:48,494 --> 01:24:50,166
It has to do with the ionosphere.

1093
01:24:50,254 --> 01:24:53,166
Get the ionosphere the hell off the air
and get them on!

1094
01:24:53,254 --> 01:24:55,643
Get out of there, soldier.
Do something else.

1095
01:24:55,734 --> 01:24:58,248
- What's the frequency?
- 300 kc, sir.

1096
01:24:58,334 --> 01:25:02,373
You won't find them easy to follow.
They're using some kind of code.

1097
01:25:03,094 --> 01:25:03,890
What code?

1098
01:25:03,974 --> 01:25:06,204
Words like "bank heist,
Crapgame, Big Joe...

1099
01:25:06,294 --> 01:25:07,727
"...Little Joe, Oddball..."

1100
01:25:07,854 --> 01:25:10,448
CRAPGAME: Can anybody get rid of
that machine gun for me?

1101
01:25:10,534 --> 01:25:13,094
- Yes, sir, there! That's it, that's them!
- Where?

1102
01:25:13,174 --> 01:25:15,529
There! Right on 300, sir. Right there.

1103
01:25:16,774 --> 01:25:20,005
There they are, sir. Those are the signals
we've been picking up.

1104
01:25:20,094 --> 01:25:23,291
Will you shut up and let me try and listen
to what they're saying?

1105
01:25:25,214 --> 01:25:26,852
KELLY: Oddball, this is Kelly.

1106
01:25:26,934 --> 01:25:29,812
ODDBALL: Kelly, what the hell's going on
out there, man?

1107
01:25:29,894 --> 01:25:33,648
KELLY: It's cleared of infantry. What do
you hear from those other two tanks?

1108
01:25:34,134 --> 01:25:38,093
No chance, man. They've both had it.
One's in the river, the other's burning.

1109
01:25:38,934 --> 01:25:40,811
Yeah, I can see them from here. Over.

1110
01:25:42,454 --> 01:25:43,523
Where's Big Joe?

1111
01:25:43,814 --> 01:25:47,250
KELLY: On the other side. Get off the line,
I'll get in touch with him.

1112
01:25:47,334 --> 01:25:48,289
Fire!

1113
01:25:48,974 --> 01:25:50,123
Okay. Over and out.

1114
01:25:50,934 --> 01:25:53,812
KELLY: Kelly to Big Joe.
Kelly to Big Joe. Over.

1115
01:25:53,894 --> 01:25:56,852
CRAPGAME: Kelly, it's Crapgame.
What's happening over there?

1116
01:25:57,134 --> 01:26:00,410
They're dropping artillery
all over the place! That's what.

1117
01:26:00,534 --> 01:26:01,683
Where's Big Joe?

1118
01:26:02,134 --> 01:26:04,523
He's not here. He's pinned down
under the bridge.

1119
01:26:05,054 --> 01:26:06,851
Well, get him for me! Over.

1120
01:26:07,414 --> 01:26:10,645
Damn! Are we losing them?
We just had them good a minute ago!

1121
01:26:10,734 --> 01:26:12,406
I'm doing it, Booker!

1122
01:26:13,334 --> 01:26:14,289
Quiet!

1123
01:26:14,374 --> 01:26:16,046
What should I do with this?

1124
01:26:16,134 --> 01:26:18,773
Get the hell out of here!
We've got the game on!

1125
01:26:29,894 --> 01:26:31,373
BIG JOE: Kelly, this is Big Joe.

1126
01:26:31,734 --> 01:26:34,373
It's pretty clear over here,
except for the artillery.

1127
01:26:34,454 --> 01:26:38,049
The bridge is too far gone for vehicles.
You can bring the men over by foot.

1128
01:26:38,494 --> 01:26:40,212
Get them moving.

1129
01:26:40,534 --> 01:26:43,367
Okay, I'll send them over
in twos and threes. Out.

1130
01:26:43,734 --> 01:26:47,204
Drop your packs and take the equipment
across the bridge.

1131
01:26:49,534 --> 01:26:51,729
Kelly, what did Big Joe say?

1132
01:26:52,854 --> 01:26:54,412
Says he's sending them across.

1133
01:26:54,774 --> 01:26:57,652
Tell him to hurry up.
It's getting hotter than hell in here!

1134
01:27:00,814 --> 01:27:02,725
- What's going on?
- We're crossing over.

1135
01:27:02,814 --> 01:27:06,363
- You're not crossing over without us!
- Then grab your trucks and come on up.

1136
01:27:06,454 --> 01:27:08,126
The bridge is too badly damaged.

1137
01:27:08,214 --> 01:27:09,567
You want to come, fix it.

1138
01:27:09,694 --> 01:27:11,844
Half my equipment's jammed up
in the rear!

1139
01:27:11,934 --> 01:27:13,253
Un-jam them!

1140
01:27:13,334 --> 01:27:16,451
We've lost two tanks already!
I won't stick around to lose a third!

1141
01:27:16,534 --> 01:27:18,013
Listen, we made a deal!

1142
01:27:18,094 --> 01:27:20,608
Not with me, you didn't.
Here! You talk to Kelly.

1143
01:27:20,694 --> 01:27:22,093
BIG JOE: Cowboy, stay with the truck.

1144
01:27:22,174 --> 01:27:23,004
Ready?

1145
01:27:23,734 --> 01:27:25,531
This is Bellamy for Kelly!

1146
01:27:26,614 --> 01:27:29,526
We can't use the bridge.
We can't ford the river.

1147
01:27:29,614 --> 01:27:30,603
So what do we do?

1148
01:27:30,694 --> 01:27:31,968
Go team go. Go!

1149
01:27:32,054 --> 01:27:34,124
KELLY: You've got bridging equipment.
Over.

1150
01:27:34,214 --> 01:27:38,093
That's a five-hour operation.
Can you hold on for five hours? Over.

1151
01:27:38,174 --> 01:27:40,369
No, no! Move! On, on! Move!

1152
01:27:40,694 --> 01:27:43,891
We're not going to hold on
for five minutes. You can catch up.

1153
01:27:44,174 --> 01:27:47,689
Kelly, we're all in this together.
You can't go it alone! Over!

1154
01:27:47,934 --> 01:27:51,893
We're not gonna wait five hours, either.
If you can't keep up, that's your problem.

1155
01:27:51,974 --> 01:27:54,613
We're pulling out
and we're pushing forward! Over!

1156
01:27:54,694 --> 01:27:56,127
Attack! Attack!

1157
01:27:56,294 --> 01:27:59,730
That's the fighting spirit
I was talking about! Listen to that guy!

1158
01:27:59,814 --> 01:28:01,725
If he was a major, he's a colonel now!

1159
01:28:01,854 --> 01:28:06,291
MAN: This is Grave Diggers Registration
Unit. We got a stake in this advance, too.

1160
01:28:06,374 --> 01:28:08,968
Did you ever hear enthusiasm
like that in all your life?

1161
01:28:09,054 --> 01:28:12,967
They've even got the damn Grave Diggers!
What the hell am I doing here?

1162
01:28:13,054 --> 01:28:15,727
Bonsor! Get me my uniform!

1163
01:28:16,214 --> 01:28:18,045
ODDBALL: Get on!
MAN: I wonder where Cowboy is?

1164
01:28:18,134 --> 01:28:19,453
MAN 2: Give me that gun!

1165
01:28:19,934 --> 01:28:21,253
MAN 3: Pick up that radio!

1166
01:28:21,814 --> 01:28:22,963
LITTLE JOE: Faster, faster!

1167
01:28:23,694 --> 01:28:25,764
Hurry up, you guys!
We haven't got much time!

1168
01:28:25,854 --> 01:28:26,684
ODDBALL: Get up!

1169
01:28:26,774 --> 01:28:28,526
MAN 4: Crapgame, do you like the Army?

1170
01:28:29,054 --> 01:28:31,170
ODDBALL: Let's go! Let's get out of here!

1171
01:28:32,334 --> 01:28:33,926
All right, let's move them out!

1172
01:28:36,214 --> 01:28:39,604
- This is it, Penn. We're on our way, baby.
- Cowboy, come on! Hurry up!

1173
01:28:39,894 --> 01:28:40,849
Here we go!

1174
01:28:42,094 --> 01:28:44,050
MAN: Come on, Cowboy!
This train's leaving.

1175
01:28:44,134 --> 01:28:45,328
Give me your hand.

1176
01:28:45,654 --> 01:28:47,565
MAN 2: Somebody grab that radio.

1177
01:28:48,414 --> 01:28:50,609
MAN 1: There you go! Come on, up, up!

1178
01:28:51,734 --> 01:28:53,167
That a boy, come on!

1179
01:28:54,534 --> 01:28:55,523
That's it.

1180
01:29:01,014 --> 01:29:04,370
Booker, tell General Castle
that I want every man in this Army...

1181
01:29:04,454 --> 01:29:06,046
...on the road within the hour.

1182
01:29:06,574 --> 01:29:08,007
I'm pushing on to the Rhine.

1183
01:29:08,254 --> 01:29:10,848
But, sir, Clermont's 30 miles
behind enemy lines.

1184
01:29:11,094 --> 01:29:12,209
That you, Maitland?

1185
01:29:13,334 --> 01:29:14,653
Just back from Paris, sir.

1186
01:29:14,814 --> 01:29:16,691
Get my vehicle and driver around here.

1187
01:29:16,774 --> 01:29:18,651
You get my box of medals.

1188
01:29:18,774 --> 01:29:21,811
I'll decorate every man in this penetration,
whoever they are.

1189
01:29:21,894 --> 01:29:24,203
They've saved the reputation
of this entire Army.

1190
01:29:24,294 --> 01:29:27,650
You're supposed to fight this battle.
You don't even know where it is!

1191
01:29:27,734 --> 01:29:31,090
I'll tell you where it is! It's 30 miles
beyond where you thought!

1192
01:29:32,174 --> 01:29:34,893
Come on, let's get this Army of mine
back in the war!

1193
01:29:34,974 --> 01:29:36,202
BOOKER: Will you send that?

1194
01:29:45,134 --> 01:29:47,853
[Theme song, Burning Bridges plays]

1195
01:30:26,774 --> 01:30:29,049
Shouldn't you wait for the Army
to get ahead of you?

1196
01:30:29,134 --> 01:30:30,613
History waits for no man.

1197
01:30:30,694 --> 01:30:32,924
I have an appointment with destiny
in Clermont.

1198
01:30:33,014 --> 01:30:34,493
Take this weapon, Maitland.

1199
01:30:34,574 --> 01:30:36,485
All right, boy! Make this thing fly.

1200
01:30:36,614 --> 01:30:38,764
- General, your medals.
- Good luck, sir.

1201
01:30:46,894 --> 01:30:48,885
[Piano music plays faintly]

1202
01:31:19,174 --> 01:31:20,163
Kelly?

1203
01:31:21,334 --> 01:31:23,245
We're in the bell tower of the church.

1204
01:31:23,654 --> 01:31:26,532
You can see the whole town
from up here, almost.

1205
01:31:26,614 --> 01:31:29,003
There's not much happening.
They're still asleep.

1206
01:31:29,494 --> 01:31:32,850
COWBOY: [Over radio] There's three Tigers
in the square right down below us.

1207
01:31:33,614 --> 01:31:36,492
Do you see anything
that looks like it might be a bank?

1208
01:31:36,574 --> 01:31:39,725
COWBOY: It's got to be this building
right here to the right of us.

1209
01:31:39,814 --> 01:31:41,293
Can you see it from where you are?

1210
01:31:41,374 --> 01:31:43,729
They've got two machine guns
and guards on the roof.

1211
01:31:45,494 --> 01:31:49,487
KELLY: I don't think I can see much
of the center of town from up here.

1212
01:31:50,614 --> 01:31:54,493
No, just a lot of rooftops
and bombed out buildings.

1213
01:31:57,774 --> 01:32:01,005
Beside the tanks, can you see anything
that might house support units?

1214
01:32:01,734 --> 01:32:05,283
There's a big brown building
right behind the bank with a jeep...

1215
01:32:05,654 --> 01:32:08,168
...and two guards and about three trucks.

1216
01:32:09,014 --> 01:32:10,083
Hold it!

1217
01:32:14,814 --> 01:32:19,171
There's a German officer walking around
the bank towards the brown building.

1218
01:32:19,534 --> 01:32:20,603
KELLY: What do you think?

1219
01:32:20,694 --> 01:32:23,527
COWBOY: We shouldn't have trouble
unless it's with the Tigers.

1220
01:32:23,614 --> 01:32:26,128
We can take the machine gunners
on the roof from here...

1221
01:32:26,214 --> 01:32:28,011
...if you can keep them busy for a while.

1222
01:32:28,094 --> 01:32:30,688
Or maybe we can go down
and get a closer look.

1223
01:32:30,774 --> 01:32:32,446
KELLY: No, stay there. Keep an eye out.

1224
01:32:32,534 --> 01:32:35,253
See if you can find out
where those troops are housed.

1225
01:32:37,014 --> 01:32:38,686
What do you think, Oddball?

1226
01:32:38,774 --> 01:32:42,733
ODDBALL: It's a wasted trip. Nobody said
anything about locking horns with Tigers.

1227
01:32:42,814 --> 01:32:46,568
BIG JOE: Look. You just keep those Tigers
busy, and we'll take care of the rest.

1228
01:32:46,814 --> 01:32:50,727
The only way I got to keep the Tigers busy
is to let them shoot holes in me.

1229
01:32:51,454 --> 01:32:53,968
We just want you to keep them interested
for a while.

Oh, man! You guys are crazy!

1231
01:32:56,734 --> 01:32:59,806
When we was in the bocage country,
we was assaulted by them Tigers!

1232

You know what I mean by "assaulted"?
Well, I mean assaulted!

1233

Why don't you knock it off
with them negative waves?

Why don't you dig
how beautiful it is out here?

Why don't you say something righteous
and hopeful for a change?

Now, let's get down to cases.

You're a hell of a soldier,
I just want to shake your hand.

from that Tiger.

Oddball, I can't make it work without
the parts no matter how positive I think!

1423
02:01:41,534 --> 02:01:45,971
This guy in the Tiger, the least we could do
is get him on the radio and talk to him.

ODDBALL: Are you crazy?

1425

He must be a full, fanatic freak!
Or he would've split 20 minutes ago.

1426
02:01:52,214 --> 02:01:55,604
All this guy is doing,
is guarding the bank like he was told.

1427

Yeah, maybe.

1428

No smoke.

We have gasoline all over the place.

Hey, look, Max...

You and us, we're just soldiers, right?

1435
02:05:13,614 --> 02:05:15,764
We don't even know
what this war's all about.

1436
02:05:15,974 --> 02:05:18,534
All we do is we fight and we die.
And for what?

02:05:18,614 --> 02:05:20,525
We don't get anything out of it.

In about half an hour, the American Army's
going to be coming down that road.

and get the hell out of here?

This bank isn't to fall in the hands
of the American Army.

This bank's not gonna fall into the hands
of the American Army, but in our hands.

You know what's inside that bank, man?

There's $16 million worth of gold
in that bank, sweetheart.

That's about 65 million marks.
