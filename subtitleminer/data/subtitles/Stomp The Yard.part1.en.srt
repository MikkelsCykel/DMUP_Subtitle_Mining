1
00:01:19,717 --> 00:01:21,776
Yo, we should just play this
straight up.

2
00:01:21,952 --> 00:01:24,443
Those cats will fold under pressure.

3
00:01:25,256 --> 00:01:27,588
We can take these fools
with our eyes closed. Come on.

4
00:01:27,758 --> 00:01:30,750
No doubt, but I don't wanna diss them
in front of their home crowd.

5
00:01:30,928 --> 00:01:33,863
D, I got you.

6
00:01:34,565 --> 00:01:35,793
I got y'all.

7
00:01:44,942 --> 00:01:47,911
-All right, man.
-Come on, let's do it.

8
00:02:08,432 --> 00:02:11,060
All right, all right, y'all, that was hot!

9
00:02:11,235 --> 00:02:12,759
And the winner is....

10
00:02:13,337 --> 00:02:15,635
Sphere and the Thug Unit!

11
00:02:16,874 --> 00:02:19,172
Who wants next?

12
00:02:21,612 --> 00:02:23,580
Let's get it going on in here.

13
00:02:23,747 --> 00:02:25,442
-Y'all want some of this?
-We got next.

14
00:02:32,289 --> 00:02:33,586
Let's go.

15
00:02:33,757 --> 00:02:36,954
All right, all right, y'all, let's get
it popping in this mall!

16
00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:48,294
You haven't seen him pop.
Come on, come on.

17
00:04:15,526 --> 00:04:17,016
-Hey, got that.
-Get out of here!

18
00:04:17,528 --> 00:04:20,122
-Get back.
-Break it up.

19
00:04:20,297 --> 00:04:23,425
-Get back. Get back.
-We good.

20
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,592
All right, all right, let's hear it
for the Thug Unit.

21
00:04:28,672 --> 00:04:29,900
Yeah!

22
00:04:30,307 --> 00:04:33,470
Give it up for the Goon Squad!

23
00:04:34,611 --> 00:04:39,105
What's up?
I think the Goon Squad got it, y'all.

24
00:04:40,584 --> 00:04:42,449
No, no, no.
Double or nothing says you got lucky.

25
00:04:46,089 --> 00:04:47,579
It's on.

26
00:04:49,126 --> 00:04:52,027
-Let's go! Let's go!
-What the hell are you doing?

27
00:04:52,196 --> 00:04:53,857
Man, I'm out.

28
00:04:55,265 --> 00:04:56,823
What the hell you walking away for?

29
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,627
I say we double up on these niggas.

30
00:04:58,802 --> 00:05:01,669
-You know this ain't our spot, D.
-Sphere's crew don't know us.

31
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:03,534
Don't know
what we're bringing, period.

32
00:05:03,707 --> 00:05:06,005
-The more paper we take home.
-Did you see that cat?

33
00:05:06,176 --> 00:05:08,838
If he thinks he's being hustled,
that's paper we won't spend.

34
00:05:09,012 --> 00:05:11,003
-Why are you acting all scared?
-I'm not.

35
00:05:11,181 --> 00:05:13,877
-I'm acting smart. You try it!
-Don't I always got your back?

36
00:05:14,051 --> 00:05:15,609
Don't I always have your back?

37
00:05:15,786 --> 00:05:19,347
-You know I got it, man, but I'm....
-If you ain't with it, just go home.

38
00:05:19,523 --> 00:05:21,855
-Like you could do this without me.
-For real, DJ.

39
00:05:22,593 --> 00:05:24,151
We ain't shit without your brother.

40
00:05:24,328 --> 00:05:28,287
You know, it's gonna get
nasty up in here!

41
00:05:28,465 --> 00:05:30,990
-Don't wanna let stuff get out of hand--
-Don't sweat it.

42
00:05:31,168 --> 00:05:33,636
We came too far to turn back now,
baby boy. I want this.

43
00:05:33,804 --> 00:05:36,602
You want this? I knew you'd say
something like you want this.

44
00:05:36,773 --> 00:05:39,765
That's all this is about. Typical DJ.

45
00:05:40,043 --> 00:05:42,944
It's not just about you,
it's about all of us. We're a team.

46
00:05:44,848 --> 00:05:48,181
Well, this team's about to double up
on their asses. Come on.

47
00:05:48,352 --> 00:05:51,116
All right now, y'all ready to rip this?

48
00:05:51,755 --> 00:05:54,656
Let's get it going on up in this mall!

49
00:05:54,825 --> 00:05:56,019
Let's go!

50
00:09:11,154 --> 00:09:14,317
It's over! It's over!
All right, all right, y'all!

51
00:09:14,491 --> 00:09:19,019
This one, hands down,
the Goon Squad!

52
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,491
You're dead! You're dead!

53
00:09:32,843 --> 00:09:34,674
Goon Squad! Goon Squad is up.

54
00:09:36,213 --> 00:09:38,340
I'm telling you, man,
we're taking over L.A.

55
00:09:38,515 --> 00:09:40,176
-Believe that.
-Yeah.

56
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:41,681
Hold up, guys.

57
00:09:41,885 --> 00:09:44,786
-Hey, man, what's your brother doing?
-Man, I don't know.

58
00:09:51,762 --> 00:09:55,289
-I got a little something for y'all.
-All right. All right.

59
00:09:55,465 --> 00:09:57,660
That's what's up.
You know what I'm saying?

60
00:09:59,002 --> 00:10:00,902
Yeah, man.

61
00:10:01,571 --> 00:10:03,596
We gotta take Von home.
His mom's gonna trip.

62
00:10:03,774 --> 00:10:04,763
I have your mama.

63
00:10:04,941 --> 00:10:07,273
-He'll get a beating.
-Miss Williams ain't banging on me.

64
00:10:07,444 --> 00:10:10,811
-Why you gotta do my mom like that?
-I was doing her like that. Last night.

65
00:10:11,848 --> 00:10:14,373
Give me my money!

66
00:10:29,733 --> 00:10:31,064
I got it! I got it!

67
00:10:32,302 --> 00:10:35,396
-I want my money.
-The money's mine.

68
00:10:37,174 --> 00:10:38,698
I want it.

69
00:10:40,777 --> 00:10:43,575
Where's my money?
Where's my money?

70
00:10:45,182 --> 00:10:47,150
Get out of here.

71
00:10:52,122 --> 00:10:53,589
D!

72
00:10:53,757 --> 00:10:57,591
-Let's get out of here! Let's go!
-Let's go. Move it!

73
00:11:01,331 --> 00:11:02,958
Get up, D!

74
00:11:03,133 --> 00:11:05,124
Come on!

75
00:11:09,706 --> 00:11:12,231
I'm sorry, man, I'm sorry.

76
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,878
Somebody do something!

77
00:12:22,145 --> 00:12:25,114
<i>We'd like to welcome
all arriving passengers to Atlanta,</i>

78
00:12:48,238 --> 00:12:49,967
We are so glad
to have you here, DJ.

79
00:12:51,908 --> 00:12:54,604
You're in Atlanta, we'll get you
a Hawks jersey or something.

80
00:12:54,778 --> 00:12:56,211
Honey, nobody watches the Hawks.

81
00:12:56,379 --> 00:12:59,371
That's your uncle's way
of saying welcome to Georgia.

82
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:02,782
You'll get used to the humidity.

83
00:13:18,868 --> 00:13:21,098
You must be so excited
to start school.

84
00:13:21,271 --> 00:13:22,602
Or nervous.

85
00:13:22,772 --> 00:13:24,967
But don't be. You'll do just fine.

86
00:13:25,809 --> 00:13:28,300
You know that's where
I met your uncle.

87
00:13:30,313 --> 00:13:31,575
You guys went to Truth?

88
00:13:31,748 --> 00:13:34,683
I did. Your uncle was working there.

89
00:13:35,251 --> 00:13:38,379
Come on, let me show you
up to your room. This way.

90
00:13:43,994 --> 00:13:47,691
That's your bathroom over there,
and this is your room.

91
00:13:50,133 --> 00:13:52,795
If you get tired of campus food,
you're more than welcome...

92
00:13:52,969 --> 00:13:55,802
...to spend your weekends
here with us, anytime.

93
00:13:55,972 --> 00:13:57,769
You know,
whatever makes you comfortable.

94
00:13:57,941 --> 00:13:59,499
Thanks.

95
00:14:03,546 --> 00:14:08,279
DJ, I didn't get a chance to tell you
at the funeral...

96
00:14:09,285 --> 00:14:11,276
...but you know we loved him.

97
00:14:12,722 --> 00:14:14,383
I know how close you two were.

98
00:14:16,593 --> 00:14:18,390
I gotta run and show a house...

99
00:14:18,561 --> 00:14:21,121
...so when I get back,
I'll make us all some dinner.

100
00:14:21,364 --> 00:14:22,353
Okay?

101
00:14:30,874 --> 00:14:33,172
Honey, go ahead
and help yourself to some apple pie.

102
00:14:33,343 --> 00:14:35,140
I know it's your favorite.

103
00:14:35,311 --> 00:14:36,710
No, no, thanks.

104
00:14:39,082 --> 00:14:41,846
You know I had to call in a favor
to get you into this school.

105
00:14:42,018 --> 00:14:43,349
-Don't make me look bad.
-Nate.

106
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,511
-No, that's cool. I'm listening.
-Good.

107
00:14:45,688 --> 00:14:47,918
Because the rules are very simple.

108
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:50,088
There's three things
you have to deal with.

109
00:14:50,627 --> 00:14:54,688
First, you must keep your grades up
at all times.

110
00:14:54,864 --> 00:14:57,492
Second, I'm in charge
of your work study program...

111
00:14:57,667 --> 00:14:59,567
...but you'll not be
treated differently...

112
00:14:59,736 --> 00:15:02,569
...nor will you behave any different
than my other 26 employees.

113
00:15:02,739 --> 00:15:05,333
-And third?
-If there's a strike three, you out.

114
00:15:05,742 --> 00:15:07,300
Period.

115
00:15:16,152 --> 00:15:17,847
DJ?

116
00:15:36,873 --> 00:15:38,636
What the hell is going on, man?

117
00:15:42,178 --> 00:15:45,807
I'm not gonna sit out here and act
like I wanna be here when I don't.

118
00:15:45,982 --> 00:15:48,883
This whole college boy thing
is not for me, man.

119
00:15:51,955 --> 00:15:54,150
You're the only thing
your mama's got left.

120
00:15:54,657 --> 00:15:58,058
There's no way I'm gonna let you
put my sister through any more pain.

121
00:15:58,495 --> 00:16:02,431
So you better make this college thing
work out. Can you appreciate that?

122
00:16:04,667 --> 00:16:08,125
Get your black ungrateful ass
in the goddamn truck.

123
00:16:13,309 --> 00:16:15,573
What'd I say, man? Get in the truck!

124
00:16:29,826 --> 00:16:32,260
At least you don't have a problem
with waking up early.

125
00:16:32,629 --> 00:16:35,621
Looks like you're just in time
for registration.

126
00:17:29,152 --> 00:17:30,881
Next.

127
00:17:49,639 --> 00:17:51,436
Yo, yo, hold my spot real quick.

128
00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:11,751
-This is my spot, thanks.
-Excuse me?

129
00:18:11,928 --> 00:18:14,328
-There was a girl saving my space.
-Nice try.

130
00:18:14,497 --> 00:18:16,488
You have to wait in line
like everybody else.

131
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:18,691
You saw me
behind the sister with the fro.

132
00:18:18,868 --> 00:18:20,392
Next.

133
00:18:21,571 --> 00:18:23,300
Now, one of you come up
to the counter.

134
00:18:54,103 --> 00:18:57,561
<i>I'm just saying it's a little early
to tell, Mom. That's all,</i>

135
00:18:59,108 --> 00:19:01,406
<i>No, I'm not saying I hate it,</i>

136
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:06,513
I'm not quitting. I promised you I'd try.
That's my word.

137
00:19:07,784 --> 00:19:09,513
I love you too.

138
00:19:09,686 --> 00:19:12,120
Okay. Bye.

139
00:19:27,937 --> 00:19:29,404
All right.

140
00:19:30,106 --> 00:19:33,405
There are only a select few things
of mine that are absolutely off-limits.

141
00:19:33,576 --> 00:19:37,945
My toothbrush, my toothpaste,
my shaving cream, and my condoms.

142
00:19:38,614 --> 00:19:40,844
Magnums, of course.
You know about the gold packs?

143
00:19:41,017 --> 00:19:43,349
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

144
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:47,214
Other than that, playboy,
anything else of mine...

145
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:49,051
...you're welcome to. Rich Brown.

146
00:19:50,793 --> 00:19:53,284
-DJ.
-Nice to meet you, sir.

147
00:19:53,763 --> 00:19:56,630
The Deltas
are having a little barbecue.

148
00:19:57,433 --> 00:20:00,027
-I've got some juice, I can get you in.
-I gotta work.

149
00:20:00,603 --> 00:20:03,197
-Classes ain't started yet.
-I got a job.

150
00:20:06,175 --> 00:20:07,904
Okay, I feel you. Which--?

151
00:20:08,444 --> 00:20:10,002
Never mind.

152
00:20:10,446 --> 00:20:13,313
All right, bro. In that case, I'll holler.

153
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,948
Yes.

154
00:20:28,231 --> 00:20:29,926
Come in.

155
00:20:36,606 --> 00:20:38,699
Don't just stand there, man.
Sit down.

156
00:20:40,743 --> 00:20:42,506
Is this your office?

157
00:20:45,982 --> 00:20:48,974
Awfully nice digs for somebody
who cuts grass.

158
00:20:49,152 --> 00:20:50,744
No, I don't cut grass.

159
00:20:52,422 --> 00:20:53,650
But you do.

160
00:21:08,771 --> 00:21:10,898
<i>You ever wonder
where them trains be going?</i>

161
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:14,699
They probably be going to Japan
or something.

162
00:21:14,877 --> 00:21:16,708
-Japan?
-Oh, yeah, they can't cross water.

163
00:21:16,879 --> 00:21:19,347
You going to college?
Don't say that when you get there.

164
00:21:19,515 --> 00:21:20,880
I'm just playing with you, man.

165
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:25,646
The key to success in going to school,
what you do, you get a group of girls...

166
00:21:25,822 --> 00:21:27,414
...you get them
to do your homework.

167
00:21:27,924 --> 00:21:30,791
<i>When they do your homework,
you get A 's,</i>

168
00:21:41,571 --> 00:21:44,335
-How's it going, man?
-I'm still standing.

169
00:21:46,609 --> 00:21:48,804
Get in, man.
I'll give you a ride back.

170
00:22:00,423 --> 00:22:02,653
Come on. Come on.
Pass the ball. Pass the ball.

171
00:22:02,825 --> 00:22:05,919
Yeah, baby. Go deep. Go long.

172
00:22:09,365 --> 00:22:11,799
They're getting the
very same education as you...

173
00:22:12,201 --> 00:22:14,192
...so don't pay them any mind.

174
00:22:25,381 --> 00:22:26,575
Oh, check it out.

175
00:22:26,749 --> 00:22:29,513
Oh, that's old news, brother.
I've been there and done that.

176
00:22:29,719 --> 00:22:31,311
-You're lying.
-I'm not lying.

177
00:22:32,388 --> 00:22:33,719
Rich--

178
00:22:37,026 --> 00:22:38,653
DJ, right?

179
00:22:38,828 --> 00:22:41,160
My new roommate, DJ.
DJ, that's my friend Noel.

180
00:22:41,364 --> 00:22:42,524
Good to meet you, brother.

181
00:22:46,502 --> 00:22:47,935
Now, Thetas.

182
00:22:48,104 --> 00:22:50,868
Everybody got quiet like
y'all can't get down!

183
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,803
<i>What?</i>

184
00:22:56,379 --> 00:22:58,677
Are we the Pythons?

185
00:23:01,017 --> 00:23:04,145
-What the hell are they doing, man?
-They're stomping the yard.

186
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,151
<i>Yes,</i>

187
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:09,157
Where are you from?

188
00:23:09,325 --> 00:23:11,190
-The Thetas are representing.
-All day.

189
00:23:11,394 --> 00:23:12,827
Smooth it out now.

190
00:23:12,995 --> 00:23:16,453
<i>Funky and you know it,
clap your hands,</i>

191
00:23:17,533 --> 00:23:19,160
<i>Smooth!</i>

192
00:23:20,603 --> 00:23:22,366
<i>Smooth!</i>

00:23:23,739 --> 00:23:25,900
<i>Smooth!</i>

194
00:23:26,842 --> 00:23:28,935
<i>-Yo, I meant to--
-Smooth!</i>

195
00:23:29,879 --> 00:23:31,676
<i>-Theta Nu!
-Theta what?</i>

196
00:23:31,847 --> 00:23:33,178
<i>-Theta Nu!

197
00:23:33,349 --> 00:23:34,680
<i>-Theta Nu!
-Theta what?</i>

198
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:36,442
<i>Theta Nu!</i>

199
00:23:36,619 --> 00:23:37,984
<i>Theta Nu!</i>

200
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,266
Get him out of here!
Get him out of here!

201
00:23:53,436 --> 00:23:56,064
Yo, get your hands off me, dog.

202
00:23:58,474 --> 00:24:00,874
Fool, you're about
to get your ass whooped.

203
00:24:01,077 --> 00:24:03,136
Throw his ass to the wolves!

204
00:24:06,415 --> 00:24:08,440
Can I get up here, man?
Because I can't see.

205
00:24:08,618 --> 00:24:11,086
-Yeah?
-Hey, isn't that your boy, DJ?

206
00:24:11,253 --> 00:24:12,845
Hold it, G.

207
00:24:13,022 --> 00:24:14,250
Listen, man.

208
00:24:14,423 --> 00:24:16,220
I don't know
if you're crazy or stupid...

209
00:24:16,392 --> 00:24:18,724
-...but you gotta keep it moving.
-Hey, Zeke!

210
00:24:19,795 --> 00:24:21,660
When you're done playing
with your bitch...

211
00:24:21,831 --> 00:24:24,493
...we're gonna show you
what a real ass-whooping look like.

212
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,669
Line up, Mus!

213
00:24:34,043 --> 00:24:35,635
Mus, march!

214
00:24:48,524 --> 00:24:50,082
Mus, hut!

215
00:24:50,493 --> 00:24:52,859
Back it up! Back it up! Back it up!

-Hey.
-Hey.

243
00:27:28,317 --> 00:27:29,807
How are you doing?

244
00:27:31,453 --> 00:27:35,219
Aren't you that guy that was fighting
with that girl in the line?

245
00:27:35,724 --> 00:27:37,624
Yeah, but it wasn't like that.

246
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,550
April!

247
00:27:40,262 --> 00:27:41,729
-Hey, babe.
-What's up, baby girl?

248
00:27:41,931 --> 00:27:45,298
-I thought I told you to wait for me.
-I know, I had to go to the library.

249
00:27:46,168 --> 00:27:48,261
-Who's your friend?
-DJ.

250
00:27:48,971 --> 00:27:51,462
DJ was just passing by.

251
00:27:52,208 --> 00:27:54,039
Oh, yeah. I remember you.

252
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:56,474
You're the idiot
that tried to break our step line.

253
00:27:56,812 --> 00:27:59,440
Yeah, well, it seems like DJ
has a thing with lines.

254
00:28:02,184 --> 00:28:04,118
You see those flags there?

255
00:28:04,286 --> 00:28:07,346
You don't mess with the Mus
and you don't mess with my girl.

256
00:28:09,525 --> 00:28:11,220
I'm gonna bounce.

257
00:28:38,254 --> 00:28:40,051
You don't know
what you're talking about.

258
00:28:40,256 --> 00:28:42,622
Here, it's all about the haves
and the have-mores.

259
00:28:42,791 --> 00:28:46,158
Either you come in first place
or you're not even in the game, player.

260
00:28:46,328 --> 00:28:49,092
Oh, yo, guys, this is DJ.

261
00:28:49,265 --> 00:28:51,927
You know Noel, this is Byron, Paul.

262
00:28:52,334 --> 00:28:53,892
-That's Easy over there.
-What's up?

263
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:56,668
Yo, get that camera out of my face,
man.

264
00:28:57,172 --> 00:29:00,107
I was saying Theta Nu Theta is
gonna wipe the floor with Mu Gamma.

265
00:29:01,076 --> 00:29:03,101
-How's that?
-Because I'm gonna join.

266
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:06,510
Dude, why are you pledging
Theta anyway? They tired.

267
00:29:06,682 --> 00:29:09,173
-They pull no women.
-They never win step championships.

268
00:29:09,351 --> 00:29:11,444
-So?
-"So?"

269
00:29:12,021 --> 00:29:13,886
-What else is there?
-What about history?

270
00:29:14,089 --> 00:29:16,853
What about tradition?
Give me my damn hat.

271
00:29:17,026 --> 00:29:18,755
-What about legacy?
-A legacy of losing.

272
00:29:19,228 --> 00:29:21,696
He's just saying that
because his father was a Theta.

273
00:29:21,864 --> 00:29:23,832
Anyway, DJ,
please ignore their ignorance.

274
00:29:23,999 --> 00:29:26,593
You need to roll with us
to the Rep Yo' City Blast tonight.

275
00:29:26,769 --> 00:29:28,532
-Roll with us.
-To the what?

276
00:29:31,907 --> 00:29:35,343
Where my St. Louis folks at?
S-T-L, show some love.

277
00:29:35,511 --> 00:29:39,572
You know how we do it every week at
the Phoenix! Give me love, Miami.

278
00:29:40,082 --> 00:29:43,051
C-H-I,
my Chicago folks in the building.

279
00:29:43,252 --> 00:29:45,584
Show some love.
Give it up for the A hometown people.

280
00:29:45,754 --> 00:29:47,153
Where you at? Show your A.

281
00:29:47,323 --> 00:29:49,450
I see you, Jamaica.
Do your thing, mon.

282
00:29:51,593 --> 00:29:55,256
Watch out for the lovely ladies
in blue and white. I see you.

283
00:29:56,465 --> 00:29:57,693
-What's up, sir?
-What's up?

284
00:29:57,866 --> 00:29:59,493
You good, man?

285
00:29:59,668 --> 00:30:02,159
Oh, damn, Rich.
You hanging with the freshmen now?

286
00:30:02,338 --> 00:30:03,896
-What?
-Oh, no. This is my roommate.

287
00:30:04,073 --> 00:30:05,665
This is DJ. DJ, this is Grant.

288
00:30:05,841 --> 00:30:09,675
That's nice. But see,
this section is for upperclassmen.

289
00:30:10,412 --> 00:30:12,812
You know what we call freshmen?

290
00:30:13,015 --> 00:30:16,246
We call them bootlickers,
because that's all they good for.

291
00:30:17,953 --> 00:30:19,648
You know
what we call guys like you?

292
00:30:19,822 --> 00:30:21,619
-No, what?
-Pretenders.

293
00:30:22,891 --> 00:30:25,416
-You're gonna wish I was pretending--
-You don't know me.

294
00:30:25,594 --> 00:30:26,959
Okay, okay! Okay, okay!

295
00:30:27,129 --> 00:30:29,620
And on that note,
we gonna go to the bar.

296
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:31,889
Y'all have a good night.

297
00:30:32,434 --> 00:30:34,425
Why you so sensitive, dog?

298
00:30:34,603 --> 00:30:37,265
It's a little freshman hazing.
We all have to go through it.

299
00:30:37,439 --> 00:30:39,270
Straight up,
that dude is whack, man.

300
00:30:39,441 --> 00:30:42,842
Well, maybe.
But he's Zeke's prodigy.

301
00:30:43,012 --> 00:30:45,640
-Who the hell is Zeke?
-He's the head of Mu Gamma.

302
00:30:45,881 --> 00:30:47,644
Seven-time national step champs.

303
00:30:47,816 --> 00:30:50,751
And your boy, Grant, he's next in line
to take the throne.

304
00:30:50,919 --> 00:30:52,750
-Just chill.
-You're killing me with that.

305
00:30:52,921 --> 00:30:55,549
Every week, you know
how we do it in the Phoenix.

306
00:30:55,724 --> 00:30:57,123
Go to the dance floor.

307
00:30:57,292 --> 00:31:00,193
Rep your city, wherever you're from.
It's about that time.

308
00:31:00,362 --> 00:31:03,160
We got N-Y-C, obviously.

309
00:31:12,975 --> 00:31:15,409
I hope he had a condom on.

310
00:31:17,446 --> 00:31:18,970
What's he doing?

311
00:31:23,619 --> 00:31:25,883
-Didn't think you were coming.
-What are you doing?

312
00:31:26,055 --> 00:31:27,886
Come on.
Don't play at being jealous.

313
00:31:28,057 --> 00:31:29,388
I'm not playing at anything.

314
00:31:29,558 --> 00:31:30,786
It was just a show.

315
00:31:31,326 --> 00:31:32,725
Well, I didn't like it.

316
00:31:32,895 --> 00:31:36,490
It's not like I was doing it for real.
I was just adding a little flavor.

317
00:31:36,665 --> 00:31:39,429
Keep yourself looking this fine,
you ain't never gotta worry.

318
00:31:40,335 --> 00:31:41,666
Excuse me?

319
00:31:41,837 --> 00:31:44,067
Hey, Grant. Where are you at?
Your city needs you.

320
00:31:44,239 --> 00:31:46,605
Sit down with your girls,
have another drink on me...

321
00:31:46,775 --> 00:31:48,402
...and watch your man do his thing.

322
00:31:55,284 --> 00:31:57,684
He's just being a man.

323
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:01,383
There isn't a single woman in here
that wouldn't kill to be with him.

324
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:04,557
-Don't make it easy on them.
-You know you don't deserve that.

325
00:32:08,397 --> 00:32:09,955
It's not that big of a deal.

326
00:32:10,132 --> 00:32:12,327
Didn't I tell you to keep
your distance from my girl?

327
00:32:12,534 --> 00:32:15,298
See, now, I thought you was just
pretending again.

328
00:32:15,471 --> 00:32:18,372
New York City, where you at?
Rep your city, it's your turn!

329
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:20,565
Grant, they need you on the floor.

330
00:32:20,742 --> 00:32:23,370
When I'm done,
you better be gone...

331
00:32:24,346 --> 00:32:26,314
...bootlicker.

332
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,314
-I can take care of myself.
-I know you can.

333
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:37,084
No, really. Grant is not someone
you want to mess with.

334
00:32:37,259 --> 00:32:39,420
Somebody's gonna have to
bring him down a notch.

335
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,661
What the hell is this nigga doing?

336
00:32:50,072 --> 00:32:53,200
What's this? It looks like we got
a new addition added to the mix.

337
00:32:53,375 --> 00:32:55,900
Hey, yo, kid.
What city you representing?

338
00:32:56,078 --> 00:32:57,875
I ain't repping nothing. Just me.

339
00:33:27,476 --> 00:33:29,341
Oh, don't clown him. Don't clown him.

340
00:33:29,511 --> 00:33:32,378
You'll hurt him, Grant. Don't hurt him.

341
00:33:32,614 --> 00:33:34,343
Y'all know
how Grant does it, y'all.

342
00:33:34,683 --> 00:33:38,346
Give it up for G, Grant.
New York in the house!

343
00:33:59,007 --> 00:34:01,805
Oh, snap!
Is he clowning St. Louis?

344
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,643
Is he breaking on Jamaica?

345
00:34:08,283 --> 00:34:10,979
Wait a minute.
Oh, he's clowning everybody!

346
00:34:11,153 --> 00:34:12,620
He's clowning on the Chi guy!

347
00:34:15,357 --> 00:34:19,851
Oh, this is crazy.
A-T-L, are you gonna take that?

348
00:34:23,832 --> 00:34:26,266
Miami! Even Miami!

349
00:34:35,377 --> 00:34:38,369
Wait a minute.
Is he coming at Grant?

350
00:34:46,922 --> 00:34:48,287
Wait, he's killing him!

351
00:34:51,526 --> 00:34:53,858
That's my roommate.
That's my roommate.

352
00:34:54,029 --> 00:34:55,724
Give it up, D!

353
00:34:55,964 --> 00:34:58,296
Oh, no, he didn't. Yes, he did.

354
00:35:12,347 --> 00:35:13,336
Yo, goodness.

355
00:35:15,717 --> 00:35:18,447
So I guess you thought
you were defending my honor, huh?

356
00:35:18,887 --> 00:35:22,220
-April, what are you doing?
-I'm just talking.

357
00:35:23,292 --> 00:35:26,159
You don't have to let this dude
talk to you like that.

358
00:35:26,628 --> 00:35:28,493
-Let's just drop it.
-No. What did you say?

359
00:35:28,664 --> 00:35:31,064
Somebody'll have to teach you
how to talk to a woman.

360
00:35:31,233 --> 00:35:33,758
-You gonna show me?
-I already schooled you once tonight.

361
00:35:33,935 --> 00:35:36,836
-How much do you wanna learn?
-What, you think you funny, nigga?

362
00:35:37,005 --> 00:35:39,269
Nah...but she clearly does.

363
00:35:39,841 --> 00:35:42,071
-What? No, no, no, Grant.
-It's all good, baby.

364
00:35:42,244 --> 00:35:43,472
-Let's go.
-Come on.

365
00:35:43,645 --> 00:35:44,873
Hey, stop.

366
00:35:45,047 --> 00:35:48,107
Grant, stop it, stop. Stop.

367
00:35:48,317 --> 00:35:49,545
-Let's go.
-Stay out of this.

368
00:35:49,718 --> 00:35:51,117
All right, just chill. Grant.

369
00:35:51,286 --> 00:35:53,754
I ain't got nothing against you,
but I told you already.

370
00:35:53,922 --> 00:35:56,482
-This is my roommate, man.
-You do what you gotta do.

371
00:35:56,658 --> 00:35:58,683
Noel, I thought
you was gonna pledge Mu Gamma.

372
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:01,420
-I was gonna--
-I guess you can kiss that goodbye.

373
00:36:01,797 --> 00:36:02,786
I'm gonna bounce.

374
00:36:02,964 --> 00:36:05,091
We got unfinished
business, bootlicker.

375
00:36:05,801 --> 00:36:08,326
-Indeed.
-Come on, let's go.

376
00:36:08,503 --> 00:36:11,939
I got myself here.
I can get myself home.

377
00:36:12,107 --> 00:36:14,268
Maya, will you take me home?

378
00:36:28,423 --> 00:36:31,881
Chill out, man.
This is a friendly visit.

379
00:36:32,494 --> 00:36:35,122
I'm Zeke,
president of Mu Gamma Xi.

380
00:36:35,297 --> 00:36:36,958
You know Grant.

381
00:36:37,232 --> 00:36:39,359
We saw you at the Phoenix
and we were impressed.

382
00:36:40,369 --> 00:36:41,893
Ain't that right, Grant?

383
00:36:42,904 --> 00:36:43,962
Yeah.

384
00:36:45,707 --> 00:36:46,696
I got work to do, man.

385
00:36:50,345 --> 00:36:52,040
Wolves!

386
00:36:52,414 --> 00:36:54,314
Y'all heard the man. Get busy.

387
00:37:00,322 --> 00:37:03,257
Now that you got time
on your hands, let's talk.

388
00:37:05,594 --> 00:37:07,528
Look, I brought Grant with me
to show you...

389
00:37:07,696 --> 00:37:09,823
...that we don't have
any hard feelings.

390
00:37:10,699 --> 00:37:14,226
You're a straight-up guy. I like that.
Working your way through college.

391
00:37:14,436 --> 00:37:16,700
That's admirable,
but this whole gardening thing...

392
00:37:16,872 --> 00:37:19,397
...can't be getting you any play
with the ladies, man.

393
00:37:19,574 --> 00:37:21,166
Never had any problems
in that area.

394
00:37:21,343 --> 00:37:24,039
Okay,
now I'll get straight to the point.

395
00:37:24,212 --> 00:37:29,047
Mu Gamma Xi has the strongest
alumni network, period.

396
00:37:29,217 --> 00:37:31,082
One phone call from us
when you graduate...

397
00:37:31,253 --> 00:37:33,483
...you've got a high-paying job
just like that.

398
00:37:33,655 --> 00:37:35,520
So you want me to join your frat?

399
00:37:35,857 --> 00:37:37,882
If you step on our line.

400
00:37:38,693 --> 00:37:41,958
Step on the line. I don't step, man.

401
00:37:42,898 --> 00:37:43,887
I battle.

402
00:37:45,133 --> 00:37:47,693
-What's the difference?
-Pussies step.

403
00:37:50,305 --> 00:37:53,297
You should think about what you say
before you say it.

404
00:37:54,976 --> 00:37:56,204
Wolves!

405
00:37:57,779 --> 00:37:59,576
That's enough.

406
00:38:00,115 --> 00:38:01,946
Let's let Mr. DJ get back to his....

407
00:38:04,252 --> 00:38:06,152
His gardening.

408
00:38:10,192 --> 00:38:12,990
-You were right.
-I told you.

409
00:38:16,998 --> 00:38:18,192
I'm telling you, Sly.

410
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,633
You didn't see
this dude punk Grant.

411
00:38:21,803 --> 00:38:25,500
Look, I'm sure he's a cool dude,
I just don't think he's Theta material.

412
00:38:25,674 --> 00:38:26,936
You mean he's too ghetto.

413
00:38:27,108 --> 00:38:28,473
I don't care where he's from.

414
00:38:28,643 --> 00:38:30,634
I don't think he got here
based on his SAT's.

415
00:38:30,812 --> 00:38:33,610
Okay, fine, so he's not the archetype
of a Theta, but what he--

416
00:38:33,782 --> 00:38:36,717
We got other pledges to consider
who have more impressive résumés.

417
00:38:36,885 --> 00:38:37,874
Thank you.

418
00:38:38,053 --> 00:38:40,078
But are they gonna help us
win Nationals?

419
00:38:40,255 --> 00:38:42,723
Okay, okay,
so that's what this is about?

420
00:38:42,891 --> 00:38:46,418
What are you thinking? Aren't you sick
of living in Mu Gamma's shadow?

421
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:57,695
I'm sorry. Mind if I join you?

422
00:39:01,943 --> 00:39:03,501
Suit yourself.

423
00:39:05,514 --> 00:39:07,880
I'm here to talk to you
about Theta Nu Theta.

424
00:39:09,484 --> 00:39:11,111
You're kidding, right?

425
00:39:11,286 --> 00:39:12,810
No.

426
00:39:13,889 --> 00:39:16,551
-What about it?
-Members of my pledge committee...

427
00:39:16,725 --> 00:39:19,819
-...feel you'd be an asset to the house.
-No.

428
00:39:19,995 --> 00:39:22,259
Mu Gamma's murdered your asses
for seven years.

429
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:24,295
You're here
because you think I can help.

430
00:39:24,466 --> 00:39:27,060
You know, you're cocky for a brother
that's got one trick.

431
00:39:27,235 --> 00:39:28,566
Please spare me, man.

432
00:39:30,105 --> 00:39:31,470
Spare you, fine.

433
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:34,473
There's a screening process.
All applicants go through it.

434
00:39:34,643 --> 00:39:35,803
You want to apply?

435
00:39:36,578 --> 00:39:37,806
That's up to you.

436
00:39:37,979 --> 00:39:40,038
Mu Gamma comes here
offering me a sweet deal.

437
00:39:40,215 --> 00:39:43,514
And the best you can come up
with is I can apply?

438
00:39:43,685 --> 00:39:48,315
If a sweet deal is really what
you're looking for, Theta ain't for you.

439
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:53,621
A fraternity, now, that's a brotherhood
of men who forge a lifetime bond.

440
00:39:55,063 --> 00:39:58,590
Okay, once you are a Theta, you will
always and forever be a Theta.

441
00:39:58,767 --> 00:40:01,827
Now, you can go out of here,
you can leave Truth...

442
00:40:02,003 --> 00:40:04,733
...as a young educated brother
from the 'hood.

443
00:40:04,906 --> 00:40:06,203
And homey, that's great.

444
00:40:07,609 --> 00:40:11,943
But if you pledge Theta, you're gonna
get that same education...

445
00:40:12,113 --> 00:40:15,844
...and you'll become a member
of our lifetime brotherhood.

446
00:40:37,906 --> 00:40:40,534
-Yo, what's up?
-Hey, hey, what are you doing?

447
00:40:40,709 --> 00:40:42,643
You almost just ran me over
with that thing.

448
00:40:42,811 --> 00:40:45,541
-I didn't mean to scare you. My bad.
-What?

449
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:50,709
It's the dance thug from the club.

450
00:40:51,653 --> 00:40:53,883
So can we move on from that?

451
00:40:54,055 --> 00:40:55,613
Move on to what?

452
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:57,451
I don't know.

453
00:40:57,926 --> 00:40:59,154
You getting to know me?

454
00:41:00,228 --> 00:41:01,855
I have a boyfriend.

455
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:06,228
So, what's up with this Grant?
What is he, a professional student?

456
00:41:06,401 --> 00:41:08,392
Grant is in a six-year law program...

457
00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:12,097
...and his father's a partner with a Wall
Street firm, so when he graduates--

458
00:41:12,273 --> 00:41:15,868
It's funny, because I didn't take you as
the type of girl that could be bought.

459
00:41:16,044 --> 00:41:17,375
Bought?

460
00:41:17,846 --> 00:41:19,074
Bought.

461
00:41:19,247 --> 00:41:22,683
Wait, I didn't mean bought like that.
I didn't mean bought like that. Listen.

462
00:41:22,851 --> 00:41:24,512
-What?
-Let's just start over.

463
00:41:24,686 --> 00:41:27,120
-Start what over?
-Have lunch with me.

464
00:41:27,288 --> 00:41:28,846
I'm tutoring.

465
00:41:30,759 --> 00:41:33,592
Tutor what? What do you tutor?

466
00:41:53,081 --> 00:41:54,275
Yo.

467
00:41:54,449 --> 00:41:56,940
-Hi, can I help you?
-I'd like to sign up for a tutor.

468
00:41:57,118 --> 00:41:58,813
Okay. What subject?

469
00:41:58,987 --> 00:42:02,013
What subject
does April Palmer tutor?

470
00:42:02,524 --> 00:42:04,890
-History.
-History it is.

471
00:42:25,613 --> 00:42:27,604
How'd you pull this off?

472
00:42:27,782 --> 00:42:29,147
What?

473
00:42:29,484 --> 00:42:31,008
What, you think I set this up?

474
00:42:31,186 --> 00:42:33,552
Well, it's an awful big coincidence,
don't you think?

475
00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:37,224
What you take me for?
Some kind of stalker?

476
00:42:37,392 --> 00:42:39,724
Like I'm gonna work that hard
to get your attention.

477
00:42:39,894 --> 00:42:43,762
I mean you're fine, but you ain't
all that, you know what I'm saying?

478
00:42:43,932 --> 00:42:45,399
Did I set this up?

479
00:42:46,868 --> 00:42:48,768
Can I use your pen?

480
00:42:48,937 --> 00:42:50,837
-Yeah. Okay.
-Thanks.

481
00:42:52,507 --> 00:42:53,838
So where do we start?

482
00:42:54,542 --> 00:42:57,272
You can start by moving over there.

483
00:43:00,749 --> 00:43:03,775
-Really?
-No, I'm serious.

484
00:43:03,952 --> 00:43:07,080
It works better if we can sit
across from each other.

485
00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:10,517
All right.

486
00:43:18,133 --> 00:43:21,193
This is gonna be good
reading material for you.

487
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:24,404
Time to go.

488
00:43:24,773 --> 00:43:27,708
-Thank God. I'm starving.
-So let's go eat.

489
00:43:28,476 --> 00:43:29,738
I can't.

490
00:43:30,111 --> 00:43:31,806
Why?

491
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:33,880
You know why.

492
00:43:39,521 --> 00:43:41,113
Why are you staring at me?

493
00:43:43,925 --> 00:43:45,449
Okay.

494
00:43:46,127 --> 00:43:47,651
I'll make you a deal.

495
00:43:47,829 --> 00:43:50,923
Ask me any question
from the history lesson, I get it right...

496
00:43:51,099 --> 00:43:52,566
...we go eat.

497
00:43:56,704 --> 00:43:57,932
Okay.

498
00:43:59,741 --> 00:44:01,800
What was the difference
between Republicans'...

499
00:44:01,976 --> 00:44:03,841
...and the Democrats'
political response...

500
00:44:04,012 --> 00:44:06,674
...to the Great Depression
in the 1930s?

501
00:44:14,222 --> 00:44:16,656
Some other time maybe.

502
00:44:16,825 --> 00:44:20,158
But by political response, were you
referring to the Republicans' belief...

503
00:44:20,328 --> 00:44:22,319
...that the marketplace
will correct itself...

504
00:44:22,497 --> 00:44:24,294
...as opposed to
the Democrats' New Deal?

505
00:44:24,465 --> 00:44:26,763
Because the way
you phrased it was....

506
00:44:28,837 --> 00:44:30,202
I'll get my uncle's truck.

507
00:44:30,872 --> 00:44:32,635
I'll drive.

508
00:44:44,185 --> 00:44:46,949
So I heard the Mu Gammas
are trying to recruit you.

509
00:44:47,522 --> 00:44:49,490
So are you gonna pledge?

510
00:44:49,657 --> 00:44:52,353
Probably not. I don't wanna step.

511
00:44:52,527 --> 00:44:55,826
Being in a fraternity is about
a lot more than just stepping.

512
00:44:56,264 --> 00:44:59,131
Wow, you sound just like them.

513
00:45:01,102 --> 00:45:04,401
-You should check out Heritage Hall.
-What's that?

514
00:45:04,772 --> 00:45:06,535
See for yourself.

515
00:45:07,575 --> 00:45:09,167
Oh, it's right up here on the right.

516
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:51,981
How does a nice young girl like
yourself know about a place like this?

517
00:45:52,153 --> 00:45:53,882
We gonna take five. Be right back.

518
00:45:54,055 --> 00:45:57,081
There's a lot of things about me
you don't know.

519
00:46:22,984 --> 00:46:25,077
I didn't know you can do that.
I'm surprised.

520
00:46:25,253 --> 00:46:26,982
Let me show you how we do it in A.

521
00:46:27,422 --> 00:46:29,390
All right, I'm not mad.
I'm not mad at all.

522
00:46:29,557 --> 00:46:30,649
-Really?
-No.

523
00:46:33,261 --> 00:46:35,161
You wanna sit down?

524
00:46:37,465 --> 00:46:38,898
No.

525
00:47:34,789 --> 00:47:36,848
-I can't do this.
-What's wrong with this?

526
00:47:37,025 --> 00:47:39,721
-We're just having a little fun.
-I know. We just need to go.

527
00:50:36,871 --> 00:50:38,304
Let's heat it up.

528
00:51:08,603 --> 00:51:11,766
Yo, this one. Look at the map.
I'm telling you, it's this one.

529
00:51:17,678 --> 00:51:18,906
Quit playing, man.

530
00:51:19,447 --> 00:51:20,812
All in!

531
00:51:58,386 --> 00:52:00,684
-Since when?
-1932.

532
00:52:01,122 --> 00:52:02,180
Bring it home!

533
00:52:03,658 --> 00:52:04,818
Bring it home!

534
00:52:07,128 --> 00:52:08,618
Come on!

535
00:52:12,066 --> 00:52:14,626
Pledges, turn...

536
00:52:14,802 --> 00:52:18,568
...and face big brother Zeus!

537
00:52:23,711 --> 00:52:26,942
Pledges, unmask yourselves!

538
00:52:34,221 --> 00:52:37,748
Pledges, Mu Gamma creed!

539
00:52:37,925 --> 00:52:40,120
<i>The year of completion,
the manifestation,</i>

540
00:52:40,294 --> 00:52:42,489
<i>1932 was the year our fathers
founded Mu,</i>

541
00:52:42,663 --> 00:52:45,131
<i>Camaraderie in gray,
we're a wolf pack of brotherhood,</i>

542
00:52:45,299 --> 00:52:48,359
<i>Fangs of power, fur of protection,
Battle cry:</i>

543
00:52:50,204 --> 00:52:52,172
By the rising of the moon!

544
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:54,865
<i>Bring us our destiny, sir!</i>

545
00:53:00,348 --> 00:53:05,081
<i>Oh, brother, we gotta keep pushing,
I wanna be a Theta Nu one day,</i>

546
00:53:05,252 --> 00:53:07,982
<i>So, big brother,
would you help me on my way?</i>

547
00:53:08,155 --> 00:53:12,285
<i>Oh, brother, we gotta keep pushing!
We gotta keep moving!</i>

548
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:13,688
<i>We gotta keep fighting!</i>

549
00:53:13,861 --> 00:53:17,388
<i>Oh, brother, we gotta keep pushing!
We gotta keep moving!</i>

550
00:53:17,565 --> 00:53:18,896
<i>We almost there!</i>

551
00:53:20,601 --> 00:53:23,798
Pledges of Theta Nu Theta,
face front!

552
00:53:28,976 --> 00:53:30,136
Reveal yourselves!

553
00:53:37,017 --> 00:53:40,885
Pledge Porkchop,
please introduce yourself!

554
00:53:49,063 --> 00:53:50,792
Porkchop!

555
00:53:50,965 --> 00:53:52,762
Extra gravy.
