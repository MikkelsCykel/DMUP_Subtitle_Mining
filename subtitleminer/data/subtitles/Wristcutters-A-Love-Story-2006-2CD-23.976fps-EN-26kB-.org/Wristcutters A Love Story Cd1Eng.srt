1
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,755
I think she cried at my funeral.

2
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:25,593
I don't mean to brag about it or anything,

3
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:29,294
but I'm pretty sure she did.

4
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:33,305
Sometimes I can picture her talking about me

5
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:35,500
to some guy she feels really close to.

6
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:38,373
You're never going
to see him again, you know?

7
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,036
How they lowered me
into the grave

8
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,375
all pathetic and shriveled up,

9
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:44,314
like a melted chocolate bar
or something.

10
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:48,411
About how we never
actually got a chance.

11
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:52,049
Then the guy fucks her real nice...

12
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:55,288
a fuck that's all about
making her feel better.

13
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:22,218
Soon after I killed myself,

14
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:25,780
I found a job here at Kamikaze Pizza.

15
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:29,487
It's not a great job, but it'll do for a while.

16
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,096
The manager was cool enough

17
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,499
to hook me up with a place to live, too,

18
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:40,505
with this Austrian guy named Erik.

19
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:42,404
You did it again, Zia.

20
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:43,874
Did what?

21
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:46,036
Don't play dumb. You promised.

22
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:48,103
If you're going to live in this apartment,

23
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,274
you have to sit while you piss.

24
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,284
That. I'm sorry. I forgot.

25
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:55,947
How in the world you forget
something like that?

26
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,680
Sit, sit, sit.

27
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:12,533
Who could think
of a better punishment, really?

28
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:16,166
Everything's the same here.
It's just a little worse.

29
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:26,608
I've thought about suicide again,

30
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:28,813
but I haven't tried it.

31
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:34,520
I didn't want to end up
in a bigger shit hole than this one.

32
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:40,760
Yeah, I was missing Desiree.

33
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:44,200
I even had a feeling
that this whole suicide thing

34
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,864
just made me miss her
and love her more.

35
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:49,339
But... who knows?

36
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,877
Maybe you just need a drink.

37
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:11,430
Hi.

38
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:14,557
Listen, my friend Rachel and I,
we play this game

39
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:16,727
where we try to figure out
how people off themselves.

40
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:19,829
We were just guessing about you.

41
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:22,067
How'd you do it?

42
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:30,838
Three points for me!

43
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:34,444
That's an extremely rude question to ask.

44
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,181
Precisely.

45
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:38,849
That's what the game's all about.

46
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:40,586
I see. What about you?

47
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:43,423
Me?

48
00:07:58,177 --> 00:08:00,042
No, no, no, no, no.
Look at him.

49
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:01,943
He can't stop burping.
It's definitely drowning.

50
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:05,309
No, I'm telling you,
look at the bluish face.

51
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:07,750
It's got to be gas.

52
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,014
Go over and ask him.

53
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:14,924
No. I don't know about this one.

54
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,895
- He seems ill-humored.
- No, no, you got to...

55
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:19,625
Why don't you try it with me?

56
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,634
Do you know this guy?

57
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:32,701
I'll bet you girls a beer you won't guess.

58
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:35,246
Tania, look who's here.

59
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:37,580
We'll be right back.

60
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,948
Right back.

61
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,247
I will tell you something.

62
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,687
Whenever a chick says
"I'll be right back,"

63
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:46,622
write them off, man.

64
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:49,923
They always end up leaving
with some retarded big-Joe guy.

65
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:57,063
So what was it?

66
00:08:57,136 --> 00:08:59,001
What was what?

67
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:02,768
How did you, uh,
you know, off yourself?

68
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:04,969
Oh, that.

69
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:08,571
Let me go, lovely

70
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:10,775
Let me go

71
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,418
You guys suck!

72
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:16,750
Suck big time!

73
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:18,585
Get off the stage!

74
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:20,091
Fuck it all!

75
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:22,923
Jesus! Go home, man!

76
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:24,462
Boo!

77
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,092
You offed with the guitar?

78
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:31,602
Sure, I did.

79
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:33,104
On stage, man.

80
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:34,639
It was wild.

81
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:37,437
Iggy Pop almost came to see that gig.

82
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:13,871
No way.

83
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,538
It's true.

84
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,846
I live with my parents
and my kid brother Kostya.

85
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:21,477
You're fucking with me.

86
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:24,045
I'm not fucking with you.

87
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:27,320
I've never heard of
a whole family here before.

88
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:29,054
Mom...

89
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:32,461
offed because she was
missing Russia a lot.

90
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:41,433
And my father, he just didn't feel
like going on without her.

91
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:48,675
But what really did it for him
was my little brother turning out to be gay.

92
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:50,682
And your kid brother?

93
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,911
- Kostya?
- Kostya.

94
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:56,614
I guess he had it in his genes, man.

95
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:02,583
That's the craziest thing
I've ever heard, man.

96
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,460
When, uh, Kostya came here,

97
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:09,194
my father...
a man who wouldn't cry...

98
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:11,964
if you dropped 10-pound
sledgehammer on his foot.

99
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:14,973
Hugged kid, though,
and cried like baby. No shit.

100
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,531
Wow.

101
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,205
We have to kill those germs.

102
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,770
- For borscht...
- We have a saying in Russia.

103
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,907
How much you eat,
that's how old you are.

104
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:27,578
My grandpa, before
he'd hire anybody,

105
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:29,314
he'd feed them a free meal.

106
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:31,379
- Those who ate the most...
- Whoa.

107
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:33,391
...that's the ones
he hired, 'cause...

108
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:35,222
Those were the best workers.

109
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:38,229
Are you trying
to hire me or something?

110
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:40,162
How about
doing the dishes after dinner?

111
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:42,393
Kostya, no.

112
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:45,528
You know, Zia, dishwashing was Eugene's
first job in America.

113
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:46,696
No way.

114
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:48,364
I did a lot of shit.

115
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:51,535
Last job I had before I offed
was waiting tables.

116
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:54,135
I thought it was the band thing.

117
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,272
I had to eat, too.

118
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:59,146
You know, I wish
we were there for Eugene.

119
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:02,813
You see, Zia, all of us,
we were always together.

120
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:06,824
First in Russia,
then in America, now here.

121
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:10,555
When lvan and I came here and left our boys
alone, they just couldn't make...

122
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:12,221
Mom, that's all over now.

123
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:13,629
Yeah.

124
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:15,690
Where are you from, Zia?

125
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:17,030
Uh, New Jersey.

126
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:19,401
Oh. What about your parents?

127
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:21,337
Uh, it's... it's a long story.

128
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,671
It's not... Basically, at the end,

129
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,677
- I hadn't talk to them in a while.
- Zia, it's okay.

130
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,474
They hadn't talked to each other.

131
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:28,478
It is, yeah.

132
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:30,310
<i>Nyet.</i>

133
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:32,543
Not every family is lucky like we are.

134
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:33,880
That's true.

135
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:35,784
But all of us being together...

136
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:47,464
You know,

137
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:49,626
I'd be here a long time ago
if it weren't for Eugene.

138
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:51,533
Yeah? How come?

139
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:52,901
I was 10.

140
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:54,462
We had these soccer finals.

141
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,065
I was the goalie for my school.

142
00:12:57,643 --> 00:12:59,338
Eugene!

143
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,448
Don't you hear I'm jamming?

144
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:06,747
How is it possible
for the better team to lose?

145
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:09,879
We didn't deserve to!

146
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:14,348
The ball just wouldn't get in!

147
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:17,327
And they won it in the finals!

148
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:19,489
So what's the point of living

149
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:22,534
when life is so unfair
and everything?

150
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:25,502
I'm just telling you this because you're
the smartest person I know.

151
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:28,335
If you don't give me one
good reason to keep living

152
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:30,967
and tell me what's the meaning of life,

153
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:33,773
I'm gonna do this.

154
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,447
Step down from the table.

155
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,848
No. First tell me.

156
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,684
Step down from the table,
and I'll tell you.

157
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:07,811
He just smacked you?

158
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,144
Yeah.

159
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:13,242
I don't exactly know what he was trying
to tell me when he did it,

160
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:17,050
but it worked fine
up until a couple months ago.

161
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:23,561
You know, when I see
you guys like this,

162
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:25,256
it kind of makes me
miss my parents,

163
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:29,233
even though most of the time
they just kind of freaked me out.

164
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:38,571
You know...

165
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:43,881
why didn't we move in together earlier?

166
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:46,577
'Cause we didn't know
it'd be this fun.

167
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:47,812
Yeah.

168
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:57,392
Oh, God, I love those things.

169
00:14:57,463 --> 00:15:00,626
These what? These?

170
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:10,001
Who? Ophelia?

171
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,872
Desiree.

172
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:15,744
Whatever. An ex-girlfriend from an ex-life.

173
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:18,977
Listen, tonight when we go out,
man, you got to promise...

174
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:22,987
No, no, no. Eugene, I'm not going out
tonight or any other night.

175
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:25,683
- What?
- It just makes me depressed.

176
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:28,158
So what are you going to do?
Kill yourself?

177
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:30,491
I don't know. Maybe.

178
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:34,355
As if anything would make you happy.

179
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,799
I love you.

180
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:40,168
- I love you.
- You do?

181
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:46,677
Did you finish my cottage cheese?

182
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:51,406
Zia, did you finish my cottage cheese?

183
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:54,281
Calm down, Erik. I'll buy you
some more cottage cheese.

184
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:55,945
No. That's not the point.

185
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:59,616
I was planning on having some right now.

186
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:02,422
Don't you have a plan B
or something?

187
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:04,462
Zia, you do it all the time!

188
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:07,897
All right! All right!

189
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,231
I'll go get some more
cottage cheese.

190
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:19,208
Zia?

191
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:21,405
I was hoping we'd run into
each other sooner or later.

192
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,574
Brian, what are you doing here?

193
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,619
Same as everyone else.
Same as everyone else.

194
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:29,779
Only it's got a little something to do with you.

195
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:31,288
Oh, yeah?

196
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:34,451
Did you come all the way here
to get the 200 bucks I owe you?

197
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:36,460
Ha ha. You were always a million laughs.

198
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:37,893
But, no, that's not it.

199
00:16:37,963 --> 00:16:40,830
You know how people say that
suicides happen in threes?

200
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:43,230
Well, there's something to that.

201
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:45,827
Hey, is this cheese any good?

202
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:48,202
Uh, my roommate likes it.

203
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:50,207
You know, when people start
offing themselves around you,

204
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:52,835
you start asking yourself,
what makes me so different?

205
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:55,277
You know?
What's keeping me alive?

206
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,372
Then it hit me like a mallet.

207
00:16:57,449 --> 00:17:00,179
I don't have the answers.
Too much sodium.

208
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:03,813
But I think it was Desiree's suicide
that really hit me.

209
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:06,187
- D-Desiree's what?
- Yeah, Desiree's.

210
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:08,783
She offed herself about a month after you.
I figured you'd know that.

211
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,658
- No.
- Hey!

212
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:13,857
What about the 200 you owe me?
I still want that.

213
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:21,800
So I'm saying I got a pretty good idea

214
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,035
she's not in the city.

215
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:26,600
Call it, you know, intuition or whatever.

216
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:29,772
Listen, man, worst-case scenario,
we just take a ride, right?

217
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:31,645
Who, we?

218
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,742
All right.

219
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:35,753
Let me put it this way.

220
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:38,415
Since you got here,
how many times did you get laid, man?

221
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:41,620
- Why?
- Just a question.

222
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:45,358
Actually laid?

223
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:47,092
Yes.

224
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,134
- None, I think.
- You think?

225
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:51,601
None. But what's that got
to do with any of this?

226
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:54,104
Plenty. 'Cause your sperm count is so high,

227
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:56,038
you think you're having
an out-of-body experience

228
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:58,372
like nobody in the whole
fucking universe, man.

229
00:17:58,444 --> 00:17:59,775
Eugene.

230
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:02,405
Sperm count too high?
That's a crock.

231
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:04,244
Listen, man, just let me borrow the car.

232
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:05,749
You don't have to do anything else.

233
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:07,752
Don't... Don't get so touchy
on me all of a sudden.

234
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,084
All I said is not good enough reason
for me to go.

235
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:12,851
Listen, you know what?
Forget Desiree.

236
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,189
I got another reason for you to go.

237
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,989
Give it a shot.

238
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:18,757
You got anything better to do?

239
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,111
I mean, what's the big deal?

240
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:38,376
It's just the headlights, right?

241
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,815
You wouldn't
believe how many times

242
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:41,318
I've tried to have it fixed.

243
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:42,648
You're telling me this now?

244
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:45,656
I mean, this means we can't
drive at night. At all.

245
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:47,316
We'll stop somewhere
before it gets dark.

246
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:50,327
We'll just get them fixed.
It's on me. I'll pay for it.

247
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:51,828
If you insist.

248
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:54,229
But I'll bet you a beer it can't be fixed.

249
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:59,065
Let's get some music, man.

250
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,265
What is this? These work, right?

251
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,274
- Oh, shit.
- What?

252
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:06,243
Anything that goes underneath that seat,
forget about it.

253
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:08,711
Is there a hole or something?

254
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,270
Yeah.

255
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:11,976
No. It's, uh...

256
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:14,143
Kind of.

257
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:16,619
It's more like... I guess you'd say black hole

258
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:20,385
or a... a... a Bermuda Triangle.

259
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:24,327
You know, things just
disappear on you.

260
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,903
That's not very good.

261
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:34,404
What is it?

262
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:36,464
- It's my old band.
- Really?

263
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:38,942
I had it in my pocket when I offed.

264
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:43,147
Take that for a sec.

265
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,420
Oh, man, that's worse
than I remember.

266
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:52,423
What are you talking about? I like it.

267
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:54,425
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

268
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:55,824
It's not bad at all.

269
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:21,312
Mike's Car Shop.

270
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,013
Perfect timing, huh?

271
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:25,022
I'll bet you a beer they can't fix it.

272
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,354
You're on, man.

273
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,166
Uh, okay.

274
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:38,726
Um, uh, it's broken.

275
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:40,328
And so I don't... I don't...

276
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:43,272
I'm not sure what it is that's wrong.

277
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:47,972
But Mike is my... is my boss,
and he's an absolute genius.

278
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:49,980
We're gonna get it fixed.
You guys just wait right here.

279
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:52,676
Okay? Okay?

280
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:00,489
Hey, see that car?

281
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,460
It's been cruising back and forth
since we got here.

282
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:06,019
I saw it five times already.

283
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,259
It's a taxicab, Eugene.

284
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,198
Think, man.

285
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:13,670
Who the fuck would need taxi here?

286
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:16,333
I don't... I don't know.
What are you trying to say?

287
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:18,342
Look at the driver.

288
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,640
- Why?
- He's Arab.

289
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:23,840
You've never seen
an Arab taxi driver before?

290
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:25,678
Oh, sure, I did.

291
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:27,946
But not since I offed.

292
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,954
Connect the dots.

293
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:32,923
Arabs, suicides.

294
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:35,357
Doesn't that freak you out
even a little bit?

295
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:37,827
No, man. You sound
like a fucking, uh,

296
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:40,330
Homeland Security agent.

297
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:41,991
I mean, you forget where we are.

298
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:43,159
He's dead already.

299
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:44,793
We're dead.
Everybody here is dead.

300
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:47,395
He's not gonna try anything.
Nobody gives a shit here.

301
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:49,906
We're all immigrants now, man.

302
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,943
Then why is he looking
at me like that?

303
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:56,211
'Cause you're staring at him
like you need a fucking taxicab.

304
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:58,772
Quit looking at him. He'll go away.

305
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:01,913
Oh, shoot.

306
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:04,182
It looks like we're staying here tonight.

307
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:07,555
Hey, boy, how you doin'? You're pretty.

308
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:10,891
Hey, Jimmy, why don't you
go start this thing up?

309
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:13,692
Let's hear this beauty moan.

310
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:17,098
Well... Moan?
No, no. We just want to...

311
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,934
The headlights.

312
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:27,468
Oh, you need a...

313
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:32,779
You need an exhaust system,
valves got to be adjusted.

314
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:35,115
Oh, what a bitch
of a fuel pump you got in there.

315
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,950
No, no, no, no. No, no.

316
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,887
We just want to fix the headlights.

317
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:50,435
Honey, are you home?

318
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:52,868
Honey?

319
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:03,576
He hasn't slept a wink
since we got here.

320
00:23:06,651 --> 00:23:09,142
We'll fix your headlights by tomorrow.

321
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,984
- Get them fixed by tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

322
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,024
Yeah. Tomorrow.

323
00:23:48,794 --> 00:23:50,557
Fucking shift stick.

324
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:52,563
This is the last time I sleep in the car.

325
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:54,565
Yeah.

326
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:56,897
Where are my shades?

327
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:01,734
I dr... I dropped them.

328
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:04,742
Man, I told you to be
careful about that, man.

329
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:06,675
- I know, I know.
- God damn it.

330
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:09,509
I was, Eugene. It's... It's so bright.

331
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:11,242
I didn't mean to drop them
under there.

332
00:24:11,316 --> 00:24:14,877
I gotta... I gotta piss, man.

333
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:17,717
Aah! God damn!

334
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:19,950
What the hell?

335
00:24:21,526 --> 00:24:23,016
Morning, boys.

336
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:27,026
Nothing like a good
night's sleep, huh?

337
00:24:27,098 --> 00:24:29,532
These headlights
are giving me a headache.

338
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:31,535
But you give me a day or two,

339
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:34,367
I'll have it fixed up
once and for all and forever.

340
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:36,202
That's how Mike does it.

341
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:39,869
Once and all and for... forever.

342
00:24:39,945 --> 00:24:43,403
Wait. Look at this,
look at this, look at this.

343
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:46,076
Looks like you owe me
first beer of the day.

344
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:54,549
I told you, man. No one can fix
the headlights in this car.

345
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:02,525
You asleep?

346
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:05,500
Yeah, man, I'm asleep.

347
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:08,232
You're missing a lot of beautiful shit.

348
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:16,679
Can't believe you lost my shades.

349
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:29,884
Holy shit.

350
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:36,262
Oh, geez!

351
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:38,131
What the... Wait. What... Oh...

352
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:41,695
Eugene, what?

353
00:25:41,773 --> 00:25:42,933
What?

354
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:47,245
Afternoon, lady.

355
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:49,746
Where you guys going?

356
00:25:49,814 --> 00:25:51,441
East-ish.

357
00:25:51,516 --> 00:25:52,847
East-ish?

358
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:58,588
You guys don't have any clue
where you're going, do you?

359
00:25:58,657 --> 00:26:00,818
Well, you haven't been here very long, right?

360
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:02,883
Why's that?

361
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:06,124
'Cause if anybody here had a clue,
we wouldn't be here in the first place.

362
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:09,767
True.

363
00:26:09,834 --> 00:26:12,428
I am pretty new.

364
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:16,804
Actually, I've been hitchhiking
ever since I got here.

365
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:18,137
How come?

366
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:20,769
Because I'm looking
for the people in charge.

367
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:22,608
- People in charge?
- Yeah.

368
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:25,115
Just where do you think you are?

369
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:28,685
Some kind of country club

370
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:31,813
where you can just walk
into the main office?

371
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:34,051
Tell me, please,
when you were still living,

372
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:35,956
did you ever try to go looking for God?

373
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:39,890
No. But I really didn't have
any reason to back then.

374
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:41,762
And what reason do you have now?

375
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:44,859
I mean, you know,
are you just sorry you offed?

376
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:47,097
You, uh, changed your mind?

377
00:26:47,172 --> 00:26:49,037
Because, you know, if that's the case,

378
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:50,699
and you're just waiting
for visa back home...

379
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:52,834
- Eugene, Eugene, Eugene.
- What? What?

380
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:54,173
What's your name?

381
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:55,837
Mikal.

382
00:26:55,914 --> 00:26:57,575
- What's your name?
- Zia.

383
00:26:57,649 --> 00:26:59,583
- Eugene.
- Nice to meet you.

384
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:02,518
- Nice to meet you.
- Thanks.

385
00:27:02,587 --> 00:27:04,282
So you're trying to leave?

386
00:27:04,356 --> 00:27:05,789
You don't like it here?

387
00:27:05,857 --> 00:27:07,484
Are you joking?

388
00:27:08,693 --> 00:27:12,151
Do you guys like it here?

389
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:15,927
Who the hell likes being stuck in a place
where you can't even smile?

390
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:18,629
It's hot as balls. Everybody's an asshole.

391
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:21,636
I just want to go home.

392
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:33,574
- I don't know.
- I like it.

393
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,779
Yeah, better than sleeping
in the car, man.

394
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:37,082
All right.

395
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:39,487
I'll go get the cashier.

396
00:27:42,427 --> 00:27:45,419
I like that it has a window right here.

397
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:47,397
It's nice.

398
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:52,232
You want to try it out?

399
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:54,032
What do you mean?

400
00:27:54,105 --> 00:27:56,335
You know what I mean.

401
00:27:56,408 --> 00:27:58,968
I think I'm gonna go
see how Zia's doing.

402
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:36,739
I wonder if people who die normally
end up with no stars.

403
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:39,079
I really miss the stars.

404
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:42,116
You get used to it.

405
00:28:43,154 --> 00:28:45,816
I don't want to get used to it.
I want to go home.

406
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:50,052
This guy who gave me
a ride the other day,

407
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:52,756
he said that he actually heard rumors
about the people in charge.

408
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:54,822
Um, apparently they wear
white outfits or something.

409
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:57,800
That's a crock of shit... white outfits.

410
00:28:57,869 --> 00:28:59,962
He was just trying to get into your pants.

411
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:02,802
No, he wasn't.

412
00:29:02,874 --> 00:29:04,808
He said he thought I had a really good case.

413
00:29:04,876 --> 00:29:07,037
Oh, and what makes
your case so special,

414
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:09,273
if you don't mind me asking?

415
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:11,577
That I got here by mistake.

416
00:29:12,717 --> 00:29:16,813
Well, we all got here by some mistake
one way or another.

417
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:18,822
And believe me,
you have as much chance

418
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:22,951
at finding your folks in white
as Zia has to find his dead princess.

419
00:29:23,027 --> 00:29:24,688
You don't know that.

420
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:27,698
No, you don't. I bet he'll find her.

421
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:31,327
Yeah. Besides, I got a hunch
she's not that far away.

422
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,629
Wherever she is,

423
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:37,504
I bet she found someone by now.

424
00:29:37,575 --> 00:29:41,409
Probably some black guy
who hanged himself by his dick.

425
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:43,811
It wouldn't matter, Eugene.

426
00:29:55,193 --> 00:29:57,661
You know, I was thinking.

427
00:29:57,729 --> 00:29:59,993
Yeah?

428
00:30:00,064 --> 00:30:03,227
If you were to ever cheat on me...

429
00:30:05,837 --> 00:30:08,567
make sure you do it
with somebody who's really pretty.

430
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,575
What are you...
What are you talking about?

431
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,668
I'm not gonna cheat on you.
Why do you say that?

432
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:15,736
I know, baby.

433
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:57,979
Hey, Eugene, do you mind if I drive?

434
00:30:58,056 --> 00:30:59,648
I'll get us there in half the time.

435
00:30:59,724 --> 00:31:01,248
Get us where?

436
00:31:03,261 --> 00:31:05,161
Over there.

437
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:09,328
Oh, there.

438
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,391
All right, then.

439
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:18,106
I'm not sitting in the back.

440
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:20,474
Why not?

441
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:23,207
'Cause everybody knows
guy in the back seat doesn't have a cock.

442
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:26,308
- What?
- That's a fact.

443
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:28,352
If the guy in the back seat
had a cock,

444
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:30,182
he wouldn't be back there
in the first place.

445
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:35,017
Well, l... I mean, I got a cock, man.

446
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:36,924
So how can... I'm not...

447
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:39,020
Mik, do you have a cock?

448
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:40,792
Yeah, I have a cock.

449
00:31:40,865 --> 00:31:42,492
A big fat one.

450
00:32:02,387 --> 00:32:04,287
I'm looking for the people in charge

451
00:32:04,355 --> 00:32:05,447
because I'm here by mistake.

452
00:32:05,523 --> 00:32:06,888
I'm not supposed to be here.

453
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:09,756
I've been looking for a while.

454
00:32:09,827 --> 00:32:12,125
I'm looking for a girl named Desiree.

455
00:32:12,196 --> 00:32:13,959
Short blonde hair,
about this tall.

456
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:17,263
I'm not sure what you're
trying to accomplish is completely legal.

457
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:19,394
- Well, that's very...
- Can I see some I. D?

458
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:21,301
We're looking for the people in charge
of this place

459
00:32:21,372 --> 00:32:22,862
because I've only been
here a couple weeks

460
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,033
and I got here by mistake.

461
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:25,973
Did I show you...

462
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:28,376
Thanks, "Ociffer," but we...

463
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:29,913
The people in charge.

464
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:31,243
- <i>Nyet,</i> Mom.
- P. I.C.

465
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:33,750
About this tall.

466
00:32:33,818 --> 00:32:35,752
Her name's Desiree. She's really pretty.

467
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,838
When there's a trap

468
00:32:57,909 --> 00:32:59,706
Set up for you

469
00:32:59,777 --> 00:33:04,043
In every corner of your room

470
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:07,210
And so

471
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:09,845
The only way to go

472
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:11,684
Is

473
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:13,951
Through the roof

474
00:33:18,596 --> 00:33:21,622
Through the roof

475
00:33:21,699 --> 00:33:24,668
Underground

476
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:31,137
Through the roof

477
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:34,474
Underground

478
00:33:34,545 --> 00:33:38,948
And as we crossing border after border

479
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:42,509
We realize the differences now

480
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:46,687
It's underdogs who

481
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:48,692
And if you want it, too

482
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:53,459
You'll always have to make your own fun

483
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:58,661
Hey, man, you need
to wipe these off for me.

484
00:33:58,736 --> 00:34:03,332
# The local cultures
are dying and dying #

485
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:06,673
# The product growers
are buying and buying #

486
00:34:06,744 --> 00:34:09,008
Man, are you doing that
intentionally to hurt me?

487
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,945
No. No. It's... It's not my fault.

488
00:34:11,015 --> 00:34:12,482
I just wanted you to clean those off.

489
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,415
- I know. I was cleaning.
- That's a hole. I told you.

490
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:16,248
You want to see if my hat
drops down the hole?

491
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,083
No, I'm not gonna
drop your hat in the hole!

492
00:34:18,156 --> 00:34:19,646
Guys, guys, guys, guys!

493
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:21,658
Here's my tobacco.
See if that goes down.

494
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:24,251
Guys, guys, please stop bickering.

495
00:34:24,328 --> 00:34:26,319
Please?

496
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:28,592
Eugene, there's a diner right there.
Will you stop?

497
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:30,190
Good. Perf... Perfect timing.

498
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:32,293
And you, don't touch my stuff no more.

499
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:35,032
- You handed me the shades, man.
- Don't touch my stuff no more.

500
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:42,176
Yes, Mama.

501
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:46,315
Didn't he already talk
to his mom this morning?

502
00:34:46,384 --> 00:34:49,876
Yeah, but, supposedly,
that's, uh, normal in Russia.

503
00:34:52,623 --> 00:34:54,716
I don't think that's normal anywhere.

504
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:56,225
Yeah, I know.

505
00:34:56,294 --> 00:34:58,990
I'm gonna go get some smokes.
Do you want anything?

506
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,305
Next time you grab my ass,

507
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:13,309
I'm going to tell your mom, asshole, okay?

508
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:15,208
Okay?

509
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:45,039
All I'm saying is neither of us
have scored with her, you know?

510
00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:47,202
I don't know about that.

511
00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:50,907
The other night, uh, she said
she thought you were cute.

512
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,813
Cute?

513
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:55,375
That's what they say about a puppy.

514
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:58,684
The only thing worse
is "good friend" or "nice person."

515
00:35:58,756 --> 00:36:01,224
In plain English it means
"I'll leech off you as long as I can,

516
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:04,193
but don't even think
about getting into my pants."

517
00:36:04,262 --> 00:36:06,127
Yeah, well, you might be right about that.

518
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:09,530
Of course I'm right.
I say we get rid of her while we still can.

519
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,692
I mean, look.

520
00:36:10,768 --> 00:36:13,601
Look at what we're losing out on
because of her.

521
00:36:16,607 --> 00:36:18,268
Yeah, I don't know.

522
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:20,606
The whole "people in charge" thing
is a little weird.

523
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:22,805
See? That's what I'm talking about.

524
00:36:29,453 --> 00:36:30,579
Shoot.

525
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:33,488
Look, fuck her, man.

526
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:35,150
Okay? That's what I'm talking about.

527
00:36:35,226 --> 00:36:36,750
She's eavesdropping
on her friends now.

528
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:32,114
Where'd you get those shades?

529
00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:33,912
What shades?

530
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:39,756
Mikal bought us shades, man.

531
00:37:48,499 --> 00:37:50,262
Sweet of her.

532
00:37:50,334 --> 00:37:52,598
But it is good to be on our own, you know?

533
00:37:55,873 --> 00:37:57,807
Eugene, you know, I love you, man,

534
00:37:57,875 --> 00:37:59,502
but you can be an asshole.

535
00:37:59,577 --> 00:38:02,205
What do you care?

536
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,214
We're looking for Irene, right?

537
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:05,977
Yeah, we're looking for Irene.

538
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:08,177
All right. Then let's look for Irene.

539
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:38,443
Okay, just calm down.

540
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:40,848
If you just comply,
everything's gonna be just fine.

541
00:38:40,918 --> 00:38:42,545
On what charges?

542
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:44,713
Breaking that sign is
a clear case of vandalism.

543
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:45,915
That's absolutely retarded.

544
00:38:46,057 --> 00:38:47,046
- You're handcuffing me, too?
- Yes.

545
00:38:47,124 --> 00:38:48,216
Are you serious?

546
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:50,522
Yes, I'm placing you under arrest.
Hands behind your back.

547
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:53,493
I was just trying to make this place

548
00:38:53,564 --> 00:38:54,929
a little bit less depressing.

549
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:56,466
What's the big deal with that?
This is so dramatic.

550
00:38:56,534 --> 00:38:58,126
You don't even need to be doing this.

551
00:38:58,202 --> 00:39:00,102
- No. Wait, Officer.
- What the hell is your problem?

552
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,399
That's my sister. What's going on?

553
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,304
Your sister?

554
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:05,865
Yeah, yeah. What's going on?

555
00:39:05,943 --> 00:39:07,934
I'm afraid your sister's been arrested.

556
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:09,536
Arrested?

557
00:39:09,613 --> 00:39:12,343
Wait. Can I talk to you for a minute?

558
00:39:13,984 --> 00:39:15,679
What have you got to say?

559
00:39:16,787 --> 00:39:19,221
l... I mean, she's only
been here a few mo...

560
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:22,350
- You know, how long you been here?
- Some time.

561
00:39:22,426 --> 00:39:24,951
First of all, she just got here.

562
00:39:29,767 --> 00:39:32,531
Well, you remember what it's like
those first couple months, right?

563
00:39:32,603 --> 00:39:35,128
I mean, the no-smiling thing's
really getting to her.

564
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,436
Nobody's got any good humor
or anything like that.

565
00:40:09,273 --> 00:40:11,764
Well, I can turn
my head away this once.

566
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:13,673
Yeah?

567
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:16,804
Ma'am, you better watch your behavior.

568
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:19,111
You bet, Officer.

569
00:40:23,053 --> 00:40:24,714
You didn't have to do that.

570
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,891
Thank you.

571
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:41,932
What are you... You gonna...

572
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:47,573
Can we still give you a ride?

573
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:50,375
No, thanks. I think I'm headed
the other way.

574
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:53,247
Listen, l...

575
00:40:53,317 --> 00:40:56,718
I'm sorry about all that back there.

576
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:58,550
It's...

577
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:01,182
We didn't mean that.
It's just Eugene's venting.

578
00:41:01,258 --> 00:41:02,816
That's okay.

579
00:41:02,893 --> 00:41:05,327
Doesn't matter.

580
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:08,359
I just want to...

581
00:41:08,432 --> 00:41:09,797
We don't...
We don't mean that.

582
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:11,494
You know what?
It's probably gonna be hard

583
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:13,969
for me to get a ride
with you standing there, so...

584
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:21,503
Yeah. Probably right.

585
00:41:22,613 --> 00:41:24,604
I hope you find what you're looking for.

586
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:25,774
Thank you.

587
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:28,580
I really do.

588
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:44,157
- Where were you, man?
- Guess who I just saw.

589
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:45,167
Who?

590
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:47,101
Mikal. She's right back there.

591
00:41:49,073 --> 00:41:51,234
What the fuck was that?

592
00:41:51,308 --> 00:41:53,401
Oh, man. You didn't
take out the nozzle?

593
00:41:54,979 --> 00:41:57,004
You deal with this guy. I'm not into it.

594
00:41:57,081 --> 00:41:58,173
What?

595
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,707
I'm sorry again.

596
00:42:00,784 --> 00:42:04,276
Oh, it happens all the time.

597
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:06,755
At least twice a week.

598
00:42:06,824 --> 00:42:09,657
- Really?
- It happens. See?

599
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:12,992
All these are already filled out.

600
00:42:16,133 --> 00:42:17,122
Right here.

601
00:42:22,506 --> 00:42:25,100
What's this here about, uh,

602
00:42:25,175 --> 00:42:29,373
"What were you thinking
when the incident occurred?"

603
00:42:29,446 --> 00:42:31,243
Exactly that.

604
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:54,704
Here I am again, buried in debt.

605
00:42:54,772 --> 00:42:57,002
If pulling the trigger
didn't solve my problems,

606
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:59,008
what the hell will?

607
00:43:01,278 --> 00:43:05,009
I was wondering if I
was too drunk to drive.

608
00:43:20,731 --> 00:43:23,325
But the problem with you
is that you don't think it's fucked up

609
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,368
- to talk shit about me when I'm not there.
- I was kidding.

610
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:27,336
You were kidding?
You didn't know I was listening.

611
00:43:27,404 --> 00:43:29,736
No, I didn't.
That's eavesdropping.

612
00:43:29,807 --> 00:43:31,570
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Whatever.

613
00:43:31,642 --> 00:43:33,507
- Look, I found...
- Calm down, man.

614
00:43:33,577 --> 00:43:35,010
- Look at this.
- Calm down. Relax.

615
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:36,512
It's her phone number. It's Desiree.

616
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,844
It's her phone number, her address,
everything. Look at that.

617
00:43:38,916 --> 00:43:43,182
I spaced out because the man at pump 3
looked just like my ex-boyfriend.

618
00:43:43,253 --> 00:43:45,187
Where is he?

619
00:43:45,255 --> 00:43:47,086
He feels so close.

620
00:43:47,157 --> 00:43:50,820
I knew she was close, man.
I told you, man. I felt it.

621
00:43:50,894 --> 00:43:53,920
All right. What do you want to do?
You want to call her?

622
00:43:53,998 --> 00:43:55,124
No, let's go over there.

623
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:57,759
That guy said it's
not very far from here.

624
00:43:57,835 --> 00:44:00,565
Let's go, man. Let's go!
I told you, man.

625
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:03,232
You should buy her
some flowers at least.

626
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:07,068
Flowers would be nice, but l... l...

627
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:09,203
did you see the flowers in there?

628
00:44:09,279 --> 00:44:11,509
Yeah.
