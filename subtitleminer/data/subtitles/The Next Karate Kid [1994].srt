00:01:48,867 --> 00:01:49,933
Good to see you also.

2
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,800
Ah, Louisa, beautiful Louisa.

3
00:02:27,867 --> 00:02:32,133
Although many of our families
were locked up in internment camps...

4
00:02:32,133 --> 00:02:36,267
we Japanese-Americans fought valiantly
for our country in World War Two.

5
00:02:37,733 --> 00:02:41,333
<i>We forged a special bond of friendship
with our white officers...</i>

6
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:44,333
<i>realizing that all of us
believed in the ideals...</i>

7
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:46,933
<i>....that forged our country.</i>

8
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:49,333
<i>In battles in Italy and France...</i>

9
00:02:50,133 --> 00:02:54,933
<i>we became one of the most decorated
army units in World War Two.</i>

10
00:02:55,933 --> 00:03:00,000
Today, the President
of the United States honors us...

11
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,267
...with a special unit citation.

12
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,533
<i>The citation will be accepted
on our behalf...</i>

13
00:03:05,533 --> 00:03:10,600
<i>...by Sergeant Ketsuke Miyagi
and Mrs. Louisa Pierce...</i>

14
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,733
<i>...the widow of Lieutenant Jack Pierce.</i>

15
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:18,333
These men were legendary soldiers
in a regiment of heroes.

16
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:21,200
Attention!

17
00:03:23,267 --> 00:03:25,933
Guard! Colors.

18
00:03:25,933 --> 00:03:29,133
Attention!

19
00:03:55,733 --> 00:03:58,533
- More potatoes, Mr. Miyagi?
- No, thank you, Louisa-san.

20
00:03:58,533 --> 00:04:00,933
Miyagi is rice man, remember?

21
00:04:06,267 --> 00:04:09,733
I am so sorry that my granddaughter's
not here to meet you.

22
00:04:09,733 --> 00:04:11,933
I don't know where she can be.

23
00:04:13,933 --> 00:04:17,933
Julie! This is Mr. Miyagi.
He was a friend of your grandfather.

24
00:04:22,267 --> 00:04:23,600
Hi.

25
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,400
Please excuse me for a moment.

26
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,733
Julie, I want you to come out
and meet Mr. Miyagi.

27
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:37,933
- I did. I said "hi."
- I want you to talk to him.

28
00:04:37,933 --> 00:04:39,533
You invited him here.
You talk to him.

29
00:04:39,533 --> 00:04:41,533
- What are you doing?
- Getting some meat.

30
00:04:41,533 --> 00:04:43,467
- Why?
- It's for a friend.

31
00:04:43,467 --> 00:04:45,667
May I ask which friend?

32
00:04:45,667 --> 00:04:49,867
Why is it, whenever I come back here,
I feel like I am in a police station.

33
00:04:49,867 --> 00:04:51,533
I am surprised you don't take
my fingerprints.

34
00:04:51,533 --> 00:04:55,267
I worry about you, that's all.
You have got to tell me what you want.

35
00:04:55,267 --> 00:04:58,067
What I want is for you
to leave me alone!

36
00:04:58,067 --> 00:05:00,333
Where are you going?
Susan!

37
00:05:03,267 --> 00:05:06,533
My name is Julie.
My mother's name was Susan.

38
00:05:06,533 --> 00:05:09,800
She was killed in a car accident
with my father, and they're both dead.

39
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,000
So stop trying to bring them back.

40
00:05:16,933 --> 00:05:21,867
I am sorry you had to see that.
She is always so very angry.

41
00:05:21,867 --> 00:05:24,133
Anybody who lose parent...

42
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,467
....have much grief.

43
00:05:28,467 --> 00:05:32,467
Grief trapped in the heart
become big anger.

44
00:05:33,467 --> 00:05:35,333
I don't know what to do anymore.

45
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:37,333
Have suggestion.

46
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,533
Suggest Louisa-san...

47
00:05:49,533 --> 00:05:51,800
....water flowers.

48
00:05:53,533 --> 00:05:55,600
What do you mean, flowers?

49
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,067
Not here flower.

50
00:05:58,067 --> 00:06:01,733
Flower in Miyagi garden.
California.

51
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,067
Hi, Angel.

52
00:06:55,933 --> 00:06:56,683
Hi.

53
00:07:01,467 --> 00:07:03,600
How you doing, huh?

54
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:08,400
How's your wing?
Does it feel any better?

55
00:07:09,533 --> 00:07:12,800
Come here. Can you come to me?
Come here, hop to my hand.

56
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:17,133
Good girl.
Let's go for a walk, okay?

57
00:07:17,133 --> 00:07:18,733
Come on.

58
00:07:21,133 --> 00:07:24,333
I got in another argument
with my grandmother tonight.

59
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:27,667
I wish my parents were still here.

60
00:07:29,667 --> 00:07:32,267
Everything wouldn't be
so messed up.

61
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,000
You know...

62
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,933
if they found out you were here,
they'd take you away.

63
00:07:41,933 --> 00:07:46,133
Wouldn't that be awful?
In some small cage.

64
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:48,133
You wouldn't know anybody.

65
00:07:55,467 --> 00:07:58,933
<i>- 544, handle code two.
- We're checking it out.</i>

66
00:08:00,267 --> 00:08:03,733
Larry, look at that,
up on the roof.

67
00:08:07,667 --> 00:08:10,133
If she hasn't jumped yet,
I am going to throw her.

68
00:08:10,133 --> 00:08:12,533
I will be back.
You be quiet, okay?

69
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:14,133
You be quiet.

70
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:23,067
- You all right?
- Yeah, I am fine.

71
00:08:29,067 --> 00:08:32,067
- You think she's still up here?
- Beats me.

72
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,267
- What was that?
- Look out!

73
00:08:36,867 --> 00:08:39,133
You! Hold it right there!

74
00:08:39,133 --> 00:08:41,533
I said hold it!
Police!

75
00:08:58,467 --> 00:08:59,717
Stop!

76
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,600
Oh, come on!

77
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,267
Look, I have heard all this before.

78
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:22,733
Why don't you put it on a video so I can
fast-forward through the familiar parts?

79
00:09:22,733 --> 00:09:27,067
I love you, Julie,
and I know you love me.

80
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:30,933
But these days,
we act as if we hate each other.

81
00:09:30,933 --> 00:09:35,133
Talking doesn't seem to help.
It just makes things worse.

82
00:09:35,133 --> 00:09:39,400
Mr. Miyagi's invited me to spend
some time at his house in California.

83
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,600
He will stay here and take care of
everything while I am gone.

84
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:57,267
<i>This zone is for the immediate loading
and unloading of passengers only.</i>

85
00:09:57,267 --> 00:09:58,933
<i>No parking.</i>

86
00:09:58,933 --> 00:10:02,467
<i>Please do not leave
any baggage unattended.</i>

87
00:10:06,067 --> 00:10:09,467
- Skycap! Here.
- Yes, sir?

88
00:10:11,133 --> 00:10:13,267
I have tried sometimes...

89
00:10:13,267 --> 00:10:16,067
Just to talk to you
and not get angry...

90
00:10:16,067 --> 00:10:18,600
but everything gets messed up,
and I don't know why.

91
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,333
Things get messed up for me too.

92
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,533
Bye.

93
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,733
Grandmother barely on plane...

94
00:10:35,733 --> 00:10:37,667
miss you already.

95
00:10:39,467 --> 00:10:42,133
My birthday's in a couple of weeks.
I guess she forgot.

96
00:10:43,133 --> 00:10:45,067
Birthday.

97
00:10:45,067 --> 00:10:49,467
Very special day.
Everybody have birthday.

98
00:10:49,467 --> 00:10:53,800
Miyagi make you
special dinner, okay?

99
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:58,200
Tempura. Tempura, sukiyaki.
You like?

100
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,067
No like. Okay.

101
00:11:01,067 --> 00:11:04,267
Sushi.
Sushi, sashimi. Huh?

102
00:11:04,267 --> 00:11:06,667
Sashimi. No. Okay.

103
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:12,333
Miyagi have it.
Hamburger teriyaki with French fry.

104
00:11:13,533 --> 00:11:17,800
Look, I don't need a special dinner.
I can take care of myself.

105
00:11:19,733 --> 00:11:22,067
- I know where I am going.
- Good.

106
00:11:22,067 --> 00:11:26,400
Miyagi know where you're going too.
Going school.

107
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,400
Miyagi pick you up here this afternoon.
Okay, Julie-san?

108
00:12:19,733 --> 00:12:22,000
Hey, get to class.
Get going.

109
00:12:24,267 --> 00:12:27,467
Get to class.
Let's go.

110
00:12:39,733 --> 00:12:43,867
Morning, Julie. No, no, no.
Those are bad for your ears.

111
00:12:43,867 --> 00:12:45,267
Go to hell, Ned.

112
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:48,333
Now, I could take you down
to the principal's office...

113
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:50,333
....and get you into a little trouble.

114
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:54,333
Or, I could pick you up tomorrow night
and take you down to the docks.

115
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:58,067
You have been to the docks, haven't you,
Julie? Pretty girl like you.

116
00:12:58,067 --> 00:12:59,800
Dream on.

117
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:05,200
Hey! Most girls in this school
invite me.

118
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,867
Now, you're lucky
to get an invitation.

119
00:13:07,867 --> 00:13:10,800
Now, come on, Julie.
You know it's going to happen.

120
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,400
Let go of me!

121
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,933
Start hanging out
with me and my friends...

122
00:13:14,933 --> 00:13:18,000
you can have any damn thing
that you want.

123
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,133
- Let go of me.
- What's going on, Ned?

124
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:22,333
Colonel Dugan, sir.

125
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:24,533
I caught this young lady
smoking cigarettes.

126
00:13:24,533 --> 00:13:26,667
What are you talking about?
I wasn't smoking.

127
00:13:26,667 --> 00:13:30,533
Her name is Julie Pierce, sir.

128
00:13:32,133 --> 00:13:34,600
To the office. Let's go.

129
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,533
Curb your dog.

130
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:37,933
A member of the Alpha Elite caught
this student smoking in the greenhouse.

131
00:13:37,933 --> 00:13:42,333
A member of the Alpha Elite caught
this student smoking in the greenhouse.

132
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:45,000
Put her record
in the center file.

133
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,133
If this student screws up again,
I want her out of here.

134
00:13:49,133 --> 00:13:52,867
Of course, it depends
on which rule she breaks.

135
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,067
No second chances.
Next time, that's it.

136
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,933
- I agree.
- All right, young lady...

137
00:14:03,933 --> 00:14:05,867
you have been warned.

138
00:14:06,867 --> 00:14:09,467
Now get to your next class.

139
00:14:09,467 --> 00:14:12,067
It's a big school.
I might get lost on the way.

140
00:14:12,067 --> 00:14:16,200
McGowen, take this student
to her next class. Room 238.

141
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,333
Hey, I am Eric.
What's your name?

142
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:26,467
Go to hell.

143
00:14:26,467 --> 00:14:30,133
"Go to hell." That's a funny name.
Is it Chinese?

144
00:14:30,133 --> 00:14:34,067
Don't strain yourself. You're just
another jerk working for Colonel Dugan.

145
00:14:34,067 --> 00:14:36,933
So, you got a problem with that?

146
00:14:36,933 --> 00:14:39,333
Hang out with morons,
and you catch their stupidity.

147
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:42,733
The Alpha Elite--
it's like a championship football team.

148
00:14:42,733 --> 00:14:44,133
That's what this school's known for.

149
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:47,867
Right.
And you believe everything you hear?

150
00:14:48,933 --> 00:14:50,933
I don't believe your name is
"go to hell."

151
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,267
See you later.

152
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,933
- McGowen, right?
- Yeah.

153
00:15:15,933 --> 00:15:19,267
Colonel Dugan told me you took
Julie Pierce to her next class.

154
00:15:19,267 --> 00:15:21,933
- Any problems?
- No.

155
00:15:21,933 --> 00:15:23,867
No? Good.

156
00:15:24,533 --> 00:15:26,533
Don't forget, she's mine.

157
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Anybody home?

158
00:15:59,733 --> 00:16:02,267
It's okay. It's okay.

159
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:09,333
How's the wing, huh?
Does it feel any better?

160
00:16:11,267 --> 00:16:13,067
Don't worry.

161
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:18,200
- What are you doing up here?
- Where'd you get the hawk?

162
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,600
She got shot in the wing.
I found her on the grass near the gym.

163
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,333
- Does it bite?
- Yeah.

164
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:25,667
Yeah, so stay back.

165
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,333
So, what is this place?

166
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:35,267
One of the janitors
used to keep pigeons up here.

167
00:16:35,267 --> 00:16:39,667
Yeah? It's pretty cool.
You got your own private little zoo.

168
00:16:39,667 --> 00:16:42,933
- This is my secret, all right?
- Well, not anymore.

169
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:49,867
- What do you mean?
- What do I mean? What do I mean?

170
00:16:49,867 --> 00:16:51,867
You tell anybody about this,
and you're going to be in trouble.

171
00:16:51,867 --> 00:16:55,533
- What kind of trouble?
- Well, I will--

172
00:16:55,533 --> 00:16:57,400
- I will call Domino's Pizza.
- Yeah?

173
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,933
I will have them deliver 48 pizzas
in the middle of the night.

174
00:16:59,933 --> 00:17:02,867
That's great. I love pizza.
No anchovies, okay?

175
00:17:02,867 --> 00:17:05,333
I will write your name
all over the girls' bathroom.

176
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:10,067
I will tell everyone you have
some weird social disease.

177
00:17:10,067 --> 00:17:12,467
I guess I am going to be
pretty popular then, huh?

178
00:17:13,667 --> 00:17:15,467
- You have a car?
- Yeah.

179
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:18,000
How would you like a pound of sugar
poured down the gas tank?

180
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,333
- You're kind of angry, aren't you?
- Yes!

181
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:24,133
- I like that.
- What are you going to do about Angel?

182
00:17:26,867 --> 00:17:28,467
So, what are you going to do?

183
00:17:28,467 --> 00:17:29,733
You will see.

184
00:17:32,667 --> 00:17:36,000
In the past,
we have had external enemies.

185
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,133
Now the enemy is in our country.

186
00:17:40,133 --> 00:17:44,400
It's inside our cities,
in our schools.

187
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,667
In a war, you have to be
ready and able to destroy your enemy.

188
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:52,000
Your school is clean and orderly...

189
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,333
because you are ready and able
to give a maximum response.

190
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:59,933
Some punk brings spray paint,
puts graffiti on our walls...

191
00:17:59,933 --> 00:18:02,933
we spray paint his eyeballs
so that he sees red.

192
00:18:02,933 --> 00:18:06,067
Some kid drops a candy wrapper...

193
00:18:06,067 --> 00:18:08,267
you make him pick it up and eat it.

194
00:18:08,267 --> 00:18:10,867
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, sir!

195
00:18:10,867 --> 00:18:15,133
Are you ready and able to give
a maximum response?

196
00:18:15,133 --> 00:18:17,533
A maximum effort?
To go to the limit?

197
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,600
All right.

198
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:25,067
Now, this is a bullring,
and I am the bull.

199
00:18:25,067 --> 00:18:28,000
My objective is to defend.

200
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,333
Your objective is to attack......

201
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,000
....so take your best shot.

202
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,333
Does that mean anything goes,
Colonel Dugan?

203
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:37,600
Try whatever you'd like.

204
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,667
I got him. Hit him.

205
00:19:02,667 --> 00:19:04,267
- Very good, Ned.
- Sir!

206
00:19:07,133 --> 00:19:08,333
Where is McGowen?

207
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,933
McGowen, get out here.

208
00:19:16,067 --> 00:19:17,267
You have a problem?

209
00:19:18,933 --> 00:19:22,333
No, I don't. I will fight for my family,
I will fight for myself...

210
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:24,867
but I am not going to step in there just
so you can show me how tough you are.

211
00:19:24,867 --> 00:19:28,067
Maybe you should fight
out of anger then.

212
00:19:31,933 --> 00:19:34,600
Yes!
Now that's more like it.

213
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,533
That's what I like to see.

214
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,333
Get back.

215
00:19:43,533 --> 00:19:46,200
I guess that made you feel
like a man, huh?

216
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,400
Did you feel pretty good?

217
00:19:49,867 --> 00:19:52,600
When the enemy is weakest,
that's when you destroy them.

218
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,800
Excuse me.

219
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,133
Looking for student
named Julie Pierce.

220
00:19:58,133 --> 00:20:00,267
Who the hell are you?

221
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:05,867
My name Miyagi.
Friend of student grandmother.

222
00:20:07,867 --> 00:20:10,333
I don't care if you're a friend
of the pope.

223
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,267
You're trespassing.

224
00:20:12,267 --> 00:20:15,067
Now get your butt off school property.

225
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:20,333
- Boy, you okay?
- Yeah, I am all right.

226
00:20:21,867 --> 00:20:25,533
What are you all gawking at?
Let's do some laps. Come on!

227
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,200
I told you to leave.

228
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,933
Do you have a problem
with your hearing?

229
00:20:39,933 --> 00:20:41,600
No, hearing okay.

230
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,867
Then it must a problem with this
old body of yours getting rickety.

231
00:20:44,867 --> 00:20:49,600
- You don't move very fast.
- Move fast enough when necessary.

232
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,267
I told you to leave.

233
00:20:51,267 --> 00:20:56,067
Miyagi raised in small village...

234
00:20:56,067 --> 00:20:58,800
....on Okinawa.

235
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,733
At that time...

236
00:21:00,733 --> 00:21:03,000
....was a very bad-tempered bull...

237
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,467
...live in a pasture near village.

238
00:21:05,467 --> 00:21:08,467
Bull very bad. He chase children...

239
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:11,600
....woman going shopping, farmer, everybody.

240
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,867
Then, one day, big festival.

241
00:21:15,867 --> 00:21:17,867
Everybody happy.

242
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:26,267
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

243
00:21:29,867 --> 00:21:34,133
That day,
bad bull become good soup.

244
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:44,800
- Did you tell Dugan about the hawk?
- You stayed after school to ask me that?

245
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,533
If anyone finds out about Angel,
they're going to take her away.

246
00:21:47,533 --> 00:21:48,800
Is that what you call her-- Angel?

247
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:52,333
- How do you know she's a girl?
- Will you just answer the question?

248
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:54,000
I am sorry.
I have to go.

249
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,467
Well, I am not getting out of this car
until you tell me what you're going to do.

250
00:21:58,467 --> 00:22:00,333
Fine. Have it your way.

251
00:22:03,133 --> 00:22:05,067
Do you like my car?

252
00:22:05,067 --> 00:22:08,867
It's an Oldsmobile 442.
I saved it from the junkyard.

253
00:22:09,933 --> 00:22:13,533
- It's just a car.
- "It's just a car"?

254
00:22:13,533 --> 00:22:16,067
Does Michael Jordan
Just play basketball?

255
00:22:16,067 --> 00:22:18,000
Is Wayne Gretzky
Just a hockey player?

256
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,533
I don't know. Is he?

257
00:22:19,533 --> 00:22:23,267
No, he's not.
He's great, like this car.

258
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,933
- Where are you going?
- To work.

259
00:22:33,467 --> 00:22:37,333
- You're a train driver?
- Security.

260
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:41,400
- A security guard?
- Yeah, that's right.

261
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,867
You know, my grandfather, he used
to be an engineer in this train yard.

262
00:22:44,867 --> 00:22:48,133
I just chase the rats.
Come here, I want to show you something.

263
00:22:54,133 --> 00:22:56,400
From up here you could see
the top of the world.

264
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,267
Come on up.

265
00:23:11,533 --> 00:23:13,400
Why do you do this?

266
00:23:15,267 --> 00:23:17,800
Well, for the money.
What else?

267
00:23:19,133 --> 00:23:22,533
My dad walked out on us
about six years ago.

268
00:23:22,533 --> 00:23:25,667
For a while he was sending us money,
but then he just stopped.

269
00:23:25,667 --> 00:23:27,733
So, I had to get a job.

270
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:33,600
I don't know, I guess he didn't think
we were very important.

271
00:23:36,867 --> 00:23:40,333
It doesn't matter though.
This is temporary.

272
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:44,067
I am going to the Air Force Academy.
I am going to be a fighter pilot.

273
00:23:44,067 --> 00:23:46,133
Dugan said I can get in.

274
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:48,667
That's why you joined his group?

275
00:23:48,667 --> 00:23:50,800
Yeah.

276
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,333
Yep, it's a pain in the ass...

277
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:56,000
...but, hey, it will get me
in the cockpit of an F-15.

278
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,867
I never think about the future.

279
00:23:59,867 --> 00:24:04,333
Sure you do.
What are you doing next month?

280
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:06,933
Don't know.

281
00:24:06,933 --> 00:24:09,800
- What are you doing next week?
- Don't care.

282
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:13,067
What are you doing
in the next five seconds?

283
00:24:13,067 --> 00:24:15,067
I am going to make you promise me...

284
00:24:15,067 --> 00:24:17,800
...that you won't tell anybody about the hawk.

285
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,200
- Don't worry.
- Promise.

286
00:24:21,933 --> 00:24:24,267
- Look, if it's that important to you--
- Promise!

287
00:24:26,733 --> 00:24:28,200
All right.

288
00:24:29,133 --> 00:24:30,667
I promise.

289
00:24:35,467 --> 00:24:38,733
Talk to you again soon.
Bye-bye.

290
00:24:41,067 --> 00:24:43,267
Julie-san, hello.

291
00:24:48,067 --> 00:24:49,867
So, how was school today?

292
00:24:49,867 --> 00:24:52,733
What's wrong with you?
Are you crazy?

293
00:24:52,733 --> 00:24:56,400
You're supposed to knock
before you come into a girl's room!

294
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,867
Very, very sorry.
Miyagi apologize.

295
00:24:58,867 --> 00:25:00,733
Very sorry. Oh, very sorry.

296
00:25:06,533 --> 00:25:08,200
Okay, I am dressed.
You can look now.

297
00:25:11,733 --> 00:25:14,600
Miyagi apologize.
You see...

298
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:18,533
before, live with friend, Daniel-san.

299
00:25:18,533 --> 00:25:21,467
Daniel-san come Miyagi room,
Miyagi go Daniel-san room.

300
00:25:21,467 --> 00:25:25,533
No big thing.
A boy is easier.

301
00:25:25,533 --> 00:25:28,467
- Just forget about it, okay?
- Okay.

302
00:25:28,467 --> 00:25:33,000
Today, Miyagi go pick up Julie-san
at the school...

303
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,533
....but you not there.

304
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:37,733
I went to the train yard
to talk to this guy.

305
00:25:37,733 --> 00:25:40,733
- No big deal.
- Miyagi also talk to people--

306
00:25:40,733 --> 00:25:42,533
your teachers.

307
00:25:42,533 --> 00:25:45,400
Bring home homework you miss for three weeks.

308
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,467
Great.
Maybe I will do it sometime.

309
00:25:49,533 --> 00:25:51,267
Maybe do it tonight.

310
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,400
Don't order me around.

311
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,800
Is not order.
Is very small request.

312
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,533
I told you this morning,
I know where I am going in my life...

313
00:26:00,533 --> 00:26:02,733
....and I don't need any math problems
to get there.

314
00:26:06,667 --> 00:26:09,133
Ambition without the knowledge...

315
00:26:09,133 --> 00:26:12,867
....is like boat on dry land.

316
00:26:14,933 --> 00:26:16,733
Forget it, I am out of here!

317
00:26:25,467 --> 00:26:28,533
Will you just stay out of my life?
Stop telling me what to do!

318
00:26:28,533 --> 00:26:31,733
Not trying to tell you nothing.
Try teach you something.

319
00:26:31,733 --> 00:26:34,667
Teach me? Look at you!
You can't even speak English.

320
00:26:46,267 --> 00:26:48,667
- Wow, I am really sorry. Are you okay?
- I am okay.

321
00:26:48,667 --> 00:26:51,600
Are you okay?
I am really sorry.

322
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,800
She came out of nowhere, man.
I didn't even see her.

323
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,533
- You're not hurt?
- I said I was okay!

324
00:26:55,533 --> 00:26:58,533
Hey, look, I am really sorry!
Listen, man, I am really sorry.

325
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:01,933
I just got to deliver this pizza down
the road. My boss has been on my case.

326
00:27:01,933 --> 00:27:05,200
And I have been having trouble
with my-- I got to go! I am sorry!

327
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,533
Are you sure you're okay?
I got to go! I am really sorry!

328
00:27:15,267 --> 00:27:18,067
Go ahead.
Do what my grandmother does.

329
00:27:18,067 --> 00:27:20,467
Tell me I made another mistake.

330
00:27:20,467 --> 00:27:23,933
"Julie, you're so thoughtless.
Julie, you lost your temper again."

331
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,467
Julie-san, Miyagi no need say nothing.

332
00:27:28,467 --> 00:27:31,267
You're doing very nice job, thank you.

333
00:27:31,267 --> 00:27:33,267
You're not going to say anything?

334
00:27:34,333 --> 00:27:37,800
Have small question.
Where you learn that?

335
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,200
Learn what?

336
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,800
Jump into tiger position
when car almost hit you.

337
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,200
They no teach that kind of stuff
girl's gym.

338
00:27:46,067 --> 00:27:48,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

339
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,467
I just reacted.

340
00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:16,667
My father taught me karate
when I was a little girl.

341
00:28:18,267 --> 00:28:21,067
We used to do it every night
after school.

342
00:28:21,067 --> 00:28:23,467
I thought it was a game.

343
00:28:23,467 --> 00:28:26,467
Your grandpapa...

344
00:28:26,467 --> 00:28:29,400
....save Miyagi life...

345
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,267
....long time ago.

346
00:28:32,733 --> 00:28:34,600
Was wartime.

347
00:28:35,933 --> 00:28:40,533
So, Miyagi try to say thank you...

348
00:28:40,533 --> 00:28:42,733
....teach him karate.

349
00:28:43,667 --> 00:28:45,533
He love karate.

350
00:28:47,467 --> 00:28:49,867
He teach your father.

351
00:28:49,867 --> 00:28:52,200
Your father teach you.

352
00:28:54,067 --> 00:28:56,400
And then they died.

353
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,800
Everybody died.

354
00:29:00,733 --> 00:29:03,200
Miyagi understand.

355
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,733
Miyagi also have parents at one time.

356
00:29:08,133 --> 00:29:11,000
Anger no bring them back.

357
00:29:16,267 --> 00:29:18,067
My mother was a beautiful woman.

358
00:29:18,067 --> 00:29:21,867
Whenever I watched her get dressed
for a party...

359
00:29:21,867 --> 00:29:24,667
I thought she looked
like a magical princess.

360
00:29:24,667 --> 00:29:27,067
My father loved her.

361
00:29:27,067 --> 00:29:31,467
He was wise and funny and kind.

362
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,733
It wasn't right
that they were killed.

363
00:29:38,533 --> 00:29:39,733
It wasn't fair.

364
00:29:42,133 --> 00:29:44,867
Death not fair to anyone...

365
00:29:44,867 --> 00:29:50,400
but still
we must live our lives.

366
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:53,867
I used to see them
so bright in my mind...

367
00:29:53,867 --> 00:29:55,800
so clear.

368
00:29:56,867 --> 00:29:59,133
Now all I have
are these photographs.

369
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:04,667
Julie-san, parents leave you...

370
00:30:04,667 --> 00:30:07,267
....more than just the photographs.

371
00:30:07,267 --> 00:30:10,267
Leave you with very valuable legacy.

372
00:30:11,533 --> 00:30:14,400
- What legacy?
- Karate.

373
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,933
What's so special about that?

374
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,067
Karate here.

375
00:30:23,933 --> 00:30:28,867
But, this time,
you too young to understand...

376
00:30:28,867 --> 00:30:31,067
....true value of karate.

377
00:30:32,133 --> 00:30:35,867
For once, I wish you could give me
an answer I could understand.

378
00:30:38,733 --> 00:30:41,400
Answer only important...

379
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,333
....when ask right question.

380
00:30:45,667 --> 00:30:48,467
That's exactly
what I am talking about.

381
00:31:12,333 --> 00:31:15,133
How come my makeup's
all over the bathroom?

382
00:31:15,133 --> 00:31:17,133
Too much makeup.

383
00:31:17,133 --> 00:31:18,867
What?

384
00:31:18,867 --> 00:31:21,667
Bathroom have too much makeup.

385
00:31:21,667 --> 00:31:23,667
What do you mean,
"too much makeup"?

386
00:31:23,667 --> 00:31:26,667
There's no such thing
as too much makeup.

387
00:31:26,667 --> 00:31:29,267
Julie-san,
it become problem when--

388
00:31:29,267 --> 00:31:31,667
The problem is my teeth.

389
00:31:31,667 --> 00:31:34,333
I just realized.
They don't match my nose.

390
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,400
Teeth fine, nose fine.

391
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,000
Everything fit just fine.

392
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:48,067
I have been thinking about
this karate stuff my dad taught me.

393
00:31:48,067 --> 00:31:50,133
Do you think I could still do it?
I am not real strong.

394
00:31:50,133 --> 00:31:52,267
Many kind of strength, Julie-san.

395
00:31:52,267 --> 00:31:55,733
Well, I thought maybe
you could give me a few lessons...

396
00:31:55,733 --> 00:31:59,733
so if Dugan's guys try to hassle me,
I could take care of myself.

397
00:31:59,733 --> 00:32:03,333
You want a lesson?
You pay Miyagi.

398
00:32:03,333 --> 00:32:05,867
Pay you? With what? I am broke.

399
00:32:08,133 --> 00:32:12,667
Miyagi take four homework paper
payment one karate lesson.

400
00:32:12,667 --> 00:32:15,533
- No way.
- No way, no teach.

401
00:32:15,533 --> 00:32:17,133
All right.

402
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,800
Two math papers for one lesson.

403
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,867
Two math paper, one history paper.

404
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,200
Okay. Deal.

405
00:32:28,333 --> 00:32:30,200
Let's start right now.

406
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,400
Good.
First, we wax the car.

407
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:37,267
This hand wax on,
this hand wax off. See?

408
00:32:37,267 --> 00:32:40,067
Forget it.
I am not waxing anybody's car.

409
00:32:40,067 --> 00:32:43,667
But first we wax car,
then we work engine.

410
00:32:43,667 --> 00:32:47,067
This new kind karate.
Very much fun.

411
00:32:47,067 --> 00:32:49,067
Fun? The mall is fun.

412
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:51,600
You have money for gasoline go mall?

413
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,067
I told you, I am broke.

414
00:32:54,067 --> 00:32:56,067
Then no need go mall.

415
00:32:56,067 --> 00:32:59,933
You know what? I don't think
you know anything about girls.

416
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,600
Miyagi have much to learn about girls.

417
00:33:08,667 --> 00:33:10,533
Boys easier.

418
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,667
I still want to go to the mall.

419
00:33:26,667 --> 00:33:31,067
But I thought maybe
you could loan me some money.

420
00:33:31,067 --> 00:33:33,333
No need loan money.

421
00:33:33,333 --> 00:33:36,533
Family across street have
three young boys need baby-sitter.

422
00:33:36,533 --> 00:33:39,867
Miyagi told them
you'd be very happy take job.

423
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,533
Hi, I am Julie.

424
00:33:53,933 --> 00:33:54,867
Yes!

425
00:34:00,467 --> 00:34:04,000
- What are you doing here?
- Miyagi figure...

426
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,867
children no have enough toys,
so bring more.

427
00:34:07,867 --> 00:34:11,800
Nerf balls, flying disk.

428
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,333
All kind good stuff.
You just have fun.

429
00:34:14,333 --> 00:34:17,667
"Have fun"? Mr. Miyagi,
they don't need any more toys.

430
00:34:17,667 --> 00:34:20,067
They need three
child-sized straight jackets.

431
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,067
Sun is warm, grass is green.

432
00:34:24,067 --> 00:34:25,267
What?

433
00:34:25,267 --> 00:34:29,067
If today Julie-san get angry...

434
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,467
....Just you repeat those words.

435
00:34:31,467 --> 00:34:34,667
Take deep breath in through nose.

436
00:34:34,667 --> 00:34:36,933
Sun is warm, grass is green.

437
00:34:36,933 --> 00:34:38,667
Everything work out.

438
00:34:45,733 --> 00:34:49,467
The sun is warm,
the grass is green.

439
00:34:52,533 --> 00:34:55,200
Get her! Get her!
Come on!

440
00:35:03,467 --> 00:35:05,667
Come on! Come on!

441
00:35:07,133 --> 00:35:09,000
- Move! Go!
- Got you!

442
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,000
Let's get out of here!

443
00:35:26,467 --> 00:35:29,667
You planned that whole thing.

444
00:35:29,667 --> 00:35:34,467
Baby-sitting sometime good exercise
for karate student, Julie-san.

445
00:35:34,467 --> 00:35:38,333
Well, when do I learn how to break
boards and stuff like that?

446
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:45,200
Why break boards?
What boards do to you?

447
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:50,000
That kind stuff no teach you
how to conquer anger, Julie-san.

448
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,400
- Understand?
- Yeah.

449
00:36:33,133 --> 00:36:37,267
Julie Pierce-- I knew it.
Cops said it was a girl. Let's go.

450
00:36:49,133 --> 00:36:53,267
Julie, what's going on?
Looking for an education?

451
00:36:53,267 --> 00:36:55,600
- Surprise.
- Where you going, Julie?

452
00:36:57,333 --> 00:37:00,467
- Maybe she left something in her locker.
- Let go of me!

453
00:37:04,533 --> 00:37:06,933
She's feisty, feisty.

454
00:37:12,667 --> 00:37:13,733
Get her!

455
00:37:26,467 --> 00:37:28,200
There's no way out, Julie!

456
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,267
I know you're in here, Julie.

457
00:37:39,133 --> 00:37:41,933
Come on, Julie.
I am not that bad.

458
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,800
Let's just talk.

459
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,200
Let's try to be friends, Julie.

460
00:37:57,067 --> 00:37:59,933
I hope I didn't scare you, Julie.

461
00:37:59,933 --> 00:38:01,867
I didn't mean to.

462
00:38:05,333 --> 00:38:08,267
I just want to see if we can
work out some of our differences.

463
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,467
I really don't like McGowen.

464
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:22,067
I thought maybe we can...

465
00:38:22,067 --> 00:38:24,000
....talk about that a little bit.

466
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,600
You should have let me take you to--

467
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,600
You're real pretty in the moonlight,
but this is nice.

468
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,867
Get off!

469
00:39:01,867 --> 00:39:06,467
Sometimes I like it different.
Where you going, Julie?

470
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,667
Get her, will you?

471
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,667
Come on, guys, move it!

472
00:39:29,067 --> 00:39:31,667
Don't let her
out of this courtyard!

473
00:39:31,667 --> 00:39:34,067
- Here we come, Julie!
- Get her!

474
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,133
Don't let her go!
Open the door!

475
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:44,400
I will see you at the docks.
Don't forget, we have a date.

476
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,933
Officer, I am so glad you're here.

477
00:40:05,867 --> 00:40:10,267
<i>So what you doing at school
this hour, Julie-san.... studying?</i>

478
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:14,267
I was trying to feed Angel.

479
00:40:14,267 --> 00:40:18,933
Angel.
Rather you act like angel.

480
00:40:18,933 --> 00:40:20,800
Angel's a hawk, Mr. Miyagi.

481
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,067
- Hawk?
- Yes.

482
00:40:24,067 --> 00:40:26,267
It's a long story.

483
00:40:26,267 --> 00:40:29,200
Miyagi ready to listen to long story.

484
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,133
Get in car, please.

485
00:40:36,867 --> 00:40:38,867
You're mad at me, aren't you?

486
00:40:42,467 --> 00:40:47,667
Julie-san, try to protect hawk
is okay, good.

487
00:40:47,667 --> 00:40:50,267
But should have told Miyagi.

488
00:40:53,667 --> 00:40:57,533
Dugan talked with the principal. They
kicked me out of school for two weeks.

489
00:40:58,467 --> 00:41:00,467
Now I will never catch up with my classes.

490
00:41:00,467 --> 00:41:03,800
Maybe I should just forget about school...

491
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,600
....forget about my life.

492
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:10,067
Why can't I just lock myself in my room
and listen to music all day?

493
00:41:10,067 --> 00:41:12,533
No, please.

494
00:41:12,533 --> 00:41:14,600
Too hard on Miyagi ear.

495
00:41:15,667 --> 00:41:17,867
Have better idea.

496
00:41:17,867 --> 00:41:20,333
Tomorrow we go special place.

497
00:41:21,467 --> 00:41:25,333
Go visit long-time Miyagi friend.

498
00:41:27,533 --> 00:41:30,267
- Hi, Eric.
- What are you doing here?

499
00:41:30,267 --> 00:41:33,600
Something happened at school,
and I got suspended for a little while.

500
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:38,133
We're going out of town for a couple
weeks. Can you feed the hawk for me?

501
00:41:38,133 --> 00:41:39,867
What'd you get suspended for?

502
00:41:39,867 --> 00:41:44,000
It's a long story. I will tell you later.
Can you feed the hawk?

503
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,533
Yeah, no problem.

504
00:41:45,533 --> 00:41:49,133
Good. It's raw meat every other day
and keep the water bottle filled.

505
00:41:49,133 --> 00:41:51,533
Well, I am going to miss you.

506
00:41:51,533 --> 00:41:53,200
You going to miss me?

507
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,067
Maybe.

508
00:41:57,067 --> 00:42:00,667
Maybe? I am not accepting
any maybes today.

509
00:42:00,667 --> 00:42:01,933
Eric, watch out.

510
00:42:01,933 --> 00:42:03,933
I want an answer.
You going to miss me?

511
00:42:03,933 --> 00:42:07,133
- Not if you break your leg.
- That's not the answer I want.

512
00:42:08,733 --> 00:42:10,067
I want an answer.

513
00:42:11,533 --> 00:42:14,067
- Yes.
- What?

514
00:42:15,267 --> 00:42:17,000
Yes, I will miss you.

515
00:42:17,667 --> 00:42:19,133
Bye.

516
00:42:46,267 --> 00:42:51,933
Julie-san, you get five gallon
unleaded regular...

517
00:42:51,933 --> 00:42:55,400
....and some chocolate bar with almonds.

518
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,800
Right.

519
00:43:02,733 --> 00:43:04,600
- Hi.
- How are you?

520
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:08,400
Can I get five gallons of gas and some
chocolate bars with almonds, please?

521
00:43:18,333 --> 00:43:21,133
- Ted, what are you doing?
- I am not doing anything.

522
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:37,000
Hello, dog.

523
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,933
Nice puppy.

524
00:43:44,867 --> 00:43:46,400
Very nice dog.

525
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,067
How'd you do that, Mr. Miyagi?
That dog was about to attack me.

526
00:43:49,067 --> 00:43:52,933
- Anything possible if not afraid.
- I wish I had your courage.

527
00:43:52,933 --> 00:43:55,333
- Wish I had chocolate bar with almond.
- I got them.

528
00:43:55,333 --> 00:43:59,333
What the hell you think you're doing?
Look at my dog.

529
00:44:01,067 --> 00:44:03,733
You turned him into a damn chicken.

530
00:44:03,733 --> 00:44:06,867
Sometime animal have more sense than human.

531
00:44:06,867 --> 00:44:09,133
Yeah?
Well, you watch your mouth, old man.

532
00:44:09,133 --> 00:44:13,467
- Come on, let's just get out of here.
- You ain't going till I say so.

533
00:44:13,467 --> 00:44:15,867
Hey, let girl go.

534
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:21,200
- Watch it, Ted.
- What are you going to do, old man? Fight?

535
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,067
Fighting not good.

536
00:44:44,467 --> 00:44:47,533
Fighting not good.
Somebody always get hurt.

537
00:44:47,533 --> 00:44:49,933
Right. I totally agree.

538
00:44:51,267 --> 00:44:53,133
That was great, Mr. Miyagi.

539
00:44:54,867 --> 00:44:57,267
No, not great.

540
00:44:57,267 --> 00:45:00,200
Miyagi always look for way not to fight.

541
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:04,267
Miyagi hate fighting.
Was most unfortunate.

542
00:45:04,267 --> 00:45:08,067
"Unfortunate"? Come on. Aren't you glad
you kicked some guy's butt?

543
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:12,467
Not want to kick anything.

544
00:45:12,467 --> 00:45:16,800
Was most unfortunate their butts
attached to small brain.

545
00:45:30,333 --> 00:45:32,200
Now what?

546
00:45:33,733 --> 00:45:35,200
Now we wait.

547
00:46:32,533 --> 00:46:34,467
Sorry. Sorry.

548
00:46:45,467 --> 00:46:48,533
There's this loud bong going off,
and I couldn't sleep any longer.

549
00:46:50,267 --> 00:46:55,200
So I thought we'd get some breakfast.

550
00:46:56,533 --> 00:46:58,667
Earth to Miyagi.

551
00:46:59,933 --> 00:47:02,667
Come in, Mr. Miyagi.

552
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,867
Good morning, Julie-san.

553
00:47:18,467 --> 00:47:22,133
Rock garden is very sacred place.

554
00:47:22,133 --> 00:47:24,533
Is example of inner peace.

555
00:47:25,867 --> 00:47:28,467
Sand represent ocean.

556
00:47:28,467 --> 00:47:30,533
Big rock, Japan.

557
00:47:31,267 --> 00:47:33,267
Small rock, Okinawa...

558
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:36,733
- where Miyagi born.
- So?

559
00:47:36,733 --> 00:47:38,800
So, go visit Japan.

560
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:41,800
- What?
- Hurry up. Get on big rock.

561
00:47:45,867 --> 00:47:47,800
All right, I am on Japan.

562
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,800
Think I could buy a TV set
while I am here?

563
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,267
No, no, no. No TV set.

564
00:47:53,333 --> 00:47:57,067
First, you fake front kick at opponent.

565
00:47:57,067 --> 00:48:02,333
Roll hip, come around, make round kick,
land on Okinawa.

566
00:48:02,333 --> 00:48:04,933
- That sounds hard.
- Try.

567
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,600
That's impossible.

568
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:23,267
Anything try first time impossible,
but must try. Do again.

569
00:48:23,267 --> 00:48:25,867
Is there a trick to this--
something I haven't figured out?

570
00:48:25,867 --> 00:48:28,800
- Pray.
- Pray?

571
00:48:30,333 --> 00:48:33,667
Great. Wonderful.
That's a big help.

572
00:48:47,733 --> 00:48:49,933
Very good, Julie-san.
Try again.

573
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,600
When little girl growing up...

574
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:58,467
...parents always say, "Be good...

575
00:48:58,467 --> 00:49:01,800
...wear pretty dress, no fight."

576
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:04,533
Then, when same girl grow up...

577
00:49:04,533 --> 00:49:08,667
....when in time in dangerous situation,
she hesitate.

578
00:49:08,667 --> 00:49:12,867
Oh? So when is it okay?
I mean, how do you know when to f--

579
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:17,333
When you have full respect for self...

580
00:49:17,333 --> 00:49:20,533
....respect for others, that answer come.

581
00:49:24,533 --> 00:49:27,800
What are we supposed to do here?
Pitch some hay?

582
00:49:28,933 --> 00:49:31,467
Julie-san must learn be alert.

583
00:49:31,467 --> 00:49:35,200
Must know all times where is trouble.

584
00:49:36,933 --> 00:49:40,000
- All right, I am alert.
- Open eyes.

585
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,267
My eyes are already open.
What am I supposed to do?

586
00:49:49,067 --> 00:49:50,800
Focus, Julie-san.

587
00:49:54,267 --> 00:49:56,733
Boy, am I hungry.
I could eat a big juicy--

588
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,267
What?

589
00:51:00,933 --> 00:51:01,933
What?

590
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,600
What's the problem?

591
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:13,533
What'd I do wrong?

592
00:51:15,133 --> 00:51:18,267
Julie-san try to kill cockroach.

593
00:51:18,267 --> 00:51:22,467
What? Like you have never tried
to kill a cockroach before?

594
00:51:22,467 --> 00:51:25,467
Monks here believe...

595
00:51:25,467 --> 00:51:29,267
negative action cause
suffering and pain.

596
00:51:31,133 --> 00:51:36,400
So, therefore,
within monastery walls...

597
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,867
nothing is ever killed.

598
00:51:38,867 --> 00:51:40,867
Well, that's a stupid rule.

599
00:51:48,133 --> 00:51:50,000
Where you going?

600
00:51:55,333 --> 00:51:59,067
Is stupid when neighborhood gangs...

601
00:51:59,067 --> 00:52:01,067
....kill each other with no reason.

602
00:52:04,933 --> 00:52:09,467
Is stupid when countries fight wars.

603
00:52:11,333 --> 00:52:15,533
Not stupid to respect all living things.

604
00:52:16,667 --> 00:52:19,333
Yeah, I bet you have killed a cockroach.

605
00:52:21,133 --> 00:52:24,400
Miyagi don't live in monastery,
Julie-san...

606
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:28,733
but still respect all living things.

607
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,933
Attention!

608
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,800
By the time I'd left the army...

609
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,667
I had learned one thing:

610
00:52:43,667 --> 00:52:47,067
When you go into battle,
you must be strong.

611
00:52:47,067 --> 00:52:48,533
Eric McGowen?

612
00:52:48,533 --> 00:52:51,267
- Yeah.
- Eyes forward.

613
00:52:51,267 --> 00:52:52,733
Your mother's on the phone.

614
00:52:54,067 --> 00:52:57,600
You're not finished here.
You don't leave here until I say so.

615
00:53:01,667 --> 00:53:04,133
You leave here, and you can forget
about that recommendation...

616
00:53:04,133 --> 00:53:06,267
....to the Air Force Academy.

617
00:53:06,267 --> 00:53:10,667
That will be it for you. You will end up
flipping burgers the rest of your life.

618
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:19,667
<i>- Mom, what's wrong?
- Eric, it's me, Julie.</i>

619
00:53:19,667 --> 00:53:21,933
Julie. What's going on?

620
00:53:21,933 --> 00:53:25,667
Sorry I had to call you at school,
but the place I am at has no phone.

621
00:53:25,667 --> 00:53:27,333
I wanted to make sure Angel's okay.

622
00:53:28,333 --> 00:53:31,733
She's lonely.
I think she misses you.

623
00:53:31,733 --> 00:53:34,533
I hope this phony call
doesn't get you in trouble.

624
00:53:34,533 --> 00:53:38,800
<i>- So when are you coming back?
- I don't know.</i>

625
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,733
Well, you better make it soon, okay?

626
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,400
See you.

627
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:56,333
I am sorry I tried to kill
the cockroach. Look.

628
00:56:11,933 --> 00:56:13,183
Good.

629
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:25,933
This time I am not
going to get taken by surprise.

630
00:56:25,933 --> 00:56:28,267
That very good to hear, Julie-san.

631
00:56:28,267 --> 00:56:32,067
You're in here.
I know you are.

632
00:56:33,667 --> 00:56:36,867
- Feel alert, Julie-san?
- Totally.

633
00:56:36,867 --> 00:56:40,467
- Ready to defend self?
- No problem.

634
00:56:40,467 --> 00:56:42,067
Good.

635
00:56:43,267 --> 00:56:45,067
Then do with blindfold.

636
00:56:45,067 --> 00:56:48,667
Come on. How can I block an attack
if I can't see?

637
00:56:51,667 --> 00:56:57,267
Then you use ear, nose, skin, feet.

638
00:56:57,267 --> 00:57:00,800
Learn to use all senses.

639
00:57:11,867 --> 00:57:14,933
I did it! I was focused!
Totally focused!

640
00:57:20,533 --> 00:57:24,267
Must open senses wider, Julie-san.

641
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,600
I am really sorry.
I thought you guys were asleep.

642
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:29,000
I am out of here.
I will get out of here right away.

643
00:58:35,867 --> 00:58:39,467
I am sorry.
I am sorry, Mr. Miyagi.

644
00:58:42,667 --> 00:58:44,533
What's going on?

645
00:58:46,533 --> 00:58:48,667
Nothing.

646
00:58:48,667 --> 00:58:51,133
Just monks having good time.

647
00:58:53,933 --> 00:58:56,400
I thought they were supposed to be
spiritual leaders.

648
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:01,200
Never trust spiritual leader
who cannot dance.

649
00:59:27,133 --> 00:59:31,333
Mr. Miyagi, I can't do this.
I have tried a thousand times.

650
00:59:31,333 --> 00:59:35,000
You remember what I say
first time we do this?

651
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,200
Pray?

652
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:41,333
Praying mantis always
drop to one knee before strike.

653
01:00:00,933 --> 01:00:02,013
Yes! Yes!

654
01:00:07,667 --> 01:00:10,533
I did it! I did it! Yes!

655
01:00:16,133 --> 01:00:18,200
Congratulations, Julie-san.

656
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:22,133
"Congratulations"? That's all
you're going to say, is congratulations?

657
01:00:22,133 --> 01:00:25,133
- Don't I get a belt or something?
- Buy belt mall.

658
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:29,533
I mean a karate belt--
brown belt, black belt.

659
01:00:29,533 --> 01:00:32,733
- Why need belt?
- So everyone knows I am good.

660
01:00:32,733 --> 01:00:36,333
You know you good.
That the important thing.

661
01:00:36,333 --> 01:00:39,533
Come on.
Even Elvis Presley got a black belt.

662
01:00:39,533 --> 01:00:42,067
Borrow from Elvis
next time see him.

663
01:00:43,933 --> 01:00:47,667
Wax on, wax off.

664
01:00:48,733 --> 01:00:50,333
Very good, Julie-san.

665
01:00:53,533 --> 01:00:54,867
Miss spot.

666
01:01:15,733 --> 01:01:17,867
This called footwork kata.

667
01:01:26,267 --> 01:01:28,533
Footwork, footwork, footwork!
That's it!

668
01:01:32,667 --> 01:01:34,133
One more time! Whoa! Boom!

669
01:01:51,533 --> 01:01:53,667
Tomorrow we go home.

670
01:01:53,667 --> 01:01:55,667
Time go back school.

671
01:01:55,667 --> 01:01:58,267
Yeah, I know.

672
01:01:59,267 --> 01:02:02,667
I wish the monks had dinner with us.
I would have liked to say "good-bye."

673
01:02:10,467 --> 01:02:13,533
Monks discover something about Julie-san.

674
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,800
Think they like tell you something.
Come.

675
01:02:20,933 --> 01:02:24,533
Okay, I confess. I killed a spider
in my bedroom, but it was an accident.

676
01:02:24,533 --> 01:02:26,800
I even buried him
and said a little prayer.

677
01:02:32,667 --> 01:02:37,000
<i>Happy birthday to you.</i>

678
01:02:41,133 --> 01:02:45,667
<i>Happy birthday, dear Julie-san...</i>

679
01:02:45,667 --> 01:02:50,267
<i>- Happy birthday to you.
- This is great.</i>

680
01:02:50,267 --> 01:02:53,200
It's the first cake
I am ever going to eat with chopsticks.

681
01:02:54,267 --> 01:02:55,867
Blow candle, make wish.

682
01:02:55,867 --> 01:02:58,133
Maybe you get it.

683
01:03:05,933 --> 01:03:08,400
Monks agree...

684
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:13,133
....to give Julie-san one wish and one gift.

685
01:03:14,067 --> 01:03:17,933
Well, my one wish was that you guys
would come visit us in Boston.

686
01:03:19,533 --> 01:03:21,267
This is difficult.

687
01:03:21,267 --> 01:03:25,533
We have not left monastery for many years.

688
01:03:31,933 --> 01:03:34,000
Wish granted.

689
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:38,067
Now receive gift.

690
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:49,200
Your gift is demonstration
of Zen archery.

691
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:52,467
So, where's the target?

692
01:03:54,533 --> 01:03:56,333
You're looking at it.

693
01:03:57,267 --> 01:03:59,000
Excuse me?

694
01:04:00,067 --> 01:04:02,267
Abbot will shoot one arrow...

695
01:04:02,267 --> 01:04:04,600
....not for points.

696
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:07,667
If master small thing...

697
01:04:07,667 --> 01:04:10,200
....anything become possible.

698
01:04:11,333 --> 01:04:14,000
Miyagi volunteer for this honor.

699
01:05:12,133 --> 01:05:13,733
Thanks for the arrow.

700
01:05:31,867 --> 01:05:33,333
Hi, Julie!

701
01:05:35,067 --> 01:05:37,000
Good morning, Julie.
Welcome back.

702
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:40,400
Good morning, Mr. Wilkes.
Listen, I am sorry about what happened.

703
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:42,200
Well, I guess
you learned something.

704
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:45,200
Ambition without knowledge is like
a boat on dry land.

705
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:47,533
I don't quite understand your answer.

706
01:05:47,533 --> 01:05:50,733
The answer's only important
if you ask the right question.

707
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:57,133
- Hi, Eric.
- How you doing?

708
01:05:57,133 --> 01:05:58,533
Great. How are you?

709
01:05:58,533 --> 01:06:00,933
Just fine. Welcome back.

710
01:06:00,933 --> 01:06:02,400
Thanks.

711
01:06:03,267 --> 01:06:06,867
So, tell me....
where did you go?

712
01:06:08,067 --> 01:06:10,467
I can't tell you.

713
01:06:10,467 --> 01:06:13,667
- What do you mean, you can't tell me?
- You'd never believe me.

714
01:06:13,667 --> 01:06:15,667
Hey, I haven't been up
to see Angel yet. How is she?

715
01:06:15,667 --> 01:06:17,400
- She's fine. She's doing good.
- Is she?

716
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:18,800
- Yeah. We're best friends.
- Really?

717
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:20,733
- You want some milk?
- Thanks.

718
01:06:22,267 --> 01:06:24,200
Look who's back in school.

719
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:28,933
Looks like Ned and his friends
are still mad at me.

720
01:06:30,133 --> 01:06:32,267
Yeah, well, you're not the only one
they're mad at.

721
01:06:33,733 --> 01:06:36,267
- I quit Dugan's group.
- You what?

722
01:06:37,867 --> 01:06:39,733
Come on.
I will tell you about it.

723
01:06:42,067 --> 01:06:45,867
So, tell me about the Air Force Academy.
I thought Dugan could get you in.

724
01:06:45,867 --> 01:06:48,133
I don't need Dugan.
I can do it on my own.

725
01:06:48,133 --> 01:06:52,133
He's been giving people orders for
so long, he's got their brains fried.

726
01:06:52,133 --> 01:06:54,267
I want to be like Angel.

727
01:06:54,267 --> 01:06:55,733
I don't want to be someone....

728
01:06:58,667 --> 01:07:00,533
Where is she?

729
01:07:00,533 --> 01:07:02,600
She was in here yesterday.
I fed her.

730
01:07:03,533 --> 01:07:05,267
She had a broken wing.

731
01:07:05,267 --> 01:07:07,400
- She couldn't fly away.
- I don't know.

732
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:08,800
What's the matter, Julie?

733
01:07:10,333 --> 01:07:13,067
- Did you lose you little birdie?
- What did you do with her?

734
01:07:13,067 --> 01:07:15,400
The one that can't fly?

735
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:17,267
It might end up in a Dumpster.

736
01:07:18,067 --> 01:07:19,667
What are you.... a tough guy?

737
01:07:19,667 --> 01:07:21,067
- Tougher than you.
- Stop it, Eric.

738
01:07:21,067 --> 01:07:23,467
- Yeah?
- Don't! Eric!

739
01:07:23,467 --> 01:07:26,067
- Where's the hawk?
- I called Animal Control, McGowen.

740
01:07:26,067 --> 01:07:28,067
A man came,
and he put it in a cage.

741
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:32,867
- Stop it!
- I bet you he's going to kill it...

742
01:07:32,867 --> 01:07:34,533
and then he's going to stuff it.

743
01:07:34,533 --> 01:07:36,067
Yeah!

744
01:07:36,933 --> 01:07:38,933
- Eric, stop. Will you stop?
- Come on, man!

745
01:07:40,067 --> 01:07:41,667
Stop, Eric.
Forget about him.

746
01:07:41,667 --> 01:07:44,133
Oh, I am not done with you yet, McGowen.

747
01:07:44,133 --> 01:07:46,133
One way or another...

748
01:07:46,133 --> 01:07:48,067
we're going to finish this thing.

749
01:07:51,333 --> 01:07:53,333
Hi. Hi.

750
01:07:54,867 --> 01:07:57,333
Hi, Angel.
How'd they treat you in there?

751
01:07:58,933 --> 01:08:01,333
Angel ready to fly.

752
01:08:01,333 --> 01:08:04,533
That's impossible, Mr. Miyagi.
She's got a broken wing.

753
01:08:06,267 --> 01:08:08,067
Take chance.
See what happen.

754
01:08:08,067 --> 01:08:09,867
Nothing's going to happen.

755
01:08:11,067 --> 01:08:13,800
Angel decide, not Julie-san.

756
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:17,733
Come on.

757
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:26,000
I told you, Mr. Miyagi, she can't
fly away. She has a broken wing.

758
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,333
We don't know that yet.

759
01:08:46,867 --> 01:08:49,133
Now, let wind touch bird.

760
01:08:54,733 --> 01:08:56,600
Maybe if you believe...

761
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:58,600
....Angel believe too.

762
01:09:03,267 --> 01:09:04,667
Now release.

763
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:11,467
Okay.
Fly away, Angel.

764
01:09:27,867 --> 01:09:31,400
What's wrong, Angel?
You're free. Go on. Fly away.

765
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:35,000
Sometimes,
when live in cage too long...

766
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:38,533
...whole world seem like very big place.

767
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:44,000
You're strong, Angel.

768
01:09:46,733 --> 01:09:48,467
I know you are.

769
01:09:49,667 --> 01:09:52,200
Fly away. Fly free.

770
01:09:59,733 --> 01:10:01,733
You healed her, Mr. Miyagi.

771
01:10:02,867 --> 01:10:05,667
No. Angel heal self.

772
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:10,200
But your faith give her courage to fly.

773
01:10:16,333 --> 01:10:18,067
Come. We go.

774
01:10:24,533 --> 01:10:27,600
I am really going to miss Angel.

775
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:31,000
I used to talk to her a lot.
I told her everything.

776
01:10:32,267 --> 01:10:35,933
You lucky
you have Angel talk to.

777
01:10:35,933 --> 01:10:37,933
She no talk back.

778
01:10:39,333 --> 01:10:41,800
Maybe now you talk Miyagi...

779
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:43,733
or your friend, Eric.

780
01:10:46,533 --> 01:10:49,733
He asked me to the senior prom.
I didn't know what to say.

781
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:54,800
What problem?
You no like boy?

782
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:57,000
Yeah, I like him...

783
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:00,000
but it's a formal dance,
and I don't have a dress.

784
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:03,867
Even if I did go,
I probably wouldn't fit in.

785
01:11:03,867 --> 01:11:07,600
What would happen if they started doing
an old-fashioned waltz or something?

786
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:09,533
I don't know how to waltz.

787
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:13,467
All things possible, Julie-san.

788
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:18,267
I have to admit, though,
it was nice to get asked.

789
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:39,533
May I help you, sir?

790
01:11:39,533 --> 01:11:41,400
Oh, yes.

791
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:44,133
Want to buy dress.

792
01:11:44,133 --> 01:11:46,533
Formal dance-- very important.

793
01:11:46,533 --> 01:11:49,733
Of course. Well, as you see,
we have all sorts of styles.

794
01:11:49,733 --> 01:11:53,867
Do you like an A-line,
or do you like a tea length?

795
01:11:53,867 --> 01:11:56,133
Do you like off-the-shoulder?

796
01:11:56,133 --> 01:11:59,867
Miyagi like everything,
but dress not for me.

797
01:11:59,867 --> 01:12:01,467
Dress for teenage girl.

798
01:12:01,467 --> 01:12:06,133
Of course. Well, what kind
of a girl is she? Is she trendy...

799
01:12:06,133 --> 01:12:07,933
or conservative?

800
01:12:07,933 --> 01:12:11,067
We can do a silk charmeuse
or a crepe de chine.

801
01:12:12,667 --> 01:12:15,333
Girl have good spinning back kick...

802
01:12:15,333 --> 01:12:17,933
but need work on sword-hand block.

803
01:12:18,667 --> 01:12:21,933
Yes, that's very helpful.

804
01:12:21,933 --> 01:12:23,400
Is she tall?

805
01:12:25,933 --> 01:12:29,800
Not too tall,
but not short.

806
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:32,067
Not fat.

807
01:12:32,067 --> 01:12:33,933
Not skinny. Slender.

808
01:12:35,133 --> 01:12:36,467
Like this.

809
01:12:45,867 --> 01:12:47,467
Hi, Mr. Miyagi.

810
01:12:48,467 --> 01:12:50,333
What are you doing?

811
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:56,400
Today we practice karate inside house.

812
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:58,733
Here, in the parlor?

813
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:01,520
Ready?

814
01:13:02,933 --> 01:13:04,600
Sure.

815
01:13:09,667 --> 01:13:12,933
Today Miyagi show you new kata.

816
01:13:12,933 --> 01:13:14,533
Okay?

817
01:13:14,533 --> 01:13:19,333
First, lead with left foot,
right punch.

818
01:13:19,333 --> 01:13:20,733
Okay.

819
01:13:20,733 --> 01:13:24,333
- Then Julie-san follow.
- Okay.

820
01:13:28,267 --> 01:13:30,533
Side step, punch.

821
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:35,067
Punch, side step.

822
01:13:35,067 --> 01:13:37,000
Feet together.

823
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:40,267
This time, Miyagi move, you counter.

824
01:13:41,333 --> 01:13:42,333
Go.

825
01:13:45,933 --> 01:13:47,400
Feet together.

826
01:13:50,067 --> 01:13:51,400
Side.

827
01:13:52,333 --> 01:13:53,600
Once more.

828
01:13:55,267 --> 01:13:56,467
Right?

829
01:13:58,067 --> 01:13:59,933
- Counter.
- Okay.

830
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:06,867
Feet together.
Just a minute.

831
01:14:10,467 --> 01:14:11,533
Go.

832
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:22,467
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

833
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:31,800
I can't believe it.
I am dancing.

834
01:14:33,067 --> 01:14:34,533
Where'd you learn this?

835
01:14:34,533 --> 01:14:38,533
Miyagi invent new kata
called "Karate Waltz."

836
01:14:40,267 --> 01:14:43,333
Actually,
Julie-san grandpapa teach.

837
01:14:43,333 --> 01:14:45,667
Was in World War Two, France.

838
01:14:45,667 --> 01:14:48,067
He tell Miyagi, "You can dance.

839
01:14:48,067 --> 01:14:51,333
You can fight, you can dance,
you have good footwork."

840
01:14:54,667 --> 01:14:57,467
I still don't know
what I am going to wear to this thing.

841
01:14:57,467 --> 01:15:00,800
Oh, yes.
Miyagi forget something.

842
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:03,000
You stay, practice.
I be right back.

843
01:15:20,333 --> 01:15:22,867
Late birthday present from Miyagi.

844
01:15:27,533 --> 01:15:28,933
Oh, it's beautiful.

845
01:15:30,067 --> 01:15:32,000
Miyagi want you to go dance.

846
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,067
How'd you know my size?

847
01:15:34,067 --> 01:15:37,133
That was very difficult part.

848
01:15:38,133 --> 01:15:41,333
It's too bad
you never had a daughter, Mr. Miyagi.

849
01:15:41,333 --> 01:15:42,800
You would have been a good parent.

850
01:15:43,467 --> 01:15:44,600
Thank you.

851
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,133
One minute.

852
01:15:54,133 --> 01:15:57,867
As a new parent,
may I have this dance?

853
01:16:19,333 --> 01:16:23,200
So, you call Eric,
you tell him we go dance.

854
01:16:24,667 --> 01:16:27,400
What do you mean, "we"?

855
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:29,267
Miyagi drive car.

856
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:34,467
Mr. Miyagi, it doesn't exactly
work that way.

857
01:16:35,267 --> 01:16:40,067
Okay, then Mr. Miyagi stay home,
wait like anxious parent.

858
01:16:40,067 --> 01:16:41,533
Okay.

859
01:17:22,467 --> 01:17:23,733
Come on.

860
01:18:08,733 --> 01:18:10,733
I am Eric.
I am here for Julie Pierce.

861
01:18:38,133 --> 01:18:39,533
I am Eric McGowen.

862
01:18:39,533 --> 01:18:43,067
Oh, yes. Honored to meet you.
Miyagi here.

863
01:18:43,067 --> 01:18:45,933
I am taking Julie
to the dance tonight.

864
01:18:45,933 --> 01:18:48,733
Oh, yes. Of course...

865
01:18:48,733 --> 01:18:52,333
you bring her home by 10:00?

866
01:18:52,333 --> 01:18:55,400
Well, see,
the dance goes to midnight.

867
01:18:57,467 --> 01:19:00,200
So, why don't I bring her back
around 1:00?

868
01:19:03,867 --> 01:19:06,400
What you do for extra hour?

869
01:19:09,067 --> 01:19:09,787
Well--

870
01:19:11,467 --> 01:19:13,800
Treat her with respect.

871
01:19:14,467 --> 01:19:16,000
Right.

872
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,800
Treat her with respect
for one hour.

873
01:19:20,333 --> 01:19:21,533
Good.

874
01:19:25,667 --> 01:19:27,267
Friend Eric here.

875
01:19:30,067 --> 01:19:32,400
You can come in, Mr. Miyagi.

876
01:19:49,333 --> 01:19:51,800
I wish my parents could see this.

877
01:19:53,067 --> 01:19:54,933
Oh, parents watching.

878
01:19:56,067 --> 01:19:59,867
I still remember what you said to me
at the monastery...

879
01:19:59,867 --> 01:20:02,133
about keeping them in my heart.

880
01:20:04,733 --> 01:20:08,267
It's a way to love someone
even if they're not with you.

881
01:20:09,067 --> 01:20:13,067
Parents very proud...

882
01:20:13,067 --> 01:20:15,067
....like Miyagi...

883
01:20:15,067 --> 01:20:17,000
very happy.

884
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:25,933
Oh, Julie-san,
tonight you are beautiful woman.

885
01:20:35,533 --> 01:20:36,733
Go.

886
01:20:45,933 --> 01:20:47,333
Enjoy dance.

887
01:20:49,133 --> 01:20:51,933
Maybe Miyagi celebrate too.

888
01:20:51,933 --> 01:20:54,400
Take monks for ride on town.

889
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:13,333
See you later, guys.

890
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:21,933
- Who are those people?
- Friends.

891
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:26,467
- I like them.
- I like them too.

892
01:21:54,867 --> 01:21:57,200
That is a nice dress.

893
01:21:57,933 --> 01:21:59,733
You better watch the road, Eric.

894
01:21:59,733 --> 01:22:04,067
You know, you look like you,
but you don't look like you.

895
01:22:06,067 --> 01:22:09,000
- One way.
- You are so beautiful.

896
01:22:10,333 --> 01:22:11,733
It's a one-way street, Eric!

897
01:22:15,333 --> 01:22:18,733
Do you really want to do this?

898
01:22:26,133 --> 01:22:26,267
"Boston Bowl"

899
01:22:26,267 --> 01:22:28,000
"Boston Bowl"

900
01:22:32,267 --> 01:22:35,867
Don't touch this ball, all right?
This ball cost serious money.

901
01:22:35,867 --> 01:22:39,333
Sorry.
Don't understand English.

902
01:22:39,333 --> 01:22:40,733
Look, don't talk either.

903
01:22:40,733 --> 01:22:42,467
What the problem?

904
01:22:42,467 --> 01:22:45,867
Don't breathe, don't move.
I don't want any distractions.

905
01:22:45,867 --> 01:22:49,467
Perhaps we can make a small contest.

906
01:22:51,067 --> 01:22:53,067
Say, buck a point?

907
01:22:53,067 --> 01:22:54,667
Just a minute.

908
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:01,533
Do you believe these guys?
It will be a piece of cake.

909
01:23:07,133 --> 01:23:08,600
Contest covered.

910
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:42,933
Why do they
keep their eyes closed?

911
01:23:43,733 --> 01:23:46,600
It's called Zen bowling.

912
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:51,200
No have to see pins,
only have to think about target.

913
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:01,667
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

914
01:25:07,333 --> 01:25:08,933
I am sorry.

915
01:25:09,733 --> 01:25:11,867
Sorry for what?

916
01:25:11,867 --> 01:25:14,533
For getting you in trouble
with Ned and his friends.

917
01:25:17,133 --> 01:25:18,600
You're worth it.

918
01:25:50,333 --> 01:25:51,800
Yeah!

919
01:26:21,333 --> 01:26:23,333
Look!

920
01:26:42,267 --> 01:26:43,667
Help me get him down.

921
01:26:44,467 --> 01:26:45,800
You all right?

922
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,800
- I hit my arm.
- Yeah?

923
01:26:50,933 --> 01:26:52,267
Whose idea was this?

924
01:26:53,467 --> 01:26:55,467
Ned's.
Dugan said it would be all right.

925
01:26:55,467 --> 01:26:56,800
Leave him alone, McGowen.

926
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:59,333
This is real smart, Ned.
I think you broke your buddy's arm here.

927
01:26:59,333 --> 01:27:01,867
At least he was
brave enough to try it.

928
01:27:01,867 --> 01:27:03,533
Why don't you
Just mind your business?

929
01:27:04,733 --> 01:27:06,867
- You're okay, right?
- Yeah.

930
01:27:22,267 --> 01:27:23,733
- Those guys are idiots.
- Right here, McGowen.

931
01:27:23,733 --> 01:27:26,267
- Oh, yeah?
- Don't fight.

932
01:27:28,067 --> 01:27:29,267
Jerk.

933
01:27:29,267 --> 01:27:32,200
McGowen just challenged me.

934
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:34,600
I am not letting him
get away with this.

935
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:35,933
Absolutely.

936
01:27:50,133 --> 01:27:52,533
None of this would have happened
if it hadn't been for me.

937
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:57,467
What?
What are you talking about?

938
01:27:57,467 --> 01:27:59,933
Hey, listen,
I am glad this happened.

939
01:27:59,933 --> 01:28:02,933
Forget about Dugan.
I don't need him.

940
01:28:02,933 --> 01:28:05,733
I am going to live my life my way.

941
01:28:06,733 --> 01:28:08,733
Sometimes that's difficult.

942
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:11,467
Not when I am with you.

943
01:28:19,067 --> 01:28:23,267
So, Mr. Miyagi is teaching you karate?

944
01:28:24,333 --> 01:28:26,467
- Yeah, a little.
- Yeah?

945
01:28:29,867 --> 01:28:33,800
So, if I try to kiss you,
will you use it?

946
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:37,933
- The sun is warm. The grass is green.
- What?

947
01:28:40,867 --> 01:28:42,000
Nothing.

948
01:28:53,933 --> 01:28:55,533
What was that?

949
01:28:55,533 --> 01:28:57,800
Let's go, McGowen.

950
01:29:02,533 --> 01:29:04,000
Are you all right?

951
01:29:12,133 --> 01:29:14,333
I will see you at the docks, McGowen...

952
01:29:14,333 --> 01:29:17,133
....if you're brave enough to go.

953
01:29:18,333 --> 01:29:22,467
- You all right? Look at this.
- Yeah. Let's call the police.

954
01:29:22,467 --> 01:29:24,667
Why? What's the point? They're
Just going to lie about what happened.

955
01:29:24,667 --> 01:29:26,933
- What are we going to do?
- We are not doing anything.

956
01:29:26,933 --> 01:29:29,467
I am going to settle this thing
once and for all.

957
01:30:09,267 --> 01:30:12,600
- Where's your little buddies, Ned?
- I didn't think you were going to show.

958
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:14,333
Yeah?

959
01:30:14,333 --> 01:30:16,400
It's one on one.

960
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:18,733
One on one, man.
Now I am going to teach you how to fight.

961
01:30:18,733 --> 01:30:21,733
You want a piece of me?
Now's the time.

962
01:30:21,733 --> 01:30:23,067
Let's go.

963
01:30:28,267 --> 01:30:30,133
Remember the bullring, McGowen?

964
01:30:32,533 --> 01:30:35,733
As I recall, you didn't think much
of that particular exercise.

965
01:30:35,733 --> 01:30:37,800
Maybe now you wish you'd
paid more attention.

966
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:39,533
I got a piece of you, didn't I?

967
01:30:39,533 --> 01:30:43,400
Yes, you did.
Now it's payback time.

968
01:30:44,667 --> 01:30:48,000
Well, son, this time you have
bitten off more than you can chew.

969
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,400
- Let me have him, Ned.
- Not now, Charlie.

970
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:53,600
We're a team.
We're going to do this together.

971
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:56,533
- Come on. Come on!
- Light it.

972
01:31:08,467 --> 01:31:10,333
Come on, McGowen,
let's go.

973
01:31:19,733 --> 01:31:21,067
Come on, Eric.

974
01:31:23,267 --> 01:31:24,467
Pick him up.

975
01:31:31,133 --> 01:31:34,400
We haven't even started yet, McGowen.
Come on.

976
01:31:37,667 --> 01:31:40,333
You wanted me, McGowen.
You wanted a piece of me, right?

977
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:45,867
- Well, you got it.
- Get up!

978
01:31:50,133 --> 01:31:52,133
You're not that tough.
Come on.

979
01:31:52,133 --> 01:31:53,733
Come here! Come here!

980
01:31:59,867 --> 01:32:02,133
You're not going to quit.
Come on, quitter.

981
01:32:08,667 --> 01:32:12,200
Oh, come on, McGowen. I thought
you were tougher than that, pal.

982
01:32:15,067 --> 01:32:18,200
Higher.
I want to see his eyes.

983
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:20,533
- Thanks for showing up, McGowen.
- Anytime.

984
01:32:22,467 --> 01:32:23,800
Pick him up.

985
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:28,800
Come here. Come here.

986
01:32:30,467 --> 01:32:33,000
Finish him off.

987
01:32:35,333 --> 01:32:37,333
What are you all looking at?

988
01:32:37,333 --> 01:32:39,667
What do you think
I have been training you for?

989
01:32:40,333 --> 01:32:41,667
Ned, kick him.

990
01:32:43,200 --> 01:32:44,733
Do it!

991
01:32:46,533 --> 01:32:49,133
- Dugan, he's down.
- Pick him up!

992
01:32:49,133 --> 01:32:52,200
- Do it.
- Please.

993
01:33:16,467 --> 01:33:17,467
What?

994
01:33:21,867 --> 01:33:23,733
- Get out of here.
- Come on.

995
01:33:23,733 --> 01:33:25,333
Come. I call police.

996
01:33:25,333 --> 01:33:29,133
McGowen was speeding around in his car.
Obviously he had a car accident.

997
01:33:29,133 --> 01:33:30,533
That's a lie, man.

998
01:33:30,533 --> 01:33:34,800
Is no accident when fight is
five against one.

999
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:37,600
Ned here could have beaten McGowen
with his arms behind his back.

1000
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:40,267
Come. We go.

1001
01:33:40,267 --> 01:33:42,067
Julie.... What?

1002
01:33:42,067 --> 01:33:43,600
What, are you kidding me?

1003
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,600
- Let me fight him.
- You want to fight me?

1004
01:33:48,733 --> 01:33:51,533
Julie-san, no fighting.

1005
01:33:51,533 --> 01:33:54,667
- Please.
- Colonel, she wants to fight me.

1006
01:33:56,733 --> 01:33:59,067
If I am ever going to respect myself,
I have to do this.

1007
01:34:01,133 --> 01:34:03,067
Mr. Miyagi, please tell her
she's going to get hurt.

1008
01:34:06,333 --> 01:34:08,133
Julie-san right.

1009
01:34:09,133 --> 01:34:10,867
Now is time.

1010
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:21,267
Just remember:
True strength come from inside.

1011
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:26,133
If you're going to do this...

1012
01:34:26,133 --> 01:34:29,333
....you put her away.

1013
01:34:29,333 --> 01:34:31,267
Do you understand me?

1014
01:34:34,267 --> 01:34:36,667
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

1015
01:34:48,933 --> 01:34:51,600
Guys, this is really embarrassing.

1016
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,133
But okay.

1017
01:34:55,133 --> 01:34:56,733
Give me your best shot.

1018
01:35:12,067 --> 01:35:13,267
Slow down!

1019
01:35:13,267 --> 01:35:15,533
Use your strength.

1020
01:35:29,133 --> 01:35:32,200
That was really good, Julie.
It really was.

1021
01:35:36,067 --> 01:35:37,267
Stop this!

1022
01:35:38,867 --> 01:35:40,533
But it wasn't good enough.

1023
01:35:40,533 --> 01:35:42,000
Come on!

1024
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:53,067
Focus, Julie-san.

1025
01:36:21,400 --> 01:36:25,000
All over, Julie-san.
We go.

1026
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:25,133
What are you talking about?

1027
01:36:25,133 --> 01:36:27,133
What are you talking about?

1028
01:36:27,133 --> 01:36:29,200
The war is not over
because one battle's lost.

1029
01:36:30,733 --> 01:36:33,267
- Charlie will fight her.
- No, sir.

1030
01:36:33,267 --> 01:36:36,133
- Come on, Charlie. I said, fight her!
- No, sir. What are you doing? No!

1031
01:36:38,333 --> 01:36:39,733
You're crazy, man.

1032
01:36:41,533 --> 01:36:44,333
- Morgan, you fight her.
- Colonel, it's over.

1033
01:36:46,667 --> 01:36:48,600
Ned, get up and finish the job.

1034
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,733
I said,
get up and finish the job!

1035
01:36:52,733 --> 01:36:54,467
- No more.
- What?

1036
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:57,600
Enough!

1037
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:59,400
It's not over.

1038
01:36:59,400 --> 01:37:01,733
Then we finish.

1039
01:37:12,200 --> 01:37:13,600
Absolutely.

1040
01:37:16,533 --> 01:37:18,267
I am going to put your lights out.

1041
01:37:59,533 --> 01:38:01,933
Time put your lights out.

1042
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
You said you had
all the answers, Colonel.

1043
01:38:41,467 --> 01:38:44,267
- You were great.
- Not great.

1044
01:38:49,733 --> 01:38:51,533
You kicked some butt.

1045
01:38:52,600 --> 01:38:57,733
Julie-san, how many times Miyagi say
fighting not good?

1046
01:38:57,733 --> 01:39:00,200
I know.
Somebody always gets hurt.

1047
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,467
Mr. Miyagi,
come on, admit it:

1048
01:39:04,467 --> 01:39:06,000
We kicked some butt.

1049
01:39:08,200 --> 01:39:10,333
Fighting not good...

1050
01:39:10,333 --> 01:39:14,067
....but if must fight, win.

1051
01:39:15,067 --> 01:39:25,067
