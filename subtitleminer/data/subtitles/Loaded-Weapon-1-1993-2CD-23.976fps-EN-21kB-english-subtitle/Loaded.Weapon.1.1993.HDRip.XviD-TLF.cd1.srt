1
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:50,572
What the hell was that?

2
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,941
Hello, hello.
How are you?

3
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:53,912
Nice weather
we are having today.

4
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:55,471
Nice weather?

5
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:59,007
You think
we're having nice weather?

6
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,012
I guess you didn't lose
the only one...

7
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:04,046
that meant anything
in your life.

8
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:06,456
I guess you don't feel
burned out...

9
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:08,552
by the human misery
and despair...

10
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:10,153
perpetrated
by the criminal vermin...

11
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:13,029
that infest every pore
of this decaying city...

12
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:16,331
forcing you to guzzle cheap wine
and cheaper whiskey...

13
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:18,894
to dull the pain
that shatters your heart...

14
00:02:18,938 --> 00:02:22,430
rips at your soul,
keeps your days forever gray.

15
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:27,002
What flavor Icee you got today?

16
00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:28,206
Kiwi cherry.

17
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,805
Oh, baby.

18
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:26,138
Namaste.

19
00:03:26,172 --> 00:03:27,469
Excuse me.

20
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:29,975
Do you have any of these
in taupe?

21
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:32,307
No taupe.
Beef jerky.

22
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:35,007
And you call this
a convenience store?

23
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:42,048
Open up the cash register,
or I'll splatter your brains.

24
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:43,248
Excuse me.

25
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,327
You scuzzballs mind
if I join in?

26
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:57,462
I know what you're thinking,
punk.

27
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:58,691
You're thinking...

28
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:01,165
"Did he fire 173 times...

29
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,725
"or 174?"

30
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:07,069
Well, do you feel lucky...

31
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:08,300
punk?

32
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,545
You guys got to get
that thing fixed.

33
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,488
I know. Don't thank me.

34
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:26,117
I'm just a cop doing his job.

35
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:11,367
You have reached the desk
of Sergeant Wes Luger.

36
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:14,134
Please leave a message
after the beep.

37
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:15,765
Yeah, Wes. It's me, Billy.

38
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:18,038
Hey! I said, "after the beep."

39
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:19,374
Well, excuse me.

40
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:20,902
Listen, it's nine thirty...

41
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,784
Oh, nine thirty-seven.

42
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:29,083
Look, it's just getting
too dangerous to wait here.

43
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:30,589
I got to get out.

44
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:33,091
Meet me at the Squealer's Hotel
in forty-five minutes.

45
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:35,356
I have a contact there.

46
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:22,639
Who is it?

47
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:25,769
Wilderness Girls.

48
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:43,885
Wilderness Girls.

49
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,659
A little late
to be selling cookies.

50
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:49,725
Troop leader says
we are not meeting our quota.

51
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:56,475
I'll take a couple of boxes.

52
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:58,807
That won't be necessary,
Miss York.

53
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:10,047
I got to be honest.

54
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:11,920
You look better in the wig.

55
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:15,689
My hairstyle is the least
of your worries.

56
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:16,956
Wilderness Girls, eh?

57
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,964
So that's how you're
moving the drugs.

58
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:22,456
Brilliant, Miss York.
Now...

59
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,801
Where is the meecrofilm?

60
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:26,964
The what?

61
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,871
The meecrofilm.

62
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:31,035
I don't know anything
about any meecrofilm.

63
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:33,773
Don't play coy with me.

64
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:35,474
This is too important.

65
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,483
And this is the plot.

66
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,985
Important enough so that anyone
within earshot...

67
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,817
should listen to each
and every detail?

68
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,482
That important.

69
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,992
And you're talking
about the microfilm...

70
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,859
which holds the recipe
for turning cocaine...

71
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:51,386
into innocent-looking cookies?

72
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:55,127
I don't know anything about it.

73
00:08:55,167 --> 00:09:01,868
In a little while, Miss York,
you will be begging for mercy.

74
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:03,705
No, no. I'll beg now.

75
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:06,109
Save yourself unnecessary pain.

76
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:07,305
Tell me!

77
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:08,472
McCracken.

78
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:11,108
Thank you, Miss York.

79
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:20,352
Is that Dan McCracken
or Mike McCracken?

80
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,190
Mike.

81
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:29,100
Is he on Alpine or Oak?

82
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:31,660
Alpine.

83
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:37,206
Hey, psst!

84
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,404
Park on Third.

85
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:41,913
You'll never find a spot
on Alpine.

86
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:45,543
Thank you.
You have been most cooperative.

87
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,519
Don't mention it.

88
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:55,650
And, you, remember,
you saw nothing.

89
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:33,760
What you got, Irv?

90
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:37,257
Oh. Beats me, Sarge.

91
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:40,295
Dandruff, seborrhea,
maybe just dry, itchy scalp.

92
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:43,308
Have you tried this, Irv?
I use it.

93
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:44,775
Head & Shoulders?

94
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,472
Sarge, you don't have dandruff.

95
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:49,208
I know.

96
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:51,239
Are you ready to limbo?

97
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:57,856
What'll it be?
Matte finish or glossy?

98
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,016
Matte.

99
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:00,685
Good choice.

100
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:02,717
Be ready in about a week.

101
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:05,823
So what are we looking at
here, Doc?

102
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:08,197
The worst-dressed stiff
I've ever seen.

103
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:11,203
This stiff and I pounded a beat
together for five years...

104
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:12,795
so show some respect.

105
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,305
I'm sorry, Wes.

106
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,808
I see so much
of this senseless mayhem...

107
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:20,107
that sometimes I get
a little insensitive.

108
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:23,809
All right, this loser has taken
the chickenshit way out...

109
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,510
and punched her own ticket.

110
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:29,351
Suicide, huh?

111
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:31,618
She must have caught
herself by surprise.

112
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:34,125
Found these
on the floor near her.

113
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,855
Wilderness Girl cookies.

114
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:41,058
Give me a hand, Doc.

115
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,829
Sure.

116
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,749
You knew her, Sarge?

117
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:36,982
Yeah, I knew her.

118
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:39,320
She was my partner.

119
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:40,757
I'm sorry, Sarge.

120
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:46,290
Hey... hey, Sarge.

121
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:47,765
It's tingling.

122
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,428
Good, Irv.
That means it's working.

123
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:52,687
Here's to getting through
another lousy day.

124
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,839
Claire.

125
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:15,643
I miss you so much.

126
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,515
I'm trying, Claire.

127
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,026
God knows I'm trying.

128
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:27,922
But it's too damn hard
without you.

129
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:31,769
I'll get the bastards
that took you.

130
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,968
Well, Herb,
back to the salt mines.

131
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:40,001
Mind if I drive this time?

132
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,253
This is supposed to be
an express line!

133
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,884
No, he had fuller lips.
Pouting lips.

134
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:57,987
Wide eyes.
Yes, that's him.

135
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,497
Dooley, give it a break.

136
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:00,759
What's going on?

137
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:02,960
Dooley's bet us he can escape
in fifteen minutes.

138
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:05,698
- How long has he been at it?
- Three days.

139
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,467
Better step on it, Dooley.

140
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:14,673
You think crime's
taking a holiday?

141
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:15,839
Well, think again!

142
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:18,509
- What the hell you want, Luger?
- I want the York case.

143
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,882
There is no York case!
It was a suicide! Coffee?

144
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,046
No, thanks.

145
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,782
Cappuccino? Espresso?

146
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:28,424
Hey, Scotty, can you get
this machine to work?

147
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,189
I'm giving it
all she's got, Captain!

148
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:33,665
If I push it any harder,
the whole thing'll blow!

149
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:36,066
Give me my plate!

150
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:38,900
I don't think York
was a suicide.

151
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,269
She was onto something.

152
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:42,274
On something is more like it.

153
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:45,835
Those Wilderness Girls cookies
was laced with cocaine!

154
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:48,346
No wonder
I couldn't eat just one.

155
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:54,119
York left me a message.

156
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:56,121
She'd uncovered
a drug-running operation.

157
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:57,986
I think that's
what got her killed.

158
00:15:58,023 --> 00:15:59,991
You don't think
it was the bullets?

159
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:01,583
Give me the case.

160
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,255
You're days from retirement.
Let it go.

161
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:08,926
York was a partner, a friend.
I owe her.

162
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,368
I owe it to every cop
who's walked a beat...

163
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:13,132
every cop who's made a bust...

164
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:15,140
who's ever laid
his life on the line!

165
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:16,334
Wait a minute!

166
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,639
I'm the captain here!
I do all the yelling!

167
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:21,646
If it's that important to you,
take the damn case!

168
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,238
Thank... thank you, Captain.

169
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:25,512
Don't be so fast to thank me!

170
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:28,247
Because you're going
to be naked on this one.

171
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:30,255
People are going to be watching!

172
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:33,258
You screw up,
you'll be hung out to dry!

173
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:36,056
You drop the ball, you'll be
left twisting in the wind!

174
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,722
If you embarrass
this department...

175
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:39,355
your pants
will be dancing with figs!

176
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:40,558
Is that clear?

177
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:43,762
Everything
but the pants-fig thing.

178
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:45,861
And one other thing...

179
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:48,236
Narco's sending over one
of their burned-out psychos...

180
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:50,264
to look into
the Wilderness Girl cookies.

181
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:51,936
I'm teaming him with you.

182
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:54,411
Captain, you know I work alone.

183
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:57,142
You get the case,
you get Jack Colt!

184
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:02,510
Cigarette!

185
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:04,419
Cigarette!
Hit the floor!

186
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:09,826
Hey, back off!

187
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,386
Easy.

188
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,660
That's Luger's new partner.

189
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:17,533
Captain, you can't seriously
be thinking of using this man.

190
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:19,662
He's dangerous, a menace.

191
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,229
A loose cannon.

192
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:23,070
A walking time bomb.

193
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:26,168
Most of all, he is gun-happy.

194
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:30,215
Where do you get off
saying that?

195
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:37,449
I give up.

196
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:38,979
There's someone
you better talk to...

197
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:41,049
if this case involves cookies.

198
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:42,219
Not him.

199
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:44,161
Yeah. Him.

200
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:52,094
You know the rules.

201
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:53,798
Do not touch the glass.

202
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:55,568
Do not hand him
any sharp instruments...

203
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:57,973
power tools, sewing materials,
or condiments.

204
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,982
Make sure you stay to the left
when you walk down the hall.

205
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:12,513
He's in the last cell.

206
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:25,964
The right!
I meant stay to the right!

207
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:01,265
What?

208
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:05,734
Un papa?

209
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,949
Is it a code?

210
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,349
An obscure foreign language?

211
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:21,586
So, this is Mr. "Screw
With Your Brain...

212
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:22,753
"Eat Your Spleen...

213
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:25,592
"Wear Your Flesh As A Hair Net"
Leacher, huh?

214
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:28,395
Well, look who's
Mr. Scaredy Pants now.

215
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,167
Identification, please.

216
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,100
Closer.

217
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:42,974
Please sit.

218
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:48,584
Dr. Leacher,
we need to ask you...

219
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:52,021
There's someone out there
again, isn't there?

220
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:54,389
A bad boy with pastries.

221
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:02,456
Hai Karate. You wear that
sometimes, don't you?

222
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:06,062
But not today.
Today it's...

223
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:07,594
mentholated deep-heat rub.

224
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,844
You order chef's salad
with dressing on the side.

225
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,176
You have an attractive wife
with perky breasts...

226
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,478
a nine-year-old son,
and a sixteen-year-old daughter.

227
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:18,915
Who told you that?

228
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:21,920
I saw their picture
in your wallet.

229
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:23,922
We came to talk about cookies.

230
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:27,050
Quid pro quo, Mr. Colt.

231
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:29,151
What's that mean?

232
00:20:29,194 --> 00:20:31,992
It means I'm pretentious.

233
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:35,761
Tell me about the worst meal
you've ever eaten, Mr. Colt.

234
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:38,261
Quick!

235
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:40,396
Uh, it was a fish sandwich at...

236
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:41,701
Don't tell him anything.

237
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,071
Can you help us?

238
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:46,077
You hold the key, Mr. Colt.

239
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:51,679
Look into yourself for an answer
to the cookie concern.

240
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:54,208
Look to a man with whom
you were involved.

241
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:01,192
No, no. Not him.

242
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:02,818
It was in Vietnam.

243
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:12,867
You disappoint me, Mr. Colt.

244
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:15,134
It was Mortars.
General Mortars.

245
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,072
W-wait a minute.

246
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,236
L... I never...

247
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,303
I didn't mean
that kind of involvement.

248
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,779
You were under his command.

249
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:26,613
Mortars was once my patient.

250
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:28,916
I taught him
to express his anger.

251
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,182
You taught him well.

252
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:31,951
Quite.

253
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:35,255
After our last session,
he started the Vietnamese war.

254
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,761
Seek him out...

255
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:41,357
and... when you find him,
please...

256
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,925
I would love
to eat his cookies...

257
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:47,905
with some fava beans
and a nice chilled Fresca.

258
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:58,016
I just got to ask.

259
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,018
What does human flesh
taste like?

260
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:01,747
Chicken.

261
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,546
Are we going to see Mortars?

262
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:07,649
Follow the lead of some
psychotic, mind-twisting...

263
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:08,955
jumpsuit-wearing sociopath?

264
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,120
Forget it.

265
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,959
I've only got forty-eight hours.

266
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,123
Wrong, Sarge.

267
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,792
Forty-seven hours,
twenty-nine minutes.

268
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,970
I'm looking for the man
that killed my ex-partner.

269
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,471
Come on, spud.

270
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:23,474
She was going to meet some
stoolie at Squealer's Hotel.

271
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,874
I don't need some
hotshot cowboy from...

272
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:27,037
Don't fry me!

273
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:28,205
- Not validated.
- What?

274
00:22:28,246 --> 00:22:31,147
Val-i-dat-ed.

275
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:38,051
I don't need some hotshot
from Narco in my way.

276
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:40,820
You're not the only one
who's lost a partner.

277
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,019
You got anything smaller?

278
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,727
Keep it.

279
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:45,923
Anything larger?

280
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:55,866
Claire and I rode together
for seven years.

281
00:22:55,907 --> 00:22:58,205
York and I
were in academy together.

282
00:22:58,243 --> 00:23:00,143
Then we partnered
for five years.

283
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:02,544
Before that,
we dodged the draft together.

284
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:05,675
Before that, we played
high school football together.

285
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:08,686
Before that, we were
in grade school together...

286
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,589
and before that,
we breast-fed together.

287
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:15,092
What happened to your partner?

288
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:16,617
The hell of it is I don't know.

289
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:18,219
I came home one night,
and she was gone.

290
00:23:18,263 --> 00:23:20,231
You two were living together?

291
00:23:20,265 --> 00:23:23,234
She used to sleep at my feet
and lick my toes...

292
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:25,236
though sometimes
she'd forget about me...

293
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,794
and just lick herself for hours.

294
00:23:26,838 --> 00:23:30,239
Personally, I don't think
it's a good idea...

295
00:23:30,275 --> 00:23:32,539
to get that involved
with your partner.

296
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:35,045
You try not getting
involved with a partner...

297
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,048
who saves your life
one minute...

298
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,175
then nuzzles your crotch
the next.

299
00:23:39,217 --> 00:23:41,583
Billy and I weren't like that.

300
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,884
She left the force
five years ago.

301
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,890
We didn't see each other
much after that.

302
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:49,018
When we did, she was always
excited to see me.

303
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:52,029
When Claire was excited,
she'd pee on my leg.

304
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:53,394
What do you think
happened to her?

305
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,400
Maybe she just took off.

306
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:58,403
I hadn't been paying
enough attention to her.

307
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,337
I realized
how neglected she felt...

308
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:02,567
the night she shit in my shoes.

309
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:05,599
My gut tells me we were getting
too close to someone.

310
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:07,009
When she disappeared...

311
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:09,036
I had a feeling
we were being followed.

312
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:12,882
I think we're being
followed now.

313
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:14,044
Don't look.

314
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:15,552
Just play it cool.

315
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:21,015
So, did you catch that Stallone
retrospective at the Omni?

316
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:24,495
No.
Sounds fascinating, though.

317
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:26,019
I'm going to try and lose them.

318
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:32,968
Nice driving.

319
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:34,528
Thanks.

320
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:39,439
You really got me going

321
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:42,606
You got me so I don't know
what I'm doing

322
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:44,274
You

323
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,250
Really got me now

324
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:49,720
You got me
so I can't sleep at night

325
00:24:49,754 --> 00:24:51,016
Oh, yeah

326
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:52,683
You, you've really got me now

327
00:24:52,724 --> 00:24:56,023
You got me so I don't know
what I'm doing

328
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:58,029
Oh, yeah

329
00:24:58,063 --> 00:24:59,860
You really got me now

330
00:24:59,898 --> 00:25:02,765
You got me
so I can't sleep at night

331
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:03,927
You really got me

332
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:05,266
You really got me

333
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:06,634
You really got me

334
00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:13,543
Don't ever set me free...

335
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,277
What the hell?

336
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:27,489
General.

337
00:25:30,962 --> 00:25:32,429
How's your health, Mike?

338
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:34,193
Fine.

339
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:42,599
Sea Monkeys?

340
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:44,006
Piranha.

341
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:46,977
Their lives exude
a beautiful simplicity...

342
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:48,980
savage, ruthless...

343
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:51,983
existing only to devour
and destroy...

344
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:54,952
to taste blood, to rend flesh.

345
00:25:54,986 --> 00:25:56,453
Sounds like me, right?

346
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:13,034
In its own environment...

347
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:14,834
the piranha
is a ferocious killer.

348
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:17,307
In mine,
just a helpless little fish.

349
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:20,675
There's a lesson to be learned
from that, don't you think?

350
00:26:25,984 --> 00:26:29,181
I have a concern
that you might alleviate.

351
00:26:30,655 --> 00:26:33,681
It seems certain information
was shared...

352
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:35,818
with an individual
who might have jeopardized...

353
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,088
the cookie operation.

354
00:26:37,128 --> 00:26:39,892
While that individual
has been eliminated...

355
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:45,595
we have yet to recover
a very important item.

356
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:48,999
Where's the microfilm, Mike?

357
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,440
I don't know.
I gave it to York.

358
00:26:51,476 --> 00:26:52,909
I thought
she was one of your men.

359
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:55,242
Act in haste, repent in leisure.

360
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,680
But he who hesitates is lost.

361
00:26:57,716 --> 00:26:59,240
Never judge a book by its cover.

362
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,581
What you see is what you get.

363
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,314
Loose lips sink ships.

364
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:03,651
Life is very short...

365
00:27:03,688 --> 00:27:07,954
and there's no time for fussing
and fighting, my friend.

366
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:15,091
Sorry, Mike.
No good.

367
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:19,895
You've been careless, sloppy.

368
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:21,929
We just can't have that.

369
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:26,068
Where's the microfilm, Mike?

370
00:27:59,277 --> 00:28:01,973
Does this have anything to do
with the Billy York killing?

371
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:03,708
Nah.
Domestic dispute.

372
00:28:05,383 --> 00:28:08,079
OK, I'm going to try
and talk them out.

373
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:11,680
Hold your fire
until I give the order.

374
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:22,424
Can I have one that's made
in America, please?

375
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:23,764
You up there.

376
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:26,168
I order you
to throw your hands down...

377
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:28,195
and come out
with your weapons up.

378
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:38,544
Who fired that shot?

379
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:42,349
Sergeant...
That... that was me that...

380
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,116
- Give me the gun.
- I was just...

381
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:46,487
Give me the gun.

382
00:28:46,524 --> 00:28:49,823
When you learn to follow orders,
you can have it back.

383
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:57,134
Oh, so we think that's funny,
do we, Officer Davis?

384
00:28:57,168 --> 00:29:00,763
Maybe we'd all like to know
what's so funny.

385
00:29:00,805 --> 00:29:04,434
Maybe Officer Davis
can make us all laugh.

386
00:29:08,446 --> 00:29:11,415
Nice to see all those
smiling faces out there.

387
00:29:11,449 --> 00:29:14,646
What do you call 2,000 lawyers
at the bottom of the sea?

388
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:16,711
A good start.

389
00:29:18,356 --> 00:29:20,722
Say, why'd the guy give a name
to his penis?

390
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:24,718
He didn't want a stranger
making most of his decisions.

391
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,754
Thanks a lot.
You've been great.

392
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:29,824
Make sure he doesn't
get any doughnuts.

393
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:38,432
You could have gone
a little lighter on the guys.

394
00:29:38,476 --> 00:29:39,943
That's how it starts, Colt.

395
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:41,445
You lighten up,
next thing you know...

396
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:43,811
all the rules
are out the window.

397
00:29:44,816 --> 00:29:45,942
Tight ass.

398
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:47,451
You say something?

399
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:50,848
Pencilneck.

400
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:55,991
Butthead.

401
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,568
What is it with you guys?

402
00:30:04,602 --> 00:30:06,126
I run a respectable place.

403
00:30:06,171 --> 00:30:08,002
What are you rousting me for?

404
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:09,666
I got friends downtown.

405
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:11,698
I don't know
what you're talking about.

406
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:13,370
We haven't said anything yet.

407
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:14,844
I got nothing to say.

408
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:16,141
Park the tongue, buddy.

409
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:19,779
I'm Sergeant Colt.
This is Sergeant Luger.

410
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:22,514
You know a woman
by the name of Billy York?

411
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:23,851
You got a picture?

412
00:30:25,523 --> 00:30:27,514
Oh. Ahem. Here we go.

413
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:36,295
That her?

414
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:37,824
No. That's her picture.

415
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:41,004
Nope. Don't know her.

416
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:44,372
Well, maybe this
will refresh your memory.

417
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:52,482
I don't know.
She's a little out of focus.

418
00:31:08,733 --> 00:31:11,793
Is this the Billy York
informant shootout?

419
00:31:11,836 --> 00:31:13,667
I don't know.
I just got here.

420
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:14,933
Wait a second.

421
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:16,133
Hey, Larry.

422
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:22,339
Is this the Billy York
informant shootout?

423
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,848
No.
Check out the third floor.

424
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,043
Thanks.

425
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:36,887
Beat it.

426
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:40,264
This is an FBI case.

427
00:31:40,298 --> 00:31:42,789
All right, bring him on out.

428
00:31:47,805 --> 00:31:50,239
Is he the Billy York informant?

429
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:52,038
Get your shit together.

430
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:53,634
That's Becker, four-oh-three.

431
00:31:57,448 --> 00:31:59,075
Hey, you!

432
00:32:02,987 --> 00:32:04,716
Not so fast.

433
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:07,756
That's better.

434
00:32:10,995 --> 00:32:13,156
Nope.
I'll handle this.

435
00:32:13,197 --> 00:32:15,859
All right, Becker, open up!
Police!

436
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:26,300
Now that we've tried it
your way, let's try mine.

437
00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:29,980
Who is it?

438
00:32:30,014 --> 00:32:31,641
Room service.

439
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,588
What?
I don't know nothin'.

440
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:40,250
I didn't see nothin'.
I ain't sayin' nothin'.

441
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:43,089
Nothing, the word is nothing,
not nothin'.

442
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:45,755
There's an i-n-g
on the end of it. Nothing.

443
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:48,061
OK. Nothing.

444
00:32:52,036 --> 00:32:53,503
OK, you happy?

445
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:54,766
That's better.

446
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,205
That's not what you told York.

447
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:00,074
L... I don't know no York,
and where's my food?

448
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:02,579
We ate it, and please,
no double negatives.

449
00:33:02,613 --> 00:33:05,241
Sorry.
I don't know any York.

450
00:33:05,283 --> 00:33:07,251
You don't know any York?

451
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:09,976
These matches say you're lying.

452
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:14,016
Oh... York.

453
00:33:14,058 --> 00:33:17,186
She was supposed to meet you
here the night she died. Why?

454
00:33:17,228 --> 00:33:18,525
It's where I live.

455
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:20,087
Yeah, but why you?

456
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:22,964
The other guy couldn't come up
with the security deposit.

457
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:25,970
What do you know about a piece
of microfilm?

458
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,471
It's small and brittle...

459
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:29,905
and it's used
in a lot of Bond films.

460
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:40,480
All right,
I did some money laundering...

461
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:43,078
for your standard
ex-military psycho types.

462
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:44,611
Give me a name.

463
00:33:44,655 --> 00:33:46,179
Weren't your parents
supposed to do that?

464
00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:47,418
Who are you working with?

465
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:50,086
There's been three attempts
on my life.

466
00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:53,996
Come with us. There won't be
any successful ones.

467
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:56,500
This thing is big.
It's really big.

468
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:59,002
It's bigger than Watergate.
It's bigger than Oprah.

469
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,436
There's nothing you can do.

470
00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:01,938
They're too strong
and powerful...

471
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:05,409
and they're too...
je ne sais quoi.

472
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:07,104
We can protect you.

473
00:34:10,481 --> 00:34:14,247
Le commedia est finie.

474
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:20,483
Guess that's the last time
he'll trust a cop.

475
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:21,958
Give it to me straight.

476
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:23,961
Is this it, the big checkout?

477
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:26,520
Level with me.
How bad is it?

478
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:29,032
It's not bad.
You'll be fine.

479
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,865
You'll be back
on your feet in no time.

480
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,216
Your ticket.

481
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:55,225
Don't bury me.
I'll only be a minute.

482
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:56,419
Yes, sir.

483
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:06,937
Closer together.
OK, big smile.

484
00:35:06,971 --> 00:35:08,529
Beautiful.

485
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:12,309
They bought it right away.

486
00:35:12,343 --> 00:35:14,106
Those two tried
to make a getaway.

487
00:35:15,713 --> 00:35:17,772
They gave me a new partner, too.

488
00:35:20,184 --> 00:35:21,947
This is Sport.

489
00:35:21,986 --> 00:35:23,453
She likes you.

490
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:24,750
I've done worse.

491
00:35:29,594 --> 00:35:31,061
What are we looking at?

492
00:35:31,095 --> 00:35:33,893
A mixed breed...
Rottweiler and Chihuahua.

493
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:35,694
They must have used a lubricant.

494
00:35:35,733 --> 00:35:37,633
I'm talking about the case.

495
00:35:37,668 --> 00:35:39,932
Seeing Sport makes me think
I could love again.

496
00:35:44,775 --> 00:35:46,743
What do you have, Irv?

497
00:35:46,777 --> 00:35:48,244
I'm not sure, Sarge.

498
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:50,474
It's a nagging, itching,
burning sensation.

499
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:52,415
What the hell do you expect?

500
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:53,940
Your foot's on fire.

501
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,925
Hey, what you got, Sarge?

502
00:36:01,959 --> 00:36:03,426
I don't know.

503
00:36:03,461 --> 00:36:04,928
Nothing solid.

504
00:36:04,962 --> 00:36:06,930
You got any theories?

505
00:36:06,964 --> 00:36:09,432
Uh, E equals MC squared.

506
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:11,435
Anything of your own?

507
00:36:14,038 --> 00:36:16,802
But I'll tell you, Sarge.
Something just doesn't add up.

508
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,240
What?

509
00:36:18,276 --> 00:36:21,439
My wife and I haven't had sex
for two years.

510
00:36:21,479 --> 00:36:23,947
I have a six-month-old daughter.

511
00:36:23,981 --> 00:36:26,449
You're getting too suspicious.

512
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:28,952
This job will do that to you.

513
00:36:28,986 --> 00:36:31,011
You're right, Sarge.

514
00:36:31,055 --> 00:36:32,249
Thanks.

515
00:36:57,515 --> 00:37:00,450
Hey, buddy, come give me a hand?

516
00:37:01,752 --> 00:37:02,980
I don't know.

517
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:06,046
This may look like a suicide,
but my gut tells me...

518
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:08,456
there's something else
going on here.

519
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:13,764
Hey, weren't there five stiffs?

520
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:15,265
Damn!
McCracken's missing.

521
00:37:15,299 --> 00:37:18,268
Hey! Hey, has anyone seen
McCracken's body?

522
00:37:18,302 --> 00:37:20,270
I need a little help here.

523
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:22,772
He didn't just get up
and walk away!

524
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:25,367
I got something important
to show you.

525
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:29,808
So, what's the big news?

526
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:32,477
You see this?

527
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:35,110
This ring was given out
to a CIA front in 'Nam...

528
00:37:35,152 --> 00:37:36,517
run by General Mortars.

529
00:37:36,554 --> 00:37:39,079
When the VC tried financing
the war with cocaine...

530
00:37:39,123 --> 00:37:40,249
they went in and burned it.

531
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:42,555
Twelve years later,
after sobering up...

532
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:45,790
General Mortars
went into the drug business.

533
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:47,263
I just could never prove it.

534
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:50,392
Are you telling me
you took evidence...

535
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:52,459
from the scene
of a criminal investigation?

536
00:37:52,503 --> 00:37:54,334
You want to crack
this case or not?

537
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:56,306
Not by making up
the rules as I go.

538
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:59,366
Sometimes, pal, those are
the only rules that work!

539
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:05,042
Good thing
we used valet parking.

540
00:38:05,082 --> 00:38:06,276
Taxi!

541
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:10,887
I guess we're making
somebody nervous.

542
00:38:10,921 --> 00:38:14,379
It's going to take a lot more
than a couple of car bombs...

543
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:16,017
to get us off this case.

544
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:18,392
Not a hell of a lot more.

545
00:38:21,766 --> 00:38:24,291
Luger, don't worry about
all this bomb stuff.

546
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:25,768
Happens to me all the time.

547
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:27,327
I'm not worried about bombs.

548
00:38:27,371 --> 00:38:30,067
I'm trying to figure out what
to tell my wife about her car.
