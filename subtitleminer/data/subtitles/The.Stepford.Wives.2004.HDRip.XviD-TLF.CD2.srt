00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,600
- Scared?
- Cranky?

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:04,080
- Jewish.
- Same thing.

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,960
But the Heritage Hill series
is very inclusive.

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,920
ln fact, there is a whole chapter
about Hanukkah.

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,880
l just love the chapter on pinecones.

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,400
They're not just for wreaths
and centerpieces.

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,040
You can use pinecones to create
a very special Yuletide menorah.

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,000
Your pinecone snowman
could be Jewish.

9
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,720
Just add one of those little beanies.

10
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,400
Or maybe l could just use
hundreds of pinecones

11
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,720
to spell out the words ''Big Jew''

12
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,080
in letters 1 5 feet tall
in the snow in my front yard.

13
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,840
That's a wonderful idea.

14
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,600
- Oh, yes, yes.
- That's very wonderful.

15
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,720
- Yes.
- She's so smart.

16
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,480
l love the idea of creating
a life-sized Santa Claus,

17
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,160
- all out of pinecones.
- OK, l love that.

18
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,280
l'm going to use a pinecone in
my nativity as the baby Jesus.

19
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,440
And l'm going to attach
a pinecone to my vibrator

20
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,760
and have a really merry
Christmas.

21
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,560
<i>Here comes Santa CIaus
Here comes Santa CIaus</i>

22
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,200
<i>Right down Santa CIaus Lane</i>

23
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,520
<i>He's got a bag that's fiIIed with toys
For the boys and girIs again</i>

24
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,120
<i>Hear those sIeigh beIIs jingIe jangIe
What a beautifuI sight</i>

25
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,720
<i>So jump in bed, cover up your head
Because Santa CIaus comes tonight</i>

26
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,320
<i>- Who?
- Santa CIaus comes tonight</i>

27
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,560
Joanna, how is she fitting in?

28
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,000
Well...

29
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,240
OK...

30
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,880
l'm among friends, right?

31
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,040
- Of course.
- Yeah.

32
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,400
So...

33
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,120
Joanna and l had this big talk,

34
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,760
and we were really open
with each other.

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,560
l mean, we really got it all out.

36
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,080
And l think from now on...

37
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,080
...she's gonna be very, very different.

38
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,760
You think Joanna's
really going to change?

39
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:00,280
Yes, l do. Absolutely.

40
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,520
And how long
have you been married?

41
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,480
- Ted!
- Yes.

42
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,680
Don't you owe Walter $20?

43
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,240
That's absolutely right, l do.

44
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,640
Babe!

45
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,360
Yes, darling?

46
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,400
Walt, sit down.

47
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,320
l need 20.

48
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,280
- You know my PlN.
- Of course.

49
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,360
She gives singles.

50
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,000
Are these all for day camp
tomorrow?

51
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,280
l just want you to be proud of me,
honey.

52
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,960
Dad, watch this.

53
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,880
Ball.

54
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,200
- Aren't robots cool?
- Oh, yeah.

55
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,880
May l speak to the man
of the house?

56
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,400
- Snot-butt.
- Funkmaster Markowitz.

57
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,520
- Stone-cold Thriller Killer Kresbo.
- Cupcakes, anyone?

58
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,480
- Cupcakes!
- Cupcakes.

59
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,960
Hey, right on time.

60
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,680
Jo, these are smoking.

61
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,960
- Why don't you make stuff like this?
- Why don't you?

62
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,680
Because l have a penis.

63
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,360
- We should get moving.
- Yeah, we got a meeting.

64
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,560
- At the Men's Association.
- When will you be home, honey?

65
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,960
When l'm home.

66
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,160
Call a sitter.

67
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,040
Bobbie, are you sure about this?

68
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,240
We're not spying. We're just visiting.

69
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,200
Fellas, l can't tell you
how happy we are

70
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,680
to welcome all of this new blood.

71
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,480
- You said it, Mike.
- That's right.

72
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,200
l love, love this space.

73
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,680
lt's very Ralph Lauren meets
Sherlock Holmes.

74
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,400
lt says, ''l have taste and a scrotum.''

75
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,760
- Roger, you promised.
- What?

76
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,800
- Whore.
- Bore.

77
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,480
- Sorry.
- No, no, no.

78
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,320
Jerry, you're gonna find that
Stepford is very open-minded.

79
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,760
- Oh, yeah.
- We welcome you and your partner,

80
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,320
just like any other couple.

81
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,760
Absolutely. Any other.

82
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,560
- That's right.
- Girlfriend.

83
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,000
Miss... Miss Thing.

84
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:07,600
- To Stepford!
- Stepford!

85
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,240
You bet.

86
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,880
Yeah.

87
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,680
Damn. Come on, let's go.

88
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,240
You think this is all right,
sneaking around?

89
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,720
Add it up.

90
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,560
All the women around here
are perfect sex-kitten bimbos.

91
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,280
All the men are drooling nerds.

92
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,600
- Doesn't that seem strange?
- Not to me.

93
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,680
- Why not?
- l work in television.

94
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,880
Oh, come on.

95
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,520
You know, Walter,
l think Joanna is right.

96
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,760
- l think Stepford is the answer.
- She's a great gal.

97
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,880
Or she will be.

98
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,960
- Come on, help me up.
- We shouldn't be here.

99
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,560
Oh, come on.
Don't be such a chicken.

100
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:56,280
- l should be home with my cupcakes.
- Why?

101
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,840
Because you only made
5,000 of them?

102
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:03,000
- We're trespassing.
- Only if we get caught.

103
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,320
Damn, l can't see a thing.

104
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,920
Oh, there's the light.
There it is.

105
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,280
No, Bobbie.

106
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,560
This is like some alien freak show.

107
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,760
Why? They're just family portraits.

108
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,160
Yeah, that's what l said.

109
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,320
The lights.

110
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,840
We should get out of here.

111
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,840
Should we run?

112
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,040
Oh, my God.

113
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,920
Clarice?

114
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,280
- Hi, girls!
- Roger!

115
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,840
You scared us.

116
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,880
- What are you doing in here?
- What's going on?

117
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,840
<i>Do they have hookers or old PIayboys
or cable porn?</i>

118
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,200
Oh, please.
They barely have throw pillows.

119
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,240
- They're coming.
- The menfolk.

120
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,280
- Call us.
- OK.

121
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,040
Rog?

122
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,480
What was it?
Did you see anyone?

123
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,800
Not a soul.

124
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,960
But what's back here anyway,
in all of these rooms?

125
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,720
Storage? Sweaters?

126
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,240
Bodies?

127
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,920
- Jerry.
- Do you see that door on your left?

128
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,520
Check it out.

129
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,320
Oh, boy.

130
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,640
Why, l can't see anything.
lt's dark.

131
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,120
Use your flashlight.

132
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:21,400
<i>l feel like Nancy Drew in
The Mystery of the Mid-Iife Crisis.</i>

133
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,040
What am l looking for?

134
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,120
Look down.

135
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,080
Jerry?

136
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,560
Roger!

137
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,080
Roger!

138
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,680
- Bobbie.
- Roger!

139
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,960
- Bobbie?
- Roger!

140
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,200
Roger said there was nothing going on
at the Men's Association.

141
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,320
Well, then why doesn't he
answer the phone?

142
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,240
- lt's been two days.
- Bobbie.

143
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,320
Roger!

144
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,320
Roger!

145
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,440
lsn't that his favorite shirt,
the Dolce & Gabbana?

146
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,640
The Guccis.

147
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,080
- And the Versace.
- Maybe he's donating them.

148
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,520
To what? The gay homeless?

149
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,720
He loved this.

150
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,480
<i>His program from Hairspray.</i>

151
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,560
- Oh, my God.
- What is it?

152
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,520
Viggo.

153
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,120
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
l'm Jerry Harmon, and l...

154
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,560
l know l'm pretty new here,
but already l feel so at home.

155
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,800
Why did Jerry ask us
to meet him here?

156
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,880
Proud that l can introduce Stepford's
brand-new candidate for state senate.

157
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:18,880
Ladies and gentlemen,
l give you Mr. Roger Bannister.

158
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,440
What?

159
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,400
He's wonderful.

160
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,040
Thank you.

161
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,480
Thank you so much.

162
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,600
You may very well ask, what are
my qualifications for higher office?

163
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:48,920
Well, l believe in Stepford, America
and the power of prayer.

164
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,200
Values l've discovered thanks
to my partner,

165
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,640
in life and in the Lord,
Jerry Harmon.

166
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,200
Roger. Roger.

167
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,520
Yes. ls there a question?
Mrs. Markowitz?

168
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,400
So you two are happy now?

169
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,080
More than ever. Because now
l know that being gay doesn't mean

170
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:14,160
a guy has to be effeminate
or flamboyant or sensitive.

171
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,080
- l'm no sissy.
- No.

172
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,840
- Way to go, Roger!
- That's a man!

173
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,080
- Roger?
- Yes. Mrs. Walter Kresby.

174
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,640
Roger, l don't understand.
You were out there, you were Roger.

175
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,200
And now...

176
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,080
Now you're different.
Your hair, your clothes.

177
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,120
- You're like someone else.
- People change.

178
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,000
You can't stop Stepford.

179
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,920
<i>You can't stop Stepford.
You can't stop Stepford.</i>

180
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,280
<i>You can't stop Stepford.
You can't stop Stepford.</i>

181
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,440
<i>You can't stop Stepford.
You can't stop Stepford.</i>

182
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,800
<i>You can't stop Stepford.
You can't stop Stepford.</i>

183
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,400
<i>You can't stop Stepford.
You can't stop Stepford.</i>

184
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,760
<i>You can't stop Stepford.
You can't stop Stepford.</i>

185
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,520
<i>You can't stop Stepford.
You can't stop Stepford.</i>

186
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,080
<i>You can't stop Stepford.
You can't stop Stepford.</i>

187
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,040
<i>You can't stop Stepford.
You can't stop Stepford.</i>

188
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,600
So that's why we have
to leave Stepford?

189
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,960
- l'm not following.
- OK.

190
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,560
Before, Roger was witty
and stylish and ironic.

191
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,480
- And l'm sure he still is.
- No.

192
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,400
Now he's making speeches
in a Brooks Brothers suit.

193
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,360
Hey, there's lots of ways to be gay.

194
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,560
Don't try to make him
into a stereotype.

195
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,080
Bobbie is right,
and she's leaving too.

196
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,040
This place does something to people.

197
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:29,240
All of the women are always busy
and perfect and smiling,

198
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,200
and all of the men are always happy.

199
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:35,200
- And that's a problem because...?
- Because it's not normal, Walter.

200
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,560
lt's... lt's not the world. lt's not us.

201
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,800
And l'm picking up our kids
from camp right now,

202
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,760
and we're getting out of here.

203
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,680
With or without you.

204
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,000
<i>Secure.</i>

205
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,120
You'll never change, will you?

206
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,720
Not really.

207
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,560
Open the door.

208
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,040
<i>UnIock front.</i>

209
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,320
And you're right.

210
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,520
About what?

211
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,400
lf you're that unhappy,
then we should move.

212
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,000
Maybe head back to the city.

213
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,560
We could leave tomorrow.

214
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,480
Thank you.

215
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,200
Thank you.

216
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:29,440
What do you got there? Huh?

217
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,240
Sweetcakes?

218
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,200
lt's 4 a.m. What are you up to?

219
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,720
Just recipes for tomorrow.
l like to get a head start.

220
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,560
- On what?
- Apple pie. Bobbie recommended it.

221
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,600
l'll be right up.

222
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,920
Walter?

223
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,040
Babe?

224
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,960
Bobbie? Bobbie!

225
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,080
Oh, my God.

226
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,600
Bobbie?

227
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,160
Good morning, Joanna.

228
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,400
lsn't it a lovely morning?

229
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,920
That's a pretty color.

230
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,160
- Mom!
- Mom!

231
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,240
Good morning, my precious ones.

232
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,920
And thank you for leaving
your requests on my e-mail.

233
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,160
Adam, you wanted
peanut butter and jelly, no crusts,

234
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,400
a Snickers bar and a Rolex.

235
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,520
Ben, here's a whole-wheat burrito,

236
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:23,000
a soy protein shake and three pieces
of German chocolate layer cake.

237
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,200
- From scratch?
- Of course.

238
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,880
And, Max, you get bacon,
lettuce and tomato

239
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,800
on a lightly-toasted
sesame seed bagel.

240
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,400
But what about my action figures?

241
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,000
There's Mace Windu and Amidala.

242
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,200
- Where's Boba Fett?
- They were out.

243
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,080
- Mom!
- Here's $500.

244
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,640
All right.

245
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,920
Bye, Mom. Bye, Joanna.

246
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,720
Oh, they grow up so fast.
l think l'll have three more.

247
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,400
Bobbie, listen to me.
What have they done to you, huh?

248
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,240
What have they done to you?
ls it drugs?

249
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,760
ls it brainwashing?
Come on, hey, talk to me.

250
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,320
Of course, but only for a minute.
Then l have to get to work

251
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,440
on this pigsty. Coffee?

252
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,480
No, no coffee. Bobbie, Bobbie.

253
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,360
Last night l went online, all right?
And l found out,

254
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,440
all of the women here,
they used to be big deals,

255
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,600
l mean, big deals.

256
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,000
CEOs, executives, judges.

257
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,960
Sarah Sunderson,
she used to run an airline.

258
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,200
With that perfect skin.

259
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,440
No. No, no, no.
She didn't used to look like that.

260
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,240
- None of the women did. They...
- Coffee?

261
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,880
Coffee? No. No coffee.

262
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:25,960
Bobbie. Bobbie. This isn't you.

263
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,560
That's right, Joanna. This isn't me.

264
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,760
lt's a whole new me.

265
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,440
l'm happy and l'm healthy
because l understand

266
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,520
- what's important in life.
- Yes.

267
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,920
- Your new book.
- That's right.

268
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,160
That's what's important,
my new cookbook.

269
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,760
And my husband and my family
and making a perfect home.

270
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,920
lt's a lesson every gal needs to learn.

271
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,200
Especially you.

272
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,400
l'm your friend, Joanna.
l'm going to help you.

273
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,040
- You need me.
- You stay away from me.

274
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,560
You're driven.

275
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,920
- Well, sometimes.
- And you're selfish.

276
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,600
- You wanna rule the world.
- No.

277
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:03,080
l can fix you. l can change you.

278
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,600
What...have...they...done to you?

279
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,720
Let's get busy.

280
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,200
Answer the phone.

281
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,240
Hello, is...? ls this the day camp?

282
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,600
Oh.

283
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,800
Yes, this is... This is Joanna Eberhart.
l would like to speak to my children.

284
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,960
l'm coming to pick them up
right now.

285
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,560
What?

286
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,280
Walter!

287
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,560
Walter, where are you?

288
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,760
l know you've got the kids.

289
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,200
Pete, Kimberly!

290
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,480
Oh, boys.

291
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,400
Welcome.

292
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,600
Where are my children?

293
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,840
- They're perfectly safe.
- Where are my children?

294
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,920
- You'll see them soon.
- Where's Walter?

295
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,400
How could you do this?

296
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,920
Ever since we met,
you've beaten me at everything.

297
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,480
You're better educated.

298
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,680
You're stronger, you're faster.

299
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,120
You're a better dancer,
a better tennis player.

300
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,240
You've always earned
at least six figures more

301
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,240
than l could ever dream of.

302
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,200
You're a better speaker,

303
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,600
a better executive.

304
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,360
You're even better at sex.
Don't deny it.

305
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,000
l wasn't going to.

306
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,880
Well, don't l get anything?

307
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,200
You got me.

308
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,360
No, l got to hold your purse.

309
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:53,440
l got to tell the kids
that you'd be late again.

310
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,080
l got to tell the press
that you had no comment.

311
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,560
l got to work for you.

312
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,800
With me.

313
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,800
Under you.

314
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,680
All of us.

315
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,240
We married wonder women.

316
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,200
Supergirls.

317
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,280
Amazon queens.
Well, you know what that makes us?

318
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,920
Smart, worthy, lucky.

319
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,800
We're the wuss.

320
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,120
The wind beneath your wings.

321
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,960
Your support system.

322
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,600
- We're the girl.
- And we don't like it.

323
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,080
- No, we don't.
- Yeah, that's right.

324
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,800
- You're damn right.
- Yeah. That's right.

325
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,160
And is this your answer,
to kill us?

326
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,640
Oh, no. Nothing like that.
We help you. We perfect you.

327
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,440
By turning us into robots?

328
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,560
Does any fraction of these women
still exist?

329
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,760
Of course. Almost everything.

330
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,480
- Shall we show her?
- Show me what?

331
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:46,400
lt's a promotional thing l've been
working on for when we go global.

332
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,720
Walter, l don't think you've seen this.

333
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,280
<i>Some guys ask, how do we do it?</i>

334
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,560
<i>In Iayman's terms,
it's reaIIy pretty simpIe.</i>

335
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,600
<i>Come on aIong.</i>

336
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:19,240
<i>First, we take a gIoomy,
dissatisfied woman.</i>

337
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,960
<i>Then, in a very private experience
between husband and wife,</i>

338
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:28,600
<i>he gentIy pIaces her in our
femaIe improvement system.</i>

339
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,080
<i>It's fuIIy automated.</i>

340
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,160
<i>And then, abracadabra.</i>

341
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,400
<i>Her transformation begins.</i>

342
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,800
<i>First, we Iocate her brain.</i>

343
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,880
<i>We insert a few nanochips.</i>

344
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,280
<i>Then we program them.</i>

345
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,800
<i>AIso, we add
some secret, speciaI ingredients.</i>

346
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,240
<i>To avoid any accidents,</i>

347
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,520
<i>her husband is kept
at a comfortabIe distance.</i>

348
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,520
<i>Safety first.</i>

349
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,960
<i>FinaIIy, we enhance her,</i>

350
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:08,120
<i>to fit the ideaI Stepford Wife
specifications.</i>

351
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,240
<i>And...</i>

352
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,800
<i>...voiIa!</i>

353
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,120
<i>Everything is copasetic.</i>

354
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,000
<i>WeIcome to the future.</i>

355
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,240
lt's a painting again.

356
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,880
l should explain. You see,

357
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,360
my real name isn't Mike.

358
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,720
lt's just a nickname
from where l used to work.

359
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,480
- Where?
- Microsoft.

360
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,760
- NASA.
- Disney.

361
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,400
AOL.

362
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,040
ls that why the women
are so slow?

363
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,480
Joanna.

364
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,000
ls this what you really want?

365
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,360
Women who behave like slaves,

366
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:57,000
women who are obsessed
with cleaning their kitchens

367
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,120
and doing their hair,

368
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,840
women who never challenge you
in any way,

369
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,600
women who exist
only to wait on you hand and foot?

370
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,400
- Yeah.
- That sounds good to me.

371
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,320
Joanna, you're a brilliant woman.

372
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,440
Surely you can appreciate,
at the very least,

373
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,000
the genius of the concept.

374
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,280
Picture, if you could streamline
your spouse,

375
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,040
if you could overhaul
every annoying habit,

376
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,840
every physical flaw,

377
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:23,160
every moment of whining
and nagging and farting in bed.

378
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,840
lmagine...

379
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,680
...if you could enjoy
the person you loved,

380
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,520
but only at their very best.

381
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:34,800
And the only reason for your anger,

382
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:38,440
your resentment, your rage
is really very simple.

383
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,520
You're furious
because we thought of it first.

384
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,960
While you were trying
to become men,

385
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,000
we decided to become gods.

386
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,880
Let me ask you something,

387
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,600
these machines,
these Stepford Wives,

388
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,280
can they say, ''l love you''?

389
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,640
Mike.

390
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,040
Of course.

391
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,400
Fifty-eight languages.

392
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,320
But do they mean it?

393
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,960
Enjoy.

394
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,160
Walter.

395
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,360
Walt.

396
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,880
Joanna. Right here.

397
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:31,080
- Sarah.
- Claire.

398

- Marianne.
- Charmaine.

399
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,160
- Roger.
- Roberta.

400
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,120
Oh, Mike!

401
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,160
<i>Mike, Mike, Mike!</i>

402
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:35,560
<i>Mike, Mike, Mike!
Mike, Mike, Mike!</i>

403
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,440
Good evening, everyone.

404
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,880
What a delight to see

405
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:49,560
all of our wonderful wives
and their happy, happy husbands.

406
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,560
Tonight is truly the highlight
of our year because tonight

407
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,800
we honor our very newest citizens
of Stepford.

408
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,680
ln my opinion, they are
the cream of the crop in couple

409
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,240
that proudly proclaims Stepford

410
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,280
the American way of love.

411
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,760
Now...

412
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,960
...l'd like to ask my wonderful woman,
my lovely wife,

413
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,520
my bride, my best friend,

414
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:44,440
to join me in a glorious
midsummer night's waltz.

415
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,280
Yeah.

416
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,360

417
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,880

420

- Allow me.

are you enjoying Stepford?

00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:41,320
Oh, yes. The town is so splendid.

Mike, there's something...

...unspeakable going on

Mike, what's happening?

460
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,600
l was in the garden,
and l was dreaming of your...

461

Your smile and your after-shave.

462
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,760
And l realized...

463
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,760
...l can do better.

464
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,680

- She's not a robot.

- What?

466
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,320
What, she's not a robot?

467
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,000
She never was.

468
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,960
Wait a second.

469
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,920
- l couldn't do it.
- What?

470
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,320
Why not?

471
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,000
Because she's not a science project.

472
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,800
Because l didn't marry something
from RadioShack.

473
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,160
That's a shame.

No.

00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,920
You're gonna have to pay for that.

483
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,080
Don't you touch him.

484
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,480
No!

485
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,640
He's a Stepford Husband?

486
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,480
An angel.

487
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:28,080
Now he's just...

488
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,960
...spare parts, thanks to you.

489
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,800
But what are you?
Are you a person or a machine?

490
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,600
l'm a lady.

491
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,120
A real lady?

492
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,480
- Every inch.
- Wait.

493
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:43,040
Wait, a real, real lady?
Are you a human being?

494
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:46,520
Yes, and l may very well be
the only decent human being left.

495
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,080
- ln Stepford?
- ln the world!

496
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,760
She's fabulous.

497
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,920
All of this, Mike, the wives, Stepford,
this was all your idea?

498
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:58,000
Yes.
All l wanted was a better world.

499
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:02,680
A world where men were men
and women were cherished and lovely.

500
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,000
Does anyone have a screwdriver?

501
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,960
She's nuts.

502
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:19,440
A world of romance and beauty,

503
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:23,640
of tuxedos and chiffon,
a perfect world.

504
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,800
But you were married to a robot.

505
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,160
The perfect man.

506
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:31,400
And all l wanted was to make you,
all of you...

507
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,680
...into perfect women.

508
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,600
We don't need to be perfect.

509
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,280
How could you do this to us?

510
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,280
Because l was just like you.

511
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,760
Overstressed, overbooked,
under-loved.

512
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:47,920
l was the world's foremost
brain surgeon and genetic engineer.

513
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:52,560
l had top-secret contracts
with the Pentagon, Apple and Mattel.

514
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,840
l was driven.

515
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,440
Exhausted.

516
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:58,800
Until late one night,
l came home to find...

517
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,960
...Mike.

518
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,520
With Patricia.

519
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,560
My brilliant...

520
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,840
...blond...

521
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:15,640
...2 1 -year-old research assistant.

522
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,840
lt was all so...

523
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,880
...ugly.

524
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,760
Then early the next morning,
as l gazed across the breakfast table

525
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:31,440
at their lifeless bodies, l thought...

526
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,720
...''What have l done?''

527
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,200
But more importantly...

528
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,240
...what l could do to make the world
more beautiful?

529
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,160
l had the skills.

530
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:44,800
But l needed help
to realize my larger vision.

531
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,120
And so l made...

532
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,280
...Mike.

533
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,800
Because he was someone
other men would listen to.

534
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:55,480
And then l asked myself,

535
00:41:55,640 --> 00:42:00,880
''Where would people never notice
a town full of robots?

536
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,440
''Connecticut.''

537
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:07,120
So l decided
to turn back the clock,

538
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,720
to a time before overtime,

539
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,600
before quality time,

540
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,680
before women
were turning themselves into robots.

541
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,000
- Back off!
- Sorry.

542
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,760
Why didn't you change the men too?

543
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:20,880
That's next.

544
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,800
You're insane.

545
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:28,840
l'm in love with a waltz
and a town...

546
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:33,160
...and a man.

547
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,000
So, Joanna, you produced
the hard-hitting documentary,

548
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,920
<i>Stepford: The Secret
of the Suburbs.</i>

549
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:31,800
And won... Five Emmys, was it?

550
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,120
Oh, six.

551
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:35,480
- She's shy.
- And so humble.

552
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,760
And, Bobbie, your ordeal
has lead to a bestseller.

553
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,400
You know, l just can't hold a grudge.

554
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,160
So l've written my very first
book of poetry.

555
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:46,040
And it's all about hope
and communication

556
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,440
and the healing power of love.

557
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:48,840
What is it called?

558
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,960
<i>Wait UntiI He's AsIeep,
Then Cut It Off.</i>

559
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,960
- lt's a page-turner.
- l cried.

560
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:54,520
Now, Roger, good news.

561
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,120
You ran and won.
You're in the state senate.

562
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,400
- lndependent.
- Next stop, the White House.

563
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:02,360
- Yes, this country needs highlights.
- That's our hero.

564
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,560
And, Jo, Walter really came through
for you,

565
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:09,120
so how's your marriage now?
ls everything just perfect?

566
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:10,240
No way.

567
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,560
But we're doing just great.

568
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,280
Because, um...

569
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:17,560
Because now, now we know for
sure that it's not about perfection.

570
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,240
Perfect. Perfect doesn't work.

571
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,000
What about
all those other husbands?

572
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:25,480
Are they still angry? Do they still want
all these women to be robots?

573
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,200
Of course. Men are pigs.

574
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:30,680
They're disgusting, they're frightened,
repulsive little rodents.

575
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,400
But we're trying to help them,
right, Bobbie?

576
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:35,200
- Right.
- Yes, we're trying to reeducate them.

577
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:36,520
And where are they?

578
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:39,000
Oh. Oh, they're still in Stepford.

579
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:40,840
Under house arrest.

580
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:47,720
Hey, you guys.

581
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,560
Which aisle is quilted paper towels?

582
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,960
lf l don't get the right kind,
my wife's gonna kill me.

583
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:53,920
Oh, aisle three. And l need...

584
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:56,560
No talking, keep shopping.
