1
00:01:21,678 --> 00:01:24,044
Iùs okay. Mommy's here, okay?

2
00:01:28,552 --> 00:01:31,248
I need you to be a big boy, okay?

3
00:01:38,595 --> 00:01:42,463
Get under the bed. Get under the bed.
Right now. Quick. Quick.

4
00:01:46,603 --> 00:01:48,594
Please, leave us alone!

5
00:02:03,821 --> 00:02:05,686
Where's Mom? Where's...

6
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,420
Go, Michael, go!

7
00:02:15,232 --> 00:02:16,290
No!

8
00:02:26,343 --> 00:02:27,674
Michael.

9
00:02:28,846 --> 00:02:30,541
Michael, run!

10
00:06:15,605 --> 00:06:18,199
You're going to run down the battery.

11
00:06:20,677 --> 00:06:23,510
Like you could get
a signal around here anyway.

12
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:28,176
Luckily, people out here remember you can
have conversations without those things.

13
00:06:30,787 --> 00:06:32,778
Iùs okay, buddy.

14
00:06:32,856 --> 00:06:35,620
Be careful not to unbuckle his seatbelt.

15
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:36,987
I'm not.

16
00:06:43,066 --> 00:06:46,092
We're here. How about that?

17
00:07:23,774 --> 00:07:25,435
No going back now.

18
00:07:25,876 --> 00:07:28,640
We couldn't afford it even if we wanted to.

19
00:07:28,712 --> 00:07:32,512
I know iùs a bit run-down,
but wait till you see the inside.

20
00:07:34,251 --> 00:07:36,651
-Hey, buddy.
-Hey, Denise, check out the water pump.

21
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,450
You want to come see your new back yard?

22
00:07:40,457 --> 00:07:41,981
Yeah? Iùs big.

23
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:50,688
-Still works.
-Yeah, I'm impressed.

24
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,589
I know you're worried.

25
00:08:57,667 --> 00:09:02,468
But a couple of days and I'll have everything
here running like new. I promise.

26
00:09:03,073 --> 00:09:04,404
Even that?

27
00:09:08,044 --> 00:09:10,012
All right. Maybe a week.

28
00:09:12,148 --> 00:09:14,241
Still think we can do this?

29
00:09:15,151 --> 00:09:18,052
Climate's right. The soil reports are great.

30
00:09:18,855 --> 00:09:20,720
Listen, I know I couldn't make this work
in the city.

31
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:23,588
But this is something I know.

32
00:10:25,922 --> 00:10:27,150
Jess.

33
00:10:28,758 --> 00:10:31,249
Jess, come help with these bags.

34
00:10:34,698 --> 00:10:36,996
What do you think of the house?

35
00:10:38,501 --> 00:10:39,593
Neat.

36
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,201
Help us unload.

37
00:10:42,339 --> 00:10:44,204
If we want anything to sleep on tonight,
we got to get moving.

38
00:10:44,274 --> 00:10:45,366
Okay.

39
00:10:45,976 --> 00:10:47,170
Neat.

40
00:11:56,546 --> 00:11:58,844
I think she's going to be okay.

41
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:07,917
Well, at least she's talking to us.
I guess thaùs a start.

42
00:12:08,658 --> 00:12:09,750
Yeah.

43
00:12:13,596 --> 00:12:15,894
I love it out here, you know.

44
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:29,378
-Hey.
-Hey.

45
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,004
How's it going?

46
00:12:35,652 --> 00:12:37,552
Iùs so quiet out here.

47
00:12:38,254 --> 00:12:41,087
Yeah. It takes some getting used to, huh?

48
00:12:53,436 --> 00:12:57,167
You know, bringing you out here
wasn't a punishment, Jessica.

49
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,640
Iùs an adjustment for everybody.

50
00:13:01,177 --> 00:13:04,237
And the only way
we're going to make this work

51
00:13:04,314 --> 00:13:06,407
is if we give it a chance.

52
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,980
"I'll take that as a good point, Dad.

53
00:13:13,056 --> 00:13:15,581
"You're right. You're always right."

54
00:13:25,001 --> 00:13:26,366
Good night.

55
00:13:29,172 --> 00:13:30,696
Get some sleep.

56
00:13:45,054 --> 00:13:46,851
Don't give up, honey!

57
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:51,116
Don't worry. I'll get it.

58
00:13:52,562 --> 00:13:53,790
Come on.

59
00:13:54,731 --> 00:13:55,959
Come on.

60
00:13:56,533 --> 00:13:57,693
Come on.

61
00:13:57,767 --> 00:14:00,292
Come on. Thaùs right. Come on.

62
00:14:03,206 --> 00:14:05,731
He did it! High-five. High-five.

63
00:14:10,346 --> 00:14:11,438
He did it!

64
00:14:46,249 --> 00:14:47,648
Roy Solomon?

65
00:14:48,985 --> 00:14:50,680
Colby Price. Belton Savings.

66
00:14:50,753 --> 00:14:53,278
Oh, hey. Good to meet you.

67
00:14:54,257 --> 00:14:57,658
So you said
your father grew sunflowers, too.

68
00:14:58,261 --> 00:15:00,821
Yeah, over in Turek County.

69
00:15:02,365 --> 00:15:04,230
I grew up not too far from here.

70
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,460
Right.

71
00:15:06,502 --> 00:15:09,062
Look, I know you're all moved in,

72
00:15:09,138 --> 00:15:13,632
but an opportunity came up at the bank
that I thought you might be interested in.

73
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:16,702
This place sat gathering dust for years
until you came along and bought it,

74
00:15:16,779 --> 00:15:19,247
and now, as it happens,

75
00:15:19,315 --> 00:15:22,648
another party's expressed interest
in the farm.

76
00:15:22,719 --> 00:15:24,346
The good news is,
they're willing to pay what you paid

77
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:27,253
and put another 15% on top of that.

78
00:15:31,527 --> 00:15:33,461
We just got here.

79
00:15:33,529 --> 00:15:34,860
And frankly,

80
00:15:35,598 --> 00:15:38,965
my family's looking for a little stability
right now.

81
00:15:40,336 --> 00:15:43,032
Well, this will give you the details.

82
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:46,670
Give me a call if you want to discuss it.

83
00:15:50,013 --> 00:15:51,344
Thanks, I will.

84
00:15:55,818 --> 00:15:57,786
Hey, Benny.

85
00:15:57,854 --> 00:15:59,219
I'm coming.

86
00:16:14,537 --> 00:16:15,868
You ready?

87
00:16:22,345 --> 00:16:23,744
Oh, great.

88
00:17:14,097 --> 00:17:15,291
Ben?

89
00:17:33,082 --> 00:17:34,140
Ben?

90
00:17:46,662 --> 00:17:48,789
Hey, sport.

91
00:17:48,865 --> 00:17:50,890
I thought you were asleep.

92
00:17:51,667 --> 00:17:53,999
How'd you get out of bed, sport?

93
00:17:55,505 --> 00:17:57,530
I thought you were...

94
00:18:06,482 --> 00:18:08,712
Come on. Leùs get you to bed.

95
00:18:09,352 --> 00:18:10,341
Okay.

96
00:18:12,588 --> 00:18:15,887
All right, Ben.
Now you try to get some sleep now, okay?

97
00:18:16,526 --> 00:18:20,223
Lay down. Go to sleep. Good boy.

98
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:22,522
Daddy loves you.

99
00:18:46,489 --> 00:18:47,581
What?

100
00:19:09,879 --> 00:19:11,608
What are you doing?

101
00:19:11,848 --> 00:19:14,646
-Going to town.
-I don't think so, Jess.

102
00:19:15,551 --> 00:19:17,178
Give me the keys.

103
00:19:17,253 --> 00:19:19,585
I just had them, like, two seconds ago.

104
00:19:21,557 --> 00:19:23,787
Thanks, Jess. You ready to go?

105
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,852
Jess?

106
00:19:28,097 --> 00:19:29,860
Whaùs up with that?

107
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,000
It was me, not her.

108
00:19:33,069 --> 00:19:35,469
I thought she was taking the car.

109
00:19:37,173 --> 00:19:39,471
Don't beat yourself up over it.

110
00:19:41,244 --> 00:19:45,305
By the way, your son managed to climb
out of his crib last night.

111
00:19:45,381 --> 00:19:46,746
Thaùs new.

112
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:48,542
Yeah.

113
00:19:49,952 --> 00:19:52,682
So are the things I'm gonna do to you

114
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:56,786
when I come in from the fields tonight.

115
00:19:57,627 --> 00:19:59,492
-New things, huh?
-Oh, yeah.

116
00:20:00,463 --> 00:20:02,954
I've been reading the farmer-sutra.

117
00:20:04,433 --> 00:20:05,297
See you.

118
00:20:25,888 --> 00:20:30,723
-There you go. You have a good day now.
-Thanks, Ed.

119
00:20:30,793 --> 00:20:32,784
Well, you're the new folks in town, right?

120
00:20:32,862 --> 00:20:34,727
Yeah, Roy Solomon.

121
00:20:34,797 --> 00:20:37,197
-So what do you plant?
-Sunflowers.

122
00:20:37,266 --> 00:20:39,962
All right. Let me help you get started.

123
00:20:41,237 --> 00:20:43,569
Hey, mind if I go look around?

124
00:20:48,411 --> 00:20:49,673
Okay.

125
00:20:49,745 --> 00:20:52,270
Hey, don't go too far.

126
00:22:46,195 --> 00:22:47,560
Hey, buddy.

127
00:22:49,465 --> 00:22:52,093
Hey, whaùre you looking at?

128
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,870
You didn't get to finish your cereal.

129
00:23:01,344 --> 00:23:05,178
And Daddy said you got out of the crib
last night all by yourself.

130
00:23:05,681 --> 00:23:08,013
Did you do that all by yourself?

131
00:23:11,487 --> 00:23:13,421
Nice!

132
00:23:15,024 --> 00:23:16,286
Pass it up.

133
00:23:16,726 --> 00:23:17,715
Got it.

134
00:23:17,827 --> 00:23:18,816
You're all over him.

135
00:23:20,296 --> 00:23:21,786
-Get up! Get up!
-Take it!

136
00:23:22,932 --> 00:23:25,298
-Come on, Bobby. What was that?
-Come on.

137
00:23:25,768 --> 00:23:27,167
Little help?

138
00:23:28,871 --> 00:23:30,065
Thanks.

139
00:23:36,245 --> 00:23:38,770
-Iùs all in the wrists.
-Right.

140
00:23:38,848 --> 00:23:40,315
I'm Bobby.

141
00:23:40,383 --> 00:23:41,611
Jess.

142
00:23:41,717 --> 00:23:45,346
Welcome to North Dakota, Jess.
You're from Chicago, right?

143
00:23:45,988 --> 00:23:48,684
Yeah. How'd you know that?

144
00:23:49,458 --> 00:23:53,895
Small town. Everybody knows everything.
You might want to remember that.

145
00:23:55,331 --> 00:23:58,266
So what do you guys do for fun out here?

146
00:23:59,702 --> 00:24:01,499
You're looking at it.

147
00:24:02,838 --> 00:24:03,998
Sweet.

148
00:24:05,441 --> 00:24:08,899
Half now and half at harvest.
Thaùs the best I can do.

149
00:24:12,715 --> 00:24:14,114
I appreciate it.

150
00:24:14,183 --> 00:24:18,745
And if you're looking for labor,
iùs gotten cheap with all the unemployment.

151
00:24:19,021 --> 00:24:24,357
I can't afford much now,
but I'll keep it in mind. Thanks, Ed.

152
00:24:27,363 --> 00:24:29,297
You're kicking my ass.

153
00:24:30,266 --> 00:24:32,496
Yeah, iùs all in the wrists.

154
00:24:32,568 --> 00:24:35,401
Come on, you played in Chicago, right?

155
00:24:35,471 --> 00:24:38,269
Well, I used to. I played in junior high.

156
00:24:39,408 --> 00:24:40,773
Yeah? What happened?

157
00:24:40,843 --> 00:24:45,109
I don't know.
I guess I just got into other things.

158
00:24:45,915 --> 00:24:48,713
Well, the girls' team here is for shit.

159
00:24:59,628 --> 00:25:02,188
Yeah, boys' is too, if you're on it.

160
00:25:04,533 --> 00:25:05,761
Nice one, bro.

161
00:25:10,072 --> 00:25:15,305
Hey, you know, if you ever get bored
of doing nothing out at the farm,

162
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:21,179
I could always swing by and pick you up,

163
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:25,550
and we could go do nothing
someplace else.

164
00:25:27,823 --> 00:25:29,313
Yeah, maybe.

165
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:36,391
Hey, I got to go.

166
00:25:37,233 --> 00:25:40,134
-I'll see you around.
-Yeah.

167
00:25:44,173 --> 00:25:45,800
Nice to meet you.

168
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:52,247
Hey, who was that kid?

169
00:25:53,716 --> 00:25:55,206
Just some guy.

170
00:25:57,152 --> 00:25:58,779
From around here?

171
00:26:00,022 --> 00:26:02,616
No. He commutes to shoot hoops.

172
00:26:03,626 --> 00:26:05,150
You get his number?

173
00:26:05,227 --> 00:26:06,285
Dad.

174
00:26:06,362 --> 00:26:07,659
If you want to go back,
if you're too embarrassed,

175
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:10,164
-I'll get his number for you.
-Dad.

176
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:22,604
You know, I think you and your mom would
have a lot to talk about if you give it a try.

177
00:26:27,683 --> 00:26:30,117
We're all in this together, Jess.

178
00:26:47,603 --> 00:26:50,197
So I'll go see if Mom needs anything.

179
00:26:50,706 --> 00:26:52,503
Okay. Sure.

180
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,745
How was town?

181
00:26:59,815 --> 00:27:00,975
Small.

182
00:27:03,252 --> 00:27:06,153
Hey, Jess, I'm really sorry about earlier.

183
00:27:09,058 --> 00:27:10,389
Iùs okay.

184
00:27:12,795 --> 00:27:15,059
Need me to help you with anything?

185
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:18,031
I'd love it if you could carry down
some of those boxes in the hallway.

186
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,295
Sure. Where do you want them?

187
00:27:22,204 --> 00:27:24,331
Just put them in the cellar.

188
00:27:26,976 --> 00:27:28,170
Thanks.

189
00:27:36,518 --> 00:27:39,009
Oh, God. You got to stop that.

190
00:27:39,088 --> 00:27:41,215
Sorry if I surprised you.

191
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:42,780
What do you want?

192
00:27:42,858 --> 00:27:45,292
I wondered if you'd had a chance to look
at that purchase offer yet.

193
00:27:45,361 --> 00:27:47,955
We're gonna make a go of it.

194
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:49,520
We're staying.

195
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:53,391
Now, if you don't mind, I've got work to do.

196
00:27:55,304 --> 00:27:57,101
Of course.

197
00:27:57,706 --> 00:28:00,732
Always lots of work to do around a farm.

198
00:28:00,809 --> 00:28:02,037
Bye now.

199
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:16,212
Damn it!

200
00:29:20,956 --> 00:29:22,548
Get out of here!

201
00:29:25,394 --> 00:29:26,486
Shit.

202
00:31:29,952 --> 00:31:31,283
Oh, my God.

203
00:31:57,613 --> 00:32:00,514
About the only thing that keeps them away.

204
00:32:00,582 --> 00:32:02,413
They always like that?

205
00:32:02,484 --> 00:32:05,078
No. Hell, they just want your seeds.

206
00:32:05,721 --> 00:32:07,814
-Roy Solomon.
-John Burwell.

207
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:11,018
Good to meet you.
Lucky you came by when you did.

208
00:32:11,093 --> 00:32:14,221
-You live around here?
-No, I was just heading into town.

209
00:32:14,296 --> 00:32:16,196
Got to go where the work is.

210
00:32:16,265 --> 00:32:17,994
What do you do?

211
00:32:18,066 --> 00:32:20,762
A little bit of everything. Why, you...

212
00:32:22,704 --> 00:32:25,298
You need some help around here?

213
00:32:25,374 --> 00:32:28,366
What was that noise? Whaùs going on?

214
00:32:28,443 --> 00:32:30,843
Everything's all right.

215
00:32:30,913 --> 00:32:34,349
This is John Burwell,
part-time crow exterminator.

216
00:32:34,416 --> 00:32:37,510
The crows were going nuts out here.
If John hadn't come along when he did,

217
00:32:37,586 --> 00:32:39,554
I might have gotten pecked to death.

218
00:32:39,621 --> 00:32:41,680
Well, iùs a good thing he did then.

219
00:32:41,757 --> 00:32:46,694
I could sure use somebody to help me in the
fields, but I really can't pay you till harvest.

220
00:32:46,762 --> 00:32:51,199
We could provide meals and put you up
in the workers' quarters till then.

221
00:32:52,501 --> 00:32:53,866
Sunflowers, huh?

222
00:32:54,703 --> 00:32:56,295
All you can eat.

223
00:32:57,272 --> 00:32:58,933
That sounds good to me.

224
00:32:59,908 --> 00:33:03,207
Well, I was making some lunch.
Would you like to join us?

225
00:33:03,278 --> 00:33:05,610
-Sure. Sounds good.
-Okay.

226
00:33:10,452 --> 00:33:13,250
Do you mind keeping that outside?

227
00:33:13,322 --> 00:33:14,789
Sorry.

228
00:33:23,365 --> 00:33:25,560
Got any family out here, John?

229
00:33:26,435 --> 00:33:28,164
No, ma'am. Just me.

230
00:33:33,008 --> 00:33:35,135
Think iùs going to be a good harvest?

231
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:39,874
Well, iùs been a while since
that lanÔs been planted, so, yeah.

232
00:33:41,316 --> 00:33:43,511
Thaùs what I like to hear.

233
00:33:43,585 --> 00:33:44,779
Cheers.

234
00:33:47,456 --> 00:33:50,550
Hey, Jess.
Do you mind helping me with these?

235
00:33:50,625 --> 00:33:51,717
Yeah.

236
00:33:53,095 --> 00:33:54,289
Thanks.

237
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,390
You want this?

238
00:34:03,472 --> 00:34:04,996
He won't stop.

239
00:34:05,073 --> 00:34:07,303
But it must mean he likes you.

240
00:34:09,745 --> 00:34:11,906
Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben.

241
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:03,864
What are you looking for?

242
00:35:03,932 --> 00:35:05,160
Nothing.

243
00:35:05,767 --> 00:35:06,825
Roy?

244
00:35:07,836 --> 00:35:09,303
Whaùs wrong?

245
00:35:10,238 --> 00:35:11,796
Oh, my God!

246
00:35:11,873 --> 00:35:13,465
Are you okay?

247
00:35:13,542 --> 00:35:15,737
-What happened?
-Iùs no big deal.

248
00:35:15,811 --> 00:35:18,006
I cut my hand on the tractor.

249
00:35:18,647 --> 00:35:20,512
Oh, honey, you're gonna need stitches.

250
00:35:20,582 --> 00:35:21,981
No, I just need a bandage.

251
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:23,540
No, we got to get you to the hospital.

252
00:35:23,618 --> 00:35:25,415
Well, I can take him.

253
00:35:26,121 --> 00:35:28,817
Not with a suspended license, you can't.

254
00:35:28,924 --> 00:35:31,449
All right. I'm going to get Ben's bag.
Jess, you get in the car.

255
00:35:31,526 --> 00:35:33,653
Ben can stay here with Jess.

256
00:35:34,763 --> 00:35:36,560
Roy, I don't think iùs a good idea.

257
00:35:36,631 --> 00:35:39,191
Just grab the keys and leùs go.
Jess and Ben will be fine.

258
00:35:39,267 --> 00:35:42,100
John's right outside if they need anything.

259
00:35:59,254 --> 00:36:00,585
Holy shit.

260
00:36:05,227 --> 00:36:06,626
Your dad gonna be all right?

261
00:36:06,695 --> 00:36:09,289
Yeah. He probably just needs some stitches.

262
00:36:10,866 --> 00:36:14,131
Hey, what you got there? Farmer?

263
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:18,838
You gonna be a farmer when you grow up,
like your daddy, huh?

264
00:36:18,907 --> 00:36:22,035
-Let me know if you need anything, okay?
-Yeah, thanks.

265
00:36:26,114 --> 00:36:28,105
Whaùs up with the crows?

266
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:42,223
All right, Ben. Tonight we have

267
00:36:43,298 --> 00:36:46,165
filet mignon, veal parmesan,

268
00:36:46,234 --> 00:36:50,102
baked Alaska, chicken cacciatore,

269
00:36:50,172 --> 00:36:52,367
and mac and cheese.

270
00:37:02,851 --> 00:37:04,648
Stay here, Ben, okay?

271
00:37:10,492 --> 00:37:11,550
Hey.

272
00:37:13,328 --> 00:37:14,420
John.

273
00:37:16,898 --> 00:37:18,297
Is that you?

274
00:37:28,009 --> 00:37:29,601
Hey, who is...

275
00:38:02,844 --> 00:38:04,709
<i>911. Whaùs your emergency?</i>

276
00:38:04,779 --> 00:38:07,839
I think there's something in my house!

277
00:38:07,916 --> 00:38:10,885
<i>I need you to get everybody
out of the house as quickly as possible.</i>

278
00:38:10,952 --> 00:38:14,251
<i>We'll send a car immediately.
Ma'am, are you alone?</i>

279
00:38:14,322 --> 00:38:15,914
No, I'm with... I'm with...

280
00:38:15,991 --> 00:38:17,049
Ben!

281
00:38:29,304 --> 00:38:30,362
Ben!

282
00:38:47,322 --> 00:38:48,380
Ben?

283
00:38:58,266 --> 00:39:00,166
Ben, what are you...

284
00:39:02,003 --> 00:39:03,095
Ben!

285
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:24,253
Let me go!

286
00:39:43,178 --> 00:39:44,736
Whaùs wrong?

287
00:39:45,113 --> 00:39:48,139
Help us! Take him. Take him.

288
00:39:48,216 --> 00:39:49,843
Whaùs the matter?

289
00:39:52,053 --> 00:39:55,181
What is it? Jess. Whaùs the matter?

290
00:40:04,199 --> 00:40:06,497
Oh, Roy, I hope they're okay.

291
00:40:16,144 --> 00:40:19,204
-What happened?
-Everything's all right, ma'am.

292
00:40:20,815 --> 00:40:22,248
Oh, God.

293
00:40:27,422 --> 00:40:30,858
I already checked all the rooms.
There's nobody here.

294
00:40:30,925 --> 00:40:33,155
But she described a lot of damage.

295
00:40:34,462 --> 00:40:39,229
As of now, we're going to classify this
as a false alarm, not a deliberate hoax.

296
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:43,701
Thank you.

297
00:40:48,977 --> 00:40:49,966
What did John say?

298
00:40:50,044 --> 00:40:52,877
Well, he said it was easy to understand
someone getting scared

299
00:40:52,947 --> 00:40:55,347
their first night alone out here.

300
00:40:57,786 --> 00:41:00,152
But that he didn't see anything unusual
in the house.

301
00:41:00,221 --> 00:41:04,749
Mom, please believe me.
I'm not making this up. I'm telling the truth.

302
00:41:04,826 --> 00:41:06,293
Jess, please.

303
00:41:07,896 --> 00:41:09,227
Just stop.

304
00:41:14,502 --> 00:41:15,560
Dad...

305
00:41:18,106 --> 00:41:21,007
Dad, I'm really scared.
Can we just go home?

306
00:41:21,876 --> 00:41:25,209
Jessica, this is home.

307
00:41:26,347 --> 00:41:28,542
You need to get used to that.

308
00:41:30,752 --> 00:41:34,017
But I thought we agreed that
you were going to try.

309
00:41:37,158 --> 00:41:39,023
What happened to that?

310
00:42:12,527 --> 00:42:14,654
Hi. Shut the door.

311
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,094
Maybe we shouldn't have
left Ben alone with her.

312
00:42:22,804 --> 00:42:26,865
Did you see her face?
She seemed so scared.

313
00:42:29,844 --> 00:42:32,472
I'm really worried about her.

314
00:42:32,547 --> 00:42:35,846
She's just having a hard time adjusting,
thaùs all.

315
00:42:37,285 --> 00:42:39,879
Being out here will be great for her.

316
00:42:41,656 --> 00:42:43,123
I don't know.

317
00:42:44,425 --> 00:42:48,225
-Maybe we're in over our heads here, Roy.
-We'll get through this.

318
00:42:48,296 --> 00:42:50,696
Just give her some time. She'll be fine.

319
00:43:00,542 --> 00:43:02,635
You saw it too, didn't you?

320
00:43:06,681 --> 00:43:09,411
Come on. I know you did. You had to have.

321
00:43:10,385 --> 00:43:12,444
Just tell me.

322
00:43:16,124 --> 00:43:19,025
I wish you could just tell them
what you saw.

323
00:43:20,261 --> 00:43:23,458
Come on, Ben.
When are you going to start talking?

324
00:43:31,005 --> 00:43:34,099
I promise I'll never let anything
happen to you.

325
00:43:35,743 --> 00:43:37,074
I promise.

326
00:44:00,702 --> 00:44:03,136
You heard that, too, didn't you?

327
00:44:04,539 --> 00:44:06,166
Can you see them?

328
00:44:14,882 --> 00:44:16,747
Where are they, Ben?

329
00:48:12,753 --> 00:48:14,277
Son of a bitch!

330
00:48:21,329 --> 00:48:23,388
Hey, you didn't hear that.

331
00:48:23,464 --> 00:48:26,194
-Dad said you needed this.
-Yeah, thanks.

332
00:48:28,202 --> 00:48:32,002
Why did you tell my parents
you didn't see anything last night?

333
00:48:32,673 --> 00:48:34,573
Well, because I didn't.

334
00:48:37,011 --> 00:48:39,707
I mean, look, I know you were scared.

335
00:48:40,581 --> 00:48:46,076
And I know that people,
even your parents, sometimes,

336
00:48:46,153 --> 00:48:49,316
-they don't know how to listen.
-Especially my parents.

337
00:48:49,390 --> 00:48:53,793
They got pressures
that you can't even begin to understand.

338
00:48:57,899 --> 00:49:00,595
You sure you saw something up there?

339
00:49:00,668 --> 00:49:03,865
I saw it. It was real.

340
00:49:05,306 --> 00:49:08,036
Maybe you've just got a lot on your mind.

341
00:49:21,088 --> 00:49:22,919
Hey, Jess.

342
00:49:22,990 --> 00:49:25,220
-Hey. Thanks for coming.
-Yeah.

343
00:49:27,395 --> 00:49:29,829
You don't look so good. Whaùs up?

344
00:49:31,933 --> 00:49:34,424
Did you know the family
that used to live in my house?

345
00:49:34,502 --> 00:49:36,902
Not really. It was the Rollins that lived there.

346
00:49:36,971 --> 00:49:38,165
What happened to them?

347
00:49:38,239 --> 00:49:41,572
They just up and left
about five, six years ago.

348
00:49:41,642 --> 00:49:45,339
There were some bad harvests.
Lot of people didn't make it.

349
00:49:47,581 --> 00:49:48,741
Hey...

350
00:49:50,384 --> 00:49:55,481
Did you ever hear of anything
about my house being, like, haunted?

351
00:50:00,027 --> 00:50:01,358
Seriously.

352
00:50:01,462 --> 00:50:05,023
Just, like, stupid stories.
Iùs been abandoned for a long time. So...

353
00:50:05,099 --> 00:50:07,727
-What kind of stories?
-Nothing really.

354
00:50:08,869 --> 00:50:13,431
When we were kids, we used to dare
each other to go down into the cellar.

355
00:50:14,542 --> 00:50:16,840
Why? Did you ever see anything?

356
00:50:18,279 --> 00:50:19,644
No. Not me.

357
00:50:21,882 --> 00:50:23,850
I never went down there.

358
00:53:28,202 --> 00:53:29,829
Whaùs happening to me?

359
00:53:53,527 --> 00:53:54,994
Are you okay?

360
00:53:57,431 --> 00:53:59,558
I saw something again today.

361
00:54:01,368 --> 00:54:04,826
Iùs a girl. She was in the cellar.
Something...

362
00:54:06,674 --> 00:54:08,869
Something happened to her.

363
00:54:12,279 --> 00:54:15,112
She was trying to get away from something.

364
00:54:15,749 --> 00:54:18,183
-Get away from what?
-I don't know.

365
00:54:18,852 --> 00:54:20,479
But she was...

366
00:54:20,554 --> 00:54:23,887
She looked just scared to death.

367
00:54:31,065 --> 00:54:32,930
Have you told your folks about this?

368
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,434
You know my parents already think I'm nuts.

369
00:54:38,572 --> 00:54:40,540
Do you think iùs crazy?

370
00:54:42,209 --> 00:54:43,870
People's spirits

371
00:54:45,045 --> 00:54:47,536
hanging around after they're dead?

372
00:54:49,583 --> 00:54:50,845
No.

373
00:54:51,952 --> 00:54:55,615
There's something about the land out here.

374
00:54:55,689 --> 00:54:59,455
It gets ahold of people.
It doesn't want to let them go.

375
00:55:07,735 --> 00:55:10,727
What about you?
Don't you get Ionely out here?

376
00:55:11,872 --> 00:55:14,466
Don't you miss having a family of your own?

377
00:55:14,541 --> 00:55:17,237
Nah, you guys keep me plenty busy.

378
00:55:25,352 --> 00:55:28,446
Thank you. For listening.

379
00:55:30,791 --> 00:55:32,019
Anytime.

380
00:55:49,777 --> 00:55:53,076
-Almost ready.
-Yes! Thaùs what I'm talking about.

381
00:55:57,418 --> 00:55:59,477
I really like being here, Roy.

382
00:55:59,553 --> 00:56:02,750
You guys make me feel like family.
I'm grateful.

383
00:56:02,823 --> 00:56:04,791
Lucky to have you, John.

384
00:56:05,526 --> 00:56:09,860
Leùs see how good the harvest is,
and maybe I can afford to keep you on.

385
00:56:09,930 --> 00:56:13,457
Don't worry about me.
You just take care of your family.

386
00:57:41,655 --> 00:57:43,350
<i>Help me.</i>

387
00:58:05,979 --> 00:58:07,139
Hello?

388
00:58:19,193 --> 00:58:21,184
What do you want from me?

389
00:59:15,816 --> 00:59:16,874
Hey.

390
00:59:22,623 --> 00:59:23,885
You okay?

391
00:59:29,630 --> 00:59:31,222
Can you hear me?

392
00:59:42,242 --> 00:59:43,709
Whaùs wrong?

393
01:00:18,078 --> 01:00:19,306
Is she okay?

394
01:00:19,379 --> 01:00:22,143
The lacerations are superficial.
So she'll be just fine.

395
01:00:22,215 --> 01:00:23,807
Oh, thank God.

396
01:00:24,751 --> 01:00:26,378
Is there any reason...

397
01:00:26,453 --> 01:00:29,513
Has there been any trouble
in the family recently

398
01:00:29,590 --> 01:00:33,424
that would make her want to hurt
or draw attention to herself?

399
01:00:39,733 --> 01:00:42,065
We just moved here from Chicago.

400
01:00:42,936 --> 01:00:45,461
And back there,

401
01:00:45,539 --> 01:00:49,236
Jess got into some trouble.

402
01:00:51,378 --> 01:00:53,608
She's kind of struggled a bit.

403
01:00:53,981 --> 01:00:58,179
We've been dealing with
a lot of emotional issues.

404
01:01:11,798 --> 01:01:13,789
Jessica? Your mom's here.

405
01:01:15,068 --> 01:01:16,126
Hey.

406
01:01:28,482 --> 01:01:31,110
Dad, we need to leave the house now,

407
01:01:31,184 --> 01:01:33,379
before anything else happens.

408
01:01:35,422 --> 01:01:36,480
Dad.

409
01:01:38,291 --> 01:01:39,849
Dad, I'm really scared.

410
01:01:39,926 --> 01:01:43,657
Have you forgotten how hard it was
the last couple of years?

411
01:01:44,331 --> 01:01:47,164
Me out of work, Ben's hospital bills.

412
01:01:47,234 --> 01:01:50,226
We went through every dime
your mother and I managed to save.

413
01:01:50,303 --> 01:01:54,797
Twenty years.
Twenty years of savings gone in two years.

414
01:01:56,943 --> 01:02:00,674
We have everything
riding on this harvest, Jess. Everything.

415
01:02:02,315 --> 01:02:05,045
We're only a couple of days away. Please.

416
01:02:09,256 --> 01:02:11,952
-Mom, these things attacked me.
-Enough!

417
01:02:20,634 --> 01:02:24,900
God. The doctor said
your cuts look self-inflicted.

418
01:02:24,971 --> 01:02:27,667
Thaùs what he said. That you did this!

419
01:02:30,277 --> 01:02:33,212
You actually think that I would do this
to myself?

420
01:02:36,349 --> 01:02:38,340
Why won't you believe me?

421
01:02:39,086 --> 01:02:40,713
How can we, Jess?

422
01:02:43,557 --> 01:02:44,785
Tell me!

423
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:49,256
I mean,
we thought you put this all behind you.

424
01:02:58,171 --> 01:03:00,901
Why do you keep
blaming everything on me?

425
01:03:01,808 --> 01:03:03,708
You never listen to me.

426
01:03:04,978 --> 01:03:09,074
And what? We're supposed to pretend like
we're some big happy family again?

427
01:03:09,516 --> 01:03:11,108
I can't do that.

428
01:03:13,987 --> 01:03:15,079
Jess!

429
01:03:18,525 --> 01:03:19,890
Let her go.

430
01:03:54,327 --> 01:03:56,659
Maybe coming here was a mistake.

431
01:03:57,464 --> 01:03:59,557
Don't second-guess yourself, Roy.

432
01:03:59,633 --> 01:04:03,296
Why not? Everybody else around here does.

433
01:04:03,370 --> 01:04:05,395
Don't attack me over this.

434
01:04:06,940 --> 01:04:08,669
I should have sold.

435
01:04:11,011 --> 01:04:13,377
-Damn it.
-What?

436
01:04:20,153 --> 01:04:23,987
Right after we got here,
there was another offer on the place.

437
01:04:26,092 --> 01:04:29,357
We would have made our money back,
plus another 15%.

438
01:04:36,336 --> 01:04:39,203
And you didn't even mention this to me?

439
01:04:39,272 --> 01:04:42,799
How could I?
You would have taken the offer on the spot.

440
01:04:43,610 --> 01:04:46,773
So you make this decision
without even telling me?

441
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:50,647
I held this family together for two years
while you were looking for a job.

442
01:04:50,717 --> 01:04:55,654
And then I come all the way out here
when you decided this was the answer.

443
01:04:55,722 --> 01:04:59,556
And now we had another option
and you didn't even tell me about it?

444
01:04:59,626 --> 01:05:01,856
You held this family together?

445
01:05:02,662 --> 01:05:06,189
Is that why you and Jess can't even be in
the same room for more than five minutes?

446
01:05:06,266 --> 01:05:08,393
No wonder the girl's a mess.

447
01:05:12,205 --> 01:05:15,641
Damn, Denise. Denise, I'm sorry.

448
01:05:18,812 --> 01:05:20,040
Damn it.

449
01:05:37,931 --> 01:05:39,023
Damn.

450
01:05:44,304 --> 01:05:45,794
Everything okay, Roy?

451
01:05:45,872 --> 01:05:49,330
No matter what I do,
I can't keep this family together.

452
01:06:10,063 --> 01:06:11,792
Hey. You all right?

453
01:06:12,899 --> 01:06:14,628
Do you want a ride?

454
01:06:18,104 --> 01:06:20,072
So where are we going?

455
01:06:20,140 --> 01:06:22,301
Feed store.

456
01:06:22,375 --> 01:06:23,467
Why?

457
01:06:27,847 --> 01:06:29,781
Bobby, I'm gonna tell you something.

458
01:06:29,849 --> 01:06:33,785
And I need you to believe me,
because nobody else does.

459
01:06:33,853 --> 01:06:34,911
Okay.

460
01:06:34,988 --> 01:06:37,286
I don't think the Rollins just up and left.

461
01:06:37,357 --> 01:06:39,757
What are you talking about, Jess?

462
01:06:40,193 --> 01:06:42,286
I think something really terrible
happened to them.

463
01:06:42,362 --> 01:06:44,956
I think they're dead. I've seen them.

464
01:06:46,266 --> 01:06:47,995
You've seen ghosts?

465
01:06:55,141 --> 01:06:59,077
-Have you talked to your parents?
-I've tried but they won't listen to me.

466
01:06:59,145 --> 01:07:00,203
Why?

467
01:07:01,748 --> 01:07:04,649
Back in Chicago, I messed up.

468
01:07:09,422 --> 01:07:13,984
Like, six months ago, my mom was picking
up my dad from the airport.

469
01:07:14,060 --> 01:07:17,894
And his flight was late,
so she called to see if I could

470
01:07:17,964 --> 01:07:21,661
pick up my little brother
from the babysitter's house.

471
01:07:21,735 --> 01:07:26,763
And I should have told her
that I'd been drinking with my friends but...

472
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:29,468
I mean, it wasn't like
I was wasted or anything,

473
01:07:29,542 --> 01:07:30,941
and I thought I was okay to drive.

474
01:07:31,011 --> 01:07:36,574
But we got in a wreck,
and Ben had to go to the hospital.

475
01:07:38,284 --> 01:07:40,616
And he hasn't talked since then.

476
01:07:43,156 --> 01:07:47,024
I mean, they just haven't let it go yet.

477
01:07:49,763 --> 01:07:52,163
Everybody makes mistakes, Jess.

478
01:07:58,405 --> 01:07:59,497
Yeah.

479
01:08:00,006 --> 01:08:02,304
Your sister's going to be okay.

480
01:08:02,842 --> 01:08:04,309
Right, Benny?

481
01:08:06,413 --> 01:08:08,142
Say, "Right, Mama."

482
01:08:20,794 --> 01:08:23,024
What are you pointing at, Ben?

483
01:08:25,298 --> 01:08:27,266
What do you see?

484
01:08:28,935 --> 01:08:30,835
What does it look like?

485
01:09:05,105 --> 01:09:06,595
What the hell?

486
01:09:52,152 --> 01:09:55,053
Okay, honey.
Lie down for your nap, sweetie.

487
01:09:56,156 --> 01:09:58,317
You okay? All right.

488
01:10:59,986 --> 01:11:03,285
The woman in this watch,
I remember seeing her here.

489
01:11:06,059 --> 01:11:07,219
There!

490
01:11:09,996 --> 01:11:11,361
Thaùs her.

491
01:11:16,536 --> 01:11:17,798
Oh, my God.

492
01:11:17,870 --> 01:11:20,100
-What is it?
-I got to get home.

493
01:11:24,344 --> 01:11:27,438
Ben, honey. We got to get out of here.

494
01:11:29,382 --> 01:11:31,373
Honey, come on.

495
01:12:15,395 --> 01:12:18,660
Mama will be right there.
Mama will be right there.

496
01:12:19,932 --> 01:12:22,628
All right. Stay right there. All right, okay.

497
01:12:22,702 --> 01:12:26,138
Mama will be right there.
You stay right there.

498
01:12:26,906 --> 01:12:28,567
Oh, my God, John.

499
01:12:29,442 --> 01:12:31,205
Where are you going?

500
01:12:33,046 --> 01:12:35,173
Where are you going, Mary?

501
01:12:37,050 --> 01:12:38,142
What?

502
01:12:40,987 --> 01:12:42,454
What is this?

503
01:12:44,791 --> 01:12:46,520
Are you leaving me?

504
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:49,590
-I don't...
-Shut up!

505
01:12:49,729 --> 01:12:51,629
No, don't...

506
01:12:53,032 --> 01:12:55,865
I've been working my ass off every day.

507
01:12:56,436 --> 01:12:59,166
-Iùs never good enough for you, is it?
-Oh, God.

508
01:13:00,973 --> 01:13:04,807
Did you really think
that I could ever let you leave me?

509
01:13:13,586 --> 01:13:14,848
Michael.

510
01:13:23,830 --> 01:13:26,458
Open this door! Open this door, Mary!

511
01:13:37,977 --> 01:13:39,035
Mom?

512
01:13:43,015 --> 01:13:44,073
Dad?

513
01:13:55,928 --> 01:13:56,986
Mom?

514
01:14:08,641 --> 01:14:09,699
Mom?

515
01:14:11,244 --> 01:14:12,302
Ben?

516
01:14:49,115 --> 01:14:50,139
Go!

517
01:15:05,998 --> 01:15:07,625
Bobby, wait!

518
01:15:07,700 --> 01:15:08,962
-What?
-My brother.

519
01:15:09,035 --> 01:15:12,402
-He's not here. Leùs go.
-Bobby, watch out!

520
01:15:22,014 --> 01:15:24,505
Open the door!

521
01:15:36,996 --> 01:15:38,054
Mom?

522
01:15:55,548 --> 01:15:56,606
Mom.

523
01:15:57,016 --> 01:15:58,278
Oh, Jess.

524
01:15:59,719 --> 01:16:01,949
I know what you were seeing.

525
01:16:02,021 --> 01:16:05,548
I've seen it, too.
I'm so sorry I didn't trust you.

526
01:16:12,965 --> 01:16:14,990
Mom, I've got to find a way out of here.

527
01:16:15,067 --> 01:16:16,466
-Okay?
-Okay.

528
01:16:20,106 --> 01:16:24,702
Mary. Do you think
I would let you walk out on this family?

529
01:16:28,581 --> 01:16:30,481
Open the door, Lindsay.

530
01:16:36,322 --> 01:16:38,017
Open the door!

531
01:17:13,092 --> 01:17:14,957
You're not leaving me.

532
01:18:23,295 --> 01:18:26,093
Be quiet, sweetheart. Be quiet.

533
01:18:38,044 --> 01:18:40,308
Bobby? Bobby!

534
01:18:46,385 --> 01:18:48,979
Where are they, Bobby? Where are they?

535
01:19:03,669 --> 01:19:04,863
Denise?

536
01:19:06,539 --> 01:19:09,167
-Dad?
-Jess.

537
01:19:09,241 --> 01:19:10,333
Dad!

538
01:19:13,746 --> 01:19:16,180
You've been a bad girl, Lindsay.

539
01:19:22,722 --> 01:19:24,883
No! Leave her alone!

540
01:19:29,562 --> 01:19:31,052
Come here!

541
01:19:33,132 --> 01:19:36,693
Why are you always trying to run away
from me, Lindsay?

542
01:19:38,838 --> 01:19:40,965
Whaùs the matter with you?

543
01:19:41,841 --> 01:19:44,173
Don't you like your family?

544
01:19:47,847 --> 01:19:50,782
My family is going to stick together!

545
01:19:59,191 --> 01:20:01,318
We're not your family!

546
01:21:08,727 --> 01:21:09,921
Mom?

547
01:21:18,103 --> 01:21:19,161
Dad!

548
01:21:23,943 --> 01:21:25,171
I got you.

549
01:21:41,460 --> 01:21:42,688
Hold on!

550
01:22:30,976 --> 01:22:32,739
Hey, honey, iùs me.

551
01:22:34,647 --> 01:22:36,740
Iùs gonna be all right.

552
01:22:38,417 --> 01:22:41,477
Mrs. Solomon,
I have just a few more questions.

553
01:22:57,269 --> 01:22:59,066
You're gonna be okay.

554
01:23:22,728 --> 01:23:24,389
Excuse us, please.

555
01:23:24,863 --> 01:23:26,194
Leùs get him in.

556
01:23:55,527 --> 01:23:57,722
Maybe now they can rest, Ben.

557
01:24:07,339 --> 01:24:09,307
-Hey.
-Hey.

558
01:24:09,375 --> 01:24:12,208
-You thirsty?
-Oh, yeah. Thanks.

559
01:24:18,317 --> 01:24:20,114
So, how's it going?

560
01:24:21,487 --> 01:24:22,977
Getting there.

561
01:24:24,690 --> 01:24:27,284
Whaùs up there, dude? Whaùs in the sky?

562
01:24:27,359 --> 01:24:30,089
-That. Birdie.
-Whaùs that?

563
01:24:32,031 --> 01:24:36,297
-Is that a cloud?
-Crow. Thaùs a crow.

564
01:24:41,573 --> 01:24:43,097
How about that?

565
01:24:44,097 --> 01:24:54,097
