Delectable combination of the finest products

00:00:10,981 --> 00:00:15,796
This is the only malt liquor which contains 
the seal of excellence from Uncle Sam himself

4
00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:22,470
When you pop the top,
the panties come down

5
00:00:23,845 --> 00:00:30,457
Is that Anaconda malt liquor, the only malt liquor
to be approved by the United States government?

6
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:34,072
That's right, Anaconda malt liquor

7
00:00:34,073 --> 00:00:41,882
(singing) Oooo oooo oooooooo.

00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:19,691
Gentlemen...

11
00:01:19,692 --> 00:01:24,140
Every one of you is the most
respected men in your region

12
00:01:24,141 --> 00:01:27,669
Doing business with me you will find,
you will be protected, and

13
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:32,207
you will be supplied with as much
as you can distribute

14
00:01:32,208 --> 00:01:33,402
However...

15
00:01:33,403 --> 00:01:38,308
One of us here is not who he appears to be

16
00:01:41,402 --> 00:01:46,896
Come on you jive turkeys,
what kind of rundown is this?

17
00:01:46,897 --> 00:01:48,818
- Look man...

18
00:01:48,819 --> 00:01:53,983
- I got to get back to the streets
  where I come from, suckas
- Hold it!

19
00:01:55,185 --> 00:02:02,370
- I told you dumb wops, I ain't no snitch
- Who said you were?

20
00:02:20,795 --> 00:02:23,046
He's dead.

21
00:02:25,834 --> 00:02:27,992
My god, Ben!

22
00:02:27,993 --> 00:02:30,355
Do you know what this means?

23
00:02:30,356 --> 00:02:33,066
Do you know who's brother this is?

24
00:02:33,763 --> 00:02:38,208
Will turn the neighborhood upside down.
I tell you, upside down!

25
00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:43,855
The streets will run crimson with blood
of the men responsible for his brother's death

26
00:02:43,856 --> 00:02:47,129
..a veritable one man army

27
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:50,098
You get on his bad side,
and you are done for

28
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:52,602
It is only a matter of time before
he finds out and when he does,

29
00:02:52,603 --> 00:03:00,145
no matter where he is, get ready
gentlemen because Hell is a
coming... coming... coming...

30
00:03:10,211 --> 00:03:13,862
Black Dynamite, that was the best I ever had

31
00:03:13,863 --> 00:03:15,851
- Me, too!

32
00:03:15,852 --> 00:03:18,161
That goes triple for me

33
00:03:18,162 --> 00:03:21,929
Mommas... you gonna wake up the rest of the bitches.

* * Black Dynamite * *

39
00:04:07,726 --> 00:04:11,411
- Yeah ?
- Dynamite, baby, Nibsy still hasn't paid up

40
00:04:11,412 --> 00:04:15,630
Sally, I'll make him pay

41
00:04:24,156 --> 00:04:28,020
- Who is it?
- I'm looking for Nibsy

42
00:04:29,662 --> 00:04:31,885
- There's no Nibsy here

43
00:04:37,598 --> 00:04:41,015
I am going to ask you one more time:
Where is Nibsy?

44
00:04:41,222 --> 00:04:42,635
Here I am, sucker!

45
00:05:18,755 --> 00:05:20,445
Honey Bee what is happenin', baby?

46
00:05:20,446 --> 00:05:22,485
Black Dynamite.

47
00:05:22,486 --> 00:05:27,357
What did you do to Nibsy?
Word on the street is he is
going to be in traction.

48
00:05:27,758 --> 00:05:30,818
You know me.
I just talked to him.

49
00:05:32,602 --> 00:05:36,750
Thank you, Black Dynamite
I'm so happy.

50
00:05:36,751 --> 00:05:39,922
Hey, they messin' with you momma,
they messin' with me.

51
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:45,578
Black Dynamite, I want to thank you for taking
care of the girls when I was down and out,
and ain't have no pimp.

52
00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:50,598
Oh, I almost forgot, ain't no one
saw Pimpin' Jake for two days.

53
00:05:50,599 --> 00:05:53,286
- and he even owed you money.

54
00:05:53,287 --> 00:05:55,124
I knew I forgot something.

55
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:59,416
Tiny, get Pimpin' Jake out of my trunk.

56
00:05:59,417 --> 00:06:02,776
And, tell him to bring the rest
of my money by Wednesday, otherwise
I will make him stick self

57
00:06:02,777 --> 00:06:04,361
I'm sorry.  Go on.

58
00:06:04,362 --> 00:06:08,181
They replaced the chain on your nunchucks,
and oiled the bearings

59
00:06:08,182 --> 00:06:12,681
They sitting there on your desk,
next to the dry cleaning.

60
00:06:28,819 --> 00:06:31,801
Alright, what is wrong Honey Bee?

61
00:06:31,802 --> 00:06:34,053
I've known you too long.

62
00:06:34,054 --> 00:06:37,666
Something is bothering you,
why don't you lay it on me?

63
00:06:37,667 --> 00:06:41,233
Black Dynamite, I gotta go to the hospital

64
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:45,227
It's my little nephew Bucky.
He OD-ed!

65
00:06:45,228 --> 00:06:48,023
Where is Bucky?
And, what has he had?

66
00:06:48,024 --> 00:06:53,454
It is that new drug on the street, and
all the kids are falling prey to it.

67
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:56,536
What are we going to do, Black Dynamite?

68
00:06:58,964 --> 00:07:01,245
I know what I am going to do.

69
00:07:01,246 --> 00:07:03,134
I am going to stop it!

70
00:07:03,135 --> 00:07:05,148
The only way I know how.

71
00:07:05,149 --> 00:07:08,714
Ever since I was a boy, all I ever
knew how to do was fight

72
00:07:08,715 --> 00:07:10,874
Fight, fight, fight

73
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:14,990
And when I got tired, I fight some more

74
00:07:14,991 --> 00:07:20,686
Now that The Man has got our
backs to the wall, I ain't
going to let him hurt the kids

75
00:07:20,687 --> 00:07:23,039
I am going to take him down

76
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,708
I am going to take 'em all down

77
00:08:53,082 --> 00:08:55,929
Who the hell is interrupting my Kung Fu?

78
00:08:59,311 --> 00:09:01,882
- Who the hell is this?
- Black Dynamite..

79
00:09:01,883 --> 00:09:03,757
- It's your Aunt Billy

80
00:09:03,758 --> 00:09:07,423
Aunt Billy, how many times have I told you,
not to call here and interrupt my Kung Fu?

81
00:09:07,424 --> 00:09:10,176
- It's bad news Dynamite..

82
00:09:10,177 --> 00:09:13,562
- It's your only brother, Jimmy

83
00:09:13,563 --> 00:09:17,426
He's dead, Dynamite. Jimmy's dead!

84
00:09:19,377 --> 00:09:21,335
- Scram.  Scram!

85
00:09:21,336 --> 00:09:22,778
I said split

86
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:24,455
* you turkeys

87
00:09:24,456 --> 00:09:27,099
Get out of my house

88
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,955
I'll see y'all tomorrow

89
00:09:29,956 --> 00:09:31,796
How did this happen, Aunt Billy?

90
00:09:31,797 --> 00:09:36,116
We have found him shot full of holes
in an old shipping yard

91
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,836
dead as a dog

92
00:09:37,837 --> 00:09:40,189
Said he had drugs on him

93
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:43,273
I guess, he was still on that stuff

94
00:09:43,274 --> 00:09:46,770
I thought you promised
your Momma on her deathbed

95
00:09:46,771 --> 00:09:50,627
that you was gonna get him
off that stuff, Black Dynamite

96
00:09:50,628 --> 00:09:54,656
Who ever did this is gonna pay,
I promise you that.

97
00:09:54,657 --> 00:09:59,604
I hope it ain't like when you promised
your Momma you was gonna get him off that stuff

98
00:09:59,605 --> 00:10:02,750
.. for the rest of his life.

99
00:10:10,297 --> 00:10:16,371
Black Dynamite, I want you to promise me

100
00:10:16,372 --> 00:10:19,282
that you gonna look after your brother

101
00:10:19,283 --> 00:10:26,880
and make sure he doesn't
end up on drugs or dead

102
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:31,141
I promise

103
00:10:32,771 --> 00:10:36,022
Jimmy, I am the 18-year-old Black Dynamite

104
00:10:36,023 --> 00:10:38,328
and you are my 16-year-old kid brother,

105
00:10:38,329 --> 00:10:40,355
and you are high as a kite

106
00:10:40,356 --> 00:10:41,482
Tell me again

107
00:10:41,483 --> 00:10:45,020
Who gave you the drugs Jimmy? Who?

108
00:10:59,226 --> 00:11:04,552
Your Momma would turn over in her grave
if she were here to see this

109
00:11:04,553 --> 00:11:08,134
She loved Jimmy with all her heart

110
00:11:08,135 --> 00:11:13,590
You promised your Momma on her deathbed
that you would look after Jimmy

111
00:11:13,591 --> 00:11:17,830
Now, he's dead!

112
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,500
I combed the crime scene like you told me to

113
00:11:26,501 --> 00:11:29,396
Here's what I found.

114
00:11:32,346 --> 00:11:36,917
Now this... is some heavy shit.

115
00:12:14,806 --> 00:12:17,881
Freeze, turkeys!

116
00:12:19,809 --> 00:12:22,067
I see you have not lost your touch, BD.

117
00:12:22,068 --> 00:12:23,735
O'Leary?

118
00:12:26,878 --> 00:12:29,084
The old pile of clothes trick.

119
00:12:29,085 --> 00:12:31,024
I can't believe I fell for that.

120
00:12:31,025 --> 00:12:34,960
The same trap in 'Nam used to save my ass.

121
00:12:34,961 --> 00:12:38,347
BD took our fatigues, and
put them on two dead gooks

122
00:12:38,348 --> 00:12:41,091
Then we circled back and
turned the tables on them.

123
00:12:41,092 --> 00:12:46,375
I guess you forgot about the time you and
Bravo Company left my black ass for dead.

124
00:12:46,376 --> 00:12:48,454
But, I remember.

125
00:12:48,455 --> 00:12:50,924
I remember everything!

126
00:12:50,925 --> 00:12:53,977
I remember Vietnam
like it was yesterday

127
00:12:53,978 --> 00:12:58,336
I remember that village we had cut down,

128
00:12:59,816 --> 00:13:02,321
It was a massacre

129
00:13:02,322 --> 00:13:05,699
All the dead Chinamen we left in our tracks

130
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,718
I remember their faces

131 
00:13:07,719 --> 00:13:09,937
The children

132
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:12,665
This one child I'll never forget

133
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:15,729
Poor little bastard was still alive

134
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:18,881
Little Chinese legs were blown clean off

135
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:23,314
Could still see the little shins of feet
hanging off the ceiling fan across the hut.

136
00:13:23,315 --> 00:13:28,963
He was charred from his head
down to his little Chinese legs

137
00:13:28,964 --> 00:13:30,797
He tried to get up

138
00:13:30,798 --> 00:13:35,397
But what was left of his
right leg broke off

139
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:39,931
As he lay there flat on his face

140
00:13:39,932 --> 00:13:42,312
he looked up at me

141
00:13:42,313 --> 00:13:47,848
His little Chinese eyes burned straight
into my stomach, deep into my soul

142
00:13:47,849 --> 00:13:51,802
He said something to me in Chinese

143
00:13:51,803 --> 00:13:56,426
Like <i>( speaks bad Chinese )</i>
sounded like some cartoon shit, but

144
00:13:56,427 --> 00:14:01,125
I understood his question he was asking me
I don't need to speak Chinese to know
what that question was..

145
00:14:01,126 --> 00:14:07,367
Why Black Dynamite? Why?

146
00:14:11,103 --> 00:14:13,035
We're a long way from 'Nam

147
00:14:13,036 --> 00:14:17,168
Look at this place, you must have
an 8-track player in every room.

148
00:14:17,169 --> 00:14:21,108
What is going on today is a smack problem.

149
00:14:21,109 --> 00:14:23,066
Epic proportions.

150
00:14:23,067 --> 00:14:25,344
Corruption is running rampant.

151
00:14:25,345 --> 00:14:28,643
We don't know who to trust.

152
00:14:28,644 --> 00:14:31,383
We need you, Black Dynamite

153
00:14:31,384 --> 00:14:32,787
Now more than before

154
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:37,052
I know I was the best CIA agent
that the CIA ever had

155
00:14:37,053 --> 00:14:41,923
But I thought I told you honkys from the CIA,
that Black Dynamite was out of the game.

156
00:14:41,924 --> 00:14:43,060
You never left the game.

157
00:14:43,061 --> 00:14:46,132
I known you for a long time O'Leary,

158
00:14:46,133 --> 00:14:49,342
and there is something you not telling me.

159
00:14:51,073 --> 00:14:53,025
Okay.

160
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:59,126
We heard about your brother's death, and
the last thing we need is you running
the streets into rivers of blood.

161
00:14:59,127 --> 00:15:02,603
Then tell me who did it, and
I'll just leave a little puddle.

162
00:15:03,812 --> 00:15:05,735
We don't know who killed Jimmy.

163
00:15:05,736 --> 00:15:11,785
But, I do know this. You step out of line,
friendship or not, I'm gonna take you down.

164
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:15,803
In case you forgot, when you left the Agency,
you relinquished your License to Kill.

165
00:15:15,804 --> 00:15:18,363
You do what you have to do.

166
00:15:18,364 --> 00:15:21,331
Just don't get in my way.

167
00:15:59,243 --> 00:16:05,503
Y'all give it up for Afroditey and the Moonchilds.
Big round of applause, big round. Yeah!

168
00:16:09,004 --> 00:16:10,538
Black Dynamite, you came to see me

169
00:16:10,539 --> 00:16:14,468
No bitch, I have come to talk with my friend
Bullhorn then I'll be here

170
00:16:14,469 --> 00:16:16,703
When I'm done perhaps
I will throw you one

171
00:16:16,704 --> 00:16:19,111
Ohh, out of sight!

172
00:16:19,112 --> 00:16:22,028
I'll get off in 15 minutes

173
00:16:22,029 --> 00:16:26,104
You right about that girl,
you right about that.

174
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,378
Bullhorn, can I get you anything

175
00:16:32,379 --> 00:16:35,428
Yes, I want some of that black ass

176
00:16:43,594 --> 00:16:48,092
Man, who dares knock when I'm planning...

177
00:16:48,364 --> 00:16:51,663
Main man, Black Dynamite!

178
00:16:51,664 --> 00:16:53,531
How you doin' Bullhorn?

179
00:16:53,531 --> 00:16:55,209
What do you want to eat, man?

180
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:59,108
Sister Bennett made some hog on flavor put on to this

181
00:16:59,109 --> 00:17:03,074
I ain't here for no food.

182
00:17:05,141 --> 00:17:08,510
Oh man, I can dig it.

183
00:17:08,511 --> 00:17:11,975
Sugar, leave us.

184
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:24,721
You know, man, I am really sorry to hear
about what happened to Jimmy.

185
00:17:24,722 --> 00:17:27,858
You know me an you been tight
for a long time

186
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:31,998
- So you know if you need anything
- Thank you, Horn..

187
00:17:31,999 --> 00:17:35,390
I need to know about the kind
of characters Jimmy was running with

188
00:17:35,391 --> 00:17:38,681
You know he came around here a week ago

189
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:41,836
With some cats I had never seen before

190
00:17:41,837 --> 00:17:47,740
I mean these cats looked mean,
meaner than two fat motherfuckers
wrestling over pork chops and greens,

191
00:17:47,741 --> 00:17:50,492
can you dig it?

192
00:17:50,493 --> 00:17:54,337
Yeah, I can dig it.

193
00:17:57,922 --> 00:18:01,625
That ol' half a player, Cream Corn with them

194
00:18:01,626 --> 00:18:04,580
You remember Cream Corn?

195
00:18:06,158 --> 00:18:10,750
So.. where is Cream Corn these days?

196
00:18:10,751 --> 00:18:15,630
Yo, I am running things

197
00:18:15,631 --> 00:18:18,480
Cream Corn, that's what they all call me that

198
00:18:18,481 --> 00:18:20,131
Smooth

199
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:22,399
I got my * for your pleasure

200
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,437
Stick with me baby, I'll have your *

201
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,037
Never let anyone mess with me

202
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:29,954
I will jump on them ...

203
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:37,035
Stay away!

204
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,615
Don't be hitting me there, Black Dynamite!

205
00:19:28,616 --> 00:19:30,521
Shut up sucker, I need some answers

206
00:19:30,522 --> 00:19:33,540
I want to know who the cats were
that Jimmy was hanging with

207
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:36,178
Man, I don't know nothing for nothing

208
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:38,214
Okay!  Okay!

209
00:19:38,215 --> 00:19:40,658
Their leader named Chicago Wind

210
00:19:40,659 --> 00:19:44,591
He hangs out at a place name the Hip Pocket on Crenshaw

211
00:19:44,592 --> 00:19:46,666
Now get me up!

212
00:20:02,248 --> 00:20:04,992
So, you must be Black Dynamite

213
00:20:06,132 --> 00:20:09,363
Cream Corn, you lyin' mutha

214
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:17,508
Chicago Wind, I suppose

215
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:20,249
Your presumption is correct, nigger

216
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:25,462
But if you assume that I killed your brother, Jimmy,
you presume wrong. That does not mean shit to me.

217
00:20:25,463 --> 00:20:28,705
...heck

218
00:20:28,706 --> 00:20:31,457
I wish I killed that nigger myself

219
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:34,002
Someone else beat me to it.

220
00:20:34,003 --> 00:20:35,522
Is that so?

221
00:20:35,523 --> 00:20:43,194
Well Mr. Chicago Wind,
what do you know about this?

222
00:20:45,099 --> 00:20:47,189
Some heavy shit.

223
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:50,131
But, there

224
00:20:50,132 --> 00:20:53,711
Let me explain something to you, super nigger.

225
00:20:53,712 --> 00:20:58,471
I don't answer questions, I ask 'em.

226
00:20:59,151 --> 00:21:04,938
Even if I did know who killed that
jive ass brother of yours, what makes
you think I am going to tell <i>you</i>?

227
00:21:06,149 --> 00:21:13,420
Get your black ass out of my joint,
before we beat you like a rented mule.

228
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:22,619
That's right you jive ass punk, don't be coming
to the Hip Pocket talkin' no shit, you hear?

229
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:26,071
That's right nigger don't ever, ever come...
<i>( grate slams shut )</i>

230
00:22:48,911 --> 00:22:55,607
Go get Chicago Wind before he disappears,
I'll take care of this gorilla eatin' goon here!

231
00:22:59,049 --> 00:23:03,861
Oh, you's a corn-fed fool with a lot of muscle mass

232
00:23:03,862 --> 00:23:08,437
but it's time for Bullhorn to get up in that ass!

233
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:15,874
<i>( slap )</i>
Motherfucker!

234
00:23:22,118 --> 00:23:30,859
Let everybody know, and suckas be warned,
that this is the outcome when you mess with Bullhorn!

235
00:23:41,187 --> 00:23:44,119
Gonna try catch me now sucka?

236
00:24:00,464 --> 00:24:04,379
Now you know why they call me "Chicago Wind", fool

237
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:08,105
I left your ass blowing in the breeze

238
00:24:08,827 --> 00:24:13,188
.. don't you ever ..
<i>( screams )</i>

239
00:24:21,671 --> 00:24:25,784
That black son of a bitch, he killed my best dealer

240
00:24:25,785 --> 00:24:32,121
I want Black Dynamite dead, and
I want him dead now!

241
00:24:32,122 --> 00:24:40,653
Before you support any of these candidates
find out if they are going to rid
our community of hustlers and pimps

242
00:24:40,654 --> 00:24:44,361
or are they going to destroy all
the programs which help our children

243
00:24:44,362 --> 00:24:49,291
and give their corporate friends
free rein to exploit our community

244
00:24:49,292 --> 00:24:51,369
like Congressman James.

245
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:52,370
She don't shot around.

246
00:24:52,371 --> 00:24:55,299
Power to the people!

247
00:24:56,348 --> 00:24:59,832
With all due respect to the young sister here

248
00:24:59,833 --> 00:25:02,758
- You all know me
- Yes, we do

249
00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:07,978
And young lady, these fine folks
don't need to be misled.

250
00:25:07,979 --> 00:25:11,313
All they want is a little bit of bread.

251
00:25:12,095 --> 00:25:18,574
You can't just stick it to The Man,
you also have got to have yourself a plan.

252
00:25:18,935 --> 00:25:24,809
You got to take it from the jukebox to the ballot box.

253
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:30,191
We got to move from the stovetops
to the mountain tops!

254
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:36,431
You got to go from the poorhouse to the White House!

255
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:43,676
Let's take this thang from sea to shining sea!

256
00:25:43,677 --> 00:25:46,628
Keep the faith Brothers and Sisters!

257
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:59,640
Say mama, you gonna have to work on your delivery
if you want to take on Congressman James.

258
00:25:59,694 --> 00:26:02,885
Shame is, the half of these folks don't know
what the hell y'all talking about.

259
00:26:02,886 --> 00:26:05,664
* put their head to a beat.

260
00:26:06,121 --> 00:26:10,850
So what do you do to make
a difference? Do you march? Do you vote?

261
00:26:11,182 --> 00:26:17,077
Let me guess, you're one of those Tom Slick brothers that
think they can get by on good looks, a wink and a smile, huh?

262
00:26:17,078 --> 00:26:21,447
I don't know about Tom Slick.
But, thank you for the compliment.

263
00:26:21,448 --> 00:26:25,274
That's not what I meant, not that I think
you have good looks.. I mean..

264
00:26:25,275 --> 00:26:30,019
- you know these guys with.. uhh..
- Winks and smiles

265
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,598
Yeah.

266
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,605
What about the smile?

267
00:26:35,606 --> 00:26:38,806
I <i>am</i> smiling.

268
00:27:13,426 --> 00:27:15,537
Excuse me, Brothers.

269
00:27:15,538 --> 00:27:18,037
Milks turned sour!

270
00:27:18,038 --> 00:27:20,439
This is private. How did you get in here?

271
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,780
I walked in.

272
00:27:22,781 --> 00:27:25,437
So you one of them sneaky brothers, eh?

273
00:27:25,438 --> 00:27:27,809
Or, may be you an undercover pig?

274
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:30,556
Or, may be you just a federal hit man?

275
00:27:30,557 --> 00:27:33,779
If I wanted, you cats would already be dead.

276
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:36,854
Now, let me speak to the man in charge.

277
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:41,366
Sarcastic, I am in charge.

278
00:27:41,367 --> 00:27:48,224
If you were in charge, you might as well
surrender to whitey right now cause
your survival skills ain't worth a damn.

279
00:27:49,088 --> 00:27:52,133
Black Dynamite!  Ha ha!

280
00:27:52,134 --> 00:27:55,253
It has been a long time, my brother.

281
00:27:55,254 --> 00:27:57,160
Hey, Saheed.

282
00:27:57,161 --> 00:27:59,281
You know this Uncle Tom?

283
00:27:59,282 --> 00:28:01,461
Listen sucka,

284
00:28:01,462 --> 00:28:06,702
I am blacker than the ace of spades,
and more militant than you and
your whole damn army put together

285
00:28:07,203 --> 00:28:11,176
While you out there jacking up rallies
and brow beating politicians

286
00:28:11,271 --> 00:28:15,159
I am taking out any money grubbing sucker
and hummer that gets in my way

287
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,998
So I'll tell what...

288
00:28:16,999 --> 00:28:20,280
When the so-called revolution starts, you call me,

289
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:23,247
and I'll be right down front,
showing you how it is done

290
00:28:23,248 --> 00:28:28,688
But until then, you need to shut
the fuck up when grown folks is talking.

291
00:28:32,668 --> 00:28:35,452
I'm sorry.

292
00:28:35,453 --> 00:28:38,900
We heard what went down at the Hip Pocket

293
00:28:38,901 --> 00:28:40,716
That was righteous.

294
00:28:40,717 --> 00:28:43,330
That was personal, Brother.

295
00:28:43,331 --> 00:28:47,342
Personal or not, you've saved a
lot of Brothers and Sisters.

296
00:28:47,343 --> 00:28:51,537
You need our help, we here.

297
00:28:51,538 --> 00:28:53,511
I can dig it.

298
00:28:55,502 --> 00:28:59,020
What can you tell me about this?

299
00:29:03,344 --> 00:29:06,220
I ain't seen one of these in a while

300
00:29:08,459 --> 00:29:10,889
(Mouths) I'm gonna fuck him up.

301
00:29:25,553 --> 00:29:27,511
Here it is.

302
00:29:27,512 --> 00:29:31,585
AR-48, I wish we could
get some shit like this.

303
00:29:31,586 --> 00:29:34,789
Round like this can go through
a bulletproof vest like it was pinot.

304
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:37,779
Any idea who would have it?

305
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:41,367
Who ever did, they must work for The Man.

306
00:29:41,368 --> 00:29:45,791
That right there is
strictly government issue.

307
00:29:58,778 --> 00:30:02,615
You mind telling me how this was found
at the scene of my brother's death?

308
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:13,381
Okay, Black Dynamite

309
00:30:13,382 --> 00:30:14,382
Want me to level with you?

310
00:30:15,603 --> 00:30:18,354
Your brother Jimmy wasn't a two-bit drug dealer,

311
00:30:18,355 --> 00:30:20,393
- He was one of us...
- What?!

312
00:30:20,394 --> 00:30:22,860
He was working undercover,

313
00:30:22,861 --> 00:30:26,690
and he wanted to be just like you.

314
00:30:29,918 --> 00:30:33,374
Jimmy, why didn't you tell me?

315
00:30:36,756 --> 00:30:38,242
Here's the file,

316
00:30:38,243 --> 00:30:40,999
its on the Cabroni family.

317
00:30:42,819 --> 00:30:47,642
Looks like a shipping company,
but they're distributing dope.

318
00:30:47,643 --> 00:30:51,248
Searches of the containers came up empty.

319
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:55,852
Jimmy felt that the Don and Congressman James
had something up their sleeve.

320
00:30:55,853 --> 00:30:58,039
But, he didn't quite know what is was.

321
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,563
He died trying to find out.

322
00:31:01,355 --> 00:31:04,296
So I don't need to tell you
the importance of this mission.

323
00:31:04,297 --> 00:31:06,744
But I just have one question,

324
00:31:06,745 --> 00:31:12,649
are you in or are you out?
Because the God knows you're
the only one we can trust.

325
00:31:15,558 --> 00:31:18,439
I'm in.

326
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,055
Good.

327
00:31:21,595 --> 00:31:24,652
I had a feeling you were going to say that.

328
00:31:24,653 --> 00:31:29,589
Hope you don't mind, I took the liberty
of re-instating your License to Kill.

329
00:31:33,532 --> 00:31:35,841
You gonna need this.

330
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:46,067
Black Dynamite, may God be with you.

331
00:31:51,263 --> 00:31:55,437
<i>[ thinking ]  Somebody broke into my dead brother Jimmy's apartment.</i>

332
00:32:53,102 --> 00:32:55,178
<i>Exam Room</i>

333
00:32:55,179 --> 00:32:57,346
Breath deeply...

334
00:32:57,347 --> 00:33:00,128
Ohh, you make my heart beat

335
00:33:00,129 --> 00:33:03,158
Yeah, Doctor Dynamite can hear that.

336
00:33:03,159 --> 00:33:05,774
But, I think you runnin' a temperature.

337
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:07,727
Let's see if I can find
a thermometer for you.

338
00:33:11,833 --> 00:33:14,325
What the...!

339
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:18,544
I told you urine sample, Nurse Jenny!

340
00:33:18,545 --> 00:33:20,828
Black Dynamite,

341
00:33:20,829 --> 00:33:23,670
I mean, really!

342
00:33:23,671 --> 00:33:26,827
Hey man, you sent her in here
with them titties, what you expect?

343
00:33:27,272 --> 00:33:28,979
How's my X-Ray?

344
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:31,530
Well no fragments, in and out.

345
00:33:32,048 --> 00:33:36,240
You're lucky, Black Dynamite.
3 inches to the left, and... pfft!

346
00:33:36,241 --> 00:33:38,796
We would not even be having this conversation.

347
00:33:38,797 --> 00:33:41,942
3 inches to the right, it would have missed my black ass.

348
00:33:41,943 --> 00:33:44,648
You need a new line of work,

349
00:33:44,649 --> 00:33:47,746
This is the second time this year!

350
00:33:47,747 --> 00:33:49,920
- I know, I know.
- And...

351
00:33:49,921 --> 00:33:53,338
try not to move the arm, well, for at least a week.

352
00:33:53,339 --> 00:33:56,445
Why do I bother?  There is no helping you.

353
00:33:56,446 --> 00:33:59,329
Man, Doc, you help me just fine.

354
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:01,658
See you next time.

355
00:34:05,054 --> 00:34:07,832
Hang in there Leon, do you hear me?

356
00:34:22,273 --> 00:34:25,016
Hey mama, what is going down?
Is that your kid in there?

357
00:34:25,017 --> 00:34:26,081
No.

358
00:34:26,082 --> 00:34:29,782
- Nephew, cousin..?
- I said no.

359
00:34:29,783 --> 00:34:31,644
No relationship.

360
00:34:31,645 --> 00:34:35,387
He happens to be one of the kids
at the orphanage where I work.

361
00:34:35,388 --> 00:34:38,343
He overdosed on smack.  Third one this month.

362
00:34:38,344 --> 00:34:40,808
And, why?  What does it matter to you anyway?

363
00:34:40,809 --> 00:34:42,641
Whoa mama, just trying to help.

364
00:34:43,688 --> 00:34:46,102
I don't need your kind of help.

365
00:34:46,103 --> 00:34:49,120
Men like you only help when
there is something in it for them.

366
00:34:49,121 --> 00:34:50,121
Can't be bothered,

367
00:34:50,122 --> 00:34:54,820
When they're chasing their chicks,
their bread, their fancy cars.

368
00:34:54,821 --> 00:34:59,696
No, Mr. Black Dynamite, the only kind
of help you know, is how to help yourself.

369
00:34:59,697 --> 00:35:02,083
Mama, it ain't about me,

370
00:35:02,084 --> 00:35:04,108
its about the kid in there

371
00:35:04,109 --> 00:35:09,051
do you really not want help, or you just trying
to prove to the world you can do it all on your own.

372
00:35:09,052 --> 00:35:11,772
'Cuz if you want help, I am right here.

373
00:35:11,773 --> 00:35:16,751
My momma would always say, "A helping
hand is a helping hand, clean or dirty."

374
00:35:16,752 --> 00:35:20,495
Guess my hand ain't clean enough for you.

375
00:35:22,519 --> 00:35:24,460
Wait.

376
00:35:27,767 --> 00:35:34,817
We've almost lost Leon, fortunately on
the eleventh hour the doctors were able
to resuscitate him and save his life.

377
00:35:34,818 --> 00:35:37,151
Right.

378
00:35:37,152 --> 00:35:38,969
These politicians don't give a damn.

379
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:42,238
I mean look, look at these ads.

380
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:44,913
Congressman James made promises to the people.

381
00:35:44,914 --> 00:35:51,056
Then he took away the drug awareness programs, and
allowed his bed fellows to sell crap to the kids.

382
00:35:51,057 --> 00:35:56,872
Even invested in the products, now the dope
is everywhere, even... even in the orphanage.

383
00:35:58,233 --> 00:36:00,588
Not the orphans!

384
00:36:01,903 --> 00:36:05,214
I used to be an orphan.

385
00:36:05,541 --> 00:36:09,123
You ain't got no momma and ain't
got no dad, you an orphan!

386
00:36:09,124 --> 00:36:13,196
Orphan! Orphan! Orphan! Orphan!

387
00:36:16,492 --> 00:36:20,141
No, not the orphans!

388
00:36:22,254 --> 00:36:24,910
I think I need to show you something.

389
00:36:26,069 --> 00:36:28,727
We have been trying to reach these children

390
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:33,151
But this new smack on the street
is causing too much of a mess.

391
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:38,851
The worse thing about these..these pushers is getting
these children addicted to this new smack.

392
00:36:38,852 --> 00:36:43,187
Is that these children are orphans,
and orphans don't have parents.

393
00:36:44,644 --> 00:36:50,263
Ain't nothing in the world get Black Dynamite more mad
then some jive ass sucker giving smack to the kids.

394
00:36:50,852 --> 00:36:54,566
Bobby, stop it!

395
00:36:58,512 --> 00:37:00,026
Can you deal a Brother?

396
00:37:00,027 --> 00:37:02,006
I need my smack, and I need it now.

397
00:37:02,007 --> 00:37:06,256
If you bring me the dose,
I'll do what you want partner.

398
00:37:07,505 --> 00:37:14,632
I refuse to let this happen to you, little man!
I'll shake it from you, I'll slap it out of this body if I have to!

399
00:37:14,633 --> 00:37:17,867
Stop, Black Dynamite, we tried that,
but nothing works!

400
00:37:20,032 --> 00:37:23,018
I can't look at these kids no more!

401
00:37:25,951 --> 00:37:28,496
This place used to be alive with laughter,

402
00:37:28,497 --> 00:37:30,994
and kids playing.  Now look at it, just sickening.

403
00:37:30,995 --> 00:37:34,015
The ones responsible gonna pay,
if it is the last thing I do.

404
00:37:34,016 --> 00:37:38,343
Oh, Black Dynamite, I wish it were that simple,
but it's much bigger than you or me.

405
00:37:38,344 --> 00:37:44,786
Listen mama, it may be bigger than you and
it may be bigger than me, but it ain't bigger
than you and me!  Can you dig it?

406
00:37:44,787 --> 00:37:46,433
I think so.

407
00:37:47,297 --> 00:37:50,234
I gotta split.
Need me to drop you off somewhere?

408
00:37:50,235 --> 00:37:53,051
No, I think I'm going to go down
the street and grab a bite to eat.

409
00:37:53,052 --> 00:37:55,096
I'll drive.

410
00:38:03,148 --> 00:38:05,755
Thanks for the ride.

411
00:38:20,745 --> 00:38:23,170
Can I get some hot sauce?

412
00:38:23,171 --> 00:38:24,904
Excuse me, lady?

413
00:38:31,606 --> 00:38:33,651
Oh my god!

414
00:38:34,306 --> 00:38:35,937
How did you know?

415
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:39,696
Donuts don't wear Alligator shoes.

416
00:39:20,749 --> 00:39:22,262
Sorry, Roscoe.

417
00:39:22,263 --> 00:39:23,862
It's cool, man.

418
00:39:23,863 --> 00:39:27,007
Chili and donuts ain't working
out for me no how.

419
00:39:27,008 --> 00:39:29,928
Maybe, it's time for a change.

420
00:39:31,296 --> 00:39:32,944
What have you got me into?

421
00:39:32,945 --> 00:39:34,648
It wasn't me they were after, sugar.

422
00:39:34,649 --> 00:39:38,029
You must have pissed off people
in pretty high places.

423
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:41,980
I'm gonna take you somewhere you be safe.

424
00:39:42,942 --> 00:39:47,490
Black Dynamite, you ain't got to worry
about Gloria, she gonna be safe with me here.

425
00:39:47,491 --> 00:39:50,798
I've been teaching the girls Kung Fu
like you told me to

426
00:39:50,799 --> 00:39:55,373
when they find her up in here,
we will fix those honky asses.  Chick power!

427
00:39:57,471 --> 00:40:00,220
Dynamite, are you sure about this?
Maybe we should just call the police.

428
00:40:00,221 --> 00:40:01,259
No, mama,

429
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:07,731
You can bet your sweet ass and half a tit,
that whoever put that hit out on you
already got the cops in their back pocket.

430
00:40:07,732 --> 00:40:11,534
You be cool mama, Bee here will
keep you tight and outta sight.

431
00:40:11,535 --> 00:40:15,708
Dynamite's gonna shake the tree from the roots,

432
00:40:15,709 --> 00:40:19,159
rake up the fruits, rip it up out the ground
to find out what's goin' down.

433
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,872
Don't worry bout tomorrow cause tonight, Dyna...

434
00:40:21,873 --> 00:40:24,892
- Dynamite's gonna make it all right!

435
00:40:24,893 --> 00:40:30,788
Euphoria, shut the fuck up! I know that was you,
I ain't even gotta look! I should send your ass back
to Crenshaw Pete with his hot ass coat hangers,

436
00:40:30,789 --> 00:40:32,709
bitch, would you like that?

437
00:40:44,896 --> 00:40:47,347
Black Dynamite, I know we just met,

438
00:40:47,348 --> 00:40:50,512
but somehow I feel I can trust you.

439
00:40:50,513 --> 00:40:54,175
I'll be waiting here until you come get me.

440
00:40:55,858 --> 00:40:58,673
Thank you for saving my life.

441
00:40:58,973 --> 00:41:00,588
You be cool mama,

442
00:41:00,589 --> 00:41:03,298
I'll be back before too long

443
00:41:18,461 --> 00:41:22,680
So I said, bitch, you look like you need a pimp.

444
00:41:22,681 --> 00:41:24,448
She said, I got a pimp.

445
00:41:24,449 --> 00:41:29,172
I told her you ain't got a pimp,
you got a valet for whores!

446
00:41:29,173 --> 00:41:31,570
Why ain't we got no midget girls in this town?

447
00:41:31,571 --> 00:41:34,865
It keeps coming up short.

448
00:41:34,866 --> 00:41:35,929
Can you dig it?

449
00:41:36,072 --> 00:41:38,598
- You understand the position?
- No.

450
00:41:38,599 --> 00:41:43,077
To man, all of them prostitutes

451
00:41:43,078 --> 00:41:47,460
It's okay, but I told her your feet stupid

452
00:41:47,461 --> 00:41:49,741
See?  You a righteous pimp.

453
00:41:49,742 --> 00:41:55,431
Pimp is one of the interested
I'm not alone, together we are also

454
00:41:55,432 --> 00:41:59,121
Oh, oh, oh

455
00:42:00,617 --> 00:42:04,330
The Game is at an all time low.

456
00:42:04,331 --> 00:42:10,003
Never in the history of the game
has there been such devastation.

457
00:42:10,004 --> 00:42:14,686
Tricks running low, and cops pushing harder than ever.

458
00:42:14,687 --> 00:42:17,093
And that prostitutes do not care about us

459
00:42:17,094 --> 00:42:20,976
I thought we had these
two-buck pigs paid off.

460
00:42:20,977 --> 00:42:25,528
Come to find out they clap my hoes
everytime they hit the track.

461
00:42:25,529 --> 00:42:29,861
I'm spending more bail money
than I'm getting tail money.

462
00:42:29,862 --> 00:42:32,002
- Yeah         - Yeah
- I can dig it.

463
00:42:32,003 --> 00:42:34,982
Come on, this was been my worst
fiscal year, ever.

464
00:42:34,983 --> 00:42:38,770
Last year I made a hundred thousand
dollars before first quarter.

465
00:42:38,771 --> 00:42:44,737
Now its third quarter, and I ain't
broke six figures.  Hell, I can't even
afford to get my hair fixed. Look at this shit!

466
00:42:45,802 --> 00:42:47,459
Sound like we ain't selling ass.

467
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:48,934
You know what they say?

468
00:42:48,935 --> 00:42:53,507
- The bitch won't sell her ass.
- ...her pimp will.

469
00:42:53,508 --> 00:42:55,297
Shut up *!

470
00:42:56,751 --> 00:43:01,468
I've been playing the game since you
were trading jail house tramps.
- Oh, oh...        - Ouch.

471
00:43:03,353 --> 00:43:05,563
Listen up!

472
00:43:05,564 --> 00:43:14,507
Pimpin' been around since the world start turning,

473
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:26,430
it's been turning around, and around, around, until this
little planet rotates off its axis.  As a result of its
core overheating, and it explode into cosmic dust!

474
00:43:26,431 --> 00:43:29,329
- Can you dig it?
- Yeah, yeah.

475
00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:30,868
You know what I'm saying?

476
00:43:30,869 --> 00:43:38,856
I don't need no coming and going, and if you live
long enough, you be around to see it come again.

477
00:43:38,857 --> 00:43:41,762
But what we need to do,

478
00:43:42,391 --> 00:43:47,405
is we need to collect the sides,

479
00:43:47,406 --> 00:43:54,007
we need to negotiate between the pimps
and the hoes and the police.

480
00:43:54,008 --> 00:43:55,216
Do you understand?
- Yeah      - Yeah, man

481
00:43:59,166 --> 00:44:05,461
Now then... let's stop all this bullshit,

482
00:44:05,462 --> 00:44:07,447
and take a vote.

483
00:44:07,448 --> 00:44:09,160
Hear, hear, yes.

484
00:44:10,763 --> 00:44:13,257
All in favor raise their hand.

485
00:44:13,258 --> 00:44:14,385
- Kotex

486
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:18,268
- Mo Bitches
- I can dig it, baby.

487
00:44:18,269 --> 00:44:19,835
- Chocolate Giddy-Up
- I can giddy-up.

488
00:44:22,186 --> 00:44:24,723
- Crenshaw Pete

489
00:44:24,724 --> 00:44:26,579
- Captain Kangaroo Pimp

490
00:44:29,132 --> 00:44:31,565
- Willy
- I'm with you.

491
00:44:32,023 --> 00:44:39,807
Look it, even if dope ain't not the boss,
there ain't enough tricks to go around.

492
00:44:40,508 --> 00:44:45,449
Now I ain't know about y'all,

493
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:49,749
I'll need to keep selling that
heroin to make ends meet.

494
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:52,096
Then you'll have a much bigger problem.

495
00:44:52,097 --> 00:44:55,988
Black Dynamite!  How are you my friend?

496
00:44:55,989 --> 00:44:57,510
How you doing big one?

497
00:44:57,511 --> 00:45:00,805
To what.. do we owe this pleasure?

498
00:45:00,806 --> 00:45:03,843
I just got one thing to lay
on you cats, then I'll split

499
00:45:03,844 --> 00:45:08,848
That I am declaring war on anybody
whole sells drugs in our community.

500
00:45:08,849 --> 00:45:13,304
But Black Dynamite, I sell drugs to the community

501
00:45:13,305 --> 00:45:16,399
Be that as it may, if I catch you

502
00:45:16,622 --> 00:45:20,736
I will not consider you a Brother or a friend.
Now can you dig it?

503
00:45:20,737 --> 00:45:23,800
Hell no, nigger.

504
00:45:23,899 --> 00:45:26,497
I can't dig it.

505
00:45:26,532 --> 00:45:27,839
Now who you supposed to be?

506
00:45:27,874 --> 00:45:31,207
- That's Black Dynamite...
- I didn't ask you, nigger.  Shut up.

507
00:45:31,242 --> 00:45:33,234
I'm going to tell you like this,

508
00:45:33,269 --> 00:45:39,319
I'm gonna do, whatever I want to do.

509
00:45:39,354 --> 00:45:41,762
Choice is yours, Brother,

510
00:45:41,826 --> 00:45:46,686
If me and my people catch you,
you gonna have a lot more to deal with

511
00:45:46,721 --> 00:45:50,275
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Bye, Black Dynamite.

512
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:00,833
Hold it right there.

513
00:46:00,834 --> 00:46:03,804
- It's me, Black Dynamite.
- What the hell you want?

514
00:46:03,805 --> 00:46:05,191
I want to help you.

515
00:46:05,192 --> 00:46:09,381
Why should I trust you, after you
dropped jive on me with Chicago Wind?

516
00:46:09,382 --> 00:46:12,030
Because your brother Jimmy saved my life.

517
00:46:12,031 --> 00:46:15,092
I was supposed to be there
with him the night he got killed

518
00:46:15,093 --> 00:46:18,397
But he called me and
told me to stay at home.

519
00:46:18,398 --> 00:46:20,280
I guess that I owe him one.

520
00:46:20,281 --> 00:46:22,157
It's least I can do.

521
00:46:25,667 --> 00:46:28,564
I need a list of names and locations.

522
00:46:28,565 --> 00:46:29,851
Ain't no thing.

523
00:46:29,852 --> 00:46:32,535
Oh man, everything is going to be okay.

524
00:46:32,536 --> 00:46:37,942
Bullhorn, Cream Corn here says that he can
help us find the cats we looking for.

525
00:46:37,943 --> 00:46:39,903
What do you think?

526
00:46:39,904 --> 00:46:44,456
Man, I think we should put our act together!

527
00:46:46,035 --> 00:46:51,330
"Black Dynamite Declares War on Drug Dealers"

528
00:48:16,563 --> 00:48:20,007
They broke.. into my home!

529
00:48:20,008 --> 00:48:23,127
They got.. the ledger,

530
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,310
they got the manifest,
they got everything!

531
00:48:25,463 --> 00:48:28,632
- Names, dates, and schedules
- We even got the shipping routes.

532
00:48:28,633 --> 00:48:32,405
Man, they ain't gonna be able to take a shit
without us knowing when and what color.

533
00:48:32,406 --> 00:48:39,742
We cleaned up the streets and gave them
back to the people, once again making them
a pleasant place to take an afternoon stroll.

534
00:48:41,744 --> 00:48:43,190
"Smack Wiped Off Streets"

535
00:48:43,191 --> 00:48:48,690
Extra, extra!  Hot off the presses!
Black Dynamite cleaned up the street!

536
00:48:49,744 --> 00:48:54,100
It is unbelievable Black Dynamite,
everyone looks so happy

537
00:48:54,101 --> 00:48:55,927
And its all thanks to you.

538
00:48:55,928 --> 00:49:02,113
I would like to take the credit, mama,
but there is not "i" in team.

539
00:49:02,114 --> 00:49:05,984
Oh, I can't resist,
I have to try this.

540
00:49:06,631 --> 00:49:08,426
Hi girls, what are your names?

541
00:49:08,427 --> 00:49:11,231
I am Shawanda, and her name is Brikwilla.

542
00:49:11,232 --> 00:49:15,536
Those are beautiful names,
I am Gloria and this is Black Dynamite

543
00:49:15,537 --> 00:49:19,189
My momma says my daddy is named Black Dynamite.

544
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:20,190
So you know my momma?

545
00:49:22,271 --> 00:49:26,882
Uhh, you know little girls,
a lot of guys have that name.

546
00:50:23,981 --> 00:50:27,880
This was really fun

547
00:50:27,881 --> 00:50:31,192
Thank you for the day and an evening of fun

548
00:50:32,974 --> 00:50:38,075
However, I think I should be going

549
00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:41,416
I think that it would be safer
if you stayed here tonight.

550
00:50:42,178 --> 00:50:44,428
Oh you think that?

551
00:50:44,429 --> 00:50:47,389
I hope you don't think you gonna get any of this cookie,

552
00:50:47,390 --> 00:50:51,688
Cause if I offer it to you,
this cookie might kill you

553
00:50:51,689 --> 00:50:58,863
- Don't think just because we was bouncing in the park...
- In order to understand, my dear

554
00:50:58,864 --> 00:51:06,931
It can be the sheets or the streets it don't
mean no never mind.  That's your bad, baby,
you can go or you can come.  Can you dig it?

555
00:52:15,531 --> 00:52:17,526
Black Dynamite,

556
00:52:18,747 --> 00:52:20,713
you scared me, baby.

557
00:52:23,383 --> 00:52:25,687
Why, baby?

558
00:52:25,688 --> 00:52:31,142
I am just a normal cat, who rights
the wrongs whenever he sees them.

559
00:52:31,143 --> 00:52:33,503
I know,

560
00:52:34,370 --> 00:52:38,738
you just cross the line sometimes, it's just,

561
00:52:38,739 --> 00:52:41,953
You just too much, baby.

562
00:52:41,954 --> 00:52:44,198
Well,

563
00:52:44,199 --> 00:52:47,825
you gotta cross the line sometimes.

564
00:52:47,826 --> 00:52:53,691
To do the right thing,
you gotta do the other thing.

565
00:52:55,365 --> 00:53:03,989
You know people... they don't want to see
the coward,  they want to see what scares them.
Can you dig it?

566
00:53:19,816 --> 00:53:21,261
Yeah...

567
00:53:21,262 --> 00:53:28,052
Black Dynamite, we got a breakthrough
and we need you...

568
00:53:28,053 --> 00:53:32,398
...a big shipment is coming to town

569
00:53:32,399 --> 00:53:36,558
Now "X" marks the spot to the warehouse, which will be done
Contraband

570
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:44,285
We don't know the when, but we do know the where.
Whatever it is, we'll be there when they appear.

571
00:53:46,989 --> 00:53:52,941
Looks like you got two warehouses,
one big one and one small one here.

572
00:53:52,942 --> 00:53:54,857
We break into two units,

573
00:53:54,858 --> 00:53:56,556
We hit the small one first,

574
00:53:56,557 --> 00:54:02,714
then we scale the fence, move south
using an acetylene blowtorch to hit
the warehouse in the back. 

575
00:54:02,715 --> 00:54:04,938
That way we avoid the guards.

576
00:54:04,939 --> 00:54:08,276
Then we hit the big warehouse
under the cover of darkness.

577
00:54:08,277 --> 00:54:15,938
- Now, the torches...
- Man, the honkies gonna be running for cover!
When us Brothers git 'em, git 'em...

578
00:54:20,361 --> 00:54:24,175
Now the torches needed, we ain't gonna
be able to get an acetylene torch in time.

579
00:54:24,176 --> 00:54:28,428
- Think again, Brother.
- You know someone who's got one?

580
00:54:28,429 --> 00:54:32,602
I know just the cat.

581
00:54:59,087 --> 00:55:02,008
Whoever is down there, kill them!

582
00:55:35,996 --> 00:55:38,449
Alright white face, where the drugs?

583
00:55:38,450 --> 00:55:41,437
Up yours, coon!

584
00:55:42,313 --> 00:55:46,047
It is right over there in the body bags, geez!

585
00:55:51,421 --> 00:55:53,902
How much dope is in the big warehouse?

586
00:55:54,584 --> 00:55:58,488
Bah, you're gonna kill me anyway,
I ain't gonna tell you nothing.

587
00:55:58,489 --> 00:56:00,368
Coon!

588
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:05,513
Dynamite, I got something
which will make him talk.

589
00:56:09,475 --> 00:56:12,638
I'll tell you nothing.

590
00:56:12,639 --> 00:56:21,857
Operation Code Kansas. Can't stop it.
Too late.  Operation Code Kansas
is gonna fix all the niggers.

591
00:56:21,858 --> 00:56:30,029
You won't be so big and so bad anymore.
Code Kansas is gonna fix you!

592
00:56:30,030 --> 00:56:35,524
Oh, yes, niggers!
Yes, yes, yes...

593
00:56:39,853 --> 00:56:44,186
Hey Smoke, I think you gave him
too much of that shit.

594
00:56:44,187 --> 00:56:47,393
How long 'til it wears off?

595
00:56:52,668 --> 00:56:56,268
Let's go hit the big warehouse.

596
00:57:13,895 --> 00:57:15,954
Malt liquor?

597
00:57:21,149 --> 00:57:27,081
That new Anaconda malt liquor
from the billboard, supposed
to give you "Oooooooo"

598
00:57:31,652 --> 00:57:33,749
Taste good, too.

599
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:38,321
I know the drugs here somewhere. 
We gonna check every crate 'til we find it.

600
00:57:44,219 --> 00:57:49,111
I can't believe it, that entire
shipment just for malt liquor.

601
00:57:49,112 --> 00:57:51,306
Don't know Dynamite,

602
00:57:51,307 --> 00:57:55,958
we still kept that fifty keys
we found in that first warehouse
from getting on the streets.

603
00:57:55,959 --> 00:58:02,871
I'm gonna go home and drink the rest
of this, man.  Y'all should grab
some of this shit.  It is incredible.

604
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:09,190
It don't make no damn sense.

605
00:58:09,191 --> 00:58:14,994
The shipments, the manifest, the shipping logs, the ledger.
All records are consistent with a big shipment.

606
00:58:14,995 --> 00:58:18,758
We have to missed something.

607
00:58:18,759 --> 00:58:21,128
Whatever it was they got it out before we got there.

608
00:58:21,129 --> 00:58:25,577
No... why would they still have
all those guards there, if they
got the drugs out?

609
00:58:25,578 --> 00:58:27,610
No, them crackers up to something.

610
00:58:27,611 --> 00:58:31,460
DB, we checked every single crate,
every stinkin' box!

611
00:58:31,461 --> 00:58:33,479
Man, I'm with you, Dynamite,

612
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:35,837
them be guarding something.

613
00:58:35,838 --> 00:58:39,610
What that guard said keep
running through my head,

614
00:58:39,611 --> 00:58:46,119
"Code Kansas", you people
won't be so big anymore. "Code Kansas"...

615
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:48,163
Don't make no damn sense.

616
00:58:48,164 --> 00:58:49,649
Hey hun...  What don't make no damn sense,

617
00:58:49,650 --> 00:58:55,038
is he service around this motherfucker.
Bitch, do you see us?

618
00:58:55,696 --> 00:59:00,166
I'd like two sausage pancakes, two hotdogs
split down the middle twice. Okay?

619
00:59:00,167 --> 00:59:06,684
Baloney, fried up in dough, slice that,
get a spatula smoosh it down.
And, a waffle.

620
00:59:06,685 --> 00:59:10,374
I can get you a waffle, but all we got
is the chicken from last night.

621
00:59:10,375 --> 00:59:12,916
Now I can bring you some of that,
if you want meat.

622
00:59:14,768 --> 00:59:18,775
- Chicken & waffles?
- That's it!!

623
00:59:19,964 --> 00:59:22,711
Take it easy Brother, it ain't her fault.

624
00:59:22,712 --> 00:59:29,453
Sorry, Sister, we all just a little uptight,
but if you bring us some of them
good ass waffles, everything will be alright.

625
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:35,095
Man, you ain't have no waffles like these,
these waffles so good they like the *,

626
00:59:35,096 --> 00:59:41,602
these buttery motherfuckers will
melt in your mouth, man.  These waffles...

627
00:59:42,369 --> 00:59:46,254
Wait, what did you just say...

628
00:59:46,255 --> 00:59:52,723
You said, "melt in your mouth".

629
00:59:53,446 --> 00:59:55,338
Quick!

630
00:59:55,339 --> 00:59:57,440
What else is melts in your mouth?

631
00:59:57,441 --> 00:59:58,441
M&Ms!

632
00:59:58,442 --> 01:00:00,570
Exactly!

633
01:00:00,571 --> 01:00:03,178
And, not just your hands.

634
01:00:07,166 --> 01:00:10,122
- Who makes M&Ms?
- White man.

635
01:00:10,123 --> 01:00:14,529
Yeah, yeah, Mars candy company
make them.  Yeah.

636
01:00:15,295 --> 01:00:20,410
- ...and Mars is also?
- The Roman god of war!

637
01:00:20,411 --> 01:00:21,620
- Right...

638
01:00:21,979 --> 01:00:24,661
Who is the Greek god of war?

639
01:00:24,662 --> 01:00:26,339
- Ares!
- You got it!

640
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:32,944
Now you take Mars, spell it
backwards, and drop the "s",

641
01:00:32,945 --> 01:00:38,767
Ram!  That's right, ram the
zodialogical sign for Ares.

642
01:00:40,110 --> 01:00:44,950
Oh, and get this.
Ares' half-sister is Athena.

643
01:00:46,066 --> 01:00:51,191
- Whoa, whoa.  Athena is...
- Which is the capital of Greece.

644
01:00:51,192 --> 01:00:55,795
As you all know, zodialogical astronomy
was created by the Greeks in...?

645
01:00:55,796 --> 01:00:58,139
[All at once:] 785 BC!

646
01:00:58,140 --> 01:01:02,118
785 is the area code for Topeka...
oh, my god!

647
01:01:02,119 --> 01:01:06,470
785 is the area code for Topeka, Kansas!

648
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:08,513
[Everyone:] "Code Kansas"!

649
01:01:08,867 --> 01:01:12,845
Now take that and spell it
backwards, and drop the "s".

650
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:17,728
Snack, Snake?  Snake!  Yeah.

651
01:01:17,729 --> 01:01:27,945
Yes, Brothers, and and who is the Greek
demi-god of medicine?  Who believed snakes'
tongue had mystical healing powers?

652
01:01:27,946 --> 01:01:29,812
Asclepius, of course.

653
01:01:29,813 --> 01:01:36,182
He had a staff with snakes intertwined
all around that bitch.  They called it Asclepius' staff.

654
01:01:36,182 --> 01:01:40,077
- It is a symbol the medical field uses to this day.
- I seen it.

655
01:01:40,078 --> 01:01:48,210
Now what legend, involving snakes,
is in both Greek and Roman mythology?

656
01:01:48,741 --> 01:01:53,327
- Come on.  It involves Asclepius' own father
- Apollo.

657
01:01:53,328 --> 01:01:56,162
- Yeah, thanks lady...
- That's right!

658
01:01:56,163 --> 01:02:03,351
Apollo slew the serpent at Delphi,
which was a big ass snake.

659
01:02:03,352 --> 01:02:10,530
- And, what Brothers, is the biggest snake in the world?
- It's the South American Anaconda.

660
01:02:10,531 --> 01:02:11,353
What she said.

661
01:02:11,902 --> 01:02:14,955
[Everyone:] Anaconda malt liquor!

662
01:02:14,956 --> 01:02:18,729
And, what is the slogan
for Anaconda malt liquor?

663
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:20,945
- Anaconda malt liquor gives you...
[Everyone:]  Ooooooooo

664
01:02:20,946 --> 01:02:23,274
Gives you what?!
[Everyone:]  Ooooooooo

665
01:02:23,275 --> 01:02:26,055
- And, who else is famous for...
[Everyone:]  Ooooooooo

666
01:02:26,056 --> 01:02:28,135
- [Everyone:]  Little Richard!
- Who?

667
01:02:28,136 --> 01:02:30,056
[Everyone:]  Little Richard!

668
01:02:30,057 --> 01:02:32,344
So, what they really saying is...

669
01:02:32,345 --> 01:02:38,493
[Everyone:]  Anaconda malt liquor gives you...

670
01:02:38,494 --> 01:02:42,472
What is another word for "Richard"?

671
01:02:44,554 --> 01:02:46,870
Damn, Smoke!

672
01:02:52,406 --> 01:02:58,483
Anaconda malt liquor gives you a little dick.

673
01:03:00,248 --> 01:03:02,598
Should we kill him?

674
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:07,352
Man, do you want to live?!

675
01:03:07,353 --> 01:03:11,103
I said, do you want to go on?

676
01:03:14,166 --> 01:03:18,675
Man, this time these crackers have gone too far!

677
01:03:19,951 --> 01:03:22,648
The warehouse!

678
01:03:28,174 --> 01:03:31,208
Freeze you jive time suckers!

679
01:03:31,209 --> 01:03:33,565
Who's in charge?

680
01:03:33,566 --> 01:03:40,635
Brothers, make these honkys put the dick
shrinking poison back into the warehouse
so we can burn this mutha down.

681
01:03:40,636 --> 01:03:42,453
Waste them, if they make a sound.

682
01:03:42,454 --> 01:03:45,553
I'm going to go inside, and
find out who is running this shit.

683
01:03:45,554 --> 01:03:48,500
- Come on, man
- Let back inside, Come on

684
01:03:49,354 --> 01:03:51,318
[Everyone shouting:]
- Alright man!   - Get going..

685
01:03:51,319 --> 01:03:52,545
O'Leary!

686
01:03:52,546 --> 01:03:53,757
That's right.

687
01:03:53,758 --> 01:03:56,507
Go on guys, I got this.

688
01:03:57,341 --> 01:04:00,965
O'Leary, you son of a bitch.
I should've known it was you.

689
01:04:00,966 --> 01:04:01,972
You should have.

690
01:04:01,973 --> 01:04:07,425
You were too busy trying to save your
precious ghetto, and trying to lay that orphan mama 
to see what was right in front of your face.

691
01:04:07,426 --> 01:04:10,155
You diabolical, dick shrinkin' motherfucker!

692
01:04:10,156 --> 01:04:14,128
You were behind it all the time, and
I'll bet you were behind Jimmy's death.

693
01:04:14,129 --> 01:04:16,211
Hey man, I was just following orders.

694
01:04:16,212 --> 01:04:19,357
That's what a good soldier does,
follow orders. Unlike you.

695
01:04:19,358 --> 01:04:20,957
Everything has to be done
the Black Dynamite way.

696
01:04:20,958 --> 01:04:24,808
I gave the order on Jimmy.  I gave it
to James who gave it to the Don.
What good is it going to do you?

697
01:04:24,809 --> 01:04:26,797
What would you do?

698
01:04:37,312 --> 01:04:43,594
I can't believe you did this trick from 'Nam.

699
01:04:45,299 --> 01:04:48,680
O'Leary? O'Leary, where are you?

700
01:04:48,681 --> 01:04:51,148
O'Leary's dead.  Who's this?

701
01:04:51,149 --> 01:04:54,650
*

702
01:04:54,651 --> 01:04:55,742
*

703
01:04:55,743 --> 01:04:57,943
*

704
01:04:57,944 --> 01:04:59,206
*

705
01:04:59,207 --> 01:05:03,334
*

706
01:05:03,335 --> 01:05:06,014
*

707
01:05:06,015 --> 01:05:07,864
*

708
01:05:07,865 --> 01:05:11,019
*

709
01:05:11,020 --> 01:05:12,802
*

710
01:05:15,110 --> 01:05:19,046
Fellas, we going on a boat ride...

711
01:05:19,047 --> 01:05:22,195
to Kung Fu island!

712
01:05:27,833 --> 01:05:31,418
Look Black Dynamite, there the island!

713
01:05:48,268 --> 01:05:52,996
Okay, here's the plan...

714
01:06:00,607 --> 01:06:03,243
Okay, let's split up.

715
01:06:23,358 --> 01:06:26,326
He's here...

716
01:06:28,912 --> 01:06:30,818
We did this!

717
01:06:30,819 --> 01:06:32,985
Power to you, Brothers!

718
01:06:33,941 --> 01:06:38,992
This is it, Brothers.  This is
where we stick it to The Man.

719
01:06:38,993 --> 01:06:41,896
Let's go get that lab.

720
01:06:43,033 --> 01:06:44,896
Alright, let's go.

721
01:06:46,469 --> 01:06:51,939
You know when we get back home, I'm gonna
retire from the revolution start a family,

722
01:06:51,940 --> 01:06:55,037
like my brother Joe.  Yeah, right on.

723
01:06:57,009 --> 01:07:02,492
Bullhorn said it gonna be a whole new country.
Do you know what I mean?

724
01:07:06,670 --> 01:07:10,140
Who saw where that came from?

725
01:07:10,140 --> 01:07:12,128
Let's go!

726
01:07:40,228 --> 01:07:44,543
I shoulda known you'd be
behind this, fiendish Dr. Wu

727
01:07:44,544 --> 01:07:52,240
Your knowledge of scientific biological
transmogrification is only outmatched
by your zest for Kung Fu treachery!

728
01:07:52,241 --> 01:07:59,102
Your Kung Fu is quite extra
ordinary, Black Dynamite.

729
01:07:59,103 --> 01:08:01,575
It's no match for mine.

730
01:08:02,152 --> 01:08:05,366
You should have joined us
when you had the chance.

731
01:08:05,367 --> 01:08:08,068
But, now you must die.

732
01:08:08,069 --> 01:08:11,296
Man, I'll take this jive ass turkey.

733
01:08:11,297 --> 01:08:12,811
Bullhorn, no!

734
01:08:18,409 --> 01:08:26,071
Bullhorn, no!  A friendship bonded
by the struggle against The Man has been
cut short by Kung Fu treachery!

735
01:08:26,072 --> 01:08:30,003
Brother, your death will not go unavenged.

736
01:08:30,004 --> 01:08:37,174
- Fiendish Dr. Wu, you fucked up now!
- Get him!

737
01:08:54,706 --> 01:09:00,800
You should try more familiar
with this brand of Kung Fu

738
01:09:10,054 --> 01:09:13,514
Black Dynamite Panther moves!

739
01:10:12,952 --> 01:10:15,106
What the fuck?

740
01:10:15,107 --> 01:10:18,574
Go get Black Dynamite!

741
01:10:26,751 --> 01:10:28,301
Looking for me?

742
01:10:33,267 --> 01:10:38,563
You can't see where I'm
coming from, you jive motherfucker!

743
01:10:40,295 --> 01:10:43,148
Come on, come on.

744
01:10:44,408 --> 01:10:47,585
You told him to keep an eye on me.

745
01:10:56,684 --> 01:11:00,032
Aha!  I threw that shit
before I walked in the room.

746
01:11:08,652 --> 01:11:11,305
There are two reasons you
still breathing, sucker.

747
01:11:11,306 --> 01:11:14,706
One, I want antidote to that dick shrinking drug.

748
01:11:14,707 --> 01:11:19,151
And, two, I want to know who's pulling
your strings.  Now start talking.

749
01:11:20,766 --> 01:11:22,901
No talk!

750
01:11:23,230 --> 01:11:25,595
I said, talk!

751
01:11:25,596 --> 01:11:29,407
The government... it's biological weapons,

752
01:11:29,408 --> 01:11:33,117
They put me in charge of male enhancements,

753
01:11:33,118 --> 01:11:38,532
your government has been preoccupied
with making a bigger penis for years.

754
01:11:42,491 --> 01:11:44,047
What's this green one?

755
01:11:44,048 --> 01:11:45,048
This is biggest disappointment.

756
01:11:46,558 --> 01:11:50,185
It did the exact opposite of what was intended.

757
01:11:50,987 --> 01:11:55,946
It made the penis shrivel to the size
of a two month old snapping turtle.

758
01:11:55,947 --> 01:12:00,096
That's what you been putting
in the malt liquor, huh?

759
01:12:02,723 --> 01:12:05,474
Just like the Tuskegee experiment.

760
01:12:05,475 --> 01:12:09,059
You trying to focus your anger
on the black man, didn't you?

761
01:12:09,060 --> 01:12:11,391
I was under orders,

762
01:12:11,392 --> 01:12:14,114
they threatened to fire me.

763
01:12:14,115 --> 01:12:15,966
Speaking of fire...

764
01:12:17,383 --> 01:12:22,086
Suddenly, I like to leave your island.

765
01:12:34,954 --> 01:12:37,401
You dirty motherfucker.

766
01:12:43,490 --> 01:12:46,187
Black Dynamite, I found me a helicopter.

767
01:12:46,188 --> 01:12:48,381
Quickly, give me a hair pin!

768
01:13:02,812 --> 01:13:07,155
We'll make sure this island never make
any more disk shrinking poison again.

769
01:13:07,156 --> 01:13:11,093
Right, let's light this bitch up!

770
01:13:17,852 --> 01:13:20,406
Take that, you dick shrinking island!

771
01:13:21,734 --> 01:13:25,618
Black Dynamite, how far does it go, man?

772
01:13:25,619 --> 01:13:32,575
Cream Corn, this goes all the way to the top. 
When I say top, I mean the tip-top.

773
01:13:50,610 --> 01:13:54,301
Here it is, Black Dynamite, the Honky House.

774
01:13:54,302 --> 01:13:57,171
I'm going down.

775
01:13:57,172 --> 01:13:58,564
This shouldn't take long.
Take the controls.

776
01:13:58,565 --> 01:14:00,602
How, Black Dynamite?  Wait...

777
01:14:05,585 --> 01:14:08,816
Son of a bitch!

778
01:14:10,132 --> 01:14:15,499
Cream Corn!  No!

779
01:14:22,347 --> 01:14:26,497
[ much shooting ]

780
01:16:17,091 --> 01:16:20,110
Should have know it was you all the time, sucker.

781
01:16:20,111 --> 01:16:25,725
Was not even the fiendish Dr. Wu
could come up with a plan so
diabolical all by himself.

782
01:16:25,726 --> 01:16:27,790
I had to ask myself,

783
01:16:27,791 --> 01:16:31,647
who is so frigid, so cruel,

784
01:16:31,648 --> 01:16:35,355
that he could serve smack to the orphans,
kill my brother Jimmy,

785
01:16:35,356 --> 01:16:39,589
and put out a drug that shrinks black men's dicks.

786
01:16:39,590 --> 01:16:43,574
Only one man, that's you Tricky Dick.

787
01:16:43,575 --> 01:16:47,792
So I'm here to deliver you
one Presidential ass-whupping.

788
01:16:47,793 --> 01:16:49,072
Black Dynamite.

789
01:16:50,265 --> 01:16:58,380
there's a perfectly logical explanation for that.

790
01:16:59,510 --> 01:17:02,430
Showtime, motherfucker!

791
01:17:39,808 --> 01:17:43,324
Don't mess with me, fucker!

792
01:18:19,690 --> 01:18:25,696
Take your filthy black hands off
the Presidential dinnerware, you moon cricket.

793
01:19:40,540 --> 01:19:44,691
And now, Black Dynamite, you must die.

794
01:19:57,294 --> 01:19:59,873
You had enough, Mr. President?

795
01:19:59,874 --> 01:20:02,779
You will never get away with this.

796
01:20:02,780 --> 01:20:08,815
Watch me, you little insecure cracker.
You think by shrinking our johnsons going
to make your situation any better?

797
01:20:08,816 --> 01:20:12,462
That's your problem, Tricky Dick, you are paranoid,

798
01:20:12,463 --> 01:20:17,995
it not that your Kung Fu skills are top-notch,
but its your weak mind that get you into trouble.

799
01:20:17,996 --> 01:20:22,503
Next thing you know two-bit crooks
will break Watergate.  For what?

800
01:20:22,504 --> 01:20:25,429
For these?

801
01:20:30,262 --> 01:20:33,116
Pictures!

802
01:20:33,117 --> 01:20:35,552
You've got them,

803
01:20:35,553 --> 01:20:38,967
but where? And, how?

804
01:20:38,968 --> 01:20:42,967
I had them a long time ago,
I was protecting my bitches.

805
01:20:42,968 --> 01:20:48,039
So, since you had me set-up,
I had my people watching you see
from cooks to janitors, baby.

806
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:52,250
You lost it all turkey.

807
01:20:52,251 --> 01:20:53,692
- Kill me.
- Say what?

808
01:20:53,693 --> 01:20:56,427
- Kill me!
- No...

809
01:20:56,428 --> 01:20:58,466
That's the easy way out for you,

810
01:20:58,467 --> 01:21:05,474
now unless you want the rest of these pictures
hitting the news, I suggest you take good care
of me and my people.  Can you dig it?

811
01:21:05,475 --> 01:21:09,411
- I said, can you dig it?
- Yes, yes, yes.

812
01:21:09,412 --> 01:21:12,786
I thought you did.

813
01:21:40,669 --> 01:21:45,355
First Lady, I'm sorry I pimp slapped
you into that china cabinet.

814
01:21:45,356 --> 01:21:47,283
I used excessive force.

815
01:21:47,284 --> 01:21:50,154
Often times I stay in the line,

816
01:21:50,155 --> 01:21:53,164
but I try to do so
in the name of what is right.

817
01:21:53,165 --> 01:21:56,095
Most of the time the ends justifies the means,

818
01:21:56,096 --> 01:21:57,511
but in this case,

819
01:21:57,512 --> 01:22:04,028
I feel like I betrayed my own code of ethics.
And, for that, sugar, I apologize.

820
01:22:04,029 --> 01:22:09,078
But, I shot at you.
I tried to kill you, Black Dynamite

821
01:22:09,079 --> 01:22:10,335
This is true,

822
01:22:10,336 --> 01:22:12,087
but you did not connect.

823
01:22:12,088 --> 01:22:18,398
You shot a plate.  Had you connected, maybe
pimp slapping you into that china cabinet
might have been justified.

824
01:22:18,399 --> 01:22:20,904
Bu, I feel I crossed the line.

825
01:22:20,905 --> 01:22:24,423
And for that, please accept my apologies.

826
01:22:24,424 --> 01:22:27,768
I do.  I do, it just...

827
01:22:27,769 --> 01:22:31,581
Black Dynamite, you're so righteous.

828
01:22:31,582 --> 01:22:33,544
This is also true.

829
01:22:33,545 --> 01:22:40,639
- Because wherever there is injustice...
- Oh, Black Dynamite!

830
01:22:42,571 --> 01:22:44,691
Go on.

831
01:22:44,692 --> 01:22:49,023
Wherever there is injustice,
wrongs to be right,

832
01:22:49,024 --> 01:22:51,051
innocents to be defended,

833
01:22:51,052 --> 01:22:54,997
Black Dynamite will be there
delivering an ass-whupping.

834
01:22:54,998 --> 01:22:59,717
I will not hesitate to eliminate
any clown who comes around,

835
01:22:59,718 --> 01:23:04,053
because if they want to the fight,
they better come see me

836
01:23:04,054 --> 01:23:09,253
because I am Black Dynamite!
