1
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,312
Time travel.

2
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,272
It'll turn your brain into
spaghetti if you let it.

3
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,276
Best not to think about it.

4
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,357
Best just to get on
with the job in hand,

5
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,755
which is destroying the enemy
before they're even born

6
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,950
and have a chance to threaten us.

7
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,673
We're expecting
any resistance to be light,

8
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,315
as the ancestors of our enemies
have yet to evolve any thumbs,

9
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,316
or indeed spines.

10
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,595
But that does not change the fact
that they may one day

11
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,598
evolve into a species that may
pose a threat to us.

12
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,235
And for that reason we are going
to rain down a fiery death upon them,

13
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,989
that will turn the surface of their
planet into a radioactive desert

14
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:14,238
because we are the Planetary Peace Corps
and that is what we do!

15
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:22,518
Now, are you nappy-wearing motherfuckers
ready to lock and load and get it on?!

16
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,879
What? No-no-no-no! Shh!

17
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,469
Look, it's not even a real gun! Ooh!

18
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,353
Ooh! Look at all the lights!

19
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,228
- <i>Liftoff.</i>
- Shut up!

20
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:10,309
<i> Due to technical difficulties,</i>
<i>the Star Ride is closed until further notice.</i>

21
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:18,035
<i>Due to technical difficulties,</i>
<i>the Star Ride is closed until further notice.</i>

22
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,276
Two for one at Dinoburger.

23
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,720
Two for one at Dinoburger.

24
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,320
It doesn't even make any sense.
Why would we do this?

25
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,271
Toby, don't start.

26
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,359
All right, love?
Two for one at Dinoburger.

27
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,756
We're encouraging people to eat dinosaurs,
to eat us, you know.

28
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,598
- Why would we do that?
- We're not real dinosaurs.

29
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:42,428
- We should be dressed as cavemen.
- Tobe, why do you always do this?

30
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,993
You were the same on the Ghost Train.

31
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:48,431
That wasn't logical, either.
Werewolves and vampires are natural enemies.

32
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,870
There is no way they would team up
to attack a train.

33
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,069
Stop thinking!

34
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,838
- Yeah...
- And talking!

35
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,591
Yeah, you're right actually.

36
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:01,349
We can't think much, cos a dinosaur's
brain is only the size of a walnut.

37
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,630
As far as talking goes,
it's just like...

38
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,519
Tobe, Tobe, Toby!

39
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,109
Stop it! You want to be careful
you don't get lost in the role.

40
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,435
I heard of this one guy
over on the Star Ride.

41
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,630
Actually thought he was a Space Ranger.

42
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,399
Traumatised a load of kids.
They sacked him.

43
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,910
Oh, hello, Ray.
Didn't see you there.

44
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,349
Pete. Tobe.

45
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,231
- It was a crappy job, anyway.
- Yeah.

46
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,475
- Loser.
- Says the man dressed as a dinosaur.

47
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,480
So, what are you gonna do?

48
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,478
I don't know.
I was thinking about maybe moving back home,

49
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,830
- taking that job at my uncle's place.
- Why do you wanna do that?

50
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,314
- We can get you another job here.
- Where?

51
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,112
Barry Burp's Bubble Ride?
Get you a job there easy.

52
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,675
- High turnover cos of the chlorine in the eyes.
- Hmm! It is tempting.

53
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,996
But there should be more to life
than dressing up as a bubble.

54
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,836
Maybe it's time to get real.

55
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,154
So...

56
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,596
In an ideal world,
what would be your perfect job?

57
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:15,155
- I don't know. Comic shop?
- Oh, come on. Think bigger.

58
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,350
Astronaut?

59
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,550
Yeah, cool!

60
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,720
But I mean your absolute dream job?
I mean, if there was... no limit.

61
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,239
No limits?

62
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,350
Well, it's obvious.

63
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,469
It's got to be Time Lord.

64
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,718
Oh, come to daddy! Ooh.
What's that?

65
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,116
- Four minutes, 32.
- That's bollocks. You led him on.

66
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,593
- What's this?
- It's a bet.

67
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,632
He reckons you'll mention time travel
in under five minutes.

68
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,511
You're making bets on me?

69
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,676
On the day I get fired,
you're making bets on me?

70
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,312
He did. I didn't want to.

71
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,918
I do talk about other things.

72
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,076
What? Like sky-fi?

73
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,718
How many times? It's not "sci-fi", Pete,
it's "science fiction",

74
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,036
or "SF",
which can also stand for "speculative fiction".

75
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,992
Jesus.
And you wonder why you can't get laid.

76
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,712
I can!

77
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,079
I do.

78
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,594
Some girls are into science fiction.

79
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:14,918
You see, that's your problem, Ray.
Your ideal girl is you.

80
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,393
With tits.

81
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,756
In fact, your ideal girl is him.

82
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,912
I object to that!

83
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,671
Now that was a shit film.
Someone should write and complain.

84
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,109
"Dear Hollywood, you're shit."

85
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,913
How hard can it be to make a film
that doesn't suck?

86
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,916
I've got millions of great ideas.

87
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,757
- Like what?
- What?

88
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,109
Come on,
I wanna hear one of your great ideas.

89
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,309
OK.

90
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,633
Right.

91
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,359
Prepare to be amazed.

92
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,709
Ninja Yodeller.

93
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,274
Are you just, like,
saying random words, Tobe?

94
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,357
No. Yodeller by day,
ninja by night, you see?

95
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,837
Oh, yeah, because the other way around
would be really stupid.

96
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,872
No, you've got like ninjas
who are really quiet, yeah?

97
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,230
Yodellers, really loud.
There's a conflict for the character.

98
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,191
Torn between two worlds.

99
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,674
He's really thought about this.

100
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:19,679
OK, you know the way sometimes
you come up with a really shit idea

101
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,439
like on purpose,
to try and test us out?

102
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,833
Yeah?

103
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,313
Is this one?

104
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,709
Yeah, you got me.

105
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,272
- Nearly had you, though.
- And him.

106
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,709
- Yeah.
- Ninja yodeller.

107
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,273
Ninja yodeller.

108
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,869
- How is your real script going?
- I'm doing most of the work up here.

109
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,196
Besides, every writer
needs to get out in the real world.

110
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,915
Have some experiences, fresh ones,
to enrich his work.

111
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:51,829
Really? I thought a writer
needed to stay in and write.

112
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,997
Yeah. That's the eternal
enigma of creativity.

113
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,315
We should discuss it.
In the pub.

114
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,554
- Give me that.
- Oi!

115
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,034
Oh, you thieving get!

116
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,799
- I said that!
- All great writers steal.

117
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,831
- Oh! Ray said that?
- What?

118
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,598
Give it to me. Give me my book.

119
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,039
Come on!

120
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,835
You'll see. One day I'll be famous
and then you'll be sorry.

121
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:24,432
"Dear Hollywood, please stop making
so many crappy movies.

122
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,233
"Here are a few tips to help you out.

123
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:31,592
"One: story is king.
Always has been, always will be."

124
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,791
- This is eating into our drinking time.
- OK.

125
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,308
Er, remakes, Jude Law...

126
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,512
"Han shot first.

127
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,315
"More Firefly and/or Serenity.
The end."

128
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,555
Well, that's Hollywood sorted.

129
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,034
Shall we move on
to the Middle East?

130
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,230
- Pen's running out.
- Oh, always the way.

131
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,555
- Nerds!
- Hey!

132
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,989
Didn't we all agree to stop
using the "N" word?

133
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,553
I didn't agree to anything.

134
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,909
"Nerd" is the word they use
to keep us down.

135
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:05,670
- You should use the term... "imagineer".
- Yeah.

136
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:11,431
That's the nerdiest thing I've ever heard!

137
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,072
You are just threatened.

138
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,953
You're threatened because
you don't understand our world.

139
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,195
What's to understand?
I saw one Star Trek film.

140
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,038
- I hated it, never looked back.
- Really? Which one?

141
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,629
The first one with the big,
gold robot and the little, fat mate.

142
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:30,870
- You mean Star Wars, don't you?
- Do I? Aren't they the same thing?

143
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,639
No. No, they're not.

144
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,275
- He knows.
- How would I know? I'm not a nerd.

145
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,595
Or even an imagineer.

146
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,234
- Better.
- I'm glad you're happy.

147
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,554
Whose round is it?

148
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,589
Mm-mm!

149
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,234
- I got the last round.
- I got the biscuits from the garage.

150
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,952
I paid for you to get into Scandals.

151
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,319
I paid for the cloakroom.

152
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,079
- I brought teabags round when you ran out.
- I lent you my coat.

153
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,156
The snug's less busy.

154
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,430
Can you get me some crisps?

155
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,959
Thanks.

156
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,550
He could wear stealth lederhosen.

157
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,750
- Jesus, you took your time!
- Yes, I did.

158
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,917
- I'll get the next round.
- Well done. I was impressed.

159
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,629
What?

160
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:22,719
It's a lot of effort to go to.
I mean, I'm er... I'm rather touched.

161
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,079
What are you talking about?

162
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:28,557
Cassie. Next door.
She fed me her little story.

163
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,034
- Cassie?
- The girl in the snug.

164
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,550
Come on, guys.
Fit, funny, dodgy American accent.

165
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,034
- You set it up.
- Just now?

166
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:41,198
Yeah. Look, whatever.
I just want to say thank you.

167
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,959
I think I might actually
be in with a chance there.

168
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,718
I see why you think it'd be a wind-up.

169
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,672
- You want to hear what happened or not?
- Absolutely.

170
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,358
Go on. Make her double-jointed.

171
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,119
Ignore him. Come on.
I want to hear it.

172
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,275
OK.

173
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,238
Hello, Ray.

174
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,316
Hi.

175
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,193
Erm... I'm sorry. Do I know you?

176
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,037
I'm Cassie.

177
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:12,277
You don't know me,
but I know you very well.

178
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,914
At least, I feel like I do.

179
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,592
I've read all about you.

180
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,470
- All about me?
- Yeah.

181
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:24,877
From your perspective,
those books haven't been written yet, but er...

182
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,435
Haven't been written yet,
like from the future?

183
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,708
Exactly!

184
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,949
Ah. Ah, I see.

185
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,673
- You're a time traveller.
- Bingo! Yes.

186
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,713
I didn't say I believed her.

187
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,320
- You've invented a girlfriend!
- I have not.

188
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,113
"Time-travelling hottie visits time-travel fan."

189
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,275
It's not a bad idea.

190
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:50,039
- How far back in time have you come?
- 150 years.

191
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,512
And where's your time machine?

192
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,834
Inside me.

193
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,952
Oh! That's handy, isn't it?

194
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,070
Is it like a little pill?

195
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,830
Uh, no, it's hard-wired into my bones which
have been replaced with a polymer composite.

196
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,519
So it's flexible,
but very standard issue.

197
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,509
Are you a space-lady?

198
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,595
Hello. Nanu.

199
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,596
- Phone home.
- No!

200
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,154
No, I repair time leaks.

201
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,714
- Sounds exciting.
- No.

202
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,830
No, it's not. Really.

203
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,438
It's quite dull.

204
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,597
- This is the only perk of the job.
- What is?

205
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,949
Meeting famous people from history.

206
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,869
Me?

207
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,832
I read that you would be in here
on this day, you know.

208
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,190
I just couldn't pass up a chance
of meeting Ray the Great.

209
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,799
It's what she said.

210
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,832
- "Ray the Great"!
- Shut up.

211
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:48,670
So, what other famous people,
like me, have you met?

212
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,518
Have you met Einstein or Elvis?

213
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,996
You know what you should do?
You should go back and kill Hitler.

214
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,270
- That's a classic.
- That's also a time crime.

215
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,596
- You're no fun.
- Yeah. We call it editing.

216
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,790
It's trying to erase
people from history.

217
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,796
- Like Hitler.
- Yeah, like Hitler.

218
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:08,833
But, a lot of the time,
it's more of a personal taste thing.

219
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,235
Like, Paris Hilton?

220
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,474
Who?

221
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,589
Brilliant.

222
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:17,394
Well, um, yeah,
they try to erase them from history

223
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,877
just because they don't like them or don't
like their songs or their films or whatever.

224
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,195
They are totally psychotic, Ray.

225
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,314
There's even one bunch of Editors who try to
kill artists immediately after their greatest works.

226
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,634
I don't get it.

227
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,148
Well, it's to avoid a decline in quality.

228
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,156
It would be like killing, say...

229
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,834
Kevin Costner right after
Dances With Wolves.

230
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,189
- You could do Morrissey.
- After The Smiths?

231
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,673
No. Just generally.

232
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,877
- George Lucas after Jedi?
- Ooh! Empire, surely.

233
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,911
Mm-mm. You'd miss the Ewok battle.

234
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,678
Who cares?

235
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,948
I care.

236
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,514
Let's see how good
your research really is.

237
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,917
What is... the grandfather paradox?

238
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,110
I...

239
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:05,199
I've got to be honest with you, Ray,
I didn't exactly finish the manual.

240
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,869
It was like a brick.
I'm more of a quick-start pamphlet kinda girl.

241
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:12,310
Yes. Sure.
I mean, who's got the time, you know?

242
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:16,194
- It's only history we're messing with.
- I'm not totally stupid.

243
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:21,268
I can safely talk to you because everyone
knows you're obsessed with time travel.

244
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,514
So?

245
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,518
So, no one will believe you
when you tell them about this.

246
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,357
Very clever, Ray.

247
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,392
- Double bluff. I like it.
- Still don't believe you.

248
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,637
What about Chaos Theory?
You do know about Chaos Theory?

249
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,955
Oh! Yes, of course.

250
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,996
Chaos Theory is the idea
that all actions have consequences...

251
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,357
when you take that... quantum leap...

252
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,436
OK, erm, bit of advice.

253
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,031
When you are talking about this stuff,
speak with a bit more confidence about it.

254
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,991
OK, well, I will.

255
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,076
I'll bear that in mind, thank you.

256
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,317
Chaos Theory is the idea that
tiny things can have huge consequences.

257
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,112
Because you delayed
me going through,

258
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,391
all the things I was going to do
have been delayed subsequently.

259
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,398
That has a knock-on effect,
which can totally change the future.

260
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:12,035
So, so wait, that means you're
going to drink your pint a bit later

261
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,629
which means you're going to go
to the bathroom a little bit later.

262
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,071
My God, Ray, you're right.
That's terrible, we're all doomed!

263
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,156
Do you have any idea how rare it is
to find a girl who's into science fiction

264
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,997
who doesn't have everything pierced?

265
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,270
How do you know I haven't?

266
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,078
Um, listen,
you should come through. Join us.

267
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,350
I'll tell the guys what a good job you did.

268
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,277
Have they paid you yet?
I could get you a tip.

269
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,995
Not in a stripper kind of way
because you're not a stripper, obviously.

270
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,157
But you'd make a fine one.
I'm sure you'd look great in a...

271
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,791
Well put.

272
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:55,958
No. Thank you. I have to go actually.

273
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,594
Oh, no. What's the rush?

274
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,710
I've got a time leak to find,
remember?

275
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,239
Of course.

276
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:08,475
OK. Er, well...
I'll see you later, then.

277
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,353
Hey, in the future maybe.

278
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,277
Yeah, maybe.

279
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,709
Could you? I'm sorry.

280
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,349
Thanks.

281
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,279
Bye, Ray.

282
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,753
Bye.

283
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,758
Not bad. Not bad at all.

284
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,634
Can't really say I'm buying
the time-travelling skeleton thing.

285
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,238
A bit too Terminator.

286
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,510
No, but I like the sexy time traveller.

287
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,677
- How does it end?
- I don't know because I'm not making it up.

288
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,632
- She was real.
- I know what it is.

289
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:45,355
You know how you can pay a prostitute
to act things out for you?

290
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,469
No, I don't.

291
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,830
Someone who knows Ray well
treated him to a time-travelling hooker!

292
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,313
She was nice!

293
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,432
You didn't even sleep with her.
That was probably in with the price.

294
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,313
- She wasn't a prostitute.
- You should have slept with her.

295
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,759
- You know why?
- Why?

296
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,951
Cos she'd have shagged you
into the middle of next week.

297
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,558
Eh? Eh? Come on. Come on.

298
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,589
Thank you. Thank you.

299
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,517
My name's Pete
and I'll be here all week.

300
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,154
Down those and we'll catch
last orders at The King's Head.

301
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,111
I'm going to take a leak.

302
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,549
- Oh! Because of the future thing? Ah.
- Mm.

303
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,637
¶ <i>Every now and then I fall apart</i>

304
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,956
¶ And I need you now, tonight

305
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,675
¶ And I need you more than ever

306
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,518
¶ And if you'll only hold me tight

307
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,916
¶ We'll be holding on forever

308
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,555
¶ And we'll only be making it right

¶ Cos we'll never be wrong

310

¶ Together we can take it
to the end of the line

311
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:51,038
¶ Your love is like a shadow on me
all of the time

312
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,914
¶ I don't know what to do
I'm always in the dark

313
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,873
¶ We're living in a powder keg
and giving off sparks

314
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,878
¶ I really need you tonight

315
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,434
¶ Forever's gonna start tonight

316
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,273
¶ Forever's gonna start tonight

317
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:12,630
¶ Once upon a time I was falling in love

318
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,558
¶ Now I'm only falling apart

319
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,915
¶ There's nothing I can say

320
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,918
¶ A total eclipse of the heart

321
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,269
¶ Now I'm only falling apart

322
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,197
¶ There's nothing I can say

323
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,118
¶ A total eclipse of the heart ¶

324
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,359
Oh, my God.

325
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,513
It's me.

326
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,353
¶ <i>... total eclipse of the heart</i>

327
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:36,079
¶ <i>A total eclipse of the heart</i> ¶

328
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,996
- Are we off, then?
- Oh, shit!

329
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:45,555
I will see your time-travelling hottie
and raise you a pub full of bodies.

330
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,431
Is that piss on your jeans?

331
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,273
No. Not all of it.

332
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,759
Bollocks.

333
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,075
Couldn't this be the leak
your woman was looking for?

334
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,998
- So you believe me now, do you?
- I still don't, for the record.

335
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,429
After what I've just seen,
I'll believe anything.

336
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,516
Guys, I just saw my own dead face.

337
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,198
Whoo-ooh-ooh!

338
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,150
Go in yourself. You'll see.

339
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,476
I don't know. I mean...
First a future woman, and now this.

340
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,149
It's, it's like a
time-travel murder mystery.

341
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,236
- You guys...
- It's not me!

342
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,628
- Are you winding us up?
- No.

343
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,911
Look, something very bad
is gonna happen.

344
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,190
I've just had a premonition
of my own death.

345
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,358
Then why don't you just leave? If you're
so spooked, why don't you just run away?

346
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,594
- Go home?
- Right.

347
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:37,633
Because it's not tonight. The other me,
the dead me, he had a beard.

348
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,956
Oh, I see. Little beard.

349
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,753
A tenner says something happens
when you go in.

350
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:47,031
Another bet? What trick have you
got up your sleeve, Petey?

351
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,718
This is great.

352
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,113
Come on. Let's all go.

353
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,276
No chance. I'm staying right here.

354
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,912
Well, get my money ready.

355
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,040
- Come on.
- Are we going to go in? Brilliant!

356
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:12,269
- Are those two dead?
- What? What do you mean?

357
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,315
Are those two dead?

358
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,873
Oh. No, not yet.

359
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,799
- Whaa!
- Bollocks!

360
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,119
Pack it in!

361
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:31,159
- Hello, Petey. Change your mind?
- No. Just going to watch from here.

362
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,237
Eurgh! It certainly smells
like someone died.

363
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,635
Shit-shit-shit!
What the fuck are you doing?

364
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,591
If you've got anything planned,
you'll get it.

365
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,029
I haven't got anything planned.
Will you let me out?

366
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,069
Nope.

367
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,236
Oh, shit. I'm in again. Oh, shit.

368
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,999
- Ray, check the loos.
- What?

369
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,793
He's probably got some bloke
in a Scream mask.

370
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,911
Or something even more brilliant.

371
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,392
Ooh! It really does stink in here.

372
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:02,956
- You might as well just pay me now.
- Oh, it's like a dung-ey, zoo-ey kind of...

373
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,197
- It's Pete's bullshit you can smell.
- Listen!

374
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,231
This isn't a wind-up.

375
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,071
Do you really want to see the future?

376
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,519
I'd love to.

377
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,671
OK. You've got to do exactly
what I did.

378
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,039
What do you mean?

379
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,588
¶ If you'll only hold me tight

380
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,949
¶ We'll be holding on forever...

381
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,319
I can't believe I'm doing this.

382
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,920
I feel like I'm doing the conga
at a really shit party.

383
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,154
¶ Cos we'll never be wrong...

384
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,760
- Is this really necessary?
- I don't know, it might be.

385
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,951
- Don't look. I can't do it.
- I wasn't looking.

386
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,470
¶ Together we can make it
to the end of the line

387
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,149
¶ Your love is like a shadow on me
all of the time...

388
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,189
Right, hold on.

389
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,152
For what? There must be
easier ways of making money.

390
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,637
- It's a science experiment.
- Mm-hm.

391
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,393
Now, hold on tight for this bit.

392
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:00,319
¶ I don't know what to do
I'm always in the dark

393
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:03,591
¶ We're living in a powder keg
and giving off sparks...

394
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:07,474
Here's an idea. Instead of a time machine
that runs on karaoke and urine,

395
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,592
maybe they could have one with a dial,
with dates on it.

396
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,551
Something crazy like that.

397
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,750
¶ I really need you tonight...

398
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,949
Oh, God!

399
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,230
¶ Forever's gonna start tonight...

400
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,718
¶ Once upon a time
I was falling in love

401
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,478
¶ Now I'm only falling apart...

402
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,592
Pete, do you really do this
every time you take a piss?

403
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,029
- Tenner says something happens.
- Yeah!

404
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:35,119
But it's gotta be something definite,
like, say, a pub full of dead people.

405
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,958
Not just some bollocks weirdy feeling.

406
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,353
OK.

407
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,351
¶ Nothing I can say

408
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:47,359
¶ A total eclipse... of the heart ¶

409
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,871
- What's that I can hear?
- Ssshh. Wait.

410
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,753
Oh, come on.
What are they, the talking dead?

411
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:15,639
Oh, my God!
Everyone's still alive.

412
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:22,792
I don't know what happened out there,
but I feel dirty.

413
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,115
I'm going to get some peanuts now.

414
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,991
- Pay up.
- Didn't shake hands.

415
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:30,794
- What are you, 12?
- Look, I swear to you, I saw myself right here.

416
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,717
Story is king.

417
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,876
Always has been, always will be.

418
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,639
This is eating into
our drinking time.

419
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,515
Oh! Hey.

420
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,916
- Someone's got our seats, Ray.
- Have they? Our stuff's over there.

421
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,394
- They looked familiar, didn't they?
- Just a bit.

422
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,192
There's spare seats in the snug.

423
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,754
- That's not really the problem.
- What is the problem?

424
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,791
I think you'd better go
and have a look.

425
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,595
Shall we move on
to the Middle East?

426
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,039
Pen's running out.

427
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,308
Always the way.

428
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,237
- Nerds!
- Hey!

429
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:08,192
Didn't we all agree
to stop using the "N" word?

430
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,549
I didn't agree...

431
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,273
"Nerd" is the word
they use to keep us down.

432
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:17,154
You should use
the term "imagineer".

433
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,673
Shall we get the fuck out of here?

434
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,434
- So, what do we do now, Ray?
- What?

435
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,948
- This is your thing.
- This is not my thing.

436
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,390
My thing is reading books about this shit,
not actually being in it.

437
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:35,352
What about the rules?
There's always rules, isn't there?

438
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,710
- Yeah, but it depends who you read.
- Well, even I know some rules.

439
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,957
- Like what?
- You can't tread on any butterflies.

440
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,231
Not just butterflies,
you can't kill anything in the past,

441
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:51,957
because it wipes out all its descendants and you
could end up wiping out the whole human race.

442
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,912
Don't sleep with anyone.
It ends up being your mum or gran.

443
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,791
- That's just sick!
- It's still tonight.

444
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,193
We haven't gone back to The Blitz.

445
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,313
- You asked for rules, I'm giving you rules.
- Don't kill anything, don't fuck anything.

446
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,476
- What else?
- Don't touch yourself.

447
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,397
My mind is on other things right now.

448
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,908
No. I mean, don't touch the other us.

449
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,077
We can't bump into
or speak to the earlier us.

450
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,998
Why? Couldn't we just warn them
not to go into the bog?

451
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,679
No, we can't,
because that would cause a paradox.

452
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,915
- A what?
- If they don't go into the bogs,

453
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:24,078
they don't go back in time, and if that
doesn't happen then we cease to exist.

454
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,588
It's a variant on the grandfather paradox.

455
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,278
Fucking hate sci-fi.

456
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,548
Science fiction.

457
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,636
So, do we go back in the toilets?

458
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,750
No! That could take us anywhere.

459
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,598
But last time it took him back
to where he started, didn't it?

460
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,473
Yeah, but it also took me
to a room full of dead bodies.

461
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:44,036
- He's right, it's not predictable.
- Where does that leave us, Ray?

462
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,911
I think I've got an idea.

463
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,189
Hiding in a cupboard?
Yeah.

464
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,198
That's going to stop me being dead?
It's simple.

465
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:56,869
We wait for the earlier us to go into the loos
and disappear into the past.

466
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:00,833
How long d'you think that's gonna be?
About another half an hour.

467
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,758
Oh, you're joking.
My neck is killing me already.

468
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,360
Ow, ow. Hot!

469
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,915
Bugger. Ow!
Can I sit down?

470
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,678
I don't know. Can you?

471
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:13,989
Oh!

472
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,110
No pulling!

473
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,112
Oh, I think I found a light.

474
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,114
- Maybe leave the light off.
- Yeah.

475
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,832
Anyone want a peanut?

476
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,359
No.

477
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:50,717
I really thought time travel
would be a bit more thrilling than this.

478
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,830
Mm. I know what you mean.

479
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,838
Oh! Oh, no, wait a minute.

480
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,314
- Oh, my God!
- What?

481
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:03,033
We're half an hour in the past.
She's still here.

482
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,834
Oh!

483
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,395
Have they paid you yet?
I could get you a tip.

484
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,672
Not in a stripper kind of way
because obviously you're not a stripper.

485
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:17,030
But you'd make a fine one.
I'm sure you'd look great in a...

486
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,792
Wait a minute.

487
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,953
What's this?

488
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,514
I can-I can feel a
fir tree through here!

489
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,437
There's...

490
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:32,838
There's a whole other world back here
with-with snow and thorns and talking lions.

491
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,552
Is there?

492
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,589
No!

493
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,794
Dick.

494
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,752
I love Narnia.

495
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,073
Bye, Ray.

496
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,235
Cassie! Cassie!

497
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:55,238
Ray, I really have to go.

498
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,748
Oh, no, no, no! You think I'm him?

499
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,360
I'm not him.
I mean, obviously, I am.

500
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:04,359
We really need your help. First of all,
I now believe you are a time traveller.

501
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:09,758
Sorry about doubting you there and sorry
about the whole stripper, space-woman thing.

502
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,994
OK.

503
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,679
And second of all,
I think we found your time leak.

504
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,914
It's in the gents.

505
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,880
Oh, oh, very good. Very good.

506
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,195
- So the leak is...
- In a toilet.

507
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:26,550
Yes, yes! It seems the universe
has a sense of humour.

508
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,398
And it's very funny and quick too.

509
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,998
You don't believe me.

510
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,189
Touché.

511
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,229
Oh, no. No, no!

512
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:36,989
This is for real, OK?
Pete saw dead bodies in the pub.

513
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:42,068
OK, well, I've got to go climb back
into my spaceship and disappear.

514
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:45,317
Look, why else would I have two men
in this cupboard?

515
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,193
I'll see you around,
future boy.

516
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,555
Wait, Cassie! Cassie!

517
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,998
I think it's time we had
another little chat, Ray.

518
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,718
- So you're sure we're OK out here?
- Yes, we're fine.

519
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:05,399
No one's due out in the garden
for another 23 minutes.

520
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,749
- OK. Good.
- Huh.

521
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,872
This is a bit of a new look for you.

522
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,672
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

523
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:19,395
I mean, you know, it's very nice.
Very quick too.

524
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,795
Well, not from my point of view.

525
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,832
It actually took quite a bit of time
to sort all this out.

526
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,950
- Oh, yeah? How long?
- Six months.

527
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:32,238
So, you just went through the door,
went into the future for six months

528
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:35,750
- and then came back out...
- One second after I left you.

529
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,392
Wow!

530
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,873
Oh, thank you.

531
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,434
So, it's erm...

532
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:47,359
It's all sorted, then,
with the time leak and dead bodies?

533
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,118
Yep. All sorted.

534
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,149
Are you sure?

535
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:56,079
Ray, I didn't spend the last
six months just dyeing my hair.

536
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,599
I'm a professional.

537
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,471
Hmm.

538
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,198
So, what was all this about, then?

539
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,117
I'm sorry, I can't tell you.

540
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,229
What. Why not?

541
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:08,511
That knowledge is anachronous
to your time period.

542
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,358
That sounded like you really knew
what you were talking about.

543
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,391
I know. I know!

544
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,714
It's great, isn't it?

545
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:18,719
I did what you told me and started saying
everything with confidence

546
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,113
even if I don't have a clue.

547
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:25,319
It's just had an amazing effect.
I even got a promotion.

548
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,759
Really?

549
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,069
You got a promotion?

550
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,832
Well, I got off probation.

551
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,754
Mmm. That's pretty much the same.

552
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,028
Yeah.

553
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:43,958
And what did you reckon
to me avoiding that paradox in there?

554
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:49,554
- Ray, you hid in a cupboard.
- I thought I did well under the circumstances.

555
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,512
I mean, sure,
I don't have a manual to ignore.

556
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,596
Will you stop it with the manual?

557
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,035
So, how do we get back
to the right time?

558
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,595
Well, er, we're nearly there, anyway.

559
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,471
- So we just wait?
- Yeah.

560
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,272
In the cupboard?

561
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,231
I'm afraid so.

562
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,872
No glowing portal?

563
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:18,235
No vortex? No big star ship?

564
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,475
Just sit and wait in the cupboard?

565
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,555
Yeah.

566
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:27,596
Not exactly the glamour that
I had expected from time travel.

567
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,232
I did warn you.

568
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:34,478
Any chance I could wait
out here with you?

569
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,794
Why?

570
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,229
Just, erm, because...

571
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:44,156
It's better than wedging myself
in a cupboard with two very sweaty men.

572
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:47,829
- Not a good thing.
- No. No, I imagine not.

573
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,916
So, we'll just hang out
here for a while.

574
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,793
Yeah. That would be nice.

575
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,155
I thought you said
we had 20 minutes.

576
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,553
Yeah.

577
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:04,639
Oh, it's... not a problem.

578
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:11,595
Uh, I'm just going to go check that out and
maybe you should get back in that cupboard.

579
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:16,475
- But everything's going to be OK?
- Ray, relax. I told you, I'm a professional.

580
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:27,478
Well, they do say that things
taste better outside.

581
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,591
Thank God.

582
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,471
Things taste better outside.

583
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,791
Twat.

584
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,111
- Hang on.
- Pack it in.

585
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,513
This is it.

586
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,516
Hello, Petey. Change your mind?

587
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,516
No. Just gonna watch from here.

588
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:51,109
Shit-shit-shit!
What the fuck are you doing?

589
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,276
- Where are you going?
- I need a piss.

590
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,595
- You can't go in there!
- You said your woman fixed it.

591
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,837
I'm sure she has,
but the other us might still be in there.

592
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,271
Oh, my... Just go to the ladies.

593
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,953
Ladies?

594
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,708
I'm confused.

595
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,911
You're pissing in the ladies,
of course you're confused.

596
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,555
So, the other versions of us
have gone back in time and become us.

597
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,512
Oh, you see?
You say that like it makes sense.

598
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,630
To me it's just crazy talk.

599
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,830
I quite like it in the ladies.

600
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,711
I'm so confused.

601
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,910
Look, Pete,
don't worry about it.

602
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,793
All you need to know is that
we're back in the right time

603
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,558
and everything is going to be OK.

604
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,717
Did you get that girl's number, Ray?

605
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,239
Oh, shit.

606
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,113
- You said she had fixed it.
- She said she had.

607
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:01,277
Maybe she didn't expect us
to go into the ladies.

608
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,709
And we didn't do that conga thing.

609
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,751
Yeah, maybe that wasn't vital.

610
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,477
- Oh, fuck this, lads.
- No, Pete, wait! Oh!

611
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:13,193
- Maybe he's got the right idea.
- Yeah, maybe.

612
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,037
Don't go in!

613
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:19,629
Oh! Oh, thank God!

614
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,752
It's so good to see you again,
at last!

615
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,031
- What the hell happened to you?
- I don't want to talk about it.

616
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,996
Let's never speak of this again.

617
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,109
Er, Pete...

618
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,357
- Have you got shit on you?
- Yeah!

619
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,630
They won't attack you
if you wear their scent.

620
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,797
- Who won't?
- I don't want to talk about it.

621
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,593
Ray, what shall we do now?

622
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,589
Don't know.

623
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,551
- Shall we go back into the toilets?
- Yeah.

624
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,874
No!

625
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,273
It's not safe.

626
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,788
We need weapons and food.

627
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,359
What the hell did happen to you?

628
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,277
I really don't want to talk about it.

629
00:37:55,320 --> 00:38:00,633
All I will say is that weapons and food
would be a really good idea.

630
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:06,596
Oh! Maybe we'll have a look around
for weapons and food first.

631
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,358
Yeah. Sounds like a plan.

632
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,552
What do you think happened?

633
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:41,715
- You're a little bit excited, aren't you?
- A little bit.

634
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,957
Come on, it's the... It's the future.

635
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,831
I've always wanted to go there.

636
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,074
Not alone any more.

637
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:50,680
No more running. No more hiding.
No more bad dreams.

638
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:54,190
You know, for someone
who really doesn't want to talk about it,

639
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,958
he can be quite chatty, can't he?

640
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,798
Weapons and food.
That's what we need.

641
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,159
Crisp, anyone?

642
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,195
Have you checked
the sell-by date on those?

643
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,394
May...

644
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,710
...2094.

645
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,193
How do they taste?

646
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,795
Off.

647
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,750
So, whose round is it?

648
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,716
- Ah...
- Er...

649
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,034
Guys...

650
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,719
- I think I've seen us.
- What?

651
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:14,036
One time I bumped into three guys
who were dressed like this.

652
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,713
Like we are now.

653
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:19,399
Only I didn't recognise us.

654
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,715
Us? In the future?

655
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,558
- Must have been.
- But we've only just put these on.

656
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,875
It's time travel.
Shit like that happens.

657
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,113
Did we look well?

658
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,879
Yeah, I suppose so.

659
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:35,593
Too busy running in the
other direction to notice.

660
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:41,194
Come on.
Let's get back to the toilets.

661
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:44,550
Whoa, whoa! What?
But we've only just got here.

662
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,149
I think we've all got the idea,
haven't we?

663
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,394
The future is broken.

664
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:53,228
We have to have a little look around.
I mean, how can we not?

665
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,633
Are you serious?

666
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:58,434
- Have you actually looked out there?
- This might just be a bad area.

667
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:02,075
In a bad area, windows get put through,
kids drink on corners.

668
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,680
That is the end of the fucking world!

669
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,234
Ray, don't you want to go home?

670
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:11,319
Of course I do.
Just, you know, in a little while.

671
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:16,434
The way home isn't out there,
it's in there, and I want to go home.

672
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,758
I really do, and every time I go in and come out,
I pray I'll be in the right time.

673
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,234
One day I will be.

674
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,794
Pete, exactly how long
have you been doing this?

675
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,832
Long enough to know
it's better to hunt in packs.

676
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:32,713
- That doesn't sound good.
- So they can't attack from behind.

677
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,159
Or that.

678
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,829
Let's just sit down,
all right, in the warm

679
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:41,953
and-and-and wait for rescue, OK?

680
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,275
Rescue? No one knows we're here.

681
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:47,357
At least out there
there might be someone who can help us.

682
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,709
- Like who?
- I don't know. Like...

683
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,479
Oh, like friendly future people
with huge heads.

684
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:55,080
You're living in a dream world,
both of you.

685
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,311
I'm going to go
and get a bit of wood.

686
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,759
Thanks, Pete.

687
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,837
Not for the fire.
I'm going to turn this into a spear.

688
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,350
And when I get back, you two,
you'd better be ready to go,

689
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,755
because I'm not going alone again.

690
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,953
What's up with you?

691
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:14,669
What?

692
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:17,553
How many times have we talked
about seeing the future, Tobe?

693
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,033
I'm not going out there.

694
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,674
Those look like the sort of streets
monsters run down.

695
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:25,315
Besides, I haven't really got
the right shoes on for the rubble.

696
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,797
There's always something,
isn't there?

697
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:32,276
"Oh, I couldn't send my script out,
the margins were too wide."

698
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:35,915
"I couldn't go to that job interview,
there was a spot on my elbow."

699
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:38,838
"I can't go exploring,
it's the end of the world."

700
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,632
That last one is quite a good one.

701
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:45,435
No, it's fine. You just...
You just wait there.

702
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,675
For rescue.

703
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,750
And you call yourself an imagineer.

704
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,594
Ray?

705
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,839
Ray!

706
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,472
Toby!

707
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,799
Pete!

708
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:51,070
What's going on? Are you OK?

709
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:58,032
Is everything all right out here?

710
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,593
Oh, my God.

711
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:18,116
What does it mean, Ray?
What does it mean?

712
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,230
- It's us.
- Do you think?

713
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,630
Your woman said you'd get famous, right?

714
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,153
Well, maybe we all do.

715
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:32,952
- What for?
- I don't know.

716
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,151
Maybe we form a band.

717
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,032
Can anybody play anything?

718
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:42,994
Maybe we learn.

719
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,429
And maybe it's not a band.

720
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:51,273
Do you think they did it from photos
or do you think we posed?

721
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:54,357
- We're dressed as we are now.
- Yeah, that's a headfuck.

722
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:57,669
Whoa!

723
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:01,437
- What was that?
- What was what?

724
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:02,674
A noise.

725
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,472
There is no noise.

726
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:05,999
Pete?

727
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,430
Shit. What the fuck was that?

728
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,032
- Sounded like mandibles.
- What?!

729
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:15,548
- It's what insects eat with.
- I know what mandibles are!

730
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:16,794
Big insects.

731
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,910
There was another sound,
like a moaning sound.

732
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,350
Big, moaning insects.
Back to the toilets!

733
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,436
No, wait.
We don't know that for sure.

734
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:29,952
- It needn't be insects. It could be... anything.
- Right. It could be my big friendly future people.

735
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,276
You know,
with their spindly bodies and their huge hands.

736
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:03,309
- I think we got a little bit spooked over nothing.
- Shh! Things can come in here as well.

737
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,237
- What kind of things?
- Sshh.

738
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,840
No, no! I will not sshhh!
You are freaking me out.

739
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:10,678
- Toby, leave him alone.
- No, no, Ray. Look at him.

740
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:15,077
He's covered in shit and scared shitless. Don't
you think it'd be handy to know what did that?

741
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:17,953
Aren't you just a little curious
about how come he's...

742
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,319
Sshh!

743
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:25,548
One time I came in here
and went out through that door.

744
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:26,953
And I fell...

745
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:31,992
It must have been when ground level
was different, 40 feet different.

746
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:35,635
I landed in a wood.
I couldn't tell you what time I was in.

747
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:39,832
If it was the past, our fossil records
are pretty fuckin' far from complete.

748
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:42,112
But I wasn't the first to fall.

749
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:45,869
- You met other people?
- I didn't say they were alive.

750
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:52,192
There was things in that wood
that only came out at night.

751
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,753
The breathing.

752
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,518
The noises.

753
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:59,118
The screams.

754
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:02,113
Pack it in!

755
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:04,868
Change your mind?

756
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:07,718
Shit-shit-shit!
What the fuck are you doing?

757
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,877
If you have anything planned,
you're going to get it too.

758
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:12,239
It's us!

759
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:14,840
I haven't got anything planned.

760
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:18,270
- We can warn ourselves.
- If we do, then we cease to exist.

761
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:19,753
Exactly.

762
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:29,357
Ray, check the loos.

763
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,630
He's probably got some bloke
in a Scream mask.

764
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:34,478
Not a fucking sound.

765
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:37,512
Oh. Really does stink in here.

766
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:39,551
You might as well
just pay me now.

767
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:44,276
It's like a dung-ey, zoo-ey...

768
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,675
- It's Pete's bullshit you can smell.
- Listen!

769
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:49,359
This isn't a wind-up.

770
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:53,996
- Do you really want to see the future?
- I'd love to.

771
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:56,190
You've got to do exactly what I did.

772
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,798
What do you mean?

773
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:00,718
¶... I can say

774
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:04,833
¶ A total eclipse... of the heart

775
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:16,475
They've gone.

776
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:21,032
Oh, that's just great!
That's just fucking great!

777
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:23,514
I could have saved myself. Saved us!

778
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:27,792
- Pete, we'll cease to exist!
- Yeah, well, I don't care!

779
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:30,752
If I get the chance to warn myself again,
I'm going to do it.

780
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,836
To hell with anyone
who tries to stop me.

781
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,233
Oh, shit!

782
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:38,478
- I was wondering when that would happen.
- Wait!

783
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:40,238
Pete, no!

784
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:49,229
What is this?

785
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:52,590
OK, Ray. Keep it together. What would
Miss Marple do? What would Miss Marple do?

786
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:56,110
There's hundreds of us.
How can there be hundreds of us?

787
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:59,311
Did Pete touch himself? Is this what
happens when you do a big paradox?

788
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:02,397
They aren't us, Tobe.
They're only dressed like us.

789
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:05,716
Ah, well, that's all right, then.
Now it makes complete sense.

790
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:10,151
OK, what we need to do now
is find Pete and get the hell out of here.

791
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:25,750
¶ <i>Run for the sun, little one</i>

792
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:28,189
¶ <i>You're an outlaw once again</i>

793
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:34,349
¶ <i>Time to change,</i>
<i>Superman will be with us while he can</i>

794
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:39,439
¶ <i>In the land of make believe...</i>

795
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:49,757
Tobe? I think I know why everyone
is dressed like us.

796
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:52,030
- Why?
- It's a theme night.

797
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:55,152
A fan theme night,
based around us.

798
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:58,033
Come on!
That's a bit of a stretch, isn't it?

799
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:01,231
- What makes you think that?
- Big sign just over there.

800
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:07,198
Fans... of us.

801
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:09,595
- Do you think we're here?
- What?

802
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:11,915
The famous future us.

803
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:13,632
Oh, my God. I hope not.

804
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:22,558
- Yes. It is me. Hello!
- What the hell are you doing?

805
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:24,636
Chill out, Ray. These are my people!

806
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:29,470
- No, they're not, and this isn't even our time!
- Can't we just soak up a bit of a laugh?

807
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,476
No, we can't.

808
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,670
Now this is what I call a future.

809
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:38,589
Well, tough. Because we are just here
to find Pete and get the hell out of here.

810
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:40,790
So you just stay where I can see you.

811
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,155
Oh!

812
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:49,196
Guys? Is it the real you?

813
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,116
- It's the real us.
- Oh!

814
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:56,790
- Did you touch yourself?
- No, but I think... I've broken time.

815
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:59,434
- The whole world is full of us!
- You haven't broken time...

816
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:02,199
Yes, Pete.
What you did was very, very dangerous.

817
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,959
I want you to promise me
that you will never do it again.

818
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,228
No.

819
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:07,918
What's that?

820
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:09,951
Someone slapped it on me.

821
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:15,630
- He won the Pete lookalike competition.
- Well, he does look a lot like him. You do.

822
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,636
I wonder if they did one for me?

823
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:25,759
OK, let's go.

824
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:28,637
- Oh, guys!
- What?

825
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:29,669
Look.

826
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,156
Oh!

827
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,792
Look at the table.

828
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:36,398
I'm writing.

829
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:39,830
I'm Jesus...
and I'm writing.

830
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:44,592
It's that letter to Hollywood.

831
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:47,677
This isn't my fault as well, is it?
When I broke time.

832
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:50,598
This is probably something else, Pete.

833
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:55,714
- Are you sure it's that letter?
- It's blank in the painting but I left it on that table.

834
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,716
It has to be that.

835
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:00,877
Someone does a painting of us
because we slag off some films?

836
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:03,388
Of course it sounds stupid
if you put it like that.

837
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:06,193
You ripped that page
out of your little book, right?

838
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:09,516
- Yeah, and?
- Was there anything on the back?

839
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:13,076
Might have been.

840
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:16,112
- Might have been?
- Shut up! I'm just trying to think!

841
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,714
Every time I come up with a genius idea,

842
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,991
or one of you says something stupid,
I put it in there.

843
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:25,632
God, it could be anything.

844
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:28,478
- It doesn't matter what it is.
- What do you mean?

845
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:33,719
Well, you don't do paintings of nobodies.
Whatever I wrote, it turned us into somebodies.

846
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:38,151
I think it is safe to say,
we are rich and we are famous!

847
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:39,792
Then why aren't we smiling?

848
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:42,957
I don't know.
Maybe the artist wasn't very good at teeth.

849
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,879
- Maybe it's a memorial?
- Oh! Drop it with the bodies.

850
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:48,512
His woman said she'd fixed it.

851
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:52,155
She said she'd fixed the time leak
and I got chased about by monsters.

852
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,760
If Cassie said that we are safe,
then we are safe.

853
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,313
I trust her.

854
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:59,477
- Are you sure?
- Yes. Sure.

855
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:03,472
- Let's go.
- Whoa! Slow down!

856
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:05,272
Got to finish this drink.

857
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:06,958
Where did you get that?

858
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,434
Some waiter guy.
It's a free bar. Hm-mm!

859
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:13,189
- Like to stock up on the buffet while we're here?
- There's a buffet?!

860
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:14,229
Oh!

861
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:17,238
Hey, guys. The cavalry's here.

862
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,111
- Cassie says hello.
- You know Cassie?

863
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:21,594
I trained her.
Sergeant Porter, Causal Adjust.

864
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:25,076
But you can call me Millie. Hi!
I'm here to get you home.

865
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:26,917
Oh, hello, Millie!

866
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:29,554
We have been looking
for you guys everywhere!

867
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:32,672
Oh, so... Wh... Is... Are we safe?
We don't get killed?

868
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:37,350
Oh, well, officially I can't comment,
but unofficially everything's sorted.

869
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,956
But I still get rich and famous?

870
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,709
Officially I cannot comment but,
unofficially, you get your own island.

871
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,432
Yes!

872
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:50,715
- So how do we get out of here?
- Leave that to me.

873
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,239
- OK.
- OK.

874
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:53,474
Come on!

875
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:59,038
OK, a little bit weird but, erm,
it turns out everybody in the future is American.

876
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,075
Come on!

877
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:12,276
I thought she'd do something more
than tell us to get back in the bogs.

878
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:14,038
Yeah, me too.

879
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:15,911
So, are we back?

880
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:24,039
We're back!

881
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:27,436
Yeah, but at what time
of night exactly?

882
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:37,352
We can't slag off sequels.
There have been some really good sequels.

883
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:40,472
- Like?
- Like, er...

884
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:43,318
Mad Max II, Godfather II...

885
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:46,113
Yeah, well for every
good one there are...

886
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:49,994
- I wish they'd hurry up and bugger off.
- It's going to be another little while.

887
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:52,918
Look at us. Not a care in the world.

888
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:55,520
They have no idea what's in store.

889
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:59,075
Yeah. We look so happy.

890
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:05,631
OK, ladies.
We know they stay there for a while.

891
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:07,557
I think it's worth the risk.

892
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,108
Going to get some peanuts.

893
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:15,436
Didn't shake hands.
What are you, 12?

894
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:18,950
I swear to you.
I saw myself right here.

895
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:24,636
Where are my crisps?
I'm starving.

896
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:26,750
The bar was a little busy.

897
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:27,869
Maybe later.

898
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:31,071
Get my money ready.

899
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:34,556
Are we going to go in? Brilliant!

900
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:37,393
Am I really that fat?

901
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:40,273
Well, they say that
time travel adds 20 pounds.

902
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:44,359
And you've travelled a lot.

903
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:48,473
- Are those two dead?
- What? What do you mean?

904
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:50,238
Are those two dead?

905
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:52,191
Oh, no, not yet.

906
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:55,314
Finally!

907
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:08,518
Are we ready, children?

908
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:09,913
- Come on!
- Get on with it!

909
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:17,430
Well, I never!

910
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:18,708
It's nuts.

911
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:21,149
I never would have
thought it was that.

912
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:26,839
So, do we just leave it here?

913
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:32,193
Yeah. Yeah, I assume someone
just finds it and it all goes from there.

914
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:36,432
I think, er...
I think I feel good about it.

915
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:40,112
You feel good about it, Tobe?

916
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:42,679
It was my idea.

917
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,039
My idea.

918
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:45,229
Our idea.

919
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:48,238
You might have come up with the seed,
but I watered it.

920
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:51,989
Yes, but without our seed
you have nothing.

921
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:53,917
Yeah, you got mud.

922
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:56,474
All right.
You can have a little bit of my island.

923
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:58,795
Screw that!
I don't want to live on your island.

924
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:00,353
Fine by me.

925
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:01,753
I need a piss.

926
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,431
- Yes, I'll go outside.
- Don't touch yourself.

927
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:10,359
Oh-ho. Yeah. Good times.

928
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,079
I want my own island.

929
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:28,869
Hi!

930
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:32,909
I was, er, hoping you'd come back.

931
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:37,112
Obviously not at that precise moment
but, erm, hey...

932
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,117
So, how long has it been for you
since we were last...

933
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:48,391
Oh, another six months.
I got a promotion.

934
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:49,634
Oh.

935
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:51,636
This time it's for real.

936
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:55,752
Yeah, it was for sorting all this out, so...

937
00:57:57,560 --> 00:58:02,236
- You want to ask me if I read the whole manual.
- Thought never even crossed my mind.

938
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:04,874
Well, Ray, I am rewriting the manual.

939
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:06,239
Good for you.

940
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:11,152
So, erm,
you have a nice night tonight?

941
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:14,636
Oh, you know, just a quiet drink
with the boys in the pub.

942
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:16,352
Very dull.

943
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:20,193
- I did meet this one girl though.
- Really?

944
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:23,676
- She said she was from the future.
- What was she like?

945
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:25,836
She was just...

946
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:28,755
...awful.

947
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:31,553
- Oh!
- Oh, no, she was great. She was...

948
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:32,874
...great.

949
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:38,997
You know, I'd never thought I'd say it but...
it's good to be back in the present.

950
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:43,549
I don't know.
All this fuss over half an hour.

951
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:47,149
What are you talking about?
We went years in the future. Decades.

952
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,270
Oh? That's very funny.

953
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:53,791
Cassie, I'm deadly serious.
We went into the ladies' through a time leak.

954
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:57,276
It brought us to this pub
but in the future, way into the future.

955
00:58:57,320 --> 00:59:01,199
You were searching for us. Millie and you
and all your lot. Causal Adjust!

956
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:04,949
- Causal Adjust is another name for the Editors.
- The who?

957
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,197
I told you about them.
They kill people at their finest hour!

958
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:10,708
- Millie is an Editor, Ray!
- Oh, shit!

959
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:14,034
She brought us back here!
Why would she do that?

960
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:16,230
Why do you think? To kill you!

961
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:17,508
Oh, no!

962
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:19,155
What do we do?

963
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,714
OK, well, I'm going to go get help.

964
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:24,354
- You just stay put.
- I've got to warn the boys!

965
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,755
- It's not safe in there!
- I can't just leave them!

966
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:30,076
Look, you bring help and I'll, er...

967
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:31,633
I'll do what I can.

968
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:32,908
Ray!

969
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:36,549
Please be careful.

970
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:46,197
Whoa!

971
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:48,231
- Guys, we're screwed!
- What?

972
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:49,793
Millie is an Editor.

973
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:51,114
- A what?
- An Editor.

974
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:55,790
Remember, they kill people at their
finest hour like... like Kevin Costner.

975
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:59,071
- This... This was ours.
- Come on. Let's get out of here.

976
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:03,399
No-no-no! Wait. There's no point.

977
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:06,159
They'll only find us,
some other time, some other place.

978
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:07,553
What do we do, Ray?

979
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:11,520
That's odd. I can't get a signal.

980
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:12,788
We burn this.

981
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:14,114
- What?
- We burn this.

982
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:18,153
- Without this they have no reason to kill us.
- You don't know we're in danger.

983
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:20,430
- Cassie said...
- I don't care what she said!

984
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:24,632
- Tobe, I saw this place full of bodies.
- Think about what you're throwing away.

985
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:27,513
If you burn that, we don't get rich,
we don't get famous.

986
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:28,709
We don't get dead!

987
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:31,877
I've come up with a lot of ideas,
a lot of shit ideas.

988
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:33,512
- Tobe!
- You laugh at them but...

989
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:36,996
I don't mind because I thought,
you know, if I keep going, then...

990
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:39,508
one day I'd come up
with something good.

991
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:42,438
What if this is it?
The one idea that makes it for me?

992
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:43,913
My one chance.

993
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:49,195
- Don't ruin it, Ray.
- It's not even your idea. I say we burn it.

994
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:53,233
- You've always hated my ideas!
- Are you even listening? It's not your idea!

995
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:55,953
Guys, guys! OK, guys.
We don't have time for this!

996
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,116
Just, Pete, give me the lighter.

997
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:08,351
Pete, what's up with this?

998
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:11,710
Two months in a wood trying to stay alive,
that's what's up.

999
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:14,354
OK. You keep trying.
I'm going to get some matches.

1000
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:18,429
- Give me a go.
- No.

1001
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:19,915
- Give me a go!
- No!

1002
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:21,439
I'll be fine, just give me a go.

1003
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:23,471
Excuse me.

1004
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:25,590
- Hi!
- Hey! What's happening?

1005
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:28,393
- We're on our own. I'm offline.
- What do you mean?

1006
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:30,670
My time machine inside me,
it's blocked.

1007
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:33,871
- Give me the letter. Just give it me.
- No! No way!

1008
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:37,629
- Give me the fucking letter, Pete!
- Not a chance!

1009
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:40,558
And so you deny me three times.
That's why you were in the painting!

1010
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:42,079
You're Judas!

1011
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:44,839
Excuse me!
All I want is a box of matches.

1012
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:47,075
What's your point?

1013
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:50,430
In the Bible,
it's Peter who denies Jesus three times.

1014
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:52,596
You fat twat!

1015
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:55,236
Hey! That's enough, lads!

1016
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:56,713
Bloody students!

1017
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:58,637
Get off me, you bell-end!

1018
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,274
This is it.

1019
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:14,199
Hi!

1020
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:19,513
I have seen the original before,
of course, but in a museum,

1021
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:23,394
so to be here tonight with the
creators on the night it all began...

1022
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:26,318
Whew! It's just such a rush.

1023
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:30,478
But I am sorry to say,
tonight is as good as it gets.

1024
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:33,956
You don't change or add to culture
in any meaningful way.

1025
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,719
This is what you're always
gonna be remembered for,

1026
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:40,878
so why not go out with a bang
rather than fade away?

1027
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:43,275
Get away from him, you bitch!

1028
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:48,553
Hello! I'm sorry.
I'm pointing a rather large gun at you!

1029
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:52,079
Er, yeah, which you got
from when exactly?

1030
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:54,190
Centuries behind your time.

1031
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:55,832
So, what is it?

1032
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:58,515
What is it?

1033
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:04,792
I'll tell you...
I'll tell you what it is.

1034
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:07,513
It's a Mark IV Corbomite Assault Staff.

1035
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:09,710
The Planetary Peace Corp's best friend.

1036
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:12,877
It'll work in an absolute vacuum
and in absolute zero.

1037
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:15,115
Cold fusion battery, good for 50 years.

1038
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:19,631
It fires homing plasma orbs that will
cut through titanium plate four inches thick.

1039
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:22,035
Really? Well...

1040
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:25,679
You didn't, like, mention its range.

1041
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:28,234
I'd hit you from here.

1042
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:33,116
Now get off the big guy.

1043
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:42,077
Millie.
I know what you're trying to do.

1044
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:45,112
The future generations leading from
this room that wouldn't be born.

1045
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:46,912
Chaos Theory on a massive scale...

1046
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:48,552
Oh!

1047
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:52,509
Cassie!

1048
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:54,835
Right, that's it!
I'm calling the police...

1049
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:00,909
Oh, stop it. Fucking stop it.

1050
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:02,075
Everybody freeze!

1051
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:06,159
- Ain't nobody going nowhere.
- Hey! Drop your weapons!

1052
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:07,952
You see any weapons, Ray?

1053
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:12,278
See, my time machine
has a built-in armament system.

1054
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:15,312
So, to drop my weapons
would require about...

1055
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:17,555
yeah, 12 hours of surgery.

1056
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:19,913
You know what?

1057
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:23,316
I think we're gonna
have a little stand-off here today.

1058
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:26,636
Oh, unless of course, you're bluffing.

1059
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:28,511
Unless, of course,

1060
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:32,792
that is a plastic toy gun
you made for work, Ray.

1061
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:36,548
Oh, pooh.

1062
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:42,398
That's a nice try.

1063
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:44,913
I messed up, Ray.

1064
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:46,916
- I'm sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

1065
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:50,077
All in all,
it's been a pretty good day.

1066
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:51,997
I travelled through time.
I met you.

1067
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:53,359
You know what?

1068
01:04:54,960 --> 01:05:00,751
I am sensing a little bit of resistance
to this whole immortality deal I am offering here.

1069
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:07,189
Toby, all you have to do is destroy
that little piece of paper

1070
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:12,997
and you get to live to write another day in
your book of bad ideas and your dead-end job.

1071
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:14,439
Wow!

1072
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:19,429
Or you could give it to me
and I'll turn you all into legends.

1073
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:20,754
What do you say?

1074
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:25,838
Come on, Tobe.

1075
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:29,548
I just need a little time to think.

1076
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:32,876
What is there to think about?
She's going to fucking kill us!

1077
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:34,194
It's not that simple!

1078
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:41,559
Uh, uh, uh-uh, uh.

1079
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:44,239
Now this is his choice and his alone.

1080
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,911
Oh, no! The song!

1081
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:52,757
This fucking song!

1082
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:55,997
If there was one thing
I could change about this situation,

1083
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:58,952
it would not be the song
on the fucking jukebox!

1084
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,513
Time's up!

1085
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:04,554
Now, what's it gonna be?

1086
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:23,557
Toby!

1087
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:32,993
Fuck you.

1088
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:34,758
Chuck it!

1089
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:42,280
Nooooooo!

1090
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:42,750
- Wow!
- Jeanie Mac!

1091
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:55,870
- Did you do that?
- Yep.

1092
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:57,319
With my pint?

1093
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:00,788
- Were we just dead?
- Yeah.

1094
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:02,990
But now we're not.

1095
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:06,589
- No.
- So, what happened exactly?

1096
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:09,791
- I knocked a pint onto this.
- My pint, my pint.

1097
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:13,474
I knocked Pete's pint onto this,

1098
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:15,511
so no one could read it.

1099
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:18,711
So, the future then changed
because we didn't become famous,

1100
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:21,194
so the Editors didn't
send anybody to kill us.

1101
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:22,355
Wow.

1102
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:26,231
I think you got that wrong.

1103
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:27,508
Why?

1104
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:32,793
Pete downed his pint, didn't he?
So, that was probably my pint.

1105
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:37,910
Jesus! Could we focus on
the "us being alive again" thing?

1106
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:40,633
Well, yeah, obviously.
Well done, Ray.

1107
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:43,558
Is that it? Is it all over?

1108
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:45,113
We're all OK?

1109
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:46,718
Yeah, I think so.

1110
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:49,831
Wow.

1111
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:52,030
I've gone off this pub a little bit.

1112
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:54,469
- Shall we go down The King's Head?
- Why not?

1113
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:58,559
- So, everything that happened...
- Couldn't happen. Didn't happen.

1114
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:02,351
Including me meeting Cassie.

1115
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:08,476
Yeah. Come on, let's go.

1116
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:16,548
I swear I will never use
a pub toilet again.

1117
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:17,794
It's too dangerous.

1118
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,990
That's all you're taking away
from this evening?

1119
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:22,429
- No!
- So, we're definitely safe now?

1120
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:24,072
- I suppose.
- Suppose?!

1121
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:26,429
You're the nerds.
Can't you work it out?

1122
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:30,314
Well, yeah. Time resets, so the pub
was never full of dead people.

1123
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:33,192
So, you owe me a tenner. Come on!

1124
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:36,676
OK, then, if time reset,
the bet never happened.

1125
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:50,990
Well, I did only say "suppose".

1126
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:56,913
It's Cassie!

1127
01:11:56,960 --> 01:12:00,191
Ray! Oh, thank God you're alive!

1128
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:11,035
Oh! So, you remember me, then?

1129
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:12,877
Of course I remember you.

1130
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:15,195
We've been going out for two years.

1131
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:16,753
What? Really?

1132
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:17,949
- Two years?
- Yeah.

1133
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,831
That's, er... Wow!

1134
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:21,279
Oh, er...

1135
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:24,231
Right, this is Pete and Tobe.

1136
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:26,032
- Hiya.
- Hello.

1137
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:27,593
This is Cassie.

1138
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:29,995
She's my girlfriend!

1139
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:32,752
When you knocked that pint over,

1140
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:35,553
you created a feedback loop
through the fabric of space-time.

1141
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:38,068
The repercussions have been enormous.
Leaks everywhere.

1142
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:40,839
Whoa! Two years, huh?

1143
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:42,875
Wow!

1144
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:46,595
So, we must have...
Have we had any of the?

1145
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:48,232
Hmm?

1146
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:50,555
I don't know what you're talking about.

1147
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:55,149
Unless, of course, you mean sex,
which yeah, we've done that lots.

1148
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:57,599
Lots!

1149
01:12:59,720 --> 01:13:01,950
Was I any good?

1150
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,355
I love you but we only have
14 hours to save the earth!

1151
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:06,834
- You have to come with me now!
- Oh, OK.

1152
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:08,757
Yeah. Good luck with that, guys.

1153
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:12,918
- Yeah. We'll be in The King's Head.
- What? You guys have to come too.

1154
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:15,474
I've done enough time travel
for one night, thanks.

1155
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:18,239
It's not time travel.
It's a parallel universe.

1156
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:20,874
- Parallel universe?
- Let's go. The portal is closing!

1157
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:23,275
- What the fuck's a portal?
- Come on!

1158
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:28,831
Why don't you two go? Someone should
stay and look after the coats and bags.

1159
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:31,997
Besides, I thought I might go
for your job on the Star Ride.

1160
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:33,598
I was going to apply for that!

1161
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:36,234
Guys, guys! Listen to yourselves!

1162
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:39,238
Look! This is our one chance
to do something important.

1163
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:41,350
Yeah, we might fuck it up.

1164
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:44,794
To be honest, we probably will.

1165
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:47,434
OK, we definitely will. But...

1166
01:13:47,480 --> 01:13:48,754
Who's with me?

1167
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:52,308
Please?

1168
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:01,878
- As long as we're back for last orders.
