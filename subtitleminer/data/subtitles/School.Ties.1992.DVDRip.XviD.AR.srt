00:02:37,623 --> 00:02:39,580
Hey, David!

2
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:57,512
Davey!
Oh, Davey, come here!

3
00:02:57,685 --> 00:03:01,433
Edie, he's not going off to war,
only Massachusetts.

4
00:03:03,691 --> 00:03:06,396
Here, Davey... For the trip.

5
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:10,234
Edie gives something away!
I'll have a heart attack!

6
00:03:11,031 --> 00:03:14,447
Go and become a gentleman,
not like this riff-raff.

7
00:03:14,618 --> 00:03:18,912
We ought to kick his butt
for breaking up the team.

8
00:03:19,081 --> 00:03:21,786
Hey!
You want to stay in here?

9
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,786
If I had your brains, I'd go.

10
00:03:24,962 --> 00:03:28,912
- His brains? Any brains!
- Look who's talking.

11
00:03:29,258 --> 00:03:31,334
- I don't know.
- What?

12
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:36,468
- I don't know about that place.
- You know it's not this place.

13
00:03:39,518 --> 00:03:42,353
- Oh, shit. Kocus.
- So what?

14
00:03:42,521 --> 00:03:46,021
The night before last,
his sister gave me a hand job.

15
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:48,683
- Her idea.
- Yeah, right.

16
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,399
- Hey, Bear.
- Hey, Kocus.

17
00:03:56,368 --> 00:04:01,445
We was thinking about going in there,
you know, eat something.

18
00:04:01,624 --> 00:04:06,749
- I don't think it would be a good idea.
- Why not? They let Jews in there.

19
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:13,128
Your sister can come in,
only she'll have to wash her hands.

20
00:04:16,388 --> 00:04:19,389
You got a Jew friend
with a smart mouth.

21
00:04:19,558 --> 00:04:23,508
- I guess I do.
- It don't bother you they killed Jesus?

22
00:04:23,687 --> 00:04:26,261
No. I didn't know the man.

23
00:04:26,857 --> 00:04:30,985
It bothers the shit out of me,
you sheeny bastard!

24
00:04:31,153 --> 00:04:34,071
Hey! Take it to the alley!

25
00:04:49,713 --> 00:04:54,340
Yo, man! Come on!
Don't let him do that! Come on! Yeah!

26
00:04:55,302 --> 00:04:57,211
Hit the Jew!

27
00:05:23,163 --> 00:05:25,239
Give 'em hell, kid!

28
00:05:29,795 --> 00:05:31,871
You're late.

29
00:05:51,233 --> 00:05:53,309
Look at me.

30
00:05:53,777 --> 00:05:57,193
- Goddamnit, David.
- I had to.

31
00:05:57,364 --> 00:06:02,192
- Such an opportunity and you do this!
- I had to!

32
00:06:02,369 --> 00:06:05,536
This is a school
two presidents went to.

33
00:06:05,706 --> 00:06:09,834
They'll think you're a hoodlum.
They might send you back.

34
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:12,078
- Fine.
- Fine?

35
00:06:14,673 --> 00:06:18,837
Take a look at this place.
You want this life?

36
00:06:19,553 --> 00:06:23,421
He called me a sheeny bastard.
Should I walk away?

37
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:28,142
Yes. It ain't your problem.
You can't fight your way through life.

38
00:06:28,312 --> 00:06:33,223
- You never got into any fights?
- Sure, but nobody handed me Harvard.

39
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:49,953
- You're going to miss the bus.
- We'll make it.

40
00:06:51,293 --> 00:06:54,662
- Who did you fight with?
- Kocus.

41
00:07:00,135 --> 00:07:02,093
OK, kids.

42
00:07:02,262 --> 00:07:06,592
You can fit in or hack around
with a chip on your shoulder.

43
00:07:06,767 --> 00:07:13,019
- All right. All right, I'll fit in.
- They came to you, not you to them.

44
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:17,982
You don't have to explain
nothing to nobody. Understand?

45
00:07:18,153 --> 00:07:20,229
All right.

46
00:07:24,827 --> 00:07:28,196
Right. Say goodbye
to your brother and sister.

47
00:07:28,372 --> 00:07:31,539
- Goodbye, Sarah.
- Bye, David.

48
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,706
Bye, Petey.

49
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:48,762
You kids wait over there.

50
00:07:51,895 --> 00:07:53,971
Change your shirt.

51
00:07:55,774 --> 00:07:59,226
- What did the other guy look like?
- Worse.

52
00:08:06,493 --> 00:08:10,538
- You're sounding like Grandpa.
- You should be so lucky.

53
00:08:14,793 --> 00:08:16,869
Got to go, Dad.

54
00:08:24,178 --> 00:08:26,419
Go. Make us proud.

55
00:08:33,103 --> 00:08:35,262
- Bye.
- Bye.

56
00:09:35,624 --> 00:09:38,376
- Hi, Coach.
- Welcome to Cabot.

57
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:48,635
I had a little accident.
It's nothing.

58
00:09:50,097 --> 00:09:53,051
- Let me get this for you.
- Thanks.

59
00:10:11,285 --> 00:10:14,155
- How was your trip?
- Fine. I slept.

60
00:10:14,329 --> 00:10:17,081
- Good. How's your dad?
- Fine.

61
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:20,203
He's pretty excited about all this.

62
00:10:20,377 --> 00:10:23,248
- What father wouldn't be?
- Yeah.

63
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:26,257
The team's looking forward
to meeting you.

64
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:30,090
Good. I'm looking forward
to meeting them, too.

65
00:10:58,665 --> 00:11:03,742
- Jesus, this is a high school!
- Yeah. It's your high school.

66
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:30,855
- Thanks for the lift.
- I'll get your bag.

67
00:11:38,288 --> 00:11:41,373
Thanks.
I'll see you at practice.

68
00:11:42,626 --> 00:11:47,869
Just a minute. I meant to ask you...
Do you have any diet problems?

69
00:11:48,048 --> 00:11:52,176
- Diet problems?
- Is there anything you can't eat?

70
00:11:54,012 --> 00:11:57,713
- Turnips.
- Turnips. I can't eat them, either.

71
00:11:57,891 --> 00:11:59,967
I'd better let you get settled.

72
00:12:00,143 --> 00:12:04,604
- The kids will be curious about you.
- I'm curious about them.

73
00:12:04,773 --> 00:12:08,985
Nobody comes here for just
their last year. It's unusual.

74
00:12:09,736 --> 00:12:14,315
They're great kids, don't get me wrong.
But they're privileged.

75
00:12:14,491 --> 00:12:17,825
They take a lot for granted
you and I never would.

76
00:12:17,995 --> 00:12:21,198
Just play your cards
close to the vest.

77
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:23,366
What do you mean?

78
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:26,958
Don't tell people
more than they need to know.

79
00:12:28,797 --> 00:12:31,549
- See you at practice.
- All right.

80
00:13:20,223 --> 00:13:23,842
- Hi! Chris Reece, your roommate.
- Hi! David Greene.

81
00:13:24,019 --> 00:13:27,969
Pleased to meet you. Rip Van Kelt,
Jack Connors, Charlie Dillon.

82
00:13:28,148 --> 00:13:30,271
We're the big men on campus.

83
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:33,023
- It's true.
- Where you from?

84
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:35,770
- Scranton, PA.
- Scranton?

85
00:13:35,947 --> 00:13:39,032
- It's in America, Connors.
- No shit.

86
00:13:39,201 --> 00:13:42,451
You're the first ringer
St Matt's ever hired.

87
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:46,665
- Dillon...
- No, he is. It's an honour.

88
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:50,451
- Aren't you honoured?
- I hadn't thought about it.

89
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:55,172
- The best quarterback money can buy.
- Dillon, lay off!

90
00:13:58,011 --> 00:14:01,380
Don't pay any attention to him.
Peanuts?

91
00:14:01,556 --> 00:14:03,466
No problem.

92
00:14:05,018 --> 00:14:08,138
Even in Scranton, a prick's a prick.

93
00:14:08,313 --> 00:14:13,473
You don't have to be so sensitive.
Come on, it's not required here.

94
00:14:14,611 --> 00:14:18,360
There was some talk about me
playing quarterback, so...

95
00:14:18,532 --> 00:14:21,651
- Were you in an accident?
- I got into a fight.

96
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:24,318
- Seriously?
- A fistfight?

97
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:29,074
- Kind of a going-away fight.
- What, you mean like a rumble?

98
00:14:29,251 --> 00:14:32,038
- Yeah, like a rumble.
- Over girls and stuff?

99
00:14:32,212 --> 00:14:37,551
There's a place we hang out and these
motorcycle guys wanted to come in.

100
00:14:37,717 --> 00:14:40,090
- Bikers.
- We wouldn't let them.

101
00:14:40,262 --> 00:14:43,512
- You didn't want them on your turf?
- Right.

102
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:47,430
Everybody knows not to go
on someone else's turf.

103
00:14:47,602 --> 00:14:51,600
Who knows what evil
lurks in the hearts of men?

104
00:14:51,773 --> 00:14:53,980
The Shadow knows.

105
00:14:55,402 --> 00:14:59,269
Crime does not pay.
The Shadow knows.

106
00:14:59,448 --> 00:15:01,524
McGiv! My roomie!

107
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:07,538
David Greene,
our new quarterback.

108
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:10,244
- This is Mac.
- How do you do?

109
00:15:10,417 --> 00:15:12,493
Hi.

110
00:15:14,045 --> 00:15:19,716
Football is a game for bug squashers,
cretins and criminals. Don't you agree?

111
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:25,306
- Mac wants to play, but he's too frail.
- So we let him be student manager.

112
00:15:26,391 --> 00:15:30,970
That's it! I'm going to kick
your smelly ass back to Greenwich.

113
00:15:33,023 --> 00:15:35,728
I guess you didn't get a school tie
yet.

114
00:15:37,486 --> 00:15:40,190
Here, you can wear this one.

115
00:15:40,363 --> 00:15:44,824
I got extras because I'm always
dragging them through the soup.

116
00:15:44,993 --> 00:15:46,986
Thanks.

117
00:15:50,165 --> 00:15:54,412
You mind if I ask...
How did you wind up here?

118
00:15:55,128 --> 00:15:58,960
- I'm not supposed to talk about it.
- Let me guess.

119
00:15:59,132 --> 00:16:04,127
Coach McDevitt visited and said
you could get an alumni scholarship?

120
00:16:04,554 --> 00:16:06,879
Good guess.
How did you know?

121
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:11,466
St Luke's has whipped us
for three years in a row.

122
00:16:11,645 --> 00:16:15,393
The alumni are pissed.
They want to win real bad.

123
00:16:16,441 --> 00:16:18,813
Not too much pressure, huh?

124
00:16:20,403 --> 00:16:22,479
I want a good seat at the back.

125
00:16:22,656 --> 00:16:25,491
It's different from public schools.

126
00:16:25,659 --> 00:16:29,028
Chapel three times a week.
But it's not that bad.

127
00:16:29,204 --> 00:16:31,280
No kidding?

128
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,675
Gentlemen of St Matthew's...

129
00:17:35,937 --> 00:17:40,149
...welcome to the finest
preparatory school in the nation.

130
00:17:41,151 --> 00:17:47,485
Welcome especially to our new boys.
I am Dr Bartram, your headmaster.

131
00:17:47,657 --> 00:17:51,737
The rest of you may
conceivably remember me.

132
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:56,992
His annual joke.
Make the most of it.

133
00:17:57,167 --> 00:18:00,536
Tomorrow begins the 193rd fall term.

134
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:05,504
No, I was not in office
when the first one began.

135
00:18:05,675 --> 00:18:08,047
Some of you new boys may find

136
00:18:08,219 --> 00:18:12,300
that academics and discipline
here are very demanding.

137
00:18:12,474 --> 00:18:14,929
Much of what is policy here,

138
00:18:15,101 --> 00:18:19,680
including our cherished Honour Code,
has been established,

139
00:18:19,856 --> 00:18:23,984
not by me or your teachers,
but by your fellow students,

140
00:18:24,152 --> 00:18:27,936
to be enforced
by your own tribunal of prefects,

141
00:18:28,114 --> 00:18:31,614
as it has been
for the last two centuries.

142
00:18:32,452 --> 00:18:34,694
We judge ourselves here,

143
00:18:34,871 --> 00:18:39,083
and we judge ourselves
by the highest standards.

144
00:18:40,293 --> 00:18:43,496
You, my boys, are among
the elite of the nation,

145
00:18:43,672 --> 00:18:46,163
and we strive at St Matthew's

146
00:18:46,341 --> 00:18:51,680
to prepare you for the responsibility
that comes with favoured position.

147
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:56,466
Today, more than ever,
this country needs an elite

148
00:18:56,643 --> 00:19:00,142
that cares more for honour
than for advantage;

149
00:19:01,356 --> 00:19:05,733
more for service
than for personal gain.

150
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:12,399
To that end,
let us beseech the help of God,

151
00:19:12,575 --> 00:19:15,113
in whose name we pray.

152
00:19:21,084 --> 00:19:25,793
Our Father, who art in Heaven,
Hallowed be Thy name...

153
00:20:04,544 --> 00:20:08,589
- Decent hi-fi, Mac.
- Bought it from a friend back home.

154
00:20:08,757 --> 00:20:11,674
- How much?
- I jewed him down to $30.

155
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:13,919
I'll give you $25 for it.

156
00:20:14,095 --> 00:20:17,262
He always wants
something for nothing.

157
00:20:17,432 --> 00:20:19,306
And he's not even Jewish.

158
00:20:21,978 --> 00:20:25,228
- Evening, gentlemen.
- Evening, sir.

159
00:20:25,982 --> 00:20:28,058
Evening.

160
00:20:29,277 --> 00:20:33,986
Whose music is that?
And I use the term advisedly.

161
00:20:34,157 --> 00:20:37,573
- That's the great sound of The Robins.
- No.

162
00:20:37,744 --> 00:20:40,780
I mean the man who would purchase
such swill.

163
00:20:40,955 --> 00:20:44,289
- That would be me.
- That would be I.

164
00:20:48,546 --> 00:20:52,164
- Have you a name?
- McGivern.

165
00:20:52,342 --> 00:20:54,714
- And you?
- Mr Cleary.

166
00:20:55,804 --> 00:21:00,216
I happen to be the new housemaster.

167
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:04,431
Turn it off, please.

168
00:21:07,023 --> 00:21:10,937
One's cultural environment
ought to be as important

169
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:14,396
as the air he breathes
and the food he eats.

170
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:32,666
- Surely, in your day, you had music?
- Yes, and my day has not passed.

171
00:21:32,841 --> 00:21:34,917
Dave Brubeck, Ray Anthony,

172
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:37,584
Les Elgart, Mitch Miller,

173
00:21:37,762 --> 00:21:40,218
Les Baxter, Roger Williams...

174
00:21:41,516 --> 00:21:44,268
We'll have no problem.

175
00:21:44,435 --> 00:21:47,057
Gentlemen, we all have to live here.

176
00:21:47,438 --> 00:21:52,859
But we're not going to bring the jungle
into my house, thank you very much.

177
00:22:27,854 --> 00:22:31,187
God, Greene,
where did you get the balls?

178
00:22:34,527 --> 00:22:38,477
- You are in.
- I hope all the teachers aren't like him.

179
00:22:38,656 --> 00:22:41,693
Most are OK.
Who'd you get for History?

180
00:22:41,868 --> 00:22:44,573
- Gierasch.
- Me, too. He's tough.

181
00:22:44,746 --> 00:22:46,619
- French?
- Renard.

182
00:22:46,789 --> 00:22:50,123
Good. We'll get him talking
and go to sleep.

183
00:22:50,293 --> 00:22:52,914
- You shower morning or night?
- Night.

184
00:22:53,087 --> 00:22:56,836
Hurry up.
We'll just make it before lights out.

185
00:23:42,011 --> 00:23:44,087
What a beautiful day.

186
00:23:48,601 --> 00:23:50,890
Renard will be a breeze.

187
00:24:05,076 --> 00:24:06,570
Well...

188
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:10,159
Well, well.

189
00:24:11,457 --> 00:24:14,292
My musical upstairs neighbours.

190
00:24:17,922 --> 00:24:21,125
Please, do sit down.

191
00:24:22,635 --> 00:24:26,847
Monsieur Renard is cutting back
on his teaching load,

192
00:24:27,015 --> 00:24:32,471
so I will have the pleasure
of teaching this section of French 4.

193
00:25:04,552 --> 00:25:06,426
I don't understand...

194
00:25:29,744 --> 00:25:31,820
You know how a team works.

195
00:25:31,996 --> 00:25:34,997
I wasn't the quarterback
you wanted.

196
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:40,042
- You are our number one back-up.
- But I'd better play halfback.

197
00:25:40,213 --> 00:25:44,376
It's our weakest spot now.
You'll make a great halfback.

198
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:48,963
You can run and you can block.
You've got all the stuff, kid.

199
00:25:49,138 --> 00:25:52,922
- And I'll give it my best.
- I'm counting on it.

200
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:56,182
Listen up!

201
00:25:56,354 --> 00:26:00,683
New face on the varsity this year.
David Greene.

202
00:26:00,858 --> 00:26:03,776
- Greene comes from Pennsylvania.
- Hi.

203
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,194
Played quarterback.

204
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:10,860
Led his team to a championship win
last year in a tough league.

205
00:26:11,035 --> 00:26:14,071
This year,
we're concentrating on passing.

206
00:26:14,247 --> 00:26:16,323
McGivern has some new plays.

207
00:26:16,499 --> 00:26:20,579
If captured, eat them.
If still alive, meet here tomorrow.

208
00:26:21,754 --> 00:26:24,874
We'll run them through tomorrow.

209
00:26:25,049 --> 00:26:28,714
Today, let's get out there
and warm up. Hit it!

210
00:26:47,113 --> 00:26:49,189
- Hi, Coach.
- Dillon.

211
00:26:50,741 --> 00:26:53,232
Hi, Dillon.
How was practice?

212
00:26:55,246 --> 00:26:57,322
How was practice!

213
00:27:09,093 --> 00:27:11,880
- Where's Greene?
- I don't know.

214
00:27:12,054 --> 00:27:15,720
- I thought he'd be here.
- Save a place for him, huh?

215
00:27:16,309 --> 00:27:19,428
- Like this...
- Will you get off me!

216
00:27:49,133 --> 00:27:51,706
Thank you, God,
for your bountiful gifts...

217
00:27:52,178 --> 00:27:54,883
- I'm holding my own.
- <i>And French?</i>

218
00:27:55,056 --> 00:27:59,385
- Hate the teacher.
- <i>Everybody hates at least one.</i>

219
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,885
I'd better get back to the books.

220
00:28:02,063 --> 00:28:04,636
- Talk soon.
- <i>Don't forget Saturday.</i>

221
00:28:04,815 --> 00:28:07,520
- Saturday?
- It's Rosh Hashanah.

222
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:12,571
I've got a game against Winchester,
Pop.

223
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:16,156
It's a very holy day.
It goes back longer than us.

224
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:20,027
You show respect and get to temple.

225
00:28:20,206 --> 00:28:22,875
<i>Davey, do you hear me?</i>
<i>No excuses.</i>

226
00:28:23,084 --> 00:28:26,203
OK.
Sure, don't worry, Pop.

227
00:28:27,129 --> 00:28:30,664
- I'll speak to you next week.
- <i>OK. Bye.</i>

228
00:28:34,887 --> 00:28:36,547
Down!

229
00:28:39,976 --> 00:28:41,636
Set!

230
00:28:42,895 --> 00:28:44,769
Go! Go!

231
00:28:53,864 --> 00:28:57,732
St Matt's, third and five,
on the Winchester 41.

232
00:28:58,828 --> 00:29:00,488
Two!

233
00:29:00,663 --> 00:29:02,241
Three!

234
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:24,182
<i>St Matt's touchdown.</i>
<i>St Matt's six. Winchester nothing.</i>

235
00:29:24,979 --> 00:29:27,517
That boy's good.
What's his name?

236
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:31,853
Van Kelt. The boys call him Rip.
He's the team captain.

237
00:29:32,028 --> 00:29:35,278
I think he means the boy
who threw the pass.

238
00:29:35,448 --> 00:29:38,318
Oh. That's David Greene.

239
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:15,399
<i>The score is tied seven apiece.</i>

240
00:30:15,571 --> 00:30:20,731
<i>St Matt's ball, third and seven</i>
<i>on the Winchester forty-yard line.</i>

241
00:30:24,997 --> 00:30:26,657
Set!

242
00:30:27,249 --> 00:30:28,909
Down!

243
00:30:29,835 --> 00:30:31,744
Set... One!

244
00:30:34,131 --> 00:30:35,791
Go!

245
00:30:45,434 --> 00:30:47,391
Yeah!

246
00:30:49,647 --> 00:30:52,102
<i>Touchdown, St Matt's!</i>

247
00:31:00,157 --> 00:31:03,858
We've got a quarterback!
We've found our quarterback!

248
00:31:10,042 --> 00:31:12,616
- <i>Lights out!</i>
- <i>Lights out!</i>

249
00:31:22,221 --> 00:31:25,424
You go ahead, dear.
I'll be right there.

250
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,276
Who is it?

251
00:31:47,246 --> 00:31:52,122
- David Greene, sir.
- What are you doing here, Greene?

252
00:31:52,293 --> 00:31:54,119
Praying, sir.

253
00:31:54,295 --> 00:31:57,628
I imagine your God allows prayer
during daylight.

254
00:31:57,798 --> 00:32:03,137
I couldn't get away before.
It's Rosh Hashanah, Jewish New Year.

255
00:32:03,304 --> 00:32:05,510
I know what Rosh Hashanah is.

256
00:32:05,681 --> 00:32:08,884
And it ends at sunset
if I recall the custom.

257
00:32:09,059 --> 00:32:14,599
Technically. But it wouldn't go over
too well if I said I couldn't play.

258
00:32:14,773 --> 00:32:19,352
- My scholarship depends on football.
- Yes. I saw the game.

259
00:32:19,528 --> 00:32:23,360
You seemed thoroughly concentrated
on the task.

260
00:32:23,532 --> 00:32:25,608
Thank you, sir.

261
00:32:26,494 --> 00:32:31,950
You people are very determined,
aren't you?

262
00:32:32,124 --> 00:32:35,493
Sometimes we have to be, sir.

263
00:32:35,669 --> 00:32:37,745
I seem to recall a blessing:

264
00:32:37,922 --> 00:32:41,966
"Blessed are the meek,
for they shall inherit the earth."

265
00:32:42,134 --> 00:32:45,052
I wonder how meek they'll be
when they do, sir.

266
00:32:45,221 --> 00:32:48,056
Are you finished here, Mr Greene?

267
00:32:50,142 --> 00:32:52,135
Yes, sir.

268
00:32:52,311 --> 00:32:55,478
Then I suggest
you sneak back to your room.

269
00:32:55,648 --> 00:32:59,266
I shall overlook
this evening's infraction.

270
00:33:02,404 --> 00:33:04,777
- Mr Greene?
- Sir?

271
00:33:06,325 --> 00:33:10,903
Was it worth it? Breaking a tradition
just to win a football game?

272
00:33:13,165 --> 00:33:15,739
Your tradition or mine, sir?

273
00:33:26,804 --> 00:33:30,967
The son of a bitch
gives us English to French!

274
00:33:31,141 --> 00:33:34,226
The pig won't last here.
I'll bet you.

275
00:33:34,395 --> 00:33:37,811
Won't last?
Connors, I flunked that test.

276
00:33:39,858 --> 00:33:43,144
I'm getting sick
of these goddamned bells!

277
00:34:01,338 --> 00:34:03,580
- Henry Vlll assumes throne?
- 1509.

278
00:34:03,757 --> 00:34:08,336
- 1649, Mr Smith?
- Charles I was executed.

279
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:12,841
Correct. Which resulted
in the establishment of what?

280
00:34:13,017 --> 00:34:16,267
- A commonwealth, Mr Gierasch.
- Very good.

281
00:34:16,437 --> 00:34:20,648
Mr Dillon, when did
Mary Queen of Scots lose her head?

282
00:34:21,233 --> 00:34:24,317
- 1687.
- Close. You're only a century off.

283
00:34:24,486 --> 00:34:26,396
- Mr Greene?
- 1587.

284
00:34:26,572 --> 00:34:30,901
Indeed. And what occurred
during the years 1553 to 1558?

285
00:34:31,076 --> 00:34:33,448
- Mr Collins?
- Bloody Mary.

286
00:34:33,621 --> 00:34:36,989
So it was.
Which resulted in what, Mr Reece?

287
00:34:37,166 --> 00:34:39,704
Catholicism was restored.

288
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:41,869
How come, Mr Connors?

289
00:34:42,046 --> 00:34:44,584
She married what's-his-name.

290
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:48,421
- Philip?
- Well, more or less.

291
00:34:49,678 --> 00:34:51,885
August 9th, 1593?

292
00:34:52,473 --> 00:34:54,549
Anybody?

293
00:34:55,601 --> 00:34:58,174
The birth of lzaak Walton.

294
00:34:58,354 --> 00:35:00,477
A personal favourite.

295
00:35:01,357 --> 00:35:05,022
Mr Dillon, a literary event...

296
00:35:06,779 --> 00:35:08,855
1611?

297
00:35:09,948 --> 00:35:13,531
- McGivern?
- Publication of the King James Bible.

298
00:35:13,702 --> 00:35:15,778
Correct.

299
00:35:16,914 --> 00:35:20,034
You care to try for three, Mr Dillon?

300
00:35:21,251 --> 00:35:25,000
I remind you, Mr Dillon,
this course has no shallow end.

301
00:35:25,172 --> 00:35:27,046
Sink or swim.

302
00:35:27,633 --> 00:35:31,547
If I don't get total tit tonight,
I'll cut my throat.

303
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,342
Sex is my only reason
for living.

304
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:37,559
Then be careful
you don't cut your hand!

305
00:35:39,061 --> 00:35:41,634
Life isn't over yet, Mac.

306
00:35:41,814 --> 00:35:44,980
When Princeton might accept
a C in French

307
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:48,353
and you're flunking French,
life is over.

308
00:35:48,529 --> 00:35:52,147
Princeton isn't
the only lvy League school.

309
00:35:54,326 --> 00:35:57,280
Someone explain
to our friend from Scranton.

310
00:35:57,454 --> 00:36:01,666
Five generations of McGiverns have
gone to Princeton.

311
00:36:01,834 --> 00:36:05,368
If I don't get in,
it means the others had cocks,

312
00:36:05,546 --> 00:36:07,622
and I just have a wee-wee.

313
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:12,837
I have trouble sympathising.
Harvard wants monthly reports on me.

314
00:36:13,303 --> 00:36:16,221
- How about you, Greene?
- Touch and go.

315
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:18,466
I'm getting a C in French.

316
00:36:18,642 --> 00:36:23,553
Dillon's brother graduates this year.
The back-up quarterbacks are thumbs.

317
00:36:23,731 --> 00:36:27,598
I wouldn't go to Harvard.
All those Jews and Communists.

318
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:31,394
- That's just the faculty.
- You are so full of shit.

319
00:36:31,572 --> 00:36:33,529
Jew-lover!

320
00:36:33,699 --> 00:36:37,198
So what if there are Jews?
They're not in the clubs.

321
00:36:37,369 --> 00:36:42,031
- That's not the point.
- It is. You don't have to be with them.

322
00:36:42,207 --> 00:36:45,410
- Why would you want to?
- I don't want to.

323
00:36:45,586 --> 00:36:48,159
Then don't go to Harvard, Dillon.

324
00:36:48,338 --> 00:36:50,414
- Help?
- How would you know?

325
00:36:50,591 --> 00:36:52,667
- What?
- If you're with them?

326
00:36:52,843 --> 00:36:58,003
Are you kidding? How would you
not know? It's hard to miss a heeb.

327
00:36:58,182 --> 00:37:00,637
Oh, God, girls,
eat your hearts out!

328
00:37:00,809 --> 00:37:06,183
Oh, no! You never mess with my hair!
I can't believe you did that!

329
00:37:06,815 --> 00:37:09,223
No way! You're dead!

330
00:37:32,174 --> 00:37:34,463
Hurry up, fellas. Come on.

331
00:38:06,708 --> 00:38:10,243
Don't forget to make room
for the Holy Ghost.

332
00:39:10,105 --> 00:39:13,770
- You can roll your tongue back up.
- She's beautiful!

333
00:39:13,942 --> 00:39:17,525
Sally Wheeler.
Dillon says she's his girlfriend.

334
00:39:17,696 --> 00:39:21,065
- Is she?
- I guess so. That's the word.

335
00:40:07,204 --> 00:40:10,869
- Isn't that your new quarterback?
- David Greene.

336
00:40:17,756 --> 00:40:20,792
He must be half nigger!
He can dance.

337
00:40:44,866 --> 00:40:46,824
Introduce me.

338
00:40:47,536 --> 00:40:49,991
- David!
- Excuse me.

339
00:40:56,003 --> 00:40:58,838
You move as well on the floor
as the field.

340
00:40:59,006 --> 00:41:02,090
- Sally Wheeler, David Greene.
- Dillon!

341
00:41:05,387 --> 00:41:09,135
- I'll be back in a minute.
- No rush.

342
00:41:10,767 --> 00:41:15,263
- I saw you dancing.
- I saw you dancing, too. With Dillon.

343
00:41:17,941 --> 00:41:20,895
- Dillon's a great guy.
- He's fun.

344
00:41:21,069 --> 00:41:22,978
Yeah.

345
00:41:27,284 --> 00:41:29,905
Do you think he'll go to Harvard?

346
00:41:30,078 --> 00:41:34,206
Is that what you do in your
spare time? Worry about Dillon?

347
00:41:36,668 --> 00:41:39,159
I don't have any spare time.

348
00:41:45,302 --> 00:41:47,460
This is a great song.

349
00:41:53,101 --> 00:41:57,597
- Would you like to dance?
- Yeah, I would.

350
00:42:15,165 --> 00:42:17,454
Are you two going steady?

351
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:20,951
No. Our families share some woods,

352
00:42:21,129 --> 00:42:24,249
so we've known each other
since we were five.

353
00:42:24,424 --> 00:42:26,500
We're thrown together a lot,

354
00:42:26,676 --> 00:42:30,425
so everybody thinks we go steady,
but they're wrong.

355
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:37,765
I know how it is. My family shares
some woods in Pennsylvania.

356
00:42:37,938 --> 00:42:40,014
With 300,000 other people.

357
00:42:43,235 --> 00:42:46,319
You must think I'm a spoiled brat.

358
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:50,482
I think you're so pretty.

359
00:42:54,871 --> 00:42:58,786
- I must sound like a real nosebleed.
- No.

360
00:42:58,959 --> 00:43:02,659
- Don't tell your roommate.
- How do you know her?

361
00:43:02,838 --> 00:43:05,922
I don't.
I just don't want her to know.

362
00:43:09,553 --> 00:43:13,301
- You're pretty, too.
- Thanks for taking care of my girl.

363
00:43:13,473 --> 00:43:15,466
Try the punch.

364
00:43:42,794 --> 00:43:44,870
Maybe he won't show.

365
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:49,045
- I'm going to puke. My stomach hurts.
- You'll be OK.

366
00:43:49,217 --> 00:43:53,001
25% of the grade!
That's crazy. That's just not right.

367
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:56,798
- I wonder who he'll call on first.
- Take a guess.

368
00:43:56,975 --> 00:44:00,011
It all comes down to this one day.
Jesus!

369
00:44:00,187 --> 00:44:04,267
- It doesn't. You're worked up.
- My mouth's all dried out.

370
00:44:04,441 --> 00:44:06,683
Shit! I can't do this!

371
00:46:12,193 --> 00:46:15,397
- That asshole Cleary!
- Sadistic shiteater!

372
00:46:15,572 --> 00:46:18,608
- Mac was doing all right.
- Will he be OK?

373
00:46:18,783 --> 00:46:24,786
- Let him alone. He'll be OK.
- Poor bastard. He really took it.

374
00:46:25,290 --> 00:46:28,042
David, your sister's on the phone.

375
00:46:29,711 --> 00:46:33,791
- Hello, Sarah, what's up?
- I didn't know you had a sister!

376
00:46:33,965 --> 00:46:36,005
- Who is this?
- Sally Wheeler.

377
00:46:36,176 --> 00:46:39,592
- Hi. Where are you?
- At school, at the dorm.

378
00:46:40,305 --> 00:46:43,140
- Are you studying?
- Yeah. Chemistry.

379
00:46:43,308 --> 00:46:45,799
- I hate Chemistry.
- Me, too.

380
00:46:47,354 --> 00:46:50,473
- You ever go to Skip's Diner?
- Skip's Diner?

381
00:46:50,648 --> 00:46:53,436
- Seen McGivern?
- Hold on... Haven't you?

382
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:56,943
Not since French class.
Where the hell is he?

383
00:46:57,113 --> 00:47:01,526
- Check with Dillon and Van Kelt.
- All right. See you later.

384
00:47:01,701 --> 00:47:05,366
- Hi... Skip's Diner?
- Yeah, it's in town.

385
00:47:05,538 --> 00:47:07,578
Kind of a hang-out.

386
00:47:07,749 --> 00:47:12,210
I thought if you weren't doing
anything tomorrow, we could go.

387
00:47:12,379 --> 00:47:15,166
- What time?
- Ten o'clock?

388
00:47:29,229 --> 00:47:33,689
He hasn't shown up.
I'm going to go look for him.

389
00:48:03,972 --> 00:48:06,048
<i>Lights out!</i>

390
00:48:24,659 --> 00:48:28,075
McGivern! Mac!
Come on, Mac, buddy! Where are you?

391
00:48:28,246 --> 00:48:30,322
Mac!

392
00:48:52,604 --> 00:48:55,937
- Hold on, I'll get the lights.
- McGivern?

393
00:48:59,402 --> 00:49:01,311
Mac?

394
00:49:05,158 --> 00:49:07,993
- McGiv!
- Mac!

395
00:49:43,029 --> 00:49:45,520
- Let's tell somebody.
- Maybe he's drunk.

396
00:49:45,698 --> 00:49:48,865
- Mac never drinks.
- Do you think he went home?

397
00:49:49,035 --> 00:49:53,247
- He would have said something.
- Isn't that French class?

398
00:49:56,501 --> 00:49:58,493
Come on, let's go.

399
00:50:11,057 --> 00:50:13,180
- Mac!
- McGiv?

400
00:50:17,230 --> 00:50:19,899
Come on. Hey!

401
00:50:21,484 --> 00:50:23,892
Hey! Get some help.

402
00:50:44,382 --> 00:50:46,707
Shh... Shh... It's OK.

403
00:50:48,803 --> 00:50:53,132
Gentlemen, please! Please, gentlemen,
go back to bed. Please.

404
00:50:58,521 --> 00:51:02,104
You did this!
You did this!

405
00:51:02,275 --> 00:51:04,351
You rode him until he broke!

406
00:51:04,527 --> 00:51:08,062
David, walk away!
Just walk away!

407
00:51:08,239 --> 00:51:11,822
You wouldn't let up, would you?
You did this!

408
00:51:11,993 --> 00:51:15,741
- Come on!
- I'll get you, Cleary! All right?

409
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:21,247
That was horrible.

410
00:51:21,419 --> 00:51:25,369
But David, you can't
go after a teacher like that here.

411
00:51:25,548 --> 00:51:27,790
It's the end if you do.

412
00:51:28,551 --> 00:51:31,754
My friends back home
wouldn't believe this.

413
00:51:31,929 --> 00:51:34,337
Over a failing grade in French!

414
00:51:34,515 --> 00:51:39,224
Good grades. The right schools,
colleges, connections.

415
00:51:39,395 --> 00:51:42,147
Those are the keys to the kingdom.

416
00:51:42,315 --> 00:51:45,316
None of us goes off
and lives by his wits.

417
00:51:45,485 --> 00:51:49,482
We do what they tell us
and they give us the good life.

418
00:51:50,073 --> 00:51:52,742
Goddamn hope we like it
when we get it!

419
00:51:52,909 --> 00:51:58,116
- What will happen to Mac?
- He's not coming back.

420
00:52:01,834 --> 00:52:05,168
Man!
I've heard of nervous breakdowns,

421
00:52:05,338 --> 00:52:10,249
but I always thought it happened
to women who were 40 years old.

422
00:52:10,426 --> 00:52:12,917
Not to a kid my age.

423
00:52:13,096 --> 00:52:19,050
When I was a sophomore,
there was this senior, William Whitton.

424
00:52:19,227 --> 00:52:22,809
- He hung himself in the gym.
- Why?

425
00:52:24,273 --> 00:52:27,144
- He didn't get into Harvard.
- Shit!

426
00:52:27,318 --> 00:52:29,809
- Yeah.
- I want to go to Harvard.

427
00:52:29,987 --> 00:52:33,736
I'll be goddamned
if I croak myself if I don't.

428
00:52:35,410 --> 00:52:37,533
I envy you.

429
00:52:39,706 --> 00:52:41,828
Me? Why?

430
00:52:44,127 --> 00:52:47,875
Because if you get what you want,
you'll deserve it.

431
00:52:48,047 --> 00:52:50,834
And if you don't, you'll manage.

432
00:52:52,009 --> 00:52:56,588
You don't have to live up
to anybody else's expectations.

433
00:52:57,348 --> 00:53:01,049
That's what draws people,
not that you're quarterback.

434
00:53:01,227 --> 00:53:04,430
You're the most popular guy
on campus.

435
00:53:05,398 --> 00:53:09,348
If my name weren't Dillon,
it would be different.

436
00:53:10,027 --> 00:53:14,357
- Bullshit.
- David, don't forget my name's Dillon.

437
00:53:15,074 --> 00:53:17,696
Son of Grayson Jr,
brother of Grayson III.

438
00:53:17,869 --> 00:53:21,238
I'm a Dillon,
a part of those right connections.

439
00:53:21,414 --> 00:53:24,119
People don't care about that.

440
00:53:25,126 --> 00:53:27,202
You'll see.

441
00:54:29,649 --> 00:54:31,725
Evening, sir.

442
00:54:45,206 --> 00:54:46,997
Evening, sir.

443
00:56:03,993 --> 00:56:07,741
- You don't smoke?
- No, I tried it, but it didn't take.

444
00:56:09,290 --> 00:56:12,825
You're too good.
Is that to impress the mothers?

445
00:56:13,002 --> 00:56:16,585
- What mothers?
- Of all your girlfriends.

446
00:56:16,756 --> 00:56:19,710
No, too many to try.

447
00:56:21,302 --> 00:56:24,172
We were talking
about Saturdays in Scranton.

448
00:56:24,555 --> 00:56:26,631
Oh, yeah. Garbage day.

449
00:56:26,807 --> 00:56:29,512
We had to haul our trash
to the dump.

450
00:56:31,062 --> 00:56:33,138
Don't knock it.

451
00:56:33,314 --> 00:56:36,101
One day, my father and I
see two guys.

452
00:56:36,275 --> 00:56:39,525
One of them's got
a rope around his waist

453
00:56:39,695 --> 00:56:43,029
and his buddy is lowering him
into the pit.

454
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:47,197
- What for?
- They were scavenging for tin cans.

455
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:50,205
- Who'd do that?
- That's what I said.

456
00:56:50,665 --> 00:56:53,831
And my dad gave me
this long, hard look

457
00:56:54,001 --> 00:56:57,584
and he said,
"Davey, it's an honest living."

458
00:57:01,258 --> 00:57:03,334
I never forgot that.

459
00:57:06,430 --> 00:57:10,131
- You're different from the other boys.
- How?

460
00:57:10,309 --> 00:57:15,849
The others, like Dillon, you know
everything about them in two minutes.

461
00:57:16,023 --> 00:57:18,894
- But you...
- Four minutes, easy.

462
00:57:22,071 --> 00:57:24,527
You have a serious side.

463
00:57:29,996 --> 00:57:32,949
Let's go. Move it.
Move it, move it!

464
00:57:33,124 --> 00:57:35,959
- Wait.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

465
00:57:36,293 --> 00:57:38,535
- Night, David.
- Can I call you?

466
00:57:38,713 --> 00:57:40,789
You'd better!

467
00:58:02,653 --> 00:58:07,445
- We'll finish off St Luke's.
- I'll drink to that. It's about time.

468
00:58:07,616 --> 00:58:12,492
Don't inspire me to increase my bet.
You can't beat St Luke's.

469
00:58:12,663 --> 00:58:17,124
This year is different.
You haven't seen our secret weapon.

470
00:58:17,293 --> 00:58:22,085
Hey, hello, hello!
Mom, Dad, Gray, this is David Greene.

471
00:58:22,256 --> 00:58:24,581
How do you do?
Pleased to meet you.

472
00:58:24,759 --> 00:58:26,917
Mr and Mrs Wheeler.
David Greene.

473
00:58:27,094 --> 00:58:29,716
- Pleased to meet you.
- You've met Sally.

474
00:58:29,889 --> 00:58:31,846
- Hello, Sally.
- Hi.

475
00:58:32,016 --> 00:58:35,883
- Are we going to punish St Luke's?
- Severely, sir.

476
00:58:37,021 --> 00:58:40,604
- Stop eating! You'll be playing soon.
- I'm hungry.

477
00:58:40,775 --> 00:58:45,602
- Poor Wheeler attended St Luke's.
- Your winning streak's over.

478
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:48,187
- Not today.
- Join us for dinner?

479
00:58:48,365 --> 00:58:51,485
- Sure. Thank you.
- Remember, loser pays.

480
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:53,736
All right, you're on.

481
00:58:53,913 --> 00:58:57,578
- We should get back.
- Yeah. See you later.

482
00:58:57,750 --> 00:59:01,368
- Bye-bye.
- Nice to meet you.

483
00:59:03,297 --> 00:59:05,835
- He's very cute.
- Yeah.

484
00:59:06,008 --> 00:59:08,416
No, really, who found the boy?

485
00:59:08,594 --> 00:59:11,595
He applied.
Just like anybody else.

486
00:59:22,817 --> 00:59:24,893
<i>In the black Thunderbird,</i>

487
00:59:25,069 --> 00:59:30,360
<i>St Matthew's oldest living alumnus,</i>
<i>Franklin Benson, class of 1875.</i>

492
00:59:49,176 --> 00:59:53,969
<i>This year's inductees are,</i>

493
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:57,057
<i>the youngest member</i>

<i>quarterback Grayson Dillon III.</i>

495
01:00:05,276 --> 01:00:07,352
I don't believe it!

496
01:00:10,906 --> 01:00:16,695
<i>Grayson is currently attending Harvard</i>
<i>and plays football for the Crimson.</i>

497
01:00:32,511 --> 01:00:36,176
<i>St Matt's ball,</i>
<i>second and twelve on their own ten.</i>

498
01:00:37,933 --> 01:00:39,593
Set! One!

499
01:00:43,772 --> 01:00:49,727
Chesty, fake off tackle right.
Pass to the flat. Left to Reece, go!

500
01:00:50,905 --> 01:00:53,609
Hey David,
they're looking for a pass.

501
01:00:53,782 --> 01:00:57,365
Give it to me on the right side.
I can get the first down.

502
01:00:57,536 --> 01:01:00,371
- Come on, my father's here.
- All right.

503
01:01:00,539 --> 01:01:03,030
David, fake over tackle right.

504
01:01:03,584 --> 01:01:08,127
Left formation, Dillon takes it,
right draw. On two. Ready?

505
01:01:17,264 --> 01:01:19,340
One! Two! Three!

506
01:01:30,027 --> 01:01:31,936
Oh, yeah! Show them!

507
01:01:32,279 --> 01:01:33,857
Fumble!

508
01:01:34,073 --> 01:01:36,149
<i>St Matt's fumbles.</i>

509
01:01:36,325 --> 01:01:38,401
What the hell's going on?

510
01:01:38,577 --> 01:01:42,077
I send in a play,
that's the play I want to see.

511
01:01:42,248 --> 01:01:45,332
- I'm the coach. You got that?
- Yeah, got it.

512
01:01:45,501 --> 01:01:47,956
Go out and bring this game home.

513
01:01:48,128 --> 01:01:51,213
<i>St Luke's ball, third and goal.</i>

514
01:01:53,342 --> 01:01:55,002
Blue! Set!

515
01:01:55,636 --> 01:01:57,593
Hut! Hut!

516
01:02:02,393 --> 01:02:04,884
<i>Touchdown St Luke's.</i>

517
01:02:08,148 --> 01:02:10,224
Damn it, Dillon!

518
01:02:12,486 --> 01:02:16,947
<i>St Matt's ball, third and five</i>
<i>on St Luke's thirty-yard line.</i>

519
01:02:17,241 --> 01:02:18,901
Down!

520
01:02:19,159 --> 01:02:20,819
Set!

521
01:02:21,578 --> 01:02:23,238
One!

522
01:02:25,249 --> 01:02:27,040

523
01:02:27,209 --> 01:02:28,834
Go! Go!

524
01:02:36,385 --> 01:02:39,801
<i>It's good!</i>
<i>St Matthew's is on the scoreboard.</i>

525
01:02:50,941 --> 01:02:54,559
Give me another chance.
I know I can get six yards.

526
01:02:54,737 --> 01:02:59,695
- Let me make up for that fumble.
- Coach calls the plays.

527
01:02:59,867 --> 01:03:04,327
We're going to win now! Left draw,
quarterback keep left on two.

528
01:03:04,496 --> 01:03:07,746
Dillon, you'd better
block your ass off for me.

529
01:03:13,797 --> 01:03:15,837
One! Two!

530
01:03:49,750 --> 01:03:51,956
Yeah! Yeah!

531
01:04:06,517 --> 01:04:09,933
Let's have dessert,
since dinner is on Mr Wheeler.

532
01:04:11,313 --> 01:04:14,184
I consider it a moral victory.

533
01:04:14,358 --> 01:04:18,438
There is no column in the record books
for moral victories.

534
01:04:19,780 --> 01:04:22,781
- How do you like our club?
- Unbelievable.

535
01:04:22,950 --> 01:04:27,493
In Scranton, a club is three guys
who chipped in to buy an old Buick.

536
01:04:29,456 --> 01:04:33,501
Good arm, good sense of humour.
Not a bad combination.

537
01:04:34,169 --> 01:04:37,953
- Hello, Grayson.
- Oh, Tom Keating. How are you?

538
01:04:38,132 --> 01:04:41,298
- See the game?
- Wouldn't have missed it.

539
01:04:41,468 --> 01:04:44,754
- The new quarterback's our hope.
- Meet him.

540
01:04:44,930 --> 01:04:48,097
David Greene,
this is Mr Keating, a trustee.

541
01:04:48,267 --> 01:04:51,885
Son, many thanks.
It's good to be a winner again.

542
01:04:52,062 --> 01:04:55,016
- You know the Wheelers?
- Oh, yes.

543
01:04:55,190 --> 01:04:59,235
- Nice to see you, Tom.
- And my boys, Gray and Charlie.

544
01:04:59,570 --> 01:05:01,646
Of course. Gray...

545
01:05:03,073 --> 01:05:06,240
- Congratulations. Quite an honour.
- Thank you.

546
01:05:06,410 --> 01:05:11,036
- Call me in the city, Tom.
- I will, Grayson. Have a nice evening.

547
01:05:11,206 --> 01:05:15,334
I'd like to introduce you to someone.
Do you mind?

548
01:05:20,215 --> 01:05:24,961
- Tom Keating has had a drink or two.
- He does have that problem.

549
01:05:25,804 --> 01:05:29,054
Excuse me, I see Mrs Bartram
left unattended.

550
01:05:30,017 --> 01:05:32,093
Please, don't get up.

551
01:05:36,356 --> 01:05:38,432
How about a dance?

552
01:05:38,609 --> 01:05:41,812
If one of these young men
will dance with Sally.

553
01:05:41,987 --> 01:05:44,525
Mother!

554
01:05:47,826 --> 01:05:51,527
David, do you mind?
I'd like to have a word with this guy.

555
01:05:53,207 --> 01:05:56,243
- Would you like to dance?
- Sure.

556
01:05:57,085 --> 01:05:59,327
OK.

557
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:10,265
- Son, you played a good game today.
- Not as good as some people.

558
01:06:11,016 --> 01:06:14,599
Don't sell yourself short.
That was a key block.

559
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:17,605
Without it,
David couldn't have scored.

560
01:06:18,398 --> 01:06:20,474
Fine game, wasn't it?

561
01:06:38,961 --> 01:06:41,037
- I have a secret.
- Oh?

562
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:44,881
I think about you.
More than I ought to.

563
01:06:45,050 --> 01:06:47,043
That's too bad.

564
01:06:47,219 --> 01:06:50,635
Because if you think of me
as much as I think of you,

565
01:06:50,806 --> 01:06:54,009
we're both going to flunk
right out of school.

566
01:06:54,184 --> 01:06:57,102
Am I all sweaty
and red in the face?

567
01:06:58,897 --> 01:07:01,056
You look like an angel.

568
01:07:09,241 --> 01:07:13,191
Don't let your brother's award
detract from your day.

569
01:07:13,370 --> 01:07:18,198
Of course not. I threw a good block,
he got into the Hall of Fame.

570
01:07:18,375 --> 01:07:20,783
People have different abilities.

571
01:07:20,961 --> 01:07:23,203
I should accept my mediocrity.

572
01:07:23,380 --> 01:07:28,006
You are not mediocre. You wouldn't
be at St Matt's if you were.

573
01:07:34,558 --> 01:07:38,508
- What are you looking at?
- Dillon looks like he's dying.

574
01:07:38,687 --> 01:07:42,554
Mention him once more,
I will sit down in a huff.

575
01:07:42,733 --> 01:07:44,809
You know I'm a spoiled brat!

576
01:07:44,985 --> 01:07:48,318
Dillon, Dillon, Dillon.
Charlie, Charlie, Charlie.

577
01:07:48,488 --> 01:07:52,356
You beat St Luke's.
Nobody thought you had a chance.

578
01:07:52,534 --> 01:07:56,069
- Enjoy it!
- Fine. I'm enjoying it. Can I go now?

579
01:07:56,246 --> 01:07:58,571
Yes, yes, you can go.

580
01:08:11,261 --> 01:08:16,219
- Thanks for taking care of my girl.
- Stop saying that! I'm not your girl.

581
01:08:16,391 --> 01:08:20,341
- What the hell is this?
- You don't listen very well, do you?

582
01:08:22,064 --> 01:08:26,856
Sally, you're embarrassing me
in front of my friend. Let's talk.

583
01:08:27,027 --> 01:08:30,859
No, you're embarrassing me
in front of my friend.

584
01:08:31,073 --> 01:08:35,070
Charlie, I'm sorry.
It just kind of happened.

585
01:08:36,662 --> 01:08:40,196
- Screw you, friend.
- Charlie, come on!

586
01:08:40,374 --> 01:08:42,865
No! Let him go. I know him.

587
01:08:43,043 --> 01:08:46,827
He needs time to cool off.
I'll speak to him later.

588
01:08:50,175 --> 01:08:52,381
The victors! Where's your friend?

589
01:08:52,552 --> 01:08:55,470
- What friend? Do I get a drink?
- Absolutely.

590
01:08:55,639 --> 01:08:58,344
- Scotch and soda.
- Dewar's and soda.

591
01:08:58,517 --> 01:09:03,475
- You met Cal Reynolds, class of '35?
- Hi, Charlie. Congratulations.

592
01:09:03,647 --> 01:09:08,024
St Luke's class of '35. That's why
he looks so down in the mouth.

593
01:09:08,193 --> 01:09:10,482
I wish we had found Greene first.

594
01:09:10,654 --> 01:09:15,232
- St Luke's wouldn't have taken him.
- No, probably not.

595
01:09:15,409 --> 01:09:18,659
- Why not?
- They wouldn't have enrolled a Jew.

596
01:09:18,829 --> 01:09:21,320
Not even for a championship.

597
01:09:23,250 --> 01:09:25,326
A Jew?

598
01:09:32,092 --> 01:09:34,168
Holy shit!

599
01:09:34,428 --> 01:09:39,173
Reynolds, have I ever told you
how nicely you keep a secret?

600
01:09:40,684 --> 01:09:42,760
Sorry.

601
01:10:15,510 --> 01:10:19,175
- I can't believe I dropped that pass.
- Neither can I.

602
01:10:19,347 --> 01:10:21,423
- Punish me.
- Suffer!

603
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:24,091
Forget it, Rip! We won.

604
01:10:26,354 --> 01:10:28,430
We won!

605
01:10:30,192 --> 01:10:32,861
Hey, Dillon. What a block, boy!

606
01:10:33,028 --> 01:10:36,112
- I taught him all he knows.
- God save me!

607
01:10:36,281 --> 01:10:40,493
- You did play a great game, Dillon.
- Well, we beat St Luke's.

608
01:10:41,369 --> 01:10:44,620
That was the grand plan.
Mission accomplished.

609
01:10:44,790 --> 01:10:48,241
The old boy network
bought us a victory.

610
01:10:48,418 --> 01:10:49,912
But...

611
01:10:51,213 --> 01:10:53,419
The joke is on us.

612
01:10:54,007 --> 01:10:56,083
What joke?

613
01:10:56,468 --> 01:11:00,382
- You didn't hear the joke?
- All right. Let's hear it.

614
01:11:00,555 --> 01:11:05,264
True story. Last weekend,
there was a religious revival meeting.

615
01:11:05,435 --> 01:11:08,471
Bishop Sheen
gave such a stirring address

616
01:11:08,647 --> 01:11:11,932
that 10,000 people
converted to Catholicism.

617
01:11:12,317 --> 01:11:17,442
Then Billy Graham got up and,
after an hour of inspired preaching,

618
01:11:17,614 --> 01:11:20,900
10,000 people
converted to Protestantism.

619
01:11:21,076 --> 01:11:24,575
Finally, to end the programme,
Pat Boone got up

620
01:11:24,788 --> 01:11:27,991
and sang
<i>There's a Gold Mine in the Sky</i>

621
01:11:28,166 --> 01:11:30,918
and 20,000 Jews
joined the Air Force.

622
01:11:34,089 --> 01:11:38,549
What's the matter, David?
Don't Jews have a sense of humour?

623
01:11:44,850 --> 01:11:47,471
It turns out our golden boy here

624
01:11:47,644 --> 01:11:50,135
is a lying, back-stabbing kike.

625
01:11:53,775 --> 01:11:56,266
- Kike!
- You son of a bitch!

626
01:11:57,821 --> 01:11:59,778
Get the door.

627
01:11:59,948 --> 01:12:03,198
- Come on, damn it!
- I don't want to fight him!

628
01:12:03,368 --> 01:12:06,452
Come on!
Go ahead! Deny it!

629
01:12:06,621 --> 01:12:08,744
- Deny it!
- I don't want to fight him!

630
01:12:09,082 --> 01:12:12,000
It's true! It's true!
He's a heeb.

631
01:12:17,924 --> 01:12:20,000
Come on, stop it!

632
01:12:20,176 --> 01:12:22,299
All right, enough! Come on!

633
01:12:27,350 --> 01:12:29,639
No.

634
01:13:04,638 --> 01:13:08,338
You going to keep your face in a book
all year?

635
01:13:08,516 --> 01:13:13,178
- What do you expect me to say?
- That it's no big deal.

636
01:13:13,355 --> 01:13:17,815
If it's no big deal, why didn't you
tell me in the first place?

637
01:13:18,401 --> 01:13:22,351
- I'm your roommate.
- You never told me your religion.

638
01:13:23,615 --> 01:13:25,857
- Methodist.
- Methodist.

639
01:13:26,743 --> 01:13:30,278
- And all the time I didn't know.
- That's different.

640
01:13:30,455 --> 01:13:36,042
- Really? How is it different?
- It just is. Jews are different.

641
01:13:37,921 --> 01:13:41,456
It's not like between
Methodists and Lutherans.

642
01:13:41,633 --> 01:13:45,713
I mean, Jews,
everything about them is different.

643
01:13:47,097 --> 01:13:50,181
OK, let's get it out.
You think Jews are dirt.

644
01:13:50,642 --> 01:13:53,927
- Come on, David!
- If you think like them, admit it!

645
01:13:54,104 --> 01:13:58,101
- Say it. Jews are greedy...
- Come off it! Come on!

646
01:14:00,568 --> 01:14:02,027
Come on, I...

647
01:14:04,906 --> 01:14:09,153
You know the first day I came here,
I thought I was dreaming.

648
01:14:09,327 --> 01:14:14,369
I knew it was only for a year,
but I thought, man, what a year!

649
01:14:14,541 --> 01:14:16,617
I'd get into Harvard.

650
01:14:16,793 --> 01:14:20,791
It's not easy when you come
from Podunk Public High School.

651
01:14:20,964 --> 01:14:23,253
You guys were my friends.

652
01:14:25,593 --> 01:14:29,638
We were winning games.
I met Sally.

653
01:14:30,890 --> 01:14:37,178
I didn't want to be told I couldn't
be part of it because I was a Jew.

654
01:14:37,355 --> 01:14:42,183
Can you understand that?
It's happened before.

655
01:14:43,695 --> 01:14:48,273
You could have told us.
It wouldn't have made a difference.

656
01:14:48,450 --> 01:14:51,486
Sure.
I knew that the first night I got here

657
01:14:51,661 --> 01:14:56,038
when I heard how McGivern
got his hi-fi. He "jewed him down".

658
01:14:56,207 --> 01:14:58,283
Remember?

659
01:15:00,503 --> 01:15:04,252
Sure.
It wouldn't have made a difference.

660
01:15:18,646 --> 01:15:20,722
One moment, please!

661
01:15:20,899 --> 01:15:24,433
I've graded
your take-home translations.

662
01:15:24,736 --> 01:15:27,025
They weren't all that bad.

663
01:15:27,405 --> 01:15:31,485
Connors, especially,
wrote a near flawless translation.

664
01:15:34,370 --> 01:15:38,154
I noticed, Mr Connors,
like the rest of the class,

665
01:15:38,333 --> 01:15:42,081
you signed the Honour Code agreement.

666
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:47,581
- Yeah?
- This indicates a promise not to cheat.

667
01:15:47,759 --> 01:15:49,419
Yeah.

668
01:15:49,594 --> 01:15:53,212
Use of a published translation
would be cheating.

669
01:15:53,389 --> 01:15:57,434
I didn't use anything
except a dictionary.

670
01:15:57,602 --> 01:16:00,722
If you say so.
Your translation, however,

671
01:16:00,897 --> 01:16:04,681
was a quantum leap
over your previous efforts.

672
01:16:06,361 --> 01:16:10,690
Maybe it's because
you're such a great teacher, sir.

673
01:16:13,952 --> 01:16:16,277
Pick up your graded papers.

674
01:16:36,808 --> 01:16:39,844
Dillon. Dillon! Here he comes.

675
01:16:40,019 --> 01:16:42,261
- A Jew!
- Grow up!

676
01:16:42,438 --> 01:16:44,764
Oh, Reece, you're so mature.

677
01:16:46,776 --> 01:16:51,771
Excuse me, there's no salt
on this table. I need salt for my fruit.

678
01:16:51,948 --> 01:16:56,989
- Someone's not doing his menial job.
- It's so hard to find decent help!

679
01:16:58,413 --> 01:17:02,991
- Can't you move any faster?
- I'll show you how fast I can move!

680
01:17:03,168 --> 01:17:05,456
David! David!

681
01:17:05,628 --> 01:17:08,166
David, come on! It's not worth it.

682
01:17:08,339 --> 01:17:10,415
It's not worth it, all right?

683
01:17:14,846 --> 01:17:19,009
My name is Richard Collins.
What's yours? Reeceberg?

684
01:17:20,435 --> 01:17:24,053
David!
I'll work your table, you take mine.

685
01:17:24,230 --> 01:17:26,900
You need this job as much as I do.

686
01:17:27,066 --> 01:17:30,186
Come on, Greene, don't blow it,
all right?

687
01:17:31,279 --> 01:17:33,272
All right.

688
01:17:38,203 --> 01:17:43,624
I'm open. Pass it up!
McGoo, pass it up!

689
01:18:36,594 --> 01:18:38,468
<i>Lights out!</i>

690
01:19:10,336 --> 01:19:12,412
Cowards!

691
01:19:26,227 --> 01:19:27,887
OK, Elsie...

692
01:19:28,688 --> 01:19:31,309
Keep kicking! Good girl!

693
01:19:31,482 --> 01:19:34,436
Kick harder!
Reach forwards, that's it!

694
01:19:39,866 --> 01:19:42,321
Elsie, nice going.

695
01:19:42,535 --> 01:19:47,078
Betsy, keep pulling.
Nice going, Anne Marie. Great!

696
01:19:51,461 --> 01:19:55,921
- May I help you?
- Yes, I have to talk to Sally Wheeler.

697
01:19:57,550 --> 01:20:00,670
Sally, you have a visitor.

698
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:16,891
- What?
- You wouldn't talk on the phone.

699
01:20:17,070 --> 01:20:20,652
- Sally, take this outside.
- Yes, Miss Jones.

700
01:20:29,248 --> 01:20:34,409
- Did you have to come here?
- I had to hear it from you.

701
01:20:34,587 --> 01:20:38,336
You have no idea
what you've put me through.

702
01:20:38,508 --> 01:20:42,755
- My mother is going on and on.
- You could have said on the phone.

703
01:20:42,929 --> 01:20:47,341
My friends,
they just keep pestering me.

704
01:20:47,517 --> 01:20:51,016
They say, "What's
it like to kiss a Jew? Does his..."

705
01:20:51,979 --> 01:20:54,055
Go on.

706
01:20:58,403 --> 01:21:02,447
- "Does his nose get in the way?"
- Nice friends.

707
01:21:06,327 --> 01:21:08,569
At least they're honest.

708
01:21:08,746 --> 01:21:13,373
All that stuff about Scranton,
you didn't say the important thing.

709
01:21:13,543 --> 01:21:15,619
That's not right, David.

710
01:21:15,795 --> 01:21:22,047
I was afraid you wouldn't want
to be with me. Would you?

711
01:21:26,931 --> 01:21:30,382
Don't look at me that way.

712
01:21:31,269 --> 01:21:33,345
This may be a surprise,

713
01:21:33,521 --> 01:21:38,397
but you're not the first Jew I've met,
just the first who denied it.

714
01:21:40,027 --> 01:21:42,316
I'm the same guy, Sally.

715
01:21:50,997 --> 01:21:53,073
I know.

716
01:21:58,588 --> 01:22:01,505
No, I'm sorry.
It just can't happen.

717
01:22:02,049 --> 01:22:05,549
No, it can't happen.
Just... Not now.

718
01:22:07,221 --> 01:22:10,139
- You lied to me.
- I didn't lie to you!

719
01:22:10,308 --> 01:22:13,890
I lied to my father.
I lied to myself.

720
01:22:26,115 --> 01:22:28,820
I have to get back to practice.

721
01:22:32,705 --> 01:22:34,781
Go ahead.

722
01:23:21,212 --> 01:23:23,288
- Test Act?
- 1685.

723
01:23:23,464 --> 01:23:26,915
1686.
Jack, suspend Protestant bishops?

724
01:23:27,093 --> 01:23:30,212
- What?
- Suspend Protestant bishops?

725
01:23:31,556 --> 01:23:34,011
- 1606.
- McGoo, Declaration...

726
01:23:47,154 --> 01:23:50,773
I either know this stuff now
or I'll never know it.

727
01:23:50,950 --> 01:23:52,989
Sack time.

728
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:05,494
Are you sure your notes are right?

729
01:24:05,673 --> 01:24:09,457
Yeah. Now all I have to do
is remember them.

730
01:25:00,186 --> 01:25:03,519
Please reaffirm your Honour Code.

731
01:25:07,318 --> 01:25:10,734
This test will comprise
30% of your final grade.

732
01:25:12,531 --> 01:25:14,607
You may begin.

733
01:25:55,116 --> 01:25:57,404
Oh, shit!

734
01:25:58,077 --> 01:26:00,153
Bless you!

735
01:26:37,366 --> 01:26:40,901
Time is up, gentlemen.
Papers to the front.

736
01:26:46,876 --> 01:26:49,711
Well, that wasn't so hard,
was it?

737
01:26:50,588 --> 01:26:55,795
My, my, Mr Connors. You usually
don't have this much to communicate.

738
01:26:57,553 --> 01:27:02,131
You were bound to ask
the right questions sooner or later, sir.

739
01:27:03,601 --> 01:27:05,677
Dismissed, gentlemen.

740
01:27:09,064 --> 01:27:12,480
What's with Rip?
He must have gone down in flames.

741
01:27:12,651 --> 01:27:16,186
- Sure, and I guess you aced it?
- Naturally.

742
01:27:17,990 --> 01:27:22,901
You're dead! You are dead!
You are a fink! Connors, you jerk!

743
01:28:06,121 --> 01:28:08,197
Be seated, gentlemen.

744
01:28:16,674 --> 01:28:21,252
I regret to announce that
someone cheated on yesterday's exam.

745
01:28:22,638 --> 01:28:24,963
Everyone signed the Honour Code.

746
01:28:25,140 --> 01:28:29,352
So we have a rather bleak situation
confronting us.

747
01:28:31,313 --> 01:28:35,393
Today is Saturday.
Your next class is on Monday.

748
01:28:36,527 --> 01:28:41,485
If the cheater does not come forward,
or is not identified by then,

749
01:28:41,657 --> 01:28:45,406
I will be forced to fail
the entire section.

750
01:28:46,120 --> 01:28:48,362
Need I remind you what that means?

751
01:28:48,539 --> 01:28:51,575
Isn't that unfair?
Only one of us cheated.

752
01:28:51,750 --> 01:28:54,870
We have all been dishonoured
by this person.

753
01:28:55,337 --> 01:28:58,837
How can you be sure
that someone cheated, sir?

754
01:29:00,259 --> 01:29:04,553
I prefer to keep the evidence to myself
for the time being.

755
01:29:05,514 --> 01:29:09,132
- Can't you give us another test, sir?
- That's fair.

756
01:29:09,310 --> 01:29:13,473
And pretend no one cheated?
But someone did cheat.

757
01:29:14,315 --> 01:29:18,063
Whoever has done this
has robbed you of your honour.

758
01:29:18,235 --> 01:29:22,696
If I ignore it, he will have robbed me
of mine, as well.

759
01:29:25,659 --> 01:29:28,613
I leave it in your hands, gentlemen.

760
01:29:47,848 --> 01:29:52,759
- Someone had better answer quick.
- Someone must have seen something.

761
01:29:52,937 --> 01:29:55,474
Yeah, and then what do we do?

762
01:29:55,648 --> 01:30:00,559
I work my ass off for four years and
now one lying bastard ruins my life!

763
01:30:00,736 --> 01:30:04,152
- Take it easy.
- Whoever did this, admit to it!

764
01:30:04,323 --> 01:30:09,364
- You can't let him fail the whole class.
- You still have time.

765
01:30:09,536 --> 01:30:14,531
I've got this appalling feeling.
I have a good idea who did it.

766
01:30:14,708 --> 01:30:16,452
Who?

767
01:30:16,627 --> 01:30:18,916
- Connors.
- You like having teeth?

768
01:30:19,088 --> 01:30:22,005
Cleary all but accused you in French.

769
01:30:22,174 --> 01:30:26,172
Cleary is a sick shit
and so are you, you four-eyed runt!

770
01:30:28,472 --> 01:30:33,348
I've been in more trouble
than all of you and I always admit to it.

771
01:30:33,519 --> 01:30:36,888
- So admit to this.
- Come here, you little runt!

772
01:30:37,564 --> 01:30:39,723
Come on! Come on, Jack!

773
01:30:44,113 --> 01:30:47,114
You bastards aren't pinning this
on me.

774
01:30:53,372 --> 01:30:55,945
Fine. Just fine.
Very cool, McGoo.

775
01:30:56,125 --> 01:30:59,291
I'm sorry,
but this could ruin all our lives.

776
01:30:59,837 --> 01:31:02,375
Look, we've got three prefects here.

777
01:31:02,548 --> 01:31:04,790
You guys have got to handle this.

778
01:31:04,967 --> 01:31:09,759
Let's sleep on it and meet tomorrow
after Chapel in the Founders' Room.

779
01:31:09,930 --> 01:31:12,338
Whoever's guilty, think it over.

780
01:31:13,350 --> 01:31:17,514
- Dillon, we have to talk.
- We've got nothing to talk about.

781
01:31:17,688 --> 01:31:20,855
I know it was you.
I can describe the crib sheet.

782
01:31:21,442 --> 01:31:26,068
That's Gierasch's evidence.
Have you seen it since you used it?

783
01:31:26,238 --> 01:31:30,485
If you saw me and didn't report it,
you'd be in violation, too.

784
01:31:30,659 --> 01:31:33,695
I know.
But I can't let the whole class fail.

785
01:31:33,871 --> 01:31:38,948
- He's bluffing. He won't fail anybody.
- Gierasch wouldn't bluff.

786
01:31:39,126 --> 01:31:42,744
David, you don't understand
the way it is.

787
01:31:42,921 --> 01:31:46,041
You don't know what
this can do to you.

788
01:31:46,216 --> 01:31:49,835
My family expects me to measure up
to the impossible.

789
01:31:50,012 --> 01:31:53,712
- I try, but I can't.
- Set it straight, Dillon.

790
01:31:53,891 --> 01:31:55,967
- David, David!
- What?

791
01:31:56,143 --> 01:32:00,093
Look... I'm begging you.

792
01:32:02,066 --> 01:32:05,731
I'm sorry. I was a prejudiced prick.
I know.

793
01:32:05,903 --> 01:32:09,735
It's nothing to do with that.
Just confess.

794
01:32:12,367 --> 01:32:14,194
All right!

795
01:32:14,620 --> 01:32:19,163
Nothing for nothing, right?
How much is it going to cost?

796
01:32:19,333 --> 01:32:22,203
Either you tell them or I'll tell them.

797
01:32:22,503 --> 01:32:25,587
Son of a bitch!
Stay where you belong!

798
01:32:28,258 --> 01:32:33,086
All I want to know is how many of
you guys think I could have done it?

799
01:32:33,263 --> 01:32:36,300
- You did screw up some assignments.
- So?

800
01:32:36,475 --> 01:32:40,389
- What are you pulling? C?
- What about this French test?

801
01:32:40,562 --> 01:32:44,263
- Cleary says he cheated.
- Why wouldn't he cheat again?

802
01:32:44,441 --> 01:32:48,854
- I told you I didn't cheat.
- How can we believe you?

803
01:32:49,029 --> 01:32:51,983
- Maybe we should...
- All right. Lay off.

804
01:32:52,157 --> 01:32:54,648
It wasn't Connors.

805
01:32:57,162 --> 01:32:59,534
This isn't easy for me to say.

806
01:32:59,706 --> 01:33:03,751
I know it's going to disappoint
some of you and I'm sorry.

807
01:33:03,919 --> 01:33:06,125
I should have said yesterday.

808
01:33:06,296 --> 01:33:09,333
- I know who cheated.
- Who?

809
01:33:10,759 --> 01:33:13,333
- It was Greene.
- What?

810
01:33:13,512 --> 01:33:17,296
- Yeah, I saw him.
- You're a liar! I saw him cheat.

811
01:33:17,474 --> 01:33:21,472
- Just admit it.
- I gave him the choice of confessing.

812
01:33:21,645 --> 01:33:23,519
Hey! Hey!

813
01:33:24,523 --> 01:33:28,568
I saw you cheat!
Word of Honour I saw him cheat.

814
01:33:28,735 --> 01:33:30,942
Let's tell Gierasch the situation.

815
01:33:31,113 --> 01:33:33,651
What?
I turned him in and he's denying it.

816
01:33:33,824 --> 01:33:37,738
- Tell Gierasch!
- We have to make the decision here.

817
01:33:37,911 --> 01:33:40,616
Would you both trust us to be fair?

818
01:33:40,789 --> 01:33:44,075
- Of course I do.
- Greene? Do you trust us?

819
01:33:44,251 --> 01:33:46,956
- Why should he?
- Why shouldn't he?

820
01:33:47,129 --> 01:33:49,418
Unless he's hiding something.

821
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:52,841
- Greene?
- David, don't do it, all right?

822
01:33:53,802 --> 01:33:57,088
This is the way it's always been done,
right?

823
01:33:57,264 --> 01:34:00,384
This is the way it's always been done.

824
01:34:00,559 --> 01:34:05,553
All right. You guys decide.

825
01:34:37,846 --> 01:34:40,882
It's one guy's word
against the other's.

826
01:34:41,058 --> 01:34:45,221
- Maybe we should go to the Head.
- We can handle it ourselves.

827
01:34:45,395 --> 01:34:49,689
- Let's just do it.
- Have we heard from everybody?

828
01:34:49,858 --> 01:34:51,934
Donald?

829
01:34:53,278 --> 01:34:57,062
I submit Dillon didn't cheat.
He didn't have to.

830
01:34:57,241 --> 01:35:01,321
- He'll be fifth generation at Harvard.
- Not like Greene.

831
01:35:01,495 --> 01:35:04,994
- But like McGivern and Princeton?
- So?

832
01:35:05,165 --> 01:35:07,738
So, nothing's for sure, McGoo.

833
01:35:18,428 --> 01:35:22,675
Let's go over this again.
There's an objective fact.

834
01:35:22,849 --> 01:35:25,091
One has lied and one hasn't.

835
01:35:25,269 --> 01:35:28,056
- David never lied.
- Yes, he did.

836
01:35:28,230 --> 01:35:31,895
- He lied about being a Jew.
- No one asked him.

837
01:35:32,067 --> 01:35:35,768
Because no one had any idea,
because he lied.

838
01:35:39,074 --> 01:35:43,985
Gierasch says it was block-printed.
No way to tell who wrote it.

839
01:35:45,330 --> 01:35:49,458
He said the reputation of the school
is on our shoulders.

840
01:35:49,626 --> 01:35:53,838
- Screw the school! What about us?
- We get our lives ruined.

841
01:35:54,006 --> 01:35:57,421
My life is screwed
if I don't get into Yale.

842
01:35:57,592 --> 01:36:02,931
- I need my grades for a scholarship.
- I can't tell my father I failed History.

843
01:36:03,098 --> 01:36:07,143
We've busted our butts,
now one person is killing us.

844
01:36:07,728 --> 01:36:10,978
- It's got to be Greene.
- Rip, what do you think?

845
01:36:12,149 --> 01:36:16,443
I don't know. I mean, what's
so different about him, anyway?

846
01:36:16,611 --> 01:36:19,897
Everything!
It's like my dad says about Jews.

847
01:36:20,073 --> 01:36:23,359
He madly tried to ingratiate himself.

848
01:36:23,535 --> 01:36:26,821
- Bullshit!
- He wanted success without working.

849
01:36:26,997 --> 01:36:31,410
- He was a senior.
- Jesus! Leave the Jewish stuff out!

850
01:36:31,585 --> 01:36:35,036
We can't, because David is Jewish,
stupid!

851
01:36:35,213 --> 01:36:37,586
- You're a bigot.
- I resent that.

852
01:36:37,758 --> 01:36:41,672
Resent it all you want.
You were the first to needle him.

853
01:36:41,845 --> 01:36:44,087
Hey! Hey!

854
01:36:45,265 --> 01:36:47,673
I confess.

855
01:36:47,851 --> 01:36:51,386
I admit it, you know,
I'm an anti-Semite.

856
01:36:51,563 --> 01:36:55,062
I crack Jew jokes.
I think they're greedy, pushy.

857
01:36:56,151 --> 01:37:00,860
But you want to know something else?
David Greene's the first one I met.

858
01:37:01,031 --> 01:37:04,281
- What's your point?
- He was a good guy.

859
01:37:04,451 --> 01:37:06,527
That guy wouldn't cheat.

860
01:37:08,330 --> 01:37:12,030
- Which means you think Dillon did.
- Yeah, I do.

861
01:37:12,209 --> 01:37:14,664
That makes two of us.

862
01:37:17,798 --> 01:37:21,048
- Three.
- I can't believe this!

863
01:37:21,218 --> 01:37:25,085
- I can't either.
- You're dumping Dillon for a dirty Jew!

864
01:37:38,235 --> 01:37:40,939
It's now one a.m.
Are we going to decide?

865
01:37:41,113 --> 01:37:43,271
Not unless we can be fair.

866
01:37:43,448 --> 01:37:46,449
You know he cheated.
We know what Jews are like.

867
01:37:46,618 --> 01:37:50,367
How many do you know?
When did you last have one home?

868
01:37:50,539 --> 01:37:52,531
I only have to know one.

869
01:37:52,707 --> 01:37:56,539
- He stole Dillon's place on the team.
- Then his girl.

870
01:37:56,711 --> 01:38:00,330
- Stabbed him in the back.
- He's not even paying.

871
01:38:00,507 --> 01:38:04,505
Wake up, guys!
Can't you see what's going on here?

872
01:38:05,345 --> 01:38:09,094
You want to nail Greene
because he knew how you feel.

873
01:38:09,266 --> 01:38:11,472
- Anyone else tired of this?
- Yes!

874
01:38:11,643 --> 01:38:15,771
- Let's vote. Hands or secret ballots?
- Secret ballots.

875
01:38:15,939 --> 01:38:19,273
Look, if we do this,
we do it out in the open!

876
01:38:19,443 --> 01:38:22,360
Ballots!

877
01:38:56,605 --> 01:38:59,392
As Head Prefect, I've been asked...

878
01:39:07,657 --> 01:39:12,035
It's the finding of the class,
the majority of the class,

879
01:39:12,204 --> 01:39:15,537
that the guilt lies with David Greene.

880
01:39:17,584 --> 01:39:22,460
Mr Greene, you're requested
to turn yourself in to the headmaster.

881
01:39:36,520 --> 01:39:38,596
All right.

882
01:39:39,439 --> 01:39:41,847
I'll honour your traditions.

883
01:39:42,025 --> 01:39:44,267
I'll go to the headmaster.

884
01:39:44,444 --> 01:39:46,520
And I'll lie.

885
01:40:03,588 --> 01:40:05,664
Thanks, buddy.

886
01:40:06,883 --> 01:40:09,042
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

887
01:40:36,663 --> 01:40:38,869
Good morning, Mr Greene.

888
01:40:39,541 --> 01:40:43,206
We were wondering
if you'd changed your mind.

889
01:40:43,378 --> 01:40:47,956
- You know why I'm here?
- Indeed. To confess to cheating.

890
01:40:48,842 --> 01:40:52,127
That's right.
I cheated on the History exam.

891
01:40:52,304 --> 01:40:55,886
No, David. You did no such thing.

892
01:41:04,274 --> 01:41:07,477
I saw Dillon cheat.

893
01:41:09,029 --> 01:41:12,563
He was my roommate for four years.

894
01:41:30,925 --> 01:41:34,176
Thank you, Mr Van Kelt.
You're excused.

895
01:41:38,725 --> 01:41:40,883
David...

896
01:41:41,061 --> 01:41:43,137
I'm sorry.

897
01:41:53,990 --> 01:41:58,237
- I did break the Honour Code.
- Yes. As did Van Kelt.

898
01:41:58,411 --> 01:42:04,414
But the Honour Code is a living thing.
It cannot exist in a vacuum.

899
01:42:05,210 --> 01:42:10,797
We absolve you both on that account.
Mr Dillon, however, is expelled.

900
01:42:12,550 --> 01:42:17,462
David, you represent the best
of what we hope for at St Matthew's.

901
01:42:17,639 --> 01:42:20,924
Please, don't think of leaving.

902
01:42:24,562 --> 01:42:26,851
Good. Then it's settled.

903
01:42:27,691 --> 01:42:31,735
- I'd like to forget this ever happened.
- No, sir.

904
01:42:32,404 --> 01:42:35,773
You never will,
because I'm staying here.

905
01:42:35,949 --> 01:42:39,816
Every day you see me,
you'll remember that it happened.

906
01:42:39,994 --> 01:42:42,153
You used me for football.

907
01:42:42,330 --> 01:42:46,992
I'll use you to get into Harvard.
Excuse me.

908
01:43:07,313 --> 01:43:09,602
You know something?

909
01:43:09,774 --> 01:43:13,108
I'm still going to get into Harvard.

910
01:43:13,278 --> 01:43:16,896
And in ten years,
