1
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,450
They've found another one.

2
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:11,290
There's going to be not a treasure left
by the time she gets here.

3
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,390
Mark the location.

4
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,210
That's the French mast.

5
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,900
And over there, crystals.

6
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,560
They're all coming.

7
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,370
All except one.

8
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:23,470
All right, follow Crystals.

9
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:26,100
When he dives, we dive.

10
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:30,640
Maybe we'll get luck and
find what it is down there.

11
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,920
Hey. Look at that, Jimmy, look.

12
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,315
Why isn't she slowing down?

13
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,340
You ask her.
- No way.

14
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,940
Hello, boys. You're wet.

15
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,480
Half the world's trade is already here.

16
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,410
And you make us wait.

17
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:14,995
But you know I can't resist to be defied.

18
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:19,890
Lara, tell us, what's all this fuss about it?

19
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:21,810
What does everyone think is down there?

20
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:24,160
I don't know what everybody
thinks is down there, but.

21
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,555
I think it's the Luna Temp.

22
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,960
The Luna Temp?

23
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,890
My sons, if it is not on television, forget it.

24
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,810
It's a temple built by Alexander the Great.

25
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:35,850
who was Greek, in case you don't know.
- Yeah, yeah.

26
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:38,200
Alexander collected treasures
from all over the world.

27
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,890
He stored them in two places.

28
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:42,920
The majority went to his library in Egypt.

29
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,740
But his most priced possessions,

30
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,200
went here,

31
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,000
the Luna Temple.

32
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,450
By law, no one was allowed
to record its location.

33
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:53,330
And in 330 B.C., it was...

34
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,210
...swallowed by the sea...

35
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,530
...destroyed, during a volcanic eruption,

36
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,630
lost forever,

37
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,140
until yesterday.

38
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,810
Even half the temple is intact,

39
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:08,080
it would still be the greatest find
since the pyramids.

40
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,970
The others heading to this area here
along the shore...

41
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,870
That's based on the currents.
- Yes.

42
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:16,760
Oh. This is it goes, it's why I was late. -Oh.

43
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,480
It's geological.

44
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,360
Take him two hours after the quake.

45
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,690
The epic enter was here,

46
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:22,750
five miles northeast of us.

47
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:26,660
But, look at the current along the shore now.

48
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,970
Wait, they've shifted.

49
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,290
So, while they're all diving there,

50
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:36,060
the wind will actually be...

51
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,620
Here.

52
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,900
Let's go.

53
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,540
Something wrong?

54
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,680
First Alexander doesn't
report the temple's location.

55
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:11,920
Then God washed it from the earth
with a volcano.

56
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,570
Now even the currents changed.

57
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:19,340
Lara, maybe this temple
is not meant to be found.

58
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,845
Everything lost is meant to be found.

59
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,420
Don't worry.

60
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,020
Incredible.

61
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,860
It's unbelievable.

62
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:31,890
God.

63
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,990
It's huge.

64
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:42,340
Wonderful.

65
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,955
Jimmy, this is wonderful...

66
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,200
Do you see what I see?
- Oh my god.

67
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,595
Oh my god.
- It's incredible.

68
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,060
Nicky, look at these.

69
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,260
We're going to be rich.

70
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,150
Hey, Lara.

71
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,320
What do you say to two
handsome Greek partners?

72
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:07,150
When you find two, let me know.

73
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:10,650
Heard? She's talking about you. -No, you.

74
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:16,180
Luckily gold coins...give me that...

75
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,780
Lara, what is that?

76
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,780
It's mine.

77
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,140
What is she doing?

78
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,420
Lara. That column is collapsing.

79
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,900
After shows.

80
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,960
I think that's the sign leave.

81
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:48,970
Two minutes.

82
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:51,010
Lara, we need to leave now.

83
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:53,110
We've got to go.

84
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:05,688
Keep packing. -Do you think
it's going to collapse?

85
00:11:05,788 --> 00:11:06,840
You take those two.

86
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,200
We have to hurry up.

87
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:12,465
We're going to go,
we're going to go now. Come on.

88
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,340
They're coming up.

89
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,240
Lara.

90
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:58,145
Lara, it's us, Hillary and Bryce.

91
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:04,240
She's disorientated, that's
normal after three days.

92
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,340
Nice day for a dip?

93
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:11,860
Gentlemen, there is an expression,

94
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,900
'It's not nice to fool Mother Nature.'

95
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:22,000
Yet that is precisely what
I've been doing for some time now.

96
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,960
Whether it will be sorren gas for Mr. Zap...

97
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:30,530
...improved typhoid for Mr.
Croft to use in the Balkans...

98
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:32,970
...enhanced cholera for Mr. Devalia.

99
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:36,640
But, while these weapons
served their purpose,

100
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:39,820
there have always been limitations.

101
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:43,700
Stable diseases aren't lethal.

102
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,985
deadly ones burn out too quickly.

103
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:50,665
Mother Nature can only be fooled so much.

104
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:54,570
Deploy my weapon, and your
enemies, however great,

105
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:57,180
will collapse...

106
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,155
...rather Mr. Monza is collapsing right now.

107
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:16,050
What the hell is going on?

108
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:19,050
Monza told MI6 about this meeting.

109
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:21,240
That's why the change of location.

110
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,290
He was going to turn me over to them...

111
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:26,450
...and then seek asylum in the West.

112
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:31,710
A smart man would have known
I was onto him.

113
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:33,400
would never have got on the plane...

114
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,530
...but I knew you would, Mr. Monze...

115
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:39,880
...because you actually
thought you could fool me.

116
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,820
That, gentlemen,

117
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,660
is the sound of a traitor dying.

118
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,230
That was an accelerated form of Ebola,

119
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:01,920
the deadliest disease known to man...

120
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:04,020
...highly contagious.

121
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:09,530
However, as with all known diseases...

122
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:14,135
...there exist stockpiles
of anti serums in the West.

123
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:44,200
There is no anti-serum for
what I'm offering you...

124
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,090
...no treatment...

125
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,960
...no vaccine, no cure.

126
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:50,650
The modern world has never seen
anything like what I've uncovered.

127
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,440
Uncovered?

128
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,540
Yes, I branched that.

129
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,020
Archaeology.

130
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:05,020
07744681, that is the account at the
landesbank in Bern.

131
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:09,540
$100 million dollars each, if you please.

132
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:16,140
[Hong Kong Chai Wan Private Airport].

133
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,120
Where's Chen Lo?

134
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:37,160
He's got the orb, but MI6 is onto him.

135
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:37,930
How?

136
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:38,570
He doesn't he know,

137
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:41,600
but rather than risk bringing it to you,
he's waiting.

138
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,650
I have just told a cabin full of men
about Pandora.

139
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,650
the clock cannot be reset.

140
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:50,490
Tell Chen Lo to bring the orb to me at once.

141
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,050
Find the killers,

142
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:10,150
don't take it on to me.

143
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,770
Bryce, what have we got?

144
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:34,225
I haven't even finished loading
the images from your camera yet.

145
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,730
We've got references to an orb.

146
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,250
I took the liberty of checking.

147
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:41,970
Historic inventories of the Luna Temple
do not list any orb.

148
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,730
I want you both to list...

149
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:47,655
...every orb ever
mentioned in Greek history.

150
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:53,660
Ah.

151
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:02,780
That's... liable...to be...

152
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,300
...thousands.

153
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,470
Then we'll read thousands.

154
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,060
Start with that one.

155
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,250
Perhaps you gentlemen would like
some tea while you're waiting?

156
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:14,050
No, they wouldn't.

157
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:15,200
Tea is for guests.

158
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,510
The door is for intruders.

159
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:21,030
Lara, these men are from MI6.

160
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:24,330
Yes, I can tell from their
soft hands and pressed suits.

161
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:25,730
that these are the men
who made decisions...

162
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:27,320
...and leave the dirty work for others.

163
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,490
I have no interest in...

164
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:30,590
His name is Chen Lo...

165
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,570
...along with his brother Xien,

166
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:35,360
he runs a gang of Chinese bandits
known as Shay Ling.

167
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:38,160
They deal in gun, diamonds
and antiquities, anything that.

168
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:40,040
Chen Lo can sell them in the black market.

169
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,290
They've followed you the moment
you arrived at Santralina.

170
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:44,570
where they killed your friend Gus
and sank his boat.

171
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:45,640
Why?

172
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,320
For this.

173
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,030
After you were picked up in sea...

174
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:51,410
...our listening post in
Mota intercepted that fax...

175
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:54,370
...it was sent from Chen Lo to a
man named Jonathan Reiss.

176
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:55,720
What, a scientist?

177
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,320
won a Nobel Prize.

178
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:00,840
He is now the foremost designer of
biological weapons in the world.

179
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,370
His creation has been in the heart of...

180
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:05,150
...every active bio-terror
in the past 15 years.

181
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,810
Reiss's disdain for life is legendary.

182
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:08,450
He has no political agenda.

183
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:12,290
He doesn't care who his
weapons kill or why.

184
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,670
A modern-day Dr. Mengelen.

185
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,090
We know Chen Lo followed you
in order to obtain the orb.

186
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:22,810
we also know he'll deliver it to Reiss.

187
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:24,170
What we don't know is why.

188
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:26,565
Candidly, that terrifies us.

189
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,700
Pandora's box.

190
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:38,795
Reiss is going to use the orb
to find Pandora's Box.

191
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,840
Do you mean the Greek myth?

192
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,470
Pandora was given a box by God,

193
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:43,590
told not to open it, she does...

194
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,600
...and unleashes pain into the world.

195
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:48,930
That's the Sunday school version, yes.

196
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,720
How do you think life began?

197
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:53,540
Shooting stars, primordial ooze.

198
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:56,850
In 2200 B.C.. an Egyptian Pharaoh...

199
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:59,010
...found a place he named
the Cradle of Life...

200
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:01,690
...where, we, life, began...

201
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:03,640
...and there he found a box...

202
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,640
...the box which brought life to earth.

203
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,810
The Pharaoh opened the box...

204
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:09,640
...but all that was left inside
was Ramante, or empty life,...

205
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:12,570
...the plague which came
as the companion to life.

206
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:13,530
Companion?

207
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:15,290
Nature is about balance.

208
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:16,930
All the world comes and passes.

209
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,890
yin and yang, right and
wrong, men and women,

210
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:20,130
what's a pleasure with pain?

211
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:21,610
What did this plague do?

212
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,260
It leveled the Pharaoh's army.

213
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,930
The Pharaohs's son dispatched...

214
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:27,280
...the finest soldiers to take the box,

215
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:30,865
and transport it to the end of the world.

216
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:35,880
2000 years later, Alexander
the Great reached India...

217
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:38,090
...where his army was ravaged by a plague.

218
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:41,610
After one of his men found a box
among some of the men.

219
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:45,200
India, that's what the
Pharaoh's men wrote it.

220
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,210
Alexander felt that...

221
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:47,990
...the box was too powerful to be trusted to
any man...

222
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:50,520
...so he returned it to its home
the Cradle of Life.

223
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:53,120
And it has not been seen since.

224
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:56,260
And this Cradle of Life is where?

225
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,640
No one knows.

226
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:00,000
Alexander found it using a map
that was with the box.

227
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,690
a map he then hid from the world.

228
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,930
But the name he gave this map...

229
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:08,830
...was Mati and the literal translation for
the word Mati is 'eye'.

230
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:11,780
it orbits the map...

231
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:14,920
...hidden in the Luna Temple by Alexander.

232
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:17,050
And Reiss will use it to find Pandora's Box.

233
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:19,530
And when he does he opens it.

234
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:29,560
The markings definitely
form a pattern, but...

235
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:31,970
...even if I figure out what they represent...

236
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:32,810
...we still can't read the whole map...

237
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:36,280
...because we're going to get past
the view of these, see?

238
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:37,970
We have to figure out how to read it.

239
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,760
Right, thank you.

240
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:42,770
On behalf of her Majesty,
we firmly request...

241
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:46,160
...that you find and recover
this box before Dr. Reiss.

242
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:50,000
Oh. Now that I have her
Majesty's permission.

243
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,070
Tell me where to find the orb.

244
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:54,010
The last we heard, it
was somewhere in China...

245
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:55,290
...with Chen Lo and Sha Ling...

246
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:57,250
...finding them would be
next to impossible...

247
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:59,050
...we'll assign two of
our best agents to help.

248
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:00,680
I don't want them.

249
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:03,510
With due respect, your expertise
is archaeology, doesn't...

250
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:05,120
I didn't say that I don't need help.

251
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:07,720
But your agents would never
get me to Chen Lo in time.

252
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:11,040
I need an insider
someone who knows the Shei Ling...

253
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:13,945
...their methods, their hideouts.

254
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,300
I need Terry Sheridan.

255
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:19,090
Not in a million year...

256
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:22,505
...not if you're the last man on earth.

257
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:25,880
Terry Sheridan, former
commander of the Royal Marine...

258
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:28,680
...turned a mercenary, and a traitor.

259
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:30,430
You don't honestly expect
me to put that man...

260
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:31,250
...on a trail to hold weapons...

261
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:35,855
...you can turn around and
sell to the highest bidder?

262
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:40,340
[Kazahkstan, Barla Kala Prison].

263
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,380
Open.

264
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:54,320
I'm your host, Armika.

265
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,740
Welcome to Fantasy Island.

266
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:48,780
Croft.

267
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,820
Hello, Terry.

268
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:01,040
So what do you think of my new place?

269
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:03,140
Not quite Croft manner.

270
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:07,150
What, a key to your heart?

271
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:09,220
To a flat in Zurich.

272
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,310
You can pick another city if you want.

273
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:15,850
Your record will be expound,
your citizenship restored.

274
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:16,800
Why?

275
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:17,890
MI6.

276
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:19,840
MI6.

277
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:23,400
Now would that make me Faust,
or the Devil?

278
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,490
Well, you can pick one.

279
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:26,640
because MI6 would also
arrange a new identity.

280
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:29,040
Oh yeah, do you think I need their help?

281
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:32,115
Oh, having two faces doesn't count.

282
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:35,060
So what do I have to do?

283
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,450
You need to take me to the Shay Ling.

284
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,960
She who?

285
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,430
There's a man named Chen Lo...

286
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:42,770
...who took something from me and
I want it back.

287
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:45,080
Yeah. Is that you, or MI6?

288
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:46,730
Also, I've arranged the government...

289
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:49,010
...to wire you 5 million in sterling
when we succeed.

290
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:50,810
you can call it second chance, man.

291
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:53,000
All right, then insurance for you?

292
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,100
I don't need any.

293
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:00,380
You and I working alone?

294
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:04,040
And it's easier to see through you, that way.

295
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,010
So what if afterwards.

296
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:10,090
MI6 decide that me back in the world
isn't such a great idea?

297
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:15,290
Then I'll feel sorry for whomever
they get to come after you.

298
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:20,910
Do you have authorization to kill me, Croft?

299
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:22,890
Any time, for any reason.

300
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:25,070
So why don't you just do it now?

301
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:27,610
What is it they see?

302
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:29,850
Hell have no fury.

303
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:31,560
You're not that good.

304
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:34,465
Shay Ling and the groove's Croft.

305
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:37,440
They move constantly.

306
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:41,000
And they're in almost the most
remote mountain region in China.

307
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,100
Region?

308
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:45,860
You have to do better than that.

309
00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:01,525
Get me into China, and I'll
get you to them in a day.

310
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:05,521
No guns, no money, no
weapons of any kind.

311
00:30:05,621 --> 00:30:08,851
Talk about taking the fun out of life.

312
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,810
Shay Ling has spies all over China.

313
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:27,610
We have to get into country undetected...

314
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:29,970
...so we'll slip into
Beijing, and we go by truck.

315
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:30,690
Truck?

316
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:34,955
I wasn't thinking about
something a little faster.

317
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:42,340
A little faster?

318
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:50,425
Well, this is a little faster.
But the Chinese will track the pod.

319
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,530
There won't be any pod to find.

320
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:55,435
Will there be any of us to fight?

321
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:03,875
Ready? now.
- Ready for what?

322
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:26,300
The ditching was good, Croft.
I'll give you that.

323
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:31,735
But we'll never find a vehicle
in a place like this.

324
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:35,010
...ni hao...

325
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:36,720
...ni hao.

326
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,820
It's lovely to see you.

327
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:42,850
So is everything ready?

328
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:47,370
Yes. Your clothes, guns,
and knives, are over there.

329
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:51,440
And I took the liberty of tuning your bike.

330
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,540
May I?
- Yes.

331
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,210
Lara.

332
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:13,590
Ah, what is the happy couple up to?

333
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:15,690
Accessorizing.

334
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,730
- Where are we on reading the orb?

335
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:20,600
All maps have a key, Lara,
scale or legend, yes?

336
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,350
The orb's key is not on orbit,

337
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:23,640
it must have been lost.

338
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:25,760
or somewhere in the temple.

339
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,650
Go through every image I took...

340
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:30,000
...start with the ones near the orb.

341
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,160
key must have been linked
to it in some way.

342
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:34,970
Right, well then...

343
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:37,690
It's unlike Lara to take a partner.

344
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:39,720
Where are you two going?

345
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,970
We're taking a nice little trip.

346
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:44,960
breathe some fresh mountain air...

347
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:48,595
...stop by my friends the Shay Ling.

348
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:02,490
Shay Ling watch all the roads.

349
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:04,050
We have to go around the back.

350
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:06,150
We'll go straight.

351
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,920
Maybe you didn't hear me.

352
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:12,320
Shay Ling have men on every road
from here to Luo Yang.

353
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:14,420
Not every road.

354
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,410
Getting rusty, are we?

355
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:49,280
Oh, I think it's coming back.

356
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,450
I expected more from a Scot.

357
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:54,840
I don't expect anything
from an English woman.

358
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:58,765
Good, cause you're not
going to get anything.

359
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:36,480
Party's over.

360
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,705
From now on it's by foot.

361
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:44,360
Best to reconsider that "no gun" rule.

362
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:46,460
No.

363
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,935
And don't be looking at my ass.

364
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,450
So where do I fit in?

365
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:02,490
What do you mean?

366
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:03,210
You'll the guide.

367
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:05,470
I mean...when you think back...

368
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:08,680
...on the vast scheme of
hugely adventurous life...

369
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:10,780
...where do I fit in?

370
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,370
Is that a love of your life?

371
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:14,800
Or just another bump on the road?

372
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,850
Was that time well spent?

373
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:19,755
Four months, more good than bad?

374
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:25,095
Come on I had to be more
than that, am I right?

375
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,700
All right.

376
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,940
It was five months.

377
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:33,440
You're laughing at me?

378
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:37,875
No, no. It's the fact that I
used to find you charming.

379
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,220
I am charming.

380
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:07,660
You're late.

381
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:14,820
Tilt your head back. Do it!

382
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:22,045
You might see again in a hour. Maybe.

383
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,400
What's this?

384
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,240
It's not there.

385
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:38,340
There's no orb.

386
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:42,990
Is it anything you can tell me about this?

387
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:57,920
Hello.

388
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:00,050
I think it you don't like your messenger.

389
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:03,640
I didn't, but I did like
the men I lost in a temple.

390
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:06,080
You underestimated Lady Croft.

391
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:10,250
I underestimated how
much this orb is worth.

392
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:13,010
So many horrible diseases in the world...

393
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:16,410
...things we are particularly
susceptible to as children.

394
00:37:16,861 --> 00:37:19,581
You never know when you could be holding
little Shiho or Tai by the hand,

395
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:22,981
as a mysterious ailment
ravages their bodies.

396
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:25,720
You kill them,

397
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:28,480
and I'll give your orb to Lady Croft.

398
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:31,580
My men tell me, she's a
few miles away from here...

399
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,680
...as we speak.

400
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:34,800
I wonder how much she would pay.

401
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:37,770
I'll pay you an additional $12 million dollars.

402
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:40,690
It will be yours once you've delivered the orb...

403
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:43,240
...along with Lady Croft's body.

404
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:45,490
I don't think you know where they are.

405
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:46,450
You're impossible you know that.

406
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:49,930
I think you pretended to know
so I would get you out.

407
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:54,040
This isn't a tomb Croft,
and the Shay Ling aren't mummies.

408
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,290
They're killers.

409
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:57,600
But if you don't trust me.

410
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:06,755
I'm sorry I have to do this
but you're wasting time.

411
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,800
You want to shoot me, shoot me.

412
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:16,020
Personally, I'd rather you do it than them.

413
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:28,100
bu xu dong (Stay right there. ).

414
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:37,880
Well, Terry, what part of
'never come back again'

415
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,980
didn't you understand?

416
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:46,150
You wanted to fight the Shay Ling.

417
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:51,930
The only way to get into their place
is as their prisoners.

418
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:54,450
You want to tell me that in jail before.

419
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:55,480
Would you have believed me?

420
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:58,890
Make Chen Lo a better
offer than his buyer.

421
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:00,200
He'll cross them.

422
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:03,360
Even if his buyer is Jonathan Reiss?

423
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:07,520
You might've told me that before!

424
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,320
Were you really going to kill me?

425
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:52,460
Oh, I bet she would have.

426
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:55,420
I've seen her in action.

427
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:56,720
Didn't Terry tell you?

428
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:59,280
The last time any of us saw him,

429
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:01,680
he was riding away with a truck...

430
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:04,075
...full of my Ming vases...

431
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:10,140
...and sitting next to him, was his sister.

432
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:13,290
Oh, how is she?

433
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:14,720
You...

434
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,900
...shouldn't come here.

435
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:20,040
They got me out of prison...

436
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:22,640
...Besides, the lady has a good offer...

437
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,320
...better than Reiss.

438
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:25,570
Really?

439
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:27,670
Should I take it?

440
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:28,690
Take it.

441
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:30,570
Or better yet,

442
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:36,000
you and I run some horrendous thing
back to the British for triple.

443
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,880
Let's talk.

444
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:39,980
Not you, Terry.

445
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:42,580
Lady Croft and I.

446
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:44,780
You wait here.

447
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:46,290
Catch up.

448
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:48,600
There will be four minute.

449
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:52,140
Terrific.

450
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:59,515
There's something I think
you will have appreciated.

451
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:11,195
This is the largest group of
terracotta warriors I have found.

452
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:13,520
The king of Qin made them...

453
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:15,270
...for use in the afterlife...

454
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:19,050
...to fend off enemies he made in this one.

455
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:22,465
Sounds like we could both use a set.

456
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:25,945
I would be happy to sell some to you.

457
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:28,240
I hope you're as
entrepreneurial with the Orb.

458
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:30,890
You lost men, I lost men.

459
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:33,970
I see no reason we should both lose again.

460
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:37,210
If I want double, would Reiss offer it to me?

461
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:38,240
Is it here?

462
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:39,490
It's worth a lot.

463
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:41,090
Well then, if you know that,

464
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:44,320
you'll know Reiss will also kill you
the moment you give it to him.

465
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:46,430
And your government would
guarantee my safety?

466
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:47,760
No.

467
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:49,240
But I will.

468
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:53,100
That must hurt, saying that to me.

469
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:56,260
Take the offer.

470
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:05,920
You presume to give me orders?

471
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:08,430
Take the offer before it expires.

472
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:10,400
No.

473
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,320
Then I would have to force you.

474
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:14,970
Then I would have to kill you.

475
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:25,245
Has it been four minutes yet?

476
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:08,980
That was nice.

477
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:13,250
It's too bad, you're on the wrong side.

478
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:18,870
Tell me where the orb is,
and it spares your life.

479
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:23,960
The Flower Pagoda in Shanghai, 9 PM.

480
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:29,620
This is mine.

481
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:40,700
Now, we're even.

482
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:50,790
Freeze. Put your hands up.

483
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:16,350
Remember that no gun
rule? I reconsidered.

484
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:50,335
Lara, there was a staircase
we could have used.

485
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:16,440
Lara, are you all right?

486
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:19,430
Smashing. I'm on my way to Shanghai.

487
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:22,560
And I need you to look at something for me.

488
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:25,200
It's in the Luna Temple near the orb.

489
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:28,600
And I'm betting it's key to those markings.

490
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:32,610
She's holding some sort
of musical instrument.

491
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:35,340
It's sound.

492
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:36,680
That's brilliant.

493
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:39,130
Key must have linked into it some way.

494
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:40,970
I'll start decoding the images we have.

495
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:42,960
Good.
- You give us the rest, bye, Lara.

496
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:45,060
Miss you.
- Bye.

497
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:50,900
[Shanghai].

498
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:03,620
Flower Pagoda, 8:50 pm.

499
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:40,260
Trouble is coming, let's go.

500
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:52,900
well.

501
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:55,620
Just like old times.

502
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:05,020
I think that's the first time you've
actually smiled because of me.

503
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:13,040
Why did you do it?

504
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,610
I started thinking.

505
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:18,090
I was...tired of doing things
for somebody else's way...

506
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:20,570
...and it was always going
to be somebody else's way.

507
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:24,440
So you abandoned your men and
betrayed your country.

508
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:26,330
Leaving my men and my country...

509
00:48:26,430 --> 00:48:30,160
...that didn't actually
hurt as much as I thought.

510
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:32,555
But leaving you did.

511
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:37,470
You're a hard act to follow, Croft.

512
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:46,320
You know why you and I
get along so well?

513
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:48,420
No.

514
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:51,665
We are two of a kind, me and you.

515
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:56,390
We are nothing alike.

516
00:48:56,490 --> 00:48:59,295
I don't think we're alike.
- Um hm.

517
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:00,910
But do you think we're a pair?

518
00:49:01,010 --> 00:49:03,820
Opposite sides of the same coin.

519
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:30,050
My men have the roof covered.

520
00:49:30,150 --> 00:49:32,120
Why don't you set down
at the square instead.

521
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:35,360
That way, my men would
also have things covered.

522
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:37,320
Okay, fine.

523
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:39,420
Okay, so, let's go.

524
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:46,005
We're arriving at the square.

525
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:48,680
We're in the wrong position.

526
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:50,120
Stairs? -No time.

527
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:51,680
Rooftops?
- No.

528
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:53,320
I've got a plan.

529
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:55,970
Stay here, wait for my signal.

530
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:02,875
Here's your money, come and get it.

531
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:12,000
Wait for my signal, pal.

532
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:13,010
Give me that box.

533
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:15,490
You give me the money first.

534
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:30,340
Get out of here.

535
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:12,900
Go, run her over.

536
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:29,355
Yeah.
- We tried it your way,

537
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:30,680
now we'll do it mine.

538
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:32,820
- Bring it to the top of the pagoda now!

539
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:34,980
Okay.

540
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:25,765
Come on, come on. Hold it up.

541
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:42,490
Now we're going to your brother.

542
00:52:42,590 --> 00:52:44,590
We're too late.

543
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:48,185
Lara, what are you doing?

544
00:52:58,540 --> 00:53:00,540
Take us up.

545
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:05,660
Move. Go.

546
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:14,740
Let's go, move.

547
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:29,560
I'm getting tired of you
pointing that thing at me.

548
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:31,650
Are you okay?
- Never better.

549
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:34,555
It looks like we've lost the orb.

550
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:38,770
Please! You don't think I'd go
vaulting in the thin air for nothing, do you?

551
00:53:38,870 --> 00:53:41,505
I've put a tracer on the crate.

552
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:44,290
Got it.

553
00:53:44,390 --> 00:53:46,390
Look.

554
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:51,940
Impressive.

555
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:59,300
[Hong Kong].

556
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:22,340
A weapons lab
in the middle of the city? No way.

557
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:25,080
He must have dumped that in the Cradle.

558
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:27,180
No, it's here.

559
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:29,940
One of the buildings?

560
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:32,620
No.

561
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:35,990
It's exactly where we're standing.

562
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:43,010
There's part of me that always
allowed for the possibility...

563
00:54:43,110 --> 00:54:46,120
...that Pandora's Box was just a legend.

564
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:48,430
But now I know it's there.

565
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:55,560
She escaped.

566
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:57,600
She has no idea where we are.

567
00:54:57,700 --> 00:54:59,700
We take no chances.

568
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:01,973
Have everything we need...

569
00:55:02,073 --> 00:55:06,578
...to manufacture an antidote
transferred to the jet.

570
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:09,760
I need an orb for two people.

571
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:11,900
Mid-city, soon.

572
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:15,820
What? Are you crazy?

573
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:18,800
Who is that?

574
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:20,900
Piece of cake.

575
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:26,900
Wang Jie, come in.

576
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:33,180
Hello.

577
00:57:20,941 --> 00:57:22,321
So much for easy.

578
00:57:22,421 --> 00:57:24,421
What is that?

579
00:57:27,501 --> 00:57:30,051
He's already decoding the orb.

580
00:57:30,116 --> 00:57:31,116
Bugger!

581
00:57:33,542 --> 00:57:35,421
Headset.

582
00:57:57,261 --> 00:57:59,641
You've gotta get everyone out.

583
00:57:59,741 --> 00:58:02,971
How would you suggest, the fire alarm?

584
00:58:10,061 --> 00:58:12,161
Not bad. But that's just the alarm.

585
00:58:12,261 --> 00:58:13,681
There's no danger.

586
00:58:13,781 --> 00:58:18,796
Do you think anyone here
is paid enough to take that chance?

587
00:58:25,142 --> 00:58:26,981
Don't even think about it.

588
00:58:28,621 --> 00:58:30,621
It's her.

589
00:58:33,621 --> 00:58:35,621
Yes.

590
00:59:45,101 --> 00:59:46,641
I'm glad, Lara.

591
00:59:46,741 --> 00:59:49,121
It would have been too easy.

592
00:59:53,342 --> 00:59:54,942
Give me your best!

593
01:00:11,781 --> 01:00:13,781
How's that?

594
01:00:14,621 --> 01:00:15,591
I'm going offline.

595
01:00:15,691 --> 01:00:17,691
Oh, don't...

596
01:00:20,941 --> 01:00:21,681
Thanks.

597
01:00:21,781 --> 01:00:23,781
You're welcome.

598
01:00:25,861 --> 01:00:28,811
Hello boys, did you
understand the medallion?

599
01:00:28,911 --> 01:00:31,731
Yeah, yeah, the markings are sound waves.

600
01:00:31,831 --> 01:00:33,891
We've translating the
markings from your images...

601
01:00:33,991 --> 01:00:35,401
...roughly half the orb.

602
01:00:35,501 --> 01:00:37,201
Well let's complete the set, then.

603
01:00:37,301 --> 01:00:39,761
I'll record the rest of the images
and send them to you.

604
01:00:39,861 --> 01:00:41,971
Once you have them,
finish the translation...

605
01:00:42,071 --> 01:00:45,216
...and transmit the sounds back to me.

606
01:00:55,661 --> 01:00:57,661
We need more backup.

607
01:01:13,101 --> 01:01:15,101
Smart girl.

608
01:01:33,901 --> 01:01:35,901
Get down.

609
01:01:37,861 --> 01:01:39,401
Move.

610
01:01:39,501 --> 01:01:40,411
Don't shoot her.

611
01:01:40,511 --> 01:01:44,241
Not until I make sure the
computer has done its job.

612
01:01:44,341 --> 01:01:45,531
Do you honestly believe...

613
01:01:45,631 --> 01:01:47,311
...you'll be able to
control what's in that box?

614
01:01:47,411 --> 01:01:49,211
And turn that into one of your weapons?

615
01:01:49,311 --> 01:01:51,361
Really, Lara. You disappoint me.

616
01:01:51,461 --> 01:01:55,286
Have we received payment
from all the buyers?

617
01:01:57,261 --> 01:01:59,601
You're the one who controls the orb.

618
01:01:59,701 --> 01:02:01,741
You're using the buyers.

619
01:02:01,821 --> 01:02:04,811
They'll release it thinking
it's just another weapon.

620
01:02:04,911 --> 01:02:06,361
And the world blames them.

621
01:02:06,461 --> 01:02:09,776
What's left of the world blames them.

622
01:02:10,821 --> 01:02:12,651
Once I get hold of the buyers.

623
01:02:12,751 --> 01:02:13,801
I'll make enough antidote...

624
01:02:13,901 --> 01:02:16,841
...to protect the best and the brightest.

625
01:02:16,941 --> 01:02:16,931
Heads of corporations.

626
01:02:17,031 --> 01:02:19,031
Heads of states...

627
01:02:19,111 --> 01:02:20,211
...life will go on.

628
01:02:20,311 --> 01:02:22,691
Don't tell me you've looked
around never thought...

629
01:02:22,791 --> 01:02:25,531
...wouldn't the world be a better place
without some of these people?

630
01:02:25,631 --> 01:02:30,731
Well, you can say anything to one person
I can deal with that.

631
01:02:39,301 --> 01:02:41,321
You would have been
welcome in my world.

632
01:02:41,421 --> 01:02:43,421
Piss off.

633
01:02:43,421 --> 01:02:46,736
Shoot her between the eyes,
no mistakes.

634
01:03:27,541 --> 01:03:29,321
Asshole.

635
01:03:29,421 --> 01:03:31,421
I'm going to get you.

636
01:03:32,061 --> 01:03:34,061
Follow me.

637
01:03:51,181 --> 01:03:53,181
all right.

638
01:04:11,381 --> 01:04:13,381
Don't worry.

639
01:04:41,081 --> 01:04:43,206
Bingo! Two one-way tickets
out of Hong Kong.

640
01:04:46,501 --> 01:04:48,501
Parachutes.

641
01:04:49,221 --> 01:04:51,431
Something a little faster.

642
01:04:53,541 --> 01:04:55,541
Come on, Grandma.

643
01:04:59,141 --> 01:05:02,281
The rendezvous point is
2, 2.5, maybe 3 miles.

644
01:05:02,381 --> 01:05:06,681
You're aware that no one had
ever gone further than one mile?

645
01:05:06,781 --> 01:05:07,731
I'm not.

646
01:05:07,831 --> 01:05:09,241
This way.

647
01:05:09,341 --> 01:05:11,081
Right, you go first.

648
01:05:11,181 --> 01:05:13,181
No, you go first.

649
01:05:16,461 --> 01:05:17,262
I'll go first!!

650
01:05:28,302 --> 01:05:29,822
Holy cow!

651
01:05:30,781 --> 01:05:32,781
Follow her.

652
01:06:48,381 --> 01:06:53,101
Bye Terry. did you see?

653
01:07:10,141 --> 01:07:12,491
I suppose you want to
pay him then, don't you?

654
01:07:12,591 --> 01:07:14,131
What do you get, two,
three, hundred dollars?

655
01:07:14,231 --> 01:07:16,231
$300...expenses.

656
01:08:12,021 --> 01:08:14,021
So this...

657
01:08:16,341 --> 01:08:18,341
...rock is the map.

658
01:08:19,221 --> 01:08:21,221
Yes, it is.

659
01:08:21,461 --> 01:08:25,031
I've never seen anything like it,
have you?

660
01:08:25,221 --> 01:08:28,536
And it's the only way to find that box.

661
01:08:28,701 --> 01:08:30,561
And just think you could take it now.

662
01:08:30,661 --> 01:08:31,771
and walk right out the door.

663
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:36,326
No, when it does better
actually off the ship faster,

664
01:08:36,426 --> 01:08:38,426
harder to track.

665
01:08:39,581 --> 01:08:44,086
Oh, Croft, do you really think
I would do that to you?

666
01:09:20,101 --> 01:09:21,961
You can break my wrist,

667
01:09:22,061 --> 01:09:24,866
but I'm still gonna kiss you.

668
01:10:30,641 --> 01:10:32,991
That's not exactly what I had in mind but..

669
01:10:33,091 --> 01:10:35,091
Okay.

670
01:10:35,201 --> 01:10:37,496
Why didn't you shoot Reiss?

671
01:10:37,761 --> 01:10:38,671
What?

672
01:10:38,771 --> 01:10:42,681
He must have walked right
past you in the lab.

673
01:10:43,281 --> 01:10:45,406
Why didn't you shoot him?

674
01:10:45,561 --> 01:10:46,981
I didn't have a close shot.

675
01:10:47,081 --> 01:10:48,951
And I had no idea where you were.

676
01:10:49,051 --> 01:10:51,831
I'll inform MI6 of the completion
secret service.

677
01:10:51,931 --> 01:10:54,111
You'll have your money and your life.

678
01:10:54,211 --> 01:10:56,241
Don't waste it.

679
01:10:56,761 --> 01:10:59,431
Darling Croft, this is no time to split off.

680
01:10:59,531 --> 01:11:03,526
Yes it is, before you
make the wrong decision.

681
01:11:07,321 --> 01:11:10,041
Okay you want to leave, go ahead.

682
01:11:10,201 --> 01:11:13,686
But don't pretend this to try and save me.

683
01:11:14,041 --> 01:11:16,791
You're afraid,
afraid you might not pull the trigger.

684
01:11:16,891 --> 01:11:18,471
Afraid of letting your guard down,

685
01:11:18,571 --> 01:11:20,611
of letting anyone in.

686
01:11:25,841 --> 01:11:28,461
I'm not leaving because I couldn't kill you.

687
01:11:28,561 --> 01:11:30,941
I'm leaving because I could.

688
01:12:17,561 --> 01:12:20,441
May I borrow your TV?

689
01:12:20,961 --> 01:12:22,821
It's important.

690
01:12:22,921 --> 01:12:23,941
Okay.

691
01:12:24,041 --> 01:12:25,661
Thanks.

692
01:12:25,761 --> 01:12:27,761
Lovely.

693
01:12:42,881 --> 01:12:44,391
the music is not the best...

694
01:12:44,491 --> 01:12:48,231
...save the best for the last.

695
01:12:48,331 --> 01:12:49,191
the funniest thing is the
best day of your life...

696
01:12:49,291 --> 01:12:52,351
...becomes the best day of your life.

697
01:13:29,921 --> 01:13:31,031
Hello, Bryce.

698
01:13:31,131 --> 01:13:32,181
Hello.

699
01:13:32,281 --> 01:13:34,141
Are you ready?

700
01:13:34,241 --> 01:13:35,421
Yeap.

701
01:13:35,521 --> 01:13:36,111
Right.

702
01:13:36,211 --> 01:13:40,121
Sending the last images of the orb, now.

703
01:13:45,241 --> 01:13:47,241
Got them.

704
01:13:50,681 --> 01:13:52,681
Translating.

705
01:13:52,881 --> 01:13:54,881
Done.

706
01:13:56,641 --> 01:13:58,641
Send the sounds.

707
01:13:59,441 --> 01:14:01,521
Sending it...now.

708
01:14:10,881 --> 01:14:12,881
No, nothing.

709
01:14:14,281 --> 01:14:17,256
Oh, well, back to the drawing board.

710
01:14:18,041 --> 01:14:20,611
No. Wait. The time's being distorted.

711
01:14:20,711 --> 01:14:22,181
Send me the file.

712
01:14:22,281 --> 01:14:26,231
Look Lara, I really don't think
that's going to work, you know. It's...

713
01:14:26,331 --> 01:14:27,581
Yes, of course, it will.

714
01:14:27,681 --> 01:14:29,151
You ever heard your voice
on the tape recorder?

715
01:14:29,251 --> 01:14:31,251
Same thing.

716
01:14:31,841 --> 01:14:33,621
Why are we having this discussion?

717
01:14:33,721 --> 01:14:35,721
Send me the file.

718
01:15:45,241 --> 01:15:47,241
Lara.

719
01:15:48,521 --> 01:15:50,521
Lara.

720
01:15:50,881 --> 01:15:52,881
Africa, it's in Africa.

721
01:15:52,881 --> 01:15:55,006
Somewhere in Kilimanjaro.

722
01:15:55,281 --> 01:15:56,901
Right now.

723
01:15:57,001 --> 01:15:59,471
How long would it take Reiss to
put his computer back together?

724
01:15:59,571 --> 01:16:01,181
24 hours at the fastest.

725
01:16:01,281 --> 01:16:02,471
Get in touch with Kosa.

726
01:16:02,571 --> 01:16:04,941
Ask him to get the car,
meet me North of his village.

727
01:16:05,041 --> 01:16:08,281
at 0800 hours. Bye then.

728
01:16:10,881 --> 01:16:13,176
A bit faster than 24 hours.

729
01:16:13,441 --> 01:16:15,441
Out.

730
01:16:19,441 --> 01:16:21,441
Africa it is.

731
01:16:38,761 --> 01:16:38,991
Kosa.

732
01:16:39,091 --> 01:16:39,911
Lara.

733
01:16:40,011 --> 01:16:40,911
How are you?

734
01:16:41,011 --> 01:16:41,631
Lara?.

735
01:16:41,731 --> 01:16:43,071
You had the jeep cleaned.

736
01:16:43,171 --> 01:16:44,151
Of course.

737
01:16:44,251 --> 01:16:46,341
I know how you like your equipment!

738
01:16:46,441 --> 01:16:48,221
Where are you? I can't see you.

739
01:16:48,321 --> 01:16:50,531
Don't worry I can see you.

740
01:16:50,921 --> 01:16:52,581
Okay, where are you coming from now?

741
01:16:52,681 --> 01:16:55,826
Keep going straight, 
keep your speed steady.

742
01:17:00,761 --> 01:17:02,761
Lara, welcome back.

743
01:17:08,801 --> 01:17:10,621
Do you ever do anything the easy way?

744
01:17:10,721 --> 01:17:13,016
And risk disappointing you?

745
01:17:19,681 --> 01:17:24,526
I've lost my friend and
I'm not sure where I can find her.

746
01:17:27,201 --> 01:17:28,031
Nice shirt.

747
01:17:28,131 --> 01:17:29,101
Ni hao.

748
01:17:29,201 --> 01:17:33,026
She went to Africa playing
with the elephants.

749
01:17:47,201 --> 01:17:49,981
Kosa, we've never been here, have we?

750
01:17:50,081 --> 01:17:53,481
We didn't come to this area before, why?

751
01:17:53,521 --> 01:17:55,661
Because I've seen that mountain before.

752
01:17:55,761 --> 01:17:57,661
The box is there somewhere.

753
01:17:57,761 --> 01:17:59,941
The locals call it the Mountain of God.

754
01:18:00,041 --> 01:18:02,231
There's a tribe that makes
a home on it...

755
01:18:02,331 --> 01:18:04,331
...that might help us.

756
01:18:46,841 --> 01:18:48,966
Leave the subject and go.

757
01:18:49,201 --> 01:18:51,241
Leave the subject and go.

758
01:18:51,401 --> 01:18:52,901
Never speak of it.

759
01:18:53,001 --> 01:18:54,951
To trespass on the Cradle of Life...

760
01:18:55,051 --> 01:18:58,781
...is to risk flooding the entire world with death.

761
01:18:58,881 --> 01:19:01,091
Men are coming for the box.

762
01:19:01,361 --> 01:19:05,221
Now unlike me, they won't look at it
with fear or respect.

763
01:19:05,321 --> 01:19:08,021
They would open, they want to use it.

764
01:19:08,121 --> 01:19:13,261
I'm sorry if I have to disturb your god
to keep this from happening.

765
01:19:13,361 --> 01:19:15,486
I will do whatever I must.

766
01:19:26,921 --> 01:19:30,406
Do you truly understand
what you're doing?

767
01:19:31,601 --> 01:19:36,021
Are you truly prepare
for what you're about to learn?

768
01:19:37,121 --> 01:19:39,926
Some secrets must remain secrets.

769
01:19:40,801 --> 01:19:44,966
These are very heavy burdens,
very lonely burdens.

770
01:19:47,841 --> 01:19:49,181
that if you find the box...

771
01:19:49,281 --> 01:19:51,916
...you would have to carry them.

772
01:19:57,201 --> 01:19:58,111
He warn you that...

773
01:19:58,211 --> 01:20:01,821
...no one who has gone looking
for the box has come back.

774
01:20:01,921 --> 01:20:06,191
Says the land beyond the canyon
belongs to the Shadow Guardians.

775
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:08,000
Shadow Guardians?!

776
01:20:10,001 --> 01:20:12,001
They do not sleep.

777
01:20:12,121 --> 01:20:16,121
They never rest.
They move like the wind.

778
01:20:18,401 --> 01:20:22,101
And anything that
walks their land will die.

779
01:20:22,201 --> 01:20:24,201
And the Cradle itself?

780
01:20:26,961 --> 01:20:29,061
Only with the orb can it be revealed.

781
01:20:29,161 --> 01:20:31,941
Inside, you will find a place of madness.

782
01:20:32,041 --> 01:20:36,251
Sky and Earth are one.
Direction, meaningless.

783
01:20:41,081 --> 01:20:44,901
He's going to give us 20 men
to take us as far as they can,

784
01:20:45,001 --> 01:20:46,501
to the Cradle of Life,

785
01:20:46,601 --> 01:20:48,641
where the box is hidden.

786
01:20:53,241 --> 01:20:55,241
We're getting closer.

787
01:21:00,121 --> 01:21:01,421
He said you were right.

788
01:21:01,521 --> 01:21:04,921
The Cradle of Life lies near the summit.

789
01:21:05,441 --> 01:21:07,621
He wants to know how you knew.

790
01:21:07,721 --> 01:21:09,721
The orb.

791
01:21:14,361 --> 01:21:16,371
He says, he would not
turn back with the others.

792
01:21:16,471 --> 01:21:18,851
He would go as far as we go.

793
01:21:20,001 --> 01:21:22,021
We will find the Shadow Guardians.

794
01:21:22,121 --> 01:21:23,461
dunka sana.

795
01:21:23,561 --> 01:21:25,561
You're very brave man.

796
01:21:27,801 --> 01:21:30,561
He said your accent is funny.

797
01:22:03,841 --> 01:22:05,841
Get down.

798
01:22:07,121 --> 01:22:09,121
Get down.

799
01:22:10,881 --> 01:22:11,861
Chinese. (African).

800
01:22:11,961 --> 01:22:13,961
Back.

801
01:22:25,161 --> 01:22:27,161
Back.

802
01:22:43,601 --> 01:22:45,631
Thank you Lara, for leading us here,

803
01:22:45,731 --> 01:22:47,991
and for finding the orb, in the first place.

804
01:22:48,091 --> 01:22:53,991
However, you have seen the exact position.
You could save me hours, days even.

805
01:22:54,091 --> 01:22:57,831
Help me, and I'll make
you worth your while.

806
01:22:58,641 --> 01:22:59,631
No.

807
01:22:59,731 --> 01:23:03,386
Think of what I'm offering you, let her go.

808
01:23:04,761 --> 01:23:07,591
The chance to find out,
how it all began,

809
01:23:07,691 --> 01:23:10,751
life line, the origin what we are...

810
01:23:11,121 --> 01:23:14,181
...don't tell me you're not tempted.

811
01:23:15,241 --> 01:23:17,876
That's like a Pandoran trouble.

812
01:23:17,921 --> 01:23:20,421
They told me you wouldn't do it.

813
01:23:20,521 --> 01:23:26,301
And I told them you would
rather than lose two of your closet friends.

814
01:23:27,001 --> 01:23:28,781
There goes the Cradle of Life.

815
01:23:28,881 --> 01:23:30,881
Sorry, Lara.

816
01:23:31,321 --> 01:23:34,636
It's your destiny to see what's inside.

817
01:23:35,801 --> 01:23:39,626
He's right, it's just beyond
the canyon, remember?

818
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,654
Such a short walk
might save your friends.

819
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:51,500
Well, if it spares my friends...
I'm up for a walk.

820
01:24:25,681 --> 01:24:27,231
I'm sure she'd understand.
Do you have a plan?

821
01:24:27,331 --> 01:24:29,351
You should've just told Lara
we were hostage.

822
01:24:29,451 --> 01:24:32,256
Reiss would never have found out.

823
01:24:45,241 --> 01:24:50,021
I don't suppose either of you
know how to fly a helicopter?

824
01:24:50,121 --> 01:24:51,661
I can.

825
01:24:51,761 --> 01:24:52,591
What?

826
01:24:52,691 --> 01:24:54,581
What?

827
01:24:54,681 --> 01:24:59,961
I've got over 150 hours between flight 
simulation...games,... models...

828
01:25:00,521 --> 01:25:02,816
...and then the real thing?

829
01:25:03,561 --> 01:25:04,421
Two.

830
01:25:04,521 --> 01:25:09,231
Two? well, you're only gonna fly it once I'm out,
so remember your two hours well!

831
01:25:09,331 --> 01:25:12,731
I hope you remember your two hours well.

832
01:25:44,161 --> 01:25:46,841
- It's through here? 
- Um.

833
01:25:48,601 --> 01:25:50,601
Move, baby.

834
01:27:15,881 --> 01:27:17,881
What's that?

835
01:27:18,441 --> 01:27:20,441
You. Check it out.

836
01:27:24,241 --> 01:27:26,241
Keep moving.

837
01:28:09,041 --> 01:28:10,221
What are you doing?

838
01:28:10,321 --> 01:28:12,321
Back in formation, now.

839
01:29:02,721 --> 01:29:04,721
Holy shit.

840
01:29:05,641 --> 01:29:08,871
Don't. They seem to react to movement.

841
01:29:26,361 --> 01:29:28,361
They're gone.

842
01:29:30,561 --> 01:29:33,381
I know we're close, I've seen it in your eyes.

843
01:29:33,481 --> 01:29:35,471
Take me to Pandora's Box.

844
01:29:35,571 --> 01:29:37,181
I don't know how.

845
01:29:37,281 --> 01:29:39,281
Do it now.

846
01:29:40,761 --> 01:29:44,301
Well you were the one who
wanted to go for a walk.

847
01:29:44,401 --> 01:29:46,401
So start walking.

848
01:29:52,161 --> 01:29:54,541
The next one will be higher.

849
01:30:31,241 --> 01:30:34,386
only with the orb can it be revealed.

850
01:30:35,561 --> 01:30:38,706
only with the orb can it be revealed.

851
01:30:41,881 --> 01:30:44,346
All right, I'll need the orb.

852
01:30:45,761 --> 01:30:48,981
Do you want to see
the Cradle of Life or not?

853
01:30:49,081 --> 01:30:51,716
You tell me what to do with it.

854
01:31:46,801 --> 01:31:49,181
Don't think you could outwit me, Croft.

855
01:31:49,281 --> 01:31:51,281
Oh, do shut up.

856
01:31:53,081 --> 01:31:55,631
So this is the Cradle of Life.

857
01:32:03,201 --> 01:32:05,201
Here they are.

858
01:32:06,161 --> 01:32:08,966
It's all yours.  Time to be a hero.

859
01:33:10,481 --> 01:33:12,481
There it is.

860
01:33:23,281 --> 01:33:25,021
Perfect, isn't it?

861
01:33:25,121 --> 01:33:27,871
All that power in such a banal container.

862
01:33:27,971 --> 01:33:30,991
Legend tells it when Pandora
saw inside the box...

863
01:33:31,091 --> 01:33:34,021
...she cried a pool of a black acid for tears...

864
01:33:34,121 --> 01:33:37,521
...and, as it was a woman
who found the box,...

865
01:33:37,521 --> 01:33:40,921
...I see no reason to break with tradition.

866
01:33:40,961 --> 01:33:43,596
A woman should collect the box.

867
01:33:45,641 --> 01:33:47,641
Go on.

868
01:33:50,481 --> 01:33:52,606
It's impossible to reach.

869
01:33:54,481 --> 01:33:56,481
Now, take it.

870
01:33:57,361 --> 01:33:59,361
Take it.

871
01:35:25,401 --> 01:35:27,441
I don't think so, Reiss.

872
01:36:20,321 --> 01:36:22,321
Are you okay?

873
01:36:22,641 --> 01:36:25,161
- I'm fine, fine. 
- There you go.

874
01:36:32,281 --> 01:36:34,061
You've come prepared.

875
01:36:34,161 --> 01:36:36,881
Well, I know how clumsy you are.

876
01:36:40,241 --> 01:36:42,451
How are Hillary and Bryce?

877
01:36:43,481 --> 01:36:45,481
They are fighting.

878
01:36:59,361 --> 01:37:01,181
Thank you.

879
01:37:01,281 --> 01:37:03,101
What was that?

880
01:37:03,201 --> 01:37:05,201
Oh.

881
01:37:06,001 --> 01:37:08,001
Thank you.

882
01:37:19,721 --> 01:37:21,721
Let's get out of here.

883
01:37:31,641 --> 01:37:33,641
Terry.

884
01:37:34,081 --> 01:37:36,081
What are you doing?

885
01:37:36,121 --> 01:37:38,416
Well, you're joking, right?

886
01:37:39,281 --> 01:37:42,596
We're taking this with us,
this is ours.

887
01:37:43,561 --> 01:37:47,301
You're not walking out of here
with that box.

888
01:37:48,081 --> 01:37:51,111
So, what are you saying,
we'll just leave it?

889
01:37:51,211 --> 01:37:52,771
Well, it's worth a fortune.

890
01:37:52,871 --> 01:37:55,761
Put it back.
- No, I don't think so.

891
01:37:55,921 --> 01:37:58,831
It could kill millions of innocent people.

892
01:37:58,931 --> 01:38:00,391
Now you're being romantic.

893
01:38:00,491 --> 01:38:03,361
Put it back.
- No.

894
01:38:06,081 --> 01:38:09,501
I've helped you keep this away from Reiss.

895
01:38:09,601 --> 01:38:11,601
This is my reward.

896
01:38:12,081 --> 01:38:14,361
I'm taking it with me.

897
01:38:24,281 --> 01:38:26,661
So it's come to this, has it?

898
01:38:26,761 --> 01:38:30,331
Well you do have authorization to kill me.

899
01:38:31,761 --> 01:38:33,581
You'd better do it, then.

900
01:38:33,681 --> 01:38:39,291
'Cause if you think standing
in front of me is gonna be enough...

901
01:38:41,001 --> 01:38:44,061
You don't have it in you to stop me.

902
01:38:51,961 --> 01:38:54,171
See, all your beliefs...

903
01:38:54,921 --> 01:38:56,921
...all your ideals,...

904
01:38:57,721 --> 01:38:59,721
They're not real.

905
01:38:59,761 --> 01:39:00,861
I am.

906
01:39:00,961 --> 01:39:02,961
And you've loved me.

907
01:39:06,401 --> 01:39:08,351
I don't know how strong you think you are...

908
01:39:08,451 --> 01:39:12,361
...but you're not going
to choose them over me.

909
01:39:15,521 --> 01:39:17,101
No move?

910
01:39:17,201 --> 01:39:19,201
No.

911
01:39:21,801 --> 01:39:23,801
Thanks.

912
01:41:44,961 --> 01:41:46,961
The box is safe now.

913
01:41:49,521 --> 01:41:52,751
Some things are not meant to be found.

914
01:42:02,441 --> 01:42:05,221
Did you ever do anything the easy way?

915
01:42:05,321 --> 01:42:08,211
I wouldn't want to disappoint you.

916
01:42:31,881 --> 01:42:32,911
Larie, are you okay?

917
01:42:33,011 --> 01:42:34,261
Lara, are you all right?

918
01:42:34,361 --> 01:42:36,921
This is...very touching.

919
01:42:37,321 --> 01:42:41,672
You know us, always making
friends, having a laugh.

920
01:42:41,772 --> 01:42:43,772
getting married.

921
01:42:44,401 --> 01:42:46,401
What?

922
01:42:46,881 --> 01:42:50,421
This is a wedding ceremony,
and you are the grooms.

923
01:42:50,521 --> 01:42:52,521
Good luck, boys.

924
01:42:52,961 --> 01:42:55,001
Sanke, Asante.

925
01:42:55,521 --> 01:42:57,761
Asante, asante.

926
01:43:09,201 --> 01:43:11,201
Go.
