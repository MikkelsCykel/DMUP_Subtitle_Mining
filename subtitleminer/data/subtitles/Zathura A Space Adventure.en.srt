1
00:02:50,469 --> 00:02:52,061
Oh, man.

2
00:02:57,109 --> 00:02:58,872
That's it.

3
00:03:00,979 --> 00:03:02,947
Nice grab.

4
00:03:05,884 --> 00:03:07,511
Oh, yeah.

5
00:03:10,255 --> 00:03:13,088
- All right, Danny, your turn.
- What? I didn't get my full turn.

6
00:03:13,258 --> 00:03:15,749
You did. I counted.
That was 25. That's what we said.

7
00:03:15,928 --> 00:03:17,657
- That's not fair.
- It's exactly fair.

8
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:21,095
Come on, Danny. Time for your turn,
then I gotta work for an hour.

9
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,895
You know, you're not the only one
who gets a turn.

10
00:03:24,336 --> 00:03:25,769
"The only one who gets a turn."

11
00:03:25,938 --> 00:03:27,371
Guys.

12
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,339
All right.

13
00:03:30,242 --> 00:03:34,076
Keep your eye on the ball.
You got it this time. Ready?

14
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:40,208
All right, that's a good try.
It was a bad throw. It's a bad throw.

15
00:03:40,385 --> 00:03:43,115
Sorry. My bad.

16
00:03:44,456 --> 00:03:47,254
Okay. Here we go.
You can do this.

17
00:03:47,426 --> 00:03:49,656
Here we go. Ready?

18
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:52,057
Okay.

19
00:03:52,231 --> 00:03:54,995
A deep fly ball to the right field.

20
00:03:55,167 --> 00:03:58,068
Clemente back,
running on his horse real fast.

21
00:03:58,237 --> 00:04:00,102
Can he get it? Can he get it?

22
00:04:00,272 --> 00:04:03,400
Oh, and Milton Bradley with
his dive-and-roll catch.

23
00:04:03,809 --> 00:04:06,744
- Dodgers win.
- You're such a dick.

24
00:04:10,749 --> 00:04:13,183
What? It was a great grab.

25
00:04:15,287 --> 00:04:16,948
Danny?

26
00:04:19,658 --> 00:04:21,421
Danny?

27
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:36,605
Danny, you should not be using that
kind of language with your brother.

28
00:04:36,775 --> 00:04:38,743
But it's true.

29
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:42,247
Listen, kiddo,
when I was 6 years old...

30
00:04:42,414 --> 00:04:45,076
- Six and three quarters.
- When I was 6 and three quarters...

31
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,445
...catching was hard for me too.

32
00:04:47,619 --> 00:04:49,610
Well, it's not hard for Walter.

33
00:04:49,788 --> 00:04:51,346
Well, Walter's 10.

34
00:04:51,523 --> 00:04:53,718
So? He's still better than me
at everything.

35
00:04:53,892 --> 00:04:56,986
No way.
He's not better than you at piano.

36
00:04:57,162 --> 00:04:59,221
I hate that stupid thing.

37
00:05:01,033 --> 00:05:03,866
Someday you're gonna be
really happy I got you that piano.

38
00:05:04,036 --> 00:05:06,163
You'll be at a party,
there'll be a pretty girl...

39
00:05:06,338 --> 00:05:08,306
Like you and Mom?

40
00:05:13,912 --> 00:05:15,846
Look, Danny...

41
00:05:16,281 --> 00:05:17,976
...you and Walter
are different people.

42
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:22,246
He's good at some things, you're good
at other things. That's how people are.

43
00:05:22,554 --> 00:05:24,749
He beats me at everything.

44
00:05:24,923 --> 00:05:27,551
Listen to me, this is important.

45
00:05:27,726 --> 00:05:30,286
You're a very special kid.

46
00:05:31,063 --> 00:05:34,760
That's what people say
when they can't think of anything.

47
00:05:34,933 --> 00:05:36,833
You know how you always
make up games...

48
00:05:37,002 --> 00:05:39,493
...and pretend to be characters?

49
00:05:39,671 --> 00:05:42,538
You have an incredible imagination.

50
00:05:43,508 --> 00:05:48,070
Amazing imagination.
A whole universe of an imagination.

51
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:52,741
And I use my imagination for a living,
so I know what I'm talking about.

52
00:05:53,552 --> 00:05:57,283
- Is it better than Walter's?
- What?

53
00:05:57,456 --> 00:06:00,823
Is my imagination better
than Walter's?

54
00:06:05,964 --> 00:06:07,795
You're different than Walter.

55
00:06:15,273 --> 00:06:16,934
- Don't do that.
- You wanna play catch?

56
00:06:17,109 --> 00:06:19,100
- We just played catch.
- No, football catch.

57
00:06:19,277 --> 00:06:20,710
I have to work for an hour.

58
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:24,178
- But it's Saturday.
- Tell me about it.

59
00:06:27,119 --> 00:06:29,314
- All you ever do is work.
- Nice try.

60
00:06:29,488 --> 00:06:31,422
- This is so unfair.
- Hello.

61
00:06:32,157 --> 00:06:33,454
Bill, I am so sorry.

62
00:06:33,825 --> 00:06:36,487
I'll call you back in two minutes.
Is that okay?

63
00:06:36,661 --> 00:06:37,889
Thanks.

64
00:06:39,097 --> 00:06:40,997
I have an important meeting
this afternoon.

65
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:44,260
- I've... I really have to be ready for it.
- You're going out?

66
00:06:44,436 --> 00:06:47,030
Yes, I'm going out.
Well, I'm going to a meeting.

67
00:06:47,205 --> 00:06:50,072
You're gonna be at Mom's house.
She's coming to get you at 3.

68
00:06:50,242 --> 00:06:51,573
We go to Mom's house tomorrow.

69
00:06:51,743 --> 00:06:53,938
- No, today.
- This is a four-day Dad week.

70
00:06:54,112 --> 00:06:55,909
Three-day Dad week.
Four-day last week...

71
00:06:56,081 --> 00:06:57,742
...four-day next week,
three-day this week.

72
00:06:57,916 --> 00:06:59,543
Four-day Mom week this week.

73
00:06:59,718 --> 00:07:01,447
But that's not fair.

74
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,315
- To whom?
- To anyone.

75
00:07:03,488 --> 00:07:04,648
I have to work.

76
00:07:05,557 --> 00:07:07,650
We'd have all the time
if Danny wasn't around.

77
00:07:07,826 --> 00:07:09,726
Well, Danny is around.

78
00:07:10,529 --> 00:07:13,020
All right, five throws.

79
00:07:13,198 --> 00:07:16,224
How do I put this? Let me think.
I have to work.

80
00:07:17,135 --> 00:07:19,160
Dad, I'm ready to play
"Smash Bros."

81
00:07:19,337 --> 00:07:20,998
You told him you'd play
"Smash Bros."?

82
00:07:21,173 --> 00:07:23,505
No, I didn't tell him I was gonna
play "Smash Bros."

83
00:07:23,975 --> 00:07:26,944
- You're playing catch with Walter?
- He might if you weren't around.

84
00:07:27,112 --> 00:07:29,376
You're so mean.
Everybody wants to ruin my life.

85
00:07:29,548 --> 00:07:31,345
You never keep your promises.

86
00:07:31,516 --> 00:07:33,108
There's only one of me, okay?

87
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,820
I don't like this situation either,
it sucks, is what it does...

88
00:07:36,988 --> 00:07:39,013
...but this is the best I could
come up with.

89
00:07:39,191 --> 00:07:43,218
So climb off my back and give me
about two inches of space, will you?

90
00:08:00,345 --> 00:08:05,681
There are some days, boys,
when you gotta grow up all at once.

91
00:08:05,851 --> 00:08:08,718
I need today to be
one of those days.

92
00:08:17,262 --> 00:08:19,321
Wanna play Chutes and Ladders?

93
00:08:20,465 --> 00:08:21,727
No, you'll cheat.

94
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,595
Stratego?

95
00:08:24,536 --> 00:08:26,265
No, you cheat at board games.

96
00:08:26,438 --> 00:08:28,906
But you can't even cheat at Stratego.

97
00:08:29,074 --> 00:08:30,701
Trust me, you'll find a way.

98
00:08:30,876 --> 00:08:33,242
Hey. Sorry about that.

99
00:08:33,411 --> 00:08:34,776
Oh, no, no, it's fine.

100
00:08:34,946 --> 00:08:37,346
I'm not meeting him till 3:30,
I can finish by then.

101
00:08:37,516 --> 00:08:39,177
Walter, look what I found.

102
00:08:39,351 --> 00:08:41,285
Those belong to me. Put them back.

103
00:08:41,453 --> 00:08:43,387
But you never play with them.

104
00:08:43,555 --> 00:08:45,352
So? They're still mine.

105
00:08:45,524 --> 00:08:47,617
When did you get so mean?

106
00:08:47,792 --> 00:08:49,191
I'm not mean, Danny.

107
00:08:49,361 --> 00:08:51,591
I'm in fourth grade,
I have a girlfriend.

108
00:08:51,763 --> 00:08:53,594
You know how Dad said
we have to grow up?

109
00:08:53,765 --> 00:08:55,426
Well, this is what it looks like.

110
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,296
Can we please play "Army Men"?

111
00:09:03,008 --> 00:09:04,236
Copy that.

112
00:09:04,409 --> 00:09:07,867
Sergeant, there is a helicopter on fire.
Let's get it.

113
00:09:08,046 --> 00:09:09,980
The drawings all match
the foam mockup.

114
00:09:10,148 --> 00:09:11,547
- Get back here.
- Let me hold it.

115
00:09:11,716 --> 00:09:13,707
- Yes, red.
- Give me.

116
00:09:13,885 --> 00:09:16,217
Cranberry, right.
It's whatever color they picked.

117
00:09:16,388 --> 00:09:17,650
I worked from the chits.

118
00:09:17,822 --> 00:09:22,316
Can I call you back one more time?
It's a small domestic emergency here.

119
00:09:22,494 --> 00:09:24,052
I... I... I know. I know.

120
00:09:24,229 --> 00:09:26,789
- Dad.
- It's not a problem. Okay, thanks.

121
00:09:26,965 --> 00:09:28,956
- Look what he did.
- I was on the phone.

122
00:09:29,134 --> 00:09:31,466
- It was an accident.
- You're such a baby.

123
00:09:31,636 --> 00:09:33,570
- I'm not a baby.
- You break all my stuff.

124
00:09:33,738 --> 00:09:35,569
- You can't catch a ball...
- That's enough.

125
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,901
...and nobody wants you around.
- You shut up!

126
00:09:41,746 --> 00:09:43,839
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

127
00:09:44,015 --> 00:09:45,175
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

128
00:09:48,386 --> 00:09:50,047
It's 10 minutes to the office.

129
00:09:50,221 --> 00:09:52,212
I have to run off another copy.
I'll be back.

130
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:54,984
You're gonna leave us alone
in this creepy old house?

131
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,321
- It's not creepy, it's old.
- I like Mom's better.

132
00:09:57,495 --> 00:09:59,429
Well, so did she, and now it's hers.

133
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:08,032
Look, this is a very special house.

134
00:10:08,206 --> 00:10:12,404
The reason I'm working to fix it up
is I wanna make a home for us here.

135
00:10:12,577 --> 00:10:15,603
Now, I know it's not Mom's house,
and I know it's a little creaky...

136
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,442
...but give it some time,
it's gonna grow on you.

137
00:10:18,617 --> 00:10:20,209
Well, I don't wanna stay here alone.

138
00:10:20,385 --> 00:10:23,616
Well, you're not gonna be alone.
I'm going to wake up Lisa.

139
00:10:23,788 --> 00:10:25,847
- No, don't wake up Lisa.
- What, are you crazy?

140
00:10:26,024 --> 00:10:27,958
She's sleeping. Let her sleep.

141
00:10:29,194 --> 00:10:30,559
Honey.

142
00:10:31,496 --> 00:10:33,020
Lisa. Honey.

143
00:10:33,632 --> 00:10:34,792
Get up.

144
00:10:34,966 --> 00:10:39,027
I need to go out. I need you to
look after your two favorite people.

145
00:10:39,971 --> 00:10:41,598
Come on.

146
00:10:43,642 --> 00:10:46,202
I can't. I have a date tonight.

147
00:10:46,378 --> 00:10:47,936
What time?

148
00:10:48,346 --> 00:10:50,143
We're hooking up at, like, 8.

149
00:10:51,082 --> 00:10:53,744
- It's 2.
- So?

150
00:10:53,918 --> 00:10:56,512
- So that's six hours from now.
- What's your point?

151
00:10:56,688 --> 00:10:58,053
I need you to look after the boys.

152
00:10:58,223 --> 00:11:01,056
By the way, it makes me uncomfortable
when you say "hooking up."

153
00:11:01,226 --> 00:11:04,252
Why? It's not like it means anything.

154
00:11:04,429 --> 00:11:06,897
- Hope it doesn't.
- It doesn't. It's just an expression.

155
00:11:07,065 --> 00:11:09,829
- Hope it is.

156
00:11:10,001 --> 00:11:12,060
We never should have
rented <i>Thirteen</i>.

157
00:11:12,237 --> 00:11:15,104
Keep your eye on them. Make sure
they don't burn down the house.

158
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:18,536
- Okay?
- I'm not deaf.

159
00:11:19,277 --> 00:11:20,869
- I'm not deaf.
- What?

160
00:11:21,046 --> 00:11:22,308
Dad, okay.

161
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,005
Fifteen minutes, just close the door.

162
00:11:25,717 --> 00:11:27,776
Thank you.

163
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:43,259
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I am.

164
00:11:43,435 --> 00:11:45,130
Yeah, hold on.

165
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:10,990
Hey!

166
00:12:11,563 --> 00:12:12,996
Dad said no video games.

167
00:12:13,164 --> 00:12:15,291
He did not.

168
00:12:15,467 --> 00:12:17,435
Fine.

171
00:12:32,684 --> 00:12:34,447
I was watching that.

So, what do you want me
to do about it?

178
00:12:49,567 --> 00:12:51,296
Make me macaroni and cheese?

179
00:12:51,469 --> 00:12:52,697
I don't know how.

180
00:12:52,871 --> 00:12:54,862
I'm hungry.

192
00:13:54,599 --> 00:13:56,658
Danny?

193
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:00,965
Where are you?

194
00:14:04,976 --> 00:14:07,069
Danny?

195
00:14:09,047 --> 00:14:11,174

Danny?

197
00:14:17,789 --> 00:14:19,814
Where are you?

198
00:14:21,826 --> 00:14:24,056
- There you are.
- I said I was sorry.

199
00:14:24,863 --> 00:14:27,093
Don't. No.

200
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,767
- Don't do that, it's not funny.
- You'll be safe here till Dad gets back.

201
00:14:31,936 --> 00:14:35,872
You're just jealous because
Dad thinks I'm smarter than you.

202
00:14:36,808 --> 00:14:38,469
I didn't mean that.

203
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:44,872
Walter. No. Pull me up. Don't.

204
00:14:45,049 --> 00:14:46,311
What's the matter, Danny?

205
00:14:46,484 --> 00:14:49,112
Not still scared of the basement,
are you?

206
00:14:49,654 --> 00:14:52,214
Walter! No, Walter!

207
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:54,051
It's not funny! No!

208
00:14:56,261 --> 00:14:58,821
Pull me up! Walter!

209
00:14:58,997 --> 00:15:01,830
Three-year-olds
are scared of basements.

210
00:17:20,271 --> 00:17:22,239
You're really mean.

211
00:17:22,407 --> 00:17:25,069
Dad said not to play in there.

212
00:17:27,812 --> 00:17:30,508
Look what I found in the basement.

213
00:17:30,848 --> 00:17:32,782
Looks dumb and old.

214
00:17:33,217 --> 00:17:34,912
I like it.

215
00:17:35,086 --> 00:17:36,951
Yeah, you would, it's for babies.

216
00:17:43,461 --> 00:17:46,453
Walter, this is so cool.
Check this out.

217
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,770
What's Zathura?

218
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:12,980
- Will you play with me?
- No.

219
00:18:13,424 --> 00:18:15,858
- I won't cheat.
- Yeah, you will.

220
00:18:50,962 --> 00:18:53,522

- Fascinating.

"Meteor shower.

226
00:19:13,317 --> 00:19:14,841
What's evasive action?

227
00:19:15,019 --> 00:19:16,611
It's when you get out of the way.

228
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:20,155
What exactly am I supposed to
get out of the way of, exactly?

229
00:19:20,324 --> 00:19:23,384
I have no idea.
All it says is "Take evasive a..."

230

Take erasive action!

233
00:20:01,566 --> 00:20:04,228
Take erasive action!

234
00:20:28,993 --> 00:20:30,221
Danny, in here.

235
00:20:30,394 --> 00:20:31,725
Danny, hurry up. It's safe.

236
00:20:31,896 --> 00:20:33,261
Danny, come on. Hurry.

237
00:20:33,431 --> 00:20:34,898
Danny, come on, hurry up.

238
00:20:35,066 --> 00:20:38,433
Hurry, hurry, hurry.
Come on. Get in, get in.

241
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:25,741
I don't think we should play
that game anymore.

242
00:21:43,634 --> 00:21:44,862
That's weird.

243
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:48,000
It only hit the living room.

244
00:22:04,689 --> 00:22:07,624
Wow, outer space.

245
00:22:07,792 --> 00:22:09,350
No, that's just nighttime.

246
00:22:11,329 --> 00:22:15,163
I don't know, Walter.
Night never looked so close before.

247
00:22:22,406 --> 00:22:23,703
Wait.

248
00:22:28,913 --> 00:22:31,381
Walter, check this out.

249
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:01,635
- Tell her.
- You tell her.

250
00:24:01,806 --> 00:24:03,535
You should,
she won't freak out as much.

251
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:05,539
We shouldn't really even be in here.

252
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:07,803
Dude, we're in outer space.
It doesn't matter.

253
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:09,537
Then you wake her.

254
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:11,375
Fine.

255
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:13,982
Lisa.

256
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,519
Lisa. Lisa...

257
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:19,156
- Go away.
- Lisa, you gotta get up.

258
00:24:19,457 --> 00:24:21,152
What's the rule about
being in my room?

259
00:24:21,326 --> 00:24:23,317
We're not allowed in
unless it's an emergency.

260
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:25,360
And what's the emergency?

261
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:28,192
There was a meteor shower
and everything got wrecked.

262
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:30,357
- We can't get back to Earth.
- Okay, shut up!

263
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:32,526
- Just look.
- Yeah.

264
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,405
- Oh, no.
- What do we do?

265
00:24:37,575 --> 00:24:39,372
It's already dark?
I'm gonna be so late.

266
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:41,307
- It's not dark.
- We're in outer space.

267
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:43,913
I saw Saturn outside.

268
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:47,247
Lisa, open up.

269
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:49,512
Shut up and listen to me.

270
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:51,656
Dad put me in charge
until he got home.

271
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,688
Which means you guys
need to do what I say.

272
00:24:53,858 --> 00:24:56,486
Do me a favor. Go downstairs
and stay out of my face.

273
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:57,923
But it's an emergency.

274
00:24:58,096 --> 00:24:59,723
- Is the house on fire?
- No.

275
00:24:59,898 --> 00:25:01,422
- Is anyone hurt?
- No, but...

276
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:03,328
- Then leave.
- Lisa, please.

277
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:06,402
We're really scared. Can you just
watch what this game does?

278
00:25:09,407 --> 00:25:12,672
If this is some weird joke you guys
are trying to pull, you're dead.

279
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:14,141
No, it's not a joke.

280
00:25:14,312 --> 00:25:16,576
Here, watch this. Watch this. Here.

281
00:25:16,748 --> 00:25:20,184
- Okay. So wind the key.
- All right.

282
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,513
- So now I'm winding the key.
- Yeah, see?

283
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:24,712
- And then push the button.
- So I push it?

284
00:25:24,889 --> 00:25:26,151
- Yeah.
- Pushing the button.

285
00:25:26,324 --> 00:25:29,191
Then the number winds,
and whatever the number is, like nine.

286
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,056
Then your ship... The blue ship...

287
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:33,424
...because the red ship is mine,
and I got a five.

288
00:25:33,598 --> 00:25:37,193
So then it goes to nine,
which would be that thing.

289
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,303
- All right.
- Then the card's gonna pop out.

290
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:40,563
- The card.
- The card.

291
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:42,434
- The card!
- The card!

292
00:25:42,974 --> 00:25:44,601
- The card.
- Here's the scary part.

293
00:25:45,543 --> 00:25:47,272
"You're promoted to
a starship captain.

294
00:25:47,445 --> 00:25:48,912
Move ahead two spaces."

295
00:25:51,316 --> 00:25:52,544
Fascinating.

296
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:54,844
- Lisa, no, no! Lisa!
- No, wait, Lisa!

297
00:25:55,019 --> 00:25:58,079
Wait, that one didn't count.
Let me go. Let me go. Here. Okay.

298
00:26:01,126 --> 00:26:02,388
It's stuck.

299
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,461
Maybe we have to take turns.

300
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:07,656
See? It was my turn.

301
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,027
- Four.
- Yeah, four.

302
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:15,834
Card.

303
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,470
What the heck does that mean?

304
00:26:37,595 --> 00:26:39,119
Lisa?

305
00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:41,993
Does "cryonic" mean ice?

306
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:44,030
Lisa.

307
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:48,428
Help.

308
00:27:16,367 --> 00:27:18,028
I killed her.

309
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:19,602
You didn't kill her.

310
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:22,137
She's frozen in cryonic sleep.

311
00:27:24,375 --> 00:27:26,240
I gotta melt her.

312
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,428
Are you crazy?

313
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:46,393
We can't just leave her here
like this.

314
00:27:46,564 --> 00:27:49,089
Maybe we should read
the instructions.

315
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:56,867
"Zathura.
Attention, space adventurers.

316
00:27:57,041 --> 00:27:58,702
Zathura awaits.

00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:01,175
Do you have what it takes
to navigate the galaxy?

318
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:03,246
It's not for the faint of heart.

319
00:28:03,414 --> 00:28:05,143
For once you embark
upon your journey...

320
00:28:05,316 --> 00:28:07,614
...there's no turning back
until Zathura's reached.

321
00:28:07,785 --> 00:28:09,719
Pieces reset
at the end of each game.

322
00:28:09,888 --> 00:28:12,413
Play again and again
for different adventures."

323
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:15,184
That's it. We gotta keep playing.

324
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,225
I'm not playing that thing.

325
00:28:17,395 --> 00:28:19,863
Yes, we are.
It says we go home if we win.

326
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:21,862
It... It didn't say that.

327
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:24,797
Yes, it did. "Pieces reset
at the end of each game."

328
00:28:24,969 --> 00:28:26,800
That means we go home
when we're finished.

329
00:28:26,971 --> 00:28:30,737
All I know is that when we play
this game, bad things happen.

330
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:33,207
All I know is that when I played,
I got promoted.

331
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,141
So I'm gonna win this
and get us home.

332
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:37,076
- Wait, can we stop..?
- Don't be a baby.

333
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,545
I'm not a baby.

334
00:28:46,157 --> 00:28:47,784
Look, eight, I'm halfway there.

335
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:06,166
What does that mean?

336
00:29:06,344 --> 00:29:07,743
Means my robot's broken.

337
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:10,346
But you don't even have a robot.

338
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:39,907
<i>Emergency</i>.

339
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:41,306
<i>Emergency</i>.

340
00:29:48,586 --> 00:29:50,144
That's your robot?

341
00:29:50,321 --> 00:29:52,687
- At least I got one.
- Well, what does it do?

342
00:29:52,857 --> 00:29:56,315
Anything I want.
Get me a juice box, beyotch.

343
00:29:56,494 --> 00:29:58,655
- Don't do that.
- Why not? It's my robot.

344
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,798
- You might make it mad.
- It's 3 inches tall.

345
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:03,365
I'll punt it across the room.
My robot, the card says.

346
00:30:03,534 --> 00:30:06,594
I never said it wasn't your robot.
You don't have to be such a jerk.

347
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:09,205
Dude, you're just jealous
I have a robot and you don't.

348
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:11,535
- Why would I want..?
<i>- Emergency</i>.

349
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,343
<i>Emergency</i>.

350
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,455
<i>Alien life form</i>.

351
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:30,491
<i>Must destroy</i>.

352
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:33,426
Walter, I think he's talking
about you.

353
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,553
<i>Alien life form</i>.

354
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,624
<i>Must destroy</i>.

355
00:31:35,693 --> 00:31:38,287
Danny, take your turn.

356
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:50,200
- There's no key.
- Find it.

357
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,491
Take it, take it. Come on, hurry.

358
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:43,887
Take your turn!

359
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,214
Why didn't you go?
I could have been killed.

360
00:33:04,382 --> 00:33:07,510
I was scared. But it's okay,
he's gone, isn't he?

361
00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:55,789
Danny, take your turn.

362
00:34:07,778 --> 00:34:10,542
- Danny, give me the card.
- It's still moving.

363
00:34:13,784 --> 00:34:15,752
Hurry up, Danny.

364
00:34:17,421 --> 00:34:18,945
The card.

365
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:41,075
What did the card say?

366
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:28,823
Danny!

367
00:35:54,285 --> 00:35:55,513
Danny!

368
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:58,152
Walter!

369
00:36:48,073 --> 00:36:49,768
What?

370
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:57,043
- What happened?
- It's Lisa.

371
00:37:04,456 --> 00:37:06,924
Is she okay?

372
00:37:15,467 --> 00:37:18,493
Walter, do you think she's okay?

373
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:21,966
I guess. She's still in one piece.

374
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:24,766
What happened to the robot?

375
00:37:43,161 --> 00:37:44,651
What are you doing?

376
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:46,956
I think it's dead.

377
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:55,831
Get up here.

378
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:50,256
Do you think the door
will hold the robot?

379
00:38:50,428 --> 00:38:51,861
No.

380
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:54,424
Great.

381
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:58,865
Yeah, once he fixes himself,
we're screwed.

382
00:38:59,037 --> 00:39:00,629
He's fixing himself?

383
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:02,397
How should I know?

384
00:39:13,051 --> 00:39:14,678
Looks about right.

385
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:16,581
You think she's okay?

386
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:19,587
I don't wanna be here
when she wakes up.

387
00:39:19,757 --> 00:39:21,987
Where are you going?

388
00:39:23,895 --> 00:39:25,453
Taking my turn.

389
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:29,259
Are you crazy?
That thing's messed up.

390
00:39:32,804 --> 00:39:36,604
"You're promoted to fleet admiral.
Move ahead four spaces."

391
00:39:44,182 --> 00:39:48,175
- Okay, your turn.
- I'm not playing.

392
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:57,588
- What are you doing?
- Making mac and cheese.

393
00:39:59,196 --> 00:40:01,460
There's no water, dummy,
we're in outer space.

394
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:08,600
Why are you doing that?

395
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:11,871
Because I'm hungry and I know
you're not gonna take care of me.

396
00:40:12,476 --> 00:40:14,137
Don't bother, the gas won't work.

397
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:18,610
Any more advice?

398
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:21,217
You've gotta turn it up more.

399
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,250
Can we at least talk about this?

400
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,586
There's nothing to talk about,
I'm not going.

401
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:37,000
Danny, I just wanna go home,
and I can't unless you play.

402
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:39,867
Don't you wanna get home?

403
00:40:40,037 --> 00:40:41,664
What's so great
about home, anyway?

404
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:44,637
What do you mean? Everything
was great until you came along.

405
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:47,039
See? You treat me
like everything's my fault.

406
00:40:47,211 --> 00:40:49,873
You're the one who pushed the button
in the first place.

407
00:40:50,047 --> 00:40:53,312
I just wanted to play
a game with you, Walter.

408
00:40:54,151 --> 00:40:55,482
Fine, what do you want?

409
00:40:56,921 --> 00:41:00,015
I want you not to be mean to me,
not ignore me...

410
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:02,318
...and I want you to treat me
like your brother.

411
00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:05,394
- Fine.
- Do we have an understanding?

412
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:07,224
Yeah.

413
00:41:08,265 --> 00:41:09,994
Wasn't that easy?

414
00:41:22,713 --> 00:41:24,408
Six.

415
00:41:38,095 --> 00:41:40,063
What's a Zorgon?

416
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:43,564
I don't think it's bad. Just visitors.

417
00:42:07,124 --> 00:42:08,921
Zorgons!

418
00:42:47,998 --> 00:42:49,397
Maybe they're friendly.

419
00:42:52,937 --> 00:42:54,928
They're not friendly!

420
00:42:57,875 --> 00:43:01,140
The fireplace. Hide in the fireplace.

421
00:43:22,366 --> 00:43:23,856
Run!

422
00:43:37,314 --> 00:43:40,147
Told you I didn't wanna go.
You're the one who made me spin.

423
00:43:40,317 --> 00:43:41,978
There's nothing else we could do.

424
00:43:52,062 --> 00:43:54,656
- Are you crazy?
- Got any better ideas?

425
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:09,340
"Reprogram"?
What the heck does that mean?

426
00:44:09,513 --> 00:44:10,980
How am I supposed to know?

427
00:44:15,219 --> 00:44:16,550
Reprogram!

428
00:44:33,704 --> 00:44:35,729
It didn't work.

429
00:44:35,906 --> 00:44:37,373
We'll figure it out later.

430
00:44:45,115 --> 00:44:46,548
Go.

431
00:44:46,717 --> 00:44:48,514
- No.
- Go.

432
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,210
- No!
- Go!

433
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:15,808
"Rest on standing AstroTurf."

434
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,813
- What?
- Rest on standing AstroTurf.

435
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:22,181
- Let me read it.
- No, I know how to read.

436
00:45:22,352 --> 00:45:26,812
- I know how to read.
- Let me read it. God.

437
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:30,924
What stranded astronaut?

438
00:45:31,095 --> 00:45:34,428
I guess there's gonna be some
stranded astronaut or some...

439
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:06,893
Did you lock the door?

440
00:46:07,664 --> 00:46:09,029
I don't know.

441
00:46:57,614 --> 00:46:59,172
Which one of you spun me?

442
00:47:01,385 --> 00:47:04,582
- Who was it?
- Him.

443
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:07,517
Don't be so quick
to sell out your brother, kid.

444
00:47:07,691 --> 00:47:09,386
He's all you got.

445
00:47:13,864 --> 00:47:16,856
Looks like you got a pretty serious
Zorgon problem.

446
00:47:17,034 --> 00:47:18,331
Yeah, what do we do?

447
00:47:19,937 --> 00:47:21,598
- Hide.
- Hide?

448
00:47:21,772 --> 00:47:24,172
They'll just explode
the whole house.

449
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:26,874
We're gonna hide the house.

450
00:47:36,486 --> 00:47:38,920
Turn off all the lights
and electrical appliances.

451
00:47:39,089 --> 00:47:41,284
- Me?
- Yes, you. Go. Do it.

452
00:47:43,293 --> 00:47:44,760
Okay.

453
00:47:47,297 --> 00:47:49,288
You. Come on,
kill that flame on the stove.

454
00:47:49,466 --> 00:47:50,524
Okay.

455
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:02,812
Burning gas. That's probably what
brought them in the first place.

456
00:48:09,286 --> 00:48:12,255
Okay. Now get the pilot light
on the furnace.

457
00:48:12,589 --> 00:48:13,817
What's a pilot light?

458
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:18,927
In the basement.
Little blue flame under the big heater.

459
00:48:19,363 --> 00:48:21,661
Blow it out like a candle. Like this:

460
00:49:15,352 --> 00:49:19,379
Walter, the astronaut guy
is wrecking Dad's couch.

461
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:27,619
Come on.

462
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:35,195
That's Dad's nap couch.

463
00:49:49,886 --> 00:49:51,820
You wanna help me
get this out of here?

464
00:50:11,208 --> 00:50:13,005
Hit it.

465
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:14,643
Hit it.

466
00:50:14,811 --> 00:50:17,405
- What's happening?
- Come on.

467
00:50:17,581 --> 00:50:19,776
Take it.

468
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:21,713
Follow it.

469
00:50:21,885 --> 00:50:23,352
Follow it.

470
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,385
There you go.

471
00:50:29,059 --> 00:50:30,720
That's it.

472
00:50:39,236 --> 00:50:41,204
Zorgons.

473
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:43,498
They're big, gnarly lizards.

474
00:50:43,673 --> 00:50:45,732
Cold-blooded heatseekers.

475
00:50:46,576 --> 00:50:50,171
And the tiniest spark of warmth
will bring them in like moths.

476
00:50:50,347 --> 00:50:51,837
Flying all around the galaxy...

477
00:50:52,015 --> 00:50:54,313
...looking for anything
they could find to burn up.

478
00:50:54,651 --> 00:50:56,642
Why don't they just burn up
their own planet?

479
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:58,481
Oh, they already did.

480
00:50:58,655 --> 00:51:00,145
That's not even the worst of it.

481
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:03,860
The real problem
is their ravenous appetite.

482
00:51:04,027 --> 00:51:05,551
They never stop eating.

483
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:07,124
What do they eat?

484
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:10,590
- Meat.
- That's good.

485
00:51:11,802 --> 00:51:14,965
Dude, you're meat.

486
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:46,661
Are you doing this
to keep Zorgons away?

487
00:51:48,171 --> 00:51:49,763
Nope.

488
00:51:50,474 --> 00:51:54,103
I'm doing this because I've been
eating paste out of a tube for 15 years.

489
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:16,163
- This totally sucks.
- Why?

490
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:17,994
He's eating all our food.

491
00:52:18,168 --> 00:52:21,262
So? Lupe just went shopping.

492
00:52:21,438 --> 00:52:23,429
How long do you think
we're gonna be out here?

493
00:52:23,607 --> 00:52:25,268
It could be weeks. Then what?

494
00:52:25,442 --> 00:52:27,103
I don't know.

495
00:52:27,277 --> 00:52:30,576
What about air? How long is it gonna
last before he breathes it all up?

496
00:52:32,549 --> 00:52:35,109
- I guess.
- I'm gonna say something.

497
00:52:35,285 --> 00:52:38,015
No, wait. Walter. Walter.

498
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:42,351
Dude, that's our food.

499
00:52:42,926 --> 00:52:46,828
Yep. And you're running low
on supplies.

500
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:49,261
Yeah, I know. You're eating it all.

501
00:52:51,101 --> 00:52:55,094
Well, as I recall, the card said,
"Rescue stranded astronaut."

502
00:52:55,272 --> 00:52:58,036
Looks to me like I'm the only one
that's doing any rescuing...

503
00:52:58,208 --> 00:53:02,008
...so I don't think a couple Dagwood
sandwiches is too much to ask for.

504
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:04,472
Dog, you're eating it all.

505
00:53:06,383 --> 00:53:09,318
I passed through a time sphincter
to get here.

506
00:53:09,486 --> 00:53:11,283
You realize how difficult that is?

507
00:53:11,555 --> 00:53:13,022
What's a time sphincter?

508
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:16,250
A wormhole, about yay big:

509
00:53:16,826 --> 00:53:18,054
You squeeze through there...

510
00:53:18,228 --> 00:53:21,163
...and tell me you're not
hungry enough to eat a carpet shark.

511
00:53:21,932 --> 00:53:24,526
Sounds like you got a long trip
ahead of you.

512
00:53:25,669 --> 00:53:27,261
Oh, you telling me to leave?

513
00:53:27,437 --> 00:53:31,305
Well, I mean, once you get
finished eating, yeah.

514
00:53:32,175 --> 00:53:34,643
Oh, I hate to break it to you,
but that's not your call.

515
00:53:35,011 --> 00:53:38,105
He spun me, so it's up to him.

516
00:53:42,085 --> 00:53:44,781
Well, I'm fleet admiral,
and I'm telling you to hit the road.

517
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:53,420
I apologize, sir. I didn't... I didn't
realize you were a fleet admiral.

518
00:53:55,165 --> 00:53:56,792
In fact, I...

519
00:53:57,867 --> 00:53:59,164
I'm a fleet admiral too.

520
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:02,763
It's just a card, bug nuts.

521
00:54:03,773 --> 00:54:05,968
Well, he wants you to leave too.

522
00:54:06,142 --> 00:54:08,007
That true, Danny?
You want me to split?

523
00:54:08,178 --> 00:54:09,941
- Of course he does.
- Hey, mouthpiece...

524
00:54:10,113 --> 00:54:13,480
...let him answer, all right?
I need to hear it from the big guy.

525
00:54:14,484 --> 00:54:16,076
Well...

526
00:54:16,486 --> 00:54:18,249
Danny, tell him
you want him to leave.

527
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:21,481
Well, he did help out a little.

528
00:54:21,658 --> 00:54:24,627
Help? He burned our couch
and now he's eating all our food.

529
00:54:24,794 --> 00:54:26,091
You call that helping?

530
00:54:27,197 --> 00:54:29,097
You know what?

531
00:54:29,633 --> 00:54:32,761
I'm just gonna go.
I feel like a third wheel anyways.

532
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:36,269
I mean, you guys are such a tight,
unified team here.

533
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:41,809
You're doing great too. I gotta tell you,
the house looks fantastic.

534
00:54:41,978 --> 00:54:43,570
So I'll just get out of your hair...

535
00:54:43,747 --> 00:54:47,513
...and let you guys whomp
some more Zorgon butt without me.

536
00:54:47,751 --> 00:54:49,548
Wait.

537
00:54:49,719 --> 00:54:51,482
Whose brother are you,
his or mine?

538
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:04,628
You can stay.

539
00:55:08,271 --> 00:55:10,603
Orders are orders.

540
00:55:10,774 --> 00:55:13,641
Come on, admiral, your turn.

541
00:55:18,248 --> 00:55:20,478
- I'm sorry.
- Shut up.

542
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:21,878
I think he can help.

543
00:55:29,493 --> 00:55:32,951
Okay. Why haven't
you guys started yet?

544
00:55:33,129 --> 00:55:34,357
We're waiting for you.

545
00:55:34,531 --> 00:55:37,523
Okay, well, I'm here,
so turn that clockwise...

546
00:55:37,701 --> 00:55:40,534
- Yeah, I know how to play the game.
- Okay.

547
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:45,231
Hang on a second.
Something's wrong.

548
00:55:45,408 --> 00:55:46,397
What?

549
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:49,239
I was ahead of you.

550
00:55:50,981 --> 00:55:53,449
Somebody must have
kicked the board?

551
00:55:53,617 --> 00:55:54,982
No, nobody kicked the board.

552
00:55:55,151 --> 00:55:56,709
- You cheated.
- No, I didn't.

553
00:55:56,887 --> 00:55:58,684
You cheated.
I knew you were gonna cheat.

554
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:00,948
- "Cheater's" a strong word.
- I didn't cheat.

555
00:56:01,124 --> 00:56:03,251
- I didn't cheat!
- Guys, guys. Please.

556
00:56:03,426 --> 00:56:07,055
Bring it down. Indoor voices.
Now, did you move the piece?

557
00:56:08,698 --> 00:56:13,897
Maybe I moved the piece
by an accident.

558
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:15,867
Okay. It was an accident.

559
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:17,631
How can you move a piece
by accident?

560
00:56:17,807 --> 00:56:20,139
It's stuck to the game.
It's impossible. You cheated.

561
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:23,279
No, no, no, let's not use that word.
No, stop saying "cheated."

562
00:56:23,446 --> 00:56:26,142
- You cheated! Cheater!
- I didn't cheat!

563
00:56:26,316 --> 00:56:30,309
Come on. Okay?
Now, where did you move from?

564
00:56:30,487 --> 00:56:32,455
I was right here.

565
00:56:32,622 --> 00:56:35,648
No, you weren't.
You were back there.

566
00:56:35,825 --> 00:56:37,588
Okay.

567
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:39,722
Okay. Here, careful.

568
00:56:41,631 --> 00:56:43,895
- God.
- Okay, it's fixed.

569
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:45,898
- You're such a baby.
- I'm not a baby.

570
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:47,297
Slow down. Slow down.

571
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:48,903
- I'm not a baby.
- You're a baby.

572
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:50,334
Nobody is a baby here.

573
00:56:50,507 --> 00:56:52,498
- I am not a baby!
- You're a little baby!

574
00:56:52,676 --> 00:56:54,337
I'm not a baby!

575
00:56:54,844 --> 00:56:58,336
Jeez, it won't stop! Please.

576
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:00,648
Okay, let's play the game.

577
00:57:00,817 --> 00:57:02,444
Fine.

578
00:57:09,292 --> 00:57:10,987
Won't stop spinning.

579
00:57:13,163 --> 00:57:15,188
- What's wrong with it?
- You broke it.

580
00:57:15,865 --> 00:57:18,766
Oh, look, there's the card.
See? It fixed itself.

581
00:57:20,904 --> 00:57:23,839
"Caught cheating.
Automatic ejection"?

582
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:27,470
- Does it mean me?
- Well, you did move the piece.

583
00:57:27,644 --> 00:57:28,838
He's the one who cheated.

584
00:57:33,516 --> 00:57:36,178
Walter!

585
00:57:42,492 --> 00:57:44,551
Hang on, Walter!

586
00:57:45,261 --> 00:57:46,990
I'll save you.

587
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:48,953
Help!

588
00:57:50,333 --> 00:57:52,858
Wait a minute! I got an idea!

589
00:58:00,176 --> 00:58:02,337
I'm gonna swing
this lamp up to you...

590
00:58:02,512 --> 00:58:04,844
...and you grab it,
and I'll pull you down.

591
00:58:05,015 --> 00:58:06,346
I can't hang on any longer!

592
00:58:12,055 --> 00:58:14,853
Don't worry, I'll get another lamp.

593
00:58:16,893 --> 00:58:18,485
Stand back.

594
00:58:37,814 --> 00:58:39,805
Walter?

595
00:58:47,223 --> 00:58:49,020
Walter.

596
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:59,268
Oh, no.

597
00:59:15,351 --> 00:59:17,080
You okay?

598
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:20,753
Are you okay?

599
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:25,189
Get away from me.

600
00:59:28,431 --> 00:59:29,989
Sorry.

601
00:59:30,166 --> 00:59:32,532
Don't talk to me till we get home.

602
00:59:35,438 --> 00:59:37,099
That look cool from down here?

603
00:59:37,273 --> 00:59:39,400
Because up there it was...
It was pretty intense.

604
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:43,137
My heart's pumping pretty good.
That was fun.

605
00:59:43,313 --> 00:59:46,612
Can you just play so I can get the heck
out of here and get away from you?

606
00:59:46,783 --> 00:59:49,650
- I told him I was sorry.
- Whatever.

607
00:59:49,819 --> 00:59:51,548
Okay, you know what
we need to do?

608
00:59:51,721 --> 00:59:53,348
We need to get
our heads right, okay?

609
00:59:53,523 --> 00:59:56,014
Pull it together. As a team.

610
00:59:56,192 --> 00:59:57,420
The three of us.

611
00:59:58,128 --> 01:00:00,460
You're up, big man. Bring us home.

612
01:00:00,897 --> 01:00:03,525
I got you, buddy. I promise.

613
01:00:25,021 --> 01:00:27,854
- What's it say?
- He can't read.

614
01:00:31,661 --> 01:00:33,959
"Lose map of galaxy.
Go back two spaces."

615
01:00:48,011 --> 01:00:49,569
I'm freezing my ass off.

616
01:00:50,046 --> 01:00:53,482
Forty degrees? Those savages.

617
01:01:09,532 --> 01:01:11,727
Yes. Nine.

618
01:01:12,369 --> 01:01:15,065
- Good roll.
- Good roll?

619
01:01:15,238 --> 01:01:18,002
- Nine's a great roll.
- I meant great.

620
01:01:20,977 --> 01:01:22,535
It's gold.

621
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:33,286
That's gotta be the best card
in the whole game.

622
01:01:33,456 --> 01:01:36,448
I'm almost to the end, look.
A few more and I win.

623
01:01:36,626 --> 01:01:39,254
I hope you win.
I don't care who wins.

624
01:01:39,429 --> 01:01:41,624
- Because you never win at anything.
- Hey.

625
01:01:41,798 --> 01:01:43,629
That's why he cheats,
he can never win.

626
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:44,994
- No, I don't.
- Yeah, you do.

627
01:01:45,168 --> 01:01:46,726
And you almost got me killed.

628
01:01:46,903 --> 01:01:49,565
- It wasn't my fault.
- It's not your fault?

629
01:01:49,739 --> 01:01:52,367
How is it not your fault?
This is all your fault.

630
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:54,009
Everything's your fault.

631
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:55,837
It's your fault Mom and Dad
got divorced.

632
01:01:56,012 --> 01:01:58,310
- Hey.
- You suck.

633
01:02:00,083 --> 01:02:01,573
Danny.

634
01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:11,759
I get my wish now, don't I?

635
01:02:12,829 --> 01:02:14,296
Yeah.

636
01:02:29,946 --> 01:02:31,504
Don't do it.

637
01:02:32,916 --> 01:02:34,907
Don't do what?

638
01:02:35,084 --> 01:02:36,813
Don't wish what you're thinking.

639
01:02:36,986 --> 01:02:38,817
You don't know what I'm thinking.

640
01:02:38,988 --> 01:02:40,819
Yeah, well, I can tell it ain't good.

641
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:48,655
Listen. No matter how good an idea
seems like when you're angry...

642
01:02:48,832 --> 01:02:51,357
...it never is. You gotta trust me
on this one, Walter.

643
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:09,050
What'd you wish for?

644
01:03:09,219 --> 01:03:11,653
- I can't tell you.
- Tell me.

645
01:03:11,821 --> 01:03:14,415
You know the rules about wishing.
If I told you, it won't...

646
01:03:14,591 --> 01:03:15,853
Tell me what you wished for.

647
01:03:16,025 --> 01:03:17,925
Get off me.

648
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:22,291
Danny.

649
01:03:23,233 --> 01:03:24,825
Danny.

650
01:03:36,613 --> 01:03:38,638
The card worked.

651
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:42,216
Yeah. It worked, congratulations.

652
01:03:42,385 --> 01:03:45,252
We're stuck in space now forever.

653
01:03:46,122 --> 01:03:47,384
Leave him alone.

654
01:03:53,796 --> 01:03:55,093
What did you wish for?

655
01:03:56,599 --> 01:04:00,000
- This.
- You wished for a football?

656
01:04:00,436 --> 01:04:02,734
Signed by Brett Favre.

657
01:04:02,906 --> 01:04:04,635
Why'd you wish for a football?

658
01:04:04,807 --> 01:04:06,672
You could have
just wished the game over.

659
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:08,538
You could have wished us
out of here.

660
01:04:08,711 --> 01:04:12,340
I was under a lot of pressure.
He was yelling at me.

661
01:04:14,784 --> 01:04:16,376
Why were you yelling at him?

662
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:23,488
Okay, guys.

663
01:04:23,660 --> 01:04:25,525
Here's the thing.

664
01:04:27,063 --> 01:04:29,725
I've played this game before.

665
01:04:29,899 --> 01:04:34,233
Okay? I played it
with my own brother 15 years ago.

666
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:38,299
- You're a player?
- Yeah. Just like you guys.

667
01:04:38,808 --> 01:04:41,174
We were fighting a lot back then.

668
01:04:41,344 --> 01:04:44,245
And when the game started,
it got even worse.

669
01:04:44,781 --> 01:04:48,547
Every time we spun, we got madder
and madder at one another.

670
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:51,209
And then I landed on the star space.

671
01:04:51,387 --> 01:04:53,252
The same one
that Walter just landed on.

672
01:04:54,090 --> 01:04:59,153
Well, I was so mad at him,
that when the star passed...

673
01:05:00,163 --> 01:05:02,097
...I made my wish.

674
01:05:03,099 --> 01:05:04,498
What'd you wish for?

675
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:07,593
I wished that my brother
had never been born.

676
01:05:08,404 --> 01:05:09,962
Oh, my God.

677
01:05:10,139 --> 01:05:12,039
Soon as I did it, I felt horrible.

678
01:05:12,208 --> 01:05:14,403
I thought, you know,
if I could spin again...

679
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:18,513
...maybe I... I could land on another
star space and... And wish him back.

680
01:05:18,681 --> 01:05:20,842
But the game wouldn't let me...

681
01:05:21,818 --> 01:05:23,581
...because it wasn't my turn.

682
01:05:25,021 --> 01:05:26,283
Walter.

683
01:05:26,689 --> 01:05:28,657
There are some games...

684
01:05:28,825 --> 01:05:31,020
...you can't play alone.

685
01:05:32,562 --> 01:05:33,961
So, what do we do now?

686
01:05:34,364 --> 01:05:38,266
We go back downstairs and
we finish this thing once and for all.

687
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:40,868
No more cheating.
No more arguing.

688
01:05:41,037 --> 01:05:44,029
All you guys have to do
is spin a few more times.

689
01:05:44,207 --> 01:05:46,437
I'll help you fight off
whatever comes out.

690
01:05:46,609 --> 01:05:48,270
Deal?

691
01:05:48,444 --> 01:05:50,878
- Deal.
- Deal.

692
01:05:52,582 --> 01:05:53,844
Is it getting hot in here?

693
01:05:56,352 --> 01:05:58,946
You blew out the pilot light
on the furnace, right?

694
01:06:04,727 --> 01:06:06,661
Stay put.

695
01:06:26,783 --> 01:06:28,410
Zorgons.

696
01:06:29,719 --> 01:06:32,813
My gerbil was in there.

697
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:35,150
This is bad.

698
01:06:35,325 --> 01:06:36,883
This is very bad.

699
01:06:37,593 --> 01:06:39,823
Why? We didn't get eaten.

700
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:41,691
Where did you leave the game?

701
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:46,860
In the living room.

702
01:06:47,036 --> 01:06:48,628
Great.

703
01:06:48,805 --> 01:06:52,400
The game's our only way home,
and now the Zorgons are burning it.

704
01:06:53,109 --> 01:06:55,543
There is one thing we can do.

705
01:07:01,117 --> 01:07:02,948
Waiting for an invitation?
Come on.

706
01:07:13,596 --> 01:07:16,064
- Put your back into it.
- Come on.

707
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:20,965
Why are we doing this?

708
01:07:41,758 --> 01:07:43,658
Walter?

709
01:07:54,804 --> 01:07:57,295
You guys actually
set the house on fire!

710
01:07:57,473 --> 01:07:59,668
- Lisa's back.
- Lisa's unfrozen.

711
01:07:59,842 --> 01:08:02,174
You're okay. You're okay, Lisa.

712
01:08:02,345 --> 01:08:05,678
Get off me! Get off me!
Try and find the fire extinguisher!

713
01:08:05,848 --> 01:08:08,646
- No, Lisa, wait. No, Lisa, wait.
- No, Lisa, no.

714
01:08:08,818 --> 01:08:11,787
- Stop! Lisa, don't.
- The Zorgons are attracted to fire.

715
01:08:11,954 --> 01:08:13,319
Lisa, stop.

716
01:08:13,489 --> 01:08:14,478
No, Lisa, don't do it!

717
01:08:14,657 --> 01:08:16,784
No, Lisa, don't do that.
We gotta keep the fire.

718
01:08:16,959 --> 01:08:20,759
- The Zorgons are attracted to fire!
- Lisa, wait. No, Lisa, don't do it.

719
01:08:20,963 --> 01:08:22,453
No, Lisa.

720
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:27,968
- Great.
- Now we'll never get the game back.

721
01:08:28,137 --> 01:08:32,005
Okay. Don't worry. They're back.

722
01:08:32,375 --> 01:08:35,435
- Who the hell are you?
- The astronaut.

723
01:08:35,645 --> 01:08:37,670
From the game we're in.

724
01:08:37,847 --> 01:08:39,405
Danny spun me.

725
01:08:48,324 --> 01:08:51,623
What is that? What is that?

726
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:53,823
What's going on? Where are we?

727
01:08:54,697 --> 01:08:57,325
Somebody please
talk to me right now!

728
01:08:58,534 --> 01:09:02,470
All right, they're arming the harpoons.
They're gonna board us.

729
01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:04,538
- What's gonna board us?
- Guys, look alive.

730
01:09:04,707 --> 01:09:06,641
- What's gonna board us?
- The Zorgons.

731
01:09:06,809 --> 01:09:09,937
- What's a Zorgon?
- They're lizard-men. They eat meat.

732
01:09:10,112 --> 01:09:11,545
We're meat!

733
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:20,421
- Come on, let's hide downstairs!
- Okay, listen, when they dock...

734
01:09:20,590 --> 01:09:23,115
...I'll sneak on the ship and
steal the game. You got it?

735
01:09:23,292 --> 01:09:24,452
- Hang on.
- What?

736
01:09:24,627 --> 01:09:27,460
- Did she say downstairs?
- Oh, no.

737
01:09:39,976 --> 01:09:40,965
Hey, hey.

738
01:09:41,377 --> 01:09:43,902
Just stay with us,
and everything will be okay.

739
01:09:48,084 --> 01:09:49,415
I'll never leave you.

740
01:09:55,992 --> 01:09:57,892
Move, move, move.

741
01:10:01,631 --> 01:10:03,292
Go, go.

742
01:10:41,404 --> 01:10:44,703
Okay. It's gotten
pretty serious out there.

743
01:10:44,874 --> 01:10:46,774
I need you guys to hide in here.

744
01:10:46,943 --> 01:10:48,774
I'll keep in touch with these.

745
01:10:48,945 --> 01:10:50,503
They won't work.
Danny broke them.

746
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:53,740
He pulled off the antenna.
They're completely destroyed.

747
01:10:55,618 --> 01:10:57,279
Testing.

748
01:10:58,020 --> 01:10:59,715
It works.

749
01:11:00,089 --> 01:11:02,819
Listen, keep the volume low.

750
01:11:02,992 --> 01:11:04,516
Only use that if you need me.

751
01:11:04,694 --> 01:11:07,322
Wa... Wait, where are you going?

752
01:11:07,496 --> 01:11:09,623
I'm gonna go find the game.

753
01:11:20,209 --> 01:11:22,541
He has gorgeous eyes.

754
01:11:25,414 --> 01:11:26,881
What?

755
01:11:27,683 --> 01:11:30,652
He obviously feels
very protective over me.

756
01:11:31,654 --> 01:11:33,315
I just...

757
01:11:33,623 --> 01:11:35,386
I just feel so safe around him.

758
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:37,649
<i>Zorgons</i>.

759
01:11:37,827 --> 01:11:39,294
<i>Oh, my God</i>.

760
01:11:39,462 --> 01:11:43,125
<i>The place is crawling with them</i>.
<i>They're all over the basement</i>.

761
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:46,996
<i>Wait, I think in the corner</i>
<i>I see the game</i>.

762
01:11:47,169 --> 01:11:48,796
<i>Yeah, the box is right there</i>.

763
01:11:49,205 --> 01:11:52,538
<i>Hang on, I'm...</i> <i>I'm gonna get closer</i>.

764
01:11:55,077 --> 01:11:56,237
Did he get the game?

765
01:12:03,819 --> 01:12:06,344
- Hello?
- What's going on?

766
01:12:06,522 --> 01:12:08,046
Are you there? Hello?

767
01:12:08,224 --> 01:12:10,317
- What's happening?
- Hello?

768
01:12:10,493 --> 01:12:11,721
Is he dead?

769
01:12:46,362 --> 01:12:48,626
The game was right there.

770
01:12:49,598 --> 01:12:52,624
It was right across from the furnace.
I couldn't get it.

771
01:12:53,069 --> 01:12:56,402
There's too many of them down there.
They're all over the basement.

772
01:12:56,806 --> 01:12:58,637
Are there any upstairs?

773
01:12:58,808 --> 01:13:01,333
Not yet. But as soon as
they're done down there...

774
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:03,410
It's okay. You tried your hardest.

775
01:13:04,046 --> 01:13:06,105
- We believe in you.
- Will you please?

776
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:09,415
Okay.

777
01:13:09,752 --> 01:13:12,619
- The dumbwaiter.
- What?

778
01:13:12,922 --> 01:13:15,482
The dumbwaiter is across
from the furnace.

779
01:13:15,658 --> 01:13:17,319
It's a little elevator.

780
01:13:17,860 --> 01:13:19,725
You could sneak right in it...

781
01:13:20,029 --> 01:13:21,792
...we'll lower you down...

782
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:23,755
...you could grab the game...

783
01:13:23,933 --> 01:13:25,958
...and we'll pull you right back up.

784
01:13:26,602 --> 01:13:28,126
So easy.

785
01:13:28,304 --> 01:13:29,965
Right, Walter?

786
01:13:30,139 --> 01:13:32,437
Yeah, but he's too big.

787
01:13:33,008 --> 01:13:34,839
Yeah.

788
01:13:35,010 --> 01:13:36,841
It was a good plan, though.

789
01:13:37,213 --> 01:13:38,578
It was a great plan.

790
01:13:38,748 --> 01:13:39,976
Yeah, it was.

791
01:13:40,216 --> 01:13:41,581
It was.

792
01:13:41,751 --> 01:13:43,912
Too bad he wouldn't fit.

793
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:46,350
I wouldn't even fit.

794
01:13:50,726 --> 01:13:54,025
I sure wish we knew someone
that was small enough.

795
01:13:54,964 --> 01:13:58,195
Do we really need the game?

796
01:14:08,444 --> 01:14:10,639
How you doing in there?

797
01:14:12,515 --> 01:14:13,948
Okay.

798
01:14:14,116 --> 01:14:17,347
Listen to me.
It's gonna be real easy, okay?

799
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:21,047
Just gonna lower you down there,
grab the game, and we'll pull you up.

800
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:22,818
Yeah.

801
01:14:22,992 --> 01:14:25,256
Nothing's gonna happen
to you, okay?

802
01:14:25,427 --> 01:14:27,793
- Yeah.
- Because I'm your brother.

803
01:14:28,030 --> 01:14:30,430
And that's what
being a brother means.

804
01:14:30,833 --> 01:14:32,858
Means I'll never let
anything happen to you.

805
01:14:33,035 --> 01:14:36,163
- Okay?
- Yeah.

806
01:14:36,705 --> 01:14:39,833
Okay. This is just gonna
take a few seconds, okay?

807
01:14:40,009 --> 01:14:42,807
- Hey, Walter?
- Yeah?

808
01:14:43,445 --> 01:14:45,379
I'm sorry I cheated.

809
01:14:46,348 --> 01:14:47,542
I know.

810
01:14:53,155 --> 01:14:56,181
- You ready to do this?
- I'm ready.

811
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:55,581
He's right there.

812
01:15:55,751 --> 01:15:59,050
<i>Guys, why did you stop?</i>

813
01:16:12,001 --> 01:16:14,834
Guys, come on.

814
01:16:15,004 --> 01:16:17,063
I'm not at the bottom yet.

815
01:16:27,449 --> 01:16:29,144
Help me. Come on.

816
01:16:31,153 --> 01:16:33,417
That's it. Pull, pull.
Come on, come on.

817
01:16:33,589 --> 01:16:35,454
Go. Go.

818
01:16:41,964 --> 01:16:45,024
They're back.
They're coming up the stairs.

819
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:47,225
Get out of here. Go on.

820
01:16:47,403 --> 01:16:48,768
Go, go, go.

821
01:17:35,617 --> 01:17:37,016
Oh, no.

822
01:18:20,062 --> 01:18:21,495
Guys.

823
01:18:21,663 --> 01:18:24,496
It was just the box.

824
01:18:36,044 --> 01:18:39,571
Wait. I see the game.

825
01:18:40,082 --> 01:18:42,482
It's on the Zorgon ship.

826
01:18:46,989 --> 01:18:49,924
But I think I can get it.

827
01:18:51,260 --> 01:18:53,956
<i>Danny, do not get on that ship</i>.

828
01:18:54,129 --> 01:18:56,461
<i>Just stay put</i>.
<i>We'll come and get you</i>.

829
01:19:54,556 --> 01:19:56,114
<i>Danny</i>.

830
01:19:57,259 --> 01:19:58,726
<i>Danny. Danny, listen to me</i>.

831
01:19:58,894 --> 01:20:01,624
<i>The Zorgons are up here</i>.
<i>Just stay put</i>.

832
01:20:01,797 --> 01:20:03,788
<i>The pulley broke...</i>
<i>- figure out...</i>

833
01:20:03,966 --> 01:20:07,163
<i>We got rope...</i> <i>So just stay put</i>.

834
01:20:08,170 --> 01:20:10,468
<i>Danny. Danny, are you there?</i>

835
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:12,436
<i>Danny, the Zorgons are up here</i>.

836
01:20:12,607 --> 01:20:14,336
<i>If you can hear me, listen</i>.

837
01:20:14,509 --> 01:20:18,138
<i>We're not pulling you up right now</i>.
<i>Stay put</i>.

838
01:20:18,313 --> 01:20:20,008
<i>We just saw one. Hold tight</i>.

839
01:20:55,283 --> 01:20:58,411
It's just a goat. It's just a goat.

840
01:20:58,854 --> 01:21:00,754
It's just a...

841
01:21:01,456 --> 01:21:04,584
It's not a goat. It's not a goat.
It's not a goat.

842
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:07,320
It's not a goat. It's not a goat.

843
01:21:07,496 --> 01:21:08,929
It's not a goat.

844
01:21:10,999 --> 01:21:12,398
It's not a goat.

845
01:22:50,999 --> 01:22:53,229
Guys, pull me up.

846
01:22:56,305 --> 01:22:59,706
They got goats with four eyes.

847
01:23:48,557 --> 01:23:50,024
Guys! Quick!

848
01:23:50,192 --> 01:23:52,183
I have the game!

849
01:23:53,729 --> 01:23:55,253
Come on.

850
01:23:56,531 --> 01:23:57,964
Walter.

851
01:23:58,133 --> 01:24:01,694
I told you I wouldn't let anything
happen to you. Come on.

852
01:24:22,758 --> 01:24:25,192
<i>Emergency</i>.

853
01:24:28,430 --> 01:24:30,295
<i>Alien life form</i>.

854
01:24:30,465 --> 01:24:32,433
<i>Must destroy</i>.

855
01:24:32,601 --> 01:24:34,796
He still wants to kill me.

856
01:24:41,276 --> 01:24:44,245
Use the card. Quick.

857
01:24:44,413 --> 01:24:46,176
Reprogram.

858
01:25:04,699 --> 01:25:06,530
<i>Alien life form</i>.

859
01:25:09,204 --> 01:25:10,967
<i>Must destroy</i>.

860
01:25:39,367 --> 01:25:40,959
<i>Alien life form</i>.

861
01:25:41,136 --> 01:25:43,331
<i>Must destroy</i>.

862
01:25:47,676 --> 01:25:51,112
Guess that's what
the reprogram card's for.

863
01:25:51,279 --> 01:25:53,179
I like that card.

864
01:25:53,348 --> 01:25:55,373
It's a good card.

865
01:25:56,785 --> 01:25:58,650
Where's Lisa?

866
01:26:04,359 --> 01:26:05,690
Lisa...

867
01:26:05,861 --> 01:26:07,351
...is upstairs.

868
01:26:07,529 --> 01:26:09,394
What fell?

869
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:16,029
Little excessive, but I like it.
Come on.

870
01:26:16,771 --> 01:26:18,762
Come on, come on, come on.

871
01:26:26,114 --> 01:26:27,376
Okay, spin it, buddy.

872
01:26:36,958 --> 01:26:38,755
Almost there.

873
01:26:42,864 --> 01:26:44,331
I got it.

874
01:26:52,207 --> 01:26:54,266
I'm not even gonna
comment on that.

875
01:26:57,111 --> 01:26:58,476
My turn.

876
01:27:30,245 --> 01:27:32,008
I get another wish.

877
01:27:51,933 --> 01:27:53,764
Thanks for helping us out.

878
01:28:04,912 --> 01:28:08,643
I wish the astronaut
had his brother back.

879
01:28:36,144 --> 01:28:38,408
You wished for two of me?

880
01:28:38,579 --> 01:28:39,807
No. I...

881
01:28:39,981 --> 01:28:42,381
I wished the astronaut guy
had his brother back.

882
01:28:49,691 --> 01:28:52,251
- Danny.
- Who are you?

883
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:54,387
It's me.

884
01:28:54,929 --> 01:28:57,830
It's Walter. I'm your brother.

885
01:28:57,999 --> 01:29:00,058
- What?
- Wha..?

886
01:29:00,234 --> 01:29:02,327
No, you're not.

887
01:29:02,503 --> 01:29:03,868
He is.

888
01:29:04,806 --> 01:29:06,239
Yes.

889
01:29:06,441 --> 01:29:09,205
I'm older, but I'm him.

890
01:29:09,377 --> 01:29:12,175
- I came back for you.
- What's going on here?

891
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:01,121
That was awesome.

892
01:30:09,670 --> 01:30:11,194
Thank you.

893
01:30:11,973 --> 01:30:13,372
I...

894
01:30:13,541 --> 01:30:15,509
- I didn't...
- You did a good job.

895
01:30:16,110 --> 01:30:18,101
You did better than I did.

896
01:30:19,247 --> 01:30:20,578
Thanks.

897
01:30:21,082 --> 01:30:23,414
Now, make sure
he gets home safe, okay?

898
01:30:24,285 --> 01:30:25,752
Okay.

899
01:30:54,816 --> 01:30:57,182
- He was me.
- Yeah.

900
01:30:57,351 --> 01:30:59,251
Oh, my God. And I wanted to...

901
01:31:18,572 --> 01:31:19,869
Ten. You need 10 to win.

902
01:31:20,174 --> 01:31:22,301
Need a 10. Need a 10.

903
01:31:34,221 --> 01:31:36,815
One. God, I suck.

904
01:31:51,572 --> 01:31:53,506
- Danny, you won.
- I won?

905
01:31:53,674 --> 01:31:56,108
- He won?
- You won, Danny. You beat the game.

906
01:31:56,277 --> 01:31:58,074
You won the game.
We can go home.

907
01:31:58,245 --> 01:31:59,906
I reached Zathura!

908
01:32:41,388 --> 01:32:44,721
"Game over.
Thank you for playing"?

909
01:32:45,358 --> 01:32:48,156
- That's it?
- Now what?

910
01:33:06,446 --> 01:33:07,845
I think we're home.

911
01:33:12,285 --> 01:33:14,014
Walter!

912
01:33:18,558 --> 01:33:20,458
Lisa!

913
01:33:29,603 --> 01:33:32,003
It's a black hole!

914
01:33:32,172 --> 01:33:35,141
Zathura is a black hole!

915
01:34:11,845 --> 01:34:13,540
Danny!

916
01:34:16,316 --> 01:34:21,948
No!

917
01:34:24,157 --> 01:34:26,250
<i>Two-run shot. Are you kidding me?</i>

918
01:34:26,426 --> 01:34:29,623
<i>A 's up 5-4. Keith Foulke</i>
<i>leads the bigs in home runs...</i>

919
01:34:29,796 --> 01:34:31,821
...<i>given up by a reliever with six</i>.

920
01:34:31,998 --> 01:34:33,966
<i>Bottom nine. Red Sox down, 5-4</i>.

921
01:34:34,134 --> 01:34:38,002
<i>Octavio Dotel in for the save</i>.
<i>He ain't really saving a whole lot</i>.

922
01:34:38,171 --> 01:34:39,900
<i>He walks "Big Papi" Ortiz...</i>

923
01:34:40,073 --> 01:34:42,974
...<i>to tie up the inning</i>.
<i>Kevin Millar up next</i>.

924
01:34:43,877 --> 01:34:46,107
<i>After an Ortiz walk, ninth inning...</i>

925
01:34:47,681 --> 01:34:49,239
Walter?

926
01:34:50,150 --> 01:34:52,983
- Don't push that button.
<i>- Let's get back to the here and now</i>.

927
01:34:53,153 --> 01:34:55,144
<i>There's no way it's gonna</i>
<i>happen again, is it?</i>

928
01:34:55,322 --> 01:34:56,983
<i>No way</i>.
<i>No, it doesn't happen again</i>.

929
01:34:57,157 --> 01:34:59,250
<i>Millar pops out to left field</i>.

930
01:35:11,972 --> 01:35:14,099
Richard's back!

931
01:35:14,274 --> 01:35:16,037
- I did it.
- You won the game.

932
01:35:16,209 --> 01:35:18,575
- I won the game. I beat Zathura.
- We're home.

933
01:35:18,745 --> 01:35:20,542
- We're home!
- We did it. We're home.

934
01:35:20,714 --> 01:35:23,512
I distinctly remember asking you guys
not to kill each other.

935
01:35:23,683 --> 01:35:26,083
Dad, it was so awesome.
There was this game...

936
01:35:26,253 --> 01:35:28,949
...and it sent us to outer space.
- And there was a black hole.

937
01:35:29,122 --> 01:35:30,612
We almost had to stay forever.

938
01:35:30,790 --> 01:35:34,021
- I stole the game from the Zorgons.
- And I saw myself older.

939
01:35:35,095 --> 01:35:36,687
Sounds like a lot of fun.

940
01:35:37,097 --> 01:35:39,565
It's almost 3:00,
and Mom's gonna be here any minute.

941
01:35:39,733 --> 01:35:42,566
Grab all games and books,
whatever you wanna take to her house.

942
01:35:42,736 --> 01:35:44,567
Come on, get ready to go.

943
01:35:46,907 --> 01:35:50,104
Good throw. Right to the chest.
Catch this one.

944
01:35:51,544 --> 01:35:53,341
- Caught it.
- Nice.

945
01:35:56,383 --> 01:35:58,544
All right, ready? Here we go.

946
01:35:58,718 --> 01:36:02,085
Brett Favre takes the snap.
He's looking. It's a great pass.

947
01:36:02,889 --> 01:36:04,516
- Touchdown.
- Touchdown.

948
01:36:05,992 --> 01:36:08,085
- Just a second, Mom.
- Hey, Mom.

949
01:36:10,330 --> 01:36:12,992
What happened to the football
signed by Brett Favre?

950
01:36:13,166 --> 01:36:16,226
- It's gone.
- What happened to it?

951
01:36:16,403 --> 01:36:18,030
It never happened.

952
01:36:18,204 --> 01:36:19,762
Oh, right.

953
01:36:21,975 --> 01:36:24,273
We never speak of this. Okay?

954
01:36:25,211 --> 01:36:27,645
- Never happened.
- Never happened.

955
01:36:30,550 --> 01:36:32,780
