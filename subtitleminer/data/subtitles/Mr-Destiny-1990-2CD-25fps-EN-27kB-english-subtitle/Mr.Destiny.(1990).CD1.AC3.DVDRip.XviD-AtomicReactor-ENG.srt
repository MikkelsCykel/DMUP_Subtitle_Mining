1
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:54,390
Don't-Don't.
Damn.

2
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,350
<i>Destiny's a pretty big concept
when you think about it.</i>

3
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:03,990
<i>Where you are in life,
how you got there...</i>

4
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:06,630
<i>what would have happened if one
thing or another had been different.</i>

5
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:11,030
<i>To be honest...</i>

6
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,510
<i>I never gave it
much thought, myself...</i>

7
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,470
<i>until today,
June 14th...</i>

8
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:18,790
<i>my 35th birthday...</i>

9
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:22,710
<i>and without a doubt,
the strangest day of my life.</i>

10
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:31,630
<i>Do you remember
the old story that starts...</i>

11
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:34,190
<i>this guy
goes into a bar?</i>

12
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:38,590
<i>Well, I'm the guy,
and here's the story.</i>

13
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,790
<i>But wait a minute.
I'm getting way ahead of myself.</i>

14
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:46,190
<i>To tell
this story right...</i>

15
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:49,230
<i>I should start
where it really begins...</i>

16
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:52,270
<i>20 years ago today,
as a matter of fact.</i>

17
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:56,270
<i>June 14th, 1970,
my 15th birthday...</i>

18
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:59,790
<i>and also
a very strange day.</i>

19
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:04,710
<i>It was the all-state
high school championship game...</i>

20
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,630
<i>bottom of the 9th,
2 outs.</i>

21
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:11,030
<i>Our school hadn't made it
to the finals in 25 years...</i>

22
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:13,710
<i>so out of a town
of 30,000 people...</i>

23
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:16,630
<i>38,000 showed up
for the game.</i>

24
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,030
<i>Fillmore High
had us by a run...</i>

25
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:21,590
<i>and it was
a 3-2 count.</i>

26
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:23,750
<i>Fenwick was
standing on 3rd...</i>

27
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:26,670
<i>like the bag was getting ready
to explode under his feet.</i>

28
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,390
<i>The championship had
come down to one batter...</i>

29
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,790
<i>Yeah, you guessed it...</i>

30
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:34,710
<i>yours truly,
Larry Burrows.</i>

31
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:38,110
<i>Haskins was
throwing fastballs...</i>

32
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:41,430
<i>because that was
the only pitch he ever threw.</i>

33
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:43,630
<i>So I was ready
for the next one.</i>

34
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:46,030
Paste it, Lar!
You can do it.

35
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:47,630
Have an eye!

36
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,990
Swing, babe,
it's all yours!

37
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:53,390
<i>Then something
weird happened.</i>

38
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:56,150
<i>Don't ask me
what it was...</i>

39
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:59,110
<i>'cause it only happened
for a split second.</i>

40
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:03,670
<i>But that was enough
to change my life forever.</i>

41
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,270
Strike 3!

42
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:15,030
<i>Why is it when you do
something terrific...</i>

43
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:17,270
<i>9 times out of 10
you're alone...</i>

44
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:19,950
<i>but when you
screw up really big...</i>

45
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:22,310
<i>the whole world
is watching?</i>

46
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:27,350
<i>I wanted to crawl under
home plate and never come out.</i>

47
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,990
<i>As usual...</i>

48
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:32,270
<i>my best friend, Clip Metzler,
tried to cheer me up.</i>

49
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:34,750
<i>Clip's very big
on novelty gags.</i>

50
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:36,750
Aren't they cool?

51
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:39,350
I scared the crap
out of my baby sister.

52
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,390
Want to
try them on?

53
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,350
Thanks, Clipper...

54
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,630
but I'd kinda
like to be alone.

55
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:48,430
Sure, Lar.
Whatever you say.

56
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,910
I'll call you later.
We'll see a movie.

57
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:56,710
<i>We could see
Bonnie and Clyde again.</i>

58
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,350
<i>- What do you say?
- Sure, Clip.</i>

59
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:01,270
Great!

60
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,270
I'll see you
later then.

61
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:09,990
<i>It was the worst
moment of my life.</i>

62
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,390
<i>God, I felt bad.</i>

63
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:31,550
<i>Looks like you could
use one of these.</i>

64
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:34,790
Yeah, I must've gotten
some dust in my eyes.

65
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:37,590
There was a lot
of dust out there.

66
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:40,510
- Thanks.
- You can keep it.

67
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:43,710
<i>My aunt sends me
2 dozen every Christmas.</i>

68
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:46,390
<i>What's E.J.R. Stand for?</i>

69
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:50,390
Ellen Jane Ripley.
What's your name?

70
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:53,390
LarryJoseph Burrows.

71
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:56,230
Nice to meet
you, Larry.

72
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:59,150
<i>I thought that
was really sweet...</i>

73
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:03,030
<i>her not saying anything about
me crying like a big baby.</i>

74
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,390
<i>Really sweet.</i>

75
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,190
<i>- Larry?
- So I married her.</i>

76
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:10,230
I've been calling you
for the last 5 minutes.

77
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,550
<i>Not right then, of course,
but several years later.</i>

78
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,950
Honey, were you
thinking about...

79
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:18,350
that silly
baseball game again?

80
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:21,510
No, no,
not at all.

81
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:24,670
I was working on
my '55 Porsche Spider.

82
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,190
<i>I was, really.</i>

83
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,110
Ain't it a beaut?

84
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:31,630
James Dean used
to drive one of these...

85
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:33,830
only his was
much bigger.

86
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:36,150
<i>Ellen and I have
a pretty regular life.</i>

87
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:38,470
<i>We have a 2-bedroom
house in the suburbs...</i>

88
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:40,430
<i>that isn't
quite finished...</i>

89
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:43,870
<i>and a contractor named Guzelman
who doesn't want to quite finish it.</i>

90
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:48,470
Hey, Mr. Guzelman,
how are you?

91
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:51,590
I haven't seen you
in the past 6 weeks.

92
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:55,070
I thought you were
captured by some aliens.

93
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:57,950
I got your message.
Problem with something?

94
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:01,430
Uh, yeah,
it's the driveway.

95
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,830
What's wrong?

96
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:05,830
Well, do you think
maybe we can pave it?

97
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:09,910
Well, you can't pave
until the mud is all gone.

98
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:14,710
Then we just have to get
rid of the mud, right?

99
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:16,790
I don't do mud.

100
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:19,190
You need
a mud guy for that.

101
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:21,150
- "A mud guy"?
- Yes.

102
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:24,310
- They have that?
- A mud guy, yes.

103
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,310
- Anything else?
- Now that you mention it...

104
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:29,870
it would be nice
to have a front lawn.

105
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,790
I need a check
for that.

106
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:34,870
- How much?
- $1,000.

107
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:38,350
- Don't you know another number?
- $2,000.

108
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:42,630
<i>We have
a dog named Sammy.</i>

109
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:45,950
<i>I found him in an alley,
so I brought him home.</i>

110
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,390
Sammy peed
on the rug again.

111
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:50,710
Way to go, Sammy.

112
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:54,430
<i>He has a nervous bladder,
but a good heart.</i>

113
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:57,350
We're out of Wheaties.
Do we have another box?

114
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:00,910
No, I forgot
to buy any. Sorry.

115
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:03,990
I've had Wheaties for breakfast
every morning of my life...

116
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:06,150
since I was
6 years old.

117
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:09,470
Is it too much to ask that
we keep an extra box on hand...

118
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:12,030
<i>in the event of
a crisis like this?</i>

119
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:14,550
You gave Guzelman
another check.

120
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:18,190
I did not give Guzelman
another check!

121
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:21,830
You're pissed off,
so you're taking it out on me.

122
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:25,870
Okay, okay, so I gave
Guzelman another check.

123
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:29,670
<i>Don't you hate it when
somebody knows you that well?</i>

124
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,790
<i>You can't get
away with anything.</i>

125
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:36,510
<i>But I guess that's
just part of marriage.</i>

126
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,990
<i>So's the occasional argument.</i>

127
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:42,710
<i>They're tearing down
"The Golf of Mexico. "</i>

128
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:46,790
- That's where we went on our 1 st date.
- That was our 2nd date.

129
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,950
It was our 1 st date.

130
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:52,350
You tripped over the grinning
bandito and split your pants.

131
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,710
Our 1 st date
was at Mr. Pizza.

132
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:57,870
You ate anchovies
and belched all night.

133
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:02,550
That was our 3rd date,
and I just burped a few times.

134
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:05,750
<i>But we never argue
about anything important...</i>

135
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:08,470
<i>and we always make up.</i>

136
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:11,470
Okay, okay, okay.

137
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:14,030
All right,
see you after work.

138
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:15,510
I forgot.

139
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:18,750
<i>I'm gonna be late tonight.
There's a union meeting.</i>

140
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,950
Another one?
What for?

141
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:23,710
They want me to be chairman
of the strike committee.

142
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:26,630
Somebody has to stop
these management creeps...

143
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:29,230
from laying everybody off.

144
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,230
But it's
my birthday.

145
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:34,070
What'd you say?

146
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:36,430
Never mind.
Forget it.

147
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,630
She forgot.

148
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:44,110
I need some coffee.

149
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:48,110
<i>Nothing had happened
to make me think...</i>

150
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:50,150
<i>that this was
going to be...</i>

151
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:53,070
<i>anything more than just another
routine day at the office.</i>

152
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:55,470
<i>As usual,
by the time I arrived...</i>

153
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:58,310
<i>there was
no coffee left...</i>

154
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:02,150
<i>and no water.</i>

155
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:04,190
Great.

156
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:12,670
<i>So I did the only thing
I could think of.</i>

157
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:18,630
I've gotta
have my coffee.

158
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:22,790
<i>Why is it when you have a mouthful of
freeze-dried, your boss walks in on you?</i>

159
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,750
How they hanging?

160
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,790
<i>- I'm not interrupting anything, am I?
- No, Mr. Bumpers.</i>

161
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,790
I'm having
my coffee.

162
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,910
<i>Lay off the
"Mr. Bumpers"crap.</i>

163
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:34,070
How many times
do I gotta tell you?

164
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:36,190
We're both on
the same team.

165
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:39,830
<i>Jackie's a sweet guy, but kinda
dumb for a company president.</i>

166
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:42,590
In football, they
called me "Cement Head,"

167
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:44,790
<i>but you can
call me. Jackie.</i>

168
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,830
Yes, sir,
Jackie.

169
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:49,110
I was going over
the quarterly reports.

170
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:51,230
Damn fine work.
A real touchdown.

171
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:54,550
<i>- Just doing my job.
- Don't think I don't appreciate it.</i>

172
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:58,510
A quarterback's only as good
as his linemen, right?

173
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:00,230
Yep.

174
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:03,950
<i>I'm just a big, dumb jock who got
lucky and married the boss'daughter.</i>

175
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:12,950
It's guys like you that
make me look like a hotshot.

176
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:15,310
I appreciate it.
Thank you.

177
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:17,390
Well, Lar...

178
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:20,150
just keep up
the good work, huh?

179
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:23,430
I just came by to see
how you were doing.

180
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:28,550
Now, that's funny.

181
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,110
<i>Toilet paper in the nose.</i>

182
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,870
Why didn't
I think of that?

183
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:38,470
I'm trying
to get a promotion!

184
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:41,750
Will you relax?
Your suck points are safe.

185
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:45,110
Believe me, Cement Head
didn't notice a thing.

186
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:47,990
Oh, Clip,
you kill me.

187
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:51,030
Happy 35th,
buddy.

188
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:52,950
Thanks, Clip.

189
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:56,150
I honestly didn't think
anybody remembered.

190
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:58,950
<i>This is great.
Wow.!</i>

191
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:01,750
<i>- Artificial puke.
- That's the stuff we used to throw...</i>

192
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,670
into the girls'
locker room...

193
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,590
so they'd get scared and
run out in their underwear.

194
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:09,750
This is the actual stuff?
Mr. Green confiscated this.

195
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,430
He did...

196
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:14,350
next day, I broke in
and confiscated it back.

197
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:17,590
<i>- We had fun in those days.
- We sure did.</i>

198
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:21,390
Well, where's my
"thank you" kiss?

199
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,310
<i>No, Clip.</i>

200
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,470
- No kiss.
- Just one.

201
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:28,390
We're in the office.
Stop it!

202
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:32,430
<i>Why is it when your best friend's
kissing you on the head...</i>

203
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:35,790
<i>a beautiful woman
comes along and catches you?</i>

204
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:39,950
Hi, CindyJo.
How are you?

205
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:43,750
What a coincidence.
Jackie was just here.

206
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:45,670
<i>You know,
your husband.</i>

207
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,990
How've you been?
We've been fine.

208
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,910
Clip and I
are pretty good.

209
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:52,030
Work, work,
that's all we do.

210
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:53,950
How've you been?

211
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:56,150
I've been fine.

212
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:59,150
Thank you for
asking... 3 times.

213
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:01,110
Uh, well...

214
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:03,910
I just wanted to make
absolutely sure.

215
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,990
<i>Cindy. Jo's father
owns the company.</i>

216
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:07,950
<i>She's married
to. Jackie.</i>

217
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:10,990
<i>That's how a guy named "Cement
Head" gets to be president.</i>

218
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:13,150
Did Jackie
go to his office?

219
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:15,830
Yeah.

220
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:18,870
Yeah, I'm sure he did.
He had lots of work to do.

221
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:21,470
Touchdowns
and all that stuff.

222
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,550
It was nice
seeing you again.

223
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:26,190
<i>Bye, Clip.</i>

224
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:32,070
<i>Nice seeing you, too, Cindy.</i>

225
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:34,710
<i>Maybe it was because
it was my birthday,;</i>

226
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:38,030
<i>maybe it was seeing Cindy. Jo,
I don't know,;</i>

227
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:42,310
<i>but I'd been thinking about
what it would have been like...</i>

228
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:44,790
<i>if my life had
turned out differently.</i>

229
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:47,670
Do you ever have
any regrets, Clip?

230
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:50,670
About how your life
has turned out...

231
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:53,710
or about
choices you made?

232
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,790
No!

233
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:58,790
- Oh... no.
- Oh.

234
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:01,870
But I figure I didn't make
all that many choices.

235
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:05,030
You know what my policy is?
Do nothing and see what happens...

236
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:08,950
- and things always seem to turn out fine.
- Yeah, for you.

237
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:12,150
Your problem is that nothing's
ever good enough for you.

238
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:14,910
<i>You've got
the perfect life.</i>

239
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:18,630
You've got a wonderful home,
a terrific wife, a good job...

240
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:21,550
and the best friend
money can buy.

241
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,990
What else could
a guy want?

242
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:27,110
A little excitement
would be nice.

243
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:29,470
I am so mad,
I could scream.

244
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:32,270
Maddie and Heather
were both laid off...

245
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:35,270
due to slow sales
or some bullshit like that.

246
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:38,630
They are laying people off,
making us work double shifts...

247
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:41,910
<i>- to keep production levels up.
- She's got a point.</i>

248
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:44,950
I did an inventory check,
and there's a surplus.

249
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:48,670
Technically, we should be
cutting back on production.

250
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,870
Can you check
into it, Larry?

251
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:53,830
The next person
to be laid off could be me.

252
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:56,590
<i>Looking back,
I should have said no...</i>

253
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,550
<i>but I didn't.</i>

254
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:00,710
I'll look into it.

255
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,550
<i>Because
I'm an idiot.</i>

256
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:04,950
<i>Honey,
come on.</i>

257
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:07,590
What?
She always kisses me.

258
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:09,830
I'm eating.

259
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:12,750
<i>When the head of my
department, Niles Pender...</i>

260
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:15,190
<i>announced he was
raising production levels...</i>

261
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:18,150
<i>I couldn't keep
my big idiot mouth shut.</i>

262
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:20,070
Ahem.

263
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:24,070
A comment, Burrows,
or phlegm rising in your throat?

264
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:27,590
Um, well...

265
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:30,030
just a thought
here, Niles.

266
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,110
<i>Why do we need
more product...</i>

267
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:34,430
when we have
a surplus inventory?

268
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:37,270
On what are you basing
this so-called surplus?

269
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,750
On the fact that...

270
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:47,150
that I recently counted
every box in the warehouse.

271
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:50,710
I would say we have a problem
with our perception of reality.

272
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,950
Sorry to barge in.

273
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:55,710
DoJackie and I
need to be here?

274
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:59,630
Not at all, Mr. Hansen.
Just production details.

275
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:03,310
<i>Leo Hansen owns the company.
He's a very sweet man...</i>

276
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:05,670
<i>but he doesn't have a clue
about what's going on.</i>

277
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,990
Then it's off
to the golf course.

278
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:10,710
Jackie's gonna show me
how to get rid of my slice.

279
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:12,910
I speak for all
of us when I say...

280
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:15,030
that is
wonderful news.

281
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:18,710
What time is that meeting
with Mr. Nakamura?

282
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,270
8:00, sir.

283
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:23,630
But we have a dinner
reservation at 9:00.

284
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:26,750
We have some important
business to finalize, sir.

285
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:28,670
Well...

286
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,630
Well, maybe I'd better
cancel the reservation.

287
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:33,550
That's an
excellent idea.

288
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:37,270
That's what I'll do, then.
Good-bye, y'all.

289
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:41,350
Touchdowns, everyone.

290
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:46,150
Incredible.

291
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:49,750
<i>Since we seem to have
a disagreement over the inventory...</i>

292
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:51,790
I suggest you
check it again.

293
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:56,070
Well, that would take
about 3 or 4 days.

294
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:58,190
<i>I don't see
a problem.</i>

295
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:00,670
Do you see
a problem with that?

296
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,670
<i>Well...</i>

297
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:06,030
do you, Burrows?

298
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:10,550
No, sir.

299
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:14,150
I should have told Niles
about the surplus myself...

300
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:17,950
but the guy scares
the shit out of me.

301
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:20,790
Don't worry.
He's an asshole.

302
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:23,110
I'll make it up
to you somehow.

303
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:26,710
<i>Guess what's playing with
In the Heat of the Night.</i>

304
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:29,550
<i>- What?
- Bonnie and Clyde.</i>

305
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:31,990
We haven't seen it
in about 20 years.

306
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:35,710
<i>- Do you want to go?
- Of course I want to go.</i>

307
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:39,190
Great. I'll see
you later then.

308
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:41,190
<i>All right,
Clip.</i>

309
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:43,390
Oh, and Larry?

310
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,590
<i>You shouldn't
be talking to me.</i>

311
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:48,670
<i>After all, you've got
a lot ofboxes to count.</i>

312
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:52,190
- Thanks for reminding me.
- Heh-heh-heh.

313
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:55,670
Get outta here.
What a jerk.

314
00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:00,190
Excuse me. Would you
mind stepping back?

315
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:03,230
You wouldn't want me to
fork you to death, would you?

316
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:06,350
No.

317
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:09,270
No, we couldn't
have that.

318
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:14,550
After all, we hardly
know each other.

319
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:17,110
Since when
does that matter?

320
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:23,830
All right, you,
get back to work.

321
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,790
I know what
you're thinking.

322
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:28,070
Sometimes,
I get the feeling...

323
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:30,470
<i>I'm missing out
on something.</i>

324
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:34,550
<i>What she's got, you don't need.</i>

325
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:37,430
You sure?

326
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:40,830
Not absolutely...

327
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:43,070
but if I tried
to find out...

328
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:45,270
your mother
would kill me.

329
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:47,870
You're the dad
every kid dreams of.

330
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:50,230
Don't be such
a wise guy.

331
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,590
Petey Fleckman
just got canned.

332
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:54,870
That's 3 guys
since yesterday.

333
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:57,550
Something stinks,
and I don't mean...

334
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:59,950
the meat loaf
in the cafeteria.

335
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:02,030
Yeah, I know.

336
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:04,470
Hey, hey,
look at this.

337
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:07,830
<i>That's the same bunch
he had down here last week.</i>

338
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:10,590
<i>- Who are they?
- Who knows?</i>

339
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:13,150
Niles is trying
to pass them off...

340
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:16,030
as some championship
baseball team from Osaka.

341
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:20,310
<i>One of them thinks Mickey Mantle is
something over a mouse's fireplace.</i>

342
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,350
You're in
management.

343
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:25,270
- Check around a little, will ya?
- Yeah.

344
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:28,750
- I'll see what I can find out.
- You're aces, kid.

345
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:35,150
<i>Looking back, I should
have said no to Dad...</i>

346
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:37,230
<i>but I didn't.</i>

347
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:40,350
<i>I was beginning to think that
maybe something was going on.</i>

348
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:46,750
<i>I decided to look
around Niles'office...</i>

349
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:49,510
<i>to see if I could
find anything.</i>

350
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:52,470
<i>I'd been an idiot
all morning, anyway...</i>

351
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:55,110
<i>so I figured,
why stop now?</i>

352
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,590
Shit.

353
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:45,110
<i>"Leveraged buy out

354
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:47,950
What the hell's
Metasport?

355
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,870
Shit.

356
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:59,190
<i>Why is it, every time you
break into your boss'office...</i>

357
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:01,990
<i>he always
walks in on you?</i>

358
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,790
Lose something,
Burrows?

359
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:10,870
Something
tells me I have.

360
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:18,670
<i>Well, that brings me
back to where I began...</i>

361
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,790
<i>In the middle of nowhere
with a car that won't start.</i>

362
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:24,190
<i>All things
considered...</i>

363
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:27,070
<i>it had turned into
a pretty rotten birthday.</i>

364
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:35,390
<i>But nothing

365
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:38,790
<i>could have prepared me
for what came next.</i>

366
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:54,190
Evening.

367
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:55,910
Hi.

368
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:58,150
You got
a pay phone?

369
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:00,270
Right there.

370
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:02,190
Thanks.

371
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:17,670
Yeah, hi.
It's me again.

372
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,630
I'm gonna need
another tow.

373
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:22,430
<i>I'm on the corner
of Cross and 3rd...</i>

374
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:24,550
<i>next to a bar.</i>

375
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:26,910
Yeah, the station wagon...

376
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:30,390
the big blue
piece of shit.

377
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:32,710
I'll get
a new car.

378
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:34,630
All right.

379
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,550
"Get a new car. "
I've gotta get a new life.

380
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:40,150
Car trouble,
huh?

381
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:42,070
Yeah.

382
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:44,470
Tow truck will
be here in 20 minutes.

383
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:47,270
- Can I get you something?
- I could sure use it.

384
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:49,990
Light beer,
no glass, right?

385
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:52,270
Yeah.
How did you know?

386
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:54,830
Just a guess.

387
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:01,830
Say, don't I know
you from somewhere?

388
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:04,150
You seem familiar
to me, too.

389
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:05,750
Name's Mike.

390
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:08,750
Larry.

391
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:11,990
Larry Burrows, right?
You're the kid...

392
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:15,430
<i>who lost the high school
championship in 1970.</i>

Jesus heavenly Christ.

394
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:21,430
If I'd known
it was a sore point...

395
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:23,830
I wouldn't have
brought it up.

396
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:29,870
Forget it.
I'm getting used to it.

397
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:32,590
This whole day's
been a nightmare.

398
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:36,710
<i>- Care to talk about it?
- It's lots of things.</i>

399
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:39,990
I didn't have my
cereal this morning.

400
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:43,190
<i>Didn't have
my coffee at work.</i>

401
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:46,190
I got fired.

402
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:49,910
It's my 35th birthday,
and everyone forgot.

403
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:52,910
Almost everyone.
I got vomit from Clip.

404
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:54,510
<i>Well...</i>

405
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:57,670
<i>- happy birthday.
- Thanks, Mike.</i>

406
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:00,430
35 years old,
and my life is shit.

407
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:02,270
It can't be
that bad.

408
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:04,630
It's not
that it's bad...

409
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:07,150
it's just that
it's ordinary.

410
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:10,270
I do the same
thing every day.

411
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:13,550
Go to work,
come home;

412
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:16,430
build some model cars
or go bowling;

413
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:18,990
fall asleep
in front of the TV.

414
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:24,430
If I'd have just hit
that goddamn ball...

415
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:27,350
my life would have
turned out a lot better.

416
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:30,030
Some people
believe that...

417
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:33,190
things are the way
they are for a reason.

418
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:35,230
The reason
eludes me.

419
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:39,790
Can I have
another one?

420
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:41,710
Listen...

421
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:44,990
I've got just the thing
for a sober cynic...

422
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:47,710
<i>like yourself.</i>

423
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:51,230
<i>It's a little something

424
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,670

425
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:59,710
<i>"The Spilt Milk. "</i>

426
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:09,630
It's the one drink

427
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:12,510
Very clever, Mike.

428
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:15,470
It does the job.
Try it.

429
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:26,870
So you think your life
would have been better...

430
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:28,830
if you'd hit
the ball, huh?

431
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:31,790
Yeah...

432
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:34,510
a lot better.

433
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:37,030
I swung too late,
that's all.

434
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:41,270
Yeah.

435
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:48,910
If I'd just started
a half-a-second sooner.

436
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:24,310
I did it,
I did it!

437
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:26,830
Yeah!

438
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:37,950
Half-a-second sooner,
and I would have been king.

439
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:42,710
A lousy
half-a-second.

440
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:52,590
I think I'll go outside
and wait for the tow truck.

441
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:55,390
Thanks for the
sympathetic ear, Mike.

442
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:59,350
Anytime, Larry.
That's what I'm here for.

443
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:08,430
Oh, great.

444
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:11,750
They towed
my car already.

445
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:15,150
You'd think they could've
at least come in and told me.

446
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:20,630
Is he closed
already?

447
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:23,470
Ah, damn.
Hey, Mike!

448
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:26,230
Mike, I need
to call a cab!

449
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:45,710
It's paved.

450
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:49,070
What do you know?

451
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:51,830
Old Guzelman
came through after all.

452
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:54,190
Must've found
a mud guy.

453
00:26:57,510 --> 00:27:00,470
Hey, Ellen?

454
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:03,670
Let me in, will ya?
I gotta use the can.

455
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:08,390
Come on, honey.
My key won't work.

456
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:12,750
What the hell are ya doin'
banging on my door?

457
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:15,510
Who are you?
What's going on here?

458
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,790
What have you done
with my wife?

459
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:20,510
What are you
talking about?

460
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:23,710
Look, take whatever
you need and leave.

461
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:26,710
If you don't hurt anybody,
I won't call the cops.

462

Cops?
Man, I am a cop.

463
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:32,830
Just what's
your problem?

464
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:35,790
I don't have a problem.
I live here.

465
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:38,150
What are you doing
in my house?

466
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:41,950
Your house?
Show me some I.D., pal.

467
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:43,870
Yeah, okay.

468
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:46,030
You're gonna
feel like a fool.

469
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:48,230
I've lived here
for over a year.

470
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:50,670
"LawrenceJ. Burrows...

471
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:53,030
<i>"11653 Bonny Meadow Lane...</i>

472
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:55,150
<i>Forest Hills. "</i>

473
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:57,310
Where'd I get
this license?

474
00:27:57,390 --> 00:28:00,150
Probably from the D.M.V.
Where everybody gets theirs.

475
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:02,910
This is my house
and I want to see my wife.

476
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:05,150
Now step
outta my way.

477
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:08,310
Try to come in
and I'll kick your ass.

478
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:12,270
I don't care.
I'm coming in.

479
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:15,510
- No, you're not!
- Yes, I am!

480
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:17,510
<i>- You're not.!
- I am.!</i>

481
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:18,950
Larry?

482
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:21,430
Mike!

483
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:24,350
<i>- What are you doing here?
- We need to talk.</i>

484
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:26,670
I gotta get
in my house.

485
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:29,550
<i>That's one of the things
we need to talk about.</i>

486
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:31,550
You don't
live there.

487
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:33,470
What?

488
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:36,310
Even the cab driver
knows you don't live here.

489
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:38,350
Now beat it!

490
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:45,270
It's all very simple, really.

491
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:47,390
You know that
little incident...

492
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:49,470
you didn't like
about your life?

493
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:51,150
The baseball game?

494
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:53,910
<i>- It's been changed.
- Changed?</i>

495
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:55,950
What do
you mean?

496
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:58,030
You hit
the 3-2 pitch...

497
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,990
<i>out of
the park.</i>

498
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:02,590
That's why I don't
live in my house?

499
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:05,470
Exactly.
When that moment changed...

500
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:08,470
everything else
in your life changed.

501
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:11,870
Ha, ha!
I get it.

502
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:14,230
I get it now.

503
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:16,750
This is great,
just great.

504
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:19,590
What did they
pay you for this?

505
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:23,310
<i>- What does who pay me?
- Ellen and Clipster.</i>

506
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:27,270
This is some kind
of birthday gag, right?

507
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:29,670
This is really great.

508
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:32,510
Who was that big guy
at the house?

509
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:34,430
Another actor?

510
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:37,590
Boy, he scared
the shit out of me.

511
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:40,750
I don't think
you understand.

512
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:43,510
Shhh, I don't want
to hear a thing.

513
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:47,190
I just want to
play along with it.

514
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:51,590
Do you do this a lot,
change people's lives?

515
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:55,710
I've been known to make
a few adjustments now and again.

516
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:12,910
I live in a hotel?

517
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:16,030
It's a private home,
and it's all yours.

518
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:18,030
Yeah, right.

519
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:20,830
Wait here until
I get to the door.

520
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:25,230
- You wouldn't want to miss the expression on my face.
- Not for all the world.

521
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:27,510
I assume you're
taken care of...

522
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:30,390
but here's $5.00.
You were really great.

523
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:34,830
Wow, this must've
cost them a fortune.

524
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:48,750
I'm here at the door
to my new home.

525
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:55,830
I'm Larry Burrows,
but you probably already know that.

526
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:58,030
Yes, of course, sir.

527
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:01,430
Is my wife here?
As if I didn't know.

528
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:03,350
Of course she is.

529
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:10,310
Wow, nice setup.

530
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:14,350
I didn't know you could rent
places like this for parties.

531
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:17,710
- What's your name?
- It's Boswell, sir.

532
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:20,910
Good name.
You pick that yourself?

533
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:24,190
Here, here.
Here's a fin.

534
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:26,910
Get yourself
something nice.

535
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:32,790
<i>- "A fin"?
- Boswell...</i>

536
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:35,390
watch how surprised
I'm gonna be.

537
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:38,710
Get ready with
the Academy Award.

538
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:41,310
Honey, I'm here!

539
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:43,230
It's me!

540
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:46,590
You're home!
I was so worried.

541
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:51,470
Daddy, Daddy,
did you bring us something?

542
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:53,870
Ludwig went
to pick you up...

543
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:57,470
- but they said you'd already left.
- CindyJo.

544
00:31:57,550 --> 00:32:00,150
What are you doing here?
Are you in on this?

545
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:02,270
Where's Clip
and Ellen?

546
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:06,470
Who are Clip and Ellen?
What are you talking about?

547
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:09,870
- My surprise birthday party.
- It's in 2 hours.

548
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:13,390
You told me you didn't
want it to be a surprise...

549
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:15,390
because you
hate surprises.

550
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:23,350
Darling,
what's wrong?

551
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:27,190
Nothing... is wrong.

552
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:32,110
Will you excuse me
a minute?

553
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:44,590
Whew!

554
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:47,150
<i>Mike.!</i>

555
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:50,710
<i>What the hell's
going on?</i>

556
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:53,590
Why is CindyJo
calling me sweetheart?

557
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:56,590
Who are those kids?
What is this place?

558
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:59,390
This is your house.
Those are your children.

559
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:01,630
CindyJo's
your wife.

560
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:06,110
No-o-o!

561
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:08,710
Yes.

562
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:16,750
<i>- Are you all right?
- No, I'm not.</i>

563
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:20,110
I mean, this kind of thing
doesn't happen every day.

564
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:23,270
It is remarkable,
if I do say so myself.

565
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:25,350
<i>I don't
understand.</i>

566
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:27,670
How can my life
change so much...

567
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:30,070
just because
I hit one baseball?

568
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:32,710
You see, Larry,
one's destiny...

569
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:35,150
is a very
complicated thing.

570
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:37,910
Every incident
in a person's life...

571
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:40,590
affects everything else
that follows it.

572
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:44,430
Instead of missing
the baseball, you hit it.

573
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:47,590
Then you became a hero,
married the prom queen...

574
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:49,910
and so on
and so forth...

575
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:54,310
until you find yourself
exactly where you are.

576
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:56,390
So you see...

577
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:59,270
hitting
that baseball...

578
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:03,150
has spun your life off in
an entirely new direction.

579
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:07,030
Are you an angel
or something?

580
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:10,470
Not exactly, no.

581
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:12,190
What are you?

582
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:16,070
Have you ever been
faced with a decision...

583
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:18,270
and you weren't
sure what to do?

584
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:20,750
Sure, plenty of times.

585
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:24,630
And then something inside you made
you choose one direction over another?

586
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:27,110
Yeah.
So?

587
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,030
So that's me.

588
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:33,070
I make the suggestions,
and you make the choices.

589
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:35,710
That's how
destiny works...

590
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:37,790
very subtly.

591
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:41,870
Welcome to your
new life, Larry.

592
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:44,310
I hope
you like it.

593
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:47,150
Mike.

594
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:49,750
<i>Hey, wait a second.</i>

595
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:51,750
Mike, hey!

596
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:54,470
Mike! Mike!

597
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:59,670
What am I supposed
to do now?

598
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:21,430
Hi, it's me again.
Larry Burrows.

599
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:24,230
Why did you
run out of the house?

600
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:28,710
Um...

601
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:32,710
I forgot to
tip the cabbie.

602
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:36,670
You took a cab?
Why didn't you wait for Ludwig?

603
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:38,590
Ludwig?

604
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:43,470
Oh, Ludwig,
good old Ludwig.

605
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:47,430
I didn't wait for
Ludwig because...

606
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:51,910
I can't remember his...

607
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:54,550
face.

608
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:58,710
You must be very tired,
sweetheart.

609
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:00,790
Yes.

610
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:02,750
Go into the library...

611
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:05,070
and have a nice drink
before dinner.

612
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:06,990
Okay.

613
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:15,630
By the way,
where's the library?

614
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:18,790
It's over there.

615
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:25,110
Great.
Yeah, thanks.

616
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:34,270
So, I'll just
be in the library...

617
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:36,350
having a drink.

618
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:38,590
Thanks again.

619
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:43,870
Geez!

620
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:53,990
I must belong to
the Book-of-the-Month Club.

621
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:18,550
Oh, Boswell!
How you doin'?

622
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:21,550
Am I glad to see you.

623
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:24,790
Your evening drink, sir.

624
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:27,030
- What is it?
- Armagnac.

625
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:29,270
1953.

626
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:34,670
Whoa!
I'm going to pass.

627
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,590
What I could use is
a nice cold brewsky.

628
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:39,990
<i>- I'm parched.
- A brewsky, sir?</i>

629
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:42,230
Light, if you've got it,
no glass.

630
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:44,550
Can you tell me
where the can is?

631
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:47,550
<i>Had a couple of drinks
after work. Know what I mean?</i>

632
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:50,190
- The can, sir?
- Yeah, the bathroom.

633
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:53,670
Well, sir,
there are 15 bathrooms.

634
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:55,990
15 bathrooms?

635
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:58,910
Did you have any
particular one in mind?

636
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:03,510
No. Nothing special.
The nearest one will do.

637
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:09,150
Through that door,
down the hall.

638
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:11,270
Thank you.

639
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:15,470
Brewsky.

640
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:23,670
A closet.

641
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,950
Another closet.

642
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:34,710
15 bathrooms,
you'd think I could find one.

643
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:41,670
Maybe this is it.

644
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:04,670
My God, I've died
and gone to heaven.

645
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:08,910
Excuse me, sir.

646
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:12,670
Would you like to go
for a ride before dinner?

647
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:15,630
No, thanks.

648
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:22,990
Tell me, who do
these cars belong to?

649
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:25,030
They belong
to you, sir.

650
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:28,510
- Get the hell out of here!
- As you wish.

651
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:50,550
Hey, wow...

652
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:53,230
a big hunk of cheese!

653
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:55,150
It's just what I wanted.

654
00:39:57,510 --> 00:40:01,270
- It's Stilton, L.J.
- Thank you, Mr. Stilton.

655
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:05,430
It goes great with tomato,
mayonnaise, and pumpernickel.

656
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:09,390
Thank you for remembering
my birthday.

657
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:12,070
The gifts are terrific.

658
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:14,030
Thank you, Mr. Stilton.

659
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:17,070
- And you, Mr. Steuben, for the big hunk of glass.
- My pleasure.

660
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:22,790
Hey, L.J.

661
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:25,790
Dad, you're here.

662
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:29,790
Many happy returns.
Swell shindig!

663
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:32,190
Say hello to Gina.
Gina, my kid.

664
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:34,270
Very nice to make
your acquaintance.

665
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:38,870
We met in Morocco, Club Med,
know what I mean.

666
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:43,670
Will you excuse us?

667
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:48,390
- Go have more caviar.
- Okay.

668
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:53,190
Nice to have
met you, L.J.

669
00:40:57,910 --> 00:41:02,150
<i>She loves caviar.
Thinks it's salty candy.</i>

670
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:05,150
I haven't told her
it's fish eggs.

671
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:09,350
Are you crazy
bringing her here?

672
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:12,630
What if mom found out?
She'd skin you alive!

673
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:15,430
Relax. We signed
the papers a week ago.

674
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:18,390
I'm free and clear.
What do you think... hot stuff!

675
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:20,310
<i>What papers?</i>

676
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:22,270
Divorce papers.

677
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:24,910
You and mom
are divorced?

678
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:28,150
Of course.
Nothing lasts forever.

679
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:30,710
You told me so.

680
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:33,270
- I said that?
- You were right, too.

681
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:35,950
Can you spot me 10 grand?

682
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:38,750
Gina's killin' me
to take her to St. Bart's.

683
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:41,550
You're aces, kid.

684
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:52,670
Your guests are wondering
if you're all right.

685
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:55,710
What's
the matter?

686
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:57,710
My parents
are divorced.

687
00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:02,230
Of course.
Everybody's parents are.

688
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:04,870
<i>Go be a good host.</i>

689
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:10,030
Excuse me a moment.

690
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:17,830
You didn't tell me
they were divorced!

691
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:20,510
This is quite good caviar.

692
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:22,670
My parents are divorced,
for Christ's sake!

693
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:24,470
I know.

694
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:28,110
I didn't expect that!

695
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:31,350
Is there anything else
that will come as a shock?

696
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:34,470
It all will,
to some degree.

697
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:37,190
<i>- To what degree?
- You'll see.</i>

698
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:41,550
Things changed. You have to
take the bad with the good.

699
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:44,590
Didn't think everything
would be perfect, did you?

700
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:47,630
Well, I...

701
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:49,750
I suppose not.

702
00:42:49,830 --> 00:42:53,710
This is your life,
Larry.

703
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:56,470
Learn to enjoy
what you've got.

704
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:10,590
A brewsky, sir?

705
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:14,070
Good night.

706
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:16,150
Bye-bye.

707
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:19,390
I've got some great friends,
don't you think?

708
00:43:19,470 --> 00:43:21,630
They give
terrific gifts!

709
00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:25,230
You have
one more coming.

710
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:33,990
I'll see you upstairs.

711
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:45,670
CindyJo?

712
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:49,590
<i>Are you in here?</i>

713
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:54,950
<i>I'm over here.</i>

714
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:17,470
Happy birthday, darling.

715
00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:19,950
God help me.

716
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:40,590
Morning, Bos.
Sleep well?

717
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:42,550
I didn't,
if know what I mean?

718
00:44:42,590 --> 00:44:45,590
I know exactly
what you mean.

719
00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:49,430
This house has
a lot of big rooms.

720
00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:55,950
Isn't this a little drab
for such a happy guy?

721
00:44:55,990 --> 00:44:59,670
You always wear blue pinstripe
to board meetings.

722
00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:01,710
Board meetings?

723
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:05,150
Son of a bitch.
I'm married to CindyJo!

724
00:45:05,230 --> 00:45:09,230
That means I'm president
of Liberty Republic.

725
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:10,190
Indeed, sir.

726
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:11,950
For some time now.

727
00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:14,590
Oh, yeah.

728
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:17,030
I mean,
I knew that.

729
00:45:17,110 --> 00:45:21,510
I'm so happy about it,
I like to remind myself.

730
00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:33,110
Oh.

731
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:38,630
Good morning, kids.

732
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:40,110
Morning, Father.

733
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:44,950
Ah, crescent rolls!

734
00:45:44,990 --> 00:45:47,030
Very nice.

735
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:49,590
Very nice,
indeed.

736
00:45:52,430 --> 00:45:54,590
Larry Burrows.
How you doing?

737
00:45:54,670 --> 00:45:57,070
Nice to
meet you.

738
00:45:59,110 --> 00:46:01,190
What's this?
Cream of Wheat?

739
00:46:01,270 --> 00:46:03,310
It's cappuccino, Daddy.

740
00:46:03,390 --> 00:46:06,070
Italian dark roast coffee
and steamed whole milk.

741
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:08,950
Right, I knew that.

742
00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:14,910
That'll keep you up
the rest of your life!

743
00:46:17,590 --> 00:46:21,790
It's nice. Should you
kids be drinking this?

744
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:25,070
We always do.

745
00:46:25,110 --> 00:46:28,630
I guess it's
all right, then.

746
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:30,670
Morning!

747
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:31,990
Hi.

748
00:46:32,070 --> 00:46:35,830
You were wonderful
last night.

749
00:46:35,870 --> 00:46:38,750
So were you.

750
00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:41,590
I had no idea you could
do that with Cool Whip.

751
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:52,270
Wow!

752
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:55,070
I told you we could beat
that train through the crossing.

753
00:46:55,150 --> 00:46:56,870
So you did, sir.

754
00:46:56,950 --> 00:47:01,110
Give yourself a raise.
One hundred bucks a week!

755
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:03,350
You're all right.

756
00:47:08,310 --> 00:47:10,550
Wow!

757
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:17,950
<i>This is my office?</i>

758
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:25,070
This will take
some getting used to.

759
00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:34,550
<i>Nice desk.!</i>

760
00:47:37,870 --> 00:47:40,430
I wonder
how it works.

761
00:47:42,510 --> 00:47:44,910
There's got to be an
"on" switch somewhere.

762
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:53,230
How about that?
The desk is wired to my ass.

763
00:47:56,950 --> 00:47:59,790
<i>Good morning, Mr. Burrows.</i>

764
00:47:59,870 --> 00:48:04,150
<i>- Hi. How are you?
- Can I get you something?</i>

765
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:08,470
No, I'm fine.
Coffee!

766
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:10,590
I'd really like
a cup of coffee.

767
00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:15,030
<i>Right away. Mr. Pender and
Mr. Flick are on their way.</i>

768
00:48:15,110 --> 00:48:18,270
You're kidding!
Those jerks still work here?

769
00:48:18,350 --> 00:48:20,430
<i>- Pardon?
- Nothing. Nothing at all.</i>

770
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:23,830
Do me a favor.

771
00:48:23,910 --> 00:48:27,830
Find out if Clip Metzler
or Ellen Burr...

772
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:30,790
Ripley... Ellen Ripley,
work here.

773
00:48:30,870 --> 00:48:33,750
<i>Metzler works in accounting.
I'll have to check on Ripley.</i>

774
00:48:33,830 --> 00:48:37,390
Thanks, and tell Pender
and Flick that, uh...

775
00:48:37,430 --> 00:48:39,350
I can't be disturbed.

776
00:48:39,430 --> 00:48:41,830
<i>- I'm too busy. I've got lots of buttons to push.
- Yes, sir.</i>

777
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:44,110
Over and out.

778
00:48:51,990 --> 00:48:53,510
Let's see.

779
00:48:56,310 --> 00:48:57,790
Where's the bar?

780
00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:04,750
I'm going to love
this place.

781
00:49:08,630 --> 00:49:11,230
All right!
The good stuff.

782
00:49:18,110 --> 00:49:22,430
I know you.
You're the forklift girl.

783
00:49:22,510 --> 00:49:24,870
Great, thanks.

784
00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:28,270
I've been trying to get
regular coffee for days.

785
00:49:28,310 --> 00:49:31,710
Then again,
maybe I don't need coffee.

786
00:49:31,790 --> 00:49:33,950
Where the hell
were you last night?

787
00:49:34,030 --> 00:49:37,350
I waited until midnight,
and went to bed... alone.

788
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:40,630
I'm sorry.

789
00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:42,630
Jewel!

790
00:49:42,710 --> 00:49:44,470
Forgotten
my name already?

791
00:49:44,550 --> 00:49:48,270
Jewel,
I knew that.

792
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:51,190
I'm real,
real sorry.

793
00:49:51,270 --> 00:49:53,270
I guess I
couldn't make it.

794
00:49:53,350 --> 00:49:55,550
- I had this party...
- Couldn't make it?

795
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:58,230
Were you out with that
Ripley bitch?

796
00:49:58,310 --> 00:50:00,390
Does she works here?

797
00:50:00,470 --> 00:50:02,950
No, she does not
work here.

798
00:50:03,030 --> 00:50:04,910
If she suddenly
starts working here...

799
00:50:04,990 --> 00:50:06,950
you're going to live
to regret it.

800
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:10,350
What do you say
we double your salary?

801
00:50:10,430 --> 00:50:13,590
I know what
you're capable of, L.J.

802
00:50:13,670 --> 00:50:15,550
Don't mess with me...

803
00:50:15,630 --> 00:50:18,150
or you'll find out
what I'm capable of.

804
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:21,550
Am I making myself
perfectly clear?

805
00:50:24,710 --> 00:50:27,990
<i>- Perfectly.
- We need to talk.</i>

806
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:30,230
Whoa.

807
00:50:30,310 --> 00:50:33,990
Hi, guys.
Come in.

808
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:35,750
I'm glad to see you.

809
00:50:35,830 --> 00:50:39,510
About the plan, I've got
to tell Bob either way.

810
00:50:39,550 --> 00:50:42,150
I think it's a big mistake
to set up New Jersey.

811
00:50:42,230 --> 00:50:44,230
We need to talk
about the country club.

812
00:50:44,310 --> 00:50:46,350
We have to go over
the Nakamura deal...

813
00:50:46,430 --> 00:50:49,950
before we sign the papers.
Are we on?

814
00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:52,910
- For New Jersey?
- No, for golf.

815
00:50:52,990 --> 00:50:55,030
Excuse me.

816
00:50:55,110 --> 00:50:57,750
<i>Am I disturbing you?</i>

817
00:50:57,790 --> 00:50:59,910
Mr. Hansen,
come in.

818
00:51:02,070 --> 00:51:03,950
Come in.
Mr. Hansen!

819
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:07,190
<i>Come on in,
please.</i>

820
00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:10,310
What can I
do for you?

821
00:51:10,390 --> 00:51:14,230
I wanted to apologize for
not appearing at your party.

822
00:51:14,310 --> 00:51:16,590
My ulcer
was acting up.

823
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:21,270
You didn't miss a thing. I got
some cheese and a glass thing.

824
00:51:21,350 --> 00:51:23,350
- A what?
- You know...

825
00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:25,390
<i>Excuse me.</i>

826
00:51:25,470 --> 00:51:29,550
We should go.
We tee off in 15 minutes.

827
00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:32,990
Oh, right.

828
00:51:33,070 --> 00:51:36,470
Would you like to
golf with us?

829
00:51:36,550 --> 00:51:39,110
<i>- I play golf, you know.
- Really?</i>

830
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:42,550
- You want to play golf with me?
- Sure. Come on.

831
00:51:42,630 --> 00:51:44,590
I can help you get rid
of that slice or whatever.

832
00:52:04,950 --> 00:52:07,110
It slipped.

833
00:52:09,590 --> 00:52:11,510
Can I use yours?

834
00:52:12,710 --> 00:52:15,430
<i>- Sure.
- Thanks.</i>

835
00:52:15,510 --> 00:52:17,910
It's not like
a baseball bat.
