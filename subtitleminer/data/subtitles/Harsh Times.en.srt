What's up, Sylvia?

Cute little outfit.

28
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:03,797
You look nice.

29
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:04,798
Mike's in
the bedroom.

Man, I said
you look nice.

33
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,643
I have a court
appearance, Jim.

34
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:17,811
Well, you just
give 'em hell.

00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:24,151
Hey.

36
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:26,237
Spiffy duds, huh?

38
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:29,573
You look like
a gift-wrapped turd.

39
00:07:29,573 --> 00:07:31,408
Now please leave me alone.
I have to concentrate.

40
00:07:31,408 --> 00:07:33,244
I have two filings
and a deposition today.

41
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:34,912
Play nice, kids.

42
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:37,915
What up, dog?

43
00:07:37,998 --> 00:07:40,000
- Nothing. Just got back.
- Cool. Cool.

44
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,502
How was Mexico, dog?

45
00:07:41,585 --> 00:07:43,921
Oh, it was a dream, man.

46
00:07:45,589 --> 00:07:47,007
- Loving my woman.
- Right.

47
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:48,759
That's it.
I'm out of here.

48
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:51,595
Those are copies
of your resumé.

49
00:07:51,595 --> 00:07:52,680
Pass them out like candy.

50
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:54,098
'Cause I can always
print up more.

51
00:07:54,181 --> 00:07:55,933
And just call me
if anything happens, okay?

52
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:58,769
And no drinking.

53
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:01,272
Come on, baby, be cool.

54
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:02,523
Honey, I'm serious.

55
00:08:02,606 --> 00:08:04,692
No drinking. Okay?

56
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:07,027
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

57
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:11,198
Good luck.

58
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:14,451
Your suit's fine, okay?

59
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:22,126
Dude, she called me
a gift-wrapped turd.

60
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:23,377
(laughing)

61
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,712
Don't be fucking
with her, dude.

62
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:26,547
She's pissed.

63
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:28,048
Why is she on
the warpath? Dog...

64
00:08:29,216 --> 00:08:31,135
I didn't look for work
yesterday, dude.

65
00:08:31,218 --> 00:08:33,971
Sold some of her CDs,
bought a couple of 40s

66
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:35,806
and a pack of GPCs.

67
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:36,974
Caught a buzz
and watched

68
00:08:37,057 --> 00:08:38,976
my Chicago Vs. Lakers tapes.

69
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,228
(laughs):
That's on you, homie.

70
00:08:41,228 --> 00:08:43,480
We didn't even
hang yesterday.

71
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,982
I was out of the country.

72
00:08:45,065 --> 00:08:46,984
So? My old lady still
thinks it's your fault.

73
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,235
Huh? Huh? Hmm?

74
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:50,237
Come on, dude, let's get
the fuck out of here

75
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:51,488
and find my ass
some employment.

76
00:08:51,488 --> 00:08:52,907
It's cool you driving me around?

77
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:54,491
Yeah, dude, it's cool.
It's no trouble.

78
00:08:54,491 --> 00:08:58,162

80
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,664
Breakfast.

81
00:09:00,664 --> 00:09:02,500
Oh... ho, ho...

82
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,335
Dog.

83
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:06,337
<i>No pisto for me, dude.</i>

84
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:08,506
Today's a no-pounding day.
You heard the woman.

85
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,341
Good. More for me.

86
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:14,845
Fuck it.

87
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,681
<i>Salud.
Salud.</i>

88
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,853
Man, hope they put me in
the next class or I'm fucked.

89
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:24,688
I can't pay my rent.

90
00:09:24,688 --> 00:09:27,691
Landlady's about to pull
a gauge on my ass.

91
00:09:27,691 --> 00:09:30,194
What happened to all that money
you saved in the army, dude?

92
00:09:30,277 --> 00:09:33,113
The tax-free shit?

93
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:35,950
Man, bro, this fucking
ride cleaned me out.

94
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,701
I guess we drank
up the rest.

95
00:09:37,701 --> 00:09:39,370
(chuckles):
Dumb ass.

96
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:40,663
(laughing)

97
00:09:40,704 --> 00:09:42,540
Cops better start
paying you, dude.

98
00:09:42,581 --> 00:09:44,041
You spend enough
fucking time with them.

99
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,460
They better start kicking me
down some paychecks, man.

100
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,629
They got me hopping through
hoops, you know?

101
00:09:48,712 --> 00:09:50,965
"Come in for a test."
"Come back in two weeks."

102
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:52,800
Another test, another two weeks.

103
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,301
Fuck.

104
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:55,386
Shit gets real,

105
00:09:55,427 --> 00:09:56,720
you be hating life.

106
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,722
Party time will be over.

107
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:01,475
Dude, you don't know how much

108
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,561
I'm looking forward
to this shit.

109
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:05,896
You know, I'll be super recruit.

110
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,773
I was jumping
out of choppers

111
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:09,066
in the mountains,
taking down

112
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:12,069
hard motherfuckers,
you know?

113
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:14,822
I'll be laughing my way through
LAPD's reindeer games.

114
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:17,575
Shit, they're
gonna love me.

115
00:10:17,616 --> 00:10:19,910
Yeah, yeah, you're gonna
fucking love them, dude.

116
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,996
Ah, fuck you.

117
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,415
I'm going to love my old lady.

118
00:10:24,456 --> 00:10:26,250
I'm gonna marry homegirl.

119
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:28,919
Import her ass.

120
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,421
Oh, come on, man.

121
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:31,922
Dude, what happened
to all the honeys

122
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:33,716
we were gonna pimp
with your badge, dog?

123
00:10:33,757 --> 00:10:34,758
You're fucking up the plan.

124
00:10:34,758 --> 00:10:37,178
I've been thinking, you know?

125
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:39,430
Love's about sacrifice.

126
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:42,474
Only true measure of it.

127
00:10:42,474 --> 00:10:44,018
What would you do for Sylvia?

128
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,688
Get a job.

129
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:49,607
- Mm...
- Nine to fucking five.

130
00:10:49,648 --> 00:10:51,442
Yeah.

131
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:52,943
That's love.

132
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:05,873
Hey.

133
00:11:10,377 --> 00:11:13,881
Good morning.

134
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,302
MIKE:
So when do you officially

135
00:11:18,385 --> 00:11:20,054
hand your ass over to the Man?

136
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:23,974
"Mr. Jim Davis,
we regret to inform...

137
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:28,395
I had two beers, right?

138
00:11:28,395 --> 00:11:29,813
Yeah.

139
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,148
Going fucking
blind or something.

140
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:33,150
Okay, this letter
says, quoting...

141
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:38,489
"no longer eligible
as a police officer candidate."

142
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:41,033
What the fuck does that mean?

143
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:43,077
Come on, dude.

144
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:45,746
"no longer eligible"? I mean,
what does that sound like?

145
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:46,997
They pulled the plug, dude.

146
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:51,085
No, no...

147
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:52,628
Why?

148
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:56,006
Oh, man, I'll bet you...

149
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:58,092
I'll bet you it's
'cause I'm white.

150
00:11:58,133 --> 00:12:00,261
I bet it's 'cause
you're a dick.

151
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,012
No, no, no, Mike,
you don't understand.

152
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:03,848
I am fucked.

153
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:05,850
I got to get married.

154
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:09,854
Okay? INS won't let me
bring Marta across

155

unless I got employment.

156

I promised her.

This fucks up my plan.

158
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:16,527
This is fucking bullshit, okay?

159
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,029
This... these fucking
assholes...

160
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:22,366
These fucking assholes!

What the fuck

This is fucking typical

00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:37,548
Fucking dick.

168
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:38,549
Yo, yo,

169
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,634
Jim, Jim...

170
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:43,053
I'm gonna fucking kick your
teeth down your puke hole!

171
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:45,556
You fucking want some?

172
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:48,809
Jim, Jim, dude.

173
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:50,060
Kick back, dude.

174
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:52,730
The fucking light is green.
Get the fuck in the car.

175
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,064
Man, fuck.
- You're going to catch

176
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:55,232
a case doing that shit, man.

177
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:56,483
What the fuck were you doing?

178
00:12:56,483 --> 00:12:58,319
Fuck the LAPD, man.

179
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,321
What's up with Pasadena,
Pomona, Santa Ana and all that?

180
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:02,239
Oh, no, fuck the sticks.

181
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,241
L.A. City's the shit.

182
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:05,910
Hey, Sheriff's Department.

183
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:08,579
It's good enough for the INS
and still basically L.A., right?

184
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:12,833
Yeah, Sheriff's Department,
yeah.

185
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:16,086
They make you work
the jails the first two years

186
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,171
or something.

187
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:18,589
I could be cracking heads

188
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,424
up at the Honor Ranch.

189
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:23,761
I'll give 'em a call,
start testing.

190
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,930
Yeah.

191
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,348
That's right.

192
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:30,267
Yo, it's just
a minor setback, right?

193
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:32,686
Quit trippin', dude.

194
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:34,855
Shit.

195
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:38,025
Hey, you know what
I want to do?

196
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:39,610
What?

197
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:42,613
I want to get fucked up.

198
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:44,281
Me, too, man.

199
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:47,117
I got to find a job and placate
my baby, you know.

200
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:48,953
Sylvia's going
to kick your ass?

201
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:50,621
Come on, big man,
she'll be cool.

202
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:53,374
Come on.

203
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:57,044
(Korean pop music playing)

204
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:04,468
- Bye, Nicole.
- Bye.

205
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:11,976
Let me get a couple
of singles, too, please.

206
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,978
Sorry, you buy whole pack.

207
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:15,896
Be cool, dude.

208
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:17,147
If I buy a whole pack

209
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:18,816
I'm gonna want
to smoke it.

210
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:21,151
I just want a couple
of smokes with my beer.

211
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:22,903
City give me $1,500 ticket.

212
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:23,904
No more.

213
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,990
(speaking Korean)

214
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,011
(speaking Korean)

215
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:48,345
Asshole.

216
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,184
(speaking Korean)

217
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:55,853
(yelling)

218
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:59,190
(gunshots)

219
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:11,285
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

220
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:12,703
Oh, shit.

221
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,455
That fucking gangster, man.

222
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:17,291
Homeboy just ran
a six second four-forty.

223
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:20,044
Damn, the chino looked
fucking pissed, man.

224
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,962
You think we'll be able
to go back there?

225
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,797
I hate that shit.

226
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:26,717
Fuckin' chino lookin' at us
like we were gonna bust him?

227
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:28,719
Come on, dude.
We're wearin' suits, man.

228
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:30,054
We totally look like cops.

229
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,722
He said he got fined
for that shit.

230
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:32,973
He was just being cautious.

231
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:37,311
<i>Well, we got pisto,
we got frajos.</i>

232
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,396
Only one thing missin'.

233
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:41,232
Be-at-ches.

234
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:43,901
Oh, yeah, I mean
besides bitches, man.

235
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:46,237
<i>Yesca?
Mm-hmm.</i>

236
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:47,905
Bingo.

237
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:50,241
I need to feel
some reefer madness.

238
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:53,077
You sure you want
to score some bud, dude?

239
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:55,246
You haven't smoked out
since like forever, man.

240
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:58,833
I said I want
to get fucked up, man.

241
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,584
Fuck this purity bullshit.

242
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:05,005
Yeah... fuck purity.

243
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:09,593
Aw, man, look at this
zero-head, dog.

244
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:10,761
Stupid-ass cholo.

245
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:12,096
Look at that.

246
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:15,432
That dude's slangin', dog.

247
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:18,853
Want to get
a dime?

248
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:22,022
JIM:
No, I want it all.

249
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:30,114
Go for the stash, man.

250
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:39,456
Whoa, go, go, go.

251
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:41,125
Hey, hey, yo, yo.

252
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,294
That's my shit!

253
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,045
Fuck.

254
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,630
(laughing)

255
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:48,465
Outstanding.

256
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:50,634
Out-fucking-standing.

257
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:52,052
That shit was slick.

258
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,138
That motherfucker
just got schooled.

259
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:56,223
Bitch-ass cholo.

260
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:57,808
- Check this shit out, huh?
- Yeah.

261
00:16:57,892 --> 00:17:00,144
Nice motherfucking haul.
You see that shit, huh?

262
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,980
Mm. It's not laced either.

263
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:03,981
Smell that shit.

264
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,149
Smell that motherfucking shit.

265
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,234
We just burned my car.

266
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:08,986
We go back there,
we're gonna get shot.

267
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:09,987
Yeah, no shit.

268
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:10,988
Man, bust that light.

269
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:12,823
Roll that shit up.

270
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,825
Yeah, yeah, Cool.

271
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:16,577
Yo, let's drop off
some resumés first.

272
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:17,828
Then we'll smoke out, dude.

273
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:18,996
Some resumés.

274
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,164
Yeah.

275
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:22,333
Ah, man, fresh air.

276
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,501
Look.

277
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,419
Oh! They're
dropped off, man.

278
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:26,670
You fucking asshole, man.

279
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,005
I got to get
a fucking job, man.

280
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,340
What's your problem, man?

281
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,674
What the fuck are
you doing, dickhead.

282
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:31,842
Yo, Mike, first day looking--

283
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:34,512
nobody ever gets a job
their first day looking.

284
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:38,182
Come on, don't
sweat it, man.

285
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:41,352
Hey, I can't
fuck around tomorrow.

286
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:42,603
I got to get a job for sure.

287
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:43,854
This is your job, man.

288
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:45,272
So act like a fucking
professional,

289
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:47,441
spark up the goods, 'cause we
got a lot of work to do.

290
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:59,787
It's harsh. It's good, though.

291
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,465
You okay?

292
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,467
How are those lungs, baby?

293
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:15,219
There it is.

294
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,888
That magic feeling.

295
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,828
Damn, look at that bitch.

296
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,580
Oh, damn.

297
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:48,836
Fuck, yeah.

298
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,421
She's fucking good.

299
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:53,090
I bet she got skills.
I want to get laid.

300
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:56,260
You just saw your woman.

301
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:57,761
Only hit her once, man.

302
00:18:57,761 --> 00:19:01,182
We can't go nowhere alone.
They got me sleeping in the car.

303
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:05,936
Family's got that ass
under guard, huh?

304
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,104
Lock and key.

305
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,940
Fuck, I want to get laid.

306
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:13,110
Pay a visit
to my harem, huh?

307
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,278
Online, pornmeister.

308
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,905
Uh-uh, let's go
to Letty's pad, man.

309
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,781
How much you want to bet
I hit it.

310
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:19,617
- She won't, dog.
- How much you want to bet?

311
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:20,993
She won't give you shit, dog.

312
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,620
You big time
fucked her over.

313
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:25,414
Aw, man, I popped that poodahey.

314
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:28,667
I got that mind control, man.

315
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:32,296
How much you want to bet
I get back up in it?

316
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:33,797
20 bucks?

317
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:35,132
You ain't got 20 bucks.

318
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:37,134
So, neither do you, man.

319
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:38,969
Come on, shake on that shit.

320
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:41,388
Come on.

321
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,724
What the fuck, let's go.

322
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:44,975
(knocking)

323
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:46,393
I got it.

324
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:49,021
What's up, Patty?

325
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:51,982
<i>- Y tu hermana?
- She ain't here.</i>

326
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:53,567
<i>Y sabes que?</i>

327
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,653
You're not welcome
in this house.

328
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:58,822
Sure, Patty.

329
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:00,991
I'd love to come in.

330
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:03,744
Thank you.

331
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,996
Are they here?

332
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,296
<i>You're looking fine,
as fuck, chulas.</i>

333
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:16,507
Don't... don't touch
me, please.

334
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:19,176
Hey, hey.

335
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:22,847
You got to get out of here.

336
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:24,849
Letty...

337
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:28,018
I just wanted
to see you again.

338
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:34,024
<i>Hey, Patty, you want to grab
me a pisto or something?</i>

339
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:36,068
I ain't grabbing you shit.

340
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,444
Oh, you still got
a mouth, huh?

341
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,530
Maybe one day you'll learn
how to keep it shut.

342
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:42,783
Laters. I'm going to my room.

343
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:46,078
You know you have to run
his ass out of here.

344
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:50,708
Baby.

345
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,046
Let's sit down.

346
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:06,140
No, no, no.

347
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:10,227
So, um...

348
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:12,146
You a cop yet?

349
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:13,731
I'm working on it.

350
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:16,066
<i>Y tu?</i>

351
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:19,069
<i>Que andas haciendo?</i>

352
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:21,488
Well, you know, I'm going
to L.A. Trade Tech.

353
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:24,158
It's good you're doing
positive shit.

354
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:38,506
What, after everything
I don't get a kiss?

355
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:42,259
It's because of everything
you can't get a kiss.

356
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:44,428
Oh, come on, come here.

357
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:47,681
Yeah.

358
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:53,521
Don't.

359
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:56,273
Jim, I got a boyfriend.

360
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,108
Who?

361
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,444
Flaco.

362
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:01,445
You're back with that

363
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:03,781
piece of shit after
what he did, Letty?

364
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:07,284
You're not fucking him, are you?

365
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,620
Please tell me no.

366
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,456
Yes. So... just go.

367
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:14,291
'Cause there's nothing
here for you, Jim.

368
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:17,795
See?

369
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:19,129
Okay?

370
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,965
I don't believe
this shit, Letty.

371
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:22,800
You're too good for that.

372
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:30,099
(car horn blaring)

373
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,141
You gotta go.

374
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,977
Go. Please!

375
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,144
Let me talk to them.

376
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:36,146
No, Jim, don't
be stupid. Please.

377
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:40,484
<i>Okay? Largate. Just go.</i>

378
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:47,575
I guess it's later days.

379
00:22:57,084 --> 00:23:00,004
<i>Largate. Just go!</i>

380
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:02,548
<i>Flaco, the pinchi guero's here!</i>

381
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,842
<i>Apuarte, Jim!
Hurry up!</i>

382
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:06,927
- Fuck him up!
- I got him!

383
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:28,866
Fucking white boy!

384
00:23:31,702 --> 00:23:33,704
What's up, faggot?!

385
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:36,540
We're going to fuck you up!

386
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:38,542
(all shouting)

387
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:42,379
Yo! pop the trunk

388
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:43,631
so I can handle this shit!

389
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:45,382
<i>Fuck you, puto!</i>

390
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:47,051
I'll bust you!

391
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:49,053
Leave him alone!

392
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:53,057
Pop the fucking trunk!

393
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:59,230
(grunting)

394
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,909
Jim!

395
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:13,494
(gunshot)

396
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:15,579
Oh, you fucked up!

397
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:17,748
Get your fucking knees
down on the curb now!

398
00:24:17,832 --> 00:24:19,416
Get the fuck
over there, man!

399
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,418
Don't fucking move unless you
want your brains hanging out!

400
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:22,586
What's your problem, Flaco?

401
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:25,589
Motherfucker!

402
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,591
Fucking knees on the curb, man!

403
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:31,011
That's right!

404
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:35,099
Interlock your fingers
behind your heads, Flaco!

405
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:37,685
You deaf fuck!

406
00:24:41,355 --> 00:24:42,523
Yo, Mike.

407
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:43,858
Yeah?

408
00:24:43,858 --> 00:24:45,276
Do up their ride.

409
00:24:45,276 --> 00:24:48,195
Freeze, bitch!

410
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:51,198
I'm going to take that big ass
of yours home,

411
00:24:51,282 --> 00:24:53,450
hit it for a minute, you know?

412
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,785
Fuck off!

413
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:55,786
Now you got it.

414
00:24:58,205 --> 00:25:00,791
Yo, relax, homie.

415
00:25:02,126 --> 00:25:06,130
You break Letty's heart,
I'm coming for your mom.

416
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,298
Fuck!

417
00:25:09,884 --> 00:25:11,969
<i>Hey, haina.</i>

418
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:13,137
Whoo!

419
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:14,722
Fuck off!
Oh, yeah?

420
00:25:14,722 --> 00:25:16,640
What you got down here?

421
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:18,225
(whistles):
Oh...

422
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:19,810
Liking that.

423
00:25:23,898 --> 00:25:26,901
Damn! Those are
badass kicks, dog.

424
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:29,820
Lucky you got little bitch feet,

425
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,239
else I'd be stomping around
in them motherfuckers.

426
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:34,158
<i>- Fuck you, puto.
- Huh?</i>

427
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:35,826
- Yeah. Fuck you.
- Yes?

428
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:40,664
You fucking stay still!

429
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:43,000
Bitches! If you didn't have
that fucking gun,

430
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,586
<i>ese, it wouldn't
be about shit, homie.</i>

431
00:25:45,586 --> 00:25:47,505
Not fucking shit!

432
00:25:47,505 --> 00:25:50,007
Hey, later, Patty!

433
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:51,842
I hope you're not
pregnant, but you know

434
00:25:51,926 --> 00:25:53,010
you wanted me to blow in you.

435
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:54,178
Fuck you!

436
00:25:54,178 --> 00:25:55,846
Bye, Letty!

437
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:04,939
<i>Salud.</i>

438
00:26:04,939 --> 00:26:06,273
<i>Salud.</i>

439
00:26:10,528 --> 00:26:12,613
Divvy up the bounty, dude.
I know you got some cash.

440
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,376
I know I got more than that.

441
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:29,463
Yeah. Here we go.

442
00:26:29,547 --> 00:26:30,798
Shit.

443
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:33,050
That's my pussy
she's giving away there.

444
00:26:34,969 --> 00:26:36,804
Homeboy uses extra large.

445
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:38,556
Man, that's it?
Next time,

446
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:40,224
jack someone with a job.

447
00:26:40,224 --> 00:26:43,894
Well, fuck you.
What did you get, their lunch?

448
00:26:43,978 --> 00:26:45,646
Check it out.

449
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:48,732
Holy shit.
You're kidding me.

450
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:58,075
Whoo! It's a fucking
Ruger P-94. Nine millimeter.

451
00:26:58,075 --> 00:27:00,995
14, plus one in the chamber.

452
00:27:00,995 --> 00:27:02,746
It's a good fucking gun.
Durable.

453
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,582
It's brand-new.

454
00:27:06,584 --> 00:27:08,669
It's a BB gun.

455
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:10,087
Yeah. Cool.

456
00:27:10,171 --> 00:27:11,755
Here you go, dog.

457
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:13,090
<i>About time you got a cohete.</i>

458
00:27:13,174 --> 00:27:14,592
No. I don't want it.

459
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:16,927
Why the fuck not? I'll use it.

460
00:27:16,927 --> 00:27:18,929
That's a good reason. Sell it.

461
00:27:19,013 --> 00:27:21,015
How much you think
we can get for the gun?

462
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:23,767
Two bills, maybe three.
Costs six new.

463
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:25,936
We'll sell it
and split the greenery.

464
00:27:25,936 --> 00:27:26,937
You sure?

465
00:27:26,937 --> 00:27:28,606
It's cool, dude.

466
00:27:28,689 --> 00:27:30,191
50-50.

467
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:33,861
Good BB gun though.

468
00:27:33,944 --> 00:27:36,447
Shoot some birds and shit.

469
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:38,282
Hey, put that shit away.

470
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:39,783
Looks real as hell.

471
00:27:41,035 --> 00:27:42,119
Not a bad day's work.

472
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:56,634
Get down to business though.

473
00:27:56,717 --> 00:27:59,136
I know you didn't get any.

474
00:27:59,136 --> 00:28:00,638
So pay up, motherfucker.

475
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:06,644
Dick.

476
00:28:09,897 --> 00:28:13,484
Hello. This is a message
for Michael Alonzo.

477
00:28:13,484 --> 00:28:18,322
This is Bob Luell
at the Palm Glen Group.

478
00:28:18,322 --> 00:28:20,407
We have reviewed your resumé,

479
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:23,160
and would like
to make an appointment

480
00:28:23,244 --> 00:28:24,578
for later in the week.

481
00:28:24,662 --> 00:28:25,746
Please call me at your

482
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,581
earliest convenience.

483
00:28:27,665 --> 00:28:28,582
Thank you.

484
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:30,918
Huh? That's good.

485
00:28:30,918 --> 00:28:32,503
One more? This is fun.

486
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:34,672
Sounded a little gay,
but it was good.

487
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:37,842
No, no, no. no.
That's it, dude. That's it.

488
00:28:37,842 --> 00:28:40,010
I get too many callbacks,

489
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,262
Sylvia's going
to get suspicious.

490
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:42,930
Oh, Sylvia's going
to be kissing your ass.

491
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:44,348
Not if she
recognizes your voice.

492
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:46,350
Oh, she won't. Here, sir.

493
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:48,018
No, no, no, no, no.
I'm cool.

494
00:28:48,018 --> 00:28:49,520
- Come on.
- I'm cool.

495
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,022
I want to get home before the
little woman and sober up.

496
00:28:52,022 --> 00:28:54,024
Come on, bro. One brew.

497
00:28:54,108 --> 00:28:56,360
All right, but hey,

498
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:58,279
I got to look for a job
tomorrow for sure.

499
00:28:58,279 --> 00:28:59,530
Okay? I can't
be getting fucked up

500
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:00,614
behind Sylvia's back
when I'm supposed

501
00:29:00,698 --> 00:29:01,699
to be looking
for work, man.

502
00:29:01,782 --> 00:29:03,450
Not cool.
Tomorrow, for sure.

503
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,536
I got to find a job, too.

504
00:29:07,788 --> 00:29:10,624
(phone rings)

505
00:29:10,708 --> 00:29:12,293
Hello.

506
00:29:14,879 --> 00:29:17,131
Yes, sir.

507
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,218
Yes, sir. That is correct.

508
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:22,720
Six years.

509
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,972
Honorably discharged.

510
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:26,724
Yes, sir.

511
00:29:26,724 --> 00:29:28,559
I would love to.

512
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,645
Believe me, I would
welcome the opportunity.

513
00:29:33,564 --> 00:29:34,732
Tomorrow

514
00:29:34,732 --> 00:29:37,651
is not a problem.

515
00:29:37,735 --> 00:29:39,987
Thank you, sir.
You have a good day, too.

516
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:42,740
Good-bye, sir.

517
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,992
That was the man, huh?
You're all "Sir,

518
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:46,410
sir, sir."

519
00:29:46,494 --> 00:29:50,581
Yes! Fucking yes! Thank God!

520
00:29:54,752 --> 00:29:56,921
That was the man!
That was the Federal man!

521
00:29:56,921 --> 00:29:59,507
The Federal man!

522
00:29:59,507 --> 00:30:00,758
Department of
Homeland Security

523
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:02,676
wants me to come in
tomorrow to start testing!

524
00:30:02,676 --> 00:30:05,596
Oh, shit!

525
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:06,931
Fucking A, my brother!

526
00:30:06,931 --> 00:30:08,265
That shit is righteous,
motherfucker!

527
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:09,517
It's on, homie!

528
00:30:09,517 --> 00:30:11,185
Wow, man.
Tomorrow.

529
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:12,937
So what the fuck you
going to do now, dude?

530
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,522
I got to take a piss test.

531
00:30:14,605 --> 00:30:15,940
If I'm cool,
I'm in the house.

532
00:30:19,777 --> 00:30:22,446
Yeah! Oh!

533
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:25,950
Shit, dude,
do they piss test for weed?

534
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:28,619
Oh, shit!

535
00:30:31,372 --> 00:30:32,873
You fucked up, man.

536
00:30:32,957 --> 00:30:34,792
Oh, fuck.

537
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:38,212
I fucked up.

538
00:30:38,212 --> 00:30:40,798
Oh, fuck. I fucked up.

539
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:43,217
Fuck! Oh...

540
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:46,303
You know, one dope
molecule, and I'm done.

541
00:30:46,303 --> 00:30:48,806
And they will burn me

542
00:30:48,806 --> 00:30:51,392
with every law enforcement
outfit in the country.

543
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:52,643
Shit!

544
00:30:52,643 --> 00:30:53,978
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, dude.

545
00:30:53,978 --> 00:30:57,398
Look at me. Look at me.
Look at me. Look at me.

546
00:30:57,481 --> 00:30:59,316
Hey, there's a way out
of every fucking situation.

547
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:01,819
- Right? Relax, dude.
- Yeah, yeah.

548
00:31:01,902 --> 00:31:04,321
Yeah. I'm going to do
what I got to do, you know?

549
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:05,489
It's cool. Fuck, yeah.

550
00:31:05,489 --> 00:31:06,574
I'll pass that shit.

551
00:31:06,657 --> 00:31:07,992
Hell, yeah. Yeah.

552
00:31:08,075 --> 00:31:10,411
Of course
you will, dude!

553
00:31:10,411 --> 00:31:13,330
Later, loco.

554
00:31:13,414 --> 00:31:14,665
Don't fucking trip, dude.

555
00:31:14,665 --> 00:31:15,583
All right.

556
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:17,585
(sighs):
Shit.

557
00:31:23,924 --> 00:31:24,842
Eat.

558
00:31:24,925 --> 00:31:26,343
(knocking on door)

559
00:31:26,427 --> 00:31:27,928
Come in, dumb ass!

560
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,851
What's up, dog?

561
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:34,852
What up, dog...

562
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:37,688
Hey, Jim.
Want some coffee?

563
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:38,772
Sure.

564
00:31:38,856 --> 00:31:40,608
Want some eggs?
There's extra.

565
00:31:40,608 --> 00:31:42,860
Yes, ma'am. Please.

566
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:45,863
I, uh, heard
about the LAPD.

567
00:31:45,946 --> 00:31:47,781
Sorry about that.

568
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:49,700
I thought they
guaranteed you a job.

569
00:31:49,783 --> 00:31:51,285
Yea. Me, too.

570
00:31:51,285 --> 00:31:54,955
Well, maybe it
wasn't meant to be.

571
00:31:54,955 --> 00:31:57,708
You know, you being a cop.

572
00:31:59,543 --> 00:32:01,378
Tell her what's up, dude.

573
00:32:01,378 --> 00:32:02,713
Well, I applied

574
00:32:02,713 --> 00:32:05,799
to all the Federal
law enforcement agencies.

575
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:07,134
You know, ATF, Border Patrol,

576
00:32:07,218 --> 00:32:08,636
ICE, Homeland Security,
all of them.

577
00:32:08,636 --> 00:32:11,388
And Homeland Security's
interested in me.

578
00:32:11,472 --> 00:32:13,974
They want me to come in today
and start testing.

579
00:32:14,058 --> 00:32:16,477
Wow. That's great.
How sure is this?

580
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,229
Well, I got a urinalysis today.

581
00:32:18,312 --> 00:32:20,481
If I pass that, I'll be
a Special Agent candidate,

582
00:32:20,481 --> 00:32:22,483
and then I could
be out of here next month.

583
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:24,401
You haven't been
smoking out, have you?

584
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:28,155
Nah. Chilled on that shit
a while back.

585
00:32:28,155 --> 00:32:30,407
Good. Well, thanks for driving
Mike around yesterday.

586
00:32:30,407 --> 00:32:32,326
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah, bro.

587
00:32:32,326 --> 00:32:34,328
Three callbacks.

588
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:36,997
Damn! Good!

589
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:39,750
We dropped off
enough resumés. Whoo!

590
00:32:39,834 --> 00:32:41,252
Got more.

591
00:32:41,252 --> 00:32:42,253
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

592
00:32:42,336 --> 00:32:43,838
Well, you have
to keep trying

593
00:32:43,921 --> 00:32:45,422
until something happens.

594
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:46,924
<i>Finding a job is a job, right?</i>

595
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:48,259
Lunch money.

596
00:32:48,342 --> 00:32:49,510
Thank you.

597
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:50,845
And good
luck today.

598
00:32:50,845 --> 00:32:52,763
Thank you.

599
00:32:52,847 --> 00:32:54,265
- Love you.
- I love you, too.

600
00:32:54,265 --> 00:32:56,100
Good luck.

601
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,519
And, Jim, good luck
on your pee test.

602
00:32:58,602 --> 00:32:59,770
I hope you studied.

603
00:33:01,605 --> 00:33:05,192
I'm going to
cram for it.

604
00:33:05,276 --> 00:33:07,611
Man, that's freaky.

605
00:33:07,695 --> 00:33:09,697
She was in
a good mood.

606
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,198
Breakfast
and beer money?

607
00:33:11,198 --> 00:33:12,199
Yeah, dude.

608
00:33:12,283 --> 00:33:14,618
She heard the
messages last night.

609
00:33:14,618 --> 00:33:15,786
She got me a sixer.

610
00:33:15,786 --> 00:33:17,454
I slammed two last night.

611
00:33:17,538 --> 00:33:19,123
Out-fuckin'-standing!

612
00:33:19,206 --> 00:33:20,791
Now we know beer is just
a phone call away.

613
00:33:20,875 --> 00:33:22,042
Yeah.

614
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:24,795
Yeah. We talked shit out
last night, though.

615
00:33:24,795 --> 00:33:28,048
You know? Hey, all she wants
is for me to get a job.

616
00:33:28,132 --> 00:33:30,968
I shouldn't be playing her
like that.

617
00:33:32,553 --> 00:33:34,388
<i>Dude, you had a good job,</i>

618
00:33:34,388 --> 00:33:37,057
with that, uh, with
that Web design shit.

619
00:33:37,057 --> 00:33:38,642
<i>Had, dude. Had.</i>

620
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:40,895
All right? All that
shit's in India now.

621
00:33:40,895 --> 00:33:42,563
Want a cold one?
No, later.

622
00:33:42,646 --> 00:33:43,814
You got any vinegar?

623
00:33:43,898 --> 00:33:46,317
Vinegar? What for?

624
00:33:51,322 --> 00:33:53,324
(exhales):
Ah...

625
00:33:53,324 --> 00:33:55,326
(groans):
Oh...

626
00:33:55,326 --> 00:33:56,410
Damn, dude!

627
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:57,578
Ah...!

628
00:33:57,661 --> 00:33:58,746
(blabbers)

629
00:33:58,829 --> 00:34:00,331
- Man!
- That is fuckin' sick, man.

630
00:34:00,414 --> 00:34:02,333
What'd you do that for?

631
00:34:02,333 --> 00:34:03,834
- Shuts down the old kidneys.
- Ooh.

632
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:05,836
Come on, let's roll.

633
00:34:13,344 --> 00:34:15,346
Grab me that bag, dude.

634
00:34:21,852 --> 00:34:24,522
Little trick I learned
in the service.

635
00:34:27,691 --> 00:34:29,860
Aw, that's sick, dude.

636
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:32,530
You're gonna stick
a turkey baster in your dick?

637
00:34:33,614 --> 00:34:35,199
Quit looking, faggot.

638
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:38,035
You wish.

639
00:34:41,205 --> 00:34:43,707
(quiet grunt)

640
00:34:43,707 --> 00:34:44,959
(loud groaning)

641
00:34:44,959 --> 00:34:46,460
(groans):
Oh, man.

642
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,795
(yells in pain)
Fuckin'...

643
00:34:47,795 --> 00:34:49,380
shit, dude.

644
00:34:49,463 --> 00:34:50,464
Oh, fuckin' shit...

645
00:34:50,548 --> 00:34:52,132
- (pained grunting)
- Aw...

646
00:34:53,551 --> 00:34:55,219
Aw, motherfucker!

647
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:58,472
(gasps, groans)

648
00:34:58,472 --> 00:35:00,224
Whew!

649
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:01,725
Ah...

650
00:35:01,725 --> 00:35:03,978
(inhales)

651
00:35:04,061 --> 00:35:06,146
(groans)

652
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:08,148
That was...

653
00:35:08,148 --> 00:35:10,818
unpleasant.

654
00:35:15,573 --> 00:35:17,575
(quiet groan):
Man...

655
00:35:17,575 --> 00:35:19,243
(clears throat softly)

656
00:35:19,326 --> 00:35:21,662
Man, I want to get
this shit over with.

657
00:35:21,745 --> 00:35:23,998
You know, my teeth are floating.

658
00:35:24,081 --> 00:35:25,833
(Jim groans)

659
00:35:25,833 --> 00:35:27,668
Oh...

660
00:35:27,668 --> 00:35:30,254
You get those
in the military, dog?

661
00:35:30,254 --> 00:35:32,506
I was a Ranger.

662
00:35:32,506 --> 00:35:34,675
Your mom still suck
a mean dick, hmm?

663
00:35:34,758 --> 00:35:36,427
Gotcha! Shouldn't ignore people.

664
00:35:36,427 --> 00:35:38,012
Why don't you go
fuck yourself!

665
00:35:38,095 --> 00:35:39,180
Hey!

666
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,598
Let's play nice,

667
00:35:40,598 --> 00:35:42,183
boys.

668
00:35:42,266 --> 00:35:45,269
I have everyone's "Consent to
Urinalysis" form signed

669
00:35:45,269 --> 00:35:46,353
and dated, am I right?

670
00:35:46,437 --> 00:35:47,354
ALL:
Yes, sir.

671
00:35:47,438 --> 00:35:49,356
Good. I'm Agent Richards.

672
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,025
Jackets off.

673
00:35:51,108 --> 00:35:53,194
I will now administer
the easiest test

674
00:35:53,194 --> 00:35:55,196
Homeland Security
will ever give you,

675
00:35:55,279 --> 00:35:56,614
the whizz quiz.

676
00:35:56,614 --> 00:35:59,033
Roll up both sleeves
past the elbow.

677
00:36:00,284 --> 00:36:05,289
Remove all gloves, rings,
watches, bracelets,

678
00:36:05,289 --> 00:36:09,627
jewelry, Band-Aids
and bandages.

679
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:13,214
I want to see nothing
but bare hands and forearms.

680
00:36:13,214 --> 00:36:15,799
Wiggle your fingers.

681
00:36:15,883 --> 00:36:18,552
Let me see
both sides.

682
00:36:18,594 --> 00:36:20,387
Beautifully done.

683
00:36:20,429 --> 00:36:22,515
Again, gentlemen,
no talking.

684
00:36:22,515 --> 00:36:23,807
Detweiler, is it?

685
00:36:23,807 --> 00:36:25,726
You're with me.

686
00:36:27,728 --> 00:36:29,730
(blows sharply)

687
00:36:35,069 --> 00:36:37,321
(blows softly)

688
00:36:37,363 --> 00:36:38,989
(blows loudly)

689
00:36:39,073 --> 00:36:40,491
(whispers):
Fucker.

690
00:36:40,491 --> 00:36:43,494
(door opens, closes)

691
00:36:45,579 --> 00:36:47,665
RICHARDS:
Next!

692
00:36:51,502 --> 00:36:52,753
Name?

693
00:36:52,753 --> 00:36:54,922
Davis, Jim.

694
00:36:54,922 --> 00:36:56,590
Ah, the Ranger.

695
00:36:56,674 --> 00:36:58,008
Yes, sir.

696
00:36:58,092 --> 00:37:01,011
- You serve?
- 101st.

697
00:37:01,011 --> 00:37:03,514
- High speed.
- All right.

698
00:37:03,514 --> 00:37:05,432
Think you can fill that, son?

699
00:37:05,432 --> 00:37:08,143
I could fill
a goddamn trash can, sir.

700
00:37:08,185 --> 00:37:11,188
(laughs): You're full of piss
and vinegar, aren't you, Jim?

701
00:37:11,188 --> 00:37:13,357
Yes, sir.

702
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,861
##

703
00:37:16,944 --> 00:37:19,613
Hey, unload that shit before
you clown with it, okay?

704
00:37:19,697 --> 00:37:21,365
I don't want my head
blown off

705
00:37:21,407 --> 00:37:22,741
just when I'm getting
it straight.

706
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:26,954
Pop! What's it like

707
00:37:27,037 --> 00:37:28,455
to just straight-up
whack a motherfucker?

708
00:37:28,539 --> 00:37:31,584
What's it like?
I mean, what the fuck, you know?

709
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:34,128
It's like nothing.
What's it supposed to be like?

710
00:37:34,211 --> 00:37:35,504
You tell me.

711
00:37:35,546 --> 00:37:37,840
You were busting heads
for the military.

712
00:37:37,882 --> 00:37:40,384
I can't talk about
this shit, Mike.

713
00:37:44,054 --> 00:37:46,974
But I will tell you one
thing-- you point and shoot,

714
00:37:47,057 --> 00:37:49,810
pop, pop, move on, fuck 'em,
they shouldn't have been there,

715
00:37:49,852 --> 00:37:51,395
you move the fuck on.

716
00:37:51,395 --> 00:37:55,399
<i>You do not stop
and think about it.</i>

717
00:37:55,399 --> 00:37:57,651
- It's not a big deal.
- So if it's nothing,

718
00:37:57,735 --> 00:37:59,069
then what you getting
all mad for?

719
00:37:59,153 --> 00:38:00,279
I'm not getting mad.

720
00:38:00,279 --> 00:38:01,739
I just hate stupid
questions, Mike.

721
00:38:01,739 --> 00:38:03,908
You think you killed
a lot of Commies?

722
00:38:03,908 --> 00:38:05,993
- They weren't Commies, dumb ass.
- Then what were they?

723
00:38:06,076 --> 00:38:08,412
You know what they were--
they were fuckin' Hajjis,

724
00:38:08,412 --> 00:38:10,956
terrorists, the bad guys.

725
00:38:10,998 --> 00:38:14,001
Did you like it?
(quietly): Oh, shit.

726
00:38:14,084 --> 00:38:16,003
Did you dig it?

727
00:38:16,086 --> 00:38:18,422
You bust a nut?
(popping sound)

728
00:38:19,924 --> 00:38:22,259
Not fuckin' now, man.
Seriously.

729
00:38:23,469 --> 00:38:25,930
You're killing my buzz, dude.

730
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:28,432
Aw, kick back, stress case.

731
00:38:28,432 --> 00:38:30,768
Are we on a mission to
sell this piece or what?

732
00:38:30,851 --> 00:38:31,936
Hell, yeah.

733
00:38:32,019 --> 00:38:33,354
Let's sell this
fuckin' piece.

734
00:38:33,437 --> 00:38:35,981
Got to get some scratch,
you know what I'm saying?

735
00:38:35,981 --> 00:38:36,774
Pop! Pop! Pop!

736
00:38:38,943 --> 00:38:41,111
(dog barking in distance)

737
00:38:42,696 --> 00:38:46,033
(loud music playing over stereo)

738
00:38:46,116 --> 00:38:49,870
# Don't lay your funky trip
on me... #

739
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,622
Yo, Darrel!

740
00:38:51,622 --> 00:38:54,291
- Yo, yo, yo, Darrel!
- Wake the fuck up, Darrel!

741
00:38:54,375 --> 00:38:55,793
- (loud music continues)
- (banging on door)

742
00:38:55,876 --> 00:38:57,127
Darrel!

743
00:38:57,211 --> 00:38:59,421
Come on, come on, come on,
wake up and fuckin'

744
00:38:59,463 --> 00:39:01,048
shine!

745
00:39:01,131 --> 00:39:03,092
(loud music continues)

746
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:09,098
Y'all need to knock
this shit off right now.

747
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,560
- (Mike chuckling)
- Hey, what's up, bro?

748
00:39:12,643 --> 00:39:14,395
(both talking indistinctly)

749
00:39:14,395 --> 00:39:15,855
Come on in, motherfuckers.

750
00:39:15,896 --> 00:39:17,314
(mocking gibberish)
Yeah.

751
00:39:17,314 --> 00:39:19,149
Get your little
ass up in here.

752
00:39:19,149 --> 00:39:20,276
Shit!

753
00:39:20,276 --> 00:39:21,610
# Brother, please! #

754
00:39:21,652 --> 00:39:23,487
Oh, man...

755
00:39:23,487 --> 00:39:25,823
y'all scared
the fuck out of me, man.

756
00:39:25,906 --> 00:39:26,907
(chuckling)

757
00:39:26,991 --> 00:39:29,410
You motherfuckers
got ties on.

758
00:39:29,493 --> 00:39:31,328
I saw that city-lookin'
car pull up--

759
00:39:31,412 --> 00:39:33,497
I thought y'all was
some rollers or shit.

760
00:39:33,497 --> 00:39:35,499
(chuckles quietly)

761
00:39:35,583 --> 00:39:36,959
I just got out of County.

762
00:39:37,001 --> 00:39:40,337
- $9,600.
- No shit. When?

763
00:39:40,337 --> 00:39:42,173
Yesterday.

764
00:39:42,173 --> 00:39:43,841
MIKE: Damn. What'd
they put on you?

765
00:39:43,841 --> 00:39:44,800
Some bullshit.

766
00:39:44,842 --> 00:39:47,011
I saw some wrong-ass shit

767
00:39:47,011 --> 00:39:48,262
up in there, dude.

768
00:39:48,345 --> 00:39:50,431
I ain't ever going back
to that motherfucker.

769
00:39:50,514 --> 00:39:52,016
It scared you straight, huh?

770
00:39:52,016 --> 00:39:54,685
- Mm-hmm.
- Hey, you get booty-played?

771
00:39:54,685 --> 00:39:56,687
(laughing)

772
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:58,022
<i>Hell, no.</i>

773
00:39:58,105 --> 00:40:00,107
You over there tickling
your brown eye, dog?

774
00:40:00,191 --> 00:40:02,610
They-they put some jelly
on there, serve some syrup?

775
00:40:02,693 --> 00:40:04,612
- You toss the salad?
- Hey, you know, nigga,

776
00:40:04,695 --> 00:40:08,449
I kept my ass to the wall
and my mouth shut.

777
00:40:08,532 --> 00:40:09,700
Shoot.

778
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,911
I almost lost my job
over that shit.

779
00:40:11,911 --> 00:40:13,537
Fuckin' around in there.

780
00:40:16,707 --> 00:40:18,959
Oh, God...

781
00:40:19,043 --> 00:40:20,794
- You a cop?
- Nope.

782
00:40:20,878 --> 00:40:22,588
Rejected his ass.

783
00:40:22,588 --> 00:40:23,714
Fuck you.

784
00:40:23,797 --> 00:40:25,299
I'm getting
in the Feds' car.

785
00:40:25,382 --> 00:40:28,469
(laughs):
Damn...!

786
00:40:28,469 --> 00:40:30,804
That's what I'm talking about!

787
00:40:30,888 --> 00:40:32,723
Ah, you hear that?

788
00:40:32,765 --> 00:40:35,309
<i>This motherfucker
gonna be a Fed.</i>

789
00:40:35,351 --> 00:40:37,186
Yeah.

790
00:40:37,186 --> 00:40:39,396
You been wanting that shit, too.

791
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,357
It's my dream, dude.

792
00:40:41,398 --> 00:40:43,192
So, you gonna do
that shit right,

793
00:40:43,234 --> 00:40:46,237
or, you know, you gonna do
a little shit on the side?

794
00:40:46,237 --> 00:40:48,405
I'm gonna get
my own thing going.

795
00:40:48,405 --> 00:40:50,991
You know, I'll be flipping shit,
make a little money.

796
00:40:51,075 --> 00:40:53,410
- You know?
- (laughing)

797
00:40:53,494 --> 00:40:57,248
<i>This motherfucker
gonna have shit wired.</i>

798
00:40:57,248 --> 00:40:59,583
Scary, huh?

799
00:40:59,625 --> 00:41:00,918
(Jim clears throat)

800
00:41:01,001 --> 00:41:04,421
Check this shit out.

801
00:41:04,421 --> 00:41:05,756
Oh, hello!

802
00:41:05,756 --> 00:41:07,258
(chuckles):
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

803
00:41:07,258 --> 00:41:09,009
This is sweet!

804
00:41:09,009 --> 00:41:11,679
<i>We jacked some eses.
Got a BB gun, too.</i>

805
00:41:11,762 --> 00:41:14,014
- A BB gun?
- Yo.

806
00:41:14,098 --> 00:41:16,267
Goddamn!

807
00:41:16,267 --> 00:41:19,186
This is a nice little machine.

808
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:21,230
Three bills, it's yours.

809
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:23,190
I ain't got
three bills, dog.

810
00:41:23,274 --> 00:41:26,277
My lawyer cleaned me out.

811
00:41:26,277 --> 00:41:27,778
(sighs):
Man...

812
00:41:27,778 --> 00:41:31,157
I ain't got no ways
or means, homie.

813
00:41:32,449 --> 00:41:34,451
I need this shit, too.

814
00:41:35,452 --> 00:41:37,454
Bring the heat
to these motherfuckers

815
00:41:37,538 --> 00:41:39,373
trippin' around here.

816
00:41:40,457 --> 00:41:42,293
We need ends, dog.

817
00:41:42,376 --> 00:41:46,255
Who'll give us
three bills for it?

818
00:41:46,297 --> 00:41:48,090
Hey, uh, I know a cat.

819
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:50,634
Hangs out at, uh... La Licha

820
00:41:50,634 --> 00:41:51,760
on, uh, Santa Fe.

821
00:41:51,802 --> 00:41:53,554
Yeah, I know that place.

That shit could have been
over anything, you know?

Money, drugs, bitches,

and arms blown off

984
00:49:22,336 --> 00:49:24,755
by a booby-trapped motorcycle.

985
00:49:24,755 --> 00:49:28,008
Medic saved his ass
and he lived.

986
00:49:28,092 --> 00:49:31,929
He didn't want to, but he did.

987
00:49:31,929 --> 00:49:33,347
I got to face my woman.

988
00:49:33,347 --> 00:49:35,683
How in the fuck am I supposed
to play this shit off, huh?

989
00:49:35,683 --> 00:49:37,768
Man, you'll do it, player.

990
00:49:39,687 --> 00:49:42,773
(siren wails in distance)

991
00:49:46,277 --> 00:49:48,028
Hey, baby girl,
you cooking?

992
00:49:48,028 --> 00:49:49,446
Yeah. Where have you been?

993
00:49:49,446 --> 00:49:50,948
Oh, Jim's pad.

994
00:49:50,948 --> 00:49:52,283
You been drinking?

995
00:49:52,283 --> 00:49:53,951
Oh, you know,
I had a few brews.

996
00:49:53,951 --> 00:49:55,369
A few?
Yeah.

997
00:49:55,452 --> 00:49:56,620
You look wasted.

998
00:49:58,956 --> 00:49:59,957
(gasps)

999
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:01,041
Don't trip, girl.

1000
00:50:01,041 --> 00:50:02,293
I've been working
all day.

1001
00:50:02,293 --> 00:50:06,630
I've been looking
for work all day.

1002
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:09,633
I wish I could hang out and
get wasted like the old days.

1003
00:50:09,633 --> 00:50:11,468
You know what?

1004
00:50:11,468 --> 00:50:13,804
When I'm working,
you can lounge.

1005
00:50:13,804 --> 00:50:15,723
I'll fix this place up,

1006
00:50:15,723 --> 00:50:17,141
get you nice clothes
and stuff...

1007
00:50:17,141 --> 00:50:18,392
Mike, Mike, Mike.

1008
00:50:18,475 --> 00:50:20,978
It doesn't have anything
to do with money.

1009
00:50:20,978 --> 00:50:22,396
Come here.

1010
00:50:22,396 --> 00:50:25,816
Sit down. I want
to talk to you.

1011
00:50:25,816 --> 00:50:27,401
Hey, it's not
about stuff.

1012
00:50:27,401 --> 00:50:30,404
It's about you and me
needing an equal partner.

1013
00:50:30,488 --> 00:50:31,906
Right.

1014
00:50:31,906 --> 00:50:34,074
Hey, I know that you
supported me through college

1015
00:50:34,074 --> 00:50:35,576
and I'm gonna always

1016
00:50:35,576 --> 00:50:36,744
- owe you for that.
- Right.

1017
00:50:36,744 --> 00:50:37,995
Now everything's flipped

1018
00:50:38,078 --> 00:50:39,663
and I feel like I'm doing
everything alone.

1019
00:50:39,663 --> 00:50:43,751
You know, sometimes
I feel like you're my kid.

1020
00:50:43,751 --> 00:50:45,753
I mean, you sneak
around like one.

1021
00:50:45,836 --> 00:50:47,004
Oh-ho!

1022
00:50:47,004 --> 00:50:50,090
Look... Wow, dude.

1023
00:50:50,174 --> 00:50:52,426
I'm sorry.

1024
00:50:52,426 --> 00:50:53,427
Be cool, baby girl,

1025
00:50:53,511 --> 00:50:54,929
I'm on a mission
to get my shit together.

1026
00:50:54,929 --> 00:50:57,515
I applied at this commercial
realty company in Studio City,

1027
00:50:57,598 --> 00:50:59,850
and this black guy,
he was the office manager

1028
00:50:59,850 --> 00:51:01,101
and he's fuckin' hella cool,

1029
00:51:01,101 --> 00:51:02,937
you know? We're talkin'
and all that shit.

1030
00:51:02,937 --> 00:51:05,189
You know? We're just kickin' it
and all that.

1031
00:51:05,272 --> 00:51:07,691
Did you, did you
check the messages?

1032
00:51:09,527 --> 00:51:12,029
Four messages.

1033
00:51:12,112 --> 00:51:13,697
DARRELL:
Mr. Alonzo, I'm calling

1034
00:51:13,781 --> 00:51:16,367
from Sunhouse Properties
to schedule an interview.

1035
00:51:16,450 --> 00:51:18,953
Honey, this is great!

1036
00:51:18,953 --> 00:51:21,872
Mm, mm...
Oh! Oh...

1037
00:51:21,872 --> 00:51:23,874
You better call him
first thing in the morning.

1038
00:51:23,874 --> 00:51:25,459
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1039
00:51:25,459 --> 00:51:28,879
MIKE:
Oh, damn, dog,
that shit was good, dude.

1040
00:51:28,879 --> 00:51:31,382
Damn, they should give you
a fuckin' Oscar for that shit.

1041
00:51:31,465 --> 00:51:33,968
(machine beeps)

1042
00:51:42,309 --> 00:51:44,061
You just stood there

1043
00:51:44,061 --> 00:51:48,065
and you fed me a line of
bullshit like it was nothing.

1044
00:51:48,149 --> 00:51:51,902
You should be
the lawyer.

1045
00:51:51,986 --> 00:51:54,488
How could you just do that?

1046
00:51:54,572 --> 00:51:58,242
How could you look me in the eye
and lie to me like that?

1047
00:51:58,242 --> 00:51:59,326
I'm sorry.

1048
00:51:59,326 --> 00:52:01,912
I'd rather you hit me.

1049
00:52:03,414 --> 00:52:05,249
I'm your clown.

1050
00:52:05,332 --> 00:52:06,834
I'm your fucking clown.

1051
00:52:06,917 --> 00:52:10,421
And you and Jim
are laughing at me?

1052
00:52:10,421 --> 00:52:12,423
No, it's not...

1053
00:52:12,506 --> 00:52:16,760
No, no, no, you are so utterly,
irrevocably busted!

1054
00:52:20,431 --> 00:52:22,850
Why don't you just go play
with your little butt buddy?

1055
00:52:22,850 --> 00:52:24,852
Go cook up more lies.

1056
00:52:24,852 --> 00:52:26,854
You know, I bet
you're doing lines again.

1057
00:52:26,854 --> 00:52:29,523
Dude, how could you say
that shit?

1058
00:52:29,607 --> 00:52:30,774
I'm not fuckin'
doing lines again.

1059
00:52:30,858 --> 00:52:32,359
Yeah, right, right.

1060
00:52:32,443 --> 00:52:34,028
I'm not fuckin'
doing lines again!

1061
00:52:34,111 --> 00:52:36,614
Right now your word
is less than shit.

1062
00:52:36,614 --> 00:52:38,699
Maybe you should go.

1063
00:52:38,699 --> 00:52:42,620
Just fuckin' go.

1064
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:46,790
Just fuckin'... just go, right?

1065
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:48,375
Fuck it.
I'll fuckin' go!

1066
00:52:48,459 --> 00:52:49,543
Please, go. Go!

1067
00:52:49,543 --> 00:52:51,462
Fuck it then!
I'll fuckin' go!

1068
00:52:51,545 --> 00:52:53,130
Then go, Mike!

1069
00:52:53,214 --> 00:52:54,298
I'm serious!
I'll fuckin' go

1070
00:52:54,381 --> 00:52:55,549
except I won't fuckin'
come back!

1071
00:52:55,633 --> 00:52:56,800
You want me to fuckin' go?!

1072
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:57,801
Fuckin' go, Mike!

1073
00:52:57,885 --> 00:52:59,136
I'll fuckin' go then!

1074
00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:00,137
I'll fuckin' go!

1075
00:53:00,221 --> 00:53:03,140
Get the fuck outta here!

1076
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:05,476
(phone rings)

1077
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:12,483
Hello?

1078
00:53:12,566 --> 00:53:16,237
Speaking.

1079
00:53:16,237 --> 00:53:20,491
Of course, sir. Absolutely.

1080
00:53:20,491 --> 00:53:23,577
Thank you very much,
Agent Richards.

1081
00:53:23,661 --> 00:53:25,663
Thank you, sir.

1082
00:53:30,835 --> 00:53:31,836
Who was that?

1083
00:53:31,919 --> 00:53:33,254
That was the feds,
my friend.

1084
00:53:33,337 --> 00:53:36,924
I've been informed that I passed
my urinalysis

1085
00:53:37,007 --> 00:53:39,426
and they would like me
to go in this morning

1086
00:53:39,426 --> 00:53:42,680
to start formal testing.

1087
00:53:42,763 --> 00:53:44,181
Fuck yeah, dude.

1088
00:53:44,265 --> 00:53:45,349
I'll be there all day,

1089
00:53:45,349 --> 00:53:48,435
so take my ride,
get your ass a job.

1090
00:53:48,519 --> 00:53:49,520
Let's go.

1091
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:50,855
Oh, shit!

1092
00:53:50,855 --> 00:53:54,525
Come on. Get your
parasitic ass in gear.

1093
00:53:54,608 --> 00:53:58,612
(groans)

1094
00:53:58,612 --> 00:54:02,533
I had some twisted-ass dreams
about that dude being killed.

1095
00:54:02,616 --> 00:54:04,535
I slept like a baby.

1096
00:54:04,618 --> 00:54:08,038
I heard screaming.

1097
00:54:08,038 --> 00:54:09,623
What kind of tests?

1098
00:54:09,623 --> 00:54:12,459
Psychological tests.

1099
00:54:12,459 --> 00:54:15,713
Geez, you're
a freakin' psycho, dude.

1100
00:54:15,796 --> 00:54:17,214
Don't answer that shit
honestly.

1101
00:54:17,214 --> 00:54:19,717
Hell no.

1102
00:54:19,717 --> 00:54:23,053
They use the Minnesota
Multiphasic Inventory.

1103
00:54:23,137 --> 00:54:27,224
It's like 600 questions,
cross-referenced

1104
00:54:27,308 --> 00:54:29,310
to detect deception.

1105
00:54:29,310 --> 00:54:30,811
They ask the same shit

1106
00:54:30,895 --> 00:54:32,813
six different ways.
It's lame.

1107
00:54:32,897 --> 00:54:34,732
You'll ace it.

1108
00:54:34,732 --> 00:54:38,319
Dude, I'm gonna pull it off.

1109
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:41,906
All I needed was a shot.

1110
00:54:41,989 --> 00:54:43,741
Gotta play the system.

1111
00:54:43,741 --> 00:54:47,077
Like a piano.

1112
00:54:56,003 --> 00:54:57,588
You done
with that crap, son?

1113
00:54:57,671 --> 00:54:58,923
Yes, sir.

1114
00:54:58,923 --> 00:55:01,592
Let's grab some coffee
while these guys finish up.

1115
00:55:01,592 --> 00:55:03,677
Bring that with you.

1116
00:55:04,762 --> 00:55:06,680
(whispers):
I see dumb people.

1117
00:55:09,850 --> 00:55:12,102
We reviewed
your LAPD package.

1118
00:55:12,102 --> 00:55:14,688
Since they ran your background,
physical and psych,

1119
00:55:14,688 --> 00:55:16,774
we're going with
their paper.

1120
00:55:16,774 --> 00:55:18,359
- Navy sucks.
- Army swallows.

1121
00:55:18,442 --> 00:55:20,277
Took a little work to
pry your jacket loose

1122
00:55:20,361 --> 00:55:21,779
from their people.

1123
00:55:21,779 --> 00:55:24,365
They don't much like us poaching
from their applicant pool.

1124
00:55:24,448 --> 00:55:25,950
Move it, dirt bag.

1125
00:55:27,451 --> 00:55:28,953
Why'd they drop me?

1126
00:55:28,953 --> 00:55:31,455
Someone here make a call?

1127
00:55:31,455 --> 00:55:32,873
Nope.

1128
00:55:32,957 --> 00:55:34,208
They dropped you
on psych, Jim.

1129
00:55:35,626 --> 00:55:37,711
You blew
their profiles.

1130
00:55:37,795 --> 00:55:40,464
We're all a little
goofy here.

1131
00:55:40,464 --> 00:55:43,133
You'd rather be with us,
wouldn't you?

1132
00:55:43,217 --> 00:55:44,802
Absolutely, sir.

1133
00:55:44,802 --> 00:55:47,137
Good answer.

1134
00:55:47,137 --> 00:55:48,639
Have a seat.

1135
00:55:49,890 --> 00:55:51,892
Said you were bilingual
on your app.

1136
00:55:51,976 --> 00:55:53,561
They want to test your Spanish.

1137
00:55:53,644 --> 00:55:55,980
We can get that going
if you got time.

1138
00:55:56,063 --> 00:55:57,815
Yes. Sure.

1139
00:55:57,898 --> 00:55:59,400
Who's "they"?

1140
00:55:59,483 --> 00:56:00,985
Your fans upstairs.

1141
00:56:01,068 --> 00:56:02,903
Fans upstairs? Who?

1142
00:56:02,987 --> 00:56:05,489
This is some shit
above my pay grade,

1143
00:56:05,573 --> 00:56:09,076
but some very important people
have an eye on you, Jim.

1144
00:56:13,414 --> 00:56:14,999
RECEPTIONIST:
Westside Realty Management.

1145
00:56:15,082 --> 00:56:16,750
How may I direct your call?

1146
00:56:16,834 --> 00:56:17,835
(distant phone ringing)

1147
00:56:17,835 --> 00:56:19,003
Please hold.

1148
00:56:19,086 --> 00:56:22,339
Okay, Mike...

1149
00:56:22,339 --> 00:56:23,841
Alonzo?

1150
00:56:23,841 --> 00:56:25,259
Oh, shit. Joe?!

1151
00:56:25,342 --> 00:56:26,677
Damn...!
What's up, dog?

1152
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,762
- Mikey, look at you.
- What are you doing here, dude?

1153
00:56:28,846 --> 00:56:30,764
Mikey, man, check you out.

1154
00:56:30,764 --> 00:56:32,016
What the fuck you doing here?

1155
00:56:32,099 --> 00:56:33,434
Fucking grew up. I work here.

1156
00:56:33,517 --> 00:56:35,019
- Get out of here.
- Yeah.

1157
00:56:35,102 --> 00:56:36,770
Dude, you got to come on up.

1158
00:56:36,854 --> 00:56:38,022
Yeah, I'll show you
the office.

1159
00:56:38,105 --> 00:56:39,523
Fuck, you're gonna trip, man,

1160
00:56:39,523 --> 00:56:40,941
I can see the ocean
and everything.

1161
00:56:40,941 --> 00:56:43,360
Check you out, fucking
ocean view and all that.

1162
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:45,362
You're wearing a suit now.

1163
00:56:45,362 --> 00:56:46,947
- Got your hair cut.
- Hey, watch out, baby.

1164
00:56:47,031 --> 00:56:48,115
Yeah. Tag no more, huh?

1165
00:56:48,199 --> 00:56:49,533
No, man.

1166
00:56:49,617 --> 00:56:51,035
Dude, what's up with
your brother, Pedro?

1167
00:56:51,035 --> 00:56:53,120
Oh, man, he's in Iraq.
He's in a forward unit.

1168
00:56:53,204 --> 00:56:55,039
Get the fuck out of here. Yeah.

1169
00:56:55,122 --> 00:56:57,291
(muttering):
Fuckin' Mexicans.

1170
00:56:59,293 --> 00:57:00,211
Bye, sweetie.

1171
00:57:03,797 --> 00:57:05,966
Thank you, sir.
I need me some of this, man.

1172
00:57:06,050 --> 00:57:07,384
I've been taking piss all day.

1173
00:57:07,384 --> 00:57:08,385
Dude!

1174
00:57:08,385 --> 00:57:09,220
What?

1175
00:57:09,303 --> 00:57:10,221
You're not going to

1176
00:57:10,304 --> 00:57:11,388
- fucking believe this.
- What?

1177
00:57:11,472 --> 00:57:13,557
- I had an interview today.
- Yeah?

1178
00:57:13,641 --> 00:57:15,059
- Remember Crazy Joe?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1179
00:57:15,142 --> 00:57:16,977
Dude stomped that guy's
face in at Taco Land

1180
00:57:17,061 --> 00:57:18,979
for grabbing his chick's ass.

1181
00:57:19,063 --> 00:57:20,564
Homeboy got his shit
together, man.

1182
00:57:20,564 --> 00:57:21,649
Went to UCLA.

1183
00:57:21,649 --> 00:57:23,901
Works at this office
up in Century City.

1184
00:57:23,901 --> 00:57:25,319
I got the hookup, dog.

1185
00:57:25,319 --> 00:57:27,488
- 12 an hour.
- Hoo-hoo!

1186
00:57:27,488 --> 00:57:29,156
- That's a lot of lettuce.
- That's right.

1187
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:30,825
And in three months,
I get benefits.

1188
00:57:30,908 --> 00:57:31,909
Damn! Benefits?

1189
00:57:31,909 --> 00:57:33,661
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Shit!

1190
00:57:33,661 --> 00:57:34,829
Yeah!

1191
00:57:34,912 --> 00:57:36,497
It's not for sure yet,
though, dude.

1192
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:38,165
I still got to
meet the owner, right.

1193
00:57:38,249 --> 00:57:39,917
But he says I'm straight.

1194
00:57:39,917 --> 00:57:41,252
It's all good, you know.

1195
00:57:41,335 --> 00:57:43,254
You're in.
Dude...

1196
00:57:43,254 --> 00:57:44,755
I'm in.
Oh, shit.

1197
00:57:44,755 --> 00:57:46,257
Yeah...
What happened?

1198
00:57:46,257 --> 00:57:47,842
They want my ass, man.
Going back tomorrow

1199
00:57:47,925 --> 00:57:49,260
for a polygraph test.

1200
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:51,512
If I pass that, they'll
send me to Georgia next week.

1201
00:57:51,512 --> 00:57:53,597
Oh...! Damn!
It's like that?!

1202
00:57:53,597 --> 00:57:54,932
What's up, lawman?

1203
00:57:54,932 --> 00:57:56,267
Whoo-hoo!

1204
00:57:56,267 --> 00:57:57,935
How you gonna pass
a lie detector test,

1205
00:57:57,935 --> 00:57:59,603
- you lying motherfucker?
- Aw, easy, man.

1206
00:57:59,603 --> 00:58:02,439
After every question,
you just fucking squeeze

1207
00:58:02,439 --> 00:58:04,108
like you're taking
a dump, you know, man.

1208
00:58:04,108 --> 00:58:06,193
- It throws the machine off. Ooh!
- Oh, dog.

1209
00:58:06,277 --> 00:58:07,945
You're gonna shit your
pants like that, bro.

1210
00:58:08,028 --> 00:58:09,113
Fuck, I think I just did.

1211
00:58:09,196 --> 00:58:10,781
All right, Jim,

1212
00:58:10,865 --> 00:58:12,700
I'm going to ask you
some control questions

1213
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:14,952
before we get
to the good stuff.

1214
00:58:15,035 --> 00:58:17,454
They can be answered
just "yes" or "no."

1215
00:58:17,538 --> 00:58:20,708
Just relax and
respond naturally.

1216
00:58:20,708 --> 00:58:21,792
(mouse clicks)

1217
00:58:21,792 --> 00:58:22,877
Are you ready?

1218
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:23,878
Yes, sir.

1219
00:58:23,961 --> 00:58:26,297
You can just answer
"yes" or "no."

1220
00:58:27,381 --> 00:58:28,716
(mouse clicks)

1221
00:58:28,799 --> 00:58:31,719
"Is your name
Jim Luther Davis?"

1222
00:58:31,802 --> 00:58:33,470
Yes.

1223
00:58:33,470 --> 00:58:36,056
"Do you live in Los Angeles?"

1224
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:38,642
Yes.

1225
00:58:38,642 --> 00:58:41,562
"Are you 26 years old?"

1226
00:58:41,562 --> 00:58:42,646
Yes.

1227
00:58:44,148 --> 00:58:45,816
"Are you married?"

1228
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:47,651
No.

1229
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:51,405
(mouse clicks)

1230
00:58:51,489 --> 00:58:52,907
"Are you wearing shoes?"

1231
00:58:52,990 --> 00:58:56,410
Yes.

1232
00:58:56,410 --> 00:58:59,497
"Have you ever smoked
marijuana?"

1233
00:58:59,497 --> 00:59:03,834
Yes.

1234
00:59:03,834 --> 00:59:06,837
"Aside from the occasion you
mentioned in your application?"

1235
00:59:06,837 --> 00:59:08,672
No.

1236
00:59:12,009 --> 00:59:14,678
Jim, knock it off.

1237
00:59:16,597 --> 00:59:17,848
What, sir?

1238
00:59:17,932 --> 00:59:19,934
Son, I've been doing
polygraph examinations

1239
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:23,187
since you were swimming
in your daddy's balls.

1240
00:59:23,270 --> 00:59:25,689
So I know all the tricks.

1241
00:59:25,773 --> 00:59:27,358
You've either got a tack
in your shoe

1242
00:59:27,358 --> 00:59:29,360
or you're clinching
your butt.

1243
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:32,196
I've got spikes
all over this thing.

1244
00:59:32,196 --> 00:59:35,366
If you do it again,

1245
00:59:35,449 --> 00:59:37,701
I'm going to void this test

1246
00:59:37,701 --> 00:59:39,787
and report that you
were uncooperative.

1247
00:59:39,787 --> 00:59:41,121
Do you understand?

1248
00:59:41,205 --> 00:59:42,957
Yes, sir.

1249
00:59:45,876 --> 00:59:47,711
Walk with me.

1250
00:59:49,797 --> 00:59:51,131
We've got a problem, Jim.

1251
00:59:51,131 --> 00:59:52,550
With what?

1252
00:59:52,550 --> 00:59:54,134
With your candor.

1253
00:59:54,134 --> 00:59:55,135
(knocking on door)

1254
00:59:55,219 --> 00:59:57,304
Come in.

1255
00:59:57,304 --> 00:59:58,389
He's here, sir.

1256
00:59:58,472 --> 01:00:00,140
Bring him in.

1257
01:00:02,059 --> 01:00:04,311
Jim, this is Mr. Hollenbeck,
our regional director.

1258
01:00:04,395 --> 01:00:05,312
Pleased to meet you, sir.

1259
01:00:05,396 --> 01:00:06,897
Have a seat.

1260
01:00:06,981 --> 01:00:08,482
Mr. Gillespie.

1261
01:00:08,566 --> 01:00:10,901
Pleased to meet you, sir.

1262
01:00:13,237 --> 01:00:15,573
Jim, uh...

1263
01:00:15,573 --> 01:00:16,824
you're an exemplary candidate

1264
01:00:16,907 --> 01:00:19,243
with valuable
operational experience.

1265
01:00:19,243 --> 01:00:22,913
You've cleared the psych
and physical hurdles.

1266
01:00:22,913 --> 01:00:25,666
Your credit's good,
you've kept your nose clean,

1267
01:00:25,666 --> 01:00:27,168
you've got the Spanish.

1268
01:00:27,168 --> 01:00:28,502
You clearance is still valid.

1269
01:00:28,502 --> 01:00:29,920
Everybody we talked to
for background

1270
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:32,840
had only great things
to say about you.

1271
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:34,925
And then you scored a
negative-five on the polygraph.

1272
01:00:35,009 --> 01:00:39,263
That's indicative
of deception.

1273
01:00:39,263 --> 01:00:40,848
We were wondering why

1274
01:00:40,931 --> 01:00:43,684
until we got the results
of urinalysis.

1275
01:00:43,684 --> 01:00:47,438
We detected THC metabolites
in the urine, Jim.

1276
01:00:49,273 --> 01:00:52,276
Levels were just below
the positive threshold,

1277
01:00:52,359 --> 01:00:54,945
but there was a presence.

1278
01:00:54,945 --> 01:00:57,031
Do you have a drug
problem, Mr. Davis?

1279
01:00:57,114 --> 01:00:58,616
I don't have a
drug problem, sir.

1280
01:01:00,451 --> 01:01:02,953
I made a very
stupid mistake.

1281
01:01:03,037 --> 01:01:04,371
Would you care to tell us
the circumstances

1282
01:01:04,371 --> 01:01:05,539
of your stupid mistake?

1283
01:01:05,539 --> 01:01:07,541
I was at a party...

1284
01:01:07,625 --> 01:01:10,711
and someone offered me a joint.

1285
01:01:10,711 --> 01:01:14,465
I was pretty angry
about not getting into

1286
01:01:14,548 --> 01:01:18,469
the LAPD, so I was feeling
rebellious and, uh...

1287
01:01:21,472 --> 01:01:24,141
...I inhaled.

1288
01:01:24,225 --> 01:01:26,811
Someone considering a career
in law enforcement

1289
01:01:26,894 --> 01:01:28,395
would be well advised
to exercise

1290
01:01:28,479 --> 01:01:30,064
a little more discipline.

1291
01:01:30,064 --> 01:01:31,982
Yes, sir.

1292
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:36,320
I'm on the fence, Doug.

1293
01:01:36,403 --> 01:01:37,905
It's your call.

1294
01:01:37,905 --> 01:01:40,241
Mr. Davis, I'm in charge
of several programs.

1295
01:01:40,241 --> 01:01:42,243
Yes, sir?

1296
01:01:42,243 --> 01:01:45,162
Had a nice chat with your
old commanding officer.

1297
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:53,587
(speaks Korean)

1298
01:01:53,671 --> 01:01:55,422
Good.

1299
01:01:55,422 --> 01:01:56,757
Recognize these guys?

1300
01:02:00,344 --> 01:02:02,429
Huh?
Yeah,

1301
01:02:02,429 --> 01:02:03,430
they're your buddies.

1302
01:02:03,514 --> 01:02:05,015
Your old Hajji buddies.

1303
01:02:05,099 --> 01:02:07,101
You should work in a deli
how you sliced these guys up.

1304
01:02:07,184 --> 01:02:08,185
RICHARDS:
Jesus Christ.

1305
01:02:08,269 --> 01:02:09,687
Oh, I'm sorry.

1306
01:02:09,770 --> 01:02:12,189
Did I ruin your lunch?

1307
01:02:12,273 --> 01:02:14,024
You went through
those sons of bitches

1308
01:02:14,108 --> 01:02:16,110
like butter.

1309
01:02:16,193 --> 01:02:17,695
I took my objective

1310
01:02:17,778 --> 01:02:19,280
and did what was necessary

1311
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:22,283
to obtain information
vital to national security

1312
01:02:22,366 --> 01:02:24,451
that saved
American lives.

1313
01:02:24,535 --> 01:02:26,370
Whacked them all,
huh, Jim?

1314
01:02:26,370 --> 01:02:28,622
My C.O. told me not to leave
anything breathing.

1315
01:02:28,706 --> 01:02:30,541
- I do what I'm told.
- Relax, son.

1316
01:02:30,541 --> 01:02:34,378
You were getting paid
to fuck people up.

1317
01:02:34,378 --> 01:02:36,046
You know we're beefing up
our anti-narcotics programs

1318
01:02:36,046 --> 01:02:38,549
in Latin America.

1319
01:02:38,632 --> 01:02:39,717
Yes, sir.

1320
01:02:39,717 --> 01:02:42,553
I had heard some things
on the grapevine.

1321
01:02:42,553 --> 01:02:44,221
I want you on my team.

1322
01:02:44,221 --> 01:02:46,056
I need someone who
can get things done

1323
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:47,892
on my task force
in Colombia.

1324
01:02:47,892 --> 01:02:50,311
Sir...

1325
01:02:50,311 --> 01:02:52,980
I listed Los Angeles and
San Diego on my dream sheet.

1326
01:02:53,063 --> 01:02:54,815
No slots in southern California?

1327
01:02:54,815 --> 01:02:56,484
No, Jim.

1328
01:02:56,484 --> 01:02:57,485
I got Colombia.

1329
01:02:57,568 --> 01:02:59,403
That's what
I have for you.

1330
01:02:59,403 --> 01:03:01,405
If it's not
what you want,

1331
01:03:01,405 --> 01:03:02,406
thank you for your time.

1332
01:03:02,490 --> 01:03:04,825
You can hit the door.

1333
01:03:06,410 --> 01:03:09,497
What exactly would I be doing?

1334
01:03:09,580 --> 01:03:12,082
Running and gunning
in the jungle?

1335
01:03:12,166 --> 01:03:14,251
Mr. Davis,
this is the deal.

1336
01:03:14,251 --> 01:03:16,253
You'll be riding shotgun
with the locals

1337
01:03:16,253 --> 01:03:18,506
as interpreter-advisor
on sharp end operations.

1338
01:03:18,589 --> 01:03:20,007
You'll be in some
very hot areas.

1339
01:03:20,007 --> 01:03:21,842
How hot?

1340
01:03:21,842 --> 01:03:23,344
We talking trigger time?

1341
01:03:23,344 --> 01:03:24,678
Sure, if you want.

1342
01:03:24,678 --> 01:03:27,598
Well, who exactly
would I be working for?

1343
01:03:27,598 --> 01:03:29,767
The U.S. government, Jim.

1344
01:03:29,850 --> 01:03:32,603
I want you in Glynco,
Georgia next week.

1345
01:03:32,603 --> 01:03:34,772
You make it through
in one piece,

1346
01:03:34,855 --> 01:03:38,359
you'll be working Colombia's
finest by the summer.

1347
01:03:38,359 --> 01:03:40,277
It's just that...

1348
01:03:40,277 --> 01:03:42,863
I'm supposed to get
married, sir.

1349
01:03:42,947 --> 01:03:44,949
Maybe now is not the time
to start a family.

1350
01:03:44,949 --> 01:03:46,617
We've been together a long time.

1351
01:03:46,700 --> 01:03:49,036
I'm serious about marrying her.

1352
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:53,958
Foreign bride could jeopardize
your security clearance.

1353
01:03:54,041 --> 01:03:58,796
Jim, don't shack up
with some Mexican.

1354
01:03:58,796 --> 01:04:02,216
Colombian broads are
smoking hot and knee deep.

1355
01:04:02,216 --> 01:04:04,468
You get a per diem
and a driver.

1356
01:04:04,552 --> 01:04:06,637
You'll live like
a fucking king down there.

1357
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:07,721
Yes, sir, I understand.

1358
01:04:07,721 --> 01:04:08,806
You take some time,

1359
01:04:08,806 --> 01:04:10,224
think about what
you want to do.

1360
01:04:10,307 --> 01:04:11,308
This is a serious
commitment.

1361
01:04:15,479 --> 01:04:18,899
I want the opportunity, sir.

1362
01:04:18,983 --> 01:04:20,901
I want on board.

1363
01:04:25,823 --> 01:04:27,324
Welcome aboard.

1364
01:04:27,324 --> 01:04:28,826
I'm taking a big
chance on you.

1365
01:04:28,909 --> 01:04:29,910
Thank you, sir.

1366
01:04:29,994 --> 01:04:31,579
This is the career
I've dreamed of.

1367
01:04:31,662 --> 01:04:32,997
These are your orders,

1368
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:34,498
orientation material
and travel money.

1369
01:04:34,582 --> 01:04:38,502
Report to FLETC before the end
of working hours Wednesday.

1370
01:04:38,502 --> 01:04:40,671
Thank you, sir.

1371
01:04:40,754 --> 01:04:41,839
God.

1372
01:04:59,690 --> 01:05:02,026
Sorry, dog.

1373
01:05:07,865 --> 01:05:09,950
I got the job.

1374
01:05:11,118 --> 01:05:12,953
Oh, shit.

1375
01:05:13,037 --> 01:05:15,539
Yeah?

1376
01:05:15,623 --> 01:05:17,708
Me, too.

1377
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:22,296
- When do you start?
- Monday.

1378
01:05:22,379 --> 01:05:23,714
When do you start?

1379
01:05:23,714 --> 01:05:24,965
Wednesday.

1380
01:05:24,965 --> 01:05:28,385
Big Jim, back on
the man's payroll.

1381
01:05:28,469 --> 01:05:31,222
Got the W-2

1382
01:05:31,222 --> 01:05:34,475
and the employee handbook
as proof of employment.

1383
01:05:34,558 --> 01:05:37,561
I will be back in the
arms of my woman tonight.

1384
01:05:37,645 --> 01:05:40,815
Good.

1385
01:05:40,815 --> 01:05:43,234
Hey, we got to celebrate
this shit.

1386
01:05:44,235 --> 01:05:45,820
<i>Salud.</i>

1387
01:05:49,490 --> 01:05:50,658
Oh, shit.

1388
01:05:54,662 --> 01:05:56,413
Fuzz.

1389
01:05:56,497 --> 01:05:58,332
They're on my ass, dog.

1390
01:05:58,332 --> 01:06:01,168
<i>And my license is suspended.</i>

1391
01:06:01,168 --> 01:06:03,003
Yeah, maybe he's
after someone else.

1392
01:06:03,003 --> 01:06:05,005
(siren honks)

1393
01:06:05,089 --> 01:06:07,258
Shit. Fucking shit, man.

1394
01:06:07,341 --> 01:06:09,510
He's pointing right at me.

1395
01:06:09,510 --> 01:06:11,595
And we got the open beers.

1396
01:06:11,595 --> 01:06:14,515
Fuck the beers, the guns.

1397
01:06:14,598 --> 01:06:16,433
Shoot the fucker.

1398
01:06:16,433 --> 01:06:18,269
Car's in my name. We're fucked.

1399
01:06:18,269 --> 01:06:21,272
(siren blaring)

1400
01:06:21,272 --> 01:06:25,025
Shit. Right when shit
was starting to go good, dude,

1401
01:06:25,109 --> 01:06:26,110
I'm going to jail.

1402
01:06:26,193 --> 01:06:27,444
Damn it, I'm going to jail.

1403
01:06:29,697 --> 01:06:31,282
I can dump these guys.

1404
01:06:32,449 --> 01:06:34,535
Rip the video
from their trunk.

1405
01:06:40,207 --> 01:06:41,375
Let's see them hands.

1406
01:06:41,458 --> 01:06:42,459
Let's see your hands

1407
01:06:42,459 --> 01:06:44,378
on the fucking dash!

1408
01:06:44,378 --> 01:06:47,381
Grab the sky or I'll blow
your fucking heads off.

1409
01:06:47,464 --> 01:06:49,633
Blink and die, scumbags.

1410
01:06:53,721 --> 01:06:55,389
Oh.

1411
01:06:55,473 --> 01:06:57,308
Look who it is, dude.

1412
01:06:57,391 --> 01:06:58,893
It's all right,
I know these guys.

1413
01:06:58,976 --> 01:07:00,978
You fucking asshole.

1414
01:07:01,061 --> 01:07:02,980
You're such a prick.
You scared the fuck out of me.

1415
01:07:03,063 --> 01:07:06,317
What's up, homie?

1416
01:07:06,317 --> 01:07:08,986
- What's up, fool?
- What's up, man.

1417
01:07:09,069 --> 01:07:11,572
I almost shot you, jerk.

1418
01:07:11,572 --> 01:07:13,073
That shit wasn't fucking
funny, Leo.

1419
01:07:13,157 --> 01:07:14,158
Yeah, it was hilarious.

1420
01:07:14,158 --> 01:07:16,911
You guys getting
fucked up?

1421
01:07:16,911 --> 01:07:20,247
Of course, dog, it's Friday.

1422
01:07:20,247 --> 01:07:22,583
Well, Boot,
you in the Academy yet?

1423
01:07:22,583 --> 01:07:24,585
Fuck no.

1424
01:07:24,668 --> 01:07:25,920
Fuck the LAPD.

1425
01:07:26,003 --> 01:07:28,506
It's local small-time bullshit.

1426
01:07:28,506 --> 01:07:29,590
I'm going with the feds.

1427
01:07:29,673 --> 01:07:30,758
How'd you get that hook-up, dog?

1428
01:07:30,758 --> 01:07:32,927
You know, me, got my
connects, you know.

1429
01:07:32,927 --> 01:07:34,011
Going to FLETC on Wednesday.

1430
01:07:34,094 --> 01:07:35,763
Hey, see you can
get me in there.

1431
01:07:35,763 --> 01:07:37,431
Yeah, I'll look into that.

1432
01:07:37,515 --> 01:07:39,266
How's Sylvia?

1433
01:07:39,266 --> 01:07:41,435
None of your concern,
ass wipe.

1434
01:07:41,519 --> 01:07:43,854
Say hi to her for me, no?

1435
01:07:43,854 --> 01:07:45,189
No.

1436
01:07:45,272 --> 01:07:48,859
<i>This vato's all protective
of his female.</i>

1437
01:07:48,859 --> 01:07:51,028
Check this out.

1438
01:07:52,613 --> 01:07:53,614
Nice, huh?

1439
01:07:53,697 --> 01:07:56,200
It's a nine?
Uh-huh.

1440
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:58,035
Sorry, dog, I got
a lot of nines.

1441
01:07:58,118 --> 01:07:59,620
Come on, dude,
it's a bad-ass Ruger.

1442
01:07:59,703 --> 01:08:01,956
Talk to Toussaint.
He'll buy that shit.

1443
01:08:02,039 --> 01:08:03,958
Toussaint, he's...
he's in Florida.

1444
01:08:03,958 --> 01:08:06,460
He's back.
He called me today.

1445
01:08:09,380 --> 01:08:10,881
Page me tonight, bro.

1446
01:08:10,965 --> 01:08:14,885
<i>We'll hit the clubs and
tear up some fine hinas.</i>

1447
01:08:14,885 --> 01:08:17,555
Later.
Sure, dog.

1448
01:08:17,638 --> 01:08:19,056
I'm on the City's time.

1449
01:08:19,140 --> 01:08:21,809
You guys be cool.

1450
01:08:21,809 --> 01:08:23,811
Okay?

1451
01:08:28,232 --> 01:08:29,900
That fuck--
he put a scare in me.

1452
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:31,235
Yeah, me, too.

1453
01:08:31,235 --> 01:08:32,403
He's a dick.

1454
01:08:32,403 --> 01:08:34,155
Want to party with him?

1455
01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:38,742
(hip-hop music playing)

1456
01:08:38,742 --> 01:08:41,245
See if this motherfucker's
home, dude.

1457
01:08:48,002 --> 01:08:52,840
Toussaint? Toussaint?!

1458
01:08:52,923 --> 01:08:54,008
Yo, Toussaint?

1459
01:08:54,008 --> 01:08:55,342
Yeah, come on, man.

1460
01:08:55,426 --> 01:08:59,263
Can't go far in that
little fucking place of yours.

1461
01:08:59,263 --> 01:09:01,348
Goddammit,
I'm coming.

1462
01:09:01,432 --> 01:09:03,267
Chill out.

1463
01:09:03,267 --> 01:09:04,768
(laughing)

1464
01:09:04,768 --> 01:09:06,187
Washing that dirty ass.

1465
01:09:10,274 --> 01:09:12,276
Damn it.

1466
01:09:12,359 --> 01:09:14,945
Group love. Group... Come on.

1467
01:09:15,029 --> 01:09:16,113
Group love, boys.

1468
01:09:16,197 --> 01:09:19,950
Welcome back, hometown.

1469
01:09:20,034 --> 01:09:23,454
Hey, I missed you
crazy fuckers, man.

1470
01:09:23,454 --> 01:09:24,955
Leo told us
you were back.

1471
01:09:25,039 --> 01:09:27,208
Thanks for calling
asshole.

1472
01:09:31,629 --> 01:09:35,132
You a cop?

1473
01:09:35,132 --> 01:09:36,467
Uh-uh. Going federal.

1474
01:09:37,301 --> 01:09:38,302
(whistles)

1475
01:09:38,302 --> 01:09:40,638
Man, craziest head I know

1476
01:09:40,721 --> 01:09:41,806
is going

1477
01:09:41,889 --> 01:09:42,807
to be a fed.

1478
01:09:42,890 --> 01:09:46,143
Yes, sir! Sir.

1479
01:09:46,143 --> 01:09:47,812
Still sponging off your woman?

1480
01:09:47,895 --> 01:09:50,314
Fuck you, dog. I got a job.

1481
01:09:50,314 --> 01:09:51,315
This motherfucker.

1482
01:09:51,398 --> 01:09:53,818
Look, dude.

1483
01:09:55,319 --> 01:09:57,321
This is bad.

1484
01:09:57,404 --> 01:09:59,907
It's yours for three
big ones, dog.

1485
01:09:59,990 --> 01:10:03,911
Fuck yeah, I want it.

1486
01:10:03,994 --> 01:10:07,581
What's up?
What's up?

1487
01:10:07,665 --> 01:10:09,333
Huh?

1488
01:10:09,333 --> 01:10:11,752
What the fuck you
say now, huh?

1489
01:10:11,836 --> 01:10:13,337
Hey. Huh?

1490
01:10:13,420 --> 01:10:16,006
Bam, bam, bam.

1491
01:10:16,090 --> 01:10:19,009
Motherfucker,
I'm strapped.

1492
01:10:19,093 --> 01:10:21,428
What the fuck
is up now, huh?

1493
01:10:21,512 --> 01:10:23,264
Whoo-ooh!

1494
01:10:23,264 --> 01:10:24,431
Whoa, whoa.

1495
01:10:24,515 --> 01:10:26,016
Your kneecap and shit.

1496
01:10:26,016 --> 01:10:30,437
Step up and get blasted.

1497
01:10:30,437 --> 01:10:34,441
Shit, man, what
the fuck is up now?

1498
01:10:34,441 --> 01:10:36,360
Hey, kick back, gunslinger.

1499
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:37,361
It's loaded.

1500
01:10:37,361 --> 01:10:38,696
That shit goes through walls.

1501
01:10:38,696 --> 01:10:39,864
You pop the neighbor's
little kids.

1502
01:10:39,947 --> 01:10:41,115
(cocks gun, bullets clinking)

1503
01:10:41,198 --> 01:10:42,366
Uh-oh.

1504
01:10:42,366 --> 01:10:43,701
Ooh.

1505
01:10:44,618 --> 01:10:47,538
Fuck, dude.

1506
01:10:47,538 --> 01:10:50,624
Whoa, I'm straight, bro.

1507
01:10:50,624 --> 01:10:54,879
Yo, guys, we got
to party tonight, you know?

1508
01:10:54,879 --> 01:10:56,714
Go clubbin' or something.

1509
01:10:56,714 --> 01:10:58,048
I got a better idea.

1510
01:10:58,048 --> 01:10:59,049
What?

1511
01:10:59,049 --> 01:11:00,050
Here, sir.

1512
01:11:02,052 --> 01:11:04,054
Let's go to Mexico.

1513
01:11:04,138 --> 01:11:05,723
Mexico?!

1514
01:11:05,723 --> 01:11:07,808
- Yeah.
- I'm in.

1515
01:11:10,060 --> 01:11:11,645
(all talking)

1516
01:11:11,729 --> 01:11:13,564
Only fags like that...

1517
01:11:13,564 --> 01:11:15,566
Because you're a little faggot.

1518
01:11:15,566 --> 01:11:17,067
I don't get it,
too much fucking hills.

1519
01:11:17,067 --> 01:11:18,152
Right, right.

1520
01:11:18,235 --> 01:11:21,572
Dude, yo, dude, stay back boy,
stay back.

1521
01:11:21,572 --> 01:11:23,908
Motherfucker's got to ask
permission.

1522
01:11:23,991 --> 01:11:26,827
Fuck you, all right?

1523
01:11:26,911 --> 01:11:28,662
Let me tell
you something.

1524
01:11:28,662 --> 01:11:30,664
I am a grown motherfucking man,
all right?

1525
01:11:30,748 --> 01:11:32,416
I'm going to tell her
the good news,

1526
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:34,752
make up, grab my shit
and we are out.

1527
01:11:34,835 --> 01:11:37,254
REPORTER:
Lines, lines, and more lines.

1528
01:11:37,254 --> 01:11:39,590
For many passengers
traveling through LAX,

1529
01:11:39,673 --> 01:11:41,759
the waiting has become
unbearable.

1530
01:11:41,759 --> 01:11:43,260
It's hit or miss,
you can't predict it...

1531
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:46,263
Excuse me, you're not
made out of glass.

1532
01:11:46,263 --> 01:11:47,264
I'm made out of me.

1533
01:11:47,264 --> 01:11:49,934
You're drunk.

1534
01:11:49,934 --> 01:11:51,435
I'm celebrating, baby.

1535
01:11:51,519 --> 01:11:52,853
What, another wasted day?

1536
01:11:54,730 --> 01:11:56,357
Here.

1537
01:11:56,440 --> 01:11:58,776
...security since 9-11,
but that's true everywhere.

1538
01:11:58,776 --> 01:12:01,946
...and still a recent study shows
the wait at LAX

1539
01:12:01,987 --> 01:12:03,531
is the third longest
in the world...

1540
01:12:07,284 --> 01:12:08,702
This is a good company.

1541
01:12:08,744 --> 01:12:10,913
They make all
the new condos downtown.

1542
01:12:10,955 --> 01:12:11,914
How much?

1543
01:12:11,956 --> 01:12:12,998
$12 an hour.

1544
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:13,999
Plus their MIS guy

1545
01:12:14,041 --> 01:12:15,209
is leaving in three months.

1546
01:12:15,292 --> 01:12:17,044
I'm going to update
my certifications

1547
01:12:17,086 --> 01:12:18,295
and take his job over.

1548
01:12:18,295 --> 01:12:19,463
Then I'll make bank.

1549
01:12:22,967 --> 01:12:24,718
Such an asshole.

1550
01:12:24,802 --> 01:12:26,720
What? Why?
This shit is real.

1551
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:28,722
This is a great job,
the pay is outstanding

1552
01:12:28,722 --> 01:12:31,642
and it's a great opportunity
for me to do what I want to do.

1553
01:12:31,684 --> 01:12:33,394
I know.

1554
01:12:33,477 --> 01:12:36,564
It's so... it's so Mike,
you know.

1555
01:12:36,647 --> 01:12:38,816
You can't just go out
and get a shitty job.

1556
01:12:38,899 --> 01:12:40,317
You gotta... you gotta get a...

1557
01:12:40,317 --> 01:12:41,318
A dream job?

1558
01:12:41,318 --> 01:12:42,653
Yeah, a dream job.

1559
01:12:42,695 --> 01:12:45,656
Well, why shouldn't your
dream guy have a dream job?

1560
01:12:45,656 --> 01:12:47,658
...the ambitious plans
of many opponents

1561
01:12:47,741 --> 01:12:50,661
on the County Board
of Supervisors...

1562
01:12:56,333 --> 01:12:58,085
(chuckles)

1563
01:12:58,169 --> 01:13:00,504
Come here, I have a job for you.

1564
01:13:04,758 --> 01:13:08,596
# Da-da-da-da, doo-rup #

1565
01:13:08,596 --> 01:13:11,932
# Da-da-da-da.
doo-rup. #

1566
01:13:12,016 --> 01:13:14,101
What the fuck
is taking so long?

1567
01:13:14,185 --> 01:13:15,686
I knew this
shit would happen.

1568
01:13:15,686 --> 01:13:17,021
She hates my ass.

1569
01:13:17,062 --> 01:13:19,356
She's not going
to let him go.

1570
01:13:19,356 --> 01:13:21,192
Go knock.

1571
01:13:22,818 --> 01:13:25,404
Dude, go knock.

1572
01:13:25,446 --> 01:13:29,867
Bro, drag his fucking
ass out of there.

1573
01:13:32,703 --> 01:13:34,330
(chuckles)

1574
01:13:37,041 --> 01:13:38,542
Yo, Miguel.

1575
01:13:41,045 --> 01:13:43,547
Hey.

1576
01:13:43,547 --> 01:13:46,467
Mike, hurry up.

1577
01:13:46,550 --> 01:13:48,135
(door opening)

1578
01:13:48,219 --> 01:13:49,553
Hey.

1579
01:13:49,553 --> 01:13:51,388
Yo, what the fuck
are you doing?

1580
01:13:51,472 --> 01:13:52,807
Come on, dude.

1581
01:13:52,807 --> 01:13:54,892
Dog, I'm tearin'
it up, man.

1582
01:13:54,975 --> 01:13:57,269
I'm hittin' it, bro.
It's been a few days.

1583
01:13:57,311 --> 01:13:59,980
You guys just go ahead, man.
I'm gonna chill.

1584
01:13:59,980 --> 01:14:01,398
What?

1585
01:14:01,398 --> 01:14:03,901
I'm just gonna kick it here
with the woman.

1586
01:14:03,901 --> 01:14:06,570
You said you'd go, man.

1587
01:14:06,612 --> 01:14:08,197
Your woman's in your head.

1588
01:14:08,197 --> 01:14:09,240
That's wrong.

1589
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:10,574
She's got your nuts, bro.

1590
01:14:10,574 --> 01:14:12,493
Dog, dog...

1591
01:14:12,576 --> 01:14:15,496
Sylvia's all happy 'cause I
got a job, all right, dude?

1592
01:14:15,538 --> 01:14:17,414
She wants us to
fuckin' chill together.

1593
01:14:17,414 --> 01:14:21,001
Man, that girl put
the zap on your head.

1594
01:14:21,085 --> 01:14:22,670
This is our last
chance to hang.

1595
01:14:22,670 --> 01:14:26,006
- You're like my brother.
- Yeah.

1596
01:14:26,090 --> 01:14:27,675
You're all I got.
You're gonna dog me like that?

1597
01:14:27,758 --> 01:14:29,051
I ain't no fucking do...

1598
01:14:29,093 --> 01:14:31,262
How are you, baby?

1599
01:14:31,262 --> 01:14:33,430
Hey, Sylvia, he's
going to Mexico.

1600
01:14:33,514 --> 01:14:36,809
No, he isn't, Jim.
Yes, he is.

1601
01:14:36,851 --> 01:14:40,855
I'm joining the feds. I'm gone,
I'm out of here next week.

1602
01:14:40,855 --> 01:14:42,439
The least
you can do

1603
01:14:42,439 --> 01:14:43,858
is let my best friend

1604
01:14:43,858 --> 01:14:45,192
see me off.

1605
01:14:45,192 --> 01:14:46,360
Baby, it's not safe.

1606
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:47,820
All you're going
to do is drink.

1607
01:14:47,862 --> 01:14:49,864
Aw, fuck, man.

1608
01:14:49,905 --> 01:14:51,615
Mike, come on.

1609
01:14:51,615 --> 01:14:53,492
Come on, fuck, man!

1610
01:14:53,534 --> 01:14:55,286
Come on,
you promised.

1611
01:14:55,369 --> 01:14:56,871
You promised, man.

1612
01:14:56,954 --> 01:15:02,042
Yo... I promised,
Sylvia, okay?

1613
01:15:02,126 --> 01:15:03,961
Mike, you're not
going to Mexico.

1614
01:15:04,003 --> 01:15:05,713
What?

1615
01:15:05,796 --> 01:15:07,298
You're not going.

1616
01:15:07,298 --> 01:15:10,467
I'm not your fucking
puppet, Sylvia.

1617
01:15:10,467 --> 01:15:12,845
All right, you know what,
do what you want.

1618
01:15:12,887 --> 01:15:15,139
But I'm not going to be
here when you get back.

1619
01:15:15,222 --> 01:15:16,390
That's fucked up.

1620
01:15:16,432 --> 01:15:18,392
Why you got to lay
that bullshit on him?

1621
01:15:18,476 --> 01:15:20,311
Because I don't want him
going with you, Jim.

1622
01:15:20,394 --> 01:15:22,396
You're fucking nuts.

1623
01:15:22,396 --> 01:15:24,648
You're crazy
and you're dangerous,

1624
01:15:24,732 --> 01:15:26,650
and my biggest nightmare
is you with a fucking badge.

1625
01:15:26,650 --> 01:15:28,152
You're the last person
who should have one.

1626
01:15:28,152 --> 01:15:29,153
Yeah?
Yeah.

1627
01:15:29,153 --> 01:15:30,321
That's not bullshit,
it's the truth.

1628
01:15:30,321 --> 01:15:31,614
Fuck this!

1629
01:15:31,655 --> 01:15:32,740
Whoa, wait.

1630
01:15:32,823 --> 01:15:34,241
Whatever, man.

1631
01:15:34,325 --> 01:15:36,827
Fuckin' thanks, homie!

1632
01:15:36,827 --> 01:15:37,912
Yeah, laters.

1633
01:15:37,995 --> 01:15:40,331
Bye.

1634
01:15:40,414 --> 01:15:41,749
Yo, yo.

1635
01:15:41,749 --> 01:15:43,083
I'm going.

1636
01:15:44,502 --> 01:15:45,503
I gotta go.

1637
01:15:45,503 --> 01:15:47,171
Get the fuck out
of here, go!

1638
01:15:48,506 --> 01:15:49,256
Go!

1639
01:15:49,298 --> 01:15:51,008
Fuck this shit, man.

1640
01:15:51,091 --> 01:15:52,343
Good night, Sylvia.

1641
01:15:52,426 --> 01:15:53,511
Kiss my ass, Jim.

1642
01:15:53,511 --> 01:15:55,554
Oh, any time, sellout.

1643
01:15:55,596 --> 01:15:58,224
Oh, you going to be happy
once he's dead? Huh?

1644
01:16:07,191 --> 01:16:08,526
Hey, Toussaint.

1645
01:16:08,526 --> 01:16:10,194
I heard the battle, man.

1646
01:16:10,236 --> 01:16:12,530
Yo, your lady didn't
want you going, huh?

1647
01:16:12,530 --> 01:16:14,031
No, but I'm going.

1648
01:16:14,031 --> 01:16:15,533
- Hell, yeah.
- Shit.

1649
01:16:15,616 --> 01:16:17,117
- I'm a motherfucking man.
- That's right.

1650
01:16:17,201 --> 01:16:19,203
Shit. I walk
the Earth at will.

1651
01:16:19,286 --> 01:16:21,163
- Damn right.
- I do whatever the fuck I want.

1652
01:16:21,205 --> 01:16:22,206
You know, we're men, right?

1653
01:16:22,289 --> 01:16:23,457
- We're men, right?
- That's right.

1654
01:16:23,541 --> 01:16:24,792
That's what we do, right?

1655
01:16:24,792 --> 01:16:26,460
Amen. And don't worry--

1656
01:16:26,460 --> 01:16:28,712
home girl will be right there
waiting when you get back.

1657
01:16:28,712 --> 01:16:29,880
You're right. You're right.

1658
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:31,090
She wouldn't play
that shit like that.

1659
01:16:31,131 --> 01:16:32,550
Shit, I got a fucking job
for real.

1660
01:16:32,550 --> 01:16:33,467
You did.

1661
01:16:33,467 --> 01:16:34,969
Plus you're my homie, dog.
You're my homie.

1662
01:16:35,136 --> 01:16:36,637
You're going to go fucking
do your thing

1663
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:38,472
- and this is it.
- No, shit, dude.

1664
01:16:38,556 --> 01:16:39,557
Yo, we're all dogs.

1665
01:16:39,557 --> 01:16:40,891
I got you guys
back, man.

1666
01:16:40,933 --> 01:16:41,976
No doubt,
no doubt.

1667
01:16:42,143 --> 01:16:43,727
It's just going to be
fucking cool, yo.

1668
01:16:43,811 --> 01:16:45,479
I got a job,
you got a job.

1669
01:16:45,563 --> 01:16:46,981
Shit, I got some bud.

1670
01:16:47,148 --> 01:16:48,399
- We got some smokes.
- We got some

1671
01:16:48,399 --> 01:16:50,151
- motherfucking money.
- We are on a mission.

1672
01:16:50,151 --> 01:16:53,154
Let's get our heads together
so we can achieve our objective

1673
01:16:53,154 --> 01:16:54,321
in a timely manner.

1674
01:16:54,321 --> 01:16:56,907
Let's get deployed, people.

1675
01:16:56,991 --> 01:16:58,159
(all yelling)

1676
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:00,494

##

1678
01:17:22,141 --> 01:17:24,226
Wake up, wake up, wake up.

1679
01:17:24,226 --> 01:17:25,352
Rise and fucking shine.

1680
01:17:25,436 --> 01:17:27,897
Come on, ladies.
Chow time.

1681
01:17:27,938 --> 01:17:29,106
Chow's getting cold.

1682
01:17:29,190 --> 01:17:32,193
MIKE: Oh, what the fuck, Jim?
Chill, dude.

1683
01:17:47,708 --> 01:17:49,293
Dude, where are we?

1684
01:17:49,376 --> 01:17:52,338
Family, man.

1685
01:17:52,379 --> 01:17:53,923
Damn!
It's a shizzack...

1686
01:17:53,964 --> 01:17:54,965
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1687
01:17:54,965 --> 01:17:57,468
It's a home, all right?

1688
01:17:57,468 --> 01:17:59,678
Respect, bro.

1689
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:01,555
Straighten up, fellas.

1690
01:18:04,975 --> 01:18:06,894
My old lady, Marta.

1691
01:18:06,936 --> 01:18:07,895
<i>Hola.</i>

1692
01:18:07,895 --> 01:18:09,063
<i>Mike.
Hola, mucho gusto.</i>

1693
01:18:09,104 --> 01:18:10,606
<i>Hola, Mike.
Toussaint.</i>

1694
01:18:10,606 --> 01:18:12,066
<i>Hola. Hola. Hola.</i>

<i>Mucho gusto. Marta's mom.</i>

<i>Buenos dias.</i>

1699

Vicki.
Vicki.

1700

<i>La prima, esa es mi prima.</i>

1701
01:18:21,158 --> 01:18:22,243
<i>Mucho gusto.</i>

1702
01:18:22,326 --> 01:18:23,494
<i>Mucho gusto. Mike. Vicki.</i>

1703
01:18:23,494 --> 01:18:25,204
Toussaint.

1704
01:18:25,246 --> 01:18:26,413
Vicki.

1705
01:18:26,497 --> 01:18:27,915
Okay.
(chuckles)

1706
01:18:27,998 --> 01:18:29,500
Hey, grab yourselves a rock.

1707
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:31,252
<i>Sí, por favor, sientense.</i>

1708
01:18:32,253 --> 01:18:33,546
(dog barks in distance)

1709
01:18:33,587 --> 01:18:34,588
MARTA:
Vicki?

1710
01:18:34,588 --> 01:18:36,257
<i>¿Café, quieren café?</i>

1711
01:18:36,340 --> 01:18:38,259
<i>Sí, café, por favor.
Vicki, andale.</i>

1712
01:18:38,259 --> 01:18:40,511
<i>Tranquila, baby.</i>

1713
01:18:42,179 --> 01:18:43,180
(laughs)

1714
01:18:43,180 --> 01:18:44,682
¡Mama!

1715
01:18:44,765 --> 01:18:46,851
Yeah, w-what's
she saying, dude?

1716
01:18:46,934 --> 01:18:48,936
Oh, they... they
think you're cool.

1717
01:18:49,019 --> 01:18:50,104
Oh, sweet.

1718
01:18:52,439 --> 01:18:54,275
<i>Aquí tienes. Gracias.</i>

1719
01:18:54,275 --> 01:18:56,610
<i>- Caliente.
- (whispers): Thank you.</i>

1720
01:19:00,447 --> 01:19:01,657
Dude...

1721
01:19:01,699 --> 01:19:03,117
Marta's fine as fuck, bro.

1722
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:04,326
Hey, hey, hey...

1723
01:19:04,368 --> 01:19:06,412
I'm just saying, dude.
You need to marry her, bro.

1724
01:19:06,453 --> 01:19:08,789
If you don't,
you're a fool.

1725
01:19:08,873 --> 01:19:10,958
<i>¿Que dice?</i>

1726
01:19:10,958 --> 01:19:13,961
Oh...

1727
01:19:13,961 --> 01:19:16,046
- Oh, that shit's good, man.
- (Spanish rock song plays)

1728
01:19:16,130 --> 01:19:18,632
No shit, you know they got that
good fucking weed from here.

1729
01:19:18,632 --> 01:19:21,552
That's what I want.
Some of that good shit.

1730
01:19:21,635 --> 01:19:23,971
You know where some fields
are or something, Jim?

1731
01:19:24,096 --> 01:19:26,557
Yeah, that's not... I want to
see, like, where they grow it.

1732
01:19:26,557 --> 01:19:27,725
You know, and then maybe

1733
01:19:27,766 --> 01:19:29,852
they'll let us go out
and, like, pick some.

1734
01:19:29,852 --> 01:19:31,979
You know, pick some of
that really good weed.

1735

1737
01:19:42,656 --> 01:19:43,824
Shit.

1738
01:19:43,908 --> 01:19:47,495
(cawing)

1739
01:19:49,246 --> 01:19:50,247
MIKE:
Toussaint?

1740
01:19:53,667 --> 01:19:55,002
(chuckles)

1741
01:19:55,085 --> 01:19:57,087
This is nice.

1742
01:19:57,171 --> 01:19:59,423
This is beautiful, man.

1743
01:19:59,507 --> 01:20:00,591
Dog, you see this?

1744
01:20:00,633 --> 01:20:02,927
Here.

1745
01:20:04,303 --> 01:20:05,304
Mmm...

1746
01:20:05,346 --> 01:20:06,514
Beautiful...

1747
01:20:06,514 --> 01:20:07,765
Man!

1748
01:20:07,848 --> 01:20:09,266
Mmm!

1749
01:20:09,266 --> 01:20:11,352
<i>When the hell'd you get
all the pistos, dog?</i>

<i>Mexico, man.</i>

1751
01:20:12,686 --> 01:20:13,687
It's magic.

1752
01:20:13,771 --> 01:20:15,022
(chuckles)

1753
01:20:15,105 --> 01:20:17,942

TOUSSAINT:
He bleed?

1755
01:20:19,109 --> 01:20:20,027
JIM:
Like a stuffed pig.

1756
01:20:20,110 --> 01:20:21,195
(Toussaint sighs)

1757
01:20:21,195 --> 01:20:23,030
How'd Letty know you were
tearing up her sister?

1758
01:20:23,072 --> 01:20:25,616
That fuckin' bitch Patti, right?

1759
01:20:25,658 --> 01:20:27,284
- Ah...
- I took her to dinner.

1760
01:20:27,368 --> 01:20:29,620
Took her for a cruise
up to Malibu, you know?

1761
01:20:29,703 --> 01:20:32,373
Got up all in it.
Back of my ride...

1762
01:20:32,414 --> 01:20:34,041
Pounded that fish, man.

1763
01:20:34,124 --> 01:20:35,459
Good fuckin' fish.

1764
01:20:35,501 --> 01:20:36,585
I figured the crazy broad

1765
01:20:36,627 --> 01:20:37,962
pulled out some hairs and pubes

1766
01:20:37,962 --> 01:20:39,713
and stashed it in the seat,
you know?

1767
01:20:39,713 --> 01:20:42,341
Oh, dude, you got to watch that
shit, man.

1768
01:20:42,341 --> 01:20:44,635
Chicks get treacherous.

1769
01:20:44,718 --> 01:20:47,304
Yeah, no shit.
Sibling rivalry, Jim.

1770
01:20:47,304 --> 01:20:48,722
(chuckles):
Next day,

1771
01:20:48,722 --> 01:20:51,183
I'm driving around with Letty
all kick back and shit,

1772
01:20:51,183 --> 01:20:54,562
and she radars in
on this rat's nest, man.

1773
01:20:54,645 --> 01:20:57,398
Pulls out these long-ass hairs,
she's like "What are these?"

1774
01:20:57,439 --> 01:20:58,399
"Whose are these?"

1775
01:20:58,440 --> 01:20:59,900
(cackling)

1776
01:20:59,984 --> 01:21:02,987
She sees all the pubes mixed in,
man... fuckin' busted.

1777
01:21:03,154 --> 01:21:04,989
Busted!
(singsong voice): Busted!

1778
01:21:05,156 --> 01:21:06,323
Oh!

1779
01:21:06,323 --> 01:21:08,659
Dude, how'd she know
they were her sister's?

1780
01:21:08,742 --> 01:21:10,161
Oh, come on, dude.

1781
01:21:10,244 --> 01:21:11,745
Mexican chick voodoo,
right, Mike?

1782
01:21:11,829 --> 01:21:13,330
You know,
live and learn.

1783
01:21:13,330 --> 01:21:15,833
Yep, next time you'll be all up
in your ride

1784
01:21:15,833 --> 01:21:17,668
with the Super
Vac, dude.
Treachery!

1785
01:21:17,751 --> 01:21:19,753
Yep, treachery.

1786
01:21:19,837 --> 01:21:21,422
(dog barking in distance)

1787
01:21:21,463 --> 01:21:22,464
(horse snorts)

1788
01:21:25,759 --> 01:21:27,845
Um...

1789
01:21:27,845 --> 01:21:29,597
shouldn't we be

1790
01:21:29,597 --> 01:21:30,806
helping them?

1791
01:21:30,848 --> 01:21:32,349
You know how to hand wash?

1792
01:21:32,391 --> 01:21:33,934
- No.
- Then don't sweat it.

1793
01:21:33,976 --> 01:21:35,019
Yeah, we're men.

1794
01:21:35,186 --> 01:21:36,604
They know we don't do that shit.

1795
01:21:36,687 --> 01:21:37,605
That's right.

1796
01:21:37,646 --> 01:21:39,023
We're men.

1797
01:21:39,023 --> 01:21:40,858
(chuckling)

1798
01:21:40,858 --> 01:21:42,193
Oh, yeah!

1799
01:21:43,861 --> 01:21:45,404
(sighs)

1800
01:21:45,404 --> 01:21:46,614
This is paradise, huh?

1801
01:21:46,697 --> 01:21:48,032
Mm-hmm.

1802
01:21:49,867 --> 01:21:51,452
Yo, Mike?

1803
01:21:51,535 --> 01:21:52,953
Yeah?

1804
01:21:53,037 --> 01:21:54,246
They're sending me to Colombia.

1805
01:21:59,877 --> 01:22:02,630
Colombia.

1806
01:22:02,671 --> 01:22:04,298
Who, the man?

1807
01:22:04,381 --> 01:22:06,258
Yep.

1808
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:08,469
They're tearing shit up down
there, they need my help.

1809
01:22:08,552 --> 01:22:10,387
Doing what?

1810
01:22:10,387 --> 01:22:12,306
Busting up drug labs
and drug lords

1811
01:22:12,306 --> 01:22:13,974
- and all that shit.
- You got it.

1812
01:22:14,058 --> 01:22:16,477
Gonna be an advisor, you know--
shoot him, him and him.

1813
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:18,646
Then it's back to the barracks
for bitches and beer.

1814
01:22:18,729 --> 01:22:20,564
I'm set.

1815
01:22:20,564 --> 01:22:22,733
Why do you want to do
that shit, dude?

1816
01:22:22,733 --> 01:22:24,318
I mean...

1817
01:22:24,401 --> 01:22:27,696
what about Marta, you know?

1818
01:22:27,738 --> 01:22:28,739
I mean...

1819
01:22:28,823 --> 01:22:30,741
Ain't gonna happen.

1820
01:22:30,783 --> 01:22:33,244
They told me not to get married.

1821
01:22:33,244 --> 01:22:35,162
TOUSSAINT:
That's messed.

1822
01:22:35,246 --> 01:22:36,247
They really told you that?

1823
01:22:36,330 --> 01:22:38,040
Not straight up,
but I heard 'em.

1824
01:22:38,082 --> 01:22:40,918
Yo, if the feds won't let you
hook up with your old lady,

1825
01:22:40,918 --> 01:22:42,586
you need to tell them
to fuck off.

1826
01:22:42,670 --> 01:22:44,088
Yeah, I mean,

1827
01:22:44,088 --> 01:22:46,757
you love her,
she loves you, right?

1828
01:22:46,841 --> 01:22:49,426
Dude, you need to move
down here, marry Marta,

1829
01:22:49,510 --> 01:22:50,928
you know, get a good-ass job

1830
01:22:51,011 --> 01:22:53,597
working with fucking
tourists or something.

1831
01:22:53,597 --> 01:22:55,015
Fuck that.

1832
01:22:55,015 --> 01:22:57,309
Taking bucket baths
in cold-ass water?

1833
01:22:57,351 --> 01:22:59,186
You know, wading around
in ankle-deep mud?

1834
01:22:59,186 --> 01:23:00,187
Outhouses, man!

1835
01:23:00,271 --> 01:23:02,189
Fuckin' outhouses!

1836
01:23:02,273 --> 01:23:04,275
You told Marta yet?

1837
01:23:08,195 --> 01:23:09,822
You love this place.

1838
01:23:09,864 --> 01:23:13,117
It's in your eyes, man.

1839
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:15,619
Dude, this is
what it's all about.

1840
01:23:15,619 --> 01:23:19,874
You got a woman that loves
you and a place to stay.

1841
01:23:19,957 --> 01:23:21,542
You'd be happy here,
and you know it.

1842
01:23:21,625 --> 01:23:25,880
Yeah, well,
shacking up with Marta,

1843
01:23:25,963 --> 01:23:31,051
squeezing out some puppies,
has its appeal, but...

1844
01:23:31,135 --> 01:23:34,388
this is my career.

1845
01:23:34,430 --> 01:23:36,432
I got one shot.

1846
01:23:36,474 --> 01:23:38,017
You're making
a mistake.

1847
01:23:38,142 --> 01:23:42,813
You should stay right
here with your lady.

1848
01:23:42,897 --> 01:23:44,273
What the fuck you gonna do

1849
01:23:44,273 --> 01:23:46,150
in Colombia?

1850
01:23:48,402 --> 01:23:50,321
Whack people,

1851
01:23:50,321 --> 01:23:51,572
program shit.

1852
01:23:51,614 --> 01:23:54,241
You ain't down, fuck you.

1853
01:23:54,325 --> 01:23:56,160
Bring in my gunships

1854
01:23:56,243 --> 01:23:59,246
and smoke your little jungle
hideaway. You know?

1855
01:23:59,330 --> 01:24:00,956
I mean, I'm a solider
of the apocalypse, man.

1856
01:24:00,956 --> 01:24:02,166
I'll be in a chopper,

1857
01:24:02,249 --> 01:24:05,920
door-gunning villagers
and shit. Fuck 'em.

1858
01:24:06,003 --> 01:24:08,797
Kill the chickens
and dogs, too, man.

1859
01:24:08,839 --> 01:24:10,174
(can clatters)

1860
01:24:10,174 --> 01:24:12,676
I don't give a fuck.

Yeah.

MIKE:
Doce años.

1873
01:26:18,969 --> 01:26:20,554
- Doce años.
- JIM: Doce años...

1874
01:26:20,554 --> 01:26:22,765
Doce... we've been
together that long.

1875

<i>Es muy bonita.</i>

1876

Man, you're bring sand
to the beach, dumb ass.

1877
01:26:25,476 --> 01:26:27,728
- Cover that shit up.
- TOUSSAINT: Jim, dude!

1878
01:26:27,728 --> 01:26:28,896
Huh?

1879
01:26:28,979 --> 01:26:31,398
How you say, um, "You're
beautiful" in Spanish?

1880

<i>Tu... bonita.</i>

<i>VICKI:
Gracias.</i>

1885

MIKE:
Hey, baby, see my new one?

1886
01:26:42,159 --> 01:26:43,494
- Right, did I get it?
- Huh?

1887
01:26:43,494 --> 01:26:44,745
Think I got it?

1888
01:26:44,829 --> 01:26:47,915
Yeah, she got the point.

1889
01:26:51,085 --> 01:26:54,505
Yo, Mike, that chick digs you.

1890
01:26:54,547 --> 01:26:56,340
What chick?

1891
01:26:57,925 --> 01:26:59,927
MIKE:
Oh, she's good, dog.

1892
01:27:00,010 --> 01:27:02,179
Yeah, name's Lila.

1893
01:27:02,179 --> 01:27:04,265
She's a freak.
She'll fuck you, dude.

1894

(laughs)

1895
01:27:05,766 --> 01:27:07,518
She's a freak, huh?

1896
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:09,186
How you know? You fuck her?

1897
01:27:09,228 --> 01:27:11,272
No, out of respect
for Marta.

1898
01:27:11,313 --> 01:27:14,441
Not that I don't want...
Hey, baby.

1899
01:27:14,525 --> 01:27:17,987
Ask her to dance.

1900
01:27:18,070 --> 01:27:20,156
I'm not cheating
on Sylvia, dude.

1901

(song ends,
partygoers applaud)

1902
01:27:21,949 --> 01:27:25,202
There's a big gap between
dancing and fucking, man.

1903
01:27:25,202 --> 01:27:27,121
Go explore it.

1904
01:27:28,289 --> 01:27:29,957
No shit.

1905
01:27:29,999 --> 01:27:32,376

No.

You're fucking nuts.

1914
01:31:40,457 --> 01:31:42,626
You fucked up, woman.

1915
01:31:44,295 --> 01:31:46,297
I'll do it.

Where's Toussaint?

He's dancing.

- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1926

- You gonna get back

1927
01:32:45,189 --> 01:32:46,357
to the party?
- Yeah.

1928

Let's get back
to the party, man.

1929

go tell Toussaint that

1931

we're gonna get the
fuck out of here, man.

1932

Just go into the party,
tell him we're gonna go.

I'm having a
great time, bro.

1943

is your problem, psycho?!

1948
01:33:35,156 --> 01:33:36,907
Hey, hey, homeboy's
losing it, all right?

1949
01:33:36,907 --> 01:33:39,910
Shut the fuck up and just
get in the car, all right?

1950
01:33:39,994 --> 01:33:40,995
Fucking bullshit!

1951
01:33:41,078 --> 01:33:43,414
(engine starts)

1952
01:33:43,497 --> 01:33:44,832
TOUSSAINT:
Fucked up!

1953
01:33:50,254 --> 01:33:52,089
(crying)

1954
01:33:53,174 --> 01:33:55,593
(transmission revving,
tires squealing)

1955
01:34:07,605 --> 01:34:09,607
(tires squealing)

1956
01:34:13,861 --> 01:34:17,281
Dude, dude... dude, slow down.

1957
01:34:17,364 --> 01:34:20,618
(tires squealing)

1958
01:34:20,701 --> 01:34:22,203
Fuck, man.

1959
01:34:22,286 --> 01:34:25,873
Whoo, yeah, man.

1960
01:34:25,873 --> 01:34:27,541
Slow down,
you crazy motherfucker!

1961
01:34:27,541 --> 01:34:30,294
I want a cop to pull me over.

1962
01:34:31,879 --> 01:34:34,131
JIM:
Treachery.

1963
01:34:34,131 --> 01:34:36,050
Fucking treachery.

1964
01:34:36,050 --> 01:34:38,385
Jim, slow down!

1965
01:34:38,385 --> 01:34:39,553
Shut up!

1966
01:34:40,721 --> 01:34:42,139
Fuck, dude.

1967
01:34:42,890 --> 01:34:45,142
Only female I trust.

1968
01:34:45,142 --> 01:34:47,228
(transmission revs,
tire squeal)

1969
01:34:47,228 --> 01:34:49,063
Fuck you, God!

1970
01:34:49,146 --> 01:34:52,650
You ain't got the fucking balls
to take my ass.

1971
01:34:54,235 --> 01:34:57,738
Jim, don't say that shit, dude.

1972
01:35:12,837 --> 01:35:14,004
Jim!

1973
01:35:14,004 --> 01:35:15,005
(brakes screeching)

1974
01:35:17,007 --> 01:35:20,594
Dude, you are getting
out of control, okay?

1975
01:35:20,678 --> 01:35:23,180
You need psychiatric
help, man.

1976
01:35:23,180 --> 01:35:26,517
You're seriously
fucked up, dude.

1977
01:35:26,517 --> 01:35:32,022
All right, you need to sue
the military or something.

1978
01:35:32,022 --> 01:35:33,774
You used to be mellow.

1979
01:35:37,111 --> 01:35:38,362
Later, homie.

1980
01:35:38,445 --> 01:35:40,197
'Night, dog.

1981
01:35:40,197 --> 01:35:42,449
Laters.

1982
01:35:42,449 --> 01:35:44,451
Dude, I ain't hanging
around you anymore

1983
01:35:44,451 --> 01:35:45,786
until you get
some fucking help.

1984
01:35:45,786 --> 01:35:48,539
You can 12-step off, bitch.

1985
01:35:48,539 --> 01:35:50,875
You're dismissed.

1986
01:36:03,637 --> 01:36:05,389
He's right, dude.

1987
01:36:05,473 --> 01:36:06,474
Yeah.

1988
01:36:09,393 --> 01:36:11,896
Georgia will get me
squared away.

1989
01:36:11,979 --> 01:36:14,815
Hope so.

1990
01:36:14,815 --> 01:36:18,319
What was that shit
with Marta, dude?

1991
01:36:18,319 --> 01:36:23,073
I don't know why that happened.

1992
01:36:25,242 --> 01:36:27,328
But I'm cool.
I'm cool now.

1993
01:36:27,411 --> 01:36:29,246
Okay?

1994
01:36:31,165 --> 01:36:32,166
Yeah.

1995
01:36:32,166 --> 01:36:33,834
I'm cool.

1996
01:36:44,929 --> 01:36:47,264
Look, dude, she told me
she was pregnant.

1997
01:36:47,264 --> 01:36:49,016
I had a panic attack.

1998
01:36:49,099 --> 01:36:50,184
I pulled my gun.

1999
01:36:50,184 --> 01:36:51,435
Come on, dog,

2000
01:36:51,435 --> 01:36:53,187
I thought you loved her, dude.

2001
01:36:53,270 --> 01:36:55,773
I do.

2002
01:36:55,773 --> 01:36:57,858
God, fuck.

2003
01:36:57,858 --> 01:37:00,611
Come on, man, let's
go drop off that bud.

2004
01:37:04,031 --> 01:37:05,282
What bud?

2005
01:37:05,366 --> 01:37:08,202
There's 20 kilos in the trunk.

2006
01:37:08,202 --> 01:37:09,537
Say that again?

2007
01:37:09,537 --> 01:37:11,705
There's 20 kilos
in the trunk, man.

2008
01:37:11,789 --> 01:37:13,290
(laughing)

2009
01:37:13,290 --> 01:37:14,625
- Of weed?
- Yeah.

2010
01:37:14,625 --> 01:37:15,960
Get the fuck out of here, man.

2011
01:37:15,960 --> 01:37:17,461
I picked it up at the party.

2012
01:37:17,461 --> 01:37:19,797
I'm dropping it at Casper's.

2013
01:37:19,880 --> 01:37:21,465
Casper's?

2014
01:37:21,549 --> 01:37:23,300
(laughing):
I get three Gs.

2015
01:37:23,300 --> 01:37:26,387
We get three Gs.

2016
01:37:26,387 --> 01:37:27,972
You drove it across the border?

2017
01:37:28,055 --> 01:37:30,141
(laughing):
Yeah.

2018
01:37:30,141 --> 01:37:31,475
What if they would've caught us?

2019
01:37:31,475 --> 01:37:33,310
Couldn't happen, man.

2020
01:37:33,310 --> 01:37:36,897
My shit is on fire
right now, man.

2021
01:37:36,981 --> 01:37:39,567
My shit is wired
right now, man.

2022
01:37:39,650 --> 01:37:41,735
You risked my ass
without telling me?

2023
01:37:41,819 --> 01:37:44,572
That's not cool, man.
For three fucking Gs?

2024
01:37:44,655 --> 01:37:47,324
That's... that's a good rate
for transporting that.

2025
01:37:47,324 --> 01:37:49,326
Shit, if I'd
told you,

2026
01:37:49,326 --> 01:37:50,494
you would have gotten

2027
01:37:50,578 --> 01:37:53,164
all fucking hinkey at the
border, man, gotten us nabbed.

2028
01:37:53,247 --> 01:37:55,166
I wouldn't have been
in the fucking car, dude!

2029
01:37:55,249 --> 01:37:57,585
I would've been on
motherfucking Greyhound.

2030
01:37:57,668 --> 01:37:59,587
That's a serious breach
of the homie code, man,

2031
01:37:59,670 --> 01:38:01,255
not fuckin' telling me.

2032
01:38:01,255 --> 01:38:03,924
I'm sorry, man.
I'm sorry, you know.

2033
01:38:04,091 --> 01:38:06,260
I should've had...
I should've got you guys,

2034
01:38:06,260 --> 01:38:07,845
you know,
walk across the border.

2035
01:38:07,845 --> 01:38:09,346
I could've met
you somewhere.

2036
01:38:09,346 --> 01:38:11,515
But, you know, I got
bills, I got shit.

2037
01:38:11,599 --> 01:38:12,850
I gotta put my shit
in storage.

2038
01:38:12,933 --> 01:38:15,186
I gotta get gas
out to Georgia.

2039
01:38:15,269 --> 01:38:17,188
Oh, fuck your money woes, dog!

2040
01:38:17,188 --> 01:38:19,273
I am not catching
a fuckin' case for you.

2041
01:38:19,356 --> 01:38:21,275
Let me out of the fucking car
right now.

2042
01:38:21,275 --> 01:38:22,860
Fuck, man. Come on, man,
let's drop this shit off.

2043
01:38:22,943 --> 01:38:23,861
Let's get paid!

2044
01:38:23,944 --> 01:38:25,362
Let me out right here.

2045
01:38:25,446 --> 01:38:26,864
Mi-Mi-Mi-Mike! Listen, listen!

2046
01:38:26,864 --> 01:38:28,199
Let me out right here,
right now!

2047
01:38:28,282 --> 01:38:30,201
You will feel so much better
with a fistful of twenties.

2048
01:38:30,284 --> 01:38:31,869
Huh?

2049
01:38:32,953 --> 01:38:35,456
Dude, we're drunk,

2050
01:38:35,539 --> 01:38:38,125
and we got a trunk full of
fuckin' weed, dude, I am not...

2051
01:38:38,209 --> 01:38:40,711
Okay, fuckin', Mike,
don't bitch out on me!

2052
01:38:40,711 --> 01:38:43,881
Don't fucking bitch out on me!

2053
01:38:43,881 --> 01:38:45,382
I am still on probation,
dick head.

2054
01:38:45,466 --> 01:38:46,967
Let me out now!

2055
01:38:47,051 --> 01:38:48,219
Let me out right here
right fuckin' now, dude!

2056
01:38:48,219 --> 01:38:49,970
Let me get paid, will you?

2057
01:38:50,054 --> 01:38:51,472
Will you fuckin'
let me get paid?!

2058
01:38:51,555 --> 01:38:52,556
Oh, yo, get paid, man.

2059
01:38:52,640 --> 01:38:54,642
Fuckin' go for it,
all right?

2060
01:38:54,725 --> 01:38:57,144
Just let me get the fuck out.
I don't give a fuck, dude.

2061
01:39:00,898 --> 01:39:03,484
What the fuck
are you doing, man?

2062
01:39:03,484 --> 01:39:04,735
(yelling hysterically)

2063
01:39:04,735 --> 01:39:06,987
What the fuck
are you doing, Jim?

2064
01:39:07,071 --> 01:39:08,572
What the fuck?
What the fuck?

2065
01:39:08,656 --> 01:39:09,740
Fuck you!

2066
01:39:16,747 --> 01:39:19,583
Fuck, I'm sorry, dude,

2067
01:39:19,583 --> 01:39:20,668
I'm sorry, dude.

2068
01:39:20,751 --> 01:39:22,753
Okay? I'm sorry.

2069
01:39:22,753 --> 01:39:25,089
Why the fuck did you put
a gun to my head?

2070
01:39:25,089 --> 01:39:27,842
Huh?

2071
01:39:27,925 --> 01:39:29,260
You gonna shoot me?

2072
01:39:29,260 --> 01:39:32,012
No, man. I'm sorry.
I was trippin'.

2073
01:39:32,096 --> 01:39:36,267
I'd never...

2074
01:39:36,267 --> 01:39:39,436
I'd never put a fuckin' gun
to your head, dude

2075
01:39:39,436 --> 01:39:40,604
I know.

2076
01:39:40,688 --> 01:39:43,107
I know you wouldn't, man.
I'm sorry.

2077
01:39:43,190 --> 01:39:45,609
First your lady, now me, man.
What the fuck is up?

2078
01:39:45,609 --> 01:39:47,611
I'm not thinking.

2079
01:39:47,611 --> 01:39:49,113
I got too much shit going on.

2080
01:39:49,113 --> 01:39:52,867
(sniffling)

2081
01:39:52,867 --> 01:39:56,287
Oh, fuck, I'm just faded,
man, that's all.

2082
01:39:56,370 --> 01:39:58,289
I'm just fuckin'
fade right now, okay?

2083
01:39:58,372 --> 01:39:59,874
I'll cruise
you by your pad.

2084
01:39:59,874 --> 01:40:01,041
I'll drop you
off, man.

2085
01:40:01,041 --> 01:40:02,209
I'm sorry.

2086
01:40:02,293 --> 01:40:03,377
I'm sorry.

2087
01:40:03,461 --> 01:40:05,963
Yeah. You're a fuck-up.

2088
01:40:08,299 --> 01:40:11,969
I'm going with you so you
don't fuck this shit up, too.

2089
01:40:12,052 --> 01:40:16,557
We'll go to Casper's...
get the money.

2090
01:40:16,557 --> 01:40:17,558
Yeah.

2091
01:40:17,558 --> 01:40:19,059
Then you can
drop me off home,

2092
01:40:19,059 --> 01:40:21,896
you can go to Georgia fed out
and be the fuckin' man.

2093
01:40:21,896 --> 01:40:25,399
Yeah, I'm gonna be
the fucking man.

2094
01:40:25,399 --> 01:40:26,984
I can drop you
off, you know.

2095
01:40:26,984 --> 01:40:28,736
Take you up the hill.

2096
01:40:28,736 --> 01:40:30,154
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2097
01:40:30,154 --> 01:40:33,073
No.

2098
01:40:33,157 --> 01:40:36,660
Keep on going.

2099
01:40:44,001 --> 01:40:45,002
MIKE:
Looks sketchy.

2100
01:40:45,002 --> 01:40:47,087
JIM:
I don't know.

2101
01:40:51,258 --> 01:40:53,427
Ho, what, you gonna
shoot their pigeons?

2102
01:40:53,511 --> 01:40:54,595
Yeah.

2103
01:40:54,678 --> 01:40:55,930
Just hurry up.

2104
01:41:08,776 --> 01:41:10,194
Yo, Casper!

2105
01:41:14,782 --> 01:41:16,283
<i>Buenos noches, señor.</i>

2111
01:41:53,237 --> 01:41:54,822

Sorry to hear that, dog.

You play, you pay.

He knew what time it was.

2128
01:42:19,680 --> 01:42:21,348
Right.

2129
01:42:21,348 --> 01:42:23,017
Hey, we gotta bounce.

2130
01:42:23,100 --> 01:42:24,351
You got the money?

Yeah, just let me

Yo, bring the feria, homey!

JIM:
Oh, fuck it!

01:42:38,199 --> 01:42:40,034
CASPER: Yeah, now she can

01:42:40,034 --> 01:42:41,285
FLACO: I got all the feria

2138
01:42:41,368 --> 01:42:43,120
It's all rolled

2139
01:42:43,204 --> 01:42:44,038
You know what I mean?

Ready to go, dog.
Check this out, homes.

<i>I know these fools.

Fuck these motherfuckers!
I'm shooting both of 'em!

2146
01:42:53,297 --> 01:42:55,549
At least give the homeboy
a pass right here, dog.

2147
01:42:55,633 --> 01:42:56,717
Yeah, yeah,

2148
01:42:56,717 --> 01:42:57,802
I don't give a fuck.

2149
01:42:57,802 --> 01:42:59,303
I want this white boy
in a box, though.

2150
01:42:59,303 --> 01:43:00,387
Hey, you in the ride.

2153
01:43:04,475 --> 01:43:05,810
Hey, just get the fuck

2154
01:43:05,810 --> 01:43:07,311
JIM:
Take off, homey.

2155
01:43:07,394 --> 01:43:09,396
I'll be cool.

2156
01:43:17,071 --> 01:43:18,739
What the fuck?

2157
01:43:19,824 --> 01:43:21,242
<i>Don't trip, ese.
I'm cool.</i>

2158
01:43:23,911 --> 01:43:25,079
Chill, dog! Chill, dog!

2159
01:43:25,162 --> 01:43:26,664
I got three kids...

(dog barks in distance)

2164
01:43:41,595 --> 01:43:42,596
(raspy breathing)

2165
01:43:48,435 --> 01:43:50,104
(engine starts)

2166
01:43:51,689 --> 01:43:53,023
Why the fuck
did you do that?

2167
01:43:53,023 --> 01:43:54,525
(both shouting)

2168
01:43:54,525 --> 01:43:56,777
(tires screeching)

2169
01:43:56,777 --> 01:43:57,778
JIM:
Pull the door!

2170
01:44:40,988 --> 01:44:42,406
- (engine revving)
- Oh, my God, Jim!

2171
01:44:42,490 --> 01:44:43,407
I'm hit bad.

2172
01:44:43,407 --> 01:44:44,909
What have we done?

2173
01:44:44,909 --> 01:44:47,161
I can't move my arm...
and I can't feel my legs!

2174
01:44:47,161 --> 01:44:48,412
(whimpers)

2175
01:44:48,496 --> 01:44:50,664
I can't move shit.

2176
01:44:50,664 --> 01:44:52,917
I'm fucked up.
I'm fucked up.

2177
01:44:52,917 --> 01:44:54,251
I'm fucked up.

MIKE:
Okay...

Don't trip...

2182
01:45:08,098 --> 01:45:09,600
Don't trip, dog.

2183
01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:11,769
County Hospital's

2184
01:45:11,852 --> 01:45:13,187
No! No! No!
County Hospital...

2185
01:45:13,187 --> 01:45:14,688
Don't you dare
take me there!

2186
01:45:14,688 --> 01:45:16,524
Don't you dare!

2187
01:45:16,607 --> 01:45:18,275
I'm not going
out like that.

2188
01:45:18,275 --> 01:45:19,443
No, we're going.
No, no...

2189

No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, we're going.

2190

No medical treatment.
No medical treatment.

2191
01:45:23,113 --> 01:45:24,782
But, but...

2192

Mike, Mike...

2193

You gotta kill me.
You gotta kill me.

You gotta kill me.

2195
01:45:31,121 --> 01:45:34,625
Why? Why?

I fucked up.

2197
01:45:37,711 --> 01:45:38,879
Everything's shitty.

No, no...

2199
01:45:40,881 --> 01:45:42,550

2203
01:45:50,975 --> 01:45:52,476
No, everything's
gonna be fine.

2204
01:45:52,560 --> 01:45:53,978
Jim, shh-shh, shh-shh,
shh-shh, shh-shh.

2205
01:45:53,978 --> 01:45:55,062
Everything's gonna
be fine.

2206
01:45:55,146 --> 01:45:56,397
Everything's gonna be fine.

2207
01:45:56,397 --> 01:45:58,649
Take a look at me,
you dumb fuck!

2208
01:45:58,732 --> 01:46:01,152
Everything's gonna be fine?!

2209
01:46:01,152 --> 01:46:02,987
Come on...

2210
01:46:03,070 --> 01:46:05,990
You take my piece...

2211
01:46:05,990 --> 01:46:07,992
and you put it
to my fuckin' head...

2212
01:46:08,075 --> 01:46:11,162
and you pull
the trigger.

2213
01:46:11,162 --> 01:46:12,913
You fuckin' step up...

2214
01:46:12,997 --> 01:46:14,665
No...

2215
01:46:14,748 --> 01:46:15,583
...and you do it.

2216
01:46:15,666 --> 01:46:16,750
No.

2217
01:46:16,834 --> 01:46:18,669
'Cause I can't.

(moans)

2220
01:46:24,341 --> 01:46:26,427
(sobbing):
Don't be a fuckin' pussy.

2221
01:46:26,427 --> 01:46:27,761
Oh, my God...

2222
01:46:27,761 --> 01:46:29,263
Don't think about it.

2223
01:46:29,263 --> 01:46:31,015
Huh?

2224
01:46:31,015 --> 01:46:32,016
Do it.

2225
01:46:32,016 --> 01:46:34,268
Please.

2226
01:46:34,351 --> 01:46:35,352
Just kill you and bail?

2227
01:46:35,436 --> 01:46:37,771
Yeah.

2228
01:46:37,771 --> 01:46:39,356
Just take off.

2229
01:46:39,356 --> 01:46:41,859
And don't look back...

2230
01:46:41,942 --> 01:46:43,444
or you'll...

2231
01:46:43,527 --> 01:46:47,114
or you'll turn into
a pillar of salt.

2232
01:46:47,198 --> 01:46:49,450
Hey... Hey...

2233
01:46:49,533 --> 01:46:52,453
you wanted to know what it was
like to kill someone.

2234
01:46:52,453 --> 01:46:56,207
What's up, huh?

2235
01:46:56,290 --> 01:46:57,458
No one's gonna know.

2236
01:46:57,541 --> 01:47:00,044
Hmm?

2237
01:47:00,127 --> 01:47:01,879
Just you...

2238
01:47:01,962 --> 01:47:03,964

2239
01:47:03,964 --> 01:47:05,633
And God.

2240

No fuckin' way.

2241
01:47:07,301 --> 01:47:08,719
- Huh?
- No fuckin' way.

2242
01:47:08,719 --> 01:47:10,721
You're crazy; I'm not
shootin' you, dog.

2243
01:47:10,805 --> 01:47:11,972
It's mercy, dog.

2244
01:47:12,056 --> 01:47:14,141
It's mercy.

2245
01:47:14,225 --> 01:47:16,811
I deserve that.

2246
01:47:16,894 --> 01:47:18,479
I'd do it for you.

2247
01:47:20,064 --> 01:47:21,649
I'd do it for you.

2248
01:47:22,233 --> 01:47:25,486
Yeah.

2249

Take it.

2250
01:47:27,571 --> 01:47:29,156
Yeah, yeah.

2251
01:47:33,911 --> 01:47:36,914
JIM (gasping):
Yeah, yeah... yeah...

2252
01:47:42,837 --> 01:47:45,422
D-Don't, don't
think about it.

2253
01:47:45,506 --> 01:47:46,674
Don't think about it.

2254
01:47:49,260 --> 01:47:51,011
Yeah, yeah...

2255

Yeah.

2257

Ah... ah...

2258
01:47:57,685 --> 01:48:01,188
You did this to yourself,
you stupid fuck!

2259
01:48:01,272 --> 01:48:02,439
You're always doing
stupid shit!

2260
01:48:02,523 --> 01:48:04,275
- I gotta fuckin' fix it!
- Okay, okay.

2261
01:48:04,358 --> 01:48:05,526
Is that what you
fuckin' want?!

2262
01:48:05,609 --> 01:48:06,694
- Yes.
- Huh?

2263
01:48:06,777 --> 01:48:08,195
You want me to fuckin'
fix your head,

2264
01:48:08,279 --> 01:48:09,780
- once and for all?!
- Come on, it's easy.

2265
01:48:09,780 --> 01:48:11,115
It's easy.
No! Bullshit!

2266
01:48:11,198 --> 01:48:12,700
