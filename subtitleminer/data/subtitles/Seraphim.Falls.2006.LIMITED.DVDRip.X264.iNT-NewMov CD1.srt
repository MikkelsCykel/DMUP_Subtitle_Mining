1
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:22,134
Well, we definitely got him.

2
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:26,330
It's a gut shot, but we got him pretty good.

3
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:28,636
He didn't even take his rifle.

4
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,676
His horse run off, though.

5
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:32,938
Cleared up some.
We ought to get a move on.

6
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:34,843
Let him bleed.

7
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:38,916
If he keeps going down,
he's going to get some distance on us.

8
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:44,614
He ain't going nowhere.

9
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:49,761
We let him bleed.

10
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,974
Well, let's just get paid up
and be done with it.

11
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,571
- He went in.
- Yep.

12
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:41,809
There's no tracks on the other side.
He done gone over them falls.

13
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:44,055
Ain't no body.

14
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:46,414
Well, he went in that there water...

15
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,889
There ain't no body.
There ain't gonna be no body.

16
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:53,261
- There's always a body.
- You expect us just to conjure him?

17
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,901
I expect you to find him.
That's what I'm paying you for.

18
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:30,521
Stay, stay.

19
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:34,696
Stay.

20
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:41,221
Oh, God.

21
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:18,655
Oh, God. Oh, God.

22
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:37,209
Y'all smell that?

23
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:43,138
Oh, fuck.

24
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:16,238
Don't touch it.

25
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:34,382
He's doubled back on his tracks.
Hayes, you and the kid follow those two.

26
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,394
Pope, you take that one.

27
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,725
Mr. Parsons, you wait here.

28
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:41,628
I'll take this one. He's not far.

29
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:44,167
So watch yourselves. I got his gun.

30
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,270
He ain't bleeding no more.

31
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:50,072
Yes, he is.

32
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:31,018
Where's Pope?

33
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:36,163
The intervals are 10 feet.
Be ready. He's here.

34
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:40,295
Remember, if you kill this son of a bitch,
you will not be paid.

35
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,734
Extremities only.

36
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:22,907
God damn it. Oh, hell.

37
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:27,643
Lord almighty.

38
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,748
What did he do to Pope?

39
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:35,589
Mister, who the hell is this man?

40
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:37,821
Get the horses. We have him now.

41
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:43,397
He must be part Indian or wolf.

42
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:47,727
- Eat a man like that.
- He didn't eat him. Go.

43
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:12,679
Go.

44
00:23:17,095 --> 00:23:19,825
Just what in the hell
do you think you're doing?

45
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:34,972
I guess it makes sense.

46
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:41,749
- Finished off by a young'un.
- I ain't no young'un.

47
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:45,081
And I don't care to hear you say
another goddamn thing.

48
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:49,285
Now, come on out of there
and put your hands out in front of you.

49
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:57,795
Come on.

50
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:08,870
You been shot.

51
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:11,877
Trying to steal somebody else's horse,
I reckon.

52
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:15,012
I'd say you need a new line of work, mister.

53
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:29,126
Nathaniel!

54
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:31,899
Nathaniel! Come on.

55
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:39,576
Come on, now.

56
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:03,827
Thank you, thank you. Thank you.

57
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:10,065
- Who is he?
- Horse thief.

58
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:13,075
But he's hurt.

59
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:15,771
I'll pay for the horse.

60
00:25:16,314 --> 00:25:17,906
You best rest yourself.

61
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:22,285
Pa'll be home after a while,
and he'll decide what to do with you.

62
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:36,562
No more tracks, Carver.

63
00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:39,502
The trail's gone cold up there.

64
00:26:17,776 --> 00:26:19,266
Your sister...

65
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:24,411
She don't take kindly to thieving.

66
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,883
There's plenty of time for that
when you grow up.

67
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:38,927
See that.

68
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:45,230
Yeah, he's still bleeding.

69
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:47,464
There's something else down here.

70
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:51,532
- Take a look.
- Yeah.

71
00:26:56,147 --> 00:26:57,341
What'd you see?

72
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:05,016
Charlotte.

73
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:13,155
We caught him trying to steal Red.

74
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:15,461
He's hurt. Shot.

75
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:18,692
Who are you, mister?

76
00:27:19,871 --> 00:27:23,967
I do some trapping a bit north of here.

77
00:27:24,342 --> 00:27:26,902
Must be quite a bit north of here.

78
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:30,541
Quite a bit.

79
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:36,111
I don't expect you shot yourself.

80
00:27:37,355 --> 00:27:39,323
No. No.

81
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:42,622
Somebody after your hides?

82
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:46,120
Fringing on your territory?

83
00:27:47,432 --> 00:27:48,831
I couldn't say.

84
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:54,767
You come down out of that pass
without a horse?

85
00:27:55,407 --> 00:28:00,470
Up here, a man without a horse
is generally a dead man.

86
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:04,079
That I can solve.

87
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:08,182
So I don't take kindly to a man
trying to steal mine.

88
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:12,312
Like I told your girl, I'll pay for the horse.

89
00:28:16,828 --> 00:28:20,855
It's only about six days' walk
from here to town,

90
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:22,989
as I recall.

91
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:27,768
I'll pay you twice what you paid for her.

92
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,737
If you can pay,

93
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:34,037
why don't you just walk yourself
down there?

94
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:03,672
I'd rather not.

95
00:29:12,717 --> 00:29:15,447
- Nothing there.
- Not a goddamn thing.

96
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:19,455
- I'll go down there and take a look.
- No.

97
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:22,554
We're done here. We'll follow the ridge.

98
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:26,996
That's 16 days. Seventeen out Mount Olive,

99
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:30,459
- at $1 a day.
- You'll get your money when we find him.

100
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:31,968
Not before.

101
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:34,870
What do you mean? You saw.

102
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,001
That trail ends down
at the end of that ravine.

103
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:40,340
'Cause he never went down the ravine.

104
00:29:40,645 --> 00:29:42,135
We follow the ridge.

105
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:20,044
Come here.

106
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:33,594
I'm Gideon.

107
00:30:47,745 --> 00:30:49,838
You don't talk much, do you, boy?

108
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:55,349
You know, it's not considered polite

109
00:30:58,156 --> 00:31:01,853
to shoot a man
who's sleeping in your house.

110
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,886
Well,

111
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:40,155
get on back to bed.

112
00:32:41,526 --> 00:32:42,993
Where is he?

113
00:32:43,494 --> 00:32:46,156
- Who the hell...
- I'm doing the asking here.

114
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:48,698
- Coffee and biscuits, woman.
- Now, lie to me

115
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:52,303
and I will fire this place with you
and yourn in it.

116
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:55,168
- Now where is he?
- Must have left at first light.

117
00:32:55,239 --> 00:32:58,037
We done got here at first light. Damn fool.

118
00:32:58,109 --> 00:33:01,101
- Were he able-bodied when he come here?
- No.

119
00:33:02,046 --> 00:33:04,674
- Did you give him supplies or a rifle?
- No.

120
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:08,147
- He had a pistol.
- Took that off of Pope after he killed him.

121
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,354
- You give him a horse?
- No.

122
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,488
Ain't no horse for that one.

123
00:33:15,026 --> 00:33:17,859
Mister, I don't know where you come from,

124
00:33:18,062 --> 00:33:21,031
but we helped a shot mongrel of a man,
and he's gone away in the night,

125
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:22,726
and that's all we know.

126
00:33:28,606 --> 00:33:30,335
You lying son of a bitch.

127
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:35,375
What did you sell him?
What did the devil get for his money?

128
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:46,145
Hayes.

129
00:33:47,425 --> 00:33:49,950
I ain't paying you to play with womenfolk.

130
00:34:21,192 --> 00:34:23,387
Tell me about the man who came here.

131
00:34:26,764 --> 00:34:28,459
If I think you're lying,

132
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:32,560
I'll kill your brother
and hand you over to Mr. Hayes.

133
00:34:35,673 --> 00:34:37,072
He was here,

134
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,739
and he left in the night.

135
00:34:41,946 --> 00:34:45,347
- Stole a mare, looks like.
- What about that gold?

136
00:34:46,284 --> 00:34:47,512
I don't know.

137
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:50,076
I don't know.

138
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:56,253
I took it.

139
00:34:57,695 --> 00:35:00,186
He was sleeping. I took it from his bag.

140
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:04,225
I only wanted a gun

141
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:06,702
to protect us.

142
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,938
Son, nobody can protect nobody
in this world.

143
00:35:21,018 --> 00:35:23,418
The sooner you realize that, the better.

144
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,507
Pope's horse stays.

145
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:50,069
You son of a bitch.

146
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:54,143
No wonder you don't talk much.

147
00:36:55,513 --> 00:36:56,980
Too busy thieving.

148
00:40:31,562 --> 00:40:33,257
How do you write "wife"?

149
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:36,695
Kid, that's W...

150
00:40:37,868 --> 00:40:41,201
H-O-R-E.

151
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:44,767
Don't much matter how you spell it,

152
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:49,602
a woman ain't gonna be yours
unless you're paying her for the night.

153
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:53,273
You pay her to be sweet to you, kid,
that's all.

154
00:40:53,384 --> 00:40:55,909
Don't never mix up money and love.

155
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:14,961
Toss the pistol.

156
00:41:28,085 --> 00:41:29,780
What do you want?

157
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:34,715
I'd have thought that it was obvious,
seeing as how I've been shooting at you.

158
00:41:37,461 --> 00:41:39,258
Keep them hands out.

159
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:44,598
Turn around.

160
00:41:51,375 --> 00:41:53,002
Why are you doing this?

161
00:41:56,947 --> 00:41:58,710
Seraphim Falls.

162
00:42:08,325 --> 00:42:11,658
Colonel Carver.

163
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:17,626
Turn around. I wanna see your face.

164
00:42:41,258 --> 00:42:44,557
- What?
- Double watches the rest of the night.

165
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:06,742
You'll be on him before long.
He was here today.

166
00:44:07,177 --> 00:44:10,669
Watch the sides.
Make sure he didn't break off and cover.

167
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:10,965
Jesus Christ.

168
00:45:15,112 --> 00:45:18,673
He's still breathing.
We got to get this thing off him.

169
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:31,793
Parsons, see about that horse.

170
00:46:09,466 --> 00:46:13,732
Well, now we got some discussing to do.
Right here and now.

171
00:46:13,837 --> 00:46:17,102
We ain't negotiating based on
tracking no killer like this.

172
00:46:17,474 --> 00:46:19,101
You're being well-paid.

173
00:46:20,744 --> 00:46:23,645
We're 18 days on a 30-day commission,

174
00:46:23,747 --> 00:46:27,148
- and two of us is already dead.
- Can't say I'm surprised.

175
00:46:27,551 --> 00:46:30,543
The man we're after
preys on the weak and unprepared.

176
00:46:31,321 --> 00:46:33,653
I'd advise you to take this as a warning.

177
00:46:33,724 --> 00:46:37,319
Well, what if we just decided
to take that as our walking papers?

178
00:46:40,998 --> 00:46:44,092
You are, of course,
free to do that, Mr. Hayes.

179
00:46:44,168 --> 00:46:48,434
You will, however, do it without
the assistance of my horse on which you sit.

180
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:50,769
Am I clear, gentlemen?

181
00:46:51,608 --> 00:46:52,836
We'll keep on.

182
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:56,668
But we want to split the pay
that's due them, instead.

183
00:46:59,249 --> 00:47:02,047
Done. Now we've got distance to cover.

184
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:05,714
If our man makes it to the low country,
we'll likely never see him again.

185
00:47:05,789 --> 00:47:08,257
Wouldn't catch me complaining about that.

186
00:48:37,681 --> 00:48:39,080
Morning, stranger.

187
00:48:41,818 --> 00:48:44,378
I didn't figure any transients this far up.

188
00:48:46,023 --> 00:48:48,014
I'm just passing through, is all.

189
00:48:48,492 --> 00:48:49,857
You need some whiskey?
We got some whiskey.

190
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:51,258
Shut up, Horace.

191
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:54,261
No, I can't say as I'm looking for whiskey,

192
00:48:55,299 --> 00:48:57,597
but I sure could use some food.

193
00:49:03,307 --> 00:49:06,208
Looks like you boys
have got other things on your mind.

194
00:49:07,644 --> 00:49:10,442
Would have been helpful
if you hadn't seen those.

195
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:17,450
Well, if you ain't planning on eating,
I'll just be getting on.

196
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:20,116
I'm afraid I can't let you do that.

197
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:23,883
You see, we is fugitives from the law.

198
00:49:24,328 --> 00:49:27,388
They catch us, they're gonna string us up.

199
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:29,591
Horace, if you don't get quiet,
I'm gonna hang you myself.

200
00:49:29,666 --> 00:49:31,600
It don't much matter to me.

201
00:49:32,736 --> 00:49:36,866
I'm just looking to be left alone.
Same as you.

202
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:41,875
So, I'll be on my way.

203
00:49:45,182 --> 00:49:47,480
You look powerful familiar, mister.

204
00:49:49,453 --> 00:49:50,784
I know you?

205
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:56,724
I doubt it.

206
00:50:04,634 --> 00:50:05,999
I'll be damned.

207
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:08,801
That's one of McClellan's boys
up at Antietam.

208
00:50:08,872 --> 00:50:10,533
Ain't you gonna kill him, huh?

209
00:50:11,141 --> 00:50:12,540
Waste of a bullet.

210
00:50:12,909 --> 00:50:16,208
He's so banged up and hungry,
he won't make it to town anyway.

211
00:50:16,279 --> 00:50:18,110
Lost both his sons

212
00:50:19,149 --> 00:50:21,811
in one day at that goddamn bridge.

213
00:50:22,486 --> 00:50:24,545
- I seen it myself.
- Yeah?

214
00:50:24,921 --> 00:50:26,616
But nothing touched him.

215
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:29,592
Not a scratch.

216
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:31,785
Not a splinter.

217
00:50:33,463 --> 00:50:35,795
They say he killed over 100 men
that day alone.

218
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:37,857
Him? Nah.

219
00:50:38,301 --> 00:50:41,429
Hey, you use some of that money
to get yourself some spectacles.

220
00:50:42,739 --> 00:50:45,970
Still, Virgil, the way you shot that teller,
I thought you'd be itching to do it again.

221
00:50:46,076 --> 00:50:48,840
I'm itching to get out of here. Get going.

222
00:50:48,912 --> 00:50:50,777
Goddamn right. Let's go.

223
00:50:51,948 --> 00:50:53,438
Don't ever go chasing after that man.

224
00:50:53,517 --> 00:50:56,042
If you don't shoot him,
I swear to Christ I will.

225
00:50:56,119 --> 00:50:58,349
We can't be letting no stranger,
whoever the hell you think he is,

226
00:50:58,422 --> 00:51:00,788
just walk into town
and tell them authorities where we gone.

227
00:51:00,857 --> 00:51:03,417
- Let's go. Come on.
- Take care of it myself.

228
00:51:06,029 --> 00:51:07,189
Horace!

229
00:51:08,298 --> 00:51:09,822
Horace, come on!

230
00:51:15,372 --> 00:51:18,068
Afraid I'm gonna have to ask you
to stop walking.

231
00:51:21,978 --> 00:51:23,707
Let me be, boy.

232
00:51:25,649 --> 00:51:28,083
Best just go on back up to your kin.

233
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:30,947
Mister, I never shot nobody
in the back before.

234
00:51:31,288 --> 00:51:33,620
So it's best you just turn around,

235
00:51:34,157 --> 00:51:36,990
- and you get what's coming to you.
- Boy,

236
00:51:38,228 --> 00:51:40,958
now you put that gun up and go on.

237
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:43,297
Turn around.

238
00:52:12,562 --> 00:52:14,189
You're a fool, boy.

239
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:19,061
I told you to let me pass on.

240
00:52:38,255 --> 00:52:39,244
Hey!

241
00:52:44,961 --> 00:52:46,986
There was three of 'em.

242
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:49,963
Two of 'em went on up,
one went down that way.

243
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:19,154
- Look familiar, gentlemen?
- Figure it's him that done it?

244
00:53:19,229 --> 00:53:20,218
'Course it's him.

245
00:53:20,297 --> 00:53:23,698
Who else would be dropping folks
like owl pellets out on these hills?

246
00:53:23,833 --> 00:53:26,802
If he's got himself another horse,
we won't catch him before sundown.

247
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:28,838
I reckon we ought to move
down valley, then.

248
00:53:28,905 --> 00:53:31,271
He won't be heading toward Carson City.

249
00:53:32,142 --> 00:53:34,633
Come on. Let's get off these cursed hills.

250
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,814
You two can go on without me.

251
00:53:39,649 --> 00:53:40,843
What?

252
00:53:42,152 --> 00:53:44,643
Those boys have been wanted
for six months.

253
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:47,554
He's worth 250 in Carson.

254
00:53:47,991 --> 00:53:50,721
That's a damned sight better
than what he's offering.

255
00:53:50,794 --> 00:53:52,921
And this boy don't require no chasing.

256
00:53:52,996 --> 00:53:55,396
- You can't just leave.
- The hell I can't.

257
00:53:55,832 --> 00:53:57,732
You would, too,
if you knew what was good for you.

258
00:53:57,801 --> 00:54:00,668
The posse's take is all yours
when the ride's done.

259
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:04,965
No less than 120 and you don't have to ride
with a stinking corpse, neither.

260
00:54:07,611 --> 00:54:08,703
All right.

261
00:54:14,651 --> 00:54:15,640
You sure?

262
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:19,684
You go on and get yourself killed. I'm done.

263
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:28,189
Okay.

264
00:54:48,885 --> 00:54:51,046
Let him earn that 250 the hard way.

265
00:54:51,221 --> 00:54:53,348
He ain't never going to make it
to town without a horse.

266
00:54:53,423 --> 00:54:56,051
I told you boys. Them horses are mine.

267
00:55:31,795 --> 00:55:34,923
We can water your mare.
She looks hard-ridden.

268
00:55:35,598 --> 00:55:38,726
Mercy to the beast is blessed
in the eyes of the Lord.

269
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:46,032
He sees your sin.

270
00:55:47,032 --> 00:55:57,032
