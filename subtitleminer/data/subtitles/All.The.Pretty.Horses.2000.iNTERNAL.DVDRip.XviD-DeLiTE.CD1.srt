00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,756
You ever think about dying?

2
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,231
Yeah. You?

3
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,908
Yeah. Some.

4
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,199
You think there's a heaven?

5
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,951
Yeah. Don't you?

6
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,113
I don't know.

7
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,798
Yeah, maybe.

8
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,828
Can you believe there's a heaven
if you don't believe in hell?

9
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,154
I guess you can believe
what you want to.

10
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,189
<i>This ranch has been in my family
as long as anyone can remember.</i>

11
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,673
<i>My granddaddy used to tell me
this was heaven on earth.</i>

12
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,360
<i>Just like his granddaddy
used to tell him.</i>

13
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,993
<i>Everything's changed now
since he died.</i>

14
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,791
Appreciate you lighting them candles.

15
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,919
It wasn't me. It was the lady.

16
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,229
My mother?

17
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,839
She was here?

18
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,637
She's left already?

19
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,268
<i>All I ever wanted was to live
out there like him...</i>

20
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,590
<i>...and work my own spread.</i>

21
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,353
<i>Can't imagine no better life.</i>

22
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,668
<i>I've come to find out Mama
aims to sell it.</i>

23
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,916
<i>Says the oil company would pay
three times what it's worth.</i>

24
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,390
<i>Mama lives in San Antonio now
with her new husband.</i>

25
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,588
<i>She wants to be in the live theatre.</i>

26
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,236
<i>As your granddaddy's only child...</i>

27
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,510
<i>...your mother inherits outright.</i>

28
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,073
It's her property.
She can do whatever she wants.

29
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,508
I don't have any say-so?

30
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,229
What about my father?

31
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,873
They're divorced.

32
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,233
You could talk to her.

33
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,989
You're a lawyer.

34
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,509
Well, I have talked to her.

35
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,433
It's a sorry piece of business,
but, son...

36
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,758
...not everybody thinks life
on a cattle ranch in Texas...

37
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,349
...is the second-best thing
to going to heaven.

38
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,830
She don't want to live
out there, that's all.

39
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,230
If it was a paying proposition,
that'd be one thing, but it ain't.

40
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,555
It could be.

41
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,598
I could run it.

42
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,031
It's his own damn fault.

43
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,153
Your father signed every
paper she set in front of him.

44
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,954
Never lifted a hand to save himself.

45
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,396
I begged him to get a lawyer.

46
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,555
Well...

47
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,671
I'm sorry to have no better news...

48
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,678
...but some things in this world
can't be helped.

49
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,396
I believe this is probably
one of them.

50
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,835
She went back to San Antonio.

51
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,348
Don't call her "she. "

52
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,993
Mama.

53
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,350
I thought the world of that old man.

54
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,510
Yeah.

55
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,358
Don't go crying on me now.

56
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,830
I ain't.

57
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,678
- Well, don't.
- I ain't.

58
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,555
- What do you think I should do?
- I don't think there's much to do.

59
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,557
- Will you talk to her?
- I can't.

60
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,113
You could talk to her.

61
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,276
Last conversation I had with her...

62
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:36,309
...was in San Diego, California,
in 1942.

63
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,638
It ain't her fault.

64
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,670
I ain't the same as I once was.

65
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,110
Like to think I am...

66
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,795
...but I ain't.

67
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,072
You are inside.

68
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,232
Inside you are.

69
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,953
<i>It's hard to watch people you came
from waste away before your eyes.</i>

70
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,557
<i>When the land is gone too...</i>

71
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,672
<i>...there's nothing to stand on
or stand for either.</i>

72
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,396
<i>When do y'all have to be out?</i>

73
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,910
Closing is the first of June.

74
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,271
You could wait till then.

75
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,599
What for?

76
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,637
Down in Mexico...

77
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,190
...they got ranches so big...

78
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,472
...you can't ride from one end
to the other in a week.

79
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,275
It ain't all fenced in
and sold off and played out.

80
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,072
Not down there.

81
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,792
You think they can't use
two more top hands?

82
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,270
ReaI cowboys, huh?

83
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,829
Just like the old-time waddies.

84
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,274
If I don't go, will you go anyways?

85
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,472
I'm already gone.

86
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,439
- Thank you for everything.
- Goodbye.

87
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,916
May God go with you.

88
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,752
Be carefuI.

89
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,715
Is that you, bud?

90
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,512
I hope so.

91
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,073
- You ready?
- Yeah.

92
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,271
- They suspect anything?
- No.

93
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,233
- Let's go.
- Hang on. Got to pile all this stuff.

94
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,237
- Yonder goes the light.
- Damn.

95
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,159
- Late for your own funeraI.
- He could be getting milk.

96
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,151
He could just be loading a shotgun.

97
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,831
Shut up. Lacey, there's been
somebody following us.

98
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,389
- Somebody on horseback?
- Yeah.

99
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,669
Come on.

100
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,554
Some kid.

101
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,910
That's a hell of a horse.

102
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,633
Ain't it, though?

103
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,912
You hunting us?

104
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,634
- I ain't hunting you.
- Why you following us?

105
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:42,037
I ain't. I'm going to Langtry.
I don't even know you.

106
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,356
- Where'd you get that horse?
- It's mine.

107
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,198
- How old are you?
- Sixteen.

108
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,470
- Lying sack of shit!
- You don't know.

109
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,030
I know you ain't no goddamn 16.

110
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,231
- What'd you do, run off?
- What if I did?

111
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,957
We could sell his horse in Mexico.

112
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,799
- You want to?
- I ain't digging no grave this time.

113
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,959
Your idea. I was the one that said
just leave him for the buzzards.

114
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,675
Call it.

115
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,989
Heads.

116
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,514
Damn.

117
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,713
Let me have your rifle.

118
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,233
It ain't fair.
You shot the last three.

119
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,829
You go on, then. You can owe me.

120
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,188
Hold his horse.
It might not be gun-broke.

121
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,116
Y'all ain't never shot nobody.

122
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,993
You could be a good somebody
to start with.

123
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,958
Y'all just funning.
I knowed it all along.

124
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,479
Who's hunting you?

125
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,230
Nobody.

126
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,829
They're hunting that horse,
though, right?

127
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,313
You ain't riding with us.
Get us in the jailhouse.

128
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,555
He belongs to me.

129
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,070
Son, I don't give a shit
who he belongs to.

130
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,834
But he damn sure don't belong to you.

131
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,314
Now, let's go, bud.

132
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,955
I thought he'd put up more
of a argument.

133
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,633
We ain't seen the last
of his skinny ass.

134
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,229
That's her, ain't it?
That's the goddamn Rio Grande.

135
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,754
Just think. Over yonder's Old Mexico.

136
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,236
You reckon you want to cross now?

137
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,837
Yeah. You?

138
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,789
Yeah.

139
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,479
Maybe we'd better rest
these horses up first.

140
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,154
All right.

141
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,673
Shit.

142
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,833
I got a uneasy feeling
about that son of a bitch.

143
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,633
I do too.

144
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,190
He ain't as green as he looks,
neither.

145
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:48,028
There won't nobody
be hunting me in Mexico.

146
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,356
That all depends on what you done.

147
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,074
- What's your name?
- Jimmy Blevins.

148
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,554
You got any grub?

149
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,029
No.

150
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,239
You got any money?

151
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,909
No.

152
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,832
You're just a deadhead.

153
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,832
Just tell me one thing.

154
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,069
What the hell would we want you
with us for?

155
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,312
Because I'm a American.

156
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,438
When did you eat last?

157
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,954
Other day.

158
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,437
Your name ain't Blivit, is it?

159
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,354
It's Blevins.

160
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,794
You know what a blivit is?

161
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,395
No. What?

162
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,034
Ten pounds of shit
in a five-pound sack.

163
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,876
Y'all ain't said y'all's names was.

164
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,796
I'm John Grady Cole.
This here's Lacey Rawlins.

165
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,158
We're from San Angelo.
Where you from?

166
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,272
Uvalde County.
Near the SabinaI River.

167
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,069
What made you light out for Mexico?

168
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,749
Same reason as you.

169
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,679
What reason is that?

170
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:06,990
Because they'd go bowlegged
and blind finding your ass down here.

171
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,315
Nobody's hunting me.

172
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,593
I told that son of a bitch
he wasn't whupping me again.

173
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,711
- Your daddy?
- No.

174
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,831
He never came back from the war.

175
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,439
Your stepdaddy.

176
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,996
I know what it's like
to get a beating.

177
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,148
You didn't shoot him?

178
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,590
I would've. And he knowed it too.

179
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,796
Suppose we trade that horse off
for one less likely get us shot.

180
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,560
- I ain't trading horses.
- We ain't no wet nurses.

181
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,830
- I can take care of myself.
- Sure.

182
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,157
Hell, you're a regular
old desperado, ain't you?

183
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,990
I reckon you got your own gun and all.

184
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,349
Yeah, I got a gun.

185
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,629
What kind of a gun?

186
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,390
-32-20 Colt.
- Bullshit.

187
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,471
That's a rifle cartridge.

188
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,635
Let's see it.

189
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,791
Where'd you get a gun like this?

190
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,228
At the getting place.

191
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,272
- You ever shot it?
- Yeah, I shot it.

192
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,590
- You hit anything?
- Anything you want.

193
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,028
Bullshit.

194
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,231
All right, let's go, outlaw. Come on.

195
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,472
You ready, Annie Oakley?

196
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,153
Waiting on you.

197
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,033
Goddamn.

198
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,555
Let me see it.

199
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,790
- Let me see it.
- We'd better get going.

200
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,549
- Come on, give it to me.
- You know what my wallet looks like.

201
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,353
Look at this shit.

202
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,471
She got anything to drink?

203
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,519
What is that?

204
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,273
- Cider.
- All right.

205
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,238
Let's have three of them.

206
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,439
How much is it?

207
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,868
It's like three cents.

208
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,230
Oh, let your old dad buy it.

209
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,279
He about dead-centred
your pocketbook, didn't he?

210
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,112
I want you to look at my
goddamn driver's license.

211
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,677
And my pooI hall card.

212
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,711
You won't need them down here.

213
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,639
Look at this shit.

214
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,791
Shot Betty Ward between the eyes.

215
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,118
What's she doing in there?
I didn't know you liked her.

216
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,436
What is this? Cactus juice?

217
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,868
I don't know.

218
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,915
- Got a little kick to it, though.
- I think it does.

219
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,511
Pretty doggone good.

220
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,991
Say it again. Say my name again.

221
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,349
Golly!

222
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,438
What am I doing leaving
my hat on the bed? It's not much.

223
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,835
You can't have no more cider.

224
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,153
Shit.

225
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,636
I'm drunker than shit.

226
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,432
Can you ride or not?

227
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,198
Hell, yeah, I can ride.

228
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,791
I was riding when I fell off.

229
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,309
I'm a regular buckaroo.

230
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,988
Certified damn bronc peeler.

231
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,953
Just leave him lay there.

232
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,630
Get on and quit assing around.
It's fixing to come a good one.

233
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,034
Come on.

234
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,598
I can't be out in this.

235
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,189
- Where do you think you'll go?
- Why can't you?

236
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,913
On account of the lightning.

237
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,839
Damn if you don't look
sober all of a sudden.

238
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,952
- Are you afraid of lightning?
- It runs in the family.

239
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,756
My grandpa, he was killed
in West Virginia in a mine bucket.

240
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,599
It run all the way down the hole
to get him, 180 feet.

241
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,351
A great-uncle on my mother's side...

242
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:27,315
...was killed off a horse. Horse's
hair wasn't singed, but it killed him.

243
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,755
I got a cousin not
four year older than me.

244
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,235
He was struck by lightning
coming back from his barn.

245
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,392
Melted the fillings in his teeth
and soldered his jaw shut.

246
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,909
He's gone completely dipshit.

247
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,309
I done been struck twice myself.

248
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,195
How come me be deaf in this one ear?

249
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,670
I'm born to death by fire, man.

250
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:51,679
You'd better get away from all metaI.
You don't know what it'd get you.

251
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,110
Your boot spurs, shirt buttons...

252
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,878
What do you intend to do?

253
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,308
Outride it.

254
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,516
You can't outride a thunderstorm.
What the hell is wrong with you?

255
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,233
It's the only chance I got.

256
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,589
I knowed it from the first time that
son of a bitch had a loose nut.

257
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,471
What the hell are you doing?!

258
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,159
Just sitting here.

259
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:33,310
If this rain hits hard, there'll be
a river come down like a train.

260
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,788
You thought about that?

261
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,629
You've never been struck by lightning.
You don't know what it's like.

262
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,876
You'll drown sitting there.

263
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,195
That's all right. I ain't never
been drowned before.

264
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,235
Well...

265
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,189
...I'll say no more.

266
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,992
Your horse is gone.

267
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,958
Yeah, I know. I done been on foot
looking around this morning.

268
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,432
Where'd you find that boot?

269
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,439
On the ground.

270
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,951
Well, what do you aim to do?

271
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,039
I don't know.

272
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,515
Let's get your ass up out of there.

273
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,470
Got a spare shirt in my saddlebag.
You put that on.

274
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:53,955
Appreciate it.

275
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,913
Rawlins will pitch a pure hissy
when he sees you.

276
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,314
I don't give a shit.

277
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,838
There's my damn pistoI.

278
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,268
- Shit.
- Hold on.

279
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,195
Keep riding. Good God almighty.

280
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,436
I ain't leaving untiI I get my stuff.

281
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,596
- My gun too.
- Listen at that.

282
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,837
Get us all shot for horse-stealing
don't mean a thing.

283
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,600
- It ain't stealing. It's mine.
- Shit-for-brains!

284
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,119
Hush. Both of you.

285
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,998
Get over here and sit down.

286
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,352
We're going to stick here...

287
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,270
...till about a hour before daylight.

288
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,758
Now, you got to play this
exactly like we say.

289
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,760
If that don't satisfy,
you tell us right now.

290
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,632
Yeah. Okay.

291
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,029
All right.

292
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,591
You go on and get some sleep.

293
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,798
And no fire tonight.

294
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,678
Every dumb thing I ever done
in my life...

295
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,672
...there was a decision I made
before that got me into it.

296
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,791
It was never the dumb thing.

297
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,189
It was always some choice I'd
made before. You understand?

298
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,199
Yeah, I think so.

299
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,593
Meaning what?

300
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,552
Meaning this is it.

301
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:44,949
This is our last chance. Won't be
no other time, I guarantee it.

302
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,151
- Meaning just leave him?
- Yes, sir.

303
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,589
What if it was you?

304
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,155
I wouldn't leave you, or you me.

305
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,918
You realize the fix he's in?

306
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:58,115
I realize it. It's the fix
he's put himself in.

307
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,679
I can't do it.

308
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,231
Well, if you can't, you can't.

309
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,599
I guess I knew what you'd say anyways.

310
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,195
Oh, no. Damn it.

311
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,319
That little son of a bitch.

312
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,230
Hold up, hold up. Let's listen.

313
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,596
You little son of a bitch.

314
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,153
- Boys, they're coming.
- Cars or horses?

315
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,113
Horses. And there ain't no way
y'all can keep up.

316
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:27,108
I'll take the road. They'll follow
the dust, since they're hunting me.

317
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,959
Get in the woods.
I'll see y'all down the road.

318
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,469
Let's get off this damn road.

319
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,433
You think they caught him?

320
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,548
I don't know.

321
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,360
I'll say one thing for him anyways.

322
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,988
What's that?

323
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:06,479
Son of a bitch wouldn't stand still
for nobody hijacking his horse.

324
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,119
You got your boots on?

325
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,311
- Yeah.
- All right.

326
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,671
You reckon they're friendly?

327
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,831
Shoot, I hope so.

328
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,993
Where are you going?

329
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,438
We're just passing through.

330
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,358
We're looking for work.

331
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,476
Oh, yeah?

332
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,716
We might have some work for you.

333
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,519
He said maybe.

334
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,155
Can we come with you?

335
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,709
Yes, of course.

336
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,790
Good.

337
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,710
Go that way.

338
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,550
Over there?

339
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,196
Did you see that little darling?

340
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,232
Watch it. Bring him over here.

341
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,794
Get in there.

342
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,434
How long you reckon
you'd like to stay here?

343
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,551
About a hundred years.

344
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,552
Now go to sleep.

345
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,874
There's Don Hector Rocha y VillareaI.

346
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,312
Owns this whole shebang.

347
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,438
One of the last great ranches
in Mexico.

348
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,916
27,000 acres.

349
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:49,078
Flies his own plane
to Mexico City every week.

350
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,910
ManueI said this ranch been
in this family 170 years.

351
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,676
You reckon that was his daughter?

352
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,838
Yeah, I guess it was.

353
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,111
Let me go get my boots on.

354
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,359
Looks like there's
about 12 or 13 of them.

355
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,709
I make it 16.

356
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:49,472
Armando said the old man's got
like 400 mustangs up on that mesa.

357
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,715
Damn.

358
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:57,512
You think you and me can break
all 16 of them in four days?

359
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,878
- Why four days?
- You think we could do it?

360
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,958
You'd be about a wore-out sumbuck,
I'll tell you that.

361
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,633
I'll have a look at them.
Go talk to Armando.

362
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,913
How you doing?

363
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,553
I'm all right.

364
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,594
If we mess this up, bud, it's gonna be
a long ride back to Texas.

365
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,109
Give it some slack.

366
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,153
That's it. That's it. Whoa, boy.

367
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,756
I'll put a saddle on you right now.

368
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,669
Your jackets.

369
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,753
You tired?

370
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,760
The horse is arriving, get ready.

371
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,279
Don't delay!

372
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,712
Hector de la Rocha y VillareaI.

373
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,989
John Grady Cole.

374
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,428
Glad to meet you.

375
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:04,713
Alfonsa, you look like
an Impressionist painting.

376
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,674
<i>Armando says you know
a lot about horses.</i>

377
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,677
I've been around them some.

378
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,510
Do you know what a criollo is?

379
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:19,512
Yes, sir. It's a Argentine horse.

380
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,199
You're from Texas?

381
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,634
Yes, sir.

382
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,753
San Angelo.

383
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,273
Why are you here?

384
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,709
I just wanted to see the country,
I reckon. Or we did.

385
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,031
- You and your friend.
- Yes, sir.

386
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,638
But you are the leader.

387
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:44,276
We don't have no leaders.
No, we're just buddies.

388
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,114
Of course.

389
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:54,194
I recently purchased a thoroughbred
stallion of excellent blood.

390
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,679
- You gonna raise racehorses?
- No. Quarter horses.

391
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:02,835
I'm thinking of breeding my stallion
with my mesteno mares.

392
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,599
What's your opinion on that?

393
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,877
Well, I've known it done.

394
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,159
There's been good cow horses
sired out of thoroughbreds.

395
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,271
Of what importance is the mare?

396
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,552
Same as the sire. In my opinion.

397
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,473
Most breeders place more confidence
in the stallion.

398
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,795
Yes, sir, they do.

399
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,438
But I agree with you.

400
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,194
And you rode all the way here
from Texas?

401
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:35,829
Yes, sir.

402
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,110
- You and your friend?
- Yes, sir.

403
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,552
Just the two of you.

404
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,635
Yes, sir.

405
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,919
Just me and him.

406
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:59,953
Well, Mr. Cole, would you like
to see some horses?

407
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:01,876
Yes, sir.

408
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:08,637
- It ain't like you was going away.
- No. We'd still be working together.

409
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,230
It's a good opportunity for you.

410
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,352
Hell, I'd do it.

411
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,720
They told me to come bunk in here.

412
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:48,030
I was going to put my horse
in one of these stalls.

413
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,514
Can I put my horse in this stall?

414
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,791
Well, I guess we can talk later.

415
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,715
That's your mare.

416
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,959
Look at the eye on her.

417
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,593
Bring this one here.

418
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:03,357
She's not as big as the other one,
but that's your mare.

419
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,192
Do you like this one?

420
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,429
She's a beauty.

421
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:58,313
Looks like some of them
got their hats on, bud.

422
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:13,794
I figure you just must be ready to cry
yourself to sleep every night.

423
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:18,312
She's probably used to dating guys got
their own airplanes, let alone cars.

424
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,874
You're probably right.

425
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,076
I'm glad to hear you say it.

426
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:24,350
It don't change nothing though.

427
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,671
My name's John Grady Cole.

428
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,672
My name is Alejandra.

429
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,429
I know.

430
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,117
I hoped that you would come.

431
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:00,713
I come because I thought
you'd be here.

432
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,508
I know.

433
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:27,791
My granddaddy lived
his whole life on that ranch.

434
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:30,276
Seventy-four years.

435
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:33,799
Seem there could hardly be one
without the other.

436
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,274
I guess...

437
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:42,309
...the country lasts forever,
and people ain't but for a while.

438
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,237
And how will you live now?

439
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,678
Where will your home be?

440
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:09,875
What's wrong?

441
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,632
I dreamed about you last night.

442
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:25,518
What did you dream about?

443
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:27,678
Someday I may tell you.

444
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:29,919
But not tonight.

445
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,318
Do I have something in my nose?

446
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:47,869
No. I have something in my nose.

447
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:02,874
Do you like him?

448
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:04,479
A hell of a horse.

449
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,472
I want to ride him.

450
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:25,989
What?

451
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,638
I want to ride him.

452
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:30,875
When?

453
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:32,355
Now.

454
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:35,350
- I want to now.
- He don't have a saddle.

455
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:36,549
I know.

456
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:43,950
I don't think the patron would want me
to give him to you without a saddle.

457
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,758
Your father.

458
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:54,789
Get down.

459
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,831
- Are you sure about this?
- Yes!

460
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:58,349
Hurry.

461
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:06,592
Well, what do you aim to do
with your horse?

462
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,075
I want you to take him
back to the barn.

463
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,038
Somebody's gonna see me.

464
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:38,878
Fixing to get me in trouble.

465
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,952
You are in trouble.

466
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,269
I am Senorita Alfonsa.

467
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:18,637
I'm John Grady Cole.

468
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,070
I'm happy that you have come.

469
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:36,669
Alejandra will be in Mexico City
with her mother for two weeks.

470
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,235
Then she'll be here for the summer.

471
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,879
Alejandra and I disagree strongly.

472
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:46,914
In fact, I...

473
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,796
She's so much like me
at that age that I-

474
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:55,516
I seem, at times, to be struggling
with my own past self.

475
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:02,109
So you see, I cannot help but be
sympathetic to Alejandra.

476
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,669
But I won't have her unhappy.

477
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,756
I won't have her spoken ill of...

478
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,871
...or gossiped about.

479
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:14,476
I know what that is.

480
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,310
It is not proper for you to be seen
riding in campo together...

481
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:20,437
...without supervision.

482
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:26,753
I considered whether to speak
to my niece about it, but I...

483
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,997
I've decided not.

484
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,158
What do you want me to do?

485
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:36,870
I want you to be considerate
of a young girI's reputation.

486
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,513
I never meant not to be.

487
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:40,193
I believe you.

488
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,074
But you see...

489
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:46,910
...this is another country.

490
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:52,880
Here, a woman's reputation
is all she has.

491
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:55,198
There's no forgiveness...

492
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:56,788
...for women.

493
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:02,119
A man may lose his honour and regain
it again, but a woman cannot.

494
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:06,959
I guess I'd have to say
that don't seem right.

495
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:10,796
It's not a matter of right.

496
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:15,198
It's a matter of who must say.

497
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:19,359
And in this matter, I get to say.

498
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:48,994
What is it?

499
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:56,396
You're going to wake Esteban.

500
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,793
Then invite me in.

501
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:09,792
What did she say to you? My aunt?

502
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:12,315
You want to sit down?

503
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:14,389
Go on.

504
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:20,952
What did she say to you?

505
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:27,035
- Didn't she tell you what she said?
- Of course she did.

506
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:29,548
What did she say?

507
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:36,480
She said she didn't want me
being seen with you in the campo.

508
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:40,319
And you agreed?

509
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,950
- You are afraid of her.
- No.

510
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,156
Just like everyone else.

511
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:52,553
It ain't like that.

512
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,834
I hate the way she treats me.

513
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:03,712
I thought you were my friend.

514
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:16,159
You tell me what you want me to do.

515
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:20,317
I'll do anything you say.

516
00:51:21,317 --> 00:51:31,317
