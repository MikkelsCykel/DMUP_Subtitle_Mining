1
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,556
Usurer!

2
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,831
Usurer!

3
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,159
"If a man is righteous,
and does what is lawful and right,

4
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,028
"if he has not exacted usury
nor taken any increase

5
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,237
"but has withdrawn his hand
from all iniquity

6
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:47,233
"and executed true judgment
between men and men,

7
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,675
"if he has walked in my statutes

8
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,709
"and kept my judgment faithfully,
then he is just and he shall surely live.

9
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,870
"But if he has exacted usury
and taken increase,

10
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,712
"shall he then live?

11
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,918
"No, he shall not live. If he has
done any of these abominations... "

12
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,197
"... he shall surely die, says the Lord. "

13
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,910
And yet you live
by theft and robbery...

14
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,877
Antonio.

15
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,628
Antonio.

16
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,153
Bassanio.

17
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,675
Wind's coming back, sir.

18
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,278
Signior Lorenzo.

19
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,953
Jessica.

20
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,632
In truth,
I know not why I am so sad.

21
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,595
It wearies me. You say it wearies you.

22
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,752
And such a want-wit sadness makes of me
that I have much ado than know myself.

23
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,400
Your mind is tossing on the ocean.

24
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:53,075
Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,

25
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,278
the better part of my affection
would be with my hopes abroad.

26
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,269
I should be still plucking the grass
to know where sits the wind,

27
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,432
peering in maps
for ports and piers and roads.

28
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,752
And every object that might make me fear
misfortune to my ventures

29
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,990
out of doubt would make me sad.

30
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,594
My wind, cooling my broth,

31
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,434
would blow me to a fever if I thought what
harm a wind too great might do at sea.

32
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,512
Believe me, no.

33
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,672
Why, then you're in love.

34
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,317
Fie, fie, fie!

35
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,749
Not in love either?

36
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,990
Then let us say you are sad

37
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,389
because you are not merry.

38
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,436
Here comes my lord Bassanio.

39
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:49,519
- Good morrow, my good lord.
- Good signiors. When shall we laugh?

40
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,910
We shall make our leisures
to fit in with yours.

41
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,516
- Bassanio.
- Signior.

42
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,669
My lord Bassanio, since you have found
Antonio, we too will leave you.

43
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,553
You look not well, Signior Antonio.

44
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,353
You have too much respect
upon the world.

45
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,714
They lose it that do buy it with much care.

46
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,190
I hold the world but
as the world, Gratiano -

47
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:24,435
a stage where every man
must play his part, and mine a sad one.

48
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,350
Come, good Lorenzo.

49
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,716
Fare thee well awhile.
I'll end my exhortation after dinner.

50
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,517
Fare thee well.

51
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,000
Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing,

52
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,275
more than any man in all of Venice.

53
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,273
Well?

54
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,952
Tell me now...

55
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,914
that which today
you promised to tell me of.

56
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:29,199
'Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,
how much I have disabled mine estate,

57
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,909
but my chief care is to come
squarely out of the great debts

58
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,757
wherein my youth, something too prodigal,

59
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,830
has left me pledged.

60
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:47,631
To you, Antonio,
I owe the most in money and in love,

61
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:52,555
and from your love I have a warranty
to unburden all my plots and purposes

62
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,155
how to get clear of all the debts I owe.

63
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,755
Pray, good Bassanio, let me know it.

64
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:11,273
And, if it stand, as you yourself still do,
within the eye of honour,

65
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,753
be assured my purse, my person,
my extremest means

66
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,195
lie all unlocked to your occasion.

67
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,598
In Belmont is a lady richly left -

68
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:31,673
and she is fair, and fairer than that word -

69
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,360
of wondrous virtues.

70
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,036
Sometimes, from her eyes
I did receive fair...

71
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,712
speechless messages.

72
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:49,311
Her name is Portia, no less a beauty
than Cato's daughter, Brutus' Portia.

73
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,392
Nor is the wide world
ignorant of her worth,

74
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,519
for the four winds blow in from every coast
renowned suitors.

75
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,556
O my Antonio,

76
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:07,315
had I but the means
to hold a rival place with one of them

77
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,955
then I should questionless be fortunate.

78
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,674
Thou knowest my fortunes are at sea.

79
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:29,435
Neither have I money nor commodity
to raise a present sum.

80
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,395
Therefore, go forth.

81
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,029
Try what my credit can in Venice do.

82
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,716
It shall be racked, even to the uttermost,
to furnish you to Belmont,

83
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,712
and fair Portia.

84
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,959
I swear to you, Nerissa,

85
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,953
- I am more weary of this great world.
- You would be, sweet madam,

86
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:22,318
if your miseries were as plentiful
as your good fortunes are.

87
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,356
And yet, from what I see,

88
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:28,752
they are as sick that have it in excess
as those that starve with nothing.

89
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:32,116
If doing were as easy
as knowing what were good to do,

90
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,156
chapels had been churches,

91
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,073
and poor men's cottages princes' palaces.

92
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:42,991
But this reasoning is
not in the way to choose me a husband.

93
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,355
O me, the word "choose"!

94
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,228
I may neither choose who I would
nor refuse who I dislike.

95
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:53,279
So is the will of a living daughter
ruled by a dead father.

96
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,958
Is it not hard, Nerissa,
that I cannot choose one nor refuse none?

97
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,872
Your father was always virtuous,

98
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:12,875
and holy men, at their death,
have good inspirations.

99
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,518
Therefore the lottery, that he devised

100
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,672
in these three chests
of gold and silver and lead,

101
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,149
so that who chooses his meaning
chooses you,

102
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:26,473
will no doubt only be guessed, rightly,
by someone who you shall rightly love.

103
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,834
Right.

104
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,960
What warmth is there
in your affection

105
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,191
towards any of these princely suitors
that are already come?

106
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:38,352
Pray name them, and
as you name them I will describe them,

107
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,955
and, according
to my description, level at my affection.

108
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,794
How say you of the French lord,
Monsieur Le Bon?

109
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,030
Oh, God.

110
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,317
God made him,
and therefore let him pass for a man.

111
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,914
I know it is a sin to be a mocker, but he...!

112
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,117
What say you to Falconbridge,
the young baron of England?

113
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:01,113
How oddly he's suited!

114
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,430
And the Duke of Saxony's nephew?

115
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,670
Very vilely in the morning
when he is sober,

116
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,672
and most vilely in the afternoon
when he is drunk.

117
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,398
O Nerissa!

118
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,311
Wait! Wait.

119
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:19,029
If he should offer to choose,
and choose the right casket,

120
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:24,513
you should refuse to perform your father's
will if you should refuse to accept him.

121
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,398
Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee,

122
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,029
set a deep glass of Rhenish wine
on the contrary casket.

123
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,796
I will do anything, Nerissa,
ere I will be married to a sponge.

124
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,991
Three thousand ducats.

125
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,638
Well.

126
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,154
Ay, sir, for three months.

127
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,629
For three months?

128
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,430
- Well...
- For which, as I told you,

129
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,397
Antonio shall be bound.

130
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,436
Antonio shall be bound?

131
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,676
Well...

132
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,194
May you help me? Will you pleasure me?

133
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,556
Should I know your answer?

134
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:23,236
Three thousand ducats for three months,

135
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,550
and Antonio bound.

136
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,596
Your answer to that.

137
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,356
Antonio is a good man.

138
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,112
Have you heard any imputation
to the contrary?

139
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:38,352
No. No, no, no, no. My meaning
in saying that he is a good man

140
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:43,389
is to have you understand
that he is of good credit.

141
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,436
Yet his means are in question.

142
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,237
He hath a ship bound for Tripolis,
another to the Indies.

143
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:55,677
I understand moreover, upon the Rialto,
he hath a third ship at Mexico,

144
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,716
a fourth for England,

145
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,952
and other ventures
he hath squandered abroad.

146
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,118
But ships are but boards,

147
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,634
sailors are but men,

148
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,280
there be land rats and water rats,

149
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,954
water thieves and land thieves.

150
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,836
I mean pirates.

151
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,510
Then there is the peril of waters,
winds and rocks.

152
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,354
The man is, notwithstanding,
of good credit.

153
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,792
Three thousand ducats.

154
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,230
I think I may take his bond.

155
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:38,077
- Be assured you may.
- May I speak with Antonio?

156
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,310
If it please you, dine with us.

157
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,356
Yes, to smell pork,

158
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:46,797
to eat of the habitation which your prophet
the Nazarite conjured the devil into.

159
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,793
I will buy with you, sell with you, walk
with you, talk with you, and so following,

160
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,474
but I will not eat with you,
nor drink with you,

161
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,516
nor pray with you.

162
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,556
Who is he comes here?

163
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,517
This is Signior Antonio. Antonio!

164
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,117
Antonio.

165
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:11,152
How like a fawning publican he looks.

166
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,315
Shylock! Shylock, do you hear?

167
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,192
I am debating of my present store,

168
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:22,637
and by the near guess of my memory,
I cannot instantly raise up the gross

169
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,756
of full three thousand ducats.

170
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:30,392
But Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe,
will furnish me.

171
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,552
Benjamin. Go, seek out Tubal.

172
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,069
But soft, how many months?

173
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,038
Rest you fair, good signior.

174
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,749
Your worship was the last man
in our mouths.

175
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:49,355
- Is he possessed how much you would?
- Ay, ay, three thousand ducats.

176
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,396
And for three months.

177
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,233
Ah, I forgot. Three months, you told me so.

178
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:01,549
But soft, erm... methought you said
you neither lend nor borrow with interest.

179
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:06,070
- I do never use it.
- Well.

180
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,232
Three thousand ducats,
'tis a good round sum.

181
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,312
Launcelot.

182
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,236
The rates.

183
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,752
Three months... from twelve.

184
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,076
Let me see the rate.

185
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,836
Well, Shylock,

186
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,396
shall we be beholden to you?

187
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,630
Signior Antonio...

188
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,996
many a time, and oft in the Rialto,

189
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,392
you have reviled me
about my moneys and my usances.

190
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,871
Still, I have borne it with a patient shrug,

191
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,872
for sufferance is the badge of all our tribe.

192
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,912
You call me misbeliever,

193
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,677
cut-throat dog,

194
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,309
and spit upon my Jewish gaberdine.

195
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,995
And all for use of that which is my own.

196
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:36,757
Well, it now appears you need my help.

197
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:42,437
You come to me and you say,
"Shylock, we would have money. "

198
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:47,719
You say so. You, that did void
your rheum upon my beard

199
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:52,510
and kick me as you spurn a stranger cur
over your threshold.

200
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,512
Money is your suit.
What should I say to you?

201
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,476
Should I not say, "Hath a dog money?

202
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:06,555
"Is it possible a cur can lend
three thousand ducats?"

203
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,551
Or shall I bend low

204
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,395
and, in a slavish voice, with bated breath
and whispering humbleness say this -

205
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,597
"Fair sir, you spat on me
on Wednesday last,

206
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:20,355
"you spurned me such a day,
another time you called me dog.

207
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,557
"For these courtesies,
I'll lend you thus much moneys. "

208
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:27,474
I'm as like to call you so again,
to spit on you again, to spurn you too.

209
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,597
If you would lend this money,
lend it not unto your friends.

210
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:34,275
For when did friendship take
a breed for barren metal from his friends?

211
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,635
Lend it rather to your enemy who,
if he break,

212
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,915
you may with better face exact the penalty.

213
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,959
Why, look how you storm.
I would be friends with you

214
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,474
and have your love.

215
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:50,634
Forget the stains
that you have shamed me with.

216
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:58,158
Supply your present wants, and take not
a drop of interest for my moneys...

217
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,754
...and you'll not hear me.

218
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,274
This is kind I offer.

219
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,873
- This is kindness.
- No...

220
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,157
This kindness I will show.

221
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:17,191
Go with me to a notary

222
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,636
and seal me there your single bond.

223
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,029
And in a merry sport,

224
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,157
if you repay me not on such a day

225
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,597
in such a place, such a sum or sums
as are expressed in the condition,

226
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:34,229
let the forfeit be nominated...

227
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,598
for an equal pound of your fair flesh

228
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:44,352
to be cut off and taken

229
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:48,069
in what part of your body pleaseth me.

230
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,715
Content, i'faith.

231
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,190
I'll seal to such a bond,

232
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,158
and say there is much kindness in the Jew.

233
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,988
You shall not seal such a bond for me.
I'd rather live in my necessity.

234
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,230
Why, fear not, man.

235
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,276
I will not forfeit it.

236
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,750
Within these two months,
that's a month before this bond expires,

237
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,879
I do expect return of thrice three times
the value of this bond.

238
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,598
O father Abraham,
what these Christians are,

239
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:33,673
whose own hard dealings teaches them
suspect the thoughts of others.

240
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,957
I pray you, tell me this.

241
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:42,273
If he should break his day, what should
I gain by the exaction of the forfeiture?

242
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:46,876
A pound of a man's flesh taken from a man
is not so estimable,

243
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,598
profitable neither,

244
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,558
as flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats.

245
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:59,351
I say, to buy his favour,
I extend this friendship.

246
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,398
If he will take it, so. If not, adieu.

247
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,552
And, for my love, I pray you, wrong me not.

248
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,992
Shylock...

249
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,916
I will seal unto this bond.

250
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,714
Dislike me not for my complexion,

251
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:36,749
the shadowed livery of the burnished sun,
to whom I am a neighbour and near bred.

252
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,629
Yallah! Yallah!

253
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,154
Bring me the fairest creature
northward born,

254
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:46,357
where the sun's fire
scarce thaws the icicles,

255
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,000
and let us make incision for your love

256
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:52,914
to prove whose blood is reddest,
his or mine.

257
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,831
I tell thee,

258
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:59,311
lady, this aspect of mine
hath feared the valiant.

259
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:04,679
Yea, by my love I swear, the most regarded
virgins of our clime have loved it too.

260
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:12,109
I would not change this hue, except
to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.

261
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:19,389
In terms of choice, I am not solely led
by nice direction of a maiden's eyes.

262
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:24,156
Instead, the lottery of my destiny bars me
the right of voluntary choosing.

263
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,789
But if my father had not restrained me,

264
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,478
and hedged me by his wit
to yield myself as wife

265
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,949
to him who wins me
by that means I told you,

266
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,716
yourself, renowned prince,

267
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:43,510
then stood as fair as... any comer
I have looked on yet for my affection.

268
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,831
Even for that, I thank you.

269
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,830
Therefore, I pray you, lead me
to the caskets to try my fortune.

270
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,399
Yes?

271
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:11,029
I pray you, Leonardo, these
things being bought and orderly bestowed,

272
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,875
return in haste, for I do feast tonight
my best esteemed acquaintance.

273
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:20,550
Let supper be ready
at the latest by nine o'clock.

274
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,954
See that these letters are delivered.

275
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,918
And put the livery to the making.

276
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:42,920
Certainly my conscience would forbid me
to run from this Jew, my master.

277
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,592
Ho!

278
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,552
I pray you, which way to the master Jew's?

279
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,393
Do you not know me, Father?

280
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,596
Lord, how art thou changed!

281
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:01,039
How dost thou and thy master agree?
I brought him a present.

282
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,436
Famished in his service, Father.
I'm glad you've come.

283
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,149
Give your present to one master Bassanio,

284
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:15,392
who indeed gives rare new liveries.

285
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,152
Si.

286
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,118
Bassanio!

287
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,118
Bassanio!

288
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,354
- Gratiano.
- I have a suit to you.

289
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,637
- You have obtained it.
- You must not deny me -

290
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,870
I must go with you to Belmont.

291
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:43,000
Why, then you must. But hear thee, you are
too wild, too rude, too bold of voice,

292
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:48,359
things that become you happily enough
and in such eyes as ours appears not false.

293
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:54,709
But where you are not known, why,
there they show something too... liberal.

294
00:26:54,800 --> 00:27:00,591
Pray you, take pain to dilute with some
cold drops of modesty your skipping spirit,

295
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:05,071
lest through your wild behaviour
I be misconstrued in the place I go

296
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,116
and lose my hopes.

297
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,634
Signior Bassanio, hear me.

298
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:16,114
If I do not put on a sober habit, talk with
respect, and swear but now and then,

299
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,317
look demurely,
nay more, while grace is saying,

300
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,472
hood mine eyes thus with my hat

301
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,552
and sigh and say, "Amen,"
never trust me more.

302
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,473
Well, we shall see your bearing.

303
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,876
Oof!

304
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,716
Nay, but I bar tonight.

305
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,273
You shall not gauge me
by what we do tonight.

306
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,989
God bless your worship.

307
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,718
Signior Bassanio.

308
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,518
Many thanks.

309
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,750
Would you something from me?

310
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:58,515
- Here is my son, sir, a poor boy.
- Not a poor boy, sir,

311
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,114
but the rich Jew's man that would, sir,

312
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,116
as my father shall specify.

313
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,954
He hath a great infection, sir,
as one would say, to serve.

314
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,871
Indeed, sir. The short and the long is,

315
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:14,317
I serve the Jew, and have a desire,
as my father shall specify.

316
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:25,151
To be brief, the very truth is, as my father,
being an old man, shall fruitify unto you...

317
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:28,676
I have here a dish of doves
I would bestow upon your worship.

318
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,113
And my suit is...

319
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,476
In very brief,
the suit is impertinent to myself,

320
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,074
as your worship shall know
by this honest old man.

321
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:40,039
And, though I say it, though old man,
yet poor man, my father.

322
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,269
One speak for both. What would you?

323
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:50,429
- Serve you, sir.
- That is the very defect of the matter, sir.

324
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,590
You have obtained your suit,

325
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:55,752
if it be preferment
to leave a rich Jew's service

326
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,274
to become the follower
of so poor a gentleman.

327
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:02,831
The old proverb is very well parted
between my master Shylock and you, sir.

328
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:06,196
You have the grace of God, sir,
and he has enough.

329
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:13,117
You speak it well. Give him a livery more
guarded than his fellows'. See it done.

330
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,154
I'm sorry you will leave my father so.

331
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:51,916
Our house is hell, and you, a merry devil,
did rob it of some taste of tediousness.

332
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,759
And Launcelot, soon at supper
shall you see Lorenzo,

333
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,070
who is thy new master's guest.

334
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,116
Give him this letter.

335
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,916
Do it secretly.

336
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,952
And so farewell.

337
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:13,476
I would not have my father
see me talk with thee.

338
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,596
Adieu.

339
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:25,831
Tears exhibit my tongue.
Most beautiful pagan, most sweet Jew.

340
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:37,795
O Lorenzo, if thou keep promise,
I shall end this strife,

341
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,633
becoming Christian and your loving wife.

342
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,033
Jessica?

343
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,878
Well.

344
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:01,552
You will see, your eyes will be the judge,

345
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:04,552
the difference of old Shylock and Bassanio.

346
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:10,717
You will not gourmandise with him,
as you have done with me,

347
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:14,315
nor sleep and snore and wear apparel out.

348
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,798
Not with him.

349
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,758
- Jessica, I say!
- Why, Jessica.

350
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,796
Who bids you call?

351
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:25,713
I do not bid you call.

352
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:29,793
Your worship was used to say
I could do nothing without bidding.

353
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,836
Oh.

354
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,672
Call you?

355
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:38,477
- What's your will?
- I am bid forth to supper, Jessica.

356
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,516
There are my keys.

357
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,596
Wherefore should I go?

358
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,236
I am not bid for love.

359
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,396
Oh, they flatter me.

360
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,590
Yet I will go and feed
upon the prodigal Christian.

361
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:06,070
Jessica, my girl, look to my house.

362
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,634
Oh, I am right loath to go.

363
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:19,672
There is some ill a-brewing
towards my rest,

364
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:26,833
for I did dream of money bags tonight.

365
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,593
I beseech you, sir, go.

366
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,716
My young master expects your reproach.

367
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,997
And so do I his.

368
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,155
And they have conspired together.

369
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,990
I will not say you shall see a masque,

370
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:46,550
but if you do, it was not for nothing
that my nose fell a-bleeding

371
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,996
on Black Monday last
at six o'clock in the morning.

372
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,275
What, are there masques?

373
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:57,073
Hear you me, Jessica,

374
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:00,516
clamber not you up to the casements then,

375
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,319
nor thrust your head into the public street

376
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:06,949
to gaze on Christian fools
with varnished faces.

377
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:13,079
Let not the sound of shallow foppery
enter my sober house.

378
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:20,350
Oh, by Jacob's staff, I swear I have
no mind of feasting forth tonight.

379
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,828
But I will go.

380
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:30,277
Go you before, sirrah. Say I will come.

381
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,316
I will go before, sir.

382
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:37,318
Mistress, look out the window for all this.

383
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,995
There will come a Christian boy
will be worth a Jewess' eye.

384
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:47,557
What says that fool
of Hagar's offspring, ha?

385
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:54,438
His words were, "Farewell, mistress. "
Nothing else.

386
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,354
The fool is kind enough

387
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,556
but a huge feeder.

388
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,633
Snail-slow in profit,
and he sleeps by day more than a tomcat.

389
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,792
Therefore, I part with him.

390
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:21,030
Well, Jessica, go in.
Perhaps I will return immediately.

391
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,676
Do as I bid you.

392
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:46,754
Farewell.
And if my fortune be not crost,

393
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,479
I have a father, you a daughter, lost.

394
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,555
How do I know if I do choose the right?

395
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:04,234
The one of them
contains my picture, Prince.

396
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,073
If you choose that, then I am yours withal.

397
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,594
Some god direct my judgment!

398
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,672
Let me see.

399
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:23,436
"Who chooseth me
must give and hazard all he hath. "

400
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:28,235
- Hmm...
- Must give? For what?

401
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,754
For lead? Hazard for lead?

402
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,472
This casket, my friends, threatens.

403
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:39,838
Men who hazard all
do it in hope of fair advantages.

404
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:43,592
A golden mind stoops not
to shows of dross, eh?

405
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,397
I'll then nor give nor hazard
aught for lead, ah? Mm-mm.

406
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:58,038
What says the silver with her virgin hue?

407
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,075
"Who chooseth me...

408
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,232
"shall gain as much as he deserves. "

409
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,190
Pause there, Morocco,

410
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:13,109
and weigh thy value
with an even hand, ha?

411
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,397
I do in birth deserve her, and in fortunes,

412
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,517
and in graces, and in qualities of breeding!

413
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,993
What if I stray no further but choose here?

414
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,913
Hmm...

415
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,796
"Who chooseth me...

416
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,516
"will gain what many men...

417
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,916
"desire. "

418
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,275
- Hmm...
- Huh?

419
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,191
Why, that's the lady!

420
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,874
All of the world desires her!

421
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:53,919
From the four corners of the earth,
they come to kiss this shrine,

422
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,116
this mortal-breathing saint.

423
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:02,792
Deliver me the key.
Here do I choose, and thrive as I may.

424
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,556
There, take it, Prince.

425
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,110
And if my form lie there, I am yours.

426
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,838
Ha!

427
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,433
O hell.

428
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,996
What have we here?

429
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,508
"All that glistens is not gold.

430
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,869
"Often have you heard that told.

431
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:58,520
"Gilded tombs do worms enfold.

432
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,354
"Fare you well...

433
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:06,035
"but your suit is cold. "

434
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,670
For all of my fortune, Shylock,
I give thanks.

435
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:25,228
To best-esteemed acquaintances.

436
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,036
Antonio, good health.

437
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,310
I know the hand. In faith, it is a fair hand,

438
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,756
and whiter than the paper it writ on
is the fair hand that writ.

439
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,319
Love-news, in faith.

440
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,556
Meet me tonight.

441
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:19,878
This is the penthouse under which
Lorenzo desired us to make stand?

442
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,910
His hour is almost past.

443
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,437
And it is a marvel he outstays his hour
for lovers always run before the clock.

444
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,511
That ever holds.

445
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:34,388
Who rises from a feast with
that keen appetite that he sits down?

446
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,636
Sweet friends,
your patience for my long delay.

447
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,235
Ho! Who's within?

448
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,996
Who are you?

449
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:51,119
Tell me for more certainty,
albeit I swear that I do know your tongue.

450
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,350
Lorenzo and thy love.

451
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,273
Lorenzo, certain, and my love indeed,

452
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,954
for who I love so much?

453
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:02,157
And now who knows but you, Lorenzo,
whether I am yours?

454
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,073
Heaven and thy thoughts are witness
that thou art.

455
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,914
Here! Catch this casket.

456
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,195
No!

457
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,838
It is worth the pains.

458
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:32,150
I'm glad 'tis night. You do not look on me
for I am much ashamed of my disguise.

459
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:37,633
But love is blind and lovers cannot see
the pretty follies that themselves commit.

460
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,595
For if they could,
Cupid himself would blush

461
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,194
to see me thus transformed into a boy.

462
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:53,477
Descend, for you must be my torchbearer.

463
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:58,350
Why, 'tis an office of discovery, love,
and I should be obscured.

464
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:03,150
So are you, sweet,
even in the lovely garnish of a boy.

465
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:06,550
But come at once,
for the close night doth play the runaway.

466
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:14,348
I will gild myself with some more ducats
and be with you straight.

467
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:39,599
Contend me, but I love her, heartily.

468
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:44,037
For she is wise, if I can judge of her,

469
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:46,953
and fair, she is, if that mine eyes be true

470
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,600
and true she is, as she hath proved herself.

471
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:53,593
And therefore, like herself,
wise, fair and true,

472
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,069
shall she be placed in my constant soul.

473
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,513
No!

474
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,796
Who's there?

475
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,875
- Signior Antonio!
- Fie, fie, Gratiano.

476
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,793
'Tis ten o'clock, our friends all wait for you.

477
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,030
No masque tonight.

478
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:17,271
The wind has come about,
Bassanio soon will come aboard.

479
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:20,432
I have sent twenty out to seek for you.

480
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,237
Jessica!

481
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,712
Jessica!

482
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,593
Jessica!

483
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:51,116
I will make some speed of my return.

484
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,431
Hurry not business for my sake,
but stay the very riping of the time.

485
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:58,877
And for the Jew's bond that he has
of thee, let it not enter your mind of love.

486
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,837
- Leva i remi.
- Rema.

487
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:03,036
Avanti!

488
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:06,749
Be merry and employ
your chiefest thoughts to courtship,

489
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:11,118
such fair displays of love
as may conveniently become you there.

490
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,839
Tira!

491
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:18,550
Oh... ehi! Oh... ehi!

492
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:23,236
Oh... ehi! Oh... ehi!

493
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,512
No!

494
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,399
No!

495
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,436
No, no.

496
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,794
Jessica!

497
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,876
No.

498
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:56,314
<i>I never heard
a passion so confused,</i>

499
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,039
<i>so strange, outrageous and so variable</i>

500
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:02,430
<i>as the dog Jew did utter in the streets.</i>

501
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:06,752
<i>"My daughter! O my ducats!
O my daughter!"</i>

502
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,069
The villain Jew with outcries
raised the Duke

503
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,674
who went with him
to search Bassanio's ship.

504
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:17,638
He came too late, the ship was under sail.

505
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:22,953
Let good Antonio look he keep his day
or he shall pay for this.

506
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,276
Marry, well remembered.

507
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:30,270
I reasoned with a Frenchman yesterday

508
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,955
who told me, in the narrow seas
that part the French and English

509
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:38,430
there miscarried a vessel of our country
richly fraught.

510
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:43,594
I thought upon Antonio when he told me
and wished in silence that it were not his.

511
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,675
Madam! Madam!

512
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:49,877
Madam!

513
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,795
Oh... Madam!

514
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,109
Quick! Quick!

515
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:00,553
I pray you, the Prince of Aragon
hath taken his oath

516
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,949
and comes to his election presently.

517
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:07,549
Música!

518
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:27,757
"Who chooses me
must give and hazard all he has. "

519
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,595
You shall look fairer ere I give or hazard.

520
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:46,156
What says the golden chest?

521
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:51,357
Ha! Let me see.

522
00:45:54,560 --> 00:46:00,669
"Who chooses me shall gain
what many men desire. "

523
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:10,516
I will not choose what many men desire

524
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:15,314
because I will not jump
with common spirits

525
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:19,397
and rank me with the barbarous multitude.

526
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:35,356
"Who chooses me

527
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:40,150
"shall get as much as he deserves. "

528
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:44,474
And well said, too.

529
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:02,549
I will assume desert.

530
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:05,154
Give me a key for this

531
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:09,233
and instantly unlock my fortunes here.

532
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,831
Too long a pause
for that which you find there.

533
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,192
What's here?

534
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:49,037
The portrait of a blinking idiot
presenting me a schedule?

535
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:58,391
Did I deserve no more than a fool's head?

536
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,755
Is that my prize?

537
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,679
Are my deserts no better?

538
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:11,230
To offend and judge are distinct offices
and of opposed natures.

539
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,515
With one fool's head

540
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,989
I came to woo.

541
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,912
But I go away with two.

542
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:38,989
Antonio's ship is wrecked,
gone down with all hands,

543
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:41,116
all merchandise lost.

544
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,996
Come on up! Come on up.

545
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:50,431
Who is that there?

546
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:52,431
- Jew!
- The Jew! Hey!

547
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:55,159
Take some pleasure with us!

548
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:57,435
Taste my Christian flesh!

549
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:15,956
- What news on the Rialto?
- Why, yet it lives there unchecked

550
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:19,828
that Antonio hath a ship of rich lading
wrecked on the narrow seas -

551
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:24,118
the Goodwins, I think they call the place,
a very dangerous flat and fatal -

552
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:27,237
where the carcasses of
many a tall ship lie buried.

553
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:28,309
What say you?

554
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:31,312
I would it might prove
the end of his losses.

555
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:43,519
How now, Shylock?

556
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,674
What news amongst the merchants?

557
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:51,513
You knew of my daughter's flight.

558
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:56,069
None so well.

559
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:58,792
None so well as you.

560
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:02,429
And Shylock for his own part
knew the bird was fledged

561
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:05,717
and then it is the complexion of them all
to leave the dam.

562
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:08,030
She be damned for it.

563
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:13,831
Tell us, do you hear whether Antonio
have had any loss at sea or no?

564
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,590
Let him look to his bond.

565
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:23,555
He was wont to call me usurer.
Let him look to his bond.

566
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:28,758
He was wont to lend money
for Christian courtesy.

567
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:30,990
Let him look to his bond.

568
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:35,278
Hello, Jew!

569
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:39,956
I'm sure if he forfeit you'll not take
his flesh. What's that good for?

570
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:43,230
To bait fish withal.

571
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:48,517
If it will feed nothing else,
it will feed my revenge.

572
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:52,795
He hath disgraced me

573
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:56,111
and hindered me half a million,

574
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:59,875
laughed at my losses, mocked at my gains,

575
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:03,236
scorned my nation, thwarted my bargains,

576
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:06,551
cooled my friends, heated mine enemies,
and what's his reason?

577
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,710
I am a Jew!

578
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:12,390
Hath not a Jew eyes?

579
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,471
Hath not a Jew hands?

580
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:16,949
Organs, dimensions?

581
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,759
Senses, affections, passions?

582
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:23,310
Fed with the same food?

583
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:26,350
Hurt with the same weapons?

584
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:28,510
Subject to the same diseases?

585
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:31,239
Healed by the same means?

586
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:36,155
Warmed and cooled by the same
winter and summer as a Christian is?

587
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:39,957
If you prick us, do we not bleed?

588
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:42,838
If you tickle us, do we not laugh?

589
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:45,798
If you poison us, do we not die?

590
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:48,792
And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?

591
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:54,237
If we are like you in the rest,
we will resemble you in that.

592
00:51:55,880 --> 00:52:01,193
If a Jew wrong a Christian,
what is his humility? Revenge.

593
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,271
If a Christian wrong a Jew,

594
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:07,035
what should his sufferance be
by Christian example?

595
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:10,196
Why, revenge.

596
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:14,478
The villainy you teach me I will execute.

597
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:19,509
And it shall go hard
but I will better the instruction.

598
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:27,308
Antonio is at his house.
We should speak with him.

599
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,197
How now, Tubal?

600
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,756
What news from Genoa?

601
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:49,552
- Have you found my daughter?
- I often came where I did hear of her

602
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:51,870
but cannot find her.

603
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:56,752
Why...

604
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:01,038
there, there, there.

605
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:03,236
A diamond gone.

606
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:08,433
Cost me two thousand ducats in Frankfurt.

607
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:14,391
The curse never fell upon our nation
till now.

608
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:18,270
I never felt it.

609
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:21,356
Till now.

610
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:28,152
I would my daughter were dead at my foot

611
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:31,869
and the jewel in her ear.

612
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:36,476
No news of them?

613
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:41,273
Loss upon loss.

614
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:47,113
The thief gone with so much
and so much to find the thief.

615
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:53,316
And no satisfaction, no revenge,

616
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:57,438
no luck stirring

617
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:00,114
but what lights on my shoulders.

618
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:04,999
No sighs

619
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:08,350
but of my breathing.

620
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:12,916
No tears but of my shedding.

621
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,709
Yes, other men have ill luck, too.

622
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:21,830
Antonio, as I heard in Genoa.

623
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,672
What?

624
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:26,399
What, what? llI luck?

625
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:30,757
There's a ship, wrecked,
coming from Tripolis.

626
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:33,308
Oh, I thank God.

627
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:35,277
I thank God.

628
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:37,794
Oh!

629
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,833
Heard you in Genoa what?

630
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:47,477
Your daughter spent in Genoa,

631
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:49,835
as I heard,

632
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:53,117
one night, four score ducats.

633
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:00,711
Oh, you stick a dagger in me.

634
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:05,355
I shall never see my gold again.

635
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:09,678
Four score ducats!

636
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:11,716
At a sitting!

637
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:13,950
Four score ducats!

638
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:22,275
There came various of Antonio's creditors
in my company to Venice

639
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:27,472
- that swear he cannot choose but break.
- I am very glad of it.

640
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:29,630
I'll plague him.

641
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:32,837
I'll torture him. I am glad of it.

642
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:37,072
One of them showed me a ring
he had of your daughter

643
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:38,957
for a monkey.

644
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:46,235
<i>How dare her!</i>

645
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:50,712
Tubal, you torture me.

646
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:52,552
It was my turquoise.

647
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:57,589
I had it of Leah, her mother,
when I was a bachelor.

648
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:04,396
I would not have given it away
for a wilderness of monkeys.

649
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:08,712
But Antonio is certainly undone.

650
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:13,111
That is true.

651
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:20,232
Tubal, go, find me an officer.

652
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:23,793
Bespeak him a fortnight before.

653
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:27,640
I will have Antonio's heart if he forfeit.

654
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:33,716
Go, go, Tubal -
at our synagogue, good Tubal.

655
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:42,919
Oh... ehi!

656
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:47,873
Madam!

657
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:52,030
There is alighted at your gate
a young Venetian,

658
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:55,351
one who comes to signify
the approaching of his lord.

659
00:56:55,440 --> 00:57:00,150
I have not seen
so likely an ambassador of love!

660
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:04,028
A day in April never came so sweet
to show how costly summer was at hand

661
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:07,908
as this... oh! Forerunner
comes before his lord.

662
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,959
No more, I pray you. I'm half afraid
you will say anon he is some kin to you,

663
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:14,838
you spin such high-day wit in praising him.

664
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:17,711
Come. Come, Nerissa,

665
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:22,590
for I long to see quick Cupid's post
that comes so mannerly.

666
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:26,229
Bassanio, lord Love, if your will it be.

667
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:36,152
There's something tells me,
but it is not love.

668
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:38,390
I would not lose you.

669
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:42,553
And yourself knows
hate counsels not in such a quality.

670
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:09,871
<i>I would detain you here a month
or two before you venture for me.</i>

671
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:12,554
I could teach you
how to choose right

672
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:15,598
but then I'd break my oath.

673
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:17,636
That will I never do.

674
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:21,394
So may you miss me

675
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:24,995
and if you do, you make me wish that sin
that I had broke my oath.

676
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,869
<i>Contend me with your eyes</i>

677
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:45,679
<i>for they have o'erlooked me
and divided me.</i>

678
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:01,078
One half of me is yours, the other half
yours, mine own, I would say,

679
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:03,310
but if mine, then yours and so...

680
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:05,470
all yours.

681
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:18,078
Let me choose,
for as I am, I live upon the rack.

682
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:20,799
Upon the rack, Bassanio?

683
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:23,997
Then confess what
treason there is mingled with your love.

684
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:27,117
None but that ugly treason of mistrust

685
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:31,234
which makes me fear
the enjoying of my love.

686
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:33,709
Ay but I fear you speak upon the rack,

687
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:36,268
when men enforced do speak anything.

688
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:38,476
Promise me life

689
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:40,516
and I'll confess the truth.

690
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:42,636
Well, then,

691
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:45,876
confess and live.

692
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:50,511
Confess and love has been
the very sum of my confession.

693
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:57,072
But let me to my fortune and the caskets.

694
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,991
Away, then.

695
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:03,310
I am locked in one of them.

696
01:00:57,480 --> 01:01:04,556
So may the outward shows
be least themselves.

697
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:09,717
The world is still deceived
with ornament.

698
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:14,599
In law, what plea so tainted and corrupt

699
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:20,550
but being seasoned with a gracious voice
obscures the show of evil?

700
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:24,797
In religion,

701
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:28,509
what damned error
but some sober brow will bless it

702
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:30,670
and approve it with a text,

703
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:36,232
hiding the grossness with fair... ornament?

704
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:44,156
Look on beauty

705
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:47,350
and you shall see

706
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:50,631
'tis purchased

707
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:54,392
by the weight.

708
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:59,315
Therefore, thou gaudy gold,
I will none of you.

709
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:06,036
Nor none of you, O pale and common
drudge between man and man.
