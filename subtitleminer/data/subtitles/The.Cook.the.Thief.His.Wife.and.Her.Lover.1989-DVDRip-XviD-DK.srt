1
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,280
Go and get the dogs.

2
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,720
Come on, then. Mews!

3
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,200
Come on, now. Open your mouth.
Open your mouth, eh?

4
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,000
Learn to appreciate your food, eh?

5
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:10,360
Compared to what you serve up
in that dirty little canteen of yours,

6
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,800
this is a three-star supper.

7
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,760
You must learn the rules.

8
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,560
I need to eat and drink the very best
and that's expensive.

9
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,320
Have you ever heard of
chicken â la reine Marie

10
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,440
or oyster sauce mornay

11
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,920
or frogs' legs Parisienne?

12
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,960
No. Course you haven't.

13
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,000
Take his pants down! Take his pants down.

14
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,600
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.

15
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,080
Didn't your daddy teach you
to wipe your bottom? Eh?

16
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,200
Albert! Leave him alone.

17
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,000
- Come on, let's eat.
- Oh, let's eat.

18
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:57,640
Before we eat, Georgina,
we must feed and water the animals.

19
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,000
Roy! This is my wife, Georgina Spica.

20
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,480
She's got a heart of gold and a body to match.

21
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,120
I am Albert Spica and I have a heart of gold
and a great deal of money to match.

22
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,480
And you are Roy, who's got absolutely nothing,
except what you owe me.

23
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,080
You are humiliated in front of a lady,
you're humiliated in front of us.

24
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,960
Georgina, I'll be as quick as I possibly can.

25
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:28,440
Gah... You, go and get me some hot water, eh?
And a towel and soap.

26
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,640
Now...

27
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,240
Yeah.

28
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:37,000
Now I've given you a good dinner
and you can have a nice drink.

29
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,240
Now, you behave yourself in future
and pay when I ask you.

30
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,320
- No, no, no...
- Or next time I'll make you eat your own shit

31
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,400
after forcing it through your dick like toothpaste.

32
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,280
No, put that away, Spangler.
Cor blimey, there's a lady present.

33
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,000
She doesn't want to see
your shrivelled contributions.

34
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,960
Ah.

35
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,080
That's it. Thank you very much. Nice, clean...

36
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,520
Give me that towel!

37
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,760
Give me that. Yeah.

38
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:10,120
I never liked that Chinese food
but looking at you now, I like it even less.

39
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,520
Righto, boys!

40
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,880
We must surprise Richard on our anniversary.

41
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,040
Bring the letters.

42
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,520
Georgie, you got ash on your tits.
If you're gonna wear black, don't smoke.

43
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,960
- You look like a tart in black.
- It's blue.

44
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,560
It's black, and don't smoke. It's sloppy in a woman.

45
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,800
No one who's going to eat smokes.

46
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,840
It ruins your taste buds, burns your tongue
and makes your pee stink.

47
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,240
- Rubbish.
- It's not bloody rubbish.

48
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,560
I've smelt the loo
after you've been piddling in there.

49
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,480
When are you gonna learn, smartarse?

50
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,600
Come on, hurry up, boys.

51
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:08,080
Righto, lads, get them numbers up there -
Spica & Boarst.

52
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,440
Where's Richard?

53
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,800
- He's plucking.
- He's plucking, eh? Richard!

54
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,680
Where are you?
Stop that plucking. Where are you?

55
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,520
Now what's that? A-S-P...

56
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:05,000
That's nonsense. Spell it right, for Christ's sake.

57
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,600
Bloody hell. Richard! Rich... Ah!

58
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,280
There you are, Richard. Now...

59
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,440
Leave that out and come and see
what I've got you, eh?

60
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:18,000
I've brought you a present.
This is our anniversary.

61
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,560
Three months of mutual understanding,
eh, Richard?

62
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:26,920
Three months since I first invited you
to be my favourite restaurateur.

63
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,400
Mr. Spica, this is a duck.

64
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,840
Ducks are born with the feathers on

65
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,440
but it's your dinner, Mr. Spica.

66
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,560
If you want the feathers to remain,
we could try the dish,

67
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,520
I suppose, by leaving the feathers as they are.

68
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,680
Canard en ses plumes torche.

69
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,480
Mitchel, you mule.

70
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,960
'Ere, Richard, come and see, come on.

71
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,120
Please, I beg you. Ha! Come on.

72
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,360
Georgina, how many times have I told you?
No smoking in the kitchen.

73
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:07,120
Mitchel, get your arse down here quick. Come on.

74
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:12,400
Now, Richard, this is your... well, our new sign.

75
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,320
Wallop!

76
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,520
Oh, God!

77
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,800
Richard.

78
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,120
- It's dark in the restaurant.
- Yes, Phillipe.

79
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:37,480
Thanks to Mr. Spica's generosity,
it is dark everywhere.

80
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,400
No power, no light.

81
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:49,520
- Were you thinking of a cold buffet tonight?
- But I don't want a cold buffet.

82
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:55,320
- Paté d'alouettes with a chicory sauce.
- Paté d'alouettes with a chicory sauce.

83
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,120
- Terrine de caneton.
- Terrine de canton.

84
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:05,880
- Cold turkey with lemon and basilica.
- Cold turkey with the lemon and basilica.

85
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,920
Anchovies in garlic vinegar.

86
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,840
It doesn't have to be cold,
you've got gas, for God's sake!

87
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,880
Got an arse on her
like two greased watermelons in a sack.

88
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:21,040
Cold chicken, paté d'alouettes,

89
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,760
salade de langoustine,
gâteau de carottes et Gruyére...

90
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:29,720
You. You put them electrics right, Mitchel.
Put them electrics right or...

91
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,800
You don't eat.

92
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,120
I told you not to smoke.

93
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,520
I should stand still, Mr. Spica. Or who knows?

94
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,960
You might spoil something,
put your foot in something.

95
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,800
So, a hot meal for tonight.
Something special, please. How about some...

96
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,920
some, er, les oh d'oeuvres, er, gâteau au poivres,

97
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,840
er, terrine et fillet lamb et poison au er, poi, poi...

98
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:04,320
- It's "poisson".
- What did you say, Georgie?

99
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,680
What did you say? What did you say?

100
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,640
Poisson.

101
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,760
- Well, Mr. Spica, I hope you are hungry.
- Always. Get in there, boys.

102
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:28,320
Go on, Georgie, go in there,
raise your skirts and warm my seat.

103
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:35,040
Eh, what do you think then, eh? What do you...?

104
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,240
If you spent as much money
on the meal, Mr. Spica,

105
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,120
as you waste on the decor,

106
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,640
your taste in good food must surely improve.

107
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,600
You'll cheek me once too often, Boarst.
You rely on me, don't forget.

108
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,680
Without me, you, a foreigner,
you wouldn't last long around here.

109
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,160
Look out there, see what I've brought you.

110
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,880
Two vans full of good stuff,
just right for your kitchen.

111
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,200
- I would not touch it.
- Why on earth not?

112
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:16,400
I insist on buying my own food, Mr. Spica.

113
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,520
Then I can be sure of its quality.

114
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,120
I represent quality round here,
my name is known for it.

115
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,680
I offer quality and protection.

116
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:31,200
Protection against what,
I wonder, Mr. Spica? And whom?

117
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:35,720
Protection, Boarst,
against the rash temper of my men.

118
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,680
Against a sudden arrival of food poisoning.

119
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,560
Against rats. Against the public health inspector.

120
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:50,000
If you are hungry tonight,
you are going to have to wait.

121
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:54,040
Do up the third button
of your expensive jacket, Mr. Spica.

122
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:00,720
You'll feel less empty inside, Mr. Spica.

123
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,040
You can't make me wait.

124
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,240
No, you don't eat it like that! Let me show you.

125
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,400
Oh. Imagine you are sucking
the little fingers of a lady or...

126
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,880
No, you'd never get that close to a lady.
Who'd wanna get that close to you?

127
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:28,160
- I wouldn't be interested in her fingers.
- I'd expect you to say that.

128
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,280
You'd just whip it in, whip it out
and wipe it on your jacket.

129
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,200
Look at your jacket, it's like a pig field.

130
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:38,320
And your nails could do with a clean. Show me.

131
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:43,880
Gawd. Why can't I have some bloody quality
in my associates?

132
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:48,200
From now on, anyone not properly dressed
for dinner will pay for it.

133
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:51,960
I'll write lessons down for you.
Georgina can type them out.

134
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:57,680
"Notes For Gourmets". That's French
for a good eater, isn't it, Boarst?

135
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,800
- Gourmets don't belch.
- On the contrary, on the contrary. They do.

136
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,800
It shows that you are enjoying a meal.

137
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,840
Not with your fingers, Spangler!
That's all you understand -

138
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:12,360
things you eat with your hands
whilst walking down the street.

139
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,400
You told Mews to eat the celery with his fingers.

140
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,640
That's different, you dope.
And it's asparagus, not celery.

141
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:25,480
What's the point of sinking thousands
into a restaurant if you refuse to eat properly?

142
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:29,240
- Tell him, Georgina.
- Tell him what?

143
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:33,880
Just copy Georgina. She knows how to do it.
Cory, get Richard in here.

144
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:38,400
I want my sign fixed up
and put on that wall over the kitchen door.

145
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,840
If Richard was more interested in slogans,
he'd make more money, eh?

146
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,960
This place is too dark.

147
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,720
Oould do with a respray. Gold, it needs more gold.

148
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,200
How about gold and blue?

149
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:57,200
What do you think, Henry?
10,000 should do it - two months' takings.

150
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,960
You should get in there.
Boarst's prices are all over the place.

151
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:06,080
His head's in the clouds. Good cook. Brilliant cook!

152
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,760
Except he puts mushrooms on everything.
Henry, put that cigarette out.

153
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,920
Do you mind if I eat whilst you smoke?

154
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,240
Gordon choked on a cigarette whilst eating -
burnt his epiglottis.

155
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,160
Mitchel, you've got one.
And you don't keep it in your trousers.

156
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:28,880
You don't put orange rind on the edge
of your plate, it goes there, you dolt!

157
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:34,320
What you've got to realise is that
a clever cook puts unlikely things together

158
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,880
like duck and orange, like pineapple and ham.

159
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,920
It's called artistry.

160
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,080
I'm an artist, the way I combine
my business and my pleasure.

161
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,480
Money's my business, eating's my pleasure.

162
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,720
And Georgie's my pleasure too,
though in a more private kind of way

163
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,480
than stuffing the mouth and feeding the sewers.

164
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,600
Though the pleasures are related,

165
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:02,120
because the naughty bits and the dirty bits
are so close together

166
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:07,400
that it just goes to show
how eating and sex are related.

167
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:11,360
Georgie's naughty bits
are nicely related, aren't they?

168
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,440
Especially when she's
paying me attention. Georgie.

169
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:21,280
Get Phillipe! In future, I want my napkins
folded at home, Georgina. Get Adele to teach you.

170
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,240
Spangler, get up and get Phillipe.

171
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:29,160
Bring Richard here,
I've got to make him a proposition.

172
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:32,880
Get Adele to get that water
with the angostura bitters in it

173
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:37,200
and some lemon in the water
and a bowl of ice water for me fingers...

174
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:41,840
Henry! Give me those glasses off that table.
And the flowers.

175
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,720
This should look the most important table here.

176
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:49,120
I like a load of glasses around, it highers the tone.

177
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,680
- What's that?
- For Madame Spica, compliments of the house.

178
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,720
She's no Madame. Why haven't I got one?

179
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:14,720
- I doubt, Mr. Spica, if you'll like it.
- Try me.

180
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,920
We have grown accustomed
to you being a conservative eater.

181
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,280
That's not true. I'm as adventurous as the next.

182
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,360
Your wife has an excellent palate, Mr. Spica.

183
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,360
It is always a pleasure for us to serve her.

184
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:15,120
I want one of those hot, damp towels,
Richard, served to me with tongs.

185
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:21,040
Adele is no good with cash and figures.
She's just decorative, all lips and tits.

186
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,000
- We'll replace her.
- Can I do the replacing?

187
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:29,840
Stuff your mouth, Mitchel. Every time you open it,
you just show how vulgar you can be.

188
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,480
Georgina! Welcome back.

189
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:09,160
Did you wipe the seat
before you parked your bum?

190
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:14,080
You never know what you can catch these days.
Every toilet seat is a minefield.

191
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:20,280
That's for you. Richard thought I might like
to taste it, personal compliments of the chef.

192
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:23,640
Eat it. I didn't fancy it, it smelt off.

193
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,480
Iris got a canker on her bum
from sitting on a loo seat.

194
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:33,080
The mechanic across the road poured
battery acid down the WO to clear it.

195
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:38,320
Some of it splashed on the seat.
Iris ran screaming into the street,

196
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,400
her backside hissing.

197
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,360
She hasn't been the same since.

198
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:47,320
She strips the same
but never with her back to the audience.

199
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:51,560
She had to change her act.
Now it's more full-frontal.

200
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,720
- Where are you going?
- I left my lighter in the toilet.

201
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,440
- Gawd's sake. You don't need it.
- I need it.

202
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:02,560
Richard, I'm going to ban smoking in here.
Tomorrow, the signs are going up.

203
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,880
You want to thicken your French accent
up a bit, mate,

204
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,360
like you've just come over from Paris.

205
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:12,880
Give them a bit of that ooh-la-la stuff.
Bit more of that "parlez-vous français?"

206
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,880
Then you would not understand me, Mr. Spica.

207
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,040
I don't know. I've always been able
to understand French letters.

208
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,840
Georgina!

209
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,400
What the hell are you doing in here?

210
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,120
Georgina?

211
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,240
You've been in here for ages.
What are you doing, having a baby?

212
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,600
I'm, er, I'm just...

213
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,160
- I'm just having a quiet smoke.
- Smoke?

214
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:15,440
You know how you hate me smoking at the table.

215
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,920
Gawd's sake, Georgina.

216
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,840
Why tell me lies about a lost lighter?

217
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:25,600
I didn't, I left it here
on the ledge in front of the mirror.

218
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,800
I'll be out in a few moments.

219
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:34,440
Don't hang around the ladies,
you'll embarrass the customers.

220
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,480
Show me the lighter.

221
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,000
There.

222
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,280
Do you want a cigarette as well?

223
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,680
Don't be so bloody stupid.

224
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,840
What are you doing in there,
Georgina, eh?

225
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,960
You playing with yourself?

226
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:56,560
That's not allowed, that's my property.
You're not allowed to fiddle with it.

227
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:01,720
- Shut up, Albert.
- Let me in, I'll show you how to wipe yourself.

228
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,120
Go away. I'll be out in a minute.

229
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,040
Well, don't be long.

230
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:12,120
I'll order you some gâteau aux poivres.

231
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,160
Some profiteroles.

232
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,120
And wash your hands.

233
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,040
You don't know the women who use this place.

234
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,480
You took your time.

235
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,960
I thought you'd like me to wait for you.

236
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,760
You smell nice and sweaty.

237
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,280
Wash your hands, I'll give you a kiss.

238
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:01,920
You know what they say about men
who hang around ladies' lavatories?

239
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,040
What do they say about men
who hang around ladies' lavatories?

240
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,160
- They're asking to have their illusions shattered.
- Yeah.

241
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,400
You hold no illusions for me, Georgie, eh?

242
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,760
No stone's been left unturned.

243
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,200
Look, just go order my profiteroles, will you?

244
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,440
Come on.

245
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,600
Come on.

246
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,760
I think these Ethiopians like starving.

247
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:20,080
It keeps them slim and graceful, with those
big heads and dreamy eyes. You know those kids.

248
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:24,520
- You're sick.
- I might well be if you're being so priggish.

249
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:30,200
What do you know, Georgina, about
the starving? You can have anything you want.

250
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:35,400
- Where you been? You're late.
- It's Friday night. There's a lot of money about.

251
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:41,240
A decent man needs gloves to touch this stuff.
Let's have a look.

252
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:44,120
That's just what this restaurant needs.

253
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,800
Start laying them out.

254
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,200
What's the matter, Mitchel?
Don't you like mussels?

255
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:53,520
You got to learn to like them
if you're going to eat with me.

256
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,080
Don't you dare throw up in here!

257
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:59,520
Or I'll get Spangler to stuff 'em
back down your throat.

258
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:05,320
From the Malay restaurant.
The food poisoning scared them, they're paying up.

259
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,360
I'm sure they don't need our assistance with that.

260
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:11,720
That stuff they eat,
they'd poison themselves with it.

261
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:16,000
Some of them Indians are well known
for drinking their own pee.

262
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,680
The same water would go round and round.

263
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:24,400
Of course, you're bound to lose some
through evaporation.

264
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,680
Then you'd have to top it up.
Whose pee would you drink first?

265
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,840
- Erm...
- Me, I'd have a ready supply, wouldn't I?

266
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:35,440
Georgie and I have our little sessions when we...

267
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,720
Good God, what have you got there?

268
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:42,160
Even you are getting compliments
from the chef, are you?

269
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,720
Being a guinea pig
for a Boarst experiment, are we?

270
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:52,080
Good God, looks like, er,
food for constipated French rabbits.

271
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:56,760
Albert, why don't you order me some chianti?
You know I like chianti.

272
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:59,360
In the bottle with the wrapping around it.

273
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,520
Then I can take it home and hang it on the wall.

274
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:06,440
- Grace, haven't you got enough of them already?
- No.

275
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,560
Where the hell are you going?

276
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,120
- To the toilet.
- You haven't had anything to drink yet.

277
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:16,160
She's got a bladder like a leaky marrow.
Don't be long!

278
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,280
- You've upset her.
- Rubbish.

279
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:25,320
Don't be long! You're so talkative tonight,
we couldn't stand the silence without you.

280
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,560
Wash your hands!

281
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,520
- Questo, questo.
- Oazzo.

282
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,360
Dove hai imparato a cucinare? È velenoso.

283
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,600
Vieni qua.

284
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,000
That's off!

285
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,040
Uh.

286
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:35,920
- This custard's salty.
- It is sauce Hollandaise.

287
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,960
Can I help you, Mr. Spica?

288
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:41,440
I've come about
those special complimentary dishes.

289
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:45,120
In future, all the guests at my table
shall receive them.

290
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,640
Why is my fish taking so long?

291
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:50,920
You can carry it in yourself, if you like, Mr. Spica.

292
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,800
- What are you looking for?
- Nothing. You bring it.

293
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:00,560
- You would not be looking for your wife?
- No, of course not.

294
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,600
Mr. Spica, I have something to show you.

295
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:21,080
- What is this?
- New cutlery. Give your restaurant some style.

296
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:25,560
I brought in 300 sets.
My men are just re-laying the tables.

297
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,520
Not very good quality, Mr. Spica.

298
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:35,840
You could use them at home, Mr. Spica.

299
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,560
All 300 of them.

300
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,320
Where have you been? Wiping your bum?

301
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,720
Did you use your left hand like I showed you?

302
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:23,480
Where'd you get this stuff, Mews?
It's rubbish, falling apart.

303
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:28,200
Take 'em back. Get a 150% refund. God.

304
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:34,080
What are you eating, Georgie? Not much.

305
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:38,720
Ha! I see others here
get the same special attentions.

306
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:43,760
What is it? Looks like
some sort of... watery salade.

307
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,040
That's not up to much.

308
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:49,120
Expensive, no doubt, but not fattening.

309
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,480
You've got to keep your strength up,
you're looking peaky.

310
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,560
Kidneys, liver, iron, that's what you need.

311
00:35:55,640 --> 00:36:01,560
Do you know a cow drinks
its own weight in water twice a week?

312
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:06,160
For milk, you see,
because a cow's got great big tits.

313
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,520
Just like you, eh, Georgie?

314
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:15,760
You gentlemen will have to take it
for granted because

315
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:19,240
for some reason best known to herself,

316
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,400
she's left her bra off.

317
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,400
Have you, Cory, ever tasted human milk?

318
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,880
I mean recently. All them years ago don't count.

319
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,520
You couldn't really appreciate
what you were enjoying then, could you?

320
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:41,320
I bet human milk's a great delicacy
in some countries. It ought to be here.

321
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,760
Do you know, Cory, who could supply us
with some human milk?

322
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:49,960
Warm, straight from the receptacle,
so to speak?

323
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:53,960
Don't joke! It's a precious commodity,
not a joking matter!

324
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,680
Georgie wouldn't joke about it, would you?

325
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,760
Would you, Georgie?

326
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:04,120
Ah. You're a credit to women. You could show
these young women a thing or two.

327
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:07,960
You could teach these young men
a thing or two. Take Mitchel.

328
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:11,600
On second thoughts, don't,
cos he's a crude little bugger.

329
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:15,320
- Then how come you haven't got any kids?
- Kids?

330
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:20,600
Who needs kids? Who wants kids?

331
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,560
I want kids.

332
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:29,400
We'll have kids one day, won't we, eh?

333
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:35,320
When you're bloody old and grey, most like!

334
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,920
Yeah. Your trouble is you don't eat properly.

335
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:43,800
You should drink more water and eat more kidneys

336
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:47,760
and then you might bloody well have
a bloody baby someday.

337
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:51,880
Georgie doesn't like babies, do you?

338
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:56,960
You know, sometimes, Georgie,
I think you behave like a bloke.

339
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,000
What days are those, then, Albert?

340
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,040
- What's it like?
- You what?

341
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:05,680
Get away from this table, you mucky little wimp!

342
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:10,600
Go and eat your vegetable soup in the kitchen,
you dirty little pervert!

343
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:13,680
Go on, get on with your eating, eh?

344
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,840
It's only Mitchel making a fool of himself.

345
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,800
Now, stand in the corner.
Cory, make him a paper hat.

346
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,920
Stand in the corner like a naughty little boy.

347
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,200
Stand there. Take your knife and fork with you.

348
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,960
- Don't be stupid.
- Do you want to join him?

349
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:35,720
Leave him alone. He's only copying you
like he always does. You behave, he'll behave.

350
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,560
- I'm leaving.
- Yes, we are leaving.

351
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:43,440
Gracie, here. Pay the bill and take a taxi.

352
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:48,400
Yeah. Georgie and I might go for a little drive.

353
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,160
It's our wedding anniversary tomorrow.

354
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,800
Might drive down to the sea,

355
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,680
have some fun under the pier like we used to.

356
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,480
Oops. I am sorry.

357
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:15,280
Still, this isn't a library, it's a restaurant.

358
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,320
They got people for that.

359
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,600
Richard.

360
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:26,840
This needs cooking.
Grill it with some mashed peas.

361
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:53,360
What's a young lad like you doing
washing dishes?

362
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,480
That's woman's work,
ain't you got what it takes? Hey!

363
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:00,920
My God, armour plating.
You protect yourself, son, you need it.

364
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,040
Innocence. That's what I had before I met Georgie.

365
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:07,400
- That's just what they want.
- Albert. Come on, you're drunk.

366
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,560
- Come on!
- Shall I sing for you?

367
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,560
- What?
- Albert, come on, he's only a child.

368
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:16,160
Sing for me, yes. Yes, you can sing for me.

369
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,600
Get up there. You sing, yeah.

370
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:23,240
I was a good singer when I was a little boy,
wasn't I, Georgie?

371
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:26,240
Come on, now. You sing to me. Eh?

372
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,240
Come on. Sing, damn you!

373
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:42,680
- You can't keep it up, can you? No.

374
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,000
I was a choirboy once.

375
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:48,040
Yes. Women like choirboys.

376
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:51,640
I was almost a choirboy when I met Georgie.

377
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:54,400
But you spoilt all that, didn't you?

378
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:58,760
Georgie was a very good education,
she could teach a young man anything.

379
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:03,080
Come on, Georgie, show the young boy
what you showed me.

380
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,840
- Albert.
- Go on, show the little boy...

381
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:09,040
- Albert!
- You do what I tell you, will you?

382
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:13,440
You come out in that car park with me,
both of you. Come on.

383
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,480
Out in the car park. Come on.

384
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:25,240
I'll give you the best education,
show you what a great teacher Georgie can be.

385
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,400
Don't touch him!

386
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:31,560
Leave him alone.
I'll show you what a great teacher...

387
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:36,520
Oh, I see. So I'm not supposed to do that?
I'll give you an education.

388
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:39,040
- Albert, please leave him alone.
- Oh, no.

389
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,800
Stand there and don't you move.

390
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,840
- Just leave him be.
- Watch this.

391
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:48,160
- No. Wait till we get home, Albert.
- Georgie. Georgie, come here.

392
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:52,600
Right. What's all this?
You're not wearing any bloody knickers.

393
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:56,080
You've been sitting in that restaurant
with no knickers on?

394
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:00,160
With Cory and Mitchel and all those people?
What's this mean?

395
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,520
Where are they? Give them to me at once.

396
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:06,760
Go on. Look at this.
Get in that car, you dirty whore.

397
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:10,440
Why don't you take everything off?

398
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:14,840
Get in there. Go on! Get in that car!

399
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:18,520
- Now you! You get in there as well.
- No!

400
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:22,240
- Go on. Get in there. Get in.
- No! Please!

401
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:26,480
- No! No! No!
- Get in there! Get in.

402
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,600
Aah! Ah!

403
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:35,520
Right...

404
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,720
No!

405
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,120
I have two minutes.

406
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,840
Do you know, Mitchel, what prairie oysters are?

407
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,800
Fish.

408
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:42,200
So if someone feeds you a prairie oyster,
what would you be eating?

409
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:46,200
Fish. Like from the lakes and that. They're the...

410
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:48,720
The clams with the little pearls in.

411
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:53,160
Prairie oysters would be very precious
to their owners. No.

412
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:55,200
No, look. Imagine...

413
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:59,280
Just imagine that this is a prairie oyster.

414
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:03,360
Now, go on. Eat that. Go on.
Put it in your mouth. Go on. Go on.

415
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,000
Now, what's it taste like?

416
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,280
- Wet bread.
- No.

417
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:13,160
It's all squishy with gritty bits in it.

418
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:17,040
That's the sand.

419
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,760
That's the sand. You're a comic.

420
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:25,360
No, you mule. It's got a skin round it.

421
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:30,520
- Do you spit the skin out?
- No.

422
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:33,680
Pick it out of your teeth afterwards, chump it up.

423
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,800
Now, swallow that, go on, swallow it. Swallow it.

424
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,840
Go on, that's right.

425
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:43,000
Now, Mitchel, you have just eaten
a sheep's bollock.

426
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:51,600
The next time I ask you to work for me, Mitchel,

427
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:55,480
I'll be expecting you to chew
someone's bollocks off on demand.

428
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,160
Oh, you're back.

429
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:04,480
What do you find in that toilet that's so fascinating?
I'll go and have a pee and a look.

430
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:09,400
What have they got since I was last in there?
Velvet seats, dirty pictures? Hah.

431
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:12,960
Free perfume? A private drinks bar?

432
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:45,200
Cor, what a disgusting smell in here!

433
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:48,920
Must be the pigs using it, eh? How disgusting it is.

434
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Ha! Urgh, how horrible. Disgusting.

435
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:56,240
Revolting place, needs airing out. What's this?

436
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:58,680
Gaw, phwoar, phwoar...

437
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:04,520
Look. "There was a young man from Uckinham
who got caught while he was... "

438
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:08,800
That is disgusting!
People ought to be locked up for that.

439
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,920
Absolutely appalling. Not what I'm used to at all.

440
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,440
It's disgraceful. Don't you reckon, don't you think?

441
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,640
Yes. God.

442
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:20,800
- 'Ere, what are you looking at?
- What are you talking about?

443
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:25,080
Don't pretend. You're waiting
for my young associates, aren't you?

444
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:28,280
A man ought to be able to piss
without harassment.

445
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:31,280
- How dare you? I'm getting the manager.
- I am the manager.

446
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:35,360
And you are out on the street.
Caught loitering in a toilet.

447
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,840
- Ow!
- Yeah.

448
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:43,000
That's what these people need.
Short, sharp, shock treatment.

449
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:52,320
Hello. What are you doing? Reading again?

450
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:57,360
This is not a library. The only thing
you're allowed to read in here is the menu.

451
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,880
You are insulting the chef.

452
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:03,080
Reading gives you indigestion,
didn't you know that?

453
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:05,400
Don't read at the table.

454
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:11,360
I've just been reading stuff to make your hair curl.

455
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,600
Out there, in the toilet.

456
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:16,760
That's the sort of stuff people read, not this.

457
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:19,200
Don't you feel out of touch?

458
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,640
Does this stuff make money?

459
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:26,080
You know, I bet you're
the only man who's read this book.

460
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:29,680
But I bet you every man here
has read that stuff out there.

461
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,280
It makes you think, doesn't it?

462
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:36,520
You know, I reckon you read
because you got nobody to talk to.

463
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:41,040
I tell you what. So you shouldn't eat alone,
why don't you come and join us?

464
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:43,280
Come and meet my wife.

465
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:48,680
She's seen you.
I know she's sorry for you sitting here all alone.

466
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:53,720
She likes to read too.
She spends hours sitting on the bed reading.

467
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:56,320
She even reads on the john.

468
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:05,400
This is Cory.

469
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:11,600
This is Mitchel. He can't read, can you, Mitchel?

470
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:14,760
- Yes, I can.
- Yeah. Comics and dirty magazines.

471
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:19,280
And this is Georgina. She is my wife.

472
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,880
What's your name?

473
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:28,440
- Michael.
- Well, Michael. Is that a Jewish name, Michael?

474
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:33,760
Do you eat kosher food, Michael? Sit down,
Michael, and tell us all about kosher food, Michael.

475
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:36,760
- I'm sorry but I'm not Jewish.
- Why hide it?

476
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:41,240
60% of the people in this restaurant
are a touch Jewish, Michael.

477
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:43,480
Richard, set another place for Michael.

478
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:48,560
He is Jewish, so maybe you could find him
some spare ribs. No pork.

479
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:54,960
He won't need those.
We're going to hold a conversation, aren't we?

480
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:58,800
You can start, Georgie.
Tell Michael all about yourself.

481
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:03,880
- I'm sure your wife would rather eat in peace.
- No. Talk, Georgina.

482
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:07,560
Here's your chance
to improve your table conversation.

483
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:09,680
Tell Michael you live in a big house

484
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:12,400
and you spend £400 a week on clothes.

485
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,480
I spend £400 a week on clothes.

486
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:17,760
You have a petrol allowance of £40 a week.

487
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:21,520
I have a petrol allowance of £40 a week,
which I never use.

488
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:24,320
- You wear beautiful things.
- I wear beautiful things.

489
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:27,600
- You eat in the best restaurants.
- I eat in the best restaurants.

490
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:30,360
Georgina, try a little harder, please.

491
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:36,000
- I go to a good hairdresser.
- Yes, the best there is.

492
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:40,000
- I go to a good dentist.
- Yes, yeah, oh, yeah. He's Jewish.

493
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:43,240
- I go to a good gynaecologist.
- You what?

494
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:48,080
- Who says it's unlikely I'll ever have a baby.
- Michael doesn't want to know that.

495
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:51,480
That the three miscarriages
have ruined my insides.

496
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:55,000
That isn't true, Michael doesn't need to know that.

497
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:59,000
Now, drink up, Michael, let's talk about you.
What do you do?

498
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,560
I'm a gynaecologist.

499
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:08,000
- You're a what?
- You could always come and see me.

500
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:10,560
We don't need to discuss that subject.

501
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:14,320
Being infertile makes me a safe bet
for a good screw.

502
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,440
Shut up, Georgie!

503
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:22,320
I must apologise for my wife, Michael.

504
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:27,720
If you don't get back to your table,
you're in danger of losing it.

505
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:29,800
The place gets very full about now.

506
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:34,240
Mitchel, take Michael back to his table.
Tell him about horses.

507
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:36,920
Oh, it's all right, Mr. Spica, thank you.

508
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:40,200
I prefer to read my book.

509
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,440
Besides, I've finished. Thank you.

510
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:48,080
Thank you for introducing me to your wife.

511
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:51,040
I like your name.

512
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:39,120
Ah.

513
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:46,280
What the hell do you think you're doing? Eh?

514
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:52,280
Telling a complete stranger
intimate details about us?

515
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:54,880
It's not about us. It's about me.

516
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,400
It's about us!

517
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:00,840
And what's all this,
how much time you spend in that loo?

518
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:03,920
What's all this about a gynaecologist? Who is he?

519
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:09,120
It'd better be a she.
I don't want some bloke fingering my wife about.

520
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:12,320
It's a man. He's Jewish.

521
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:16,640
- And he's from Ethiopia.
- What?

522
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:20,520
His mother is a Roman Catholic,
he's been in prison in South Africa,

523
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:24,520
he's as black as the ace of spades
and probably drinks his own pee.

524
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:26,760
- Take that, you bitch!
- Oh!

525
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:30,480
You lying, ungrateful bitch! You get in that car.

526
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:33,000
It's the doghouse for you, you bitch.

527
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:37,840
Bloody gynaecologist. Blasted gynaecologist.

528
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,600
Get up. Get up.

529
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:47,720
Get in the car, you slag.

530
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,080
Get in there. Go on.

531
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:56,000
Yeah.

532
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:22,720
Maiser came here.

533
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:27,480
And Trelawny with his black lady friends
who wore peaches in their hair.

534
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:29,680
- Peaches?
- Imitation.

535
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:34,240
And the Austrian brothers sat by the door -
high-wire professionals.

536
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:36,600
Great balancers, sloppy with money.

537
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:43,600
And Tim Tranter drank soup here
out of a cup with a straw when his jaw was broken.

538
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:48,720
There used to be a mark up there
where Goshy Capps threw a plate of kippers.

539
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:51,320
- Kippers?
- Yes, kippers, for God's sake.

540
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,680
You wouldn't find kippers here.

541
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:57,600
- They serve kippers for breakfast here.
- You've had breakfast here?

542
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:00,600
The ferryman and his lady ate here every morning.

543
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:04,880
The ferryman was a poofter.
And fish disagreed with him.

544
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:09,160
- Who are all these people?
- Small-time crooks and pimps...

545
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:12,400
Boarst painted it out.
I'll get him to paint it back again.

546
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:16,120
...gigolos, busted boxers, cheap whores...

547
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:18,400
I've got the clippings at home.

548
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:21,480
...bullies, hairdressers, faggots.

549
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:24,040
- Robin Hoods.
- No, just hoods.

550
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:29,160
You're getting very smart.
Smart? Even his slang's out of date.

551
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:32,640
Now I'm the clientele,
you understand? Me.

552
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:36,560
And Georgie here and Cory Peterson.
The coq au vin is good.

553
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:40,600
Cock a what?
Chicken cooked in wine, you mule.

554
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:44,960
- Bess Riddle lived on coq au vin.
- More of the coq than the vin.

555
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:48,640
Starkie, there are ladies present.

556
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:52,480
- Or there were. Where's she gone?
- Gracie's no lady, are you?

557
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:55,760
- She must have a bladder infection.
- She's one of us.

558
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:59,520
There's nothing wrong
except she disappears to the john.

559
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:02,920
And which of the bladder infections
do you have, Starkie?

560
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,200
Ladies go to the toilet, not the john.

561
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:09,520
Real ladies don't go to the toilet,
they go to the bathroom.

562
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:13,920
- Boarst hasn't got a bathroom.
- Shut your mouth.

563
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,160
You'd pee in your pants
before you'd recognise a respectable WC.

564
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:29,240
So, he's broken the silence for us

565
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:32,760
and your name is Georgina.

566
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:39,520
Yes. And don't ever call me Georgie.

567
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:43,920
You have beautiful eyes, Georgina.

568
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:52,160
And you have a beautiful prick, Mr. Gynaecologist.

569
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:57,480
- I have?
- Yes, whatever its racist beliefs.

570
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:04,480
- Your husband is a curiosity.
- He is?

571
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,680
Why?

572
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:13,800
Why what?

573
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:18,360
Why am I married to him?

574
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:22,920
Why aren't you married?

575
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,520
- How do you know I'm not?
- You're not.

576
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:30,320
- I'm not.
- Why?

577
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:40,200
I once saw a film in which the main character
didn't speak for the first half an hour.

578
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:45,320
Like us? Do all the minutes we've been together
add up to half an hour?

579
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:53,320
I was completely absorbed as to what would
happen because anything was possible.

580
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:57,360
And then?

581
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:00,480
He spoilt it - he spoke.

582
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:05,760
- And?
- Within five minutes, I'd lost interest.

583
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:11,800
So now you've opened your mouth,
do you expect me to lose interest?

584
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:15,520
It was only a film.

585
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:23,240
Erm, now, we've been talking for one minute.

586
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:27,760
We've got four minutes left
before you lose interest.

587
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:30,280
Four minutes. That's enough.

588
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:32,440
Where's the bomb?

589
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:39,680
He's, er... He's eating
avocado vinaigrette and prawns.

590
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,920
With his fingers.

591
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:46,640
Kiss me.

592
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:55,760
- Your restaurant's noisy, Spica.
- It's popular on a Sunday night.

593
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:58,560
I like a quiet restaurant, with floor shows.

594
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:02,320
Boarst is a culinary artist, not a fancy entertainer.

595
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:05,880
But we're here to please you, Terry.
We'll get you a floor show.

596
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:10,040
Cory, phone Santini. Five girls - strippers.

597
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:13,000
Make it decent, will you? My daughter's present.

598
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:16,920
Five dancing girls with music.
Strictly no filth, only class.

599
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:20,000
And make it quiet.
I want to keep my ears till I'm 90.

600
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:24,480
God, Terry, what sort of floor show
do you like? Mute nuns?

601
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:28,560
If they call me Mr. Fitch, I might.
I'm only Terry to my wife, Spica.

602
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:31,800
- Like me.
- You're Terry and all, are you?

603
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:35,560
- I'm only Albert to Georgina.
- Even when she's in the loo?

604
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:39,040
- Shut your whore up, Cory!
- God, you're noisy, Spica.

605
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:42,880
Makes for indigestion.
Don't you find, love? What's your name?

606
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:44,280
Patricia, Mr. Fitch.

607
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:48,240
Are you a good dancer?
You look as if you might be a good dancer.

608
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:52,160
We'd like to see you get up and dance, with Geoff.

609
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:54,400
Geoff's a very good dancer.

610
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:58,040
- There's no dancing allowed.
- I always eat at home.

611
01:00:58,120 --> 01:01:00,520
- Best place.
- No food poisoning.

612
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:05,440
Ricky Boarst is as safe as houses.
He keeps a very clean kitchen, go and see.

613
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:07,600
I'd like to see.

614
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:12,920
- Mitchel, take the lady to see the kitchen.
- I'll take her myself, Spica.

615
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:18,920
- Show me the way.
- Through that door.

616
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:23,000
I'll call in the bathroom
and send Georgie back tout de suite.

617
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:25,200
That means immediately.

618
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:29,680
- Your new girlfriend's cheap, Cory.
- She's only practising her French.

619
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,080
It's a French restaurant, isn't it?

620
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:57,560
Someone's having pheasant for dinner.

621
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:05,920
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...

622
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:10,760
We could be interrupted, um... 700 times.

623
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:18,160
- What's your boyfriend paying you, Patricia?
- Paying me? He doesn't pay me.

624
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:21,040
He buys me meals and drinks.

625
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:24,040
- Doesn't he give you no pocket money?
- No.

626
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:27,680
Nothing for a tuna fish sandwich
late at night or a bottle of gin

627
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:30,920
- to make you forget what you had for lunch?
- No.

628
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:34,240
Phew, it stinks here.

629
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:39,920
Listen, how about if...

630
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,080
if I gave you some pocket money?

631
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:45,320
What do I have to do to earn it?

632
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:08,600
OK, here they are. Where's Fitch?

633
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:12,080
Phillipe, clear those tables. We need more space.

634
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:15,160
- But Mr. Spica, they are eating.
- Move them.

635
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:19,240
You are in the way of the floor show.
You're gonna have to move.

636
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:21,360
We're in the middle of our meal.

637
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:25,920
If you're going to eat quite quickly,
you can finish your soup.

638
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:30,200
After all, you don't want
to get trampled on, do you?

639
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:33,520
Hold him. Hold him.

640
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:39,240
It's a pity you didn't take my advice.

641
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:42,640
All that lovely food. Richard will be disappointed.

642
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:48,440
Now, you're gonna have to eat in the kitchen
like naughty little children, eh?

643
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:50,880
Hey, what is your name?

644
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:54,480
What did you say? Did I hear you say William?

645
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:58,320
Well, naughty little Willie, tiny little Willie,

646
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:01,640
how would you like
to be spanked on your big, fat bottom?

647
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:14,560
Seeing as you're so keen
on Richard's mushrooms, William,

648
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:19,560
you, I'm gonna give you five, the count of five

649
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:23,360
and I want to see you on the way to the kitchen

650
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:25,440
or you'll be out in the street!

651
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:27,480
Get out.

652
01:04:57,080 --> 01:05:00,480
- Oh, look at the time. I must go back.
- One minute more.

653
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:03,160
- No.
- 30 seconds.

654
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:17,840
Oh! Oh!

655
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:21,280
Oh. What the hell are you doing?

656
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:24,440
I bought meself a ride. Why don't you keep still?

657
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:26,760
Sorry, I had a surprise.

658
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:32,000
What bloody surprises
could there be possibly left for you?

659
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:34,120
I give up, you bitch.

660
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:37,520
I'm sick of jumpy whores.

661
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:43,360
You're only worth a Fitch one star -
that ain't for looks, that's for availability.

662
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:12,000
Look who's just come out of the woodwork.

663
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:30,320
- What've you been doing?
- I've just been earning you good money.

664
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:34,040
And I've just seen
how we can earn ourselves some more.

665
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:53,000
We have complaints of offensive smells
from two vans on the restaurant premises.

666
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:56,080
The restaurant denies any responsibility. Over.

667
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:00,760
Why can't we meet somewhere else?

668
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:05,240
That's impossible.
It's better to do it under his nose.

669
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:09,120
He'll never believe I do it right under his nose

670
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:13,200
between courses,

671
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:16,120
between the hors d'oeuvres
and the canard â I'orange,

672
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:18,160
between the dessert and the coffee.

673
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:21,800
Besides,

674
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:24,880
I'm learning fast

675
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:28,080
how to cut corners, save time.

676
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:33,520
I'm getting good at it, aren't I, Michael? Aren't I?

677
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:37,840
Aren't I getting good at it? Aren't I?

678
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:40,440
Aren't I getting good at it? Mm.

679
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:44,320
Aren't I getting good at it? Oh.

680
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:53,800
Last night was bloody awful
and you're to blame, Cory.

681
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:57,640
- Tonight you'll starve.
- I don't like the foreign muck anyway.

682
01:07:57,720 --> 01:08:02,600
Don't talk to me like that, you uneducated prat!
You couldn't organise a rape in a brothel!

683
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:08,520
The girls were lousy, the music was lousy,
you mucked the whole thing up.

684
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:11,760
Oouldn't keep your own girl
under control at all. Tch!

685
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:14,520
- First she shows off...
- I didn't.

686
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:17,040
Shut your face, who's talking to you?

687
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:19,280
Then she goes and plays hard to get.

688
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:23,720
I mean, if she's been with you, Cory,
how the hell can she be hard to get?

689
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:30,960
Spangler, get us a drink, quickly.
Then she upsets Fitch in some way.

690
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:33,840
- Fitch is a pig.
- Fitch has got manners.

691
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:36,920
He was like a bear with a sore head.
Did you piss in his pants?

692
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:40,840
Then she's giggling like a virgin
playing with a candle.

693
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:45,720
You'll have to make it up to him.
He likes you, though you look like a bloke.

694
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:49,440
- Perhaps he likes blokes.
- None of that homosexual talk.

695
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:52,680
He'll remember.
Yesterday evening's got my name on it.

696
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:56,920
I'm not going with him.
He sweats and stinks and he can't make it.

697
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,360
- Shut your whore up, Cory.
- Like Georgie?

698
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:02,640
- Shut up!
- She's a fine woman. She's never let me down.

699
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:05,160
- You must be joking.
- Shut up, Pat!

700
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:07,920
- She's upset.
- What do you mean, I must be joking?

701
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,800
- Here. Get rid of her.
- Don't do that to a woman.

702
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:13,960
- I do what I like to a woman.
- That's your trouble.

703
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:18,040
No wonder Georgie looks like she does
and hates your guts.

704
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:21,280
- What are you talking about?
- No wonder she screws around.

705
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:24,920
- You what?
- You're so bloody blind, you'd never notice.

706
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,720
- Shut up! She's raving.
- I'm not. I saw them.

707
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:29,760
- Who?
- Georgie and that Jew.

708
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:33,480
- What Jew?
- That bloke who sits over there, reading.

709
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:37,360
Haven't you noticed?
They always go off to the john together.

710
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:41,960
- You what?
- Why do you think Georgie's always in the john?

711
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:45,800
You blind bat.
She doesn't have the shits every five minutes.

712
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:48,600
Shit!

713
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:57,920
Shh. It's all right. It's all right. Shh. Quiet.

714
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,960
Shh. Shh.

715
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:03,640
Shh.

716
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:27,760
I'm going to the loo.

717
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:38,560
Georgina!

718
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:42,520
Georgina!

719
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:46,600
Georgina, where are you, you bitch? Georgina!

720
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:51,040
- What are you doing? Get out!
- Get out, you bitch. Georgina!

721
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:53,080
Where are you? Get out!

722
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:55,200
Go on, get out!

723
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:57,400
Where are you?

724
01:10:57,480 --> 01:11:01,200
- No, please!
- Get out of here! Get out, you...

725
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:05,200
Please, no! Please, no!

726
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:07,880
- Go on! Georgie!
- Please, no.

727
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:10,280
Where are you, Georgie?

728
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:28,160
It's over. He has found out.

729
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:31,800
Georgina? Georgina!

730
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:34,120
Georgina!

731
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:37,160
Georgie! You get out.

732
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:41,680
I'll get him to leave.

733
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:45,560
- Richard, don't get into trouble over me.
- Georgie!

734
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:51,000
- Let's go and face him.
- Don't be mad. He'll kill you!

735
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:53,320
Come quickly. Come with me.

736
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:02,040
- Wait here five minutes.
- We'll freeze to death.

737
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:06,360
He will never look in here.
Only five minutes. I will get your clothes.

738
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:09,640
Georgie, where are you?

739
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:15,600
Georgina! Georgie, where are you?

740
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:17,760
Georgie. Georgie.

741
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:21,760
You! Where is she? Where's my wife?

742
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:25,040
- What's the matter?
- You know. Fetching her cigarettes.

743
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:27,920
- Where's my wife?
- Your wife is your affair.

744
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,640
This is not a lost property office.

745
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:33,080
I want my wife! Where is she?

746
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:36,880
You! You stupid little rat.
Where's my wife? Where is she?

747
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:41,160
If you have finished,
I'll ask you to leave the kitchen.

748
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:45,160
- I have other diners to consider.
- Oh! Uh!

749
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:48,920
I'm the only diner who matters here.
I own this restaurant.

750
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:52,080
I want my wife. You've hidden her. Where is she?

751
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:55,320
God keep me calm! Where are they?

752
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:58,400
Georgina! Georgina!

753
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:02,160
- Georgina! Georgina!
- Ahh!

754
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:05,920
Georgina! Where is she, Boarst?

755
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:13,200
Boarst, where is she? Georgie! Georgie!

756
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:16,840
Georgie, you bitch!

757
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,440
Hard around.

758
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:27,320
Georgie! I want my wife!

759
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:38,080
Georgie!

760
01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:43,200
I'll bloody find her.

761
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:45,720
I'll bloody find her.

762
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:50,800
I'll find them. I'll bloody find them.
I knew it. Scheming tart!

763
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:53,520
I'll bloody find them and I'll bloody kill him!

764
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:55,560
And I'll bloody eat him!

765
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:58,280
I'll kill him and I'll eat him!

766
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:02,920
- I'll kill him and then I'll eat him.
- Oh, shit!

767
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,000
I'll eat him!

768
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:09,320
I'll eat him!

769
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:14,200
We can get you out.
Eden can drive you. Where do you want to go?

770
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:16,400
I know a place.

771
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:20,080
- What about our clothes?
- I'll get them to you. Quickly.

772
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:23,120
Quickly. Quick.

773
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:43,760
No. No. No, no.

774
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:46,800
No, please. Aah! No.

775
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:26,120
What is this place?

776
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:29,080
It's a book depository.

777
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:33,000
When my bookshop is quiet,
I do a stocktaking job.

778
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:37,440
I'm cataloguing French history.

779
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:43,560
There's a kitchen and a bathroom.

780
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:47,600
It's a bit primitive but there's an extraordinary view.

781
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:49,960
Have you read all these books?

782
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:52,080
No.

783
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:57,720
It's not necessary
for the book-keeper to read all the stock.

784
01:16:57,800 --> 01:17:00,840
With a job like this, you could be very boring.

785
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:05,280
Are we safe here?

786
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:09,720
Does Albert read?

787
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:11,760
No.

788
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:16,960
If you don't read, does that make you safe?

789
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:19,160
Only from bad books.

790
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:23,840
You could spend a lifetime in here reading.

791
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:30,200
You could. Two lifetimes - yours and mine.

792
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:32,720
- Is that what I'm in for?
- No.

793
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:41,560
What good are all these books to you?
You can't eat them.

794
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:44,360
How can they make you happy?

795
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:47,200
I've always found them very reasonable.

796
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:50,440
They don't change their minds
when you're not looking.

797
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:53,120
That sounds like a disadvantage to me.

798
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:57,560
Kiss me.

799
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:12,000
- I...

800
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:13,880
- I think perhaps...

801
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:17,320
I think perhaps we'll leave the singing.

802
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:20,360
Do you agree, until later, maybe?

803
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:26,720
How is the restaurant?

804
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:30,920
- It's all right.
- And Richard? Mr. Boarst?

805
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,160
He's fine.

806
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:37,600
Is there any more trouble,

807
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:40,560
er, like last night?

808
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:43,320
- No, sir.
- Would you like to join us?

809
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:50,440
No, thank you. I'll eat later with Mr. Boarst.

810
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:06,120
Enjoy your meal.

811
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:08,160
Thank you.

812
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:18,080
Erm, have you any other news to tell us?

813
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:24,400
Mr. Boarst says... He told me to tell you to stay put

814
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:28,000
and he wishes you bon appétit.

815
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:30,040
Thank you.

816
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:40,480
When you're finished, I'm to take the dishes back.

817
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:47,520
Oh, if you find any of those books interesting,
you can borrow them.

818
01:20:17,960 --> 01:20:20,200
Wa-woo! Di-di-di-di-dah-da!

819
01:20:29,680 --> 01:20:32,400
All right, where are they? Where are they?

820
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:35,920
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

821
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:40,560
I don't suppose you ate all this yourself.
What have we got in here? Let's see. Ah.

822
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:44,800
Fish sauce with mayonnaise
and a touch of basil. I like basil.

823
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:47,240
What else we got in here? Aha.

824
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:50,800
It's sticky. Don't tell me.
Ohocolate sauce - profiteroles.

825
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:53,800
Georgina liked profiteroles.

826
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:58,520
Oh, and serviettes
with Georgina's lipstick on them.

827
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:01,360
And a nice bottle of wine. Very nice.

828
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:04,400
He's for the chop, Richard.
I'll get my hands on him.

829
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:08,800
Leave that bread roll alone. I need to know
where they are. Where are they? Eh?

830
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:14,040
Ah. Ah. That's good.
Open your mouth. Come on, open it.

831
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:17,720
- Take an interest in your food.
- We don't need to do this.

832
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:21,080
- Getting squeamish?
- He's just a kid.

833
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:25,000
- Stand him up and get his trousers down.
- Leave him alone.

834
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:30,360
Get out. Who needs fairies like you?
And take your four-eyed cousin with you.

835
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:35,720
See how you get on in the streets without
me to wipe your noses. Get lost! Righto.

836
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:39,000
OK, button eater, tell me where they are.

837
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:45,120
OK, button eater, where are they?

838
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:50,440
We've run out of buttons.
But there is one more button.

839
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:53,800
It's your belly button.
How'd you like to swallow that?

840
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:56,040
- Albert!
- You still here?

841
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:58,880
Well, then, watch this.

842
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:11,120
Wake him up! Wake him up, wake him up.
I must find out where she is!

843
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:13,160
Wake him up!

844
01:22:14,120 --> 01:22:16,080
Wake him up!

845
01:22:17,080 --> 01:22:21,760
Where are they?
If he comes to, he better start to talk.

846
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:31,560
I got 'em!

847
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:17,240
I have brought your dinner.

848
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:27,840
Where's the kitchen lad?

849
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:31,560
- He is in hospital.
- What?

850
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:39,320
He said he told them nothing and I believe him.

851
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:43,440
- I must see him.
- I don't think that's wise.

852
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:45,480
I'm coming.

853
01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:48,760
You must take me to him.

854
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:52,080
- Start packing.
- What have we got to pack?

855
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:56,560
Richard. Richard, bring that for Pup.

856
01:23:56,640 --> 01:24:00,080
What can you do? You only endanger yourself.

857
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:03,800
I'll only be gone an hour.

858
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:06,960
Richard, you can bring me back, can't you?

859
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:12,400
Oh, poor Pup. Oh, poor Pup.

860
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:21,960
Leave me something to eat.

861
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:24,040
Of course.

862
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:28,680
Please be very careful.

863
01:25:34,280 --> 01:25:36,240
Thank you.

864
01:26:02,160 --> 01:26:04,680
Hold him by his hair.

865
01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:06,840
He hasn't got much hair to hold.

866
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:10,480
- Disgusting to be that old and to be her lover.
- Same age as you.

867
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:15,080
- I'm her husband, not her lover.
- You can only be one and not the other?

868
01:26:15,160 --> 01:26:21,520
If he'd been younger, I could've understood.
He'd just be a passing fancy. You bastard!

869
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:25,560
Right, Mitchel, now's your chance.
You are gonna chew bollocks.

870
01:26:25,640 --> 01:26:28,200
- He's too old.
- What's that mean?

871
01:26:28,280 --> 01:26:30,960
He's the same age as me - 40, almost.

872
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:33,920
If he was younger it would've been all right?

873
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:37,960
My God. When you're 17, is being 40 old?

874
01:26:38,040 --> 01:26:44,680
- He probably hasn't had a bath recently.
- God, Mitchel, you are a prize mule.

875
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:48,120
Well, I mean, certainly...

876
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:51,880
- He must've been with Georgina last night.
- No! Shut up.

877
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:54,560
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up!

878
01:26:54,640 --> 01:26:56,920
You pissing little worm.

879
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:00,920
God, you are an idiot, Mitchel.

880
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:05,120
You can be guaranteed
to say the wrong thing at the right time.

881
01:27:05,200 --> 01:27:09,480
I didn't mean that you literally
had to chew his bollocks off.

882
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:12,320
I meant it metaphorically.

883
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:14,480
What does that mean, Albert?

884
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:17,840
"Jewish Book-keeper Savaged
By Young Sex Maniac. "

885
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:21,400
I don't want this to look like a sex murder.

886
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:26,560
It's a revenge killing, an affair of the heart,
a crime passionnel.

887
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:30,040
I want no evil gossip spread around about me.

888
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:35,560
They are not going to say... They are going
to say this was a dignified revenge killing.

889
01:27:35,640 --> 01:27:37,680
They're gonna admire the style.

890
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:41,760
"He was stuffed. And Albert liked good food. "

891
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:46,080
They might even smile.
"He was stuffed with the tools of his trade. "

892
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:51,760
"He was stuffed with books.
The crummy little book-keeper was... "

893
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:56,440
Mitchel, no unnecessary... No unnecessaries.

894
01:27:57,520 --> 01:28:02,640
Finish him off! Shut his mouth, hold his nose,
ram the bloody books down his throat.

895
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:05,120
Suffocate the bastard!

896
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,080
Michael!

897
01:28:23,640 --> 01:28:25,080
Michael.

898
01:28:47,320 --> 01:28:51,840
OK, so this is how you eat the crayfish.
First, you snap off the head.

899
01:28:53,160 --> 01:28:55,160
Then you pull out the whiskers,

900
01:28:55,240 --> 01:28:57,480
then you strip off the legs.

901
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:06,000
And then you poke out the soft part of the body.

902
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:09,640
- You turn the light out?
- What light?

903
01:29:10,360 --> 01:29:14,880
Idiot. You wouldn't remember to fart.
Place might burn down with all them books.

904
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:19,440
- That would nicely destroy the evidence.
- I don't want it destroyed, idiot!

905
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:21,280
I want Georgina to see it.

906
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:23,520
What did he say?

907
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:27,640
The French Revolution
was easier to swallow than Napoleon.

908
01:30:27,720 --> 01:30:31,320
Napoleon was a prat. He threw everything away.

909
01:30:31,400 --> 01:30:36,560
Napoleon liked seafood.
His favourite dish was oysters Florentine.

910
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:39,840
It's amazing, isn't it? Churchill liked seafood.

911
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:43,680
All the great generals were keen on seafood.

912
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:46,680
What did Julius Caesar like, or Hitler?

913
01:30:46,760 --> 01:30:50,000
Hitler liked clams. And Mussolini liked squid.

914
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:52,800
- You're making it up.
- What do you know, Harris?

915
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:56,160
- What did the bookseller eat?
- You could tell from his vomit.

916
01:30:56,240 --> 01:31:00,320
What do I care what he ate?
It all comes out as shit in the end.

917
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:21,800
I'm so tired.

918
01:31:24,680 --> 01:31:26,800
I'm going to sleep.

919
01:31:41,080 --> 01:31:43,960
I've got a lot to tell you in the morning.

920
01:31:45,080 --> 01:31:47,240
And I want you to listen.

921
01:31:49,160 --> 01:31:52,600
Somebody should know.
And who can I tell but you?

922
01:31:56,760 --> 01:31:59,120
And then...

923
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:05,520
when I wake up in the morning,

924
01:32:09,640 --> 01:32:11,800
I want you to kiss me.

925
01:32:16,040 --> 01:32:18,280
And then I want breakfast.

926
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:22,960
Erm, coffee and fresh rolls and butter

927
01:32:25,400 --> 01:32:27,480
and marmalade.

928
01:32:28,440 --> 01:32:31,520
And toast.

929
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:34,720
And...

930
01:32:36,680 --> 01:32:38,760
Good night, Michael.

931
01:32:43,880 --> 01:32:46,200
I'll see you in the morning.

932
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:52,440
I love you.

933
01:32:54,080 --> 01:32:57,320
- You shouldn't have done it. It wasn't worth it.
- You what?

934
01:32:57,400 --> 01:33:01,600
Georgina wasn't worth it?
How bloody dare you say that?

935
01:33:01,680 --> 01:33:06,240
Georgina's worth a thousand
snooty little Jewish book-keeping clerks

936
01:33:06,320 --> 01:33:09,240
who masturbate over the French Revolution.

937
01:33:09,320 --> 01:33:14,360
The book-keeper will get us into trouble
and he wasn't worth it. Oalm down.

938
01:33:14,440 --> 01:33:19,640
Little circumcised mediocrity
was screwing my wife! I will not calm down!

939
01:33:19,720 --> 01:33:23,840
I've seen you, Harris, eyeing Georgina,
looking at another man's wife.

940
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:27,600
I've seen you watch her skirt fly up
when she got out of the car.

941
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:30,120
Yes, I've seen you sniffing her, Harris.

942
01:33:30,200 --> 01:33:33,560
And to think I ever trusted you with her,

943
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:37,520
that I ever trusted you to drive her home
when I was drunk.

944
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:40,440
- You get out of this restaurant!
- Oalm down.

945
01:33:40,520 --> 01:33:44,000
Mitchel, get Richard.
I want this man banned. Get out!

946
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:47,520
- If you want to shout...
- I can shout in my own restaurant!

947
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:51,360
I own this restaurant. Get out! Fuck you!

948
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:57,080
Go, you mule! Richard, I'm closing you up.

949
01:33:57,160 --> 01:34:00,880
- Really?
- You are finished, Richard.

950
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:06,160
Allowing decent people to dine
with wife snatchers. You're finished!

951
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:08,320
I think not, Mr. Spica!

952
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:13,680
And if I did, where would you eat?
Who would have you?

953
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:18,760
Now, if you'd kindly leave,
we can start clearing up the mess you have made.

954
01:34:18,840 --> 01:34:23,720
I'm warning you. Tomorrow
your restaurant will be just one big car park.

955
01:34:23,800 --> 01:34:26,240
- Nothing more.
- I wonder how you will do that.

956
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:31,280
A bulldozer, Richard.
Your cuisine will be 20 feet under brick dust.

957
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:34,640
Get out of it, Harris. You get out of it.

958
01:34:34,720 --> 01:34:38,560
Go on. I can tell loyalty when I see it.

959
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:04,640
Well, Michael,

960
01:35:06,760 --> 01:35:08,880
you didn't kiss me

961
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:12,960
so...

962
01:35:15,480 --> 01:35:18,280
I suppose I have to make my own breakfast.

963
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:23,440
Don't get up yet.

964
01:35:39,160 --> 01:35:41,200
Well, Michael,

965
01:35:44,120 --> 01:35:46,120
that's that.

966
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:50,800
Short and very sweet.

967
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:58,040
Now you're not listening,
I suppose I could tell you about Albert.

968
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:03,920
I meant to tell you eventually
but I'd have to know you better because...

969
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,520
Well, because I'd be so ashamed.

970
01:36:09,200 --> 01:36:13,560
But it's important that I tell you now
so that I can have done with it.

971
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:24,960
Albert beat me. Well, I know you know that.
You saw the bruises.

972
01:36:26,200 --> 01:36:28,400
He was regular in his habits.

973
01:36:33,680 --> 01:36:37,200
When we got back from the restaurant,
he'd make me get a hot, wet towel

974
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:39,480
and accompany him to the toilet.

975
01:36:41,560 --> 01:36:43,720
And I'd have to wipe his...

976
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:50,800
After I finished, he... he made... Oh...

977
01:36:55,120 --> 01:36:57,200
Help me, Michael.

978
01:37:00,720 --> 01:37:05,480
On his side of the bed he had
a suitcase with all kinds of objects in it.

979
01:37:05,560 --> 01:37:07,680
Er, a toothbrush,

980
01:37:09,480 --> 01:37:11,560
a wooden spoon,

981
01:37:14,920 --> 01:37:17,080
a plastic train,

982
01:37:18,360 --> 01:37:20,320
a wine bottle.

983
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:22,520
And he'd use them.

984
01:37:24,200 --> 01:37:28,720
If I didn't do it whilst he watched,
he'd insist on doing it himself.

985
01:37:30,360 --> 01:37:33,320
At least when I did it, it hurt less.

986
01:37:35,720 --> 01:37:40,520
I don't think he was very interested in sex -
not with me, not with women.

987
01:37:44,600 --> 01:37:46,720
I left him four times.

988
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:50,720
I caught the night ferry.

989
01:37:53,080 --> 01:37:57,000
He and Harris found me in Brussels,
they brought me back.

990
01:37:58,320 --> 01:38:01,400
On the boat, Albert cried, bought me presents.

991
01:38:03,480 --> 01:38:08,040
But then after we landed,
when we gotjust outside the harbour,

992
01:38:08,120 --> 01:38:10,800
before the motorway, he stopped the car

993
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:15,720
and he and Harris and Spangler dragged me out
and stripped me and beat me.

994
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:23,720
'Michael,

995
01:38:25,960 --> 01:38:28,080
'all this must finish.

996
01:38:30,080 --> 01:38:33,040
'Help me, Michael. Please. '

997
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:42,240
He's dead.

998
01:38:44,680 --> 01:38:49,680
They stuffed his mouth with paper
ripped from his favourite book.

999
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:52,640
- Could you cook him?
- Cook who, Georgina?

1000
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:56,040
Michael.

1001
01:38:56,120 --> 01:38:58,800
No. Mon dieu, non.

1002
01:39:01,480 --> 01:39:06,320
You have a reputation
for a wide range of experimental dishes.

1003
01:39:08,640 --> 01:39:11,000
He might taste good.

1004
01:39:11,080 --> 01:39:13,240
I'm sure he would taste good.

1005
01:39:13,320 --> 01:39:15,680
What would taste best?

1006
01:39:15,760 --> 01:39:18,880
His heart? His liver?

1007
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:21,600
The cheeks of his backside?

1008
01:39:21,680 --> 01:39:25,000
His prairie oysters?

1009
01:39:27,480 --> 01:39:29,560
Georgina,

1010
01:39:29,640 --> 01:39:31,640
sit down.

1011
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:34,880
Sit down.

1012
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:40,880
When you make out a menu,
how do you price each dish?

1013
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:46,640
I charge a lot for anything black.

1014
01:39:46,720 --> 01:39:50,720
Grapes, olives, blackcurrants.

1015
01:39:53,720 --> 01:39:56,560
People like to remind themselves of death,

1016
01:39:57,400 --> 01:40:01,200
eating black food is like consuming death,

1017
01:40:02,280 --> 01:40:08,800
like saying, "Death, I'm eating you. "

1018
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:12,960
Black truffles are the most expensive. And caviar.

1019
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:17,160
Death and birth.

1020
01:40:18,400 --> 01:40:21,120
The end and the beginning.

1021
01:40:22,360 --> 01:40:27,360
Don't you think it's appropriate
that the most expensive items are black?

1022
01:40:31,040 --> 01:40:33,280
We also charge for vanity.

1023
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:37,200
Diet foods have an additional surcharge

1024
01:40:38,560 --> 01:40:40,880
of 30%.

1025
01:40:41,720 --> 01:40:44,520
Aphrodisiacs, 50%.

1026
01:40:44,600 --> 01:40:49,560
And from what I saw,
your lover did not need an aphrodisiac.

1027
01:40:50,440 --> 01:40:54,160
What did you see? I want to know.

1028
01:40:55,280 --> 01:40:57,240
Nobody knew but you.

1029
01:40:58,160 --> 01:41:01,520
Everyone pitied me. Even you pitied me.

1030
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:05,360
And how can I know that he loved me
if there were no witnesses?

1031
01:41:06,640 --> 01:41:11,640
If you loved him, that does not seem
to be a very necessary question.

1032
01:41:11,720 --> 01:41:14,720
Yes, it does! Tell me what you know!

1033
01:41:17,840 --> 01:41:20,720
What I saw was what you let me see.

1034
01:41:23,200 --> 01:41:25,160
Of course it was.

1035
01:41:26,040 --> 01:41:30,480
How could I know that it was real
unless someone else was watching?

1036
01:41:32,760 --> 01:41:34,880
Tell me what you saw.

1037
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:38,080
Or are you ashamed to tell me?

1038
01:41:41,720 --> 01:41:43,880
No.

1039
01:41:43,960 --> 01:41:46,240
I saw him kissing you

1040
01:41:48,280 --> 01:41:50,320
on the mouth,

1041
01:41:52,400 --> 01:41:54,440
on the neck,

1042
01:41:55,240 --> 01:41:57,320
behind your ear.

1043
01:42:00,920 --> 01:42:03,240
I saw him undressing you.

1044
01:42:07,680 --> 01:42:09,880
I saw him kissing your breasts.

1045
01:42:13,640 --> 01:42:17,360
I saw him put his hand between your legs.

1046
01:42:19,680 --> 01:42:21,960
And what did you see me do?

1047
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:27,600
I saw you kiss him on the mouth.

1048
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:35,960
I saw you lying under him on the floor of the pantry.

1049
01:42:39,320 --> 01:42:42,440
I saw him take you from behind.

1050
01:42:46,920 --> 01:42:50,600
I saw you take his penis in your mouth.

1051
01:42:53,720 --> 01:42:56,000
I saw you...

1052
01:43:12,400 --> 01:43:14,920
Do lovers always behave like that?

1053
01:43:19,680 --> 01:43:22,680
My parents behaved like that.

1054
01:43:22,760 --> 01:43:24,720
They did?

1055
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:29,080
- You saw them?
- And lovers in the cinema behave like that.

1056
01:43:29,160 --> 01:43:31,200
No, that doesn't count.

1057
01:43:31,280 --> 01:43:36,040
And in my fantasies,
lovers always behave like that.

1058
01:43:36,120 --> 01:43:38,800
Were you jealous?

1059
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:41,000
Did we make you jealous?

1060
01:43:42,240 --> 01:43:44,360
Did you want to join us?

1061
01:43:45,440 --> 01:43:48,880
- If you did, help me now.
- Georgina, no.

1062
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:54,120
In memory of us making love in your kitchen
and in your fantasies, help me now.

1063
01:43:54,200 --> 01:43:56,760
No.

1064
01:43:56,840 --> 01:44:00,800
In memory of your parents making love,
help me now.

1065
01:44:00,880 --> 01:44:02,840
Georgina, no!

1066
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:06,280
People I like learn my name too late.

1067
01:44:07,720 --> 01:44:09,880
Too late?

1068
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:13,160
Cook Michael for me.

1069
01:44:13,240 --> 01:44:15,200
No.

1070
01:44:16,240 --> 01:44:18,800
This was his favourite restaurant.

1071
01:44:19,760 --> 01:44:21,800
It's also mine.

1072
01:44:22,760 --> 01:44:24,840
ook Michael for me.

1073
01:44:26,280 --> 01:44:29,040
If I did,

1074
01:44:29,120 --> 01:44:32,000
who would ever eat here again?

1075
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,280
How can I make you change your mind?

1076
01:44:41,680 --> 01:44:45,240
Do you want to make love with me?
You can do what he did.

1077
01:44:48,840 --> 01:44:51,040
How can I persuade you?

1078
01:44:51,800 --> 01:44:54,080
You can't. You may have loved him...

1079
01:44:54,160 --> 01:44:56,640
You know I did, you saw me.

1080
01:44:58,160 --> 01:45:01,080
But you don't have to eat him, Georgina.

1081
01:45:01,160 --> 01:45:05,720
Do you... do you have some idea
that by eating him

1082
01:45:05,800 --> 01:45:08,160
he can become part of you?

1083
01:45:08,240 --> 01:45:12,560
You can't believe that by eating him
you can always be together!

1084
01:45:13,480 --> 01:45:15,600
I'm not eating him.

1085
01:45:18,560 --> 01:45:21,440
- Albert is.
- Albert?

1086
01:45:26,040 --> 01:45:28,480
There's £11,000. It's Michael's.

1087
01:45:35,720 --> 01:45:37,880
Put your money away.

1088
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:46,480
Where is he?

1089
01:47:27,880 --> 01:47:29,960
What's going on here?

1090
01:47:30,040 --> 01:47:34,080
Why do I suddenly have to come in
to my own restaurant like a stranger?

1091
01:47:34,160 --> 01:47:36,240
Special invitations.

1092
01:47:37,240 --> 01:47:40,520
Which I might say
could've gone to a better printer.

1093
01:47:40,600 --> 01:47:43,200
I have to bang on the door like an outcast.

1094
01:47:44,920 --> 01:47:46,880
Well, well, well.

1095
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:51,880
Georgina Duckles.
What brings you here, you bitch?

1096
01:47:52,720 --> 01:47:56,160
I'm very surprised
you show your face here, you slut.

1097
01:47:56,240 --> 01:47:59,960
Where you been? Albert has been frantic.

1098
01:48:00,040 --> 01:48:02,560
Shut up, Grace. Find me a drink.

1099
01:48:02,640 --> 01:48:06,720
- Happy anniversary, Albert.
- I'll bloody kill you for what you did!

1100
01:48:06,800 --> 01:48:10,280
- You should find that easy.
- Don't think I'm taking you back.

1101
01:48:10,360 --> 01:48:12,440
I'll make you pay, you slut.

1102
01:48:12,520 --> 01:48:16,000
Your bottom's going to be
very, very sore for weeks.

1103
01:48:17,040 --> 01:48:21,200
No more books for you, girl.
You're staying in under lock and key.

1104
01:48:21,280 --> 01:48:25,800
There's going to be no more books
or prick-sniffing for you, girl.

1105
01:48:27,200 --> 01:48:29,520
Happy anniversary, Albert.

1106
01:48:29,600 --> 01:48:33,280
What are you talking about? It's not my birthday.

1107
01:48:33,360 --> 01:48:39,720
No, but it's an anniversary that I shall
always celebrate, even if you won't. And you won't.

1108
01:48:39,800 --> 01:48:44,360
- What? Where is everybody?
- They'll be here presently.

1109
01:48:44,440 --> 01:48:47,040
- Look, Georgina.
- What?

1110
01:48:47,120 --> 01:48:50,600
- It's all over now.
- What is?

1111
01:48:50,680 --> 01:48:53,920
- Grace, just go and look out of a window.
- Oh.

1112
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,320
Mitchel, bugger off out of it.

1113
01:48:56,400 --> 01:48:59,360
Look, Georgina, when the others arrive...

1114
01:48:59,440 --> 01:49:02,400
Where are they? The invitation says nine o'clock.

1115
01:49:02,480 --> 01:49:05,960
- Where are they gonna sit?
- They'll be here presently.

1116
01:49:06,040 --> 01:49:09,920
Look, Georgina, you didn't...
didn't really like him, did you?

1117
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:15,000
I mean, how could you like
a bloody book-keeper, a nobody?

1118
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:20,560
I tell you what. I'll try... We'll forget it, eh?

1119
01:49:21,360 --> 01:49:23,920
Eh? Come home with me.

1120
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:28,200
Tell you the truth, Georgie,
I've been a bit miserable.

1121
01:49:28,280 --> 01:49:32,240
- Since it is your anniversary...
- What bloody anniversary?

1122
01:49:32,320 --> 01:49:34,280
I've brought you a present.

1123
01:49:34,360 --> 01:49:37,920
I don't need presents.
It's me who gives you presents.

1124
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:41,600
Besides, you've never had
the money to give me presents.

1125
01:49:41,680 --> 01:49:44,000
And Richard has cooked it for you.

1126
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:47,600
- Under my instructions.
- Oh?

1127
01:49:47,680 --> 01:49:49,680
Knowing how you like to eat.

1128
01:49:50,680 --> 01:49:53,320
Knowing how you like to gorge yourself.

1129
01:49:54,440 --> 01:49:57,560
And we've brought a few of your friends around.

1130
01:51:01,240 --> 01:51:03,920
What sort of party is this, Georgie?

1131
01:51:05,560 --> 01:51:08,960
- What's going on?
- Sit down, Albert.

1132
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,120
Can't I sit down, Georgina?

1133
01:51:12,200 --> 01:51:14,560
No, this is Albert's special treat.

1134
01:51:16,600 --> 01:51:22,200
- Here, I'm not eating with that Roy there.
- Shut up, Albert.

1135
01:51:24,120 --> 01:51:26,440
You're here to enjoy yourself.

1136
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:38,960
Georgie.

1137
01:51:54,720 --> 01:51:56,880
Jesus!

1138
01:51:56,960 --> 01:51:58,400
God.

1139
01:52:02,320 --> 01:52:05,800
No, it's not God, Albert. It's Michael.

1140
01:52:07,440 --> 01:52:09,400
My lover.

1141
01:52:10,360 --> 01:52:13,320
You vowed you would kill him, and you did.

1142
01:52:15,240 --> 01:52:17,520
And you vowed you would eat him.

1143
01:52:19,160 --> 01:52:21,400
Now eat him.

1144
01:52:23,200 --> 01:52:25,280
What's the matter?

1145
01:52:25,360 --> 01:52:28,960
You have your knife and fork.
You do know how to use them.

1146
01:52:29,080 --> 01:52:33,280
Or have all those carefully-learnt table manners
gone to waste?

1147
01:52:43,920 --> 01:52:46,480
Mitchel can pour you a drink.

1148
01:52:53,600 --> 01:52:56,200
Your waiter has opted out.

1149
01:52:56,280 --> 01:52:59,120
Er, Grace will pour for you.

1150
01:52:59,200 --> 01:53:01,160
Oh.

1151
01:53:04,200 --> 01:53:06,400
- Non, monsieur!
- Yah!

1152
01:53:24,120 --> 01:53:26,560
Eat, Albert.

1153
01:53:27,840 --> 01:53:30,160
Roy, pour Albert a drink.

1154
01:54:05,520 --> 01:54:10,000
Try the cock, Albert. It's a delicacy.

1155
01:54:10,880 --> 01:54:13,200
And you know where it's been.

1156
01:54:48,040 --> 01:54:50,160
Go on, Albert.

1157
01:54:51,080 --> 01:54:53,040
Eat.

1158
01:55:10,120 --> 01:55:12,160
Bon appétit.

1159
01:55:14,480 --> 01:55:16,520
It's French.

1160
01:55:42,560 --> 01:55:44,520
Cannibal.

1161
01:55:45,520 --> 01:55:55,520
