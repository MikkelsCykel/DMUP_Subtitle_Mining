Hello, Helen... I' d almost
forgotten you work here

2
00:02:13,525 --> 00:02:16,046
I know, I know, you'd almost
forgotten I work here...

3
00:02:16,149 --> 00:02:19,282
but I swear I was up all night toying
with ideas for the fashion show...

4
00:02:19,381 --> 00:02:21,072
...and I've really hit
on something. You see...

5
00:02:24,053 --> 00:02:24,882
What?

6
00:02:29,621 --> 00:02:32,438
I took four bottles of vodka on Friday,
it was my birthday, you know that

7
00:02:32,533 --> 00:02:35,403
I was having a party and I was
running late, so I borrowed some

8
00:02:35,509 --> 00:02:37,168
I bought some more to replace it

9
00:02:37,269 --> 00:02:39,725
Not a lot of use to me when
I had nothing to offer the executives

10
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,292
who dropped by late Friday

11
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:44,975
Off the top of my head, you could
have told them you'd run out

12
00:02:45,078 --> 00:02:47,184
It's, it's popular stuff

13
00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:50,319
Bullshit, bullshit... We're in PR.
That's what we do, isn't it?

14
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,214
But you didn't do that,
did you, Paul?

15
00:02:56,022 --> 00:02:56,948
No

16
00:02:58,005 --> 00:03:00,014
So I'm out... am I?

17
00:03:05,204 --> 00:03:06,580
Well, this is just perfect

18
00:03:07,796 --> 00:03:10,450
Congratulations. You've wanted me
out for ages, now you've done it.

19
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:12,011
Very well done

20
00:03:14,838 --> 00:03:17,905
For theft. Pretty foolproof

21
00:03:18,004 --> 00:03:21,487
Okay, I'll go... I'll go

22
00:03:21,588 --> 00:03:24,436
I was getting a bit choked up with all
the testosterone flying about the place

23
00:03:24,532 --> 00:03:26,605
Best I get out before
I start growing a penis

24
00:03:29,013 --> 00:03:31,347
Oh! Told you... lesbian

25
00:03:46,387 --> 00:03:49,738
I really didn't think it'd be
so easy to crack, did you?

26
00:03:49,844 --> 00:03:51,273
No
Oops

27
00:03:53,716 --> 00:03:54,894
Thank you

28
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:05,010
District Line information.
Due to a derailment at Victoria...

29
00:06:05,107 --> 00:06:07,475
...District Line trains are
subject to extensive delay

30
00:06:07,571 --> 00:06:10,256
We suggest you find
alternative means of transport

31
00:06:40,593 --> 00:06:43,409
Are you all right, love?
Oh, it's a bit of a nasty cut

32
00:06:44,241 --> 00:06:45,802
Might need a couple of stitches...
Come on

33
00:06:56,338 --> 00:06:58,574
Oh-oh... Ah, Beatles' lyrics, eh?

34
00:06:58,672 --> 00:06:59,503
What?

35
00:06:59,602 --> 00:07:02,602
'Elastic Thrombosis'.
They're guilty of lyric poaching

36
00:07:02,706 --> 00:07:04,136
They're Beatles' lyrics,
aren't they?

37
00:07:04,241 --> 00:07:05,802
I don't know, sorry

38
00:07:06,673 --> 00:07:07,567
Of course you do. Come on,
everyone is born knowing all

39
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:08,778
the Beatles' lyrics instinctively

40
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,663
They're passed into the foetus subconsciously
along with all the amniotic stuff

41
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,111
In fact, they should be called
'The Foetles'

42
00:07:18,832 --> 00:07:20,426
Not a fan, clearly

43
00:07:41,617 --> 00:07:43,691
It's funny the way nobody
talks on the tubes, isn't it?

44
00:07:44,466 --> 00:07:46,987
I mean, I rarely catch
the tube myself but, er... or lifts

45
00:07:47,985 --> 00:07:50,125
Confined spaces,
everybody shuts down. Why is that?

46
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:53,643
Perhaps we think everyone else
in the tube or the lift

47
00:07:53,745 --> 00:07:54,989
is a potential psychopath
or a drunk...

48
00:07:55,089 --> 00:07:57,327
...so we close down and pretend
to... read a book or something

49
00:07:57,425 --> 00:07:59,401
You've got a terrible tea stain
on your book

50
00:07:59,505 --> 00:08:02,572
Look, I don't think you're a psychopath.
I just want to read my book

51
00:08:02,672 --> 00:08:04,266
I, I understand. I apologise

52
00:08:05,809 --> 00:08:09,127
I'm in a little bit of a good mood
today as a matter of fact so I'll just

53
00:08:09,233 --> 00:08:10,314
...sorry

54
00:08:12,305 --> 00:08:13,798
Have we met before?

55
00:08:13,904 --> 00:08:17,289
No, no, honestly, honestly,
I'm, you... you seem familiar

56
00:08:17,393 --> 00:08:18,822
I don't think so

57
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,645
Yes... Yes, you were
in the lift just now

58
00:08:22,161 --> 00:08:23,591
You dropped your earring,
I picked it up

59
00:08:24,528 --> 00:08:26,732
Oh yes, you did... Thank you

60
00:08:26,832 --> 00:08:28,110
Pleasure

61
00:08:28,881 --> 00:08:30,058
Do you work there?

62
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,616
I did do but I've just
been fired. Okay?

63
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,848
Oh no, that's... that's horrible,
I'm sorry

64
00:08:36,944 --> 00:08:38,833
It's okay, you didn't do it

65
00:08:38,928 --> 00:08:42,955
I thank you for your concern and glad
you're in a good mood, et cetera

66
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:46,188
I thank you for picking up my earring
but... I just want to read my book

67
00:08:58,927 --> 00:09:01,711
Well, I get off at this stop.
I'm only telling you in case

68
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:02,887
you get off at this stop, too...

69
00:09:02,991 --> 00:09:04,269
...and you get up before me
and then I get up and you think

70
00:09:04,368 --> 00:09:05,230
I'm following you which I'm not

71
00:09:05,329 --> 00:09:07,916
I mean, I wouldn't. I mean...

72
00:09:08,624 --> 00:09:09,573
...you know

73
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,328
I really didn't mean any offence.
Please forgive me

74
00:09:14,191 --> 00:09:16,462
I'm really not a nutcase...
I apologise

75
00:09:23,088 --> 00:09:25,870
Excuse me. Um, I'm sorry

76
00:09:26,511 --> 00:09:29,710
I, I'm sure you're not a nutcase or a
psycho or anything, it's just that, um

77
00:09:29,808 --> 00:09:33,934
...I'm not, I'm not that good at,
um... you know, um...

78
00:09:35,663 --> 00:09:37,868
Constructing sentences?

79
00:09:37,968 --> 00:09:38,982
Anyway...

80
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:40,646
I'm James

81
00:09:41,551 --> 00:09:42,500
Helen

82
00:09:50,446 --> 00:09:52,586
I never figured out
why we didn't make it, Gerry

83
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:56,042
You went back to America, remember?
I couldn't afford the bus fares

84
00:09:56,143 --> 00:09:57,388
I came back though

85
00:09:59,054 --> 00:10:03,497
Turn my back for three lousy years and you
callously ditch me for another woman

86
00:10:04,335 --> 00:10:07,086
Mmm, I know, I suppose
I'm just naturally impetuous

87
00:10:08,111 --> 00:10:11,178
I live with someone. A man.
I live with a man

88
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:12,359
Really?

89
00:10:12,784 --> 00:10:16,101
Mmm! I have people consider soul mates
who don't confide in me this much

90
00:10:16,207 --> 00:10:20,649
And what would he say if he knew you were
walking up from the tube in broad daylight

91
00:10:20,751 --> 00:10:21,831
...with a complete stranger?
Mmm, big deal

92
00:10:27,887 --> 00:10:30,309
Well, it was nice to meet you,
Helen... Sorry about your job, really

93
00:10:30,415 --> 00:10:32,620
I suppose being a Gemini
can have its down sides

94
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,878
Hey, remember what
the Monty Python boys say?

95
00:10:36,654 --> 00:10:38,728
What..."Always look
on the bright side of life"?

96
00:10:39,503 --> 00:10:42,156
No..."Nobody expects
the Spanish Inquisition"

97
00:11:35,854 --> 00:11:37,098
What?

98
00:11:48,845 --> 00:11:50,887
I didn't think you liked Elton John

99
00:11:52,397 --> 00:11:53,991
I, I do, I do sometimes

100
00:12:04,813 --> 00:12:07,432
You really shouldn't just stop like that.
Set a woman back three days

101
00:12:07,534 --> 00:12:09,356
doing a thing like that

102
00:12:12,174 --> 00:12:13,418
Who is she?

103
00:12:14,732 --> 00:12:16,140
She's Lydia

104
00:12:29,006 --> 00:12:30,315
Well, I've had a dreadful day

105
00:12:31,085 --> 00:12:34,436
I got sacked.
And so did you it would seem

106
00:12:36,684 --> 00:12:37,929
Cup of tea?

107
00:12:38,798 --> 00:12:39,813
That'd be nice

108
00:12:41,195 --> 00:12:44,045
You bastard! You bastard!

109
00:12:44,141 --> 00:12:46,410
You useless shagging bastard!

110
00:12:54,253 --> 00:12:59,438
I come home and catch you up to
your nuts in Lady Shagging Godiva

111
00:13:00,365 --> 00:13:05,035
I am working all hours to support you while
you are supposedly writing your first novel

112
00:13:07,758 --> 00:13:09,513
How long?
Huh?

113
00:13:11,564 --> 00:13:13,508
Do you love her?

114
00:13:14,988 --> 00:13:16,581
No, don't tell me,
I'm not interested

115
00:13:18,733 --> 00:13:22,891
I'm only asking because I need
to know exactly how big a mug I am

116
00:13:24,492 --> 00:13:26,696
Look, er... Iook...

117
00:14:33,228 --> 00:14:34,602
Hello?
Helen? Is that you?

118
00:14:34,699 --> 00:14:39,459
No, it's your bit of stuff.
Wednesday... shag day, remember?

119
00:14:47,435 --> 00:14:49,192
Have you just got up, you lazy git?

120
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:51,627
Er, no. Er... well I, er...

121
00:14:52,363 --> 00:14:54,251
...I didn't sleep that well
last night and then, er...

122
00:14:55,787 --> 00:14:58,953
you know when you left I kind
of... I went into a really, er...

123
00:14:59,051 --> 00:15:02,664
...a really, really deep, deep,
er, deep, deep sleep

124
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:06,503
And, er... I think I might be, er, coming,
coming down with, er... anyway, er

125
00:15:07,148 --> 00:15:08,839
...what are you doing home
at this time of...

126
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,961
Oh my God, what happened to you?

127
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:18,819
Well, it depends.
Which story do you want first?

128
00:15:18,924 --> 00:15:20,068
What?

129
00:15:20,171 --> 00:15:23,020
Well... I got mugged. And...

130
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:27,874
What are you doing?

131
00:15:29,515 --> 00:15:30,977
I can't stand Elton John.
You know that

132
00:15:32,939 --> 00:15:35,907
Well, anyway... listen, tell me...

133
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:37,572
...what happened?
What happened to your head?

134
00:15:38,411 --> 00:15:40,802
Well, I got mugged
and sacked only not in that order

135
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:42,433
Although it wasn't an actual mugging,
it was only an attempted mugging

136
00:15:42,538 --> 00:15:43,466
according to the policeman...

137
00:15:43,562 --> 00:15:45,833
...because they didn't...

138
00:15:45,931 --> 00:15:47,753
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...
wait a sec, wait a sec.

139
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:48,996
Come here... Come here

140
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,672
Now sit down. Just sit here. Okay?

141
00:15:54,474 --> 00:15:59,211
Now... now you're in shock, darling,
okay. You've had a bit of

142
00:15:59,306 --> 00:16:00,680
a little bit of a shock. Okay?
Now just relax

143
00:16:03,114 --> 00:16:04,871
Um... do you want a brandy?

144
00:16:06,282 --> 00:16:07,777
It's four in the afternoon

145
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:09,346
Of course it is... sorry

146
00:16:10,634 --> 00:16:11,944
Gerry!

147
00:16:13,002 --> 00:16:14,376
Are you okay?

148
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:17,737
Me? I'm fine... Um, I'm fine.
I'm just... No, anyway, anyway

149
00:16:18,283 --> 00:16:19,973
Tell, tell, tell me what happened

150
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,938
And I just couldn't help
thinking...

151
00:16:48,042 --> 00:16:51,589
if I had just caught that bloody
train it would never have happened

152
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:53,600
I'd have been home ages ago

153
00:16:53,705 --> 00:16:57,504
Oh, well, you don't want to go
wondering about things like that

154
00:16:57,608 --> 00:17:00,479
You know, um,'if only this',
and 'what if that'. I mean...

155
00:17:04,297 --> 00:17:05,727
It's done now

156
00:17:06,921 --> 00:17:08,002
Come on

157
00:17:09,417 --> 00:17:10,530
Follow

158
00:17:11,721 --> 00:17:12,900
Splash

159
00:17:13,002 --> 00:17:14,758
I'm going to take you out...

160
00:17:14,857 --> 00:17:17,705
and get you alarmingly out of
your head on Grolsch and then...

161
00:17:17,801 --> 00:17:20,290
Dry
Thank you

162
00:17:20,392 --> 00:17:22,980
Um, and then follow, follow,
follow, follow, follow...

163
00:17:23,753 --> 00:17:25,576
and then when you've sung all your
favourite Barbra Streisand songs

164
00:17:25,673 --> 00:17:26,918
at the top of your voice...

165
00:17:27,017 --> 00:17:29,189
and got us slung out of the pub...

166
00:17:30,729 --> 00:17:31,939
Ah, here we are. Yeah, put this on

167
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,425
I'm going to let you have intimate
carnal knowledge of a Lamb Passanda

168
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:37,254
...which I know your diet
does not allow, with a...

169
00:17:37,354 --> 00:17:39,591
...double Tarka Dahl
which you can then, er...

170
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:41,152
...puke up all over the, er...
pristine doorstep of Herr

171
00:17:41,256 --> 00:17:42,239
and Frau Goebbels next door and...

172
00:17:42,344 --> 00:17:44,801
I'll help you

173
00:17:46,282 --> 00:17:47,874
Oh, I love you, Gerry

174
00:17:48,425 --> 00:17:50,793
Gerry! She's not here!

175
00:17:50,889 --> 00:17:53,606
Anna, you're Helen's best friend.
I mean, where else would she be?

176
00:17:53,703 --> 00:17:55,614
Come in and search the place
if you want. She's not here, Gerry

177
00:17:55,721 --> 00:18:00,906
What is it you've done anyway? It can't be
that nice if she's walked out on you

178
00:18:01,001 --> 00:18:03,391
Okay, look, I, I'm sorry.
Look, if she comes here...

179
00:18:03,496 --> 00:18:06,214
...just let me know or, or get her
to ring me or, or something

180
00:18:06,313 --> 00:18:08,005
That's all I ask

181
00:18:08,104 --> 00:18:10,210
Like you say, Gerry,
I'm Helen's best friend

182
00:18:10,312 --> 00:18:12,320
If she comes here
I'll do what she asks

183
00:18:38,249 --> 00:18:40,836
Well, she's got a point...
You can't stand Elton John

184
00:18:40,936 --> 00:18:43,687
Russell, forget about Elton John.
That's not the issue. What do I do?

185
00:18:43,784 --> 00:18:44,766
Gerry...

186
00:18:44,872 --> 00:18:46,696
you've been telling me for weeks
you couldn't hack it juggling

187
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,036
between Helen and Lydia...

188
00:18:48,136 --> 00:18:50,308
...and you wish you hadn't
got involved with her again

189
00:18:50,408 --> 00:18:51,205
I know

190
00:18:51,304 --> 00:18:53,443
And you didn't think you were
cut out for infidelity

191
00:18:53,544 --> 00:18:54,340
I know

192
00:18:54,439 --> 00:18:57,059
But you couldn't end it with Lydia,
'cause you weren't sure how she'd take it

193
00:18:58,409 --> 00:19:01,793
And I told you that something
if you remember my words,

194
00:19:01,896 --> 00:19:03,806
something 'ungoverned by you'
would happen...

195
00:19:03,912 --> 00:19:06,084
...to bring the situation to a head

196
00:19:07,368 --> 00:19:09,058
And... something has

197
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:16,093
It's not funny actually, Russell

198
00:19:16,649 --> 00:19:18,625
No, I'm sorry, old man...
I beg to differ

199
00:19:19,239 --> 00:19:21,444
It is funny.
It's very, very, very funny

200
00:19:22,984 --> 00:19:25,123
And look at you, it's not as though
you're rushing frantically

201
00:19:25,223 --> 00:19:26,719
about the place trying to find her

202
00:19:26,824 --> 00:19:28,318
I went to Anna's. She wasn't there

203
00:19:28,424 --> 00:19:32,166
Oh, you went to Anna's. Boy,
you're a one man SAS crack unit

204
00:19:34,248 --> 00:19:36,484
You want my opinion?

205
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:38,078
Will I like it?

206
00:19:38,183 --> 00:19:40,639
Well, of course not...
It'll be based on reality

207
00:19:49,287 --> 00:19:51,558
No, no, no. You don't advertise
a new restaurant. It's very uncool

208
00:19:52,742 --> 00:19:54,631
It's word of mouth... People talk

209
00:19:55,206 --> 00:19:58,688
And how do these people who talk know where
you are so that they can talk about you?

210
00:19:59,271 --> 00:20:01,509
Hey, listen, it's your restaurant,
Clive. I just want it to work

211
00:20:01,608 --> 00:20:03,332
Helen

212
00:20:03,431 --> 00:20:07,395
Hello, James. Rather annoying
chatty bloke on the tube

213
00:20:08,423 --> 00:20:09,830
Oh yes, hi

214
00:20:10,151 --> 00:20:12,935
You look all stressed up
with nowhere to go

215
00:20:13,031 --> 00:20:15,453
It's only a job,
you'll get another one

216
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:17,732
No, it's something else, isn't it?

217
00:20:17,831 --> 00:20:20,766
You know sometimes it helps
to just say whatever it is out loud

218
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:23,908
Of course it also helps if people
just mind their own business

219
00:20:24,007 --> 00:20:25,413
and leave you alone. I'm sorry

220
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:28,612
When I left you at the tube earlier,
I went home and found my boyfriend...

221
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:29,954
...in bed with another woman. Shit!

222
00:20:30,055 --> 00:20:34,760
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's... I mean, what an idiot

223
00:20:35,494 --> 00:20:37,153
It's okay, you weren't to know

224
00:20:37,255 --> 00:20:39,111
No, not me, your boyfriend.
He's an idiot

225
00:20:41,191 --> 00:20:43,297
Sorry, it's not my place

226
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:45,476
It's okay

227
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,128
Well, look, if it makes you feel any better,
you see that bloke over there?

228
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:52,421
Not only does he own a personalised
matching set of crocodile skin luggage...

229
00:20:52,518 --> 00:20:54,592
...but his favourite TV programme
is'Baywatch'

230
00:20:55,749 --> 00:20:57,507
So you see there's always someone
sadder than you

231
00:21:00,423 --> 00:21:01,535
Do you love him?

232
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:05,278
No, I could never
love a 'Baywatch' fan

233
00:21:07,078 --> 00:21:10,340
Hey, you did a joke in the midst
of your turbulent emotional state

234
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:12,294
That's very positive

235
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,786
Listen, you decide you want
company we're over here... Okay?

236
00:21:17,446 --> 00:21:18,559
I'm really sorry, Helen

237
00:21:31,399 --> 00:21:34,749
Two of your most disgustingly
large Grolsches, please...

238
00:21:34,854 --> 00:21:38,019
...and a large Jack Daniels
with ice, and I'll have the same

239
00:21:42,917 --> 00:21:45,122
You're behind. Can we have another?

240
00:21:48,805 --> 00:21:50,083
Fifteen?

241
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:18,182
Gerry came looking for you

242
00:22:18,278 --> 00:22:19,488
Is it what I think?

243
00:22:20,485 --> 00:22:21,915
Depends

244
00:22:22,021 --> 00:22:26,278
Is what you think that I walked in on him
shagging 'Lydia' in my bed and I walked out?

245
00:22:27,334 --> 00:22:28,480
Pretty much

246
00:22:28,838 --> 00:22:30,497
Then, yes

247
00:22:44,741 --> 00:22:45,757
Oh, hold up... hold up

248
00:22:47,108 --> 00:22:49,313
This morning was sensational

249
00:22:49,412 --> 00:22:51,356
Oh, I can't...
sorry, I can't hear you

250
00:22:51,461 --> 00:22:52,890
I can't hear you

251
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:54,404
Gerry, can you hear me?

252
00:22:54,501 --> 00:22:55,330
Didn't know it was on

253
00:22:55,428 --> 00:22:57,339
Ready, steady, go!

254
00:23:00,004 --> 00:23:00,953
I'll see you, Clive

255
00:23:05,924 --> 00:23:07,135
Who's that?

256
00:23:07,237 --> 00:23:08,382
My friend

257
00:23:10,628 --> 00:23:13,018
Come on, you... Let's get you home.
You drunken eejit

258
00:23:15,748 --> 00:23:16,992
And again

259
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,520
Come along

260
00:23:21,347 --> 00:23:22,810
Can I give you a lift anywhere?

261
00:23:22,916 --> 00:23:25,666
Er... yeah.
That, that'll be great, thank you

262
00:23:25,763 --> 00:23:27,904
Oh, hands up
if you drank too much, eh?

263
00:23:29,477 --> 00:23:31,484
Hey... I'm not as drunk
as thinkle peep I am

264
00:23:31,588 --> 00:23:33,761
Put a wick in her mouth
and she'd burn for a fortnight

265
00:23:39,907 --> 00:23:42,243
Um, 9 Menlove Avenue. Thanks a lot

266
00:23:46,692 --> 00:23:47,488
French bean, some chicken,
some rice...

267
00:23:47,588 --> 00:23:49,082
...one more little Indian

268
00:23:49,187 --> 00:23:51,742
No. Oh, come on.
Really, I'll be sick

269
00:23:51,845 --> 00:23:53,535
Well, we're on schedule for that
but we've gotta move location...

270
00:23:53,635 --> 00:23:55,229
...so just don't swallow
for ten minutes

271
00:23:59,684 --> 00:24:01,279
He didn't fancy me

272
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:04,064
He, he offered us a lift.
He was just being concerned

273
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,741
Uh-huh... Well let me tell you,
if he was being that concerned about me

274
00:24:07,844 --> 00:24:09,786
...I wouldn't be helping you
into bed right now

275
00:24:11,108 --> 00:24:12,090
Am lin bed?

276
00:24:12,195 --> 00:24:14,464
Yes... You're staying with me
for a while

277
00:24:14,562 --> 00:24:16,320
Don't worry... You'll be fine

278
00:24:16,419 --> 00:24:17,849
Just fine

279
00:24:20,547 --> 00:24:23,418
There we go. There we go

280
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:33,732
Are you some peculiar, thus far
undefined breed of dickhead?

281
00:24:34,501 --> 00:24:37,436
You have two head problems

282
00:24:37,538 --> 00:24:42,144
One: That was close... Very close

283
00:24:42,754 --> 00:24:45,407
Put in layman's terms...
she nearly caught you

284
00:24:46,468 --> 00:24:50,692
And two... and this is far
more worrying than the first one

285
00:24:52,739 --> 00:24:54,780
You're talking to yourself
in the mirror again

286
00:24:57,092 --> 00:24:58,368
Really bad sign

287
00:25:13,092 --> 00:25:17,020
No, bigger sip... big, bigger sip.
Bigger sip... Don't throw up all over me

288
00:25:20,961 --> 00:25:22,872
There are no PR jobs

289
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:27,352
I'm going to need
some part-time work, Gerry

290
00:25:30,788 --> 00:25:32,511
What you need is a change of image

291
00:25:32,611 --> 00:25:36,867
Er, you know that goes back like and then like
I don't know sort of comes like slant

292
00:26:10,401 --> 00:26:13,121
No, no...
That's for you, sir

293
00:26:42,305 --> 00:26:46,562
Hey, gorgeous. What do you do when you're not
serving up 'mad cow' burgers in here, eh?

294
00:26:46,657 --> 00:26:48,064
Well now then, let me see

295
00:26:48,161 --> 00:26:49,592
I get up about seven thirty a. M...

296
00:26:49,698 --> 00:26:52,088
...make and deliver sandwiches
in the West End during the day...

297
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:54,615
...before I come here about
six o' clock and finish at midnight

298
00:26:54,721 --> 00:26:57,952
After that, if I've got any energy left,
I give my boyfriend a blow job

299
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:00,222
Would you like some mayonnaise
with that?

300
00:27:01,825 --> 00:27:02,558
You don't mean that

301
00:27:02,657 --> 00:27:04,349
I do... Really

302
00:27:05,826 --> 00:27:08,413
So... you were together two
and a half years, and...

303
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:12,217
...you've been sitting here
like suicide on a stick for a week

304
00:27:12,321 --> 00:27:14,232
Nine days, Anna

305
00:27:15,361 --> 00:27:16,605
But bollocks to him?

306
00:27:16,704 --> 00:27:21,344
Yes. I mean why hasn't he even called to see
if I'm okay to admit that he's a twat?

307
00:27:22,689 --> 00:27:24,032
"Hello, Helen, it's Gerry

308
00:27:24,129 --> 00:27:26,650
I'm a twat. Please come home,
I love you. " All that shit

309
00:27:26,752 --> 00:27:29,720
Oh, I don't care anyway Bollocks
to him. I'm over him

310
00:27:30,018 --> 00:27:31,806
Oh... you're over him

311
00:27:31,904 --> 00:27:35,201
Yes. Totally and utterly
and completely over him

312
00:27:35,297 --> 00:27:36,061
No, you're not

313
00:27:36,161 --> 00:27:36,858
I am

314
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,659
You're not

315
00:27:37,762 --> 00:27:40,763
Anna, I'm over him. What do you mean
I'm not? How do you know I'm not?

316
00:27:41,794 --> 00:27:44,063
Well, two things really

317
00:27:44,161 --> 00:27:46,583
One: You're still counting how
long you've been apart in days...

318
00:27:46,689 --> 00:27:48,445
...and probably hours and minutes

319
00:27:48,544 --> 00:27:51,743
But... the big flashing red light way of
telling you're not really over someone

320
00:27:51,841 --> 00:27:53,630
...is when you're still
reading their horoscope...

321
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:56,381
in the hope that they're going to get wiped out
in some freak napalming incident

322
00:27:56,928 --> 00:27:58,043
Smart arse

323
00:27:59,489 --> 00:28:00,417
What is he?

324
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:01,559
A wanker

325
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,284
Oh, Aries

326
00:28:04,385 --> 00:28:06,241
Aries. Aries

327
00:28:08,192 --> 00:28:11,510
Well... just shows how much I know

328
00:28:11,615 --> 00:28:15,708
With Mars your ruler in the ascendancy... you will
get wiped out in a freak napalming incident

329
00:28:15,809 --> 00:28:17,883
...and Helen says bollocks to you
This guy's very good

330
00:28:23,199 --> 00:28:25,589
You go. No, I will. No, you

331
00:28:26,336 --> 00:28:29,654
I'm not in, I'm out.
You don't know where or who with

332
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,385
Specially who with

333
00:28:32,481 --> 00:28:33,943
Quickly, go on

334
00:28:34,049 --> 00:28:36,384
I am not answering the door
like this

335
00:28:36,479 --> 00:28:39,547
Anna, please, you have to.
It won't be him anyway

336
00:28:40,128 --> 00:28:41,339
So there's no big deal, is there?

337
00:28:47,041 --> 00:28:48,949
Bollocks to him

338
00:28:49,056 --> 00:28:51,129
Bollocks to him. Bollocks to him. Bollocks to him.
Bollocks to him. Bollocks to him

339
00:28:51,233 --> 00:28:53,271
Bollocks to him

340
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:08,478
Come on. You don't drink your fatty drinks,
you'll never really achieve quality cellulite

341
00:29:10,111 --> 00:29:11,868
Haircut suits you by the way.
No, it does. It does, no gag

342
00:29:11,967 --> 00:29:17,721
Never make a joke about women's hair,
clothes or menstrual cycles, page one

343
00:29:17,823 --> 00:29:20,507
Look, James,
maybe I shouldn't be here

344
00:29:20,607 --> 00:29:23,292
I'm sorry, I'm not being fair

345
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:29,536
You know, under normal... circumstances,
et cetera... you're really nice... and funny

346
00:29:29,631 --> 00:29:32,894
My friend Anna thinks you're cute

347
00:29:32,991 --> 00:29:34,519
Wait, hold, hold

348
00:29:34,625 --> 00:29:37,920
Your friend Anna thinks I'm cute?
Your friend Anna thinks I'm cute?!

349
00:29:38,912 --> 00:29:41,499
Shit, I just blew, wait...

350
00:29:42,398 --> 00:29:44,571
Two eighty-five,
two eighty-five on the wrong girl

351
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:47,515
Helen, listen...

352
00:29:47,935 --> 00:29:50,871
sometimes we are plonked into people's lives
when they just need to be cheered up and reassured

353
00:29:50,974 --> 00:29:56,248
...and it turns out that
for some reason it's your job

354
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:57,945
We don't know why.
In your case it's my job

355
00:29:58,047 --> 00:30:00,601
But I'll be honest...

356
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:05,851
the fact that I find you... moderately attractive
just makes the job easier on my part

357
00:30:06,655 --> 00:30:10,552
My intentions are completely honourable
I have no desire to overstep the mark, seriously

358
00:30:12,382 --> 00:30:14,358
D'you prefer diamonds or sapphires?

359
00:30:14,463 --> 00:30:15,673
Sorry, nothing

360
00:30:15,774 --> 00:30:17,466
'Moderately attractive'?

361
00:30:17,567 --> 00:30:20,218
Uh-huh, I knew you were listening

362
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:23,800
Well, you know, lose the sad eyes,
the droopy mouth, I could get you an upgrade

363
00:30:25,726 --> 00:30:28,346
So... having firml y established
the ground rules...

364
00:30:28,446 --> 00:30:30,204
...what are you doing
two weeks on Saturday?

365
00:30:30,367 --> 00:30:31,478
Probably killing myself

366
00:30:31,581 --> 00:30:33,557
Excellent.
What time does that finish?

367
00:30:33,662 --> 00:30:35,037
Do you like boats?

368
00:30:37,982 --> 00:30:40,023
D'you know we haven't done that
for two months

369
00:30:40,125 --> 00:30:41,982
Don't be daft

370
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:44,798
Two months... Almost to the day

371
00:30:45,598 --> 00:30:48,468
Almost to the day? Listen to you
what are we, a survey?

372
00:30:50,013 --> 00:30:51,160
Gerry...

373
00:30:51,902 --> 00:30:55,613
...how did one of my Waterford crystal
brandy glasses get into the laundry basket?

374
00:30:56,671 --> 00:30:57,467
To the where?

375
00:30:57,567 --> 00:30:58,843
The laundry basket

376
00:31:00,285 --> 00:31:03,670
I don't know. Can I answer
questions on 70s pop music?

377
00:31:03,774 --> 00:31:07,223
Last week, when I got the sack
and I came back, am I going mad?

378
00:31:07,326 --> 00:31:10,743
But there was a bottle of brandy and two
glasses on the dressing table, wasn't there?

379
00:31:11,709 --> 00:31:13,401
I don't know.
I mean, I couldn't really say

380
00:31:13,503 --> 00:31:14,997
Well, there were, I'm sure

381
00:31:15,102 --> 00:31:17,721
Oh, hang on, no, wait a minute.
No, I, no, I could say

382
00:31:17,822 --> 00:31:20,637
There was a bottle and one glass
because if you...

383
00:31:20,732 --> 00:31:22,905
No, I'm certain there
were two glasses, Gerry

384
00:31:23,005 --> 00:31:26,782
Helen, I'm... not sure I like
where this conversation is going

385
00:31:26,878 --> 00:31:31,037
I, I told you, I couldn't sleep
so I got up in the night...

386
00:31:31,135 --> 00:31:32,509
to get a drink to
knock myself out It was still there

387
00:31:32,606 --> 00:31:33,500
in the afternoon when you got home

388
00:31:33,598 --> 00:31:36,349
I mean you had also, that day if,
if you remember had taken a blow

389
00:31:36,446 --> 00:31:38,269
to the, the, the, the head

390
00:31:39,518 --> 00:31:40,664
We'd just had a party

391
00:31:40,766 --> 00:31:43,995
Maybe one of y our mad friends
like Anna threw it there

392
00:31:45,053 --> 00:31:46,133
I mean, Jesus

393
00:31:47,199 --> 00:31:50,461
Let's, let's spoil the moment
properly, shall we?

394
00:31:50,557 --> 00:31:51,638
What are you trying to say?

395
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:54,132
Am I shagging a brandy drinker? Yes

396
00:31:54,237 --> 00:31:57,784
Gerry, ease up, will you,
for Christ's sake. I'm only asking

397
00:31:58,302 --> 00:32:02,046
Oh, no, women never ask.
No, they don't ask, they insinuate

398
00:32:02,142 --> 00:32:05,655
And you are insinuating, not very subtly,
may I add, that I am...

399
00:32:10,141 --> 00:32:11,003
Thanks

400
00:32:11,996 --> 00:32:15,293
No, no, no. No, no, no, no,
thank you, thanks

401
00:32:16,797 --> 00:32:19,035
I mean... I mean thank you...
thank you

402
00:32:20,126 --> 00:32:22,744
I mean this, you know, this,
this is the... this is the right time,

403
00:32:22,845 --> 00:32:25,181
isn't it, to address our,
our relationship, isn't it?

404
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:28,312
I mean, it's, it's, it's perfect.
Perfect moment

405
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:31,447
Gerry, for God's sakes,
I asked a simple question

406
00:32:31,548 --> 00:32:33,306
There's no need to
become Woody Allen

407
00:32:45,437 --> 00:32:48,307
Thanks, James. I'm sorry
if you had a lousy time

408
00:32:48,411 --> 00:32:49,428
Are you kidding?

409
00:32:49,532 --> 00:32:51,923
In my book getting to drink
two chocolate milkshakes

410
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:53,818
in the one sitting represents
social splendour

411
00:32:53,916 --> 00:32:55,608
It's one of the perks
of being shallow

412
00:32:56,445 --> 00:32:58,300
Take care, Helen. You'll be fine

413
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:15,993
Thank you very much

414
00:33:24,636 --> 00:33:28,347
It's amazing how you can actually learn
to despise inanimate objects...

415
00:33:28,443 --> 00:33:30,070
...like tin openers
that don't open tins...

416
00:33:30,173 --> 00:33:32,410
...egg mayonnaise and skipjack tuna

417
00:33:33,147 --> 00:33:33,880
Are you going out?

418
00:33:34,652 --> 00:33:36,115
Yeah. I was just writing you a note

419
00:33:36,221 --> 00:33:38,131
I'm off to the library.
I have some stuff to read up on

420
00:33:39,068 --> 00:33:39,735
Okay

421
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:42,580
Yeah, well... I won't be
more than a couple of hours

422
00:33:44,572 --> 00:33:46,034
Would you rather I didn't go?

423
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,929
Oh no, no, of course not. Go

424
00:33:49,564 --> 00:33:50,644
Okay, bye

425
00:34:38,235 --> 00:34:40,539
Lydia, what are you talking about?
She followed me

426
00:34:40,635 --> 00:34:42,774
I said I was going
to the library...

427
00:34:42,875 --> 00:34:45,494
...so I've come to the library,
for God's sake!

428
00:34:47,451 --> 00:34:49,556
Of course I can't come now,
I mean what if she's still lurking

429
00:34:49,658 --> 00:34:51,482
or waiting round the corner
or something?

430
00:34:53,307 --> 00:34:54,485
Lydia, I don't know
why she followed me.

431
00:34:54,587 --> 00:34:55,765
I'm not a sleuth! I have taken
two hours off work, Gerry...

432
00:34:56,379 --> 00:34:59,128
Oh, look, look, please. No, okay,
please don't get hysterical

433
00:34:59,226 --> 00:35:01,497
Don't get hysterical.
Look, I'm sorry. Okay, I'm sorry

434
00:35:01,755 --> 00:35:04,243
I've booked a hotel in Dorset.
Are we still going?

435
00:35:04,347 --> 00:35:07,447
Do you wanna cancel it? I mean,
is, is she gonna follow us there?

436
00:35:07,546 --> 00:35:09,271
Do you wanna end this Gerry
because I am...

437
00:35:09,372 --> 00:35:11,859
Yes, I, I, I mean no. I, I mean,
no, I, I don't want

438
00:35:11,962 --> 00:35:15,345
Of course we're still going.
I don't... don't, don't...

439
00:35:16,603 --> 00:35:18,228
Don't, don't, don't, don't what?

440
00:35:18,779 --> 00:35:20,088
I don't know

441
00:35:20,187 --> 00:35:23,833
Look... we're going to dorset, okay.
We're going to have a great time... and, er

442
00:35:25,819 --> 00:35:26,996
...I'll talk to you tomorrow

443
00:35:35,771 --> 00:35:39,798
Right, that's the lot.
You don't live there anymore

444
00:35:40,539 --> 00:35:41,968
Thanks for going again, Anna

445
00:35:43,481 --> 00:35:45,425
Any evidence of 'her'?

446
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:46,841
Nothing that stood out

447
00:35:50,971 --> 00:35:51,799
Hello?

448
00:35:52,634 --> 00:35:54,160
Hi, it's James. Is Helen there?

449
00:35:54,266 --> 00:35:55,445
Helen

450
00:35:57,307 --> 00:35:58,289
It's James

451
00:36:02,969 --> 00:36:04,496
Hello?

452
00:36:05,627 --> 00:36:09,043
Yes, 'tonight' tonight, you know the tonight
that comes immediately after today

453
00:36:09,818 --> 00:36:12,121
He wants to go out tonight

454
00:36:12,218 --> 00:36:13,745
Go

455
00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:15,476
Please come, it'll be a laugh

456
00:36:15,578 --> 00:36:18,066
Um... okay

457
00:36:18,746 --> 00:36:20,786
See you

458
00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:24,178
Okay?

459
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:26,289
She doesn't wanna leave here

460
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:28,217
I know

461
00:36:28,409 --> 00:36:31,575
She's really frail, James.
Do you want me to postpone my trip?

462
00:36:31,673 --> 00:36:33,134
There's another course later
in the year

463
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,151
It's only a couple of weeks.
You should go

464
00:36:35,257 --> 00:36:36,599
Are you sure?
It's not that important

465
00:36:36,698 --> 00:36:39,284
It is important. I want you to go

466
00:36:39,386 --> 00:36:40,401
Okay

467
00:36:41,306 --> 00:36:43,379
It's going to be hard to
leave this place, James, but...

468
00:36:43,481 --> 00:36:45,720
But you've still
got the London flat

469
00:36:46,458 --> 00:36:49,524
You'll be nearer the hospital and you
can get much better crack in twon

470
00:36:52,282 --> 00:36:54,071
Hey, you know
what the Monty Python boys say...

471
00:36:54,169 --> 00:36:57,401
"Nobody expects
the Spanish Inquisition", I know

472
00:36:58,169 --> 00:36:59,030
Exactly

473
00:36:59,129 --> 00:37:00,505
...sorry, let me just...

474
00:37:01,658 --> 00:37:03,514
...Lydia's becoming
more and more demanding...

475
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:05,365
and you, you feel bad because
Helen's working night and

476
00:37:05,465 --> 00:37:07,289
day to keep the money coming in

477
00:37:07,769 --> 00:37:10,639
But you've asked Helen to come on
a research trip to Dorset with you...

478
00:37:11,384 --> 00:37:15,663
knowing that she wouldn't be
able to... to cover up the fact...

479
00:37:16,218 --> 00:37:18,039
that you're really taking Lydia
And, and despite the fact that...

480
00:37:18,136 --> 00:37:20,952
Lydia gave you an 'out' on
the phone, which you didn't take...

481
00:37:21,048 --> 00:37:22,455
...you are having a moral dilemma

482
00:37:23,033 --> 00:37:25,587
Gerry... you are
a morality free zone

483
00:37:25,689 --> 00:37:28,056
If I had no morals,
would I be discussing it?

484
00:37:29,081 --> 00:37:31,929
Whose idea was this trip...
yours or Lydia's?

485
00:37:34,489 --> 00:37:36,148
You wanna get out
of this Lydia thing

486
00:37:36,249 --> 00:37:37,875
I foresee problems

487
00:37:38,264 --> 00:37:41,047
And I wouldn't mind betting you're talking
to yourself in the mirror again

488
00:37:42,936 --> 00:37:44,214
Very bad sign

489
00:37:44,313 --> 00:37:46,770
You've no compassion... None

490
00:37:46,872 --> 00:37:49,589
Why do I bother confiding in you?

491
00:37:49,687 --> 00:37:52,503
I'm your mate. I'm here to help you

492
00:37:57,754 --> 00:37:59,161
I'm here to help you

493
00:38:04,249 --> 00:38:06,388
Nobody expects
the Spanish Inquisition!

494
00:38:06,489 --> 00:38:08,726
Our chief weapon is surprise

495
00:38:08,825 --> 00:38:09,207
Surprise and fear.
Fear and surprise

496
00:38:09,305 --> 00:38:12,536
Our two, two chief weapons
are surprise and fear

497
00:38:12,633 --> 00:38:14,160
And a ruthless efficiency.
Our three...

498
00:38:14,264 --> 00:38:17,167
...three main weapons are fear,
surprise and a ruthless efficiency

499
00:38:17,784 --> 00:38:19,062
I'll come in again

500
00:38:22,585 --> 00:38:23,632
Here we go

501
00:38:26,105 --> 00:38:27,512
Pass me your plate

502
00:38:27,608 --> 00:38:29,519
How do you do, Nigel?
Very nice to meet you

503
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,976
You all right?

504
00:38:38,584 --> 00:38:40,341
I am deadly serious

505
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,678
Oh, just set up my own PR company?

506
00:38:42,777 --> 00:38:44,239
Yeah, well, why not?

507
00:38:44,345 --> 00:38:47,063
You've got the experience...
the know-how, the contacts

508
00:38:47,832 --> 00:38:49,523
You want to spend the rest of
your life working for other people?

509
00:38:50,262 --> 00:38:52,206
Hey, what's the worst
that could possibly happen?

510
00:38:52,761 --> 00:38:55,925
Um, I could fail miserably
and look like a complete tosser

511
00:38:56,023 --> 00:38:58,032
Exactly, so what is there
to worry about?

512
00:39:06,071 --> 00:39:07,861
I had a really nice time, James

513
00:39:07,959 --> 00:39:10,960
Did you? Oh, shit. Sorry,
that's against the rules, isn't it?

514
00:39:11,063 --> 00:39:13,814
Yes, it is, so just bear that
in mind in the future, would you?

515
00:39:13,911 --> 00:39:15,952
I'm getting over a major break-up

516
00:39:16,056 --> 00:39:18,326
Yeah, sorry... Won't happen again

517
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,319
Goodnight, Helen

518
00:39:30,679 --> 00:39:33,047
Hey... you know everything happens
for the best

519
00:39:33,143 --> 00:39:35,216
You'll never know if you don't try

520
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:38,386
Wear something warm on Saturday...
Can get cold on the river

521
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,175
Take care

522
00:39:57,591 --> 00:39:59,730
So, what other ideas has James
run by you?

523
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:03,379
Anna, don't do that. Don't do
'desperate mother' acting with me

524
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,716
He's a friend. Okay? A friend

525
00:40:10,102 --> 00:40:11,860
not remotely in him
No

526
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:15,382
So how come last night was the first night
since you've been here... you didn't ask

527
00:40:15,477 --> 00:40:17,334
if anyone had called
the second you walked in the door?

528
00:41:01,975 --> 00:41:03,798
You're sorry?

529
00:41:03,895 --> 00:41:07,541
You're sorry that four of the staff
here have been cut down... with food poisoning

530
00:41:07,638 --> 00:41:09,582
after eating your sandwiches?

531
00:41:10,262 --> 00:41:11,670
And before you speak, yes...

532
00:41:11,766 --> 00:41:15,183
...they all had the same sandwiches
and the same symptoms at the same time

533
00:41:16,181 --> 00:41:18,124
Are you trained
in the catering trade, may I ask?

534
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:20,757
No, actually I worked in PR
but I...

535
00:41:20,854 --> 00:41:24,368
Well, you're not doing a particularly good
PR job this morning, are you?

536
00:41:24,663 --> 00:41:28,373
Luckily for you I've convinced my
colleagues not to take the matter any further

537
00:41:28,469 --> 00:41:30,227
This time

538
00:41:30,325 --> 00:41:32,846
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have five people's work to do

539
00:41:35,158 --> 00:41:36,173
Sorry?

540
00:41:36,277 --> 00:41:38,995
Helen has been delivering
sandwiches to your office?

541
00:41:39,093 --> 00:41:41,649
Yes... And today I had reason
to summon her

542
00:41:42,614 --> 00:41:44,437
Well I made up a reason,
to be brutally honest

543
00:41:45,557 --> 00:41:48,657
She's quite pretty in a British
horsey sort of way, isn't she?

544
00:41:49,844 --> 00:41:51,252
Lydia... what are you playing at?

545
00:41:51,349 --> 00:41:53,805
Have you gone raving mad?
She's not bloody stupid, you know

546
00:41:53,909 --> 00:41:58,703
I wanted to see what the woman
you ditched me for is like

547
00:41:59,252 --> 00:42:02,221
Now, now, now, now wait a sec.
Now I did not ditch you for...

548
00:42:02,325 --> 00:42:03,602
I mean, you went back
to America for...

549
00:42:03,701 --> 00:42:07,664
I wanted to see what this girl you seem
to have no intention of leaving...

550
00:42:07,765 --> 00:42:12,022
despite the occasional pre-orgasmic
suggestion that you are...

551
00:42:12,117 --> 00:42:14,354
...has that is so unleavable

552
00:42:14,453 --> 00:42:17,453
And I have to say that I ended our
brief meeting at a bit of a loss

553
00:42:17,973 --> 00:42:19,915
Now, Lydia, don't talk like this.
Now it sounds ugly

554
00:42:20,021 --> 00:42:23,568
Now I've told you before,
I cannot leave Helen for... for...

555
00:42:25,429 --> 00:42:26,358
you know

556
00:42:26,453 --> 00:42:27,435
For me?

557
00:42:30,133 --> 00:42:32,140
Is that what
you're trying say?

558
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:35,373
You can't leave her for me?

559
00:42:36,246 --> 00:42:38,155
Well, you haven't said
you wanted that, have you?

560
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:40,237
Gerry, I'm a woman

561
00:42:40,341 --> 00:42:42,546
We don't say what we want.

562
00:42:42,645 --> 00:42:45,460
But we reserve the right to
be pissed off if we don't get it

563
00:42:45,557 --> 00:42:48,145
That's what makes us so fascinating

564
00:42:48,244 --> 00:42:49,934
And not a little bit scary

565
00:42:52,342 --> 00:42:53,389
Hello?

566
00:42:53,493 --> 00:42:56,242
Ah, Gerald Flannigan, at last

567
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:58,578
This is your kindly
Uncle Russell here

568
00:42:59,732 --> 00:43:00,528
Listen...

569
00:43:00,628 --> 00:43:03,947
...wherever you were tonight as if
we need to ask, you weren't with me

570
00:43:04,052 --> 00:43:05,743
Helen called here looking for you

571
00:43:05,844 --> 00:43:06,957
Okay

572
00:43:07,059 --> 00:43:07,824
Yeah, all right

573
00:43:07,925 --> 00:43:09,169
Okay, thanks, mate. Bye

574
00:43:10,579 --> 00:43:13,330
Oh, thank God, I was so worried.
Where have you been?

575
00:43:14,165 --> 00:43:17,132
I went to Anna's.
I needed to see a friendly face

576
00:43:18,389 --> 00:43:20,014
I've had a horrible day

577
00:43:20,117 --> 00:43:23,379
I met Cruella de Ville's
less nice sister this morning...

578
00:43:23,476 --> 00:43:25,070
...she completely deflated me

579
00:43:25,172 --> 00:43:26,798
I know

580
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:28,810
How do you know?

581
00:43:28,915 --> 00:43:32,299
Oh, no, I mean I can tell.
Jesus, you look terrible

582
00:43:38,292 --> 00:43:40,748
Where were you earlier?
I really needed to talk to you

583
00:43:41,716 --> 00:43:45,712
Oh, I had some stuff to read up on
so I went to the library

584
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:48,624
God, you're always at the library

585
00:43:49,972 --> 00:43:51,914
I'm sich of waiting on tables

586
00:43:52,308 --> 00:43:55,090
I know when you finish the book
we'll be millionaires but...

587
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:58,479
...when are you going to finish it?

588
00:44:00,243 --> 00:44:01,673
I'm going to finish it
very soon, Helen

589
00:44:03,764 --> 00:44:05,008
Very soon

590
00:44:07,892 --> 00:44:10,958
Helen, there's something
I want to tell you

591
00:44:12,275 --> 00:44:13,967
I need to tell you

592
00:44:15,188 --> 00:44:20,341
Er... it's a little bit to do
with the... brandy glass and, er...

593
00:44:20,436 --> 00:44:23,087
...a little bit to do with
that woman... you met today

594
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:28,019
Only... please let me finish
before you say anything

595
00:44:29,523 --> 00:44:30,702
Okay?

596
00:44:34,867 --> 00:44:35,915
Helen?

597
00:44:39,892 --> 00:44:41,004
Bollocks

598
00:44:41,684 --> 00:44:44,105
Come on, James!

599
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:47,951
Come on, come on!

600
00:44:49,971 --> 00:44:52,306
Come on, come on!

601
00:45:11,571 --> 00:45:12,848
That's really weird

602
00:45:12,946 --> 00:45:15,435
I knew there'd be a boat race going
by with purple and white shirts

603
00:45:16,786 --> 00:45:18,129
Sorry?

604
00:45:18,228 --> 00:45:20,367
Why hasn't he asked you to
go with him to Dorset?

605
00:45:20,468 --> 00:45:22,411
He has... I've got to work

606
00:45:22,515 --> 00:45:25,364
Anyway it'll be good for him
to get away. We need a bit of space

607
00:45:27,634 --> 00:45:29,545
Anna, can I ask you
a daft question?

608
00:45:30,098 --> 00:45:33,263
Did you drop a glass
in the laundry basket at our party?

609
00:45:34,162 --> 00:45:36,717
Sounds like a ridiculous thing
to do. It was almost certainly me

610
00:45:38,674 --> 00:45:39,657
Are you okay?

611
00:45:39,763 --> 00:45:41,192
Just going quietly mad

612
00:45:41,299 --> 00:45:42,476
Thank God for that. I was worried

613
00:45:45,394 --> 00:45:47,534
Faster

614
00:45:53,234 --> 00:45:55,144
And to my left...

615
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:57,161
And to my right...

616
00:45:57,265 --> 00:45:59,339
And with my left...

617
00:45:59,441 --> 00:46:01,003
And with my right...

618
00:46:01,746 --> 00:46:04,430
And with the 'head'...

619
00:46:06,033 --> 00:46:11,536
Father Abraham 'head'
had seven sons, head', '¡head'

620
00:46:11,634 --> 00:46:15,313
Seven sons had
Father Abraham 'head'

621
00:46:17,233 --> 00:46:19,121
Are you sure
it's just writer's block?

622
00:46:20,083 --> 00:46:21,456
I mean, you seem so distant

623
00:46:23,537 --> 00:46:26,606
I'm here, Gerry, if you need
to talk to me about anything

624
00:46:27,282 --> 00:46:28,460
Hey, that's Helen in there

625
00:46:32,593 --> 00:46:33,871
Look, she's got blonde hair

626
00:46:35,186 --> 00:46:38,602
There's loads of them... having some
kind of sponsored epileptic fit

627
00:46:43,058 --> 00:46:44,138
Lydia

628
00:46:45,137 --> 00:46:47,628
Maybe it isn't writer's block
at all, Gerry

629
00:46:48,688 --> 00:46:50,631
Maybe it's Helen block

630
00:46:51,537 --> 00:46:57,323
I don't want to hear about Helen.
I don't care about Helen

631
00:47:00,529 --> 00:47:04,722
The trouble is...
you do quite clearly

632
00:47:07,345 --> 00:47:09,418
I just thought of
a great finish for your book!

633
00:47:11,087 --> 00:47:12,944
The End!

634
00:47:26,515 --> 00:47:28,270
Yes, you are, Clive

635
00:47:28,369 --> 00:47:30,924
He's opening his first restaurant
in six days...

636
00:47:31,026 --> 00:47:33,230
...and he's completely disorganised

637
00:47:33,329 --> 00:47:37,642
Well, you know at my old company we had 'wars '
getting Pierre Claude's restaurant open

638
00:47:37,745 --> 00:47:39,818
You did Pierre Claude?

639
00:47:40,656 --> 00:47:44,072
Mmm
Er, he's my hero. You did his launch?

640
00:47:44,784 --> 00:47:47,403
Well I heard that was a really
classy do. People went on about it

641
00:47:48,656 --> 00:47:50,218
I mean, six days is...

642
00:47:51,728 --> 00:47:53,617
...could I come down
and take a look?

643
00:47:53,713 --> 00:47:55,916
I can't promise anything stupendous

644
00:47:56,015 --> 00:47:59,280
Sure, yeah. Yeah, no problem...
You're kidding?

645
00:47:59,792 --> 00:48:00,971
Yeah, come down

646
00:48:01,073 --> 00:48:03,463
Pierre Claude? Oh, wow!

647
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:11,056
You're very thoughtful, James.
You give out an incredible amount

648
00:48:11,792 --> 00:48:15,209
Oh, you're the same.
You encouraged me today

649
00:48:15,312 --> 00:48:17,352
I saw you jumping up
and down like a mad thing

650
00:48:18,544 --> 00:48:19,822
Spurred me on

651
00:48:22,927 --> 00:48:26,158
I love this bridge. My great
grandfather helped to build it

652
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:31,626
I often come and... stand on it
when I want to, um...

653
00:48:33,168 --> 00:48:34,795
Build a bridge?

654
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:36,943
I'm sorry

655
00:48:45,232 --> 00:48:46,378
Oh God, James, don't

656
00:48:47,984 --> 00:48:49,806
Oh... I'm sorry. I, I...

657
00:48:50,511 --> 00:48:55,084
...I know this is an ideal sort
of kissing moment...

658
00:48:55,183 --> 00:48:58,153
...you know, night, moon, boat,
water lapping...

659
00:48:58,705 --> 00:49:01,640
...you know, it's, um... i
t's perfect and I'm...

660
00:49:01,743 --> 00:49:04,942
...I'm not feeling that
it would be nice...

661
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,562
...but I don't really know anything
about you and I'm...

662
00:49:08,881 --> 00:49:10,919
...I'm still on the rebound

663
00:49:11,023 --> 00:49:13,642
Oh God, I hate that word but I am

664
00:49:13,744 --> 00:49:15,818
Ah, who isn't? Everyone is

665
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:18,920
I'm on the rebound myself...
in a way...

666
00:49:21,263 --> 00:49:23,336
So, who are you
on the rebound from?

667
00:49:24,624 --> 00:49:26,534
A girl called Pamela

668
00:49:26,639 --> 00:49:29,422
My whole life pivots around.
Pam and I breaking up

669
00:49:29,519 --> 00:49:30,600
When was that?

670
00:49:30,704 --> 00:49:32,646
1973, we were eight

671
00:49:33,999 --> 00:49:36,172
I bloody loved that woman

672
00:49:36,272 --> 00:49:39,982
No warning, just up gone...
left me for somebody else

673
00:49:40,624 --> 00:49:41,704
Who?

674
00:49:41,807 --> 00:49:43,912
Gary Glitter!
The cow

675
00:49:44,014 --> 00:49:47,464
Gary Glitter, for crying out loud!

676
00:49:48,175 --> 00:49:52,400
I mean all my friends were being left for
Donny Osmond or David Cassidy or...

677
00:49:52,496 --> 00:49:54,635
I could have come to
terms with that, given time

678
00:49:55,245 --> 00:49:58,281
But Gary. Oh she wanted
to 'touch him there, yeah'

679
00:49:59,184 --> 00:50:00,361
You know?

680
00:50:00,463 --> 00:50:02,569
Well, I went to pieces
as you can imagine

681
00:50:02,671 --> 00:50:05,007
And there was no 'junior Prozac'
to see me through so...

682
00:50:16,558 --> 00:50:18,413
So I, er, I, um...

683
00:50:18,510 --> 00:50:19,438
I kissed you

684
00:50:19,535 --> 00:50:21,541
Yeah, yeah, I spotted that too

685
00:50:21,647 --> 00:50:23,470
You weren't gonna do that

686
00:50:25,231 --> 00:50:28,810
Um, hmm... would you mind, um...
just putting that down to

687
00:50:28,910 --> 00:50:31,214
a momentary lapse of,
um, concentration?

688
00:50:31,822 --> 00:50:32,869
Is that what it was?

689
00:50:32,974 --> 00:50:34,283
No

690
00:50:34,382 --> 00:50:36,873
Y-yes, I don't... Oh, help

691
00:50:42,893 --> 00:50:46,790
I, I don't want to be a confusion
in your life, Helen. I don't truly

692
00:50:47,086 --> 00:50:50,535
But something's happened to me
since I've met you and...

693
00:50:51,406 --> 00:50:55,368
...that I wasn't expecting and...
and I don't really...

694
00:50:56,686 --> 00:50:59,021
...well, well wasn't expecting

695
00:50:59,535 --> 00:51:01,990
Repetition of expecting.
Must buy a thesaurus

696
00:51:02,094 --> 00:51:02,989
Anyway, I...

697
00:52:09,453 --> 00:52:11,876
You did remember to take a full page
ad in 'Adulterer's Weekly'? Jesus!

698
00:52:17,389 --> 00:52:19,015
Lydia, get in the car, will you?

699
00:52:19,117 --> 00:52:21,289
How many years have you been going
to paint that stain off?

700
00:53:43,596 --> 00:53:44,840
He didn't even pay the bill?
Of course not. What do you think?

701
00:53:44,939 --> 00:53:47,308
Um I'm, I'm just... Would you excuse me,
please? I've just remembered I, I'm...

702
00:53:51,596 --> 00:53:53,702
What do you mean you
want to see me?

703
00:53:53,804 --> 00:53:57,188
Jesus Christ, Gerry, what...
How did you get in?

704
00:53:57,292 --> 00:54:00,588
One of the waiters is,
is a, a friend of Russell's

705
00:54:00,682 --> 00:54:02,789
He got me a ticket.
It's a great do, Helen

706
00:54:02,892 --> 00:54:04,965
I, I hear your company's
really taken off...

707
00:54:05,068 --> 00:54:08,134
Gerry, you can't
just turn up like this

708
00:54:08,235 --> 00:54:09,797
This is a really important nights
for me

709
00:54:09,899 --> 00:54:11,426
Yes, I can, Helen

710
00:54:11,531 --> 00:54:15,462
I can 'just turn up'. It, it's the most
important 'just turn up' I've ever done

711
00:54:16,043 --> 00:54:17,669
Oh God. We, we can't talk in here

712
00:54:24,779 --> 00:54:27,912
We've been through too much just
to drop this. Haven't we? Surely

713
00:54:31,979 --> 00:54:33,026
Helen...

714
00:54:33,516 --> 00:54:35,044
...please, look at me

715
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:38,915
I'm sorry

716
00:54:41,195 --> 00:54:42,691
Really sorry

717
00:54:44,010 --> 00:54:46,084
You're too good not to fight for.
The last...

718
00:54:46,187 --> 00:54:48,741
Oh God, Gerry,
don't talk about fight. I...

719
00:54:55,210 --> 00:54:57,066
Good looking bloke

720
00:54:57,804 --> 00:54:59,178
Are you seeing him?
Er...

721
00:54:59,275 --> 00:55:02,091
I, I'm sorry,
it's not my place to ask

722
00:55:04,588 --> 00:55:05,961
Is that him?

723
00:55:06,058 --> 00:55:07,401
Guess so

724
00:55:08,330 --> 00:55:09,641
Does she know about Claudia?

725
00:55:09,739 --> 00:55:10,688
No

726
00:55:11,498 --> 00:55:12,961
I really like her, Clive

727
00:55:13,836 --> 00:55:15,909
I'm confused.
I feel a bit lost suddenly

728
00:55:17,354 --> 00:55:19,844
Gerry, I really have to
go back inside

729
00:55:19,947 --> 00:55:21,377
Will you come and see me, Helen?

730
00:55:23,273 --> 00:55:26,986
Please, Helen, there's so much
more I want to say. I miss you

731
00:55:29,194 --> 00:55:30,854
Will you come and see me?

732
00:55:33,226 --> 00:55:34,404
Please, Helen

733
00:55:35,403 --> 00:55:36,133
I'll go.

734
00:55:38,571 --> 00:55:39,913
Thanks for listening. I...

735
00:55:41,034 --> 00:55:42,146
...I'm really proud of you

736
00:56:05,259 --> 00:56:06,982
Are you okay?

737
00:56:07,082 --> 00:56:09,702
Yes. Just a bit dizzy

738
00:56:09,802 --> 00:56:11,231
Too much champagne

739
00:56:22,793 --> 00:56:23,874
Oh, sorry

740
00:56:30,379 --> 00:56:32,005
Bye now

741
00:56:32,651 --> 00:56:34,790
Hey... It's official... I love you

742
00:56:36,299 --> 00:56:38,721
Thank you. You're...
you're a genius. I'm ecstatic

743
00:56:39,656 --> 00:56:41,218
Have you, er, have you seen James?

744
00:56:41,929 --> 00:56:45,378
Yeah. Yeah, he had to go...
early start. He apologised

745
00:57:04,521 --> 00:57:07,905
Business trip... Newcastle
or something. I didn't want to pry

746
00:57:08,618 --> 00:57:10,529
His secretary
wasn't very forthcoming

747
00:57:11,272 --> 00:57:12,352
D'you believe he's away?

748
00:57:12,456 --> 00:57:13,570
Don't know

749
00:57:13,673 --> 00:57:14,983
Or do you think
he's just avoiding you?

750
00:57:15,082 --> 00:57:15,714
I don't know

751
00:57:15,816 --> 00:57:16,710
Did you leave a message?

752
00:57:16,809 --> 00:57:17,409
No

753
00:57:17,513 --> 00:57:20,744
D'you think maybe you should have?
Did he actually see Gerry kiss you?

754
00:57:20,841 --> 00:57:21,954
I don't know

755
00:57:22,057 --> 00:57:24,294
D'you think he might be hoping you've called
and not known that you have?

756
00:57:24,393 --> 00:57:25,921
I mean... did you not check
if he has a mobile?

757
00:57:26,025 --> 00:57:28,414
Anna! Ease up, will you?
Bloody hell!

758
00:57:29,192 --> 00:57:31,878
They have less questions
than this on 'Jeopardy'

759
00:57:31,978 --> 00:57:35,328
I was nervous. I wanted to
get off the phone. I felt awkward

760
00:57:36,137 --> 00:57:38,788
Well, it's such a piddly little thing.
It's hardly worth him getting up tight about

761
00:57:38,888 --> 00:57:41,159
Oh, Gerry called by the way

762
00:57:41,673 --> 00:57:44,740
Terrific. That's just...

763
00:57:45,417 --> 00:57:47,873
Two months ago I want Gerry
to come round, James comes round

764
00:57:47,977 --> 00:57:50,115
Now I want James to call,
Gerry calls

765
00:58:00,455 --> 00:58:02,878
It was the weirdest dream.
You were there

766
00:58:03,528 --> 00:58:07,010
And you had a funny mask
over your face...

767
00:58:07,112 --> 00:58:10,791
...and you had something that you needed
to tell me but you couldn't say it

768
00:58:11,337 --> 00:58:14,600
Well that does it, I'm afraid. I'm, er,
taking away your class one drugs for a week

769
00:58:16,232 --> 00:58:20,674
Anyway... um... there's something
else I wanted to tell you

770
00:58:23,367 --> 00:58:25,190
I fainted at work the other night

771
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:28,386
Oh, sweetheart. Are you okay?

772
00:58:28,488 --> 00:58:32,614
Yes, but I don't normally faint
so I, um...

773
00:58:34,791 --> 00:58:36,483
What was that?

774
00:58:37,064 --> 00:58:39,934
I don't know. The people next door are plainly
engaged in some bizarre sexual ritual

775
00:58:40,039 --> 00:58:43,075
I may pop in later
and introduce myself

776
00:58:44,071 --> 00:58:45,599
What were you saying?

777
00:58:45,703 --> 00:58:47,133
Anyway...

778
00:58:47,241 --> 00:58:50,372
...I don't normally faint
so I was a little curious...

779
00:58:56,008 --> 00:58:57,218
Oh shit...

780
00:58:57,672 --> 00:59:00,933
...I stubbed my foot
on the side of the shagging bath

781
00:59:01,607 --> 00:59:03,299
God, sounds horrific

782
00:59:03,399 --> 00:59:04,545
I know

783
00:59:05,639 --> 00:59:06,817
Ssshhh!
Anyway...

784
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:12,003
Listen, there,
there's the landlady.

785
00:59:12,104 --> 00:59:13,086
She keeps coming up with these,
er... corned beef sandwiches

786
00:59:13,191 --> 00:59:16,324
Look I, I'll phone you back when, er,
world war twelve has stopped for tea. Okay

787
00:59:16,424 --> 00:59:17,766
Okay, bye

788
00:59:20,327 --> 00:59:22,978
So I did a test and it turns out
that I'm pregnant

789
00:59:25,319 --> 00:59:27,076
I just though you might
like to know

790
00:59:29,992 --> 00:59:32,775
Have you gone completely insane?

791
00:59:32,871 --> 00:59:33,984
What are you trying to do?

792
00:59:34,087 --> 00:59:36,871
What do you mean 'what am I trying
to do'? I think I've broke my toe

793
00:59:36,968 --> 00:59:41,442
Lydia, I'm on the pissing phone
to Helen, for goodness sake

794
00:59:42,471 --> 00:59:45,025
In case you've forgotten,
she doesn't know you're here

795
00:59:45,511 --> 00:59:48,578
She thinks I'm on a research
trip... along. Remember?

796
00:59:49,192 --> 00:59:50,435
I remeber

797
00:59:51,398 --> 00:59:53,669
Don't worry, I remeber.
It's pretty hard to forget

798
00:59:53,767 --> 00:59:55,622
So what are you trying to do? Huh?!

799
00:59:56,134 --> 01:00:00,130
Coming in here... screeching the
place down when I'm on the phone

800
01:00:01,285 --> 01:00:02,847
Don't you know, Gerry?

801
01:00:03,944 --> 01:00:06,628
Don't you know
what I am trying to do?!

802
01:00:07,943 --> 01:00:10,945
I am trying to
be your girlfriend, Gerry

803
01:00:11,622 --> 01:00:13,696
I am trying to win you back!

804
01:00:13,799 --> 01:00:18,556
It's fairly simple. I am standing
on the platform at Limbo Central...

805
01:00:18,662 --> 01:00:21,763
...with my heart and soul packed
in my suitcase...

806
01:00:21,863 --> 01:00:26,174
...waiting for the Gerry fucking
Express to roll in...

807
01:00:26,279 --> 01:00:29,827
...and tell me that my ticket
is still valid, that I may reboard the train

808
01:00:30,887 --> 01:00:36,607
Only the station announcer keeps coming on
and telling me that my train has been delayed

809
01:00:36,710 --> 01:00:41,829
...as the driver has suffered a major
panic attack in Indecision City!

810
01:00:41,926 --> 01:00:44,775
"We suggest you take the bus!"

811
01:00:45,318 --> 01:00:48,167
That's what I am trying to do,
you cripple!

812
01:00:56,069 --> 01:01:01,571
Except it's quite clear...

813
01:01:02,854 --> 01:01:05,440
...that that is
never going to happen

814
01:01:06,981 --> 01:01:08,356
Is it?

815
01:01:09,957 --> 01:01:11,616
No reply

816
01:01:13,445 --> 01:01:14,395
Perfect

817
01:01:15,751 --> 01:01:19,100
So I... I'm not waiting
any more, Gerry

818
01:01:20,421 --> 01:01:24,700
I am cashing my ticket in.
I am taking that bus

819
01:01:25,542 --> 01:01:26,786
Oh God...

820
01:01:27,270 --> 01:01:30,620
I tell all my friends
"never go back"

821
01:01:31,814 --> 01:01:33,636
Look at me, I must be crazy

822
01:01:34,821 --> 01:01:36,545
Don't phone me for a while

823
01:01:40,454 --> 01:01:43,936
Ow! Oh!
No... don't phone me at all!

824
01:01:44,037 --> 01:01:45,020
Ever!

825
01:01:46,374 --> 01:01:47,869
It's over!

826
01:01:49,222 --> 01:01:50,913
Again!

827
01:01:52,934 --> 01:01:55,782
I've done it, Russell.
I've bloody done it!

828
01:01:56,293 --> 01:01:58,203
EXcellent. Congratulations.
Done what?

829
01:01:58,309 --> 01:01:59,520
I've finished it

830
01:01:59,621 --> 01:02:01,924
Oh, the book... Oh well, great,
mate, that's great

831
01:02:02,469 --> 01:02:04,358
Not the book, not the book, Russell

832
01:02:04,454 --> 01:02:06,364
I'm a novelist, I'm never gonna
finish the book...

833
01:02:06,469 --> 01:02:08,226
The affair!

834
01:02:08,325 --> 01:02:10,181
The affair!
The sordid affair with Lydia

835
01:02:10,277 --> 01:02:12,165
I've blown her out... in Dorset

836
01:02:12,261 --> 01:02:14,498
I was decisive but fair

837
01:02:14,597 --> 01:02:16,059
I've just got back

838
01:02:16,165 --> 01:02:18,752
Oh God, I feel like
I've got out of jail

839
01:02:18,853 --> 01:02:22,650
No more deceit, no more I ying
to Helen. It was such a mistake

840
01:02:22,755 --> 01:02:25,660
"Never go back", Russell.
But it's over

841
01:02:25,956 --> 01:02:29,121
God, I can't tell you
it's such a good feeling

842
01:02:30,308 --> 01:02:33,605
Well, I'm, I'm very pleased.
How does she feel about it, Lydia?

843
01:02:34,309 --> 01:02:37,693
Well, you know, she's not jumping
through hoops obviously, I mean...

844
01:02:37,798 --> 01:02:41,027
...but, but it's the best thing by
far. By far and away the best thing

845
01:02:41,125 --> 01:02:43,330
I mean she, she knows that.
I mean, she will do when she...

846
01:02:44,388 --> 01:02:48,252
well, she was upsel I mean bit
farught, you know... obviously

847
01:02:48,356 --> 01:02:50,178
Oh God, oh God, oh God, I feel good

848
01:02:50,275 --> 01:02:53,376
I've got to go home. I wanna be home
before Helen comes back from work

849
01:02:57,732 --> 01:02:58,529
Er, no

850
01:02:59,621 --> 01:03:01,476
Because you never buy me flowers
when you're meant to...

851
01:03:01,571 --> 01:03:03,360
...let alone
when you're not meant to

852
01:03:03,461 --> 01:03:04,770
So, yes, I'm a little suspicious

853
01:03:04,868 --> 01:03:06,941
I want to know what else you've
been doing that you're not meant to

854
01:03:07,044 --> 01:03:08,387
Wait, hang on

855
01:03:08,484 --> 01:03:11,800
Let me get this straight
'cause this is just about brilliant

856
01:03:11,907 --> 01:03:13,949
I buy you flowers on a whim in a...

857
01:03:14,052 --> 01:03:18,659
in a, in a fit of, of,
of, um, of romance but...

858
01:03:19,204 --> 01:03:20,798
See... you couldn't
even think of the word

859
01:03:20,901 --> 01:03:23,803
But instead of being, of being grateful,
instead of being 'romanced'...

860
01:03:23,908 --> 01:03:28,960
...you're instantly convinced
that I'm ensconced in some decrepit tacky,

861
01:03:29,058 --> 01:03:31,582
underhand clandestine affair!

862
01:03:32,228 --> 01:03:33,504
In a nutshell

863
01:03:44,388 --> 01:03:45,533
Gerry?

864
01:03:48,708 --> 01:03:50,016
Are you back?

865
01:03:51,620 --> 01:03:53,530
I missed you so I came home early
to see you

866
01:03:54,115 --> 01:03:55,043
God

867
01:03:57,987 --> 01:03:59,232
What are they?

868
01:04:00,164 --> 01:04:01,593
Well they're flowers

869
01:04:02,371 --> 01:04:03,550
For you. Um...

870
01:04:04,867 --> 01:04:06,111
...d'you not like them?

871
01:04:07,619 --> 01:04:11,199
That image of her sitting
on top of you, oh God, I...

872
01:04:11,746 --> 01:04:13,689
...I, I really don't know
why I agreed to come

873
01:04:13,794 --> 01:04:16,383
Please stop, Gerry, don't, I,
I don't want you to touch me

874
01:04:16,963 --> 01:04:18,655
I'm, I'm sorry. Um, um, don't go

875
01:04:19,332 --> 01:04:22,878
Please try and...
put her out of your mind

876
01:04:24,003 --> 01:04:25,892
She's, she's out of mine

877
01:04:25,987 --> 01:04:27,962
It's finished... over

878
01:04:28,067 --> 01:04:30,009
I made a mistake. Such a big...
big mistake and I'm sorry

879
01:04:30,115 --> 01:04:32,124
I'm truly, truly sorry

880
01:04:34,915 --> 01:04:37,600
I mean this new bloke, this James
Hammerton that you're seeing...

881
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:39,904
...does he not make mistakes?

882
01:04:40,003 --> 01:04:41,727
How do y ouknow his name?

883
01:04:41,827 --> 01:04:44,446
A mate of Russell's works
at the restaurant

884
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:48,411
They're... mutual friends. I... I mean,
it's not especially important

885
01:04:48,516 --> 01:04:51,713
Well I don't want to talk about James Hammerton
or anyone else. I have to go

886
01:04:52,803 --> 01:04:54,330
Oh, by the, by the way I've, er...

887
01:04:56,099 --> 01:04:57,529
...I've stopped writing the book

888
01:05:00,067 --> 01:05:04,826
Helen... the truth is
I can't write without you

889
01:05:05,444 --> 01:05:07,133
I can't do anything without you

890
01:05:09,666 --> 01:05:11,423
I want you to
come back to me, Helen

891
01:05:14,402 --> 01:05:16,060
We were so good together

892
01:05:17,473 --> 01:05:19,417
Remeber, remember
how good we are together?

893
01:05:23,233 --> 01:05:24,860
Sorry... Just wait

894
01:05:28,578 --> 01:05:28,993
Yeah?

895
01:05:29,091 --> 01:05:31,874
I'm late, Gerry... Four days.
I'm never late

896
01:05:32,482 --> 01:05:35,264
Oh, Russell. Er, look, hi

897
01:05:35,361 --> 01:05:37,119
Er, look, mate. Look, er, can I ring you
back in a few minutes, yeah?

898
01:05:37,219 --> 01:05:39,838
Yeah... Yeah, okay. Okay.
Thanks, mate, cheers. Bye

899
01:05:40,802 --> 01:05:41,948
It's, er... Russell

900
01:05:43,553 --> 01:05:45,758
I'm, I'm dying for the loo

901
01:06:03,395 --> 01:06:07,258
Telephone number 01714443184

902
01:06:07,361 --> 01:06:09,337
To return the call press three

903
01:06:14,178 --> 01:06:16,448
Why are you pretending I'm Russell?
You know I hate that

904
01:06:16,994 --> 01:06:18,783
What's going on?

905
01:06:19,745 --> 01:06:21,983
Gerry, answer me. Who's there?

906
01:06:22,081 --> 01:06:24,449
It's Helen actually. We met once

907
01:06:24,545 --> 01:06:26,750
I interrupted you
faking your orgasm

908
01:06:26,850 --> 01:06:28,759
Sorry I can't be more specific

909
01:06:32,321 --> 01:06:33,848
You know what I was thinking?

910
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:36,502
You're not going, are you?

911
01:06:36,929 --> 01:06:41,503
You wanker. You sad, sad wonker

912
01:06:43,586 --> 01:06:46,042
God, I feel like such a mug!

913
01:06:46,146 --> 01:06:48,448
The useless, no good...

914
01:06:48,545 --> 01:06:51,415
...shagging, horrible,
despicable, I ying...

915
01:06:51,521 --> 01:06:54,009
...two-faced pissing, shagging...

916
01:06:54,113 --> 01:06:54,780
You said shagging

917
01:06:59,362 --> 01:07:00,671
You know the worst bit?

918
01:07:01,761 --> 01:07:03,584
All I could think about was James

919
01:07:03,681 --> 01:07:06,812
I felt like I was being unfaithful
to James just by being there

920
01:07:07,906 --> 01:07:09,881
That sounds like the best bit.
And you were

921
01:07:09,985 --> 01:07:11,709
He didn't call, did he?

922
01:07:13,953 --> 01:07:15,479
That's nearly a week

923
01:07:17,313 --> 01:07:18,808
I think I've blown it.
I've blown it, haven't I?

924
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:22,016
I blame British Telecom.
All this new technology

925
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:27,613
This number if you want
to know who called...

926
01:07:27,713 --> 01:07:31,457
...another one if you don't
want them to know you called...

927
01:07:31,552 --> 01:07:34,902
...itemised bills, take away
the first number you thought of

928
01:07:35,008 --> 01:07:38,491
I mean they are single-handedly condemning
the average red-blooded Englishman...

929
01:07:38,592 --> 01:07:40,283
...to a life of terminal monogamy

930
01:07:40,384 --> 01:07:42,458
What are they after?
The Nobel Peace Prize?

931
01:07:43,232 --> 01:07:44,574
And Lydia might be pregnant

932
01:07:50,913 --> 01:07:53,816
Oh no more, please...
I can't take it

933
01:07:55,424 --> 01:07:57,312
Oh this is terrific stuff

934
01:07:57,729 --> 01:08:00,315
I must say, being with you makes
the wait for the next episode of

935
01:08:00,416 --> 01:08:02,489
'Seinfeld' much easier to bear

936
01:08:02,592 --> 01:08:05,113
I didn't reckon on things
turning out this way

937
01:08:05,217 --> 01:08:08,796
Everything's a cock up.
What's going on?

938
01:08:09,408 --> 01:08:12,224
Well... to use boxing parlance,
if I may... it's quite simple

939
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:15,033
You've just lost

940
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:18,462
Are you sure? You've been a bit...

941
01:08:19,167 --> 01:08:21,722
...I don't know, a bit distant
since I've got back

942
01:08:21,824 --> 01:08:23,232
I know

943
01:08:24,031 --> 01:08:25,276
Well, okay...
there are a couple of things.

944
01:08:25,376 --> 01:08:27,320
Which one do you want
to hear first?

945
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,309
I don't mind

946
01:08:29,504 --> 01:08:33,119
Well the 'small'thing is that
I've got an interview for a job

947
01:08:33,217 --> 01:08:34,776
A PR job, a proper one

948
01:08:36,607 --> 01:08:38,681
International company
opening up in London

949
01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:43,517
Chairwoman herself called, said she
had heard a lot about me and...

950
01:08:43,615 --> 01:08:46,584
she's invited me to her apartment
tomorrow evening for a serious chat

951
01:08:48,352 --> 01:08:49,596
Jesus Christ!

952
01:08:51,519 --> 01:08:52,283
What?

953
01:08:52,383 --> 01:08:58,135
Jesus Christ, I mean that's... that's
not a small thing, that's... that's huge

954
01:08:58,239 --> 01:09:01,405
I mean it's... I mean it's... it's brilliant.
I mean that's the best

955
01:09:01,502 --> 01:09:03,064
Is the blind buggered again?

956
01:09:03,169 --> 01:09:04,795
No. Er... no

957
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:06,303
Well, I...

958
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:15,063
Are you all right?

959
01:09:15,167 --> 01:09:19,391
Yeah, no, I'm fine, darling.
My sweetheart, that's great, it's tremendous

960
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:20,863
I'm thrilled. I'm so thrill...

961
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:22,522
Hello?

962
01:09:22,623 --> 01:09:24,183
I really need to talk to you

963
01:09:25,471 --> 01:09:26,520
Hi, Russ. How are you?

964
01:09:26,624 --> 01:09:30,399
Come by my apartment tomorrow night
at eight. It's important

965
01:09:31,199 --> 01:09:34,516
Ah, really, mate. No, what a drag

966
01:09:34,623 --> 01:09:35,868
Oh no, yeah. Okay, yeah, sure.
Sure, sure, yeah

967
01:09:35,966 --> 01:09:38,041
Yeah, yeah, I'll help you

968
01:09:38,143 --> 01:09:39,550
Yeah, yeah, cheers, mate.
Cheers. Bye

969
01:09:40,575 --> 01:09:42,747
It's Russell's family
is descending unannounced

970
01:09:43,038 --> 01:09:44,948
Yeah, he wants me to, er,
go round tomorrow evening and,

971
01:09:45,055 --> 01:09:48,124
er... help him clear out,
er, his spare room

972
01:09:50,046 --> 01:09:51,640
Er, right. Okay. So...

973
01:09:57,055 --> 01:09:59,228
Sorry, what was the other thing
you wanted to tell me?

974
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:02,716
Doesn't matter. It's not important

975
01:10:29,150 --> 01:10:30,612
Hammerton Enterprises

976
01:10:36,510 --> 01:10:37,820
Rachael, I'm going out to the shops

977
01:10:38,270 --> 01:10:39,896
Can I get you anything?
No thanks

978
01:10:41,503 --> 01:10:42,779
Are you okay?

979
01:10:42,878 --> 01:10:44,603
Yes

980
01:10:45,597 --> 01:10:47,703
Yes. Yes, I'm fine

981
01:10:48,287 --> 01:10:51,156
I just... you know, I go to
the shops, just I'll be, um...

982
01:11:25,725 --> 01:11:26,904
Sorry

983
01:11:29,725 --> 01:11:31,286
Hello!
Hi. Hi Hi

984
01:11:33,246 --> 01:11:34,554
How... how are you?

985
01:11:34,652 --> 01:11:36,693
I'm... I'm great

986
01:11:36,797 --> 01:11:38,205
Er, how are you?

987
01:11:38,302 --> 01:11:40,571
Sorry, you're great

988
01:11:44,702 --> 01:11:45,562
Business lunch?

989
01:11:45,660 --> 01:11:47,570
Yeah, just a chat, you know

990
01:11:48,317 --> 01:11:49,724
Well my office
is just round the corner

991
01:11:49,820 --> 01:11:54,044
I know. Um... I, I, I thought
you were away on business

992
01:11:54,140 --> 01:11:57,404
Yeah, I was. I just, I, um,
got back last night as a matter of, er

993
01:12:00,445 --> 01:12:03,130
Helen, look, please
don't think that I, that I...

994
01:12:03,837 --> 01:12:06,227
Ah... it's okay, I...
I haven't thought

995
01:12:06,333 --> 01:12:08,569
I mean I, I,
I didn't think that or not

996
01:12:09,116 --> 01:12:12,217
No, I mean... don't think
that I have not called you

997
01:12:12,316 --> 01:12:14,226
I haven't 'not' called you

998
01:12:14,332 --> 01:12:16,156
I mean, I don't... I don't mean
I haven't 'not' called you

999
01:12:16,254 --> 01:12:18,327
because that's a double negative...

1000
01:12:18,428 --> 01:12:19,891
...so as to say
that I 'have' called you

1001
01:12:19,997 --> 01:12:21,143
When did you call?

1002
01:12:21,245 --> 01:12:22,967
Er, well I, I didn't

1003
01:12:23,707 --> 01:12:28,565
But I... I didn't 'not' call you in the way
that you might think I didn't call you

1004
01:12:28,668 --> 01:12:30,579
Oh dear

1005
01:12:32,508 --> 01:12:34,898
I wanted to call you

1006
01:12:35,004 --> 01:12:37,493
I even did that dial all but the
last number thing and then not, er...

1007
01:12:38,972 --> 01:12:40,729
It's... ridiculous behaviour

1008
01:12:40,829 --> 01:12:42,324
Totally

1009
01:12:43,549 --> 01:12:46,648
You see, I... I thought you still had to
deal with, with your other, er...

1010
01:12:47,837 --> 01:12:49,114
Gerry?!

1011
01:12:49,213 --> 01:12:51,123
Well I don't know,
is that... yeah, if...

1012
01:12:51,228 --> 01:12:53,269
And I thought it was best
if I allowed youto...

1013
01:12:53,371 --> 01:12:55,707
Gerry is why you haven't called me?

1014
01:12:55,836 --> 01:12:59,700
Well, after Clive's party I didn't
want to just presume that you'd, that we had

1015
01:12:59,804 --> 01:13:02,904
You think I just go to bed with all successful
oarsmen that I come across?

1016
01:13:05,469 --> 01:13:07,062
Sorry, nervous humour

1017
01:13:07,964 --> 01:13:09,307
Well I hoped not

1018
01:13:12,987 --> 01:13:14,330
Sorry, excuse me

1019
01:13:15,837 --> 01:13:16,785
Hello?

1020
01:13:19,035 --> 01:13:20,346
Oh, I see. I'll, um...

1021
01:13:22,588 --> 01:13:25,109
...I'll come straight away.
Okay, thanks

1022
01:13:26,363 --> 01:13:28,786
My... mum had to go into hospital

1023
01:13:28,891 --> 01:13:31,347
She's had some tests done. The results
are through. I should, er, go

1024
01:13:33,052 --> 01:13:34,644
Do you want me to come with you?

1025
01:13:37,724 --> 01:13:39,699
Yeah, that's really nice of you

1026
01:13:42,395 --> 01:13:43,324
Er... well maybe, um...

1027
01:13:44,316 --> 01:13:46,803
I don't... she's quite frail
and I, and I don't know how she's gonna...

1028
01:13:46,907 --> 01:13:48,152
It's okay

1029
01:13:49,147 --> 01:13:50,522
but, um... thanks

1030
01:13:53,883 --> 01:13:56,186
I'm, er, well some friends are
having dinner at Clive's tonight...

1031
01:13:56,283 --> 01:13:59,513
...if you're, if you're not doing
anything, you want to come along

1032
01:14:02,076 --> 01:14:03,386
Well some other time

1033
01:14:03,484 --> 01:14:05,307
I'd love to if that's okay

1034
01:14:06,428 --> 01:14:11,765
Yeah, yeah. Of course, crikey,
it's, it's, it's very, very okay, yeah

1035
01:14:13,659 --> 01:14:16,921
But well, at the risk of sounding
old-fashioned, I'll pick you up at eight

1036
01:14:17,019 --> 01:14:19,704
Is that a 'will' pick me up,
or a 'haven't, not, didn't, might'?

1037
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:25,017
Listen... don't worry
about your mum. She'll be okay

1038
01:14:25,915 --> 01:14:27,826
Remember Monty Python

1039
01:14:29,946 --> 01:14:31,354
Well I'll see you later

1040
01:14:34,362 --> 01:14:35,607
Bye

1041
01:14:46,971 --> 01:14:48,859
How are you?
Yeah, just... you know...

1042
01:14:52,922 --> 01:14:54,679
Is Gerry excited
about being a daddy?

1043
01:14:54,778 --> 01:14:56,535
I haven't told him yet

1044
01:14:56,635 --> 01:14:59,735
Never seems to
be the right moment somehow

1045
01:15:00,859 --> 01:15:02,997
Come on... let's celebrate
with a proper drink

1046
01:15:03,803 --> 01:15:05,331
Bloody marvellous idea

1047
01:15:07,099 --> 01:15:10,329
I really shouldn't in my condition
but I'm really going to

1048
01:15:10,426 --> 01:15:11,802
What have you got?

1049
01:15:12,730 --> 01:15:14,486
Um... brandy

1050
01:15:14,585 --> 01:15:16,474
Oh, no, yuk. Makes me vomit

1051
01:16:32,218 --> 01:16:33,593
Half day?

1052
01:16:39,130 --> 01:16:40,723
James?!

1053
01:16:43,322 --> 01:16:44,729
Since last night?

1054
01:16:47,386 --> 01:16:48,727
Sorry

1055
01:16:50,202 --> 01:16:51,411
You can't tell from one

1056
01:16:52,346 --> 01:16:53,655
They can be inaccurate

1057
01:16:54,522 --> 01:16:55,896
I bought three packets

1058
01:16:56,473 --> 01:16:58,231
Two in a packet, that's six

1059
01:16:58,937 --> 01:17:00,564
You can tell from six

1060
01:17:02,232 --> 01:17:03,443
What are you gonna do?

1061
01:17:10,296 --> 01:17:11,891
Is James Hammerton in?

1062
01:17:11,993 --> 01:17:13,488
I'm afraid not

1063
01:17:13,592 --> 01:17:15,187
Um, do you know when he's due back?

1064
01:17:15,290 --> 01:17:18,487
I'm not sure. He's gone to visit his mother
in hospital with his wife

1065
01:17:18,775 --> 01:17:20,752
Would you like to leave a message?

1066
01:17:22,553 --> 01:17:23,928
What?

1067
01:17:24,026 --> 01:17:26,001
Can I take a name and number?
Get him to call you

1068
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:31,604
Um... no, thank you

1069
01:18:16,695 --> 01:18:18,222
There's something
I want you to know

1070
01:18:20,632 --> 01:18:23,121
Anna doesn't drink Brandy, Gerry,
it makes her vomit

1071
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:28,401
and those glasses were
not used at the party

1072
01:18:28,504 --> 01:18:30,675
They only come out for
special dinners, you know that

1073
01:18:33,208 --> 01:18:35,663
Am I meant to immediately
get the reference here?

1074
01:18:36,470 --> 01:18:38,261
Are you having an affair?

1075
01:18:39,512 --> 01:18:41,422
Just tell me yes or no

1076
01:18:45,113 --> 01:18:47,480
No, I'm not

1077
01:18:56,536 --> 01:18:59,025
Helen, look into my eyes

1078
01:18:59,830 --> 01:19:02,450
I am not having an affair

1079
01:19:04,888 --> 01:19:06,065
I'm not

1080
01:19:10,936 --> 01:19:13,457
Well, I shouldn't have brought this up now,
I've got to go to my interview

1081
01:19:15,799 --> 01:19:17,174
We'll talk later

1082
01:19:19,127 --> 01:19:21,200
Are you going to be here
when I get back?

1083
01:19:21,302 --> 01:19:23,408
Yes. Of course

1084
01:19:26,999 --> 01:19:28,789
Helen... listen

1085
01:19:30,295 --> 01:19:31,822
Good luck, okay

1086
01:19:41,622 --> 01:19:42,353
Hello

1087
01:19:42,455 --> 01:19:44,397
Hi, Anna, is Helen there?

1088
01:19:44,502 --> 01:19:46,193
You've got a damned nerve
phoning here

1089
01:19:46,807 --> 01:19:48,182
What?

1090
01:19:52,247 --> 01:19:55,314
Anna, please, just open the door.
I don't know what's going on

1091
01:19:56,278 --> 01:19:57,456
You dono't know what's going on?

1092
01:19:57,557 --> 01:20:01,303
I'll tell you then. She saw you, James,
at the hospital. With your wife

1093
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:03,122
You know, the one
with the wedding ring

1094
01:20:03,222 --> 01:20:04,172
What is it with you bloody men?
We're not just here...

1095
01:20:04,279 --> 01:20:06,418
Anna, let me see her. I can...
She's not here

1096
01:20:06,519 --> 01:20:07,947
Where is she?

1097
01:20:08,054 --> 01:20:09,364
What's it to you? I don't know

1098
01:20:10,486 --> 01:20:12,211
Oh shit, shit. Bollocks

1099
01:20:12,919 --> 01:20:14,480
Oh God. You idiot!

1100
01:20:34,038 --> 01:20:35,467
Clive, you seen Helen?

1101
01:20:35,573 --> 01:20:37,298
No. Why?

1102
01:21:06,614 --> 01:21:07,727
Helen!

1103
01:21:10,486 --> 01:21:11,632
Helen!

1104
01:21:15,510 --> 01:21:18,325
Helen...
Helen, you've made a mistake

1105
01:21:18,420 --> 01:21:20,527
Oh, I am such an idiot.
Helen, look at me

1106
01:21:20,629 --> 01:21:21,558
Listen to me, please

1107
01:21:21,654 --> 01:21:25,932
No, you listen!
I never want to see you again

1108
01:21:26,741 --> 01:21:29,460
I have been throught enough
for one year

1109
01:21:30,101 --> 01:21:33,550
I stupidly believed that here was
a man who was different from 'men '

1110
01:21:33,654 --> 01:21:36,142
But it is clear
that I made a mistake

1111
01:21:36,757 --> 01:21:40,370
Now please...
do me a favour and go away!

1112
01:21:41,301 --> 01:21:43,985
I am married, Helen,
but I am separated

1113
01:21:44,085 --> 01:21:46,323
Walk away if you want
but take this with you

1114
01:21:46,421 --> 01:21:49,739
The woman you saw today was
the woman I married three years ago

1115
01:21:49,845 --> 01:21:52,813
We separated six months ago
and soon we'll be divorced

1116
01:21:54,517 --> 01:21:56,372
Nothing aggressive

1117
01:21:56,468 --> 01:21:58,062
I didn't tell you before because...

1118
01:21:59,637 --> 01:22:03,500
...I don't know why, I...
I have wanted to tell you so many times and

1119
01:22:04,725 --> 01:22:07,824
...and now you've found out
another way I wish I had told y ou

1120
01:22:09,685 --> 01:22:11,890
My mother is ill in hospital
as you know...

1121
01:22:11,989 --> 01:22:15,439
...and Claudia agreed to keep up the
pretence that we were okay still for my mum

1122
01:22:16,692 --> 01:22:19,792
As a favour.
She's a very decent woman

1123
01:22:22,421 --> 01:22:24,047
Do you have a mum, Helen?

1124
01:22:28,021 --> 01:22:29,264
Ten minutes, Lydia

1125
01:22:29,364 --> 01:22:31,754
And don't ever turn up at
my kitchen window again like that

1126
01:22:32,757 --> 01:22:35,212
It's over. You know?
You said it yourself

1127
01:22:35,316 --> 01:22:37,521
I know. Sorry, I wasn't thinking

1128
01:22:37,620 --> 01:22:39,247
I just want to show you something

1129
01:22:47,413 --> 01:22:48,340
Oh, Helen...

1130
01:22:49,301 --> 01:22:51,723
if we are not gonna be together then let's
make sure it's for the right reason

1131
01:22:51,828 --> 01:22:54,481
And right now
there is no reason, none

1132
01:22:54,581 --> 01:22:57,580
there is just confusion and
it can be erased in a split second

1133
01:23:01,333 --> 01:23:02,642
Get that, would you?

1134
01:23:16,917 --> 01:23:18,672
Of course, if you don't
want to keep it, darling...

1135
01:23:19,539 --> 01:23:20,848
Who is it?

1136
01:23:21,460 --> 01:23:23,882
Oh, hello again.
You're right on time

1137
01:23:26,804 --> 01:23:28,561
Is this the truth, James?

1138
01:23:40,403 --> 01:23:42,378
Permission to engage
the enemy, sir?

1139
01:23:48,372 --> 01:23:50,829
Thing is, I can't take
the interview just now

1140
01:23:50,931 --> 01:23:54,162
I'm discussing whether or not I'm
going to keep your boyfriend's baby

1141
01:23:57,331 --> 01:23:58,411
James...

1142
01:23:59,668 --> 01:24:01,326
...there's something
I have to tell you

1143
01:24:01,940 --> 01:24:04,210
I'm so sorry you had to
hear it this way, Helen

1144
01:24:07,602 --> 01:24:10,254
Er, I really should just phone
Anna and tell her I'm okay

1145
01:24:13,107 --> 01:24:14,384
Helen

1146
01:24:16,307 --> 01:24:17,715
I love you

1147
01:24:18,003 --> 01:24:19,410
Helen, wait, please. Wait!

1148
01:24:19,923 --> 01:24:20,872
Let me go!

1149
01:24:20,978 --> 01:24:22,190
Helen!
Helen!

1150
01:25:17,618 --> 01:25:20,008
James... are you her husband?

1151
01:25:21,874 --> 01:25:24,013
Er... I will be.
We're, we're getting married

1152
01:25:25,010 --> 01:25:26,538
If I could have a quick word?

1153
01:25:28,723 --> 01:25:31,538
Helen has suffered major
internal injuries, James

1154
01:25:32,818 --> 01:25:35,273
Helen has lost her baby,
I'm afraid, Gerry

1155
01:25:36,595 --> 01:25:38,538
I'm afraid she's lost her baby

1156
01:25:40,146 --> 01:25:41,804
You did know she was pregnant?

1157
01:25:43,251 --> 01:25:44,746
Did you know she was pregnant?

1158
01:25:49,042 --> 01:25:50,798
She will be okay though, won't she?

1159
01:25:51,922 --> 01:25:54,126
She is, she is going to wake up,
isn't she, Doctor?

1160
01:26:43,826 --> 01:26:47,242
Helen, for some reason
I know you can hear me

1161
01:26:51,185 --> 01:26:53,968
I'm glad we got things
sorted out... tonight

1162
01:27:09,104 --> 01:27:11,724
I'm glad you caught
the train that day

1163
01:27:27,056 --> 01:27:29,293
I am going to make you so happy

1164
01:27:33,168 --> 01:27:34,598
I promise

1165
01:27:45,168 --> 01:27:46,312
Helen?

1166
01:27:48,785 --> 01:27:50,279
Helen!

1167
01:27:53,521 --> 01:27:54,928
Helen!

1168
01:28:24,239 --> 01:28:25,702
Can you hear me?

1169
01:28:27,408 --> 01:28:29,132
Can you hear me, Helen?

1170
01:28:57,038 --> 01:28:58,730
I'm sorry I'm late
Ah, no problem

1171
01:28:58,831 --> 01:29:01,801
I'm pleased to say your mother's showing
some signs of improvement this morning

1172
01:29:01,904 --> 01:29:03,944
She's sitting up
and she's had a full breakfast

1173
01:29:04,047 --> 01:29:05,258
That's great

1174
01:29:25,551 --> 01:29:26,981
Helen, I swear...

1175
01:29:33,263 --> 01:29:35,052
I'll do anything you want, Helen

1176
01:29:36,495 --> 01:29:37,739
Will you?

1177
01:29:40,111 --> 01:29:41,965
In that case,
I want you to stand up...

1178
01:29:43,055 --> 01:29:44,682
...walk over to the door...

1179
01:29:45,263 --> 01:29:47,402
...open it... walk through it...

1180
01:29:48,271 --> 01:29:49,963
...then close it behind you

1181
01:30:05,648 --> 01:30:06,760
Ta-ta, mum

1182
01:30:13,421 --> 01:30:15,081
Call us if you have
any problems at all

1183
01:30:15,182 --> 01:30:16,012
Thank you

1184
01:30:16,110 --> 01:30:19,242
You're very fortunate, Helen.
You had a lucky escape

1185
01:30:19,342 --> 01:30:21,132
Say that again

1186
01:30:22,381 --> 01:30:23,244
Thank you

1187
01:31:11,501 --> 01:31:12,909
Thank you

1188
01:31:13,006 --> 01:31:15,875
Cheer up. You know
what the Monty Python boys say

1189
01:31:15,980 --> 01:31:18,086
"Nobody expects
the spanish Inquisition"
