Once upon this same earth,

2
00:02:28,685 --> 00:02:31,121
beneath this same sun,

3
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:33,061
long before you...

4
00:02:33,161 --> 00:02:37,100
...before the ape and the elephant as well,

5
00:02:37,168 --> 00:02:41,130
before the wolf,
the bison, the whale,

6
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:44,611
before the mammoth and the mastodon...

7
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,709
...in the time of the dinosaurs.

8
00:02:49,222 --> 00:02:50,591
Come on.

9
00:02:50,691 --> 00:02:53,156
Dinosaurs were of two kinds -

10
00:02:53,196 --> 00:02:58,160
Some had flat teeth
and ate the leaves of trees.

11
00:02:58,238 --> 00:03:01,676
Some had sharp teeth for eating meat.

12
00:03:01,743 --> 00:03:04,647
They preyed upon the leaf-eaters.

13
00:03:04,716 --> 00:03:07,151
Then leaves began to die.

14
00:03:07,221 --> 00:03:11,160
The mighty beasts,
who appeared to rule earth,

15
00:03:11,228 --> 00:03:14,666
were ruled, in truth,
by the leaf.

16
00:03:14,733 --> 00:03:16,136
Desperate for food,

17
00:03:16,236 --> 00:03:18,428
some dinosaur herds...

18
00:03:18,429 --> 00:03:19,965
...struck out toward the west,

19
00:03:20,065 --> 00:03:22,469
searching for their Great Valley,

20
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:25,540
a land still lush and green.

21
00:03:25,608 --> 00:03:28,603
lt was a journey toward life.

22
00:03:36,126 --> 00:03:39,565
lt was a march of many dangers.

23
00:03:39,633 --> 00:03:41,537
Sharpteeth stalked the herds,

24
00:03:41,637 --> 00:03:44,540
waiting to seize any who strayed.

25
00:03:44,608 --> 00:03:49,139
The leaf-eaters stopped only
to hatch their young.

26
00:03:56,462 --> 00:03:58,462

Ha ha ha.

All that remained of his herd...

61
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,296
...was his mother,

62
00:07:25,396 --> 00:07:27,333

63
00:07:27,433 --> 00:07:29,835
He knew them by sight,

64
00:07:29,904 --> 00:07:32,841
by scent and by their love.

65
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:36,370
He knew they would be together always.

66
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:39,887
Now, you be careful,
my Littlefoot.

l'm sorry, my dear.

73
00:08:12,579 --> 00:08:14,981
The land has been changing.

74
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:21,483
That is why we must walk
as far as we can each day...

75
00:08:21,561 --> 00:08:24,589
...until we reach the Great Valley.

more than you could ever eat...

181
00:14:57,997 --> 00:14:59,400
This way.

182
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,402
Mm-mmm.

183
00:15:00,502 --> 00:15:04,031
Come back.
You're going the wrong way.

184
00:15:06,011 --> 00:15:08,011
Aah.

185
00:15:08,716 --> 00:15:09,651
Whoa.

186
00:15:09,751 --> 00:15:10,620
Ohh.

Aah.

209
00:17:42,286 --> 00:17:46,225
ln this time of the clash of continents,

210
00:17:46,293 --> 00:17:48,758
an earthquake split the land.

211
00:17:48,797 --> 00:17:52,759
Herds were divided,
families were cut in two.

212
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:56,748
Littlefoot was separated
from his grandparents.

Mama. Daddy.

215
00:18:06,862 --> 00:18:10,665
Cera was on one side of the divide,

216
00:18:10,736 --> 00:18:13,707
her parents were on the other.

217

Mother.

218
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:29,498
Mother.

00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,240
Uh.

220
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:38,986
Mother?

221
00:18:39,086 --> 00:18:41,214
Where are you?

222
00:18:42,391 --> 00:18:44,391
Oh.

223
00:18:45,396 --> 00:18:47,396
Mother.

224
00:18:48,569 --> 00:18:49,471
Mother?

225
00:18:49,571 --> 00:18:50,506
Oh.

226
00:18:50,606 --> 00:18:52,872
Please get up.

227
00:18:52,943 --> 00:18:54,943
l'm...

228
00:18:55,414 --> 00:18:57,819
...not sure l can, Littlefoot.

229
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,321
Yes, you can.

230
00:18:59,421 --> 00:19:01,421
Get up.

231
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,440
Dear, sweet Littlefoot,

232
00:19:12,478 --> 00:19:16,884
do you remember the way
to the Great Valley?

233
00:19:16,952 --> 00:19:18,354
l guess so,

234
00:19:18,454 --> 00:19:21,426
but why do l have to know?

235
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:24,260
You're going to be with me.

236
00:19:24,332 --> 00:19:26,332
l'll be with you,

237
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:29,273
even if you can't see me.

238
00:19:29,341 --> 00:19:33,781
What do you mean if l can't see you?

239
00:19:33,848 --> 00:19:36,284
l can always see you.

240
00:19:36,353 --> 00:19:39,917
Littlefoot,
let your heart guide you.

241
00:19:41,362 --> 00:19:43,362
lt whispers.

242
00:19:43,866 --> 00:19:45,866
So listen closely.

243
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:52,811
Mother? Mother?

244
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:18,995
Mmm.

245
00:20:19,095 --> 00:20:21,095
Mmmmm.

246
00:20:22,534 --> 00:20:24,534
Hey.

247
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,176
What's going on here?

248
00:20:27,276 --> 00:20:28,378
[Crying]

249
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:30,538
What's your problem?

250
00:20:30,615 --> 00:20:32,084
You're not hurt.

251
00:20:32,184 --> 00:20:34,211
lt's not fair.

252
00:20:34,288 --> 00:20:36,492
She should have known better.

253
00:20:36,592 --> 00:20:39,028
That was a sharptooth.

254
00:20:39,097 --> 00:20:41,097
lt's all her fault.

255
00:20:41,133 --> 00:20:43,133
All whose fault?

256
00:20:43,171 --> 00:20:44,239
Mother's.

257
00:20:44,339 --> 00:20:47,139
Oh...

258
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:51,309
...l see. l see.

259
00:20:51,385 --> 00:20:55,222
Why did l wander so far from home?

260
00:20:55,292 --> 00:20:57,728
Oh, it's not your fault.

261
00:20:57,796 --> 00:21:00,261
lt's not your mother's fault.

262
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:03,466
You pay attention to old Rooter.

263
00:21:03,539 --> 00:21:06,670
lt is nobody's fault.

264
00:21:06,745 --> 00:21:10,148
The great circle of life has begun,

265
00:21:10,218 --> 00:21:11,653
but, you see,

266
00:21:11,753 --> 00:21:16,160
not all of us arrive together at the end.

267
00:21:16,229 --> 00:21:17,631
What'll l do?

268
00:21:17,731 --> 00:21:20,167
l miss her so much.

269
00:21:20,236 --> 00:21:22,236
You'll always miss her,

270
00:21:22,272 --> 00:21:25,176
but she'll always be with you...

271
00:21:25,245 --> 00:21:28,705
...if you remember what she taught you.

272
00:21:28,783 --> 00:21:31,248
You'll never really be apart,

273
00:21:31,255 --> 00:21:35,194
for you're still a part of each other.

274
00:21:35,262 --> 00:21:36,832
My tummy hurts.

275
00:21:36,932 --> 00:21:41,634
Well, that, too,
will go in time, little fella...

276
00:21:41,706 --> 00:21:43,706
...only in time.

At first,

285
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:56,738
Littlefoot could only think about his mother.

286
00:22:56,838 --> 00:22:59,243
He hardly noticed his hunger...

287
00:22:59,343 --> 00:23:03,841
...and forgot that he must
reach the Great Valley.

Littlefoot.

Dear Littlefoot,

294
00:24:16,842 --> 00:24:21,373
do you remember the way
to the Great Valley?

295
00:24:22,885 --> 00:24:24,756
Follow the bright circle...

296
00:24:24,856 --> 00:24:29,820
...past the great rock
that looks like a long-neck...

297
00:24:29,898 --> 00:24:32,958
...and past the mountains that burn.

298
00:24:34,874 --> 00:24:37,902
l'll be in your heart,
Littlefoot.

299
00:24:38,881 --> 00:24:41,009
Let your heart guide you.

300
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,804
[Gasp]

301
00:24:51,904 --> 00:24:53,904

00:24:56,645 --> 00:24:58,706
Mother.

303
00:24:58,782 --> 00:25:00,782
Hee hee hee.

304
00:25:02,187 --> 00:25:03,256
Mother.

Heh heh. lt's you.

306
00:25:06,596 --> 00:25:08,332
Wait, Mother.

307
00:25:08,432 --> 00:25:10,432
Wait.

308
00:25:25,963 --> 00:25:28,367
Then Littlefoot knew for certain...

309
00:25:28,467 --> 00:25:30,467
...that he was alone...

310
00:25:30,471 --> 00:25:33,409
...and that though the Great Valley...

311
00:25:33,509 --> 00:25:34,879
...was far away...

312
00:25:34,979 --> 00:25:36,883
...and the journey perilous,

313
00:25:36,983 --> 00:25:39,453
he'd have to find his way,

314
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:43,425
or the chain of life would be broken.

Nothing. Where are you going?

l'm going to find my own kind.

They're on the other side.

You can't climb up the other side.

Maybe you can't.

323
00:26:06,668 --> 00:26:07,603
Uhh.

l'm going to the Great Valley.

We could... help each other.

00:26:14,214 --> 00:26:15,650
Ha. A three-horn...

so go away.

Three-horns can be very dangerous.

337

They only talk with other three-horns,
