1
00:00:55,723 --> 00:00:58,309
Come on, let's go.

2
00:00:58,393 --> 00:01:00,770
Come on.

3
00:01:00,853 --> 00:01:03,773
Pick a spot.

4
00:01:03,856 --> 00:01:07,277
Take a dump.
Let's go.

5
00:01:13,241 --> 00:01:15,951
Who's that?

6
00:01:15,952 --> 00:01:18,329
Hey.

7
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:20,790
Evening.

8
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:22,457
Hey, Vaughn.

9
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:24,961
<i>Hey, Jack.</i>

10
00:01:25,044 --> 00:01:27,255
I see he's got you
well trained.

11
00:01:27,338 --> 00:01:30,632
Who's walking who, right?

12
00:01:32,427 --> 00:01:34,804
Whew.

13
00:01:34,887 --> 00:01:36,639
How you, uh...

14
00:01:36,723 --> 00:01:38,766
how you holding up?

15
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:41,519
It's day by day, you know.

16
00:01:41,603 --> 00:01:43,605
But I'm gonna be all right.

17
00:01:43,688 --> 00:01:45,480
Yeah, these things take time.

18
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:48,026
<i>Hmm.</i>

19
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:51,486
Well, exercise helps.
I've been running a lot.

20
00:01:51,487 --> 00:01:54,323
And I've been lifting weights.

21
00:01:54,324 --> 00:01:55,824
Can you tell?

22
00:01:55,825 --> 00:01:57,368
I got two tickets
to the gun show.

23
00:02:00,913 --> 00:02:02,832
You're a funny son
of a bitch, Vaughn.

24
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:08,504
No, I mean I got two
tickets to the gun show.

25
00:02:08,588 --> 00:02:14,843
Now look, I've got my van
parked right down the street.

26
00:02:14,844 --> 00:02:19,057
You and I are going
to take a little jog.

27
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,350
What's this about, man?

28
00:02:21,351 --> 00:02:22,810
I think you know
what this is about.

29
00:02:22,894 --> 00:02:24,562
No, I don't know
what this is about!

30
00:02:24,646 --> 00:02:28,733
I think you do... know...
what... this... is... about!

31
00:02:32,612 --> 00:02:34,364
Turn your ass around...

32
00:02:34,447 --> 00:02:36,908
and we're gonna
run up the road.

33
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:38,201
All right, Vaughn.

34
00:02:38,284 --> 00:02:39,452
Come on.

35
00:02:40,662 --> 00:02:43,748
Turn around.

36
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:44,832
Turn around!
Let's go.

37
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:46,084
Damn it, Vaughn!

38
00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:47,543
Turn around.
Let's go.

39
00:02:47,627 --> 00:02:49,378
<i>Go home, Max.
All right!</i>

40
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:50,880
<i>Come on, let's go come on...</i>

41
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:52,256
We're gonna jog.

42
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,175
We're gonna jog.
Run.

43
00:02:54,258 --> 00:02:55,176
What are you doin'?

44
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:56,260
Run.
Run!

45
00:02:56,344 --> 00:02:57,553
Let's go.
Run.

46
00:02:57,637 --> 00:02:59,847
Come on, let's go.
Run.

47
00:03:04,185 --> 00:03:07,772
Almost done.

48
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:11,442
You dug that pretty quick.

49
00:03:11,526 --> 00:03:14,112
But then again,
it is fresh dirt.

50
00:03:18,908 --> 00:03:21,536
All right. One more.

51
00:03:22,704 --> 00:03:27,249
<i>One more.</i>

52
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,459
All done.

53
00:03:32,296 --> 00:03:33,923
Put the shovel right over here.

54
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:34,757
Right there.

55
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:38,970
What?

56
00:03:39,053 --> 00:03:39,804
Come on...

57
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:40,888
Hey!

58
00:03:46,227 --> 00:03:47,769
Open it.

59
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,397
Oh, Jesus Christ.

60
00:03:51,107 --> 00:03:52,108
No, man.

61
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:53,776
Open it.

62
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,111
Don't make me do this, friend.

63
00:03:55,194 --> 00:03:56,988
Open it.

64
00:04:04,537 --> 00:04:05,538
Ooh-hoo.

65
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:07,540
What the fuck?

66
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,602
God!
Ohhh!

67
00:04:27,685 --> 00:04:28,936
Comfy?

68
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,646
Vaughn, don% do this, man.

69
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:33,524
Look... I swear to God...

70
00:04:33,608 --> 00:04:36,778
no one's going to know
anything about this.

71
00:04:36,861 --> 00:04:39,906
I'll never tell anybody.
I'll never tell a soul.

72
00:04:39,989 --> 00:04:42,700
Oh. Oh, please.

73
00:04:42,784 --> 00:04:45,328
Please. Oh, no.
Please don't do this.

74
00:04:46,913 --> 00:04:48,831
Vaughn! Look, man,
we go way back!

75
00:04:48,832 --> 00:04:50,999
What, it's gonna be
our little secret?

76
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,544
Yes, it is.

77
00:04:53,628 --> 00:04:54,796
I don't think so.

78
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:56,255
Come on.

79
00:04:56,339 --> 00:04:58,841
I'll tell you what,
maggot-meat...

80
00:04:58,925 --> 00:05:01,052
What?

81
00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:03,554
I'll leave the light
on for you.

82
00:05:03,638 --> 00:05:05,223
Jesus!

83
00:05:06,183 --> 00:05:07,391
Vaughn!

84
00:05:07,475 --> 00:05:09,894
Woo-hoo.

85
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:16,651
Fuck.

86
00:05:16,734 --> 00:05:19,987
Vaughn!

87
00:05:20,071 --> 00:05:21,823
Vaughn!

88
00:05:31,415 --> 00:05:32,708
Vaughn!

89
00:05:35,503 --> 00:05:37,212
I don't have air!

90
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:49,433
So someone give me an impression
of The Telltale Heart.

91
00:05:49,517 --> 00:05:50,351
Who wants to start?

92
00:05:54,772 --> 00:05:55,857
Danny?

93
00:05:58,943 --> 00:06:01,736
I thought the blue
eye was kinda cool.

94
00:06:01,737 --> 00:06:04,239
Okay.
Anything else?

95
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,408
He really loves
exclamation points.

96
00:06:07,994 --> 00:06:09,453
All right.

97
00:06:09,537 --> 00:06:11,622
Hey, Travis.
What about you?

98
00:06:11,706 --> 00:06:14,208
<i>What is Poe really telling
us about this murderer?</i>

99
00:06:14,292 --> 00:06:16,751
Hmm. I don't know.

100
00:06:16,752 --> 00:06:18,588
Oh, come on, Travis...

101
00:06:18,671 --> 00:06:21,173
we don't have optional
participation in this class.

102
00:06:21,257 --> 00:06:25,136
<i>Say you were encouraging a friend to read it.
What would you tell him?</i>

103
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:29,599
I'd say... you're inside
this killer's head.

104
00:06:29,682 --> 00:06:32,894
The longer you're in it,
the scarier it gets.

105
00:06:32,977 --> 00:06:37,315
Why is it scary?

106
00:06:37,398 --> 00:06:39,817
Because he's crazy.

107
00:06:39,901 --> 00:06:42,277
Are you sure?

108
00:06:42,278 --> 00:06:46,657
Well, he keeps
telling us that he's not.

109
00:06:48,868 --> 00:06:51,787
<i>Abby, what do you think?</i>

110
00:06:51,871 --> 00:06:53,664
I would have
to agree with Travis.

111
00:06:53,748 --> 00:06:55,875
He's definitely crazy.

112
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:58,669
Anyone that would kill somebody
just because they had a funny eye.

113
00:06:58,753 --> 00:07:01,088
Damn right. And he
slab-chops the dude.

114
00:07:01,172 --> 00:07:04,133
So, Brian, you're saying he
cuts him into little pieces.

115
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:08,429
Right. Then he hides it
all underneath the floor.

116
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:11,473
So why would he go to all that
trouble to hide the body...

117
00:07:11,474 --> 00:07:13,267
if he's gonna confess?

118
00:07:13,351 --> 00:07:15,811
I guess because he knew
the cops could hear it.

119
00:07:15,895 --> 00:07:17,980
You know?
The heart beating and all?

120
00:07:18,064 --> 00:07:21,316
But Miss Moore, I don't
think it was beating.

121
00:07:21,317 --> 00:07:23,778
I think he just thought it was
beating because he was mental.

122
00:07:23,861 --> 00:07:27,155
Yeah, he was nuts,
so he was hearing shit.

123
00:07:27,156 --> 00:07:30,659
Stuff.

124
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,662
Okay. Okay.

125
00:07:32,745 --> 00:07:35,873
So what would make somebody
keep hearing something...

126
00:07:35,957 --> 00:07:38,668
a sound, if it's
all in his head...

127
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:43,673
that would drive
him to confess?

128
00:07:43,756 --> 00:07:45,383
Travis.

129
00:07:45,466 --> 00:07:51,472
Uh, it was, uh...
guilt.

130
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:56,727
<i>Don't forget, we continue
with Macbeth next week.</i>

131
00:07:56,811 --> 00:07:59,480
I want you to review
Act Ill this weekend.

132
00:07:59,563 --> 00:08:03,025
To get us in the mood, Travis
and Abby will do a scene...

133
00:08:03,109 --> 00:08:04,860
as Macbeth and Lady Macbeth.

134
00:08:04,944 --> 00:08:08,406
Maybe you can come by for
pizza, like sevenish?

135
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:10,741
Sure. We should
really go that way.

136
00:08:10,825 --> 00:08:12,868
Okay, Brian.
Hold on.

137
00:08:12,952 --> 00:08:15,997
Ooh. "Never shake thy
gory locks at me."

138
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,665
What?

139
00:08:17,748 --> 00:08:20,876
Sit worthy, my friends.
My lord often thus.

140
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,170
<i>Macbeth.
Yeah.</i>

141
00:08:23,254 --> 00:08:25,381
No one has any idea what
you two are talking about.

142
00:08:25,464 --> 00:08:26,924
Isn't that where
he sees the ghost?

143
00:08:27,008 --> 00:08:29,760
Yeah.

144
00:08:29,844 --> 00:08:32,013
You won't have any trouble
nailing that scene.

145
00:08:32,096 --> 00:08:34,056
What do you mean?

146
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,850
Nothing.

147
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:37,268
Uh, does anyone else
getting tired of pizza?

148
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:38,519
Danny, you can get wings.

149
00:08:38,602 --> 00:08:40,312
Abby, we should go.

150
00:08:40,396 --> 00:08:41,564
What are you talking about?

151
00:08:41,647 --> 00:08:44,358
It should come easy...

152
00:08:44,442 --> 00:08:47,403
since I saw something strange
the night my sister died.

153
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:49,780
Like a... like
a ghost?

154
00:08:49,864 --> 00:08:51,907
I don't know what it was.

155
00:08:51,991 --> 00:08:53,492
But I saw something.

156
00:08:53,576 --> 00:08:54,869
No, no, please,
we're all friends here.

157
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:56,203
Why don't you share with us?

158
00:08:56,287 --> 00:08:57,830
<i>Brian.</i>

159
00:08:57,913 --> 00:08:59,582
No, I'm just curious.
Let me guess.

160
00:08:59,665 --> 00:09:01,042
<i>You called your
ghost Richard Headen...</i>

161
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,460
you know, in
Dickhead for short.

162
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:03,544
Kinda like what they call you.

163
00:09:03,627 --> 00:09:05,546
Mm. You're funny.

164
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:07,214
Aren't I?
I'm a funny guy.

165
00:09:07,298 --> 00:09:09,050
Brian, it's his sister.

166
00:09:09,133 --> 00:09:10,551
Oh, fine, he brought it up.
It's not my fault.

167
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:11,469
Nice, Brian.

168
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:19,060
Travis.

169
00:09:20,644 --> 00:09:23,230
Mr. Sovic.

170
00:09:23,314 --> 00:09:25,066
You were supposed
to come see me.

171
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:28,486
Yeah.

172
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:31,614
Travis, you've never come out for
track or baseball, have you?

173
00:09:31,697 --> 00:09:33,324
Nope.

174
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:35,242
All you do is P.E.

175
00:09:35,326 --> 00:09:37,661
Yeah, just P.E.

176
00:09:37,745 --> 00:09:39,663
Track tryouts are next week.

177
00:09:39,747 --> 00:09:40,623
I'd like to see you out there.

178
00:09:40,706 --> 00:09:41,707
I gotta go...

179
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:43,958
Listen a second.

180
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:45,794
You know what's
neat about track?

181
00:09:45,795 --> 00:09:47,171
<i>Hmm.</i>

182
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:48,798
There's always a goal.

183
00:09:48,881 --> 00:09:51,132
You're always running
towards something.

184
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:52,468
Now, you see...

185
00:09:52,551 --> 00:09:54,804
I think you'd be good at that.

186
00:09:54,887 --> 00:09:57,014
Just not interested.

187
00:09:57,098 --> 00:09:58,265
Not interested, huh?

188
00:09:58,349 --> 00:10:00,975
I see.

189
00:10:00,976 --> 00:10:02,520
I guess I've been
wasting my time.

190
00:10:09,235 --> 00:10:12,487
What was all that crap?

191
00:10:12,488 --> 00:10:14,489
The hell if I know.

192
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:15,699
Let's go.

193
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:22,957
Sovic's a creep.

194
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,167
Yeah.

195
00:10:25,251 --> 00:10:26,877
Is he even married?

196
00:10:26,961 --> 00:10:28,295
It wouldn't surprise
me if he wasn't.

197
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:30,548
Probably not, man.

198
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:32,842
Ahh, I think he's got
a thing for Miss Moore.

199
00:10:32,925 --> 00:10:36,846
Ohhh, that'd be interesting.

200
00:10:36,929 --> 00:10:38,472
Gotta mow Ely's lawn tomorrow?

201
00:10:38,556 --> 00:10:40,266
Yep.

202
00:10:40,349 --> 00:10:43,561
Doesn't it ever creep you
out being around him?

203
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:44,979
Not really.

204
00:10:45,062 --> 00:10:47,398
Dude. With
those dead bodies?

205
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:52,653
<i>I'm pretty sure Ely
keeps them in the funeral home.</i>

206
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:03,038
Mr. Ely?

207
00:11:03,122 --> 00:11:05,833
- Boo!
- I'm all done.

208
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:13,924
Here.

209
00:11:24,018 --> 00:11:28,189
Travis, you didn't set
the mower low enough.

210
00:11:28,272 --> 00:11:29,773
I thought I did it
the way you wanted.

211
00:11:29,774 --> 00:11:32,693
What I said
on the last cutting...

212
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:34,903
is that I wanted
it really low...

213
00:11:34,904 --> 00:11:37,238
so that it looks
good until spring.

214
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:39,450
Now, wasn't that clear?

215
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:40,659
I guess.

216
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:45,956
Well, you just have to do
it over again, that's...

217
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,333
Yes, sir.

218
00:11:54,465 --> 00:11:55,924
You know, uh...

219
00:11:55,925 --> 00:11:58,426
my dear wife, Rosemary...

220
00:11:58,427 --> 00:12:00,638
taught your sister...

221
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:02,430
um, what was
her... Ellen?

222
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,891
Erin.

223
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:07,478
Erin. Taught her
in the sixth grade.

224
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:12,816
Hm. Yeah.

225
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:17,238
Here you go, just put
it right in here.

226
00:12:17,321 --> 00:12:22,284
Said she was a really
smart young lady.

227
00:12:22,368 --> 00:12:27,289
Very special.

228
00:12:27,373 --> 00:12:32,086
Now they're both gone.

229
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:33,337
Here, back to work.

230
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:51,772
Hey, Travis.

231
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:53,649
Hey.

232
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:56,360
So, Danny said that you
weren't gonna go tonight.

233
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:59,487
Yeah, got some homework to do.

234
00:12:59,488 --> 00:13:01,907
Travis, you can do homework
whenever you want.

235
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:09,998
So...

236
00:13:09,999 --> 00:13:12,209
So what?

237
00:13:12,293 --> 00:13:16,504
It's just... that you
promised that...

238
00:13:16,505 --> 00:13:21,218
you would tell me about
the whole ghost thing.

239
00:13:21,302 --> 00:13:25,556
I just... don't want this
getting around school.

240
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:28,349
I'm not gonna tell anyone.

241
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,351
I promise.

242
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:35,690
<i>[Travis, off? One night,
when I was seven years old.</i>

243
00:13:35,691 --> 00:13:39,194
<i>Some strange noises woke me up.</i>

244
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:42,531
<i>They were coming
from my sister's room.</i>

245
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,239
Erin?

246
00:14:35,334 --> 00:14:36,210
Erin?

247
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:51,225
Erin.

248
00:14:55,104 --> 00:14:57,981
Leave my sister alone!

249
00:14:58,065 --> 00:15:00,943
<i>My mom called 9-1-1.</i>

250
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:02,444
<i>I knew there was
nothing they could do.</i>

251
00:15:02,528 --> 00:15:06,281
Don't go, Erin.
Please don't go.

252
00:15:06,365 --> 00:15:08,992
<i>I knew she was gone</i>

253
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:12,162
I'm sorry, Travis.

254
00:15:12,246 --> 00:15:16,834
I just stood there.

255
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:18,517
Frozen.

256
00:15:21,797 --> 00:15:24,800
<i>I'm sure you couldn't have
changed anything if you tried...</i>

257
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:31,849
She'd be 21 now.

258
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:39,814
Our minister came
over that night...

259
00:15:39,815 --> 00:15:42,526
to try to comfort my mom...

260
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:45,153
try to make her
not feel guilty...

261
00:15:45,154 --> 00:15:48,866
that this was meant to be.

262
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:50,576
What kind of crap is that?

263
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:54,204
Did you try and tell
your mom what happened?

264
00:15:54,288 --> 00:15:57,875
<i>Yeah.</i>

265
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:02,129
First she believed me,
then, um...

266
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:08,385
it was just to calm me down.

267
00:16:08,469 --> 00:16:10,637
I wonder if my mom
would even believe me...

268
00:16:10,721 --> 00:16:12,681
if I told her I saw
something like that.

269
00:16:16,727 --> 00:16:21,522
Probably not.

270
00:16:21,523 --> 00:16:22,858
But I'm glad you told me.

271
00:16:52,054 --> 00:16:58,893
Hear it not, Duncan,
is a knell...

272
00:16:58,894 --> 00:17:00,687
or for hell.

273
00:17:00,771 --> 00:17:02,773
Something like that.

274
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:07,069
Thou hath made me drunk,
hath made me bold.

275
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:09,154
Um....
Hmm.

276
00:17:09,238 --> 00:17:12,366
Well, at least it seems like we
have the majority of it down.

277
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:14,201
Yeah.
You do, anyway.

278
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:32,927
Oh, El Camino!
God, I'm awesome.

279
00:17:32,928 --> 00:17:33,971
Your car is not that nice.

280
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:35,806
My car is amazing.

281
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:37,140
That will take you any day.

282
00:17:37,224 --> 00:17:38,350
No. No, it will not.

283
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:39,560
<i>El Camino is king.</i>

284
00:17:39,643 --> 00:17:40,852
Yo, it's the Macbeth's.

285
00:17:40,936 --> 00:17:43,772
Ha, ha, how are you guys?

286
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:46,149
You guys are really into
this acting thing, huh?

287
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:48,819
I am too.
The ghost, in... in the play...

288
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:50,612
he gets stabbed
by Macbeth, right?

289
00:17:50,613 --> 00:17:53,114
Well, Macbeth had him killed.

290
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:55,409
Perfect. I'll
play the ghost.

291
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:57,952
You want to play the ghost?

292
00:17:57,953 --> 00:17:59,913
Yeah.

293
00:17:59,997 --> 00:18:02,916
Yeah. Sure,
why not?

294
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,752
Right? No, I can come on with
the ketchup on my head...

295
00:18:05,836 --> 00:18:07,921
and then at the end,
I will lick the blood.

296
00:18:08,005 --> 00:18:11,091
Oh, sort of like a Buffy
Macbeth kind of thing.

297
00:18:11,174 --> 00:18:13,010
Hell, yes.

298
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:15,095
Okay, all right.
That sounds great. Can we go?

299
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:17,347
I want to get to Chestnut
Square before it gets late.

300
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:21,143
Yeah.

301
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:22,977
Abby? Back
by ten.

302
00:18:22,978 --> 00:18:24,812
<i>Leave your cell phone on.</i>

303
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:25,897
Yes, Mom.

304
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:27,149
Thank you.
Brian.

305
00:18:27,232 --> 00:18:29,359
Hey.

306
00:18:29,443 --> 00:18:31,486
One passenger at a time with that
new license of yours, please.

307
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:33,947
Of course, Mrs. Harwood.

308
00:18:34,031 --> 00:18:37,075
And I always take good
care of my passenger.

309
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:38,577
Thank you, Brian.

310
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,454
I love that sweater,
Mrs. Harwood.

311
00:18:42,205 --> 00:18:43,497
Okay, Danny.

312
00:18:47,002 --> 00:18:49,003
Your mom's so hot, I'm sorry.

313
00:18:49,004 --> 00:18:51,840
Really? That's
my mother.

314
00:18:51,923 --> 00:18:53,884
Come on.

315
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:55,508
She's hot. What's with the
be back by ten shit, though?

316
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:56,553
Don't get me started.

317
00:18:56,637 --> 00:18:58,180
That's early.

318
00:18:58,263 --> 00:18:59,681
Come on, Abby.

319
00:18:59,765 --> 00:19:01,224
You got one more strike.

320
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:02,976
Let's see if you can do it.

321
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,478
Don't you listen to
him, Abby, all right?

322
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:05,687
He's just trying
to psych you out.

323
00:19:05,771 --> 00:19:07,022
Watch and learn, Brian.

324
00:19:07,023 --> 00:19:09,399
You get it, girl.

325
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:12,069
Go, go! go!

326
00:19:16,114 --> 00:19:17,741
I'm pretty sure I just won.

327
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:19,910
Just saying.

328
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:21,119
Travis, did the bowling ghost

329
00:19:21,203 --> 00:19:22,412
knock the pins over?

330
00:19:22,496 --> 00:19:24,164
That's not really funny.

331
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:25,705
It's just a joke.
Calm down.

332
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,000
Just get out of my face.

333
00:19:27,084 --> 00:19:28,251
Whoa, hey dude.

334
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:29,836
Calm down.
Brian...

335
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,505
No, no, I'm the
victim here, okay?

336
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:33,757
It's his fault.
We're just bowling here.

337
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,717
<i>We are just bowling.</i>

338
00:19:35,801 --> 00:19:37,219
All right, I'll stop, I'll stop.

339
00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:38,637
Sit down.

340
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,721
<i>I don't wanna sit down.</i>

341
00:19:39,805 --> 00:19:40,681
<i>You sit down.</i>

342
00:19:40,764 --> 00:19:41,890
<i>Brian.</i>

343
00:19:41,973 --> 00:19:42,766
Have you seen them?

344
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:44,351
No, no.

345
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:46,353
Real ghosts? Like
just dancing around?

346
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:47,854
Colin saw them
when he was walking by.

347
00:19:47,938 --> 00:19:49,314
He said they
were all shimmering.

348
00:19:49,398 --> 00:19:50,941
Can you guys lay off already?

349
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:52,776
My God!
We're not talking about Travis.

350
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:55,195
Jesus. Okay, so where did
Colin see these things?

351
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:57,030
Outside, in the front lawn.

352
00:19:57,114 --> 00:19:58,865
He said they drifted
in through a wall...

353
00:19:58,949 --> 00:20:00,617
and he could see them
through the window.

354
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:03,704
That is complete horse shit.

355
00:20:03,787 --> 00:20:05,288
I know. It's what he said.

356
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:06,289
Who's house is this at?

357
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:07,499
Vaughn Ely's.

358
00:20:07,582 --> 00:20:09,000
Travis mows his lawn.

359
00:20:09,084 --> 00:20:10,836
I've never seen
anything like that.

360
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:12,129
You mow his lawn
during the day.

361
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:14,005
Ghosts come out at night.

362
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:15,465
It's probably
Ely walking around...

363
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:16,425
with a sheet on top
of his head.

364
00:20:18,135 --> 00:20:20,303
So wanna go check it out?

365
00:20:20,387 --> 00:20:21,596
Really?

366
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,265
Really.

367
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:24,599
No, no, no.
You are not driving this car.

368
00:20:24,683 --> 00:20:27,561
Brian. Give
me the keys.

369
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:29,062
All right, let's go!

370
00:20:31,857 --> 00:20:34,443
<i>Oh, it's so dark tonight.
Oooh...</i>

371
00:20:34,526 --> 00:20:36,777
<i>S0 what's Ely's deal?</i>

372
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:38,739
He's all right.

373
00:20:38,822 --> 00:20:41,116
He's a freakin' weirdo, man.

374
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:42,576
You gotta be if you're...

375
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:44,578
one of those,
uh, "morticianers?"

376
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:46,163
Yeah, yeah, morticianer.

377
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:48,290
Yeah, that...
that guy.

378
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:50,623
Sticking those tubes in people
and sucking all that snot out.

379
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:51,835
That's gross, Brian.

380
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:53,461
Oh, you're welcome.

381
00:20:53,462 --> 00:20:55,046
Was he married to
the mayor's sister?

382
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,132
Yeah, but she died
a couple years back.

383
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:59,342
What does he pay
you to mow his lawn?

384
00:20:59,426 --> 00:21:00,844
Twenty bucks.

385
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:02,512
Twenty... twenty bucks,
that's it?

386
00:21:02,596 --> 00:21:04,347
Yeah, I mean, I
only mow the front.

387
00:21:04,431 --> 00:21:05,849
Why?

388
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:07,225
He never lets me
in the back yard.

389
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:08,685
I figure he does it himself.

390
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:10,562
That's weird.

391
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:12,522
I would completely believe
this house is haunted.

392
00:21:12,606 --> 00:21:14,649
It gives off such a weird vibe.

393
00:21:14,733 --> 00:21:16,526
I think you just like
to be scared, Abby.

394
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:19,153
<i>Brian.</i>

395
00:21:19,154 --> 00:21:20,322
<i>No, seriously.</i>

396
00:21:20,323 --> 00:21:22,699
No, Brian, look.

397
00:21:22,783 --> 00:21:24,034
Shit.

398
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:29,330
<i>See? I
told you.</i>

399
00:21:29,331 --> 00:21:31,958
He lives alone, right?

400
00:21:32,042 --> 00:21:33,710
<i>Yeah.</i>

401
00:21:33,794 --> 00:21:37,004
<i>Yeah, so who is that?</i>

402
00:21:37,005 --> 00:21:39,466
This house is so haunted.

403
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:43,720
Nobody's gonna believe this.

404
00:21:43,804 --> 00:21:45,347
I'm still not convinced.

405
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:47,181
Brian, we all saw it.

406
00:21:47,182 --> 00:21:49,017
Maybe one was Ely, but
the other one was...

407
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,811
How do we know it
was a freakin' ghost?

408
00:21:50,894 --> 00:21:52,437
Then what was it, Brian?

409
00:21:52,521 --> 00:21:53,980
I don't know, maybe
Ely had a hot date.

410
00:21:54,064 --> 00:21:55,899
You know, he was
dancing with her...

411
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:57,359
before he mixed the milkshake.

412
00:21:57,442 --> 00:21:59,193
It was not a hot date.

413
00:21:59,194 --> 00:22:02,239
It was just...
something wrong.

414
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:04,199
Well, maybe if
she was a ghost...

415
00:22:04,282 --> 00:22:05,742
she'll show up
in class in a second.

416
00:22:05,826 --> 00:22:10,705
Give that Macbeth
ghost some company.

417
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:12,916
Are you a man?

418
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:15,335
Aye. And
a bold one...

419
00:22:15,418 --> 00:22:19,047
that dare look on that which
might appall the devil.

420
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:20,841
<i>A shame itself.</i>

421
00:22:20,924 --> 00:22:23,093
Why do you make such faces?

422
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:25,929
When all's done, you
look but on a stool.

423
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:28,557
Prithee, see there!

424
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,600
Behold! Look! Look!
How say you?

425
00:22:32,853 --> 00:22:34,563
If charnel houses and graves
send those that we bury back

426
00:22:34,646 --> 00:22:37,190
then our monuments shall
be the maws of kites.

427
00:23:02,382 --> 00:23:04,885
Asshole.

428
00:23:04,968 --> 00:23:08,471
You know I don't like that.

429
00:23:08,555 --> 00:23:10,891
I know that grade's
shit, but who cares?

430
00:23:10,974 --> 00:23:11,892
I do.

431
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:15,269
Travis, wait.

432
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,771
Why aren't you trying?

433
00:23:16,855 --> 00:23:20,107
Honestly? Cause
I don't give a shit.

434
00:23:20,108 --> 00:23:21,902
Well, wh... what
do you care about?

435
00:23:21,985 --> 00:23:23,570
Maybe if Erin were...

436
00:23:23,653 --> 00:23:24,988
<i>No, no, just say it! Say it!</i>

437
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:29,326
If Erin was still alive...

438
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:32,954
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have.

439
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:36,499
You know, Mom, people
die every day.

440
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:38,835
You can't change it.

441
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:40,503
And you sure as hell
can't change me.

442
00:23:53,183 --> 00:23:55,309
What's up?

443
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:57,854
<i>It's Vaughn Ely,
what's the word on my van?</i>

444
00:23:57,938 --> 00:23:59,606
Vaughn, I hate to tell you.

445
00:23:59,689 --> 00:24:01,149
It's the torque converter.

446
00:24:01,232 --> 00:24:04,027
Well, how much
is it gonna cost?

447
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,862
<i>It'll be close to 1500...</i>

448
00:24:05,946 --> 00:24:08,615
1500 dollars?

449
00:24:08,698 --> 00:24:12,827
How come anytime anything goes wrong
with the car, it's 1500 dollars?

450
00:24:12,911 --> 00:24:14,371
Now look, man,
it is what it is.

451
00:24:14,454 --> 00:24:15,830
You want me to fix it or not?

452
00:24:15,914 --> 00:24:18,375
It's gotta be
ready by Saturday.

453
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:21,878
How long on that van?

454
00:24:21,962 --> 00:24:26,216
It's gonna be at least a week.

455
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:28,593
<i>Vaughn, it's gonna be tough...</i>

456
00:24:28,677 --> 00:24:31,388
Alright, just have it done.

457
00:24:33,974 --> 00:24:35,642
Yeah.

458
00:24:35,725 --> 00:24:37,519
Yeah.

459
00:24:37,602 --> 00:24:39,813
Yeah.

460
00:24:39,896 --> 00:24:41,439
<i>You all did a great
job with the sonnets today.</i>

461
00:24:41,523 --> 00:24:44,359
We have come a long
way with Shakespeare.

462
00:24:44,442 --> 00:24:46,444
By the way, I won't
be here this afternoon...

463
00:24:46,528 --> 00:24:49,406
so if you need anything, please
check with me after class.

464
00:24:49,489 --> 00:24:50,365
Wait, where's she going?

465
00:24:50,448 --> 00:24:52,659
Basher.

466
00:24:52,742 --> 00:24:54,160
You know, her old man's
been missing for two years.

467
00:24:54,244 --> 00:24:55,412
She's gonna get a divorce.

468
00:25:01,209 --> 00:25:04,295
Hey, Travis?
Can I speak with you for a moment?

469
00:25:13,888 --> 00:25:15,765
It's about your
Macbeth exam paper.

470
00:25:15,849 --> 00:25:17,142
I thought I got an A on that.

471
00:25:17,225 --> 00:25:19,269
Actually you got a hundred.

472
00:25:19,352 --> 00:25:21,395
The highest grade in the class.

473
00:25:21,396 --> 00:25:22,981
Well, then what?

474
00:25:23,064 --> 00:25:24,733
Well, that test proves
what you can do...

475
00:25:24,816 --> 00:25:26,776
when you apply yourself.

476
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:29,612
But so far this semester
your grade is a D.

477
00:25:29,696 --> 00:25:31,614
You didn't even turn in
that book report last week.

478
00:25:31,698 --> 00:25:33,241
Guess what grade I had
to give you on that?

479
00:25:33,242 --> 00:25:34,908
<i>Hmm.</i>

480
00:25:34,909 --> 00:25:37,203
Travis, here's the deal.

481
00:25:37,287 --> 00:25:38,788
You wanna work on getting
your grade up...

482
00:25:38,872 --> 00:25:40,290
I'll help you.

483
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:42,959
But that's gotta
be your decision.

484
00:25:43,043 --> 00:25:46,046
Can I go now?

485
00:25:46,129 --> 00:25:47,756
Go ahead.

486
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:56,139
Miss Moore...

487
00:25:56,222 --> 00:25:58,933
Yes?

488
00:25:59,017 --> 00:26:03,480
I'm sorry about your husband.

489
00:26:03,563 --> 00:26:05,231
Thank you, Travis.

490
00:26:16,826 --> 00:26:19,620
♫ Go, Orange! ♫

491
00:26:19,621 --> 00:26:21,122
♫ Go, Black! ♫

492
00:26:21,206 --> 00:26:23,458
Hey, sweetie.

493
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:25,125
Hi, Vaughn.

494
00:26:25,126 --> 00:26:26,252
Sylvia.

495
00:26:26,336 --> 00:26:27,460
How nice to see you.

496
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:28,755
Enjoying the game?

497
00:26:28,838 --> 00:26:31,508
Oh, yes.
I always enjoy it.

498
00:26:36,971 --> 00:26:40,517
Down! Set!

499
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,810
Hut!

500
00:26:50,068 --> 00:26:51,945
Go, Tigers!

501
00:26:57,575 --> 00:26:59,494
Go, Tigers!

502
00:26:59,577 --> 00:27:01,495
Woo!

503
00:27:01,496 --> 00:27:03,623
You know, I think we
have our quarterback...

504
00:27:03,706 --> 00:27:05,041
for this year and the next.

505
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:06,793
That Williams kid is good.

506
00:27:06,876 --> 00:27:08,711
Yeah. He can
fire the ball.

507
00:27:08,795 --> 00:27:09,963
And he makes good decisions.

508
00:27:10,046 --> 00:27:12,006
He's smart.

509
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:13,383
Sorta like you when you won
that state title back in, uh...

510
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:16,176
Don't go there.
Too long ago.

511
00:27:16,177 --> 00:27:19,347
Yeah, listen, Vaughn, I
wanted to tell you...

512
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:22,058
I really appreciate all your
work on the Booster Club...

513
00:27:22,142 --> 00:27:25,352
especially after
you lost Rosemary.

514
00:27:25,353 --> 00:27:29,691
Yeah, my Rosemary.
She loved coming to the games.

515
00:27:29,774 --> 00:27:33,403
We're just, I mean,
I'm glad to do it.

516
00:27:33,486 --> 00:27:37,073
I tell you, it makes a big difference
when there's a lot of fans out here.

517
00:27:39,576 --> 00:27:43,746
<i>Tigers up by
seven as we head info halftime.</i>

518
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:47,709
Hey, look, there's Travis.

519
00:27:47,792 --> 00:27:50,253
Hey.

520
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:52,213
You guys are looking
good out there.

521
00:27:52,214 --> 00:27:54,883
Thanks.

522
00:27:54,966 --> 00:27:56,342
Why don't you come down?

523
00:27:56,426 --> 00:27:59,219
Er...

524
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,180
alright.

525
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:08,062
So, Travis, you don't normally
go to football games.

526
00:28:08,146 --> 00:28:09,606
Not usually.

527
00:28:09,689 --> 00:28:11,774
Is there a reason
you're at this one?

528
00:28:11,858 --> 00:28:14,611
Well, I heard there was this
really good cheer leading team.

529
00:28:14,694 --> 00:28:16,404
<i>I thought' I'd check them out.</i>

530
00:28:16,405 --> 00:28:18,531
Cute, Travis.
Real cute.

531
00:28:20,783 --> 00:28:25,078
<i>Gotta say, man,
it was a beautiful throw.</i>

532
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:26,122
You are an amazing man.

533
00:28:26,206 --> 00:28:27,707
Aw, well, thanks.

534
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:29,751
I still can't believe
we saw a ghost.

535
00:28:29,752 --> 00:28:31,628
We didn't see shit.

536
00:28:31,711 --> 00:28:34,756
No, we didn't.

537
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:36,799
What's it gonna
take to convince you?

538
00:28:36,883 --> 00:28:39,802
Okay, first of all, we gotta
make sure Ely is not home...

539
00:28:39,886 --> 00:28:42,597
and second of all,
we gotta go back.

540
00:28:47,268 --> 00:28:49,770
Okay, I've got an idea.

541
00:28:49,771 --> 00:28:51,814
He only has one car, right?

542
00:28:51,898 --> 00:28:53,816
Yeah, a funeral van.

543
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,944
Okay, so if the van's not
there, then Ely's not home.

544
00:28:55,945 --> 00:28:57,987
Dude, isn't his garage in back?

545
00:28:58,071 --> 00:29:00,490
No, he has another carport.
You can see if it's there.

546
00:29:00,573 --> 00:29:02,283
- That'll work.
- But it's a bad idea.

547
00:29:02,367 --> 00:29:03,701
No, that's a great idea.

548
00:29:03,785 --> 00:29:05,119
I mow his lawn.
He trusts me.

549
00:29:05,203 --> 00:29:07,664
We can't spy on him.

550
00:29:07,747 --> 00:29:10,750
Screw him.
Let's go.

551
00:29:14,879 --> 00:29:15,964
Alright.

552
00:29:37,485 --> 00:29:39,862
Alright, so the
van isn't there...

553
00:29:39,946 --> 00:29:41,822
which means he's not home.

554
00:29:41,823 --> 00:29:44,658
Guess what?
The show started.

555
00:29:44,659 --> 00:29:47,161
Unbelievable.

556
00:29:47,245 --> 00:29:48,495
I'll say.

557
00:29:48,496 --> 00:29:49,872
Now you're convinced?

558
00:29:49,956 --> 00:29:51,374
I am convinced
that something...

559
00:29:51,457 --> 00:29:53,459
really freakin'
weird is going on.

560
00:29:53,543 --> 00:29:54,877
Gotta be ghosts.

561
00:29:54,961 --> 00:29:56,337
<i>I wanna go see 'em.</i>

562
00:29:56,338 --> 00:29:58,047
You are seeing them.

563
00:29:58,131 --> 00:30:00,341
No, Danny, I mean I wanna
go see them up close.

564
00:30:00,425 --> 00:30:02,843
Come on.
Let's go, guys.

565
00:30:02,844 --> 00:30:04,762
Abby, are you...
are you kidding?

566
00:30:04,846 --> 00:30:07,473
Danny's right, guys.
Ely could come home at any minute.

567
00:30:07,557 --> 00:30:09,225
Are you scared, Travis?

568
00:30:09,309 --> 00:30:10,560
Brian, don't.

569
00:30:10,643 --> 00:30:12,228
No, I'm just curious.

570
00:30:12,312 --> 00:30:13,896
He's our ghost expert
yet he's pussing out.

571
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,732
I just don't think it's right.

572
00:30:15,815 --> 00:30:17,190
Oh, okay, that's cute.

573
00:30:17,191 --> 00:30:18,859
Brian! Brian,
just stop.

574
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,903
I need somebody to
stand guard anyways.

575
00:30:20,987 --> 00:30:22,822
Travis, if you see
him pull up...

576
00:30:22,905 --> 00:30:25,575
just come run and get us.

577
00:30:25,658 --> 00:30:27,076
Alright, let's go.

578
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,369
We're doing it!
Go!

579
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:30,288
Come on!

580
00:30:36,669 --> 00:30:38,838
Let's go
around the side.

581
00:30:49,349 --> 00:30:51,934
Hey, genius.
Window's open.

582
00:30:52,018 --> 00:30:56,356
What about the screen?

583
00:30:56,439 --> 00:30:58,024
I got it, I got it.

584
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:05,698
Got a criminal past that I
don't know about, Brian?

585
00:31:05,782 --> 00:31:09,202
There's a lot you do
not know about me.

586
00:31:09,285 --> 00:31:11,454
Okay, just go inside.

587
00:31:26,928 --> 00:31:28,721
What
is wrong with you?

588
00:31:28,805 --> 00:31:31,724
Danny!

589
00:31:55,706 --> 00:31:57,708
Did you hear that?

590
00:31:57,792 --> 00:31:59,836
I don't hear anything.

591
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:02,839
That's the point.
It stopped.

592
00:32:02,922 --> 00:32:05,800
Maybe we better haul ass.

593
00:32:05,883 --> 00:32:08,511
No, I wanna go upstairs.

594
00:32:08,594 --> 00:32:10,096
Yeah, come on, let's go.

595
00:32:39,375 --> 00:32:40,626
Hey, wait.

596
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,560
Danny.

597
00:32:57,643 --> 00:32:59,145
Brian!

598
00:33:55,535 --> 00:33:58,579
Oh my God.

599
00:33:58,663 --> 00:33:59,956
She's dead.

600
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:01,374
Dead?

601
00:34:01,457 --> 00:34:02,792
It's okay, it's fine.

602
00:34:02,875 --> 00:34:04,502
It's not fine!
This is crazy!

603
00:34:04,585 --> 00:34:05,878
I know it is, but
it's not my fault!

604
00:34:05,962 --> 00:34:07,171
You're freakin' crazy!

605
00:34:07,255 --> 00:34:08,297
Everyone was in on this!

606
00:34:08,381 --> 00:34:10,216
Jesus Christ!

607
00:34:10,299 --> 00:34:12,385
Vaughn.

608
00:34:12,468 --> 00:34:15,555
Come on, let's go!

609
00:34:15,638 --> 00:34:17,848
<i>What are you
doing in my house?</i>

610
00:34:21,811 --> 00:34:24,271
Uh...

611
00:34:24,272 --> 00:34:27,108
This is bad.

612
00:34:27,191 --> 00:34:29,944
It's bad.

613
00:34:30,027 --> 00:34:32,027
Get out.

614
00:34:36,993 --> 00:34:39,245
Go.

615
00:34:44,125 --> 00:34:47,295
Run, you little shits!

616
00:34:47,378 --> 00:34:49,796
Your friends left you.
Are you scared?

617
00:34:49,797 --> 00:34:52,008
Yeah.

618
00:34:52,091 --> 00:34:54,010
Travis, we gotta go!

619
00:34:54,093 --> 00:34:55,469
No, wait.
Where's Danny?

620
00:34:55,553 --> 00:34:57,304
Ely caught him!
Travis, come on!

621
00:34:57,305 --> 00:34:59,139
No! I'm not
leaving him!

622
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:02,018
Travis! Travis!

623
00:35:02,101 --> 00:35:04,270
<i>Please, stop!</i>

624
00:35:04,353 --> 00:35:07,147
Mr. Ely, please.
Just let him go, please.

625
00:35:07,148 --> 00:35:08,691
He didn't mean any harm.

626
00:35:08,774 --> 00:35:10,318
You want
me to let him go?

627
00:35:10,319 --> 00:35:13,486
Please.

628
00:35:13,487 --> 00:35:16,032
Say please.

629
00:35:16,115 --> 00:35:17,991
Please let me go.

630
00:35:17,992 --> 00:35:19,827
Please let me go.

631
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:21,161
Okay.

632
00:35:27,877 --> 00:35:36,218
Stairs can be very dangerous.

633
00:35:36,302 --> 00:35:39,513
Most accidents
happen in the home.

634
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:46,853
There, you little shit!
Is that clear enough for you?

635
00:35:46,854 --> 00:35:48,439
What's going on?

636
00:35:48,522 --> 00:35:49,523
<i>Come on. Let's go.</i>

637
00:35:49,607 --> 00:35:51,067
Where's Danny?

638
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:52,902
Let's go! Come on!
Let's go! Run!

639
00:35:54,403 --> 00:35:55,780
<i>Where's Danny?</i>

640
00:35:57,531 --> 00:35:59,200
<i>9-1-1. State
your emergency.</i>

641
00:35:59,201 --> 00:36:01,327
This is Vaughn Ely.

642
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:04,580
I need an ambulance and
the police right away.

643
00:36:04,664 --> 00:36:08,084
There's... been
a terrible accident.

644
00:36:08,167 --> 00:36:10,544
I'll wait for them outside.

645
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:17,551
Come on, sweetheart.
Let's go.

646
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:38,698
Now in a minute I'm gonna
let your folks in.

647
00:36:38,781 --> 00:36:40,783
You're gonna be released
to their custody.

648
00:36:40,866 --> 00:36:43,244
Wait, so we're
not going to jail.

649
00:36:43,327 --> 00:36:45,371
Well, you'll have to go before
a judge in the morning.

650
00:36:45,454 --> 00:36:47,456
A lot depends
on Mr. Ely.

651
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,959
He's the one who should
be going to jail.

652
00:36:50,042 --> 00:36:51,751
Yeah, we have
been through this.

653
00:36:51,752 --> 00:36:53,587
Why don't you believe us?

654
00:36:53,671 --> 00:36:55,255
Brian and I
both saw that thing.

655
00:36:55,256 --> 00:36:57,633
Young lady, we
searched that house.

656
00:36:57,717 --> 00:36:59,301
There was no dead body.

657
00:36:59,385 --> 00:37:00,970
But we saw it and it was there.

658
00:37:01,053 --> 00:37:02,179
It was up there on the bed.

659
00:37:02,263 --> 00:37:03,681
Alright, kids, listen...

660
00:37:03,764 --> 00:37:05,182
What about what
happened to Danny?

661
00:37:05,266 --> 00:37:06,726
Why don't you
arrest Ely for that?

662
00:37:06,809 --> 00:37:08,394
<i>You have Travis as a witness.</i>

663
00:37:08,477 --> 00:37:10,479
In our investigation,
we determined...

664
00:37:10,563 --> 00:37:12,565
that Danny fell
down those stairs.

665
00:37:12,648 --> 00:37:14,400
He did not fall
down the stairs, okay?

666
00:37:14,483 --> 00:37:15,985
Ely pushed him and then
he stomped on his head.

667
00:37:16,068 --> 00:37:17,403
Alright, listen.

668
00:37:17,486 --> 00:37:18,988
Travis, I know you're scared.

669
00:37:19,071 --> 00:37:20,573
But lying's gonna make it worse.

670
00:37:20,656 --> 00:37:22,491
Well, I'm not lying.

671
00:37:22,575 --> 00:37:25,077
And I'm not scared.

672
00:37:27,747 --> 00:37:30,583
Come in.

673
00:37:30,666 --> 00:37:32,001
Sarge, here it is.

674
00:37:32,084 --> 00:37:35,129
Thank you.

675
00:37:35,212 --> 00:37:37,757
All right, these are the
pictures we took in the bedroom.

676
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,675
You see a mannequin.
The closet door open...

677
00:37:39,759 --> 00:37:40,801
and some sewing stuff in there.

678
00:37:40,885 --> 00:37:42,094
That's not it.

679
00:37:42,178 --> 00:37:43,721
That's not what we saw.

680
00:37:43,804 --> 00:37:45,097
And you were nosing around...

681
00:37:45,181 --> 00:37:46,682
you opened the closet door...

682
00:37:46,766 --> 00:37:47,767
We didn't touch the door!

683
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:49,016
This is bullshit!

684
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:49,977
Watch your language.

685
00:37:51,103 --> 00:37:55,274
What?

686
00:37:55,357 --> 00:37:57,485
Sargeant, that
was the hospital.

687
00:38:03,365 --> 00:38:04,325
What?

688
00:38:06,827 --> 00:38:09,705
I'm afraid your friend is dead.

689
00:38:19,965 --> 00:38:23,219
These kids, when they do things,
they don't realize the consequences.

690
00:38:23,302 --> 00:38:26,012
Phil, I... I know
what goes on.

691
00:38:26,013 --> 00:38:28,057
Kids make up stories
about morticians.

692
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,559
I work with dead bodies.

693
00:38:30,643 --> 00:38:32,978
It's all a big joke, until
somebody gets hurt.

694
00:38:33,062 --> 00:38:35,314
I'm sure sad it had to happen.

695
00:38:35,397 --> 00:38:38,526
It's tragic for everybody.

696
00:38:38,609 --> 00:38:40,569
That boy's family...

697
00:38:40,653 --> 00:38:42,905
I can't imagine what
they're going through.

698
00:38:42,988 --> 00:38:43,948
Mm.

699
00:38:44,031 --> 00:38:45,407
It's beyond me.

700
00:38:45,491 --> 00:38:47,743
Vaughn, like I said...

701
00:38:47,827 --> 00:38:51,997
you don't need to come on down there
if you're not pressing any charges.

702
00:38:52,081 --> 00:38:55,918
Everybody's suffered enough.

703
00:38:56,001 --> 00:38:58,045
You're a good man, Vaughn.

704
00:39:42,131 --> 00:39:44,717
Honey-bunny.

705
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,640
There you are.

706
00:39:54,101 --> 00:39:55,811
See, Rose?

707
00:39:55,895 --> 00:40:01,901
I told you they wouldn't
find you up here, huh?

708
00:40:01,984 --> 00:40:04,111
No. No, honey.

709
00:40:04,194 --> 00:40:06,822
We have to stay here
a few more days.

710
00:40:06,906 --> 00:40:09,742
Just in case.
Safety first.

711
00:40:09,825 --> 00:40:13,162
All right?  Hm?

712
00:40:13,245 --> 00:40:17,249
And then we're gonna
party like rock stars.

713
00:40:19,919 --> 00:40:21,211
Nighty night.

714
00:40:24,548 --> 00:40:26,342
<i>I'd like to
talk for a second.</i>

715
00:40:26,425 --> 00:40:28,260
There's nothing
to talk about, Mom.

716
00:40:28,344 --> 00:40:30,346
Police don't believe me,
you don't believe me, so...

717
00:40:30,429 --> 00:40:32,014
tell me, what do you
want to talk about?

718
00:40:32,097 --> 00:40:34,307
I believe you.

719
00:40:34,308 --> 00:40:35,893
Oh, bullshit.

720
00:40:35,976 --> 00:40:37,978
No, this is the same
like when Erin died.

721
00:40:38,062 --> 00:40:39,813
What?

722
00:40:39,897 --> 00:40:41,982
You don't believe Ely broke
Danny's neck, do you?

723
00:40:42,066 --> 00:40:46,528
Okay? For once in your life, tell
me the fucking truth! Please!

724
00:40:46,612 --> 00:40:48,322
I love you so much.

725
00:40:48,405 --> 00:40:52,868
I couldn't bear for
something to happen to you.

726
00:40:52,952 --> 00:40:56,663
Please promise you'll never
go near Vaughn Ely again.

727
00:40:56,664 --> 00:40:58,791
And you know why I want
you to promise me?

728
00:40:58,874 --> 00:41:00,500
No.

729
00:41:00,501 --> 00:41:03,336
Because I'm afraid.

730
00:41:03,337 --> 00:41:07,883
I'm afraid what that
man may do to you.

731
00:41:07,967 --> 00:41:12,845
Now does that sound
like the truth?

732
00:41:12,846 --> 00:41:14,890
Sorry I yelled.

733
00:41:14,974 --> 00:41:18,852
So you promise me?

734
00:41:18,936 --> 00:41:21,146
Danny was my best friend.

735
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:25,025
Oh, Travis.
I know, honey.

736
00:41:25,109 --> 00:41:27,027
We all loved him.

737
00:41:27,111 --> 00:41:33,325
But please promise me.

738
00:41:33,409 --> 00:41:34,785
I promise.

739
00:41:46,213 --> 00:41:48,924
I do believe...

740
00:41:49,008 --> 00:41:51,719
we have you looking better...

741
00:41:51,802 --> 00:41:54,847
than when you broke
into my house.

742
00:42:44,271 --> 00:42:48,067
May there be abundant
peace from heaven...

743
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:52,988
and light upon us
and upon all Israel.

744
00:42:53,072 --> 00:42:55,574
And say Amen.

745
00:43:07,252 --> 00:43:09,254
May God comfort you...

746
00:43:09,338 --> 00:43:13,258
along with the mourners
of Zion, Jerusalem.

747
00:43:19,681 --> 00:43:22,851
<i>Travis, I'm so sorry.</i>

748
00:43:22,935 --> 00:43:24,269
Thanks.

749
00:43:36,615 --> 00:43:38,534
Did you get a chance to
talk to Danny's parents?

750
00:43:38,617 --> 00:43:41,036
I went over there yesterday
and talked to them.

751
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:43,830
Have you guys noticed the way
everyone was staring at us?

752
00:43:43,831 --> 00:43:45,832
It's like it's our fault.

753
00:43:45,833 --> 00:43:47,459
They know how
much we loved him.

754
00:43:47,543 --> 00:43:49,419
Yeah, well,
it's pissin' me off.

755
00:43:49,503 --> 00:43:51,670
I mean, I know we weren't
supposed to be there, but...

756
00:43:51,671 --> 00:43:53,048
we had some fun
and then this accident...

757
00:43:53,132 --> 00:43:54,466
Accident?

758
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:55,884
Whatever.

759
00:43:55,968 --> 00:43:57,386
No, I told you what happened.

760
00:43:57,469 --> 00:43:58,679
He killed Danny.
I told you.

761
00:43:58,762 --> 00:44:00,513
Will you GUYS just stop.

762
00:44:00,514 --> 00:44:02,641
Nothing's ever
your fault, is it?

763
00:44:02,724 --> 00:44:05,227
I mean, it's always
somebody else's.

764
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:06,812
I mean, don't you
think we're all...

765
00:44:06,895 --> 00:44:08,272
partially to blame
for Danny's death?

766
00:44:08,355 --> 00:44:09,523
To blame, yeah, okay, we...

767
00:44:09,606 --> 00:44:10,899
No, no, we did enough.

768
00:44:10,983 --> 00:44:13,235
We never should've gone in.

769
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:15,362
I thought this
would be different.

770
00:44:15,445 --> 00:44:18,907
I really did.
That maybe I could count on you.

771
00:44:18,991 --> 00:44:20,159
Yeah? For what?

772
00:44:20,242 --> 00:44:22,035
What do you think?

773
00:44:22,119 --> 00:44:23,954
Help me prove he killed Danny.

774
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,716
I didn't kill anyone.

775
00:44:36,717 --> 00:44:41,220
And I don't appreciate you spreading
gossip and rumors about me...

776
00:44:41,221 --> 00:44:43,140
to make yourself look good.

777
00:44:43,223 --> 00:44:47,269
Oh, yeah? What the hell do
you think you're doing here?

778
00:44:47,352 --> 00:44:50,439
It's my job.

779
00:44:50,522 --> 00:44:54,233
I'm still on the clock.

780
00:44:54,234 --> 00:44:56,069
We know what you did, Ely.

781
00:44:56,153 --> 00:45:00,324
Abby? Careful.

782
00:45:01,867 --> 00:45:04,243
Man, that guy creeps me out.

783
00:45:04,244 --> 00:45:08,081
The guy's more
than just a creep.

784
00:45:08,165 --> 00:45:11,960
Travis.

785
00:45:12,044 --> 00:45:13,879
You can count on me.

786
00:45:32,898 --> 00:45:34,983
Mr. Harwood.

787
00:45:35,067 --> 00:45:36,860
Travis, she's grounded.

788
00:45:36,944 --> 00:45:39,445
I'm just wondering if I
could maybe talk to her.

789
00:45:39,446 --> 00:45:41,365
Travis, it's late.

790
00:45:41,448 --> 00:45:44,159
I think she still has some
homework she needs to finish.

791
00:45:44,243 --> 00:45:49,164
<i>Dad, I finished
all my home work.</i>

792
00:45:49,248 --> 00:45:53,752
We'll just be on the porch.

793
00:45:53,835 --> 00:45:57,089
Alright. For
a little while.

794
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:05,764
Well, I'm not your
dad's favorite person.

795
00:46:05,847 --> 00:46:10,686
I'll bet your mom's not
terribly fond of me.

796
00:46:10,769 --> 00:46:13,647
Well, Abby, um...

797
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:18,193
I know. We broke
into the house.

798
00:46:18,277 --> 00:46:23,365
We didn't do anything
to cause Danny's death.

799
00:46:23,448 --> 00:46:27,786
We shouldn't feel guilty
for what Ely did to him.

800
00:46:27,869 --> 00:46:30,998
It's not our fault.

801
00:46:31,081 --> 00:46:34,000
You're right.

802
00:46:34,001 --> 00:46:35,669
It's not your fault.

803
00:46:35,752 --> 00:46:39,047
But it's different for me
because I was there.

804
00:46:39,131 --> 00:46:43,510
I saw it.

805
00:46:43,593 --> 00:46:47,513
And I didn't do a
damn thing about it.

806
00:46:47,514 --> 00:46:49,224
Just like Erin.

807
00:46:52,019 --> 00:46:53,729
I mean, if I'd
done something...

808
00:46:53,812 --> 00:46:56,481
You went in there.

809
00:46:56,565 --> 00:46:58,025
You tried to help Danny.

810
00:46:58,108 --> 00:47:01,528
And he's dead.

811
00:47:01,611 --> 00:47:05,324
Travis, did
you have any idea...

812
00:47:05,407 --> 00:47:06,825
<i>what Ely would do
when he re-ache-d..</i>

813
00:47:06,908 --> 00:47:09,201
<i>The bottom of the stairs?</i>

814
00:47:09,202 --> 00:47:10,871
What do you mean?

815
00:47:10,954 --> 00:47:13,415
Did you know he was gonna
break Danny's neck?

816
00:47:13,498 --> 00:47:15,541
Well, I mean,
it happened so fast.

817
00:47:15,542 --> 00:47:20,922
See? That's
what I'm saying.

818
00:47:21,006 --> 00:47:27,596
You didn't have
a chance to react.

819
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:35,854
The guts to go in
when nobody else did.

820
00:47:35,937 --> 00:47:37,522
And I'm proud of you for that.

821
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:53,121
Thank you.

822
00:47:56,708 --> 00:48:00,253
Abby. It's
getting late.

823
00:48:00,337 --> 00:48:02,631
<i>Good night, Travis.</i>

824
00:48:27,614 --> 00:48:31,743
<i>Pile just
keeps growing.</i>

825
00:48:31,827 --> 00:48:37,749
Looks like
everybody brought something.

826
00:48:37,833 --> 00:48:39,418
It's not gonna bring him back.

827
00:48:51,263 --> 00:48:54,140
Abby, they all believe Ely.

828
00:48:54,141 --> 00:48:56,226
But if we can prove
he's crazy or...

829
00:48:56,309 --> 00:48:59,146
He's a total psychopath, and
we're the only ones who know it.

830
00:48:59,229 --> 00:49:01,314
What if we had
a photo of that body?

831
00:49:01,398 --> 00:49:03,650
Then they'd have to believe
us or at least ask questions.

832
00:49:03,651 --> 00:49:05,986
She's definitely
not a mannequin.

833
00:49:06,069 --> 00:49:07,571
But where is she?

834
00:49:07,654 --> 00:49:09,114
I bet she's
back in the bedroom.

835
00:49:09,197 --> 00:49:10,699
Why would he put her back?

836
00:49:10,782 --> 00:49:12,825
Who knows?
He's weirder than shit.

837
00:49:12,826 --> 00:49:18,206
For some reason, he likes
her in that bedroom.

838
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:22,461
I'm going in tonight.

839
00:49:22,544 --> 00:49:24,171
You're not going in without me.

840
00:49:24,254 --> 00:49:25,547
Yeah, I am.

841
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:27,299
Travis, don't be all macho...

842
00:49:27,382 --> 00:49:29,176
and try to tell me what
I can and can't do.

843
00:49:29,259 --> 00:49:30,469
I know you want to help but
it's not gonna happen.

844
00:49:30,552 --> 00:49:31,720
I'm not...

845
00:49:31,803 --> 00:49:38,018
Travis! Just
shut up.

846
00:49:38,101 --> 00:49:41,396
Okay.

847
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:43,732
Compromise.

848
00:49:43,815 --> 00:49:47,694
You can be my lookout.

849
00:50:23,146 --> 00:50:25,106
Okay, we've been here
over an hour, Travis.

850
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:26,898
I don't think he's going
anywhere tonight.

851
00:50:26,899 --> 00:50:27,943
Give it a few more minutes.

852
00:50:29,611 --> 00:50:30,904
How'd you get
out of your house?

853
00:50:30,987 --> 00:50:32,656
I told my mom I'm at Karen's.

854
00:50:32,739 --> 00:50:35,074
She's having this like
slumber party thing.

855
00:50:35,075 --> 00:50:36,618
I thought you were grounded.

856
00:50:36,701 --> 00:50:38,537
I am but I convinced
her to let me out.

857
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:41,289
I'm kind of on parole.

858
00:50:41,373 --> 00:50:43,248
Anyway, I left
my phone at Karen's.

859
00:50:43,249 --> 00:50:44,876
So I told her that
if anybody calls...

860
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,628
just to tell them
I'm in the shower.

861
00:50:55,887 --> 00:50:57,138
<i>Look.</i>

862
00:51:21,496 --> 00:51:22,956
I guess now's our chance.

863
00:51:22,957 --> 00:51:23,957
Yeah.
Come on.

864
00:51:28,169 --> 00:51:30,171
No, you can't do that.
It's padlocked, come on.

865
00:51:30,255 --> 00:51:32,257
Let's go.

866
00:51:39,973 --> 00:51:41,933
Come on.
You can do it.

867
00:51:45,478 --> 00:51:46,938
<i>Can you make it
over the fence...</i>

868
00:51:47,022 --> 00:51:48,356
<i>if we have to get out fast?</i>

869
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:49,858
<i>Yeah. I can.</i>

870
00:51:49,941 --> 00:51:53,486
This house is so creepy.

871
00:51:53,570 --> 00:51:55,238
No shit.

872
00:51:55,322 --> 00:51:56,865
We just need to get in
and get out before...

873
00:51:58,408 --> 00:51:59,451
You okay?

874
00:51:59,534 --> 00:52:00,785
What was that?

875
00:52:00,869 --> 00:52:02,454
I don't know.

876
00:52:05,290 --> 00:52:06,499
You're kidding me.

877
00:52:12,505 --> 00:52:15,717
<i>You know, I'll bet...</i>

878
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,010
<i>Travis...</i>

879
00:52:25,769 --> 00:52:28,897
Alright, come on.

880
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:30,440
Oh, God.

881
00:52:33,985 --> 00:52:35,487
Remember,
stick to the plan.

882
00:52:35,570 --> 00:52:39,074
Get in and get out
and take a picture.

883
00:52:39,157 --> 00:52:40,659
Look, just stay here, okay?

884
00:52:40,742 --> 00:52:42,619
If you see anything
or hear anything...

885
00:52:42,702 --> 00:52:44,037
you get out. Don't wait for me.

886
00:52:44,038 --> 00:52:47,415
What if we get separated?

887
00:52:47,499 --> 00:52:49,167
<i>I'll find you.</i>

888
00:53:05,642 --> 00:53:06,685
Thanks for being you.

889
00:53:06,768 --> 00:53:09,270
Just hurry, Travis.

890
00:54:32,103 --> 00:54:33,897
Come on, Travis.

891
00:54:42,363 --> 00:54:44,282
<i>Damn it.</i>

892
00:55:08,056 --> 00:55:09,307
Yoo-hoo.

893
00:55:11,726 --> 00:55:13,144
Where is she?

894
00:55:13,228 --> 00:55:14,853
Well, that depends.

895
00:55:14,854 --> 00:55:16,898
If you're talking
about Rosemary...

896
00:55:16,981 --> 00:55:18,650
don't worry about her.
She's safe.

897
00:55:18,733 --> 00:55:21,193
<i>But if you're
talking about Abby.</i>

898
00:55:21,194 --> 00:55:23,530
Uh, I don't know.

899
00:55:23,613 --> 00:55:25,490
What did you do to her? Tell me!

900
00:55:25,573 --> 00:55:29,494
Travis, you're in no position
to be making demands.

901
00:55:29,577 --> 00:55:33,414
You are a burglar...
and this is Texas.

902
00:55:33,498 --> 00:55:37,209
And in Texas, we
can shoot burglars.

903
00:55:37,210 --> 00:55:41,714
You killed my best friend.

904
00:55:41,798 --> 00:55:43,258
You're fucking crazy.

905
00:55:46,469 --> 00:55:48,346
Are you scared now?

906
00:55:48,429 --> 00:55:49,347
No!

907
00:55:56,813 --> 00:55:58,690
Abby!
Abby!

908
00:56:33,766 --> 00:56:35,268
Shit.

909
00:56:51,492 --> 00:56:53,453
I chased him
out through here...

910
00:56:53,536 --> 00:56:55,997
and I took a shot at him as
he was going over the fence.

911
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:57,165
Is that his flashlight?

912
00:56:57,248 --> 00:56:58,750
<i>No, that's mine</i>

913
00:56:58,833 --> 00:57:00,335
I dropped it when I... Thank you.

914
00:57:00,418 --> 00:57:01,628
Came out.

915
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:09,344
Don't worry, Vaughn. We'll find him.
He won't get far.

916
00:57:18,186 --> 00:57:19,646
You were a great wide receiver.

917
00:57:19,729 --> 00:57:21,189
You caught everything
I threw to you.

918
00:57:21,272 --> 00:57:22,523
Yeah, well man,
we were a good pair.

919
00:57:22,607 --> 00:57:23,858
Yeah.

920
00:57:23,942 --> 00:57:25,985
Broke a lot of records.

921
00:57:26,069 --> 00:57:28,279
So you took one more shot...

922
00:57:28,363 --> 00:57:33,325
as he ran for the fence.

923
00:57:33,326 --> 00:57:37,162
Yeah, I probably shouldn't
have done that.

924
00:57:37,163 --> 00:57:39,958
I mean, that was
twice in one week.

925
00:57:40,041 --> 00:57:41,876
Yeah, yeah.

926
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:43,711
<i>Shooting them in the
house is one thing...</i>

927
00:57:43,795 --> 00:57:45,213
but you don't shoot a
burglar in the back.

928
00:57:45,296 --> 00:57:47,507
Especially outside.

929
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:49,384
<i>You're lucky you didn't
hit the neighbors.</i>

930
00:57:49,467 --> 00:57:51,719
I was upset.

931
00:57:51,803 --> 00:57:53,471
I was scared, really.

932
00:57:58,643 --> 00:58:00,478
It's enough to
get you frazzled.

933
00:58:08,027 --> 00:58:10,363
Hey, Vaughn...

934
00:58:10,446 --> 00:58:12,740
what are you doing
with this tarp?

935
00:58:12,824 --> 00:58:16,368
I'm putting in a tomato patch.

936
00:58:16,369 --> 00:58:19,205
It helps, uh, kill the grass.

937
00:58:19,288 --> 00:58:22,041
<i>Tomato patch, hm.</i>

938
00:58:22,125 --> 00:58:27,755
You're going green.

939
00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:31,217
Hm.

940
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:34,386
Let me ask you something.

941
00:58:34,387 --> 00:58:36,888
Does this work pretty quickly?

942
00:58:36,889 --> 00:58:41,227
Yeah. You just
spread out the tarp...

943
00:58:41,310 --> 00:58:44,772
and in a couple of days,
everything's dead.

944
00:59:06,419 --> 00:59:11,966
I'm definitely gonna have
to get me one of these.

945
00:59:18,848 --> 00:59:21,767
You wanna see where
he went over the fence?

946
00:59:21,768 --> 00:59:23,895
Uh, yeah.
Yeah.

947
01:00:09,982 --> 01:00:10,983
No!

948
01:00:11,067 --> 01:00:14,153
<i>No, no, no!</i>

949
01:00:22,328 --> 01:00:26,541
In my haste, I forgot
to lock the box.

950
01:00:26,624 --> 01:00:29,544
Totally my fault.

951
01:00:29,627 --> 01:00:33,214
Gets dark in there, doesn't it?

952
01:00:33,297 --> 01:00:35,216
You want a night light?

953
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:39,345
Here.
Take it.

954
01:00:39,428 --> 01:00:42,014
Don't be rude.
Take it.

955
01:00:44,809 --> 01:00:46,519
See you later.

956
01:00:58,614 --> 01:01:00,575
<i>Open!</i>

957
01:01:16,632 --> 01:01:18,384
What happened to you, son?

958
01:01:18,467 --> 01:01:21,762
I fell on one of those...

959
01:01:21,846 --> 01:01:25,224
those things that stick out of the
cement that are really sharp on...

960
01:01:25,308 --> 01:01:26,392
Rebar.

961
01:01:26,475 --> 01:01:28,227
Rebar?

962
01:01:28,311 --> 01:01:30,897
Yeah, those steel rods,
they call them rebar.

963
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:33,065
Oh. Yeah.

964
01:01:33,149 --> 01:01:36,736
Travis, this is
a local anesthetic.

965
01:01:36,819 --> 01:01:39,113
I need to get you numb
so I can close the wound.

966
01:01:45,661 --> 01:01:47,288
Don't worry.

967
01:01:47,371 --> 01:01:49,874
You won't feel a thing
when he sews you up.

968
01:01:52,001 --> 01:01:55,254
<i>Dr. Walker...</i>

969
01:01:55,338 --> 01:01:57,715
<i>It's not you
fault, you know.</i>

970
01:01:59,342 --> 01:02:01,093
What did you say?

971
01:02:01,177 --> 01:02:03,095
I said
it's not your fault.

972
01:02:03,179 --> 01:02:06,140
They leave rebar sticking
up all over the place.

973
01:02:18,527 --> 01:02:20,947
<i>Travis, are you all right?</i>

974
01:02:22,907 --> 01:02:25,993
<i>It's not your fault,
Travis.</i>

975
01:02:26,077 --> 01:02:28,537
<i>It's her time.</i>

976
01:02:32,083 --> 01:02:34,794
Well, it's not Abby's time.

977
01:02:34,877 --> 01:02:38,172
What's that?
Are you okay?

978
01:02:38,256 --> 01:02:41,634
It wasn't the minister
talking to my mother.

979
01:02:41,717 --> 01:02:43,803
He was trying to tell me.

980
01:02:47,265 --> 01:02:51,310
Travis, when your mother gets here,
you're gonna tell her the truth.

981
01:02:51,394 --> 01:02:54,355
I know a gunshot
wound when I see one.

982
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:58,818
<i>That lie you told...</i>

983
01:02:58,901 --> 01:03:01,112
don't you feel a little guilty?

984
01:03:04,115 --> 01:03:05,783
I used to.

985
01:03:10,413 --> 01:03:13,207
Okay.
Well, I will be right back.

986
01:03:13,291 --> 01:03:15,501
Uh, actually, can I
borrow your phone?

987
01:03:15,584 --> 01:03:16,836
Yeah, sure.

988
01:03:16,919 --> 01:03:18,421
Thank you.

989
01:03:19,755 --> 01:03:20,840
Thanks.

990
01:03:26,929 --> 01:03:28,055
Brian.

991
01:03:28,139 --> 01:03:30,391
<i>Wassup?</i>

992
01:03:30,474 --> 01:03:32,685
Look!

993
01:03:32,768 --> 01:03:35,062
I could really use
your help right now.

994
01:03:35,146 --> 01:03:37,732
Abby's in trouble.

995
01:03:43,112 --> 01:03:44,697
Thank God you weren't killed.

996
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:46,866
Mom.

997
01:03:46,949 --> 01:03:49,869
Travis, listen to me.
You don't realize how serious this is.

998
01:03:49,952 --> 01:03:52,204
Yes. I do.

999
01:03:52,288 --> 01:03:56,208
Even if you don't believe me, you
have to tell them Ely has Abby.

1000
01:03:56,292 --> 01:03:57,710
Travis, what are you gonna do?

1001
01:03:57,793 --> 01:03:59,879
She may still be alive.

1002
01:03:59,962 --> 01:04:01,881
If I'm gonna save her,
I need to go now.

1003
01:04:01,964 --> 01:04:03,924
God.

1004
01:04:04,008 --> 01:04:07,178
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Not so fast, Travis. Not so fast.

1005
01:04:08,971 --> 01:04:11,015
Don't let him out
of your sight.

1006
01:04:15,144 --> 01:04:18,606
Miss Penny, they're
gonna keep him overnight.

1007
01:04:18,689 --> 01:04:21,567
<i>The doctor's like to check
him out in the morning.</i>

1008
01:04:21,650 --> 01:04:24,779
The DA is gonna charge
him with burglary.

1009
01:04:24,862 --> 01:04:28,783
Later on they may certify
him as an adult.

1010
01:04:28,866 --> 01:04:30,576
Oh, dear God.

1011
01:04:30,659 --> 01:04:33,454
Be a good idea
to get a good lawyer.

1012
01:04:33,537 --> 01:04:37,917
What about what Travis said
about the Harwood girl?

1013
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:41,128
Yeah, don't you worry.
I'm gonna check that out personally.

1014
01:04:41,212 --> 01:04:42,963
Thank you.

1015
01:04:45,383 --> 01:04:46,759
Phil?

1016
01:04:46,842 --> 01:04:49,762
Hey, Russell.
Ls-is Elaine in?

1017
01:04:49,845 --> 01:04:52,598
Yes. Elaine?

1018
01:04:52,681 --> 01:04:54,433
Has there been an accident?

1019
01:04:54,517 --> 01:04:56,435
Oh, no, no.
There's not an accident.

1020
01:04:56,519 --> 01:04:58,938
There's just a boy.
A juvenile got arrested tonight...

1021
01:04:59,021 --> 01:05:00,940
and he said that
Abby was with him.

1022
01:05:01,023 --> 01:05:03,275
I don't put much stock
in what this kid says...

1023
01:05:03,359 --> 01:05:06,779
but I need to make
sure that Abby's safe.

1024
01:05:06,862 --> 01:05:09,782
Yes, she's at her friend's
spending the night.

1025
01:05:09,865 --> 01:05:12,618
I'll call and make sure
she's over there. Okay?

1026
01:05:12,701 --> 01:05:14,787
Thank you.

1027
01:05:14,870 --> 01:05:16,664
Sorry to disturb you so late.

1028
01:05:16,747 --> 01:05:20,000
<i>Hi. This is Abby's mom. Is she...</i>

1029
01:05:20,084 --> 01:05:21,961
<i>No, no, no, that's okay...</i>

1030
01:05:22,044 --> 01:05:23,629
<i>Don't get her
out of the shower.</i>

1031
01:05:23,712 --> 01:05:25,798
<i>Okay. Yeah.</i>

1032
01:05:25,881 --> 01:05:28,968
She's there. I... everything's fine.
I talked to her friend.

1033
01:05:29,051 --> 01:05:32,346
Good, good. You know, like I said, I
didn't think there was much to it.

1034
01:05:32,430 --> 01:05:34,140
So, y'all have a nice evening.

1035
01:05:34,223 --> 01:05:35,349
You, too.

1036
01:05:35,433 --> 01:05:36,892
Thank you.

1037
01:05:43,232 --> 01:05:45,151
Officer Alvarez. Hey.

1038
01:05:45,234 --> 01:05:48,320
Brian. I know he's your
friend but you can't go in.

1039
01:05:48,404 --> 01:05:49,989
I just wanted
to see how he's doing.

1040
01:05:50,072 --> 01:05:51,490
He's okay.

1041
01:05:51,574 --> 01:05:53,492
Yeah? Did you see him?

1042
01:05:53,576 --> 01:05:55,870
Yeah, the wound is on the side.
It's not bad at all.

1043
01:05:58,122 --> 01:06:01,333
Hey, uh, did you hear we're...
we're undefeated this year?

1044
01:06:01,417 --> 01:06:03,669
Yeah. Angie
told me that.

1045
01:06:03,752 --> 01:06:06,005
Yeah. You know,
she's at every game.

1046
01:06:06,088 --> 01:06:08,841
She told me you've thrown a
touchdown in every game.

1047
01:06:08,924 --> 01:06:11,844
I don't know how I
do it, but yeah.

1048
01:06:11,927 --> 01:06:14,346
Well, tell Angie
I said hey, okay?

1049
01:06:14,430 --> 01:06:17,016
<i>Sure- I'll tell him.</i>

1050
01:06:17,099 --> 01:06:19,351
You know, I know
it's a lot to ask...

1051
01:06:19,435 --> 01:06:22,229
but is there any way that I can go
in there for like half a second?

1052
01:06:22,313 --> 01:06:24,690
Absolutely not, Brian. Positive.

1053
01:06:24,773 --> 01:06:26,525
You're right.
I'm sorry.

1054
01:06:26,609 --> 01:06:27,985
Have a good one.

1055
01:06:31,655 --> 01:06:33,157
Brian.

1056
01:06:37,953 --> 01:06:39,205
You have one minute.

1057
01:06:39,288 --> 01:06:40,498
Thanks.

1058
01:06:43,250 --> 01:06:45,544
- Hi. So what happened?
- Ely got her.

1059
01:06:45,628 --> 01:06:47,546
- Are you shitting me?
- No one believes me.

1060
01:06:47,630 --> 01:06:49,548
It's gonna be morning till
they find out she's missing.

1061
01:06:49,632 --> 01:06:51,884
Great. So, we gotta
bust out of here.

1062
01:06:51,967 --> 01:06:53,552
Got any ideas to get past him?

1063
01:06:53,636 --> 01:06:55,179
Yeah, I got a couple.

1064
01:06:56,805 --> 01:06:59,725
Travis, look, what
you said about me...

1065
01:06:59,808 --> 01:07:01,727
No, no, you were right.

1066
01:07:01,810 --> 01:07:04,897
I pushed everyone to go in
there and I screwed up.

1067
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:06,899
No.

1068
01:07:06,982 --> 01:07:08,651
We screwed up.

1069
01:07:11,654 --> 01:07:13,739
Hey there.

1070
01:07:13,822 --> 01:07:16,283
He says it's starting to hurt.

1071
01:07:16,367 --> 01:07:20,246
I guess they numbed it when they stitched
him up, but I think it's wearing off.

1072
01:07:20,329 --> 01:07:22,081
Could be, yeah.

1073
01:07:22,164 --> 01:07:24,416
<i>You think the nurse'll
give him something?</i>

1074
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:26,252
<i>I bet they already have.</i>

1075
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:28,754
Yeah, that's right.
It's down here, right?

1076
01:07:28,837 --> 01:07:30,714
<i>Dammit, kid.</i>

1077
01:07:34,843 --> 01:07:36,887
Three-oh-four in dispatch.
I got a run.

1078
01:07:40,182 --> 01:07:41,809
<i>He got to
the stairs before...</i>

1079
01:07:41,892 --> 01:07:43,769
<i>- I could grab him
- What?</i>

1080
01:07:43,852 --> 01:07:45,771
<i>He got' to the stairs
before I could grab him.</i>

1081
01:07:45,854 --> 01:07:47,273
Who, Alvarez?

1082
01:07:47,356 --> 01:07:50,651
<i>Travis.
I'm sorry, Sarge.</i>

1083
01:07:50,734 --> 01:07:54,446
We're a couple blocks away.
We'll cut him off and we'll come around the back.

1084
01:08:13,757 --> 01:08:16,510
All right, Jesse, check it out.

1085
01:08:28,230 --> 01:08:31,024
Travis.
Travis!

1086
01:08:31,025 --> 01:08:32,026
<i>Travis, you come here.</i>

1087
01:08:35,571 --> 01:08:36,739
Get in!

1088
01:08:40,951 --> 01:08:42,661
He's going left.
He's going left.

1089
01:08:42,745 --> 01:08:44,955
<i>I'll take it around
the block. I got it.</i>

1090
01:09:05,934 --> 01:09:07,561
The game's over, Travis.

1091
01:09:07,645 --> 01:09:09,855
<i>Don't move, kid.
You hear me?</i>

1092
01:09:09,938 --> 01:09:11,690
<i>Yeah, I hear you.</i>

1093
01:09:11,774 --> 01:09:13,484
<i>Woo, you guys totally
saved my butt.</i>

1094
01:09:14,943 --> 01:09:16,195
<i>Damn.</i>

1095
01:09:16,278 --> 01:09:17,529
Son of a bitch.

1096
01:09:17,613 --> 01:09:20,407
<i>Dammit, Brian.</i>

1097
01:09:20,491 --> 01:09:22,868
Ls Charlie working
the parade tonight?

1098
01:09:22,951 --> 01:09:25,871
Get on the horn. Tell him to look for
a kid who has a bloody T-shirt on.

1099
01:09:25,954 --> 01:09:28,248
All right, Brian.
What were you and Travis up to?

1100
01:09:28,332 --> 01:09:30,250
He's gotta fake left
two sweep right.

1101
01:09:30,334 --> 01:09:34,254
Usually a good gainer
if I can sell the fake.

1102
01:09:34,338 --> 01:09:37,007
Wha... Take him to the station.

1103
01:09:39,635 --> 01:09:41,929
<i>We're looking for a kid
in a bloody T-shirt.</i>

1104
01:09:42,012 --> 01:09:44,556
At the parade.
Hold.

1105
01:10:12,876 --> 01:10:15,879
<i>Hey, hey. Hey, you.</i>

1106
01:11:15,063 --> 01:11:17,107
Please be all right.

1107
01:11:20,402 --> 01:11:23,530
<i>Ooh-hoo.</i>

1108
01:11:23,614 --> 01:11:25,657
She's not in there.

1109
01:11:25,741 --> 01:11:28,327
Where is she?

1110
01:11:28,410 --> 01:11:31,497
Travis.

1111
01:11:31,580 --> 01:11:33,874
You're a caution.

1112
01:11:33,957 --> 01:11:36,168
You know what a caution is?

1113
01:11:36,251 --> 01:11:38,337
It's a troublemaker.

1114
01:11:40,756 --> 01:11:43,175
So, you and I...

1115
01:11:43,258 --> 01:11:44,676
we're gonna do a little job.

1116
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:46,678
Put your hands
behind your back.

1117
01:11:46,762 --> 01:11:49,014
You wanna help me on a little
job, don't you, Travis?

1118
01:11:49,097 --> 01:11:51,183
What freaking job?

1119
01:11:51,266 --> 01:11:54,353
You're just a typical teenager, aren't you?
Just mention work...

1120
01:11:57,981 --> 01:12:00,400
Where the hell is Abby?

1121
01:12:00,484 --> 01:12:02,694
What are you, in love
with her or something?

1122
01:12:02,778 --> 01:12:05,531
I think you have
a crush on her.

1123
01:12:05,614 --> 01:12:08,408
Stand up.
Come on.

1124
01:12:08,492 --> 01:12:11,411
About face.
Let's go.

1125
01:12:16,959 --> 01:12:21,255
Phil, you don't really think he's
gonna come back here again, do you?

1126
01:12:21,338 --> 01:12:23,215
What if he did?

1127
01:12:23,298 --> 01:12:27,219
Vaughn might be just a tab
bit upset, don't you think?

1128
01:12:31,682 --> 01:12:33,517
Vaughn.

1129
01:12:40,524 --> 01:12:42,317
It's Phil Nickerson.

1130
01:12:47,823 --> 01:12:50,033
I don't know.
Maybe he went out with someone.

1131
01:12:51,326 --> 01:12:54,413
Yeah. Lights are on.

1132
01:12:54,496 --> 01:12:56,415
Nobody's home.

1133
01:12:56,498 --> 01:12:58,083
I don't like this.

1134
01:12:58,166 --> 01:12:59,918
<i>I'm gonna check
around the back.</i>

1135
01:13:21,523 --> 01:13:23,275
<i>Vaughn?</i>

1136
01:13:24,568 --> 01:13:25,986
<i>Vaughn.</i>

1137
01:13:28,572 --> 01:13:30,616
Sshhh.

1138
01:13:30,699 --> 01:13:32,743
<i>Vaughn, its Nickerson.</i>

1139
01:13:54,264 --> 01:13:56,391
Everything looks okay.

1140
01:13:58,435 --> 01:14:00,020
Let's go.

1141
01:14:02,564 --> 01:14:05,150
You set up the town, son.

1142
01:14:05,233 --> 01:14:06,485
Come on.

1143
01:14:06,568 --> 01:14:08,320
I got a surprise for you.

1144
01:14:08,403 --> 01:14:10,489
You can see now.

1145
01:14:10,572 --> 01:14:12,282
Both of our girls.

1146
01:14:13,909 --> 01:14:15,327
Get in.

1147
01:14:15,410 --> 01:14:18,080
Get in.
There you go.

1148
01:14:21,583 --> 01:14:23,502
Everyone nice and cozy.

1149
01:14:25,253 --> 01:14:26,880
Brace yourself.

1150
01:14:33,804 --> 01:14:36,515
Travis.

1151
01:14:36,598 --> 01:14:39,226
I'm scared.

1152
01:14:39,309 --> 01:14:41,061
Me, too.

1153
01:14:51,613 --> 01:14:53,240
<i>Where are we going?</i>

1154
01:14:54,992 --> 01:14:56,535
I don't know.

1155
01:15:00,288 --> 01:15:02,541
He's not gonna
let us go, is he?

1156
01:15:05,002 --> 01:15:07,838
I don't think
he lets people go, Abby.

1157
01:15:10,007 --> 01:15:11,925
I'm sorry.

1158
01:15:14,636 --> 01:15:16,680
You came back for me.

1159
01:15:19,516 --> 01:15:22,060
Listen.
You're gonna get out of here.

1160
01:15:22,144 --> 01:15:24,104
Look at me.
Look at me.

1161
01:15:24,187 --> 01:15:25,731
You're gonna get out of here.

1162
01:15:25,814 --> 01:15:28,358
Bite the duct tape.
Bite it.

1163
01:15:31,653 --> 01:15:34,614
Now, when you get out of here,
I want you to run for help...

1164
01:15:34,698 --> 01:15:37,743
but he might come after you, so
stay off the main roads, okay?

1165
01:15:37,826 --> 01:15:40,579
You hear me? Yes, you are.
Yes, you are.

1166
01:15:40,662 --> 01:15:43,081
Okay?
I'll find you.

1167
01:15:43,165 --> 01:15:44,750
Okay?

1168
01:15:44,833 --> 01:15:47,252
I'm not leaving you, Travis.

1169
01:15:47,335 --> 01:15:50,130
Yes, you are.
Now bite it. Go.

1170
01:15:50,213 --> 01:15:51,590
Bite!

1171
01:16:46,228 --> 01:16:48,522
Okay...

1172
01:16:48,605 --> 01:16:51,191
Come on, Travis.
We got a little job to do.

1173
01:16:51,274 --> 01:16:53,485
Let's go.

1174
01:16:53,568 --> 01:16:56,154
You're gonna need this.

1175
01:16:56,238 --> 01:16:57,572
Come on.

1176
01:17:00,242 --> 01:17:02,452
You girls sit tight.

1177
01:17:04,913 --> 01:17:07,541
Right over here.
Come on.

1178
01:17:16,424 --> 01:17:19,344
Ah, man.
I've done that up tight.

1179
01:17:19,427 --> 01:17:21,680
Okay.
Here you go.

1180
01:17:21,763 --> 01:17:23,640
All right.

1181
01:17:24,808 --> 01:17:27,102
Dig.
Right here.

1182
01:17:34,151 --> 01:17:36,153
Dig faster.

1183
01:18:24,993 --> 01:18:26,786
Keep digging...

1184
01:18:41,218 --> 01:18:43,553
Thank you for your
patience, sweetheart.

1185
01:18:45,347 --> 01:18:47,057
<i>Almost done.</i>

1186
01:19:32,269 --> 01:19:34,980
<i>All right', that's enough.</i>

1187
01:19:35,063 --> 01:19:37,357
Put the shovel on the side.

1188
01:19:43,238 --> 01:19:44,614
Open it.

1189
01:20:08,430 --> 01:20:11,016
I'm a mortician and
that makes me gag.

1190
01:20:14,269 --> 01:20:15,729
<i>Who is this?</i>

1191
01:20:15,812 --> 01:20:18,523
That's Jack, Travis.

1192
01:20:18,606 --> 01:20:22,527
<i>The two of you are gonna be great
friends. You're gonna be roomies...</i>

1193
01:20:22,610 --> 01:20:24,237
Who is this?

1194
01:20:25,947 --> 01:20:29,075
Oh, would... Yeah,
you're a junior, right?

1195
01:20:29,159 --> 01:20:32,537
<i>Si! via Moore is
your English teacher.</i>

1196
01:20:32,620 --> 01:20:36,708
That's Silvia's long
lost husband, Jack.

1197
01:20:42,839 --> 01:20:44,215
Why did you put him in there?

1198
01:20:44,299 --> 01:20:47,093
You're young, stupid...

1199
01:20:47,177 --> 01:20:49,554
so you don't know
these things, okay?

1200
01:20:49,637 --> 01:20:52,891
When another man
fucks your wife...

1201
01:20:52,974 --> 01:20:54,601
<i>there's gotta be some payback.</i>

1202
01:20:54,684 --> 01:20:56,644
You have to punish him.

1203
01:21:00,190 --> 01:21:02,734
I had to punish
my Rosemary, too...

1204
01:21:02,817 --> 01:21:04,611
and that broke my heart.

1205
01:21:06,071 --> 01:21:08,114
But she asked
for forgiveness...

1206
01:21:08,198 --> 01:21:10,742
and I have a soft spot
for those that I love...

1207
01:21:10,825 --> 01:21:14,037
so I told her that she
could stay home with me.

1208
01:21:17,832 --> 01:21:20,794
But she's dead.

1209
01:21:20,877 --> 01:21:23,254
Oh, we had a funeral.

1210
01:21:23,338 --> 01:21:25,965
I put a casket in the ground
but she wasn't in it.

1211
01:21:26,049 --> 01:21:29,094
Jack there, Jack was
at the funeral.

1212
01:21:29,177 --> 01:21:32,097
He just sat there the whole
time looking at me...

1213
01:21:32,180 --> 01:21:36,267
like I had no idea that
he was screwing my wife.

1214
01:21:36,351 --> 01:21:38,812
Joke's on you.

1215
01:21:38,895 --> 01:21:42,273
Ha-ha.

1216
01:21:42,357 --> 01:21:47,112
<i>Rose, she and I
are doing fine...</i>

1217
01:21:47,195 --> 01:21:49,531
Never better.

1218
01:21:51,032 --> 01:21:53,785
Until you came along...

1219
01:21:53,868 --> 01:21:55,620
causing all that trouble.

1220
01:21:55,703 --> 01:21:58,331
You're a psycho.
You know that?

1221
01:22:00,208 --> 01:22:02,669
I'm love sick is what I am.

1222
01:22:02,752 --> 01:22:06,131
Because of you, I had to put
Rose into the ground...

1223
01:22:06,214 --> 01:22:09,968
until the shit storm that
you caused blows over.

1224
01:22:10,051 --> 01:22:14,305
<i>Now, get his maggot eating
ass out of there. Now.</i>

1225
01:22:14,389 --> 01:22:17,851
Don't you make me do it or I'll
put a bullet in your head first.

1226
01:22:27,610 --> 01:22:29,487
<i>Ashes to ashes.</i>

1227
01:22:29,571 --> 01:22:31,322
<i>Shit to shit.</i>

1228
01:22:31,406 --> 01:22:32,782
<i>Dirty work, huh?</i>

1229
01:22:34,284 --> 01:22:36,119
<i>You know, don't you worry.</i>

1230
01:22:36,202 --> 01:22:38,538
<i>I got a nice old spot'
picked out for you...</i>

1231
01:22:38,621 --> 01:22:41,040
and Jackie here and
your little girlfriend.

1232
01:22:42,917 --> 01:22:44,836
No.

1233
01:22:44,919 --> 01:22:48,840
Rosemary wouldn't like it.

1234
01:22:48,923 --> 01:22:52,051
<i>She knows what' you did to her.</i>

1235
01:22:52,135 --> 01:22:53,845
What are you talking about?

1236
01:22:53,928 --> 01:22:58,183
When you put her in and
you shut that lid...

1237
01:22:58,266 --> 01:23:00,852
and throw that dirt on her,
she's gonna hear it.

1238
01:23:00,935 --> 01:23:03,188
And you think she's
gonna like it?

1239
01:23:03,271 --> 01:23:06,691
No. She's gonna
be pissed.

1240
01:23:06,774 --> 01:23:10,528
Rosemary understands
it's only temporary.

1241
01:23:10,612 --> 01:23:12,739
Oh, does she?

1242
01:23:12,822 --> 01:23:16,034
<i>Might be forever 'cause she
knows you don't mean it.</i>

1243
01:23:16,117 --> 01:23:17,702
Shut up!

1244
01:23:17,785 --> 01:23:19,037
She hates you.

1245
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:21,206
Shut up!
Shut up...

1246
01:23:21,289 --> 01:23:24,209
or I'll put a bullet in your
sorry little ass right now.

1247
01:23:31,299 --> 01:23:33,801
How about you go
ask her for yourself?

1248
01:23:35,303 --> 01:23:38,056
She's right behind you.

1249
01:23:38,139 --> 01:23:40,183
<i>Oh, you think I'm joking? Look.</i>

1250
01:23:47,649 --> 01:23:49,317
Rose?

1251
01:23:51,027 --> 01:23:53,530
Vaughn, you don't
know what it was like...

1252
01:23:55,323 --> 01:23:57,450
to die alone.

1253
01:23:59,827 --> 01:24:01,538
How do you live with yourself?

1254
01:24:03,665 --> 01:24:04,958
Don't be hateful.

1255
01:24:07,001 --> 01:24:09,003
<i>You're disgusting.</i>

1256
01:24:10,171 --> 01:24:11,589
I hate you.

1257
01:24:11,673 --> 01:24:14,217
No. Don't be hateful.

1258
01:24:16,553 --> 01:24:18,638
I hate you.

1259
01:24:22,225 --> 01:24:23,893
I hate you.

1260
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:29,148
You're not my Rosemary.

1261
01:24:41,744 --> 01:24:43,288
Go to hell.

1262
01:24:51,379 --> 01:24:53,756
Get in!

1263
01:24:55,883 --> 01:24:57,343
Die.

1264
01:24:57,427 --> 01:24:58,928
No!

1265
01:25:05,727 --> 01:25:07,186
<i>Rose!</i>

1266
01:25:07,270 --> 01:25:08,938
Help me!
Help!

1267
01:25:32,587 --> 01:25:34,380
Abby.

1268
01:26:31,312 --> 01:26:33,106
Like I said on the phone...

1269
01:26:33,189 --> 01:26:35,108
you're gonna be mighty proud.

1270
01:26:35,191 --> 01:26:37,902
We are proud...

1271
01:26:37,985 --> 01:26:40,279
of both of them.

1272
01:26:40,363 --> 01:26:42,740
<i>The kids did a really
smart thing out there.</i>

1273
01:26:42,824 --> 01:26:45,868
They came right here
after it happened.

1274
01:26:47,495 --> 01:26:50,289
<i>By the time we dug him up...</i>

1275
01:26:50,373 --> 01:26:53,084
old Vaughn had been in
there over two hours.

1276
01:26:58,673 --> 01:27:00,550
What are they gonna
do with him now?

1277
01:27:15,398 --> 01:27:16,733
You know...

1278
01:27:19,193 --> 01:27:22,447
you came back for me.

1279
01:27:22,530 --> 01:27:25,116
I guess that makes us even.

1280
01:27:27,368 --> 01:27:28,911
Come here.

1281
01:28:07,074 --> 01:28:10,244
<i>Woo-hoo. Hey!</i>

1282
01:28:12,288 --> 01:28:14,373
Hey!

1283
01:28:14,457 --> 01:28:16,626
I'm feeling better now.

1284
01:28:21,631 --> 01:28:25,259
God. First chance I get,
I'm so out of here.

1285
01:28:28,638 --> 01:28:29,847
Huh?

1286
01:28:29,931 --> 01:28:31,891
Hey!

1287
01:28:37,647 --> 01:28:39,982
Ah. Huh?

1288
01:28:41,776 --> 01:28:43,361
Huh?

1289
01:28:48,616 --> 01:28:50,326
Love sucks.

1290
01:28:53,788 --> 01:28:55,832
<i>All right.</i>

1291
01:29:02,463 --> 01:29:06,884
<i>♫ Ah ah Ah ah ♫</i>
