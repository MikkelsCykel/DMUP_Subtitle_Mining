00:01:50,932 --> 00:01:53,651
Senor?

2
00:01:53,892 --> 00:01:57,851
-Have you seen this woman?
-No, Senor.

3
00:01:58,092 --> 00:01:59,445
Gracias.

4
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:55,251
Senor? Senor?

5
00:03:57,852 --> 00:03:59,444
Gracias.

6
00:04:05,532 --> 00:04:09,684
1 0, 4 2, 36, hut, hut, hut!

7
00:04:16,732 --> 00:04:18,404
Way to go, Brogan!

8
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:21,042
The old man can still catch, huh?

9
00:04:23,332 --> 00:04:25,448
Take care of that shoulder.
Good job.

10
00:04:25,652 --> 00:04:27,563
Nice legs, but watch
this one.

11
00:04:27,812 --> 00:04:29,245
Brogan!

12
00:04:35,812 --> 00:04:37,848
l didn't like what l saw on Sunday.

13
00:04:39,532 --> 00:04:41,488
What? l caught
the winning touchdown.

14
00:04:41,732 --> 00:04:44,121
You missed that track-back block.

15
00:04:44,932 --> 00:04:46,604
You were worried about your shoulder.

16
00:04:46,812 --> 00:04:48,689
Doctor says
there's no permanent damage.

17
00:04:49,492 --> 00:04:52,882
l don't want any weaknesses
read by the other team.

18
00:04:53,292 --> 00:04:55,442
You took yourself off
the injured reserve.

19
00:04:55,652 --> 00:04:57,085
You said you were healthy.

20
00:04:57,332 --> 00:04:59,084
The shoulder is solid.

21
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:00,765
Why don't you prove that?

22
00:05:01,012 --> 00:05:01,967
l intend to.

23
00:05:02,212 --> 00:05:03,361
l mean right now.

24
00:05:04,492 --> 00:05:06,050
Mrs. Wyler's paying you...

25
00:05:06,292 --> 00:05:08,408
...to play football, not
talk about it.

26
00:05:08,652 --> 00:05:10,847
Why don't you go over to the sled?

27
00:05:11,532 --> 00:05:12,885
The sled is bullshit.

28
00:05:13,132 --> 00:05:15,965
l got two rookies who
need playing time, Brogan.

29
00:05:16,212 --> 00:05:18,851
Either go to the sled or
sit on the bench.

30
00:05:20,732 --> 00:05:24,247
No, Stassen. l'll go over
there and prove it to you.

31
00:05:24,492 --> 00:05:26,403
Sam! Go with him.

32
00:05:27,532 --> 00:05:28,647
Come on, Sam.

33
00:05:28,852 --> 00:05:31,082
No matter how long you play,
they want you...

34
00:05:31,332 --> 00:05:32,560
...to prove it one more time.

35
00:05:32,812 --> 00:05:33,801
North field scrimmage.

36
00:05:34,052 --> 00:05:36,612
That guy's been on my ass
since he got here.

37
00:05:43,492 --> 00:05:45,642
Here we go.
All right, hand down.

38
00:05:45,892 --> 00:05:47,325
Look at me. Ready.

39
00:05:47,572 --> 00:05:49,164
Hit it!

40
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:55,091
Sam, get on it.

41
00:06:00,532 --> 00:06:02,409
All right, hand down.
Look at me.

42
00:06:02,652 --> 00:06:03,971
Hit it!

43
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:06,528
Fuck!

44
00:06:07,452 --> 00:06:11,604
Sully! l'd like you to meet our
County Supervisor, Ed Phillips.

45
00:06:11,852 --> 00:06:13,763
He's Mrs. Wyler's guest today.

46
00:06:15,092 --> 00:06:16,161
l'm a big fan.

47
00:06:16,412 --> 00:06:19,927
Not only of the Outlaws, but of
the football you played.

48
00:06:20,812 --> 00:06:23,042
Football's changed since
l was a player.

49
00:06:23,492 --> 00:06:24,527
Right, right.

50
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:27,129
l guess that run of injuries...

51
00:06:27,372 --> 00:06:29,090
...kind of hurt you guys.

52
00:06:29,332 --> 00:06:31,163
We had a lousy bench last year.

53
00:06:31,412 --> 00:06:34,131
We had to play a lot
of injured ball players.

54
00:06:34,372 --> 00:06:36,090
That's part of the job.

55
00:06:36,332 --> 00:06:38,004
You never played injured?

56
00:06:38,252 --> 00:06:39,651
Yeah, well, l was dumb.

57
00:06:39,892 --> 00:06:42,360
l don't like my boys
getting hurt permanently.

58
00:06:43,132 --> 00:06:44,690
That's why they
call him '' Mother.''

59
00:06:44,932 --> 00:06:46,251
Hit it!

60
00:06:46,852 --> 00:06:48,843
l don't know about being a supervisor.

61
00:06:49,092 --> 00:06:51,652
l sure as hell don't know
about being a lawyer.

62
00:06:51,852 --> 00:06:56,323
But if l was a lawyer l wouldn't know
shit about football, would l?

63
00:06:56,572 --> 00:06:57,846
Excuse me.

64
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:01,324
Let's get out of here.

65
00:07:01,572 --> 00:07:02,846
Hit it!

66
00:07:05,052 --> 00:07:07,088
You don't have to do this, Brogan.

67
00:07:07,332 --> 00:07:08,685
The fucker's not beating me.

68
00:07:11,612 --> 00:07:12,965
Hand down again. Look at me!

69
00:07:13,212 --> 00:07:14,247
Hit it!

70
00:07:16,412 --> 00:07:19,449
l'm the trainer here, and l say
he's had enough.

71
00:07:21,052 --> 00:07:23,168
What're you trying to prove?
You're a veteran!

72
00:07:23,412 --> 00:07:26,245
What a dumb fucking thing
to have me do!

73
00:07:27,092 --> 00:07:29,242
Wait for me in my office, Brogan.

74
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:47,926
Steve Kirsch's office.

75
00:07:48,172 --> 00:07:51,244
This is Terry Brogan.
l need to speak to Steve.

76
00:07:53,492 --> 00:07:56,928
The Outlaws just put me on waivers.

77
00:07:57,172 --> 00:07:58,685
l'm sorry to hear that.

78
00:07:58,932 --> 00:08:01,048
l'm a big fan of yours, Terry.

79
00:08:01,292 --> 00:08:03,965
Hold, please. lt's Terry Brogan.
He's been cut.

80
00:08:04,212 --> 00:08:06,487
-Call Schumacher.
-He needs to talk to you.

81
00:08:06,732 --> 00:08:08,051
l don't handle players.

82
00:08:08,932 --> 00:08:09,842
Get rid of him.

83
00:08:13,812 --> 00:08:18,442
Hello. Mr. Kirsch can't talk, but
he suggests you call Hal Schumacher.

84
00:08:18,692 --> 00:08:21,684
l don't want
Hal Schumacher l want Steve.

85
00:08:21,932 --> 00:08:23,001
When's he available?

86
00:08:23,452 --> 00:08:24,965
l really don't know.

87
00:08:26,732 --> 00:08:29,007
Thank you. Thanks a lot.

88
00:08:36,732 --> 00:08:38,882
-They screw up my shoulder, then cut me.
-Shit!

89
00:08:39,092 --> 00:08:40,764
That's it in a word.

90
00:08:41,012 --> 00:08:42,684
They promised they'd keep you.

91
00:08:42,932 --> 00:08:44,570
This is behind my back, kid.

92
00:08:44,812 --> 00:08:46,245
Yeah, l figured.

93
00:08:47,252 --> 00:08:49,447
At first l thought
they'd pay me off.

94
00:08:49,652 --> 00:08:51,085
But l want to play football.

95
00:08:51,332 --> 00:08:53,368
Not this year.
Not with that shoulder.

96
00:08:53,612 --> 00:08:55,091
Let me ask you something.

97
00:08:55,332 --> 00:08:57,562
What makes you think
they'll pay you off?

98
00:08:58,612 --> 00:08:59,647
l was injured.

99
00:08:59,932 --> 00:09:03,561
You played two games great. lf you're
injured, you didn't look it.

100
00:09:03,892 --> 00:09:05,291
What was l supposed to do?

101
00:09:05,532 --> 00:09:08,205
lf l give them any trouble,
they cut me.

102
00:09:08,452 --> 00:09:09,885
They cut you anyway.

103
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:13,124
They're rebuilding.
More profit, less talent.

104
00:09:13,372 --> 00:09:14,646
You cost too much.

105
00:09:14,892 --> 00:09:17,247
They're not screwing me around.

106
00:09:17,532 --> 00:09:19,090
l'm gonna see my lawyer.

107
00:09:21,932 --> 00:09:23,160
l'll miss the pressure.

108
00:09:29,932 --> 00:09:31,445
Give me a call.

109
00:09:38,332 --> 00:09:40,766
Caxton, Benjamin, Parker and Stein.

110
00:09:41,012 --> 00:09:42,889
Yes, he is.
Hold on a moment.

111
00:09:43,132 --> 00:09:43,928
May l help you?

112
00:09:44,132 --> 00:09:48,045
-l'm here to see Steve Kirsch.
-l'll ring his office.

113
00:09:48,292 --> 00:09:49,645
Hello.

114
00:09:51,332 --> 00:09:52,890
l'm here to see Steve Kirsch.

115
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:56,368
l know. l'm the one you've been
talking to all day.

116
00:09:56,612 --> 00:09:58,045
The one who's a big fan?

117
00:09:58,252 --> 00:09:59,446
What's your name?

118
00:09:59,652 --> 00:10:00,482
Edie.

119
00:10:00,732 --> 00:10:03,041
Edie, he's not ever
going to talk to me?

120
00:10:03,252 --> 00:10:05,641
You're down in my book to call.

121
00:10:06,332 --> 00:10:08,641
-Where's his office?
-He's not here.

122
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:12,047
l know you gotta keep your job, Edie.

123
00:10:12,252 --> 00:10:13,526
You have a nice face. l--

124
00:10:13,772 --> 00:10:15,444
l'm telling you the truth.

125
00:10:16,292 --> 00:10:19,443
lt wouldn't be out of line for
you to lie, would it?

126
00:10:22,732 --> 00:10:24,051
Where is he?

127
00:10:31,732 --> 00:10:34,121
Terry! lt's good to see you.

128
00:10:34,372 --> 00:10:35,646
l'm cut from the Outlaws.

129
00:10:36,332 --> 00:10:39,449
l know, l heard. The firm
represents Mrs. Wyler.

130
00:10:42,852 --> 00:10:45,320
Since l joined the firm,
l can't represent players.

131
00:10:45,932 --> 00:10:48,446
Mrs. Wyler owns the Outlaws.
She's our biggest client.

132
00:10:48,972 --> 00:10:50,371
lt's a conflict of interest.

133
00:10:50,612 --> 00:10:54,082
Wait a minute. When you came
hustling me in school...

134
00:10:54,332 --> 00:10:56,846
...l put my career in your hands.
Remember?

135
00:10:57,412 --> 00:10:59,801
You're right.
l'm sorry. Sit down.

136
00:11:03,692 --> 00:11:05,284
l've been playing injured.

137
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:08,171
They know, but they don't
want to pay me off.

138
00:11:08,732 --> 00:11:11,326
l think that's what their
position's gonna be.

139
00:11:11,572 --> 00:11:12,846
Their position's fucked.

140
00:11:13,052 --> 00:11:14,963
l'll go to the Players' Association.

141
00:11:15,532 --> 00:11:17,443
You could do that, but listen.

142
00:11:17,652 --> 00:11:21,440
What happens if the Outlaws prove
that you're perfectly fine?

143
00:11:21,932 --> 00:11:24,810
They've got film when you're
in practice, games.

144
00:11:25,332 --> 00:11:28,642
They're gonna fight for
a long, long time.

145
00:11:29,532 --> 00:11:33,241
Steve, look.

146
00:11:34,092 --> 00:11:36,287
l'm having money problems, man.

147
00:11:36,492 --> 00:11:37,288
l'm broke.

148
00:11:39,612 --> 00:11:41,807
Did you spend every cent
you ever made?

149
00:11:46,132 --> 00:11:48,851
Let me think for
just a second here.

150
00:11:52,452 --> 00:11:55,250
l should get you a low-interest loan
to tide you over.

151
00:11:56,332 --> 00:11:58,129
-Excuse me--
-Could you wait, please?

152
00:12:00,692 --> 00:12:03,923
l'll talk to these guys,
see if l can soften their position...

153
00:12:04,172 --> 00:12:06,845
...and get you something so
it's not a hassle.

154
00:12:08,452 --> 00:12:10,363
Excuse me, Mr. Kirsch.
The reception?

155
00:12:10,652 --> 00:12:11,641
Mr. Caxton's waiting.

156
00:12:11,892 --> 00:12:14,042
Right, l forgot. l gotta go.

157
00:12:14,292 --> 00:12:16,044
l gotta know about this soon.

158
00:12:17,132 --> 00:12:18,770
l'll get on it first thing.

159
00:12:19,012 --> 00:12:21,401
You're one of my first players, huh?

160
00:12:29,212 --> 00:12:31,567
Mike Hogan and his wife, Susan.
Ben Cassidy.

161
00:12:31,812 --> 00:12:32,961
Thank you for coming.

162
00:12:40,692 --> 00:12:42,284
Here's Hal Schumacher's number.

163
00:12:42,532 --> 00:12:44,966
Call him. He's a nice man.

164
00:12:45,212 --> 00:12:47,851
Do they always get bombed
at the end of the day?

165
00:12:48,332 --> 00:12:51,449
lt's business down there.
lt's an intimate fundraiser.

166
00:12:51,652 --> 00:12:52,448
What do you mean?

167
00:12:52,692 --> 00:12:54,762
Mr. Caxton has assessed every lawyer...

168
00:12:55,012 --> 00:12:59,244
...$1 500 to contribute to the
reelection of Councilman Weinberg.

169
00:12:59,692 --> 00:13:03,048
Mrs. Wyler is Caxton's
biggest client, isn't she?

170
00:13:03,252 --> 00:13:06,085
Yes. ln fact, he's doing business
for her right now.

171
00:13:06,332 --> 00:13:07,685
Yeah? For the Outlaws?

172
00:13:07,932 --> 00:13:11,049
No. Mrs. Wyler's real business
is real estate.

173
00:13:11,252 --> 00:13:14,289
Caxton wants a zoning variance
on Wyler's canyon...

174
00:13:14,532 --> 00:13:16,409
...so she can build houses there.

175
00:13:16,652 --> 00:13:19,371
His guest of honour tonight
could vote against it.

176
00:13:19,612 --> 00:13:21,728
Trust me, he won't now.

177
00:13:26,932 --> 00:13:30,845
l hate things like before.
When l couldn't be straight with you.

178
00:13:33,532 --> 00:13:35,682
l'm running out of conversation.

179
00:13:35,932 --> 00:13:37,285
l'm sorry.

180
00:13:37,492 --> 00:13:38,288
l gotta go.

181
00:13:38,492 --> 00:13:40,562
l'd like to have a drink with you.

182
00:13:40,812 --> 00:13:42,165
The Ginger Man, after work?

183
00:13:42,412 --> 00:13:44,323
Okay, sure. The Ginger Man.

184
00:14:04,812 --> 00:14:06,245
Touchdown.

185
00:14:08,012 --> 00:14:12,369
What are you doing here? You been cut.
They can get you for trespassing.

186
00:14:12,612 --> 00:14:14,250
l'd outrun them.

187
00:14:15,492 --> 00:14:16,766
Why are you here, Tommy?

188
00:14:17,252 --> 00:14:18,526
Jake wants to see you.

189
00:14:20,132 --> 00:14:20,928
How is Jake?

190
00:14:21,532 --> 00:14:23,329
He got stabbed last week.

191
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:24,965
What a shame.

192
00:14:26,132 --> 00:14:28,009
He survived, Brogan.

193
00:14:31,612 --> 00:14:32,761
Why does he want me?

194
00:14:33,292 --> 00:14:35,442
He might have a job for you.

195
00:14:36,452 --> 00:14:38,329
You tell him '' No thanks.''

196
00:14:38,572 --> 00:14:40,164
He'll be at the beach tomorrow.

197
00:14:41,332 --> 00:14:42,651
There's a volleyball game.

198
00:14:42,892 --> 00:14:44,120
Yeah? ls he playing?

199
00:14:45,532 --> 00:14:47,409
l told you, he got stabbed, man.

200
00:14:49,092 --> 00:14:50,445
Well, he lived, right?

201
00:14:52,812 --> 00:14:55,087
You got problems now, Terry.

202
00:14:55,332 --> 00:14:56,560
You want trouble too?

203
00:15:02,212 --> 00:15:04,282
Come to the beach tomorrow.

204
00:15:04,532 --> 00:15:06,045
You're not dumb.

205
00:15:06,252 --> 00:15:07,844
Besides...

206
00:15:08,332 --> 00:15:10,448
...what the hell else you got to do?

207
00:15:24,292 --> 00:15:25,645
Sam!

208
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,650
Sam!

209
00:15:30,612 --> 00:15:32,045
Come here!

210
00:15:33,492 --> 00:15:34,845
You look good as a cripple.

211
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:39,083
ls that why l had to come here,
to give you my opinion?

212
00:15:39,332 --> 00:15:40,685
How are you doing?

213
00:15:40,932 --> 00:15:42,285
Lousy.

214
00:15:42,732 --> 00:15:43,881
How's your life?

215
00:15:44,132 --> 00:15:46,646
Club? The Palace
is doing great.

216
00:15:46,852 --> 00:15:50,606
The other business is even better.
My action's half a million a week.

217
00:15:50,852 --> 00:15:55,130
You know the grand prize for
the guys who win? Thirty grand.

218
00:15:55,332 --> 00:15:57,687
lt's not bad, is it?
A few hours on the beach.

219
00:15:57,932 --> 00:16:01,049
Don't tell me you're taking
action on this game?

220
00:16:01,892 --> 00:16:03,564
You think these are beach rats?

221
00:16:05,892 --> 00:16:07,610
These are world-class players.

222
00:16:07,852 --> 00:16:09,365
You didn't know that?

223
00:16:10,372 --> 00:16:12,442
Sam, come here!

224
00:16:13,412 --> 00:16:16,370
People love to bet on sports.
l just help them out.

225
00:16:17,692 --> 00:16:20,570
South Bay guys love this game,
and they got money.

226
00:16:20,812 --> 00:16:21,881
l'll take their action.

227
00:16:22,132 --> 00:16:24,851
Who's the fuzzy face?
Do you wanna cookie?

228
00:16:25,052 --> 00:16:26,246
There's one!

229
00:16:26,932 --> 00:16:28,650
You fuzzy face, come on!

230
00:16:28,932 --> 00:16:31,366
What kind of dog is gonna
hang out with you?

231
00:16:31,612 --> 00:16:33,170
He doesn't belong to me.

232
00:16:33,412 --> 00:16:35,243
He belongs to the lady who cut me.

233
00:16:35,932 --> 00:16:38,241
You're into violent women now?

234
00:16:38,452 --> 00:16:40,443
Look, l was a bit of an asshole.

235
00:16:40,932 --> 00:16:44,242
l got crazy and popped her.
She came after me with a knife.

236
00:16:44,492 --> 00:16:45,845
Just missed my balls.

237
00:16:46,052 --> 00:16:47,883
And was she going for them?

238
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,451
Don't they all?

239
00:16:52,132 --> 00:16:54,043
You got a new Porsche, huh?

240
00:16:54,332 --> 00:16:56,448
What the fuck,
you're rich, right?

241
00:16:56,812 --> 00:16:59,804
Let's talk it over at
the Palace. What do you say?

242
00:17:01,012 --> 00:17:02,525
We'll go like the old days.

243
00:17:02,732 --> 00:17:04,051
You up to it?

244
00:17:04,932 --> 00:17:06,411
Come on, Sam. Come on!

245
00:17:06,652 --> 00:17:08,051
Come on, get in the car.

246
00:17:08,292 --> 00:17:10,044
l'll just meet you there.

247
00:17:10,412 --> 00:17:12,448
You get afraid of me
in your old age?

248
00:17:12,652 --> 00:17:13,607
Yeah, right.

249
00:17:13,852 --> 00:17:14,807
Come on.

250
00:17:15,332 --> 00:17:18,369
Be a good release. Need to
release a little tension?

251
00:17:19,212 --> 00:17:21,328
Do l have to tie one leg
behind my back?

252
00:17:21,572 --> 00:17:22,846
Take the old route.

253
00:17:23,052 --> 00:17:24,087
Sunset.

254
00:17:38,332 --> 00:17:40,163
Let's see if you still got balls!

255
00:18:04,492 --> 00:18:07,052
-How'd you like that?
-Damn good!

256
00:18:24,132 --> 00:18:24,928
Where were you?

257
00:18:32,212 --> 00:18:33,008
That was smart.

258
00:18:34,332 --> 00:18:35,287
See you!

259
00:19:00,332 --> 00:19:01,890
You're still number two!

260
00:19:02,132 --> 00:19:03,770
Dream on, Terry!

261
00:19:07,292 --> 00:19:08,850
Son of a bitch!

262
00:19:20,052 --> 00:19:21,405
What a fucking idiot!

263
00:19:21,652 --> 00:19:22,926
Scared the shit out of you?

264
00:19:24,452 --> 00:19:27,489
l'm an asshole for racing with you!
l'm pulling out!

265
00:19:27,732 --> 00:19:29,962
Come on, don't pussy out on me now!

266
00:19:34,812 --> 00:19:35,608
The fun's over!

267
00:19:37,812 --> 00:19:38,881
Not yet!

268
00:20:13,892 --> 00:20:16,281
Sam, be quiet! Get over here.

269
00:20:17,452 --> 00:20:19,249
What kept you?
l was getting worried.

270
00:20:19,452 --> 00:20:22,649
l was afraid you got stuck
in all that garbage.

271
00:20:22,892 --> 00:20:25,247
Can't have a fair race with
a goddamn maniac.

272
00:20:25,492 --> 00:20:27,448
Here, maybe this will fix you up.

273
00:20:28,932 --> 00:20:30,650
Have a taste of this.

274
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:35,285
How about a Guinness?

275
00:20:35,532 --> 00:20:37,170
Wanna tell me what
l'm doing here?

276
00:20:37,412 --> 00:20:39,164
You're out of a job, right?

277
00:20:39,412 --> 00:20:41,642
l've got some job
possibilities for you.

278
00:20:41,932 --> 00:20:44,366
For one, you can work right back here.

279
00:20:44,612 --> 00:20:45,886
Celebrity bartender.

280
00:20:46,132 --> 00:20:49,442
Making drinks and telling
football stories to drunks.

281
00:20:49,652 --> 00:20:50,846
How does that sound?

282
00:20:51,092 --> 00:20:53,970
You take the job. You're
a lot funnier than l am.

283
00:20:54,212 --> 00:20:55,850
How about security guard?

284
00:20:56,052 --> 00:20:57,883
l mean, you know how to get hit.

285
00:20:58,132 --> 00:21:01,249
The point is, for a guy
in your situation, Terry...

286
00:21:01,452 --> 00:21:03,443
...the options stink.

287
00:21:06,212 --> 00:21:07,804
Or you can find her for me.

288
00:21:09,652 --> 00:21:11,244
Who's this, the knife lady?

289
00:21:11,732 --> 00:21:13,848
She's very important to me, Terry.

290
00:21:14,292 --> 00:21:15,691
l think of her all the time.

291
00:21:16,452 --> 00:21:18,044
That's a new reality for you.

292
00:21:18,292 --> 00:21:21,648
She stole 50 grand from me.
l would've given her the money.

293
00:21:21,852 --> 00:21:23,046
l want her back.

294
00:21:23,252 --> 00:21:24,605
And l want you to find her.

295
00:21:25,652 --> 00:21:28,644
You're crazy. Why would you
trust me with her?

296
00:21:29,492 --> 00:21:30,720
Jessie hates ball players.

297
00:21:31,892 --> 00:21:33,450
Do you think that's funny?

298
00:21:34,652 --> 00:21:38,042
She's also Mrs. Wyler's daughter.
Did you ever meet her?

299
00:21:39,732 --> 00:21:42,530
l've heard about her. She's
supposed to be wild.

300
00:21:42,732 --> 00:21:45,451
Her father was an English guy
Mrs. Wyler married.

301
00:21:45,692 --> 00:21:49,241
One of those stage actors who
can't make it in American films.

302
00:21:49,452 --> 00:21:52,649
Anyway, after he died,
Mr. Wyler adopted her.

303
00:21:53,332 --> 00:21:55,607
An owner's daughter, living
with a bookie.

304
00:21:55,852 --> 00:21:57,365
That's something, isn't it?

305
00:21:58,092 --> 00:22:01,243
She hates her mother.
Treated her like a possession.

306
00:22:03,852 --> 00:22:07,242
You know how it is to be one
of Mrs. Wyler's possessions?

307
00:22:10,892 --> 00:22:12,962
l'll give you $1 0,000 right now.

308
00:22:13,212 --> 00:22:14,884
Pay your expenses.

309
00:22:15,132 --> 00:22:18,841
And if you find her,
l'll give you $20,000 more.

310
00:22:22,052 --> 00:22:23,883
You're crazy.
l'm a football player.

311
00:22:24,132 --> 00:22:25,645
Without a team.

312
00:22:26,132 --> 00:22:29,044
That new Porsche of yours,
is it paid for?

313
00:22:31,052 --> 00:22:33,725
What are you gonna do, man?
Sell insurance?

314
00:22:33,932 --> 00:22:37,607
You don't have the personality
to work for the networks.

315
00:22:39,252 --> 00:22:41,368
l don't want you to bring
her back, man.

316
00:22:41,612 --> 00:22:44,046
Just find her. Tell me where she is.

317
00:22:44,292 --> 00:22:47,443
What does that take? Time and money.

318
00:22:47,652 --> 00:22:50,644
You got the time right now.
l got the money.

319
00:22:51,412 --> 00:22:52,288
Great.

320
00:22:52,532 --> 00:22:55,000
You know, l've never used
what l got on you.

321
00:22:56,532 --> 00:22:57,647
Could be otherwise.

322
00:22:59,532 --> 00:23:02,251
l wouldn't want that. Would you?

323
00:23:03,692 --> 00:23:04,647
lt's simple.

324
00:23:04,852 --> 00:23:07,491
Either you want to play
football again or you don't.

325
00:23:07,732 --> 00:23:09,450
You never change, do you?

326
00:23:10,932 --> 00:23:12,001
Not a bit.

327
00:23:12,532 --> 00:23:15,649
Try Mrs. Wyler. She probably
knows where Jessie is.

328
00:23:15,892 --> 00:23:17,086
Right.

329
00:23:23,252 --> 00:23:24,651
lf this is about you being cut...

330
00:23:24,852 --> 00:23:28,128
...l don't involve myself with
day-to-day team business.

331
00:23:28,372 --> 00:23:30,647
That's not why l came here,
Mrs. Wyler.

332
00:23:32,252 --> 00:23:36,245
Then suppose you tell me exactly
what you want with me, Mr. Brogan.

333
00:23:37,372 --> 00:23:38,691
l'm looking for your daughter.

334
00:23:40,412 --> 00:23:43,609
We're very close, and she
disappeared all of a sudden.

335
00:23:45,652 --> 00:23:46,448
Give me a break.

336
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:48,245
What do you mean?

337
00:23:48,692 --> 00:23:50,045
He sent you.

338
00:23:51,732 --> 00:23:52,528
Who?

339
00:23:53,652 --> 00:23:55,005
Jake...

340
00:23:55,212 --> 00:23:56,361
...Wise.

341
00:23:57,012 --> 00:23:59,048
She was only with him to spite me.

342
00:24:00,492 --> 00:24:02,847
l don't know what she did
to get away from him.

343
00:24:03,092 --> 00:24:06,050
What matters is, she got
the hell away from him.

344
00:24:06,332 --> 00:24:07,560
Why not drink to that?

345
00:24:08,732 --> 00:24:09,801
Grace?

346
00:24:14,132 --> 00:24:17,807
Ed seems to have solved
the Soames problem.

347
00:24:18,052 --> 00:24:20,361
The head of the planning commission
is coming Saturday.

348
00:24:20,932 --> 00:24:23,605
We're finally softening up these
environmentalists.

349
00:24:23,812 --> 00:24:25,165
How wonderful.

350
00:24:26,052 --> 00:24:28,566
You seem to have won
the opposition over.

351
00:24:28,812 --> 00:24:31,121
A good project sells itself.

352
00:24:31,932 --> 00:24:33,763
MOBSO's got other mountains to save.

353
00:24:35,452 --> 00:24:36,601
You know Terry Brogan.

354
00:24:37,092 --> 00:24:37,888
How are you?

355
00:24:39,852 --> 00:24:42,412
-And Supervisor Phillips.
-l'm a big fan.

356
00:24:42,612 --> 00:24:44,045
Thanks.

357
00:24:44,332 --> 00:24:48,166
l wonder if you'd mind going ahead.
We'll be right along.

358
00:24:48,412 --> 00:24:50,164
Yes, of course.

359
00:24:50,412 --> 00:24:52,642
-Be with you in a minute.
-See you then.

360
00:24:55,932 --> 00:24:58,526
lt seems Mr. Brogan has a new job.

361
00:25:00,012 --> 00:25:02,003
Working for Jake Wise.

362
00:25:02,732 --> 00:25:03,847
Looking for Jessica.

363
00:25:05,892 --> 00:25:07,689
You and Wise good friends?

364
00:25:08,612 --> 00:25:11,570
l go to his club for the music.
So do a lot of the team.

365
00:25:14,052 --> 00:25:16,247
Why don't you let us steal
you from him?

366
00:25:16,492 --> 00:25:18,801
l won't let Jessica live like this.

367
00:25:19,012 --> 00:25:21,048
l'll double whatever he's paying you.

368
00:25:21,252 --> 00:25:23,447
l'm not some gun for hire.

369
00:25:23,692 --> 00:25:26,126
He can't top what we offer,
can he, Ben?

370
00:25:28,292 --> 00:25:30,852
He can't give you your job back
with the Outlaws.

371
00:25:34,612 --> 00:25:38,241
We could consider something.

372
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:42,484
You know, it isn't easy for
Jessica to hide from me.

373
00:25:42,732 --> 00:25:44,848
She's been drawing from her trust.

374
00:25:45,092 --> 00:25:49,165
lt's going to a little bank in Mexico.
To an island.

375
00:25:49,412 --> 00:25:51,243
Cozumel.

376
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:54,686
You could keep a watch on her.

377
00:25:54,932 --> 00:25:57,844
Make sure he gets nowhere
near her again.

378
00:26:00,412 --> 00:26:02,050
You know...

379
00:26:04,132 --> 00:26:06,771
...l used Jake Wise
as an excuse to come here.

380
00:26:07,012 --> 00:26:08,764
l did come to get my job back.

381
00:26:10,532 --> 00:26:13,729
l didn't deserve what l got.
l played some good ball.

382
00:26:14,532 --> 00:26:16,250
l got a lot of good years left.

383
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:20,484
l want to be back on the team,
but because l'm worth it.

384
00:26:20,732 --> 00:26:24,611
Not because l spied on some
25-year-old who ran away from home.

385
00:26:25,532 --> 00:26:28,251
l'm not going to spy for you
or Jake Wise.

386
00:26:28,492 --> 00:26:31,245
Ben, this young man
is trespassing here.

387
00:26:31,732 --> 00:26:33,051
Throw him out.

388
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:42,048
l don't believe you're wanted here.

389
00:26:42,732 --> 00:26:45,963
And you can forget about Kirsch.
He's on my team.

390
00:26:46,212 --> 00:26:50,444
You want the Outlaws to
pay you off? Sue us.

391
00:26:50,652 --> 00:26:52,085
Walk him to his car.

392
00:26:52,332 --> 00:26:54,641
l can kick myself out, thanks.

393
00:27:18,452 --> 00:27:20,443
Ten years' work, Grace.

394
00:27:20,652 --> 00:27:22,847
And we're this close.

395
00:27:25,732 --> 00:27:29,247
l think just a few members of the team
would have been enough.

396
00:27:29,492 --> 00:27:32,882
Having the Outlaws out here, full force,
is kind of crowding it.

397
00:27:33,132 --> 00:27:36,647
l have to get some use out of them.
l don't like football.

398
00:27:39,092 --> 00:27:40,127
Ben!

399
00:27:42,532 --> 00:27:43,521
We got troubles.

400
00:27:44,932 --> 00:27:46,285
Soames is here.

401
00:27:46,532 --> 00:27:49,444
He's brought a lot of those
Save The Mountain people.

402
00:27:49,652 --> 00:27:51,529
lt doesn't look good.

403
00:27:51,932 --> 00:27:53,968
Goddamn environmentalist bastards.

404
00:27:55,132 --> 00:27:58,522
l think you'd better handle this.
Come on, Ed.

405
00:27:58,732 --> 00:28:01,292
l can't believe he's doing
this to us.

406
00:28:01,692 --> 00:28:03,250
Good afternoon, Mrs. Wyler.

407
00:28:03,492 --> 00:28:05,847
l'm Bob Soames, County
Planning Commission.

408
00:28:06,052 --> 00:28:07,690
-But then you know that.
-Of course.

409
00:28:07,932 --> 00:28:09,251
lt's a pleasure to meet you.

410
00:28:09,492 --> 00:28:10,891
lt's been a long time coming.

411
00:28:11,132 --> 00:28:13,248
l brought friends.
l hope you don't mind.

412
00:28:13,492 --> 00:28:15,050
Not at all.

413
00:28:15,292 --> 00:28:17,806
Bob, are your friends
from the Sierra Club?

414
00:28:18,092 --> 00:28:20,242
Yes, as a matter of fact.
Quite a few.

415
00:28:20,452 --> 00:28:21,646
l hope they're welcome.

416
00:28:21,892 --> 00:28:23,291
l've supported them for years.

417
00:28:23,532 --> 00:28:25,090
Not only financially...

418
00:28:25,332 --> 00:28:27,721
...but also in my heart.

419
00:28:27,932 --> 00:28:29,490
Please join us.

420
00:28:30,012 --> 00:28:32,651
l really don't think so.

421
00:28:32,932 --> 00:28:34,445
Please.

422
00:28:37,012 --> 00:28:37,808
All right.

423
00:28:38,532 --> 00:28:40,204
Thank you.

424
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:43,285
l'm sorry, Ben. He promised me.

425
00:28:43,692 --> 00:28:46,252
Soames thinks he's a smart-ass.

426
00:28:46,732 --> 00:28:48,131
l'm not laughing.

427
00:28:48,452 --> 00:28:49,680
Cute little stores.

428
00:28:49,932 --> 00:28:53,004
''Zoning variances don't
count.'' l say, '' Come on--''

429
00:28:53,652 --> 00:28:55,290
What's it been, three weeks?

430
00:28:55,532 --> 00:28:57,841
Could you excuse me for
just a second?

431
00:28:59,292 --> 00:29:00,645
What are you doing here?

432
00:29:00,892 --> 00:29:01,847
Free eats, right?

433
00:29:03,412 --> 00:29:04,811
lt's Mrs. Wyler's party.

434
00:29:05,052 --> 00:29:06,849
-You don't wanna be here.
-That was bullshit...

435
00:29:07,092 --> 00:29:09,083
...in your office, wasn't it?

436
00:29:09,292 --> 00:29:11,089
You don't care about me.

437
00:29:12,252 --> 00:29:13,241
You work for Caxton.

438
00:29:14,612 --> 00:29:16,284
You wanted to play pro football.

439
00:29:16,532 --> 00:29:20,445
Every year, there's a chance
you'd lose your job because of injury.

440
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:23,843
You players never grasp, it
is not a very secure job.

441
00:29:24,092 --> 00:29:26,048
A lot of us made you
rich, didn't we?

442
00:29:28,212 --> 00:29:30,043
That's right, Brogan. l got rich.

443
00:29:30,252 --> 00:29:32,049
l'm getting richer all the time.

444
00:29:33,132 --> 00:29:34,201
That's good, Steve.

445
00:29:35,932 --> 00:29:36,842
Come on, come on.

446
00:29:38,652 --> 00:29:41,007
You can afford it
when l kick your teeth!

447
00:29:41,252 --> 00:29:43,243
Do it, see what happens!
You're a has-been!

448
00:29:45,212 --> 00:29:47,203
-Cool it, man.
-Come on, goddamn it!

449
00:29:48,732 --> 00:29:49,801
That's intelligent.

450
00:29:50,732 --> 00:29:53,200
Will you cool it?
You know Caxton's here.

451
00:29:53,412 --> 00:29:55,368
Hey, come on.

452
00:29:55,612 --> 00:29:56,488
Relax!

453
00:29:56,732 --> 00:29:58,882
You're finished in football!

454
00:29:59,092 --> 00:30:00,605
-Get him out!
-l'm out of here!

455
00:30:00,812 --> 00:30:03,645
-You're not playing this right.
-l could give a fuck.

456
00:30:03,852 --> 00:30:06,047
Wyler never mixed his
other businesses with the team.

457
00:30:06,252 --> 00:30:08,288
We played football.
We didn't sell real estate.

458
00:30:08,532 --> 00:30:10,648
You're saying l'm lucky
to be off the team?

459
00:30:10,852 --> 00:30:12,570
lt's a new goddamn ball game.

460
00:30:12,812 --> 00:30:15,451
That's all l'm telling you.
lt's all bullshit!

461
00:30:15,652 --> 00:30:18,291
l don't belong here either.
lt's a goddamn circus!

462
00:30:18,532 --> 00:30:20,523
l'm hearing weird things about you.

463
00:30:20,732 --> 00:30:21,528
Like what?

464
00:30:21,732 --> 00:30:23,848
Like you might go
to work for Jake Wise.

465
00:30:24,052 --> 00:30:25,041
He offered me a job.

466
00:30:25,252 --> 00:30:28,642
But you turned him down.
You're a smart kid. Wait!

467
00:30:28,892 --> 00:30:32,248
You're worried about money, but
don't screw around with Wise.

468
00:30:32,492 --> 00:30:34,562
l'm gonna get you a coaching job.

469
00:30:34,812 --> 00:30:35,881
Just for the year.

470
00:30:36,132 --> 00:30:38,441
l'm not ready to do
what you do. l'm a player!

471
00:30:38,692 --> 00:30:40,922
There's nothing here
for me now but shit!

472
00:30:41,132 --> 00:30:43,851
They won't pay me.
My shoulder's screwed up.

473
00:30:44,052 --> 00:30:45,405
Know what l'm telling myself?

474
00:30:46,852 --> 00:30:49,082
Take Wise's money.
Take a damn vacation!

475
00:30:49,332 --> 00:30:52,244
l'll find his rich girl for him
and lay in the sun.

476
00:30:52,452 --> 00:30:54,249
Have a good season, Hank.

477
00:30:56,092 --> 00:30:57,081
l'm on my own.

478
00:30:57,292 --> 00:30:59,647
Keep away from Wise, damn it!

479
00:32:06,012 --> 00:32:07,445
Jessie?

480
00:32:11,852 --> 00:32:13,046
l'm sorry.

481
00:32:13,852 --> 00:32:15,251
l'm sorry!

482
00:33:41,372 --> 00:33:42,851
Jessie?

483
00:33:47,612 --> 00:33:48,931
You're Jessie Wyler, aren't you?

484
00:33:49,612 --> 00:33:51,091
l'm Terry Brogan.

485
00:33:51,892 --> 00:33:53,689
l played ball for the Outlaws.

486
00:33:53,932 --> 00:33:55,684
The Outlaws don't interest me.

487
00:33:56,932 --> 00:33:58,843
l'm not playing this season.

488
00:34:01,212 --> 00:34:04,682
There's not much going on here.
Where can l go to have a good time?

489
00:34:04,932 --> 00:34:07,082
The ferry leaves every morning.

490
00:34:10,652 --> 00:34:12,688
Can l buy you a drink or something?

491
00:34:12,932 --> 00:34:15,048
How about a taco, huh?

492
00:34:19,132 --> 00:34:22,841
l guess you can have anybody do that
for you in L.A., huh?

493
00:34:23,052 --> 00:34:24,485
-What's that?
-A football player...

494
00:34:24,732 --> 00:34:27,041
...buy you a couple tacos and a beer.

495
00:34:29,052 --> 00:34:32,249
There are a lot better
things to do. Even in L.A.

496
00:34:34,532 --> 00:34:37,126
What don't you like?
Football players...

497
00:34:37,372 --> 00:34:39,249
...tacos or beer?

498
00:34:39,732 --> 00:34:42,166
l like tacos and l like beer.

499
00:34:45,212 --> 00:34:48,249
l should take the ferry, huh?

500
00:34:49,452 --> 00:34:52,250
l figure if l keep talking,
you won't disappear.

501
00:34:55,492 --> 00:34:56,402
Bye!

502
00:34:56,652 --> 00:34:57,846
You sure about that?

503
00:35:33,492 --> 00:35:35,642
Hey, Jake. How's it going?

504
00:35:36,932 --> 00:35:38,650
No, nothing yet.

505
00:35:41,812 --> 00:35:45,441
l didn't expect to have signs
telling me where she is.

506
00:35:47,892 --> 00:35:50,281
Maybe l'll be outside
having a drink...

507
00:35:50,532 --> 00:35:54,241
...l'll look and out of nowhere
she'll be buying some fruit.

508
00:35:54,732 --> 00:35:56,404
l'll call you in a few days.

509
00:35:57,892 --> 00:36:01,441
All right.
See you. Bye.

510
00:36:06,612 --> 00:36:08,568
Pretty slick, Roberto.

511
00:36:09,692 --> 00:36:12,650
Okay, senor. Cerveza, no glass.

512
00:36:13,332 --> 00:36:15,448
l've been hanging out here a lot, huh?

513
00:36:17,892 --> 00:36:19,848
Some hangout.

514
00:36:47,092 --> 00:36:48,241
Damn it!

515
00:36:57,212 --> 00:36:58,850
Where's that boat going?

516
00:36:59,052 --> 00:37:00,246
Tulum.

517
00:37:00,452 --> 00:37:02,443
-When's the next ferry?
-Six hours.

518
00:37:02,692 --> 00:37:03,488
Shit!

519
00:38:04,852 --> 00:38:06,843
Should l be afraid of you?

520
00:38:08,852 --> 00:38:10,251
l don't know.

521
00:38:14,332 --> 00:38:15,606
lt's beautiful, huh?

522
00:38:15,932 --> 00:38:18,605
lf this were L.A., my stepfather
would've bought it.

523
00:38:18,852 --> 00:38:21,241
Torn it up and built condominiums.

524
00:38:22,332 --> 00:38:26,041
Here, the land intimidates them.
They leave it in peace.

525
00:38:26,532 --> 00:38:28,045
Some spot.

526
00:38:29,212 --> 00:38:32,284
lt's nothing like the great
Maya cities of the Yucatan.

527
00:38:32,532 --> 00:38:33,647
Chichen ltza.

528
00:38:33,892 --> 00:38:35,723
Should have hidden there.

529
00:38:35,972 --> 00:38:38,042
ls that what you're doing?
Hiding?

530
00:38:38,532 --> 00:38:39,851
Yep.

531
00:38:43,892 --> 00:38:45,405
From you, right?

532
00:38:46,892 --> 00:38:48,405
What do you mean?

533
00:38:50,212 --> 00:38:52,009
Jake sent you.

534
00:38:56,172 --> 00:38:57,810
Maybe your mother did.

535
00:38:58,252 --> 00:39:01,608
l wouldn't know which one
had more to threaten you with.

536
00:39:04,252 --> 00:39:06,004
You wanna know the truth?

537
00:39:06,212 --> 00:39:07,531
l came for the hell of it.

538
00:39:08,452 --> 00:39:12,604
l wanted to get out of L.A.
A Caribbean island didn't sound too bad.

539
00:39:13,452 --> 00:39:16,205
Only trouble is, now l'm here
l find myself...

540
00:39:16,452 --> 00:39:19,250
...in the middle of something
l've no feeling for.

541
00:39:20,412 --> 00:39:22,801
Well, you're not doing this for free.

542
00:39:23,052 --> 00:39:25,441
You're getting paid well,
aren't you?

543
00:39:27,692 --> 00:39:29,444
Which one are you working for?

544
00:39:30,612 --> 00:39:32,330
Which one knows you found me?

545
00:39:32,692 --> 00:39:34,728
Nobody knows anything, okay?

546
00:39:35,012 --> 00:39:36,047
Oh, sure!

547
00:39:36,292 --> 00:39:38,726
l figure, fuck them. You know?

548
00:39:39,572 --> 00:39:41,608
Fuck you too, lady.

549
00:39:43,452 --> 00:39:45,682
l loved your drawing.

550
00:40:27,772 --> 00:40:28,841
l wanna talk to you.

551
00:40:30,652 --> 00:40:31,767
Talk.

552
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:35,402
Why should l believe
you won't tell Jake where l am?

553
00:40:36,612 --> 00:40:40,048
There are people who care what you
believe. l don't see them here.

554
00:40:45,172 --> 00:40:47,891
l have a broken shoulder,
both my knees are shot...

555
00:40:48,132 --> 00:40:49,531
...guys are crippling themselves...

556
00:40:49,772 --> 00:40:53,401
...so you can act like a
1 3-year-old runaway from Bel Air.

557
00:40:53,652 --> 00:40:55,608
l could give a shit what you believe.

558
00:41:02,292 --> 00:41:04,203
-How's Sam?
-Who?

559
00:41:04,412 --> 00:41:05,640
My dog.

560
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:08,083
l don't know.
Looks like he's fed.

561
00:41:11,692 --> 00:41:13,648
l shouldn't be afraid of you.

562
00:41:16,692 --> 00:41:17,568
When you leaving?

563
00:41:18,492 --> 00:41:21,962
l think 4:00.
l wish it were sooner.

564
00:41:23,892 --> 00:41:26,247
Never found where l live, did you?

565
00:41:29,292 --> 00:41:31,806
l don't think anybody could.

566
00:41:32,012 --> 00:41:34,810
lt's the prettiest place
on the island.

567
00:41:35,892 --> 00:41:38,008
Don't leave without saying goodbye.

568
00:41:41,172 --> 00:41:44,721
You take the highway out of town
to kilometre 1 9.

569
00:41:44,972 --> 00:41:47,042
When you see the three Tecate cans...

570
00:41:47,292 --> 00:41:50,011
... it's the first dirt road
on the right.

571
00:41:56,892 --> 00:41:59,008
Don't leave without saying goodbye.

572
00:42:01,972 --> 00:42:04,008
Don't leave without saying goodbye.

573
00:42:19,852 --> 00:42:22,650
You don't have to worry about
the neighbors.

574
00:42:22,892 --> 00:42:25,804
They were building homes here
when a storm hit.

575
00:42:26,052 --> 00:42:28,202
They all fell down except this one.

576
00:42:28,692 --> 00:42:30,410
Waited for you, huh?

577
00:42:34,412 --> 00:42:35,845
Like a drink?

578
00:42:36,092 --> 00:42:37,810
All right. That'd be great.

579
00:42:45,092 --> 00:42:48,209
-Tequila okay?
-That's great.

580
00:42:50,212 --> 00:42:51,725
lt's Maya.

581
00:42:52,292 --> 00:42:54,089
Third century, l think.

582
00:42:59,852 --> 00:43:00,807
No ice.

583
00:43:01,052 --> 00:43:02,405
That's all right.

584
00:43:02,692 --> 00:43:05,001
You don't have any electricity here?

585
00:43:07,172 --> 00:43:08,605
Propane.

586
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:18,451
How'd you end up with Jake?

587
00:43:18,972 --> 00:43:20,803
The Palace, l guess.

588
00:43:23,572 --> 00:43:26,006
l wanted to be a
rock 'n' roll singer.

589
00:43:27,372 --> 00:43:31,206
Jake convinced me that rich girls
don't have the soul for it.

590
00:43:32,172 --> 00:43:35,721
Sounds like Jake. Always convincing
somebody of something.

591
00:43:36,892 --> 00:43:40,771
lt seems l have the soul to
live with him, be his girlfriend.

592
00:43:41,092 --> 00:43:43,447
He never had anybody
like you before.

593
00:43:48,052 --> 00:43:51,203
You're a whole different class
for him.

594
00:43:52,692 --> 00:43:54,045
Not really.

595
00:43:54,292 --> 00:43:57,807
My family didn't get to own most
of Bel Air by being honest.

596
00:43:58,692 --> 00:44:00,603
Jake always thought l was his luck.

597
00:44:00,852 --> 00:44:03,127
l helped him outthink people
like my family.

598
00:44:03,372 --> 00:44:06,409
l know why he wanted you.

599
00:44:06,612 --> 00:44:08,204
But why were you with him?

600
00:44:09,692 --> 00:44:13,207
l liked that my being with him
made a lot of people crazy.

601
00:44:14,772 --> 00:44:16,410
Like your mom?

602
00:44:18,252 --> 00:44:19,731
lt even frightened her.

603
00:44:19,972 --> 00:44:23,009
And that was really something to
finally pull off.

604
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:29,007
lf only my brother had done
that and not by killing himself.

605
00:44:32,372 --> 00:44:34,249
Your brother killed himself?

606
00:44:34,892 --> 00:44:36,405
l guess.

607
00:44:38,692 --> 00:44:41,809
He got into drugs
for the same reason l did.

608
00:44:42,052 --> 00:44:44,612
To get away from our terrible life.

609
00:44:46,052 --> 00:44:47,610
Did his dying make you stop?

610
00:44:52,412 --> 00:44:53,527
Jake did.

611
00:44:53,972 --> 00:44:55,121
Jake did?

612
00:44:57,172 --> 00:45:01,404
After l was with him awhile, it became
very important to him that l stop.

613
00:45:01,612 --> 00:45:04,080
Wouldn't leave me
alone until l quit.

614
00:45:04,332 --> 00:45:06,800
The truth is l wanted to quit.

615
00:45:09,892 --> 00:45:12,281
When l did, l didn't need
Jake anymore.

616
00:45:13,012 --> 00:45:14,764
Bet that kind of threw him.

617
00:45:19,572 --> 00:45:22,848
He said the only way l could
get away was to kill him.

618
00:45:24,892 --> 00:45:26,610
Well, you almost did.

619
00:45:29,172 --> 00:45:30,810
Not really.

620
00:45:32,252 --> 00:45:34,402
l'm gonna stay away from Jake.

621
00:45:35,372 --> 00:45:36,521
And my mother.

622
00:45:37,692 --> 00:45:39,205
Good.

623
00:45:47,212 --> 00:45:48,565
l ought to get going.

624
00:45:51,492 --> 00:45:52,811
Why?

625
00:45:56,052 --> 00:45:57,804
What'd you come here for?

626
00:47:41,012 --> 00:47:44,527
You know, this is the best
l've felt in years.

627
00:47:44,772 --> 00:47:47,127
l think you're incredible.

628
00:47:47,332 --> 00:47:49,004
You do?

629
00:47:50,292 --> 00:47:52,328
Yes, l do.

630
00:48:06,372 --> 00:48:09,409
There's a great canyon.
Let's go back down there.

631
00:48:09,652 --> 00:48:11,005
Don't you ever have to breathe?

632
00:48:11,212 --> 00:48:13,043
lt's good therapy for my shoulder.

633
00:48:29,452 --> 00:48:30,805
This is a dream, you know?

634
00:48:31,052 --> 00:48:34,203
lt's true! l've completely
forgotten about football.

635
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:35,401
You liar!

636
00:48:35,652 --> 00:48:38,007
That's the first thing you've said
l don't believe.

637
00:48:38,212 --> 00:48:40,806
Come here! lt's true!

638
00:48:41,012 --> 00:48:42,445
Then come in and prove it!

639
00:48:42,692 --> 00:48:44,091
l'm not coming in there!

640
00:48:48,492 --> 00:48:52,451
Come on, guapo. lt's good therapy
for your shoulder.

641
00:49:03,252 --> 00:49:06,608
You know, l thought Jake would
send someone awful.

642
00:49:06,812 --> 00:49:10,441
How do you know l'm not awful?
Maybe l'm no different than Jake.

643
00:49:14,452 --> 00:49:18,001
We haven't left each other's side
for the last two weeks.

644
00:49:20,172 --> 00:49:23,403
l figure l know who you are,
Terry Brogan.

645
00:49:38,172 --> 00:49:39,605
When l got my contract...

646
00:49:39,852 --> 00:49:42,730
...it was the first real money
l ever had.

647
00:49:42,972 --> 00:49:45,327
My lawyer took a big hunk
out of it.

648
00:49:45,572 --> 00:49:48,006
But still, l bought
everything in sight.

649
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:51,928
And the girl that l was
living with at the time...

650
00:49:52,172 --> 00:49:56,211
...she moved out on me.
Took all my furniture with her.

651
00:49:57,772 --> 00:50:01,287
lt seems funny now, but
at the time it flipped me out.

652
00:50:02,572 --> 00:50:06,406
l was under a lot of pressure,
trying to make the starting lineup.

653
00:50:08,252 --> 00:50:11,324
l started acting crazy,
hanging out with Jake.

654
00:50:11,572 --> 00:50:15,201
We got along great.
He was as crazy as l was.

655
00:50:17,812 --> 00:50:20,724
And after a couple of years,
l got my ass into debt.

656
00:50:20,972 --> 00:50:23,202
l mean, really badly.

657
00:50:25,092 --> 00:50:27,652
And l made a deal with him
to shave points.

658
00:50:34,292 --> 00:50:37,602
You don't have to
tell me this, okay?

659
00:50:38,692 --> 00:50:40,250
l'm supposed to stop now?

660
00:50:40,492 --> 00:50:43,802
You said you know me.
Well, you don't. l want you to.

661
00:50:50,652 --> 00:50:52,643
lt was a game during the playoffs.

662
00:50:52,852 --> 00:50:55,810
We were expected to win by a
four-point spread.

663
00:50:57,492 --> 00:51:00,450
l was supposed to see we didn't
win by so much.

664
00:51:01,492 --> 00:51:03,801
l kept putting it off
because l felt good.

665
00:51:04,012 --> 00:51:06,401
You know, blow the other team out.

666
00:51:07,412 --> 00:51:11,644
ln the fourth quarter, they scored
1 4 points. Everything was great.

667
00:51:11,852 --> 00:51:13,843
The spread was 4.
We were ahead by 3.

668
00:51:14,092 --> 00:51:15,810
l didn't have to do anything.

669
00:51:17,092 --> 00:51:19,048
Then the quarterback...

670
00:51:19,252 --> 00:51:21,402
...he threw this pass.

671
00:51:22,852 --> 00:51:24,490
Put it right into my hands.

672
00:51:25,452 --> 00:51:28,171
lt was just so perfect l just
had to catch it.

673
00:51:29,692 --> 00:51:33,401
All l had to do was just
drop the fucker.

674
00:51:33,652 --> 00:51:36,610
But my reflexes took over.

675
00:51:38,772 --> 00:51:42,208
So their guy tackled me on the five...

676
00:51:43,292 --> 00:51:45,203
...and l fumbled.

677
00:51:47,492 --> 00:51:50,370
l just made my hands let go
of the ball.

678
00:51:56,212 --> 00:51:58,601
lt scared the shit out of me.

679
00:51:58,812 --> 00:52:01,610
l thought everybody in the
stadium, all 55,000...

680
00:52:01,812 --> 00:52:04,007
...knew l was a son of a bitch.

681
00:52:08,092 --> 00:52:10,128
So you won by three instead
of four points.

682
00:52:10,372 --> 00:52:13,603
lf another player
would have done that...

683
00:52:13,812 --> 00:52:16,610
...you'd have to pull me off
quick, or he'd be dead.

684
00:52:20,172 --> 00:52:22,606
lt's still torturing you, isn't it?

685
00:52:24,412 --> 00:52:27,006
See, l do know who you are.

686
00:52:31,492 --> 00:52:33,801
Do you know what l wish?

687
00:52:37,892 --> 00:52:41,407
l wish l'd seen you play football.

688
00:52:43,372 --> 00:52:45,806
l bet you were wonderful.

689
00:52:47,452 --> 00:52:49,010
God!

690
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:53,602
l can see how Jake would
go crazy without you.

691
00:53:37,612 --> 00:53:39,409
All from Jake.

692
00:53:42,252 --> 00:53:44,402
They stopped coming in four days ago.

693
00:53:45,492 --> 00:53:47,403
We should leave here, you know.

694
00:53:48,492 --> 00:53:51,211
Terry, l don't want to leave.

695
00:53:52,252 --> 00:53:54,004
lt's so perfect here.

696
00:53:54,452 --> 00:53:56,010
Yeah, l know.

697
00:53:56,252 --> 00:53:58,004
We have no choice, though.

698
00:54:00,652 --> 00:54:02,449
l don't have much money left.

699
00:54:02,692 --> 00:54:04,967
Can't draw from my trust
for three months.

700
00:54:07,172 --> 00:54:08,446
Jake's money's all gone?

701
00:54:10,892 --> 00:54:12,803
What do you mean, Jake's money?

702
00:54:15,052 --> 00:54:17,327
He said you took 50 grand from him.

703
00:54:17,572 --> 00:54:19,528
Steal from him,
when l want him off me?

704
00:54:19,772 --> 00:54:21,808
l'd be out of my mind.

705
00:54:26,052 --> 00:54:28,612
l didn't get a cent
of his goddamn money.

706
00:54:33,612 --> 00:54:36,809
Well, l've got the money
he gave me so....

707
00:54:37,052 --> 00:54:39,930
l'll go to the hotel
in the morning and get my bags.

708
00:54:40,172 --> 00:54:41,969
We'll cover our tracks, huh?

709
00:54:42,212 --> 00:54:45,204
But you have to go to
Chichen ltza alone, okay?

710
00:54:45,452 --> 00:54:48,205
l gotta get Jake off our trail.

711
00:55:23,412 --> 00:55:25,801
God, where have you been, Terry?

712
00:55:26,292 --> 00:55:27,930
l've had 1 0 days in this place.

713
00:55:28,172 --> 00:55:30,208
l found a guy to
get us a house in Oaxaca.

714
00:55:30,412 --> 00:55:32,642
-Anywhere but here.
-l hope he's for real.

715
00:55:32,892 --> 00:55:34,450
lt'll cost all l've got.

716
00:55:34,852 --> 00:55:37,605
-You don't know what it's like.
-Where are we going?

717
00:55:42,012 --> 00:55:44,651
-People can see us.
-lf they can, who cares?

718
00:55:44,892 --> 00:55:47,611
Jess, come on.
Will you cool it?

719
00:55:48,452 --> 00:55:50,124
You know we had to separate.

720
00:55:50,372 --> 00:55:53,045
Jake thinks l'm all over
the place looking for you.

721
00:55:53,292 --> 00:55:56,409
l've been to Mexico City,
Cuernavaca, Taxco.

722
00:55:58,172 --> 00:56:01,209
l wired Jake. He thinks
you're in Campeche.

723
00:56:18,972 --> 00:56:22,408
l wonder when was the last time
someone used this court?

724
00:56:23,692 --> 00:56:26,411
Fourteen or fifteen centuries ago,
maybe.

725
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:32,044
The games here must've been
incredible. Look at this.

726
00:56:32,572 --> 00:56:35,484
They even wore facemasks
and shoulder pads.

727
00:56:37,492 --> 00:56:40,802
Games were a little more serious
than the ones you play.

728
00:56:42,212 --> 00:56:46,410
They'd play for days. The team that
lost got their heads chopped off.

729
00:56:47,772 --> 00:56:49,683
And the guys who bet on the game...

730
00:56:49,932 --> 00:56:52,207
...wagered themselves,
even their children.

731
00:56:52,412 --> 00:56:54,528
And if they lost, they were slaves.

732
00:56:55,572 --> 00:56:58,006
You're going crazy here, aren't you?

733
00:56:59,692 --> 00:57:02,160
l think l'd be crazy if l weren't.

734
00:57:04,452 --> 00:57:05,805
We're getting out.

735
00:57:06,012 --> 00:57:07,445
To go where?

736
00:57:07,692 --> 00:57:10,206
Another place we don't belong?

737
00:57:10,612 --> 00:57:12,409
We could do better.

738
00:57:15,052 --> 00:57:16,405
With what?

739
00:57:18,292 --> 00:57:22,251
l don't have the money Jake
and your mother have, but so what?

740
00:57:22,492 --> 00:57:24,608
l'm taking care of you, aren't l?

741
00:57:25,052 --> 00:57:27,043
There's money in Mexico City.

742
00:57:27,292 --> 00:57:28,202
What? Whose money?

743
00:57:28,572 --> 00:57:29,607
Mine.

744
00:57:30,972 --> 00:57:32,200
Yours?

745
00:57:33,372 --> 00:57:34,805
Jake's.

746
00:57:35,492 --> 00:57:38,723
-Why didn't you tell me?
-l couldn't trust you for sure.

747
00:57:38,972 --> 00:57:41,202
Since when couldn't you trust me?

748
00:57:41,412 --> 00:57:43,243
-ln the beginning.
-What beginning?

749
00:57:43,452 --> 00:57:45,408
We've been in it
since we saw each other.

750
00:57:45,652 --> 00:57:48,405
Tell me! When did you
start trusting me?

751
00:57:48,652 --> 00:57:51,610
lt was a risk to trust you,
all right?

752
00:57:52,492 --> 00:57:53,845
l never saw it that way.

753
00:57:54,092 --> 00:57:57,050
l took the risk by letting
you come with me.

754
00:57:57,292 --> 00:57:58,520
You let me come with you?

755
00:57:58,772 --> 00:58:01,206
lt would've been
different if l were alone.

756
00:58:02,052 --> 00:58:04,805
Do you think l'm caging
you in or something?

757
00:58:05,052 --> 00:58:06,804
Well, it's true, isn't it?

758
00:58:07,452 --> 00:58:11,604
l'm standing in your way of freedom?
Keeping you from your money--?

759
00:58:11,852 --> 00:58:13,046
You're twisting what l say.

760
00:58:13,292 --> 00:58:15,442
Jesus, l love you!

761
00:58:15,692 --> 00:58:17,842
You've become everything l'm about!

762
00:58:18,092 --> 00:58:20,652
Can't anyone love me
without it being...

763
00:58:20,892 --> 00:58:22,848
...life or death to them?

764
00:58:25,452 --> 00:58:29,411
Most people are afraid they're
never going to be loved like that.

765
00:58:32,612 --> 00:58:33,965
Terry, wait!

766
00:58:36,612 --> 00:58:41,049
l've lied and used people all my life
because l thought everybody did.

767
00:58:41,292 --> 00:58:44,443
Everyone except my brother, and look
where it got him.

768
00:58:47,092 --> 00:58:49,811
lt's just so hard for me
to trust anyone.

769
00:58:50,092 --> 00:58:51,127
l'm not anyone.

770
00:58:52,012 --> 00:58:53,411
l know.

771
00:58:53,612 --> 00:58:56,046
l know you're not, and l'm trying.

772
00:58:56,292 --> 00:58:57,850
l want to trust you.

773
00:58:58,092 --> 00:59:00,208
God, l love you!

774
00:59:01,692 --> 00:59:03,410
l love you.

775
00:59:14,372 --> 00:59:16,602
Come on. The park's closing.

776
00:59:18,092 --> 00:59:19,810
Let's go to the sweathouse.

777
01:00:30,492 --> 01:00:31,845
There's somebody in here.

778
01:00:32,092 --> 01:00:34,242
-Where?
-There's somebody there.

779
01:00:38,812 --> 01:00:39,608
Sully!

780
01:00:40,652 --> 01:00:42,961
-What the fuck--?
-Sorry l walked in on you.

781
01:00:43,212 --> 01:00:44,327
Walked in on me?

782
01:00:45,652 --> 01:00:47,563
What the hell are you doing here?

783
01:00:48,292 --> 01:00:49,805
What am l doing here?

784
01:00:50,052 --> 01:00:52,043
What are we doing here?

785
01:00:52,292 --> 01:00:54,248
You're in a lot of trouble.
l came to...

786
01:00:54,492 --> 01:00:56,050
...talk some sense into you.

787
01:00:56,292 --> 01:00:57,805
You came here to talk to me?

788
01:01:01,572 --> 01:01:03,688
lf a tired old guy like
me can find you....

789
01:01:05,572 --> 01:01:07,369
What are you talking about?

790
01:01:12,172 --> 01:01:13,810
Who is he, Terry?

791
01:01:15,212 --> 01:01:17,601
Hank Sully. He's with the Outlaws.

792
01:01:18,532 --> 01:01:19,328
Jake sent him.

793
01:01:22,772 --> 01:01:23,602
That's crazy.

794
01:01:23,812 --> 01:01:26,406
l know his name!
He called Jake at the house.

795
01:01:30,372 --> 01:01:31,691
Talk to me, Sul.

796
01:01:32,212 --> 01:01:35,010
Why did you leave the team
in the middle of the season?

797
01:01:36,572 --> 01:01:37,687
Come on, talk!

798
01:01:38,492 --> 01:01:39,891
What do you want from me?

799
01:01:41,892 --> 01:01:45,805
That jackass Caxton and her
old lady screwing up the team.

800
01:01:47,212 --> 01:01:50,488
You know, if Mr. Wyler were
alive, l'd be head coach.

801
01:01:53,412 --> 01:01:54,970
l think about that a lot.

802
01:01:58,252 --> 01:02:00,402
So l just figured, fuck it!

803
01:02:01,612 --> 01:02:03,762
l'd do something for me
for a change.

804
01:02:04,572 --> 01:02:07,962
l was close to you guys. l knew
who was in debt, and how deep.

805
01:02:08,212 --> 01:02:11,010
So when Jake wanted...

806
01:02:11,212 --> 01:02:14,249
...l could always finger
who was ready to break.

807
01:02:17,092 --> 01:02:20,368
You're going home from here with
nothing. You know that.

808
01:02:22,172 --> 01:02:25,289
Wise will send someone
a lot tougher than me.

809
01:02:26,652 --> 01:02:27,448
Hank, come on.

810
01:02:27,692 --> 01:02:29,808
Man, this is crazy.

811
01:02:32,572 --> 01:02:34,961
-How much trouble are you in?
-Enough!

812
01:02:36,772 --> 01:02:38,171
l'm sorry.

813
01:02:42,052 --> 01:02:43,405
Hold it!

814
01:02:50,492 --> 01:02:52,050
You're old and tired...

815
01:02:52,292 --> 01:02:54,681
...you're not out of your mind too?

816
01:02:57,172 --> 01:03:00,005
Hank, come on.
This is Terry, man!

817
01:03:00,212 --> 01:03:02,362
You don't know him, Terry!

818
01:03:03,212 --> 01:03:05,203
Just let me take her back with me.

819
01:03:05,452 --> 01:03:08,410
Who's gonna hurt her? Wise?
He worships her.

820
01:03:08,652 --> 01:03:09,801
Back off, Sully!

821
01:03:12,452 --> 01:03:14,124
Goddamn you, Terry!

822
01:03:14,372 --> 01:03:15,646
She's worthless!

823
01:03:37,092 --> 01:03:38,366
Come on, Terry.

824
01:03:38,572 --> 01:03:40,608
You're no good at this.

825
01:03:42,572 --> 01:03:45,609
lt was easy to find you.
Mexico City, Cuernavaca.

826
01:03:45,812 --> 01:03:48,485
l was breathing down your neck
and you didn't know it.

827
01:03:48,732 --> 01:03:51,200
Come on, Terry.
l'm taking her back!

828
01:03:57,812 --> 01:03:59,609
Son of a bitch!

829
01:04:03,692 --> 01:04:05,011
Damn it, Sully!

830
01:04:05,652 --> 01:04:07,370
Go on and get it, Terry!

831
01:04:12,852 --> 01:04:14,205
Stop it!

832
01:04:15,612 --> 01:04:17,204
Get off him!

833
01:04:29,852 --> 01:04:31,080
You jackass!

834
01:04:39,572 --> 01:04:40,482
Stop!

835
01:04:41,772 --> 01:04:43,205
-Come on, Terry.
-Okay, stop.

836
01:04:44,572 --> 01:04:45,527
Shut the fuck up!

837
01:04:45,772 --> 01:04:46,807
Back off, Sully.

838
01:04:47,052 --> 01:04:47,928
Get away, please!

839
01:04:48,772 --> 01:04:50,603
See what you've done?

840
01:04:51,372 --> 01:04:53,010
Give me that fucking gun.

841
01:04:57,612 --> 01:04:58,806
He grabbed the gun.

842
01:04:59,052 --> 01:05:00,724
l couldn't help it.

843
01:05:00,972 --> 01:05:02,325
Let's get out of here.

844
01:05:03,012 --> 01:05:03,808
He's not dead!

845
01:05:04,052 --> 01:05:05,121
He will be, Terry.

846
01:05:05,652 --> 01:05:07,165
There's no one to help him.

847
01:05:07,372 --> 01:05:08,600
She's right.

848
01:05:10,012 --> 01:05:12,207
Maybe l'll stop bleeding.
What do you think?

849
01:05:12,452 --> 01:05:14,408
Sure. Sure.

850
01:05:15,892 --> 01:05:18,201
You're full of shit, Brogan.

851
01:05:20,092 --> 01:05:22,242
-We gotta do something--
-Do what?

852
01:05:22,492 --> 01:05:25,165
Take him to a Mexican jail?
Are you crazy?

853
01:05:25,412 --> 01:05:27,164
lt's not our fault.
We can explain!

854
01:05:27,412 --> 01:05:30,961
We can't, Terry! Let's just get out!
Let's go. Let's run!

855
01:05:31,212 --> 01:05:33,168
This isn't something
we can run from!

856
01:05:33,412 --> 01:05:35,642
Oh, God! You're so innocent!

857
01:05:36,412 --> 01:05:39,210
You just don't understand! Do you?

858
01:05:41,212 --> 01:05:44,204
Come on, Sul, hang in there.

859
01:05:44,412 --> 01:05:45,561
Bury me here, Brogan.

860
01:05:45,812 --> 01:05:48,406
Forget that shit, will you?

861
01:05:49,812 --> 01:05:53,009
What are we doing down here?

862
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:45,008
Oh, God. Jess, no!

863
01:07:57,812 --> 01:07:59,165
La senorita!

864
01:08:42,972 --> 01:08:44,371
Give it to me.

865
01:08:44,612 --> 01:08:46,603
All right, l'm not spiking.

866
01:08:49,452 --> 01:08:51,807
Nice. You playing with
your high heels on?

867
01:08:52,972 --> 01:08:53,768
lmpressive!

868
01:08:55,772 --> 01:09:00,368
Now see, if l like a guy and it looks
like l'll never see him again...

869
01:09:00,612 --> 01:09:02,648
...l don't worry. You know why?

870
01:09:03,572 --> 01:09:06,609
Because l always get lucky.
Thanks, honey.

871
01:09:07,092 --> 01:09:09,003
You're working up a sweat.
That's good.

872
01:09:09,212 --> 01:09:10,531
l love sports, Terry.

873
01:09:11,692 --> 01:09:13,011
You know that.

874
01:09:16,172 --> 01:09:17,844
An Outlaws game is starting.

875
01:09:18,092 --> 01:09:21,209
Tommy, head into town. Call me
after the games, okay?

876
01:09:23,172 --> 01:09:26,209
So did you notice?
l'm walking without a limp.

877
01:09:26,412 --> 01:09:29,961
You got your life together, Jake.
l'm impressed.

878
01:09:31,212 --> 01:09:34,921
You know, Ter, there's
never just one game.

879
01:09:35,172 --> 01:09:37,242
There's always a whole
mess of them.

880
01:09:37,492 --> 01:09:39,084
Like life.

881
01:09:40,292 --> 01:09:42,010
You get hit hard by one...

882
01:09:42,412 --> 01:09:45,006
...you get blessed
by a couple of others.

883
01:09:46,612 --> 01:09:47,965
You still like football?

884
01:09:50,092 --> 01:09:52,208
l love the game, myself.

885
01:09:52,452 --> 01:09:53,601
Business and pleasure.

886
01:09:55,972 --> 01:09:57,530
You got a new conditioning coach.

887
01:09:58,772 --> 01:10:00,171
Did you know that?

888
01:10:00,372 --> 01:10:02,602
Sully's gone.

889
01:10:04,892 --> 01:10:06,803
When are you going to tell me?

890
01:10:07,052 --> 01:10:08,610
What happened down there?

891
01:10:10,692 --> 01:10:12,410
l decided it was a shit job.

892
01:10:12,652 --> 01:10:14,165
So you just walked away?

893
01:10:15,452 --> 01:10:16,601
You still looking for her?

894
01:10:18,652 --> 01:10:19,801
Didn't you find her yet?

895
01:10:20,052 --> 01:10:21,804
lt's none of your business.

896
01:10:22,052 --> 01:10:25,601
You didn't finish the job, so l
don't owe you the money.

897
01:10:25,852 --> 01:10:29,242
l figure you just came over to
say we're still friends.

898
01:10:29,492 --> 01:10:30,447
Tell me l'm right?

899
01:10:32,372 --> 01:10:34,408
l just wanted to tell you to eat it.

900
01:10:35,852 --> 01:10:36,841
That's nice.

901
01:10:37,092 --> 01:10:40,482
You have something on me?
You hang me, you hang yourself.

902
01:10:42,052 --> 01:10:43,770
Go to hell.

903
01:10:44,772 --> 01:10:47,570
lt's not that easy, Terry.
There's others involved.

904
01:10:47,812 --> 01:10:49,211
lt's just not you and me.

905
01:10:50,492 --> 01:10:52,130
lf you want to play football...

906
01:10:52,692 --> 01:10:54,648
...there's something you gotta do.

907
01:10:55,292 --> 01:10:56,611
Another job.

908
01:10:56,852 --> 01:10:58,251
lt's gonna help both of us.

909
01:10:58,492 --> 01:11:01,086
You didn't hear me, did you?
lt's finished with us.

910
01:11:01,332 --> 01:11:05,007
Don't you feel you owe me
a little something?

911
01:11:15,412 --> 01:11:17,289
She look great, or what?

912
01:11:20,572 --> 01:11:22,722
Christ, would you look
at that defense?

913
01:11:23,572 --> 01:11:26,166
The whole team's out
of shape without Sully.

914
01:11:27,452 --> 01:11:30,524
Sully is missed.
l can tell you that.

915
01:11:34,452 --> 01:11:37,330
Don't leave. Stay and watch
the game, man.

916
01:11:37,572 --> 01:11:39,244
lf you want...

917
01:11:39,492 --> 01:11:41,005
...you can even place a bet.

918
01:11:41,652 --> 01:11:43,165
Some other time.

919
01:11:43,412 --> 01:11:46,210
There's a party at the Palace
tomorrow night.

920
01:11:46,412 --> 01:11:48,164
You'll hear some good music.

921
01:11:48,412 --> 01:11:50,448
And l'll tell you all about that job.

922
01:11:50,692 --> 01:11:52,808
This is something you've got to do.

923
01:11:53,052 --> 01:11:55,805
Because your career's all
you got now, my friend.

924
01:11:56,652 --> 01:11:58,005
So l'll expect you, right?

925
01:12:06,612 --> 01:12:09,331
Hey, get out of there!
Get out!

926
01:12:09,572 --> 01:12:11,403
Get out of there!

927
01:12:13,692 --> 01:12:15,205
Have you been all right?

928
01:12:16,052 --> 01:12:19,010
Wait till l get my wind back.
Get your dog out.

929
01:12:19,892 --> 01:12:21,610
Come on, Sam.

930
01:12:22,892 --> 01:12:23,768
l think about you.

931
01:12:24,012 --> 01:12:26,003
l think about you too, lady.

932
01:12:26,252 --> 01:12:28,004
Let's leave it at that, huh?

933
01:12:28,252 --> 01:12:29,526
Understand who l am.

934
01:12:29,772 --> 01:12:32,650
Someone's always been
there to take care of things.

935
01:12:32,892 --> 01:12:35,452
You weren't able to handle
Sully. l had to come back.

936
01:12:36,252 --> 01:12:40,040
lt was either Jake or my mother.
And l couldn't go to her.

937
01:12:41,012 --> 01:12:42,764
Terry, he knows about Sully.

938
01:12:43,892 --> 01:12:46,406
What's he know?
What did you tell him?

939
01:12:47,052 --> 01:12:48,724
Terry, he could hurt us.

940
01:12:49,052 --> 01:12:50,804
You mean he could hurt me.

941
01:12:52,172 --> 01:12:54,128
Do what he wants
and finish it with him.

942
01:12:54,772 --> 01:12:56,649
Are you scared for me, Jess?

943
01:12:59,892 --> 01:13:02,645
You know, l've been down
there looking for you.

944
01:13:02,892 --> 01:13:06,407
l came back hoping somebody might
know something. l was worried.

945
01:13:08,372 --> 01:13:10,124
You came back to this fuck.

946
01:13:11,772 --> 01:13:12,966
l love you.

947
01:13:13,212 --> 01:13:15,009
Oh, yeah, l noticed.

948
01:13:36,092 --> 01:13:37,810
Todd, how you doing?

949
01:13:38,012 --> 01:13:39,923
Let's go upstairs and talk some
football.

950
01:13:40,172 --> 01:13:43,369
-You're here to watch the show.
-Catch me when l'm in the mood.

951
01:13:44,252 --> 01:13:45,651
Hang out at the bar.

952
01:13:45,852 --> 01:13:48,241
You want to talk, maybe
Tommy will listen.

953
01:13:48,492 --> 01:13:52,610
He never writes anything down.
l don't even know if he can write.

954
01:13:53,172 --> 01:13:54,048
l don't trust--

955
01:13:54,252 --> 01:13:58,245
Watch you mouth when you
talk about Tommy. Do you hear me?

956
01:13:58,492 --> 01:14:02,405
Now if not, okay, go play your
money someplace else. Go on.

957
01:14:07,292 --> 01:14:08,407
l'll be in the bar.

958
01:14:08,652 --> 01:14:09,721
He'll be at the bar.

959
01:14:11,132 --> 01:14:13,407
How are you?
Nice to see you.

960
01:14:13,972 --> 01:14:16,042
Glad you showed up.
That's nice.

961
01:14:16,252 --> 01:14:17,810
Came to get your stink off.

962
01:14:18,012 --> 01:14:21,482
l'm not the one who blew this
friendship, okay?

963
01:14:22,212 --> 01:14:24,851
-Where's Jessie?
-She stayed home. She's upset.

964
01:14:25,092 --> 01:14:26,730
l don't know what it could be.

965
01:14:26,972 --> 01:14:30,408
-l think you've got a lot of friends.
-Go mingle with them.

966
01:14:30,652 --> 01:14:32,608
Tommy, show Terry to his table.

967
01:14:32,812 --> 01:14:34,609
Talk to you later.

968
01:14:44,292 --> 01:14:45,520
l want something in return.

969
01:14:45,772 --> 01:14:47,603
l want a catalogue
on Bob Marley.

970
01:14:47,852 --> 01:14:49,604
Everything, all the records.

971
01:14:49,852 --> 01:14:51,524
And l want live concerts.

972
01:14:51,772 --> 01:14:53,171
Listen, if l ask him to....

973
01:14:53,812 --> 01:14:55,086
You heard about this band?

974
01:14:56,972 --> 01:14:58,803
lt's supposed to be great.

975
01:14:59,052 --> 01:15:00,610
What are you doing here?

976
01:15:01,292 --> 01:15:03,965
lf you have something to say,
say it and get out.

977
01:15:06,372 --> 01:15:07,725
This guy looks familiar. Why?

978
01:15:08,892 --> 01:15:11,486
Listen, smart ass,
just get out of here.

979
01:15:23,012 --> 01:15:23,808
Go ahead.

980
01:15:27,292 --> 01:15:29,044
-Friend of yours?
-Go ahead.

981
01:15:33,212 --> 01:15:34,361
This guy the show?

982
01:15:37,092 --> 01:15:38,081
Sit down!

983
01:15:40,492 --> 01:15:42,210
You're such a prick.

984
01:15:50,972 --> 01:15:52,291
Thank you!

985
01:15:52,492 --> 01:15:56,451
Well, the good news is that some of
my best friends are here.

986
01:15:56,892 --> 01:15:59,281
The bad news is,
the rest of you are here.

987
01:15:59,492 --> 01:16:02,245
lt's a good thing l'm in music
instead of comedy.

988
01:16:02,692 --> 01:16:05,252
A great act tonight,
straight from my hometown.

989
01:16:05,492 --> 01:16:06,925
Where's my hometown?

990
01:16:07,172 --> 01:16:10,608
Nueva York, New York City.
The Big Apple.

991
01:16:11,292 --> 01:16:15,046
Rotten to the core, as tonight's
group will aptly demonstrate.

992
01:16:15,292 --> 01:16:18,045
They think of themselves
as tropical gangsters...

993
01:16:18,292 --> 01:16:21,125
...Kid Creole and the Coconuts.

994
01:18:39,692 --> 01:18:42,001
Planning Commissioner Soames.

995
01:18:42,652 --> 01:18:43,971
Dealing with politicians.

996
01:18:48,492 --> 01:18:49,925
l'm a top sports accountant.

997
01:18:50,172 --> 01:18:52,527
Soames has been a client
for a long time.

998
01:18:52,772 --> 01:18:54,808
l only deal with uptown people.

999
01:18:55,452 --> 01:18:57,010
Like this guy l'm sitting with?

1000
01:18:57,252 --> 01:18:59,686
Kirsch? This job l have for you...

1001
01:18:59,932 --> 01:19:01,729
...it's got to do with Kirsch.

1002
01:19:02,612 --> 01:19:06,321
You're really coming up in the world.
Lawyers, politicians.

1003
01:19:06,572 --> 01:19:08,881
l've done business
with Kirsch for a long time.

1004
01:19:11,052 --> 01:19:13,805
Yeah. Sully too.

1005
01:19:14,092 --> 01:19:16,401
Sully kept me up on injuries.

1006
01:19:17,212 --> 01:19:18,247
Kirsch let me know...

1007
01:19:18,492 --> 01:19:21,006
...what players wouldn't be renewed.

1008
01:19:21,492 --> 01:19:22,811
l had it great.

1009
01:19:24,252 --> 01:19:26,208
lt's a shitty business, Jake.

1010
01:19:26,452 --> 01:19:28,408
Well, it's a shitty world.

1011
01:19:29,892 --> 01:19:33,726
You see, Kirsch and Sully fixed a
game behind my back.

1012
01:19:33,972 --> 01:19:37,044
Kirsch placed what l thought
was an off-the-wall bet.

1013
01:19:37,252 --> 01:19:39,482
But when he won big...

1014
01:19:39,692 --> 01:19:42,047
...l paid the cocksucker.

1015
01:19:42,252 --> 01:19:45,801
He figured when l lost Jessie,
l was ripe for being screwed.

1016
01:19:46,092 --> 01:19:47,411
Must be an epidemic.

1017
01:19:47,652 --> 01:19:50,325
-How'd you find out?
-Your friend...

1018
01:19:50,572 --> 01:19:51,800
...Sully.

1019
01:19:52,012 --> 01:19:54,606
Kirsch, the son of
a bitch, cheated Sully.

1020
01:19:54,812 --> 01:19:58,202
He figured there would be
some money telling me about it.

1021
01:19:58,892 --> 01:20:01,201
Poor fucking Sully.

1022
01:20:02,252 --> 01:20:04,402
l'd like to kick the shit
out of Kirsch.

1023
01:20:05,972 --> 01:20:07,485
The asshole's got files on me.

1024
01:20:07,732 --> 01:20:09,882
And l'm the idiot who's
supposed to get them?

1025
01:20:10,212 --> 01:20:12,043
He's got records of the games.

1026
01:20:12,292 --> 01:20:15,204
Of the business l did
with the players.

1027
01:20:15,452 --> 01:20:16,680
Know who that includes?

1028
01:20:18,172 --> 01:20:20,606
You got no smart-mouth remark
for that one?

1029
01:20:20,972 --> 01:20:24,760
Here. These will get you into
Kirsch's building and office.

1030
01:20:25,212 --> 01:20:28,284
Sunday night. Late.
lt's a little dirty...

1031
01:20:28,532 --> 01:20:30,841
...but not so dirty you won't
sleep nights.

1032
01:20:31,852 --> 01:20:32,921
Why me? Why not Tommy?

1033
01:20:33,172 --> 01:20:34,287
l want Tommy clean.

1034
01:20:35,892 --> 01:20:39,202
You? l was ready to be
your friend for life.

1035
01:20:39,412 --> 01:20:41,642
You owe me.
This is what l want from you.

1036
01:20:41,852 --> 01:20:44,810
lt's in our mutual interest.
As far as l'm concerned...

1037
01:20:45,052 --> 01:20:47,805
...it finishes all the shit
between us.

1038
01:20:49,852 --> 01:20:51,604
l'm missing the show.

1039
01:20:53,412 --> 01:20:56,290
What made you think you
could handle Jessie?

1040
01:20:56,532 --> 01:20:58,124
l bet you brought her flowers.

1041
01:20:59,052 --> 01:21:01,805
You don't have to when
you're living in the jungle.

1042
01:21:02,492 --> 01:21:05,450
You just show her what tree
you're gonna do it under.

1043
01:21:10,492 --> 01:21:13,006
Hell, we hit lots of trees.

1044
01:21:36,092 --> 01:21:39,289
Shit! Now you follow me
into the toilet. Give me a break!

1045
01:21:40,092 --> 01:21:40,888
What is this?

1046
01:21:41,132 --> 01:21:42,850
lt's a warning. Be careful.

1047
01:21:43,092 --> 01:21:45,845
Okay. l'm going to be
very careful, all right?

1048
01:21:46,092 --> 01:21:47,207
Just fuck right off.

1049
01:21:47,452 --> 01:21:50,603
You think we're at the same
table by accident?

1050
01:21:51,852 --> 01:21:54,685
l figure the bet was you'd
make a scene. We'd be noticed.

1051
01:21:54,892 --> 01:21:57,122
Really?

1052
01:21:57,812 --> 01:22:01,407
l'm looking out for myself.
l've done what l can for you.

1053
01:22:02,412 --> 01:22:04,209
Okay, fuck off.

1054
01:22:50,172 --> 01:22:53,209
l keep thinking of what l
did to make me deserve you.

1055
01:22:53,412 --> 01:22:54,845
Go to hell.

1056
01:22:55,092 --> 01:22:57,242
l have. You know that, lady!

1057
01:22:58,652 --> 01:23:00,370
What's it like with Jake?

1058
01:23:00,572 --> 01:23:02,688
When you two are doing it?
ls he good?

1059
01:23:02,932 --> 01:23:04,411
Shut up, Terry!

1060
01:23:04,652 --> 01:23:06,802
Does he have a bigger cock than l do?

1061
01:23:07,492 --> 01:23:09,005
Shut up!

1062
01:23:30,412 --> 01:23:32,403
Do you know what he wants
me to do?

1063
01:23:35,092 --> 01:23:37,003
You and l have seen worse.

1064
01:23:38,492 --> 01:23:42,405
Jake's a gambler. He thinks l took
his luck when l took you.

1065
01:23:44,812 --> 01:23:46,131
l hit him too hard.

1066
01:23:46,372 --> 01:23:47,725
Then get out of it now.

1067
01:23:47,972 --> 01:23:51,203
But what about all the things
you and l shared?

1068
01:23:52,092 --> 01:23:54,003
What about Sully?

1069
01:23:56,412 --> 01:23:58,801
You remember him?

1070
01:23:59,012 --> 01:24:01,606
That guy we killed down
there in the jungle.

1071
01:24:05,972 --> 01:24:08,805
He's got me one way
or the other, doesn't he?

1072
01:24:10,692 --> 01:24:12,410
Doesn't he?

1073
01:24:16,612 --> 01:24:19,809
Yeah, go ahead, you rip
the shirt off. Come on.

1074
01:24:20,892 --> 01:24:22,803
Rip the shirt off.

1075
01:24:26,052 --> 01:24:28,612
Rip the fucking shirt off!

1076
01:24:38,892 --> 01:24:40,803
What am l gonna do?

1077
01:24:42,892 --> 01:24:45,042
Oh, Terry! l'm sorry.

1078
01:24:45,292 --> 01:24:49,251
-l'm so sorry.
-l love you.

1079
01:24:49,492 --> 01:24:51,084
Hold me.

1080
01:24:52,092 --> 01:24:53,844
Hold me!

1081
01:24:54,092 --> 01:24:56,208
What are we gonna do?

1082
01:25:16,652 --> 01:25:18,324
ls this Sam?

1083
01:25:18,572 --> 01:25:22,804
ls this Sam? l bet it is Sam,
is it? There's Sam.

1084
01:25:23,972 --> 01:25:27,601
Sam's crazy about me.
That's a fact.

1085
01:25:28,572 --> 01:25:31,211
You know, dogs kill
for people they love.

1086
01:25:31,692 --> 01:25:34,604
Maybe Sam knows l'd kill for you.

1087
01:25:34,812 --> 01:25:36,040
-What do you mean?
-See that?

1088
01:25:36,252 --> 01:25:38,720
Now you're looking at me.

1089
01:25:38,972 --> 01:25:41,805
Why do l have to frighten you
to get you to look at me?

1090
01:25:43,652 --> 01:25:45,244
l give you everything you want.

1091
01:25:45,852 --> 01:25:50,209
Your mother and Caxton can't hurt me.
You're not even afraid of them anymore.

1092
01:25:56,412 --> 01:25:59,131
You know, when you came
at me with a knife...

1093
01:25:59,332 --> 01:26:02,404
...all l could think of
was that you'd hurt yourself.

1094
01:26:03,892 --> 01:26:06,452
l'm not spitting in your face.

1095
01:26:06,692 --> 01:26:09,001
l just want you to let me go.

1096
01:26:09,692 --> 01:26:12,525
When we were first together...

1097
01:26:12,772 --> 01:26:14,808
...it was so great.

1098
01:26:15,612 --> 01:26:19,400
l finally impressed those fucks
in Beverly Hills. Remember?

1099
01:26:20,892 --> 01:26:22,610
You know what was even better?

1100
01:26:23,092 --> 01:26:24,810
You were smart.

1101
01:26:26,172 --> 01:26:27,810
You really helped me.

1102
01:26:30,052 --> 01:26:32,043
But l don't care about
any of that now.

1103
01:26:33,092 --> 01:26:34,810
l need you.

1104
01:26:35,772 --> 01:26:37,842
lt's just not okay to be alone anymore.

1105
01:26:39,572 --> 01:26:40,800
No, Jake.

1106
01:26:43,052 --> 01:26:46,886
You ruined my life. Goddamn it,
l'm not gonna lose you.

1107
01:27:30,612 --> 01:27:34,241
He's got files on the business I did
with the players.

1108
01:27:34,492 --> 01:27:37,609
You do want to play ball
again, don't you, Terry?

1109
01:27:49,012 --> 01:27:50,570
Sunday night.

1110
01:27:50,812 --> 01:27:52,404
Late.

1111
01:27:53,652 --> 01:27:57,406
It's a little dirty, but not so
dirty you won't sleep nights.

1112
01:29:26,172 --> 01:29:27,810
Steve?

1113
01:29:30,892 --> 01:29:32,610
Steve?

1114
01:31:53,692 --> 01:31:55,603
This is what Jake owes you--

1115
01:32:56,892 --> 01:33:00,089
Jesus Christ! What?

1116
01:33:00,332 --> 01:33:02,687
l hid the body.
They'll find it soon.

1117
01:33:02,892 --> 01:33:04,564
He killed him?

1118
01:33:04,812 --> 01:33:07,246
He had him killed?

1119
01:33:07,492 --> 01:33:08,971
Oh, my God!

1120
01:33:11,052 --> 01:33:13,168
Not that it's any great loss, but....

1121
01:33:14,572 --> 01:33:17,405
Jake Wise planted
something up in his office...

1122
01:33:18,292 --> 01:33:19,725
...to frame me.

1123
01:33:19,972 --> 01:33:22,202
l didn't find it in time.

1124
01:33:23,372 --> 01:33:24,521
They're all bastards.

1125
01:33:25,092 --> 01:33:28,243
-All of them.
-Look, Edie, l need your help.

1126
01:33:28,452 --> 01:33:30,363
You worked with Kirsch
for a long time.

1127
01:33:31,852 --> 01:33:33,729
You'd knock the hell out of them.

1128
01:33:34,692 --> 01:33:35,681
What do you mean?

1129
01:33:36,892 --> 01:33:39,452
l don't know what Jake planted.

1130
01:33:39,692 --> 01:33:44,208
But Kirsch kept a tiny treasure
chest that could blow everybody up.

1131
01:33:46,252 --> 01:33:47,810
l shouldn't be this drunk.

1132
01:33:48,052 --> 01:33:50,168
Listen, if the booze helps....

1133
01:33:52,492 --> 01:33:55,086
l can't believe this is my life.

1134
01:33:58,172 --> 01:34:01,050
Where was this box?

1135
01:34:03,492 --> 01:34:05,403
l'd be too scared to do it.

1136
01:34:05,652 --> 01:34:08,724
You worked for Kirsch. You knew
most of what he knew.

1137
01:34:08,972 --> 01:34:12,044
Edie, they'll kill you too.

1138
01:34:12,292 --> 01:34:14,248
Edie, help me.

1139
01:34:15,172 --> 01:34:17,845
-But it means....
-What?

1140
01:34:18,052 --> 01:34:21,010
Going back there.
To Kirsch's office.

1141
01:34:59,012 --> 01:35:00,525
There shouldn't be a dog here.

1142
01:35:02,292 --> 01:35:04,010
Who the hell are you?

1143
01:35:04,892 --> 01:35:07,247
l worked for Kirsch.

1144
01:35:07,492 --> 01:35:09,562
You must be the one
who unemployed me.

1145
01:35:13,852 --> 01:35:15,205
Sit.

1146
01:35:16,772 --> 01:35:17,841
Are the others here?

1147
01:35:18,852 --> 01:35:21,844
They're all over the building.
Looking for the body.

1148
01:35:25,972 --> 01:35:27,087
Some mess.

1149
01:35:27,332 --> 01:35:28,765
We're gonna find him.

1150
01:35:33,492 --> 01:35:36,609
Jake wants certain things
out of the office right away.

1151
01:35:37,892 --> 01:35:39,405
Why?

1152
01:35:42,012 --> 01:35:44,207
l guess he's a little jumpy.

1153
01:35:45,892 --> 01:35:48,042
Things seem to be
disappearing, don't they?

1154
01:36:14,412 --> 01:36:16,164
Your dog bothers me.

1155
01:36:16,412 --> 01:36:18,448
lt's supposed to bother people.

1156
01:36:20,692 --> 01:36:22,444
Put him in there, please.

1157
01:36:30,692 --> 01:36:34,162
You're making this take
much more time than it has to.

1158
01:36:38,052 --> 01:36:39,963
Mr. Wise is waiting for me.

1159
01:36:43,372 --> 01:36:44,805
Listen...

1160
01:36:45,572 --> 01:36:47,449
...you're not a security guard.

1161
01:36:47,692 --> 01:36:50,843
But l belong here.
Now put the goddamn dog in there!

1162
01:37:07,092 --> 01:37:08,605
Stay.

1163
01:37:35,932 --> 01:37:36,967
Hello, Mr. Wise.

1164
01:37:38,852 --> 01:37:42,811
No, we haven't found Kirsch's body.
Don't worry about it.

1165
01:37:44,092 --> 01:37:47,323
Don't get excited.
Gonna take it a floor at a time.

1166
01:37:47,892 --> 01:37:49,803
l'm sure of it.

1167
01:37:50,012 --> 01:37:53,209
No, we're in the office
looking for those papers.

1168
01:37:55,372 --> 01:37:57,602
The ones you asked that girl to get.

1169
01:37:59,052 --> 01:38:00,041
Hey, come back here!

1170
01:38:01,452 --> 01:38:02,248
Get back!

1171
01:38:02,852 --> 01:38:04,126
You crazy bitch!

1172
01:38:04,372 --> 01:38:05,805
Who are you? Goddamn it!

1173
01:38:06,052 --> 01:38:07,201
Who the hell are you?

1174
01:38:16,732 --> 01:38:17,642
You're dead!

1175
01:38:34,892 --> 01:38:35,688
Run, Edie!

1176
01:38:57,852 --> 01:38:59,080
Come on!

1177
01:39:03,372 --> 01:39:05,806
-Did you get the papers?
-Yes, l got them!

1178
01:39:10,492 --> 01:39:13,006
-Here, l'll park it for you.
-l live here.

1179
01:39:24,092 --> 01:39:25,320
Jessica.

1180
01:39:26,212 --> 01:39:27,406
Hello, Mother.

1181
01:39:29,692 --> 01:39:30,886
You're looking well.

1182
01:39:31,892 --> 01:39:33,166
l need to see Ben.

1183
01:39:33,692 --> 01:39:35,205
l've missed you.

1184
01:39:36,892 --> 01:39:38,689
Please get Ben, Mother.
Please.

1185
01:39:38,932 --> 01:39:40,763
He's much too busy celebrating.

1186
01:39:41,412 --> 01:39:44,609
Bob Soames changed his vote
on Wyler Canyon.

1187
01:39:45,372 --> 01:39:46,407
Why do you want Ben?

1188
01:39:47,692 --> 01:39:49,410
l just wanna talk to him.

1189
01:39:50,652 --> 01:39:54,042
-Talk to him tomorrow.
-No, l need to speak to him now!

1190
01:39:54,292 --> 01:39:56,362
-Right now!
-Keep your voice down.

1191
01:39:56,612 --> 01:39:58,443
l'll embarrass you, Mother.

1192
01:39:59,212 --> 01:40:03,000
l'll just walk right in there
and l'll be my sweet self.

1193
01:40:03,572 --> 01:40:04,448
Hello, Jessie.

1194
01:40:05,292 --> 01:40:07,328
Hello, Ben.

1195
01:40:07,572 --> 01:40:09,927
l have to talk to you, alone.

1196
01:40:11,212 --> 01:40:12,531
-Excuse us.
-Sure.

1197
01:40:12,772 --> 01:40:14,410
Let's go in there.

1198
01:40:16,172 --> 01:40:17,844
Jake's had Kirsch killed.

1199
01:40:18,052 --> 01:40:20,247
He's made it look like Terry did it.

1200
01:40:20,492 --> 01:40:23,564
He was trying to get Terry,
but it's more than that.

1201
01:40:23,772 --> 01:40:26,445
He was fixing games and betting
against his own bank.

1202
01:40:26,692 --> 01:40:28,250
Kirsch was making the bets.

1203
01:40:28,492 --> 01:40:30,801
Something's going down at Kirsch's.

1204
01:40:31,012 --> 01:40:34,209
Brogan wouldn't have gone back.
Why would he?

1205
01:40:34,452 --> 01:40:35,805
He'd be crazy to.

1206
01:40:36,012 --> 01:40:39,209
Would you get over there
and find out what's going on?

1207
01:40:54,412 --> 01:40:56,403
You've gotten out of hand, Jake.

1208
01:40:59,052 --> 01:41:00,405
Come on, Tommy.

1209
01:41:08,212 --> 01:41:09,122
What've you done to me?

1210
01:41:11,052 --> 01:41:13,168
He's here to help me,
not hurt you.

1211
01:41:13,612 --> 01:41:15,250
The things you don't know.

1212
01:41:15,492 --> 01:41:19,121
This man that you, your mother and
everybody thinks so much of...

1213
01:41:19,372 --> 01:41:20,248
...he's my bank.

1214
01:41:21,732 --> 01:41:22,687
l work for him.

1215
01:41:23,292 --> 01:41:24,088
Ben?

1216
01:41:25,292 --> 01:41:28,170
Ben! You told him
everything, didn't you?

1217
01:41:29,092 --> 01:41:31,003
Didn't you?

1218
01:41:31,892 --> 01:41:34,201
Oh, God!

1219
01:41:34,452 --> 01:41:38,331
You're still trying to kill me.
This time l might be dead.

1220
01:41:46,892 --> 01:41:48,610
l love you, Jessie.

1221
01:41:50,212 --> 01:41:52,407
Why did that have to be a bad thing?

1222
01:41:54,212 --> 01:41:56,282
l didn't mean anything bad.

1223
01:41:59,572 --> 01:42:01,802
Your office is still busy.

1224
01:42:07,852 --> 01:42:08,648
That you, Brogan?

1225
01:42:11,452 --> 01:42:12,407
Hello, Brogan.

1226
01:42:12,652 --> 01:42:13,846
Who's this?

1227
01:42:14,092 --> 01:42:17,846
Hey, Senor Caxton!
Couldn't catch the game tonight.

1228
01:42:18,092 --> 01:42:19,525
We won. Listen, Brogan...

1229
01:42:20,252 --> 01:42:23,050
...l'm getting into this because
of my goddaughter.

1230
01:42:23,292 --> 01:42:26,602
l'll tell you, there's
somebody else you gotta help.

1231
01:42:27,092 --> 01:42:27,922
Yourself.

1232
01:42:31,012 --> 01:42:33,401
l've just been in Kirsch's safe.

1233
01:42:34,012 --> 01:42:37,243
You know what he had in there?
The goods on you...

1234
01:42:38,252 --> 01:42:41,449
...Supervisor Phillips...
a whole lot of people.

1235
01:42:41,692 --> 01:42:43,808
l know all about Soames.

1236
01:42:44,052 --> 01:42:47,283
You know, the commissioner
who wanted to...

1237
01:42:47,532 --> 01:42:51,002
...protect the environment
but liked to bet on football too.

1238
01:42:52,452 --> 01:42:55,364
Guess he found out the
two don't mix, didn't he?

1239
01:42:56,252 --> 01:42:57,810
l think we should meet.

1240
01:42:58,052 --> 01:42:59,246
l got no problem with that.

1241
01:42:59,492 --> 01:43:02,848
ln fact, l know a great place.
Wyler Canyon, in an hour.

1242
01:43:03,052 --> 01:43:05,486
The spot where
you're gonna break ground.

1243
01:43:05,692 --> 01:43:07,444
l know the place.

1244
01:43:11,492 --> 01:43:15,405
That idiot football player
you were going to get...

1245
01:43:15,772 --> 01:43:18,411
...has got me by the balls.

1246
01:43:19,172 --> 01:43:20,400
Come on.

1247
01:43:21,292 --> 01:43:22,691
Jessie.

1248
01:43:22,892 --> 01:43:25,008
You too, Wise.

1249
01:43:37,892 --> 01:43:41,168
Your friend Brogan is a threat
to me, Jessie.

1250
01:43:41,372 --> 01:43:44,967
l don't know what he wants,
but it's got to be settled.

1251
01:43:45,212 --> 01:43:47,851
l can't believe this is you, Ben.

1252
01:43:48,092 --> 01:43:50,401
l think my mother would
snap if she knew.

1253
01:43:50,652 --> 01:43:53,007
l get things done in this town.

1254
01:43:53,212 --> 01:43:55,806
And the people l work for,
like your mother...

1255
01:43:56,052 --> 01:43:59,124
...don't care how that happens.
Just that l do it.

1256
01:44:00,332 --> 01:44:03,449
She wants Wyler Canyon developed,
but she can't...

1257
01:44:03,652 --> 01:44:06,450
...get to everyone
with campaign contributions.

1258
01:44:06,692 --> 01:44:11,049
So l have to go into business
with some very strange people.

1259
01:44:11,292 --> 01:44:13,886
Like that asshole next to you.

1260
01:44:14,132 --> 01:44:16,168
l don't have to take this from you.

1261
01:44:16,812 --> 01:44:18,086
He's as dirty as l am.

1262
01:44:18,852 --> 01:44:21,969
He owns 75% of the
book and 75% of the club.

1263
01:44:22,732 --> 01:44:24,962
l take the heat while
he sits on his ass.

1264
01:44:25,212 --> 01:44:26,804
Shut him up, Tommy!

1265
01:44:28,132 --> 01:44:31,602
He got you into this. Now convince
me you're not an asshole.

1266
01:44:35,532 --> 01:44:37,204
Come on, Tommy.

1267
01:44:37,492 --> 01:44:39,244
They'll never let you sit on top.

1268
01:44:39,492 --> 01:44:42,325
When you had Kirsch killed,
you buried yourself.

1269
01:44:42,572 --> 01:44:44,688
You think they'll ever
do business with you?

1270
01:44:44,932 --> 01:44:45,921
Wise up!

1271
01:44:46,172 --> 01:44:50,848
No one in Beverly Hills is ever gonna
do business with a black man.

1272
01:44:51,292 --> 01:44:53,044
Shut up, Jake.
You're a dead man.

1273
01:44:53,292 --> 01:44:54,805
Not yet, Caxton.

1274
01:44:55,012 --> 01:44:57,242
Brogan won't beat anybody.
l'll get him.

1275
01:44:57,492 --> 01:44:59,210
You need me.
Put that gun away.

1276
01:44:59,452 --> 01:45:01,010
Take it, Jake.

1277
01:45:01,652 --> 01:45:03,404
My best friend?

1278
01:45:31,092 --> 01:45:31,888
Brogan!

1279
01:45:32,772 --> 01:45:35,889
-Watch it, they've got a gun!
-Shut up, Jessie!

1280
01:45:36,092 --> 01:45:38,287
That's okay, Jessie!

1281
01:45:38,492 --> 01:45:41,643
Things have a way of getting
messed up when you're in them.

1282
01:45:47,892 --> 01:45:50,406
What the hell are you doing, Brogan?

1283
01:45:52,652 --> 01:45:55,610
This mountain's pretty important
to you, isn't it?

1284
01:45:55,812 --> 01:45:56,722
With what l got...

1285
01:45:56,972 --> 01:45:59,645
...from Kirsch, l can
knock your plans to hell!

1286
01:46:00,692 --> 01:46:02,683
Mrs. Wyler wouldn't like that,
would she?

1287
01:46:02,892 --> 01:46:03,961
What do you want?

1288
01:46:09,292 --> 01:46:10,088
Don't shoot!

1289
01:46:14,532 --> 01:46:16,011
You're trying to kill me!

1290
01:46:16,212 --> 01:46:18,567
What do you think?
l wanna stay alive!

1291
01:46:18,772 --> 01:46:20,410
What do you want?

1292
01:46:20,652 --> 01:46:22,529
l didn't want you, Caxton!

1293
01:46:23,172 --> 01:46:25,367
l want Jake's shit out of my life!

1294
01:46:26,212 --> 01:46:28,248
Now l want yours out too!

1295
01:46:28,452 --> 01:46:30,283
That's all you want?

1296
01:46:30,572 --> 01:46:32,403
Why don't l believe you?

1297
01:46:33,772 --> 01:46:35,728
Because you're a corrupt old man.

1298
01:46:59,932 --> 01:47:02,048
Your coverage stinks, Tommy.

1299
01:47:08,332 --> 01:47:09,606
What's your deal, Brogan?

1300
01:47:10,252 --> 01:47:13,801
l found out tonight Jake jumps for you.
Slap him down.

1301
01:47:14,052 --> 01:47:15,565
lt's that fucking simple.

1302
01:47:16,612 --> 01:47:19,126
l'll keep Kirsch's stuff
until l'm satisfied.

1303
01:47:22,812 --> 01:47:24,450
That can be arranged.

1304
01:47:25,652 --> 01:47:26,528
Are you crazy?

1305
01:47:27,372 --> 01:47:29,488
Don't let this punk beat you.

1306
01:47:29,732 --> 01:47:33,691
lt can still work. The trainer,
the lawyer and the player...

1307
01:47:33,932 --> 01:47:35,081
...cheating on the fix!

1308
01:47:35,332 --> 01:47:36,128
Knock it off!

1309
01:47:40,212 --> 01:47:41,361
Drop the gun.

1310
01:47:43,092 --> 01:47:44,286
Drop the fucking gun.

1311
01:47:48,492 --> 01:47:52,007
Take the gun away from her head.
You're not gonna hurt her.

1312
01:47:53,372 --> 01:47:55,806
You wanna gamble with me, Terry?
Go ahead.

1313
01:47:58,892 --> 01:48:00,211
Go ahead.

1314
01:48:05,972 --> 01:48:07,928
Take the gun away.

1315
01:48:08,212 --> 01:48:10,601
You're my friend. You know me.
Take your shot.

1316
01:48:21,892 --> 01:48:24,326
Don't do it, Terry.
He won't hurt me.

1317
01:48:27,292 --> 01:48:29,601
l'm not gonna take that chance.

1318
01:48:35,012 --> 01:48:36,206
Thattaboy.

1319
01:48:38,172 --> 01:48:41,209
Don't think about it. l'll blow
you away. Step back.

1320
01:48:41,452 --> 01:48:43,602
Step fucking back.

1321
01:48:57,692 --> 01:49:00,968
Who's gonna be a dead man, Caxton?
Not me.

1322
01:49:11,292 --> 01:49:12,441
lt's gotta be Terry.

1323
01:49:15,172 --> 01:49:17,606
What makes somebody
your friend, Jake?

1324
01:49:18,212 --> 01:49:20,407
How much shit they'll do for you?

1325
01:49:21,492 --> 01:49:22,641
Jake, don't do it.

1326
01:49:25,452 --> 01:49:26,487
Jake, l love him!

1327
01:49:29,212 --> 01:49:30,565
Right in my face.

1328
01:49:33,252 --> 01:49:35,561
Right in my fucking face.

1329
01:49:37,252 --> 01:49:38,526
l'll blow him the fuck--

1330
01:50:00,732 --> 01:50:02,450
Keep away from her, Brogan.

1331
01:50:03,292 --> 01:50:05,123
You can't help her with this.

1332
01:50:06,012 --> 01:50:07,491
But you can, Caxton.

1333
01:50:07,732 --> 01:50:09,211
l think so.

1334
01:50:09,812 --> 01:50:13,009
But it means doing things my way.

1335
01:50:13,692 --> 01:50:15,922
l want that stuff from Kirsch.

1336
01:50:16,692 --> 01:50:20,002
And Jessie's going back
where she belongs.

1337
01:50:20,892 --> 01:50:22,769
You'll leave him alone, Ben.

1338
01:50:27,812 --> 01:50:32,602
l'll do what you want,
but you'll leave him alone.

1339
01:50:39,372 --> 01:50:43,490
What l'm most happy about is the
opportunity to share this land.

1340
01:50:43,692 --> 01:50:45,603
lt's beauty and the beauty around it...

1341
01:50:45,852 --> 01:50:49,845
...won't be sitting up here
alone anymore, just going to waste.

1342
01:50:50,052 --> 01:50:54,603
l'm sharing what l believe is the best
location on the West Side.

1343
01:50:54,852 --> 01:50:57,685
Close to Century City and the ocean.

1344
01:50:58,052 --> 01:51:00,247
We won't crowd the hillsides.

1345
01:51:00,452 --> 01:51:04,127
Each owner will feel that
the canyon belongs to him.

1346
01:51:04,372 --> 01:51:09,002
A sanctuary from the crowding
and crime of the city below us.

1347
01:51:10,732 --> 01:51:14,884
Specifically, l'd like to acknowledge
three public officials...

1348
01:51:15,132 --> 01:51:19,011
...without whose generous support
we wouldn't be here:

1349
01:51:21,572 --> 01:51:23,642
Supervisor Ed Phillips...

1350
01:51:30,132 --> 01:51:31,884
...Councilman Leonard Weinberg...

1351
01:51:32,092 --> 01:51:33,810
Stay here.

1352
01:51:35,292 --> 01:51:37,123
Just remember your promise, Ben.

1353
01:51:40,012 --> 01:51:43,243
...and the head of the commission,
Bob Soames.

1354
01:51:43,492 --> 01:51:46,165
Thank you, gentlemen.

1355
01:51:48,412 --> 01:51:49,561
Now for the big moment.

1356
01:51:51,492 --> 01:51:54,768
This was the only way you could
get a look at her, eh?

1357
01:51:54,972 --> 01:51:56,644
Nothing stops progress, does it?

1358
01:51:57,292 --> 01:52:01,808
We had to put it off for six months
until things died down in the press.

1359
01:52:02,052 --> 01:52:03,849
Moving 5 million yards of earth.

1360
01:52:04,092 --> 01:52:07,084
Enough to fill dump trucks
from here to Nova Scotia.

1361
01:52:08,092 --> 01:52:10,447
This town does
belong to people like you.

1362
01:52:11,252 --> 01:52:14,050
You and her mother control
what she says and does.

1363
01:52:15,292 --> 01:52:18,602
There's nothing in the news that
isn't the way you wanted it.

1364
01:52:18,852 --> 01:52:21,366
Jake Wise did things even he'd
freak out about.

1365
01:52:22,092 --> 01:52:24,322
There's a lot of sympathy for her.

1366
01:52:25,052 --> 01:52:26,565
Well, there should be.

1367
01:52:26,812 --> 01:52:29,167
lt didn't seem to hurt you, Brogan.

1368
01:52:29,372 --> 01:52:32,808
l heard you got some tryouts
with good teams.

1369
01:52:34,652 --> 01:52:36,131
l'm playing with the Dolphins.

1370
01:52:36,372 --> 01:52:39,330
That's one you couldn't put
a stop to, could you?

1371
01:52:41,012 --> 01:52:42,445
l'll be ready.

1372
01:52:42,692 --> 01:52:45,126
Couple of good years
and l'll quit on my own.

1373
01:52:45,372 --> 01:52:48,682
So you're going to leave L.A.
Good.

1374
01:52:50,092 --> 01:52:53,050
When you need me in court,
l'll be there for her.

1375
01:52:53,292 --> 01:52:56,204
But forget anything else.

1376
01:52:56,452 --> 01:53:00,684
Remember, Brogan,
you're out of her life.

1377
01:53:05,572 --> 01:53:06,971
l figure that's up to her.

1378
01:53:08,092 --> 01:53:10,208
You're not gonna control us forever.

1379
01:53:10,412 --> 01:53:12,209
Believe me.
