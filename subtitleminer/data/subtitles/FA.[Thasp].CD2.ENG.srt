1
00:00:18,763 --> 00:00:20,321
<i>Operator. May I help you? </i>

2
00:00:20,765 --> 00:00:25,202
Operator, I've been trying
to get 555-8129. 212?

3
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:29,639
- Recording says it's been disconnected.
- <i>Just a moment, please. </i>

4
00:00:29,774 --> 00:00:31,765
<i>I'm sorry, the number's been</i>
<i>changed to an unlisted number. </i>

5
00:00:32,277 --> 00:00:34,711
Operator, this is a real emergency.
You need to give me that number.

6
00:00:34,779 --> 00:00:36,770
<i>I'm sorry. We're not allowed</i>
<i>to give out that information. </i>

7
00:00:37,282 --> 00:00:40,513
- Well, fuck you!
- <i>My place or yours? </i>

8
00:01:17,322 --> 00:01:21,224
- I like it. I like it a lot.
- Well, we've been very happy here.

9
00:01:21,326 --> 00:01:23,487
I'd definitely like
to think about it, if I could.

10
00:01:26,331 --> 00:01:27,764
- It's so clean.
- Yes.

11
00:01:27,832 --> 00:01:31,233
We have a cleaning lady who comes in
a couple times a week.

12
00:01:31,836 --> 00:01:34,771
- I can certainly give you her name.
- I'd love that.

13
00:01:34,839 --> 00:01:37,569
And there's baby-sitters galore.
The whole works.

14
00:01:37,842 --> 00:01:41,175
Whatever information you would need.
You know, they have...

15
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:48,251
Hi, darling.
Darling, this is Alex.

16
00:01:48,353 --> 00:01:50,685
- I've forgotten your last name.
- Alex Forest.

17
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:57,093
Hi. Glad to meet you.

18
00:01:58,163 --> 00:01:59,528
Nice to meet you.

19
00:02:02,167 --> 00:02:04,601
Haven't we met somewhere before?

20
00:02:04,669 --> 00:02:06,034
I don't think so, no.

21
00:02:10,575 --> 00:02:13,100
We have.
Weren't you at that party...

22
00:02:13,178 --> 00:02:15,078
at the Japanese place
a few weeks ago?

23
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,080
Honey, the exercise book.

24
00:02:18,183 --> 00:02:19,616
Oh, yeah.

25
00:02:19,684 --> 00:02:23,677
You're a lawyer and you work
for the firm of...

26
00:02:24,155 --> 00:02:29,115
What's the name?
Well, anyway, we've definitely met.

27
00:02:29,194 --> 00:02:31,128
Well, you have a good memory.

28
00:02:31,196 --> 00:02:32,993
I never forget a face.

29
00:02:33,198 --> 00:02:34,790
It's a small world.

30
00:02:35,266 --> 00:02:37,734
It certainly is.

31
00:02:39,704 --> 00:02:41,865
So, I gather
you're going to the country?

32
00:02:42,607 --> 00:02:45,633
- Moving to the country?
- Yes.

33
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:48,770
- Have you found a place yet?
- We found a place in Bedford.

34
00:02:49,214 --> 00:02:52,081
- Do you know it up there?
- Oh, it's beautiful, yes.

35
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,150
I guess you'll be moving
out of here almost immediately?

36
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:58,656
Actually, we wanted to do
some remodeling first.

37
00:02:58,723 --> 00:03:01,123
I guess you're looking for a place
right away, aren't you?

38
00:03:01,226 --> 00:03:03,387
Well, yeah,
I'd kind of like to settle in.

39
00:03:03,728 --> 00:03:06,060
Alex is expecting a baby.

40
00:03:08,233 --> 00:03:10,667
Oh, that's...

41
00:03:11,236 --> 00:03:14,205
Will you excuse me?
I have some work I've got to do.

42
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,435
I better run too.

43
00:03:17,742 --> 00:03:21,178
Thank you for the tea
and showing me the apartment.

44
00:03:21,246 --> 00:03:23,714
- You're very welcome.
- I like it.

45
00:03:23,748 --> 00:03:26,774
- I really like it.
- We've been very happy here.

46
00:03:27,252 --> 00:03:29,152
I'd like to think about it,
if I could.

47
00:03:29,254 --> 00:03:31,688
Let me give you our number
so you can call us direct.

48
00:03:31,756 --> 00:03:33,314
Thank you.

49
00:03:50,775 --> 00:03:53,369
- I'll keep in touch.
- Great.

50
00:03:54,345 --> 00:03:56,404
- Bye-bye.
- Good-bye.

51
00:04:00,285 --> 00:04:03,220
She seemed really interested.

52
00:04:03,288 --> 00:04:05,188
It's funny.
She didn't mention a husband.

53
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:08,225
I get the feeling
that she's on her own.

54
00:04:08,293 --> 00:04:10,921
- What is it? You seem down.
- No, I'm just tired.

55
00:04:30,815 --> 00:04:33,181
- <i>Hello? </i>
- Hi, it's me.

56
00:04:33,318 --> 00:04:35,752
<i>Who? </i>

57
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:39,483
You know damn well who it is.
Let me in. I wanna talk.

58
00:04:39,824 --> 00:04:41,724
<i>So now you wanna talk? </i>

59
00:04:59,344 --> 00:05:02,677
So, what can I get you?
I've got scotch, vodka.

60
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:06,305
- I've got a nice chablis...
- Cut the shit, will you?

61
00:05:06,351 --> 00:05:07,909
Just cut it!

62
00:05:11,356 --> 00:05:13,290
I don't know what you're up to...

63
00:05:13,358 --> 00:05:15,258
but I'm gonna tell you
it's gonna stop right now.

64
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,293
No, it's not gonna stop.
It's gonna go on and on...

65
00:05:17,362 --> 00:05:19,262
until you face up
to your responsibilities.

66
00:05:19,864 --> 00:05:21,058
What responsibilities?

67
00:05:21,366 --> 00:05:24,301
I'm pregnant.
I'm going to have our child.

68
00:05:24,369 --> 00:05:27,805
That's your choice, honey.
That has nothing to do with me.

69
00:05:27,872 --> 00:05:29,772
I just wanna be
a part of your life.

70
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:32,809
This is the way you do it, huh?
Showing up at my apartment?

71
00:05:32,877 --> 00:05:34,811
What am I supposed to do?
You won't answer my calls.

72
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:38,679
You change your number.
I'm not going to be ignored!

73
00:05:42,387 --> 00:05:44,685
You don't get it.
You just... You don't get it.

74
00:05:46,391 --> 00:05:48,916
Don't you remember our weekend?

75
00:05:49,394 --> 00:05:52,363
I mean, wasn't that wonderful?

76
00:05:52,397 --> 00:05:54,661
Why can't we just
be like that again?

77
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:59,336
I know you feel it too.
I mean, what are you so afraid of?

78
00:05:59,404 --> 00:06:01,304
Hey, don't flatter yourself.

79
00:06:02,907 --> 00:06:05,842
Go ahead, hit me.
If you can't fuck me, just hit me.

80
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:08,879
You're so sad. Do you know that?
You're lonely and very sad.

81
00:06:09,414 --> 00:06:12,076
Don't you ever pity me,
you smug bastard.

82
00:06:12,316 --> 00:06:14,876
I'll pity you,
because you're sick.

83
00:06:14,986 --> 00:06:17,853
Why? Because I won't allow you
to treat me like some slut...

84
00:06:17,922 --> 00:06:21,016
you can just bang a couple times
and throw in the garbage?

85
00:06:24,762 --> 00:06:27,856
I'm gonna be
the mother of your child.

86
00:06:27,932 --> 00:06:29,900
I want a little respect.

87
00:06:33,438 --> 00:06:35,338
You want respect?

88
00:06:38,443 --> 00:06:40,570
- Respect.
- What are you doing?

89
00:06:40,978 --> 00:06:43,879
Please don't go.
I didn't mean it. I'm sorry.

90
00:06:43,981 --> 00:06:45,881
I'll tell your wife.

91
00:06:47,952 --> 00:06:50,921
You tell my wife, I'll kill you.

92
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:55,426
It only takes a phone call!

93
00:07:01,966 --> 00:07:04,799
<i>Hello? Hello? </i>

94
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,607
Guys, that's on the second door
to the left all the way in the landing.

95
00:07:17,982 --> 00:07:20,075
Thank you.

96
00:07:20,485 --> 00:07:22,419
You could have stayed
in the apartment.

97
00:07:22,487 --> 00:07:24,421
Dan was in such a hurry
to get out of New York.

98
00:07:24,489 --> 00:07:27,219
Mama, that's you, isn't it?

99
00:07:27,492 --> 00:07:29,426
Oh, Lord, put it away.

100
00:07:29,994 --> 00:07:31,894
All right, easy on that door frame.

101
00:07:32,997 --> 00:07:34,760
Nice, nice.
Just like a glove.

102
00:07:50,414 --> 00:07:52,882
I got it. Sorry.

103
00:08:00,024 --> 00:08:03,755
Hello? Martha.

104
00:08:09,534 --> 00:08:10,865
It's Martha.

105
00:08:31,088 --> 00:08:33,852
Hi, honey. How you doing?
Did the plumber come yet?

106
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,857
Did he ever.

107
00:08:37,562 --> 00:08:41,999
I don't really wanna know about it.
Guess what I'm looking at.

108
00:08:42,066 --> 00:08:45,331
- <i>You got it? </i>
- Yeah, I got it right here.

109
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:47,970
Or I should say, I got her.

110
00:08:48,573 --> 00:08:49,801
What's she like?

111
00:08:50,074 --> 00:08:52,508
Well, she's cute.
She looks like a rabbit.

112
00:08:52,577 --> 00:08:56,240
She's white, long ears,
little pink eyes.

113
00:08:59,717 --> 00:09:02,049
Ellen doesn't know
anything about it?

114
00:09:02,286 --> 00:09:05,653
No, she doesn't think
she's gonna get one.

115
00:09:05,723 --> 00:09:07,657
See what happens if
you work here too long, Eunice?

116
00:09:07,725 --> 00:09:09,659
- Isn't she cute.
- Thank you.

117
00:09:09,727 --> 00:09:12,719
Oh, I forgot.
This arrived for you.

118
00:09:13,231 --> 00:09:15,699
- Good night, Eunice.
- Good night, Mr. Gallagher.

119
00:09:29,247 --> 00:09:31,044
Hey, Joaquin!

120
00:11:18,756 --> 00:11:21,247
Jesus fucking Christ!

121
00:11:21,359 --> 00:11:24,886
Fucking bitch!
Jesus Christ.

122
00:11:31,369 --> 00:11:33,303
It had something to do
with the electrical system.

123
00:11:33,371 --> 00:11:36,306
The whole goddamn thing blew up.
A lot of smoke.

124
00:11:36,374 --> 00:11:38,433
All right, honey,
I'll see you in a little while.

125
00:11:58,362 --> 00:12:00,922
Mr. Gallagher?
You forgot your contract.

126
00:13:08,432 --> 00:13:11,401
<i>Hello, Dan. </i>
<i>Are you surprised? </i>

127
00:13:12,436 --> 00:13:15,166
<i>This is what you've reduced me to. </i>

128
00:13:15,439 --> 00:13:17,339
<i>I guess you thought</i>
<i>you'd get away with it. </i>

129
00:13:17,441 --> 00:13:19,341
<i>Well, you can't. </i>

130
00:13:20,945 --> 00:13:24,108
<i>Because part of you</i>
<i>is growing inside of me... </i>

131
00:13:24,448 --> 00:13:27,315
<i>and that's a fact, Dan, </i>
<i>and you'd better start... </i>

132
00:13:27,451 --> 00:13:29,783
<i>learning how to deal with it. </i>

133
00:13:33,457 --> 00:13:37,154
<i>'Cause, you know, I feel you. </i>

134
00:13:37,461 --> 00:13:41,864
<i>I taste you. </i>
<i>I think you. </i>

135
00:13:41,966 --> 00:13:43,524
<i>I touch you. </i>

136
00:13:45,469 --> 00:13:47,403
<i>Can you understand? </i>

137
00:13:47,471 --> 00:13:49,029
<i>Can you? </i>

138
00:13:49,974 --> 00:13:53,466
<i>I'm just asking you... </i>

139
00:13:53,978 --> 00:13:57,880
<i>to acknowledge</i>
<i>your responsibilities. </i>

140
00:13:57,982 --> 00:14:00,450
<i>Is that so bad? </i>

141
00:14:00,484 --> 00:14:02,384
<i>I don't think so. </i>

142
00:14:02,486 --> 00:14:05,353
<i>I don't think it's unreasonable. </i>

143
00:14:05,489 --> 00:14:07,923
<i>And, you know, </i>
<i>another thing is that... </i>

144
00:14:07,992 --> 00:14:13,055
<i>you thought you could just</i>
<i>walk into my life... </i>

145
00:14:13,497 --> 00:14:14,930
<i>and turn it upside down... </i>

146
00:14:14,999 --> 00:14:17,763
<i>without a thought</i>
<i>for anyone but yourself. </i>

147
00:14:42,493 --> 00:14:44,461
<i>You know what you are, Dan? </i>

148
00:14:44,528 --> 00:14:47,463
<i>You're a cock-sucking</i>
<i>son of a bitch. </i>

149
00:14:47,531 --> 00:14:52,491
<i>I hate you. I bet</i>
<i>you don't even like girls, do you? </i>

150
00:14:52,536 --> 00:14:55,300
<i>You flaming, fucking faggot. </i>

151
00:15:48,025 --> 00:15:50,152
Daddy! Thank you!

152
00:15:56,533 --> 00:15:58,865
Like it?

153
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:56,325
<i>You thought you could just</i>
<i>walk into my life... </i>

154
00:16:56,393 --> 00:16:58,327
<i>and turn it upside down... </i>

155
00:16:58,395 --> 00:17:01,330
<i>without a thought</i>
<i>for anyone but yourself. </i>

156
00:17:01,398 --> 00:17:03,491
<i>You know what you are, Dan? </i>

157
00:17:03,901 --> 00:17:07,962
<i>You're a cock-sucking</i>
<i>son of a bitch. </i>

158
00:17:09,907 --> 00:17:11,340
<i>You are. </i>

159
00:17:11,408 --> 00:17:14,206
<i>I bet you don't</i>
<i>even like girls, do you? </i>

160
00:17:14,411 --> 00:17:16,845
<i>They probably scare you. </i>

161
00:17:16,914 --> 00:17:18,814
<i>I know I do. </i>

162
00:17:19,917 --> 00:17:22,181
<i>So you're scared of me, aren't you? </i>

163
00:17:22,419 --> 00:17:25,388
<i>You're fucking frightened of me. </i>
<i>You're afraid. </i>

164
00:17:25,422 --> 00:17:28,414
<i>You're afraid, aren't you? </i>
<i>You gutless, heartless... </i>

165
00:17:28,926 --> 00:17:30,860
<i>spineless fucking son of a bitch. </i>

166
00:17:30,928 --> 00:17:34,022
<i>I hate you. </i>
<i>You deserve everything you get... </i>

167
00:17:36,934 --> 00:17:37,832
Sorry.

168
00:17:37,935 --> 00:17:40,870
I was wondering what you
were doing up so late.

169
00:17:40,938 --> 00:17:42,838
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

170
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:46,876
It's okay. I was just listening
to a deposition and couldn't sleep.

171
00:17:46,944 --> 00:17:49,845
Come on.
I'm gonna give you a back rub.

172
00:17:49,947 --> 00:17:53,041
- A back rub?
- Brandy, a back rub.

173
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:55,850
You won't know what hit you.

174
00:17:55,953 --> 00:17:57,511
Sounds good.

175
00:18:01,959 --> 00:18:04,325
<i>My client wants it stopped. </i>

176
00:18:05,963 --> 00:18:07,897
<i>Hejust wants an end</i>
<i>to the harassment. </i>

177
00:18:07,965 --> 00:18:10,661
<i>He's positive it was this woman</i>
<i>who trashed the car? </i>

178
00:18:11,468 --> 00:18:12,901
Yes, of course.

179
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:16,064
- Any witnesses?
- No.

180
00:18:17,975 --> 00:18:20,409
He's welcome to file a complaint,
if it'd make him feel better.

181
00:18:20,477 --> 00:18:23,173
There's not a lot you can do
without proof.

182
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,244
Look, Lieutenant, this woman
is completely irrational.

183
00:18:26,316 --> 00:18:28,216
There's no telling
what she could do.

184
00:18:28,485 --> 00:18:31,352
We can't go around arresting people
for what they might do. You know that.

185
00:18:31,488 --> 00:18:36,016
I'm not asking you to arrest her.
He simply...

186
00:18:39,496 --> 00:18:41,396
He wants her warned.

187
00:18:44,001 --> 00:18:46,265
Well, we could talk to her.

188
00:18:46,503 --> 00:18:49,336
It may make things public.
He's not gonna like that.

189
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:52,431
It may even aggravate
the situation with the girl.

190
00:18:52,509 --> 00:18:54,033
How's that?

191
00:18:54,511 --> 00:18:58,447
Whatever resentment she's feeling,
she probably got it out of her system.

192
00:18:58,515 --> 00:19:01,416
And any action we take
could provoke her.

193
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:05,352
What if she didn't get it
out of her system? What then?

194
00:19:07,024 --> 00:19:10,425
You have to catch her in the act.
Then we can bring charges.

195
00:19:11,028 --> 00:19:13,553
Well, you say he just has to
sit there and take it?

196
00:19:13,964 --> 00:19:17,661
It's his bed. Afraid
he's gonna have to lie in it.

197
00:19:29,546 --> 00:19:31,446
Come on.

198
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:45,494
Come on, Ellen.
We're going to Grandma's.

199
00:19:49,566 --> 00:19:53,093
Come on, Quince.
Quincy, come on. Hurry up.

200
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:56,004
Come on. Get on in.
Hurry up.

201
00:19:56,073 --> 00:19:58,564
Watch his tail, sweetie.
Make him sit down.

202
00:20:14,658 --> 00:20:16,023
See you didn't get your car back.

203
00:20:16,093 --> 00:20:19,426
No, it's a total write-off.
The electrical system's just shot.

204
00:20:19,596 --> 00:20:22,326
Extraordinary, those foreign cars.

205
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:24,533
- Here you are, dear.
- Oh, thank you.

206
00:20:24,601 --> 00:20:27,468
- Wanna try again, sweetie?
- Okay.

207
00:20:28,105 --> 00:20:31,040
Okay. So?

208
00:20:31,108 --> 00:20:36,944
Dear Priscilla, Miles asked me
to ask you to marry him.

209
00:20:37,614 --> 00:20:39,047
Very good.

210
00:20:39,116 --> 00:20:42,984
You wanna do it one more time.
Do it with your hat and do the bow.

211
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,850
So when you actually do it,
you know what you're doing.

212
00:20:46,189 --> 00:20:48,089
Let me see your bow.

213
00:20:50,694 --> 00:20:52,025
And what do you say?

214
00:20:52,629 --> 00:20:57,396
Dear Priscilla, Miles asked me
to ask you to marry him.

215
00:20:57,634 --> 00:20:59,033
Very good.

216
00:21:00,637 --> 00:21:02,195
Come here.

217
00:21:05,142 --> 00:21:06,575
That was good.

218
00:21:06,643 --> 00:21:09,407
- Thank you.
- That was really good.

219
00:21:09,646 --> 00:21:11,546
That was so good.

220
00:21:15,152 --> 00:21:17,086
- I love you.
- I love you too.

221
00:21:17,154 --> 00:21:18,712
Thank you, darling.

222
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,738
Come on, Quincy.

223
00:23:09,032 --> 00:23:10,260
Daddy!

224
00:23:10,367 --> 00:23:11,959
What?

225
00:23:15,472 --> 00:23:16,632
Whitey's gone!

226
00:23:39,996 --> 00:23:43,864
It's all right, darling.
It's gonna be okay, sweetie.

227
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,230
You should try to get some sleep.

228
00:24:12,028 --> 00:24:14,656
- She okay?
- She's asleep.

229
00:24:18,034 --> 00:24:20,468
- Did you call the police?
- Not yet, no.

230
00:24:20,537 --> 00:24:21,765
Why not?

231
00:24:25,542 --> 00:24:27,703
Honey, we gotta talk.

232
00:24:35,552 --> 00:24:37,577
What is it?

233
00:24:39,055 --> 00:24:41,023
I know who did this.

234
00:24:43,059 --> 00:24:44,287
You do?

235
00:24:45,028 --> 00:24:46,290
Who?

236
00:24:46,563 --> 00:24:48,724
Remember the girl who...

237
00:24:49,065 --> 00:24:51,499
came to the apartment?

238
00:24:51,568 --> 00:24:54,503
The one I met
in the Japanese restaurant?

239
00:24:56,573 --> 00:24:59,133
The one with the blond hair.

240
00:25:06,583 --> 00:25:08,244
You're scaring me.

241
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:16,524
What is it?

242
00:25:16,593 --> 00:25:18,788
Did you have an affair with her?

243
00:25:19,563 --> 00:25:21,224
Yes.

244
00:25:42,152 --> 00:25:44,052
I am so sorry.

245
00:25:45,622 --> 00:25:50,889
The last thing I ever wanted to do
was to hurt you.

246
00:25:57,634 --> 00:26:00,364
Are you in love with her?

247
00:26:02,138 --> 00:26:06,370
No, it was one night.
It didn't mean anything.

248
00:26:17,153 --> 00:26:21,749
What has it got to do
with what's happened?

249
00:26:26,162 --> 00:26:27,424
She's pregnant.

250
00:26:29,666 --> 00:26:33,625
She's... It's yours?

251
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:38,129
I don't know. That's what she says.
Honey, listen to me.

252
00:26:38,742 --> 00:26:40,607
Get out!
I want you out of here!

253
00:26:40,677 --> 00:26:42,872
I want you out of this house,
and I want you out now!

254
00:26:43,179 --> 00:26:45,079
How could you do this?
I hate you!

255
00:26:45,649 --> 00:26:48,618
- Honey, you don't understand.
- I don't wanna hear it!

256
00:26:48,685 --> 00:26:51,620
- I don't wanna hear it!
- Please, just listen to me.

257
00:26:51,688 --> 00:26:53,155
Please, please, listen.

258
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:55,590
What is the matter with you?

259
00:28:06,262 --> 00:28:08,730
Dan. What a pleasant surprise.

260
00:28:09,766 --> 00:28:13,759
It's over, Alex. It's all finished.
I told Beth. She knows all about it.

261
00:28:15,271 --> 00:28:19,537
<i>Sure. </i>
<i>You haven't got the balls. </i>

262
00:28:19,776 --> 00:28:21,903
Why don't you speak to her.

263
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:26,248
Why would I wanna talk to her?

264
00:28:38,294 --> 00:28:40,228
This is Beth Gallagher.

265
00:28:40,296 --> 00:28:43,891
If you ever come near my family again,
I'll kill you. You understand?

266
00:29:11,327 --> 00:29:14,194
That's the last one.
I mean it.

267
00:29:31,848 --> 00:29:33,782
Hello?

268
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:35,408
Hi, Daddy.

269
00:29:37,854 --> 00:29:40,152
When are you coming home?

270
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:48,388
Honey, I don't know.
How are you doing?

271
00:29:48,865 --> 00:29:50,423
Good.

272
00:29:58,441 --> 00:30:00,807
Grandpa taught me a new card trick.

273
00:30:00,877 --> 00:30:03,675
Oh, did he?
The one with the jacks?

274
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,280
No, the one with kings.

275
00:30:07,884 --> 00:30:09,442
Good.

276
00:30:12,889 --> 00:30:14,516
I won't.

277
00:30:16,893 --> 00:30:18,451
Good.

278
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:26,994
How's Mommy?
Send her my love?

279
00:30:27,403 --> 00:30:29,837
Okay. Good-bye.

280
00:30:29,906 --> 00:30:32,101
Daddy?

281
00:30:32,408 --> 00:30:34,876
Call me tomorrow.

282
00:30:35,912 --> 00:30:37,345
I will. I promise.

283
00:30:37,413 --> 00:30:39,381
You be sure
you tell Mommy I called?

284
00:30:39,916 --> 00:30:42,350
I will.

285
00:30:42,418 --> 00:30:44,283
Love you a lot too.

286
00:31:33,469 --> 00:31:36,199
Hi, Mrs. Gallagher.
Did you forget something?

287
00:31:36,472 --> 00:31:38,406
- I came to get Ellen.
- Ellen?

288
00:31:38,474 --> 00:31:40,374
I thought you picked her up already.

289
00:31:41,477 --> 00:31:43,377
Well, I'm sure
she's left already.

290
00:31:44,814 --> 00:31:47,408
Betty, is Ellen in here with you?

291
00:31:47,483 --> 00:31:49,383
- She's gone home already.
- Are you sure?

292
00:31:49,485 --> 00:31:51,919
I'm positive. She's not inside
and she's not in the playground.

293
00:31:51,988 --> 00:31:55,048
- I thought you picked her up.
- Who did pick her up?

294
00:31:55,491 --> 00:31:57,391
Don't worry.
She can't have gone far.

295
00:31:58,494 --> 00:32:00,792
- You don't understand.
- I'll check her locker.

296
00:32:06,002 --> 00:32:07,936
Alicia, where's Ellen?

297
00:32:08,004 --> 00:32:09,369
She's gone.

298
00:32:12,008 --> 00:32:13,703
Call the police!

299
00:32:21,851 --> 00:32:24,581
Please let her be all right.
Please.

300
00:32:26,522 --> 00:32:27,819
Oh, Christ.

301
00:32:32,428 --> 00:32:34,089
Where are you?

302
00:33:57,146 --> 00:33:59,671
Where are you?

303
00:34:25,141 --> 00:34:27,405
- Bye-bye, Ellen.
- Bye.

304
00:34:30,146 --> 00:34:31,511
Can I have a kiss?

305
00:34:47,163 --> 00:34:49,097
Excuse me. I'm looking
for a patient named Gallagher.

306
00:34:49,165 --> 00:34:50,655
I'm her husband.

307
00:34:51,167 --> 00:34:53,601
Room 22 at the end of the corridor.

308
00:34:53,669 --> 00:34:56,604
- Is she gonna be okay?
- Yeah, she'll be fine.

309
00:34:56,672 --> 00:34:59,607
She was very lucky.
It might've been a lot worse.

310
00:34:59,675 --> 00:35:01,506
Thank you.
Hi, baby.

311
00:35:01,677 --> 00:35:05,135
Oh, God, I missed you.
I missed you, honey.

312
00:35:05,681 --> 00:35:08,616
Are you okay?
Did you see Mommy yet?

313
00:35:08,684 --> 00:35:10,618
- Yeah.
- Oh, good.

314
00:35:10,686 --> 00:35:13,177
You stay here with Granny.
I'm gonna go see Mommy.

315
00:35:42,218 --> 00:35:44,118
You're gonna be okay.

316
00:40:38,314 --> 00:40:40,748
I came in before.
I tried to explain the situation.

317
00:40:40,816 --> 00:40:42,875
You didn't wanna listen to me.
Now, the woman took my kid.

318
00:40:43,319 --> 00:40:45,753
That's kidnapping, right?
Am I right?

319
00:40:45,821 --> 00:40:47,982
My wife's in the hospital.
She could've been killed.

320
00:40:48,324 --> 00:40:52,283
- If you're not gonna do something...
- Take it easy. You don't have to shout.

321
00:40:55,831 --> 00:40:57,992
Okay, what are you gonna do?

322
00:40:58,834 --> 00:41:02,634
We'll tell New York to pick her up
and bring her in for questioning.

323
00:41:07,343 --> 00:41:09,903
Okay, then I'm...

324
00:41:10,346 --> 00:41:14,783
I'm gonna go to the hospital
tomorrow, pick my wife up.

325
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:17,717
And hopefully...

326
00:41:17,853 --> 00:41:22,449
I'll be home for the weekend
if you need to talk to me.

327
00:41:29,865 --> 00:41:31,423
Thank you, Lieutenant.

328
00:41:35,371 --> 00:41:37,305
You're welcome.

329
00:41:55,891 --> 00:41:58,519
How's that feel?
Good and warm?

330
00:42:01,897 --> 00:42:05,663
- You all cozy?
- Is Mommy gonna be all right?

331
00:42:06,735 --> 00:42:08,828
Mommy's gonna be fine, honey.

332
00:42:08,904 --> 00:42:10,804
She's gonna be fine.

333
00:42:11,407 --> 00:42:14,001
Are you going to stay with us?

334
00:42:16,912 --> 00:42:19,005
I'm gonna stay with you, honey.

335
00:42:22,418 --> 00:42:24,318
Now, you go to sleep, okay?

336
00:42:27,923 --> 00:42:29,481
Good night, doll.

337
00:42:31,927 --> 00:42:33,224
Forever?

338
00:42:35,931 --> 00:42:37,262
I promise, honey.

339
00:42:57,953 --> 00:43:02,322
You mean the detectives in Manhattan
have no idea where she's gone?

340
00:43:02,458 --> 00:43:04,358
They don't know where she is?

341
00:43:17,473 --> 00:43:19,907
No, I see.

342
00:43:19,975 --> 00:43:22,671
If you get any more information,
be sure and let me know, Lieutenant.

343
00:43:22,978 --> 00:43:25,310
Thank you very much, sir.
Good night.

344
00:43:41,997 --> 00:43:45,057
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

345
00:43:45,534 --> 00:43:49,334
- How does the arm feel?
- It hurts.

346
00:43:50,039 --> 00:43:52,166
I'll get you some more painkillers.

347
00:44:16,565 --> 00:44:17,497
Thanks.

348
00:44:17,566 --> 00:44:19,864
Now, you just holler if
you need anything else, all right?

349
00:44:20,569 --> 00:44:23,003
I'd love a cup of tea.

350
00:44:23,572 --> 00:44:25,369
You got it.

351
00:46:05,674 --> 00:46:07,938
What are you doing here?

352
00:46:13,582 --> 00:46:16,016
Why are you here?

353
00:46:20,222 --> 00:46:21,780
He tried...

354
00:46:22,691 --> 00:46:25,319
to say good-bye to me last night.

355
00:46:26,261 --> 00:46:29,128
But he couldn't because...

356
00:46:29,198 --> 00:46:31,666
he and I feel
the same way about each other.

357
00:46:35,704 --> 00:46:38,969
Do you know how it is when you
meet somebody for the first time?

358
00:46:42,110 --> 00:46:45,375
And you get this instant attraction.

359
00:46:54,223 --> 00:46:56,350
And don't you think
I understand what you're doing?

360
00:46:56,725 --> 00:46:59,660
You're trying to move him
into the country...

361
00:46:59,728 --> 00:47:02,196
and you're keeping him
away from me.

362
00:47:04,299 --> 00:47:07,632
And you're playing happy family.

363
00:47:07,703 --> 00:47:10,103
Aren't you?

364
00:47:10,739 --> 00:47:14,573
You wouldn't understand that
because you're so selfish.

365
00:47:18,247 --> 00:47:21,375
He told me about you.
He told me about you.

366
00:47:21,650 --> 00:47:23,880
He was very honest.

367
00:47:36,265 --> 00:47:37,698
If you weren't so stupid,
you'd know that.

368
00:47:37,766 --> 00:47:40,735
But you're so stupid.
You're a stupid, selfish bitch!

369
00:47:42,771 --> 00:47:44,295
You're a stupid, selfish bitch!
