1
00:02:34,432 --> 00:02:36,593
- Paulie, how's it look?
- Snitch says the cop's body's...

2
00:02:36,667 --> 00:02:39,932
about 300 yards down
in the abandoned tunnel.

3
00:02:40,004 --> 00:02:42,370
- Howie?
- Right behind you, Captain.

4
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,874
Keep back till I process the scene.

5
00:04:01,685 --> 00:04:03,710
Watch out below!

6
00:05:14,525 --> 00:05:18,757
- So where the hell is the car?
- I don't know.

7
00:05:18,829 --> 00:05:22,697
- That's the last time I take a red-eye.
- Maybe we can take a cab.

8
00:05:23,601 --> 00:05:25,592
I'm gonna fire this son of a bitch.

9
00:05:25,669 --> 00:05:27,534
He's always got an excuse.

10
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:35,979
Come on, we'll be home
before you know it, hmm?

11
00:05:36,046 --> 00:05:37,479
Yeah.

12
00:06:16,987 --> 00:06:21,083
Excuse me. Excuse me,
I think you're going the wrong way.

13
00:06:23,994 --> 00:06:29,432
Honey, honey, wake up. We're lost,
or he's taking us for a ride.

14
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,832
We're in the middle of nowhere.

15
00:06:31,902 --> 00:06:34,427
Where the hell you going?
I said Fifth Avenue.

16
00:06:37,908 --> 00:06:40,433
We're not tourists here, man.

17
00:06:40,511 --> 00:06:42,843
Hey, where are you going?

18
00:06:50,654 --> 00:06:52,588
Let us out.
Stop the car.

19
00:06:54,258 --> 00:06:57,193
- Stop this car, man!
- Stop the car!

20
00:07:07,705 --> 00:07:08,797
Shit.

21
00:07:08,872 --> 00:07:12,273
- Oh, my God.
- Son of a bitch.

22
00:07:12,343 --> 00:07:14,743
Stop the goddamn car!

23
00:07:24,355 --> 00:07:25,822
- Stop it, please.
- Stop the car.

24
00:07:27,124 --> 00:07:30,616
Stop this car, goddamn it!
Stop this car!

25
00:07:34,098 --> 00:07:36,123
Good morning.

26
00:07:37,368 --> 00:07:39,802
You look a little dehydrated.

27
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:43,067
- How about some juice?
- How about two fingers of vodka?

28
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,937
Isn't it a little early for vodka?

29
00:07:45,776 --> 00:07:49,075
Time, as you well know,
is a relative consideration, Thelma.

30
00:07:49,146 --> 00:07:50,773
-Juice.
- Vodka.

31
00:07:54,618 --> 00:07:57,143
- Coming!
-Join me in a drink, Richard?

32
00:07:57,221 --> 00:08:00,657
I'd love to, but a med tech with
liquor on his breath, I think not.

33
00:08:00,724 --> 00:08:03,522
- Thanks.
- So, how are you?

34
00:08:03,594 --> 00:08:06,495
I'm better than
your heart-pacing gear.

35
00:08:06,563 --> 00:08:10,055
Every time I'm here, it's skewed further
out of spec. You need a new unit.

36
00:08:10,134 --> 00:08:12,125
I really need a new body.

37
00:08:12,202 --> 00:08:14,136
I'm afraid I can't help you
with that.

38
00:08:14,204 --> 00:08:17,264
- I'll bring you a new unit tomorrow.
- Okay.

39
00:08:17,341 --> 00:08:20,037
- This one'll be stable till then.
- Thank you, Richard.

40
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:23,876
- Take it easy.
- I'll take it anyway I can get it.

41
00:08:24,948 --> 00:08:27,883
- How's he doing this morning?
- He asked for vodka again.

42
00:08:27,951 --> 00:08:30,715
- Give him any?
- No!

43
00:08:30,788 --> 00:08:33,621
- Good morning, Doctor.
- Hi, Richard.

44
00:08:33,691 --> 00:08:39,391
Hey, would you look at this!
Peregrine falcon. Am I right?

45
00:08:39,463 --> 00:08:42,455
Yep.
He likes cripples.

46
00:08:44,001 --> 00:08:46,469
Yeah, there was a piece about them
in the Times the other day...

47
00:08:46,537 --> 00:08:48,471
nesting all over the city.

48
00:08:48,539 --> 00:08:51,975
Something to do with architecture
of all these old buildings.

49
00:08:52,042 --> 00:08:54,806
I thought he liked my company.

50
00:08:59,216 --> 00:09:02,583
They're a little shy.
Don't take it personally, Barry.

51
00:09:02,653 --> 00:09:05,554
- Drink, Doc?
- No, thanks, Thelma, I'm fine.

52
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:09,256
Bed mode.

53
00:09:17,301 --> 00:09:19,701
- Got vodka in there?
- No.

54
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:22,204
You ain't getting any either.

55
00:09:22,272 --> 00:09:25,764
All right, I'll let you guys talk.

56
00:09:28,078 --> 00:09:32,447
So, Linc, you can imagine how much
sleep I've gotten the past few days...

57
00:09:32,516 --> 00:09:33,949
considering your request.

58
00:09:34,017 --> 00:09:38,181
That's funny. Since I made my decision,
I've been sleeping like a baby.

59
00:09:38,255 --> 00:09:41,691
After all you have survived,
beat all the odds...

60
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:44,319
you know as well as I do, there's work
on nerve regeneration every day.

61
00:09:44,395 --> 00:09:49,992
One finger, two shoulders and a brain.
That's all I have, Barry.

62
00:09:51,402 --> 00:09:54,200
These dysreflexia seizures
are occurring more frequently.

63
00:09:54,271 --> 00:09:58,435
Build-up of fluid in my spine
is a degenerative condition.

64
00:09:58,509 --> 00:10:03,412
We both know I'm waiting for the seizure
that's gonna make me a vegetable.

65
00:10:04,648 --> 00:10:07,082
I don't wanna be a vegetable, Barry.

66
00:10:09,353 --> 00:10:13,050
I wanna make the final transition
on my own terms.

67
00:10:15,526 --> 00:10:17,426
I'll get it done
with or without you.

68
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:22,695
Oh, yeah,
I suppose you would.

69
00:10:27,671 --> 00:10:29,764
So?

70
00:10:33,944 --> 00:10:36,071
- Okay.
- Okay what?

71
00:10:40,184 --> 00:10:42,448
Okay, I'll assist you...

72
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:44,578
in your final transition.

73
00:10:44,655 --> 00:10:47,647
- What about today?
- Linc, preparations have to be made.

74
00:10:47,724 --> 00:10:49,316
This is not a flu shot.

75
00:10:49,393 --> 00:10:51,861
My business is in order.
My bags are packed.

76
00:10:51,929 --> 00:10:56,457
Besides, I've got a medical conference
to go to. I've got a plane to catch.

77
00:10:56,533 --> 00:10:58,467
You're lying.

78
00:10:59,269 --> 00:11:00,531
When do you get back?

79
00:11:02,172 --> 00:11:03,332
Sunday.

80
00:11:03,407 --> 00:11:06,934
Okay. Sunday.

81
00:11:10,347 --> 00:11:14,044
- I'll see you then.
- Get out before you change your mind.

82
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,947
Don't bother to get up.
I'll show myself out.

83
00:11:19,022 --> 00:11:21,388
Yeah, I'll race you to the door.

84
00:11:25,796 --> 00:11:28,162
You are...

85
00:11:28,232 --> 00:11:30,666
a very good friend.

86
00:12:21,118 --> 00:12:22,210
Amelia.

87
00:12:23,854 --> 00:12:28,052
- Hey.
- Hey. Morning.

88
00:12:29,026 --> 00:12:30,459
You okay?

89
00:12:30,527 --> 00:12:33,462
Yeah, I'm fine.
I just couldn't sleep.

90
00:12:37,601 --> 00:12:40,297
- What time is it?
- It's early.

91
00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:51,677
I'm gonna be late for work.
I gotta shower.

92
00:12:51,748 --> 00:12:55,149
- No, you don't. Stay here.
- I gotta go.

93
00:13:08,165 --> 00:13:12,397
- Hey, I'll make breakfast?
- No, thanks, I'm gonna be late.

94
00:13:12,469 --> 00:13:15,438
Another
slam-bam-thank-you-ma'am, huh?

95
00:13:18,475 --> 00:13:20,306
Look--

96
00:13:21,244 --> 00:13:23,178
My therapist tells me...

97
00:13:23,246 --> 00:13:25,407
I might not be getting what I need
out of this relationship.

98
00:13:26,483 --> 00:13:30,920
What are we doing here?
I think we make a great couple.

99
00:13:32,689 --> 00:13:36,352
You know where I stand on this.
You know what I want.

100
00:13:36,426 --> 00:13:39,691
Steve, we've been through this.

101
00:13:39,763 --> 00:13:44,200
I care about you. You know that.
I can't make a commitment.

102
00:13:53,877 --> 00:13:56,107
Go to work then.

103
00:13:56,179 --> 00:13:59,273
Go ahead.
You're gonna be late.

104
00:14:11,561 --> 00:14:13,961
So, Amelia, is it true
you're quitting the cops?

105
00:14:14,031 --> 00:14:16,591
- No, transferring to Youth Services.
- You lucky fuck.

106
00:14:16,667 --> 00:14:18,658
You must have one hell
of a rabbi downtown.

107
00:14:18,735 --> 00:14:21,260
- We're gonna miss you here.
- Three-post-eleven here.

108
00:14:21,338 --> 00:14:24,796
- Frightened child at Amtrak site.
- I'm a block away. I'll take it.

109
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:27,639
Some kid found something
over at the tracks.

110
00:14:27,711 --> 00:14:30,305
- Finish eating. I'll check it out.
- See you, kid.

111
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:00,241
Three-post-eleven,
anything further on that ten-ten?

112
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:01,743
Nothing yet.

113
00:15:04,314 --> 00:15:05,781
Wait, I think I see him.

114
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:08,841
Are you the one
who called the police?

115
00:15:52,696 --> 00:15:54,129
Wait there, okay?

116
00:17:00,163 --> 00:17:03,655
- Are you out of your mind?
- Shut off the engine, all right?

117
00:17:03,733 --> 00:17:05,667
There's been a homicide.
I can't let you through.

118
00:17:19,015 --> 00:17:21,313
- My name is Amelia. What's yours?
- Chris.

119
00:17:21,384 --> 00:17:26,083
Chris, hey. I got a job foryou.
Here's some money.

120
00:17:26,156 --> 00:17:30,490
I need you to buy me one of those
cheapo cardboard cameras...

121
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,289
the ones you can throw away.

122
00:17:32,362 --> 00:17:34,125
Okay. Fast as you can.

123
00:17:41,204 --> 00:17:42,466
Three-post-eleven to central.

124
00:19:32,649 --> 00:19:36,380
Get Amtrak to send a bus over here.
Get these passengers out of here.

125
00:19:37,454 --> 00:19:39,388
Captain Cheney, Detective Solomon.

126
00:19:40,557 --> 00:19:43,253
- Anything else?
- First officer on the scene is there.

127
00:19:43,326 --> 00:19:47,456
I found strange stuff near the body. I
collected it before it was washed away.

128
00:19:51,568 --> 00:19:54,162
- I also took some pictures.
- Thanks.

129
00:19:54,237 --> 00:19:59,334
- You the one who stopped the train?
- I thought it would disturb evidence.

130
00:19:59,409 --> 00:20:03,607
So why not shut down Grand Central while
you're at it, hmm, Patrolman Donahue?

131
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,342
- Is that right?
- Donaghy.

132
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:09,180
- A rookie, I take it?
- No, sir.

133
00:20:09,252 --> 00:20:11,277
Pretty dumb.

134
00:20:12,522 --> 00:20:15,013
Captain, guess who
the vic turns out to be.

135
00:20:15,091 --> 00:20:18,083
- Talk to me.
- Alan fucking Rubin.

136
00:20:22,265 --> 00:20:25,530
Listen, I don't want anybody
in this area except for the crime unit.

137
00:20:25,602 --> 00:20:27,797
- Okay?
- Okay, Detective.

138
00:20:37,047 --> 00:20:39,106
Knight to H-6. Check.

139
00:20:41,051 --> 00:20:45,181
- You got company. Cops.
- Tell 'em I'm busy.

140
00:20:45,255 --> 00:20:48,486
- They said it was urgent.
- Tell 'em I'm out running.

141
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:51,118
She's too polite for that, Linc.

142
00:20:51,194 --> 00:20:53,128
Hey, looky who's here.

143
00:20:56,566 --> 00:21:00,900
- I got a serious situation.
- It's going around, Paulie.

144
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:02,904
Chief Murphy sent me.

145
00:21:04,808 --> 00:21:06,969
The good chief.

146
00:21:07,043 --> 00:21:11,446
Hear about the couple at the airport,
got in a taxi yesterday morning?

147
00:21:11,514 --> 00:21:13,505
- Never made it home.
- We don't watch the news anymore.

148
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:17,075
He used to read four papers a day,
tape all the news shows.

149
00:21:17,153 --> 00:21:19,314
Yeah, and now I just hit
the rewind button. A-3.

150
00:21:20,423 --> 00:21:21,685
Things never change.

151
00:21:21,758 --> 00:21:24,750
Yeah, well, that was Alan Rubin
and his wife in that taxi.

152
00:21:25,662 --> 00:21:28,187
Found him dead, buried,
shot in the face...

153
00:21:28,264 --> 00:21:32,257
hand sticking out of the ground with his
wife's wedding band on his finger...

154
00:21:32,335 --> 00:21:34,166
which was skinned to the bone.

155
00:21:34,237 --> 00:21:36,102
She's still missing.

156
00:21:36,172 --> 00:21:38,197
Excuse me while you catch up, okay?

157
00:21:38,274 --> 00:21:43,712
Don't go too far, Thelma. These nice
gentlemen are leaving in 30 seconds.

158
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:46,874
Sounds like you got yourself
an open-and-shut there, Paulie.

159
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:48,542
- I don't think so.
- Yeah?

160
00:21:48,618 --> 00:21:50,711
A man worth millions found dead...

161
00:21:50,787 --> 00:21:54,689
with his wife's wedding band
on his mutilated hand.

162
00:21:54,757 --> 00:21:56,748
What does that tell you?

163
00:21:56,826 --> 00:21:59,420
The doer is saying he's got her.

164
00:21:59,496 --> 00:22:02,590
He's probably contacting the family
right now making a ransom demand.

165
00:22:02,665 --> 00:22:06,066
- I would've been paged if he had.
- Check your batteries.

166
00:22:06,803 --> 00:22:08,464
It's definitely a ransom.

167
00:22:10,406 --> 00:22:13,068
Excuse me, Mr. Rhyme,
Kenneth Solomon.

168
00:22:13,143 --> 00:22:15,907
I've read all your books--
Scene of the Crime...

169
00:22:15,979 --> 00:22:18,971
at least a dozen times.

170
00:22:19,048 --> 00:22:20,481
It's great to actually meet you.

171
00:22:22,118 --> 00:22:25,918
- Where do you find these guys?
- They wanna work with the best.

172
00:22:25,989 --> 00:22:30,892
I guess now you're gonna ask me to
discuss the crime scene with you, huh?

173
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,485
In fact, we got a bunch
of physical evidence...

174
00:22:33,563 --> 00:22:35,997
that doesn't exactly make sense.

175
00:22:36,065 --> 00:22:39,000
Some seriously weird stuff.
It's in the report.

176
00:22:42,238 --> 00:22:43,466
You okay?

177
00:22:46,142 --> 00:22:47,837
- You okay?
- Out! Now!

178
00:22:47,911 --> 00:22:51,347
- Anything we can do?
- Asses outta here now!

179
00:22:51,414 --> 00:22:54,645
We're gonna get you some air.
Come on, breathe for me, Linc.

180
00:22:56,252 --> 00:22:57,844
I said, out!

181
00:22:57,921 --> 00:23:01,948
Come on, deep breaths.
Deep breaths, come on.

182
00:23:02,025 --> 00:23:05,927
Deep breaths. I'm getting a B.P. on you.
Come on now, breathe.

183
00:23:05,995 --> 00:23:08,862
Look at me. Breathe.

184
00:23:11,334 --> 00:23:13,802
Look at me. Deep breaths.

185
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:16,430
Come on, come on.
You've got to take this oxygen.

186
00:23:16,506 --> 00:23:19,168
Come on, Rhyme,
stay with me.

187
00:23:19,242 --> 00:23:22,905
Come on, you can do it.
Don't go out on me now.

188
00:23:22,979 --> 00:23:24,913
Come on, look at me.

189
00:23:55,278 --> 00:23:56,802
You okay?

190
00:23:56,879 --> 00:24:01,339
I would be okay if your powers
of resuscitation were less adept.

191
00:24:02,418 --> 00:24:04,818
Not on my shift, all right.

192
00:24:04,887 --> 00:24:07,515
If you have a problem with that,
you just fire my ass.

193
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:11,026
You know I provide generously for you
in my will. Keep that in mind.

194
00:24:11,094 --> 00:24:16,054
Rhyme, I'm not interested
in having this conversation. Okay?

195
00:24:16,132 --> 00:24:20,228
Okay.
Crime scene report Sellitto left--

196
00:24:20,303 --> 00:24:23,568
would you load those photos
in the viewer for me?

197
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,073
View scan.

198
00:24:31,114 --> 00:24:34,049
Okay, let's take a look
at what we got here.

199
00:24:35,518 --> 00:24:39,386
Where it says location--
Now, what's that?

200
00:24:39,455 --> 00:24:42,015
What's it say about that newspaper?

201
00:24:42,091 --> 00:24:47,119
''Newspaper found beneath a coarse-thread
hex bolt with 4:00 p.m. circled on it.''

202
00:24:47,196 --> 00:24:48,288
4:00 p.m.

203
00:24:49,532 --> 00:24:51,124
Zoom.

204
00:24:55,571 --> 00:24:59,098
What about the little piece of paper?
What's the number on it?

205
00:24:59,175 --> 00:25:03,669
- Torn book page with 119 on it.
- 119, 4:00 p.m.

206
00:25:11,921 --> 00:25:15,357
- What's today's date?
- Today's November 9.

207
00:25:15,425 --> 00:25:19,521
Phone mode. Sellitto, Paulie.
Call.

208
00:25:24,233 --> 00:25:25,723
What?

209
00:25:27,637 --> 00:25:31,630
Sad fact is, a huge percentage
of inner-city kids...

210
00:25:31,708 --> 00:25:36,873
are having their first drug experiences
at the fifth grade level.

211
00:25:36,946 --> 00:25:41,974
Now, here are some of the drugs
they'll most likely be offered.

212
00:25:44,921 --> 00:25:46,548
Marijuana.

213
00:25:46,622 --> 00:25:50,524
Wouldn't you like to get your hands
on that briefcase?

214
00:25:50,593 --> 00:25:53,460
Barbiturates, amphetamines.

215
00:25:54,197 --> 00:25:55,630
Cocaine.

216
00:25:57,033 --> 00:25:58,728
Rock cocaine.

217
00:26:08,344 --> 00:26:11,780
- What is this about?
- Do you know who Lincoln Rhyme is?

218
00:26:11,848 --> 00:26:13,782
- Textbook guy?
- Yeah.

219
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:17,581
- What does that have to do with me?
- You'll find out.

220
00:26:21,157 --> 00:26:24,126
Come on in.
They're right in there.

221
00:26:26,896 --> 00:26:28,796
A patrol cop took these pictures?

222
00:26:28,865 --> 00:26:31,800
Yeah, first one on the scene.
It started to rain.

223
00:26:31,868 --> 00:26:33,130
Smart guy.

224
00:26:33,202 --> 00:26:36,638
Also had the balls to stop an Amtrak
from running over the crime scene.

225
00:26:36,706 --> 00:26:39,300
Here she is now.
Officer Donahoe...

226
00:26:39,375 --> 00:26:41,468
meet Lincoln Rhyme.

227
00:26:41,544 --> 00:26:42,977
Donaghy.

228
00:26:47,083 --> 00:26:48,948
You took some terrific
photographs, Officer.

229
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:54,388
- You know who I am?
- I read your manual at the academy.

230
00:26:55,124 --> 00:26:58,457
- What'd you think of it?
- I'm not a book critic, sir.

231
00:26:59,362 --> 00:27:02,354
- But you found it useful?
- Yeah, I guess so.

232
00:27:02,432 --> 00:27:04,866
Guess so? Sure, you did.
You stopped that train.

233
00:27:04,934 --> 00:27:06,868
Photos you took.

234
00:27:08,438 --> 00:27:11,202
I'd say you have a natural instinct
for forensics.

235
00:27:11,274 --> 00:27:13,208
So what do we got, Paulie?

236
00:27:15,244 --> 00:27:18,805
We have footprints, size ten,
thanks to Officer Donaghy...

237
00:27:18,881 --> 00:27:21,406
using a dollar bill
to establish scale.

238
00:27:21,484 --> 00:27:24,419
We have asbestos on the track bed
where there shouldn't be any...

239
00:27:24,487 --> 00:27:28,014
and an iron bolt holding down
a piece of paper...

240
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:31,218
with a book page with 119
written on it.

241
00:27:31,294 --> 00:27:34,195
Decaying oxidation on the bolt's head,
but not on the thread...

242
00:27:34,263 --> 00:27:38,131
which says to me that someone
removed it from somewhere else...

243
00:27:38,201 --> 00:27:39,634
and placed it there recently.

244
00:27:39,702 --> 00:27:42,865
Wouldn't you agree, Officer?

245
00:27:48,578 --> 00:27:51,547
Paulie, I'm convinced
that this crime scene was staged.

246
00:27:51,614 --> 00:27:54,412
- Perp's trying to tell us something.
- What the fuck you saying?

247
00:27:54,484 --> 00:27:57,578
Book page 11.
11/9-- That's today date.

248
00:27:57,653 --> 00:28:01,248
- Newspaper, 4:00 p.m. What time is it?
- 12:15.

249
00:28:02,792 --> 00:28:04,054
She's alive.

250
00:28:04,126 --> 00:28:07,584
- And he's gonna kill her at 4:00.
- P.m.

251
00:28:09,999 --> 00:28:11,694
We have your interest yet, Officer?

252
00:28:15,171 --> 00:28:19,471
- I want you to work the case with us.
- It's not my area.

253
00:28:20,376 --> 00:28:22,776
Are you being modest...

254
00:28:22,845 --> 00:28:25,405
or are you a little uneasy
about doing some real police work?

255
00:28:27,083 --> 00:28:30,382
- Excuse me?
- What department you work in, Officer?

256
00:28:30,453 --> 00:28:33,889
Youth Services Division.
I picked her up at orientation.

257
00:28:33,956 --> 00:28:35,548
I see, youth services.

258
00:28:35,625 --> 00:28:38,753
I waited over a year to get that
transfer. I'm not gonna jeopardize--

259
00:28:38,828 --> 00:28:43,162
Jeopardize what? Cushy deskjob?

260
00:28:43,232 --> 00:28:45,826
- Forensics is not my area.
- I disagree with you.

261
00:28:46,569 --> 00:28:48,594
You can't force me
to take this assignment.

262
00:28:51,774 --> 00:28:52,934
I can.

263
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:57,411
- And if I refuse?
- You'd put your career at risk.

264
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,677
You think, because of your condition,
you can push people around?

265
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,843
I'm sorry.
That is truly pathetic.

266
00:29:04,253 --> 00:29:06,050
- Truly?
- Yeah, damn right.

267
00:29:07,523 --> 00:29:10,583
Well, forgive me, truly...

268
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:14,255
if I insist on having someone with
your brains and a fresh pair of eyes.

269
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:17,458
There's a life
at stake here, Officer.

270
00:29:18,367 --> 00:29:21,200
We're gonna need some key people
and tech support.

271
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:23,534
- I know the guy.
- Okay.

272
00:29:24,307 --> 00:29:26,798
What the hell are you smiling at?

273
00:29:36,452 --> 00:29:40,946
Pull up a chair. Tell me everything
you know about the crime scene.

274
00:29:42,091 --> 00:29:45,356
- You saw my report.
- I read your report.

275
00:29:45,428 --> 00:29:47,362
I wanna know what you felt.

276
00:29:48,097 --> 00:29:50,565
What you feel...

277
00:29:50,633 --> 00:29:52,897
in the deepest recesses
of your senses.

278
00:29:52,969 --> 00:29:56,700
You are in love with the sound
of your own voice, aren't you?

279
00:29:56,772 --> 00:30:00,037
It's your voice I yearn to hear.
Pull up a chair. I won't bite you.

280
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:31,797
The rifling on the.38 slug
they dug out of the victim...

281
00:30:31,874 --> 00:30:35,332
is consistent with a Webley, a very
old, turn-of-the-century handgun.

282
00:30:35,411 --> 00:30:37,879
Thank you, Kenny.
On the big board, please.

283
00:30:37,947 --> 00:30:41,940
- What do you got on that bolt?
- Three initials on the head: N.S.G.

284
00:30:42,018 --> 00:30:44,919
And the bolt's not steel,
it's iron.

285
00:30:44,987 --> 00:30:47,251
Iron? Iron.

286
00:30:47,323 --> 00:30:51,020
Making it old-- like the Webley.

287
00:30:51,093 --> 00:30:54,551
Officer Donaghy,
what do you know about asbestos?

288
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:57,793
- It kills hard-working Americans daily.
- Very good.

289
00:30:57,867 --> 00:31:00,028
- You computer literate?
- A little.

290
00:31:02,772 --> 00:31:05,070
- Where's my Thelma?
- Guess.

291
00:31:06,142 --> 00:31:08,269
Thelma, meet Amelia.
Amelia, Thelma.

292
00:31:08,344 --> 00:31:12,576
Amelia hates my books and computers, but
she's got an A-plus nose for evidence...

293
00:31:12,648 --> 00:31:17,142
so I want you to give her a crash course
in how to access D.E.P. files.

294
00:31:17,219 --> 00:31:21,451
Check if there's any large asbestos
cleanups going on in the city.

295
00:31:21,524 --> 00:31:22,718
A.S.A.P.

296
00:31:24,493 --> 00:31:27,519
- Where the hell is Eddie Ortiz?
- I'm right here!

297
00:31:30,166 --> 00:31:32,566
How's the world's
crankiest criminalist doing?

298
00:31:32,635 --> 00:31:34,227
Playing beat the clock.

299
00:31:34,303 --> 00:31:36,203
Everybody's worst nightmare.

300
00:31:36,272 --> 00:31:39,764
You get into a cab, and there's
a psycho from Jersey driving.

301
00:31:39,842 --> 00:31:41,776
We don't know he's from Jersey.

302
00:31:41,844 --> 00:31:45,007
Yeah, Bayonne. It's the toxins
in the water over there.

303
00:31:45,081 --> 00:31:48,448
- What'd you do, bring the whole lab?
- Mama always said be prepared.

304
00:31:48,517 --> 00:31:51,179
- Where do you want this?
-Just put it in the corner.

305
00:31:51,253 --> 00:31:53,221
How is your mother?

306
00:31:53,289 --> 00:31:57,123
She's 76, and she's schtupping some guy
named Morris. Can you believe it?

307
00:31:57,193 --> 00:32:00,685
- God bless her.
- It's Morris I'm worried about.

308
00:32:00,763 --> 00:32:04,221
He's 79, with a tricky ticker
and an active pecker.

309
00:32:12,274 --> 00:32:14,469
Afternoon.
Captain Cheney.

310
00:32:14,543 --> 00:32:16,602
What's your address?

311
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:19,147
There's about a dozen cleanups
scattered across the five boroughs.

312
00:32:19,215 --> 00:32:21,240
Put it up on the viewer for me,
will you, please?

313
00:32:21,317 --> 00:32:24,252
Narrow it down to the oldest location
as soon as you can.

314
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,379
- How you doing, Howard?
- Fine, thank you.

315
00:32:26,455 --> 00:32:29,549
- How's it going?
- Middle of the middle, as you can see.

316
00:32:29,625 --> 00:32:33,857
Hey, Linc, look what I found
on the threading of that iron bolt.

317
00:32:35,431 --> 00:32:37,899
Look, I was hoping
to grab a minute with you.

318
00:32:37,967 --> 00:32:40,060
- If you don't mind.
- Excuse me, Howard.

319
00:32:40,136 --> 00:32:41,797
Sorry.

320
00:32:41,871 --> 00:32:46,331
We got Officer Donaghy to thank here
for photographing the crucial evidence.

321
00:32:46,408 --> 00:32:49,639
Crucial evidence?
We don't know that.

322
00:32:49,712 --> 00:32:53,341
I just stopped by to make sure
you had all the support you need.

323
00:32:53,415 --> 00:32:57,977
I'm putting the full resources
of my department here at your disposal.

324
00:32:58,053 --> 00:33:00,419
And I appreciate it, Howie,
thank you.

325
00:33:00,489 --> 00:33:02,423
But the thing is, Linc...

326
00:33:02,491 --> 00:33:07,258
I've formalized department standard
procedure since you were in charge...

327
00:33:07,329 --> 00:33:09,854
Eddie, could you put whatyou got
up on my screen, please?

328
00:33:09,932 --> 00:33:13,493
so I'd appreciate it
if you kept me in the loop.

329
00:33:13,569 --> 00:33:14,661
Absolutely.

330
00:33:15,538 --> 00:33:17,267
At all times.

331
00:33:17,339 --> 00:33:21,070
At all-- Eddie, what the hell
is that we're looking at?

332
00:33:23,979 --> 00:33:25,537
Old paper.

333
00:33:25,614 --> 00:33:27,741
Coarse grade.

334
00:33:27,817 --> 00:33:31,446
I say, 80, 90 years old.

335
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,681
Turn of the century,
it looks like.

336
00:33:35,758 --> 00:33:37,851
This perp likes old.

337
00:33:39,929 --> 00:33:43,626
- I'll be in my office if you need me.
- Yeah, okay.

338
00:33:44,366 --> 00:33:45,697
Good.

339
00:33:49,071 --> 00:33:50,504
Old paper.

340
00:33:51,574 --> 00:33:53,041
Old gun.

341
00:33:55,778 --> 00:33:58,906
Buried his victim in a vintage
Civil War railroad bed.

342
00:34:00,249 --> 00:34:01,682
Sand.

343
00:34:03,953 --> 00:34:05,978
Eddie, what do you got
on the sand?

344
00:34:06,889 --> 00:34:10,586
Doesn't really look like sand.

345
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:13,753
- I'm not sure.
- Can you individuate it?

346
00:34:13,829 --> 00:34:18,391
- If I had E.D.X., I could do anything.
- We don't have that, Eddie.

347
00:34:18,467 --> 00:34:22,460
Look who forgot their chill pill
this morning. Excuse me.

348
00:34:22,538 --> 00:34:25,632
Come on, I'm all over
this thing now.

349
00:34:25,708 --> 00:34:29,667
We're talking pearly looking.

350
00:34:30,412 --> 00:34:35,247
Some kind of shellfish or something.

351
00:34:37,286 --> 00:34:38,844
Oysters shells, maybe?

352
00:34:40,623 --> 00:34:42,352
Could be.

353
00:34:43,692 --> 00:34:47,287
Definitely. If I had to bet on it,
I'd say it was. Sure.

354
00:34:50,332 --> 00:34:52,323
I got it. The oldest asbestos sites
are coming up now.

355
00:35:23,465 --> 00:35:28,129
In 1913, when the Woolworth Building
was being built...

356
00:35:28,203 --> 00:35:31,764
workmen found the body of this rich
industrialist, Talbot Soames.

357
00:35:32,942 --> 00:35:35,206
He'd been kidnapped the year before,
shot in the head and buried...

358
00:35:35,277 --> 00:35:39,145
in what they thought was white sand
but turned out to be oyster shells.

359
00:35:39,214 --> 00:35:43,810
Crushed oyster shells-- That's what they
used as landfill in lower Manhattan.

360
00:35:43,886 --> 00:35:46,855
That's how Pearl Street got its name.
That's where Ms. Rubin is gonna be--

361
00:35:46,922 --> 00:35:49,015
somewhere downtown.

362
00:35:49,091 --> 00:35:51,525
She's gonna be underground.

363
00:35:51,593 --> 00:35:54,061
She's gonna be in a basement...

364
00:35:54,129 --> 00:35:56,757
near or in the Woolworth Building.

365
00:35:56,832 --> 00:36:02,031
Paulie, call Emergency Services Unit
to meet us at the Woolworth Building.

366
00:36:02,104 --> 00:36:04,038
Tell them to start their search.
Maybe we'll get lucky.

367
00:36:04,106 --> 00:36:06,370
Okay? Eddie,
did you bring your van?

368
00:36:06,442 --> 00:36:08,410
- It's downstairs.
- We're gonna need it.

369
00:36:08,477 --> 00:36:11,605
Throw your keys to Amelia.
Paulie, you and Solomon go with her.

370
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:15,411
- Shouldn't I go too?
- You stay. We're gonna work that bolt.

371
00:36:15,484 --> 00:36:18,715
- That's the missing piece.
- Should we keep Cheney in the loop?

372
00:36:18,787 --> 00:36:20,049
Fuck him.

373
00:36:27,062 --> 00:36:28,893
Just trust me.

374
00:36:28,964 --> 00:36:33,663
Just follow those instincts
you were born with. I'll be with you...

375
00:36:33,736 --> 00:36:35,704
every step ofthe way.

376
00:36:46,281 --> 00:36:48,215
Jesus, 25 minutes left.

377
00:36:49,785 --> 00:36:54,313
- How did Rhyme get to be that way?
- He was born brilliant. It happens.

378
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:56,324
I mean the physical part.

379
00:36:57,659 --> 00:37:00,355
About four years ago, he was working
the body of a transit cop...

380
00:37:00,429 --> 00:37:02,693
found shot in a subway tunnel.

381
00:37:03,899 --> 00:37:06,333
Beam came down
and damn near cut him in half.

382
00:37:07,403 --> 00:37:08,836
Jesus.

383
00:37:10,506 --> 00:37:14,067
- Family?
- Married sister in Phoenix.

384
00:37:14,143 --> 00:37:17,442
He never sees her.
Cut himself off.

385
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:21,377
Technically, he's still active duty
collecting full pay.

386
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:24,476
P.B.A. insurance picks up
round-the-clock care and the gadgets.

387
00:37:24,553 --> 00:37:27,920
On weekends, always one or two cops
there, lending a hand.

388
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:31,221
- Tough deal winding up like that.
- You won't hear him complain about it.

389
00:37:31,293 --> 00:37:33,488
He gets too much pleasure
pushing other people's buttons.

390
00:37:33,562 --> 00:37:36,156
In your case,
I'd be complimented.

391
00:37:36,231 --> 00:37:38,529
You gotta learn to relax
around a compliment...

392
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,465
especially one from Rhyme.

393
00:37:40,536 --> 00:37:43,027
- You can be a little grating.
- Me?

394
00:37:43,105 --> 00:37:46,541
Kiddo, if you were any more wound up,
you'd be a Timex.

395
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:55,841
He was a human dynamo. Writing books,
lecturing all over the world...

396
00:37:55,918 --> 00:37:58,113
giving expert opinion in trials...

397
00:37:58,187 --> 00:38:00,246
working half the crimes scenes
in the city.

398
00:38:00,322 --> 00:38:03,723
- You know what he did on his downtime?
- I can't imagine.

399
00:38:03,792 --> 00:38:06,886
He'd collect things--
dirt, metals, plastics...

400
00:38:06,962 --> 00:38:10,227
hubcaps, plants, musical strings...

401
00:38:10,299 --> 00:38:12,460
medical tools--
anything you could think of.

402
00:38:12,534 --> 00:38:13,796
Obsessive.

403
00:38:13,869 --> 00:38:17,965
He'd have it all analyzed
and catalogued for his database.

404
00:38:19,875 --> 00:38:23,504
Jesus Christ! I'd like to get there
in one piece, if possible.

405
00:38:50,439 --> 00:38:52,373
Yeah, find out about that.
That might be good. What else?

406
00:38:52,441 --> 00:38:54,739
Nicholas Steven Gerard,
elevator construction.

407
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:57,506
- Gotta be underground.
- I got a subway builder here.

408
00:38:57,579 --> 00:39:02,016
- Subway builder's out.
- N.S.G.-- Niagara Steam Generation.

409
00:39:02,084 --> 00:39:05,212
Bought by Eastern Gas and Electric
in 1928.

410
00:39:05,287 --> 00:39:09,485
The six-inch iron bolt was used
mainly for steam pipe assemblies.

411
00:39:56,038 --> 00:39:58,302
Forty-five, you got 11 minutes left.
Where the hell are you?

412
00:39:58,373 --> 00:40:01,171
We just hit the financial district.

413
00:40:01,243 --> 00:40:05,907
There's a steam junction
with big asbestos-coated pipes.

414
00:40:05,981 --> 00:40:10,850
That's where our victim's gonna be.
I bet my legs on it-- Wall and Nassau.

415
00:40:13,088 --> 00:40:15,022
Has E.S.U. been notified?

416
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:16,885
Yeah, they're on their way.

417
00:40:16,959 --> 00:40:21,225
E.S.U. says that steam is released
through that junction every day at 4:00.

418
00:40:21,296 --> 00:40:24,094
Shit, what's this asshole up to?

419
00:40:24,166 --> 00:40:27,260
I don'tknow, but it's gonna happen
in about ten minutes and 30 seconds.

420
00:40:28,704 --> 00:40:30,729
All right, Linc, we're here.
We're going down there.

421
00:40:37,446 --> 00:40:38,640
Yeah, I'm here.

422
00:40:38,714 --> 00:40:41,239
It's their job to try
and save Mrs. Rubin's life.

423
00:40:41,316 --> 00:40:45,719
It's your job to get ready
and work the crime scene if necessary.

424
00:40:47,189 --> 00:40:50,420
There's some things you're gonna need,
so lookin the back of the truck.

425
00:40:50,492 --> 00:40:56,055
You'll see an aluminum suitcase
and a radio headset.

426
00:40:57,032 --> 00:40:59,933
- See it?
- Yeah, I see them.

427
00:41:21,523 --> 00:41:23,457
There must be a way in.

428
00:41:25,193 --> 00:41:28,685
- What's the problem here?
- Fucking valves freeze up easy.

429
00:41:29,431 --> 00:41:30,955
Come on, guys, shut it off.

430
00:41:31,033 --> 00:41:33,661
- You there?
- I'm here.

431
00:41:34,736 --> 00:41:37,170
- I'm inside the pipe.
- One, two, three.

432
00:41:42,444 --> 00:41:43,877
Go!

433
00:41:46,048 --> 00:41:49,779
I think I hear something.
I hear something.

434
00:41:49,851 --> 00:41:53,014
What is it? Someone's in there!
I can hear her crying.

435
00:41:53,855 --> 00:41:55,789
Everyone, quiet now.

436
00:42:06,201 --> 00:42:07,725
Mrs. Rubin?

437
00:42:16,511 --> 00:42:19,207
She's in there.
Mrs. Rubin!

438
00:42:19,281 --> 00:42:23,047
We're on our way in now.
Come on, guys.

439
00:42:23,118 --> 00:42:26,383
Let's go.
Let's hurry the fuck up!

440
00:42:26,455 --> 00:42:29,424
-Jesus Christ.
- Get a drill and a tap.

441
00:42:29,491 --> 00:42:31,550
Somebody cut this thing
halfway through.

442
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:36,590
Let's dig!

443
00:42:57,252 --> 00:42:58,776
Move back!

444
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:44,422
Linc, she's gone.

445
00:43:44,499 --> 00:43:47,297
The whole place is scalded in steam.

446
00:43:47,369 --> 00:43:49,200
Let's go. Move away.

447
00:43:49,304 --> 00:43:50,737
Nothing to see here.

448
00:43:50,806 --> 00:43:54,503
E.S.U. are gonna blow a hole in the
subbasement wall. No otherway in.

449
00:43:54,576 --> 00:43:58,672
I am working with Chief Murphy's
authorization on this, right?

450
00:43:58,747 --> 00:44:02,444
- Yeah, that's right.
- I don't want E.S.U. guys...

451
00:44:02,517 --> 00:44:06,317
rushing in there, trampling the evidence
before we get a chance to run the scene.

452
00:44:06,388 --> 00:44:10,449
- What do you want?
- I want Donaghy to go in first.

453
00:44:10,525 --> 00:44:13,255
Come on, Linc,
she's not trained for this.

454
00:44:13,328 --> 00:44:15,262
We can get our asses in a sling.

455
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:17,992
My ass has been in a sling
for four years.

456
00:44:18,066 --> 00:44:21,297
Tell Hanson and his beasts
that's what I want. Period.

457
00:44:21,369 --> 00:44:23,303
All right, you got it.

458
00:44:31,413 --> 00:44:33,540
Okay, let's move!

459
00:44:43,158 --> 00:44:45,490
I'm doing this under protest.

460
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:47,528
The perp could still be in there.

461
00:44:47,596 --> 00:44:50,429
Rhyme's in charge,
and they're his orders.

462
00:44:50,499 --> 00:44:53,957
You can't handle it in there,
I want you to get your ass out.

463
00:44:54,035 --> 00:44:56,503
- Amelia, you ready?
- Yeah.

464
00:44:56,571 --> 00:44:58,505
You listen to me.

465
00:44:59,574 --> 00:45:02,042
I'm with you every step of the way.

466
00:45:03,278 --> 00:45:04,540
Go on.

467
00:45:04,613 --> 00:45:06,547
Good luck.

468
00:45:17,659 --> 00:45:20,560
- I'm in.
- Tell me what you see.

469
00:45:27,002 --> 00:45:30,995
Everything's been boiled to hell.

470
00:45:35,477 --> 00:45:36,910
Oh, God.

471
00:45:36,978 --> 00:45:39,071
What is it?

472
00:45:39,147 --> 00:45:42,014
It's an awful smell.

473
00:45:42,083 --> 00:45:43,880
That means you're close.

474
00:46:07,676 --> 00:46:11,077
- I can't believe I'm doing this.
- You're fine.

475
00:46:11,146 --> 00:46:15,947
Just fine. You're doing great.
Just remember the academy.

476
00:46:16,017 --> 00:46:19,418
When you walk,
move in a straight line.

477
00:46:19,487 --> 00:46:22,285
We don't want to disturb
any footprints he might've left.

478
00:46:22,357 --> 00:46:24,291
Yes, assuming he's gone.

479
00:46:32,334 --> 00:46:36,464
There's no footprints.
There's nothing yet.

480
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:53,745
Oh, God.

481
00:46:53,822 --> 00:46:55,289
What?

482
00:46:55,357 --> 00:46:57,291
Talk tome.

483
00:47:01,096 --> 00:47:03,530
I can see her.

484
00:47:08,603 --> 00:47:13,631
The steam pipe was opened, and she's
tied down right in front of it.

485
00:47:13,708 --> 00:47:16,802
Okay. There's nothing
you can do about that now.

486
00:47:16,878 --> 00:47:21,110
Can't do anything but help her
by working the crime scene.

487
00:47:21,182 --> 00:47:22,444
That's your job.

488
00:47:22,517 --> 00:47:25,452
Open your suitcase,
get your camera.

489
00:48:09,064 --> 00:48:10,326
I can't do this.

490
00:48:10,398 --> 00:48:14,027
You can do it. Yes, you can.
Yesterday you stopped a train.

491
00:48:14,102 --> 00:48:16,730
You can do anything you want
when you put your mind to it.

492
00:48:16,805 --> 00:48:19,239
Don't work me, Rhyme.

493
00:48:25,246 --> 00:48:30,445
- Just tell me what to do next.
- Very slowly, walk the grid...

494
00:48:30,518 --> 00:48:32,952
one foot in front of the other.

495
00:48:38,059 --> 00:48:41,460
I want you to look around you now.
Remember...

496
00:48:41,529 --> 00:48:45,522
crime scenes are three-dimensional--
floors, walls and ceilings.

497
00:48:54,175 --> 00:48:56,109
Yeah, I'm here.

498
00:48:57,512 --> 00:48:59,446
There's something strange.

499
00:49:00,281 --> 00:49:02,215
Things he left for us?

500
00:49:07,388 --> 00:49:08,719
Yes.

501
00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:12,658
- In a cluster again?
- There's a small piece of wood...

502
00:49:12,727 --> 00:49:15,252
and it looks like some hair.

503
00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:17,662
I'm gonna walk you through
collecting the evidence.

504
00:49:17,732 --> 00:49:19,962
You do everything
exactly as I say.

505
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:33,645
- Oh,Jesus.
- Talk tome.

506
00:49:34,716 --> 00:49:37,241
- It's a bloody bone.
- Where is it?

507
00:49:39,254 --> 00:49:41,950
It's in my fucking hand.

508
00:49:42,023 --> 00:49:43,513
Human?

509
00:49:46,661 --> 00:49:48,458
I think so, yeah.

510
00:49:48,530 --> 00:49:50,430
Photograph it...

511
00:49:50,498 --> 00:49:52,989
bag it.

512
00:50:09,851 --> 00:50:13,287
Okay, that's it.
I'm outta here.

513
00:50:14,389 --> 00:50:16,687
One more thing.

514
00:50:16,758 --> 00:50:19,158
We gotta process the body.

515
00:50:21,229 --> 00:50:23,254
What? I'm no medical examiner.
I can't do that.

516
00:50:23,331 --> 00:50:24,889
I'm not asking you to do an autopsy.

517
00:50:24,966 --> 00:50:29,630
I just want you to--
Just describe the restraints.

518
00:50:43,484 --> 00:50:45,577
They're strange-looking handcuffs.

519
00:50:45,653 --> 00:50:48,087
They look more like
old shackles or something.

520
00:50:52,594 --> 00:50:55,392
And there's a chain
across her waist.

521
00:50:55,463 --> 00:50:57,522
And her feet are...

522
00:50:57,599 --> 00:50:59,533
bound with a rope.

523
00:51:02,170 --> 00:51:04,104
Hands above her head?

524
00:51:05,039 --> 00:51:06,472
Yeah.

525
00:51:10,478 --> 00:51:14,915
There's also a large piece of flesh
missing from her right forearm.

526
00:51:16,618 --> 00:51:20,179
It's right down to the bone,
like it was surgically removed.

527
00:51:21,689 --> 00:51:23,213
This is what I want you to do.

528
00:51:23,291 --> 00:51:26,124
We're gonna need those handcuffs.

529
00:51:26,194 --> 00:51:29,721
It's probably our best chance
for good prints.

530
00:51:29,797 --> 00:51:31,856
The M.E. can remove them
when they get here.

531
00:51:31,933 --> 00:51:35,960
The M.E. is all thumbs.
They'll mess up the prints.

532
00:51:36,037 --> 00:51:39,632
Look in the suitcase.
There's a small saw.

533
00:51:48,283 --> 00:51:49,716
Okay.

534
00:51:49,784 --> 00:51:53,117
I wantyou to saw her hands off
at the wrist line.

535
00:51:53,187 --> 00:51:56,714
We gotta have those cuffs
for prints.

536
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:20,640
I can't.

537
00:52:20,715 --> 00:52:23,650
Cut her hands off.
We need the handcuffs.

538
00:52:23,718 --> 00:52:25,413
I can't. No.

539
00:52:25,486 --> 00:52:28,512
Saw off her hands,
take off the cuffs.

540
00:52:31,192 --> 00:52:33,660
Listen to me. Saw off her h--
We need those cuffs.

541
00:52:33,728 --> 00:52:34,922
I can't!

542
00:52:34,996 --> 00:52:37,521
- Amelia, we need--
- No, fuck you!

543
00:52:47,842 --> 00:52:51,972
If he wants that woman's hands cut off,
he can come down and do it himself.

544
00:55:49,323 --> 00:55:50,756
Hello?

545
00:55:51,893 --> 00:55:53,827
Who is it?

546
00:56:26,427 --> 00:56:27,860
Jesus.

547
00:56:49,951 --> 00:56:52,579
- Take it easy.
- Shit, what are you doing?

548
00:56:53,821 --> 00:56:56,654
- You okay?
- Am I okay? What are you doing?

549
00:56:56,724 --> 00:56:59,625
Rhyme has been trying
to call you for hours.

550
00:56:59,694 --> 00:57:02,424
Your phone's down.
He was concerned.

551
00:57:02,496 --> 00:57:06,899
My phone's fine.
I don't need his concern.

552
00:57:06,968 --> 00:57:09,402
He needs you over
at his place right away.

553
00:57:11,472 --> 00:57:15,101
I don't work for Lincoln Rhyme.

554
00:57:15,176 --> 00:57:18,304
Rhyme thinks the evidence you collected
indicates there's another vic in play.

555
00:57:18,379 --> 00:57:21,405
And he's laying that at my feet?

556
00:57:21,482 --> 00:57:23,609
Don't shoot the messenger.

557
00:57:45,573 --> 00:57:49,441
- You just move in?
- Yeah, about a year ago.

558
00:57:54,081 --> 00:57:55,514
Really?

559
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:16,797
- You were a model.
- Yeah, when I was a kid.

560
00:58:16,871 --> 00:58:20,671
Kid model to street cop--
there's a leap.

561
00:58:23,911 --> 00:58:25,845
For whatever it's worth...

562
00:58:27,748 --> 00:58:29,978
I thought what you did today
was pretty damn terrific.

563
00:59:12,993 --> 00:59:14,551
Hey, you guys. I'm outta here.

564
00:59:15,796 --> 00:59:18,356
I'm gonna grab a cab.
I got a paper to finish.

565
00:59:18,432 --> 00:59:21,299
- I'm just gonna hang.
- I'll be there in a minute.

566
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:40,982
Taxi!

567
00:59:50,631 --> 00:59:53,498
That bone's definitely not human.

568
00:59:53,567 --> 00:59:56,695
- And the hair?
- Not human either.

569
00:59:56,771 --> 01:00:00,207
- Well, what is it?
- Working fast as I can.

570
01:00:02,777 --> 01:00:05,245
Glad to see you could join us.

571
01:00:05,312 --> 01:00:08,941
I got Cheney on the line.
He wants you to brief him.

572
01:00:09,016 --> 01:00:10,950
Tell him I'll call him back.

573
01:00:12,653 --> 01:00:14,086
Two things:

574
01:00:15,656 --> 01:00:17,988
First, you did a hell of a job
locating the evidence.

575
01:00:18,058 --> 01:00:20,583
There's no question
the perp knows forensics.

576
01:00:21,662 --> 01:00:23,220
Now, as for the other thing...

577
01:00:23,297 --> 01:00:24,559
the--

578
01:00:28,035 --> 01:00:31,937
you know, the victim's hands--
well, maybe--

579
01:00:34,008 --> 01:00:36,306
maybe it was too much to handle,
so we'll just forget it.

580
01:00:37,378 --> 01:00:39,312
Is that your version
of an apology?

581
01:00:39,380 --> 01:00:43,646
An apology?
Is that why you came over here?

582
01:00:45,386 --> 01:00:48,844
- You really are a piece of work.
- Well, aren't we a pair?

583
01:00:51,158 --> 01:00:53,319
I think you're terrific.

584
01:00:56,997 --> 01:00:59,261
You got a hell of an arrest record too.

585
01:01:00,334 --> 01:01:04,361
High marks from all your bosses,
definite gold shield potential.

586
01:01:05,105 --> 01:01:08,472
Why you want to throw it all away
to chase youth offenders?

587
01:01:09,777 --> 01:01:11,768
Oh, I don't feel I have any need
to explain that to you.

588
01:01:11,846 --> 01:01:13,780
Come on, Amelia. Cop to cop.

589
01:01:13,848 --> 01:01:17,648
Cop to cop, let's just
leave it at ''personal reasons.''

590
01:01:17,718 --> 01:01:20,084
Okay.

591
01:01:20,154 --> 01:01:22,486
Doesn't have anything to do
with your father, does it?

592
01:01:30,064 --> 01:01:32,157
Man, you just keep
charging at walls, don't you?

593
01:01:32,233 --> 01:01:34,292
Stubbornness is something
we both share.

594
01:01:35,870 --> 01:01:40,204
They say we come into this world
with a genetically preordained destiny.

595
01:01:40,274 --> 01:01:41,673
I don't believe it.

596
01:01:41,742 --> 01:01:45,872
For example, neither of my parents had
more than an eighth grade education.

597
01:01:45,946 --> 01:01:49,109
Never read more
than one book between them-- not one.

598
01:01:49,850 --> 01:01:51,374
I've read thousands.

599
01:01:51,452 --> 01:01:54,421
- I've written a dozen.
- What's your point?

600
01:01:54,488 --> 01:01:58,822
My point is that destiny is
what you make it.

601
01:02:01,495 --> 01:02:04,589
Whatever happened to your father
doesn't mean it's gonna happen to you.

602
01:02:04,665 --> 01:02:08,362
You're a great cop.
You'd make a terrific detective.

603
01:02:09,603 --> 01:02:12,094
It's a gift.

604
01:02:13,173 --> 01:02:15,107
Don't throw it away.

605
01:02:22,016 --> 01:02:24,075
Report from the taxi commission.

606
01:02:24,151 --> 01:02:26,585
An NYU student was abducted
late last night.

607
01:02:26,654 --> 01:02:28,588
His girlfriend saw him
struggling to get out...

608
01:02:28,656 --> 01:02:32,251
as the taxi driver was
bludgeoning him with a flashlight.

609
01:02:32,326 --> 01:02:34,260
No description of the driver.

610
01:02:34,328 --> 01:02:37,024
Okay, everybody.
This could be our next victim.

611
01:02:37,097 --> 01:02:40,032
Yeah, Tony. Paulie here.
It looks like we got another victim.

612
01:02:42,503 --> 01:02:44,494
Did you get a deadline
off that evidence yet?

613
01:02:46,607 --> 01:02:49,599
Not yet. Something I was hoping
you'd help me with.

614
01:04:18,298 --> 01:04:20,789
Anyone for some osso buco?

615
01:04:20,868 --> 01:04:22,893
What?

616
01:04:22,970 --> 01:04:26,167
The bone we found
at the Wall Street scene--

617
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:27,673
veal shank...

618
01:04:27,741 --> 01:04:29,675
braised and overly salted to boot.

619
01:04:29,743 --> 01:04:31,836
- Cow bone?
- Uh-huh.

620
01:04:31,912 --> 01:04:35,871
And I also found
a piece of that old paper...

621
01:04:35,949 --> 01:04:37,849
imbedded in the bone.

622
01:04:37,918 --> 01:04:39,510
Take a look.

623
01:04:43,457 --> 01:04:45,084
What's going on here?

624
01:04:45,159 --> 01:04:47,354
Just do what you need to do
as quickly as possible, okay, Richard?

625
01:04:47,428 --> 01:04:49,419
It's about the hair follicles.
He says they're not human.

626
01:04:49,496 --> 01:04:51,396
A rodent, probably a rat.

627
01:04:51,465 --> 01:04:53,194
And get this:
They were shaved off.

628
01:04:53,267 --> 01:04:55,531
Oh, now we're looking for
a rat that shaves.

629
01:04:55,602 --> 01:04:58,662
- I really like that.
- I've known a few in my time.

630
01:04:58,739 --> 01:05:01,936
- How 'bout you, Amelia?
- More than a few.

631
01:05:02,676 --> 01:05:05,543
It's consistent with underground,
that's for sure.

632
01:05:05,612 --> 01:05:07,876
What's he trying to say to us?

633
01:05:07,948 --> 01:05:09,677
Definitely communicating
in our language...

634
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:12,014
leaving clues--
forensic clues at that.

635
01:05:12,086 --> 01:05:13,678
Maybe it's a cop.

636
01:05:14,688 --> 01:05:15,950
Maybe.

637
01:05:16,790 --> 01:05:19,691
Maybe he's trying to share the
responsibility of these murders with us.

638
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:22,888
If we don't figure out the clues
in time, the blood's on our hands.

639
01:05:22,963 --> 01:05:27,059
We don't find the victim in time, we're
as responsible for the murders as he is.

640
01:05:27,801 --> 01:05:29,632
What you got on the dirt
you scraped from the wood, Eddie?

641
01:05:30,404 --> 01:05:34,465
I don't have it 100% individuated,
but it does appear nitrogen-rich.

642
01:05:34,541 --> 01:05:36,600
- All set, ready to rock and roll.
- All right.

643
01:05:36,677 --> 01:05:38,611
- Thanks for rushing. I appreciate it.
- All right, Thelma.
