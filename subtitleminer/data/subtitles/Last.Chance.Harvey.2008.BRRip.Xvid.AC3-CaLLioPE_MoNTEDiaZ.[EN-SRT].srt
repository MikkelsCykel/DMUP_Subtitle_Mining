00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,080
- Morning, Paddy.
- Morning, Kate.

2
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,960
Looking lovelier than ever.
If I was only a younger man-

3
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,680
Oh, shut up!

4
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:24,440
Mum, it's me,
your daughter.

5
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,920
- Post.
- Have a cup of tea with me.

6
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,000
Can't. I'm running late.
Sorry.

7
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:49,000
- He's at it again.
- Who? At what?

8
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,160
The new neighbor,
barbecuing or something.

9
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,160
I've heard he's from Poland.

10
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,880
Oh, well, you know, maybe Polish people
like to barbecue a lot.

11
00:02:00,881 --> 00:02:02,520
I can't find your-

12
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,920
- Oh, here it is.
- Where do you put this?

13
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,880
It's my toothbrush thingy.
Just stop fiddling.

14
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,560
Prescription.

15
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,720
Now listen, you do not
have to keep taking these.

16
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,640
- The doctor said.
- I like to.

17
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,920
Makes me feel better.

18
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,560
All right, well, listen. I'm off.
I'll, um-

19
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,520
See you later, or call you later.

20
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,200
You got that date thing tonight?

21
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,680
I don't know.
Maybe.

22
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,120
Time and tide, Kate,
as your father liked to say.

23
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,800
Was that from his terrace
in the south of France?

24
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,600
Sorry. That was mean.

25
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,040
Hug me.

26
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,200
Hug me!

27
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,800
Bye, Mum.

28
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,960
I am a cow.

29
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,080
Put my score up first.

30
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,960
- They don't want to hear it, Harvey.
- But I want to see it.

31
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,480
- Put it up.
- I'm backed up already.

32
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:00,040
Johnnie, you were the one that was late.
Just put it up.

33
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,760
Okay.

34
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,960
Listen, Harvey, Marvin wants me
to present my ideas while you're away.

35
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,320
Huh?

36
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,720
Look, I'm not doing myself any favors here,
Harvey, but I'd watch your back.

37
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,040
Harvey:.
Marvin. Hey, Marvin.

38
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,600
Hey, Harvey.
Shouldn't you be in London?

39
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,400
Yeah. I'm heading there now.
What's going on?

40
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,280
Johnnie said something about
you wanting him to present on Monday?

41
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,320
Oh, yeah. No, no.

42
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,480
I was just thinking that, with you being in
London, you should stay a while.

43
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,560
- What?
- There's no need to rush back.

44
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,560
- Enjoy your daughter's wedding.
- What?

45
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,880
Well, Johnnie can do it.

46
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,520
I mean, he can pitch
the Samuelson account.

47
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,160
No. I'm coming back.
Those are my connections.

48
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,480
- They have been for years.
- I know. I'm just-

49
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,240
They've got new people there,
you know?

50
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,960
I think they might want
something different.

51
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,120
I really want to come back.
I should be there in person.

52
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,560
In person?

53
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,240
Yeah. I want to
stand behind my music.

54
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,440
But nobody cares, Harvey.

55
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,160
They're demos.
They're already pressed.

56
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,040
Nobody gives a shit.
They don't need to see you.

57
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,000
They don't need to see me.

58
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,560
I'm back Monday, Marvin.
I'm coming back.

59
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,400
Well, you better land this one,
Harvey.

60
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,920
- What does that mean?
- It means what it means.

61
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,240
Say it.

62
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,400
There are no more chances,
Harvey.

63
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,800
Enjoy London.

64
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,320
- Are you on a holiday?
- No. Business.

65
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,040
You?

66
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,440
Oh, my daughter's
getting married.

67
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,680
Congratulations.

68
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,480
Yeah, thanks.
Well, kind of.

69
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:34,480
She's American, he's American, and they're
still getting married in London.

70
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:38,360
I told her we have a perfectly good
wedding system here.

71
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,160
I mean, they both work in London.
That's why they're-

72
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,120
- There you are, Sir.
- Oh, thanks. Thanks very much.

73
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,760
- Can I just give you this?
- Yes.

74
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,280
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

75
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,080
Does flying make you nervous?

76
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,440
No.
I do it all the time.

77
00:05:59,441 --> 00:06:04,400
Oh. I don't like it.
I have to fortify myself.

78
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,480
You know that old joke,
one guy says to the other-

79
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,560
Tell you what, I have got meetings
in the morning, when we land...

80
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,200
...so I think I'm gonna try
and get some sleep.

81
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,560
- Sure.
- Sorry, I just-

82
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,280
I'll be useless
if I don't get some sleep.

83
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,720
No, no.
Go ahead. Go ahead.

84
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,240
- Morning, Aggie.
- Morning, darling.

85
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,960
- All right?
- Mm-hmm.

86
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,120
"A filmy layer
on the surface of a liquid. "

87
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,680
Scum.

88
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,960
Scum!

89
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,240
"Manicure tool,"
four and four.

90
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,560
Oh, come on, Aggie.

91
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,400
- What? I'm just testing you.
- Nail file!

92
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,760
Sorry, sorry.

93
00:06:51,761 --> 00:06:54,280
Morning. Morning.

94
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,200
Oh, thank God
you're my boss, Kate.

95
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,680
- Morning, Aggie.
- Morning, darling.

96
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,880
So, we still on for tonight?

97
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:06,800
- Matt's definitely bringing Simon.
- No, no, no. I'm scared.

98
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,840
Oh, now, don't be scared!
He's gorgeous!

99
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,960
He's a big, strong, confident,
gorgeous fella.

100
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,440
You'll love him.
He's beautiful.

101
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,960
Right. Look, I'll come, but only
if you two swear blind.

102
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,760
...you will not leave me
on my own with him.

103
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,560
Oh, no, no.
Promise. Absolutely.

104
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,200
- Kate:. Can I trust her?
- No.

105
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,160
Of course you can trust me.
We'll drive you home.

106
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,640
We'll drive both of you home,
depending on what home you're going to!

107
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,960
- Oh, shut up.
- Yeah. He's got his own business.

108
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,520
- Really?
- Yeah.

109
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,000
What kind of business?

110
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,640
I don't know exactly.
I think it's stationery.

111
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,400
Oh. I've always loved stationery.

112
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,240
So not a business trip, then.

113
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,920
Man: No. Unless you count
three grandchildren as work.

114
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,720
- Some might.
- That's true.

115
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,920
Thank you very much for your time.
You're all done.

116
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,160
- Thank you.
- Safe trip home.

117
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,960
Thank you.
Bye-bye.

118
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,840
Excuse me. I wonder if I could trouble you
for two minutes of your time.

119
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,760
- Won't take a second.
- No.

120
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,920
I'm tired, you know?

121
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,840
Yes, I do.

122
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,360
Where to, Sir?

123
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,520
Hi, Susie.
It's your dad.

124
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,760
Uh, I made it, uh, and I'm in a taxi
on the way to the hotel.

125
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,880
Uh, I guess all you guys
are already there.

126
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,200
Anyways, I really look forward
to seeing you and everybody else.

127
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,280
I can't wait. Love you.
Bye-bye.

128
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,680
Hi, it's Harvey Shine here.

129
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:48,000
Just want to confirm that Mike
is going to be in the mix Monday.

130
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,360
And I'm reachable by my cellphone.

131
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,200
You probably have the number on file, but
just in case...

132
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,960
...it's 917-384-5368.

133
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,280
You may need an international code, so,
you know, I think you have to dial 044...

134
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,880
...or maybe, uh, not sure.

135
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:09,760
It could be 011.
You can try 44 then 1 and then 917.

136
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,480
Whatever it is, whether it's 044
or 44 or 011...

137
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,560
...after that, you may have to
put a 1 be-

138
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,360
Hello?

139
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,160
Hi.

140
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,520
I'm with the wedding party.
There should be a room for me.

141
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,840
Harvey Shine.

142
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,840
Yes. We have
a double room for you.

143
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,200
Good.
Is everyone else checked in?

144
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,280
I'm not sure, Sir.

145
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,320
My daughter - Susan Shine?

146
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,240
She may already be going by
the name Wright - Susan Wright.

147
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,600
W- R-I-G-H-T.

148
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,240
No, sir.
No one of that name.

149
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,000
Sir, Room 522.

150
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,320
Oh, boy.

151
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,640
Hello?

152
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,840
Hi, Susie.

153
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,560
I'm here. Where are you?
Where is everybody?

154
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,560
Oh. I didn't realize.

155
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,480
I thought the plan was
for everybody to stay together.

156
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,640
No. I just wasn't sure.
I-

157
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,160
No. I just- I didn't know
I was gonna be here by myself.

158
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,760
I thought that-

159
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,920
Anyway, so, your mom,
she rented a house for all of you, huh?

160
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,680
Oh, come on.
I'm a big boy.

161
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,080
I'm happy here.
It's very cozy.

162
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,480
Yes, I have the address.

163
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,800
Yeah. I love you, too.
I'll see you there.

164
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,320
Hello, Mum.

165
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,640
What are you wearing?

166
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,600
- Purple dungarees.
- Oh, you're not.

167
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:27,200
No, not really. I'm wearing a miniskirt
and a boob tube.

168
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,920
- They're totally back in.
- Oh, you're just being silly.

169
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,080
Now, don't be nervous.
Just be yourself.

170
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,040
Yes, thanks for the advice.

171
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,800
Oh, listen.
I've been thinking about Greece.

172
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,800
Yeah. Okay.
Well, can we talk about that later?

173
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,240
All right. Bye!

174
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,160
Bye.

175
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,800
- Kate.
- Ah.

176
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,120
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
I'm so sorry.

177
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,600
- Don't tell me your mother-
- Yeah.

178
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,080
Is that mine?

179
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,480
Cheers.
Thank God. Oh.

180
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,280
She's, um-

181
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,880
She's just on about some Pole living
next to her who's barbecuing a lot.

182
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,560
- Oh, very suspicious.
- Well, that's what she thinks.

183
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,840
Well, they're here.

184
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,320
- Okay.
- He's at the bar.

185
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,600
Very nice fella.
Very chatty.

186
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,120
- Okay.
- I like him. I like him.

187
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,440
- There's Matt.
- Hey.

188
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,000
Hi, Matt.

189
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,600
- How are you?
- I'm well. How are you?

190
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,360
- I'm good, too.
- Kate, this is Simon.

191
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,760
- How do you do?
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

192
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,080
So you're in stationery?

193
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,880
Um, I'm I.T. - Computing.

194
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,000
- You told me it was stationery.
- Oh!

195
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,480
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did, love.

196
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,360
Well, there's a bit of stationery involved.

197
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,800
Mainly computing, though.

198
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,240
- So not stationery.
- Let's sit down.

199
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,560
It doesn't matter.

200
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,880
Sorry, Matt.
It's just that I-

201
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,440
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

202
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,720
Cheers, lads.

203
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,040
Hmm.

204
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,040
Shit.

205
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,320
Yeah, I just-
I just got off the plane last night.

206
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,240
- Hey, Harvey!
- Hey. Scott.

207
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,160
- Harvey, you made it.
- Scott, how are you, man?

208
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,080
Hey, whoa.
What's up?

209
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,240
This is Susan's father- Harvey -
Harvey Shine.

210
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,840
This is Josh Hillman
and my best man- Pete Turner.

211
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,800
- How you guys doing?
- Good. How you doing, Harvey?

212
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,440
- Great.
- Yeah, it's great to see you.

213
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,160
Yeah, you too.
How you holding up?

214
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,600
Great, great.
Can't wait to marry Susie, really.

215
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,560
- Is she here?
- Oh, she's in there.

216
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,120
She'll be thrilled you're here.

217
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,400
- I'll just go and find her.
- Yeah.

218
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,840
Ooh. I got to take this.

219
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,440
Grab that phone.

220
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,640
Hello?

221
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,760
Yeah, it's Harvey.

222
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,320
No no no no,
that's not right.

223
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,320
I need this.
I need Mike.

224
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,000
No. I told him two weeks ago.
I booked him.

225
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,040
What?

226
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,640
No, but I-

227
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,040
Look, just tell him
to call me, okay? It's-

228
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,040
I booked him!

229
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,760
Uh, I'll talk to you later.

230
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,240
I'm sorry.
It's always something.

231
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,520
Sure. Yeah.

232
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,160
So, what's your field, Harvey?

233
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,160
Well, I'm in the music business.

234
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,000
Oh, wow.
Doing what?

235
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,200
You know, TV,
background, commercials.

236
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,560
- Cool. What kind of stuff?
- Commercials.

237
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,960
- Sounds profitable.
- Yeah, it can be.

238
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,240
So, you guys-
you work for Scott?

239
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,440
We work with Scott.

240
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,400
- And what is that, oil?
- Yeah, it's-

241
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,960
Well, that can be profitable.

242
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,960
Has its moments.

243
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,640
Yeah, okay. I think I should
just look for my daughter.

244
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,200
Absolutely. Hey, nice to meet you.
We'll see you in there.

245
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,560
- Talk to you later.
- Yeah, sure.

246
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,920
He's got to be younger than me.

247
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,040
Well, look, he's young.
He'll have plenty of energy.

248
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,960
- He's lovely. Big hands on him.
- You'll just say anything.

249
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,600
No, it's not-
don't answer that phone call.

250
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,800
I've got to answer it.

251
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,760
Kate, it's your mom.
You know it's your mom.

252
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,080
I know.
She's on her own. Come on.

253
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,560
Yeah, and so are you.

254
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,000
She is, like, human contraception, honest
to God.

255
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,520
- She's ruining your sex life.
- Shut up.

256
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,120
You go. You go.

257
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,480
Hello, Mum?

258
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,200
Yeah.
Can I ring you back?

259
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,920
Yeah, 'cause I'm out.
Okay, bye.

260
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,280
Hi.

261
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,760
I'll see you guys.

262
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,800
Hi!

263
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,280
Wow. Let me look.
Let me look.

264
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,760
Whoa.

265
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,200
You look beautiful.

266
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,400
Thank you.

267
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,960
- You look-
- Like a bad lounge act.

268
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,080
No, you don't.
You look very, very nice.

269
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,000
No. They told me that everyone
was going to wear white here.

270
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,720
But I was misinformed.

271
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,520
It looks good.
I like it.

272
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,600
Thank you.

273
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,720
- How was your flight?
- Fine.

274
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,640
So, uh, that's your guy?

275
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,280
Yeah.

276
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,600
It's a long way to come to see two
American kids get married.

277
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,600
Sorry for the inconvenience.

278
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:59,240
No. That's just a bad joke
'cause I'm jet-lagged. I'm sorry.

279
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,840
Have you seen Mom?

280
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:05,400
- No. Is she here with Brian?
- Yep. They're over by our table.

281
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,960
Oh.

282
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,400
So, is the house your mother rented
for almost everyone nice?

283
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,960
- Dad.
- What?

284
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,040
No. I just got to
get it out of my system.

285
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,720
I'm sorry.
It really is good to see you.

286
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,360
Give me a hug.

287
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,120
- Hey, look who I've got.
- Hi.

288
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,160
Oh, my gosh.
Hello.

289
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,560
We'll talk later.
Go ahead.

290
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,200
Hi. Bye.

291
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,840
- Hey.
- Hi.

292
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,280
I'm Matt. This is...

293
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,920
- Sorry. We've got to go.
- No.

294
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,480
Babysitter just rang.

295
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,160
Wee bit of trouble at home
but nothing serious.

296
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,920
- Nothing serious.
- Nothing serious at all.

297
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,320
But you stay.
You stay.

298
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,560
All right.

299
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,880
You enjoy yourself, you miserable cow,
and turn that phone off.

300
00:17:48,881 --> 00:17:51,480
- You working tomorrow?
- Yes, half day.

301
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,360
I can't believe
you give yourself Sundays.

302
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,200
- I'll see you Tuesday.
- Okay.

303
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,240
- Have fun.
- Thanks.

304
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,200
- Bye.
- Bye.

305
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,400
Looks like we've been set up.

306
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,480
Yes.
Sorry.

307
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:08,040
No, it's not your fault.
I mean, I'm fine with it.

308
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,840
I mean, I'm happy
to meet new people.

309
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,720
Yes. Yes. Yes. So am I.

310
00:18:12,721 --> 00:18:14,680
Why don't you sit down?

311
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,080
So, you're Oonagh's boss.

312
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,160
Yes.

313
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,480
I'm saying "yes" a lot.

314
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,720
Uh, yeah.

315
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,520
Sorry.

316
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,120
Would you like another drink?

317
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,960
Uh, sure.
I'll get them.

318
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
No no no, it's fine.
What would you like?

319
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,800
Can I have a, uh-
can I have a glass of white wine?

320
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,280
- Anything dry.
- Dry.

321
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,480
Thanks.

322
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:52,240
- Hey, Mel.
- You all right?

323
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,880
- Andy.
- Nice to see you.

324
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,000
Gwen.

325
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,320
Mum, can you stop-
stop-

326
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,200
Hang on.

327
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,680
Hang on.
I can't hear you.

328
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,280
Just hang on a sec.
Hang on.

329
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,640
Man: That's true.

330
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,560
That's exactly what happens nowadays,
you know?

331
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,560
Hi.

332
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,560
Hey.

333
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,280
- Harvey.
- Jean.

334
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,320
- Harvey, good to see you.
- You too.

335
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,400
- You're looking good.
- Hi.

336
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,360
So our little girl's
getting married.

337
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,160
Harvey, you remember the Watsons.
Barry and, of course, Jill.

338
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,600
- Jill: Hi.
- Barry.

339
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,680
Harvey.

340
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,200
Boy, I haven't seen you guys
since Jean and I, uh-

341
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,720
You look well.

342
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,240
Thank you.
You look weller.

343
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,480
Thank you.

344
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,920
- Barry, you too.
- Thanks, Harvey.

345
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,480
It's good to see you.
How's your son?

346
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,040
- Jean: Daughter.
- Jill: Betsy's fine.

347
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,840
Right.

348
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,400
Sorry.
I got to take this.

349
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,800
Can you hold on, please?

350
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,280
Sorry.

351
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,720
It's gonna take two hours max,
no longer.

352
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,240
Have you told him
it was for me?

353
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,440
Look, we have to go back.
He'll tell you.

354
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,280
Just have him call me, okay?

355
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,480
All right.
I really got to go.

356
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,880
Okay, bye.

357
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,440
Hi.

358
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,320
Kate, sorry.
I bumped into these guys.

359
00:21:02,321 --> 00:21:04,720
Couldn't shake them.
Everyone, this is Kate.

360
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:07,360
- That's okay.
- Andrew, Melissa, and Gwyn.

361
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,640
- Gwen.
- Gwen, sorry.

362
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,000
Sorry. I hope we're not barging in
on you.

363
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,080
Kate: No, no.
Not at all. No.

364
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,960
So, how do you two
know each other?

365
00:21:14,961 --> 00:21:16,640
Um, we don't, actually.

366
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:21,560
We've got some friends in common-
Oonagh and Matt.

367
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,720
And Matt came.
And Kate works with Oonagh.

368
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,920
- They had to rush home.
- Bumped into each other.

369
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,920
Yes.

370
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,880
- Are you on a blind date?
- Yeah.

371
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,640
No. It's not a blind date.

372
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,200
Shall we just leave you to it?
Shall we leave you?

373
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,600
No no no no no.

374
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,160
I mean-

375
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,880
Jeanie, did you move me,
my sweetheart?

376
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,360
- No, darling.
- Dad, I moved you.

377
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,200
I thought it might be easier
if you needed to get up.

378
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,320
Oh, sure.
Okay.

379
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,760
Shall we have a quick toast
just to get things started?

380
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:07,800
I'm going to save my big speech
for tomorrow.

381
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,640
Dear Susan and dear Scott...

382
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,920
I just want to take us all back.

383
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,800
...to that wonderful holiday
that we had in Rome together.

384
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,720
...and wish you salute, eh?

385
00:22:20,721 --> 00:22:23,240
All: Salute!

386
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,320
Because Jean and I
love you both so much...

387
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,680
...and we're so happy that Scott
is gonna be part of our clan now.

388
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:33,440
And so, I say, many, many,
many happy, happy years ahead.

389
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,800
- Salute.
- All: Salute!

390
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,640
Uh, my turn.

391
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:47,640
I thought it was off.
Sorry.

392
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,840
Um...

393
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,000
To a great couple.

394
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,800
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

395
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:04,960
- And cheers again!
- Cheers again.

396
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,040
- Let's eat!
- Scott: Yes! Good idea.

397
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,040
Actually, I'm sorry.
Maybe I should call you dad.

398
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,880
All: Aww!

399
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,880
Harvey.

400
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,200
Hello, Jean.

401
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,720
Could I have a glass of water,
please?

402
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,280
No ice.

403
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,480
Thank you.

404
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,280
Are you okay?

405
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,280
I'm excellent.

406
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,440
Go a little easy,
okay, Harvey?

407
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,680
Why?

408
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,960
Are you afraid I'm going to
embarrass you again?

409
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,720
No, I'm-

410
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,080
I'm afraid you're gonna
embarrass yourself, Harvey.

411
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,200
We're here for Susan.
This is her weekend.

412
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,520
It's Scott and Susan's weekend.

413
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,600
You're good.
You're still good.

414
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,320
I mean, you've always known.

415
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,880
...how to make me feel
like a piece of shit in 30 seconds.

416
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,000
Well, you gave me
a lot of practice.

417
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,280
Why'd you marry me?

418
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,520
I was- I was very young...

419
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,960
...and you were lots of fun.

420
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,080
And how's Brian?
Is he fun?

421
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:13,320
He thinks I'm fun.

422
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:19,320
Harvey, go home now.
Get some sleep, hmm?

423
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,920
Come back,
and see your daughter get married.

424
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,960
Our baby girl's
getting married.

425
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,680
- Hey.
- Hey.

426
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,400
- Susie.
- Dad.

427
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,400
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm great.

428
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,120
- How you doing, huh?
- I'm good.

429
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,640
- You enjoying yourself?
- Mm-hmm.

430
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:04,280
That Scott seems like
a very good guy.

431
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,960
He is.

432
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,040
I'm sorry I haven't had a chance
to talk to you.

433
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,520
No no, don't you worry about me.
I'm fine.

434
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,560
This is about you and Scott.
This is your weekend.

435
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,760
- Huh?
- Yeah.

436
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,440
So, how's work?

437
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,240
Oh, it's all right.
It's, uh-

438
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,520
It's just different.

439
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,880
It's sound design now.
It's not music anymore.

440
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,520
It's a business,
so it's computers and digital...

441
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:29,840
...and you just hit a button,
and it's a triangle chime.

442
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,880
But it's what it is.

443
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,360
Are you still writing
your own stuff?

444
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:37,280
Well, when I get home,
I play a little.

445
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,560
So, listen, um...

446
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:51,560
I'm really sorry to tell you this...

447
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,640
...but I have to
get back to New York.

448
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:58,160
'cause I have
a really important account waiting.

449
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,680
It's very serious.

450
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:06,000
So I won't be at the reception in the
evening, but I will be at your ceremony.

451
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:09,280
That's where you're getting married.

452
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,720
I wouldn't miss that.

453
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,480
Okay.

454
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,400
Uh, Dad...

455
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,600
I've been thinking...

456
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,760
...and Brian's
been a really big part of my life.

457
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,520
...for the past few years...

458
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,120
...and...

459
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,280
I'm gonna ask him
to give me away tomorrow.

460
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,400
I'm sorry.

461
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,440
Okay.

462
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:58,760
I want you to go be with your friends, and I
want you to have a good time...

463
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,040
- And I'm gonna see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

464
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,040
No, but seriously,
I mean, the thing is...

465
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,280
Excuse- Sorry.

466
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,400
Harvey: Right here's good, friend.
Thanks. I want to walk.

467
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:18,200
Excuse me, could you take me
to Wilton Green?

468
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:33,080
By the powers vested in me,
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

469
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:38,040
You may kiss the bride.

470
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,560
To Heathrow.

471
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,520
Spirits?
Champagne?

472
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,080
Okay. Excellent.

473
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,120
Can we go another way?

474
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,800
You're having a laugh,
ain't you?

475
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,160
It'll be bad everywhere.

476
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,480
Sorry.

477
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:01,400
I'm sorry.
I have the 1:30 to JFK.

478
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,000
I'm sorry, Sir.
I'm dealing with a passenger.

479
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,360
- I want to go straight to the gate.
- I will answer all your questions...

480
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,320
- But you will have to wait.
- Okay. Ma'am, excuse me.

481
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,400
- I'm on the 1:30 flight to JFK.
- Sir- Sir, there is a queue.

482
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,800
I appreciate that,
but I'm on the 1:30 flight to JFK.

483
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,200
That flight's now closed.

484
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,000
No no no, the plane
doesn't take off for 40 minutes.

485
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,800
Sir, the gate
is already closed.

486
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,840
But all I have is hand luggage.
Please, just let me through.

487
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,040
- Sir, that is not hand luggage.
- What, this?

488
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,920
- Now will you let me on, please?
- No, Sir.

489
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,240
When's the next flight?

490
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,920
The earliest I can get you on for sure is
tomorrow morning.

491
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,280
- Tomorrow?
- Sir, you're gonna have to stay calm.

492
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,760
Marvin, it's Harvey.
Listen, the traffic was crazy.

493
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,440
I'm gonna have to reschedule slightly.

494
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,160
Come on, Harvey.
The traffic?

495
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,880
- Jesus. Come on.
- Frank can set up.

496
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,320
I'll e-mail them
the queue numbers...

497
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,120
...and then I'll be there at lunchtime
at the latest.

498
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,880
I'll come straight
from the airport.

499
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:51,000
Look, just stay in London, will you? Just
enjoy your daughter's wedding.

500
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,080
No no, Marvin, it's fine.

501
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,720
- There's no problem.
- Harvey.

502
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:57,480
Frank knows exactly what to do, and Mike
is gonna be right there to help.

503
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:00,520
- Harvey, we've got to talk.
No no no. No, listen.

504
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:04,200
I'll be there at lunchtime, Marvin.
It's okay. It's all set up.

505
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,840
- Harvey?
- Yeah? What?

506
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,560
- It's over.
- What?

507
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,280
- What do you mean?
- It's out of my hands.

508
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:14,000
There's people I got to answer to.
I'm letting you go.

509
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:17,760
We'll talk
when you get back.

510
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,760
Hi.

511
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,680
Can I have a Johnnie Walker...

512
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,760
...and if you have a black label,
neat?

513
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,040
Thanks.

514
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,040
Another, please.

515
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,440
It's okay.
Thank you.

516
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,920
Aw, shit!

517
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,360
Sorry.
Vulgar American.

518
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,240
How you doing?

519
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,800
I'm sorry, by the way.

520
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:27,600
For what?

521
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,920
Weren't you the gal who tried to
ask me some questions...

522
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:32,320
...and you were just doing your job,
and I was rude?

523
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,720
I'm sorry.

524
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:39,040
I don't remember, really,
but you probably were.

525
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,520
Most people are.

526
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:44,440
Hmm.

527
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,160
Good book?

528
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,320
Would be
if I could finish it.

529
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,840
Ooh!

530
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,520
- That'll help.
- What?

531
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,320
I said, "That'll help. "

532
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,200
- What? This?
- Mm.

533
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,160
Oh, yes it will,
and it is.

534
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,960
Right.

535
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:11,760
It'll help as much as that trashy novel
and a glass of Chardonnay.

536
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,520
Sorry.

537
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,640
I'm sorry.

538
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,400
I'm sorry.
That was out of line.

539
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:31,080
Go away!
Stop apologizing.

540
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,520
It's just that I've had
a really shitty day.

541
00:34:33,521 --> 00:34:34,800
Join the club.

542
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:38,080
Oh no, yours may have been shitty,
but mine was shittier.

543
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:41,640
Mine was major shitty, you know?
Huh?

544
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,280
How shitty?

545
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,600
I missed the plane, I
lost my job...

546
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,680
...and my daughter,
who's getting married today...

547
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:02,200
...decided that she wanted her stepfather
rather than me to give her away, okay?

548
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,080
And that took it
to major shitty.

549
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,280
Fair enough.
You win.

550
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:15,320
What do you say,
let me make it up to both of us...

551
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,080
...and I'll buy you lunch?

552
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,800
Or tea. How about tea,
if it's teatime?

553
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:24,440
Thanks very much, but I don't know you,
and you don't know me, so-

554
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,880
That's exactly why
we should have tea together.

555
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,560
It's very sweet of you,
but thank you. No.

556
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,720
- Well, you've got your book.
- Mm.

557
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:40,640
If that's for me,
I'm in the shower.

558
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,400
Aren't you gonna answer it?

559
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:51,120
No.

560
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,320
Should I take that
as a hopeful sign?

561
00:35:56,360 --> 00:36:00,880
If it is, you can give me
a little wider smile.

562
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,240
Thank you.

563
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,440
See?

564
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,040
We're having lunch together.

565
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,160
No, we're having lunch
next to each other.

566
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,240
Ah.

567
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,520
By the way,
Harvey - Harvey Shine.

568
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,240
Kate Walker.

569
00:36:44,241 --> 00:36:45,760
So, why aren't you
at the wedding?

570
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:51,760
I knew there was something
that was missing.

571
00:36:51,761 --> 00:36:53,840
I had to get back for work.

572
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,160
What, for the job
you just lost?

573
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,120
Yes, exactly.

574
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:02,280
Did you enjoy it,
the job?

575
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,160
Yes. No.

576
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,840
Yes, originally.

577
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,960
What was it?

578
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,920
I write jingles.

579
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,600
- Wow.
- That's a normal response.

580
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:18,120
Did you always want to write
jingles, or was-

581
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,360
was there something more?

582
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,720
What?

583
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,600
No no, I love it.

584
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,760
You cut right through it.
I like that.

585
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,920
- I'll take that as a compliment.
- You should.

586
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,440
I would have given anything...

587
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,520
...to have been a jazz pianist.

588
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:44,440
Were you good?

589
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,880
No. Not good enough.

590
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:55,760
Sorry.
I... Can be a bit nosy.

591
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,760
Yeah, and I like it.

592
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,800
- Do you believe me?
- Mm.

593
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:08,120
I have to tell you that
is a relief to find someone.

594
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,880
who actually says what they're feeling and
what they're thinking.

595
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,000
Especially in a place
that's supposed to be-

596
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:19,040
...you know -
Britain, English, reserved.

597
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:22,080
Oh, no no. Haven't you heard?
We're a nation changed.

598
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:26,280
Ever since Diana died, we're all sort of
flowing out of us like water.

599
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,680
You guys showed us the way,
actually.

600
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,400
No more
stiff upper lip for us.

601
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,840
And what is that, exactly?

602
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,640
- What?
- "Stiff upper lip. "

603
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,720
I'm not sure,
it's kind of...

604
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,640
...that whole clenched thing.

605
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,880
- Clenched?
- I think so, you know.

606
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,720
See, when you cry,
your lips wobble...

607
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,680
...and when you're being strong,
they don't.

608
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:50,240
Like this.

609
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,640
No, that's sort of
more like a bulldog.

610
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:56,120
No, don't do that. You look like
you've got no teeth at all.

611
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:59,640
It's my first attempt
at a stiff upper lip.

612
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,000
- Who does-
- I don't really kn-

613
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,920
I think it's the sort of tension
in your jaw.

614
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,200
Who does that?

615
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,880
- Aristocrats.
- The aristocrats?

616
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,480
Posh people.

617
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,280
- Thank you. I enjoyed that.
- Me too. Where are you going?

618
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:20,160
- I'm just going to a class, actually.
- What kind of class?

619
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,520
- Writing.
- Ah.

620
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,800
It's just a thing,
twice a week, I do.

621
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:26,080
I've got to get the Heathrow Express,
actually, so-

622
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,680
- I see.
- What about you?

623
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:30,720
I don't know. I guess I'll stay
in a hotel near here.

624
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,720
- I have a flight in the morning.
- Oh, so it's- Yeah.

625
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,520
- Okay.
- Bye-bye, then.

626
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,760
- Bye.
- Good luck.

627
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,640
There's your phone again.

628
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,320
Hello?

629
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,880
Yes.

630
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,560
Harvey: Sorry. I'm sorry.

631
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,640
Sorry.

632
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,320
Hi.

633
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,600
Sorry.

634
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,200
The thought of staying at a hotel
near the runway unnerved me.

635
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,880
- Do you mind?
- No no no.

636
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,800
Excuse me.

637
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,480
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

638
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,400
You ran.

639
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:54,360
Well, I wish you'd been on the car
four cars down.

640
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:58,800
So...

641
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:02,480
- You okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

642
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:06,600
- Where we going?
- Um, Paddington.

643
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,920
Oh.

644
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,640
So, here's the taxi rank.

645
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:20,960
I suppose it's bye-bye again.

646
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,280
Oh.

647
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,960
They'll take you to wherever
you want to go- Any hotel.

648
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
You mean instead of me
walking you to your class?

649
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,520
Carry your books.
I'll throw that in.

650
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,040
Sure.

651
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,440
Is that a "yes"?

652
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,120
Yes.

653
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,360
Why not?

654
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:46,120
In which case, we um-
we have to go-

655
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,640
we have to go back this way.

656
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,160
You mind
if I just drop these off?

657
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,040
Sure.

658
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:21,120
It's like "Yours is a glorious country,
Honeychurch!"

659
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,960
Know that? Line from a book.
"Room with a View. "

660
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,920
Ah. E.M. Forster.

661
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,880
- Mm-hmm. Have you read it?
- No.

662
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,560
- Do you think less of me?
- No no, not at all.

663
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:36,280
It's just- I think
we're just very different.

664
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,000
Probably.

665
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,760
- Is that bad?
- No.

666
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,840
I don't think so either.

667
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,040
Hang on. Sorry.

668
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,320
- Oh, sorry. I should get this.
- Go ahead.

669
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,600
Hello, Mum? Hello.

670
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,960
Sorry. I've been busy.

671
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,680
Yeah.

672
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:57,600
No. I'm out, actually.

673
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:00,360
Yes yes, with someone.

674
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,680
No, with someone else.

675
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,840
Yes, a man.

676
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,080
Oh, you did, did you?

677
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,920
What,
an actual body?

678
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:20,320
Okay, listen.

679
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,280
Listen, I'll come
in early tomorrow morning...

680
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:24,320
...and we'll check it out together,
all right?

681
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:26,600
All right. All right.

682
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,680
Bye-bye. Bye.

683
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,080
Yeah, I love you, too.
Bye. Bye.

684
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:32,640
- Sorry. My mum.
- She worries about you?

685
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,840
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.

686
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,280
Well, about herself, actually.

687
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,720
She's convinced
she's living next to Poland's answer to...

688
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:41,320
- I don't know, Jack the Ripper.
- Oh.

689
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:43,000
Do you live with her?

690
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,960
Oh no. No no no.
God, no.

691
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,080
Near, not with.

692
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:49,080
She's all right.
She means well.

693
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:51,440
She just had
a really rough ride of it is all.

694
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:52,600
Why?

695
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:56,680
Oh, well, my dad ran off to France
with his secretary...

696
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:00,360
...and then, about four years ago, she got
cancer, but she's completely recovered.

697
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,120
She's fine.
She just doesn't want to admit it.

698
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,320
You know.

699
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:05,680
So...

700
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:08,800
...she's bored is what I think it is...

701
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:11,680
...so she's made my situation...

702
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:16,160
which is what she calls me
"being single," her major distraction.

703
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,120
It's like a sort of hobby for her,
if you like.

704
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,600
I see.

705
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,280
Sorry.

706
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,720
- What?
- No. I was just-

707
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:27,800
- I was just talking too much.
- No no, you're not.

708
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:30,000
- No, I am.
- No, you're not.

709
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:34,560
Anyway, we're here.
This is my class.

710
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:39,400
So, how long is your class?

711
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:40,840
An hour.

712
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,640
I can- I can wait.

713
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:49,000
Well, it's getting cold.
You don't want to wait, do you?

714
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,560
Not that cold.

715
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:56,120
Okay.

716
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,040
Careful.

717
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,920
I might get
the wrong impression.

718
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,520
So, uh, how did it go?

719
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,960
Well, the usual.

720
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:32,520
Lovely, mild-mannered Mike
gave us the latest installment.

721
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,800
...from his psychosexual thriller.

722
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,560
He's 86.

723
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:39,880
Shall we keep walking?

724
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:43,080
Okay.

725
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:46,000
It's nice.
It's nice today.

726
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:51,200
Do you ever wish you could just live
a different life just for a day.

727
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,640
...just to see
what it would be like?

728
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,920
Do you have an idea
what yours would be?

729
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,360
Mine?

730
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:02,080
I think it would take place in Spain-
definitely-

731
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,360
...in a little house, inland.

732
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,600
- And what would you do?
- Write a book.

733
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:10,760
I mean, you know,
not "Middlemarch" or anything.

734
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,320
- George Eliot.
- Yeah. Have you read it?

735
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,760
No.

736
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,120
So, your book-

737
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:20,680
Would be just a
really good holiday read...

738
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,240
...you know,
for the beach or a plane.

739
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:23,720
I've got one of those inside me.

740
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,640
And this house that you'd live in-
- Cabana.

741
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:26,880
- Cabana.
- Yeah. Please.

742
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:28,640
Sorry-
that you'd write in...

743
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:30,280
would it have a view?

744
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:33,160
Yes, across the plains...

745
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:37,400
with a little stream running around it
to bathe in.

746
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,080
- Bathe in?
- Mm-hmm.

747
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:41,120
- No showers?
- No.

748
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:45,720
Rustic.

749
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:49,240
Okay okay okay.
I'll adjust.

750
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:52,640
I'm there, only if you're
receiving guests, that is.

751
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,440
Sure.

752
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:01,200
You may visit,
Harvey Shine.

753
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:03,400
Well, thank you,
Kate Walker.

754
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,600
## I'm a guy
that likes his fun ##

755
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,160
## When I fight,
you'd better run ##

756
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:12,160
## I'm a mean, mean, mean
son of a gun ##

757
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:13,800
## I'm going down
to the middle of town ##

758
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:15,560
## I'm gonna shoot
that first man down ##

759
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:19,080
## I'm a mean, mean son of a gun ##

760
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:22,760
## My skin's hard as leather,
I'm as tough as any man ##

761
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:26,360
## When I have to shave myself,
I use an old tin can ##

762
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:29,960
## I wash my face in boiling wax,
scrub myself with a gunnysack ##

763
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,640
## I'm a mean, mean, mean
son of a gun ##

764
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:36,960
## I'm mean,
I'm mean, I'm mean ##

765
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,320
## I'm a mean, mean, mean
son of a gun... ##

766
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:14,120
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

767
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:17,280
What happened between you
and your daughter?

768
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:19,800
Uh, I don't know.

769
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:27,960
Somewhere along the way,
I just lost her.

770
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,520
I woke up one morning,
and I-

771
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:35,720
I realized...

772
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:38,920
...that I didn't belong
in that house.

773
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:44,760
You know, I always had this feeling
in my stomach...

774
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:49,520
...that they were
a bit embarrassed by me.

775
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:03,240
I mean, if you see them now with Brian, my
daughter's stepfather...

776
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:06,560
...you know, they just-
it just makes more sense.

777
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:08,560
I mean, they really look right
together.

778
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:14,600
And I was not
a great father.

779
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,480
Is the wedding reception
still going on?

780
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:31,880
I don't know.

781
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:36,400
Am I still on New York time?
What time is it?

782
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:39,720
About 7::00.
Where is it on?

783
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:41,880
Grosvenor House.

784
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,360
Well, you have to go.

785
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:44,520
- No no no no no.
- Yes, you do.

786
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:45,520
No.

787
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:47,360
No, Harvey.
It's ridiculous you're not there.

788
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:49,200
- You have to go.
- They really don't want me.

789
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:52,960
Harvey, she's your daughter,
and you're her father. You have to go.

790
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:58,200
Harvey, I really mean it.
It's absolutely unforgivable.

791
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,720
You have to go.

792
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:04,360
- Come on.
- I'm thinking.

793
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:05,800
You come with me.

794
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:07,960
No. I-

795
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,560
I can't go
to a wedding reception in...

796
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:13,160
...bloody green polyester.

797
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,800
Are you trying to get me
to buy you a new dress?

798
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:17,760
- Is that what this is all about?
- No.

799
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:19,560
- It is! Yes, it is!
- No, it's not.

800
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:21,960
- I'm not coming.
- Come as my bodyguard.

801
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
- No. No.
- Come as my friend?

802
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:37,800
Okay.

803
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:44,560
I am not spending
more than 200 on that frock.

804
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:48,120
- Is it a deal?
- Yes. Yes.

805
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:50,040
## I'm a guy
that likes his fun ##

806
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:51,800
## And when I fight,
you'd better run ##

807
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:55,680
## I'm a mean, mean, mean
son of a gun ##

808
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,440
## I'm going down
in the middle of town ##

809
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:59,240
## I'm going to shoot
the first man down ##

810
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:02,720
## I'm a mean, mean, mean
son of a gun ##

811
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:06,840
## My skin is hard as leather,
I'm as tough as any man ##

812
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:10,280
## When I have to shave myself,
I use an old tin can ##

813
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:14,160
## I wash my face in boiling wax,
and scrub myself with a gunnysack ##

814
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:17,960
## I'm a mean, mean, mean
son of a gun ##

815
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,320
## I'm mean,
I'm mean, I'm mean ##

816
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:24,720
## I'm a mean, mean,
mean son of a gun ##

817
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:28,840
## I'm a mean, mean, mean
son of a gun. ##

818
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:31,280
Oh.

819
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:33,440
Where was it?

820
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:36,080
Hello.

821
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:19,440
- My ex-wife just clocked you.
- Did she?

822
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:21,600
Huh? Oh.

823
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:23,080
- You should go say hi.
- Okay.

824
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,920
Here comes my daughter.

825
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:29,000
- Hi.
- Hi.

826
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,880
- I didn't go.
- I'm glad.

827
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,520
Uh, this is, uh, Kate.

828
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:36,920
- Oh, hello.
- A friend.

829
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,520
How do you do?
Congratulations.

830
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:40,480
You look fantastic.

831
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:41,520
Thank you.

832
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:43,920
I'm so sorry
I've gate-crashed, actually.

833
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,640
- No, she-
- But it was your father.

834
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,200
He insisted.

835
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:49,800
No no. It's fine.
I'm sure there's room.

836
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:52,480
No no no no.
We'll just fit in wherever.

837
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:54,160
- Excuse me.
- Mm-hmm?

838
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:57,160
- Could you find them a seat?
- Sure.

839
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:00,920
Ladies and gentlemen, could I have
your attention, please?

840
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:03,080
It's time now
for the best-man speech.

841
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:05,480
Oh. Except we seem to be
missing the bride.

842
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:08,680
You may have seen her -
dark hair, white dress.

843
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:11,040
Oh, there she is.
Okay, ladies and gentlemen.

844
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:14,840
Without further ado,
our best man, Pete Turner.

845
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:19,480
- Pete: Thank you, Josh.
- Hi.

846
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:23,080
And thank you, Jean and Brian,
for such a beautiful occasion and for-

847
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:25,120
You do know
this is the children's table.

848
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:27,320
Yes.

849
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:30,040
I'm gonna need to take you
back to the early '90s...

850
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:32,480
when a tall,
far-too-cheerful Chicago man...

851
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:35,400
- Kate: Hello.
- ... walked into my room at Duke...

852
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:38,640
- Bit of a chatterbox.
- Mm.

853
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:43,040
And finally, I'd like to
propose a toast to Susan.

854
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:44,960
...for making
my friend Scott complete.

855
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
All: To Susan!

856
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:49,440
Cheers.

857
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:02,280
Ladies and gentlemen, it's now time
for the father of the bride.

858
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:04,080
...to say a few words.

859
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:05,800
Tonight, that enviable task.

860
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:10,760
will fall to the ever-charming,
ever-distinguished Brian...

861
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:12,520
...ladies and gentlemen.

862
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:23,360
Well, that was
quite some speech, Peter-

863
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,880
quite something to follow.

864
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:29,400
But I will try.

865
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:32,560
- Brian.
- Yes, Harvey?

866
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:34,200
Excuse me for interrupting.

867
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:38,080
I think he said
"father of the bride. "

868
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:40,320
Ah, yes.

869
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,600
May I?

870
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:46,720
Go- Go ahead, Harvey.

871
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:55,040
Hi, everybody.

872
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:56,880
Um...

873
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:59,800
I think there's something.

874
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:04,520
...that Jean and I learned
from our failed marriage...

875
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:09,720
...and that is that it's the children
of divorce that suffer the most...

876
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:15,600
...and the child of Jean and Harvey Shine
has had her share.

877
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:19,000
...of pain and disappointment, but-

878
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:23,440
- ... and this is a tribute to you, Susan
- it has served her well.

879
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:27,680
...because she's somehow
separated herself.

880
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:31,920
...from the fracture
of her birth family.

881
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:37,760
...to become a strong and determined
and independent woman.

882
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:40,560
And yet...

883
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:44,880
...you've kept your sensitivity
and your vulnerability.

884
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:47,880
...and your loveliness...

885
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:50,720
...and you look
quite beautiful tonight.

886
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:01,400
Um...

887
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:06,000
- Scott?
- Hey.

888
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:08,480
You're a lucky guy,
and I'm a lucky guy.

889
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:12,040
...because I'm looking forward
to you being my son.

890
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,880
You are my son-in-law.

891
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:18,440
I've never had a son.

892
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:19,840
Okay.

893
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:22,720
Well, no pressure,
but, Jean...

894
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:26,480
I look forward to grandparenting
with you...

895
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:28,640
...but that's no pressure, Scott.

896
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:34,800
I toast you, Scott.

897
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:38,160
I toast your wife...

898
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:43,080
...my daughter.

899
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:46,240
I toast our family.

900
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:50,600
And if I can just linger
a moment longer...

901
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:56,040
I'd like to hand this back to you, Brian,
with a note of gratitude.

902
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:01,440
Thanks for being there.

903
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:12,280
I would like to ask you all to please stand
up and join Harvey and I

904
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:16,800
- ... in a toast to the bride and the groom
- To Susan and to Scott.

905
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:20,560
Susan and Scott!

906
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:35,680
## Baby, I'm yours ##

907
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:38,200
## And I'll be yours ##

908
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:43,520
## Until the stars
fall from the sky ##

909
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:52,280
## Yours until the rivers
all run dry ##

910
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:59,280
## In other words, until I die ##

911
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:02,720
## Baby, I'm yours ##

912
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:04,600
Harvey. Harvey.

913
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:10,080
## And I'll be yours
until the sun no longer shines ##

914
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:19,560
- Hi.
- Hi.

915
00:59:19,561 --> 00:59:21,880
- Don't cry.
- I won't.

916
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:25,640
Oh, Susan.

917
00:59:25,641 --> 00:59:28,120
Oh, thanks for coming back,
Dad.

918
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:32,080
Thanks for having me back.

919
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:40,280
## Do my best to keep you satisfied ##

920
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:44,120
## Nothing in the world
can drive me away ##

921
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:45,960
Huh? Ready?

922
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,560
Whoo!

923
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:07,640
## Hold it ##

924
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:10,600
## Don't let go ##

925
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:15,320
## Baby ##

926
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:19,640
## Not too slow ##

927
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:38,240
## Higher ##

928
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:41,320
## Make me know ##

929
01:00:41,321 --> 01:00:45,880
## Move it faster ##

930
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:49,040
## Don't let go ##

931
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:06,520
## Don't let go, don't let go,
don't let go ##

932
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:03,280
Is that one of yours?

933
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:04,520
Yes.

934
01:03:04,521 --> 01:03:06,640
It's lovely.

935
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:12,240
Don't go.

936
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:15,640
Okay.

937
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:22,880
- We have to hurry.
- Why?

938
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:25,640
Because I'm gonna dance
your socks off.

939
01:03:57,360 --> 01:03:59,240
Bye! Bye! Bye!

940
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:05,680
Okay!
Oh, the bouquet!

941
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:08,560
Three, two, one!

942
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:11,600
Yay!

943
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:17,080
Have a great time.

944
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:19,520
- Hey!
- Oh, sorry! Bye-bye!

945
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:20,960
Bye!

946
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,440
- Good luck.
- Thank you, and thank you.

947
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:30,200
Crowd: Bye!

948
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:36,920
Bye.

949
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:53,960
- You all right?
- Yes. Yes, I am.

950
01:04:53,961 --> 01:04:57,160
- Do you want to get out of here?
- Sure.

951
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:01,000
Excuse me.

952
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:06,960
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

953
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,800
- Why?
- "Why"?

954
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:10,320
Well, you did
about five different dances.

955
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:12,880
No, no. I mean, why is it called "cutting a
rug"?

956
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:17,320
I love these fountains.

957
01:05:17,321 --> 01:05:19,480
Children play in them
in the summer.

958
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:22,200
They sort of sit on them.

959
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:25,120
They sit their little bottoms down,
and then they get tickled by the water.

960
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:26,760
They love it.

961
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:35,400
I don't think
I've stayed up all night...

962
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:37,800
...since I was a student.

963
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:47,520
You got sad.

964
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:49,240
Why?

965
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:58,560
I was pregnant once.

966
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:00,800
Didn't have it.
I mean...

967
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:05,240
I didn't think twice about it.

968
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:07,640
That's what smart girls did.

969
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:10,120
Yeah.

970
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:14,880
I do...

971
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:19,480
I do sometimes wonder,
you know, wh-

972
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:25,120
whether they would be funny
or clever or...

973
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:30,960
Oh, I don't know...

974
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,200
...neurotic.

975
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,160
Stupid, really.

976
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:40,280
I don't know why
I told you that.

977
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:48,040
Meet me here tomorrow, okay?

978
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:50,720
What?

979
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:54,400
Right here,
right in this spot, noon.

980
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:55,880
Okay?

981
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:59,480
What about your flight?

982
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:04,320
I don't have to go.

983
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:09,280
Why?

984
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:16,200
Oh, shut up, Harvey.

985
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:20,240
Stop it.

986
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:30,400
You think that now,
you wait till tomorrow.

987
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:32,480
Today is tomorrow.

988
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:35,960
Harvey.

989
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:41,520
We don't know anything
about each other.

990
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:43,480
You're, you know-

991
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:45,440
- Old.
- No, I wasn't gonna say that.

992
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:47,760
Well, okay, you're a bit older.

993
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:49,320
I'm...

994
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:53,960
I can be mean.

995
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,960
So can I.

996
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:01,000
No. Truly cantankerous.

997
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:05,360
Cantankerous, I've never been.

998
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:13,600
I should be going.

999
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:17,640
I'm very serious.

1000
01:08:17,641 --> 01:08:21,040
I'll be here waiting at noon,
okay?

1001
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:27,520
Okay?

1002
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:56,000
Harvey Shine.

1003
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:05,640
Tell me what time!

1004
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:07,160
Noon!

1005
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:09,040
I can't hear you!

1006
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:12,000
Noon!

1007
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:49,880
Top o' the morning
to you, Sir.

1008
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:52,320
I'm afraid they're both out of order, Mr.
Shine.

1009
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:53,840
If you wouldn't mind
using the stairs.

1010
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:55,280
I wouldn't mind at all.

1011
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:12,360
Whew!

1012
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:29,280
- Are you okay, Sir?
- Huh?

1013
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:32,320
What's the problem?
Are you okay?

1014
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:33,920
- Uh.
- Can you-

1015
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:37,960
I'm gonna bring you a doctor.
Just wait here, please.

1016
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,120
Shit.

1017
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:41,480
Hey.

1018
01:10:41,481 --> 01:10:45,840
Hey!

1019
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:51,960
- Morning, James.
- Morning, Kate.

1020
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,080
- You all right?
- Ooh!

1021
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:56,480
Actually, can I have, um,
can I have some grapes?

1022
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:58,120
I've got some lovely
seedless grapes today.

1023
01:10:58,160 --> 01:11:00,160
All right, then. Give us a little
bunch- Three quids worth.

1024
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:01,760
- Okeydoke.
- That'll do me.

1025
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:03,000
Thank you.

1026
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:05,720
Man: Clutching his chest?
Yeah?

1027
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:07,760
All right.

1028
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:21,360
Sir, you said that you've been
drinking more coffee than usual.

1029
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:23,280
- Yes, but I have to be somewhere.
- And you're under stress.

1030
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:25,640
- You haven't been sleeping well.
- Yes, but I already told the nurse.

1031
01:11:25,641 --> 01:11:28,360
Please, I've been up all night, I'm under
stress, but I have an appointment.

1032
01:11:28,361 --> 01:11:30,520
Okay, sir, try and calm down.
I just need you to stay tonight.

1033
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:31,800
I have to be somewhere.

1034
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:45,680
It looks to me like arrhythmia,
which is an irregular heartbeat.

1035
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:47,960
Yes. I told the nurse
it's called SVT's.

1036
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:51,160
I've had it since I was a kid, and I left my
medication in New York...

1037
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:53,560
...so if you can just make me out
a prescription for Digoxin.

1038
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:56,520
Digoxin, yeah. That's right.
We can do that, no problem.

1039
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:58,600
First, I just need to rule out
all other possibilities.

1040
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:00,160
No, no. It's arrhythmia.
Please, Doctor.

1041
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:02,200
- I have an appointment.
- I'm 99% sure it is arrhythmia.

1042
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:36,280
Nurse, can you do a 12-lead ECG
and send for tests troponin?

1043
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:38,600
You can't keep me here.

1044
01:12:38,601 --> 01:12:40,480
No. You cannot keep me here.

1045
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:42,360
Also a thyroid function, please.
Thank you.

1046
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:45,520
And can you arrange a monitor bed
for him for tonight?

1047
01:12:58,360 --> 01:13:00,800
Okay, Mama. It's me. Done.
I've got to get to work.

1048
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:05,240
Why don't you stay
and have some lunch?

1049
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:06,800
I can't.
I've got to go.

1050
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:09,120
Not to pry or anything...

1051
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:12,440
...but why is there a large smoked ham under
the stairs?

1052
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:13,920
Oh, that. Yes.

1053
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:16,520
It's, um...
The neighbor gave it to me.

1054
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:18,760
The Polish neighbor?

1055
01:13:20,240 --> 01:13:22,480
So, probably not
a mass murderer.

1056
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:24,240
Probably not.

1057
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:28,200
Are you sure
you're gonna be all right?

1058
01:13:28,201 --> 01:13:32,000
Yeah. Of course I will.
I'll be fine.

1059
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:33,680
Men. Who needs them?

1060
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:35,800
Remember, we've got Greece
to look forward to.

1061
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:37,840
Yeah.

1062
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:43,800
Got lipstick on your face.
See you.

1063
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:46,760
- Morning, Kate.
- Morning, Paddy.

1064
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:49,640
- Lovely as ever.
- Thank you.

1065
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:06,920
Right.

1066
01:14:06,921 --> 01:14:09,120
Okay, thanks a lot.
I appreciate it.

1067
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:10,680
Thank you.

1068
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:21,120
Hello. PSA.
Heathrow branch.

1069
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:24,000
Hello.
Is there a Kate Walker there?

1070
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:26,480
- It's Harvey.
- Hold on.

1071
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:29,320
Kate, it's for you.
Some guy called Harvey.

1072
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:37,960
I'm sorry,
she's, uh, not here.

1073
01:14:37,961 --> 01:14:40,120
Please, this is important.

1074
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:44,080
Kate!

1075
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:47,800
I'm sorry.
She's busy.

1076
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:50,240
She won't come.

1077
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:52,720
Okay, thanks.

1078
01:14:56,680 --> 01:14:59,280
Sir, if I can get you
to sign here.

1079
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:01,160
Sure.

1080
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:05,000
Thank you.

1081
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:09,440
Hello?

1082
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:12,880
Hey, Harvey. It's Marvin.
Where are you?

1083
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:15,040
I'm still in London, Marvin.

1084
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:18,080
Well, you get yourself back here,
my friend.

1085
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:20,640
I got some great news.
You were right.

1086
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:23,560
The Samuelson account,
none of the kids could handle it.

1087
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:24,920
They couldn't nail it.

1088
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:27,280
They ended up picking
one of your old tunes.

1089
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:29,320
They want you to come back
and update it.

1090
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:33,440
We need you back, Harvey.
Your old room's here waiting for you.

1091
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:36,680
Harvey?

1092
01:15:36,681 --> 01:15:39,680
- Oh, well, that's great, Marvin.
- Yeah. Yeah. It's great.

1093
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:41,640
Look, I know
when to eat humble pie.

1094
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:44,520
So, hey, when can you
get back here?

1095
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:45,760
Harvey?

1096
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:49,120
I'm not coming back.

1097
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:50,920
What?

1098
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:52,840
I quit.

1099
01:15:52,841 --> 01:15:54,840
What do you mean you quit,
Harvey?

1100
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:56,240
Look, man, you need us.

1101
01:15:56,280 --> 01:15:59,560
No. You know, I don't.

1102
01:15:59,561 --> 01:16:02,800
As you said, it's my last chance.
Look, I got to go.

1103
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:08,560
Taxi!

1104
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:12,200
Taxi, Heathrow.
I'm in a hurry.

1105
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:36,640
- Hi.
- Hi.

1106
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:38,680
I'm looking for Kate Walker.
Kate.

1107
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:39,880
Who wants to know?

1108
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:43,160
A friend.

1109
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:47,120
Oonagh, there's a man out here
asking for Kate.

1110
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:48,840
- He says "a friend. "
- Yes.

1111
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:51,640
- Friend?
- Well, more than a friend.

1112
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:55,040
- More than a friend?
- Yes.

1113
01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:58,840
- Are you the American?
- Yes, that's right.

1114
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:01,960
She likes you.
I can tell.

1115
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:05,560
Don't you go messing her around, now.
Don't you hurt her.

1116
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:07,800
Oh, I won't.
I wouldn't.

1117
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:11,560
She's not here.
She's left for the day.

1118
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:14,640
You might still find her
at her class.

1119
01:17:14,680 --> 01:17:16,240
In fact, it starts about now.

1120
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:18,360
It's down at the South Bank.
Called the National.

1121
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:20,520
- Yes, I know.
- Oh, you know, do you?

1122
01:17:20,521 --> 01:17:22,360
- Yes.
- Go on. Go and get her.

1123
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:27,480
See you, Harvey.

1124
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:32,800
"The blood oozes from his wound like dark
chocolate on a warm summer's day.

1125
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:36,360
He could still smell her on his glove-

1126
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:40,040
...that deep, penetrating smell of sex.

1127
01:17:40,041 --> 01:17:44,480
It was silent, but with the faint sound of
dripping sweat.

1128
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:47,960
Salt was the taste
that he remembered most-

1129
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:51,680
...so salubrious, so sensual...

1130
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:53,840
...so sexy. "

1131
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,640
Oh, thank you.

1132
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:06,320
Here you go.

1133
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:42,440
- Hey.
- Hi.

1134
01:18:42,441 --> 01:18:43,920
You still here,
still in London?

1135
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:45,520
Sure.

1136
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:49,320
- Can I explain?
- No no.

1137
01:18:49,321 --> 01:18:52,200
- You don't need to explain, Harvey.
- I want to.

1138
01:18:52,201 --> 01:18:53,880
- No, honestly. I don't need to-
- Kate, please.

1139
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:56,720
- I was in a hospital.
- Oh, God. Why?

1140
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:59,000
No. It's nothing.
I left my pills in New York.

1141
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:00,840
I have this irregular heartbeat.

1142
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:03,080
- I had it since I was a kid.
- Arrhythmia.

1143
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:07,360
- How do you know what it is?
- 'Cause my father has it.

1144
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:09,880
Well, young men get it, too.

1145
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:15,040
Aw, Kate, I'm so sorry
I wasn't there.

1146
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:16,760
- Oh, it's fine, Harvey.
- No.

1147
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:20,000
I had a lovely time, Harvey,
and I like you- I really do.

1148
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:21,440
Thank you.

1149
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:24,200
But, you know, I don't really do fountains
at noon either.

1150
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:25,640
I mean, I live in-

1151
01:19:25,641 --> 01:19:27,760
Well, I live in Wilton Green,
and you live in wherever you-

1152
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:29,960
- I live in White Plains.
- Exactly.

1153
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:34,280
And Monday morning, life kicks in,
and we're not teenagers.

1154
01:19:34,281 --> 01:19:37,320
Got a life and our jobs and our family
and everything, and I had a lovely time.

1155
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:40,520
- I won't forget it. Thank you. But-
- What?

1156
01:19:40,521 --> 01:19:43,640
- Well, it's not, you know, real life.
- It is.

1157
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:45,000
- No, it isn't, Harvey.
- It is.

1158
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:49,320
- No, it's not, Harvey.
- No. It is real life.

1159
01:19:49,321 --> 01:19:51,760
- It's real life for me.
- No, no. I know. I know.

1160
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:55,240
But it's not just about you, is it?
It's about me, as well.

1161
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:58,880
You don't know anything about me.
Look at me. I mean, it's pathetic.

1162
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:01,040
I actually expected you
not to show.

1163
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:04,480
In fact, I think I actually almost
wanted you not to show...

1164
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:06,760
...because it's just sort of easier
that way.

1165
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:09,000
You know,
you just dive in there.

1166
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:11,200
You just whoosh anywhere.
It's the deep end...

1167
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:15,400
...and I'm not a bloody swimming pool,
Harvey, and I'm not-

1168
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:17,280
I'm not gonna do it.
I'm not gonna do it.

1169
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:18,760
I'm not gonna do it
because it'll hurt.

1170
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:20,800
Sometime or other, there will be-

1171
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:24,680
...you know, it's not working,
or I need my space, or whatever it is...

1172
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:26,440
...and it will end, and it will hurt,
and I won't do it.

1173
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:27,760
I won't do it,
and I won't...

1174
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:32,440
You see,
what I think it is, is-

1175
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:36,040
...is I think I'm more comfortable
with being disappointed.

1176
01:21:39,080 --> 01:21:42,520
I think I'm angry with you
for trying to take that away.

1177
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,880
Mum, I love you,
but not now.

1178
01:22:09,080 --> 01:22:12,160
Should I take that
as a hopeful sign?

1179
01:22:17,320 --> 01:22:20,440
If you give me
just a little wider smile.

1180
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:24,600
Oh, shut up, Harvey.

1181
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:34,480
So how's this going to work,
Mr. Shine?

1182
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:38,360
I have absolutely no idea.

1183
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:43,400
But it will.

1184
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:49,520
I promise you that.

1185
01:22:52,360 --> 01:22:53,480
Shall we walk?

1186
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:00,160
Yes.

1187
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:21,280
- You okay?
- Uh, yeah.

1188
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:27,760
Hang on a sec.

1189
01:23:30,280 --> 01:23:31,880
Oh.

1190
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:38,280
That's better.

1191
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:40,240
I think
you're my kind of girl.

1192
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:47,880
Why don't you ask me
those questions?

1193
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:49,000
Which ones?

1194
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:51,240
You know, at the airport,
when I avoided you.

1195
01:23:51,241 --> 01:23:53,080
- Oh, the questionnaire.
- Yes.

1196
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:56,480
Oh, okay. Name?

1197
01:23:56,520 --> 01:23:58,120
Harvey Shine.

1198
01:23:58,160 --> 01:24:00,520
Place of residence?

1199
01:24:00,521 --> 01:24:02,920
I'm in transition.

1200
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:35,680
## Where do we go from here? ##

1201
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:39,200
## Where can we hide? ##

1202
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:44,400
## 'Cause I made a U-turn,
and I'm still alive ##

1203
01:24:46,440 --> 01:24:50,240
## Where do we go from here? ##

1204
01:24:50,280 --> 01:24:53,640
## And where did they put
the signs? ##

1205
01:24:53,680 --> 01:24:57,120
## 'Cause I need an exit ##

1206
01:24:57,160 --> 01:25:00,960
## After this life ##

1207
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:04,720
## And where is
this better place? ##

1208
01:25:04,760 --> 01:25:08,200
## And where are
these better times? ##

1209
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:15,080
## And we cannot find ##

1210
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:20,160
- Hi.
- Hello.

1211
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:24,720
I wanted to say thank you
for the ham...

1212
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:28,640
...and sorry for taking so long
to say thank you.

1213
01:25:28,680 --> 01:25:30,160
You're welcome.

1214
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:32,160
- It's smoked.
- Yes.

1215
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:36,520
- Please, come in.
- Oh, no. I can't. I shouldn't.

1216
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:39,320
- I have to...
- Please.

1217
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:44,600
Perhaps, um...

1218
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:47,960
Perhaps you could just show me
how to cut it.

1219
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,840
Absolutely.
Please, come in.

1220
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:57,960
## I've got my foot down,
it's too slow ##

1221
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:07,720
## Ooh, hoo-hoo-hoo ##

1222
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:09,600
## Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo ##

1223
01:26:09,640 --> 01:26:12,280
## Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah ##

1224
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:16,800
## Can you hear me
calling out? ##

1225
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:20,800
## Look how much fun
we had ##

1226
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:24,480
## And now
it's all turning bad ##

it's too slow ##

we had ##
