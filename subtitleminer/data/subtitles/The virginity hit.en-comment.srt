Hey, this is Andrew Gurland,
one of the writer and directors.

2
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:18,974
Huck Botko, the other writer and director.

3
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:21,719
Zack Pearlman, I play Zack.

4
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:23,915
Matt Bennett, I play Matt.

5
00:00:24,557 --> 00:00:27,651
I'm Zack Pearlman's dad, Dr. Pearlman.

6
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:30,421
God, Zack, what is this?

7
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:32,158
I've never seen this movie.

8
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:33,699
I can't wait for you to see it.

9
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:36,600
That's Will Ferrell's voice, right?
Or is that Gary Sanchez?

10
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:40,695
You're asking me?

11
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,198
- Your dad.
- I shouldn't ask my dad.

12
00:00:43,276 --> 00:00:44,903
One thing that I know,
it's gonna be a little bit tough,

13
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:48,675
but it would be awesome
if none of us laughed at our own jokes.

14
00:00:48,748 --> 00:00:49,942
Just other people's jokes.

15
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,675
Only laughing at other people's jokes.
All right, Zack?

16
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:56,381
Lmpossible!

17
00:00:57,657 --> 00:00:58,988
This is the beautiful
Jacob Davich speaking...

18
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:03,894
This is actually funny. They used Hannah
because Hannah is my little sister's name,

19
00:01:03,963 --> 00:01:05,260
and they were just trying to piss me off.

20
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:06,964
- Oh, God!
- I remember that.

21
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:09,160
Poor, sweet, innocent Hannah.

22
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:11,764
Sweet, innocent Hannah!

23
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:14,101
How could you, Zack?

24
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:20,543
Wait, what was the title of the bong?
The Devil Hookah Bong Number Two.

25
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:23,548
Devil Bitch Number Two.

26
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:28,183
You know, people have asked us
if the ritual of the virginity bong

27
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:30,819
is rooted in any of our lives,

28
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,916
and, no, it's something that was
just made up for the script.

29
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:37,224
It's Hollywood, people. Everything's not real.

30
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,757
There's a spiritual bond
between the four of us.

31
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:43,399
Jacob is very spiritual.

32
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:47,964
My daughter wanted to know
why Jacob looked all greasy in that.

33
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:50,271
And we're trying to make it look
like it was a long time ago,

34
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:53,870
so we made everybody change their look.
And you bruised your eye, right?

35
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:58,441
Yeah, I used makeup to make my eye
look like I got punched in the eye.

36
00:01:58,751 --> 00:01:59,809
Trying to make it look like

37
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:02,377
you guys were friends
for a lot longer than you really were.

38
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:05,356
And this is the house
that you guys lived in, for real.

39
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:06,920
Right.

40
00:02:06,993 --> 00:02:10,326
- They put us up in this huge mansion for...
- And that's our maid.

41
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:13,899
No, but, for real. You guys,
in addition to being in the movie together,

42
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:14,991
you were forced to live together.

43
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:16,126
- Yeah.
- It's true.

44
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:17,692
- And what was that like?
- Amazing.

45
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:21,399
I think a lot of the friendship that happens

46
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:28,210
in the movie is true to how good friends
we became while we were filming.

47
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:31,511
When people are mad at each other
in the movie, it's usually

48
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:33,877
in real life we were mad at each other.

49
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:38,279
So the feeling is real in this movie.

50
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:39,791
Did you guys fight a lot?

51
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,620
- Yes. Me and...
- You and Justin fought a lot.

52
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:46,892
- Me and Justin...
- Jacob stayed up in his loft.

53
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:50,802
Jacob had this bachelor's pad.

54
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:54,372
I remember getting a lot of calls
at night from you, Zack,

55
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,671
about being pissed off at somebody,
and you wanted me to get involved

56
00:02:57,744 --> 00:03:00,042
in some kind of argument or something.

57
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,544
It was mostly like...

58
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:06,418
Someone wasn't wearing a condom
when they should have been.

59
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:09,278
Because we had a lot of gay sex.

60
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:11,922
Oh, God! Zack!

61
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:16,157
The one thing I know
about them living in that house

62
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:18,322
is that I didn't get
my security deposit back.

63
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:20,891
I'm a guarantor on the lease,

64
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:23,731
and I'm heavily in debt.
They're remodeling the...

65
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,101
- This woman's the creepiest.
- This lady is real.

66
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:30,704
Everybody in these scenes are real.
This lady was so creepy.

67
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:35,103
The best one was that old lady who was like,
"Are you gonna go buy some diapers?"

68
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:36,805
- Yeah.
- We were like, "What?"

69
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:41,286
And she was like, "Well, you're having sex,
you might as well go look at baby stuff."

70
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:44,151
- Yeah, but that's not...
- Yeah, that makes perfect sense.

71
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,158
- That's on SUPERZACK1000.
- Yeah.

72
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:49,694
And, now, who is this girl over here?

73
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:51,286
- That's Nicole Weaver.
- Yeah.

74
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:53,365
The young, beautiful Nicole Weaver.

75
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:58,904
Nicole still is working in a Friday's
in Flemington, New Jersey.

76
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:00,997
- At this point in time.
- At this point in time.

77
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,975
Which is the Friday... It's September 23?

78
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:05,737
- Something like that.
- Yeah.

79
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:07,904
What do you mean?

80
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:11,540
- As of today, September 23...
- The date.

81
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:15,851
I'm just gonna predict now, since the movie
hasn't really officially released yet,

82
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,947
I'm gonna predict $100 million,
opening week?

83
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:22,491
I'm gonna predict...
I feel like we're gonna beat <i>Avatar.</i>

84
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:25,993
I feel like people
are gonna start calling this movie <i>Avatar 2.</i>

85
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:29,230
<i>- Avatar 2.</i>
- I feel like, guys, it's important...

86
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:32,703
Do not measure the movie's success
in box office performance,

87
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:36,708
but rather in pregnancies
that resulted from people seeing the movie.

88
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:40,004
They've been playing the trailer
during <i>Teen Mom</i> on MTV.

89
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:42,912
- Oh, no.
- Makes me so happy to hear this.

90
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,476
Oh, my sweet Lord!

91
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:48,848
And what did you say was so weird
about this woman? She told a story or...

92
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:52,413
- What was she talking about?
- She talked about her first time.

93
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:54,449
She was like,

94
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:58,759
- "Well, you know, I was 13."
- Wasn't it with an amputee or something?

95
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:00,765
Yeah, so weird.

96
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:03,836
She was like, "He was missing his leg,
'cause he was in the war."

97
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:06,337
That was it. Yeah, he was in the war
and he was missing his leg.

98
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:09,670
"Good thing he wasn't missing his penis,"
she said.

99
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:14,478
And now, these scenes...

100
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:16,378
- This is real.
- That was real.

101
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:18,212
That was Krysta. Krysta really got scared.

102
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:22,087
- That was Davich's idea, I remember.
- That's CGI.

103
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:25,355
That's CGI. That's CGI.

104
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:27,923
- That's real.
- That's green screen.

105
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:31,722
That's CGI. That's CGI.

106
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:36,263
The SUPERZACK flying in,
we filmed that over 14 days.

107
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:44,008
So, this, Zack, you shot off-hours.

108
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:47,945
Yeah, I was trying to get into character
the whole time.

109
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:51,472
So I would actually just grab cameras
and shoot as much as I could.

110
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:53,777
And I bought an HVX,

111
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:57,019
which is a camera
that we ended up shooting a lot on.

112
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,215
And I would shoot on it as much as I could.

113
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:02,318
Yeah, and we actually didn't know
this footage existed until late in the edit,

114
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:04,659
when we were kind of digging through stuff,
and we found it.

115
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:06,231
- Really?
- 'Cause you didn't tell us about it.

116
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:10,201
- And we said, "This is perfect."
- This is awesome.

117
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:13,136
If you guys don't know who Justin Kline is,

118
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,299
he is easily the funniest person
I've ever met.

119
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,367
He's amazing. He does the best characters
and the best songs.

120
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:21,038
He has a song that I just finally heard.

121
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:23,170
The whole song.

122
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:25,078
<i>- Other Places To Put It.</i>
<i>- Other Places To Put It.</i>

123
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:26,379
- So good.
- So amazing.

124
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:28,613
Yeah, well,
Justin is actually an interesting story,

125
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:31,350
because this is his first movie
that he's ever been in.

126
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:33,654
Actually, it's almost everybody's
first movie that they've been in.

127
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:36,194
- Yeah.
- But Justin wasn't even acting before.

128
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:38,890
I believe he was
a production assistant, Huck?

129
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:42,065
He was a PA in New Orleans.

130
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:46,595
And then he ran out of money,
so he went back home to Nebraska,

131
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:49,698
where his parents run
an assisted living home.

132
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:52,509
And he was living there
when we gave him a call,

133
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,846
just to meet him on Skype.

134
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:58,378
And he started playing songs
on his keyboard

135
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:01,887
and was amazingly hilarious and confident,

136
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:04,787
and we said, "Come on down
to New Orleans. Come back."

137
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:07,155
And the other thing
I want to add about Justin

138
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:11,162
is that there were no lines in the script
really written for Justin or Jacob.

139
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:15,098
So, so much of what you see them doing
is just them being themselves.

140
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:17,762
I mean, Matt and Zack, there was very much
a script and a structure for,

141
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:21,432
but they truly carved out their parts
out of nothing.

142
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:24,635
Every line you hear from Justin
is just pure Justin.

143
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:28,874
- He is the best.
- He was always so awesome.

144
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,074
He is awesome.

145
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:33,886
Jacob has probably the most film experience

146
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,147
of anybody in the movie at 18,

147
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:39,020
because he starred as
the young Howard Hughes in <i>The Aviator.</i>

148
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:42,151
- And he will never let you forget it.
- Really?

149
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:44,453
- That's actually me.
- That's baby Zack.

150
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:47,090
This is amazing that they found
footage of both of us.

151
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:49,592
- Playing mini-golf. That's actually me, too.
- That's really cool.

152
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:50,795
On what looks like the same course.

153
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,565
Which just means our parents are obsessed

154
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:56,699
- with recording the stupidest stuff.
- I love you, Zack.

155
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:59,744
I gotta say that's my real mom.
That's Gina Bennett.

156
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:02,873
- The young girl in front of Matt.
- She's actually not really dead.

157
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:06,817
- Well, she's not as dead as...
- Dead inside.

158
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:12,215
At the failure that her son became,
made her dead inside.

159
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:16,056
You know, I have a lot more footage
of Zack playing miniature golf,

160
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:18,596
if you want to put it in the movie.

161
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:19,995
It's cut, Dad. Dad, the movie's cut.

162
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:22,330
Speaking to that section,
on the way it looks like

163
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:23,993
those two guys are miniature golfing.

164
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,595
It's really amazing
and that's a testament to Geoff Richman,

165
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,697
who really went through
everybody's home movies

166
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:31,607
and created this feeling
that these guys grew up together,

167
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:32,803
which was really crucial

168
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:36,178
for people dialing into
the characters' relationship with each other.

169
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,476
Andrew, you're really doing
a commentary track?

170
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:42,349
- Yes, I am. Sorry.
- That's awesome.

171
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:45,187
- I like the cut of your jib.
- That's real love in Nicole's eyes.

172
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:47,089
She was really in love with me.

173
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:51,796
- Well, I do think that Nicole...
- That bird is the passing of this movie.

174
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:52,498
- What?
- Just how it soars overhead,

175
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:54,693
- What?
- Just how it soars overhead,

176
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:58,093
unannounced, but everybody loves it
and watches it.

177
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:01,599
Does anyone remember
what day of shooting...

178
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:02,971
Guys, I'm on mushrooms.

179
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:05,173
Does anyone remember
what day of shooting...

180
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:07,541
- This was before...
- Forty?

181
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:10,241
...we actually officially started.
- This is the first day that we actually

182
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:13,308
- got to New Orleans.
- I think this was the 17th?

183
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:16,617
- This was the first day of shooting...
- This was before principal photography.

184
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:18,953
- This was before principal?
- Yes. This is negative...

185
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:20,788
Yeah, I think it was the 17th of May.

186
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,384
- You remember the date?
- Yeah.

187
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:23,860
But the point is we hadn't
done anything yet.

188
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,761
Because two days later, I turned 21.

189
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:29,198
Yeah. So, this is Justin actually shooting...

190
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:33,464
Our DP hadn't got down yet,
so we wanted to get warmed up.

191
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:34,971
And so we went to Kenner,

192
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:37,607
and we said,
"Go to the parking lot and do the scene

193
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:40,145
"where you find out
that Nicole cheated on you."

194
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:44,746
And then what you don't see is,
right at the end of the scene,

195
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:46,011
- is when the cops show up.
- Yeah.

196
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,212
'Cause they saw Matt
chasing Zack around the field.

197
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:51,154
That area was supposedly really, really bad,
and there had actually been

198
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:52,986
a murder committed with a baseball bat.

199
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:56,517
And somebody saw me chasing Zack
with a baseball bat.

200
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:58,653
They called the cops on us.

201
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:05,368
But, yeah, that was the first day,
and Justin was actually shooting,

202
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:08,868
and he was acting while he was shooting,

203
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:11,808
and that was how we achieved
the documentary feel of this movie a lot,

204
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:15,074
is having characters actually shoot it
and acting behind the camera.

205
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:16,238
Yeah.

206
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,413
I like it best when Zack's shooting.

207
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:24,752
- I'm gonna ask my dad to leave.
- What?

208
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:29,584
Now, this guy was wearing a shirt before.
I asked him to remove it,

209
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:31,926
because I wanted to give
the ladies something.

210
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:34,663
The penis shot.

211
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:37,396
We were getting a lot of crap
about how there wasn't,

212
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,028
from our wives and other women,

213
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:41,471
there was nothing for the ladies.

214
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:45,801
- And this wiener shot is also for the ladies.
- What?

215
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,642
There's a wiener shot?

216
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:52,115
One of my favorite comments
was on Twitter.

217
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:56,052
One of the guys was like, "Usually,
you pay a stripper to leave, not to stay."

218
00:10:56,288 --> 00:11:00,349
This whole scene just went
right over that guy's head.

219
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,687
- Hey, I got pickle juice all over me now.
- Harry!

220
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:06,487
- Zack, what's Twitter?
- That's Danie Coleman.

221
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:09,762
- Danie Coleman and Harry Zittel.
- The great Danie Coleman.

222
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:10,824
She was so funny.

223
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:14,862
Harry Zittel, actually,
was the original person...

224
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:17,575
He's an original man.

225
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:20,305
- He's an original man.
- Original man.

226
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:23,609
- Yeah.
- He's my baby boy.

227
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,049
Bouncing baby boy.

228
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:29,849
I think there is something to say
about Monique dressing this house

229
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:32,356
to look like an actual frat.

230
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:35,417
Yeah, this was actually
an apartment building.

231
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:39,694
And we made it look like a frat house
and Monique really did an incredible job.

232
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:41,824
This wasn't a kitchen
when we found it, either.

233
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:44,392
That was just an empty room, so...

234
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:47,099
I mean, she killed it.

235
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:49,266
Just nailed it.

236
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:53,277
Now, this shot over here is something
that Huck and I have been dealing with

237
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:55,809
over and over again in our short films

238
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:59,078
and other feature work,
where we just pull out

239
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:00,618
to have somebody else watching something.

240
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:02,813
Always trying to figure out
a new way to do it.

241
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:04,981
There we had it on the actual

242
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:08,255
Handycam pull-out.

243
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:12,492
Looks yummy. Cookies?

244
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,863
You used to make cookies all the time...

245
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:18,897
I remember doing this scene
and I kept eating cookies,

246
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:21,769
and Andrew was like,
"Don't do it with your mouth full."

247
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,236
And I refused to not eat cookies.

248
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:27,438
Yes, and also I remember
during the birthday party scene,

249
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:28,980
Matt's birthday party.

250
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:31,573
Even though you were off-camera,
you were eating cake the whole time.

251
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:34,118
I was eating cake the whole time.

252
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,952
Here we go.
There's me actually grabbing a cookie.

253
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:38,080
Yeah.

254
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:41,058
Zack has both a sweet tooth
and a savory tooth.

255
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:46,928
And I also have a tooth...
I tried to knock out my sweet tooth.

256
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,094
Just gets sweeter whenever you hit it.

257
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:51,627
That's the dumbest joke I've ever made.

258
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:53,128
Not true.

259
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:55,173
I tried to get Zack on Jenny Craig.

260
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:58,799
- Grab the camera. You got it?
- Yeah.

261
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:02,980
This band playing right now,
Lightning Love,

262
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:07,212
is from Ypsilanti, Michigan,
which is from my hometown.

263
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,151
Well, right next to my hometown, Ann Arbor.

264
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:13,189
And funny enough, the dude, Ben Collins,
who's in the band,

265
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,926
is one of my good friends.

266
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:19,357
And it was complete coincidence
that he ended up in the movie.

267
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:22,295
He used to come into the house
with a backpack, go up the stairs.

268
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:24,962
I was like,
"What was in that goddamn backpack?"

269
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:26,766
I knew it was something bad.

270
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:29,197
Drugs or pornography.

271
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:35,106
This sequence of Zack throwing Krysta
in the pool is indicative

272
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:37,979
of what really inspired Huck and I
to start the project in the first place.

273
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:42,487
We started watching all these clips
of teenagers throwing girls in pools,

274
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:47,082
and we were like, "God, I just wanna know
who these kids are and have a whole movie

275
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,490
"that exists in this world."

276
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:53,589
So this is really the genesis
of this whole big mess that we made.

277
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:56,666
Girls in pools.

278
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:58,767
- That was the original title of the movie.
- Yeah.

279
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,271
Our first cut that we showed...

280
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:03,399
The first notes we got back were,
"There's too much pool stuff."

281
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:06,375
We had all sorts of pool stuff in the first cut.

282
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:09,471
The second note was that
there's too much poop stuff.

283
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,609
We shy away from that.

284
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:15,678
- Have sex with her there.
- Go on the date.

285
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:18,854
And that's Krysta Rodriguez.

286
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:21,889
- The beautiful.
- You could see her on Broadway.

287
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:24,823
Anybody want to finish that?

288
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:27,291
As Wednesday Addams
in <i>The Addams Family.</i>

289
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:30,733
She was also in <i>Spring Awakening</i>
and <i>In The Heights.</i>

290
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:34,031
- And in my bedroom.
- And in my dreams.

291
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,502
- She's a very lovely human being.
- She's the best.

292
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,171
I love Nathan Lane.

293
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:45,816
Zack, I've never told you that,
but I love Nathan Lane.

294
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:51,016
I was feeling kind of sick, kind of ill.

295
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:55,358
And now, this house... That's all I got.

296
00:14:57,496 --> 00:14:59,828
This house had so much porn in it.

297
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:03,232
It was like loose-leaf paper
just strewn about. It was crazy.

298
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:06,601
This was a separate house
from what they made us live in.

299
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:10,199
This was some weird house
on some backward street,

300
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:12,676
and there was porn everywhere.

301
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,872
I don't know. Porn everywhere.

302
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:17,211
This is actually right near the house.

303
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,309
- Yeah.
- This is a cool location.

304
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:23,378
And now, let's talk about Sunny Leone
for a second.

305
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:27,221
Now, had any of you heard of Sunny Leone
before the movie?

306
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:28,624
Were you guys aware of her?

307
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:31,561
No, I thought she was a robot
the whole time.

308
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,393
No, but I'm saying,
I don't know if you guys know anything

309
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:36,491
about the adult entertainment universe.

310
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:40,436
I mean, everyone either takes dick
or gives dick.

311
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:43,566
That's adult entertainment?

312
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:44,944
Let's clean it up a little, young man.

313
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:49,579
Sorry. Penis.
Everybody takes penis or gives penis.

314
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:52,645
- This place rules.
- I've never heard of Sunny Leone.

315
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:55,652
Never heard of her
or seen any of her movies

316
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:57,750
or downloaded them.

317
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,319
What is browser history?

318
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:03,718
Gosh, it's John.

319
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,890
- Was this scripted?
- Yeah, this was scripted.

320
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:07,990
I forget.

321
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:09,932
You know, I don't know if it was
in the script.

322
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:14,234
I think it was stuff that we were just feeding
right before.

323
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:17,070
- The innkeeper was in the script.
- Yeah, yeah.

324
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:19,872
The idea, but what he was saying,
that was mostly improv.

325
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:22,037
- There was a lot of improvisation.
- And he just owned it.

326
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:25,480
And actually,
he added me on Facebook recently.

327
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:28,179
And I went to look at his pictures,
stuff that he's done.

328
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:30,983
There was a picture of a shoot that he did,

329
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:33,422
he played an ax murderer after this,

330
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:36,186
and it was pictures of him
with decapitated women.

331
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:37,785
- It was just really funny.
- I think he gets that a lot.

332
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:41,890
- I think we allowed him to stretch a little.
- Yeah, and he was great.

333
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:45,035
My favorite thing that he did,
and it didn't end up in the movie,

334
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:49,336
is when he said, "I wanna show you guys
a trick that I learned in the Army."

335
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,669
And then he just took off his pants.

336
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:55,872
That was so awesome!
'Cause that was when everyone was there.

337
00:16:55,981 --> 00:16:59,849
All the girls and everyone sort of screamed.
It was so funny.

338
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:02,045
Everyone started screaming.

339
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:04,912
- It was chaos.
- That was the most fun having him.

340
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,821
- He has a bolo tie on, I just realized.
- Yeah.

341
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:11,261
Because you never knew how things
were gonna come out of his mouth

342
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,730
before he said them,
and so every time it was a surprise.

343
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:18,031
This laugh, I had no idea
it was gonna come out like this at all.

344
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:22,640
We knew he was gonna do it,
but his interpretation of it was insane.

345
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,504
I could literally just watch this.

346
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:30,139
Yeah, and another thing
with the old-timers' joke,

347
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:34,049
we've screened the movie a bunch of times,
and sometimes people go crazy

348
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:37,885
and sometimes people are
so uncomfortable and nervous,

349
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:41,414
and it's like you just never know
how that's gonna play.

350
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:44,628
Let's count down to my stupid face. Ready?

351
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:48,257
- Five, four, three, two, one.
- Four, three, two, one.

352
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:53,133
You're beautiful, Zack. You're as beautiful
as the day you were born,

353
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:55,673
coming out of your mother's vagina.

354
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,403
Face stretched, smiling at the world.

355
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:03,308
- I was born with alopecia.
- Now, Matt, a lot of times in this movie,

356
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:06,579
you have to act uncomfortable or uptight.

357
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,584
Was that a stretch for you
at that point in your life?

358
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:11,179
No, it was not.

359
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:16,353
No, I don't know.
It was a pretty awkward shoot. Yeah.

360
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,862
Actually, I'd say
he's the most established actor.

361
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,057
- Yeah, yeah.
- David.

362
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,530
But he's been in every Soderbergh movie.

363
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,127
- Not true.
- A lot of them.

364
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:28,002
- He's been in a couple.
- He's been in a couple.

365
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:30,200
- He's a terrific, terrific guy.
- Yeah.

366
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,937
And I'm really upset that they cut
the neck brace thing.

367
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:34,373
- Yeah.
- That was awesome.

368
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:37,472
If you watch
in one of the next coming shots,

369
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:42,953
there's gonna be a big TV,
and to the left of it is a neck brace.

370
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:46,582
There's a whole story he was giving
about how he broke his neck.

371
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:48,489
Oh, gosh, I forget it.

372
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,552
It was like he was gonna take two years,
but he did it in eight months.

373
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:53,597
But this is a much better bit.

374
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:55,656
Whose idea was this?
'Cause this wasn't in the script.

375
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:58,726
It was David Jensen.
He's really into those green smoothies.

376
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,796
But he understood
how inherently funny they are.

377
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:03,705
This was so awesome.

378
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:04,969
He brought the gear and everything.

379
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:07,671
- He was just like, "I'm bringing my stuff."
- He showed up with the blender,

380
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:10,010
with the vegetables and just said,
"Hey, I wanna do this."

381
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:11,913
We're like, "Great!"

382
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:16,783
And as far as the neck brace,
it was kind of that or the neck brace.

383
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:20,757
- You can't really just do...
- Two crazies. Here's the neck brace.

384
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:21,815
There it is, right behind my head.

385
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:25,159
I feel like David broke character a little bit
when he goes, "Hubba-hubba."

386
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,959
That's funny.
I think it was one of the funniest lines.

387
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:29,227
- I think it's so good.
- Yeah.

388
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:33,169
He broke character, but he showed his own.

389
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:35,798
- It's because he's...
- Neck brace.

390
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:38,104
- He saw Nicole's feet.
- Yeah.

391
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:44,239
And that car, that van,
was the worst place in the world.

392
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:46,784
That van smelled like poop.

393
00:19:47,152 --> 00:19:50,952
Well, it was the hottest place on Earth
'cause there was no AC,

394
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:56,086
and we were in that van a lot,
hiding Tammy, our sound person,

395
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:58,823
in crazy places and it was awful in there.

396
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:00,994
- Awful, awful.
- Tammy!

397
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:02,566
Tammy was my favorite.

398
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:06,263
Now, in this scene coming up,
you guys have all these...

399
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:10,841
There's a lot of extras, a lot of girls
that were re-occurring extras in the movie.

400
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:13,605
Did you guys develop any friendships
with those young ladies?

401
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,410
- Yeah, a lot of them.
- Yeah, there's Mallory Slack.

402
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:19,814
- She's really great.
- Mallory Slack, Kathleen Barnes.

403
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,409
- Amanda Punch.
- Amanda Punch.

404
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:25,286
Amanda Punch has come and visited
in California a whole bunch.

405
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:30,517
She came to Thanksgiving.
She ate all the pearled onions.

406
00:20:32,197 --> 00:20:37,191
I love pearled onions. It's the only thing
I want at Thanksgiving. She ate them all.

407
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:38,730
Zack.

408
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:46,775
- Did we just do the same thing?
- We just yawned at the same time.

409
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:48,803
We're so lame.

410
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:53,876
Matt and Nicole,
they didn't know we were filming.

411
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:56,420
They were actually going to dinner.

412
00:20:57,289 --> 00:21:00,019
And then I asked the dumbest question.

413
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:01,793
Let them pop it.

414
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:06,021
- Idiot.
- Well, that's part of your charm, Zachary.

415
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,726
Is that I'm an idiot, idiot.

416
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:11,291
That's what I've always said about you, Zack.

417
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:14,669
This is one of my favorite parts
'cause this was never...

418
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:18,369
Jacob Davich just wanted
to jump over everything.

419
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:23,312
We must have shot this four times where
Jacob is like, "You want me to jump this?"

420
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,951
Yeah. A lot of the stuff,
we were not in the room,

421
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:33,253
and Zack was just shooting,
and guys were just hanging out for real.

422
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:38,620
That's her.

423
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:40,631
- That's Amanda.
- That's who ate all the onions.

424
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:42,155
Golly!

425
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:45,370
<i>Checking. We're by the bed.</i>
<i>Can you hear this?</i>

426
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:48,095
It's Dacia, right? Dacia? Dacia?

427
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:52,574
Dacia. And there's me
actually laughing at what they're saying.

428
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:57,080
Kathleen Barnes.

429
00:21:57,582 --> 00:21:59,311
Devil Bitch. Weed.

430
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:02,410
And, now, did you guys smoke any weed
during the making of the movie?

431
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:04,250
- No.
- What was that?

432
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:06,649
That was called Wizard's Brew.

433
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:10,855
- It was like herbs.
- It was the harshest...

434
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:12,362
It was like smoking cardboard.

435
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:16,265
It was my least favorite part of filming,
the Wizard's Brew.

436
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,825
That and being wet.

437
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:21,099
Yeah. That's my pet peeve.
I hate being wet.

438
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:24,432
- Matt never takes showers.
- No, no.

439
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:29,474
I do what's called the whore's bath,
which is I take a wet wipe...

440
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:37,618
He used my car shammy when he slept over.
Wiped himself down with a ShamWow.

441
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:43,024
- My dad invented the ShamWow.
- That's goddamn right.

442
00:22:43,128 --> 00:22:46,427
- For 'ginas.
- That's right.

443
00:22:49,334 --> 00:22:51,598
- I remember...
- Who is that guy?

444
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:55,333
He had the same name
as either Justin or Jacob.

445
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:57,467
That's all I remember.

446
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:00,909
Since I didn't film it, I never met the guy.
And I was watching this in the theater.

447
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:03,038
- Who is that guy?
- Now, a lot of people...

448
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:04,673
- That's Cheese, man.
- That's Cheese.

449
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,583
That's my illegitimate son.
Zack, I never told you.

450
00:23:07,652 --> 00:23:08,744
He looks so much like you.

451
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,687
You guys want to talk about Cheese?
Like why we invented Cheese?

452
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:14,555
There's another guy in the mirror, too.

453
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:16,787
- Who is that?
- I think it was me, Andrew, Huck,

454
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,795
Justin and Amy Hobby.

455
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:24,967
We all went out to the swamps
and I was loopy,

456
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:29,405
and I was talking about a movie,
a new cop-buddy movie

457
00:23:29,474 --> 00:23:33,467
- called <i>Hotko and Cheese.</i>
- 'Cause Huck Botko's...

458
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:36,776
Huck Botko, if you switch it, it's Buck Hotko.

459
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:40,681
And that sounds like a perfect
'80s cop name.

460
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,276
"Babe, what's up? I'm Hotko."

461
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:47,155
And then Cheese is like the slack buddy.

462
00:23:47,225 --> 00:23:49,193
Always has French fries
coming out of his pocket.

463
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,229
I have a feeling that's not what Huck meant.

464
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:53,890
That's not. Yeah.

465
00:23:53,965 --> 00:23:56,490
- There's no way.
- But very good.

466
00:23:56,568 --> 00:23:59,002
But Cheese ended up being the fifth friend.

467
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:02,597
Right, because whenever you guys
had to do exposition on the phone

468
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:04,904
or tell part of the story,
and you needed someone to talk to,

469
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:07,137
- you would always call Cheese.
- Cheese.

470
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:08,509
And it made it in.

471
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:11,378
Usually it was Huck or I talking to them,

472
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:14,183
trying to get them to say
what we wanted them to say.

473
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:16,220
But they would pretend
like it was one of their friends.

474
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,017
- So I think that's what Huck meant.
- Right.

475
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:23,527
We had no idea about any of that other
great stuff you guys were talking about.

476
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,623
We had an interesting set,

477
00:24:25,697 --> 00:24:28,860
where usually you're supposed
to turn your cell phones off,

478
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:31,732
but we wanted all the actors
to have their cell phones on,

479
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:35,034
so that if we wanted to be in the other room
and kind of give some distance,

480
00:24:35,106 --> 00:24:38,769
we could call into the room
and give directions that way.

481
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:42,109
So when you see people on the phone,
it's probably us calling in.

482
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:46,276
If you watch,
I have the oldest cell phone in the world.

483
00:24:46,384 --> 00:24:50,184
- I have a little brick.
- I gave it to him. That was my old cell phone.

484
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:52,689
It didn't accept text messages,
that's how old it was.

485
00:24:52,757 --> 00:24:56,454
I engraved it,
"To Zack. Love, Dad. Call me, please!"

486
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,657
I loved that phone.

487
00:25:03,301 --> 00:25:05,792
Oh, my God! She's in her underwear.

488
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:14,002
This is The Columns Hotel.
You may recognize it

489
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:16,743
if you've been down to New Orleans.
It's very lovely.

490
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:18,908
I murdered a mistress there.

491
00:25:19,484 --> 00:25:21,213
Don't tell your mother, Zack.

492
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:24,744
She's gonna find out.
You just said it on a commentary.

493
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:29,658
Tell your mother not to watch
the commentary.

494
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:32,253
It's gonna make her more suspicious.

495
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,531
- Nicole bringing it.
- I know.

496
00:25:36,601 --> 00:25:39,195
Nicole crying every single time.

497
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:41,136
I can't watch girls cry.

498
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:42,798
- Makes me so sad.
- She's amazing.

499
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:45,842
Now, you helped her cry a little bit.
Is that right?

500
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:47,769
I punched her.

501
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:51,643
No, I know that you helped her
get to that place.

502
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:55,914
- Can you talk about that a little?
- I told her that she broke my heart,

503
00:25:55,987 --> 00:25:58,649
and I hate her,
and I will never get back with her.

504
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:03,120
When she first auditioned, she came in
and told me that she was in love with me.

505
00:26:03,194 --> 00:26:06,891
And was totally in character forever.

506
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:08,798
And I don't know,

507
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:13,463
I just told her terrible little things
that I wish I could take back.

508
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:19,068
David Jensen had eight different ones.

509
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:20,475
Yeah, did you know that was coming, Matt?

510
00:26:20,545 --> 00:26:22,347
- No.
- We did a whole bunch of different ones.

511
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:25,142
There's also one where he took off
my glasses and stomped on them.

512
00:26:25,216 --> 00:26:26,706
That was awesome.

513
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:29,445
What else did he do? Did he fake-punch me?

514
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:31,648
- He punched you a couple times, yeah.
- Yeah.

515
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:35,159
But the throw was completely by surprise,
right? You had no idea that was coming.

516
00:26:35,226 --> 00:26:37,854
No, I had no idea.
He just started walking me.

517
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:40,227
I thought he was gonna walk me to his car,
you know?

518
00:26:40,298 --> 00:26:42,994
Were you intimidated by him at all
during that scene?

519
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:44,092
Absolutely.

520
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:47,104
He's a method actor, so he's not afraid.

521
00:26:47,172 --> 00:26:51,438
The scene where we break into his house
and he starts hitting me.

522
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:53,204
- He grabs my head.
- Talk about it then.

523
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,143
- Talk about it then.
- Okay, I'll talk about it then.

524
00:26:55,213 --> 00:26:58,376
I don't have to say it. He actually hit me.
That's basically it.

525
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:02,147
I would love for someone,
for this to be their first viewing of the movie.

526
00:27:02,387 --> 00:27:06,949
They're like,
"None of the voices are syncing up."

527
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:10,927
This is Lee, and he is a mechanic
for Continental Airlines.

528
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:13,259
- Is he?
- But he loves movies

529
00:27:13,331 --> 00:27:15,822
and he wanted to come down.

530
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:18,465
He and John McLeaish.
That was the same day, right?

531
00:27:18,536 --> 00:27:19,935
Yeah, they came together from Shreveport.

532
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:23,463
They drove down together. They're buddies.
So, the innkeeper and Lee are good buddies.

533
00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:24,667
I didn't even know that.

534
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:29,112
I love this.
There's some old guy right next to me.

535
00:27:30,615 --> 00:27:33,277
Seth Barrish writes songs for kids.

536
00:27:33,618 --> 00:27:34,915
- He does?
- Yeah, he does.

537
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,214
- Really?
- He played music.

538
00:27:36,287 --> 00:27:38,812
- They're actually pretty good songs.
- They are really good.

539
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:40,551
I was surprised. I was like, "Oh, no!"

540
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:42,957
He was like, "I write songs for kids."
I was like, "Oh, no, Seth, no."

541
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:45,053
And they were really good.

542
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:48,691
Seth Barrish, the New York actor.
He was recently in <i>Margot at the Wedding.</i>

543
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:49,859
- Is that correct?
- That looks like Adam.

544
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:52,300
- That old guy?
- Yeah, like his dad.

545
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:56,170
- Like Adam McKay's dad?
- Yeah, that's who I'm guessing it is.

546
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:59,071
Best birthday present, ever.

547
00:28:01,212 --> 00:28:04,978
I like that Seth says "man" and "dude" a lot.

548
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:08,042
This was actually one of the more
complicated scenes for us

549
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:09,984
to get right, editing-wise.

550
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:16,585
And I remember that it was
originally scripted that the lingerie,

551
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:19,186
or the Sunny Leone panties,
were in the beginning of the scene,

552
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:22,165
and then it got dramatic at the end.
And it always was a real momentum problem

553
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:26,829
for us and we ended up inverting it
and ending with the comedy,

554
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:30,068
and then it just flowed much better
after that.

555
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:32,803
Bernard kills in this scene
with his lines, too.

556
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:36,244
- Bernard, Zack's dad.
- Zack's fake dad.

557
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:39,640
I'm his real father.

558
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:43,882
I remember when we were shooting
the first time with Bernard and Ramona,

559
00:28:43,955 --> 00:28:46,788
the parents, we could hear everything

560
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:48,416
that they were saying
'cause they were miked.

561
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:51,724
It was in the house,
and we were wandering between rooms.

562
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:55,892
I remember Bernard saying to Ramona,
"What are they doing?"

563
00:28:55,967 --> 00:28:57,867
'Cause we just started shooting off script.

564
00:28:57,936 --> 00:29:00,496
They said, "Are they gonna tell us
what to do, or are they just gonna

565
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,699
"keep walking around? Are they shooting?"

566
00:29:02,774 --> 00:29:05,436
I was very confused for about an hour,

567
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:10,074
and then by the time we hit this scene,
this scene was a half hour one-take,

568
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:13,743
everybody was on their game,
just totally improvising.

569
00:29:13,818 --> 00:29:17,754
And I think after it was done, we all
just stood up and gave them an ovation,

570
00:29:17,822 --> 00:29:21,588
- because it was just like a one-act.
- Matt!

571
00:29:21,826 --> 00:29:25,421
Dude, do you remember that crazy lady
who wanted to take pictures with us?

572
00:29:25,663 --> 00:29:27,096
- No.
- You don't?

573
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:28,867
- No. After that my hands smelled so weird.
- Can I tell the story?

574
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:30,562
- No. After that my hands smelled so weird.
- Can I tell the story?

575
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:35,403
Why did your hands smell weird?

576
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:37,572
No, my butt!

577
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:40,202
We did a whole bunch of these
where tissues were all over the bed.

578
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:41,677
Yeah, that was a good one.

579
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,416
I don't know the story. I forgot this.

580
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:49,183
We were filming that scene outside,
that isn't in the movie.

581
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:51,745
It was the scene outside that was

582
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:53,586
you talking to your dad
trying to get the photo albums.

583
00:29:53,658 --> 00:29:55,455
- Zack, I don't care.
- Okay.

584
00:29:57,162 --> 00:30:01,326
- That's the beautiful Savannah Welch.
- Oh, my God! I love Savannah.

585
00:30:01,766 --> 00:30:04,667
No one loves Savannah
like Savannah loves Savannah.

586
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:06,829
- What does that mean?
- I don't know. Doesn't mean anything.

587
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:09,237
- That's not true.
- That's not true at all.

588
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:11,298
I mean, I love myself
probably more than anyone else loves me.

589
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:13,207
- That is true.
- I just wish she would add me on Facebook!

590
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:16,247
- Zack, don't take this the wrong way...
- That is true.

591
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:20,751
Zack, don't take this the wrong way,
but I would leave my family for her.

592
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,844
Don't take it the wrong way,
and don't tell your mother.

593
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:26,015
Or Hannah. Sweet Hannah.
God, sweet Hannah.

594
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,790
Why is it focused on her lips?

595
00:30:31,796 --> 00:30:34,026
Because her eyes got poked out.

596
00:30:36,267 --> 00:30:39,566
She's beautiful and she was really great,
every single thing that she did.

597
00:30:39,637 --> 00:30:42,663
She's a real southern belle.

598
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:46,235
This scene was also a 30-minute one-take.

599
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:48,671
Wasn't it?

600
00:30:48,746 --> 00:30:50,338
Strangers kill other strangers.

601
00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:54,008
- Strangers also blow other strangers.
- Strangers also blow other strangers.

602
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:56,679
We've watched the trailer too many times.

603
00:30:56,754 --> 00:30:58,483
Guys, the trailer rules.

604
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:01,920
Is that an Xbox behind us?

605
00:31:01,993 --> 00:31:06,862
No, those are all cameras.
That's all camera stuff 'cause it's my room.

606
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:16,029
You guys seem to have
a real rapport with each other.

607
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:19,501
How long did you know each other
before the movie?

608
00:31:19,577 --> 00:31:22,876
- Zero days.
- We knew each other for a whole year.

609
00:31:23,114 --> 00:31:25,207
- What happened was we both got cast...
- Before we started filming?

610
00:31:25,283 --> 00:31:26,307
- Yeah, before we started filming.
- Okay.

611
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:31,845
We both got cast
way before the movie got started.

612
00:31:31,923 --> 00:31:34,983
- I got cast May 1st.
- There were changing studio problems.

613
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:38,859
I got February,
the day before Valentine's Day.

614
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:41,899
We met. We had shabu-shabu together.

615
00:31:41,966 --> 00:31:44,594
- That's right, the night before the audition.
- Just me, Zack, and my dad.

616
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:46,102
Yeah, we talked about Weezer.

617
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:48,570
And the next day we both got the part,
and we were shooting a teaser.

618
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,902
And the next day he shaved my balls.

619
00:31:49,974 --> 00:31:51,407
Yeah.

620
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,003
So, shabu-shabu, Weezer, shaving my balls.

621
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:57,047
And then what happened during that year
where you guys were waiting for the movie?

622
00:31:57,115 --> 00:31:59,606
We talked on the phone almost every day.

623
00:31:59,684 --> 00:32:01,049
- He was in Ann Arbor, Michigan.
- Literally.

624
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:03,178
I was on Long Island, New York.

625
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:05,449
You should see my phone bill.

626
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:07,651
It was ridiculous.

627
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:13,990
Dr. Genoa is Andrew Gurland,
just to put it out there.

628
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:17,200
- So, just saying it fast.
- The voice of the doctor is Andrew.

629
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:18,929
Yeah, that's Andrew Gurland.

630
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:22,765
Matt and I hung out. I went to New York,

631
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,671
- and Matt came to Ann Arbor.
- I went to Michigan.

632
00:32:24,742 --> 00:32:27,267
We hung out, practiced.

633
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,306
I'm not gonna specify what we practiced,

634
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,314
- but we practiced.
- Man.

635
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:32,849
That's Brent Caballero,

636
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:35,283
our casting director in New Orleans.

637
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:37,913
Can we say who this blurry faced guy is?

638
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:39,752
- Yeah, it's Chris Henchy.
- That's Chris Henchy.

639
00:32:39,824 --> 00:32:42,315
Chris Henchy, producer from Gary Sanchez.

640
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:48,198
You can see some terrible sunburn
on my nose there.

641
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:50,029
God, use some zinc.

642
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:52,163
Cover up, 45!

643
00:32:54,172 --> 00:32:56,766
If you can't find 45, use house paint.

644
00:33:00,244 --> 00:33:02,906
- Zack used to wear pajamas on the beach.
- Now, Matt,

645
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,676
how old were you
when you were shooting the movie?

646
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:08,207
- Seventeen.
- And was any of the sexual stuff

647
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:09,651
uncomfortable for you at all?

648
00:33:09,954 --> 00:33:12,889
Actually, I was very surprised
how comfortable I got.

649
00:33:13,424 --> 00:33:15,483
It was extremely surprising.

650
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:19,092
When we did the Becca loft scene,
I was just in underwear the entire time.

651
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:21,358
And in between takes, they're like,
"You want a robe?" I said, "No."

652
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:23,491
And I started walking around the streets
of New Orleans

653
00:33:23,568 --> 00:33:26,401
at 1:00 or 2:00 in the morning
just in my underwear.

654
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,363
That sounds like
you were really uncomfortable.

655
00:33:30,475 --> 00:33:32,136
I just came, okay?

656
00:33:32,577 --> 00:33:34,977
Thanks, you guys, it has been fun.

657
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:36,635
I'm out of here.

658
00:33:36,714 --> 00:33:40,172
Zack, I'm calling your mother.
I'm leaving the family.

659
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:41,240
It's up to you, pal.

660
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:43,118
My dad just left.

661
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:45,417
No, but was there a scene
for either one of you

662
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:48,823
where you guys were nervous
about it coming up?

663
00:33:48,893 --> 00:33:52,090
"I don't know how I'm gonna do this."

664
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:55,189
No, because I shaved Matt's balls
a year earlier.

665
00:33:55,266 --> 00:33:58,201
I was like, "Back to this!"

666
00:33:58,269 --> 00:34:02,137
I don't know.
I was so excited the whole time,

667
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:04,697
I let everything go.

668
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:09,213
I was nervous with the jump...

669
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:13,046
It didn't make it in, but we jumped
from the top of the house into the pool.

670
00:34:13,317 --> 00:34:14,807
That scared me a little bit.

671
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,376
- Yeah, yeah.
- But I did it.

672
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:17,546
- Dude.
- That was awesome.

673
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:18,884
Matt.

674
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:21,149
This guy was so professional the entire time.

675
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:22,317
Yeah, that guy was great.

676
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,224
- Never broke character.
- Best joke.

677
00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:26,821
- "$1,700!"
- Yeah, that's good.

678
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:29,690
I'm such a dummy.

679
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:32,235
- There's Matt wearing a Graf Orlock shirt.
- I love Graf Orlock.

680
00:34:32,303 --> 00:34:36,103
Graf Orlock is this awesome
hardcore punk band from California.

681
00:34:36,607 --> 00:34:39,667
And I told them, "You guys,
I'm wearing your T-shirt in the movie."

682
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,735
They were like, "Yeah, right,"
and I was like, "Yeah, totally."

683
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:44,873
- And totally made it in.
- And then seven people saw the movie.

684
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:46,473
Seven people saw it.

685
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:48,917
Seven whole people. Well, seven and a half.

686
00:34:48,986 --> 00:34:52,080
All of those shoes,
those are all Owen Burke shoes.

687
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,885
If you don't know who Owen Burke is...

688
00:34:57,829 --> 00:34:59,194
- That sucks for you, I guess.
- Owen Burke?

689
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:00,662
That's Owen Burke right there.

690
00:35:00,731 --> 00:35:02,790
Owen Burke is the predator
on the Graf Orlock shirt.

691
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:04,892
- It's not like you don't have the money.
- I don't have the money.

692
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:08,564
You have a college fund
that's overflowing with money.

693
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:12,441
Your mom would want you to do this.

694
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:18,105
<i>Matt, this is your last tape...</i>

695
00:35:18,182 --> 00:35:20,616
- That's not my mom.
- That's Jacob Davich.

696
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:22,516
<i>I've put away a little money for you.</i>

697
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:27,018
<i>I hope it will help with college</i>
<i>and make your life just a little easier.</i>

698
00:35:27,091 --> 00:35:28,888
I remember this bank.

699
00:35:28,993 --> 00:35:31,018
Nothing cool happened there.

700
00:35:33,731 --> 00:35:35,062
Except for that dance.

701
00:35:36,033 --> 00:35:39,196
That was the most fun they've had
in a long time.

702
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:43,137
And now, Huck, this looks old, that footage.
How did we get that?

703
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:46,574
Well, we <i>Trash-Humped</i> it. We did the thing

704
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:48,305
that Harmony Korine did on <i>Trash Humpers,</i>

705
00:35:48,379 --> 00:35:51,542
which was we put it through a VHS machine
over and over and over and over again.

706
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:54,517
- Wow.
- Finally it got older and older-looking.

707
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:58,015
I'm so excited.
I just downloaded <i>Trash Humpers.</i>

708
00:35:58,089 --> 00:35:59,181
I'm really not kidding.

709
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:00,724
- I believe you.
- I'm gonna watch that when I get home.

710
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:04,420
I've got so many VHS tapes.
I just don't know what to do with them.

711
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:08,124
I don't wanna get rid of them.
'Cause I don't believe in DVD.

712
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:16,132
My dad is using Netscape.

713
00:36:16,207 --> 00:36:17,834
- Oh, gosh!
- Netscape. Net.

714
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:19,399
It works the best on Web TV.

715
00:36:21,812 --> 00:36:23,746
Zack's dad at netscape. Net.

716
00:36:23,814 --> 00:36:27,341
My dad uses Altavista
to search for his favorite things.

717
00:36:27,552 --> 00:36:30,817
I wanna know
who this Jeeves is that everyone asks.

718
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:34,383
- Let's go.
- Well, I'll confront him...

719
00:36:35,092 --> 00:36:37,652
- Krysta.
- Funny thing about that monkey.

720
00:36:37,728 --> 00:36:39,063
That monkey was in our house
the whole time, right behind Krysta.

721
00:36:39,063 --> 00:36:41,964
That monkey was in our house
the whole time, right behind Krysta.

722
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:46,126
- It's a funny thing about that monkey.
- That's really funny.

723
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:48,399
- Hilarious, Zack, once again.
- You can hear us yell, "Cookout!"

724
00:36:48,472 --> 00:36:50,702
That was Justin's original name.

725
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:53,573
We changed it, for the movie, to Justin.

726
00:36:53,644 --> 00:36:57,102
Now, Justin's wardrobe in the movie
is pretty unique.

727
00:36:57,748 --> 00:36:59,841
Can you talk a little bit about
where that came from?

728
00:36:59,917 --> 00:37:01,145
Why don't you talk about it,
Andrew Gurland?

729
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:04,313
- The back of his car?
- You seem to know a lot about it.

730
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:08,848
Well, all the clothes that Justin wears
in the movie are his own clothes.

731
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:14,323
That is his unique fashion style sense
that you're seeing.

732
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:16,263
Andrew has a crush on Justin.

733
00:37:16,334 --> 00:37:19,497
I'm a big fan. My favorite of Justin's songs

734
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:22,698
is <i>Tyler Nelson (Please Don't Date Dannika).</i>

735
00:37:22,773 --> 00:37:23,865
- I love that song.
- That's a great song.

736
00:37:23,941 --> 00:37:25,636
- That kills me.
- I bet everybody on Nickelodeon

737
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,337
knows that song 'cause I kept singing it.

738
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:31,541
It's so good, right?
And I also like <i>I'll Never Be Your Boy Scout.</i>

739
00:37:31,882 --> 00:37:33,611
- I really enjoy that one, as well.
- Yeah, that one's good.

740
00:37:33,684 --> 00:37:36,585
Matt, you were very upset after
that watermelon went on your head,

741
00:37:36,654 --> 00:37:37,712
- I remember.
- I hated it.

742
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:39,380
I don't like being messy.

743
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:43,325
- You got very pouty after you got...
- Those are Matt's shoes on the dashboard.

744
00:37:43,394 --> 00:37:45,954
What I would say about Matt
is that he is anal

745
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:49,056
in the most classic sense of the word.

746
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:52,393
I just don't like to be messy,
and I don't like having fun.

747
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:55,531
Everyone is actually miserable in this shot.

748
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:58,234
And then this part right here...

749
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:00,037
That's CGI.

750
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:02,341
- CGI.
- That's me, by the way.

751
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:03,903
That's my dad.

752
00:38:06,384 --> 00:38:08,614
God, I wish Justin was my son.

753
00:38:11,722 --> 00:38:16,159
You know, this sequence
was originally scripted as a commune.

754
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:19,619
And it was gonna be a farm,
and hippies on it.

755
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:24,260
But we just saw this location one day,
and we changed it.

756
00:38:24,568 --> 00:38:27,401
Also, there are no hippies in New Orleans.

757
00:38:29,006 --> 00:38:31,634
- Only Slim Goodies.
- Only Slim Goodies.

758
00:38:32,943 --> 00:38:35,969
<i>- Courage.</i>
- I love the name of the boat.

759
00:38:36,047 --> 00:38:37,708
- Yeah.
- Actually, I haven't seen this part yet.

760
00:38:37,782 --> 00:38:39,215
So everybody be quiet, please.

761
00:38:39,283 --> 00:38:42,275
In the script, it was not a boat.
Is that right, Huck?

762
00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:46,312
- It was a horse?
- I do believe that it was a boat.

763
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:47,550
- It was not a boat.
- It was a tractor.

764
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:48,819
It was a tractor.

765
00:38:48,893 --> 00:38:50,360
- Yeah.
- Right?

766
00:38:50,428 --> 00:38:53,226
- I believe it was a tractor-boat.
- I feel like I just ruined that question

767
00:38:53,297 --> 00:38:54,628
that was for Huck.

768
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:59,265
I'm just trying to get Huck more involved,
that's all.

769
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:02,703
Okay, everybody stay quiet until Huck starts.

770
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:04,263
It feels awkward.

771
00:39:05,242 --> 00:39:08,143
I don't know if you know this or not,
but your dad is a little bitch.

772
00:39:08,212 --> 00:39:10,077
You know, Huck,

773
00:39:11,048 --> 00:39:14,176
when things get tight and uptight
around the Pearlman household,

774
00:39:14,251 --> 00:39:18,278
we all just take off our clothes,
and just sit free for a while.

775
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:20,324
- Dad, shut up.
- Yeah, I'm gonna take off my pants.

776
00:39:20,391 --> 00:39:21,449
Oh, God!

777
00:39:21,892 --> 00:39:22,916
There it is.

778
00:39:22,993 --> 00:39:25,621
- That's it.
- Here's something interesting about Huck

779
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,755
that everyone might not know.

780
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:32,394
Everything disgusting in the movie,
that's Huck's idea.

781
00:39:32,636 --> 00:39:36,470
Well, more of the bathroom humor.
Huck loves the bathroom.

782
00:39:36,807 --> 00:39:37,899
- Just love it.
- Yeah.

783
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:40,068
He did a series
of really awesome short films.

784
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:41,736
Originally, this chicken
was supposed to poop,

785
00:39:41,812 --> 00:39:44,713
but we couldn't make it.
But that was Huck's idea.

786
00:39:44,782 --> 00:39:47,774
He did a couple of really great films.

787
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:51,514
The dessert trilogy or quadrilogy?
How many? Talk about it.

788
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:54,256
The Dessertumentaries,
there are four of them.

789
00:39:54,325 --> 00:39:56,316
What do you think about them?

790
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:57,861
Have you seen all of them?
Did you watch all of them?

791
00:39:57,928 --> 00:39:59,054
I've actually watched all of them.

792
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:03,794
And basically what he does is,
he does terrible things to his family's food.

793
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:08,429
They're revenge movies, where I taint
some food that I give to my family.

794
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:11,202
- We had to shoot this boat scene 230 times.
- And we mean "taint"

795
00:40:11,275 --> 00:40:13,266
- in the most classic sense of the word.
- This made it in?

796
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:16,780
I've always missed this part.
I haven't seen this yet.

797
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:21,445
Now, Huck, do you remember shooting
this thing with the boat at all?

798
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:23,214
- Were you there that day?
- Yeah, it was amazing

799
00:40:23,287 --> 00:40:25,721
how we got it to just flip over like this.

800
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:29,851
I was really pleased with the shoot that day.

801
00:40:30,027 --> 00:40:33,895
They put a stick of dynamite under it
and it set it off, blew it up.

802
00:40:33,964 --> 00:40:37,900
No, for real, the boat did not do anything
but just kind of go straight up

803
00:40:37,968 --> 00:40:42,496
to the shore, but we were able
to fix that in post-production.

804
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:43,800
Is that right, Huck?

805
00:40:43,874 --> 00:40:44,208
- Yes, I recall something like that happening.
- Who did that?

806
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:46,438
- Yes, I recall something like that happening.
- Who did that?

807
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:48,410
Who did we do that with?

808
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:53,745
I don't remember his name.
Joe? Joe Bolero?

809
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:55,745
- That's pretty good.
- I love this scene.

810
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,879
- Sounds about right.
- So, what is it, a cartoon?

811
00:40:58,155 --> 00:41:00,214
- The boat?
- Kind of. Yeah.

812
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,486
- It's like a cartoon.
- Yes, Mr. Pearlman.

813
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,790
So, this is like <i>Cool World.</i>
This is like that movie <i>Cool World,</i>

814
00:41:04,862 --> 00:41:07,023
where it's cartoon and live-action.

815
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:10,260
- Yeah, like <i>Howard the Duck.</i>
- Yes, yes, yes.

816
00:41:10,334 --> 00:41:11,699
<i>Who Framed Roger Rabbit.</i>

817
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:13,999
<i>- Roger Rabbit.</i>
- Never saw that.

818
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:15,569
Guys, I don't smoke cigarettes.

819
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:17,368
- These are not real cigarettes, I don't think.
- That's CGI.

820
00:41:17,441 --> 00:41:18,430
- Really?
- Oh, my God.

821
00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:20,306
- No, they were Herbalettes.
- Herbalettes?

822
00:41:20,377 --> 00:41:23,835
This is a song that I wrote.
It's called <i>Need You to Know.</i>

823
00:41:23,914 --> 00:41:29,284
And I wrote it when I was in eighth grade
and we used it. That's it.

824
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:43,156
And is this the only song of yours
that made it into the movie?

825
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:45,259
Oh, God, no. There's too many.

826
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:49,466
Zack and I did <i>Birthday/Hurt Day.</i>
That was an improv song.

827
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:50,871
<i>Oh, Nicole.</i>

828
00:41:51,408 --> 00:41:54,434
I'm trying to think about all the other ones.
I think that's it.

829
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:56,002
Probably more.

830
00:41:58,749 --> 00:42:00,717
Do you write for Keesha?

831
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:03,680
That Keesha, that singer?

832
00:42:03,754 --> 00:42:06,552
- I think it's Kesha.
- Kesha?

833
00:42:06,624 --> 00:42:09,320
Matt and I recently smelled Kesha...

834
00:42:10,661 --> 00:42:13,425
- No comment.
- From across the room.

835
00:42:15,232 --> 00:42:17,598
So, Zack, did you have any drinks
on the night of this shoot?

836
00:42:17,668 --> 00:42:19,363
- No, I did not.
- Because you play it drunk.

837
00:42:19,436 --> 00:42:22,132
- It's so good...
- Well, thank you.

838
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:24,731
...that people think
that you are actually drunk.

839
00:42:24,808 --> 00:42:25,900
There is actually Oscar buzz

840
00:42:25,976 --> 00:42:28,444
- over this exact scene.
- Just this scene.

841
00:42:28,512 --> 00:42:30,036
- Just the scene.
- Supporting role.

842
00:42:30,114 --> 00:42:31,604
I am not drunk.

843
00:42:32,783 --> 00:42:34,876
But I've seen people drunk.

844
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:37,143
Zack's never drank before.

845
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:40,088
- I've never drank in my life.
- No, never.

846
00:42:41,525 --> 00:42:46,895
This is a little shout-out
to drunk people everywhere.

847
00:42:47,798 --> 00:42:49,993
- Now that also...
- That is the best outfit.

848
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:51,500
That is Justin's shirt.

849
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:52,627
Justin found that...

850
00:42:52,703 --> 00:42:54,500
- It was Buffalo Exchange.
- At a Buffalo Exchange.

851
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,665
- That was awesome.
- It was amazing.

852
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:59,732
Now, some people think
you were really sleeping there.

853
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:01,641
Were you really sleeping?

854
00:43:01,712 --> 00:43:05,045
- I wanted to be. I was tired.
- He was slipping. He was slipping.

855
00:43:06,383 --> 00:43:10,649
I really am fat in that scene. I actually am fat.

856
00:43:10,721 --> 00:43:12,313
You're adorable.

857
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,080
You can tell when Zack's sleeping,

858
00:43:14,158 --> 00:43:16,752
because he does this little thing
with his lips.

859
00:43:16,827 --> 00:43:18,727
A little thing, like he's kissing angels.

860
00:43:18,796 --> 00:43:21,424
That's what we say. He kisses angels.

861
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:23,667
Such a little sweet boy.

862
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:28,795
He always has an erection
when he sleeps, too. Just a little tent.

863
00:43:30,374 --> 00:43:34,003
- That tent's being held up by my penis.
- Emphasis on little.

864
00:43:34,078 --> 00:43:35,477
Very little.

865
00:43:37,047 --> 00:43:40,915
What do you remember about this stuff,
being out in the swamp?

866
00:43:42,186 --> 00:43:44,950
I remember people were miserable.

867
00:43:45,389 --> 00:43:48,722
It was super hot. But I loved it.
I thought it was super fun.

868
00:43:49,393 --> 00:43:52,260
I remember there were a lot of fire ants
on the grass

869
00:43:52,329 --> 00:43:53,990
- that were devouring people.
- Krysta got eaten up.

870
00:43:54,064 --> 00:43:57,522
Krysta got bitten by ants,
and she got stung by a bee.

871
00:43:57,735 --> 00:43:59,134
It was a wasp.

872
00:43:59,203 --> 00:44:02,570
It was a wasp, yeah.
We all got bitten. We all got hurt.

873
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:06,201
I love this part
because I get to punch Matt in the head.

874
00:44:06,777 --> 00:44:09,473
- I love that shot.
- I love Matt's face.

875
00:44:09,546 --> 00:44:12,447
It's so weird.
Yeah, I punch Matt in the head

876
00:44:12,516 --> 00:44:15,144
in three, two, one...

877
00:44:18,122 --> 00:44:20,613
- I get you back, though. I slap your back.
- It's true.

878
00:44:20,724 --> 00:44:23,454
It's true. He hits me.
Although, there was one...

879
00:44:23,527 --> 00:44:26,018
- Adolf.
- Adolf Shitler.

880
00:44:28,565 --> 00:44:31,398
I think my favorite play on words
for <i>The Virginity Hit</i>

881
00:44:31,468 --> 00:44:33,163
was <i>The Virginity Shit.</i>

882
00:44:34,538 --> 00:44:37,701
- We get that way too much in the comments.
- Yeah.

883
00:44:37,808 --> 00:44:39,969
There's Zack Pearlman.

884
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:42,743
- Little baby Zack.
- Look at him sleep.

885
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,871
Guys, here's a little movie magic for you.

886
00:44:45,949 --> 00:44:49,248
Even though it looks like dawn,
the sun was setting.

887
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,214
Movies.

888
00:44:53,724 --> 00:44:58,252
And there'll be a lot more movie trivia
coming up in the commentary

889
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:00,527
right now.

890
00:45:00,764 --> 00:45:04,165
Matt Bennett's really hot
in that sleeping bag. Movies.

891
00:45:06,303 --> 00:45:09,295
Matt, why don't you give a little movie fact?

892
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:14,136
That's a foot next to my head.

893
00:45:15,345 --> 00:45:18,280
- That's not my sleeping bag.
- Movies.

894
00:45:18,515 --> 00:45:19,709
Movies.

895
00:45:20,818 --> 00:45:24,652
Now, at the end of this scene,
something happened to you, Matt.

896
00:45:26,123 --> 00:45:31,390
- Yeah. I pitched, "Rape, rape."
- That's not what I'm talking about.

897
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:33,089
I'm talking about
when you ran outside the door

898
00:45:33,163 --> 00:45:34,323
- after you stole the suit.
- Oh, my God.

899
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:38,801
Right. So I was yelling, "Rape!"
And some guy outside heard me.

900
00:45:39,103 --> 00:45:41,901
And as I was running out, this exact take...

901
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:47,233
The guy lets me go, and I'm running out,
and the guy stopped me and was holding me

902
00:45:47,311 --> 00:45:49,302
'cause he thought
that either I raped somebody

903
00:45:49,379 --> 00:45:51,176
or I was the victim of a rape.
He's trying to help me

904
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:53,045
- in some way.
- No, I think it was because you were

905
00:45:53,117 --> 00:45:54,880
- stealing a suit.
- Right.

906
00:45:55,786 --> 00:46:00,223
As I recall, you ran out of the store
with a suit.

907
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:04,522
The security guard followed you
and a Good Samaritan on the street outside,

908
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:08,497
which was just unsecured,
tackled you and brought you down.

909
00:46:08,565 --> 00:46:09,964
That's true.

910
00:46:11,735 --> 00:46:17,071
I love the walk-up
when you're screaming those obscenities.

911
00:46:17,141 --> 00:46:20,008
That's ADR, too, so, thank you.

912
00:46:20,577 --> 00:46:22,511
Yeah, so, right here someone grabbed you.

913
00:46:22,579 --> 00:46:24,103
- Yeah.
- Yeah. For those who don't know,

914
00:46:24,181 --> 00:46:27,048
ADR means
Additional Digital Recording, right?

915
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:29,449
- Think it's "dialogue."
- Shut up. Movies.

916
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:33,350
<i>Let's count the spots on a baby giraffe</i>

917
00:46:33,824 --> 00:46:35,416
<i>Let's start with one</i>

918
00:46:35,492 --> 00:46:38,655
<i>- One. One, two, three</i>
<i>- One, two, three, four, five</i>

919
00:46:38,729 --> 00:46:41,323
- I have the stupidest face.
- Do you still have it on your phone, Matt,

920
00:46:41,398 --> 00:46:43,457
- your ring, <i>Baby Giraffe?</i>
- I think I have. Yeah, I do.

921
00:46:43,534 --> 00:46:45,502
- Can you play it for us?
- No.

922
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:48,570
Are there any other original songs

923
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:51,699
that you have written
that we don't use in the movie?

924
00:46:52,543 --> 00:46:54,807
Yeah, there's a lot.

925
00:46:54,878 --> 00:46:58,507
I could rattle off a couple,
but I'm not Jacob Davich.

926
00:46:58,582 --> 00:47:01,278
- Well, we'd love to hear a song right now.
- I love Jacob Davich.

927
00:47:01,351 --> 00:47:03,080
- Lf possible.
- Okay.

928
00:47:04,188 --> 00:47:06,156
It's acapella, let me start.

929
00:47:07,891 --> 00:47:09,518
Jack Black, everybody. Jack Black.

930
00:47:09,593 --> 00:47:11,584
<i>Trying to get my voice</i>

931
00:47:13,197 --> 00:47:17,258
<i>Think you're swell</i>
<i>Think you're swell</i>

932
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:19,969
Do you guys wanna call someone?

933
00:47:20,037 --> 00:47:22,164
- For what?
- I don't know. Call someone in the movie

934
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:24,366
- who isn't here.
- Yeah, let's call Nicole up.

935
00:47:24,441 --> 00:47:26,636
- Give Nicole a call.
- I'm gonna call Krysta.

936
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:28,735
In the meantime,
I'll sing a song that I wrote for Zack.

937
00:47:28,812 --> 00:47:31,406
Renner was not scripted.

938
00:47:31,949 --> 00:47:33,382
I didn't read the script.

939
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:42,457
Matt was just as lost as Justin and Jacob,

940
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:44,653
- for he did not read the script.
- Yes.

941
00:47:44,728 --> 00:47:47,891
No, but that's true. A lot of the folks
in the movie had not read the script

942
00:47:47,965 --> 00:47:49,330
and they just showed up.

943
00:47:49,399 --> 00:47:51,731
I think, one day I came to Andrew
and I was like, "I lost my script."

944
00:47:51,802 --> 00:47:53,429
And he's like,
"Well, what does that have to do..."

945
00:47:53,503 --> 00:47:55,300
And I was like,
"I don't know what I'm doing."

946
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:57,567
And I asked for one and I never got one.

947
00:47:57,641 --> 00:48:00,235
- So I don't think I ever read the script.
- I get it. It's my fault.

948
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:02,904
- It was totally your fault.
- I get it.

949
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:06,341
That woman is
an Academy Award-winning actress.

950
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:08,784
She's the third Gyllenhaal.

951
00:48:12,956 --> 00:48:16,255
- This is a great ADR.
- I'm calling Nicole right now.

952
00:48:17,094 --> 00:48:18,322
Oh, no. No, I'm not.

953
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:22,121
- I'm gonna try and call Krysta Rodriguez.
- Is it a good idea?

954
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:23,223
- Sure.
- Okay.

955
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:24,528
Call TGI Friday's.

956
00:48:25,369 --> 00:48:27,633
She's probably working. It's 5:00.

957
00:48:27,704 --> 00:48:29,331
- Cool.
- I know her schedule.

958
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:31,567
I don't think she works on Thursdays.

959
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:34,110
Okay, that's weird.

960
00:48:34,177 --> 00:48:35,644
Yeah, weirdo.

961
00:48:36,947 --> 00:48:39,575
Or you care about her.
And that's how you know.

962
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:42,551
- All right, I'm calling Krysta.
- I'm calling Nicole.

963
00:48:42,886 --> 00:48:44,979
<i>Hey, it's Krysta, leave a message.</i>

964
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:49,356
- That didn't work.
- I'm calling Nicole.

965
00:48:50,894 --> 00:48:53,692
America's darling, Nicole Weaver, everyone.

966
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:57,427
Guys, we are about to talk to the next
Shirley Temple, Nicole Weaver.

967
00:49:08,712 --> 00:49:10,145
High-five.

968
00:49:10,213 --> 00:49:12,010
- Bam Margera kickflip.
<i>- Hi, this is Nicole. Leave a message</i>

969
00:49:12,082 --> 00:49:13,242
<i>and I'll call you back.</i>

970
00:49:13,317 --> 00:49:15,342
I'm gonna call Justin Kline, guys.

971
00:49:15,419 --> 00:49:18,445
- That's a better idea.
- The old J. Kline.

972
00:49:19,756 --> 00:49:22,725
What if no one picks up
and this is just a failed experiment?

973
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:24,522
It's gonna turn her on.

974
00:49:26,263 --> 00:49:27,696
Love that. Great joke.

975
00:49:27,764 --> 00:49:31,495
Can I ask the filmmakers,
what did you see in my son, Zack,

976
00:49:32,169 --> 00:49:38,267
that made you wanna cast him in this role?
I mean, what did you see?

977
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:40,007
"Slightly."

978
00:49:40,877 --> 00:49:47,214
You know, the thing is that Zack auditioned
through <i>Funny or Die</i>

979
00:49:47,284 --> 00:49:48,945
by telling an embarrassing story.

980
00:49:49,353 --> 00:49:50,411
Is that true, Zack?

981
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:51,886
- You told us an embarrassing story...
- Yeah.

982
00:49:51,955 --> 00:49:54,150
...about something that happened to you
in your own life. What was that story?

983
00:49:54,391 --> 00:49:57,053
My sister walked in on me masturbating
when I was 16.

984
00:49:57,127 --> 00:49:58,617
God, sweet Hannah!

985
00:49:58,695 --> 00:50:00,925
- Sweet Hannah!
- No, no, Allie, the older one.

986
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:01,987
Okay.

987
00:50:05,569 --> 00:50:12,441
And what happened from there was
I convinced Allie to be in the video

988
00:50:13,043 --> 00:50:14,874
under false pretenses.

989
00:50:15,412 --> 00:50:18,904
And so when I told the story,
she had repressed the memory,

990
00:50:18,982 --> 00:50:21,746
- and it came out...
- This was the first day of filming.

991
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:24,881
Came out in a bad way.

992
00:50:24,955 --> 00:50:28,152
She had Vietnam flashbacks,
that's basically what happened.

993
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:32,722
Yeah, this was also
before principal photography.

994
00:50:32,796 --> 00:50:34,024
This is day one.

995
00:50:34,097 --> 00:50:35,894
Was this day one of principal?

996
00:50:35,999 --> 00:50:38,160
Because Luke wasn't there yet.

997
00:50:38,235 --> 00:50:41,500
- I think it was the exact same day as the...
- The Kenner stuff.

998
00:50:41,571 --> 00:50:43,801
- Yeah.
- That bat stuff, yeah.

999
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:45,842
That's Andrew Gurland's pubic hair.

1000
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:49,472
- This is a great story.
- The best gag.

1001
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:53,038
Is the teaser that we shot
gonna be on the DVD?

1002
00:50:53,116 --> 00:50:55,516
- Yeah, we think so.
- The first one we shot, I remember

1003
00:50:55,585 --> 00:50:59,646
we had just met.
We had all known each other for a little bit.

1004
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:02,317
I don't know if you know this, Andrew,

1005
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:06,988
we kept telling you that it wasn't enough
when it was clearly enough.

1006
00:51:07,364 --> 00:51:10,492
He must've come back, like, four times.

1007
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:12,592
And we were just like,
"Tell him it's not enough."

1008
00:51:12,669 --> 00:51:14,569
"It's not enough."
And we kept sending him back.

1009
00:51:14,638 --> 00:51:16,367
He probably cut off all of his pubic hair.

1010
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:21,343
- I'm very masculine in that area.
- Wearing black socks.

1011
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:23,345
I'm wearing nothing but socks.

1012
00:51:24,881 --> 00:51:28,476
I mean, it's pretty amazing.

1013
00:51:28,552 --> 00:51:30,952
Matt was like,
"I do not want to wear a thong.

1014
00:51:31,021 --> 00:51:34,889
"I don't wanna wear a slip.
I wanna show my penis to the world."

1015
00:51:35,725 --> 00:51:38,193
And we had to block it out.

1016
00:51:38,328 --> 00:51:38,962
Now, it didn't end up in the movie,
but you did actually deep-throat him.

1017
00:51:38,962 --> 00:51:41,931
Now, it didn't end up in the movie,
but you did actually deep-throat him.

1018
00:51:41,998 --> 00:51:43,488
- Yes.
- Oh, God!

1019
00:51:43,633 --> 00:51:44,930
Sweet Hannah!

1020
00:51:46,069 --> 00:51:50,472
And I remember that you had
these bruises on your ears

1021
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:54,032
- from where Matt was holding your head.
- My head, yeah.

1022
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:56,705
It was a bitch for continuity.

1023
00:51:56,780 --> 00:52:01,877
I just have to tell you that it was a funny bit,
but it just got cut from the movie,

1024
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:03,510
- because it wasn't as good...
- I still don't understand

1025
00:52:03,587 --> 00:52:06,385
why this is in an abandoned warehouse.

1026
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:08,117
- Well, apparently, so the key...
- Sinister.

1027
00:52:08,191 --> 00:52:10,751
And now it looks like we just go into a door.

1028
00:52:12,429 --> 00:52:15,125
So, Matt, you were underage
when we made this movie.

1029
00:52:15,198 --> 00:52:17,496
So there were a lot of rules and regulations
about what we had you do.

1030
00:52:17,567 --> 00:52:19,398
For example, when you did
get your pubic hair shaved,

1031
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:21,369
you actually were wearing a thong.

1032
00:52:21,438 --> 00:52:22,530
- I was wearing a thong.
- Right.

1033
00:52:22,606 --> 00:52:24,540
Then we digitally masked it out
so we couldn't see it,

1034
00:52:24,608 --> 00:52:25,905
and then we blurred it a little bit.

1035
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:31,414
And then, coming up, with the tranny doll,
we had very strident, stringent rules

1036
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:32,573
about what we could do,

1037
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:35,243
and one of the things that's not allowed
was that you were not allowed

1038
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:38,776
- to touch the doll.
- I could look at it. I could mention it.

1039
00:52:38,855 --> 00:52:40,413
I couldn't touch it.

1040
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:43,026
So that's the only thing.
I've done all my own stunts

1041
00:52:43,193 --> 00:52:44,683
- for everything I've ever done.
- Stunts?

1042
00:52:44,761 --> 00:52:46,752
Except for that.
I guess that counts as a stunt.

1043
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:48,354
I mean, they had a stunt double there.

1044
00:52:48,431 --> 00:52:50,991
- I've done all my own...
- When you say everything you've ever done,

1045
00:52:51,067 --> 00:52:53,558
- you mean during your entire catalogue?
- Yes.

1046
00:52:54,704 --> 00:52:58,435
He's always been on camera
when asked to be on camera.

1047
00:53:00,076 --> 00:53:02,601
This is a little tricky for everyone.

1048
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:05,375
One of the people thought
the movie was over.

1049
00:53:05,448 --> 00:53:08,110
- Really?
- I was at a screening,

1050
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:10,319
and someone was like, "That's it?"

1051
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:16,921
And they were expecting our credits,
and I was like, "This person's a real idiot."

1052
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:19,688
- But that would be funny.
- And that was actually your dad.

1053
00:53:19,796 --> 00:53:23,061
- And that was my dad.
- I know. I wanted to leave.

1054
00:53:23,466 --> 00:53:25,400
I want to go see <i>Guardians of Ga'Hoole.</i>

1055
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:29,631
Can I get to go see
<i>Guardians of Ga'Hoole</i> now?

1056
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:32,140
We should say, owl movie. The owl movie.

1057
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:35,610
Well, yeah, it's an owl movie.
<i>Guardians of Ga'Hoole!</i>

1058
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:38,341
- We're the Gyllenhaals.
- Guys, if you don't know,

1059
00:53:38,415 --> 00:53:41,179
that's one of the movies
we probably beat out this week.

1060
00:53:41,251 --> 00:53:45,984
- It was <i>Guardians of Ga'Hoole.</i>
- We're up against <i>Wall Street 2.</i>

1061
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:49,890
- Who wants to see Shia anymore?
- It doesn't stand a chance...

1062
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:51,120
And Michael Douglas?

1063
00:53:51,194 --> 00:53:52,855
- God, I love Michael Douglas.
<i>- Virginity Hit.</i>

1064
00:53:52,929 --> 00:53:54,260
Matt Bennett's balls.

1065
00:53:54,331 --> 00:53:56,356
Lot of people say
I look like Michael Douglas.

1066
00:53:56,466 --> 00:53:59,697
- Yeah, I could see that.
- Here's the problem. <i>Wall Street 2,</i>

1067
00:53:59,769 --> 00:54:03,034
they only made <i>2
so that they could make <i>Wall Street 3-D.</i>

1068
00:54:04,874 --> 00:54:06,501
The only reason they made <i>2.</i>

1069
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:08,874
The stocks really come out at you.

1070
00:54:10,447 --> 00:54:12,677
Talk about brokers.

1071
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:17,243
I hope <i>Wall Street 3
is like a teen sex-comedy.

1072
00:54:18,154 --> 00:54:21,885
- Direct to DVD, <i>Wall Street 3.</i>
- There was one

1073
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:26,927
improv here where I know that
she was asking what you wanna try.

1074
00:54:26,997 --> 00:54:28,828
And you said something.
Do you remember what that was?

1075
00:54:28,898 --> 00:54:32,766
I kept breaking character. I couldn't...

1076
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:36,402
Andrew, was it you? I think it was Owen.
Owen pitched the line.

1077
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:41,509
That I would say,
"I wanna try double penetration."

1078
00:54:42,879 --> 00:54:46,610
And actually I don't think Savannah knew
what double penetration was.

1079
00:54:46,716 --> 00:54:49,651
She did not know yet. No, she did not.

1080
00:54:49,719 --> 00:54:51,687
And we showed her.

1081
00:54:52,922 --> 00:54:55,049
Yeah, she knew before she wrapped.

1082
00:54:57,427 --> 00:55:00,419
This is funny. Matt asked me to be on set

1083
00:55:00,497 --> 00:55:02,397
for a little bit of this.

1084
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:05,866
And I did one thing,
and Andrew kicked me off.

1085
00:55:05,935 --> 00:55:08,563
I started singing,
and you were like, "Off now."

1086
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:09,900
'Cause I couldn't take it seriously,

1087
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:12,373
'cause Matt was walking around
in Superman underwear.

1088
00:55:12,442 --> 00:55:13,431
Yeah.

1089
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:16,377
- That was pretty serious stuff.
- This is that scene we were talking about

1090
00:55:16,446 --> 00:55:18,141
where I was in underwear all night.

1091
00:55:18,548 --> 00:55:20,607
We shot this until 5:00 in the morning.

1092
00:55:20,717 --> 00:55:23,982
I love this line coming up
about eating out a girl.

1093
00:55:27,023 --> 00:55:28,115
Right here.

1094
00:55:28,758 --> 00:55:31,090
I mean, I got really close.

1095
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:33,459
- It was, like, inches away from my face.
- Okay. Yeah.

1096
00:55:33,797 --> 00:55:38,632
Just you showing your hand to your face.

1097
00:55:38,702 --> 00:55:41,694
This is the most awkward movie.
So, yeah, I could look at it.

1098
00:55:41,771 --> 00:55:45,673
That's a penis on there. I could see it.
I could mention it, could not touch it.

1099
00:55:45,742 --> 00:55:48,472
And did you touch the doll at all
when we weren't rolling?

1100
00:55:48,545 --> 00:55:50,775
- Did you get to know it?
- No, I actually didn't.

1101
00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:51,939
- That would be not cool.
- He wasn't allowed.

1102
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:54,210
- I'm a law abiding citizen.
- That would be not cool.

1103
00:55:54,284 --> 00:55:56,309
That'd be considered child pornography.

1104
00:55:56,386 --> 00:56:00,015
But I do remember we were looking at dolls,

1105
00:56:00,090 --> 00:56:04,459
having fun picking out which doll,
and Matt was just cross-armed,

1106
00:56:04,994 --> 00:56:07,690
- couldn't participate.
- So that's as close as you got.

1107
00:56:07,764 --> 00:56:10,232
- Yeah.
- Right, and then we got a guy.

1108
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:11,824
- That's not me.
- This guy, Will Kennedy, right?

1109
00:56:11,901 --> 00:56:15,132
- Body double.
- Will "Thriller" Kennedy. That's not me.

1110
00:56:15,405 --> 00:56:18,033
- Will "Thriller."
- You can tell by the color of the underpants.

1111
00:56:18,108 --> 00:56:19,700
That's not me.

1112
00:56:19,776 --> 00:56:22,370
- And the thing is...
- I'm really not kidding. That's not me.

1113
00:56:22,445 --> 00:56:24,811
We cast Will from his headshot,
because he had the same...

1114
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:27,145
We took a picture of him.
He had the same body, same hair.

1115
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:29,515
He showed up,
he had no idea what he was gonna do.

1116
00:56:29,586 --> 00:56:32,953
- That's his first job, I think. Vagina Cam.
- His first job, and we said,

1117
00:56:33,022 --> 00:56:36,253
"You got to eat out this tranny doll."
He said, "Bring it on. Where is she?"

1118
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:40,290
- That's not me.
- He'd be a great member

1119
00:56:40,363 --> 00:56:41,853
of the Greatest Generation.

1120
00:56:43,099 --> 00:56:45,533
I've seen enough.
Can we please turn it off, now?

1121
00:56:45,602 --> 00:56:47,797
Wait. It gets worse.

1122
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:51,272
- I loved filming this scene coming up.
- Yeah.

1123
00:56:51,941 --> 00:56:53,670
Why is that, Zachary?

1124
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:56,175
'Cause we were all in a room.

1125
00:56:56,346 --> 00:57:00,578
Actually, it was the only time
none of the four were behind the camera.

1126
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:03,010
It was the first time
we could all be in the shot.

1127
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:04,485
- Blocked off.
- That's me.

1128
00:57:04,554 --> 00:57:06,454
One interesting thing
about the room that you're in

1129
00:57:06,523 --> 00:57:10,425
is Monique,
who built this loft from top to bottom,

1130
00:57:10,493 --> 00:57:12,256
- it was an empty loft warehouse.
- She did an amazing job.

1131
00:57:12,328 --> 00:57:14,592
She did an amazing job
building Becca's loft.

1132
00:57:14,664 --> 00:57:18,657
Then the room that you guys are in,
didn't have to do a thing to,

1133
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:21,794
because that house looked exactly like that
when we walked in.

1134
00:57:21,871 --> 00:57:24,965
With the Christmas tree thing, the surfboard.

1135
00:57:25,041 --> 00:57:27,976
We didn't have to do a thing to that house.
It's just this crazy, wacky house.

1136
00:57:28,044 --> 00:57:30,069
Yeah, this house ruled.

1137
00:57:30,146 --> 00:57:31,670
That house is amazing.

1138
00:57:34,751 --> 00:57:36,514
We got chocolate in that pool.

1139
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:38,915
There's chocolate in my pool.

1140
00:57:41,925 --> 00:57:44,450
Wait, what is that? When you say
that there's chocolate in your pool,

1141
00:57:44,527 --> 00:57:46,859
- what does that mean?
- There's a video on SUPERZACK

1142
00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:51,890
that we did where we rained chocolate syrup
over Nicole and her sister Jessica.

1143
00:57:52,502 --> 00:57:56,529
And they jump into the pool.
There's a reaction shot where I'm like...

1144
00:57:56,606 --> 00:57:58,801
- They don't jump in.
- My chocolate is full of pool.

1145
00:57:58,875 --> 00:58:00,536
There's pool in my chocolate.

1146
00:58:01,344 --> 00:58:03,812
- There's pool in my chocolate.
- I'm sorry.

1147
00:58:06,249 --> 00:58:08,683
So, what does that mean, the SUPERZACK?

1148
00:58:08,751 --> 00:58:12,653
SUPERZACK1000 is a YouTube account
that is supposed to be

1149
00:58:12,722 --> 00:58:15,156
Zack in the movie's YouTube account,

1150
00:58:15,225 --> 00:58:21,528
but you guys and, I guess, Sony,
gave me some freedom to upload some stuff.

1151
00:58:21,598 --> 00:58:25,193
And that's Matt actually punching me
in the back of the neck.

1152
00:58:25,301 --> 00:58:27,633
- A great place to punch someone.
- Fight back, Zack. Fight back.

1153
00:58:27,704 --> 00:58:30,468
Did you hit him as hard as you could, Matt?
Was that as hard as you could?

1154
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:33,509
One of them,
I remember Matt just clocking me

1155
00:58:33,576 --> 00:58:37,034
and I just saw double, 'cause he hit me
right in the back of the head.

1156
00:58:37,113 --> 00:58:39,377
There are a couple of times
where my notes were, "Be weaker."

1157
00:58:39,449 --> 00:58:41,184
Like, there's another scene
where we're jumping over a fence,

1158
00:58:41,417 --> 00:58:45,820
and I bounded it in the first shot.
"Matt, you have to struggle."

1159
00:58:45,889 --> 00:58:48,380
- I find that hard to believe.
- For the ladies.

1160
00:58:48,458 --> 00:58:50,119
You got to struggle for the ladies.

1161
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:52,991
You can't let him just sleep all day.

1162
00:58:53,062 --> 00:58:55,724
He won't show his face over there anymore.
Can you blame him?

1163
00:58:55,798 --> 00:58:58,130
Good Lord, what that girl did to him.

1164
00:58:58,201 --> 00:59:00,032
Well, you know,
the school year's almost over,

1165
00:59:00,103 --> 00:59:03,834
so maybe he can just get his GED.

1166
00:59:06,609 --> 00:59:09,942
<i>Male-Animal. Info</i> really exists.

1167
00:59:11,614 --> 00:59:13,343
Once we created it.

1168
00:59:13,616 --> 00:59:15,982
Yes. After we created it, sorry.

1169
00:59:16,619 --> 00:59:19,452
- Here we go, jack off.
- Oh, God.

1170
00:59:19,522 --> 00:59:21,387
Classic Zack Pearlman.

1171
00:59:22,792 --> 00:59:24,657
This is a great joke.

1172
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:28,793
Rain is CGI, I believe.

1173
00:59:28,865 --> 00:59:30,526
That's my 21st-birthday hat.

1174
00:59:32,835 --> 00:59:35,065
If you guys don't know what that's from,
that's from <i>The Rocketeer,</i>

1175
00:59:35,138 --> 00:59:41,008
which was a comic book
and then became a movie in 1992?

1176
00:59:41,077 --> 00:59:44,672
My first job in show business was

1177
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:48,183
I cut a TV spot for <i>The Rocketeer.</i>

1178
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:50,742
- What year was it?
- I just wanna point out, these girls,

1179
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:53,948
we licensed this footage.
They're actually watching "2 Girls 1 Cup,"

1180
00:59:54,023 --> 00:59:56,617
but we repurposed it
for "On your knees, Matt!!"

1181
00:59:56,693 --> 00:59:58,854
Who is this guy?
He looks like a huge Andrew Gurland.

1182
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:00,987
That's Norm Bar Stool.

1183
01:00:01,064 --> 01:00:03,464
Norm's Bar Stool, he's online.
You can find him.

1184
01:00:03,533 --> 01:00:05,797
- He's got great stuff. Yeah.
- He's fantastic.

1185
01:00:06,970 --> 01:00:08,597
- Dad, you know of him?
- Yeah.

1186
01:00:09,138 --> 01:00:11,732
Great recipes, great casserole recipes.

1187
01:00:13,476 --> 01:00:14,909
- Fantastic.
- Yeah.

1188
01:00:14,978 --> 01:00:19,108
Which I could say, Norm Bar Stool
looks like a fat Daniel Stern.

1189
01:00:21,718 --> 01:00:22,980
This is a great...

1190
01:00:25,088 --> 01:00:27,750
Dude, you look like a ninja
when you grab my arm.

1191
01:00:27,824 --> 01:00:29,621
Who's saying I'm not a ninja?

1192
01:00:30,026 --> 01:00:32,187
Listen, you got to be a ninja
when you're around

1193
01:00:32,261 --> 01:00:33,558
and there's cupcakes.

1194
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:36,690
- In Sweden, they call them ninyas.
- Ninyas.

1195
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:43,163
That's a call-out to my best friend,
Max Freiberg,

1196
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:46,104
who could be anywhere in the world
right now.

1197
01:00:46,175 --> 01:00:51,340
I love how in the script we had
Matt being a budding baker and chef,

1198
01:00:51,414 --> 01:00:54,281
and these muffins are such a freaking mess.

1199
01:00:54,350 --> 01:00:56,614
- I know.
- They weren't cupcakes. They were muffins.

1200
01:00:56,686 --> 01:00:59,211
- I love this.
- We were icing muffins.

1201
01:00:59,288 --> 01:01:01,381
There he is. Mr. Pearlman.

1202
01:01:02,592 --> 01:01:04,082
- Good job, sir.
- Thank you.

1203
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,495
That was awesome.

1204
01:01:06,763 --> 01:01:08,390
If only I could act like him.

1205
01:01:10,199 --> 01:01:12,258
- He's amazing.
- I love this scene. My sister's in this scene.

1206
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:14,599
- Allie Pearlman.
- Oh, Allie!

1207
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:20,605
Well, this is the sister scene,
because Nicole's sister is also in this.

1208
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:23,237
We like to call this the sister scene.

1209
01:01:23,312 --> 01:01:25,610
- That's Amanda on the left.
- Sipster scene.

1210
01:01:27,383 --> 01:01:28,611
What's her name? Keri?

1211
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:30,482
- Keri. That's Keri.
- That's Keri.

1212
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:34,614
- I think Holly's in this, too.
- This is me.

1213
01:01:35,792 --> 01:01:37,783
- Here she comes.
- And there's the sisters.

1214
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:39,259
- Boom, there's Allie.
- Oh, Allie!

1215
01:01:39,328 --> 01:01:42,126
That's Allie, and Jessica on the right,
and Nicole.

1216
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,661
And that's Nicole in the middle.

1217
01:01:45,735 --> 01:01:47,600
That's me in a big tiger...

1218
01:01:47,670 --> 01:01:50,468
That tiger suit came into play a lot more.

1219
01:01:53,276 --> 01:01:55,506
Allie told me she was taking her LSATs
that weekend.

1220
01:01:58,314 --> 01:02:00,373
- I was so proud of her.
- There was a joke here

1221
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:02,384
where, originally, we peed in the hat.

1222
01:02:02,985 --> 01:02:04,543
Sort of a YouTube-style prank.

1223
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:06,679
- We cut it out.
- What a classic joke.

1224
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:09,081
We should probably get that
onto SUPERZACK,

1225
01:02:09,158 --> 01:02:10,785
the peeing in the hat.

1226
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:15,960
You fucking cheated on Matt.

1227
01:02:16,766 --> 01:02:19,064
I know this is gonna sound weird,
but, Matt, do you remember we called

1228
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:22,127
- Paul Shearer on Owen's phone?
- Yeah, that was that night.

1229
01:02:22,705 --> 01:02:24,366
We called him up
and we said that we were big fans...

1230
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:29,139
Huge fans and I was asking him
if his life was really based off of

1231
01:02:29,212 --> 01:02:31,442
<i>- Pride and Prejudice.</i>
<i>- Pride and Prejudice.</i>

1232
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:34,781
- I think I said <i>War and Peace</i> after that.
<i>- War and Peace.</i>

1233
01:02:34,851 --> 01:02:36,443
"Is it true that your life
is based on <i>War and Peace?"</i>

1234
01:02:36,519 --> 01:02:38,578
I wanna name a kid Warren Peace.

1235
01:02:38,955 --> 01:02:41,423
- Warren.
- W-A-R-R-E-N?

1236
01:02:45,528 --> 01:02:49,396
- This is another original song.
- Let's just change the subject.

1237
01:02:49,465 --> 01:02:50,989
Zack always makes fun of me for that one.

1238
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:52,431
- Really?
- Yeah.

1239
01:02:53,002 --> 01:02:54,367
That clock is not on.

1240
01:02:55,538 --> 01:02:58,200
- That's a useless clock.
- That's Justin's...

1241
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:04,011
I remember Jacob had a raging boner
while watching this footage.

1242
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:10,283
I mean, Jacob had a huge boner
while watching this footage.

1243
01:03:10,386 --> 01:03:14,049
And my associate, Jacob, and I

1244
01:03:14,257 --> 01:03:16,487
have found a way to cure this problem.

1245
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:18,254
With all the bad shit...

1246
01:03:18,327 --> 01:03:21,296
Right.
And that's the Sunny Leone website, right?

1247
01:03:21,364 --> 01:03:23,696
- You need to leave.
- No. Hold on, wait a second.

1248
01:03:23,766 --> 01:03:25,529
- Yeah, right there.
- Leave.

1249
01:03:25,601 --> 01:03:27,432
- Oh, God. Dad, leave.
- Oh, God.

1250
01:03:27,537 --> 01:03:29,402
Hold on. We got Nicole on the phone.

1251
01:03:30,106 --> 01:03:32,506
- Dad, leave. Dad, leave. Nicole's here.
- Don't tell your mother.

1252
01:03:32,875 --> 01:03:35,867
- Hey, Nicole.
- I've got to put a pen in my butt.

1253
01:03:35,945 --> 01:03:39,073
- How are you?
<i>- I'm good. How are you?</i>

1254
01:03:39,448 --> 01:03:44,078
- We're watching Sunny Leone get doinked.
- We're watching the commentary

1255
01:03:44,153 --> 01:03:46,212
- of <i>The Virginity Hit.</i>
- No, we're watching <i>The Virginity Hit,</i>

1256
01:03:46,289 --> 01:03:48,587
- and doing the commentary.
- You talk to Zack.

1257
01:03:51,594 --> 01:03:52,754
Say it again.

1258
01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:57,588
<i>- I thought you were doing the commentary.</i>
- We are doing the commentary.

1259
01:03:58,601 --> 01:04:00,899
<i>- Hi, Zack.</i>
- Matt's going crazy.

1260
01:04:01,971 --> 01:04:04,667
Nicole, can you tell us
about your participation

1261
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:06,332
in <i>The Virgiminy Hit?</i>

1262
01:04:07,443 --> 01:04:08,967
Virgimininy Hit?

1263
01:04:10,146 --> 01:04:11,579
<i>The Virgiminy Christmas.</i>

1264
01:04:12,882 --> 01:04:14,474
<i>- What?</i>
<i>- The Virgiminy Hit.</i>

1265
01:04:21,724 --> 01:04:23,749
<i>I don't know how to explain.</i>

1266
01:04:24,594 --> 01:04:27,791
- You played Nicole in the movie.
<i>- I was the only girl</i>

1267
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:30,992
<i>besides Krysta.</i>
<i>She wasn't there the whole time.</i>

1268
01:04:31,067 --> 01:04:35,094
- Ask her where she is right now.
- Where are you right now, Nicole Weaver?

1269
01:04:36,105 --> 01:04:38,938
<i>- I'm in my kitchen.</i>
- Which is where in the world?

1270
01:04:40,109 --> 01:04:43,408
<i>- Flemington, New Jersey.</i>
- Ask her if she's with Twilight.

1271
01:04:43,512 --> 01:04:44,843
Are you with Twilight?

1272
01:04:45,414 --> 01:04:46,574
<i>Yes, I am.</i>

1273
01:04:47,383 --> 01:04:49,317
- Who's Twilight?
- Ask her.

1274
01:04:49,385 --> 01:04:50,875
- Who's Twilight?
<i>- That's my dog.</i>

1275
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:52,682
Your dog?

1276
01:04:53,256 --> 01:04:54,382
<i>My dog.</i>

1277
01:04:55,558 --> 01:04:56,684
No way.

1278
01:04:57,293 --> 01:04:59,158
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- That's really your dog's name?

1279
01:04:59,228 --> 01:05:01,696
I thought that was the name
of your boyfriend.

1280
01:05:01,797 --> 01:05:02,821
<i>What?</i>

1281
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:04,799
I thought that was
your boyfriend's name, Twilight.

1282
01:05:05,134 --> 01:05:07,261
- 'Cause he dresses like Edward.
- No, his name is Violent Jay.

1283
01:05:07,336 --> 01:05:08,894
<i>You're such a fucking dick.</i>

1284
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:12,774
Commentary rules.

1285
01:05:13,876 --> 01:05:15,867
Here's Matt. We miss you.

1286
01:05:21,017 --> 01:05:24,316
Nicole, I'm gonna hang up now,
but it was very nice talking to you.

1287
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:26,913
<i>It was super nice talking to you, too.</i>

1288
01:05:26,989 --> 01:05:29,389
- Okay. I love you, too.
<i>- Okay.</i>

1289
01:05:29,458 --> 01:05:30,720
- Okay.
<i>- What?</i>

1290
01:05:30,793 --> 01:05:32,454
No, I will not make out with you.

1291
01:05:32,528 --> 01:05:33,654
That was so warm.

1292
01:05:33,729 --> 01:05:38,223
Matt just said, "I love you, too,"
without being told he was loved.

1293
01:05:40,503 --> 01:05:42,767
- Love is funny like that.
- Owen Burke just walked in.

1294
01:05:43,139 --> 01:05:46,302
I've got a clearance sheet for Nicole.
Where is she?

1295
01:05:46,375 --> 01:05:49,503
- She's got to sign this.
- She's in Flemington, man.

1296
01:05:49,578 --> 01:05:51,409
Flemington? All right.

1297
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:54,005
I got to get on a JetBlue flight to Newark.

1298
01:05:54,183 --> 01:05:56,651
I don't know if you know this,

1299
01:05:56,719 --> 01:06:00,416
- but you sound a lot like Zack's dad.
- My dad.

1300
01:06:00,489 --> 01:06:01,547
Really?

1301
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:05,082
I've never met him.
I've only seen pictures of him on Craigslist.

1302
01:06:05,161 --> 01:06:08,153
- He just walked out.
- He did?

1303
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:09,288
You might have seen him in the hallway.

1304
01:06:09,365 --> 01:06:13,096
I saw a guy running around
with an erection and a pen up his butt.

1305
01:06:13,169 --> 01:06:14,500
- But I did not...
- That was my dad.

1306
01:06:14,570 --> 01:06:17,061
Oh, gosh, that's your... Oh, yeah!

1307
01:06:18,207 --> 01:06:20,767
That's great. Oh, man.
What is this, the movie?

1308
01:06:20,843 --> 01:06:22,333
Yeah.

1309
01:06:22,411 --> 01:06:25,539
- What are you guys doing, commentary?
- Commentary, Owen, yeah.

1310
01:06:25,614 --> 01:06:27,844
Owen Burke, everybody.
Owen Burke, producer,

1311
01:06:27,917 --> 01:06:30,385
who is with us every day pitching jokes,

1312
01:06:30,453 --> 01:06:34,184
and there's a ton of them in the movie.

1313
01:06:34,256 --> 01:06:35,814
Just keeping good morale
when we need to fire people.

1314
01:06:35,891 --> 01:06:39,224
And also a terrific friend,
I might add, as well.

1315
01:06:39,295 --> 01:06:42,594
It was really great to get to know all of you
so well, you know?

1316
01:06:43,099 --> 01:06:43,165
- It was a sweet time.
- I really value our friendship.

1317
01:06:43,165 --> 01:06:45,759
- It was a sweet time.
- I really value our friendship.

1318
01:06:45,835 --> 01:06:48,929
- I do, too. Well, we met so many years ago.
- Yes.

1319
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:53,604
But I only saw a little bit of you
through that hole.

1320
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:55,268
I only saw a little bit of you
through that hole.

1321
01:06:55,344 --> 01:06:57,835
Yeah, well, that's why they call it
a glory hole.

1322
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:01,881
It was glorious.

1323
01:07:01,951 --> 01:07:05,045
I believe one of the classic lines
from the movie is yours, Owen.

1324
01:07:05,121 --> 01:07:07,316
It's Hitchcock...

1325
01:07:07,390 --> 01:07:09,756
"I'm gonna do to your virginity
what Hitchcock did for <i>Birds. "

1326
01:07:09,825 --> 01:07:12,521
- That is Owen Burke, everybody.
- It's an OB.

1327
01:07:12,762 --> 01:07:14,957
- There were a lot of alternates.
- There was.

1328
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:17,256
It's all about choices
in the editing room, guys.

1329
01:07:17,333 --> 01:07:20,666
There was a Robert Zemeckis one,
which was,

1330
01:07:20,736 --> 01:07:24,672
"I'm gonna do for your virginity,
what Robert Zemeckis did

1331
01:07:25,007 --> 01:07:27,976
"for old men and young boys
with time travel."

1332
01:07:33,416 --> 01:07:35,441
Did I say, "Old boys and young men"?

1333
01:07:35,518 --> 01:07:40,319
I love how the more we've been drinking,
the less we've been talking about the movie

1334
01:07:40,389 --> 01:07:42,118
that's in front of us.

1335
01:07:42,191 --> 01:07:44,318
I've said, "Pool in my chocolate,"
too many times.

1336
01:07:44,393 --> 01:07:45,883
You notice that girl on that pole?
Not that pole.

1337
01:07:45,961 --> 01:07:48,452
- The girl on the pole to the right of us.
- Yeah.

1338
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:50,456
She was an extra.

1339
01:07:50,533 --> 01:07:52,933
- Oh, my God.
- She was an extra.

1340
01:07:53,302 --> 01:07:54,462
She's very beautiful.

1341
01:07:54,537 --> 01:07:56,801
This is actually by a band
called The Spyderz,

1342
01:07:57,873 --> 01:08:02,003
which has a member, a guy named Dirty,
or Daniel Weber,

1343
01:08:02,244 --> 01:08:04,678
who was dating Sunny at the time,
so they gave us clearance for it.

1344
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:06,180
- And still is.
- I thought they broke up.

1345
01:08:06,248 --> 01:08:07,875
- No, no, no. They're tight.
- Ooh la la.

1346
01:08:08,818 --> 01:08:10,718
- Wait, why would you say, "Ooh la la"?
- Wishful thinking.

1347
01:08:10,786 --> 01:08:13,254
- I don't know. Hubba-hubba.
- You know what? Never mind.

1348
01:08:14,023 --> 01:08:16,082
He meant "hubba-hubba"
when he said, "Ooh la la."

1349
01:08:16,158 --> 01:08:20,151
I wanna read some YouTube comments
on how excited people are for the movie.

1350
01:08:20,729 --> 01:08:22,594
- I think they're available.
- Lf I could.

1351
01:08:23,265 --> 01:08:25,665
- You wanna take a look in and see?
- Owen, can you tell us

1352
01:08:25,734 --> 01:08:30,068
how you pitched Sunny her pole dance set?

1353
01:08:30,673 --> 01:08:34,006
Well, Sunny and I worked
very closely choreographing the set.

1354
01:08:34,743 --> 01:08:36,802
I worked the pole for several years,

1355
01:08:36,879 --> 01:08:39,677
and Sunny, actually,
she's never really worked the pole.

1356
01:08:39,748 --> 01:08:43,206
So I showed her a couple of moves.
That's my outfit she's wearing.

1357
01:08:45,287 --> 01:08:47,084
- They have the same body type.
- Here you go, guys.

1358
01:08:47,156 --> 01:08:52,287
So I just wanna let you know the Internet
is abuzz for <i>The Virginity Hit.</i>

1359
01:08:52,661 --> 01:08:57,064
With comments like,
"Rich, privileged white kids.

1360
01:08:57,133 --> 01:08:58,794
"I hope this movie flops."

1361
01:09:01,237 --> 01:09:04,365
- Here's another one.
- That one was me. That was my account.

1362
01:09:10,312 --> 01:09:12,212
Jacob in a sailor suit.

1363
01:09:12,448 --> 01:09:15,747
Always a pleasure
to see Jacob in a sailor suit.

1364
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:17,786
Yeah, especially since he was in the Army.

1365
01:09:17,853 --> 01:09:19,218
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1366
01:09:19,288 --> 01:09:20,653
- That's a good one.
- One of my favorite jokes.

1367
01:09:20,723 --> 01:09:24,181
Here we go.
"250 people missed the dislike button."

1368
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:25,686
Nailed it.

1369
01:09:27,596 --> 01:09:29,860
And look, there you can see Zack
holding the camera.

1370
01:09:29,932 --> 01:09:32,127
Occasionally we gave Zack the camera.

1371
01:09:32,201 --> 01:09:34,897
And an awesome cameo.

1372
01:09:34,970 --> 01:09:36,767
That's Miss Amy Hobby.

1373
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:39,569
Amy Hobby is in the shot,
and her boyfriend, Joe McGinty,

1374
01:09:39,642 --> 01:09:41,473
is the composer of the song we just heard,

1375
01:09:41,544 --> 01:09:44,570
so it was the Hobby-McGinty moment
of the movie.

1376
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:47,314
- Amy Hobby is the producer on the movie.
- And I came.

1377
01:09:47,950 --> 01:09:51,943
Thank you, guys, again, for everything.
I'll come back later. Thank you, Miss Sunny.

1378
01:09:54,590 --> 01:09:57,616
- That was a line that I pitched.
- Great joke. Thank you for that.

1379
01:09:57,693 --> 01:09:59,456
- Very good.
- Here we go.

1380
01:10:00,729 --> 01:10:05,666
Anything that has to reference
Matt's TV show is my favorite.

1381
01:10:06,368 --> 01:10:09,804
"Isn't that the kid with the stupid hair
on Nickelodeon?"

1382
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:14,974
- But that's just his hair.
- "He can kiss his career goodbye."

1383
01:10:15,311 --> 01:10:18,940
Which everyone knows, starring in a movie
means your career is done.

1384
01:10:19,248 --> 01:10:19,315
Yeah, 'cause movies are terrible for careers.

1385
01:10:19,315 --> 01:10:21,374
Yeah, 'cause movies are terrible for careers.

1386
01:10:21,884 --> 01:10:23,909
"Nickelodeon is gonna fire that idiot."

1387
01:10:24,186 --> 01:10:26,882
"This looks gay." "This is retarded."

1388
01:10:27,957 --> 01:10:32,360
"This movie looks fucking..."
But spelled with two "K's." "...lame."

1389
01:10:33,362 --> 01:10:34,989
That's actually a compliment
when it's two "K's."

1390
01:10:35,064 --> 01:10:36,122
Yeah.

1391
01:10:38,801 --> 01:10:41,463
Hi. This is my boyfriend, Dirty.

1392
01:10:41,537 --> 01:10:44,438
"Flagged for being fucking retarded."

1393
01:10:45,474 --> 01:10:50,935
So, as the guys were saying,
Sunny and Daniel are together in real life,

1394
01:10:51,547 --> 01:10:55,244
and Sunny only does scenes with Daniel.

1395
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:58,280
- Well, unless they're girl-on-girl scenes.
- Right.

1396
01:10:58,354 --> 01:11:01,323
- Right, she only does girl-guy...
- Girl-guy with Daniel.

1397
01:11:03,892 --> 01:11:06,053
<i>Oh, Matty</i>

1398
01:11:06,128 --> 01:11:08,494
<i>Got fucked over by Nicole</i>

1399
01:11:12,668 --> 01:11:15,296
And what really drew us to the lyrics
was the complexity.

1400
01:11:15,371 --> 01:11:17,305
Yeah, I thought it was funny.

1401
01:11:17,906 --> 01:11:21,307
So many layers and meanings
and metaphors.

1402
01:11:21,377 --> 01:11:24,437
I like how people question
why you're in the movie.

1403
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:28,045
"That's the guy
from the Nickelodeon show, <i>Victorious.</i>

1404
01:11:28,150 --> 01:11:32,246
"Why the fuck is he in a rated-R movie,
when he's on a children's television show?"

1405
01:11:32,321 --> 01:11:35,017
And it beats me.
I don't know why I'm in a movie.

1406
01:11:35,090 --> 01:11:38,355
This bus was supposed to go
to some country star.

1407
01:11:38,427 --> 01:11:40,088
They were supposed to pick him up.

1408
01:11:40,162 --> 01:11:42,824
And we just left it a super mess.
I felt so bad.

1409
01:11:42,898 --> 01:11:45,128
- Really?
- They go pick up this country star.

1410
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:46,667
I think it was Keith Urban.

1411
01:11:46,735 --> 01:11:49,203
Yeah, yeah.

1412
01:11:49,271 --> 01:11:51,068
- I'm pretty sure it's Keith Urban.
- Or Faith Hill.

1413
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:54,268
- McGraw. It was McGraw.
- Gavin DeGraw.

1414
01:11:54,410 --> 01:11:56,970
- No. Not Gavin DeGraw.
- No. Sorry. Never mind.

1415
01:11:57,046 --> 01:11:58,809
- I'm retarded.
- Whoever.

1416
01:11:58,881 --> 01:11:59,905
Kav McGraw?

1417
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:01,279
Scruff McGruff?

1418
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:04,046
That whole purple thing Daniel's leaning
against was to cover a mirror.

1419
01:12:04,119 --> 01:12:07,316
We didn't want to show Luke, our DP,
in the shot.

1420
01:12:07,389 --> 01:12:09,084
- Luke Geissbuhler.
- Luke Geissbuhler, everybody.

1421
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:11,626
Luke Geissbuhler, our Double Penetration.

1422
01:12:12,061 --> 01:12:15,087
Luke Geissbuhler, he would be sweating
by the end of every day,

1423
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:18,691
'cause he was just constantly running.
Hardest working guy in the world.

1424
01:12:18,767 --> 01:12:20,325
Super hard-working guy.
He was also carrying

1425
01:12:20,402 --> 01:12:23,769
a giant, heavy camera all day long,
which none of us had to do.

1426
01:12:23,839 --> 01:12:28,333
He was the one guy with a giant camera
on his back the whole day.

1427
01:12:28,444 --> 01:12:31,174
And also,
one thing that I find interesting is that,

1428
01:12:31,246 --> 01:12:34,647
as a DP, your life is all about
making things look beautiful.

1429
01:12:35,117 --> 01:12:39,213
And for this movie,
we asked that he really make things

1430
01:12:39,288 --> 01:12:43,247
- not look beautiful.
- But he is a genius. He shot <i>Borat.</i>

1431
01:12:43,325 --> 01:12:45,589
Yeah, yeah. No. He is a genius.

1432
01:12:45,661 --> 01:12:48,061
He did. He was the DP for <i>Borat.</i>

1433
01:12:48,130 --> 01:12:50,564
It's just a different mindset for a DP

1434
01:12:50,632 --> 01:12:53,829
to say, "I'm going to dumb it down.
I'm gonna make it look grainy,

1435
01:12:53,902 --> 01:12:55,460
"or I'm gonna make it look worse."

1436
01:12:55,537 --> 01:12:58,802
You know, he employed, I think,
seven different cameras to shoot this movie.

1437
01:12:58,874 --> 01:13:04,540
But I think, in a way, because he spent
so much detail to attention...

1438
01:13:04,646 --> 01:13:06,841
- Attention to detail.
- Yeah, we get it.

1439
01:13:06,915 --> 01:13:09,349
- Guys.
- Another Greyhound, Zack?

1440
01:13:09,418 --> 01:13:11,249
- Greyhound.
- Greyhound, please.

1441
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:16,883
He spent so much attention to detail that
this is actually, I would assume, harder.

1442
01:13:17,326 --> 01:13:18,850
Because you have to make it look bad.

1443
01:13:18,927 --> 01:13:23,261
It's not any easier. It goes against instinct.
Yeah, for sure.

1444
01:13:23,332 --> 01:13:24,959
This is a great quote.

1445
01:13:25,033 --> 01:13:28,525
"LOL. Way to make kids feel pressured
into losing their virginity.

1446
01:13:28,604 --> 01:13:30,868
"Abortion clinics are having a parade."

1447
01:13:32,775 --> 01:13:34,766
They actually do throw great parades.

1448
01:13:35,644 --> 01:13:37,737
Have you seen their floats? They're amazing.

1449
01:13:37,813 --> 01:13:41,010
- Grand master.
- Really fantastic, yeah.

1450
01:13:41,650 --> 01:13:46,986
I saw this shit on ESPN2, where, like,
these little Asian kids stack cups.

1451
01:13:47,322 --> 01:13:50,416
What is the deal with that cup stacking?
It's a sport, right?

1452
01:13:50,492 --> 01:13:53,290
Yeah, it's a sport. It's a recognized sport.

1453
01:13:54,696 --> 01:13:59,929
I feel like masturbating should be
a recognized sport if cup stacking is.

1454
01:14:00,602 --> 01:14:01,660
Thank you very much, sir.

1455
01:14:02,037 --> 01:14:03,902
- Breasts.
- Breasts.

1456
01:14:07,142 --> 01:14:10,805
How did you like working with Sunny, Matt?
How were those scenes?

1457
01:14:10,879 --> 01:14:12,642
- They were actually really good.
- What happened back there

1458
01:14:12,714 --> 01:14:15,740
- when you guys were sitting back there?
- Sunny was very, very adamant.

1459
01:14:15,818 --> 01:14:20,380
"You're 17. You're not 18.
We can't do anything."

1460
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:22,754
So we just sat back there
and just looked at each other, basically.

1461
01:14:22,825 --> 01:14:24,759
She actually thought
maybe you were gonna try and like...

1462
01:14:24,827 --> 01:14:25,851
I wasn't gonna try anything.

1463
01:14:25,928 --> 01:14:27,725
- But that's what she thought.
- We were working. She's like,

1464
01:14:27,796 --> 01:14:29,559
"I'm not gonna touch him."
I don't know what it was,

1465
01:14:29,631 --> 01:14:32,191
but she kept making a big deal
that I was 17 when we filmed this.

1466
01:14:32,267 --> 01:14:34,861
- Right, yeah.
- Way to make me feel comfortable, Sunny.

1467
01:14:36,004 --> 01:14:39,440
I love her, though. She's very sweet.
And working with her was great.

1468
01:14:39,741 --> 01:14:42,403
She's very, very beautiful.

1469
01:14:43,712 --> 01:14:46,374
- She's very cool.
- That's how I like them, beautiful.

1470
01:14:47,416 --> 01:14:50,249
This is a great one. "I hated <i>Happy Feet,</i>

1471
01:14:50,352 --> 01:14:53,344
"but this movie will be
10 times worse than <i>Happy Feet. "

1472
01:14:59,761 --> 01:15:02,025
That was Lord Ramen X.

1473
01:15:02,097 --> 01:15:06,727
That guy definitely will enjoy
<i>Guardians Of Ga'Hoole</i> when that comes out.

1474
01:15:07,536 --> 01:15:09,367
I don't know. That guy sounds like
he doesn't like animals.

1475
01:15:09,438 --> 01:15:10,462
This is the fence.

1476
01:15:10,539 --> 01:15:11,699
Didn't you hurt yourself
going over the fence?

1477
01:15:11,773 --> 01:15:14,867
You were saying you need to be weaker,
but you actually injured yourself

1478
01:15:14,943 --> 01:15:16,376
going over the first time, did you not?

1479
01:15:16,445 --> 01:15:17,969
- No, I didn't.
- You didn't?

1480
01:15:18,046 --> 01:15:19,513
- Stop.
- It was acting?

1481
01:15:19,581 --> 01:15:21,640
- No, I acted hurt.
- Yeah, he hurt himself.

1482
01:15:23,352 --> 01:15:26,048
- It's okay, Matt. You can hurt yourself.
- "Fuck this movie and its promotion.

1483
01:15:26,121 --> 01:15:29,682
"Everyone who's involved with this movie
can die being butt-raped."

1484
01:15:30,592 --> 01:15:33,083
I think somebody has
actually died being butt-raped,

1485
01:15:33,161 --> 01:15:35,095
- who worked on this film.
- Yeah, it's not funny.

1486
01:15:35,163 --> 01:15:36,960
- The sound mixer was...
- RIP Jacob Davich.

1487
01:15:37,032 --> 01:15:39,227
- It was Tammy?
- No, not Tammy.

1488
01:15:39,301 --> 01:15:40,962
- No, no, that was...
- The boom op?

1489
01:15:41,036 --> 01:15:43,527
- After that, then we brought Tammy in.
- Yeah.

1490
01:15:43,939 --> 01:15:45,270
It was Bruce.

1491
01:15:45,707 --> 01:15:48,073
- Yeah, Bruce, and it was public, too.
- Yeah.

1492
01:15:48,143 --> 01:15:50,270
- It was right after...
- It was actually at Publix.

1493
01:15:51,580 --> 01:15:54,413
Guys, I think I just found
the Jewiest comment.

1494
01:15:54,483 --> 01:15:59,978
"Jew Boy <i>shtups</i> a sticka." Schika? Schikta?

1495
01:16:00,055 --> 01:16:02,046
- "Doesn't Hollywood have any..."
<i>- Shiksa? Shiksa?</i>

1496
01:16:02,124 --> 01:16:05,389
Yeah, <i>shiksa.</i>
So, it's, "Jew Boy <i>shtups</i> a <i>shiksa."</i>

1497
01:16:06,028 --> 01:16:07,620
<i>- Shtups-a.</i>
<i>- Shtups-a.</i>

1498
01:16:07,696 --> 01:16:09,823
"Doesn't Hollywood have any new plots?"

1499
01:16:13,101 --> 01:16:14,568
- Yeah, but you...
- I... I couldn't...

1500
01:16:14,636 --> 01:16:15,660
You never assume someone's at their house.

1501
01:16:15,737 --> 01:16:19,002
That thing in the back said "Jesus."
You can't see it. Never mind.

1502
01:16:19,074 --> 01:16:22,566
- I think we flipped it down.
- That means Satan.

1503
01:16:23,745 --> 01:16:27,044
This video, surprisingly,
has some pretty intelligent comments

1504
01:16:27,115 --> 01:16:30,380
followed by, "Okay, people,
you're taking this too seriously.

1505
01:16:30,452 --> 01:16:32,386
- "Calm the fuck down."
- Zack's terrified face.

1506
01:16:32,454 --> 01:16:34,479
He actually hurt me.
We did so many takes of this scene.

1507
01:16:34,556 --> 01:16:36,285
- Yeah.
- That's good.

1508
01:16:36,358 --> 01:16:40,385
I actually bit David.
He asked me to bite him, so I bit his arm.

1509
01:16:40,462 --> 01:16:45,957
It is pretty amazing how seriously people
will take this movie on comment boards,

1510
01:16:46,034 --> 01:16:52,564
and how our vibe on it
was to not take it too seriously.

1511
01:16:53,342 --> 01:16:55,401
- Another <i>Happy Feet</i> joke.
- No way.

1512
01:16:55,477 --> 01:16:58,071
- Why <i>Happy Feet?</i>
- "Fuck this shit. I'm watching <i>Happy Feet."</i>

1513
01:16:59,715 --> 01:17:02,513
I feel like, dude,

1514
01:17:02,584 --> 01:17:04,017
- some tards talked about it on the forum.
- Okay.

1515
01:17:04,086 --> 01:17:06,486
- Here's a great cameo.
- Everybody, cameo's coming up.

1516
01:17:06,555 --> 01:17:09,115
- My favorite cameo in the entire film.
- Look closely.

1517
01:17:09,191 --> 01:17:11,751
- Watch the pool.
- Lf you pause it right now,

1518
01:17:11,827 --> 01:17:13,818
- that's Owen Burke.
- Owen Burke.

1519
01:17:13,895 --> 01:17:15,055
In the white chair, Owen.

1520
01:17:16,732 --> 01:17:18,029
This is amazing.

1521
01:17:18,734 --> 01:17:20,065
Dude! Run, now!

1522
01:17:20,435 --> 01:17:21,937
This entire scene was actually...

1523
01:17:22,704 --> 01:17:26,333
David Jensen, his one request was
that we didn't wear shoes

1524
01:17:26,408 --> 01:17:28,205
- while running around.
- I don't remember that. Why?

1525
01:17:28,276 --> 01:17:29,334
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

1526
01:17:29,411 --> 01:17:31,936
'Cause he's a ninja or a ninya.

1527
01:17:32,581 --> 01:17:34,708
- And I think he wanted to look at your feet.
- Yeah.

1528
01:17:35,617 --> 01:17:36,606
Stop.

1529
01:17:39,287 --> 01:17:40,549
This was great.

1530
01:17:41,456 --> 01:17:43,321
Yeah, I had sex with that girl.

1531
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:46,387
Famous Jacob Davich quote.

1532
01:17:48,697 --> 01:17:51,222
So, is that true you guys were...
In the making of the movie,

1533
01:17:51,299 --> 01:17:52,425
there was a lot of sex happening,

1534
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:53,525
- is that right?
- Not for me.

1535
01:17:53,602 --> 01:17:54,762
Not for me.

1536
01:17:55,504 --> 01:17:56,766
Andrew?

1537
01:17:57,305 --> 01:17:59,535
- I'd say for Jacob Davich.
- I would say just regular for me.

1538
01:17:59,608 --> 01:18:00,632
Owen?

1539
01:18:00,709 --> 01:18:03,337
Yeah, I had about the same amount
of sex as I do in my home life.

1540
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:09,549
I love how this got cut, so that your shirt
gets ripped, but we don't know why.

1541
01:18:10,052 --> 01:18:13,818
You're suddenly wearing
an '80s, over-the-shoulder...

1542
01:18:13,889 --> 01:18:16,255
- It's a <i>Flashdance</i> homage.
- She's giving a blow job.

1543
01:18:17,426 --> 01:18:20,156
The MPAA made us take out a version
in which her head goes up and down.

1544
01:18:20,228 --> 01:18:23,755
They said,
"No head-up-and-down blow job shot."

1545
01:18:24,399 --> 01:18:26,560
We had two different takes.
She's just sort of down there.

1546
01:18:26,635 --> 01:18:29,263
The sad thing was that that was
an actual Craft Service cooler.

1547
01:18:29,337 --> 01:18:33,398
And there were snacks in there for the crew.

1548
01:18:33,875 --> 01:18:35,433
He was bare-assing it.

1549
01:18:36,478 --> 01:18:40,107
A lot of guys got E. Coli.
We lost the grip department that night.

1550
01:18:40,182 --> 01:18:43,549
- Are you saying that Harry's ass has E. Coli?
- Pinkeye, I think, went around after that.

1551
01:18:43,618 --> 01:18:47,110
Guys, it's pretty funny to know

1552
01:18:47,322 --> 01:18:50,450
how people just judge
this movie by the trailer.

1553
01:18:50,525 --> 01:18:54,154
- There was one that...
- Yeah, I don't get it. "This trailer sucks.

1554
01:18:54,229 --> 01:18:57,824
"This trailer's awful. The movie sucks."
I don't get the combo.

1555
01:18:58,100 --> 01:19:01,763
- Why does this have so many dislikes?
- There's the baby kangaroo that was...

1556
01:19:02,571 --> 01:19:03,936
Zack's younger brother.

1557
01:19:05,006 --> 01:19:06,803
- Got him a cameo.
- Travis, coming up.

1558
01:19:06,875 --> 01:19:09,002
- Oh, yeah.
- Great cameo by Travis.

1559
01:19:09,111 --> 01:19:12,672
First AC or second AC or... He's like loader.

1560
01:19:13,849 --> 01:19:15,783
He got his dick caught in a bong.

1561
01:19:16,118 --> 01:19:18,518
- Why did we cut the zip-line thing?
- I think he made 200 bucks for that

1562
01:19:18,587 --> 01:19:20,418
two seconds of work there.

1563
01:19:21,256 --> 01:19:25,420
There was a scene where Harry gets
on the zip-line and goes zooming down,

1564
01:19:25,494 --> 01:19:28,793
and then holds her and is like,
"It's not Nicole!" It was funny.

1565
01:19:32,968 --> 01:19:34,492
Guys, I have to read this one.

1566
01:19:34,569 --> 01:19:39,666
"Fuck this <i>Superbad</i> and every movie like it
that's come out in the past couple of years.

1567
01:19:39,741 --> 01:19:43,871
"All the actors look like the douche bags
in my school, BT dubs.

1568
01:19:43,945 --> 01:19:46,379
"OMG! And <i>Easy A,</i> too!

1569
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:50,908
"Did you guys hear about that 13 kid
that is a father?

1570
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:54,987
"Who gives a fuck about fucking...
Question mark, question mark.

1571
01:19:55,056 --> 01:19:57,752
"Explanation point. Question.
Explanation point.

1572
01:19:58,527 --> 01:20:00,017
- "To me..."
- Explanation point?

1573
01:20:00,562 --> 01:20:02,154
- What's an explanation point?
- Another Greyhound, Zack?

1574
01:20:02,230 --> 01:20:05,324
I don't know. No, no, no. He spelled that out.

1575
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:07,027
- Explanation point?
- Yeah.

1576
01:20:07,736 --> 01:20:12,366
"To me, fucking is only about
making a goddamn kid.

1577
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:14,431
"Not being kool," spelled with a "K."

1578
01:20:14,810 --> 01:20:20,373
"And saying to your friends at lunch,
'Oh, man, y'all are gay. I'm fucked.'

1579
01:20:21,716 --> 01:20:26,483
"That is like modern day macho shit
for kids that don't even have chest hair.

1580
01:20:27,422 --> 01:20:29,856
"I'm a virgin and I'm more of a man."

1581
01:20:29,925 --> 01:20:35,420
And that has, no joke, 500 thumbs up.

1582
01:20:35,497 --> 01:20:36,930
No. No.

1583
01:20:38,834 --> 01:20:42,201
If people are really upset about this,

1584
01:20:42,270 --> 01:20:46,366
- how is this guy's grammar not...
- Under attack?

1585
01:20:46,441 --> 01:20:48,466
Come on. Grammar's hard.

1586
01:20:52,214 --> 01:20:54,148
Boner in five. There you go.

1587
01:20:54,216 --> 01:20:55,706
There you go.

1588
01:20:55,784 --> 01:20:58,685
Now, can you talk a little bit about how
we worked with the prop department

1589
01:20:58,753 --> 01:21:00,846
to make it look like you had an erection?

1590
01:21:03,291 --> 01:21:05,589
The prop department tickled Matt's balls.

1591
01:21:08,630 --> 01:21:12,589
They had a special feather
that they grabbed from a peacock.

1592
01:21:12,667 --> 01:21:16,296
How many of these takes did we do
where the camera turns...

1593
01:21:16,905 --> 01:21:19,897
- We did a bunch of alts.
- Lot of alts. Yeah.

1594
01:21:20,508 --> 01:21:22,032
...but you're gonna thank me later,

1595
01:21:22,110 --> 01:21:23,407
'cause your dick looks huge.

1596
01:21:23,478 --> 01:21:25,378
Now did you have fun shooting
that scene with Nicole?

1597
01:21:25,447 --> 01:21:27,642
Was that enjoyable or was it nerve-racking?

1598
01:21:27,716 --> 01:21:30,446
- Well, we're both really professional actors.
- Yeah.

1599
01:21:30,685 --> 01:21:34,849
And we really went at it
like professionals do.

1600
01:21:36,558 --> 01:21:38,355
And did you feel closer to her?

1601
01:21:39,027 --> 01:21:41,120
Something got close to her.

1602
01:21:43,965 --> 01:21:46,297
So, I don't know,
one of my favorite scenes in the movie.

1603
01:21:46,401 --> 01:21:48,232
It's good to go out with a good one.

1604
01:21:48,303 --> 01:21:51,830
But something happened here,
where there's some great confusion.

1605
01:21:51,907 --> 01:21:53,374
And this is genuine Zack.

1606
01:21:53,441 --> 01:21:59,243
Yeah. I was playing high, but I really didn't
know what we were talking about.

1607
01:21:59,314 --> 01:22:01,680
- Were you high at all during the scene?
- No.

1608
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:06,380
Were either of you guys ever, in any
of the shots or scenes, drunk or high?

1609
01:22:06,588 --> 01:22:07,680
- No.
- Never?

1610
01:22:07,756 --> 01:22:09,280
Confused. Confused.

1611
01:22:12,027 --> 01:22:13,619
- "Give him some minutes."
- "Give him some minutes."

1612
01:22:13,695 --> 01:22:15,788
- Yeah.
- Sweet berry wine.

1613
01:22:15,864 --> 01:22:20,164
That was one thing I was really
concerned with, is people being like,

1614
01:22:21,136 --> 01:22:23,832
"That's how movies are made.
People just get drunk and high."

1615
01:22:23,905 --> 01:22:24,929
"Get fucked up."

1616
01:22:26,241 --> 01:22:29,768
It's a long day. If you're getting drunk
and high while we're shooting, it would be...

1617
01:22:29,844 --> 01:22:31,709
- It would be more like today.
- Today.

1618
01:22:34,249 --> 01:22:36,114
- Here we go.
- You would not be getting very far

1619
01:22:36,184 --> 01:22:37,378
- in the day.
- Look at this.

1620
01:22:37,452 --> 01:22:39,420
This is true confusion in my face.

1621
01:22:39,587 --> 01:22:41,282
What's the name of the geyser?

1622
01:22:41,356 --> 01:22:43,119
- Old Geyser.
- No.

1623
01:22:44,426 --> 01:22:45,484
That idiot.

1624
01:22:47,062 --> 01:22:48,427
We've all been there.

1625
01:22:49,564 --> 01:22:50,997
Cookout pulls it out.

1626
01:22:51,066 --> 01:22:54,058
Here's, here's a better question.
Did Matt pull out?

1627
01:22:54,235 --> 01:22:55,395
Good question.

1628
01:22:56,037 --> 01:22:57,231
"Hell no."

1629
01:22:57,906 --> 01:22:59,601
Just quote the movie for the rest of the...

1630
01:23:00,075 --> 01:23:01,633
Oh, my God, this is amazing.

1631
01:23:01,977 --> 01:23:05,105
"White people..."
I love when it starts with white people.

1632
01:23:05,780 --> 01:23:08,442
White people are Jews.

1633
01:23:08,883 --> 01:23:11,215
"White people have to start acting
like they have some sense

1634
01:23:11,286 --> 01:23:15,586
"instead of making movies like this.
Man, I can't believe this kind of shit

1635
01:23:15,657 --> 01:23:19,184
"they waste their money making.
Make some good movies instead

1636
01:23:19,260 --> 01:23:20,818
"about something that actually matters.

1637
01:23:20,895 --> 01:23:24,023
"I don't care about some stupid white boy
losing his virginity."

1638
01:23:25,533 --> 01:23:28,832
That's funny and everything,
but Huck and I are both black.

1639
01:23:30,739 --> 01:23:33,833
So it's kind of weird for them to...

1640
01:23:39,347 --> 01:23:41,338
All of this stuff actually happened.

1641
01:23:41,649 --> 01:23:43,014
- That happened.
- That happened.

1642
01:23:43,084 --> 01:23:44,381
- This action...
- That was Matt.

1643
01:23:44,452 --> 01:23:46,044
- That's Matt. That was your scary moment.
- This happened.

1644
01:23:46,121 --> 01:23:47,850
- That was really fun.
- When was that?

1645
01:23:48,456 --> 01:23:49,650
This is fun.

1646
01:23:50,258 --> 01:23:52,920
That was fabricated. That was fabricated.

1647
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:56,094
- That knee slap was not.
- Happened.

1648
01:23:56,164 --> 01:23:58,792
- That happened.
- She definitely ate that pizza.

1649
01:23:58,867 --> 01:23:59,959
That happened.

1650
01:24:00,035 --> 01:24:01,866
- That happened.
- And now we're about to review

1651
01:24:01,936 --> 01:24:03,494
<i>It's Kind of a Funny Story.</i>

1652
01:24:03,571 --> 01:24:04,697
Yeah.

1653
01:24:05,707 --> 01:24:06,867
It shares the same music.

1654
01:24:06,941 --> 01:24:08,499
Now, on to our second commentary.

1655
01:24:08,576 --> 01:24:11,170
- Ida Maria is doing good this fall.
- Yeah.

1656
01:24:12,313 --> 01:24:16,340
- There we go, the infamous college shirt.
- It's funny, because this montage

1657
01:24:16,418 --> 01:24:18,113
is kind of where it all started
for Andrew and I,

1658
01:24:18,186 --> 01:24:20,518
because we found a montage
like this online,

1659
01:24:20,588 --> 01:24:27,118
a great collage of footage
from this group of friends' life.

1660
01:24:28,163 --> 01:24:30,393
And they just strung it together.

1661
01:24:30,465 --> 01:24:31,489
- That was fun.
- At the end of the day,

1662
01:24:31,566 --> 01:24:34,865
we put it all together.
And it kind of came full circle for us.

1663
01:24:35,437 --> 01:24:37,769
If you guys missed it,
I just did a truffle shuffle.

1664
01:24:39,107 --> 01:24:41,769
And that's me doing dumb faces.
That's me doing another dumb face.

1665
01:24:41,843 --> 01:24:44,175
- It's my favorite gag. I love this.
- Yeah.

1666
01:24:44,245 --> 01:24:45,473
Everybody just gets on the train.

1667
01:24:45,547 --> 01:24:46,844
Everybody shut up.

1668
01:24:48,483 --> 01:24:50,883
- It's okay to talk. They can turn it off.
- This is a...

1669
01:24:50,952 --> 01:24:54,820
Hey, this is also Owen feeding John lines

1670
01:24:54,889 --> 01:24:56,618
and just seeing how John delivers.

1671
01:24:56,724 --> 01:24:59,557
Because, really,
you give John any line to deliver

1672
01:24:59,627 --> 01:25:02,653
and it'll come out in a way
that is truly special.

1673
01:25:03,598 --> 01:25:08,262
I remember this being halfway
through filming and everyone was lagging.

1674
01:25:08,336 --> 01:25:10,668
- This brought everyone back.
- Everybody up. I agree.

1675
01:25:10,738 --> 01:25:12,000
- Yeah, it was really...
- It was the best.

1676
01:25:12,073 --> 01:25:13,734
He sparked everybody, John.

1677
01:25:13,808 --> 01:25:14,968
- That was my favorite thing.
- Yeah.

1678
01:25:15,043 --> 01:25:16,874
- We're done.
- There we go, Andrew and Huck Botko.

1679
01:25:16,945 --> 01:25:18,469
Give them a hand, how about it?

1680
01:25:18,546 --> 01:25:20,673
Producers Will and Adam.

1681
01:25:21,749 --> 01:25:24,149
Chris, Peter, Paul and Mary.

1682
01:25:25,887 --> 01:25:27,411
- There he is.
- Owen Burke.

1683
01:25:28,289 --> 01:25:30,757
- I don't know who that is.
- Amy Hobby.

1684
01:25:31,659 --> 01:25:34,025
- I don't know that guy.
- Luke Geissbuhler, we mentioned.

1685
01:25:34,095 --> 01:25:36,689
- We talked about that guy.
- Geoffrey Richman, edited the movie.

1686
01:25:36,764 --> 01:25:39,324
Geoffrey Richman,
funny stories about that guy.

1687
01:25:40,101 --> 01:25:41,363
Mark Barnard.

1688
01:25:42,403 --> 01:25:43,768
Zork Porlboard.

1689
01:25:45,773 --> 01:25:48,071
- Jodi Collins!
- Jodi Collins! I love you, Jodi.

1690
01:25:48,143 --> 01:25:50,168
- I love you, too.
- I haven't seen her in forever.

1691
01:25:50,245 --> 01:25:51,906
A Columbia poop-shops...

1692
01:25:52,847 --> 01:25:54,474
A Gary San-pap.

1693
01:25:58,419 --> 01:25:59,443
Capst.

1694
01:25:59,521 --> 01:26:01,489
Map. Map Barnard.

1695
01:26:01,556 --> 01:26:03,649
- Zack Pearlboard.
- Your dad's back.

1696
01:26:03,725 --> 01:26:05,386
Look, there's my son's name!

1697
01:26:05,460 --> 01:26:07,087
- Shut up.
- Zack Pearlman.

1698
01:26:07,495 --> 01:26:08,655
Oh, my God.

1699
01:26:09,597 --> 01:26:12,498
Don't you have some vaginas to attend to?

1700
01:26:13,067 --> 01:26:17,834
I do. I'm doing vagina checks at the Target
up the street.

1701
01:26:18,773 --> 01:26:20,536
Who's Hipster?

1702
01:26:20,909 --> 01:26:24,072
Yeah, who is Hipster? Bill Posley.

1703
01:26:24,145 --> 01:26:26,375
- Google it right now.
- I love Frat Guy.

1704
01:26:26,447 --> 01:26:28,506
Dream Shop Owner?

1705
01:26:28,583 --> 01:26:29,709
Dress Shop!

1706
01:26:30,218 --> 01:26:32,083
- Zack, I have terrible news.
- What?

1707
01:26:32,153 --> 01:26:36,613
Hannah was waiting in the car and I didn't
roll down the window, so her brain boiled.

1708
01:26:36,691 --> 01:26:39,558
Sweet Hannah! Sweet Hannah!

1709
01:26:40,094 --> 01:26:41,584
My dad just ran off crying.

1710
01:26:43,765 --> 01:26:45,562
He's in the back of the room crying.

1711
01:26:46,467 --> 01:26:47,559
- All right.
- All right.

1712
01:26:47,635 --> 01:26:49,068
Clinkinbeard?

1713
01:26:49,537 --> 01:26:52,734
We apologize for anyone
who had to listen to this.

1714
01:26:52,807 --> 01:26:55,105
That guy's name is Mike Bonnett.

1715
01:26:55,176 --> 01:26:56,234
No.

1716
01:26:56,311 --> 01:26:58,211
- There's a Mike!
- There was a Jarrid Clinkinbeard.

1717
01:26:58,279 --> 01:26:59,940
- The huge guy? You remember that guy?
- Oh, Mike.

1718
01:27:00,014 --> 01:27:01,174
That guy was awesome.

1719
01:27:01,249 --> 01:27:04,082
- Scotty Morris!
- Zack Earl Edwards.

1720
01:27:04,152 --> 01:27:07,679
Daniel Mortenson III tried to sell us weed,
and we said, "No, we're not like that."

1721
01:27:07,755 --> 01:27:11,316
We're not like that. There's Victoria Valles.

1722
01:27:12,293 --> 01:27:15,626
Naomi Goodman cut most
of our SUPERZACK1000.

1723
01:27:15,697 --> 01:27:16,823
Yeah, she was great.

1724
01:27:16,898 --> 01:27:18,832
- Zack Booger.
- Zack Booger.

1725
01:27:21,302 --> 01:27:23,827
- Joe.
- Joe DiValerio.

1726
01:27:23,905 --> 01:27:26,339
- You were asking about him earlier, Andrew.
- Ken Weinstein, who is

1727
01:27:26,407 --> 01:27:29,843
- a billionaire who does this for fun.
- Gandhar Savur is actually my father.

1728
01:27:33,114 --> 01:27:34,672
Hey, by the way...

1729
01:27:36,484 --> 01:27:39,078
Just today, we put up iTunes.

1730
01:27:39,153 --> 01:27:42,384
Not that it's gonna be just today,
for everybody listening, but

1731
01:27:42,457 --> 01:27:45,585
- the <i>Virginity Hit</i> soundtrack is on iTunes.
- Wow. I'm gonna go buy that.

1732
01:27:45,660 --> 01:27:47,651
It's a great soundtrack.

1733
01:27:48,396 --> 01:27:49,954
Lot of great music in this movie.

1734
01:27:50,465 --> 01:27:52,865
I got to tell you, <i>Lovesick Teenagers.</i>

1735
01:27:54,636 --> 01:27:57,161
My <i>Imaginary Friend</i> had a <i>Plastic Army.</i>

1736
01:27:57,238 --> 01:27:59,502
And love you. Did I <i>Love You Better?</i>

1737
01:27:59,574 --> 01:28:02,008
You <i>Knives, Bats, New Tats.</i>

1738
01:28:04,178 --> 01:28:05,475
<i>All But Over Now.</i>

1739
01:28:15,423 --> 01:28:18,187
All right, everybody. Matt?

1740
01:28:18,259 --> 01:28:20,557
Go on to the end, Andrew.
Andrew wants to leave,

1741
01:28:20,628 --> 01:28:23,392
but we're finishing what we started.

1742
01:28:23,464 --> 01:28:27,525
Andrew, literally, is naked, ready to leave.

1743
01:28:28,136 --> 01:28:31,003
- Which I don't know why he's naked, but...
- That's not all.

1744
01:28:38,146 --> 01:28:41,013
Zack, look at your dead sister.
Look at Hannah!

1745
01:28:41,082 --> 01:28:44,984
- Why did you bring her in here?
- Look at her. Sweet Hannah!

1746
01:28:45,053 --> 01:28:46,918
That's not even my sister. That's a dog!

1747
01:28:46,988 --> 01:28:48,216
Oh, God!

1748
01:28:48,656 --> 01:28:51,716
Sparkles! I killed Sparkles!

1749
01:28:51,793 --> 01:28:54,455
Guys, I'd like to throw a special thanks out

1750
01:28:54,529 --> 01:28:56,520
to The Office of
Entertainment Industry Development

1751
01:28:56,597 --> 01:28:58,360
and the People of Louisiana.

1752
01:29:00,301 --> 01:29:05,603
DTS. Down... Down To Suck... Matt.

1753
01:29:05,973 --> 01:29:09,841
If I could show you what he was doing,
he's doing like a crab dance.

1754
01:29:13,915 --> 01:29:15,075
Guys.

1755
01:29:16,250 --> 01:29:17,274
What is this?

1756
01:29:17,352 --> 01:29:19,411
Have you never heard this? Listen, it's good.

1757
01:29:19,487 --> 01:29:20,579
No.

1758
01:29:21,956 --> 01:29:23,218
<i>Oh, Matty</i>

1759
01:29:25,159 --> 01:29:26,990
<i>I thought I'd give you Sunny's hole</i>

1760
01:29:27,061 --> 01:29:28,926
Yeah, this is the one I wrote.

1761
01:29:28,996 --> 01:29:30,486
No, Andrew wrote this.

1762
01:29:31,099 --> 01:29:34,694
He wrote that "Sunny's hole" line,
or he threw it out in the moment.

1763
01:29:35,336 --> 01:29:38,100
- It was an ad-lib.
- It's a collaborative effort.

1764
01:29:38,172 --> 01:29:39,935
- "So romantic."
- "So romantic."

1765
01:29:40,007 --> 01:29:42,339
- Great way to end it.
- There's a weird lady.

1766
01:29:42,410 --> 01:29:44,173
- Weird lady.
- Thanks for listening. Not.
