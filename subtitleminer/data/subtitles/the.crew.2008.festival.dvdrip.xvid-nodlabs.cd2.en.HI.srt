00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,514
There's only two ways
this can go now, Lepi.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,314
We either have an all-out fucking war

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,559
or we find a nice quiet spot
so that my cousin Moby

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,116
- and that fucking shithouse...
- Fuck you!

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,679
So that my cousin Moby and that
fucking shithouse can have a one-on-one.

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,713
- The choice is yours.
- One-on-one, huh?

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,549
It's called a straightener. It's what
we fucking do in this city, Lepi.

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,595
Although it's probably a bit too
fucking civilised for the likes of you!

9
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,710
Like a duel, huh? How suave.

10
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,550
Be there tomorrow morning, 8am.
No crew. No fucking tools.

11
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,036
- No problem.
- You'd fucking hope so, wouldn't you?

12
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,231
[yells in Serbian]

13
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,469
All fucking Brennans are fucking crazy!

14
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,275
- £900! You do this to me for £900!
- Have we... Lepi, have we got a...

15
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,631
Have we got a fucking...
Have we got a fucking deal?!

16
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,513
- Don't you fucking touch me.
- The meeting is over.

17
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,188
- I need to speak to Lepi now.
- Motherfucker.

18
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,437
I'm not going out the front.
Where's the fucking back door?

19
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,394
The meeting's over.
Get the fuck out of here.

20
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,034
Just fucking... Fuck off!

- All right.
- Gerard.

29
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,518
Francis.

30
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,870
- Your dad sends his regards.
- Does he, now?

31
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:00,072
You should go and see him.

32
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,477
- I don't think so.
- How's tricks?

33
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,598
Can't complain, Francis. How about you?

34
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:15,511
Yeah, not too bad. Heard you had
a bit of trouble with a blag.

35
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,795
Yeah, it was nothing, really, mate.

36
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,513
Right. Let's have a proper drink
and a chat later.

37
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,917
- That'd be nice.
- Thanks for coming.

38
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,835
[taps glass]

39
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,479
I'd just like to thank yous all
for coming here today

40
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,151
and for helping make it a nice day
for Leo's family.

41
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,958
We all know Leo was no angel,
but he wasn't a bad man.

42
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,675
He had respect. He was loyal.

43
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,592
Honest. Old school.

44
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,715
He was a fucking good businessman.

45
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,196
Made me a lot of money, didn't he?

46
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,710
You see, the problem is,
these young crews today,

47
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,753
they've got no respect.

48
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,428
They think the flash cars
and the fancy clothes

49
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,596
make them real men.

50
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,357
And when I catch who's done this,

51
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,790
and I will fucking catch them...

52
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,196
...then we'll see who the real men are.

53
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,075
Now, if you'd all like to stand
and raise your glasses.

54
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,476
And join me in a toast.

55
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,800
- To Leo.
- [all] To Leo.

56
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,556
Safe journey.

57
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:25,033
There's a little bit of
adult entertainment for you here, boys.

58
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,630
So enjoy yourselves.
Feel free to tip the girls.

59
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,751
You all know where the slots are.

60
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,079
Here's your drinks.

61
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,714
Don't give him a drink, all right?

62
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,798
- Not for him. No drinks for him.
- I've only had one beer.

63
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,515
You've got a straightener
in the morning, soft shite.

64
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,712
- You're making a cunt out of me.
- You're all right.

65
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:24,038
- I'll not have a drink.
- You're fucking right.

66
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,959
So do me a favour. Fuck off home! Now!

67
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,148
You'll thank me in the morning
when you're not nursing a hangover.

68
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:37,275
I'll pick you up at seven o'clock. Maybe
next time you'll fucking listen to me!

69
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,038
- [indistinct]
- Do you wanna take his place?

70
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,714
All right, Moby.

71
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,995
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I spoke to the Irishman about the thing.

72
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,510
- Two whiskies, Joe.
- Coming up, Franner.

73
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,429
- You heard anything about Leo?
- Serbs. That's all I've heard.

74
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,996
- That's what we got told.
- That's why I wanna make this tender.

75
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,192
Big step up for you, lad.

76
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,589
- I'm good for it.
- Leo had a good network.

77
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,234
Solid custom guaranteed.

78
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:56,797
Whoever takes it on has gotta be able to
maintain that. Think you can handle it?

79
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,515
- Sorted.
- Should have come to me first.

80
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,429
The normal scheme of things,
that's exactly what I would have done.

81
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:08,110
Things are not normal, Franner.
I had to move quick on this.

82
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,150
I take it your Gerard
knows fuck all about this.

83
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,920
I'd like to keep it like that.
It's not his scene.

84
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,997
He's got his own things happening.

85
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,397
I just wanted to get myself set up,
have my own little thing going.

86
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,910
You good for the money?
Don't fuck them boys about.

87
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,599
It's sweet.

88
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,157
All right.

89
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,796
Keep in touch.

90
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,392
Come on.

91
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,149
- You are one dirty bastard.
- More right.

92
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,510
More right.

93
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,756
Whoa. Back up.

94
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,517
More.

95
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,551
Back. Whoa, whoa.

96
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,313
OK. Go.

97
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,839
Go.

98
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:31,155
- Push.
- I'm pushing, you dirty fuck.

99
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,636
It's coming.

100
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,512
I see it.

101
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,479
Push!

102
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,836
[smashing glass]

103
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,636
Look at me.

104
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,596
Good night, was it?

105
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,312
No.

106
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,716
Wanna tell me about it?

107
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,830
- No.
- No.

108
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,678
[Ged] You ever thought
of doing anything different?

109
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,395
You know, if we didn't do what we do.

110
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,636
[Moby] What do you mean?

111
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,713
I don't know, Moby. Just...

112
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,473
A business or something.

113
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:22,753
Something different.
There has to be something different.

114
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,837
Years ago
I thought of getting a pet shop.

115
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:32,079
Exotic pets, snakes, iguanas,
that sort of thing.

116
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,392
- You in a shop?
- Yeah.

117
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,274
Why? What's wrong with that?

118
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,755
Nothing.

119
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,239
- So what stopped you?
- I don't know.

120
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,557
Things come up. You get sidetracked.

121
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,113
Years go by and then it's too late.

122
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,676
Do you regret that?

123
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,116
I sometimes think about it.

124
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,955
Well, it's not too late, you know.

125
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,550
Yeah. Maybe. Why?

126
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:22,309
After this next job, I'm out.

127
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,032
- I've got the fear.
- Come on.

128
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:34,678
I keep feeling my luck's running out,
and if it does... I can't do the time.

129
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:40,433
Not with my little one.
Kid needs a father.

130
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,117
Your Fitzy's getting to that age.
Don't you feel the same way?

131
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,437
- I've never really thought about it.
- You should.

132
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,276
Aren't you tired?

133
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,709
Constantly pulling blags
and knocking skulls together.

134
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,152
I quite like it, actually,
especially the last bit.

135
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,431
- Morning!
- Here we go.

136
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,596
You think about it.

137
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,236
Now go and knock his fucking head off.

138
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,151
Shall we get on with it, then?

139
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,873
- Let's go.
- Let's go!

140
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,516
I'm so tired.

141
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,476
You know after you left the other night?
I lay there for hours.

142
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,752
- Really?
- I kept thinking about you.

143
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,875
Yeah. Me too.

144
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,031
Thanks for everything, Pam.
I'm having the most amazing time.

145
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,595
- You're welcome.
- You've been brilliant.

146
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,076
I'll pop round as soon as I can.
No problem. Bye.

147
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,713
- Nice to see you ladies working hard.
- Darling. Join us for breakfast.

148
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,799
I'd love to, but I just dropped in
to see Ged. Is he around?

149
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,275
He left early this morning.

150
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,478
I've been told that we'll be signing
for the land tomorrow.

151
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,513
- Four o'clock at our house.
- Brilliant.

152
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,109
Everything's been approved, so we're on.

153
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,835
It's just today is the final chance
to get everyone's commitment.

154
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,479
- Sorry, Debs.
- Oh, no, listen. I'll give him a call.

155
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,989
- I'm sure he won't be long.
- I need to get going.

156
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,713
It's no problem.

157
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,910
- [mutters]
- Tighter.

158

[phone rings]

159
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,510
Ged, can you call me, please?

160
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,676
It's gone to voice mail.

161
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:31,550
Oh, bollocks. Um... I'm not sure
I'm going to be able to get back.

162
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,751
What time does the money
have to be in by?

163
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,076
- Noon.
- Can't you pay Ged's part now?

164
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,350
- He'll pay you later.
- It's a lot of money.

165
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,755
Keith, don't be so rude.
Ged's got the money.

166
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:44,953
- Debs, I'm really sorry.
- Hang on. How much is outstanding?

167
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,516
- 140,000. But we can take care of it.
- No, stay... Wait there.

168
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,312
Fucking cunt!

169
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,196
[yelling]

Moby. Moby.

171
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,276
I think the lad's had enough.

172
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,112
This ends now.

173
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,916
I think you know what I mean.

174
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,872
- 82... Come on, lad. 83...
- [phone jingle]

175
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,231
84... Go on.
Keep going, lad. Keep going.

176
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,874
Yeah. Lepi?

177
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,834
Your proposition regarding your brother?

178
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,956
You have yourself a deal, matey.

179
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,514
We're on. We're fucking on, lad.

180
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,029
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

181
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,117
[Ged, muffled] Deb?
Deb, are you OK? Are you OK?

182
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,360
- Debbie, are you OK? Are you OK?
- What?

183
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,993
- Where is the fucking money, Debbie?!
- What?

184
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,237
- Where is the fucking money, Debbie?
- I gave it to Keith.

185
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,234
- Keith came round here for it?
- For the land sale.

186
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,715
He had to get the money today.

187
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,992
- So why didn't you call me?
- I did. You didn't answer the phone.

188
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,430
How much did you give him?
It wasn't all there.

189
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,552
- Some in the safe and I had some...
- How much?!

190
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,318
108,000.

191
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,954
Don't worry about it.
I'll make up the rest.

192
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,513
Thank you, darling.

193
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,075
Tell Ged he can pay me back
when he's got it.

194
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,277
- Are you drunk?
- What?

195
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,916
We have been celebrating.
Is it because I gave it to him?

196
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,156
Ged, get off!

197
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,396
- Phone Pamela.
- I'm not phoning Pamela.

198
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,717
- Stop panicking. Everything is fine.
- I'm going round there.

199
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,831
- What for?
- Because I wanna see him!

200
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,315
OK, let me have a shower.
I'm coming with you.

201
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,794
I'm going now, Debbie.

202
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,116
All right, lads?

203
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,635
Richie. You wanted to see me.

204
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,915
His sister's been seeing one of them
fucking Lepi's boys, hasn't she?

205
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:29,114
Told him they're planning on robbing
thousands of them new PlayStations.

206
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:32,710
Well, the Brennans
have planned the same job.

207
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:36,276
It's gonna fucking kick off
big time, kidda.

208
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,119
- You want a ton for that?
- Yeah, of course.

209
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,629
Why would she say that?

210
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,956
I'll be in touch.

211
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,276
Keep your eye on him.

212
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,116
Are you all right?

213
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,396
[smashing glass]

214
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,755
You have got to be fucking kidding me.

215
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,232
Fuck!

216
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,753
<i>[Pamela] Vamos a quedar aquí in casa</i>
<i>por un poco de tiempo.</i>

217
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,714
[Keith] Check it out with him.
Tell him to stop dicking me around.

218
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,876
<i>Y, Monica, estaremos aquíí esta noche.</i>

219
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:09,517
[Keith] Hang on a second. Monica.
Monica, get me a beer or something.

220
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,790
Yeah, I need you to do something for me.

221
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,355
Yeah. Cayman Islands account.

222
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,438
I need you to transfer
the money for me. Yeah.

223
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:21,713
<i>It's 003-795-160.</i>

224
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,275
<i>No, it went like a dream.</i>

225
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:30,713
Don't worry about it. Don't worry about
it. I left them a bottle of champagne.

226
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,036
I'll catch you later. I'm a happy man.

227
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,753
Are you?

228
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,513
No!

229
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,273
- I love you.
- I love you too.

230
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,473
See you. Congratulations.

231
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,636
- See you later.
- Bye.

232
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,430
- We should celebrate.
- Definitely.

233
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,676
I don't fucking believe this.

234
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,912
I must be losing my fucking touch.

235
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,588
What a fucking mess.

236
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,758
But they were our friends.

237
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,234
Excuse me?

238
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:26,119
Friends? They weren't our friends.
They were never our fucking friends.

239
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,471
- They've been planning this for months.
- God.

240
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,636
I just can't believe
she'd do this to me.

241
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,716
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
What the fuck are you talking?

242
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,354
What the fuck are you talk?

243
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,994
Oh, you... Look at me!

244
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,034
Look at me! Look at me.
Look at your husband. Look at me.

245
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:57,995
Mm? Open your eyes, Debbie.
Fucking open your eyes.

246
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,918
Little fucking pretty cokehead,
was she, eh?

247
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:05,556
Little fucking pretty cokehead?
Reeled you in, didn't she?

248
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,593
Well, she fucking
ripped you off, Debbie!

249
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,997
- They've fucked off with the money!
- No! She wouldn't do it to me!

250
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:16,113
She wouldn't do it to me!

251
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,072
Fuck!

252
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:30,152
Jimmy? I'm coming over
to your place right now.

253
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,316
No, right fucking now, Jimmy!

254
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,116
- What's up?
- Get in.

255
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,948
There's a change of plan.
We're doing the first truck.

256
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:55,277
What? That's in two days' time.

257
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:59,155
It's too soon. Anyway, I'm not driving
that one. I'm driving the third...

258
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,113
Jimmy, we're doing
the first fucking truck.

259
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,390
You make sure you're fucking driving it.

260
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,912
Fuck.

261
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,075
Ged, it's gonna cost you.

262
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,678
Fucking say that to me again.
Fucking!

263
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,030
Tell me you're not fucking
taking the piss!

264
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,595
- All right.
- You're getting enough out of this.

265
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,236
Just fucking make sure
you're on that fucking truck!

266
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,396
Go on, fuck off!

267
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,269
Fucking...

268
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,915
[Ged]... be prepared, and we're now
doing it on the 20th. OK?

269
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,157
[Moby] Does it have to be that day?
Can't we do the second one?

270
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:16,990
Anthony, I'll get you back in time
for your communion. Stop worrying.

271
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,999
- You're late.
- What's the panic?

272
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:27,071
Changed the date, lad.
We're doing the first one on the 20th.

273
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:31,319
- Same day as the communion.
- He says we'll be finished before that.

274
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,478
Since when do you give a fuck
about a communion?

275
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,755
- 20th a problem for you?
- No, it's sound.

276
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,394
It's not a problem, Ged.

277

Francis.

279
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,951
- Are you up for going to the communion?
- [Ratter] Course I am.

280
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,636
What, now?

281
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,709
Well, yeah. I'm kind of in the middle
of something. Can't it wait?

282
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:08,117
- [Ratter] What are you wearing?
- [Moby] A suit, I think.

283
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,677
George, I'll see you later.

284
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:19,112
Right, guys, see yous all on the 20th.

285
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,595
- Get a good rest, eh?
- So that's it?

286
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,360
I was fucking called here for that?
Are we finished?

287
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:28,030
- He's changed the plans?
- Don't worry about that.

288
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,836
Tell Lepi it's the same job,
details, route, just a different date.

289
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,314
Got you.

290
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:38,229
Don't make it sound as if it's anything
to panic about. Don't flap.

291
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,749
Flap? What do you mean? I don't flap.

292
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,679
- What the fuck are you doing now?
- I don't fucking flap!

293
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,518
For fuck's sake, Paul!

294
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,116
Get out the car.

You get in the car.

296
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,874

All right, lads.

00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,116
- Fucking...
- Francis.

309
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,075
Fucking take him down, will you?

310
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,998
- Tell him.
- Ratter.

311
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:23,272
- Who?
- [yells] It was Ratter.

312
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,516
- Fucking hell.
- Tell him. Tell him.

313
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,312
Tell him what you told me.

314
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,312
- Who?
- Ratter.

315
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,795
Who?! Who told you?

316
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,514
Francis...

317
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,392
Who told you?

318
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,556
Ratter! Fucking Ratter!

319
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,519
Ratter told me.

320
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,950
- What did he tell you to do?
- To kill Leo.

321
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,912
- What?
- To kill Leo.

322
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,509
Just shut him up now.

323
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,311
- Kill Leo!
- Shut him up now.

324
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,590
- Fucking why?
- To take over his patch.

325
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,199
Ratter told us to do it.

326
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,834
- That's enough now.
- What the fuck are you doing?

327
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:07,511
Shut the boy up. You know
I've got fuck all to do with this.

328
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:10,314
- Do I?
- Yes, you fucking do.

329
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:16,199
You see, he would have had
to have had the nod from you, Francis.

330
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,039
You fucking did,
cos I watched you do it.

331
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:23,752
Tell me you fucking gave him the nod.
You gave him the nod.

332
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:27,999
Yeah, to take over Leo's patch,
but not to fucking kill him.

333
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,952
I can't believe you'd do that to me!

334
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:34,995
I can't fucking believe you're making
little land deals behind my back

335
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,555
without cutting me in on it.

336
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,110
But we do things, Gerard.

337
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,796
It's what we do.

338
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,436
All right.

339
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,918
This... This PlayStation thing.

340
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,598
- You're gonna have to drop it.
- Fucking no chance.

341
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,756
I'm fucking doing it.

342
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:08,271
I fucking am. I'm doing it, Franner.

343
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,912
I've heard the Serbs
are gonna be involved.

344
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,237
Be a fucking blood bath.
You wanna watch yourself.

345
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,159
That is a fucking chance I'm gonna take.
Understand me?

346
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,920
Because I'm fucking doing that job.

347
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,156
Besides, that little fucking land deal
has gone fucking tits up.

348
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,032
[Richie groans]

349
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,629
Fucked off with my money.

350
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,156
Are you telling me you got shafted?

351
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,392
Yeah. I'm losing my fucking touch.

352
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,477
- Who was it?
- Slick little fucker.

353
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:47,389
Called himself Keith Thompson.
Fucking little husband and wife team.

354
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,512
I checked him out. He seemed kosher.

355
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,553
I fucking hold my hands up.
They fucking took me for a ride.

356
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:58,231
That is why I am fucking doing this job!
Do you fucking understand me?!

357
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,396
I fucking need it!

358
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,955
Don't fuck... Don't fucking stop me!

359
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,870
- Gerard...
- Don't fucking stop me.

360
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,310
I'm not asking.

361
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:13,832
I'm telling you. For your own good.

362
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,835
You're not doing it.

363
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,156
[Richie] Please...

364
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,355
Maybe you're right.

365
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:34,159
See? Wasn't that hard, was it?

366
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,671
No.

367
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,235
Are you your brother's keeper?

368
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,517
No.

369
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,752
Don't worry about your kid.

370
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:10,753
I'll take care of that. For you.

371
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,634
OK?

372
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,956
You just clean this mess up.

373
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,596
Fuck off.

374
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,992
[Richie sobs] Please don't. Please.

375
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,750
- See you, Richie.
- Just get me down. Please.

376
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,679
Please, Ged. Please.

377
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,319
Please.

378
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:52,669
- Shh.
- Please. Please.

379
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,438
Don't...

380
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,988
Close your eyes.

381
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,634
Close your eyes. Close your eyes.

382
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,831
Shh, shh, shh.

383
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,519
Shh. Richie.

384
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:36,594
- Close your eyes.
- Please.

385
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,429
- Ged, please.
- Close your fucking eyes!

386
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,796
[cocks gun]

387
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,030
- Don't be late for that service, you.
- I'll be there.

388
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:57,556
We've fucking done it. We've done it!

389
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,469
After this,
no one will be fucking with us.

390
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,750
We're fucking gonna be untouchable.

391
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,916
It's just the fucking start, mate.

392
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:10,159
We'll be making much bigger fucking
deals than this, I promise you, lad.

393
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,799
Come on!

394
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,472
Listen, I'm gonna have to go, mate.
See you later. All right?

395
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,716
Oi, Jimmy.

396
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:31,517
You have to finish that before you get
in. There's no food or drink allowed.

397
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:36,032
- It's the rules.
- Jimmy! Jimmy! You haven't signed.

398
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,196
Oh, shit.

399
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,430
- Sorry, mate.
- OK, don't worry about it.

400
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:45,837
- All right. Don't panic.
- Yeah, all right.

401
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,676
- Ged.
- All right, boss.

402
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,836
All right.

403
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:54,798
Everyone's here,
but I can't fucking get hold of Rats.

404
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,836
He's not coming.

405
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,675
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

406
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:48,518
It's gonna be
the year of the fucking Rat, mate.

407
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,235
And the year of the fucking Hom.

408
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,399
Gerard? Gerard fucking who?

409
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:20,229
Shut the fuck up, will you, Paul, lad?
Fuck's sake.

410
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,673
- Can I have some more?
- Easy with that!

411
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:37,190
Checking in. One, two. Hear me?

412
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,914
All good this end.

413
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,549
Richie, it's Paul.
Get back to me, you little prick.

414
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:02,479
What's the story with Rats,
then, George? Why isn't he here?

415
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:05,513
Rats isn't coming. Simple as that.

416
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:09,190
End of story. So just forget
about the fucker, will you?

417
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,868
- The fucker should be here.
- Well, he's not, is he?

418
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,991
So just fucking shut up, will you?!

419
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,438
<i>This isn't like Ged. Last-minute job.</i>

420
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:22,916
Well, sometimes
plans have gotta change, haven't they?

421
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:25,554
That way, you stay ahead of the game,
don't you?

422
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:30,038
- If this is a dud, we're off.
- Fucking behave, will you?!

423
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:35,234
If Ged says it's gonna be a big one,
it's gonna be fucking big, all right?!

424
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:38,273
Eh, Tony, what if
these fucking Brennans show up, mate?

425
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,278
Fuck them. They won't turn up.
Don't worry about them.

426
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:44,438
We'll have to go right through
these cunts if theys turn up.

427
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,950
Shut the fuck up. Let's get this job
done and get the fuck out of here.

428
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:07,229
<i>[Ratter] You've forgotten who you are.</i>
<i>Trying to be the big fucking "I am".</i>

429
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,637
<i>- [Franner] I will catch them.</i>
<i>- [Richie] Fucking Ratter!</i>

430
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,596
<i>[Ged] Trust me.</i>

431
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,994
- Here we go, gents.
- 60 seconds to go.

432
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,790
Get out! Get the fuck out!

433
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,716
Fucking get out! Come on!

434
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,309
[yelling]

435
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:36,110
Ten minutes, boys! Ten minutes!

436
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,830
[yelling]

437
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:51,994
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Just in case.

438
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:56,239
Are you fucking stupid? It's Franner.
You can't carry a gun. Put it back.

439
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:58,590
I fucking mean it, lad. Put it back.

440
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:02,795
Fuck's sake.

441
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,719
What's got into you?

442
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,876
Now, look, let me do the talking.

443
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,113
Ahoy, shipmates.

444
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:41,791
All right, Franner. Didn't expect to see
you here, but it's always a pleasure.

445
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,276
- You have the cash, I presume?
- Yeah, it's all there.

446
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:50,309
And... Where are the goods?

447
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:55,351
There's a bit of a problem
on that score, boys.

448
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:59,951
Yeah, we've had a few developments
concerning a fat friend of ours.

449
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:03,992
Fuck!

450
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,756
[gunshots]

451
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,796
Paul!

452
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:35,916
Franner, mate, I can explain this.

453
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,190
We go fucking way back, don't we, now?

454
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:04,476
All right, go on.

455
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:11,790
- What else?
- We're running the old decoy system.

456
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,798
So they send out a dummy truck
on a different route.

457
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,072
I'm the dummy truck. The dummy truck.

458
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:24,670
I want all the information
on that decoy truck. All the routes.

459
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:29,320
What's the point?
They're all empty, aren't they?

460
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:34,553
- Just get it.
- Fucking hell.

461
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:39,350
Here you are. That's for your trouble.

462
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:44,477
- Make sure you drop them two far out.
- Not a bother.
