2
00:04:07,648 --> 00:04:08,273
Good night t'ee

3
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:09,649
Good night Sir John

4
00:04:17,192 --> 00:04:18,386
Begging your pardon, sir.

5
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:23,321
We met on this so same road to the day

6
00:04:23,999 --> 00:04:26,365
and I said goodnight and you replied

7
00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:27,761
"good night Sir john"

8
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:28,829
I may have

9
00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:31,099
Did so again today.

10
00:04:31,373 --> 00:04:32,101
So I did

11
00:04:32,509 --> 00:04:34,374
Now, why call me Sir John

12
00:04:34,544 --> 00:04:36,842
when I be plain Jack Durbeyfield,
the haggler?

13
00:04:37,047 --> 00:04:38,014
Just a whim of mind.

14
00:04:38,582 --> 00:04:41,176
I'm Parson Tringham,
by the way.

15
00:04:42,453 --> 00:04:43,818
I've made a discovery about you.

16
00:04:44,055 --> 00:04:45,579
I was tracing some family trees

17
00:04:45,823 --> 00:04:47,051
for our new county history.

18
00:04:47,558 --> 00:04:48,889
I'm an antiquarian, you know.

19
00:04:49,994 --> 00:04:52,862
You Durbeyfield are directly
descended from the

20
00:04:53,131 --> 00:04:54,860
knightly house of the d'Urbervilles.

21
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,560
Did you really not know that?

22
00:04:57,035 --> 00:04:58,229
Really really... falsely

23
00:04:58,437 --> 00:04:59,734
There's your head a little

24
00:04:59,938 --> 00:05:00,802
so I can see your face from the side

25
00:05:01,841 --> 00:05:04,503
Yes... that's the D'Urberville
nose and chin

26
00:05:05,144 --> 00:05:06,873
trifle crosser and bold but still

27
00:05:07,847 --> 00:05:08,336
in case my eyes

28
00:05:08,715 --> 00:05:10,182
According to the Battle Abbey Rolls,

29
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:12,476
your line goes back to
Sir Pagan who came from

30
00:05:12,653 --> 00:05:13,813
Normandy with William the Conqueror.

31
00:05:14,021 --> 00:05:16,546
Living away in rough all these year?

32
00:05:16,991 --> 00:05:17,923
Well I thought that you might

33
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:19,420
already know something about it

34
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:22,458
But t'is true

35
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:24,354
I've got myself an old
silver spoon at home and

36
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,792
graven seal which
i don't take much heed.

37
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:29,265
where do we D'Urbervilles live today?

38
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:31,666
You don't live anywhere

39
00:05:32,341 --> 00:05:35,401
you lie buried in your family
vaults of Kingsbere-

40
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:39,670
sub-Greenhill, laid out in lead
coffins, with you effigies

41
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:41,441
under marble canopies.

42
00:05:41,618 --> 00:05:42,676
do we have any family mansions?

43
00:05:43,086 --> 00:05:43,882
Oh, you haven't any

44
00:05:45,155 --> 00:05:46,315
no land neither?

45
00:05:47,491 --> 00:05:48,287
none at all?

46
00:05:48,926 --> 00:05:51,589
you had an abundance
of land in the old days

47
00:05:52,096 --> 00:05:53,028
what can i do about it sir?

48
00:05:54,532 --> 00:05:56,523
Well, as to that.....

49
00:05:56,968 --> 00:05:57,593
can I do nothing?

50
00:05:57,969 --> 00:05:58,867
nothing whatever

51
00:05:59,537 --> 00:06:02,132
except possibly chasten
yourself by thinking

52
00:06:02,908 --> 00:06:04,273
'how are the mighty fallen'.

53
00:06:05,411 --> 00:06:07,777
Good night, Sir John.

54
00:06:17,691 --> 00:06:19,454
what do you say to
a quart of beer with me sir?

55
00:06:20,528 --> 00:06:22,519
There's a grand brew
in at The Pure Drop.

56
00:06:25,366 --> 00:06:26,799
though not so good
as in Rolliver's.

57
00:06:34,176 --> 00:06:36,201
Sir John D'Urberville.

58
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:38,307
that's who I am.

59
00:07:49,826 --> 00:07:50,622
What is this?

60
00:07:51,928 --> 00:07:53,293
T'is our club dance, sir.

61
00:07:55,932 --> 00:07:56,956
But where are your partners?

62
00:07:57,434 --> 00:07:58,663
They've not finished work, yet.

63
00:07:59,136 --> 00:08:00,296
They'll be here by and by.

64
00:08:01,505 --> 00:08:03,473
Will you join us till then sir?

65
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:06,336
with pleasure. But one partner
won't go far amongst so many.

66
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:08,344
One is better than none

67
00:08:09,081 --> 00:08:11,811
it's sad working here when there's
noone to give you a squeeze.

68
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:15,879
what are you doing?

69
00:08:16,021 --> 00:08:17,683
I've a mind to enjoy myself
Come on you two

70
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:19,315
what if someone sees us?

71
00:08:20,026 --> 00:08:23,291
All rightyou go on.
I'll catch you up in five minutes

72
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:47,546
The nobliest in the county!

73
00:09:49,157 --> 00:09:51,990
Oh lord... if it isn't your father

74
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:53,492
riding home in a carriage?

75
00:09:53,862 --> 00:09:59,096
Hey! hey! The grandiest man
in the whole of Wessex!

76
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,098
Father's tired, that's all.

77
00:10:02,805 --> 00:10:05,104
he only sent for the cart
because our horse died.

78
00:10:05,576 --> 00:10:06,508
You know that very well.

79
00:10:41,882 --> 00:10:43,543
Ah! I'm glad you've come.

80
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:45,075
Where are you off to?

81
00:10:45,253 --> 00:10:46,515
I thought I'd change and help you.

82
00:10:46,754 --> 00:10:49,052
We want to tell you what happened.

83
00:10:50,258 --> 00:10:53,887
We've been found to be the
greatest gentle folk in the county

84
00:10:54,396 --> 00:10:57,194
Rooting back long before
Oliver Grumble's time

85
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:59,733
Back to the days of Pagen Turks

86
00:11:00,636 --> 00:11:02,695
With monuments and vaults

87
00:11:03,272 --> 00:11:04,968
and crests and coated arms

88
00:11:05,275 --> 00:11:06,572
and lord knows what all!

89
00:11:06,743 --> 00:11:09,735
Is that why father made a
mommet of himself on that cart?

90
00:11:09,946 --> 00:11:12,176
Our true name is D'Urberville

91
00:11:12,882 --> 00:11:14,407
that's why he came home in style

92
00:11:14,652 --> 00:11:15,949
not because he's been drinking.

93
00:11:16,854 --> 00:11:17,479
where is he now?

94
00:11:18,122 --> 00:11:19,487
T' was a Parson who told him

95
00:11:19,723 --> 00:11:21,020
the pedigree of the matter.

96
00:11:21,358 --> 00:11:22,052
Well where is he now?

97
00:11:22,626 --> 00:11:23,821
Well to tell you the truth

98
00:11:24,195 --> 00:11:25,719
he was that upset. He's gone off

99
00:11:26,131 --> 00:11:27,962
to the Rolliver's to get up his strength.

100
00:11:28,433 --> 00:11:31,163
not much strength he'll find
in the bottom of a pint pot.

101
00:11:31,369 --> 00:11:32,427
Well, I'll go and get him

102
00:11:32,804 --> 00:11:34,033
We'll be back before you know it.

103
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,604
now look be a good girl and
put the little ones to bed for me.

104
00:11:46,787 --> 00:11:47,549
Now there's!

105
00:11:51,158 --> 00:11:51,681
That?

106
00:11:52,659 --> 00:11:56,357
The spoon may be small
but my family was great.

107
00:11:56,564 --> 00:11:58,054
Jack, they've got a project.

108
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:00,460
We have a carriage, state,
mansions routing on...

109
00:12:00,768 --> 00:12:01,632
Listen, listen to me.

110
00:12:01,869 --> 00:12:02,734
Is there any money in it?

111
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:07,101
T'is well to be kin to a coach
even if we don't ride in one.

112
00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:10,069
I've been a-thinking since
you brought me the news.

113
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:11,279
I've got a project.

114
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:12,611
Which reminds me, woman,

115
00:12:13,116 --> 00:12:14,913
you better find that
damn seal of ours

116
00:12:15,385 --> 00:12:16,374
or i'll do you a mischief

117
00:12:16,987 --> 00:12:20,821
Listen, there's a great lady
by the name of D'Urberville,

118
00:12:21,057 --> 00:12:22,889
living out by Trantridge

119
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,025
Yeah, at least nothing
compares with us.

120
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:27,730
younger branch of our family no doubt.

121
00:12:28,366 --> 00:12:30,459
I'll wager that they don't go
back to king Norman's day.

122
00:12:31,635 --> 00:12:33,433
That as may be but she's rich.

123
00:12:34,206 --> 00:12:35,537
not a lot of good money will do us.

124
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:40,534
It could do. We must send
up our Tess to claim kin.

125
00:12:42,181 --> 00:12:43,011
Claim kin?

126
00:12:43,549 --> 00:12:45,744
Why should two branches
of the same family be

127
00:12:46,252 --> 00:12:47,844
unvisiting too?

128
00:12:48,554 --> 00:12:50,681
Certainly put her in the
way of grand marriage.

129
00:12:51,024 --> 00:12:52,549
sure to go there tomorrow morning.

130
00:12:52,993 --> 00:12:53,721
Let's drink to that.

131
00:12:54,028 --> 00:12:54,892
Mrs. Rolliver!

132
00:12:55,629 --> 00:12:56,891
Ah there you are my poppet.

133
00:12:57,364 --> 00:12:58,695
We was just on our way.

134
00:13:08,043 --> 00:13:09,032
You are asking me
to go up begging.

135
00:13:09,844 --> 00:13:11,072
Begging? what are you saying?

136
00:13:13,082 --> 00:13:14,413
T'is all in the family

137
00:13:15,584 --> 00:13:18,883
If they was in need, I should
take them in, we all would.

138
00:13:20,022 --> 00:13:22,548
WE all have to take the
ups with the downs, Tess.

139
00:13:23,593 --> 00:13:27,620
now you must go and see her
and ask her for some help in our trouble.

140
00:13:28,532 --> 00:13:29,965
If the lady were to receive me at all.

141
00:13:30,634 --> 00:13:32,159
It would be enough if she were friendly.

142
00:13:33,237 --> 00:13:35,137
you must not expect for her to help us.

143
00:13:35,373 --> 00:13:37,204
oh come come my dear

144
00:13:37,508 --> 00:13:39,305
your pretty face, you could
coax her into anything!

145
00:13:40,646 --> 00:13:42,045
I'd rather try to get work.

146
00:13:44,216 --> 00:13:44,978
Durbeyfield!

147
00:13:46,018 --> 00:13:49,977
You decide. Now if you
say she must go, she'll go.

148
00:13:54,327 --> 00:13:56,989
Now girl, do you want to go to visit kins?

149
00:13:57,897 --> 00:13:59,159
Grandkins, Women-rows?

150
00:13:59,866 --> 00:14:01,391
I'd much sooner not father.

151
00:14:01,635 --> 00:14:02,693
There! she don't want to.

152
00:14:03,304 --> 00:14:06,501
I don't like my children making
themselves spineless kids.

153
00:14:07,775 --> 00:14:10,210
I am the head of the nobliest branch.

154
00:14:11,179 --> 00:14:14,410
And I've got my pride to think of.

155
00:14:19,387 --> 00:14:21,652
All this grobbling about your ancestors.

156
00:14:22,825 --> 00:14:24,952
It isn't them who'll buy us a new horse.

157
00:15:22,457 --> 00:15:23,321
It's all new

158
00:15:56,628 --> 00:15:59,223
WEll my beauty?
What can I do for you?

159
00:16:00,733 --> 00:16:03,258
I... I came to see Mrs. D'Urberville.

160
00:16:03,569 --> 00:16:04,536
I'm afraid that'snot possible.

161
00:16:05,204 --> 00:16:05,966
She's an invalid.

162
00:16:08,308 --> 00:16:09,138
what was your business with her?

163
00:16:09,543 --> 00:16:10,032
I'm her son.

164
00:16:10,577 --> 00:16:13,705
It wasn't business, it was...

165
00:16:15,315 --> 00:16:18,547
I can hardly say what...
not business, sir, no.

166
00:16:19,087 --> 00:16:19,849
Pleasure, then?

167
00:16:20,255 --> 00:16:21,347
No, sir.

168
00:16:22,257 --> 00:16:23,849
T'is all foolish. I...

169
00:16:25,426 --> 00:16:26,723
I fear I can't tell you.

170
00:16:27,196 --> 00:16:29,756
no, no. I like foolish things.

171
00:16:31,634 --> 00:16:32,498
Try again my dear.

172
00:16:34,637 --> 00:16:41,168
I came sir, to tell you that... we
are of the same family as you.

173
00:16:41,544 --> 00:16:44,377
Ah... poor relations?

174
00:16:47,718 --> 00:16:48,377
Stokes?

175
00:16:49,487 --> 00:16:51,648
No... D'Urbervilles, sir.

176
00:16:51,856 --> 00:16:58,888
Now tell me. Do you like strawberries?

177
00:17:00,766 --> 00:17:02,393
Yes, sir. They are in season?

178
00:17:03,201 --> 00:17:04,168
Here they already are.

179
00:17:04,469 --> 00:17:07,496
Our name has become
Durbeyfield but we have several

180
00:17:07,774 --> 00:17:09,036
proofs that we are D'Urbervilles.

181
00:17:10,176 --> 00:17:12,542
That's what the
antiquarians hold that we are.

182
00:17:13,046 --> 00:17:16,312
So our mother said that we should
make ourselves be known to you

183
00:17:17,251 --> 00:17:21,312
say we've lost our horse and
we are the oldest branch of the family.

184
00:17:21,922 --> 00:17:24,516
I see... so

185
00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:28,987
you've gone to pay me a courtesy
call, really, as one relation to another?

186
00:17:29,497 --> 00:17:30,691
Yes, I have.

187
00:17:31,066 --> 00:17:33,830
Yes, well. There's no harm in that.

188
00:17:42,011 --> 00:17:43,876
I would rather take it from my own hand.

189
00:17:45,582 --> 00:17:47,550
Don't be so coy, my pretty cousin.

190
00:17:51,555 --> 00:17:53,420
Look up.

191
00:18:12,778 --> 00:18:14,245
This one too.

192
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:18,647
It's the perfect place.

193
00:18:19,352 --> 00:18:20,080
Believe me.

194
00:18:21,654 --> 00:18:23,053
You'll look a regular bosie.

195
00:18:24,124 --> 00:18:24,853
what's this?

196
00:18:25,059 --> 00:18:25,718
A thorn.

197
00:18:26,026 --> 00:18:29,052
Ah... is it? Beauty has its price...

198
00:18:34,135 --> 00:18:35,125
I'm not very hungry

199
00:18:35,837 --> 00:18:36,735
truly I'm not.

200
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,098
Nonsense.

201
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,601
You must eat
something before you go.

202
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:43,410
It's no near ride from
here to your village.

203
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,391
I shall see what i can do for you.

204
00:18:59,396 --> 00:19:02,695
But listen, Tess, no more of
this D'Urberville nonsense.

205
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,162
Plain Durbeyfield. Understand?

206
00:19:06,805 --> 00:19:07,999
It's quite a different name.

207
00:19:08,873 --> 00:19:10,306
I wish for no better, sir.

208
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,947
In reference to your daughter,
and further to a visit,

209
00:19:18,317 --> 00:19:22,481
we write to inform you of
our willingness to considering

210
00:19:22,822 --> 00:19:27,283
engaging her services in
the managing of a poultry farm

211
00:19:27,794 --> 00:19:29,694
of a modern character.

212
00:19:29,896 --> 00:19:34,197
If after a certain suitable
period your daughter proves

213
00:19:34,635 --> 00:19:40,505
satisfactory we should guarantee
you suitable accomodation and

214
00:19:40,675 --> 00:19:45,409
a good wage. Your earliest reply
would be greatly appreciated.

215
00:19:46,849 --> 00:19:49,841
So, you charmed them
after all, did you?

216
00:19:50,052 --> 00:19:51,212
Let me see, the letter.

217
00:19:52,421 --> 00:19:53,116
Who wrote it?

218
00:19:53,456 --> 00:19:55,981
Who? Mrs. D'Urberville, of course.

219
00:19:56,593 --> 00:19:57,457
below the signature.

220
00:19:58,695 --> 00:20:00,458
Me? Manage a poultry farm?

221
00:20:03,267 --> 00:20:04,791
I truly don't think I shall go.

222
00:20:05,102 --> 00:20:05,796
Poultry.

223
00:20:06,504 --> 00:20:08,665
T'is just her own way of
getting you there without

224
00:20:08,873 --> 00:20:10,898
getting your hopes up too much.

225
00:20:11,876 --> 00:20:13,401
She's going to own you as kin.

226
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:16,880
Ah! You see? This is it!

227
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:20,178
It's the same as ours.

228
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:21,441
Look at it lad.

229
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,680
A ramping great big lion
with a castle on top.

230
00:20:25,525 --> 00:20:26,583
There's no denying it girl.

231
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:29,361
Mrs. D'Urberville recognised
her own flesh and blood.

232
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:30,688
she never even saw me.

233
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:34,662
Well you couldn't expect her
to throw her arms around your neck,

234
00:20:34,935 --> 00:20:36,163
her being an invalid.

235
00:20:36,904 --> 00:20:38,633
But her son made you welcome?

236
00:20:39,206 --> 00:20:40,764
He called you cousin, didn't he?

237
00:20:43,011 --> 00:20:44,273
I'd rather stay here with you.

238
00:21:07,771 --> 00:21:08,499
Bye, father.

239
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,469
You are off then?

240
00:21:11,776 --> 00:21:13,835
Yes. Goodbye, father.

241
00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:15,475
Goodbye girl.

242
00:21:16,948 --> 00:21:18,438
You are a comely site.

243
00:21:19,817 --> 00:21:21,012
This young cousin of yours.

244
00:21:22,588 --> 00:21:25,284
Tell him, being so come down in the world.

245
00:21:26,692 --> 00:21:28,125
I would sell him the title.

246
00:21:29,294 --> 00:21:31,627
Yes, I'll sell it. At a fair price.

247
00:21:32,098 --> 00:21:34,532
Not less than a thousand pounds.

248
00:21:34,734 --> 00:21:37,066
That's right tell him that
I'll take the thousand pounds.

249
00:21:39,706 --> 00:21:41,004
WEll now I come to think of it,

250
00:21:42,409 --> 00:21:44,877
He can have it for a hundred.
I won't stand on trifles.

251
00:21:47,815 --> 00:21:51,980
Fifty. Twenty pounds, tell him
and not a penny less.

252
00:21:53,688 --> 00:21:55,087
Family honour.It's family honour.

253
00:21:55,557 --> 00:21:56,683
Now it's time to go.

254
00:21:58,193 --> 00:21:59,785
I want to walk a little way with Tess.

255
00:22:00,096 --> 00:22:03,156
So do i, now she's leaving
to marry our gentlemen cousin.

256
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:04,633
I'll hear no more of that.

257
00:22:05,635 --> 00:22:07,967
Mother.How could you have put
such nonsense into their heads?

258
00:22:08,504 --> 00:22:11,030
she's going to work for
a rich relation, my dears.

259
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:13,741
And help us earn enough
money to get us a new horse.

260
00:22:25,056 --> 00:22:25,681
Oh mother.

261
00:22:25,957 --> 00:22:27,982
I wish our Tess isn't going to be a lady.

262
00:22:51,652 --> 00:22:53,813
Don't hold my arm.
Grab me around the waist.

263
00:23:06,068 --> 00:23:07,126
Ungrateful little minx.

264
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,635
Why abandon me as
soon as you feel safe?

265
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:11,431
The danger came
from your foolishness.

266
00:23:11,808 --> 00:23:13,503
I say what a temper.

267
00:23:14,577 --> 00:23:15,976
When people are on top of the hill,

268
00:23:16,179 --> 00:23:17,339
they have to get down somehow.

269
00:23:17,547 --> 00:23:18,572
But never a gallop, surely.

270
00:23:19,116 --> 00:23:21,550
Fancy being asked that by
a brave little beauty like you.

271
00:23:22,653 --> 00:23:24,143
I always go downhill at a gallop.

272
00:23:25,456 --> 00:23:26,980
You can't beat it for stirring the blood.

273
00:23:27,725 --> 00:23:29,626
But perhaps you needn't feel so, again.

274
00:23:30,261 --> 00:23:31,489
Perhaps not.

275
00:23:32,497 --> 00:23:36,194
All depends. One little kiss
on those ruby lips

276
00:23:36,968 --> 00:23:40,461
or even on that satin cheek
and I'd drive at a snail's pace.

277
00:23:40,639 --> 00:23:41,264
Either one.

278
00:23:41,474 --> 00:23:42,805
But they don't want to be kissed, sir.

279
00:23:48,448 --> 00:23:49,745
Stop, stop.
Wait. I beg you.

280
00:23:51,451 --> 00:23:54,215
Very well. Do as you wish.I don't mind.

281
00:23:55,388 --> 00:23:57,721
But I thought you'd protect me being a kinsman.

282
00:24:00,695 --> 00:24:01,627
Kinsman be hanged.

283
00:24:07,301 --> 00:24:09,133
You are mighty sensitive for a village lass.

284
00:24:21,217 --> 00:24:21,842
Oh my hat.

285
00:24:33,397 --> 00:24:34,830
You look even prettier without it.

286
00:24:45,677 --> 00:24:46,804
Come along now. Up you go.

287
00:24:47,079 --> 00:24:47,738
No sir.

288
00:24:48,281 --> 00:24:49,009
You mind my driving?

289
00:24:49,382 --> 00:24:50,371
No sir. I shall walk.

290
00:24:50,716 --> 00:24:52,843
But it's four miles to Trantridge, at least.

291
00:24:53,219 --> 00:24:55,153
Well I wouldn't care if it were twenty.

292
00:25:05,632 --> 00:25:07,191
You watch out for Dollop, the bailiff.

293
00:25:07,669 --> 00:25:08,499
He's a devil.Not Mr Alec.

294
00:25:10,104 --> 00:25:14,666
Spends half the time on horseback and
rest of it chasing the nights with us.

295
00:25:17,079 --> 00:25:19,479
Heard his mother's a queer
old soul but no real trouble.

296
00:25:20,282 --> 00:25:21,772
T'is mercy for us she's blind.

297
00:25:24,153 --> 00:25:25,415
Mrs. D'Urberville's blind?

298
00:25:25,889 --> 00:25:26,514
Stone blind.

299
00:25:28,725 --> 00:25:29,817
Their real name is Stokes.

300
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:34,189
Who's that?

301
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:36,262
Mr Alec's father had the notion.

302
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:38,993
He bought the name of
an old extinguished family

303
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:40,603
to make himself look important.

304
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:41,970
Whatever are you doing?

305
00:25:42,139 --> 00:25:43,470
Missus is waiting for her birds?

306
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,677
Oh quick, quick,
it's slipped my mind entirely.

307
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,409
Now you catch the Phena there.

308
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:48,978
And that one!

309
00:26:13,407 --> 00:26:14,966
It's that one there and the white one.

310
00:26:40,671 --> 00:26:42,195
So you are the new young woman?

311
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:46,039
Well? How are my birds?

312
00:26:59,591 --> 00:27:00,489
This is Strut.

313
00:27:03,495 --> 00:27:06,192
Doesn't seem so
lively today, does he?

314
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:11,293
He's alarmed being handled
by strangers I suppose.

315
00:27:12,939 --> 00:27:19,846
And Phena? Ah... yes yes...

316
00:27:20,748 --> 00:27:24,207
They are a little too frightened,
aren't you, my poor dears?

317
00:27:25,787 --> 00:27:28,312
Never mind.They'll soon get used to you.

318
00:27:29,257 --> 00:27:29,916
Can you whistle?

319
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,688
Whistle Ma'am?

320
00:27:33,329 --> 00:27:35,661
Yes. Whistle tunes!

321
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:37,862
A little.

322
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,995
Then you will have
to practice every day.

323
00:27:40,737 --> 00:27:44,333
I think a lot of my fowls but there are also
my bullfinches which you have to consider.

324
00:27:44,675 --> 00:27:47,439
I had a young lad who whistled
to them very well but he left.

325
00:27:48,512 --> 00:27:49,740
They've been neglected for days.

326
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,838
Master Alec whistled to
them this morning Ma'am.

327
00:27:53,218 --> 00:27:53,980
Oh... him...

328
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:20,478
No art, no nature ever created
a lovelier thing than you, cousin Tess.

329
00:28:21,848 --> 00:28:25,512
To see that pretty mouth
pouting and puffing away without

330
00:28:25,953 --> 00:28:27,420
producing a single note.

331
00:28:28,122 --> 00:28:29,487
T'is all a part of my work, sir.

332
00:28:30,258 --> 00:28:31,282
Well, never mind. I'll teach you.

333
00:28:32,394 --> 00:28:33,622
I won't lay a finger on you.

334
00:28:34,096 --> 00:28:35,723
See? I'll stay exactly where I am.

335
00:28:37,032 --> 00:28:41,492
Now you watch me.
Don't scrap your lips too tight.

336
00:28:42,572 --> 00:28:43,266
Do it like this.

337
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:56,311
Blow gently.... gently.

338
00:28:57,922 --> 00:28:59,787
Try.

339
00:29:03,361 --> 00:29:04,623
No... no... try again.

340
00:29:08,967 --> 00:29:09,729
Again.

341
00:29:13,372 --> 00:29:16,773
There . You'll manage
splendidly now I've started you off.

342
00:29:19,378 --> 00:29:22,837
Tell me Tess. Didn't you
find my mother a little... odd?

343
00:29:24,885 --> 00:29:26,147
Why. I hardly know her sir.

344
00:29:27,821 --> 00:29:29,413
WEll I'm not in her good
books at the moment.

345
00:29:30,825 --> 00:29:33,157
But you should find her favour
if you treat her livestocks well.

346
00:29:39,734 --> 00:29:45,833
So... if you meet to any difficulties...
don't go to Dollop, come to me.

347
00:29:47,676 --> 00:29:48,540
Au revoir.

348
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,825
Don't you fancy a dance then?

349
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:09,323
I'm all tired. When are
you all going home?

350
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:11,768
Soon enough, soon enough.

351
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:21,068
WEll, my beauty. What are you doing
here at this time of the night?

352
00:31:21,647 --> 00:31:22,875
I'm waiting for the others sir.

353
00:31:23,415 --> 00:31:25,508
Not being acquainted with the road home.

354
00:31:25,718 --> 00:31:27,049
I only have a saddle horse, I'm afraid.

355
00:31:27,253 --> 00:31:29,279
Come along to the inn with me.
I'll hire a trap for us both.

356
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:32,756
Thank you but I promised to wait for them.

357
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:38,122
Very well. Ca m'est egal. Please yourself.

358
00:32:01,624 --> 00:32:03,319
What's that creeping down your back?

359
00:32:07,765 --> 00:32:11,496
WEll I declare... it's treacle.

360
00:32:36,563 --> 00:32:38,690
You dare laugh at me, you hussie.

361
00:32:38,865 --> 00:32:40,628
I can't help it.No more than the others.

362
00:32:41,768 --> 00:32:44,328
Oh, you think you are the
queen of Trantridge, dont' you?

363
00:32:44,571 --> 00:32:45,970
Just because your first favourite with him.

364
00:32:47,842 --> 00:32:49,070
She never said anything.
Leave her.

365
00:32:49,644 --> 00:32:52,511
I've worked two years
for your heirs and graces.

366
00:32:52,814 --> 00:32:55,977
If I'd known what sort you were,
I never would have lowered

367
00:32:56,251 --> 00:32:57,843
myself by sticking to your company.

368
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,184
I'll show you.

369
00:32:59,388 --> 00:33:03,654
Hey there, work-folk.
What's all the row about?

370
00:33:06,329 --> 00:33:07,455
Quickly, jump up beside me.

371
00:33:21,312 --> 00:33:24,042
Out of the frying pan, into the fire!

372
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:38,658
Where are we?

373
00:33:39,298 --> 00:33:40,287
Passing through the chase.

374
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,101
Chase? T'is out of our way surely?

375
00:33:45,706 --> 00:33:48,539
This forest is one the oldest
and the loveliest in England, Tess.

376
00:33:49,476 --> 00:33:51,774
Don't you think it is asked
to be seen on a glorious,

377
00:33:52,012 --> 00:33:53,138
god-given night like this?

378
00:33:54,081 --> 00:33:54,946
Yes ... but

379
00:33:55,617 --> 00:33:56,174
No buts.

380
00:33:56,718 --> 00:33:57,377
There's a good girl.

381
00:33:59,087 --> 00:34:01,419
I'll be honest with you. I'm happy.

382
00:34:02,157 --> 00:34:03,556
I'm trying to prolong the moment.

383
00:34:06,529 --> 00:34:07,553
You were shivering a while back.

384
00:34:08,597 --> 00:34:10,189
Now I can feel your warmth against me.

385
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:11,962
Are you still cold?

386
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:14,060
No. Not now.

387
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:17,704
I'll let my animal walk in a bit further.

388
00:34:18,742 --> 00:34:20,471
He'll make better progress once he's rested.

389
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,143
Tell me. What feels of your parent's horse?

390
00:34:27,018 --> 00:34:27,814
They have no horse.

391
00:34:28,352 --> 00:34:30,843
They have. Since... monday last.

392
00:34:31,823 --> 00:34:32,983
Did you?

393
00:34:33,291 --> 00:34:34,759
Forgive me for having mentioned it.

394
00:34:35,127 --> 00:34:36,094
I thought that they would have written to you.

395
00:34:39,264 --> 00:34:40,253
I don't know what to say.

396
00:34:41,166 --> 00:34:44,625
It's nothing. I knew how
important it was for your

397
00:34:44,804 --> 00:34:45,828
father to have a new horse.

398
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,741
Really. It's you, he should thank.

399
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:54,670
I'm grateful to you, truly I am. But...

400
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:58,515
I almost wish you hadn't done this.

401
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:01,214
Yes, I almost do.

402
00:35:02,223 --> 00:35:03,019
Is that a reproach?

403
00:35:03,525 --> 00:35:04,219
Oh no.

404
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,855
T'is very kind of you, I'm sure.

405
00:35:09,431 --> 00:35:11,729
I've been in torment since you came to us.

406
00:35:15,505 --> 00:35:17,029
Then I'll leave tomorrow sir.

407
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,801
That is absurd. I don't want you to leave.

408
00:35:22,211 --> 00:35:23,577
That's the last thing I want.

409
00:35:26,416 --> 00:35:30,045
Is there no hope for me? None at all?

410
00:35:32,256 --> 00:35:37,957
Oh, Tess. I'm dying for you. Can't you see?

411
00:35:57,150 --> 00:36:00,745
Forgive me. Oh please, forgive me.

412
00:36:01,588 --> 00:36:02,248
Are you hurt?

413
00:36:02,523 --> 00:36:03,854
No. It's nothing.

414
00:36:06,127 --> 00:36:06,821
You are bleeding!

415
00:36:12,901 --> 00:36:13,959
Oh my god...

416
00:36:15,804 --> 00:36:17,328
how could I have done such a thing?

417
00:39:16,803 --> 00:39:17,861
It's me...

418
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:22,538
Don't be so foolish... open the door.

419
00:39:27,381 --> 00:39:29,043
You'll force me to make a noise, Tess.

420
00:39:30,519 --> 00:39:33,147
My mother has sharp ears. She'll hear!

421
00:39:37,659 --> 00:39:39,753
Enough of this nonsense, darling.

422
00:39:40,196 --> 00:39:41,060
Open up!

423
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:13,660
Why sneak away? Like a thief?

424
00:40:15,067 --> 00:40:16,227
And at this hour in the morning?

425
00:40:18,104 --> 00:40:19,799
nobody would have prevented you from leaving.

426
00:40:22,809 --> 00:40:23,901
At least let me drive you home.

427
00:40:31,285 --> 00:40:32,377
Unless you'd care to come back.

428
00:40:33,454 --> 00:40:34,284
I shan't come back.

429
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:03,718
What are you crying for?

430
00:41:04,855 --> 00:41:05,948
I was only thinking.

431
00:41:07,392 --> 00:41:08,484
I was born over there.

432
00:41:10,395 --> 00:41:12,920
Well, we all have to be born somewhere.

433
00:41:14,165 --> 00:41:19,126
I... I wish I'd never been born. There or anywhere else.

434
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:23,707
You are absurdly melancoly, Tess. You can hold your

435
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:26,209
own for beauty against anyone. Queen or common.

436
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,207
I tell you that as a practical man who wishes you well.

437
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:33,818
If you are wise, you'll let the world get a clearer site

438
00:41:34,087 --> 00:41:38,491
of that beauty. Before it fades. Why not make the most

439
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:42,696
of life? WE didn't fare so badly together, did we?

440
00:41:43,264 --> 00:41:44,959
I was blinded for a while, that's all.

441
00:41:45,234 --> 00:41:46,223
That's what all women say.

442
00:41:47,169 --> 00:41:49,069
How dare you talk like that?

443
00:41:49,905 --> 00:41:51,668
Has it never struck you that what all women say,

444
00:41:51,907 --> 00:41:52,805
some women may feel?

445
00:41:53,042 --> 00:41:55,068
All right, all right. I was wrong.I admit it.

446
00:41:55,278 --> 00:41:56,210
Please, please, stop.

447
00:41:56,446 --> 00:41:57,310
I should like to get down here.

448
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:09,826
I'm a bad lot I suppose. A damn bad lot.

449
00:42:10,428 --> 00:42:13,488
I was born bad and I'll warrant that I'll die bad.

450
00:42:16,101 --> 00:42:19,502
Listen, Tess. If circumstances should arise,

451
00:42:19,771 --> 00:42:22,706
you understand, if you are ever in the least trouble,

452
00:42:22,975 --> 00:42:26,776
least difficulty, just send me one line and you

453
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:29,972
shall have whatever you need, by return.

454
00:42:35,089 --> 00:42:35,953
You really won't come back?

455
00:42:43,865 --> 00:42:48,564
Goodbye my four months cousin, goodbye.

456
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:57,943
Tess!

457
00:45:45,866 --> 00:45:47,993
T'is no use of her pretending she hates it.

458
00:45:48,736 --> 00:45:51,899
And wishes it in the churchyard and herself besides it.

459
00:45:52,506 --> 00:45:53,905
She loves that child of hers.

460
00:45:54,241 --> 00:45:57,233
Poor little mite. He don't look right for this world.

461
00:46:25,239 --> 00:46:26,001
Good evening, Durbeyfield.

462
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:27,265
What's your business?

463
00:46:28,275 --> 00:46:31,142
My business? Whatelse but the child?

464
00:46:31,812 --> 00:46:34,178
I've to baptise it before lord gathers it to his bosom.

465
00:46:34,415 --> 00:46:35,541
What child are you speaking of?

466
00:46:36,049 --> 00:46:38,040
All my children are baptised. You all know.

467
00:46:38,552 --> 00:46:40,713
Durbeyfield. Don't play games with your mighty.

468
00:46:40,921 --> 00:46:44,789
I don't play sir. I work! I work! Like a beast of a field.

469
00:46:45,292 --> 00:46:46,691
You can tell the almighty that for me!

470
00:46:49,930 --> 00:46:50,760
The baby's dying!

471
00:46:50,964 --> 00:46:51,862
You ought to have been more careful.

472
00:46:52,399 --> 00:46:55,926
Like it or not Jack that
child was born this year!

473
00:46:57,204 --> 00:46:57,966
Not true.

474
00:46:58,338 --> 00:47:00,966
Come to your senses!
For pities sake, let the vicar in!

475
00:47:01,742 --> 00:47:04,438
He shan't set foot in this house!
Not over my dead body!

476
00:47:07,347 --> 00:47:09,008
There's enough disgrace
on my name as it is!

477
00:47:12,119 --> 00:47:13,518
The works of god have pity.
Have pity on him.

478
00:47:14,521 --> 00:47:20,949
Send all your anger on me and
put all your mercy on my child.

479
00:47:22,329 --> 00:47:23,387
My child!

480
00:47:48,542 --> 00:47:50,170
I should like to ask you something sir.

481
00:47:51,814 --> 00:47:53,340
Well speak girl, I'm listening.

482
00:48:00,531 --> 00:48:02,967
Each of us share in your sad affliction, my child.

483
00:48:03,837 --> 00:48:06,272
We are all members of the suffering body of christ.

484
00:48:06,909 --> 00:48:07,877
My son was baptised.

485
00:48:09,045 --> 00:48:10,571
Baptised? By whom?

486
00:48:11,818 --> 00:48:13,582
By me... last night.

487
00:48:14,689 --> 00:48:16,590
What procedure did you follow?

488
00:48:19,731 --> 00:48:23,602
I woke my little brothers and sisters.
Made them kneel down to

489
00:48:24,106 --> 00:48:31,108
pray. Lazaru, hold a prayer
book open, I lit a candle.

490
00:48:31,887 --> 00:48:32,478
And then?

491
00:48:34,525 --> 00:48:38,897
And I hold my child like this, over the basin.

492
00:48:39,868 --> 00:48:40,630
Yes?

493
00:48:41,404 --> 00:48:43,931
Poured some water over
his forehead. And I said,

494
00:48:45,078 --> 00:48:48,140
Ibaptise thee, in the name of the Father,

495
00:48:49,018 --> 00:48:50,384
the Son and Holy Ghost.

496
00:48:52,056 --> 00:48:54,219
Did you make the sign of the cross?

497
00:48:54,828 --> 00:48:56,387
Yes, I did that too.

498
00:48:58,334 --> 00:49:01,829
It was allthe just the same
as if you'd baptised him.

499
00:49:01,941 --> 00:49:03,740
In the sight of god, I mean.

500
00:49:04,245 --> 00:49:06,238
Yes, my dear girl. It will be the same.

501
00:49:07,385 --> 00:49:09,081
Can you give him a christian burial?

502
00:49:10,123 --> 00:49:12,285
That's another matter.

503
00:49:13,595 --> 00:49:15,588
Another matter? Why?

504
00:49:16,066 --> 00:49:17,933
That would concern
village as a home,

505
00:49:18,671 --> 00:49:21,141
not just the two of us,
you understand.

506
00:49:22,712 --> 00:49:25,946
Would you do it sir?
Just this once?

507
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:27,845
I'm sorry.

508
00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:30,883
I beg you! Please.

509
00:49:32,429 --> 00:49:34,797
I told you. It's out of question.

510
00:49:38,406 --> 00:49:39,465
Then I don't like you.

511
00:49:41,244 --> 00:49:43,374
I shall never come
to your church again

512
00:49:44,117 --> 00:49:46,053
Never! Never!

513
00:52:09,946 --> 00:52:11,380
Mr Crick!

514
00:52:16,424 --> 00:52:17,392
You here already?

515
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:18,826
We didn't expect you
till before tomorrow.

516
00:52:20,431 --> 00:52:22,230
Just a step away from
here to Weatherbury.

517
00:52:22,636 --> 00:52:24,332
Marlott sir. I come from Marlott.

518
00:52:25,007 --> 00:52:27,341
That's even further.

519
00:52:29,681 --> 00:52:31,014
Quite sure that you can stand it here?

520
00:52:31,786 --> 00:52:33,584
T'is comfortable enough for rough folks.

521
00:52:33,789 --> 00:52:36,693
But we don't live in a co-cumber frame.

522
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:40,961
I'm accustomed to that.

523
00:52:41,503 --> 00:52:43,598
I used to know your part of
the country when I were a lad.

524
00:52:45,143 --> 00:52:46,168
Good... right char...

525
00:52:46,512 --> 00:52:48,573
Well you'll want a rest and a muscle of food.

526
00:52:48,916 --> 00:52:50,852
I'd rather begin now. To get my hand in.

527
00:52:51,255 --> 00:52:53,156
Ohh... come on... you must be famished.

528
00:52:53,558 --> 00:52:55,528
No, Thank you. A little milk will suffice.

529
00:52:56,931 --> 00:53:02,464
Oh well. If you prefer that... so be it.

530
00:53:05,714 --> 00:53:07,410
Just what I hate. Haven't touched it for years.

531
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:14,226
Lies in my inwards like lead.

532
00:53:25,148 --> 00:53:26,947
My thinking, we aren't getting all we should.

533
00:53:27,853 --> 00:53:30,085
That's because there's
a new hand come among us.

534
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:31,588
I know it's happened before.

535
00:53:32,228 --> 00:53:36,566
They do say that the milk, goes
up into their horns at such times.

536
00:53:38,773 --> 00:53:40,743
Anyone would think we
were back in the Middle Ages.

537
00:53:43,915 --> 00:53:45,383
I don't think we are making any progress.

538
00:53:46,988 --> 00:53:49,481
Keep it gentle. keep it gentle, sir.

539
00:53:50,293 --> 00:53:52,058
It's the skill that does it, not your strength.

540
00:53:52,330 --> 00:53:54,095
So my aching fingers tell me...

541
00:54:12,567 --> 00:54:14,902
Mrs. Crick is far too proud to
come a-milking with us and that's a fact.

542
00:54:17,042 --> 00:54:21,278
Still, there's little enough worried
about.WE eat like game carts.

543
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:27,022
Know you'll like it here.
Mr Crick, he's a very kindly man.

544
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:32,597
Just fancy. he has his
own family pew in church.

545
00:54:34,607 --> 00:54:40,278
Dairyman on the deck all the weeks
and on Sundays - Mr Richard Crick.

546
00:55:01,322 --> 00:55:02,220
Who's that playing?

547
00:55:04,127 --> 00:55:04,924
Mr. Clare?

548
00:55:07,465 --> 00:55:08,490
Mr Clare.

549
00:55:10,838 --> 00:55:12,170
Him that's learning to milk.

550
00:55:13,843 --> 00:55:24,456
Angel Clare, he's called. Angel, t'is no common name.

551
00:55:27,769 --> 00:55:30,604
He never says much to us. For is the pity.

552
00:55:31,810 --> 00:55:35,647
Why? Does he scorn on common folk?

553
00:55:36,719 --> 00:55:37,709
Quite the opposite.

554
00:55:38,656 --> 00:55:41,388
He often makes mock of the old families.

555
00:55:42,963 --> 00:55:44,295
It's quite simple.

556
00:55:46,103 --> 00:55:50,406
He's a parson's son with a mind to be a farmer.

557
00:55:52,413 --> 00:55:55,908
He's already tried his hand at the sheep-farming

558
00:55:57,656 --> 00:56:00,652
and now he's learning dairy work with Mr Crick.

559
00:56:03,601 --> 00:56:06,731
What does he hold against the old families?

560
00:56:09,444 --> 00:56:14,385
He says that they are... they are war....

561
00:56:16,056 --> 00:56:17,024
war mutants.

562
00:58:14,837 --> 00:58:16,966
It's half of your soul trying to escape.

563
00:58:17,208 --> 00:58:18,608
it's bread that's all.

564
00:58:20,213 --> 00:58:23,446
No! Helping you sneeze, you are like the role you

565
00:58:23,819 --> 00:58:24,650
throw away.

566
00:58:25,323 --> 00:58:29,057
As I see it, no soul can be
mortally shared before he dies.

567
00:58:29,697 --> 00:58:31,724
What if a man falls down in a faint.?

568
00:58:32,101 --> 00:58:33,763
Well that's a different matter.

569
00:58:36,742 --> 00:58:41,240
The spirit lives on there inside
you but you can not feel it.

570
00:58:42,887 --> 00:58:45,757
We can sometimes make
our souls leave our bodies.

571
00:58:49,866 --> 00:58:50,834
How's that then Mickey?

572
00:58:53,907 --> 00:58:56,469
Only have to lie by some grass at night and

573
00:58:56,746 --> 00:58:58,112
stare up at some great stars.

574
00:59:00,151 --> 00:59:02,917
And stare at it with all your might.

575
00:59:04,125 --> 00:59:07,792
And by and by you feel you are falling into the sky.

576
00:59:09,002 --> 00:59:14,945
Miles and miles from your body which
you con't seem to need at all.

577
01:00:07,506 --> 01:00:11,002
Tess! Why run away like that?

578
01:00:14,486 --> 01:00:15,351
Are you afraid?

579
01:00:16,623 --> 01:00:17,420
No sir.

580
01:00:17,959 --> 01:00:19,359
Not of outdoor things. No.

581
01:00:19,561 --> 01:00:21,189
But you have your indoor fears. Aye?

582
01:00:26,741 --> 01:00:27,867
But I couldn't really say.

583
01:00:28,077 --> 01:00:29,066
But the milk turning sour?

584
01:00:30,114 --> 01:00:30,911
No

585
01:00:31,750 --> 01:00:32,877
Fear of life in general.

586
01:00:33,821 --> 01:00:35,653
Yes,

587
01:00:36,926 --> 01:00:41,424
So have I. Very often. Life's a puzzle. Don't you think?

588
01:00:44,206 --> 01:00:47,541
Perhaps. now you put it that way.

589
01:01:01,804 --> 01:01:04,070
It takes no use.
It won't take it.

590
01:01:05,711 --> 01:01:09,548
Visit the I shall have to
call on conjuror Trentle.

591
01:01:10,687 --> 01:01:11,849
I don't say I believe in my

592
01:01:12,757 --> 01:01:15,284
but if nothing else works I shall have to try at chance.

593
01:01:15,763 --> 01:01:17,322
Somebody here's in love, i'll be bound.

594
01:01:17,766 --> 01:01:19,325
That can cause its white curd.

595
01:01:19,603 --> 01:01:20,434
Conjuror Paul.

596
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:24,834
He didn't have the knack of it when I was a lad.

597
01:01:25,847 --> 01:01:28,944
It's a pity. He must be
feeding the worms by now.

598
01:01:29,153 --> 01:01:31,179
My grandpa used to go
to Conjuror Minturm

599
01:01:31,591 --> 01:01:35,291
Hunted owls for him.There's
no folk like him these days.

600
01:01:35,866 --> 01:01:37,129
Somebody's in love I tell you.

601
01:01:40,407 --> 01:01:41,033
What's the matter?

602
01:01:41,276 --> 01:01:42,767
The blasted butter won't come.

603
01:01:43,445 --> 01:01:44,037
Why's that?

604
01:01:44,447 --> 01:01:45,005
To my mind...

605
01:01:45,249 --> 01:01:46,683
How warm it is today.

606
01:01:49,089 --> 01:01:51,719
I think... I better be out of doors.

607
01:02:21,147 --> 01:02:22,012
Don't push.

608
01:02:28,761 --> 01:02:30,059
He looks so sad.

609
01:02:34,070 --> 01:02:35,539
What can he be thinking of?

610
01:02:36,843 --> 01:02:39,313
Not of us. You can rely on that.

611
01:02:44,857 --> 01:02:46,951
You are fine one to talk, lzz.

612
01:02:47,762 --> 01:02:48,457
I saw you.

613
01:02:49,297 --> 01:02:49,957
What did you see?

614
01:02:51,668 --> 01:02:55,733
Just the other day.I saw
you kissing his shadow.

615
01:03:01,453 --> 01:03:02,819
O... Here he comes again.

616
01:03:04,759 --> 01:03:15,007
Dear eyes.Dear his face.
Dear Mr Clare.

617
01:03:18,050 --> 01:03:21,078
It's terrible that he doesn't
want to wed any one of us.

618
01:03:24,093 --> 01:03:27,429
Or likely that he'll ask us to milk
his cows for so much in years.

619
01:03:47,236 --> 01:03:48,295
What are we going to do?

620
01:03:48,838 --> 01:03:50,431
We shall have to take the Stonebridge road.

621
01:03:50,675 --> 01:03:51,471
WE'll be late.

622
01:04:23,267 --> 01:04:24,200
Do he go to church?

623
01:04:24,836 --> 01:04:26,567
No no... never.

624
01:04:27,641 --> 01:04:28,506
Wish he would.

625
01:04:33,485 --> 01:04:35,249
You look like cats afraid of water.

626
01:04:35,756 --> 01:04:37,748
Only on account of
our Sunday bests sir.

627
01:04:38,494 --> 01:04:40,464
Very well. I'll carry you just as you are.

628
01:04:41,233 --> 01:04:43,134
No, no, I'm far too heavy.

629
01:04:43,805 --> 01:04:46,104
Nonsense, I could carry
all four of you at once.

630
01:04:46,476 --> 01:04:47,774
Hold on to me. That's it.

631
01:05:01,303 --> 01:05:04,365
I should put my arms around
his neck and look into his eyes.

632
01:05:05,744 --> 01:05:06,803
There's nothing in that.

633
01:05:08,048 --> 01:05:09,641
There's time for everything under heaven.

634
01:05:10,319 --> 01:05:12,015
Time to kiss and a time to cuddle.

635
01:05:13,424 --> 01:05:15,587
Shame on you lzz.It's a scripture!

636
01:05:15,828 --> 01:05:17,797
I always read the prettiest verses in church.

637
01:06:07,288 --> 01:06:09,621
If you help me, perhaps I could climb along the bank.

638
01:06:13,967 --> 01:06:18,532
Oh Tess. I've gone to three courses
of this trouble Only for your sake alone.

639
01:07:53,313 --> 01:07:54,211
She's angry.

640
01:07:54,782 --> 01:07:57,082
She doesn't understand and
she'll kick away her bucket.

641
01:07:57,453 --> 01:07:58,682
Forgive me my darling Tess.

642
01:07:58,889 --> 01:07:59,754
I don't know what came over me.

643
01:08:01,927 --> 01:08:02,952
There's only one excuse for it.

644
01:08:04,498 --> 01:08:05,397
I love you.

645
01:08:07,872 --> 01:08:09,864
I love you.

646
01:08:29,978 --> 01:08:30,604
Angel!

647
01:08:31,348 --> 01:08:32,212
Angel!

648
01:08:32,951 --> 01:08:33,645
Hello Mercy!

649
01:08:34,353 --> 01:08:35,378
Forgive me I didn't see you.

650
01:08:36,356 --> 01:08:36,948
Forgive me.

651
01:08:38,460 --> 01:08:39,119
Welcome home.

652
01:08:39,929 --> 01:08:40,395
How are you?

653
01:08:40,931 --> 01:08:42,194
Very well.God be praised.

654
01:08:42,968 --> 01:08:44,493
You look radiant with health I see.

655
01:08:44,972 --> 01:08:45,836
The open air probably.

656
01:08:46,174 --> 01:08:49,077
Have you come to spend
the holidays with your brothers?

657
01:08:49,379 --> 01:08:50,871
Are they here? I had no idea.

658
01:08:51,418 --> 01:08:54,856
No. I'm only paying my parents
a brief visit to settle some urgent business.

659
01:08:55,191 --> 01:08:56,123
Oh. Then I won't detain you.

660
01:08:56,994 --> 01:08:59,088
I have my bible class
to take in any case.

661
01:09:01,201 --> 01:09:01,964
Au revoir Angel.

662
01:09:02,870 --> 01:09:03,530
Au revoir.

663
01:09:24,643 --> 01:09:26,373
Angel! My boy.

664
01:09:28,817 --> 01:09:31,584
I'm apologise father.
I had no time to warn you of my arrival.

665
01:09:31,923 --> 01:09:32,948
Actually forgotten how to write?

666
01:09:33,392 --> 01:09:34,451
With a pen. Remember?

667
01:09:34,996 --> 01:09:36,555
I brought you some
common house delicadies.

668
01:09:37,266 --> 01:09:39,668
Black Puddings and
a bottle of mead.

669
01:09:40,004 --> 01:09:40,801
Black Pudding...

670
01:09:41,908 --> 01:09:45,506
It's true. Your mother and
I have regretted hearing so little

671
01:09:45,748 --> 01:09:46,476
of your news.

672
01:09:47,050 --> 01:09:48,245
Why fare with him father?

673
01:09:48,686 --> 01:09:50,518
If anyone wants time
with sheep and cattle,

674
01:09:50,857 --> 01:09:53,350
if we are closer to nature...
Father, notsworth.

675
01:09:54,664 --> 01:09:57,100
I'd like to remind you, Felix,
that university education

676
01:09:57,335 --> 01:10:00,671
means nothing. Unless it
goes down to the glory of god.

677
01:10:01,376 --> 01:10:02,902
It could also go down to the glory of land.

678
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:04,841
It can be in the second place.

679
01:10:06,218 --> 01:10:07,709
Howfar have you got
with your apprenticeship?

680
01:10:07,954 --> 01:10:09,149
It's drawing to a close.

681
01:10:13,399 --> 01:10:16,063
What counts is spiritual cleaness.
Isn't that true, Father?

682
01:10:16,370 --> 01:10:17,303
Too good together, my boy.

683
01:10:18,942 --> 01:10:21,104
Father tell us that you intend
setting up your own account.

684
01:10:21,346 --> 01:10:23,212
In what part of the world?

685
01:10:23,482 --> 01:10:25,884
I don't know yet. In the colonnist perhaps?

686
01:10:27,189 --> 01:10:28,122
Heaven preserve us.

687
01:10:29,092 --> 01:10:30,857
It could suit the type
of forming I have in mind.

688
01:10:31,730 --> 01:10:32,561
what colony?

689
01:10:32,899 --> 01:10:35,530
The choice is wide.
Or I may settle in a foreign country.

690
01:10:36,006 --> 01:10:37,838
Some places offer lands
to immigrants on very

691
01:10:38,076 --> 01:10:40,546
favourable terms. Brazil for example.

692
01:10:41,882 --> 01:10:43,009
One knows you will never see us.

693
01:10:45,656 --> 01:10:48,092
Nothings settled yet.
I came here to discuss it.

694
01:10:48,661 --> 01:10:51,689
That among the other things.
Shall we take a drop of good

695
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:53,334
Mrs Crick's delicious mead?

696
01:10:57,211 --> 01:10:58,543
Oh forgive me . I forgot.

697
01:10:59,114 --> 01:11:00,878
Strong drink is the root of all evil.

698
01:11:11,201 --> 01:11:12,294
Take us into your confidence.

699
01:11:12,871 --> 01:11:13,896
Is it something serious?

700
01:11:14,675 --> 01:11:18,410
Not serious, but something
important. The truth is

701
01:11:20,419 --> 01:11:22,446
son't you think it's time
i considered marrying?

702
01:11:23,257 --> 01:11:25,227
Yes indeed my boy, yes indeed.

703
01:11:25,528 --> 01:11:27,657
Your mother and I have sometimes
debated the same question.

704
01:11:27,932 --> 01:11:28,626
Really?

705
01:11:29,034 --> 01:11:30,058
And what sort of wife would you favour

706
01:11:30,470 --> 01:11:32,200
for a budding farmer like myself?

707
01:11:32,506 --> 01:11:34,373
Truly christian, god-fearing woman.

708
01:11:34,677 --> 01:11:37,649
One who will be of help and
a comfort to you in all things.

709
01:11:38,151 --> 01:11:39,209
The rest matters little.

710
01:11:39,454 --> 01:11:41,082
You musn't hesitate, dear son.

711
01:11:42,225 --> 01:11:42,953
Why hesitate?

712
01:11:43,494 --> 01:11:46,124
To marry your heart's desire.
Mercy Chant.

713
01:11:47,601 --> 01:11:50,766
She may be fond of over-
decorating the church and

714
01:11:51,207 --> 01:11:53,803
flipparies and flowers,
scraps of lacys and so forth but

715
01:11:54,780 --> 01:11:56,682
It's merely a girl's fancies. It will pass.

716
01:11:57,419 --> 01:11:59,286
Mercy's a pure and virtuous girl.

717
01:11:59,556 --> 01:12:01,525
Oh yes I know she's pure and virtuous.

718
01:12:02,862 --> 01:12:06,198
But honesty compels me to
inform you that I have other plans.

719
01:12:07,270 --> 01:12:07,895
Other plans?

720
01:12:08,138 --> 01:12:08,935
Very much sir.

721
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:11,672
Mercy Chant appeals more
to you than she does to me.

722
01:12:12,178 --> 01:12:15,514
I'm not disputing her merits
I'm only speaking of my own inclinations.

723
01:12:15,818 --> 01:12:16,717
My dearest boy.

724
01:12:17,220 --> 01:12:20,420
Angel.Please remember that
you are addressing your parents.

725
01:12:20,661 --> 01:12:21,389
I'm aware of that.

726
01:12:22,898 --> 01:12:24,868
I already know the woman I intend to marry.

727
01:12:25,737 --> 01:12:27,763
Her name is Teresa Durbeyfield.

728
01:12:30,978 --> 01:12:33,540
Father, Mother. I respect you both.

729
01:12:34,418 --> 01:12:36,888
I also respect Mercy Chant.
And have no doubt

730
01:12:37,123 --> 01:12:38,820
she'll find worthier husband with or

731
01:12:39,028 --> 01:12:44,094
without your help. As for me,
my mind is made up.

732
01:13:21,471 --> 01:13:22,233
Oh it's you...

733
01:13:22,472 --> 01:13:24,874
Tess, I want to ask you this now.

734
01:13:27,781 --> 01:13:28,578
Will you be my wife?

735
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:32,780
I love you with all my heart and soul.

736
01:13:42,141 --> 01:13:44,111
I can not be your wife.

737
01:13:45,781 --> 01:13:46,544
Don't you love me?

738
01:13:47,216 --> 01:13:48,582
Oh yes yes...

739
01:13:49,588 --> 01:13:52,525
I'd rather belong to you
than anyone in the world.

740
01:13:53,695 --> 01:13:59,194
Forgive me. I can't marry you.

741
01:14:32,297 --> 01:14:35,701
It was the good lord who put
this nice young person's in your way.

742
01:14:35,971 --> 01:14:37,064
You must believe that.

743
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:41,670
But with respects to your question,
I tell you quite private but

744
01:14:41,881 --> 01:14:46,186
very strong. On no accounts,
say a word about your bygone trouble.

745
01:14:46,857 --> 01:14:50,091
Never a word, my girl. Least of all to him.

746
01:14:58,244 --> 01:15:01,374
Tess. Why does the idea of
becoming my wife displease you?

747
01:15:01,516 --> 01:15:05,650
I never said that. It would please me so much.

748
01:15:08,196 --> 01:15:09,995
It's simply that I can not.

749
01:15:10,166 --> 01:15:13,137
Why? Is there someone else?

750
01:15:16,543 --> 01:15:17,978
Don't i deserve to know the truth?

751
01:15:20,083 --> 01:15:20,743
Well?

752
01:15:21,552 --> 01:15:22,281
Not now

753
01:15:22,788 --> 01:15:23,483
When then?

754
01:15:23,923 --> 01:15:24,686
Later.

755
01:15:24,892 --> 01:15:25,552
But why?

756
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:30,664
I'll tell you when we get home.

757
01:15:31,738 --> 01:15:33,730
You'll stop loving
me when you know.

758
01:15:35,712 --> 01:15:37,476
Let me wait till then.

759
01:16:05,833 --> 01:16:08,566
Londoners will drink it at
their breakfast tomorrow, won't they?

760
01:16:08,738 --> 01:16:11,072
Yes but watered down,
in case it goes to their heads.

761
01:16:11,510 --> 01:16:13,445
Strangers that we have never seen.

762
01:16:25,033 --> 01:16:26,764
You saw me once before.
you know that?

763
01:16:27,371 --> 01:16:27,894
I did?

764
01:16:28,774 --> 01:16:30,402
You wouldn't dance with me.

765
01:16:31,713 --> 01:16:32,646
It was at Marlott.

766
01:16:33,148 --> 01:16:33,911
Of course!

767
01:16:35,953 --> 01:16:37,182
That's incredible!

768
01:16:37,357 --> 01:16:38,153
You remember now?

769
01:16:38,558 --> 01:16:40,027
Tessy!Tessy!

770
01:16:43,834 --> 01:16:44,597
Now my girl.

771
01:16:45,236 --> 01:16:50,578
Yes. I may never again be
brave enough to tell my story.

772
01:16:50,848 --> 01:16:52,373
Then get on with your precious story.

773
01:16:52,984 --> 01:16:55,352
I was born at such and such place
and in such and such a year...

774
01:16:55,589 --> 01:16:59,392
I was born at Marlott and i grew up there.

775
01:17:00,831 --> 01:17:03,301
I was in the Sixth Form when I left school.

776
01:17:04,505 --> 01:17:06,235
They said that I would make a geed teacher.

777
01:17:09,580 --> 01:17:11,174
But there was trouble in my family.

778
01:17:13,388 --> 01:17:15,984
Father was no great worker.

779
01:17:17,262 --> 01:17:21,895
He drank. Anyway, my parents, they...

780
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:25,900
it was then that something happened.

781
01:17:27,379 --> 01:17:29,781
Something which changed my life like.

782
01:17:34,025 --> 01:17:40,492
They discovered
that we were not Durbeyfields

783
01:17:41,038 --> 01:17:42,164
but D'Urbervilles.

784
01:17:43,976 --> 01:17:45,103
WEll, go on.

785
01:17:47,048 --> 01:17:47,981
WEll, that's it.

786
01:17:49,386 --> 01:17:53,417
WEll the D'Urbervilles are an old family.

787
01:17:54,596 --> 01:17:55,221
I know

788
01:17:59,003 --> 01:18:04,309
On account of being of that
name my mother thought that...

789
01:18:07,585 --> 01:18:08,780
I was sent...

790
01:18:13,596 --> 01:18:15,691
-I had a...
-A what?

791
01:18:16,936 --> 01:18:18,598
I was told that you hated old families.

792
01:18:21,077 --> 01:18:22,010
Is that all the trouble?

793
01:18:23,881 --> 01:18:27,285
None of that matters, Tess. Say you'll be my wife.

794
01:18:28,222 --> 01:18:31,319
Say it, Tess. SAy it, my dear love!

795
01:18:33,599 --> 01:18:36,126
Yes yes yes...

796
01:18:44,986 --> 01:18:47,422
my health, my simplicity.

797
01:18:48,526 --> 01:18:50,825
I'm a strangeness of my situation.

798
01:18:51,564 --> 01:18:53,226
I perhaps lessen my fault.

799
01:18:58,110 --> 01:19:01,570
But since I've committed it I am guilty.

800
01:19:06,091 --> 01:19:07,252
I must be guilty.

801
01:19:08,227 --> 01:19:11,028
Because the lord sawfit to take my child.

802
01:19:13,905 --> 01:19:18,846
If what I have just written,
failed to pass my lips,

803
01:19:19,482 --> 01:19:24,115
in your presence, then I have
repeated it a thousand times

804
01:19:24,324 --> 01:19:30,358
in my heart. For it was the
fear of losing you forever.

805
01:19:34,241 --> 01:19:35,574
For love of you,

806
01:19:36,546 --> 01:19:40,610
Is hall conquer that fear
and bring you this letter

807
01:19:43,091 --> 01:19:44,957
Once you are savoured Angel

808
01:19:45,896 --> 01:19:49,163
you'll hold the rest
of my life in your hands.

809
01:19:51,639 --> 01:19:57,082
I hope and I tremble. I love you.

810
01:20:35,551 --> 01:20:36,314
Oh darling!

811
01:20:46,104 --> 01:20:48,734
I've been assumed to put
an edge on my appetite.

812
01:20:50,913 --> 01:20:52,108
I'm starving.

813
01:20:53,108 --> 01:21:03,108
