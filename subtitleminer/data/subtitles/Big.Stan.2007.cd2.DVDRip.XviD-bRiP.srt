00:00:03,188 --> 00:00:06,464
Minton, warden wants to see you.
Get up.

2
00:00:06,628 --> 00:00:08,903
- Me?
- Now! Walk!

3
00:00:10,068 --> 00:00:11,706
Put your hands behind your back.

4
00:00:15,068 --> 00:00:18,105
- [Knocking on door]
- Come in.

5
00:00:22,468 --> 00:00:24,743
Minton, I'm glad you could make it.

6
00:00:24,908 --> 00:00:28,139
- You can take the cuffs off him.
- Sure you wanna do that, Boss?

7
00:00:28,308 --> 00:00:30,299
I said take 'em off.

8
00:00:30,468 --> 00:00:32,936
It's all right.

9
00:00:33,108 --> 00:00:34,336
I already got 'em.

10
00:00:36,308 --> 00:00:38,264
It's a matter of dislocating the wrists.

11
00:00:38,428 --> 00:00:40,020
[Snaps]

Ew! Ew, that is creepy!

14
00:00:46,868 --> 00:00:49,985
- You can wait outside.
- [Shudders]

15

Have a seat.

16
00:00:57,628 --> 00:01:00,347
Warden, if this is about me
fighting in the yard, it...

17
00:01:00,508 --> 00:01:01,941
Cigar?

18
00:01:03,668 --> 00:01:05,067
Thank you.

19
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:09,817
Brandy?

20
00:01:11,468 --> 00:01:13,584
Sure.

21
00:01:23,068 --> 00:01:25,024
You know, you wardens should complain.

22
00:01:25,188 --> 00:01:29,227
'Cause in the movies,
they always make you look like assholes.

23
00:01:29,388 --> 00:01:34,257
[Laughs] Well,
I don't plan on being a warden forever.

24
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:36,942
- Is that right?
- Tell me, Minton.

25
00:01:37,108 --> 00:01:39,383
What do you think of this place?

26
00:01:40,788 --> 00:01:43,097
It's OK, for a prison.

27
00:01:43,268 --> 00:01:47,307
Not the prison. The land.

28
00:01:50,668 --> 00:01:55,344
It's a nice sized property. Great views
of the foothills and city. Level grade.

29
00:01:55,508 --> 00:01:58,705
I'm assuming there's
bedrock beneath us.

30
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:03,419
Easy access to downtown.
I see some nice development potential.

31
00:02:03,588 --> 00:02:06,625
- Too bad you got a prison on it.
- Exactly.

32
00:02:06,788 --> 00:02:10,940
You know, it's no accident
you came to Oaksburg.

33
00:02:11,108 --> 00:02:13,861
I pulled a few strings
to get you here.

34
00:02:16,828 --> 00:02:18,420
What made you wanna do that?

35
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:22,107
Come here.

36
00:02:25,828 --> 00:02:28,820
Oaksburg Estates.

37
00:02:28,988 --> 00:02:33,220
I'm a silent partner, so to speak,
with some private investors

38
00:02:33,388 --> 00:02:38,462
who would like to develop this land
into timeshare condominiums.

39
00:02:38,628 --> 00:02:42,337
I believe that's
your field of expertise.

40
00:02:42,508 --> 00:02:45,784
- True.
- 'Course, all this is only possible

41
00:02:45,948 --> 00:02:48,621
in the event the prison
ever closes down.

42
00:02:48,788 --> 00:02:52,303
- Makes sense.
- You know, I'm in the prison business.

43
00:02:52,468 --> 00:02:55,028
I know how to break a man's will,
crush his spirit.

44
00:02:55,188 --> 00:02:59,227
But them real estate contracts,
those things put a real hurt on you.

45
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:00,867
That's where you come in.

46
00:03:05,428 --> 00:03:08,261
- What's in it for me?
- How would you like to be out of here

47
00:03:08,428 --> 00:03:09,417
in a year?

48
00:03:11,548 --> 00:03:15,700
- But I've got a mandatory minimum.
- Wardens have great discretion

49
00:03:15,868 --> 00:03:20,498
getting early parole, especially
to non-violent, first-time offenders.

50
00:03:20,668 --> 00:03:25,139
- Prisons are crowded, you know.
- The system is corrupt.

51
00:03:25,308 --> 00:03:26,502
Me likey.

52
00:03:26,668 --> 00:03:30,104
But you gotta move the luxury units
closer to the lagoon.

53
00:03:30,268 --> 00:03:32,828
That'll double rents.
Parking goes underground.

54
00:03:32,988 --> 00:03:36,264
Wasting space. Eight extra units.
Whoever designed this is a moron.

55
00:03:36,428 --> 00:03:39,306
- How will you get rid of the prison?
- Let me worry about that.

56
00:03:39,468 --> 00:03:41,698
Tell me more about them parking spaces.

57
00:03:46,828 --> 00:03:50,946
[Stan singing in Spanish]

58
00:04:06,228 --> 00:04:08,503
You strapped?

59
00:04:08,668 --> 00:04:10,943
He ain't gonna know what hit him,
nah mean?

60
00:04:22,868 --> 00:04:23,857
Ah!

61

That's gonna scar, you psycho.

- Whoo!
- [Grunts]

63

You want that shiv, don't you?

64
00:04:49,508 --> 00:04:52,261
You made that with a melted toothbrush
and a razorblade?

65
00:04:52,428 --> 00:04:54,100
- That's very creative.
- Ah!

66
00:05:00,028 --> 00:05:03,145
Look what I made
with three bars of soap and a shoelace.

67
00:05:04,348 --> 00:05:06,179

[All shouting]

80

Hey, Stan. What'd you do to Patterson?

81
00:06:03,308 --> 00:06:05,583
I just roughed him up a little bit.

82
00:06:05,748 --> 00:06:09,343
- Why?
- Somebody took a shiv to his ass.

83
00:06:09,508 --> 00:06:14,024
They say he'll be shitting sideways
for a month. [laughs]

84
00:06:14,188 --> 00:06:16,907
Now I know
what schadenfreude feels like.

85
00:06:17,068 --> 00:06:18,865
- What?
- Schadenfreude.

86
00:06:19,028 --> 00:06:22,623
It's German for when you feel good
because your enemy's anus is violated.

87
00:06:22,788 --> 00:06:24,665
Oh.

88

I can't get Mindy's lawyer
to return my call.

92

with this divorce,

to contact her personally.

[Grunting, farting]

Ain't you Charlize Theron?

103
00:07:25,548 --> 00:07:28,506
Oh, look what fell out there.

104
00:07:34,508 --> 00:07:37,898
[Laughing] So I had them
exchange the beef for horse meat.

105
00:07:38,068 --> 00:07:40,980
- Clever.
- That's Stan.

106
00:07:41,148 --> 00:07:43,457
Minton, I'd like for you
to meet Mr Dang.

107
00:07:43,628 --> 00:07:45,584
He's on the prison's board of governors.

108
00:07:45,748 --> 00:07:49,627
They let Vietnamese mafia on
the prison board of governors?

109
00:07:51,348 --> 00:07:52,463
Your finger tats.

110
00:07:53,788 --> 00:07:59,181
[Laughs] Like you say, Stan,
the system is corrupt.

111
00:07:59,348 --> 00:08:03,341
Mr Dang's family happens to be
my partners in Oaksburg Estates.

112
00:08:03,508 --> 00:08:06,147
Oh, good, 'cause I was just
going over the contracts.

113
00:08:06,308 --> 00:08:09,300
The language gets rather vague
on gross versus net liability.

114
00:08:09,468 --> 00:08:12,824
I'm sure it's unintentional, but that
could screw you in the long run.

115
00:08:12,988 --> 00:08:17,778
Could it? I'll have my lawyers
correct that immediately.

116
00:08:17,948 --> 00:08:21,258
I got an excellent lawyer for that.
He specialises in it. Lew Popper.

117
00:08:21,428 --> 00:08:24,738
Popper? I'll be sure to contact him.

118
00:08:24,908 --> 00:08:28,617
[Laughs] Come on, Dang,
let's check out the floor show.

[Gasque] Well, give me a few more weeks.
I'll even have 'em readier.

122
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:44,265
[Dang] I'm counting on that.

123
00:08:45,668 --> 00:08:47,784
Would you like a strawberry?

124
00:08:49,068 --> 00:08:52,140
- I grew them in my own garden.
- Thank you.

125

Minton? Strawberry?

126
00:08:55,748 --> 00:08:56,817
No, I'm good.

127

[Gasque] Maybe I picked 'em
a little too soon.

128
00:09:07,348 --> 00:09:09,225
I don't think that's it.

for a little pot-sticker.

157
00:10:48,828 --> 00:10:50,546
[Shorts] Who are you writing to?

158
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:52,938
No one special.

159
00:10:54,188 --> 00:10:57,385
You've been sitting there for a while
writing to no one special.

160
00:10:59,508 --> 00:11:04,343
You know, Stan, I've been here for a
long time. I can handle a lot of things.

161
00:11:04,508 --> 00:11:08,057
Like having to spend the rest
of my life in this shithole.

162
00:11:08,228 --> 00:11:11,345
But there's one thing I do regret.

163
00:11:11,508 --> 00:11:14,864
I could never make it work
with Miyoshi.

164
00:11:15,028 --> 00:11:20,785
Oh, she was the only person
who ever loved me for me.

165
00:11:22,668 --> 00:11:25,626
I was too pigheaded to realise it.

166
00:11:25,788 --> 00:11:30,908
[Sighs] I'd give anything
to change the way I behaved.

167
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:33,426
How did you behave?

168
00:11:34,508 --> 00:11:35,623
I killed her.

169
00:11:37,228 --> 00:11:38,502
Oh.

170
00:11:38,668 --> 00:11:43,298
Alcohol wasn't something that always
brought out the best in me, Stan.

171
00:12:02,628 --> 00:12:06,541
<i>[Stan] Dear Mindy, I've been
thinking a lot about you lately.</i>

172
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:08,426
<i>About us.</i>

173
00:12:08,588 --> 00:12:10,658
<i>I realise now that you were right.</i>

174
00:12:10,828 --> 00:12:14,059
<i>I was pigheaded and selfish.</i>

175
00:12:14,228 --> 00:12:17,664
<i>Leaving me was probably
the best thing for you.</i>

176
00:12:17,828 --> 00:12:19,739
<i>And I'm truly sorry.</i>

177
00:12:19,908 --> 00:12:22,502
<i>I never should have hurt you.</i>

178
00:12:22,668 --> 00:12:25,580
<i>I know now why you wanted
to have a baby with me.</i>

179
00:12:25,748 --> 00:12:27,943
<i>It's just another way
for us to love each other</i>

180
00:12:28,108 --> 00:12:30,747
<i>even more deeply.</i>

181
00:12:30,908 --> 00:12:34,298
<i>I hope, someday,
you'll be able to forgive me.</i>

182
00:12:34,468 --> 00:12:37,266
<i>Love always, Stan.</i>

183
00:12:42,468 --> 00:12:44,106
[The Master] Hey, baby.

184
00:12:52,468 --> 00:12:56,302
Now, I know all of you want to get back
to your weightlifting and basketball

185
00:12:56,468 --> 00:12:59,778
and masturbating, so I'm gonna
try to keep this short. All right?

186
00:12:59,948 --> 00:13:05,227
I am throwing away all of these
violent video games and movies.

187
00:13:05,388 --> 00:13:06,946
[All groaning]

188
00:13:07,108 --> 00:13:09,463
Don't do that! No! Come on, man!

189
00:13:09,628 --> 00:13:13,018
From now on, I want you guys
watching more wholesome entertainment.

190
00:13:13,188 --> 00:13:16,544
And frankly, a lot of the rap music
you brothers listen to

191
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:19,063
- was too hateful towards women.
- [All laughing]

192
00:13:19,228 --> 00:13:22,186
What is up with that?
You like women, right?

193
00:13:22,348 --> 00:13:23,497
[All] Yeah!

194
00:13:23,668 --> 00:13:25,340
Now, on the other hand,

195
00:13:25,508 --> 00:13:28,580
the Mexicans are onto something
with mariachi and salsa music.

196
00:13:28,748 --> 00:13:30,864
[Cheering]

197
00:13:32,348 --> 00:13:35,545
It's positive, easy to dance to
and you never get tired of it.

198
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:38,461
- Shorts, give us a taste.
- Here we go.

199
00:13:38,628 --> 00:13:43,224
<i>[Salsa music plays]</i>

<i>[Man singing in Spanish]</i>

[Cheering, whistling]

202
00:13:52,988 --> 00:13:54,421
[Cheering]

203
00:14:12,628 --> 00:14:14,186
Holy shit.

204
00:14:16,268 --> 00:14:19,146
- All right. All right, all right.
- [Music stops]

205
00:14:19,308 --> 00:14:22,698
That's Afro-Cuban. I asked
for mariachi. But you get the point.

206
00:14:22,868 --> 00:14:25,940
All right? Now, lastly,
and most importantly,

207
00:14:26,108 --> 00:14:28,906
from now on, there will
be no more rape at this prison.

208
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:31,502
- [All shouting]
- No, no!

209
00:14:31,668 --> 00:14:34,899
That's right.
Anyone who rapes another inmate

210
00:14:35,068 --> 00:14:37,821
- will have to answer to me.
- [Man] Boo!

211
00:14:37,988 --> 00:14:39,626
[Stan] I will not be kind.

212
00:14:39,788 --> 00:14:42,541
- Excuse me, Big Stan.
- Yes, Juanito.

213
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:45,063
Why you putting your nose
where it don't belong?

214
00:14:45,228 --> 00:14:47,378
My men are aggressive and hard.

215
00:14:47,548 --> 00:14:51,257
Sometimes they need a way to work off
that excess energy. What's it to you?

216
00:14:51,428 --> 00:14:54,306
- OK. Well, first off, good question.
- Thank you.

217
00:14:54,468 --> 00:14:58,507
What is it to me?
Well, frankly, I just don't like it.

218
00:14:58,668 --> 00:15:02,377
And let me show you why.
Robbie, come up here.

219
00:15:02,548 --> 00:15:04,345
You, Robbie the hippie.
Come up here.

220
00:15:04,508 --> 00:15:06,738
[All whistling]

221
00:15:09,028 --> 00:15:12,782
All right, all right. Robbie, how long
is your sentence here at Oaksburg?

222
00:15:12,948 --> 00:15:16,702
- Five to ten.
- Five to ten years.

223
00:15:16,868 --> 00:15:19,621
What exactly did you do
to earn that sentence?

224
00:15:19,788 --> 00:15:23,144
- I sold marijuana.
- [Laughter]

225
00:15:23,308 --> 00:15:26,823
- A shitload of marijuana.
- [Cheering]

226
00:15:28,948 --> 00:15:31,018
Thanks, Robbie. Go sit down.

227
00:15:31,188 --> 00:15:34,578
He sold marijuana.
He was a marijuana dealer.

228
00:15:34,748 --> 00:15:38,502
I'm not here to argue about drug policy.
I don't think they're tough enough.

229
00:15:38,668 --> 00:15:42,217
- [Protesting]
- Whatever.

230
00:15:42,388 --> 00:15:45,619
Butjust because Robbie was guilty
of selling dope

231
00:15:45,788 --> 00:15:50,578
doesn't mean he deserves to get raped
up the ass every day for ten years.

232
00:15:50,748 --> 00:15:52,898
I just don't think that's fair.

233
00:15:53,068 --> 00:15:55,980
- [Murmuring]
- Some of you are here

234
00:15:56,148 --> 00:16:01,859
because you're habitual drunk drivers.
Some of you have a fondness for crack.

235
00:16:02,028 --> 00:16:05,065
- [Laughing, murmuring]
- Some of you robbed a bank.

236
00:16:05,228 --> 00:16:08,743
- I'm talking to you, Lee Otis.
- [Laughing]

237
00:16:10,988 --> 00:16:14,663
But that doesn't mean you should
get raped. It's just not fair.

238
00:16:16,268 --> 00:16:19,624
- Yes, Carnahan.
- What about guys convicted of rape?

239
00:16:19,788 --> 00:16:22,985
- Can we rape them?
- [All] Yeah!

240
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:25,139
Rape the rapists.
Seems appropriate.

241
00:16:25,308 --> 00:16:27,742
Punishment fitting the crime and all.
Go ahead.

242
00:16:27,908 --> 00:16:30,661
- [Cheering]
- [Man] That's what I'm talkin' about.

243
00:16:30,828 --> 00:16:35,219
- How about them child molesters?
- [All] Yeah!

244
00:16:35,388 --> 00:16:37,663
Yeah, them too. Good point.
Anyone else?

245
00:16:37,828 --> 00:16:40,217
[Cheering]

246
00:16:42,788 --> 00:16:43,937
[Big Raymond] Big Stan!

247
00:16:44,108 --> 00:16:48,260
- What about the counterfeiters?
- [All] What?

248
00:16:48,428 --> 00:16:52,580
Counterfeiters? Big Raymond,
you're the only counterfeiter here.

249
00:16:52,748 --> 00:16:55,467
[Man] Yeah!

250
00:16:55,628 --> 00:16:58,665
Wait a minute.
Do you just want somebody to?

251
00:16:58,828 --> 00:17:01,103
[All] Aw!

252
00:17:01,268 --> 00:17:03,338
OK, here's another thing
we gotta clear up.

253
00:17:03,508 --> 00:17:06,500
There's a difference
between homosexual sex and rape.

254
00:17:06,668 --> 00:17:10,104
- Now, Big Raymond.
- Hm?

255
00:17:10,268 --> 00:17:12,987
There's someone here
who wants to have sex with you.

256
00:17:13,148 --> 00:17:15,537
- [Man] Not me!
- OK? How about it, anyone?

257
00:17:17,468 --> 00:17:20,426
Yeah. Yeah.

258
00:17:20,588 --> 00:17:22,897
[Laughter]

259
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:26,499
Tyler!

260
00:17:26,668 --> 00:17:31,025
- Great!
- Man! [giggles]

261
00:17:40,148 --> 00:17:43,140
You two have fun.
But wear protection.

262
00:17:43,308 --> 00:17:45,219
- [Cheering]
- [Big Raymond] OK.

263
00:17:45,388 --> 00:17:49,904
All right, grow up. Look, if you've got
a problem with that, then that's...

264
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:52,298
[farting, groaning]

[Farts]

268
00:18:01,108 --> 00:18:04,817
Now, those two are about to have
consensual homosexual sex.

269
00:18:04,988 --> 00:18:07,866
A beautiful, beautiful thing.
The total opposite of rape,

270
00:18:08,028 --> 00:18:11,100
- which is not allowed.
- Except for rapists and molesters?

271
00:18:11,268 --> 00:18:13,384
- We can still rape them.
- No, you can't.

272
00:18:13,548 --> 00:18:16,824
- [All] What?
- I changed my mind.

273
00:18:16,988 --> 00:18:18,501
Bad habit. Quit cold turkey.

274
00:18:18,668 --> 00:18:21,944
- [All yelling]
- If you're not happy with it,

275
00:18:22,108 --> 00:18:25,703
- you're welcome to fight me.
- [Groaning]

276
00:18:26,588 --> 00:18:29,056
I didn't think so.
All right, you're dismissed.

277
00:18:29,228 --> 00:18:31,344
Beat it.

278
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:35,097
- Good speech.
- You think?

279
00:18:35,268 --> 00:18:38,066
- I should have opened with a joke.
- No, it was good.

280
00:18:38,228 --> 00:18:41,379
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Sorry about the mariachi.

281
00:18:41,548 --> 00:18:42,697
Let it go.

282
00:18:44,628 --> 00:18:48,860
Hey, Big Stan.
Check out the lovebirds.

283
00:18:51,348 --> 00:18:54,146
- One for you!
- [Giggles]

284

Mm! One for you.

285
00:18:58,228 --> 00:18:59,377
Good for them.

286
00:19:00,948 --> 00:19:03,098
I have something important to show you.

287
00:19:03,268 --> 00:19:04,383
Let me eat, will you?

288
00:19:04,548 --> 00:19:05,742
Hey, Big Stan.

289
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:10,984
- Can we talk?
- Make it quick.

290
00:19:11,148 --> 00:19:13,264
I wanna thank you
for what you did out there.

291
00:19:13,428 --> 00:19:16,659
- I didn't do anything...
- Don't say you didn't do it for me.

292
00:19:16,828 --> 00:19:19,865
Because you did, didn't you?

293
00:19:21,148 --> 00:19:24,220
- A little.
- Well, thanks.

294
00:19:24,388 --> 00:19:27,664
- Yeah. Thanks, man.
- [Juanito] Julio!

295
00:19:27,828 --> 00:19:30,422
Get back here!
What's up with you? [speaks Spanish]

296
00:19:30,588 --> 00:19:31,657
Shut up!

- Yes, you do.

OK, you're in.

302
00:19:52,388 --> 00:19:55,858
[Man clears throat] Me too?

303
00:20:00,668 --> 00:20:04,980
- Yeah, you too.
- [Giggling]

304
00:20:07,588 --> 00:20:10,341
- All of you.
- Thanks.

- Yeah! Ow!

306
00:20:14,908 --> 00:20:17,217
All right, can I eat now?

307
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:22,780
- [Big Raymond] Yes, you did!
- He's gotta eat.

308
00:20:26,428 --> 00:20:28,988
I told you I had something important

00:46:14,548 --> 00:46:16,061
Say bye.

625
00:46:21,988 --> 00:46:23,023
Stan!

626
00:46:25,468 --> 00:46:27,743
Sweetie.

627
00:46:27,908 --> 00:46:29,785
Hey, handsome.

628
00:46:29,948 --> 00:46:32,064
- Where's Mindy Junior?
- In the car.

629
00:46:32,228 --> 00:46:35,186
- She's being kind of a brat.
- Isn't the nanny helping?

630
00:46:35,348 --> 00:46:37,942
Yeah. I think he
still sneaks cigarettes.

631
00:46:38,108 --> 00:46:40,702
Yeah? I'll talk to him.

632
00:46:41,908 --> 00:46:43,500
[Coughing]

633
00:46:46,028 --> 00:46:48,667
Hi, precious. Hi, The Master.

634
00:46:48,828 --> 00:46:51,342
- Say hello to your father, child.
- Hi.

635
00:46:51,508 --> 00:46:54,739
- Rumour is you're sneaking smokes.
- Shh.

636
00:46:55,548 --> 00:46:58,938
- How's her technique?
- She stinks.

637
00:46:59,108 --> 00:47:00,780
But so did you at first.

638
00:47:00,948 --> 00:47:03,701
You sure? I don't remember that.

639
00:47:03,868 --> 00:47:05,665
- [Mindy] Stan!
- OK, baby.

640
00:47:05,828 --> 00:47:07,625
[Mindy] Let's go, sweetie!

641
00:47:12,948 --> 00:47:15,223
[Mindy] Whoo-hoo!

642
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:26,223
