00:00:27,422 --> 00:00:33,254
THE INGLORIOUS BASTARDS

2
00:02:18,254 --> 00:02:22,000
FRANCE 1944

3
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:10,174
-Are you alone here?
-Yes, I was a prisoner.

4
00:24:10,305 --> 00:24:13,837
-But I fled.
-And?

5
00:24:13,973 --> 00:24:16,723
I am unarmed.

6
00:24:17,724 --> 00:24:20,807
-What's your name?
-Private Adolf Sachs.

7
00:24:20,933 --> 00:24:25,095
ID number 1 040.

8
00:24:36,105 --> 00:24:38,511
Come here.

9
00:24:39,441 --> 00:24:42,522
Nice and easy.

10
00:25:02,448 --> 00:25:08,815
-Which is the safest way to Switzerland?
-The germans sieged the villages.

11
00:25:08,951 --> 00:25:14,286
The safest yet longest way
is through the woods

12
00:26:26,937 --> 00:26:30,268
First group, forward!

13
00:26:30,397 --> 00:26:32,803
Hurry up!

14
00:26:32,939 --> 00:26:36,188
Watch out for dud granades!

15
00:26:44,818 --> 00:26:47,273
Take cover, fast!

16
00:27:09,494 --> 00:27:12,659
Take cover! Hurry up!

17
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:15,988
To the right!

18
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:19,323
Prepare for battle!

19
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:11,027
Stop!

20
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:16,988
Come here!

21
00:31:19,583 --> 00:31:23,745
-Who are the americans?
-Four soldiers and an officer.

22
00:31:24,209 --> 00:31:27,125
-Where did you come from?
-Saint Michel.

23
00:31:27,253 --> 00:31:30,749
-We attacked and captured them.
-Where are you taking them?

24
00:31:30,879 --> 00:31:35,952
-To the headquarters for
further interrogation.

25
00:31:36,089 --> 00:31:42,171
-The new order is: no prisoners!
-The army didn't receive that order.

26
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:46,295
And they call themself soldiers.

27
00:31:46,719 --> 00:31:50,464
They're a bunch of cowards!

28
00:31:59,098 --> 00:32:02,049
What have you got there?

29
00:32:03,932 --> 00:32:06,256
Trouble...

30
00:32:07,683 --> 00:32:10,517
-Lieutenant!
-Yes, captain!

31
00:32:10,643 --> 00:32:13,595
-Shoot those men!

32
00:32:14,311 --> 00:32:19,017
But those men are prisoners
of the army, not Waffen-SS!

33
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:23,971
Ah, to hell with Waffen-SS!
You have an american machine gun.

34
00:32:25,649 --> 00:32:30,391
Shoot this traitor too!
Vehicles, drive on.

35
00:32:32,234 --> 00:32:35,767
Carry out the order and follow us.

36
00:33:19,375 --> 00:33:21,700
Take cover!

37
00:38:38,282 --> 00:38:40,853
Papers please.

38
00:41:08,294 --> 00:41:10,699
Americans!

39
00:41:19,922 --> 00:41:22,922
Ten beautiful women.

40
00:44:11,234 --> 00:44:13,557
Americans!

41
00:44:14,484 --> 00:44:16,808
Americans!

42
00:47:09,672 --> 00:47:12,457
Americans.

43
00:49:09,465 --> 00:49:14,917
Nicole, here's an american.
Take great care of him.

44
00:49:15,050 --> 00:49:20,752
Marcel and Robert, take care of
the americans lodgings!

45
00:49:22,052 --> 00:49:25,052
Are you american?

46
00:49:25,179 --> 00:49:27,503
Sit down.

47
00:53:29,016 --> 00:53:31,884
Want to buy?

48
00:53:32,017 --> 00:53:34,340
The watch?

49
00:53:51,523 --> 00:53:55,435
Nicole, bring the aid box!

50
00:53:55,567 --> 00:53:59,644
There's almost nothing left,
just some bandages.

51
00:54:06,154 --> 00:54:09,651
-What is it?

52
00:55:49,566 --> 00:55:53,607
-Nicole, we're waiting for you.
-I'm coming!

53
00:56:01,946 --> 00:56:04,778
Au revoir.

54
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:26,071
Turn on the searchlight!

55
00:56:26,203 --> 00:56:29,452
Come on now, hurry!

56
00:56:41,293 --> 00:56:43,782
Get ready

57
00:57:01,715 --> 00:57:05,876
Quick, hide the parachute
and put out the fire.

58
00:59:11,554 --> 00:59:15,930
-Come on, hurry up down there!
-Have you seen, Pierre?

59
00:59:19,517 --> 00:59:22,300
What are they doing?

60
00:59:40,106 --> 00:59:42,774
See you soon.

61
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:46,894
Hurry up and load the stuff.

62
01:00:26,123 --> 01:00:32,407
-I have two american prisoners here.
-What shall we do with them?

63
01:00:32,542 --> 01:00:36,406
-I need a car.
-Can you affirm that?

64
01:00:36,543 --> 01:00:40,585
What do you mean "affirm"?
What the fuck do you mean by that?

65
01:00:41,253 --> 01:00:47,453
We were to transport the prisoners,
but our truck was blown up.

66
01:00:47,589 --> 01:00:51,964
We've been walking for two days
and are exhausted.

67
01:00:52,632 --> 01:00:55,999
-We don't...
-Come here!

68
01:01:01,009 --> 01:01:03,416
Heil Hitler!

69
01:01:03,553 --> 01:01:08,046
-What's going on here?
-Nothing, sir.

70
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:14,257
I have two american prisoners
and I need a vehicle.

71
01:01:14,389 --> 01:01:19,890
You can have a new car,
but the prisoners stays.

72
01:01:20,017 --> 01:01:24,094
Quiet! - Bring the prisoners
to my office.

73
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:26,884
Let's go.

74
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,951
Here's the car.

75
01:06:56,179 --> 01:07:00,044
-Don't shoot!

76
01:07:00,180 --> 01:07:03,927
Throw your weapons under the table.

77
01:11:20,315 --> 01:11:22,982
What are you doing?

78
01:11:23,106 --> 01:11:26,189
Look out, it's a trap!

79
01:11:30,443 --> 01:11:33,442
Move it, come on.

80
01:12:18,168 --> 01:12:20,539
Papers, please.

81
01:12:30,839 --> 01:12:34,917
Everything's under control.
Let them pass.

82
01:12:51,347 --> 01:12:56,634
A mere mistake can be fatal,
so everything must be perfect.

83
01:13:13,729 --> 01:13:16,267
Your papers, please.

84
01:13:21,315 --> 01:13:25,357
Everything is in order.
You may step aboard.

85
01:13:25,483 --> 01:13:28,518
Thank you.

86
01:13:37,573 --> 01:13:42,361
General Tieck, officer
Ritter and Schaefer!

87
01:13:42,490 --> 01:13:48,691
Good to meet you. The train will
depart in a few minutes. Sit, please.

88
01:13:48,826 --> 01:13:53,450
We would prefer to start our
work immediately, general.

89
01:13:53,578 --> 01:13:59,695
Sorry, but no one is allowed in the
laboratory before departion.

90
01:14:00,579 --> 01:14:05,868
-Oh, of course not.
-Of course not.

91
01:14:16,376 --> 01:14:19,293
Hello? Hello?

92
01:14:57,725 --> 01:15:01,850
The train just took off.
What? Yes.

93
01:15:36,739 --> 01:15:41,150
We've departed. May
we start working now?

94
01:15:41,283 --> 01:15:45,776
Yes, but first you'll have to
turn over your weapons first.

95
01:15:45,909 --> 01:15:49,856
-It's a mere formality.
-Yes, of course.

96
01:16:27,798 --> 01:16:31,461
Major Schaefer, major Ritter?

97
01:16:31,591 --> 01:16:35,455
I'm cardinal Hauser. Cardinal
Brenner is in the darkroom.

98
01:16:35,594 --> 01:16:40,928
He'll be assisting you shortly.
Have a seat, please.

99
01:16:41,929 --> 01:16:46,339
Brenner told me you've been
working together.

100
01:17:06,105 --> 01:17:08,476
Charming...

101
01:17:09,564 --> 01:17:11,804
Stop!

102
01:17:19,276 --> 01:17:22,061
Damnit!

103
01:17:34,364 --> 01:17:39,652
Here is a detailed description.
Everything you need is in there.

104
01:17:40,534 --> 01:17:43,947
Have fun, you'll have to
excuse me now.

105
01:19:01,604 --> 01:19:04,092
Stop!

106
01:19:27,737 --> 01:19:31,948
I'm going to pay cardinal
Brenner a visit.

107
01:19:32,657 --> 01:19:34,945
Certainly.

108
01:19:36,117 --> 01:19:40,610
Cardinal Brenner, major Schaefer
comes to pay you a visit.

109
01:19:49,204 --> 01:19:51,956
-Schaefer?
-Yes, sir.

110
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:56,704
Nice to see you again.
One moment please.

111
01:20:08,211 --> 01:20:11,826
-What happened?
-He felt nauseous.

112
01:21:30,658 --> 01:21:33,775
Prepare for battle!

113
01:21:39,243 --> 01:21:43,025
-The bridge is destroyed.
-Why do we stop?

114
01:21:43,161 --> 01:21:49,529
Make contact with the headquarters.
We need to protect the rocket.

115
01:21:56,875 --> 01:22:02,210
There is another way, but
it goes to near the american line.

116
01:22:02,334 --> 01:22:06,376
Tell the engineer to back all
the way to the trackswitches.

117
01:22:15,423 --> 01:22:18,171
-Where's cardinal Brenner?

118
01:22:18,298 --> 01:22:22,757
In the darkroom. I'll
go see how he's doing.

119
01:24:31,180 --> 01:24:37,296
Contact Pont Mosson immediately.
As you can see on the map...

120
01:24:37,431 --> 01:24:43,431
Hello? The bridge is destroyed
We're coming back.

121
01:24:43,975 --> 01:24:47,307
How's the situation at your place?

122
01:24:47,436 --> 01:24:51,300
Notify the general that the situation
is calm and the track is safe.

123
01:24:51,438 --> 01:24:55,218
Yes, the situation is calm
and the track is safe.

124
01:25:08,193 --> 01:25:10,979
Do you have some chocolate?

125
01:25:30,992 --> 01:25:33,280
Follow me!

126
01:27:14,363 --> 01:27:18,406
Gather the wounded ones
and get your guns.

127
01:27:26,534 --> 01:27:32,367
Where did they come from?
-A train full of germans! Hide!

128
01:27:36,205 --> 01:27:38,777
Hurry up!

129
01:28:59,277 --> 01:29:02,607
-What's going on?
-Stand still!

130
01:29:50,168 --> 01:29:54,459
I just saw someone who
fell off the train.

131
01:30:37,934 --> 01:30:40,851
Quick, open the door!

132
01:31:09,364 --> 01:31:12,112
He's hiding in there.

133
01:37:00,531 --> 01:37:03,730
Help! Help us!

134
01:37:46,421 --> 01:37:51,543
THE INGLORIOUS BASTARDS
