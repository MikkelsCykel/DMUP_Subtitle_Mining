<i>The Mexican cartels have
1,500 miles of border between them</i>

2
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,840
<i>and the greatest drug-consuming
nation on earth...</i>

3
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,320
<i>...separated
by a 15-foot-high fence</i>

4
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,720
<i>which starts at the Pacific Ocean</i>

5
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,000
<i>and travels the distance
of four states.</i>

6
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,400
<i>They flood our streets,
day after day, week after week,</i>

7
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,760
<i>at an average of 20 tons a month.</i>

8
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,480
<i>That's enough to provide
a line of cocaine</i>

9
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,120
<i>for every man, woman,
and child on this planet.</i>

10
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,880
<i>- Yeah?
- It's me.</i>

11
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,920
What's up?

12
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,400
I've got tickets
to the Tuesday game.

13
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,960
<i>- Is that right?
- Row 10, seat 14.</i>

14
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,640
14? Oh, I'm with that!
I'll see you there.

15
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,600
<i>From 10 tons
a week ago in Colombia</i>

16
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,640
<i>to one bump tonight in L.A.,</i>

17
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,400
<i>worlds away from the men</i>

18
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,120
<i>who run
the whole goddamned show.</i>

19
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,800
And remember, no one must
make all the arrests.

20
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,840
We book them downtown,

21
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,480
and the extradition will
take place from there.

22
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,960
Are we clear?

23
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,240
We're clear that you wouldn't be
going in there without us.

24
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,680
You heard the man.

25
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,840
Let's get ready to move.
Demetrius, let's have the gun.

26
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,880
<i>- Esta loco.
- You gotta be kidding me, Frost.</i>

27
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:06,040
We are on their turf.
Isn't that right, Sean?

28
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,400
Come on.

29
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,880
<i>Memo Lucero was a Colombian</i>

30
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,240
<i>who saw opportunity in Mexico's
northern border towns.</i>

31
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,400
<i>He set up shop in Tijuana</i>

32
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,840
<i>and built the busiest,
most lucrative drug pipeline</i>

33
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,160
<i>the world has ever seen.</i>

34
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,840
<i>Lucero never slept
in the same place twice,</i>

35
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,080
<i>so no one
ever knew where he was.</i>

36
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:59,760
<i>But after seven years,
we finally tracked him down.</i>

37
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,520
Let's go.

38
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,800
Frost, this is stupid.

39
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,160
They call us down here.
They take away our weapons?

40
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,000
They expect us to go
into a building

41
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,720
full of drunken
cartel gunmen unarmed?

42
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,200
I mean, that isn't fun.

43
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,080
You're not getting paid
to have fun.

44
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,200
Good luck, gentlemen.

45
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,360
Bureaucrats!

46
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,480
<i>Ay, chingado.</i>

47
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,400
All right.

48
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,120
Stay down!

49
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,040
Shit!

50
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,320
You have no idea what kind
of mistake you're making.

51
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,400
Put your hands up!

52
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,760
Things are only
gonna get worse, for all of us.

53
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,840
Do me a favor
and shut the fuck up!

54
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,000
Come on.

55
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,640
Boss, let me go home
and see my wife.

56
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,720
- I'll think about it.
- I can't go home and see my wife?

57
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,200
I'll think about it!
Get out of here, you knucklehead!

58
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,120
Hey! Good job!

59
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,520
Damn right, good job!

60
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,240
Seven years, dog!

61
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,560
We got him!

62
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,080
<i>- Where are you?
- Honey, I'm still down here.</i>

63
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:16,440
<i>- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.</i>

64
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,200
<i>It was a little crazy,</i>

65
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,920
<i>but I'll be home tomorrow
or the next day.</i>

66
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,120
Right.

67
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,600
<i>Baby...</i>

68
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,280
<i>...what are you wearing?</i>

69
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,960
One of your old jerseys.

70
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,240
Not that blue one that you
look incredibly sexy in.

71
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,160
Yeah, the one that
smells like you.

72
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,360
<i>- Is that a good thing?
- It's a great thing.</i>

73
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,520
<i>What are you doing right now?</i>

74
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,480
Making candles.

75
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,480
Is that pine or evergreen?

76
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,320
Sean!

77
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,560
It's my favorite one.

78
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,160
Of course it is.

79
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,560
Oh, I miss you!

80
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,560
Two months ago,
with the arrest of Memo Lucero,

81
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,280
we finally dealt the Pacific corridor

82
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,120
its first substantial blow.

83
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,800
<i>We didn't talk like cops,
we didn't look like cops,</i>

84
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,800
<i>we didn't act like cops.</i>

85
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,640
<i>For that matter, we never
hung out with them, either.</i>

86
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,480
<i>We had an edge that came
from growing up on the streets.</i>

87
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,240
<i>That's why were
the most successful</i>

88
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,800
<i>anti-narcotics crew
in law enforcement.</i>

89
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:31,000
We made the dent that
the naysayers said we couldn't make.

90
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,640
<i>From this day forward,
things will be different.</i>

91
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,080
<i>By taking out Lucero,</i>

92
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,200
<i>we have cut the head
off the dragon.</i>

93
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:46,200
<i>And now we are sending
an emphatic message</i>

94
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:49,200
to anyone out there
who may have designs

95
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,640
on filling the void
left by Memo Lucero.

96
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,640
The cartels know now

97
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,040
<i>that the U.S. will not stand by idly</i>

98
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,800
<i>while they pollute our shores
with their narcotics.</i>

99
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,120
What's happening, homes?

100
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:09,320
<i>Peace will be restored,
and the flow of cocaine will stop.</i>

101
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,080
I'm happy to announce
that, effective today,

102
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:39,760
their business
in Southern California is over.

103
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,000
To the men and women
of our undercover units,

104
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,120
enjoy the accolades,
because you've certainly earned them.

105
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,080
They want to play in a tournament.
They want to ball against us, dog.

106
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,600
Against who?

107
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,520
Ramon Cardena
was killed yesterday.

108
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,720
- Who, Lucero's guy?
- Yeah, state's attorney's.

109
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,440
I'm not gonna shed
any tears over it,

110
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,080
but I am concerned
about one thing--

111
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,520
this could get a little bit messy.

112
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,400
Frost, this is for you.

113
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,800
It's eucalyptus, for enlightenment.

114
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,760
Enlightenment?
Baby, he's a senior citizen.

115
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,960
- Give him the Viagra candle.
- Sean!

116
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,520
Big Sexy!

117
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,520
What's up, dog?

118
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,720
What did I tell you about smoking?

119
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,840
I got you, dog.

120
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,080
You don't want me to
put you in the sleeper hold.

121
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,640
What's up with all these
damn narc cars out here?

122
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,040
Is this a police convention?

123
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,280
Supposed to be
a damn barbecue, dog.

124
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:18,400
Believe me, you're cool here.
You're with me. It's my house.

125
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,800
I sure hope
it's cool to go through.

126
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,840
- Thanks.
- Hi.

127
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,480
What's up with that?

128
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,160
What's up, my Main D?

129
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,240
Yo, Sexy,
what's going on, boy?

130
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,200
Man, it's cracking out here.

131
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,680
Check that out.

132
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,640
- Yeah!
- Oh, my goodness!

133
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,080
Talkin' to me!

134
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,320
Yeah?

135
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,400
Imagine she was like us--

136
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,760
just wanted to fuck,
you know what I'm saying?

137
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,000
Right here, right now.
Why can't women think like that?

138
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,000
Sometimes a man
got to get his fuck on

139
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,040
without love getting
in the way of it, that's all I'm saying.

140
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,800
Can I get an amen up in here?

141
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,560
- Amen.
- That's what I'm talking about.

142
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,920
Now, I'm sure that my man Sean
feels the same way, right?

143
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,200
- Yes.
- Huh?

144
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,040
- Yes.
- Get the hell out of here!

145
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,240
Why you trying
to do that to me?

146
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,200
Hey, dog, his girl
got him whipped, dog, for real.

147
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,160
- Oh, you're not whipped?
- No. I'm peeping right now.

148
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,480
You still got the game?
Candice!

149
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,400
No, no, I'm just joking.

150
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,560
We're having a debate about
the survival of the species--

151
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,880
You're having a what?

152
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,920
Both of y'all whipped!
Look at y'all!

153
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,080
What are you guys
talking about?

154
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,120
You see what I'm talking about?

155
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,360
All changed!

156
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,480
Want to help out your pops?

157
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,280
Give me--

158
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:49,240
D.E.A., punk. Don't move,
bitch, or I'll blast you!

159
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,720
No, that's enough of that.

160
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,080
Don't be teaching her that
funky armlock and curse words.

161
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,120
What?
I didn't make her do it.

162
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,040
Hicks taught her that, not me.

163
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:05,480
- You didn't teach her that?
- I just taught her to--

164
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:09,960
- I love watching you with her.
- Do you?

165
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,360
You're so sweet.

166
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,120
Sounded rough to you?

167
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,440
Yeah. I know you taught her that.

168
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,320
I love you.

169
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,840
Want me to kick everyone out?

170
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,760
You read my mind.

171
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,720
- Who loves you?
- You.

172
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,320
<i>¿Que pasa, homes?</i>

173
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,360
What's up?

174
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,880
What do you think, homes?

175
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,880
What do I think?

176
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,200
Got equipment or what, man?

177
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,920
Good shit, man.

178
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:04,440
I think we should
let the games begin.

179
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,800
I'll take care of him.

180
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,960
I'm so proud of you, baby.

181
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,200
Who is it, baby?

182
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,720
Get down!

183
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,080
Stay down!

184
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,400
Fuck!

185
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,680
Hey!

186
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,080
Hey!

187
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,200
Hey, you fuck, you come
into my house while I sleep?

188
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,680
You can't kill Diablo.

189
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,080
What did you say?

190
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,760
You cannot kill Diablo.

191
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:30,320
Stace, call 9-1-1.

192
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,520
Get up.

193
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,520
Are you...?

194
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,160
Baby...

195
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,120
...I'm okay.

196
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,440
I got 'em. I protected you.

197
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,680
You okay?

198
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,120
- You hit?
- I am.

199
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,840
Honey?

200
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,360
I'm okay.

201
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,640
<i>9-1-1.</i>

202
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,600
All right, baby...

203
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,520
Hello?

204
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,880
...Iook at me.

205
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,920
<i>Sir?</i>

206
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,400
<i>What's the nature
of the emergency?</i>

207
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,080
I'm fine.

208
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,800
<i>What kind of assistance
do you require?</i>

209
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,240
I'm okay.

210
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,960
<i>I can't understand you, sir.
Can you speak up?</i>

211
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,880
Baby...

212
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,360
<i>Are you there, sir?</i>

213
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,920
It's all right.

214
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,560
Say hi to Uncle Sean.

215
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,560
Hi, Sean.

216
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,640
It's all right, dog.

217
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,200
Just rest.

218
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,840
Stacy.

219
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,800
Stacy.

220
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:07,960
Sean.

221
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:14,960
Sean.

222
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,280
Where's Stacy?

223
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,720
Where's my wife?

224
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,160
Look, man, um...

225
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,840
You've been out for a while.
You lost a lot of blood.

226
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,640
Where is she?

227
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,360
They buried her, Sean.

228
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,600
Where's my wife?

229
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:25,400
Calm down.
Calm down, now.

230
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,760
I've got you, man.

231
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,520
I've got you.

232
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,560
I'm here for you, man.

233
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:45,440
Fight on, man.
We'll take care of you.

234
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,440
Which one is it?

235
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,480
Right over there.

236
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:06,400
This prisoner is
in for two life sentences.

237
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,640
He's got nothing to lose,
but that doesn't matter.

238
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,040
You and I both know

239
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,440
who this guy is
and what he is capable of,

240
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,880
so you stay ten feet away
from him at all times,

241
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,920
and do not touch or threaten
the prisoner at any time.

242
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,360
- We clear?
- Clear. Open it up.

243
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,000
You've got five minutes.

244
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,320
You didn't expect
to see me again, did you?

245
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,720
Ten feet, Vetter!

246
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,120
- This good?
- Yeah.

247
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,360
You tried to have me killed...

248
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,360
...and you don't want
to talk to me?

249
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,080
That's okay. I have
all the time in the world.

250
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,120
Get him out of here!

251
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,240
You didn't think
I was gonna get to you?

252
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,360
Is that your family?

253
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,600
All right, fuck the talk.

254
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,600
Let me just ask you a question.

255
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,480
Did you kill my wife?

256
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,160
Did you kill my wife?

257
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,920
Answer me, motherfucker.

258
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,840
Answer the fucking question!

259
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,160
Vetter, step away
from the prisoner!

260
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,600
Vetter, damn it, I told you!

261
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,320
Get away from him.
Get away.

262
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,960
I was just
asking him for a smoke.

263
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,040
Get off me.

264
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,720
I got a smoke for you.

265
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,480
If I wanted you dead...

266
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,280
...you would be.

267
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,520
That's enough.
Let's go, Vetter.

268
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,960
Come on. Come on!

269
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:26,960
Come on!

270
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,240
Okay, okay, okay.

271
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,920
Come on, Vetter, let's move.

272
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,320
Come on.

273
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,600
<i>The order to hit my home
had to come from the top,</i>

274
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:51,160
<i>but to find that person,
you have to start at the bottom</i>

275

<i>Somewhere along the line,
someone will talk.</i>

277
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,600
- Yo, "T," what up?
- What's up with you?

278
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,680
Chillin', man.
Where Sexy at?

279
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,760
- In the house.
- Okay.

Yo, Big Sexy.

281

What's up, boy?

282
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,720
What's up with your D-Max?

283
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,640
- Chillin', dog.
- I'm glad you came.

I didn't know y'all was rolling.
Sean. What's up, man?

285
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:21,400
If you need a place to stay,
you are more than welcome.

286
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,680
All right?

287
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,320
Hey, man, we've got to
get at you about something.

288
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,800
So what's up?

289
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,680
We need to know who
out there moving major weight.

290
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,200
What kind of weight
y'all talking about?

291
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:35,880
Distribution level.
Some real shit.

292
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:38,040
Guys who are hooked up
with this new network.

293
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:41,480
Why you drinking out
the milk carton? Get a glass, man.

294
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,600
Damn!

295
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,800
Sexy, for real, man.

296
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,320
Talkin' about this weight,
we need to know who movin' it.

297
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,240
Those niggas
over in Ghost Town.

298
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:52,160
They movin' major weight
over by that church, man.

299
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,040
You still runnin' that dog?
You know, with your little dog?

300
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,720
I got the dog thing goin'.

301
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,440
Sean, I'm thinking
that could help us out.

302
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,600
You down with
hitting them fools up?

303
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:07,080
I don't care much about
them niggas on that side of town.

304
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,880
- Let's hit 'em up.
- Yeah, like tonight.

305
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,240
Cool.

306
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,680
I heard you came by the hospital.

307
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,480
Sorry, man.

308
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,760
I appreciate that.

309
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,160
That's cool.

310
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,800
I'm telling you, man,

311
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,760
we should have brought
the D.E.A. dogs out here.

312
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,520
Come on, D,
don't insult me like that.

313
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,800
Capone will sniff a roach
out of the ashtray

314
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,240
out of any damn car on the block,
you know what I'm talking about?

315
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,680
- Well, get to sniffin'.
- Chill, chill, chill.

316
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:46,000
- We ain't got all night.
- Come on, boy.

317
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,240
Go get 'em, boy.

318
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,680
Come on, Capone.

319
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,880
All right, cool.

320
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,560
Go on, baby.

321
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,920
What's taking so long?
We ain't got all night, man.

322
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,720
Yeah.

323
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,920
Ain't in that one.

324
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,080
Come on, Capone.

325
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,640
- He got it.
- You sure?

326
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:25,960
Yeah, I'm sure!

327
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,680
He got it, man.

328
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:40,600
Hey, wait a minute! Wait a minute!
What you call yourself doing?

329
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,320
This ain't your car!
You get away from here.

330
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,640
Easy, ma'am,
I'm just doing my job.

331
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,680
You assholes ain't got
nothing else to do

332
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:50,080
but come harass innocent,
hardworking citizens with this crap?

333
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,600
This is an honest,
blue-collar neighborhood.

334
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,480
Why don't you take your fat ass
up to the Palisades?

335
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,120
They could afford to pay
those $130 tow jobs.

336
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,760
This is an official impound.
It has five tickets.

337
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,960
My man, we got this.
Is this your vehicle?

338
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,800
It could be my vehicle.
Who are you supposed to be?

339
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:07,120
This is who I'm
supposed to be, right here.

340
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,680
Sexy, pop the trunk, man.

341
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,680
Dog, what you doin'?
Pop the trunk!

342
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,640
Hurry up!
Fuck is going on? Come on.

343
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,040
Damn!

344
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,640
Now, is that your shit?

345
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,800
Is this your car or not? Is it?

346
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,640
Come to think about it...

347
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,480
No. That's Monroe's car.

348
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:42,280
- Monroe?
- They call him Overdose.

349
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,680
- Where he stay?
- Right over there.

350
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:47,680
All right.
Go on back in the house.

351
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,000
Ain't got
enough time for this stuff.

352
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,440
Tow the car, nigga.

353
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,320
Yo, Sexy,
you've got to come here.

354
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,080
I ain't meetin' y'all
over here like this!

355
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:10,040
- Sexy, roll, man.
- Careful, man.

356
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,240
We got dope.

357
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,600
Aw, shit! Fuck!

358
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,360
"Diablo."

359
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,120
Fuck!

360
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,960
Hold your fire!
We're police officers!

361
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,480
Get the fuck out of my house!

362
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:16,240
- You got to chill!
- "Chill"? Fuck you!

363
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,080
You want me to chill
so you can ice me?

364
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,120
Fuck you!
Get the fuck out!

365
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:32,360
Yo, listen, I said
we're police officers, so relax.

366
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,920
We're here to help. That's all.

367
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,120
I'm coming up, all right?

368
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,840
Do your thing.
I'm reloading my shit.

369
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,800
Sean, hold your fire.

370
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,400
Now, look, man, I'm coming up,
so you've got to stop shooting.

371
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,520
Don't try nothing, homey.

372
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,480
Just take it easy, all right?

373
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,440
If we were the cleanup crew,

374
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,920
we would have finished you off
from down here, man.

375
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,040
Wouldn't be sticking my head
in here trying to get shot.

376
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,320
Just want to talk, all right?
Now, I'm coming up.

377
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,320
Slow.

378
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,200
I put my gun down, all right?

379
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,960
I know you scared.

380
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,240
I know you don't like the police--

381
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,520
Damn sure talking
to a police in an attic.

382
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:01,640
Back in the day,
I couldn't stand the police.

383
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,320
They used to fuck with us
all the time.

384
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,400
Me and my homies would be
rolling down the street.

385
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,840
They'd pull us over jackin' fools.

386
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,960
- You po-po.
- I know.

387
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,920
We used to complain that police
didn't do nothing for us.

388
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,640
And we was right, they didn't.

389
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:19,280
I got tired of complaining.
I made a choice.

390
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,800
I'm trying to help.

391
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:27,120
But what you doin', man,
you ain't helpin' us.

392
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,280
By the way things look downstairs,

393
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:34,440
you need to think about
getting into a whole 'nother game.

394
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,720
Only one alternative--
you put that gun down,

395
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,680
or my partner downstairs,
man, trust me,

396
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,600
he will take you out.

397
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:52,640
Now, do the right thing
and just put it down.

398
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,360
Since everything went down
with the big man,

399
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,480
shit has been major slow,
know what I'm sayin'?

400
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:09,240
He went up to,
like, $20,000 a ki.

401
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:12,320
I couldn't do nothing
with that, man.

402
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,240
This new dude was
supposed to hook me up--

403
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:18,680
- Who's this new dude?
- I don't know his name.

404
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:21,360
He contacted me, say he had
this, that, and the other.

405
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:25,560
He said he had kis for $14,000,
so I'm thinkin' everything's velvet.

406
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,200
- Right.
- But hell no.

407
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,360
Then this stupid motherfucker
gonna call me back,

408
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,080
telling me some shit about,
he want $20,000 a ki,

409
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,800
and I got to buy it?

410
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:36,680
I'm like, man, you stupid!
Who you think you talkin' to?

411
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,000
You kiss my ass.

412
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,520
- So what happened?
- What you mean?

413
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,480
Why you still alive
and your homies are dead?

414
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,960
I was in the attic.

415
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,280
- Doin' what?
- Hidin'.

416
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,160
What kind of coward shit
is that, man?

417
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,880
You see homey
in there in that chair

418
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,320
with his tongue
pulled through his neck?

419
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:54,560
You'd better get real.
Reflexes too slow.

420
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,520
Enough of the bullshit, dog.

421
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,720
The name--the new guy,
what is his name?

422
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,600
I ain't tellin' y'all shit else.
Nothin' else.

423
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,200
I'm cool with y'all.

424
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,840
These motherfuckers ain't no joke!

425
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:08,440
They would scalp me and send
my braids to my momma!

426
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,280
What y'all gonna do,
take me to jail?

427
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,080
Take me, then.
I'm cold anyway.

428
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,160
Give me a fuckin' coat.
Put me in the car.

429
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,320
We got us a hardhead right now.

430
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,760
- You sure about that?
- Actin' like you want to, man.

431
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,240
You're not gonna
tell us anything else?

432
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,320
Nothing else!

433
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:28,720
- You don't want to talk anymore?
- He ain't gonna talk.

434
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:31,560
You sure about that?

435
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,040
Here you go.

436
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:37,240
You think you a player
'cause you got an S600?

437
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:40,920
Not because of those
wack-ass dubs on that piece of shit.

438
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,640
Oh, yeah.

439
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:45,400
Does he think 'cause of this tatt
he's a gangster?

440
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,640
Get your hands off me.

441
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,400
Not 'cause of
the played-out platinum.

442
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,960
You don't think you're
crossing them over, do you?

443
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Back in the day,
I would have taken this from you.

444
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:57,200
You think you're a man because
you move a ki here and there.

445
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:00,480
That ain't weight! Did he think
that was weight in that piece of shit?

446
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:04,320
Let me tell you something--

447
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,720
the real motherfuckers
don't move a ki here and there.

448
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,040
They move
50 metric tons a month!

449
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,600
I'm gonna ask you--

450
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,360
Get your gun
out of my face, man.

451
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,880
Okay.

452
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,400
We'll do it like this.

453
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,720
Okay.

454
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:29,600
Now, I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

455
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,280
What's the name?

456
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,880
I don't know their name!
Hey, man!

457
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,840
I'm gonna ask you again.
What the fuck is his name?

458
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,160
Hey, man!

459
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,800
- What's up with your people?
- What's the fucking name?

460
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,720
I don't know, man!

461
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,520
Motherfucker named
Hollywood Jack, man!

462
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,280
Hollywood Jack, man.
My name Monroe Johnson.

463
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:53,600
I don't want no problems
with y'all, man.

464
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,560
The rest of the dope
in the gray Monte Carlo.

465
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:57,720
We got it, man. Come on.

466
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:04,400
We got ten pages on this thing,
all from the same number--

467
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:07,000
Soleil Tanning Salon.

468
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:08,880
Tanning salon?

469
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:11,040
You know damn well
you don't need no tan.

470
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:42,520
Whoa!

471
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:45,800
Slow down!

472
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:47,360
I think that's him.

473
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:48,920
<i>Looks Hollywood to me.</i>

474
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:00,560
<i>Yeah, that's definitely him.</i>

475
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:04,080
Ricky Martin, move over.
Here comes Hollywood Jack.

476
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:05,120
Hold on.

477
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,720
Yeah, we got you.

478
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,000
All right, I'm back.

479
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:11,560
Yeah, all right.

480
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,640
Yeah, I can do that for you.

481
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:15,120
Yeah, okay.

482
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,280
Yeah. Good-bye.

483
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:23,920
Hello. How's it going?

484
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,280
Good. Hey...

485
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:28,240
...how long has that clown
in the truck been out there?

486
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,000
I don't know.

487
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:44,040
<i>I'm gonna check him out.</i>

488
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:46,880
<i>- Just go easy, all right?
- I'm just gonna talk to him.</i>

489
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,600
Let's make this quick.

490
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:04,640
- I like this car.
- Hey, nice truck.

491
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:05,800
Thanks.

492
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:08,520
In fact, I was thinking
about trading this one in

493
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,440
for, like, seven of those.

494
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:11,720
Really?

495
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,960
I like it better than the S600.

496
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:18,080
Let me get your license
and registration, please.

497
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,800
May I ask what I did?

498
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,360
Yeah, your mud flaps.
You got no mud flaps on this.

499
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:26,560
It's a fuckin' Porsche.

500
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,480
You won't have to worry
when you trade it for the truck.

501
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:31,800
And you're parked
in a handicapped spot.

502
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:32,920
Did you know that?

503
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,080
Oh, really? No!

504
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,440
Aw, shit!

505
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:39,280
- You can get out of your car.
- Thank you.

506
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:43,960
<i>Beverly Hills dispatch.</i>

<i>Stand by.</i>

511
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:57,480
I said get out of the car.

512
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:58,840
This is fucking ridiculous!

513
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:00,440
When in the history of mankind

514
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:03,400
has anyone been harassed
for their fuckin' mud flaps?

515
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:04,920
Watch your language.

516
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,920
Oh, I'm sorry.
Let me rephrase.

517
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,480
Fuck you!

00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,280

I'm out, I'm out!

521
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,160
Damn! Chill, dog.

522
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:22,560
What does the name
Overdose mean to you?

523
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,960
- Over who?
- Overdose!

524
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,080
There's a human being
named Overdose?

525
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:28,360
Answer the fucking question.

<i>2-19-54.</i>

What the hell is a 2-1-9-5-4?

528
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:35,320
<i>Subject has
a warrant for jaywalking.</i>

529
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:37,120
Jaywalking?

530
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:41,000
Tell me why you paged
some drug trafficker ten times.

531
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:42,680
I didn't page anyone.

532
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:46,320
That's your salon, right?
The calls came from your salon.

533
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:50,040
Ninety percent of
my clients do narcotics,

534
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:52,120
and they all use that phone.

535
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,600
I don't know.

536
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:57,080
Why would Overdose
refer to you as his supplier?

537
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:58,840
You're Hollywood Jack,
aren't you?

538
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:02,360
- Come again?
- Hollywood Jack.

539
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:06,200
My civil rights are being violated
'cause some jig drug dealer

540
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:09,120
named Overkill or Oreo
or whatever the fuck his name is

541
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,320
mentioned a guy
named Hollywood Jack?

542
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:16,200
Call my lawyer, you cocksucker!

543
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:18,360
Call your lawyer?

544
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:20,600
God!

545
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:23,520
Can you guys see this?

546
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:26,120
You don't know who that is?
I'll call your lawyer.

547
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:29,040
I'll beat the shit out of him
after I beat the fuck out of you!

548
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:30,840
What the fuck
does Overdose mean to you?

549
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:32,760
What are you doing, man?
You've got to chill.

550
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:34,360
Damn! Chill, boy!

551
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:37,360
Get the fuck back in the car!

552
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,280
What's wrong with you, man?
People could be videotaping!

553
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:40,560
Chill out!

554
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,240
Get back in the car, man!

555
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,920
All we got on this guy
is a warrant for jaywalking.

556
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,520
That's it.

557
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:49,200
That's all we got--
a fuckin' jaywalking ticket!

558
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:52,360
Yo, Hollywood, how'd you know
Overdose is black?

559
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:53,720
What?

560
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:56,440
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but you called him a "jig," right?

561
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:59,160
Don't stupid fucks like you
call black people "jigs"?

562
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:01,480
You fucked up.

563
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:05,680
My lawyer is gonna have
a field day with you, psycho fuck!

564
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:08,760
Your lawyer?
I'll strike him, too!

565
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:11,920
Is there a problem?

566
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:13,840
Get back in the fuckin' salon.

567
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:15,880
Everything's okay.
Everything's fine.

568
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:17,680
Can I help you with something?

569
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:20,560
Get in your truck, man!
Everything is fine.

570
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:22,600
Get the fuck
in the truck, man. Damn!

571
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:42,920
Hey, sleepyhead!

572
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,720
What the fuck, homey?

573
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:46,640
I just want--whoa!

574
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:48,560
I was crashed out, man.

575
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,960
I'm sorry, man.
I just wanted to ask a question.

576
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,840
Could I get a beer or something?

577
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:56,800
Yeah, get a beer, man.

578
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:57,800
Okay.

579
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:59,680
What were you doing
down at the salon

580
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:03,080
paging some ghetto rat's
crack pad, like, ten times?

581
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:04,520
I fucked up.

582
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:07,200
Oh, no, hey, fuck it.
Don't worry about it.

583
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,960
It's no big deal.

584
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,880
But...

585
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:14,400
what is a big deal is,
I spent my afternoon with cops--

586
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,760
specifically, the cop
you were supposed to take out.

587
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,120
Stupid ass.

588
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:03,400
When I was little...

589
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:08,200
...my brothers and sisters and me...

590
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:11,240
...we all slept in the same room.

591
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:15,840
There was no electricity,
dirt floors.

592
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:18,120
When it would rain...

593
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:23,720
...we couldn't sleep 'cause
the raindrops on the tin roof

594
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,880
were too loud.

595
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:28,920
What did you
call me down here for?

596
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,400
I might be able to help you.

597
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:34,920
You had your chance to talk to me.

598
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:42,880
They killed my wife...

599
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:47,360
...and my son.

600
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:04,360
When there's a change at the top,

601
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:08,600
they start over,
build their own pipeline.

602
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:11,720
They'll be looking for new buyers.

603
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:15,720
So if you could come up
with enough money,

604
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:18,040
you'll flush him out.

605
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:23,960
I can't do anything about him,
but you can.

606
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:30,720
Romans.

607
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:10,280
Come on, baby, slide over here!

608
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:23,200
We've been hurting for product

609
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:25,280
ever since these fuckers
took down the sale.

610
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:29,440
And you hear all this
stupid shit about Diablo.

611
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,200
I don't want any part of Diablo.

612
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:33,760
I just need to get
back to business.

613
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:36,480
Diablo's been pulling
some bold fuckin' moves.

614
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:38,000
He's been clipping
the lower-level guys,

615
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:39,280
cutting 'em clean out.

616
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:41,680
Bam! Gone!
Streamlinin' the pipeline.

617
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:44,840
Now, with us, they've got to
walk on eggshells.

618
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:47,120
They fuck with us,
they got problems in the jails.

619
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:50,240
We'll kick their wetback ass
in every jail in the state.

620
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:52,440
It's like
an insurance policy for 'em--

621
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:55,040
we get Central and NorCal,
they get SoCal. Simple.

622
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:57,760
Don't worry about us.
We don't deal with California.

623
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:58,920
Right.

624
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:09,680
You're looking at a shipment
like that every month.

625
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:15,480
He can do 18 per.

626
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:17,440
Eighteen? You gotta be
kidding me, man.

627
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,600
- What?
- You're wasting my time.

628
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:23,600
All right, all right. Wait up.

629
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:26,320
- Sixteen.
- Sixteen?

630
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:28,280
I can't believe I just said that.

631
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:31,320
- Who pays them prices, cops?
- You got some nuts on you.

632
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,560
You want to do business
with me or not?

633
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:37,080
Aw, fuck, man,
you're killing me here.

634
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:40,360
All right, look, we can do fifteen.

635
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:43,520
You know how fuckin' tight
it's been around here.

636
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:46,600
Anything less than fifteen,
I'm cuttin' my own throat!

637
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:55,040
We could do fifteen.

638
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,000
All right. Jesus!

639
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:59,880
Hey, guys.
Want a dance, honey?

640
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:01,360
No, thanks.

641
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:06,120
Joe, buy him a dance.
We need to loosen him up.

642
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:09,680
He's so...serious.

643
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,560
Get the fuck off my lap.

644
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:15,480
Fuck you!

645
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:26,480
