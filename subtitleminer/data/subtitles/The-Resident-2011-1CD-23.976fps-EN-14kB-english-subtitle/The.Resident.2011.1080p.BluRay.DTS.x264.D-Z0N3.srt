1
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,005
It's about that time, man.

2
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:32,943
Here.

3
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:34,319
Let's go. Bay one.

4
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,029
That's a pulse.

5
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,990
Code three.

6
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:41,577
It's an involuntary admission, okay?

7
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:44,913
Okay, we're gonna intubate this guy.

8
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,456
And fix the hole in his heart.

9
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,518
Got it.

10
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,440
Looks tight.
Pressure's holding.

11
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:14,193
Okay, call CT Surgery, tell them
they got a sick one coming up.

12
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,259
Here you are, Natasha,
right over my shoulder.

13
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:40,719
I certainly am.

14
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:43,138
Natasha, is you?

15
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:46,308
Boris, how could you
mistake me for a possum?

16
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,310
I help it if you
put on weight?

17
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:38,443
Where's the bedroom?

18
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:40,529
This is your bedroom.

19
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:44,157
And your kitchen, your
dining room, your study.

20
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,451
It is real
New York living.

21
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:48,704
And there's a bonus.
The view is amazing.

22
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,289
Go ahead.

23
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,044
This is a great view?

24
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,337
Interested?

25
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,507
Hello?

26
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:55,896
Excuse me?

27
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,527
Hi.

28
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,863
Um, someone called
about a rental here?

29
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:07,324
It's not ready yet.

30
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:09,951
Well, could I see it?

31
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,289
You're looking at it.

32
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,708
Oh.

33
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,377
I can't afford this.

34
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:19,544
It's thirty-eight.

35
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:21,755
What?

36
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,590
The place,
it's thirty-eight.

37
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:25,092
Thousand?

38
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,095
Thirty-eight hundred.

39
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,933
Wait, what's the catch?

40
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:35,310
Are you putting a nightclub
down on the first floor?

41
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,978
Well, utilities
would be separate.

42
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,980
It takes a lot to heat
a place like this.

43
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,817
So, expect Con Ed to stick
it to you in the wintertime.

44
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,568
Right.

45
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,987
This would be the best
view in the building.

46
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,283
Are you the super?

47
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:52,411
Owner, actually.

48
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,246
Oh. Right.

49
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,706
My family bought
the building in the '40s.

50
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,583
And to answer your question

51
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:01,211
no, there is no nightclub.

52
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:03,255
A lot of my tenants
started to move out

53
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:05,173
and so I'm renovating
the apartments.

54
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,092
Until then, it could get
a little noisy around here.

55
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:10,679
I don't- I don't mind
noise. I'm an ER doctor, so-

56
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:13,181
When we sleep,
we really sleep.

57
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:19,146
Well, a couple things
about the building, uh

58
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,522
it doesn't get the best
cell phone reception.

59
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:24,234
Okay, I'll- I can
figure that out.

60
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,615
And there's
the F Line.

61
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,784
- Jesus.
- Yeah.

62
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,953
There's a maintenance track that
runs directly under this building.

63
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:38,331
Usually at night.

64
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:42,669
All right, I'm gonna need your Social
Security number and three references.

65
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:45,797
Oh, I can get you all of that,
including records of my taxes...

66
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,507
...for the last five years, if you'd like.

67
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:48,717
I prefer no pets.

68
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:49,801
Of course.

69
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,386
All right.

70
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:55,474
The heaters bang
loudly in the morning.

71
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:56,308
You haven't checked
my references.

72
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:58,101
I will.

73
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:00,979
Take a look around. I'm
gonna get back to work.

74
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:12,282
I gotta be uptown
in exactly 100 minutes

75
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:14,868
so you got 60 to get the
shit out of this rented truck

76
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:16,286
or I gotta charge you
for another day.

77
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,330
Take a deep breath, I don't want
you to strain yourself talking.

78
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:21,124
What, did you hire the only moving guy in
New York who doesn't actually move furniture?

79
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,083
Yeah, right?

80
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,303
Well, you travel
pretty light.

81
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:35,472
Oh, I got rid
of a lot.

82
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:40,185
I would have liked to have sawed
the bed in half and burned it

83
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:42,854
but I need a place
to sleep at night.

84
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:45,607
Well-

85
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:48,026
Not easy at forgiving.

86
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:52,030
Change is good.

87
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,532
Should we go get
that mattress?

88
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:02,958
Hi.

89
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:07,379
This is, uh, my grandfather.
August, Juliet. Juliet, August.

90
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:08,964
She's our new tenant.

91
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,633
Hi.

92
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:12,634
Got any pets?

93
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,052
No.

94
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:16,096
Are you loud?

95
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,722
No, not at all.

96
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,307
Sorry I scared you.

97
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:22,060
Nice to meet you.

98
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,142
Max?

99
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,355
Max?

100
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,289
Oh.

101
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,892
Fuck you!

102
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:54,475
It's crystal meth.

103
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,894
Stop it!

104
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,395
It's all right,
it's all right.

105
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:58,646
Don't do anything.

106
00:14:58,731 --> 00:14:59,981
It's going to be alright.

107
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:02,483
No! Don't touch me!

108
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:03,735
It's gonna be fine.

109
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,112
No.

110
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:07,071
You're gonna
be all right.

111
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,574
Oh, my God.

112
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,913
Hey.

113
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:16,789
Heard you had
a long one.

114
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:20,251
M m. That was
an insane day.

115
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,795
Rob and I are going out
today, you want to come?

116
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,799
No, thanks. I think I'm just
gonna go home and get to bed early.

117
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:32,597
You have got to stop
thinking about him.

118
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:37,435
The love of my life cheated
on me. I n my own bed.

119
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,271
Every time I look at myself all I
see is someone who wasn't enough.

120
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,690
You were enough.
You are enough.

121
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:47,028
More than enough.
He's an asshole.

122
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:48,613
I gave up my dream

123
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:50,281
to move to New York
City to be his

124
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,200
and he just
threw it all away.

125
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:57,038
It's an art opening.
It's not gonna kill you.

126
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,499
And you're going.

127
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,585
We can handle this, it's
gonna cost you a little extra

128
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,795
'cause of all
the unused space.

129
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:07,882
Grandfather doesn't want to change
the integrity of the structure.

130
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,134
OK. No problem.
We'll take care of it.

131
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:12,845
All right,
thank you.

132
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:14,722
Hey.

133
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:15,390
Hi.

134
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,724
About to start making
a lot of noise?

135
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,559
If I can get
the city's approval.

136
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,312
There are a lot of "l"s to dot
and "T"s to cross around here.

137
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:22,647
Yeah, I bet.

138
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:24,649
Oh! Thank you
for the gift.

139
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:27,527
It was so kind and,
and really thoughtful.

140
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,030
The gift that was
outside my door yesterday?

141
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,324
Yeah, that uh,
that wasn't me.

142
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,742
August.

143
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,162
Oh, there you are.

144
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:42,333
Hi. I wanted to thank you for
the incredibly thoughtful gift.

145
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:45,003
I'm just putting myself in your shoes.

146
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,380
I thought,
"If I were a woman

147
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:50,341
"alone, in a new apartment

148
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,844
"surrounded by strangers

149
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:54,429
what would I want?"

150
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:01,019
I don't get much company.

151
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:06,983
Oh, l- I'm sorry.
L- I should really go.

152
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:08,860
Thanks.

153
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:18,036
Great.

154
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:19,829
Oh, excuse me.

155
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:20,663
Max?

156
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:21,497
Hey.

157
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:23,207
Hey, I didn't recognize you
outside of the building.

158
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:24,208
- Who's this?
- You, too.

159
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,918
Oh, this is Max.

160
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,754
This is Sidney,
we work together.

161
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,255
Very nice
to meet you, Sidney.

162
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:30,882
Nice to meet you,
too, Max.

163
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:32,467
I haven't
heard about you.

164
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,635
Hm... Nice day,
isn't it?

165
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,056
It is. Um, you know, sometimes I
feel like all I ever do is work.

166
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,517
And, I don't know, I just
thought I'd stop and come out

167
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:43,811
and feel Brooklyn, you know?

168
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,021
Yeah.

169
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:47,440
Well, Max, would you like
to have a drink with us?

170
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:50,068
No. No, thanks. I'm actually
getting ready to leave.

171
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,945
It was very nice
to meet you.

172
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:53,863
Great to see you.

173
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:54,739
You, too, Max.

174
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,950
Shh! He's my landlord.

175
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:58,826
So?

176
00:17:58,911 --> 00:17:59,911
And I'm his tenant.

177
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:01,579
Oh, meh. You mean like
what if it sucks

178
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:02,914
and you can't get away
from each other?

179
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:04,290
Yeah. It's not recommended.

180
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:05,249
So you thought
about it?

181
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:06,501
Shh!

182
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:07,418
Hey, Max?

183
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:08,669
Hey.

184
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,338
Um, do you, actually

185
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:11,631
do you mind
walking me home?

186
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:13,382
I'd love to.

187
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:14,425
Great. Okay.

188
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,301
Bye.

189
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:16,594
See ya.

190
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:17,929
He's cute.

191
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:19,430
Thanks.

192
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,183
Bye, you guys.

193
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,101
Bye-bye.

194
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:30,817
August, uh, he worries
about me, you know?

195
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:36,030
People from his generation were married
with ten kids by the time they were my age.

196
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,449
Yeah, he is kind of
a unique guy, isn't he?

197
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,284
That's- That's
one way to put it.

198
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:42,954
Unique. Uh, difficult.

199
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:45,915
Pain in the ass would be
another way to characterize him.

200
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,875
Is he okay?

201
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,377
Well, up until
a year ago

202
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:52,463
we were partners in the building.
We did everything together.

203
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:56,050
Fixed everything together,
made all the decisions together

204
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,969
and then
he had a stroke.

205
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:02,014
Oh. What about
your parents?

206
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:06,435
They, uh, they, they died when
I was, when I was very young.

207
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,814
What about, uh, what about your family?

208
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:14,986
Um. Let's see, my parents, they're
kind of, uh, after-the-fact hippies.

209
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,864
I guess that makes you the
black sheep of the family, huh?

210
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:20,116
Definitely. Yeah.

211
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,202
For me, uh, rebellion was
going through med school.

212
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:25,329
Free love sucked,
as far as I could tell.

213
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:27,498
It led to a quick divorce
on my parents' part

214
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,168
so I was every other
weekend with my dad.

215
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:33,337
I never really knew
where my home was

216
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,548
not until Jack and I
moved in together.

217
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:36,757
Jack?

218
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:37,758
My ex.

219
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:39,552
Yeah.

220
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:46,809
So I thought all
hippie kids had weird names.

221
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,519
Oh, you do,
don't you?

222
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,229
What's your
real name?

223
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:51,564
Juliet. It's
my real name.

224
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:53,691
What's your
middle name?

225
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:55,193
Wanna sit here?

226
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:56,944
Are you ignoring
my question?

227
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:58,613
No.

228
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,449
No, I just thought
we'd take in the view.

229
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:04,619
Uh-huh. Okay.

230
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:19,217
When I was little, um, I used to
walk around the neighborhood at night.

231
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:21,469
And look into windows

232
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,930
at families
around televisions

233
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:28,392
brothers, sisters, parents,
meeting, you know, talking.

234
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:33,064
And, um, you know, I
knew I couldn't have that.

235
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:35,733
But, just watching them

236
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:39,487
it somehow made me feel
like I was part of it.

237
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,575
Seeing all these
families, it's sweet.

238
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:48,037
Yeah. Yeah.

239
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:51,749
Bliss.

240
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,252
Bliss?

241
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:54,752
Yep.

242
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:57,171
Oh, my Jesus.

243
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:00,883
"Dr. Bliss."

244
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:03,177
Doctor Bliss.

245
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:05,346
Yep.

246
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,598
Very nice.

247
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,502
Thank you.

248
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:44,969
Sorry.

249
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:46,137
No, don't be
sorry, Juliet.

250
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:48,639
God, I'm an idiot.
Of course it's a bad idea.

251
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,558
That's- That's
not what I meant.

252
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:54,186
I'm just confused.

253
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:56,647
Reading the wrong signals.

254
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:40,186
Jesus Christ, Juliet.
Calm the fuck down.

255
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:07,546
I don't know
what I was expecting.

256
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:11,258
You were expecting
rebound sex, honey.

257
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:17,056
Hot. Landlord.
Rebound. Sex.

258
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,058
You're crazy.

259
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:20,017
See you later.

260
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:21,727
Bye, girl.

261
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:31,946
Jack.

262
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,239
You picked up.

263
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:36,617
What do you want?

264
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:39,203
I just called to say hi.

265
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:42,581
Well, hi.

266
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:46,877
Can I see you?

267
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:49,672
Juliet-
I'm sorry.

268
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:53,634
I gotta go.

269
00:25:57,138 --> 00:26:00,224
Look, I don't think it's a
good idea for us to talk yet.

270
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:02,560
Juliet. It's Max.

271
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:03,477
Max?

272
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,396
Listen.

273
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,274
Um. I'm sorry
about yesterday.

274
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:10,568
Well, I was wondering if

275
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:14,446
I could make it up to you
with, with dinner tonight?

276
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:22,413
You like old things.

277
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:24,832
I suppose I do.

278
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:29,587
You know, I'm not really one of
the text message, Twitter crowd.

279
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:34,008
Technology seems to be about telling
everybody your deep, dark secrets.

280
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:38,345
And, uh, I don't know, I guess I
think secrets should be secrets.

281
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:42,766
What?

282
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,563
It's just-

283
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:49,523
It's starting to feel like home.

284
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,442
Safe.

285
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:54,737
Warm. I nviting.

286
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:56,947
You did that for me.

287
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:02,661
Good.

288
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:06,248
So what's your secret?

289
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:08,959
Why aren't you married?

290
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:14,715
I guess I just never
found anyone that-

291
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,468
Anyone that?

292
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:23,057
That got me, I guess.

293
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:24,224
Or that I got.

294
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:28,228
And the truth is, um

295
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,648
I'm not very social.

296
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:33,150
You know, it's probably
the way I, I grew up.

297
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:37,488
You know, I spent my whole life
taking care of my family's building

298
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,823
and recently,
my grandfather.

299
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:42,159
And because of that, I just

300
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:44,745
I never had a
relationship that mattered.

301
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:50,501
You know, going to that, that
art opening thing the other day

302
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:53,879
That was- That was
a big deal for me.

303
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:55,631
I'm sorry about that day.

304
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:57,091
No.

305
00:27:57,175 --> 00:28:00,469
No, I was just
surprised that

306
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:02,763
that you-

307
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:04,515
That I what?

308
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:08,185
That you wanted to kiss me.

309
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:10,938
Why wouldn't I?

310
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:18,404
Landlord.

311
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:20,197
Tenant.

312
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:23,200
Messy.

313
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:14,126
That's a pulse!

314
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:37,357
He thought he was dying.
It's another stroke, isn't it?

315
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:40,736
I called in a scrip for Klonopin.
He should see a psychiatrist.

316
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:44,072
Are you okay?

317
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:47,367
Yeah.

318
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:15,395
Someone called
about a rental here?

319
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:49,096
Excuse me.

320
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:49,847
Max?

321
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:50,430
Hey.

322
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:50,931
Hi.

323
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:52,266
Who's this?

324
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:55,310
Oh, this is Max. This is
Sidney, we work together.

325
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:57,688
Sometimes I feel like
all I do is work, and, um

326
00:30:57,772 --> 00:30:59,064
I don't know,
I decided to stop

327
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:02,276
and come out and
feel Brooklyn, you know?

328
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,110
Yeah.

329
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:04,528
Hey, Max,
do you actually

330
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:06,238
do you mind
walking me home?

331
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:35,142
Sorry. I'm confused.
Reading the wrong signals.

332
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:02,294
Sorry. God, I'm an idiot.

333
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:07,007
Of course, it's a bad idea.

334
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:10,010
I'm confused.

335
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:11,553
Reading the wrong signals.

336
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:40,017
Jesus Christ, Juliet.
Calm the fuck down.

337
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:13,693
Max?

338
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,779
What?

339
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:17,781
Max.

340
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:20,158
I can't do this.

341
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:21,576
Max.

342
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:23,120
I can't do this.

343
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:25,747
I can't get him out of my mind.

344
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:28,917
Jack.

345
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:31,461
I still only know his smell.

346
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:34,422
And the way he touches me, l-

347
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:37,425
I don't want it to be like this.

348
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:42,764
I understand.

349
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:47,477
Yeah, yeah, you understand, right?

350
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:55,068
I'll call you later.

351
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,903
Okay.

352
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:56,630
I know everything
that goes on in this building.

353
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:59,633
I know everything
that goes on in your head.

354
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:03,970
You think I don't know
how your brain works?

355
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:07,807
Just like your father.

356
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:10,727
Jealous and perverted.

357
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:12,520
That's enough.

358
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:17,525
Your mother.

359
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,736
She was beautiful.

360
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:25,492
She married a weak man.

361
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:29,120
Then she gave birth to another.

362
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:55,105
Hey.

363
00:37:57,733 --> 00:38:00,110
Um. L-I've been meaning
to talk to you.

364
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:02,487
Yeah. Look,
I'm- I'm sorry.

365
00:38:02,571 --> 00:38:04,281
It suddenly felt weird, l-

366
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:06,324
It had nothing
to do with you, I just-

367
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:08,702
I need more time.

368
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:09,828
That's okay.

369
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:13,373
You know, that, that tells me you
take being with someone seriously.

370
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:15,500
And, you know, I like that.

371
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:21,047
Um, but, you know, I,
I was thinking about it

372
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:24,551
and maybe we shouldn't have
done that, you know?

373
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:26,303
Meaning that we live in
the same building, and all.

374
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:27,804
Really?

375
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:30,473
No offense, I just-

376
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,058
I just needed company, I guess.

377
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,394
I'm so glad you feel the same way.

378
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,313
I just-

379
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:42,193
It's meant a lot to me
the last couple weeks.

380
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:44,321
Well, l-
I should go, l-

381
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:46,489
Yeah. Okay.

382
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:48,867
Okay. I'll see you.

383
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:50,243
Have- Have a nice day.

384
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,078
You, too.

385
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:03,298
What's the matter with you?

386
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:09,429
Why didn't you
stand up for yourself?

387
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:12,515
Just like your father.

388
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,727
Your mother, she was beautiful.

389
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:19,856
She married a weak man.

390
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:25,695
Then she gave birth to another.

391
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:40,473
Oh.

392
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:42,767
This place is driving me crazy.

393
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:51,734
And I thought I knew everything
about this building.

394
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:54,320
I never realized your kitchen
had an old wine closet.

395
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:55,405
Hm...

396
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:57,240
August's old place had, uh

397
00:42:57,324 --> 00:42:59,576
had one of these, but, uh, this

398
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,828
they must've covered
this up years ago.

399
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:04,122
Well, I think it's really cool.
Can I use it?

400
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:06,332
Yeah. Absolutely. Um.

401
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,334
Why don't I just fix it up for
you and I'll get out of your hair.

402
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:09,586
Well, I have work.

403
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:11,170
That's, that's okay.

404
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:14,173
I can, I can do it
while you're gone.

405
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:16,259
That's really sweet of you.

406
00:43:16,343 --> 00:43:18,469
Thanks for being
such a good friend.

407
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:56,025
Hi. Hi, no, let me
help you with this.

408
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:56,943
Oh, no.
That's okay.

409
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:58,986
No, no, no.
I should help you.

410
00:44:59,071 --> 00:44:59,904
That- It's sweet.

411
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:02,782
Uh, it goes,
it goes in the kitchen?

412
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:03,866
Yeah.

413
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:06,786
Okay, good. Yeah.

414
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,454
Got a lot of stuff.

415
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:14,794
You, uh, you cooking?

416
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:16,462
Yeah.

417
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:20,133
Maybe I'll, uh, I'll
stay and help, yeah?

418
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:22,093
You, you
- You don't have to do that.

419
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:30,143
Uh, Juliet,
I wanted to

420
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:32,645
I wanted to try to speak to
you about, about something.

421
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:35,815
Um, it's been a little
confusing for me

422
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:38,192
because you, because
you kissed me first.

423
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:39,819
What?

424
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:41,654
Yeah, you made
the first move.

425
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:44,073
You kissed me first
and, um

426
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:48,244
and now you're acting
like nothing happened.

427
00:45:48,328 --> 00:45:50,496
I'm sorry, l-

428
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:53,833
Um, we were just getting
to know each other.

429
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:56,335
You know, seeing if things
worked or, or didn't.

430
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,629
I mean, that's what,
that's what people do.

431
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:02,675
I don't do that.

432
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:10,266
You shouldn't
do that, either.

433
00:46:40,005 --> 00:46:42,256
Hey.

434
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:45,802
Yeah. Ten minutes
is perfect.

435
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:47,929
All right,
I'll see you then.

436
00:46:48,013 --> 00:46:49,847
Bye.

437
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:03,921
Hey.

438
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:05,506
Oh!

439
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:08,384
Amelie, hi! I missed you so much.

440
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:11,679
Hi.

441
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:12,930
Uh-

442
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:14,807
What happened
to her?

443
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:17,393
She's been picking a fight
with a German shepherd at, um-

444
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:18,978
Oh?

445
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:19,896
Yeah. I didn't
know what to bring

446
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,272
to a dinner
like this, but-

447
00:48:21,356 --> 00:48:24,442
Thank you,
they're beautiful.

448
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:27,695
Let's sit here,
in the living room.

449
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:29,113
Place is huge.

450
00:48:29,197 --> 00:48:30,406
And cheap.

451
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:31,991
How much?

452
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:33,910
Thirty-eight hundred.

453
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:37,580
Anything available
for me?

454
00:48:37,664 --> 00:48:40,750
I don't know if we're
quite ready for that.

455
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:43,044
Right.

456
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:46,047
Thanks.

457
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:56,766
Tell me about
the German Shepherd.

458
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:58,768
She's been having a hard
time at doggy day care.

459
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:04,774
Why are you taking
her to doggy day care?

460
00:49:04,858 --> 00:49:06,525
Been traveling a lot
the past few weeks.

461
00:49:09,988 --> 00:49:11,489
It was business.

462
00:49:11,573 --> 00:49:13,074
I wasn't thinking that.

463
00:49:13,158 --> 00:49:14,283
Look, I could
tell you everything.

464
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:15,493
I don't want to know.

465
00:49:15,577 --> 00:49:20,247
You were never home.
I literally never saw you.

466
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:25,127
Please don't tell me you slept with
someone else because I work too hard.

467
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:28,589
I was with someone else.

468
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:34,845
It was just a flirtation, but
it felt amazing for a moment.

469
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:38,641
I want to be clear
about something.

470
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:41,852
He was nice
but he was never you.

471
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:44,230
It's the guy
with the beard, right?

472
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:47,817
How do you know that?

473
00:49:47,901 --> 00:49:50,903
I followed you one night. I
was gonna ring your bell, but-

474
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:52,989
You followed me home?

475
00:49:53,031 --> 00:49:56,826
I wasn't good anymore.

476
00:49:56,910 --> 00:50:00,663
My life, without you

477
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:03,040
I missed you.

478
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:16,929
I missed you,
too, Jack.

479
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:18,848
I'm sorry.

480
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:50,356
I'm sorry
dinner burned.

481
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,691
I'm not.

482
00:51:58,698 --> 00:51:59,990
I want you to stay.

483
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:03,202
I can't. I've got
a 7:00 AM.

484
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:07,998
I'm in no way prepared.
I'm gonna be up all night.

485
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:11,460
You want to keep
Amelie tonight?

486
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:13,462
No pets allowed.

487
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:15,673
Here, keep this.

488
00:52:16,716 --> 00:52:18,217
I love you.

489
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:21,053
All right, come on.

490
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:22,972
Bye.

491
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:02,965
So what's going on? I
heard you were late again.

492
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:05,968
Yeah, I slept through my
alarm three times in two weeks.

493
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:07,219
And I
never oversleep.

494
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:08,804
So, you been
out late?

495
00:55:08,888 --> 00:55:10,514
No, no.
There's just-

496
00:55:10,598 --> 00:55:13,225
There's something creepy
about my apartment.

497
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:17,062
A guy gives you a gorgeous
apartment, at an unbelievable price

498
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:20,482
cooks for you, and is an absolute
gentleman, and that's creepy?

499
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:22,735
No, no. There's just
something about it.

500
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:23,444
I can't wake up
in the morning

501
00:55:23,528 --> 00:55:26,113
and I don't know-
It's- it's a feeling.

502
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:30,200
If I were you,
I'd keep the apartment

503
00:55:30,285 --> 00:55:31,785
get a louder alarm.

504
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:43,297
So the record feature's
triggered by movement.

505
00:55:43,381 --> 00:55:45,841
So any activity
in your apartment

506
00:55:45,884 --> 00:55:48,552
will be recorded in up
to ten-minute intervals.

507
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:54,141
It's a wireless system which can
be accessed through your computer.

508
00:55:54,225 --> 00:55:57,019
This position, and the
position in the living room

509
00:55:57,062 --> 00:55:59,980
will cover as much of
the apartment as possible.

510
00:56:00,065 --> 00:56:04,943
But that still leaves the kitchen
and the bathroom uncovered.

511
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:07,988
That's okay. As long as I have
the front door and my bedroom.

512
00:56:08,073 --> 00:56:09,573
Well, you got that.

513
00:56:16,122 --> 00:56:20,292
These things have automatic night vision,
so you've no need to leave a light on.

514
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:22,711
These babies will catch
anything that moves.

515
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:25,839
So, you gonna sublet?

516
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:27,758
I'm sorry, what?

517
00:56:27,842 --> 00:56:29,802
Most people put these in
if they're going to sublet

518
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:33,222
or have a party,
or even for babysitters.

519
00:56:33,306 --> 00:56:35,557
You know, so nobody
steals anything.

520
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:36,934
I'm gonna sublet.

521
00:56:37,018 --> 00:56:39,061
Here we go.

522
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:52,241
Well, that's it.

523
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:56,912
So, um, call if you
have any questions.

524
00:56:56,996 --> 00:56:58,580
Thanks.

525
00:58:22,957 --> 00:58:24,166
Grandfather?

526
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:26,793
Max?

527
00:58:26,878 --> 00:58:28,754
What're you doing?

528
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:31,381
It's my life now.

529
00:59:23,851 --> 00:59:24,726
I'm sorry
to rush.

530
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:29,731
Okay.

531
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:36,830
Hi. It's Juliet Devereau. I'm
sorry, I somehow seriously overslept-

532
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,712
I'll be there in, uh, ten.

533
01:05:16,495 --> 01:05:18,872
Uh, I need a TR on these, ASAP, please.

534
01:05:18,956 --> 01:05:19,748
Okay, got it.

535
01:05:19,832 --> 01:05:20,415
Thanks.

536
01:05:50,655 --> 01:05:53,615
Mr. Franklin, please return
to the emergency room.

537
01:06:32,446 --> 01:06:33,989
Ooh.

538
01:06:56,846 --> 01:06:57,846
Shit.

539
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:23,955
Thanks.

540
01:07:25,082 --> 01:07:27,125
This is Juliet.

541
01:07:27,209 --> 01:07:30,211
I faxed the toxicology
report you ordered.

542
01:07:30,296 --> 01:07:31,546
Great, thanks.

543
01:07:49,732 --> 01:07:52,233
Jack, don't go
to my apartment.

544
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:54,861
I don't know how the fuck
it happened, but somehow

545
01:07:54,945 --> 01:07:55,862
Shit.

546
01:08:10,252 --> 01:08:11,586
Jack?

547
01:10:35,648 --> 01:10:36,981
No.

548
01:10:50,287 --> 01:10:52,288
Juliet?

549
01:10:52,373 --> 01:10:53,706
Hi, there.

550
01:10:53,791 --> 01:10:56,167
You just get home?

551
01:10:57,086 --> 01:10:58,253
Yeah.

552
01:10:59,546 --> 01:11:01,673
Look what I found.

553
01:11:01,757 --> 01:11:06,386
This great old bottle of wine
from August's wine closet.

554
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:08,096
I'll, I'll open it.

555
01:11:08,138 --> 01:11:10,181
No, no need.
I already cracked it.

556
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:11,849
I wanted it to breathe
a little bit. Do you mind?

557
01:11:11,934 --> 01:11:13,268
No, that's great.

558
01:11:13,352 --> 01:11:16,312
You have a rough
day, Juliet?

559
01:11:18,482 --> 01:11:21,442
Yeah.

560
01:11:21,527 --> 01:11:24,153
Well, here. Drink this.
Maybe it will help.

561
01:11:24,238 --> 01:11:26,114
Thanks.

562
01:11:28,075 --> 01:11:30,118
Come sit down.

563
01:11:42,256 --> 01:11:44,549
So, to...

564
01:11:44,633 --> 01:11:48,136
to our friendship.

565
01:11:54,893 --> 01:11:56,311
Cheers.

566
01:12:04,069 --> 01:12:05,403
You're not
going to try it?

567
01:12:07,281 --> 01:12:09,157
I'm not, um-

568
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:12,368
Juliet, are you okay?

569
01:12:12,453 --> 01:12:16,622
Just, I'm exhausted. I'm
not really sleeping well.

570
01:12:21,086 --> 01:12:23,921
I like this wine a lot.

571
01:12:24,006 --> 01:12:26,257
It's good.

572
01:12:30,888 --> 01:12:33,264
I'll be right back.

573
01:12:42,941 --> 01:12:44,901
Juliet.

574
01:12:44,985 --> 01:12:47,070
Can you please
put your phone down?

575
01:12:47,154 --> 01:12:49,197
Just-

576
01:12:50,824 --> 01:12:53,910
Why are you calling him?

577
01:12:58,499 --> 01:12:59,540
Where is he?

578
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:04,921
Why did you give him
keys to my building?

579
01:13:07,132 --> 01:13:08,633
You know where he is?

580
01:13:08,717 --> 01:13:10,718
Why did you
betray me, Juliet?

581
01:13:10,761 --> 01:13:12,970
Sit. Down.

582
01:13:14,556 --> 01:13:16,933
I'm sorry.

583
01:13:17,017 --> 01:13:18,309
I'm sorry, Juliet.

584
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:19,977
What did you do to him?

585
01:13:20,062 --> 01:13:21,229
What did you do?

586
01:13:22,523 --> 01:13:24,273
Hey.

587
01:13:26,026 --> 01:13:27,276
Juliet.

588
01:13:27,361 --> 01:13:31,239
You're so beautiful.

589
01:13:31,323 --> 01:13:33,241
This time you get
to be awake.

590
01:13:33,325 --> 01:13:37,870
This time you get
to remember.

591
01:14:25,502 --> 01:14:26,210
Damn.

592
01:14:28,297 --> 01:14:34,844
Help!

593
01:14:42,436 --> 01:14:43,436
Come on!

594
01:15:26,605 --> 01:15:27,480
Hello?

595
01:15:31,401 --> 01:15:32,527
Hello?

596
01:15:34,279 --> 01:15:36,197
Hello? Hello?

597
01:16:21,577 --> 01:16:22,868
Oh!

598
01:18:03,095 --> 01:18:04,679
You bitch!

599
01:18:11,436 --> 01:18:12,978
God!

600
01:18:35,752 --> 01:18:38,003
Jesus Christ.

601
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:46,512
Juliet!

602
01:19:03,905 --> 01:19:05,990
There's nowhere for you to go.

603
01:22:19,601 --> 01:22:20,601
Juliet.

604
01:22:24,397 --> 01:22:26,190
I thought

605
01:22:26,274 --> 01:22:28,901
I thought you could pull me
out of these walls.

606
01:22:31,321 --> 01:22:34,198
I didn't want this.

607
01:22:34,282 --> 01:22:36,492
I didn't want this at all.

608
01:22:38,286 --> 01:22:39,787
I'm so sorry.

609
01:22:40,872 --> 01:22:43,457
I'm sorry.

610
01:22:43,541 --> 01:22:45,250
I was never gonna hurt you.

611
01:22:46,878 --> 01:22:48,379
But you fucking betrayed me!

612
01:23:10,485 --> 01:23:11,777
No.

613
01:23:20,996 --> 01:23:22,538
You bitch!

614
01:24:25,143 --> 01:24:27,686
Jack?
