1
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:23,143
I told you I don't have time to wait.
What is this?

2
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:26,413
Do you have any idea? What's going on?

3
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:35,127
I know, honey, I'm on my way, okay?

4
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:40,895
Hi. I need to check your bag.

5
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:18,670
Right this way.

6
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:26,440
Come on, let's go. Get out of the way, now.

7
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:30,847
Hold it!

8
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:35,111
<i>Please take the ticket.</i>

9
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:38,584
<i>Please take the ticket.</i>

10
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:41,827
<i>Please take the ticket.</i>

11
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:57,068
Come on! Get in there!

12
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:08,882
<i>Please insert card.</i>

13
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:12,852
<i>Please insert card.</i>

14
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:17,192
<i>Please insert card.</i>

15
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:21,367
<i>Please insert card.</i>

16
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:25,535
I can't follow you guys. You drive too slow.

17
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,434
Bernie. Hey.

18
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:32,242
- Sad, huh?
- Tragic.

19
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:34,473
- Poor Jocelyn.
- It's ridiculous.

20
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:36,242
- Daniel, he was her world.
- Hold up. Cat hair.

21
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:40,150
Oh, that's why I never wear black.
Don't even look in the mirror anymore.

22
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,882
Should've thought of it years ago.

23
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:46,153
We celebrate a very special life

24
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:51,721
as we lay to rest Jocelyn's cherished
companion, Pridey Sahara Morgan.

25
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:13,474
Honey, we have to stay.
She raised him from a puppy.

26
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:15,953
All I know is that if I'm not back
in the office this afternoon,

27
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:17,751
Monday is gonna be hell.

28
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:19,917
She went to every one
of Allegra's birthday parties.

29
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:24,259
Oh, come on. Allegra is our actual child.
Let's get some perspective here.

30
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,264
Do you think if Jocelyn
were married with kids

31
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:29,460
she'd be giving her dog a state funeral?

32
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:31,469
This whole thing is warped.

33
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:34,097
- I find that personally offensive, Dad.
- What?

34
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:36,698
I mean, I may never be married
or be a mother.

35
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:39,006
Yes, some gay women
get some version of that,

36
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:41,308
but we don't all need the same things.

37
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:43,406
Can we at least agree that

38
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,677
human beings need

39
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:48,280
human connection?

40
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:51,585
You know, companionship,
conversation, sex.

41
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:55,560
You get those things from Mom.
Jocelyn gets them from her dogs.

42
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:01,962
Can I take your car?

43
00:05:08,174 --> 00:05:09,698
Dad had to go.

44
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:14,202
We can't let Jocelyn sit home and brood.

45
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,546
Maybe we could all take a class.
Learn Portuguese. Go to Brazil.

46
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:21,678
I don't think I could fit
one more thing in my week, honestly.

47
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:25,815
No, no, you're right. You're right.
We should make an effort.

48
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:28,383
She just lives so far away from everything.

49
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:36,001
Give it back, Trey.

50
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:38,697
Come on. Give it back.

51
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,037
See ya.

52
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:55,285
Thanks. Take care.

53
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:00,082
Hi.

54
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:02,554
- Trey. Yeah.
- Trey.

55
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:04,996
<i>Lovers' Guide to Paris.</i>

56
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:08,557
<i>Food Lovers' Guide.</i>

57
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:11,865
We're gonna go to Paris. My husband and I.

58
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:16,431
It's his first time in Paris. Mine, too.

59
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:18,443
- It's a business trip for him.
- Really?

60
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:20,479
They fly him business class.

61
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:25,415
So we're just gonna do an exchange
so that I can tag along.

62
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:27,282
- That's pretty thrifty.
- Yeah.

63
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:30,379
I've never been to France. I mean...

64
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:34,716
I've been to Québec. But that's...

65
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:38,162
- It's not in... It's in... Okay.
- No.

66
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:41,496
Do you want me to help you
carry these to your car?

67
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:45,397
- No.
- Okay.

68
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:46,802
- Well, have fun.
- Okay.

69
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:48,636
Send me a postcard.

70
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:53,478
- Hi.
- Hey.

71
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:56,811
Honey, I'm sorry I'm late.
I stopped to buy us a present.

72
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:59,044
Oh, yeah. What do you got?

73
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:03,884
- What?
- Oh, baby. I'm sorry.

74
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:05,856
I thought I said something.

75
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,415
- Yo, jeez, these guys are terrible.
- What?

76
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:10,223
Been like this all game. This one guy...

77
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,120
Paris is off.

78
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:15,932
- We're not going to Paris?
- Dale's going.

79
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:21,030
My boss-boss asked me to take the CEO
of Consolidated to the NBA playoffs.

80
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:24,008
I guess the guys at Consolidated
are like basketball freaks.

81
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:26,544
But if it's San Antonio,
it'll be over in four.

82
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:30,173
Unless Tim Duncan gets hit
with an asteroid or something.

83
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:36,247
Anyway, figure I'll be on the road
for like a week, maybe eight days.

84
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:38,654
Maybe 10, just depending on...

85
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:44,595
Oh, what if your mom came and stayed?

86
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:48,023
Ten days with my mother?

87
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:50,630
Prudie.

88
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:55,641
What, did you want me
to say no to my boss?

89
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:04,343
Always doing something wrong, you know?

90
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:10,711
I have no idea what I did.
I genuinely have no idea.

91
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,798
I was just thinking about
something Allegra said

92
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,701
at Jocelyn's the other day.

93
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:27,966
I don't know if it was just
the sadness of the occasion, or...

94
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,405
- Oh, don't make fun, Daniel.
- No, I'm not, I'm not.

95
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:30,965
- That was her dog.
- No.

96
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:33,705
I'm saying it affected me.

97
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:36,339
- Come on.
- Okay, honey. Whatever you say.

98
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:38,440
Anyway, so Allegra and I are talking about

99
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,543
how we all need to have

100
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,152
connection, you know?

101
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,125
Conversation. Sex.

102
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:50,061
Companionship.

103
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:55,033
And Allegra says,
"Well, you get all that from Mommy. "

104
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:57,735
I gotta tell you, it really made me sad.

105
00:08:57,803 --> 00:09:00,101
Oh, baby, she'll find somebody.

106
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:02,640
No, it made me sad for us.

107
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,040
See, 'cause I've been struggling

108
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:10,080
with whether a marriage
can sustain all of that

109
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,046
over 20-plus years,

110
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:19,057
or whether it's just inevitable
that after a certain amount of time...

111
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,149
What are you...

112
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,854
Maybe being with someone else can have

113
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:27,557
a renewing effect, because for me...

114
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:34,871
I've been seeing a woman at work.

115
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:39,543
We've been together six months now.

116
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:41,637
We can't think of this as a failure.

117
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:44,148
We have had a very successful marriage.

118
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:47,879
We've had a long marriage, by any
standard. We've got three wonderful kids.

119
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:49,182
They're grown, they're working, they're...

120
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:52,747
Just open the car door, Daniel,
I need a tissue.

121
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:04,993
The kids, that's... That's all you.
You know, you...

122
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:09,799
You made all the sacrifices with that.
I know.

123
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:12,673
But there's a logic to us
quitting while we're ahead.

124
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:15,737
And I think that they'll be able to see that.

125
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:19,817
I don't understand a single word
of what you're saying, Daniel.

126
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:21,375
Who is this woman?

127
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:26,121
Look, I'm tired of lying to you.

128
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:29,423
I'm tired of making promises to Pam
that I can't keep.

129
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:31,986
She deserves better. And so do you.

130
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:36,559
And I won't give her up.
That's non-negotiable.

131
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:49,206
Syl.

132
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:57,720
I really like Edmund in this movie.
Have you seen it?

133
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,018
I love this movie.

134
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:02,754
<i>Oh, I like it, but it's not Mansfield Park.</i>

135
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,557
It's more of an interpretation.

136
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,495
- Do you know the book?
- Yes.

137
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:09,329
And I happen to teach film.

138
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:11,597
- Do you like this movie?
- No.

139
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,834
Do you know it mixes up Fanny Price
with the author of the book?

140
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:17,842
Makes Sir Bertram
some kind of slave owner.

141
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,434
Well, it means well.

142
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,139
And a little Jane Austen's
better than none at all.

143
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:24,649
No. No. No.
That is how I talk myself into everything.

144
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,985
I'm married to a man

145
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:31,422
who would cancel our trip to Paris
for a basketball game,

146
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:35,221
which is making me a fraud
in front of my students.

147
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:38,263
A French teacher
who's never been to France?

148
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,991
The screenplay is outstanding.

149
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:44,025
Excuse me. I'd like to talk to you.
Come with me.

150
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:45,900
You seem to know a lot about Jane Austen.

151
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:47,029
I do.

152
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:50,098
You know, Prudie,
I've been married six times.

153
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,879
You're always happy at first.
It's how you feel at the end that counts.

154
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:58,349
I've been thinking, I'd like to get
married again, maybe just once more.

155
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:03,080
My favorite was Ben Weinberg.
And this is Ben.

156
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:07,681
He produced Fred Astaire movies.
Don't underestimate older men.

157
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,228
We lived in a house in Beverly Hills
that had a little pond

158
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:12,127
and a bridge and goldfish.

159
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:14,132
That's how I met my friend Jocelyn.

160
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,634
- Carlos.
- My pleasure.

161
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:19,000
Ben was her godfather. Her family's loaded.

162
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,834
Who's Jocelyn again?

163
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:24,401
The one I wanna start the book club for.
Lost her dog?

164
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:27,640
Eat. So, book club.

165
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:30,443
I can get Jocelyn and maybe Sylvia.

166
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:32,347
Jocelyn put Sylvia and Daniel together
in high school.

167
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:33,510
They've been together ever since.

168
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,953
Though Sylvia's gonna want Daniel
in the book club,

169
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:38,683
but I think it should be all women.
Don't you?

170
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,249
I mean, men, they pontificate
and no one can get a word in edgewise.

171
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:43,056
- Well, I think if you...
- And women won't butt in,

172
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:45,859
but men, they keep monologuing.
Yammer, yammer, yammer.

173
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,399
And we keep listening,
protecting their feelings.

174
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:50,560
- But if...
- And men don't do book clubs.

175
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:53,434
Women want to share,
but men, they hoard what they read,

176
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:55,599
if they crack open a book.

177
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:57,574
Does your husband read?

178
00:12:57,643 --> 00:12:59,873
He reads stuff online.

179
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:05,081
You know, it's gonna be
like extracting teeth to get Sylvia,

180
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,779
because she has to read so much already.

181
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:10,378
She works at the state library. But, oh!
Hey, no. Okay.

182
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,151
Now, this is brilliant.

183
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:14,692
We'll only do books we've already read.
Is that inspired?

184
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,955
How do we know what books
all of us have read?

185
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:18,189
Isn't it obvious?

186
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:23,964
<i>Mansfield Park, Pride and Prejudice,
Emma, Northanger Abbey, Persuasion.</i>

187
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:25,196
<i>- I'm leaving some...
- Sense and Sensibility.</i>

188
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:26,431
<i>And Sense and Sensibility.
It's been three years</i>

189
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:29,372
<i>since I've read Sense and Sensibility.
I have to pee.</i>

190
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:30,931
When I get back, hot water and lemon.

191
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,409
And we still have to think
of two more people.

192
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,467
Six novels, six people.

193
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:35,980
We'll each be responsible for one book.

194
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:38,414
All Jane Austen, all the time!

195
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:39,644
It's the perfect antidote.

196
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:41,413
- To what?
- To life.

197
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,047
<i>I get Pride and Prejudice.</i>

198
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:51,727
I called the library
and said you had bronchitis.

199
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:55,062
Anne Marie's moving your indigenous
peoples meeting to next week.

200
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:56,658
I should go in.

201
00:13:56,869 --> 00:14:02,239
Pam Gower did her law degree at Bolt,
passed the bar in 2002.

202
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:03,466
She's an infant.

203
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:08,309
She joined the firm
of Perry, Liebman, Avila in 2006.

204
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,780
Says here she was divorced in 2005.

205
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,511
Bitch. She went right for Daniel.

206
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:13,882
She's 45.

207
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:16,814
She's not even young.

208
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:20,689
- Do you think he has a brain tumor?
- I think he fell in love.

209
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:22,522
Well, I'm rooting for the brain tumor.

210
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:25,223
People our age don't fall in love.
I mean, I've never even been in love.

211
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:28,789
- You've never been in love?
- I've had sexual partners.

212
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:32,269
I mean, I don't know.
I wouldn't mind falling in love,

213
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:34,829
but it just all seems
like fiction to me, anyway.

214
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:38,741
Well, for a fiction,
he just threw 20 years of marriage away

215
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:40,301
on an impulse.

216
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:43,044
Do you think he was thinking,
the whole time,

217
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:44,377
"I can't wait to get out of here?"

218
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:47,112
- Am I really that uninteresting?
- No.

219
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:50,986
- I can't believe I'm alone at this age.
- Mom, you're not alone.

220
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,183
And listen to me.
Alone's not the end of the world.

221
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:56,820
For as many years as you've been married
I've been quite happily unmarried.

222
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,761
It's just so unfair.

223
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:00,890
He can start his life over again.
And at this age.

224
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:04,561
You know, men can do that.
Women... It's over.

225
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:06,070
You're beautiful, Mommy.

226
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:08,504
Yes, and accomplished and interesting.

227
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,474
You're not without your options, Sylvia.

228
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:13,705
Daniel's the one with options.
He can sleep with anyone.

229
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:17,271
Twenty-year-olds.
People will say, "Way to go, Daniel. "

230
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:20,950
If I tried to sleep with someone
that age, it'd be pathetic.

231
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:24,285
Well, yeah, that's 'cause
guys my age are lame.

232
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:27,086
- My body will become a museum.
- No, it won't.

233
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:31,322
We'll get you a membership to my gym.
You might even meet somebody.

234
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:37,996
I don't wanna meet someone.

235
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:41,801
I wanna pull the covers over my head
and read novels.

236
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:44,304
And eat.

237
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:47,635
I'm starving.

238
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,576
<i>Allegra, mija, go get me a dozen eggs.</i>

239
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:55,083
- I'm gonna make a flan.
- Okay.

240
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,286
Can you stay with her this weekend?

241
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:00,985
- Actually, I'm moving back in.
- Really?

242
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:06,260
My lease is almost up and, you know,
I won't let her be here alone.

243
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:09,163
Oh, sweetie, that's... Thank you.
You're amazing.

244
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:12,032
See, that's why people have children.

245
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:16,803
My father left my mom when I was 10.
Sylvia was the first person I told.

246
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,968
That's when I knew
we were really best friends.

247
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:21,035
I'm gonna be at Stockton
at the Breeders' Convention,

248
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:22,171
if you need me, okay?

249
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:44,327
- Are you here for the Buffy conference?
- Oh, no.

250
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,176
Excuse me.

251
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:00,717
My dog has the same exact collar.

252
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,631
- She was invisible.
- What?

253
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,431
It's a game. They're vampires.

254
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:20,563
When you see one of them
with their arms crossed like that,

255
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,731
you should pretend you don't see her.

256
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:24,298
That's why she didn't answer you.
Nothing personal.

257
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:25,604
Thanks.

258
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:30,343
- My name's Grigg.
- Greg?

259
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,281
Grigg, G-R-I-G-G.

260
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,352
Oh. I'm meeting some people, Grigg.

261
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:41,518
Okay.

262
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,144
Can I have a whiskey straight up?

263
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:34,040
Excuse me. Could I apologize? I'm Jocelyn.

264
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,013
Your friend isn't coming?

265
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:38,413
I'm meeting him a little later.

266
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:43,451
So how do you know so much
about the "faux vampire" scene?

267
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:46,889
That's funny. Well, it's...

268
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,484
I'm here for a sci-fi conference.

269
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:54,863
So the Buffy contingent is a kind of,
you know, offshoot of that.

270
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:57,094
Yeah. You read much science fiction?

271
00:18:57,169 --> 00:19:00,502
<i>I'm more of a Jane Austen,
Jane Eyre kind of girl.</i>

272
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:02,631
Oh, right, yeah. No, I never really...

273
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:05,404
Read those books? Yeah. Yeah.

274
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:09,308
So, where do you live?

275
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:13,784
I just relocated to the Sacramento area.
I do tech support at U.

276
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:18,114
You know who you might like?
Ursula Le Guin.

277
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,988
<i>Left Hand of Darkness. Lathe of Heaven.</i>

278
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:24,585
She's science fiction
but she's just a terrific writer.

279
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,062
- Have to check her out.
- Yeah.

280
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:30,067
My sisters love those books.
I really think you might like them.

281
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:36,230
And I'm willing to be directed as well.

282
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:38,503
Seriously, you know,
if you tell me who I should be reading,

283
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:40,841
I promise to read it.

284
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:43,108
I'll give you my email.

285
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:46,548
That's the old one.
I'll write those books, too.

286
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:49,985
You know what I'm actually
wondering before I go?

287
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:52,489
How do you feel about older women?

288
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:56,693
Great. Yeah.

289
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:00,990
I have three older sisters, so...

290
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:04,367
You know, I like all women.

291
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:06,961
Good. That's great.

292
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:10,804
- Well, thanks. I'll be in touch.
- Oh, okay.

293
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:11,865
Great.

294
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:13,605
- Yeah, bye.
- Bye.

295
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:19,514
Oh, good, Prudie, you're here.

296
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:21,917
Save these tables, okay?
Oh, Jocelyn, Prudie.

297
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:23,511
- Hi, how are you?
- Hello. Good.

298
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:26,752
- So what do you want, Prudie?
- A soy cappuccino.

299
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:31,095
I have to be allowed
to miss one meeting out of the six.

300
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:32,494
I can only do this if there's no pressure.

301
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:35,124
- Hey. Mom's looking for parking.
- Hi.

302
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,100
That's Prudie. Say hi.

303
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:41,429
We're still only five. Too bad about Daniel.

304
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:45,966
He could've filled in, although clearly
he's never read Jane Austen.

305
00:20:46,044 --> 00:20:49,036
For Prudie's sake, the last
thing we need is an Austen virgin.

306
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:50,877
We need real discussion.

307
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:54,578
I sort of invited someone.
Said he might come, maybe.

308
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:56,745
- He?
- No one I'm interested in.

309
00:20:57,556 --> 00:21:00,923
He's young, compliant,
said he might enjoy being in a book club.

310
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:02,984
I'm sure Daniel's read Jane Austen.

311
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:04,995
No man who reads Austen
would ever dump his wife

312
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:07,293
because it's better for the other woman.

313
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:08,731
Chai latte with a shot.

314
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,530
I'm so sorry. I'm really behind.

315
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:14,003
I got slammed with orders on my website.

316
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:17,906
I've actually... I've started adding
these little dangles at the top here.

317
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:21,036
- What do you think?
- I'm no judge.

318
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,603
I mean, my idea of jewelry

319
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:26,048
is Coco Chanel's Byzantine oeuvre
from the 1920s.

320
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:29,551
Oh! Definitely. Yeah, I get that.

321
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:34,548
Being the only child of a woman
who gave birth in a commune

322
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:39,586
after changing her name to Sky Girl,
I've come to loathe hippie handicrafts.

323
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:43,968
There she is.

324
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:48,397
Actually, I'm not so sure
I wanna do this book club.

325
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:53,205
So, quick, while Sylvia's still in line,
how she's doing without Daniel?

326
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:55,678
She's still stuck in the wounded stage.

327
00:21:55,747 --> 00:21:59,410
- When she's ready for anger, I am so there.
- Me, too.

328
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:00,576
My dad left my mom.

329
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:03,553
Prudie is no stranger
to marital disappointment.

330
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:05,452
Actually, we're fine now.

331
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:07,958
You're married? But no ring, huh?

332
00:22:08,927 --> 00:22:11,054
Yeah, it's this hand, and... I teach French.

333
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:13,597
You teach French, so you wear your
wedding ring on the right hand?

334
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:16,429
- It's a European custom.
- Are you European?

335
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:19,937
So Prudie, you haven't said which book
you wanna be responsible for.

336
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,563
<i>Maybe Persuasion.</i>

337
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,905
'Cause I'm increasingly drawn
to its elegiac tone.

338
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,945
- Don't think I'm doing the book club.
- You're doing it.

339
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:30,641
You lead one discussion. Pick a book.

340
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:35,249
<i>Well, I just saw Sense and Sensibility,</i>

341
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,949
and I think,
since I'm back living with my mom,

342
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:42,460
I really get that whole two-women,

343
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:46,088
tight-relationship, living-together-
but-really-opposites thing.

344
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,029
Is it weird living back at home again?

345
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:51,797
I think what Austen is actually
writing about is two sisters,

346
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:55,237
moving separately toward what
they each believe to be a perfect love.

347
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:59,175
Okay, but the point is
Marianne and Elinor's relationship...

348
00:22:59,244 --> 00:23:01,735
Maybe if you'd read the book
instead of watching the movie...

349
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:04,611
<i>- I thought I might do Emma.
- Which leaves what for Sylvia?</i>

350
00:23:04,683 --> 00:23:06,651
<i>Northanger Abbey and Mansfield Park.</i>

351
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,909
Which one's gonna make her feel better?

352
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:12,081
Because we're only doing the book club
to get her mind off Daniel.

353
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:14,421
I thought the reason for the book club
was for my not going to Paris.

354
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:16,085
<i>- Exactly.
- Northanger Abbey.</i>

355
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:17,753
<i>No, don't make her do Northanger.</i>

356
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:20,229
I mean, first you're going off
to all these dances,

357
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:24,564
<i>and then suddenly it's sort of like
Nightmare on Northanger Abbey Street.</i>

358
00:23:24,636 --> 00:23:27,230
I'm afraid this isn't the book club
that I had in mind.

359
00:23:27,305 --> 00:23:30,672
I mean, I find when someone in the group
feels superior to the author,

360
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,437
it just... It sets the wrong tone.

361
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:33,671
Okay, I'm happy to leave.

362
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:37,181
- No, Allegra. No. Allegra. No.
- Allegra, you can't. You can't.

363
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,740
After this day, I am so happy
to be talking about Jane Austen.

364
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:41,513
- Hi.
- Hi. Did we choose the books yet?

365
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,781
Sylvia, Prudie.

366
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:45,846
Oh, I'm sorry. Sylvia Avila.

367
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:48,859
<i>- So, how do you feel about Mansfield Park?
- My favorite.</i>

368
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:51,452
- I love Fanny Price.
- Stop, Mom, why?

369
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:52,758
She's such a goodie-goodie.

370
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:55,095
<i>Six books, five people.
We skip Northanger Abbey.</i>

371
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:57,294
- Definitely.
- And miss out on Mr. Tilney?

372
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:59,769
- No, you're right.
- He's such a flirt.

373
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:01,430
We don't have to do all six books, do we?

374
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:04,373
<i>Doing all six novels
is the raison d'être of the book club</i>

375
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,809
and it is the only reason I'm here.

376
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:09,608
- Okay.
- Do you wanna invite your husband?

377
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:24,584
My husband has never read Austen
and he never will.

378
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:25,652
Okay, how should we do this?

379
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:27,630
Just meet once a month
at each of our houses, potluck...

380
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:29,132
Or, you know, pick some central location.

381
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:30,828
No, I don't think a coffee shop's conducive.

382
00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:32,927
<i>I'll host the first one, we'll
start with Emma, at my place.</i>

383
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:34,437
But let's not get into this
competitive cooking thing.

384
00:24:34,506 --> 00:24:35,734
Bakeoffs!

385
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,638
- No, we'll do finger foods.
- We're gonna do takeout.

386
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:40,542
And we have to create
the Jane Austen mood.

387
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:43,047
- Oh, my God.
- Hey.

388
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:44,342
- He came.
- Yeah.

389
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:47,749
Sorry, I sat in the wrong Starbucks
for half an hour.

390
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:55,390
Golly, there are a lot of these places, huh?

391
00:24:55,460 --> 00:25:00,022
But they've got interesting coffee
from all over the world, so...

392
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:05,730
- This is Grigg, everyone.
- I'm Bernadette.

393
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:07,968
- Prudie.
- Prudie, and Allegra.

394
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:09,700
- Sylvia.
- Grigg Harris.

395
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:13,035
Hi.

396
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,541
Well, I'm excited.

397
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:20,049
Never read anything by Jane Austen before.

398
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:23,845
What is it?

399
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:26,857
Well, I went to the bookstore
to buy a copy of each one of the novels,

400
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:27,914
and I saw this.

401
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:29,961
And I thought,
"Well, maybe they're all sequels. "

402
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:33,122
So, I figured it might be a good idea
to keep them all together in one book,

403
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:35,826
in case I needed to refer back.

404
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:37,960
Is this the order that we read them in?

405
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:41,005
Do you wanna grab a coffee, Grigg?

406
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:44,564
No, no. No, I'm fine.
I had plenty at the other place.

407
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:48,807
And... I bought this and they filled it up
for me, so I'm a little...

408
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:51,271
Yeah.

409
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:55,080
Oh, you said in your email
there was someone you wanted me to meet?

410
00:25:55,153 --> 00:25:59,180
Yeah. Yeah, all of us, actually.

411
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:02,089
I thought we might benefit from the
perspective of a male in the group.

412
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,560
- A little testosterone.
- Right.

413
00:26:04,629 --> 00:26:08,497
- Okay. So, none of you ladies are married?
- Prudie.

414
00:26:15,106 --> 00:26:18,598
Right, so we just... What?
We just read them chronologically, and...

415
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:21,612
<i>- We're doing Emma first.
- Emma?</i>

416
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,580
Oh. Starting in the middle, huh?

417
00:26:23,648 --> 00:26:26,446
- They're not sequels.
- They're not?

418
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:29,316
Well, great. We just start anywhere.

419
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:35,182
- What were you smoking?
- He's cute.

420
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,956
I thought he'd be a distraction for Sylvia.

421
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:40,793
She needs an adventure. If he
becomes a problem I'll get rid of him.

422
00:26:40,865 --> 00:26:44,028
- What happened, you pull a DUl?
- No, no, I pretty much bike everywhere.

423
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:45,535
Where do you live?

424
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:49,701
About 20 miles north. Vista Mar.

425
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:53,107
- You live in what, that development?
- Yeah. Yeah.

426
00:26:53,178 --> 00:26:56,670
I had this software company
and my accountant says to me,

427
00:26:56,748 --> 00:26:57,976
"You gotta buy a house. "

428
00:26:58,049 --> 00:27:00,108
So, we were right by that exit.

429
00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:03,621
And I said, "Pull over. "

430
00:27:03,688 --> 00:27:06,156
Got out, went in, pointed, bought a house.

431
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:08,385
- Like that.
- I should sell it, I guess.

432
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,327
Or at least buy some furniture.

433
00:27:11,396 --> 00:27:13,626
Well, I guess I'll have to,
if you guys are coming over, right?

434
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,061
Allegra.

435
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:18,566
- Bye.
- Yeah. Sayonara.

436
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:23,039
You know, I never picked a book.

437
00:27:23,108 --> 00:27:26,077
Could I do that abbey one?

438
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:28,578
<i>- Perfect. Yeah, it's yours.
- Oh, Northanger Abbey.</i>

439
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,638
Great. All right.

440
00:27:30,715 --> 00:27:33,275
<i>- Emma. Starting in the middle.
- Yeah.</i>

441
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:42,292
Well, you gotta hand it to him
for taking the dud book.

442
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,725
It's the shortest, that's why.

443
00:27:43,795 --> 00:27:46,491
- He's eager to please.
- Prudie, see you next time.

444
00:27:46,564 --> 00:27:48,896
He is eager to please. He likes women.

445
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:51,936
- A welcome quality in a man.
- Yes. Yes.

446
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:56,667
- Do you think Sylvia responded to him?
- We let him in. It's done.

447
00:27:56,741 --> 00:27:58,936
- Bye.
- Bye. Bye.

448
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:18,459
You're up.

449
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:31,171
Go big!

450
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:21,053
You okay?

451
00:29:24,028 --> 00:29:26,588
Hey. Hey, you. Listen.

452
00:29:26,664 --> 00:29:29,360
Can you make sure
they don't call my mother? Please.

453
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:32,232
Just make sure they don't call my mother.

454
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:36,269
Mrs. Avila? This is Corinne.

455
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:40,334
- I'm a friend of Allegra's.
- Allegra's.

456
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:43,107
And she's asked me to call you.

457
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:45,672
We're up here in Vacaville at a...

458
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:47,217
- Jewelry show.
... jewelry show.

459
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:52,120
I was showing her how to use my scooter
and she took a little spill.

460
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:54,590
It's minor. She banged up her wrist.

461
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:58,390
She doesn't need you to come. It's
nothing. We're at the doctor's.

462
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,931
He says she could be a bit sore.

463
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:06,264
Allegra didn't want you to worry
if she's not home tonight.

464
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:09,902
I'll remind her. Book club Monday night.

465
00:31:31,422 --> 00:31:32,753
I'm sorry.

466
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:37,695
We don't shop on this side of town, ever.

467
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:42,627
Sorry.

468
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:48,095
You can have this Whole Foods.
We won't ever use it again. Okay?

469
00:31:58,783 --> 00:32:03,220
So I was getting the wine for book club
and I bumped into Daniel.

470
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:04,312
He was with her.

471
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:05,879
<i>- Oh, sweetie.
- Yeah.</i>

472
00:32:05,957 --> 00:32:08,482
They were going home to make dinner.

473
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:11,587
He was wearing a jacket with a zipper.

474
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:14,223
<i>- No.
- That's so not Daniel.</i>

475
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:20,193
I just... I walk around this house,
and it's not my home anymore.

476
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:23,399
I feel like Fanny Price
banished from Mansfield Park.

477
00:32:23,474 --> 00:32:27,740
- That woman is living my life.
- Honey, she can't live your life.

478
00:32:27,812 --> 00:32:29,643
<i>Are you all right?</i>

479
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:34,174
I know you like being alone,
but don't you ever get lonely?

480
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:42,290
So what'd you think about Grigg?

481
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,357
The book club guy.

482
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:47,462
If you like him, I like him.

483
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:51,195
- How about those dreamy eyes?
- I didn't really notice.

484
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:52,463
Well, notice.

485
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:55,529
Can you come early tomorrow
since you're bringing the wine?

486
00:32:55,606 --> 00:32:59,064
That's my girls. That's my girls.
That's my girls.

487
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:01,645
It's a smallish world, pedigreed Ridgebacks.

488
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:05,308
- "Pedigreed" is...
- Well, it's breeding.

489
00:33:05,383 --> 00:33:07,943
Certain bloodlines
are naturally more valuable.

490
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:12,285
Mine are out of Queenie of the Serengeti.
Gorgeous hound. Gone now.

491
00:33:13,257 --> 00:33:16,886
I bred her to my first
really important sire, Pridey.

492
00:33:16,961 --> 00:33:21,159
Sire's the boy dog. Great disposition.
Passed away last month.

493
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:23,223
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

494
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:26,737
Miss him. But Queenie was the real star.

495
00:33:26,804 --> 00:33:31,002
Ridgebacks are matriarchal.
That's one of their attractive features.

496
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:33,737
Hey, hey, hey! Sahara, off!

497
00:33:33,811 --> 00:33:35,802
Sorry. Sorry about that.

498
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:40,442
Sahara I had to have spayed.
Thyroid issues.

499
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:45,148
I still show her, though.
She's very competitive in her category.

500
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:48,192
- Yeah?
- Sexually altered bitch.

501
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:54,163
Well, I got you those books.

502
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:57,224
You know the ones I suggested?
Ursula Le Guin.

503
00:33:57,335 --> 00:34:00,862
Oh, yeah. Thanks, that was thoughtful.

504
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:05,041
You don't have to bring a hostess gift
to these meetings, FYI.

505
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:06,974
It's just a book club.

506
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,944
Where's the heat
between Emma and Mr. Knightley?

507
00:34:12,016 --> 00:34:13,745
There's no animal passion.

508
00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:16,286
Look at Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax.

509
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:19,016
You can tell they're really in love
because they behave so badly.

510
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:20,079
And that's good?

511
00:34:20,158 --> 00:34:25,425
Emma and Mr. Knightley,
you just never feel the sex.

512
00:34:26,097 --> 00:34:29,089
Still, I think Mr. Knightley's very yummy.
Don't you?

513
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:32,068
He may be my favorite of all the Austen men.

514
00:34:32,136 --> 00:34:34,468
<i>Sans passion I'amour n'est rien.</i>

515
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:37,903
- That's not Jane's theme, is it?
- Jane?

516
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:39,442
That's cozy.

517
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:44,976
What we're meant to see
is not the lack of passion

518
00:34:45,049 --> 00:34:48,280
so much as the control of it,
and the not giving in.

519
00:34:48,352 --> 00:34:50,183
<i>Après moi, le deluge.</i>

520
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:54,491
But Prudie's right, it is in all the novels.

521
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,719
<i>Sense and Sensibility, obviously.</i>

522
00:34:56,794 --> 00:34:59,558
<i>Oh, and then there's Maria's infidelity
in Mansfield Park.</i>

523
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,860
<i>I forgot there's infidelity
in Mansfield Park.</i>

524
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,457
Austen's all about keeping it zipped.

525
00:35:03,534 --> 00:35:08,164
Yeah, but isn't physical attraction
one of the ungovernable forces?

526
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:11,106
You know, like gravity.
That's what we like about it.

527
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:16,238
You know, downhill, release the brakes,
loosen your grip, and...

528
00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:18,544
Yeah. Love makes people crazy.

529
00:35:18,649 --> 00:35:21,777
- It does not excuse bad behavior.
- I agree.

530
00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:25,812
And Mr. Knightley is violently in love.
"Violently!" His word.

531
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:27,949
And yet, he's never anything
but a gentleman.

532
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:30,721
- Yeah, a gentleman who scolds people.
- Not everyone.

533
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:33,423
You know, just Emma,
just the woman that he loves.

534
00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:35,728
<i>C'est vrai. C'est typique.</i>

535
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,098
A man can do whatever he likes
to the woman he loves.

536
00:35:38,169 --> 00:35:40,034
I don't think that's what Austen's saying.

537
00:35:40,104 --> 00:35:43,267
Actually, Emma stops being crazy
when she falls for Mr. Knightley.

538
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:46,071
It's the event of the book.
Love is an act of sanity.

539
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:49,602
<i>One thing that I noticed about Emma
is the sense of menace.</i>

540
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,548
The gypsies,
Jane Fairfax's boating accident,

541
00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:54,710
Mr. Woodhouse's worries.

542
00:35:54,785 --> 00:35:58,448
Austen's entire thesis is that
none of these things are real, Grigg.

543
00:35:58,523 --> 00:36:02,983
I mean, Emma, she acts
on the basis of her fantasies.

544
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,620
Yes, Grigg, I'm afraid
you've just entirely missed the point.

545
00:36:05,696 --> 00:36:07,425
<i>You know, I've read that the Emma plot,</i>

546
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:11,127
the humbling of the pretty, know-it-all
girl is the most popular plot of all time.

547
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:13,329
Yes, universally satisfying.

548
00:36:15,072 --> 00:36:17,233
Okay. Well, what bothered me

549
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:20,505
was how Emma kept forcing
her friend Harriet on Mr. Elton.

550
00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:22,239
And then she finds out
who Harriet's father is,

551
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:24,372
and suddenly, "Ew!"
She's lucky to get the farmer.

552
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:27,815
I think Jane was being ironic there.
I think some readers might miss that.

553
00:36:27,885 --> 00:36:29,716
- Emma's a snob.
- Please.

554
00:36:29,787 --> 00:36:33,223
People are instinctively drawn to partners
who are their near equal in looks.

555
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:36,124
The pretty marry the pretty,
the ugly the ugly.

556
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:38,560
To the detriment of the breed,
in my opinion.

557
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:41,655
God, you're such an Emma. Isn't she?

558
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:44,792
You'd love to pair up the whole world,
from dogs to people.

559
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:47,064
Put me together with Daniel.

560
00:36:50,508 --> 00:36:52,806
And you had beautiful children.

561
00:36:55,780 --> 00:37:00,342
Oh, no, don't get up, Jocelyn.
I'll get the tea. Sorry.

562
00:37:03,454 --> 00:37:04,682
Mom.

563
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:29,072
I hope we didn't scare Grigg away.

564
00:37:29,146 --> 00:37:33,344
- Yeah, he sure got out of here fast.
- Yeah, we'll toughen him up.

565
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:34,884
Was the book club a bad idea?

566
00:37:34,952 --> 00:37:38,820
Austen has a way of making you forget
that most marriages end in divorce.

567
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:41,050
Well, she's all about the weddings, Jane.

568
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:42,990
Yeah, "Jane. " Did you catch that?

569
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:46,359
Oh, Prudie?
"Jane and I, we know our themes. "

570
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,762
And why did she have to speak in French?

571
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:52,826
And if so, couldn't she do it in France,
where it's less noticeable?

572
00:37:52,903 --> 00:37:56,634
I feel for Prudie.
She's married to a complete Neanderthal.

573
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:02,473
Okay, I will call you when I
land in Dallas. You know what?

574
00:38:02,546 --> 00:38:05,037
Let me call you when I check in the hotel
if there's time before the game,

575
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,209
- 'cause we're gonna wanna get there early.
- Whatever, okay.

576
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,048
Have fun with your mom.

577
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,815
- Hey, Sky. Hi.
- Hi.

578
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:13,220
Mom, you were supposed
to sit with the car.

579
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:14,622
I'm gonna get a ticket!

580
00:38:14,692 --> 00:38:16,557
- Yo!
- Get some ass!

581
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:19,887
So... Hey, what're we doing today?

582
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:22,194
Well, I'm teaching. It's a school day, okay?

583
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:23,290
So I'm gonna drop you at the house.

584
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:25,733
Or you can take the car
and you can go see a movie or something.

585
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:28,169
- No, no, I'll hang with you.
- No, no, you can't.

586
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:30,070
They don't allow that.

587
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:32,871
Mom, could you... Oh, my God, please.

588
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:35,910
Okay, I can't.

589
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:39,348
Mom, I'm late. Please. Come on.

590
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:41,317
Oh, ditch them. Blow them off.

591
00:38:41,385 --> 00:38:45,617
Tell them your mother doesn't wanna
hang around while you go to work.

592
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:52,393
What's the story with the clothes?
You dress like a flight attendant.

593
00:38:52,463 --> 00:38:56,126
No, I dress like a teacher.
Or it gets confusing.

594
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,169
Mom, mind your stupid... For everyone.

595
00:38:59,236 --> 00:39:01,431
Why would anyone
wanna teach high school?

596
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:02,972
I hated my teachers.

597
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,270
Well, I'm just gonna settle you at the house.

598
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:09,109
No, I'll drop you at school
and then I'll take the car.

599
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,341
- Should you be driving?
- Huh?

600
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:17,280
Okay, you know what?
Just don't forget to come get me at 3:00.

601
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,118
Okay? Don't forget.

602
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:33,292
<i>I'm in Brigadoon.
Would you mind running lines with me?</i>

603
00:39:34,805 --> 00:39:35,931
"Of course I'm all right. "

604
00:39:36,006 --> 00:39:38,201
"I'd have died
if anything had happened to you.

605
00:39:38,275 --> 00:39:40,266
"I love you so. "

606
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:42,312
"But how can you be sure in just one day?"

607
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,642
"I dinna know, 'tis just

608
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:47,548
"when a lass falls in and out of love,
she knows it right away. "

609
00:39:48,986 --> 00:39:51,750
- What?
- It's a good accent.

610
00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:53,915
Well, languages are my speciality.
I just thought that...

611
00:39:53,991 --> 00:39:55,754
French teacher.

612
00:39:58,963 --> 00:40:00,828
It's your line.

613
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:02,991
"Do you think you're in love with me?"

614
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:04,864
"Think? What good does thinking do?

615
00:40:04,935 --> 00:40:06,835
"But what I feel is something else. "

616
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:09,134
"What do ye feel then, Tommy?"

617
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:12,470
And then we kiss.

618
00:40:14,645 --> 00:40:16,875
Who plays opposite you?

619
00:40:18,282 --> 00:40:19,749
Karen Bhave.

620
00:40:21,652 --> 00:40:26,316
I think she only tried out because
she thought we'd hook up during the play.

621
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:34,924
I saw you watching me in the library.

622
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:38,059
- I wasn't watching.
- You were watching.

623
00:40:38,135 --> 00:40:39,796
No, I was reading.

624
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:43,267
- You were watching.
- I was reading this...

625
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:46,601
- I was reading this book...
- Oh, yeah?

626
00:40:46,677 --> 00:40:49,441
...about some people
in this house called Mansfield Park.

627
00:40:49,513 --> 00:40:50,605
- Austen.
- Yeah.

628
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:54,344
<i>We're doing Mansfield Park
for senior seminar, so...</i>

629
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:58,821
I actually bought the book already.
I'm trying to make myself wait, you know?

630
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:04,387
Delay gratification. That sort of thing.

631
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:10,699
- So what happens?
- Right, well...

632
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:13,362
Well, they decide to put on a play
in the house.

633
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:17,203
And rehearsing it, it sort of unleashes them.

634
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:20,072
Two of them actually fall in love, and one...

635
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:23,477
One of them, Maria
Bertram, is set... Stop it.

636
00:41:23,547 --> 00:41:26,038
- Is set to marry someone else.
- Or maybe not.

637
00:41:26,116 --> 00:41:28,107
Well, I think... I think...

638
00:41:28,185 --> 00:41:32,178
I think what Austen is trying to say
is that play-acting is dangerous.

639
00:41:32,256 --> 00:41:36,556
All of that intimacy backstage,
the waiting and the whispering,

640
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:42,224
and onstage you're gazing at each other,
and "I love you. "

641
00:41:42,299 --> 00:41:43,630
I mean...

642
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:46,730
Well, you can see how it happens.

643
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:50,535
Yeah, I can see it happening,
just not with Karen Bhave.

644
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:54,343
So, do you wanna go over it again?

645
00:42:22,473 --> 00:42:23,667
Hello?

646
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:32,983
- Yeah.
- Hey, Grigg, it's Jocelyn.

647
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,608
<i>- Hi. Hey.
- Hi.</i>

648
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:38,716
<i>- So how's Mansfield Park coming?
- Just great.</i>

649
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:40,154
Am I disturbing you?

650
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:44,456
I'm just writing an email to my sisters
about you, as a matter of fact.

651
00:42:44,528 --> 00:42:46,052
<i>And Ursula Le Guin.</i>

652
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:49,031
<i>- Did you ever read Left Hand of Darkness?
- Not yet.</i>

653
00:42:49,133 --> 00:42:50,623
<i>Hey, listen, Bernadette and I
were just saying</i>

654
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:53,761
we hope Allegra didn't
scare you off the book club.

655
00:42:53,837 --> 00:42:56,169
<i>- Which one is Allegra?
- Sylvia's daughter.</i>

656
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,606
Really pretty, really passionate,
wonderful girl.

657
00:42:58,676 --> 00:43:00,803
Ask him if he can make time today.

658
00:43:00,878 --> 00:43:02,675
You might take Sylvia to lunch today.

659
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:05,943
Tell him that Sylvia and Daniel are in
court this morning over their separation.

660
00:43:06,016 --> 00:43:07,677
She could use the ego boost.

661
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:10,151
<i>You have Sylvia's number, right?</i>

662
00:43:12,523 --> 00:43:14,957
Would you wanna come, too?

663
00:43:15,025 --> 00:43:17,220
Listen, I know
there's a difference in your ages,

664
00:43:17,294 --> 00:43:19,888
but I really think
the two of you will hit it off.

665
00:43:19,964 --> 00:43:22,831
Sahara. I gotta go, okay?

666
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:33,042
<i>This woman I like definitely
seems interested, but it's weird.</i>

667
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:37,877
<i>She's sort of pushing me to date this
girl, Allegra, who's way younger than me.</i>

668
00:43:41,919 --> 00:43:45,184
<i>She said I should
take this girl's mother to lunch.</i>

669
00:43:51,161 --> 00:43:53,686
Bank assets will be divided equally.

670
00:43:54,565 --> 00:43:57,090
Each individual will keep his or her own car,

671
00:43:57,167 --> 00:44:01,729
and each will be wholly responsible
for the attendant payments and insurance.

672
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:05,605
The house owned by Daniel and Sylvia
will be jointly held,

673
00:44:05,676 --> 00:44:10,704
with both parties paying an equal share of
property taxes, upkeep and repairs.

674
00:44:10,781 --> 00:44:13,909
Sylvia may live in the
house. Daniel will not.

675
00:44:30,801 --> 00:44:33,793
As soon as Daniel hit
50, his wheels fell off.

676
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:35,395
<i>Here's what I get from Mansfield Park.</i>

677
00:44:35,472 --> 00:44:38,635
That a marriage is only as strong
as its weakest partner.

678
00:44:38,709 --> 00:44:41,769
Daniel has always wanted
to find his center by wobbling.

679
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:43,403
This is a pretty big wobble.

680
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,107
<i>Mansfield Park is full of wobblers.</i>

681
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:49,642
Lady Bertram lying around, letting
a houseful of adolescents run riot.

682
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,347
Fanny Price is the rock of that family.

683
00:44:51,422 --> 00:44:54,152
Fanny's cousin Maria, married six months,
dumps her husband...

684
00:44:54,224 --> 00:44:56,818
And don't forget Fanny's father,
the unemployed alcoholic.

685
00:44:56,894 --> 00:44:59,260
Marry the weak link and you're screwed.
That's what she's saying.

686
00:44:59,329 --> 00:45:02,423
No wonder why Austen never married.
It's terrifying.

687
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:06,302
- I think I finally hate him.
- Good.

688
00:45:08,405 --> 00:45:12,603
I'm home. I'm going out again.
I have book club.

689
00:45:28,325 --> 00:45:31,192
You just missed this guy

690
00:45:31,261 --> 00:45:37,757
who got buried up to his neck in
a tank filled with cockroaches.

691
00:45:37,835 --> 00:45:39,700
And they were real.

692
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:44,238
You'd think it'd be illegal
to show stuff like that.

693
00:45:44,308 --> 00:45:46,071
Here, grab a spoon.

694
00:45:48,979 --> 00:45:50,708
You have to leave.

695
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:57,314
You put your things in your suitcase
'cause I'm booking your flight.

696
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,231
- Want me to...
- Yeah.

697
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:15,561
- How did you break it?
- I fell.

698
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:16,901
Which was kind of lucky, actually.

699
00:46:16,974 --> 00:46:21,138
'Cause I met this girl, Corinne,
who I've been seeing. She's a writer.

700
00:46:21,211 --> 00:46:22,200
Which, um,

701
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:25,172
isn't so great, really,

702
00:46:25,249 --> 00:46:27,774
'cause if she had to choose
between me and writing,

703
00:46:27,851 --> 00:46:30,581
she'd probably choose writing.

704
00:46:30,654 --> 00:46:33,680
But she doesn't ever have to choose.
So you never have to know.

705
00:46:33,757 --> 00:46:37,158
So you're a lesbian. Full-time?

706
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:41,860
You mean, do I ever slip
and accidentally sleep with a man?

707
00:46:41,932 --> 00:46:45,732
No, no, my sister Cat,
she goes out with guys and girls.

708
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:47,100
She lives in Idaho.

709
00:46:47,171 --> 00:46:49,662
Your sister isn't Cat Harris.

710
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:51,708
- You know her?
- Bernadette knows everyone.

711
00:46:51,775 --> 00:46:56,439
I met her through my doctor friend
in Laguna Niguel, Bianca Sillman.

712
00:46:56,513 --> 00:46:58,413
You know my sister, Bianca?

713
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:00,609
I forgot that Bianca and Cat are sisters.

714
00:47:00,684 --> 00:47:03,551
Those are your sisters!

715
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:05,986
Our world is an English village.

716
00:47:08,458 --> 00:47:11,689
My topic is the long-suffering daughter.

717
00:47:11,762 --> 00:47:14,322
One can't help but see the parallels

718
00:47:14,398 --> 00:47:17,424
<i>between the long-suffering
Fanny Price in Mansfield Park</i>

719
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:19,867
<i>and the long-suffering Anne Eliot
in Persuasion.</i>

720
00:47:19,937 --> 00:47:21,404
I hate Fanny Price.

721
00:47:21,471 --> 00:47:25,066
Excuse me, we're not electing
the homecoming queen, okay?

722
00:47:25,142 --> 00:47:27,804
I mean, yes, if this were high school, yes,

723
00:47:27,878 --> 00:47:30,574
we all know Elizabeth Bennet
would be most popular

724
00:47:30,647 --> 00:47:32,239
and that Fanny would be least.

725
00:47:32,316 --> 00:47:35,376
<i>- Who's Elizabeth Bennet?
- Of Pride and Prejudice.</i>

726
00:47:36,787 --> 00:47:39,153
Don't give away too much,
'cause I haven't read that one yet.

727
00:47:39,223 --> 00:47:41,987
<i>- You don't know Pride and Prejudice?
- No.</i>

728
00:47:42,059 --> 00:47:44,960
I think I read somewhere that Fanny Price
was Austen's favorite.

729
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:47,292
- Fanny's boring.
- She's faithful.

730
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:50,162
<i>She's Horton Hatches the Egg.</i>

731
00:47:50,234 --> 00:47:52,828
She sits on that nest
and she never, ever wavers.

732
00:47:52,903 --> 00:47:55,167
Well, she'd probably be easier to like

733
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:57,400
if she would just
allow some weakness in others.

734
00:47:57,474 --> 00:47:59,499
- She doesn't allow it in herself.
- True.

735
00:47:59,576 --> 00:48:02,841
I didn't see what was so bad
about Henry Crawford.

736
00:48:02,913 --> 00:48:05,677
Yes. Thank you, Grigg.
Why does it have to be Edmund?

737
00:48:05,749 --> 00:48:09,014
Well, Austen, she's always suspicious
of people who are too charming.

738
00:48:09,086 --> 00:48:11,782
<i>Just once I'd like to pick up Mansfield Park</i>

739
00:48:11,855 --> 00:48:15,154
and see Fanny end up in the sack
with Henry Crawford.

740
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:16,214
Yes! Yes!

741
00:48:16,326 --> 00:48:18,055
You can't read these novels
without wondering

742
00:48:18,128 --> 00:48:19,993
if she doesn't have a little thing
for the naughty boys.

743
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:21,360
Well, who doesn't?

744
00:48:21,431 --> 00:48:23,399
Except for Fanny Price.

745
00:48:23,467 --> 00:48:27,631
Okay, look. I love Fanny. She works hard.

746
00:48:27,704 --> 00:48:30,298
- She puts her family's needs above her own.
- Mom, it's okay.

747
00:48:30,374 --> 00:48:33,241
And she never, ever
stops loving Edmund, ever.

748
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:35,778
Even when he's stupid enough
to do something like

749
00:48:35,846 --> 00:48:38,041
take up with Mary Crawford.

750
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:46,889
Oh, dear.

751
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:50,458
<i>I thought Mansfield Park would be safe,
didn't you?</i>

752
00:48:50,527 --> 00:48:52,757
I don't think we're gonna get through
all six books.

753
00:48:52,829 --> 00:48:56,390
Reading Jane Austen is a freaking minefield.

754
00:48:57,234 --> 00:49:00,101
You're awfully quiet, Grigg. Any thoughts?

755
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:02,363
Yeah.

756
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:17,345
Yeah. Yes!

757
00:49:17,421 --> 00:49:20,413
The relationship
between Edmund and Fanny.

758
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:22,924
They seemed like brother and sister.

759
00:49:22,993 --> 00:49:26,622
<i>But then in the end,
it's like The Empire Strikes Back,</i>

760
00:49:26,697 --> 00:49:32,397
<i>but it's in reverse. You know?
'Cause in Jedi, Luke Skywalker,</i>

761
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:35,632
he gets over Princess Leia
when she turns out to be his sister.

762
00:49:35,706 --> 00:49:40,905
Edmund gets over Miss Crawford and gets it
on with Fanny, who's his first cousin, so...

763
00:49:48,752 --> 00:49:50,845
Did that bother anybody else?

764
00:49:50,921 --> 00:49:53,981
- Weren't you gonna call Sylvia for lunch?
- Oh, yeah.

765
00:49:54,057 --> 00:49:56,958
- You know Allegra's gay, right?
- Of course.

766
00:49:58,362 --> 00:50:00,796
Oh. I love your furniture, in your house.

767
00:50:00,864 --> 00:50:03,628
<i>And before we do Northanger Abbey,
I gotta buy a couch, so...</i>

768
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:06,498
- Is something going on between these two?
- Grigg, you have to...

769
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:08,936
Would you come with me,
help me pick it out?

770
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:11,338
If you take Sylvia to lunch.

771
00:50:15,545 --> 00:50:16,705
Great.

772
00:50:17,381 --> 00:50:19,110
Good, that's great.

773
00:50:19,583 --> 00:50:21,244
- Okay, see you.
- All right, yup, here.

774
00:50:21,318 --> 00:50:23,411
- Take care.
- Oh, God. Sorry.

775
00:50:23,954 --> 00:50:26,445
I caught him staring at my titties.

776
00:50:28,825 --> 00:50:30,224
I like that.

777
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:39,298
- I like this.
- That color's difficult.

778
00:50:41,138 --> 00:50:44,198
I like things that are
difficult. I'll take it.

779
00:50:46,076 --> 00:50:48,374
Wait, you just don't buy
the first one you like.

780
00:50:48,445 --> 00:50:51,209
- You don't even know if it'll fit.
- What? It's fine.

781
00:50:51,281 --> 00:50:53,078
You getting hungry?

782
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:58,877
Grigg, I don't mean to be rude,
but may I ask,

783
00:50:59,256 --> 00:51:01,349
do you have a lot of money?

784
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:04,190
Never know how to answer that.

785
00:51:05,095 --> 00:51:06,960
Yeah, I have enough money.

786
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:10,022
But, you know,
I like working in tech support.

787
00:51:11,134 --> 00:51:12,601
- May I?
- Sure.

788
00:51:13,703 --> 00:51:15,568
You should bring Sylvia here.
It's so romantic.

789
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:17,732
You know, she's planning
this library fundraiser.

790
00:51:17,808 --> 00:51:19,673
- She's busy.
- Call her.

791
00:51:20,310 --> 00:51:22,175
It's hard to be alone.

792
00:51:26,183 --> 00:51:27,980
- Well, maybe her husband will come back.
- Maybe.

793
00:51:28,051 --> 00:51:30,212
Jane Austen should write that.

794
00:51:30,287 --> 00:51:32,482
<i>She did. In Persuasion.</i>

795
00:51:32,556 --> 00:51:36,219
Anne Eliot is in love with this guy
Wentworth who's in the navy, right?

796
00:51:36,293 --> 00:51:38,261
But her family thinks that
he's not good enough.

797
00:51:38,328 --> 00:51:39,659
- Right.
- So he leaves.

798
00:51:39,729 --> 00:51:41,560
And when he comes back
he's become this wealthy man.

799
00:51:41,631 --> 00:51:45,624
- But he's no longer in love with her.
- Okay. Don't tell me any more.

800
00:51:45,702 --> 00:51:51,072
- Oh, so you're enjoying the Austen, I see.
- Yeah. And how's the Ursula Le Guin?

801
00:51:53,477 --> 00:51:56,469
- You didn't like Le Guin?
- I didn't read them.

802
00:51:56,913 --> 00:51:58,904
How are you gonna know what you like
unless you try?

803
00:51:58,982 --> 00:52:00,313
I think at my age I should know what I like.

804
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:01,509
Age? Come on, age.

805
00:52:01,585 --> 00:52:02,916
Age has nothing to do with anything.

806
00:52:02,986 --> 00:52:06,183
I was willing to read girly books
like Jane Austen...

807
00:52:06,256 --> 00:52:07,280
She is not girly.

808
00:52:07,357 --> 00:52:08,949
Which I found out.

809
00:52:09,025 --> 00:52:11,892
So maybe you would find out
that science fiction's not just...

810
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:14,294
- Aliens on rocket ships.
- Right.

811
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:19,796
All right, hurry up and finish.
I'm gonna show you something really cool.

812
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:22,338
What you have to understand
is that when I was a kid,
