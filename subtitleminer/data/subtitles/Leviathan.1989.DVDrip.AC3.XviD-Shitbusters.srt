1
00:03:22,292 --> 00:03:26,023
Four to shack.
Container 14 ready to winch.

2
00:03:27,497 --> 00:03:30,955
Six to shack.
Silver extraction completed.

3
00:03:36,773 --> 00:03:39,799
Tha's good eating.
Burritos, enchiladas...

4
00:03:39,876 --> 00:03:43,744
Black beans and rice, man.
That's Puerto Rican. I gotta take you...

5
00:03:43,813 --> 00:03:47,112
I hate to break up
the great Latino gourmet debate...

6
00:03:47,183 --> 00:03:50,118
but we ain't off the clock yet.

7
00:03:50,186 --> 00:03:54,520
Since we got a few more days here,
can somebody...

8
00:03:54,591 --> 00:03:57,526
please tell me who the hook is?

9
00:03:57,594 --> 00:04:00,119
Fifteen, is that you?

10
00:04:00,196 --> 00:04:03,222
You got a hook on box 22?

11
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:06,200
The man is asking you
if you're hooked on 22, dumb shit.

12
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:08,635
Watch your mouth, Sixpack.
Fifteen to shack.

13
00:04:08,705 --> 00:04:10,832
This is Jones.
I ain't the hook.

14
00:04:10,907 --> 00:04:12,841
Seven to shack. I'm the hook.

15
00:04:12,909 --> 00:04:15,742
Okay there, seven.
Pack up box 22 and call it a day.

16
00:04:15,812 --> 00:04:18,872
Hey, Willie, you trip on a tit
or something? We're all waitin' on ya.

17
00:04:18,948 --> 00:04:20,506
Go suck on a shrimp, Sixpack.

18
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,727
Seven to shack.
Ready to winch.

19
00:04:31,795 --> 00:04:34,161
There we go.
Winch on.

20
00:04:38,902 --> 00:04:40,836
Okay, miners, let's come on home.

21
00:04:40,904 --> 00:04:42,735
You heard the man.
Let's get movin'.

22
00:04:42,806 --> 00:04:45,001
Come on, guys.
We only have three days left.

23
00:04:45,074 --> 00:04:47,008
I hear that.

24
00:04:55,819 --> 00:04:58,515
Put the kettle on, Beck.
We're coming home.

25
00:05:19,542 --> 00:05:21,840
Well, Doc,
not so as you'd notice...

26
00:05:21,911 --> 00:05:24,379
but the sun has set
on yet another day...

27
00:05:24,447 --> 00:05:27,780
of hard labor and toil
here at the homestead.

28
00:05:27,851 --> 00:05:32,618
Sixteen tons
and what do you get

29
00:05:32,689 --> 00:05:35,487
Another day older
and deeper in debt

30
00:05:35,558 --> 00:05:38,118
Saint Peter, don't you call me
'cause I can't go

31
00:05:38,194 --> 00:05:41,493
I owe my soul to the company store

32
00:05:50,473 --> 00:05:53,738
Jonesy! Help!

33
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:55,141
Cobb!

34
00:05:55,211 --> 00:05:57,179
My rebreather's stopped!
I'm losing compression!

35
00:05:57,247 --> 00:05:59,681
I'm gonna blow my suit!
Doc! Beck!

36
00:05:59,749 --> 00:06:02,479
Yeah, I got you, DeJesus.
You look fine from in here.

37
00:06:02,552 --> 00:06:04,850
- Give me a readout.
- My rebreather's stopped!

38
00:06:04,921 --> 00:06:07,617
I'm losing compression!
I can't breathe!

39
00:06:09,359 --> 00:06:11,554
I can't get an accurate readout
if you panic.

40
00:06:11,628 --> 00:06:14,927
Doc, we got an emergency here.
We need you. Got trouble.

41
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,665
So just breathe slowly
and through your nose...

42
00:06:20,737 --> 00:06:22,898
and out through your mouth.

43
00:06:22,972 --> 00:06:24,963
I think you're hyperventilating.

44
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:28,272
- Hyperventilating, my ass!
- How do you do this?

45
00:06:28,344 --> 00:06:30,278
- He's gonna blow.
- No, he's not gonna blow!

46
00:06:32,949 --> 00:06:34,883
Doc, come on!

47
00:06:38,154 --> 00:06:40,486
- Check his oxygen level.
- Yeah, I'm doin' that.

48
00:06:40,557 --> 00:06:43,390
- Do something, quick!
- I'm doin' it.

49
00:06:48,364 --> 00:06:49,956
Help!

50
00:06:51,367 --> 00:06:52,459
Damn!

51
00:06:54,737 --> 00:06:56,637
Hook him to my RV-four transpac.

52
00:06:56,706 --> 00:06:58,867
Right. Hook him to the RV...

53
00:06:58,942 --> 00:07:01,809
No! Don't do that!
Don't circumventilate him.

54
00:07:01,878 --> 00:07:04,608
I think you're risking
an implosion probability.

55
00:07:04,681 --> 00:07:07,514
Doc, we need you.
Bring him into the shack.

56
00:07:07,584 --> 00:07:10,610
- There's not enough time!
- You've got time. Just do it.

57
00:07:10,687 --> 00:07:12,211
I'm gonna die!

58
00:07:12,288 --> 00:07:14,586
You ain't gonna die.

59
00:07:21,331 --> 00:07:23,322
Just keep him moving.

60
00:07:26,736 --> 00:07:29,603
Take it easy. We'll make it.

61
00:07:33,242 --> 00:07:35,233
Open the damn door.

62
00:07:38,815 --> 00:07:41,340
Come on! Get him inside!

63
00:07:50,193 --> 00:07:52,559
Keep him moving.

64
00:08:01,537 --> 00:08:04,131
Come on, lift lock. Go.

65
00:08:04,207 --> 00:08:06,232
Come on, lift lock. Up.

66
00:09:08,871 --> 00:09:12,034
Rebreathers. I don't trust anything that
doesn't have bubbles comin' out of it.

67
00:09:12,108 --> 00:09:14,042
It ain't the goddamn suit, man.
It's Beck.

68
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:17,546
It's not his fault.
Doc shoulïve been there.

69
00:09:17,613 --> 00:09:19,774
If he was a real shack boss,
Doc would have been there.

70
00:09:19,849 --> 00:09:21,476
He got real lucky.

71
00:09:21,551 --> 00:09:24,987
Hey, Wall Street broke
the 15,000-point barrier today.

72
00:09:27,056 --> 00:09:28,990
Shit. There goes my bonus.

73
00:09:30,426 --> 00:09:32,519
You know, I stood next to a guy
who blew a suit once.

74
00:09:32,595 --> 00:09:35,325
He was in the Indian Ocean.

75
00:09:35,398 --> 00:09:37,832
- That is not a pretty sight.
- Leave Hazy alone, man.

76
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:41,563
One tiny little hole
in the fucking toe of his suit.

77
00:09:41,637 --> 00:09:43,969
No bigger than your dick.

78
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,372
Yeah, that ocean came in.

79
00:09:46,442 --> 00:09:50,503
The pressure just crammed
his whole body up into his helmet.

80
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,514
We just buried his helmet.

81
00:09:54,817 --> 00:09:58,719
- That woulïve been you, DeJesus.
- Hey, I know about implosion.

82
00:09:58,788 --> 00:10:02,315
Yeah, I bet you do.
I bet you was imploding in your pants.

83
00:10:02,391 --> 00:10:05,519
- Knock it off, Sixpack!
- Cut it out, you guys.

84
00:10:05,595 --> 00:10:08,621
We've been stuck down in this hole
for a hell of a long time.

85
00:10:08,698 --> 00:10:12,566
We had a close call. We're not gonna
let something like this break us apart.

86
00:10:12,635 --> 00:10:15,502
The doc is my responsibility.

87
00:10:20,877 --> 00:10:22,811
Bullshit.

88
00:10:37,326 --> 00:10:42,127
It would be just my luck to finish two
months' worth of work two miles under...

89
00:10:42,198 --> 00:10:44,530
and have the whole place fall apart
with just three days left.

90
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,534
Anyone check weather up top?

91
00:10:46,602 --> 00:10:49,435
It's raining, but it's
supposed to be clear for pickup.

92
00:10:49,505 --> 00:10:51,473
As long as there's no waves.
I hate waves.

93
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:55,739
Waves my ass. Do you know what you'd
be doin' if you were up top right now?

94
00:10:55,812 --> 00:10:57,803
Drinkin' brew and eatin' pussy.

95
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:01,611
- How about gettin' stuck in traffic?
- Wherever I can find it.

96
00:11:01,684 --> 00:11:03,618
I'll tell you what you'd be doing.

97
00:11:03,686 --> 00:11:06,484
Be watching news on TV that's so bad,
it makes you nauseous.

98
00:11:06,556 --> 00:11:09,787
So bad that you get in your car
to get some fresh air...

99
00:11:09,859 --> 00:11:12,020
and after five minutes,
you realize...

100
00:11:12,094 --> 00:11:15,222
the air's so dirty,
you can't breathe.

101
00:11:15,298 --> 00:11:18,995
If you're lucky enough
to get back to your house...

102
00:11:19,068 --> 00:11:21,696
that looks the same
as everybody else's...

103
00:11:21,771 --> 00:11:24,899
you find that your wife
is as fat as she ever was.

104
00:11:24,974 --> 00:11:27,169
And the only reason your kids
aren't strung out on the drugs...

105
00:11:27,243 --> 00:11:30,269
they were using is because
they've found some new drugs...

106
00:11:30,346 --> 00:11:33,645
which screw 'em up even more,
and that's just the good part.

107
00:11:33,716 --> 00:11:35,946
You people don't appreciate
how good you've got it down here.

108
00:11:38,454 --> 00:11:41,651
- Don't let me interrupt you, Mr. Cobb.
- That's all right. I was just finished.

109
00:11:41,724 --> 00:11:45,125
- How are you feeling there?
- I'm okay.

110
00:11:45,194 --> 00:11:47,662
- See the doc yet?
- No.

111
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:50,164
Well, you better let the doc
take a look at you after dinner.

112
00:11:50,233 --> 00:11:52,701
- Since he was busy earlier.
- When we needed him.

113
00:11:52,768 --> 00:11:55,168
Why don't you let me
handle the doc.

114
00:11:55,238 --> 00:11:57,672
Makes me feel better already.

115
00:11:59,342 --> 00:12:02,641
I was looking at the shack
maintenance hours outstanding.

116
00:12:02,712 --> 00:12:05,044
I see where this is going.

117
00:12:05,114 --> 00:12:09,778
All of us owe some shack maintenance
time. Tonight would be a good time.

118
00:12:09,852 --> 00:12:12,685
No way, Mr. Beck.
No bleepin' way.

119
00:12:12,755 --> 00:12:15,986
You can't call shack duty
on top of a full shift.

120
00:12:16,058 --> 00:12:17,992
That's a union violation.
It's in the contract.

121
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:21,552
Right on, Cobb.
Let's hear it for the shop steward.

122
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:24,566
Hear that, Becky? The company's
got to abide by the rules.

123
00:12:24,634 --> 00:12:27,831
I know about the contract.
You can follow the letter...

124
00:12:27,904 --> 00:12:30,395
of the contract to the law and spend
an extra workday gettin' it done...

125
00:12:30,473 --> 00:12:32,964
or you can get it done tonight
and call tomorrow a down day.

126
00:12:33,042 --> 00:12:36,170
- What, are you giving us the day off?
- Looks that way.

127
00:12:36,245 --> 00:12:38,304
What about our quota?

128
00:12:38,381 --> 00:12:41,248
You're only 25 tons off quota.

129
00:12:41,317 --> 00:12:43,785
You're bound to go way over that
by the last day.

130
00:12:43,853 --> 00:12:47,482
Look, folks, it's just a day off.
It don't make no difference to me.

131
00:12:47,556 --> 00:12:50,047
It's just up to you.
I thought it might be good.

132
00:12:50,126 --> 00:12:52,356
- Hell, I could use a day off.
- Me too.

133
00:12:52,428 --> 00:12:56,831
- What the hell.
- Okay, shop stewarïs three.

134
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,869
- Four.
- Four. Anybody else?

135
00:13:00,937 --> 00:13:03,132
- Six.
- All right, here's what we got.

136
00:13:04,807 --> 00:13:07,332
Mr. Cobb, we still got that rattle
in the air duct somewhere.

137
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:09,344
- Take a look at that.
- Okay.

138
00:13:09,412 --> 00:13:12,438
Williams, run a diagnostic
on DeJesus's suit.

139
00:13:12,515 --> 00:13:15,609
- Anybody else got any suit problems?
- Yeah, my pocket.

140
00:13:15,685 --> 00:13:18,779
Can you check my pocket, sweetheart?

141
00:13:22,525 --> 00:13:24,823
Good evening. Name's Thompson.
Party of one.

142
00:13:24,894 --> 00:13:28,261
My reservation was 8:15.
Not too near the orchestra, please.

143
00:13:28,331 --> 00:13:30,299
Are you gonna come
to work tomorrow, Doc?

144
00:13:30,366 --> 00:13:32,300
No, I'll be on the golf course
in the morning.

145
00:13:32,368 --> 00:13:34,427
Then, if I don't have
any babies to deliver...

146
00:13:34,503 --> 00:13:36,903
I could stop by after lunch.

147
00:13:36,973 --> 00:13:40,374
We almost had an accident today.
DeJesus's suit.

148
00:13:41,477 --> 00:13:43,411
You have something
to say to me?

149
00:13:43,479 --> 00:13:45,777
Yeah. Section 1412...

150
00:13:45,848 --> 00:13:48,339
of the Tri-Oceanic manual requires...

151
00:13:48,417 --> 00:13:52,285
a mining shack's medical officer
to be present in the control room...

152
00:13:52,355 --> 00:13:54,619
during all exterior operations.

153
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:57,318
I just wanna make real damn sure
that's clear.

154
00:14:03,232 --> 00:14:05,427
I'll keep it to nine holes
in the morning.

155
00:14:09,071 --> 00:14:12,404
Thank you, sir, for taking care
of that situation.

156
00:14:57,286 --> 00:15:00,983
- Listen to it, for Christ's sake.
- It's just gettin' old, that's all.

157
00:15:01,057 --> 00:15:05,551
You don't see Doc opening me up
every time my joints start to creak.

158
00:15:05,628 --> 00:15:08,791
As long as it's recycling
the air, let it be. Come on.

159
00:15:08,864 --> 00:15:11,799
Ten to one it's a short.

160
00:15:22,344 --> 00:15:24,278
Piece of cake.

161
00:15:29,118 --> 00:15:31,052
Great.

162
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:04,349
Oh, mama! What a pair.

163
00:16:05,621 --> 00:16:07,213
What'd you say?

164
00:16:08,524 --> 00:16:10,515
I said, "What a pair."

165
00:16:10,593 --> 00:16:15,394
Our shack boss and his washed-up
doctor buddy make quite a...

166
00:16:15,464 --> 00:16:18,297
- What did you think I said?
- That you liked my boobs.

167
00:16:22,972 --> 00:16:26,237
You watch the old Cobb magic,
all right?

168
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:29,944
Compliments of Bowman.

169
00:16:40,856 --> 00:16:42,323
Yeah.

170
00:16:47,897 --> 00:16:49,956
How in the hell did you do that?

171
00:16:50,032 --> 00:16:53,331
You don't say anything to anybody.
Job security.

172
00:16:53,402 --> 00:16:56,030
All right? Let's go.

173
00:16:56,105 --> 00:16:59,404
Now, wait a minute, man.
How in the hell did you do that?

174
00:17:03,913 --> 00:17:05,847
That's clean.

175
00:17:07,783 --> 00:17:09,751
But there's nothing wrong with it.
Oh, my God!

176
00:17:15,157 --> 00:17:17,387
Come here, Kuki.

177
00:17:18,928 --> 00:17:20,862
Sixpack, you shit!

178
00:17:24,867 --> 00:17:26,835
Surprise!

179
00:17:26,902 --> 00:17:30,497
How much silver are we gonna
start taking out of that mine again?

180
00:17:30,573 --> 00:17:33,508
Well, Martin, I think you've got
an honest-to-God bonanza on your hands.

181
00:17:33,576 --> 00:17:36,511
You can haul us out in a couple of days.
This mine will play itself.

182
00:17:36,579 --> 00:17:39,104
When I told the Director
of Atlantic Operations...

183
00:17:39,181 --> 00:17:43,550
that we had to stick a geologist
down there and turn that mine around...

184
00:17:43,619 --> 00:17:47,453
I had no idea that you were going
to prove me a genius.

185
00:17:47,523 --> 00:17:50,492
- Well, I'm glad you're happy.
- I'm ecstatic.

186
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,652
'Cause I can't wait
to get the fuck outta here.

187
00:17:52,728 --> 00:17:54,161
What?

188
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:57,961
I said, I really can't wait
to get back to exploration diving.

189
00:17:58,033 --> 00:17:59,967
I miss the research, and...

190
00:18:00,035 --> 00:18:03,596
By the way, I ran that check
on Dr. Thompson.

191
00:18:03,672 --> 00:18:06,539
He has a few incidences
of insubordination...

192
00:18:06,609 --> 00:18:10,409
but his credentials
are very impressive.

193
00:18:10,479 --> 00:18:13,710
Pharmacology.
He pioneered several vaccines.

194
00:18:13,782 --> 00:18:15,909
Well, this ain't the Mayo Clinic.
How'd he get down here?

195
00:18:17,019 --> 00:18:19,214
A serum he developed
killed several people.

196
00:18:19,288 --> 00:18:22,519
An accident, but it got blown
all out of proportion.

197
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,990
Now, look.

198
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:26,493
Things are beginning to move
very fast now.

199
00:18:26,562 --> 00:18:29,531
If you're having a problem with him
or you need any help...

200
00:18:29,598 --> 00:18:31,793
just say the word.

201
00:18:34,203 --> 00:18:36,569
No, I don't think
it's anything I can't handle.

202
00:18:36,639 --> 00:18:37,936
Good.

203
00:18:40,576 --> 00:18:43,511
How are your stocks doin'?
Haven't you made your million yet?

204
00:18:43,579 --> 00:18:45,740
Not yet.

205
00:18:45,814 --> 00:18:50,513
- How's Tri-Oceanic doing, Bow?
- Got money in this tub?

206
00:18:50,586 --> 00:18:54,078
Yeah. I signed up
for the stock option.

207
00:18:54,156 --> 00:18:56,624
Last year when they lost a tanker,
the bottom fell out of their stock.

208
00:18:56,692 --> 00:18:58,717
I lost a bloody fortune.

209
00:18:58,794 --> 00:19:00,728
You take your money too seriously.

210
00:19:15,678 --> 00:19:20,581
You're damn right, I do.
I'm not down here for fun.

211
00:19:20,649 --> 00:19:23,982
Fun? Somebody talkin' fun?

212
00:19:25,421 --> 00:19:27,685
Look at those white legs!

213
00:19:27,756 --> 00:19:31,089
Hey, Willie, I'm sorry
about that little incident tonight.

214
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,994
You know, I just thought
a little humor might loosen things up.

215
00:19:36,432 --> 00:19:37,990
Hey, watch it!

216
00:19:39,068 --> 00:19:40,797
No hard feelings?

217
00:19:40,869 --> 00:19:43,599
Nope. Sweet dreams.

218
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:51,145
I got a date with an angel.

219
00:20:01,924 --> 00:20:03,516
Come on, baby.

220
00:20:03,592 --> 00:20:05,526
Sit on my face.

221
00:20:15,671 --> 00:20:19,471
Goddamn it, Williams! You bitch!

222
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:23,136
Look at my foot!
Look at my goddamn foot!

223
00:20:23,212 --> 00:20:25,680
- I thought you'd find that funny.
- You think it's funny?

224
00:20:25,748 --> 00:20:28,182
You're gonna think it's funny
when you eat this goddamn thing!

225
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:31,117
- What the hell's goin' on here?
- Look at my foot!

226
00:20:31,186 --> 00:20:33,882
This bitch put a goddamn
sea monster in my bunk!

227
00:20:33,956 --> 00:20:36,356
- How do you know it was her?
- It was her!

228
00:20:36,425 --> 00:20:39,394
- Are you calling me a liar?
- That may be the size of it, Bubba.

229
00:20:39,461 --> 00:20:43,158
- You two just pulled sea duty tomorrow.
- Bullshit!

230
00:20:43,232 --> 00:20:45,564
Oh, geez! Will you pipe down?

231
00:20:46,735 --> 00:20:49,363
You just got half a day.
Any more hoopla, it's a full one.

232
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:55,576
Ready to drill.

233
00:20:59,915 --> 00:21:01,849
Looks like a nice vein of ore.

234
00:21:01,917 --> 00:21:03,851
- Let's blow it.
- Blow this.

235
00:21:07,589 --> 00:21:09,022
Charge activated.

236
00:21:09,091 --> 00:21:11,582
Hey, Willie, remind you of anything?

237
00:21:17,199 --> 00:21:18,723
Oh, yeah!

238
00:21:25,908 --> 00:21:27,899
It looks like the mother lode, guys.

239
00:21:33,115 --> 00:21:35,049
I need more light on that, seven.

240
00:21:36,118 --> 00:21:39,781
Sixpack, you hear that?
We need more light.

241
00:21:43,091 --> 00:21:45,787
All right, look.

242
00:21:45,861 --> 00:21:47,226
My cable's stuck.

243
00:21:56,638 --> 00:21:59,607
Sixpack, What's happened?

244
00:21:59,675 --> 00:22:02,439
We've lost him.

245
00:22:02,511 --> 00:22:05,412
Well, what are you doing?
Having a party out there?

246
00:22:05,481 --> 00:22:07,415
Beck, I'm looking for him.

247
00:22:13,755 --> 00:22:17,054
Shack to seven.
What's going on out there?

248
00:22:20,496 --> 00:22:21,895
He's gone.

249
00:22:21,964 --> 00:22:24,899
Williams, speak to me.
What's happening out there?

250
00:22:27,903 --> 00:22:30,269
Sixpack, answer.

251
00:22:30,339 --> 00:22:32,068
Oh, my God!

252
00:22:34,109 --> 00:22:38,045
Come on, Williams.
What's the alternate?

253
00:22:38,113 --> 00:22:40,047
Try 35.

254
00:22:40,115 --> 00:22:42,049
Williams? There she is.

255
00:22:46,321 --> 00:22:48,255
Williams, you hear me?
What's going on out there?

256
00:22:48,323 --> 00:22:50,257
He's gone over the South Ridge.

257
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:57,660
I'm going down after him.

258
00:22:57,733 --> 00:23:00,361
Watch yourself, 'cause we don't know
what the hell is over that ridge.

259
00:23:00,435 --> 00:23:02,869
Come on, Jonesy, work it out.

260
00:23:05,541 --> 00:23:08,101
- Sixpack's lost!
- Weren't they tied?

261
00:23:08,176 --> 00:23:10,110
- I don't know!
- They're supposed to be tied.

262
00:23:10,178 --> 00:23:12,646
- Come on. Let's go.
- Move it!

263
00:23:12,714 --> 00:23:14,648
Oh, God!

264
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:23,382
What've we got?

265
00:23:27,229 --> 00:23:29,459
- Tube worms.
- How's she gonna get out?

266
00:23:36,772 --> 00:23:39,707
Bowman, What's the self-contained
air capacity of that suit?

267
00:23:39,775 --> 00:23:41,709
Thirty minutes.

268
00:23:48,216 --> 00:23:50,150
This is six to shack.

269
00:23:54,156 --> 00:23:57,353
For Goïs sakes, why doesn't
Sixpack have his blinkers on?

270
00:23:57,426 --> 00:24:00,224
The man could be two feet away
and on fire and she wouldn't see him.

271
00:24:07,569 --> 00:24:09,002
What?

272
00:24:09,071 --> 00:24:11,005
What is this?

273
00:24:13,775 --> 00:24:15,709
A ship?

274
00:24:46,942 --> 00:24:48,375
That's Russian.

275
00:24:51,346 --> 00:24:53,075
Are you picking this up?

276
00:24:53,148 --> 00:24:56,413
Yeah, we got it. Can you open up
that picture a little for us?

277
00:24:59,187 --> 00:25:00,779
Leviathan.

278
00:25:00,856 --> 00:25:04,053
- What?
- Leviathan.

279
00:25:04,126 --> 00:25:06,060
- Bowman, run a check.
- Sir.

280
00:25:08,196 --> 00:25:11,495
- Williams, What's your air reading?
- Twenty minutes.

281
00:25:11,566 --> 00:25:14,228
We're gonna give you five,
then we're coming in.

282
00:25:14,302 --> 00:25:16,236
Jones, Cobb, suit up.

283
00:25:25,814 --> 00:25:27,748
I'm going inside.

284
00:25:38,894 --> 00:25:41,192
Sixpack, answer me!

285
00:25:50,105 --> 00:25:52,096
Baltic Sea?

286
00:26:02,918 --> 00:26:04,852
What have you got there, Bowman?

287
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:08,583
The Leviathan. Currently with
the Russian Fleet in the Baltic Sea.

288
00:26:08,657 --> 00:26:11,854
Currently horseshit. Currently it's
rusted junk, and we're lookin' at it.

289
00:26:11,927 --> 00:26:14,862
Well, it's gotta be wrong.
Maybe you didn't enter it correctly.

290
00:26:16,098 --> 00:26:18,123
It's right here.
The Baltic Sea.

291
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,397
Maybe a ship sinks
and they don't notice it's missing.

292
00:26:22,571 --> 00:26:26,200
Williams, you got one minute to find
Sixpack and get your butt out of there.

293
00:26:31,413 --> 00:26:36,077
If Willie's got a minute,
how much time does Sixpack have?

294
00:27:10,318 --> 00:27:11,785
The infirmary.

295
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:40,109
I'm rich, honey!

296
00:27:42,851 --> 00:27:46,252
Safety negligence?
I never even heard a word.

297
00:27:46,321 --> 00:27:48,983
How can I be on report?
Ain't that right, Cobby?

298
00:27:49,057 --> 00:27:51,787
Don't Cobby me.
You're on your own this time.

299
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:53,794
You almost fucked up everybody's day.

300
00:27:54,763 --> 00:27:57,561
A Timex. And it's still ticking.

301
00:27:57,632 --> 00:28:00,931
A little Russian money.
It don't look like much.

302
00:28:01,002 --> 00:28:03,835
Here's something for you, Bow.

303
00:28:06,308 --> 00:28:08,776
Hey, Sixpack,
look at your girlfriends.

304
00:28:19,354 --> 00:28:22,152
- What's that?
- "Kitty Does Kiev."

305
00:28:22,224 --> 00:28:23,919
- Porn. Right up your alley.
- Let me see that.

306
00:28:23,992 --> 00:28:25,823
It's in Russian.
I don't know what it says.

307
00:28:25,894 --> 00:28:29,159
- May I see it, please?
- It's not really "Kitty Does Kiev."

308
00:28:31,499 --> 00:28:35,663
- It's the captain's log on videotape.
- Don't tell me you read Russian.

309
00:28:35,737 --> 00:28:38,865
Russian, German, Italian, Spanish...

310
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:41,465
French, a little Swahili
and a smattering of Hindi.

311
00:28:41,543 --> 00:28:44,341
- It's part of my premed background.
- Bullshit.

312
00:28:44,412 --> 00:28:46,607
Would you believe
a Russian grandmother?

313
00:28:46,681 --> 00:28:49,343
That I believe.

314
00:28:49,417 --> 00:28:53,217
- What's this?
- Personal effects. Can you read that?

315
00:28:54,289 --> 00:28:55,722
Deceased.

316
00:28:58,293 --> 00:29:00,227
What's all this?

317
00:29:02,697 --> 00:29:04,289
Deceased.

318
00:29:12,941 --> 00:29:14,875
Deceased. All of them.

319
00:29:16,778 --> 00:29:19,338
- Mr. Cobb, wrap all that up.
- Right.

320
00:29:19,414 --> 00:29:21,348
DeJesus, dump this last box.

321
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:29,354
That's nice.
What is this? Vodka.

322
00:29:29,424 --> 00:29:32,359
Stresnavga.
Hey, that's good stuff.

323
00:29:32,427 --> 00:29:34,554
Make for a great end-of-shift party.

324
00:29:34,629 --> 00:29:37,097
If I'm on report,
I guess this bottle's mine, huh?

325
00:29:37,165 --> 00:29:39,360
Well, I guess you're right.
It is yours.

326
00:29:39,434 --> 00:29:43,530
But it's pilferage, so now you're down
for two counts of safety negligence...

327
00:29:43,605 --> 00:29:46,335
for risking Williams's life,
going on that boat and possessing...

328
00:29:46,408 --> 00:29:48,103
restricted material.

329
00:29:48,176 --> 00:29:50,371
- All this gets impounded.
- It's done.

330
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:56,750
And one more thing.

331
00:29:56,818 --> 00:30:00,652
I think if I hear you
call me "Becky" one more time...

332
00:30:00,722 --> 00:30:04,123
I'm gonna pop your tops...
all six of 'em.

333
00:30:19,341 --> 00:30:22,071
My infirmary's filled.

334
00:30:23,078 --> 00:30:25,706
The doctors on board tell me
it's like a tropical infection.

335
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:31,278
But it's not like anything
I've ever seen before.

336
00:30:33,092 --> 00:30:36,160
And there's something else
I don't understand.

337
00:30:36,325 --> 00:30:38,725
And then it goes off.

338
00:30:39,194 --> 00:30:42,493
So what do you want me to say?
It all sounds mysterious?

339
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:47,393
Well, why did he leave his log tape?

340
00:30:47,469 --> 00:30:49,960
Why are there two ships with
the same name in different places?

341
00:30:50,038 --> 00:30:53,303
Hell, I don't know. You read Russian.
Maybe you read it wrong.

342
00:30:53,375 --> 00:30:56,503
I didn't. Even if I had, there
should be a record of some ship...

343
00:30:56,578 --> 00:30:59,809
that's sunk within 100 miles of here,
and there's not.

344
00:31:08,523 --> 00:31:11,424
And look at this tear.
This hole in the hull.

345
00:31:13,595 --> 00:31:18,498
That's the result of an explosion.
I think that was a torpedo hit.

346
00:31:19,734 --> 00:31:21,702
I think that ship
was sunk on purpose.

347
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:25,536
Now how the hell do you know
that's a torpedo hit?

348
00:31:25,607 --> 00:31:27,632
A collision with another boat
can produce that hole.

349
00:31:27,709 --> 00:31:29,700
I don't agree with you.

350
00:31:29,778 --> 00:31:31,712
- This hole would not be so jagged...
- So what?

351
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:34,214
So what if they scuttle
their own boat?

352
00:31:34,282 --> 00:31:36,978
I can't get bent outta shape
just because some people...

353
00:31:37,052 --> 00:31:40,818
got some jungle rot and ended up dead
on a barge on the bottom of the ocean.

354
00:31:40,889 --> 00:31:45,292
I know about rocks. I know about stones.
I don't know about Russian boats.

355
00:31:46,795 --> 00:31:49,355
Plus, I bet you five dollars
it's a clerical error.

356
00:31:49,431 --> 00:31:53,162
Hell, we sounded the horn on it.
Let the maritime people figure it out.

357
00:31:53,234 --> 00:31:56,067
I gotta fix the lift lock.

358
00:31:56,137 --> 00:31:59,072
Okay, two more days.

359
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:01,301
Let's have no waves.

360
00:32:01,376 --> 00:32:05,142
Weather system on line.
Tracking meteorological patterns.

361
00:32:05,213 --> 00:32:08,614
- Beginning scan.
- I hate...

362
00:32:08,683 --> 00:32:10,412
waves.

363
00:32:12,887 --> 00:32:16,084
You know that in Switzerland,
they speak four major languages?

364
00:32:16,157 --> 00:32:19,149
- Ask me if I care.
- I do.

365
00:32:19,227 --> 00:32:21,821
When I get outta here,
I'm goin' there.

366
00:32:21,896 --> 00:32:24,490
I'm gonna find a nice
snow-covered chalet...

367
00:32:24,566 --> 00:32:29,162
warm little woman,
crackling fire, and ski.

368
00:32:32,774 --> 00:32:36,733
If you're gonna do that, you should
wear what you wear to the beach.

369
00:32:36,811 --> 00:32:38,210
I hate the beach.

370
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:41,248
Hey, guys. Look what I got.

371
00:32:41,316 --> 00:32:43,511
- I don't believe it. You got 'em.
- Yeah, put it there.

372
00:32:45,386 --> 00:32:47,650
What are you doing
with Beck's personnel records?

373
00:32:47,722 --> 00:32:49,246
Watch. You'll see.

374
00:32:49,324 --> 00:32:53,283
Four, zero, five, four...

375
00:32:53,361 --> 00:32:54,851
eight, six.

376
00:32:54,929 --> 00:32:58,228
You guys are so full of shit.
How stupid do you think he is?

377
00:32:58,299 --> 00:33:00,358
Who's gonna use
their social security number?

378
00:33:03,872 --> 00:33:06,067
Bingo!

379
00:33:06,141 --> 00:33:07,540
That bottle's mine.

380
00:33:07,609 --> 00:33:11,067
- Cute, DeJesus. Specimen cups?
- Loosen up, Bow.

381
00:33:11,146 --> 00:33:14,411
- Hey, Willie, got one poured for you.
- Not for me, thanks.

382
00:33:14,482 --> 00:33:16,643
All you do is exercise.
You gotta live a little.

383
00:33:16,718 --> 00:33:18,652
My astronaut training
starts in two days.

384
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,950
Forget space cadet.
I'll drink hers.

385
00:33:21,022 --> 00:33:24,458
What happens if he goes back
and finds the bottle missing?

386
00:33:24,526 --> 00:33:27,256
He won't.
I put the vodka in here.

387
00:33:27,328 --> 00:33:29,558
Smart lad.

388
00:33:29,631 --> 00:33:31,155
Cheers.

389
00:33:34,536 --> 00:33:36,561
- It's water.
- Beck switched it.

390
00:33:36,638 --> 00:33:38,572
That son of a gun
doesn't trust us.

391
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,165
That pretty-boy little turd.
I'm gonna fix his ass.

392
00:33:41,242 --> 00:33:43,574
- There goes our party.
- It's not bad.

393
00:33:43,645 --> 00:33:46,079
- It's not bad at all.
- It's water.

394
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:09,194
Did I tell you
vodka's my favorite drink?

395
00:34:50,111 --> 00:34:52,045
That was a pretty big one, huh?

396
00:34:52,113 --> 00:34:54,445
You'd think we'd get
used to it by now.

397
00:34:54,515 --> 00:34:58,042
You're wasting your time here.
This needs a shutdown and an overhaul.

398
00:35:01,289 --> 00:35:05,350
Yeah, I need an overhaul.
How's the training goin'?

399
00:35:08,029 --> 00:35:10,259
It's going well.

400
00:35:10,331 --> 00:35:12,799
I think I've got a good shot.

401
00:35:12,867 --> 00:35:15,563
I just wish everyone would
stop giving me a hard time.

402
00:35:15,637 --> 00:35:18,265
Yeah, I know what you mean.

403
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:21,274
Why don't you give me a hand
and hit that button, huh?

404
00:35:24,779 --> 00:35:27,009
- Push D.L.
- What?

405
00:35:27,081 --> 00:35:29,015
D.L.

406
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:36,621
Oh, man.

407
00:35:40,995 --> 00:35:42,929
What are you doing down here?

408
00:35:42,997 --> 00:35:45,830
Well, I'm trying to fix
this short in the lift lock.

409
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:48,095
What are you doing down here?

410
00:35:48,169 --> 00:35:50,433
- You know what I mean.
- Yeah, I know what you mean.

411
00:35:50,505 --> 00:35:52,530
- You don't belong in a mine.
- You got that right.

412
00:35:53,875 --> 00:35:55,809
But somebody just got
the brilliant idea...

413
00:35:55,877 --> 00:35:58,607
to stick a geologist down here
in charge of you cowboys.

414
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,875
I think maybe they thought that
just 'cause I could tell...

415
00:36:00,948 --> 00:36:02,882
shit from silver,
I'd know how to run this place.

416
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:04,247
Do you?

417
00:36:06,454 --> 00:36:08,046
You tell me.

418
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:11,324
I think you handled
DeJesus pretty well.

419
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:13,986
Yeah?

420
00:36:14,062 --> 00:36:17,554
Well, that was luck.
I was scared to death.

421
00:36:18,366 --> 00:36:19,993
What about Sixpack?

422
00:36:21,736 --> 00:36:23,260
What about him?

423
00:36:24,706 --> 00:36:26,833
Did you bust him because of me?

424
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:30,072
Maybe.

425
00:36:32,013 --> 00:36:36,109
Well, I appreciate that.
But I'm okay.

426
00:36:38,286 --> 00:36:40,413
Yeah, I know.

427
00:36:43,591 --> 00:36:44,819
Good.

428
00:36:50,398 --> 00:36:54,129
Oh, by the way, how did you know
they'd get into the vodka?

429
00:36:57,071 --> 00:36:59,039
Hell, that's what I woulïve done.

430
00:37:01,676 --> 00:37:03,644
Maybe you're more one of us
than you think.

431
00:37:20,228 --> 00:37:22,162
Good morning.

432
00:37:24,632 --> 00:37:26,156
Sorry.

433
00:37:26,234 --> 00:37:30,136
Okay. That's good.

434
00:37:31,773 --> 00:37:34,003
Just look at my forehead.

435
00:37:34,075 --> 00:37:36,009
That's it.

436
00:37:41,149 --> 00:37:43,083
Let me see your tongue.

437
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,312
Good morning, gentlemen.
What's wrong, Doc?

438
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:54,191
I'm getting a pretty good
imitation of a hangover.

439
00:37:54,262 --> 00:37:56,492
- Take off your shirt.
- It ain't no hangover.

440
00:37:56,564 --> 00:37:58,998
Feels about 1000 times worse.

441
00:38:04,439 --> 00:38:06,373
How long did you have these spots?

442
00:38:06,441 --> 00:38:08,375
- What?
- Don't touch it.

443
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:20,514
Well, as First Officer of the shack,
it's your call.

444
00:38:20,588 --> 00:38:23,887
But if I were you,
I'd not be too hasty.

445
00:38:23,958 --> 00:38:25,425
I don't get it.

446
00:38:25,493 --> 00:38:30,396
Any evacuation 24 hours
before a scheduled pickup...

447
00:38:30,465 --> 00:38:33,957
won't look good on
an otherwise excellent record.

448
00:38:34,035 --> 00:38:37,027
But like I said, it's your call.

449
00:38:44,512 --> 00:38:46,605
Well, as bad as he is,
there's no way...

450
00:38:46,681 --> 00:38:49,673
we're gonna make that quota
without his sad self down there.

451
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:52,947
- He's tankin' on us.
- No, I don't think so.

452
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:56,012
I heard him last night,
and he didn't sound so good.

453
00:38:56,090 --> 00:38:59,253
The company will consider that
when they look at our numbers.

454
00:38:59,327 --> 00:39:03,093
Sweetheart, the company
doesn't give a damn about why.

455
00:39:03,164 --> 00:39:05,132
The contract says,
if we miss our quota...

456
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:07,759
they only gotta pay us half pay
for the entire month.

457
00:39:07,835 --> 00:39:09,769
Believe me, they'll stick to it.

458
00:39:09,837 --> 00:39:12,465
The bastarïs
definitely tanking on us.

459
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:15,168
- Yep, I think you're right.
- I wish you were, but he's not.

460
00:39:15,243 --> 00:39:17,177
He's really sick.
He ain't comin' out today.

461
00:39:17,245 --> 00:39:19,236
- Williams, take her down.
- That's terrific.

462
00:39:19,313 --> 00:39:22,908
- Three months of work down the tubes.
- You're outta here, guys.

463
00:39:22,984 --> 00:39:26,283
So, what, are you taking inventory?

464
00:39:26,354 --> 00:39:29,187
No, Mr. Jones.
I'm getting ready to play Ping-Pong.

465
00:39:32,627 --> 00:39:35,289
I'm goin' to work.
You got a problem with that?

466
00:39:35,363 --> 00:39:37,160
- Work?
- Work.

467
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:52,608
- Try to hold as steady as you can.
- What the hell is it?

468
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:55,171
- I'm taking a little skin sample.
- Come on. Give me something.

469
00:39:55,249 --> 00:39:57,274
Just a second.
Steady as you can.

470
00:39:57,351 --> 00:40:00,787
Try to do it as quick as I can.
That's it. I got it.

471
00:40:00,855 --> 00:40:03,881
Steady, steady. Easy.

472
00:40:06,594 --> 00:40:09,995
It's all right.
Keep your hands off it.

473
00:40:10,064 --> 00:40:11,998
Here. Hold that.

474
00:40:14,302 --> 00:40:16,896
I'm gonna take a look at this
under the microscope.

475
00:40:52,106 --> 00:40:54,165
Container 22 is full, sir.

476
00:40:54,241 --> 00:40:56,835
This one's full, so let's run her
outta here and bring in a new one.

477
00:40:56,911 --> 00:40:58,708
You got it.

478
00:41:14,095 --> 00:41:17,121
"An organism of unknown origin."
No kidding.

479
00:41:17,198 --> 00:41:19,758
Tell me something I don't know.

480
00:41:27,208 --> 00:41:28,766
Goddamn it, take a guess.

481
00:42:33,574 --> 00:42:37,169
Good work out there, Becky.
I mean, Mr. Beck.

482
00:42:37,244 --> 00:42:39,178
Not bad, Mr. Beck.

483
00:42:40,314 --> 00:42:43,147
No harm done.

484
00:42:43,217 --> 00:42:45,151
Just don't call me cracker.

485
00:42:46,087 --> 00:42:48,214
Perk up, sport.

486
00:42:48,289 --> 00:42:52,555
How can the guy die
from a skin rash in eight hours?

487
00:42:54,361 --> 00:42:57,524
Put this on.
I want you to examine him.

488
00:42:57,598 --> 00:43:00,658
- I'm not a doctor.
- For this, you don't need to be.

489
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:31,464
Oh, Lord.

490
00:43:32,733 --> 00:43:35,031
Am I wearing this 'cause
you think it might be contagious?

491
00:43:35,102 --> 00:43:37,036
I don't know if it is
or it isn't.

492
00:43:37,104 --> 00:43:39,868
I don't know a damn thing.
Neither does anyone else.

493
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:42,773
I've been going back and forth
with Narragansett Naval all day...

494
00:43:42,843 --> 00:43:44,777
consulting with the best people
in marine medicine...

495
00:43:44,845 --> 00:43:46,779
the best people in virology.

496
00:43:46,847 --> 00:43:49,213
They don't even believe
the symptoms I'm describing.

497
00:43:49,283 --> 00:43:51,877
Their best guess,
and that's all it is...

498
00:43:51,952 --> 00:43:54,352
is that before Sixpack died,
he was undergoing...

499
00:43:54,421 --> 00:43:56,355
some form of genetic alteration.

500
00:43:56,423 --> 00:43:58,584
Genetic alteration from what?

501
00:43:58,659 --> 00:44:00,593
It could be a million things.

502
00:44:00,661 --> 00:44:03,562
Something in the food, the air.

503
00:44:03,631 --> 00:44:07,362
Sixpack went in that ship,
and so did Williams.

504
00:44:08,836 --> 00:44:10,770
I want to examine
the rest of the crew.

505
00:44:10,838 --> 00:44:13,773
But I don't want to create a panic,
so until I get some answers...

506
00:44:13,841 --> 00:44:15,775
I don't think we should tell them
that Sixpack is dead.

507
00:44:20,548 --> 00:44:23,745
Skin condition? Herpes? Measles?
What is it?

508
00:44:23,818 --> 00:44:25,877
It's a little difficult
to describe.

509
00:44:25,953 --> 00:44:28,046
Christ, it would be
a hell of a thing...

510
00:44:28,122 --> 00:44:30,420
if I went back up to the roof
with a herpes thing.

511
00:44:30,491 --> 00:44:33,483
My wife would never
understand that at all.

512
00:44:34,795 --> 00:44:36,729
I don't think we have
to worry about that, do we?

513
00:44:36,797 --> 00:44:38,731
She wouldn't understand that at all.

514
00:44:38,799 --> 00:44:41,165
She'd think I was down here
screwing my head off or something.

515
00:44:41,235 --> 00:44:42,793
Put on your shirt.

516
00:44:43,904 --> 00:44:46,634
- It's all right?
- Yeah, you're fine.

517
00:44:49,844 --> 00:44:52,210
This whole thing is unnecessary, Doc.

518
00:44:52,279 --> 00:44:55,305
The only skin problem
I can see is white people.

519
00:44:58,152 --> 00:45:00,620
How come you're wearin' those gloves?

520
00:45:00,688 --> 00:45:02,986
It ain't bend-over time, is it?

521
00:45:03,057 --> 00:45:06,458
- Anything wrong?
- No, I just wanted to see something.

522
00:45:06,527 --> 00:45:08,757
That's all.

523
00:45:08,829 --> 00:45:12,697
You think it has anything to do
with going on that ship?

524
00:45:12,766 --> 00:45:14,859
Well, it's a possibility.
But if that was the case...

525
00:45:14,935 --> 00:45:17,130
you'd be showing some symptoms,
wouldn't you?

526
00:45:17,204 --> 00:45:20,332
- I'm okay?
- You're fine.

527
00:45:20,407 --> 00:45:22,341
No, really, you're fine.

528
00:45:22,409 --> 00:45:25,310
Great. Thanks, Doc.

529
00:45:25,379 --> 00:45:28,041
What do you mean, a skin problem?

530
00:45:28,115 --> 00:45:30,208
Your skin changes?

531
00:45:30,284 --> 00:45:34,345
- Yeah, it blackens. It gets scaly.
- What, like a fish?

532
00:45:38,993 --> 00:45:41,826
- Yeah, like a fish.
- I was just joking, Doc.

533
00:45:46,567 --> 00:45:49,035
You can finish
gettin' dressed out there.

534
00:45:52,039 --> 00:45:55,167
Oh, Bowman. I'm sorry.
I'll be right back.

535
00:46:03,284 --> 00:46:05,878
- Generic alteration?
- Genetic.

536
00:46:05,953 --> 00:46:09,389
Whatever. But you think it's
restricted to this one crew member?

537
00:46:09,456 --> 00:46:11,390
- Well, so far, but...
- But what?

538
00:46:11,458 --> 00:46:13,392
What if it turns out
to be nothing?

539
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:15,587
What are you talking about?
It's already killed one man!

540
00:46:15,663 --> 00:46:20,362
But you have no proof that
this disease is contagious, do you?

541
00:46:20,434 --> 00:46:22,925
And we've been wrong before,
haven't we, Dr. Thompson?

542
00:46:25,706 --> 00:46:28,368
Look, Martin, I think
you're missing the point here.

543
00:46:28,442 --> 00:46:30,910
My crew's in jeopardy.
I've seen this disease.

544
00:46:30,978 --> 00:46:32,912
And it's no day at the beach.

545
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:35,676
So by way of paragraph 539
of the manual...

546
00:46:35,749 --> 00:46:38,741
I'm ordering you to start
an emergency medical evacuation...

547
00:46:38,819 --> 00:46:40,753
of all the personnel
on the shack.

548
00:46:40,821 --> 00:46:42,914
It's your call,
but unfortunately...

549
00:46:42,990 --> 00:46:45,618
we can't pick you up so soon.

550
00:46:45,693 --> 00:46:48,992
There's a hurricane 600 miles
off the coast of Cuba...

551
00:46:49,063 --> 00:46:50,997
possibly coming your way.

552
00:46:51,065 --> 00:46:54,432
And if it does, the company does not
want to risk losing you folks.

553
00:46:54,501 --> 00:46:57,527
Are you saying you're not gonna
pick us up at the scheduled time?

554
00:46:57,604 --> 00:46:59,572
It shouldn't be a long delay.

555
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:02,074
Well, What's a long delay?
A day? A week? What?

556
00:47:02,142 --> 00:47:05,600
Twelve hours. We should know something
first thing in the morning.

557
00:47:05,679 --> 00:47:07,943
- I'll keep you posted.
- You better be there.

558
00:47:09,283 --> 00:47:11,114
- Twelve hours.
- Twelve hours.

559
00:47:11,185 --> 00:47:13,153
I promise.

560
00:47:27,668 --> 00:47:30,102
Bow, are you okay?

561
00:47:30,170 --> 00:47:32,229
Oh, my God. Come on.

562
00:47:34,308 --> 00:47:36,242
Can you help us here?

563
00:47:40,514 --> 00:47:43,347
- Let's put her here.
- Come on. Take it easy.

564
00:47:46,587 --> 00:47:48,521
It's all right.

565
00:47:51,191 --> 00:47:54,786
You're gonna be all right, okay?
I'm gonna go find Doc, all right?

566
00:47:54,862 --> 00:47:57,160
Hey, Doc?
Maybe he's with Sixpack.

567
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:03,461
Doc? Hey, you in here?

568
00:48:07,207 --> 00:48:09,539
Hey, man, how you doin'?

569
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:14,377
We made quota today, man, no thanks
to you, you dog, but we made it.

570
00:48:14,448 --> 00:48:17,315
You won't believe this, man,
but Beck helped us out.

571
00:48:17,384 --> 00:48:20,353
Yeah, we just brought Bowman in, man.

572
00:48:20,421 --> 00:48:22,355
She don't look too good.

573
00:48:22,423 --> 00:48:25,358
You know, I hope
what you got ain't catchin'.

574
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:29,124
Hey, look, I'm sorry, man.

575
00:48:29,196 --> 00:48:32,131
You go on back to sleep, okay?

576
00:48:32,199 --> 00:48:35,134
I'll talk to you later, all right?

577
00:48:42,576 --> 00:48:46,034
- I'm gonna go check the control room.
- Okay.

578
00:48:46,113 --> 00:48:49,139
- I'll be back in a minute, okay?
- Please don't go!

579
00:48:49,216 --> 00:48:52,674
Please don't leave me. I'm so sick.

580
00:48:52,753 --> 00:48:56,348
You're gonna be okay. Don't worry.

581
00:49:50,577 --> 00:49:52,511
My hair's coming out.

582
00:50:12,132 --> 00:50:14,123
Where'd you say? The infirmary?

583
00:50:21,041 --> 00:50:23,532
I don't understand.
I just left her here.

584
00:50:36,523 --> 00:50:37,990
It's Doc.

585
00:50:51,672 --> 00:50:53,105
Oh, man.

586
00:51:29,142 --> 00:51:33,511
Other than that, there's not much more
that I can tell you about it...

587
00:51:34,848 --> 00:51:38,306
except that none of you have
any of the symptoms.

588
00:51:38,385 --> 00:51:41,650
And this disease, it killed Bow?

589
00:51:44,091 --> 00:51:46,252
No, she killed herself.

590
00:51:48,862 --> 00:51:51,194
Hey, we're getting outta here
just in time.

591
00:51:51,265 --> 00:51:53,460
That's a whole 'nother problem.

592
00:51:53,533 --> 00:51:57,333
We're on hold for the pickup. There's
a hurricane rollin' into this sector.

593
00:51:57,404 --> 00:52:00,601
- A hurricane?
- Yeah. We're delayed 12 hours.

594
00:52:00,674 --> 00:52:04,701
Twelve hours? What're we gonna do?
We can't stay here for 12...

595
00:52:06,713 --> 00:52:10,274
- What was that?
- Wait a minute. Hold on. Just stay put.

596
00:52:10,350 --> 00:52:11,783
Okay.

597
00:52:31,471 --> 00:52:33,939
Oh, my God.

598
00:52:34,007 --> 00:52:35,941
What is this?

599
00:52:36,009 --> 00:52:37,909
What's goin' on?

600
00:53:06,673 --> 00:53:09,107
- Okay, get the door.
- Got it.

601
00:53:14,114 --> 00:53:17,481
The contract states that you can't
dispose of a body without authorization.

602
00:53:17,551 --> 00:53:20,315
Come on. Will you for once
forget about the contract?

603
00:53:20,387 --> 00:53:22,947
Section C of the Health and Safety Code.
Watch it.

604
00:53:25,859 --> 00:53:27,451
Program that lock.

605
00:53:28,929 --> 00:53:31,796
Hey, I feel something.

606
00:53:31,865 --> 00:53:33,833
What are you talkin' about?
They're dead.

607
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:36,130
Wait a minute. I feel something too.

608
00:53:36,203 --> 00:53:39,036
- Let's go.
- Somebody's alive in here.

609
00:53:39,106 --> 00:53:41,097
- Come on.
- Let's flush it.

610
00:53:41,174 --> 00:53:44,473
- "Flush it?" They're human beings!
- What if one's alive?

611
00:53:44,544 --> 00:53:46,569
- How about a moment of silence?
- Let's do it.

612
00:53:46,646 --> 00:53:49,672
- My God, they're alive!
- Let's have a look.

613
00:53:54,388 --> 00:53:56,913
- Don't stop!
- What the hell was that?

614
00:53:56,990 --> 00:53:58,582
Hit the button!

615
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,185
- Hit the lift button!
- Get outta there!

616
00:54:02,262 --> 00:54:04,423
Flush the damn thing! Flush it!

617
00:54:07,501 --> 00:54:09,935
Come on!

618
00:55:43,597 --> 00:55:45,030
Oh, God!

619
00:55:50,170 --> 00:55:54,573
It's coming up now. That camera's gonna
move into this room. That's it.

620
00:55:54,641 --> 00:55:58,577
Some kind of sick bay or lab
or something. Hold it. Run it back.

621
00:56:00,413 --> 00:56:03,075
That's it. Stop. Now move in.

622
00:56:04,584 --> 00:56:08,042
See? It looks like a human skull,
but I don't know.

623
00:56:08,121 --> 00:56:10,351
- There's something about it. It's...
- Bigger.

624
00:56:19,466 --> 00:56:24,301
Well, somebody's been screwing around.
Just take a look at that hand.

625
00:56:24,371 --> 00:56:27,534
- Look at the size of it.
- If you were tampering with genetics...

626
00:56:29,409 --> 00:56:32,037
why stop with the base model?

627
00:56:32,112 --> 00:56:35,309
Why not try to alter the human form?

628
00:56:35,382 --> 00:56:39,842
Homo aquaticus, a man who could live
underwater. Think of the possibilities.

629
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:41,854
Regeneration.

630
00:56:41,922 --> 00:56:45,414
The ability to withstand
extreme cold, pressure...

631
00:56:45,492 --> 00:56:48,518
Just think of it.
Undersea mining. Underwater farming.

632
00:56:48,595 --> 00:56:51,530
So What's next? I mean, what if
we run outta airplanes one day?

633
00:56:51,598 --> 00:56:55,295
What are we gonna do?
Just grow a whole bunch of bird people?

634
00:57:00,574 --> 00:57:03,805
Loosely translated:
"Don't fuck with Mother Nature."

635
00:57:22,762 --> 00:57:25,196
I better let the company know.

636
00:57:26,533 --> 00:57:28,797
Have you ever thought
that they may suspect already?

637
00:57:30,236 --> 00:57:32,204
Yeah. I thought about that.

638
00:57:32,272 --> 00:57:35,241
I think they got some kind
of commitment to their people.

639
00:57:35,308 --> 00:57:37,708
Save that speech for your ad campaign.

640
00:57:37,777 --> 00:57:40,837
This company's commitment is
to the almighty dollar.

641
00:57:40,914 --> 00:57:44,645
If you think, based on what
we've told them, that Tri-Oceanic...

642
00:57:44,718 --> 00:57:48,415
is gonna risk exposing themself
to potential market loss to save us...

643
00:57:48,488 --> 00:57:50,888
you're in for
an eye-opening experience.

644
00:57:50,957 --> 00:57:52,390
Maybe.

645
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:57,589
Maybe so. And I know your life's gone
a couple of bad rounds.

646
00:57:57,664 --> 00:58:01,896
But it doesn't necessarily mean
this whole company's one big bummer.

647
00:58:24,391 --> 00:58:26,825
I think we got something here.

648
00:58:29,529 --> 00:58:31,463
Son of a bitch.

649
00:58:35,602 --> 00:58:38,537
I don't get it.
Why did they put it in the vodka?

650
00:58:38,605 --> 00:58:43,065
Because it was an experiment, man.
They put the drug in the vodka!

651
00:58:43,143 --> 00:58:45,077
They meant to trick them
into takin' it.

652
00:58:45,145 --> 00:58:47,943
That way, see, they didn't know
what they were drinkin'.

653
00:58:48,014 --> 00:58:51,472
I mean, with us, they would have
put it in the coffee.

654
00:58:51,551 --> 00:58:53,883
- What are you talkin' about?
- Come on.

655
00:58:53,953 --> 00:58:57,912
You know how mothers put the castor oil
in with orange juice?

656
00:58:57,991 --> 00:59:00,983
They trick the baby into drinkin' it
so he don't know what he's drinkin.

657
00:59:01,061 --> 00:59:04,428
That's the kind of shit
they was doin', man!

658
00:59:04,497 --> 00:59:06,465
Fool. He coulïve got us all killed.

659
00:59:06,533 --> 00:59:10,560
You weren't holy when you were shooting
that vodka. It coulïve been anyone.

660
00:59:10,637 --> 00:59:13,765
Well, Miss High and Mighty,
it doesn't seem to bother you none.

661
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:15,831
Yeah, it bothers me.

662
00:59:15,909 --> 00:59:18,503
You deal with it your way.
I'll deal with it mine.

663
00:59:18,578 --> 00:59:23,015
You know that in Gstaad they have
64 square miles of ski slopes?

664
00:59:23,083 --> 00:59:25,745
Sixty-four square miles.

665
00:59:27,687 --> 00:59:31,680
How can you sit there goin', "Shh, shh,"
after what we just went through?

666
00:59:31,758 --> 00:59:35,057
And another thing. I'm gettin' tired
of hearin' about your goddamn skiin'.

667
00:59:35,128 --> 00:59:39,258
You don't know shit about skiin'.
They don't ski in Spanish Harlem.

668
00:59:39,332 --> 00:59:41,266
What about what we just saw?

669
00:59:41,334 --> 00:59:45,532
Like Willie said, you deal with it
your way, and I'll deal with it mine.

670
00:59:45,605 --> 00:59:49,871
- Doesn't anybody care what happened?
- What're you gonna do about it? Huh?

671
00:59:50,944 --> 00:59:53,913
Sixpack and Bow are dead.

672
00:59:57,884 --> 01:00:00,751
I can't help what happened. Can you?

673
01:00:02,922 --> 01:00:06,323
I'm gonna go get somethin' to eat.
Anybody want anything?

674
01:00:07,393 --> 01:00:10,590
Eat? After what we just went through?

675
01:00:29,849 --> 01:00:32,113
The storm's still holding its course.

676
01:00:32,185 --> 01:00:35,814
What about that disease?
Still just the one crew member?

677
01:00:35,889 --> 01:00:38,380
No change. Still just the one.

678
01:01:08,154 --> 01:01:10,384
Everybody's jumpy. What are you doin'?

679
01:01:10,456 --> 01:01:12,390
Lookin' for butter for the popcorn.

680
01:01:12,458 --> 01:01:17,088
Look, Hazy, you gonna make me finish
this puzzle by myself, or what?

681
01:01:17,163 --> 01:01:20,291
I should.
You know how long that took me?

682
01:01:20,366 --> 01:01:22,630
Hundreds, thousands, millions of hours.

683
01:01:26,105 --> 01:01:29,040
- I'll be right there.
- Okay. Hurry up.

684
01:02:13,186 --> 01:02:15,381
Holy shit!

685
01:02:16,556 --> 01:02:20,822
Please, God, help me!
Help me, Jonesy! Help me.

686
01:02:22,362 --> 01:02:25,331
I'm gonna go get some help.
I'll be right back, okay?

687
01:02:25,398 --> 01:02:27,764
Don't leave me.
Jonesy, don't leave me!

688
01:02:30,503 --> 01:02:32,528
- Please.
- I'll be back.

689
01:02:40,046 --> 01:02:42,241
Look! It's got Hazy!
Stay here and watch the door!

690
01:02:42,315 --> 01:02:45,250
Don't let him out!
I'm gonna go get the doc.

691
01:02:56,663 --> 01:02:58,597
I didn't want to tell her about Bowman.

692
01:02:58,665 --> 01:03:01,156
I listened to Martin, and my mind said,
"She's full of shit."

693
01:03:01,234 --> 01:03:03,168
It's got DeJesus! Come on!

694
01:03:33,499 --> 01:03:36,434
Don't go in there.
Don't touch anything!

695
01:03:37,603 --> 01:03:40,094
What the hell you doin'?
You supposed to be watchin' the door!

696
01:03:40,173 --> 01:03:42,232
I won't watch that thing
without protection.

697
01:03:42,308 --> 01:03:44,572
- That thing is my friend.
- Your friend is not human!

698
01:03:44,644 --> 01:03:47,135
Shut up, both of you! Jones!
Let's go find him.

699
01:03:47,213 --> 01:03:50,580
Okay? Come on. Let's go find him.
Wait a minute. Where's Willie?

700
01:03:52,218 --> 01:03:53,651
What's happening?

701
01:03:55,321 --> 01:03:57,448
My God, she's out there.

702
01:03:57,523 --> 01:03:59,457
All right. Jones, you come with me.

703
01:03:59,525 --> 01:04:02,961
Doc, you and Cobb check your office
and the dorm. Let's go.

704
01:04:43,469 --> 01:04:45,334
It's her scarf.

705
01:04:45,405 --> 01:04:48,568
Oh, sorry. What are you doing here?

706
01:04:48,641 --> 01:04:52,099
- What the hell you doin'?
- I've been trying to fix these lights.

707
01:04:52,178 --> 01:04:55,909
- What's going on?
- What got Sixpack and Bowman is here.

708
01:04:55,982 --> 01:04:58,678
- What?
- It just got DeJesus.

709
01:05:25,678 --> 01:05:28,340
All right. We're talkin' turkey.

710
01:05:35,221 --> 01:05:37,155
Oh, my God.

711
01:05:42,261 --> 01:05:44,195
The blood supply.

712
01:05:45,465 --> 01:05:47,865
Oh, my God.

713
01:05:47,934 --> 01:05:50,300
It got the blood supply.

714
01:06:41,754 --> 01:06:43,984
It's growing. It's had a meal.

715
01:06:44,056 --> 01:06:46,581
- It needs blood?
- Apparently.

716
01:06:46,659 --> 01:06:50,595
This is great. You're tellin' me we got
a goddamn Dracula in here with us?

717
01:06:50,663 --> 01:06:53,689
That's why that one on the ship
was dead. It needed blood.

718
01:06:53,766 --> 01:06:57,463
- What one on that ship?
- Tell the rank-and-file the secret.

719
01:06:57,537 --> 01:07:00,802
Whatever it is,
it appears to be a genetic aberration.

720
01:07:00,873 --> 01:07:04,536
- No shit.
- What're you trying to tell us?

721
01:07:04,610 --> 01:07:10,276
It has all the characteristics of
deep-sea marine life: Scales, gills...

722
01:07:12,351 --> 01:07:15,479
regeneration, even a period of dormancy.

723
01:07:15,555 --> 01:07:18,490
But the fact that it remembered
where that plasma was stored...

724
01:07:18,558 --> 01:07:22,289
seems to imply that is has
some other quality.

725
01:07:22,361 --> 01:07:25,387
- What?
- It absorbs its victim's intelligence.

726
01:07:25,464 --> 01:07:27,830
Intelligence may not be the right word.

727
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:32,234
The hell with semantics. Are you saying
it's part DeJesus, Sixpack and Bowman?

728
01:07:32,305 --> 01:07:36,537
I don't know. I'd just be guessing.

729
01:07:36,609 --> 01:07:41,569
But I do know the Russians deliberately
sank that ship to protect themselves.

730
01:07:44,317 --> 01:07:46,512
Maybe to protect us all.

731
01:07:46,586 --> 01:07:51,387
Then I say we protect ourselves. Let's
escape into the air bubbles and get out.

732
01:07:51,457 --> 01:07:54,824
And hit the surface in a hurricane?
The storm'd rip those bubbles to pieces.

733
01:07:54,894 --> 01:07:58,523
- They'd never find us.
- We wouldn't stand a chance.

734
01:08:01,734 --> 01:08:04,760
- What are we gonna do?
- I think we got one shot.

735
01:08:04,837 --> 01:08:09,274
Just one shot. We lure it to the swamp,
flush it out just like the other.

736
01:08:09,342 --> 01:08:11,367
How're we gonna do that?

737
01:08:18,851 --> 01:08:21,581
So we rendezvous in the mess
in 30 minutes.

738
01:08:21,654 --> 01:08:24,748
Mr. Cobb, synchronize 30 minutes.

739
01:08:24,824 --> 01:08:29,022
Mark. Got it?
Okay, so I'll run this by you again.

740
01:08:29,095 --> 01:08:32,360
If Jones and I aren't back here
in 30 minutes in the mess...

741
01:08:32,431 --> 01:08:35,366
hurricane or nothin', you get in those
escape bubbles and haul ass.

742
01:08:36,435 --> 01:08:39,063
- Let's do it.
- Be careful with this.

743
01:08:39,138 --> 01:08:41,766
- Don't worry. I don't want to give more.
- Take care.

744
01:08:41,841 --> 01:08:44,071
I'll do my best.

745
01:08:44,143 --> 01:08:46,077
Okay, let's go.

746
01:09:33,125 --> 01:09:35,525
You know, I was quite good once.

747
01:09:37,263 --> 01:09:40,198
When I did something,
it was important, you know?

748
01:09:43,903 --> 01:09:47,805
I developed drugs and techniques...

749
01:09:47,873 --> 01:09:50,808
that're used every day
by doctors all over the world.

750
01:09:53,245 --> 01:09:56,305
- Made a difference.
- It still does.

751
01:10:00,453 --> 01:10:02,387
This itches like hell.

752
01:10:07,193 --> 01:10:09,127
- I'm all right.
- Let me have a look.

753
01:10:09,195 --> 01:10:11,129
It really itches.

754
01:10:14,533 --> 01:10:16,467
That's because it's healing.

755
01:10:17,803 --> 01:10:20,101
I'm gonna change that dressing
to make you more comfortable.

756
01:10:20,172 --> 01:10:22,663
- Where are you going?
- The infirmary.

757
01:10:22,742 --> 01:10:24,232
Without protection?

758
01:10:24,310 --> 01:10:26,744
- You shouldn't go out there.
- She's right, you know.

759
01:12:22,094 --> 01:12:25,291
- You hear that?
- I hear it.

760
01:12:25,364 --> 01:12:27,298
Here we go.

761
01:12:54,126 --> 01:12:57,323
- Take off your shirt.
- Sure.

762
01:12:57,396 --> 01:12:59,796
I'm cold.

763
01:13:01,367 --> 01:13:03,494
Help me, please.

764
01:13:03,569 --> 01:13:06,003
Oh, yeah, sure.

765
01:13:15,948 --> 01:13:18,473
Help me!

766
01:13:18,551 --> 01:13:20,178
What's happening?

767
01:13:20,252 --> 01:13:22,049
Help!

768
01:13:45,311 --> 01:13:47,779
- Willie! Run!
- Run!

769
01:13:47,846 --> 01:13:49,780
Get over here!

770
01:14:09,735 --> 01:14:12,795
How are you doin'? All right?
Where's Doc and Cobb?

771
01:14:12,871 --> 01:14:15,032
- It got Doc.
- Wait a minute. It was just here.

772
01:14:15,107 --> 01:14:18,008
- I know.
- Wait a second. You saw it?

773
01:14:18,077 --> 01:14:22,207
- It was in Cobb. It was in him.
- Slow down. There's two of them?

774
01:14:23,315 --> 01:14:25,749
- Shit.
- All right.

775
01:14:25,818 --> 01:14:28,343
- How are you doin'?
- Okay.

776
01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:30,945
Okay, now what?

777
01:14:31,023 --> 01:14:34,288
How do you feel about big waves?

778
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:36,294
I love waves.

779
01:15:11,630 --> 01:15:14,565
We're trapped.
The escape bubbles are gone.

780
01:15:14,633 --> 01:15:16,624
- The door.
- Hey, look at this.

781
01:15:16,702 --> 01:15:18,693
"I am fully aware of the finality
of my decision.

782
01:15:18,771 --> 01:15:21,968
It is my hope that our sacrifice
will mean that the human race...

783
01:15:22,041 --> 01:15:24,032
will never know this awful mutation."

784
01:15:24,109 --> 01:15:28,068
- Our death warrant.
- Signed by the good doctor.

785
01:15:39,491 --> 01:15:41,288
Hell with it.

786
01:15:44,063 --> 01:15:47,692
- What are you doing?
- Well, I'm gonna find out...

787
01:15:47,766 --> 01:15:50,234
how far up Shit Creek we are.

788
01:16:00,312 --> 01:16:03,907
- Thank goodness you're still alive.
- Where you been?

789
01:16:03,982 --> 01:16:06,974
Get your ass out here now
and get us. Right now!

790
01:16:07,052 --> 01:16:10,146
Please calm down.
We haven't deserted you.

791
01:16:10,222 --> 01:16:13,521
Naturally, after we received Dr.
Thompson's message, we were concerned.

792
01:16:13,592 --> 01:16:15,753
But we never would have deserted you.

793
01:16:15,828 --> 01:16:17,659
When are you coming?

794
01:16:17,730 --> 01:16:20,756
- You said 12 hours.
- That's the bad news.

795
01:16:20,833 --> 01:16:24,633
The hurricane has turned your way.
Right now, it's on a course of...

796
01:16:24,703 --> 01:16:27,433
Just answer the goddamn question.
When are you coming?

797
01:16:27,506 --> 01:16:30,669
- Hopefully, within the next 48 hours.
- Forty-eight hours?

798
01:16:30,743 --> 01:16:33,109
I realize you must have gone
through hell...

799
01:16:33,178 --> 01:16:35,203
Gone? Bitch, we're still here!

800
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:38,215
I can't control the weather.
Rest assured, your SOS...

801
01:16:38,283 --> 01:16:41,081
was received by the coast guard
and the navy...

802
01:16:41,153 --> 01:16:44,850
and we will be responding
at the earliest, safest opportunity.

803
01:16:44,923 --> 01:16:50,156
- Just don't promise us nothin'.
- I realize this must sound ridiculous.

804
01:16:50,229 --> 01:16:53,289
- No shit.
- Now please try and get some rest.

805
01:16:53,365 --> 01:16:56,391
How are we gonna rest?
I can't sleep. Can you sleep?

806
01:16:56,468 --> 01:16:58,959
- Get some rest?
- Save your breath.

807
01:16:59,037 --> 01:17:02,939
- Damn. In 48 hours? No way.
- We don't have much choice, do we?

808
01:17:03,008 --> 01:17:06,444
I'll tell you what. I'll take a watch.
You all try to get some rest.

809
01:17:06,512 --> 01:17:10,380
I ain't gonna never be able
to sleep again. In life. Ever.

810
01:17:57,529 --> 01:18:00,225
"Request weather report, July 26."

811
01:18:00,299 --> 01:18:03,962
- "Data not available."
- Come on.

812
01:18:11,310 --> 01:18:12,743
"Files Closed."

813
01:18:12,811 --> 01:18:15,712
- Oh, man.
- They know, don't they?

814
01:18:15,781 --> 01:18:21,048
Yeah. I think they're just sittin'
up there, decidin' what to do with us.

815
01:18:21,119 --> 01:18:22,552
Maybe they have.

816
01:18:24,122 --> 01:18:27,956
- What're you looking for?
- I'm seeing how my investment's doing.

817
01:18:28,026 --> 01:18:30,824
"The stock of Tri-Oceanic Corp.
Took a bath today...

818
01:18:30,896 --> 01:18:33,865
when news of a tragic mining accident
was revealed to investors.

819
01:18:33,932 --> 01:18:37,800
The board of directors was called into
a meeting in New York this afternoon.

820
01:18:37,870 --> 01:18:41,237
A spokesperson revealed that
the accident destroyed Shack Seven...

821
01:18:41,306 --> 01:18:43,240
off the coast of Florida.

822
01:18:43,308 --> 01:18:45,242
Eight miners are reported dead.
All bodies are missing.

823
01:18:45,310 --> 01:18:48,575
Killed were Steven Beck,
Elizabeth Williams, Justin Jones...

824
01:18:48,647 --> 01:18:52,208
Dr. Glen Thompson, Tony Rodero, Bridget
Bowman, G.P. Cobb, Buzz Parrish."

825
01:18:52,284 --> 01:18:54,309
Martin, you bitch.

826
01:18:54,386 --> 01:18:56,445
Welcome to the union, boss.

827
01:18:56,521 --> 01:18:58,455
We're all expendable.

828
01:18:59,825 --> 01:19:02,385
- Doc, I owe you five dollars.
- Five dollars?

829
01:19:05,163 --> 01:19:07,688
- Emergency warning.
- Listen.

830
01:19:07,766 --> 01:19:10,360
- Countdown to implosion.
- The air's stopped.

831
01:19:10,435 --> 01:19:13,165
Ten minutes and counting.

832
01:19:13,238 --> 01:19:16,469
- They ripped open an air duct.
- Can we fix it?

833
01:19:16,541 --> 01:19:19,135
There are 20 miles of pipe.
They coulïve tapped in anywhere.

834
01:19:19,211 --> 01:19:20,644
That's true.

835
01:19:24,816 --> 01:19:27,114
Cobb. Job security.

836
01:19:27,185 --> 01:19:29,676
It's that rattle in Corridor A.

837
01:19:29,755 --> 01:19:33,122
You got it. It's showin' us where it is.

838
01:19:33,191 --> 01:19:36,285
- It's drawin' us out.
- It didn't waste any time, did it?

839
01:19:36,361 --> 01:19:39,125
You can't go out there.
That's what it wants.

840
01:19:39,197 --> 01:19:42,633
If we lose enough air in here, the
internal pressure will drop, and crunch.

841
01:19:42,701 --> 01:19:44,293
Implosion, babe.

842
01:19:44,369 --> 01:19:47,031
Wait. You don't think
I'm staying here?

843
01:19:47,973 --> 01:19:49,907
Nine minutes to implosion.

844
01:19:54,012 --> 01:19:56,776
- It's over here!
- Is that it?

845
01:19:56,848 --> 01:19:58,406
Yeah.

846
01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:03,654
- It's going!
- We're losin' air faster than I thought.

847
01:20:07,192 --> 01:20:09,490
- Go! Here.
- Don't spend all day down there.

848
01:20:09,561 --> 01:20:11,791
Don't worry. I won't.

849
01:20:11,863 --> 01:20:13,797
Let's do it.

850
01:20:25,077 --> 01:20:27,671
Eight minutes to implosion.

851
01:20:47,632 --> 01:20:50,692
- Oh, no. Damn!
- Can we fix it?

852
01:20:52,270 --> 01:20:55,762
- Can we shut it down someplace else?
- Come on.

853
01:20:55,841 --> 01:20:59,902
- What do you think? I wanna die?
- We're not gonna die. What do we do?

854
01:20:59,978 --> 01:21:01,912
- How should I know?
- You know this shack!

855
01:21:01,980 --> 01:21:04,847
- I don't know!
- Come on! This shack's your home, man!

856
01:21:04,916 --> 01:21:08,875
The swamp. There's a backup air valve
at the swamp. If we...

857
01:21:11,957 --> 01:21:14,721
- What?
- I just saw Doc.

858
01:21:14,793 --> 01:21:17,261
No, Jones. Let's get outta here.

859
01:21:17,329 --> 01:21:18,762
Come on.

860
01:21:23,869 --> 01:21:25,769
Seven minutes to implosion.

861
01:21:28,607 --> 01:21:30,632
- Look out!
- Watch out!

862
01:21:38,583 --> 01:21:40,676
- Did you get it?
- I think we did it!

863
01:21:40,752 --> 01:21:42,845
- I don't know!
- Hurry!

864
01:21:42,921 --> 01:21:46,049
Move it! The door's closing!

865
01:21:54,599 --> 01:21:58,000
The other door's closing!

866
01:21:59,771 --> 01:22:03,104
Willie, get out! Get out!

867
01:22:03,175 --> 01:22:04,802
- Torch it!
- Careful!

868
01:22:04,876 --> 01:22:06,343
It's jammed!

869
01:22:15,854 --> 01:22:18,789
Check that door!
Willie, get outta here!

870
01:22:18,857 --> 01:22:21,189
- The door's closing!
- Get that door!

871
01:22:22,794 --> 01:22:26,890
- Go! Go! Go!
- Six minutes to implosion.

872
01:22:26,965 --> 01:22:28,660
Come on!

873
01:23:01,900 --> 01:23:05,097
Grab my hand!

874
01:23:07,305 --> 01:23:10,433
Grab it! Come on!

875
01:23:12,010 --> 01:23:14,410
Go! Come on!

876
01:23:14,479 --> 01:23:17,243
You got it.

877
01:23:24,589 --> 01:23:26,454
Come on!

878
01:23:31,363 --> 01:23:33,797
Let me help him! Let me go!

879
01:23:33,865 --> 01:23:35,662
The handsaw on the table!

880
01:23:44,109 --> 01:23:46,134
- Help him!
- Stay back!

881
01:23:59,591 --> 01:24:01,616
Four minutes to implosion.

882
01:24:11,870 --> 01:24:13,804
There's no air.

883
01:24:18,210 --> 01:24:20,508
The door's jammed!

884
01:24:24,716 --> 01:24:28,777
The air valve! It's too hot!
I can't get to it!

885
01:24:28,853 --> 01:24:31,447
- Forget it! Get the suits!
- The suits? You crazy?

886
01:24:31,523 --> 01:24:34,287
Bring the lift bags!

887
01:24:35,393 --> 01:24:38,294
- How're we gonna get to the surface?
- Like this.

888
01:24:38,363 --> 01:24:42,732
We'll triple the inflation ratio. We'll
float to the top like a balloon. Go!

889
01:24:45,537 --> 01:24:48,870
Okay, let's hook 'em up.
Get in the suits.

890
01:24:48,940 --> 01:24:51,101
- What about yours?
- Get in the suit.

891
01:24:52,544 --> 01:24:55,775
Three minutes to implosion.

892
01:25:12,931 --> 01:25:14,728
Come on!

893
01:25:22,707 --> 01:25:24,607
Let's go!

894
01:25:24,676 --> 01:25:26,109
See you topside.

895
01:25:27,279 --> 01:25:29,406
Get into your suit!

896
01:25:29,481 --> 01:25:32,507
Beck, get into the suit!

897
01:25:35,720 --> 01:25:38,245
Don't be a fool!

898
01:25:44,696 --> 01:25:46,823
Two minutes to implosion.

899
01:25:51,336 --> 01:25:52,769
Kill me.

900
01:25:52,837 --> 01:25:55,397
My God. DeJesus.

901
01:26:27,038 --> 01:26:28,471
Shit!

902
01:26:48,860 --> 01:26:51,727
Oh, shit!

903
01:26:55,033 --> 01:26:57,297
One minute to implosion.

904
01:29:46,237 --> 01:29:48,171
You made it!

905
01:29:53,411 --> 01:29:56,209
Base to Coast Guard
Rescue Chopper 1437.

906
01:29:56,281 --> 01:29:59,079
Make one more attempt in search area
and return to base.

907
01:30:11,129 --> 01:30:15,088
- So where's the goddamn hurricane?
- You all right?

908
01:30:15,166 --> 01:30:17,100
- I made it.
- Yeah?

909
01:30:17,168 --> 01:30:21,468
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm all right.
I'll be all right. Okay.

910
01:30:25,176 --> 01:30:29,237
Base to Rescue Chopper 1437.
Any visual contact?

911
01:30:29,314 --> 01:30:31,248
- Negative.
- Return to base.

912
01:30:44,028 --> 01:30:45,461
It's cold.

913
01:30:48,466 --> 01:30:50,161
- Hey!
- Here!

914
01:30:50,234 --> 01:30:52,031
- Over here!
- Give me that last flare.

915
01:30:55,106 --> 01:30:56,971
There's a flare straight ahead.

916
01:30:57,041 --> 01:31:00,670
- Jones! Look!
- Chopper.

917
01:31:04,415 --> 01:31:06,406
- Sharks!
- Where are they?

918
01:31:06,484 --> 01:31:08,042
- Too close!
- Stay close.

919
01:31:11,956 --> 01:31:14,857
Stay close!

920
01:31:18,863 --> 01:31:21,661
Talk about having a bad day.

921
01:31:32,410 --> 01:31:34,310
- Help!
- Yes! Come on!

922
01:31:41,753 --> 01:31:43,914
- Jesus!
- Willie!

923
01:31:43,988 --> 01:31:46,149
- Get those people up!
- Go!

924
01:31:47,558 --> 01:31:49,958
- Grab a hand!
- Get outta here!

925
01:32:02,006 --> 01:32:04,531
It's got Jones!

926
01:32:04,609 --> 01:32:06,133
Come back!

927
01:32:06,210 --> 01:32:08,405
Don't! Save yourself!

928
01:32:17,789 --> 01:32:20,121
Come back!

929
01:32:24,929 --> 01:32:26,658
Say "Aah," motherfucker!

930
01:32:30,902 --> 01:32:32,995
Let's get outta here!

931
01:32:51,389 --> 01:32:54,187
Helicopter 405 heading back
to platform P.O.C.

932
01:33:59,390 --> 01:34:02,951
They don't want anything else
to do with it, you know?

933
01:34:05,963 --> 01:34:07,794
You made it!

934
01:34:08,900 --> 01:34:11,892
No one back at Tri-Oceanic
believed me.

935
01:34:11,969 --> 01:34:16,338
But I never gave up on you once.
How do you feel?

936
01:34:17,475 --> 01:34:19,909
Better. A lot better.

937
01:34:20,909 --> 01:34:30,909
