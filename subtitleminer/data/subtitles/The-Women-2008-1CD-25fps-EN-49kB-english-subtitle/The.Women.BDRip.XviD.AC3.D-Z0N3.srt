1
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,800
Get that thing away.
Has that ugly mutt had its shots?

2
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,160
Go for the shoes, bad shoes.
Last season's markdowns.

3
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,600
Oh, I never.

4
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,640
It's okay, sweetie.

5
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,600
There's a word for a woman like that.

6
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,960
And it's rarely used outside a kennel.

7
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,160
Okay, puppy, five minutes
to shop the first floor. Go.

8
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,400
- Here?
That's right.

9
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,440
Do you know about that list?

10
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,320
No.
- It's like that, but you know, I...

11
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,080
Oh, I need some blush.

12
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,080
Girl, I gotta be...

13
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,160
Complimentary sampler
of our new cream with any $25 purchase.

14
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,480
How about you?

15
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,560
Would you like to get a facelift in a jar?

16
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,560
This is my face, deal with it.

17
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,720
Hey, Sylvie.

18
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:40,160
I'm looking at a woman right now
who should be in my magazine.

19
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,480
"There's a fine line
between an outfit and a getup. "

20
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,800
Heh, heh. Where are you right now?
You're not shopping, are you?

21
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,000
Of course, I deserve it.

22
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,040
I was in my office at 6 this morning.

23
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,160
I love Saturdays at the office,
no one there to distract me.

24
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,880
Hey, shouldn't you be
on your way here right now?

25
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,840
What time is it, anyway?

26
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,520
Mary, what are you doing?

27
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,720
Are you having sex?

28
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,240
Would I be on the phone with you?

29
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,160
Don't answer that.

30
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,320
I'm on my way upstairs for a manicure.

31
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,000
What time is your little do today?

32
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,760
Oh, for the third time, 12:30, okay?

33
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,920
And do not be late, Sylvie,
I need you here.

34
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,120
Please, when am I ever late?

35
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,440
- Ha.
- I'll see you 12:30-ish?

36
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,440
No, no, no "ish. "

37
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,600
No "ish. "

38
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,160
Hi, welcome to Saks.
Would you like to try?

39
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,760
- Hello, Ms. Fowler, how have you been?
- Aretha needs water.

40
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,240
Sparkling or still?

41
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,280
Whatever. She drinks out of the toilet.

42
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,960
Tanya's ready for you, Ms. Fowler.

43
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,840
Are you Tanya?
- Yeah, that's me. Have a seat.

44
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,840
That's your name?
Or are you really Susie from Brooklyn?

45
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,360
If it's a long story, don't tell me,
I'm in a hurry.

46
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,560
I was born Eileen,
if you wanna know the truth.

47
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,480
I went to this numerologist who said...

48
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,720
...to change my life,
I should change my name.

49
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,880
I was working at Mr. Ronnie's
on Astoria Boulevard. Do you know it?

50
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,440
I don't get out to Queens
as much as I'd like.

51
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,680
The day I changed my name,
a limousine pulls up in front of the shop.

52
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,400
You're never gonna believe
who gets out. Madonna.

53
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,360
- I have to be at a luncheon at 1.
- Anyway, I can't believe it.

54
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,320
I look at her nails, thinking,
"What kind of butcher did this?"

55
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,240
So I gave her a manicure
like she's never had in this life.

56
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,400
Switch.

57
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,760
I use my own polish.

58
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,520
I mix my own colors. I have a gift.

59
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,240
The luncheon's in Connecticut.
That's a whole other state.

60
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,560
I put Jungle Red on her.
I'll never forget it.

61
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,040
Next thing, Saks is calling me saying
Madonna's raving about my manicure...

62
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,240
...and do I want a job.

63
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,320
- So you wanna try my Jungle Red?
- Hmm. Not bad.

64
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,320
I put this on one of the girls
behind the perfume counter.

65
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,720
She just moved to town, bang,
she's having an affair with a married man.

66
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,800
Who isn't? If you can't speed this up,
I'm gonna have to come back.

67
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,200
- What's your Wednesday like?
- Oh, I'll check.

68
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,880
The married-man thing is tricky, isn't it?
Especially when the guy's well-known.

69
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,760
He's some big hoo-hah on Wall Street.

70
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,960
I can never remember that guy's name.
Everybody knows him.

71
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,880
Wednesday, Wednesday... Haines.

72
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,080
That's it, something Haines.

73
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,640
It wouldn't, by any chance,
be Stephen Haines, would it?

74
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,360
Uh, yeah, that's it.

75
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,200
Wednesday, 11 or 2?

76
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,800
You know, Wednesday isn't good.

77
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,960
I think I'd better get this
taken care of now.

78
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,440
Oh, great, okay.

79
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:17,080
So you're telling me that Stephen Haines
is having an affair with a salesgirl?

80
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,240
What do you think that's all about?

81
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,280
If you ever saw Crystal Allen,
you wouldn't have to ask.

82
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:33,600
Yes, buzz, buzz, I hear you.

83
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,800
I swear to God,
it scares me to come here.

84
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,200
I'll be a few minutes.

85
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,200
I parked on 78th Street
in front of a vacuum-cleaner store.

86
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,320
Don't let me forget.

87
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,440
- Why would you forget?
- I just heard something, Edie.

88
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,600
It was very disturbing.

89
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,360
I don't know, I almost rear-ended
somebody on the way here.

90
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,680
April, give Mommy her hat.

91
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,520
May, teach June how to braid
her hair like Mommy taught you.

92
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,840
And, hello,
don't we say hi to Aunt Sylvie?

93
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,560
- Hi, kids.
No way.

94
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,440
I don't want to.

95
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,600
- They love you, they love you.
She scares me.

96
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,240
Dora, I'm getting ready to leave.

97
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,400
I have a splitting headache.
You have aspirin?

98
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,640
Sylvie, what did you hear?
Where is my purse?

99
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,800
Come here, June.

100
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,720
- Wait, what's that supposed to be?
- Oh, I'm painting now.

101
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,120
Painting?
Wait, what about the pottery thing?

102
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,160
Weren't you taking
some puppet-making class?

103
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,520
Let me tell you something.

104
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,560
Weird crowd of people,
the puppet people.

105
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,240
I'd go insane living here.
I don't know how Alan does it.

106
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,480
Oh, Alan moved out.

107
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,320
Whoa, what?

108
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,480
Oh, it's okay.

109
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,720
He's down in a studio
on the eighth floor.

110
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,560
I thought he could use a little space.

111
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,040
- Dora!
- Let's just go, I can't focus.

112
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,480
Dora?
- Will you drive?

113
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:43,320
Sylvie, whatever you heard,
if it's about anybody we know...

114
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,760
...don't tell me, I mean it.

115
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,960
Of course I won't tell you.
It's too personal.

116
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,760
It's about someone we know, isn't it?

117
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,840
Mrs. Edie,
we're running low on breast milk.

118
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,600
Oh, I have the pump in my bag.

119
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,800
It plugs into the cigarette lighter
in the car.

120
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,600
Well, forget it, you're not driving.

121
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,680
How are you today, little Miss January?
How are you?

122
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,800
Forget it, let's go.

123
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,600
Lucy, Lucy, Lucy, sit, stay, lay down.

124
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,640
Hey, Maggie, did you remember
to polish the silver for the, uh...?

125
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,080
- Lunch?
- Yes, lunch.

126
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,680
- Yeah, yes, ma'am.
Oh, boy.

127
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,080
How did it get to be noon?

128
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,360
I have 60 women
on their way here for lunch.

129
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,960
I haven't even showered.

130
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,320
Did you remember
to pick up my dry-cleaning?

131
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,080
Yes, I remembered
to pick up your dry-cleaning.

132
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,640
What is wrong with this picture?

133
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,840
How lovely. Thank you.

134
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,360
Okay, dog, clean.

135
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:50,200
Bread, flowers and... Oh.

136
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:54,040
Hey, um, do you know where the thing that
I made with the whatsits around the edge?

137
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,200
- Bowl with the freesias.
- Yeah, where is that?

138
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,520
Right in front of you.

139
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,320
Oh, yeah, I think the tortellini
will fit in that.

140
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,400
- What do you think, Uta?
- Oh, look at this.

141
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,600
The face of the Virgin Mary appeared
on a rag at a car wash in Los Angeles.

142
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,480
It's hard to believe that you were born
in a country that hands out the Nobel Prize.

143
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,120
That's Sweden.
How many times do I have to tell you?

144
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,520
I'm Danish.

145
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,920
Like the pastry.

146
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,120
- Mom, what's going on?
- Hey, honey.

147
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,440
You're supposed to help me
with my book report.

148
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,240
Oh, my God, I just completely forgot.

149
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,320
- I'm so sorry.
- It's due Monday.

150
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,080
Yes, but today is the luncheon for the park.
I'm co-chair.

151
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,200
Which is more important?
Some piece of grass or my education?

152
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,920
Molly, I don't know why you save
these things till the last minute, honestly.

153
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,600
- Uta can help you with your book report.
- That's her job.

154
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,240
Nicole Kidman has cellulite.

155
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,480
Where? Let me see.

156
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,280
- Oh.
I think they drew that in.

157
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,720
Let's do it...
We'll finish it after the lunch.

158
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,080
- No, we can't, I have to finish the...
- Sketches.

159
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,560
Sketches which are late.

160
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,600
- Then I've to pick up...
- Airline tickets.

161
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,280
Why do you always save these things
for the last minute?

162
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,360
Molly Jane Haines,
is that any way to talk to your mother?

163
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,920
Chocolate macadamia cookies.

164
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,800
No, that's like five points.

165
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,680
- Since when are you counting calories?
- Since I'm fat.

166
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,800
Since you're fat?

167
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,640
Oh, honey, you're not fat, you're perfect.

168
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,520
I'll just do the book report myself.

169
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,160
- Now, go take a shower.
- Oh, yeah.

170
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,760
She thinks she's fat.

171
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,560
Oh, your father called.

172
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,320
He wants you to have lunch with him
when you come back from your vacation.

173
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,040
My father wants to have lunch with me?
Don't remember the last time he wanted to.

174
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,080
He said it was important.

175
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,280
Oh, Maggie, I think I know
what this is about.

176
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,000
I think he's getting ready
to hand me the business.

177
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,000
- Know how long I've been waiting?
- Years, you've been waiting.

178
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,280
- Just years.
- Years.

179
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,720
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

180
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46,040
Oh. Lucy, Lucy, Lucy, off, off, off.

181
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,120
Molly, how many times have I told you,
no dogs on the bed?

182
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,960
Lucy, off. Go on.

183
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,000
- Hey, Mom?
- Yeah.

184
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,720
How come you design clothes
you wouldn't be caught dead in?

185
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,720
That's what your grandfather
manufactures.

186
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,160
Those are his customers,
but they're not gonna be mine.

187
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,400
What's this?

188
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,600
That is a travel coffee filter.

189
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,720
Here they come.
The population of Salem has just dropped.

190
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,000
All right, all right,
keep your Wonderbras on.

191
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,560
It's just a mess now.
Who knows if it's gonna come out?

192
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,080
- It's a brand-new Lexus.
- It's gonna come out, it's from nature.

193
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,560
Just calm down.

194
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,880
She splattered breast milk
all over the dashboard.

195
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,240
- Do you have a rag?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, here.

196
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,920
Maggie, Maggie, can you please put this
in the refrigerator for me?

197
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,040
I'll put it right next to the 2-percent.

198
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,360
Okay, thank you.

199
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,840
Oh, my God.

200
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,760
I can't believe you're here.

201
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,120
You know what? I don't know
that I've ever seen you in the daylight.

202
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,240
You haven't.

203
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,720
Hello, I'm Edie Cohen.

204
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,160
Natasha.

205
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,080
- Natasha?
- Just Natasha.

206
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,640
Oh.

207
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:06,040
Well, very nice to meet you,
just Natasha.

208
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,120
Natasha's a supermodel.

209
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,520
I hate that word. Do not call me that.

210
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,000
It objectifies me.

211
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,920
I'm a person, not an accessory.

212
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,680
Okay, fine. You're not a purse.

213
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,960
I'm gonna go and get something to drink.
Don't talk about me.

214
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,440
She just finished anger management.

215
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,640
Well, what does she have
to be angry about?

216
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,600
- She's hungry.
- Oh.

217
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,360
When are you just gonna settle down
with someone who's right for you?

218
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,120
Like a man? Please.

219
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,560
You know that I accept you
as my gay friend.

220
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,880
Thank you.

221
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,840
But all of a sudden, half the world is gay.
Explain that.

222
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,360
You just don't understand
how much better it is...

223
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,320
...being in a relationship with a woman.

224
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,360
If we're lost, we both ask for directions.

225
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,520
When we watch TV,
we watch one show at a time.

226
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,920
Nobody drinks out of the milk carton
or asks you to pull their finger...

227
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,280
...or obsesses over their decreasing ability
to piss 30 feet.

228
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,920
- And when we have sex...
- Oh, no, my...

229
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,440
- neither one of us wants it
with the lights on.

230
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,720
Are you jealous yet?

231
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,560
Hey, you owe me a hundred bucks
to have my car detailed, okay?

232
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,680
And tell me, Dorothy Parker...

233
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,920
...how much longer am I gonna have to wait
for your second book, huh?

234
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,080
I'd like to print an excerpt
before I'm dead.

235
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,440
You see, you don't just dash off a book
full of sharply observed, hilarious...

236
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,960
<i>...yet deeply intelligent essays,
to quote The New York Times.</i>

237
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,600
Yeah, that was six years ago.
Let's get on with it, huh?

238
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,600
She's a little distracted.
Did you see her date?

239
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,480
Hm.

240
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,880
So is Mary in here?

241
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:39,520
It's just so generous of you to open
your gorgeous home for Central Park.

242
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,440
Your mother was chair
of the women's committee for many years.

243
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,520
Yes, and it's very important to her
that I carry on the tradition.

244
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,640
- And me, of course.
- Well, of course.

245
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,000
I don't know
how you manage things in your life...

246
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,040
...and still make time
for your charitable work.

247
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,120
- Oh, well, pharmaceuticals.
- Oh, heh, heh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

248
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,280
There's a champagne buffet
out on the lawn.

249
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,720
Barbara, please help yourself.

250
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,120
- Oh, amazing, you're here on time.
- Hey, what do you mean?

251
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,280
I'm always on time.
You're the one who's late.

252
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,760
Will you put that thing away?

253
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,560
So impressive turnout. Congrats.

254
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:15,400
- Well, thanks for opening up your Rolodex.
- Hey, what are best friends for?

255
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,840
- What's wrong? Nothing.
- What's wrong? Nothing.

256
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
- Why are you asking?
- You looked at me funny.

257
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,280
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

258
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,280
Yeah, something. Your eyes just shifted.

259
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,960
- You're not telling me something.
- I tell you everything.

260
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,680
And what's with you,
and your tense shoulders up to your ears?

261
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,120
Oh. Okay, I wasn't gonna say anything...

262
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,920
...but I think my father's getting ready
to hand me the, uh...

263
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,200
- Business?
- Yes.

264
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,720
- Wow. Is that a good thing?
- Of course, yes, it's a great thing.

265
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,160
It's a fantastic thing,
it's just a lot to take on.

266
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,680
I have to talk to Stephen.
He's not gonna be thrilled.

267
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,680
Stephen, right.
So where is he on a Saturday afternoon?

268
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,440
The office, where he has been
almost every day and night...

269
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,000
...for the last month,
working on some hedge fund.

270
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,600
Hmm.

271
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,920
- Really? Ahem.
- Yeah, but in 24 hours...

272
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,080
...we are gonna be sipping cappuccino
at the Piazza San Marco.

273
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,200
- Are you sure you're all right?
- I'm fine. I'm just kind of hungry.

274
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,200
I'll get something to eat.

275
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,040
- Oh. Oh.
- Oh.

276
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,560
- No, that's okay.
- Lucy.

277
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,720
- Take this.
- Oh, no.

278
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,880
You have to.
You can come work for me.

279
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,080
- Oh, my.
- Take the card.

280
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,480
- No, I won't do it.
- Please take the card, sweetheart. Take it.

281
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,240
No carbohydrates at all, which is fine...

282
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,080
...because the human body
does not need them.

283
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,360
- Hey, cute dress.
Thanks.

284
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,000
Cool shades.

285
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,960
- There you go.
- Thanks.

286
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,840
Cheers.

287
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,680
Edie, that's a lot of food.
Where are you putting it?

288
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,840
Well, I might as well tell you.

289
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,360
You'll find out soon enough.

290
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,440
I'm eating for two.

291
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,720
- Aw. For crying out loud, Edie, jeez.
- Oh, my God.

292
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,120
- Don't you ever say no?
- How many kids do you need?

293
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,040
- What's happening?
- Edie's knocked up again.

294
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,760
Oof. Ugh.

295
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,480
- Are you sure?
- Of course I'm sure.

296
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,760
- I wanna keep going until I get a boy.
- Don't we have enough of those?

297
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,680
You know what?
You two don't understand.

298
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,040
There's absolutely nothing
more thrilling...

299
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,520
...than knowing that you're actually
growing a human being inside of you.

300
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,720
Right, Mary?

301
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,640
Well, you know,
I was going through some junk...

302
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,400
...in the attic the other day,
and I saw this box labeled "jars. "

303
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,160
Yes, I am a jar saver.

304
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:42,200
And I open up the box, anyway,
and I look in there, and it's not jars.

305
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,080
It's just a whole pile
of Molly's baby clothes.

306
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:49,320
I just picked up one of those little rompers,
I could just feel the tug on my uterus, so...

307
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,280
What are you saying?
You're thinking about having another baby?

308
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:56,520
I don't know, you know. I'd never thought
about having more than one, but lately...

309
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,640
Maybe since I know the gate's closing,
I don't know.

310
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,120
- What?
- Nothing.

311
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,280
Something.

312
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,000
I've gotta pee.

313
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,720
For the 10th time today.

314
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,560
I'll be right back.

315
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,600
- Edie.
- What, uh, are you doing?

316
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,840
I wasn't gonna say anything,
but now I have to.

317
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Mary is like my sister.

318
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,920
I told you, Sylvie, I don't wanna know.

319
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,080
Oh, it's about Mary?

320
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,920
- This is in the vault, right?
- Vault.

321
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:28,400
- Stephen is having an affair.
- Oh, my God. How do you know?

322
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,440
The new manicurist at Saks told me.

323
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,000
He's fooling around with some woman
who works behind the perfume counter.

324
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,240
- The spritzer girl?
- Yeah, can you believe that?

325
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,240
What do you think she sells?
Chanel No. Shit?

326
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,360
So, what are you saying?
You wanna tell Mary?

327
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,120
Of course not, but she's talking
about having another baby.

328
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,800
Oh, this is very dangerous, Sylvie.

329
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,880
What if the story isn't true?
How much can you trust a manicurist?

330
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,480
Oh, they know everything.
Manicurists and florists.

331
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,480
It's frightening how much information
those people are carrying.

332
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,680
I don't think we should say anything.
It could come back to haunt us.

333
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,040
- The affair could be over for all we know.
- True.

334
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,720
Besides, I don't know anyone
who's gotten into trouble...

335
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,000
...for keeping their mouth shut.

336
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,040
I mean, I know things about my friends.

337
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,440
And I mean, things.

338
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,320
Me too.

339
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,960
- Cheap hand towels.
- Let's go.

340
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,480
Right.

341
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,560
Oh. I forgot to pee.

342
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,160
Hey!
- Oh, no.

343
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,240
- Thank you so much.
- Oh, everything was wonderful, Mary.

344
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,640
I must have the name of your caterer,
so yummy.

345
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:35,120
Oh. No, I made everything myself. I think
people appreciate the personal touch.

346
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,320
You cooked?

347
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,600
Oh, Mary, how could you?
What were you thinking?

348
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,160
Now we'll all have to do that.

349
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,800
And not all of us are you.

350
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,720
Anyway, congratulations
on a successful event.

351
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,320
Phone for you. It's him.

352
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,520
Bye.
Bye.

353
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,640
Hey, honey, they're almost gone.

354
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,320
It's safe to come home.

355
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,680
Since we're leaving
in the morning tomorrow...

356
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,000
...let's just eat out, and...

357
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,320
Stephen?

358
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,240
Ste...

359
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,160
Stephen,
it took forever to plan this trip...

360
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,120
...and we both really need a vacation.

361
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,920
Yeah, no, there has to be some way.

362
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,880
All right.

363
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,880
Okay, I'll call the travel agent.

364
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,200
I guess, uh, Venice will still be there.

365
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,320
When are you coming home?

366
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,240
Oh, okay, then I won't wait up.

367
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,760
All right, bye.

368
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,840
That goddamn office
is sucking the life out of him.

369
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
- Well, something definitely is.
- Sylvie.

370
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,720
Come on.
- We didn't mean to be listening in.

371
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,000
No, no, it's okay.
Thank you so much for coming.

372
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,200
It meant a lot to me.

373
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:59,280
Are you gonna be okay?
I would stay, but we carpooled.

374
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,840
I'm so sorry,
I've got the little ones at home.

375
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,920
No, no, I'm fine. I'm gonna be fine.

376
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,840
Okay.

377
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,720
Goddamn it.

378
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,280
Ned, you gotta back me on this.

379
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,880
It's time to stop talking down
to our readers.

380
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,200
<i>That's the way CACHET
is gonna distinguish itself.</i>

381
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,520
You talk about branding the magazine.

382
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:28,680
How about we become
the thinking woman's fashion book?

383
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,880
Bring on the provocative writers.

384
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,400
We stop putting little Hollywood twits
on the cover.

385
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:38,200
Yes, I know the twits sell,
but, Ned, you hired me for a reason.

386
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,680
Let me do my job.

387
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,640
This time next year,
you'll look like a genius.

388
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:46,240
- Mary's on three.
- Uh, Ned, I got Ralph Lauren on the line.

389
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,080
I gotta go.

390
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,760
So how was lunch with Dad?

391
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,000
How does it feel to be head
of your own design house?

392
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,120
<i>- He fired me.
What?</i>

393
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,400
Yeah, my own father.

394
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:02,640
He said I was spreading myself too thin
and that it showed in my work.

395
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,080
Excuse me, but designing
the perfect little frock...

396
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,000
...for a woman to wear home
from hip-replacement surgery...

397
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,680
...is not exactly my work.

398
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,560
Oh, honey.

399
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,160
Come to my office,
the Grey Goose rep was just here.

400
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,360
We'll open a bottle and bitch about the men
who don't believe in us.

401
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,960
What? Is Ned riding you again?

402
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,000
Oh, I mean, that's just absolutely absurd.

403
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,880
That must feel terrible.

404
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,800
- Why doesn't he just trust your vision?
- Well, it's a crisis of confidence.

405
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,960
I can feel it.

406
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,600
I need to pull a couple of great writers
onto this magazine, and fast.

407
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,800
<i>Well, you can do that. Stop at nothing.</i>

408
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,960
I love you, you know that?

409
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,120
Whoa. Well, you wouldn't if you saw me.
My hair looks terrible.

410
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:42,040
Could you get me into Saks for a haircut?
Is that okay?

411
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,240
Don't go to Saks. They'll butcher you.

412
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,680
Hey! Hey!

413
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:50,400
Wait, what are you talking about?
That woman just did the rudest thing.

414
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,880
Your hair always looks great.

415
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,560
<i>- Anyway, love you, mean it, bye.
- Mary.</i>

416
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,240
Mary?

417
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,920
Women.

418
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,400
Hello, I'm Mary Haines, and my friend
Sylvie Fowler called ahead for me.

419
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:13,080
Yes, she did.
We can squeeze you in, but not for an hour.

420
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,080
- I'm really sorry.
- Oh.

421
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,480
Oh.

422
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,600
Well, can I get a manicure while I wait?

423
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,920
- Let me check.
- Okay.

424
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,600
Let's see.

425
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,480
- Okay, Tanya's had a cancellation.
- Great.

426
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,000
- First table, straight back.
- Okay, thank you.

427
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,200
Oh.

428
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,400
Okay. Tanya?

429
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,560
Tanya?

430
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,320
- Hi, they told me to come right back here.
- Oh, sure, have a seat.

431
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,360
Well, let's have a look.

432
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,400
Oh, my, what have we done
to ourselves?

433
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,880
Oh, I retiled my bathroom.

434
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,080
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

435
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,680
Oh, God.

436
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,080
Oh, I was thinking
about something neutral.

437
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,040
Wanna maybe take a walk
on the wild side?

438
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,480
- How about this? Jungle Red.
- That's a little too much for me.

439
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,120
How about this? This is nice.

440
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,600
French Fawn, whatever. Okay.

441
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,360
What's that perfume you're wearing?

442
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,880
- Something my husband gave me.
- Oh, where have I smelled that before?

443
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,280
I know. That's the same stuff
that my friend wears.

444
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,360
She works the perfume counter
downstairs.

445
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,480
Expensive stuff.

446
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,520
But she's got expensive taste, that one.

447
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,240
- Her name's Crystal Allen.
- Who?

448
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,360
My friend at the perfume counter.
That girl needs a man with money.

449
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,880
She's got one now too. Married, though.

450
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,000
Narciso Rodriguez is just amazing.

451
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,200
The guy she hooked,
his picture's always in the business pages.

452
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,200
For Crystal, that's like the classifieds
for a husband.

453
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,280
I can never remember that guy's name.
Everyone knows him.

454
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,800
- That's a beautiful ring, by the way.
- Oh, thank you.

455
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,120
On the wrong hand, though.
- It's the right hand.

456
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,640
My girlfriends gave it to me.
We gave each other one.

457
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,440
Haines, that's his name. Stephen Haines.

458
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,280
I was there when she met him.
Oh, boy, what a performance.

459
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,280
This Haines guy walks up
to the counter...

460
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,880
...serious type, expensive suit,
good-looking, little thinning on top...

461
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,560
...and he says he wants to buy
some perfume for his wife.

462
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,560
"What type of woman is she?"
Crystal says.

463
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,800
He says, "The kind that smells like soap. "
Which I thought was sweet.

464
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,600
But for Crystal, it was a challenge.

465
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,160
So then she says,
"Would you prefer something sexier?"

466
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,360
And she runs her eyes up and down him...

467
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,640
...the way a big cat looks
at a slow wildebeest.

468
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,440
I felt kind of bad for the guy.
He didn't stand a chance.

469
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,360
So then she picks up
the tester bottle of Jezebel...

470
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,920
That's the stuff you're wearing.

471
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,840
- She sprays it on her wrist and her arm
for him to smell...

472
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,360
...he starts sniffing around.

473
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,400
I guess he liked it more than he planned.

474
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,280
To tell you the truth,
I think this was a game for Crystal...

475
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,000
...until he took out his credit card,
and then she recognized his name.

476
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,200
And then what happened?

477
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,240
She really pursued him.
Then they just started seeing each other.

478
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,960
He takes her for nice dinners,
buys her clothes...

479
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,520
...sends her flowers in a vase.

480
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,440
- You know, the kind you keep.
I don't think that...

481
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,920
I don't think that, um...

482
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,120
I'm...

483
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,680
I just remembered
that I have to go somewhere.

484
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,080
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Was I talking too much again?

485
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:02,800
You know, I just try to entertain my clients
when they're sitting here, Mrs?

486
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,760
Haines.

487
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,520
Oh, God.

488
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:11,120
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
I'm so, so sorry, I had no idea.

489
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,720
Oh, me and my big mouth.
Is there anything I could do...?

490
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,000
No, just stop telling that story. I mean it.

491
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:20,440
I'll never mention it again.
I promise, I promise, Mrs. Haines.

492
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,440
Donna.

493
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,000
Good dirt. Oh, my God.

494
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,880
Hello, it's Mary for Sylvie again.

495
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,160
Is she still in that meeting?

496
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:35,200
Yes, if you could please have her call me
as soon as she gets out. Thank you.

497
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,560
Am I late?

498
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,120
I'm sorry, Mom.

499
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,880
I heard what happened.
Your father is a real shit.

500
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,480
I ordered you a gimlet.

501
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,520
I know,
you don't drink in the afternoon...

502
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:51,000
...but you will eventually,
so why not start now?

503
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,880
You wanna see a bad facelift?

504
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,000
Helen Danvers, 2 o'clock.

505
00:25:56,160 --> 00:26:00,120
She looks like she's re-entering
the Earth's atmosphere.

506
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,400
Honey, what can I do?
Do you want me to punish Daddy?

507
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:07,640
- Mom, Stephen's having an affair.
- What?

508
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,840
I can't believe those words
came out of my mouth.

509
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:13,240
- That just makes me sick to my stomach.
- Who is she, one of your friends?

510
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,080
No, she sells perfume at Saks.

511
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,120
She's a spritzer girl?

512
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,120
I mean, how could I not have known?

513
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:23,480
Three months ago,
he bought cowboy boots.

514
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:29,400
I just can't believe this is happening to me.
I thought we were happy.

515
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,640
- What are you gonna do?
- What do you mean?

516
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,840
- I'm gonna tell him to move out.
- Well, that's not very smart.

517
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,560
Someone once said...

518
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,000
...that when you don't know
what to do, do nothing.

519
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:43,600
Mom, my husband of 13 years
is having an affair.

520
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,960
I mean, do they talk about me
when they're in bed?

521
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,360
Do they laugh at me?

522
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,920
Please don't tell me to pretend
that nothing happened.

523
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,560
You have no idea how this feels.

524
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,840
Well, let me try.

525
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:03,080
It feels like someone
kicked you in the stomach.

526
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,440
It feels like your heart stopped beating.

527
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,080
It feels like that dream.

528
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,760
You know, the one where you're falling
and you want so desperately to wake up...

529
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:15,200
...before you hit the ground,
but it's all out of your control.

530
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,760
You can't trust anything anymore.

531
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,440
No one is who they say they are.

532
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,160
Your life is changed forever.

533
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,840
And the only thing to come out
of the whole ugly experience...

534
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,800
...is no one will ever be able
to break your heart like that again.

535
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,440
I can't believe you never told me that.

536
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,280
I wanted you to love your father.

537
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,480
Jeez, I mean, who was she?

538
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:46,640
Some little skank who sold fabric.

539
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,480
I met her once.

540
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,680
She wore too much makeup
and her bra straps were always showing.

541
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,760
- What did you do when you found out?
- Nothing.

542
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,160
Nothing?

543
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,160
I had a smart mother too.

544
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:02,760
Mary, that girl does not mean
anything more to Stephen...

545
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:06,480
...than the fabric whore
meant to your father.

546
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,360
If he loved her, believe me,
you would have felt it.

547
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,680
I can't fake it, Mom.
I can't be anywhere near him right now.

548
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,120
Then this is what I think we should do.

549
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:18,600
It's spring break.
We'll go away for a couple of weeks.

550
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,360
There is nothing like a heavy dose
of a man's mistress...

551
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,320
...to make him miss his wife.

552
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:26,960
What do you think this is,
some kind of 1930s movie?

553
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,400
That's ridiculous.

554
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,480
Can I remind you of something?

555
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,240
You have a daughter, just like I did.

556
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,240
This is not just about you.

557
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,920
Call Stephen.

558
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:40,240
Tell him I invited you and Molly
up to the cottage in Maine.

559
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,080
We'll leave tomorrow.

560
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:46,120
And I wouldn't discuss this
with any of your friends.

561
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,360
They'll all want to help,
and before you know it...

562
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:52,720
...you'll be taking care of them
instead of yourself.

563
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,520
Oh, my God.

564
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,520
I'm so sorry for you, baby.

565
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:02,920
But it's nice to know
you still need your mama.

566
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,440
Was that a sunrise we just saw?

567
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,520
Because I'm on the wrong side
of that thing.

568
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,680
Alex, stop complaining.

569
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:17,320
I just thought Mary could use a few pals
to take her to the airport.

570
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,680
You know why I don't
cultivate friendships?

571
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,280
So I don't have to take anyone
to the airport.

572
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,920
<i>At the next intersection, make a left turn.</i>

573
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,800
- Who the hell was that?
- The navigation lady.

574
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:31,560
She's always calm. She never talks back.
My husband's in love with her.

575
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,960
All right, I'm sensing something here.

576
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,360
Something's not being said.

577
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,360
- What's going on that I don't know about?
- Nothing's going on.

578
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,800
What would make you say that?

579
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,200
Alex, what is your take
on Mary and Stephen's marriage?

580
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,040
Um...

581
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,240
It looks perfect on the outside...

582
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,640
...but there's definitely something
going on there.

583
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,960
You know Mary doesn't like
looking at the cracks.

584
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,200
She's too busy filling them.

585
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,440
Our girl is all blue sky.

586
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,760
But sooner or later...

587
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,360
Why?

588
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,160
Mary doing somebody? Heh, heh.

589
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,440
- What makes you think it's Mary?
Edie.

590
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,440
- Is Stephen having an affair on Mary?
- Oh, for God's sake, Edie.

591
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,880
- What a mouth.
- I didn't say anything!

592
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,160
Is it somebody we know?

593
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,440
- Vault?
- Vault.

594
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,520
- Spritzer girl, Saks.
- No.

595
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,360
- Oh, my God, how's she taking it?
- Oh, she doesn't know.

596
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,640
What do you mean, she doesn't know?

597
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,080
What is wrong with you two?

598
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,920
We're in the vault, she's not?
Drag her ass into the vault.

599
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:40,400
Look, I have been struggling
with this for days, okay?

600
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,960
Mary and I have been best friends
since college.

601
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:46,000
- I think she should be told.
- Uh, yeah.

602
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,640
Or we just don't say anything.

603
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:51,120
Sylvie, Mary has to know, okay?

604
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,640
Now, that's the right thing to do.

605
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,600
You want me to tell her?

606
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,120
Because I'll tell her.

607
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,400
I don't have a problem with it.

608
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:08,200
Hi.
Hi, I could've taken a cab.

609
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:11,040
No, no, I know you sent, you know,
Molly to be with your mom.

610
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,560
And why should you
go to the airport alone?

611
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,040
All right, so you have all
the numbers at the house.

612
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,200
All the information.

613
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,400
- Oh, will you call the vet please, Dr?
- I will, Dr. Jones.

614
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,800
Oh, and the guy from the place
is coming to fix the...

615
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,840
- The sink, at 2.
Next week, Tuesday at 2.

616
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,680
- Okay.
That too.

617
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,520
Oh, hi.
- Hey.

618
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,880
What are you guys doing here?
- Just get in, okay?

619
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:36,080
- Come on, get in.
- No, let's get out.

620
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:43,920
Mary, there's a reason
why we are all here with you today.

621
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,960
Sylvie has something
she wants to talk to you about.

622
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:52,800
This is really hard, Mary, okay? L...

623
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,920
Oh, is this about the perfume bitch?

624
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:00,120
You knew and you didn't tell me?

625
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,600
Right now, honest to God,
Mary, I'm so hurt.

626
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,120
- You?
- Yeah.

627
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,640
This isn't happening to you,
this is happening to me.

628
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,720
I was trying to figure out how to tell you.

629
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,280
I'm not saying I didn't...
How can you not tell me?

630
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,200
All right, all right, all right!

631
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,400
It's out in the open, okay?

632
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,600
Fine, what I wanna know is,
what did he say when you confronted him?

633
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,080
I didn't confront him.
He doesn't know I know.

634
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,440
- What do you mean?
- Mary, that is ridiculous.

635
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,600
I'm not proud of it.

636
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,760
What are you saying?

637
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,480
He's supposed to know that you know.

638
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,920
Okay, okay! All right, I appreciate
all of you trying to help, I really do.

639
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:38,480
But please, don't dissect and analyze
every square inch of this right now.

640
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,640
I can't take it.

641
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,480
Just be there for me silently.

642
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,160
Okay, let's go.

643
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,000
I should not be operating
heavy machinery right now.

644
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,920
- Hey, Mom?
- Mm-hm.

645
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:03,280
- You know what'd be really cool?
- What?

646
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,640
If you and I
got mother-and-daughter tattoos.

647
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,560
Nice try.

648
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,120
Come on,
it would change your whole image.

649
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,000
What's wrong with my image?

650
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,160
Never mind.

651
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,240
So I can still get
the tattoo, though, right?

652
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,520
Yeah, right after I get my nose pierced.

653
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,640
How come you never just hear me?

654
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,280
I hear you, honey, I hear you.

655
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,400
You want a tattoo,
and you're not getting one.

656
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,000
I'm gonna go watch television.

657
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,200
Oh, Mol. Molly, come on,
stay out here with us.

658
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,360
It's a gorgeous day.

659
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:38,520
Is there anything I'm allowed to do?

660
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,880
You know, Mom, I think
it's gonna be warm enough this afternoon...

661
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,680
...to go for a swim.

662
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:48,040
I'll have to put on a bathing suit.

663
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:53,040
Men, they can just parade around
without a care in the world.

664
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,840
At what age do women
start covering themselves with tarps...

665
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,040
...just for a stroll on the beach?

666
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,440
- Oh, it's Stephen.
- Don't answer it.

667
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:07,480
Let him think you're doing something
incredibly interesting without him.

668
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:10,200
God, I hate the game-playing.

669
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:13,360
- It does feel good to get some control.
- Of course it does.

670
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,240
He's called three times a day
since we've been here.

671
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,840
He's practically begging you
to come home.

672
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,960
You can see where his heart is.

673
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:24,360
This would be so much easier
if I didn't love him.

674
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:27,880
There should be a pill that you can take
to make love go away.

675
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,040
Why would you wanna
make love go away?

676
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,840
It's hard enough to find it
in the first place.

677
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,960
It's Stephen.

678
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,680
All right, you can answer it now.

679
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,520
Hello? Oh, Stephen.

680
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,680
I'm dying to see what she looks like.

681
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,600
Okay, listen, Sylvie,
I'm just gonna put it on the record.

682
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,680
This is a bad idea.
We don't have a plan, you don't know...

683
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,440
- Oh, my God, would you look at that bag?
- So pretty.

684
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,960
Sylvie, I need an advance.

685
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,600
I am not going to enable you.

686
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,560
Finish your damn book.

687
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,080
Can I have this bag, Mommy?

688
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,560
Mommy, I'm tired of shopping.

689
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,960
Can we go? I wanna go.

690
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,200
We can't go.

691
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,320
Aunt Sylvie is stalking somebody.

692
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,200
When she's finished, we can leave.

693
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:18,160
I hate this store!

694
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,720
April?

695
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,120
I want you to listen to me.

696
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,080
I'm gonna say something
very important...

697
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:28,400
...and I want you to remember it
for the rest of your life.

698
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,000
Nobody hates Saks.

699
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,360
Now, let's do what we came here for.

700
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,520
Mommy, can we get something to eat?

701
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,960
Fragrances, this is Pat.

702
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,680
- She's with a customer.
I'm hungry.

703
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,960
- Can we eat somewhere soon, Mommy?
- Oh.

704
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:47,360
I'm starving.

705
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,200
Crystal.

706
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,760
Phone for you.

707
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,240
It's a guy.

708
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,560
Wow.

709
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:09,280
- She is fine.
- Oh, Jesus, Alex, not now.

710
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,320
- We've seen her, now let's get out of here.
- Not on your life.

711
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,000
Yeah, I'm with Sylvie.

712
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,280
Hello?

713
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,200
Stephen.

714
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,000
I was hoping it was you.

715
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:26,560
How have you been, baby?
I missed you this week.

716
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,880
Well, it's cruel and unusual punishment
to be without you this long.

717
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,720
I say we make up for lost time.

718
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:35,640
What if I cook us
a romantic dinner tonight?

719
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:39,000
The big white square thing with the fire
coming out of it is the stove.

720
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,000
Shh. Oh.

721
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,440
No, baby, of course.

722
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,600
No, no, no, your work comes first.

723
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,160
Don't worry.

724
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,040
I'll just save you a piece of cake
with a candle on it.

725
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,440
- Phew.
- Huh.

726
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,800
Oh, I didn't wanna tell you,
because I didn't want you to make a fuss...

727
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,880
...and I'll have other birthdays.

728
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,240
I would... No, no, no.

729
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,480
I would feel terrible taking you away
from important business.

730
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,280
Are you sure?

731
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,760
Oh, baby, I am one happy girl.

732
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:09,840
Okay, I'll see you at 8.
You know where. Mwah.

733
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,920
That stupid wife.

734
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:17,000
Ever since she's been gone to wherever,
he's been acting like a lost puppy.

735
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:20,520
I have an audition at 4:00.
Apparently now I'm cooking dinner.

736
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,280
How did this all happen?

737
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,000
You volunteered.
Oh, sorry, Pat, but I gotta go.

738
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:28,080
Can you find something to do tonight
so we can have the apartment?

739
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:31,360
Fine. And good luck on your audition.

740
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,640
Uh, excuse me.
Can I get some help, please?

741
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,560
- I was just leaving, but Pat can help you.
- Oh, I was told to ask for Crystal Allen.

742
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,760
Ow, give me that.
Oh, no, no.

743
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,800
- Is that you?
- Yeah.

744
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,840
I've heard you have a special way
of knowing what a customer needs.

745
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,120
Really? And where would you hear that?

746
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,520
- Around.
Pretty.

747
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,840
I've been wearing Chanel No. 5
since my christening.

748
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,960
I'm thinking of changing.
What would you suggest?

749
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,800
Hmm. Probably nothing too subtle.

750
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,160
You're right about that.

751
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,400
You always know exactly
where you stand with me.

752
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:08,000
No, I want a perfume
to be a reflection of my personality.

753
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:13,040
Smart, fearless, clever, loyal...

754
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:16,000
...protective of friends,
ruthless if crossed.

755
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,600
I want that.

756
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,600
You shopping for a perfume
or writing a personal ad? Ha, ha, ha.

757
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,040
A friend of mine
is wearing something new.

758
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,320
Her husband bought it for her here,
I think.

759
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:30,880
Edie, what's the name of that perfume
that Mary Haines is wearing?

760
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,840
- You know, the one Stephen bought for her.
- Ah.

761
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,120
Stephen Haines.

762
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,640
Maybe you waited on him.

763
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,440
He's good-looking, receding hairline.

764
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,800
Platinum card.

765
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,120
Maybe that rings a bell.

766
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:45,920
Oh, we know you're screwing Stephen,
and Mary is a friend of ours, so you stop it.

767
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,080
- Just stop it!
- Shh.

768
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,000
So he cheated on you,
and still you said nothing to him?

769
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,080
This is not modern, Mary.

770
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:06,040
Ever since I got back from Maine,
it's all flowers and foot rubs...

771
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,880
...and, "What can I do for you today?"

772
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:11,080
I mean, maybe my mother is right.
Maybe the affair was no big deal.

773
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,920
Maybe treating it that way
actually is the more modern thing.

774
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,560
- When did you become French?
- I'm not sleeping with him.

775
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:20,680
- Good. Make him suffer.
- Sylvie, let's stop talking about me, okay?

776
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,880
- How's everything with Gary?
- Oh, it's over.

777
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,200
He pressed his jeans.

778
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,760
- You are too choosy.
- No.

779
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,080
Yeah, and you know why that is?

780
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,320
You're afraid to choose.

781
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,440
- No, I am not.
- Yes, yes, you are.

782
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:39,160
Excuse me, I chose once, remember?

783
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,560
It was all very nice
until my career took off.

784
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,200
"Sylvie, I'm happy for you. "

785
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,360
He said, "I want you to fly.

786
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:49,000
I just don't think I can be with a woman
who has that kind of wingspan. "

787
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:51,400
- That was just him.
- Excuse me, no.

788
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:54,880
I'm sorry, men have a hard time
being with a successful woman.

789
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,920
So we shrink to fit, like you.

790
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:00,320
- What are you talking about?
- Yeah, like you were gonna be Donna Karan.

791
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,440
And then you put on the brakes
because you could eclipse Stephen.

792
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:07,000
When you fall in love, you don't think
about how it's gonna work out, Sylvie.

793
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,280
- You just go with your gut.
- Oh, please.

794
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,400
Like my first date with Stephen,
when he gave me that pumpkin.

795
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,240
Thank God it was Halloween.

796
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,720
That was an irresistible thing,
to be given a pumpkin on your first date.

797
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,960
- That's weird.
It was charming, you know.

798
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,040
Carving a pumpkin?
- We carved it together.

799
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,560
We were a really good team.
You know, 13 years.

800
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,160
Good afternoon, La Perla.
- Thirteen pumpkins.

801
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,840
That is what you think about
when it's all falling apart.

802
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,880
It's the pumpkin. The pumpkin matters.

803
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,480
I hate Halloween.
All those strangers at the door.

804
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:38,360
You know, someday, when you are not
looking and you're not thinking, Sylvie...

805
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,880
...you're gonna meet the man
you wanna marry.

806
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,480
I'm the man I wanna marry.

807
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,560
That's the problem.

808
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,240
Ooh, hey.

809
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,920
Sylvie, what do you think of this?

810
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,160
- On you?
- Yeah.

811
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,160
- Really?
- Yeah.

812
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,560
Stephen might get lucky tonight.

813
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:56,200
Mrs. Haines, it's been a while
since we've seen you.

814
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,720
Time for a new robe?

815
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,200
Hello, Grace. I'd like to try this on.

816
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,640
- Really?
- What is everyone's deal?

817
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,000
- What?
I think this is your size.

818
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:09,000
All right, I admit that I underestimated
the value of the slut factor in the bedroom.

819
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:11,960
Great. Maybe he'll leave some cash
on the nightstand.

820
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,760
Oh, I just don't understand
why they put fluorescent lighting...

821
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:17,920
...in dressing rooms.

822
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,760
Why would a woman buy anything
if it looks like her thighs...

823
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,600
...were hit by a meteor shower?

824
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,440
How are you doing in there, Ms. Allen?

825
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,280
- Do you need another size, another color?
Oh, no, I like it.

826
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,200
Don't go too far. I'm gonna need you.

827
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,920
No problem, Ms. Allen.

828
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:33,520
Okay, wow, is this just too much?
I mean...

829
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:36,840
No, it's... I think I'll go out,
and just get some other options, huh?

830
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,120
Is there a mirror with better light?
- Yes.

831
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,960
Out here in the hall.
But you probably don't wanna go...

832
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,200
I'm not shy.

833
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,480
Hmm.

834
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:55,680
I've got to say, you're my first customer
who's had the courage to try that on.

835
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,240
Do you have those cutlet things?

836
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,440
- You know, I need some lift.
- Oh, yeah.

837
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,680
I think I have to take this.
How much money is it?

838
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,280
It's Italian handmade lace.

839
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:07,240
That's why it's $650.

840
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,960
Does it come in any other colors?
- Champagne.

841
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:13,040
Ah. I love champagne.
I'll take it in a champagne as well.

842
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,960
Will that be cash or charge?

843
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,240
You take personal checks?

844
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,600
No, but I'd be happy
to open up a store charge.

845
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,560
It only takes a few minutes
to do a credit check.

846
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,560
Credit check.

847
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,280
I don't have time for a credit check.

848
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,720
Hey, what if I gave you the number
of someone who does have a credit card?

849
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,720
And I'm sure if you called him,
he'd be happy to give it to you.

850
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:34,960
We can try that.

851
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:38,840
- What's the gentleman's name?
- Stephen Haines.

852
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,800
He's a friend of the family.

853
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,440
Mrs. Haines is a client of ours.

854
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:48,720
In fact, she's in the dressing room
right across the hall.

855
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:52,400
Would you like me
to have her approve this for you?

856
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,440
No.

857
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,720
No, no, no.

858
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,840
Um, you see, I don't think
that would be in very good taste.

859
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,400
You see, I'm relatively new in town,
and I haven't had the pleasure...

860
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:06,920
...of meeting Mrs. Haines yet.

861
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:11,040
I would hate for this
to be our first introduction.

862
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,600
I'm sure you understand.

863
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:15,160
I do understand.

864
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,520
- I'll phone Mr. Haines.
- Thanks, sweetie.

865
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:30,800
Oh. You don't think it's flattering?

866
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
- Is that what you're thinking?
- Mary.

867
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36,320
She's here,
in the dressing room across the hall.

868
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,240
Crystal Allen.

869
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,720
What?

870
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:43,120
- How do you know?
- I saw her talking to the saleswoman.

871
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:46,920
She's spending a fortune, and, Mary,
she's putting it on Stephen's account.

872
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,280
Oh, that's not true.

873
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:51,560
If he's paying her bills, Mary,
it means he's still involved with her.

874
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:56,360
Well, I'm just gonna go home.
Can you just help me out?

875
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:57,920
Are you leaving?
- Help me off...

876
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:00,800
Mary, go in there.
- Help me off with this thing.

877
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,000
You've been running away
from this whole thing.

878
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:06,680
- What are you afraid of?
- Of being made a bigger fool, Sylvie.

879
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:10,640
Listen to me, that woman is working
her way into another person's life...

880
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,120
...and it happens to be yours.

881
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:15,000
And if you don't stand up to her
and face her...

882
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:18,720
...it's a matter of time before she's
carving the pumpkin with your daughter.

883
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,240
Now, I'm giving you permission
to behave badly.

884
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,800
You go in there and kick her ass.

885
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:27,760
- Go on.
- Okay.

886
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:30,480
- I'll be your cornerman, you just go.
- Go.

887
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:35,440
Go.

888
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,000
Go on.

889
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:39,480
- You can do it.
- Okay, I can't.

890
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:41,600
- Go.
- I can't do it.

891
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,280
Oh, shit.

892
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:47,880
- Excuse me?
- Are you kidding me?

893
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:50,120
- Excuse me?
- Are you...?

894
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,760
I'm Mary Haines.

895
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,200
Right, um.

896
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,400
Well, this is awkward.

897
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,880
- I guess he finally told you.
- No, no, no.

898
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:06,200
He never mentioned you,
but I've known about you.

899
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:07,480
- Really?
- Yeah.

900
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:10,600
- I'm surprised I haven't heard from you.
- Well, it's not my style.

901
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:14,200
But since you were in the vicinity,
I thought I'd introduce myself.

902
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:18,040
Um, look, Mrs. Haines, I am really sorry
for what this has done to you.

903
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,320
And I know Stephen
never meant to hurt you.

904
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,640
What? You don't know anything
about my husband.

905
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:27,120
I do know that a woman never steals
another woman's husband.

906
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:28,520
They usually go willingly.

907
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:32,120
Well, it sounds like you have
a lot of experience in that area.

908
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:35,320
You know, Stephen is a very smart man.

909
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:39,000
He's just way too smart
to take someone like you seriously.

910
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:40,240
I mean...

911
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,520
Mrs. Haines,
I know so many women like you.

912
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:47,000
You have your fancy friends
and your nice houses...

913
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:51,280
...your calendars are full of social events
and shopping dates and charity lunches...

914
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:54,280
...to make you feel like you're
doing something with your lives.

915
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:57,720
But eventually,
you stop paying attention to your men.

916
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,240
They get lonely.

917
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:05,000
And they come looking for someone
who makes them feel appreciated again.

918
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:09,680
And believe me,
they take that very, very seriously.

919
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:12,040
You know, I came in here with...

920
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:16,240
...I admit, just a ridiculous idea
that if you and I ever met...

921
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,000
...and you saw
that I was an actual human being...

922
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:21,880
...and not just some stray thought
out in Connecticut...

923
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:24,640
...that you might actually feel
a little bit of remorse.

924
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:28,440
One woman having that transcendent
moment of connect with another.

925
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:32,440
And that you might realize the scope
of the damage that you've done...

926
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:35,480
...not just to me, but to a family.

927
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,000
I have no idea what you just said.

928
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:41,720
I know, yeah. So I'm gonna put this
in terms that you can understand.

929
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:45,040
You are gonna stop seeing my husband.

930
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:47,680
I guess that's up to him, isn't it?

931
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:51,080
Listen, let me give you
a little bit of a tip.

932
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:53,040
Stephen...

933
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:58,920
Stephen would never like anything
that, uh, trashy.

934
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:03,880
Well, if Stephen doesn't like
anything I'm wearing, I take it off.

935
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,960
You were great, Mary.

936
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:12,680
Get me out of here.

937
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:14,160
Who are you, Stephen?

938
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:17,080
- Tell me, what's going on?
- Oh, she is really giving it to him.

939
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:19,600
And he is not saying much,
because, really, I mean...

940
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:23,040
...what could this cheating,
lying bastard say?

941
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,200
What else? What else?

942
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:27,640
Oh, so they argue some more,
and then Mary gets very quiet...

943
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:31,440
...and she says,
"Stephen, do you wanna be with her?"

944
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:32,640
- Oh, good move.
- Yeah.

945
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:33,800
Force his hand.

946
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:36,480
And he says, "Mary, I love you. "

947
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:40,160
Oh, yeah. Oh, please, predictable.

948
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:42,680
But I think Mary started listening to him.

949
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:44,240
So he keeps talking.

950
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:48,000
He says he never meant
for the affair to turn into anything.

951
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:51,640
And he tried to end it more than once.

952
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:55,320
Men get themselves into things,
then they don't know how to get out of it.

953
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:57,640
But here's
where he makes his big mistake.

954
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:03,160
He says he kept seeing Crystal
because he felt she got dependent on him.

955
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:05,680
- And that he didn't wanna hurt her.
- Hurt her?

956
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:09,120
That's exactly what Mary said,
then she makes her big mistake.

957
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:12,400
She says, "How could you not see
that she's just after your money?"

958
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:13,560
Oh, she blew it.

959
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:17,480
The last thing a man wants to hear is that
his wife is the only one stupid enough...

960
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:19,800
...to love him for himself.

961
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:22,080
Nobody knows how to argue.

962
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,640
I should run a school.

963
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:26,480
So now he asks her the big question.

964
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:29,200
Is there any way they can put it all
back together again?

965
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:32,200
You should have heard him.
It would have broke your heart.

966
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:33,480
Oh, who cares?

967
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:35,600
Do we still have jobs or not?

968
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:38,400
Mary said she wants a divorce.

969
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:41,080
- What did he say?
- He says...

970
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:43,560
...he'd wish she'd take some time
and think it over.

971
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,680
And that he would spend
the night at a hotel.

972
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:48,920
- What did she say?
- She threw her wedding band at him.

973
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:50,840
Oh, that's bad.

974
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,920
- Oh, that's very bad.
- Yeah.

975
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:57,760
Where the hell's my address book?

976
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,760
I have a woman who keeps offering me
a job. Barbara somebody.

977
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:03,640
What are you doing?
You can't desert them now.

978
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:07,080
Oh, my God. Shh.
I hear something.

979
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,680
That's it.

980
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:15,440
We're on a sinking ship, Uta.

981
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:18,040
I have a cardinal rule.

982
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:22,160
Never get attached to the family.
This is exactly why.

983
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:27,160
And that, Uta, is why the revolutionaries
threw tea into Boston Harbor.

984
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:30,520
I need to eat something.
That's low-fat, low-carb, fat-free...

985
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:32,240
There's fruit everywhere.

986
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,400
- Where's the junk?
- You don't let me buy any.

987
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:36,800
Why don't I fix you a drink?

988
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:39,280
All right.

989
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:42,640
I think you both should know
Stephen and I are splitting up.

990
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:45,040
Yeah, he's been having an affair.

991
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,840
- Get out of here.
- I don't believe it.

992
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,480
Yeah, yeah.

993
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:51,000
And let me tell you
how stupid I am, okay?

994
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:53,960
I had myself convinced
that it was no big deal.

995
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:56,000
Just a little chapter, not the whole book.

996
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:59,000
And if I just put the old blinders on,
rose above it...

997
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:01,160
...everything would work itself out.

998
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:02,480
Bullshit.

999
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:05,840
I mean, it's not like I was deliriously happy
every single day...

1000
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
...of this marriage, you know?

1001
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,320
But did I screw around? No.

1002
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,520
I could have, by the way.

1003
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:15,840
I really could have
because men have come on to me plenty.

1004
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,200
All right, once or twice.

1005
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:20,160
But I thought about it,
because this just in:

1006
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:26,520
Thirteen years of sex with the same man
can be a little bit boring, all right?

1007
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:29,840
I mean, Stephen had his bag of tricks
and I knew them all.

1008
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,080
But did I complain?

1009
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:33,880
Did I go out
and bang the Federal Express guy?

1010
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:36,840
And let me tell you something else.

1011
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:39,320
Stephen does not know
how good he had it.

1012
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:43,200
There is nobody, and I mean nobody,
who's gonna give that man...

1013
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:45,320
...a better time in bed than I did.

1014
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:48,280
I could suck the nails out of a board,
and that is a fact.

1015
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:53,680
Oh, God.

1016
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:56,320
God.

1017
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:59,960
You can't think straight right now.

1018
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:03,320
You know what I do
when I have a problem?

1019
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:09,640
Before I go to sleep, I tell myself
I'm gonna wake up with the answer.

1020
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,760
And that does it. I do.

1021
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:12,960
You try it.

1022
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:15,600
You go on upstairs
and get a good night's sleep.

1023
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:18,160
And tomorrow morning,
it'll all look better.

1024
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:20,240
Oh, Maggie.

1025
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:22,760
Go on, you'll feel better.

1026
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:29,600
I love you guys.

1027
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:34,200
She's not gonna dump him.

1028
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:40,040
I know how she feels about that man
and how he feels about her.

1029
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:43,600
He'll be back in this house
by the end of the week.

1030
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:27,600
I don't understand.

1031
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:29,480
Why did this happen to me?

1032
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:32,920
Oh, sweetie, listen.

1033
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:36,240
Listen, it happens
in every relationship, okay?

1034
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:38,880
Eventually,
somebody betrays somebody else.

1035
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:42,320
It's either in a big way
or in a million little ones.

1036
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,360
It's just the nature of it, okay?

1037
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:47,160
Oh, Jesus.

1038
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:49,480
Oh, God.

1039
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,600
- What am I gonna do?
- You'll figure it out.

1040
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:56,720
We'll figure it out.

1041
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:03,960
Come on, we need to pull out
the big idea here.

1042
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:06,640
We should focus on the cover.
How to get it to pop.

1043
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:10,200
Okay, what about this for a cover blurb?
"The 45-Minute Orgasm. "

1044
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:12,560
Forty-five minutes? Who has the time?

1045
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:17,400
Listen, I really wanna make a statement
with this issue.

1046
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:20,920
It's time to cut ourselves away
from the herd, talk up to the reader.

1047
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:22,480
I thought we already were.

1048
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:25,400
What about the piece we did
on living an authentic life?

1049
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:26,800
Oh, come on.

1050
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:28,960
We tell women
to feel good about themselves...

1051
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:31,600
...and then we print 15 pieces
on crazy diets.

1052
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:35,440
We run ads for wrinkle creams,
the models are 20 years old.

1053
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:38,600
- We're driving women mad.
- Okay.

1054
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:41,960
I know I'm the new kid,
but here's what I would do...

1055
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:43,600
<i>...if I were in charge of CACHET.</i>

1056
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:46,720
I would tie each issue to a theme.

1057
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:47,880
Brand it.

1058
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:50,240
By branding each issue,
we brand the magazine...

1059
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:53,200
...giving it a more unique identity
on the newsstand.

1060
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:56,120
I would make sure
that each theme had an edge.

1061
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:57,360
A sense of humor.

1062
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:59,960
For instance, the revenge issue.

1063
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:02,640
How to get it, who to stick it to...

1064
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:05,040
...the fine art of holding a grudge.

1065
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:08,040
We put an actress on the cover,
someone young, hot.

1066
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:10,520
And we make the whole thing irresistible.

1067
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:13,400
We become the guilty pleasure
of the publishing world...

1068
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:16,040
...and that is how we turn it around.

1069
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:20,080
Come on, Annie.

1070
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:23,120
Revenge? It's so retro.

1071
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:25,000
It's old-think.

1072
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:28,880
Don't we all have better things to do?
It's the opposite of what I'm talking about.

1073
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,000
But I would buy that magazine.

1074
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:37,320
Uh, I think we should take a break, okay?
Let all this percolate.

1075
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:38,960
We'll pick it up after lunch.

1076
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:41,320
Just think about it.

1077
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:43,480
It's a good idea.

1078
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:49,520
Let me tell you,
editors, they live in fear of a girl like that.

1079
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:53,360
They walk into your world, you're thinking,
"Wait, am I out of the loop here?"

1080
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:56,600
- I mean, "Am I missing the trends?"
- Climb higher.

1081
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:59,920
- Can't we take a break?
- No breaks.

1082
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:02,160
What are the two most feared words
in English?

1083
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:05,560
- "Pool party. "
- "Keep climbing. "

1084
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:12,200
Wait a minute. Let me down, okay?

1085
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:13,840
Thanks.

1086
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:17,840
Hey, Bailey Smith, right?

1087
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,160
Sylvie Fowler.
We met at the MTV Awards.

1088
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:22,000
Oh, right, right, right, yeah.

1089
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:25,440
<i>So how are things
in the hot seat at CACHET?</i>

1090
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:30,800
<i>Well, I'm not gonna be happy
until I take a nice big chunk out of Vogue.</i>

1091
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,720
- You know how I'm gonna do that?
- How?

1092
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:35,480
By putting star writers
on the magazine, like you.

1093
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:39,520
Oh, well, that is a nice compliment,
but I'm not for sale.

1094
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:42,720
<i>- I'm really happy at The Post.
- Excuse me, but I don't know why.</i>

1095
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:45,120
You made a reputation
writing brilliant profiles...

1096
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,760
...and now
you're writing gossip for a tabloid.

1097
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:50,160
Wait, I am syndicated.

1098
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:52,640
I don't have to worry
about money anymore.

1099
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:56,040
You know, anyway,
I write about people, not fashion.

1100
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:57,480
That's what I want you to do.

1101
00:55:57,640 --> 00:56:00,600
Write about interesting people
in your own irreverent way.

1102
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:02,120
You'll sell magazines.

1103
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:05,320
I hear your circulation's down.

1104
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:09,560
And didn't you have
some staff defections last week?

1105
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:11,920
Some people can't take the hills.

1106
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:18,760
You know, um, I would consider
doing some pieces for you...

1107
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:21,480
...but I would need something in return.

1108
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:22,840
Well, you name it.

1109
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,880
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1110
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:30,160
Well, I'm doing a series of columns
on high-profile New York marriages.

1111
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:33,080
I hear one of them is breaking up.

1112
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:34,960
Oh. Oh.

1113
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:37,600
- You know who I'm talking about.
- I don't know anything.

1114
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,440
And who cares, anyway?

1115
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,160
Oh, come on.

1116
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:45,560
Messy divorces sell more papers
than presidential campaigns.

1117
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:48,240
Sounds like you've written a story.
What you need me for?

1118
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:52,440
You know I need confirmation
from some ironclad source.

1119
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,360
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

1120
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:58,120
Just because you wouldn't do
a favor for me...

1121
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:00,720
...doesn't mean I won't do one for you.

1122
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:05,760
One of my spies said
they saw your publisher last night...

1123
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:09,080
<i>...having dinner with Talia Greene
from Harper's Bazaar.</i>

1124
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:13,400
Wait, I am not worried, okay?

1125
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:14,920
Ned wouldn't replace me.

1126
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:17,880
He's completely committed
to my vision for the magazine.

1127
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:19,000
Sure, I'm sure.

1128
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:23,800
But it's just that I heard that there
was some heavy wooing going on.

1129
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:26,520
Bailey, do not print that, okay?

1130
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:29,080
What little staff I have left
would smell blood.

1131
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:31,680
<i>It would completely destroy
my credibility at CACHET...</i>

1132
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:33,560
...and then I really am out the door.

1133
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:37,080
I know, it's incredible, isn't it,
how a little piece of gossip like that...

1134
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:41,240
...has the potential
to actually unravel an entire career?

1135
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:46,160
<i>Because, really, when you think about it,
where would you go if you left CACHET?</i>

1136
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:05,640
This is the last time
you're picking the restaurant.

1137
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,960
If they're gonna plaster your life
in the paper...

1138
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:10,800
...you would think
they would at least run a decent picture.

1139
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:12,680
Especially next to that Crystal.

1140
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:16,240
Shouldn't she have to have a permit
to wear a dress like that?

1141
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,280
You're awfully quiet for a change.

1142
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,520
Oh, tough day at work, is all.

1143
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:25,200
She's here.

1144
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,360
- Hi.
Hi.

1145
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:29,200
- Alex picked the restaurant, right?
- Heh, heh, heh.

1146
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:31,080
- Of course.
- That looks good.

1147
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:37,400
So everybody's seen it, right?

1148
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:40,160
Okay, no big elephants on the table.

1149
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:43,800
Just when you thought
it couldn't get any shittier.

1150
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:47,440
Okay, do you wanna have a big laugh
about it right now, huh?

1151
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:49,160
Or you wanna run off with a woman?

1152
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:53,040
- Lf you did, this would be the place.
- Maybe a margarita and a woman.

1153
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,360
I like that.

1154
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:57,960
I think it's gonna be okay, ladies.
She's turned the page.

1155
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:01,080
Yeah, I've turned the page.
I hired a lawyer today.

1156
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:07,280
Mary, um, don't you think
maybe it's too soon for lawyers?

1157
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:09,640
Let things settle down.

1158
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,960
A month from now,
everything could look different.

1159
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:13,840
- What?
- I know.

1160
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:18,960
Okay, I'm gonna take a risk here
and say something that may be...

1161
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:21,480
There are two sides to every story.

1162
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:25,960
Any one of us is capable,
under the right circumstances...

1163
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:29,560
...of making a very big mistake.

1164
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,280
Right? Right?

1165
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:37,840
And a good marriage counselor
might ask:

1166
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,240
"And how were you culpable
in this marriage?"

1167
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:42,680
Well, I married an asshole.
That's how I'm culpable.

1168
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:44,120
Which side are you on?

1169
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:46,000
- I'm not taking sides.
Well, pick one.

1170
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:47,120
I'm on your side.

1171
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:51,120
- My money's on you.
- All right.

1172
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:53,840
Okay. Here's what I wanna know.

1173
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:57,320
I wanna know how somebody
like Bailey Smith faces herself in the mirror.

1174
00:59:57,480 --> 01:00:01,400
I wanna know how somebody can make a
living feeding off of somebody else's pain.

1175
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:03,240
Mary, it's my fault.

1176
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:06,440
Okay.

1177
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:09,680
Bailey Smith knew
I was about to be fired...

1178
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:12,320
...and she knew
that I needed her on the magazine.

1179
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:14,160
So she practically blackmailed me.

1180
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:17,440
I didn't give her any information.
She had all the details already.

1181
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:21,040
She just said, "Nod if it's true. "
And that's all I did, is nod.

1182
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:25,200
I was in a terrible position.

1183
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:27,520
I was scared.

1184
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:30,760
You know, people do terrible things
when they're scared.

1185
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:32,320
And this is terrible.

1186
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:34,200
I know that. I know.

1187
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:38,320
What is going on with you?

1188
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:45,840
Guys, I'm fighting for a job
that I've worked for my whole life.

1189
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:02,120
What was it that you said, Sylvie?

1190
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:04,920
You said that betrayal is inevitable
in any relationship.

1191
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:07,120
I thought you were just talking
about marriage.

1192
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:09,440
This is so much worse.

1193
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:24,920
<i>You don't have
what it takes to run a company like this.</i>

1194
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:27,400
<i>Now, take a walk and never look back.</i>

1195
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:31,040
<i>My father will never let you
get away with this, Ramona.</i>

1196
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:34,200
<i>I'm sleeping with your father.</i>

1197
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:42,000
<i>Who knows moisture better than Dove?</i>

1198
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:45,080
For God's sakes.
Middle of the afternoon.

1199
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:48,000
Your daughter's gonna be home
from school any minute.

1200
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:51,800
You want her to see her mother
in her bathrobe again, huh?

1201
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:55,080
I don't look at clocks anymore.
It's very liberating.

1202
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:06,600
Haines residence.

1203
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:09,080
Oh. Hello.

1204
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:12,560
Heh, heh.
Sure, I still recognize your voice.

1205
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:15,840
Well, me?

1206
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:17,880
Holding down the fort.

1207
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:19,640
Uh...

1208
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:22,960
I'll see if she's still here.

1209
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:25,960
- It's Mr. Haines. He's on the phone.
- Oh.

1210
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:27,600
Tell him I'm not here.

1211
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:30,800
I'm a bad liar. If I were any better,
I'd be embezzling from you.

1212
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:32,760
I don't wanna talk to him. I'm busy.

1213
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:35,920
Okay, look, I'm the housekeeper.

1214
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:38,440
I cook, I clean, I run errands
and that's it.

1215
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:40,520
I'm not your secretary.
I'm not your mother.

1216
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:42,600
I'm not your pal. I'm not involved.

1217
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:45,440
Now, you get over here
and take care of your business.

1218
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:53,040
Hello, Stephen.

1219
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:55,680
I haven't talked to the appraiser.
I'll do it next week.

1220
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:57,240
Let's go. Get out of here, come on.

1221
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:58,640
Oh.

1222
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:03,000
Well, I'm sure she'd love
to carve a pumpkin with you.

1223
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:07,080
Well, thank you for the invitation,
but I think you two are...

1224
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:09,200
You'd be better off on your own.

1225
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:14,000
Because I wouldn't have the first idea
how to be around you right now, Stephen.

1226
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:17,480
No, I already told you, it's over.
No marriage counselor.

1227
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:19,920
I'll have Molly call you.

1228
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:25,560
Oh, sweetie.

1229
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:27,600
Oh, I am so sorry.

1230
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:30,200
I didn't mean for you to hear that.

1231
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:41,920
<i>Mary, I know you're there.</i>

1232
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:43,560
<i>Why won't you return my calls?</i>

1233
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:45,400
<i>We have to talk about this.</i>

1234
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:50,120
<i>Hey, it's bad form
to screen calls, Mary. Pick up.</i>

1235
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:51,320
<i>Pick up.</i>

1236
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:32,320
- May I help you?
- Ahh!

1237
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:34,720
What do you think you're doing...

1238
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:36,680
...sneaking up on me like that?

1239
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:39,880
What are you doing
casing the house like a Jehovah's Witness?

1240
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:41,880
I am looking for Mary, okay?

1241
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:44,600
I've left her a lot of messages,
and she hasn't called me.

1242
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:46,600
- She's not here.
- Where is she?

1243
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:47,760
Out of town.

1244
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:50,440
- What about Molly?
- Molly is at school.

1245
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:52,560
That's where the kids go
during the week.

1246
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:54,960
Heh, heh. Cute.

1247
01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:57,920
Are we done? I have a lot to do.

1248
01:04:58,080 --> 01:05:01,680
Besides, your Pradas
are wrecking my perennials.

1249
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:25,040
It's Jason.

1250
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:27,080
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

1251
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:28,560
Ask him if he likes me.

1252
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:30,120
No, you.

1253
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:32,760
Oh, man.

1254
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:34,520
Who's that?

1255
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:36,920
One of my mom's friends.

1256
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:39,960
- You'd better go.
- Okay, well, see you later.

1257
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:41,800
See you.

1258
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:46,760
Hey.

1259
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:48,400
Small world, isn't it?

1260
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:52,200
So why aren't you in school?

1261
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:54,920
I didn't feel like it today.

1262
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:56,560
Huh.

1263
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:59,440
So this is kind of a new look
for you, huh?

1264
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:01,880
I leave the house in my uniform.

1265
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:05,280
And then after school,
I change into the stuff I hid in my backpack.

1266
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:07,440
A lot of the girls do it.

1267
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:08,960
Oh.

1268
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:10,680
Clever.

1269
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:13,480
You wouldn't happen
to have a cigarette, would you?

1270
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:20,040
Thanks.

1271
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:21,720
Hey.

1272
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:24,880
- Does your mom know you smoke?
- No.

1273
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:27,400
And don't tell her.

1274
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:28,880
I do it so I won't eat.

1275
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:32,280
Your weight is fine.

1276
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:34,440
I hate my body.

1277
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:36,600
I wanna look like the models
in your magazine.

1278
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:38,800
Nobody looks like those girls, okay?

1279
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,120
Not even them.

1280
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:43,280
They're all airbrushed and retouched.

1281
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:46,320
Then why don't you just put
regular people in there?

1282
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:49,240
I know it's hypocritical.
Life is complicated.

1283
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:53,160
Yeah, I'm just starting to figure that out.

1284
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:56,280
Do you wanna talk about it?

1285
01:06:57,640 --> 01:06:59,120
No.

1286
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:01,520
Okay.

1287
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:07,320
How old were you when you had sex?

1288
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:10,000
Thirty.

1289
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:16,280
It was horrible. It hurt like hell.

1290
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:18,240
And it was totally embarrassing...

1291
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:21,360
...because we had no idea
what we were doing.

1292
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:24,160
We were up in his room one night.

1293
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:28,120
Big Farrah Fawcett poster
staring down on the bed.

1294
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:30,400
<i>Star Wars sheets, it was...</i>

1295
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:32,480
It was just tragic.

1296
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:35,640
I didn't have sex again
for a really long time.

1297
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:39,840
But then I met somebody,
and it was worth the wait.

1298
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:43,520
We were crazy for each other.

1299
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:47,960
And then magically,
and it was all really easy.

1300
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:51,040
Basically, you're telling me exactly
what my mother would say...

1301
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:52,720
...if I could even ask her.

1302
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:54,760
Don't have sex until you're in love.

1303
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:56,200
No.

1304
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:58,960
No, I've had pretty great sex
just for the hell of it.

1305
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:00,800
I won't lie to you.

1306
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:03,920
But there's no sex like the kind
you have when you love somebody...

1307
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:06,160
...and they love you back.

1308
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:08,360
You'd make the coolest mother.

1309
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:09,960
Really? No, I wouldn't.

1310
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:11,560
Really?

1311
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:14,040
I don't know,
kids don't seem to take to me.

1312
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:16,600
You'd be a great mom.

1313
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:18,520
Not like mine.

1314
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:22,640
I can be in the same room with her,
and it's like she's not even there.

1315
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:26,240
Listen to me, Molly.
I know you're going through a tough time.

1316
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:30,680
And if there's anything you ever
wanna talk about, just call me, okay?

1317
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:32,560
Promise you'll call me.

1318
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:34,520
Tell me you promise.

1319
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:37,480
I promise.

1320
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:38,920
Okay.

1321
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:42,400
So where is your mom, anyway?

1322
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:48,160
All right, everyone,
take a deep, cleansing breath.

1323
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:51,280
Look around.

1324
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:53,560
Respect the power of nature.

1325
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:55,920
This is why you have come to the Camp.

1326
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:57,960
Let it heal you.

1327
01:08:58,280 --> 01:09:00,400
So divorce?

1328
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:02,080
How many?

1329
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:04,720
Hold on, I'm coming.

1330
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:06,520
Don't start without me.

1331
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:09,600
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

1332
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:16,720
I'm just not used to getting up at the crack
of frigging dawn. Excuse my French.

1333
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:18,480
Is this the time you always start?

1334
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:22,320
Because I'm pretty sure
the lake will still be here at noon.

1335
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:25,680
We always canoe at dawn.

1336
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:28,920
I always fake my orgasms.
That doesn't make it right.

1337
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:32,000
Let's go.

1338
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:33,560
Lift.

1339
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:36,720
Swing.

1340
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:38,800
- Hoist.
Oh, God.

1341
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,240
You've got to be kidding.

1342
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:41,920
Turn.

1343
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:44,120
March.

1344
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:02,760
Oh, please. God.

1345
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:06,400
- Forget it.
- Oh!

1346
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:08,720
I already tried it.

1347
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:11,120
Oh, you scared me.

1348
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:15,560
And how bad an idea was this
in a place with a padlocked refrigerator?

1349
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,240
Leah, right?
Right.

1350
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:22,960
Mary. I mean, I am just so hungry.

1351
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:26,560
I'm starving. You need the Hubble
Telescope to see what they put on our plate.

1352
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:29,200
This place makes Betty Ford
look like Disneyland.

1353
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:30,640
And I ought to know.

1354
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:32,920
I ran screaming out of Betty twice.

1355
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:35,400
Look at that.

1356
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,680
Oh, no. No, thank you.

1357
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:40,520
How did you get that in here?
They even took away my Altoids.

1358
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:44,400
I made friends with Buck, the ranger boy.

1359
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:46,320
Another... Guess what.

1360
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:48,760
Aspiring actor.

1361
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:51,840
I thought I had left them
all behind in la-la land.

1362
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,440
You know, where your dentist
is writing a screenplay...

1363
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:58,200
...and your gardener's playing Willy Loman
down at a dinner theater in Torrance.

1364
01:10:58,360 --> 01:11:01,080
He got me the joint, I took his headshot.

1365
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:03,560
Are you an agent?

1366
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:04,760
What do you think?

1367
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:08,640
- How long have you been an agent?
- Oh, since 1852.

1368
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:12,120
At ICM, they call me the Countess.

1369
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:16,440
I can turn anybody into a star,
even our little ranger boy.

1370
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:19,080
And why not? Look at him, he's so cute.

1371
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:21,600
He's cute, I'm bored,
my guesthouse is empty.

1372
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:24,400
Who knows, he could turn out
to be the next Michael Douglas.

1373
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:27,080
Another dirtbag who left me, by the way.

1374
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:30,200
So, what are you in for?

1375
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:33,400
Oh, well, I just ran away from home.

1376
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:37,200
I got fired from all my jobs.
Wife, mother, daughter.

1377
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:42,080
And I broke up with my best friend,
which, you know, that was the worst.

1378
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:45,520
- I just bailed out of husband number four.
- Four?

1379
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:47,880
- No, five.
- Five?

1380
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:51,000
I keep blocking one of them out
because he tried to kill me.

1381
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:56,200
- What?
- We were on a ski lift in Aspen and I "fell. "

1382
01:11:57,240 --> 01:12:00,400
- What did you do?
- Oh, believe me, I took care of him.

1383
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:01,680
By the time I was done...

1384
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:04,880
...there was nothing left but the hair plugs
and the asphalt on the driveway.

1385
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:09,640
- Ooh, shh. Shh.
- What?

1386
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:12,640
- Why do you keep getting married?
- Oh.

1387
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:18,440
In the end, that's really all there is.

1388
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:22,320
Okay. All right, give me that thing.

1389
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:25,360
Haven't done this
since I was a freshman in college.

1390
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:27,880
I ate an entire tube of toothpaste.

1391
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:29,280
Wait.

1392
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:31,400
Okay.

1393
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:36,320
All right.

1394
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:37,800
All right, here's the thing.

1395
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:41,280
I'm just a good person, you know.
I just am.

1396
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:44,320
I really try to do the right thing, I do.
I try to...

1397
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:47,320
You know, I let the person
with the one item go ahead of me...

1398
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:48,480
...in the grocery line.

1399
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:51,000
I give money to homeless people.
I recycle.

1400
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:53,040
I never cheat.

1401
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:56,080
Okay, well, once, I cheated.

1402
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,360
- Really?
- Yeah.

1403
01:12:58,520 --> 01:12:59,560
I was playing Monopoly.

1404
01:12:59,720 --> 01:13:03,160
I was the little top hat,
and I moved it a couple extra spaces there.

1405
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:07,920
But I was just a kid,
so that probably doesn't count.

1406
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:10,840
So why am I going on and on about this?
What was my point here?

1407
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,360
Oh, boy, a talker.

1408
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:15,440
I'm gonna have to figure this out,
you know.

1409
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:16,600
I am.

1410
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:18,280
I gotta figure out why...

1411
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:21,520
...at this particular juncture,
my whole world has come tumbling down.

1412
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:23,960
Can you not bogart that, please?
Thank you.

1413
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:28,440
I've spent an entire lifetime
trying to be everything to everyone...

1414
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:32,080
...and somehow,
somebody is always disappointed.

1415
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:36,280
You know, my dear, sometimes
there's a reason why people's paths cross.

1416
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:41,880
Let me give you
Leah Miller's secret to life.

1417
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:44,920
Don't give a shit about anybody.

1418
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:47,360
Be selfish.

1419
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:52,560
Because once you ask yourself
the question, "What about me?"...

1420
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:55,080
...everything changes for the better.

1421
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:59,520
I mean, after all, who are you?

1422
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:01,960
What do you want, Mary?

1423
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:00,720
Oh. Excuse me.

1424
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:04,280
Excuse me.

1425
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:07,120
Hi, I'm looking for my mother,
Catherine Frazier.

1426
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:08,520
How's she doing?

1427
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:11,320
She's still in some pain,
but that's to be expected.

1428
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:13,160
She's in there.

1429
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:15,800
- Oh, thank you.
- Right there.

1430
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:22,600
It'd be nice
up in your room at this time...

1431
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:23,920
Mom?

1432
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:25,360
Mm-mm.

1433
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:30,480
Nurse.
Get you something for the pain.

1434
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:31,840
- Mom?
No.

1435
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,160
Mary.

1436
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:35,000
Over here.

1437
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:38,800
Oh, Mom. Does it hurt?

1438
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:42,320
I just spent thousands of dollars
to look rested.

1439
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:44,800
Of course it hurts.

1440
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:46,960
You look great.

1441
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:48,280
Oh, thank you, thank you.

1442
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:50,320
I just can't believe you did this.

1443
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:52,440
Have you looked around lately?

1444
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:55,400
There are no 60-year-old women.

1445
01:16:55,560 --> 01:16:57,480
I was the only one left.

1446
01:16:57,640 --> 01:16:59,920
No, Mom,
I'm happy you did what you wanted to do.

1447
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:02,320
Really, really.
What have you always said to me?

1448
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:03,880
Don't look back, no regrets.

1449
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:06,960
I'm so full of shit.

1450
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:09,200
I have plenty of regrets.

1451
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:14,360
I regret I never accomplished
anything of my own.

1452
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:16,040
I was ambivalent.

1453
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:20,200
And frankly, I wanted things.

1454
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:23,760
A big house, beautiful clothes.

1455
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:29,840
It was easier to get status from your father
than to get it for myself.

1456
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:32,120
I know I failed you in a lot of ways,
Mary.

1457
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:35,440
But probably none more than that.

1458
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:37,440
No, Mom.

1459
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:40,560
Do you wanna have
a little bit of tea there?

1460
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:42,520
Thanks.

1461
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:46,960
Well, I've been thinking
about going back to work.

1462
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:48,720
Not for Dad.

1463
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:50,840
I wanna design my own collection.

1464
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:52,560
Whoa.

1465
01:17:52,720 --> 01:17:55,040
- What brought that on?
- Hitting bottom.

1466
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:57,680
Having nothing left to lose.
I highly recommend it.

1467
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:02,360
If it wouldn't blow out 80 stitches,
I'd be smiling now.

1468
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:05,360
I don't wanna take on
more than I can handle.

1469
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:06,760
Just a small collection.

1470
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:09,680
- Where are you gonna get the money?
- I'll find some backers.

1471
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,640
- What about my inheritance?
- Oh, no, Mom.

1472
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:15,560
I never did anything with it.

1473
01:18:16,040 --> 01:18:17,960
What could be a better investment
than you?

1474
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:19,760
No, that's not why I came here.

1475
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:22,320
Oh, please. I'm in no condition to argue.

1476
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:26,760
You know something?

1477
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:30,000
Someday, when I'm sitting here
with my head in a helmet...

1478
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:34,520
...I hope my daughter has as much love
for me as I do for you right now.

1479
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:36,320
Huh.

1480
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:39,920
You are even more full of shit than I am.

1481
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:41,640
Yeah.

1482
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:16,000
Ned, please, um.

1483
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:17,160
I know.

1484
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:21,920
It's not the strongest issue I've turned out,
but next month is a whole different story.

1485
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:25,920
Bailey Smith is writing a profile
on Christiane Amanpour...

1486
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:30,160
...and Alex Fisher is getting me
some advanced material on her...

1487
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:35,640
Ned, you can't do this.

1488
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:39,000
Nobody turns a magazine around
in under a year.

1489
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:42,240
Just give me three more issues, okay?

1490
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:45,000
I have got this great idea.

1491
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:48,560
How about we do a whole issue
on revenge?

1492
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:50,040
How to get it...

1493
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:52,200
...who to stick it to...

1494
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:54,480
...the lost art of holding a grudge.

1495
01:19:54,680 --> 01:19:57,480
How to construct the perfect rumor.

1496
01:19:58,280 --> 01:20:01,960
The 10 best random acts of getting even.

1497
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:05,480
And we'll put a hot young actress
on the cover.

1498
01:20:06,360 --> 01:20:07,920
Yes.

1499
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:11,520
Thank you.

1500
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:14,480
Yeah, I think it'll be brilliant too.

1501
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:16,880
Okay, then.

1502
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:20,080
I'll see you in the morning.

1503
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:26,120
Hello?

1504
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:27,960
Hello?

1505
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:29,960
Molly?

1506
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:32,400
Where is everybody?
Where is everybody?

1507
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:33,640
Here.

1508
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:34,840
Hey. Oh, Maggie.

1509
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,880
All that fabric from Italy?
The whole dye lot was off.

1510
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:41,360
I had to completely recut a pattern
and the fit model didn't show up.

1511
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:44,840
But it is going to be good.
Maggie, it's gonna be so good.

1512
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:47,240
- Where's Molly?
- She's out there.

1513
01:20:49,480 --> 01:20:50,640
What is she doing?

1514
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:54,680
Well, she says
she doesn't want to be a woman.

1515
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:01,400
Hey, Mol.

1516
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,280
Wow.

1517
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:07,520
You've got quite a little bonfire
going there.

1518
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:11,000
I started it off with the slenders
and now I'm adding the supers.

1519
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:12,880
That's the trick.

1520
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:20,680
Wouldn't it be just great if when
you're born, they give you a rulebook...

1521
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:25,040
...so every time you came up against
something you had no idea how to handle...

1522
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:28,240
...you just look it up in the book
and there would be the answer?

1523
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:33,040
You know,
I used to feel sorry for the kids in my class.

1524
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:36,480
Every other weekend with Dad
until Mommy's boyfriend sleeps over...

1525
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:38,160
...then Dad gets you two in a row.

1526
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:40,560
I used to feel sorry for them.

1527
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:42,280
Now I'm one of them.

1528
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:46,880
Listen, Molly,
I know that I haven't been here for you.

1529
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:50,360
And I'm very sorry about that.
We have a lot to talk about.

1530
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:52,760
I can't talk to you like I talk to Sylvie.

1531
01:21:54,920 --> 01:21:57,800
- You've been talking to Sylvie?
- She's been helping me.

1532
01:21:58,160 --> 01:22:01,000
Well, I wanna help you.
Why won't you let me help you?

1533
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:04,360
Because all you'll do is tell me
that everything is going to be fine...

1534
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:06,040
...and it's not.

1535
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:08,920
Dad's living in an apartment
that barely has any furniture.

1536
01:22:09,080 --> 01:22:12,440
That Crystal woman
is coming over all the time.

1537
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:14,360
She doesn't even call first.

1538
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:16,840
Then she leaves stuff behind.

1539
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:19,120
A dress, a purse.

1540
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:21,840
I don't think
he even really likes her that much.

1541
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:23,880
He's just lonely.

1542
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:25,080
He misses you.

1543
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:29,480
Molly, I can't.

1544
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:30,840
I just can't.

1545
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:34,080
I know, I remember.

1546
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:37,320
I used to watch you get ready
to go out with Dad.

1547
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:41,760
And you'd let me put on your dresses
and your high heels...

1548
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:45,080
...and draw on some lipstick.

1549
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:47,000
I wanted to be you.

1550
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:54,120
I'm gonna go call Sylvie.

1551
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:17,800
Hey.

1552
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,720
- Hey.
- Mary.

1553
01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:22,320
I wanna know
what you're talking to my daughter about.

1554
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:24,280
I promised her I wouldn't discuss it.

1555
01:23:24,440 --> 01:23:27,240
She's having emotional problems,
now you decide to be discreet?

1556
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:29,000
I thought she needed a safe place.

1557
01:23:29,160 --> 01:23:32,680
I'm the safe place, okay?
That is my job, not yours.

1558
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:34,520
I'm the mother, not you.

1559
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:37,160
- She said she loves me.
- Yeah, you never have to say no.

1560
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:40,560
You show me the stretch marks,
and you can do all the mothering you want.

1561
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:43,880
And what is this, casual Friday?
It's Wednesday.

1562
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:45,480
Yeah, I know.

1563
01:23:45,680 --> 01:23:46,960
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

1564
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:49,840
- Something.
- Look, let's just drop it, okay?

1565
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,560
I didn't mean to cause problems.
I was just trying to help.

1566
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:55,160
Don't you ever get tired of saying that?

1567
01:23:58,520 --> 01:24:02,440
How dare you reprimand me for stepping in
where you should have been all along.

1568
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:05,160
You have not been there
for your daughter, Mary.

1569
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:06,840
You've not been there for anybody.

1570
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,200
You're not willing to face the hard stuff.

1571
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:11,520
Don't you criticize me.
Let me ask you something.

1572
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:14,800
Now that Molly trusts you,
are you gonna betray her like you did me?

1573
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,360
Do you have any idea
how hard it is to be your friend?

1574
01:24:17,560 --> 01:24:19,920
I tried to make it up to you.
What more do you want?

1575
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:22,800
I wanna know
how you can sell out your best friend.

1576
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:26,600
I hope that job is worth it, Sylvie,
because it's all you've got.

1577
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:27,960
I quit my job.

1578
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:30,120
- What?
- What else could I do?

1579
01:24:30,280 --> 01:24:31,920
I was making terrible compromises.

1580
01:24:32,120 --> 01:24:33,720
I can't believe you quit.

1581
01:24:33,880 --> 01:24:38,320
How could I be so out of whack
that I sold out my best friend?

1582
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:42,280
You were in an impossible situation.
Of course you'd wanna keep your job.

1583
01:24:42,440 --> 01:24:44,560
It's what you do, and you're great at it.

1584
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:47,120
It's nothing compared
to being responsible for a child.

1585
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:50,000
- I don't know how you do it.
- Come on, I'm a terrible mother.

1586
01:24:50,160 --> 01:24:51,920
Look what I'm passing down
from my own.

1587
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:54,280
I can't even talk to my own daughter
about sex.

1588
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:57,680
Well, it's easy for me.
I wasn't there changing her diapers.

1589
01:24:57,840 --> 01:24:59,720
- I mean...
- I know, you are helping me out.

1590
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:02,360
You're doing me a really big favor.
Thank you very much.

1591
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:05,000
Goddamn it. Thank you.

1592
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:07,680
Anything I can do.

1593
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:10,000
You have a huge job, huge.

1594
01:25:10,160 --> 01:25:11,920
I'm so glad I never had children.

1595
01:25:12,120 --> 01:25:14,680
That's the last impermissible thing
you can say at a party.

1596
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:16,120
That you don't want children.

1597
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:19,400
Well, I'm gonna have a dinner party
and then you can say that.

1598
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:22,760
Oh, my God, I'm exhausted.

1599
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:26,320
We're a mess.

1600
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:29,880
I like your hair, though.

1601
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:46,280
You know what?
I got my divorce papers today.

1602
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:47,480
Oh.

1603
01:25:47,640 --> 01:25:52,720
All I have to do is sign,
and I can't seem to be able to find a pen.

1604
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:55,440
Mary, look, it's the 21 st century.

1605
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:58,200
It's okay for people
to fight for their relationships.

1606
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:01,520
You know what this feels like?

1607
01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:04,680
It feels like
that phantom limb syndrome.

1608
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:08,560
You know that thing where you lose a part
of your body, like an arm or something...

1609
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:11,760
...but you still have the sensation
that it's there.

1610
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:14,280
Well, you know,
I'm sure Stephen feels the same way.

1611
01:26:14,440 --> 01:26:16,920
Oh, no,
I'm not talking about Stephen and me.

1612
01:26:17,080 --> 01:26:19,840
I'm talking about you and me.

1613
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:32,760
Fan out.

1614
01:26:42,240 --> 01:26:43,720
Hi, remember me?

1615
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:45,760
Oh, Mrs. Haines.
- My nails are a mess.

1616
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:48,320
But why wouldn't they be,
with what I've been through?

1617
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:49,840
- Do you have time?
- No problem.

1618
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,360
It's the least I could do.

1619
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:53,840
- Mary?
Sylvie.

1620
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,080
Oh, hi, how have you been?

1621
01:26:56,480 --> 01:27:00,040
Oh, fantastic.
I just had the most fabulous facial.

1622
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:02,480
So how's it going with you-know-who?

1623
01:27:02,680 --> 01:27:06,320
Oh, absolutely fantastic,
like we never skipped a beat.

1624
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:08,720
And the sex is just off the charts.

1625
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:10,360
I am so jealous.

1626
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:13,480
It's the whole sneaking-around thing
that gives it its yummy edge.

1627
01:27:13,640 --> 01:27:16,640
There's nothing like having an affair
with your estranged husband...

1628
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:18,840
...to put the spark back in things.

1629
01:27:19,480 --> 01:27:20,680
- Oh.
- Oops.

1630
01:27:20,840 --> 01:27:23,240
Oh, my God, I'm such an idiot.

1631
01:27:24,120 --> 01:27:26,440
I better go,
before I put my foot in it again.

1632
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:27,720
Great seeing you, Mary.

1633
01:27:27,880 --> 01:27:29,920
- Call me, okay?
Sure.

1634
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:32,880
Well, that was awkward.
You don't still see Crystal, do you?

1635
01:27:33,400 --> 01:27:35,120
You have to forget what you just heard.

1636
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:37,200
My life's been complicated enough
this year.

1637
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:39,440
It's all safe with me.

1638
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:41,520
- Now, have you decided on a color?
- Yes.

1639
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:44,560
Jungle Red.

1640
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:52,200
Are you sure, Tanya?

1641
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:55,240
Oh, God, I can't believe he's seeing her
behind my back.

1642
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:57,480
I'm practically living with the man.

1643
01:27:57,640 --> 01:27:59,880
Doesn't anybody respect rules anymore?

1644
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:03,360
My father's taking me home now.

1645
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:06,080
God almighty, you scared me.

1646
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:07,280
I gotta go.

1647
01:28:07,480 --> 01:28:10,840
He said I should say good night.
- Oh, well, come give me a little kiss.

1648
01:28:11,680 --> 01:28:12,960
- That's okay.
- Oh, come on.

1649
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:15,200
We just spent
the whole weekend together.

1650
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:17,320
It's hot in here and I have my coat on.

1651
01:28:18,160 --> 01:28:20,280
All right. Well, good night.

1652
01:28:20,440 --> 01:28:22,120
- Good night.
Uh...

1653
01:28:22,280 --> 01:28:25,160
Good night, who?

1654
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:30,160
- I asked you to call me Aunt Crystal.
- I don't want to.

1655
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:33,440
Hey, you know, I have bent over backwards
to be nice to you.

1656
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:36,480
I fixed up your room,
I made you that amazing dinner.

1657
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:38,960
Who screws up macaroni and cheese?

1658
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:42,000
That's not the point.
The point is that I make an effort.

1659
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:44,520
Why don't you make an effort?
What's your problem?

1660
01:28:44,680 --> 01:28:46,320
I don't like you.

1661
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:50,640
Come on.
What kind of stupid answer is that?

1662
01:28:50,840 --> 01:28:52,240
Everybody likes me.

1663
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:56,040
What would your father say
if he heard you talking to me like this?

1664
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:57,520
I don't think he cares.

1665
01:28:57,720 --> 01:28:59,800
Why, what'd you hear? What'd he say?

1666
01:29:00,720 --> 01:29:01,880
Nothing.

1667
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:05,920
Oh, by the way,
I won't be here next Friday.

1668
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:08,760
My mother's having a fashion show.

1669
01:29:08,920 --> 01:29:12,440
Yeah, it's something she's always
wanted to do, and now she's doing it.

1670
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:14,800
My father thinks it's great.

1671
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:19,640
He finds the whole thing
kind of sexy, in a way.

1672
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:22,720
You know, a woman
coming into her own and all that.

1673
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:26,120
At least that's what I heard him say.

1674
01:29:26,280 --> 01:29:29,040
Well, enjoy your bath.

1675
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:35,920
Stephen!

1676
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:48,440
I don't know what they do in your country,
but you don't throw the tinsel in clumps.

1677
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:50,120
We place it. We place it.

1678
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:52,240
Okay, I'm ready to go.

1679
01:29:52,440 --> 01:29:54,280
Oh, my God.

1680
01:29:54,440 --> 01:29:56,280
This is it, the big day.

1681
01:29:56,440 --> 01:29:57,480
Look at you.

1682
01:29:57,640 --> 01:30:00,440
I don't know how you are
so calm and collected.

1683
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:03,000
- You must be freaking out inside.
- Uta.

1684
01:30:03,160 --> 01:30:06,000
No, I'm really okay.
I always imagined myself doing this.

1685
01:30:06,160 --> 01:30:08,200
I guess I just stood in my own way,
you know?

1686
01:30:08,360 --> 01:30:09,760
Listen, kiddo.

1687
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:12,360
It doesn't matter what happens tonight.

1688
01:30:12,520 --> 01:30:15,200
What counts is that you showed up.

1689
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:18,240
I always knew
there was someone else inside of you.

1690
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:20,480
Thank you, Maggie.

1691
01:30:20,640 --> 01:30:21,800
You know, I just love you.

1692
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,280
Okay. Here I go.

1693
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:36,880
I'm going.
And, Uta, you'll drop Molly in an hour.

1694
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:39,840
- Yup.
- All right.

1695
01:30:41,560 --> 01:30:43,760
Maggie, can it be?

1696
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:45,760
Are you involved?

1697
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:46,920
Oh, shut up.

1698
01:30:47,080 --> 01:30:48,920
Here, decorate.

1699
01:31:08,920 --> 01:31:11,560
You should be on the Discovery Channel.

1700
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:24,280
It's got too much blue.
We gotta get her a different...

1701
01:31:24,440 --> 01:31:26,040
I see that. Just give me a second.

1702
01:31:26,200 --> 01:31:27,440
All right.

1703
01:31:27,880 --> 01:31:29,480
- Mary.
- Hey.

1704
01:31:29,640 --> 01:31:32,800
- Excuse me just a second.
- Mom, can you believe the turnout?

1705
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:36,080
All the best boutiques are here.
If I throw up, will you hold my hair?

1706
01:31:36,240 --> 01:31:37,640
It's going to be great.

1707
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:39,760
By the way,
your father stopped by earlier...

1708
01:31:39,960 --> 01:31:43,000
...and said to tell you
he didn't think you had this kind of talent.

1709
01:31:43,160 --> 01:31:46,320
- Fantastic.
- Don't be bitter. It leads to Botox.

1710
01:31:46,520 --> 01:31:50,360
Listen, I'm not sure about
the opening sequence of the show.

1711
01:31:50,520 --> 01:31:53,200
And I think you need to reconsider
where you place the coats.

1712
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:55,400
Mom,
when you said you'd underwrite me...

1713
01:31:55,560 --> 01:31:57,960
...I didn't think it meant
that you'd be popping by...

1714
01:31:58,120 --> 01:32:00,240
...every five minutes
with helpful suggestions.

1715
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:02,080
But you said you'd value my input.

1716
01:32:02,240 --> 01:32:05,160
That's what you say when you take a lot
of money from someone, Mom.

1717
01:32:05,360 --> 01:32:07,640
Nobody ever means it.
Now, go find a seat.

1718
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:09,680
Just take a look at those coats again.

1719
01:32:11,960 --> 01:32:13,480
Skinny.

1720
01:32:13,640 --> 01:32:15,320
Don't bother Mary.
Okay.

1721
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:19,920
Hey. Oh, honey, what are these?

1722
01:32:20,120 --> 01:32:21,520
They just came.

1723
01:32:21,720 --> 01:32:22,680
They're from Dad.

1724
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:24,200
They're from Dad?

1725
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:26,960
Hey, hey. Fingers crossed for me, okay?

1726
01:32:27,400 --> 01:32:29,040
Okay.

1727
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:34,320
- Mom?
- Yeah.

1728
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:37,520
This is really cool.

1729
01:33:07,280 --> 01:33:08,880
Excuse me.

1730
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:11,120
Hi, Edie.

1731
01:33:12,280 --> 01:33:17,200
You look very rested, Catherine.

1732
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:10,960
<i>Thank you.</i>

1733
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:34,640
Oh, Mary, I am so proud of you.

1734
01:35:34,840 --> 01:35:36,520
Okay, Mom.

1735
01:35:37,120 --> 01:35:38,680
Everything was beautiful.

1736
01:35:38,840 --> 01:35:39,920
Okay, Mom.

1737
01:35:40,120 --> 01:35:42,640
I guess I'm just living a little vicariously.

1738
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:45,680
Maybe even jealous.
A little competitive.

1739
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:48,080
- Mom, more than I need to know.
- Okay.

1740
01:35:48,280 --> 01:35:49,640
I'll take Molly home.

1741
01:35:50,600 --> 01:35:52,200
Mary.

1742
01:35:52,360 --> 01:35:54,000
Mary.

1743
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,560
All right, tell it to me straight.
What did you think?

1744
01:35:57,720 --> 01:35:58,760
It was transforming.

1745
01:35:58,920 --> 01:36:02,320
But it doesn't matter what I think.
This is the lady whose opinion counts.

1746
01:36:02,520 --> 01:36:03,960
Glenda Hill, meet Mary Haines.

1747
01:36:04,120 --> 01:36:06,440
This is the head buyer
from Saks Fifth Avenue.

1748
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:08,520
Hello.
- Oh.

1749
01:36:08,920 --> 01:36:11,160
Wow, I didn't realize you were coming.

1750
01:36:11,320 --> 01:36:15,280
Well, I don't ordinarily crash fashion shows,
but Sylvie called me, insisted that I come.

1751
01:36:15,480 --> 01:36:18,360
Said I'd be missing something if I didn't,
and she was right.

1752
01:36:18,520 --> 01:36:19,960
Really? Really?

1753
01:36:20,120 --> 01:36:21,720
I don't know what to say.

1754
01:36:22,520 --> 01:36:26,280
It's a small collection,
but I find it fresh and forward.

1755
01:36:26,440 --> 01:36:29,880
I assume you'd be open to some changes
for the Saks customer.

1756
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:33,720
Hemline here, maybe a jacket there.

1757
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:35,800
Saks Fifth Avenue
is gonna order my clothes?

1758
01:36:36,640 --> 01:36:38,560
Well,
we'll start with the New York store...

1759
01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:43,680
...and if the clothes do well,
we'll expand to all 59 stores.

1760
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:46,320
And of course,
we need everything shipped by spring.

1761
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:48,760
Are you geared up for that?

1762
01:36:48,920 --> 01:36:51,560
I think she's a little shell-shocked.

1763
01:36:52,040 --> 01:36:55,400
- Would you mind if I think about it?
- Think about it?

1764
01:36:56,680 --> 01:36:59,560
Well, don't think too long.

1765
01:37:01,200 --> 01:37:03,600
What do you have to think?
- I have to think about it.

1766
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:05,240
- What is there to think about?
Mary.

1767
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:09,400
It was so amazing,
and we're so proud of you.

1768
01:37:09,560 --> 01:37:13,040
And I am so sorry that I won't be able
to stay longer to help you celebrate.

1769
01:37:13,200 --> 01:37:14,360
But my water just broke.

1770
01:37:16,440 --> 01:37:17,360
What?

1771
01:37:20,280 --> 01:37:22,280
- Are we in the right place?
- Are you all right?

1772
01:37:22,480 --> 01:37:24,560
- Hang in there.
- Here comes another contraction.

1773
01:37:24,760 --> 01:37:25,720
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, God.

1774
01:37:25,880 --> 01:37:28,200
The contractions
are only a couple of minutes apart.

1775
01:37:28,360 --> 01:37:30,560
Every baby comes faster
than the one before.

1776
01:37:30,720 --> 01:37:33,160
- My last one came in just two hours.
- It's okay.

1777
01:37:33,320 --> 01:37:35,080
Excuse me, our friend is having a baby.

1778
01:37:35,240 --> 01:37:37,560
We need a room now,
so we need you guys to hurry up.

1779
01:37:37,880 --> 01:37:40,280
- Does she have insurance?
- She doesn't need insurance.

1780
01:37:40,440 --> 01:37:42,640
Have four, get the fifth one free.
Get her a room.

1781
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:44,960
Oh, I feel another one coming. Ah!

1782
01:37:45,120 --> 01:37:46,800
- Another one.
- They're a minute apart.

1783
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:48,560
One minute? She's got a minute.

1784
01:37:48,720 --> 01:37:49,920
- She's got a minute.
Okay.

1785
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:53,080
I'll take you right to the delivery room.
And who's the birth coach?

1786
01:37:53,240 --> 01:37:55,120
- I am.
- Oh, no, no, I want Alex to do it.

1787
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:58,040
- What, me?
- I think it'll be a good experience for you.

1788
01:37:58,200 --> 01:37:59,960
Don't worry, I'll help you through it.

1789
01:38:00,200 --> 01:38:02,600
- Oh, oh.
- Oh, my God.

1790
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:04,240
This is gonna be a big baby.

1791
01:38:04,440 --> 01:38:06,520
Don't point that thing at me, Edie.
It's loaded.

1792
01:38:06,840 --> 01:38:08,400
Come on, honey. Come on.

1793
01:38:08,600 --> 01:38:10,000
Let's go.

1794
01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:14,080
Glenda Hill? She is an arbiter of taste.

1795
01:38:14,240 --> 01:38:16,280
She's a big deal.
Why didn't you jump on that?

1796
01:38:16,440 --> 01:38:19,560
- I don't think I want such a big order.
- You don't wanna be a success?

1797
01:38:19,720 --> 01:38:21,000
Depends on how you define it.

1798
01:38:21,160 --> 01:38:24,400
I mean, I would be very happy
with just a little boutique business.

1799
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:26,360
And I have a daughter
who really needs me.

1800
01:38:26,520 --> 01:38:28,680
Your daughter looked at you today
in a new way.

1801
01:38:28,840 --> 01:38:31,920
You gave her a mother who got something
for herself. That's important.

1802
01:38:32,080 --> 01:38:34,200
Remember when they said
we couldn't have it all?

1803
01:38:34,360 --> 01:38:36,600
We can have it all.
The question is, do we want it?

1804
01:38:36,760 --> 01:38:39,080
I don't want it all.
I just want a nice piece of it.

1805
01:38:39,240 --> 01:38:41,520
I don't want it all either,
because it's exhausting.

1806
01:38:41,680 --> 01:38:44,280
We can handle anything.
We'll be each other's wives.

1807
01:38:44,440 --> 01:38:46,560
Do you know how loveable you are,
Sylvie Fowler?

1808
01:38:46,720 --> 01:38:48,560
Do you have any idea
how loveable you are?

1809
01:38:48,720 --> 01:38:50,600
Funny you say that, because I met a guy.

1810
01:38:50,760 --> 01:38:52,200
- You met a guy?
- Yeah.

1811
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:54,640
I'm thinking of giving him
my real phone number.

1812
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:56,520
- How did it feel?
- Oh, I don't know.

1813
01:38:56,720 --> 01:38:59,120
- I think it was because...
- No, no, no.

1814
01:38:59,320 --> 01:39:01,360
No thinking. How did it feel?

1815
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:04,080
I felt like... I felt like...

1816
01:39:04,240 --> 01:39:06,800
I couldn't talk. I had butterflies.

1817
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:08,920
Like that time I found my dog
at the pound.

1818
01:39:09,080 --> 01:39:12,760
- Aw.
- We're very close. You better come inside.

1819
01:39:15,680 --> 01:39:18,120
I want my husband!

1820
01:39:18,320 --> 01:39:19,720
Where the hell is that schmuck?

1821
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:21,360
He's coming, for crying out loud!

1822
01:39:21,560 --> 01:39:24,280
You are not doing the breathing right.
What is so complicated?

1823
01:39:24,440 --> 01:39:25,720
It's like this:

1824
01:39:25,880 --> 01:39:27,880
Somebody get here
before her head spins off.

1825
01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:29,360
I've got your back.

1826
01:39:29,960 --> 01:39:31,800
It's okay.
- Hey, is that Jungle Red?

1827
01:39:32,440 --> 01:39:33,400
- Okay.
Nice.

1828
01:39:33,560 --> 01:39:35,560
Focus on my voice.
Focus right on my voice.

1829
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:36,760
Focus on my voice.

1830
01:39:36,920 --> 01:39:39,480
- Here comes another contraction.
Okay, now, Edie, use it.

1831
01:39:39,640 --> 01:39:42,800
Use it, Edie, just use it.

1832
01:39:50,520 --> 01:39:53,520
I am never having sex again.
Sew me up right now.

1833
01:39:53,680 --> 01:39:56,680
Okay, so you got through that one, honey,
you got through that one.

1834
01:39:56,840 --> 01:39:58,840
- How's she doing?
- We're a couple pushes away.

1835
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,040
- This baby has a big head.
- Oh, can you see it?

1836
01:40:01,240 --> 01:40:02,760
Oh, God, it's the head.

1837
01:40:05,720 --> 01:40:06,760
Okay, okay, okay.

1838
01:40:10,280 --> 01:40:11,680
It's me, it's me.

1839
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:13,160
Hello. Stephen?

1840
01:40:13,320 --> 01:40:15,240
A strong one is coming.
- Mary, Mary.

1841
01:40:15,400 --> 01:40:16,800
Oh, okay. Hold on, okay.

1842
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:18,320
Edie, see that Christmas tree?

1843
01:40:18,520 --> 01:40:22,440
Just focus on that Christmas tree
and send all your pain right there.

1844
01:40:39,480 --> 01:40:41,400
That was a good one.

1845
01:40:41,560 --> 01:40:44,440
I'm not gonna make it. Oh, God.

1846
01:40:44,600 --> 01:40:46,440
Edie's having a baby.
Can I call you back?

1847
01:40:46,600 --> 01:40:48,160
No, don't hang up. Talk to him.

1848
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:50,120
- Alex, I just...!
- Oh, my God.

1849
01:40:50,280 --> 01:40:51,840
He wants to go on a date.
- Good.

1850
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,240
Good? I don't think
I can get past everything.

1851
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:56,680
You can get past it, just like Alan did.

1852
01:40:56,840 --> 01:40:58,480
- What? Whoa, back up.
- Come on.

1853
01:41:02,440 --> 01:41:04,560
Oh, don't look so shocked.

1854
01:41:04,720 --> 01:41:06,800
Five years ago. It just happened.

1855
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:08,760
When Alan found out,
it nearly killed him.

1856
01:41:08,920 --> 01:41:11,120
And that nearly killed me.
But he forgave me.

1857
01:41:11,320 --> 01:41:12,560
Not right away, but he did.

1858
01:41:12,720 --> 01:41:15,120
And you know why?
Because he's a good man.

1859
01:41:15,280 --> 01:41:16,360
He knew I loved him.

1860
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:18,360
And I love him and he loves me.

1861
01:41:18,520 --> 01:41:19,760
And we love the kids.

1862
01:41:19,960 --> 01:41:22,160
And now I'm gonna stop
because I am so exhausted...

1863
01:41:22,360 --> 01:41:24,240
...and I want this kid out of me
right now.

1864
01:41:24,400 --> 01:41:25,400
Get it out!

1865
01:41:26,680 --> 01:41:30,440
Okay, Stephen, here it is, here it is.
I'm gonna own up to my part in all this.

1866
01:41:30,640 --> 01:41:33,560
How could I share myself with you
if I had no idea who I was?

1867
01:41:33,720 --> 01:41:36,560
I want things now that I've put aside,
and I'm gonna get them...

1868
01:41:36,720 --> 01:41:40,400
...and anybody who is a part of my life
is gonna have to want those things for me.

1869
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:41,680
But this is gonna be hard.

1870
01:41:41,880 --> 01:41:44,400
This is hard work
because trust doesn't happen overnight.

1871
01:41:44,840 --> 01:41:49,120
And if you can accept all of that,
I will see you Tuesday at 8.

1872
01:41:49,280 --> 01:41:51,240
That's all I have available, I'm very busy.

1873
01:41:51,400 --> 01:41:53,200
- We're crowning.
- I gotta go.

1874
01:41:53,360 --> 01:41:54,320
Okay, ladies.

1875
01:41:54,520 --> 01:41:56,320
Get her shoulders, get her knees.

1876
01:41:56,480 --> 01:41:58,160
- Her shoulders and her knees.
- Okay.

1877
01:41:59,440 --> 01:42:01,800
- One more push, Edie.
Here we go.

1878
01:42:10,440 --> 01:42:11,880
Congratulations.

1879
01:42:13,080 --> 01:42:14,840
It's a boy.

1880
01:42:15,800 --> 01:42:18,600
Oh, my gosh, Edie.
You did it.

1881
01:42:19,400 --> 01:42:20,360
- You did it.
I did.

1882
01:42:22,200 --> 01:42:24,080
I did it.

1883
01:42:27,720 --> 01:42:30,240
Edie had a baby.

1884
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:36,480
So beautiful.

1885
01:42:36,640 --> 01:42:40,160
Look at you. You have a boy.

1886
01:42:50,640 --> 01:42:52,600
Oh, my goodness.

1887
01:42:53,800 --> 01:42:56,040
Hi, little boy.

1888
01:43:04,240 --> 01:43:06,640
- Hello, little baby.
- Sweet boy.

1889
01:48:42,480 --> 01:48:45,680
I think real beauty is real authenticity.

1890
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:47,640
And it's pretty much as simple as that.

1891
01:48:47,800 --> 01:48:50,320
I think a sense of humor
is really a beautiful thing.

1892
01:48:50,480 --> 01:48:55,600
People become beautiful
when you feel their confidence.

1893
01:48:55,760 --> 01:48:59,480
Because the beautiful thing about being
a woman is that we are so many things.

1894
01:48:59,640 --> 01:49:02,200
Honestly, it takes some cultivation
to know who you are...

1895
01:49:02,360 --> 01:49:05,760
...with all the mixed messages
and different kind of cultural demands...

1896
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:06,960
...of who you should be.

1897
01:49:07,120 --> 01:49:08,720
Be kind to yourself.

1898
01:49:08,880 --> 01:49:13,200
Because I promise you,
it will come and it will evolve...

1899
01:49:13,360 --> 01:49:17,360
...and you will see just how spectacular
your "differences" are.

1900
01:49:17,520 --> 01:49:19,880
Being a woman is a gift.
