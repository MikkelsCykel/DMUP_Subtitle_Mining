1
00:00:04,874 --> 00:00:06,842
Kup and Hot Rod just bought it.

2
00:00:07,042 --> 00:00:08,976
I can't deal with that now.

3
00:00:13,148 --> 00:00:14,250
Face it. Magnus.

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,413
The Decepticons are gonna dog us
until they see us dead.

5
00:00:17,987 --> 00:00:20,148
Then that's exactly what they're gonna see

6
00:00:20,523 --> 00:00:22,558
Prepare for emergency separation!

7
00:00:22,558 --> 00:00:23,726
That's too dangerous.

8
00:00:23,726 --> 00:00:24,954
What choice do we have?

9
00:00:54,857 --> 00:00:57,189
The Autobots have been terminated.

10
00:00:57,626 --> 00:00:58,650
Excellent!

11
00:00:58,994 --> 00:01:01,519
And the Matrix with them.

12
00:01:03,432 --> 00:01:07,061
Aaaaa! Unicron, why?

13
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,501
Take me to Unicron.

14
00:01:09,572 --> 00:01:10,869
Take me now!

15
00:01:25,754 --> 00:01:28,484
Did we have to
let them detonate 3 quarters of the ship?

16
00:01:29,024 --> 00:01:31,627
Seeing how
they would have detonated 4 quarters

17
00:01:31,627 --> 00:01:33,424
I think it was a good choice.

18
00:01:33,562 --> 00:01:35,757
But now how we are going to get there
in this wreck?

19
00:01:36,131 --> 00:01:39,259
Perceptor, can you locate a place
to set down for repairs?

20
00:01:39,335 --> 00:01:43,405
Gamma waves in this sector of space
create marginal navigation probabilities...

21
00:01:43,405 --> 00:01:44,235
however,

22
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,702
ahem, yes, I believe I can.

23
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:49,945
The planet of Junk is in this vicinity.

24
00:01:49,945 --> 00:01:51,435
Then lets go for it.

25
00:02:04,326 --> 00:02:05,258
Kup!

26
00:02:05,794 --> 00:02:06,624
Grimlock!

27
00:02:07,196 --> 00:02:08,094
Slag!

28
00:02:09,498 --> 00:02:10,624
Anybody?

29
00:02:29,151 --> 00:02:32,746
Hot Rod, Help me!

30
00:02:32,821 --> 00:02:33,685
Kup,

31
00:02:44,466 --> 00:02:45,660
Kup!

32
00:02:45,868 --> 00:02:46,698
Help...

33
00:03:31,313 --> 00:03:32,143
Kup,

34
00:03:34,149 --> 00:03:35,173
talk to me.

35
00:03:38,087 --> 00:03:39,714
Fix me.

36
00:03:40,389 --> 00:03:41,557
Sure, Kup,

37
00:03:41,557 --> 00:03:42,353
right away.

38
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,115
Brace for impact!

39
00:04:31,473 --> 00:04:32,633
Say something,

40
00:04:33,642 --> 00:04:34,700
anybody?

41
00:04:37,546 --> 00:04:40,743
Remind me to give the auto-pilot a raise.

42
00:04:40,983 --> 00:04:41,779
Daniel?

43
00:04:43,218 --> 00:04:44,981
I... I'm okay.

44
00:04:48,157 --> 00:04:50,250
Let's try to salvage this thing.

45
00:04:50,359 --> 00:04:51,451
Can I help, too?

46
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,621
It's rough out there, kid.

47
00:04:54,229 --> 00:04:57,323
I think Daniel can make himself useful
with this.

48
00:04:57,699 --> 00:04:59,268
It was Spike's exo-suit.

49
00:04:59,268 --> 00:05:00,633
Dad's exo-suit?

50
00:05:00,702 --> 00:05:02,037
He told me all about it.

51
00:05:02,037 --> 00:05:03,527
Here, try it on.

52
00:05:09,311 --> 00:05:10,335
Now try to walk.

53
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:11,878
Come on, you can do it.

54
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:24,191
Just think about what you want to do
before you do it.

55
00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:26,128
It's kind of tricky,

56
00:05:26,128 --> 00:05:27,425
woah, uh.

57
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:32,134
Keep on practicing,

58
00:05:32,134 --> 00:05:33,226
you'll get the hang of it.

59
00:05:33,268 --> 00:05:34,803
Come on, showtime's over.

60
00:05:34,803 --> 00:05:36,168
We've got work to do.

61
00:05:47,683 --> 00:05:50,880
This must be the junk capital
of the universe.

62
00:05:56,258 --> 00:05:57,459
Stop, thief!

63
00:05:57,459 --> 00:05:59,962
No welcome-wagon, "hello, stranger!"

64
00:05:59,962 --> 00:06:01,953
with that good coffee flavor for you.

65
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:04,828
Yeah, or your money back!

66
00:06:04,967 --> 00:06:06,730
Offer expires while you wait.

67
00:06:06,902 --> 00:06:09,029
Operators are standing by.

68
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:18,211
That does it.

69
00:06:18,947 --> 00:06:19,971
Well, what do you think?

70
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:32,394
Of all the circuit glitched diode
blowing dim wittery,

71
00:06:32,394 --> 00:06:34,055
you left a piece out.

72
00:06:34,096 --> 00:06:36,291
No way, you're just a little stiff.

73
00:06:36,732 --> 00:06:38,200
Anyway, all things considered

74
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,065
you did an amazing job, lad.

75
00:06:40,402 --> 00:06:41,528
Amazing.

76
00:06:41,837 --> 00:06:42,599
Really?

77
00:06:42,804 --> 00:06:43,472
Yeah,

78
00:06:43,472 --> 00:06:46,202
you even got rid of a nasty
burr on my rotator.

79
00:06:46,575 --> 00:06:48,143
Now let's find the Dinobots

80
00:06:48,143 --> 00:06:50,077
and get off this twisted planet.

81
00:07:08,497 --> 00:07:09,691
Don't act hostile.

82
00:07:09,798 --> 00:07:11,800
I'll use the universal greeting.

83
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,995
Universal greeting?

84
00:07:14,102 --> 00:07:16,866
Watch
I'll have them eating out of my hand.

85
00:07:17,406 --> 00:07:20,637
Bah weep graaaagnah wheep ni ni bong.

86
00:07:20,676 --> 00:07:23,543
Bah weep graaaagnah wheep ni ni bong?

87
00:07:23,578 --> 00:07:27,674
Bah weep graaaagnah wheep ni ni bong?

88
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:31,042
See
the universal greeting works everytime.

89
00:07:31,653 --> 00:07:33,883
Now, without making any sudden moves,

90
00:07:34,122 --> 00:07:35,783
offer them an energon goody.

91
00:07:39,061 --> 00:07:41,188
This is getting expensive.

92
00:07:41,363 --> 00:07:43,661
Don't worry, they'll reciprocate.

93
00:07:46,535 --> 00:07:49,163
I thought they
were supposed to reciprocate.

94
00:07:49,471 --> 00:07:50,733
No more.

95
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:54,637
Empty.

96
00:08:13,362 --> 00:08:17,355
Reminds me of the Niter slave mines
on Golgonath 7.

97
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:19,731
Everyplace reminds you of someplace else.

98
00:08:19,801 --> 00:08:20,936
Experience, lad,

99
00:08:20,936 --> 00:08:22,563
you should learn to appreciate it.

100
00:08:22,671 --> 00:08:24,434
Lot of good it's done us so far.

101
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:27,030
Hey, what's going on over there?

102
00:08:27,342 --> 00:08:31,870
Has the imperial magistrate
reached a verdict?

103
00:08:32,347 --> 00:08:33,780
I have.

104
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:37,212
Guilty or innocent?

105
00:08:37,319 --> 00:08:38,809
Innocent.

106
00:08:38,954 --> 00:08:41,650
Feed him to the Sharkticons.

107
00:08:44,626 --> 00:08:46,628
Aaaaaaaa!!!

108
00:08:46,628 --> 00:08:51,700
Hahahahahaha...

109
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,600
We've got to get a new travel agent.

110
00:08:53,835 --> 00:08:59,705
Bah weep graaaagnah wheep ni ni bong.

111
00:09:02,544 --> 00:09:04,136
What is this place?

112
00:09:05,747 --> 00:09:08,443
The world of the savage Sharkticons

113
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:11,576
and their cruel masters, the Quintessons.

114
00:09:11,753 --> 00:09:13,822
I am Kranix.

115
00:09:13,822 --> 00:09:16,825
My planet was destroyed by Unicron.

116
00:09:16,825 --> 00:09:17,826
Unicron?

117
00:09:17,826 --> 00:09:19,384
Who's Unicron?

118
00:09:19,428 --> 00:09:24,166
A planet that devours everything
in it's path.

119
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:26,100
So that's the monster's name.

120
00:09:29,671 --> 00:09:31,662
No, please!

121
00:09:32,107 --> 00:09:35,167
I'm the last survivor of Lithone!

122
00:09:36,011 --> 00:09:38,013
No! No!

123
00:09:38,013 --> 00:09:39,071
Let him go!

124
00:09:42,084 --> 00:09:45,884
Soon you two shall receive your sentence

125
00:09:46,488 --> 00:09:50,948
Has the imperial magistrate
reached a verdict?

126
00:09:51,026 --> 00:09:52,721
I have.

127
00:09:52,928 --> 00:09:56,198
Guilty or innocent?

128
00:09:56,198 --> 00:09:59,395
Spare me this mockery of justice.

129
00:10:00,001 --> 00:10:01,195
I repeat,

130
00:10:01,436 --> 00:10:04,564
guilty or innocent?

131
00:10:05,774 --> 00:10:07,207
Innocent.

132
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:09,868
Aaaaaaa!!!

133
00:10:20,222 --> 00:10:22,315
Not the end I'd wish for, lad.

134
00:10:33,768 --> 00:10:35,497
Me Swoop no see nothing.

135
00:10:35,737 --> 00:10:40,299
Me Grimlock positive Hot Rod and Kup close.

136
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:44,368
Me Slag say you full of Beryllium baloney.

137
00:10:47,048 --> 00:10:51,109
Me Grimlock say you full of Cesium salami.

138
00:10:51,186 --> 00:10:53,086
Beryllium balony!

139
00:10:54,156 --> 00:10:56,386
Friends find, look behind.

140
00:10:56,591 --> 00:10:57,990
Who say that?

141
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,668
Friends find, look behind.

142
00:11:07,836 --> 00:11:10,327
You go wrong way, you fool I say.

143
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:12,773
Me Grimlock fool?

144
00:11:12,974 --> 00:11:15,568
Picture you got, not fool you not.

145
00:11:17,045 --> 00:11:20,071
Me Grimlock no like you!

146
00:11:29,157 --> 00:11:32,251
Ow! Why boy hit my nose?

147
00:11:32,761 --> 00:11:34,820
Wheelie say, find friends today.

148
00:11:35,764 --> 00:11:38,392
Me Grimlock say, we on our way.

149
00:11:54,549 --> 00:11:55,948
Unicron,

150
00:11:56,151 --> 00:11:58,176
why did you torture me?

151
00:11:58,753 --> 00:12:00,414
You have failed.

152
00:12:00,455 --> 00:12:02,218
No, Unicron.

153
00:12:02,557 --> 00:12:04,991
Ultra Magnus is dead,

154
00:12:05,026 --> 00:12:07,324
and the Matrix destroyed.

155
00:12:07,729 --> 00:12:12,189
The Matrix has not been destroyed,

156
00:12:13,168 --> 00:12:15,398
and Ultra Magnus lives,

157
00:12:15,937 --> 00:12:17,461
on the planet of Junk.

158
00:12:18,406 --> 00:12:19,395
Stalk him,

159
00:12:20,275 --> 00:12:21,708
tear him apart,

160
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:26,074
and destroy the Matrix.

161
00:12:31,119 --> 00:12:33,747
Be sure the fittings are securely welded.

162
00:12:33,788 --> 00:12:36,416
AbsolutlyPositivelyDefinitly, IWouldn't
HaveltAnyOtherWay, AnyOtherWayAtAll.

163
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:39,559
Woah, this exo-suit's fantastic.

164
00:12:39,661 --> 00:12:41,595
I think I'm starting to get the hang of it.

165
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:47,961
Forward, avanti, apfel and like,
go for gusto...

166
00:12:49,771 --> 00:12:50,863
Hang on.

167
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,808
Decepticons!

168
00:12:54,876 --> 00:12:57,140
We've got to draw them off
and double back to the shuttle.

169
00:13:11,326 --> 00:13:12,793
There goes the shuttle.

170
00:13:19,834 --> 00:13:21,267
What do we do?

171
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:24,036
Transform, Transform, YouCanDolt,
IKnowYouCanDolT, YouCanDolt.

172
00:13:26,608 --> 00:13:28,041
Transform.

173
00:13:33,915 --> 00:13:35,815
Human germ.

174
00:13:36,084 --> 00:13:37,779
Transform.

175
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,022
There they are!

176
00:13:47,495 --> 00:13:48,723
Attack!

177
00:13:56,438 --> 00:13:57,706
Make a break for cover.

178
00:13:57,706 --> 00:13:59,901
I'll try
and unleash the power of the Matrix.

179
00:14:01,576 --> 00:14:03,271
Till all are one!

180
00:14:06,514 --> 00:14:07,913
Till all are one.

181
00:14:17,892 --> 00:14:20,258
Open! Damn it! Open!

182
00:14:23,365 --> 00:14:27,426
Prime, you said the Matrix
would light our darkest hour.

183
00:14:27,702 --> 00:14:29,033
Magnus,

184
00:14:29,537 --> 00:14:31,528
I want the Matrix.

185
00:14:31,606 --> 00:14:32,573
Never!

186
00:14:32,874 --> 00:14:34,865
Sweeps, terminate him!

187
00:14:41,316 --> 00:14:44,774
Die! Die!

188
00:14:48,123 --> 00:14:50,887
Unicron, my master,

189
00:14:51,493 --> 00:14:56,396
with this, I shall make you my slave.

190
00:15:00,068 --> 00:15:03,438
Before his imperial magistrate
delivers a verdict,

191
00:15:03,438 --> 00:15:06,032
would you like to beg for your lives?

192
00:15:06,207 --> 00:15:08,109
It sometimes helps,

193
00:15:08,109 --> 00:15:10,634
but not often.

194
00:15:11,079 --> 00:15:13,274
I can't transform.

195
00:15:13,581 --> 00:15:14,516
Keep trying.

196
00:15:14,516 --> 00:15:18,153
Silence or you will be
held in contempt of this court.

197
00:15:18,153 --> 00:15:20,986
I have nothing but contempt for this court.

198
00:15:21,022 --> 00:15:24,150
Guilty or innocent?

199
00:15:24,592 --> 00:15:25,581
Innocent.

200
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:35,403
They've got more Sharkticons
than we have photon charges.

201
00:15:35,403 --> 00:15:37,633
Then let's hold a demolition derby.

202
00:16:28,723 --> 00:16:32,694
Haha, didn't even bend a fender. Haha.

203
00:16:32,694 --> 00:16:37,097
Yeah, but look! There's a lot more of those
can digging, grill cracking things.

204
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:44,305
We can't hold out forever, Kup,

205
00:16:44,305 --> 00:16:47,297
but we can give them one humungous
repair bill.

206
00:17:06,327 --> 00:17:08,352
Execute them!

207
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:15,995
Excuse me.

208
00:17:20,241 --> 00:17:23,142
Me Grimlock want to munch metal.

209
00:17:47,135 --> 00:17:51,538
Haha, I never thought
I'd be so happy to see those bozo's.

210
00:17:51,739 --> 00:17:54,867
Me Grimlock no bozo, me king.

211
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:57,874
Sharkticons, execute them!

212
00:18:04,752 --> 00:18:07,687
Me Grimlock say execute them!

213
00:18:12,694 --> 00:18:16,926
I think the problems on this planet
will be solved very shortly.

214
00:18:17,165 --> 00:18:19,334
Yeah, but what about our probles?

215
00:18:19,334 --> 00:18:20,232
We need a ship.

216
00:18:20,501 --> 00:18:22,526
You get ship, if I get trip.

217
00:18:22,704 --> 00:18:23,693
Who are you?

218
00:18:23,771 --> 00:18:25,068
Him Wheelie,

219
00:18:25,673 --> 00:18:27,470
him freind.

220
00:18:27,642 --> 00:18:29,777
He'll be mine too if he can find a ship.

221
00:18:29,777 --> 00:18:32,075
Skip stare over there.

222
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,238
That's a ship?

223
00:18:35,249 --> 00:18:37,217
Who cares, as long as it flies.

224
00:18:48,096 --> 00:18:49,620
Ultra Magnus...

225
00:18:49,998 --> 00:18:52,831
WithoutTheMatrixTherelsNoHope,
NoHope, NoHopeAtAll.

226
00:18:53,434 --> 00:18:55,536
First Prime, now Ultra Magnus.

227
00:18:55,536 --> 00:18:56,468
What do we do?

228
00:18:58,806 --> 00:18:59,465
Look!

229
00:18:59,607 --> 00:19:02,076
Don't look behind door number 2, Monty.

230
00:19:02,076 --> 00:19:05,807
It's time to play
end of the line my valentine.

231
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:10,579
Geroni-roni-doo-ron-ron-i-mo!

232
00:19:43,017 --> 00:19:44,919
It's not hard to knock 'em down.

233
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:47,513
It's getting them to stay down
that's the trick.

234
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:50,425
They're indestructible.

235
00:19:50,425 --> 00:19:52,086
And they're everywhere.

236
00:19:56,731 --> 00:19:58,995
You check-in, but you don't check-out.

237
00:20:57,992 --> 00:20:59,594
Steady as she goes, Bob.

238
00:20:59,594 --> 00:21:02,230
Snoopy visitors get mud in the eye
by and by.

239
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:03,197
Film end.

240
00:21:10,171 --> 00:21:11,672
It's Hot Rod.

241
00:21:11,672 --> 00:21:13,697
And Kup and the Dinobots!

242
00:21:15,943 --> 00:21:18,579
Guns aren't exactly friendly.

243
00:21:18,579 --> 00:21:21,013
Neither are they incase you haven't noticed.

244
00:21:21,149 --> 00:21:23,317
What was that universal greeting again?

245
00:21:23,317 --> 00:21:24,841
Never mind, I remember.

246
00:21:25,286 --> 00:21:28,847
Bah weep graaaagnah wheep ni ni bong.

247
00:21:29,023 --> 00:21:32,288
Bah weep graaaagnah wheep ni ni bong?

248
00:21:32,493 --> 00:21:35,360
Bah weep graaaagnah wheep ni ni bong.

249
00:21:35,596 --> 00:21:38,699
Bah weep graaaagnah wheep ni ni bong.

250
00:21:38,699 --> 00:21:41,600
Bah weep graaaagnah wheep ni ni bong...

251
00:22:03,558 --> 00:22:06,994
Bah weep graaaagnah wheep ni ni bong...

252
00:22:06,994 --> 00:22:08,757
Me Grimlock not kisser, me Grimlock king.

253
00:22:10,898 --> 00:22:14,891
Have a nice day, and please close cover
before striking, friends!

254
00:22:15,036 --> 00:22:18,528
Breep drit
aw rootie! So say the Junkions.

255
00:22:18,906 --> 00:22:20,737
Where'd you learn to talk like that?

256
00:22:21,442 --> 00:22:22,340
TV.

257
00:22:22,543 --> 00:22:25,279
We talk TV. You talk some TV?

258
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:26,681
I talk some TV,

259
00:22:26,681 --> 00:22:29,450
and now the news, don't touch that dial.

260
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:33,054
Bah weep graaaagnah wheep ni ni bong...
By George kimosabes

261
00:22:33,054 --> 00:22:36,922
your smashed up friend soon like brand new
with ninety day warranty.

262
00:22:46,801 --> 00:22:48,325
Happy motoring,

263
00:22:48,469 --> 00:22:50,061
Cock-a-doodle-do!

264
00:22:53,975 --> 00:22:55,340
Look, he's alive.

265
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:57,879
Unbelievable!

266
00:22:57,879 --> 00:23:00,074
Your all alive.

267
00:23:00,581 --> 00:23:02,071
The Matrix?

268
00:23:03,551 --> 00:23:04,711
It's gone.

269
00:23:05,253 --> 00:23:08,188
And with it all hope.

270
00:23:08,222 --> 00:23:09,052
No!

271
00:23:09,123 --> 00:23:10,556
Galvatron has it.

272
00:23:10,658 --> 00:23:12,455
Where's Galvatron? Where is he?

273
00:23:12,526 --> 00:23:14,892
And the answer is

274
00:23:15,496 --> 00:23:16,963
Unicron.

275
00:23:16,998 --> 00:23:19,296
Then we've got to destroy Unicron.

276
00:23:19,433 --> 00:23:22,003
Yes, friends, and now destroy Unicron,

277
00:23:22,003 --> 00:23:23,595
kill the grand poobah,

278
00:23:23,804 --> 00:23:28,376
eliminate even the toughest stains.

279
00:23:28,376 --> 00:23:30,444
No fuss, no muss
Hurry, hurry, hurry, sale must end,

280
00:23:30,444 --> 00:23:33,936
rush right on down and test drive
rightest model with no obligation.

281
00:23:34,882 --> 00:23:38,786
New improved Junkion
planet is sleek sexy import

282
00:23:38,786 --> 00:23:40,083
with turbo handling.

283
00:23:49,864 --> 00:23:52,099
Yeah! Destroy Unicron,

284
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:55,770
kill the grand poobah,

285
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:59,399
eliminate even the toughest stains...

286
00:24:11,585 --> 00:24:12,950
Unicron,

287
00:24:13,788 --> 00:24:16,257
Unicron, answer me!

288
00:24:16,257 --> 00:24:17,692
See this,

289
00:24:17,692 --> 00:24:19,260
the Matrix.

290
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:23,196
I now possess that which you most fear!

291
00:24:26,534 --> 00:24:28,135
You will do my bidding

292
00:24:28,135 --> 00:24:30,069
or taste my wrath.

293
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:38,911
You underestimate me, Galvatron.

294
00:25:27,661 --> 00:25:28,992
For a time,

295
00:25:30,364 --> 00:25:34,801
I considered sparing
you wretched little planet Cybertron.

296
00:25:35,503 --> 00:25:36,435
Now,

297
00:25:36,937 --> 00:25:40,873
you shall witness it's dismemberment.

298
00:25:40,908 --> 00:25:43,536
No!!!

299
00:25:51,452 --> 00:25:53,818
Decepticons, we're under attack!

300
00:25:54,055 --> 00:25:55,044
Scramble!

301
00:26:34,795 --> 00:26:36,695
I don't believe it!

302
00:26:36,764 --> 00:26:38,789
Doesn't this remind you of anything, Kup?

303
00:26:38,966 --> 00:26:39,591
Nope,

304
00:26:40,201 --> 00:26:42,635
never seen anything like it before.

305
00:26:42,937 --> 00:26:44,768
What happened to Moonbase 2?

306
00:26:45,639 --> 00:26:46,765
Where's my dad?

307
00:26:47,341 --> 00:26:48,899
That's what we're gonna find out.

308
00:26:56,650 --> 00:27:00,221
Patented enamel resists fire
rain and corrosion

309
00:27:00,221 --> 00:27:03,213
for up to 5 years
satisfaction guaranteed.

310
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:05,918
Or your money back!

311
00:27:32,686 --> 00:27:33,754
Where's Hot Rod?

312
00:27:33,754 --> 00:27:34,618
I don't know,

313
00:27:35,222 --> 00:27:37,053
but I hope they didn't get him.

314
00:27:38,826 --> 00:27:39,952
Quick, this way.

315
00:28:19,233 --> 00:28:20,393
The Matrix!

316
00:28:20,834 --> 00:28:22,699
It will do you no good, Autobot.

317
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:24,294
It cannot be opened.

318
00:28:24,705 --> 00:28:26,832
Not by a Decepticon!

319
00:28:27,141 --> 00:28:29,843
Like it or not, we are allies now,

320
00:28:29,843 --> 00:28:31,367
against a common foe.

321
00:28:33,781 --> 00:28:36,875
Destroy him, Galvatron, now!

322
00:28:37,551 --> 00:28:40,315
Or you yourself will be obliterated.

323
00:28:40,387 --> 00:28:42,582
Of course, my master.

324
00:28:58,138 --> 00:28:59,730
Puny Autobot,

325
00:28:59,974 --> 00:29:02,966
you lack even Primes courage.

326
00:29:18,325 --> 00:29:20,623
Me Grimlock kick butt.!

327
00:29:38,846 --> 00:29:42,247
Me Grimlock need new strategy.

328
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:53,718
Help!

329
00:29:54,128 --> 00:29:54,924
Help!

330
00:29:55,095 --> 00:29:56,062
Daniel!

331
00:30:17,017 --> 00:30:19,212
Arcee! Kup!

332
00:30:54,722 --> 00:30:55,711
Dad!

333
00:30:55,989 --> 00:30:57,149
Daniel!

334
00:30:57,424 --> 00:30:59,093
Dad, what can I do?

335
00:30:59,093 --> 00:31:01,186
Knock down the acid cover!

336
00:31:01,395 --> 00:31:02,293
How?

337
00:31:02,396 --> 00:31:03,727
Blast it, son!

338
00:31:03,864 --> 00:31:05,299
But I don't have a gun.

339
00:31:05,299 --> 00:31:07,164
Use your exo-suit.

340
00:31:10,237 --> 00:31:11,761
Hurry!

341
00:31:18,278 --> 00:31:19,836
Dad!

342
00:31:25,819 --> 00:31:26,945
Daniel!

343
00:31:27,554 --> 00:31:28,680
You did it!

344
00:31:28,989 --> 00:31:30,980
Yeah, I did it.

345
00:31:34,828 --> 00:31:36,557
Come out, Autobot,

346
00:31:37,164 --> 00:31:39,826
we all must die sometime.

347
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,934
Not today, Galvatron.

348
00:32:20,908 --> 00:32:24,674
I will crush you with my bare hands.

349
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:30,242
Die, Autobot!

350
00:32:46,266 --> 00:32:48,461
First Prime,

351
00:32:49,069 --> 00:32:51,037
then Ultra Magnus,

352
00:32:51,238 --> 00:32:53,570
and now you.

353
00:32:54,074 --> 00:32:57,510
It's a pity you Autobots die so easily,

354
00:32:57,778 --> 00:33:01,680
or I might have a sense of satisfaction now.

355
00:33:09,022 --> 00:33:11,582
Arise, Rodimus Prime.

356
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:14,183
Optimus...

357
00:33:16,096 --> 00:33:17,085
No!

358
00:33:26,273 --> 00:33:30,369
This is the end of the road, Galvatron.

359
00:33:50,697 --> 00:33:54,633
Now, light our darkest hour.

360
00:34:39,446 --> 00:34:40,811
Spike, Daniel!

361
00:34:41,181 --> 00:34:42,910
Springer, what's going on?

362
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:44,484
No time to answer that now,

363
00:34:44,484 --> 00:34:45,746
let's get outta here.

364
00:34:50,624 --> 00:34:51,283
Look!

365
00:34:57,097 --> 00:35:00,157
Autobots, transform and roll out.

366
00:35:05,772 --> 00:35:08,536
I knew you had potential, lad.

367
00:35:35,002 --> 00:35:36,094
Destiny...

368
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:37,537
You cannot

369
00:35:38,305 --> 00:35:39,499
destroy...

370
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:44,040
my destiny...

371
00:35:55,122 --> 00:35:59,092
Let this mark the end of the
Cybertronian wars

372
00:35:59,092 --> 00:36:03,552
as we march forward to a new age
of peace and happiness.

373
00:36:03,664 --> 00:36:05,222
Till all are one!

374
00:36:05,432 --> 00:36:07,423
Till all are one!

375
00:36:08,435 --> 00:36:10,403
Till all are one!

376
00:36:12,105 --> 00:36:13,732
Till all are one...

377
00:36:14,732 --> 00:36:24,732
