1
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,960
- Do you think they'll come, sir?
- They'll come, all right.

2
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,600
Here. Stamp those and mail them.

3
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,920
It's ringing.

4
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,880
Would you walk Myron the other way?
My leg looks like a tree in this fog.

5
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,400
Come on.

6
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,680
What a godforsaken spot to get lost.

7
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:06,720
It's true. I saw a much better spot
a few miles back.

8
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,120
Hello?

9
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,160
Good.
Tell them we're lost.

10
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,440
- The phone's dead.
- Why'd you say "hello"?

11
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,240
- I could've sworn-
- What?

12
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,800
- Sounded like somebody snipped the wire.
- Really?

13
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,320
What did it sound like?

14
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,000
Snip.

15
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,480
- Some fog, eh, Pop?
- I've already heard the weather report.

16
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,000
Drive, please.

17
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,200
It's as thick as pea soup.

18
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,200
Not a soul around for miles.

19
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,360
Know what I think?
Perfect place for a murder.

20
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:06,520
Conversation like television set
on honeymoon:

21
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,920
Unnecessary.

22
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,880
Where are we going, anyway, Pop?

23
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:48,760
Who is this Mr. Twain?
What'd he mean, "dinner and a murder"?

24
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,480
Questions like athlete's foot:

25
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,760
After a while, very irritating.

26
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,200
To stop car, please.

27
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,480
- What's wrong?
- Stop car, please.

28
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,560
To shut engine off, please.

29
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,640
Listen.

30
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,920
I don't hear nothing.
What do you hear?

31
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,640
- Double negative and dog.
- So it's a dog. So what?

32
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,320
If not mistaken...

33
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,040
...dog belong to Mr. Dick Charleston.

34
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,360
- Who's Dick Charleston?
- I am.

35
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,880
You don't happen to have seen
a little white- Wang!

36
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,320
A white Wang?

37
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,200
Sidney Wang! What are you
doing in this godforsaken spot?

38
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,120
No doubt, same as you.

39
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,640
Looking for bridge that lead
to home of host, Mr. Lionel Twain.

40
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,800
You too, huh?

41
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,880
Must be important to invite
two such detectives.

42
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,280
Excuse, please, to introduce
Japanese son, Willie.

43
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,040
Japanese?
But I thought-

44
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,720
Mrs. Wang and I
couldn't have children.

45
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,080
Willie: adopted number three son.

46
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,480
Careful on this road.
It's treacherous.

47
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,880
Treacherous road like fresh mushroom.
Must always-

48
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,440
Idiot! Not finish mushroom story.

49
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,160
You're idiot!

50
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:15,480
Sorry, but I see nothing.
This fog's as thick as bouillabaisse.

51
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,400
- Nuts!
- I beg your pardon?

52
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,920
Nuts, nuts! There are
no nuts in my chocolate!

53
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,680
You let that imbecile in the shop
give you raisins.

54
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,480
He didn't have any nuts.

55
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,280
- The man in the shop?
- That's the reason I took the raisins.

56
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,320
Never mind.

57
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,120
We'll soon be there for dinner.
Hot soup.

58
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,240
Something is not right
in all of this, huh?

59
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,200
I can feel it in my bones.

60
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,040
- In your what?
- In my bones.

61
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,040
Buns? You have buns?

62
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,560
You bought buns
and didn't tell me?

63
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,040
- Where are the buns?
- No, monsieur.

64
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,280
The bones in my body.

65
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,320
You shouldn't speak with an accent
when you know I'm hungry.

66
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,880
If you ask me, Sam,
this is a wild goose chase.

67
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,200
- Nobody asked you.
- Yes, they did.

68
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,960
You asked me back there
if I thought-

69
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,880
That was then. This is now.

70
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,240
Nobody knows
what tomorrow will be.

71
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,520
That's the way it is,
whether we like it or not.

72
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,360
Sam, I really worry
about you sometimes.

73
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,720
Cut the malarkey.
This trip is strictly business.

74
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:34,080
- What do you got on Twain?
- He was born in San Francisco in 1906.

75
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,200
His mother was Catholic,
father an Orthodox Jew.

76
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,520
They separated two hours
after the marriage.

77
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,400
- Any children?
- Yeah, one daughter, 32.

78
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,920
Her name's Irene,
but she goes by Rita.

79
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,840
Just like a dame.
Don't stop, angel. You're doing fine.

80
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,880
He was arrested in 1932
for selling pornographic bibles.

81
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,680
Charges were dropped when the
church didn't turn over the bibles.

82
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:01,640
There's nothing on him until '46
when he was picked up in El Paso...

83
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,360
...for smuggling a truckload
of rich, white Americans...

84
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,480
...into Mexico to pick melons.

85
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,960
He was sent to the state hospital
for mental observation.

86
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,240
I think we picked ourselves
a queer bird, angel. Anything else?

87
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,200
Yeah. Get this, Sam.

88
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,960
Twain has one interesting physical
characteristic. He has no pinkies.

89
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:27,040
No pinkies?
Twain's only got eight fingers?

90
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,120
No, no. He's got 10.
He just doesn't have any pinkies.

91
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,000
- You did your homework good.
- Thanks.

92
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,480
- Where'd you dig that up?
- I wrote Twain and asked.

93
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,480
Good thinking.

94
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:45,000
- What's the matter?
- Wouldn't you know, out of gas.

95
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:50,720
I saw a station
about five miles back, Sam.

96
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,760
I want you to know I'm gonna be
waiting for you, baby.

97
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,200
Here's the bridge, Pop.
Doesn't look safe to me.

98
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,200
One way to find out.
Drive across.

99
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,600
Aren't you gonna come with me?

100
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,720
Weight of two men
may be too much for bridge.

101
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,720
Then why do I get to drive?

102
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,640
Because I smart enough
to get out first.

103
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,680
I'm not gonna make it.
It's gonna collapse.

104
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:45,080
Not worry.
Father find other way to house.

105
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,800
I made it, Pop!
I made it!

106
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:03,240
Good! Good!
Now come back and get adopted father.

107
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,120
Look at invitation.
What number of house?

108
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,440
- Two-two...
- Correct.

109
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,040
2-2, Twain's house.

110
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,520
Continue.

111
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,040
- Did you see that?
- No.

112
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,240
Neither did I.

113
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,080
Stop! Do not move.

114
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,160
Something's wrong here.

115
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,440
- What is it?
- Do not ask questions. Do as I say.

116
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,320
When I tell you jump, you jump.

117
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,760
One, two, three...

118
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,120
...jump!

119
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,800
Holy Shanghai!

120
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,360
Nice counting.
But how'd you know?

121
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,840
Look on ground.

122
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,960
Even had correct shoe size.

123
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,080
Someone gone great trouble...

124
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,760
...to make welcome guests
not so welcome.

125
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,440
Ring bell, please.

126
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,440
Are you nuts?
Someone's trying to kill us.

127
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,600
Yes. Should make exciting weekend.
Ring, please.

128
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,960
I wish it was Monday morning.

129
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,480
Well, here goes.

130
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,680
They're killing someone in there!

131
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,800
- Calm yourself.
- Didn't you hear her scream?

132
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,480
No. You heard scream.

133
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,400
More experienced ear heard doorbell.

134
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,960
Listen again.

135
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:02,400
Mr. Twain has
macabre sense of humour, yeah?

136
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,120
Good evening.
We have been expecting you.

137
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:30,160
But in what condition?
Roof in need of repair.

138
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,400
Indeed. I'm afraid
the house is falling apart.

139
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,760
- May we come in, please?
- I'm sorry. I thought you were in.

140
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,000
You are Mr. and Mrs. Charleston?

141
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,760
Not quite.

142
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:48,200
I am Inspector Wang
of Catalina, please.

143
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,560
This adopted son, Willie.

144
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:55,280
I trust you had a pleasant journey
despite the storm?

145
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,280
Strange weather.

146
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:12,040
Storm only outside when inside.

147
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:16,040
That. That's just one
of Mr. Twain's little toys.

148
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,840
An electronic device.

149
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,560
Mr. Twain,
as you will soon discover...

150
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,200
...prefers his atmosphere murky.

151
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,160
- May I have your bags, sir?
- No, no.

152
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,560
Son will get bags.
That is why I adopted him.

153
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,240
Very good, sir.

154
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,640
One moment, please,
while I close the door.

155
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:42,080
Now, if you will follow me,
I will show you to your room.

156
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,920
Very large house.
No other servants?

157
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,760
I'm not sure.
I've never seen anyone.

158
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:05,640
Mr. Twain asked me to see
that you're made comfortable...

159
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,560
...and to say he'll
join you after dinner.

160
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,440
After dinner?
Host not have dinner with guests?

161
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,320
No. Mr. Twain prefers to eat out.

162
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:33,920
- Wait, please. What that?
- That? It's nothing. Just the cat.

163
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,360
That cat?

164
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,280
You feed cat dog food?

165
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,920
I'm afraid he's
a very angry cat, sir.

166
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:46,720
Mr. Twain had him fixed,
and he didn't want to be.

167
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,000
Big house, huh, Pop?

168
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,160
Big house like man
married to fat woman:

169
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,160
Hard to get around.

170
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,760
Here we are.
I'm sure you'll find this suitable.

171
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,760
- It's a cold house.
- I've taken care of that.

172
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,920
You'll find a nice, cosy fire
in your room.

173
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,480
It's a bit smoky, sir.

174
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,040
I'm afraid that fireplace
hasn't been used in years.

175
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:34,920
- At least the bed will be warm.
- If you wish anything, please ring.

176
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:39,240
- Where buzzer?
- It's behind the bed, sir, there.

177
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,080
Dinner will be at 9:00...

178
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,200
...and Mr. Twain
likes his guests to dress.

179
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,640
The doorbell. Excuse me.

180
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,400
Wow! What a creepy guy.

181
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,480
Why would anyone want to hire
a blind butler?

182
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,600
For one thing, very cheap.

183
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:02,560
How butler know
how much he get paid?

184
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,160
Drink this. You'll feel better.

185
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,760
If Myron hadn't barked,
we'd have missed the statue falling.

186
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,520
It wasn't meant to kill.
It's a warning.

187
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,320
Somebody's trying
to frighten us. Why?

188
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,880
Whatever his reason,
he's doing well.

189
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:22,200
- Why hasn't anybody answered?
- Don't ring it! Knock, don't ring.

190
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,840
I won't, I promise.

191
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,920
- What is it now, Myron?
- Up there, Dora. Look.

192
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:39,760
- A blind butler.
- Don't let him park the car, Dickie.

193
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,920
Good evening.
We have been expecting you.

194
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:52,040
We let ourselves in.
Dick and Dora Charleston.

195
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,040
Good evening.
We have been expecting you.

196
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,320
Your room is ready,
if you'll just follow me, please.

197
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,040
Don't mind him. It's just the cat.

198
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:10,520
- We left our luggage in the trunk.
- I'll get it later...

199
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,160
...when I park the car.

200
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:20,160
- Was that Mr. Wang's car out front?
- Yes. They're resting in their room.

201
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,760
I've put you in the same wing
as Mr. Wang.

202
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:27,040
Isn't that nice?
We're in Wang's wing.

203
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,440
Not many people come
to the manor these days.

204
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,640
It's nice to hear guests again.

205
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,800
- Thanks. You are?
- Bensonmum.

206
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,320
Thank you, Benson.

207
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,440
Bensonmum.
My name is Bensonmum.

208
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,720
- Bensonmum?
- Yes, sir. Jamesir Bensonmum.

209
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,640
- Jamesir?
- Yes, sir.

210
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,960
- Jamesir Bensonmum?
- Yes, sir.

211
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,520
- How odd.
- My father's name, sir.

212
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,520
What was your father's name?

213
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,400
- Howard Bensonmum.
- Howard Bensonmum?

214
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,320
Leave it. I've had enough.

215
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,440
Here we are.
The late Mrs. Twain's room.

216
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,280
She died in here.

217
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,160
- Oh, dear.
- Died of what?

218
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,280
She murdered herself
in her sleep, sir.

219
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,360
- You mean suicide?
- Oh, no.

220
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,520
It was murder, all right.

221
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,440
Mrs. Twain hated herself.

222
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,880
We keep this room locked.

223
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:26,440
- Why is that?
- Mr. Twain loved her very much.

224
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:31,000
He's kept her room just as it was
the night she choked herself...

225
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,520
...nine years ago.

226
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,880
Madam loved it here.

227
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:47,800
She said it was
the cheeriest room in the house.

228
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:54,480
- The doorbell.
- That was Mrs. Charleston.

229
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,880
- I thought she was here.
- I am.

230
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,680
I will not stay in this filthy room.

231
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,400
Very well, madam.
I'll attend to it during dinner.

232
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,560
- Thank you, Benson, sir.
- Mum!

233
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:09,040
- What?
- Bensonmum. Ma'am.

234
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,600
Baking flour.

235
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,320
- What?
- This dust is baking flour.

236
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,800
And these cobwebs- Candied sugar.

237
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,280
All placed here for the purpose
of frightening us.

238
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,480
And that mouse-
Obviously a mechanical toy.

239
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,120
- Silly.
- What is?

240
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,680
I am. It's real.

241
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,960
- Stop the car. We're here.
- That's why I stopped.

242
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,960
- Open my door.
- You have chocolate on your face.

243
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,000
The candy bar's on your face.

244
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:55,000
- Imbecile, that's my moustache!
- Lick it and see.

245
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,920
Wipe it off.
My hands are sticky.

246
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,280
Hold still, please.

247
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,400
Sloppy.

248
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,520
All in good time.

249
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,120
Yes?

250
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,720
Who's there?

251
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,440
Who's there, I say?

252
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,440
Filthy neighbourhood.

253
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,200
Didn't I say "jump"?

254
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,560
"Un, deux, trois, jump."
Why don't you listen?

255
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,360
- Leave me alone.
- Sloppy.

256
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,160
Who are you?

257
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:11,880
You must be the new kitchen maid.
I hope you can cook.

258
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,000
Answer me. Speak up.

259
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,320
What's that?
I can't hear you.

260
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,760
A little shy, are you?
Never mind.

261
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,440
There will be 10 for dinner.

262
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,760
Here is the menu.

263
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,320
Is that understood?
And dinner will be at 9:00.

264
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:53,560
When I want you, that bell on the wall
will ring three times.

265
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,840
All right. Get to work.

266
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,360
Operator.
I am saying, "Hello, hello."

267
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,680
- It's dead, sir.
- What?

268
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,680
Who is? Who are you?

269
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,160
The butler, sir.

270
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,480
The butler, eh?
I thought as much.

271
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:21,320
That phone has been out of order
for the past week, sir.

272
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,920
Is that a fact?

273
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:27,080
And I say that this wire
has been snipped not one hour ago...

274
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,360
...as you can plainly see.

275
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,040
What is your name?

276
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,320
Your little jest escapes me.

277
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,240
I am Monsieur Milo Perrier.

278
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,000
He was injured
by a falling gargoyle...

279
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,800
...while standing
in Chinese footprints.

280
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,040
We rang, a woman screamed...

281
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,280
...a mouse ran through the door.

282
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,160
As you can plainly see,
I miss nothing.

283
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,400
Since we can't call a doctor...

284
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:57,880
...I will need a cold compress
and hot chocolate, "n'est-ce pas?"

285
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:01,120
We don't have "n'est-ce pas," sir.
Just Hershey's.

286
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,920
I'll call the maid.

287
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:18,200
I'll fetch it for you myself, sir.

288
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:22,800
In the meantime, if you'll be
good enough to follow me to your room.

289
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,480
Get up. Get up.

290
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,520
There's something about him
I do not trust.

291
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:31,520
Notice how his eyes
never look at you.

292
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,520
He's blind, monsieur.

293
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,720
Nonsense.

294
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,360
There's the house now.

295
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,480
- What's the matter?
- My feet are killing me.

296
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:51,800
Why didn't you tell me we needed oil
before I went back for gas?

297
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,240
I gave you $50
and the gas was $5.00.

298
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,080
Maybe you'd come back. Maybe not.
I couldn't risk it.

299
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,920
- Don't you trust me, Sam?
- Trust you?

300
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:05,400
The last time that I trusted a dame
was in Paris in 1940.

301
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,840
She said she was going to get wine.

302
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,080
Two hours later,
the Germans marched into France.

303
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,120
I'm sorry, Sam.

304
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,880
Sorry nothing.
Give me my change.

305
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,520
Dinner will be at 9:00.

306
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,280
I'll have the maid
bring your chocolate.

307
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:29,040
- One moment, my good man.
- Sir?

308
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,960
Thank you. That will be all.

309
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:53,440
He's blind, all right.
Those were my funniest faces.

310
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,000
It's not exactly
the Copacabana, is it?

311
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:10,600
I don't feel good about this.
Maybe tonight your luck runs out.

312
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:14,360
Maybe so. There's a number
on the wall for all of us.

313
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:18,240
If tonight's the night
they pick mine, so be it.

314
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,720
After you, sweetheart.

315
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,400
- First, kiss me, Sam.
- I don't kiss.

316
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,080
Just this once, Sam.

317
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:30,400
I don't like kissing.
Now leave me alone.

318
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,560
My God!

319
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,720
- He's dead!
- I beg your pardon?

320
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:50,440
Sam Diamond is lying out there.
He's been crushed to death.

321
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,440
I'm going to faint.
Catch me.

322
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,120
Madam. Madam, where are you?

323
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,720
Hold it right there.
Freeze, blinky!

324
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,920
Get your hands up.
Turn your face to the wall.

325
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,960
All right, angel.
You can get up now.

326
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,680
Turn around, Jeeves.

327
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:19,240
Your concrete Christmas present came
two seconds early, no thanks to you.

328
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:22,280
I apologize for
any unfortunate mishap, sir.

329
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:26,440
- May I put my hands down?
- Don't test your luck, Shakespeare.

330
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,000
I got your invitation to dinner...

331
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:33,360
...but I didn't realize
I'd be the main course.

332
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,440
I had a kid brother
who got it the same way...

333
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,520
...working on a case like this
two years ago.

334
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:44,520
That boy would've been 63
on Tuesday.

335
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:50,120
For two cents, I'd take this-
Get him away from me! Get him away.

336
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:53,800
Get him away before I stuff him
like a tiger trophy...

337
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:57,200
...his limey pals
like to hang up on saloon walls.

338
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,160
Please.

339
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,080
He has a dreadful temper,
hasn't he?

340
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,880
9:00, time for dinner.

341
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,560
Is everything ready?

342
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,480
I don't smell anything.

343
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,120
Very light on the seasoning,
are you?

344
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:32,640
Put the soup in a tureen
and keep the squabs on low.

345
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,000
I'll serve cocktails.

346
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:40,040
When you hear the bell,
bring out the chilled asparagus...

347
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,480
...and turn up the flame
on the squabs.

348
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,440
Have you got that?

349
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,240
You didn't tell me how I look.

350
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,880
No different than always-
Ravishing.

351
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,920
- Do you love and adore me?
- I love and adore you.

352
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:15,000
- You have the best tush in high society.
- Years of horseback riding.

353
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,360
Getting to bottom of things?

354
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,960
- Ah, Wang. You remember-
- Of course.

355
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:23,200
- Nice to see you, Ah Wang.
- Always a pleasure.

356
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,440
What a beautiful gown.
Tell me where you got it.

357
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:31,560
This? This an old dress.
Had it for years.

358
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,400
Please to meet adopted son, Willie.

359
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:38,480
East meets West
in a most bizarre setting.

360
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,640
I didn't know you were invited.
You know Wang.

361
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,600
I had the pleasure
of dining in Shanghai...

362
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,360
...many years ago with Inspector Wang.

363
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,560
You remember. Yes.

364
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:56,280
You had "hong ching chu"
and I had "kow dung woo fong."

365
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,960
My wife, Dora. Inspector Perrier.

366
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:04,280
I'm sorry. Our room is so dusty.

367
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,760
My fault.
I should have blown first.

368
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:10,840
May I present my secretaire
and chauffeur Marcel Cassette.

369
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:16,200
- Recovered from your accident, Marcel?
- But how did you know?

370
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,040
From the way you bend.

371
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,880
Your right side
smashed in by a Citroen.

372
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,440
I detected a slight
metallic sound...

373
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,880
...so I think you have
an artificial hip. Steel?

374
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:30,560
Aluminum. You're as quick as ever,
Charleston.

375
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,320
And you, Charleston...

376
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,120
...did not approve of
Mrs. Charleston dying hair blond?

377
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,960
I beg your pardon?

378
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,080
Mrs. Charleston hair red.

379
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,520
You have blond hairs on shoulder.

380
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:49,840
That means she has dyed red hair
to blond then back again to red.

381
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,840
Or else you have been-

382
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:58,720
So sorry. Wang is wrong.
Shall we go to dinner, please?

383
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:09,280
- Boy, Pop, you sure put your-
- Shut Japanese mouth.

384
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,440
It must be ghastly
to have a hip removed.

385
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,360
- Does it hurt?
- Only in damp weather.

386
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:26,840
- Are you all right?
- Pay no attention. You'll spoil him.

387
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,480
Get up. Get up.

388
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,040
- As I was saying, Mr. Charleston-
- Hey, Pop.

389
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,000
A treacherous road
like fresh mushrooms-

390
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:43,360
I know. Dog stick tongue
out of picture.

391
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,240
Treacherous road
like fresh mushrooms.

392
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,160
He's a charming fellow.

393
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,360
African death mask.
Died in some tribal ritual.

394
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,840
Wonder where others are.

395
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,880
Others?

396
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,640
What others?

397
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:05,480
Invitation to dinner and murder
finally clear to Wang...

398
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:08,200
...with appearance
of Monsieur Perrier.

399
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:12,240
It's obvious that the world's
greatest detectives were invited.

400
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,960
Five of us, darling.
Three are here.

401
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,840
Two have not yet arrived.

402
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,680
- Miss Jessie Marbles of England.
- And-

403
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,440
Sam Diamond of San Francisco.

404
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,080
I know who you all are.

405
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:29,120
The lady in the dress is my secretary
and mistress, Tess Skeffington.

406
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:32,320
- Sam, don't.
- I'm sorry, sweetheart.

407
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,360
She doesn't like it
when I'm brutally honest.

408
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:38,400
Then again, we're all
in a brutal business.

409
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:42,800
Never considered murder
to be business, Mr. Diamond.

410
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,000
Is that right, Mr. Wang?

411
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:50,520
Maybe not for you, since you put your
money in vegetables in the late '30s.

412
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:53,800
Our friends don't know
that you own 50 percent...

413
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:57,880
...of the bean sprouts and the bamboo
shoots grown in China.

414
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,920
You can imagine how much
chicken chow mein...

415
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,240
...goes into his pot each year.

416
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,760
- Do I have the figures right?
- Right.

417
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,160
What does this have to do
with anything?

418
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,720
Or you, Mr. Perrier.

419
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,640
You work both sides
of the big drink.

420
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:17,240
Pretty good pickings,
solving crimes for barons...

421
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,120
...and putting your fees
into Swiss banks.

422
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,360
Three trips a year buys
a lot of hot chocolate.

423
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,800
See here, Diamond-

424
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:30,120
You see here, Mr. Charleston of
New York, Palm Beach and Beverly Hills.

425
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,600
Crime's a hobby to you, isn't it?

426
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:37,520
It's a game to wile away the time
while you wait for room service...

427
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:41,840
...while your wife's dough buys
martinis and your $300 suits.

428
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,520
That's nice, when all
you gotta do...

429
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:49,000
...is give your wife a grab now
and then and take the dog for a leak.

430
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:52,680
Sorry to shock you, but I never
went to finishing school.

431
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,600
My school is the streets...

432
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,760
...and the barrel of a revolver
is my teacher.

433
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,160
I get $50 a day in expenses
when I can get them, gentlemen.

434
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,160
I owe Miss Skeffington three years
back pay. Ain't that right?

435
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,480
- I don't care about the money.
- Neither do I.

436
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:13,200
If one of you would be
so kind as to give my friend...

437
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:17,520
...a glass of cheap white wine,
I'm going down to find the can.

438
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,480
I talk so much sometimes,
I forget to go.

439
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:26,320
Please excuse Sam.
He was shot in the head last week.

440
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,040
He shouldn't be
out of the hospital.

441
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,280
- I think he's damned honest.
- Dickie, language.

442
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:35,080
Miss Jessica Marbles and nurse.

443
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:47,800
Miss Marbles.
So we finally meet.

444
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:52,480
I've admired you ever since
I was tiny little detective.

445
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,400
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

446
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,880
I am Jessica Marbles.

447
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:01,800
This is Miss Withers, my nurse.
She's been with me 52 years.

448
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,640
I have to take care
of the poor dear now.

449
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:09,400
Are you all right, Miss Withers?
Do you want your medicine now?

450
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:22,480
She's off. I could use
a good, stiff shot, Mr. Charleston.

451
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,000
I believe booze, as you call it,
is your department.

452
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,360
- My pleasure, madam.
- Who's the old geezer?

453
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,920
Jessie, baby!

454
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:40,000
- You have a bullet hole in your back.
- You should see the other guy.

455
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,760
Quiet, please.

456
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,680
Observe strange sound.

457
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:53,840
My God, it's the face.
It's coming from the face.

458
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,920
He's going through
his final moments.

459
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:04,320
- What could it mean?
- It means dinner, sir. We have no gong.

460
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,920
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to make a toast.

461
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:19,040
Our host, Mr. Lionel Twain,
is indeed a most unique man.

462
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,440
One:
He's succeeded in gathering...

463
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:24,040
...the world's greatest detectives...

464
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,400
...to investigate a crime
not yet committed.

465
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,360
Two: He's set traps for us:

466
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,600
A bridge that almost collapses,
falling statues.

467
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,400
Does he mean to kill us?

468
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,320
Not yet. He could've done that
at any time.

469
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:41,000
He's merely trying to whet
our appetites for the game.

470
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:45,400
Three: Why five detectives
instead of one?

471
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:48,560
Because he intends
to take us all on...

472
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,040
...a feat that no criminal mind
has yet attempted.

473
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:55,080
Before this hellish
weekend begins...

474
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,640
...I propose that we toast...

475
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:01,000
...to either a most beguiling
and charming man...

476
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:04,640
...or to an insidious,
fiendish madman.

477
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,840
- Bottoms up.
- One moment.

478
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:12,000
Point four: Wine poisoned.

479
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:18,360
An ancient, tasteless, colourless
and odourless Oriental herb...

480
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:21,640
...that kills instantly.
Observe, please.

481
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,640
Great Scott, Mr. Wang.
You saved our lives.

482
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,400
Not quite, Mrs. Charleston.

483
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,600
Bon appetit.

484
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:44,960
Since Wang was the one who could
detect poison, only he was tested.

485
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,600
Point five:

486
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:50,680
Mr. Twain is both beguiling
and fiendish.

487
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,480
- Get a doctor, quick.
- No, no. It's all right.

488
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:02,000
My wine is not poisoned.
It was just a bad year.

489
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,600
Good work, Mr. Wang.

490
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:07,760
We must all be on our guard
through every course of the meal.

491
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,080
You're all forgetting one thing.

492
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,720
This makes the butler suspicious.
He poured the wine.

493
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:19,120
How would he know which
one to serve the poisoned glass to?

494
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,880
That's very simple.

495
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,640
Blind people have
a very keen sense of smell.

496
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,560
Since we're Anglo-Saxon
and Mr. Wang's son is Japanese...

497
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,800
...it wouldn't be hard
to sniff out the Chinaman.

498
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,480
See here.
That's a tacky thing to say.

499
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:36,040
It's a tacky world,
Mr. Charleston.

500
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,760
- Isn't that right, angel?
- That's right.

501
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,960
Quiet, please.
Butler approaches.

502
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:46,760
I apologize. I'm having
communication problems with the cook.

503
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,480
Who poured the wine?

504
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,520
Mr. Twain, sir.

505
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:53,680
It was left for me
in the refrigerator.

506
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:57,680
I was told to give Mr. Wang
the glass with the sticky stem.

507
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,440
And you didn't ask why?

508
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:02,280
I was lucky to find
the refrigerator.

509
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:05,840
- If I may serve the soup now?
- By all means.

510
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,240
Yes, I'm famished.

511
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,600
One moment.

512
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:37,400
- Where is the soup?
- In your dish, sir.

513
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,600
There is nothing in my dish
but my dish.

514
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:44,240
- I don't understand, sir.
- Here, take the spoon.

515
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,240
Taste it for yourself.

516
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,520
I see what you mean, sir.

517
00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:01,120
If you'll excuse me, I'd better
have a little talk with the cook.

518
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:07,120
Murder by starvation.
Maybe that's his game.

519
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,440
- What do you think?
- I don't know. Ask the moose.

520
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:13,720
He's been watching
since we came in.

521
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:20,760
Ten people for dinner,
and I'm serving them hot nothing!

522
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:23,120
You can't get good help today.

523
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:32,720
You're fired, you understand?
Fired!

524
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,640
I want you out,
do you hear? Out!

525
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,720
And stay out.

526
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,520
Something just occurred to me.

527
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:49,080
- The seating's all wrong.
- How so?

528
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,760
- I'm sitting next to Dora.
- So what?

529
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,760
- She's your wife.
- Exactly.

530
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,080
The husband's never seated
next to the wife.

531
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:00,600
I should be on the opposite side.
Will you trade?

532
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:03,240
- Now, Mr. Charleston?
- Now, Mr. Wang.

533
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:09,400
Another test that could
have cost us our lives.

534
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:12,360
Saved only by the fact
that I am well-bred.

535
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:16,000
Lucky it wasn't me.
I'd have been chopped liver.

536
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:24,360
Silence, please. Do not panic.
No person move from place.

537
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,920
Someone just came in.
I hear footsteps.

538
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,520
Wait! Quiet, everyone!

539
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,120
- I smell something.
- What is it?

540
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:35,080
Good God! Franks and beans!

541
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:37,800
I'm afraid that's all we have,
sir.

542
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:40,520
You know how I get
when you touch me there.

543
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,600
My hands are in my pockets.

544
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:45,160
- They're my pockets.
- Sorry.

545
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,160
Dickie, behave yourself.

546
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:52,360
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

547
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,720
I'm your host, Lionel Twain.

548
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:11,520
Good God, what an entrance!

549
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:16,520
A bit theatrical, Miss Marbles,
but I do so love illusion.

550
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,320
Please forgive my hat.
I'm losing my hair.

551
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:22,640
I thought Twain was
an older man, say 72, 73.

552
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,360
Seventy-six to be exact,
Mr. Diamond.

553
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,800
How do I look so young?
Quite simple.

554
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:33,600
A complete vegetable diet,
12 hours' sleep a night...

555
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:36,560
...and lots and lots of makeup.

556
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:40,520
- I trust you're all comfortable.
- Comfortable, Mr. Twain?

557
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:44,440
Is that what you call poisoned wine
and near decapitation?

558
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:47,640
No. I call it inspiration.

559
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:52,520
You haven't explained the mechanical
and culinary attempts on our lives.

560
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:55,280
Merely games, Monsieur Perrier.

561
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,440
Pitting wits with you,
so to speak.

562
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:02,400
Pit your wits with me
and you won't have wits to pit with.

563
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,560
You're spitting on the nurse.

564
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:08,360
Sorry, old lady.
Crazy broad should be in bed.

565
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,680
We have been here four hours...

566
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:14,080
...and there hasn't been
a hot dinner or a corpse.

567
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:17,960
- I must therefore bid you adieu.
- I bid one adieu as well.

568
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:20,640
No one is leaving this house.

569
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,200
What meaning of this, Mr. Twain?

570
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:37,440
I will tell you, Mr. Wang,
if you can tell me...

571
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:40,840
...why one of the most brilliant
minds of the century...

572
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,240
...can't say prepositions
or articles.

573
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:46,400
"The," Mr. Wang.
"What is the meaning of this?"

574
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:50,000
That what I said.
What meaning of this?

575
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,920
The meaning of this is...

576
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:55,560
...that I have decided to prove,
beyond any doubt...

577
00:44:55,720 --> 00:45:00,640
...that the greatest criminologist in
the world is sitting at this table...

578
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,320
...and you are all looking at him.

579
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,640
No, don't look at each other!

580
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:09,320
Look at me! I'm the greatest!
I'm number one!

581
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:12,840
To me you look like number two.
Know what I mean?

582
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,240
- What does he mean?
- I'll tell you later. It's disgusting.

583
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:20,680
In all your adventures,
monsieurs and madames...

584
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:23,920
...none of you has ever had
an unsolved murder.

585
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:27,960
Your reputations exist
on this single fact.

586
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:33,560
But what would the world say
if the five greatest detectives...

587
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:39,000
...found themselves trapped
in a house, shut off from the world...

588
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:42,280
...only to discover
a dead body...

589
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:45,760
...stabbed 12 times in the back
with a knife...

590
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:51,240
...and not one of you able
to solve the crime?

591
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:53,760
- You mean murder?
- We're talking shop.

592
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,000
Yes, murder, Mrs. Charleston!

593
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,040
On the stroke of midnight...

594
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:01,320
...someone in this house
will be murdered.

595
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:05,080
Left out one small detail,
Mr. Twain.

596
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:08,160
Who victim?

597
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:10,720
"Is the." "Is the."

598
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:14,160
"Who is the victim?"
That drives me crazy!

599
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:17,640
- Sounds like a short ride to me.
- Does it?

600
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:22,720
Well, we shall see who is sane
and who is crazy around here.

601
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,640
Mr. Wang...

602
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:29,560
...the victim is here at this table
at this very moment...

603
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:34,040
...and so too, ladies and gentlemen,
is the murderer.

604
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:37,320
- Murder-poo?
- Yes, dear.

605
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:41,080
We're going to have
a lovely murder-poo.

606
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:44,840
Push her wheelchair down the driveway.
We got business.

607
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,800
- You know who's gonna get it?
- Intimately.

608
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:50,560
- And how it'll be committed?
- Definitely.

609
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,880
And what time
murder take place?

610
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,400
"The" murder. Precisely.

611
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:59,880
It's not my business, but doesn't
that mean you're the murderer?

612
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:03,320
No wives. I refuse to
discuss this with wives.

613
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:07,080
All fingers do point to you.
Not much of a challenge.

614
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:09,920
Shall I make it more interesting?

615
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:13,480
One million dollars
to the one who solves the crime.

616
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:16,200
Wagered against your reputations.

617
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:18,360
One million dollars, tax-free.

618
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:22,080
In addition, the paperback rights
and the film sale.

619
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,760
It's 11:00, amigos...

620
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:27,840
...just one hour before death
strikes someone in this room.

621
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,640
See you at midnight.

622
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:35,680
See here, Mr. Twain!

623
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:40,840
- He's gone!
- No, he's not. He's down there.

624
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,960
Fast little bunny, ain't you?

625
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:45,480
I've never moved, Mr. Diamond.

626
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:48,640
I'm still down there.
A stunt with mirrors.

627
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:52,600
Is that so?
Willing to risk seven years' bad luck?

628
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:54,440
Try it, Mr. Diamond.

629
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:56,680
It's your funeral, butterball.

630
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:00,880
Wait. Sometimes it doesn't work.

631
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:06,040
You've won this round,
Mr. Diamond.

632
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:08,560
My turn comes at midnight.

633
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,120
I hope he knows
how to stop that thing.

634
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:24,840
Anybody offering a million bucks to
solve a crime that ain't happened...

635
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,280
...has lost more upstairs than hair.

636
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,360
What do we do?
Sit and wait to be butchered?

637
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:32,280
And what has happened
to the butler?

638
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:35,920
Why has he not returned?
With our dinner?

639
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,240
- Go look for him.
- No!

640
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,840
- No one to leave this room.
- Why not?

641
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,160
Twain say victim at this table.

642
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:47,560
If we stay together, crime
cannot be committed without witnesses.

643
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:50,560
He's right.
You're one smart Chinaman.

644
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:56,480
Let's join hands. The chain's stronger
if the links are unbroken. Join hands.

645
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:09,640
Stop that.

646
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:15,560
- Stop it, I said.
- What is it, Diamond?

647
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:19,320
She's giving my palm the finger,
the dirty broad.

648
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:22,440
Naughty, naughty, Miss Withers.

649
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,440
- Good God!
- What?

650
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:30,440
Look!

651
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,600
- What's she doing?
- She's screaming.

652
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:39,600
- What's happened?
- Something wrong in kitchen.

653
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,800
- With our dinner!
- Patience.

654
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:44,520
- Is someone there?
- Someone with dinner?

655
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:47,440
Cook cannot speak or hear.

656
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:51,520
I think butler is dead.

657
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:54,800
My name is Yetta.
I don't work Thursdays.

658
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,760
Ask her if she sleeps in.

659
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:59,080
We'll investigate.
Someone must go.

660
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:02,240
Not alone. Mr. Charleston,
Mr. Diamond, stay.

661
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:06,480
Miss Marble, Mr. Perrier and Wang,
we'll investigate.

662
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:13,280
That's right,
just let it all out.

663
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:16,960
Here. Oh, dear.

664
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:21,400
Careful, Wang!
Fingerprints.

665
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:24,360
- Where?
- Yours.

666
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,640
Here, take my handkerchief.

667
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:41,440
- Is he-?
- He look like-

668
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:43,880
Seems like.

669
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:46,560
Touch nothing!
Fingerprints.

670
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,480
Quite so.

671
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,440
Pencil.

672
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:06,200
No pulse.

673
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:09,320
No heartbeat.

674
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:13,680
If condition does not change,
this man is dead.

675
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:16,040
No signs of foul play.

676
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:17,320
Hold on!

677
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:19,320
What's this?

678
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:23,040
What do you make of this, Perrier?

679
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:25,520
Poison, "n'est-ce pas?"

680
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:28,360
Not "n'est-ce pas." Cocoa.

681
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:30,760
So at last we have our murder.

682
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:34,760
Not quite. Twain say murder victim
sitting at our table.

683
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:36,720
Butler not at our table.

684
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:41,560
Butler only killed to divert us
from real murder still to come.

685
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:43,760
Look!

686
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:47,880
One of the knives is missing.
The butcher's knife, I'll wager.

687
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:51,080
- The others are in danger.
- What's exact time?

688
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:54,560
31 and 56 seconds.

689
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:57,640
Fifty-seven, fifty-eight-

690
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:00,320
Tell me when to stop. 59, 60-

691
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:03,960
28 minutes to main murder.
Back to dining room.

692
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:06,720
Must all be together at midnight.

693
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,520
One moment!

694
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:15,760
Handkerchief.

695
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,320
- What is it?
- A bill.

696
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:34,000
Everything here has been rented:
The butler, the food, the chairs.

697
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,040
- You mean-?
- Yes.

698
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:39,600
This entire murder
has been catered.

699
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:45,240
It's Twain's doing.
The man is mad.

700
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:48,680
Mad, yes, but no fool.
I only hope we are in time.

701
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:49,840
Door locked.

702
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,760
Diamond probably locked
it from the inside.

703
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:55,400
Good thinking on Diamond head.

704
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:58,720
Diamond, it's Perrier.
It's all right. Open up.

705
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,640
Diamond? Charleston?
Are you in there?

706
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:07,560
Go back to kitchen, get dining
room key from pocket of dead butler.

707
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:12,480
Don't say "dead butler." It's bad
enough I have to reach in his pocket.

708
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,080
Holy merde.

709
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,200
Miss Skeffington!

710
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:36,360
Miss Skeffington!
Miss Withers!

711
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:37,720
- He's gone.
- Who?

712
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:40,720
The butler's body is missing.
Here's the key.

713
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:43,160
- Where you find key?
- In his pocket.

714
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:45,000
- What pocket?
- The butler's.

715
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:47,800
- Butler gone, but pocket there?
- Exactly.

716
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:50,320
Someone stole him
but left his clothes.

717
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:53,600
Open the door.
Something is very wrong here.

718
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,960
Hello. Where is everyone?

719
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:04,840
Room filled with empty people.

720
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
I'll try the other door.

721
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,680
It's locked from the inside.

722
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:13,800
Both doors locked
from inside, yet no way out.

723
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:15,720
I don't like it one bit.

724
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:17,920
I like it,
but don't understand.

725
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:22,680
Maybe other way out of room,
secret passageway perhaps.

726
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:27,960
Wrong. There are no
secret passageways, Mr. Wang.

727
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:30,200
- You spoke?
- Not me.

728
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:32,160
I spoke.

729
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:36,720
There! Voice come from cow
on wall!

730
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:39,600
Moose! Moose, you imbecile!

731
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:43,200
What have you done
with the others, you short madman?

732
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:47,640
Stumped already.
Need some clues, Mr. Perrier?

733
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:52,200
I need no clues from you. I find my
own, you demented lollipop!

734
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:55,640
Man who argue with cow
is like train without wheels.

735
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:58,480
- Soon get nowhere.
- I'm sick of fortunes!

736
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:02,480
- Man who's sick of fortune-
- I said I was sick of this!

737
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:05,480
- Quiet, gentlemen, please!
- Cow talk again.

738
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:08,040
In need of a hint, Miss Marbles?

739
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:12,840
"You all mistake what you assume
"They never left the dining room"

740
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:17,120
"Count the numbers one to 10"
"Turn the knob and try again"

741
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:21,760
What does that mean,
they never left the room?!

742
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:24,680
- They did.
- Do not mistake what you assume.

743
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:26,760
- Back out in hall.
- What for?

744
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:31,240
We assume others not here,
but cow say they are in dining room.

745
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:33,200
Let us look once more.

746
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:38,040
Please close door, Mr. Perrier.

747
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,200
- I can't see what good-
- Quiet.

748
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:44,200
Seven, eight, nine, 10.

749
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:48,480
Miss Marbles, be so kind
as to open door.

750
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:56,680
Where were you?
We was worried.

751
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:58,720
Where were you?

752
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:01,200
Here. Didn't you say not to leave?

753
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:04,920
- You have not left this room since?
- Certainly not.

754
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:06,880
Answer simple...

755
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:09,560
...but question very hard.

756
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:12,880
- Where's the butler?
- Completely murdered.

757
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:16,360
Poisoned. One of
the butcher's knives is missing.

758
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:19,440
We came back here,
but the doors were locked.

759
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:23,720
I went to get the key from the butler.
His body was gone.

760
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:26,640
He'd been stripped
and his clothes left.

761
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:31,400
I don't understand. Why would anyone
want to steal a dead, naked body?

762
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:33,840
Well, dear,
there are people who-

763
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:39,080
That's tacky. That's really tacky.

764
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:41,200
Then we returned here...

765
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:44,160
...opened the door,
but the room was empty.

766
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:46,920
You were all gone.

767
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:51,800
The moose had told us not to assume
that you'd left the dining room.

768
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:55,720
So we counted to 10
and tried it again.

769
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:58,640
And here you were.

770
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:02,960
I'm not one to use hyperbole,
but I'll tell you this.

771
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:08,280
For the first time in my life,
I had the ca-ca scared out of me.

772
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:11,560
I like her.
I really like her.

773
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:15,400
- Gunshots, monsieur.
- Gunshots, Pop.

774
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:17,440
Gunshots, Dickie.

775
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:24,600
This time Charleston and I will go.
Everybody else stay here. Let's go.

776
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:31,760
What do you make
of all of this, Wang?

777
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,640
Is confusing.

778
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:41,080
"It"! "It" is confusing!
Say your goddamn pronouns!

779
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:48,720
Open the door.

780
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,600
- Good God!
- What is it?

781
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:52,960
He's back.

782
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:58,280
And au naturel.

783
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:02,920
I don't get it. First they steal
the body and leave the clothes.

784
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:06,440
Then they steal the clothes
and bring the body back.

785
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:10,200
- Who would do that?
- Possibly a deranged dry cleaner.

786
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:12,200
What about the gunshots?

787
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:15,080
Why shoot him
when he's been poisoned?

788
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:19,880
We heard shots, but I don't see bullet
holes. Not on his head or chest.

789
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:23,240
- Look all over him.
- All over his body?

790
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,640
Somebody has to.
I'm standing guard.

791
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:27,560
I'll stand guard. You look.

792
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:29,480
We'll take turns.

793
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:34,200
You look over the first dead
naked body, I'll look over the second.

794
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:38,960
Hurry up.
We only got eight minutes.

795
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:47,080
See anything?

796
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:50,400
No, I don't see
a bullet hole anywhere.

797
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:53,560
- Hold it. I see something.
- What is it?

798
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:56,040
Forget it.
Not a bullet hole.

799
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:58,920
If he wasn't plugged,
what about the shots?

800
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:01,160
- Divide and conquer.
- What?

801
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:02,480
Another diversion.

802
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:06,280
He gives us meaningless clues,
dangles red herrings...

803
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:08,680
...bedazzles us with banalities...

804
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:12,640
...while seconds tick away
towards the terrible murder.

805
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:16,680
You're good. Not my kind of cop,
but smart, and you smell good.

806
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:19,800
You're not a pansy,
but what the hell are you?

807
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:21,360
Classy, I suppose.

808
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:24,560
- Dames fall for a guy like you.
- I don't see-

809
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:26,680
Ever make it with a waitress?

810
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:29,760
A waitress.
Big, fat waitress.

811
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:32,320
I don't know about society dames...

812
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:36,480
...but you ain't had it till you
made it with a big waitress.

813
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:39,840
If you're ever interested,
you give me a call.

814
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:46,280
Bizarre little twit.

815
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:49,360
I'm still not sure about this guy.

816
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:58,640
- What are you doing?
- I have to wash-

817
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:00,560
I'll be out in a minute.

818
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:03,040
I'll go ahead.
I'll tell the others.

819
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:07,120
You're never gonna
believe this, folks.

820
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:09,040
All right, where are you?

821
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:12,320
What the hell is going on here?

822
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:15,040
Wash up later.
We got problems.

823
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:22,800
Locked from the inside.

824
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:27,720
That can only mean one thing...

825
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:30,080
...and I don't know what it is.

826
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:38,080
You're never gonna believe-

827
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:48,800
I'll be out in a minute.

828
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:59,520
I don't remember
closing that door.

829
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:07,520
What happened?

830
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:11,040
What were the gunshots?

831
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:16,360
Did anybody leave
since we were gone?

832
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:19,520
- It happened to you too.
- Where's my Dickie?

833
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:22,440
Sorry. Where's my husband?

834
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:25,800
Two minutes to midnight,
if anyone is interested.

835
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:28,000
It ain't possible, I say.

836
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:32,600
Eight people in a dining room
can't turn into an empty room unless-

837
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:35,840
- Unless what, Sam?
- Unless it never happened.

838
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,760
I see your point, Diamond.

839
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:41,160
When is a room with people
not a room with people?

840
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:43,960
- When it is two dining rooms.
- Exactly!

841
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:45,480
Two dining rooms?

842
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:49,480
Two dining rooms, two everything.
Twain electronic genius.

843
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:52,080
He's devised
a way to move the room...

844
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:54,760
...silently, in the flash of an eye...

845
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:57,640
...to be replaced by
an exact duplicate.

846
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:00,040
- I knew it all the time.
- Please.

847
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:02,760
I'll demonstrate.
I'll walk out the door...

848
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:07,800
...close it, knock three times, enter,
and you will all be gone. Observe.

849
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:17,160
I have it figured out.
There are two of everything.

850
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:19,400
Dickie, that's old news.

851
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:21,560
Everybody take their seats.

852
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:25,200
- I'm scared, Sam. Hold me.
- Hold yourself. I'm busy.

853
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:27,520
Take the same seats
from before.

854
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:31,000
Forty seconds!
I'm very worried about Mr. Perrier.

855
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:32,400
I'll look for him.

856
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:35,040
No. Sit, please.
No one to leave room.

857
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:38,360
The other door.

858
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:43,840
It's locked. I can't open it.

859
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,200
Hurry, man!
We have 15 seconds!

860
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:48,440
Move your hand, chauffeur.

861
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:53,800
Don't ask.

862
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:58,600
- Why are you wearing the butler's outfit?
- I said don't ask! I don't know.

863
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:00,800
It all happened too quickly.

864
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:05,320
The cook.
Where's the cook?

865
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:07,360
- She's gone.
- Never spoke.

866
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:11,360
Ten more seconds.
Quickly, sit and join hands.

867
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:16,760
Impossible for murder
to happen without witnesses.

868
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:20,800
Three... two... one!

869
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:50,680
It's over.

870
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:53,120
We're safe and sound.

871
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:59,320
That's probably the cook.
Come in.

872
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:00,960
The poor woman's deaf.

873
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:03,920
I'm sorry. I forgot.
Come in!

874
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:07,560
Not sound like cook to me.

875
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:24,320
Mr. Twain.

876
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:26,800
You appear to be wrong.

877
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:30,240
Nobody here murdered.
Please to come in.

878
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:37,320
Is he dead?

879
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:40,480
With that in him,
in the long run he's better off.

880
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:42,480
- Touch nothing!
- Stop that.

881
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:44,760
We're experienced
criminologists.

882
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:48,720
I find it insulting and redundant
to say "touch nothing."

883
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:51,080
- Quiet, woman.
- Up yours, fella.

884
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:55,640
Most amusing. Bickering detectives
like making giant lamb stew:

885
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:58,720
- Everything go to pot.
- Be quiet!

886
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:04,000
Shut up, all of youse!
Nobody move!

887
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:06,320
- Stay where you are!
- What is it?

888
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:10,400
I have to go to the can again.
I don't wanna miss nothing.

889
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:12,360
I'm going too, Sam.

890
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:18,160
I'd rather do this alone, Tess.
Thanks anyway.

891
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:22,680
The cook.

892
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:24,360
What, darling?

893
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:26,840
It's obvious.
The cook murdered him.

894
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,040
The butler's dead.
All of us were in this room.

895
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:33,520
No one could get in.
That leaves the cook. Right?

896
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:34,840
Wrong.

897
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,400
What makes you certain of this?

898
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:41,800
To drive a knife that far up a man's
back, you need a strong arm.

899
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:44,680
And this arm don't look
that strong to me.

900
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:49,080
- Is that her arm?
- It ain't the pussycat's tail.

901
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:51,800
Don't be alarmed, miss.
It ain't real.

902
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:54,920
For that matter,
neither is the cook.

903
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:59,320
I found this
before I got to the can.

904
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:03,840
Got a little surprise
for you folks.

905
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:09,400
- Look!
- A mannequin!

906
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:13,360
A dummy,
perfect in every detail...

907
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:17,280
...with the exception of not being
able to make her speak.

908
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:20,440
Hats off to the man
with the shiv in his back.

909
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:22,760
Except that he's dead,
he's no dope.

910
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:24,240
Nice going, Sam.

911
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:28,360
I hope you realize that
someone in this room is a murderer.

912
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:30,440
For sake of ladies present...

913
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:33,160
...may we return to drawing room?

914
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:35,480
My son will cover up Mr. Twain.

915
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:39,080
- Why do I do the work?
- Your mother not here to do it.

916
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:40,800
Come, please.

917
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:56,960
Excuse me.

918
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:08,320
I'm getting a headache. Isn't there
a way to turn off that machine?

919
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:11,640
Maybe some gadget
outside the window.

920
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:18,320
It's raining this time.

921
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:21,120
Let's get to business
and sort the facts.

922
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:23,560
It is now 12:30 Sunday morning.

923
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:26,320
The doors and windows
will open at dawn.

924
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:29,120
One of us will be
a million dollars richer...

925
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:32,240
...and one will go
to the gas chamber to hang.

926
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:36,680
One, Monsieur Perrier? Why not two?
We all have associates.

927
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:40,040
Why not six or eight?
I don't trust any of youse.

928
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:44,720
Maybe I'm a patsy set up for a fall,
but I'm not falling for youse.

929
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:45,960
Not even me?

930
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:50,280
Why don't you fall in love with
the Jap kid and get off my back?

931
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:52,720
Can we get back to case, please?

932
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:56,080
Time is late and my eyes
are getting tired.

933
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:59,440
- Thought they always looked like that.
- Knock it off!

934
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:03,720
Sorry. This case is getting
on my nerves. I'm sorry, slanty.

935
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:07,080
Thank you. Now then, facts,
please, facts.

936
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:12,040
Mr. Twain predicts murder. Predicts
victim to be at table, correct?

937
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:13,600
Correct.

938
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:15,880
This is official.
Correct.

939
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:20,520
Predicts murder to take place at
midnight and number of stab wounds.

940
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:24,040
How, if he not in collaboration
with murderer?

941
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:27,480
- What if Twain did it himself?
- Murdered himself?

942
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:30,920
For what possible reason?
And how?

943
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:33,520
The motive is simple: ego.

944
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:37,920
If we weren't to solve this,
he'd be the world's best detective.

945
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:42,440
With an ego like his, that he died
for it is a small price to pay.

946
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:46,520
Any man who can create
this chamber of electronic marvels...

947
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:51,280
...would be able to devise a machine
to stab him in the back 12 times.

948
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:53,840
That was wonderful.
I'm so proud.

949
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,520
- Let's go to bed, quickly.
- One moment.

950
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:59,280
Very interesting theory...

951
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:02,920
...but you overlook
one very important point.

952
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:05,480
- And that is?
- It's stupid.

953
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:09,000
It's most stupid theory
I ever heard!

954
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:12,640
- Do you have a better one?
- Yeah, much better one.

955
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:15,720
You see, I have been
doing my homework.

956
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:18,200
For example,
I have information...

957
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:21,160
...that your wife's
portfolio of stocks...

958
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:24,440
...was seriously depleted
in financial crisis.

959
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:29,360
In short, you are flat broke.
You've been borrowing for two years...

960
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:32,280
...at 17% interest
from Mr. Lionel Twain.

961
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:34,080
Broke? Is this true?

962
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:37,000
I was saving it for your birthday.

963
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:39,440
One million dollars would buy...

964
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:42,760
...great many tight suits,
would it not?

965
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:45,160
- See here, Wang-
- Dead broke?

966
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:48,440
Almost, darling.
I have $1.17 and some stamps.

967
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:51,800
But I didn't murder Twain.
You do believe that?

968
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:56,320
- We'll talk. We'll see.
- It could have been any one of you.

969
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:59,680
Each one of us was out
of that room at one time...

970
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:02,920
...giving ample opportunity
to commit the crime.

971
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:06,440
As for motives,
there's more than ego and cash.

972
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:08,200
For example, revenge.

973
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:10,280
Meaning what, Mr. Charleston?

974
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:14,520
I'm not the only one who's had
a past experience with Twain.

975
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:17,480
He was quite a ladies' man in his day.

976
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:19,720
Are you suggesting
someone here-

977
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:22,200
Was once in love
with Lionel Twain.

978
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:24,680
He was engaged to and jilted...

979
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:26,880
...Miss Jessica Marbles.

980
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:32,200
Jesus H. Christ!

981
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:34,600
Jilted 54 years ago at the altar.

982
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:37,440
Left her there
in that same tweed outfit.

983
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:41,160
- Is this true, Jessie?
- I was not jilted.

984
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:42,760
I walked out on him.

985
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:45,800
He wanted to fool around
before the wedding.

986
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:48,840
And being the lady you are,
you refused.

987
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:54,280
Not completely. But it got out of hand.
He was horrid, but I didn't kill him.

988
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:57,280
That's good enough for me.
What about you?

989
01:10:57,440 --> 01:11:00,640
I'm not a Frenchy!
I'm a Belgy!

990
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:05,320
And as for other motives,
how about patricide?

991
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:08,040
The killing of one's own parent?

992
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:12,520
You mean that Lionel Twain was
the father of someone in this room?

993
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:14,040
He wasn't my father.

994
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:18,280
He was my uncle.

995
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:20,360
He was very good to me.

996
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:23,720
He would take me to the circus
and give me candy.

997
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:27,840
We stopped going
when I was about 26.

998
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:31,120
I'm sorry, Sam.

999
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:34,120
Twenty-six?
What kind of a circus was it?

1000
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:38,400
Forgive me, but I was talking about
patricide, not uncle-cide.

1001
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:41,000
Twain may have been your uncle...

1002
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:44,040
...but he was the
illegitimate father of...

1003
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:46,680
...Monsieur Sidney Wang!

1004
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:50,680
It not true.

1005
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:53,880
I was adopted.
I have my papers.

1006
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:57,240
That is why I have adopted
all my children.

1007
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:59,080
I was wondering.

1008
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:02,480
He loved me very much...

1009
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:05,160
...but he was not very observant.

1010
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:10,280
One day when I was 19,
he called me to his study...

1011
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:14,440
...noticed for first time I was
Oriental, and kicked me out.

1012
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:16,840
- I could have-
- Killed him, Wang?

1013
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,320
As easily as you,
Monsieur Perrier.

1014
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:23,080
Lionel Twain killed
the only thing you ever loved:

1015
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:26,520
Marie-Louise Cartier.

1016
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:40,840
Your sweetheart?

1017
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:45,080
My poodle.

1018
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:49,320
He was a most cruel man.

1019
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:53,480
Monsieur would come to France
every season...

1020
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:56,680
...to hunt poodles.

1021
01:12:57,720 --> 01:12:59,320
The day they brought...

1022
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:02,680
...her bloodied collar to me,
I vowed I would-

1023
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:06,880
- Knock him off?
- Yes, gladly, if I had the chance.

1024
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:08,960
But I did not.

1025
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:11,080
Someone here beat me to it.

1026
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:14,760
There's more than one reason
that we was invited here.

1027
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:18,280
Not only was Twain testing
us as detectives...

1028
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:21,280
...but we all have motives
for doing him in.

1029
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:24,400
Have not yet heard
your motive, Mr. Diamond.

1030
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:27,040
My motive is unimportant.

1031
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:30,200
Let's say that I hated him enough
to kill him.

1032
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:35,240
You are closed man, Mr. Diamond.
You hide many things.

1033
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:39,400
Could it be that Mr. Twain
discover your secret?

1034
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:42,240
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1035
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:46,120
We know different,
do we not, Miss Skeffington?

1036
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:51,560
Twain picked up Sam in a gay bar.

1037
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:54,760
I was working on a case. Working.

1038
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:56,880
Every night for six months?

1039
01:13:57,040 --> 01:14:00,760
I got 50 bucks a day and expenses.
I hate them queeries.

1040
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:03,400
Twain...

1041
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:06,320
...had Polaroid pictures
of Sam in drag.

1042
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:10,280
I was in disguise.
Lots of dames go in those joints.

1043
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:12,160
I never kissed nobody.

1044
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:15,600
I never did nothing to a man
that I wouldn't do to a woman.

1045
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:18,400
And I didn't kill Twain.

1046
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:22,120
Bitch.

1047
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:24,200
Most interesting.

1048
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:28,280
All had perfect motives
for killing Twain.

1049
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:31,480
Wonder which one
was one who done it.

1050
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:34,960
We still have
the night to get through.

1051
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:39,480
If anyone's going to solve this,
I say we get a good night's sleep.

1052
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:42,120
And I suggest
we all lock our doors.

1053
01:14:42,280 --> 01:14:44,440
One of us is a mad killer...

1054
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:47,400
...and not to be trusted.

1055
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:32,560
Who do you think is the murderer?

1056
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:34,240
Must sleep on it.

1057
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:37,800
Will know in morning when wake up.

1058
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:40,040
What if you don't wake up?

1059
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:42,280
Then you did it.

1060
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:44,280
Go sleep, please.

1061
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:50,360
- Good night, Dad.
- Should have adopted pussycat.

1062
01:15:57,440 --> 01:16:00,040
Should I turn off the steam, Pop?

1063
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:03,640
Not steam.

1064
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:07,440
Someone just put
deadly snake in room.

1065
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:10,560
Wake me when it come near bed.

1066
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:17,000
I want you to know, Dickie,
if you're the murderer...

1067
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:18,760
...I'll still love you.

1068
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:22,840
It wouldn't be right for us
to make love, but I'd love you.

1069
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:26,480
No fear of that, pet.
Let's see what we have here.

1070
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:30,160
We have one missing, dead,
naked butler...

1071
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:33,000
...one host with
a knife in his back...

1072
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:35,960
...and one scorpion
crawling up our sheets.

1073
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:39,200
- Is that what that is?
- They can kill instantly.

1074
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:41,600
I suggest we don't move.

1075
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:43,760
For how long?

1076
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:46,960
Quite possibly
for the rest of our lives.

1077
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:53,960
Good heavens!
I know who the murderer is.

1078
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:55,440
Solvey-poo?

1079
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:59,400
Yes, Miss Withers.
The murderer is-

1080
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:00,840
Good God! Gas!

1081
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,480
I'm sorry. I can't help it.
I'm old.

1082
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:07,720
No, no. The other kind of gas.
The kind that kills.

1083
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:12,280
- Sometimes my gas-
- It's seeping in through the vent!

1084
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:23,320
It's locked from the outside.

1085
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:25,480
Help!

1086
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:28,800
Doesn't smell that bad to me.

1087
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:30,720
Help!

1088
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:46,760
Did I do right, Sam,
telling them about the gay bar?

1089
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:52,320
Perfect. They took the bait like a dumb
halibut. Let them think I'm a pansy.

1090
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:56,720
While they're suspecting me,
one of them will let his pants down.

1091
01:17:57,920 --> 01:18:02,480
Why do you keep all those naked
muscle men magazines in your office?

1092
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:05,640
Suspects.
Always looking for suspects.

1093
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:09,640
What's that ticking sound I hear?

1094
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:21,200
"That ticking sound is a bomb
that will go off in 30 seconds.

1095
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:23,480
- Signed, the murderer."
- The door!

1096
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:25,760
"P.S. The door is locked."

1097
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:35,240
I'm sorry about this, Tess.

1098
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:39,880
- Me owing you all that money too.
- That's all right. What will we do?

1099
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:41,600
I got an idea.

1100
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:44,840
I don't know if this will work.
Turn around!

1101
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:48,040
- I'm turned.
- Whatever you do, don't turn back.

1102
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:49,960
- If anything-
- Do as I say.

1103
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:55,320
- I will, Sam.
- Good. Because I think I'm gonna cry.

1104
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:12,840
- What are you doing in my bed?
- There's no place to sleep.

1105
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,080
Sleep in the car,
you chauffeur.

1106
01:19:15,240 --> 01:19:18,240
Unfair. I will tell everyone
you wear a toupee.

1107
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:21,000
- They already know.
- Why do you wear it?

1108
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:22,920
I didn't know you knew.

1109
01:19:23,080 --> 01:19:27,440
Certainly I know.
It's a terrible toupee.

1110
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:31,720
A bomb. Across the hall.

1111
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:33,920
Quickly, the door!

1112
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:41,800
It's locked from the outside.

1113
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:45,720
You look taller to me.
Why is that?

1114
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:48,240
Monsieur, I'm not getting taller.

1115
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:51,880
If you aren't getting taller,
there's one alternative.

1116
01:19:52,040 --> 01:19:54,400
The room is getting shorter!

1117
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:58,200
The ceiling is coming down!

1118
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:11,320
- What'll we do?
- I don't know!

1119
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:15,520
But this is exactly how
they make goose liver pate.

1120
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:48,200
Not so fast, please.

1121
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:50,760
Do not cross out Wang name.

1122
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:53,960
Cross out "snake" instead.

1123
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:58,600
Nice shot, Pop. Sure wish you
weren't such a heavy sleeper.

1124
01:20:58,760 --> 01:21:00,680
And now...

1125
01:21:00,840 --> 01:21:03,560
...if you please.

1126
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:05,680
One million dollars...

1127
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:08,200
...Mr. Bensonmum.

1128
01:21:08,360 --> 01:21:10,160
Banzai, Pop!

1129
01:21:11,240 --> 01:21:13,320
Very clever of you, Mr. Wang.

1130
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:17,680
Oh, yes.
As you can see, I can see.

1131
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:19,880
So I see.

1132
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:24,280
Tell me, as the only survivor,
how did you deduce it was me?

1133
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:29,320
Went back to theory
seldom used today:

1134
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:31,120
Butler did it.

1135
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:34,440
I hadn't thought of that.

1136
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:37,400
How do you account for
my dead body?

1137
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:42,280
Body made of plastic,
same as plastic cook.

1138
01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:45,520
While we examine plastic butler...

1139
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:47,760
...you murder Lionel Twain.

1140
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:51,400
You're a clever little
laundry man, Mr. Wang.

1141
01:21:51,560 --> 01:21:53,880
But not quite clever enough!

1142
01:21:54,040 --> 01:21:58,480
I'll take that one million dollars,
Bensonmum...

1143
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:00,560
...alias Irving Goldman.

1144
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:04,400
Irving Goldman?

1145
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:05,680
Yes.

1146
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:09,640
Irving Goldman was the attorney
of the late Lionel Twain.

1147
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:11,960
Lionel Twain died five years ago.

1148
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:15,960
His body was discovered
in Goldman's filing cabinet.

1149
01:22:16,120 --> 01:22:19,120
Am I correct, Mr. Goldman?

1150
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:22,320
Yeah. Correct, Miss Marbles.

1151
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:25,160
But how did you escape
the poison gas?

1152
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:27,560
Quite simple.
I covered my mouth...

1153
01:22:27,720 --> 01:22:31,320
...and let Miss Withers here
breathe in all the gas.

1154
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:34,560
- Sicky-poo.
- Yes, dear, I know.

1155
01:22:34,720 --> 01:22:38,120
- The million dollars, please.
- I wouldn't, Goldman.

1156
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:40,040
Or is it Goldman?

1157
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:42,840
Actually, it's Mr. Marvin Metzner.

1158
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:46,160
Marvin Metzner?

1159
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:50,480
Very good, Mr. Charleston.

1160
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:52,680
But how did you know?

1161
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:57,680
The bill in the dead butler's hand
stating the weekend had been catered.

1162
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:02,240
- Only an accountant would keep that.
- Get the money and let's go.

1163
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:04,960
Goldman died
last month while skiing.

1164
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:08,040
He jumped 200 feet
into a low-flying plane.

1165
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:09,840
I can't wait much longer.

1166
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:13,440
You've not lost your touch,
Mr. Charleston.

1167
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:16,520
But how did you elude
the deadly scorpion?

1168
01:23:16,680 --> 01:23:18,280
We didn't.
He stung Dora.

1169
01:23:18,440 --> 01:23:21,760
- We have 15 minutes to reach a doctor.
- Explain later.

1170
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:24,760
We'll make it. Never fear.
The prize money.

1171
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:27,080
Belongs to me, monsieur.

1172
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:30,560
Marcel, being one of
the world's strongest men...

1173
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:35,160
...stopped your ceiling from crushing
us at four feet, five inches.

1174
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:39,000
It may be months before
we're able to straighten again...

1175
01:23:39,160 --> 01:23:43,560
...but a million dollars
will buy a lot of back braces.

1176
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:47,720
Eh, Miss Irene Twain?

1177
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:49,720
Daughter of Lionel!

1178
01:23:49,880 --> 01:23:51,640
What?

1179
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:55,920
I prefer to be called Rita.

1180
01:23:57,960 --> 01:23:59,440
But how did you know?

1181
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:03,600
Never underestimate
a Frenchman's nostrils, Miss Twain.

1182
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:05,560
At dinner tonight...

1183
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:08,280
...I smelled your Chanel No. 5.

1184
01:24:08,440 --> 01:24:10,640
You did away with all of them:

1185
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:14,280
Metzner, Goldman
and your father.

1186
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:16,080
If you had your way...

1187
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:19,920
...you'd do away with all men,
would you not, Miss Twain?

1188
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:22,840
Men who have made you suffer...

1189
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,640
...because you were
born with brains...

1190
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:30,320
...talent, money, everything
but that which you most desired:

1191
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:32,280
Beauty.

1192
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:34,720
It is a statement of fact...

1193
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:38,240
...that as a man you are passable,
but as a woman...

1194
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:40,560
...you are a dog.

1195
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:44,800
That's your opinion, big boy.

1196
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:47,720
And now my money, please.

1197
01:24:47,880 --> 01:24:52,200
With luck, I can still
make dinner at Maxim's.

1198
01:24:52,360 --> 01:24:54,640
I'd just order
a tuna sandwich...

1199
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:56,880
...because that dough is mine.

1200
01:24:57,040 --> 01:24:58,640
That's right, I'm alive.

1201
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:02,120
Miss Skeffington
dropped your bomb down the john.

1202
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:06,760
It blew up as she flushed.
The seat missed her head by an inch.

1203
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:09,640
I'm all right, J.J.

1204
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:11,360
J.J.?

1205
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:17,760
That's right, folks.
He outsmarted us all.

1206
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:21,280
Sitting behind that desk
is the real Sam Diamond.

1207
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:23,600
My name is Loomis.

1208
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:27,200
J.J. Loomis. I'm an actor.
I do impressions.

1209
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:30,760
I did the Carson show
six times last year.

1210
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:33,160
Diamond hired me for the weekend.

1211
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:35,400
Miss Skeffington
is Vilma Norman.

1212
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:39,600
She's a cocktail waitress
at the Water Bed Motel in Carmel.

1213
01:25:41,480 --> 01:25:43,120
Diamond hated all of you.

1214
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:47,640
You're getting big money, and he
had that office in San Francisco.

1215
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:50,760
If he proved he was number one,
he'd get your clients.

1216
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:53,920
But since I put
all the pieces together...

1217
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:58,840
...I figure that money belongs to me.

1218
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:01,920
Isn't that right, Mr. Diamond?

1219
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:05,920
Wrong.

1220
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:10,120
That would've been so obvious,
a child could have guessed.

1221
01:26:10,280 --> 01:26:13,120
No, colleagues.
What you seem to overlook...

1222
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:16,040
...is the most simple
and direct solution.

1223
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:19,680
That I am indeed Lionel Twain.

1224
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:27,280
You've all been so clever
for so long...

1225
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:29,680
...you've forgotten to be humble.

1226
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:33,040
You've tricked and fooled
your readers for years.

1227
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:36,880
You've tortured us with
surprise endings that made no sense.

1228
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:42,440
You've introduced characters at the
end that weren't in the book before!

1229
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:45,800
You've withheld
clues and information...

1230
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:49,480
...that made it impossible for us
to guess who did it.

1231
01:26:49,640 --> 01:26:53,000
But now the tables are turned.

1232
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:57,080
Millions of angry mystery readers...

1233
01:26:57,240 --> 01:27:00,200
...are now getting their revenge.

1234
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:03,760
When the world learns
I've outsmarted you...

1235
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:08,040
...they'll be selling your $1.95 books
for 12 cents.

1236
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:10,920
It's checkout time,
ladies and gentlemen.

1237
01:27:11,080 --> 01:27:13,800
I have your bills ready.

1238
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:17,200
Credit cards will be accepted.

1239
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:41,400
- Even the scorpion was a fake?
- Everything. The bridge, the maid.

1240
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:45,200
- But you're sure about the scorpion?
- Positive.

1241
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:49,000
Even the fog. He made that with
a dry ice machine. See.

1242
01:27:49,160 --> 01:27:50,960
How awfully unromantic.

1243
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:59,560
Then if he really
was Lionel Twain...

1244
01:27:59,720 --> 01:28:04,040
- ...you must really be Sam Diamond.
- That's right, baby.

1245
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:07,040
I was in disguise,
in disguise, in disguise.

1246
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:10,040
You work hard for
50 bucks in this racket.

1247
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:13,480
I guess that means we won't
see each other again.

1248
01:28:13,640 --> 01:28:17,200
Well, that depends.
I'll be around if you need me.

1249
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:20,680
All you gotta do is whistle.

1250
01:28:21,080 --> 01:28:25,400
- You know how to whistle, don't you?
- Certainly. What do you mean?

1251
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:28,480
Never mind. Forget it.
You ruined it.

1252
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:35,360
I don't understand.
Was there a murder or wasn't there?

1253
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:37,720
Yes. Killed good weekend.

1254
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:39,680
Drive, please.
