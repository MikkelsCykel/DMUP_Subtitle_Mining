1
00:00:01,296 --> 00:00:03,764
- Smart elephant.
- Hey, hey, wait!

2
00:00:03,798 --> 00:00:05,629
Sarah, I have an idea.
You go with me?

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,131
- Okay.
- A little longer?

4
00:00:07,302 --> 00:00:08,769
Yeah.

5
00:00:09,804 --> 00:00:11,999
You know, Sarah,
you're not the first person...

6
00:00:12,307 --> 00:00:14,774
...to harbor anxieties
about their future.

7
00:00:14,809 --> 00:00:17,334
I was literally the poster boy
for that sort of thing.

8
00:00:17,812 --> 00:00:23,148
- Well, how did you figure yourself out?
- Well, I screwed up a lot.

9
00:00:23,318 --> 00:00:24,979
Lived abroad a while.

10
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,845
Did an enormous amount of drugs.

11
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,017
Joined an ashram.

12
00:00:30,325 --> 00:00:32,520
Doodled Grandma.

13
00:00:36,331 --> 00:00:42,031
Then someone told me the most
profound two words I'd ever heard...

14
00:00:42,337 --> 00:00:44,669
..."Be present. "

15
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:48,707
So now all I ever worry about
is my immediate universe...

16
00:00:48,843 --> 00:00:52,142
...which presently consists
of you, me...

17
00:00:52,347 --> 00:00:55,111
...and the deafening silence
coming from that jukebox.

18
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,342
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is my privilege to introduce to you...

19
00:00:58,353 --> 00:01:02,881
...the president of the United States,
William Jefferson Clinton.

20
00:01:03,358 --> 00:01:05,485
Thank you very much.

21
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,725
Do you know him?

22
00:01:08,363 --> 00:01:10,888
You know, I'm not sure
anyone really knows him.

23
00:01:10,923 --> 00:01:13,595
I've spent time with him.

24
00:01:16,871 --> 00:01:18,964
Where are we going?

25
00:01:34,389 --> 00:01:36,823
Can I ask you a question?

26
00:01:38,393 --> 00:01:41,260
What happened that weekend
with Mom?

27
00:01:42,397 --> 00:01:44,592
Skipping all the intimate details,
of course...

28
00:01:44,899 --> 00:01:47,424
...but what happened
that weekend in Cabo?

29
00:01:49,404 --> 00:01:53,397
My parents had a house down there.

30
00:01:53,908 --> 00:01:56,809
I'm staying by myself, pretty much
loafing the summer away...

31
00:01:57,412 --> 00:01:58,504
...when Jocelyn...

32
00:01:59,414 --> 00:02:03,282
When your mom just showed up.

33
00:02:03,418 --> 00:02:06,785
We had a little history together
back in high school.

34
00:02:08,923 --> 00:02:12,552
For three days, all we did
was swim and laugh...

35
00:02:12,927 --> 00:02:14,554
...and I taught her how to surf.

36
00:02:14,929 --> 00:02:21,095
Then one morning I woke up
and she was gone.

37
00:02:21,436 --> 00:02:24,303
Back to Pasadena to get married. L...

38
00:02:26,441 --> 00:02:29,638
I didn't even know
that she was engaged.

39
00:02:33,448 --> 00:02:37,851
Those were probably
the three happiest days of my life.

40
00:02:38,953 --> 00:02:42,787
It's the only time I can remember
ever feeling really...

41
00:02:42,957 --> 00:02:45,255
...peaceful.

42
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,827
Well, why do you think
that she went back?

43
00:02:49,964 --> 00:02:52,660
Security, maybe. I don't know.
She never said.

44
00:02:59,974 --> 00:03:02,374
You know, I can see a lot of her
in you.

45
00:03:03,478 --> 00:03:06,845
She was a very beautiful woman.

46
00:03:09,984 --> 00:03:11,849
So are you.

47
00:03:18,493 --> 00:03:20,461
I have to pee.

48
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,617
What?

49
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,882
Sorry.

50
00:04:00,917 --> 00:04:02,264
Okay.

51
00:04:04,005 --> 00:04:05,336
Well...

52
00:04:13,014 --> 00:04:14,413
Oh, I'm so sorry.

53
00:04:15,516 --> 00:04:18,349
I'm sorry.
I can't believe I just did that.

54
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:21,511
So inappropriate. I didn't...
I mean, I re...

55
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:09,960
Good morning.

56
00:06:11,632 --> 00:06:13,099
Morning.

57
00:06:13,134 --> 00:06:15,625
Best hangover remedy I know.

58
00:06:16,137 --> 00:06:18,104
Five minutes
with your feet over your head...

59
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:20,607
...followed by a three-mile jog,
then a quick swim.

60
00:06:21,142 --> 00:06:23,440
It's better than coffee and aspirin.
Wanna try?

61
00:06:26,147 --> 00:06:28,012
You want coffee and aspirin.

62
00:06:36,157 --> 00:06:39,251
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

63
00:06:47,168 --> 00:06:48,863
Good coffee.

64
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,137
Thank you.

65
00:06:51,172 --> 00:06:53,265
You're welcome.

66
00:06:58,679 --> 00:07:01,011
Where are we?

67
00:07:01,182 --> 00:07:06,814
We are in Half Moon Bay.
It's about a hour south of the city.

68
00:07:07,188 --> 00:07:09,213
San Francisco.

69
00:07:11,192 --> 00:07:13,023
- Anything else I can get you?
- No.

70
00:07:13,194 --> 00:07:17,392
- Sure? Eggs? Orange juice? Paramedics?
- Yeah.

71
00:07:22,203 --> 00:07:25,297
Well, I guess I'd better go.

72
00:07:25,706 --> 00:07:28,424
It was really nice to meet you,
Mr. Burroughs.

73
00:07:28,459 --> 00:07:31,143
It was very nice meeting you,
Ms. Huttinger.

74
00:07:33,214 --> 00:07:34,647
Well. Okay.

75
00:07:35,716 --> 00:07:37,343
Goodbye.

76
00:07:49,907 --> 00:07:52,102
I don't have a car here, do I?

77
00:07:52,409 --> 00:07:53,774
Nope.

78
00:07:55,412 --> 00:07:57,380
Would you...? Would you mind
giving me a...?

79
00:07:57,414 --> 00:08:00,975
Sure. But let's...
Let's grab a bite to eat first.

80
00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:08,972
I need to say something to you.

81
00:08:11,144 --> 00:08:14,580
What you told me last night
about your life in New York...

82
00:08:15,148 --> 00:08:17,446
...your job, the guy...

83
00:08:18,151 --> 00:08:22,144
...suggested that it wasn't anything
to rush back to.

84
00:08:23,657 --> 00:08:29,493
Well, I wouldn't necessarily say...

85
00:08:29,663 --> 00:08:34,896
Look, I realize it's a bit awkward,
given, well, everything.

86
00:08:35,168 --> 00:08:38,035
But last night, it was...

87
00:08:38,171 --> 00:08:41,368
Last night was
pretty spectacular for me.

88
00:08:41,675 --> 00:08:44,838
What I'm saying, Sarah...
What I'm trying to say, Sarah...

89
00:08:45,178 --> 00:08:50,582
...is that I like you.
Very much, I suspect.

90
00:08:50,684 --> 00:08:55,553
And I'd like you to stay
if you felt like you could.

91
00:08:56,189 --> 00:08:57,781
Stay?

92
00:08:58,191 --> 00:09:01,058
Yeah, as in not go.

93
00:09:02,696 --> 00:09:06,962
- You don't like the idea.
- Well, I...

94
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,328
I don't... I just sort of...

95
00:09:11,204 --> 00:09:14,935
- I thought we were going to eat.
- We are.

96
00:09:15,709 --> 00:09:19,372
- Good morning, Mr. Burroughs.
- Good morning.

97
00:09:21,214 --> 00:09:24,012
It's just a quick trip
up to the Wine Country and back.

98
00:09:24,718 --> 00:09:28,279
Well, do I even have a choice
in the matter?

99
00:09:30,724 --> 00:09:32,715
So, what do you think?

100
00:09:32,726 --> 00:09:37,254
I think I would feel safer if that guy
was sitting up here instead of me.

101
00:09:39,733 --> 00:09:41,894
You think I'm too old for you,
don't you?

102
00:09:42,235 --> 00:09:43,793
No.

103
00:09:45,238 --> 00:09:47,172
Then?

104
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,209
You've... You've slept with my mother
and my grandmother.

105
00:09:50,744 --> 00:09:54,840
- What's your point?
- My point... I mean, I...

106
00:09:55,248 --> 00:09:57,164
This is not normal.
I mean, you know...

107
00:09:57,199 --> 00:09:59,081
You know what,
you are too old for me.

108
00:09:59,252 --> 00:10:02,187
I mean, obviously
I am very confused right now...

109
00:10:02,756 --> 00:10:06,123
...and last night was some sort of,
I don't know, rite of passage.

110
00:10:06,259 --> 00:10:09,227
Maybe every girl in my family
has to sleep with you.

111
00:10:09,262 --> 00:10:14,461
Well, I don't know if they have to,
but they certainly have.

112
00:11:17,831 --> 00:11:21,858
- Beau Burroughs' office.
- Hi, this is Jeff Daly again.

113
00:11:21,893 --> 00:11:23,826
- I'm sorry, who am I talking to?
- Candace.

114
00:11:23,837 --> 00:11:26,635
Hi, Candace.
Listen, can you tell me where he is?

115
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,171
I really need to reach him.

116
00:11:28,341 --> 00:11:30,434
I'm sorry.
I can't give out that information.

117
00:11:30,844 --> 00:11:32,835
I know, Candace.
You told me that before...

118
00:11:32,846 --> 00:11:34,541
...but this is kind of an emergency.

119
00:11:34,848 --> 00:11:38,079
I'm looking for my fiancée.
She's supposed to be with him.

120
00:11:38,351 --> 00:11:42,344
I haven't heard from her. I'm starting
to feel like something happened to her.

121
00:11:43,857 --> 00:11:46,690
At some point I have to get back.

122
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:51,957
I know. I gotta get back myself.
I got this ball to go to.

123
00:11:51,992 --> 00:11:54,857
A ball? People still go to balls?

124
00:11:55,368 --> 00:11:59,031
They do to this one.
It's the biggest charity event of the year.

125
00:11:59,066 --> 00:12:01,102
It's Casablanca Night.

126
00:12:04,878 --> 00:12:06,743
Why don't you come with me.

127
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,906
- No. L... No, I can't. I can't.
- Why?

128
00:12:10,383 --> 00:12:11,714
- Why?
- No, sorry.

129
00:12:11,885 --> 00:12:13,351
I've got work. I've gotta go back.

130
00:12:13,386 --> 00:12:15,752
You know, I can't have people
dying anonymously...

131
00:12:15,889 --> 00:12:19,347
...while I'm off dancing
at some fabulous, exciting ball.

132
00:12:19,893 --> 00:12:22,225
- All right. Let me make a proposal.
- Oh, boy.

133
00:12:22,395 --> 00:12:24,641
Why don't you come with me tonight.

134
00:12:24,676 --> 00:12:26,888
After the party, I'll fly you home.

135
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,630
Really. I have to be
on the East Coast anyway.

136
00:12:29,903 --> 00:12:31,870
I can just stop
and drop you off in New York.

137
00:12:31,905 --> 00:12:35,204
It'd be no hassle,
and you'll be there by morning.

138
00:12:39,412 --> 00:12:42,904
I know this must seem nuts to you,
but life should be a little nuts.

139
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:47,319
Otherwise, it's just a bunch of
Thursdays, you know, strung together.

140
00:13:08,808 --> 00:13:10,435
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

141
00:13:22,322 --> 00:13:24,347
Okay, who else?

142
00:13:24,824 --> 00:13:26,416
Okay.

143
00:13:27,327 --> 00:13:29,352
You see that guy with the combover?

144
00:13:29,829 --> 00:13:32,297
The one talking to the woman
with the back cleavage?

145
00:13:32,832 --> 00:13:35,863
Yeah. He owns half
of downtown San Francisco...

146
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:38,895
...and the guy next to him,
he owns the other half.

147
00:13:39,339 --> 00:13:42,308
Okay, how about the guy
with the George Hamilton tan?

148
00:13:44,344 --> 00:13:46,539
That's George Hamilton.

149
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:54,308
No, no, you're not gonna get me there.
I don't go to the movies anymore.

150
00:13:54,354 --> 00:13:57,187
It's all special effects.
All they do is blow things up.

151
00:13:57,357 --> 00:14:00,485
I know. They used to make movies
about real things, about people.

152
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,225
- Not anymore.
- Like Chinatown.

153
00:14:02,362 --> 00:14:03,659
- Yes.
- Chinatown.

154
00:14:03,863 --> 00:14:06,229
- Now, that's a movie.
- Oh, I loved that movie.

155
00:14:06,366 --> 00:14:09,199
I didn't understand a thing
that happened, but I loved it.

156
00:14:09,869 --> 00:14:12,201
"My sister. My mother. My sister. "

157
00:14:12,372 --> 00:14:14,499
How about Butch Cassidy
and the Sundance Kid?

158
00:14:14,874 --> 00:14:19,174
- Is that a movie?
- Katharine Ross. I was in love with her.

159
00:14:19,209 --> 00:14:21,244
You wanna talk
about Katharine Ross?

160
00:14:21,881 --> 00:14:23,872
The Graduate.

161
00:14:24,384 --> 00:14:27,217
- Was she drop-dead gorgeous or what?
- Hey, hey.

162
00:14:27,387 --> 00:14:31,084
Let me tell you something about
The Graduate that very few people know.

163
00:14:31,891 --> 00:14:35,019
It was Richard Dreyfuss' first movie.

164
00:14:35,895 --> 00:14:37,226
He had one line:

165
00:14:37,397 --> 00:14:39,388
"Shall I get the cops?
I'll get the cops. "

166
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:41,731
- Yes, that's right!
- He said it to Norman Fell...

167
00:14:41,901 --> 00:14:44,369
...the guy from Three's Company.
- That's right!

168
00:14:44,904 --> 00:14:46,565
In the boarding house, right?

169
00:14:49,909 --> 00:14:53,345
Come on, folks,
all money goes to charity.

170
00:14:54,414 --> 00:14:56,575
Winner, eight the hard way.

171
00:15:12,432 --> 00:15:14,730
Hey, Beau. Patterson's here.

172
00:15:14,934 --> 00:15:18,597
If you go over and talk to him, you could
close this thing in three minutes.

173
00:15:18,938 --> 00:15:20,803
- You remember Sarah Huttinger.
- Yes, hi.

174
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,907
- Nice to see you.
- I'm really not interested.

175
00:15:22,942 --> 00:15:27,675
Three minutes. All right, three minutes.
It's 49 percent for 75 mil.

176
00:15:29,449 --> 00:15:31,440
Any chance we can get
controlling interest?

177
00:15:31,451 --> 00:15:33,214
No, that's a deal breaker.

178
00:15:33,953 --> 00:15:37,013
- We'll see. I'm sorry...
- Go, go, go. Go. Go.

179
00:15:37,457 --> 00:15:40,221
- I'll be right back.
- It's fine.

180
00:16:04,451 --> 00:16:05,782
What's up?

181
00:16:08,455 --> 00:16:10,184
Hi.

182
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,928
This your first Casablanca Night?

183
00:16:16,963 --> 00:16:18,487
Yeah.

184
00:16:18,965 --> 00:16:20,489
Cool.

185
00:16:26,473 --> 00:16:28,100
Is that your real hair color?

186
00:16:30,477 --> 00:16:32,445
- What?
- No, it's good.

187
00:16:32,479 --> 00:16:37,109
I mean, you know, it's silky and shiny.
You could be a good hair model.

188
00:16:38,485 --> 00:16:40,680
- Thank you.
- Sure.

189
00:16:40,987 --> 00:16:43,285
- Wanna have sex?
- Excuse me?

190
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:46,084
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

191
00:16:46,493 --> 00:16:47,959
I was looking for my father.

192
00:16:47,994 --> 00:16:51,953
This is supposed to be his table,
but I don't see him anywhere.

193
00:16:52,499 --> 00:16:56,936
So if he comes by, tell him
that Blake was here for me, would you?

194
00:16:57,003 --> 00:16:58,493
Well, who is your dad?

195
00:16:59,506 --> 00:17:01,440
Beau Burroughs.

196
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:08,914
What? Wait... Wait just one... So, what...?
What are you...? What are you saying?

197
00:17:09,015 --> 00:17:13,042
That Beau... That you're...
That he's... You're... That you're...

198
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,715
You're babbling.

199
00:17:16,022 --> 00:17:17,990
I thought he didn't have any children.

200
00:17:18,525 --> 00:17:20,459
He had at least one.

201
00:17:20,527 --> 00:17:22,518
Champagne guy.

202
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:26,998
Okay. Okay.

203
00:17:27,033 --> 00:17:29,627
Just because he's not sterile...

204
00:17:30,036 --> 00:17:34,666
...does not mean
that I just had sex with my father.

205
00:17:37,043 --> 00:17:38,374
Oh, God.

206
00:17:41,548 --> 00:17:43,014
No, God!

207
00:17:43,049 --> 00:17:45,643
- Oh, God!
- Hey, I'll bite.

208
00:17:48,054 --> 00:17:50,147
What was that?

209
00:17:53,059 --> 00:17:54,686
Are you okay?

210
00:17:56,563 --> 00:17:58,121
Hey, Pops.

211
00:17:59,566 --> 00:18:01,557
Blake. What...?

212
00:18:03,069 --> 00:18:05,731
Welcome back. I thought you were
coming home next week.

213
00:18:06,072 --> 00:18:09,371
No, today. I came home today.

214
00:18:10,577 --> 00:18:13,671
- Sarah, this is Blake. He's my...
- This is your son.

215
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,572
- Right. He's in from Africa.
- No, it was Asia. I was in Asia, Dad.

216
00:18:17,584 --> 00:18:18,949
Asia, right.

217
00:18:19,586 --> 00:18:21,520
- We need to talk.
- I know.

218
00:18:21,588 --> 00:18:23,054
- Alone.
- I know.

219
00:18:23,089 --> 00:18:25,353
- We need to talk alone right now.
- Okay.

220
00:18:26,593 --> 00:18:30,324
God! Blunt testicular trauma?

221
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,363
Come on.

222
00:18:38,605 --> 00:18:41,301
You have a child! You have a son.
You are a sick man.

223
00:18:41,336 --> 00:18:43,234
This isn't The Graduate,
this is Deliverance!

224
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:46,078
Calm down.
There is a simple explanation.

225
00:18:46,112 --> 00:18:47,977
Is he adopted?

226
00:18:50,116 --> 00:18:52,083
- No.
- Then you are a sick man.

227
00:18:52,118 --> 00:18:54,848
I am a sick woman.
We have done a very sick, sick thing!

228
00:18:55,121 --> 00:18:57,088
Blake is not my biological son.

229
00:18:57,123 --> 00:18:59,648
My God, I'm gonna need
so much therapy.

230
00:19:00,126 --> 00:19:02,725
- What did you just say?
- I said that Blake...

231
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,325
...is not my biological son,
nor is he adopted.

232
00:19:05,632 --> 00:19:08,499
My first wife, Cynthia,
wanted to have children of her own.

233
00:19:08,635 --> 00:19:13,038
I, of course, could not do that for her,
so we used an alternative method.

234
00:19:13,139 --> 00:19:14,538
- A donor.
- A donor?

235
00:19:15,141 --> 00:19:17,371
A donor. So technically
Blake is not my son...

236
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:18,940
...but we chose never
to tell him that.

237
00:19:19,145 --> 00:19:21,272
I would appreciate
if you would do the same.

238
00:19:21,648 --> 00:19:23,582
Of course I won't.

239
00:19:25,652 --> 00:19:27,620
But you're still sterile, right?

240
00:19:27,654 --> 00:19:30,622
No, I... I lied. I made up
this whole story...

241
00:19:30,657 --> 00:19:33,353
...just so that I could have sex
with my own daughter.

242
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,924
- All right.
- What kind of guy do you think I am?

243
00:19:36,162 --> 00:19:37,789
Okay, you...

244
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:43,152
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I called you a sick man.

245
00:19:43,187 --> 00:19:46,138
You're not a sick man,
you're a very nice man.

246
00:19:49,676 --> 00:19:50,665
Thank you.

247
00:19:55,882 --> 00:19:58,214
And very charming.

248
00:19:58,885 --> 00:20:00,876
And generous.

249
00:20:03,389 --> 00:20:05,220
And smart.

250
00:20:05,892 --> 00:20:08,190
And accomplished.

251
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,231
And a good pilot.

252
00:20:20,907 --> 00:20:22,875
Very handsome.

253
00:20:26,412 --> 00:20:28,744
Apology accepted.

254
00:20:39,926 --> 00:20:42,326
I hope that's not your father.

255
00:20:45,431 --> 00:20:47,399
Jeff, what are you doing here?

256
00:20:47,934 --> 00:20:50,926
I don't know. I thought something
might have happened to you...

257
00:20:50,937 --> 00:20:52,928
...but apparently
something happened to me.

258
00:20:53,439 --> 00:20:56,408
No, Jeff, wait. Jeff, wait.

259
00:20:56,442 --> 00:20:58,376
Jeff! Jeff, please wait. Jeff!

260
00:20:58,444 --> 00:21:01,208
- What? What?
- Okay, okay. That... That wasn't...

261
00:21:01,447 --> 00:21:03,608
That wasn't... I didn't kiss him.
He kissed me.

262
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:05,474
Did you sleep with him?

263
00:21:05,952 --> 00:21:09,911
I didn't mean to.
I know. God, Jeff. I was so drunk.

264
00:21:10,456 --> 00:21:14,119
I don't remember anything. That's not
an excuse, but it's kind of an excuse.

265
00:21:14,154 --> 00:21:16,360
- Jeff, I love you.
- No! Don't say that.

266
00:21:16,963 --> 00:21:20,922
Don't you say that. Now, I don't know
what game we're playing...

267
00:21:20,967 --> 00:21:24,198
...but obviously this engagement
that you and I have entered into...

268
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:26,597
...has absolutely no meaning to you.

269
00:21:27,974 --> 00:21:30,602
Jeff, I'm so scared.

270
00:21:30,977 --> 00:21:33,502
I'm tired of scared.

271
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,540
No, Jeff, please.
Just please listen to me!

272
00:21:37,984 --> 00:21:39,975
- What?
- I know that you hate me right now.

273
00:21:39,986 --> 00:21:42,011
I hate me right now.
I'm... I'm insane.

274
00:21:42,488 --> 00:21:47,391
It's like I'm possessed by this person
who's terrified and just screwed up.

275
00:21:47,493 --> 00:21:51,520
I know we're good together. You're
the only person I can be myself with.

276
00:21:51,555 --> 00:21:53,863
Even if I don't know
who the hell that is.

277
00:21:55,001 --> 00:21:57,799
Then marry me, Sarah, right now.

278
00:22:02,508 --> 00:22:04,601
Wrong answer.

279
00:22:52,225 --> 00:22:54,056
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

280
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:02,064
- Sarah.
- I found Beau Burroughs.

281
00:23:03,236 --> 00:23:05,636
I didn't know where else to go.

282
00:23:05,738 --> 00:23:08,866
Come in, I'll put on a pot of bourbon.

283
00:23:11,744 --> 00:23:15,680
And I just stood there. I just stood
there and I let Jeff walk away.

284
00:23:16,249 --> 00:23:18,216
I mean, why?
Why couldn't I say yes?

285
00:23:18,251 --> 00:23:21,414
- Grandma, what is wrong with me?
- There is nothing wrong with you.

286
00:23:21,754 --> 00:23:24,655
- And don't call me Grandma.
- Oh, I'm such a mess.

287
00:23:24,757 --> 00:23:27,089
You are not a mess.
You are a human being.

288
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:30,286
And you made a mistake.
People make mistakes.

289
00:23:30,763 --> 00:23:33,891
Sometimes life is just...
Beau Burroughs!

290
00:23:33,926 --> 00:23:35,427
What the hell were you thinking?

291
00:23:35,768 --> 00:23:38,464
- What were you thinking?
- I wasn't thinking!

292
00:23:38,771 --> 00:23:41,188
- Well, I wasn't thinking either!
- What was he thinking?

293
00:23:41,223 --> 00:23:43,606
- We know what he was thinking.
- It's not his fault.

294
00:23:43,776 --> 00:23:46,108
It is always his fault. Of course it is.

295
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:50,443
- He is nothing but a horny bastard.
- Oh, it's me, Grandma, it's me.

296
00:23:50,783 --> 00:23:53,411
- Don't say that!
- Why not? It's the truth.

297
00:23:53,786 --> 00:23:57,255
- I'll say it again. It's me.
- It is not the truth. Hello.

298
00:23:57,290 --> 00:24:00,350
I have happiness staring me
right in the face, and what do I do?

299
00:24:00,385 --> 00:24:01,851
I stare right back at it.

300
00:24:02,795 --> 00:24:05,161
Katharine, I need some help.
Annie's hysterical.

301
00:24:05,298 --> 00:24:09,234
- Annie? Why? What happened?
- She had an anxiety attack on the plane.

302
00:24:09,302 --> 00:24:11,395
- And you know why?
- I don't know, why?

303
00:24:11,804 --> 00:24:14,295
- What? Are you talking to me?
- I'm talking to Sarah.

304
00:24:14,307 --> 00:24:16,400
Because I am my mother's daughter.

305
00:24:16,809 --> 00:24:18,436
- Sarah's there?
- Sarah's there?

306
00:24:18,811 --> 00:24:20,278
- Sarah's here.
- She wasn't happy.

307
00:24:20,313 --> 00:24:22,304
- Your mother was happy.
- She was not happy!

308
00:24:22,315 --> 00:24:25,512
She found out she was pregnant
and left the love of her life...

309
00:24:25,818 --> 00:24:28,844
...to come back and have me.
- The love of her life?

310
00:24:29,322 --> 00:24:31,722
- This is my fault.
- I wanna talk to Sarah!

311
00:24:31,824 --> 00:24:34,156
- She wants to talk to Sarah.
- It's not your fault!

312
00:24:34,327 --> 00:24:36,794
- Yes, it is my fault.
- It is not. It is not!

313
00:24:36,829 --> 00:24:40,230
- Katharine.
- It is. I stole my mother's happiness.

314
00:24:40,833 --> 00:24:42,698
- Katharine!
- You did not!

315
00:24:42,835 --> 00:24:44,928
- I did, I did, I did, I did!
- Katharine!

316
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:48,806
Am I the only sane one here?

317
00:24:48,841 --> 00:24:51,207
- I wanna see Sarah.
- She wants to see Sarah.

318
00:24:51,344 --> 00:24:53,608
- Annie wants to see Sarah.
- Annie?

319
00:24:53,846 --> 00:24:56,713
- Sweetheart, maybe Grandma...
- I only wanna talk to Sarah!

320
00:24:56,849 --> 00:24:59,909
- She only wants to talk to Sarah!
- She wants to talk to Sarah!

321
00:25:00,353 --> 00:25:02,082
She wants to talk to me?

322
00:25:03,322 --> 00:25:05,256
- Hi. Annie okay?
- No. She's upstairs.

323
00:25:05,324 --> 00:25:08,384
We're making her favorite soup,
tomato with crackers. Want some?

324
00:25:08,828 --> 00:25:11,796
- No, I'm okay.
- I thought she was in New York.

325
00:25:11,831 --> 00:25:15,426
She had a fight with Jeff
and she never got on the plane.

326
00:25:15,835 --> 00:25:18,633
Two days ago I thought
I had two happy daughters.

327
00:25:18,838 --> 00:25:22,865
Things are never what they seem
with the women in this family.

328
00:25:30,349 --> 00:25:32,317
Annie?

329
00:25:32,352 --> 00:25:34,285
It's me.

330
00:25:42,361 --> 00:25:46,297
Annie. Honey.

331
00:25:48,367 --> 00:25:50,528
How well did you know Mom?

332
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:53,531
What?

333
00:25:56,876 --> 00:25:59,344
I can't remember her.

334
00:25:59,378 --> 00:26:01,869
I was only 4.

335
00:26:02,882 --> 00:26:04,816
Was she happy?

336
00:26:06,385 --> 00:26:08,046
I don't know.

337
00:26:08,387 --> 00:26:11,254
She always looked so happy
in pictures.

338
00:26:13,392 --> 00:26:15,860
She married so young.

339
00:26:15,895 --> 00:26:18,591
I always thought that, you know,
if she was happy...

340
00:26:18,898 --> 00:26:21,230
...then maybe I would be.

341
00:26:22,401 --> 00:26:24,460
Honey, what happened on the plane?

342
00:26:26,405 --> 00:26:28,805
I just stopped breathing.

343
00:26:29,909 --> 00:26:32,707
We were over the Gulf of Mexico
on the way to Belize...

344
00:26:32,912 --> 00:26:36,678
...and I just stopped.

345
00:26:37,917 --> 00:26:41,284
I kept thinking
that I've ruined my life...

346
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:45,447
...that I've married someone I like to
play tennis with, and that's all I'll do.

347
00:26:45,482 --> 00:26:47,824
And I couldn't breathe.

348
00:26:48,928 --> 00:26:51,192
I know the feeling.

349
00:26:52,932 --> 00:26:55,093
Oh, God.

350
00:26:55,935 --> 00:26:58,267
Annie, let me ask you a question.

351
00:26:58,437 --> 00:27:01,889
When you and Scott play tennis...

352
00:27:01,924 --> 00:27:05,342
...do you guys have fun?
- Yeah.

353
00:27:07,446 --> 00:27:09,471
When you guys go out to dinner?

354
00:27:11,951 --> 00:27:15,079
Yeah. When you watch TV?

355
00:27:15,955 --> 00:27:18,549
- We like The Nanny.
- Nanny's funny.

356
00:27:22,461 --> 00:27:25,021
Honey, sometimes I just think
it's more important...

357
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:27,990
...who we're with
than what we're doing.

358
00:27:28,968 --> 00:27:32,267
And if you're gonna marry someone,
it may as well be your best friend.

359
00:27:33,472 --> 00:27:36,100
Yeah, like you are with Jeff?

360
00:27:37,476 --> 00:27:39,137
Yeah.

361
00:27:39,979 --> 00:27:41,446
Yeah.

362
00:27:43,482 --> 00:27:45,712
Oh, I'm such a mess.

363
00:27:45,985 --> 00:27:48,954
I'm the most screwed-up person
in the world.

364
00:27:48,988 --> 00:27:52,253
You're not even the most
screwed-up person in this room.

365
00:27:52,491 --> 00:27:53,822
Oh, really?

366
00:27:53,993 --> 00:27:58,327
I spent the first night of my honeymoon
in the Houston airport under sedation.

367
00:27:58,497 --> 00:28:00,294
Oh, yeah?

368
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,869
Well, did you sleep with a man who also
slept with Mom and Grandma Katharine?

369
00:28:06,505 --> 00:28:08,564
What?

370
00:28:10,009 --> 00:28:13,843
You slept with Dad?
Dad slept with Grandma Katharine?

371
00:28:14,013 --> 00:28:17,881
Oh, God. No, God, come on,
even I'm not that twisted.

372
00:28:18,517 --> 00:28:22,385
All right. From the beginning.
And don't leave out a thing.

373
00:28:22,521 --> 00:28:25,513
No, the Xanax is for my
other granddaughter.

374
00:28:25,524 --> 00:28:28,993
We're talking about Sarah here,
the one from New York.

375
00:28:29,028 --> 00:28:33,362
Well, she broke up with her boyfriend.
She needs something stronger.

376
00:28:33,532 --> 00:28:35,295
Fine. I'll hold.

377
00:28:35,534 --> 00:28:37,900
Here. You're on hold.

378
00:28:52,551 --> 00:28:55,019
Son of a bitch.

379
00:29:19,078 --> 00:29:20,670
Oh, Jesus.

380
00:29:32,091 --> 00:29:34,025
Hello, Katharine.

381
00:29:34,593 --> 00:29:37,027
You're looking well.

382
00:29:37,096 --> 00:29:38,723
Go shit in your shoes.

383
00:29:39,098 --> 00:29:41,999
Mrs. Richelieu, are
you trying to seduce me?

384
00:29:42,601 --> 00:29:44,626
You weren't that good the first time.

385
00:29:47,106 --> 00:29:49,573
How dare you? Sarah?

386
00:29:49,608 --> 00:29:51,940
You couldn't stop with Jocelyn,
could you?

387
00:29:52,111 --> 00:29:54,102
You almost ruined my daughter's life.

388
00:29:56,115 --> 00:29:57,946
- Wait a minute, Katharine.
- Get down.

389
00:29:58,617 --> 00:30:00,585
Hold on, Katharine.

390
00:30:00,619 --> 00:30:02,610
Ruin her life?

391
00:30:04,123 --> 00:30:06,921
What movie are you living in now,
Katharine?

392
00:30:07,126 --> 00:30:10,289
I didn't pursue Jocelyn,
I don't recall inviting her to Cabo.

393
00:30:10,629 --> 00:30:14,156
And I didn't pursue your granddaughter.
She managed to come 500 miles...

394
00:30:14,191 --> 00:30:16,795
...up to San Francisco on her own
looking for me.

395
00:30:17,136 --> 00:30:21,095
And we both know that I sure as hell
did not pursue you.

396
00:30:22,641 --> 00:30:24,074
I know.

397
00:30:24,643 --> 00:30:26,167
I know.

398
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:33,710
How come we've never
talked like this before?

399
00:30:34,153 --> 00:30:35,984
I don't know.

400
00:30:36,155 --> 00:30:37,884
I've always wanted to.

401
00:30:38,657 --> 00:30:40,386
Me too.

402
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:43,594
- I love you, Annie.
- I love you too.

403
00:30:48,667 --> 00:30:50,635
- Oh, my God.
- What?

404
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:53,154
- It's him.
- Who him?

405
00:30:53,189 --> 00:30:55,139
- "Him" him!
- "Him" him?

406
00:30:55,674 --> 00:30:59,542
Just stop. I mean, this isn't about
Sarah. And it isn't about Jocelyn, is it?

407
00:30:59,678 --> 00:31:02,726
- This is about you.
- You're goddamn right it is.

408
00:31:02,761 --> 00:31:05,775
You dropped me. You dropped me
for a newer model.

409
00:31:06,185 --> 00:31:09,018
Do you know how old
that made me feel?

410
00:31:09,188 --> 00:31:10,883
And you realize,
when you did that...

411
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:14,717
...that I was 13 years younger
than you are now.

412
00:31:15,194 --> 00:31:17,526
I don't know, Katharine.
I haven't done the math.

413
00:31:17,696 --> 00:31:20,028
I suppose everyone
needs someone in their life...

414
00:31:20,199 --> 00:31:23,896
...to let them know when youth
has come to an end.

415
00:31:25,704 --> 00:31:27,194
And here she is.

416
00:31:27,206 --> 00:31:29,504
It's your turn.

417
00:31:30,709 --> 00:31:32,836
- Are you okay?
- She's fine.

418
00:31:33,212 --> 00:31:35,179
Is she happy to see me too?

419
00:31:35,214 --> 00:31:37,705
Beau, you should not
have come down here.

420
00:31:38,217 --> 00:31:40,684
Why not?
He's been everywhere else.

421
00:31:40,719 --> 00:31:43,187
So, what's going on out here?
Lawn party?

422
00:31:43,722 --> 00:31:45,587
- Earl.
- Daddy...

423
00:31:45,724 --> 00:31:49,592
This is... This is Beau Burroughs.
He was a schoolmate of Jocelyn's.

424
00:31:49,728 --> 00:31:52,663
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I know you.
Beau Burroughs.

425
00:31:53,732 --> 00:31:55,529
- I've never forgiven you.
- Okay, Dad...

426
00:31:55,734 --> 00:31:58,601
No, no. This man haunts my dreams.

427
00:31:59,738 --> 00:32:03,174
City soccer final, playing
Pasadena Prep, tie score.

428
00:32:03,242 --> 00:32:06,575
I make it around the last defender,
I'm flying down the field...

429
00:32:06,745 --> 00:32:10,772
...to kick the winning goal.
All of a sudden, this maniac...

430
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:14,742
- That was you?
- You broke my heart.

431
00:32:14,753 --> 00:32:17,153
But I gotta give it to you,
hell of a save.

432
00:32:18,757 --> 00:32:22,386
- You were injured, weren't you?
- Yeah.

433
00:32:22,761 --> 00:32:25,730
What are we standing here for?
You wanna come in the house?

434
00:32:25,764 --> 00:32:28,733
No, thanks. I was...
I just stopped by.

435
00:32:28,767 --> 00:32:31,600
Sarah, could I have a word
with you out at the car?

436
00:32:36,275 --> 00:32:38,743
- It was nice seeing you, Katharine.
- Oh, yeah.

437
00:32:39,278 --> 00:32:43,078
It's wonderful catching up
on old times.

438
00:32:44,283 --> 00:32:45,807
Earl.

439
00:32:46,285 --> 00:32:47,980
Hell of a save.

440
00:33:07,005 --> 00:33:09,405
Why did you come down here, Beau?

441
00:33:10,509 --> 00:33:14,070
Well, for one thing, you left last night
without saying goodbye.

442
00:33:14,513 --> 00:33:16,413
I know. I'm sorry.
I know, I did that.

443
00:33:16,515 --> 00:33:18,847
No, no. I didn't come for an apology.

444
00:33:19,017 --> 00:33:23,317
Obviously your life's more complicated
than you've let on.

445
00:33:24,022 --> 00:33:27,753
I don't know... I don't know what's
going on in your relationship, Sarah...

446
00:33:28,026 --> 00:33:29,618
...and I'm not even gonna ask.

447
00:33:30,028 --> 00:33:34,192
I just... I came down here because
I wanted to tell you something.

448
00:33:35,534 --> 00:33:40,301
When I saw you walk away last night,
when I watched, it...

449
00:33:42,541 --> 00:33:45,738
It might as well have been Cabo
30 years ago.

450
00:33:47,045 --> 00:33:51,175
I didn't tell you the truth before.
I was awake when your mother left.

451
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:56,783
I watched her drive away in this old
wood-paneled station wagon.

452
00:33:58,056 --> 00:34:00,547
It looked like she was crying.

453
00:34:04,563 --> 00:34:06,861
I'm not my mother, Beau.

454
00:34:09,067 --> 00:34:10,557
I know.

455
00:34:14,072 --> 00:34:17,405
You know what I realized
as I was coming back down here?

456
00:34:19,578 --> 00:34:23,639
I am... I'm a year older than she was
when she died.

457
00:34:25,083 --> 00:34:28,450
I mean, you have no idea
how strange that feels.

458
00:34:29,087 --> 00:34:34,457
And I have spent so much of my life
trying to figure out who I am...

459
00:34:35,594 --> 00:34:39,189
...I don't think I realized
I was just trying to find her.

460
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:46,299
You know, but that's just
chasing a ghost, you know?

461
00:34:49,107 --> 00:34:53,271
Maybe we're both just chasing ghosts.

462
00:34:59,618 --> 00:35:01,381
You know?

463
00:35:04,122 --> 00:35:08,183
You're not gonna say, "This could be
the beginning of a beautiful friendship"?

464
00:35:08,218 --> 00:35:09,855
Wrong movie.

465
00:35:14,633 --> 00:35:16,225
Well...

466
00:35:17,135 --> 00:35:18,864
Well...

467
00:35:21,139 --> 00:35:24,199
It was nice meeting you,
Mr. Burroughs.

468
00:35:25,644 --> 00:35:28,374
It was nice meeting you,
Ms. Huttinger.

469
00:35:30,148 --> 00:35:31,843
Goodbye.

470
00:35:33,151 --> 00:35:34,914
Goodbye.

471
00:35:37,122 --> 00:35:40,785
- Let's go. You're gonna miss the plane.
- Coming.

472
00:35:41,126 --> 00:35:43,526
Oh, did you remember to pack
the binoculars, honey?

473
00:35:43,629 --> 00:35:45,096
We might see monkeys.

474
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:48,122
They're still in the bag
with all your shoes.

475
00:35:48,634 --> 00:35:50,625
- Hey.
- You're gonna have a great time.

476
00:35:50,636 --> 00:35:54,094
- Yeah.
- Just remember to keep breathing.

477
00:35:54,139 --> 00:35:57,666
- Yeah. You too.
- You are such a lucky girl.

478
00:35:58,143 --> 00:36:01,510
Most people wait 10 years
for a second honeymoon.

479
00:36:01,647 --> 00:36:04,377
- I know.
- You sure you don't wanna come?

480
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:07,585
- I think I'm just gonna stay here.
- Well, cheer up.

481
00:36:07,653 --> 00:36:10,816
You'll find another man
to screw things up with in no time.

482
00:36:11,156 --> 00:36:13,488
Thank you, Grandma.

483
00:36:27,172 --> 00:36:30,403
Do you think Scott and Annie are
gonna make it to Belize this time?

484
00:36:30,676 --> 00:36:32,041
I certainly hope so.

485
00:36:36,682 --> 00:36:38,411
So...

486
00:36:40,185 --> 00:36:42,449
...what are we gonna do with you?

487
00:36:52,197 --> 00:36:54,062
Dad, can I ask you a question?

488
00:36:59,204 --> 00:37:02,105
Before you and Mom got married...

489
00:37:03,208 --> 00:37:06,735
...do you remember if Mom...

490
00:37:07,212 --> 00:37:11,615
...sort of took off for a few days?
- You mean when she went to Mexico?

491
00:37:12,718 --> 00:37:15,448
- Yeah.
- With Beau Burroughs?

492
00:37:16,221 --> 00:37:17,813
Yeah.

493
00:37:18,724 --> 00:37:21,056
You knew about that?

494
00:37:22,227 --> 00:37:24,388
Daddy, why didn't you
just say something?

495
00:37:24,423 --> 00:37:28,188
What for? I got your mom, he didn't.

496
00:37:33,238 --> 00:37:36,571
Did she ever tell you
why she came back?

497
00:37:43,248 --> 00:37:45,239
Because she loved me.

498
00:37:48,754 --> 00:37:52,781
She said that, while being
with Beau was an adventure...

499
00:37:53,258 --> 00:37:56,386
...she knew that she could
build a life with me.

500
00:37:59,264 --> 00:38:03,325
She apologized, she offered to tell me
everything that happened...

501
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:08,001
...and I didn't need to know.

502
00:38:09,775 --> 00:38:12,073
As long as she was back.

503
00:38:19,284 --> 00:38:20,615
Come here.

504
00:38:25,791 --> 00:38:28,385
Now, this may not be
the sort of thing...

505
00:38:28,794 --> 00:38:31,627
...that you wanna know
about your parents...

506
00:38:33,298 --> 00:38:37,997
...but the night that she came back
is the night we conceived you.

507
00:38:43,809 --> 00:38:46,710
Lucky for us we were married
the next week, so nobody noticed.

508
00:38:56,321 --> 00:38:59,779
Oh, Daddy, I don't understand.

509
00:38:59,825 --> 00:39:02,316
Why are we so different?

510
00:39:03,829 --> 00:39:06,093
I mean, I don't like tennis.

511
00:39:06,832 --> 00:39:09,397
I drive like a crazy person...

512
00:39:09,432 --> 00:39:11,962
...and you always drive so slow.

513
00:39:12,337 --> 00:39:16,137
I only drive slow, sweetheart,
because you're in the car with me.

514
00:39:21,847 --> 00:39:23,940
Oh, Dad.

515
00:39:30,856 --> 00:39:34,656
- Take me to the airport.
- You gonna get on the plane this time?

516
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:38,261
- I promise.
- Come on.

517
00:41:01,479 --> 00:41:05,040
- Thank you.
- Nice seeing you again, Sarah.

518
00:41:37,015 --> 00:41:41,384
If you shut the door, I understand,
but I really hope that you don't.

519
00:42:16,554 --> 00:42:21,321
I know there's nothing that I can say
that will take away...

520
00:42:21,559 --> 00:42:23,527
Then don't try.

521
00:42:29,567 --> 00:42:31,034
I never told you, when I was a kid...

522
00:42:31,069 --> 00:42:33,401
...I was in a car accident
when I was 10.

523
00:42:33,571 --> 00:42:38,008
And I smashed my head on
the dashboard and cracked my skull...

524
00:42:38,576 --> 00:42:40,874
...split it open from here to here,
17 stitches.

525
00:42:41,079 --> 00:42:44,879
And I never thought that I would
long for that day until now.

526
00:42:46,584 --> 00:42:48,768
It didn't mean anything.

527
00:42:48,803 --> 00:42:50,952
It meant something to me.

528
00:42:52,090 --> 00:42:54,057
Words mean something to me.

529
00:42:54,092 --> 00:42:56,788
"Engaged" means something to me.

530
00:42:57,095 --> 00:42:59,325
It doesn't mean
"maybe I'll get married. "

531
00:42:59,597 --> 00:43:02,998
It doesn't mean "I'll see how I feel,
I don't know, I'm not sure. "

532
00:43:03,101 --> 00:43:05,433
It doesn't mean
"I'm gonna test the waters...

533
00:43:05,603 --> 00:43:09,164
...and see if there's somebody else
out there that I like better. "

534
00:43:09,607 --> 00:43:11,905
It means you've fallen in love
with the person...

535
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:14,044
...that you wanna
spend your life with...

536
00:43:14,612 --> 00:43:17,547
...and that you actually want
to marry them.

537
00:43:18,116 --> 00:43:20,380
I wanna marry you.

538
00:43:21,619 --> 00:43:26,454
I'll marry you next month,
I'll marry you this week.

539
00:43:26,624 --> 00:43:30,025
I'll walk out of this apartment right now
and I will marry you.

540
00:43:30,128 --> 00:43:33,928
It doesn't work that way, okay?
You can't just walk in here now...

541
00:43:34,132 --> 00:43:37,033
...and tell me that you can't
live without me and expect...

542
00:43:37,135 --> 00:43:41,003
What am I supposed to do with that?
I'm supposed to make it all right for you?

543
00:43:41,139 --> 00:43:43,130
I can't anymore.

544
00:43:43,141 --> 00:43:45,541
I don't want you to.

545
00:43:49,147 --> 00:43:51,308
I love you.

546
00:43:53,151 --> 00:43:57,053
I didn't come here to tell you
that I can't live without you.

547
00:43:57,155 --> 00:43:59,180
I can live without you.

548
00:44:03,661 --> 00:44:05,891
I just don't want to.

549
00:45:48,066 --> 00:45:49,658
One condition.

550
00:45:53,571 --> 00:45:55,038
If we have a daughter...

551
00:45:55,573 --> 00:45:58,064
...Burroughs doesn't come
within 1000 miles of her.

552
00:45:58,076 --> 00:45:59,668
It stops with me.

553
00:46:05,583 --> 00:46:08,814
On a cold January night
in the city of New York...

554
00:46:09,087 --> 00:46:12,022
...this man and this woman
slept together.

555
00:46:12,090 --> 00:46:15,651
They also slept together
the next night and the next night...

556
00:46:16,094 --> 00:46:18,619
...and the next night
and the next night.

557
00:46:20,265 --> 00:46:23,723
In the name of God,
I pronounce you husband and wife.

558
00:46:38,783 --> 00:46:40,614
Thanks.

559
00:46:40,785 --> 00:46:43,253
You're gonna have to stop doing that.

560
00:46:58,803 --> 00:47:01,636
Okay, everybody, all the girls.
