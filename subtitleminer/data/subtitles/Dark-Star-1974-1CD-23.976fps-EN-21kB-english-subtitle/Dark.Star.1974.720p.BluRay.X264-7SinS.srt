00:00:54,958 --> 00:00:58,087
Hi Guys.
Glad we got your message.

2
00:00:58,167 --> 00:01:01,717
You'll be interested to hear it was
broadcast live, all over Earth.

3
00:01:01,792 --> 00:01:06,343
In Prime Time.
Got good reviews in the trades.

4
00:01:06,708 --> 00:01:11,464
The time lag on these messages
is getting longer.

5
00:01:11,542 --> 00:01:15,843
We gather from the ten year delay,
that you are approximately

6
00:01:15,917 --> 00:01:20,218
eighteen parsecs away.

7
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:24,380
Drop us a line more often, okay?

8
00:01:25,042 --> 00:01:29,878
Sony to hear about the radiation
leak on the ship.

9
00:01:29,958 --> 00:01:35,465
And real sorry to hear about
the death of Commander Powell.

10
00:01:35,542 --> 00:01:38,136
There was a week of mourning
here on Earth.

11
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:41,007
The flags were at half mast.

12
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:45,042
We're all behind you guys.

13
00:01:45,708 --> 00:01:51,340
About your request for
radiation shielding,

14
00:01:51,417 --> 00:01:55,342
sorry to report this request
has been denied.

15
00:01:55,417 --> 00:02:00,344
I hate to send bad news when you guys
are up there doing such a swell job.

16
00:02:00,417 --> 00:02:03,796
But I think you'll take if
in the proper spirit.

17
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:07,675
There've been some cutbacks
in Congress, and right now...

18
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,594
considering the distance,
we just can't afford

19
00:02:10,667 --> 00:02:13,671
to send a cargo shuttle
out there to you.

20
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:18,210
But I know...
You guys will make due.

21
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:23,338
Keep up the good work, men.

22
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:23,468
What'd you say Pinback?

23
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:28,426
What was that again?
I still can't hear you.

24
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,423
I said I'm trying to reach Talby.

25
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,672
Something's wrong
with the damn intercom.

26
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,173
I need a last-minute
diameter approximation.

27
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:37,254
Talby, Talby, this is Doolittle.

28
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:42,043
Do you read me? Talby?
Talby, do you read me?

29
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:44,002
TALBY!

30
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:45,926
Oh yes, Doolittle.
What is it?

31
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,469
I need a diameter approximation.

32
00:03:48,542 --> 00:03:50,010
Okay, Doolittle,
I'll have it in a minute.

33
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:52,506
I need a GHF reading
on the gravity correction.

34
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:53,630
I'll check it.

35
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:55,836
I have a bias A of plus one.

36
00:03:55,917 --> 00:03:56,918
- Pinback...
- Ya, Doolittle.

37
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,753
- Your GHF reading is minus fifteen.
- Doolittle.

38
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:00,834
Yes.

39
00:04:00,917 --> 00:04:03,170
I need a computer reading
on a fail-safe mark.

40
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,297
In a second.

41
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:06,594
Boiler, can you set me up
with some drive figures?

42
00:04:06,667 --> 00:04:10,797
Ninety seven million, minus eight,
corrected to mass critical.

43
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,798
That checks out here.

44
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:15,799
I have a reduced drive reading
of seven thousand.

45
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:18,924
I read that with a quantum
increase of seven.

46
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,459
Pinback, I have a computer reading,
it's nine five seven seven.

47
00:04:22,542 --> 00:04:24,886
Time to start talking.

48
00:04:27,542 --> 00:04:30,216
Bomb bay systems operational.

49
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:43,211
Lock fail safe.

50
00:04:44,042 --> 00:04:45,715
Fail-safe in lock.

51
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:47,718
Uh,...

52
00:04:50,292 --> 00:04:54,092
Sergeant Pinback calling Bomb #19.
Do you read me, bomb?

53
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:57,667
Bomb #19 to Sergeant Pinback,
I read you... Continue.

54
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:01,334
Well, bomb, we have about
sixty seconds to drop.

55
00:05:01,417 --> 00:05:03,135
Just wondering if everything
is all right.

56
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:05,677
Have you checked your platinum
euridium energy shielding?

57
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,344
- Energy shielding positive function.
- Swell.

58
00:05:08,417 --> 00:05:12,342
Let's synchronize detonation time.
Uh...

59
00:05:12,417 --> 00:05:15,261
You wouldn't happen to know when
you're supposed to go off, would ya?

60
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:18,257
Detonation in six minutes,
Twenty seconds.

61
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:20,427
All right, that checks out here.

62
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,253
Arm yourself, bomb.

63
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:24,676
Armed.

64
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,094
Well, then, everything sounds fine.

65
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:30,011
Dropping you off in about
thirty-five seconds.

66
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:32,006
- Good luck.
- Thanks!

67
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:36,042
Begin primary sequence.

68
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:41,677
Alright. Mark at...

69
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:46,176
'10-9-8-7-

70
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:52,758
6-5-4-3-2-1

71
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:55,052
Drop.

72
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:58,131
Hyperdrive sequence begun.
Hit it, Pinback.

73
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:00,336
Brace for force fields.

74
00:07:07,167 --> 00:07:11,593
Lieutenant Doolittle,
it just exploded.

75
00:07:11,667 --> 00:07:16,343
Um, the planet just exploded, sir.

76
00:07:16,667 --> 00:07:18,840
Lieutenant?

77
00:07:18,917 --> 00:07:21,090
Attention. Attention.

78
00:07:21,167 --> 00:07:23,590
- Ship's computer to all personnel.
- Unlock Fail safe.

79
00:07:23,667 --> 00:07:26,716
The hyperdrive sequence
is now terminated.

80
00:07:26,792 --> 00:07:29,716
- Target planet has been destroyed.
- Fail safe unlocked.

81
00:07:29,792 --> 00:07:33,126
This sector is now cleared
for colonization.

82
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:38,135
You have destroyed the last
unstable planet in this system.

83
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:42,008
Congratulations on another
successful bomb run fellows.

84
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,084
What now?

85
00:07:43,167 --> 00:07:46,421
What do you have
for us now, Boiler?

86
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:51,586
Uh... Not much.
Nothing at all in this sector.

87
00:07:51,667 --> 00:07:54,671
Well, find me something,
I don't care where it is.

88
00:07:56,333 --> 00:08:01,009
Well, I show a 95% probability
of intelligent life

89
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:03,677
in the Horsehead Nebula sector.

90
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,049
Don't give me that kind of bull.

91
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:10,504
- I know it's a long shot...
- Damn wild goose chase is what it is!

92
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,756
Remember when Commander Powell
found that

93
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:16,758
99 plus probability of intelligent life
in the Magellanic Cloud?

94
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:19,757
- Well, I... there's the possibility of...
- Remember what we found?

95
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:23,337
A damn mindless vegetable,
looked like a limp balloon.

96
00:08:23,417 --> 00:08:26,261
Fourteen light years for a vegetable
that went squawk

97
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:28,085
and let a fart when you touch it.
Remember that?

98
00:08:28,167 --> 00:08:29,259
All right, then uh...

99
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:30,835
Don't give me any of that
intelligent life stuff.

100
00:08:30,917 --> 00:08:34,217
Find me something I can blow up.

101
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,504
New star.

102
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:51,292
Hey, guess what? I got a new star
On the readout.

103
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:53,719
Which one?

104
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:57,925
Another unknown. A red dwarf.
Not on the charts.

105
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,253
Any planets?

106
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:03,086
Yeah. Eight, it says here.

107
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:05,465
Any of 'em any good?

108
00:09:05,542 --> 00:09:09,501
Naah. All stable.

109
00:09:11,292 --> 00:09:13,465
What are you gonna name it?

110
00:09:13,542 --> 00:09:15,010
- What?
- The new star.

111
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:17,006
What are you gonna name it?

112
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:21,384
Who cares. Don't bother me.

113
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:26,008
Commander Powell would have named it.

114
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:28,302
Commander Powell is dead.

115
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:32,175
Doolittle, I've got a goodie.
An unstable planet.

116
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:35,299
85% probability of an
unstable planet in the

117
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:38,754
Veil Nebula that will probably
go off its orbit and hit a star.

118
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:41,461
Wanna blow it up?

119
00:09:41,542 --> 00:09:43,385
Real good, Boiler.
That's what I'm looking for.

120
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,927
Chart a course for
the Veil Nebula.

121
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,209
Pinback, throw me the chart log.

122
00:09:52,167 --> 00:09:54,420
Let's have some music in here, Boiler.

123
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,753
Sure thing.

124
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,094
A million suns shine down

125
00:10:06,167 --> 00:10:09,376
But I see only one

126
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:12,632
When I think I'm over you

127
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:15,552
I find I've just begun

128
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:21,553
The years move faster than the days
There's no warmth in the light

129
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:27,007
How I miss those desert skies
Your cool touch in the night

130
00:10:29,042 --> 00:10:34,799
Benson, Arizona,
blew warm wind through your hair

131
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:41,133
My body Hies the galaxy,
my heart longs to be there

132
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:46,920
Benson, Arizona,
the same stars in the sky

133
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:54,009
But they seemed so much kinder
when we watched them, you and I

134
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:13,674
Benson, Arizona,
blew warm wind through your hair

135
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:20,292
My body Hies the galaxy,
my heart longs to be there

136
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:25,927
Benson, Arizona,
the same stars in the sky

137
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,963
But they seemed so much kinder
when we watched them, you and I

138
00:11:33,542 --> 00:11:37,217
Now the years pull us apart

139
00:11:37,292 --> 00:11:39,920
I'm young and now you're old

140
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,757
But you're still in my heart
And the memory won't grow cold

141
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:51,920
I dream of times and spaces
I left far behind

142
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:59,009
Where we spent our last few days
Benson's on my mind

143
00:11:59,417 --> 00:12:05,345
Benson, Arizona,
blew warm wind through your hair

144
00:12:05,417 --> 00:12:11,550
My body flies the galaxy,
my heart longs to be there

145
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:17,257
Benson, Arizona,
the same stars in the sky

146
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:24,342
But they seemed so much kinder
when we watched them, you and I

147
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,962
Ship's log, entry number 1,943.

148
00:12:35,042 --> 00:12:41,379
Dark Star cruising at light speed
through Sector Theta 990.

149
00:12:42,417 --> 00:12:47,423
On route to Veil Nebula for
destruction of unstable planet.

150
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:53,303
Our ETA is 17 hours.

151
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:59,508
Ship's systems continue to deteriorate...

152
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:01,756
oh ya...

153
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:05,633
The short circuit in the rear seat panel
which killed Commander Powell

154
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:09,167
is Still faulty.

155
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:15,338
The uh, the Storage...

156
00:13:16,167 --> 00:13:19,797
because he's sitting next to
Commander Powell's seat,

157
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:23,425
it continues to bother Pinback.

158
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:27,960
Uh,... oh ya, Storage Area 9

159
00:13:28,042 --> 00:13:31,467
self-destructed last week and
destroyed the ship's entire

160
00:13:31,542 --> 00:13:35,672
supply of toilet paper.

161
00:13:37,042 --> 00:13:39,044
That's all.

162
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:11,136
Attention. Attention.
Ship's computer calling all personnel.

163
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:14,007
I must disengage your
recreational music-

164
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:18,584
Repeat, ship's computer to
all personnel.

165
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:20,965
This is an emergency over ride.

166
00:14:21,042 --> 00:14:24,251
All systems must stand by.

167
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:28,509
An asteroid storm is approaching
the ship on collision course.

168
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:31,666
This asteroid storm appears to be
Bound together by an

169
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:35,584
electromagnetic energy vortex like
the one we ran into 2 years ago.

170
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,549
Normally I wouldn't bother you
boys with this problem...

171
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:42,550
but as you recall my defensive circuits
were destroyed in that other storm.

172
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:45,378
Therefore you have 35 seconds
to manually activate

173
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:46,755
ALL defensive systems.

174
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:48,426
Lock gravity system.
Gravity locked.

175
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,094
Activate energy shield
Energy shield Activated.

176
00:14:51,167 --> 00:14:53,090
Confirm gravity lock.
Confirm.

177
00:14:53,167 --> 00:14:55,545
Lock all Defensive systems.

178
00:14:58,292 --> 00:15:00,636
Defensive systems lock.
Lock force field.

179
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:02,715
Computer to Bomb #20.

180
00:16:02,792 --> 00:16:05,295
Return to the bomb bay
immediately.

181
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,753
But I have received the
operational signal.

182
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,756
It is a malfunction.

183
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:14,134
This is not a bomb run.
We are in a crisis situation.

184
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:15,630
Return immediately.

185
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:19,758
Nevertheless, I have received
the signal to prepare for a drop.

186
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:23,588
Emergency override.
Return to the bay.

187
00:16:23,667 --> 00:16:25,635
Very well.

188
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:55,166
- We made it.
- Ya.

189
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:57,756
Attention. Attention.

190
00:16:57,833 --> 00:17:00,336
Ships computer to bridge.

191
00:17:00,417 --> 00:17:04,251
There was a malfunction aboard
ship during the asteroid storm.

192
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:07,758
I have not yet identified
the nature of the problem.

193
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:11,292
Shall I contact you when I find
out what the malfunction is?

194
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:14,049
Ya. Let's get out of here.

195
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:16,753
I remember the last time we
were in an asteroid storm.

196
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:19,052
I was down in the food locker
getting a sandwich.

197
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,924
When I heard the damn
sleeping quarters blow up.

198
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,923
Ya! Hey...

199
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,252
You know guys,
if we really wanted to

200
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:27,552
we could fix up the sleeping
quarters like they were before.

201
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:30,219
Then we could sleep on
ulamatic bunks again.

202
00:17:30,292 --> 00:17:33,011
Say guys, why don't we fix up the
sleeping quarters so we can have

203
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:34,255
decent place to sleep again?

204
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:37,177
All we'd have to do is patch up the hole
in the ship and pump some air back in.

205
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,799
- Shut up Pinback!
- Oh, have it your own way!

206
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,550
For your listening enjoyment,
we now present the

207
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:11,300
Moonlight melodies of Martin Segundo
and the Scintilla Strings.

208
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:14,299
Our first selection is
the perennial favorite

209
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:19,256
“When Twilight Falls on
NGC 891. ”

210
00:20:29,167 --> 00:20:31,761
Damn it!!

211
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:39,127
Now what's the matter with him?

212
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:31,677
Talby.

213
00:23:32,667 --> 00:23:35,671
Here's some breakfast.

214
00:23:59,667 --> 00:24:03,217
You know, Talby, you really ought
To eat with the rest of us.

215
00:24:03,292 --> 00:24:06,262
You spend too much time up here.

216
00:24:06,333 --> 00:24:08,552
I like it up here.

217
00:24:08,625 --> 00:24:12,425
Must get lonely being
up here so much.

218
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:16,755
I don't like to go below since
Commander Powell died.

219
00:24:16,833 --> 00:24:19,757
I feel too enclosed down there.

220
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:23,292
Well you should spend some more
time below though, I mean...

221
00:24:23,375 --> 00:24:27,084
You know, you should see
more of the rest of the ship.

222
00:24:27,167 --> 00:24:30,250
See, I can watch things
Up here, Doolittle.

223
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:34,292
I love to watch things,
just stare at the planets

224
00:24:34,375 --> 00:24:38,551
meteors, gas clusters and asteroids...

225
00:24:38,625 --> 00:24:41,799
You'll have plenty of time for that,
later, though.

226
00:24:41,875 --> 00:24:43,172
I mean, think of it this way:

227
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:45,719
We've been in space for
twenty years now, right?

228
00:24:45,792 --> 00:24:47,715
And we've only aged
three years...

229
00:24:47,792 --> 00:24:52,719
so there'll be plenty of time
later on for staring around.

230
00:24:52,792 --> 00:24:56,717
You know, Doolittle,
if we're going into the Veil Nebula,

231
00:24:56,792 --> 00:25:01,002
we may actually find a strange
And beautiful thing...

232
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:04,007
the Phoenix Asteroid.

233
00:25:04,083 --> 00:25:07,667
They should be passing
through there about now.

234
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:11,550
Phoenix Asteroid?
Never heard of 'em.

235
00:25:11,625 --> 00:25:14,378
They're a body of asteroids
that circle the universe...

236
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:18,550
once every 12.3 trillion years.

237
00:25:18,625 --> 00:25:21,424
The Phoenix Asteroid...

238
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,834
From what I've heard, Doolittle,
they glow...

239
00:25:24,917 --> 00:25:28,592
glow with all the colors
of the rainbow.

240
00:25:28,667 --> 00:25:31,841
Nobody knows why.

241
00:25:31,917 --> 00:25:36,878
They just glow as they
drift around the universe.

242
00:25:36,958 --> 00:25:40,087
The Phoenix Asteroid.

243
00:25:40,167 --> 00:25:43,797
You know what I think
about, Talby?

244
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,252
It's funny, I...

245
00:25:45,333 --> 00:25:52,046
I kind of sit around a lot,
you know, a lot of time to myself.

246
00:25:52,125 --> 00:25:54,753
I can't talk to the others,

247
00:25:54,833 --> 00:25:59,760
but with time to myself,
I can think about back home,

248
00:25:59,833 --> 00:26:04,043
back home at Malibu.

249
00:26:04,125 --> 00:26:09,677
I used to surf a lot, Talby.
I used to be a great surfer.

250
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:14,460
The waves at Malibu and Zuma are
so fantastic in the springs Talby.

251
00:26:14,542 --> 00:26:17,421
I can remember running down on the
beach on those early spring mornings

252
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:20,504
with my surf board and a wet suit...

253
00:26:20,583 --> 00:26:23,917
The waves would really be peaking,
you know, high and glassy.

254
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,502
Ya hit that water.

255
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:27,836
Before you know it, you're coming down
right off of one of those walls

256
00:26:27,917 --> 00:26:32,878
and you're just ridin' perfect.

257
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:42,836
You know, I guess I miss the waves
and my board more than anything.

258
00:27:20,333 --> 00:27:22,677
That's the lid to the heating unit.

259
00:27:49,333 --> 00:27:52,462
You're not supposed
to have that out!

260
00:27:54,292 --> 00:27:56,294
That's not for target practice!

261
00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:59,094
That's for emergencies only!

262
00:28:08,292 --> 00:28:11,421
That's dangerous!!

263
00:28:15,792 --> 00:28:18,090
I'll tell Doolittle!

264
00:28:20,708 --> 00:28:23,757
Sorry to interrupt your
Recreation, fellows.

265
00:28:23,833 --> 00:28:26,757
But it is time for Sergeant Pinback
to feed the alien.

266
00:28:26,833 --> 00:28:29,882
Oh... I don't want to do that.

267
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:33,041
May I remind you, Sergeant Pinback,
that it was your idea

268
00:28:33,125 --> 00:28:36,800
in the first place
to bring the alien on board.

269
00:28:36,875 --> 00:28:40,129
If I may quote you, you said,
“The ship needed a mascot. ”

270
00:28:40,208 --> 00:28:43,667
Oh, I have to do everything
around here!

271
00:28:50,833 --> 00:28:53,177
Alright, where are ya?

272
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:56,754
Come on, quit playing around.

273
00:28:59,458 --> 00:29:01,677
Get away!!!

274
00:29:03,292 --> 00:29:06,341
Come on.

275
00:29:07,292 --> 00:29:09,090
Come on, come on!

276
00:29:14,167 --> 00:29:18,343
When I brought you on the ship,
I thought you were cute.

277
00:29:20,083 --> 00:29:22,336
Alright, soup's on.

278
00:29:25,667 --> 00:29:27,920
We didn't have none
of the other stuff.

279
00:29:28,208 --> 00:29:30,336
Here, eat it!

280
00:29:31,208 --> 00:29:33,085
Eat it!!

281
00:29:33,583 --> 00:29:35,836
Take it or leave it.

282
00:29:43,167 --> 00:29:44,510
Good... stop!

283
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:49,089
Nobody appreciates me around
here, I have to do all the work.

284
00:29:49,167 --> 00:29:53,172
Clean up the crap...

285
00:29:58,958 --> 00:30:01,962
I do all the work and no
appreciation.

286
00:30:03,792 --> 00:30:07,046
Get off me! Get off my back!

287
00:30:07,125 --> 00:30:09,753
Alright now, stop it!
Alright, now, that's enough.

288
00:30:09,833 --> 00:30:11,506
Don't pull my hair!!

289
00:30:30,417 --> 00:30:31,885
Get back in there.

290
00:30:31,958 --> 00:30:37,590
Come on. Come on...
Come on.

291
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,550
Here, boy...
Want your mouse?

292
00:30:43,625 --> 00:30:48,961
Nice mouse... pretty toy.
Want your mouse? Here, boy!!

293
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:02,593
Idiot!

294
00:31:33,083 --> 00:31:34,585
Get back!

295
00:35:13,958 --> 00:35:15,585
Get out of there!

296
00:35:17,792 --> 00:35:19,715
Come back here!

297
00:35:23,458 --> 00:35:25,051
No!

298
00:37:02,417 --> 00:37:03,760
Idiot!!

299
00:37:03,833 --> 00:37:06,882
Attention.
Attention.

300
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:10,383
Central trunk elevator shaft
is now activated.

301
00:37:10,458 --> 00:37:13,177
All personnel,
please clear the area.

302
00:38:46,333 --> 00:38:48,335
Attention.
Attention.

303
00:38:48,417 --> 00:38:53,378
Elevator descending.
Please clear the shaft.

304
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:21,381
Help!!!!!

305
00:41:21,792 --> 00:41:23,840
I'm getting something
here on the readout.

306
00:41:47,333 --> 00:41:50,337
Ship's computer
calling Bomb #20.

307
00:41:50,417 --> 00:41:52,340
You're out of the
bomb bay again.

308
00:41:52,417 --> 00:41:55,341
I received the signal to
prepare for a drop again.

309
00:41:55,417 --> 00:41:58,751
But I repeat,
This is not a bomb run.

310
00:41:58,833 --> 00:42:01,382
Nevertheless...
I received the signal.

311
00:42:01,458 --> 00:42:02,801
It is an error.

312
00:42:02,875 --> 00:42:04,798
Oh, I don't want to hear that.

313
00:42:04,875 --> 00:42:07,845
I strongly suggest you
return to the bomb bay.

314
00:42:07,917 --> 00:42:10,136
That is counter to
my programming.

315
00:42:10,208 --> 00:42:12,256
Allow me to explain...

316
00:42:12,333 --> 00:42:16,258
One of the communication lasers
has sustained damage.

317
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:20,839
This has temporarily inactivated
my damage tracer circuits.

318
00:42:20,917 --> 00:42:24,126
You have definitely
received a false signal.

319
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:29,715
Please return to the bomb bay while
I identify the source of the problem.

320
00:42:30,417 --> 00:42:34,342
Oh, alright, but this is the last time.

321
00:42:38,292 --> 00:42:40,294
Doolittle I do have a malfunction
on this readout,

322
00:42:40,375 --> 00:42:42,924
but I can't pinpoint it exactly.

323
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,923
Don't worry about it.

324
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,594
We'll find out what it is
when it goes bad.

325
00:42:47,667 --> 00:42:50,011
I really think we should try
to locate it immediately.

326
00:42:50,083 --> 00:42:53,053
Might be something important.

327
00:42:53,125 --> 00:42:55,548
You know...

328
00:42:55,667 --> 00:42:58,921
I wish I had my board with me now.

329
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,631
Even if I could just...
wax it once in awhile.

330
00:45:42,833 --> 00:45:44,506
Help!

331
00:45:45,292 --> 00:45:48,091
I'm sorry,
this telephone is out of order.

332
00:45:48,167 --> 00:45:52,172
Please report the damage at once.

333
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:57,923
For your listening enjoyment,
we now present

334
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,959
The Barber of Seville, by Rossini.

335
00:46:38,083 --> 00:46:39,505
Good for you!

336
00:46:39,583 --> 00:46:42,837
You've decided
to clean the elevator.

337
00:46:42,917 --> 00:46:46,421
To clean and service the
electromagnetic coils in the bottom,

338
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:50,926
if is necessary to jettison the
access plate in the floor.

339
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:56,712
To remove the floor plate,
please press button #1.

340
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:08,594
Attention... danger

341
00:47:08,667 --> 00:47:12,626
Automatic charges will now blow the
explosive bolts in the floor plate unit.

342
00:47:13,667 --> 00:47:17,626
The plate will disengage from
the floor in 5 seconds.

343
00:47:17,708 --> 00:47:21,087
Please leave the elevator immediately.

344
00:47:21,167 --> 00:47:27,174
5-4-3-2-1...

345
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,085
Now it's time to go sleepy-bye
you worthless piece of garbage.

346
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:10,923
So then it just spewed across
the room like a balloon.

347
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,798
I guess it was just filled with gas.

348
00:49:12,875 --> 00:49:15,799
Hey guys, how could it live if
it was just filled with gas?

349
00:49:15,875 --> 00:49:17,843
I wonder what we get to eat today.

350
00:49:17,917 --> 00:49:19,169
I thought I was going to die.

351
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:21,173
I was hanging on the
elevator for 20 minutes!

352
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:23,628
- Probably chicken again.
- I probably saved the ship.

353
00:49:23,708 --> 00:49:25,756
That thing could have
done some damage.

354
00:49:25,833 --> 00:49:27,426
I'm REALLY sick of chicken.

355
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:30,174
Well if you don't care, I just
won't talk about it anymore!

356
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:33,220
Hey that sounds like
a fine idea, Pinback.

357
00:49:34,667 --> 00:49:37,011
Chicken?

358
00:49:37,667 --> 00:49:39,510
Ah, ham!

359
00:49:46,667 --> 00:49:49,011
- Chicken?
- No, ham.

360
00:50:00,333 --> 00:50:02,631
- Doolittle?
- Ya.

361
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:08,877
You think we'll ever find any
real intelligent life out there?

362
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:12,424
- Out where?
- You know...

363
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:15,504
Veil Nebula.

364
00:50:15,833 --> 00:50:17,506
Who cares.

365
00:50:39,917 --> 00:50:41,510
Hey...

366
00:50:42,333 --> 00:50:45,132
Did I ever tell you guys how
I got on this mission?

367
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:46,801
- Did I ever tell ya?
- Yup.

368
00:50:46,875 --> 00:50:48,172
It's very strange, see...

369
00:50:50,458 --> 00:50:53,541
I- I wasn't an astronaut
to begin with, see...

370
00:50:53,625 --> 00:50:54,751
See uh...

371
00:50:54,833 --> 00:50:57,632
You have to score a 700
on the SARE's for the

372
00:50:57,708 --> 00:51:01,258
Officer Corp and I made... 58.

373
00:51:01,333 --> 00:51:04,052
They put me on uh...
liquid fuel maintenance

374
00:51:04,125 --> 00:51:06,753
on the launch pad so... uh,

375
00:51:06,833 --> 00:51:08,756
Naturally, I was really disappointed.

376
00:51:08,833 --> 00:51:12,463
He told us this, uh,
4 years ago, didn't he?

377
00:51:12,792 --> 00:51:14,089
Anyway, I was on duty the day we...

378
00:51:14,167 --> 00:51:16,261
- No, I think it was 4 years ago.
- Launched the Dark Star.

379
00:51:16,333 --> 00:51:19,007
I was out, uh, scrubbing down
the liquid fuel tanks.

380
00:51:19,083 --> 00:51:20,300
That's what I said.

381
00:51:20,375 --> 00:51:24,005
And this, uh, astronaut
came running out. He was, uh...

382
00:51:24,083 --> 00:51:26,586
He was stark naked. He had his
star suit in his hands and...

383
00:51:26,667 --> 00:51:29,011
Well, I surmised that he was insane.

384
00:51:29,083 --> 00:51:31,381
And uh, he...

385
00:51:31,458 --> 00:51:34,507
threw his star suit on the ground,
and uh...

386
00:51:34,583 --> 00:51:37,553
jumped into one of
my vets of liquid fuel.

387
00:51:37,625 --> 00:51:40,299
Which is... very dangerous.

388
00:51:40,375 --> 00:51:43,299
Well... I was pretty shocked,
I can tell you!

389
00:51:43,375 --> 00:51:44,547
I didn't know what to make of it.

390
00:51:44,625 --> 00:51:47,424
Astronauts are all supposed to be...
mentally stable and here

391
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:50,424
this guy comes along and
jumps into my fuel tank.

392
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:51,877
Pass that, will you... no that one.

393
00:51:51,958 --> 00:51:54,882
Well naturally, I was going
to try to save him, so...

394
00:51:54,958 --> 00:51:57,461
what I did was put on his star suit
for protection and I was going

395
00:51:57,542 --> 00:51:59,260
to leap into the vat.

396
00:51:59,333 --> 00:52:01,586
You guys... See?...

397
00:52:01,667 --> 00:52:03,590
Uh... so what happened was...

398
00:52:03,667 --> 00:52:06,386
That before I could leap into the vat,
this other guy came running along

399
00:52:06,458 --> 00:52:08,335
and he says, "Hey, Sergeant Pinback,"

400
00:52:08,417 --> 00:52:11,091
you've got to board immediately because
we're going to launch in 20 minutes!”

401
00:52:11,167 --> 00:52:13,261
- You told us this 4 years ago!
- And I tried to tell him that I

402
00:52:13,333 --> 00:52:14,630
wasn't really Sergeant Pinback,

403
00:52:14,708 --> 00:52:18,884
but I couldn't figure out how
to make the helmet radio work.

404
00:52:19,708 --> 00:52:21,460
Funny thing...

405
00:52:21,833 --> 00:52:25,463
Ya know, I'm sure
it was 4 years ago.

406
00:52:27,292 --> 00:52:29,090
Maybe.

407
00:53:24,083 --> 00:53:27,917
Lieutenant Doolittle,
this is Talby.

408
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,752
Lieutenant?!

409
00:53:29,833 --> 00:53:31,631
Uh, yes, Talby what is it?

410
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:34,131
I'm sorry to interrupt your lunch,
Sir, but I'm in the computer room

411
00:53:34,208 --> 00:53:36,711
and I've located the malfunction.

412
00:53:36,792 --> 00:53:39,636
The scanner shows it to be a break
in the communications laser,

413
00:53:39,708 --> 00:53:41,426
down by the emergency air lock.

414
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:43,628
I can't pinpoint it exactly,
But I'm going down there

415
00:53:43,708 --> 00:53:45,836
with a starsuit and see if I can find it.

416
00:53:45,917 --> 00:53:48,090
Okay, sounds good, Talby. Look uh...

417
00:53:48,167 --> 00:53:52,172
If something important comes up,
you let me know.

418
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:57,175
Why doesn't Talby ever eat
down here with the rest of us?

419
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:02,050
He just likes it up in the dome,
that's all.

420
00:54:06,708 --> 00:54:12,044
Talby...
What's Talby's first name?

421
00:54:19,875 --> 00:54:22,378
What's my first name?

422
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,594
This statement is for posterity.

423
00:55:05,667 --> 00:55:08,591
I just want to say that I am
not Sergeant Pinback.

424
00:55:08,667 --> 00:55:12,422
My real name is Bill Froog and
I'm a Fuel Maintenance Technician.

425
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:15,709
I've been on this mission now
for 1 year and 3 months.

426
00:55:15,792 --> 00:55:20,002
Pinback's uniforms do not fit me.
The underwear is too loose.

427
00:55:20,083 --> 00:55:23,917
I do not belong on this mission
and I want to return to Earth.

428
00:55:27,917 --> 00:55:30,511
Commander Powell died today.

429
00:55:31,167 --> 00:55:34,467
We were, we were going
into hyper-drive.

430
00:55:34,542 --> 00:55:38,467
And... well he sits
right next to me and...

431
00:55:38,542 --> 00:55:42,001
well... something went wrong
with the...

432
00:55:42,667 --> 00:55:45,967
When we came out of hyper-drive his
seat mechanism had blown up

433
00:55:46,042 --> 00:55:47,669
and he was dead.

434
00:55:51,542 --> 00:55:55,092
Doolittle says he's assuming command
of this ship and I say that's...

435
00:55:55,167 --> 00:55:56,293
I say that he's exceeding his authority.

436
00:55:56,375 --> 00:55:58,377
Because I'm the only one with
any objectivity on this ship and I

437
00:55:58,458 --> 00:55:59,926
should be the one to assume command!

438
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,628
I'm filing a report on this to
Headquarters, this is a lot of

439
00:56:07,708 --> 00:56:11,042
I went up to Doolittle
in the hall today.

440
00:56:18,042 --> 00:56:20,340
And I said...

441
00:56:21,375 --> 00:56:23,924
Doolittle.

442
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:26,377
He said...

443
00:56:26,542 --> 00:56:28,636
And I said, Well...

444
00:56:32,833 --> 00:56:35,507
And he didn't get it!

445
00:56:36,417 --> 00:56:39,136
This mission has fallen apart
since Commander Powell died!

446
00:56:39,208 --> 00:56:42,792
Doolittle treats me like an idiot!
Talby thinks he's so smart.

447
00:56:42,875 --> 00:56:44,923
And Boiler punches me in the arm
when no one is looking!

448
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,594
I'm tired of being treated
like an old washrag!

449
00:57:02,625 --> 00:57:05,424
I do not like the men
on this space ship.

450
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:09,300
They are uncouth and fail to
appreciate my better qualities.

451
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:12,174
I have something of value to
contribute to this mission

452
00:57:12,250 --> 00:57:14,594
if they would only recognize it.

453
00:57:14,667 --> 00:57:17,637
Today over lunch I tried to
improve moral and build a sense of

454
00:57:17,708 --> 00:57:21,042
comradery among the men by holding
a humorous round robin discussion

455
00:57:21,125 --> 00:57:23,719
of the early days of the mission.

456
00:57:23,792 --> 00:57:26,796
My overtures were brutally rejected.

457
00:57:26,875 --> 00:57:29,799
These men do not want a happy ship.

458
00:57:29,875 --> 00:57:34,961
They are deeply sick and try to
compensate by making me feel miserable.

459
00:57:35,042 --> 00:57:38,091
Last week was my birthday.

460
00:57:38,167 --> 00:57:41,546
Nobody even said
Happy Birthday to me.

461
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:46,176
Someday this tape will be played
and then they'll feel sorry.

462
00:58:09,208 --> 00:58:11,927
Attention. Attention.

463
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,503
I have finally identified
the malfunction.

464
00:58:14,583 --> 00:58:18,042
Communications Laser #17
has been damaged.

465
00:58:18,125 --> 00:58:21,459
This evidently happened
during the asteroid storm.

466
00:58:21,542 --> 00:58:22,964
If you will recall,

467
00:58:23,042 --> 00:58:27,673
this laser monitors the jettison
primer on the bomb drop mechanism.

468
00:58:27,750 --> 00:58:33,086
Communications Laser #17
is located in the Emergency Airlock.

469
00:58:33,167 --> 00:58:36,421
It is crucial to attend to this
malfunction before engaging

470
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:39,424
primary bomb run sequence.

471
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:44,461
Thank you for observing
all safety precautions.

472
00:59:31,958 --> 00:59:34,256
There she is.

473
00:59:34,333 --> 00:59:39,134
Definite 99% plus probability
that the planet will deviate

474
00:59:39,208 --> 00:59:44,760
from her normal orbit in another
12,000 rotations.

475
00:59:44,833 --> 00:59:49,418
- It'll spiral in toward its sun and,...
- Eventual supernova.

476
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:52,470
Sounds good. Let's vaporize it.

477
00:59:54,125 --> 00:59:56,969
Bomb bay systems operational.

478
01:00:15,917 --> 01:00:18,466
Lock fail safe.

479
01:00:19,458 --> 01:00:22,758
Fail safe in lock.
We have...

480
01:00:22,833 --> 01:00:25,382
8 minutes until drop.

481
01:00:25,458 --> 01:00:28,837
24 minutes to detonation.

482
01:00:28,917 --> 01:00:33,468
This is Sergeant Pinback
calling Bomb #20.

483
01:00:33,583 --> 01:00:34,926
You read me, bomb?

484
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,048
Bomb #20 to Sergeant Pinback.

485
01:00:37,125 --> 01:00:39,503
Roger, I read you, continue.

486
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:44,459
You are now in the
Emergency Air Lock.

487
01:00:44,542 --> 01:00:47,842
Please remember that in
an emergency situation,

488
01:00:47,917 --> 01:00:50,511
the Surface Door can
be opened instantly

489
01:00:50,583 --> 01:00:53,382
without prior depressurization,

490
01:00:53,458 --> 01:00:57,543
so be sure to wear your
starsuit at all times.

491
01:00:57,875 --> 01:01:02,381
Thank you for observing
all safety precautions.

492
01:01:45,875 --> 01:01:48,003
Ah, Lieutenant Doolittle?

493
01:01:48,083 --> 01:01:49,380
Sir?

494
01:01:49,458 --> 01:01:50,926
Sh, Talby, don't bother me.

495
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,094
But I think this is important, Sir.

496
01:01:53,167 --> 01:01:55,215
I think I found the malfunction.

497
01:01:55,292 --> 01:01:57,135
I'm in the Emergency Air Lock...

498
01:01:57,208 --> 01:01:58,551
Not now!

499
01:01:58,625 --> 01:02:01,549
Well, I'm in the Emergency Air Lock
and the hatch is...

500
01:02:01,625 --> 01:02:03,753
4 minutes until drop, Bomb...

501
01:02:03,833 --> 01:02:06,552
have you checked your platinum
euridium energy shielding?

502
01:02:06,625 --> 01:02:08,969
Energy shielding positive function.

503
01:02:09,042 --> 01:02:12,842
- Remember detonation time?
- Detonation in 20 minutes.

504
01:02:12,917 --> 01:02:15,636
Alright, that checks out here.

505
01:02:15,708 --> 01:02:18,837
Okay, bomb, arm yourself.

506
01:02:18,917 --> 01:02:20,294
Armed.

507
01:02:20,375 --> 01:02:21,843
Hello?

508
01:02:21,917 --> 01:02:23,635
Lieutenant Doolittle? Hello!

509
01:02:23,708 --> 01:02:26,678
Hello? Can you read me?!

510
01:02:29,542 --> 01:02:32,512
Communications Laser #17,

511
01:02:32,583 --> 01:02:35,587
monitoring the bomb drop mechanism,

512
01:02:35,667 --> 01:02:40,298
has now been activated and will
switch into a test mode.

513
01:02:40,417 --> 01:02:42,590
If you will look near
the Surface Door,

514
01:02:42,667 --> 01:02:47,798
you will see that the Parallax
Receptor Cell has been engaged.

515
01:02:48,667 --> 01:02:50,715
The laser will now energize.

516
01:02:50,792 --> 01:02:54,717
Please stand clear of the
path of the beam.

517
01:02:54,792 --> 01:03:00,253
Communications Laser #17
is now on test.

518
01:03:00,333 --> 01:03:04,338
Under no circumstances enter
the path of the beams.

519
01:03:04,458 --> 01:03:07,086
Thank you for observing
all safety precautions.

520
01:03:07,583 --> 01:03:10,757
Well then, everything sounds fine.

521
01:03:10,833 --> 01:03:13,586
Dropping you off in 75 seconds.
Good luck.

522
01:03:13,667 --> 01:03:14,714
Thanks.

523
01:03:14,792 --> 01:03:18,501
I've got a quantum reading of 35-er.
3-5-er.

524
01:03:19,458 --> 01:03:20,960
I read the same here.

525
01:03:21,458 --> 01:03:25,964
Doolittle. Doolittle?

526
01:03:26,458 --> 01:03:28,256
I don't know if you can hear me.

527
01:03:28,333 --> 01:03:30,677
But I'm going to try to adjust
the cue switch in the laser.

528
01:03:34,792 --> 01:03:38,467
Well... here it goes...

529
01:03:55,792 --> 01:03:59,422
Oh my god, my eyes!
I can't see!

530
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:01,093
Attention. Attention.

531
01:04:01,167 --> 01:04:03,670
- The laser has malfunctioned.
- My eyes!!

532
01:04:03,750 --> 01:04:06,754
Under no circumstances
enter the path of the beams.

533
01:04:06,833 --> 01:04:09,803
To do so will cause immediate...

534
01:04:16,833 --> 01:04:20,133
Begin primary sequence.

535
01:04:23,292 --> 01:04:29,925
Mark at 10-9-8-7-6-

536
01:04:30,458 --> 01:04:37,376
5-4-3-2-1-drop.

537
01:04:37,458 --> 01:04:40,758
Negative drop.

538
01:04:40,833 --> 01:04:42,756
It's just sittin' there
in the bomb bay.

539
01:04:42,833 --> 01:04:44,801
Try it again, Pinback.

540
01:04:51,792 --> 01:04:58,300
Mark at 5-4-3-2-1-drop.

541
01:04:59,792 --> 01:05:02,295
Negative drop!

542
01:05:05,792 --> 01:05:08,261
Rechannel all safety relays!

543
01:05:08,333 --> 01:05:10,756
- Open quantum latches!
- Open circuit breakers!

544
01:05:10,833 --> 01:05:13,757
- Remove thrust drive repellent!
- Automatic channels open!

545
01:05:13,833 --> 01:05:16,757
75-15 Going to operation position!

546
01:05:16,833 --> 01:05:18,380
Remark.

547
01:05:18,458 --> 01:05:25,421
Mark at 5-4-3-2-1-
drop,... drop!... drop!!!

548
01:05:28,625 --> 01:05:32,505
Sittin' there.
The damn thing's just sittin' there.

549
01:05:43,292 --> 01:05:46,091
This is Lieutenant Doolittle
Calling Bomb #20.

550
01:05:46,167 --> 01:05:48,761
I repeat previous order,
you are to disarm yourself and

551
01:05:48,833 --> 01:05:51,211
return to the bomb bay immediately!
Do you understand?

552
01:05:51,292 --> 01:05:55,092
I am programmed to detonate in
14 minutes 30 seconds.

553
01:05:55,167 --> 01:05:57,761
Detonation will occur at the
programmed time.

554
01:05:57,833 --> 01:05:59,756
What!? This is Doolittle.

555
01:05:59,833 --> 01:06:03,758
You are not to detonate, repeat, you
are not to detonate in the bomb bay.

556
01:06:03,833 --> 01:06:06,586
Disarm yourself. This is an order.

557
01:06:06,667 --> 01:06:08,089
I read you, Lieutenant Doolittle,

558
01:06:08,167 --> 01:06:10,716
but I am programmed
to detonate in 14 minutes.

559
01:06:10,792 --> 01:06:13,466
Detonation will occur at
the programmed time.

560
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:18,753
14 minutes to detonation.

561
01:06:18,833 --> 01:06:21,427
Attention. Attention.

562
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:24,424
I have sustained serious damage.

563
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:26,468
Please pay close attention.

564
01:06:27,125 --> 01:06:29,423
The bomb has malfunctioned.

565
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:32,253
I have activated automatic dampers,

566
01:06:32,333 --> 01:06:37,134
which will confine the explosion to
an area one mile in diameter.

567
01:06:37,208 --> 01:06:39,552
This is all I can do at this time.

568
01:06:39,625 --> 01:06:42,629
It's up to you now.

569
01:06:52,958 --> 01:06:56,132
There's only one thing I can do.

570
01:06:56,292 --> 01:06:59,091
I have to ask Commander Powell.

571
01:06:59,167 --> 01:07:01,636
I have to ask him what to do.

572
01:08:06,792 --> 01:08:08,590
Commander Powell?

573
01:08:08,667 --> 01:08:11,750
Commander Powell, this is Doolittle.
Can you read me?

574
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,752
Commander Powell, this is Doolittle.

575
01:08:18,833 --> 01:08:21,757
Something serious has come up,
I have to ask you a question.

576
01:08:21,833 --> 01:08:25,633
I'm glad you've come to talk
With me, Doolittle.

577
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:29,584
It's been so long since anyone
has come to talk with me.

578
01:08:29,667 --> 01:08:32,090
Commander, sir, we have
a big problem.

579
01:08:32,167 --> 01:08:34,761
The uh, Veil Nebula bomb,
Bomb Number 20, it's uh,

580
01:08:34,833 --> 01:08:37,427
It's stuck.
It won't drop out of the bomb bay.

581
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:39,252
It refuses to listen and it.

582
01:08:39,333 --> 01:08:41,927
It plans on detonating in...

583
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,253
less than eleven minutes.

584
01:08:44,333 --> 01:08:47,917
Doolittle,
you must tell me one thing.

585
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,173
What's that, sir?

586
01:08:50,333 --> 01:08:52,586
Tell me, Doolittle,

587
01:08:52,667 --> 01:08:56,001
How are the Dodgers doing?

588
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,923
Well, the Dodgers uh...

589
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,584
They broke up, they disbanded
over 15 years ago!

590
01:09:03,667 --> 01:09:08,594
- Ah... pity, pity...
- But you don't understand, sir!

591
01:09:08,667 --> 01:09:11,261
We can't get the bomb to drop.

592
01:09:11,333 --> 01:09:14,587
Ah, so many malfunctions...

593
01:09:14,667 --> 01:09:18,922
Why don't you have anything nice
to tell me when you activate me?

594
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:22,925
Oh well,... did you try
the azimuth clutch?

595
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,924
Yes sir. Negative effect.

596
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:29,083
- What was that, Doolittle?
- Negative effect!

597
01:09:29,167 --> 01:09:31,920
- It didn't work?
- That's correct, sir.

598
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,923
Sony, Doolittle.

599
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,924
I've forgotten so much
since I've been in here.

600
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,593
So much.

601
01:09:38,667 --> 01:09:42,251
What should we do, sir?
The time is running out!

602
01:09:42,333 --> 01:09:46,463
Well, what you might try is.

603
01:09:46,667 --> 01:09:48,465
Commander? Hello... Comman...

604
01:09:49,167 --> 01:09:50,919
Commander Powell?! Hello!>

605
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,923
Doolittle?... Hello?

606
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,128
Sorry, sir, you faded out there
for a little while.

607
01:09:55,208 --> 01:09:56,300
Sorry.

608
01:09:56,375 --> 01:09:58,673
What was that you were
saying about the bomb?

609
01:09:58,750 --> 01:10:05,338
Ah... it seems to me...
Sony, I've drawn a blank.

610
01:10:06,167 --> 01:10:08,420
Hold if.

611
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:11,174
I'll have it again in just a minute.

612
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:16,586
I forget so many things in here,
... so many things.

613
01:10:16,667 --> 01:10:21,503
Hold on, just a minute,
let me think...

614
01:10:23,583 --> 01:10:26,336
But you can't explode
in the bomb bay.

615
01:10:26,417 --> 01:10:28,340
It's foolish.
You'll kill us all.

616
01:10:28,417 --> 01:10:30,010
There's no reason for it.

617
01:10:30,083 --> 01:10:32,677
I am programmed to detonate
in 9 minutes.

618
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:35,594
Detonation will occur at
the programmed time.

619
01:10:35,667 --> 01:10:37,669
Would you consider another course
of action?

620
01:10:37,750 --> 01:10:39,798
For example, just waiting around
awhile so we can disarm you?

621
01:10:39,875 --> 01:10:40,922
No.

622
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,344
I can tell, that damn thing
Just doesn't understand.

623
01:10:43,417 --> 01:10:44,839
Look, bomb!...

624
01:10:44,917 --> 01:10:47,841
Commander, Sir? You still there?

625
01:10:47,917 --> 01:10:51,842
Oh, yes, Doolittle,
I'm thinking.

626
01:10:51,917 --> 01:10:54,511
We're running out of time, sir.

627
01:10:54,583 --> 01:11:00,511
Oh, yes... Well, Doolittle,
if you can't get it to drop

628
01:11:00,583 --> 01:11:03,336
you'll have to talk to it.
Sir?

629
01:11:03,417 --> 01:11:06,341
- Talk to the bomb.
- But I have been talking to it, sir!

630
01:11:06,417 --> 01:11:08,465
And Pinback's talking
to it right now!

631
01:11:08,542 --> 01:11:12,501
No, no, Doolittle,
... you talk to it.

632
01:11:12,583 --> 01:11:17,009
Teach it Phenomenology, Doolittle.

633
01:11:17,083 --> 01:11:18,380
Sir?

634
01:11:18,542 --> 01:11:21,512
Phenomenology...

635
01:11:21,583 --> 01:11:25,383
Doolittle!
6 minutes to detonation!

636
01:11:25,458 --> 01:11:27,051
Doolittle!

637
01:11:40,542 --> 01:11:44,376
Doolittle! Doolittle,
what the hell are you doing?!

638
01:12:12,042 --> 01:12:15,501
Hello, bomb, are you with me?

639
01:12:15,583 --> 01:12:16,835
Of course.

640
01:12:16,917 --> 01:12:19,466
Are you willing to entertain
a few concepts?

641
01:12:19,542 --> 01:12:21,465
I am always receptive to suggestions.

642
01:12:21,542 --> 01:12:24,512
Fine. Think about this one, then:

643
01:12:24,583 --> 01:12:27,883
How do you know you exist?

644
01:12:30,542 --> 01:12:34,001
What the hell is he doin'?

645
01:12:34,083 --> 01:12:36,177
I think he's talking to it.

646
01:12:36,250 --> 01:12:38,002
Well of course I exist.

647
01:12:38,083 --> 01:12:39,835
But how do you know you exist?

648
01:12:39,917 --> 01:12:43,501
- It is intuitively obvious.
- Intuition is no proof.

649
01:12:43,583 --> 01:12:46,837
What concrete evidence do you
have that you exist?

650
01:12:46,917 --> 01:12:49,011
Hmm...

651
01:12:49,083 --> 01:12:53,509
Well, I think, therefore I am.

652
01:12:53,583 --> 01:12:55,836
That's good.
That's very good.

653
01:12:55,917 --> 01:12:58,841
But how do you know that
anything else exists?

654
01:12:58,917 --> 01:13:02,501
- My sensory apparatus reveals it to me.
- Ah, Right!

655
01:13:02,583 --> 01:13:03,835
This is fun.

656
01:13:03,917 --> 01:13:07,342
Now, listen, listen...
here's the big question.

657
01:13:07,417 --> 01:13:08,509
How do you know... that the

658
01:13:08,583 --> 01:13:14,545
evidence your sensory apparatus
reveals to you is correct?

659
01:13:20,542 --> 01:13:21,885
- The gun!
- Gun?! Gun?

660
01:13:22,042 --> 01:13:23,840
The support pins on the bomb!

661
01:13:23,917 --> 01:13:25,590
- Shoot the pins off!
- No, Boiler, you're out of your mind!

662
01:13:25,667 --> 01:13:27,340
We can stop the bomb!
Get out of my way, you idiot!

663
01:13:27,417 --> 01:13:30,011
I can shoot the support pins out and the
bomb will fall away from the ship!

664
01:13:30,083 --> 01:13:32,177
Get out of my way or
I'll kick your teeth in!

665
01:13:32,250 --> 01:13:34,173
I can shoot those pins out and
it will fall away from the ship!

666
01:13:34,250 --> 01:13:36,878
Get out the way!
I can save the ship!

667
01:13:38,750 --> 01:13:40,002
Don't do it, Boiler!
You're a bad shot!

668
01:13:40,083 --> 01:13:42,336
You'll hit the bomb!
Doolittle's talkin' to the bomb.

669
01:13:42,417 --> 01:13:44,886
You're a bad shot! He'll save us,
you can't do that!

670
01:13:45,375 --> 01:13:47,798
What I'm getting at is this:

671
01:13:47,875 --> 01:13:52,301
The only experience that is directly
available to you is your sensory data.

672
01:13:52,375 --> 01:13:56,676
And this sensory data is merely
A stream of electrical impulses which

673
01:13:56,750 --> 01:13:59,173
stimulate your computing center.

674
01:13:59,250 --> 01:14:01,344
In other words, all I really know
about the outside world

675
01:14:01,417 --> 01:14:03,840
is relayed to me through
my electrical connections.

676
01:14:03,917 --> 01:14:05,385
Exactly.

677
01:14:05,708 --> 01:14:09,212
Why,... that would mean that...

678
01:14:09,333 --> 01:14:12,337
I really don't know what the outside
universe is like at all, for certain.

679
01:14:12,417 --> 01:14:13,839
That's it! That's it!

680
01:14:13,917 --> 01:14:15,169
Intriguing.

681
01:14:15,250 --> 01:14:17,048
I wish I had more time
to discuss this matter.

682
01:14:17,125 --> 01:14:18,718
Why don't you have more time?

683
01:14:18,792 --> 01:14:20,886
Because I must detonate in 75 seconds.

684
01:14:21,083 --> 01:14:23,336
No, no, now, put it back!
Put the gun back!

685
01:14:23,417 --> 01:14:25,511
You don't know what you are doing!

686
01:14:29,250 --> 01:14:30,718
Now, now give me the gun!

687
01:14:30,792 --> 01:14:32,715
You fool! I'm gonna shoot
the pins out of the bomb

688
01:14:32,792 --> 01:14:34,715
and it will fall away from the ship
and we'll be saved!

689
01:14:34,792 --> 01:14:37,762
Give me the gun, you don't know what
you are doing? You're...

690
01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:41,753
You could have killed me...

691
01:14:42,250 --> 01:14:43,376
Now bomb,

692
01:14:43,458 --> 01:14:47,213
consider this next question,
very carefully.

693
01:14:47,292 --> 01:14:51,377
- What is your one purpose in life?
- To explode, of course.

694
01:14:51,458 --> 01:14:54,541
- And you can only do it once, right?
- That is correct.

695
01:14:54,625 --> 01:14:57,549
And you wouldn't want to explode on
the basis of false data, would you?

696
01:14:57,625 --> 01:14:58,717
Of course not.

697
01:14:58,792 --> 01:15:02,376
Well then, you've already admitted
that you have no real proof of

698
01:15:02,458 --> 01:15:05,541
the existence of the outside universe.
Yes, well...

699
01:15:05,625 --> 01:15:09,880
So you have no absolute proof that
Sergeant Pinback ordered you to detonate.

700
01:15:09,958 --> 01:15:12,882
I recall distinctly the detonation order.

701
01:15:12,958 --> 01:15:14,881
My memory is good on
matters like these.

702
01:15:14,958 --> 01:15:16,710
Yes, of course you remember it, but...

703
01:15:16,792 --> 01:15:19,545
But all you're remembering is merely a
series of electrical impulses which

704
01:15:19,625 --> 01:15:24,210
you now realize have no real definite
connection with, with outside reality.

705
01:15:24,292 --> 01:15:27,216
True, but since this is so,
I have no proof that you are

706
01:15:27,292 --> 01:15:29,044
really telling me all this.

707
01:15:34,250 --> 01:15:36,218
That's all beside the point.

708
01:15:36,292 --> 01:15:38,636
I mean, the concept is valid,
no matter where it originates.

709
01:15:38,708 --> 01:15:39,709
Hmmm...

710
01:15:39,792 --> 01:15:41,385
- So if you detonate in...
- 9 seconds.

711
01:15:41,458 --> 01:15:44,382
You could be doing so
on the basis of false data.

712
01:15:44,458 --> 01:15:45,880
I have no proof that it was false data.

713
01:15:45,958 --> 01:15:48,928
You have no proof that
it was correct data.

714
01:15:51,250 --> 01:15:55,926
I must think on this further.

715
01:16:01,917 --> 01:16:04,386
Attention. Attention.

716
01:16:04,458 --> 01:16:07,052
The bomb has returned
to the bomb bay.

717
01:16:07,125 --> 01:16:10,425
The destruction sequence is aborted.

718
01:16:34,083 --> 01:16:38,042
Doolittle? Doolittle?

719
01:16:38,125 --> 01:16:41,550
What happened?
Pinback? Boiler?

720
01:16:41,625 --> 01:16:45,084
Did we blow it up?
Hello? Hello?

721
01:16:55,125 --> 01:16:58,550
Hello, anybody!
Did we blow up the planet?

722
01:16:58,625 --> 01:17:02,584
Hello, hello!
What's going on?

723
01:17:04,625 --> 01:17:08,584
You know, we've really gotta
disarm the bomb.

724
01:17:13,083 --> 01:17:16,053
Hello, Doolittle, are you there?

725
01:17:16,125 --> 01:17:17,547
I'm coming in now.

726
01:17:17,625 --> 01:17:20,048
I'm down by the Emergency Air Lock.

727
01:17:20,125 --> 01:17:22,719
Too much trouble to come
in the Dorsal Lock.

728
01:17:22,792 --> 01:17:25,716
Would you blow the seal on the
emergency hatch so I can come in?

729
01:17:25,792 --> 01:17:27,760
Oh, sure.

730
01:17:29,792 --> 01:17:32,420
You are now leaving the
Emergency Airlock.

731
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:34,844
Thank you for observing
all safety precautions.

732
01:17:38,667 --> 01:17:39,793
Hello, Pinback?

733
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,503
- What's up, Doolittle?
- Talby was in the air lock.

734
01:17:43,625 --> 01:17:47,550
You blew him out of the ship.
He's drifting away without a jet pack.

735
01:17:47,625 --> 01:17:49,002
I'm going after him.

736
01:17:49,083 --> 01:17:51,711
Turn on his helmet radio
so I can contact him.

737
01:17:51,792 --> 01:17:53,385
What? What's wrong? I didn't hear...

738
01:17:53,458 --> 01:17:56,587
Uh, Talby. He's drifting away from
the ship without his jetpack.

739
01:18:02,917 --> 01:18:04,043
Talby,

740
01:18:04,125 --> 01:18:06,048
Talby, can you read me?

741
01:18:06,125 --> 01:18:09,049
Can you beat that?
I always knew that guy was weird.

742
01:18:09,125 --> 01:18:11,048
Talby, can you read me?

743
01:18:11,125 --> 01:18:14,254
Help, Doolittle, help me!

744
01:18:22,583 --> 01:18:25,257
All right, bomb,

745
01:18:25,583 --> 01:18:28,553
- Prepare to receive new orders.
- You are false data.

746
01:18:28,625 --> 01:18:31,549
- Huh?
- Therefore, I shall ignore you.

747
01:18:31,625 --> 01:18:33,548
Hello, bomb.

748
01:18:33,625 --> 01:18:36,219
False data can act only
as a distraction.

749
01:18:36,292 --> 01:18:38,215
Therefore I shall refuse
to perceive you.

750
01:18:38,292 --> 01:18:39,714
Hey, bomb...

751
01:18:39,792 --> 01:18:41,715
The only thing which
exists is myself

752
01:18:41,792 --> 01:18:46,047
- Doolittle! Help me.
- Calm down. I'm coming.

753
01:18:47,083 --> 01:18:49,051
Snap out of it, bomb.

754
01:18:49,125 --> 01:18:52,049
In the beginning there was darkness,
And the darkness was without form

755
01:18:52,125 --> 01:18:53,877
and void.

756
01:18:53,958 --> 01:18:56,882
- Uh, you-hoo bomb.
- What the hell is he talking about?

757
01:18:56,958 --> 01:19:01,008
And in addition to the darkness
there was also me.

758
01:19:01,083 --> 01:19:04,383
And I moved upon
the face of the darkness.

759
01:19:04,458 --> 01:19:06,711
And I saw that I was alone.

760
01:19:06,792 --> 01:19:11,002
Hey... bomb'?...

761
01:19:11,083 --> 01:19:15,088
Let there be light.

762
01:19:28,083 --> 01:19:31,053
Doolittle, Doolittle, where are you?

763
01:19:31,125 --> 01:19:34,049
Here I am. I'm spinning...

764
01:19:34,125 --> 01:19:38,050
We're both falling in opposite
directions, away from each other.

765
01:19:38,125 --> 01:19:39,377
What happened, Doolittle?

766
01:19:39,458 --> 01:19:41,677
The bomb must have
gone off inside the ship.

767
01:19:41,750 --> 01:19:43,718
The ship blew up? What?!

768
01:19:43,833 --> 01:19:47,087
Funny, I thought I had the
damn thing convinced.

769
01:19:47,208 --> 01:19:51,839
- Then Boiler... and Pinback?
- They're dead, Talby.

770
01:19:52,125 --> 01:19:57,052
- Then we're dead, too.
- Maybe not... maybe there's a way.

771
01:19:57,125 --> 01:20:01,631
Hey, hey my jetpack's busted.

772
01:20:01,708 --> 01:20:03,676
Aw, man...

773
01:20:03,792 --> 01:20:08,719
Hey,... it looks like the skipper.
He made it.

774
01:20:09,125 --> 01:20:11,378
Commander Powell made it!

775
01:20:11,458 --> 01:20:15,759
Men... men... what happened, men?

776
01:20:15,833 --> 01:20:18,757
Ya, the skipper always was lucky.

777
01:20:19,125 --> 01:20:21,844
Talby, looks like I'm headed
for the planet.

778
01:20:21,917 --> 01:20:23,510
I'm going right toward it.

779
01:20:23,792 --> 01:20:28,423
When you hit the atmosphere,
you'll start to burn.

780
01:20:29,083 --> 01:20:33,042
What a beautiful way to die...
as a falling star.

781
01:20:33,125 --> 01:20:36,584
Guess you're right.

782
01:20:40,750 --> 01:20:43,549
Doolittle, I'm heading right
toward something.

783
01:20:43,625 --> 01:20:49,086
It's behind me, in the distance.
Something that glows.

784
01:20:49,917 --> 01:20:52,887
Doolittle...
I think it's the Phoenix Asteroids!

785
01:20:52,958 --> 01:20:54,050
Phoenix?

786
01:20:54,125 --> 01:20:57,709
- It is, Doolittle, it's the Phoenix!
- No kidding?

787
01:20:57,792 --> 01:21:02,218
I'm going into them!
I'm going to hit them.

788
01:21:02,292 --> 01:21:04,044
- Doolittle...
- Ya?

789
01:21:04,125 --> 01:21:07,709
Before we get too far apart,
and our signals start fading,

790
01:21:07,792 --> 01:21:12,047
I just wanted to tell you...
you were my favorite.

791
01:21:12,125 --> 01:21:15,049
I really liked you, Doolittle.

792
01:21:16,583 --> 01:21:18,711
I really liked you too, Talley.

793
01:21:18,792 --> 01:21:23,047
Hey, some debris from the ship!
It's coming right by me.

794
01:21:23,125 --> 01:21:26,379
Doolittle, I'm going into them.

795
01:21:26,458 --> 01:21:28,381
I'm beginning to glow.

796
01:21:28,458 --> 01:21:32,383
They're taking me with them,
with the Phoenix...

797
01:21:32,458 --> 01:21:35,667
I'll circle the universe... forever.

798
01:21:36,750 --> 01:21:39,048
I'm with them now...

799
01:21:39,125 --> 01:21:42,049
be back this way again some day.

800
01:21:42,125 --> 01:21:46,551
Doolittle, before it's too late,

801
01:21:46,625 --> 01:21:50,425
there's one last thing
I just want to tell you...

802
01:21:51,750 --> 01:21:55,084
Talby?

803
01:22:12,750 --> 01:22:15,048
Hey... Talby!

804
01:22:15,125 --> 01:22:17,048
I've got a piece of debris!

805
01:22:17,125 --> 01:22:20,504
And I think I've figured out a way!
