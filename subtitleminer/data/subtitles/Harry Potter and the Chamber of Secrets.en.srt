1
00:01:20,118 --> 00:01:22,029
I can't let you out, Hedwig.

2
00:01:22,198 --> 00:01:25,588
I'm not allowed to use magic
outside of school.

3
00:01:26,038 --> 00:01:29,747
- Besides, if Uncle Vernon...
- Harry Potter!

4
00:01:31,518 --> 00:01:33,076
Now you've done it.

5
00:01:37,718 --> 00:01:40,278
He's in there. Vernon?

6
00:01:42,518 --> 00:01:46,147
I'm warning you, if you can't control
that bloody bird, it'll have to go.

7
00:01:46,678 --> 00:01:48,031
But she's bored.

8
00:01:48,198 --> 00:01:52,510
If I could only let her out
for an hour or two.

9
00:01:52,678 --> 00:01:56,466
So you can send secret messages
to your freaky little friends? No, sir.

10
00:01:56,638 --> 00:02:01,553
But I haven't had any messages
from any of my friends.

11
00:02:01,718 --> 00:02:03,310
Not one...

12
00:02:03,718 --> 00:02:05,117
...all summer.

13
00:02:05,278 --> 00:02:08,395
Who would want to be
friends with you?

14
00:02:10,558 --> 00:02:12,913
I should think you'd be
a little more grateful.

15
00:02:13,078 --> 00:02:16,434
We've raised you since you were a baby,
given you the food off our table...

16
00:02:16,598 --> 00:02:18,634
...even let you have
Dudley's second bedroom...

17
00:02:18,798 --> 00:02:21,232
...purely out of the goodness
of our hearts.

18
00:02:21,638 --> 00:02:23,788
Not now.
It's for when the Masons arrive.

19
00:02:24,238 --> 00:02:27,150
Which should be any minute.

20
00:02:27,798 --> 00:02:30,517
Now, let's go over our schedule
once again, shall we?

21
00:02:30,678 --> 00:02:32,509
Petunia, when the Masons arrive,
you will be...?

22
00:02:32,678 --> 00:02:36,227
In the lounge, waiting to welcome
them graciously to our home.

23
00:02:36,398 --> 00:02:40,152
- Good. And, Dudley, you will be...?
- I'll be waiting to open the door.

24
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:42,149
Excellent.

25
00:02:46,518 --> 00:02:48,270
And you?

26
00:02:48,838 --> 00:02:53,036
I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise
and pretending that I don't exist.

27
00:02:53,198 --> 00:02:54,836
Too right, you will.

28
00:02:54,998 --> 00:02:58,354
With any luck, this could be the day
I make the biggest deal of my career...

29
00:02:58,518 --> 00:03:01,908
...and you will not mess it up.

30
00:03:12,598 --> 00:03:17,228
Harry Potter, such an honor it is.

31
00:03:19,998 --> 00:03:24,708
- Who are you?
- Dobby, sir. Dobby the house-elf.

32
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:26,712
Not to be rude or anything...

33
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:30,666
...but this isn't a great time for me
to have a house-elf in my bedroom.

34
00:03:30,838 --> 00:03:33,227
Yes, sir. Dobby understands.

35
00:03:33,398 --> 00:03:36,390
It's just that Dobby
has come to tell you...

36
00:03:36,558 --> 00:03:41,188
It is difficult, sir.
Dobby wonders where to begin.

37
00:03:41,358 --> 00:03:46,910
- Why don't you sit down?
- Sit down? Sit down?

38
00:03:50,038 --> 00:03:54,350
Dobby, I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to offend you or anything.

39
00:03:54,518 --> 00:03:56,588
Offend Dobby?

40
00:03:56,758 --> 00:03:58,988
Dobby has heard
of your greatness, sir...

41
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:04,710
...but never has he been asked
to sit down by a wizard, like an equal.

42
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:08,112
You can't have met
many decent wizards then.

43
00:04:08,278 --> 00:04:10,587
No, I haven't.

44
00:04:10,758 --> 00:04:13,397
That was an awful thing to say.

45
00:04:14,038 --> 00:04:17,348
- Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby!
- Stop, Dobby. Dobby, shush.

46
00:04:17,518 --> 00:04:18,837
Dobby, please, stop.

47
00:04:23,158 --> 00:04:25,672
Don't mind that. It's just the cat.

48
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:31,875
- Bad Dobby.
- Stop! Stop, Dobby. Please, be quiet.

49
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:34,233
Are you all right?

50
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:37,711
Dobby had to punish himself, sir.

51
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:40,950
Dobby almost spoke ill
of his family, sir.

52
00:04:41,118 --> 00:04:44,906
- Your family?
- The wizard family Dobby serves, sir.

53
00:04:45,078 --> 00:04:47,956
Dobby is bound to serve
one family forever.

54
00:04:48,118 --> 00:04:50,552
If they ever knew Dobby was here...

55
00:04:52,118 --> 00:04:57,670
But Dobby had to come. Dobby has
to protect Harry Potter. To warn him.

56
00:04:57,838 --> 00:05:00,033
Harry Potter must not go back...

57
00:05:00,198 --> 00:05:04,714
...to Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year.

58
00:05:04,878 --> 00:05:09,827
There is a plot, a plot to make
most terrible things happen.

59
00:05:09,998 --> 00:05:13,195
What terrible things?
Who's plotting them?

60
00:05:14,038 --> 00:05:16,393
Can't say.

61
00:05:16,838 --> 00:05:22,310
- Okay, I understand. You can't say.
- Don't make me talk. L...

62
00:05:23,678 --> 00:05:26,829
- Dobby. Dobby, put the lamp down.
- Bad Dobby.

63
00:05:26,998 --> 00:05:30,877
So when they arrive
at the ninth hole...

64
00:05:33,358 --> 00:05:35,826
Give me the lamp.

65
00:05:37,478 --> 00:05:39,787
Dobby, stop!

66
00:05:41,878 --> 00:05:44,756
- Let me go.
- Get in there and keep quiet.

67
00:05:44,918 --> 00:05:48,797
- What the devil are you doing up here?
- I was just...

68
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:51,597
You just ruined the punch line
of my Japanese golfer joke.

69
00:05:52,158 --> 00:05:53,511
Sorry.

70
00:05:54,998 --> 00:05:58,911
One more sound and you'll wish
you'd never been born, boy.

71
00:05:59,078 --> 00:06:02,707
- And fix that door.
- Yes, sir.

72
00:06:04,918 --> 00:06:06,476
See why I've got to go back?

73
00:06:06,638 --> 00:06:10,233
I don't belong here.
I belong in your world, at Hogwarts.

74
00:06:10,398 --> 00:06:14,835
- It's the only place I've got friends.
- Friends who don't write to Harry Potter?

75
00:06:14,998 --> 00:06:17,796
Well, I expect they've been...

76
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:22,429
Hang on. How do you know
my friends haven't been writing to me?

77
00:06:22,838 --> 00:06:25,830
Harry Potter mustn't
be angry with Dobby.

78
00:06:25,998 --> 00:06:30,037
Dobby hoped if Harry Potter
thought his friends had forgotten him...

79
00:06:30,198 --> 00:06:33,713
...Harry Potter might not want
to go back to school, sir.

80
00:06:34,518 --> 00:06:39,069
- Give me those. Now.
- No!

81
00:06:50,878 --> 00:06:54,029
Dobby, get back here.

82
00:06:57,078 --> 00:07:00,275
Dobby, please, no.

83
00:07:00,438 --> 00:07:04,431
Harry Potter must say
he's not going back to school.

84
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:07,113
I can't. Hogwarts is my home.

85
00:07:07,758 --> 00:07:13,116
Then Dobby must do it, sir,
for Harry Potter's own good.

86
00:07:13,278 --> 00:07:18,068
It spread as far as the eye could see,
all over the floor of this building.

87
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:20,115
One plumber said,
"Look at all that water."

88
00:07:20,278 --> 00:07:23,156
The second plumber said,
"Yes, and that's just the top of it."

89
00:07:34,438 --> 00:07:38,351
I'm so sorry. It's my nephew.
He's very disturbed.

90
00:07:38,518 --> 00:07:42,670
Meeting strangers upsets him.
That's why I kept him upstairs.

91
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:56,273
You're never going back to that school.

92
00:07:56,438 --> 00:08:01,273
You're never going to see those
freaky friends of yours again. Never!

93
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:46,627
Hiya, Harry.

94
00:08:47,678 --> 00:08:51,956
Ron. Fred. George.
What are you all doing here?

95
00:08:52,118 --> 00:08:55,827
Rescuing you, of course.
Now, come on, get your trunk.

96
00:09:01,798 --> 00:09:03,914
You better stand back.

97
00:09:04,318 --> 00:09:06,354
Let's go.

98
00:09:10,918 --> 00:09:12,749
- What was that?
- What was it?

99
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:17,074
Potter!

100
00:09:17,238 --> 00:09:18,830
Dad, what's going on?

101
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:22,947
Go. Go. Go.

102
00:09:23,118 --> 00:09:24,107
Dad, hurry up.

103
00:09:25,878 --> 00:09:27,994
- Come on.
- Come on, Harry, hurry up.

104
00:09:29,878 --> 00:09:31,630
Petunia, he's escaping!

105
00:09:33,758 --> 00:09:35,191
- I've got you, Harry.
- Come here!

106
00:09:35,638 --> 00:09:37,390
- Let go of me!
- No, boy!

107
00:09:37,558 --> 00:09:40,436
You and that bloody pigeon
aren't going anywhere.

108
00:09:40,598 --> 00:09:42,156
- Get off!
- Drive!

109
00:09:42,318 --> 00:09:44,115
- Right.
- Right!

110
00:09:44,278 --> 00:09:45,870
No! No! No! No!

111
00:09:50,078 --> 00:09:51,796
Dad!

112
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:01,991
Damn.

113
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:09,667
By the way, Harry, happy birthday.

114
00:10:34,918 --> 00:10:36,636
Come on.

115
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:41,069
Okay, come on.

116
00:10:41,878 --> 00:10:43,994
Okay, come on.

117
00:10:51,878 --> 00:10:55,791
- Think it'd be all right if we had some?
- Yeah, Mum will never know.

118
00:11:11,798 --> 00:11:14,870
It's not much, but it's home.

119
00:11:15,038 --> 00:11:17,233
I think it's brilliant.

120
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:21,553
Where have you been?

121
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:24,870
Harry, how wonderful
to see you, dear.

122
00:11:25,038 --> 00:11:28,474
Beds empty. No note. Car gone.

123
00:11:28,638 --> 00:11:31,516
You could have died.
You could have been seen.

124
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:34,592
Of course, I don't
blame you, Harry, dear.

125
00:11:34,758 --> 00:11:37,670
They were starving him, Mum.
There were bars on his window.

126
00:11:37,838 --> 00:11:42,389
Well, you best hope I don't put bars
on your window, Ronald Weasley.

127
00:11:42,558 --> 00:11:44,594
Come on, Harry,
time for a spot of breakfast.

128
00:11:45,718 --> 00:11:48,357
Here we are, Harry. Now, tuck in.

129
00:11:48,518 --> 00:11:51,954
That's it. There we go.

130
00:11:52,438 --> 00:11:55,794
- Mummy, have you seen my jumper?
- Yes, dear, it was on the cat.

131
00:11:56,358 --> 00:11:57,950
Hello.

132
00:12:02,118 --> 00:12:03,437
What did I do?

133
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:07,989
Ginny. She's been talking about you
all summer. A bit annoying, really.

134
00:12:08,158 --> 00:12:10,672
- Morning, Weasleys.
- Morning, Dad.

135
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:15,193
- What a night. Nine raids. Nine!
- Raids?

136
00:12:15,638 --> 00:12:19,153
Dad works in the Ministry of Magic,
in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office.

137
00:12:19,478 --> 00:12:22,515
Dad loves Muggles,
thinks they're fascinating.

138
00:12:22,678 --> 00:12:24,794
Well, now.

139
00:12:26,638 --> 00:12:27,787
And who are you?

140
00:12:28,558 --> 00:12:31,948
Sorry, sir. I'm Harry, sir.
Harry Potter.

141
00:12:32,358 --> 00:12:35,111
Good Lord. Are you really?

142
00:12:35,638 --> 00:12:39,790
Well, Ron has told us all about you,
of course. When did he get here?

143
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:41,391
This morning.

144
00:12:41,798 --> 00:12:46,553
Your sons flew that enchanted car
of yours to Surrey and back last night.

145
00:12:46,798 --> 00:12:50,029
Did you really? How did it go?

146
00:12:50,198 --> 00:12:54,828
I mean... That was very wrong
indeed, boys. Very wrong of you.

147
00:12:56,118 --> 00:12:59,793
Now, Harry, you must know
all about Muggles.

148
00:13:00,038 --> 00:13:03,917
Tell me, what exactly
is the function of a rubber duck?

149
00:13:08,318 --> 00:13:10,957
Well, that'll be Errol with the post.

150
00:13:16,478 --> 00:13:19,151
Fetch it, will you, Percy, please?

151
00:13:19,478 --> 00:13:22,550
- Errol.
- He's always doing that.

152
00:13:24,158 --> 00:13:27,946
Look, it's our Hogwarts letters.
They've sent us Harry's as well.

153
00:13:28,118 --> 00:13:31,030
Dumbledore must know you're here.
Doesn't miss a trick, that man.

154
00:13:31,198 --> 00:13:33,075
- No.
- This lot won't come cheap.

155
00:13:33,238 --> 00:13:37,390
- The spell books alone are expensive.
- We'll manage.

156
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:42,151
There's only one place we're going to
get all of this. Diagon Alley.

157
00:13:43,358 --> 00:13:44,677
Right.

158
00:13:44,838 --> 00:13:46,874
Here we are, Harry.
You go first, dear.

159
00:13:47,038 --> 00:13:49,871
But Harry's never traveled
by Floo powder before, Mum.

160
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:51,027
Floo powder?

161
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:55,316
You go first, Ron, so that Harry
can see how it's done. Yes.

162
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,715
In you go.

163
00:13:58,238 --> 00:13:59,671
That's it.

164
00:14:03,038 --> 00:14:04,676
Diagon Alley.

165
00:14:10,478 --> 00:14:13,834
You see? It's quite easy, dear.
Don't be afraid. Come on.

166
00:14:15,518 --> 00:14:16,667
Come on.

167
00:14:16,838 --> 00:14:19,910
In you go. That's it. Mind your head.

168
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:23,354
That's right.
Now, take your Floo powder.

169
00:14:24,838 --> 00:14:27,193
That's it, very good.

170
00:14:27,358 --> 00:14:31,510
Now, don't forget to speak
very, very clearly.

171
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:35,553
Diagonally.

172
00:14:41,758 --> 00:14:44,067
- What did he say, dear?
- Diagonally.

173
00:14:44,238 --> 00:14:45,273
I thought he did.

174
00:16:06,798 --> 00:16:12,828
- Not lost, are you, my dear?
- I'm fine, thank you. I was just going...

175
00:16:12,998 --> 00:16:17,310
Come with us. We'll help you
find your way back.

176
00:16:17,838 --> 00:16:20,068
- No. Please...
- Harry?

177
00:16:20,238 --> 00:16:21,273
Hagrid!

178
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:24,316
What do you think
you're doing down here? Come on.

179
00:16:29,878 --> 00:16:34,906
You're a mess, Harry. Skulking around
Knockturn Alley? Dodgy place.

180
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:38,912
Don't want no one to see you there.
People will think you're up to no good.

181
00:16:39,078 --> 00:16:41,228
I was lost, l...

182
00:16:41,398 --> 00:16:44,231
Hang on. What were you
doing down there then?

183
00:16:44,398 --> 00:16:49,313
Me? I was... I was looking
for Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent.

184
00:16:49,478 --> 00:16:52,276
They're ruining all the school cabbages.

185
00:16:57,478 --> 00:16:59,548
Harry. Hagrid.

186
00:16:59,758 --> 00:17:01,111
Hello, Hermione.

187
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:03,992
- It's so good to see you.
- It's great to see you too.

188
00:17:04,638 --> 00:17:07,106
What did you do to your glasses?

189
00:17:07,278 --> 00:17:10,031
<i>Oculus Reparo.</i>

190
00:17:13,358 --> 00:17:15,997
I definitely need to remember that one.

191
00:17:16,158 --> 00:17:19,707
You'll be all right now then, Harry?
Right. I'll leave you to it.

192
00:17:19,878 --> 00:17:21,277
- Okay, bye.
- Thank you. Bye.

193
00:17:21,558 --> 00:17:23,355
Come on, everyone's been so worried.

194
00:17:33,638 --> 00:17:34,707
Harry.

195
00:17:34,878 --> 00:17:37,950
Thank goodness. We'd hoped
you'd only gone one grate too far.

196
00:17:38,118 --> 00:17:40,837
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Gilderoy Lockhart.

197
00:17:40,998 --> 00:17:43,193
Here he is.

198
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:48,596
Mum fancies him.

199
00:17:48,758 --> 00:17:51,875
Make way there, please.
Let me by, madam. Thank you.

200
00:17:52,078 --> 00:17:55,354
Excuse me, little girl.
This is for the <i>Daily Prophet</i>.

201
00:17:59,358 --> 00:18:02,111
It can't be. Harry Potter?

202
00:18:03,598 --> 00:18:05,395
Harry Potter!

203
00:18:05,558 --> 00:18:06,707
Excuse me, madam.

204
00:18:08,638 --> 00:18:12,313
Nice big smile, Harry.
Together, you and I rate the front page.

205
00:18:12,478 --> 00:18:15,515
Ladies and gentlemen,
what an extraordinary moment this is.

206
00:18:15,918 --> 00:18:18,955
When young Harry stepped
into Flourish and Blotts this morning...

207
00:18:19,118 --> 00:18:23,031
...to purchase my autobiography,
<i>Magical Me</i>...

208
00:18:26,398 --> 00:18:29,151
...which, incidentally,
is currently celebrating...

209
00:18:29,318 --> 00:18:33,948
...its 27th week atop
the <i>Daily Prophet</i> bestseller list...

210
00:18:34,118 --> 00:18:38,430
...he had no idea that he would,
in fact, be leaving...

211
00:18:39,558 --> 00:18:44,268
...with my entire collected works...

212
00:18:44,838 --> 00:18:46,954
...free of charge.

213
00:18:49,038 --> 00:18:51,188
Now, ladies?

214
00:18:51,398 --> 00:18:54,390
Harry, now you give me those,
and I'll get them signed.

215
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:57,914
All of you wait outside.
That's it.

216
00:19:06,838 --> 00:19:09,227
I'll bet you loved that,
didn't you, Potter?

217
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:13,710
Famous Harry Potter. Can't go into a
bookshop without making the front page.

218
00:19:14,318 --> 00:19:15,956
Leave him alone.

219
00:19:16,118 --> 00:19:19,474
Look, Potter.
You've got yourself a girlfriend.

220
00:19:19,638 --> 00:19:23,517
Now, now, Draco, play nicely.

221
00:19:23,918 --> 00:19:25,067
Mr. Potter.

222
00:19:27,438 --> 00:19:31,226
Lucius Malfoy. We meet at last.

223
00:19:31,398 --> 00:19:33,514
Forgive me.

224
00:19:34,838 --> 00:19:36,794
Your scar is legend.

225
00:19:37,318 --> 00:19:39,468
As, of course, is the wizard
who gave it to you.

226
00:19:39,798 --> 00:19:41,868
Voldemort killed my parents.

227
00:19:43,878 --> 00:19:47,188
He was nothing more than a murderer.

228
00:19:48,198 --> 00:19:50,996
You must be very brave
to mention his name.

229
00:19:51,638 --> 00:19:52,912
Or very foolish.

230
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:56,708
Fear of a name only increases
fear of the thing itself.

231
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:01,389
And you must be Miss Granger.

232
00:20:04,118 --> 00:20:08,236
Yes, Draco has told me
all about you. And your parents.

233
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:15,988
Muggles, aren't they?

234
00:20:18,838 --> 00:20:23,707
Let me see.
Red hair, vacant expressions...

235
00:20:25,078 --> 00:20:28,275
...tatty, secondhand book.

236
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:31,675
You must be the Weasleys.

237
00:20:32,118 --> 00:20:34,029
It's mad in here.
Let's go outside.

238
00:20:34,198 --> 00:20:37,747
- Well, well, well. Weasley senior.
- Lucius.

239
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:42,429
Busy time at the Ministry, Arthur,
all those extra raids?

240
00:20:42,598 --> 00:20:44,828
I do hope they're paying you overtime...

241
00:20:44,998 --> 00:20:48,035
...but judging by the state of this,
I'd say not.

242
00:20:49,758 --> 00:20:53,353
What's the use in being a disgrace
to the name of wizard...

243
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:55,509
...if they don't even pay you well for it?

244
00:20:55,798 --> 00:21:00,588
We have a very different idea about what
disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy.

245
00:21:00,838 --> 00:21:02,556
Clearly.

246
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:08,107
Associating with Muggles.

247
00:21:12,158 --> 00:21:16,549
And I thought your family
could sink no lower.

248
00:21:19,718 --> 00:21:22,391
I'll see you at work.

249
00:21:26,398 --> 00:21:28,628
See you at school.

250
00:21:36,158 --> 00:21:38,718
- 10:58, come on.
- The train will be leaving any moment.

251
00:21:38,878 --> 00:21:42,029
Fred, George, Percy, you first.

252
00:21:47,398 --> 00:21:48,956
Okay.

253
00:21:54,758 --> 00:21:56,430
After you, dear.

254
00:21:58,518 --> 00:22:01,590
Come on, Ginny,
we'll get you a seat. Hurry.

255
00:22:02,838 --> 00:22:04,829
Let's go.

256
00:22:18,198 --> 00:22:21,235
- What do you two think you're doing?
- Sorry.

257
00:22:21,638 --> 00:22:24,516
Lost control of the trolley.

258
00:22:25,798 --> 00:22:28,028
- Why can't we get through?
- I don't know.

259
00:22:28,198 --> 00:22:31,429
The gateway has sealed
itself for some reason.

260
00:22:32,758 --> 00:22:36,512
The train leaves at exactly 11:00.
We've missed it.

261
00:22:36,678 --> 00:22:39,909
Harry, if we can't get through...

262
00:22:40,198 --> 00:22:42,758
...maybe Mum and Dad can't get back.

263
00:22:43,678 --> 00:22:46,988
Maybe we should just go
and wait by the car.

264
00:22:47,998 --> 00:22:49,272
The car.

265
00:23:00,318 --> 00:23:02,388
Ron, I should tell you...

266
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:06,187
...most Muggles aren't accustomed
to seeing a flying car.

267
00:23:06,358 --> 00:23:07,393
Right.

268
00:23:07,678 --> 00:23:08,667
Okay.

269
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:28,429
Oh, no! The Invisibility Booster
must be faulty.

270
00:23:28,878 --> 00:23:31,870
Come on, then. Let's go lower.
We need to find the train.

271
00:23:32,038 --> 00:23:33,266
Okay.

272
00:23:43,758 --> 00:23:45,714
All we need to do is catch up
with the train.

273
00:23:45,878 --> 00:23:47,470
We can't be far behind.

274
00:23:49,398 --> 00:23:51,992
- Do you hear that?
- We must be getting close.

275
00:23:52,358 --> 00:23:54,428
Hold on.

276
00:24:19,678 --> 00:24:21,748
Harry!

277
00:24:24,278 --> 00:24:26,030
Hold on!

278
00:24:29,238 --> 00:24:31,627
Take my hand!

279
00:24:35,718 --> 00:24:36,912
Hold on!

280
00:24:37,078 --> 00:24:40,514
I'm trying. Your hand's all sweaty.

281
00:24:52,598 --> 00:24:55,749
- I think we found the train.
- Yeah.

282
00:25:11,758 --> 00:25:12,952
Welcome home.

283
00:25:28,438 --> 00:25:29,587
Up! Up!

284
00:25:30,518 --> 00:25:32,588
It's not working!

285
00:25:36,358 --> 00:25:38,826
Up! Ron, mind that tree!

286
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:43,994
Stop! Stop! Stop!

287
00:26:06,158 --> 00:26:10,595
- My wand. Look at my wand.
- Be thankful it's not your neck.

288
00:26:12,158 --> 00:26:15,036
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

289
00:26:49,038 --> 00:26:51,074
Come on, go! Fast!

290
00:27:24,038 --> 00:27:26,711
Scabbers, you're okay.

291
00:27:28,158 --> 00:27:30,114
The car!

292
00:27:44,958 --> 00:27:46,710
Dad's gonna kill me.

293
00:27:54,918 --> 00:27:57,148
See you, Hedwig.

294
00:27:58,438 --> 00:28:00,668
So a house-elf shows up
in my bedroom...

295
00:28:00,838 --> 00:28:03,671
...we can't get through the barrier
to platform 93/4...

296
00:28:03,838 --> 00:28:06,955
...we almost get killed by a tree...

297
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:10,508
Clearly someone doesn't want me
here this year.

298
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:16,791
Well, take a good look, lads.

299
00:28:16,958 --> 00:28:20,712
This night might well be
the last you spend in this castle.

300
00:28:23,398 --> 00:28:26,754
Oh, dear, we are in trouble.

301
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:32,954
You were seen by no less
than seven Muggles.

302
00:28:33,398 --> 00:28:36,037
Do you have any idea
how serious this is?

303
00:28:36,718 --> 00:28:40,393
You have risked
the exposure of our world.

304
00:28:41,038 --> 00:28:43,836
Not to mention the damage you
inflicted on a Whomping Willow...

305
00:28:43,998 --> 00:28:47,035
...that's been on these grounds
since before you were born.

306
00:28:47,478 --> 00:28:50,868
Honestly, Professor Snape,
I think it did more damage to us.

307
00:28:51,038 --> 00:28:52,153
Silence.

308
00:28:54,078 --> 00:29:00,187
I assure you that were you in Slytherin,
and your fate rested with me...

309
00:29:00,358 --> 00:29:03,987
...the both of you would be
on the train home tonight.

310
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:07,268
- As it is...
- They are not.

311
00:29:09,398 --> 00:29:13,277
Professor Dumbledore.
Professor McGonagall.

312
00:29:13,638 --> 00:29:15,071
Headmaster...

313
00:29:15,238 --> 00:29:19,834
...these boys have flouted the Decree
for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry.

314
00:29:19,998 --> 00:29:23,752
- As such...
- I am well aware of our bylaws...

315
00:29:23,918 --> 00:29:26,671
...having written
quite a few of them myself.

316
00:29:27,038 --> 00:29:30,110
However, as head of Gryffindor house...

317
00:29:30,278 --> 00:29:35,068
...it is for Professor McGonagall
to determine the appropriate action.

318
00:29:35,518 --> 00:29:37,588
We'll go and get our stuff, then.

319
00:29:37,758 --> 00:29:40,113
What are you
talking about, Mr. Weasley?

320
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:42,394
You're going to expel us, aren't you?

321
00:29:43,878 --> 00:29:46,870
Not today, Mr. Weasley...

322
00:29:47,038 --> 00:29:51,828
...but I must impress on both of you
the seriousness of what you have done.

323
00:29:52,358 --> 00:29:56,795
I will be writing to your families tonight,
and you will both receive detention.

324
00:30:20,158 --> 00:30:22,547
Morning, everyone.

325
00:30:23,198 --> 00:30:25,632
- Good morning, everyone.
- Good morning, Professor Sprout.

326
00:30:25,798 --> 00:30:29,916
Welcome to Greenhouse Three,
second years. Gather around, everyone.

327
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:32,797
Today we're going to re-pot Mandrakes.

328
00:30:32,958 --> 00:30:36,792
Who here can tell me
the properties of the Mandrake root?

329
00:30:36,958 --> 00:30:38,710
Yes, Miss Granger?

330
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:41,108
Mandrake, or Mandragora...

331
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:46,068
...is used to return those who have been
Petrified to their original state.

332
00:30:46,238 --> 00:30:51,028
It's also dangerous. The Mandrake's
cry is fatal to anyone who hears it.

333
00:30:51,198 --> 00:30:53,917
Excellent. Ten points to Gryffindor.

334
00:30:54,078 --> 00:30:56,638
As our Mandrakes
are still only seedlings...

335
00:30:56,798 --> 00:30:58,629
...their cries won't kill you yet.

336
00:30:58,798 --> 00:31:02,427
But they could knock you out for hours,
which is why I have given you earmuffs...

337
00:31:02,598 --> 00:31:04,031
...for auditory protection.

338
00:31:04,198 --> 00:31:08,476
So could you please put them on,
right away? Quickly.

339
00:31:08,638 --> 00:31:11,311
Flaps tight down,
and watch me closely.

340
00:31:11,478 --> 00:31:14,356
You grasp your Mandrake firmly.

341
00:31:14,518 --> 00:31:17,396
You pull it sharply up out of the pot.

342
00:31:21,478 --> 00:31:23,309
Got it? And...

343
00:31:23,518 --> 00:31:25,554
...now you dunk it down
into the other pot...

344
00:31:25,718 --> 00:31:30,234
...and pour a little sprinkling of soil
to keep him warm.

345
00:31:33,718 --> 00:31:36,790
Longbottom's been neglecting
his earmuffs.

346
00:31:37,198 --> 00:31:41,077
- No, ma'am, he's just fainted.
- Yes, well, just leave him there.

347
00:31:41,438 --> 00:31:44,828
Right, on we go.
Plenty of pots to go around.

348
00:31:44,998 --> 00:31:48,434
Grasp your Mandrake and pull it up.

349
00:32:02,758 --> 00:32:06,387
- There's Nearly Headless Nick.
- Hello, Percy, Miss Clearwater.

350
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:08,992
Hello, Sir Nicholas.

351
00:32:19,998 --> 00:32:23,149
Say it. I'm doomed.

352
00:32:23,958 --> 00:32:25,789
- You're doomed.
- Hi, Harry.

353
00:32:27,958 --> 00:32:30,552
I'm Colin Creevey. I'm in Gryffindor too.

354
00:32:30,718 --> 00:32:32,276
Hi, Colin. Nice to meet you.

355
00:32:32,798 --> 00:32:34,550
Ron, is that your owl?

356
00:32:48,678 --> 00:32:51,238
Bloody bird's a menace.

357
00:32:55,278 --> 00:32:56,711
Oh, no.

358
00:32:56,878 --> 00:33:00,188
Look, everyone.
Weasley's got himself a Howler.

359
00:33:01,598 --> 00:33:06,626
Go on, Ron. I ignored one
from my gran once. It was horrible.

360
00:33:13,518 --> 00:33:15,315
<i>Ronald Weasley!</i>

361
00:33:17,838 --> 00:33:23,674
<i>How dare you steal that car!</i>
<i>I am absolutely disgusted!</i>

362
00:33:23,958 --> 00:33:26,426
<i>Your father's now facing</i>
<i>an inquiry at work...</i>

363
00:33:26,598 --> 00:33:28,873
<i>... and it's entirely your fault!</i>

364
00:33:29,318 --> 00:33:33,027
<i>If you put another toe out of line...</i>

365
00:33:33,198 --> 00:33:36,315
<i>... we'll bring you straight home!</i>

366
00:33:37,078 --> 00:33:40,434
<i>And, Ginny, dear, congratulations</i>
<i>on making Gryffindor.</i>

367
00:33:40,598 --> 00:33:44,147
<i>Your father and I are so proud.</i>

368
00:34:01,678 --> 00:34:07,833
Let me introduce you to your new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

369
00:34:07,998 --> 00:34:09,477
Me.

370
00:34:09,638 --> 00:34:12,072
Gilderoy Lockhart...

371
00:34:12,238 --> 00:34:15,389
...Order of Merlin, Third Class...

372
00:34:15,558 --> 00:34:18,755
...honorary member
of the Dark Force Defense League...

373
00:34:18,918 --> 00:34:21,716
...and five times winner...

374
00:34:22,038 --> 00:34:27,670
...of <i>Witch Weekly</i>'s
Most-Charming-Smile Award.

375
00:34:28,038 --> 00:34:29,471
But I don't talk about that.

376
00:34:29,638 --> 00:34:33,995
I didn't get rid of the Bandon Banshee
by smiling at him.

377
00:34:37,598 --> 00:34:40,317
Now, be warned.

378
00:34:40,598 --> 00:34:42,554
It is my job to arm you...

379
00:34:42,718 --> 00:34:47,838
...against the foulest creatures
known to wizardkind.

380
00:34:48,638 --> 00:34:52,074
You may find yourselves facing
your worst fears in this room.

381
00:34:52,238 --> 00:34:56,117
Know only that no harm
can befall you whilst I am here.

382
00:34:56,278 --> 00:34:59,076
I must ask you not to scream.

383
00:34:59,238 --> 00:35:01,706
It might provoke them.

384
00:35:05,038 --> 00:35:06,517
Cornish pixies?

385
00:35:06,678 --> 00:35:09,590
Freshly caught Cornish pixies.

386
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,394
Laugh if you will, Mr. Finnegan...

387
00:35:12,558 --> 00:35:16,551
...but pixies can be
devilishly tricky little blighters.

388
00:35:16,718 --> 00:35:19,516
Let's see what you make of them.

389
00:35:23,678 --> 00:35:26,795
Come on now, round them up.
They're only pixies.

390
00:35:41,918 --> 00:35:45,877
- You just stay there!
- Please, get me down!

391
00:35:48,118 --> 00:35:50,473
- Get off me!
- Stop. Hold still!

392
00:35:52,038 --> 00:35:55,110
<i>Peskipiksi Pesternomi!</i>

393
00:36:14,278 --> 00:36:18,396
I'll ask you three to just nip
the rest of them back into their cage.

394
00:36:20,078 --> 00:36:22,148
What do we do now?

395
00:36:23,558 --> 00:36:24,991
<i>Immobulus!</i>

396
00:36:34,118 --> 00:36:36,268
Why is it always me?

397
00:36:42,358 --> 00:36:44,952
I spent the summer devising
a whole new Quidditch program.

398
00:36:45,118 --> 00:36:48,633
We're gonna train earlier,
harder and longer.

399
00:36:48,798 --> 00:36:51,949
What...? I don't believe it.

400
00:36:54,638 --> 00:36:57,232
- Where you think you're going, Flint?
- Quidditch practice.

401
00:36:57,398 --> 00:37:01,596
- I booked the pitch for Gryffindor today.
- Easy, Wood. I've got a note.

402
00:37:02,958 --> 00:37:05,074
I smell trouble.

403
00:37:05,638 --> 00:37:09,028
"I, Professor Severus Snape,
do hereby give the Slytherin team...

404
00:37:09,198 --> 00:37:12,554
...permission to practice today, owing
to the need to train their new Seeker."

405
00:37:12,718 --> 00:37:15,278
You've got a new Seeker. Who?

406
00:37:19,078 --> 00:37:21,592
- Malfoy?
- That's right.

407
00:37:21,758 --> 00:37:24,431
And that's not all
that's new this year.

408
00:37:25,238 --> 00:37:28,514
Those are Nimbus 2001 s.
How did you get those?

409
00:37:28,678 --> 00:37:30,669
A gift from Draco's father.

410
00:37:30,838 --> 00:37:34,433
You see, Weasley, unlike some,
my father can afford the best.

411
00:37:34,598 --> 00:37:37,476
At least no one on the Gryffindor team
had to buy their way in.

412
00:37:37,638 --> 00:37:40,436
They got in on pure talent.

413
00:37:43,518 --> 00:37:47,227
No one asked your opinion,
you filthy little Mudblood.

414
00:37:49,638 --> 00:37:52,948
You'll pay for that one, Malfoy.
Eat slugs!

415
00:38:00,198 --> 00:38:01,995
You okay, Ron?

416
00:38:04,878 --> 00:38:06,596
Say something.

417
00:38:12,598 --> 00:38:16,910
- Wow! Can you turn him around, Harry?
- No, Colin, get out of the way.

418
00:38:17,798 --> 00:38:19,754
Let's take him to Hagrid's.

419
00:38:19,918 --> 00:38:21,954
He'll know what to do.

420
00:38:30,478 --> 00:38:33,709
This calls for
a specialist's equipment.

421
00:38:37,318 --> 00:38:40,754
Nothing to do but wait till it stops,
I'm afraid.

422
00:38:41,398 --> 00:38:44,435
- Okay.
- Better out than in.

423
00:38:44,998 --> 00:38:50,118
- Who was Ron trying to curse, anyway?
- Malfoy. He called Hermione...

424
00:38:51,278 --> 00:38:54,554
Well, I don't know
exactly what it means.

425
00:38:58,358 --> 00:39:00,474
He called me a Mudblood.

426
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:03,198
- He did not.
- What's a Mudblood?

427
00:39:03,558 --> 00:39:07,915
It means "dirty blood." Mudblood's a foul
name for someone who's Muggle-born.

428
00:39:08,078 --> 00:39:12,151
Someone with non-magic parents.
Someone like me.

429
00:39:12,638 --> 00:39:16,597
It's not a term one usually hears
in civilized conversation.

430
00:39:17,718 --> 00:39:22,314
See, the thing is, Harry, there are
some wizards, like the Malfoy family...

431
00:39:22,478 --> 00:39:26,949
...who think they're better than everyone
else because they're pure-blood.

432
00:39:27,118 --> 00:39:28,676
That's horrible.

433
00:39:31,558 --> 00:39:32,832
It's disgusting.

434
00:39:32,998 --> 00:39:36,354
And it's codswallop to boot.
Dirty blood.

435
00:39:36,518 --> 00:39:39,749
Why, there isn't a wizard alive today
that's not half-blood or less.

436
00:39:39,918 --> 00:39:44,275
More to the point, they've yet to think
of a spell that our Hermione can't do.

437
00:39:44,438 --> 00:39:46,554
Come here.

438
00:39:47,638 --> 00:39:53,827
Don't you think on it, Hermione.
Don't you think on it for one minute.

439
00:40:01,278 --> 00:40:04,190
Harry, Harry, Harry.

440
00:40:04,358 --> 00:40:06,508
Can you possibly imagine...

441
00:40:06,678 --> 00:40:09,750
...a better way to serve detention...

442
00:40:10,358 --> 00:40:12,952
...than by helping me
to answer my fan mail?

443
00:40:13,118 --> 00:40:14,471
Not really.

444
00:40:14,638 --> 00:40:20,747
Fame is a fickle friend, Harry.
Celebrity is as celebrity does.

445
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:22,749
Remember that.

446
00:40:26,358 --> 00:40:28,428
<i>Come.</i>

447
00:40:28,598 --> 00:40:30,634
<i>Come...</i>

448
00:40:31,838 --> 00:40:34,591
<i>... to me.</i>

449
00:40:37,758 --> 00:40:40,192
- What?
- Sorry?

450
00:40:42,358 --> 00:40:44,235
That voice.

451
00:40:44,398 --> 00:40:45,877
Voice?

452
00:40:49,278 --> 00:40:53,715
- Didn't you hear it?
- What are you talking about, Harry?

453
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:57,754
I think you're getting
a bit drowsy.

454
00:40:57,918 --> 00:41:01,831
And great Scott, no wonder. Look at the
time. We've been here nearly four hours.

455
00:41:02,118 --> 00:41:05,349
Spooky how the time flies
when one is having fun.

456
00:41:10,118 --> 00:41:12,552
Spooky.

457
00:41:15,478 --> 00:41:17,514
<i>Blood.</i>

458
00:41:17,678 --> 00:41:21,068
<i>I smell blood.</i>

459
00:41:21,238 --> 00:41:24,196
<i>Let me rip you.</i>

460
00:41:24,358 --> 00:41:27,794
<i>Let me kill you.</i>

461
00:41:29,558 --> 00:41:30,957
<i>Kill!</i>

462
00:41:31,838 --> 00:41:33,112
<i>Kill!</i>

463
00:41:33,798 --> 00:41:35,629
- <i>Kill!</i>
- Harry!

464
00:41:35,798 --> 00:41:38,187
- Did you hear it?
- Hear what?

465
00:41:38,358 --> 00:41:41,634
- That voice.
- Voice? What voice?

466
00:41:41,798 --> 00:41:45,586
I heard it first in Lockhart's office.
And then again just...

467
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:47,869
<i>It's time.</i>

468
00:41:48,038 --> 00:41:51,110
It's moving.
I think it's going to kill.

469
00:41:52,038 --> 00:41:55,826
- Kill?
- Harry, wait! Not so fast!

470
00:42:20,358 --> 00:42:22,349
Strange.

471
00:42:22,838 --> 00:42:27,150
- I've never seen spiders act like that.
- I don't like spiders.

472
00:42:31,118 --> 00:42:33,074
What's that?

473
00:42:36,398 --> 00:42:40,755
"The Chamber of Secrets has been
opened. Enemies of the Heir, beware."

474
00:42:40,918 --> 00:42:43,068
It's written in blood.

475
00:42:45,878 --> 00:42:47,948
Oh, no.

476
00:42:52,478 --> 00:42:54,673
It's Filch's cat.

477
00:42:55,158 --> 00:42:57,353
It's Mrs. Norris.

478
00:43:12,758 --> 00:43:15,352
"Enemies of the Heir, beware."

479
00:43:16,798 --> 00:43:19,073
You'll be next, Mudbloods.

480
00:43:19,238 --> 00:43:24,187
What's going on here?
Go on. Make way, make way.

481
00:43:25,598 --> 00:43:27,350
Potter?

482
00:43:27,518 --> 00:43:29,554
What are you...?

483
00:43:32,758 --> 00:43:34,953
Mrs. Norris?

484
00:43:36,398 --> 00:43:40,391
- You've murdered my cat.
- No. No.

485
00:43:40,758 --> 00:43:41,986
I'll kill you.

486
00:43:44,238 --> 00:43:46,957
- I'll kill you!
- Argus!

487
00:43:48,278 --> 00:43:50,348
Argus, I...

488
00:43:52,278 --> 00:43:56,715
Everyone will proceed
to their dormitories immediately.

489
00:43:57,398 --> 00:43:59,309
Everyone except...

490
00:44:00,078 --> 00:44:02,194
...you three.

491
00:44:04,238 --> 00:44:06,877
Ravenclaws, follow me.

492
00:44:08,678 --> 00:44:12,387
She's not dead, Argus.
She has been Petrified.

493
00:44:12,558 --> 00:44:15,277
Thought so.
So unlucky I wasn't there.

494
00:44:15,438 --> 00:44:18,510
I know exactly the countercurse
that could've spared her.

495
00:44:20,758 --> 00:44:23,272
But how she has been Petrified,
I cannot say.

496
00:44:23,518 --> 00:44:26,112
Ask him.
It's him that's done it.

497
00:44:26,278 --> 00:44:28,872
You saw what he wrote on the wall.

498
00:44:29,038 --> 00:44:32,951
It's not true, sir. I swear.
I never touched Mrs. Norris.

499
00:44:33,118 --> 00:44:37,396
- Rubbish.
- Lf I might, headmaster?

500
00:44:37,838 --> 00:44:42,434
Perhaps Potter and his friends were just
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

501
00:44:42,918 --> 00:44:44,749
However...

502
00:44:45,078 --> 00:44:47,911
...the circumstances are suspicious.

503
00:44:48,078 --> 00:44:52,515
I, for one, don't recall
seeing Potter at dinner.

504
00:44:52,678 --> 00:44:54,828
I'm afraid that's my doing, Severus.

505
00:44:54,998 --> 00:44:58,274
You see, Harry was helping me
answer my fan mail.

506
00:44:58,438 --> 00:45:01,589
That's why Ron and I
went looking for him, professor.

507
00:45:01,758 --> 00:45:04,397
We'd just found him when he said...

508
00:45:06,558 --> 00:45:10,233
- Yes, Miss Granger?
- When I said I wasn't hungry.

509
00:45:11,558 --> 00:45:15,392
We were heading back to the common
room when we found Mrs. Norris.

510
00:45:17,638 --> 00:45:22,951
- Innocent until proven guilty, Severus.
- My cat has been Petrified.

511
00:45:23,758 --> 00:45:29,355
- I want to see some punishment!
- We will be able to cure her, Argus.

512
00:45:30,238 --> 00:45:34,834
As I understand it, Madam Sprout
has a very healthy growth of Mandrake.

513
00:45:34,998 --> 00:45:39,230
When matured, a potion will be made
which will revive Mrs. Norris.

514
00:45:39,558 --> 00:45:41,196
And in the meantime...

515
00:45:41,718 --> 00:45:45,552
...I strongly recommend caution...

516
00:45:46,198 --> 00:45:48,109
...to all.

517
00:45:58,678 --> 00:46:01,988
- It's a bit strange, isn't it?
- Strange?

518
00:46:02,158 --> 00:46:04,797
You hear this voice,
a voice only you can hear...

519
00:46:04,958 --> 00:46:09,474
...and then Mrs. Norris turns up
Petrified. It's just strange.

520
00:46:09,638 --> 00:46:12,755
Do you think I should have told them?
Dumbledore and the others, I mean?

521
00:46:12,918 --> 00:46:14,317
Are you mad?

522
00:46:14,478 --> 00:46:19,757
No, Harry. Even in the wizarding world,
hearing voices isn't a good sign.

523
00:46:21,758 --> 00:46:24,033
She's right, you know.

524
00:46:28,198 --> 00:46:30,428
Could I have your attention,
please?

525
00:46:30,958 --> 00:46:36,237
Right. Now, today,
we will be transforming animals...

526
00:46:36,398 --> 00:46:38,673
...into water goblets.

527
00:46:39,558 --> 00:46:41,150
Like so.

528
00:46:41,318 --> 00:46:46,028
One, two, three.
<i>Vera Verto.</i>

529
00:46:49,438 --> 00:46:53,192
Now it's your turn.
Who would like to go first?

530
00:46:53,758 --> 00:46:58,513
Mr. Weasley.
"One, two, three. <i>Vera Verto</i>."

531
00:47:01,958 --> 00:47:03,949
<i>Vera Verto!</i>

532
00:47:09,838 --> 00:47:12,398
That wand needs replacing,
Mr. Weasley.

533
00:47:13,678 --> 00:47:15,748
- Yes, Miss Granger?
- Professor...

534
00:47:15,918 --> 00:47:19,957
...I was wondering if you could tell us
about the Chamber of Secrets.

535
00:47:25,878 --> 00:47:27,072
Very well.

536
00:47:28,518 --> 00:47:30,429
You all know, of course...

537
00:47:30,598 --> 00:47:34,307
...that Hogwarts was founded
over a thousand years ago...

538
00:47:34,478 --> 00:47:38,710
...by the four greatest witches
and wizards of the age:

539
00:47:38,878 --> 00:47:42,473
Godric Gryffindor,
Helga Hufflepuff...

540
00:47:42,638 --> 00:47:48,031
...Rowena Ravenclaw
and Salazar Slytherin.

541
00:47:48,678 --> 00:47:54,435
Now, three of the founders
coexisted quite harmoniously.

542
00:47:54,598 --> 00:47:57,510
- One did not.
- Three guesses who.

543
00:47:58,198 --> 00:48:00,553
Salazar Slytherin wished to be
more selective...

544
00:48:00,718 --> 00:48:03,755
...about the students admitted
to Hogwarts.

545
00:48:03,918 --> 00:48:08,309
He believed magical learning should
be kept within all-magic families.

546
00:48:08,478 --> 00:48:10,514
In other words, pure-bloods.

547
00:48:10,878 --> 00:48:15,998
Unable to sway the others,
he decided to leave the school.

548
00:48:16,798 --> 00:48:18,948
Now, according to legend...

549
00:48:19,118 --> 00:48:22,667
...Slytherin had built
a hidden chamber in this castle...

550
00:48:22,838 --> 00:48:26,353
...known as the Chamber of Secrets.

551
00:48:26,518 --> 00:48:30,750
Though, shortly before departing,
he sealed it...

552
00:48:30,918 --> 00:48:34,877
...until that time when his own
true Heir returned to the school.

553
00:48:35,038 --> 00:48:37,313
The Heir alone...

554
00:48:37,478 --> 00:48:40,038
...would be able to open the Chamber...

555
00:48:40,198 --> 00:48:44,749
...and unleash the horror within,
and by so doing...

556
00:48:44,918 --> 00:48:48,149
...purge the school
of all those who...

557
00:48:48,318 --> 00:48:53,108
...in Slytherin's view,
were unworthy to study magic.

558
00:48:53,718 --> 00:48:55,754
Muggle-borns.

559
00:48:56,758 --> 00:49:00,228
Naturally, the school
has been searched many times.

560
00:49:00,398 --> 00:49:03,708
No such chamber has been found.

561
00:49:04,278 --> 00:49:08,749
Professor? What exactly does legend
tell us lies within the Chamber?

562
00:49:09,558 --> 00:49:12,026
The Chamber is said to be home
to something...

563
00:49:12,198 --> 00:49:15,634
...that only the Heir of Slytherin
can control.

564
00:49:16,238 --> 00:49:19,708
It is said to be the home...

565
00:49:19,878 --> 00:49:21,436
...of a monster.

566
00:49:26,958 --> 00:49:30,473
Do you think it's true? Do you think
there really is a Chamber of Secrets?

567
00:49:30,638 --> 00:49:34,677
Yes. Couldn't you tell? McGonagall's
worried. All the teachers are.

568
00:49:34,838 --> 00:49:38,513
If there really is a Chamber of Secrets,
and it has been opened, that means...

569
00:49:38,678 --> 00:49:42,466
The Heir of Slytherin has returned
to Hogwarts. The question is, who is it?

570
00:49:42,638 --> 00:49:46,836
Let's think. Who do we know who
thinks all Muggle-borns are scum?

571
00:49:46,998 --> 00:49:49,558
- Lf you're talking about Malfoy...
- Of course. You heard him.

572
00:49:49,718 --> 00:49:51,356
"You'll be next, Mudbloods."

573
00:49:51,518 --> 00:49:54,032
I heard him.
But Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?

574
00:49:54,198 --> 00:49:57,235
Maybe Ron's right, Hermione.
I mean, look at his family.

575
00:49:57,398 --> 00:50:00,071
The whole lot of them have been
in Slytherin for centuries.

576
00:50:00,238 --> 00:50:03,514
Crabbe and Goyle must know.
Maybe we could trick them into telling.

577
00:50:03,958 --> 00:50:07,951
Even they aren't that thick.
But there might be another way.

578
00:50:08,118 --> 00:50:09,870
Mind you, it would be difficult.

579
00:50:10,038 --> 00:50:12,950
Not to mention we'd be breaking
about 50 school rules...

580
00:50:13,118 --> 00:50:17,396
...and it'll be dangerous.
Very dangerous.

581
00:50:23,958 --> 00:50:26,313
Here it is.
The Polyjuice Potion.

582
00:50:26,478 --> 00:50:29,072
"Properly brewed, the Polyjuice Potion
allows the drinker...

583
00:50:29,238 --> 00:50:33,311
...to transform himself temporarily
into the physical form of another."

584
00:50:33,478 --> 00:50:37,107
You mean if Harry and I drink that stuff,
we'll turn into Crabbe and Goyle?

585
00:50:37,278 --> 00:50:40,509
- Wicked! Malfoy will tell us anything.
- Exactly.

586
00:50:40,678 --> 00:50:44,387
But it's tricky. I've never seen
a more complicated potion.

587
00:50:44,558 --> 00:50:47,516
- How long will it take to make?
- A month.

588
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:49,277
A month?

589
00:50:49,438 --> 00:50:53,113
But, Hermione,
if Malfoy is the Heir of Slytherin...

590
00:50:53,278 --> 00:50:56,350
...he could attack half
the Muggle-borns in the school by then.

591
00:50:56,518 --> 00:50:58,349
I know.

592
00:50:58,518 --> 00:51:01,237
But it's the only plan we've got.

593
00:51:48,878 --> 00:51:51,472
Another goal for Slytherin!

594
00:51:52,838 --> 00:51:55,989
They lead Gryffindor 90 to 30.

595
00:51:57,118 --> 00:51:58,631
Yeah!

596
00:51:58,878 --> 00:52:00,596
Yeah!

597
00:52:23,838 --> 00:52:26,068
All right there, Scarhead?

598
00:52:31,958 --> 00:52:34,347
Watch yourself, Harry!

599
00:52:34,718 --> 00:52:36,436
Wood, look out!

600
00:52:49,558 --> 00:52:52,277
Blimey! Harry's got himself
a rogue Bludger.

601
00:52:52,438 --> 00:52:54,110
That's been tampered with, that has.

602
00:52:55,118 --> 00:52:56,107
I'll stop it.

603
00:52:56,278 --> 00:53:00,669
No! Even with a proper wand,
it's too risky. You could hit Harry.

604
00:53:24,718 --> 00:53:27,186
Training for the ballet, Potter?

605
00:53:56,918 --> 00:53:59,034
You'll never catch me, Potter.

606
00:55:26,118 --> 00:55:27,153
Let's go.

607
00:55:27,318 --> 00:55:32,312
<i>Harry Potter has caught the Snitch.</i>
<i>Gryffindor wins!</i>

608
00:55:38,358 --> 00:55:40,314
<i>Finite Incantatem!</i>

609
00:55:47,118 --> 00:55:48,392
- Thank you.
- Are you okay?

610
00:55:48,558 --> 00:55:50,549
No. I think my arm is broken.

611
00:55:50,718 --> 00:55:54,347
Not to worry, Harry. I will fix
that arm of yours straightaway.

612
00:55:54,518 --> 00:55:57,351
- Not you.
- Boy doesn't know what he's saying.

613
00:55:57,518 --> 00:56:00,908
This won't hurt a bit.

614
00:56:06,758 --> 00:56:09,636
<i>Brackium Emendo!</i>

615
00:56:17,358 --> 00:56:20,316
Yes, well,
that can sometimes happen...

616
00:56:20,478 --> 00:56:22,628
...but the point is...

617
00:56:23,958 --> 00:56:27,917
...you can no longer feel any pain, and,
very clearly, the bones are not broken.

618
00:56:28,078 --> 00:56:30,638
Broken? There's no bones left.

619
00:56:32,278 --> 00:56:34,155
Much more flexible, though.

620
00:56:36,518 --> 00:56:40,272
Mr. Malfoy, stop making such a fuss.
You can go. Out of my way.

621
00:56:40,438 --> 00:56:42,315
Should have been brought
straight to me.

622
00:56:42,478 --> 00:56:44,912
I can mend bones in a heartbeat,
but growing them back...

623
00:56:45,078 --> 00:56:46,511
You will be able to, won't you?

624
00:56:46,678 --> 00:56:49,670
I'll be able to, certainly.
But it'll be painful.

625
00:56:50,278 --> 00:56:54,749
You're in for a rough night, Potter.
Regrowing bones is a nasty business.

626
00:56:57,558 --> 00:57:00,436
What do you expect?
Pumpkin juice?

627
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:08,470
<i>Kill.</i>

628
00:57:09,278 --> 00:57:10,757
<i>Kill.</i>

629
00:57:15,918 --> 00:57:18,990
<i>Time to kill.</i>

630
00:57:24,878 --> 00:57:25,867
Hello.

631
00:57:27,598 --> 00:57:28,587
Dobby?

632
00:57:28,758 --> 00:57:30,988
Harry Potter should have listened
to Dobby.

633
00:57:31,438 --> 00:57:34,987
Harry Potter should have gone back home
when he missed the train.

634
00:57:35,158 --> 00:57:39,595
It was you. You stopped the barrier
from letting Ron and me through.

635
00:57:39,878 --> 00:57:42,711
Indeed. Yes, sir.

636
00:57:43,678 --> 00:57:48,513
- You nearly got Ron and me expelled.
- At least you would be away from here.

637
00:57:48,678 --> 00:57:51,238
Harry Potter must go home.

638
00:57:51,398 --> 00:57:54,834
Dobby thought his Bludger would be
enough to make Harry Potter see...

639
00:57:54,998 --> 00:57:58,229
Your Bludger? You made
that Bludger chase after me?

640
00:57:58,398 --> 00:58:01,834
Dobby feels most aggrieved, sir.

641
00:58:01,998 --> 00:58:05,468
Dobby had to iron his hands.

642
00:58:07,598 --> 00:58:11,989
You better clear off before my bones
come back, or I might strangle you.

643
00:58:14,518 --> 00:58:16,429
Dobby is used to death threats, sir.

644
00:58:16,598 --> 00:58:19,510
Dobby gets them five times a day
at home.

645
00:58:19,678 --> 00:58:22,351
I don't suppose you could tell me
why you're trying to kill me?

646
00:58:22,638 --> 00:58:26,347
Not kill you, sir.
Never kill you.

647
00:58:26,518 --> 00:58:29,715
Dobby remembers how it was
before Harry Potter triumphed...

648
00:58:29,878 --> 00:58:32,870
...over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.

649
00:58:33,038 --> 00:58:36,587
We house-elves were
treated like vermin, sir.

650
00:58:36,758 --> 00:58:41,957
Of course, Dobby is still
treated like vermin.

651
00:58:50,918 --> 00:58:53,432
Why do you wear that thing, Dobby?

652
00:58:53,598 --> 00:58:58,513
This, sir? It is a mark
of the house-elf's enslavement.

653
00:58:58,678 --> 00:59:03,593
Dobby can only be freed if his master
presents him with clothes.

654
00:59:05,638 --> 00:59:06,957
Listen.

655
00:59:07,118 --> 00:59:08,597
Listen!

656
00:59:08,758 --> 00:59:12,307
Terrible things are
about to happen at Hogwarts.

657
00:59:12,918 --> 00:59:15,273
Harry Potter must not stay here...

658
00:59:15,438 --> 00:59:19,795
...now that history
is to repeat itself.

659
00:59:19,958 --> 00:59:23,268
Repeat itself? You mean
this has happened before?

660
00:59:23,438 --> 00:59:25,349
I shouldn't have said that.

661
00:59:28,918 --> 00:59:31,955
- Bad Dobby! Bad!
- Stop it!

662
00:59:32,118 --> 00:59:33,710
Stop it, Dobby!

663
00:59:35,318 --> 00:59:38,993
Tell me. When did this happen before?
Who's doing it now?

664
00:59:39,158 --> 00:59:44,152
Dobby cannot say, sir. Dobby
only wants Harry Potter to be safe.

665
00:59:44,318 --> 00:59:47,116
No, Dobby. Tell me.
Who is it?

666
00:59:58,478 --> 00:59:59,513
Put him here.

667
01:00:03,918 --> 01:00:06,716
- What happened?
- There's been another attack.

668
01:00:06,878 --> 01:00:12,430
I think he's been Petrified,
Madam Pomfrey.

669
01:00:13,198 --> 01:00:17,714
Look. Perhaps he managed
to take a picture of his attacker.

670
01:00:25,478 --> 01:00:28,117
What can this mean, Albus?

671
01:00:28,278 --> 01:00:30,155
It means...

672
01:00:30,518 --> 01:00:33,157
...that our students
are in great danger.

673
01:00:33,318 --> 01:00:36,594
- What should I tell the staff?
- The truth.

674
01:00:36,838 --> 01:00:40,467
Tell them Hogwarts
is no longer safe.

675
01:00:40,798 --> 01:00:43,631
It is as we feared, Minerva.

676
01:00:43,878 --> 01:00:48,235
The Chamber of Secrets
has indeed been opened again.

677
01:00:50,958 --> 01:00:54,917
Again? You mean the Chamber
of Secrets has been opened before?

678
01:00:55,078 --> 01:00:57,717
Of course.
Don't you see?

679
01:00:57,878 --> 01:01:00,756
Lucius Malfoy must have opened it
when he was at school here.

680
01:01:01,358 --> 01:01:03,826
- Now he's taught Draco how to do it.
- Maybe.

681
01:01:03,998 --> 01:01:07,035
We'll have to wait for
the Polyjuice Potion to know for sure.

682
01:01:07,198 --> 01:01:10,986
Enlighten me. Why are we brewing
this potion in broad daylight...

683
01:01:11,158 --> 01:01:14,946
...in the middle of the girls' lavatory?
Don't you think we'll get caught?

684
01:01:15,798 --> 01:01:18,358
No. No one ever comes in here.

685
01:01:19,158 --> 01:01:21,592
- Why?
- Moaning Myrtle.

686
01:01:21,758 --> 01:01:23,635
Who?

687
01:01:24,118 --> 01:01:25,710
Moaning Myrtle.

688
01:01:25,998 --> 01:01:29,195
- Who's Moaning Myrtle?
- I'm Moaning Myrtle.

689
01:01:34,878 --> 01:01:37,153
I wouldn't expect you to know me.

690
01:01:37,318 --> 01:01:40,230
Who would ever talk
about ugly, miserable...

691
01:01:40,398 --> 01:01:43,629
...moping Moaning Myrtle?

692
01:01:50,558 --> 01:01:52,594
She's a little sensitive.

693
01:01:56,918 --> 01:01:58,795
Gather round!

694
01:01:59,118 --> 01:02:03,908
Gather round.
Can everybody see me?

695
01:02:04,078 --> 01:02:07,070
Can you all hear me?

696
01:02:07,718 --> 01:02:08,992
Excellent.

697
01:02:09,478 --> 01:02:13,027
In light of the dark events
of recent weeks...

698
01:02:13,198 --> 01:02:17,669
...Professor Dumbledore has granted me
permission to start this Dueling Club...

699
01:02:17,838 --> 01:02:22,309
...to train you all up in case
you ever need to defend yourselves...

700
01:02:22,558 --> 01:02:24,992
...as I myself have done
on countless occasions.

701
01:02:25,198 --> 01:02:28,713
For full details,
see my published works.

702
01:02:33,238 --> 01:02:36,230
Let me introduce my assistant...

703
01:02:36,398 --> 01:02:38,912
...Professor Snape.

704
01:02:42,118 --> 01:02:44,791
He has sportingly agreed to help
with a short demonstration.

705
01:02:44,958 --> 01:02:46,914
I don't want any of you
youngsters to worry.

706
01:02:47,078 --> 01:02:51,788
You'll still have your Potions master
when I'm through with him. Never fear.

707
01:03:06,798 --> 01:03:08,356
One.

708
01:03:08,518 --> 01:03:09,507
Two.

709
01:03:10,278 --> 01:03:13,190
- Three!
- <i>Expelliarmus!</i>

710
01:03:21,438 --> 01:03:23,998
- Do you think he's all right?
- Who cares?

711
01:03:24,158 --> 01:03:26,991
An excellent idea to show them that,
Professor Snape...

712
01:03:27,158 --> 01:03:31,515
...but if you don't mind me saying, it was
obvious what you were about to do.

713
01:03:31,678 --> 01:03:34,795
If I had wanted to stop you,
it would have been only too easy.

714
01:03:34,958 --> 01:03:38,268
Perhaps it would be prudent
to first teach the students...

715
01:03:38,438 --> 01:03:42,750
...to block unfriendly spells,
professor.

716
01:03:44,438 --> 01:03:46,747
An excellent suggestion,
Professor Snape.

717
01:03:47,958 --> 01:03:52,031
Let's have a volunteer pair.
Potter, Weasley, how about you?

718
01:03:52,198 --> 01:03:55,554
Weasley's wand causes devastation
with the simplest spells.

719
01:03:55,958 --> 01:03:59,507
We'll be sending Potter
to the hospital wing in a matchbox.

720
01:03:59,678 --> 01:04:03,591
Might I suggest someone
from my own house?

721
01:04:04,798 --> 01:04:07,187
Malfoy, perhaps?

722
01:04:14,398 --> 01:04:16,787
- Good luck, Potter.
- Thank you, sir.

723
01:04:24,438 --> 01:04:26,349
Wands at the ready.

724
01:04:26,918 --> 01:04:29,796
- Scared, Potter?
- You wish.

725
01:04:39,798 --> 01:04:41,436
On the count of three...

726
01:04:41,598 --> 01:04:45,750
...cast your charms to disarm
your opponent. Only to disarm.

727
01:04:45,918 --> 01:04:49,308
We don't want any accidents here.
One.

728
01:04:51,038 --> 01:04:53,472
- Two.
- <i>Everte Statum!</i>

729
01:05:04,638 --> 01:05:06,788
<i>Rictusempra!</i>

730
01:05:17,318 --> 01:05:19,036
I said disarm only.

731
01:05:19,198 --> 01:05:21,109
<i>Serpensortia!</i>

732
01:05:29,438 --> 01:05:32,111
Don't move, Potter.
I'll get rid of it for you.

733
01:05:32,278 --> 01:05:37,477
Allow me, Professor Snape.
<i>Alarte Ascendare!</i>

734
01:06:18,278 --> 01:06:20,838
<i>Vipera Evanesca.</i>

735
01:06:27,278 --> 01:06:29,553
What are you playing at?

736
01:06:41,798 --> 01:06:44,392
You're a Parselmouth?
Why didn't you tell us?

737
01:06:44,558 --> 01:06:46,708
- I'm a what?
- You can talk to snakes.

738
01:06:46,878 --> 01:06:51,998
I know. I accidentally set a python
on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once.

739
01:06:52,158 --> 01:06:55,946
Once. But so what?
I bet loads of people here can do it.

740
01:06:56,118 --> 01:06:59,713
No, they can't.
It's not a very common gift, Harry.

741
01:07:00,198 --> 01:07:01,836
This is bad.

742
01:07:01,998 --> 01:07:05,593
What's bad? If I hadn't told
that snake not to attack Justin...

743
01:07:05,758 --> 01:07:09,068
- That's what you said to it.
- You were there. You heard me.

744
01:07:09,238 --> 01:07:12,947
I heard you speaking Parseltongue.
Snake language.

745
01:07:13,118 --> 01:07:15,871
I spoke a different language?

746
01:07:16,918 --> 01:07:19,193
But I didn't realize...

747
01:07:19,358 --> 01:07:22,031
How can I speak a language
without knowing I can?

748
01:07:22,198 --> 01:07:26,032
I don't know, but it sounded like you
were egging the snake on or something.

749
01:07:26,198 --> 01:07:27,836
Harry, listen to me.

750
01:07:28,238 --> 01:07:30,991
There's a reason the symbol
of Slytherin house is a serpent.

751
01:07:31,158 --> 01:07:35,470
Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth.
He could talk to snakes too.

752
01:07:35,718 --> 01:07:36,707
Exactly.

753
01:07:36,878 --> 01:07:40,109
Now the whole school's gonna think
you're his great-great-great grandson.

754
01:07:40,278 --> 01:07:42,189
But I'm not.

755
01:07:44,798 --> 01:07:46,675
I can't be.

756
01:07:47,758 --> 01:07:49,714
He lived a thousand years ago.

757
01:07:49,878 --> 01:07:52,950
For all we know, you could be.

758
01:08:21,838 --> 01:08:24,113
I'll see you back in the common room.

759
01:08:39,838 --> 01:08:43,956
<i>I want blood.</i>

760
01:08:46,718 --> 01:08:51,508
<i>They all must die.</i>

761
01:08:52,078 --> 01:08:53,989
<i>Kill.</i>

762
01:08:54,638 --> 01:08:56,629
<i>Kill.</i>

763
01:08:57,398 --> 01:08:59,593
<i>Kill.</i>

764
01:08:59,918 --> 01:09:03,797
<i>Time to kill.</i>

765
01:09:36,598 --> 01:09:38,429
Caught in the act.

766
01:09:38,598 --> 01:09:40,475
I'll have you out this time, Potter.

767
01:09:40,958 --> 01:09:43,347
Mark my words.

768
01:09:43,518 --> 01:09:47,591
No. Mr. Filch! You don't understand...

769
01:10:13,238 --> 01:10:15,115
Professor...

770
01:10:15,278 --> 01:10:16,597
...I swear I didn't.

771
01:10:16,798 --> 01:10:19,870
This is out of my hands, Potter.

772
01:10:29,118 --> 01:10:31,678
Professor Dumbledore
will be waiting for you.

773
01:10:40,238 --> 01:10:42,706
Sherbet Lemon.

774
01:11:15,278 --> 01:11:17,314
Professor Dumbledore?

775
01:11:33,118 --> 01:11:35,712
Bee in your bonnet, Potter?

776
01:11:38,478 --> 01:11:42,835
I was just wondering
if you put me in the right house.

777
01:11:42,998 --> 01:11:48,231
Yes. You were particularly
difficult to place.

778
01:11:48,398 --> 01:11:51,788
But I stand by what I said last year.

779
01:11:51,958 --> 01:11:55,189
You would have done well in Slytherin.

780
01:11:55,358 --> 01:11:56,632
You're wrong.

781
01:12:24,718 --> 01:12:26,071
Harry?

782
01:12:26,438 --> 01:12:28,588
Professor.

783
01:12:28,758 --> 01:12:32,387
Your bird...
There was nothing I could do.

784
01:12:32,958 --> 01:12:36,155
- He just caught fire.
- And about time too.

785
01:12:36,958 --> 01:12:39,188
He's been looking dreadful for days.

786
01:12:39,358 --> 01:12:41,269
Pity you had to see him
on a burning day.

787
01:12:43,118 --> 01:12:46,235
Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry.

788
01:12:46,398 --> 01:12:49,595
They burst into flame
when it is time for them to die...

789
01:12:49,758 --> 01:12:51,794
...and then they are...

790
01:12:51,958 --> 01:12:54,870
...reborn from the ashes.

791
01:13:02,918 --> 01:13:05,432
Fascinating creatures, phoenixes.

792
01:13:05,878 --> 01:13:09,587
They can carry immensely heavy loads.

793
01:13:09,758 --> 01:13:12,477
Their tears have healing powers.

794
01:13:14,998 --> 01:13:17,910
Professor Dumbledore, sir!
Wait! Listen!

795
01:13:18,878 --> 01:13:20,914
Professor Dumbledore, sir,
it wasn't Harry.

796
01:13:22,038 --> 01:13:24,791
I'd be prepared to swear it
in front of the Ministry of Magic.

797
01:13:26,198 --> 01:13:27,995
Relax.

798
01:13:28,718 --> 01:13:30,595
I do not believe...

799
01:13:30,758 --> 01:13:34,114
...that Harry attacked anyone.
- Of course you don't.

800
01:13:37,728 --> 01:13:40,196
Right. Well, I'll...

801
01:13:40,368 --> 01:13:43,360
- I'll just wait outside, then.
- Yes.

802
01:13:46,888 --> 01:13:50,403
- You don't think it was me, professor?
- No, Harry.

803
01:13:50,568 --> 01:13:52,957
I do not think it was you.

804
01:13:53,968 --> 01:13:55,686
But I must ask you...

805
01:13:56,248 --> 01:14:00,161
...is there something
you wish to tell me?

806
01:14:06,368 --> 01:14:08,199
No, sir.

807
01:14:08,368 --> 01:14:09,801
Nothing.

808
01:14:12,688 --> 01:14:14,758
Very well, then.

809
01:14:14,928 --> 01:14:16,646
Off you go.

810
01:14:53,048 --> 01:14:56,438
Everything's set. We just need a bit
of who you're changing into.

811
01:14:56,608 --> 01:14:58,246
Crabbe and Goyle.

812
01:14:58,408 --> 01:15:01,081
We also need to make sure
that the real Crabbe and Goyle...

813
01:15:01,248 --> 01:15:04,320
...can't burst in on us
while we're interrogating Malfoy.

814
01:15:04,648 --> 01:15:07,242
- How?
- I've got it all worked out.

815
01:15:07,408 --> 01:15:09,876
I filled these
with a simple Sleeping Draught.

816
01:15:10,048 --> 01:15:12,687
Simple, but powerful.

817
01:15:12,888 --> 01:15:14,958
Now, once they're asleep...

818
01:15:15,128 --> 01:15:18,200
...hide them in the broomstick cupboard
and pull out a few of their hairs...

819
01:15:18,368 --> 01:15:20,165
...and put on their uniforms.

820
01:15:20,328 --> 01:15:23,479
- Whose hair are you ripping out, then?
- I've already got mine.

821
01:15:23,648 --> 01:15:26,685
Millicent Bulstrode. Slytherin.

822
01:15:26,848 --> 01:15:28,918
I got this off her robes.

823
01:15:29,088 --> 01:15:31,602
I'm going to go check
on the Polyjuice Potion.

824
01:15:31,768 --> 01:15:34,362
Make sure that Crabbe and Goyle
find these.

825
01:15:46,008 --> 01:15:48,283
Ron, maybe I should do it.

826
01:15:48,448 --> 01:15:50,404
Yeah. Right.

827
01:15:52,528 --> 01:15:54,280
<i>Wingardium Leviosa.</i>

828
01:16:04,008 --> 01:16:05,566
Cool.

829
01:16:27,768 --> 01:16:29,520
How thick could you get?

830
01:16:29,688 --> 01:16:31,565
Come on, let's get them.

831
01:16:34,128 --> 01:16:37,962
We'll have exactly one hour
before we change back into ourselves.

832
01:16:45,808 --> 01:16:47,685
Add the hairs.

833
01:16:52,048 --> 01:16:53,720
Essence of Crabbe.

834
01:16:53,888 --> 01:16:55,685
Cheers.

835
01:17:04,048 --> 01:17:06,357
I think I'm gonna be sick.

836
01:17:09,168 --> 01:17:10,920
Me too.

837
01:17:53,968 --> 01:17:55,640
Harry?

838
01:17:56,088 --> 01:17:57,567
Ron.

839
01:17:58,288 --> 01:18:00,358
Bloody hell!

840
01:18:01,128 --> 01:18:03,323
We still sound like ourselves.

841
01:18:03,488 --> 01:18:05,160
You need to sound more like Crabbe.

842
01:18:06,288 --> 01:18:08,483
- Bloody hell.
- Excellent.

843
01:18:08,808 --> 01:18:11,197
- But where's Hermione?
- I...

844
01:18:11,368 --> 01:18:14,246
I don't think I'm going.
You go on without me.

845
01:18:14,408 --> 01:18:16,046
Hermione, are you okay?

846
01:18:16,208 --> 01:18:18,927
Just go. You're wasting time.

847
01:18:20,928 --> 01:18:22,520
Come on.

848
01:18:25,888 --> 01:18:29,085
I think the Slytherin common room's
this way.

849
01:18:31,968 --> 01:18:34,323
Excuse me.

850
01:18:36,048 --> 01:18:37,879
What are you doing d...?

851
01:18:38,048 --> 01:18:40,039
I mean, what are you doing down here?

852
01:18:41,888 --> 01:18:44,482
I happen to be a school prefect.

853
01:18:44,648 --> 01:18:48,926
You, on the other hand, have no business
wandering the corridors at night.

854
01:18:49,488 --> 01:18:51,240
What are your names again?

855
01:18:51,408 --> 01:18:55,242
- I'm...
- Crabbe, Goyle, where have you been?

856
01:18:55,408 --> 01:18:58,320
Pigging out in the Great Hall
all this time?

857
01:18:59,768 --> 01:19:01,963
Why are you wearing glasses?

858
01:19:02,768 --> 01:19:05,487
- Reading.
- Reading?

859
01:19:06,608 --> 01:19:08,803
I didn't know you could read.

860
01:19:11,568 --> 01:19:13,559
And what are you doing down here,
Weasley?

861
01:19:13,728 --> 01:19:15,684
Mind your attitude, Malfoy.

862
01:19:24,128 --> 01:19:26,039
Well, sit down.

863
01:19:28,728 --> 01:19:32,403
You'd never know the Weasleys
were pure-bloods, the way they behave.

864
01:19:32,608 --> 01:19:36,283
They're an embarrassment
to the wizarding world. All of them.

865
01:19:37,088 --> 01:19:39,283
What's wrong with you, Crabbe?

866
01:19:41,408 --> 01:19:43,080
Stomachache.

867
01:19:45,008 --> 01:19:49,638
I'm surprised the <i>Daily Prophet</i>
hasn't done a report on all these attacks.

868
01:19:49,808 --> 01:19:52,163
I suppose Dumbledore
is trying to hush it all up.

869
01:19:52,448 --> 01:19:54,723
Father always said Dumbledore
was the worst thing...

870
01:19:54,888 --> 01:19:58,517
...that ever happened to this place.
- You're wrong!

871
01:20:05,728 --> 01:20:06,843
What?

872
01:20:07,008 --> 01:20:10,523
You think there's someone here
who's worse than Dumbledore?

873
01:20:10,688 --> 01:20:12,997
Well? Do you?

874
01:20:13,528 --> 01:20:15,325
Harry Potter?

875
01:20:21,608 --> 01:20:22,961
Good one, Goyle.

876
01:20:23,128 --> 01:20:24,607
You're absolutely right.

877
01:20:25,248 --> 01:20:27,000
Saint Potter.

878
01:20:27,968 --> 01:20:30,641
And people actually think
that he's the Heir of Slytherin?

879
01:20:34,248 --> 01:20:36,762
But then you must have some idea
who's behind it all.

880
01:20:36,928 --> 01:20:40,443
You know I don't, Goyle.
I told you yesterday.

881
01:20:41,408 --> 01:20:43,797
How many times do I have to tell you?

882
01:20:44,768 --> 01:20:46,520
Is this yours?

883
01:20:50,808 --> 01:20:53,083
But my father did say this:

884
01:20:53,448 --> 01:20:56,246
It's been 50 years
since the Chamber was opened.

885
01:20:56,408 --> 01:21:00,606
He wouldn't tell me who opened it.
Only that they were expelled.

886
01:21:00,888 --> 01:21:05,359
The last time the Chamber of Secrets
was opened, a Mudblood died.

887
01:21:05,528 --> 01:21:09,646
So it's only a matter of time
before one of them is killed this time.

888
01:21:10,208 --> 01:21:11,960
As for me...

889
01:21:12,128 --> 01:21:14,198
...I hope it's Granger.

890
01:21:14,368 --> 01:21:16,484
What's the matter with you two?

891
01:21:16,648 --> 01:21:19,037
You're acting very odd.

892
01:21:19,208 --> 01:21:21,324
It's his stomachache.

893
01:21:21,488 --> 01:21:23,479
Calm down.

894
01:21:27,488 --> 01:21:29,399
Scar.

895
01:21:32,848 --> 01:21:34,201
Hair.

896
01:21:40,128 --> 01:21:42,403
Hey! Where are you going?

897
01:21:45,288 --> 01:21:46,516
That was close.

898
01:21:46,688 --> 01:21:48,997
Hermione, come out.
We've got loads to tell you.

899
01:21:49,168 --> 01:21:50,965
Go away.

900
01:21:51,448 --> 01:21:55,157
Wait till you see. It's awful.

901
01:21:57,048 --> 01:21:58,720
Hermione?

902
01:21:58,888 --> 01:22:00,446
Are you okay?

903
01:22:02,408 --> 01:22:04,126
Do you remember me telling you...

904
01:22:04,288 --> 01:22:07,325
...that the Polyjuice Potion
was only for human transformations?

905
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:11,447
It was cat hair I plucked off
Millicent Bulstrode's robes.

906
01:22:13,728 --> 01:22:15,207
Look at my face.

907
01:22:16,288 --> 01:22:18,643
Look at your tail.

908
01:22:24,928 --> 01:22:26,327
Have you spoken to Hermione?

909
01:22:26,488 --> 01:22:28,922
She should be out of hospital
in a few days...

910
01:22:29,088 --> 01:22:31,807
...when she stops coughing up fur balls.

911
01:22:36,368 --> 01:22:38,040
What's this?

912
01:22:42,448 --> 01:22:43,483
Yuck!

913
01:22:43,648 --> 01:22:46,321
Looks like Moaning Myrtle's
flooded the bathroom.

914
01:23:01,888 --> 01:23:05,847
- Come to throw something else at me?
- Why would I throw something at you?

915
01:23:06,248 --> 01:23:10,161
Don't ask me. Here I am,
minding my own business...

916
01:23:10,328 --> 01:23:13,798
...and someone thinks it's funny
to throw a book at me.

917
01:23:14,008 --> 01:23:16,761
But it can't hurt if someone
throws something at you.

918
01:23:16,928 --> 01:23:19,237
I mean, it'll just go
right through you.

919
01:23:20,248 --> 01:23:24,446
Sure! Let's all throw books at Myrtle
because she can't feel it.

920
01:23:24,608 --> 01:23:27,122
Ten points
if you get it through her stomach!

921
01:23:27,288 --> 01:23:30,644
Fifty points if it goes through her head!

922
01:23:31,128 --> 01:23:35,360
- But who threw it at you, anyway?
- I don't know. I didn't see them.

923
01:23:35,688 --> 01:23:39,761
I was just sitting in the U-bend,
thinking about death...

924
01:23:39,968 --> 01:23:43,483
...and it fell through the top
of my head.

925
01:24:12,408 --> 01:24:14,797
"Tom Marvolo Riddle."

926
01:24:43,448 --> 01:24:45,678
My name...

927
01:24:45,848 --> 01:24:48,646
...is Harry...

928
01:24:50,208 --> 01:24:52,244
...Potter.

929
01:25:04,928 --> 01:25:09,877
Do you know anything...

930
01:25:10,688 --> 01:25:17,082
...about the Chamber of Secrets?

931
01:25:26,808 --> 01:25:28,639
Can you...

932
01:25:29,848 --> 01:25:32,043
...tell me?

933
01:26:31,768 --> 01:26:35,044
Excuse me. Could you tell me
what's going on here?

934
01:26:38,368 --> 01:26:40,598
Are you Tom Riddle?

935
01:26:40,768 --> 01:26:42,486
Hello, can you hear me?

936
01:27:02,208 --> 01:27:03,880
Riddle!

937
01:27:04,448 --> 01:27:05,927
Come.

938
01:27:06,088 --> 01:27:07,999
Professor Dumbledore.

939
01:27:10,088 --> 01:27:12,158
Dumbledore?

940
01:27:13,408 --> 01:27:16,764
It is not wise to be wandering around
this late hour, Tom.

941
01:27:16,928 --> 01:27:20,125
Yes, professor. I suppose I...

942
01:27:20,288 --> 01:27:22,358
I had to see for myself
if the rumors were true.

943
01:27:22,928 --> 01:27:25,726
I'm afraid they are, Tom.
They are true.

944
01:27:25,888 --> 01:27:28,607
About the school as well?
I don't have a home to go to.

945
01:27:28,768 --> 01:27:31,487
They wouldn't really close Hogwarts,
would they, professor?

946
01:27:31,648 --> 01:27:34,082
I understand, Tom, but I'm afraid...

947
01:27:34,848 --> 01:27:37,646
...Headmaster Dippet
may have no choice.

948
01:27:37,808 --> 01:27:42,120
Sir, if it all stopped,
if the person responsible was caught...

949
01:27:44,288 --> 01:27:46,324
Is there something...

950
01:27:47,208 --> 01:27:49,119
...you wish to tell me?

951
01:27:50,288 --> 01:27:52,722
No, sir. Nothing.

952
01:27:59,208 --> 01:28:02,120
Very well, then. Off you go.

953
01:28:02,288 --> 01:28:04,085
Good night, sir.

954
01:28:38,728 --> 01:28:41,526
- Let's get you out of there.
- Evening, Hagrid.

955
01:28:41,848 --> 01:28:46,000
I'm going to have to turn you in. I don't
think you meant it to kill anyone...

956
01:28:46,168 --> 01:28:48,363
You can't. You don't understand.

957
01:28:48,568 --> 01:28:51,560
The dead girl's parents will be here
tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do...

958
01:28:51,728 --> 01:28:54,526
...is make sure the thing that killed
their daughter is slaughtered.

959
01:28:54,768 --> 01:28:57,760
It wasn't him.
Aragog never killed no one. Never.

960
01:28:58,088 --> 01:29:00,158
Monsters don't make good pets, Hagrid.

961
01:29:00,328 --> 01:29:01,886
- Now, stand aside.
- No!

962
01:29:02,048 --> 01:29:03,925
- Stand aside, Hagrid.
- No!

963
01:29:04,088 --> 01:29:05,646
<i>Cistem Aperio!</i>

964
01:29:12,328 --> 01:29:14,558
<i>Arania Exumai!</i>

965
01:29:15,408 --> 01:29:16,807
Aragog!

966
01:29:16,968 --> 01:29:18,162
Aragog!

967
01:29:18,688 --> 01:29:20,007
I can't let you go.

968
01:29:20,528 --> 01:29:23,679
They'll have your wand for this, Hagrid.
You'll be expelled.

969
01:29:26,128 --> 01:29:27,925
Hagrid!

970
01:29:56,728 --> 01:30:00,687
It was Hagrid. Hagrid opened
the Chamber of Secrets 50 years ago.

971
01:30:00,848 --> 01:30:03,681
It can't be Hagrid.
It just can't be.

972
01:30:03,848 --> 01:30:07,761
We don't even know this Tom Riddle.
He sounds like a dirty, rotten snitch.

973
01:30:07,928 --> 01:30:11,284
The monster had killed somebody, Ron.
What would any of us have done?

974
01:30:11,568 --> 01:30:15,356
Look, Hagrid's our friend. Why don't
we just go and ask him about it?

975
01:30:15,568 --> 01:30:18,128
That would be a cheerful visit.
"Hello, Hagrid.

976
01:30:18,288 --> 01:30:21,963
Tell us, have you been setting anything
mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?"

977
01:30:22,128 --> 01:30:25,200
Mad and hairy? You wouldn't be talking
about me, now, would you?

978
01:30:25,488 --> 01:30:26,477
No.

979
01:30:30,808 --> 01:30:32,366
What's that you've got, Hagrid?

980
01:30:32,808 --> 01:30:37,165
It's Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent.
For the Mandrakes, you know.

981
01:30:37,328 --> 01:30:40,843
Now, according to Professor Sprout,
they've still got a bit of growing to do.

982
01:30:41,008 --> 01:30:44,364
But once their acne's cleared up,
we'll chop them up and stew them...

983
01:30:44,528 --> 01:30:47,679
...and then we'll get those people
down at the hospital un-Petrified.

984
01:30:49,088 --> 01:30:51,841
In the meantime, though, you three...

985
01:30:52,008 --> 01:30:55,045
...had best be looking after yourselves.
All right?

986
01:31:02,608 --> 01:31:04,439
Hello, Neville.

987
01:31:05,488 --> 01:31:07,877
Harry, I don't know who did it,
but you'd better come.

988
01:31:08,248 --> 01:31:09,886
Come on!

989
01:31:31,528 --> 01:31:35,362
It had to be a Gryffindor.
Nobody else knows our password.

990
01:31:35,528 --> 01:31:37,678
Unless it wasn't a student.

991
01:31:37,848 --> 01:31:41,124
Whoever it was, they must have
been looking for something.

992
01:31:41,288 --> 01:31:42,641
And they found it.

993
01:31:43,368 --> 01:31:45,757
Tom Riddle's diary is gone.

994
01:31:47,288 --> 01:31:48,516
All right, listen up.

995
01:31:48,688 --> 01:31:51,486
We play our game,
Hufflepuff doesn't stand a chance.

996
01:31:51,648 --> 01:31:53,445
We're stronger, quicker and smarter.

997
01:31:53,608 --> 01:31:56,486
Not to mention they're dead scared
that Harry will Petrify them...

998
01:31:56,648 --> 01:32:00,004
...if they fly anywhere near him.
- Well, that too.

999
01:32:01,168 --> 01:32:02,647
Professor McGonagall.

1000
01:32:02,808 --> 01:32:05,720
- This match has been canceled.
- We can't cancel Quidditch.

1001
01:32:05,888 --> 01:32:10,643
Silence, Wood. You and your teammates
will go to Gryffindor Tower. Now.

1002
01:32:10,808 --> 01:32:13,368
Potter, you and I will find Mr. Weasley.

1003
01:32:13,728 --> 01:32:16,162
There's something
the both of you have to see.

1004
01:32:18,168 --> 01:32:21,604
I warn you.
This could be a wee bit of a shock.

1005
01:32:29,648 --> 01:32:30,797
Hermione!

1006
01:32:30,968 --> 01:32:32,686
She was found near the library...

1007
01:32:33,888 --> 01:32:35,844
...along with this.

1008
01:32:37,248 --> 01:32:39,967
Does it mean anything to either of you?

1009
01:32:40,128 --> 01:32:41,527
No.

1010
01:32:55,168 --> 01:32:57,398
Could I have your attention, please?

1011
01:32:57,568 --> 01:33:02,961
Because of recent events, these new
rules will be put into effect immediately:

1012
01:33:03,288 --> 01:33:08,203
"All students will return to their house
common rooms by 6:00 every evening.

1013
01:33:08,368 --> 01:33:12,281
All students will be escorted
to each lesson by a teacher.

1014
01:33:12,448 --> 01:33:15,326
No exceptions."

1015
01:33:15,968 --> 01:33:17,924
I should tell you this:

1016
01:33:18,088 --> 01:33:22,047
Unless the culprit
behind these attacks is caught...

1017
01:33:22,568 --> 01:33:25,605
...it is likely the school will be closed.

1018
01:33:36,648 --> 01:33:39,481
We've got to talk to Hagrid, Ron.
I can't believe it's him...

1019
01:33:39,648 --> 01:33:41,843
...but if he did set the monster loose
last time...

1020
01:33:42,008 --> 01:33:45,045
...he'll know how to get inside
the Chamber of Secrets. That's a start.

1021
01:33:45,208 --> 01:33:46,402
But you heard McGonagall.

1022
01:33:46,568 --> 01:33:49,719
We're not allowed to leave
the tower except for class.

1023
01:33:50,168 --> 01:33:52,523
I think it's time to get
my dad's old cloak out again.

1024
01:34:05,608 --> 01:34:07,246
Who's there?

1025
01:34:10,888 --> 01:34:12,401
Hello?

1026
01:34:13,008 --> 01:34:14,487
Hello?

1027
01:34:15,608 --> 01:34:19,726
- What's that for?
- Nothing. I was expecting...

1028
01:34:19,888 --> 01:34:23,597
It doesn't matter. Come on in.
I just made a pot of tea.

1029
01:34:26,248 --> 01:34:28,443
Hagrid, are you okay?

1030
01:34:28,608 --> 01:34:31,361
I'm fine. I'm all right.

1031
01:34:32,288 --> 01:34:33,926
Did you hear about Hermione?

1032
01:34:34,408 --> 01:34:37,923
Yeah. I heard about that, all right.

1033
01:34:38,248 --> 01:34:41,763
Look, we have to ask you something.

1034
01:34:43,368 --> 01:34:46,724
Do you know who's opened
the Chamber of Secrets?

1035
01:34:48,968 --> 01:34:51,163
What you had to understand
about that is...

1036
01:34:52,768 --> 01:34:54,281
Quick, under the cloak.

1037
01:34:54,928 --> 01:34:57,886
Don't say a word.
Be quiet, both of you.

1038
01:35:04,048 --> 01:35:07,006
- Professor Dumbledore, sir.
- Good evening, Hagrid.

1039
01:35:07,168 --> 01:35:09,477
I wonder, could we...?

1040
01:35:09,648 --> 01:35:12,037
Of course. Come in. Come in.

1041
01:35:12,208 --> 01:35:13,527
That's Dad's boss.

1042
01:35:13,688 --> 01:35:17,124
Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic.

1043
01:35:17,288 --> 01:35:21,486
Bad business, Hagrid, very bad business.
Had to come.

1044
01:35:21,648 --> 01:35:24,765
Three attacks on Muggle-borns.
Things have gone far enough.

1045
01:35:24,928 --> 01:35:28,000
- The Ministry's got to act.
- But I never...

1046
01:35:28,208 --> 01:35:29,926
You know I never, professor.

1047
01:35:30,088 --> 01:35:33,046
I want it understood, Cornelius...

1048
01:35:33,208 --> 01:35:34,960
...that Hagrid...

1049
01:35:35,128 --> 01:35:37,323
...has my full confidence.

1050
01:35:37,488 --> 01:35:41,117
Albus, look,
Hagrid's record is against him.

1051
01:35:41,288 --> 01:35:43,722
- I've got to take him.
- Take me?

1052
01:35:43,888 --> 01:35:46,083
Take me where?
Not Azkaban prison.

1053
01:35:46,368 --> 01:35:49,963
I'm afraid we have no choice, Hagrid.

1054
01:35:50,568 --> 01:35:52,399
Already here, Fudge?

1055
01:35:52,568 --> 01:35:53,842
Good.

1056
01:35:54,728 --> 01:35:57,367
What are you doing here?
Get out of my house!

1057
01:35:58,008 --> 01:35:59,487
Believe me...

1058
01:35:59,768 --> 01:36:03,807
...I take absolutely no pleasure
being inside your...

1059
01:36:05,608 --> 01:36:07,724
You call this a house?

1060
01:36:08,768 --> 01:36:09,757
No.

1061
01:36:09,928 --> 01:36:13,637
I simply called up the school
and was told the headmaster was here.

1062
01:36:13,808 --> 01:36:17,721
Well, what exactly is it
that you want with me?

1063
01:36:18,248 --> 01:36:22,799
The other governors and I have decided
it's time for you to step aside.

1064
01:36:24,368 --> 01:36:27,166
This is an order of suspension.

1065
01:36:32,488 --> 01:36:35,719
You'll find all 12 signatures on it.

1066
01:36:39,448 --> 01:36:43,487
I'm afraid we feel
you've rather lost your touch.

1067
01:36:44,168 --> 01:36:46,398
Well, what, with all these attacks...

1068
01:36:46,568 --> 01:36:49,241
...there'll be no
Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts.

1069
01:36:49,408 --> 01:36:53,765
I can only imagine what an awful loss
that would be to the school.

1070
01:36:53,928 --> 01:36:56,044
You can't take
Professor Dumbledore away.

1071
01:36:56,328 --> 01:36:58,762
Take him away and the Muggle-borns
won't stand a chance.

1072
01:36:58,928 --> 01:37:01,283
You mark my words,
there'll be killings next!

1073
01:37:01,448 --> 01:37:03,040
You think so?

1074
01:37:03,208 --> 01:37:05,597
Calm yourself, Hagrid.

1075
01:37:06,888 --> 01:37:09,527
If the governors desire my removal...

1076
01:37:09,688 --> 01:37:13,237
...I will, of course, step aside.

1077
01:37:14,768 --> 01:37:16,918
However...

1078
01:37:17,568 --> 01:37:21,925
...you will find that help
will always be given at Hogwarts...

1079
01:37:22,088 --> 01:37:23,885
...to those who...

1080
01:37:24,048 --> 01:37:26,278
...ask for it.

1081
01:37:32,808 --> 01:37:35,038
Admirable sentiments.

1082
01:37:35,208 --> 01:37:36,960
Shall we?

1083
01:37:48,568 --> 01:37:50,047
Fudge.

1084
01:37:51,688 --> 01:37:53,440
Come, Hagrid.

1085
01:37:54,528 --> 01:37:56,007
Well?

1086
01:37:56,648 --> 01:37:57,683
Lf...

1087
01:37:58,088 --> 01:38:00,522
If anybody was looking for some stuff...

1088
01:38:00,688 --> 01:38:05,364
...then all they'd have to do
would be to follow the spiders.

1089
01:38:05,528 --> 01:38:07,996
Yep. That would lead them right.

1090
01:38:08,168 --> 01:38:10,045
That's all I have to say.

1091
01:38:11,688 --> 01:38:15,283
And someone will need
to feed Fang while I'm away.

1092
01:38:18,528 --> 01:38:20,439
Good boy.

1093
01:38:26,328 --> 01:38:28,364
Hagrid's right.

1094
01:38:28,528 --> 01:38:31,361
With Dumbledore gone,
there'll be an attack a day.

1095
01:38:31,528 --> 01:38:33,120
Look.

1096
01:38:38,928 --> 01:38:40,646
Come on.

1097
01:38:44,208 --> 01:38:46,164
Come on, Fang.

1098
01:39:03,688 --> 01:39:05,007
Come on.

1099
01:39:05,168 --> 01:39:06,396
What?

1100
01:39:06,568 --> 01:39:09,685
You heard what Hagrid said.
"Follow the spiders."

1101
01:39:09,888 --> 01:39:12,402
They're heading to the Dark Forest.

1102
01:39:14,368 --> 01:39:18,646
Why spiders? Why couldn't it be
"follow the butterflies"?

1103
01:39:52,928 --> 01:39:55,567
Harry, I don't like this.

1104
01:40:00,488 --> 01:40:03,560
- Harry, I don't like this at all.
- Shush!

1105
01:40:14,608 --> 01:40:17,042
Can we go back now?

1106
01:40:17,208 --> 01:40:18,880
Come on.

1107
01:41:06,568 --> 01:41:09,207
Who is it?

1108
01:41:09,848 --> 01:41:10,917
Don't panic.

1109
01:41:11,248 --> 01:41:12,681
Hagrid?

1110
01:41:13,088 --> 01:41:14,601
Is that you?

1111
01:41:15,168 --> 01:41:16,999
We're friends of Hagrid's.

1112
01:41:34,368 --> 01:41:37,440
And you?
You're Aragog, aren't you?

1113
01:41:38,048 --> 01:41:39,276
Yes.

1114
01:41:39,448 --> 01:41:43,077
Hagrid has never sent
men into our hollow before.

1115
01:41:43,248 --> 01:41:46,240
He's in trouble. Up at the school,
there have been attacks.

1116
01:41:46,848 --> 01:41:48,600
They think it's Hagrid.

1117
01:41:48,768 --> 01:41:52,238
They think he opened
the Chamber of Secrets. Like before.

1118
01:41:52,448 --> 01:41:54,678
That's a lie.

1119
01:41:55,128 --> 01:41:57,926
Hagrid never opened
the Chamber of Secrets.

1120
01:41:58,528 --> 01:42:01,281
- Then you're not the monster?
- No.

1121
01:42:01,448 --> 01:42:04,360
The monster was born in the castle.

1122
01:42:04,568 --> 01:42:09,642
I came to Hagrid from a distant land
in the pocket of a traveler.

1123
01:42:10,248 --> 01:42:11,806
Harry.

1124
01:42:13,648 --> 01:42:18,039
But if you're not the monster, then
what did kill that girl 50 years ago?

1125
01:42:18,208 --> 01:42:21,086
We do not speak of it.

1126
01:42:21,408 --> 01:42:26,721
It is an ancient creature we
spiders fear above all others.

1127
01:42:26,888 --> 01:42:28,606
But have you seen it?

1128
01:42:29,248 --> 01:42:34,845
I never saw any part of the castle
but the box in which Hagrid kept me.

1129
01:42:35,008 --> 01:42:38,045
The girl was discovered
in a bathroom.

1130
01:42:38,208 --> 01:42:42,520
When I was accused,
Hagrid brought me here.

1131
01:42:42,688 --> 01:42:44,599
- Harry!
- What?

1132
01:42:56,928 --> 01:42:59,806
Well, thank you.

1133
01:43:00,728 --> 01:43:02,798
We'll just go.

1134
01:43:03,248 --> 01:43:04,920
Go?

1135
01:43:05,128 --> 01:43:06,846
I think not.

1136
01:43:07,008 --> 01:43:12,241
My sons and daughters
do not harm Hagrid on my command.

1137
01:43:12,408 --> 01:43:14,717
But I cannot deny them
fresh meat...

1138
01:43:14,888 --> 01:43:19,040
...when it wanders
so willingly into our midst.

1139
01:43:19,208 --> 01:43:22,837
Goodbye, friend of Hagrid.

1140
01:43:23,008 --> 01:43:24,760
Can we panic now?

1141
01:43:35,048 --> 01:43:36,879
Know any spells?

1142
01:43:37,048 --> 01:43:40,085
One, but it's not powerful
enough for all of them.

1143
01:43:40,248 --> 01:43:42,887
Where's Hermione when you need her?

1144
01:43:55,848 --> 01:43:57,076
Let's go!

1145
01:44:02,008 --> 01:44:03,999
<i>Arania Exumai!</i>

1146
01:44:09,088 --> 01:44:10,362
Go!

1147
01:44:27,608 --> 01:44:29,599
Glad we're out of there.

1148
01:44:36,288 --> 01:44:38,518
<i>Arania Exumai!</i>

1149
01:44:44,008 --> 01:44:47,603
- Thanks for that.
- Don't mention it.

1150
01:44:58,088 --> 01:45:00,158
Get us out of here.

1151
01:45:00,648 --> 01:45:02,240
Now!

1152
01:45:04,248 --> 01:45:08,321
Come on!
Come on, move faster!

1153
01:45:10,888 --> 01:45:12,162
Come on! Go!

1154
01:45:28,968 --> 01:45:30,924
Get us in the air.

1155
01:45:31,968 --> 01:45:33,367
The flying gear's jammed!

1156
01:45:37,288 --> 01:45:40,917
- Come on! Pull!
- I'm trying!

1157
01:46:09,048 --> 01:46:11,846
Follow the spiders.
Follow the spiders.

1158
01:46:12,008 --> 01:46:16,160
If Hagrid ever gets out of Azkaban,
I'll kill him.

1159
01:46:29,608 --> 01:46:32,680
I mean, what was the point
of sending us in there?

1160
01:46:32,848 --> 01:46:37,285
- What have we found out?
- We know one thing.

1161
01:46:37,448 --> 01:46:40,679
Hagrid never opened
the Chamber of Secrets.

1162
01:46:40,888 --> 01:46:42,799
He was innocent.

1163
01:46:57,648 --> 01:47:00,003
Wish you were here, Hermione.

1164
01:47:00,528 --> 01:47:02,723
We need you.

1165
01:47:03,608 --> 01:47:05,599
Now more than ever.

1166
01:47:21,848 --> 01:47:25,124
- What's that?
- Ron...

1167
01:47:25,928 --> 01:47:30,206
This is why Hermione was in
the library the day she was attacked.

1168
01:47:30,728 --> 01:47:31,922
Come on.

1169
01:47:32,568 --> 01:47:35,401
"Of the many fearsome beasts
that roam our land...

1170
01:47:35,568 --> 01:47:40,005
...none is more deadly than the basilisk.
Capable of living for hundreds of years...

1171
01:47:40,168 --> 01:47:43,797
...instant death awaits any who meet
this giant serpent's eye.

1172
01:47:43,968 --> 01:47:46,846
Spiders flee before it."
Ron, this is it.

1173
01:47:47,008 --> 01:47:49,681
The monster in the Chamber
of Secrets is a basilisk.

1174
01:47:49,848 --> 01:47:53,602
That's why I can hear it speak.
It's a snake.

1175
01:47:53,928 --> 01:47:59,002
But if it kills by looking people
in the eye, why is it no one's dead?

1176
01:48:09,208 --> 01:48:12,006
Because no one did look it
in the eye.

1177
01:48:13,888 --> 01:48:16,356
Not directly, at least.

1178
01:48:17,568 --> 01:48:19,684
Colin saw it through his camera.

1179
01:48:19,848 --> 01:48:23,727
Justin... Justin must have seen the
basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick.

1180
01:48:23,888 --> 01:48:27,722
Nick got the full blast of it.
But he's a ghost, he couldn't die again.

1181
01:48:27,888 --> 01:48:30,880
And Hermione had the mirror.

1182
01:48:31,048 --> 01:48:34,279
I bet you she was using it to look
around corners in case it came along.

1183
01:48:34,448 --> 01:48:35,676
And Mrs. Norris?

1184
01:48:35,848 --> 01:48:39,204
I'm pretty sure she didn't have
a camera or a mirror, Harry.

1185
01:48:40,688 --> 01:48:42,485
The water.

1186
01:48:42,928 --> 01:48:48,286
There was water on the floor that night.
She only saw the basilisk's reflection.

1187
01:48:54,168 --> 01:48:55,999
"Spiders flee before it."

1188
01:48:56,168 --> 01:48:59,763
- It all fits.
- How's a basilisk been getting around?

1189
01:48:59,928 --> 01:49:02,647
A dirty, great snake.
Someone would have seen it.

1190
01:49:02,808 --> 01:49:08,246
- Hermione's answered that too.
- Pipes? It's using the plumbing.

1191
01:49:08,408 --> 01:49:12,481
Remember what Aragog said
about that girl 50 years ago?

1192
01:49:12,648 --> 01:49:16,721
She died in a bathroom?
What if she never left?

1193
01:49:17,368 --> 01:49:18,642
Moaning Myrtle.

1194
01:49:19,568 --> 01:49:23,447
<i>All students are to return</i>
<i>to their house dormitories at once.</i>

1195
01:49:23,608 --> 01:49:26,884
<i>All teachers to the second-floor</i>
<i>corridor immediately.</i>

1196
01:49:31,688 --> 01:49:37,285
As you can see, the Heir of Slytherin
has left another message.

1197
01:49:37,448 --> 01:49:39,564
Our worst fear has been realized.

1198
01:49:39,728 --> 01:49:44,119
A student has been taken by the monster
into the Chamber itself.

1199
01:49:45,128 --> 01:49:50,566
The students must be sent home.
I'm afraid this is the end of Hogwarts.

1200
01:49:52,848 --> 01:49:55,203
So sorry. Dozed off.
What have I missed?

1201
01:49:55,368 --> 01:49:59,520
A girl has been snatched by the monster,
Lockhart. Your moment has come at last.

1202
01:49:59,688 --> 01:50:02,521
- My moment?
- Weren't you saying just last night...

1203
01:50:02,688 --> 01:50:07,045
...that you've known all along where the
entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?

1204
01:50:08,328 --> 01:50:13,607
That's settled. We'll leave you
to deal with the monster, Gilderoy.

1205
01:50:13,768 --> 01:50:18,717
- Your skills, after all, are legend.
- Very well.

1206
01:50:18,888 --> 01:50:21,960
I'll just be in my office getting...

1207
01:50:22,768 --> 01:50:24,645
Getting ready.

1208
01:50:27,448 --> 01:50:30,520
Who is it that the monster's taken,
Minerva?

1209
01:50:30,688 --> 01:50:32,440
Ginny Weasley.

1210
01:50:43,368 --> 01:50:46,326
"Her skeleton will lie
in the Chamber forever."

1211
01:50:50,208 --> 01:50:51,926
Ginny.

1212
01:50:53,928 --> 01:50:57,284
Lockhart may be useless, but he's
going to try and get into the Chamber.

1213
01:50:57,448 --> 01:51:00,042
At least we can tell him
what we know.

1214
01:51:01,328 --> 01:51:03,796
Professor, we have some information
for you.

1215
01:51:05,488 --> 01:51:07,365
Are you going somewhere?

1216
01:51:07,528 --> 01:51:10,520
Well, yes. Urgent call. Unavoidable.
Got to go.

1217
01:51:10,688 --> 01:51:13,760
- What about my sister?
- Well...

1218
01:51:14,088 --> 01:51:17,444
As to that, most unfortunate.
No one regrets more than I.

1219
01:51:17,608 --> 01:51:21,442
You're the Defense Against the Dark
Arts teacher. You can't go now.

1220
01:51:21,608 --> 01:51:24,486
I must say, when I took the job,
there was nothing in the description...

1221
01:51:24,648 --> 01:51:25,763
You're running away?

1222
01:51:25,928 --> 01:51:28,601
- After all you did in your books?
- Books can be misleading.

1223
01:51:28,768 --> 01:51:31,202
- You wrote them.
- My dear boy, use your common sense.

1224
01:51:31,368 --> 01:51:35,600
My books wouldn't have sold as well if
people didn't think I'd done those things.

1225
01:51:36,168 --> 01:51:37,681
You're a fraud.

1226
01:51:37,848 --> 01:51:40,521
You've been taking credit
for what other wizards have done.

1227
01:51:40,688 --> 01:51:42,565
Is there anything you can do?

1228
01:51:42,728 --> 01:51:47,244
Yes, now you mention it.
I'm rather gifted with Memory Charms.

1229
01:51:47,408 --> 01:51:49,797
Otherwise, all those wizards
would have gone blabbing.

1230
01:51:49,968 --> 01:51:52,960
I'd never have sold another book.

1231
01:51:53,128 --> 01:51:58,600
In fact, I'm going to have to do
the same to you.

1232
01:51:59,088 --> 01:52:01,761
Don't even think about it.

1233
01:52:12,168 --> 01:52:13,567
Who's there?

1234
01:52:15,888 --> 01:52:17,844
Hello, Harry.

1235
01:52:18,728 --> 01:52:23,677
- What do you want?
- To ask you how you died.

1236
01:52:25,968 --> 01:52:28,323
It was dreadful.

1237
01:52:28,488 --> 01:52:32,003
It happened right here
in this very cubicle.

1238
01:52:32,168 --> 01:52:36,047
I'd hidden because Olive Hornby
was teasing me about my glasses.

1239
01:52:36,208 --> 01:52:40,918
I was crying, and then
I heard somebody come in.

1240
01:52:41,088 --> 01:52:47,163
- Who was it, Myrtle?
- I don't know. I was distraught!

1241
01:52:48,408 --> 01:52:51,684
But they said something funny,
a kind of made-up language.

1242
01:52:51,848 --> 01:52:57,923
And I realized it was a boy, so I unlocked
the door to tell him to go away and...

1243
01:52:59,048 --> 01:53:03,678
...I died.
- Just like that? How?

1244
01:53:03,848 --> 01:53:08,160
I just remember seeing a pair
of great, big, yellow eyes...

1245
01:53:08,328 --> 01:53:12,003
...over there by that sink.

1246
01:53:36,088 --> 01:53:38,044
This is it.

1247
01:53:38,888 --> 01:53:43,518
This is it, Ron. I think this is
the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets.

1248
01:53:45,448 --> 01:53:50,078
Say something. Harry,
say something in Parseltongue.

1249
01:54:39,528 --> 01:54:43,441
Excellent, Harry. Good work.
Well, then, I'll just be...

1250
01:54:43,608 --> 01:54:45,758
There's no need for me to stay.

1251
01:54:46,368 --> 01:54:48,165
Yes, there is.

1252
01:54:49,928 --> 01:54:52,886
- You first.
- Now, boys, what good will it do?

1253
01:54:53,048 --> 01:54:54,322
Better you than us.

1254
01:54:55,488 --> 01:54:58,286
But... Obviously, yes.

1255
01:55:02,408 --> 01:55:05,002
Sure you don't want to test it first?

1256
01:55:11,528 --> 01:55:14,645
It's really quite filthy down here.

1257
01:55:15,088 --> 01:55:19,445
- All right. Let's go.
- Oh, Harry?

1258
01:55:19,848 --> 01:55:24,558
If you die down there,
you're welcome to share my toilet.

1259
01:55:27,008 --> 01:55:28,885
Thanks, Myrtle.

1260
01:55:56,808 --> 01:56:01,757
Now, remember: Any sign of movement,
close your eyes straightaway.

1261
01:56:02,688 --> 01:56:04,280
Go on.

1262
01:56:07,848 --> 01:56:09,122
This way.

1263
01:56:15,848 --> 01:56:20,876
- What's this?
- It looks like a snake.

1264
01:56:21,048 --> 01:56:24,563
- It's a snakeskin.
- Bloody hell.

1265
01:56:24,728 --> 01:56:30,280
Whatever shed this must be
60 feet long. Or more.

1266
01:56:32,128 --> 01:56:34,961
Heart of a lion, this one.

1267
01:56:38,528 --> 01:56:42,999
The adventure ends here, boys.
But don't fret.

1268
01:56:44,848 --> 01:56:50,081
The world will know our story.
How I was too late to save the girl.

1269
01:56:50,408 --> 01:56:53,764
How you two
tragically lost your minds...

1270
01:56:53,928 --> 01:56:56,806
...at the sight of her mangled body.

1271
01:56:57,608 --> 01:56:59,007
So...

1272
01:57:00,088 --> 01:57:02,318
You first, Mr. Potter.

1273
01:57:02,568 --> 01:57:05,605
Say goodbye to your memories.

1274
01:57:07,568 --> 01:57:09,445
<i>Obliviate!</i>

1275
01:57:41,968 --> 01:57:44,960
- Ron! Ron, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

1276
01:57:48,568 --> 01:57:50,240
Hello.

1277
01:57:50,888 --> 01:57:52,640
Who are you?

1278
01:57:53,968 --> 01:57:56,528
- Ron Weasley.
- Really?

1279
01:57:56,688 --> 01:57:59,441
And who am I?

1280
01:58:01,128 --> 01:58:05,280
Lockhart's Memory Charm backfired.
He hasn't got a clue who he is.

1281
01:58:05,608 --> 01:58:09,920
It's an odd sort of place, isn't it?

1282
01:58:10,088 --> 01:58:12,124
Do you live here?

1283
01:58:12,808 --> 01:58:15,197
- No.
- Really?

1284
01:58:19,608 --> 01:58:21,326
- What do I do now?
- You wait here...

1285
01:58:21,488 --> 01:58:24,321
...and try and shift some of this rock
so we can get back through.

1286
01:58:24,488 --> 01:58:28,003
- I'll go on and find Ginny.
- Okay.

1287
01:59:57,408 --> 02:00:01,117
Ginny! Ginny, please don't be dead.
Wake up, wake up.

1288
02:00:01,608 --> 02:00:03,599
Please wake up.

1289
02:00:03,848 --> 02:00:05,918
She won't wake.

1290
02:00:11,168 --> 02:00:15,320
Tom. Tom Riddle.
What do you mean, she won't wake?

1291
02:00:15,488 --> 02:00:18,719
- She's not...?
- She's still alive, but only just.

1292
02:00:19,688 --> 02:00:21,883
- Are you a ghost?
- A memory...

1293
02:00:22,048 --> 02:00:24,323
...preserved in a diary for 50 years.

1294
02:00:26,888 --> 02:00:31,882
She's cold as ice.
Ginny, please don't be dead. Wake up.

1295
02:00:32,048 --> 02:00:34,357
You've got to help me, Tom.
There's a basilisk.

1296
02:00:34,528 --> 02:00:36,996
It won't come until it's called.

1297
02:00:39,688 --> 02:00:42,407
- Give me my wand, Tom.
- You won't be needing it.

1298
02:00:43,408 --> 02:00:46,684
- We've got to go. We've got to save her.
- I'm afraid I can't do that.

1299
02:00:46,848 --> 02:00:50,727
You see, as poor Ginny grows weaker,
I grow stronger.

1300
02:00:52,008 --> 02:00:56,320
Yes, Harry, it was Ginny Weasley
who opened the Chamber of Secrets.

1301
02:00:56,488 --> 02:00:58,718
No. She couldn't. She wouldn't.

1302
02:00:58,888 --> 02:01:01,960
It was Ginny who set the basilisk
on the Mudbloods and Filch's cat...

1303
02:01:02,128 --> 02:01:04,483
...Ginny who wrote the threatening
messages on the walls.

1304
02:01:04,648 --> 02:01:07,799
- But why?
- Because I told her to.

1305
02:01:07,968 --> 02:01:12,723
You'll find I can be very persuasive.
Not that she knew what she was doing.

1306
02:01:12,888 --> 02:01:16,085
She was, shall we say,
in a kind of trance.

1307
02:01:16,608 --> 02:01:18,997
Still, the power of the diary
began to scare her.

1308
02:01:19,168 --> 02:01:21,443
She tried to dispose of it
in the girls' bathroom.

1309
02:01:21,608 --> 02:01:25,760
And then who should find it but you?

1310
02:01:25,928 --> 02:01:28,920
The very person
I was most anxious to meet.

1311
02:01:29,488 --> 02:01:31,479
And why did you want to meet me?

1312
02:01:31,848 --> 02:01:35,079
I knew I had to talk to you,
meet you if I could.

1313
02:01:35,248 --> 02:01:38,399
So I decided to show you my capture
of that brainless oaf Hagrid...

1314
02:01:38,568 --> 02:01:41,605
...to gain your trust.
- Hagrid's my friend.

1315
02:01:42,488 --> 02:01:46,879
- And you framed him, didn't you?
- It was my word against Hagrid's.

1316
02:01:47,048 --> 02:01:50,199
Only Dumbledore seemed to think
he was innocent.

1317
02:01:50,368 --> 02:01:52,438
I'll bet Dumbledore saw
right through you.

1318
02:01:52,608 --> 02:01:55,918
He certainly kept an annoyingly close
watch on me after that.

1319
02:01:56,088 --> 02:01:59,239
I knew it wouldn't be safe to open the
Chamber again while I was at school...

1320
02:01:59,408 --> 02:02:01,160
...so I decided to leave behind
a diary...

1321
02:02:01,328 --> 02:02:03,364
...preserving my 16-year-old self
in its pages...

1322
02:02:03,528 --> 02:02:06,088
...so that one day
I would be able to lead another...

1323
02:02:06,248 --> 02:02:08,967
...to finish Salazar Slytherin's
noble work.

1324
02:02:09,128 --> 02:02:11,278
Well, you haven't finished it
this time.

1325
02:02:11,448 --> 02:02:14,281
In a few hours, the Mandrake Draught
will be ready.

1326
02:02:14,448 --> 02:02:17,087
And everyone who was Petrified
will be all right again.

1327
02:02:17,448 --> 02:02:22,476
Haven't I told you? Killing Mudbloods
doesn't matter to me anymore.

1328
02:02:22,728 --> 02:02:27,324
For many months now,
my new target has been you.

1329
02:02:28,728 --> 02:02:32,164
How is it that a baby
with no extraordinary magical talent...

1330
02:02:32,328 --> 02:02:34,888
...was able to defeat the greatest wizard
of all time?

1331
02:02:35,208 --> 02:02:38,041
How did you escape with nothing
but a scar...

1332
02:02:38,208 --> 02:02:40,483
...while Lord Voldemort's powers
were destroyed?

1333
02:02:40,648 --> 02:02:44,641
Why do you care how I escaped?
Voldemort was after your time.

1334
02:02:44,808 --> 02:02:51,043
Voldemort is my past,
present and future.

1335
02:03:10,608 --> 02:03:13,918
You. You're the Heir of Slytherin.

1336
02:03:16,968 --> 02:03:20,404
- You're Voldemort.
- Surely you didn't think...

1337
02:03:20,568 --> 02:03:24,880
...I was going to keep
my filthy Muggle father's name?

1338
02:03:25,048 --> 02:03:29,041
No. I fashioned myself a new name,
a name I knew wizards everywhere...

1339
02:03:29,208 --> 02:03:33,247
...would fear to speak when I became
the greatest sorcerer in the world.

1340
02:03:33,408 --> 02:03:36,445
Albus Dumbledore
is the greatest sorcerer in the world.

1341
02:03:36,608 --> 02:03:39,839
Dumbledore's been driven out of
this castle by the mere memory of me.

1342
02:03:40,048 --> 02:03:44,883
He'll never be gone. Not as long as
those who remain are loyal to him.

1343
02:03:51,008 --> 02:03:51,997
Fawkes?

1344
02:04:07,608 --> 02:04:11,044
So this is what Dumbledore
sends his great defender.

1345
02:04:11,208 --> 02:04:14,723
A songbird and an old hat.

1346
02:04:27,488 --> 02:04:31,845
Let's match the power of Lord
Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin...

1347
02:04:32,008 --> 02:04:35,842
...against the famous Harry Potter.

1348
02:04:48,648 --> 02:04:52,800
Parseltongue won't save you now,
Potter. It only obeys me.

1349
02:05:21,768 --> 02:05:23,247
No!

1350
02:05:23,688 --> 02:05:28,000
Your bird may have blinded the basilisk,
but it can still hear you.

1351
02:07:05,808 --> 02:07:08,959
Yes, Potter.
The process is nearly complete.

1352
02:07:09,128 --> 02:07:13,838
In a few minutes, Ginny Weasley will be
dead, and I will cease to be a memory.

1353
02:07:14,008 --> 02:07:16,568
Lord Voldemort will return...

1354
02:07:16,928 --> 02:07:20,967
...very much alive.

1355
02:07:21,648 --> 02:07:23,001
Ginny?

1356
02:09:33,768 --> 02:09:35,281
Remarkable, isn't it...

1357
02:09:35,448 --> 02:09:39,282
...how quickly the venom
of the basilisk penetrates the body?

1358
02:09:39,448 --> 02:09:42,008
I'd guess you have little more
than a minute to live.

1359
02:09:42,328 --> 02:09:46,207
You'll be with your dear
Mudblood mother soon, Harry.

1360
02:09:51,008 --> 02:09:54,523
Funny, the damage a silly
little book can do...

1361
02:09:54,688 --> 02:09:59,523
...especially in the hands
of a silly little girl.

1362
02:10:02,248 --> 02:10:04,000
What are you doing?

1363
02:10:06,728 --> 02:10:08,764
Stop. No!

1364
02:11:04,648 --> 02:11:08,482
It was me.
But I swear, I didn't mean to.

1365
02:11:08,648 --> 02:11:12,004
Riddle made me, and...

1366
02:11:12,488 --> 02:11:15,048
Harry, you're hurt.

1367
02:11:15,368 --> 02:11:16,801
Don't worry.

1368
02:11:16,968 --> 02:11:20,483
Ginny, you need
to get yourself out.

1369
02:11:20,648 --> 02:11:23,765
Follow the Chamber
and you'll find Ron.

1370
02:11:35,408 --> 02:11:37,444
You were brilliant, Fawkes.

1371
02:11:38,528 --> 02:11:40,837
I just wasn't quick enough.

1372
02:12:00,808 --> 02:12:02,446
Of course.

1373
02:12:02,728 --> 02:12:05,447
Phoenix tears have healing powers.

1374
02:12:07,008 --> 02:12:08,726
Thanks.

1375
02:12:10,408 --> 02:12:12,444
It's all right, Ginny.

1376
02:12:13,528 --> 02:12:15,644
It's over.

1377
02:12:16,608 --> 02:12:19,042
It's just a memory.

1378
02:12:21,808 --> 02:12:26,928
Amazing!
This is just like magic!

1379
02:12:37,768 --> 02:12:40,328
You both realize, of course...

1380
02:12:40,488 --> 02:12:45,767
...that in the past few hours, you have
broken perhaps a dozen school rules.

1381
02:12:46,368 --> 02:12:47,357
Yes, sir.

1382
02:12:47,528 --> 02:12:50,600
There is sufficient evidence
to have you both expelled.

1383
02:12:50,768 --> 02:12:51,917
Yes, sir.

1384
02:12:52,088 --> 02:12:54,727
Therefore, it is only fitting...

1385
02:12:56,208 --> 02:12:58,403
...that you both receive...

1386
02:12:58,888 --> 02:13:02,801
...Special Awards for Services
to the School.

1387
02:13:04,808 --> 02:13:06,560
Thanks, sir.

1388
02:13:07,128 --> 02:13:09,323
Now, Mr. Weasley, if you would...

1389
02:13:09,488 --> 02:13:13,481
...have an owl deliver these
release papers to Azkaban.

1390
02:13:14,568 --> 02:13:19,119
I believe we want
our gamekeeper back.

1391
02:13:23,888 --> 02:13:28,040
First, I want to thank you, Harry.

1392
02:13:28,648 --> 02:13:32,004
You must have shown me
real loyalty down in the Chamber.

1393
02:13:32,848 --> 02:13:37,239
Nothing but that
could have called Fawkes to you.

1394
02:13:39,528 --> 02:13:41,007
And...

1395
02:13:41,568 --> 02:13:42,921
...second...

1396
02:13:43,088 --> 02:13:47,684
...I sense that something
is troubling you.

1397
02:13:47,888 --> 02:13:50,277
Am I right, Harry?

1398
02:13:52,048 --> 02:13:53,720
It's just...

1399
02:13:54,848 --> 02:13:59,364
You see, sir, I couldn't help
but notice certain things, certain...

1400
02:13:59,528 --> 02:14:04,966
Certain similarities
between Tom Riddle and me.

1401
02:14:05,488 --> 02:14:06,637
I see.

1402
02:14:06,808 --> 02:14:12,360
Well, you can speak
Parseltongue, Harry. Why?

1403
02:14:12,808 --> 02:14:18,087
Because Lord Voldemort
can speak Parseltongue.

1404
02:14:19,248 --> 02:14:21,887
If I'm not mistaken, Harry...

1405
02:14:22,248 --> 02:14:25,923
...he transferred
some of his powers to you...

1406
02:14:26,088 --> 02:14:28,921
...the night he gave you that scar.

1407
02:14:29,088 --> 02:14:32,797
Voldemort transferred
some of his powers to me?

1408
02:14:34,648 --> 02:14:37,242
Not intentionally...

1409
02:14:38,088 --> 02:14:39,919
...but yes.

1410
02:14:41,768 --> 02:14:44,965
So the Sorting Hat was right.
I should be in Slytherin.

1411
02:14:45,128 --> 02:14:49,758
It's true. You possess many of the
qualities that Voldemort himself prizes.

1412
02:14:49,928 --> 02:14:52,647
Determination, resourcefulness...

1413
02:14:52,808 --> 02:14:56,642
...and if I may say so,
a certain disregard for the rules.

1414
02:14:57,328 --> 02:15:01,162
Why, then, did the Sorting Hat
place you in Gryffindor?

1415
02:15:01,968 --> 02:15:05,483
- Because I asked it to.
- Exactly, Harry. Exactly.

1416
02:15:05,648 --> 02:15:07,639
Which makes you different
from Voldemort.

1417
02:15:07,808 --> 02:15:11,517
It is not our abilities
that show what we truly are.

1418
02:15:11,808 --> 02:15:13,844
It is our choices.

1419
02:15:17,368 --> 02:15:20,644
If you want proof
why you belong in Gryffindor...

1420
02:15:20,808 --> 02:15:25,484
...then I suggest
you look more closely at this.

1421
02:15:26,448 --> 02:15:28,040
Be careful.

1422
02:15:33,488 --> 02:15:36,048
Godric Gryffindor.

1423
02:15:36,208 --> 02:15:40,121
It would take a true Gryffindor
to pull that out of the hat.

1424
02:15:48,648 --> 02:15:49,967
Dobby.

1425
02:15:51,208 --> 02:15:55,406
So this is your master.
The family you serve is the Malfoys.

1426
02:15:57,488 --> 02:16:00,685
I'll deal with you later.

1427
02:16:06,288 --> 02:16:07,846
Out of my way, Potter.

1428
02:16:08,008 --> 02:16:11,444
So it's true. You have returned.

1429
02:16:12,088 --> 02:16:14,761
When the governors learned that
Arthur Weasley's daughter...

1430
02:16:14,928 --> 02:16:18,921
...was taken into the Chamber,
they saw fit to summon me back.

1431
02:16:19,728 --> 02:16:23,641
- Ridiculous.
- Curiously, Lucius, several of them...

1432
02:16:23,808 --> 02:16:27,323
...were under the impression
that you would curse their family...

1433
02:16:27,488 --> 02:16:30,207
...if they did not agree
to suspend me in the first place.

1434
02:16:30,648 --> 02:16:33,958
- How dare you!
- Beg your pardon?

1435
02:16:34,128 --> 02:16:37,757
My sole concern has always been
and will always be...

1436
02:16:37,928 --> 02:16:40,647
...the welfare of this school...

1437
02:16:40,808 --> 02:16:44,926
...and, of course, its students.

1438
02:16:48,808 --> 02:16:52,847
The culprit has been identified,
I presume?

1439
02:16:53,208 --> 02:16:54,687
Yes.

1440
02:16:56,208 --> 02:16:57,960
And?

1441
02:16:59,088 --> 02:17:01,044
Who was it?

1442
02:17:07,208 --> 02:17:09,642
Voldemort.

1443
02:17:10,768 --> 02:17:16,001
Only this time he chose to act
through somebody else...

1444
02:17:16,528 --> 02:17:19,998
...by means of this.

1445
02:17:22,568 --> 02:17:24,047
I see.

1446
02:17:25,448 --> 02:17:29,487
Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter
discovered it.

1447
02:17:29,808 --> 02:17:33,323
One hopes that no more of Lord
Voldemort's old school-things...

1448
02:17:33,488 --> 02:17:36,605
...should find their way
into innocent hands.

1449
02:17:36,928 --> 02:17:40,682
The consequences for the one
responsible would be...

1450
02:17:41,048 --> 02:17:42,845
...severe.

1451
02:17:44,208 --> 02:17:46,881
Well, let us hope...

1452
02:17:47,048 --> 02:17:52,361
...that Mr. Potter will always
be around to save the day.

1453
02:17:53,088 --> 02:17:56,683
Don't worry. I will be.

1454
02:18:05,088 --> 02:18:07,044
Dumbledore.

1455
02:18:08,128 --> 02:18:11,518
Come, Dobby. We're leaving.

1456
02:18:28,088 --> 02:18:32,366
Sir?
I wonder if I could have that?

1457
02:18:38,528 --> 02:18:40,041
Mr. Malfoy.

1458
02:18:40,208 --> 02:18:42,324
Mr. Malfoy!

1459
02:18:42,768 --> 02:18:44,838
I have something of yours.

1460
02:18:46,448 --> 02:18:49,281
Mine? I don't know
what you're talking about.

1461
02:18:49,448 --> 02:18:50,927
I think you do, sir.

1462
02:18:51,088 --> 02:18:54,080
I think you slipped the diary
into Ginny Weasley's cauldron...

1463
02:18:54,248 --> 02:18:55,601
...that day at Diagon Alley.

1464
02:18:56,288 --> 02:18:58,722
You do, do you?

1465
02:19:05,768 --> 02:19:08,726
Why don't you prove it?

1466
02:19:14,728 --> 02:19:16,798
Come, Dobby.

1467
02:19:18,048 --> 02:19:20,004
Open it.

1468
02:19:23,368 --> 02:19:24,847
Dobby.

1469
02:19:25,008 --> 02:19:28,045
Master has given Dobby a sock.

1470
02:19:28,328 --> 02:19:30,319
What? I didn't give...

1471
02:19:30,488 --> 02:19:34,037
Master has presented Dobby
with clothes.

1472
02:19:34,208 --> 02:19:37,120
Dobby is free.

1473
02:19:43,408 --> 02:19:47,003
You lost me my servant!

1474
02:19:53,688 --> 02:19:57,522
You shall not harm Harry Potter.

1475
02:20:09,168 --> 02:20:12,717
Your parents were
meddlesome fools too.

1476
02:20:12,888 --> 02:20:15,925
Mark my words, Potter.
One day soon...

1477
02:20:16,088 --> 02:20:21,082
...you are going to meet
the same sticky end.

1478
02:20:26,568 --> 02:20:32,200
Harry Potter freed Dobby.
How can Dobby ever repay him?

1479
02:20:32,568 --> 02:20:36,641
- Just promise me something.
- Anything, sir.

1480
02:20:38,528 --> 02:20:40,883
Never try to save my life again.

1481
02:20:46,768 --> 02:20:49,646
- Welcome back, Sir Nicholas.
- Thank you.

1482
02:20:49,928 --> 02:20:52,203
- Good evening, Sir Nicholas.
- Good evening.

1483
02:20:52,368 --> 02:20:55,166
- Good to see you, Sir Nicholas.
- Thank you.

1484
02:20:56,488 --> 02:20:58,604
Hello.

1485
02:21:00,248 --> 02:21:04,685
- Hermione! Welcome back.
- Thanks, Sir Nicholas.

1486
02:21:07,808 --> 02:21:11,005
Harry. It's Hermione.

1487
02:21:36,728 --> 02:21:40,277
- Welcome back, Hermione.
- It's good to be back.

1488
02:21:40,448 --> 02:21:42,916
Congratulations.
I can't believe you solved it.

1489
02:21:43,088 --> 02:21:45,238
We had loads of help from you.

1490
02:21:45,408 --> 02:21:48,480
- We couldn't have done it without you.
- Thanks.

1491
02:21:50,248 --> 02:21:53,081
Could I have your attention, please?

1492
02:21:57,088 --> 02:21:59,477
Before we begin the feast...

1493
02:21:59,648 --> 02:22:05,644
...let us have a round of applause
for Professor Sprout, Madam Pomfrey...

1494
02:22:05,808 --> 02:22:09,767
...whose Mandrake juice has been
so successfully administered...

1495
02:22:09,928 --> 02:22:12,488
...to all who had been Petrified.

1496
02:22:22,568 --> 02:22:25,446
Also, in light of the recent events...

1497
02:22:25,608 --> 02:22:27,678
...as a school treat...

1498
02:22:27,848 --> 02:22:31,636
...all exams have been canceled.

1499
02:22:34,208 --> 02:22:35,721
<i>Oh, no.</i>

1500
02:22:51,968 --> 02:22:53,924
Sorry I'm late.

1501
02:22:59,728 --> 02:23:03,960
The owl that delivered my release papers
got all lost and confused.

1502
02:23:04,288 --> 02:23:07,439
Some ruddy bird called Errol.

1503
02:23:22,568 --> 02:23:28,325
And I'd just like to say that if it hadn't
been for you, Harry and Ron...

1504
02:23:28,528 --> 02:23:31,361
...and Hermione, of course...

1505
02:23:32,008 --> 02:23:35,921
...I would still be you-know-where...

1506
02:23:36,088 --> 02:23:39,524
...so I'd just like to say thanks.

1507
02:23:48,528 --> 02:23:51,361
There's no Hogwarts
without you, Hagrid.

- You're a wizard, Harry.
- I'm a what?

1513
02:34:47,640 --> 02:34:50,359
Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.

1514
02:34:51,360 --> 02:34:54,557
"Dear Mr. Potter,
We are pleased to accept you...

1515
02:34:54,760 --> 02:34:57,957
...at Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry."

1516
02:34:58,160 --> 02:35:00,469
- I'm Ron, by the way.
- I'm Hermione Granger.

1517
02:35:00,760 --> 02:35:01,954
I'm Harry. Harry Potter.

- Harry Potter.
- Mr. Potter.

1519
02:35:03,800 --> 02:35:06,155
Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts.

1520
02:35:07,480 --> 02:35:11,189
Shortly, you'll pass through
these doors and join your classmates.

1521
02:35:11,360 --> 02:35:16,639
The first years, please note that the
Dark Forest is strictly forbidden.

1522
02:35:17,760 --> 02:35:22,117
Also, the third-floor corridor
is out of bounds...

1523
02:35:22,280 --> 02:35:25,636
...to everyone who does not wish
to die a most painful death.

1524
02:35:25,800 --> 02:35:28,268
Troll in the dungeon!

1525
02:35:29,760 --> 02:35:31,113
Hermione, move!

1526
02:35:32,760 --> 02:35:34,239
Thought you ought to know.

1527
02:35:34,400 --> 02:35:36,311
Quick, let's hide through that door!

1528
02:35:36,520 --> 02:35:37,509
It's locked!

1529
02:35:37,680 --> 02:35:41,434
- We're done for!
- Move over! <i>Alohomora.</i>

1530
02:35:41,680 --> 02:35:43,989
- It was locked.
- And for good reason.

1531
02:35:50,160 --> 02:35:52,628
Understand this, Harry:
Not all wizards are good.

1532
02:35:53,960 --> 02:35:58,511
Mr. Potter. Our new celebrity.

1533
02:35:58,840 --> 02:36:00,796
But you are a Seeker.

1534
02:36:01,800 --> 02:36:03,358
And the game begins.

1535
02:36:04,800 --> 02:36:08,156
