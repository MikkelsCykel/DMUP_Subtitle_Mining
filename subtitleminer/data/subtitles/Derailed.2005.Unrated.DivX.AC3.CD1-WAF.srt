00:54:42,134 --> 00:54:44,034
Oh, yeah.

794
00:54:44,103 --> 00:54:46,230
Hey! Here's my man.

795
00:54:46,973 --> 00:54:49,032
You OK? You look
like you ran a marathon.

796
00:54:49,108 --> 00:54:50,097
What?

797
00:54:50,910 --> 00:54:52,810
What did you say
to him on the phone?

798
00:54:52,879 --> 00:54:56,644
Well, in our business one has to know
how to light a fire under people.

799
00:54:56,715 --> 00:54:59,912
It's the best way to get things done.
Do you not agree, Charles?

800
00:54:59,985 --> 00:55:02,249
- What's going on here?
- Mr. LaRoche needs you

801
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:04,550
to sign off on that thing
he called about.

802
00:55:05,924 --> 00:55:07,687
Oh, gosh.

803
00:55:07,759 --> 00:55:11,456
- Did you think I would not come?
- No, I thought you got the message.

804
00:55:12,931 --> 00:55:15,024
I'm sorry. I'm confused.

805
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:17,634
But you look so out of shape, Charles.

806
00:55:17,702 --> 00:55:19,727
Sit down and catch
your breath for a second.

807
00:55:19,804 --> 00:55:22,830
- [Deanna] I'll pour coffee.
- You don't know how many times

808
00:55:22,907 --> 00:55:24,807
- I told him to join my tennis club.
- What?

809
00:55:24,876 --> 00:55:28,403
You know Charles. He prefers
to follow sports, not play them.

810
00:55:28,479 --> 00:55:30,640
But one has
to keep fit in today's world

811
00:55:30,715 --> 00:55:33,980
'cause you never know when you'll
need to be at your fighting best.

812
00:55:34,051 --> 00:55:35,984
Please.

813
00:55:36,052 --> 00:55:38,782
He's right. You might have
been able to outrun that mugger.

814
00:55:38,855 --> 00:55:41,688
Oh. Well, from what Charles told me,

815
00:55:41,758 --> 00:55:44,818
that thug had a jump on him
from the very start.

816
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:47,489
This is crazy.
You never had a chance, did you?

817
00:55:47,564 --> 00:55:48,724
I'm gonna get him back.

818
00:55:48,798 --> 00:55:51,858
You're not getting anyone back.
You have a family.

819
00:55:51,935 --> 00:55:53,664
You're so right, Deanna, so right.

820
00:55:53,737 --> 00:55:57,365
You wanna protect your family
'cause at the end of the day,

821
00:55:57,439 --> 00:56:00,033
this is the most important thing
in the whole world.

822
00:56:01,810 --> 00:56:04,506
- Mom, have you seen my sketchbook?
- Get back upstairs.

823
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:06,241
- Go do your homework.
- Charles.

824
00:56:06,315 --> 00:56:09,580
Amy, this is Mr. LaRoche.
He works with your father.

825
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:20,580
