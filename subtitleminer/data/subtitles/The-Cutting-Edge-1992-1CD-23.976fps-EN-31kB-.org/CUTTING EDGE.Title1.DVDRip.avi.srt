1
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,803
It's 1 :00.
It's 1 :00 in the afternoon.

2
00:00:40,007 --> 00:00:41,372
I got a game.

3
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:45,039
The hell happened to the alarm?
I'm supposed to be on the ice.

4
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:46,906
You say, "nein."

5
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:50,706
-Yeah, 9:00. What happened?
-Yeah, "nein."

6
00:00:50,918 --> 00:00:52,408
Badge. Shirt.

7
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:55,247
You say, "nein alarm." Is mistake?

8
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:57,355
No. No mistake.

9
00:00:57,558 --> 00:01:02,257
This is great. Late for the Olympics.
I'm just about four hours late, Rita.

10
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:05,057
-"Rita"?
-I don't believe this.

11
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:07,691
"Rita"?

12
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:11,501
-Leta?
-"Leta"?

13
00:01:19,947 --> 00:01:21,039
Anita.

14
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:23,140
Namen, Gita.

15
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:24,874
Gita.

16
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:59,548
This is the Olympics, Kate.
Thirty million people...

17
00:01:59,753 --> 00:02:02,847
...just called their families in
from the kitchen to watch the replay.

18
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:06,219
What do you think this is, Kate?
Junior Pairs '82?

19
00:02:07,361 --> 00:02:11,058
No. As I recall, in '82 you were
still humiliating me in private.

20
00:02:11,265 --> 00:02:13,028
Maybe because
you were still listening.

21
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:15,463
If I'm going deaf, it's because
I've had you...

22
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:18,229
...screaming in my ear
for the last nine years.

23
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,872
He's not giving me
anything to work with.

24
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:23,301
Rick, this is impossible.

25
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:27,737
I wanna see your ass in the air.

26
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:39,423
Until Hercules here
learns how to lock his grip...

27
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:41,560
...this will have to do.

28
00:02:55,242 --> 00:02:57,073
-Name, son?
-Dorsey, U.S. hockey.

29
00:02:57,277 --> 00:02:59,837
Hell, son, they're just about to start.

30
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:07,478
Kate, this has to stop right now.

31
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:10,279
Rick knows what's best, honey.
He got us here.

32
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,685
How sweet. He lets us tag along.

33
00:03:12,893 --> 00:03:16,488
You're gonna go back out there,
apologize, and get to work.

34
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:20,027
I wouldn't bet the ranch, Dad.

35
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:23,293
-Where do you think you're going?
-I'll be in my cell.

36
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:51,428
What--? What are you--?

37
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:53,189
Does this go up to the ice?

38
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,697
Does this go up to the ice?

39
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,664
-What?
-Does this go up to the ice?

40
00:03:57,204 --> 00:03:59,638
Is that all you have to say?
Were you raised in a barn?

41
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:03,006
Honey, where I'm from,
we stand for the national anthem.

42
00:04:11,151 --> 00:04:13,449
If you're just joining us
from the men's downhill...

43
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:16,713
-...you're in for a big surprise.
-West Germany was supposed...

44
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:20,290
...to be easy for the United States,
but here in the third period...

45
00:04:20,494 --> 00:04:24,260
... West Germany is up by a goal.
Doug Dorsey, down to the last dime...

46
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:26,694
...of a two-minute penalty
for high-sticking.

47
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,767
-He can't wait. Neither can the fans.
-Come on.

48
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:33,770
Four, three, two, one.

49
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:35,936
Dorsey running out.

50
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:38,737
They'll hit him with the breakaway.
It's offside.

51
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,514
Doug Dorsey, the phenom
from Mayhorn, Minnesota.

52
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:45,116
What a super story, Bud.
A junior from Minnesota State.

53
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:47,149
Talk about being on the fast track.

54
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:51,017
There are at least 1 2 NHL clubs
that'd love to have him on their roster.

55
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:52,953
Just an incredible young athlete.

56
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,993
If you haven't seen him before,
you're in for a real treat.

57
00:04:56,196 --> 00:04:59,825
We're talking about one of the finest
skaters in amateur hockey today.

58
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:02,263
There was a piece this week.
A writer called him:

59
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:04,562
"The Minnesota Machine. "

60
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:07,171
U.S.A., U.S.A., U.S.A.

61
00:07:18,205 --> 00:07:19,900
For the record...

62
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:24,173
...you've lost 1 8 degrees
of peripheral vision in your right eye.

63
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:28,338
Now, in most cases, this would be
considered an inconvenience.

64
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:31,808
-But for a hockey player--
-So how long before it comes back?

65
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:37,088
You've had extreme trauma
to your occipital lobe.

66
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,087
Doc, how long?

67
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,395
You got a blind side, Doug.

68
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:49,566
It's a permanent condition.

69
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:52,296
-So there's an operation, right?
-I'm afraid not.

70
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:55,406
Some micro-laser thing....
You open me up and--

71
00:07:55,609 --> 00:07:58,578
Doug, I've specialized in ophthalmic
surgery for over 1 5 years.

72
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:02,145
Okay, you don't do it, but somebody,
somewhere.... Down in Mexico City...

73
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:05,682
...they shoot shark piss up your nose,
you sit in traction for eight months.

74
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:07,113
Doug...

75
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:09,321
...I'm sorry.

76
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,852
I don't see professional hockey
in your future.

77
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:47,519
-See you at the game tonight, Doug.
-Not if I see you first.

78
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:49,490
-See you, Mike.
-Mike.

79
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,755
Anybody seen my wife?

80
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:57,402
Ice-time meltdown.

81
00:08:57,604 --> 00:09:00,402
You're listening to WICV,
Duluth, Minnesota.

82
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:03,007
We're gonna warm you up.

83
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,643
-Hi, Doug.
-ln a hurry. Any mail?

84
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:15,116
-No.
-I got a game. Make me a sandwich.

85
00:09:15,322 --> 00:09:17,882
Little brother, Snyder can't make it.
I need a hand.

86
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:19,718
-I got a game.
-Hi, Dougie.

87
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:22,360
-It's Friday night.
-Make me a sandwich.

88
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,427
-I need a hand.
-I need a sandwich.

89
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:28,500
Dougie, wait a minute.

90
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:32,368
Doug, I got no place else to go.

91
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,802
You're my brother,
not my boss, okay?

92
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:37,977
Douglas, I'm not asking you,
I'm telling you.

93
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:42,137
Will you get off my back?
I'm no bartender. Get used to it.

94
00:09:42,349 --> 00:09:45,876
What the hell's that mean?
What makes you so special?

95
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:48,144
You're playing
in a goddamn bar league.

96
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:50,084
Hey, Walt, at least I'm playing.

97
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:54,351
Hey. Your 23rd letter arrived today.

98
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,957
Detroit Red Wings.

99
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:03,496
It's over, little brother.
Everybody knows it but you.

100
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:06,237
-Give me that.
-"Doug, sorry about the eye.

101
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,669
-Next time you're in town...
-Give me that letter.

102
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:11,502
-...we'll buy you a ticket."
-Give me that goddamn letter!.

103
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,201
What are you gonna do?

104
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:14,710
You gonna fight me?

105
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:16,882
Are you gonna fight the world?
Everybody?

106
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,483
Well, put me on the list, pal.
Come on, let's go.

107
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:27,151
You want something to eat,
make it yourself.

108
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,485
All right, Kate. Enough.

109
00:10:57,424 --> 00:10:59,654
Lovely. Let's do it again.

110
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:08,963
Do we or do we not
have eight minutes left?

111
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,262
Enough for today.

112
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:15,600
Perhaps you are wanting
to take shower, da?

113
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:17,037
All right.

114
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:20,980
What he needs
is a ride to the airport.

115
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:24,412
I've got laundry that
can skate better than that.

116
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,349
He lasted a month.

117
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,461
You should've been making
her singles skater.

118
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:40,725
So where do we go from here?

119
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:43,966
Two years, eight partners.

120
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,570
This one too small.
That one too big. Too loud.

121
00:11:46,773 --> 00:11:50,300
Too much sweat. Not enough sweat.

122
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,944
Jack, she is tremendous skater.

123
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:54,807
Everyone is saying this.

124
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:58,074
Petite. Powerful. Intelligent.

125
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:01,720
But always is coming the big B.

126
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:03,513
What a bitch.

127
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:07,350
-What about Spindler?
-Spindler?

128
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:11,727
Spindler say
before he skate with her...

129
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:14,559
...he wear garlic from neck
and sleep with cross.

130
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,664
Who is left?

131
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:19,936
I am....

132
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:23,138
I am at bottom of barrel.

133
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:26,040
Then you find another barrel.

134
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:53,797
You are bigger than I think.

135
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:59,302
-What?
-You are much bigger than I think.

136
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:02,072
I'm spending much time
watching video of you...

137
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:05,115
...Mr. Douglas Dorsey.

138
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:07,081
You are very exciting skater.

139
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:10,347
If you're a reporter, you're a little late.
The story's been done.

140
00:13:10,557 --> 00:13:12,081
No. I am coach.

141
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,783
What, you goof on me,
my brother buys you a beer?

142
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:17,559
What means "goof"?

143
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,968
-Are you the Swede?
-No, I'm Russian.

144
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:24,864
My name is Anton Pamchenko.

145
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:27,767
From the Leafs. I can't believe it.
You got my letter.

146
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:30,875
I'm in the best shape of my life.
I'm like a rock.

147
00:13:31,077 --> 00:13:34,274
I skate five, six hours a night,
speed drills, stick drills, roadwork.

148
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,710
I am not hockey coach.

149
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:41,945
-What is this?
-Maybe nothing.

150
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:43,945
Here.

151
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:47,025
You try.

152
00:13:52,732 --> 00:13:55,064
Those are figure skates, pal.

153
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:32,466
I should've held out for more.

154
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,230
This way.

155
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:12,767
-You got your own rink.
-We have ice every day.

156
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,217
That's not Spindler.

157
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:29,623
Where the hell is Spindler?
I thought you said he'd be here.

158
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:32,229
No. You said Spindler.
This is Dorsey.

159
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,366
Mr. Douglas Dorsey.

160
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:37,426
Dorsey? Never heard of him.

161
00:15:37,637 --> 00:15:40,538
Douglas is beautiful skater.

162
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:45,041
You're that hockey player.

163
00:15:46,913 --> 00:15:48,744
How you doing?

164
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:52,945
-Nice to meet you.
-ls tryout.

165
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:54,642
Is tryout.

166
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:07,156
Oh, my God.

167
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:09,334
-What, my hand?
-What do you do?

168
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:10,934
Soak them in battery acid?

169
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:14,334
I know they're rough, but I've never
had any complaints before.

170
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,269
Oh, I'm terribly impressed.

171
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:20,105
What is this, final stages
of Ukrainian alcohol psychosis?

172
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:21,871
Who's checking out who here?

173
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:24,549
I don't know how many shots
you've taken to the brain...

174
00:16:24,751 --> 00:16:27,549
...but this was your audition.
And let me assure you, it's over.

175
00:16:27,754 --> 00:16:30,314
Snow White, I'm no figure skater.
I'm a hockey player.

176
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:31,990
Then what are you doing here?

177
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,458
Get him out of my building.

178
00:16:39,632 --> 00:16:42,567
-What?
-Get him out of my building.

179
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:45,600
Temperamental?
I can think of another word for it.

180
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:48,266
-ls that what you told him?
-It's a big secret?

181
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:50,874
-Who do you think you are?
-I know exactly who I am.

182
00:16:51,077 --> 00:16:52,704
A guy who came
a long way for lunch.

183
00:16:52,912 --> 00:16:55,642
Please don't let me keep you
from the trough.

184
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:59,543
I'm sorry, buddy. I wouldn't wish this
on a snake. I'm out of here.

185
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:04,052
Enough.

186
00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:06,589
Introduction is over.
Conversation finished.

187
00:17:06,793 --> 00:17:08,761
Mouths closed.
Ears to be opened.

188
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:12,294
Pairs means two.
You have no partner.

189
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:14,693
You're skating nowhere.

190
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:17,927
And where are you going?
Oh, back to Siberia?

191
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:22,402
Skating on small pond
is big excitement.

192
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:25,270
Believe me, Gretzky...

193
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,570
...I am last person
who's coming to look for you.

194
00:17:32,952 --> 00:17:34,385
Good.

195
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:37,386
We skate.

196
00:17:38,024 --> 00:17:43,052
You are taking her left hand,
and your right hand is at her waist.

197
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,662
Good. The line is beautiful.

198
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:49,266
Now I am counting a beat.

199
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:52,437
You push off on four.
Katya will lead.

200
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:54,572
Hey, hold on.
What's the deal with these...

201
00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:56,366
...claws up front here?

202
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:59,474
-ls toe pick.
-Toe pick?

203
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,341
Let me guess. It has something
to do with personal hygiene.

204
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:07,281
-I wouldn't let that get in your way.
-I don't let anything get in my way.

205
00:18:09,222 --> 00:18:10,621
Count it off.

206
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:16,759
And one and four.

207
00:18:17,697 --> 00:18:20,427
Good. Good. Head up. Yes.

208
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:25,036
Arms up. Katya, keep in line with him.
Is not race, Katya.

209
00:18:25,705 --> 00:18:27,195
Together. Together.

210
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:30,375
-What, you shower once a week?
-ls that an invitation?

211
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:32,544
Douglas, bend knees more.

212
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:34,144
Good.

213
00:18:34,347 --> 00:18:35,905
Hey. Hey.

214
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,946
Oh, shit.

215
00:18:39,385 --> 00:18:41,114
Toe pick.

216
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:48,390
Katya, lift arms, please.

217
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:50,619
Go on. Lift arms.

218
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:55,531
Douglas, please to pick her up.

219
00:18:56,903 --> 00:18:59,201
-Yeah?
-Yes.

220
00:18:59,405 --> 00:19:00,599
Pick up.

221
00:19:07,947 --> 00:19:09,574
Okay. Enough.

222
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,975
-We are finish.
-I told you this was ridiculous.

223
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,186
Would you please put me down?

224
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,851
You-- You cretin.

225
00:19:23,062 --> 00:19:24,529
Guess that move needs some work.

226
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,101
What a waste of good ice.

227
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:37,871
Ridiculous.

228
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:45,706
Stare at it long enough, you'll start
to see an Olympic gold medal in there.

229
00:19:46,953 --> 00:19:49,581
Jack Moseley. Sit down.
Sit down, please.

230
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:52,690
Look, I've spoken with Anton.

231
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:55,588
First of all, the simple fact
that he brought you out--

232
00:19:55,795 --> 00:19:57,922
You should feel proud.
I mean, we're talking...

233
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:01,224
...about probably the greatest
judge of skating talent in the world.

234
00:20:01,434 --> 00:20:04,665
Central Soviet Army Sports Club,
Moscow lce Ballet, the works.

235
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,730
I saw you skate in Calgary.

236
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,465
You were a great,
great hockey player.

237
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:13,167
Don't feel as though this were
a complete waste of time.

238
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:15,711
I mean, it was worth a shot.

239
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:19,583
-What, the eye?
-No, the eye's not a problem.

240
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:21,514
Is it your daughter?

241
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:25,218
Kate is Kate.

242
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:27,415
She's an only child,
raised without a mother.

243
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:28,957
The strain of competition....

244
00:20:29,996 --> 00:20:32,863
Sudden changes tend
to bring out...

245
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,123
...her color.

246
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:35,664
Is that what that was?

247
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:41,762
Frankly, the idea's just
a little too bizarre for me.

248
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:44,739
I believe you're on a 1 0:30 flight,
first class.

249
00:20:44,944 --> 00:20:48,937
-There's a check for your trouble.
-This is called giving me a shot?

250
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:52,946
I don't have time to screw around.
I can't afford to be wrong about you.

251
00:20:53,152 --> 00:20:55,211
We were 45 seconds away
from the gold medal.

252
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:56,945
And our boy dropped the ball.

253
00:20:57,156 --> 00:20:59,488
That goddamn glass box
is empty for one reason:

254
00:20:59,692 --> 00:21:01,387
We can't find a go-to guy.

255
00:21:02,061 --> 00:21:04,529
Thirty-five male skaters.

256
00:21:05,064 --> 00:21:07,794
These boys have been doing this
for years and couldn't cut it.

257
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,467
Wagner...

258
00:21:09,902 --> 00:21:11,233
...no stamina.

259
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:14,234
Myersohn, no rhythm.

260
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,499
Leone, Parnes, Hudler.

261
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,774
Not one single pressure-player
in the bunch.

262
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:44,967
Lucky shot.

263
00:22:00,219 --> 00:22:01,743
Double or nothing.

264
00:22:03,756 --> 00:22:05,587
You're on.

265
00:22:13,466 --> 00:22:15,263
Katie, there you are.

266
00:22:15,468 --> 00:22:17,595
Hi. I was just coming
to say goodbye.

267
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:20,533
Hold that thought.
Doug's staying with us for a while.

268
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:22,434
-Good talking to you, Jack.
-Doug.

269
00:22:23,642 --> 00:22:25,837
Catch your act tomorrow.

270
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:33,517
It's the end of the line, honey.

271
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:38,822
If we're working together,
try being polite.

272
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,356
You won't be here long enough
to make it worth the effort.

273
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,757
-Think I can't put up with your shit?
-I don't think you can skate.

274
00:22:44,964 --> 00:22:47,159
There's two things I do
really well, sweetheart.

275
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:48,993
And skating's the other one.

276
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,601
God. You really are a Neanderthal.

277
00:22:51,804 --> 00:22:53,931
I hate to tell you,
but I'm from Minnesota.

278
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,074
That's south of Neanderthal.

279
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:59,601
What do you do for fun,
polish your knife collection?

280
00:22:59,812 --> 00:23:02,212
I'm sure there's nothing I do
that you'd find exciting.

281
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:04,245
I don't open beer bottles
with my toes.

282
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:06,748
I don't sit around and count
what's left of my teeth.

283
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:10,415
Hey, I don't even enjoy
a good tractor-pull.

284
00:23:10,623 --> 00:23:12,750
Limited existence,
but I've gotten used to it.

285
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:15,426
Life of the party.
Place must be crawling with guys.

286
00:23:15,628 --> 00:23:17,596
As a matter of fact,
I do have a boyfriend.

287
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:20,264
A rough gig. You keep him
chained up in the basement?

288
00:23:21,467 --> 00:23:24,231
Hale, at the moment, is working
in my father's London office.

289
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:25,869
He's an M.B.A.

290
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:29,973
Harvard. You might've heard of it.
They do have a hockey team.

291
00:23:30,176 --> 00:23:31,666
Must be a very smart guy.

292
00:23:32,378 --> 00:23:33,936
First position.

293
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:36,376
Bet you look good
from a few thousand miles away.

294
00:23:37,383 --> 00:23:39,146
Okay, Douglas.

295
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:41,809
Come. Shoulders back.

296
00:23:42,021 --> 00:23:43,784
Good, good. Now, chest out.

297
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:46,321
Yes. Shoulders back. Head higher.

298
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:51,692
When we're through, can we teach it
how to breathe with its mouth closed?

299
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:57,428
Don't quit your day job.

300
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:01,703
Man and woman
together make flower.

301
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:03,841
Douglas, you are stem.

302
00:24:04,043 --> 00:24:05,635
Katya, you are petal.

303
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:08,472
Together, we make flower.

304
00:24:11,317 --> 00:24:12,511
Toe pick.

305
00:24:22,828 --> 00:24:24,125
Toe pick.

306
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:30,491
Toe pick.

307
00:24:42,348 --> 00:24:44,407
Toe pick.

308
00:25:08,941 --> 00:25:11,307
Whoa. Dorsey back to Gretzky,
over to Esposito.

309
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,205
LaFontaine to Dorsey.
Dorsey to Gretzky.

310
00:25:13,412 --> 00:25:15,846
Gretzky to Dorsey.
Dorsey shoots. He scores.

311
00:25:16,048 --> 00:25:17,572
Yes.

312
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:28,992
If you're bored, why not read?

313
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:33,096
-What, you mean a book?
-That's a traditionally accepted format.

314
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:35,724
Is this the beginning
of a conversation here?

315
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:38,661
I was just simply asking
if you knew how to read.

316
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:41,431
Yes. Doug can read.

317
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,733
What was the last book you read?

318
00:25:45,511 --> 00:25:46,808
You were in college.

319
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:49,537
Last thing I read was a letter
canceling my scholarship...

320
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:51,147
...when I couldn't play anymore.

321
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:53,181
-Okay. High school.
-I was a hockey player.

322
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:55,353
The only thing I had to read
was a scoreboard.

323
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:58,784
-And they graduated you?
-They revered me. I was a god.

324
00:25:58,991 --> 00:26:01,084
What a tragic commentary
on our times.

325
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:03,693
State championships,
my last game...

326
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:06,922
...three hundred people carried me
around their shoulders on the ice.

327
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:09,498
It took the state police
two hours to break it up.

328
00:26:09,702 --> 00:26:13,138
What were you planning on doing
when your gladiating days were over?

329
00:26:13,339 --> 00:26:17,105
You can bet your tights I never thought
I'd work in a freak show like this.

330
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:20,767
I'm surprised you don't chuck it all
and start your own think tank.

331
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:24,939
So where'd you matriculate from?

332
00:26:30,122 --> 00:26:32,147
You were in college?

333
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:35,259
I had tutors.

334
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,454
Excellent tutors.

335
00:26:43,235 --> 00:26:46,830
Would you please find someplace
else to put your clubs?

336
00:26:48,374 --> 00:26:50,365
Man, would I love
to see you play hockey.

337
00:26:52,411 --> 00:26:53,969
Any day.

338
00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:03,344
You can do better than that.
Come on.

339
00:27:05,524 --> 00:27:06,889
Hey.

340
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:10,386
Come on.

341
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:31,411
That's one.

342
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:36,849
Come on, take it.

343
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:41,219
Cut it out.

344
00:27:52,604 --> 00:27:54,128
That's two.

345
00:27:57,943 --> 00:27:58,910
Stop it, you--

346
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:03,847
Three.

347
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:06,581
Four.

348
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:14,788
You make me ill.

349
00:28:43,522 --> 00:28:45,956
It's not like his nose was perfect.

350
00:28:46,525 --> 00:28:49,016
He's the one who wanted to play.

351
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:52,022
He's like those morons
who insist you hit them...

352
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:54,324
...in the stomach
as hard as you can.

353
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:57,758
I don't know why
I'm explaining this to you.

354
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:00,404
All I did was play his stupid game.

355
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:03,032
Next you'll be telling me
how guilty I sound.

356
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:04,470
Is not guilt.

357
00:29:05,511 --> 00:29:06,978
Well, at least we agree on that.

358
00:29:07,613 --> 00:29:09,171
Is fear.

359
00:29:09,381 --> 00:29:12,817
You've gotta be kidding me.
What do I have to be afraid of?

360
00:29:13,018 --> 00:29:15,748
Because finally you have
found yourself a partner.

361
00:29:19,658 --> 00:29:23,219
Oh, my God. I thought you said
it was just his nose.

362
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:30,097
-What? What's wrong?
-He's all yours.

363
00:29:40,012 --> 00:29:41,502
Toe pick.

364
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,148
What's her problem?

365
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,752
I think she is nervous
about rematch.

366
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:57,151
Kate.

367
00:31:26,785 --> 00:31:28,912
You want my hands where?

368
00:31:32,591 --> 00:31:34,821
You gotta be kidding.

369
00:31:36,795 --> 00:31:38,763
-How am I doing?
-Maybe in about five years...

370
00:31:38,964 --> 00:31:41,364
...you'll get it up to half-speed.

371
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:43,659
Hey.

372
00:31:43,935 --> 00:31:45,562
Hey, come on.

373
00:31:45,771 --> 00:31:47,568
Douglas? Douglas, come back.

374
00:31:47,773 --> 00:31:49,934
You have the mentality
of a rock, you know that?

375
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,508
Yes.

376
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:19,428
Yes. Yes. Yes.

377
00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:27,862
She's got everything.

378
00:33:28,073 --> 00:33:29,802
A house, the rink.

379
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,805
I don't get it.

380
00:33:33,945 --> 00:33:36,573
You know something,
I don't even think she likes to skate.

381
00:33:36,782 --> 00:33:38,579
You worked in factory.

382
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:40,584
You were happy there?

383
00:33:40,786 --> 00:33:43,220
Hey, I worked there
because I had to.

384
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,754
Just a moment, please.

385
00:34:16,955 --> 00:34:19,355
-Kate. Oh, you're--
-What the hell are you doing?

386
00:34:19,591 --> 00:34:20,785
-Did I say come in?
-No.

387
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:23,222
Get out. Get out.

388
00:34:23,528 --> 00:34:24,756
Get out this second.

389
00:34:24,963 --> 00:34:27,397
I handle this stuff all the time.
It's no big mystery.

390
00:34:33,872 --> 00:34:36,136
-What's that?
-Open it up.

391
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:38,941
Go on.
I wrapped it myself.

392
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:43,307
What do you get for the girl
who has everything?

393
00:34:46,852 --> 00:34:48,319
An old shirt.

394
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:53,285
An old shirt?
Bobby Hull wore that sweater.

395
00:34:53,792 --> 00:34:56,283
That's Bobby Hull's game sweater.
That--

396
00:34:56,862 --> 00:34:58,625
I've had that 1 5 years.

397
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:00,559
Bobby Hull.

398
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:03,291
-Forget it. I'll take it--
-No, no. I like it.

399
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:05,435
I'll get something else.
You'll tear it.

400
00:35:05,637 --> 00:35:07,332
Then let go.

401
00:35:11,343 --> 00:35:12,935
Thank you.

402
00:35:14,246 --> 00:35:16,146
So anyway, merry Christmas.

403
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:18,549
Well, wait a minute.

404
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,650
Merry Christmas.

405
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,646
"Great Expectations."

406
00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:54,250
Well, it was either that or
Curious George Plays Hockey.

407
00:35:56,388 --> 00:35:58,618
I took a chance.

408
00:36:00,292 --> 00:36:01,520
Thanks.

409
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,459
You're welcome.

410
00:36:52,911 --> 00:36:54,674
Hale. Hale?

411
00:36:55,947 --> 00:37:00,316
Kate. I was looking at your stuff.
Great pictures in here.

412
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:03,453
That's your mom, right?
Boy, she was a knockout.

413
00:37:03,655 --> 00:37:05,623
Yes, she was very pretty.

414
00:37:05,824 --> 00:37:07,314
She was a show skater.

415
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:10,153
There's one over here.
You look too young to walk yet.

416
00:37:10,362 --> 00:37:11,727
You got skates on.

417
00:37:12,297 --> 00:37:15,061
What is this expression on your face?
Is that a smile?

418
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:17,359
I never knew you had
so many teeth.

419
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:20,202
We usually keep this door
closed during a party.

420
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:21,997
Am I some guy off the street?

421
00:37:22,207 --> 00:37:25,699
You probably didn't recognize me
in my rig here. It's pretty sharp, huh?

422
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,172
Sixty-nine ninety-five.

423
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,881
Turn around.

424
00:37:35,053 --> 00:37:37,544
-What are you doing?
-Turn around.

425
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:43,283
Thank you.

426
00:37:46,398 --> 00:37:48,298
-Done?
-Yes.

427
00:37:50,402 --> 00:37:52,302
That book you gave me,
it's pretty good.

428
00:37:52,504 --> 00:37:54,995
Really? Using it as a doorstop
or a coaster?

429
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:56,969
Very funny. Here.

430
00:37:57,175 --> 00:37:59,700
-No, I don't drink.
-It's only champagne.

431
00:37:59,911 --> 00:38:01,538
I've never had a drink in my life.

432
00:38:01,746 --> 00:38:03,907
You're kidding.
You afraid you're gonna get fat?

433
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:06,481
-I hardly expect you to understand.
-Kate.

434
00:38:06,684 --> 00:38:08,879
-Hale.
-There you are.

435
00:38:09,087 --> 00:38:13,387
-Doug Dorsey, Hale Forrest.
-Well. Finally.

436
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:14,853
The secret weapon.

437
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,389
In the flesh.

438
00:38:20,365 --> 00:38:21,855
I guess this calls for a toast.

439
00:38:22,067 --> 00:38:24,331
Let's drink to the little people.

440
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:28,100
I understand you were
at Minnesota State.

441
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:29,603
For a while.

442
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:31,969
I used to play
a little hockey myself. For fun.

443
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,244
Let me know.
We'll slap it around sometime.

444
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:37,581
Sure. And maybe you
can stop by the office.

445
00:38:37,782 --> 00:38:40,478
-Help me with currency arbitrage.
-lf you two will excuse me.

446
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:43,711
Naked male-insecurity
really leaves me cold.

447
00:38:47,192 --> 00:38:48,420
Must be tough to stay away.

448
00:38:49,194 --> 00:38:51,162
I understand you're giving Kate
a rough time.

449
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:52,954
You know Kate.

450
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:58,258
Yes, I do. And I don't like
to see her upset.

451
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:02,433
If I was you,
I'd invest in blindfolds.

452
00:39:28,433 --> 00:39:31,231
Seven, six, five...

453
00:39:31,436 --> 00:39:34,928
...four, three, two, one.

454
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,334
Happy New Year.

455
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:38,566
Happy New Year.

456
00:39:39,644 --> 00:39:41,077
Happy New Year.

457
00:39:46,284 --> 00:39:48,115
Happy New Year.

458
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:56,384
Happy New Year, sweetheart.

459
00:39:56,594 --> 00:39:58,323
Happy New Year!.

460
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:41,434
-Who is it?
-It's me, Kate.

461
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:54,475
-Hi.
-Hi.

462
00:40:56,354 --> 00:40:59,255
I spoke to Anton. He said you were
leaving for the weekend.

463
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,254
-What, that's a problem?
-No, it's great.

464
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,450
You haven't been home
since you got here.

465
00:41:03,661 --> 00:41:06,755
They probably think we've got you
under lock and key.

466
00:41:07,865 --> 00:41:09,890
-Come on in.
-I haven't been here in a while.

467
00:41:10,101 --> 00:41:12,262
Not since Brian.
Brian had mirrors up all over.

468
00:41:12,503 --> 00:41:13,765
Oh, yeah, I took them down.

469
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:17,874
It's kind of a mess.
I wasn't expecting any company.

470
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:20,307
What's this?

471
00:41:21,346 --> 00:41:22,608
That's me smelling the ice.

472
00:41:22,947 --> 00:41:24,915
I told this guy once
I loved how ice smelled.

473
00:41:25,116 --> 00:41:27,380
It became this thing.
Somebody got a camera.

474
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:29,978
-I never thought about it.
-I'm not surprised.

475
00:41:30,188 --> 00:41:31,587
What's that supposed to mean?

476
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:33,450
-Kate.
-I'll be right there.

477
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:35,853
What did you mean by that?

478
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:39,993
I think you'd skate even better
if you'd let yourself enjoy it a little.

479
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:43,763
Wait. What's this? I come up to say,
"Have a nice weekend"...

480
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:45,595
...and you're
gonna give me pointers?

481
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:47,236
-You brought it up.
-No, I didn't.

482
00:41:47,438 --> 00:41:48,632
-Yes, you did.
-No, I didn't.

483
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,808
-Yes, you did.
-No--

484
00:41:55,446 --> 00:41:57,380
I came to give you this.

485
00:41:57,682 --> 00:42:00,412
-What's that?
-It's our greatest hits.

486
00:42:01,386 --> 00:42:02,978
It's a video for your family...

487
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:04,814
...of us skating.

488
00:42:05,423 --> 00:42:07,653
-Thanks.
-My dad booked some extra rooms...

489
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:10,487
...in Chicago, and we'd love them
to stay with us.

490
00:42:10,962 --> 00:42:13,760
-My family?
-Yes. To the nationals.

491
00:42:13,965 --> 00:42:15,728
They're coming, aren't they?

492
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:17,264
I don't know.

493
00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:19,698
Look at all you've done.
They must be excited.

494
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:21,701
Honey, it's a 7::30 show.

495
00:42:21,906 --> 00:42:23,703
-You better go.
-Why wouldn't they come?

496
00:42:23,908 --> 00:42:25,569
They're coming. Hale's waiting.

497
00:42:25,777 --> 00:42:27,677
How do you know
if you haven't told them?

498
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:29,369
-I'm gonna tell them.
-When?

499
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,775
-Now. This weekend.
-You sure?

500
00:42:31,983 --> 00:42:33,541
-Yeah, I'm sure.
-Really?

501
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:36,720
Kate, believe me.
I'm dying to tell them.

502
00:43:05,316 --> 00:43:07,716
Dougie? Dougie!.

503
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:10,385
Doug.

504
00:43:10,922 --> 00:43:13,322
Doug.
Hey, you're a captain now.

505
00:43:14,192 --> 00:43:15,682
Doug.

506
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:21,699
Come on. Come on.
Would you let him up for air, dear.

507
00:43:21,899 --> 00:43:23,628
Come on.

508
00:43:23,835 --> 00:43:26,599
I'll be a son of a bitch.

509
00:43:31,576 --> 00:43:33,373
Man, it's good to see you.

510
00:43:33,578 --> 00:43:34,909
Yeah, it's good to see you too.

511
00:43:35,113 --> 00:43:37,673
My brother Doug,
home from the merchant marine.

512
00:43:37,882 --> 00:43:40,350
Did you forget
how to use the phone?

513
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:42,781
Come on.
Move back, move back.

514
00:43:42,987 --> 00:43:44,716
He's been cruising
all over the world...

515
00:43:44,922 --> 00:43:47,516
...and he can't even get to the bar.
Come on.

516
00:43:47,725 --> 00:43:50,819
Ensign Dorsey. No, no--
Lieutenant, Captain Dorsey, huh?

517
00:43:51,028 --> 00:43:53,588
-Cool it with the merchant marine.
-What?

518
00:43:55,233 --> 00:43:57,963
-What?
-I didn't join the merchant marine.

519
00:43:58,403 --> 00:44:00,530
-Still got your sea legs?
-Shush.

520
00:44:00,738 --> 00:44:03,400
If you weren't with the merchant
marine, where were you?

521
00:44:03,908 --> 00:44:05,603
Let's go outside
and talk about this.

522
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:09,041
-We're all family here.
-Tell us about it, tell us about it.

523
00:44:10,448 --> 00:44:12,109
Come on. Tell me now.

524
00:44:13,017 --> 00:44:14,712
Come on, chief.

525
00:44:14,986 --> 00:44:17,147
Well, actually...

526
00:44:17,355 --> 00:44:18,913
...it's kind of interesting.

527
00:44:20,091 --> 00:44:21,581
Tell him.

528
00:44:26,898 --> 00:44:29,196
I've been doing a little....

529
00:44:29,901 --> 00:44:31,425
Been doing a little figure skating.

530
00:44:33,237 --> 00:44:34,636
-Damn.
-What'd he say?

531
00:44:35,606 --> 00:44:37,301
You been doing what?

532
00:44:37,775 --> 00:44:39,106
Finger painting?

533
00:44:42,713 --> 00:44:44,772
These people, they think
we can go all the way.

534
00:44:44,982 --> 00:44:46,916
All the way to where?

535
00:44:48,152 --> 00:44:52,054
To the nationals.
Walter, the cham--

536
00:44:52,256 --> 00:44:54,121
You just don't understand.

537
00:44:54,659 --> 00:44:56,286
Was it me? Was it something I did?

538
00:44:56,494 --> 00:44:58,223
I'm telling you, I'm good.

539
00:44:58,429 --> 00:45:01,694
Come on, Doug, you're a hockey
player. How good can you be?

540
00:45:02,233 --> 00:45:04,827
Face it. If you're lucky,
a year from now...

541
00:45:05,036 --> 00:45:08,665
...you'll be in a Snoopy costume
in the frigging lce Capades.

542
00:45:08,873 --> 00:45:11,205
You think I'd spend
1 5 hours a day, every day...

543
00:45:11,409 --> 00:45:13,502
...to win some consolation prize?

544
00:45:13,878 --> 00:45:15,436
I'm talking an Olympic gold medal.

545
00:45:15,913 --> 00:45:18,677
The girl. You're mixed up with
this broad. That's it, isn't it?

546
00:45:18,883 --> 00:45:22,182
-It's a great opportunity.
-It's figure skating.

547
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:23,751
And I like it.

548
00:45:25,189 --> 00:45:28,317
It's a lot goddamn harder than
playing hockey, I can tell you that.

549
00:45:28,526 --> 00:45:30,926
And the stuff we're doing,
it's gonna be different.

550
00:45:31,295 --> 00:45:34,787
The costumes, the music.
Everything is gonna be different.

551
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:36,661
You'll see.

552
00:45:41,138 --> 00:45:43,163
Are they gonna make you
shave your legs?

553
00:45:43,508 --> 00:45:45,032
Screw this. I don't even know why--

554
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:50,277
Gotcha.

555
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:56,349
Good. This is looking good.
Now....

556
00:45:56,554 --> 00:45:58,385
Oh, I like it.

557
00:45:58,589 --> 00:45:59,851
It's not too low, is it?

558
00:46:00,057 --> 00:46:03,083
Well, we don't want him to hide
his light under a basket, do we?

559
00:46:03,294 --> 00:46:07,958
Now, where to put this?
Here. Here.

560
00:46:08,232 --> 00:46:09,756
I know.

561
00:46:15,072 --> 00:46:17,040
Let's put it here.

562
00:46:17,341 --> 00:46:20,037
-What do you think you're doing?
-Just getting started.

563
00:46:29,854 --> 00:46:31,219
This is Mozart.

564
00:46:32,189 --> 00:46:35,681
-It's not us.
-The deal was that we had to listen.

565
00:46:36,561 --> 00:46:38,586
Kate, this is tired.

566
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:41,899
Ten thousand other skaters will cue up
the same boring crap.

567
00:46:42,333 --> 00:46:45,700
This doesn't get it done.
It's like the costumes.

568
00:46:45,903 --> 00:46:47,768
Let's be different.

569
00:46:48,005 --> 00:46:50,166
Let's kick a little ass.

570
00:46:50,374 --> 00:46:52,001
If you wanna see
some asses kicked...

571
00:46:52,209 --> 00:46:55,372
...why don't you throw on some jeans
and skate to this.

572
00:46:57,248 --> 00:46:59,409
If you wanna win,
you play it straight.

573
00:46:59,951 --> 00:47:02,215
This is boring.

574
00:47:06,123 --> 00:47:07,590
Unacceptable.

575
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:14,624
-Would you stop?
-Didn't work for you last time.

576
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:16,094
What?

577
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:18,268
You heard me.

578
00:47:18,469 --> 00:47:21,461
-You have some nerve.
-Just listen to my music one second!

579
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:22,934
Stop turning it!

580
00:47:24,375 --> 00:47:25,740
Guys.

581
00:47:26,777 --> 00:47:28,438
Hey!

582
00:47:30,881 --> 00:47:32,815
It's after midnight.

583
00:47:33,017 --> 00:47:34,780
I have a 6:30 appointment.

584
00:47:34,986 --> 00:47:36,749
We were just wrapping up.

585
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:42,121
Play him the Mozart.
You'll be asleep in no time.

586
00:47:47,231 --> 00:47:49,131
Katya, please try to understand.

587
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:51,324
Douglas is not boy. He is man.

588
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:53,503
Is young, vigorous man.

589
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:56,264
I don't care. He has three months
to qualify for nationals.

590
00:47:56,474 --> 00:47:58,601
-He needs every minute.
-Sure, sure. This I know.

591
00:47:58,809 --> 00:48:02,142
And he is back on Monday.
And he will be working much better.

592
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,271
Really?

593
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:07,884
Katya, please, you know.

594
00:48:08,085 --> 00:48:11,179
Solitude is....
Too much is not good, eh?

595
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:13,914
It's Christmas, we skate.
I have the flu, we skate.

596
00:48:14,125 --> 00:48:16,150
I have a boyfriend in London
that I never see.

597
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:19,454
I skate every day so that you can play
Dr. Frankenstein with this guy.

598
00:48:19,664 --> 00:48:22,132
I show up every morning
for seven months...

599
00:48:22,333 --> 00:48:25,928
...so that you can give him two days
to go off whoring in New York City?

600
00:48:26,137 --> 00:48:27,832
Is not entirely correct.

601
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:30,905
He went to Boston.

602
00:49:33,471 --> 00:49:34,802
If I get her any higher...

603
00:49:35,005 --> 00:49:38,338
...they'll need a putty knife to scrape
her off the ceiling. Am I right?

604
00:49:38,542 --> 00:49:40,703
-Are we ready for nationals or what?
-We will be.

605
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:43,573
-Celebrating? We haven't won yet.
-To you, Doug.

606
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:47,079
Who's ready to order?
I think I'll start with some vichyssoise.

607
00:49:47,718 --> 00:49:49,481
Five weeks to go.
Everything's clicking.

608
00:49:49,687 --> 00:49:51,416
We're gonna kick some tail.

609
00:49:51,622 --> 00:49:53,715
-Am I right?
-"Tail"? Excuse me?

610
00:49:53,924 --> 00:49:55,289
-Some beluga.
-I'm eligible.

611
00:49:55,493 --> 00:49:56,960
Doug Dorsey, licensed to thrill.

612
00:49:57,161 --> 00:49:59,186
Slow down, champ.
We've got a long way to go.

613
00:49:59,396 --> 00:50:01,956
-Trying to rain on my parade?
-Don't let her beat you down.

614
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:04,066
Hasn't happened by now,
he's in the clear.

615
00:50:04,268 --> 00:50:06,600
Standing there doing nothing.
Get our menu.

616
00:50:07,071 --> 00:50:09,835
-Now is not the time.
-Any specials or what?

617
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,507
Everyone's in such a great mood.

618
00:50:11,709 --> 00:50:14,735
-I'll throw another log on the fire.
-Hale, now is not the time.

619
00:50:14,945 --> 00:50:17,470
They'll find out sooner or later.
The fact is...

620
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:21,048
...I've asked Kate to marry me,
and she's accepted.

621
00:50:22,553 --> 00:50:24,851
-Fantastic.
-Oh, Hale, congratulations.

622
00:50:25,055 --> 00:50:26,886
-Thank you.
-Congratulations.

623
00:50:27,458 --> 00:50:29,289
-That's great.
-Katya, I want my kiss.

624
00:50:29,493 --> 00:50:31,586
Show them the ring, Kate.

625
00:50:31,796 --> 00:50:35,197
-Great. That's just great.
-Now, there's a piece of ice.

626
00:50:35,399 --> 00:50:37,697
Hale, I think I'm paying
you altogether too much.

627
00:50:37,902 --> 00:50:39,836
-What are you doing?
-We ready to order?

628
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:42,096
-Yeah.
-Sure.

629
00:51:40,464 --> 00:51:42,591
Still dropping that shoulder.

630
00:51:45,135 --> 00:51:46,625
I thought you'd retired.

631
00:51:48,172 --> 00:51:50,197
I changed my mind.

632
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:56,402
You know what I think
is the saddest thing about sports?

633
00:51:56,614 --> 00:51:58,946
People who stay too long
at the party.

634
00:51:59,984 --> 00:52:03,249
-What are you doing here, Rick?
-I'd like to see you go out a champion.

635
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:05,414
That's my plan.

636
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:09,421
If you wanted to skate so badly,
why didn't you come to me?

637
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:12,328
-I know we made some mistakes.
-Mistakes?

638
00:52:12,529 --> 00:52:15,157
You spent the last 1 0 years
tying me into knots.

639
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:16,896
You were always difficult.

640
00:52:19,303 --> 00:52:21,533
Know what the first thing
you said to me was?

641
00:52:21,739 --> 00:52:23,866
I was 9,
and you came into my building.

642
00:52:24,074 --> 00:52:25,268
And I was skating.

643
00:52:25,476 --> 00:52:28,240
And when I was finished,
I turned around...

644
00:52:28,445 --> 00:52:30,936
...and, oh, my God,
there was Rick Tuttle.

645
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:32,809
And you know what you said?

646
00:52:33,017 --> 00:52:36,043
You said, "Boy, do we have
our work cut out for us."

647
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,187
Still blaming Calgary on Brian?

648
00:52:39,623 --> 00:52:42,751
You meant a lot to this sport, Kate.
You still do.

649
00:52:43,761 --> 00:52:46,821
But nationals?
I mean, now, after all this time?

650
00:52:47,898 --> 00:52:50,958
I just hate to see you humiliated.

651
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:54,296
-Humiliated?
-Oh, come on. This guy.

652
00:52:54,505 --> 00:52:55,733
A hockey player?

653
00:52:56,707 --> 00:53:00,768
Let's face it. Trusting partners
was never your strong suit.

654
00:53:01,712 --> 00:53:03,942
This guy, this hockey player...

655
00:53:04,315 --> 00:53:06,408
...is the best skater
I've been on the ice with.

656
00:53:06,617 --> 00:53:09,108
He gonna make you cry,
he's so good.

657
00:53:11,956 --> 00:53:13,753
You know your way out.

658
00:53:29,239 --> 00:53:31,104
You let me down,
it'll take them a month...

659
00:53:31,308 --> 00:53:33,071
...to count the blade marks
up your back.

660
00:53:34,411 --> 00:53:36,572
Do me a favor, take off
the rock while we work.

661
00:53:37,381 --> 00:53:39,474
It's cutting the hell out of my hand.

662
00:53:48,659 --> 00:53:50,684
The United States
Figure Skating Association...

663
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:53,328
...welcomes you to the national
skating championships.

664
00:53:54,264 --> 00:53:56,858
Congratulations
and the best of luck.

665
00:53:58,936 --> 00:54:00,870
Douglas, free leg must be high.

666
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:03,596
Katya, head low.

667
00:54:03,807 --> 00:54:06,332
Yes, your body must be tight.

668
00:54:06,543 --> 00:54:08,773
-Like rush hour out here.
-Spindler and Nyman.

669
00:54:08,979 --> 00:54:10,241
They cry on command.

670
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:13,940
The Weiderman twins. Don't get too
close. You'll go into sugar shock.

671
00:54:15,019 --> 00:54:18,477
-Hey, isn't that--?
-Brian Neuman.

672
00:54:18,689 --> 00:54:21,021
-My old partner.
-The ex-husband.

673
00:54:21,225 --> 00:54:22,783
Who's the new wife?

674
00:54:22,993 --> 00:54:26,019
Pekurovsky. Lorie Pekurovsky.

675
00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:28,289
Tell me how you really feel.

676
00:54:32,569 --> 00:54:33,797
Well, Kate.

677
00:54:34,204 --> 00:54:37,662
-Surprise, surprise.
-Hello, Brian.

678
00:54:42,513 --> 00:54:44,981
No wonder you've been
keeping him to yourself.

679
00:54:53,023 --> 00:54:55,321
-What's the matter?
-Nothing.

680
00:54:55,526 --> 00:54:57,619
Don't worry. You'll get used to it.

681
00:54:58,195 --> 00:55:00,060
Yeah, right.

682
00:55:14,044 --> 00:55:15,238
Going down?

683
00:55:23,654 --> 00:55:25,713
You talked me into it.

684
00:55:32,296 --> 00:55:34,264
-Hello.
-Hey.

685
00:55:34,932 --> 00:55:36,797
-How you doing?
-I'm well.

686
00:55:37,801 --> 00:55:39,268
-See you around.
-Just get in?

687
00:55:39,470 --> 00:55:41,597
-Yes.
-I thought you were napping.

688
00:55:41,805 --> 00:55:44,069
I couldn't sleep. I wasn't tired.

689
00:55:47,978 --> 00:55:50,674
He has the self-control of a rabbit.

690
00:55:50,881 --> 00:55:52,644
Kate, what are you looking for?

691
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:54,283
Nothing. My earring.

692
00:55:54,485 --> 00:55:56,851
I spend four years working
my way back to nationals...

693
00:55:57,054 --> 00:55:59,318
...and what happens?
I'm skating to weird music...

694
00:55:59,523 --> 00:56:02,686
...with a partner who can't even follow
the simplest of instructions.

695
00:56:03,293 --> 00:56:04,954
Maybe he's got a problem sleeping.

696
00:56:05,162 --> 00:56:08,563
The only problem that he has
is finding his zipper fast enough.

697
00:56:08,999 --> 00:56:10,557
I thought they looked good together.

698
00:56:10,968 --> 00:56:13,163
You think this is funny?
We have to skate tonight.

699
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:15,770
-Now is the time to rest.
-Like you, huh?

700
00:56:16,807 --> 00:56:18,900
That's it. That is it.

701
00:56:19,843 --> 00:56:21,936
Call the front desk
and get a room of your own.

702
00:56:22,146 --> 00:56:25,047
I knew this wouldn't work out.
I can't even concentrate.

703
00:56:25,249 --> 00:56:27,410
I can't even find my lucky earring.

704
00:56:29,353 --> 00:56:30,945
Hello.

705
00:56:43,467 --> 00:56:46,231
This hasn't got anything
to do with skating, does it?

706
00:56:46,436 --> 00:56:48,961
-What does that mean?
-You're falling for him.

707
00:56:50,307 --> 00:56:52,275
-What?
-Doug.

708
00:56:52,643 --> 00:56:54,634
-Yes.
-You are. You're falling for him.

709
00:56:54,845 --> 00:56:56,642
-That's crazy.
-You think so?

710
00:56:56,847 --> 00:56:58,474
-You're nuts.
-Am l?

711
00:56:58,682 --> 00:57:01,116
-You see how we act together.
-Yes, I do.

712
00:57:01,318 --> 00:57:04,082
We never get along.
I mean, we're always fighting.

713
00:57:05,155 --> 00:57:06,247
Foreplay.

714
00:57:19,503 --> 00:57:22,233
-Okay, we're all in.
-You are not waiting for Hale?

715
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:25,567
He's not coming. He had to go up
to Boston. Business problems.

716
00:57:26,410 --> 00:57:27,468
Is okay with you?

717
00:57:27,678 --> 00:57:31,375
If you wanna worry about something,
worry about ramjet the rookie here.

718
00:57:32,583 --> 00:57:33,880
Who?

719
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:38,112
Let's go.

720
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:43,887
So here we are at night number four
of the U.S. national championships.

721
00:57:44,094 --> 00:57:46,756
The country's 12 best couples
are in the arena tonight.

722
00:57:46,964 --> 00:57:49,558
only two of these couples
will go on to the olympics...

723
00:57:49,766 --> 00:57:51,734
...in Albertville, France
six weeks from now.

724
00:57:51,935 --> 00:57:53,903
Tonight we're seeing
two and a half minutes...

725
00:57:54,104 --> 00:57:57,631
...in the compulsory moves before
tomorrow night's long program.

726
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:21,998
You look nervous.

727
00:58:23,033 --> 00:58:25,194
You look really nervous.

728
00:58:27,638 --> 00:58:29,663
How nervous are you?

729
00:58:31,041 --> 00:58:33,236
How nervous are you?

730
00:59:02,005 --> 00:59:03,768
I feel better.

731
00:59:03,974 --> 00:59:05,908
What is wrong with you?

732
00:59:06,176 --> 00:59:08,872
I always get tight before a game.

733
00:59:09,313 --> 00:59:10,280
Put it this way.

734
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:14,177
When I played hockey,
I used to have two helmets.

735
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:17,114
One for the game,
and one for just before.

736
00:59:17,321 --> 00:59:18,879
This just coming up now?

737
00:59:19,089 --> 00:59:21,148
Bad choice of words.

738
00:59:24,528 --> 00:59:27,554
Beautiful skating. Just beautiful.

739
00:59:33,737 --> 00:59:35,364
I don't believe this.

740
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:37,563
I'm fine. No problem.

741
00:59:37,774 --> 00:59:39,605
Don't sweat it.

742
00:59:42,612 --> 00:59:43,579
Look at me.

743
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:45,407
Miss Moseley, Mr. Dorsey,
you're on.

744
00:59:45,615 --> 00:59:47,583
Look at my eyes, look at my eyes.
That's good.

745
00:59:47,784 --> 00:59:49,911
Okay. Now smile.

746
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:51,678
Concentrate on my forehead.

747
00:59:51,888 --> 00:59:54,914
Okay. Now look at me and smile.

748
00:59:55,125 --> 00:59:58,117
There you go. There. Bigger.

749
00:59:58,328 --> 01:00:00,159
Okay. Now breathe.

750
01:00:00,364 --> 01:00:01,956
Breathe.

751
01:00:03,233 --> 01:00:04,928
Just don't breathe on me, okay?

752
01:00:05,135 --> 01:00:06,830
Look, it goes away.

753
01:00:07,037 --> 01:00:08,527
The worst it ever was...

754
01:00:08,739 --> 01:00:11,367
...I went out and scored six goals
in the first two periods.

755
01:00:11,575 --> 01:00:12,542
Next to skate...

756
01:00:12,743 --> 01:00:15,769
...Kate Moseley, Douglas Dorsey.

757
01:00:15,979 --> 01:00:18,243
Miss Moseley, Mr. Dorsey, please.

758
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:20,075
You're saying once
we get out there...

759
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:21,750
...everything will be fine?

760
01:00:21,952 --> 01:00:25,149
It usually only took me
about 1 0 minutes to relax.

761
01:00:25,355 --> 01:00:28,188
Our program is
two and a half minutes.

762
01:00:29,192 --> 01:00:32,184
So eight minutes after
we're done I'll be fine.

763
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,935
So here they are, former
U.S. champion Kate Moseley...

764
01:00:40,137 --> 01:00:42,833
...and ex-hockey star Doug Dorsey
at their first nationals.

765
01:00:43,039 --> 01:00:46,372
And what a place to make
your competitive debut.

766
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:14,166
Side by side double axels.
Here they come.

767
01:01:19,242 --> 01:01:20,334
And they nailed them.

768
01:01:20,544 --> 01:01:22,569
They nailed them just beautifully.

769
01:01:22,779 --> 01:01:26,408
What a night for U. S. pairs skating.
It's extraordinary.

770
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:30,051
Brian Neuman and Lorie Pekurovsky
into first place.

771
01:01:30,253 --> 01:01:32,653
Johnny and Jodie Weiderman
into the number two spot.

772
01:01:32,856 --> 01:01:36,553
And out of nowhere, Kate Moseley
and Doug Dorsey grab number three.

773
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:38,523
Two couples are all
the United States...

774
01:01:38,728 --> 01:01:40,719
...are allowed to send
to the olympic Games.

775
01:01:40,931 --> 01:01:44,492
Tomorrow night's long program
should be very exciting.

776
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:46,931
Man, this overnight thing is brutal.

777
01:01:47,137 --> 01:01:48,604
Why can't it be a double-header?

778
01:01:48,805 --> 01:01:51,000
Short program, long program,
same night.

779
01:01:51,241 --> 01:01:52,765
We're out of here.
Know what I mean?

780
01:01:52,976 --> 01:01:53,965
I know what you mean.

781
01:01:54,177 --> 01:01:57,146
It's like, enough already. It's like....

782
01:01:57,514 --> 01:01:58,811
What's the word?

783
01:01:59,015 --> 01:02:00,642
You know what word
I'm looking for?

784
01:02:00,851 --> 01:02:02,375
I don't know. Expectation?

785
01:02:02,586 --> 01:02:04,816
-No, no. When you....
-Anticipation?

786
01:02:05,021 --> 01:02:06,079
-Excitement?
-Foreplay.

787
01:02:08,191 --> 01:02:10,682
-Foreplay?
-Yeah, you know. Like foreplay.

788
01:02:10,894 --> 01:02:12,088
Yeah, I know what it means.

789
01:02:12,295 --> 01:02:14,559
Well, wouldn't you rather
just get right to it?

790
01:02:14,764 --> 01:02:16,755
-What?
-Skating.

791
01:02:16,967 --> 01:02:18,901
Long program.

792
01:02:19,503 --> 01:02:22,165
Chicago. Nationals.

793
01:02:22,706 --> 01:02:24,230
Flowers?

794
01:02:27,544 --> 01:02:28,704
Sleep.

795
01:02:28,912 --> 01:02:30,402
I'd rather sleep.

796
01:02:34,718 --> 01:02:35,980
Sleep?

797
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:48,162
Brian Neuman
and Lorie Pekurovsky.

798
01:02:48,365 --> 01:02:51,960
Beautiful skating. This assures them
a place on the olympic team.

799
01:02:52,168 --> 01:02:54,534
The remaining spot will
go to one of the two teams...

800
01:02:54,738 --> 01:02:57,866
...Ieft to skate: Moseley-Dorsey
or the Weidermans.

801
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:05,675
Kate Moseley and Doug Dorsey.

802
01:03:05,882 --> 01:03:08,578
What a performance.
Look at that sit spin.

803
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:11,913
This crowd knows it's seeing
history in the making.

804
01:03:12,122 --> 01:03:14,852
We're in for a major upset tonight.

805
01:03:33,243 --> 01:03:35,336
oh, yes. That was great skating.

806
01:03:35,545 --> 01:03:37,809
Clean, powerful,
and the crowd just loved it.

807
01:03:38,014 --> 01:03:40,448
-Fantastic.
-Are those for me?

808
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:42,444
Hey. You were great.

809
01:03:44,588 --> 01:03:46,715
5. 4, 5. 4, 5. 4....

810
01:03:46,923 --> 01:03:49,483
These are not great marks.
I expected much higher.

811
01:03:49,693 --> 01:03:51,160
Evidently, so did the crowd.

812
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:53,724
It's hard to explain
to people outside the sport...

813
01:03:53,930 --> 01:03:56,922
...but sometimes the scores
reflect more than what's on the ice.

814
01:03:57,133 --> 01:03:58,794
The judges have their favorites...

815
01:03:59,002 --> 01:04:01,596
...and they obviously don't include
Moseley and Dorsey.

816
01:04:01,805 --> 01:04:04,638
It looks like the Weidermans will join
Neuman and Pekurovsky...

817
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:06,968
...on the olympic team.

818
01:04:09,012 --> 01:04:10,479
This is horseshit.

819
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:14,446
What crap are they trying to pull?
We skated our asses off out there.

820
01:04:14,651 --> 01:04:16,084
You call this a sport?

821
01:04:16,286 --> 01:04:17,878
Bullshit.

822
01:05:01,865 --> 01:05:05,301
Just terrible. She stepped into
the spin, then I'm not sure...

823
01:05:05,502 --> 01:05:08,960
...but it looked like she got caught
in his lederhosen.

824
01:05:09,172 --> 01:05:11,470
You know what this means.

825
01:05:14,010 --> 01:05:15,841
We are in.

826
01:05:17,514 --> 01:05:20,381
Yeah. Yeah. We're going to France.

827
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:22,175
Parlez-vous Olympics?

828
01:05:25,088 --> 01:05:26,487
Sure you wanna do this?

829
01:05:26,690 --> 01:05:28,419
Whatever you're having.

830
01:07:10,627 --> 01:07:13,152
All right. We're here.

831
01:07:15,598 --> 01:07:17,088
Oh, boy.

832
01:07:19,435 --> 01:07:21,300
Okay.

833
01:07:28,611 --> 01:07:29,635
Wanna dance?

834
01:07:29,846 --> 01:07:31,177
No, I don't think so.

835
01:07:31,381 --> 01:07:32,871
Doug.

836
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:35,680
Douglas, you silly thing.

837
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:38,012
Please don't think.

838
01:07:39,589 --> 01:07:43,025
That's what I like about the way I feel.
Even if I tried to think, I couldn't.

839
01:07:43,226 --> 01:07:47,287
And I think too much,
and I think so long. And it's so tiring.

840
01:07:47,497 --> 01:07:51,160
The world is spinning
and spinning and spinning.

841
01:07:52,869 --> 01:07:54,598
Look....

842
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:59,101
Did you ever play with magnets?

843
01:07:59,309 --> 01:08:01,106
You used to have to
push them around...

844
01:08:01,311 --> 01:08:04,007
...and they'd push away and
you push them around the table?

845
01:08:04,214 --> 01:08:09,049
All you really had to do was
just flip them over, and suddenly....

846
01:08:16,292 --> 01:08:19,056
Don't you see? That's why
everything's been so awful.

847
01:08:19,262 --> 01:08:20,957
All we needed was a little flip.

848
01:08:21,164 --> 01:08:22,927
Kate, it's not right.
What about Hale?

849
01:08:23,132 --> 01:08:25,532
Oh, Hale shmale.

850
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:28,161
We're through.

851
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:34,134
Our engagement is off.

852
01:08:34,510 --> 01:08:36,068
Flip.

853
01:08:57,033 --> 01:08:58,625
Come on. Not tonight.

854
01:08:58,835 --> 01:09:00,132
Not like this.

855
01:09:00,336 --> 01:09:02,236
Not like what?

856
01:09:04,307 --> 01:09:06,172
Not like me?

857
01:09:07,377 --> 01:09:10,369
-Kate, you're bombed.
-What do you mean?

858
01:09:11,481 --> 01:09:14,382
That means that it's time
for you to go to bed.

859
01:09:14,584 --> 01:09:15,812
God, just what I need.

860
01:09:16,019 --> 01:09:18,112
Someone else telling me what to do.

861
01:09:18,321 --> 01:09:21,757
In case you've missed it,
I am throwing myself at you.

862
01:09:21,958 --> 01:09:23,619
I am tearing off my clothes...

863
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:26,818
...and you are giving me a rundown
on drinking dos and don'ts.

864
01:09:27,030 --> 01:09:28,588
Kate, why don't you calm--

865
01:09:28,798 --> 01:09:30,493
I get enough coaching
on the ice. Get out.

866
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:33,567
-You've got this all wrong.
-Do I ever.

867
01:09:34,904 --> 01:09:38,601
Excuse my surprise, but really,
what a disappointment.

868
01:09:39,375 --> 01:09:42,435
-What is that supposed to mean?
-Well, look at you.

869
01:09:43,246 --> 01:09:45,544
God's gift to reckless abandon...

870
01:09:45,748 --> 01:09:49,309
...revealed as nothing but a prude
in wolf's clothing.

871
01:09:51,287 --> 01:09:53,278
You're a lousy drunk.

872
01:09:53,489 --> 01:09:55,514
And you're a lousy date.

873
01:09:59,896 --> 01:10:01,864
It didn't have to be like this.

874
01:10:03,299 --> 01:10:05,062
I said, get out.

875
01:10:48,211 --> 01:10:49,803
Hi.

876
01:10:50,313 --> 01:10:52,281
I watched your program.

877
01:10:52,482 --> 01:10:55,246
You've got a great sit spin.

878
01:10:57,487 --> 01:11:01,116
I thought maybe
we could trade secrets.

879
01:11:52,341 --> 01:11:54,832
It's a little early for practice, isn't it?

880
01:11:55,211 --> 01:11:56,838
I'm sorry. I must have
the wrong room.

881
01:11:57,046 --> 01:11:59,514
Ask her for more towels, will you?

882
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:12,593
Kate.

883
01:12:13,196 --> 01:12:14,788
Kate.

884
01:12:14,997 --> 01:12:16,988
Kate, will you wait a minute? Kate.

885
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:18,758
Kate.

886
01:12:18,968 --> 01:12:20,333
Kate.

887
01:12:20,536 --> 01:12:21,935
-Kate.
-Don't. Don't even try it.

888
01:12:22,138 --> 01:12:23,628
Just looking at you makes me sick.

889
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:25,637
To think I was coming to apologize.

890
01:12:26,242 --> 01:12:27,368
Lorie Pekurovsky.

891
01:12:27,577 --> 01:12:29,875
Were you or were you not engaged
until last night?

892
01:12:30,079 --> 01:12:32,274
-Hardly the point.
-You threw me out of your room.

893
01:12:32,482 --> 01:12:34,143
She may not have
waited much longer.

894
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:36,784
-That's not how it happened.
-Spare me the details.

895
01:12:36,986 --> 01:12:38,510
-Where the hell do you get off?
-Me?

896
01:12:38,721 --> 01:12:39,813
This is my fault?

897
01:12:40,022 --> 01:12:42,650
From the first day, you treated me
like a hired hand.

898
01:12:42,859 --> 01:12:46,454
Then one night you get drunk,
I'm supposed to thank my lucky stars?

899
01:12:46,662 --> 01:12:48,823
I'm sorry. I don't downshift that fast.

900
01:12:49,031 --> 01:12:51,932
-Get out of my way.
-No problem.

901
01:12:52,135 --> 01:12:55,229
I've been practicing that move
for a year and a half.

902
01:13:00,743 --> 01:13:02,301
Blind date.

903
01:13:02,645 --> 01:13:03,746
So we have little problem, da?

904
01:13:03,746 --> 01:13:05,611
So we have little problem, da?

905
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:10,018
Good. We skip little problem...

906
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:13,814
...and go straight line
to big problem.

907
01:13:14,824 --> 01:13:18,851
"And what is big problem, coach?"

908
01:13:19,061 --> 01:13:21,996
Smilkov and Brushkin.

909
01:13:22,598 --> 01:13:23,758
"Who?"

910
01:13:23,966 --> 01:13:27,367
Smilkov and Brushkin.

911
01:13:28,104 --> 01:13:30,629
Last night they win
European Championship.

912
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:33,199
Perfect scores.

913
01:13:33,576 --> 01:13:37,842
Everybody's been blown away.
Contest is over.

914
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:41,539
Smilkov and Brushkin
are unbeatable.

915
01:13:41,984 --> 01:13:45,977
So hello Soviet surprise package.

916
01:13:46,189 --> 01:13:48,714
Goodbye gold medal.

917
01:13:49,892 --> 01:13:53,487
Of course, there is possible solution.

918
01:13:53,696 --> 01:13:58,793
But it's probably too dangerous.

919
01:14:10,346 --> 01:14:11,506
Where did these come from?

920
01:14:11,714 --> 01:14:13,477
For 20 years
I've been working on this.

921
01:14:13,683 --> 01:14:19,019
But you know, to have skaters,
to have situation, to have desire...

922
01:14:19,488 --> 01:14:20,819
...is not ready until now.

923
01:14:21,023 --> 01:14:24,424
What is this?
Is this a bounce spin into a throw?

924
01:14:25,661 --> 01:14:28,186
-You can't do that.
-The key to this is release.

925
01:14:28,397 --> 01:14:29,455
There can be no halfway.

926
01:14:29,665 --> 01:14:32,896
No. No. It's illegal.

927
01:14:34,670 --> 01:14:36,968
Is gray area.

928
01:14:37,173 --> 01:14:40,734
Bounce spin to a throw twist.
Then I catch her?

929
01:14:40,943 --> 01:14:42,740
Well, sort of.

930
01:14:43,713 --> 01:14:44,941
We can't do this.

931
01:14:45,147 --> 01:14:47,240
Why not? We have all the pieces.

932
01:14:47,450 --> 01:14:49,509
We have five weeks.

933
01:14:49,719 --> 01:14:51,186
The Pamchenko Twist.

934
01:14:52,521 --> 01:14:54,989
-Absolutely not.
-Expect us to name it after you?

935
01:14:55,191 --> 01:14:57,091
No, no. Is mistake.

936
01:14:57,293 --> 01:14:59,887
-ls not right time.
-This is good stuff. I can do this.

937
01:15:00,096 --> 01:15:02,462
-What are you saying? I can't?
-Hey, if the shoe fits.

938
01:15:02,932 --> 01:15:05,332
Hey, listen. I have been
competing for 1 3 years...

939
01:15:05,534 --> 01:15:09,231
...and nobody tells me
what I can or cannot do.

940
01:15:14,110 --> 01:15:16,374
Don't quit your day job.

941
01:15:20,916 --> 01:15:22,042
Okay, again.

942
01:15:23,386 --> 01:15:24,580
Again.

943
01:15:24,787 --> 01:15:25,754
Again, again.

944
01:15:25,955 --> 01:15:27,616
Again. Again.

945
01:15:31,527 --> 01:15:33,290
Katya, head up.

946
01:15:33,496 --> 01:15:37,159
Higher. Higher. She has to fly.

947
01:15:43,005 --> 01:15:46,031
-Are they gonna get it?
-Eventually.

948
01:15:46,242 --> 01:15:47,903
Before they kill each other?

949
01:15:51,881 --> 01:15:53,610
Release. Release must be total.

950
01:15:53,816 --> 01:15:55,943
Is no halfway. Halfway is bullshit.

951
01:15:56,152 --> 01:15:58,586
You go halfway, you get hurt.

952
01:16:08,030 --> 01:16:09,520
Higher.

953
01:16:09,732 --> 01:16:11,563
Much higher.

954
01:16:12,368 --> 01:16:15,303
We are needing an explosion.

955
01:16:50,239 --> 01:16:51,638
Kate?

956
01:16:53,142 --> 01:16:55,838
I was just looking at
the pictures of mother.

957
01:17:01,717 --> 01:17:03,275
I can hear her now:

958
01:17:03,486 --> 01:17:04,680
"The Olympics."

959
01:17:07,556 --> 01:17:09,387
It's what she always dreamed of.

960
01:17:11,627 --> 01:17:12,958
Look at this thing.

961
01:17:13,429 --> 01:17:15,056
Just sitting here empty.

962
01:17:17,833 --> 01:17:19,926
We're almost there, honey.

963
01:17:20,669 --> 01:17:21,931
I can taste it.

964
01:17:22,138 --> 01:17:24,197
What if it stays empty?

965
01:17:24,407 --> 01:17:25,635
Not this time.

966
01:17:26,308 --> 01:17:28,902
-Go to bed. You need your rest.
-I'm not tired.

967
01:17:29,111 --> 01:17:30,373
-Kate.
-No.

968
01:17:31,447 --> 01:17:33,415
What are we doing?

969
01:17:35,618 --> 01:17:37,916
Why am I doing this?

970
01:17:39,422 --> 01:17:41,390
It's what you've always wanted.

971
01:17:42,291 --> 01:17:43,724
Always?

972
01:17:47,129 --> 01:17:49,597
-Kate--
-I know.

973
01:17:50,266 --> 01:17:51,426
I'm going.

974
01:17:51,634 --> 01:17:55,035
These little pep-talks
can be so exhausting.

975
01:18:40,783 --> 01:18:42,580
Opening ceremonies,
you enjoyed yourself?

976
01:18:42,785 --> 01:18:44,776
-Oh, it was great.
-Cold and great.

977
01:18:44,987 --> 01:18:48,753
So, Doug, what's the difference
between this and hockey?

978
01:18:48,958 --> 01:18:50,357
The women.

979
01:18:50,860 --> 01:18:53,294
What's the feeling?
Everybody out for themselves...

980
01:18:53,496 --> 01:18:56,260
...or is there a team spirit building?

981
01:18:56,465 --> 01:18:59,195
-Oh, we're definitely a team.
-Definitely.

982
01:18:59,768 --> 01:19:01,633
There's a real sense
of togetherness.

983
01:19:01,837 --> 01:19:04,237
-Spirit.
-Spirit.

984
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:05,407
Family.

985
01:19:05,608 --> 01:19:09,408
It's-- It's sort of.... It's almost....

986
01:19:09,612 --> 01:19:11,341
-It's almost--
-Orgasmic.

987
01:19:12,047 --> 01:19:13,639
What did she say?

988
01:19:14,717 --> 01:19:16,981
-The Russians.
-The Russians.

989
01:19:17,219 --> 01:19:18,686
Nikolai?

990
01:19:19,355 --> 01:19:20,822
-Nikolai?
-Can we get a photo?

991
01:19:21,023 --> 01:19:23,218
You guys gonna be here a while?

992
01:19:46,749 --> 01:19:48,307
You forgot a button.

993
01:19:48,517 --> 01:19:50,451
No, I like it open.

994
01:19:51,754 --> 01:19:53,449
Well, it looks terrible.

995
01:19:53,656 --> 01:19:55,351
It pulls at my neck.

996
01:19:58,027 --> 01:20:00,393
Well, you should've
mentioned that in Chicago.

997
01:20:00,596 --> 01:20:01,995
Enough.

998
01:20:09,572 --> 01:20:11,164
Button it.

999
01:20:11,674 --> 01:20:13,232
We're on.

1000
01:20:15,177 --> 01:20:16,804
Good luck.

1001
01:20:20,783 --> 01:20:23,013
Representing the United States
of America...

1002
01:20:23,218 --> 01:20:24,185
...Moseley and Dorsey.

1003
01:20:24,386 --> 01:20:27,184
-Button the goddamn button.
-Get over it.

1004
01:20:27,389 --> 01:20:29,983
You are an immature asshole
of the lowest order.

1005
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:33,421
If it was 40 below and that button...

1006
01:20:33,629 --> 01:20:35,756
...meant the difference
between a long life...

1007
01:20:35,965 --> 01:20:37,865
...and a horrible death
from hypothermia...

1008
01:20:38,067 --> 01:20:40,627
...I still wouldn't give you
the satisfaction.

1009
01:20:41,503 --> 01:20:42,470
Skate.

1010
01:21:06,729 --> 01:21:08,162
A technically superior program...

1011
01:21:08,364 --> 01:21:10,457
...but did you feel
there was something missing?

1012
01:21:10,666 --> 01:21:13,567
Absolutely. They delivered all
the short-program required moves...

1013
01:21:13,769 --> 01:21:15,100
...but it seemed very cold.

1014
01:21:15,304 --> 01:21:18,330
As if we were seeing two strangers,
rather than a fluid pair.

1015
01:21:19,375 --> 01:21:22,242
It just didn't look like
they were having fun out there.

1016
01:21:24,847 --> 01:21:26,212
Hey, Doug...

1017
01:21:26,415 --> 01:21:29,282
-...was the altitude a problem tonight?
-No.

1018
01:21:31,086 --> 01:21:34,613
Long program. We've been hearing all
week about your new surprise move.

1019
01:21:34,823 --> 01:21:37,314
-What's it called?
-The Pamchenko.

1020
01:21:37,526 --> 01:21:40,359
-The Pamchenko. Is it named after--?
-We're not doing it.

1021
01:21:40,562 --> 01:21:42,587
-What?
-We're taking it out of the program.

1022
01:21:42,798 --> 01:21:44,493
It's not ready.

1023
01:21:45,367 --> 01:21:46,698
Doug?

1024
01:21:48,771 --> 01:21:50,295
A button?

1025
01:21:50,506 --> 01:21:52,371
-What in hell are you thinking of?
-Me?

1026
01:21:52,574 --> 01:21:54,405
Yes, you. What the hell
is in your head?

1027
01:21:54,610 --> 01:21:56,100
He's making like this is my fault.

1028
01:21:56,311 --> 01:21:58,711
You didn't deliver.
What, you want a pat on the back?

1029
01:21:58,914 --> 01:22:00,677
When did I become
the designated asshole?

1030
01:22:00,883 --> 01:22:02,282
What happened?
Ask the ice queen.

1031
01:22:02,518 --> 01:22:04,782
-Enough of that.
-When you're done, Jack...

1032
01:22:04,987 --> 01:22:09,424
...you can tell me why I spent 5 weeks
on a move she was never gonna do.

1033
01:22:09,625 --> 01:22:11,650
-You're out of line.
-I needed the gold medal.

1034
01:22:11,860 --> 01:22:13,657
Forget it.
We can win without the move.

1035
01:22:13,862 --> 01:22:16,695
-lmpossible.
-Where the hell were you during this?

1036
01:22:16,899 --> 01:22:19,197
Where was l? I was babysitting.

1037
01:22:19,401 --> 01:22:22,063
Loud and clear, folks:
Losing gracefully does nothing for me.

1038
01:22:22,271 --> 01:22:26,071
-Think about that in the future.
-That what you told Brian in Calgary?

1039
01:22:28,143 --> 01:22:31,044
You can kid all you want about
what happened. I've seen the tapes.

1040
01:22:31,246 --> 01:22:33,043
Brian was getting it done.

1041
01:22:33,482 --> 01:22:35,677
Ask him. He'll tell you.

1042
01:22:36,218 --> 01:22:37,947
All right, Douglas, is enough.

1043
01:22:38,153 --> 01:22:39,381
Today it's about a button.

1044
01:22:39,588 --> 01:22:42,056
You people are all excuses.
You wanna point a finger--

1045
01:22:42,257 --> 01:22:44,919
-You goddamn son of a bitch.
-Gotta find that go-to guy.

1046
01:22:45,127 --> 01:22:47,095
You should've started
with a go-to girl, Jack.

1047
01:22:47,296 --> 01:22:48,558
-That cuts it.
-He's right.

1048
01:22:48,764 --> 01:22:50,095
What?

1049
01:22:50,466 --> 01:22:52,434
He's right. He is.

1050
01:22:55,337 --> 01:22:57,134
All of it.

1051
01:22:58,040 --> 01:23:03,068
We worked so hard for two years.
And I just went and threw it all away.

1052
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:13,818
-Why did you stay with me?
-Kate, don't.

1053
01:23:15,457 --> 01:23:17,391
Don't what?

1054
01:23:17,893 --> 01:23:20,123
Tell the truth?

1055
01:23:21,597 --> 01:23:23,326
We can't buy back
what happened today.

1056
01:23:25,167 --> 01:23:27,135
We can't start over.

1057
01:23:28,137 --> 01:23:30,469
Do you think I look at myself,
at what I've become...

1058
01:23:30,672 --> 01:23:32,606
...and do you think I'm proud?

1059
01:23:33,809 --> 01:23:35,071
What do you want?

1060
01:23:36,478 --> 01:23:38,673
I don't know.

1061
01:23:40,649 --> 01:23:43,641
I guess I would like to go back
to the beginning and have you say...

1062
01:23:43,852 --> 01:23:46,753
...win or lose,
I could just be your daughter.

1063
01:23:52,060 --> 01:23:54,028
You came every day,
and you skated.

1064
01:23:56,165 --> 01:23:58,895
This must've been
like a nightmare for you.

1065
01:24:04,339 --> 01:24:07,502
I didn't know it was gonna
end up like this.

1066
01:24:13,982 --> 01:24:15,540
I'm sorry.

1067
01:24:20,722 --> 01:24:23,350
I'm so sorry. For everything.

1068
01:24:28,063 --> 01:24:30,293
Please excuse me.

1069
01:24:40,776 --> 01:24:42,869
I'm going for a walk.

1070
01:26:02,824 --> 01:26:05,657
Kate. What's this?

1071
01:26:07,796 --> 01:26:11,197
I'm going over with my father.
Anton has the other car.

1072
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:13,300
He'll take you over
when you're ready to go.

1073
01:26:13,502 --> 01:26:17,131
-No, I'm talking about the bags.
-I'm catching the 6:30 flight tonight.

1074
01:26:17,339 --> 01:26:19,603
Tonight? After we skate?

1075
01:26:19,808 --> 01:26:21,469
The house is paid up
for two weeks...

1076
01:26:21,677 --> 01:26:24,703
-...so stay as long as you like.
-Kate, wait. What are you saying?

1077
01:26:24,913 --> 01:26:27,711
-lf this is about yesterday--
-I'm retiring.

1078
01:26:30,185 --> 01:26:31,379
What?

1079
01:26:34,923 --> 01:26:37,323
This afternoon is my final skate.

1080
01:26:38,393 --> 01:26:40,520
-Kate, come on--
-You'll be fine.

1081
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:44,791
You won't have any trouble
finding another partner.

1082
01:26:47,936 --> 01:26:52,202
Of course, they won't have
my wonderful slap shot.

1083
01:26:54,242 --> 01:26:56,267
I gotta go get ready.

1084
01:27:45,460 --> 01:27:48,054
Beautiful extension.
Very classy.

1085
01:27:48,263 --> 01:27:49,662
Executed very nicely.

1086
01:27:49,865 --> 01:27:52,629
I hope they can keep it
going to the finish.

1087
01:28:04,746 --> 01:28:07,840
Neuman and Pekurovsky
looking well-positioned for a medal.

1088
01:28:08,050 --> 01:28:11,542
Still to skate are Smilkov-Brushkin
and Kate Moseley and Doug Dorsey.

1089
01:28:24,032 --> 01:28:27,001
Do you know what I think
would be wonderful?

1090
01:28:27,569 --> 01:28:32,131
If you would go out there today
and skate for these people...

1091
01:28:32,340 --> 01:28:35,070
...the way I have seen you skate.

1092
01:28:38,180 --> 01:28:40,740
Enjoy each other.

1093
01:29:04,639 --> 01:29:07,107
What's the matter?

1094
01:29:07,309 --> 01:29:08,276
Nothing.

1095
01:29:08,477 --> 01:29:11,378
-Are you all right?
-Fine.

1096
01:29:21,957 --> 01:29:23,720
Kate, I'm sorry.

1097
01:29:23,925 --> 01:29:26,416
My timing--
I know it stinks, but....

1098
01:29:26,628 --> 01:29:28,789
I just keep thinking
this thing with us....

1099
01:29:28,997 --> 01:29:30,259
It's gonna go away.

1100
01:29:30,465 --> 01:29:33,400
I keep thinking if I can just keep
moving and checking...

1101
01:29:33,602 --> 01:29:35,900
...I'll get clear, but....

1102
01:29:36,104 --> 01:29:37,969
Do you understand
what I'm telling you?

1103
01:29:38,173 --> 01:29:41,370
-I don't wanna fight anymore.
-No. I mean, yeah, I don't wanna fight.

1104
01:29:41,576 --> 01:29:43,874
-Look, we have to skate.
-This won't wait.

1105
01:29:44,079 --> 01:29:46,240
Kate, maybe I wasn't ready.
Maybe--

1106
01:29:46,448 --> 01:29:48,678
Maybe you didn't give me much
of a chance. Maybe--

1107
01:29:48,884 --> 01:29:51,751
I don't know. I just-- I just--

1108
01:29:51,953 --> 01:29:53,545
Nine-six.
Nine-three.

1109
01:29:56,424 --> 01:29:59,655
Kate, somewhere in the middle
of all this I fell in love with you.

1110
01:30:01,730 --> 01:30:04,198
You may take the ice.

1111
01:30:04,399 --> 01:30:08,062
I'm saying I love you.
I'm saying it out loud.

1112
01:30:20,115 --> 01:30:21,946
Don't say we're not right
for each other...

1113
01:30:22,150 --> 01:30:24,243
...because we may not be right
for anybody else.

1114
01:30:24,452 --> 01:30:27,819
-You have to go on.
-Will you shut up a minute.

1115
01:30:28,023 --> 01:30:31,117
It can't be any harder to stay together
than it was to stay apart.

1116
01:30:31,326 --> 01:30:33,260
-Thirty seconds.
-Will you wait a minute.

1117
01:30:35,163 --> 01:30:36,255
Kate.

1118
01:30:37,199 --> 01:30:39,497
I need you.

1119
01:30:41,503 --> 01:30:42,663
I need you.

1120
01:30:54,516 --> 01:30:56,313
We're doing the Pamchenko.

1121
01:30:57,052 --> 01:30:59,247
-What?
-Oh, you heard me.

1122
01:30:59,454 --> 01:31:01,615
Think I'm doing this
to get a program out of you?

1123
01:31:01,823 --> 01:31:03,222
You wanna win, don't you?

1124
01:31:03,925 --> 01:31:05,825
No. It's no good, Kate.
It's too dangerous.

1125
01:31:06,861 --> 01:31:09,227
Then we agreed.
We're putting it in.

1126
01:31:13,702 --> 01:31:14,930
-It's out.
-It's in.

1127
01:31:15,136 --> 01:31:16,125
-Out.
-ln.

1128
01:31:16,338 --> 01:31:17,600
-Out.
-ln.

1129
01:31:20,008 --> 01:31:22,340
-What difference does it make?
-The difference is...

1130
01:31:22,544 --> 01:31:25,035
...I'm in the mood to kick a little ass.

1131
01:33:05,914 --> 01:33:08,644
-You didn't have to.
-Yes, I did.

1132
01:33:09,517 --> 01:33:11,041
Why?

1133
01:33:12,721 --> 01:33:14,154
Because I love you.

1134
01:33:16,991 --> 01:33:19,357
Just remember
who said it first.
