1
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,338
When I was a boy of nine, I read a book
called The Malay Archipelago,

2
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,789
by the great 19th century naturalist,

3
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:24,100
the co-proposer with Charles Darwin

4
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:27,178
of the theory of evolution
by natural selection,

5
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,428
Alfred Russel Wallace. This is it.

6
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:34,048
And in it he describes his travels
and explorations

7
00:00:34,149 --> 00:00:35,978
through Borneo and Sumatra,

8
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:38,978
eastwards through the islands
that are now Indonesia

9
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:41,700
to the western end of New Guinea.

10
00:00:41,789 --> 00:00:46,899
And in it, I saw one illustration
that thrilled me to the marrow.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,789
It shows greater birds of paradise
displaying in the forests of New Guinea

12
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:55,189
and being hunted
by native plume hunters.

13
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,590
It seemed to me then as now, that to see
the greater bird of paradise in display

14
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:03,899
must be one of the most thrilling sights
in nature.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,349
And it became my childhood ambition
to go and do just that.

16
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,659
Well, it's taken me 60 years,
but here I am.

17
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:24,739
(People chattering)

18
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,310
I first tried to see the birds back in 1957.

19
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,188
But then
I could only get to eastern New Guinea,

20
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,989
where the species Wallace saw
doesn't occur.

21
00:01:39,069 --> 00:01:43,900
And there was another problem -
the people used the plumes as money.

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,349
These are wedding gifts - pearl shells,
mats sewn with cowrie shells

23
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:52,420
but, most valuable of all
birds of paradise skins,

24
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:55,980
prepared in the traditional way by cutting
off the legs and the wings,

25
00:01:56,069 --> 00:02:00,019
to fully reveal the plumes.
There were 21 of them.

26
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,459
The bride seemed pleased, but for us,
looking for live birds,

27
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,150
there was worse to come -

28
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,180
a celebratory dance.

29
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:15,330
Each man wore plumes
of at least 40 birds of paradise,

30
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,658
of several different kinds.

31
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:21,658
Most astonishing were the sawtooth
quills they wore through the nose.

32
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,818
These came from
the King of Saxony's bird, that then,

33
00:02:24,908 --> 00:02:28,340
very few naturalists had even seen alive.

34
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:31,500
There seemed little chance of finding
living birds here,

35
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:34,340
so we decided to go into wilder country
to the north.

36
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,110
The headman called for porters.

37
00:02:38,188 --> 00:02:40,460
We got 50. Once in the mountains,

38
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:46,818
our baggage was taken over by people
who didn't wear feathers in their hair.

39
00:02:46,908 --> 00:02:51,419
Instead, they had huge wigs,
covered with bark cloth.

40
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,188
We heard calls of birds of paradise,
we glimpsed them high in the trees,

41
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,150
but we couldn't find a place
where we could film them.

42
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:06,150
And then, after three weeks
one morning at dawn,

43
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,990
our luck changed.

44
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,710
Low down, in a casuarina tree

45
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,710
a plumed bird of paradise.

46
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,180
And there, his unplumed female.

47
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,750
With these pictures,
we had achieved something.

48
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,348
As far as I knew
this was the first film ever taken

49
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:28,419
of a bird of paradise
displaying in the wild.

50
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,188
But our film was not in colour

51
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,870
the species was smaller than the one
that Wallace had seen

52
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,710
and there were not
a dozen dancing birds,

53
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,389
there was just one.

54
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:43,818
This was hardly the fulfilment
of that boyhood ambition.

55
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:48,580
But now, 40 years on, I'm trying again.

56
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,468
Wallace arrived in the Far East in 1854

57
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,830
but it was three years before he caught
the first glimpse

58
00:03:57,908 --> 00:03:59,460
of a living bird of paradise.

59
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,188
And even then
it must have been a very distant one.

60
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,990
For, as he wrote, the birds only display
in the loftiest of trees.

61
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,949
And they are doing so in this one,
right here.

62
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:24,930
I reckon they are at least a hundred feet
above the ground.

63
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:32,110
Even with modern binoculars, it isn't
easy to see exactly what they are doing.

64
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,620
As far as I know
Wallace wasn't able to climb the tree

65
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,910
to get a closer view of the birds,

66
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,069
but these days we've got ways
of doing so relatively simply.

67
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,310
You fire a thin line, with a catapult,
over one of those high branches,

68
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:53,379
haul up a thicker rope,
attach a system of counterweights,

69
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:57,350
then all you have to do,
is to clip yourself on, and up you go.

70
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:17,139
Down goes the counterweight.

71
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,750
And now, I'm leaving that dark world
of the forest floor

72
00:05:23,829 --> 00:05:26,500
and really entering
a completely new one.

73
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,709
Now I'm getting up into the canopy.

74
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,990
Into the world of the birds of paradise.

75
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,910
And here's the top.

76
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:52,230
The birds are in another emergent tree,
just like this one,

77
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:55,819
and I've got an absolutely clear view
of them.

78
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,149
It's unlikely
that they're going to take fright

79
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,389
at my sudden appearance
above the canopy,

80
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:05,910
because they've been using that tree
for generation after generation,

81
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,778
and it will take a lot more than just me
to put them off it.

82
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:19,699
This, at last
is Wallace's picture come to life.

83
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,670
He was the first European to glimpse this
extraordinary spectacle,

84
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,860
and he knew well
in general terms, what was happening.

85
00:06:26,949 --> 00:06:29,778
This is a female
and she's come to pick a mate

86
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:33,060
from among the gorgeous males
who are displaying.

87
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:49,379
A young male. He's dancing even though
he hasn't yet got his plumes.

88
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,629
They don't develop
until he's six or seven years old.

89
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,550
There are several young males here,
putting in a little dancing practice.

90
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,550
This, however
is almost certainly a female,

91
00:07:15,629 --> 00:07:19,139
because the males are starting
the second stage of their performance -

92
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,470
the bow, head down.

93
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:34,740
The female has hopped onto the perch
of the male of her choice -

94
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:37,500
that's a straight invitation to mate.

95
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,870
Act Ill - the approach.

96
00:07:45,949 --> 00:07:47,899
Head up.

97
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,350
Act IV - the first physical contact.

98
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,338
It looks rough, but presumably she likes
this sort of treatment.

99
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:27,019
She could easily move away if she didn't.

100
00:08:35,668 --> 00:08:37,620
And that's it.

101
00:08:42,548 --> 00:08:44,850
And now there's another
to be attended to.

102
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,308
Apparently, there's a queue
on this particular perch.

103
00:09:00,908 --> 00:09:03,370
This is all he does as a father.

104
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,149
Now she'll fly away
and raise her young unaided.

105
00:09:10,788 --> 00:09:13,980
The males on the other perches,
in spite of all their efforts,

106
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,190
have no success at all.

107
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,418
He's at it again!

108
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,418
But his partner is not reacting properly.

109
00:09:30,509 --> 00:09:32,500
She's facing away from him.

110
00:09:35,149 --> 00:09:37,940
He's got it wrong, this is a young male.

111
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,220
All the matings are taking place
on this perch, with this male.

112
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,350
But are the females choosing the perch
or the dancer?

113
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,389
It's difficult to tell.

114
00:09:51,028 --> 00:09:53,778
But it's easy to see
why these wonderful plumes

115
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:56,168
should be so treasured by local people,

116
00:09:56,269 --> 00:10:01,019
and why, when the first examples
arrived in Europe in the 16th century,

117
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,190
they should have created a sensation,
as they did.

118
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:09,019
Those first specimens
had been prepared in the traditional way,

119
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,190
and had neither wings nor feet, and the
books of the time showed them that way.

120
00:10:14,269 --> 00:10:18,139
But how could such creatures
fly or perch?

121
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,070
This book explained.
The birds had no need to do either

122
00:10:22,149 --> 00:10:25,259
because they floated in the sky,
feeding on dew,

123
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,028
and only fell to earth when they died.

124
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,500
They were literally birds of paradise.

125
00:10:31,908 --> 00:10:35,980
Even 200 years later, the illustrations
involved a lot of guesswork.

126
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,190
For still no European
had seen the living birds.

127
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:42,019
This kind, for example,
had not only feathers,

128
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,788
but 12 long, naked quills
sprouting from its flanks.

129
00:10:46,788 --> 00:10:51,418
The artist did give it legs, but he was
completely baffled by the plumes.

130
00:10:52,269 --> 00:10:56,500
By the end of the 19th century, thanks to
the discoveries of Wallace and others

131
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,190
the illustrations are much more accurate.

132
00:10:59,269 --> 00:11:02,379
This is that 12-quilled bird again.

133
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,750
But could it really have its strange quills,
or wires, as they're called,

134
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,190
bent back over its body like this?

135
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:11,019
It seems hardly likely.

136
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,950
Perhaps the artist had been working
from a specimen

137
00:11:14,028 --> 00:11:15,658
that had been badly packed.

138
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,500
And what about this?

139
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,350
This is the sicklebill bird of paradise.

140
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,190
Could it, in life, have great fans of
plumes projecting above its wings,

141
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:28,860
like fancy epaulettes with a purple rim?

142
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:40,139
Even today,
some of these species are little-known.

143
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:45,259
Many display in the thick forest at dawn,
when there is not enough light to film.

144
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,750
That was what had caused us
such problems 40 years ago.

145
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:53,308
But now we can resolve that difficulty
with special video cameras.

146
00:11:53,389 --> 00:11:55,820
And one of the species
I most wanted to see

147
00:11:55,908 --> 00:12:00,019
is that bird with the improbable
epaulettes, the black sicklebill.

148
00:12:01,028 --> 00:12:04,980
Its display in the wild
has never been photographed or filmed,

149
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,788
it hasn't even been scientifically
described.

150
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:14,580
But the local people say that a male
does display on a perch just near here,

151
00:12:14,668 --> 00:12:19,220
but it only does so at first light,
just before dawn.

152
00:12:20,269 --> 00:12:24,700
So the only thing to do,
is to sit down and wait.

153
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,470
He's there!
That dim, black shape on the sapling.

154
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,428
This really is seeing in the dark.

155
00:12:44,028 --> 00:12:45,580
(Calling)

156
00:12:46,629 --> 00:12:50,980
He's calling to attract females,
but also to keep other males away.

157
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,389
This is his territory
and he'll dance by himself.

158
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:03,220
Those things like arms are not his wings,
they're those epaulettes.

159
00:13:05,149 --> 00:13:07,220
So that's what he does with them!

160
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,190
It's even more unlikely than the drawing.

161
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,990
It's getting brighter.

162
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:38,028
Soon we should be able to see him
just a little more clearly.

163
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,668
There's that purple line on the epaulette.

164
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,509
But there's still no sign of a female.

165
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,058
Ah, well, obviously time for breakfast.

166
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,350
A pandanus tree. Sicklebills
are particularly fond of its fruit,

167
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,668
and there's lots of it around.

168
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:36,428
That's what he's after - and there's
a female half-hidden in the leaves.

169
00:14:44,788 --> 00:14:46,379
There's a second female.

170
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,509
A third!

171
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,548
All three are almost certainly his mates,

172
00:15:01,629 --> 00:15:05,580
each building her own nest
and feeding in his territory.

173
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:12,899
Many birds of paradise species
have females coloured like this -

174
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,149
brown above
and speckled or barred beneath.

175
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,190
And looking at them, it's easy to see
that they're all related,

176
00:15:20,269 --> 00:15:24,019
even though their males
are so very different and various.

177
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,230
The New Guinea forest
has an atmosphere all its own.

178
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,028
From one point of view,
it's rather disappointing -

179
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:38,710
you don't see many mammals, far fewer
than in Africa or South American forests.

180
00:15:38,788 --> 00:15:42,899
But what this place lacks in mammals,
it makes up for in birds.

181
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,028
Not that it's all that easy to see them.

182
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,788
You know they're around
because you can hear them,

183
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:53,538
but if you want to watch them,
you have to move fairly quietly.

184
00:16:02,548 --> 00:16:05,538
And there is one of the smallest
of the whole family.

185
00:16:05,629 --> 00:16:09,168
This is the one with those extraordinary
sawtooth plumes -

186
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:11,220
the King of Saxony's bird.

187
00:16:16,908 --> 00:16:21,538
There's nothing else remotely like these
plumes in the whole of the bird world.

188
00:16:32,269 --> 00:16:34,220
He's calling for a female.

189
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:46,269
And it's not just his plumes that are
unique - so is his way of dancing.

190
00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:49,220
(Soft hissing)

191
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,350
That hissing noise is his call.

192
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,149
You can tell he's getting
particularly excited

193
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,910
because he's erected the black feathers
on his shoulders into a cape,

194
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,380
another of those transformation tricks

195
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,038
that seem to be a speciality
of this family.

196
00:17:19,348 --> 00:17:23,298
He's so worked up,
he's trying to mate with a tuft of moss!

197
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,630
A female, at last.

198
00:17:47,509 --> 00:17:49,660
Typical female colouring.

199
00:18:48,588 --> 00:18:51,338
And that's never been filmed before.

200
00:18:59,509 --> 00:19:01,259
New Guinea is a huge island.

201
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:06,259
A thousand miles long from east to west,
lying between Australia and the equator.

202
00:19:06,348 --> 00:19:10,338
It was rucked up from beneath the sea
some 10,000,000 years ago,

203
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,230
as Australia drifted northwards

204
00:19:12,308 --> 00:19:16,009
and pushed against the Asian section
of the earth's crust.

205
00:19:16,108 --> 00:19:20,298
The ancestors of the birds of paradise,
probably starling-like creatures,

206
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,098
slowly spread from Asia,
down chains of smaller islands

207
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,190
until they reached these vast forests.

208
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,630
And here, they evolved into
a multitude of wildly different species,

209
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,230
that, between them, exploit every kind
of feather adornment you can imagine.

210
00:19:38,269 --> 00:19:43,210
But why did this great diversity
of species come into existence?

211
00:19:43,308 --> 00:19:46,980
Well, New Guinea
as well as being an immense island,

212
00:19:47,068 --> 00:19:49,500
is also an extremely varied one.

213
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:55,220
Up here, I'm at 11,000 feet, and the land
is much poorer in food for birds

214
00:19:55,308 --> 00:20:00,380
than the luxuriant tropical rainforests
of lower altitudes.

215
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,470
And up here,
there lives a bird of paradise

216
00:20:03,548 --> 00:20:08,700
that may give us a clue about
the ancestors of the whole family.

217
00:20:10,588 --> 00:20:12,140
McGregor's bird of paradise.

218
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,150
And there's an obvious way in which
it differs from most of its relations.

219
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,858
This is a pair - male and female
look exactly the same.

220
00:20:26,028 --> 00:20:29,730
The reason they do so
is connected with food.

221
00:20:30,788 --> 00:20:34,660
There's so little of it up here,
that if nestlings are to get enough,

222
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:37,460
the male has to help the female
to collect it.

223
00:20:38,548 --> 00:20:40,538
So he can't have a lot of wives.

224
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,108
Just one.

225
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,548
And since he can't, therefore
spend his time dancing in trees,

226
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:51,028
he hasn't developed an extravagant
costume in which to show off.

227
00:20:51,108 --> 00:20:55,420
His courtship is no more than
this quick chase through the bushes.

228
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,230
At lower altitudes
things are very different.

229
00:21:09,308 --> 00:21:14,058
The tropical heat and the heavy rains
produce a really rich environment.

230
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:18,630
As there are no monkeys to munch
the fruit or squirrels to gather the seeds,

231
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,390
there's plenty of food for birds.

232
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,910
Here the females can raise their young
unaided

233
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,950
and the males can concentrate
on dancing.

234
00:21:27,028 --> 00:21:29,660
And since there are no cats or jackals,

235
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:32,980
there's little danger in doing so
on the ground.

236
00:21:34,108 --> 00:21:37,019
The superb bird of paradise
does just that.

237
00:21:37,108 --> 00:21:40,298
And this log is his dancing stage.

238
00:21:42,788 --> 00:21:44,858
As well as his spectacular cravat,

239
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,230
he's got a long sheaf of feathers
at the back of his neck.

240
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:51,740
Extraordinary in itself,
but you wait till he unfurls it!

241
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:57,108
Here's the female.
Now there'll be some action.

242
00:22:35,548 --> 00:22:39,088
This is the arena
of another displaying bird.

243
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,670
I'm not on the mainland
I've come to the island of Batanta

244
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,578
which is separated
by quite a narrow strait.

245
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:49,509
But it has its own species
of bird of paradise,

246
00:22:49,588 --> 00:22:51,970
that evolved here
and lives nowhere else.

247
00:22:52,068 --> 00:22:54,818
And one way of trying to get a look at it,

248
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:59,588
is to put some leaves on this arena,

249
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:03,509
because this bird is meticulously tidy.

250
00:23:13,828 --> 00:23:18,618
This isn't him. This is a pheasant pigeon.

251
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:24,990
Maybe a trespasser on his patch will so
infuriate him that he will come down.

252
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,509
(Bird calling)

253
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,868
(Calling continues)

254
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,910
I can hear his calls.

255
00:23:38,308 --> 00:23:39,858
There he is.

256
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,910
(Calling)

257
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:44,858
Wilson's bird of paradise.

258
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:50,670
He's got his own fashion gimmick -
the bald look.

259
00:23:54,028 --> 00:23:57,338
There goes the first
of the leaves that I dropped.

260
00:24:01,028 --> 00:24:04,858
He's really quite small -
only the size of a starling.

261
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:40,750
Now he's starting cutting leaves.

262
00:24:40,828 --> 00:24:42,940
Littering the place up himself.

263
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:52,548
Presumably he wants to get more light
on the stage,

264
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,068
so that his colours show up.

265
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,470
That looks like a female.

266
00:25:20,548 --> 00:25:24,940
She's got a slightly less brilliant
blue head.

267
00:25:38,548 --> 00:25:40,700
But that's a young male.

268
00:25:40,788 --> 00:25:46,420
He's not yet got coloured feathers on his
body, but his bald head is very blue,

269
00:25:46,509 --> 00:25:48,858
and he's behaving like a male too.

270
00:25:50,308 --> 00:25:53,980
ls he helping the boss
by doing a bit of the housework?

271
00:25:54,068 --> 00:25:55,660
Probably not.

272
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:59,528
It's more likely he's come here
to practise the skills he's going to need

273
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,098
when he's old enough
to have an arena of his own.

274
00:26:08,788 --> 00:26:10,740
She looks interested.

275
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,150
So does he.

276
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,630
(Calling)

277
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:09,048
He's clearly not much of a dancer.

278
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:12,990
But with a costume like that
who would need to be?

279
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,108
What an amazing bird!

280
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,230
I've seen lots of coloured illustrations
of them

281
00:27:28,308 --> 00:27:30,740
I've seen mounted specimens
in museums

282
00:27:30,828 --> 00:27:34,980
but nothing has prepared me
for the splendour of this wonderful thing.

283
00:27:35,068 --> 00:27:40,190
It's as though it's illuminated from
inside, the colours are incandescent.

284
00:27:41,548 --> 00:27:47,420
When Wallace collected
a particularly spectacular specimen,

285
00:27:47,509 --> 00:27:53,608
he wrote in his book, "My heart began to
beat violently, blood rushed to my head,

286
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:56,470
"and I felt more in danger of fainting

287
00:27:56,548 --> 00:28:00,740
"than when I had been in apprehension
of immediate death.

288
00:28:00,828 --> 00:28:03,700
"I had a headache
for the rest of the day."

289
00:28:03,788 --> 00:28:08,298
Well, I haven't got a headache,
but I think I know how he felt.

290
00:28:16,348 --> 00:28:20,220
Half a dozen of the 40-odd species
dance on the ground like that.

291
00:28:20,308 --> 00:28:25,250
To find another, we left the island of
Batanta and went back to the mainland

292
00:28:25,348 --> 00:28:28,220
to the Arfak mountains
in western New Guinea.

293
00:28:28,308 --> 00:28:30,338
The home of the Arfak parrotia.

294
00:28:34,788 --> 00:28:36,980
This is his display ground.

295
00:28:37,068 --> 00:28:39,980
Here too the forest floor
has been cleared

296
00:28:40,068 --> 00:28:43,058
and the saplings stripped of their leaves.

297
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:48,509
He's dressed entirely in black, except for
that white disc on his forehead.

298
00:28:48,588 --> 00:28:51,500
Though there is a iridescent patch
on his chest

299
00:28:51,588 --> 00:28:53,700
that he can reveal when he wants to.

300
00:28:53,788 --> 00:28:56,900
And he does have
those six black pennants on his head.

301
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,670
But he dazzles his mates
not so much with his costum' e

302
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,778
as with his choreography.

303
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:08,230
And that being so, he is particularly keen
on clearing his stage

304
00:29:08,308 --> 00:29:11,578
of anything that might trip up a dancer.

305
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:35,950
Now he's miming, going through the
motions of clearing away leaves,

306
00:29:36,028 --> 00:29:37,980
even though there aren't any.

307
00:29:44,028 --> 00:29:47,460
The stage is now absolutely immaculate.

308
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:57,180
And here's another of those juveniles

309
00:29:57,269 --> 00:30:01,298
who come to the arenas
of their elders and betters to practise.

310
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:27,380
Amazing! But how sad
that none of the girls are here to watch.

311
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,660
The master is back.

312
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,230
An audience is assembling.

313
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,538
He is going to show
how it should be done.

314
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:06,269
First, the warm-up - ritualised runs
across the stage.

315
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,750
A little more mimed leaf-clearing.

316
00:31:22,509 --> 00:31:25,460
Mounting excitement in the dress circle.

317
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,269
And now, the performance begins.

318
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,910
The absence of ground predators,

319
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,348
that has allowed some birds of paradise
to display on the ground,

320
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,868
has been exploited
by another family of birds,

321
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,430
that used to be thought to be
close cousins of the birds of paradise,

322
00:32:44,509 --> 00:32:47,259
but are now thought to be
somewhat distantly related.

323
00:32:47,348 --> 00:32:49,910
and this is one of their constructions.

324
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,538
This is not a nest, it's a jewel box.

325
00:32:54,308 --> 00:32:57,980
And these are not eggs,
they are blue berries.

326
00:32:58,068 --> 00:33:00,420
The treasures of a male bowerbird.

327
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,390
And here is one of those
treasure-hoarding capitalists,

328
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,190
the flamed bowerbird.

329
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,509
He may not have elaborate plumes,

330
00:33:18,588 --> 00:33:22,058
but his body feathers
could scarcely be more brilliant.

331
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:25,940
Those on his shoulders
have a gloss like spun glass.

332
00:33:35,588 --> 00:33:38,578
But this is about all he does
to display them.

333
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:41,308
It's as if his ancestors
once had big plumes,

334
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,700
and although he hasn't inherited them,

335
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:46,940
he still goes through the motions
of displaying them.

336
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:54,420
Whether that is so or not
he now puts his faith in his jewels.

337
00:33:54,509 --> 00:33:57,578
And here's another
to add to that collection.

338
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:05,509
Now he's chewing up leaves into a paste.

339
00:34:05,588 --> 00:34:09,130
Perhaps he's trying to beautify
the bower walls.

340
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:12,980
The abundance of food in the forest

341
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:15,630
has had the same effect
on the bowerbird family

342
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:18,380
as it has on their cousins
the birds of paradise.

343
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,150
It's enabled the males
to become polygamists.

344
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:27,340
But whereas birds of paradise attract
their wives with plumes on their bodies,

345
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,190
these birds do it with jewels
and their bowers.

346
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:38,909
And like plumes, the bowers have been
elaborated to an extraordinary degree.

347
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,909
Like this one, for example.
This is a maypole bower.

348
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:47,429
The builder - a drab little bird.

349
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:50,099
But then, he relies even less
on his feathers

350
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:53,340
and much more on his skill
as an architect and builder.

351
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:58,539
And he's got something
to be really proud of.

352
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,230
He decorates
this impressive construction

353
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,590
with green lichen around the base.

354
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,309
And from the end of the twigs
of the tower, he hangs frass -

355
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,349
caterpillar droppings.

356
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:37,739
He does have the vestiges
of a yellow crest.

357
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:41,500
And he's a quite extraordinary songster.

358
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,829
And several of these males will build
their towers

359
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,949
quite close to one another in the forest.

360
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:53,460
The females tour them
make up their minds,

361
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:55,539
presumably about which is the finest,

362
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:59,539
and then mate with the architect
beside his creation.

363
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:07,460
They then go away and rear their young
entirely by themselves.

364
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:15,590
The father of this nestling
may never even see it.

365
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:25,018
He spends nine months of the year close
to his award-winning building,

366
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:30,340
hoping, no doubt, that yet another
passing female will give him her vote.

367
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:45,150
And this is the work of the master builder
among bowerbirds.

368
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:50,059
I'm in the Vogelkop on the far western tip
of New Guinea

369
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:54,500
and this is the bower
of the Vogelkop bowerbird.

370
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:59,449
And what an astonishment it is! Surely
one of the wonders of the natural world.

371
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:02,940
The bower
has been completely roofed over,

372
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:06,940
thatched with these stems of orchids.

373
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:10,380
It's been built
around the base of a sapling,

374
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,630
it has a stark pillar right in the middle,

375
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:17,780
and it's got two smaller pillars
on the side, to support it.

376
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:22,789
The whole of the treasury
is five or six yards across.

377
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:27,190
And what treasures it contains!
Or what a variety of treasures it contains!

378
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:32,590
On the far side, there are the black stems
of tree ferns.

379
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:38,699
Here is the lawn
neatly planted with moss, and on it,

380
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:42,469
the shiny wing covers of beetles.

381
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:46,659
There are orange fruit, there are these
glowing orange dead leaves,

382
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:51,909
These are the acorns of the tropical oaks
which are common around here.

383
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,070
Behind me, there are black fruits.

384
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:59,619
All of which has been brought specially
by the bird.

385
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:05,099
Bowerbirds are so dedicated
to their work

386
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:08,099
that even if you sit out in the open
beside the bower

387
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:12,340
they will often continue to work,
provided you sit absolutely still.

388
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:32,389
This Vogelkop bowerbird
is the plainest of his family,

389
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,510
with no sign whatever of a crest.

390
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:37,420
But the more spectacular the display
in your bower,

391
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:41,780
presumably the less need you have to
impress your mate with bright feathers.

392
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,750
And it's difficult to imagine

393
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:47,268
a more impressive collection
of treasures than this.

394
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:54,849
But they do have to be properly arranged

395
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,070
to show them off really well.

396
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:27,579
Flowers, whenever they appear
in the forest

397
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:32,980
have an obvious appeal to a bird who
has a passion for interior decoration.

398
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,309
From one point of view, these
adornments are better than feathers.

399
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:54,518
Individual birds of paradise cannot
choose their plumes' shape and colour.

400
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:58,260
They have to display with what their
genes have given them.

401
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,920
Bowerbirds, however, can choose.

402
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,018
If a male decides that he stands a better
chance of seducing a female with pink,

403
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:10,300
rather than blue
then he can decorate his bower that way.

404
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,630
So it's the tastes and fancies
of the females, single mothers,

405
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:28,179
who have no need of the help of the male
in bringing up their families,

406
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:31,110
that has led
to these extravagant exhibitions.

407
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:38,860
Whether or not the bowerbirds are
closely related to the birds of paradise,

408
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:44,190
both families have reacted in remarkably
similar ways to the asset they share -

409
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:47,030
the huge richness of this forest.

410
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:50,300
This really is a paradise for birds.

411
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,429
And the variety of bowers it has allowed
one family to build

412
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:58,260
is more than matched by the variety
of plumes evolved by the other.

413
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:01,510
One group of female birds of paradise,
for example,

414
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:05,699
fancied glossy throats,
and this is the result.

415
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,909
The splendid astrapia.

416
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:14,150
Tails clearly didn't impress them
to anything like the same degree.

417
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:26,739
But the splendid astrapia has
a close cousin, Shaw Mayer's astrapia,

418
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:29,300
and those females had different tastes.

419
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,030
They were hot for tails.

420
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:35,940
There's no wonder that the result of their
selections over many generations

421
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:39,179
is also called
the ribbon-tailed bird of paradise.

422
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,469
The female has to sit on a nest
and a long tail would get in the way,

423
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:47,820
but because of her
and her forebears' decisions

424
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,949
about what makes a male attractive

425
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:55,260
he now has the longest tail in proportion
to his body of any bird in the world.

426
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:13,510
The smallest member of the family -
the king bird of paradise.

427
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:18,139
He has yet another kind of tail -
two wire-like quills,

428
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:21,619
each tipped with a little green disc
like a coin.

429
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:24,980
Not so obviously impressive
as the ribbon-tail

430
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:27,449
but wait till you see
what he does with them.

431
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:37,018
Wingspreads and an extraordinary,
scarcely birdlike, call

432
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:39,139
are just the beginning of things.

433
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:41,690
Just attention-grabbing ways

434
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:45,909
to let any female around know
that he's on his perch,

435
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,699
and about to display his prowess
as an acrobat and a juggler.

436
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:12,309
What could be more attention-grabbing
than that?

437
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:33,420
But that's not all. When he's really
excited, he's got a final stunt -

438
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:35,460
the pendulum.

439
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:41,659
There it is.

440
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:48,300
Down in the lowlands

441
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:52,829
in the swamps beside the rivers,
lives the 12-wired bird of paradise.

442
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:57,389
He comes to his display post
in the early dawn.

443
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:02,940
This is the bird I used to think
had been drawn so inaccurately,

444
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:05,699
but the old illustration was right -

445
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:09,909
the wires, the quills,
are indeed bent back in a tangle.

446
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,829
The female doesn't have them.

447
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,510
But do bent-back quills
appeal to a female?

448
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:35,539
They're hardly beautiful.

449
00:44:57,510 --> 00:45:00,460
Courtship seems to be
some kind of game,

450
00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:04,300
a variation of I'm The King Of The Castle,
perhaps.

451
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,349
Only, with a very special prize.

452
00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:32,210
He deliberately brushed her face
with his rear quills!

453
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,030
He's doing it again!

454
00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:55,059
It seems that she prefers to be seduced,
not by visual thrills, but by tactile ones.

455
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:09,789
And after the quill flick, the beak poke.

456
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:45,670
It may be an odd technique, but it works.

457
00:46:56,110 --> 00:46:59,940
I've now left New Guinea,.
I'm 200 miles to the west

458
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:04,340
on the island of Halmahera
one of the Malukus, the Spice Islands.

459
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:09,460
It was here that Wallace made perhaps
his most spectacular discovery of all -

460
00:47:09,550 --> 00:47:12,500
a completely unknown bird of paradise.

461
00:47:12,590 --> 00:47:17,780
On that today carries his name -
Wallace's standardwing.

462
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:21,659
It was only observed once more

463
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,349
in the hundred years that followed
his discovery.

464
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:28,710
And until recently, some people feared
it might have disappeared altogether.

465
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,710
So it is one of the least-known
of all species.

466
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,550
But we do know that the males

467
00:47:33,630 --> 00:47:36,699
like the greater bird,
which Wallace made so famous

468
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,750
display in groups, and at dawn.

469
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:41,949
They've gathered in one of these trees,

470
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:45,179
and from the racket
I'd guess there are 30 or 40 of them.

471
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,469
(Many birds calling)

472
00:47:48,510 --> 00:47:51,460
The standards -
those long isolated feathers -

473
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:54,420
project not from the tail, the flank
or the head

474
00:47:54,510 --> 00:47:57,900
but, would you believe,
the front-edge of the wings.

475
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,179
These are advertising flights -

476
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:07,989
whizzing vertically into the air to show
passing females what's going on.

477
00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:23,340
There he goes again.

478
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:54,150
I've been watching this perch
since very first light,

479
00:48:54,230 --> 00:48:57,539
and I must have seen
at least a dozen displays,

480
00:48:57,630 --> 00:49:00,739
but not one of them has ended
with a mating.

481
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:04,789
I think that's because this
is one of the junior perches,

482
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:09,949
the subsidiary ones.
The senior perch, where all the action is,

483
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:12,179
is over there in a much taller tree.

484
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:14,739
That's where males are winning mates.

485
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,909
A female.

486
00:50:05,190 --> 00:50:08,889
This male is certainly putting on
a great performance.

487
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:32,059
ls she, in fact, assessing and comparing
the displays?

488
00:50:57,030 --> 00:51:00,139
A copulation.
As ever, a matter of seconds.

489
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,869
Another! Same place.

490
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:14,739
There seems little, to my eye at least,

491
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:17,829
to choose between all
the several dozen males.

492
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:21,389
And I don't see how a female
could make a proper choice.

493
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:25,510
Maybe it is the perch in these
great assemblies of competing males

494
00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:27,219
that is the important thing.

495
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:31,630
As it also may be among
the greater bird of paradise.

496
00:51:31,710 --> 00:51:34,340
If that is so, then in these mass displays,

497
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:37,590
the males are not so much showing off
to the females

498
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:40,340
as posturing aggressively
to one another.

499
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:44,110
Using their plumes to demonstrate
their strength and vigour,

500
00:51:44,190 --> 00:51:46,539
as stags do with their antlers.

501
00:51:46,630 --> 00:51:50,170
That would enable them to establish
a ranking between them all,

502
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:53,789
and the boy at the top of the rank
gets the number one perch.

503
00:52:00,510 --> 00:52:04,099
One of the mysteries about birds
of paradise, as far as I'm concerned,

504
00:52:04,190 --> 00:52:07,500
is why, when they have
such wonderful colours

505
00:52:07,590 --> 00:52:11,420
do they do so much of their displays
in the semi-darkness before dawn?

506
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:13,619
It's only now that the sun is up

507
00:52:13,710 --> 00:52:18,300
that I can really see the full beauty
of these wonderful plumes.

508
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,909
The displays are over.

509
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,699
It's time to get smartened up again
after all that rough and tumble.

510
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:29,590
The white standards are looking
a bit bedraggled too,

511
00:52:29,670 --> 00:52:33,579
and at last I can see exactly how
they're attached to the front of the wing.

512
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:40,179
ls there a more elegant cravat, in both
shape and colour, worn by any bird?

513
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:42,230
I doubt it.

514
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:54,699
So, after weeks of work and travel

515
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:57,949
with cameramen
Richard Kirby and Mike Potts,

516
00:52:58,030 --> 00:53:01,539
we had filmed the displays
of not just one species,

517
00:53:01,630 --> 00:53:05,900
but representatives of all
the major groups of birds of paradise.

518
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:09,469
And I had achieved
the ambition of a lifetime.

519
00:53:15,070 --> 00:53:18,690
Wallace's emotions
on discovering such marvels

520
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:22,500
must surely be echoed
by all of us who follow him.

521
00:53:22,590 --> 00:53:24,500
This is what he wrote -

522
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:31,110
"I thought of the long ages of the past,
during which the successive generations

523
00:53:31,190 --> 00:53:33,820
"of these things of beauties
have run their course

524
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:40,590
"year by year being born and living and
dying amid these dark, gloomy woods,

525
00:53:40,670 --> 00:53:44,059
"with no intelligent eye to gaze
upon their loveliness,

526
00:53:44,150 --> 00:53:47,619
"to all appearances,
such a wanton waste of beauty.

527
00:53:47,710 --> 00:53:50,420
"lt seems sad that, on the one hand

528
00:53:50,510 --> 00:53:56,739
"such exquisite creatures should live out
their lives and exhibit their charms

529
00:53:56,840 --> 00:54:00,869
"only in these wild,
inhospitable regions.

530
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:03,230
"This consideration must surely tell us

531
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:07,469
"that all living things
were not made for man.

532
00:54:07,550 --> 00:54:10,659
"Many of them have no relation to him

533
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:14,750
"Their happiness and enjoyments,
their loves and hates

534
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:16,989
"their struggles for existence,

535
00:54:17,070 --> 00:54:22,860
"their vigorous life and early death
would seem to be immediately related

536
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:26,739
"to their own wellbeing
and perpetuation alone."

537
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,750
Indeed so.
