<i>Sharkboy was not always
half shark, half boy. </i>

2
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,960
<i>He was a marine biologist -
or, at least, in training. </i>

3
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,440
<i>His father studied great white sharks</i>

4
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,720
<i>and called his son "Sharkboy" because of
how much he loved to care for the sharks. </i>

5
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,480
<i>He made them sushi
and had given them all names:</i>

6
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,120
<i>Goodmilk, Peggy, Eggbat... </i>

7
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,840
<i>and Crackett. </i>

8
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:40,960
<i>But one day
an incredible, mysterious storm appeared. </i>

9
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,800
<i>It swept away the entire laboratory. </i>

10
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,960
Sharkboy!

11
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,920
<i>Thanks to their life rafts,
Sharkboy and his father survived. </i>

12
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,760
<i>But they survived
on different sides of the wreckage,</i>

13
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,000
<i>each floating off in a different direction. </i>

14
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,360
Sharkboy!

15
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,600
<i>Sharkboy was completely alone. </i>

16
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,240
<i>Almost completely. </i>

17
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,040
<i>But one of the sharks recognized him. </i>

18
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,840
Hey, it's Sharkboy.

19
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,440
Don't take a bite outta him, boys -
he's a friend.

20
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,800
<i>They took Sharkboy to their cave home,
where he'd be safe and dry. </i>

21
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,560
<i>His new family were sharks. </i>

22
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,120
<i>Hundreds of sharks. </i>

23
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,400
<i>The sharks raised him
as one of their own,</i>

24
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,200
<i>training him in the ways of the shark. </i>

25
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,800
You must keep moving to survive.

26
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,600
Always go forward, never back.

27
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,960
<i>To live by instinct and instinct alone. </i>

28
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:58,560
<i>Eventually he grew gills,
and sharp talons for claws. </i>

29
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,160
<i>His teeth sharpened themselves
to a point. </i>

30
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:06,080
<i>He grew fins - all sorts of fins. </i>

31
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,240
<i>But that was years ago. </i>

32
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,720
<i>I first met Sharkboy
while fishing on the dock this summer. </i>

33
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,920
<i>He seemed lost. </i>

34
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,600
- You have to get a job!
- No, I have a job!

35
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,520
<i>So I snuck him home... </i>

36
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,760
Then maybe you should just leave.

37
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,720
<i>... when my parents
were too busy to notice. </i>

38
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,000
<i>I kept him fed and in water. </i>

39
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,120
<i>He had been traveling the universe
in search of his father. </i>

40
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:52,160
<i>He told me of his latest adventures
on a planet so cool it makes you drool. </i>

41
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,760
<i>He said I too
could go to Planet Drool someday. </i>

42
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,640
<i>Then one night
I was visited by a glowing light. </i>

43
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:07,040
<i>An amazing girl with purple flames for hair
and skin of molten lava rock appeared. </i>

44
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,520
<i>I called her... </i>

45
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,480
Lavagirl.

46
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,960
<i>She smiled at me,
for that seemed to be her name. </i>

47
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,960
<i>She told me she needed Sharkboy
to return to Planet Drool with her,</i>

48
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,520
<i>for a great crisis was developing. </i>

49
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:25,640
<i>She asked if I could go with them. 
I told her, "I have school tomorrow. "</i>

50
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,360
<i>She gave me a sad look
and flamed away,</i>

51
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,800
<i>taking Sharkboy with her. </i>

52
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,960
<i>I haven't seen Sharkboy
or Lavagirl since then. </i>

53
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,440
And that's what I did this summer.

54
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,840
Enough!

55
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,520
Someone is picking that up.
And it's not gonna be me!

56
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,800
We were supposed to tell true stories.

57
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,760
<i>That is a true story.</i>

58
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,600
- Does Lavagirl have special powers?
- There's no such thing as Lavagirl.

59
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,200
She can...

60
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,480
She can shoot lava out of her hands.

61
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,760
Cool.

62
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,440
How many people think
Max's story is true?

63
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,120
- Not true.
- Made up.

64
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,920
- Not true.
- It's just a made-up story.

65
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:25,000
If it's true, why don't you bring
Sharkboy and Lavagirl to class tomorrow?

66
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,560
They went away.
I don't know where they went.

67
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,080
Have a seat, Max.

68
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,400
Linus, you're next.

69
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,520
This summer, I met a new friend...
who was half dork, half boy.

70
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,680
I called him Dorkboy.

71
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,240
But his real name was Max.

72
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:52,920
We had him for dinner, but he stunk
so bad that we all blew chunks.

73
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,000
That's enough, Linus.

74
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,360
Linus, Max, stay.

75
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,080
Come on, Mr. E!

76
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,240
Class, what's my name?

77
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,400
Mr. Electricidad.

78
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,960
Mr. Electricidad, exactly.

79
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,920
Not Mr. Electric,
not Mr. Electrici-tha-tha-tha-tha.

80
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,240
Linus, you just earned a minus
for your behavior today.

81
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:24,360
This is a new year.
Do you think you can be friends?

82
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,640
No.

83
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,680
Then it's been decided:
You'll be the best of friends.

84
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,440
Which means
no more picking on Max, Linus.

85
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,360
Max.

86
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,040
You're in the fourth grade.
There are some good kids in this class.

87
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,400
Find them. Make friends with them.

88
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:47,200
Dreaming keeps you from seeing
what's right here in front of you.

89
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,280
This isn't a dream.
This is the real world.

90
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,000
Lost my train of thought.

91
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,160
No dreaming. Got it.

92
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,000
I'll try harder.

93
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,160
What do you have there?

94
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,720
It's my dream journal.

95
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,800
It has all of my most precious dreams in it.

96
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,360
I'll never part with it
for as long as I live.

97
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,800
You're a good kid, Max.

98
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,800
Max!

99
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,760
<i>Let's be imaginary friends.</i>

100
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:34,120
You can try and hang with us...
and we'll pretend you don't exist!

101
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,600
Check it out.
Sharkboy gets shocked by electric eels,

102
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,680
and then they feed on his cooked flesh.

103
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,560
Wow, Linus.

104
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,840
Your skills are... weak.

105
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,800
Ohh...

106
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,880
I'm gonna burst your bubble, Dream Boy.

107
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,360
You're dead!

108
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,440
Get the book!

109
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,120
Give me the book.

110
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:23,000
Hand over the book,
or you'll visit the dream world!

111
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,360
Ooh...

112
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,520
Agh-haa...

113
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,680
All right! Got it!

114
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,840
I'll bring you a revised edition tomorrow.

115
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,000
<i>- Max, wake up!
- Dream, Max. </i>

116
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:17,000
<i>- Open your eyes, Max. 
- Eyes open, and dream. Stay dreaming. </i>

117
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,960
<i>Wake up!</i>

118
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,640
Sharkboy!

119
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,080
And Lavagirl!

120
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,040
Hyah!

121
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,520
Max!

122
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,960
My cookies! My giant cookies!

123
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,320
What are you doing baking sweets? You
know what happens when he eats sugar.

124
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,360
I baked them for his class.

125
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,680
So you could make friends at school,
and now you've eaten all of them.

126
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,520
No, it was Sharkboy and Lavagirl!

127
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:25,000
Look - this one has shark bites,
and this one is singed.

128
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,800
There's no such thing
as Sharkboy and Lavagirl.

129
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,240
Well, I believe him.

130
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,000
Your mother's right. When you go to sleep
and close your eyes, they may come back.

131
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,720
But when you open 'em again, Sharkgirl
and Lavaboy'll be... outta here.

132
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,800
- But...
- Shh. Mouth closed, eyes closed.

133
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,280
- Now?
- Yes, now.

134
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:53,480
You can wait till you're in bed
to close your eyes, Max.

135
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,600
Kids need their dreams.

136
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,720
Kids... need to grow up!

137
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,960
<i>He's not making any friends
with these cookies!</i>

138
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,000
There's no such thing
as Sharkboy and Lavagirl.

139
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,480
There's no such thing
as Sharkboy and Lavagirl.

140
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,080
Yes, there is.

141
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,160
Stupid plugs!

142
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:32,800
Please don't let me have to go to school.
They'll make fun of me, I know it!

143
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,920
I wish I could just escape this loser world
and go to Planet Drool.

144
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,160
Games and toys and laughs and fun...

145
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:51,160
May there be terrible storms,
rain, sleet, snow, tornadoes...

146
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:58,000
so I can lay here all day tomorrow
and dream of Drool.

147
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,600
Guess I didn't dream hard enough.

148
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,400
There are plenty of good opportunities.
You just need to look.

149
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,840
Ooh, traffic engineer!

150
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,200
Hey.

151
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,960
I was cleaning out my closet
and look what I found.

152
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,920
Remember Tobor?
The robot you tried to build?

153
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,520
Why were you cleaning out your closet?

154
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,720
I had to find one of these.

155
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,560
<i>- Is Mom making you get a real job again?
- Writing is a real job.</i>

156
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,440
- When it pays.
- Max, I'm walking you to school today.

157
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:59,240
So what do you say?
Wanna finish making Tobor?

158
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,320
It won't work.

159
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:05,480
- Well, how do you know?
- 'Cause you told me it wouldn't.

160
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,520
I did?

161
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,760
I'm sorry.
I should've never said that.

162
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,320
It's OK. You were right.

163
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,760
Dumb idea.

164
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,840
How did these happen?

165
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,280
The grass was dead anyway.

166
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,560
Why are you so morbid?

167
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:35,040
I just wish anything could happen
so I wouldn't have to go to school today.

168
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,400
That's not realistic, Max.

169
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:41,440
It's bad enough your father's head
is in the clouds, but not you too, OK?

170
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,000
Just push that dream aside and move on.

171
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:50,120
Like with your dream?
The one about you and Dad and me?

172
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,200
Well, I do have a dream about us,

173
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:56,480
but, as I'm sure you've been noticing lately,
your father and I are just...

174
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,160
Well, we're... not compatible.

175
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:05,360
Sorry. I don't mean to dump all this on you
right before you have to go to school, but...

176
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,160
school's waiting.

177
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,480
Did we have to move so close to school?

178
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,320
Your father thought
we'd save money on gas.

179
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:17,560
Come right home after school today, 'cause
there's some things we need to talk about.

180
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,440
I love you.

181
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:25,120
I wish anything could happen
so I wouldn't have to come home today.

182
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,960
Hey, look, it's Dream Boy!

183
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,360
Who knows where tornadoes come from?

184
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:43,760
Well, when cold air mixes with hot air,
it can form a tornado,

185
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:47,440
as the hot and cold chase each other
around and around and around.

186
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:52,320
I dreamt of a story kind of like Sharkboy
and Lavagirl - Ice Girl and Dream Boy.

187
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,880
Her powers come from her crystal heart.

188
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,200
No more fairy tales.

189
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,560
Piranha Girl and Beluga Boy.

190
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,040
Plastic Boy and Metal Girl.

191
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,000
Barf Boy and Vomit Girl.

192
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,080
Does everyone hear me?
I'm a teacher, right?

193
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,560
Wrong. I'm an awakener.

194
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:15,120
Only I'm finding it more and more difficult
to keep my class... awake.

195
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,600
No recess again for you, Marissa -
too many allergies.

196
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,400
There are more boogers on your work
than there is work.

197
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,040
I'm just cold.

198
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:28,480
I'll be happy to change places with you.
It's a lot warmer back there in my spot.

199
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,840
But I... have to sit up front.

200
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:34,160
It's just that you're sitting
right under the vent.

201
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,920
- It's August and you're sneezing.
- You're gonna get me in trouble.

202
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,880
Max.

203
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,040
Are you... trying to make real friends?

204
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,240
Trying, like you told me to.

205
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,920
That's good.
Just not with my daughter, OK?

206
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,880
No! It wasn't like that. It's just...

207
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,080
Sit down, Max.

208
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,840
- Give me back my journal!
- Class has begun. Everyone in your seats.

209
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,960
- Linus took my journal!
- I did not!

210
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,720
Minus! I mean, Linus.

211
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:20,200
You get a minus for misconduct.
Give Max back his journal.

212
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,800
One more time, Linus, and we'll have to
change your name to Minus.

213
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,720
He ruined my dream journal!

214
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,920
I did not! Mr. Electric,
send him to the principal's office

215
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,360
and have him expelled!

216
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,560
You're in my class,
not the other way around!

217
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,360
I know everything
and you know nothing!

218
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,040
At the end of class,
both of you report to the principal's office!

219
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,640
With your parents!

220
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,640
Everybody down!

221
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,680
It's them!

222
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,600
I'm looking for Max.

223
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,720
She's hot!

224
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,600
Whoa!

225
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,160
We need your help, Max.
Come with us.

226
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,960
What do I have to do?

227
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,680
Go with us to Planet Drool.
We'll explain on the way.

228
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,440
We're going to Planet Drool?

229
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,520
It's my home planet.
Just outside our solar system.

230
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,760
You should know, Max - you made it up.

231
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,320
- I can't go with you.
- Why not?

232
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,640
Because you're not real.
Both of you are just a dream.

233
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,720
And when I open my eyes, you'll be gone.

234
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,280
We're still here, Max.

235
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:51,960
If you wanna stop the darkness
from destroying our worlds, come with us.

236
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,680
You better go with them.

237
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,400
OK... I'll go.

238
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:06,400
Everyone follow me
and we'll find shelter.

239
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,240
I can't believe I'm finally getting
to ditch this place and go to Planet Drool!

240
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,160
How are we getting there?

241
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,480
Put these on, everybody.

242
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:30,360
Blue goggles for the boys,
pink for the girls.

243
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,000
Do you have another pair of boy goggles?

244
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,080
Uh-uh.

245
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,520
So, how do you fly it?

246
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,960
- You don't know?
- Duh!

247
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,320
That's sort of been the whole problem!

248
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,640
You press go.

249
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:10,520
- Now, how do you fly it?
- It's got an autopilot.

250
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,160
You just thought of everything,
didn't you, Max?

251
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,280
Not exactly.

252
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:20,560
- How do we land it?
- That's the part I never thought of!

253
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,040
Jupiter... Saturn... Neptune...

254
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,280
You might wanna hold on to something.

255
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,920
Recognize your dream world, Max?

256
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,200
Not really.

257
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:55,680
I feel like I should,
but I just don't.

258
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,120
It's affecting him too.

259
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,400
I thought he would just remember.

260
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,680
- Remember what?
- Your dreams. This planet?

261
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,120
Us.

262
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,640
Your powers.

263
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:13,160
- I have powers?
- More than any of us.

264
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,480
Don't you know that?

265
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:19,920
Everything that is or was,
began with a dream.

266
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,360
And you dreamt us, Max.
Us and this whole place.

267
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,400
I did?

268
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:29,000
Every dream you ever had
landed right here on Planet Drool.

269
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,600
Why is it so dark?

270
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:35,240
The planet is dying.
It began yesterday.

271
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,880
What's the calculation, Sharkboy?

272
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,800
45 minutes till the darkness
destroys Planet Drool.

273
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:48,160
<i>We didn't go to Earth to save you, Max.
We need you to save Planet Drool.</i>

274
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,440
But how?

275
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,360
The Dream Lair
is on the other side of the planet.

276
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:58,040
That's where your dreams are going bad.
We have to go there and reverse it.

277
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,600
We have to travel through the Passage
of Time, catch the Train of Thought,

278
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,720
swim down the Stream of Consciousness

279
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:07,600
and skate across the Sea of Confusion -
now covered in ice.

280
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:11,080
Why'd you do that, Max?
Why'd you freeze the ocean?

281
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,360
I...

282
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,800
Ouch!

283
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,440
Max didn't mean to do it.
Did you, Max?

284
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:21,400
Max is a good boy, otherwise
you and I would be evil, and we're not evil.

285
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,800
I'm not evil, am I, Max?

286
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,680
I don't think so.

287
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,920
That's why we brought you here -
to put things back in order.

288
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,400
We just have to stay positive.
It's not the end of the world.

289
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,440
Not yet, it's not.

290
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,400
The darkness! Run!

291
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,080
This is like a bad dream!

292
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:47,000
Oh, yeah? Just wait till you meet Mr.
Electric! He's the worst bad dream yet!

293
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,120
Where is everyone?

294
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,640
- Mostly trapped on Mount Neverrest.
- By Mr. Electric.

295
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:07,400
But Planet Drool's a place for kids
to dream and have endless fun!

296
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,680
It's endless fun, all right.
Once you get on...

297
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,320
...you can't get off.

298
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,880
Kids aren't allowed to rest,
'cause if they rest, they sleep,

299
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,000
and if they sleep, they dream.

300
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:26,200
- And if they dream...
- It takes power away from Mr. Electric.

301
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,840
But we're gonna stop him
with our secret weapon.

302
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,880
Shouldn't we save those kids first?

303
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,600
Why can't I do that?

304
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,320
Lavagirl! Hooray!

305
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,480
Who knows where Mr. Electric is hiding?

306
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,960
Everyone?

307
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:33,640
They're not raising their hands.
You're all upside down.

308
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,480
Ah.

309
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:41,240
<i> Who is stopping
my unstoppable coasters?</i>

310
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,480
<i>- Back in your seats!
- Go! Run! Hide!</i>

311
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,120
<i>- Let's get outta here!
- Everyone back in your seats!</i>

312
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,040
Who's Mr. Electric?

313
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:56,000
He's supposed to provide light to the
planet, but all he brings now is darkness.

314
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,080
<i>Fun has begun!</i>

315
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,280
He's taking us up!

316
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:25,920
My home! At half its normal power.

317
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,600
He's taking us down.

318
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,440
Show time!

319
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,880
Keep playing! Never stop!

320
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:04,320
Games and toys and laughs...
hey-hey-hey... and fun!

321
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:12,640
Well, well, well.
If it isn't Sharkboy and Lavagirl.

322
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:18,960
What are you doing halting my endless-fun
coaster and infiltrating my lair?

323
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,080
We don't need permission from you.

324
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,640
Fiery!

325
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,000
I don't believe we've met.
I'm Mr. Electric!

326
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:30,560
Why are you bringing misery to our planet?
You're supposed to be running it.

327
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:36,160
<i>You're supposed to be running it.
I am running it - right into the ground.</i>

328
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,720
- Those are my orders.
- Who ordered that?

329
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:43,680
No school, no discipline, no rules.
And, most important, no dreams.

330
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,720
Dreams can destroy you, can't they?

331
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,840
- My instincts tell me that is so.
- Really?

332
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:54,120
- That's why we have to stop you.
- You and what army?

333
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,800
- Now?
- Now.

334
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:21,640
Ha-ha-ha-haa! Pee-pee-pee-pee...

335
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,720
Feel the burn!

336
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,320
Agh...

337
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,320
Not for real. Aaah!

338
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,320
Ha-ha!

339
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:32,840
Internal radar, shark-like reflexes...
You're amazing!

340
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,800
But is it enough to defeat Mr. Electric?

341
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:39,000
We have our secret weapon, remember?

342
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,960
Did you really believe you could stop me?

343
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,760
Oh... Ah...

344
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,840
I know we can't. But he can.

345
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,880
Take it away, Max.

346
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:58,360
- Show him what you're made of, Max.
- What am I supposed to do?

347
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,120
- I told you this would happen.
- I thought he would just remember.

348
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,480
Remember what?!

349
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,280
The dream. Remember the dream.

350
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,760
I don't remember half my dreams.

351
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,080
That's why I write them
in my dream journal.

352
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,800
<i>What half of your dreams
do you remember?</i>

353
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,760
This one I remember.

354
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,680
Where are you taking us?

355
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:30,080
Where all useless dreams go -
to the Dream Graveyard!

356
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,360
Whoa!

357
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,280
Ploop!

358
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,760
Cuckoo!

359
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:50,360
Well, at least we're on
the Passage of Time.

360
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,320
Maybe it'll take us to the Dream Lair.

361
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:56,800
It's going in the wrong
direction. The Dream Lair's that way.

362
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,840
What's in the Dream Lair?

363
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,840
It's where all the dreams
that fuel Planet Drool are stored.

364
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,800
But they're being destroyed.

365
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,400
- How?
- That's what we have to find out.

366
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,920
Soon even Sharkboy and I
will cease to exist.

367
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,400
Duck!

368
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,520
Max, where is your dream journal?

369
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,320
Great thinking, Sharkie!

370
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:25,520
We can read his dreams out loud
and turn everything back to the way it was.

371
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,400
I may even realize my true identity.

372
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,920
I threw it away.

373
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,640
My journal's back on Earth.

374
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,440
We really thought
you were the answer, Max.

375
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,720
Don't listen to him. He's just upset
because you didn't show up

376
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,840
and make him king of the ocean,
with a giant fish army to back him up.

377
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,400
Look who's talking!

378
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,800
You thought you'd find a great use
for your powers and heal the planet.

379
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:58,680
Max thought his dream world would be
a happy place. We've all been duped.

380
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,560
Ohh!

381
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,960
I think you broke my fin.

382
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,040
Sorry.

383
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:22,520
Hey, you! I see you hiding!
Come back here!

384
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,200
I was awakened!

385
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,000
I'm sorry.

386
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,480
Did all the children
from Mount Neverrest escape?

387
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:34,760
It was Sharkboy and Lavagirl.
But I took care of it - see?

388
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,640
Someone was with them?

389
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,040
Just another child afraid of
his own shadow. No threat to us.

390
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,640
I banished him to the Dream Graveyard.

391
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,120
Where old dreams lie?
He could find an ally!

392
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:51,560
I told you, every dream must be smashed,
every child captured!

393
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,920
You want him back,
we'll simply track him when he falls asleep.

394
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,360
Fool! He's the Daydreamer.

395
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:02,720
And the moment he realizes it
will be the moment of our doom!

396
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,360
Now what do you want me to do?

397
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,400
Bring me the boy
before he discovers his true powers

398
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,080
and tears my new kingdom apart!

399
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,840
Plugs, redirect the darkness.

400
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,720
And...

401
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,800
bring me the Plughounds!

402
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,880
We'll never find our way
out of this graveyard.

403
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,720
Darkness! Headed this way!

404
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,320
Sit down, Max.

405
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,760
- What for?
- Close your eyes and dream.

406
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,400
If Max can't remember his dreams,
maybe he can redream them.

407
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,480
He could dream us out of here.

408
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,640
Dream, Max.

409
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,200
Now, what do you see?

410
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:58,000
I see a... giant...
chocolate-chunk marshmallow cookie...

411
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,440
with lots of warm milk.

412
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,080
- Sorry. I'm starving.
- Here's some food.

413
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:10,520
- You're not gonna like that.
- I'm so hungry I could eat lava rocks.

414
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,840
What is that?!

415
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,320
Lava rocks.

416
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,000
Here, have some real food.
Fresh sushi.

417
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,640
- It'll knock you right out.
- That's not fresh.

418
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,960
I'm not even sure that's sushi anymore.

419
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:30,760
- It's just a few weeks old.
- I'll cook it for you.

420
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,800
Oops.

421
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,040
It's OK. I'm not that hungry anymore.

422
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,520
Let me just rest a moment.
Maybe I can sleep.

423
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,960
It's getting closer.

424
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,200
Get outta here!

425
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,600
Max, I know you've got a lot to figure out,

426
00:33:55,680 --> 00:34:00,320
but if you happen to dream about who I am
and how I fit into this world,

427
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,200
it would really be helpful for me...

428
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:06,120
No distractions. You steer him off course,
we could be lost in a sea of dreams.

429
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,480
- I'm sorry. I'm desperate.
- Focus on the problem at hand.

430
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,000
Max needs to dream us out of here,
so how about I put him to sleep?

431
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,600
- No, Sharkboy.
- Just one punch. He'll be out like a light.

432
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:24,520
I've seen this before.
It's on the tip of my... finger.

433
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,320
It's a hand!

434
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,960
<i>It is a hand.</i>

435
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,680
A hand?

436
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,280
Another hand.

437
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,520
Yep?

438
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,560
- It's Tobor!
- Who?

439
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:42,720
Tobor! I dreamt him up when I was a kid -

440
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,680
a robot that could help me
with my homework.

441
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:50,520
I tried to build him once. Everyone
kept telling me he would never work.

442
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:54,480
So here he is - a forgotten dream
in the Dream Graveyard.

443
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,160
Maybe he can help us.

444
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,600
He's supposed to be very smart.

445
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,760
Tobor, awake!

446
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,160
Yes?

447
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,800
He works!

448
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:08,880
- We can ask him anything now.
- Let me, let me!

449
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,160
Tell me something about me.
I'm clueless.

450
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:16,600
Actually, you are extremely bright.

451
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,600
Am I king of the ocean, or what?

452
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,800
No. Sorry.

453
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,160
How do I save Planet Drool?

454
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,280
The answer is in your dreams.

455
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,760
You mean if I put him to sleep,
he'll dream us out of this mess?

456
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,400
No. At least, not here.

457
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:41,680
Darkness is falling. Any dream of his
would become a nightmare -

458
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,880
and you don't want those
becoming a reality.

459
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,280
But if you go
to the Land of Milk and Cookies...

460
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,480
Of course!

461
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,000
...that's where the good dreams are.

462
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,520
Where the answers are.

463
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,040
It's perfect, Max.

464
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:59,360
The Land of Milk and Cookies
is a safe, sweet place.

465
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,640
You'll be able to dream easily there.

466
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,240
Can you take us?

467
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,760
I have no body. I can't move.

468
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:10,240
You can move your eyes and your mouth.

469
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,560
Why didn't you work back on Earth, Tobor?

470
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:18,840
Some dreams are so powerful they
become real - like Sharkboy and Lavagirl.

471
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:23,640
I, on the other hand,
am still only a dream.

472
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:24,640
Oh...

473
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:28,600
- What's wrong?
- Train of Thought... I'm losing it.

474
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,520
You were taking us to the Land
of Milk and Cookies, remember?

475
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:36,160
I mean I'm literally losing
the Train of Thought. It's down there.

476
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,800
That's the Train of Thought?
How do I keep it on track?

477
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:44,280
With your mind. The Train of Thought
gets easily distracted.

478
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:49,320
Stay focused, and it'll speed you directly
to the Land of Milk and Cookies.

479
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,280
The rest is up to you.

480
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,480
Sorry I forgot about you, Tobor.

481
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,440
Are you kidding? You just saved me.

482
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,960
I'm free!

483
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,240
Max, get down here!

484
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,000
- What's wrong?
- We can't control it.

485
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,280
All you have to do is keep it on track.

486
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:18,000
How can you keep it on track
if there is no track?

487
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,480
Looks like another dream gone bad!

488
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,520
What do we do?

489
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:29,160
Yell? Scream?

490
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,480
Jump. It'll be all right.

491
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:59,200
What does it mean
when your Train of Thought... wrecks?

492
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,200
Well... It can't be good, buddy.

493
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,120
How much time do we have, Sharkboy?

494
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,480
20 minutes.

495
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,040
Eww!

496
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:19,240
Stick to rotten fish, please!

497
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:23,040
Chocolate! I stepped in chocolate!

498
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,280
We're here.

499
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,560
The Land of Milk and Cookies!

500
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,800
Oh, yeah!

501
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:45,960
The milk is warm.
He'll be out in no time.

502
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,680
Lay down.
Here's a marshmallow pillow.

503
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,200
<i>How about dreaming us
into the Dream Lair?</i>

504
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,160
The ground is thumping too much.

505
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,080
My highly trained ears hear it too.

506
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,280
Boom, boom, boom.

507
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,560
- Let me hear it.
- I wouldn't.

508
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,160
Hothead.

509
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:15,080
When you dreamt up these giant cookies,
who did you expect to be able to eat them?

510
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,880
I really didn't think about it.

511
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,120
'Cause if you dream giant cookies,

512
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:23,360
<i>something has to be created
to consume giant cookies.</i>

513
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,480
Cookie giants!

514
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,120
Ohh...

515
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,000
Frosting.

516
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:11,080
Those giants almost look like my parents.

517
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,840
They seem happy together.
Is that your dream?

518
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:17,880
We had a dream we're family.
It hasn't been coming true lately.

519
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,560
Most dreams don't come true on their own.
You have to make them true.

520
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:25,480
It takes a lot of work. Not easy.

521
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,720
But not impossible either.

522
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,280
Stinking fresh air!

523
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,320
Blinding sunlight!

524
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:40,640
Oh, how I long for a sky
of fluorescent lights!

525
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,400
Ahh...

526
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,960
Better stand back.

527
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,280
All right, that was me.

528
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:06,360
- Still empty-handed, I see.
- If you're so powerful, you find him.

529
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:10,360
That's your job!
Do it, or I'll have you discharged!

530
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,000
Shh...

531
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,040
Someone is dreaming in here.

532
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:21,760
All right, Max, you've had
your cookies and milk. Now go to sleep.

533
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,080
I'll try.

534
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,920
Go to sleep!

535
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,960
Not like that. Sing him a lullaby.

536
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,240
Your turn.

537
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,640
It's working! Keep it up, Sharkboy.

538
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,600
Dream about me next, Max.

539
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,200
I need to know who I am.

540
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,840
Not just destruction or a simple flame.

541
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,440
Dream of me as something good.

542
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,240
He's having a nightmare!
Wake up, Max! Wake up!

543
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:44,000
<i>Stop that racket, Sharkboy -
you're giving him nightmares!</i>

544
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,880
Sorry, Max.

545
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,000
Argh!

546
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,240
Ow! Ohh...

547
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,080
What was that for?

548
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:55,400
Your nightmare was about me, wasn't it?

549
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,640
I don't remember.

550
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,840
But I did dream about one thing...

551
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,880
Plughounds!

552
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:08,000
This may come as a shock to you.

553
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,000
Feel the power!

554
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,680
It's empty!

555
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:21,960
Fudge.

556
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,080
I forgot to dream of gas.

557
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:27,640
Max!

558
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,480
My powers are weakening.

559
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:50,760
Watch the power lines - very dangerous.

560
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,760
Yaaarrhh!

561
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:20,640
Yaaarrhh!

562
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:23,680
Sharkboy, get me down from here!

563
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,200
Can't you see I'm busy?

564
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:47,440
Hot lava... Hot lava...

565
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,880
I don't got much fight left in me, Max.

566
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,800
Where's Lavagirl?

567
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,720
It's up to you now, Max.

568
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,240
Dream us out of here.

569
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:04,680
We believe in you, Max.

570
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:10,600
Shark boat with turbo boosters!
Shark boat with turbo boosters!

571
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,720
A banana split?!

572
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:19,280
Still hungry, Max?
How about a knuckle sandwich?

573
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,360
No, look!

574
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,680
It's a banana-split boat!

575
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,760
Then let's split!

576
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:29,040
Ow!

577
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:30,360
Huh?

578
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:53,240
Catch you later.

579
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:58,360
All dreamers must dream.

580
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:02,600
This is great, Max.
You're starting to daydream.

581
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:05,840
Keep that up, and they'll never get us.

582
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,960
Why not?

583
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:12,720
Learn to dream with your eyes open,
and you won't have to be asleep to dream.

584
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:16,840
You'll be able to make anything happen
at any time.

585
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:33,600
Sugar will give you nightmares.

586
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:36,800
- How much time do we have?
- Don't ask.

587
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:42,760
The Dream Lair's across the Ocean of Ice.
We'll have to travel there by foot.

588
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:45,640
What was it you saw in your dream, Max?

589
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:50,000
I saw an object shaped like...

590
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:53,280
Give me something to draw with.

591
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,360
The Crystal Heart!

592
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:10,880
That's the treasure of the Land of Ice!
In the Ice Castle.

593
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:14,600
It can freeze anything - even time.

594
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:17,920
I've always dreamt
of freezing a moment in time.

595
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,520
And the Ice Castle's
ruled by the Ice Princess.

596
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:23,320
I hear she's the most beautiful girl
on the planet.

597
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:24,640
Ouch!

598
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:28,400
She is not! She's cold and cruel
and cares for nobody but herself.

599
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,800
She's just saying that, Max.

600
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,920
- Have you met her?
- No. But I know we don't get along.

601
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,040
- How do you know that?
- I'm fire. She's ice.

602
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:40,080
We must be enemies.

603
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,360
We need that Crystal Heart.

604
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:44,920
But I need you both to get it.

605
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,760
I just hope this isn't a trap.

606
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:49,160
Whoa!

607
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:55,080
If we freeze time with the Crystal Heart,

608
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:58,760
we'll be able to make it to the Dream Lair
and save the planet.

609
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,720
That's the plan.

610
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,920
Behold the Ice Castle!

611
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,680
Home to the Princess of the Land of Ice.

612
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:11,880
- The Crystal Heart's inside the castle?
- So they say.

613
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,960
Let's go.

614
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:35,080
It's no use! I'll melt the bridge.

615
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:37,400
This place inflames me.

616
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:39,800
Can you cool down enough to get across?

617
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:41,880
I'd have to be asleep to do that.

618
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:44,920
Can you try sleepwalking?

619
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:54,840
My dream is to live on Earth -
but someplace warm -

620
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,000
and that Earth will accept me,

621
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:00,640
even... if I... destroy...

622
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:03,560
everything I... touch!

623
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:06,880
No, Lavagirl! Don't sneeze!

624
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:16,560
Aaa-tchoo!

625
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,560
Aarghh...

626
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:24,360
Look.

627
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:28,320
She's sleeping.

628
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:49,080
- They've found us again! Lavagirl!
- Shh!

629
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:51,720
If you wake her up, she'll reheat.

630
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:54,440
She can make it.

631
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:05,000
Lavagirl, they're behind you!

632
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,400
- Let's go. Hurry!
- Argh!

633
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,040
It's a trap!

634
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:37,480
You can almost feel
the electricity in the air, can't you?

635
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:41,960
This is all wrong.
Someone else's dreams are in here.

636
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:44,080
Lights out!

637
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:59,360
Welcome to the Dream Lair!

638
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:02,200
I am the ruler of Planet Drool.

639
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:05,560
No, you're not! Max is!

640
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:09,320
Max may have dreamed it originally...

641
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:15,400
but I am much... cooler.

642
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:18,840
I... am Minus.

643
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,280
How'd you get so powerful?

644
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:24,400
I do a lot of reading.

645
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,120
My book of dreams!

646
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:30,280
That's why everything's so messed up -
he's changing it!

647
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:32,600
Electric eels.

648
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:39,160
Shocking, isn't it, Sharkboy?

649
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:45,800
Reminds me of the time that electrical
storm blew apart your father's laboratory.

650
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:49,400
- Where is my father?
- Hm.

651
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:51,360
Let's see.

652
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:57,000
Check the bottom of the ocean.

653
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:02,120
And Lavagirl...

654
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:05,080
Once I figure out
how to freeze this planet's core,

655
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:07,600
all of your powers will disappear.

656
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:10,440
Powers? What powers?

657
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:16,280
And last but least, Max.

658
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:19,400
You thought you could escape fear
by running away to dreamland.

659
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:24,200
But fear exists
in the one place you can never escape!

660
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:27,160
Your mind!

661
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,760
I will show you the true meaning of fear.

662
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:33,760
When darkness falls,
the rest of your dreams will be destroyed

663
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:36,400
and I will rule Planet Drool.

664
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:39,960
Blah-blah-blah, threat-threat-threat...

665
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:44,360
You must all leave now.
I have some dreaming to do.

666
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,240
Whoa!

667
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,680
If I could just get my dream journal,

668
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:00,840
I could turn everything
back to the way it was.

669
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:03,800
My fire's dimming.

670
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,560
I can't melt the bars.

671
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:10,440
My strength is failing me as well.

672
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:13,960
How much time do we have, Sharkboy?

673
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:18,280
Who cares?
We're never getting out of here.

674
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,360
La La's.

675
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:30,440
They like you.

676
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:33,720
- I don't feel distracted right now.
- I do!

677
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:35,880
This song is driving me crazy!

678
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:38,880
Don't worry about him.
He's a cold fish.

679
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,920
I'm serious!

680
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:44,560
They're singing at a frequency...

681
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:47,000
my highly trained ears find...

682
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:48,680
disturbing!

683
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:51,000
Sing louder. Sing higher.

684
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:57,400
You don't wanna be too close to him
when he explodes.

685
00:53:58,920 --> 00:53:59,960
Aaargghh!

686
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:01,600
Shark frenzy!

687
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:16,040
Nice job channeling your anger, Sharkie.

688
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:19,080
Huh.

689
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:49,640
First things first.
Transportation out of here.

690
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:54,400
My dreams.

691
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:00,880
Lavagirl, you have a lava bike!

692
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,400
I do?

693
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,800
I do!

694
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:09,120
This is so exciting!

695
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:10,720
Cool it, Lavagirl.

696
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:13,760
Everything we need
is right here in this book.

697
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:21,720
Sharkboy... your father really is
at the bottom of the ocean.

698
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:31,080
He's in a submarine.

699
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:33,600
Looking for you!

700
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:39,440
He's over the hydrothermal vents,
Mid-Atlantic Ridge,

701
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:43,760
42 degrees west by 14 north.
Depth: 1800 meters.

702
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,840
Near a snake pit!

703
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:47,600
I need to get back to Earth.

704
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:51,240
- What's it say about me?
- I'm not sure what this is.

705
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:54,280
I can figure it out. Maybe there's
a section on my true identity.

706
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:56,280
Lavagirl, no!

707
00:55:57,240 --> 00:56:00,520
Oh, no. What have I done?

708
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,760
That's terrific, LG!

709
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:09,560
It's OK, Lavagirl.
It was an accident.

710
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:13,480
Why did you make me out of lava?!
Why, Max?

711
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:19,080
Just let her cool down.
She's just blowing off steam.

712
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,800
I know I can be good.

713
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,520
I can feel it.

714
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:32,680
But everything I touch, I destroy.

715
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:39,480
Why did you make me like that?
I have more potential.

716
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:41,600
I'm sure you do.

717
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:46,960
And why'd you make us a team?
We're nothing alike.

718
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:50,880
When I'm near water, I fizzle out.
When he's near heat, he shrivels.

719
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:52,680
We're not compatible.

720
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:57,120
Your... hair's on fire.

721
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,560
Yeah, it does that.

722
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:04,560
Thanks, Sharkie.

723
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,400
Maybe I really am evil.

724
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:14,520
So far everything else you've dreamed
has been correct.

725
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:17,160
Maybe I just need to learn to accept it.

726
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:22,560
That's it! Everything I've dreamt so far
has been correct.

727
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:24,280
The Crystal Heart!

728
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:29,720
Yeah, we were captured, but that's
'cause Minus doesn't want me to get it.

729
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:35,840
We have to get back to the Ice Castle.

730
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:38,400
10 minutes left. We'll never make it!

731
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:41,080
- We can do it!
- How?

732
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:45,720
You're Sharkboy and Lavagirl.
You can do anything.

733
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:54,800
Wake up!

734
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:57,160
What?

735
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:01,000
He escaped.
And he's getting the Crystal Heart.

736
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:03,120
Shut it down. Shut it all down now!

737
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:07,480
I did. It's on a grid system.
It takes time for the darkness to travel.

738
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:10,040
- How soon?
- Not soon enough.

739
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:12,440
- Then destroy him.
- How?

740
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:17,960
By smashing his most precious dream:
Sharkboy and Lavagirl.

741
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:39,640
Is that what you saw, Max?

742
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:40,840
Yes.

743
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:44,160
You'll have to climb the ice pillar and get it.

744
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:47,880
It's as delicate as a snowflake,
so don't drop it.

745
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:51,200
And don't touch it with your hands either -
you'll freeze.

746
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,200
Use your claws.

747
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:01,520
Aaarrhh...

748
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:09,240
Lava, can you...?

749
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:11,760
Never mind.

750
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:15,480
Chew on some ice. It'll keep you cool.

751
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:21,760
Hm.

752
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,400
Great job, Max.

753
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:55,440
I got it!

754
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:04,320
She's frozen solid!

755
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:24,400
Kneel before the Ice Princess.

756
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:36,800
You tried to steal the Crystal Heart.
Why?

757
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:44,640
We believe it can freeze time.
Long enough for us to defeat Minus.

758
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:49,240
My Crystal Heart cannot help you.
Only I have the power to use it.

759
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:52,240
- Then come with us.
- She can never leave this castle.

760
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:57,600
The crystal is the only thing
that protects our kingdom.

761
01:00:57,640 --> 01:01:00,200
Please, Princess.
We're running out of time.

762
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:02,520
Perhaps I could give it to you.

763
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:06,200
- Not without my blessing.
- Father, you're smothering me again.

764
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:09,640
But are you worthy to wield it?

765
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:10,960
Yes.

766
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:13,560
The crystal you stole was a decoy.

767
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:16,960
The true Crystal Heart
is somewhere in this room.

768
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:21,040
Choose the correct one,
and you may carry it before you.

769
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:22,760
Pick that one.

770
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:26,720
It's around your neck.

771
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:32,480
- How'd you know?
- I saw it in my dream.

772
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:38,560
Usually, if you snooze, you lose.
With Max, you snooze, you win.

773
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:46,680
But be warned, Max,
if anything happens to my Crystal Heart,

774
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:50,080
my entire kingdom will be destroyed.

775
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:54,120
Do you, Max, take this Crystal Heart
to have and to hold,

776
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:57,480
in sickness and in health,
till death do you part?

777
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:58,560
I do.

778
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:00,920
- Do you trust him with your heart?
- I do.

779
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,280
Do you mean what you say?

780
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,080
Yes.

781
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:06,960
I mean, I do.

782
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:10,840
The crystal will now work -
but my daughter must stay here.

783
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:12,880
Off with you, then!

784
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:14,360
Good luck.

785
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:24,280
We're almost at the Dream Lair!

786
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:27,480
If we're gonna do this, we gotta do it now!

787
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:31,200
- How much time?
- We're out of time!

788
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:33,160
10 seconds!

789
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:41,160
What?

790
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:42,800
I can't hear you.

791
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:44,960
- Five seconds.
- Here it goes.

792
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,800
Three, two, one...

793
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:52,280
We're out of time.

794
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:54,600
- What happened?
- It didn't work.

795
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:56,760
How could it not work?

796
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:02,240
I was trying to tell you! Whoa...

797
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Only the Ice Princess can use it.

798
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:08,120
It's not her fault
her father won't let her leave her castle.

799
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:09,800
Boo-hoo.

800
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:11,960
No underwater readings.

801
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:15,160
No anything!

802
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:24,920
I'll rip your sockets to shreds!

803
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,680
Calm down, Sharkboy.
Mr. Electric's baiting you.

804
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:30,920
I can't... fight...

805
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,400
my instincts!

806
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:35,160
No, Sharkboy!

807
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:40,120
Hey!

808
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:43,120
Watts... up?

809
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:45,480
You know - watts.

810
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:48,480
As in a measure of electrical power.

811
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:50,920
The 60-watt bulb?

812
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:54,400
Watts up?

813
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:55,880
What?

814
01:03:55,960 --> 01:04:00,040
Electric eels. That's what's up.

815
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:02,440
Swim away, Sharkboy! Swim away!

816
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:24,280
Can he survive down there?

817
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:27,440
He can hold his breath, but not forever.

818
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:31,400
- He'll drown if I don't go get him.
- I can't let you go.

819
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:33,440
You'll die too.

820
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:38,120
He's my best friend.

821
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:01,560
Come on, Sharkboy.

822
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:10,400
Come on, Sharkboy!

823
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:19,880
Sharkboy! Wake up, Sharkboy!

824
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:25,920
Lavagirl!

825
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:29,640
Lavagirl! Lavagirl, please!

826
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:32,280
Lavagirl...

827
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:40,520
What am I gonna do now?

828
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:44,840
What do you think you should do?

829
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:49,120
Dream a better dream.

830
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:51,680
Interesting. Explain.

831
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:58,120
I wanted all my dreams to come true,
but I only dreamt for myself.

832
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:01,120
I wanted to escape my real world,

833
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:05,160
when the world needed my help
to make it a better place.

834
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:09,080
Selfish dreams shouldn't come true.

835
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:12,080
You're becoming
a very good dreamer, Max.

836
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:14,520
A very good dreamer indeed.

837
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:21,160
What do you do
when your dreams have been destroyed?

838
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:24,000
Dream a better dream.

839
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:26,880
An unselfish dream.

840
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:37,160
She knew this would happen
if she saved you.

841
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:39,240
But I couldn't stop her.

842
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,320
Look!

843
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:48,640
Lava.

844
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:51,920
We have to get her to that volcano.

845
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,600
I'll go. I'm stronger and faster.

846
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:56,600
You'll burn up.

847
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:03,800
- Sure this will save her?
- It'll do more than save her.

848
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:13,280
I know who you are, Lavagirl.

849
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:17,720
<i>You are not fire, or a simple flame. </i>

850
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:20,960
<i>You are greater than that. </i>

851
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:25,160
<i>Something more important,
and so necessary. </i>

852
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:28,680
It is why you must live.

853
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:34,360
You are not destruction.

854
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:44,920
You are not evil.

855
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:56,040
Stand back.

856
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:01,080
You are... light.

857
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:17,760
Who turned on the lights?! Oh!

858
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:21,120
Power, everywhere!

859
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:38,600
Whoa! How'd you get here so fast?

860
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:41,880
Hold off Mr. Electric
while I deal with Minus.

861
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:44,280
I'll need my fish army.

862
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:46,400
I'll unfreeze the ocean.

863
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:50,120
Good luck.

864
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:55,440
I've become what you feared most...

865
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:57,320
Minus.

866
01:08:58,280 --> 01:09:00,000
How did you get in here?

867
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:05,760
I'm the Daydreamer,
able to dream with my eyes open.

868
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:09,560
Hate to burst your bubble, Dream Boy,
but I read your book.

869
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:13,440
There's not one dream you've got
that I haven't already seen.

870
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:18,320
So what do you say?
Let's blow the roof off this place.

871
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:24,960
May the best dream win!

872
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:49,280
Wait!

873
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:56,280
Brainstorm!

874
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:10,720
Eugh!

875
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:13,800
Brain... freeze!

876
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,720
Brain...

877
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:21,080
fart!

878
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:25,760
Oh...

879
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:43,520
Get ready for the ultimate power outage.

880
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:50,440
And who are you to believe
that you can defeat me now?

881
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:52,520
No one special.

882
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:56,280
Just... king of the ocean.

883
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:05,240
Ooh...

884
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:11,440
Shark frenzy.

885
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:14,760
Aaarhh... Aaarhh... Aaarhh...

886
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:16,160
A- ha!

887
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:19,640
You're afraid of me, aren't you?

888
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:25,320
I used to be.

889
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:31,040
<i>Someone smashed your dreams once -</i>

890
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:34,240
now all you can do
is smash everyone else's.

891
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:45,960
We can create a better dream than this.
A better world.

892
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Don't you see?

893
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:55,680
What do you say...

894
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:58,640
Linus?

895
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:11,840
Hurry!

896
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:14,440
No!

897
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:21,240
Don't let me fall!

898
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:25,480
Wouldn't dream of it.

899
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:37,920
Don't smash people's dreams, Linus,
because you'll smash your own as well.

900
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:40,680
And you too will stop believing.

901
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:46,920
Max!

902
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:48,760
I am light.

903
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:49,880
Thank you.

904
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:53,920
You were always that.
It had nothing to do with me.

905
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:57,080
But now I know. So thank you.

906
01:12:57,120 --> 01:13:01,440
OK, so she's a light. Big deal.

907
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:05,600
<i>The real news is... what I am.</i>

908
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:07,560
Annoying?

909
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:10,720
King of the ocean.

910
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:12,800
Thanks for saving me.

911
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:18,600
Ouch.

912
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:21,400
Everything will return
to being the way it was.

913
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:24,520
You will be able to travel to Earth
and back again as you wish.

914
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:27,880
You can search for your father.
You can rule Earth's lava world.

915
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:32,680
And what am I to do,
now that you're all buddy-buddy?

916
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:38,360
Mr. Electric can go back
to being the good electrician of the planet.

917
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:39,800
Oh, really?

918
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:42,120
Plugging in power cords?

919
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:45,320
Keeping this loud, obnoxious world
a happy place?

920
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:46,840
You're dreaming!

921
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:49,720
I dreamt you up,
and I can undream you.

922
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:55,360
You think you can just snap your eyes
open and make me vanish? Not so easy.

923
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:58,200
I am the danger of dreaming.

924
01:13:58,280 --> 01:14:01,000
For every person
who dreams up the electric light bulb,

925
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:04,360
there's the one
who dreams up the atom bomb.

926
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:06,760
This is one dream
you won't be waking up from.

927
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:11,320
I'm gonna put an end
to this ridiculous tangent at its source!

928
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:15,080
Where did he go?

929
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:17,880
He's headed to Earth.

930
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:21,560
He's going to try and destroy you
in your sleep.

931
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:24,400
In my sleep?

932
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:30,920
You mean I'm asleep?
All this time I've been asleep?

933
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:33,800
No. You're dreaming, Max.

934
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:35,840
With your eyes open.

935
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:37,680
Make the dream real.

936
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:42,280
You can live out your dreams on Earth.
Just like you made us real.

937
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:43,840
Make it real.

938
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:46,720
Blink your eyes three times.

939
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:48,680
One...

940
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:51,080
Wait. What happens when...?

941
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:52,320
Two...

942
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:56,520
Will I ever see you again?

943
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:58,080
Three.

944
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:09,800
Everyone follow me, I said!
We've got to find shelter!

945
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:14,720
Max, get up!
There's a tornado heading our way!

946
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:21,960
It's not a tornado.
It's much worse than that.

947
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,040
Linus, wake up!

948
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:25,920
Look!

949
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:35,880
Charge!

950
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:41,040
It's Mr. Electric from Planet Drool!
The one from my dreams!

951
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:45,280
You mean... this is real?
Your dream is real?

952
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:48,800
Some dreams are so powerful
they become real.

953
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:50,600
I don't believe it.

954
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:53,280
- It's right there in front of you!
- I can see that!

955
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:59,560
What I can't believe is you dreamt me
as a big round bad guy! I'm not bad!

956
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:03,360
Sorry. Kinda took on a life of its own.

957
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:12,640
- Max is in Building C.
- No, he's not. He's in Building W.

958
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:15,200
That was the other school!

959
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:28,840
Aaarhh!

960
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:30,280
Help!

961
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:35,320
Find Max! Tell him I love him!

962
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:39,200
- Don't leave me!
- I thought you wanted me to leave.

963
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:43,080
No, I don't. You're my best friend.

964
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:45,320
I love you.

965
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:47,880
I love you too.

966
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:50,400
Aaargh!

967
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:54,680
Come back!

968
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:58,440
Please, come back.

969
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:10,200
I'm not going anywhere.

970
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:13,200
Neither am I.

971
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:15,200
Aah... Aargh!

972
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:18,920
Uh-oh.

973
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:21,320
Aaargghh!

974
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:36,640
OK, class. I'm just a teacher, and
I'm here to inspire the answers from you.

975
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:39,560
And I think that's some
pretty good inspiration outside.

976
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:44,680
So this is now a pop quiz.
We need to defeat that guy. Any ideas?

977
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:49,000
Wow, Linus. You get a plus
for being the first hand in the air.

978
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:51,160
I can take him.

979
01:17:51,240 --> 01:17:52,840
Linus, watch out!

980
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:57,440
- Poop.
- Aaargh!

981
01:17:57,480 --> 01:17:59,160
Ohh...

982
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:05,000
Nice try.

983
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:07,720
Sorry, Max. Your journal.

984
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:10,280
It's OK. It was an accident.

985
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:12,760
Plenty more dreams
where those came from.

986
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:17,760
OK, kids, who's next?
Remember, there are no dumb ideas.

987
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:21,240
- Maybe we can freeze his circuits.
- That's the dumbest idea I ever heard.

988
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:24,640
We're in the middle of Texas in August!
Next idea? Anyone but Linus.

989
01:18:24,680 --> 01:18:28,000
Wait - that's a great idea!
Thanks, Linus.

990
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:30,240
Come here, Marissa.

991
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:36,760
Is this yours?

992
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:38,640
How'd you find it?

993
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:40,840
So you've seen this?

994
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:45,280
Yes, but... only in a dream.

995
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:48,840
- It can freeze anything.
- Even time.

996
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:52,120
What are you doing?
You're not sending my daughter out there.

997
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:53,480
Let her out.

998
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:57,040
Electrical storm headed your way!

999
01:18:57,640 --> 01:19:00,680
- Do you know what to do?
- I believe so.

1000
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:03,320
Stand back.

1001
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:12,680
Oh, who do we have here?

1002
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:19,000
Get ready for the mega-hurts!

1003
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:23,320
Get it? Hertz?

1004
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:26,120
As in the unit of electrical frequency?

1005
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:32,840
You're just not paying attention in class,
are you?

1006
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:34,120
Ooh!

1007
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:44,520
Whoa! Awesome!

1008
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:46,720
He's unplugged.

1009
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:48,920
Yeah!

1010
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:06,840
- You made me a great teacher today.
- How did I do that?

1011
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:10,560
A great teacher learns as much
from his students as they do from him.

1012
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:14,400
You have... awakened me.

1013
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:16,960
Thank you, Max.

1014
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:45,240
Max.

1015
01:20:45,320 --> 01:20:47,520
Your report, please.

1016
01:20:56,280 --> 01:20:59,160
The following story is true.

1017
01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:02,040
It might have started as a dream,

1018
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:06,440
but, as we saw yesterday,
when we make our dreams a reality...

1019
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:10,040
reality becomes a dream.

1020
01:21:10,840 --> 01:21:13,760
<i>Sharkboy lives his dream
as king of the ocean,</i>

1021
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:16,680
<i>where he cares for all its creatures. </i>

1022
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:20,840
<i>He searches for his father's submarine
where there is no light -</i>

1023
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:26,280
<i>except in one place, where light shines
almost as bright as the sun. </i>

1024
01:21:26,360 --> 01:21:28,800
<i>It's where Lavagirl lives her dream,</i>

1025
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:33,200
<i>as queen of Earth's volcanoes
that boil at the bottom of the sea,</i>

1026
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:35,880
<i>a force of life for all living things. </i>

1027
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:40,000
<i>Sharkboy and Lavagirl
don't visit me anymore. </i>

1028
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:46,440
<i>But I can visit them - in my dreams. </i>

1029
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:50,040
<i>So dream a better dream... </i>

1030
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:53,760
<i>then work to make it real. </i>

1031
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:56,640
Yes?
