<i>- Get those people out of the way!
- Go! Go! Go!</i>

2
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:33,291
<i>The President has been shot!</i>

3
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:36,665
<i>There were at least 3 gunshots.
There appear to be at least...</i>

4
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:39,831
<i>Get those people out of
the fucking way. Let's go!</i>

5
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:41,271
I'm all right.

6
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:43,502
To the van. Let's go! Let's go!

7
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,841
Was anyone else hit?

8
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:49,907
Go! Go! Go! Go!

00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:52,451
- Call my wife. Tell her I'm okay.
- He got through security.

10
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:54,248
Repeat, he got through security.

11
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,151
- Tell her I'm okay.
- We will, Mr. President.

12
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:57,211
- God damn it!
- We'll call her.

<i>MSNBC has confirmed
that a few minutes ago,</i>

14
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:08,262
<i>US war planes struck
military bases in Venezuela</i>

15
00:01:08,334 --> 00:01:13,169
<i>in retaliation for the assassination attempt
on President Lyman 3 weeks ago.</i>

16
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:15,764
<i>Our Emily Boyd is on the ground in Caracas.</i>

17
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:17,867
<i>Emily, what are you hearing now?</i>

18
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:21,038
<i>Jim, as you can imagine, the situation
on the ground in Caracas</i>

19
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:23,878
<i>can be described as a state of chaos.</i>

20
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:27,416
<i>Apparently, President Lyman
responded to a CIA report</i>

21
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:30,513
<i>said to have overwhelmingly
and conclusively asserted</i>

22
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,718
<i>Venezuela's involvement
in the assassination attempt.</i>

23
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:34,851
<i>President Lopez's government...</i>

4 bottles of milk on the wall
4 bottles of milk

25
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:44,734
You take one down, you pass it
around 3 bottles of milk on the wall

26
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:47,202
3 bottles of milk on the wall

27
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:48,672
Oh, my God, this song.

28
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:52,074
Is this what we got in
trouble for in Abu Ghraib?

29
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:58,180
I don't know why anybody actually signed
up to be a room mother.

30
00:01:58,251 --> 00:01:59,377
Yeah.

31
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:04,455
Hey, Timmy!

32
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:09,025
- What are you doing?
- Sorry, Mom.

33
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:15,466
Can you just, like, sing along
with everybody else?

34
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:17,594
I don't have a good voice.

35
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:21,437
Well, me, neither. Come on, sing along.

36
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:22,970
Come on.

37
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,272
- Mrs. Robinson?
- Yeah, what is it, dear?

38
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:29,907
Nicky Ludlow keeps pulling on my hair,
and he won't stop.

39
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,917
Well, just switch seats.

40
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,885
But the bus is full.

41
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:38,515
You know what, just stay right here. Okay?
I'll deal with it.

42
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:40,286
You're a tattletale!

43
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,988
- I am not!
- You just told on Nicky.

44
00:02:43,062 --> 00:02:45,223
That's because he won't stop.

45
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:48,267
- You're a tattletale.
- Timmy, that's enough. Stop it.

46
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,700
- That's enough.
- But you're not supposed to tattle.

47
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:54,729
Well, you're not supposed
to have to put up with bullies, either.

48
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:57,805
Come on.

49
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,369
Capital Sun Times.

50
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:01,970
It's gonna be the Redskins.

51
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:04,710
You know what you call 53 people
watching the Super Bowl?

52
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:06,445
- No, sir.
- The Washington Redskins.

53
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:07,781
That's what you call them.

54
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,344
Larry, you should be supporting
the home team.

55
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:10,912
I would support the North Koreans

56
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,480
if they were playing
the Washington Redskins.

57
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:16,359
All right, Judy, give it 4 hours
as top story on the Net, I guess.

58
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:18,158
- Thank you, B.B.
- That's it, boss. I think.

59
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:21,598
Okay. Thanks, everybody.
Let's make it a good one.

60
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:25,195
Let me ask you a question.
How many Olympians do we have in town?

61
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:26,465
Oh, quite a few.

62
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,570
Rache, stick around a minute, would you?

63
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:34,275
You know there's that track star, right?
From Georgetown?

64
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:36,747
- Yeah.
- Okay, get on him, too, all right?

65
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:38,714
- Get the door for me, would you, Kelly?
- No problem.

66
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:40,013
Thanks.

67
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:46,756
Okay, Rache.

68
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:49,727
We're gonna fast track the story. Your story.

69
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:51,787
Really? When?

70
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:53,855
The New York Times has gotten hold
of some of the information,

71
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:54,957
so we're going to beat them to the punch.

72
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:57,366
Yeah.
Want to get it on the doorsteps tomorrow.

73
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:59,302
I mean, it's a killer story.

74
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:02,273
No, I know. It's Watergate. It's Iran- Contra.

75
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:03,673
It mean, it's a "holy shit" piece, Bonnie.

76
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,301
- It's gonna take them down.
- Rachel.

77
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:10,315
- Sorry. Gotta rein it in. I'm kind of excited.
- Okay, we gotta remain objective.

78
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:13,841
Well, fine. We'll objectively bring down
the White House.

79
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,218
What else do you need to do
to finish the story?

80
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:20,385
I gotta call the White House.
Of course, go to Van Doren herself.

81
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:23,485
Out of curiosity,
why haven't you spoken to her yet?

82
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:25,292
Avril, I already told you,

83
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:28,766
if we went to her too early,
we give the CIA time to shut the story down.

84
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:30,894
We go now, there's nothing they can do.

85
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,905
Okay. Look, legally the story is solid.

86
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:36,300
Everything is factually in line.
There's no libel.

87
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:39,311
Well, that's all that's important, right?

88
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:45,242
I wish you would let me know
who your source is on this.

89
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:48,713
A title, a job description.

90
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:54,156
Okay, look, we have 2 confirming sources.

91
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:56,787
Rachel told me who they are,
and I'm comfortable with them.

92
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:59,889
We have Van Doren's letter
to the CIA director

93
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,558
that the Feds gave to Rachel.

94
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,727
- That's enough to go to press.
- It's your flip of the coin.

95
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:06,237
I'm just saying
that what you guys are okay with,

96
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,036
the government may not be.
The laws are murky.

97
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,000
I'm sorry, what?

98
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:12,635
It's illegal for a government official

99
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:15,306
to reveal the identity
of an undercover CIA agent.

100
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:16,746
Okay. Well, I'm not a government official.

101
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,477
I don't understand why you're bringing...
You know what?

102
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:20,314
We've already discussed this.
Bonnie's signed off on it.

103
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:21,751
As long as we all know
what we're dealing with.

104
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,152
All right, we know.

105
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:25,656
Okay, do you know how to find her?
Van Doren?

106
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:27,625
Yeah.
I'll go to her as soon as I get out of here.

107
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:30,595
Our kids go to school together,
if you can believe that.

108
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,631
- No shit?
- Yeah.

109
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:34,758
Okay, you feel comfortable
going to her for comment?

110
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,202
Absolutely.

111
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:38,599
Yeah! That's it! Come on! Pass it in!

112
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:41,904
- Stay open, Ali!
- Angela, pass it to me.

113
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:44,638
I got it! I got it!

114
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:47,809
Come on now! Push up! Push up!

115
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:50,849
Yes, Ali! Good job! Good job!

116
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:53,808
Kick it, honey! Kick it hard!

117
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:55,444
Good pass!

118
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,654
Spread out, girls! Spread out!

119
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:04,521
Get in there! Come on!

120
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:06,864
- Hey.
- Hello.

121
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:13,733
Oh, no. Defense! Come on, defense! Allison.

122
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:16,468
- She's doing great out there.
- Yeah.

123
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:21,438
- Every one of them chases the ball.
- Well, nobody likes defense.

124
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:23,141
Come on, Ali! Come on.

125
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:26,310
- She is in Mr. Cody's class. Right?
- Yeah.

126
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,946
- Yeah, my son, too.
- I see.

127
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:32,554
- Come on, Allison.
- There you go, there you go, honey!

128
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,593
Could we talk in private?

129
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,322
I'm with the Sun Times,
I need a few minutes.

130
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,297
It's kind of important.

131
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:40,764
Yeah. Sure.

132
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:49,465
I'm just concerned
she might have seen me slip away.

133
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:52,511
- I won't keep you long.
- Okay. So, what's up?

134
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:56,612
Erica, I'm writing a story.
I work for the national desk.

135
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:58,115
- Okay?
- Neat.

136
00:06:58,184 --> 00:07:01,813
And it's gonna run tomorrow,
and it's gonna say, among other things,

137
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:04,083
that you are a CIA operative,

138
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:08,459
and that you went on a mission,
a fact-finding mission to Venezuela.

139
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:10,928
What? This is...

140
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:12,692
Hear me out, okay?

141
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:15,127
You went there on a fact- finding mission

142
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:16,930
to determine if its government
was responsible

143
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:19,369
for the assassination attempt
on President Lyman.

144
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,169
You determined it was not,
and you informed your bosses of this.

145
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:25,438
This is the stupidest B.S. I have ever heard.

146
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:27,342
Wait, wait. What? Can you...

147
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:29,005
How do I know
that you're from the Sun Times?

148
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:32,380
The White House ignored your findings
and launched an attack anyway,

149
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,250
still claiming retribution
for the assassination attempt.

150
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:37,380
I've been on the national desk for 5 years.

151
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:40,851
I have a column every Tuesday
on the editorial page.

152
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,421
My son goes to school here, too.

153
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:45,623
Yeah, I know. You said that.

154
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:50,567
You people.

155
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,838
You people! My God! You fucking people!

156
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:57,706
You know, this isn't about me.
Once again, it's about my husband.

157
00:07:57,777 --> 00:07:59,108
My source is impeccable.

158
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:01,806
Your source is 110% fucking peccable.

159
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:05,647
I'm a CIA operative?

160
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:10,485
I can't even use the navigation system
in my Prius. This is... This is absurd!

161
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:14,586
Your paper... Your paper has been
trying to fuck my husband

162
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,560
ever since he spoke out
against this administration.

163
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:18,028
- We have your memo.
- What memo?

164
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:21,066
- We have your findings.
- You know. My attorney is Harry Timmers.

165
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:22,828
- Do you know him?
- Sure.

166
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:25,097
He's gonna take a lead pipe to you,
and he's gonna shove it up your ass.

167
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,605
Well, I certainly don't want that.

168
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:31,268
What are you doing? What are you doing?
Our kids go to school together, Robin.

169
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,335
- Rachel Armstrong.
- Right. Whatever.

170
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:34,538
Are you denying you're CIA?

171
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:39,278
You know what? You stay away from us.
Okay? I mean it.

172
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:46,917
Just say that the White House
doesn't comment on security issues.

173
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:48,790
Is that what you're saying?

174
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,488
Come on, David.
Give me something I can spell.

175
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:52,087
Off the record, this is bullshit.

176
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:53,631
You're gonna set off a shit storm
for nothing,

177
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,724
for a lousy column inch of space.

178
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:58,463
- Rachel, it's your son on line 5
- You're gonna have egg on your face.

179
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,837
I gotta go, David.
I got my son on the other line.

180
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,437
Hey, kiddo.

181
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,774
Hi, Mom. Did you get my paper?

182
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:10,813
Yeah, I'm just getting it now.
Can I read it and call you back?

183
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,408
Okay, but I gotta go to bed soon.

184
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:16,011
Okay.
Well, you can wait up for me to call you.

185
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:18,522
But Dad said I had to go to bed.

186
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:21,118
Well, we'll do it in the morning. I promise.

187
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:22,251
Okay.

188
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:25,263
It's just, I have a real big story, honey.

189
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:27,122
It's fine, Mom.

190
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:30,366
Okay, I love you. Bye- bye.

191
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:32,529
- Sorry.
- Hey, what's that?

192
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:36,166
My son had to do a paper on India.
I was just looking over his outline.

193
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,734
I bet you he could give me 10 inches
on India's nuclear buildup with Pakistan.

194
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:41,609
- Oh, yeah.
- How'd you do with David?

195
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:44,775
"White House doesn't comment
on security issues. " Blah-blah.

196
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:48,308
Yeah, well, I know you'll give it
more eloquent phrasing than "blah-blah. "

197
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:50,252
- Sure.
- Feels good, huh?

198
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:51,950
It's worth every dime I don't make.

199
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:55,687
Look, I want you to start
on a major profile of Van Doren,

200
00:09:55,761 --> 00:10:00,130
from Yale to CIA, to the marriage to
the ambassador 20 years older than her.

201
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:03,362
He was her professor. He was married.
A whole drama, I hear.

202
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,563
Now, that's some good stuff.

203
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:09,096
Look, by the way,
you deserve a good night's sleep.

204
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:12,303
If I were you,
I'd turn the ringers on my phone off.

205
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:20,317
Hey, Erica.

206
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:24,017
- Why are we meeting here, Merrill?
- For the chili.

207
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,123
No. Why are we meeting out
in the open like this?

208
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:30,492
We're not out in the open, Erica.
No one knows who you are.

209
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:33,088
Now tomorrow,
when that goddamn story comes out,

210
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:37,101
tomorrow you'll be out in the open. Shit!

211
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:39,899
Your husband had to go
and write those articles, didn't he?

212
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,098
Keep him out of this.

213
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:44,199
You're right, Erica. It's not Oscar's fault.

214
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:49,407
Oscar hasn't been trained in covert ops.
Oscar didn't take an oath of secrecy.

215
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,814
No, it's your fault.
You shouldn't have told him anything.

216
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:55,843
Okay, hey, guys. Here's the SITREP.

217
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:59,288
The paper will be out in 2 hours.
They haven't put it up on the Net.

218
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:01,019
They didn't want to give
the West Coast papers a chance

219
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:03,755
to put it in their morning editions.
And Justice is scrambling.

220
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:07,321
They're bringing in a special prosecutor
to find out who exposed you.

221
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,231
I can't believe this.

222
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:13,562
I mean, our kids go to school together,

223
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:16,601
you know, the reporter's kid and mine.

224
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,701
Wait a second. You know her?

225
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:23,941
Well, I kind of recognized her today,
but we'd never spoken before that moment.

226
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:26,917
Let me ask you straight out, Erica.
Was it you?

227
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:29,921
- Was it me, what?
- Was it you who leaked to the Sun Times?

228
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:31,581
I mean, it's understandable.

229
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:35,149
The White House ignored your report,
and you got pissed.

230
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:38,759
You goaded Oscar to write those
quote-unquote, opinion pieces.

231
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:40,731
When that didn't get traction,
you went to the press yourself.

232
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,233
I went to the press myself.

233
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:44,963
Someone you knew. Someone you trusted.

234
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:46,868
Fuck you.

235
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:49,764
Fuck me? Touche.

236
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,271
The prosecutor, Patton Dubois,
he'll be in tomorrow.

237
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:56,939
He'll get Armstrong before the grand jury.

238
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:58,950
Law says
Armstrong has to give up her source.

239
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:00,280
Could it have been Oscar?

240
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:02,877
No. Could it have been you, O'Hara?

241
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:07,290
How we all doing? Still doing good?

242
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:08,587
- Doing good.
- You sure?

243
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:10,322
- Good.
- All right.

244
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,454
I'm gonna put you on the box. Oscar, too.

245
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:16,558
Fine. But I want everybody in
the agency who knows my identity,

246
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,594
I want them with polygraph wires
up their asses, too,

247
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:20,934
because there's a traitor among us.

248
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:23,372
We'll find that person if they're in the CIA.

249
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:26,673
Nonetheless, we should think about
relocating you for your own good.

250
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,579
No. No.
I will send Allison away for a little while,

251
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:33,675
but none of this shit was my fault.
I'm not gonna be punished.

252
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:36,353
This Lois Lane and her newspaper,

253
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:39,289
I'm not gonna let her turn me
into a scared little girl.

254
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:41,019
I'm staying here.

255
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:43,291
Whatever.

256
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:47,889
In the meantime, we'll assign
a protective detail to your home.

257
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:51,868
I feel so much safer. Thank you.

258
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:55,802
I can't fucking believe this.

259
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:36,942
Mommy.

260
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,787
- Wanna stay home from school today?
- Yeah.

261
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:52,090
This is very interesting. It's awesome.

262
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:55,461
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Wow.

263
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:59,034
I didn't realize they made
so much coffee in India.

264
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:01,299
It also has the most democrats in the world.

265
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:04,831
Well, not quite. India is the
biggest democracy in the world.

266
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:07,606
- Isn't that the same thing?
- No, it's not the same thing.

267
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,170
Jesus Christ.

268
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:16,180
Don't give your carrots to Brandon today.
Okay?

269
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:17,847
Okay, Mom.

270
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:22,051
You did it.

271
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:25,722
This changes everything.
You're gonna win a Pulitzer.

272
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:28,623
I don't know about that.

273
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:36,837
- Timmy, come on. Eat your breakfast.
- I don't like them.

274
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:39,002
Come on, don't give Mommy a hard time.
Finish your eggs.

275
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:42,343
- Eggs give you cancer.
- Eggs don't give you cancer.

276
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:46,316
All right, you know what?
I'll finish your cancer, okay. Okay?

277
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:51,845
Feels pretty good though.
That was a lot of work.

278
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:56,053
You didn't tell me half the stuff
that's in here.

279
00:14:56,128 --> 00:15:00,622
Well, you don't tell me anything
that goes into your novels, so it's fair.

280
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:02,326
A spokesman for the newspaper says

281
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:05,928
because her husband is a Vocal opponent
of the administration,

282
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:10,032
this makes Mrs. Van Doren's employment
with the CIA absolutely newsworthy.

283
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:12,077
- Mom?
- In Mexico City...

284
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,407
- What's up, kiddo?
- Can we go to the zoo today?

285
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:19,110
To the zoo? It's a school day.

286
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:21,084
Maybe we can go tonight?

287
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:23,451
Well, the animals are sleeping at night.

288
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:25,217
You don't want to mess
with sleeping animals.

289
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,316
They might be a bit cranky.

290
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:32,961
Okay, come on, sweetie,
you're gonna be late.

291
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:35,796
- You got your stuff?
- You want to finish it?

292
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:37,529
Great, thank you.

293
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:47,645
Hey. Come on, you're forgetting.
Give me a kiss.

294
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,441
I love you. Have a good day.

295
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:53,817
Hey, Connor.

296
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:58,489
I'm sorry, you scared the hell out of me.

297
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:01,993
I'm Special Agent Coddington.
I'm with the FBl.

298
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:04,359
We need you to come with us, please.

299
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:05,658
What for?

300
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:09,929
I don't know, ma'am. They just asked me
to come here and pick you up.

301
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:13,664
Hey there, Miss Armstrong. Come on in.

302
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:18,304
I'm Patton Dubois, federal prosecutor.

303
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:20,208
Please come on in. Thanks for coming by.

304
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,803
Did I have a choice?

305
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,575
Of course you did.

306
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:26,477
I don't have anything to say,

307
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:29,851
so if you have a problem,
contact my editors.

308
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:32,446
Can I get you a cup of coffee?

309
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:34,116
No, thank you.

310
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:36,286
Sure, sir, I'm gonna take some.

311
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:38,387
Great scoop, by the way.

312
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:42,155
If this doesn't make your career,
God knows what will.

313
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,363
Holy moly.

314
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:48,005
That was something.

315
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:52,706
Well, I'm gonna be announced in a few days,

316
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:55,076
just as soon as
all the paperwork goes through,

317
00:16:55,147 --> 00:17:00,312
as the special counsel to investigate
this leak about Erica Van Doren.

318
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:05,080
- That was fast.
- Yeah, I know, it's kind of unusual,

319
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:09,594
but the boys over at Justice seem to
think this is a pretty urgent matter,

320
00:17:09,661 --> 00:17:11,652
a not-a-second-to-lose kind of thing.

321
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:14,290
So they called me in last night,

322
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:18,462
and I just checked into the hotel
this morning, and here we are.

323
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:22,496
The Attorney General's office
has to disqualify itself.

324
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:25,975
Maybe somebody over there
was your source, eh?

325
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,877
- I think I should call my lawyer.
- That's not necessary.

326
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:31,916
I'm not gonna be asking you any questions.

327
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:36,012
Not here, anyway.
This is neither the time nor the place.

328
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:40,349
I just wanted to get kind
of an unofficial head start.

329
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,529
Can I talk to you off the record?

330
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:47,958
Sure.

331
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,760
I mean, a just- between- you- and- me
kind of thing.

332
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:53,728
Off the record is off the record.

333
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:57,572
Okay, good. I'll do all the yada- yada.

334
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:03,710
Now, you were within your rights
to print the information that you obtained.

335
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:05,511
However, you're not within your rights

336
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:09,953
to protect who it was that gave
Erica up to you, who exposed her.

337
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:14,717
It's a 1982 law called the
Intelligence Identities Protection Act.

338
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:17,285
Your source is in a great deal of trouble.

339
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:19,262
- I've no intention of discussing my source...
- Hold on.

340
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:21,765
I'm doing the yada- yada, remember?

341
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,393
Okay.

342
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:25,603
Okay, look,

343
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:29,333
you're gonna be asked
to appear before a grand jury.

344
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:31,399
You're gonna be asked
to identify your source.

345
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:32,774
I'll be doing the asking.

346
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:36,679
Now, if, for some reason,
you don't reveal your source,

347
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:39,615
you'll be held in contempt,
and that means jail time,

348
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:42,848
and we're not talking about
some sort of a Martha Stewart cell

349
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:44,912
with a butler, nonsense.

350
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:48,919
Look.

351
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:52,828
Rachel, go to your source.

352
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:56,495
Ask him to permit you to reveal his name.

353
00:18:56,568 --> 00:19:00,060
You may be surprised at
his willingness to protect you.

354
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:04,538
People are inherently decent, I have found.

355
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:11,613
Well, if that were true, that
would put you out of a job, no?

356
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:19,388
Well, that's all I've got to say.
You'll be notified of your court date.

357
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,756
I'm afraid I'm gonna disappoint you,
Mr. Dubois.

358
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,262
That's not possible.

359
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:31,665
- You ready? Here she is.
- Here she is.

360
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:32,863
Ready to roll?

361
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:35,201
Rolling.

362
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:38,141
Hey, Erica,
why do you think your report was ignored?

363
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:42,203
Is Erica your real name?
How long have you been with the agency?

364
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:44,779
All right, I know you're trying
to do your jobs, okay.

365
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:49,446
I'd love to speak to you.
Now is not a good time.

366
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:52,085
I have an appointment here
to read to the kids.

367
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:53,283
Is Erica your real name?

368
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,622
Did you give your husband
top- secret information?

369
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,889
Does your family know that you're here?

370
00:19:57,963 --> 00:19:59,828
You know, I'm a mom.

371
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:05,826
If this CIA report exists,
as the Sun Times claims it does,

372
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:07,701
that would seem to indicate
the President launched

373
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:10,537
a full- fledged act of war in Venezuela

374
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:11,598
- without justification...
- Thanks.

375
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:14,271
- Really nice work.
- ... and just based on his own gut instinct.

376
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:17,713
It would also mean that either the President
lied to the nation and the Congress...

377
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:20,775
Hey, Rache, they're waiting
for you in Bonnie's office.

378
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:24,913
...what is arguably the worst foreign policy
decision in this nation's history.

379
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,787
So far, the White House
is standing by its actions,

380
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:27,950
but they're not denying the report.

381
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:29,789
- Rachel.
- Yeah, I'm going.

382
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:31,726
- Kick- ass story, by the way.
- Thank you.

383
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:33,492
...there's a reason to question the findings.

384
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:36,033
"'Wait for me. Wait for me.
I'm a fast runner,' said Ruthie.

385
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:37,898
"'And I'd sure like to catch something great,'

386
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,733
"she added, with a fishing pole in hand.

387
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:44,504
"So off they went. Up a hill, down a path,
through a grove of trees,

388
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:49,946
"and just as Granny Annie was about to
tell Ruthie what she was going to catch... "

389
00:20:50,148 --> 00:20:53,640
If I'd been a little bit more forceful with you
and Larry, saying don't rush this to press,

390
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:55,016
maybe we wouldn't be in this situation.

391
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:58,784
I told you, the government's gonna take this
very seriously. I told...

392
00:20:58,857 --> 00:21:01,849
The next time the FBl hauls you
into a fucking interrogation,

393
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,361
- your 1st goddamn phone call is to me!
- I got it. I'm sorry.

394
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:08,263
Before you even take off your
fucking seat belt, you call me!

395
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:10,295
All right, Avril.

396
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:13,504
You okay?

397
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:18,236
Yeah, I was dropping Timmy off
at school, and the FBl were there,

398
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,642
and they asked me to go with them and...

399
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:23,545
Pretty unnerving, huh?
Being questioned like that.

400
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:26,976
- It was really fast.
- They want your source, right?

401
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:31,045
Yeah. I didn't give it to them.
I won't give it to them. No way.

402
00:21:31,256 --> 00:21:33,156
Okay, please.

403
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:43,062
First of all, this is appalling behavior
on the part of the FBl.

404
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:46,298
Snatching you in front of your kid.
Strong- arming you.

405
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:48,703
I want to know the name of the agent
that interviewed you.

406
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:51,800
Well, it wasn't an FBl agent.
It was this guy Patton Dubois.

407
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:54,710
He's being appointed special prosecutor.

408
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:59,182
What? You know him?

409
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:00,709
No.

410
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:04,221
No. But a special prosecutor,
that's no good.

411
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:07,124
See, his only requirement
is to find your source,

412
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:08,682
with nothing else to divert him.

413
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:12,389
He's gonna have unlimited time,
unlimited moolah,

414
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:13,954
and the chance of unlimited publicity.

415
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:17,729
There's a lot more investigative power for
a special prosecutor than there is for a Fed.

416
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:21,204
Yeah, well, not enough power
to make me reveal my source.

417
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:23,833
I have a right to protect my source.

418
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:27,135
- What?
- The federal government

419
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:31,478
doesn't have a shield law.
Not on issues of national security.

420
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:34,041
49 states do have some form of protection
for journalists,

421
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:36,485
- but not the federal government.
- The administration will back off

422
00:22:36,555 --> 00:22:38,682
when they see how far we will go
to protect Rachel.

423
00:22:38,757 --> 00:22:41,783
The federal government is fighting
for a principle, too.

424
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:46,092
You see, somebody revealed
top secret information to you.

425
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:49,860
That is an act of treason.
That is how they see it.

426
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:51,664
They're gonna take this very, very seriously.

427
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:54,968
Yeah, well, so am I,
gonna take it very seriously.

428
00:22:57,743 --> 00:22:59,472
- Officer, what's the hold- up?
- Sorry, ma'am.

429
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:02,203
Are you kidding? My house is right there.

430
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,078
- She's on the list.
- All right, go ahead.

431
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:13,082
I want a half- hour of reading every day.

432
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:14,523
- You hear me?
- Am I going to get into trouble

433
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:16,959
- for not going to school?
- No.

434
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:19,155
- I'll miss my friends.
- I know you will,

435
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,391
but it's just gonna be for a little while.

436
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:21,932
You're gonna have a private tutor.
He's really great.

437
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,230
You'll love him. I promise. Kisses.

438
00:23:24,936 --> 00:23:27,734
Butterfly kiss, Eskimo kiss.

439
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:32,700
I love you.

440
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:34,075
I told you this would happen.

441
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:37,480
- You just don't get it, do you?
- This is your fault.

442
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:39,642
What do you want to listen to, baby?

443
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:41,709
Who's your best friend?

444
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,510
- Who?
- You!

445
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,354
Bye!

446
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:09,479
Are we off the record?

447
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:14,018
Sure. I'll meet you in the back.

448
00:24:23,695 --> 00:24:27,426
You didn't come here to kick my ass,
did you? 'Cause it's not fair.

449
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:29,228
I'm not trained in that whole,

450
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:32,361
"Knock somebody's nose into their brain
with the palm of my hand," thing.

451
00:24:32,437 --> 00:24:34,371
No, I use poison darts.

452
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:37,135
Funny.

453
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:44,479
I like your mums.
The yellow ones are very cheerful.

454
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:46,940
Thank you.

455
00:24:47,018 --> 00:24:49,282
Is your husband still writing?

456
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:53,689
Yeah, all the time. Every day.

457
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:58,559
I read his novel about the Mossad.
I read it while I was on vacation. It was...

458
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:01,622
It was very entertaining.

459
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:07,831
Thank you. He's just trying
to get out the second one.

460
00:25:10,475 --> 00:25:11,601
So...

461
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,948
I'm sorry I lost my cool with you.

462
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:22,383
Usually it takes a man to bring
out the heinous bitch in me.

463
00:25:24,122 --> 00:25:25,987
Oscar and I...

464
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:32,091
It's probably it, you know,
the dagger and all.

465
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:35,825
He's gone. He left.

466
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:39,993
We had it out, and he
went to go stay with Allison

467
00:25:40,071 --> 00:25:42,539
'cause we had to send her away, too.

468
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:44,665
Allison's a great kid.

469
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:46,976
She seems very grounded.

470
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:50,105
How do you know her?
You been digging in her past, too?

471
00:25:50,181 --> 00:25:52,979
No. No, I'm a room mother.

472
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:56,987
Room mother? Man.
You should get hazard pay for that.

473
00:25:57,923 --> 00:26:02,758
I come in once every 2 weeks to read
to the kids. It's a big production.

474
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:03,816
- Mom?
- I love it.

475
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,260
I'm outside, Timmy!

476
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:07,624
What can I do for you?

477
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:11,533
I know you can't tell me who your source is.
I respect that. Okay?

478
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:13,833
I know about keeping secrets.

479
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:18,865
Just tell me yes or no. All right? Is...

480
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:21,870
Is it someone close to me?

481
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:24,341
Is it?

482
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:28,010
Is it someone I work with?

483
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:30,953
I can't tell you anything.

484
00:26:34,459 --> 00:26:36,051
You know what?

485
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:39,619
When you go before the grand jury,
you will have to speak.

486
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:41,495
- You are an unpatriotic little cunt...
- Okay.

487
00:26:41,566 --> 00:26:44,194
who's gonna walk right off the plank
into the bowels of hell.

488
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:46,499
- Do you know that?
- I hear that every day.

489
00:26:46,571 --> 00:26:49,768
If you want to go on record,
we'll give you amazing placement.

490
00:26:49,841 --> 00:26:51,502
Thank you.

491
00:26:51,576 --> 00:26:53,840
- What?
- Hi, Mrs. Van Doren.

492
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:56,346
Hello, handsome. How are you?

493
00:26:56,414 --> 00:27:00,851
How's Allison doing?
She hasn't been in school. Is she sick?

494
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:04,578
No, no, no. She is great. She's...

495
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:06,521
She's just spending time with a relative.

496
00:27:06,591 --> 00:27:09,822
- Can you tell her I said hi?
- You bet. Yes, I will.

497
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:26,334
Is it the door?

498
00:27:34,085 --> 00:27:35,382
Yeah?

499
00:27:35,453 --> 00:27:38,047
- Rachel Armstrong?
- What do you need?

500
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:39,647
I'm here to serve you, ma'am.

501
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:41,988
I just barely had time to type that up
and get over here.

502
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:45,052
- Is it okay? Does it make sense to you?
- Yeah.

503
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:47,428
I thought the law was supposed
to move slowly?

504
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,228
Except for when it doesn't.

505
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,996
Hey, this is all bullshit, barging in
on you in the middle of the night,

506
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:54,698
dragging you into the Mayflower,
it's all just meant to intimidate you.

507
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:55,865
It's working.

508
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:58,670
- Well, don't let it intimidate you. Okay?
- Okay.

509
00:27:58,743 --> 00:28:00,768
You're gonna be fine.

510
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:02,845
Miss Armstrong.

511
00:28:02,914 --> 00:28:04,074
Okay, I'll be down in the lobby.

512
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:05,912
- Okay.
- Don't worry.

513
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:11,049
Rachel Alice Armstrong.
15 Trinity Pass, Washington, D.C.

514
00:28:11,122 --> 00:28:13,818
Thanks. Okay, Miss Armstrong.

515
00:28:13,892 --> 00:28:17,851
You work as a reporter for the
Capital Sun Times, is that correct?

516
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:19,021
Yes.

517
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:23,791
As the national political correspondent,
is that right?

518
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:27,031
- I am, yes. One of them.
- Okay, good.

519
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:29,835
Okay, great. I'm batting a thousand.

520
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:34,538
You wrote an article a few days ago, here,

521
00:28:34,612 --> 00:28:37,706
in which you revealed Erica Van Doren,

522
00:28:37,782 --> 00:28:41,479
married to the former US ambassador,
Oscar Van Doren,

523
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:44,317
that she was a covert CIA operative.

524
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:45,413
I did, yes.

525
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:49,256
And you feel confident
with this story's veracity?

526
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:50,692
I do, 100%%.

527
00:28:53,098 --> 00:28:54,895
Who was your source?

528
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:01,230
- Miss Armstrong...
- One second. I'm sorry.

529
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:03,331
"I respectfully refuse
to answer that question

530
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,035
"on the grounds that
it would violate my rights

531
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:08,307
"under the 1st Amendment
and federal common law. "

532
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,445
You're aware that anybody
with official knowledge

533
00:29:13,518 --> 00:29:16,043
of the identity of a CIA operative

534
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:19,420
is forbidden by law to
release that information?

535
00:29:19,824 --> 00:29:21,189
I am, yes.

536
00:29:21,726 --> 00:29:23,751
So, who was your source?

537
00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:25,455
I can't reveal my source...

538
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,657
Okay, look, Miss Armstrong.

539
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:31,559
This is a very serious matter.

540
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:33,866
I want you to take your time.

541
00:29:34,506 --> 00:29:39,239
We're gonna take a recess
and come back at, say, 1:30.

542
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:43,512
I want you to go home.
I want you to talk to your family.

543
00:29:43,581 --> 00:29:46,345
I want you to talk to your editor. Okay?

544
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:49,720
And then I want you to talk to your source.

545
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:54,622
Mull it over and see if you all think
this is worth a contempt citation,

546
00:29:54,692 --> 00:29:56,819
and then we're gonna reconvene,

547
00:29:56,895 --> 00:29:59,455
and then I'm going to ask you again.

548
00:30:00,865 --> 00:30:01,889
I wouldn't hold your breath.

549
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:05,333
Well, I'm not the one
that'll need to hold my breath.

550
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,869
Okay, everybody,

551
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:14,179
we're gonna break it up.
We'll come back at 1:30.

552
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:24,212
- How long have you been in the CIA?
- Ms. Van Doren...

553
00:30:24,923 --> 00:30:26,515
"'Can I come too?' asked Charlie.

554
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:29,526
"'I promise to help you catch
whatever it is,' he said.

555
00:30:29,594 --> 00:30:31,824
"'Come on,' said Ruthie Joe
and Granny Annie.

556
00:30:31,896 --> 00:30:33,625
"So off they went across the bridge... "

557
00:30:33,698 --> 00:30:35,689
My watch says I'm early.

558
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:41,372
We just feel like this is not the best time
for you to be with the kids.

559
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,334
It's just that,

560
00:30:43,408 --> 00:30:47,538
you know, we're really not equipped
to deal with a lot of craziness.

561
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:48,738
Okay.

562
00:30:49,247 --> 00:30:52,580
I think it's idiotic, is what it is.
I understand, the press can be a nightmare.

563
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:56,848
Maybe if you were to stay away for
a while, then they would go away.

564
00:30:57,322 --> 00:31:00,814
I hope we can work this out, Jerry.
I really look forward to reading to the kids.

565
00:31:00,892 --> 00:31:03,520
I mean, I'm pretty good at it, too.
I do all the little voices.

566
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:05,529
You are. So...

567
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:09,055
When were you planning
on bringing Ali back to school?

568
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:12,032
I don't know. I'm not sure.

569
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:14,537
I see. Okay.

570
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:21,546
Are you saying
that she can't come back, Jerry?

571
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,244
- How was your lunch?
- Terrific. Thank you.

572
00:31:24,315 --> 00:31:27,341
- Yeah, what'd you have?
- I actually didn't have anything.

573
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:28,646
Really?

574
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:31,417
I wish I had your will power.

575
00:31:32,857 --> 00:31:35,587
Your source, Miss Armstrong, who is it?

576
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:42,691
Hey.

577
00:31:44,168 --> 00:31:45,931
Well? How did it go?

578
00:31:46,004 --> 00:31:48,564
- Okay, I guess.
- Excuse me. Rachel Armstrong?

579
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,232
- Yes.
- I'm Deputy U.S. Marshal Jones.

580
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:53,334
I have a summons for you to appear
in US District Court in 2 hours.

581
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,811
- No, no, no.
- What happened to 2 weeks?

582
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,040
Hey!

583
00:31:58,316 --> 00:31:59,340
I'm Avril Aaronson,

584
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:00,475
- counsel to the Capital Sun Times.
- Oh, yeah,

585
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:03,987
I read your amicus brief on
the Celeste matter last year.

586
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:06,216
I think you could take credit
for her release. I really do.

587
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:08,953
I understand all the theatrics
up until now, but this?

588
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:11,359
This is too fast. This is outrageous,

589
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:14,159
and we're getting into some pretty
serious 5th Amendment issues here.

590
00:32:14,232 --> 00:32:20,068
Look, Avril, there's a traitor out there
revealing the names of CIA operatives.

591
00:32:20,138 --> 00:32:24,802
Now, I think we should get somebody
like that out tout de suite. Don't you?

592
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:27,344
We're bringing in Albert Burnside.

593
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:31,880
I'll have to go home and get
my autograph book, then.

594
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:38,618
Don't worry about it. It's not a problem.
It's already in the Sun Times budget.

595
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:39,884
Hi, Avril.

596
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:43,587
Hey, there he is. Albert, thanks for coming.
This is Rachel Armstrong.

597
00:32:43,661 --> 00:32:44,787
- Glad to meet you.
- Hi, me, too.

598
00:32:44,862 --> 00:32:48,127
Hey, I'm Ray, Rachel's husband.
Why is this happening so fast?

599
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:50,690
Avril said it'd be weeks
until I went before a judge.

600
00:32:50,768 --> 00:32:54,829
Well, Mr. Dubois wants to get this done
before the press catches up.

601
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:57,670
It's okay. The press can
just complicate things.

602
00:32:57,742 --> 00:32:59,710
Let's concentrate on keeping you out of jail.

603
00:32:59,777 --> 00:33:00,937
Jail? What do you... When?

604
00:33:01,012 --> 00:33:02,570
You're gonna ask for a continuance?

605
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,842
Yeah. Sure. Sure.

606
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:08,079
Look, I've been through this.
Judge Hall is a good egg.

607
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:10,052
We exchange Christmas cards.

608
00:33:10,121 --> 00:33:12,419
He's certainly not gonna jail you today.

609
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:13,855
- Jesus Christ.
- Ray, relax.

610
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:16,826
I mean, if Albert's this calm,
then we can be, too. Right?

611
00:33:16,894 --> 00:33:18,987
We'll be out of here in 4 minutes.

612
00:33:19,063 --> 00:33:22,658
Then we'll get a cup of joe and we'll
strategize how we can protect you

613
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:27,137
and the constitution and democracy itself
for generations to come.

614
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:30,033
That's a Theory, right?

615
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:31,370
- Yeah.
- It's classy.

616
00:33:31,442 --> 00:33:33,535
Thanks. Nice suit.

617
00:33:34,145 --> 00:33:38,741
It's not a suit. It's a Zegna.
Hand stitched, 15 mil mil 15.

618
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:42,044
What's that you're wearing?

619
00:33:43,721 --> 00:33:45,211
I don't know.

620
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:48,524
I'm putting you in touch with my tailor.

621
00:33:48,593 --> 00:33:51,357
You always know when you're in a Zegna.

622
00:33:51,629 --> 00:33:52,653
Court room 3

623
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:57,167
Your Honor, this morning, Miss Armstrong
appeared before the grand jury.

624
00:33:57,668 --> 00:33:59,863
I furnished you with the transcripts.

625
00:33:59,937 --> 00:34:05,637
And as you know, she was asked to reveal
the name of the source who provided her,

626
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:09,703
quite possibly illegally, with
secret information revealing the

627
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:12,079
Excuse me, Your Honor. If I may?

628
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,242
Yes.

629
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:15,677
- All right?
- It's perfectly okay with me.

630
00:34:15,753 --> 00:34:18,085
Your Honor, I just met my client.

631
00:34:18,156 --> 00:34:22,786
I ask you to continue this matter for, say,
a week, so we can get our bearings here.

632
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:25,351
Let me get my bearings first.
Why don't we proceed for now?

633
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:26,920
Well, here's how it is, Your Honor.

634
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:31,435
Mr. Dubois will say that my client was asked
to name her source

635
00:34:31,502 --> 00:34:34,767
and that she won't do so,
and, thus, you should compel her.

636
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:39,173
He'll say that the information
that my client received is highly classified

637
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:43,703
and the GJ is entitled to know
the name of the source and to find it out.

638
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:48,418
He'll also say that there's no
federal shield law protecting her

639
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:50,579
and that there's no
1st Amendment protection, either,

640
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:54,523
because this is a matter of,
quote- unquote, national security.

641
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,590
Is that about right, Mr. Dubois?

642
00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:58,219
In fact, that's it in a nutshell.

643
00:34:58,296 --> 00:35:02,892
We contend that the 1st Amendment
does protect Rachel Armstrong.

644
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:06,698
I'm well aware of cases in this circuit
in which this contention is...

645
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:09,604
Well, I am aware
of those cases in this circuit,

646
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:14,304
and they do not authorize her to
refuse to respond to these questions.

647
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:16,676
Why don't the 3 of you
come up here right now?

648
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:19,011
Rachel, Rachel, come on. Come on up.

649
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:25,087
Over here to where the bench is.

650
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:27,519
Miss Armstrong, I want you to understand

651
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:31,187
that if I should order you
to reveal your source,

652
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:36,424
that if you don't do so,
I'm gonna hold you in contempt of court

653
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:39,402
and that you will be jailed until you...

654
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,097
Hold on, Your Honor.

655
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:44,437
Can you rule, please,
on my request for a continuance?

656
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:46,943
Right. I'm gonna deny that motion.

657
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:48,672
I'm only asking for a few days, Judge.

658
00:35:48,746 --> 00:35:50,714
I understand.
There is a serious national security...

659
00:35:50,781 --> 00:35:53,249
There's no reason
not to grant a continuance.

660
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:55,842
Let me run my courtroom.

661
00:35:57,822 --> 00:36:02,919
Now, Miss Armstrong, I direct you
to reveal the identity of your source.

662
00:36:03,728 --> 00:36:07,562
If you want a few days to
consider it, I'll give it to you.

663
00:36:08,399 --> 00:36:10,162
I can't do that.

664
00:36:10,234 --> 00:36:13,692
Mr. Burnside, if you want a few days
to advise her to obey my order.

665
00:36:13,771 --> 00:36:16,899
I can't advise my client
to betray a confidence.

666
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:18,904
Okay, look, Your Honor,

667
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:21,945
given the direct threat
to our national security,

668
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:25,881
I ask that Miss Armstrong
now be held in contempt of court

669
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:28,475
and that she be jailed immediately.

670
00:36:30,087 --> 00:36:35,218
Well, it seems to me that I have before me
somebody who is defying my order

671
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:39,323
and who seems to believe
that she is above the law itself.

672
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,166
I hold you in contempt of court,

673
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:46,431
and I remand you to the custody
of the United States Marshal.

674
00:36:46,504 --> 00:36:48,062
- Help.
- Judge...

675
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:50,937
Wait. No, no. Your Honor. Judge.
Wait... No, wait.

676
00:36:51,008 --> 00:36:52,873
- Ma'am.
- Your Honor!

677
00:36:52,944 --> 00:36:55,435
As soon as you're prepared to speak,
you will be released.

678
00:36:55,513 --> 00:36:57,071
Could I have a minute
with my client to confer?

679
00:36:57,148 --> 00:36:58,979
You may consult with her
in the detention center.

680
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,951
Timmy needs to be picked up
from the Hobermans' at 5:30.

681
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:03,748
- This proceeding is closed.
- Judge.

682
00:37:03,821 --> 00:37:06,585
Judge. Your Honor!

683
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:10,193
A lot of people looking to get famous here.

684
00:37:10,861 --> 00:37:13,796
- So now what? What do we do now?
- I'll call you tomorrow. Don't worry about it.

685
00:37:13,864 --> 00:37:16,059
- What are you gonna do now?
- I'm gonna call you in the morning.

686
00:37:16,133 --> 00:37:17,760
All right? Okay?

687
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:21,270
Well, at least you'll take him
off your Christmas card list. Right?

688
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:22,533
That's right.

689
00:37:23,207 --> 00:37:25,266
- It's a scare tactic.
- You think?

690
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,806
I'll deal with it.
I'll see you back at the paper.

691
00:37:27,878 --> 00:37:30,005
Okay, I'll head over there.

692
00:37:30,615 --> 00:37:34,676
Mr. Burnside, this is a real honor for me.

693
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:38,349
I studied you, growing up.
My dad was also a lawyer.

694
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:41,585
This is a big, big mistake, Patton.

695
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:43,422
Well, there's nothing like
learning from our mistakes.

696
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:48,124
Yeah, well, sometimes a mistake
is like wearing white after Labor Day,

697
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:51,657
and sometimes, a mistake
is invading Russia in winter.

698
00:38:24,368 --> 00:38:27,394
Okay, there are 2 things I need to know.

699
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:30,099
- First, the story itself.
- Rock solid.

700
00:38:30,174 --> 00:38:33,075
Rock solid. Well, are we talking talc
or are we talking granite?

701
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:35,078
Albert, please.
We wouldn't have put it through

702
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,512
- if it wasn't...
- Okay. Second,

703
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:39,042
how many people know the...

704
00:38:39,116 --> 00:38:41,778
How many people at the paper know
the names of the sources?

705
00:38:41,852 --> 00:38:45,015
We know the corroborating source.
Well, Bonnie does, anyway,

706
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:48,889
and one of Rachel's sources at the FBl
gave us a copy of Van Doren's report.

707
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:51,086
And why don't you have
the name of the original source?

708
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:54,256
Well, for one thing, Rachel agreed
to complete confidentiality,

709
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:57,267
and because her story was confirmed,
it wasn't necessary to know.

710
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,735
Well, the good news is,
you can't be compelled to testify

711
00:38:59,804 --> 00:39:01,965
on something you don't know.

712
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:03,438
Bosca wallet.

713
00:39:06,744 --> 00:39:08,473
Prada sunglasses.

714
00:39:09,947 --> 00:39:12,438
- You can keep that.
- Thank you.

715
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:14,143
Tape recorder...

716
00:39:15,152 --> 00:39:17,814
I'm gonna need to get your jewelry.

717
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,557
The wedding ring.

718
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:29,426
I'd like to hold on to those.

719
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:33,061
It's diamond, baby doll.
You don't want that in there.

720
00:39:38,075 --> 00:39:40,703
Miss Armstrong, come up front, please.

721
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:50,149
Take a stand in front of the machine, please.

722
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:53,088
Would you give me your right palm, please?

723
00:39:54,425 --> 00:39:56,222
Take it off. Left, please.

724
00:39:56,293 --> 00:39:58,853
<i>It feels like his only real target
is Rachel Armstrong</i>

725
00:39:58,963 --> 00:40:02,626
<i>for publishing the article,
which is not a crime. In fact...</i>

726
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:06,602
Okay, if we've got Armstrong in jail,
that's our biggest ace in the hole.

727
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:09,833
2. The Van Dorens
and everyone at the CIA

728
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:13,638
who worked with her
have agreed to submit to polygraphs.

729
00:40:13,711 --> 00:40:17,738
Jeez, could we turn this guy off?
I can't listen to this anymore.

730
00:40:18,282 --> 00:40:19,715
Better.

731
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:24,050
You know, that's the only thing
that Armstrong's got going for her

732
00:40:24,121 --> 00:40:28,319
is the media, getting them to turn her
into some sort of a cause celeb.

733
00:40:28,959 --> 00:40:31,086
We can't allow that to affect us.

734
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:34,325
Well, under the Branzburg case,
they've got no chance on appeal.

735
00:40:34,498 --> 00:40:36,466
Even if they point out
that you didn't exhaust

736
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:38,764
any other possible sources
before going to her.

737
00:40:38,836 --> 00:40:41,396
Yeah. No, the Miller case
made that perfectly clear.

738
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:44,269
- Sit still for the camera.
- But our objective,

739
00:40:44,341 --> 00:40:48,778
our goal, is not to...
Is not to keep her locked up.

740
00:40:48,846 --> 00:40:50,370
I want to let her go.

741
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:53,383
That means we have got our source
and we can prosecute him,

742
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:56,079
and, frankly, that's all I care about.

743
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:58,684
Sit as still as you can,
looking straight ahead.

744
00:40:58,756 --> 00:41:01,054
Answer with the word "yes"
or the word "no. "

745
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:03,616
Is your name Erica Van Doren?

746
00:41:04,028 --> 00:41:05,120
Yes.

747
00:41:06,263 --> 00:41:08,993
- Were you born in Ossining, New York?
- Yes.

748
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:15,966
Have you ever lied
on any official document?

749
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,098
No.

750
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:24,671
Did you reveal to Ms. Armstrong
you were an employee of the CIA?

751
00:41:25,282 --> 00:41:26,806
You gotta know a few rules.

752
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:30,081
First, ain't no smoking
anywhere in the building.

753
00:41:30,454 --> 00:41:32,251
Cigarettes are contraband.

754
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:37,260
No drugs, no fighting.
Fighting just buys you time in deseg.

755
00:41:37,962 --> 00:41:40,362
- What's that?
- Desegregation.

756
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:43,459
In the movies, they call it the hole.

757
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:48,164
I'm taking you to the spillover room.
We house the more violent girls in cells.

758
00:41:48,472 --> 00:41:50,133
What are you, a doorman? Get out of here.

759
00:41:50,207 --> 00:41:52,869
- Come on. Let me out.
- Get out of here. Get out.

760
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:02,618
And ain't no fucking.

761
00:42:03,787 --> 00:42:08,087
No kind of sex at all.
No eating pussy, no kissing, nothing.

762
00:42:08,592 --> 00:42:13,222
If you're here for more than 8 months,
you can apply for a kite or a conjugal.

763
00:42:13,297 --> 00:42:14,525
Here you go.

764
00:42:14,598 --> 00:42:18,398
But the turnover here is normally 2 weeks.
You won't even be here in 8 months.

765
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:19,561
Hey!

766
00:42:20,504 --> 00:42:21,596
Hey!

767
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:24,204
- What's your name?
- Olivia.

768
00:42:24,275 --> 00:42:26,209
- Olivia what?
- Olivia James.

769
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:29,804
- Well, Olivia James, this is Rachel...
- Armstrong.

770
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,508
Rachel Armstrong, your new bunkie.
Be nice.

771
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:34,676
And show her how to make the bed.

772
00:42:34,752 --> 00:42:35,741
There you go.

773
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:38,788
Lights out in an hour.
Lights up at 6:00 in the morning. All right?

774
00:42:38,856 --> 00:42:41,051
Okay. Excuse me.

775
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:43,685
Is there any way of seeing
a newspaper in the morning?

776
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:48,721
No. But if you wanna watch the news,
you have to convince all of them to do it.

777
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:57,832
- On his birthday, who was driving...
- He ain't no fool.

778
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:01,207
- I don't care.
- Ain't no tomming in the yard, you know.

779
00:43:03,347 --> 00:43:04,974
That's just sad.

780
00:43:22,533 --> 00:43:25,400
Are you one of those
trained prevaricators, Erica?

781
00:43:25,469 --> 00:43:29,200
You know, they teach you that
at Langley? Box beater.

782
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:31,371
Kicked ass, didn't I?

783
00:43:35,245 --> 00:43:38,180
Who do you think spoke to her?
To Armstrong?

784
00:43:38,882 --> 00:43:42,682
God damn it. I don't know!

785
00:43:44,521 --> 00:43:45,886
But when you figure it out,

786
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:49,050
just give me 4 minutes
with the prick, okay?

787
00:43:49,259 --> 00:43:53,923
Well, it's been my experience
that Miss Armstrong will tell us.

788
00:43:53,998 --> 00:43:57,126
Right. She's never had her
Vassar ass in jail. She'll break.

789
00:43:57,201 --> 00:44:01,365
I don't know. I met her.
I looked her in the eye.

790
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:03,872
She's a water- walker.

791
00:44:23,861 --> 00:44:25,226
I wish we had the cookies, though.

792
00:44:26,196 --> 00:44:28,460
Those were pretty good.

793
00:44:28,732 --> 00:44:30,324
- Hey. Hey.
- Hey.

794
00:44:30,401 --> 00:44:31,800
Guess who's here?

795
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:34,235
Little man wanted to say hey,
make sure you're okay.

796
00:44:34,304 --> 00:44:35,669
All right. Here he is.

797
00:44:35,773 --> 00:44:37,263
Say hi.

798
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:39,935
- Hey, baby. Hi.
- Hi.

799
00:44:41,612 --> 00:44:44,809
Hey. Why don't you tell Mommy
what we brought her?

800
00:44:44,882 --> 00:44:46,577
- Mom.
- Yeah.

801
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:49,744
We brought you some cookies,
but they took them away.

802
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:51,754
No way.

803
00:44:51,822 --> 00:44:55,383
Well, maybe they'll let me
have them later for dessert.

804
00:44:56,894 --> 00:44:59,863
- Dad made them.
- Dad made them? Yucky.

805
00:45:01,965 --> 00:45:03,159
Hey,

806
00:45:03,767 --> 00:45:06,031
I'm gonna be okay, sweetie.

807
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:10,431
Hey, how was your spelling test?

808
00:45:10,507 --> 00:45:11,974
It was okay, I guess.

809
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:13,373
I bet you aced it.

810
00:45:13,444 --> 00:45:16,607
Practiced really hard, didn't you?
Didn't you?

811
00:45:17,614 --> 00:45:19,411
- Yeah.
- You sure did.

812
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:23,285
Hand the phone to your dad, okay?

813
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:25,787
- Hey.
- Hey.

814
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:29,124
Hey. How are you?

815
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:31,058
- I'm fine.
- Yeah?

816
00:45:32,162 --> 00:45:34,494
Yeah, I'm fine.
Don't bring him anymore, Ray.

817
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:37,125
- This is not a good place for him.
- What are you talking about?

818
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:38,634
He's freaking out.

819
00:45:38,702 --> 00:45:43,196
He wanted to see you. What do you mean?
He wanted to make sure you were okay.

820
00:45:43,273 --> 00:45:46,265
Well, of course he wanted to see me. But...

821
00:45:46,343 --> 00:45:48,777
- I mean, I'm really serious about this, Ray.
- Okay.

822
00:45:48,846 --> 00:45:49,870
I'm not gonna be here forever.

823
00:45:49,947 --> 00:45:53,348
- It's a couple of days. It's a few days.
- Okay. Okay.

824
00:45:55,152 --> 00:45:56,414
So what is going on in the news?

825
00:45:56,487 --> 00:45:58,819
- I haven't heard a thing.
- You haven't?

826
00:45:58,889 --> 00:46:00,550
No, there's no newspapers in here.

827
00:46:00,624 --> 00:46:02,956
The TV is perpetually
tuned into Jerry Springer.

828
00:46:03,026 --> 00:46:06,621
Well, your jailing, your stance,

829
00:46:07,197 --> 00:46:08,960
it's in every newspaper, on every channel.

830
00:46:09,032 --> 00:46:12,229
No, no, no. I mean with the President.
What have they said about the article?

831
00:46:12,302 --> 00:46:14,998
No, same thing. Same as always.

832
00:46:15,072 --> 00:46:18,508
"The White House refuses to
comment on intelligence matters. "

833
00:46:18,575 --> 00:46:20,304
What else are they going to say? Right?

834
00:46:20,377 --> 00:46:25,246
I mean, the President, he's not making
any press conferences, that's for sure.

835
00:46:27,684 --> 00:46:30,209
Hey, listen, I was thinking...

836
00:46:31,054 --> 00:46:35,286
I mean, if this gets crazy, crazier,

837
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:39,618
maybe you should tell me who it is.

838
00:46:39,696 --> 00:46:41,664
And that way, I can maybe talk to the guy.

839
00:46:41,732 --> 00:46:44,633
I don't know, like on a
human level, you know?

840
00:46:44,701 --> 00:46:46,134
- Ray.
- What?

841
00:46:46,203 --> 00:46:48,933
I've never asked you, not once.

842
00:46:50,174 --> 00:46:53,075
But this is... This is getting crazy.

843
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:56,772
Okay, let's not go there. At all.

844
00:46:57,581 --> 00:46:59,845
- You don't trust me?
- That's not the point.

845
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:01,680
You don't trust me?

846
00:47:02,619 --> 00:47:05,179
- Is it... What is...
- I guess that's it. It's over.

847
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:12,527
Okay. I miss you.

848
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:16,090
I miss you, too.
Can you pass the phone back to...

849
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:18,191
- Hey, can you hear me?
- Yeah.

850
00:47:18,268 --> 00:47:21,032
Okay. I need you to make your bed
in the morning. All right?

851
00:47:21,104 --> 00:47:24,540
I need at least one responsible male
in the house.

852
00:47:24,608 --> 00:47:28,100
- Okay? Don't tell Daddy I said that, okay?
- I'll...

853
00:47:35,552 --> 00:47:39,545
She can't hear you, buddy. Okay?
She'll come home soon. Come on.

854
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:57,807
All rise. Hear ye, hear ye.

855
00:47:57,908 --> 00:47:59,637
- Armstrong. Let's go.
- All persons having business

856
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:03,009
with the United States District Court
in the District of Columbia will draw near.

857
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:05,605
Give your attention and you shall be heard.

858
00:48:14,291 --> 00:48:18,990
Mr. Burnside, your client is here now,
so you may proceed when you're ready.

859
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:20,620
Thank you, sir.

860
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:24,898
Your Honor, I would ask
that you would release Ms. Armstrong

861
00:48:24,968 --> 00:48:27,562
until such time as the
U.S. Court of Appeals can rule

862
00:48:27,638 --> 00:48:29,868
on the validity of this contempt citation.

863
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:31,407
Now that would vitiate the whole purpose

864
00:48:31,475 --> 00:48:34,239
of her incarceration in the first place.

865
00:48:34,611 --> 00:48:36,101
She has the key to her own cell.

866
00:48:36,179 --> 00:48:40,513
A key that comes in the form
of a loss of integrity is no key at all.

867
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:42,313
Integrity is subjective.

868
00:48:42,386 --> 00:48:45,514
Miss Armstrong, I'm sympathetic,
but you've gotta help me out.

869
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:48,023
Will you represent to me that if you're home

870
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:52,391
that you'll pick up the phone
and call or contact your source

871
00:48:52,462 --> 00:48:56,091
and try to get permission
for you to release the source's name

872
00:48:56,166 --> 00:48:58,566
so we can put an end to all of this?

873
00:48:58,635 --> 00:49:01,502
I would be dishonest
if I said I could do that.

874
00:49:01,571 --> 00:49:03,903
Well, then, you're really not
giving me any basis at all.

875
00:49:03,974 --> 00:49:05,134
The motion is denied.

876
00:49:05,208 --> 00:49:08,939
Sir, I would ask that the court now

877
00:49:09,012 --> 00:49:13,381
impose a fine of $10,000 a day
against the Sun Times

878
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:16,848
until such time as
Miss Armstrong's source be revealed.

879
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,182
Your Honor,

880
00:49:18,255 --> 00:49:20,280
with all due respect to you,
this court and Miss Armstrong,

881
00:49:20,357 --> 00:49:21,949
we don't know who her source is.

882
00:49:22,025 --> 00:49:23,652
I don't see
how we could be held accountable.

883
00:49:23,727 --> 00:49:27,128
Sir, obviously, with the
representation on display here,

884
00:49:27,197 --> 00:49:30,291
obviously, the paper not only supports,

885
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:33,336
but is encouraging
Miss Armstrong's position.

886
00:49:33,837 --> 00:49:35,771
They're enabling her.

887
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:39,036
The Sun Times should be obliged
to obey Your Honor,

888
00:49:39,109 --> 00:49:41,373
and dismiss Miss Armstrong if she does not.

889
00:49:41,445 --> 00:49:43,242
That is out of line!

890
00:49:43,547 --> 00:49:47,108
Your Honor, respectfully,
I ask you to deny this motion.

891
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:08,229
Don't even think of buckling.
Don't even think it.

892
00:50:09,272 --> 00:50:10,830
You pay the fine,

893
00:50:10,907 --> 00:50:15,071
and you let Rachel hold strong,
exactly the way she's been doing.

894
00:50:18,448 --> 00:50:20,609
You didn't need to say that.

895
00:50:37,134 --> 00:50:39,034
Such a beautiful day.

896
00:50:39,102 --> 00:50:41,229
- I like coming here.
- Yeah.

897
00:50:41,304 --> 00:50:44,330
- It reminds me why we do what we do.
- I agree.

898
00:50:44,408 --> 00:50:46,467
You know, my daddy is
buried right over there.

899
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:49,034
I feel it best that we not meet at Langley

900
00:50:49,112 --> 00:50:50,943
- for the time being.
- Yeah. Okay.

901
00:50:51,014 --> 00:50:53,209
Yeah. You know, I'm just glad
that you asked to see me.

902
00:50:53,283 --> 00:50:56,275
I've been wanting to speak to you
since this all broke.

903
00:50:56,353 --> 00:50:58,878
You know, I was hoping I'd convince you

904
00:50:58,955 --> 00:51:01,480
to give me a crack at
the CBD in the Balkans.

905
00:51:02,759 --> 00:51:05,819
- There's other business to attend to first.
- Okay.

906
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:07,887
Erica, we've investigated
to the fullest degree

907
00:51:07,964 --> 00:51:09,761
all of those people who
were aware of your cover.

908
00:51:09,833 --> 00:51:12,996
We've looked at phone records,
emails, the works.

909
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:14,697
- We're dead ending here.
- Really?

910
00:51:14,771 --> 00:51:17,467
So far, the reporter is in jail and not talking.

911
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:20,999
It's essential we find out
where this leak came from.

912
00:51:21,211 --> 00:51:24,738
I know. I understand. You know,
and I couldn't agree with you more.

913
00:51:24,815 --> 00:51:28,683
You know, we don't know if this person
had it in for you or had it in for the agency,

914
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:30,276
so can I just pick your brain a little bit?

915
00:51:30,353 --> 00:51:32,480
Yeah, of course. Please.
I completely understand.

916
00:51:32,556 --> 00:51:36,117
- Ask me whatever you want.
- When did you first meet Rachel Armstrong?

917
00:51:36,193 --> 00:51:38,855
Knowingly? When she came
to me at the soccer game,

918
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:40,556
when she confronted me.

919
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:44,327
And you're both volunteers at
Potomac Shores Elementary School, right?

920
00:51:44,401 --> 00:51:49,896
I am. Well, no, I'm not.
I was, but I'm not now,

921
00:51:49,973 --> 00:51:51,634
but she was a room mother there, she said.

922
00:51:51,708 --> 00:51:53,835
You never met at school
functions before that?

923
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:56,470
- No.
- Your volunteer work never overlapped?

924
00:51:56,546 --> 00:51:59,276
You guys never perhaps
talked mom to mom?

925
00:51:59,349 --> 00:52:00,680
No. No.

926
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:05,517
Ever go to a school event
where alcohol was being served?

927
00:52:05,589 --> 00:52:07,250
What? What?

928
00:52:08,225 --> 00:52:09,920
You know, when my wife
went to those functions,

929
00:52:09,993 --> 00:52:12,962
those let- your- hair- down things,

930
00:52:13,029 --> 00:52:17,466
my God, I can't tell you the things she said
that she now wishes she could take back.

931
00:52:17,534 --> 00:52:19,161
Sir, wait.

932
00:52:21,238 --> 00:52:23,570
Are you still investigating me?

933
00:52:24,241 --> 00:52:26,038
- Well...
- I just passed a polygraph.

934
00:52:26,109 --> 00:52:28,509
Well, given your training,
I'm not sure how valuable that is.

935
00:52:28,578 --> 00:52:32,844
It is a clinical investigation.
You don't need to take it personally.

936
00:52:33,216 --> 00:52:35,446
I don't need to take it personally?

937
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:38,784
"We think that you're either
incompetent, a drunk, or a liar,

938
00:52:38,855 --> 00:52:41,688
"but you don't need to take it personally. "

939
00:52:43,093 --> 00:52:45,118
How dare you?

940
00:52:46,096 --> 00:52:47,290
- How fucking dare you?
- Okay,

941
00:52:47,364 --> 00:52:50,197
- you need to watch your tone here, Erica.
- Let me ask you a question, sir.

942
00:52:50,267 --> 00:52:53,703
What, in my absolutely unblemished record,
can you point to and say,

943
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:56,568
"Yeah, yeah, that's somebody
we can't trust"?

944
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:00,736
- What?
- Point is, I don't even know you.

945
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:03,240
You've been a NOC for so many years,

946
00:53:03,313 --> 00:53:05,213
there are very few people
who actually know you.

947
00:53:05,282 --> 00:53:07,807
Okay, well, you know what?
I know you. I know you, sir.

948
00:53:07,884 --> 00:53:11,615
I know your type. I see where
this is going. I smell it.

949
00:53:11,721 --> 00:53:13,382
You know, if somebody
in the CIA messed up,

950
00:53:13,456 --> 00:53:15,083
somebody messed up, gave me up

951
00:53:15,158 --> 00:53:18,491
and now you guys are walking around
investigating it like the Keystone Kops.

952
00:53:18,562 --> 00:53:21,531
You're just aching for it to be me. I see it.

953
00:53:21,598 --> 00:53:24,897
This way you can tell the press,
"You know what? It's not a rogue agent.

954
00:53:24,968 --> 00:53:28,096
"It is just some silly little girl
whose feelings got hurt

955
00:53:28,171 --> 00:53:30,071
"that her investigative
conclusions were ignored

956
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:31,630
"by the President of the United States. "

957
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:33,903
Findings that absolved Venezuela

958
00:53:33,977 --> 00:53:36,969
from having anything at all to do
with the assassination attempt on him.

959
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:39,447
- Now you're being dramatic, Erica.
- Fine, okay.

960
00:53:39,516 --> 00:53:42,644
You know what?
You can speak to my attorney from now on.

961
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:44,380
You can drop my protective detail.

962
00:53:44,454 --> 00:53:47,150
You can stop cutting me checks. Okay?
I quit.

963
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:48,691
You don't just quit, Erica.

964
00:53:48,758 --> 00:53:52,694
Really? What is this, The Sopranos?
I can't leave the family? I'm stuck?

965
00:53:52,762 --> 00:53:56,061
Well, it's a process.
You're full of privileged information.

966
00:53:56,132 --> 00:53:59,431
You don't trust me? Fine, okay.

967
00:53:59,769 --> 00:54:02,533
I'm gonna give you reason not to. Okay?

968
00:54:02,973 --> 00:54:05,339
My husband's not the only one
in the family who can write.

969
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:08,502
Look, you sure you want to get
in a war with the government, Erica?

970
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:10,136
Do you need the messiness?

971
00:54:10,213 --> 00:54:11,703
You're in the middle
of a custody battle, right?

972
00:54:11,781 --> 00:54:15,774
You sure you want to drag Allison
into the middle of all this?

973
00:54:16,786 --> 00:54:18,981
You are so lucky you are a woman.

974
00:54:19,055 --> 00:54:20,352
Why is that?

975
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:22,482
Because I don't hit girls.

976
00:54:22,959 --> 00:54:27,396
You know, you weren't the only agent
investigating the Venezuelans,

977
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:29,929
but you were the only one that concluded

978
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,492
that they were not involved
in the attack on the President.

979
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:36,698
Yours is not the only report
the President read.

980
00:54:38,541 --> 00:54:43,137
I wish you the very best of luck
with your daughter and the custody battle.

981
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:45,846
I hope you get to see her again.

982
00:54:49,719 --> 00:54:51,084
Thank you.

983
00:55:16,112 --> 00:55:18,046
Yeah, watch this.

984
00:55:24,421 --> 00:55:28,653
If there was enough money in the world,
I'd be buying my way out of this.

985
00:55:28,725 --> 00:55:31,319
Honey, if there was enough money
in the world, I wouldn't be in here

986
00:55:31,394 --> 00:55:33,726
- in the first place.
- You got that right.

987
00:55:39,235 --> 00:55:40,463
What's that?

988
00:55:40,537 --> 00:55:42,402
A Christmas present from my son.

989
00:55:42,472 --> 00:55:44,702
- How old is he?
- 7

990
00:55:44,774 --> 00:55:48,972
Shit, ain't nobody in the whole world
7 years old no more.

991
00:55:49,045 --> 00:55:50,239
I'm moving in.

992
00:55:50,313 --> 00:55:53,043
That fat piece of shit over there
keeps farting all night.

993
00:55:53,116 --> 00:55:56,882
About to turn my carjacking beef
into a homicide if I stay over there.

994
00:55:56,953 --> 00:55:59,421
Well, welcome to the neighborhood.

995
00:56:02,726 --> 00:56:07,663
Congratulations, everyone.
We have 3 Pulitzer finalists in our midst.

996
00:56:10,767 --> 00:56:12,291
For investigative reporting.

997
00:56:22,245 --> 00:56:23,769
Yo, Armstrong.

998
00:56:24,748 --> 00:56:27,740
A message for you
from somebody named Bunny.

999
00:56:27,817 --> 00:56:31,150
I just took it for you.
We couldn't find you upstairs.

1000
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:35,490
So you won something, huh?

1001
00:56:36,593 --> 00:56:38,652
I ain't never won nothing.

1002
00:56:39,329 --> 00:56:40,557
- Thanks.
- Sure.

1003
00:56:42,332 --> 00:56:43,822
How was school today?

1004
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,731
- Okay, I guess.
- Yeah?

1005
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:49,599
- What was the best part?
- I don't know.

1006
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:54,774
Hey, I won an award.
Though I almost did.

1007
00:56:55,145 --> 00:56:57,978
A big one, for being a good reporter.

1008
00:56:58,047 --> 00:57:01,676
- That's nice.
- And the first person I wanted to tell

1009
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:05,687
was you 'cause you're my most special guy.

1010
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:13,726
- You want to put your dad back on?
- Okay.

1011
00:57:13,897 --> 00:57:15,194
Okay.

1012
00:57:19,302 --> 00:57:21,361
Hey, he really misses you.

1013
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:26,098
- Really?
- So, the Pulitzer?

1014
00:57:26,176 --> 00:57:29,339
Yeah. You told me, remember?

1015
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:32,341
That's not that...

1016
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:38,743
Everyone to your bunk! Shake down!

1017
00:57:38,988 --> 00:57:41,354
Lock your hands behind your head.

1018
00:57:41,424 --> 00:57:43,483
Come on, Armstrong, let's get to your bunk.

1019
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:46,188
Lock your hands behind your head.
Shake down!

1020
00:57:46,262 --> 00:57:48,162
- Let's go!
- Let's go, ladies!

1021
00:57:48,231 --> 00:57:50,028
I can find your head by your bunks.

1022
00:57:50,099 --> 00:57:51,896
- Move!
- Let's go, ladies! Let's go!

1023
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:54,095
Get to your racks now!

1024
00:57:57,207 --> 00:58:00,870
What is you doing, Miss Jones?
Get to your bunk, now!

1025
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:07,281
You know this is not allowed in here.
It's contraband.

1026
00:58:07,350 --> 00:58:08,544
Sorry.

1027
00:58:09,185 --> 00:58:12,154
You been taking these
from the IK for weeks.

1028
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:18,987
More contraband.

1029
00:58:32,275 --> 00:58:34,675
Hey, that's personal stuff.

1030
00:58:34,744 --> 00:58:37,804
Can I have that back? What the fuck is this?
You can't take that!

1031
00:58:37,881 --> 00:58:39,849
- What did you say?
- She can't take that. It's mine!

1032
00:58:39,916 --> 00:58:41,383
Get back to your bunk!

1033
00:58:41,451 --> 00:58:44,978
You hold that noise, ma'am,
or I will take you to the hole!

1034
00:58:45,054 --> 00:58:46,749
You understand me?

1035
00:58:48,558 --> 00:58:50,992
Lock your hands behind your head.

1036
00:58:54,564 --> 00:58:55,997
Deseg for you.

1037
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:01,829
Fuck.

1038
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:27,159
Well, it's amazing news about
the Pulitzer. Congratulations.

1039
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:29,498
Yeah. No, that's great. I just...

1040
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:33,502
I'm not surprised Tom Williams got it.
His story got the mayor to resign.

1041
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:35,868
The President is so popular,
nobody gave a damn about what I wrote.

1042
00:59:35,939 --> 00:59:38,203
Well, we're all proud of you.

1043
00:59:38,474 --> 00:59:40,305
No, I know. Thanks.

1044
00:59:40,810 --> 00:59:42,334
I'm sorry.

1045
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:46,041
They took my journal, my notes,
for taking an apple out of the chow house.

1046
00:59:46,115 --> 00:59:48,310
I can't write, and it's driving me nuts.

1047
00:59:48,384 --> 00:59:51,012
They took my pen.
I can't even write to Timmy anymore.

1048
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:53,783
I was wondering if you could possibly

1049
00:59:53,856 --> 00:59:56,051
write an editorial or something,
shame them a bit.

1050
00:59:56,125 --> 00:59:58,685
Yeah, of course.
Tomorrow, tomorrow's paper.

1051
00:59:58,761 --> 01:00:00,126
Thank you.

1052
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:02,258
So, look,

1053
01:00:03,299 --> 01:00:05,859
Molly Meyers wants to interview you.

1054
01:00:06,135 --> 01:00:09,298
What? Why? I'm not anorexic.

1055
01:00:09,372 --> 01:00:13,035
I'm not in rehab.
I'm not dating Justin Timberlake.

1056
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:14,804
Human interest, I guess.

1057
01:00:14,877 --> 01:00:18,210
Look, she's a journalist.
She has to be on your side, right?

1058
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:21,011
The top dogs are really pushing for it.

1059
01:00:21,184 --> 01:00:24,347
It's like you said, no one's
writing about your case anymore.

1060
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:26,388
We're losing traction.

1061
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:28,788
The government isn't feeling
the public pressure.

1062
01:00:28,858 --> 01:00:31,224
And the fines and the
legal fees are growing.

1063
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:33,819
- I get it. Say hi to Avril...
- Don't think about that. No. No, no.

1064
01:00:33,896 --> 01:00:38,162
We just need to get you out in front
again, and, for what it's worth,

1065
01:00:38,501 --> 01:00:41,368
Molly Meyers will get the eyeballs on you.

1066
01:00:42,338 --> 01:00:43,737
So?

1067
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:45,671
Okay. But it's gotta be live.

1068
01:00:45,742 --> 01:00:48,609
She's not gonna edit me
into a doddering idiot.

1069
01:00:48,678 --> 01:00:52,045
- Absolutely.
- And I'm not fucking crying, either.

1070
01:00:52,115 --> 01:00:53,207
All right.

1071
01:00:54,617 --> 01:00:56,744
What are you wearing?
What is this, the new Cartier?

1072
01:00:56,819 --> 01:00:58,218
It's a wonderful watch.

1073
01:00:58,287 --> 01:01:01,620
No, it's not a watch. It's jewelry.
Here, look at here.

1074
01:01:01,691 --> 01:01:05,650
I'm suddenly nuts about this de Grisogono.
I love the numerals.

1075
01:01:05,728 --> 01:01:08,196
- All different sizes. Isn't that nice?
- It's a beauty.

1076
01:01:08,264 --> 01:01:11,028
- Ready, Molly.
- All right, have fun.

1077
01:01:13,870 --> 01:01:18,034
Okay. They're telling me
it's gonna be substantive.

1078
01:01:18,107 --> 01:01:19,597
It's gonna be serious.

1079
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:21,803
- Really?
- Well, that's what they're telling me.

1080
01:01:21,878 --> 01:01:25,780
This will be your moment, not hers.
You'll be great.

1081
01:01:26,215 --> 01:01:27,739
Here you go.

1082
01:01:27,817 --> 01:01:31,082
- Rachel, hi. I'm Molly Meyers.
- Right, we met once.

1083
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:34,547
I interviewed with you
to be your research assistant.

1084
01:01:34,624 --> 01:01:36,285
Oh, no kidding.

1085
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:38,384
We are not going to have time for this.

1086
01:01:38,461 --> 01:01:42,363
If you have time for the Identities Act.
Great. If not, so be it.

1087
01:01:42,432 --> 01:01:44,297
- That's fine.
- One minute.

1088
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:48,497
All right. Thank you so much
for doing this, Rachel.

1089
01:01:48,838 --> 01:01:52,296
- And congratulations on the Pulitzer.
- It was just a finalist.

1090
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:56,368
- Well, bravo. We're all with you.
- Thank you, that's very nice.

1091
01:01:56,446 --> 01:01:58,812
Of course, I can't say it on the air.
Objectivity and all that.

1092
01:01:58,915 --> 01:02:00,246
All right, ready?

1093
01:02:00,316 --> 01:02:04,184
- You know we're live?
- Todd is gonna toss it to you in 3, 2...

1094
01:02:05,121 --> 01:02:06,816
Thank you, Todd.

1095
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:09,221
Rachel Armstrong, thank you for joining us.

1096
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:12,459
Rachel, you have been here
for 7 months.

1097
01:02:13,863 --> 01:02:15,990
How are you feeling?

1098
01:02:16,065 --> 01:02:18,260
Well, physically I feel fine.

1099
01:02:19,602 --> 01:02:22,730
I don't get the exercise that I need,
but I feel fine.

1100
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:29,000
You know, I look at you and I get this
sort of, "How do you do it?" sensation.

1101
01:02:29,078 --> 01:02:34,209
Vassar girl, Columbia Journalism,
suburban soccer mom...

1102
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:37,886
How Twilight Zone- ish is this for you?

1103
01:02:37,954 --> 01:02:39,945
I must say, when I wake up in the morning,

1104
01:02:40,022 --> 01:02:42,286
it does take me a few seconds
to realize where I am.

1105
01:02:42,358 --> 01:02:45,919
I mean, I haven't grown accustomed to it.

1106
01:02:47,964 --> 01:02:51,661
You're married to the novelist,
Ray Armstrong.

1107
01:02:52,468 --> 01:02:54,197
How is the marriage holding up?

1108
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:57,637
- Well, obviously, it puts pressure...
- It must be very hard.

1109
01:02:57,707 --> 01:03:00,699
It is hard. But we're strong.

1110
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:05,976
You know, he's very supportive of me,
and we're best friends. That really helps.

1111
01:03:07,350 --> 01:03:10,581
And what about your son? Timothy.

1112
01:03:12,421 --> 01:03:14,548
When was the last time you saw him?

1113
01:03:16,259 --> 01:03:18,227
It's been a long time.

1114
01:03:19,896 --> 01:03:21,090
How long?

1115
01:03:25,735 --> 01:03:28,329
He came to see me
when I was first brought here,

1116
01:03:29,539 --> 01:03:32,906
but I have asked that
he not visit me in this place.

1117
01:03:34,877 --> 01:03:36,606
Well, that must be brutal.

1118
01:03:36,679 --> 01:03:40,877
Most mothers, though, are going
to have a hard time understanding.

1119
01:03:40,950 --> 01:03:43,043
I guess I would have, too,

1120
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:46,513
but most mothers would have
no idea what they would do

1121
01:03:46,589 --> 01:03:49,285
unless they were in my position.

1122
01:03:52,428 --> 01:03:56,125
The truth is, bringing
Timmy here would be selfish.

1123
01:03:56,465 --> 01:03:58,592
You know, it would be for me.

1124
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:07,966
And I do wonder a lot if I can survive
another day not seeing him,

1125
01:04:08,044 --> 01:04:10,842
but I know Timmy,

1126
01:04:12,748 --> 01:04:16,650
and I saw the look in his eyes
when he was brought here,

1127
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:22,047
and I know the damage that it would do

1128
01:04:22,124 --> 01:04:26,060
to see his mother in this place, caged up.

1129
01:04:26,128 --> 01:04:28,562
So, you know, I can't do that to him.

1130
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:35,137
Rachel, let's get to the meat of it,
because I have to try.

1131
01:04:35,738 --> 01:04:41,370
On your story, on uncovering the identity
of the CIA agent Erica Van Doren,

1132
01:04:41,444 --> 01:04:43,378
who was your source?

1133
01:04:44,914 --> 01:04:48,509
Well, Molly, let me ask you.
Why do you have to try?

1134
01:04:48,584 --> 01:04:51,815
Try to get a fellow journalist
to betray her integrity?

1135
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:55,255
I know you know better than that.
I know you do.

1136
01:04:55,324 --> 01:04:58,384
Before the cameras rolled, you said
you were, quote- unquote, with me.

1137
01:04:58,527 --> 01:05:01,291
Look, I have empathy.
Like you, I would never give up a source.

1138
01:05:01,364 --> 01:05:03,525
But you know what?
Sometimes sources have motives.

1139
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:04,861
Right, okay.

1140
01:05:04,934 --> 01:05:08,131
If the information
they're giving is valuable and truthful,

1141
01:05:08,204 --> 01:05:12,664
like with Watergate or the Pentagon Papers,
then their motives really don't matter.

1142
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:16,269
Any real journalist would be prepared
to put up with the discomfort of jail

1143
01:05:16,345 --> 01:05:18,973
to protect their principle.

1144
01:05:19,048 --> 01:05:21,710
I know you say
you would protect your source,

1145
01:05:21,784 --> 01:05:25,185
as if you're saying,
"There but for the grace of God go I,"

1146
01:05:26,055 --> 01:05:28,216
and you're never gonna have to worry about

1147
01:05:28,291 --> 01:05:31,419
- the government coming after you.
- Why?

1148
01:05:31,627 --> 01:05:33,652
Because the government really doesn't care

1149
01:05:33,729 --> 01:05:35,890
how you found out
where Paris had dinner last night.

1150
01:05:38,834 --> 01:05:41,769
That's my bunkie right there, y'all.
That's my bunkie!

1151
01:06:03,492 --> 01:06:04,982
Ray.

1152
01:06:05,061 --> 01:06:07,996
Hey. Hey, Albert. Hey.

1153
01:06:08,864 --> 01:06:11,594
Hi, I'm Albert Burnside.

1154
01:06:11,667 --> 01:06:14,135
- Hi, I'm Gretchen Monroy.
- Hi.

1155
01:06:15,304 --> 01:06:18,796
- So, did you see the Molly Meyers thing?
- Yes. Yes.

1156
01:06:18,874 --> 01:06:22,742
- Rachel was real terrific. It was great.
- Yeah, she was unbelievable.

1157
01:06:24,747 --> 01:06:26,942
- I'll catch up with you.
- Sure.

1158
01:06:27,016 --> 01:06:29,041
Nice to meet you.

1159
01:06:32,722 --> 01:06:34,280
- Look, Albert.
- It's none of my business.

1160
01:06:34,357 --> 01:06:35,688
No, no, no. No, you don't.

1161
01:06:35,791 --> 01:06:37,725
There are things about us
that you just don't...

1162
01:06:37,793 --> 01:06:41,422
- When you say "us"?
- Rachel and me.

1163
01:06:43,699 --> 01:06:46,827
Look, Ray, if you can sleep at night,
you can sleep at night.

1164
01:06:49,205 --> 01:06:50,934
She made a choice.

1165
01:06:52,641 --> 01:06:55,667
- Choices have consequences.
- Yeah, if you think your wife

1166
01:06:56,078 --> 01:07:00,606
felt like she had a choice in this,
then maybe you 2 shouldn't be together.

1167
01:07:02,218 --> 01:07:06,712
Well, you can tell her or not.
That's entirely up to you.

1168
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:09,924
Keep up the good work.

1169
01:07:28,511 --> 01:07:31,571
Excuse me, ma'am. Excuse me.
Didn't mean to startle you.

1170
01:07:31,647 --> 01:07:35,242
- That's okay.
- I'm looking for the Stein residence.

1171
01:07:35,317 --> 01:07:36,944
Stein residence?

1172
01:07:39,989 --> 01:07:43,925
You know, I don't know.
I don't think there is a Stein on the block.

1173
01:07:43,993 --> 01:07:45,824
Harv and Sheila?

1174
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:47,920
Harv and Sheila...

1175
01:07:49,331 --> 01:07:50,730
Oh, God.

1176
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:24,293
Rachel?

1177
01:08:26,469 --> 01:08:28,960
Who do you have working the story?

1178
01:08:29,171 --> 01:08:31,503
Evans and Merkow.

1179
01:08:31,574 --> 01:08:34,441
The shooter belonged
to a right wing fringe group.

1180
01:08:34,510 --> 01:08:38,173
I guess he thought Erica had it in
for our beloved President.

1181
01:08:38,247 --> 01:08:42,274
Name's Alan Murphy. He's nuts and stupid.

1182
01:08:42,351 --> 01:08:45,946
Drove his own car to the murder site,
then crashed it half a mile away.

1183
01:08:47,223 --> 01:08:51,455
Once she resigned from the CIA,
she lost her protective detail.

1184
01:08:51,527 --> 01:08:53,392
God, this is so crazy.

1185
01:08:55,097 --> 01:08:59,295
Evans and Merkow will want to get
a statement from you of some kind.

1186
01:09:04,373 --> 01:09:07,501
I know. I get it. It's okay.

1187
01:09:08,344 --> 01:09:09,641
It's okay.

1188
01:09:12,848 --> 01:09:15,840
- How's Allison doing?
- Who is Allison?

1189
01:09:17,019 --> 01:09:18,646
Erica's daughter.

1190
01:09:20,823 --> 01:09:23,189
- Bonnie...
- It is not your fault.

1191
01:09:28,197 --> 01:09:30,290
Am I doing the right thing?

1192
01:09:34,236 --> 01:09:37,467
What's the problem?
We still have 15 minutes.

1193
01:09:37,540 --> 01:09:40,576
Judge wants to see her.
I've got a van waiting.

1194
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:01,561
The President now seems to feel
compelled to get involved personally.

1195
01:10:02,798 --> 01:10:05,892
He wants to get
to the bottom of this debacle.

1196
01:10:08,470 --> 01:10:13,669
What happened is terrible,
and my heart goes out to her little girl,

1197
01:10:13,776 --> 01:10:17,542
- but it hasn't changed my position.
- Okay, that's not what I need.

1198
01:10:17,613 --> 01:10:20,912
I have here copies of waivers

1199
01:10:21,717 --> 01:10:27,485
that have been signed
by all White House staff and senior CIA.

1200
01:10:28,357 --> 01:10:31,520
It authorizes you, gives you permission

1201
01:10:31,594 --> 01:10:35,189
to reveal their names
if they were your source.

1202
01:10:36,665 --> 01:10:38,565
It's a blanket waiver.

1203
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:41,927
That should do it for you.

1204
01:10:42,371 --> 01:10:44,498
Have a look. See if your source has signed.

1205
01:10:44,573 --> 01:10:47,906
- These people were obviously coerced.
- These people here?

1206
01:10:47,977 --> 01:10:50,343
These people have signed
of their own volition.

1207
01:10:50,412 --> 01:10:54,348
Yeah, if you don't sign these,
then we'll harass you,

1208
01:10:54,416 --> 01:10:58,147
we'll investigate you,
we'll make your life hell on earth.

1209
01:11:00,589 --> 01:11:03,422
I'm not even going to look at them, Judge.

1210
01:11:10,399 --> 01:11:12,799
- Anybody want some tea?
- Yes, please.

1211
01:11:12,868 --> 01:11:15,166
- No, thank you.
- It's from Greece.

1212
01:11:22,378 --> 01:11:24,938
What are we going to do with you?

1213
01:11:25,014 --> 01:11:29,781
This has gotten to the point now
where my wife is pissed off at me

1214
01:11:30,219 --> 01:11:33,211
and is telling me that I'm some sort of bully.

1215
01:11:34,490 --> 01:11:37,323
Well, you're not gonna get
much sympathy from me there.

1216
01:11:37,393 --> 01:11:41,352
Your Honor, can I borrow
your library for a second?

1217
01:11:47,836 --> 01:11:50,532
You think I should look at the waivers.

1218
01:11:58,914 --> 01:12:02,714
A man can live a good life,
be honorable, give to charity,

1219
01:12:05,087 --> 01:12:08,079
but in the end, the number of people
who come to his funeral

1220
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:10,819
is generally dependent on the weather.

1221
01:12:14,930 --> 01:12:17,160
What? I'm sorry. I'm not following.

1222
01:12:17,232 --> 01:12:22,534
The weather has changed, Rachel.
I'm sorry, but it has. That's the truth.

1223
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:28,271
In the old days, this would
have been a lot easier to fight.

1224
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:30,175
The public would have called you a hero.

1225
01:12:30,245 --> 01:12:33,806
But I don't know,
somewhere along the line, the press...

1226
01:12:33,916 --> 01:12:37,784
The press stopped being the white knight,
and started being the dragon.

1227
01:12:37,853 --> 01:12:39,480
That's the way people see it.

1228
01:12:39,555 --> 01:12:43,821
You want to know why no paper
in this country, including your own,

1229
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:47,124
has continued covering your story?

1230
01:12:48,263 --> 01:12:49,924
Why don't you tell me?

1231
01:12:49,998 --> 01:12:54,367
Because your 48- hour news cycle
dried up months ago.

1232
01:12:55,771 --> 01:12:58,365
I mean, look at you, Rachel.
You look like shit.

1233
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:01,671
- Your kid is growing up without you...
- Don't bring Timmy into this.

1234
01:13:01,744 --> 01:13:04,975
- It's not fair. Okay. I'm a good mother.
- Fair? Fuck fair!

1235
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:07,208
Look, you may not want
to bring your son into this,

1236
01:13:07,282 --> 01:13:09,546
- but I do. You want to know why?
- Why?

1237
01:13:09,618 --> 01:13:13,520
Because I'm defending Rachel Armstrong,
not a principle.

1238
01:13:19,495 --> 01:13:24,023
A man leaves his family to go to jail
to protect a principle,

1239
01:13:24,099 --> 01:13:26,932
and they name a holiday after him.

1240
01:13:27,002 --> 01:13:30,028
A man leaves his children
to go fight in a war,

1241
01:13:30,105 --> 01:13:32,539
and they erect a monument to him.

1242
01:13:32,608 --> 01:13:36,203
A woman does the same thing,
and she's the monster.

1243
01:13:37,212 --> 01:13:39,612
If we back down,
what are we saying, Albert?

1244
01:13:39,681 --> 01:13:44,084
"Trust reporters as long as they're
not mothers, because they'll crack. "

1245
01:13:44,620 --> 01:13:48,784
The truth is, if I had known that
writing this fucking story

1246
01:13:48,857 --> 01:13:52,759
would have separated me from Timmy,
then maybe I wouldn't have done it.

1247
01:13:52,861 --> 01:13:55,921
But here we are. The story's been published,

1248
01:13:55,998 --> 01:13:59,434
and the path has been chosen,
and there's no way back,

1249
01:13:59,501 --> 01:14:02,959
and in the end, my son will be fine.

1250
01:14:03,038 --> 01:14:06,735
You know, Ray is a great father,
and Timmy's gonna be okay,

1251
01:14:08,377 --> 01:14:11,175
but that will not be the case with my source.

1252
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:15,842
My source will be publicly saddled
with the death of Erica Van Doren,

1253
01:14:15,918 --> 01:14:17,078
and that, I promise you,

1254
01:14:17,152 --> 01:14:19,245
will mean the destruction
of the person we're talking about,

1255
01:14:19,321 --> 01:14:21,812
and that, Albert, that is not fair.

1256
01:14:23,125 --> 01:14:24,183
Why?

1257
01:14:25,494 --> 01:14:31,126
I mean, your source knew full well
the ramifications of speaking to you.

1258
01:14:34,369 --> 01:14:38,897
My source didn't know what they were doing

1259
01:14:38,974 --> 01:14:41,169
when I got the information.

1260
01:14:42,978 --> 01:14:47,938
- Was he drunk? Was he talking in his sleep?
- Hey, take a fucking walk.

1261
01:14:48,016 --> 01:14:50,416
We're trying to swim
a fucking waterfall here, Albert.

1262
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:52,920
We have a responsibility to the
shareholders not to go bankrupt.

1263
01:14:52,988 --> 01:14:55,889
If you're so worried about that,
then I'll go pro bono from here on in.

1264
01:14:55,958 --> 01:14:58,586
- How about that?
- Sold.

1265
01:15:00,262 --> 01:15:01,661
Come in.

1266
01:15:01,997 --> 01:15:06,229
Okay. I just got off the phone.

1267
01:15:07,970 --> 01:15:11,371
Stan Riggens has agreed
to speak to the grand jury.

1268
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:14,637
I guess signing that waiver spooked him.

1269
01:15:14,710 --> 01:15:15,802
Stan?

1270
01:15:17,646 --> 01:15:21,207
- I owe that kid in my office 10 bucks.
- When is all this supposed to happen?

1271
01:15:21,283 --> 01:15:24,946
As soon as possible. It'll have to
wait until tomorrow morning.

1272
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:28,148
Once he confirms he was your source,
you're off the hook.

1273
01:15:28,223 --> 01:15:30,282
Pack your bags, Rachel.

1274
01:15:33,829 --> 01:15:36,889
You were chief of staff to the Vice President.

1275
01:15:36,965 --> 01:15:39,559
I resigned 11 months ago.

1276
01:15:39,635 --> 01:15:43,196
And were you the
source of information provided

1277
01:15:43,305 --> 01:15:47,264
on the October 6th edition
of the Capital Sun Times

1278
01:15:47,376 --> 01:15:51,904
in which the identity of the covert
CIA agent was revealed?

1279
01:15:52,781 --> 01:15:54,442
I was.

1280
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:58,452
Can you tell us all how that came about?

1281
01:15:59,354 --> 01:16:04,849
Well, I guess I was just so angry
at Erica Van Doren and her husband,

1282
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:09,294
- my emotions got the better of me.
- I'm not interested in your motivations.

1283
01:16:09,364 --> 01:16:12,993
I want to know how
you came to reveal this information.

1284
01:16:14,436 --> 01:16:15,767
I was at a party.

1285
01:16:15,837 --> 01:16:16,861
...you guys, it's muddy right here.

1286
01:16:16,939 --> 01:16:18,702
I had been drinking.

1287
01:16:23,645 --> 01:16:25,135
Stan.

1288
01:16:26,648 --> 01:16:29,549
Hello there, young- ish lady. How are you?

1289
01:16:29,618 --> 01:16:33,679
Can I get a beer, please? Good. Great.
Just here with my son.

1290
01:16:33,755 --> 01:16:37,919
They're cute now, but they
grow up. You know?

1291
01:16:37,993 --> 01:16:39,051
So I've been reading.

1292
01:16:39,928 --> 01:16:42,897
So I heard Glen invited you.
It's good to see you.

1293
01:16:42,965 --> 01:16:47,163
Yeah, and you thought,
"Well, how can I pass up this opportunity?"

1294
01:16:47,235 --> 01:16:49,726
That is exactly what I thought.

1295
01:16:53,342 --> 01:16:56,311
- Can I ask you a question?
- Anything.

1296
01:16:56,378 --> 01:16:57,640
Ambassador Van Doren.

1297
01:16:57,713 --> 01:16:59,840
- What about him?
- His wife.

1298
01:16:59,915 --> 01:17:01,940
Is she a spook, Stan?

1299
01:17:06,221 --> 01:17:07,586
Come here.

1300
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:16,054
- Now, look, you did not hear this from me.
- Of course not.

1301
01:17:16,131 --> 01:17:18,031
- Not from me.
- Absolutely not.

1302
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:22,332
But, everybody knows she's at the CIA.
Everybody.

1303
01:17:23,405 --> 01:17:24,736
But you can't use that.

1304
01:17:24,806 --> 01:17:28,799
Hey, I won't say it came from you,
but we're not off the record.

1305
01:17:30,846 --> 01:17:32,507
Screw it.

1306
01:17:32,581 --> 01:17:35,345
Everybody knows anyway.
Common knowledge.

1307
01:17:36,385 --> 01:17:39,115
Do you know if she happened
to get out to Venezuela at all?

1308
01:17:39,187 --> 01:17:40,677
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1309
01:17:41,523 --> 01:17:47,086
She came to you and asked you
if Ms. Van Doren was a spy?

1310
01:17:49,164 --> 01:17:51,098
She already knew.

1311
01:17:51,533 --> 01:17:53,023
That's right.

1312
01:17:53,602 --> 01:17:55,365
They're not satisfied with Riggens.

1313
01:17:55,437 --> 01:17:57,632
He was just your corroborative source.

1314
01:17:57,706 --> 01:18:00,402
So was the FBl guy
who gave you her report.

1315
01:18:01,309 --> 01:18:04,904
They still want the original source,
which puts us back at square one.

1316
01:18:05,013 --> 01:18:07,447
Well, how much longer can this go on?

1317
01:18:08,050 --> 01:18:12,180
It's 7 months or so before the
grand jury is required to disband,

1318
01:18:12,254 --> 01:18:14,722
and then Dubois
can just order up a new one.

1319
01:18:14,790 --> 01:18:16,121
I can't...

1320
01:18:29,871 --> 01:18:32,965
I'm gonna have to tell the Warden I did this.

1321
01:18:34,676 --> 01:18:35,870
Look,

1322
01:18:42,317 --> 01:18:44,444
if you're gonna be here another 7 months,

1323
01:18:44,519 --> 01:18:48,148
then you should know, in every way

1324
01:18:50,092 --> 01:18:52,394
how this will affect you.

1325
01:20:04,499 --> 01:20:06,023
Albert told me.

1326
01:20:13,208 --> 01:20:16,177
Well, do I get any details?

1327
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:20,809
Details? Yeah.

1328
01:20:23,285 --> 01:20:25,879
The details are you're in here,

1329
01:20:26,855 --> 01:20:28,584
and whatever it is keeping you in here

1330
01:20:28,657 --> 01:20:32,058
is more important to you
than what's on the outside.

1331
01:20:35,397 --> 01:20:39,128
- Well, how long have you been seeing her?
- Just a few weeks.

1332
01:20:40,569 --> 01:20:42,935
- Do you love her?
- I don't know.

1333
01:20:43,004 --> 01:20:44,494
You don't know?

1334
01:20:44,573 --> 01:20:47,770
It's only been a few weeks.
You don't know her.

1335
01:20:48,910 --> 01:20:51,572
- What do you do with Timmy?
- What?

1336
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:55,343
When you're fucking her,
what do you do with Timmy?

1337
01:20:55,417 --> 01:20:58,545
He's with a sitter when we go out.

1338
01:20:58,620 --> 01:21:01,248
- Has he met her?
- No.

1339
01:21:01,323 --> 01:21:04,815
- Do I know her?
- You don't know her. I told you that.

1340
01:21:05,861 --> 01:21:07,158
- She lives in Maryland...
- Okay. You know what,

1341
01:21:07,229 --> 01:21:09,424
- I don't want to hear any more.
- Look...

1342
01:21:09,497 --> 01:21:13,433
Ray, I know this is impossible for all of us.

1343
01:21:13,735 --> 01:21:16,329
I get it. You're lonely. I'm lonely.

1344
01:21:18,673 --> 01:21:20,072
Look, all you have to do to keep me,

1345
01:21:20,141 --> 01:21:24,237
to keep my respect,
is just tell me it means nothing.

1346
01:21:24,312 --> 01:21:28,271
That you love me, and that...

1347
01:21:42,764 --> 01:21:45,130
I'd like to see Timmy now.

1348
01:21:46,635 --> 01:21:49,798
Something you should know is
I speak only the best about you to him.

1349
01:21:49,871 --> 01:21:54,035
All right, don't patronize me. Okay?
I need to see him, and he needs to see me.

1350
01:21:55,176 --> 01:21:57,906
- That's it.
- Okay. Okay.

1351
01:21:57,979 --> 01:21:59,810
I'll see what we can do.

1352
01:21:59,881 --> 01:22:02,349
They don't allow visitation
on weekends anymore,

1353
01:22:02,417 --> 01:22:05,944
and his school routine is pretty locked in.

1354
01:22:06,121 --> 01:22:07,554
So, now, on top of everything else,

1355
01:22:07,622 --> 01:22:09,021
you're gonna try and keep my son from me?

1356
01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:11,957
- No. No, it's not like that.
- Isn't like what, Ray?

1357
01:22:12,027 --> 01:22:13,460
It's not like you're cheating on your wife

1358
01:22:13,528 --> 01:22:15,359
- while she is fucking rotting in jail?
- Keep your voice down.

1359
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:17,022
- Rache.
- Is that what it's not like?

1360
01:22:17,098 --> 01:22:18,429
- Fuck you!
- Hey! Hey!

1361
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:21,333
- Fuck off!
- Okay, okay, okay.

1362
01:22:24,839 --> 01:22:26,670
Go to hell!

1363
01:22:26,741 --> 01:22:28,208
It's okay.

1364
01:22:28,276 --> 01:22:30,608
Really, this is how you want...

1365
01:22:32,013 --> 01:22:35,881
You know what? Thanks for the fuck, Ray!
That really hit the spot!

1366
01:22:37,686 --> 01:22:41,952
Right, 'cause you're the only one
who got fucked by all this. Right?

1367
01:23:01,943 --> 01:23:03,877
Hey.

1368
01:23:03,945 --> 01:23:06,004
What the fuck is your problem?

1369
01:23:06,081 --> 01:23:09,676
- You're in my bunk.
- Get a new fucking bunk.

1370
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:14,914
- Hey. That's my stuff! Stop it!
- Yeah. It's going down here!

1371
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:18,050
- Hey!
- Get your skanky ass stuff out of my bunk!

1372
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:21,492
- Go get a new bunk!
- Get your ass out of my fucking bunk.

1373
01:23:21,563 --> 01:23:23,588
This is not your bunk!

1374
01:23:23,665 --> 01:23:24,791
That ain't right.

1375
01:23:24,866 --> 01:23:28,461
You want the bunk? Your bunk?
You want that bunk? Huh?

1376
01:23:28,570 --> 01:23:29,901
You want that bunk?

1377
01:23:39,814 --> 01:23:41,941
You want your fucking bunk now, huh?

1378
01:23:43,918 --> 01:23:45,180
Yeah.

1379
01:23:55,430 --> 01:23:57,523
Come on, leave her alone.

1380
01:24:01,636 --> 01:24:03,126
Get down! Get down! Get down!

1381
01:24:13,214 --> 01:24:14,408
Oh, God.

1382
01:24:17,519 --> 01:24:19,009
What happened?

1383
01:24:20,622 --> 01:24:23,591
I got the shit kicked out of me, Albert.
That's what happened.

1384
01:24:23,658 --> 01:24:25,455
How? What? Over what?

1385
01:24:26,661 --> 01:24:29,858
- We both wanted the top bunk.
- What?

1386
01:24:31,433 --> 01:24:35,267
Well, you've always known
the important things to fight for.

1387
01:24:40,942 --> 01:24:43,308
Are the doctors saying
you're gonna be all right?

1388
01:24:43,378 --> 01:24:45,403
Yeah. Whatever that means.

1389
01:24:51,586 --> 01:24:57,422
You know, I'm the most
senior prisoner in this jail.

1390
01:24:58,326 --> 01:25:01,727
I've had 32 different bunk mates
since I've been here.

1391
01:25:03,131 --> 01:25:05,531
I gotta say, that's a record.

1392
01:25:11,072 --> 01:25:12,733
Is that a new tie?

1393
01:25:13,108 --> 01:25:17,238
No, I've had it a while. Domenico Vacca.

1394
01:25:17,912 --> 01:25:21,279
- I took you for a Kenneth Cole man.
- Kenneth Cole?

1395
01:25:23,084 --> 01:25:26,144
Well, I'm glad you retained
your sense of humor.

1396
01:25:30,558 --> 01:25:33,823
You look like a woman
who could use some good news.

1397
01:25:35,497 --> 01:25:37,124
It's great news.

1398
01:25:41,669 --> 01:25:44,103
They've agreed.
They're going to take your case.

1399
01:25:44,172 --> 01:25:46,741
It's gonna be an expedited hearing.

1400
01:25:52,881 --> 01:25:55,850
The next case this morning
is in re Armstrong.

1401
01:25:55,917 --> 01:25:58,647
We'll hear first from Mr. Burnside.

1402
01:26:01,422 --> 01:26:04,687
Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the court.

1403
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:08,527
In 1972 in Branzburg V. Hayes,

1404
01:26:08,596 --> 01:26:13,090
this court ruled
against the right of reporters

1405
01:26:13,168 --> 01:26:16,831
to withhold the names of their sources
before a grand jury,

1406
01:26:17,505 --> 01:26:21,464
and it gave the power to the government

1407
01:26:21,576 --> 01:26:24,374
to imprison those reporters who did.

1408
01:26:25,046 --> 01:26:27,742
It was a 5-4decision. Close.

1409
01:26:29,751 --> 01:26:32,811
In his dissent in Branzburg,
Justice Stewart said,

1410
01:26:32,887 --> 01:26:35,583
"As the years pass,

1411
01:26:35,657 --> 01:26:39,218
"the power of government
becomes more and more pervasive. "

1412
01:26:39,460 --> 01:26:43,556
"Those in power," he said,
"whatever their politics,

1413
01:26:43,631 --> 01:26:45,758
"want only to perpetuate it

1414
01:26:47,535 --> 01:26:50,163
"and the people are the victims. "

1415
01:26:50,271 --> 01:26:54,799
Well, the years have passed,
and that power is pervasive.

1416
01:26:56,444 --> 01:27:00,107
Ms. Armstrong could have buckled
to the demands of the government.

1417
01:27:00,248 --> 01:27:02,876
She could have abandoned
her promise of confidentiality.

1418
01:27:02,951 --> 01:27:06,443
She could have simply
gone home to her family.

1419
01:27:06,688 --> 01:27:08,451
But to do so

1420
01:27:09,657 --> 01:27:12,626
would mean that no source
would ever speak to her again,

1421
01:27:12,694 --> 01:27:16,494
and no source would ever speak
to her newspaper again,

1422
01:27:16,564 --> 01:27:20,796
and then tomorrow when we lock up
journalists from other newspapers,

1423
01:27:22,003 --> 01:27:25,200
we'll make those publications
irrelevant as well,

1424
01:27:27,275 --> 01:27:30,676
and thus we'll make the
1st Amendment irrelevant.

1425
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:36,740
And then how will we know
if a president has covered up crimes?

1426
01:27:36,818 --> 01:27:40,879
Or if an army officer has condoned torture?

1427
01:27:42,857 --> 01:27:47,419
We, as a nation, will no longer be able
to hold those in power accountable

1428
01:27:48,563 --> 01:27:50,895
to those whom they have power over.

1429
01:27:52,300 --> 01:27:56,327
And what then is the nature of government

1430
01:27:56,404 --> 01:27:59,032
when it has no fear of accountability?

1431
01:28:01,376 --> 01:28:03,776
We should shudder at the thought.

1432
01:28:05,413 --> 01:28:08,780
Imprisoning journalists?
That's for other countries.

1433
01:28:10,818 --> 01:28:13,946
That's for countries who fear their citizens,

1434
01:28:15,857 --> 01:28:19,054
not countries that cherish and protect them.

1435
01:28:22,230 --> 01:28:23,857
Some time ago,

1436
01:28:23,931 --> 01:28:30,734
I began to feel the personal
human pressure on Rachel Armstrong,

1437
01:28:33,007 --> 01:28:38,912
and I told her that I was there
to represent her and not a principle.

1438
01:28:45,053 --> 01:28:50,047
And it was not until I met her
that I realized that with great people,

1439
01:28:53,194 --> 01:28:56,721
there's no difference
between principle and the person.

1440
01:29:12,313 --> 01:29:14,645
Come on. I got new digs for you.

1441
01:29:17,752 --> 01:29:21,313
- You know, they brought him out here...
- It's nothing.

1442
01:29:21,389 --> 01:29:22,686
He's not a real person here.

1443
01:29:22,757 --> 01:29:25,191
- Soccer isn't a real thing here.
- They don't respond to it the same way.

1444
01:29:25,259 --> 01:29:28,228
- Judge, good afternoon.
- It's just not.

1445
01:29:28,396 --> 01:29:31,058
Good afternoon, thanks for coming over.

1446
01:29:31,132 --> 01:29:32,724
Mr. Burnside.

1447
01:29:33,735 --> 01:29:37,102
We're talking about soccer not law.
Just want you to know.

1448
01:29:37,171 --> 01:29:40,072
Look, the reason I asked
the 2 of you to come over here today

1449
01:29:40,141 --> 01:29:43,508
is that the Supremes
have decided your case.

1450
01:29:44,011 --> 01:29:46,070
The ruling will be down on Monday,

1451
01:29:46,180 --> 01:29:50,617
but I've been told by a
confidential source what it is,

1452
01:29:50,718 --> 01:29:53,551
and I wanted to share it with you.

1453
01:29:53,621 --> 01:29:56,647
5-4, opinion against you, Albert.

1454
01:29:57,125 --> 01:30:00,891
Same as before.
National security, 1st Amendment,

1455
01:30:01,562 --> 01:30:03,928
the court went with national security.

1456
01:30:05,166 --> 01:30:08,693
And I want to say to you, Patton,
congratulations. You did a great job.

1457
01:30:08,770 --> 01:30:10,738
The court once again

1458
01:30:10,805 --> 01:30:15,868
has made clear that in a case
where journalists are not cooperative,

1459
01:30:15,943 --> 01:30:17,911
they may have to be incarcerated.

1460
01:30:17,979 --> 01:30:19,742
Well, thank you, sir.

1461
01:30:21,048 --> 01:30:22,913
That having been said,

1462
01:30:24,051 --> 01:30:26,246
I've decided to let her go.

1463
01:30:30,491 --> 01:30:33,221
I'm sorry, sir. What?

1464
01:30:33,294 --> 01:30:37,162
I've gotta let her go.
I've been doing this a lot of years now,

1465
01:30:37,231 --> 01:30:42,066
and I am sure that this woman
is not going to reveal her source.

1466
01:30:42,603 --> 01:30:45,299
She's been locked up for almost a year.

1467
01:30:45,373 --> 01:30:48,035
She has been beaten
within an inch of her life.

1468
01:30:48,109 --> 01:30:52,443
- She is resolute.
- That's exactly right. Exactly right.

1469
01:30:52,513 --> 01:30:57,075
I can only keep her in jail if I think doing so
will get her to reveal her source.

1470
01:30:57,151 --> 01:31:01,349
She's not going to talk.
I really have no choice but to let her go.

1471
01:31:01,422 --> 01:31:03,356
If I may. This is a...

1472
01:31:03,424 --> 01:31:07,087
This is a woman
who's been protecting a criminal.

1473
01:31:07,161 --> 01:31:11,461
- That makes her a criminal.
- Oh, come on. She's not a criminal,

1474
01:31:12,099 --> 01:31:13,589
and she won't be a criminal

1475
01:31:13,668 --> 01:31:17,934
unless she is duly charged
and duly convicted by a jury,

1476
01:31:18,539 --> 01:31:20,507
and that's not my call.

1477
01:31:21,309 --> 01:31:23,038
When are you gonna sign
the paperwork, Your Honor?

1478
01:31:23,110 --> 01:31:24,600
I want to get her out of there right away.

1479
01:31:24,679 --> 01:31:25,907
I'm gonna go to court Monday morning.

1480
01:31:25,980 --> 01:31:28,744
I'm gonna announce that I'm freeing her.

1481
01:31:29,617 --> 01:31:31,778
And, Patton, you got a choice.
You can beat me to the punch.

1482
01:31:31,853 --> 01:31:34,151
Just dissolve the grand jury.

1483
01:31:36,457 --> 01:31:38,823
As I'm sure your attorney has informed you,

1484
01:31:38,893 --> 01:31:40,861
the grand jury has been disbanded.

1485
01:31:41,662 --> 01:31:43,653
We're gonna have to wait
till midnight to let you go.

1486
01:31:43,731 --> 01:31:45,631
Midnight?

1487
01:31:45,700 --> 01:31:49,500
What? You're keeping the reporters
away from your losing cause?

1488
01:31:49,904 --> 01:31:52,372
Rachel, I know almost all of it.

1489
01:31:54,342 --> 01:31:58,369
I am indicting 2 government
officials for talking to you.

1490
01:31:58,446 --> 01:32:01,779
I wish I knew who it was
that first tipped you off,

1491
01:32:02,250 --> 01:32:04,582
but I'm not gonna get greedy.

1492
01:32:08,089 --> 01:32:10,284
I'm losing custody of my kid.

1493
01:32:13,327 --> 01:32:15,192
You want the wedding ring?

1494
01:32:15,630 --> 01:32:17,257
Kind of a trophy.

1495
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:22,628
You know, vilify me if you want, Rachel,

1496
01:32:22,703 --> 01:32:28,005
but I had a job to do, and I had
every right to do what I did.

1497
01:32:28,075 --> 01:32:32,136
I think you're confusing your rights
with your power, Mr. Dubois.

1498
01:32:45,693 --> 01:32:47,058
It's okay.

1499
01:32:51,599 --> 01:32:53,658
We booked you a room at the Mayflower,

1500
01:32:53,734 --> 01:32:57,033
but you know you're welcome
to stay with me as long as you need.

1501
01:32:57,104 --> 01:33:00,540
- Thank you. Thanks.
- Sure.

1502
01:33:01,609 --> 01:33:03,372
I spoke to Ray.

1503
01:33:03,477 --> 01:33:05,536
He's gonna bring Timmy by
first thing in the morning.

1504
01:33:05,613 --> 01:33:08,480
Thought maybe you would
like to take him to school?

1505
01:33:08,549 --> 01:33:09,811
Yeah.

1506
01:33:12,587 --> 01:33:15,021
- That's okay?
- Yeah.

1507
01:33:15,957 --> 01:33:17,754
That'd be amazing.

1508
01:33:17,825 --> 01:33:20,020
God, I'm gonna scare him to death, though.

1509
01:33:23,297 --> 01:33:28,064
And, well, you let me know what
you want to do in terms of work.

1510
01:33:28,135 --> 01:33:29,432
You can if you want to.

1511
01:33:29,503 --> 01:33:32,768
No one's going to pressure you
about writing about your experiences.

1512
01:33:36,010 --> 01:33:37,307
Oh, please.

1513
01:33:37,378 --> 01:33:38,436
Rachel, look in the glove,

1514
01:33:38,512 --> 01:33:41,879
hand me the insurance and registration,
would you?

1515
01:33:41,949 --> 01:33:44,076
I was only going 30.

1516
01:33:55,930 --> 01:33:57,727
Ma'am, would you please
step outside of the car?

1517
01:33:57,798 --> 01:34:00,266
- What's going on?
- We just need you to step out.

1518
01:34:00,334 --> 01:34:01,858
Not you, ma'am.

1519
01:34:02,970 --> 01:34:04,870
- Are you kidding me?
- Get out of the car, Rachel.

1520
01:34:04,939 --> 01:34:07,567
- What's the problem, sir?
- I can't believe this.

1521
01:34:07,642 --> 01:34:09,735
- What do you want?
- I'm gonna ask you to turn around, please.

1522
01:34:09,810 --> 01:34:13,337
- What is it? What are you doing?
- Hey, hey! Go easy on her.

1523
01:34:14,115 --> 01:34:15,980
Rachel, I'm sorry that it's come to this.

1524
01:34:16,050 --> 01:34:17,813
- What is going on?
- Back in the car, ma'am.

1525
01:34:17,952 --> 01:34:19,214
Rachel, you're being charged with...

1526
01:34:19,286 --> 01:34:21,186
- What's going on here?
- They're arresting me, Bonnie.

1527
01:34:21,255 --> 01:34:23,018
You're being charged
with criminal contempt of court.

1528
01:34:23,090 --> 01:34:24,250
What does that mean?

1529
01:34:24,325 --> 01:34:28,853
Well, it means you have obstructed justice,
and you're going on trial.

1530
01:34:28,929 --> 01:34:32,296
- Come on. Let's go.
- Hasn't she been through enough?

1531
01:34:34,669 --> 01:34:36,660
God damn it.

1532
01:34:41,809 --> 01:34:44,141
Oh, no. God.

1533
01:34:44,311 --> 01:34:46,677
Dubois! Dubois!

1534
01:34:48,849 --> 01:34:51,818
Rachel, you're looking at
a possible 5-year sentence

1535
01:34:51,886 --> 01:34:54,514
for impeding a federal investigation,

1536
01:34:54,655 --> 01:34:56,816
but I don't wanna go to trial.

1537
01:34:57,291 --> 01:35:00,260
So, I want to give you a chance
to plead this sentence down.

1538
01:35:00,327 --> 01:35:05,822
I want you to look in my eyes
and gauge my sincerity.

1539
01:35:05,900 --> 01:35:09,700
Use your reporter's instincts. Okay?
You're good with those.

1540
01:35:10,604 --> 01:35:14,472
- I'm gonna offer you 2 years.
- No. No.

1541
01:35:14,542 --> 01:35:19,036
No, it's gonna be suspended
sentence, probation.

1542
01:35:19,113 --> 01:35:20,740
You have to respect
what she's been through.

1543
01:35:20,848 --> 01:35:25,217
Albert, 2 years is not
as good an offer as it could be,

1544
01:35:25,286 --> 01:35:26,844
but it's not as bad, either.

1545
01:35:28,089 --> 01:35:31,855
Because you're guilty, Miss Armstrong.
You're guilty as charged,

1546
01:35:31,926 --> 01:35:36,260
and if you want to waltz
into a courtroom in a martyr's cloak,

1547
01:35:37,732 --> 01:35:41,463
trust me, you're gonna see something
that you have not seen yet.

1548
01:35:41,535 --> 01:35:45,198
Because this polite,
country lawyer demeanor

1549
01:35:45,272 --> 01:35:48,799
is gonna give way to a wave
of self- righteous indignation

1550
01:35:48,876 --> 01:35:51,504
that you can't even begin to imagine.

1551
01:35:51,579 --> 01:35:54,309
That jury is gonna hear
fire- breathing oratory

1552
01:35:54,381 --> 01:35:58,078
about a country whose
security has been compromised,

1553
01:35:58,152 --> 01:36:02,646
a husband widowed, and a little girl
who's gotta visit her mother's grave

1554
01:36:02,723 --> 01:36:05,920
because you wanted to
chase a Pulitzer Prize.

1555
01:36:08,829 --> 01:36:11,559
So, if you force me to take you to trial,

1556
01:36:12,867 --> 01:36:14,528
I'm gonna make sure
that you don't make it home

1557
01:36:14,602 --> 01:36:18,595
- for your son's high school graduation.
- Come on, that's enough.

1558
01:36:20,174 --> 01:36:22,665
So, what's it gonna be, Rachel?

1559
01:36:28,048 --> 01:36:31,176
If I agree to this, there is one thing I need.

1560
01:36:33,921 --> 01:36:35,582
Oh, my God. You have gotten so handsome.

1561
01:36:36,724 --> 01:36:38,749
You're a real little man.

1562
01:36:38,859 --> 01:36:41,020
I'll bet you got all the girls
chasing after you, huh?

1563
01:36:41,095 --> 01:36:42,858
No.

1564
01:36:42,930 --> 01:36:44,955
No? Well, you will.

1565
01:36:45,032 --> 01:36:47,091
I don't care. Whatever.

1566
01:36:48,002 --> 01:36:50,698
Hey, I kind of like your hair this way.

1567
01:36:53,274 --> 01:36:56,539
- Look, I know you're mad at me.
- No, I'm not.

1568
01:36:57,244 --> 01:37:02,079
Well, I think you are, and I haven't
let you see me in a long time.

1569
01:37:02,616 --> 01:37:04,675
- I'd be mad at me, too.
- Well, I'm not. Okay?

1570
01:37:04,752 --> 01:37:05,844
Okay.

1571
01:37:06,854 --> 01:37:09,288
Look, kiddo, it hasn't
been easy for me, either.

1572
01:37:09,356 --> 01:37:10,789
If I'd known it was gonna go on this long,

1573
01:37:10,858 --> 01:37:12,018
I would have done things differently.

1574
01:37:12,092 --> 01:37:15,027
I would have let you see me
every single day.

1575
01:37:18,098 --> 01:37:19,759
I am so sorry.

1576
01:37:21,769 --> 01:37:23,964
Dad says you could have
got out of here many times.

1577
01:37:24,038 --> 01:37:26,006
Well, your dad is wrong.

1578
01:37:30,277 --> 01:37:32,768
- Look, kiddo...
- I'm not a kid anymore.

1579
01:37:32,847 --> 01:37:35,577
Okay, you know what? You can pretend
not to love me all you want,

1580
01:37:35,649 --> 01:37:38,140
and I can pretend to believe it,

1581
01:37:39,954 --> 01:37:41,683
but I love you,

1582
01:37:41,755 --> 01:37:45,521
and I think about you
every minute of every day.

1583
01:37:45,593 --> 01:37:47,356
Okay?

1584
01:37:47,428 --> 01:37:49,828
Dad says you're going to prison.

1585
01:37:50,931 --> 01:37:54,059
- I am.
- Isn't that where you are now?

1586
01:37:54,134 --> 01:37:55,499
No. This is jail.

1587
01:37:55,569 --> 01:37:57,696
Jail is where you go
when they decide your punishment,

1588
01:37:57,771 --> 01:37:59,671
and then you go to prison.

1589
01:38:00,474 --> 01:38:02,601
And what's your punishment?

1590
01:38:03,410 --> 01:38:06,140
- 2 years.
- That's a long time.

1591
01:38:06,680 --> 01:38:10,411
Yeah. But if I'm well- behaved,
then I might get out earlier.

1592
01:38:11,518 --> 01:38:12,507
So...

1593
01:38:12,953 --> 01:38:14,818
Is it dangerous there?

1594
01:38:15,623 --> 01:38:19,684
You know what?
If you visit me, come check on me,

1595
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:21,751
I'll be okay.

1596
01:38:25,165 --> 01:38:28,532
Okay. I'm kind of busy, but I'll try.

1597
01:38:30,371 --> 01:38:33,704
I think we should go now,
on account of traffic and all.

1598
01:38:33,774 --> 01:38:37,210
Hey, hey, how about a kiss? Just one.

1599
01:39:02,703 --> 01:39:03,761
Bye.

1600
01:39:59,593 --> 01:40:01,117
You're a tattletale!

1601
01:40:01,362 --> 01:40:03,762
- I am not!
- You just told on Nicky.

1602
01:40:03,831 --> 01:40:06,095
That's because he won't stop.

1603
01:40:06,166 --> 01:40:09,260
- You're a tattletale.
- Timmy, that's enough. Stop it.

1604
01:40:09,336 --> 01:40:11,463
- That's enough.
- But you're not supposed to tattle.

1605
01:40:11,538 --> 01:40:15,167
Well, you're not supposed
to have to put up with bullies, either.

1606
01:40:16,343 --> 01:40:18,140
Come on. Come on.

1607
01:40:20,214 --> 01:40:22,409
Are you a writer or something?

1608
01:40:22,483 --> 01:40:25,941
Yeah, I'm a reporter.
I work for the Capital Sun Times.

1609
01:40:26,120 --> 01:40:27,485
We get that newspaper.

1610
01:40:27,554 --> 01:40:29,579
Oh, yeah?
Well, tell all your friends to do the same.

1611
01:40:29,656 --> 01:40:33,888
- The Internet is killing us.
- Mom, how long till we get there?

1612
01:40:34,028 --> 01:40:37,486
- About 18 hours, Timmy.
- No, Mom, really.

1613
01:40:38,332 --> 01:40:40,527
I don't know. I don't know.

1614
01:40:43,871 --> 01:40:45,862
My daddy is a writer.

1615
01:40:45,939 --> 01:40:48,840
- He is? What does he write?
- He writes articles,

1616
01:40:48,909 --> 01:40:51,901
though my mom doesn't really like
what he writes about.

1617
01:40:52,012 --> 01:40:55,345
- What's he write about?
- He writes about the President.

1618
01:40:56,350 --> 01:40:58,375
- What's your last name?
- Van Doren.

1619
01:41:00,921 --> 01:41:03,219
Why doesn't your mommy
like what he writes about?

1620
01:41:03,290 --> 01:41:05,224
I heard her yelling at Daddy once.

1621
01:41:05,292 --> 01:41:08,693
'Cause he used her secret stuff,
she found out.

1622
01:41:08,762 --> 01:41:11,856
- What she found out?
- When she was in Venezula.

1623
01:41:12,699 --> 01:41:16,760
Why was your mom in Venezuela?
Was she on vacation?

1624
01:41:16,837 --> 01:41:19,567
No, she was working.

1625
01:41:19,640 --> 01:41:22,734
- Working?
- For the government.

1626
01:41:23,877 --> 01:41:27,404
But don't tell anybody
it's me who told you. Okay?

1627
01:41:30,317 --> 01:41:31,716
You bet.

1628
01:41:32,716 --> 01:41:42,716
