1
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,198
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

2
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,957
Oh, my!

3
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,918
Mrs Jones, Rosemary Jones?

4
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,038
Rosie, please, I prefer Rosie.

5
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,072
<i>- Is everything alright?
- Yes, fine...</i>

6
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,518
I was just checking the...

7
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,555
trunk, the big leather trunk.
Is that yours?

8
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,194
Yes, that's mine.

9
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,598
Good, thank you. Good.

10
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,957
Mrs Jones?

11
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,078
Good morning, officers.

12
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,912
Two dismembered bodies, Rosemary.

13
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,435
Why don't you just tell me who they are?

14
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:22,629
My husband and his mistress.
They were planning to run away together.

15
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,875
So you thought
you'd just kill them instead.

16
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,799
Well, I couldn't very well
stand idly by, could I?

17
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:37,239
Rosemary Jones, you've been found guilty
for the crime of manslaughter.

18
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,913
Manslaughter! And at the time
you committed these acts,

19
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,593
you were suffering from such an
abnormality of mind,

20
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,150
that it seriously impaired
your responsibility.

21
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,351
I therefore make an order
for your detention...

22
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,995
in a secure unit
for the criminally insane.

23
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,351
Not to be free,

24
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:04,235
until such time as the home secretary
decides that your continued detention...

25
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:08,273
is no longer necessary
for the protection of the public.

26
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,750
I don't suppose there's any chance
for a cup of tea, is there?

27
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,993
Thank you very much for coming.
Very nice to see you again.

28
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,277
- Goodbye Mrs Martin.
- Marvellous sermon, Vicar.

29
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,436
Very kind, thank you.

30
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:48,359
- Thank you, Reverend Goodfellow.
- You're very welcome, Mrs Parker.

31
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:54,350
I just wanted to have a word with you
about the flower arranging committee.

32
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,913
- Yes of course. Perhaps...
- This afternoon.

33
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,912
Mrs Goodfellow is not with you again?

34
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,756
No, no. Sorry about that.
She's been very busy. Mrs Parker.

35
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,394
- Next week perhaps?
- Perhaps, yes.

36
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,159
Although,
she is incredibly busy at the moment.

37
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,758
For fuck's sake. Jesus Christ!

38
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,072
What's a girl got to do to get
a decent nights sleep around here?

39
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,597
Holly!

40
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,553
- Don't forget about Tuesday.
- Sorry, it's Tuesday.

41
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,757
Petey.

42
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,192
Fuck off.
Holly, it's time to wake up.

43
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,837
Holly...

44
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,749
Holly, I know you're in there,
would you please come out, right away!

45
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,394
Mother!
I don't think you want me to do that.

46
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,432
I think you'll find I bloody well do.

47
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,752
Is that you, Carl?
No, this is Mark.

48
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,792
Nice to meet you, Mrs Goodfellow.

49
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,750
- Holly, this is totally unacceptable.
- I'm 17, it's been legal for a year.

50
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,553
Legal does not make it decent.

51
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,592
Is everything alright, Mrs Goodfellow?

52
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,320
Yes, everything is fine, Mrs Parker.

53
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,352
- Is that Holly I heard?
- Holly? No.

54
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,038
Morning, Mrs Parker.

55
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,957
Morning.

56
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:21,108
- You know the thing that pains me the most?
- No. But you'll tell me anyway.

57
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,118
- You're an intelligent girl.
- An intelligent girl who's got a libido.

58
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,033
An intelligent girl
knows what to do with it.

59
00:08:27,118 --> 00:08:28,153
I know it.

60
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,237
Holly.

61
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,835
We used to be such friends.
Hello.

62
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:42,478
- Now you cross with me all the time.
- Because you are a total and utter bitch.

63
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,513
- Look at you two. Morning, sweetheart.
- Morning.

64
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,832
It's sort of as we feared, the pond.

65
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:54,192
I've been chatting with the chaps
at the Water Board. Looks like it's algae.

66
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,596
It could be one of two
or three different types apparently.

67
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:02,236
Some of them poisonous.
They're worried about the water-table.

68
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,390
Anyway, they say it will get worse
if it's not dealt with.

69
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,591
A lot of things will get worse
if they're not dealt with.

70
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:13,952
- They'll come back to me with the details.
- The devil's in the details, Dad.

71
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,992
Could we not say that word on a Sunday.

72
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,672
Dad!

73
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,952
- Alright.
- Where are you going now?

74
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,915
- I've got work to do.
- You've just been to work.

75
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,997
I've got to write a speech
for that convention,

76
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,429
God's mysterious ways,

77
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,359
and that's all I've got to show for it,
a title.

78
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,388
- See, you're an utter bitch to him.
- No, I'm not.

79
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,671
- And I know why, you're not getting any.
- What?

80
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,314
The same reason
you're angry with me and Mark.

81
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,670
In the van, in front of the house,
on a Sunday.

82
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,713
- That might have more to do with it.
- I don't think so.

83
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,359
- You must be right then.
- Well, I usually am.

84
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,634
Can I get you any?

85
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,798
- Petey, how long have you been there?
- Holly says you're not getting any.

86
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,833
- Can I get you some?
- Petey, that's very thoughtful,

87
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,512
but no, you can't.

88
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:31,595
- Let's face it. I'm no good at this.
- No, you just need a little tweaking,

89
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:35,633
a little Lance adjustment,
but that's another story.

90
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,190
Alright now, Gloria.

91
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:44,075
- I told you that the key is in the swing.
- Well, I never had a good swing.

92
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,715
I disagree.
I bet you could swing really well.

93
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,635
Now, you grip that shaft,
gently but firmly.

94
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,751
Now, spread your legs.
A little more.

95
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,032
Now you bend to the ball slowly.

96
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,318
Yeah. Now, bend your knees.

97
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,752
Yeah.

98
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,678
- Feel good?
- Yes, feels fine.

99
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,472
Okay.

100
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,556
- Now you just keep your eye on the ball.
- Okay.

101
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,195
- You let me worry about the hole.
- Right.

102
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,637
- That's quite good.
- Well, your ball is in the rough,

103
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,672
- but it's a good feeling, no?
- Yeah.

104
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,917
One more?

105
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,349
Okay.

106
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,656
<i>Mrs Parker asked after
you again this morning.</i>

107
00:11:58,741 --> 00:11:59,958
Surprise, surprise.

108
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,039
- I think I'm beginning to run out excuses.
- Well, then don't make any.

109
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,789
You know what you can do, you can go down
and kill that bloody dog,

110
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,832
and I'll put in a month of Sundays.

111
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,393
Was that a brassier
over Holly's shoulder this morning?

112
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,033
You're a half day behind the rest of us,
you know that?

113
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,478
We call it a bra nowadays.

114
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,192
Why did she have it over her shoulder?

115
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,718
She was doing the laundry.

116
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,557
Mr Brown?

117
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:24,399
Mr Brown, it's Mrs Goodfellow,
about Clarence, it's about your dog.

118
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,278
- You woke me.
- Yes, well, your dog woke me.

119
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,915
- What did you say?
- I said your dog woke me.

120
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,277
- Well, he's found his voice.
- Yes, he has, hasn't he?

121
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:44,270
I was wondering whether we could perhaps
keep him inside just the night-time.

122
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,791
Got your sandwiches and sports bag?
Yes. Yes!

123
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:54,037
- Daddy is picking you up this afternoon.
- But Daddy forgets.

124
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:59,279
No! And tomorrow it's a new housekeeper,
and she's paid not to forget.

125
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,249
<i>I thought you were going to be
brave and take the bus this year.</i>

126
00:14:02,292 --> 00:14:03,274
Next year.

127
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:08,519
No, you said that last year.
Come on, you're going to have a good time.

128
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,398
See you around, Goodfellow.

129
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,758
My shoelace is undone.

130
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:24,116
- Tell me about when you were a girl.
- Petey, you know already.

131
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,556
Alright then.

132
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,479
When I was a girl,
I lived in a big scary house.

133
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:34,355
- With the black women.
- No, they wore black, they were nuns.

134
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,278
Mostly Irish, and mostly evil.

135
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,792
- And you were there because you were awful.
- No, I was an orphan. Orphan, darling.

136
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:45,719
- Come on, off you go have a good day.
- Remember to make Daddy remember.

137
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,557
Promise.

138
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,797
She's here already? The housekeeper.

139
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:07,833
No, no, just her trunk.
It arrived while you were out.

140
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:12,273
It's a lovely old thing. Isn't it?
Well, well, well.

141
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,234
Look at that. Grace.

142
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,548
- Is it a sign, do you think?
- No, I think it's a trunk.

143
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,196
In the books I read when I was a boy
there was always a trunk just like this,

144
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,119
- full of treasure.
- You will remember to pick up Pete?

145
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,153
- I can't this afternoon.
- Alright. I'll write it down.

146
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,749
I've got to take Mrs Applebee
to the garden centre.

147
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,030
Now, where's the pen? The Pen?

148
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,954
Look at this.

149
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,632
You've made it really nice up here.
Grace should be very happy.

150
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:57,674
You know, Lilian and Brian have made love
in every single room in their house.

151
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:04,513
- Their house is smaller.
- Yes, but they went around twice.

152
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:10,353
- I'm late for work already.
- So, what's half an hour?

153
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:14,393
You take this off, and you're just
a man, Walter Goodfellow.

154
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,108
Don't forget Petey, now.

155
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,152
Lord, yes.
I think I wrote it down.

156
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,832
Yep.

157
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,477
Hello!

158
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,797
Petey!

159
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,237
Petey?

160
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,429
Walter?

161
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:08,883
Hi, Darling. We're just
talking about the Algae and...

162
00:17:09,052 --> 00:17:10,279
Where's Petey?

163
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:15,278
Lord. I'm sorry. Mrs Hallyway rang me
about her crisis of faith.

164
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:19,916
- She was on the verge of losing it.
- I know the bloody feeling.

165
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,957
- Let's get him.
- No, this is really unnecessary.

166
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,878
Should I push him? Do
you want to be pushed?

167
00:17:37,963 --> 00:17:38,958
No, please.

168
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,595
- I'm going to count to three. Three.
- No!

169
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,791
See you in the morning.

170
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,912
Deary, deary me. Look at you.

171
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:57,508
Give me a hand. Let me help you up.
You look so uncomfortable.

172
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,199
- No one has a clue where he is.
- I don't understand.

173
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,794
There he is!

174
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,518
Who the bloody hell is that?

175
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,272
Hey, what are you doing with my son?

176
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,934
Come here, come on. Quick.

177
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,632
- You must be Gloria.
- Get in the car.

178
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:45,359
Look, I think,
there might be a misunderstanding.

179
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:50,115
You bet your life
there's a misunderstanding.

180
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,515
Grace Hawkins.

181
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,028
- You're Grace Hawkins.
- Yes.

182
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,993
- Mrs Hawkins, welcome to Little Wallop.
- Thank you, Vicar.

183
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:16,113
- I'm sorry about earlier, Mrs Hawkins.
- No. Not at all.

184
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,630
Under the circumstances
you did just the right thing.

185
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,519
I could have been anybody,
and please call me Grace.

186
00:19:22,688 --> 00:19:23,832
Reverend!

187
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:28,795
Mrs Parker, may I introduce you
to our new housekeeper, Grace Hawkins.

188
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:33,868
Mrs Parker is chairman... chair of the
St. Michael's Flower Arranging Committee.

189
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:38,277
- Which I wanted to talk to you about.
- We will talk about it, we really will,

190
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,408
<i>but Grace has literally just
arrived, and I was wondering...</i>

191
00:19:41,493 --> 00:19:42,598
The tricks...

192
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,713
<i>We'd better go in. They'll be forever.
... are quite unbelievable.</i>

193
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:50,230
In my whole experience
in 43 years on this committee.

194
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,272
I'm well aware of this problem.

195
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,076
This is just...

196
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,835
- He's a persistent little fellow, isn't he?
- It's not what I call him.

197
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,558
I've given it a good airing,
but it's still a little bit musty.

198
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,194
No, it's perfect.

199
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:20,633
It's just as I imagined it.
A perfect home for a perfect family.

200
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,993
- Well, let's hope they make us an offer.
- A sense of humour.

201
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,750
- I like that.
- Good, because you're going to need one.

202
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,394
There you go again.

203
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,755
- How are we going to get that upstairs?
- We'll find a way.

204
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:47,793
- What do you think is in it?
- I don't know and I didn't ask.

205
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,674
- Holly!
- I just want to know what's in it.

206
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,314
Memories, dear.

207
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,078
A life time of memories.

208
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,634
And a few clothes.

209
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,312
You must be Holly. My, you are tall.

210
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,477
You must get that from your father's side.

211
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,398
- This is David.
- Hi.

212
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:19,277
The women in this family certainly share
a taste for good looking fellows.

213
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,475
- Holly, are you taking the weight?
- This way.

214
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:30,236
- A sharp left, darling.
- Watch it, watch it.

215
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,875
Sorry, sorry.
Now this door's very narrow.

216
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,515
Slowly down. Watch your fingers.
That's fine.

217
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:48,558
Well now, I don't think the occasion
should go by without a few words.

218
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,592
- Walter.
- Just a few words, Gloria.

219
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,678
Lord, thank you for this day.

220
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,192
And thank you for bringing us Grace,

221
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:04,479
who joined our family today and who
we hope will be very happy here.

222
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,998
And thank you also for Carl...

223
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,989
- Mark...
- David.

224
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,519
David,

225
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,552
who we've also only just met, actually,

226
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,272
but who seems to be a very...

227
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,318
- nice young man indeed.
- Amen.

228
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:29,480
- Alright, who would like a cup of tea?
- Yeah, we'd better get going.

229
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:34,355
- Thank you for that, Walter. Vicar, sir.
- You're very welcome, Grace.

230
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,392
- I meant every word.
- Thank you.

231
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,072
God, you drive me crazy.

232
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,874
- God.
- No...

233
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:01,114
No, stop, stop!

234
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,549
<i>Okay, I know where we could
drive. That's five minutes away.</i>

235
00:23:04,676 --> 00:23:05,791
Not the shed.

236
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,638
- You know it?
- Of course I know it!

237
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:12,389
I'm the Vicar's wife, Lance.
I'd have to drive half a day...

238
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,318
- before I'm not recognized.
- So let's stay.

239
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,591
- You want our first time to be in a car.
- Honey, I just want our first time.

240
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,790
I'm not doing it in a car.

241
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,753
Women in my age don't do it in cars.
That's the sort of thing my daughter does.

242
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:28,793
- She does? No, I hear you.
- There's a time and a place, Lance.

243
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,832
- Like Mexico.
- Exactly, like Mexico.

244
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,158
- Which is exactly where we are going to be.
- When?

245
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,236
Soon, I promise.

246
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,750
I just want a break.
I just need a break.

247
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,395
- Just a couple of weeks.
- We'll be there in a heartbeat, baby.

248
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:47,432
Naked and living of the fruits of love.

249
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,874
- Warm sun.
- Tequila.

250
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,637
Hot salsa.

251
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,875
- Would that be the music or the food.
- I think, a bit of both.

252
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,477
- Good night then.
- A little good night kiss.

253
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,983
Are you crazy? They're all
watching. That's Mrs Parker!

254
00:24:21,068 --> 00:24:22,116
Who?

255
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:26,833
Come on. She probably...
She probably can't even see.

256
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,955
Just pretend you're a taxi and go.
Go on.

257
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,995
- I'll call you.
- What the hell am I doing?

258
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,072
I hope you know because I have no clue.

259
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,114
My Lord.

260
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,438
So you must be Holly.

261
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,793
See you next time sweetie.

262
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,114
Jesus Christ.

263
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:24,355
Can't we have some good old fashioned rock
to smite that little fucker dead.

264
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,995
Then I might start listening to you again.

265
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:34,153
- I'm sorry, did I startle you?
- No, no. Is everything okay?

266
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,233
Yes. I just wanted to thank you.
Thank you very much.

267
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:42,433
No, not at all. It's me
who should be thanking you, really.

268
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,552
- Well, good night, dear.
- Good night.

269
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:50,395
- You know, my father was a minister.
- Really?

270
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:55,553
- That's a coincidence.
- So, I know their little ways.

271
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:00,554
Well I think you'll find
Walter is quite set in his.

272
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:05,196
- You just leave him to me, dear.
- Why couldn't I just do that.

273
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:08,471
- Should I close the door?
- That would be lovely.

274
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,398
- Good night, dear.
- Good night.

275
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,797
Alright.

276
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,114
Clarence!

277
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,751
Clarence?

278
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,476
Where's that bloody dog?

279
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,194
Wakey, wakey.

280
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:53,118
I thought you deserved a lie-in.

281
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:56,152
Breakfast is ready when you are.

282
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:02,239
- I slept straight through.
- Makes a change.

283
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,639
Fantastic.

284
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:11,079
- Grace, this is absolutely fantastic.
- Thank you, Vicar. Here's a toast, dear.

285
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,671
Breakfast is the most important meal
of the day, did you know that, Holly?

286
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,712
I vaguely remember Mom
failing to drum that into me.

287
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,432
Good morning.

288
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,598
As it's such a big day for you, Vicar,
I've given you extra.

289
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,793
- It's only a bit of fun, Grace.
- Can't I talk you out of it.

290
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,239
No.

291
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:34,273
It's going to be the most embarrassing day
of my life, again.

292
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,876
- It's all in a good cause.
- That doesn't make it less embarrassing.

293
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:41,913
- I think it could be fun.
- She's new, she'll learn.

294
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:56,634
- Chin up, chin up.
- I just need to warm up a bit, I think.

295
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,558
- Bad luck Vicar.
- Dear.

296
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:10,032
- No, I just can't watch.
- Holly.

297
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,119
Why hang around just to see him humiliate
himself in front of the whole village?

298
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:17,755
As if I don't get enough of that
every Sunday.

299
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,835
- He's a handsome fellow, isn't he?
- What?

300
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,235
Your husband.

301
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,077
Come on!

302
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,718
Cuts quite an athletic figure.

303
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,598
I'll be back in a minute.

304
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,816
<i>Let's cheer for your father,
shall we, perhaps that'll help.</i>

305
00:29:52,859 --> 00:29:53,830
Come on, Dad.

306
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,474
- Come on, Vicar.
- Hi.

307
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:01,158
- Perhaps next time.
- I'm sorry.

308
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,278
I was waving. Oh, dear.

309
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,310
- Sorry, sorry. I'm sorry about that.
- Come on, Vicar.

310
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,238
Pray for guidance, Vicar.

311
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,358
That was only just in.

312
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,237
Sorry.

313
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,917
Sorry.

314
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,910
- You alright, Vicar?
- I'm fine.

315
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:07,111
- I'm just winded. I think I'm fine.
- No, no.

316
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:11,153
- I promise you. I'm sure I can carry on.
- Take a breather.

317
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,229
- Come on.
- You okay, Dad?

318
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,278
<i>Yes, I'm fine.</i>

319
00:31:15,363 --> 00:31:18,273
Hard luck, Vic. Thank
you, Grace. I did my best.

320
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,473
- Would you like a nice hot cup of tea?
- That sounds wonderful, Grace.

321
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:32,513
- Come on, let's get your father some tea.
- Thank you.

322
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,954
To me, to me!

323
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:50,393
- That was bad luck out there, Reverend.
- Thank you.

324
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:55,993
- Well, I guess these things happen?
- Yes, they certainly do. They just did.

325
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,036
I went for the ball, Ref.

326
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,072
Well, I got to hand it to you,
Walter,

327
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:10,113
you sure took it like a man,
I'll say that for you.

328
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:18,635
- I'm sorry, I... Have we...
- Sorry, Lance.

329
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,474
I see your wife.

330
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,314
- I'm her golf pro.
- Yes.

331
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,352
She takes her golf very seriously.

332
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,912
Yeah, always comes on time, too.

333
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:37,269
Yes, she's very good like that.
Very good.

334
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,077
Well...

335
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:51,273
- Nice to meet you, Walter.
- Nice to meet you, Lance.

336
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,950
Are you trying to make this
as awkward as possible?

337
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,595
We were just two guys shooting the breeze.

338
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:15,039
Nothing to worry about.
Besides, you can't blame a man...

339
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:20,757
- for wanting to check out his competition.
- Yeah, but that's my husband.

340
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,189
So, guess what.

341
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,199
- I talked to my travel guide last night.
- Really? And what did he say?

342
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,232
- When are we leaving?
- It's all good.

343
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,794
Here you go, Petey.

344
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,642
<i>I'll drive so I can show you
the way, then you can drive.</i>

345
00:34:01,685 --> 00:34:02,711
I can't.

346
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:06,753
- No, it's alright you're on my insurance.
- No, I can't drive.

347
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:11,479
Well, it's never to late to learn.
Good morning.

348
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:15,912
- Hi, you haven't seen Clarence, have you?
- No, I'm afraid not.

349
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:19,555
It's not like him,
it's not like him at all.

350
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:26,392
Oh, dear. Never mind, the best night's
sleep I've had in a long time.

351
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:30,152
Every cloud has a silver lining.

352
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,077
Clarence!

353
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:36,035
You little bugger, where are you?
Clarence!

354
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:39,638
Get out of the way! Move!

355
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:50,471
I've got to order a new track suit.
Would you like me to come in with you?

356
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,398
- Is that a good idea?
- Yeah.

357
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:20,879
So in Mexico
they have these endless miles...

358
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:24,037
of perfect glistening white sand beaches.

359
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:28,039
And what we're going to do,
for the rest of our lives,

360
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:32,392
is to find our own little stretch,
our own little private place,

361
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:35,034
just you and me.

362
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,153
And then what I going to do,

363
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:42,796
is, I am going to cover your body
with coconut cream every day,

364
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,832
and I am going to start at your toes,

365
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:50,511
<i>and I going to lick my way up slowly
all the way to your little...</i>

366
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,552
Well, that sounds lovely.
When do we go?

367
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,909
Fuck!

368
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:18,435
- How was he?
- Petrified. Poor Petey.

369
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,917
Hello?

370
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:29,072
Hello, Lilian. I can't really talk
right now, can I call you back, later?

371
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:32,112
- I found the perfect spot.
- Bye.

372
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:38,195
Yes, that was Lilian,
an old friend of mine.

373
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,197
Clarence!

374
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,157
Clarence!

375
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:50,518
Clarence, where are you?

376
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:54,197
And then once we broke into the boy's
college in the middle of the night,

377
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:57,755
me and some friends and did
a striptease for the lads.

378
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:02,396
It wasn't any old college either,
it was religion and philosophy.

379
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:06,553
- Is that where you met Walter?
- That's where I met Walter.

380
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:11,113
He was post-grad and I was a first year,
and he was...

381
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:15,152
He was just different from the others.

382
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,592
Still is. Not many like him around.

383
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,637
- Put your finger on here, will you?
- But why is it,

384
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:28,879
when they eventually do find God,
that they lose their sense of humour?

385
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,437
Hello?

386
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,274
Lilian, again.

387
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,994
Where are you?

388
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,593
That was Lilian and I'm going for a nip
into town and meet her for lunch.

389
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,437
Lilian?

390
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:09,679
- I'd so like to meet her.
- Yes, of course!

391
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,318
I'll sort something out.

392
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,839
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

393
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,795
Gods ways are mysterious,
that's why we say:

394
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,674
God's mysterious ways.

395
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:41,316
I mean, look at Job and all
that befell him. He asks the Lord:

396
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,512
"Why are you doing all of this to me?"

397
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,638
And God could have explained,

398
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:52,355
but instead he just said:
"Trust me, Job."

399
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:56,038
Now that's mysterious.

400
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,312
God?

401
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,234
Yes, Walter?

402
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,792
How do you think it's sounding?

403
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:22,472
Well, the title stinks, for a start.

404
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:26,474
Hi, I'm sorry.
I can't agree with God about that.

405
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:29,512
- Goodness, Grace.
- Hope you don't mind.

406
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:33,593
No, no, no, I was just practising
for the convention.

407
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,558
It's very thought provoking.

408
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,918
Dry and boring, I think, you mean.

409
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,952
- But that's me all over.
- Nonsense.

410
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:46,716
I'm not the most vibrant of individuals.

411
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,638
A bit serious, perhaps.

412
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:54,073
- You've hit the nail on the head there.
- Reverend Goodfellow!

413
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:58,193
Reverend Goodfellow! I just wanted
to speak to you about...

414
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,398
- Mrs Hawkins.
- Mrs Parker.

415
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:10,159
Is it possible to have a word with you,
privately?

416
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:14,355
It's about
the flower arranging committee.

417
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:18,758
It has taken a turn for the worse.
I have never in all my life,

418
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,792
- I have never, never...
- Mrs Parker,

419
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,992
the Reverend is practising his sermon.

420
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,752
Yes, I have a convention coming up.

421
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,517
I see.

422
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,077
Very well.

423
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:41,034
Goodbye, Mrs Parker.

424
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:45,559
- Oh, dear. I hope that didn't...
- Course not.

425
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:50,396
For goodness sake, you are a busy man,
Vicar, people should realize that.

426
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,237
Right.

427
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,152
Yes.

428
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,032
Now.

429
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,954
About your sermon.

430
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,432
Yes?

431
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,914
Do you like jokes?

432
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,315
Jokes?

433
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:36,713
So you see, God is very tired
and he say to St. Peter:

434
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,952
"Look, Peter... Petey," he says,

435
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:44,113
"I'm absolutely exhausted.
I need a holiday, I really do.

436
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:47,672
Is there anywhere you can suggest?"
So,

437
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,278
St. Peter thinks for a bit,
and then he says: "Well I know,"

438
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:54,312
he says, "what about the moon?"

439
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:59,315
And God said: "No, I don't think so.
Not the moon, there's no atmosphere."

440
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,152
- Yeah, that's funny.
- I'm not finished, yet. So then God says:

441
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:09,955
"I really want something different." So,
St. Peter says: "Well, what about Earth?"

442
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,879
And God says:
"No, I went there 2000 years ago.

443
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:19,637
I met this nice little Jewish girl,
and they're still talking about it."

444
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:41,034
I did good?

445
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,754
You look beautiful.

446
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,557
After you.

447
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,919
- Fabulous, right?
- Yes!

448
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:56,838
The tickets are on their way.

449
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:07,194
Baby! Oh, baby!

450
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,789
This is it! God.

451
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:16,308
- I need...
- Wait!

452
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:19,352
- What?
- Let me take my clothes off.

453
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,512
Okay.

454
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,838
Oh, man. God almighty!

455
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,514
Slow, slow, slow.

456
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:00,475
Yeah! Oh, God almighty.
You make me crazy.

457
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:11,069
- God, what's that?
- What?

458
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:12,712
That.

459
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:18,035
- This is my love thing.
- I know what it is.

460
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:21,470
- I thought you Brits like this kind of thing.
- No.

461
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,398
You do not think this is hot?

462
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,312
No.

463
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,552
You didn't turn your phone off.

464
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,278
Hello?

465
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:41,912
What?

466
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,598
Who the hell's this?

467
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:49,912
- A girl.
- I don't know any girls.

468
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:54,119
- I got it, I'll just take it off.
- No, keep it on.

469
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:58,551
In fact you could put everything back on.
I think we had quite enough for today.

470
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,357
Good Lord.

471
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:19,314
"Giggle with God".

472
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,837
No.

473
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:55,478
Is everything alright, Vicar?

474
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:58,758
It's just so quiet, Grace.

475
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:01,834
Lovely, isn't it?

476
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:06,192
- Have a good afternoon.
- And you.

477
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:22,079
Very good.

478
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:30,635
Is your dad going to make
you pray tonight?

479
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:34,959
- Shut up.
- Does he make you pray to baby Jesus?

480
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:39,599
- Just leave me alone.
- Run to granny, you prat.

481
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:43,798
- Are you alright?
- Yeah.

482
00:47:55,400 --> 00:48:00,235
You know, I was wondering, if you had
a magic word, what word would it be?

483
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:04,193
- I mean, what's your favourite word?
- My favourite word?

484
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,834
- Broccoli
- Broccoli?

485
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:10,478
Well, I don't know. Why not?

486
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:16,712
It's alright, Petey, it's alright.

487
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:20,475
You just close your eyes.
Keep them closed.

488
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:24,518
Now say the magic word.

489
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,438
Broccoli.

490
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:29,074
Now open them.

491
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:32,074
See what happens.

492
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:39,275
- Look, there's God boy.
- It's alright.

493
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:46,312
You're dead, God boy, you're dead!

494
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:55,555
- My breaks aren't working!
- I can't stop!

495
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:11,752
- Who's that?
- He's Billy Martin.

496
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:16,473
Good old Broccoli.
Shall we have some for supper?

497
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:31,517
Hi, Mom.

498
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:35,352
You know, flour can be so sensual.

499
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:39,997
In Heaven it took me 3 months to find
a priest up here for the wedding.

500
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:42,904
How long do you think it
would take me to find a lawyer?

501
00:49:43,031 --> 00:49:44,079
Yeah, I like that.

502
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:47,317
Gloria, you're back.
This is Mark...

503
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:50,238
- David...
- Grant.

504
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:56,759
Now this is a good one.
Holly! Come and listen to this.

505
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:59,394
Sit down. So...

506
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:04,748
This Vicar is stopped for speeding,
and the policeman smells alcohol...

507
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:08,349
and sees an empty bottle of wine
on the passenger's side floor.

508
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:12,313
And he says: " Have you been drinking,
Reverend?". And the vicar says,

509
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:14,954
all innocent, like...

510
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,389
all innocent, like...

511
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:20,432
And the vicar says all innocent,
like:

512
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:24,872
"Just water, Officer." And the policeman
looks over to the bottle and says:

513
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:27,912
"Well, that looks like wine to me."

514
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:32,471
"Wine!" cries the Vicar,
"Good Lord, he's done it again."

515
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:38,033
- That's funny.
- Yes, that is quite funny, isn't it?

516
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:41,394
Mummy! Mummy!

517
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:46,312
Billy Martin came after me,
but Grace was there and I said "Broccoli",

518
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:50,239
- and now he's dead. Billy Martin's dead!
- Oh, my!

519
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:53,955
- Aren't you a busy bee?
- Grace, this is Grant.

520
00:50:54,946 --> 00:50:57,278
Is it Halloween?

521
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:02,597
- Jokes, Grace. Have lots of them!
- Well done, you.

522
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:07,793
Isn't this nice?
Billy Martin is dead!

523
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:12,837
Could we have a word?
Billy Martin is dead?

524
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:16,998
Good Lord, no. No, he's not dead,
he was just unconscious, if I may judge.

525
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:21,033
But, please, don't tell Petey,
because he's so excited.

526
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:24,989
- Grace, can you come and look at the pie?
- Of course, dear.

527
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:29,033
- I fucked up big time.
- She shouldn't use that language.

528
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:40,793
Let me get this straight.
My son's rid of his bullies.

529
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:45,352
My husband has become a comedian.

530
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:50,153
And my nymphomaniac daughter
has discovered cookery.

531
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:54,674
What's going on?

532
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:24,075
I'm so sorry!

533
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:27,999
- I'm so sorry. Did I wake you?
- No, not at all.

534
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:33,033
- Did I disturb you and Walter?
- Chance, be a fine thing.

535
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:37,074
- Good night.
- Good night. You know,

536
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:40,112
men do sometimes lose their way, dear.

537
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:43,916
I mean, Walter is sweet soul,
but he's a bit...

538
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:46,952
slow-witted like the rest of them.

539
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:51,353
I'm sure he'll find his way back to you
in the end.

540
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:56,511
- So you were married, too?
- Yes, I was. A long time ago.

541
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:02,153
- Did he lose his way?
- With a little help from another woman.

542
00:53:05,382 --> 00:53:07,912
Completely lost his head over her.

543
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:13,272
Do you have a couple of minutes?

544
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:21,195
You sit down.
I've got something to show you.

545
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:23,994
Here it is.

546
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,833
Look, that's me when I was six.

547
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:33,678
- So sweet.
- I was a live one.

548
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:35,312
Was?

549
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:38,478
Here he is. That's him.

550
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,635
What was his name?

551
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,477
Arthur.

552
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:50,514
He's very dapper.

553
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:55,316
I was a fool for a handsome fellow.
I was young. I was very young.

554
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:57,277
Too young.

555
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:00,194
And then he dabbled.

556
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:04,354
And that was that.

557
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:07,672
Walter only dabbles with God nowadays.

558
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:11,352
In that case he'll come back to you.

559
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:16,436
God would never stand in the way
of such a beautiful young woman.

560
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,872
Will you find your way back to me?

561
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:55,277
Could you?

562
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:20,358
Clarence, is that you?

563
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:27,637
Clarence?

564
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:50,754
My God! Clarence!

565
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:56,912
God!

566
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:26,794
- Do you think he found that bloody dog yet?
- Mr Brown is on holiday.

567
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:29,718
Is he? Where has he gone?

568
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:32,174
I think, he said Down Under.

569
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:50,672
Hey.

570
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:52,872
So...

571
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:57,352
I have been up every night thinking.

572
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:03,439
If we only get one chance for happiness
in our entire lives, Gloria,

573
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:07,753
that nobody should ever die
without having found it.

574
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:10,197
I'm not alone.

575
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:13,314
I'm not alone.

576
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:23,798
So, I talked to my guy,

577
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:26,874
and Mexico is on.

578
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:30,558
- I got a date tomorrow.
- What?

579
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:34,272
I told you, when I move fast...

580
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:38,759
- That's too fast, change it.
- I can't, the ticket's are booked.

581
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:41,678
- Change the tickets.
- Honey, they're booked.

582
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:44,314
You can't change them?

583
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:48,239
Gloria, this is everything
we've been dreaming of.

584
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:49,907
And the hotel?

585
00:57:50,076 --> 00:57:53,356
Hotel's perfect. On the
beach, like you said?

586
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:58,316
- Yes! I mean, walking distance, seconds.
- The best hotels are on the beach, Lance.

587
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:02,876
Gloria,
this is so much better than a hotel.

588
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:06,230
- For fuck's sake, it's a time share.
- Here we are.

589
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:10,273
Grace! Grace, this is Lance,
my golf instructor.

590
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:14,469
- Lance, that is Grace, our housekeeper.
- It is very nice to meet you, Grace.

591
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:18,513
- Gloria has told me all about you.
- You're American.

592
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:21,438
- Yes.
- That obvious?

593
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:27,269
- Well, please don't let me interrupt you.
- Sorry.

594
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:30,312
We just talked about our next session,

595
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:33,910
our next practise session of golf.
Weren't we, Lance?

596
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:38,556
- Right, practise session.
- We can talk about it later, can't we?

597
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:43,115
Well, actually...
I kind of need to know now.

598
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,992
- It can't wait?
- It's all confirmed.

599
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:51,551
- Well, I have concerns.
- What... kind of concerns?

600
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:59,151
I just want to make sure we have
the right equipment... the right kit.

601
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:02,192
I'm not sure we have the right wood.

602
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:06,758
Hey, you are talking to me.

603
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:10,475
You do not have to worry yourself
about wood.

604
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:17,314
Yes or no, Gloria?

605
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:22,837
Alright.

606
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:28,154
Okay. Good.

607
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:33,832
It was nice to meet you, Lance.

608
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:36,917
It's a pleasure to meet you, too, Grace.

609
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:39,838
About 5 o'clock? The place?

610
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:43,478
- The usual place?
- Okay.

611
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:47,715
Okay, well, you ladies,
have a lovely lunch.

612
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:55,118
He's got a marvellous swing.

613
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:57,074
Has he?

614
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:00,870
I visit 2000 years ago,
I met this nice Jewish girl,

615
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:04,799
and they're still talking about it.
Ha, ha, ha...

616
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:08,438
But joking aside, it's true:

617
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:12,874
2000 years later,
and we are still talking about it,

618
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:16,913
and that's because it's something worth
talking about.

619
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:22,477
Grace.

620
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:26,192
With these jokes, things come alive.

621
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:29,799
- They really do.
- Excellent.

622
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:32,832
- You're doing very well, Vicar.
- Thank you.

623
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:35,872
Now, have you thought about sex?

624
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:42,637
- Sex?
- Yes.

625
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:49,233
- For the convention or...
- The bible is full of sex.

626
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:53,192
- Haven't you noticed?
- The bible?

627
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:58,072
The song of Solomon, for example.

628
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:02,353
No, that is the passionate
declaration of love...

629
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:06,032
- from a devoted man to God.
- No!

630
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:09,234
It's about sex.

631
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:12,238
Right.

632
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:15,158
Here, read it again, Reverend.

633
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:19,558
I'll make you a cup of tea.

634
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:35,075
"Let him kiss me
with the kisses of his mouth:

635
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,992
For thy love is better than wine.

636
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:43,512
His fruit was sweet to my taste.

637
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:47,912
His left hand is under my head,

638
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:51,432
and his right hand doth embrace me.

639
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:55,877
Behold,

640
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:58,798
thou art fair, my love.

641
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,797
Behold,

642
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:05,554
thou art fair.

643
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:15,472
Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet.

644
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:19,995
Thine eyes are as doves behind the veil.

645
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:24,198
And comely is thy mouth.

646
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:31,790
Thy two breasts are like forns
feeding among the lilies.

647
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:36,592
Thy navel is like a round goblet...

648
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:41,149
wherein no mingled wine is wanting.

649
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:48,632
Thy belly is like a heap of wheat,

650
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:51,998
set about with lilies.

651
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:57,028
Let thy breasts
be as clusters on the vine.

652
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:01,789
And thy mouth like the best wine.

653
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:08,514
Open to me my dove,

654
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:13,639
for my head is filled
with the drops of the night.

655
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:19,394
Come, my beloved,

656
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:22,432
let us see if the wine flourishes...

657
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:26,032
and the tender grapes appear...

658
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:29,152
and the pomegranates bud forth."

659
01:04:53,616 --> 01:04:55,999
Showtime!

660
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:19,474
Come on.

661
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:22,718
Come on to Uncle Lance.

662
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:27,358
No, no, don't. Come back.

663
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:30,077
Yeah!

664
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:34,672
My Lord.
They're just like little rose petals.

665
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:22,917
Bingo!

666
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:29,308
- God, Lance, you're a lucky man.
- Good evening.

667
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:32,238
Good evening. Can I help you?

668
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:35,035
- Grace, right?
- Yes.

669
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:38,993
I lost my... Have you seen my wallet?
I seem to have dropped it here.

670
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:50,758
Got my pen, got my speech,

671
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:56,440
- and I'm really rather nervous.
- You'll be fine, and I'll think of you.

672
01:06:56,480 --> 01:07:00,075
- Good.
- Jesus Christ, you two, put it away.

673
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:04,634
- Bye-bye.
- Bye, Dad.

674
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:07,713
- Cheerio, Petey. Goodbye, sweetheart.
- Bye, Dad.

675
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:09,557
Grace.

676
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:20,838
Forgotten something, darling?

677
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:24,873
- Have you seen Mr Brown lately?
- No, he's in Australia.

678
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:32,553
- I hope the convention goes well.
- Yes, thank you, Grace.

679
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:35,554
Goodbye, all.

680
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:41,994
Reverend Goodfellow!

681
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,958
- Reverend Goodfellow!
- Mrs Parker.

682
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,992
About the flower arranging committee...

683
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:56,553
which I will be more than happy to talk
to you about in a few days, when I'm back.

684
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,797
I see.

685
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:08,472
I noticed that your housekeeper...

686
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:12,633
was having a great deal of trouble
with her car last night.

687
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:15,437
Her car?

688
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:23,519
- That's not Grace's car, Mrs Parker.
- It's not?

689
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,992
I've seen it there often enough.

690
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:35,592
At first I thought it was a taxi.

691
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:55,673
Well, goodbyes are never easy,
but it's not forever, dear.

692
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:10,279
Hello, it's me. It's after five,
and I'm here and you're not.

693
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:14,833
So, well, it's funny actually,
because I only came here...

694
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:19,596
to tell you that I'm not coming,
but I guess you beat me to it.

695
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:24,999
Perhaps you're already there with
one of those girls you don't know.

696
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:28,838
Have a nice life, Lance.

697
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:38,753
<i>Before the break we were talklng
about murderers on parole...</i>

698
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:45,394
There you are.

699
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:49,675
- Dinner's at eight?
- He didn't show up then?

700
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:53,358
- What?
- Your American.

701
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:58,235
Your golf instructor,
your practise session.

702
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:01,318
No, no, he didn't. He's sick.

703
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:08,518
Yeah, he... he called it off.

704
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:09,955
Yeah.

705
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,992
<i>Awoman they called the Trunk Murderer.</i>

706
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:16,993
<i>- Rosemary Jones, Blll.
- Don't get me started on Rosemary Jones.</i>

707
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:22,512
<i>It really Is a sorry day and a sad soclety
when someone llke her Is released.</i>

708
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:26,919
<i>I thlnk we have some plctures, do we?
Yes: T he Trunk Murderer, so called,</i>

709
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:31,158
<i>because they found her husband and hls
mlstress chopped up In her trunk luggage.</i>

710
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:35,079

711
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:38,192
Yeah?

712
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:42,198
I think you'd better see this.

713
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:44,155
Mom!

714
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:48,352

718
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:06,954
My God.

719
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:21,598
God's Mysterious Ways. I think,
it's a good title, Reverend Goodfellow.

720
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:24,950
- I really do. I like it.
- Really? Thank you.

721
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,992
And they'll like it, too. I'm sure.

722
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:36,032
- I'm taking a look.
- No, I don't think,

723
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:40,119
- it's the appropriate way. Holly!
- Have you ever seen inside it?

724
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:42,754
- No.
- Exactly.

725
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,597
Hang on!

726
01:11:53,680 --> 01:11:56,672
Gloria, are you here? Holly?

727
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:59,430
Are you up there?

728
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:01,072
Shit!

729
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:07,952
Shit!

730
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:16,517
Hello?

731
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:19,554
Are you in here?

732
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:22,914
Alright, my word!

733
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:36,072
- Please be there, Lance.
- Who's Lance?

734
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:05,032
Here we are.
How does this work again?

735
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:07,998
Missed call, press green.

736
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:18,437
Hello?

737
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:28,639
This is Grace speaking. Would you like
to come out from under the bed?

738
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:30,429
Coming.

739
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:34,912
Great to see so many new faces here today.
I know some of you came a very long way,

740
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:39,954
thank you. And some old friends, Morgan.
Great result for the rugby at the weekend.

741
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:44,994
Now, down to the more serious business
of the day, our opening address.

742
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:48,999
I'd like to introduce
the Reverend Walter Goodfellow...

743
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:52,032
from the Parish of Little Wallop!

744
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:17,234
Good evening.

745
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:24,038
Good evening, Gentlemen...

746
01:14:25,188 --> 01:14:27,478
Ladies and Gentlemen.

747
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:32,474
It's an honour...

748
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:35,114
to... to deliver...

749
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:38,272
the opening address
of the convention,

750
01:14:39,532 --> 01:14:41,555
and my subject...

751
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:44,592
is "Cod's Mysterious Ways"...

752
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:48,232
"God's... God's Mysterious Ways",

753
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:53,159
I'm sorry,
I'm sure that Cod have mysterious ways.

754
01:14:55,800 --> 01:15:01,750
But it's the mysterious ways of God
that I wanted to talk about this evening.

755
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:07,353
Cod will just have to wait
for their own convention.

756
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:12,670
So! God's Mysterious Ways.

757
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:18,395
I'm so glad we can have this little chat.

758
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:23,318
- What have you done with Lance, Rosemary?
- You know, I prefer Rosie.

759
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:26,318
It takes me back to my childhood.

760
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:29,352
What have you done with Lance, Rosie?

761
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:32,392
- Who the hell's Lance?
- Yes, well,

762
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:36,712
that's the question.
You see, Lance...

763
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:41,478
Lance liked to make films.

764
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:44,558
Can you work this, dear?

765
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:51,437
<i>Showtlme.</i>

766
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:55,750
<i>Come on to Uncle Lance.</i>

767
01:15:55,800 --> 01:16:01,477
- Who the hell is this guy? I'll kill him!
- That won't be necessary, dear.

768
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:04,440
<i>My Lord.
They're just llke llttle rose petals.</i>

769
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:05,549
What?

770
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:09,593
Not the type you would have been
happy with in the end, dear.

771
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:13,753
Don't change the subject.
You have a dead man in your trunk!

772
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:17,953
No, no, he's not in my trunk, dear.
He's in his car.

773
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:22,035
And that wasn't just any man,
was it, Gloria?

774
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:25,154
That was your lover.

775
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:31,953
- That was your lover?
- Now, you've got to understand, Holly,

776
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:35,231
your mother's been very unhappy,
and Ionely. Well, you know,

777
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:40,229
your father, well, he's a busy man,
and along comes this handsome American...

778
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:45,752
with his accent and his swing,
not the type I would approve of at all.

779
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:49,879
You can't go around killing people
just because you don't approve of them.

780
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:55,392
That's what my doctors used to say.
On this point we could never agree.

781
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:59,433
Anyway, I could see,
your affair was ruining the whole family!

782
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:04,076
You can't expect me to sit back
and do nothing about that, can you?

783
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:08,272
- It has absolutely nothing to do with you!
- It has everything to do with me.

784
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:12,154
It's the least a mother
can do for her daugh...

785
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:14,794
her daughter.

786
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:20,999
That's something else
we need to have a chat about.

787
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:33,399
They'd send me photos, now and again,
the nuns.

788
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:37,118
This is one of your mother
when she was your age.

789
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:40,038
Mom, you looked gorgeous.

790
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:45,953
Aren't we forgetting
the small matter of dead bodies?

791
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:49,595
How did you know about the other bodies?

792
01:17:51,160 --> 01:17:54,994
- What other bodies?
- You didn't know about the others.

793
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:57,634
What other bodies?

794
01:17:58,280 --> 01:18:00,874
Just Mr Brown's dog.

795
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:04,514
And Mr Brown.

796
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:09,080
You killed them, too.

797
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:11,998
I did it for you, dear.

798
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:19,434
My mother...

799
01:18:20,040 --> 01:18:23,919
I've waited so long for you
to call me that.

800
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:33,838
So, what do we do now?

801
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:37,953
And when I'm asked: "Why do Vicars
always answer a question...

802
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,595
by posing another question?",
I always reply:

803
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:43,751
"Well, why shouldn't we?"

804
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:47,797
But what, in the end,
all this comes down to,

805
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:52,755
is how we deal in life
with the problems that we have to face.

806
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,788
Sometimes it's a question
of just taking action,

807
01:18:57,840 --> 01:18:59,990
of making decisions,

808
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:03,635
of involving others,
of finding your resolve,

809
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:06,558
and seeing it through.

810
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:11,790
But at other times,
it's about something much less tangible.

811
01:19:13,480 --> 01:19:18,190
Sometimes all it takes is a little grace.

812
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:38,198
A little of God's grace,

813
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:44,432
and all our problems seem to fade away.

814
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:56,757
Now, should we demand
an explanation from our Lord?

815
01:19:58,240 --> 01:20:01,118
Question his methods?

816
01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:05,074
Or should we merely enjoy the benefits?

817
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:08,872
Well,

818
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:14,230
I don't think the good Lord
wants us to question too much.

819
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:18,598
Isaiah, Chapter 55, verse 8:

820
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:22,478
"My ways are not your ways."

821
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:27,999
And I think,
what he basically means by that is:

822
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:31,678
"I'm mysterious, folks.

823
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:35,434
Live with it."

824
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:43,952
Thank you very much. Thank you.

825
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:56,072
- Jesus Christ, I can't do it.
- It's alright.

826
01:20:56,120 --> 01:21:01,148
I didn't chop him up or anything
grizzly like that. Where are you going?

827
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:04,158
- I'm not doing it.
- But I can't drive.

828
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:07,397
- I'm not getting in the car.
- But, I'm a learner.

829
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:11,558
- Officially I need someone with me.
- I think, under the circumstances...

830
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:15,195
the normal rules do not apply.
Grace, wait.

831
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:21,958
- Who is it?
- Mrs Parker.

832
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:30,512
I suppose I have to use the pond again.

833
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:32,477
Again?

834
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:38,557
No, I don't want to know. I go inside,
and you do whatever you have to do.

835
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:42,795
And I thought being an orphan
was a bad thing.

836
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:56,518
My God, he's really stiff.

837
01:21:57,200 --> 01:22:02,035
- Holly, do you have to?
- I never saw anything like this before.

838
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:03,877
My God.

839
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:05,757
My God.

840
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:09,838
My God, that's...

841
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:12,914
It's just not fair.

842
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:16,832
Other daughters get to plan weddings,

843
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:20,555
and bake cakes, and go shopping
with their mothers. And what do I do?

844
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:24,593
- Dispose of dead bodies.
- I could say the same, you know.

845
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:30,398
Shall put the kettle on?

846
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:35,998
Men were the downfall of the Jones women
for as long as there were Jones women,

847
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:39,794
and that's why you have to be careful
about the types you bring home, dear.

848
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:44,391
Wild and dangerous might be appealing now,
but believe me, you're on the same road.

849
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:48,954
- You are.
- I should get me a boyfriend like Dad?

850
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:54,632
- My God, you would, wouldn't you?
- There's nothing wrong with your father.

851
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:58,719
I knew you were a bitch to him,
but I always thought you loved him.

852
01:22:58,760 --> 01:23:01,354
I do love him.

853
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:05,035
- I do love him.
- Then what about the letch?

854
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:08,955
I'm assuming Dad doesn't know about him?

855
01:23:11,480 --> 01:23:16,679
Because I don't think he should,
I don't think he should know anything.

856
01:23:18,680 --> 01:23:21,672
- Right, Grace?
- Mom's the word, dear.

857
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:48,230
-You're awake. I brought you some tea.
- Thank you.

858
01:23:48,280 --> 01:23:53,479
Mrs Parker, last night, do you think
she might have seen something?

859
01:23:55,640 --> 01:23:57,437
No, why?

860
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:01,278
She's on her way over.

861
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:07,436
- That doesn't mean to say she saw anything.
- Who?

862
01:24:07,480 --> 01:24:11,553
- What are you talking about?
- Mrs Parker, maybe she saw something.

863
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:15,195
- She did not see anything last night.
- She saw you last night.

864
01:24:15,240 --> 01:24:17,196
- No.
- Possibly.

865
01:24:17,240 --> 01:24:20,755
- My God!
- I'll see to her.

866
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:25,032
No, you won't. You'll stay right here.
You've seen to quite enough already.

867
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:27,958
- My God.
- Just keep calm.

868
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:31,512
Mrs. Goodfellow, did I wake you?

869
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:36,553
- Actually, yes.
- I was hoping your husband would be home.

870
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:40,157
- I need to speak to him.
- No, sorry, he's away.

871
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:44,193
- He's on a three day convention.
- It's about the...

872
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:47,432
the flower arranging committee.

873
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:54,077
- you'll have to talk to him, not to me.
- Cynthia Martin...

874
01:24:54,120 --> 01:24:58,113
has been doing her level best
to undermine my leadership.

875
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,992
I believe she's planning a coup.

876
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:05,478
- A coup?
- Behind my back, yes!

877
01:25:06,920 --> 01:25:09,912
If you don't mind, I just need to sit.

878
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:16,593
Behind my back
and behind the Reverend's back as well.

879
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:21,239
It's a disgrace.
I would even go as far as saying,

880
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:26,195
it is amoral.
And knowing what I know now,

881
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:30,871
- I don't see how I can keep quiet.
- Jesus Christ, I knew it. She knows!

882
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:36,199
And when the Reverend finds out,
he will be mortified, I can assure you.

883
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:39,357
- I'm going to tell him, Mrs Goodfellow.
- Grace. Grace, no.

884
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:43,109
No matter how much damage is done,
he must be told.

885
01:25:43,160 --> 01:25:47,153
Well, I'm sure Walter will have
a quiet word with Cynthia Martin,

886
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:51,034
- and it will be all sorted out.
- But it's not just Mrs Martin.

887
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:54,675
They've all got
their sordid little agendas.

888
01:25:55,160 --> 01:26:00,075
In sixty years, Mrs. Goodfellow,
I have never known anything like it.

889
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:05,114
And in my condition, too.
It's really affecting my heart, you know?

890
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:09,153
I really do wish it didn't have to come
to this, but it does.

891
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:13,079
- Your husband must be told.
- That's quite enough, Mrs Parker.

892
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:16,351
- Out of the way, dear.
- What are you doing?

893
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:20,075
I will not have this family torn apart
after all we've been through.

894
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:24,830
- She knows! She was going to tell dad.
- About the flower arranging committee!

895
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:28,475
This has nothing to do
with anything else...

896
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:32,478
- Mrs Parker?
- Oh, dear.

897
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:37,075
- Mrs Parker, can you hear me?
- Shit, is she...

898
01:26:39,080 --> 01:26:41,753
Yes, I believe she is.

899
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:44,394
God. God.

900
01:26:45,880 --> 01:26:50,032
- She said herself, she had a dickey heart.
- I think you might have a dickey heart,

901
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:54,232
- if someone came at you with a frying pan.
- Well, it was a simple misunderstanding,

902
01:26:54,280 --> 01:26:57,909
- it could happen to anybody.
- This cannot go on, mother! It is enough.

903
01:26:57,960 --> 01:27:01,953
- I understand you're upset, dear.
- I am! I've got two dead bodies.

904
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:05,959
- One in the pond, one in the sitting room.
- You've got 3 dead bodies in the pond,

905
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,992
- you forgot...
- I do not want to know.

906
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:12,032
This has gone too far, and I mean it.

907
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:14,994
I understand.

908
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:19,915
I It's not
as if anyone's going to miss her.

909
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:24,434
Mom? Dad is back.

910
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:27,277
Hello!

911
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:31,917
Hello!

912
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:37,279
- There we are.
- Hello, sweetheart.

913
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:40,551
- Hi, Dad.
- I'll tell you, I've just had the best...

914
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:44,479
Sorry, I was saying,
I had the best convention.

915
01:27:46,040 --> 01:27:48,965
Hello, everyone. Mrs Parker.
How are you this morning?

916
01:27:49,050 --> 01:27:50,079
She's fine.

917
01:27:50,120 --> 01:27:54,079
- Darling, I thought it was three days.
- It was going to be three days, but...

918
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:58,272
- It's so lovely to see you. - Bye, Dad.
I want to hear all about it.

919
01:27:58,320 --> 01:28:01,198
Well, I delivered my sermon.

920
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:06,189
- And, how did it go?
- Very well, I even had them laughing.

921
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:10,518
But you know what was really amazing?
It was what happened afterwards.

922
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:14,553
Because I was getting praise
from everybody, from the counsel...

923
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:18,991
and my peers. Normally that would be...
But you know what I was thinking?

924
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:21,634
Why am I here?

925
01:28:22,680 --> 01:28:28,471
- Well, you've always been a deep thinker.
- When... what matters most to me...

926
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:31,114
is back home.

927
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:36,474
Oh, darling.

928
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:41,112
So,

929
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:46,999
they made love in every room in the house,
did they, Lilian and Brian?

930
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:50,392
- And they went around twice.
- Twice.

931
01:28:50,920 --> 01:28:56,517
- I think we have some catching up to do.
- No, I have to see to Mrs Parker.

932
01:28:56,560 --> 01:29:01,270
- Yes. Do you need me?
- No, it's the flower arranging committee.

933
01:29:01,320 --> 01:29:04,039
I swear, it'll be the death of her.

934
01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:09,316
Mrs Parker's sudden passing
came as a dreadful shock to us all,

935
01:29:11,160 --> 01:29:16,154
but as we well know,
God does move in mysterious ways.

936
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:22,279
Which reminds me of a keynote address,
which I deliver recently,

937
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:25,995
of which I think
Mrs Parker would have approved.

938
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:29,032
- Excellent sermon, Reverend.
- Thank you.

939
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:33,117
- Thank you, goodbye.
- It was. It was very good.

940
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:35,469
- Reverend Goodfellow.
- Mrs Martin.

941
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:39,798
I wonder if we might have a talk about
the flower arranging committee this week.

942
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:43,435
No, but perhaps next week.
I'll let you know.

943
01:29:44,306 --> 01:29:46,354
Very well.

944
01:29:49,480 --> 01:29:50,959
Goodbye.

945
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:38,274
Who is it?

946
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:41,198
- It's me.
- Come in.

947
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:58,715
I think this is for the best, don't you?

948
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:12,830
"My dearest Gloria,

949
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:16,873
it was a slice of heaven
to finally meet you, my dear.

950
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:21,393
You have made a mad old woman
a very happy mad old women.

951
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:25,675
I'll miss you and your beautiful family,

952
01:31:25,960 --> 01:31:29,839
but I'll be visiting,
just you try and stop me.

953
01:31:30,200 --> 01:31:32,953
Love to you all,
Mother."

954
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:42,792
"Dear Mother, how many months
has it been now? Two, three, four?

955
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:45,832
Yet still we talk about you all the time.

956
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:49,429
We're looking forward to your visit,
and lots planned for the whole family.

957
01:31:49,480 --> 01:31:52,597
So what's new and exciting here
in Little Wallop, you may ask.

958
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:56,792
Holly's got a very nice new boyfriend,
and she told me to tell you,

959
01:31:56,840 --> 01:31:59,912
that you'd be pleased with her choice.
He's not like the others.

960
01:31:59,960 --> 01:32:03,953
I actually believe he might be
a calming influence on her.

961
01:32:04,200 --> 01:32:09,399
And Petey's doing very well,
turning into quite a confident young man."

962
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:13,389
Which reminds me of the time,
an Englishman, an Irishman, a Scotsman,

963
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:16,910
a Vicar, a Rabbi, and a Priest all walk
into a pub, and the barman says:

964
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:18,951
"What is this, some kind of a joke?"

965
01:32:20,680 --> 01:32:24,150
"Walter's a changed man, too.
I'd even go so far to say,

966
01:32:24,200 --> 01:32:27,510
that our life here together is complete."

967
01:32:31,640 --> 01:32:37,829
"I'm by his side in all the ways he needs,
and he's by mine in all the ways I need."

968
01:32:38,120 --> 01:32:42,193
Mrs Parker felt that not enough was being
done to this part of the railings...

969
01:32:42,240 --> 01:32:46,836
inside the church whilst too much
is covered in the front porch.

970
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:52,873
"By the time you read this you'll have
arrived at your new job. Good luck,

971
01:32:52,920 --> 01:32:58,597
I hope there are no hitches, but something
tells me that you'll do fine."

972
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:24,999
Hi, darling. You remember Bob and Ted.
I'm afraid it's as we feared.

973
01:33:25,080 --> 01:33:27,275
The pond. Algae.

974
01:33:27,320 --> 01:33:31,313
- Blue-green algae.
- Which apparently is quite serious.

975
01:33:32,240 --> 01:33:35,232
- It's very serious.
- Very, very serious.

976
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:39,478
- So, we're just discussing the options.
- As I explained to Reverend Goodfellow,

977
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:43,672
your pond is in the water-table.
So the algae doesn't only effect you,

978
01:33:43,720 --> 01:33:47,679
it effects the whole village.
And the blue-green algae...

979
01:33:47,720 --> 01:33:52,396
is one of the worst you can get.
So there's really just the one option.

980
01:33:52,440 --> 01:33:56,035
Yes, as he says, really there's really...

981
01:33:56,080 --> 01:33:59,038
- just the one option.
- Which is?

982
01:33:59,080 --> 01:34:00,877
Drain it.

983
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:11,637
Drain it.

984
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:17,111
Shall I put the kettle on?

985
01:34:22,680 --> 01:34:26,070
"So, between you and us,
I'd say life if very good indeed.

986
01:34:26,120 --> 01:34:30,033
No dramas, no crisis, it just ambles along
in its quite merry way.

987
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:33,709
A couple of hiccup here and there,
of course, like the pond.

988
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:37,878
Which now they tell us needs draining.
Which is a bit of a farce,

989
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:41,913
as you could imagine,
but I'm sure we'll sort something out."
