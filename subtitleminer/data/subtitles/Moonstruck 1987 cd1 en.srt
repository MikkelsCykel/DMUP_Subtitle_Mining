1
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,864
In Napoli

2
00:00:16,936 --> 00:00:20,372
Where love is king

3
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:24,035
When boy meets girl

4
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:27,045
Here's what they say

5
00:00:31,951 --> 00:00:34,215
When the moon hits your eye

6
00:00:34,287 --> 00:00:36,721
Like a big pizza pie

7
00:00:36,789 --> 00:00:39,553
That's amore

8
00:00:41,127 --> 00:00:45,962
When the world seems to shine
like you've had too much wine

9
00:00:50,303 --> 00:00:53,670
Bells will ring
Ting-a-ling-a-ling

10
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:58,006
Then you'll sing "Vita bella"

11
00:00:59,746 --> 00:01:03,682
Hearts will play
Tippy-tippy-tay

12
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,685
Like a gay tarantella.

13
00:01:09,088 --> 00:01:13,684
When the stars make you drool
Just like pasta fazool

14
00:01:18,264 --> 00:01:22,860
When you dance down the street
with a cloud at your feet

15
00:01:22,935 --> 00:01:25,199
You're in love

16
00:01:27,273 --> 00:01:30,037
When you walk in a dream

17
00:01:30,109 --> 00:01:35,046
But you know
you're not dreaming, signore

18
00:01:36,282 --> 00:01:40,878
'Scusa me, but you see
back in old Napoli

19
00:01:40,953 --> 00:01:43,547
That's amore

21
00:02:03,609 --> 00:02:05,042
Lucky fella

22
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:53,224
He looks great.

23
00:02:53,292 --> 00:02:56,227
That AI Conti is a genius.

24
00:02:58,898 --> 00:03:00,593
I am a genius.

25
00:03:04,237 --> 00:03:07,331
If you're such a genius, how come
you can't keep track of your receipts?

26
00:03:07,407 --> 00:03:11,343
Al, how am I supposed to do
your income tax with this mess here?

27
00:03:11,411 --> 00:03:13,845
Numbers, taxes, receipts--

28
00:03:13,913 --> 00:03:18,577
I make them look better
than they did in real life.

29
00:03:18,651 --> 00:03:21,176
I'm an artistic genius.

30
00:03:21,254 --> 00:03:23,848
Then how come you got butter
on your tie?

31
00:03:25,925 --> 00:03:28,359
Give it here. God.

32
00:03:28,428 --> 00:03:31,989
You know what? I give you this.
You make good coffee.

33
00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:36,034
You're a slob,
but you make good coffee.

34
00:03:36,102 --> 00:03:37,592
Red roses.

35
00:03:38,671 --> 00:03:40,605
Very romantic.

36
00:03:42,675 --> 00:03:47,374
The guy that sends these
really knows what he's doing.

37
00:03:47,447 --> 00:03:49,381
The guy who sends those
spends a lot of money...

38
00:03:49,449 --> 00:03:52,213
on something that ends up
in the garbage.

39
00:03:52,285 --> 00:03:54,651
I'm glad everybody
ain't like you, Loretta.

40
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,486
- I'd be out of business.
- What are you talking? I love flowers.

41
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:12,003
Thanks, Carmine.

42
00:04:19,679 --> 00:04:21,670
- Are you ready?
- Hello, Bobo. How are you tonight?

43
00:04:21,747 --> 00:04:26,514
- Very good, Mr. Johnny.
- We'll both have the Ticino salad.

44
00:04:26,586 --> 00:04:29,282
- And I'll have special fish.
- Good.

45
00:04:29,355 --> 00:04:32,654
You don't want the fish. It's the oily
fish tonight. Not before the plane ride.

46
00:04:32,725 --> 00:04:35,057
Maybe you're right.

47
00:04:35,127 --> 00:04:37,027
We'll have the manicotti.

48
00:04:38,264 --> 00:04:40,027
That will be a base
for your stomach.

49
00:04:40,099 --> 00:04:42,033
You eat that oily fish,
you go up in the air...

50
00:04:42,101 --> 00:04:45,298
halfway to Sicily you'll be green
and your hands will be sweating.

51
00:04:45,371 --> 00:04:46,804
You look after me.

52
00:04:52,578 --> 00:04:54,910
- You're getting very upset.
- I'm bored with this.

53
00:04:54,981 --> 00:04:56,642
- I don't understand.
- Don't ruin the whole evening.

54
00:04:56,716 --> 00:04:59,685
- Patricia, please don't leave.
- Do you think I'm a talking doll?

55
00:04:59,752 --> 00:05:03,244
I was just making a point
about the way you said...

56
00:05:03,322 --> 00:05:06,883
-the way you stated your aspirations.
-You can kiss my aspirations, Professor!

57
00:05:09,228 --> 00:05:12,322
Very clever.
The height of cleverness.

58
00:05:14,967 --> 00:05:16,400
Waiter.

59
00:05:18,938 --> 00:05:22,499
- Yes?
- Would you do away with her dinner...

60
00:05:22,575 --> 00:05:25,339
and any evidence of her,
and bring me a big glass of vodka.

61
00:05:25,411 --> 00:05:27,345
But absolutely.

62
00:05:30,917 --> 00:05:34,614
A man who can't control his woman
is funny.

63
00:05:36,255 --> 00:05:39,486
- She was too young for him.
- What's the matter, Uncle Bobo?

64
00:05:39,559 --> 00:05:42,858
Tonight Mr. Johnny's going
to propose marriage.

65
00:05:42,929 --> 00:05:45,523
- How do you know that?
- He arranged it with me.

66
00:05:45,598 --> 00:05:49,864
When he asks her, he's gonna wave.
Then I serve the champagne.

67
00:05:52,104 --> 00:05:55,198
Good bachelor customer
for 20 years.

68
00:06:07,553 --> 00:06:10,579
- How's things?
- Fine, Bobo. We'll have the check.

69
00:06:10,656 --> 00:06:12,089
No, l--

70
00:06:13,893 --> 00:06:16,657
- I want to see the dessert cart.
- Very good.

71
00:06:16,729 --> 00:06:19,926
- You never have dessert.
- Never is a long time.

72
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,638
What's the matter with you?

73
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:39,984
My scalp is not getting
enough blood sometimes.

74
00:06:41,053 --> 00:06:43,521
- Have some dessert.
- I shouldn't.

75
00:06:43,589 --> 00:06:46,080
- Will you marry me?
- What?

76
00:06:51,263 --> 00:06:55,632
- Bobo, take the cart away.
- Very good, Miss Loretta.

77
00:06:55,701 --> 00:06:57,931
- Are you proposing marriage to me?
- Yes.

78
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:02,803
All right, you know I was married
and that my husband died...

79
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:05,969
but what you don't know
is I think he and I had bad luck.

80
00:07:06,045 --> 00:07:08,980
- What do you mean?
- We got married at City Hall.

81
00:07:09,048 --> 00:07:12,279
-It gave bad luck to the whole marriage.
-I don't understand.

82
00:07:12,351 --> 00:07:15,980
Right from the start,
we didn't do it right.

83
00:07:16,055 --> 00:07:19,115
- Could you kneel down?
- On the floor?

84
00:07:19,191 --> 00:07:20,624
Yeah.

85
00:07:20,693 --> 00:07:22,718
- This is a good suit.
- I know that.

86
00:07:22,795 --> 00:07:25,491
I helped you pick it out.
It came with two pairs of pants.

87
00:07:25,564 --> 00:07:30,228
It's for luck. A man proposes marriage
to a woman, he should kneel down.

88
00:07:43,883 --> 00:07:46,477
She's got him on his knees.
He's ruining his suit.

89
00:07:50,923 --> 00:07:52,788
Is that man praying?

90
00:07:53,893 --> 00:07:56,623
- So--
- Where's the ring?

91
00:07:58,531 --> 00:07:59,964
The ring.

92
00:08:00,032 --> 00:08:01,966
A ring. That's right.

93
00:08:02,034 --> 00:08:04,969
I would have sprung for the ring
if it was me.

94
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:09,599
- You can use your pinkie ring.
- I like this ring.

95
00:08:09,675 --> 00:08:13,577
You propose marriage to a woman,
you should offer her an engagement ring.

96
00:08:26,892 --> 00:08:28,723
Loretta Castorini Clark...

97
00:08:29,895 --> 00:08:33,126
on my knees,
in front of all these people...

98
00:08:35,234 --> 00:08:36,701
will you marry me?

99
00:08:36,769 --> 00:08:40,500
Yes, John Anthony Cammareri.

100
00:08:40,573 --> 00:08:43,133
I will marry you.
I will be your wife.

101
00:09:02,728 --> 00:09:05,891
- The check!
- Right away, Mr. Johnny.

102
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:19,644
What about the wedding?

103
00:09:22,548 --> 00:09:24,482
My mother is dying.

104
00:09:25,951 --> 00:09:28,647
When she's dead,
I'll come back and we'll get married.

105
00:09:28,721 --> 00:09:30,154
How near death is she?

106
00:09:31,724 --> 00:09:33,954
A week. Two weeks.

107
00:09:34,026 --> 00:09:37,086
- No more.
- Let's set a date. How about a month?

108
00:09:37,163 --> 00:09:39,324
Must it be so definite?

109
00:09:39,398 --> 00:09:42,697
Can we just say
we'll be married when I get back?

110
00:09:42,768 --> 00:09:44,292
Where?
At the City Hall? No.

111
00:09:45,638 --> 00:09:47,469
My mother is dying.

112
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,667
I want a whole wedding
or we'll have bad luck.

113
00:09:49,742 --> 00:09:53,143
For a whole wedding to be planned,
you gotta set a date.

114
00:09:53,212 --> 00:09:55,476
All right. A month.

115
00:09:55,548 --> 00:09:57,675
- A month from today.
- In a month.

116
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,848
- From today.
- I'll take care of the whole thing.

117
00:10:04,924 --> 00:10:06,448
All you gotta do is show up.

118
00:10:15,267 --> 00:10:16,700
Come on.

119
00:10:19,605 --> 00:10:22,438
- Call me when you get in.
- I'll call you from Mama's house.

120
00:10:22,508 --> 00:10:25,375
You make me very happy.

121
00:10:25,444 --> 00:10:27,912
There's one thing about this wedding
I want you to do.

122
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:31,381
I want you to call this number.

123
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:33,850
It's a business number.
You ask for Ronny.

124
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:36,581
- Invite him to the wedding.
- Who is it?

125
00:10:36,655 --> 00:10:40,614
- It's my younger brother.
- You got a brother?

126
00:10:40,693 --> 00:10:43,890
We haven't spoken in five years.

127
00:10:43,963 --> 00:10:45,555
There was some bad blood.

128
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,826
I want you to call him
and invite him to the wedding.

129
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,333
- Will you do it?
- Sure.

130
00:10:49,401 --> 00:10:51,335
International Flight 604
for Rome...

131
00:10:51,403 --> 00:10:55,430
with connections to Palermo
is now boarding at Gate 43.

132
00:10:55,507 --> 00:10:57,441
I gotta go.

133
00:10:57,509 --> 00:10:59,739
You got your ticket?

134
00:11:02,748 --> 00:11:06,149
Here, I got you these:
gum and cough drops.

135
00:11:06,218 --> 00:11:08,516
- Gum opens your ears when you chew it.
- Yeah.

136
00:11:08,587 --> 00:11:10,020
I gotta go.

137
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,536
This is the last call
for lnternational Flight 604 for Rome.

138
00:11:31,277 --> 00:11:34,713
- You have someone on that plane?
- Yeah, my fiance.

139
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:39,046
I put a curse on that plane.
My sister is on that plane.

140
00:11:39,118 --> 00:11:42,383
I put a curse on that plane
that it's gonna explode...

141
00:11:42,454 --> 00:11:45,389
burn on fire
and fall into the sea.

142
00:11:45,457 --> 00:11:49,052
Fifty years ago,
she stole a man from me.

143
00:11:51,463 --> 00:11:54,830
Today she tells me
that she never loved him...

144
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,835
that she took him
to be strong on me.

145
00:11:57,903 --> 00:11:59,996
Now she's going back to Sicily.

146
00:12:02,241 --> 00:12:06,837
I cursed her that the green
Atlantic water should swallow her up!

147
00:12:06,912 --> 00:12:09,005
I don't believe in curses.

148
00:12:09,081 --> 00:12:11,345
Neither do l.

149
00:12:36,508 --> 00:12:38,442
- Mr. Johnny's, right?
- Yeah.

150
00:12:41,613 --> 00:12:43,706
Good night.
The key's in it.

151
00:12:52,725 --> 00:12:55,592
I've heard that song before.

152
00:12:55,661 --> 00:12:59,495
What are you talking about?
I've seen the way you look at her.

153
00:12:59,565 --> 00:13:01,499
- It isn't right.
- How do I look at her?

154
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,501
- Can I help you?
- A spumante.

155
00:13:03,569 --> 00:13:06,231
- So how do I look at her?
- Like a wolf.

156
00:13:12,244 --> 00:13:16,340
Never seen a wolf in your life.
That's $11.99.

157
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:20,351
I seen the wolf in everybody
I ever met...

158
00:13:20,419 --> 00:13:22,387
and I see a wolf in you.

159
00:13:24,423 --> 00:13:26,357
That makes 20.
Thanks.

160
00:13:26,425 --> 00:13:28,359
- Have a nice night.
- You too.

161
00:13:28,427 --> 00:13:30,691
- You know what I see in you?
- What?

162
00:13:30,763 --> 00:13:34,290
- The girl I married.
- Come on.

163
00:13:34,366 --> 00:13:36,698
Good night.

164
00:14:15,507 --> 00:14:17,441
Hi, guys.

165
00:14:17,509 --> 00:14:21,172
Sweethearts, how are you?
Guess what happened to me today.

166
00:14:32,091 --> 00:14:34,787
Hey, how long must I wait?

167
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,350
Come here!

168
00:14:40,966 --> 00:14:42,695
- Hi, Pop.
- Hi.

169
00:14:42,768 --> 00:14:45,134
- Where's Ma?
- In bed.

170
00:14:45,204 --> 00:14:49,197
- You're not sleeping?
- I can't sleep anymore.

171
00:14:49,274 --> 00:14:51,208
It's too much like death.

172
00:14:52,711 --> 00:14:55,805
Pop, I got news.

173
00:14:55,881 --> 00:14:57,405
All right.

174
00:14:57,483 --> 00:15:02,648
- Let's go into the kitchen.
- Once again I start to pray

175
00:15:02,721 --> 00:15:05,986
Let it please be him

176
00:15:06,058 --> 00:15:10,290
Oh, dear God, it must be him

177
00:15:10,362 --> 00:15:12,990
It must be him

178
00:15:13,065 --> 00:15:16,159
Or I shall die

179
00:15:49,067 --> 00:15:51,035
You look tired, Pop.

180
00:15:53,872 --> 00:15:55,362
What's your news?

181
00:15:58,210 --> 00:15:59,677
I'm getting married.

182
00:15:59,745 --> 00:16:02,145
- Again?
- Yeah.

183
00:16:02,214 --> 00:16:04,148
You did this once before.
It didn't work out.

184
00:16:04,216 --> 00:16:06,150
- The guy died.
- What killed him?

185
00:16:06,218 --> 00:16:08,880
- He got hit by a bus.
- No. Bad luck.

186
00:16:08,954 --> 00:16:11,479
Your mother and I were married
52 years. Nobody died.

187
00:16:11,557 --> 00:16:13,650
You were married two years,
somebody's dead.

188
00:16:13,725 --> 00:16:16,387
Don't get married again.
It don't work out for you.

189
00:16:16,461 --> 00:16:19,589
- Who's the man?
- Johnny Cammareri.

190
00:16:22,234 --> 00:16:25,635
He's a big baby. And why
isn't he here telling me this?

191
00:16:25,704 --> 00:16:27,831
He's flying to Sicily.
His mother is dying.

192
00:16:27,906 --> 00:16:32,172
More bad luck. I don't like his face.
I don't like his lips.

193
00:16:32,244 --> 00:16:34,235
When he smiles, I can't see his teeth.
What is he hiding?

194
00:16:34,313 --> 00:16:36,008
- When are you gonna do it?
- In a month.

195
00:16:36,081 --> 00:16:38,311
- I won't come.
- You gotta give me away.

196
00:16:38,383 --> 00:16:41,181
- I didn't give you away the first time.
- And I had bad luck!

197
00:16:41,253 --> 00:16:44,188
Maybe if you gave me away...

198
00:16:44,256 --> 00:16:46,349
and I got married in a church
in a wedding dress...

199
00:16:46,425 --> 00:16:49,690
instead of down at the City Hall
with strangers outside the door...

200
00:16:49,761 --> 00:16:52,252
then maybe I wouldn't have had
the bad luck I had.

201
00:16:53,699 --> 00:16:55,189
Maybe.

202
00:16:55,267 --> 00:16:58,634
I had no reception,
no wedding cake, no nothing.

203
00:17:00,205 --> 00:17:03,106
Johnny got down on his knees
and proposed to me at the Grand Ticino.

204
00:17:03,175 --> 00:17:04,972
- He did?
- Yeah.

205
00:17:05,043 --> 00:17:07,944
- That don't sound like Johnny.
- Well--

206
00:17:09,014 --> 00:17:11,380
- Where's the ring?
- Here.

207
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:14,078
It looks stupid.
It's a pinky ring.

208
00:17:14,152 --> 00:17:16,552
- It's a man's ring.
- It's temporary!

209
00:17:16,622 --> 00:17:19,523
Everything is temporary!
That don't excuse nothing!

210
00:17:19,591 --> 00:17:21,354
You're coming?

211
00:17:23,729 --> 00:17:26,323
Let's go tell your mother.

212
00:17:33,338 --> 00:17:34,771
Rose.

213
00:17:42,414 --> 00:17:44,177
Who's dead?

214
00:17:44,249 --> 00:17:46,114
Nobody.

215
00:17:46,184 --> 00:17:48,516
- Loretta's getting married.
- Again?

216
00:17:48,587 --> 00:17:50,851
- Yeah.
- Johnny Cammareri.

217
00:17:50,922 --> 00:17:53,652
- I don't like him.
- You're not gonna marry him, Cosmo.

218
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:57,124
- Do you love him?
- No.

219
00:17:57,195 --> 00:17:59,789
Good. When you love them,
they drive you crazy...

220
00:17:59,865 --> 00:18:02,129
'cause they know they can.

221
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,293
- But you like him?
- Yeah.

222
00:18:04,369 --> 00:18:05,961
He's a sweet man, Ma.

223
00:18:06,038 --> 00:18:09,804
This time I'm gonna get married
in a church and have a big reception.

224
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:11,809
- Who's gonna pay for that?
- Pop.

225
00:18:11,877 --> 00:18:13,811
What?

226
00:18:13,879 --> 00:18:15,471
Father of the bride pays.

227
00:18:15,547 --> 00:18:17,071
I have no money.

228
00:18:17,149 --> 00:18:21,279
- You're rich. You're just cheap.
- I don't want to pay for nothing.

229
00:18:21,353 --> 00:18:23,821
It's your duty as my father
to pay for the wedding.

230
00:18:23,889 --> 00:18:25,982
I won't pay for nothing.

231
00:18:26,058 --> 00:18:27,992
He didn't used to be cheap.

232
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:31,359
He thinks if he holds onto his money,
he will never die.

233
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:33,330
What's done is done

234
00:18:33,398 --> 00:18:35,832
And I tell myself
don't be a fool

235
00:18:35,901 --> 00:18:39,997
Now he'll play that damn record
and won't touch me when he comes to bed.

236
00:18:40,072 --> 00:18:42,165
Have a lot of fun

237
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,573
It's easy when you play it cool

238
00:18:55,687 --> 00:18:59,282
Look at that old man.
How many dogs has he got?

239
00:19:03,695 --> 00:19:09,224
- Keep your dogs off my lawn.
- Come on.

240
00:19:22,047 --> 00:19:24,572
Don't do that.
She's asleep.

241
00:19:24,649 --> 00:19:28,244
- She's asleep.
- Look all the flowers on Foncica.

242
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,754
My brother sent her a blue flower.

243
00:19:30,822 --> 00:19:34,849
I can only see things in my house.

244
00:19:34,926 --> 00:19:38,828
Things in my house are very bad.
I don't know what to advise my son.

245
00:19:38,897 --> 00:19:42,162
I think he should pay
for the wedding...

246
00:19:42,234 --> 00:19:44,259
but it's important
that he don't look ridiculous.

247
00:19:44,336 --> 00:19:48,238
- Why don't you talk to him?
- I will.

248
00:19:48,306 --> 00:19:50,706
But I must find the right moment.

249
00:19:50,776 --> 00:19:52,710
See that bella luna last night?

250
00:19:57,582 --> 00:20:02,349
The moon brings the woman
to the man.

251
00:21:01,913 --> 00:21:04,848
Upstairs.
Everybody upstairs.

252
00:21:06,985 --> 00:21:08,509
Come on.

253
00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:37,214
- Will you live here?
- No.

254
00:21:37,282 --> 00:21:40,046
- Why not?
- Pop don't like Johnny.

255
00:21:41,286 --> 00:21:43,220
We'll sell the house.

256
00:21:43,288 --> 00:21:45,722
I got married before,
you didn't sell.

257
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:47,553
Grandma was still alive.

258
00:21:47,626 --> 00:21:52,825
Chiro was still home going to school.
Now he's married, gone to Florida.

259
00:21:52,898 --> 00:21:55,492
If you and Johnny moved in
and had a baby--

260
00:21:55,567 --> 00:21:58,331
Ma, I'm 37 years old.

261
00:21:58,403 --> 00:21:59,836
What's 37?

262
00:21:59,905 --> 00:22:03,341
I didn't have Chiro
till after I was 37.

263
00:22:03,408 --> 00:22:05,672
It ain't over till it's over.

264
00:22:07,913 --> 00:22:11,007
Johnny's got a big apartment.
We'll move in there.

265
00:22:11,082 --> 00:22:13,175
So we'll sell the house.

266
00:22:13,251 --> 00:22:16,516
You know-- What-- I want to live here.
I love the house.

267
00:22:16,588 --> 00:22:19,022
Pop don't like Johnny.

268
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:20,523
No, he don't.

269
00:22:24,329 --> 00:22:25,762
I'll get it.

270
00:22:29,434 --> 00:22:30,867
Hello?

271
00:22:33,271 --> 00:22:36,206
Yeah, this is Loretta Castorini.

272
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:42,746
Hello, operator?

273
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:49,216
- Yeah.
- Yes. Shh! It's me.

274
00:22:50,622 --> 00:22:52,783
I'm calling from the death bed
of my mother.

275
00:22:52,857 --> 00:22:55,052
Yeah, how was your plane ride?

276
00:22:55,126 --> 00:22:58,653
The waitresses were very nice.

277
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:02,427
- My mother is slipping away.
- How long do I have to wait?

278
00:23:11,509 --> 00:23:15,206
-I can't talk long.
-Did you tell her we're getting married?

279
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:20,809
No, not yet. I'm waiting
till a moment when she's peaceful.

280
00:23:20,885 --> 00:23:23,046
Well, don't wait till she's dead.

281
00:23:23,121 --> 00:23:24,611
Have you called my brother?

282
00:23:24,689 --> 00:23:27,522
No. I'm sorry. Not yet.
I forgot.

283
00:23:27,592 --> 00:23:30,425
- Will you do it today?
- Yes.

284
00:23:30,495 --> 00:23:33,521
Make sure he comes to the wedding.

285
00:23:33,598 --> 00:23:36,692
Five years is too long
for bad blood between brothers.

286
00:23:36,768 --> 00:23:39,703
Nothing can replace the family.

287
00:23:41,272 --> 00:23:42,739
I can see that now.

288
00:23:44,909 --> 00:23:46,672
Loretta, are you there?

289
00:23:47,946 --> 00:23:50,210
I'm sorry.
I'll do it today.

290
00:23:50,281 --> 00:23:52,442
And listen, Johnny.

291
00:23:52,517 --> 00:23:56,317
- Call me after you tell her.
- All right.

292
00:23:56,388 --> 00:24:01,291
And don't stand directly under the sun.
You got a hat. Use your hat.

293
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:05,159
I got my hat.
All right. Bye.

294
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:06,720
All right. Bye-bye.

295
00:24:08,066 --> 00:24:10,330
What did I do with that card?

296
00:24:11,536 --> 00:24:13,595
How's the mother?

297
00:24:13,672 --> 00:24:16,436
She's dying, but I could still
hear her big mouth.

298
00:24:39,397 --> 00:24:41,297
He didn't tell her.

299
00:24:41,366 --> 00:24:44,699
You know,
the woman makes him crazy.

300
00:24:44,769 --> 00:24:46,532
Now who you calling?

301
00:24:51,543 --> 00:24:52,976
Cammareri's.

302
00:24:53,044 --> 00:24:56,172
Is Ronny Cammareri there, please?

303
00:24:56,247 --> 00:24:57,680
Hold on.

304
00:24:57,749 --> 00:24:59,717
Ronny, the phone!

305
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,517
Yeah, this is Ronny.

306
00:25:03,588 --> 00:25:07,820
Yeah, I'm calling for your brother.

307
00:25:07,892 --> 00:25:10,656
He's getting married,
and he would like it if you would come.

308
00:25:10,729 --> 00:25:12,390
Why didn't he call himself?

309
00:25:12,464 --> 00:25:14,864
- He's in Palermo.
- What's wrong can never be made right.

310
00:25:14,933 --> 00:25:17,766
Look, just let me come
and talk--

311
00:25:17,836 --> 00:25:21,169
Talk to you! Animal!

312
00:25:21,239 --> 00:25:22,729
What an animal!

313
00:25:45,096 --> 00:25:47,030
Thanks, Mrs. Fugocci.

314
00:25:47,098 --> 00:25:49,862
Here you go.
Bye. See you tomorrow.

315
00:25:49,934 --> 00:25:51,868
- Bye.
- Come on, honey.

316
00:25:51,936 --> 00:25:54,928
- Is Ronny Cammareri here?
- He's down at the ovens.

317
00:25:55,006 --> 00:25:57,668
- What do you want?
- I want to talk to him.

318
00:26:08,219 --> 00:26:09,652
This way.

319
00:26:16,728 --> 00:26:19,162
- What?
- Somebody here to see Ronny.

320
00:26:20,832 --> 00:26:23,733
Somebody wants to see you!

321
00:26:43,822 --> 00:26:47,519
- You come for my brother Johnny?
- Yeah.

322
00:26:47,592 --> 00:26:49,492
Why?

323
00:26:49,561 --> 00:26:51,552
We're gonna get married.

324
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,601
- You're gonna marry my brother Johnny?
- Yeah.

325
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:00,297
Would you like to go someplace
so we could talk--

326
00:27:00,371 --> 00:27:02,931
- I have no life.
- Excuse me?

327
00:27:05,543 --> 00:27:08,011
My brother Johnny
took my life from me.

328
00:27:09,547 --> 00:27:11,208
I don't understand you.

329
00:27:11,282 --> 00:27:15,878
And now he's getting married.
He has his.

330
00:27:17,755 --> 00:27:21,316
He's getting his,
and he wants me to come.

331
00:27:22,861 --> 00:27:24,294
What is life?

332
00:27:24,362 --> 00:27:28,025
- I didn't come here to upset you.
- They say bread is life.

333
00:27:29,234 --> 00:27:32,897
And I bake bread, bread, bread.

334
00:27:32,971 --> 00:27:36,407
I sweat
and shovel this stinking dough...

335
00:27:36,474 --> 00:27:39,034
in and out of this hot hole
in the wall...

336
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:43,911
and I should be so happy, huh, sweetie?

337
00:27:43,982 --> 00:27:46,542
You want me to come to the wedding
of my brother Johnny?

338
00:27:49,854 --> 00:27:51,481
Where's my wedding?

339
00:27:52,857 --> 00:27:56,623
Chrissy, bring me the big knife
over by the wall.

340
00:27:59,163 --> 00:28:00,858
I'm gonna cut my throat!

341
00:28:00,932 --> 00:28:03,423
Maybe I should come back
another time.

342
00:28:03,501 --> 00:28:06,163
No, I want you to see this.
I want you...

343
00:28:06,237 --> 00:28:08,705
to watch me kill myself
so you can tell my brother Johnny...

344
00:28:08,773 --> 00:28:11,606
on his wedding day, okay?

345
00:28:13,745 --> 00:28:15,406
I won't do it!

346
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,210
She won't do it.
Do you know about me?

347
00:28:18,283 --> 00:28:20,080
- Mr. Cammareri--
- What?

348
00:28:25,356 --> 00:28:27,381
Okay.

349
00:28:27,458 --> 00:28:33,055
Nothing is anybody's fault,
but things happen.

350
00:28:33,131 --> 00:28:34,564
Look.

351
00:28:37,502 --> 00:28:40,665
This wood is fake.

352
00:28:40,738 --> 00:28:43,263
Five years ago,
I was engaged to be married...

353
00:28:43,341 --> 00:28:46,799
and Johnny came in here
and ordered bread from me.

354
00:28:46,878 --> 00:28:48,846
I said, "Okay, some bread."

355
00:28:48,913 --> 00:28:52,212
And I put my hand in the slicer...

356
00:28:52,283 --> 00:28:55,411
and it got caught
'cause I wasn't paying attention.

357
00:28:55,486 --> 00:28:58,887
The slicer chewed off my hand.

358
00:28:58,957 --> 00:29:02,290
It's funny, 'cause when my fiance
found out about it...

359
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:06,194
when she found out I had been maimed,
she left me for another man.

360
00:29:07,999 --> 00:29:09,967
That's the bad blood
between you and Johnny?

361
00:29:10,034 --> 00:29:11,763
Yes, that's it.

362
00:29:11,836 --> 00:29:14,066
But that's not Johnny's fault.

363
00:29:16,441 --> 00:29:19,933
I don't care!
I ain't no freaking monument to justice!

364
00:29:20,011 --> 00:29:23,879
I lost my hand!
I lost my bride!

365
00:29:23,948 --> 00:29:26,644
Johnny has his hand!
Johnny has his bride!

366
00:29:26,718 --> 00:29:29,778
You want me to take my heartbreak,
put it away and forget it?

367
00:29:42,433 --> 00:29:45,095
Is it just a matter of time...

368
00:29:45,169 --> 00:29:47,603
before a man opens his eyes...

369
00:29:49,307 --> 00:29:51,502
and gives up his one...

370
00:29:53,978 --> 00:29:58,938
dream of happiness?

371
00:30:07,158 --> 00:30:08,591
Maybe.

372
00:30:29,013 --> 00:30:32,107
This is the most tormented man
I have ever known.

373
00:30:32,183 --> 00:30:33,650
I'm in love with this man...

374
00:30:33,718 --> 00:30:36,881
but he doesn't know that.

375
00:30:36,954 --> 00:30:39,548
I never told him,
'cause he could never love anybody...

376
00:30:39,624 --> 00:30:41,922
since he lost his hand
and his girl.

377
00:30:48,533 --> 00:30:50,467
Where do you live?

378
00:30:53,738 --> 00:30:55,171
Upstairs.

379
00:30:56,374 --> 00:30:58,308
Can we just talk?

380
00:31:23,668 --> 00:31:26,364
What are we painting here,
the Sistine Chapel?

381
00:31:26,437 --> 00:31:29,668
We should have been plumbers
like Castorini.

382
00:31:46,791 --> 00:31:48,224
What do you think?

383
00:31:54,732 --> 00:31:56,495
Ten thousand eight hundred dollars.

384
00:31:56,567 --> 00:31:59,001
That seems like a lot.

385
00:32:04,041 --> 00:32:05,474
Look...

386
00:32:05,543 --> 00:32:07,841
there are three kinds of pipe.

387
00:32:07,912 --> 00:32:11,006
There's the kind of pipe you have,
which is garbage.

388
00:32:11,082 --> 00:32:13,016
You can see
where that's gotten you.

389
00:32:13,084 --> 00:32:15,848
Then there's bronze,
which is very good.

390
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,512
Unless something goes wrong...

391
00:32:17,588 --> 00:32:20,785
and something always goes wrong.

392
00:32:20,858 --> 00:32:26,023
Then there's copper,
which is the only pipe I use.

393
00:32:26,097 --> 00:32:31,160
It costs money
because it saves money.

394
00:32:34,272 --> 00:32:39,869
I think we should follow
Mr. Castorini's advice.

395
00:32:39,944 --> 00:32:41,377
Yeah.

396
00:32:50,454 --> 00:32:53,651
And then there's copper...

397
00:32:53,724 --> 00:32:56,659
which is the only pipe I use.

398
00:32:56,727 --> 00:32:58,820
It costs money.

399
00:32:58,896 --> 00:33:01,160
It costs money because...

400
00:33:01,232 --> 00:33:03,496
it saves money.

401
00:33:03,568 --> 00:33:09,165
- What did they say?
- The man understood me.

402
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:13,142
The woman wanted to be cheap,
but the man saw I was right.

403
00:33:14,478 --> 00:33:18,608
You have such a head for knowing.
You know everything.

404
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:28,650
I brought you something.

405
00:33:28,726 --> 00:33:31,024
It's a present.

406
00:33:39,837 --> 00:33:42,704
Oh, my God.

407
00:33:42,773 --> 00:33:46,265
They're little birds and stars.

408
00:33:48,112 --> 00:33:52,105
Birds fly to the stars I guess.

409
00:34:35,526 --> 00:34:38,859
- What's that smell?
- I'm making you a steak.

410
00:34:38,929 --> 00:34:41,329
- I don't want it.
- You'll eat it.

411
00:34:42,433 --> 00:34:44,196
I like it well-done!

412
00:34:44,268 --> 00:34:48,136
You'll eat this one bloody
to feed your blood.

413
00:35:03,554 --> 00:35:05,249
This is good.

414
00:35:08,392 --> 00:35:10,986
- Where'd Johnny find you?
- He knew my husband who died.

415
00:35:11,062 --> 00:35:12,495
- How'd he die?
- A bus hit him.

416
00:35:12,563 --> 00:35:14,656
- Fast?
- Instantaneous.

417
00:35:14,732 --> 00:35:17,860
- When'd you get engaged?
- Yesterday.

418
00:35:17,935 --> 00:35:23,134
So five years ago you got your hand
cut off and your woman left you.

419
00:35:23,207 --> 00:35:24,868
- No woman since then?
- No.

420
00:35:25,943 --> 00:35:31,006
- Stupid.
- When your husband get hit?

421
00:35:31,082 --> 00:35:33,016
Seven years ago.

422
00:35:33,084 --> 00:35:35,575
- How many men since then?
- Just Johnny.

423
00:35:36,687 --> 00:35:39,178
- Stupid yourself.
- Unlucky.

424
00:35:39,256 --> 00:35:41,520
- I've not been lucky.
- I don't care about luck.

425
00:35:41,592 --> 00:35:45,858
You understand me?
It ain't that.

426
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:50,367
What's the matter with you? You think
you're the only one who shed a tear?

427
00:35:50,434 --> 00:35:52,061
Why are you talking to me?

428
00:35:58,709 --> 00:36:01,644
You got any whiskey? How about
you get me a glass of whiskey?

429
00:36:19,397 --> 00:36:20,989
I'll call you later.

430
00:36:44,922 --> 00:36:48,688
- She was right to leave me.
- You think so?

431
00:36:48,759 --> 00:36:53,287
- Yeah.
- You really are stupid.

432
00:36:53,364 --> 00:36:56,800
You don't know nothing about it.

433
00:36:59,203 --> 00:37:03,299
Look, I was raised
that a girl gets married young.

434
00:37:03,374 --> 00:37:04,966
I held out for love.

435
00:37:05,042 --> 00:37:07,135
I got married when I was 28.

436
00:37:07,211 --> 00:37:10,612
I met a man. I loved him.
I married him.

437
00:37:10,681 --> 00:37:13,377
He wanted to have a baby right away.
I said we should wait.

438
00:37:13,451 --> 00:37:15,976
Then he gets hit by a bus.

439
00:37:16,053 --> 00:37:19,045
What do I got?
No man, no baby, no nothing.

440
00:37:19,123 --> 00:37:22,650
How did I know that man
was a gift I couldn't keep.

441
00:37:22,726 --> 00:37:24,819
My one chance at happiness.

442
00:37:24,895 --> 00:37:28,160
You tell me the story, and you
act like you know what it means...

443
00:37:28,232 --> 00:37:30,792
but I can see what
the true story is and you can't.

444
00:37:30,868 --> 00:37:33,496
That woman didn't leave you, okay?

445
00:37:33,571 --> 00:37:37,337
You can't see what you are,
and I see everything. You're a wolf.

446
00:37:38,742 --> 00:37:41,006
- I'm a wolf?
- Yeah.

447
00:37:41,078 --> 00:37:45,845
The big part of you has no words,
and it's a wolf.

448
00:37:45,916 --> 00:37:48,680
That woman was a trap for you. She
caught you, and you couldn't get away...

449
00:37:48,752 --> 00:37:51,448
so you chewed off your own foot.

450
00:37:51,522 --> 00:37:53,615
That was the price
you had to pay for your freedom.

451
00:37:53,691 --> 00:37:55,625
Johnny had nothing to do with it.

452
00:37:55,693 --> 00:37:58,025
You did what you had to do
between you and you.

453
00:37:58,095 --> 00:38:00,086
And now you're afraid...

454
00:38:00,164 --> 00:38:02,029
because you know
the big part of you is a wolf...

455
00:38:02,099 --> 00:38:04,294
that has the courage
to bite off its own hand...

456
00:38:04,368 --> 00:38:06,802
to save itself from the trap
of the wrong love.

457
00:38:06,871 --> 00:38:10,329
That's why there's been no woman
since that wrong woman. Okay?

458
00:38:10,407 --> 00:38:12,637
You're scared to death
of what the wolf will do...

459
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:15,144
- if you make that mistake again.
- What are you doing?

460
00:38:15,212 --> 00:38:17,510
- I'm telling you your life.
- Stop it.

461
00:38:17,581 --> 00:38:19,776
Why are you marrying Johnny?
He's a fool!

462
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:22,011
Because I have no luck.

463
00:38:23,554 --> 00:38:27,490
He made me look the wrong way,
and I cut off my hand!

464
00:38:27,558 --> 00:38:30,152
He could make you look the wrong way.
You could lose your whole head!

465
00:38:30,227 --> 00:38:32,195
I'm looking where I have to
to become a bride!

466
00:38:32,263 --> 00:38:36,359
- A bride without a head!
- A wolf without a foot!

467
00:38:51,415 --> 00:38:53,110
Wait a minute!

468
00:39:05,696 --> 00:39:07,425
What are you doing?

469
00:39:07,498 --> 00:39:08,931
Son of a bitch!

470
00:39:08,999 --> 00:39:11,934
Where are you taking me?

471
00:39:12,002 --> 00:39:13,435
To the bed.

472
00:39:14,538 --> 00:39:17,132
Oh, God.
Okay, I don't care.

473
00:39:17,207 --> 00:39:19,471
Take me to the bed.

474
00:39:19,543 --> 00:39:22,569
- I don't care about anything.
- I don't believe this is happening.

475
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:28,643
- I was dead.
- Me too.

476
00:39:33,591 --> 00:39:35,821
- What about Johnny?
- You're mad at him.

477
00:39:35,893 --> 00:39:38,726
Take your revenge
out on me.

478
00:39:38,796 --> 00:39:40,730
Leave nothing left
for him to marry.

479
00:39:40,798 --> 00:39:43,824
Leave nothing
but the skin over my bones.

480
00:39:43,901 --> 00:39:47,166
All right.
There will be nothing left.

481
00:40:03,854 --> 00:40:05,185
Let's eat while it's hot.

482
00:40:05,255 --> 00:40:07,246
Where's Loretta?
We're eating without her?

483
00:40:07,324 --> 00:40:10,452
- She must be eating out.
- She don't know what she's missing.

484
00:40:10,527 --> 00:40:12,688
It's not like her not to call.

485
00:40:12,763 --> 00:40:16,529
She's got a lot on her mind.
We can talk about her, right?

486
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:19,899
- Everybody knows she's getting married.
- I don't want to talk about it.

487
00:40:23,374 --> 00:40:26,969
I think it's a great idea
and about time.

488
00:40:27,044 --> 00:40:30,536
What's she gonna do with the rest
of her life if she don't get married?

489
00:40:30,614 --> 00:40:33,344
I don't want to talk about it!

490
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:37,144
My father needs another plate.

491
00:40:40,991 --> 00:40:44,483
Many years ago,
when they told me...

492
00:40:44,561 --> 00:40:47,052
you were marrying my sister...

493
00:40:47,131 --> 00:40:48,723
I was happy.

494
00:40:48,799 --> 00:40:50,323
When I told Rose...

495
00:40:50,401 --> 00:40:52,096
that I was marrying Rita...

496
00:40:52,169 --> 00:40:54,034
she was happy.

497
00:40:54,104 --> 00:40:56,504
Marriage is happy news, right?

498
00:40:58,742 --> 00:41:00,733
Rose, pass the wine.

499
00:41:02,846 --> 00:41:06,304
I never seen anybody so in love...

500
00:41:06,383 --> 00:41:09,181
Iike Cosmo was back then.

501
00:41:09,253 --> 00:41:12,620
He'd stand outside the house all day
looking in the windows.

502
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:16,956
I never told you this
'cause it's not really a story...

503
00:41:17,027 --> 00:41:20,485
but one time I woke up
in the middle of the night...

504
00:41:20,564 --> 00:41:23,158
'cause of this bright light
in my face...

505
00:41:23,233 --> 00:41:24,860
Iike a flashlight.

506
00:41:24,935 --> 00:41:26,800
I couldn't think what it was.

507
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:31,705
I looked out the window,
and it was the moon...

508
00:41:31,775 --> 00:41:33,834
as big as a house.

509
00:41:33,911 --> 00:41:37,711
I never seen the moon
so big before or since.

510
00:41:37,781 --> 00:41:41,217
I was almost scared,
like it was gonna crush the house.

511
00:41:41,285 --> 00:41:43,048
Then I looked down...

512
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,588
and standing there in the street
was Cosmo...

513
00:41:45,656 --> 00:41:48,216
Iooking up at the windows.

514
00:41:48,292 --> 00:41:50,692
This is the funny part.

515
00:41:50,761 --> 00:41:52,752
I got mad at you, Cosmo.

516
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:56,322
I thought you had brought
that big moon over to my house...

517
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,925
'cause you were so in love...

518
00:41:59,002 --> 00:42:00,902
and woke me up with it.

519
00:42:00,971 --> 00:42:03,269
I was half asleep I guess.
I didn't know any better.

520
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:06,673
You were altogether asleep.
You were dreaming.

521
00:42:10,214 --> 00:42:11,647
You were there.

522
00:42:12,716 --> 00:42:14,183
I don't want to talk about it.

523
00:42:14,251 --> 00:42:16,515
What do you want to talk about?

524
00:42:16,587 --> 00:42:19,021
Why are you drinking so much?

525
00:42:20,758 --> 00:42:24,285
Old man, you give those dogs
another piece of my food...

526
00:42:24,361 --> 00:42:27,296
I'll kick you
till you're dead.

527
00:43:12,576 --> 00:43:14,669
You drank too much.

528
00:43:14,745 --> 00:43:19,182
You'll sleep too hard, and later
you'll be up when you should be down.

529
00:44:10,734 --> 00:44:14,670
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. I'm looking at the moon.

530
00:44:23,747 --> 00:44:25,180
It's perfect.

531
00:44:25,249 --> 00:44:27,649
I never seen a moon
like that before.

532
00:44:30,087 --> 00:44:32,521
Makes you look like an angel.

533
00:44:36,293 --> 00:44:40,855
Looks like a giant snowball.

534
00:44:43,066 --> 00:44:45,193
- Rita.
- What?

535
00:44:45,269 --> 00:44:48,534
Rita, dear, wake up.

536
00:44:51,608 --> 00:44:53,041
Look.

537
00:44:56,713 --> 00:44:59,978
It's Cosmo's moon.

538
00:45:00,050 --> 00:45:04,646
What are you talking about?
Cosmo can't own the moon.

539
00:45:04,721 --> 00:45:09,317
It's that moon
I was talking about at dinner.

540
00:45:19,736 --> 00:45:21,226
Is he down there?

541
00:45:21,305 --> 00:45:23,136
Is who down there?

542
00:45:25,776 --> 00:45:29,678
- What would he be doing down there?
- I don't know.

543
00:45:35,419 --> 00:45:38,354
You know something?

544
00:45:38,422 --> 00:45:41,016
In that light...

545
00:45:41,091 --> 00:45:43,355
with that expression
on your face...

546
00:45:45,095 --> 00:45:47,154
you look about 25 years old.

547
00:46:05,549 --> 00:46:08,484
What do you want?

548
00:46:12,723 --> 00:46:14,657
Get out.

549
00:47:02,738 --> 00:47:05,502
Why do you make me wait?

550
00:47:05,574 --> 00:47:07,405
Come on!

551
00:47:07,476 --> 00:47:08,909
Howl!

552
00:47:52,688 --> 00:47:55,384
- Oh, my God!
- What?

553
00:47:55,457 --> 00:47:57,391
- What?
- Take it easy.

554
00:47:57,459 --> 00:48:00,724
- I was trying to do everything right.
- Don't just become excited.

555
00:48:00,796 --> 00:48:04,562
I thought if I stayed away from City
Hall, I wouldn't have bad luck again.

556
00:48:04,633 --> 00:48:07,363
- You're making me feel guilty.
- I'm marrying your brother.

557
00:48:07,436 --> 00:48:09,370
All right, I'm guilty.
I confess.

558
00:48:09,438 --> 00:48:11,838
The wedding's in a couple of weeks.
You're invited.

559
00:48:11,907 --> 00:48:15,070
How come you didn't be like him
and be with your mother in Palermo.

560
00:48:15,144 --> 00:48:19,672
- She don't like me.
- You don't get along with anybody.

561
00:48:19,748 --> 00:48:21,875
- What did you do?
- What did I do?

562
00:48:23,819 --> 00:48:26,413
- You ruined my life.
- That's impossible!

563
00:48:26,488 --> 00:48:29,457
It was ruined when I got here.
You ruined my life.

564
00:48:30,826 --> 00:48:32,919
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did!

565
00:48:34,663 --> 00:48:36,927
You got them bad eyes
like a gypsy.

566
00:48:36,999 --> 00:48:39,263
I don't know why
I didn't see it yesterday.

567
00:48:39,335 --> 00:48:41,929
Bad luck. That's it.
Is that all I'm ever gonna have?

568
00:48:42,004 --> 00:48:45,940
I should have taken a rock
and killed myself years ago.

569
00:48:46,008 --> 00:48:49,774
I'm gonna marry him. Do you hear me?
Last night never happened.

570
00:48:49,845 --> 00:48:53,474
You and I are gonna take this
to our coffins.

571
00:48:53,549 --> 00:48:55,881
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

572
00:48:55,951 --> 00:48:58,181
I'm in love with you.

573
00:49:01,123 --> 00:49:02,556
Snap out of it!

574
00:49:02,625 --> 00:49:05,389
- I can't.
- Then I must never see you again...

575
00:49:05,461 --> 00:49:10,057
and the bad blood will have to stay
between you and Johnny forever.

576
00:49:10,132 --> 00:49:12,396
- And you won't come to the wedding.
- I'll come to the wedding.

577
00:49:12,468 --> 00:49:15,403
- I'm telling you, you can't come!
- He wants me to come.

578
00:49:15,471 --> 00:49:17,564
That's because he don't know.

579
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:20,074
Now wait a minute.
Honey, listen.

580
00:49:20,142 --> 00:49:23,578
All right. I won't come
to the wedding, provided one thing.

581
00:49:23,646 --> 00:49:26,911
- What?
- You come with me tonight to the opera.

582
00:49:26,982 --> 00:49:29,576
- What are you talking about?
- I love two things.

583
00:49:29,652 --> 00:49:32,086
I love you, and I love the opera.

584
00:49:32,154 --> 00:49:35,851
If I can have the two things that I love
together for one night...

585
00:49:35,924 --> 00:49:38,256
I would be satisfied
to give up--

586
00:49:38,327 --> 00:49:41,091
Christ.
To give up the rest of my life.

587
00:49:41,163 --> 00:49:42,596
All right.

588
00:49:44,333 --> 00:49:46,267
- Meet me at the Met.
- All right.

589
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:54,173
- Where's the Met?
- You gotta--

590
00:50:19,535 --> 00:50:21,127
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

591
00:50:21,203 --> 00:50:23,637
It's been two months
since my last confession.

592
00:50:23,706 --> 00:50:26,300
What sins have you to confess?

593
00:50:26,375 --> 00:50:28,468
Twice I took the name
of the Lord in vain...

594
00:50:28,544 --> 00:50:30,307
once I slept with the brother
of my fiance...

595
00:50:30,379 --> 00:50:32,643
and once I bounced a check
at the liquor store...

596
00:50:32,715 --> 00:50:36,116
- but that was really an accident.
- Then it's not a sin.

597
00:50:36,185 --> 00:50:41,088
But what was
that second thing you said?

598
00:50:42,558 --> 00:50:45,322
The one about once I slept
with the brother of my fiance?

599
00:50:45,394 --> 00:50:49,490
- That's a pretty big sin.
- I know.

600
00:50:49,565 --> 00:50:51,396
- You should think about this.
- I know.

601
00:50:52,396 --> 00:51:02,396
