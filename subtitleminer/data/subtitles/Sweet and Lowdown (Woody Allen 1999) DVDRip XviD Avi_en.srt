Why Emmet Ray?
Because he was interesting.

2
00:02:09,917 --> 00:02:12,579
To me, Emmet Ray was
a fascinating character.

3
00:02:12,652 --> 00:02:15,213
I was a huge fan of his
when I was younger.

4
00:02:15,289 --> 00:02:18,258
I thought he was
an absolutely great guitar player...

5
00:02:18,327 --> 00:02:20,262
and he was funny.

6
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:22,264
You know, or...

7
00:02:22,332 --> 00:02:25,392
if funny's the wrong word,
then sort of pathetic in a way.

8
00:02:25,468 --> 00:02:29,131
He was flamboyant
and he was, you know...

9
00:02:29,204 --> 00:02:31,436
boorish and obnoxious.

10
00:02:31,509 --> 00:02:35,000
Well, the problem is that there's
just so little known about him.

11
00:02:35,078 --> 00:02:38,243
But we do know that
he was a great guitar player.

12
00:02:38,316 --> 00:02:42,686
I'd say he was probably the second
greatest guitar player in the world.

13
00:02:42,755 --> 00:02:44,689
Django Reinhardt was the best...

14
00:02:44,756 --> 00:02:47,455
and believe me,
Emmet idolized Django.

15
00:02:47,529 --> 00:02:49,258
He was in awe of him.

16
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:53,789
There's a story that says when he
saw him playing in France, he fainted.

17
00:02:53,868 --> 00:02:59,330
He saw Django again at a restaurant
in Germany, and he fainted again.

18
00:02:59,407 --> 00:03:01,069
It seems that every time...

19
00:03:01,143 --> 00:03:04,271
Django would always make him faint
or he'd make him cry.

20
00:03:05,015 --> 00:03:08,574
Well, his relationship with Hattie
is mostly what's known about him.

21
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:11,621
There are a few Emmet Ray
stories before that...

22
00:03:11,688 --> 00:03:14,589
but I have no idea whether
they're true or not.

23
00:03:14,658 --> 00:03:17,458
First time anybody seemed
to have heard of him was in Chicago.

24
00:03:17,529 --> 00:03:19,792
It was at this roadside joint.

25
00:03:23,936 --> 00:03:26,132
Good to see you tonight.

26
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:31,303
- Where the hell is he?
- I don't know.

27
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,938
You gotta get him, Dan.
He's layin' drunk somewhere.

28
00:03:34,015 --> 00:03:37,178
- He's probably in a poolroom.
- Every night it's somethin' else.

29
00:03:37,252 --> 00:03:40,277
He's late. He gets drunk.
He falls off the bandstand.

30
00:03:40,354 --> 00:03:43,449
- I told you not to hire this guy.
- What time does Emmet Ray go on?

31
00:03:43,526 --> 00:03:46,086
Look at the crowd.
Think they're here to see me?

32
00:03:46,161 --> 00:03:47,858
Relax. I'll find him.

33
00:03:47,931 --> 00:03:50,297
I'm gonna have to
hold the show again.

34
00:03:50,366 --> 00:03:52,960
I'll kill this guy.
I don't care what kind of artist he is.

35
00:03:53,035 --> 00:03:56,268
You take care of business.
I'll find him. Just relax.

36
00:03:57,342 --> 00:03:59,539
Hey, good to see you again.

37
00:04:02,714 --> 00:04:04,308
That's 50 more you owe me.

38
00:04:04,384 --> 00:04:08,047
I'm not goin' out of town.
Another one?

39
00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:13,052
I think you got some visitors.

40
00:04:15,029 --> 00:04:16,792
I'll be back.

41
00:04:20,669 --> 00:04:23,104
- What'd we get?
- Here's your end.

42
00:04:28,678 --> 00:04:32,207
This is what you bring me, $30?
It's almost midnight. $30?

43
00:04:32,284 --> 00:04:34,218
That's half, Emmet.
That's all we made.

44
00:04:34,285 --> 00:04:37,416
I can't live on that.
I got car payments, I got new shirts.

45
00:04:37,491 --> 00:04:40,549
I'm sorry. Business was slow.
It's a Jewish holiday.

46
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:44,653
And last night it was rainin', and
the night before you got food poisonin'.

47
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:47,790
- Because I drank that booze you made.
- Listen, Emmet.

48
00:04:47,867 --> 00:04:51,201
I don't know how to tell you this,
but while I was in bed...

49
00:04:51,272 --> 00:04:56,641
with one of the johns you sent me,
he got very excited, and he...

50
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:59,944
got a heart attack,
and he dropped dead.

51
00:05:01,417 --> 00:05:04,444
- Which one?
- The salesman from Detroit.

52
00:05:04,521 --> 00:05:08,183
- What did you do?
- I took my clothes and I left.

53
00:05:08,257 --> 00:05:10,784
So there's nothin'
to trace back to us?

54
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:15,058
Then I was thinking that maybe
he had one of your business cards.

55
00:05:16,134 --> 00:05:19,298
- Oh, my God.
- A pimp doesn't need business cards!

56
00:05:19,372 --> 00:05:21,306
You're always tryin'
to be too fancy.

57
00:05:21,374 --> 00:05:24,342
Emmet, let's go.
You're supposed to be on stage.

58
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:27,641
Every night you're either late,
drunk, or you don't show up.

59
00:05:27,714 --> 00:05:29,944
What is it with you?

60
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:44,864
How are you doin'?
I'm on right now.

61
00:05:44,935 --> 00:05:47,527
Thanks for comin'.
Put their tab on my bill.

62
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:52,172
I don't wanna embarrass you in front of
friends, but boss said no more advances.

63
00:05:52,243 --> 00:05:55,441
Don't give me a song and dance.
Just put their tab on my bill.

64
00:05:55,514 --> 00:05:57,243
Hi, guys.

65
00:08:22,786 --> 00:08:26,415
It's gonna be a lot of cats there.
We always have fun at Don's.

66
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:28,583
- Donald.
- Well, Donald.

67
00:08:28,658 --> 00:08:30,592
- Watch out over there.
- I got this, man.

68
00:08:30,661 --> 00:08:33,097
You take care of that.
And don't forget to pass.

69
00:08:33,165 --> 00:08:36,292
- They caught him a couple of times.
- Caught what?

70
00:08:36,367 --> 00:08:39,167
Mind your business.
Watch the road.

71
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,570
What you got there, man?
Is that a.45?

72
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,042
.45 what?
Wait, wait.

73
00:08:45,345 --> 00:08:47,370
Better put that shit away.

74
00:08:47,447 --> 00:08:50,977
Hey, you wanna go to the dump,
shoot some rats? Huh?

75
00:08:51,053 --> 00:08:53,316
- Shoot some what?
- Rats.

76
00:08:53,388 --> 00:08:56,255
I do it all the time.
It's a lot of fun.

77
00:08:56,325 --> 00:09:00,228
- A hepcat shootin' rats.
- I don't think you need no more of this.

78
00:09:00,296 --> 00:09:04,994
There should be no other guns
in this car besides my gun.

79
00:09:22,255 --> 00:09:24,689
Man, where'd you learn
to play that thing like that?

80
00:09:24,758 --> 00:09:28,662
- I never heard guitar sound so good.
- Yeah, I'm the greatest in the world.

81
00:09:28,731 --> 00:09:31,220
Well, you know,
in France there's Django.

82
00:09:31,299 --> 00:09:35,326
Django? You know, he's comin'
to America in the summer to record.

83
00:09:35,404 --> 00:09:38,636
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Ever meet him?

84
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:41,232
I could've once, in Europe.

85
00:09:41,311 --> 00:09:44,074
You know, really,
our styles are just different.

86
00:09:44,148 --> 00:09:47,741
Nate Drummond prefers me.
He says I'm miraculous.

87
00:09:47,816 --> 00:09:51,777
You're welcome to come here anytime.
You know, we play here all the time.

88
00:09:51,856 --> 00:09:54,654
- And I make great chili.
- Well, thank you.

89
00:10:12,814 --> 00:10:15,646
Say, man, we're about to hit it.
Can we drop you somewhere?

90
00:10:15,716 --> 00:10:18,084
- I like the air. I'll walk.
- You sure about that?

91
00:10:18,154 --> 00:10:20,087
Yeah. Thank you.

92
00:10:48,755 --> 00:10:51,658
Well, I heard stories
that he was a kleptomaniac.

93
00:10:51,727 --> 00:10:55,664
I heard that once he stole
an alarm clock from Hoagy Carmichael...

94
00:10:55,731 --> 00:10:58,529
and Hoagy overslept
and he missed a record date.

95
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,192
What do you think?

96
00:11:00,269 --> 00:11:04,764
The only other story that I heard,
other than Hattie, was this moon idea.

97
00:11:04,841 --> 00:11:08,334
He had this idea
about this crescent moon.

98
00:11:08,412 --> 00:11:11,471
That he wanted to make an entrance
on this big crescent moon.

99
00:11:11,547 --> 00:11:14,917
Well, the story is that
it came to him, apparently...

100
00:11:14,986 --> 00:11:17,181
I guess, in a dream...

101
00:11:17,255 --> 00:11:19,749
that he'd build this moon thing
with his own money.

102
00:11:19,826 --> 00:11:22,521
Because he thought that
a star of his great stature...

103
00:11:22,595 --> 00:11:26,430
ought to be able to make
a real big entrance with a moon.

104
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,613
Just try to visualize it.

105
00:11:27,614 --> 00:11:28,729
Just try to visualize it.

106
00:11:28,803 --> 00:11:32,000
You're lookin' up, and there it is.
Gold, beautiful moon.

107
00:11:32,073 --> 00:11:35,339
I'm comin' down, and you guys
are playin'. What do you think?

108
00:11:35,411 --> 00:11:38,573
It's a stupid idea. I told you.
Would you let me take this shot?

109
00:11:38,646 --> 00:11:42,176
I didn't ask your opinion.
I'm just tellin' you how it's gonna go.

110
00:11:52,329 --> 00:11:55,458
And then the jacket
would match the moon...

111
00:11:55,534 --> 00:11:58,663
against a black
velvet background.

112
00:11:58,738 --> 00:12:01,969
- What do you think?
- It sounds okay to me.

113
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:04,202
- Yeah.
- It's fancy.

114
00:12:05,678 --> 00:12:08,410
I'm considered
the best guitar player...

115
00:12:08,483 --> 00:12:10,451
maybe that ever lived.

116
00:12:12,019 --> 00:12:14,455
Certainly in this country.
There's this...

117
00:12:14,523 --> 00:12:17,012
There's a gypsy in France...

118
00:12:17,091 --> 00:12:20,550
and he's the most
beautiful thing I ever heard.

119
00:12:22,598 --> 00:12:24,192
Tonight's the night.

120
00:12:24,268 --> 00:12:27,998
Emmet, just as long as you're happy.
That's the most important thing.

121
00:12:28,071 --> 00:12:29,664
It's really beautiful.

122
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:32,538
It is really beautiful.
It's like jewelry.

123
00:12:34,314 --> 00:12:38,146
Hey, I wanna just be alone with
the moon for a minute, all right?

124
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:41,186
You wanna be alone
with the moon? Okay.

125
00:12:41,254 --> 00:12:44,188
Emmet, you know what you are?
You're a genius.

126
00:12:59,808 --> 00:13:02,211
She's a knockout, ain't she?

127
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,008
Hope it's safe.

128
00:13:05,015 --> 00:13:08,145
Of course it's safe.
Why wouldn't it be safe?

129
00:13:08,219 --> 00:13:12,485
It's a hell of a drop.
A man can break his neck.

130
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:15,189
Really?

131
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:19,289
And it starts to build and build
in Emmet's mind.

132
00:13:19,366 --> 00:13:21,798
And by show time...

133
00:13:21,866 --> 00:13:25,133
he's numb with fear,
he's petrified.

134
00:13:25,205 --> 00:13:28,140
And the audience is out there
waiting for him...

135
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:31,475
and he's backstage, meanwhile,
drinking and drinking.

136
00:13:31,546 --> 00:13:35,177
When he's ready to go on,
he's stiff as a board.

137
00:13:38,153 --> 00:13:40,589
- Snazzy!
- Did you buy that off the rack?

138
00:13:42,326 --> 00:13:44,259
Look. The Big Dipper.

139
00:13:44,327 --> 00:13:48,286
- Emmet, your gun is bulging.
- Do you think?

140
00:13:48,364 --> 00:13:50,389
What the hell you
need it on stage for?

141
00:13:50,466 --> 00:13:52,459
I don't feel right
without it.

142
00:13:52,537 --> 00:13:54,971
I'll give it back to you
as soon as you're done.

143
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:57,100
Show time!

144
00:14:14,264 --> 00:14:16,788
- You all right?
- Emmet, be careful.

145
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:24,903
You're on?

146
00:14:25,978 --> 00:14:28,001
Need a hand?

147
00:14:28,077 --> 00:14:29,809
Let's do it.

148
00:15:29,886 --> 00:15:34,255
Sooner or later,
everybody's dreams go up in smoke.

149
00:15:34,988 --> 00:15:37,219
What about my dreams?

150
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:39,556
I can't settle down, Ann.

151
00:15:39,628 --> 00:15:42,189
- We don't have to marry.
- I can't.

152
00:15:42,265 --> 00:15:45,394
I gotta be free.
I'm an artist.

153
00:15:45,469 --> 00:15:47,734
I thought you liked me.

154
00:15:49,106 --> 00:15:51,040
We have fun.

155
00:15:51,108 --> 00:15:55,102
I took you to the dump.
I let you shoot my gun at some rats.

156
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:58,584
Shootin' rats at the dump
is not my idea of a good time.

157
00:15:58,652 --> 00:16:00,984
Why not?
We brought sandwiches.

158
00:16:01,054 --> 00:16:04,752
And sittin' at the railroads watchin'
trains, that's pretty strange too.

159
00:16:04,826 --> 00:16:08,558
See? That's what I mean.

160
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:12,588
What I like to do, what you like to do,
ain't the same thing.

161
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:14,465
That's not it, Emmet.

162
00:16:14,536 --> 00:16:16,628
It's that you keep
your feelings locked up...

163
00:16:16,705 --> 00:16:19,540
and you can't feel nothin'
for anybody else.

164
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:21,771
You say that
like it's a bad thing.

165
00:16:21,846 --> 00:16:26,546
Some terrible things happen
to people in love. I know. I've seen it.

166
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:29,917
I enjoy the company of women.
I love 'em.

167
00:16:29,988 --> 00:16:33,355
It's just that
I don't need 'em.

168
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:37,363
I guess, you know, that's the way it is
when you're a true artist.

169
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,500
It doesn't mean
we can't fool around.

170
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:46,267
Oh, right.
Or shoot rats or watch trains.

171
00:16:46,341 --> 00:16:50,539
I never met anybody that
keeps their feelings so locked up.

172
00:16:50,612 --> 00:16:53,411
I let my feelin's
come out in my music.

173
00:16:53,482 --> 00:16:57,886
Maybe if you let your feelings out in
real life, your music would be better.

174
00:16:57,954 --> 00:16:59,614
Don't talk.

175
00:17:03,528 --> 00:17:06,156
Emmet met Hattie in New Jersey.

176
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:09,257
The band was playing a resort hotel.

177
00:17:09,334 --> 00:17:12,064
On a day off, Emmet...

178
00:17:12,137 --> 00:17:15,869
and his drummer,
Bill Shields...

179
00:17:15,942 --> 00:17:18,433
were doing their
version of charm.

180
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:21,572
They were trying to pick up girls
on the boardwalk.

181
00:17:24,986 --> 00:17:27,715
This place is heaven on earth.
Cotton candy, eight o'clock.

182
00:17:27,788 --> 00:17:29,380
Watch me work.

183
00:17:30,325 --> 00:17:32,817
Mary! Right?

184
00:17:32,895 --> 00:17:35,328
Why don't you drop dead, jerk?

185
00:17:35,397 --> 00:17:39,266
I thought you were someone I knew.
Sometimes I hit with a... Mary!

186
00:17:39,335 --> 00:17:41,064
Martina. Mary Ann.

187
00:17:41,137 --> 00:17:43,039
Marge. Kate?

188
00:17:43,107 --> 00:17:46,337
Excuse me, miss.
I'm a photography buff myself.

189
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:49,505
I was thinkin' maybe we could
get my friend to take a picture of us.

190
00:17:49,581 --> 00:17:51,516
Wait a minute. Time out.

191
00:17:51,584 --> 00:17:53,849
- Do you see this?
- Oh, yeah.

192
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,786
Did you see? She looked
right at me. She smiled.

193
00:17:56,856 --> 00:17:59,951
- That was a smile.
- And she was lookin' right at me.

194
00:18:00,026 --> 00:18:01,492
Which one you want?

195
00:18:01,561 --> 00:18:03,392
The little one
with the silly hat.

196
00:18:03,463 --> 00:18:05,397
She's more my size.
I'll flip you.

197
00:18:05,466 --> 00:18:07,660
- I saw her first!
- All right!

198
00:18:07,734 --> 00:18:10,204
You want the little one?
Take the little one.

199
00:18:10,272 --> 00:18:12,297
I'll take the redhead.
What difference does it make?

200
00:18:12,373 --> 00:18:15,811
They're gettin' away. There's
nothin' wrong with the little one.

201
00:18:15,879 --> 00:18:18,746
The redhead's got
nice legs and a nice chest.

202
00:18:18,815 --> 00:18:20,943
- I'll take the redhead.
- The little one is cute.

203
00:18:21,018 --> 00:18:24,976
She has a nice face and those Cupid-bow
lips I like, but I'll take the redhead.

204
00:18:25,054 --> 00:18:26,718
- You wanted the little one.
- I changed my mind.

205
00:18:26,792 --> 00:18:28,383
I'll flip you.

206
00:18:30,596 --> 00:18:32,257
- Call.
- Tails.

207
00:18:35,634 --> 00:18:37,866
- I got the little one.
- We agree.

208
00:18:37,938 --> 00:18:40,337
- Now they gotta agree.
- Come on.

209
00:18:41,842 --> 00:18:44,902
I'm telling you, you're gonna
get on the Ferris wheel this time.

210
00:18:44,978 --> 00:18:48,780
Remember when you tried to go on?
Last year we tried to get you up there.

211
00:18:48,851 --> 00:18:50,785
- Excuse me.
- You were scared.

212
00:18:50,853 --> 00:18:54,153
Hi. You ladies from around here?

213
00:18:54,224 --> 00:18:56,384
Yeah, we work right near here.

214
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:59,155
I'm Billy Shields.
I'm a musician.

215
00:18:59,229 --> 00:19:02,221
He's with my quintet.
I'm Emmet Ray.

216
00:19:02,299 --> 00:19:04,735
The Emmet Ray Hot Quintet.
We're at the Lakeside Ballroom.

217
00:19:04,803 --> 00:19:08,828
It's our day off, so we were thinking
maybe you could show us the sights.

218
00:19:08,905 --> 00:19:11,842
- You wanna go watch some trains?
- What?

219
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:14,938
He's kidding.
Let's go for a drink.

220
00:19:16,449 --> 00:19:19,214
Ask him. I liked you instantly.
I'm bein' honest.

221
00:19:19,286 --> 00:19:21,448
We flipped, he won, I got you.

222
00:19:21,523 --> 00:19:23,854
I'm Gracie MacRae.

223
00:19:23,924 --> 00:19:25,355
Billy Shields.

224
00:19:25,427 --> 00:19:29,523
And if I may say, you have the most
beautiful blue eyes I've ever seen.

225
00:19:29,597 --> 00:19:31,965
This is my friend Hattie.

226
00:19:32,035 --> 00:19:34,229
Hattie, I'm Emmet Ray.

227
00:19:34,303 --> 00:19:37,671
I've got the quintet.
You like jazz music, baby?

228
00:19:37,741 --> 00:19:40,539
How about we take
a boat ride, huh?

229
00:19:40,611 --> 00:19:43,274
Well, sure.
We'd love to.

230
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:45,873
- We'll ride around the lake.
- Great.

231
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:48,885
What's your name?
Don't be shy, darlin'.

232
00:19:48,953 --> 00:19:52,047
Hattie don't talk.
She's mute.

233
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:56,128
Wanna go take a boat ride?

234
00:20:17,087 --> 00:20:19,521
Don't overthrow it.
Throw it down.

235
00:20:25,496 --> 00:20:27,931
That was a good try.
Try it one more time.

236
00:20:29,267 --> 00:20:31,394
That was all right.
Good try.

237
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:33,403
Thanks for stickin' me
with the dummy.

238
00:20:33,472 --> 00:20:37,409
- Stop whining. You wanted her.
- Then I changed my mind.

239
00:20:37,478 --> 00:20:39,172
She seems like a nice girl.

240
00:20:39,246 --> 00:20:41,714
How could she seem like anything?
She doesn't talk.

241
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:44,684
This is my one day off.
I want a talkin' girl.

242
00:20:44,753 --> 00:20:48,383
- I think she's a bit of a half-wit.
- What do you mean?

243
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:50,722
Gracie says
she's not all there in the head.

244
00:20:50,794 --> 00:20:52,522
Well, that's great.

245
00:20:52,594 --> 00:20:55,428
A man like me, got ideas.

246
00:20:55,498 --> 00:20:57,659
Try to have
a good time today, huh?

247
00:20:57,733 --> 00:21:00,363
You girls wanna
go for a walk on the pier?

248
00:21:04,008 --> 00:21:06,000
You hungry?

249
00:21:07,712 --> 00:21:10,045
Is that a yes or a no?

250
00:21:10,116 --> 00:21:12,049
Yeah, me too.

251
00:21:15,322 --> 00:21:17,255
What? Huh?

252
00:21:24,399 --> 00:21:28,097
I can't read that. It's like a Chinaman.
What do you want?

253
00:21:29,806 --> 00:21:33,243
Do you know how to write?
Did you go to school?

254
00:21:35,577 --> 00:21:39,345
What is that?
Is that a yes or a no?

255
00:21:41,618 --> 00:21:44,782
You're a hard-luck case.
You an orphan?

256
00:21:45,957 --> 00:21:47,584
You don't know?

257
00:21:47,658 --> 00:21:49,889
Oh, this is great.
This is great.

258
00:21:49,962 --> 00:21:52,896
I get a goddamn mute
orphan half-wit.

259
00:21:52,965 --> 00:21:56,231
I get all the winners. Were you
always like this, born like this?

260
00:21:56,302 --> 00:21:58,634
Or did somebody drop you
on your head, or what?

261
00:21:58,705 --> 00:22:02,334
Gracie's hungry.
Let's go get some clams or somethin'.

262
00:22:02,408 --> 00:22:04,137
Can we switch for a while?

263
00:22:04,211 --> 00:22:06,874
No. What's the matter with you?

264
00:22:09,417 --> 00:22:12,319
I was amazing the second
I picked up the instrument.

265
00:22:12,388 --> 00:22:16,348
It's just in me someplace,
like a gift of God.

266
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:20,788
They said I'd have been great,
whatever instrument I chose.

267
00:22:20,863 --> 00:22:23,731
But on guitar,
nobody can touch me.

268
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:27,266
Except this gypsy in France.

269
00:22:27,339 --> 00:22:31,172
But mostly, I'm untouchable.
They want me to record.

270
00:22:31,242 --> 00:22:34,213
They do, but I don't know.

271
00:22:34,281 --> 00:22:37,411
Once you record,
everybody can copy your stuff.

272
00:22:37,485 --> 00:22:39,420
They steal your ideas.

273
00:22:39,487 --> 00:22:43,652
Why do I wanna make something beautiful
just to have some jerk copy it?

274
00:22:47,093 --> 00:22:50,463
You wanna come hear
the show sometime? My guest?

275
00:22:50,532 --> 00:22:52,467
- Both of you.
- Yeah.

276
00:22:53,536 --> 00:22:55,662
You'd appreciate it. You would.

277
00:22:55,737 --> 00:22:59,766
You'll see.
I possess a great talent.

278
00:22:59,843 --> 00:23:03,438
You might be mute,
but you're not deaf, right?

279
00:23:03,514 --> 00:23:06,178
And you don't have to be bright.
Music's for everybody.

280
00:23:06,252 --> 00:23:08,344
The smart or the dumb.

281
00:23:12,158 --> 00:23:15,491
- How'd you lose your voice?
- She don't know.

282
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:18,360
It was somethin' when she
was a kid, like a high fever.

283
00:23:18,433 --> 00:23:20,367
She doesn't remember.

284
00:23:21,703 --> 00:23:25,139
- Is she...
- Yeah, but she's a good laundress.

285
00:23:30,612 --> 00:23:33,516
I've shot guys.
That's right.

286
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:37,177
Well, I had to.
You know, it was them or me.

287
00:23:37,253 --> 00:23:39,723
I could tell you stories.

288
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:42,656
What do you say we go
to the dump, shoot some rats?

289
00:23:42,727 --> 00:23:44,320
What?

290
00:23:44,396 --> 00:23:46,557
Yeah, it'll be a ball.

291
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:48,761
Emmet, please.
Not now, huh?

292
00:23:48,835 --> 00:23:52,771
Well, it's my car, and I say we're
stoppin' at the dump for ten minutes.

293
00:23:56,644 --> 00:23:59,042
- Uh, squeeze.
- You call this fun?

294
00:23:59,112 --> 00:24:02,106
Don't jerk. Just squeeze.
Line it up to your sights.

295
00:24:02,182 --> 00:24:04,911
He's gonna get away.
Line it up in the sights.

296
00:24:04,984 --> 00:24:07,181
- Come on! It's cold!
- In a minute.

297
00:24:07,255 --> 00:24:10,749
- Just do what I'm tellin' you to do!
- Leave her alone already!

298
00:24:10,827 --> 00:24:12,761
There's nothin' to it.

299
00:24:17,268 --> 00:24:19,326
Did you see that?
I got him!

300
00:24:19,403 --> 00:24:21,873
- You call this civil?
- What are you doin'?

301
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:25,340
- No more cheese for this little fella.
- No, don't pick it up.

302
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:27,812
These guys are diseased.
You gotta put it down.

303
00:24:27,881 --> 00:24:30,679
Did you know that rats
attack poor kids in their cribs?

304
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:34,208
- I thought you'd enjoy this.
- Are you crazy?

305
00:24:34,287 --> 00:24:36,015
So, what do you think?

306
00:24:36,088 --> 00:24:39,492
- You wanna come up to my room...
- Do you think we could go out...

307
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:42,154
- hear me play my guitar?
- Alone sometime?

308
00:24:43,263 --> 00:24:45,529
Good. Come on.

309
00:24:50,441 --> 00:24:52,102
Come on in.

310
00:24:57,815 --> 00:25:00,306
That's my guitar.

311
00:25:00,385 --> 00:25:02,717
I'll play it for you soon.

312
00:25:02,788 --> 00:25:04,721
Like a drink?

313
00:25:07,761 --> 00:25:09,852
You know...

314
00:25:09,928 --> 00:25:12,864
I know we don't
know each other...

315
00:25:12,932 --> 00:25:15,423
and we just met, but...

316
00:25:16,504 --> 00:25:19,370
I had a wonderful evening.

317
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,240
I don't need a genius
to have a good time.

318
00:25:24,812 --> 00:25:28,079
You know, I'm a fast worker.

319
00:25:35,092 --> 00:25:37,524
You're not puttin' up
much resistance.

320
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:42,165
Lot of girls do...

321
00:25:42,233 --> 00:25:44,169
on a first date.

322
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,505
Hold on. Hold it.
Time out.

323
00:25:50,576 --> 00:25:53,636
Just I'm gettin'
a little razzled with your pace.

324
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:58,184
You like me?

325
00:26:01,623 --> 00:26:03,886
Just expected more of a fight.

326
00:26:05,659 --> 00:26:09,257
This is... It's like
shootin' fish in a barrel.

327
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:25,873
Did you like that?

328
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:27,886
I knew you would.

329
00:26:29,455 --> 00:26:31,719
They say I'm a wonderful lover.

330
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:35,494
You got a terrific body.
You really do.

331
00:26:35,563 --> 00:26:38,622
Round. I like round.
And I don't mean fat.

332
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,861
You got some heft.

333
00:26:40,936 --> 00:26:44,532
Makes a fella feel like
he's been someplace.

334
00:26:45,908 --> 00:26:48,467
Now get dressed.

335
00:26:48,543 --> 00:26:51,571
I'm tired.
I gotta go to sleep.

336
00:26:51,648 --> 00:26:54,082
If I don't get my sleep,
I'm cranky.

337
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:59,946
I'd give you cab fare, but I
don't assume it's a long walk home.

338
00:27:02,727 --> 00:27:05,058
First time I had sex,
seven years old.

339
00:27:05,128 --> 00:27:07,793
The guitar. Right.

340
00:27:07,867 --> 00:27:10,266
Well, that's why
we came up here.

341
00:27:11,336 --> 00:27:13,602
All right, you get dressed.

342
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:16,937
I'm exhausted.
What's your favorite song?

343
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,378
Oh, look who I'm askin'.

344
00:29:55,595 --> 00:29:57,529
I lived in Detroit...

345
00:29:57,597 --> 00:29:59,691
and Canada...

346
00:29:59,767 --> 00:30:01,702
and New York...

347
00:30:03,038 --> 00:30:04,800
St. Louis.

348
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:09,010
My father was in the army.

349
00:30:09,078 --> 00:30:11,172
I never got along with him.

350
00:30:12,314 --> 00:30:14,512
He used to hit me with a belt.

351
00:30:16,586 --> 00:30:18,283
He's dead now.

352
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:22,190
Got asphyxiated.

353
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:30,099
I'm pretty sure
my mother's dead too.

354
00:30:30,171 --> 00:30:32,263
She used to get spells.

355
00:30:33,572 --> 00:30:37,101
I don't know if her family
put her away somewhere...

356
00:30:39,479 --> 00:30:42,178
or if she's dead.

357
00:30:42,251 --> 00:30:44,912
She used to foam at the mouth.

358
00:30:50,059 --> 00:30:52,859
She sang beautifully.

359
00:30:52,929 --> 00:30:55,455
The most beautiful music
I ever heard.

360
00:30:59,971 --> 00:31:01,964
Except for this...

361
00:31:02,041 --> 00:31:04,635
gypsy guitar player in France.

362
00:31:06,678 --> 00:31:09,613
Can you believe I can't
listen to him without cryin'?

363
00:31:58,272 --> 00:32:00,206
Give us a shot, would you?

364
00:32:08,786 --> 00:32:12,187
So I'm gonna be busy later.
Somethin' came up.

365
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,983
You just go get yourself
home by yourself.

366
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:24,196
Now wait.
What was that look for?

367
00:32:24,271 --> 00:32:26,205
What did I do?

368
00:32:29,641 --> 00:32:31,576
I got business.

369
00:32:34,681 --> 00:32:37,276
We gotta spend
every minute together?

370
00:32:42,024 --> 00:32:43,513
Look.

371
00:32:44,592 --> 00:32:47,291
You go get yourself a cab...

372
00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:49,298
and I'll see you tomorrow.

373
00:33:58,682 --> 00:34:00,615
Where the hell am I?

374
00:34:08,323 --> 00:34:10,259
Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania?

375
00:34:11,594 --> 00:34:15,828
I take one puff in New Jersey,
I end up in Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania?

376
00:34:15,901 --> 00:34:17,833
I gotta get a cab.

377
00:34:24,576 --> 00:34:27,706
I need a taxi!
Can I get a cab?

378
00:34:29,415 --> 00:34:32,214
I'm sorry, Emmet.
I had no choice.

379
00:34:32,286 --> 00:34:35,744
- We got a contract.
- Look, I run a first- class hotel here.

380
00:34:35,825 --> 00:34:37,985
- This was an emergency.
- Yeah, an emergency.

381
00:34:38,059 --> 00:34:40,187
What kind of emergency?

382
00:34:40,262 --> 00:34:42,198
- My father died.
- Again?

383
00:34:42,265 --> 00:34:44,231
How many times
can your father pass away?

384
00:34:44,298 --> 00:34:47,532
I'm gonna come clean with you.
I got abducted and I was threatened.

385
00:34:47,605 --> 00:34:50,595
You were gone for four days.
We had the police out.

386
00:34:50,673 --> 00:34:54,167
I'm tired of shootin' crap every night
to see if my main attraction will show.

387
00:34:54,246 --> 00:34:55,770
It's over.

388
00:34:56,847 --> 00:34:59,943
Look, I gotta borrow
a few bucks for cab fare.

389
00:35:00,019 --> 00:35:02,714
You're kidding.
How much?

390
00:35:02,788 --> 00:35:05,224
Nine hundred dollars.

391
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:22,269
What's the matter?
Oh, I know this routine.

392
00:35:22,345 --> 00:35:25,802
Look, I'm a free agent.
I do as I please.

393
00:35:25,882 --> 00:35:29,612
I might as well tell you.
I quit the job.

394
00:35:29,685 --> 00:35:32,450
I told him to take that job
and stick it.

395
00:35:34,992 --> 00:35:38,929
So the band's leavin' for Hollywood
two weeks sooner than I thought.

396
00:35:40,132 --> 00:35:42,396
I didn't tell you
about Hollywood.

397
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:47,665
We're makin' a movie.

398
00:35:47,742 --> 00:35:51,198
Yeah. Just a little short one.

399
00:35:51,277 --> 00:35:54,737
Just a couple of minutes of me and
the boys playin' that tune, "All Of Me."

400
00:35:54,817 --> 00:35:56,749
You know? Good.

401
00:35:58,321 --> 00:36:01,256
What are you lookin' at me
like that for? What?

402
00:36:03,524 --> 00:36:07,156
Look, I got together with
a couple of guys, we had a few drinks.

403
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:10,395
One thing led to another...

404
00:36:10,467 --> 00:36:14,335
and the next thing I knew,
I woke up out of town.

405
00:36:16,575 --> 00:36:20,170
Look, I don't have to
account to you. All right?

406
00:36:20,247 --> 00:36:24,478
We're not married.
I'm not the marryin' kind.

407
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:26,486
I can't settle.

408
00:36:28,122 --> 00:36:30,385
Whole idea leaves me cold.

409
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:34,818
So I thought I'd...

410
00:36:34,895 --> 00:36:37,024
I thought I'd...

411
00:36:37,099 --> 00:36:39,625
buy you some lunch...

412
00:36:39,701 --> 00:36:41,634
and say good-bye.

413
00:36:42,973 --> 00:36:47,238
And I'll be comin' through here again,
I'm sure, sometime.

414
00:36:51,481 --> 00:36:54,146
But you really are
a spoiled dope, you know?

415
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:58,153
I take you out to buy you things
or go to the movies, you're fine.

416
00:36:58,222 --> 00:37:00,955
But the minute somethin'
doesn't go your way...

417
00:37:02,093 --> 00:37:05,087
I gotta go, and there's
no way you can come with me.

418
00:37:05,165 --> 00:37:09,191
I mean, you got responsibilities.
You got a job.

419
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:11,203
You have...

420
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:14,103
underwear and socks to wash.

421
00:37:14,173 --> 00:37:17,611
And I can't have my life cluttered.
I'm an artist.

422
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:19,738
A truly great artist.

423
00:37:19,814 --> 00:37:22,512
I need to be free...

424
00:37:22,586 --> 00:37:25,281
so I'm saying good-bye, okay?

425
00:37:29,794 --> 00:37:32,026
Look. How many fingers I got?

426
00:37:32,098 --> 00:37:33,655
Ten, right?

427
00:37:33,732 --> 00:37:37,260
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six.

428
00:37:39,472 --> 00:37:41,906
There's eleven. You see?

429
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,972
All right, look.
If you come, it's not a free ride.

430
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:52,812
I'm not a charity organization,
all right?

431
00:37:52,885 --> 00:37:55,650
I don't know what I'm doin' here.

432
00:37:55,724 --> 00:37:58,819
Hey, if you come, you work.

433
00:38:24,356 --> 00:38:25,948
What's the matter?

434
00:38:27,161 --> 00:38:29,322
Nobody said it was
gonna be a picnic.

435
00:38:29,397 --> 00:38:31,661
You know I can't
risk my hands.

436
00:39:14,782 --> 00:39:17,445
Well, that might not be a bad idea.

437
00:39:28,567 --> 00:39:30,584
And now, folks,
Chester Weems, a housepainter...

438
00:39:30,585 --> 00:39:32,603
And now, folks,
Chester Weems, a housepainter...

439
00:39:32,672 --> 00:39:34,605
will play the saw.

440
00:39:58,334 --> 00:40:03,205
Fast falls the eventide

441
00:40:03,273 --> 00:40:07,174
The darkness deepens

442
00:40:07,243 --> 00:40:11,181
Lord with me abide

443
00:40:11,249 --> 00:40:13,741
The scarlet tanager.

444
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:21,394
The barn owl.

445
00:40:35,111 --> 00:40:37,204
And you are?

446
00:40:37,279 --> 00:40:40,080
Homer P. Risley.

447
00:40:40,151 --> 00:40:42,311
What is your profession, Homer?

448
00:40:42,386 --> 00:40:45,320
Profession?
I'm a birdseed salesman.

449
00:40:45,388 --> 00:40:48,551
- Oh, a traveling salesman.
- That's right, you got it.

450
00:40:48,625 --> 00:40:51,857
And I see that
your instrument is the guitar.

451
00:40:51,929 --> 00:40:54,957
Yeah, that's right.
I've had a few lessons.

452
00:40:55,034 --> 00:40:58,628
No need to be nervous, Homer.
This is a wonderful audience out here.

453
00:41:01,106 --> 00:41:04,076
Birdseed salesman, Homer Risley.

454
00:42:22,102 --> 00:42:25,936
Boy, those guys were ready
to break out the tar and feathers, huh?

455
00:42:26,006 --> 00:42:28,943
Next time you're gonna hustle somebody,
don't play so great.

456
00:42:30,011 --> 00:42:32,706
I can't remember the tunes
if I play badly.

457
00:42:34,449 --> 00:42:37,247
I wonder if Django
ever hustled any suckers.

458
00:42:39,088 --> 00:42:42,286
Look at her. She's frownin'.
She doesn't like it.

459
00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:45,055
Well, they deserved it.
They were jerks.

460
00:42:46,963 --> 00:42:49,560
She's too good-hearted.

461
00:42:49,636 --> 00:42:54,696
A genuinely sweet person.
I like that, respect it.

462
00:42:54,772 --> 00:42:57,175
Won't get you anywhere in life.

463
00:43:00,681 --> 00:43:02,614
I had a dream last night.

464
00:43:04,084 --> 00:43:07,816
I had a dream
we all went out to Hollywood...

465
00:43:07,889 --> 00:43:11,084
and I became discovered
as a major star.

466
00:43:11,157 --> 00:43:13,889
You? A major star?

467
00:43:13,962 --> 00:43:15,793
You were dreamin'.

468
00:43:15,864 --> 00:43:18,129
Why not? I got a good face.

469
00:43:18,201 --> 00:43:21,500
We're in a short subject.
We're the backup band.

470
00:43:21,571 --> 00:43:25,837
We're in the background, Emmet.
We're lucky to be in focus.

471
00:43:25,908 --> 00:43:28,777
You can always get attention
if you know how to do it.

472
00:43:28,846 --> 00:43:32,111
In this dream,
I was standin' there surrounded...

473
00:43:32,183 --> 00:43:34,119
by gorgeous actresses.

474
00:43:35,555 --> 00:43:37,488
See? That she don't like.

475
00:43:37,555 --> 00:43:39,321
Relax.

476
00:43:39,394 --> 00:43:41,725
I'm with you now.

477
00:43:41,795 --> 00:43:45,526
I'm not one of these guys who turns
his head every time some dame walks by.

478
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:48,261
I've had plenty
of beautiful women.

479
00:43:48,335 --> 00:43:50,965
And I always
put 'em in their place.

480
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:54,167
Yeah. "Love 'em and leave 'em,"
that's my motto.

481
00:43:54,242 --> 00:43:58,646
Love 'em and don't look back.
I never once regretted.

482
00:43:58,714 --> 00:44:03,176
Not one time did I ever regret
dumping a beautiful dame.

483
00:44:03,254 --> 00:44:04,845
You gotta keep your guard up.

484
00:44:04,921 --> 00:44:09,154
If you don't, them pretty ones get
their worms in you, and then it's over.

485
00:44:09,227 --> 00:44:12,288
You're done.
Particularly if you're an artist.

486
00:44:12,366 --> 00:44:15,562
I've seen too many guys
cryin' in their beer.

487
00:44:15,635 --> 00:44:17,399
Me?

488
00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:19,404
I'm gonna be a star.

489
00:44:24,878 --> 00:44:26,572
All of me

490
00:44:26,646 --> 00:44:30,085
Why not take all of me

491
00:44:30,151 --> 00:44:31,846
Can't you see

492
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:35,824
I'm no good without you

493
00:44:35,891 --> 00:44:37,723
Take my lips

494
00:44:37,794 --> 00:44:41,195
I wanna lose them

495
00:44:41,264 --> 00:44:43,289
Take my arms

496
00:44:43,367 --> 00:44:46,767
I'll never use them

497
00:44:46,837 --> 00:44:48,897
Your good-bye

498
00:44:48,973 --> 00:44:52,433
Left me with eyes that cry

499
00:44:52,513 --> 00:44:54,207
How can I

500
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:58,307
Go on, dear
without you

501
00:44:58,382 --> 00:45:00,442
You took the part

502
00:45:00,519 --> 00:45:03,115
That once was my heart

503
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:07,821
So why not take all of me

504
00:45:07,896 --> 00:45:10,364
The reason Emmet
hated Hollywood so much...

505
00:45:10,432 --> 00:45:13,230
was because Hattie
was discovered, not him.

506
00:45:13,301 --> 00:45:14,735
That was the truth of it.

507
00:45:14,804 --> 00:45:19,242
She was out there watching him film.
Every day she would hang out on the set.

508
00:45:19,309 --> 00:45:22,903
And one day, for, you know,
some crazy reason...

509
00:45:22,981 --> 00:45:28,078
a director, who happened to be working
the same lot Emmet was on, noticed her.

510
00:45:28,153 --> 00:45:32,555
And the director thought, "This girl
is a dead ringer for May Talmadge."

511
00:45:32,624 --> 00:45:35,526
He was making a movie with
May Talmadge, who was a big star.

512
00:45:35,595 --> 00:45:40,532
And he thought Hattie is exactly what
he wanted to play May Talmadge's sister.

513
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:43,397
And this is
a 30- second part or something.

514
00:45:43,469 --> 00:45:46,463
When he found out that Hattie couldn't
speak, it didn't make any difference...

515
00:45:46,541 --> 00:45:48,475
because the part
had no dialogue.

516
00:45:48,544 --> 00:45:52,071
He just knew he had to have
Hattie to play that part.

517
00:45:52,147 --> 00:45:55,013
Well, Emmet hated the whole idea.

518
00:46:11,001 --> 00:46:12,938
I can't believe you said yes.

519
00:46:13,005 --> 00:46:16,941
Did you nod that dopey face of yours?
Do they know you can't speak?

520
00:46:18,444 --> 00:46:21,039
I don't get it.
You're gonna embarrass me.

521
00:46:21,114 --> 00:46:24,174
Suddenly you're a movie actress.

522
00:46:24,252 --> 00:46:26,185
Don't make me laugh.

523
00:47:24,155 --> 00:47:26,850
Now, as the story goes...

524
00:47:26,924 --> 00:47:29,951
Hattie was playing this love scene
with William Weston...

525
00:47:30,027 --> 00:47:33,792
this handsome older man
who always kissed his leading ladies...

526
00:47:33,865 --> 00:47:36,129
so they said,
with an open mouth.

527
00:47:36,199 --> 00:47:39,690
And he was kissing her,
and they were doing take after take...

528
00:47:39,768 --> 00:47:42,933
and he was kissing her over and over
with an open mouth.

529
00:47:43,005 --> 00:47:48,170
After 30 takes of getting kissed
by this gorgeous leading man...

530
00:47:48,244 --> 00:47:51,112
Hattie went into a small coma.

531
00:47:55,285 --> 00:47:57,617
And that was the last time...

532
00:47:57,687 --> 00:48:00,211
Emmet ever set foot in Hollywood.

533
00:48:00,290 --> 00:48:04,090
Yeah, I remember Emmet and Hattie
back East at that time.

534
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:07,217
In fact, he had a good manager,
this cat named Sid Bishop.

535
00:48:07,296 --> 00:48:09,924
Sid was really good to him,
and he got him a lot of gigs.

536
00:48:09,999 --> 00:48:12,591
Emmet was doing really well,
and that really wasn't easy.

537
00:48:12,666 --> 00:48:15,694
Back then, a lot of musicians
were hurting from the Depression...

538
00:48:15,771 --> 00:48:18,431
and there wasn't
a lot of work to go around.

539
00:48:18,508 --> 00:48:20,771
But Emmet even agreed
at that time...

540
00:48:20,843 --> 00:48:23,675
to do a couple of sides
for the Victor label.

541
00:48:23,745 --> 00:48:26,442
He did "Melancholy Baby,"
"Exactly Like You"...

542
00:48:26,514 --> 00:48:28,811
and "I'll See You In My Dreams."

543
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:23,966
- What do you mean, I'm broke?
- You give it away.

544
00:49:24,035 --> 00:49:26,469
You drink it up.
You pick up checks.

545
00:49:26,539 --> 00:49:29,735
You lose it in poolrooms, and
you're always buyin' Hattie presents.

546
00:49:29,810 --> 00:49:32,642
She's like a kid. She loves
tearin' the paper off the box.

547
00:49:32,712 --> 00:49:34,303
You gotta go on a budget.

548
00:49:34,379 --> 00:49:36,405
I'll go on a budget
if someone will straighten me out.

549
00:49:36,482 --> 00:49:38,473
A budget's not easy
for a guy like you.

550
00:49:38,551 --> 00:49:41,987
- When I set my mind to somethin'...
- You fight every good idea I have.

551
00:49:42,054 --> 00:49:44,282
I'll go on a budget.
I'll be good.

552
00:49:44,355 --> 00:49:46,882
What do you spend on clothes a year?
Do you have any idea?

553
00:49:46,959 --> 00:49:48,653
Want me to look like a bum?

554
00:49:48,726 --> 00:49:51,856
- What about rent?
- I don't know. It's all hotels.

555
00:49:51,931 --> 00:49:54,592
- Any idea what you spend on food?
- The booze gratis?

556
00:49:54,667 --> 00:49:59,127
Help yourself. Do you have any idea
what you spend on food or entertainment?

557
00:49:59,204 --> 00:50:02,264
Do you have any investments,
anything that'll throw off revenue?

558
00:50:02,338 --> 00:50:05,707
I got some savings,
mostly from Hattie takin' in laundry.

559
00:50:05,777 --> 00:50:08,976
Emmet, we gotta look
for places to cut down.

560
00:50:09,049 --> 00:50:12,208
I burned a hundred dollars once.
A guy dared me. He was a four-flusher.

561
00:50:12,282 --> 00:50:14,341
He burned a fifty,
I burned a hundred.

562
00:50:14,418 --> 00:50:18,046
He burned a twenty, I burned
another hundred. I could cut that out.

563
00:50:18,122 --> 00:50:20,920
You wanna end up
in the poorhouse when you're old?

564
00:50:20,991 --> 00:50:23,323
You ever see a poorhouse?

565
00:50:23,394 --> 00:50:26,522
From now on, your salary
and expenses will come to me.

566
00:50:26,598 --> 00:50:28,962
I'm puttin' you on an allowance.

567
00:50:29,032 --> 00:50:31,051
Okay, that's it.
The party's over.

568
00:50:31,052 --> 00:50:33,069
Okay, that's it.
The party's over.

569
00:50:33,137 --> 00:50:37,539
You're spendin' too much,
so now we've gotta go on a budget.

570
00:50:37,607 --> 00:50:41,442
Now, aside from food,
what are your expenses?

571
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:45,008
What about the doctor bills?
You got a doctor?

572
00:50:45,081 --> 00:50:47,950
I bet you I get you
a veterinarian who's cheaper.

573
00:50:48,019 --> 00:50:50,211
And this is goin' out.

574
00:50:51,386 --> 00:50:53,651
What are we?
The electric company?

575
00:50:54,458 --> 00:50:57,185
We gotta save every penny.

576
00:50:58,362 --> 00:50:59,795
What is that?

577
00:51:05,468 --> 00:51:07,730
You remembered my birthday?

578
00:51:10,474 --> 00:51:12,407
We can't afford presents.

579
00:51:13,541 --> 00:51:16,602
That's gotta go back.
It's gotta go back.

580
00:51:23,251 --> 00:51:25,777
These are the kid gloves
I really wanted.

581
00:51:29,724 --> 00:51:32,421
Exactly the gloves
I wanted, these are.

582
00:51:35,897 --> 00:51:38,420
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna cut you a break.

583
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:41,024
It's my birthday and...

584
00:51:41,101 --> 00:51:43,536
So I'm gonna let you
give 'em to me.

585
00:51:47,743 --> 00:51:49,676
You made this yourself?

586
00:51:56,448 --> 00:51:58,714
Your writin' looks like a chicken.

587
00:51:59,854 --> 00:52:03,255
Let's see.
"It's been almost a year...

588
00:52:03,325 --> 00:52:06,088
since we've been together."

589
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,649
Ayear?

590
00:52:08,727 --> 00:52:11,219
Well, that's scary.

591
00:52:16,638 --> 00:52:18,695
What's this word here?

592
00:52:19,974 --> 00:52:22,406
Is that... Is that "love"?

593
00:52:25,077 --> 00:52:28,535
Oh, no. Don't go gettin'
any big ideas here.

594
00:52:28,615 --> 00:52:30,047
Jesus.

595
00:52:32,486 --> 00:52:34,644
I must've ate somethin' bad.

596
00:52:37,323 --> 00:52:39,757
I'm feelin'...
I'm gonna be sick.

597
00:52:46,497 --> 00:52:48,932
- Got somethin' for me today, Mr. Ray?
- I don't.

598
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,935
- Mr. Ray, it's me, Charlie.
- I'm all tapped out.

599
00:52:52,003 --> 00:52:54,406
- You never let me down.
- Look.

600
00:52:54,474 --> 00:52:57,532
I'd like to help you,
but I'm on a budget.

601
00:52:57,608 --> 00:52:59,634
I haven't had
a bowl of soup all day.

602
00:52:59,712 --> 00:53:02,144
What, you wanna make me feel bad?

603
00:53:03,882 --> 00:53:06,851
- That's all you get.
- All right, thanks.

604
00:53:06,919 --> 00:53:09,079
Thanks, Mr. Ray.

605
00:53:09,155 --> 00:53:12,520
What's the urgency?
I came here as quick as I could.

606
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:16,252
- Would you look at this thing?
- This is why I came quick to meet you?

607
00:53:16,326 --> 00:53:18,657
- He only wants 4,000 for it.
- Yeah, so?

608
00:53:18,727 --> 00:53:20,390
Does it fit the budget?

609
00:53:20,464 --> 00:53:22,932
Are you kidding?
We just sold one of your cars.

610
00:53:22,999 --> 00:53:25,869
I'm tryin' to unload
the other one, not buy one.

611
00:53:25,938 --> 00:53:27,528
- If I cut down?
- Cut down?

612
00:53:27,604 --> 00:53:31,132
- Where are you gonna get four grand?
- I'll borrow the money and pay it off.

613
00:53:31,209 --> 00:53:34,609
No one will lend you that kind of money,
and you'll be saddled with payments.

614
00:53:34,678 --> 00:53:36,874
- I want the car.
- No, Emmet.

615
00:53:36,948 --> 00:53:39,040
Hattie will give up desserts.

616
00:53:39,115 --> 00:53:41,547
- I want the car.
- It's out of the question.

617
00:53:41,616 --> 00:53:44,109
- I gotta have the car.
- You don't have the money.

618
00:53:44,188 --> 00:53:47,783
- I gotta have the car.
- There's no way!

619
00:53:47,858 --> 00:53:50,656
- We can't afford it.
- Stop sayin' "we."

620
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:53,060
If I want the car,
I'm gonna get it.

621
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:56,119
- Maybe someday, if it's in your budget.
- Budget! Budget!

622
00:53:56,198 --> 00:53:59,636
You're suffocating me with the budget.
I can't buy Hattie a birthday present.

623
00:53:59,704 --> 00:54:02,365
You can't buy champagne
if you can only afford beer.

624
00:54:02,439 --> 00:54:04,635
I'm the best guitar player
in the world!

625
00:54:04,709 --> 00:54:07,005
If I want the car,
I should have it.

626
00:54:07,076 --> 00:54:08,188
He said it, but he didn't believe it.

627
00:54:08,189 --> 00:54:09,301
He said it, but he didn't believe it.

628
00:54:09,376 --> 00:54:13,108
I mean, in his soul,
he worshipped Django Reinhardt.

629
00:54:13,181 --> 00:54:15,616
It was more than that.
He was frozen by him.

630
00:54:15,685 --> 00:54:18,016
Django was like a god to him.

631
00:54:18,087 --> 00:54:20,885
I don't know if this is true,
or just another Emmet Ray story...

632
00:54:20,957 --> 00:54:24,617
but Sid Bishop, who was trying
to help him financially at the time...

633
00:54:24,692 --> 00:54:28,355
got him a job in this club,
and one night, just before show time...

634
00:54:28,429 --> 00:54:31,832
one of the guys backstage
decides to play a joke on him...

635
00:54:31,901 --> 00:54:33,959
and tells him this lie.

636
00:54:34,035 --> 00:54:36,230
Hey, Emmet!

637
00:54:36,304 --> 00:54:40,332
Emmet, you're not gonna believe it.
Guess who's sittin' at the front table?

638
00:54:40,408 --> 00:54:42,875
Django Reinhardt.

639
00:54:42,944 --> 00:54:47,209
Are you kiddin' me? We should
get him up on stage with you.

640
00:54:47,281 --> 00:54:49,444
Reinhardt.

641
00:54:49,517 --> 00:54:51,883
He's gonna show him up.

642
00:54:51,953 --> 00:54:54,581
- I'm gonna...
- Come on.

643
00:54:54,656 --> 00:54:57,590
Emmet, we can get him
up on stage with us.

644
00:55:01,329 --> 00:55:04,262
- Django Reinhardt's here.
- Really?

645
00:55:10,773 --> 00:55:13,295
Hey, Django's not in the audience.

646
00:55:13,372 --> 00:55:16,536
The house is half-empty. There's
just some guy that looks like Django.

647
00:55:16,609 --> 00:55:19,170
Let's see if he's got
the nerve to come down.

648
00:55:19,245 --> 00:55:21,738
- Harry, let's go.
- Emmet, we're on!

649
00:55:21,815 --> 00:55:23,908
We should do it anyway.

650
00:55:25,016 --> 00:55:28,316
Emmet, come on down.
I'll wait for you.

651
00:55:28,387 --> 00:55:31,880
I'll take you to the front table myself.
I'll introduce you to Django.

652
00:55:31,959 --> 00:55:33,984
Now, as the story goes...

653
00:55:34,061 --> 00:55:37,963
Emmet, as you know, was pathologically
phobic about Django Reinhardt...

654
00:55:38,032 --> 00:55:40,726
so he tried to escape
through the roof.

655
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:42,791
He just figured,
to hell with the job that night.

656
00:55:42,869 --> 00:55:46,963
But remember, this was a guy
who had fainted twice...

657
00:55:47,038 --> 00:55:50,099
when he came face-to-face
with Django Reinhardt in Europe.

658
00:55:50,176 --> 00:55:54,613
He's looking for a way out, and decides
to jump to the building next door.

659
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:58,809
Well, as fate would have it,
he hits a weak spot in the roof...

660
00:55:58,882 --> 00:56:01,943
and crashes through
into somebody's apartment.

661
00:56:02,019 --> 00:56:05,616
As it happened, the apartment was
being used by some counterfeiters...

662
00:56:05,690 --> 00:56:09,056
who thought it was a raid when
he came through the roof, and ran out.

663
00:57:18,395 --> 00:57:21,157
Well, Eddie Durham,
the great jazz pioneer...

664
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:24,097
met Emmet in Chicago in the 1930's.

665
00:57:24,167 --> 00:57:26,190
Here's what he said
about him in his book.

666
00:57:26,268 --> 00:57:29,260
"I met Emmet in Chicago.
It was the height of the Depression.

667
00:57:29,337 --> 00:57:33,775
Work was scarce. A lot of guys
took on teaching music as a sideline.

668
00:57:33,843 --> 00:57:35,434
Emmet refused.

669
00:57:35,510 --> 00:57:39,275
At that time he was married
to a woman named Blanche."

670
00:58:42,142 --> 00:58:44,303
- What are you doing?
- What?

671
00:58:44,377 --> 00:58:45,006
Nothing.

672
00:58:45,007 --> 00:58:45,637
Nothing.

673
00:58:45,712 --> 00:58:48,111
Excuse me, darling.

674
00:58:48,181 --> 00:58:50,116
You were stealing that box.

675
00:58:50,184 --> 00:58:52,913
- No.
- Oh, yes, you were. I saw you.

676
00:58:52,986 --> 00:58:55,319
Why?

677
00:58:55,389 --> 00:58:56,719
I don't know.

678
00:58:56,790 --> 00:58:58,915
You're a genius, you know?

679
00:58:58,991 --> 00:59:02,119
Eubie Blake thinks I'm the best guitar
player in the whole world, bar none.

680
00:59:02,194 --> 00:59:04,526
- And he knows Django.
- Truly?

681
00:59:04,596 --> 00:59:06,531
I'm Blanche Williams.

682
00:59:07,967 --> 00:59:11,164
- Are you gonna squeal on me?
- "Squeal" on you?

683
00:59:14,137 --> 00:59:17,404
Gosh. Not only are you
vain and egotistical...

684
00:59:17,476 --> 00:59:20,739
but you have genuine crudeness.

685
00:59:21,812 --> 00:59:23,747
I didn't want the goddamn thing.

686
00:59:25,582 --> 00:59:28,075
I won't squeal on you
if you take me for a drive...

687
00:59:28,153 --> 00:59:31,211
in that sublime automobile
of yours.

688
00:59:31,288 --> 00:59:32,756
Drive.

689
00:59:32,823 --> 00:59:34,451
Where?

690
00:59:34,526 --> 00:59:37,493
To the ends of the earth.
Astonish me.

691
00:59:42,966 --> 00:59:44,663
It's fun, isn't it?

692
00:59:44,737 --> 00:59:46,929
Well, it's definitely different.

693
00:59:47,003 --> 00:59:49,668
Make sure you don't pull it.
You squeeze it.

694
00:59:49,741 --> 00:59:51,672
Squeeze the trigger.

695
00:59:52,741 --> 00:59:55,769
- Do you do this often?
- Every chance I get.

696
00:59:55,845 --> 00:59:58,006
Specifically, what's the thrill?

697
00:59:58,081 --> 01:00:01,314
Well, I'm not sure, really.
There's one.

698
01:00:01,385 --> 01:00:04,182
And you got him!

699
01:00:04,254 --> 01:00:08,088
Do you get a bigger kick
doing this or stealing small objects?

700
01:00:08,158 --> 01:00:10,283
You know what?
I could really use a drink.

701
01:00:22,937 --> 01:00:25,963
I stop in here every time
I come through Chicago.

702
01:00:26,041 --> 01:00:27,976
She makes great chili.

703
01:00:28,044 --> 01:00:30,637
You like chili?

704
01:00:30,713 --> 01:00:33,180
What do you think of
when you play?

705
01:00:33,248 --> 01:00:35,309
What goes through your mind?

706
01:00:35,386 --> 01:00:37,317
What are your real feelings?

707
01:00:38,785 --> 01:00:41,346
I don't know.
That I'm underpaid.

708
01:00:41,422 --> 01:00:43,753
I think about that sometimes.

709
01:00:43,824 --> 01:00:45,920
Tell me about the girl
you lived with.

710
01:00:49,030 --> 01:00:51,659
She was nice, but I told her
not to fall in love with me.

711
01:00:51,735 --> 01:00:53,668
It was very one-sided.

712
01:00:55,404 --> 01:00:57,803
She was nice, but I just
cut out one night.

713
01:00:57,871 --> 01:01:00,237
She was asleep, I left 500 cash
by the bed, got my stuff...

714
01:01:00,307 --> 01:01:02,243
and got outta there
at 4:00 in the morning.

715
01:01:02,311 --> 01:01:03,867
I didn't want a scene.

716
01:01:03,945 --> 01:01:06,346
She must have really loved you.

717
01:01:06,415 --> 01:01:10,246
I didn't say it was
an easy decision, but...

718
01:01:10,316 --> 01:01:12,253
I needed more than Hattie.

719
01:01:12,322 --> 01:01:15,015
- Do you miss her?
- Not a bit.

720
01:01:15,088 --> 01:01:16,554
I did the right thing for me.

721
01:01:16,623 --> 01:01:18,784
Maybe I wouldn't have met you.

722
01:01:18,859 --> 01:01:22,224
Come on, Emmet. Join us, man.
Cut loose with the fellas.

723
01:01:22,294 --> 01:01:24,628
- You know you want to.
- Yeah?

724
01:01:24,698 --> 01:01:26,357
Please.

725
01:01:26,432 --> 01:01:29,266
Come. You'll enjoy this.
I'm great. I really am.

726
01:02:06,672 --> 01:02:10,665
After-hours jam session.
Chicago South Side.

727
01:02:10,743 --> 01:02:12,713
He's like a cat...

728
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:17,110
feline with the guitar, which is
his only, certainly deepest love.

729
01:02:17,181 --> 01:02:20,413
No, his only. The sound...

730
01:02:20,486 --> 01:02:22,576
the beat, the ideas.

731
01:02:22,652 --> 01:02:24,885
Where do they come from?

732
01:02:24,957 --> 01:02:27,390
Any woman would be second
to his music.

733
01:02:27,459 --> 01:02:31,260
He wouldn't miss me any more
than the woman he abruptly left.

734
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:34,128
He could only feel pain
for his music.

735
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:37,396
Such is the ego of genius.

736
01:02:37,469 --> 01:02:39,402
Must get used to it.

737
01:02:42,439 --> 01:02:44,634
I used to have a stable of girls
in this town.

738
01:02:44,708 --> 01:02:46,107
- No.
- Yeah.

739
01:02:46,176 --> 01:02:49,145
I made some money, but...

740
01:02:49,213 --> 01:02:52,581
whores are unpredictable.

741
01:02:52,651 --> 01:02:54,583
- They're nuts.
- Really?

742
01:02:54,652 --> 01:02:57,211
Yeah. But money's money.

743
01:02:57,286 --> 01:02:59,481
I mean, you pimped
and you procured?

744
01:03:01,124 --> 01:03:03,253
I can't stand it.
It's just too perfect.

745
01:03:03,328 --> 01:03:05,123
- I don't like that word.
- Which?

746
01:03:05,195 --> 01:03:08,755
"Pimp." No, I was a manager.

747
01:03:08,832 --> 01:03:12,267
- What's too perfect?
- That whole seamy world.

748
01:03:12,333 --> 01:03:17,203
The girls I came out with were whores
too, only we called them debutantes.

749
01:03:17,273 --> 01:03:20,368
I lived in a whorehouse
when I was 18 for six months.

750
01:03:20,443 --> 01:03:22,638
Didn't have a job and no money.

751
01:03:22,712 --> 01:03:25,647
The madam put me up.
She was a friend of my mother's.

752
01:03:26,916 --> 01:03:28,850
I'm sure you learned a lot there.

753
01:03:30,219 --> 01:03:33,188
I don't know.
It's like being a cook.

754
01:03:33,256 --> 01:03:36,383
- A cook?
- You're in the kitchen all day.

755
01:03:36,458 --> 01:03:38,393
You don't want to look at the food.

756
01:03:40,397 --> 01:03:43,625
I'd love to be a whore for a year.
Just a year.

757
01:03:43,699 --> 01:03:45,634
If you ever want a manager...

758
01:03:47,136 --> 01:03:49,534
Look. That's a beauty.

759
01:03:49,602 --> 01:03:52,505
What is this fascination
with trains?

760
01:03:52,574 --> 01:03:54,509
What do you mean?

761
01:03:54,577 --> 01:03:58,877
Do you have the urge to go off,
to ride to unknown destinations?

762
01:03:58,948 --> 01:04:00,414
For what point?

763
01:04:00,481 --> 01:04:04,645
Are you trying to recapture some
intangible feeling from childhood...

764
01:04:04,718 --> 01:04:08,747
when you dreamt of glamorous cities
just out of reach?

765
01:04:08,824 --> 01:04:12,419
I'm not trying to capture anything
from childhood. It stank.

766
01:04:12,493 --> 01:04:15,791
Then I can only think it must be
the power of the locomotive...

767
01:04:15,862 --> 01:04:20,130
the sheer, potent sexual energy
that arouses your masculinity.

768
01:04:20,202 --> 01:04:25,106
The wheels, the hot furnace,
the pistons pumping.

769
01:04:25,174 --> 01:04:27,867
You sound like you wanna
go to bed with the train.

770
01:05:03,843 --> 01:05:05,775
He's impulsive and hot-tempered...

771
01:05:05,844 --> 01:05:10,282
yet he listens to the recordings
of Django Reinhardt for hours and cries.

772
01:05:10,350 --> 01:05:13,684
He has never met this gypsy guitarist
and never wants to.

773
01:05:13,754 --> 01:05:16,380
I think because he doesn't
want to learn Django's mortal.

774
01:05:17,657 --> 01:05:19,591
He sleeps with the light on
in the room...

775
01:05:19,658 --> 01:05:24,288
and last night he woke up screaming
the name of his old girlfriend Hattie.

776
01:05:24,363 --> 01:05:26,524
Then he asked me to marry him.

777
01:05:49,420 --> 01:05:51,352
Get a load of those legs?

778
01:05:52,958 --> 01:05:55,016
Take your hat off.
She grew up with a butler.

779
01:05:59,096 --> 01:06:01,654
It was very impulsive.

780
01:06:01,731 --> 01:06:04,859
And as soon as they were married,
right from the start...

781
01:06:04,936 --> 01:06:07,426
it was very shaky.

782
01:06:07,504 --> 01:06:11,339
Why did he marry her so suddenly?
I don't know.

783
01:06:11,408 --> 01:06:14,639
You know, they only had one thing
in common: Clothes.

784
01:06:14,711 --> 01:06:16,734
They were like two peacocks.

785
01:06:16,813 --> 01:06:20,944
But there was always an unreal
quality to the whole thing.

786
01:06:21,018 --> 01:06:24,009
Talk about doomed relationships.

787
01:06:24,088 --> 01:06:26,113
I feel like gettin' out.

788
01:06:26,189 --> 01:06:29,089
Me too, Emmet, but we're broke.

789
01:06:29,159 --> 01:06:31,650
He's gonna give me my job back!
He said so.

790
01:06:31,729 --> 01:06:34,287
If you show up on time,
and then not always drunk.

791
01:06:34,362 --> 01:06:36,298
Somethin' comes over me.
I get cold sweats.

792
01:06:36,366 --> 01:06:38,300
You're not sorry we got married,
are you?

793
01:06:38,368 --> 01:06:40,301
Of course not!
You're a beautiful woman.

794
01:06:40,368 --> 01:06:43,532
- Do you love me?
- What's this all about?

795
01:06:43,606 --> 01:06:46,734
I'm trying to analyze your feelings
so I can write about them.

796
01:06:46,810 --> 01:06:49,902
I'm your husband.
I'm not some goddamn book idea!

797
01:06:51,112 --> 01:06:53,843
Have you ever cried
over the loss of anyone?

798
01:06:53,916 --> 01:06:56,679
- Your mother, your father?
- Not in me.

799
01:06:56,751 --> 01:06:59,744
You let your insides get to you
and you're finished.

800
01:06:59,822 --> 01:07:03,725
If you just let your feelings out,
you might even play better.

801
01:07:03,793 --> 01:07:05,258
Richer.

802
01:07:05,326 --> 01:07:08,593
Someone else said that to me once.
Everybody knows everything.

803
01:07:08,665 --> 01:07:12,030
I've been trying to analyze what
separates your playing from Django's...

804
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:14,434
and I say it's that
his feelings are richer.

805
01:07:14,504 --> 01:07:18,131
He's not afraid to suffer
in front of anybody.

806
01:07:18,205 --> 01:07:21,402
- He doesn't hold things in check...
- Stop talking about Django!

807
01:07:21,476 --> 01:07:24,912
The guy haunts me. All right?
Enough about Django.

808
01:07:42,897 --> 01:07:44,989
Yeah.

809
01:07:45,065 --> 01:07:48,033
- I want to see Mr. Bedloe.
- Be back in a minute.

810
01:07:48,101 --> 01:07:50,033
Do you mind if I wait?

811
01:07:51,536 --> 01:07:53,473
Got an appointment?

812
01:07:53,540 --> 01:07:55,667
- May I?
- Go ahead.

813
01:07:55,742 --> 01:07:57,175
Nope.

814
01:07:59,178 --> 01:08:01,477
- Who are you?
- I work for him.

815
01:08:03,684 --> 01:08:05,616
I've seen you around.

816
01:08:07,053 --> 01:08:10,956
- You're his strong-arm man.
- He don't need no help.

817
01:08:11,024 --> 01:08:13,854
I saw you beat somebody up
in the alley last week.

818
01:08:16,461 --> 01:08:19,453
- You're the guitar player's wife.
- That's right.

819
01:08:19,532 --> 01:08:21,523
- I noticed you too.
- You did?

820
01:08:21,599 --> 01:08:23,535
Lots of times.

821
01:08:27,707 --> 01:08:29,732
Why does Mr. Bedloe
need a bodyguard?

822
01:08:29,808 --> 01:08:32,242
You come here to ask
for your husband's job back?

823
01:08:32,311 --> 01:08:35,176
Is it true Mr. Bedloe
runs some rackets?

824
01:08:35,245 --> 01:08:37,977
Joe thinks the world of
your husband's guitar playing.

825
01:08:38,050 --> 01:08:40,539
He thinks he's a genius, but...

826
01:08:40,616 --> 01:08:43,315
I mean, let's be honest.
Either he comes in here late...

827
01:08:43,389 --> 01:08:45,514
or he comes in drunk
or he don't come in at all...

828
01:08:45,589 --> 01:08:48,993
and that's no way
to run a nightclub.

829
01:08:49,061 --> 01:08:51,755
I thinkJoe's cooled down.
He was pretty hot the other night.

830
01:08:53,765 --> 01:08:57,564
I hope you don't
mind me asking, but...

831
01:08:57,633 --> 01:08:59,797
you're wearing a gun,
aren't you?

832
01:09:00,906 --> 01:09:02,337
Not me.

833
01:09:03,541 --> 01:09:05,474
Did you ever kill anyone?

834
01:09:15,786 --> 01:09:18,754
Don't tell me that you never
noticed me staring at you.

835
01:09:18,821 --> 01:09:20,756
- No, I...
- You come in here a couple of nights.

836
01:09:20,824 --> 01:09:23,122
I couldn't take my eyes off you.

837
01:09:23,193 --> 01:09:26,163
- Really?
- I love that blue silk dress you wear.

838
01:09:27,664 --> 01:09:30,290
Oh, yes. That... Gee.

839
01:09:32,368 --> 01:09:34,302
It's warm in here.

840
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:39,271
Morning, Mr. Bedloe.

841
01:09:39,342 --> 01:09:42,005
You're a smart girl.
You come from a good home.

842
01:09:42,079 --> 01:09:45,411
What are you doin' with a drunken
guitar player for a husband?

843
01:09:45,481 --> 01:09:48,382
Okay, he's a brilliant musician,
but who can live with him?

844
01:09:48,451 --> 01:09:51,248
Not me.
I'll bet it's no picnic for you.

845
01:09:51,319 --> 01:09:53,449
He wants me to tell you
he's learned his lesson.

846
01:09:53,525 --> 01:09:55,457
Do you think
I was born yesterday?

847
01:09:55,525 --> 01:10:00,292
- I know you think he's great.
- Great? His playin' makes me cry.

848
01:10:00,364 --> 01:10:02,386
Does he bring in customers?
Some.

849
01:10:02,463 --> 01:10:05,901
Mostly aficionados.
When he shows up.

850
01:10:05,968 --> 01:10:09,302
We found him the other night
staring at freight trains at 9:00.

851
01:10:09,373 --> 01:10:11,498
- He's gonna turn over a new leaf.
- Right.

852
01:10:11,573 --> 01:10:13,199
He's through drinkin'.

853
01:10:13,274 --> 01:10:16,073
Right. All right, look.

854
01:10:16,144 --> 01:10:19,409
I'm a soft touch, but I don't
like to be made a fool.

855
01:10:19,481 --> 01:10:24,439
Out of respect for you, who I like,
I'm gonna give him one more shot.

856
01:10:24,518 --> 01:10:27,749
But if you want my advice,
no genius is worth too much heartache.

857
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:36,293
- How'd you do?
- He's such a nice man.

858
01:10:36,363 --> 01:10:38,161
You wanna celebrate?

859
01:10:38,233 --> 01:10:41,200
- Celebrate?
- Yeah, have a drink with me.

860
01:10:41,267 --> 01:10:42,794
Come on.

861
01:10:43,870 --> 01:10:46,204
Well, I guess.

862
01:10:46,272 --> 01:10:48,970
There are a few things
I wouldn't mind finding out.

863
01:10:49,043 --> 01:10:52,532
I'm a writer, and extreme characters
always fascinate me.

864
01:10:52,610 --> 01:10:54,546
I ain't so extreme.

865
01:10:54,615 --> 01:10:56,582
Everybody I ever rubbed out
deserved it.

866
01:10:56,651 --> 01:10:59,244
"Rubbed out"?

867
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:01,345
That's so colorful and...

868
01:11:01,422 --> 01:11:04,290
What goes through your mind
when you're rubbing someone out?

869
01:11:04,359 --> 01:11:06,824
Through my mind?

870
01:11:06,892 --> 01:11:09,590
What do you think about
when you pull the trigger?

871
01:11:09,662 --> 01:11:11,960
Well, I don't know.

872
01:11:12,031 --> 01:11:15,467
Yet you're able
to just shoot someone.

873
01:11:15,536 --> 01:11:18,434
I don't want to shock you, but...

874
01:11:18,503 --> 01:11:20,493
it always came natural to me.

875
01:11:20,573 --> 01:11:21,802
Really?

876
01:11:21,876 --> 01:11:24,672
Ever since I was 15
and I first picked up a gun...

877
01:11:26,079 --> 01:11:29,309
I discovered that
I had a knack for it.

878
01:11:29,381 --> 01:11:32,111
Fascinating.

879
01:11:32,184 --> 01:11:35,449
- What are you doing?
- You have very soft hair.

880
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:37,751
- Don't.
- Why?

881
01:11:37,824 --> 01:11:39,451
I'm scared.

882
01:11:39,525 --> 01:11:41,616
Because I kill for a living.

883
01:11:44,429 --> 01:11:46,726
Because I find you attractive.

884
01:11:58,842 --> 01:12:02,801
Blanche was a writer.
Some kind of a writer.

885
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:05,611
Not famous or anything,
but she was published.

886
01:12:05,684 --> 01:12:09,709
In fact, she wrote a story called...

887
01:12:09,786 --> 01:12:12,187
"Strutting and Fretting."

888
01:12:12,256 --> 01:12:16,420
And it's vaguely about some of the
stormy times she and Emmet were having.

889
01:12:18,894 --> 01:12:21,491
Why am I bored with my husband?

890
01:12:21,567 --> 01:12:23,624
It's all so complicated.

891
01:12:23,701 --> 01:12:26,669
In the end, I married
for the wrong reasons.

892
01:12:26,737 --> 01:12:30,034
And why Emmet rushed into marriage
with me is a mystery.

893
01:12:32,909 --> 01:12:34,844
Five in the corner.

894
01:12:38,414 --> 01:12:41,406
- That's all she wrote.
- Lucky shot.

895
01:12:41,483 --> 01:12:43,679
You couldn't make
that shot again if you tried.

896
01:12:43,754 --> 01:12:46,722
Don't give me that.
Just hand it over.

897
01:12:46,790 --> 01:12:48,849
I'm one of the two, three top
pool players in the country.

898
01:12:48,925 --> 01:12:51,791
No shame in losin' to me.
Thank you very much.

899
01:12:51,861 --> 01:12:54,557
- Come here. I want to talk to you.
- Yeah.

900
01:12:54,633 --> 01:12:57,121
Look, we know each other, right?

901
01:12:57,198 --> 01:12:59,225
I don't like to cause
any problems...

902
01:12:59,302 --> 01:13:01,532
so I wanted to give you
a little tip.

903
01:13:01,605 --> 01:13:03,400
On a horse? Couple of beers.

904
01:13:03,472 --> 01:13:05,963
No, not on a horse.

905
01:13:06,042 --> 01:13:08,507
I want to give you a tip.

906
01:13:08,575 --> 01:13:10,512
Keep an eye on your wife.

907
01:13:10,581 --> 01:13:13,242
- What do you mean?
- Just keep an eye on her.

908
01:13:13,315 --> 01:13:15,145
Why?

909
01:13:15,216 --> 01:13:18,652
Because she's been spendin'
a lot of time with Al Torrio.

910
01:13:20,254 --> 01:13:21,779
Who?

911
01:13:21,857 --> 01:13:24,519
Al Torrio. The hood
that hangs around Bedloe.

912
01:13:24,593 --> 01:13:27,323
The bodyguard? And Blanche?
Are you nuts?

913
01:13:27,396 --> 01:13:30,227
- Just tellin' you what's goin' around.
- What kind of mind you got?

914
01:13:30,297 --> 01:13:33,736
Blanche'd never make a fool outta me
with some strong- arm stooge.

915
01:13:33,802 --> 01:13:35,734
- Where'd you hear this?
- Here and there.

916
01:13:35,802 --> 01:13:38,931
That's why I'm telling you. I didn't
think you'd want people laughin' at you.

917
01:13:39,008 --> 01:13:42,669
Laughin' at me?
You know how rumors get started.

918
01:13:45,013 --> 01:13:49,211
Come on. This is what happens when you
have a wife everybody's envious of.

919
01:13:49,283 --> 01:13:51,443
It's jealousy,
but I'm not the jealous type.

920
01:13:51,518 --> 01:13:54,115
- They're tryin' to knock me down.
- Hope you're right.

921
01:14:12,338 --> 01:14:15,431
I've heard stories about this
from musicians...

922
01:14:15,507 --> 01:14:17,670
I've read about it,
but I don't really know.

923
01:14:17,743 --> 01:14:19,041
I know that...

924
01:14:19,113 --> 01:14:22,945
apparently, Emmet tried
to follow Blanche one day.

925
01:14:23,015 --> 01:14:26,348
I believe she told him she was
going to the dentist or something...

926
01:14:26,418 --> 01:14:28,546
and he followed her.

927
01:15:11,063 --> 01:15:13,087
You gotta go home right away?

928
01:15:13,163 --> 01:15:15,562
I think Emmet's at the poolroom.

929
01:15:15,631 --> 01:15:17,568
Come on.
Let's go for a drive.

930
01:15:22,641 --> 01:15:24,835
You know, I didn't
care too much for that movie.

931
01:15:24,908 --> 01:15:26,932
- No?
- I like Cagney.

932
01:15:27,009 --> 01:15:29,034
Guns, bullets, shootin',
a little action.

933
01:15:30,581 --> 01:15:32,983
How does it feel
when you actually kill?

934
01:15:33,051 --> 01:15:35,643
What goes through your mind?

935
01:15:35,719 --> 01:15:38,186
What do you gotta ask
the questions for all the time?

936
01:15:38,255 --> 01:15:39,552
Because I wanna know.

937
01:15:40,325 --> 01:15:44,658
Emmet has a violent side, but it
all turns to passion in his music.

938
01:15:44,728 --> 01:15:47,890
With you there's just not
a shred of sublimation.

939
01:15:47,965 --> 01:15:49,899
It's incredible.

940
01:15:49,967 --> 01:15:52,060
Let me ask you one question.

941
01:15:52,135 --> 01:15:54,500
Who makes love to you better,
me or him?

942
01:15:55,873 --> 01:15:58,339
Emmet is an artist,
and because he's an artist...

943
01:15:58,406 --> 01:16:00,067
he needs no one.

944
01:16:00,844 --> 01:16:05,837
Even making love, he seems to exist
in a world all of his own.

945
01:16:05,916 --> 01:16:10,409
With you I feel like I'm looking
right into the heart of darkness.

946
01:16:10,485 --> 01:16:13,649
I become crazy when you touch me.

947
01:16:13,723 --> 01:16:14,954
Okay, so now Emmet is fuming.

948
01:16:14,955 --> 01:16:16,187
Okay, so now Emmet is fuming.

949
01:16:16,258 --> 01:16:18,819
I mean, he found out
that Torrio and Blanche...

950
01:16:18,896 --> 01:16:21,657
have gone to bed with each other,
that they're lovers.

951
01:16:21,729 --> 01:16:24,255
And he's consumed with rage.

952
01:16:24,332 --> 01:16:29,327
Now, just at that moment,
Torrio decides to pull off the road...

953
01:16:29,405 --> 01:16:32,065
and go into a gas station
to buy some cigarettes.

954
01:16:32,139 --> 01:16:35,302
And there's Emmet
in the back of the car...

955
01:16:35,376 --> 01:16:38,242
and he's trying very hard to
figure out who he wants to shoot.

956
01:16:38,311 --> 01:16:41,076
Does he want to shoot Blanche?
Torrio?

957
01:16:41,148 --> 01:16:42,808
Should he shoot
both of them together?

958
01:16:42,882 --> 01:16:45,045
He's working on this problem.

959
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:49,146
They go into the store,
and exactly at that moment...

960
01:16:49,222 --> 01:16:51,157
a holdup is taking place.

961
01:16:51,226 --> 01:16:55,754
Two guys come running out.
They don't know what to do.

962
01:16:55,831 --> 01:16:58,229
All hell is breaking loose.
There's gunshots.

963
01:16:58,299 --> 01:17:00,288
Instead of taking their car...

964
01:17:00,365 --> 01:17:03,928
Torrio's got a big car.
They jump in that and pull off.

965
01:17:19,919 --> 01:17:21,977
Calling all cars.

966
01:17:46,045 --> 01:17:47,409
I'm Emmet Ray.

967
01:17:47,479 --> 01:17:49,915
I'm the greatest guitar player
in the world.

968
01:17:49,983 --> 01:17:52,508
Except maybe this gypsy.

969
01:17:52,585 --> 01:17:56,247
Perhaps you heard my recording of
"You Were Meant For Me," RCA Victor.

970
01:17:57,489 --> 01:18:00,684
You were meant for me

971
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:03,010
That's not what I heard.

972
01:18:03,011 --> 01:18:04,061
That's not what I heard.

973
01:18:04,129 --> 01:18:06,462
But like all Emmet Ray stories...

974
01:18:06,531 --> 01:18:10,159
you never know what's made up,
exaggerated, true.

975
01:18:10,234 --> 01:18:13,397
You never know what to believe.
What I heard was this.

976
01:18:13,471 --> 01:18:16,439
I heard that when they
pulled into the gas station...

977
01:18:16,506 --> 01:18:18,875
Blanche gets out
to get some cigarettes...

978
01:18:18,945 --> 01:18:20,876
and that's
when he confronted them.

979
01:18:22,345 --> 01:18:25,908
How could you? How could you
cheat on me with a bum like that?

980
01:18:25,984 --> 01:18:27,006
Emmet, don't!

981
01:18:27,084 --> 01:18:29,246
Make a fool out of me
in front of everybody!

982
01:18:29,321 --> 01:18:32,345
So I slept with him.
But I was just researching a book!

983
01:18:32,421 --> 01:18:33,890
I loved you!

984
01:18:35,326 --> 01:18:37,259
Don't be crazy. Do something!

985
01:18:39,496 --> 01:18:43,023
I'm sorry. My tire blew out.

986
01:18:43,100 --> 01:18:47,432
Believe me, he never tried to kill
himself, because Emmet Ray was...

987
01:18:47,503 --> 01:18:50,906
He had much too much ego
for anything like that.

988
01:18:52,709 --> 01:18:54,733
A story that Eddie Condon
tells about...

989
01:18:54,810 --> 01:18:57,246
And Eddie Condon definitely
was not a reliable source...

990
01:18:57,314 --> 01:18:59,543
'cause he was
a big embellisher himself.

991
01:18:59,615 --> 01:19:03,518
But the story Eddie Condon tells,
I believe...

992
01:19:03,586 --> 01:19:06,348
is that Torrio was aware...

993
01:19:06,422 --> 01:19:10,256
that the fact that he was a gangster
was a big turn- on for Blanche.

994
01:19:10,326 --> 01:19:11,371
And so he decided...

995
01:19:11,372 --> 01:19:12,417
And so he decided...

996
01:19:12,495 --> 01:19:15,588
that he would
pull into this gas station...

997
01:19:15,665 --> 01:19:17,597
and he would stick it up.

998
01:19:23,004 --> 01:19:25,940
- Can I help you, sir?
- Get your hands in the air, Pops.

999
01:19:26,008 --> 01:19:27,668
Give me everything
in the register!

1000
01:19:27,743 --> 01:19:30,713
Emmet was so panicked
by hearing gunshots...

1001
01:19:30,780 --> 01:19:33,748
he crept into the front seat
and took off.

1002
01:19:33,815 --> 01:19:38,514
He didn't get more than 50 feet
before he crashed into an oncoming car.

1003
01:19:38,586 --> 01:19:43,023
Now there's this terrible crash.
Miraculously, no one is hurt.

1004
01:19:43,091 --> 01:19:46,790
And who gets out of the car
but a group of musicians.

1005
01:19:46,862 --> 01:19:48,795
I can't remember who it was.

1006
01:19:48,863 --> 01:19:52,561
It was like Buck Clayton, Coleman
Hawkins, Teddy Wilson or something.

1007
01:19:52,634 --> 01:19:56,730
But there, suddenly,
standing in front of Emmet...

1008
01:19:56,805 --> 01:19:58,736
is Django Reinhardt.

1009
01:20:13,187 --> 01:20:15,781
I believe later that year...

1010
01:20:15,857 --> 01:20:18,381
Emmet turned up in New Jersey...

1011
01:20:18,458 --> 01:20:22,826
and made that recording he did
of one of his own compositions.

1012
01:20:22,894 --> 01:20:24,625
"Unfaithful Woman."

1013
01:20:49,021 --> 01:20:50,715
Very good, everybody.

1014
01:20:50,789 --> 01:20:53,555
- Particularly me.
- That was great. And me.

1015
01:20:53,627 --> 01:20:57,256
- Let's go get somethin' to eat.
- Emmet, we're going to New York.

1016
01:20:57,330 --> 01:21:01,025
We're goin' to New York.
The big money.

1017
01:21:01,099 --> 01:21:03,091
Can I get those cigarettes?

1018
01:21:03,168 --> 01:21:07,194
Em, I tell you, the music business
really picked up, just like you said.

1019
01:21:07,270 --> 01:21:10,729
We got some dancers lined up for
tonight, pretty ones. They are wild.

1020
01:22:01,258 --> 01:22:03,192
How are you?

1021
01:22:06,295 --> 01:22:08,230
You look healthy.

1022
01:22:12,168 --> 01:22:15,331
I'm in town makin' a record.

1023
01:22:15,404 --> 01:22:18,235
I wrote a beautiful tune.
It's a classic.

1024
01:22:21,511 --> 01:22:23,445
I'm sorry I cut out
on you like that.

1025
01:22:24,948 --> 01:22:27,314
It was time to move on.

1026
01:22:27,384 --> 01:22:29,874
I was fair. I told you
not to fall in love with me.

1027
01:22:29,951 --> 01:22:32,442
It's nothin' personal.

1028
01:22:32,521 --> 01:22:34,579
It's just, I'm an artist.

1029
01:22:38,194 --> 01:22:40,925
I like women,
but they gotta have their place.

1030
01:22:45,099 --> 01:22:46,693
You angry with me?

1031
01:22:48,870 --> 01:22:50,496
You have every right to be.

1032
01:22:50,571 --> 01:22:52,540
I don't hold it against you.

1033
01:22:53,709 --> 01:22:55,902
I even thought of you
a couple of times.

1034
01:22:58,813 --> 01:23:01,336
My wife said...

1035
01:23:01,415 --> 01:23:03,406
I said your name once
in my sleep.

1036
01:23:07,289 --> 01:23:09,223
Must have had a nightmare
or somethin'.

1037
01:23:12,058 --> 01:23:13,720
Yeah.

1038
01:23:13,794 --> 01:23:17,822
I had a wife. She's gone now,
and believe me, I don't miss her.

1039
01:23:17,898 --> 01:23:20,061
I don't mean to say
I miss you either...

1040
01:23:20,136 --> 01:23:22,498
but I didn't have
any bad feelings about you.

1041
01:23:26,372 --> 01:23:29,772
We got a real good contract at a club
in New York for a year. Good dough.

1042
01:23:36,050 --> 01:23:39,143
Maybe you'd like to come.

1043
01:23:39,219 --> 01:23:40,684
You know?

1044
01:23:40,751 --> 01:23:43,347
I'm not makin' any promises, but...

1045
01:23:43,423 --> 01:23:45,822
I think you might have fun.

1046
01:23:45,890 --> 01:23:50,191
You'd be in New York with...

1047
01:23:50,262 --> 01:23:53,130
one of the two best
guitar players in the world...

1048
01:23:54,934 --> 01:23:57,163
six best poker players.

1049
01:23:57,234 --> 01:23:59,169
Not countin' that.

1050
01:24:01,572 --> 01:24:03,508
We leave tomorrow, if you want.

1051
01:24:03,576 --> 01:24:05,476
If you don't, I understand.

1052
01:24:05,545 --> 01:24:09,003
You know? Then it'd be
"It was nice seeing you again.

1053
01:24:09,082 --> 01:24:10,516
Good luck."

1054
01:24:13,085 --> 01:24:15,019
I never could
get your handwritin'.

1055
01:24:25,264 --> 01:24:26,696
Happily?

1056
01:24:29,266 --> 01:24:30,699
Got kids?

1057
01:24:35,206 --> 01:24:36,640
Boy or girl?

1058
01:24:38,541 --> 01:24:40,567
Boy?

1059
01:24:40,644 --> 01:24:42,077
Girl?

1060
01:24:47,051 --> 01:24:48,984
It's just as well.

1061
01:24:50,454 --> 01:24:53,855
I wouldn't want to give you the wrong
impression. You'd get attached to me.

1062
01:24:53,923 --> 01:24:56,357
And you know me.
I can't take entanglements.

1063
01:25:00,130 --> 01:25:03,931
I gotta go. We're gonna take
some chorus girls out tonight.

1064
01:25:04,001 --> 01:25:05,936
And I'm leavin' tomorrow.

1065
01:25:09,806 --> 01:25:11,739
Take it easy.

1066
01:26:09,064 --> 01:26:14,125
I'm the greatest solo instrumentalist
on the guitar you'll ever hear.

1067
01:26:14,201 --> 01:26:15,134
Oh, yeah?

1068
01:26:15,203 --> 01:26:18,898
The public's just getting to know my
name. Next year, I'll be in the money.

1069
01:26:20,943 --> 01:26:23,966
You're a real looker.
You are a real looker.

1070
01:26:24,043 --> 01:26:27,275
- You're not that bad yourself.
- I mean it!

1071
01:26:27,347 --> 01:26:30,747
Maybe that's why the men give me
a lot of tips when I dance.

1072
01:26:30,816 --> 01:26:32,615
You wanna go watch trains?

1073
01:26:32,687 --> 01:26:34,152
What?

1074
01:26:34,220 --> 01:26:35,744
- Come on.
- Trains?

1075
01:26:35,823 --> 01:26:37,313
Wait. Where are we going?

1076
01:26:37,391 --> 01:26:40,291
- Jesus.
- Outta the way.

1077
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:42,760
Grab my stuff. Jesus.

1078
01:26:42,827 --> 01:26:45,194
- Where are we going?
- My cigarettes!

1079
01:26:45,264 --> 01:26:47,324
Where do you think
you're taking me?

1080
01:26:50,636 --> 01:26:52,400
Where's my cigarettes?

1081
01:26:52,472 --> 01:26:54,440
Leave them alone.
Let's just go.

1082
01:26:56,175 --> 01:26:59,044
Come on.
Let's go watch trains.

1083
01:27:15,662 --> 01:27:18,926
You almost lost me there, you know.
Did you see that?

1084
01:27:20,030 --> 01:27:22,557
Jesus. What are we doing here?

1085
01:27:22,634 --> 01:27:24,568
I like to sit out...

1086
01:27:25,838 --> 01:27:27,930
and look at the trains pass.

1087
01:27:28,006 --> 01:27:30,530
Yeah. To each his own, I say.

1088
01:27:30,606 --> 01:27:32,633
I mean, I don't understand it.

1089
01:27:32,711 --> 01:27:36,041
I can make my guitar
sound like a train.

1090
01:27:36,112 --> 01:27:39,050
God! I mean, I'm a nice girl.

1091
01:27:39,117 --> 01:27:41,584
I don't understand
why you'd bring me here.

1092
01:27:41,653 --> 01:27:46,022
I can make my guitar
sound just like a train.

1093
01:27:46,090 --> 01:27:49,287
I got a warm room we can go to.

1094
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:51,553
Come on. I'll take care of you.

1095
01:27:51,627 --> 01:27:54,689
Come on. It's nice.

1096
01:27:54,766 --> 01:27:59,669
Jesus, I don't understand why you would
bring a nice girl like me out here.

1097
01:28:02,104 --> 01:28:04,130
I'm takin' requests.

1098
01:28:04,208 --> 01:28:06,142
Do you know "Sweet Sue"?

1099
01:29:44,638 --> 01:29:47,468
All right, are you finished?
Can we go now?

1100
01:29:47,539 --> 01:29:50,738
I really have to pee, you know.
I gotta go to the bathroom.

1101
01:29:52,379 --> 01:29:54,109
- What's the matter with you?
- Go on.

1102
01:29:54,182 --> 01:29:55,512
- What?
- Get outta here.

1103
01:29:55,582 --> 01:29:58,174
What? What are you talk...

1104
01:29:58,250 --> 01:30:00,776
- You dragged me out here.
- Just leave me alone.

1105
01:30:00,853 --> 01:30:02,582
- What?
- Leave me alone!

1106
01:30:02,654 --> 01:30:06,056
I don't need anybody!

1107
01:30:06,125 --> 01:30:09,685
- I made a mistake!
- Yeah. I'll say.

1108
01:30:09,762 --> 01:30:11,195
I made mistake!

1109
01:30:39,458 --> 01:30:41,982
I have no idea
what happened to Emmet Ray.

1110
01:30:42,059 --> 01:30:45,722
He just sort of disappeared,
I guess.

1111
01:30:45,796 --> 01:30:48,526
He did make, though,
in those last couple of years...

1112
01:30:48,599 --> 01:30:51,068
he made really
his best recordings.

1113
01:30:51,135 --> 01:30:53,796
He never played more beautifully,
more movingly.

1114
01:30:55,606 --> 01:30:58,039
Something just seemed
to kind of open up in him.

1115
01:30:58,108 --> 01:31:00,976
It was amazing,
because he was, finally...

1116
01:31:01,045 --> 01:31:03,274
every bit as good
as Django Reinhardt.

1117
01:31:03,346 --> 01:31:07,374
And then he just, you know,
seemed to fade away.

1118
01:31:07,451 --> 01:31:09,384
I mean, I have no idea.

1119
01:31:10,420 --> 01:31:12,388
Some people said
he went to Europe.

1120
01:31:12,456 --> 01:31:17,121
And some people feel that he may
have stopped playing altogether.

1121
01:31:17,195 --> 01:31:21,823
But we do have, fortunately,
those last recordings he made.

1122
01:31:24,299 --> 01:31:27,600
And they're great.
They're absolutely beautiful.
