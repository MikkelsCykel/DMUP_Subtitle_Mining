1
00:00:54,014 --> 00:00:56,642
Fucking hell.

2
00:00:56,684 --> 00:00:58,675
Well, you know,
this is Area 52.

3
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,414
We are filming
the "Sanchez" movie.

4
00:01:00,454 --> 00:01:04,754
So I got this idea, right,
where we proper up the ante.

5
00:01:06,494 --> 00:01:08,758
What we got to do is bollock
right down this field,

6
00:01:08,796 --> 00:01:10,991
we got a massive
football pitch...

7
00:01:11,031 --> 00:01:13,090
and just smash the car
straight for the caravan.

8
00:01:13,134 --> 00:01:14,533
But if you get
in the corner--

9
00:01:14,568 --> 00:01:15,967
If you laid down,
you'd be all right.

10
00:01:16,003 --> 00:01:17,800
No, 'cause you're
the shortest, right?

11
00:01:17,838 --> 00:01:19,328
- Oh yeah, great.
- No no no!

12
00:01:20,374 --> 00:01:21,864
( both shouting )

13
00:01:21,909 --> 00:01:23,604
What if it just goes "plop,"
and mows me over?

14
00:01:23,644 --> 00:01:25,407
- Trust us.
- It's not going to mow you over.

15
00:01:25,446 --> 00:01:26,572
- God.
- We've worked it out.

16
00:01:26,614 --> 00:01:28,013
We've got a tape measure
and everything.

17
00:01:28,048 --> 00:01:30,312
Short man, short life.
Fucking bye!

18
00:01:31,919 --> 00:01:33,511
Go on, Daint,
fuck him up!

19
00:01:33,554 --> 00:01:35,818
I'm tellin' you--
no, it's not happening.

20
00:01:35,856 --> 00:01:38,484
It's not fucking--
end-off, no. Fuckin'...

21
00:01:38,526 --> 00:01:41,188
- Oh, come on, Panch!
- Oh, come on!

22
00:01:41,228 --> 00:01:42,525
Daint, I don't give
a fuck if you've got

23
00:01:42,563 --> 00:01:43,962
a flux capacitor
in that fuckin' car.

24
00:01:43,998 --> 00:01:45,556
I'm not going
in there, right?

25
00:01:48,636 --> 00:01:49,967
Before he fuckin'
wakes up,

26
00:01:50,004 --> 00:01:52,063
let's just bollock it
for the fuckin' caravan,

27
00:01:52,106 --> 00:01:54,370
straight through--
well, off to the corner,

28
00:01:54,408 --> 00:01:57,002
'cause if you go through it,
you'll probably fucking kill him.

29
00:01:57,044 --> 00:02:00,138
Look at Pritch
with his seatbelt on.

30
00:02:00,181 --> 00:02:02,479
( "All My Friends
Are Dead" playing )

31
00:02:02,516 --> 00:02:04,848
- Go on!
- Come on!

32
00:02:04,885 --> 00:02:06,944
# Where are your friends? #

33
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:09,756
# Where are your friends?! #

34
00:02:12,827 --> 00:02:14,852
What?
Don't fuck around!

35
00:02:20,468 --> 00:02:22,129
# What? What? #

36
00:02:22,169 --> 00:02:24,296
# Where are my friends? #

37
00:02:24,338 --> 00:02:26,465
# All my friends
are dead #

38
00:02:26,507 --> 00:02:29,340
# All my
friends are dead #

39
00:02:29,376 --> 00:02:31,606
# Got kicked
in the head #

40
00:02:31,645 --> 00:02:34,478
# All my friends
are dead #

41
00:02:34,515 --> 00:02:37,075
# All my
friends are dead #

42
00:02:37,117 --> 00:02:39,608
# All my friends
are dead #

43
00:02:39,653 --> 00:02:41,280
# They got smacked
in the head #

44
00:02:41,322 --> 00:02:45,053
# All my friends are dead #

45
00:02:45,092 --> 00:02:50,758
# I always knew that they
would end up like today #

46
00:02:50,798 --> 00:02:52,823
# They bought
the bullets #

47
00:02:52,867 --> 00:02:55,392
# And they played
with hand grenades #

48
00:02:55,436 --> 00:02:57,301
# Hey! #

49
00:02:57,338 --> 00:02:59,499
- You fuckin'...
- No, Dainton.

50
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,371
- ...knobber, knobber, knobber.
- Tough fucking shit.

51
00:03:01,408 --> 00:03:03,569
I got fuckin' payback
for once in my fuckin' life.

52
00:03:03,611 --> 00:03:05,909
I put chili sauce in your fuckin' eyes
while you were driving.

53
00:03:05,946 --> 00:03:07,641
Payback? Look where
the fuck we are!

54
00:03:07,681 --> 00:03:09,979
Payback?
We're fucking dead.

55
00:03:10,017 --> 00:03:12,815
- Pritchard: Dead?
- Fuckin' monkeys.

56
00:03:12,853 --> 00:03:14,844
Boys?

57
00:03:14,889 --> 00:03:18,120
I have a little proposal
for you fellas.

58
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:20,626
I want you to go
on a mission

59
00:03:20,661 --> 00:03:23,027
throughout the world
to wreak havoc,

60
00:03:23,063 --> 00:03:25,190
inflict pain

61
00:03:25,232 --> 00:03:26,927
and, most importantly of all,

62
00:03:26,967 --> 00:03:30,733
commit the seven
deadly sins.

63
00:03:30,771 --> 00:03:33,171
If you succeed,

64
00:03:33,207 --> 00:03:35,505
I'll give you
your lives back.

65
00:03:35,543 --> 00:03:39,240
Fail and I'm afraid
this is it, lads--

66
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,713
the end of the road.

67
00:03:40,748 --> 00:03:43,581
So go forth and sin.

68
00:03:43,617 --> 00:03:46,586
I'll see you on the flipside.

69
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,178
( farts )

70
00:03:48,822 --> 00:03:50,881
( all laugh )

( choir singing )

74
00:04:00,568 --> 00:04:02,058
Dainton:
According to Dante,

75
00:04:02,102 --> 00:04:05,697
sloth deadens
the spiritual senses.

76
00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:07,639
But according to "Dainto,"

77
00:04:07,675 --> 00:04:11,133
sloth is the epitome
of man...

78
00:04:11,178 --> 00:04:13,009
that is Pancho.

79
00:04:13,047 --> 00:04:15,538
( heart monitor beeping )

80
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:17,744
Welcome to the "Sanchez"
sleep trials.

81
00:04:17,785 --> 00:04:19,252
Step one...

82
00:04:19,286 --> 00:04:21,618
( sucking )

83
00:04:21,655 --> 00:04:23,088
...Superglue.

84
00:04:23,123 --> 00:04:24,715
( snoring )

85
00:04:29,663 --> 00:04:31,654
Number one.

86
00:04:35,402 --> 00:04:37,267
His mouth.

87
00:04:37,304 --> 00:04:39,636
( heart monitor
beeping )

88
00:04:51,318 --> 00:04:54,515
Whoa whoa whoa
whoa whoa-- whoa whoa.

89
00:04:54,555 --> 00:04:56,716
As you can see,
he's quite agitated.

90
00:04:56,757 --> 00:04:58,782
( beeping quickens )

91
00:04:58,826 --> 00:05:00,453
Feels like
I've got fuckin'

92
00:05:00,494 --> 00:05:02,985
serious shit
up my nose.

93
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:05,089
Joycey: Watch out,
you got stuff-- medicine--

94
00:05:05,132 --> 00:05:06,326
you've got this stuff
on your head.

95
00:05:06,367 --> 00:05:07,857
Watch out,
watch out, don't --

96
00:05:07,901 --> 00:05:11,667
Proof that this man
can fall asleep anywhere in the world.

97
00:05:11,705 --> 00:05:13,832
Someone's fuckin'
glued my nose up.

98
00:05:13,874 --> 00:05:15,364
( laughing )

99
00:05:15,409 --> 00:05:18,401
- My nose is fuckin'...
- Superglued shut.

100
00:05:18,445 --> 00:05:20,777
- ( all laughing )
- Try to blow it out.

101
00:05:25,352 --> 00:05:28,219
It is proper stuck on,
though, isn't it?

102
00:05:30,357 --> 00:05:32,120
It's going
fuckin' nowhere.

103
00:05:33,927 --> 00:05:36,157
That's reinforced, that is.

104
00:05:36,196 --> 00:05:38,664
What happens if I get
a Never-Ending Gobstopper

105
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:41,668
stuck in the back of
my throat? I'm fucked.

106
00:05:41,702 --> 00:05:43,067
Ooh.

107
00:05:43,103 --> 00:05:45,970
( straining to exhale )

108
00:05:46,006 --> 00:05:47,132
( groans )

109
00:05:47,174 --> 00:05:48,664
It's coming, it's coming,
it's coming, it's coming.

110
00:05:48,709 --> 00:05:50,199
- It's com-- it's coming.
- It's not.

111
00:05:50,244 --> 00:05:51,575
- It's snot.
- It's coming.

112
00:05:51,612 --> 00:05:54,012
- It's not!
- It's snot.

113
00:05:54,048 --> 00:05:55,845
Give me that.
I'll fucking do it myself.

114
00:05:55,883 --> 00:05:57,748
God, you kids will
do some stupid things.

115
00:05:57,785 --> 00:05:59,616
- You'll soon find it's rock hard.
- Oh, he's in.

116
00:05:59,653 --> 00:06:02,622
- Three, two, one.
- Ow!

117
00:06:02,656 --> 00:06:04,123
Yes, it's gone!

118
00:06:04,158 --> 00:06:06,126
Oh, you got snot on me.

119
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,754
Am I sorry of sloth?
Am I? Fuck.

120

Joycey:
The rich.

122
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,638
Now they're a bunch
of funny fuckers.

123
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,705
- Oh!
- Get him, get him, get him.

124
00:06:28,749 --> 00:06:30,512
What do they do
to get off their asses?

125
00:06:30,551 --> 00:06:32,678
( all screaming )

126
00:06:35,989 --> 00:06:37,217
Pull!

127
00:06:40,194 --> 00:06:41,786
( all laughing )

128
00:06:41,829 --> 00:06:45,128
I've gone fuckin' deaf.
I can't fuckin' hear nothing.

129
00:06:51,338 --> 00:06:53,363
This is rabbits.
This is what the toffs like to do

130
00:06:53,407 --> 00:06:54,999
when the peasants
step onto their land.

131
00:06:57,911 --> 00:06:59,742
Go for the bollocks.

132
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:02,715
( screaming )
My fuckin' nuts!

133
00:07:03,917 --> 00:07:06,181
- Oh, fuck!
- It's a go.

134
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,915
Run, rabbit,
run, rabbit, run run run!

135
00:07:08,989 --> 00:07:10,957
- Let's have it.
- Ow!

136
00:07:10,991 --> 00:07:14,654
- Ah!
- Oh! Oh!

137
00:07:14,695 --> 00:07:16,390
- Oh!
- Ah!

138
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:18,864
Um, what the fuck
am I doing?

139
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:21,197
Aha! Ah!

140
00:07:21,235 --> 00:07:23,396
- Ah!
- Ow!

141
00:07:23,437 --> 00:07:26,497
Oh, right in
my bunny boobs!

142
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:29,008
Ah! Fuck!

143
00:07:29,042 --> 00:07:31,340
Oh! I want no--
fuck that!

144
00:07:31,378 --> 00:07:33,005
Fuck!

145
00:07:33,046 --> 00:07:36,106
- Right on the ankle-- fuckin' boom.
- ( all laughing )

- I can't fuckin' walk, Dan.

# Know what I mean? #

150
00:07:50,831 --> 00:07:53,800
This is a challenge
to see who's the laziest,

151
00:07:53,834 --> 00:07:55,233
who's the most stupid,

152
00:07:55,269 --> 00:07:56,930
who can take
the most amount of pain

153
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:58,562
without leaving
their La-Z-Boy.

154
00:07:58,605 --> 00:08:00,470
Let's see how lazy Pritchard is.

155
00:08:00,507 --> 00:08:03,476
- Do it.
- Oh I can't, it's not working.

156
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,239
- Joking.

- ( laughing )
- Ah. It's fuckin' so much agony, man.

- Fuckin'- -
- Oh, Christ!

161
00:08:19,827 --> 00:08:21,522
- Right, you ready?
- Yeah.

162
00:08:21,562 --> 00:08:25,054
Ah! Cha cha cha
cha cha cha!

163
00:08:25,098 --> 00:08:28,898
Cha-da da da da! Oh!

164
00:08:28,936 --> 00:08:30,597
- ( men laughing )
- "Da da da!"

165
00:08:30,637 --> 00:08:32,434
( groans )

166
00:08:34,908 --> 00:08:36,500
I lost the La-Z-Boy challenge

167
00:08:36,543 --> 00:08:38,272
so it's cock action time.

168
00:08:38,312 --> 00:08:39,939
( all laughing )

169
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:43,347
- Oh, look at him!
- He's got grey hairs.

170
00:08:43,383 --> 00:08:45,146
He's got grey hairs
on his pubes.

171
00:08:45,185 --> 00:08:46,652
Oh, am I really
gonna do this?

172
00:08:46,687 --> 00:08:48,814
- How am I going to perform?
- Get on with it!

173
00:08:48,856 --> 00:08:51,825
- Just get on with it!
- All: Oh!

174
00:08:51,859 --> 00:08:54,851
Three, two, one!

175
00:08:54,895 --> 00:08:57,227
Oh, God!

176
00:08:57,264 --> 00:09:00,631
I pressed the trigger,
it didn't go!

177
00:09:00,667 --> 00:09:03,568
- Three, two, one.
- ( fires )

178
00:09:07,307 --> 00:09:10,367
Another.
Do another one!

179
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:12,878
I'm not gonna--
I won't, I won't, I won't!

180
00:09:12,913 --> 00:09:15,575
Boys, you want
to see it?

181
00:09:15,616 --> 00:09:18,551
Oh, no no!

182
00:09:25,585 --> 00:09:29,419
- ( shot fires )
- ( screams )

183
00:09:29,456 --> 00:09:31,253
You're dead!

184
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:33,316
You're dead,
you're dead!

185
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,090
I'm dead.
Pritchard versus Dainton.

186
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:40,897
He is dead.
( laughing )

187
00:09:40,934 --> 00:09:43,061
Three, oh...

188
00:09:43,103 --> 00:09:45,628
two, one.

189
00:09:45,672 --> 00:09:47,435
( laughing )

190
00:09:50,644 --> 00:09:53,238
Ah!

191
00:09:57,317 --> 00:09:59,683
I didn't think
it would hurt my skull.

192
00:09:59,719 --> 00:10:00,981
# You know what I mean? #

193
00:10:03,056 --> 00:10:04,284
# You know
what I mean? #

194
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:11,490
Ah!

195
00:10:11,531 --> 00:10:13,089
Taught you then.

196
00:10:13,133 --> 00:10:14,794
- Watch it.
- Hey!

197
00:10:14,834 --> 00:10:16,461
Don't mess around!

198
00:10:19,539 --> 00:10:21,632
- Rah!
- ( screams )

199
00:10:21,675 --> 00:10:24,974
You freak!

200
00:10:25,011 --> 00:10:27,002
- You pig!
- Keep crying, keep crying.

201
00:10:30,684 --> 00:10:35,144
- Holy fuck!
- It went in. It went in my finger.

202
00:10:35,188 --> 00:10:37,418
Right on my nail!

203
00:10:37,457 --> 00:10:39,618
Daint, you fuckin' penis!

204
00:10:39,659 --> 00:10:42,093
- Dainton: Jesus Christ.
- Fuckin' penis licker!

205
00:10:42,128 --> 00:10:44,494
Knew I shouldn't have
fuckin' trusted you.

206
00:10:44,531 --> 00:10:46,158
Oh, I'm gonna faint.

207
00:10:46,199 --> 00:10:48,030
Don't play fuckin'
darts with Dainton.

208
00:10:48,068 --> 00:10:50,127
( echoing )
Right in the fuckin' nail.

209
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:52,035
Right in
the fuckin' nail.

210
00:10:52,072 --> 00:10:53,733
Twat!

211
00:10:53,773 --> 00:10:56,333
# All you lovely ladies #

212
00:10:56,376 --> 00:10:59,402
# You're lookin'
fuckin' fine #

213
00:10:59,446 --> 00:11:02,108
# You're looking fuckin' fine. #

214
00:11:02,148 --> 00:11:03,376
Joycey:
You can't drink that.

215
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:06,044
So what about
a rogue finger?

216
00:11:06,086 --> 00:11:08,418
Here we go--
big or small, fuck 'em all.

217
00:11:08,455 --> 00:11:10,150
( men laughing )

218
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:12,590
( Joycey's voice echoing )
So what about a rogue finger?

219
00:11:15,325 --> 00:11:16,986
This is just
a quick example

220
00:11:17,027 --> 00:11:19,257
of whether I'm proper
slothed out or not.

221
00:11:19,296 --> 00:11:22,129
- Stretch it a bit more.
- Dainton: Come on!

222
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:24,794
# Kick back
recline... #

223
00:11:24,835 --> 00:11:27,099
# Make her move
your waistline... #

224
00:11:31,137 --> 00:11:33,605
But there's no way
I will fuck with him now.

225
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:37,076
Pancho:
#You're lookin' fuckin fine... #

226
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,510
I'm gonna shoot
sloth to anger

227
00:11:39,546 --> 00:11:41,571
in one easy move.

228
00:11:42,649 --> 00:11:44,310
( Joycey laughing )

229
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:46,181
Shh, he's going green.

230
00:11:50,123 --> 00:11:51,784
Shh.

231
00:11:55,261 --> 00:11:56,421
( growls )

232
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:03,667
Right, if we're gonna try and turn
Pancho into "The Incredible Hulk,"

233
00:12:03,703 --> 00:12:05,603
we need to cut
his clothes up.

234
00:12:14,781 --> 00:12:16,874
We've been trying to
do this for five years.

235
00:12:23,189 --> 00:12:25,180
There's something
I draw the line at.

236
00:12:25,225 --> 00:12:26,783
Jim Hickey: What?

237
00:12:26,826 --> 00:12:28,521
- There's no way--
- ( men laughing )

238
00:12:28,561 --> 00:12:31,724
Stop it, that's
fuckin' male-- stop it.

239
00:12:31,765 --> 00:12:33,995
- Fucking stop it.
- Jim: What are they doing?

240
00:12:34,033 --> 00:12:35,898
- Joycey: That's fuckin' funny, man.
- Not funny.

241
00:12:35,935 --> 00:12:37,732
- Shut up.
- Jim: What are they doing?

242
00:12:37,771 --> 00:12:39,261
- Shh.
- Jim: What are they doing?

243
00:12:39,305 --> 00:12:41,330
I'm not gonna--
I'm not-- shh!

244
00:12:41,374 --> 00:12:42,671
I'm not-- shut up!

245
00:12:42,709 --> 00:12:44,370
I'm not gonna tell you
what they're doing.

246
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:46,037
But you never thought
the Incredible Hulk--

247
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,512
I leave it
to your imagination.

248
00:12:51,547 --> 00:12:53,310
Pritchard: Panch!

249
00:12:53,349 --> 00:12:56,011
The sloth to anger,
in one easy move.

250
00:12:57,119 --> 00:13:01,317
- ( squirting )
- Dainton: My God.

251
00:13:01,357 --> 00:13:03,689
Pritch,
you got his eyes.

252
00:13:03,726 --> 00:13:04,920
What?

253
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,757
You got
his fuckin' eyes.

254
00:13:06,796 --> 00:13:08,195
Yeah, but it's
watered down.

255
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:10,323
You're fucked now.
You've fucked it.

256
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:14,667
Oh, fuck off.
You're staying here.

257
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,298
That's bullshit.

258
00:13:25,181 --> 00:13:26,478
Fuck off.

259
00:13:32,688 --> 00:13:35,782
Is there a prob--
is there a problem here?

260
00:13:35,825 --> 00:13:37,759
Don't fuckin' have
a go at me, mate.

261
00:13:37,793 --> 00:13:39,454
It's naught
to do with me.

262
00:13:39,495 --> 00:13:41,520
It's nothing
to do with me.

263
00:13:41,564 --> 00:13:43,759
Pancho:
Jim, it's fuckin' all to do with you.

264
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:47,257
- It's not to do with me.
- Joycey: It's not Jim, it's not Jim.

265
00:13:47,303 --> 00:13:50,067
Pritchard:
Leave Jim alone.

266
00:13:55,244 --> 00:13:58,805
He doesn't even know
he looks like the Hulk.

267
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:02,850
I'm green-- great.

268
00:14:04,787 --> 00:14:06,584
( roaring )

269
00:14:10,326 --> 00:14:12,317
( dramatic music playing )

270
00:14:23,939 --> 00:14:25,930
( film projector clicking )

271
00:14:52,034 --> 00:14:54,229
- Ah!
- Oh!

272
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:56,295
- Oh!
- Ahhh!

273
00:14:56,338 --> 00:14:59,705
- There he is-- Paul Weller.
- Jim: What's a Paul Weller?

274
00:14:59,742 --> 00:15:01,039
It just wells up.

275
00:15:01,076 --> 00:15:02,805
( Pancho snoring )

276
00:15:02,845 --> 00:15:05,837
Dainton: Of all the things
that go bump in the night...

277
00:15:07,549 --> 00:15:09,073
that's Daint.

278
00:15:09,118 --> 00:15:11,382
Daddy's here!
( laughs )

279
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,949
( snoring )

280
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:21,050
( cries )

281
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,024
( high-pitched )
Ow!

282
00:15:27,067 --> 00:15:29,262
( all laughing )

283
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:31,396
There's one thing that
really fuckin' makes me angry,

284
00:15:31,438 --> 00:15:33,463
and that's his
fuckin' snoring.

285
00:15:39,012 --> 00:15:41,708
( gasps )

286
00:15:41,749 --> 00:15:43,478
Dainton:
Time for a sleep, Panch.

287
00:15:43,517 --> 00:15:45,678
Come on, boy.
Come to Daddy.

288
00:15:45,719 --> 00:15:47,619
Come on!

289
00:15:52,323 --> 00:15:54,291
( buzzing )

290
00:15:54,325 --> 00:15:56,885
My motto in life is
"Sleep when you're dead."

291
00:15:56,928 --> 00:16:00,261
So I decided to come
to a tattooist in Russia

292
00:16:00,298 --> 00:16:03,096
and have "Sleep when you're dead"
tattooed on my leg in Russian.

293
00:16:03,134 --> 00:16:05,568
There's a thousand ways
to make Pritchard angry.

294
00:16:05,603 --> 00:16:07,798
But sometimes it's the
most simplest of things

295
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:10,205
that can make a man
go fuckin' insane.

296
00:16:10,241 --> 00:16:12,766
It takes a lot to
make me angry basically.

297
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:15,973
Somebody will really have
to keep tap-tap pushing

298
00:16:16,014 --> 00:16:18,380
to make-- make...

299
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:20,907
Can Pritchard
spin that coin

300
00:16:20,952 --> 00:16:23,819
for plus 19 and
a half seconds dead?

301
00:16:23,855 --> 00:16:25,982
One--
oh, shit.

302
00:16:26,024 --> 00:16:27,958
My relationship
with Dainton--

303
00:16:27,992 --> 00:16:30,324
I think that's
the only thing that properly

304
00:16:30,361 --> 00:16:32,488
drives me fuckin'
angry-- Dainton.

305
00:16:33,998 --> 00:16:36,091
Pritchard is coming
tomorrow morning to get a tattoo--

306
00:16:36,134 --> 00:16:38,102
"Sleep when you're dead" --
done on his leg.

307
00:16:38,136 --> 00:16:41,196
Those words are gonna get lost
in translation with my translator.

308
00:16:41,239 --> 00:16:43,002
Don't get me wrong,
I love it.

309
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:45,635
It's brilliant. That's the whole
Pritchard-versus-Dainton thing.

310
00:16:45,677 --> 00:16:47,736
Let's wake
this little piggy up.

311
00:16:50,415 --> 00:16:53,111
If there's anyone that properly
does make me angry, it's Dainton.

312
00:16:56,721 --> 00:16:59,281
Not even himself makes me angry,
it's just the way he does things.

313
00:16:59,324 --> 00:17:01,121
Daint,
you are a ring nut.

314
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:03,821
It's always a competition
between me and him,

315
00:17:03,861 --> 00:17:05,920
but he always gets
the upper hand.

316
00:17:05,963 --> 00:17:07,828
I want "Sleep
when I'm dead,"

317
00:17:07,865 --> 00:17:11,096
but you need to say,
when you translate it...

318
00:17:11,135 --> 00:17:13,365
( tattoo needle buzzes )

319
00:17:13,404 --> 00:17:16,032
He knows-- he knows
where my breaking point is...

320
00:17:19,777 --> 00:17:22,769
and when he knows he's reached
that breaking point with me,

321
00:17:22,814 --> 00:17:24,577
he will--

322
00:17:24,615 --> 00:17:26,515
he knows
to back off then.

323
00:17:26,551 --> 00:17:28,576
- Fucking prick!
- ( laughs )

324
00:17:28,619 --> 00:17:31,349
- Fuck you.
- You fuckin' punched me in the face.

325
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:35,016
"Sleep when you're dead"
in Russian.

326
00:17:35,059 --> 00:17:37,323
Right on.
It must really mean "Beef Stroganoff

327
00:17:37,362 --> 00:17:40,126
and a lovely vodka,
thank you very much," but there we go.

328
00:17:40,164 --> 00:17:41,563
- Spasibo.
- Ne za chto.

329
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:44,432
This is
gonna fuck him up.

330
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:47,461
Pritchard: Well, we're in
a paintball shooting place.

331
00:17:47,505 --> 00:17:50,167
I'm going to attempt--
and when I say attempt--

332
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:52,506
attempt to try and beat
the world record

333
00:17:52,543 --> 00:17:55,068
of the amount of paintball hits
to a human body.

334
00:17:55,113 --> 00:17:56,603
Right, this is a test

335
00:17:56,647 --> 00:17:59,241
to show you how powerful
these guns are

336
00:17:59,283 --> 00:18:01,513
that he's gonna be shot with
to break the world record.

337
00:18:01,552 --> 00:18:02,576
Hit the bin.

338
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,281
( echoes )

339
00:18:04,322 --> 00:18:06,916
From my experience of
being hit by a paintball--

340
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:08,653
naked, before,

341
00:18:08,693 --> 00:18:10,183
in previous years--

342
00:18:10,228 --> 00:18:12,662
it's absolutely
fuckin' painful as fuck.

343
00:18:12,697 --> 00:18:16,724
103 of those to break
the world record.

344
00:18:16,768 --> 00:18:18,736
But there isn't even
a world record.

345
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:20,397
( shot echoes )

346
00:18:20,438 --> 00:18:23,236
Right, "Thank you for your interest
in the paintball hits record

347
00:18:23,274 --> 00:18:26,266
featured in the 2004 edition
of 'T he Guinness World Records.'

348
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:28,778
The record is currently
held by Anthony Kelly" --

349
00:18:28,813 --> 00:18:30,178
that's the man
you got to beat--

350
00:18:30,214 --> 00:18:33,513
- "of New South Wales..."
- All: Oh!

351
00:18:33,551 --> 00:18:37,180
Maybe there'll be a new record
from the New South Wales.

352
00:18:37,221 --> 00:18:39,246
"...in Australia,
who took 102 hits

353
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:42,054
from a distance
of five meters.

354
00:18:42,093 --> 00:18:44,425
I have enclosed
a record-attempt registration

355
00:18:44,462 --> 00:18:46,555
from which our terms
and conditions..." blah blah blah.

356
00:18:46,597 --> 00:18:48,394
"I wish you best of luck
in your record attempt

357
00:18:48,433 --> 00:18:50,128
and look forward
to hearing from you soon.

358
00:18:50,168 --> 00:18:52,227
Yours truly,
Gerald Davey."

359
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:54,830
I can actually properly be
in "The Guinness Book of Records."

360
00:18:54,872 --> 00:18:56,897
- All: Yeah.
- I never knew it was that official.

361
00:18:56,941 --> 00:18:58,738
- Yeah.
- Fuckin' hell.

362
00:18:58,776 --> 00:19:02,906
Oh my God. I've fuckin'
made me even more nervous.

363
00:19:02,947 --> 00:19:04,312
You ready to roll,
Pritchard?

364
00:19:04,348 --> 00:19:06,873
- Yes, Daint!
- Come on!

365
00:19:06,918 --> 00:19:09,011
( Joycey shouting)

366
00:19:11,289 --> 00:19:14,781
- ( screams )
- Pancho: 10 down.

367
00:19:14,826 --> 00:19:16,987
- Joycey: 10.
- Dainton: 92 to go!

368
00:19:17,028 --> 00:19:18,962
Joycey:
Come on, Math, you can do it!

369
00:19:18,996 --> 00:19:20,759
Dainton:
Feel the pain.

370
00:19:20,798 --> 00:19:23,198
Oh, Jesus fuckin'- -
fuck a duck.

371
00:19:23,234 --> 00:19:25,794
- Go!
- ( paintball gun firing )

372
00:19:27,605 --> 00:19:28,629
( shooting stops )

373
00:19:28,673 --> 00:19:31,039
- How many?
- 10, 10.

374
00:19:31,075 --> 00:19:33,270
20!

375
00:19:33,311 --> 00:19:37,338
Dainton:...two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, 10.

376
00:19:37,381 --> 00:19:39,178
Ah!

377
00:19:39,217 --> 00:19:42,584
Oh, that fuckin' Anthony Kelly's
a fucking right thick cunt.

378
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:45,851
...three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, 10.

379
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:46,914
Oh!

380
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:48,152
51, 52...

381
00:19:52,363 --> 00:19:54,160
- Panch, you fuckin' missed.
- A lot of those missed.

382
00:19:54,198 --> 00:19:56,496
- Fuck!
- Have you been drinking?

383
00:19:56,534 --> 00:19:58,468
- I haven't.
- You said you missed three,

384
00:19:58,503 --> 00:19:59,902
- but now you've missed two.
- Two or three.

385
00:19:59,937 --> 00:20:01,564
Well, make your mind up.

386
00:20:01,606 --> 00:20:03,665
This is a world record attempt
we're breaking, motherfucker.

387
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:05,869
- You can't have more miss.
- I got hit with three.

388
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:07,810
I felt three--
I was counting them.

389
00:20:07,845 --> 00:20:10,177
- Ready? Three, two, one.
- Yeah.

390
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,711
- Ah!
- Shoot!

391
00:20:16,921 --> 00:20:18,752
- Oh!
- Come on!

392
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:22,088
You look like fuckin'
King Kong spunked on you.

393
00:20:22,126 --> 00:20:24,856
Ah!

394
00:20:24,896 --> 00:20:28,024
Ay-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya!
Fuckin' 90!

395
00:20:28,065 --> 00:20:30,431
- Ah!
- One, two, three, four, five, six,

396
00:20:30,468 --> 00:20:33,130
- seven, eight, nine, 10!
- Ah!

397
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:35,570
I only need another three,
I've fuckin' done it.

398
00:20:35,606 --> 00:20:37,733
Four.

399
00:20:37,775 --> 00:20:41,609
The record's 102.
I only need 103.

400
00:20:41,646 --> 00:20:43,841
Only three more and
I've fuckin' beaten it.

401
00:20:43,881 --> 00:20:46,042
I'm in that fuckin'
great book, baby!

402
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:48,210
- Whoo! Yeah!
- ( all cheering )

403
00:20:48,252 --> 00:20:51,312
For being
a right stupid twat!

404
00:20:51,355 --> 00:20:54,256
Come on, Pritch!
Here we go, to victory!

405
00:20:54,292 --> 00:20:56,954
Three, two, one!

406
00:20:56,994 --> 00:20:59,929
( all cheer )

407
00:20:59,964 --> 00:21:02,228
Fucking done it!

408
00:21:02,266 --> 00:21:04,427
Yeah!

409
00:21:06,971 --> 00:21:10,270
World record holder--
103 paintballs to the body.

410
00:21:10,308 --> 00:21:13,300
Kelly, kiss my ass,
you did 102.

411
00:21:13,344 --> 00:21:15,107
Jim:
Maybe it's gone too far?

412
00:21:15,146 --> 00:21:17,842
Well, Jim, it's gone too far.
He looks like he's been hit--

413
00:21:17,882 --> 00:21:19,873
he looks like he's been hit
by a fuckin' truck.

414
00:21:19,917 --> 00:21:24,445
He's ecstatic. He said,
"I can't wait to phone my mom."

415
00:21:24,488 --> 00:21:26,285
To tell you the truth...

416
00:21:26,324 --> 00:21:28,224
when I realized
I'd broken the record,

417
00:21:28,259 --> 00:21:29,920
I mean obviously I knew
in my head, I've broken a record,

418
00:21:29,961 --> 00:21:31,826
I was really excited--
I was jumping around telling...

419
00:21:31,862 --> 00:21:34,194
Crew, I've done it!

420
00:21:34,231 --> 00:21:35,664
( mumbles )
Shit.

421
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,429
I mean, as a kid,
you always read

422
00:21:37,468 --> 00:21:39,561
"The Guinness Book
of Records"

423
00:21:39,604 --> 00:21:41,299
when you have it for Christmas
or something like that.

424
00:21:41,339 --> 00:21:42,897
You immediately think,
"Oh, I'd love to be in this book."

425
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:45,932
But, now I'm finally
gonna make it in the book.

426
00:21:45,977 --> 00:21:47,205
You all right, Math?

427
00:21:47,244 --> 00:21:49,804
Pritchard: Boys, you wanna see
the state of my fuckin' body?

428
00:21:49,847 --> 00:21:51,781
- Let's have a look.
- Pritchard: It's fucked.

429
00:21:51,816 --> 00:21:53,784
- Give us a ganders.
- Fuckin' ready?

430
00:21:53,818 --> 00:21:56,480
- Let's have a look.
- Oh my God!

431
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,215
Oh my fuckin' shit-flaps.

432
00:21:58,255 --> 00:22:00,746
Oh my-- oh my God,
look at that.

433
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:03,089
Look at how savage it is.
They're all raised up.

434
00:22:03,127 --> 00:22:04,992
Joycey:
Oh, it's fucking hell, man.

435
00:22:05,029 --> 00:22:08,055
Look at that fucker!
Oh my God!

436
00:22:08,099 --> 00:22:10,932
Fuck me!
Look at that.

437
00:22:10,968 --> 00:22:13,664
That's fucked.
I can't even look at it.

438
00:22:13,704 --> 00:22:16,605
That's the good thing
about skin, boys. It fuckin' heals.

439
00:22:16,641 --> 00:22:19,633
I've always said, whoever invented it
was a fuckin' genius.

440
00:22:19,677 --> 00:22:22,475
( Joycey laughs )

441
00:22:22,513 --> 00:22:24,344
I've never seen
anything like that.

442
00:22:24,382 --> 00:22:26,543
I've never seen so much
fuckin' carnage on one body

443
00:22:26,584 --> 00:22:28,415
after paintballs.

444
00:22:28,452 --> 00:22:32,354
And when he finds out that-- when
he finds out there's no world record--

445
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:34,119
I made it up on
the computer last night--

446
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:39,296
I'm seriously, seriously in some
seriously deep shit.

447
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:41,924
Pancho: Yeah, you know,
Pritchard's fuckin' shaved my hair off

448
00:22:41,966 --> 00:22:44,594
fucking God knows
what so many times.

449
00:22:44,635 --> 00:22:46,933
He deserves
to be tucked up.

450
00:22:50,574 --> 00:22:53,372
That'll teach the fucker
to fuckin' snore.

451
00:22:53,411 --> 00:22:54,742
( snoring )

452
00:22:54,779 --> 00:22:55,973
( buzzing )

453
00:23:02,753 --> 00:23:06,211
( snoring stops )

454
00:23:09,193 --> 00:23:10,956
Breathe.

455
00:23:10,995 --> 00:23:13,896
( snoring )

456
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:21,231
Both:
#Ay ay ay. #

457
00:23:24,341 --> 00:23:26,434
Now we have
the peacemaker,

458
00:23:26,477 --> 00:23:27,876
Mikhail Gorbachev.

459
00:23:31,816 --> 00:23:34,808
( muttering )

460
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:45,385
Right, that is it.

461
00:23:46,764 --> 00:23:49,198
Right-- fuck.

462
00:23:49,233 --> 00:23:51,428
- Pancho.
- What?

463
00:23:51,469 --> 00:23:52,959
- What's wrong with you?
- What do you mean,

464
00:23:53,003 --> 00:23:54,129
"What's wrong with you?"

465
00:24:00,077 --> 00:24:01,874
Look at his long johns

466
00:24:01,912 --> 00:24:04,176
You-- you knew
it was gonna--

467
00:24:04,215 --> 00:24:06,274
Don't punch me.

468
00:24:08,285 --> 00:24:10,583
Oh, just punch me.
Go on, punch me.

469
00:24:10,621 --> 00:24:12,748
- Right.
- Punch me. Go on, punch me.

470
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:14,189
Oh!

471
00:24:15,626 --> 00:24:17,025
Whoa.

472
00:24:19,864 --> 00:24:23,061
He's gonna have a shit on him.
He's having a shit on him!

473
00:24:24,068 --> 00:24:25,797
You're fucking dead.

474
00:24:25,836 --> 00:24:27,929
This is Russia,
this was anger.

475
00:24:27,972 --> 00:24:30,338
He semi-knocked
me out then.

476
00:24:30,374 --> 00:24:32,865
Fuck this place, right?
This place is so full of anger,

477
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:34,104
I need some love.

478
00:24:34,145 --> 00:24:36,340
Let me...

479
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,677
Come in here, Dainton!

480
00:24:37,715 --> 00:24:39,979
Oh ho!
I love-- whoa!

481
00:24:40,017 --> 00:24:41,882
Get off me!

482
00:24:42,086 --> 00:24:45,021
Take me to Thailand
for the ladyboys.

483
00:24:45,055 --> 00:24:49,082
Girl:
Dirty boys!

484
00:24:49,126 --> 00:24:50,787
Come inside.

485
00:24:50,828 --> 00:24:53,456
( pop music playing )

486
00:24:57,134 --> 00:24:59,125
( film projector clicking )

487
00:25:01,572 --> 00:25:03,301
( buzzing )

488
00:25:09,713 --> 00:25:12,375
Woman:
Dirty boys!

489
00:25:21,258 --> 00:25:22,418
# Oooh! #

490
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:27,830
# Dirty boys! #

491
00:25:44,815 --> 00:25:46,783
"I love Dainton."

492
00:25:46,817 --> 00:25:49,183
He's gonna
go fuckin' nuts.

493
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:52,087
Right, we're in Bangkok.

494
00:25:52,122 --> 00:25:53,919
Bit of a ghetto area.

495
00:25:53,958 --> 00:25:56,358
Per pound, you can get
liposuction done here.

496
00:25:56,393 --> 00:25:58,554
- The ping-pong lady...
- Oh!

497
00:25:58,596 --> 00:26:00,154
( faux-ltalian accent )
...said me too chubby.

498
00:26:00,197 --> 00:26:02,131
Me need
to lose weight.

499
00:26:02,166 --> 00:26:03,531
Too chubby, too chubby.

500
00:26:03,567 --> 00:26:06,035
If they can make those
ladyboys look fuckin' good...

501
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:08,504
then there might be hope
for me yet. You never know.

502
00:26:11,475 --> 00:26:12,635
- Hello.
- Hello.

503
00:26:12,676 --> 00:26:14,906
- I am Pancho.
- I'm Dr. Somsak.

504
00:26:14,945 --> 00:26:16,742
Mm-hmm.

505
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,179
Would you say
I have a beer belly?

506
00:26:18,215 --> 00:26:20,911
Yes, in compare to your height.

507
00:26:20,951 --> 00:26:23,078
Yeah, I'm a bit overweight, yeah.

508
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,178
Uh-huh, yeah.

509
00:26:24,221 --> 00:26:26,712
But it makes me
stronger to party.

510
00:26:26,757 --> 00:26:28,452
This is the real deal, isn't it?

511
00:26:28,492 --> 00:26:29,891
I don't think
he realizes how--

512
00:26:29,927 --> 00:26:31,758
I don't think he realizes
what he's let himself in for.

513
00:26:31,795 --> 00:26:34,593
How does it feel,
taking fat out?

514
00:26:34,632 --> 00:26:36,566
- Oh, some pain.
- ( yelling )

515
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,363
Some pain?

516
00:26:38,402 --> 00:26:41,200
- Some pain.
- ( both sucking )

517
00:26:41,238 --> 00:26:44,366
This is the fat that come out
in the bottle after liposuction.

518
00:26:44,408 --> 00:26:45,898
Ooh.

519
00:26:45,943 --> 00:26:47,672
This is blood,
and this is fat.

520
00:26:47,711 --> 00:26:50,145
This is like putting
pantyliners on your face.

521
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,511
( lisps )
New, with wings.

522
00:26:51,548 --> 00:26:54,108
I've got to be honest--
I am proper shittin' it.

523
00:26:54,151 --> 00:26:55,641
Time for your medication,
Mr. Locke.

524
00:26:55,686 --> 00:26:59,122
Done some stupid,
silly stuff in my time,

525
00:26:59,156 --> 00:27:01,147
but this takes
the biscuit.

526
00:27:02,893 --> 00:27:04,861
Oh my God, I'm not gonna
be able to see what's happening.

527
00:27:04,895 --> 00:27:06,260
( exhales )

528
00:27:06,297 --> 00:27:07,821
The operation's
about to begin.

529
00:27:07,865 --> 00:27:10,095
- See the size of that needle.
- Pancho: Oh shut up, man.

530
00:27:12,069 --> 00:27:15,561
- Pancho: I can't feel anything yet.
- Oh shit.

531
00:27:15,606 --> 00:27:18,439
Has he cut me open?

532
00:27:18,475 --> 00:27:20,306
Pritchard: No.

533
00:27:20,344 --> 00:27:22,471
Oh my God.
Fuckin' hell.

534
00:27:22,513 --> 00:27:24,674
Look at the size
of that rod.

535
00:27:26,383 --> 00:27:29,352
Ow! Jesus, man.

536
00:27:30,854 --> 00:27:33,687
( yelling )

537
00:27:33,724 --> 00:27:36,522
He gone right down
by my hipbone.

538
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,927
( yelling )

539
00:27:39,964 --> 00:27:45,425
No more!
Ah. Fuckin' hell, man.

540
00:27:45,469 --> 00:27:48,495
Ow!

541
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:52,407
Oh fuck!
I'm fuckin'- -

542
00:27:52,443 --> 00:27:54,502
Squeeze my hand, man.

543
00:27:54,545 --> 00:27:57,946
Panch, I can see the head.
I can see the head, keep pushing.

544
00:27:57,982 --> 00:28:00,780
- Boys, I can't go through much more.
- Squeeze my hand, man.

545
00:28:00,818 --> 00:28:02,285
I can't --
it fuckin' feels so bad.

546
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:03,616
He hasn't even
started yet.

547
00:28:03,654 --> 00:28:05,918
- ( yelling )
- Panch, squeeze my hand,

548
00:28:05,956 --> 00:28:08,254
squeeze my hand.
Ah! Fuckin' A.

549
00:28:08,292 --> 00:28:10,590
Fingers are diggin' in.

550
00:28:10,627 --> 00:28:12,857
It's all right, man.
It's all right, this is it.

551
00:28:12,896 --> 00:28:15,626
That's it.
You're done.

552
00:28:15,666 --> 00:28:17,463
( Dr. Somsak speaking )

553
00:28:18,702 --> 00:28:20,533
Oh, they've just started.

554
00:28:20,571 --> 00:28:22,163
"Not done, just start."

555
00:28:22,206 --> 00:28:24,868
- Joycey: Keep your hands up.
- Oh no no.

556
00:28:24,908 --> 00:28:29,140
They're about to start sucking
the fat out of Pancho's hips.

557
00:28:29,179 --> 00:28:31,647
- Ah!
- Savage, man.

558
00:28:31,682 --> 00:28:34,378
Oh whoa whoa whoa! Ow!

559
00:28:34,418 --> 00:28:35,817
Pancho said "Ow."

560
00:28:35,853 --> 00:28:37,684
( Dr. Somsak speaking )

561
00:28:38,756 --> 00:28:39,950
No.

562
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:43,221
- Eww!
- Gosh!

563
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:46,423
Ow ow ow ow ow!

564
00:28:46,463 --> 00:28:49,557
I told you "Ow" means "More,"
you fuckin' plonker.

565
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,262
Ah! Fuckin' hell, man!

566
00:28:52,302 --> 00:28:54,395
Shut up! Get out,
you fucking bell-end!

567
00:28:54,438 --> 00:28:58,306
Daint, I'm not finding
any amusement in this now, right?

568
00:28:58,342 --> 00:29:00,207
I'm really starting
to spook out.

569
00:29:00,244 --> 00:29:02,678
( screaming )

570
00:29:06,283 --> 00:29:07,807
( Dr. Somsak speaks )

571
00:29:07,851 --> 00:29:10,342
Ah. Yeah!

572
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:14,887
Done, Panch,
you're done.

573
00:29:14,925 --> 00:29:16,449
That is your fat.

574
00:29:16,493 --> 00:29:19,951
I will give you,
so you can take the fat home.

575
00:29:19,997 --> 00:29:22,192
Oh my God, look how
much is there.

576
00:29:22,232 --> 00:29:24,996
Oh! Oh my God.

577
00:29:25,035 --> 00:29:27,003
- You're gonna love this.
- Oh!

578
00:29:27,037 --> 00:29:28,595
Right, now we've got it.

579
00:29:28,639 --> 00:29:30,504
I think we've got to think
of some way to get rid of it.

580
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:46,187
We're in Bangkok,
Thailand,

581
00:29:46,223 --> 00:29:49,386
and it's time to play
"Guess the Ladyboy,"

582
00:29:49,426 --> 00:29:51,155
but the thing is
I know myself

583
00:29:51,195 --> 00:29:53,663
that all these girls
here are ladyboys.

584
00:29:53,697 --> 00:29:55,130
A man or lady?

585
00:29:55,165 --> 00:29:57,030
Um, guy.

586
00:30:00,938 --> 00:30:03,839
- Pritchard: Nice ass on there.
- ( techno music playing )

587
00:30:03,874 --> 00:30:05,466
Oh, fuck off,
that's a dude.

588
00:30:05,509 --> 00:30:07,374
- That is definitely a bloke.
- No, that's definitely not.

589
00:30:07,411 --> 00:30:10,574
He's a man, look. He's got
a fuckin' Desperate Dan chin.

590
00:30:12,883 --> 00:30:15,181
- Joycey: Oh, look at that, yeah.
- Pritchard: That's a woman.

591
00:30:15,219 --> 00:30:16,618
That's a fuckin' man.

592
00:30:16,653 --> 00:30:18,848
- Look at her hands.
- Look at his hands.

593
00:30:20,991 --> 00:30:25,018
- That's a man.
- Oh yeah!

594
00:30:27,564 --> 00:30:29,657
That's a dude.
Thank you very much.

595
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,361
- Thank you.
- Cheers, Roger.

596
00:30:31,401 --> 00:30:32,834
( music stops )

597
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,267
- Jim: We've got to do it!
- Jim!

598
00:30:38,308 --> 00:30:41,106
Jim! Are you
fuckin' listening?!

599
00:30:41,145 --> 00:30:42,806
I am not
kissing a man!

600
00:30:42,846 --> 00:30:45,679
Fuckin' end of story!
If it was a fuckin' woman

601
00:30:45,716 --> 00:30:47,980
and I thought it was
a fucking woman and it was a man,

602
00:30:48,018 --> 00:30:50,612
my tough shit.
I am not kissing a fucking man.

603
00:30:50,654 --> 00:30:52,178
- Joycey: Is one a girl?
- Dainton: There's not.

604
00:30:52,222 --> 00:30:53,883
Joycey: Tell him which one
it is then. Tell him then.

605
00:30:53,924 --> 00:30:55,892
- Tell him which one it is.
- ( Jim speaking )

606
00:30:55,926 --> 00:30:58,827
Dainton:
Jim, Jim, Jim...

607
00:30:58,862 --> 00:31:01,524
Is it a woman?

608
00:31:01,565 --> 00:31:03,465
All right, then, brilliant.
That's okay then.

609
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,990
Dainton:
She has to be a woman.

610
00:31:05,035 --> 00:31:06,627
There's no way someone
like that can look like a man.

611
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:07,864
Which one do you
think is a woman?

612
00:31:07,905 --> 00:31:09,497
The one with the stars
and stripes on.

613
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:11,735
- That's a woman?
- Yeah.

614
00:31:11,775 --> 00:31:13,436
All right then.

615
00:31:13,477 --> 00:31:15,707
- Oh, this is the one I choose.
- ( techno music playing )

616
00:31:15,746 --> 00:31:17,509
I hope it's
a fucking woman.

617
00:31:17,548 --> 00:31:19,880
# Kissing... #

618
00:31:19,917 --> 00:31:21,407
Joycey: What do you reckon?
What do you reckon, Math?

619
00:31:21,451 --> 00:31:25,945
- Kiss it, Math.
- All: Oh!

620
00:31:25,989 --> 00:31:28,321
- Go on then, Dave.
- She's supposed to be a woman.

621
00:31:28,358 --> 00:31:30,326
It ain't, is it?

622
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,021
Dainton: That's a man.
This is clearly a man.

623
00:31:32,062 --> 00:31:33,529
I can't even look.

624
00:31:33,564 --> 00:31:36,294
Oh!

625
00:31:36,333 --> 00:31:39,427
Pancho: Go for the kiss.
Go for the kiss.

626
00:31:39,469 --> 00:31:42,233
- All: Oh!
- He just tongued it.

627
00:31:43,507 --> 00:31:45,998
That's it, finished.
Nice one, mate. Cheers.

628
00:31:47,611 --> 00:31:50,910
No no!
I'm gonna be sick.

629
00:31:50,948 --> 00:31:53,109
( coughing )

630
00:31:55,118 --> 00:31:57,177
I can't --

631
00:31:58,589 --> 00:32:00,147
( vomiting )

632
00:32:01,758 --> 00:32:04,955
Please be a man. What am I saying?
Please be a woman.

633
00:32:04,995 --> 00:32:06,758
- "Be a man"?
- She does look pretty good though.

634
00:32:06,797 --> 00:32:08,389
It is a woman,
isn't it?

635
00:32:08,432 --> 00:32:10,764
It is a woman, isn't it?

636
00:32:10,801 --> 00:32:14,202
Pritchard: Oh, Dainton,
she's got wicked fuckin' knockers.

637
00:32:14,238 --> 00:32:17,002
Oh! And the tongue
went in!

638
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,671
I've got a bit
of a boner coming.

639
00:32:21,708 --> 00:32:26,938
- And he's got--
- ...in the valleys, Daint.

640
00:32:26,977 --> 00:32:29,605
- They don't take too lightly--
- Whoa whoa! Just in case!

641
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:31,478
Hello.

642
00:32:31,515 --> 00:32:34,814
Are you a man or are you
a woman? Let's have a look.

643
00:32:34,852 --> 00:32:38,583
- Oh-- oh yeah, there's a cock.
- It's a man! Oh my God!

644
00:32:38,622 --> 00:32:41,557
Oh Jesus! Fuck!

645
00:32:41,592 --> 00:32:44,060
All right, mate.
Yep, let's see what you got.

646
00:32:44,094 --> 00:32:46,790
What have you got?
Oh my God!

647
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:51,128
Reveal.

648
00:32:51,166 --> 00:32:53,862
- Oh, it's a cock.
- It's a cock.

649
00:32:53,902 --> 00:32:57,303
- Oh Jesus.
- Put it away, put it away!

650
00:32:59,304 --> 00:33:03,939
I know she might be an ugly girl,
but it's not a pretty boy.

651
00:33:04,075 --> 00:33:07,511
- Let's have a look at the crown jewels.
- There's a cock in there.

652
00:33:07,545 --> 00:33:11,345
I think there's a cock. No no--
what have we got, what have we got?

653
00:33:11,382 --> 00:33:12,542
- Cock!
- There's a cock!

654
00:33:12,583 --> 00:33:15,074
Oh! Fuck!
Get off me!

655
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:17,848
He got himself one of them!

656
00:33:17,888 --> 00:33:20,880
He even got a fuckin'
semi-hard-on and everything

657
00:33:20,924 --> 00:33:22,448
and he fucking
used his tongue,

658
00:33:22,492 --> 00:33:25,928
when everyone else just
kissed him on the lips.

659
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:28,590
I've got fuckin'- -
I've got a misses and kids at home.

660
00:33:28,632 --> 00:33:30,497
What the fuck are they gonna do
when they see that?

661
00:33:30,534 --> 00:33:32,468
The missus probably
won't kiss me-- oh fuck.

662
00:33:32,502 --> 00:33:35,198
I actually went backstage
when you were outside,

663
00:33:35,238 --> 00:33:37,001
and I knew that every
single one was a man.

664
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,907
- You're fuckin' dead!
- ( yells )

665
00:33:39,943 --> 00:33:41,410
- You fuckin' cunt!
- Fuckin'- -!

666
00:33:41,445 --> 00:33:43,743
You set me up with
a fuckin' woman-- man, you dick!

667
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:45,975
You got a boner
off a man. Payback.

668
00:33:46,016 --> 00:33:47,278
Oh, fuck off.

669
00:33:47,317 --> 00:33:49,251
"What have you been doing
in Thailand, Dainton?"

670
00:33:49,286 --> 00:33:51,618
"Oh, just been hanging out
with some ladyboys, you know,

671
00:33:51,655 --> 00:33:54,180
having lap dances.
Even got aroused."

672
00:33:55,692 --> 00:33:58,855
( siren wails )

673
00:33:58,895 --> 00:34:02,456
Okay, boys, this is called
a game of Bangkok Roulette.

674
00:34:02,499 --> 00:34:04,626
Ning is gonna come in,
go under there,

675
00:34:04,668 --> 00:34:06,636
do her business.
We've got to try and guess

676
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:08,103
who she's doing
the business on.

677
00:34:08,138 --> 00:34:09,503
But if you get it wrong,

678
00:34:09,539 --> 00:34:12,007
then you'll have to have
a bug and down a whiskey.

679
00:34:12,042 --> 00:34:15,170
- And those bugs are fuckin' rank.
- Oh shit.

680
00:34:15,212 --> 00:34:16,941
Oh, look at that one.
He's got a face.

681
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:19,778
Oh!

682
00:34:24,254 --> 00:34:25,744
Right then, boys,

683
00:34:25,789 --> 00:34:28,053
- this is my sexy assistant, Ning.
- Hello.

684
00:34:28,091 --> 00:34:29,752
She's the one who's going
to be pleasuring us tonight.

685
00:34:29,793 --> 00:34:31,727
Dainton: God, they don't
hang around, do they?

686
00:34:31,762 --> 00:34:33,730
Right then, boys,
down with the pants.

687
00:34:33,764 --> 00:34:35,322
Are you ready
to play Bangkok Roulette?

688
00:34:36,465 --> 00:34:38,092
I'm fucking
smiling already.

689
00:34:38,133 --> 00:34:41,364
All right then, after three.
Three, two, one.

690
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:44,862
( jingling )

691
00:34:52,214 --> 00:34:54,341
Fuckin' hell, there's some good
poker faces here, boys.

692
00:34:57,086 --> 00:34:59,554
Right, that's the 30 seconds up.

693
00:34:59,588 --> 00:35:01,783
Now we've got to guess.
We'll start with Dainton.

694
00:35:01,824 --> 00:35:04,019
Who do you think
was getting played with?

695
00:35:04,059 --> 00:35:07,051
Boys, I can't tell you
because I am being played with.

696
00:35:07,096 --> 00:35:09,724
I thought--
I thought it was you.

697
00:35:09,765 --> 00:35:10,733
It's me!

698
00:35:12,268 --> 00:35:14,565
Can you tell her to stop?
I might get a boner.

699
00:35:15,602 --> 00:35:17,570
"Say hello to
my little friend."

700
00:35:17,604 --> 00:35:19,094
Get it over
and done with. Come on.

701
00:35:19,139 --> 00:35:21,130
Come on, Pritch.
It's not a spider.

702
00:35:24,244 --> 00:35:26,712
I just-- sorry, boys,
that freaked me out then.

703
00:35:26,747 --> 00:35:28,374
- Why?
- A bit of his leg was in my mouth.

704
00:35:29,688 --> 00:35:30,863
Come on, stop stalling.

705
00:35:30,898 --> 00:35:33,150
- These boys are gonna get--
- Go on, chew it.

706
00:35:33,187 --> 00:35:35,155
I can't do it!
I don't like bugs!

707
00:35:35,189 --> 00:35:37,089
I don't like fuckin'- -

708
00:35:37,124 --> 00:35:39,251
I don't like ladyboys,
but you fuckin' tricked me.

709
00:35:39,293 --> 00:35:40,783
He's fuckin'
freaking me out.

710
00:35:40,828 --> 00:35:42,819
Payback, Pritch.
Payback.

711
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:54,059
- Don't be sick on Ning.
- Get the leg.

712
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:56,936
Own up, who was it?

713
00:35:57,143 --> 00:35:59,338
There we go. Look.

714
00:35:59,378 --> 00:36:02,108
- Come on!
- It's going in.

715
00:36:02,148 --> 00:36:03,945
Oh, don't be sick now.

716
00:36:03,983 --> 00:36:04,972
( vomiting )

717
00:36:05,017 --> 00:36:07,247
Oh, Jesus!

718
00:36:07,286 --> 00:36:08,913
- Oh!
- Ew!

719
00:36:08,955 --> 00:36:12,356
- Don't want to spill.
- All: Oh!

720
00:36:13,391 --> 00:36:16,258
- You.
- It was me and I got a raging boner.

721
00:36:16,294 --> 00:36:19,024
- Oh no no no no!
- ( gags )

722
00:36:19,064 --> 00:36:21,430
Quick quick quick.
Come on, Pancho!

723
00:36:21,466 --> 00:36:23,696
( laughing )

724
00:36:23,735 --> 00:36:25,498
Go on, get it down.

725
00:36:30,041 --> 00:36:31,975
You what?

726
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:33,637
Boys, the bugs
ain't even that bad.

727
00:36:33,678 --> 00:36:35,646
I could stay here drinking whiskey
and eating bugs all night.

728
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,477
It's like pork scratchings,
that's all it is.

729
00:36:37,515 --> 00:36:39,244
Well, let's fuckin'
up the ante, then.

730
00:36:39,284 --> 00:36:41,275
- Up the ante?
- Yeah, let's do it with something else.

731
00:36:41,319 --> 00:36:44,117
( screaming )

732
00:36:44,155 --> 00:36:45,952
I've got some
good stuff here, lads.

733
00:36:45,991 --> 00:36:48,824
- ( all groaning )
- It's my man-fat.

734
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:50,418
Jesus--!

735
00:36:50,462 --> 00:36:52,521
Probably about 90% proof.

736
00:36:52,564 --> 00:36:55,727
I've set up a little game show.
You remember "Family Fortune"?

737
00:36:55,767 --> 00:36:58,395
This is called
"Unfortunate Wank."

738
00:36:58,436 --> 00:37:01,030
We'll do the same thing--
whoever gets wanked off

739
00:37:01,072 --> 00:37:03,006
has to fuckin'
down the fat.

740
00:37:03,041 --> 00:37:04,599
What, whichever one
she picks?

741
00:37:04,643 --> 00:37:06,941
Yeah. So she's picking
who eats the fat.

742
00:37:06,978 --> 00:37:09,208
No way.

743
00:37:09,247 --> 00:37:11,215
Joycey: Whoever gets the wank
has to down the man-fat.

744
00:37:11,249 --> 00:37:15,982
Without further ado,
Ming, do your thing!

745
00:37:17,921 --> 00:37:19,252
Oh my God.

746
00:37:19,289 --> 00:37:21,484
( all scream )

747
00:37:22,124 --> 00:37:24,024
Sucker!

748
00:37:23,459 --> 00:37:25,859
That looks fucking rank.
Look at it.

749
00:37:25,895 --> 00:37:27,624
It's all like bits
of fuckin'- -

750
00:37:27,664 --> 00:37:29,461
That's not--
that's not food, man.

751
00:37:29,499 --> 00:37:31,467
That's proper fuckin'
Panch fat.

752
00:37:31,501 --> 00:37:32,968
Look, the doctor
showed me, right...

753
00:37:33,002 --> 00:37:34,993
This is blood,
and this is fat.

754
00:37:35,038 --> 00:37:38,235
It's fucked up.
You-- you're in there.

755
00:37:38,274 --> 00:37:41,072
- Dainton: Let's get on with it.
- This is fucking cannibalism,

756
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:43,635
for fuck's sake.
You get sent down for this shit.

757
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,740
Well, separate--
separate the blood from the fat.

758
00:37:46,783 --> 00:37:48,444
Pour it in,
pour it in, pour it in.

759
00:37:48,484 --> 00:37:50,714
This--
oh! Oh man!

760
00:37:50,753 --> 00:37:53,415
Pritchard:
Oh, that is fucking wrong, man.

761
00:37:53,456 --> 00:37:55,253
Pancho:
See, there's blood there.

762
00:37:55,291 --> 00:37:57,259
( gagging )

763
00:37:57,293 --> 00:38:00,956
Look-- don't -- there's a bucket there.
There's a bucket there.

764
00:38:02,899 --> 00:38:05,026
Oh my God,
there's a stringy bit!

765
00:38:05,068 --> 00:38:06,865
Look at it,
just dangling!

766
00:38:06,903 --> 00:38:08,268
Pancho:
Oh man!

767
00:38:08,304 --> 00:38:10,636
Oh!

768
00:38:10,673 --> 00:38:13,540
Dainton: No shit.
This is without a doubt

769
00:38:13,576 --> 00:38:18,104
the sickest, fucked-up stunt
we've ever-- we've ever done.

770
00:38:18,147 --> 00:38:20,615
If you're in the cinema now
watching this,

771
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:24,609
pull your sick bag out,
because this is gonna be fucking needed.

772
00:38:24,654 --> 00:38:28,090
Steak-- lovely,
very very rare steak.

773
00:38:28,124 --> 00:38:29,853
It's a very rare steak.

774
00:38:31,961 --> 00:38:33,826
All: Oh!

775
00:38:34,931 --> 00:38:37,161
Oh! Fuck!

776
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,259
Oh my God.

777
00:38:43,172 --> 00:38:44,400
Oh God!

778
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,930
All right, I'm gonna
fucking do this again

779
00:38:45,975 --> 00:38:47,636
and I'm gonna
keep it down this time.

780
00:38:47,677 --> 00:38:49,110
I don't want to be
a part of this anymore.

781
00:38:49,145 --> 00:38:50,976
- This has gone too far.
- It's just smooth water.

782
00:38:51,014 --> 00:38:52,447
It's just smooth water.

783
00:38:52,482 --> 00:38:55,042
Relax, calm
calm calm.

784
00:38:55,084 --> 00:38:56,847
Relax, swallow.

785
00:39:03,626 --> 00:39:05,184
Dainton:
Gulp, gulp it.

786
00:39:05,228 --> 00:39:06,490
Gulp.

787
00:39:10,566 --> 00:39:12,261
Go on--
it's tomato juice.

788
00:39:18,708 --> 00:39:20,539
- Yeah!
- I've just eaten a fuckin' man,

789
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:22,271
for fuck's sake!

790
00:39:22,312 --> 00:39:25,213
- ( groans )
- If you haven't gone

791
00:39:25,248 --> 00:39:27,375
for your doggy bag yet...

792
00:39:27,417 --> 00:39:30,113
you're as equally fucked
as these bastards.

793
00:39:33,056 --> 00:39:36,924
Welcome to "Dirty Sanchez."
I've just eaten a man.

794
00:40:08,391 --> 00:40:10,484
Here we are!
Phi Phi!

795
00:40:10,526 --> 00:40:14,553
We've just done lust,
now it's time for envy.

796
00:40:14,597 --> 00:40:17,623
Ooh, don't.
That was nice.

797
00:40:28,144 --> 00:40:30,942
All right, boys, you just
arrived in Phi Phi.

798
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:32,470
Nice, isn't it?

799
00:40:32,515 --> 00:40:34,005
- Lovely, Dainton.
- It is.

800
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:36,041
There's a price to pay
for everything, though, isn't there?

801
00:40:36,085 --> 00:40:38,280
Exactly, because
this is the deal, yeah?

802
00:40:38,321 --> 00:40:41,313
- We're gonna have a little crab race.
- I don't like crabs!

803
00:40:41,357 --> 00:40:43,325
Two crabs that are winners,

804
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:45,350
those guys get to stay in
the beautiful accommodation...

805
00:40:45,395 --> 00:40:48,558
( speaks Thai )
Welcome to Zeavola.

806
00:40:48,598 --> 00:40:50,395
This is
a five-stars property.

807
00:40:50,433 --> 00:40:54,130
For those who stay here,
they can relax, enjoy and being lazy.

808
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:56,900
...and the guys with
the slowest crabs,

809
00:40:56,939 --> 00:40:59,908
gotta go in-- the accommodation
is a rat-infested shithole

810
00:40:59,942 --> 00:41:01,671
on the other side
of the island.

811
00:41:03,946 --> 00:41:06,608
Luckily, Daint, I think
I picked up crabs in fucking Bangkok,

812
00:41:06,649 --> 00:41:08,640
- and these are fast fuckers.
- Go on, Number Two.

813
00:41:08,684 --> 00:41:11,050
- Come on, Number Four.
- Give me. Give me rock.

814
00:41:11,087 --> 00:41:12,748
Come on, crab.
Come on!

815
00:41:12,789 --> 00:41:14,780
Yes!
Mine's out first!

816
00:41:14,824 --> 00:41:16,883
- Come on. Come on, boy.
- ( cheering )

817
00:41:19,695 --> 00:41:22,755
I bloody spurred yours.
I made yours win!

818
00:41:22,799 --> 00:41:25,359
I was given a fucking crab
that wasn't even alive,

819
00:41:25,401 --> 00:41:29,030
that was never going anywhere. I was
always sleeping in the tin fucking-hut.

820
00:41:29,072 --> 00:41:31,472
I'm gonna make you sick with envy
when you see my place. Come on.

821
00:41:31,507 --> 00:41:33,975
Do you want to come
and have a look at my little pad?

822
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:35,841
I'd rather wank
my old man off, Panch.

823
00:41:35,878 --> 00:41:38,244
Welcome to Zeavola.

824
00:41:42,952 --> 00:41:44,852
Oh, boys, I do see
our swimming pool.

825
00:41:44,887 --> 00:41:46,752
- Joycey: Oh, fuck off!
- Pritchard: Oh my God!

826
00:41:46,789 --> 00:41:48,313
( laughs )

827
00:41:52,762 --> 00:41:55,856
Well, it looks like
fucking shantytown to me already.

828
00:41:58,334 --> 00:42:00,666
- ( groans )
- Oh, look at that.

829
00:42:00,703 --> 00:42:02,728
Shoes off, Joyce.
Just look at this place.

830
00:42:02,772 --> 00:42:05,798
Fit for a king.
Fit for a king!

831
00:42:08,778 --> 00:42:11,338
( all laugh )

832
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:14,076
- Oh my God.
- Oh, dude.

833
00:42:14,117 --> 00:42:16,312
Look at what I'll see
in the morning when I wake up.

834
00:42:16,352 --> 00:42:17,649
Joycey:
This takes the piss.

835
00:42:17,687 --> 00:42:20,713
There's cockroaches
on the bed!

836
00:42:20,756 --> 00:42:23,088
- Where? Let's have a look.
- I can't sleep in here.

837
00:42:23,126 --> 00:42:26,289
I told you. At least there's
a bit of porn on the wall.

838
00:42:26,329 --> 00:42:28,559
Ooh, look. We've got
lights in here.

839
00:42:28,598 --> 00:42:30,156
I thought they
were fairy lights.

840
00:42:30,199 --> 00:42:32,224
They're just holes
in the ceiling. ( laughs )

841
00:42:32,268 --> 00:42:35,294
I tell you what-- I think there's
a few fucking rats in the ground here.

842
00:42:35,338 --> 00:42:37,238
- Oh what?
- You said rat-infested.

843
00:42:37,273 --> 00:42:39,241
There's a fucking
red ants' nest up in the tree

844
00:42:39,275 --> 00:42:41,800
- in that pair of old stinking pants.
- Joycey: There is as well.

845
00:42:41,844 --> 00:42:44,335
I ain't fucking staying here.
I can tell you that now.

846
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:46,041
You've got to.
It's "Sanchez Rule."

847
00:42:46,082 --> 00:42:47,811
"Sanchez Rule" has
always been the same:

848
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:49,784
You lose, you fucking
stick the consequence.

849
00:42:49,819 --> 00:42:52,447
But Daint, there's
fucking bugs everywhere.

850
00:42:52,488 --> 00:42:55,218
- I'm fucking not--
- Whoa, man!

851
00:42:55,258 --> 00:42:57,249
- Fuck, look at the size--
- See what I mean?

852
00:42:57,293 --> 00:42:59,056
We can't fucking sleep here.

853
00:42:59,095 --> 00:43:01,029
He's carrying half a tree.
You've got to stay here.

854
00:43:01,063 --> 00:43:03,190
You lost fair and square,
we won fair and square.

855
00:43:03,232 --> 00:43:04,824
Yeah, but you're in
a seven-star fucking hotel.

856
00:43:04,867 --> 00:43:06,232
Welcome to Zeavola.

857
00:43:06,269 --> 00:43:08,533
If I'm staying in here,
I'm gonna make sure

858
00:43:08,571 --> 00:43:10,539
you go back to that hotel
fucking pissed off.

859
00:43:10,573 --> 00:43:12,939
Like how?
I'm going back to the hotel--

860
00:43:12,975 --> 00:43:14,743
- Do you want to fucking see?
- I'm going back to the hotel

861
00:43:14,744 --> 00:43:17,679
with the biggest grin on my face knowing
that you're stuck in this proper--

862
00:43:17,714 --> 00:43:19,079
this is worse
than I described.

863
00:43:19,115 --> 00:43:22,346
Yeah, but when you
go back to the hotel...

864
00:43:22,385 --> 00:43:25,616
you're going to be
proper pissed off when you see this.

865
00:43:25,655 --> 00:43:27,350
"I love Dainton."

866
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:31,215
- Dainton, are you not envious of that?
- You're fucking sick!

867
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:34,876
- Aren't you envious of that?
- "I heart Dainton."

868
00:43:37,611 --> 00:43:39,032
Are you sure you don't want
to share your seven-star room

869
00:43:39,066 --> 00:43:40,966
- with me now, love?
- Who's envious now, eh?

870
00:43:42,101 --> 00:43:44,160
- Is that fucking real?
- Yeah.

871
00:43:44,203 --> 00:43:45,966
Try and rub it off,
Dainton.

872
00:43:51,205 --> 00:43:52,467
( needle buzzes )

873
00:43:52,956 --> 00:43:56,153
Pritch, you can't have fucking
"I love Dainton" on your cock!

874
00:43:56,193 --> 00:43:57,820
You don't fucking
love me, you hate me.

875
00:43:57,861 --> 00:44:00,421
By the end of this I'm going
to make sure you really hate me.

876
00:44:00,464 --> 00:44:02,193
You're going to want
to chop your own cock off.

877
00:44:02,232 --> 00:44:04,063
I tell you-- I'm going
to fucking knock you out.

878
00:44:04,178 --> 00:44:06,020
"I love Dainton"

879
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:08,983
What in God's name have I dont to you?

880
00:44:09,083 --> 00:44:11,770
Oh, fucking hell!
It's never-fucking-ending!

881
00:44:11,771 --> 00:44:13,329
( paintball gun firing )

882
00:44:15,241 --> 00:44:17,971
There's no record
for the most paintballs to the body.

883
00:44:19,278 --> 00:44:22,213
- Oh fucking God!
- ( guys laughing )

884
00:44:22,248 --> 00:44:24,876
That fucking Anthony Kelly,
he's a right thick cunt.

885
00:44:24,917 --> 00:44:27,977
- ( guys laughing )
- You fucking wanker!

886
00:44:29,021 --> 00:44:30,818
Yes!

887
00:44:30,857 --> 00:44:32,791
- Yes!
- The whole letter, it was fake.

888
00:44:32,825 --> 00:44:35,919
103 fucking bullets to my fucking body
and there's no such thing?

889
00:44:35,962 --> 00:44:37,930
I'm in that
fucking great book, baby!

890
00:44:37,964 --> 00:44:39,625
Whoo! Yeah!

891
00:44:39,665 --> 00:44:42,691
I've got 103 bullet holes
in my fucking body

892
00:44:42,735 --> 00:44:44,726
for fucking
no reason at all!

893
00:44:44,770 --> 00:44:46,635
( shrieks, laughs )

894
00:44:46,672 --> 00:44:49,038
I'm sorry,
this is fucking amazing!

895
00:44:49,075 --> 00:44:50,975
This is the funniest thing
I've ever seen.

896
00:44:51,010 --> 00:44:54,036
103 fucking bullet holes--
what else are you gonna do to me?

897
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:55,809
- Knock you out!
- You're gonna catch malaria

898
00:44:55,848 --> 00:44:58,646
- staying in this shithole tonight.
- I'll tell you what--

899
00:44:58,684 --> 00:45:01,778
that's fucking it now.
You've pissed me off so fucking much,

900
00:45:01,821 --> 00:45:03,379
- let's have a fight.
- You wanna fight?

901
00:45:03,422 --> 00:45:05,413
Yeah, I'll fight you,
Thai boxing,

902
00:45:05,458 --> 00:45:07,926
in the boxing ring.
Fucking yeah. Tomorrow.

903
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:10,258
Right. No shit.
I'll take you up on that.

904
00:45:10,296 --> 00:45:12,230
This might be the last time
we fucking shake hands.

905
00:45:12,265 --> 00:45:14,062
Don't take it to heart
if I knock you out

906
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:15,795
and I won't take it to heart
if you knock me out,

907
00:45:15,835 --> 00:45:18,360
but I'm gonna come out
tomorrow night fucking swinging.

908
00:45:18,404 --> 00:45:21,840
You had better be, because I'll be
swinging like a fucking windmill.

909
00:45:23,376 --> 00:45:25,344
( siren blaring )

910
00:45:25,378 --> 00:45:27,346
Pritchard:
I am fucking starving.

911
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:30,679
- I haven't eaten all fucking day.
- I'll eat anything.

912
00:45:30,716 --> 00:45:32,911
They put us--
Pancho and Dainton

913
00:45:32,952 --> 00:45:35,546
are sitting there,
champagne fucking dinner...

914
00:45:35,588 --> 00:45:39,080
- Champagne, Panch?
- It's like cracking open an egg.

915
00:45:39,125 --> 00:45:40,558
Crack on.

916
00:45:40,593 --> 00:45:43,426
Joycey:
This place is a fucking shithole.

917
00:45:43,462 --> 00:45:45,896
Take me
the fuck out of here!

918
00:45:45,932 --> 00:45:47,900
Phi Phi, fuck me,

919
00:45:47,934 --> 00:45:50,596
this place is
a fucking wankville!

920
00:45:50,636 --> 00:45:53,969
Here's to happy days...
in Phi Phi.

921
00:45:55,675 --> 00:45:59,611
- At least you shit--
- Ah! Look at that fucking spider!

922
00:45:59,645 --> 00:46:01,704
- Stay there, stay there, stay there!
- No no no no, don't! Don't!

923
00:46:01,747 --> 00:46:03,374
- Joycey: Stay there!
- There's a fucking--

924
00:46:03,416 --> 00:46:05,611
Uh, grilled lobster.

925
00:46:06,686 --> 00:46:08,244
Caught today, please.

926
00:46:10,389 --> 00:46:12,220
- Joycey: Oh my God.
- ( groans )

927
00:46:12,258 --> 00:46:16,888
Can I have my food sprinkled
with the magic of Thailand, please?

928
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:19,691
What's that,
chili sauce?

929
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:22,065
( Joycey mumbles )

930
00:46:22,101 --> 00:46:24,399
Ah. Ah.
You fucking--

931
00:46:24,437 --> 00:46:26,302
Ah! Crap!

932
00:46:26,339 --> 00:46:28,330
( retches )

933
00:46:28,374 --> 00:46:32,708
- Bonjour, monsieur. Enjoy the view.
- Tres bien.

934
00:46:32,745 --> 00:46:34,838
- Spider. ( laughs )
- Ah!

935
00:46:35,881 --> 00:46:37,974
Where?! Fuck off.

936
00:46:38,017 --> 00:46:40,645
Where the-- hurry up, turn the light on!
Turn the light on!

937
00:46:40,686 --> 00:46:42,449
- ( Pritchard yelps )
- Joycey: Fuck off!

938
00:46:42,488 --> 00:46:44,456
- Watch! Watch!
- Pritchard: Fucking what's that?

939
00:46:44,490 --> 00:46:47,084
Joycey:
Say it! Say it!

940
00:46:47,126 --> 00:46:50,459
Oi, fucking get your arse--
oi, Pritch, it's fight day.

941
00:46:50,496 --> 00:46:53,021
Come on, man.
You're the winner.

942
00:46:55,134 --> 00:46:58,626
- ( thuds )
- He just whacked his head on that.

943
00:46:58,671 --> 00:47:00,229
( laughs )

944
00:47:00,272 --> 00:47:02,502
Shit. That's a good start
to a fucking training day.

945
00:47:04,877 --> 00:47:08,244
497, 498,

946
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,840
499, 500!

947
00:47:10,883 --> 00:47:12,976
You're fucking dead,
Pritchard!

948
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:15,578
Aww, look at
the little chicks.

949
00:47:15,621 --> 00:47:18,112
( chicken clucks )

950
00:47:18,157 --> 00:47:21,217
10 more!
Come on!

951
00:47:22,728 --> 00:47:24,195
( grunts )

952
00:47:46,185 --> 00:47:48,881
- Go on! Use him as a body bag!
- Ah!

953
00:47:48,921 --> 00:47:51,617
I'm gonna get him.
I'm gonna get him.

954
00:47:51,657 --> 00:47:55,093
- Say "I'm a tiger."
- I'm knackered.

955
00:47:57,797 --> 00:48:00,061
This fucking fight
ain't gonna last two minutes.

956
00:48:00,766 --> 00:48:02,961
( crowd yelling )

957
00:48:03,002 --> 00:48:05,994
This is the deal. Pritchard versus
Dainton, battle of the dickheads.

958
00:48:06,038 --> 00:48:07,596
- Do you wanna see my killer moves?
- Joycey: Yeah.

959
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:09,699
This time he's taken it
one step too far.

960
00:48:09,742 --> 00:48:13,234
Whoo! Whoo! Bam!

961
00:48:13,279 --> 00:48:15,440
I am going to fucking
unleash the beast.

962
00:48:15,481 --> 00:48:17,847
Might get my cock out.
He'll be like "Oh, what you doing?"

963
00:48:17,883 --> 00:48:20,477
- Boff.
- I'm not gonna fucking play with him.

964
00:48:20,519 --> 00:48:21,918
I'm not gonna
be nice to him.

965
00:48:24,457 --> 00:48:26,823
- ( bottle clatters )
- Oh! Oh.

966
00:48:26,859 --> 00:48:28,258
It was a spider
or a rat.

967
00:48:28,294 --> 00:48:29,784
There's no kissing,
there's no hugging

968
00:48:29,829 --> 00:48:31,228
and there's no fucking
tickling tonight.

969
00:48:31,263 --> 00:48:32,855
Oh, tickle-tickle.

970
00:48:32,898 --> 00:48:34,866
The Finisher.

971
00:48:35,868 --> 00:48:37,802
Dainton's gonna
kick his ass!

972
00:48:40,372 --> 00:48:44,399
Ladies and gentlemen!

973
00:48:44,443 --> 00:48:47,879
- Pritchard! Dainton!
- ( cheering )

974
00:48:50,216 --> 00:48:52,377
( Crowd chanting )
Go go go go go go...

975
00:48:54,186 --> 00:48:56,177
( crowd whistling )

976
00:49:08,934 --> 00:49:11,095
Fucking get over there!
One more!

977
00:49:12,638 --> 00:49:14,697
- ( bell dings )
- Whoo!

978
00:49:20,146 --> 00:49:22,614
Yeah, man!

979
00:49:22,648 --> 00:49:26,209
That's so hard, man.
It's not as easy as it looks.

980
00:49:26,252 --> 00:49:29,119
I hit him with the first,
the first of the match.

981
00:49:29,155 --> 00:49:32,249
He went down.
I thought he weren't gonna get back up.

982
00:49:32,291 --> 00:49:33,952
But he ain't got the prize.

983
00:49:33,993 --> 00:49:35,722
He stayed down--
fucked, gone, game over.

984
00:49:35,761 --> 00:49:39,026
I'll regain my pride
through stupidity, I think.

985
00:49:39,064 --> 00:49:42,033
Well, Pritchard,
we're off to Japan next,

986
00:49:42,067 --> 00:49:45,161
a country that is
fucking driven by pride.

987
00:49:45,204 --> 00:49:48,105
( all yell )
Let's get fucking bollixed!

988
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:51,075
Let's get
fucking bollixed!

989
00:49:51,877 --> 00:49:53,037
( rock music playing )

990
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:03,047
Huh! Tokyo.

991
00:50:07,092 --> 00:50:09,060
- You movie star!
- ( speaks Japanese )

992
00:50:32,751 --> 00:50:35,720
This challenge is called
the Spunky Dunky Challenge.

993
00:50:35,754 --> 00:50:38,018
We're all gonna go
to the toilets with a camera--

994
00:50:38,057 --> 00:50:39,524
just to make sure
that no one's cheating--

995
00:50:39,558 --> 00:50:41,048
and we're gonna spunk
in a dunky,

996
00:50:41,093 --> 00:50:43,084
and the one with
the least amount of spunk...

997
00:50:43,128 --> 00:50:44,823
has gotta wear
the spunky dunky.

998
00:50:44,864 --> 00:50:46,832
( jazz music playing )

999
00:50:46,866 --> 00:50:50,393
Fuck, here I am.
Made it to the toilet.

1000
00:50:51,737 --> 00:50:55,264
Now I've gotta have
a fucking wank.

1001
00:50:55,307 --> 00:50:57,172
I had a room
on my own last night

1002
00:50:57,209 --> 00:50:58,938
for the first time
in fucking three weeks,

1003
00:50:58,978 --> 00:51:02,709
and l-- and a fucking
powerful bidet jet that goes up my ass.

1004
00:51:02,748 --> 00:51:05,359
I took full advantage of it
and I had five wanks.

1005
00:51:05,527 --> 00:51:07,083
So I'm sure there's nothing even left.

1006
00:51:07,084 --> 00:51:09,644
You ain't seeing
my fucking come-face either.

1007
00:51:14,588 --> 00:51:17,056
Is he gonna come out
with a load in the condom?

1008
00:51:17,091 --> 00:51:18,922
Is he gonna come out
with a poor show?

1009
00:51:18,959 --> 00:51:21,655
If he comes out with a load--

1010
00:51:21,695 --> 00:51:23,822
I don't wanna say this, but we're
gonna have to check the footage.

1011
00:51:25,364 --> 00:51:27,229
How much you got?
- Any good?

1012
00:51:27,266 --> 00:51:28,756
( Joycey laughs )

1013
00:51:28,801 --> 00:51:31,964
( jazz music plays )

1014
00:51:32,004 --> 00:51:34,996
Oh, there's some romantic music
in there while he's doing it.

1015
00:51:38,244 --> 00:51:39,734
Where's Dainton's glass?

1016
00:51:39,779 --> 00:51:41,838
Which one's
Dainton's glass?

1017
00:51:41,881 --> 00:51:44,748
Oh, this is wrong, man.
This is Dainton having a wank.

1018
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:50,520
- Why is he saying "Pritch"?
- Shut up.

1019
00:51:50,556 --> 00:51:52,615
Fuck! Can't even get
a fucking hard-on!

1020
00:51:52,658 --> 00:51:54,683
Did you keep thinking
about us at any point?

1021
00:51:54,727 --> 00:51:57,195
I thought about Dainton
quite a bit, yeah.

1022
00:52:00,166 --> 00:52:02,031
Pritchard:
Oh, that's less than me!

1023
00:52:02,067 --> 00:52:03,830
Yes! I'm not getting it!

1024
00:52:04,294 --> 00:52:06,203
There he is boys.

1025
00:52:06,869 --> 00:52:09,235
Oh, fucking hell!

1026
00:52:10,107 --> 00:52:11,226
Damn, how can he do that?

1027
00:52:13,908 --> 00:52:17,275
The music was one of the big factors
in me having a hard time wanking.

1028
00:52:18,946 --> 00:52:21,414
This music is
really putting me off.

1029
00:52:21,449 --> 00:52:23,349
Panch has been
so long in the toilet with the camera

1030
00:52:23,384 --> 00:52:26,046
having a wank that Dan
has to go down with my camera.

1031
00:52:27,137 --> 00:52:28,816
Gays take these
into bog toilets,

1032
00:52:28,856 --> 00:52:30,881
right, so that when--

1033
00:52:30,925 --> 00:52:32,756
when he meets
another cottager,

1034
00:52:32,793 --> 00:52:35,785
he puts his feet into it
whilst the other one blows him off,

1035
00:52:35,830 --> 00:52:37,354
so when the attendant
looks under

1036
00:52:37,398 --> 00:52:39,923
he sees a bag
and one set of feet.

1037
00:52:39,967 --> 00:52:42,367
Daint--
Daint taught me that.

1038
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:47,971
You've been dipping
your condom in there, haven't you?

1039
00:52:48,008 --> 00:52:49,942
You dipped it
in there, didn't you?

1040
00:52:49,977 --> 00:52:51,968
Because you knew
I'd go for that instead.

1041
00:52:56,183 --> 00:52:57,980
Yeah, I have been.

1042
00:53:01,222 --> 00:53:03,452
- Fucking twat!
- Don't --

1043
00:53:05,001 --> 00:53:06,164
There she is.

1044
00:53:06,491 --> 00:53:09,289
- Did you fucking do that?
- You should've drunk out of your glass.

1045
00:53:09,327 --> 00:53:10,988
- Did you do that?
- I put some cum in there.

1046
00:53:15,028 --> 00:53:16,996
Boys, that was
hard fucking work.

1047
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:18,964
- You're sweating!
- He's sweating!

1048
00:53:18,999 --> 00:53:22,059
That was so fuck--
so much hard work.

1049
00:53:23,502 --> 00:53:25,094
Panch, if I was you,
I'd drink out of that,

1050
00:53:25,137 --> 00:53:26,866
because he put
a fucking jimmy in my pint.

1051
00:53:26,906 --> 00:53:29,466
That was-- that was a proper
under-pressure wank.

1052
00:53:37,008 --> 00:53:38,976
Look.

1053
00:53:39,010 --> 00:53:40,910
- Well, you drink out of that then.
- Pour some in there.

1054
00:53:40,945 --> 00:53:43,140
L-- I've just
fucking drunk two pints.

1055
00:53:43,181 --> 00:53:44,808
I don't trust
any fucker on this team.

1056
00:53:44,849 --> 00:53:46,111
I ain't drinking
out of it.

1057
00:53:46,151 --> 00:53:48,142
Oh, for fuck's sake.
Jesus Christ.

1058
00:53:48,186 --> 00:53:50,154
- Yeah, it's your cock, it don't matter.
- No, l--

1059
00:53:50,188 --> 00:53:52,315
It ain't my fucking cock.
Just fucking drink it.

1060
00:53:52,357 --> 00:53:54,052
I've fucked
with people's glasses.

1061
00:53:54,092 --> 00:53:57,289
We've just had this argument.
There's fuck all wrong with it.

1062
00:53:57,328 --> 00:53:59,125
- ( gags )
- ( laughs )

1063
00:54:01,864 --> 00:54:03,855
You've tampered
with that.

1064
00:54:03,899 --> 00:54:05,696
I haven't tampered with it.

1065
00:54:05,734 --> 00:54:08,066
I'm just good
at fucking pulling my plonker.

1066
00:54:08,103 --> 00:54:10,697
That's a fucking
endurance test.

1067
00:54:10,739 --> 00:54:13,037
How fucking hard is that?

1068
00:54:13,075 --> 00:54:16,101
We've all been to the toilet,
we've done the fucking deed.

1069
00:54:16,145 --> 00:54:19,171
As embarrassing as it was,
it's fucking crunch time.

1070
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:21,478
All:
Two, one.

1071
00:54:21,517 --> 00:54:24,577
- Joycey!
- Yeah!

1072
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:25,848
Oh, yes!

1073
00:54:25,888 --> 00:54:28,880
- It's going all in his hair.
- ( yells )

1074
00:54:28,924 --> 00:54:31,415
Jim:
Oh, that looks good.

1075
00:54:31,460 --> 00:54:33,792
That's it, slow. Slower.

1076
00:54:33,829 --> 00:54:36,389
Blow it up!
Blow it up!

1077
00:54:36,431 --> 00:54:38,695
Blow it up,
Dan, blow it up.

1078
00:54:38,734 --> 00:54:41,828
- Blow it till it pops!
- ( pops )

1079
00:54:43,772 --> 00:54:45,603
I may be the winner,
but I'm the--

1080
00:54:45,641 --> 00:54:47,973
I'm the loser,
aren't I?

1081
00:54:48,577 --> 00:54:50,738
( rock music playing )

1082
00:55:01,788 --> 00:55:03,119
We're in Japan.

1083
00:55:03,156 --> 00:55:04,851
We're about to meet
the Tokyo Shock Boys.

1084
00:55:04,891 --> 00:55:07,416
( yells )

1085
00:55:10,563 --> 00:55:12,554
Their stunts
and our stunts.

1086
00:55:12,599 --> 00:55:14,533
( all yelling )

1087
00:55:19,372 --> 00:55:22,808
- Welcome to Japan.
- Bummer, man.

1088
00:55:22,842 --> 00:55:24,002
( speaks Japanese )

1089
00:55:24,043 --> 00:55:25,408
- Hello.
- Hello.

1090
00:55:25,445 --> 00:55:26,935
We're in Japan,
it's your country.

1091
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:29,380
Let's fucking see how
the Tokyo Shock Boys rock.

1092
00:55:29,415 --> 00:55:31,246
Okay, okay.

1093
00:55:31,284 --> 00:55:32,808
Here we go.

1094
00:55:32,852 --> 00:55:35,582
- This is beer.
- Okay.

1095
00:55:35,622 --> 00:55:38,250
Come on, come on,
come on. Okay.

1096
00:55:38,291 --> 00:55:42,660
Oh my God!
How the fuck do you do that!

1097
00:55:42,695 --> 00:55:44,754
Cheers.

1098
00:55:46,532 --> 00:55:48,056
Cigarette.

1099
00:56:00,747 --> 00:56:03,648
Well, I honestly haven't a fucking clue
what he's doing this time.

1100
00:56:05,418 --> 00:56:08,285
( yells )

1101
00:56:08,321 --> 00:56:12,485
Fucking hell!
Fucking hell!

1102
00:56:49,233 --> 00:56:52,327
I can give you...
good thing.

1103
00:56:52,370 --> 00:56:55,168
Oh, it better not
be your cock.

1104
00:57:08,186 --> 00:57:09,813
Next, you!

1105
00:57:13,858 --> 00:57:15,655
It's time to shock
the Shock Boys!

1106
00:57:17,795 --> 00:57:20,355
We've invented a new game.
This is called "Bum Drum."

1107
00:57:20,398 --> 00:57:22,866
- New game.
- Yeah, what we do is he sticks

1108
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:26,427
one up his bum, I stick one
up mine and we drum sticks,

1109
00:57:26,470 --> 00:57:29,564
and the first one
to fall out gets a Dirty Sanchez.

1110
00:57:30,675 --> 00:57:32,700
Every man knows--
on a blind date,

1111
00:57:32,743 --> 00:57:35,871
you always use
the best lube there is-- a bit of spit.

1112
00:57:35,913 --> 00:57:37,710
Go!

1113
00:57:37,748 --> 00:57:40,148
It's a good fight!

1114
00:57:41,619 --> 00:57:42,643
Shit!

1115
00:57:50,223 --> 00:57:51,554
It's all right.
It's not that bad.

1116
00:57:51,591 --> 00:57:53,058
Don't know what
you're whingeing about.

1117
00:57:53,092 --> 00:57:55,219
Stop!

1118
00:57:56,229 --> 00:57:58,094
Smell bad!

1119
00:57:58,131 --> 00:58:00,998
The Japanese like their tea,
so I'm gonna brew them some up.

1120
00:58:02,001 --> 00:58:04,435
( speaks Japanese )

1121
00:58:06,305 --> 00:58:08,330
( guys yelling )

1122
00:58:17,942 --> 00:58:19,910
- Give it a swing now.
- Swing it.

1123
00:58:19,944 --> 00:58:22,037
I think
the kettle's boiled!

1124
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:26,209
Daint! Dainton!

1125
00:58:26,251 --> 00:58:28,048
Dainton!
Fuck off, Dainton!

1126
00:58:30,054 --> 00:58:31,681
Right, now they're in
for a finale.

1127
00:58:31,722 --> 00:58:33,189
This stuff is
about to go down the pan.

1128
00:58:33,224 --> 00:58:35,055
Let the beer enema begin!

1129
00:58:39,397 --> 00:58:40,864
- Right, you ready?
- Ready.

1130
00:58:47,733 --> 00:58:50,759
Stop it! No more!
Don't do it.

1131
00:58:50,803 --> 00:58:52,964
- Stop it!
- Go on, Dan.

1132
00:58:53,005 --> 00:58:54,666
Right, boys.

1133
00:59:00,579 --> 00:59:02,444
Have you got
any more squirt in there?

1134
00:59:02,481 --> 00:59:05,348
No no no no! Ah!

1135
00:59:16,593 --> 00:59:18,458
You must come back
to Britain with us

1136
00:59:18,495 --> 00:59:21,726
and we'll do a show together
and party together.

1137
00:59:21,764 --> 00:59:23,698
No way!

1138
00:59:35,612 --> 00:59:37,341
Ta-ta, Daint.

1139
00:59:38,982 --> 00:59:41,109
- These Japanese wrestlers--
- They're hard as fuck.

1140
00:59:41,150 --> 00:59:43,141
- We're gonna take them out?
- What do Japanese wrestlers do?

1141
00:59:51,494 --> 00:59:53,359
Extreme
Japanese wrestlers.

1142
00:59:56,566 --> 00:59:58,500
Fight with glass
and barbed wire.

1143
00:59:59,602 --> 01:00:01,331
I know there's
one stunt they do

1144
01:00:01,371 --> 01:00:04,169
where they shove glass
into their fucking forehead like that.

1145
01:00:05,308 --> 01:00:06,707
No! No!

1146
01:00:06,743 --> 01:00:09,177
And I can tell you
which ones have had it done.

1147
01:00:09,212 --> 01:00:11,544
He's had it done,
he's had it done

1148
01:00:11,581 --> 01:00:13,572
- and he's had it done.
- We're out here laughing--

1149
01:00:13,616 --> 01:00:15,743
like laughing and shit--
and when we walk through the door,

1150
01:00:15,785 --> 01:00:17,275
they're gonna be
in there just going...

1151
01:00:20,189 --> 01:00:23,056
He looks quite mild, that one.
He looks fucking harmless.

1152
01:00:25,094 --> 01:00:27,255
( growls )

1153
01:00:27,297 --> 01:00:29,026
Check out
Mens there, though.

1154
01:00:29,065 --> 01:00:31,397
That's pain and pleasure.
That's his jizz face.

1155
01:00:33,303 --> 01:00:35,533
I was smiling like that last night
when I sat on the toilet

1156
01:00:35,572 --> 01:00:39,099
with this hot jet
of water spraying my cornhole.

1157
01:00:42,812 --> 01:00:44,302
Panch, I think
you're the closest one

1158
01:00:44,347 --> 01:00:46,338
resembling one
of those wrestlers.

1159
01:00:46,382 --> 01:00:48,509
- I think they're gonna--
- I probably look like numerous ones

1160
01:00:48,551 --> 01:00:51,520
seeing as I look like fucking everyone
under the sun anyway.

1161
01:00:53,656 --> 01:00:55,521
You've looked like--
you've looked like--

1162
01:00:55,558 --> 01:00:58,083
you've looked like
the Incredible Hulk,

1163
01:00:58,127 --> 01:00:59,856
you've looked like
fucking Gorbachev...

1164
01:00:59,896 --> 01:01:03,093
"I want the U.S.S.R.
To continue the way it is."

1165
01:01:03,132 --> 01:01:05,828
...and now you look
like every one of these on there.

1166
01:01:05,868 --> 01:01:08,359
All the baldies.

1167
01:01:11,007 --> 01:01:14,807
- Fucking Jesus Christ!
- That's fucking barbed wire.

1168
01:01:14,844 --> 01:01:17,404
- Hello.
- Oh my God.

1169
01:01:17,447 --> 01:01:20,883
I think we've got into
a bit of shit here, boys.

1170
01:01:24,087 --> 01:01:27,682
We've got our own costumes,
our own little funny costumes.

1171
01:01:27,724 --> 01:01:29,692
Yeah, we have.

1172
01:01:30,793 --> 01:01:32,260
Put our--
put our outfits on.

1173
01:01:35,632 --> 01:01:37,657
Watch it,
I'll knock you out, mate!

1174
01:01:38,701 --> 01:01:41,363
I got my--
I got my own--

1175
01:01:41,404 --> 01:01:43,838
whoa! Whoa!

1176
01:01:45,575 --> 01:01:47,634
Don't push--
don't push me in!

1177
01:01:47,677 --> 01:01:49,235
( laughing )

1178
01:02:06,696 --> 01:02:08,687
( laughing )

1179
01:02:22,578 --> 01:02:24,808
We was laughing earlier.

1180
01:02:24,847 --> 01:02:26,712
That's definitely
a nervous grin now.

1181
01:02:29,218 --> 01:02:30,480
He's pointing at me.

1182
01:02:33,956 --> 01:02:36,288
Ah! Ah!

1183
01:02:41,564 --> 01:02:43,725
Fucking hell!

1184
01:02:52,275 --> 01:02:53,799
Whoa whoa whoa!

1185
01:02:59,882 --> 01:03:01,440
Right, your fucking turn!

1186
01:03:14,130 --> 01:03:16,257
No no no.
No more.

1187
01:03:18,534 --> 01:03:22,129
- Oh! Look at that!
- That kick in the back is fucked.

1188
01:03:24,006 --> 01:03:26,304
Go on!
Get off me!

1189
01:03:32,482 --> 01:03:35,781
- Hey, you.
- Get in, get in, get in.

1190
01:03:37,954 --> 01:03:39,012
Oh, he's fucked.

1191
01:03:44,727 --> 01:03:45,853
He's pinned his dick!

1192
01:03:50,099 --> 01:03:52,590
- That looked fucking savage, that.
- Oh, it was horrible, man.

1193
01:03:52,635 --> 01:03:54,227
And they played
with your cock and all.

1194
01:03:54,270 --> 01:03:55,897
- They stretched it a bit, though.
- I know. I know.

1195
01:03:55,938 --> 01:03:57,599
There was
no thrill in that.

1196
01:03:59,709 --> 01:04:02,337
- Look at his tail.
- It's all in the tail, isn't it?

1197
01:04:11,554 --> 01:04:13,021
( choking )

1198
01:04:14,624 --> 01:04:17,320
- Pigsy!
- Pigsy! Me monkey!

1199
01:04:19,428 --> 01:04:21,953
Dainton: Look at them all!
Look at them all!

1200
01:04:29,872 --> 01:04:32,204
Right, let's go
get drunk, boys!

1201
01:04:33,976 --> 01:04:36,536
What are we doing inviting these boys
out on the piss with us in Japan?

1202
01:04:36,579 --> 01:04:39,070
- I don't know. Let's go.
- We're professional drinkers, though.

1203
01:04:39,115 --> 01:04:41,481
- Yeah.
- Time for some saki.

1204
01:04:45,454 --> 01:04:48,355
- Saki!
- Ah!

1205
01:04:48,391 --> 01:04:50,382
Son of a bitch.

1206
01:04:50,426 --> 01:04:53,156
The Japanese extreme wrestlers
have stripped us of our pride...

1207
01:04:53,196 --> 01:04:55,164
so we're gonna play
a good old, er--

1208
01:04:55,198 --> 01:04:57,098
a game that
we do back in Wales...

1209
01:04:57,133 --> 01:04:58,464
and we're gonna
flip the box.

1210
01:04:58,501 --> 01:05:01,095
Whichever end this lands on...
equals a forfeit.

1211
01:05:01,137 --> 01:05:03,367
- Good man.
- I reckon he's gonna get green.

1212
01:05:05,775 --> 01:05:08,972
- ( vocalizes tune )
- Ooh.

1213
01:05:09,011 --> 01:05:13,004
He's just picked the mallet
with the pins on it,

1214
01:05:13,049 --> 01:05:14,846
and he's chosen
to go for the shoulder.

1215
01:05:14,884 --> 01:05:16,579
And to tell you the truth,
I don't wanna fucking hit him,

1216
01:05:16,619 --> 01:05:18,018
because he's
bigger than me.

1217
01:05:18,054 --> 01:05:20,113
- Check out-- check out the scars.
- And look at the scars.

1218
01:05:20,156 --> 01:05:21,817
Check out the scars
on this guy.

1219
01:05:21,858 --> 01:05:23,223
We thought we had
a lot of fucking scars.

1220
01:05:23,259 --> 01:05:25,659
And do you think
that's gonna do fuck all to him?

1221
01:05:25,695 --> 01:05:29,358
Three, two--
oh, I don't wanna do it!

1222
01:05:29,398 --> 01:05:31,696
- Come on.
- That hurt my pride.

1223
01:05:33,469 --> 01:05:37,667
- You want more?
- I don't -- I don't like.

1224
01:05:43,913 --> 01:05:45,813
Eeny meeny miney moe...

1225
01:05:45,848 --> 01:05:47,543
( whispers )
Please have the nasty one.

1226
01:05:47,583 --> 01:05:51,246
It's only the fucking staple
to the tongue, isn't it?

1227
01:05:59,662 --> 01:06:01,755
Stay stay, Pancho.
Stay stay.

1228
01:06:04,166 --> 01:06:05,531
It's in!

1229
01:06:19,649 --> 01:06:21,879
This is
my first time in Japan.

1230
01:06:21,918 --> 01:06:23,647
I don't even
like mustard,

1231
01:06:23,686 --> 01:06:25,415
so let's taste wasabi.

1232
01:06:25,454 --> 01:06:27,615
Because if
I don't like this

1233
01:06:27,657 --> 01:06:30,558
and this is going
up Pritchard's nose, God forbid.

1234
01:06:33,930 --> 01:06:36,057
Let's have a taste.

1235
01:06:36,098 --> 01:06:38,726
Ooh, that's a selfish line.

1236
01:06:38,768 --> 01:06:40,963
I'm Welsh, Daniel,
I don't fuck around.

1237
01:06:41,003 --> 01:06:42,436
Oh Jesus.

1238
01:06:42,471 --> 01:06:45,497
Not only is it just wasabi,
it's mixed with saki.

1239
01:06:48,911 --> 01:06:52,369
Three, two, one,
in "Sanchez" style, goodbye!

1240
01:06:53,783 --> 01:06:55,114
( snorts )

1241
01:06:56,252 --> 01:06:57,810
( hacks )

1242
01:07:04,927 --> 01:07:06,895
( cheering )

1243
01:07:08,631 --> 01:07:11,498
( all chanting )
Wasabi, wasabi, wasabi...

1244
01:07:13,536 --> 01:07:15,731
All:
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

1245
01:07:39,495 --> 01:07:43,022
( random people
speaking Japanese )

1246
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:16,596
( knocks )

1247
01:08:58,374 --> 01:09:00,035
Found it, boyo.

1248
01:09:00,076 --> 01:09:02,772
It's the one with the fucking ring
round it and the blade.

1249
01:09:04,180 --> 01:09:06,148
How you feeling?

1250
01:09:07,750 --> 01:09:10,275
The best way to--
to slice one's finger off--

1251
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:13,880
one, two, three,
four, five.

1252
01:09:16,892 --> 01:09:18,951
Fucking hell, Panch!

1253
01:09:18,994 --> 01:09:21,485
Just like
the Yakuza do, baby!

1254
01:09:21,530 --> 01:09:23,828
Put that fucking hand
down now.

1255
01:09:25,134 --> 01:09:26,999
We're here.
Are you ready?

1256
01:09:27,036 --> 01:09:28,503
I'm fucking shitting myself.

1257
01:09:28,537 --> 01:09:30,528
Panch, how many fucking drinks
have you had tonight?

1258
01:09:30,573 --> 01:09:32,234
Look, I'll even do the piss test.

1259
01:09:32,274 --> 01:09:35,266
I'm gonna fucking get my pride back
by chopping my finger off.

1260
01:09:37,980 --> 01:09:40,778
Pritch, you're not gonna chop it off,
though-- Pancho is.

1261
01:09:43,219 --> 01:09:45,346
- Pancho ain't fucking doing it.
- He fucking is.

1262
01:09:45,387 --> 01:09:47,218
- Fuck off, he's a fucking pisshead.
- Pritch, Pritch.

1263
01:09:47,256 --> 01:09:49,224
( Joycey laughing )

1264
01:09:49,258 --> 01:09:51,249
Whoa whoa whoa whoa!

1265
01:09:51,293 --> 01:09:54,262
- Whoa whoa!
- Felt like Dogtanian for a minute.

1266
01:09:54,296 --> 01:09:57,322
This is the tip of his finger, and this
is how far in we wanna go.

1267
01:09:58,434 --> 01:10:00,163
Right, here we go.

1268
01:10:02,171 --> 01:10:04,139
Pancho set the gauntlet.

1269
01:10:04,173 --> 01:10:08,041
Daint, he can't even fucking shoot
a gun fucking straight.

1270
01:10:08,077 --> 01:10:10,102
- I'll put my finger there, Jim.
- And I'm gonna go...

1271
01:10:10,146 --> 01:10:12,307
- Oh!
- If I manage to have

1272
01:10:12,348 --> 01:10:14,976
my finger chopped off
by Pancho...

1273
01:10:15,017 --> 01:10:20,011
you have to stand in the middle
of a Japanese street singing karaoke

1274
01:10:20,055 --> 01:10:23,388
- with a song of my choice.
- Well, that's a deal, Pritch.

1275
01:10:23,425 --> 01:10:25,325
You're too pissed,
you're too fucking clumsy.

1276
01:10:25,361 --> 01:10:27,226
- You ain't fucking doing my finger.
- I'm fine.

1277
01:10:27,263 --> 01:10:29,823
- Look, Panch, you're not doing it.
- Joycey: How you gonna do it?

1278
01:10:29,865 --> 01:10:32,163
I chose myself
the cigar cutter.

1279
01:10:32,201 --> 01:10:35,136
- That's a very classy way of doing it.
- I'm a posh man, Daniel.

1280
01:10:35,171 --> 01:10:38,197
Well, to tell you the truth,

1281
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:41,869
I'm fucking...
shitting myself.

1282
01:10:41,911 --> 01:10:44,106
- Panch.
- I don't even wanna look.

1283
01:10:44,146 --> 01:10:45,773
I didn't want to be affiliated
with this anyway.

1284
01:10:45,814 --> 01:10:48,510
- Well, he's bats. Use your reason.
- Yeah.

1285
01:10:48,551 --> 01:10:50,246
Are you sure, Pritch,
are you sure?

1286
01:10:50,286 --> 01:10:51,981
- Time to moan.
- Definite?

1287
01:10:52,021 --> 01:10:53,682
- I can't even look.
- Right. Are you ready?

1288
01:10:53,722 --> 01:10:56,418
- Go.
- Three, two, one.

to Hurt Me?" playing )

# Do you really want
to hurt me? #

1291

Fuck a duck!
Motherfucker!

1292
01:11:07,303 --> 01:11:11,637
- Fucking hell, man.
- Yeah, it's fucking right off, boys.

1293
01:11:11,674 --> 01:11:14,336
Boys, I've fucking
regained my pride!

the fire's burning... #

find a star... #

Boys, I can see
the fucking bone.

1298
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:27,047
- I can see the fucking bone.
- Fuck off!

1299
01:11:27,089 --> 01:11:31,526
- Fuck off!
- Oh, fuck. Fuck a duck!

1300
01:11:34,163 --> 01:11:37,132
Yeah, motherfucker!
I've regained my pride!

1301

Who's fucking
pussy boy now?!

1302
01:11:39,935 --> 01:11:42,870
I may have lost the fight,
but I've regained my pride.

1303
01:11:42,905 --> 01:11:45,237
- Look, it's still in the end there!
- Oh, fucking hell.

01:11:45,274 --> 01:11:47,799
- Math, can I eat it?!
- No no, don't fuck around!

1305
01:11:47,843 --> 01:11:49,936
- Eat it. Eat it.
- Can I eat it?

1306

- No, don't fucking eat it!
- I wanted to--

1307
01:11:52,448 --> 01:11:53,574
No, you can't
fucking eat it!

1308
01:11:53,616 --> 01:11:55,311
- Eat it.
- No!

1309

- Eat it!
- No, don't, don't!

Dan, don't fucking eat it!

- Go on, Dan!
- Don't eat it!

1312

It tastes
fucking weird, man!

But this pink guy is
now a fucking superhero.

And this superhero is
called Pinky Dinky Dainty,

and he's gonna
fuck Pritchard's world.

Today is the day
where we meet Myke Hawke.

1323

He's gonna take us
into the desert,

1324
01:12:45,367 --> 01:12:48,598
and we're gonna spend two days
in this fucking soaring heat...

1325
01:12:48,637 --> 01:12:51,470
er, just living off the desert,
basically. And Myke Hawke...

1326
01:12:52,941 --> 01:12:54,568
is gonna teach us
how to fucking do it.

1327
01:13:05,421 --> 01:13:08,254
Like a bike.
Kick him, kick him over like a bike.

1328
01:13:09,858 --> 01:13:11,416
You don't kick
a bike over like that!

1329
01:13:12,461 --> 01:13:14,019
Where's the fucking Hawke?

1330
01:13:15,297 --> 01:13:17,527
- No, don't do that, man.
- Leave it there.

1331
01:13:17,566 --> 01:13:19,659
It's cursed.

1332
01:13:20,836 --> 01:13:22,167
It's like
you don't fucking go

1333
01:13:22,204 --> 01:13:24,604
and fuck with
Tutankhamen's tomb, do you?

1334
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:26,403
Well, you just fisted
a fucking dead cow.

1335
01:13:27,743 --> 01:13:29,734
I'm fisting a cow!

1336

Oh, that's a bit of love.

1337
01:13:34,249 --> 01:13:36,444
Oh my God.
What the fuck is that?!

1338
01:13:36,485 --> 01:13:39,818
- Who the fuck is this?
- Is this Myke Hawke?

1339
01:13:41,090 --> 01:13:43,615
- All right, Myke?
- You miserable,

1340
01:13:43,659 --> 01:13:46,651
gluttonous... maggots.

1341

You've been stuffing chow
down your pieholes...

throwing booze
down your throat.

1346
01:14:00,542 --> 01:14:03,010
And now you're gonna pay
for your sins.

1347
01:14:03,045 --> 01:14:05,513
- Oh, fuck.
- For your gluttony...

1348
01:14:05,547 --> 01:14:08,141
this is the reckoning.

1349
01:14:08,183 --> 01:14:11,448
And we're getting ready to get
downright primitive on your ass.

1350
01:14:11,487 --> 01:14:14,115
My name is Hawke...

1351
01:14:14,156 --> 01:14:17,717
and we're getting ready to have
what I call a come-to-Jesus party.

1352
01:14:18,861 --> 01:14:20,920
Look at that
fucking cock!

1353
01:14:20,963 --> 01:14:23,625
- What is that?
- You've got a big wart on yours.

1354
01:14:23,665 --> 01:14:26,133
- Daint.
- It's a dick, what do you think it is?

1355
01:14:26,168 --> 01:14:28,193
- You've been getting a bit of wind?
- No, there's no wind.

1356
01:14:28,237 --> 01:14:29,704
- That's how my dick is.
- That's a semi.

1357
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:34,567
Joycey: So, Hawke,
are you scared of anything?

1358
01:14:34,609 --> 01:14:37,043
Hawke:
To be quite honest-- no.

1359
01:14:37,078 --> 01:14:39,706
I mean, the way
I look at it is...

1360
01:14:39,747 --> 01:14:44,684
everything that's alive can be killed.
And I'm pretty mean.

1361
01:14:44,719 --> 01:14:47,517
- Pritchard: Ever done dry bumming?
- Hawke: Dry bumming?

1362
01:14:48,755 --> 01:14:51,849
Okay, gents, now it's time
to do a little bit of hunting.

1363
01:14:51,892 --> 01:14:54,622
Okay, got a couple
of techniques for you.

1364
01:14:54,661 --> 01:14:56,492
One is a bola.

1365
01:14:56,530 --> 01:14:58,293
- Are you familiar with that?
- No.

1366
01:15:00,734 --> 01:15:03,760
- ( Joycey laughing )
- ( screams )

1367
01:15:03,804 --> 01:15:06,238
- My jones!
- Good old-fashioned slingshot.

1368
01:15:06,273 --> 01:15:07,638
Ready?

1369
01:15:09,209 --> 01:15:11,177
Now, the whole thing about
these little critters--

1370
01:15:11,211 --> 01:15:13,441
- they die easy.
- Hands out of the way!

1371
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:15,311
Daint,
you're pulling back.

1372
01:15:15,348 --> 01:15:17,179
Bollocks!
You fucking try it!

1373
01:15:17,217 --> 01:15:19,617
So once you whack him,
go up there and stomp on his head

1374
01:15:19,653 --> 01:15:21,587
or club his head or something
to make sure you finish him off.

1375
01:15:21,621 --> 01:15:23,919
( guys laugh )

1376
01:15:23,957 --> 01:15:25,891
And then you gotta practice
a little bit with it

1377
01:15:25,926 --> 01:15:27,894
- so you get your aim down.
- Fat ass, are you ready?

1378
01:15:27,928 --> 01:15:31,887
- No, but carry on.
- That hit his plums!

1379
01:15:31,932 --> 01:15:33,661
That hit
his fucking plums!

1380
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:35,668
You've smacked the plate
in my arm where my arm is broke.

1381
01:15:35,702 --> 01:15:37,932
How I fucking missed that ass,
I don't fucking know.

1382
01:15:37,971 --> 01:15:40,405
Lesson one:

1383
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:42,840
Don't play with these.

1384
01:15:44,411 --> 01:15:46,402

01:16:02,095 --> 01:16:04,893
All right, ladies--
it's that time.

1386
01:16:04,931 --> 01:16:06,296
( Hawke speaking )

1387
01:16:06,333 --> 01:16:08,699
That's a snake,
isn't it?

1388
01:16:08,735 --> 01:16:10,566
Hold out your hand
and receive your chow.

1389
01:16:10,604 --> 01:16:14,040
- Joycey: Oh, no!
- Dainton: Holy shit!

1390
01:16:14,074 --> 01:16:16,668
That's it.
You've got it.

1391
01:16:18,879 --> 01:16:20,813
I don't want it
going up my top.

1392
01:16:25,352 --> 01:16:28,048
Oh, man, I don't know
if I can do this.

1393
01:16:28,088 --> 01:16:30,454
- ( yelling )
- Just poke it--

1394
01:16:30,490 --> 01:16:32,355
Oh, fuck!

1395
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:35,624
He stung you?

1396
01:16:35,662 --> 01:16:37,892
- Oh, you can't do that!
- Hawke: There you go.

1397
01:16:37,931 --> 01:16:39,455
- Now cook it.
- Oh, you can't do it.

1398
01:16:39,499 --> 01:16:41,490
- Hawke: Cook it.
- I just have.

1399
01:16:41,535 --> 01:16:43,560
Joycey: How the fuck
did Panch just do that, man?

1400
01:16:43,603 --> 01:16:45,901
- Fuck! Fucking hell!
- It's still alive.

1401
01:16:45,939 --> 01:16:49,204
- Oh, I'm starving.
- Put him back on the normal floor.

1402
01:16:49,242 --> 01:16:51,437
Oh my fucking God,
he's eating the fucking sting!

1403
01:16:51,478 --> 01:16:54,379
- Not much flavor to him...
- There you go.

1404
01:16:54,414 --> 01:16:55,881
- Just like that.
- ...but it's food,

1405
01:16:55,916 --> 01:16:57,383
and my stomach
is fucking loving it.

1406
01:16:57,417 --> 01:16:59,282
I can't believe
you fucking did that.

1407
01:16:59,319 --> 01:17:01,150
- I'm not doing that.
- I know what's coming to me,

1408
01:17:01,187 --> 01:17:02,814
- I think.
- You can't eat spiders though.

1409
01:17:02,856 --> 01:17:07,293
- Fuck.
- Oh my God! No no no!

1410
01:17:07,327 --> 01:17:10,694
Fucking no!
I'll fucking starve.

1411
01:17:10,730 --> 01:17:13,756
- But killing it--
- lamscaredoffuckingspiders.com

1412
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:16,268
This is looking one
in the face--

1413
01:17:16,303 --> 01:17:19,295
that you're afraid of--
stabbing that fucker...

1414
01:17:19,339 --> 01:17:20,772
It will bite me.

1415
01:17:20,807 --> 01:17:22,240
...and eating it.
No, he won't.

1416
01:17:26,379 --> 01:17:28,643
That's a big, bad,
furry bastard right there.

1417
01:17:28,682 --> 01:17:30,479
Whack him.

1418
01:17:30,517 --> 01:17:32,451
Get your knife ready.
Get your knife ready.

1419
01:17:32,485 --> 01:17:34,976
Oh! Daint!
Don't fuck around now!

1420
01:17:35,021 --> 01:17:36,215
I've got a fucking knife
in my hand!

1421
01:17:36,256 --> 01:17:38,121
I could easily
stab you and cook you!

1422
01:17:38,158 --> 01:17:41,389
Actually, that's --
I fucking almost span out.

1423
01:17:46,833 --> 01:17:49,393
- There it is.
- Fucking hell!

1424
01:17:49,436 --> 01:17:51,131
Put it on the fire.
Straight on the fire.

1425
01:17:51,171 --> 01:17:54,038
He's gonna cry.
He's gonna cry.

1426
01:17:54,074 --> 01:17:56,406
- He's in tears.
- What's the matter, Math?

1427
01:17:56,443 --> 01:17:59,435
- Joycey: What's the matter?
- Dainton: Oh, that's fucking wrong.

1428
01:18:01,414 --> 01:18:03,939
Just rip off a limb,
stuff it down your throat.

1429
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:09,245
( Dainton gags )

1430
01:18:09,289 --> 01:18:11,689
- There you go, you've done it.
- You're in, you're in.

1431
01:18:11,725 --> 01:18:14,353
- Chew chew chew.
- ( strained ) Oh, crikey.

1432
01:18:16,630 --> 01:18:20,794
- Way to lead.
- Cheers, Hawke, you fucking cunt.

1433
01:18:20,834 --> 01:18:23,166
( hip-hop music playing )

1434
01:18:38,283 --> 01:18:41,309
I know you boys are hungry,
I know you've worked hard...

1435
01:18:41,353 --> 01:18:43,913
and I promised you
some Kentucky Fried Chicken.

1436
01:18:43,956 --> 01:18:46,220
So, I am from Kentucky...

1437
01:18:46,258 --> 01:18:49,284
this is a chicken
and you're gonna fry it.

1438
01:18:49,328 --> 01:18:51,091
Boys, I'm not doing this
for the fun of it.

1439
01:18:51,129 --> 01:18:52,653
- Well then, let's get on with it.
- Pritch.

1440
01:18:52,698 --> 01:18:54,359
- Most humane way, please. I'm starving.
- Dan?

1441
01:18:54,399 --> 01:18:55,923
- Yeah, no, I'm --
- He's watching.

1442
01:18:55,968 --> 01:18:57,959
If you're ready to do it
your way, that's cool.

1443
01:18:58,003 --> 01:19:00,597
- Dan, do you wanna do it?
- I wanna go for the machete.

1444
01:19:00,639 --> 01:19:01,731
That's the only way
I wanna do it,

1445
01:19:01,773 --> 01:19:03,172
because I don't like
touching fucking birds.

1446
01:19:03,208 --> 01:19:04,766
We've gotta fucking eat
something, boys.

1447
01:19:04,810 --> 01:19:06,641
We have to eat something.
He's gotta--

1448
01:19:06,678 --> 01:19:08,839
- Which way do you want me to kill him?
- Would you do the boot?

1449
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:10,404
I'm not-- I'm not--
I'm not doing it.

1450
01:19:10,449 --> 01:19:12,110
- I'm not even eating it.
- You're not eating it?

1451
01:19:12,150 --> 01:19:14,243
If I can't kill it,
I'm not eating it. No way.

1452
01:19:14,286 --> 01:19:16,083
- ( groans )
- Just pray for him,

1453
01:19:16,121 --> 01:19:17,884
send him to a happy place.

1454
01:19:22,928 --> 01:19:24,759
( clucking )

1455
01:19:31,970 --> 01:19:33,961
( melancholy music playing )

1456
01:19:36,641 --> 01:19:38,404
Pritchard:
I think the only fact I couldn't eat it

1457
01:19:38,443 --> 01:19:40,274
is because
it's more domesticated.

1458
01:19:40,312 --> 01:19:41,939
It actually looks like
it's got feelings and stuff.

1459
01:19:41,980 --> 01:19:44,448
You look at a fucking
tarantula and a scorpion...

1460
01:19:44,483 --> 01:19:46,917
to me, they haven't
got feelings.

1461
01:19:46,952 --> 01:19:48,647
They're just this thing
that walks along the floor

1462
01:19:48,687 --> 01:19:50,780
and just looks horrible and ugly.

1463
01:19:50,822 --> 01:19:52,915
But a chicken looks nice--
it's feathery,

1464
01:19:52,958 --> 01:19:54,789
looks like it's got
a bit of personality.

1465
01:19:54,826 --> 01:19:56,487
- It's, you know--
- Dainton: Pritch, what do you want--

1466
01:19:56,528 --> 01:19:59,326
- leg or breast?
- Breast.

1467
01:19:59,364 --> 01:20:01,525
He's actually quite nice.

1468
01:20:01,566 --> 01:20:02,999
- Dainton: What's his name?
- Derek.

1469
01:20:03,035 --> 01:20:05,868
- Derek?
- Derek. Derek the chicken.

1470
01:20:10,642 --> 01:20:14,009
What we have here
is a very simple...

1471
01:20:14,046 --> 01:20:16,446
case of mind over matter.

1472
01:20:17,916 --> 01:20:21,283
I don't mind
and they don't matter.

1473
01:20:24,656 --> 01:20:27,853
- ( guys laugh )
- But seriously,

1474
01:20:27,893 --> 01:20:30,361
once they've walked
across the fire...

1475
01:20:30,395 --> 01:20:32,761
then they've paid their penance
for their sin of gluttony

1476
01:20:32,798 --> 01:20:35,392
and they'll be free to relax
and enjoy themselves

1477
01:20:35,434 --> 01:20:37,231
until go on their way
to their next mission.

1478
01:20:37,269 --> 01:20:39,032
( Hawke speaking )

1479
01:20:44,743 --> 01:20:46,540
Joycey: Yes!

1480
01:20:46,578 --> 01:20:48,876
Ah! Eeh. Ooh.

1481
01:20:48,914 --> 01:20:50,905
- Whew.
- Joycey: How is it?

1482
01:20:50,949 --> 01:20:52,940
- Whoo!
- ( blues playing )

1483
01:21:01,126 --> 01:21:03,754
- That is some mean shit!
- ( Dainton laughs )

1484
01:21:09,067 --> 01:21:11,001
- Pritchard: Ready, boys?
- Pancho: Come on, Pritch.

1485
01:21:11,036 --> 01:21:13,402
Three, two, one.

1486
01:21:13,438 --> 01:21:15,963
( screams )

1487
01:21:19,678 --> 01:21:21,703
( belches )

1488
01:21:24,516 --> 01:21:26,416
Let's do it.

1489
01:21:41,233 --> 01:21:44,964
Hawke, have you enjoyed the time
you've spent with us?

1490
01:21:45,003 --> 01:21:47,471
- It's been better than masturbation.
- ( guys laughing )

1491
01:21:49,508 --> 01:21:52,409
- Oh, what?
- Oh, this is so fucking gay!

1492
01:21:53,912 --> 01:21:55,709
Are we ready
to leave the desert?

1493
01:21:55,747 --> 01:21:58,307
Almost.

1494
01:21:58,350 --> 01:22:00,477
You have
one more thing to do.

1495
01:22:00,519 --> 01:22:02,783
Oh, fuck off.

1496
01:22:02,821 --> 01:22:04,686
You've got one minute

1497
01:22:04,723 --> 01:22:07,692
to crack all
the Myke Hawke jokes...

1498
01:22:08,693 --> 01:22:10,558
that you can.

1499
01:22:10,595 --> 01:22:13,564
I'm holding the head
of Myke Hawke.

1500
01:22:13,598 --> 01:22:15,156
That's enough.

1501
01:22:17,035 --> 01:22:19,196
Thank you very much.

1502
01:22:19,237 --> 01:22:22,638
Gentlemen, you've paid
your full penance

1503
01:22:22,674 --> 01:22:23,800
for your sin
of gluttony...

1504
01:22:23,842 --> 01:22:25,901
and you are now

1505
01:22:25,944 --> 01:22:28,879
- free to leave the desert.
- ( both cheer )

1506
01:22:29,247 --> 01:22:31,545
Pritchard:
Party time, boys!

1507
01:22:31,583 --> 01:22:33,574
( "You Got to Leave" playing )

1508
01:22:38,723 --> 01:22:40,884
# Who'd have thought,
who'd have thought #

1509
01:22:40,926 --> 01:22:42,951
# You'd get the devil
down on his knee? #

1510
01:22:42,994 --> 01:22:44,723
# Holy smoke, holy smoke #

1511
01:22:44,763 --> 01:22:47,755
# Only if you will remain #

1512
01:22:47,799 --> 01:22:50,359
# Hot time
down on the ground #

1513
01:22:50,402 --> 01:22:53,838
# You're causing a crowd,
the trouble is pride #

1514
01:22:53,872 --> 01:22:57,831
# And you are pointing it wide,
when it's dark it's dark #

1515
01:22:57,876 --> 01:23:00,709
# And you will lose
your heart #

1516

# Pick it up and go back
to the start... #

1517
01:23:07,752 --> 01:23:09,947
Dainton:
Right, simple. Dead easy.

1518
01:23:09,988 --> 01:23:12,013
Stuff as much of this
in your mouth as you can.

1519
01:23:12,057 --> 01:23:13,957
The person that takes the least amount
of money in their mouth

1520
01:23:13,992 --> 01:23:16,552
has gotta make a simple
phone call to their mom.

1521
01:23:16,595 --> 01:23:18,358
Yeah, but there's
a distinct disadvantage here.

1522
01:23:18,396 --> 01:23:20,489
I haven't played up
on the small-man thing.

1523
01:23:20,532 --> 01:23:22,625
You know, I've done fucking
all the stunts so far.

1524
01:23:22,667 --> 01:23:24,828
But look at my gob.

1525
01:23:26,004 --> 01:23:27,801
That's how far
I can open it.

1526
01:23:27,839 --> 01:23:29,932
The dentist has even told me
I've got a problem.

1527
01:23:29,975 --> 01:23:31,806
( laughing )

1528
01:23:36,014 --> 01:23:37,914
Go.

1529
01:23:45,490 --> 01:23:48,550
Oh God, he's being sick!
30 seconds, Panch.

1530
01:23:50,929 --> 01:23:52,521
25 seconds, Pritch.

1531
01:23:52,564 --> 01:23:55,032
Oh, that's semi-cheating that is.

1532
01:23:57,035 --> 01:24:00,163
It'll make you heave.
( gags )

1533

Joycey:
Fucking what?

1534
01:24:14,653 --> 01:24:18,020
Well that's fucking--
that's fucking unfair.

1535
01:24:18,056 --> 01:24:20,490
Who had the least amount
of money in their mouth?

1536
01:24:22,494 --> 01:24:24,621
- It's a fix, Daint.
- It's always a fix.

1537
01:24:24,663 --> 01:24:26,756
Well, you said
get your money in your mouth.

1538
01:24:26,798 --> 01:24:28,356
Everyone has
just gone like that.

1539
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:30,300
No, because there was no rules,
just "put the money in your mouth."

1540
01:24:30,335 --> 01:24:32,166
Well make it
more clear next time.

1541
01:24:32,203 --> 01:24:33,761
Well, it's too late now,
you've lost.

1542
01:24:33,805 --> 01:24:35,796
Did you or did you
not say that the winners

1543
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:37,933
get to write
the loser's script?

1544
01:24:37,976 --> 01:24:40,035
- Yeah, I did, yeah.
- Dainton: Exactly. What are we doing?

1545
01:24:40,078 --> 01:24:42,911
We're writing
the loser's script.

1546
01:24:44,082 --> 01:24:45,879
Oh, no!

1547
01:24:45,917 --> 01:24:49,284
Joycey, don't be
too fucking sick, for fuck's sake.

1548
01:24:56,861 --> 01:24:58,692
Right.

1549
01:24:58,730 --> 01:25:00,425
( Pritchard's mom speaking )

1550
01:25:00,465 --> 01:25:03,491
Hiya, Mom.

1551
01:25:03,535 --> 01:25:06,470
How you doing?

1552
01:25:06,504 --> 01:25:09,564
Yeah, not bad. Just in
the Dominican Republic.

1553
01:25:12,177 --> 01:25:14,873
"Mom, from the moment
I was born

1554
01:25:14,913 --> 01:25:17,040
I have been thinking
of returning

1555
01:25:17,082 --> 01:25:19,448
to that special
heavenly place,

1556
01:25:19,484 --> 01:25:22,009
those lips parting
across my face

1557
01:25:22,053 --> 01:25:24,248
as you pushed me out...

1558
01:25:24,289 --> 01:25:26,382
of your heavenly
love hole.

1559
01:25:28,193 --> 01:25:30,684
I want-- I want
to return where I belong.

1560
01:25:30,729 --> 01:25:32,629
I want to put my lips

1561
01:25:32,664 --> 01:25:35,428
around your soft delicious
nipples once again."

1562
01:25:35,467 --> 01:25:36,900
- ( mother laughing )
- "The thoughts I have

1563
01:25:36,935 --> 01:25:40,200
for you are uncontrollable.

1564
01:25:42,874 --> 01:25:45,707
L-- I want--
I want--

1565
01:25:45,744 --> 01:25:47,371
I want
to dry bum you."

1566
01:25:52,550 --> 01:25:54,017
- Pritchard!
- Sorry I offended you.

1567
01:25:54,052 --> 01:25:55,679
Right, speak to you later.

1568
01:25:55,720 --> 01:25:57,711
- Ta-ta. Ta-ta.
- Ta-ta, love.

1569
01:25:59,057 --> 01:26:00,684
Wankers!

1570
01:26:10,402 --> 01:26:12,700
( Joycey imitating pirate )
Let me tell you about the angry pirate.

1571
01:26:12,737 --> 01:26:15,934
Bird is giving you a blow-job,
she is, see. Enjoying it down there.

1572
01:26:15,974 --> 01:26:18,135
You're about to reach
the point of climax, about to cum,

1573
01:26:18,176 --> 01:26:20,610
so you pull your cock out of her mouth
and spunk in her eye.

1574
01:26:20,645 --> 01:26:22,340
And then she's
all sore in her eye.

1575
01:26:22,380 --> 01:26:24,780
You kick the little bird
in the shin, she hobbles around

1576
01:26:24,816 --> 01:26:26,681
- like an angry pirate.
- ( guys laughing )

1577
01:26:26,718 --> 01:26:29,448
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're gonna give

1578
01:26:29,487 --> 01:26:31,717
the angry pirate a go.
We're gonna go with some rum.

1579
01:26:31,756 --> 01:26:34,316
Three, two, one.

1580
01:26:36,394 --> 01:26:40,125
Ar! Ar! Ar!
Fucking hell!

1581
01:26:41,699 --> 01:26:44,190
What the fuck is that?!
Fucking acid!

1582
01:26:44,235 --> 01:26:46,567
Three, two, one.

1583
01:26:46,604 --> 01:26:48,595
( yelling )

1584
01:26:49,774 --> 01:26:52,140
Open your eye, open your eye!
Open your eye!

1585
01:26:52,177 --> 01:26:55,374
( grunts, yelling )

1586
01:26:57,248 --> 01:26:59,216
Dainton:
Open your eye! Open it!

1587
01:26:59,250 --> 01:27:02,242
- ( yelling )
- Shin! Shin!

1588
01:27:06,224 --> 01:27:08,089
Open up.
Open up.

1589
01:27:08,126 --> 01:27:09,991
- Oh my God, it's --
- You're not angry enough.

1590
01:27:10,028 --> 01:27:12,519
- You're not angry enough.
- Arr!

1591
01:27:12,564 --> 01:27:14,725
Pancho, last night
when you were asleep in the car,

1592
01:27:14,766 --> 01:27:17,166
we nicked your money
and spent it in a casino!

1593
01:27:18,336 --> 01:27:19,928
Right, over there
is a vehicle.

1594
01:27:19,971 --> 01:27:22,804
Who's inside it?
Well, someone is missing.

1595
01:27:22,841 --> 01:27:24,832
( snoring )

1596
01:27:29,314 --> 01:27:32,078
Is that a-- is that
a bifta in your hand?

1597
01:27:33,084 --> 01:27:34,745
( groans )

1598
01:27:38,056 --> 01:27:39,887
Get the fuck off.

1599
01:27:39,924 --> 01:27:42,154
I thought there's no way
I'd lost that money!

1600
01:27:42,193 --> 01:27:43,990
- It was in my shirt, wasn't it?
- We lost it!

1601
01:27:45,263 --> 01:27:46,890
Hang on a minute.

1602
01:27:46,931 --> 01:27:49,491
I've just found his money,
and I'm one greedy bastard.

1603
01:27:49,534 --> 01:27:52,503
I'm gonna spend it in a casino.
Ta-ta, Panch.

1604
01:27:58,576 --> 01:27:59,873
Right, Captain Panch.

1605
01:27:59,911 --> 01:28:02,175
Do you wanna win
that money back that we took

1606
01:28:02,213 --> 01:28:05,273
- and stole from you our greedy selves?
- Fucking right, bud.

1607
01:28:06,618 --> 01:28:09,485
Pirates of Pain-zance,
let the pain begin!

1608
01:28:09,521 --> 01:28:12,115
- Go on, Panch, get that money.
- Go on, go on.

1609
01:28:14,459 --> 01:28:16,154
Joycey:
It's one of them, isn't it?

1610
01:28:16,194 --> 01:28:17,559
It's the anticipation.

1611
01:28:17,595 --> 01:28:19,358
I don't know if I can
go through with it.

1612
01:28:19,397 --> 01:28:20,796
Here we go.

1613
01:28:23,735 --> 01:28:25,498
( bell rings )

1614
01:28:25,537 --> 01:28:27,801
Fucking stop it!

1615
01:28:27,839 --> 01:28:29,864
That got you going.

1616
01:28:32,644 --> 01:28:34,202
Dainton:
But he didn't take the money!

1617
01:28:34,245 --> 01:28:36,975
- He didn't get the money!
- It's impossible. Fuck off!

1618
01:28:37,015 --> 01:28:40,815
- That's mine!
- Your turn, Daint. What you having?

1619
01:28:40,852 --> 01:28:43,013
I've got a wicked plan up
my sleeve for you, Daint.

1620
01:28:43,054 --> 01:28:46,046
We get loads of money--
basically, on the bottom

1621
01:28:46,090 --> 01:28:48,183
there's gonna be
loads of pins-- drawing pins--

1622
01:28:48,226 --> 01:28:50,217
and we're gonna put
the money on top of it.

1623
01:28:50,261 --> 01:28:51,660
You've gotta
put your hand on it,

1624
01:28:51,696 --> 01:28:53,095
and we're gonna smash
your hand down,

1625
01:28:53,131 --> 01:28:54,723
and you've gotta get
your money that way.

1626
01:28:54,766 --> 01:28:57,792
What-- what about forehead?
Do it on the forehead again?

1627
01:28:57,835 --> 01:28:58,859
- Forehead?
- Yeah.

1628
01:28:58,903 --> 01:29:02,339
- Fuck right off!
- Three, two, one.

1629
01:29:05,910 --> 01:29:08,242
Fucking hell!

1630
01:29:08,279 --> 01:29:10,543
Oh my God,
look at that!

1631
01:29:10,582 --> 01:29:13,073
That's fucking graphic!

1632
01:29:13,117 --> 01:29:15,108
- Get a photo of that, man.
- Oh, Daint.

1633
01:29:15,153 --> 01:29:17,144
Fucking hell,
it's pulling out...

1634
01:29:22,293 --> 01:29:25,353
I'm willing to gamble
1,000 of this back

1635
01:29:25,396 --> 01:29:27,694
for you to take
a gob in the mouth.

1636
01:29:27,732 --> 01:29:29,996
- Oh, Daint.
- A gob in the mouth?

1637
01:29:30,034 --> 01:29:32,127
- No, it's fucking rank.
- Dainton: Come on.

1638
01:29:32,170 --> 01:29:34,035
- What do you mean?
- Spit in his mouth. He don't like spit.

1639
01:29:34,072 --> 01:29:36,506
He's got a phobia of spit.
Would you rather get run over by a car

1640
01:29:36,541 --> 01:29:39,271
- or someone spit in your mouth?
- Run over by a car.

1641
01:29:39,310 --> 01:29:41,437
( hawks )

1642
01:29:41,479 --> 01:29:43,106
Right, ready?

1643
01:29:45,617 --> 01:29:47,175
All in his mouth!

1644
01:29:49,988 --> 01:29:53,082
- He looks so green!
- ( gags )

1645
01:29:56,828 --> 01:30:00,025
- Man overboard!
- Quick, set the sails. Let's fuck off!

1646
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:04,664
We're backstage in, er,

1647
01:30:04,702 --> 01:30:06,670
The Voodoo Lounge
in the Dominican Republic

1648
01:30:06,704 --> 01:30:09,502
about to do a pain auction.
Pain equals money.

1649
01:30:09,540 --> 01:30:12,168
What do we like? Money.
What does it equal? Greed.

1650
01:30:12,210 --> 01:30:14,371
Are you guys ready

1651
01:30:14,412 --> 01:30:16,880
- for some fun tonight?
- ( cheering )

1652
01:30:16,914 --> 01:30:18,848
Come on!

1653
01:30:18,883 --> 01:30:21,909
Okay, we've got
lot number one.

1654
01:30:21,953 --> 01:30:23,443
This is
the fishing rod ear.

1655
01:30:23,488 --> 01:30:26,548
Stick it in there!

1656
01:30:26,591 --> 01:30:30,083
So do we have anyone who wants
to pay some money for that?

1657
01:30:30,128 --> 01:30:33,461
- ( man yells )
- I have a lady there.

1658
01:30:33,498 --> 01:30:36,797
Lady with the big tits.
Whoa, sold for 150.

1659
01:30:36,834 --> 01:30:40,827
- Go! Come on!
- ( yells )

1660
01:30:44,175 --> 01:30:45,938
Come on, pull it!

1661
01:30:45,977 --> 01:30:47,842
Pull!

1662
01:30:50,114 --> 01:30:52,014
Joycey:
Who wants to start the bid off?

1663
01:30:52,050 --> 01:30:54,245
100 to see Panch get smashed
on the head with some pots.

1664
01:30:54,285 --> 01:30:56,185
Can we have 60? 80!

1665
01:30:56,220 --> 01:30:57,949
Shoeshine boy, 90!

1666
01:30:57,989 --> 01:31:00,617
All:
Five, four, three,

1667
01:31:00,658 --> 01:31:03,491
two, one. Go!

1668
01:31:06,264 --> 01:31:09,097
That sex pest over there,
number five. Yes, 50.

1669
01:31:09,133 --> 01:31:11,567
( grunts )

1670
01:31:12,804 --> 01:31:15,671
Dainton, voodoo therapy,
stick it in there!

1671
01:31:18,643 --> 01:31:21,806
Whoa!
( yelling )

1672
01:31:25,049 --> 01:31:28,314
For 30. Can I see
that 30? Yes.

1673
01:31:28,352 --> 01:31:30,286
All:
Five, four, three,

1674
01:31:30,321 --> 01:31:32,516
two, one!

1675
01:31:34,292 --> 01:31:37,386
- He's in fucking agony.
- It fucking kills!

1676
01:31:37,428 --> 01:31:40,022
Get it out!
It's fucking killing, you prick!

1677
01:31:40,064 --> 01:31:43,227
Ah! Ah!
No no no!

1678
01:31:43,267 --> 01:31:46,532
Stop it!
Fuck the cameras!

1679
01:31:46,571 --> 01:31:48,596
Get it fucking out.

1680
01:31:50,775 --> 01:31:53,767
( all chant )
Pancho, Pancho, Pancho, Pancho.

1681
01:31:53,811 --> 01:31:56,041
Closed.
Sold for 150.

1682
01:32:23,617 --> 01:32:25,983
Dainton:
Let's get fucking bollixed!

1683
01:32:27,020 --> 01:32:28,544
Ladies and gentlemen,

1684
01:32:28,588 --> 01:32:30,920
you've been watching
"Dirty Sanchez - Live"!

1685
01:32:30,957 --> 01:32:32,857
Make some noise!

1686
01:32:34,494 --> 01:32:36,519
- ( rewinding )
- ( all screaming )

1687
01:32:37,964 --> 01:32:40,057
The Devil:
Boys, boys, boys...

1688
01:32:40,100 --> 01:32:43,160
that was really
some performance out there.

1689
01:32:43,203 --> 01:32:47,230
Tattooed penises,
dismemberment,

1690
01:32:47,274 --> 01:32:48,798
cannibalism--

1691
01:32:48,842 --> 01:32:51,504
you boys
really blaze a trail.

1692
01:32:51,545 --> 01:32:53,945
Do you have anything
to say for yourselves?

1693
01:32:53,980 --> 01:32:56,744
I have got
something to admit.

1694
01:32:56,783 --> 01:32:59,115
Pancho hasn't got
any eyebrows left.

1695
01:32:59,152 --> 01:33:00,710
No, that ain't -- fuck.

1696
01:33:00,754 --> 01:33:03,985
- Better fucking not be.
- Gone.

1697
01:33:04,024 --> 01:33:07,516
Guys, knock
the fuck out now.

1698
01:33:08,528 --> 01:33:09,688
No, it is, isn't it?

1699
01:33:09,729 --> 01:33:11,196
I need a fucking wash.

1700
01:33:11,231 --> 01:33:12,892
Fuck it!

1701
01:33:15,068 --> 01:33:17,298
He obviously doesn't
want his life back.

1702
01:33:19,406 --> 01:33:21,704
I'm fucking serious, man.
That's fucking it.

1703
01:33:22,542 --> 01:33:24,510
Get that fucking thing
out of my face!

1704
01:33:24,544 --> 01:33:27,570
I'm fucking telling you--
fuck off!

1705
01:33:27,614 --> 01:33:29,980
- No no no no.
- Right!

1706
01:33:30,016 --> 01:33:32,712
The makeup people,
well, we told them,

1707
01:33:32,752 --> 01:33:34,720
"Tell Pancho his eyebrows
need sorting out."

1708
01:33:34,754 --> 01:33:36,847
And we put lmmac
on his eyebrows,

1709
01:33:36,890 --> 01:33:38,755
so his eyebrows
are falling out.

1710
01:33:38,792 --> 01:33:40,487
Right, gone.

1711
01:33:40,527 --> 01:33:42,586
You're fucking
happy now, are you?

1712
01:33:42,629 --> 01:33:44,324
He's probably got
all those wigs,

1713
01:33:44,364 --> 01:33:46,332
and he's trying to superglue
some eyebrows back on.

1714
01:33:46,366 --> 01:33:48,857
I'm likely to go and fucking
stab someone now.

1715
01:33:48,902 --> 01:33:50,665
Look at it.
I'm fucking telling you.

1716
01:33:50,704 --> 01:33:52,228
Cameraman:
No, don't do that.

1717
01:33:52,272 --> 01:33:54,604
Fucking always
at my fucking expense, right?

1718
01:33:54,641 --> 01:33:56,871
Oh, fuck,
we've pushed it this time.

1719
01:33:56,910 --> 01:33:58,639
What did he say all the way
through the movie?

1720
01:33:58,678 --> 01:34:00,509
( mimics )
"Do not fuck with my eyebrows!"

1721
01:34:00,547 --> 01:34:02,538
Cameraman:
Panch, stick around.

1722
01:34:03,984 --> 01:34:05,849
Get the fuck away
from me.

1723
01:34:05,885 --> 01:34:07,910
( cameraman speaking )

1724
01:34:13,727 --> 01:34:15,285
Go on, Panch!

1725
01:34:23,670 --> 01:34:25,365
Here comes the trouble.

1726
01:34:27,707 --> 01:34:29,231
Hello.

1727
01:34:30,243 --> 01:34:33,337
"I love Dainton"? No!

1728
01:34:33,380 --> 01:34:35,974
No. No way.
Is that real?

1729
01:34:36,016 --> 01:34:38,314
Yeah. I went through
absolute agony.

1730
01:34:38,351 --> 01:34:40,148
I'm not sitting
on that ever again.

1731
01:34:40,186 --> 01:34:42,620
Oh, Lis, I haven't had sex
for four weeks.

1732
01:34:42,656 --> 01:34:44,954
Never again.
No way. I don't care.

1733
01:34:44,991 --> 01:34:47,551
I'm not putting Dainton
in my mouth. No way.

1734
01:34:55,135 --> 01:34:56,727
Come on, fucking get
out the way!

1735
01:34:56,770 --> 01:34:59,136
Look at that bubble!
Look at that snot bubble!

1736
01:35:01,241 --> 01:35:03,937
Am I green
in the face?

1737
01:35:03,977 --> 01:35:06,070
- ( guys laughing )
- I am?

1738
01:35:06,112 --> 01:35:08,080
I've brought you
to this spa

1739
01:35:08,114 --> 01:35:10,947
for the ultimate
sports massage.

1740
01:35:10,984 --> 01:35:12,747
Well, it better
be proper special,

1741
01:35:12,786 --> 01:35:16,017
because I've got these
absolutely poxy pants.

1742
01:35:16,056 --> 01:35:18,354
( yelling )

1743
01:35:18,391 --> 01:35:20,256
Pritchard:
Rock and roll!

1744
01:35:21,895 --> 01:35:23,658
Yes. He's done it!

1745
01:35:26,299 --> 01:35:27,960
Fuck me, man!

1746
01:35:28,001 --> 01:35:29,764
It's the only way
to warm up.

1747
01:35:29,803 --> 01:35:32,465
Guess-- guess what
that little bad boy is.

1748
01:35:32,505 --> 01:35:35,030
That-- that's --
that's frozen shit.

1749
01:35:37,410 --> 01:35:40,868
Oh, hello. A little penguin,
little frozen penguin.

1750
01:35:44,250 --> 01:35:46,878
It still stinks!
I didn't think it would smell.

1751
01:35:50,457 --> 01:35:53,255
Get off,
get off, get off!

1752
01:36:00,333 --> 01:36:02,358
That's Joycey's frozen--

1753
01:36:02,402 --> 01:36:04,131
oh, it's on my lens. Oh!

1754
01:36:04,170 --> 01:36:06,604
There's dots and there's
a lump of poop.

1755
01:36:06,639 --> 01:36:08,334
( all yell )

1756
01:36:08,375 --> 01:36:10,570
Pritch, you know
that tattoo on your leg?

1757
01:36:10,610 --> 01:36:13,010
"Sleep when you're dead"
in Russian, guys. Whoo!

1758
01:36:13,046 --> 01:36:15,446
- Daint, fuck off!
- It doesn't even say--

1759
01:36:15,482 --> 01:36:17,074
it doesn't even say
"Sleep when you're dead."

1760
01:36:17,117 --> 01:36:20,280
- What does it say now?
- "I love Johnny Knoxville."

1761
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:22,982
( laughing )
