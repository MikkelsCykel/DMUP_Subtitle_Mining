0
00:03:59,647 --> 00:04:01,638
What does "broccoli" mean?

1
00:04:01,816 --> 00:04:06,185
Depends on the context.
Pubic hair or marijuana. It's a noun.

2
00:04:06,354 --> 00:04:08,515
And "Virginia"?

3
00:04:08,689 --> 00:04:13,092
Vagina. As in, "He penetrated
her Virginia with a hammer."

4
00:04:13,261 --> 00:04:16,526
-Yikes!
-Slang is either sexual or violent.

5
00:04:16,697 --> 00:04:17,925
Or both.

6
00:04:18,099 --> 00:04:20,693
When it's witty,
I think it's really witty.

7
00:04:21,702 --> 00:04:23,192
Yeah.

8
00:04:23,371 --> 00:04:24,929
Hello, how are you?

9
00:04:25,106 --> 00:04:26,937
How are you?

10
00:04:27,108 --> 00:04:29,042
Hi, how are you?

11
00:04:31,779 --> 00:04:33,872
Why didn't you say hi?

12
00:04:34,715 --> 00:04:36,615
I nodded.

13
00:04:38,052 --> 00:04:40,452
Are you happy when you wake up?

14
00:04:40,621 --> 00:04:42,282
No.

15
00:04:44,392 --> 00:04:47,293
Hey, there was a petal storm
out here this morning.

16
00:04:47,461 --> 00:04:49,292
I saw that.

17
00:04:49,463 --> 00:04:51,954
I thought it was a snowstorm.

18
00:04:52,133 --> 00:04:54,397
I thought I was dreaming.

19
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:12,752
No, there's two stores
we should go to in Soho.

20
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:19,023
It would not take very much for me
to make you look very good.

21
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:22,094
You're sabotaging
a fucking incredible figure, baby.

22
00:05:22,263 --> 00:05:24,197
Yo!

23
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:27,698
Is that your student?
It looks like he wants to eat you.

24
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:30,133
They all flirt. It's part of the ritual.

25
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:32,236
-Miss Avery, you're late.
-Am I?

26
00:05:32,406 --> 00:05:34,966
-What, you trying to be ironic?
-Hello.

27
00:05:35,142 --> 00:05:37,133
-What's happening?
-I'm Pauline.

28
00:05:39,046 --> 00:05:40,980
We talked this morning
on the phone.

29
00:05:41,148 --> 00:05:45,278
-Yeah.
-You look different than I thought.

30
00:05:46,921 --> 00:05:49,719
Thank you for sharing your bed.

31
00:05:49,924 --> 00:05:51,152
Bye.

32
00:05:51,325 --> 00:05:53,054
Bye.

33
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:27,360
I got a new word for you.

34
00:06:27,528 --> 00:06:29,257
"Meow."

35
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:31,754
Is this your usual?

36
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,901
Are you gonna write that down?

37
00:06:34,201 --> 00:06:35,862
You should be paying me for this.

38
00:06:36,037 --> 00:06:37,595
-You think so?
-Yeah.

39
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:40,206
This is valuable shit.

40
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:47,179
Aren't you afraid your book on slang
is like a dis?

41
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:48,676
A dis on whom?

42
00:06:50,384 --> 00:06:53,080
People like you think the brothers
are guinea pigs...

43
00:06:53,254 --> 00:06:54,721
...the way we talk and shit.

44
00:06:54,889 --> 00:06:58,518
Cornelius, are you trying to tell me
that you need an extension?

45
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:05,364
No. Look, I came to tell you
I made a discovery.

46
00:07:05,733 --> 00:07:10,170
See, I discovered I can call
John Wayne Gacy...

47
00:07:10,338 --> 00:07:12,499
...and hear him talk himself,
Miss Avery.

48
00:07:12,673 --> 00:07:15,164
Really? Dead murderers have
their own phone lines?

49
00:07:15,343 --> 00:07:17,072
He wasn't no murderer.

50
00:07:17,244 --> 00:07:19,678
Look, there be a website
for serial killers...

51
00:07:19,847 --> 00:07:21,508
...you know, past and present.

52
00:07:21,682 --> 00:07:23,912
He recorded and explained
himself...

53
00:07:24,085 --> 00:07:26,918
...how he didn't kill no 33 boys.

54
00:07:27,088 --> 00:07:28,749
I got radar for the truth...

55
00:07:28,923 --> 00:07:31,357
...and I'm gonna write
how I know that.

56
00:07:31,525 --> 00:07:33,959
This paper's not supposed
to be about you.

57
00:07:34,128 --> 00:07:37,996
-That's the point of the assignment.
-You said every word a writer writes...

58
00:07:38,165 --> 00:07:41,430
...even the commas and shit,
gotta be a reflection of him or her.

59
00:07:41,869 --> 00:07:45,430
That we be doing this writing shit
to express our vision.

60
00:07:46,273 --> 00:07:48,207
You know I got vision.

61
00:07:48,376 --> 00:07:50,742
You know, I got Africa vision.

62
00:07:51,779 --> 00:07:54,179
You know, I got bitch vision.

63
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:55,940
I got....

64
00:07:56,117 --> 00:07:58,551
Yeah. Excuse me, I have to go
to the bathroom.

65
00:09:49,597 --> 00:09:53,363
Come on, you guys, you were
supposed to wait for me.

66
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:18,621
Hey, miss.

67
00:10:18,792 --> 00:10:20,885
Hey, miss. Hey!

68
00:10:21,061 --> 00:10:23,052
You forgot something.

69
00:10:23,531 --> 00:10:24,520
The check.

70
00:10:31,205 --> 00:10:34,538
<i>Stream of consciousness,</i>
<i>I'd like to point out, is not the same...</i>

71
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:36,175
...as stream of conscience...

72
00:10:36,343 --> 00:10:39,073
...for which some of you
have mistaken it.

73
00:10:40,648 --> 00:10:43,583
A logical error in some ways.

74
00:10:49,924 --> 00:10:53,621
Okay, your assignment for today
is to utilize...

75
00:10:53,794 --> 00:10:56,786
-Nothing happens.
-...style in <i>To the Lighthouse</i>.

76
00:10:56,964 --> 00:10:58,329
Yeah, one old lady dies.

77
00:10:58,499 --> 00:11:00,694
How many ladies have to die
to make it good?

78
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:03,029
At least three.

79
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:14,203
-What's this?
-From the bar...

80
00:11:14,381 --> 00:11:16,372
...my half of the check.

81
00:11:16,951 --> 00:11:19,613
Yo, man, where you go?
I waited a long time.

82
00:11:19,787 --> 00:11:22,722
-Couldn't find the bathroom.
-Is that all?

83
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:27,086
-Is what all?
-All I owe you.

84
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:34,223
I can't pass you
unless you show up to class.

85
00:11:49,483 --> 00:11:52,646
<i>The still waters of the water</i>
<i>under a frond of stars</i>

86
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:56,756
<i>The still water of your mouth</i>
<i>under a thicket of kisses</i>

87
00:12:11,038 --> 00:12:14,201
<i>The still waters of the water</i>
<i>under a frond of stars</i>

88
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:18,607
<i>The still water of your mouth</i>
<i>under a thicket of kisses</i>

89
00:12:25,252 --> 00:12:27,846
<i>Under a thicket of kisses</i>

90
00:12:46,407 --> 00:12:49,467
-How you doing?
-Do I know you?

91
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,901
Detective Malloy.

92
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,842
Are you Francis Avery?

93
00:12:54,581 --> 00:12:58,073
I'm canvassing your apartment
building. I wanna talk to you.

94
00:12:59,486 --> 00:13:01,147
How do I know that's real?

95
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,419
It's still busy.
Why don't you come back.

96
00:13:08,595 --> 00:13:10,756
I'll wait, thanks.

97
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:31,048
Can I smoke?

98
00:13:32,219 --> 00:13:33,709
Not in my apartment.

99
00:13:33,887 --> 00:13:36,720
You got someplace
I could put it out?

100
00:13:43,464 --> 00:13:45,056
Thanks.

101
00:13:47,634 --> 00:13:52,571
Miss Avery, there was a homicide
in your neighborhood on the 15th.

102
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,766
That'd be Saturday the 15th,
last Saturday...

103
00:13:55,943 --> 00:13:58,503
...between 12 and 2 a.m.

104
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:00,943
Her body, or part of her body,
to be exact...

105
00:14:01,115 --> 00:14:04,141
...was found in the garden
outside your window.

106
00:14:07,187 --> 00:14:11,180
That's why I wanted to talk to you,
in case you saw or heard anything.

107
00:14:11,358 --> 00:14:14,054
No. No, nothing unusual.

108
00:14:15,929 --> 00:14:18,420
<i>Frannie, it's John Graham.</i>
<i>Are you by yourself?</i>

109
00:14:18,599 --> 00:14:20,590
<i>I don't think you're there</i>
<i>by yourself.</i>

110
00:14:20,768 --> 00:14:22,258
<i>Why did you lie to me?</i>

111
00:14:22,436 --> 00:14:25,496
<i>Doesn't it mean anything to you</i>
<i>that we slept together twice?</i>

112
00:14:25,672 --> 00:14:28,402
<i>Yes, I do count that time</i>
<i>in the shower. Quiet!</i>

113
00:14:28,575 --> 00:14:30,406
<i>Come on, pick up the phone.</i>

114
00:14:31,378 --> 00:14:32,777
<i>Pick up.</i>

115
00:14:32,946 --> 00:14:34,379
<i>Pick up. Pick up.</i>

116
00:14:34,548 --> 00:14:38,040
<i>Pick up. Come on,</i>
<i>pick up the phone.</i>

117
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:04,772
Are you a writer?

118
00:15:08,081 --> 00:15:10,015
What's all this?

119
00:15:10,184 --> 00:15:13,745
Words, quotes that I like, poetry.

120
00:15:13,921 --> 00:15:17,015
Is it, like, a job or a hobby?

121
00:15:17,191 --> 00:15:19,182
A passion.

122
00:15:22,529 --> 00:15:26,363
"I want to do with you what spring
does with the cherry trees."

123
00:15:38,779 --> 00:15:40,610
Is this you?

124
00:15:46,386 --> 00:15:47,751
It's my sister.

125
00:15:49,556 --> 00:15:52,889
My ex-wife had long hair,
then she cut it.

126
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:57,156
So you don't remember
seeing anything?

127
00:15:58,398 --> 00:15:59,865
Hearing anything?

128
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:06,063
Oh, my pen?
It's fake. It's a cop thing.

129
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,903
You don't remember anything? Didn't
see anything? Didn't hear anything?

130
00:16:10,077 --> 00:16:11,408
No cries in the night?

131
00:16:11,578 --> 00:16:16,845
No. I don't remember seeing
or hearing anything unusual.

132
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:19,918
-And I sleep with the windows open.
-Yeah?

133
00:16:20,087 --> 00:16:22,078
You do that a lot?

134
00:16:24,258 --> 00:16:26,590
Can you tell me how it happened?

135
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:29,261
Her throat was cut.

136
00:16:29,429 --> 00:16:31,795
And then she was disarticulated.

137
00:16:34,701 --> 00:16:36,362
Here's my card.

138
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:40,598
My number's there. If you remember
anything, give me a call, all right?

139
00:16:42,709 --> 00:16:44,700
Do I know you from someplace?

140
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:46,470
I don't know.

141
00:16:49,449 --> 00:16:50,882
Thanks.

142
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:53,034
Oh, shit.

143
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,890
-Don't bullshit me. Look me in the eye.
-I'm not.

144
00:19:16,229 --> 00:19:19,630
Now, you think about it, all right?
Now, take a walk. Miss?

145
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,394
Oh, miss? Miss?

146
00:19:22,569 --> 00:19:24,560
How you doing? Excuse me.

147
00:19:24,905 --> 00:19:27,237
Can I talk to you for a minute?

148
00:19:30,243 --> 00:19:32,177
Am I supposed to get in?

149
00:19:32,345 --> 00:19:34,176
You want to talk on the street?

150
00:19:34,347 --> 00:19:38,579
Never think it's a good idea, putting
your business on the street.

151
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,748
I'll get it.

152
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:53,123
This is my partner,
Detective Rodriguez.

153
00:19:53,433 --> 00:19:55,594
Hi. How you doing?

154
00:19:56,203 --> 00:19:58,137
-How do you do?
-What the fuck is this?

155
00:19:58,305 --> 00:19:59,829
-It's coffee.
-It's half a cup.

156
00:20:00,006 --> 00:20:02,201
-Take it back.
-He gives me a half a cup.

157
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:04,809
What, does he expect you to fill--?

158
00:20:04,978 --> 00:20:06,878
How long is this gonna take?

159
00:20:07,047 --> 00:20:09,072
-I'm sorry?
-How long is this gonna take?

160
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:11,945
-Are you in a hurry?
-Where you going?

161
00:20:12,719 --> 00:20:16,780
-My friend's. Half sister's.
-We'll give you a lift.

162
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:20,790
-So, what do you do?
-I teach.

163
00:20:20,961 --> 00:20:23,953
-You teach what?
-You get a chance to run those prints?

164
00:20:24,131 --> 00:20:26,599
-Teach what?
-English.

165
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,291
You know what an isthmus is?

166
00:20:28,468 --> 00:20:30,766
Isthmus be my lucky fucking day.

167
00:20:30,937 --> 00:20:33,030
-What the fuck? You ran the prints?
-Yeah.

168
00:20:33,206 --> 00:20:34,867
-And?
-<i>Nada,</i> nothing.

169
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:38,135
Look, the reason we thought
you might be able to help...

170
00:20:38,311 --> 00:20:41,178
...is the bartender....
Luther Wilker?

171
00:20:41,414 --> 00:20:42,745
-Yeah.
-At the Red....

172
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:44,178
-Turtle.
-Well, he said...

173
00:20:44,351 --> 00:20:46,785
...you were there
on the night in question.

174
00:20:46,953 --> 00:20:50,912
-He's got a good memory.
-No, we have your credit-card receipt.

175
00:20:51,591 --> 00:20:53,559
Does that look familiar?

176
00:20:55,328 --> 00:20:56,659
That's right.

177
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:59,822
I was at the Red Turtle
with one of my students.

178
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,366
-One of your students?
-Cornelius Webb.

179
00:21:02,536 --> 00:21:05,699
But it was early. It was 3:30.

180
00:21:08,542 --> 00:21:10,874
I was there for a short time,
then I went home.

181
00:21:11,044 --> 00:21:12,409
Cornelius Webb?

182
00:21:12,579 --> 00:21:16,037
Is that with two B's or not two B's?

183
00:21:18,385 --> 00:21:19,909
W-E-B-B.

184
00:21:20,287 --> 00:21:22,448
You were in the front room
the whole time?

185
00:21:22,622 --> 00:21:25,147
-Yes.
-Are you sure?

186
00:21:25,959 --> 00:21:27,483
Didn't I just say so?

187
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:32,693
You didn't happen to see
a Caucasian girl, mid-20s?

188
00:21:32,866 --> 00:21:36,700
Not too tall.
Good-looking, wouldn't you say?

189
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:38,565
-What?
-She was good-looking?

190
00:21:38,738 --> 00:21:41,138
-She wasn't bad-looking.
-Yeah, but she....

191
00:21:41,308 --> 00:21:42,673
Well, did you?

192
00:21:43,643 --> 00:21:46,305
-What is this about, exactly?
-Listen, Miss Avery...

193
00:21:46,479 --> 00:21:50,415
...the deceased was seen in the Red
Turtle the same night you were there.

194
00:21:51,418 --> 00:21:53,147
Seeing how you were there...

195
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:56,812
...maybe you wouldn't mind
taking a look at a few pictures.

196
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:59,356
Sometimes you see something
you don't remember.

197
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:02,586
Take a deep breath.
This one's kind of graphic.

198
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:21,874
Well, do you recognize her?

199
00:22:24,451 --> 00:22:26,043
No.

200
00:22:51,344 --> 00:22:53,744
Thank you.

201
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:59,310
Hey. Can't figure you out.

202
00:22:59,486 --> 00:23:02,284
What do you mean?
Am I a murder suspect?

203
00:23:02,455 --> 00:23:05,913
Look, I was wondering if you want
to go for a beer or something.

204
00:23:06,092 --> 00:23:08,925
I got a cousin who works in a bar
in Sheridan Square...

205
00:23:09,095 --> 00:23:12,155
-...and says a lot of writers go in there.
-Now?

206
00:23:12,332 --> 00:23:15,028
No, not now. I'm working now.

207
00:23:15,302 --> 00:23:16,701
-Two hours from now.
-Where?

208
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:18,531
Here.

209
00:23:19,506 --> 00:23:21,440
What the fuck?

210
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:32,615
You're a fucking wise guy?

211
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:40,890
We got nice girls and nicer drinks.

212
00:23:41,061 --> 00:23:43,222
Oh, excuse me, baby.

213
00:23:43,396 --> 00:23:44,886
-Hey, Papi.
-Hey.

214
00:23:45,065 --> 00:23:47,898
-Good to see you. Look at you.
-You are looking good.

215
00:23:48,068 --> 00:23:50,002
Is Pauline home?

216
00:23:50,537 --> 00:23:52,402
-Sorry.
-Oh, baby.

217
00:23:52,572 --> 00:23:54,301
She could be up.
She could be down.

218
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:59,741
You know, go check the bar, baby,
okay? Hey, hey, hey, look.

219
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:04,010
That's cute. Is it real?

220
00:24:04,184 --> 00:24:06,175
Of course it be real.
What, you crazy?

221
00:24:06,353 --> 00:24:08,821
I don't let no psycho killer mess
with my girls.

222
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:11,480
He'd be dead. Bye, baby.

223
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:15,025
I make sure no one fuck
with my goddamn girls.

224
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:19,259
What is it?

225
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,994
What's wrong?

226
00:24:22,702 --> 00:24:25,364
It's so humiliating.

227
00:24:26,439 --> 00:24:28,600
Is it the doctor?

228
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:42,120
Do you want to go up?

229
00:24:42,622 --> 00:24:44,556
Okay.

230
00:24:44,724 --> 00:24:46,419
Thanks, guys.

231
00:24:46,593 --> 00:24:49,289
-Good luck.
-Feel better.

232
00:24:51,731 --> 00:24:54,291
-What happened?
-His receptionist called me...

233
00:24:54,467 --> 00:24:57,732
...with a referral
to another doctor.

234
00:24:57,904 --> 00:25:00,873
He canceled our appointment.

235
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:03,066
-Was this after you had sex?
-He's right.

236
00:25:03,243 --> 00:25:08,237
He shouldn't have had sex with me.
I mean, of course he's right.

237
00:25:18,425 --> 00:25:21,622
Do you ever think about
just imagining sex?

238
00:25:22,529 --> 00:25:25,191
-What do you mean?
-Just thinking about the doctor...

239
00:25:25,365 --> 00:25:28,061
...not making appointments.
Just....

240
00:25:28,868 --> 00:25:31,928
Just not really trying to have sex
with him in reality.

241
00:25:32,105 --> 00:25:33,629
That's kind of boring.

242
00:25:35,375 --> 00:25:38,208
I mean, I do. I do restrain myself.

243
00:25:38,378 --> 00:25:42,041
You know, I just--
I got so enthusiastic...

244
00:25:42,215 --> 00:25:44,706
...when I thought about him,
and it confused me...

245
00:25:44,884 --> 00:25:47,717
...because I think enthusiasm
is a good thing, you know.

246
00:25:47,887 --> 00:25:50,321
I mean, I think about....

247
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:55,088
How many appointments
did you make?

248
00:25:55,261 --> 00:25:57,286
Last week?

249
00:26:01,901 --> 00:26:03,698
Eleven.

250
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,901
How about I put on some music?

251
00:26:23,523 --> 00:26:27,015
I waited outside his apartment.

252
00:26:27,327 --> 00:26:30,194
I saw him and his wife...

253
00:26:30,363 --> 00:26:32,729
...and I followed her
to the dry cleaner.

254
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:38,699
She left a tan suit.

255
00:26:39,272 --> 00:26:41,502
Did you pick it up?

256
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:03,657
-What are you gonna do with it?
-I don't know.

257
00:27:04,297 --> 00:27:05,559
I feel like such a freak.

258
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:08,729
This is what I do to get a dick
inside me.

259
00:27:08,902 --> 00:27:10,699
You're not a freak.

260
00:27:11,571 --> 00:27:13,562
I admire you.

261
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,401
You live out of your unconscious.

262
00:27:16,976 --> 00:27:18,739
You're a poet of love.

263
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:21,881
<i>The lovelorn man who</i>

264
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:26,508
<i>Sick in soul and of this</i>
<i>Busy human heart aweary</i>

265
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:30,087
<i>Worships the spirit</i>
<i>Of unconscious life</i>

266
00:27:30,256 --> 00:27:35,421
<i>In tree or wildflower</i>
<i>Gentle lunatic</i>

267
00:27:35,595 --> 00:27:39,588
"Gentle lunatic." That's me.

268
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:04,212
I have something for you.

269
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:06,722
It's like a belated birthday thing.

270
00:28:06,926 --> 00:28:10,987
I got it when I was styling that
commercial that got canceled.

271
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:24,566
Oh, God, that's beautiful.

272
00:28:26,012 --> 00:28:28,913
-What is it?
-It's a courtship fantasy.

273
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:32,916
See, there's a little wedding bell
and a little house.

274
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:35,111
Open the baby carriage.

275
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:39,016
Oh, God.

276
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:42,918
Oh, no, am I gonna have
to feed this thing?

277
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:45,462
You should have a baby.

278
00:28:46,499 --> 00:28:48,433
This is the closest I'll get.

279
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:51,263
And a man. You should have
a man too.

280
00:28:56,376 --> 00:28:57,843
Somebody asked me out.

281
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:01,436
Good.

282
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:03,479
Who?

283
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:05,481
A police detective.

284
00:29:05,652 --> 00:29:09,110
He's investigating a girl's murder.
You know the one who got cut up?

285
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:10,620
Oh, my God. Yeah.

286
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,781
Part of her body was found
in my garden.

287
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:14,893
Yuck.

288
00:29:15,061 --> 00:29:17,996
So is this detective good-looking?

289
00:29:19,899 --> 00:29:23,062
He seems young.
He's got a mustache.

290
00:29:24,404 --> 00:29:26,338
They've all got that.

291
00:29:27,573 --> 00:29:29,302
You didn't say no, Frannie?

292
00:29:30,176 --> 00:29:32,144
Frannie?

293
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:37,045
You gotta go. Just for the exercise,
you should go.

294
00:29:40,853 --> 00:29:43,083
You wanna borrow
some decent clothing?

295
00:29:43,256 --> 00:29:44,917
-Can we look?
-I think you should.

296
00:29:45,091 --> 00:29:47,685
Can you come with me?
Come on.

297
00:30:35,141 --> 00:30:38,474
Get the woman a gin and tonic,
and I'll have a bourbon and Coke.

298
00:30:38,644 --> 00:30:40,077
You got it.

299
00:30:40,246 --> 00:30:44,239
You know, I'm wondering if maybe
you saw something at that bar.

300
00:30:44,417 --> 00:30:46,385
I'm still wondering.

301
00:30:46,552 --> 00:30:48,816
Maybe something
you don't know you saw.

302
00:30:49,989 --> 00:30:53,083
Your colored boyfriend,
did he leave with you?

303
00:30:54,927 --> 00:30:57,623
Cornelius? He's not my boyfriend.

304
00:30:59,098 --> 00:31:00,588
And he left before me.

305
00:31:00,767 --> 00:31:02,826
You saw him leave?

306
00:31:03,202 --> 00:31:04,931
Actually, no.

307
00:31:07,607 --> 00:31:11,600
He's not into popping arms off
of ladies' bodies, is he?

308
00:31:11,778 --> 00:31:14,611
Not that I know about.

309
00:31:20,052 --> 00:31:22,043
What, my hands?

310
00:31:22,555 --> 00:31:25,023
Well, yeah, I know,
I got faggot hands.

311
00:31:25,625 --> 00:31:27,616
They're soft.

312
00:31:29,028 --> 00:31:31,326
Actually, I was wondering
about your tattoo.

313
00:31:31,497 --> 00:31:33,294
Oh, that?

314
00:31:36,402 --> 00:31:38,734
I'm in a secret club.

315
00:31:39,071 --> 00:31:41,198
Are there many members?

316
00:31:44,977 --> 00:31:46,877
Hey, listen...

317
00:31:47,413 --> 00:31:50,075
...I can be whatever
you want me to be.

318
00:31:51,751 --> 00:31:55,585
You want me to romance you, take you
to a classy restaurant, no problem.

319
00:31:55,755 --> 00:32:00,658
You want me to be your best friend
and fuck you...

320
00:32:00,993 --> 00:32:04,451
...treat you good, lick your pussy...

321
00:32:04,931 --> 00:32:06,865
...no problem.

322
00:32:07,433 --> 00:32:09,867
Ain't much I haven't done.

323
00:32:10,036 --> 00:32:13,028
The only thing I won't do
is beat you up.

324
00:32:20,947 --> 00:32:24,041
Why does your partner
carry a water pistol?

325
00:32:28,855 --> 00:32:31,881
-They took his gun away.
-Why did they take his gun away?

326
00:32:32,058 --> 00:32:33,958
Because...

327
00:32:34,894 --> 00:32:37,362
...his wife caught him
fucking a fat chick.

328
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:40,632
When she found out
she ran upstairs and tosses...

329
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,132
...his Hispanic Society trophy
out the window.

330
00:32:43,302 --> 00:32:46,601
And you know, that's pretty much
when he tried to kill her.

331
00:32:46,772 --> 00:32:51,232
That's a good reason to kill your wife,
of all the reasons that I can think of.

332
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:53,640
He wasn't gonna kill her, lady.

333
00:32:53,813 --> 00:32:56,509
He was just trying to scare her.

334
00:32:58,184 --> 00:33:01,051
That was his San Juan
Man of the Year Award, you know?

335
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,983
Ritchie takes that stuff seriously.

336
00:33:03,155 --> 00:33:06,215
So those fat-fucking-fucks from IA,
they got ahold of him...

337
00:33:06,392 --> 00:33:08,417
...they take his gun,
take his badge...

338
00:33:08,594 --> 00:33:11,620
...they put him on modified duty
and now he's a house mouse.

339
00:33:11,797 --> 00:33:12,855
What are house mouses?

340
00:33:13,165 --> 00:33:16,464
The guys who don't want
to be on the streets no more...

341
00:33:16,636 --> 00:33:19,434
...or they're on modified duty like him.

342
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:28,110
You stare back at them.
That's how you flirt with black girls.

343
00:33:29,715 --> 00:33:32,411
Hey, Ritchie, what the fuck?
They let you out?

344
00:33:32,585 --> 00:33:34,382
What am I gonna do?
What can I do?

345
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:37,022
Nothing. You can't do nothing.

346
00:33:37,823 --> 00:33:39,313
Come here, bro.

347
00:33:42,795 --> 00:33:45,593
If loving you is wrong,
I don't want to be right.

348
00:33:45,765 --> 00:33:48,563
-Don't be. You want a drink?
-Yeah.

349
00:33:48,734 --> 00:33:50,395
Hi.

350
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:53,903
-How you doing?
-Hey, barkeep...

351
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:57,440
...two shots of bourbon
and two bourbon and Cokes.

352
00:33:58,177 --> 00:34:00,338
I had to park on Christopher Street.

353
00:34:00,513 --> 00:34:03,209
Must have been 100 faggots
looking to suck my dick.

354
00:34:03,382 --> 00:34:05,441
-I'm jealous.
-Are all cops homophobic?

355
00:34:05,618 --> 00:34:07,609
What are you,
one of them feminists?

356
00:34:10,189 --> 00:34:13,124
I thought you might be
one as well, detective.

357
00:34:13,292 --> 00:34:16,193
-Why?
-Malloy says that you like fat women.

358
00:34:18,965 --> 00:34:20,728
-You told her that?
-Yeah, why not?

359
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:24,063
Made me think you had
a generous, even a sympathetic, view.

360
00:34:24,236 --> 00:34:26,602
-You like fat girls?
-Yeah.

361
00:34:26,772 --> 00:34:28,364
-Yeah, why?
-I like fat chicks.

362
00:34:31,844 --> 00:34:34,642
-That chick.
-Yeah. What's up?

363
00:34:35,014 --> 00:34:36,982
That chick wants to suck your dick.

364
00:34:37,717 --> 00:34:39,810
All you need are tits,
a hole and a heartbeat.

365
00:34:39,986 --> 00:34:41,510
You don't even need the tits.

366
00:34:41,687 --> 00:34:44,349
You don't even need
the heartbeat, pal.

367
00:34:47,059 --> 00:34:48,856
You going fishing?

368
00:34:49,028 --> 00:34:51,724
-Want me to clock you out?
-No, I'll stay for a while.

369
00:36:07,773 --> 00:36:09,604
Miss?

370
00:36:09,775 --> 00:36:12,039
I didn't hit you.

371
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:14,539
I'm not-- It's not my fault.

372
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:16,773
-Are you okay, miss?
-Yeah.

373
00:36:16,949 --> 00:36:18,473
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

374
00:36:18,651 --> 00:36:21,711
-I give you a ride.
-Okay.

375
00:36:23,422 --> 00:36:25,014
Are--?

376
00:36:25,825 --> 00:36:27,224
Okay.

377
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:28,985
-You okay?
-Do you have a phone?

378
00:36:29,161 --> 00:36:30,287
I give you.

379
00:36:48,447 --> 00:36:50,142
Malloy?

380
00:36:50,549 --> 00:36:51,573
It's me.

381
00:37:02,561 --> 00:37:05,655
Oh, yeah. Yeah, it looked
a lot worse than it is.

382
00:37:05,831 --> 00:37:08,391
You'll be all right. It's just a scrape.

383
00:37:10,469 --> 00:37:12,699
Did you get a look at him?

384
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:16,836
No, he was wearing a mask.

385
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:21,145
Anything stand out? Like...

386
00:37:21,313 --> 00:37:26,341
...a smell, rings on his fingers,
watch, shoes, anything?

387
00:37:27,753 --> 00:37:29,345
How was that girl killed?

388
00:37:30,923 --> 00:37:34,324
-Who?
-The girl killed at the Red Turtle.

389
00:37:34,493 --> 00:37:35,960
Angela Sands?

390
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:39,822
She wasn't killed at the Red Turtle.
You're getting confused.

391
00:37:40,533 --> 00:37:43,764
What is "disarticulation" exactly?

392
00:37:45,604 --> 00:37:50,405
Listen, it's not likely that
your assailant's the murderer, babe.

393
00:37:52,178 --> 00:37:55,306
It's much more likely
he's after your wallet.

394
00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:00,041
So you won't tell me
how she was killed?

395
00:38:00,219 --> 00:38:02,483
You really want to know?

396
00:38:05,391 --> 00:38:07,655
Her throat was slit
with a straight razor.

397
00:38:08,794 --> 00:38:12,161
He was trying to take her head,
maybe for a souvenir.

398
00:38:13,399 --> 00:38:17,233
We found another dismembered
female body last June along the river.

399
00:38:17,403 --> 00:38:20,930
I think it's the same killer.
Ritchie don't, but I do.

400
00:38:30,249 --> 00:38:31,716
Go over it again.

401
00:38:33,886 --> 00:38:36,047
No. Show me.

402
00:38:36,655 --> 00:38:38,714
Come here. Show me.

403
00:38:48,167 --> 00:38:51,159
-He came from behind you?
-I don't know.

404
00:38:51,337 --> 00:38:53,931
Did you turn?

405
00:38:54,106 --> 00:38:58,133
He just grabbed my head in his arm.
He had his arm around my neck.

406
00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:00,744
So he must have come up
from behind you, then.

407
00:39:00,913 --> 00:39:02,972
Was it his right arm?

408
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:07,375
Or his left?

409
00:39:11,457 --> 00:39:13,254
It was his right.

410
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:38,944
All right.

411
00:40:00,205 --> 00:40:02,002
What's that?

412
00:40:15,821 --> 00:40:18,153
Take those off.

413
00:40:19,158 --> 00:40:20,716
<i>No.</i>

414
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:51,281
What? Yeah.

415
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:53,418
That's it.

416
00:41:53,585 --> 00:41:55,348
That's it.

417
00:42:02,161 --> 00:42:05,187
-I've been wondering about you.
-Yeah? Don't.

418
00:42:05,364 --> 00:42:07,332
-I want to know.
-Know what?

419
00:42:07,499 --> 00:42:09,694
How you did that to me.

420
00:42:12,771 --> 00:42:14,432
Somebody taught you.

421
00:42:14,606 --> 00:42:17,473
-Who was that?
-Get the fuck out of here.

422
00:42:17,643 --> 00:42:19,873
You can tell me.

423
00:42:20,846 --> 00:42:22,973
An older woman.

424
00:42:26,351 --> 00:42:28,546
An older woman, huh?

425
00:42:29,054 --> 00:42:30,248
The chicken lady.

426
00:42:31,123 --> 00:42:33,250
-The chicken lady?
-Oh, you know her?

427
00:42:37,162 --> 00:42:40,563
When I was 15, I was delivering
chickens for a butcher...

428
00:42:40,732 --> 00:42:43,098
...to housewives for a buck a chicken.

429
00:42:43,268 --> 00:42:48,604
The first time I show up there,
it was fucking hot, and....

430
00:42:48,841 --> 00:42:53,278
I came to the door,
she offered me a glass of water.

431
00:42:53,579 --> 00:42:57,675
So we're in the kitchen talking
about the weather or some shit...

432
00:42:57,850 --> 00:43:01,786
...and she just reaches out,
she grabs ahold of my joint.

433
00:43:02,354 --> 00:43:04,618
She asks me:

434
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:07,281
"Does that feel good?"
I said, "Yeah."

435
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:11,555
And she asks me,
"You ever been with a woman?"

436
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:15,427
And I said, "Yeah. No."

437
00:43:16,401 --> 00:43:20,064
So she takes me into the bedroom.

438
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:22,867
She takes her clothes off,
and she's a real woman.

439
00:43:23,041 --> 00:43:25,441
I mean, she's got pubic hair
from here to here.

440
00:43:25,611 --> 00:43:28,307
It's black and curly
like those Spanish girls.

441
00:43:28,881 --> 00:43:32,715
And I want to get the fuck out
of there, so she grabs me...

442
00:43:32,885 --> 00:43:36,252
...and says, "Have you ever
kissed a girl down there?"

443
00:43:36,421 --> 00:43:39,356
I said, "No."

444
00:43:40,592 --> 00:43:45,256
So she wets her fingers.

445
00:43:52,237 --> 00:43:55,934
She touches herself real soft.

446
00:43:59,244 --> 00:44:03,044
She touches her clit
and tells me to lick there.

447
00:44:03,215 --> 00:44:08,585
Tells me to put my tongue there,
take my time, lick in a slow circle.

448
00:44:11,056 --> 00:44:14,184
And after a while she came.

449
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:29,538
She asked me to give her....

450
00:44:32,411 --> 00:44:34,936
Get on top of her
and look her in the eyes.

451
00:45:01,473 --> 00:45:05,273
-Why did you go back?
-My kids. I missed my kids.

452
00:45:05,444 --> 00:45:08,072
I didn't know you had kids.

453
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:10,477
How would you?

454
00:45:12,517 --> 00:45:16,977
My oldest boy wants to be a teacher.
I don't know what happened to him.

455
00:45:17,155 --> 00:45:21,091
It's like Martians landed
and took over his brain.

456
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:25,560
-What does he want to teach?
-Schmoogs. Can you believe it?

457
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:33,938
Hey, I'm missing one of my....

458
00:45:34,973 --> 00:45:39,137
I'm missing one of the charms
on my bracelet.

459
00:45:46,485 --> 00:45:48,180
Maybe on West Broadway.

460
00:45:57,996 --> 00:45:59,987
Hey...

461
00:46:03,201 --> 00:46:05,829
...there's something
I really do have to tell you.

462
00:46:06,004 --> 00:46:07,232
Oh, yeah?

463
00:46:08,707 --> 00:46:12,268
You've seen me before.
I've seen you at the Red Turtle.

464
00:46:12,444 --> 00:46:15,641
This whole time, I'm thinking,
"I've seen this girl before."

465
00:46:15,814 --> 00:46:18,510
And now you're telling me
I met you at the Red Turtle.

466
00:46:18,684 --> 00:46:21,778
-I don't think so, babe.
-It was dark...

467
00:46:21,953 --> 00:46:24,751
...and I had on my glasses.

468
00:46:26,258 --> 00:46:27,725
And there was a man...

469
00:46:28,193 --> 00:46:32,061
...and a girl, and she was
giving him a blowjob.

470
00:46:32,230 --> 00:46:34,323
A blowjob?

471
00:46:36,201 --> 00:46:38,795
-And I watched.
-Oh, you did, did you?

472
00:46:38,970 --> 00:46:41,598
You like that sort of thing?
You like watching?

473
00:46:41,973 --> 00:46:45,875
You don't remember a girl with blue
fingernails with diamonds in them?

474
00:46:47,379 --> 00:46:50,280
What did you say? Blue fingernails?

475
00:46:51,249 --> 00:46:54,548
-She had brown hair?
-Yes.

476
00:46:56,288 --> 00:46:58,688
Yeah, what about her?

477
00:46:58,857 --> 00:47:02,850
I think that's Angela Sands.
That's the girl that was murdered.

478
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:05,861
But I wasn't with her.
I think you saw something.

479
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:09,000
You should come to the station
and look at some pictures...

480
00:47:09,167 --> 00:47:11,362
...as soon as possible.

481
00:47:13,004 --> 00:47:14,995
-Swear you weren't there.
-Swear to God.

482
00:47:15,173 --> 00:47:19,041
I never seen you or her before
in my entire fucking life.

483
00:47:22,881 --> 00:47:25,213
I gotta get out of here.

484
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:30,116
Hey, I had a nice time.

485
00:47:30,288 --> 00:47:32,051
Thanks.

486
00:48:19,871 --> 00:48:23,602
Oh, God, I could have lost you.

487
00:48:24,876 --> 00:48:29,404
-Then you let the detective fuck you.
-I didn't let him, I wanted to.

488
00:48:30,882 --> 00:48:32,975
-Have you ordered?
-Double latte, no foam.

489
00:48:33,151 --> 00:48:34,448
Yeah.

490
00:48:37,088 --> 00:48:39,022
It's sore, huh?

491
00:48:40,892 --> 00:48:43,053
So the detective guy's sexy?

492
00:48:44,296 --> 00:48:47,595
You like him?
You gonna see him again?

493
00:48:47,766 --> 00:48:50,234
Would you trust a guy
who gets blowjobs in bars?

494
00:48:50,402 --> 00:48:52,165
Yes.

495
00:48:54,506 --> 00:48:56,303
I think he's a liar.

496
00:48:56,475 --> 00:49:01,435
You think he's a liar, or he is a liar?
Because, of course, we never lie, so....

497
00:49:01,613 --> 00:49:03,843
I saw him in a bar with a girl.

498
00:49:04,015 --> 00:49:05,539
Wait.

499
00:49:05,717 --> 00:49:07,412
-A bar?
-Yeah.

500
00:49:07,586 --> 00:49:11,352
I thought you just met him.
I thought that he rescued you.

501
00:49:11,523 --> 00:49:15,357
-lf you don't want him, I'll take him.
-Forget it, Pauline. Forget it.

502
00:49:15,527 --> 00:49:20,055
No, arrange an introduction
with your lying detective.

503
00:49:25,904 --> 00:49:27,929
Who's that?

504
00:49:28,106 --> 00:49:30,165
John Graham.

505
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:33,607
I thought you said
he looked like a movie star?

506
00:49:33,778 --> 00:49:37,475
He played a doctor on a soap.
Now he's studying to be one.

507
00:49:38,283 --> 00:49:40,080
Hi.

508
00:49:40,252 --> 00:49:43,050
-You look terrible.
-Excuse me, sir. No dogs in here.

509
00:49:43,221 --> 00:49:45,189
I know that.

510
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:48,190
-Will you be long?
-I just ordered a coffee.

511
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:51,659
-You're very tan.
-Hi, John Graham.

512
00:49:51,830 --> 00:49:54,355
-Pauline.
-How are you?

513
00:49:58,336 --> 00:50:00,463
Take your time. I'll wait.

514
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:08,543
Don't look out there,
because he's watching you.

515
00:50:08,713 --> 00:50:11,045
Oh, he's so intense.

516
00:50:14,986 --> 00:50:16,920
I remember every guy
I ever fucked...

517
00:50:17,088 --> 00:50:21,525
...by how he liked to do it,
not how I wanted to do it.

518
00:50:22,994 --> 00:50:27,055
Sometimes I think it's just me.
I mean, are other women able to say:

519
00:50:27,232 --> 00:50:29,462
"Suck my dick, pinch my nipples,
bend over"?

520
00:50:29,634 --> 00:50:32,501
Probably not "suck my dick."

521
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:47,309
Here's what I think.

522
00:50:47,485 --> 00:50:52,422
I think you can come over to my place
and sleep there for a few nights...

523
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:56,755
...maybe even a week.
It would make me really happy.

524
00:50:59,464 --> 00:51:03,457
And the mugger has your wallet,
so he's gonna know where you live.

525
00:51:06,471 --> 00:51:10,771
You know, you really have
to see this detective again.

526
00:51:21,152 --> 00:51:23,382
I ordered a coffee.

527
00:51:24,289 --> 00:51:26,450
Miss, we ordered a latte.

528
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:30,322
-No foam.
-No foam, very, very dry. Thank you.

529
00:51:30,495 --> 00:51:32,588
He's still there.

530
00:51:34,299 --> 00:51:35,967
Whose car did you get into yesterday?
It looked like it'd just come from Beirut.

531
00:51:35,967 --> 00:51:38,765
Whose car did you get into yesterday?
It looked like it'd just come from Beirut.

532
00:51:38,937 --> 00:51:42,566
I don't know how people
can drive around in filthy cars.

533
00:51:42,741 --> 00:51:45,403
-Maybe one of my students.
-Are you dating a student?

534
00:51:45,577 --> 00:51:46,566
Pardon?

535
00:51:46,745 --> 00:51:49,407
You went to the Red Turtle Bar
with a black student.

536
00:51:49,581 --> 00:51:52,641
-Are you dating him?
-No.

537
00:51:52,817 --> 00:51:55,615
I saw you last Saturday.

538
00:51:55,787 --> 00:52:00,520
-What were you doing?
-Is that the point? I don't think so.

539
00:52:00,692 --> 00:52:03,217
The point is that he could
get the wrong idea.

540
00:52:03,395 --> 00:52:05,920
You don't know how guys think.

541
00:52:06,097 --> 00:52:08,463
Are you all right, John?

542
00:52:11,403 --> 00:52:14,497
Not really. I've....

543
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:17,335
I've been having these
panic attacks lately.

544
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:20,034
-I don't know. They're pretty bad.
-What happens?

545
00:52:20,211 --> 00:52:22,406
Do you ever get
these funny images...

546
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:25,777
...from the past, like you saw
something or you knew something?

547
00:52:25,950 --> 00:52:28,919
Weird memories from childhood?

548
00:52:29,087 --> 00:52:33,217
I just wish I didn't keep having
these funny attacks. My brain....

549
00:52:33,391 --> 00:52:37,225
Well, my brain practically explodes.
I'm gonna go on antidepressants.

550
00:52:38,797 --> 00:52:40,924
I need to ask you a favor.

551
00:52:41,099 --> 00:52:43,624
Do you think you could
take care of Patrick?

552
00:52:43,802 --> 00:52:47,329
He's barking all the time. Probably
because my hours are so long.

553
00:52:47,505 --> 00:52:50,406
John, I can't take care of a dog.

554
00:52:52,110 --> 00:52:55,238
Especially not my dog, right?
You'd rather cut his head off.

555
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:58,644
No, not especially your dog.

556
00:52:58,817 --> 00:53:01,911
Why don't you put up
a notice or something.

557
00:53:02,087 --> 00:53:07,081
Put up a notice? Where am I?
I'm in the hospital 18 hours out of 24.

558
00:53:07,492 --> 00:53:09,483
You don't get it, do you?

559
00:53:12,097 --> 00:53:14,657
Well, okay. Come here.

560
00:53:17,168 --> 00:53:18,931
Say goodbye.

561
00:53:20,305 --> 00:53:22,500
John, are you gonna put him down?

562
00:53:23,475 --> 00:53:26,410
Maybe. I don't know, maybe I will.

563
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:29,274
I could do it myself.
I could shave his little arm--

564
00:53:29,447 --> 00:53:32,348
I don't think it's a good idea
that we see each other.

565
00:53:32,517 --> 00:53:34,212
Fuck!

566
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:37,649
Fuck.

567
00:53:37,822 --> 00:53:39,346
Well....

568
00:53:39,891 --> 00:53:41,552
Fuck.

569
00:53:43,194 --> 00:53:45,685
Well, this is out of the blue.

570
00:53:45,864 --> 00:53:48,059
I'm gonna....

571
00:53:48,233 --> 00:53:50,633
I'm gonna have to think about this.

572
00:54:14,959 --> 00:54:20,158
<i>Midway along the journey of our life</i>
<i>I woke to find myself in a dark wood...</i>

573
00:54:20,665 --> 00:54:24,362
<i>...for I had wandered off</i>
<i>from the straight path.</i>

574
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:43,954
Thanks.

575
00:54:46,457 --> 00:54:48,220
Thank you.

576
00:55:02,207 --> 00:55:03,504
I fell over.

577
00:55:05,643 --> 00:55:08,840
-Truly?
-Yours truly.

578
00:55:10,782 --> 00:55:12,340
You don't never talk.

579
00:55:12,884 --> 00:55:15,751
-It's always just jive.
-Well, I like to be ironic.

580
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:18,514
I'm looking for Miss Avery,
Francis Avery?

581
00:55:18,723 --> 00:55:21,157
-She's gone. Her class is finished.
-It's over?

582
00:55:21,326 --> 00:55:26,559
-Which one is it? This one down here?
-She might still be in the staff lounge.

583
00:55:27,565 --> 00:55:29,863
I've been thinking on Gacy, you know?

584
00:55:30,501 --> 00:55:32,731
Pogo the Clown?

585
00:55:32,904 --> 00:55:36,237
I've been thinking
that it wasn't his fault, you know?

586
00:55:36,407 --> 00:55:38,068
Like, he were the victim.

587
00:55:38,243 --> 00:55:40,177
What do you know
about Cornelius Webb?

588
00:55:41,412 --> 00:55:43,277
Of what?

589
00:55:44,048 --> 00:55:45,072
Desire.

590
00:55:48,653 --> 00:55:52,487
-Aren't you gonna help carry my bag?
-No.

591
00:55:52,657 --> 00:55:55,956
You're an Amazon, Miss Avery.
That's like an insult.

592
00:56:07,071 --> 00:56:09,062
-So we're here?
-Yeah.

593
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:12,073
-Hey, Papi.
-Hey, baby.

594
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:17,510
-I'm gonna help you upstairs.
-No, I got it. Thank you.

595
00:56:17,682 --> 00:56:21,812
-No, let me help you upstairs.
-I really don't-- Okay, bye.

596
00:56:22,654 --> 00:56:24,315
Good night.

597
00:56:27,325 --> 00:56:30,453
-Let me get this for you.
-I got it. Thank you, Cornelius.

598
00:56:30,628 --> 00:56:31,686
-You okay?
-Yeah.

599
00:56:31,863 --> 00:56:33,956
You sure?

600
00:56:34,132 --> 00:56:37,158
Oh, that was very smooth, Daddy.

601
00:56:37,335 --> 00:56:40,668
Oh, that turned me on.
That was nice. Give me a kiss.

602
00:56:40,838 --> 00:56:42,931
-Go away, man!
-Don't do that. Come here.

603
00:56:43,107 --> 00:56:46,042
-Don't do that.
-Sit right here. Oh, you are so sexy.

604
00:56:46,210 --> 00:56:48,838
Help me put my earring back in.
Come here.

605
00:56:57,422 --> 00:57:00,323
<i>In 1978, Mr. John Wayne Gacy</i>
<i>was in trouble...</i>

606
00:57:00,491 --> 00:57:04,291
<i>...when the police dug up</i>
<i>a dead body under his cellar.</i>

607
00:57:04,462 --> 00:57:08,694
<i>When the police were done,</i>
<i>they had 27 dead bodies.</i>

608
00:57:09,267 --> 00:57:11,861
<i>Most of them from under the house.</i>

609
00:57:12,036 --> 00:57:13,970
<i>He said he was innocent</i>
<i>of the crime...</i>

610
00:57:14,138 --> 00:57:17,574
<i>...and sometimes he said</i>
<i>that he loved those boys.</i>

611
00:57:19,210 --> 00:57:22,145
<i>He never said he was sorry.</i>

612
00:57:22,313 --> 00:57:26,374
<i>Not even at the end, when they</i>
<i>gave him his lethal injection.</i>

613
00:57:26,551 --> 00:57:30,146
<i>"He was chatty, " his guard said.</i>

614
00:57:30,321 --> 00:57:35,088
<i>He wanted to discuss the Chicago</i>
<i>Cubs and eat fried chicken.</i>

615
00:58:08,726 --> 00:58:11,957
I'm gonna take a sleeping pill.
Two, in fact.

616
00:58:12,130 --> 00:58:13,757
Do you want one?

617
00:58:13,931 --> 00:58:15,865
No.

618
00:58:16,567 --> 00:58:21,095
It's so fucking noisy I can't sleep.
I have to move.

619
00:58:21,706 --> 00:58:24,698
I mean, clearly, I have got to move.

620
00:58:32,617 --> 00:58:34,915
Why don't you see him again.

621
00:58:36,454 --> 00:58:40,447
You're brave in so many ways.
You're thinking about him, right?

622
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:45,989
-About sex.
-So?

623
00:58:46,164 --> 00:58:50,100
You wouldn't be thinking
about the sex if you didn't like him.

624
00:58:54,105 --> 00:58:57,006
Well, at least call him.
He doesn't know where you are.

625
00:58:57,809 --> 00:59:00,744
I go to court tomorrow...

626
00:59:02,447 --> 00:59:04,745
...because of the tan suit.

627
00:59:04,916 --> 00:59:08,352
They're trying to get
a restraining order against me.

628
00:59:09,187 --> 00:59:13,351
Probably won't be allowed
within 500 miles of Dr. Cass' office.

629
00:59:13,524 --> 00:59:15,219
Yeah, laugh it up.

630
00:59:15,393 --> 00:59:18,328
-You know what I'm thinking?
-What to wear.

631
00:59:19,263 --> 00:59:23,632
No, I'm imagining
that when he sees me...

632
00:59:23,801 --> 00:59:27,464
...he's gonna realize that
he's in love with me, and, you know...

633
00:59:27,638 --> 00:59:32,132
...one thing will lead to another,
and after a love child or two...

634
00:59:33,544 --> 00:59:35,876
...we'll get married.

635
00:59:37,348 --> 00:59:41,785
Have I ever told you how
our father proposed to my mother?

636
00:59:41,953 --> 00:59:44,945
No. Tell me.

637
00:59:45,123 --> 00:59:49,287
Well, when he was very young,
he was...

638
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:51,860
<i>...very handsome</i>
<i>and an excellent skater.</i>

639
00:59:52,263 --> 00:59:55,528
And she was the new girl in town,
barely able to skate.
