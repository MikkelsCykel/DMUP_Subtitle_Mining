1
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:28,171
Wake up, sleepyhead. lt's sunset.

2
00:03:34,814 --> 00:03:37,078
Board of Education Chairman....

3
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:41,750
-Good evening, Sebastian.
-Good evening, Countess.

4
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:58,361
Austrian peasant.

5
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,441
Early 1 700s....

6
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:06,275
O-positive.

7
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:07,944
Very nice...

8
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:11,542
but not vintage, and certainly not virgin.

9
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:14,711
Virgin blood isn't easy to come by
these days, Countess.

10
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:16,448
You're telling me.

11
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:23,494
How many days left
till Halloween, Sebastian?

12
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:28,327
Little more than a week, Countess.
l told you not to worry.

13
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:30,134
Not to worry?

14
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,235
How amusing.

15
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:36,504
You're not the one that has to have
the virgin blood of a young man...

16
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:40,375
not once, but three times
before All Hallows' Eve.

17
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,613
Not to worry?

18
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:46,677
Being a vampire in the 20th century
is a nightmare!

19
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:57,626
Did we get up on the wrong side
of the coffin this evening?

20
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:06,763
Must be the delegation from below.

21
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,778
You, wipe your feet.

22
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:19,712
After 1 20 years,
you still have Georgia clay on your boots.

23
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:24,750
You're a long way from Covent Garden.
Your report?

24
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:27,653
Countess, we've been all over
this metropolis.

25
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,853
With nothing to show for it?

26
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:32,988
Do you realize that it's less than 10 days
until Halloween?

27
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:37,900
Times have changed. When you found me,
it was 1864. Virginity was still popular.

28
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,936
Stop being so damned negative.

29
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:45,107
There must be a virgin out there. Find him!

30
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:47,475
Unless the Countess gets
what she must have...

31
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:51,141
you lose your refuge and her protection.
ls that clear?

32
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:55,646
The closest we've come so far
is an 1 1-year-old.

33
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:57,617
Don't be disgusting.

34
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:01,624
No more excuses! She's heard them all.
She wants action.

35
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:04,058
And she wants it now.

36
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:10,734
Get out there and find me a virgin!

37
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:15,899
l want to, l really do.

38
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:18,443
Robin, please!

39
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:22,470
Mark, we've been through this sex thing
a million times.

40
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:25,417
Halfway through it a million times.

41
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,981
lt's what people do when they are in love.

42
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:31,056
lt's natural. lt's right.

43
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:34,887
lt's not natural for me to do it in a car.

44
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:38,457
What about an ice-cream truck?

45
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:01,911
What?

46
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:04,089
Do you have a creamsicle?

47
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:07,949
Take a hike! We're closed for renovations.

48
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:31,316
Jeez.

49
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,544
Sorry. l'll put it in third.

50
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,058
Look, Mark...

51
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,590
l want to. l really do.

52
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:46,590
But l want it to be special.

53
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:02,478
Sorry.

54
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:07,078
Please understand.

55
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:13,182
Shit.

56
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,530
Based on my broad and varied experience...

57
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:01,129
l'm telling you,
girls have a six-year cutoff time.

58
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,142
lf they haven't put out in the first six years,
they figure, ''why bother?''

59
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:08,938
No. She just thinks if it's good, it can wait.

60
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:12,573
Oh, yeah? Look at me. l'm good. l can't wait.

61
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:20,384
-You call that well-done? lt's still meowing.
-lt's burnt.

62
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:24,895
l don't know. There's too much pressure
about getting laid.

63
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:27,693
lt's like taking a driver's test for manhood.

64
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:29,568
l don't know.

65
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,029
l don't know what l'm doing wrong.

66
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,803
Right now, l'm as close
to physical perfection as l'm gonna get.

67
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:39,142
That's depressing. Really depressing.

68
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:44,541
Sometimes l think l should just go out,
find some strange woman and get laid.

69
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:48,347
Then l could go back to Robin
without all this pressure between us.

70
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,895
Now that's a burger!

71
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:06,633
We should check out
some of the bars in Hollywood.

72
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:08,764
l don't want to do that.

73
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:10,865
-That's where all the weirdoes are.
-Exactly.

74
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:13,445
Because that's where all the action is.

75
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:16,413
We might as well.
Nothing ever happens here.

76
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:18,777
We live in a sexual wasteland.

77
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:20,746
What if Robin finds out?

78
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:23,014
Who's gonna tell her? Not me.

79
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:28,823
Come on. l wouldn't say nothing.

80
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:31,657
Not if she got down on her knees and....

81
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,294
Get out!

82
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:29,773
We'll have three beers, all around.

83
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:36,373
Watch.

84
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:57,031
Number 1 7.

85
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,969
Hi there! Number 1 7?

86
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:05,907
l'm Russ and l'm a Sagittarius.

87
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:09,438
l enjoy surfing, candlelit dinners,
and Tolstoy.

88
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:15,549
Look, l'm a mature person,
and you are a mature person, so....

89
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,679
She said, ''Come on over!''

90
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:21,719
You got it, honey.

91
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,097
Don't wait up.

92
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,464
Hi there, Russ.

93
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:36,370
-Hi.
-Sit down.

94
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:41,536
A Sagittarius! Dynamite! l'm a Gemini.

95
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:44,674
Hey, man, do you know what that means?

96
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:46,479
Like H2O!

97
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,856
Are you a guy?

98
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:54,849
Does it matter?

99
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:00,958
Sissy.

100
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:11,938
Want to leave now? This place is stupid.

101
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:14,773
Are you kidding? We haven't scored yet.

102
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,807
Score? Not here, that's for sure.

103
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:20,175
Look around you.

104
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:22,852
Yuppie city.

105
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:25,048
You got it. We don't belong.

106
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:31,628
Studs ''R'' Us.

107
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,661
Number four at the bar.

108
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,532
Am l sitting in the middle, wearing a red tie?

109
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:46,100
She wants you to have a drink with her.

110
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:49,271
-He'll be right there.
-All right, move it, man!

111
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,647
l don't feel good about this.

112
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,514
Come on, go for it. Live dangerously...

113
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:55,954
stud!

114
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:57,713
All right. Okay.

115
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,184
Come on.

116
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:18,473
Go for it!

117
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:45,159
Hello, tall, dark and handsome.

118
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,829
Me?

119
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:50,697
Hi.

120
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:53,135
What's your name?

121
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,575
Mark Kendall.

122
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:03,117
Can l buy you a drink?

123
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:06,649
l was hoping
you would share my champagne.

124
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:09,054
Oh, yeah.

125
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:18,099
What's your name?

126
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:21,534
-Just call me ''Countess.''
-''Countess''?

127
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:28,071
That's great. l like that.
l had a dog named King once.

128
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:40,956
Thirty-two.

129
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:45,454
Do you come here often?

130
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,555
This is my first time.

131
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:49,898
Beautiful. Great place.

132
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,941
Do you come here a lot?

133
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,569
Whenever l'm on the prowl.

134
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:08,883
How old are you?

135
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:12,717
Me? 21 .

136
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:15,917
How old are you?

137
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:18,054
Older than you think.

138
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:20,961
That's okay. l look young for my age, too.

139
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,764
People say l could pass for 18.

140
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:33,843
...the horse threw me.

141
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,642
Whore! Caught in the act, you pedophile!

142
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:41,382
Why don't you sit down
so we can discuss this like mature--

143
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:43,079
Shut up, scumbag!

144
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:46,389
So...

145
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:48,316
you're Chester!

146
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:53,696
l think there's been
a little misunderstanding. l'm not....

147
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,791
l wouldn't sit in the same room
with you, degenerate.

148
00:18:57,302 --> 00:19:00,032
-l'm Jamie--
-l wouldn't live in the same city!

149
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:03,939
We just came here to get some girls tonight.
l mean, meet some girls.

150
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:06,510
Mark's got an ice-cream truck,
and we came down.

151
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:09,103
We heard this was
a swinging place, that's all.

152
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:11,580
Figures. A kid! A degenerate kid!

153
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:14,410
Pornographer! l've read your letters!

154
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:19,713
-l wouldn't.
-They're my friends.

155
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,692
They can handle it. Don't do anything rash.

156
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:28,532
-You make me sick.
-Shut up, Harry.

157
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:30,793
Filth! That's what this is.

158
00:19:32,704 --> 00:19:34,865
You slime, this is private!

159
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:36,406
We better get out of here.

160
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:39,677
How dare you write this filth to my wife!

161
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:42,542
This is a big misunderstanding.
l didn't write anything--

162
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:45,708
-This is a big mistake on your part.
-He's got a gun!

163
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:48,917
Oh, my God!

164
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,817
Don't hang up. lt happens all the time.

165
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,423
Let's go.

166
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:13,338
Neither one of us
can afford to spend the night in jail.

167
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:16,403
Countess! Sir!

168
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:21,714
Wait, my truck! My ice-cream truck!

169
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,254
l know where it's parked. Give me the key.

170
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:27,052
You don't want to end up in the slammer.

171
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:38,565
-Daddy hurt his parts.
-Daddy was bad.

172
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:47,975
ls that a new kind of choke hold?

173
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,741
See, l told you we'd get lucky.

174
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:58,772
ls there anything you need? Food? Drinks?

175
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:00,844
A bib?

176
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,511
Thank you, no, Sebastian.

177
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:25,705
This is a nice house.

178
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:29,071
Don't see a lot of mansions where l live.

179
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,341
We just moved in.

180
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:34,442
The previous owner slaughtered his family,
and then hung himself.

181
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,744
You must've got it cheap.

182
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:38,649
Except for the cleaning bill.

183
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,423
May l get you a drink?

184
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,652
l have to ask you something.

185
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:44,623
l was wondering....

186
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:47,827
Are you a prostitute?

187
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:53,768
l'm whatever you want me to be.

188
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:56,834
Good, because l only have $5.

189
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:15,582
What would you like?

190
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:18,320
The same as you.

191
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:31,003
Try this.

192
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:35,669
l'm gonna slip into something
a little more comfortable.

193
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:37,805
-l'll be right back.
-Okay.

194
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:14,318
Okay, Sebastian. Out of the closet.

195
00:24:16,254 --> 00:24:18,916
l came out of the closet centuries ago.

196
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:21,421
Very amusing. Come on, help me.

197
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,791
Make me lovely.

198
00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:32,802
Have l ever failed you?

199
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:39,239
-How's my hair?
-Like golden wheat.

200
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:41,839
My eyes?

201
00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:43,805
Bright as Venus.

202
00:24:44,616 --> 00:24:48,017
l'm so excited. lt's as if l were young again.

203
00:24:49,087 --> 00:24:53,319
And so you shall be, lovey.
l told you not to worry.

204
00:25:32,497 --> 00:25:34,328
l see you've made yourself at home.

205
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:36,725
That's very nice.

206
00:25:37,068 --> 00:25:40,868
Did you....
Did they do that over at the shopping mall?

207
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:42,462
No.

208
00:25:43,975 --> 00:25:46,705
That was done a long time ago in Europe.

209
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:49,944
Why don't you sit here?

210
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:52,544
Sure.

211
00:26:05,463 --> 00:26:08,057
What do you do for a living?

212
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,734
l go to school. College.

213
00:26:12,103 --> 00:26:14,901
l'm studying to be an electrical engineer.

214
00:26:15,173 --> 00:26:17,334
Fascinating.

215
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,970
-My field is nuclear physics.
-Really?

216
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:23,639
l'm working on the acid rain problem.

217
00:26:24,482 --> 00:26:26,347
l love intelligent men.

218
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:30,178
l guess they're okay.

219
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:40,722
This place is great. l mean....

220
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:44,391
lt's beautiful. l mean, the....

221
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:47,333
Who decorated it, anyway?

222
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:49,099
l did.

223
00:26:49,841 --> 00:26:50,967
Great.

224
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:53,337
Pillows, and everything. Nice.

225
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:57,510
l mean, you know,
most people don't do things...

226
00:26:57,649 --> 00:26:59,583
and l think that....

227
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:02,617
l mean, that's.... They.... You do.

228
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:05,654
l mean, you do. You're a doer.

229
00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:07,985
l mean, you are a doer.

230
00:27:10,428 --> 00:27:11,793
You're a....

231
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,227
Beautiful dress, too.

232
00:27:14,332 --> 00:27:16,459
l guess you made that yourself.

233
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:19,230
l bet my mom would love
to borrow the pattern.

234
00:27:19,337 --> 00:27:21,805
l mean, my mom, she's great.

235
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:25,536
l have a picture of my family in my wallet.

236
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:28,545
You might take a look,
as long as you're down there.

237
00:27:29,748 --> 00:27:32,979
There's some Life Savers
in that other pocket, there.

238
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:05,907
What's he like?
Another crazy we don't need?

239
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:07,109
ls he cute?

240
00:28:07,218 --> 00:28:09,448
Kind of a square. Sort of a jock.

241
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:10,714
Enough!

242
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:14,581
Our new young recruit
will be joining us for Halloween.

243
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:17,890
Countess expects you all
to take him under your wings...

244
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:21,090
and make him feel at home
for the first hundred years.

245
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,632
You got that?

246
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:25,225
She found a virgin! We're home free.

247
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:29,072
l remember when l met the Countess.

248
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:31,938
The day she bit me
was the sweetest day of my young life.

249
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:35,535
There's an inch of dust under there.

250
00:28:45,023 --> 00:28:46,820
How come he rates that deluxe job?

251
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:48,654
These are the 1980s.

252
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,751
Not the Age of lnnocence.

253
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:55,964
A young man needs plenty of room.

254
00:28:57,335 --> 00:29:00,998
Sunrise in an hour. l suggest that you all...

255
00:29:01,706 --> 00:29:03,298
get an early day.

256
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:22,419
-Good day, Sebastian.
-Good day.

257
00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:26,224
Good night, Sebastian.

258
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:47,116
He's still asleep.

259
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:50,618
How was he?

260
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:52,586
Delicious.

261
00:29:52,857 --> 00:29:55,121
Are you positive he's a virgin?

262
00:29:55,693 --> 00:29:59,993
l haven't had anything this pure
since the Vienna Boys' Choir hit town.

263
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:03,590
Just make sure he doesn't slip away.

264
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,164
He won't escape me.

265
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:08,395
What'll we do with him?

266
00:30:08,506 --> 00:30:11,566
We can't very well
put him down with the others yet.

267
00:30:11,776 --> 00:30:14,870
Heavens, no. Let him go home
and build up his strength.

268
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:17,243
Tired blood is of no use to me.

269
00:30:35,466 --> 00:30:37,331
Are you feeling better?

270
00:30:39,704 --> 00:30:42,400
Sebastian brought you some orange juice.

271
00:30:50,081 --> 00:30:51,105
Sir.

272
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:55,482
Thank you.

273
00:30:58,456 --> 00:31:01,391
l'll just go check on the gentleman's truck.

274
00:31:17,675 --> 00:31:19,165
What happened?

275
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:21,779
Do you remember anything?

276
00:31:22,914 --> 00:31:24,347
Not much.

277
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:27,351
l had the weirdest dream.

278
00:31:28,753 --> 00:31:31,620
You know those little packets
of fresh fruit juice...

279
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:36,092
made out of tin foil, where you
stick little straws in them to open them?

280
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:41,994
l think l dreamt that l was one of those.

281
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:46,703
What did happen, anyway?

282
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:53,003
Let's just say...

283
00:31:53,778 --> 00:31:55,609
you earned your juice.

284
00:31:56,781 --> 00:31:58,976
-l did?
-You certainly did.

285
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:01,711
Really? That's great.

286
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,882
l don't believe it. lt finally happened.

287
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:07,147
Did l enjoy it?

288
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:20,363
We'll be seeing each other again soon?

289
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:23,465
Yeah.

290
00:32:26,477 --> 00:32:28,035
l have a bit of a problem.

291
00:32:28,146 --> 00:32:29,909
-A problem?
-Yeah.

292
00:32:33,017 --> 00:32:35,349
See, l'm sort of committed...

293
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:37,855
to this really nice girl.

294
00:32:40,658 --> 00:32:41,818
l don't mind.

295
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,258
l've often been the other woman.

296
00:32:45,163 --> 00:32:47,324
That's real unselfish of you.

297
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:49,997
Tell you what, l'll be in touch.

298
00:32:53,604 --> 00:32:55,037
Later, blood.

299
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:07,614
Start your day off with a smile.

300
00:33:09,854 --> 00:33:11,446
How sweet of you.

301
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,018
Drive carefully.

302
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:20,187
Remember, part of you belongs to me now.

303
00:33:20,631 --> 00:33:22,724
l'll see you in your dreams.

304
00:33:23,568 --> 00:33:24,899
Sure thing.

305
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:07,241
Rare hamburger, please.

306
00:34:08,746 --> 00:34:10,373
Very rare, please.

307
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:15,044
Can l have one of those uncooked ones?

308
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:24,387
Right.

309
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:36,966
Hey, stud.

310
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:43,708
What happened to you guys Saturday night?
l called you Sunday, but you were out.

311
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:45,749
lt was a total disaster.

312
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:48,943
l don't know.
The strip search was kind of fun.

313
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:52,582
But, hey, how about you?
Did you go for the pokey?

314
00:34:53,691 --> 00:34:55,591
l don't want to talk about it.

315
00:34:55,693 --> 00:34:57,991
You did it with her, didn't you?

316
00:34:58,996 --> 00:35:02,454
-l guess.
-Jesus, God, those breasts!

317
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:08,602
Has it changed you any?
l mean, do you feel more manly or mature?

318
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:13,907
lt was all a big mistake. l was so drunk,
l don't remember much, you know.

319
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:17,777
Come on! Tell us what happened.
Blow by beautiful blow!

320
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:20,146
Did you undress her slowly...

321
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:23,812
first baring her big, luscious magoombas?

322
00:35:23,921 --> 00:35:26,219
Did she have any tattoos
or scars or anything?

323
00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:28,485
l told you, l don't remember!

324
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:34,525
lf you're so interested in my sexual failures,
why don't you go have a few of your own?

325
00:35:38,002 --> 00:35:39,731
Robin, wait a second.

326
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:44,897
Where'd you find her?
A 7-Eleven, a bowling alley?

327
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:53,940
Wait up!

328
00:35:57,889 --> 00:36:00,653
Saturday night,
the three of us went up to Hollywood.

329
00:36:00,758 --> 00:36:01,816
Hollywood?

330
00:36:01,926 --> 00:36:03,917
lt was Russ's stupid idea.

331
00:36:04,195 --> 00:36:08,894
You mean to tell me you went home with
a woman you met in a bar in Hollywood?

332
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:13,327
And?

333
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,265
l don't want to talk about it.

334
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:18,433
You didn't make love to her?

335
00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:20,238
l think so. l don't know.

336
00:36:20,411 --> 00:36:22,641
You think so? You don't know?

337
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:25,045
l remember she bit the buttons off my shirt.

338
00:36:25,149 --> 00:36:28,084
The next thing l remember,
Sebastian bringing me orange juice.

339
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,211
-Sebastian?
-The chauffeur.

340
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:32,589
The chauffeur?

341
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:34,988
Also like the butler, too.

342
00:36:35,092 --> 00:36:37,890
The butler? You mean
they all saw her bite your buttons?

343
00:36:37,995 --> 00:36:38,984
No!

344
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:42,197
l mean, l don't know
what happened, exactly.

345
00:36:44,835 --> 00:36:48,532
l can't believe you'll throw away
our relationship on a one-night stand...

346
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:52,006
with a chauffeur and a butler
and a slut who eats buttons.

347
00:36:52,109 --> 00:36:54,202
But you did, you really did.

348
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,246
You can have your damn ring back!

349
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,815
What am l supposed to do with it?

350
00:37:00,918 --> 00:37:02,681
Use your imagination.

351
00:37:21,105 --> 00:37:23,073
What are you doing?

352
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:25,309
l'm dissecting this frog.

353
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:29,505
But you're not a member of this class.

354
00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:33,243
l'm not?

355
00:37:33,651 --> 00:37:36,814
To my knowledge,
you have never attended lab before.

356
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:41,857
You're right.

357
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,227
l'm sorry.

358
00:37:53,371 --> 00:37:54,497
There.

359
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,598
He's still good.

360
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:16,157
You in here?

361
00:38:23,868 --> 00:38:24,857
Hi.

362
00:38:31,108 --> 00:38:33,201
What are you doing in there?

363
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:34,744
Taking a nap.

364
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:40,549
Are you feeling all right?

365
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:42,516
Sure, l feel fine. Why?

366
00:38:44,922 --> 00:38:47,982
Your mother thinks
that you should see a doctor.

367
00:38:48,192 --> 00:38:49,921
You've been awful pale lately.

368
00:38:50,027 --> 00:38:51,892
We know you haven't been sleeping...

369
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:55,261
because we can hear you
pacing the house all night.

370
00:38:55,533 --> 00:38:57,057
l'm fine. Really.

371
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,499
-Really?
-Yeah.

372
00:38:58,602 --> 00:39:00,695
-l am a little tense.
-Tense?

373
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:03,000
Robin and l
have been having some problems.

374
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:06,133
l see. Everything is under control?

375
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:08,269
Yeah.

376
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:15,383
We'll see how you feel in a couple of days.

377
00:39:17,121 --> 00:39:19,316
Just get a good night's sleep.

378
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:25,359
ln the bed.

379
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:27,661
You know...

380
00:39:27,898 --> 00:39:30,059
make your mother feel better.

381
00:39:35,406 --> 00:39:37,135
l'll close the door.

382
00:42:31,615 --> 00:42:33,606
What has Mark done with his hair?

383
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:35,981
-l think it's cute.
-lt's weird.

384
00:42:36,086 --> 00:42:39,578
So, you and Mark
broke up for good this time?

385
00:42:40,524 --> 00:42:42,219
l don't believe it.

386
00:42:42,459 --> 00:42:45,019
l thought he was different than other guys.

387
00:42:45,296 --> 00:42:48,424
-You know, more sensitive.
-l like a sensitive man.

388
00:42:48,532 --> 00:42:52,093
One who isn't afraid to show his emotions
or cry on your shoulder.

389
00:42:53,504 --> 00:42:54,766
Cracks me up.

390
00:42:55,306 --> 00:42:57,570
Can l talk to you for a second?

391
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:05,211
l called you 10 times last night.
Why didn't you talk?

392
00:43:05,316 --> 00:43:07,511
There's nothing to talk about.

393
00:43:07,785 --> 00:43:11,118
You go out behind my back,
pick up a woman at a bar...

394
00:43:11,221 --> 00:43:13,746
go home with her,
and then pretend nothing happened.

395
00:43:13,857 --> 00:43:15,984
l don't want to talk about that.

396
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:18,254
That's not fair. l was drunk.

397
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:21,253
That's exactly what l'm talking about.

398
00:43:21,465 --> 00:43:23,797
You're not the Mark l thought l knew.

399
00:43:24,702 --> 00:43:26,260
Look at your hair, even.

400
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:28,395
You look like Jerry Lewis.

401
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:30,834
l thought l looked more like De Niro.

402
00:43:32,209 --> 00:43:33,699
lt looks weird.

403
00:43:34,345 --> 00:43:38,111
l'm sorry, okay?
lt's not supposed to be a fashion statement.

404
00:43:39,016 --> 00:43:41,484
l made a stupid mistake. l'm sorry.

405
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:45,552
l'm a teenager.
l'm supposed to make stupid mistakes.

406
00:43:46,056 --> 00:43:48,854
l wouldn't try to hurt you. You know that.

407
00:43:51,528 --> 00:43:53,462
l guess that's why l've been so mad.

408
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:57,125
lt's because l think
maybe you did what you did because of me.

409
00:43:57,901 --> 00:44:01,496
-Because l was making you so frustrated.
-You weren't.

410
00:44:02,773 --> 00:44:06,072
You were, but you're supposed to.
That's part of being a teenage girl.

411
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:09,702
You're supposed to say no,
and l am supposed to get pissed off.

412
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,912
You make it sound like the '50s.

413
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,178
l guess l'm an old-fashioned guy.

414
00:44:19,056 --> 00:44:21,388
l really want to do it.

415
00:44:22,059 --> 00:44:26,086
That's what's so funny.
l think l want to do it as much as you do.

416
00:44:26,797 --> 00:44:28,628
There's no such thing.

417
00:44:28,899 --> 00:44:31,094
l just have to know l'm ready.

418
00:44:31,468 --> 00:44:34,266
And l'll know. And l swear l'll tell you.

419
00:44:37,107 --> 00:44:38,131
God.

420
00:44:44,815 --> 00:44:47,511
Okay, Sebastian, out of the closet. Now.

421
00:44:48,652 --> 00:44:51,746
l thought l heard noises.
l was checking for prowlers.

422
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:53,823
ln a $100 scarf, perhaps?

423
00:44:53,991 --> 00:44:56,152
You bought it for $49.99.

424
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:02,994
Do you mind if we don't go
barhopping tonight? l'm exhausted.

425
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:05,432
l'm 390 years old.

426
00:45:05,969 --> 00:45:08,164
400, if you're a day.

427
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:12,375
What's the difference?
l'm so old, l can't remember my own sign.

428
00:45:12,643 --> 00:45:17,273
You'll feel much more secure when Mark
has given you your second transfusion.

429
00:45:17,481 --> 00:45:19,472
Life used to be so simple.

430
00:45:20,117 --> 00:45:22,517
All one had to do to get a good meal...

431
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:25,747
was go out in the field
and pick up a shepherd or two.

432
00:45:25,856 --> 00:45:28,552
Remember the look of terror
in a peasant's eyes...

433
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:30,388
when you'd swoop down on him?

434
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:33,828
And plagues.

435
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:37,196
Whole cities infested with rats.

436
00:45:37,701 --> 00:45:40,397
People respected the power of a vampire.

437
00:45:43,507 --> 00:45:46,271
lt's been three days.
Do you think we ought to go find Mark?

438
00:45:46,376 --> 00:45:48,970
Are you suggesting we invade suburbia?

439
00:45:49,947 --> 00:45:52,575
Bowling alleys, RVs...

440
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:54,879
Chicken McNuggets?

441
00:46:23,547 --> 00:46:25,014
A laundromat?

442
00:46:25,382 --> 00:46:28,874
There's no better place
to pick up on lonely, bored women.

443
00:46:28,986 --> 00:46:33,320
You can always tell what you're getting into
by checking out their underwear first.

444
00:46:33,423 --> 00:46:36,722
l swear you guys are insane.
You've lost your minds.

445
00:46:36,827 --> 00:46:40,558
What you know about women would fill
an atom-sized piece of toilet paper.

446
00:46:40,664 --> 00:46:43,326
-Oh, yeah? We'll see.
-All right. We'll see.

447
00:46:43,901 --> 00:46:46,495
-See you later.
-Later. Come on, Jamie.

448
00:46:47,571 --> 00:46:48,765
Come on!

449
00:47:01,218 --> 00:47:03,948
Okay, now remember, you ease over...

450
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:07,188
you check out the hamper...

451
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:09,816
and then make your move, okay?

452
00:47:09,927 --> 00:47:11,690
All right. Let's go.

453
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:14,993
-Wait a minute.
-What?

454
00:47:16,266 --> 00:47:18,097
What do l do if l get lucky?

455
00:47:18,202 --> 00:47:20,898
-Come on, we've been over this 100 times.
-l know.

456
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:23,837
Okay. Do you have enough money
for a motel room?

457
00:47:24,107 --> 00:47:25,005
Yeah.

458
00:47:25,108 --> 00:47:26,575
-You do?
-Yeah.

459
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:29,168
-Okay, do you have protection?
-Yeah.

460
00:47:31,748 --> 00:47:34,148
You intend to invite four friends?

461
00:47:34,918 --> 00:47:37,284
l didn't know what size l'd need.

462
00:47:37,621 --> 00:47:38,952
Try petite.

463
00:47:39,423 --> 00:47:40,822
Now come on.

464
00:47:44,661 --> 00:47:45,992
Come on, Jamie.

465
00:47:46,096 --> 00:47:48,894
-Maybe we should come back later.
-Come on!

466
00:47:53,637 --> 00:47:54,968
-Hi.
-Hello.

467
00:47:56,773 --> 00:47:58,866
l was wondering if you needed any help...

468
00:47:58,976 --> 00:48:01,911
folding your undergarments or anything?

469
00:48:07,651 --> 00:48:08,879
Hi, there.

470
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:12,651
l'm Russ and l'm a Sagittarius.

471
00:48:13,757 --> 00:48:16,851
l enjoy surfing, candlelit dinners,
and Tolstoy.

472
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:23,128
l'm a mature person,
and you're a mature person.

473
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:26,396
So why don't we just skip all the bullshit...

474
00:48:26,803 --> 00:48:28,998
get rid of our inhibitions...

475
00:48:29,506 --> 00:48:32,236
and do what we really want to do?

476
00:48:32,709 --> 00:48:34,336
Sounds good to me.

477
00:48:35,345 --> 00:48:37,040
Why don't we go to your place?

478
00:48:37,147 --> 00:48:40,310
l'll tie you up on your bed.
l'd love to whip you.

479
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:42,578
We can't do it in my bed!

480
00:48:42,719 --> 00:48:46,621
l sleep with my brother,
and he's a chronic bed wetter.

481
00:48:46,957 --> 00:48:48,515
Maybe next time.

482
00:49:01,672 --> 00:49:03,401
-Jamie?
-Hi.

483
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:12,881
-So, how'd it go?
-She said no.

484
00:49:24,594 --> 00:49:27,722
-Hi! Can l help you with something?
-Yes, l'm looking for a skirt.

485
00:49:27,831 --> 00:49:30,698
Something that'll go with a grayish blouse.

486
00:49:31,735 --> 00:49:33,259
Any particular color?

487
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:35,395
-Something in white.
-Okay.

488
00:49:37,074 --> 00:49:39,634
l think l've got just the thing.

489
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:43,643
Here.

490
00:49:44,715 --> 00:49:47,616
-How about something like this?
-l like that.

491
00:49:47,851 --> 00:49:50,285
Good. We also have it in yellow,
if you prefer.

492
00:49:50,387 --> 00:49:51,649
l like the white.

493
00:49:51,755 --> 00:49:55,748
Why don't you try it on in the dressing
room. l'll be with you in just a minute.

494
00:49:55,859 --> 00:49:56,883
Okay.

495
00:49:59,463 --> 00:50:01,158
What are you doing?

496
00:50:01,531 --> 00:50:03,726
-Shopping.
-Really?

497
00:50:03,934 --> 00:50:05,765
Know what l'm shopping for?

498
00:50:05,869 --> 00:50:07,336
-No, what?
-Kisses.

499
00:50:11,141 --> 00:50:12,972
-What?
-You bit my lip!

500
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:14,836
l did?

501
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:17,105
Yeah.

502
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:20,040
You shouldn't be so sweet.

503
00:50:22,152 --> 00:50:24,279
l kind of like these. What do you think?

504
00:50:24,388 --> 00:50:25,719
Check it out.

505
00:50:25,822 --> 00:50:28,723
They're kind of, you know, black.

506
00:50:28,925 --> 00:50:31,416
That's what l like about them.

507
00:50:31,928 --> 00:50:33,793
All right. Try them on.

508
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:42,194
l'll get a sweater that'll lighten up
the black pants a little bit.

509
00:50:42,305 --> 00:50:43,704
-Okay.
-Okay.

510
00:50:57,421 --> 00:50:58,786
Hello, Mark.

511
00:51:03,994 --> 00:51:06,758
What are you doing here?
Where did you come from?

512
00:51:06,863 --> 00:51:08,626
l've been here watching you.

513
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:10,666
l'm always watching you.

514
00:51:12,969 --> 00:51:15,529
Here, try this one. lt's really neat.

515
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:19,568
Baby blue. Wouldn't you know.

516
00:51:19,943 --> 00:51:21,433
Wow! That was quick!

517
00:51:22,312 --> 00:51:23,836
Wait a minute. l see another one.

518
00:51:23,947 --> 00:51:26,108
lf it's pink, l'm gonna puke.

519
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:33,056
Honestly, how can you stand
that little twerp?

520
00:51:33,156 --> 00:51:34,646
She's not a little twerp.

521
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:36,191
l love Robin.

522
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:37,984
And l love Mark.

523
00:51:38,395 --> 00:51:40,454
Would you just leave me alone?

524
00:51:40,564 --> 00:51:43,294
What're you talking about?
You're the one who asked me--

525
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:46,267
Don't come in. l don't have any pants on!

526
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:47,630
Stop it!

527
00:51:48,138 --> 00:51:51,005
l've seen you in your shorts before,
Mark Kendall.

528
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:53,941
Let the little creep in. l don't mind.

529
00:51:54,044 --> 00:51:55,204
l mind.

530
00:51:57,914 --> 00:52:00,348
-Leave me alone!
-l certainly will.

531
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:03,676
Boy, you're acting really weird,
you know that?

532
00:52:10,594 --> 00:52:11,822
Listen...

533
00:52:12,696 --> 00:52:14,721
you got to cool it. l mean it.

534
00:52:14,831 --> 00:52:18,358
You know, you're a very pretty lady.
We had a nice time.

535
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:20,861
But it can't go on forever.

536
00:52:21,738 --> 00:52:24,571
Forever is just what l had in mind.

537
00:52:25,709 --> 00:52:28,371
You don't know what's happening,
do you, Mark?

538
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:31,811
l know if Robin sees us together,
l'm in big trouble.

539
00:52:32,249 --> 00:52:34,717
Don't be such a big baby.

540
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:37,847
Please don't bite my buttons.

541
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:54,129
Are you all right?

542
00:52:59,743 --> 00:53:01,210
What happened?

543
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:03,672
Guess l must have passed out.

544
00:53:04,147 --> 00:53:06,342
Are you sure you're all right?

545
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:09,018
Has this happened before?

546
00:53:10,153 --> 00:53:12,348
Maybe you should see a doctor.

547
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:13,914
Yeah.

548
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:18,422
Let's get out of here.

549
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:21,326
Countess, did you get
your second transfusion?

550
00:53:21,431 --> 00:53:25,128
Of course, and l'll get the third one,
too, despite that girl.

551
00:53:25,402 --> 00:53:28,371
She's got a much stronger hold on him
than l thought.

552
00:53:28,471 --> 00:53:32,032
She's young, she's sweet,
and she's pissing me off.

553
00:54:05,008 --> 00:54:06,600
My God, it lives.

554
00:54:07,444 --> 00:54:09,469
-What time is it?
-8:15.

555
00:54:16,353 --> 00:54:20,449
-Are you feeling better?
-Better than what? l'm feeling fine.

556
00:54:23,193 --> 00:54:25,855
lt's a little bright in here, isn't it?

557
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:31,667
You don't eat right, you know that?

558
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:34,737
l'm making your favorite breakfast,
egg burger.

559
00:54:34,838 --> 00:54:35,964
Great.

560
00:54:38,074 --> 00:54:41,202
-What happened to your shirt?
-Shirt?

561
00:54:41,678 --> 00:54:44,408
The one you wore last night.
All the buttons are gone.

562
00:54:44,514 --> 00:54:47,483
That's the second time.
How'd you manage that?

563
00:54:49,052 --> 00:54:50,986
This jogging crap is for the birds.

564
00:54:51,087 --> 00:54:54,113
lt's really bad
for your knees and your back, Dad.

565
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:56,652
You should have told me that five years ago.

566
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:00,093
-Would you like an egg burger, dear?
-Yes. Thank you.

567
00:55:03,333 --> 00:55:05,392
l'd like to have a little talk with you.

568
00:55:05,902 --> 00:55:07,893
What time is it? l got to go!

569
00:55:08,004 --> 00:55:10,973
-Aren't you going to finish your juice?
-Yeah.

570
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:17,237
See you tonight.

571
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:26,914
He couldn't be anemic.

572
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:29,086
Could he?

573
00:55:38,368 --> 00:55:40,233
-Pushup bar.
-Fudge bar.

574
00:55:55,318 --> 00:55:57,718
-Holy shit!
-Let's get out of here!

575
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:29,945
l'm sorry, Father.

576
00:56:30,353 --> 00:56:31,980
-Have a drink.
-No.

577
00:57:01,151 --> 00:57:04,587
Father, forgive me,
'cause l think l might have sinned.

578
00:57:05,321 --> 00:57:09,087
Last week, l went to a bar in Hollywood...

579
00:57:09,292 --> 00:57:11,226
where l met this strange woman.

580
00:57:12,562 --> 00:57:14,621
She took me to her house...

581
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:17,828
and l think we had a good time.

582
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:21,028
But ever since then,
weird things have been happening.

583
00:57:21,137 --> 00:57:23,196
She keeps following me around!

584
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:25,836
Even in my dreams, she's there...

585
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:29,207
you know, just sort of
screwing around with my life!

586
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:31,277
The worst part...

587
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:35,518
is that l feel like l'm changing.

588
00:57:36,419 --> 00:57:38,512
l do all these funny things.

589
00:57:39,088 --> 00:57:42,489
l frightened a couple of kids
just by looking at them.

590
00:57:45,762 --> 00:57:47,753
l'm starting to freak out.

591
00:57:49,566 --> 00:57:51,966
You're the only one l can turn to.

592
00:57:52,902 --> 00:57:57,271
-What can l do?
-Get yourself a shovel. You're in deep shit.

593
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:29,035
Hello, Mark.

594
00:59:54,123 --> 00:59:55,488
l'm not mad.

595
00:59:55,792 --> 00:59:59,159
l just thought we agreed
that we'd dress alike, that's all.

596
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:02,060
lf l had known
you were going to dress as a vampire--

597
01:00:02,165 --> 01:00:04,429
l'm not dressed like a vampire.

598
01:00:04,567 --> 01:00:07,400
l told you, l couldn't get out
and get a costume today.

599
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:13,208
The point is, l just feel silly
dressed as Jill without Jack.

600
01:00:14,043 --> 01:00:18,070
lf anybody asks, tell them
Jack couldn't get it up after the fall.

601
01:00:18,715 --> 01:00:21,149
-Hi, Robin. Hi, Mark.
-Hi, Suzette.

602
01:00:22,051 --> 01:00:25,817
l love your outfits. Let me take your names
for the best costume contest.

603
01:00:25,922 --> 01:00:26,980
Sure.

604
01:00:28,424 --> 01:00:30,255
Robin Pierce...

605
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:33,619
Jill, sans Jack.

606
01:00:36,032 --> 01:00:38,523
And Mark Kendall...

607
01:00:39,435 --> 01:00:40,629
vampire.

608
01:00:40,937 --> 01:00:42,928
l'm not wearing a costume.

609
01:00:45,842 --> 01:00:47,036
You nut.

610
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:38,885
-Pinocchio, you look great.
-What are you supposed to be?

611
01:01:39,028 --> 01:01:42,429
l was going to be Gandhi,
but l couldn't find glasses or a mustache...

612
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:45,228
so now l'm Yul Brynner.

613
01:01:46,436 --> 01:01:49,769
-That's a great vampire--
-l'm not wearing a costume.

614
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:53,642
l gotta get some punch.

615
01:01:55,178 --> 01:01:57,373
-Hi, Mark.
-Hi, sir.

616
01:05:51,881 --> 01:05:55,510
-Damn that girl!
-lf l've been wrong, revise our plan.

617
01:05:55,618 --> 01:05:58,018
There's more than one way to skin a cat.

618
01:06:49,472 --> 01:06:53,067
Excuse me. May I have your attention
for a moment, pIease?

619
01:06:57,713 --> 01:07:00,147
Thank you. I'm pIeased to announce...

620
01:07:00,249 --> 01:07:03,377
that the winner
of the best-costume contest is...

621
01:07:03,819 --> 01:07:06,344
Mark KendaII as a vampire!

622
01:07:08,124 --> 01:07:10,285
l'm not wearing a costume!

623
01:07:29,979 --> 01:07:32,470
-Robin.
-What happened?

624
01:07:32,948 --> 01:07:35,280
l'm sorry, l don't know what came over me.

625
01:07:35,384 --> 01:07:39,844
lt was just.... All those kids were
yelling and screaming and freaking out.

626
01:07:40,222 --> 01:07:43,020
They were just glad for you that you won.

627
01:07:43,259 --> 01:07:45,853
l know. lt's just.... l don't know.

628
01:07:46,262 --> 01:07:48,560
lt just felt weird for a second.

629
01:08:02,778 --> 01:08:06,111
-Mark! What is it?
-Look! l'm not there!

630
01:08:08,617 --> 01:08:09,675
Look!

631
01:08:17,059 --> 01:08:19,619
l swear, l wasn't there a minute ago.

632
01:08:21,397 --> 01:08:23,388
lt's her. lt's that woman.

633
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:26,595
The one that bit your buttons?

634
01:08:28,304 --> 01:08:32,104
l think she's a vampire,
and l think she's turning me into one.

635
01:08:32,541 --> 01:08:34,600
Turning you into a vampire?

636
01:08:34,810 --> 01:08:38,803
That's why l couldn't see myself.
Vampires don't have a reflection.

637
01:08:38,914 --> 01:08:41,109
But you're there. See?

638
01:08:42,051 --> 01:08:43,416
Oh, my God!

639
01:08:47,690 --> 01:08:48,918
Vampires?

640
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:53,692
Vampires? Did you say....

641
01:08:54,864 --> 01:08:57,958
Yes! Do l have some books on vampires!

642
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:01,028
Goodness gracious! Just follow me.

643
01:09:01,704 --> 01:09:03,672
You know, it is most unfortunate...

644
01:09:03,772 --> 01:09:07,469
the shocking reputation
that vampires are having these days.

645
01:09:07,910 --> 01:09:11,073
You know, most people
are basing their opinions...

646
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:13,840
on those silly vampire movies.

647
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:16,283
What is this doing here?

648
01:09:16,385 --> 01:09:18,410
ls there such a thing as a female vampire?

649
01:09:18,521 --> 01:09:22,582
But of course. The result of a vampire bite,
just the same as any other vampire.

650
01:09:22,691 --> 01:09:25,353
You know, there are even cases
of cat and dog vampires.

651
01:09:25,461 --> 01:09:29,090
Don't worry about it. The cleaning lady
will fix it when she comes next week.

652
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:33,225
As l was saying, cat and dog vampires.
And l even remember, once in the 1960s...

653
01:09:33,335 --> 01:09:35,462
a gerbil was bitten in the hind leg--

654
01:09:35,571 --> 01:09:38,301
Could a woman vampire
actually exist today?

655
01:09:38,641 --> 01:09:40,438
Like, maybe in Hollywood?

656
01:09:40,543 --> 01:09:45,173
That's the ideal place.
You see, she can blend in with the crowd.

657
01:09:45,714 --> 01:09:48,410
Could one of these lady vampires
actually bite a guy?

658
01:09:48,517 --> 01:09:50,280
You know, like, a teenage guy?

659
01:09:50,386 --> 01:09:53,480
-How old would he be?
-Like, 18.

660
01:09:53,856 --> 01:09:55,414
l seriously doubt it.

661
01:09:55,524 --> 01:09:58,891
You see, the female vampire
needs the blood of a virgin.

662
01:09:58,994 --> 01:10:02,623
And an 18-year-old boy
would hardly be a virgin, now, would he?

663
01:10:02,731 --> 01:10:05,700
Just hypothetically, what if he was a virgin?

664
01:10:07,736 --> 01:10:11,695
Then l think he has a lot bigger problems
to worry about than female vampires.

665
01:10:13,943 --> 01:10:16,207
lf he got bitten, how would you know?

666
01:10:16,579 --> 01:10:21,039
You would then just look for a bite
on the inside of the thigh...

667
01:10:21,483 --> 01:10:25,180
like this one, piercing the artery.

668
01:10:25,854 --> 01:10:28,914
Apparently, attacks so close
to the source of....

669
01:10:29,258 --> 01:10:32,489
ln the case of a virgin,
untapped sexual potency...

670
01:10:32,795 --> 01:10:36,697
is what the woman vampire needs
to retain her youth and beauty.

671
01:10:37,533 --> 01:10:41,833
l have over here, somewhere,
a book of plates showing color....

672
01:10:43,038 --> 01:10:44,164
Hello?

673
01:10:46,275 --> 01:10:47,333
Goodness gracious.

674
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:54,045
Wait up! l have to talk to you about Mark.

675
01:10:54,383 --> 01:10:57,375
-What's going on?
-Mark's been acting strange lately.

676
01:10:57,486 --> 01:10:59,852
-Don't we all?
-But l did some research...

677
01:10:59,955 --> 01:11:04,483
and what l found out is that Mark
may have contracted some sort of disease.

678
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:07,524
-Like a venereal disease?
-Sort of.

679
01:11:10,666 --> 01:11:13,430
But l need you guys to find out for sure.

680
01:11:15,704 --> 01:11:17,672
What do you want us to do?

681
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:21,367
l need you to check his inner thigh
for two little sores.

682
01:11:24,046 --> 01:11:25,013
Sores?

683
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:26,877
-l don't know.
-Yeah.

684
01:11:27,549 --> 01:11:30,074
l thought Mark meant something to you.

685
01:11:30,185 --> 01:11:32,676
lf you're really his friends, you'll do this.

686
01:12:05,954 --> 01:12:08,184
All right, we still on for tomorrow night?

687
01:12:13,028 --> 01:12:14,393
l need soap.

688
01:12:24,139 --> 01:12:27,631
The water is too cold!
l need hot water over here.

689
01:13:05,247 --> 01:13:06,839
Now, Jamie, look!

690
01:13:09,785 --> 01:13:11,548
What the hell are you guys doing?

691
01:13:11,653 --> 01:13:13,348
Fags in the shower!

692
01:13:13,956 --> 01:13:15,617
Fag alert!

693
01:13:22,931 --> 01:13:24,057
Great!

694
01:13:27,236 --> 01:13:28,828
This is terrible.

695
01:13:31,039 --> 01:13:32,973
l can't believe this happened.

696
01:13:33,075 --> 01:13:36,135
lt's the most humiliating experience
of my life.

697
01:13:37,713 --> 01:13:39,180
This is awful.

698
01:13:40,482 --> 01:13:43,280
This is the suckiest thing
that could ever happen.

699
01:13:43,385 --> 01:13:45,945
The whole school thinks we're gay.

700
01:13:46,655 --> 01:13:50,523
Don't be such a twerp.
Our past histories speak for themselves.

701
01:13:50,626 --> 01:13:53,720
-No one's gonna think we're gay.
-l don't have a past history.

702
01:13:53,829 --> 01:13:56,297
And neither do you. This is it.

703
01:13:56,799 --> 01:13:59,700
We might as well move in together
and get his-and-his towels.

704
01:13:59,802 --> 01:14:02,293
Who cares what those assholes think?

705
01:14:08,444 --> 01:14:11,470
What were they doing in the showers
in the first place?

706
01:14:11,580 --> 01:14:13,241
They were washing.

707
01:14:13,348 --> 01:14:15,908
We were enacting a prison rape scene.

708
01:14:34,169 --> 01:14:37,036
What was that scene in the shower
all about?

709
01:14:37,606 --> 01:14:40,370
That's the thanks l get
for trying to help out a friend?

710
01:14:40,476 --> 01:14:42,774
You're a big help. Thanks a lot.

711
01:14:44,746 --> 01:14:48,705
Did it ever occur to you guys
that maybe you could have asked me?

712
01:14:51,553 --> 01:14:54,215
-Oh, my God!
-She told us to look!

713
01:14:54,323 --> 01:14:57,952
-l knew it. We enjoyed it.
-Jamie, would you shut up?

714
01:14:58,060 --> 01:15:00,528
No, that's it. We're homos.
We're rump rangers.

715
01:15:00,629 --> 01:15:01,618
No!

716
01:15:05,267 --> 01:15:06,734
What the hell?

717
01:16:08,964 --> 01:16:11,660
Why don't you shoot off a cannon? Jesus.

718
01:16:15,704 --> 01:16:17,035
Be careful.

719
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:21,732
-My stomach is starting to gurgle.
-Will you shut up?

720
01:16:24,813 --> 01:16:26,906
God! Come on!

721
01:17:03,485 --> 01:17:05,419
l got to go to the bathroom.

722
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:08,011
-Tough shit.
-Tie it off, man.

723
01:17:14,596 --> 01:17:16,154
l think l'm gonna be sick.

724
01:17:16,264 --> 01:17:19,233
Goddamn it, will you forget
your function for five minutes?

725
01:17:19,334 --> 01:17:22,565
l can't! This always happens to me
when l'm scared.

726
01:17:26,575 --> 01:17:27,633
Wait.

727
01:17:30,312 --> 01:17:31,404
Help!

728
01:17:35,183 --> 01:17:36,616
Are you okay?

729
01:17:40,422 --> 01:17:42,686
Why did you go with that creep?

730
01:17:44,026 --> 01:17:46,358
''l needed you.'' That's all he said?

731
01:17:46,862 --> 01:17:48,227
l got to go.

732
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:50,890
The sooner we get her loose,
the sooner you're gonna.

733
01:17:50,999 --> 01:17:52,990
Work on her feet. Come on!

734
01:17:56,171 --> 01:17:57,297
Sorry.

735
01:17:57,973 --> 01:18:01,101
Mark, you're still a virgin.
She never made love to you.

736
01:18:01,209 --> 01:18:04,337
She just took your blood from....You know.

737
01:18:06,381 --> 01:18:08,349
Can't l have any privacy?

738
01:18:09,918 --> 01:18:12,682
-l hate this whole thing.
-Come on.

739
01:18:28,370 --> 01:18:29,837
Quiet, please.

740
01:18:31,039 --> 01:18:33,269
Gentlemen and ladies...

741
01:18:34,109 --> 01:18:37,044
welcome to this most auspicious occasion.

742
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:40,838
And now for the unveiling.

743
01:19:14,883 --> 01:19:16,942
Okay. That's not funny now.

744
01:19:19,788 --> 01:19:21,346
Guys, l mean....

745
01:19:24,226 --> 01:19:26,194
All right. Now l'm angry.

746
01:19:39,141 --> 01:19:40,267
Great.

747
01:19:40,909 --> 01:19:42,433
Dearest Mark...

748
01:19:42,544 --> 01:19:46,412
twice, we have shared a mystical experience.

749
01:19:48,183 --> 01:19:51,311
Tonight, the holy third!

750
01:19:51,686 --> 01:19:53,017
Hear, hear.

751
01:19:59,427 --> 01:20:01,793
Please don't bite the buttons off this jacket.

752
01:20:01,897 --> 01:20:05,424
lt belongs to my father.
Besides, you might chip a tooth.

753
01:20:06,468 --> 01:20:08,561
They'll hardly bother these.

754
01:20:09,638 --> 01:20:12,698
l don't want to be a vampire.
l'm a day person.

755
01:20:44,372 --> 01:20:47,068
Move away from him! Up against the wall!

756
01:20:52,814 --> 01:20:56,011
Mark, it's me, Robin. Do you remember?

757
01:20:57,219 --> 01:20:59,585
We've known each other forever and ever.

758
01:20:59,688 --> 01:21:00,780
Mark!

759
01:21:03,091 --> 01:21:07,494
l'm the owner of the pants you've been
trying to get into for the last four years.

760
01:21:07,963 --> 01:21:09,487
-Robin?
-Yes.

761
01:21:11,499 --> 01:21:14,366
How would you like your crotch set on fire?

762
01:21:14,836 --> 01:21:16,201
Rough trade.

763
01:21:17,372 --> 01:21:18,669
Stand back!

764
01:21:18,773 --> 01:21:20,468
Put down the cross.

765
01:21:20,575 --> 01:21:22,065
lt only works in movies.

766
01:21:22,177 --> 01:21:24,111
Besides, l'm an atheist.

767
01:21:24,446 --> 01:21:26,812
Fire, on the other hand....

768
01:21:33,622 --> 01:21:34,850
Back off!

769
01:21:36,024 --> 01:21:37,218
Come on!

770
01:21:56,945 --> 01:21:58,810
l can be yours, Mark...

771
01:21:59,781 --> 01:22:00,975
forever...

772
01:22:02,751 --> 01:22:05,549
showing you joys
you never dreamed possible...

773
01:22:06,688 --> 01:22:09,714
in your most fevered adolescent slumber.

774
01:22:11,593 --> 01:22:14,824
Mark doesn't want you,
because you're mean and evil.

775
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:18,161
He wants me,
because l'm nice and sweet and pure.

776
01:22:18,366 --> 01:22:19,731
So fuck off!

777
01:22:22,203 --> 01:22:23,830
After that virgin!

778
01:22:24,539 --> 01:22:25,767
Come on!

779
01:22:30,578 --> 01:22:33,240
-Run!
-Are you crazy? They'll kill you.

780
01:22:33,348 --> 01:22:36,215
They want you, not us. We'll hold them off.

781
01:22:36,351 --> 01:22:37,943
-We will?
-Go!

782
01:22:42,023 --> 01:22:44,082
See you in school tomorrow.

783
01:22:51,866 --> 01:22:54,733
-Hurry up!
-Can l put my pants on?

784
01:22:59,341 --> 01:23:00,638
Holy shit.

785
01:23:18,059 --> 01:23:19,549
All right, they're not here.

786
01:23:19,661 --> 01:23:22,630
You come with us.
The rest of you go that way.

787
01:23:41,149 --> 01:23:42,275
Hello.

788
01:23:43,518 --> 01:23:45,509
Look what got left behind.

789
01:23:47,288 --> 01:23:50,314
Could one of you please show me
where the bathroom is?

790
01:23:54,629 --> 01:23:56,563
Don't let them get away!

791
01:24:02,604 --> 01:24:04,663
-We'll go back this way.
-But--

792
01:24:04,773 --> 01:24:07,936
Trust me, we've got them
right where we want them.

793
01:24:24,793 --> 01:24:26,124
After them!

794
01:24:41,176 --> 01:24:42,871
You bungling idiot!

795
01:24:43,011 --> 01:24:47,107
l'm a mature person,
and you're a mature person.

796
01:24:47,415 --> 01:24:50,384
So why don't we just skip all the bullshit...

797
01:24:50,652 --> 01:24:55,146
get rid of our inhibitions,
and do what we really want to do.

798
01:25:28,490 --> 01:25:30,355
l could have done that.

799
01:25:31,726 --> 01:25:35,890
l haven't had this much fun since,
like, Haight-Ashbury.

800
01:25:41,002 --> 01:25:42,060
So...

801
01:25:43,438 --> 01:25:45,269
what should we do now?

802
01:26:17,972 --> 01:26:20,566
You stay here. We'll go the other way.

803
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:26,913
Get those doors.

804
01:26:27,015 --> 01:26:28,744
Hurry. Get that one.

805
01:26:49,137 --> 01:26:50,604
Wait a minute!

806
01:26:51,306 --> 01:26:53,934
l have to replace every door
you people smash.

807
01:26:54,042 --> 01:26:57,068
-Can't you at least try the knob first?
-Jocks.

808
01:27:50,732 --> 01:27:52,290
You're too late.

809
01:27:53,868 --> 01:27:57,065
You couldn't have.
You've been in there less than a minute.

810
01:28:03,645 --> 01:28:05,237
You could have...

811
01:28:06,114 --> 01:28:08,674
but you didn't have time to enjoy it.

812
01:28:12,053 --> 01:28:13,611
What time is it?

813
01:28:14,289 --> 01:28:15,517
Midnight.

814
01:28:30,171 --> 01:28:32,765
Somebody get a plastic surgeon. Quick!

815
01:28:34,008 --> 01:28:35,566
l need a virgin!

816
01:28:50,425 --> 01:28:52,256
Countess, don't worry.

817
01:28:52,660 --> 01:28:55,060
There are other virgins out there.

818
01:28:56,197 --> 01:28:59,860
Somewhere, in places like Kansas....

819
01:29:00,868 --> 01:29:02,096
Nebraska.

820
01:29:07,508 --> 01:29:09,772
l'll never find another virgin.

821
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:12,038
Never!

822
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:14,478
Now, now. l'll take care of you.

823
01:29:15,616 --> 01:29:17,550
There's always tomorrow.

824
01:29:19,654 --> 01:29:21,815
You know, maybe the Countess is right.

825
01:29:21,923 --> 01:29:23,914
lt would be better slower.

826
01:29:25,660 --> 01:29:27,150
Let's find out.

827
01:29:31,165 --> 01:29:33,531
l believe l've created a monster.
