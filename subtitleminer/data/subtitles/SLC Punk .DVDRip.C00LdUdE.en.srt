00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:35,224
The thing about me and Bob,
and pretty much all of us, was...

2
00:00:35,301 --> 00:00:38,293
we hated rednecks
more than anything else, period.

3
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:40,839
Because rednecks for us
were America incarnate.

4
00:00:40,907 --> 00:00:44,070
And America? Huh.
Well, fuck America!

5
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,490
So, hey,
what do you wanna do now?

6
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:10,832
Let's score. I gotta get some pelt
tonight or my balls are gonna drop oft.

7
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,838
I hear that.

8
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,839
Come on, cowboy!

9
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,845
Come on!

10
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:29,385
What can I say? We weren't much more
than a couple of young punks.

11
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:08,018
Good morning, Bob.
Rise and shine.

12
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:10,681
It's a beautitul fucking day.

13
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:13,317
All right.

14
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:15,327
Two more hours.

15
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,064
But that's it.

16
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:33,138
To be an anarchist in Salt Lake City
was certainly no easy task...

17
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,408
especially in 1985.

18
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:37,915
And having no money, no job...

19
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:39,918
no plans for the future...

20
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:44,150
the true anarchist position was,
in itself, a strenuous job.

21
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:47,216
And our tribe was small.
I mean, at the center was me, Stevo...

22
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:49,591
and Bob, my roommate...
Heroin Bob.

23
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:53,393
Oh, Bob didn't really do heroin.
In fact, he hated needles.

24
00:03:58,471 --> 00:04:00,405
Bob's irrational fear of needles...

25
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:02,668
was in contrast to everything
you'd think about the guy.

26
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:06,075
I mean, to look at him, you'd think
he was a madman, which he was.

27
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:08,943
But he was also one
of the most uptight guys I've ever met.

28
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:24,494
He didn't do anything
about the cut on his hand... nothing.

29
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:26,896
I mean, absolutely nothing.
He just wrapped it up...

30
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:30,094
in a dirty old T-shirt,
and he left it like that for weeks.

31
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:38,908
Is he gonna be okay?

32
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:44,109
Oh, yeah. He'll be tine.
I'm sure. Thank you, though.

33
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:52,054
Hi, how are we doing?

34
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:55,094
Okay. Can I take a look at that?

35
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:57,356
Okay. All right.

36
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,266
Oh, what the heck did we do here?

37
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:05,827
I think that wound's
the most intected thing I've ever seen.

38
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:08,999
I hate doctors, man.
I hate 'em.

39
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:11,407
Well, you're lucky those boys
brought you here.

40
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:14,640
Okay? Because without me
you'd be dead.

41
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:18,707
Patty, we need
a gram ot amoxicillin.

42
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:30,023
That's a nasty cut you've got there.
How did you manage that?

43
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:32,326
I fell ott my bike.

44
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:34,662
Oh, sweetheart, I'm sorry.
Does it still hurt?

45
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:44,909
- That's a nice kid.
- Yeah, sad, really.

46
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:47,912
- How's that?
- Kids.

47
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,676
There's not much future
tor 'em, hmm?

48
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:54,219
We all die, Stevo.

49
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:59,252
That's true.
Very true, Mike.

50
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:02,260
No, no! No, I'm tine! I'm tine!

51
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:04,262
Get that fucking needle
away trom me, man!

52
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:08,096
No, I don't do needles!
Get ott me! Get otf!

53
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:13,036
Goddamn it! No! No!

54
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:14,937
You pack of murderers! No!

55
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:16,440
No needles!

56
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:18,739
Help me! Help me!
No, no, please!

57
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:21,644
So Heroin Bob was named as such
'cause he was afraid of needles.

58
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:24,683
But not just needles.
The guy was afraid of drugs too.

59
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:27,242
We couldn't even get him
to take a damn aspirin.

60
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,756
He drank, and he smoked cigarettes
but that's it. He'd say...

61
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:33,849
You know that shit you guys do?
You're fucking yourselves up, man.

62
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:36,554
Fucking acid. Acid.
It never leaves your body.

63
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:39,063
It's in your tuckin'
spinal cord torever.

64
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:42,795
Let me tell you something
about the nature of chemicals, man.

65
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:45,235
You know that dude Napoleon?

66
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:47,704
He was banished to an island
when the French got sick of him.

67
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:50,971
That's right. He supposedly died
ot stomach problems, right?

68
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:54,979
Wrong. He was actually poisoned
over a long period ot time.

69
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:57,777
Murdered by arsenic,
a preservative.

70
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,442
- And you know how?
- No idea.

71
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,645
- His hair.
- His hair?

72
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,449
His fuckin' hair.
It was arsenic.

73
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:04,888
You could tell how long
he was being poisoned...

74
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:08,120
by following the traces
of poison up his hair.

75
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:12,153
Dude, dude, dude, it you do
enough hits of it, you're dead.

76
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:16,330
- It really makes you think, doesn't it?
- Think what?

77
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:19,337
That chemistry's the wrong
fucking major tor a guy like you.

78
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:22,636
- It's the wrong major, Bob.
- You should lay oft the acid anyways!

79
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,801
- You heard about Sean, right?
- No, what happened to Sean?

80
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:26,640
You know he was selling acid, right?

81
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:30,876
No, man. I told you $25, man.
$25. It's inflation.

82
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,508
Shit's getting expensive, man.

83
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:34,450
- Thanks, man.
- No problem.

84
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,283
- Nice spikes.
- Nice tuckin' suit.

85
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,090
Let me ask you something, Sean.

86
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:41,524
What the tuck
did you become a punk tor?

87
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:44,859
Hey, man. Come on. The kid wants
to be a punk, let him be a punk.

88
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:47,832
You see, Russ.

89
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,334
Mods are pussies, man.
That shit's tuckin' dead.

90
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:52,337
If we catch you out tonight,
we're kickin' your ass.

91
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:55,636
- Come on. He's all right.
- Kickin' my ass? Kick my ass?

92
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,871
- Come on. Let's go.
- Get on your bikes and ride away.

93
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:03,143
- Hey, tuck you!
- No, thanks, sweetheart. All right.

94
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:04,945
Your mom's driving us
to soccer practice?

95
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:06,848
- 4:00.
- You guys enjoy.

96
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:13,552
So Sean puts all this acid
in his pocket, and the school cop...

97
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:15,719
- Where was this?
- Southeast High, man.

98
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:17,820
So he takes off running...

99
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:20,525
and he's running through
the track field...

100
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,160
and the sprinklers are on.

101
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:39,650
So the water
soaks through his pants...

102
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:42,119
and melts the acid
which went through his pants...

103
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,053
onto the skin on his leg.

104
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:46,591
So you know,
over a hundred hits of acid...

105
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:48,786
dissolved into Sean's leg.

106
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,658
Fried him.

107
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,322
So I went to see him
a week later.

108
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:56,334
It had just snowed,
and he was sitting outside in the cold.

109
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:02,031
What are you doin' outside, man?

110
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:03,700
Are you him?

111
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:08,174
- Yeah, I'm him.
- Jesus!

112
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:10,181
Have I sinned,
or am I going to heaven?

113
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:14,052
You're tryin', man.

114
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,578
- How much acid did you take?
- Wait. You're not Jesus.

115
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:22,617
- You're Bob.
- I'm Bob! How goes it?

116
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:27,090
- How are you doing that?
- Doin' what?

117
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:31,193
Walkin' on water. It I get ott this
chair, I'll drown. Wanna know why?

118
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:34,706
- 'Cause I can't swim.
- Oh, I get it.

119
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:37,709
So, Sean,
do you see land anywhere?

120
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:45,917
Just water.

121
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:49,387
- Say, Bob?
- Yeah.

122
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:53,787
You are Jesus.

123
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:57,659
That's right. I am.
Why do you ask?

124
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:03,401
Satan is in the house.

125
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:05,460
He killed my mom...

126
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:08,473
and turned her into a bull.

127
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:11,999
Oh, I didn't hear you come in!

128
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:15,343
- What? What?
- Come here.

129
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:17,109
I gotta kill her!

130
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:19,117
Okay! Hold still!

131
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:50,478
Put your hands in the air
and slowly turn around.

132
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:54,451
- I'm saved! I'm saved!
- Put your hands up!

133
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,454
Yeah, sure, Sean.
You're saved.

134
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:58,752
I said put your hands in the air.

135
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:04,685
Chemicals, man.
They'll fuck you up.

136
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:07,198
I always wondered what happened
to that crazy little shit.

137
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:09,393
It's a crazy tucked-up world...

138
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:11,698
and we're all just barely
floatin' along...

139
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:15,502
waitin' for somebody
that can walk on water.

140
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:17,804
Bob was like that...

141
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:20,277
a real asshole when it came
to reading into things.

142
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:24,544
He liked to wrap things up into neat
little packages that implied the world.

143
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:26,346
See, Sean was fucked up.

144
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:28,751
Not the world.
The world was just confused.

145
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:31,551
And not the world, really.
Just the people in it.

146
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:35,025
Bob was confused.
And more, Bob was paranoid as fuck.

147
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:37,494
That's right.
Bob was in quarantine.

148
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:40,123
The doctor said that Bob's infection
was so bad...

149
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,133
that it had become a lethal virus.

150
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,226
And so he was under quarantine
for some weeks.

151
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:47,431
It was the beginning of the fall
and the rest of our lives.

152
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:54,738
We both graduated college
and were taking summer classes...

153
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:58,272
a major feat, since our aim in college
was to be as destructive as possible.

154
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:01,683
Our mission, after leaving high school
as two aspiring young punks...

155
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:04,416
I think the only two punks
in Salt Lake City at the time...

156
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:07,323
was to go to university
and bring down the system.

157
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,418
Why? Well, for obvious reasons.

158
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:13,192
Anarchy... the only system of government
that seemed to make any sense to us.

159
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:16,462
And the irony was we had made it
through. I did well, even.

160
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:20,767
My father was hell-bent on getting me to
go to Harvard Law School, like he did.

161
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,707
My father tried to get me to go
right after I graduated high school.

162
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:25,835
Thank you for giving us
an hour ot your time.

163
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:29,039
Your mother and I tound this
to be rather important.

164
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:33,213
You finished high school.

165
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:36,914
Thank God.
And now it's your time to do good.

166
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:39,753
This rebellion thing
you're going through, I understand it.

167
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:43,261
Not completely,
but I respect it.

168
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:45,661
Now you should think about
what is right for you.

169
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:49,189
I mean, be free, darling, always.

170
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:53,271
Yeah. Be practical, Steve.

171
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:57,366
You got a chance to go to Harvard.
You've got me as an alumnus.

172
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,377
- That can't hurt.
- But only it it makes you happy.

173
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:02,676
Look, if you want to rebel there,
you can do it. I went to Woodstock.

174
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:05,273
Me and the guys had a lot ot fun.
We did our thing there.

175
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:07,615
We got behind some causes, though.

176
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:09,677
We tought tor some
very strong causes.

177
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:13,691
We ended, collectively,
we ended that goddamn war in 'Nam...

178
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:15,693
so that guys like you
could be tree.

179
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:18,787
There's all these possibilities
for you, Steven. Carry the torch now.

180
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:21,298
Okay? I can see by looking at you
that you're ready.

181
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:23,995
- I'm proud that you're an individual.
- Very proud.

182
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:26,003
So proud.

183
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:28,005
One thing.

184
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:30,940
This may not be easy to hear,
but the hair.

185
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,604
Maybe tone it down a bit.
The whole thing that you're doing.

186
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:37,308
In my day, it was long hair,
beatniks, paisley.

187
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:39,578
You know. That stuft.

188
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:42,985
Not like that kind of thing.
This whole thing you're doing...

189
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:45,285
this statement about
the American Indian...

190
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:47,382
I'm baftled.
And not just me.

191
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:49,791
A regular guy in the street's
gonna be baftled too.

192
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:51,796
And we're hip, we're cool.

193
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:55,459
It's just those guys on the east coast
are never gonna get it.

194
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:57,900
They're not gonna get this
in New York.

195
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:01,963
- Darling, we sound like our parents.
- Yeah.

196
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,973
- It's ditficult, dear.
- We just want to support you.

197
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:09,481
A hundred percent. Take the ball
and run with it. Make a difterence.

198
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:13,006
But always with love.
Remember that, Steven.

199
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:16,418
- Always with love.
- Oh, time out.

200
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:19,855
I just want to ask real quick,
it I can.

201
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:22,553
You believe in rebellion,
treedom and love, right?

202
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:25,563
- Absolutely. Yes.
- Rebellion, freedom, love.

203
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:29,393
You two are divorced,
so love tailed.

204
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:33,370
Two: Mom, you're a New Ager, clinging to
any kind ot scrap ot eastern religion...

205
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:36,602
that may justify
why the above said love failed.

206
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:39,405
Three: Dad, you're a slick,
corporate, preppy-ass lawyer.

207
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:42,379
I don't really have to say
anything else about you, do I?

208
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:44,746
Four: You moved
from New York City...

209
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:49,345
the Mecca and hub of the cultural world,
to Utah... nowhere...

210
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:51,389
to change nothing...
more to perpetuate...

211
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:54,187
this cycle of money, greed,
fascism and triviality.

212
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:58,856
Your movement ot, by and for the people
got you nothing.

213
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:02,628
You just hide behind some lost sense
ot drugs, sex, rock and roll.

214
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:04,396
Ooh, Kumbaya.

215
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:07,633
I am the tuture.
I am the future of this great nation...

216
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:11,107
which you, Father,
so arrogantly saved this world tor.

217
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:13,269
Look. I have my own agenda.

218
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:16,314
Harvard, out.
University ot Utah, in.

219
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:19,874
I'm going to get a 4.0 in damage.
I love you guys.

220
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:22,853
Don't get me wrong.
It's all about this.

221
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,947
But for the tirst time
in my life, I'm 18...

222
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:29,324
and I can say, "Fuck you!"

223
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:34,595
Steven, I didn't sell out, son.
I bought in.

224
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:36,294
Keep that in mind.

225
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:39,928
That kid is gonna make
one hell of a lawyer, huh?

226
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:43,133
Yeah, he takes atter his tather.

227
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:45,142
He's a son of a bitch.

228
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:47,644
Fuck you, dear.

229
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:55,950
And now, four years later,
I was a college graduate.

230
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:59,149
We did what we could to fuck things up,
but the system is strong...

231
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:01,249
and they were many
and we were still few.

232
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:03,488
But this fall
was gonna be the fall, all right.

233
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:07,123
Bob and the rest of us had made an oath
to do absolutely nothing.

234
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,760
We were gonna waste our educated minds.
We had no other way of fighting.

235
00:16:10,836 --> 00:16:13,100
As I said,
there just weren't enough of us.

236
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:28,018
Sure, there was a lot more punks
than there was four years earlier...

237
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:29,645
but there was also as many posers.

238
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:34,591
Posers were people that looked like
punks, but they did it for fashion.

239
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:38,152
And they were fools.
They'd say, "Anarchy in the U.K."

240
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:42,428
You see? Posers.
"Anarchy in the U.K."

241
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:43,991
What the tuck's that?

242
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:46,435
What good is that to those ot us
in Utah, America?

243
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:49,770
It was a Sex Pistols thing, right? They
were trom England. They were British.

244
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:53,369
That's what they did. They were allowed
to go on about anarchy in the U.K.

245
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:56,243
You don't live your lite by lyrics.

246
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:58,408
I mean, that's all you ever heard
trom these trendy fucks.

247
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:02,284
Like, "Did you hear the new
Smiths album? It's fuckin' territ."

248
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:05,983
Kids walking around Utah saying "terrif"
with a stupid old English twang.

249
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:08,891
See what I mean? What the fuck's up
with the England bullshit?

250
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:10,986
You know Jag? He's a tag.

251
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:14,362
I knew a girl who'd only have sex
with a guy if he had a fucking accent.

252
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:16,367
Can you think ot anything
more ludicrous?

253
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:18,369
So every asshole
in Salt Lake City...

254
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:21,065
and let me tell you, plenty ot assholes
in this general region...

255
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,131
that wanted to do some ot this,
would get her drunk...

256
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,233
and put on some kind
ot stupid accent...

257
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:29,041
like, "Hey, mistress,
do you tancy a shag?"

258
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:31,048
And there she would...
tucking knees in the sky.

259
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:33,949
It was sad. It made me really sad.
Poor girl had no self-respect.

260
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:38,888
To me, England was nothing more
than a big American state...

261
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:41,892
like North Dakota or Canada.

262
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:46,192
You gotta look at me and say, "Hey,
why are you so mad?" And I'll tell you.

263
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:49,257
'Cause tor all the fawning that
went over the English bands in S.L. C...

264
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:52,098
those tuckin' English chaps
could only say shit about us Americans.

265
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:54,105
All we were to them
was a bunch ot hicks.

266
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:56,641
Well, you know what?
I'm not a fuckin' hick!

267
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:59,142
I don't wear cowboy boots.
I hate the fuckin' rodeo.

268
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:01,145
Horses smell like shit to me...

269
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:03,147
and I don't tuck anyone
in my own bloodline.

270
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:06,480
By detinition, I'm not a redneck,
and I ain't a fuckin' hick.

271
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:08,918
Oh, the sun never sets
on the British empire.

272
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:11,888
Well, the sun never sets
on my asshole!

273
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:15,324
Another thing that pissed me off,
talking about who started punk rock.

274
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:17,885
Was it Sex Pistols in England?

275
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:20,955
Was it the Ramones
and the Velvet Underground in New York?

276
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:23,467
Is it the Ramones?
Is it the Sex Pistols?

277
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:26,971
Who cares who started it?
It's music.

278
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,337
I don't know who started it,
and I don't give a tuck.

279
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:32,468
The one thing I do know
is that we did it harder...

280
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:38,176
goddamn it, we did it faster, and we
definitely did it with more love, baby!

281
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,184
You can't take that away from us.

282
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:42,186
Exhibit A.

283
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:46,317
It's my only exhibit,
really, but, you know what?

284
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:48,325
I think it's pretty tuckin' good.

285
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:50,787
Fuck oft and die.

286
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:54,162
One of these days it's got to go
One of these days I'm comin' out slow

287
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:57,498
One of these days we'll all be bored
One of these days I'm comin' out strong

288
00:18:57,569 --> 00:19:00,970
One of these days it's got to go
One of these days I'm comin' out strong

289
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,973
One of these days, yeah

290
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:22,186
It you were a tuckin' man,
you'd fuck me here!

291
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:25,321
I said it you were a fuckin' man,
you'd tuck me here, right here, now!

292
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:38,842
Fuckers.

293
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:44,540
Hey, wasn't she with you?

294
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:47,176
- Who?
- Um, Sandy.

295
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:49,849
Last week, dude.

296
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:54,018
We hung out, but nobody's anybody's.
Anyway, I got my eye on Trish.

297
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:56,322
Hey, where is Trish?
I have to talk to her.

298
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:58,590
She's setting up tor the after party
for the band.

299
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:00,894
Hey, isn't Trish,
like, 30-somethin'?

300
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:03,230
Yeah, dude.
She's fuckin' smart as hell too.

301
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:05,566
I can listen to her talk tor,
like, hours.

302
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:08,629
Yeah. That's good tor you
'cause all she ever does is talk.

303
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:19,211
I see Stevo
is getting along tonight.

304
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:21,885
I gotta do somethin'.

305
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:45,909
So, Mark,
how are you doin', old man?

306
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:49,504
Fuck!

307
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,071
I'm not old, motherfucker.

308
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:54,812
Oh, no. I just... You know, I mean,
you're older than anyone else here.

309
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:57,218
It depends on how you look at it.

310
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:59,382
I'm young in my heart...

311
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:02,427
younger than any ot these sad souls
over there.

312
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:08,291
You know, Bob...
he's always looking tor pain.

313
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:10,665
That's why I don't understand
you Americans.

314
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:12,397
You're always looking tor pain.

315
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:15,804
Yeah, well, you know what?
It pains me to hear you say that, Mark.

316
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:17,899
It really does.

317
00:21:33,892 --> 00:21:35,553
Hold these.

318
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:37,527
More pain you're looking for?

319
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:39,530
No, I have to go take care
ot something.

320
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:58,676
- Hey, that's Bob!
- What?

321
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:03,048
Yeah, Bob!

322
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:09,184
The police. What an untidy group
ot little tascists.

323
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:11,518
What do you expect
in a town ot God?

324
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:15,526
Mormons run the state, and that
is the state of things, I'm atraid.

325
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,433
Listen, poser.

326
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:25,436
Let me just explain this to you.

327
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:27,734
It was my instinct to react that way
because you punched my triend.

328
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:31,367
I'm the bouncer for the band.
It's my job.

329
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:33,377
Yes, but this is a punk show.

330
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:35,606
And mayhem and punk shows...
It's like peas and carrots.

331
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:39,138
It's common for a guy to jump on stage,
and then he jumps right otf again.

332
00:23:39,217 --> 00:23:41,811
Look. I'm really sorry
about the beating...

333
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:43,821
and I hope the rest ot your stay
in America is more pleasant.

334
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:48,117
- You're under arrest, son.
- For selling pot?

335
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:50,423
- It's harmless, you know.
- No, the pot's tine.

336
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:53,589
However, this shirt happens to be
illegal in several states.

337
00:23:53,665 --> 00:23:57,260
I see.
It should be a torn shirt, huh?

338
00:23:57,335 --> 00:24:00,793
With a picture ot Ronald Reagan on it,
maybe with a bullet hole in his head?

339
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:06,004
- That would be more punk?
- Yeah. You're a good man, Mark.

340
00:24:06,077 --> 00:24:08,443
We need more men like you
in America.

341
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:10,447
I rest easier
now that you say this.

342
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:12,782
- Eddie.
- Bobby.

343
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:14,978
- Hey. Fuck you, man.
- Hey.

344
00:24:15,053 --> 00:24:16,987
- Hey, you're that singer dude.
- Hey.

345
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:21,219
- So, what did you think? Good show?
- I'll never play this town again, mate.

346
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,727
It's too tame for you British types?

347
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:26,491
- No, it's too bleedin' violent.
- Thank you.

348
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:29,125
Come with me.
I've got something to show you.

349
00:24:34,272 --> 00:24:36,433
So here's this band.

350
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:40,069
E.C.P., Extreme Corporal Punishment.

351
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:43,171
One ot the toughest,
most hard-core bands in the U.K.

352
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:47,207
Good band as well. They come to Salt
Lake City. They think it's too tough.

353
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:51,654
An 18-year-old punk beat the shit out ot
their bouncer. I rest my case on this.

354
00:24:51,723 --> 00:24:54,658
In a country of lost souls...

355
00:24:54,726 --> 00:24:56,660
rebellion comes hard...

356
00:24:56,728 --> 00:24:59,629
but in a religiously oppressive city...

357
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:03,634
which half its population
isn't even ot that religion...

358
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:06,364
it comes like fire.

359
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:17,208
You're here to visit?

360
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:20,843
Yes. I think we're all excited
to see how he's doing.

361
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:23,410
Have you seen The Exorcist?

362
00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:25,718
- Yeah.
- Did you like it?

363
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:29,316
Yeah. Is this dangerous?

364
00:25:29,394 --> 00:25:31,328
Not clinically.

365
00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:35,563
What does that mean?

366
00:25:40,338 --> 00:25:42,499
- Jesus!
- Hey, Bob.

367
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:44,439
Are you alive?

368
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:47,672
I want a cigarette, man.

369
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:49,179
I want to get out of here.

370
00:25:49,247 --> 00:25:50,942
Listen, buddy.
We've got good news.

371
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:53,280
They say today's gonna be
your last day.

372
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:55,080
- Today?
- Today.

373
00:25:55,153 --> 00:25:59,522
Thank God!
These doctors can kiss my ass!

374
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:01,855
Knock it oft, tough guy,
or I'll give you another shot.

375
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:04,259
That woman fucking hates me, man.

376
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:05,853
What's with the tape?

377
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:08,900
Don't tell me you're going poser on me,
you big loser.

378
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:13,404
No, dude. I'm going crazy, man.
How long have I been in here?

379
00:26:13,471 --> 00:26:16,031
- Three weeks.
- Oh, my God!

380
00:26:16,107 --> 00:26:19,133
- Anyone come visit you?
- No, no. Just you. Just you guys.

381
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:23,078
You did. I've been quarantined, man.
They named a disease atter me.

382
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:26,083
- You are a disease.
- Uh, what about your tather, Bob?

383
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:30,053
- What about my father?
- I just thought... He didn't...

384
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:34,990
Oh, no. He didn't come.
He's drunk, you know.

385
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,119
But I'm tree, huh? I'm tree.

386
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:42,296
You know, I loved the guy.

387
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:44,927
Now the fall of hate
could really get started.

388
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:47,836
The first order of business,
we threw a party at our apartment.

389
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:50,898
This is, like, the tirst party
of the tall, right?

390
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:53,444
The whole tribe's here.
Everyone's in the house.

391
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:54,944
Let me make introductions.

392
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:57,106
You remember Bob, ot course. He's...

393
00:26:57,182 --> 00:26:59,116
Hey, stop tuckin' with that stereo!

394
00:26:59,184 --> 00:27:02,119
He's also one ot the hosts.
It's his fucking stereo.

395
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:05,452
And this... Oh, my God.
This is Trish.

396
00:27:05,523 --> 00:27:07,718
She's, like, a Bohemian queen.

397
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:11,353
She is the goddess ot the scene.
Everybody really wants her.

398
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:13,192
Hey, come on.
Let's keep going.

399
00:27:13,264 --> 00:27:16,893
Now stay close
'cause I don't know everyone here.

400
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:18,959
There's a lot of posers.

401
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:22,734
Oh, this kid, though.
This kid, he's not a tuckin' poser.

402
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:25,970
He's not a poser.
He looks like a total nerd, right?

403
00:27:26,044 --> 00:27:28,535
This guy looks like a geek,
but his name's Mike.

404
00:27:28,613 --> 00:27:30,945
He's one of the most hard-core guys
in the scene.

405
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:33,416
Well, watch what happens.
Stay where you are. I'll be right back.

406
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,510
This is great.
It's my favorite part.

407
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:45,260
You see what I mean?
Punk rock!

408
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,696
It's punk rock!

409
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:50,564
The party's in tull swing.
Let's continue.

410
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:56,031
Hey, Mark, how's it rollin'?

411
00:27:56,107 --> 00:27:58,041
Rolling fine.

412
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:02,045
- Here. It's on me.
- For me?

413
00:28:02,113 --> 00:28:05,241
But be careful.
That stutf can make you stupid.

414
00:28:05,316 --> 00:28:07,341
Fuck you!

415
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:10,081
More stupid than you already are.

416
00:28:10,155 --> 00:28:14,592
Hey, this is Mark.
Now, Mark is not a punk rocker.

417
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:17,150
Why, he's nothing, really.
He's not even a peer.

418
00:28:17,228 --> 00:28:19,162
But everybody knew him,
and all the tribes love him...

419
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:21,562
because he always had pot and acid.

420
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:25,660
What this crazy toreign tuck was doing
behind this Iron Curtain, I had no idea.

421
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:27,762
I don't think anyone in Utah
really knew...

422
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:32,105
but we did know that he was rich,
loaded with killer bud...

423
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:35,169
and completely out
of his fuckin' mind.

424
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:39,342
Now, Mark was rich, but not because
he was a pusher, which he really wasn't.

425
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:41,078
He was independently wealthy.

426
00:28:41,152 --> 00:28:44,952
His whole family died in a plane crash
over in Europe when he was five.

427
00:28:45,023 --> 00:28:48,390
The thing was,
he liked to buy stuff and show it off.

428
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:51,827
His bank account bulged
from the insurance off the crash.

429
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:54,490
So you'd have to sit through
some bullshit if you wanted to score...

430
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,966
because the one thing about Mark,
he loved company.

431
00:28:57,035 --> 00:29:01,665
This looks like a silver record,
but it's not a silver record.

432
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,799
It's a laser disc.

433
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:05,843
This one is a water bed.

434
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:09,744
But it's not a normal water bed,
because a normal one goes like this.

435
00:29:09,814 --> 00:29:14,342
Lots of waves. Funny thing is,
this one doesn't have any waves.

436
00:29:15,553 --> 00:29:19,956
Well, why didn't you just buy
a normal mattress...

437
00:29:20,024 --> 00:29:21,958
that doesn't have waves?

438
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:25,588
This one doesn't have waves.

439
00:29:25,663 --> 00:29:29,656
See, it also comes in silver, but
I bought black because it looks cooler.

440
00:29:29,734 --> 00:29:31,793
- Yeah, but...
- This is the masterpiece.

441
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:34,703
It has one, two, three,
tour, tive, six, seven...

442
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:37,333
Seven settings
tor optimum comtort...

443
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:40,138
all ot which
I will gladly show you now.

444
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:42,111
It has this projector in the back.

445
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:45,149
Five thousand bucks. I mean,
you can buy a fucking car for that.

446
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:47,616
This thing here
has a little platinum thing.

447
00:29:47,685 --> 00:29:49,152
There's a movie on there.

448
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:52,781
And so it never,
never ever gets dirty.

449
00:29:52,857 --> 00:29:56,122
I never buy records. I only buy CDs
'cause they sound much better.

450
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:59,027
- That's great.
- Hey, there's more.

451
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:00,758
- A lot more?
- Much more!

452
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:02,695
Wake up.

453
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:05,702
It was a character flaw, sure,
but we all have those.

454
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:08,330
This part didn't concern me.
The main problem with Mark...

455
00:30:08,406 --> 00:30:11,603
was that he was intimidating,
and he had a tendency to snap.

456
00:30:11,676 --> 00:30:13,610
He was always afraid
of getting ripped off...

457
00:30:13,678 --> 00:30:16,306
yet at the same time, he ripped things
off without shame or guilt.

458
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:18,212
Chaos in man, although hopeful...

459
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:21,912
could also be, you know,
a little tiresome.

460
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:25,012
I had two bags ot grass
in this kitchen.

461
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:27,489
They are always trying to stitt me,
you know?

462
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:29,618
- Who is?
- Who?

463
00:30:29,694 --> 00:30:33,323
Who? Everybody.

464
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:35,992
You know I give to everybody, Stevo.
You know that.

465
00:30:36,067 --> 00:30:39,525
And they just go ahead
and try to take whatever they want.

466
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:43,106
It makes me want to kill...

467
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:47,572
which I've done in the past,
believe me.

468
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:49,613
I'm not saying
it makes me a man or anything.

469
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:52,946
I'm just passing on the intormation.

470
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:55,110
When did you kill?

471
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:57,416
In Miami I shot two men.

472
00:30:57,488 --> 00:31:00,116
Why do you think I'm here?
'Cause I love this place?

473
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:02,125
Salt Lake Shitty?

474
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:07,421
They tried to rob me,
so I shot them in the head.

475
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,102
You have to put at least one bullet
in the head just to make sure.

476
00:31:15,673 --> 00:31:17,937
Get out ot here.
Come on.

477
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:20,807
You didn't kill anybody.
Fuck you.

478
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,938
You don't believe me, huh?

479
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:26,482
Well...

480
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,879
- Hey.
- With this.

481
00:31:30,955 --> 00:31:32,923
You want to be a cowboy,
I show you cowboy.

482
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:35,323
Come on. Just put that thing away.
I hate those things.

483
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:38,829
Put it away.
I get the joke. Now put it away.

484
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:41,832
When I was a kid,
my family died in a crash.

485
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:47,296
- I know.
- You know?

486
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:53,237
My mother told us to buckle up because
things were going to get bumpy...

487
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:54,835
so I did.

488
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,847
I looked at her, and she smiled.

489
00:31:56,915 --> 00:32:00,612
And then like this, boom,
the plane was going down.

490
00:32:00,685 --> 00:32:04,815
My dad was next to the pilot,
and he told us not to worry.

491
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:09,223
But, hey, even at five I knew we had
trouble because the pilot was crying.

492
00:32:10,395 --> 00:32:14,354
So I looked at my sister. She was like,
"Oh, man. We're getting close."

493
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:18,630
So I looked at my mom again,
and she smiled at me again...

494
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:20,898
and so this time I smiled.

495
00:32:20,972 --> 00:32:23,133
And then we hit the ground...

496
00:32:23,207 --> 00:32:25,937
and something
came through that plane...

497
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:28,410
and cut my mother's head oft.

498
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:33,576
So now this head
was tlying straight at me...

499
00:32:33,651 --> 00:32:36,484
and she never took her eyes
otf ot me.

500
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:38,852
That's when I passed out.

501
00:32:38,923 --> 00:32:43,826
And when I woke up,
my tamily was all around me in pieces.

502
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:46,830
I saw my mother's arm,
my sister's leg...

503
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:49,458
my brother's head...

504
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:51,593
but I couldn't tind my tather.

505
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:53,603
I wanted to, though...

506
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:56,606
'cause I was going to kick
his fuckin' dead body.

507
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:00,410
'Cause he lied.

508
00:33:01,546 --> 00:33:04,777
You know what
I'm trying to tell you, Stevo?

509
00:33:04,849 --> 00:33:09,252
It's so easy,
so easy to get it taken away from you.

510
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,812
And they try...
every chance they get, they try.

511
00:33:18,896 --> 00:33:20,830
It's bad.

512
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,267
I mean, it's really bad.

513
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:29,039
Do you trust Bob?

514
00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:34,002
Bob? Yeah.

515
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:42,412
I think he might
have taken my stutt.

516
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:47,888
Well, he's asleep.

517
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:50,052
What about when we were upstairs?

518
00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:52,062
He could have taken it then.

519
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:55,798
Right. Well, I don't think so.

520
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:58,062
I mean, it's not like Bob.
He's not a thiet.

521
00:33:58,136 --> 00:34:01,333
How do you know? You know what?
I think we should ask him.

522
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:03,340
No. Hey, Mark. Wait.

523
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:05,740
Hey, Mark. Come on.
Just chill out, man.

524
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:08,005
- Oh, Jesus. Hey, wake up.
- Hey, you!

525
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:10,411
Get up. You have my shit!

526
00:34:10,481 --> 00:34:13,177
Put that shit away
before I kick your ass, man.

527
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:16,347
Are you all right?

528
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:18,787
Get oft my back!
I don't want to hurt you!

529
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:20,915
Come here!

530
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:22,926
- What? What?
- Come on. Empty your pockets.

531
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:26,828
- This is fucking uncool, Mark!
- We'll see about cool in a minute.

532
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:29,924
All right. See,
he doesn't have anything. I told you.

533
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:33,437
- Shut up! Man!
- That's it, dude.

534
00:34:43,681 --> 00:34:45,114
I'm sorry.

535
00:34:47,218 --> 00:34:50,710
- You're sorry?
- Yeah, I just thought you had my shit.

536
00:34:50,788 --> 00:34:52,221
Well, tuck you, man!

537
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:54,781
Hey, don't say that, tuck you.
I said I'm sorry.

538
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:57,123
- No, fuck you!
- I said sorry!

539
00:34:57,195 --> 00:34:59,823
- Come on, Bob. You're like my brother.
- No. Get away.

540
00:34:59,897 --> 00:35:02,832
- All right. I'm not mad. Yeah.
- You're my triend, huh?

541
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,596
- Give me a kiss.
- All right.

542
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:07,604
Here you go.

543
00:35:07,672 --> 00:35:10,004
Hey, did I scare you?

544
00:35:10,074 --> 00:35:12,008
It didn't scare me.

545
00:35:12,076 --> 00:35:14,408
It was a joke, you know.

546
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:16,572
- That's tunny.
- Yeah. Okay.

547
00:35:16,647 --> 00:35:19,207
- Good one, buddy.
- Okay.

548
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:22,150
- You shot the couch.
- You know what? I buy a new one.

549
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:27,556
- Oh, there you go.
- I say we go out and steal a car, huh?

550
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,718
- All right.
- Okay? Let's go.

551
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:32,262
Punk rock. Maybe you should
just leave the gun, though.

552
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:36,664
So Mark and Bob made up
'cause that's just how Mark was.

553
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:39,396
What could you do?
Later he stole a car.

554
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:43,463
Not that he needed a car.
He already had, like, three cars.

555
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:45,475
But I guess fun is fun.

556
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:48,171
We drove around for a while,
got stoned... me and Mark.

557
00:35:48,246 --> 00:35:50,009
Bob just drank beers.

558
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:54,381
We talked and listened to Mark's
nonsense theories about everything.

559
00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:58,218
You know what the funny thing is
about Ronald Reagan?

560
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:02,817
Actually, it's not that funny because
the poor guy has only one testicle left.

561
00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:05,522
- No shit.
- It's true. I saw a picture once.

562
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:09,961
- Fuck, dude!
- That explains a lot.

563
00:36:10,034 --> 00:36:11,467
Ronnie.

564
00:36:13,037 --> 00:36:17,406
The world has no way to clean itselt.
That's why there is so much dust.

565
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:22,708
There is this underground road,
and it leads from Texas to D.C.

566
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:27,183
You know what?
They smuggle UFOs through there.

567
00:36:27,251 --> 00:36:29,185
It's a bad thing.

568
00:36:29,253 --> 00:36:31,721
Unidentitied tlying objects?

569
00:36:31,789 --> 00:36:35,452
Did you know
that dolphins are man-evolved?

570
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:37,494
Did you know that?

571
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:40,360
I saw once a halt-dolphin,
halt-man in Greece.

572
00:36:40,431 --> 00:36:44,333
And as the night closed,
Mark decided to dump the stolen car.

573
00:36:44,402 --> 00:36:46,427
You know, evidence.

574
00:36:49,507 --> 00:36:50,940
Sink.

575
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:58,576
Sink, you fool!

576
00:36:58,649 --> 00:37:00,446
Hey, why won't she sink?

577
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:03,885
Well, it's 'cause
it's the Great Salt Lake.

578
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:07,083
- And?
- Yeah, dude. There's salt in it.

579
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:09,251
It's, like,
the saltiest lake in the world.

580
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:13,263
- It makes things buoyant, you know?
- Buoyant. It floats.

581
00:37:13,331 --> 00:37:15,265
You've gotta be kidding me.

582
00:37:17,868 --> 00:37:19,301
Sink, you fool!

583
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:23,431
You tuckin' stupid
bastard lake! Sink!

584
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:28,611
- What are you trying to do to me?
- All right. Okay. No, no, no.

585
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:31,773
- That's okay. Let's go home.
- Guys!

586
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:34,147
I'm not done with you!

587
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:40,424
But when all was said and done,
Mark was an okay guy...

588
00:37:40,491 --> 00:37:43,585
and an evening with him
was proof of anarchy.

589
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:48,625
So we accepted him,
and he came to our parties.

590
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:51,759
Hey, I'll catch you later,
all right?

591
00:37:51,836 --> 00:37:53,827
Not it I see you tirst.

592
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:56,771
- I know what you're talking about.
- Excuse me. Can I get through?

593
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:59,901
- Hey, Jen!
- Oh, I love your house.

594
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:02,275
Thank you.
Hey, lookit, Jenniter. Lookit.

595
00:38:02,346 --> 00:38:05,179
This is Jenniter.
She's 17. She looks a lot older.

596
00:38:05,249 --> 00:38:07,877
She looks older 'cause this litestyle
really hardens you.

597
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:10,386
It takes the piss out ot you.
And she's got this brother...

598
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:13,651
Easy over there!
She's got this brother named Chris.

599
00:38:13,724 --> 00:38:16,557
He's this death rock punk guy,
and he's, like...

600
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:20,028
I don't know why I'm telling you
about him 'cause you'll meet him later.

601
00:38:20,097 --> 00:38:23,726
Now this girl...
absolutely beautiful, sweet as pie...

602
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:26,793
is the greatest child
God ever put on this earth...

603
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:30,136
but you do not wanna mess with her
when she hasn't had her medication...

604
00:38:30,207 --> 00:38:31,799
in a dark, deserted alley.

605
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:34,538
She will, I repeat,
she will rip your head off.

606
00:38:34,612 --> 00:38:36,671
This girl is a carnivore.

607
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:40,444
Look. Carnivore.
Be caretul.

608
00:38:40,518 --> 00:38:42,986
Who else can I introduce you to?

609
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:45,579
- Unbelievable!
- Oh, yeah, baby.

610
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:51,592
This is Sandy. Oh, my God, Sandy.
I like Sandy.

611
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:55,098
Now, Sandy has nothing to do
with anarchy in general.

612
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:58,363
She's just a beautitul,
wonderful, tunny, witty...

613
00:38:58,436 --> 00:39:02,167
Ioving, sexy, tough-as-nails,
a little weird girl...

614
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:04,264
and I absolutely adore her.

615
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,173
I like Sandy a lot.

616
00:39:06,243 --> 00:39:09,178
This is John the mod.
Now, mods aren't punks.

617
00:39:09,246 --> 00:39:12,010
We get in a lot of spats with mods,
actually, but he's okay.

618
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:16,281
He's one ot those kind ot guys
goes in between the tribes freely.

619
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,481
Like a diplomat.

620
00:39:18,556 --> 00:39:22,617
- Gandhi!
- He always brings gitts.

621
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:26,151
- Where'd you get the beer?
- Wyoming. Where else?

622
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:29,722
This actually needs some explanation.
Beers in supermarkets in Utah is weak.

623
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,428
Three points instead of
the normal six points ot alcohol.

624
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:35,097
It's the religious intluence,
and it's a pain in the ass.

625
00:39:35,172 --> 00:39:37,902
To me, it makes no sense. It you've got
alcohol, you've got alcohol.

626
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:39,909
So why three instead ot six?

627
00:39:39,977 --> 00:39:43,037
You know a drunk's just gonna drink
twice as many beers to get drunk.

628
00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:45,048
So not only do you have a drunk
on your hands...

629
00:39:45,116 --> 00:39:47,584
but you got a drunk
who's fat and gross.

630
00:39:47,651 --> 00:39:51,109
There's nothing worse. So if you want
real beer, you have two choices:

631
00:39:51,188 --> 00:39:52,621
A, the state-run liquor store.

632
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:55,124
You see,
you can buy regular beer here.

633
00:39:55,192 --> 00:39:57,456
There are all of three stores
in Salt Lake City to buy it.

634
00:39:57,528 --> 00:40:00,053
And their hours suck. Oppression.

635
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:04,625
Also, these were the only places to buy
any alcohol outside of private clubs.

636
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:07,637
Who can afford those,
except for guys like my dad?

637
00:40:07,705 --> 00:40:10,173
Don't. Quit it. Stop.
Knock it off. Come on. Don't do that.

638
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:13,438
So what do they call you?
Do you have a nickname?

639
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:16,207
- Ah, they do. Yeah.
- TLM?

640
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:19,545
- The long man?
- Third leg material?

641
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:22,085
You could get whiskey, gin, wine.

642
00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:24,747
Here's where they kept it.
And here's the worst part.

643
00:40:24,822 --> 00:40:26,084
IDs, boys.

644
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:30,990
See, this teller
is not just a teller.

645
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:33,359
He's a cop. This guy right there,
he's a fucking cop.

646
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:37,299
So we buy a beer, and this guy's
callin' a squad car to follow us home.

647
00:40:37,368 --> 00:40:41,134
'Cause one look at us, and he knows,
"Gosh, those guys are gonna be trouble."

648
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:44,674
Now, Bob and I may not be innocent...

649
00:40:44,742 --> 00:40:48,041
but we are usually
pretty law-abiding, usually.

650
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:51,309
On this occasion,
we had done absolutely nothing wrong.

651
00:40:51,382 --> 00:40:54,351
We looked suspicious, yes,
but in all the years of pre-law...

652
00:40:54,418 --> 00:40:56,648
I uncovered a lot of contradictions
in the system...

653
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,951
but I had found nothing
that told me looking suspicious...

654
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:01,457
was a crime in and of itself.

655
00:41:01,525 --> 00:41:03,993
Come on.
Just give me a shot.

656
00:41:04,061 --> 00:41:07,087
- Okay?
- There you go! Come on.

657
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:21,767
But this was not about the law.
This was about rednecks.

658
00:41:21,846 --> 00:41:23,780
So the battle continued.
Who's to blame 'em?

659
00:41:23,848 --> 00:41:26,214
The cops were rednecks,
our mortal enemies...

660
00:41:26,283 --> 00:41:28,774
worse than mods, rockers or posers.

661
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:30,912
So we took our beatings when we could.

662
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:34,515
But in this complex world of fascism
that was Utah state policy...

663
00:41:34,592 --> 00:41:37,527
we had only one choice
if we wanted real beer.

664
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:39,529
Choice B, Wyoming.

665
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:52,601
The state line
was one hour and one half...

666
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:54,610
a short ride to Evingston, Wyoming...

667
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:56,612
where you could get booze
like a free man...

668
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,672
like boozers used to go to Canada
for the poison during Prohibition.

669
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:02,344
So we rode that morning
before the party with Eddie.

670
00:42:02,419 --> 00:42:05,411
Eddie wasn't an anarchist.
He wasn't really even a punk.

671
00:42:05,489 --> 00:42:07,423
Eddie was into women.

672
00:42:08,325 --> 00:42:11,089
But not in a macho, jerky kind of way.
He was a true romantic.

673
00:42:11,161 --> 00:42:15,495
He had his ass beat several times
for being gay, which he was not.

674
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:18,000
Imagine.
Fag-bashed without the benefits.

675
00:42:18,068 --> 00:42:21,196
I couldn't give a shit what the rednecks
in this town think about me.

676
00:42:21,272 --> 00:42:25,868
I know I'm not gay. Ladies know I'm not.
I have no problem with gay guys.

677
00:42:25,943 --> 00:42:29,401
As a matter of tact, they are
some ot the coolest guys I know.

678
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,573
The only reason
half these guys start shit...

679
00:42:31,649 --> 00:42:33,879
it's not because they wanna tight me.

680
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:35,942
It's 'cause they wanna fuck me.

681
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:37,180
I don't know, man.

682
00:42:37,254 --> 00:42:40,587
It somebody called me somethin'
that I wasn't, I could see getting mad.

683
00:42:40,658 --> 00:42:43,821
The problem with somebody
giving you shit about being gay...

684
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:47,660
it's not that they're wrong about you,
it's that they're giving you shit.

685
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:50,598
- Get it?
- So do you like this music, man?

686
00:42:50,668 --> 00:42:52,659
Yeah. It rocks.

687
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:56,297
- I think it's tor posers.
- Well, I think you're a tag.

688
00:42:56,373 --> 00:42:59,433
- Fuck you.
- Fuck yourselt. You'll get more pussy.

689
00:43:01,979 --> 00:43:05,107
If looking the way we did in Utah
was unusual...

690
00:43:05,182 --> 00:43:08,117
in Wyoming, affectionately
called the Cowboy State...

691
00:43:08,185 --> 00:43:11,450
we were fucking aliens.

692
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:45,854
What the hell are you?

693
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:50,757
We come from the east
in search ot the Messiah.

694
00:43:50,828 --> 00:43:52,591
We tollowed that big star.

695
00:43:52,663 --> 00:43:55,325
Yeah, we bring gold
and trankincense.

696
00:43:55,399 --> 00:43:57,333
- Myrrh.
- Myrrh.

697
00:43:57,401 --> 00:44:00,461
- You do what?
- Followed the star.

698
00:44:01,372 --> 00:44:05,433
Oh, my God. Who let you boys
out ot the state institute?

699
00:44:05,509 --> 00:44:07,773
We'd better get you boys
back in the hospital.

700
00:44:07,845 --> 00:44:09,278
No. It's all right, man.

701
00:44:09,346 --> 00:44:13,180
We're from England.

702
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:15,218
- England?
- Yeah.

703
00:44:15,285 --> 00:44:19,949
That's right. That's probably why
we seem so weird to you, man.

704
00:44:20,024 --> 00:44:22,049
England, huh?

705
00:44:23,127 --> 00:44:25,459
Well, that explains it, I guess.

706
00:44:25,529 --> 00:44:31,126
You boys enjoying your stay here
in the good ol' U.S. of A.?

707
00:44:31,201 --> 00:44:33,135
Sure thing.
It's a great land.

708
00:44:33,203 --> 00:44:36,400
- What the hell is that?
- It's all right, Mother.

709
00:44:36,473 --> 00:44:38,532
They're from England.

710
00:44:38,609 --> 00:44:41,476
Oh, that figures, don't it?

711
00:44:41,545 --> 00:44:44,309
What the hell did they do
to your hair?

712
00:44:44,381 --> 00:44:47,009
My God,
you look like a gol-durned Indian!

713
00:44:47,084 --> 00:44:50,315
It was a medical experiment,
but he's gonna be okay.

714
00:44:50,387 --> 00:44:52,855
You poor boy.

715
00:44:52,923 --> 00:44:55,357
That's how come
there's so many floods and earthquakes.

716
00:44:55,426 --> 00:44:57,394
There is a curse on the land.

717
00:44:57,461 --> 00:44:59,486
- The end is at hand.
- That's so true.

718
00:44:59,563 --> 00:45:04,330
Excuse me, ma'am, but there have been
floods and earthquakes...

719
00:45:04,401 --> 00:45:06,426
since the beginning ot time, dude.

720
00:45:06,503 --> 00:45:10,530
That is so, but never have so many
of Satan's tollowers...

721
00:45:10,607 --> 00:45:12,939
been amassed on the Earth
as there are now.

722
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:14,978
And the Scripture states clearly...

723
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:17,536
that Satan's tollowers
will be in the majority...

724
00:45:17,614 --> 00:45:20,481
and then God
will raise His head...

725
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,781
and tire will spew
from His snout...

726
00:45:22,853 --> 00:45:25,515
and vengeance will burn
in His eyes.

727
00:45:25,589 --> 00:45:29,116
You have not seen such fury
like the wrath ot God.

728
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:32,856
So you guys have lots
of devil worshipers around these parts?

729
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:34,864
Oh, more than ever.
They bear the mark.

730
00:45:34,932 --> 00:45:37,560
- Amen.
- Well, what about World War II?

731
00:45:37,634 --> 00:45:41,695
The Nazis were as good as Satan's army,
and the world didn't end then.

732
00:45:41,772 --> 00:45:44,104
Yeah, dude.
What about the Nazis?

733
00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:47,405
I don't see Nazis
as devil worshipers.

734
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:48,877
Oh, you don't?

735
00:45:48,946 --> 00:45:52,040
I see 'em more like
a gathering ot people.

736
00:45:52,116 --> 00:45:54,607
What? What did...

737
00:45:54,685 --> 00:45:57,882
What's this about a mark?
You guys said something about a mark.

738
00:45:57,955 --> 00:45:59,616
666.

739
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:01,658
The mark will be on all ot them.

740
00:46:01,725 --> 00:46:05,559
- The mark. Father!
- Oh, my God!

741
00:46:05,629 --> 00:46:07,620
- I tear you, Father!
- Oh, my God!

742
00:46:07,698 --> 00:46:10,258
- My padre!
- Oh, my God!

743
00:46:14,571 --> 00:46:15,902
Oh, shit!

744
00:46:15,973 --> 00:46:18,407
- Go, go, go!
- Told you those boys were trouble.

745
00:46:18,475 --> 00:46:20,943
Oh, shit!

746
00:46:29,853 --> 00:46:32,754
The Wyoming folk...
Well, they were okay, I guess.

747
00:46:32,823 --> 00:46:34,814
Just confused like the rest of us.

748
00:46:34,892 --> 00:46:39,226
But Nazis always pissed us off.
There were a few Nazi punks in town.

749
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:43,892
I don't know what these guys wanted.
They had the shaved heads and arm bands.

750
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:46,231
Rebellion is one thing.
That I understood.

751
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:48,464
But there are some things
that are just sacred.

752
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:51,906
Not to mention that anarchy,
a systemless society that I wanted...

753
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:56,344
no government, no rules... that was
the complete opposite of Nazi fascism.

754
00:46:56,413 --> 00:46:59,405
So we kicked the shit out of these kids
every chance we could.

755
00:47:01,785 --> 00:47:03,719
And that was that.

756
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:07,950
Hi, my name's Eddie.

757
00:47:10,127 --> 00:47:12,527
You exist in a world ot dreams, Bob.

758
00:47:12,596 --> 00:47:16,225
You know, I was just sitting over there
in that chair in the corner.

759
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:18,598
I didn't really teel the particular urge
to talk to anybody...

760
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:20,261
and then I saw you
walk in the room.

761
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:22,362
You are like a treasure.

762
00:47:22,439 --> 00:47:24,373
I have found a treasure.

763
00:47:24,441 --> 00:47:28,844
Something came over me... this urge
to come over here and talk to you.

764
00:47:28,912 --> 00:47:31,574
I am Aladdin,
and this is my lamp.

765
00:47:31,648 --> 00:47:34,242
I wished for you,
and here you are.

766
00:47:35,652 --> 00:47:37,813
You're like a poet, dude.

767
00:47:37,888 --> 00:47:40,652
No, it's you who are the poet.

768
00:47:40,724 --> 00:47:43,921
Your face is like Ginsberg...

769
00:47:43,994 --> 00:47:46,360
or Wilde or even Hawthorne.

770
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:49,922
Great tucking party! Fuck, yeah!

771
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,867
What are you?

772
00:47:52,936 --> 00:47:56,303
I'm an ant
staring up at a human being.

773
00:47:56,373 --> 00:48:00,309
I wait with great intensity
to be squashed by you.

774
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,941
You want to...
Who the tuck threw that?

775
00:48:07,017 --> 00:48:08,951
Great tuckin' party!

776
00:48:28,672 --> 00:48:33,200
The fight. What does it mean,
and where does it come from? An essay.

777
00:48:33,277 --> 00:48:35,404
Homo sapiens. A man.

778
00:48:35,479 --> 00:48:37,572
He is alone in the universe.

779
00:48:37,648 --> 00:48:40,139
A punker. Still a man.

780
00:48:40,217 --> 00:48:42,151
He is alone in the universe.

781
00:48:42,219 --> 00:48:44,084
But he connects. How?

782
00:48:44,154 --> 00:48:46,281
They hit each other. Ooh!

783
00:48:46,356 --> 00:48:49,917
No clearer way to evaluate
whether or not you're alive.

784
00:48:49,993 --> 00:48:52,860
Now, complications.

785
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:56,491
A reason to fight:
somebody different.

786
00:48:56,566 --> 00:48:57,999
Difference creates dispute.

787
00:48:58,068 --> 00:49:00,832
Dispute is a reason to fight.

788
00:49:00,904 --> 00:49:04,931
Now, to fight is a reason to feel pain.
Life is pain.

789
00:49:05,008 --> 00:49:07,442
So to fight, with reason...

790
00:49:07,511 --> 00:49:09,809
is to be alive with reason.

791
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:13,782
Final analysis.
To fight: a reason to live.

792
00:49:13,850 --> 00:49:16,580
Problems and contradictions:
I am an anarchist.

793
00:49:16,653 --> 00:49:19,417
I believe that there should be
no rules, only chaos.

794
00:49:19,489 --> 00:49:23,255
Fighting appears to be chaos, and when
we slam in a pit at a show, it is.

795
00:49:23,327 --> 00:49:26,888
But when we fight for a reason,
like rednecks, there is a system.

796
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:29,990
We fight for what we stand for... chaos.
But fighting is a structure.

797
00:49:30,067 --> 00:49:33,195
Fighting is to establish power,
power is government...

798
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:35,204
and government is not anarchy.

799
00:49:35,272 --> 00:49:37,570
Government is war,
and war is fighting.

800
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:39,905
The circle goes like this:
Our redneck skirmishes...

801
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:42,502
are cheaper versions
of conventional warfare.

802
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:44,513
War implies extreme government...

803
00:49:44,581 --> 00:49:48,449
because wars are fought to
enforce rules or ideals, even freedom.

804
00:49:48,518 --> 00:49:50,486
But other people's ideals
forced on someone else...

805
00:49:50,554 --> 00:49:53,489
even if it is something like freedom,
is still a rule.

806
00:49:53,557 --> 00:49:55,548
Not anarchy.

807
00:49:55,625 --> 00:49:58,822
This contradiction was becoming
clear to me in the fall of '85.

808
00:49:58,895 --> 00:50:01,489
Even as early as my first party,
why did I love to fight?

809
00:50:01,565 --> 00:50:04,227
I framed it,
but I still don't understand it.

810
00:50:04,301 --> 00:50:08,397
It goes against my beliefs
as a true anarchist, but there it was.

811
00:50:08,472 --> 00:50:10,633
Competition, fighting, capitalism...

812
00:50:10,707 --> 00:50:12,800
government, the system.

813
00:50:12,876 --> 00:50:14,503
It's what we always did.

814
00:50:14,578 --> 00:50:17,342
Rednecks kicked the shit out of punks,
punks kicked the shit out of mods...

815
00:50:17,414 --> 00:50:20,406
mods kicked the shit out of skinheads,
skinheads took out the metal guys...

816
00:50:20,484 --> 00:50:22,952
the metal guys beat the living shit
out of new wavers...

817
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:25,989
and the new wavers did nothing...
they were the new hippies.

818
00:50:26,056 --> 00:50:28,047
What was the point?
Final summation?

819
00:50:29,126 --> 00:50:30,559
None.

820
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:44,772
So I'll just close up
it you guys give me a second.

821
00:50:47,444 --> 00:50:51,540
Dude, she's, like, responsible,
you know?

822
00:50:51,615 --> 00:50:53,742
She's a businesswoman.
She owns her own store.

823
00:50:53,817 --> 00:50:56,308
She's making a contribution
to society.

824
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:59,844
Bob, she owns a head shop.
She sells bongs, Bob.

825
00:50:59,923 --> 00:51:03,689
- No, no, no. It's not what you sell.
- Blah, blah, blah.

826
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:06,729
Why do you got to be so cynical?
Why don't you grow up?

827
00:51:09,032 --> 00:51:10,465
You bitch!

828
00:51:10,534 --> 00:51:13,469
- Hey, Mark.
- Hey. Great party last week.

829
00:51:13,537 --> 00:51:16,199
- We aim to please.
- Animals.

830
00:51:16,273 --> 00:51:17,797
I've always loved animals.

831
00:51:17,874 --> 00:51:19,967
It was a little violent
at the end.

832
00:51:20,043 --> 00:51:23,479
Violent.
Look who's talking, Mr. NRA.

833
00:51:23,547 --> 00:51:27,415
- What are you doing here?
- Actually, I came by to say I'm otf.

834
00:51:27,484 --> 00:51:30,282
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to Miami.

835
00:51:30,353 --> 00:51:33,083
- What the hell is in Miami?
- Hell is in Miami.

836
00:51:33,156 --> 00:51:37,092
Don't worry. I'll be back.
You can always count on that.

837
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:39,958
Why would you ever come back
to a place like this, man?

838
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:43,898
It's like any other place, Bob...
people, houses, roads, cars.

839
00:51:43,967 --> 00:51:45,901
What else do you think
is out there?

840
00:51:45,969 --> 00:51:48,631
- Freedom.
- Yeah.

841
00:51:48,705 --> 00:51:51,003
Freedom.

842
00:51:51,074 --> 00:51:52,598
It's not out there.

843
00:51:52,676 --> 00:51:56,407
Freedom is another way
ot saying "death."

844
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,004
Know what I mean?

845
00:51:58,081 --> 00:52:02,609
You're pretty fuckin' weird, man.
You know that?

846
00:52:02,686 --> 00:52:05,814
- I'm ott.
- All right, man. See ya.

847
00:52:05,889 --> 00:52:07,982
Hey, Mark,
if you ever get lonely...

848
00:52:08,058 --> 00:52:10,959
or if you ever need someone
to talk to...

849
00:52:11,027 --> 00:52:13,188
Bob's there tor you.

850
00:52:15,432 --> 00:52:18,595
- Fuck you!
- And that was the last we saw of Mark.

851
00:52:18,668 --> 00:52:21,193
Never came back from Florida,
if that was where he was going.

852
00:52:21,271 --> 00:52:22,704
Rumor flew around...

853
00:52:22,772 --> 00:52:26,367
that he had died in a plane crash like
he was supposed to all those years ago.

854
00:52:26,443 --> 00:52:29,378
Anyways, that was Salt Lake.
People came in, and they went out.

855
00:52:29,446 --> 00:52:30,538
Oh, no.

856
00:52:30,614 --> 00:52:34,277
Fuck you.

857
00:52:34,351 --> 00:52:37,582
So, Trish, are we hangin' out later?

858
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:40,282
I'll tell you what, Bob.
You're coming with me.

859
00:52:40,357 --> 00:52:43,224
- I am?
- That's right.

860
00:52:43,293 --> 00:52:45,727
- I own you now.
- Oh, yeah. That's right.

861
00:52:45,795 --> 00:52:49,697
I torgot to tell you.
I sold myselt to Trish tor 36 bucks.

862
00:52:49,766 --> 00:52:52,963
Thirty-six bucks.
Wow, Trish, that's a good deal.

863
00:52:53,036 --> 00:52:55,800
Salt Lake City.

864
00:52:55,872 --> 00:52:58,500
Land of the dead sea.

865
00:52:58,575 --> 00:53:01,339
Zion, as the Mormons call it.

866
00:53:01,411 --> 00:53:03,709
It really is the holy land.

867
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:08,484
See you, Stevo.

868
00:53:17,661 --> 00:53:19,595
You can't atford me, old man.

869
00:53:22,666 --> 00:53:25,658
- How are things going these days?
- Not so bad.

870
00:53:25,735 --> 00:53:29,933
- How are the ladies treatin' ya?
- The ladies?

871
00:53:30,006 --> 00:53:34,102
I tell you, the women in this town
are so miserable...

872
00:53:34,177 --> 00:53:36,111
I'd give anything
to get the hell out.

873
00:53:36,179 --> 00:53:39,615
You know, you gave up a good thing
in my mother, sir.

874
00:53:39,683 --> 00:53:41,207
Maybe so.

875
00:53:41,284 --> 00:53:43,218
So, good news.

876
00:53:45,021 --> 00:53:47,251
The world is coming to its end.

877
00:53:47,324 --> 00:53:49,986
- Better.
- Oh. Ow, shit!

878
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:52,358
Better than that?
The people are revolting.

879
00:53:52,429 --> 00:53:53,862
- You...
- Yeah?

880
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:55,864
- have been invited...
- Uh-huh?

881
00:53:55,932 --> 00:53:58,093
to attend Harvard Law School.

882
00:53:58,168 --> 00:53:59,430
Yeah.

883
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:05,764
Dad, you and I really gotta work
on your detinition ot good news.

884
00:54:05,842 --> 00:54:10,040
Steven, this is great news.
You've already gone through pre-law.

885
00:54:10,113 --> 00:54:14,174
Why not tinish the process,
and in the best possible way?

886
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:16,310
That's so funny,
because, gosh, Father...

887
00:54:16,386 --> 00:54:18,946
don't even remember applying
to Harvard Law.

888
00:54:19,022 --> 00:54:22,219
- I applied tor you.
- You mean you signed my name?

889
00:54:22,292 --> 00:54:25,853
- Yeah.
- Hey, congratulations, old man!

890
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:29,023
Hope you enjoy your second tour
ot Harvard Law School.

891
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:33,736
Steven, are you going
to walk around like this torever?

892
00:54:33,803 --> 00:54:37,204
You went to school. You got
great grades. What else is there?

893
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:39,742
I cheated, Dad.
I cheated all through college.

894
00:54:39,809 --> 00:54:43,336
Oh, that's right.
Yeah, you cheated. But why?

895
00:54:43,413 --> 00:54:45,847
You obviously cared enough
about your grades to do well.

896
00:54:45,915 --> 00:54:49,009
I know you, Steve.
You're just like me.

897
00:54:49,085 --> 00:54:51,280
I'm like you, maybe,
but not completely.

898
00:54:51,354 --> 00:54:55,381
Then why pre-law?
Why not liberal science?

899
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:57,619
Why go at all?

900
00:54:57,694 --> 00:54:59,662
I studied law
'cause I wanted to learn...

901
00:54:59,729 --> 00:55:02,596
how completely full ot shit
your lite's ambition was.

902
00:55:02,666 --> 00:55:05,032
That's crazy.
You know that.

903
00:55:05,101 --> 00:55:08,867
You know what I think it is?
I think you've become a fascist.

904
00:55:08,938 --> 00:55:11,429
- A fascist?
- You're a Nazi.

905
00:55:11,508 --> 00:55:13,635
I'm Jewish.
How can I be a Nazi?

906
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:17,407
That's the worst. Dad, look at this.
What kind of car is this?

907
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:18,913
This would be a Porsche.

908
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:21,177
A Porsche that you bought
at a Volkswagen dealership.

909
00:55:21,251 --> 00:55:23,981
Volkswagen.

910
00:55:24,054 --> 00:55:26,147
Right? For the people.
Who designed it?

911
00:55:26,222 --> 00:55:29,350
Who made that possible?
Let me give you a hint. Adolf Hitler.

912
00:55:29,426 --> 00:55:31,519
- It's just a car, okay?
- Absolutely.

913
00:55:31,594 --> 00:55:33,687
I completely understand that point.

914
00:55:33,763 --> 00:55:36,391
But it's a car that was built,
designed and created...

915
00:55:36,466 --> 00:55:39,230
out ot the blood and pain
ot your people.

916
00:55:39,302 --> 00:55:41,896
- Let me take you to lunch.
- Okay.

917
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,203
Hang on.

918
00:55:46,609 --> 00:55:49,908
My dad wasn't all bad.
He just, you know, had no clue.

919
00:55:49,979 --> 00:55:51,674
I liked to bust his balls.

920
00:55:51,748 --> 00:55:55,582
What pissed me off, though, was,
he was right about one thing.

921
00:55:55,652 --> 00:55:58,212
Why did I do so well in school?
I didn't want to.

922
00:55:58,288 --> 00:56:00,222
I mean, I tried not to give a shit.

923
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:04,590
I knew they were just trying to mold me
into cannon fodder for their wars.

924
00:56:04,661 --> 00:56:07,562
And I knew
that meaning lie elsewhere.

925
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:10,827
But somehow I studied,
and somehow I got the grades...

926
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:14,961
and now, somehow, I was accepted
to a fucking Ivy League school.

927
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:17,438
Last place on the planet
for a guy like me.

928
00:56:17,507 --> 00:56:20,908
I mean, I wouldn't go there
unless it was to set it on fire.

929
00:56:20,977 --> 00:56:24,936
Hey, what are you staring at?
Did you get a good picture?

930
00:56:25,014 --> 00:56:28,211
Now, there was this issue
of a lifelong struggle with poverty...

931
00:56:28,284 --> 00:56:30,844
which was beginning to cause
reflection to myself...

932
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:33,718
after I had run into someone
from my past a few days earlier.

933
00:56:33,790 --> 00:56:37,419
You guys wouldn't happen to have
a dollar or a little somethin'?

934
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:40,726
Oh, shit. Sean!

935
00:56:40,797 --> 00:56:44,289
- Yeah?
- Hey, it's me. Stevo.

936
00:56:45,201 --> 00:56:48,398
- Bob!
- No, Stevo!

937
00:56:48,471 --> 00:56:50,268
Stevo!
How you doing, man?

938
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:53,138
There you go.
You have no idea who I am, do you?

939
00:56:53,209 --> 00:56:55,040
Remember?
High school. Mohawk.

940
00:56:55,111 --> 00:56:56,976
Yeah, you had the tuckin' mohawk.

941
00:56:57,046 --> 00:56:59,173
- Yeah. Punk!
- How are you doing?

942
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:01,581
Good. How are you doing?

943
00:57:01,651 --> 00:57:05,314
- I heard they put you away.
- But they let me out. I'm a tree man.

944
00:57:05,388 --> 00:57:08,551
Oh, hey, this is Sandy.

945
00:57:08,625 --> 00:57:10,559
Sandy, this is Sean.
Sean, this is Sandy.

946
00:57:10,627 --> 00:57:12,788
- Hi.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

947
00:57:12,862 --> 00:57:15,626
- Likewise.
- So, what you been doing with yourselt?

948
00:57:15,698 --> 00:57:17,461
Oh, man,
I'm a fucking beggar now.

949
00:57:17,534 --> 00:57:19,934
It fucking sucks.

950
00:57:20,003 --> 00:57:23,336
- Wow. You should get a job.
- I tried that.

951
00:57:23,406 --> 00:57:25,840
I fuckin' tried that. Okay?

952
00:57:34,717 --> 00:57:36,651
I gotta go.

953
00:57:38,021 --> 00:57:41,855
- Can I help you?
- Yeah. I called about the job.

954
00:57:41,925 --> 00:57:44,860
- You called?
- Yeah. I wanna sell clothes.

955
00:57:44,928 --> 00:57:46,589
Women's clothes.

956
00:57:46,663 --> 00:57:50,030
I don't know.
Have you had experience?

957
00:57:50,099 --> 00:57:52,533
- With what?
- Women's clothes.

958
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:56,769
What the fuck would I be doing
in women's clothes?

959
00:57:56,840 --> 00:58:00,674
What do I look like, a transvestite?
I'm not no tuckin' transvestite!

960
00:58:00,743 --> 00:58:04,474
No, no, no.
I mean, have you ever worked in retail?

961
00:58:05,715 --> 00:58:08,878
You know, selling... clothes.

962
00:58:08,952 --> 00:58:12,046
If I was selling clothes already,
what would I be doing here?

963
00:58:12,121 --> 00:58:15,352
I really don't think this is the right
way to start a working relationship.

964
00:58:15,425 --> 00:58:19,452
You got a real bad attitude, lady.
In tact, I don't even want your job.

965
00:58:19,529 --> 00:58:23,363
I don't care how much you'd pay me,
'cause I got integrity.

966
00:58:23,433 --> 00:58:24,991
In-tuckin'-tegrity!

967
00:58:27,770 --> 00:58:31,001
It's, like, impossible.
It's, like, the hardest thing.

968
00:58:31,074 --> 00:58:34,043
- There's nothing out there tor me.
- That's really tough.

969
00:58:34,110 --> 00:58:37,045
I'm a bum now.
That's what I do.

970
00:58:37,113 --> 00:58:38,876
- Here, man.
- Oh, hey.

971
00:58:39,582 --> 00:58:41,209
Thanks.

972
00:58:41,284 --> 00:58:43,218
- What about your parents?
- My parents?

973
00:58:43,286 --> 00:58:47,052
Oh, you mean my mom.
My mom is scared of me.

974
00:58:47,123 --> 00:58:49,318
She won't even let me in the house.

975
00:58:49,392 --> 00:58:52,884
It's not like I killed anybody
or hurt anybody, you know.

976
00:58:52,962 --> 00:58:55,226
- It's just, she's scared.
- Yeah.

977
00:58:57,433 --> 00:58:59,560
Hey, we gotta get outta here.

978
00:58:59,636 --> 00:59:03,072
I couldn't even look at the guy.
I felt a pain in my stomach.

979
00:59:03,139 --> 00:59:07,007
I didn't like it so I turned my back,
just like everybody else.

980
00:59:07,076 --> 00:59:09,237
- I'll see you guys in the rebound.
- On the rebound.

981
00:59:09,312 --> 00:59:11,610
Right.
On the rebound.

982
00:59:13,983 --> 00:59:15,917
It really fucked me up.

983
00:59:15,985 --> 00:59:18,249
Not Sean, but turning my back.

984
00:59:18,321 --> 00:59:20,721
Ignoring the truth.

985
00:59:20,790 --> 00:59:23,725
So what'd I do? I dropped acid
with Sandy in Highland Park...

986
00:59:23,793 --> 00:59:25,727
as to further ignore the truth.

987
00:59:25,795 --> 00:59:29,629
This shit is good. I got it trom Trish.
Trish got it from Mark.

988
00:59:29,699 --> 00:59:32,224
That's a weird couple...
Bob and Trish.

989
00:59:32,302 --> 00:59:35,533
- Do you think they're in love?
- Don't know.

990
00:59:35,605 --> 00:59:37,664
I'll have to ask them that.

991
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:40,004
- It's weird.
- What's that?

992
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:42,909
The park is so dead.

993
00:59:42,979 --> 00:59:45,607
- This town is dead.
- It's what?

994
00:59:45,682 --> 00:59:50,119
It's dead.
Dead, dead, dead, dead.

995
00:59:50,186 --> 00:59:51,619
Maybe we're dead.

996
00:59:51,688 --> 00:59:53,212
Wouldn't that be nice?

997
00:59:53,289 --> 00:59:56,622
That's the canyon where the devil
worshipers go. You wanna check it out?

998
01:00:00,163 --> 01:00:01,494
Look at the colors!

999
01:00:01,564 --> 01:00:04,795
You know, before the...
You know, before the...

1000
01:00:04,867 --> 01:00:07,165
before the Mormons
settled this valley...

1001
01:00:07,236 --> 01:00:09,170
this is where
the Donner Party came through.

1002
01:00:09,238 --> 01:00:11,502
- The cannibals?
- Yeah, the cannibals. Two families.

1003
01:00:12,709 --> 01:00:15,940
The head of the one tamily was right.
He said, "We should go south.

1004
01:00:16,012 --> 01:00:18,105
We shouldn't go over the mountains.

1005
01:00:18,181 --> 01:00:21,116
We should go down around the Sierras
and get to California."

1006
01:00:21,184 --> 01:00:24,984
They got in a tight, and this guy killed
one ot the members ot the Donner Party.

1007
01:00:25,054 --> 01:00:26,646
There was a raging battle.

1008
01:00:26,723 --> 01:00:29,749
They kicked him out. Outcast.
By himselt, alone in the wilderness.

1009
01:00:29,826 --> 01:00:33,956
He did it. He went around the Sierras
to Calitornia by himself.

1010
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:37,090
Alone in the wilderness,
to be by himselt.

1011
01:00:37,166 --> 01:00:41,102
That guy came back
and saved the Donner Party's ass...

1012
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:43,263
when they got snowed in.

1013
01:00:43,339 --> 01:00:46,536
Stevo! Come here!

1014
01:00:57,053 --> 01:00:58,850
Help me. I'm dying.

1015
01:00:59,889 --> 01:01:02,915
Feel me. Look.
I'm right here.

1016
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:04,789
I'm right here.
Feel me.

1017
01:01:04,861 --> 01:01:06,852
Do you feel me?
That's it.

1018
01:01:06,929 --> 01:01:09,056
They just threw him out
for him to die.

1019
01:01:09,132 --> 01:01:12,659
They threw him out while they're
sitting there eating themselves...

1020
01:01:23,479 --> 01:01:25,037
I can see everything!

1021
01:01:28,551 --> 01:01:31,145
What the tuck is happening to me?

1022
01:01:31,988 --> 01:01:35,014
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you're dying.

1023
01:01:35,091 --> 01:01:38,527
Why are you always dying?
Why is everyone dying?

1024
01:01:47,837 --> 01:01:49,930
I think the world will really end.

1025
01:01:50,006 --> 01:01:53,100
- Why do you say that?
- There's no place else for it to go.

1026
01:01:53,176 --> 01:01:56,111
You're right.
But when's it gonna end?

1027
01:01:56,179 --> 01:01:58,704
- That I can't tell you.
- No, that you must tell me.

1028
01:01:58,781 --> 01:02:00,043
I can't.

1029
01:02:00,116 --> 01:02:03,916
Come on, little cookie surprise.
Come with us!

1030
01:02:05,021 --> 01:02:06,955
- Please tell me.
- I can show you.

1031
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:14,856
It's beautitul, right?

1032
01:02:14,931 --> 01:02:18,128
As beautiful as it can be...

1033
01:02:18,201 --> 01:02:19,361
I guess.

1034
01:02:19,435 --> 01:02:21,926
Beautiful like you.

1035
01:02:22,004 --> 01:02:24,939
- You wanna see something else beautiful?
- Sure.

1036
01:02:31,347 --> 01:02:33,577
Beauty's the end, Stevo.

1037
01:02:33,649 --> 01:02:34,877
The end.

1038
01:02:48,097 --> 01:02:51,533
The question lingered in my mind
about Bob and Trish... were they in love?

1039
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:54,263
- So I thought I'd just ask outright.
- You guys in love?

1040
01:02:54,337 --> 01:02:56,498
- Who?
- You and Trish.

1041
01:02:56,572 --> 01:02:59,405
Oh. Uh, I don't know.

1042
01:02:59,475 --> 01:03:02,808
- I'll have to think about that.
- It's not really a thinking question.

1043
01:03:02,879 --> 01:03:04,938
Well, you know, I...

1044
01:03:05,014 --> 01:03:08,074
I worship her and all.
She's like a goddess.

1045
01:03:08,151 --> 01:03:10,085
It she died, I'd die.

1046
01:03:10,153 --> 01:03:13,589
It she told me to cut otf my left arm,
I'd probably do it.

1047
01:03:13,656 --> 01:03:16,716
It she told me to lick a cop's asshole,
I'd probably do it.

1048
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:19,023
All right, all right, I get it.

1049
01:03:19,095 --> 01:03:21,620
Yeah, I guess I love Trish.

1050
01:03:21,697 --> 01:03:24,825
It's weird, man.
I never thought I'd fall in love.

1051
01:03:24,901 --> 01:03:27,165
I was just wondering.

1052
01:03:27,236 --> 01:03:29,170
I always thought
you were a poser.

1053
01:03:29,238 --> 01:03:30,603
Why am I a poser?

1054
01:03:30,673 --> 01:03:33,767
Only posers tall in love with girls,
so you're a poser.

1055
01:03:33,843 --> 01:03:36,778
- Fine. I guess I'm a poser.
- That's what I just said.

1056
01:03:42,118 --> 01:03:44,382
I don't really think
you're a poser.

1057
01:03:44,453 --> 01:03:47,889
- I was just bustin' on you.
- I know, I know.

1058
01:03:47,957 --> 01:03:50,892
I didn't think
you thought I was.

1059
01:03:53,129 --> 01:03:56,496
Where were we going?
I mean, really, what was happening?

1060
01:03:56,566 --> 01:03:59,763
This lite, it was crazy.
And I felt tired.

1061
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:02,805
Haltway through the season,
inside I was so tired...

1062
01:04:02,872 --> 01:04:06,364
and I had this wave ot melancholy...

1063
01:04:06,442 --> 01:04:09,639
just, like, sweep through me...

1064
01:04:09,712 --> 01:04:11,703
and this impending sense...

1065
01:04:11,781 --> 01:04:15,683
that my philosophies... anarchy...
was talling apart.

1066
01:04:15,751 --> 01:04:18,686
What do you do when your foundation
talls apart? I don't know.

1067
01:04:18,754 --> 01:04:21,086
They don't teach you that
in school.

1068
01:04:21,157 --> 01:04:23,489
Then there was this party
at Chris's.

1069
01:04:23,559 --> 01:04:28,019
Chris lived on the outskirts ot town,
in suburbia, surrounded by Mormons.

1070
01:04:28,097 --> 01:04:31,032
His house was like a commune.
I told you about Chris earlier.

1071
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:34,433
At that tirst party
he had that sister Jenniter, red hair.

1072
01:04:34,503 --> 01:04:37,165
Remember her?
Really sexy. Carnivore.

1073
01:04:40,509 --> 01:04:42,807
You remember, right?
This is Jen.

1074
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:44,904
- Stevo, how you doing?
- Great. How you doin'?

1075
01:04:44,981 --> 01:04:48,280
Great. Great. I'm really doing...
I'm really doing well. Really.

1076
01:04:48,351 --> 01:04:51,650
- God, what are you on tonight?
- Nothing. That's exactly my point.

1077
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:55,657
I stopped taking my medications,
and everything feels so much better.

1078
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:59,718
Chris told me to stop taking them
'cause then I would believe in God...

1079
01:04:59,795 --> 01:05:01,729
and I would dissolve.

1080
01:05:01,797 --> 01:05:03,890
So I stopped,
'cause I'm really superstitious.

1081
01:05:03,966 --> 01:05:06,196
Everything is so much clearer
right now.

1082
01:05:06,269 --> 01:05:08,396
- Seriously. So pure.
- Right.

1083
01:05:08,471 --> 01:05:11,269
This is Jen,
looking a lot like Ophelia tonight.

1084
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:14,537
Chris's house was like a commune.
All the regulars were there.

1085
01:05:14,610 --> 01:05:17,272
Freaky Deaky,
Bob was hanging out with Trish.

1086
01:05:17,346 --> 01:05:20,315
Then there was Mike. He was quiet
all night. Sat in the corner.

1087
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:23,648
The whole party was weird.
This vibe was going on. Strange night.

1088
01:05:23,719 --> 01:05:27,382
Stevo, I see things clearly,
like my brother sees them.

1089
01:05:27,456 --> 01:05:29,890
- Where's your brother?
- Downstairs talking.

1090
01:05:29,959 --> 01:05:32,484
They talk all the time,
and it's so lame...

1091
01:05:32,561 --> 01:05:34,995
- I wanna go talk.
- No, no, no, no.

1092
01:05:51,047 --> 01:05:52,981
Definitely a hippie.

1093
01:05:53,049 --> 01:05:54,983
Hey. There you go.

1094
01:05:55,051 --> 01:05:58,452
I can't tell you
how good it is to see you.

1095
01:05:58,521 --> 01:06:00,955
My heart
has been so heavy, Stevo.

1096
01:06:06,062 --> 01:06:08,257
That's a mighty nice hookah.

1097
01:06:08,331 --> 01:06:11,266
I've been trying to get stoned,
but it won't happen.

1098
01:06:11,334 --> 01:06:13,268
I've been smoking
since I was born.

1099
01:06:13,336 --> 01:06:15,304
Why'd you tell Jenniter
to get oft her medication?

1100
01:06:15,371 --> 01:06:19,273
She is completely out ot her mind
when she's otf her medication.

1101
01:06:19,342 --> 01:06:22,539
Isn't she beautiful?
Have you seen her gown?

1102
01:06:22,611 --> 01:06:25,546
That's my sister.
She's not a Lithium Barbie doll.

1103
01:06:25,614 --> 01:06:27,980
- She needs to be who she is.
- Yes.

1104
01:06:28,050 --> 01:06:29,915
And she should be.

1105
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:32,147
- But who she is...
- Is evaporating.

1106
01:06:32,221 --> 01:06:34,314
I don't think
she knows who she is.

1107
01:06:34,390 --> 01:06:37,553
I think we're starting to talk
about pain here, Stevo.

1108
01:06:37,626 --> 01:06:39,560
A human being
must go through pain.

1109
01:06:39,628 --> 01:06:42,426
- What is Jones doing?
- Satanic bible.

1110
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:44,932
I'm gonna prove there's no Satan.

1111
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:46,593
He doesn't exist!

1112
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:50,036
He's going to try to summon the beast
tonight at midnight.

1113
01:06:50,106 --> 01:06:52,870
He isn't going to come,
and when he doesn't come...

1114
01:06:52,942 --> 01:06:56,139
Jones will have proved
that science is the only truth.

1115
01:06:56,212 --> 01:06:59,147
- Have you met my other sister?
- There's a lightning storm coming.

1116
01:06:59,215 --> 01:07:01,843
I need to get a picture ot it.
Hi, Stevo.

1117
01:07:01,917 --> 01:07:05,375
- That's my sister.
- Your whole tamily is a little strange.

1118
01:07:05,454 --> 01:07:08,048
Yes, but we are strange.

1119
01:07:08,124 --> 01:07:10,115
- Let's speak of anarchy.
- Yeah.

1120
01:07:10,192 --> 01:07:12,820
So we started our debate.
This was our custom.

1121
01:07:12,895 --> 01:07:15,728
He believed in structure,
I believed in chaos.

1122
01:07:15,798 --> 01:07:18,130
This was an ongoing fight.
He seemed to be winning.

1123
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:20,225
Parties are like this in Salt Lake
for us punks.

1124
01:07:20,302 --> 01:07:24,033
The days would pass. There would be
a party, then a fight, then another day.

1125
01:07:24,106 --> 01:07:27,405
This was the cycle.
It was getting old, though.

1126
01:07:27,476 --> 01:07:29,467
I was feeling old.

1127
01:07:29,545 --> 01:07:31,740
Anyway, it was a weird night.

1128
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:42,648
The school ot science says the world
moves trom order to disorder... chaos.

1129
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:45,159
They're tools, Stevo.

1130
01:07:45,227 --> 01:07:49,459
You know, lite goes trom order
to disorder to order.

1131
01:07:49,532 --> 01:07:52,467
Atoms come together randomly
to torm a structure.

1132
01:07:52,535 --> 01:07:54,469
- An intant is born...
- A child, yeah.

1133
01:07:54,537 --> 01:07:58,166
Exactly. It grows, it gets older,
it dies, it decomposes.

1134
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:00,834
- Exactly.
- Back into chaos.

1135
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:02,537
Exactly. Anarchy.

1136
01:08:02,611 --> 01:08:06,980
But then those atoms are reformed
into something else.

1137
01:08:07,049 --> 01:08:11,486
A blade ot grass, a tree,
a tlower, whatever... the cycle, man.

1138
01:08:11,554 --> 01:08:13,283
I got it.

1139
01:08:19,261 --> 01:08:21,491
The cycle, man.

1140
01:08:23,032 --> 01:08:26,092
Yeah, I get you.
The cycle.

1141
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:28,395
The time is now!

1142
01:08:28,471 --> 01:08:31,065
I'm gonna go out
and I'm gonna prove...

1143
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:34,769
that all your faith and all your prayers
are untounded!

1144
01:08:34,844 --> 01:08:36,573
You comin'?

1145
01:08:36,645 --> 01:08:39,580
- Is he serious?
- He's always serious, Stevo.

1146
01:08:39,648 --> 01:08:42,082
I'm gonna go watch.
I'll see you later.

1147
01:08:43,452 --> 01:08:46,615
- I treasure these talks, Stevo.
- Not as much as I do.

1148
01:08:46,689 --> 01:08:49,624
We've got science to celebrate
and demons to dispel.

1149
01:08:49,692 --> 01:08:51,626
Ott your butt, Pippy!

1150
01:08:51,694 --> 01:08:54,629
We're gonna go show that science
is the only truth!

1151
01:08:54,697 --> 01:08:57,063
- I think we're gonna cut.
- This makes me uncomtortable.

1152
01:08:57,133 --> 01:08:59,829
He shouldn't be playing
with something he doesn't know.

1153
01:08:59,902 --> 01:09:04,464
I don't blame you. I'll get a ride home
with Sandy. Have you guys seen her?

1154
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:06,838
- I saw her in the back earlier.
- So did I.

1155
01:09:06,909 --> 01:09:09,036
All right, I'll see you later.

1156
01:09:13,716 --> 01:09:16,310
What?

1157
01:09:16,385 --> 01:09:18,285
What do you want?

1158
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:27,227
It wasn't that I loved Sandy.
I knew that we had an understanding.

1159
01:09:27,296 --> 01:09:31,062
I discovered then that Chris was right...
all things had systems, even me.

1160
01:09:31,133 --> 01:09:34,728
I was about to beat the shit out of this
guy because he had invaded my territory.

1161
01:09:34,803 --> 01:09:38,671
It was my territory, no question
about it, just like in the wild.

1162
01:09:38,741 --> 01:09:42,404
I was following nature, nature was order
and order is the system.

1163
01:09:45,514 --> 01:09:48,881
- Shut the fuck up!
- Stop it! Stop it!

1164
01:09:50,953 --> 01:09:54,013
Get otf me!
Get the tuck otf me!

1165
01:09:58,928 --> 01:10:03,558
You're such a fuckin' pussy.
What the tuck did you do that tor?

1166
01:10:03,632 --> 01:10:05,566
Fuck you.

1167
01:10:10,272 --> 01:10:14,834
In the name of Satan, ruler ot the Earth
and king of the underworld...

1168
01:10:14,910 --> 01:10:18,710
I command the forces ot darkness
to dispel their internal...

1169
01:10:18,781 --> 01:10:21,716
Jones didn't need to prove
the devil did not exist...

1170
01:10:21,784 --> 01:10:23,718
not as a supernatural being...

1171
01:10:23,786 --> 01:10:26,812
because I had seen the devil.

1172
01:10:26,889 --> 01:10:32,521
He was in that room with Sandy. He was
me, Harvard, my mom and dad, all of us.

1173
01:10:32,595 --> 01:10:35,758
Jones was just making
all of this up anyway, so who cared?

1174
01:10:35,831 --> 01:10:39,096
"Fuck 'em," I thought.
"Fuck him, fuck this party...

1175
01:10:39,168 --> 01:10:41,261
and fuck everything.

1176
01:10:41,337 --> 01:10:44,431
Above all, fuck anarchy."

1177
01:10:46,842 --> 01:10:49,504
I don't know,
we were, like, just kickin' it...

1178
01:10:49,578 --> 01:10:51,773
smokin' cigarettes and...

1179
01:10:51,847 --> 01:10:55,874
Trish had, like,
candy corn, dude, and...

1180
01:10:55,951 --> 01:11:00,149
We were just watching birds and shit
and I just started thinking...

1181
01:11:00,222 --> 01:11:03,089
Salt Lake
ain't that bad, you know.

1182
01:11:03,158 --> 01:11:05,319
You know what I'm sayin'?

1183
01:11:05,394 --> 01:11:07,328
I know it sucks and all...

1184
01:11:07,396 --> 01:11:11,594
but, you know,
this is, like, home, you know.

1185
01:11:11,667 --> 01:11:13,601
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1186
01:11:13,669 --> 01:11:16,729
All I'm saying is,
it you think about it...

1187
01:11:16,805 --> 01:11:19,239
no matter where you go
you gotta have a home...

1188
01:11:19,308 --> 01:11:22,243
and Salt Lake is, like,
home.

1189
01:11:27,383 --> 01:11:30,318
- This place is never gonna be my home.
- I'm just saying...

1190
01:11:30,386 --> 01:11:33,321
No, you said
what you were gonna say.

1191
01:11:35,257 --> 01:11:37,691
Get it?
Now you tuckin' listen.

1192
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:40,160
Look at this fuckin' place.
It's a shit hole!

1193
01:11:40,229 --> 01:11:43,392
Look out there and tell me
what you see. Nothin'!

1194
01:11:43,465 --> 01:11:45,831
Nothin' piled upon
tucking nothin'.

1195
01:11:45,901 --> 01:11:49,098
It's like Jesus Christ took a shit
and it landed right here!

1196
01:11:49,171 --> 01:11:52,629
So you can be happy
all you fuckin' want. All right?

1197
01:11:52,708 --> 01:11:55,643
I used to think we were alike,
we were similar.

1198
01:11:55,711 --> 01:12:00,205
We had something together, like this.
We thought alike, we telt the same way.

1199
01:12:00,282 --> 01:12:02,273
But you...

1200
01:12:02,351 --> 01:12:03,841
Fuck you.

1201
01:12:04,953 --> 01:12:07,945
Grow up, Bobby.
Look around and grow up.

1202
01:12:09,491 --> 01:12:13,427
'Cause I swear to God, man,
I'll tuckin' write you otf like that.

1203
01:12:16,432 --> 01:12:19,595
This is your home?
You know what? Fuck your home.

1204
01:12:32,414 --> 01:12:36,714
And this city was still the same. Just
look like it. There's nothing going on.

1205
01:12:36,785 --> 01:12:40,448
That's what I saw when I looked out
over the city... nothin'.

1206
01:12:40,522 --> 01:12:43,457
How the Mormon settlers
looked upon this valley...

1207
01:12:43,525 --> 01:12:46,460
and felt that it was the promised land
is beyond me.

1208
01:12:46,528 --> 01:12:48,689
Maybe it looked different
back then.

1209
01:13:06,281 --> 01:13:08,841
Look at this thing, this temple.

1210
01:13:08,917 --> 01:13:12,182
When I was 7 and we moved here,
Mom and Dad told me this was Disneyland.

1211
01:13:12,254 --> 01:13:17,214
Righttully so. Been livin' with Mickey,
Donald and the whole crew since.

1212
01:13:17,292 --> 01:13:20,227
And now Mike, a good friend of mine,
was gettin' out.

1213
01:13:20,295 --> 01:13:21,887
What?

1214
01:13:21,964 --> 01:13:24,762
I'm leaving.
I'm going to Notre Dame.

1215
01:13:24,833 --> 01:13:28,701
- How could you do that?
- I'm 18. I gotta go to college.

1216
01:13:28,771 --> 01:13:32,901
Mike, I'm gonna miss you, man.
It's gonna suck around here without you.

1217
01:13:32,975 --> 01:13:35,569
- What's you major gonna be, dude?
- Botany.

1218
01:13:35,644 --> 01:13:37,942
- What's that?
- Plants.

1219
01:13:38,013 --> 01:13:40,038
You're gonna study plants.

1220
01:13:40,115 --> 01:13:42,208
I wanna save the rain forests.

1221
01:13:42,284 --> 01:13:44,479
Somebody's gotta tight for them.

1222
01:13:47,756 --> 01:13:49,690
Do you believe this guy?

1223
01:13:49,758 --> 01:13:51,885
He's going oft to save the plants.

1224
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:56,897
This guy was one ot the most
hard-core sons ot bitches I ever met...

1225
01:13:56,965 --> 01:13:59,900
and he's going otf
to save the plants.

1226
01:14:01,870 --> 01:14:04,498
I remember this time
he was drunk...

1227
01:14:04,573 --> 01:14:08,373
and he got the idea in his head
that all the cars on his block...

1228
01:14:08,444 --> 01:14:10,378
would look better without windows.

1229
01:14:27,529 --> 01:14:29,622
Get down, bitch!

1230
01:14:30,432 --> 01:14:32,161
He took 'em all on.

1231
01:14:32,234 --> 01:14:33,531
They needed to call backup.

1232
01:14:33,602 --> 01:14:37,038
Finally they got him
in the back of a squad car.

1233
01:14:43,212 --> 01:14:46,579
The cops thought he was on angel dust...
"The only way you could do it."

1234
01:14:46,648 --> 01:14:48,741
Not so.
It was just Mike.

1235
01:14:48,817 --> 01:14:52,548
He broke those goddamn handcuffs,
kicked the window out of the car, drunk.

1236
01:14:52,621 --> 01:14:54,646
That's it.
Never got caught either.

1237
01:14:54,723 --> 01:14:56,657
Story was all over the papers.

1238
01:14:56,725 --> 01:15:01,458
It took weeks for us to get him to admit
that it was him that had done it.

1239
01:15:01,530 --> 01:15:03,521
Now he's going off to hug a tree.

1240
01:15:03,599 --> 01:15:05,863
I kind of knew it was the end.

1241
01:15:05,934 --> 01:15:08,266
All that was lett was Bob and me.

1242
01:15:08,337 --> 01:15:10,271
First two punks.

1243
01:15:10,339 --> 01:15:12,068
The last two punks.

1244
01:15:13,075 --> 01:15:16,340
Then again, I was getting the impression
I was all that was left.

1245
01:15:16,411 --> 01:15:17,878
Bob was in love.

1246
01:15:17,946 --> 01:15:21,313
Stevo, I want to introduce you
to a young friend of mine.

1247
01:15:21,383 --> 01:15:23,317
I think you'd like her.

1248
01:15:23,385 --> 01:15:25,319
Yeah?
Why do you think that?

1249
01:15:26,655 --> 01:15:28,520
I don't know.

1250
01:15:28,590 --> 01:15:30,581
She's smart...

1251
01:15:30,659 --> 01:15:32,149
and she's ambitious.

1252
01:15:32,227 --> 01:15:35,162
- I'm not ambitious.
- Not yet, dude.

1253
01:15:40,435 --> 01:15:43,370
I love you.
Bob loves you.

1254
01:15:45,874 --> 01:15:48,308
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

1255
01:15:48,377 --> 01:15:50,675
Nothing's the matter.
I'm right as rain.

1256
01:15:50,746 --> 01:15:53,044
Why are you always depressed
all the time?

1257
01:15:53,115 --> 01:15:55,049
I'm not depressed.

1258
01:15:57,386 --> 01:15:59,479
I think Sandy really got you.

1259
01:16:00,589 --> 01:16:02,022
No.

1260
01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:05,659
You know, dude,
it's no big deal.

1261
01:16:06,762 --> 01:16:09,697
You're like my brother...

1262
01:16:09,765 --> 01:16:11,699
and I love you and all.

1263
01:16:11,767 --> 01:16:14,702
But what that fucking bitch did,
you should fucking kill her.

1264
01:16:14,770 --> 01:16:16,704
She had the right.

1265
01:16:16,772 --> 01:16:19,707
She had the right.
It was the agreement.

1266
01:16:21,777 --> 01:16:23,711
Should've been more caretul.

1267
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:27,314
That Stevo's got a big heart.

1268
01:16:27,382 --> 01:16:29,873
I don't have a big heart, Trish.

1269
01:16:29,952 --> 01:16:33,285
I have a heart
the size ot a pea.

1270
01:16:33,355 --> 01:16:35,789
It's okay, though.
I mean, you guys are...

1271
01:16:37,359 --> 01:16:39,293
You guys are happy.
That's okay.

1272
01:16:40,462 --> 01:16:42,396
Please just don't pity me.

1273
01:16:43,632 --> 01:16:47,363
Hey, Bob, tell her
I get otf on pain, please.

1274
01:16:47,436 --> 01:16:49,700
Yeah, he does, you know.

1275
01:16:49,771 --> 01:16:52,865
I've mellowed out a lot,
but Stevo's tuckin' hard-core.

1276
01:16:54,343 --> 01:16:58,370
Hard-core or not,
I think he should meet Brandy.

1277
01:16:58,447 --> 01:17:01,382
She's having a party
at her parents' next week.

1278
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:04,112
Yeah!
She's a rich girl, dude.

1279
01:17:04,186 --> 01:17:06,450
That's okay.

1280
01:17:06,521 --> 01:17:08,455
I'm a rich boy, right?

1281
01:17:08,523 --> 01:17:11,583
Yeah, but you're
a cool rich boy.

1282
01:17:11,660 --> 01:17:14,686
I don't know about that
anymore, but...

1283
01:17:14,763 --> 01:17:17,254
Brandy.
That sounds kinda tun.

1284
01:17:17,332 --> 01:17:18,765
Yeah?

1285
01:17:24,306 --> 01:17:26,570
See?

1286
01:17:26,642 --> 01:17:28,701
Nothing.

1287
01:17:28,777 --> 01:17:31,337
Miles ot nothing.
Just space.

1288
01:17:33,115 --> 01:17:36,050
You could tall in
and never come out.

1289
01:17:37,519 --> 01:17:39,453
So it came to this...

1290
01:17:39,521 --> 01:17:42,251
a blind date, my first.

1291
01:17:42,324 --> 01:17:45,293
What the hell. I didn't want to
let them down. They were good people.

1292
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:49,353
The thing was, I didn't need a date.
I needed an answer.

1293
01:17:49,431 --> 01:17:52,923
The year was a waste, all right, but
not the kind of waste I was looking for.

1294
01:17:53,001 --> 01:17:58,906
Not a glorious wastefulness filled
with parties and fights and good sex.

1295
01:17:58,974 --> 01:18:00,908
No.

1296
01:18:00,976 --> 01:18:03,206
Instead...

1297
01:18:03,278 --> 01:18:06,509
it was more like the waste...

1298
01:18:06,581 --> 01:18:08,845
that is the salt flats.

1299
01:18:24,966 --> 01:18:27,491
What are we doing here?

1300
01:18:27,569 --> 01:18:29,503
It's his birthday, dude.

1301
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:34,141
Oh, yeah?

1302
01:18:35,310 --> 01:18:37,244
How old is he?

1303
01:18:38,380 --> 01:18:40,405
I don't know.

1304
01:18:40,482 --> 01:18:42,780
I don't think he knows.

1305
01:18:42,851 --> 01:18:45,786
He's old, though.
I know that.

1306
01:18:47,355 --> 01:18:50,290
You wanna look presentable
for your old man.

1307
01:18:58,233 --> 01:19:00,463
Aren't you gonna wake him up?

1308
01:19:00,535 --> 01:19:02,526
I don't know.
What do you think?

1309
01:19:02,604 --> 01:19:05,198
I don't know, man.
It's your dad.

1310
01:19:05,273 --> 01:19:09,573
Yeah, I know. It's just, you know,
he's kinda crazy sometimes.

1311
01:19:09,644 --> 01:19:11,077
What do you mean?

1312
01:19:13,682 --> 01:19:16,651
I mean, he thinks
the CIA's atter him and stutf.

1313
01:19:16,718 --> 01:19:19,846
What the hell do you want?

1314
01:19:19,921 --> 01:19:22,287
- What do you want with me?
- Dad, it's me.

1315
01:19:22,357 --> 01:19:24,222
It's Bob.

1316
01:19:24,292 --> 01:19:25,919
Your son.

1317
01:19:25,994 --> 01:19:27,723
Happy birthday.

1318
01:19:29,197 --> 01:19:33,827
How do you know it's my birthday?
You people know everything.

1319
01:19:33,902 --> 01:19:37,303
What the hell do you want?
I don't know anything.

1320
01:19:37,372 --> 01:19:41,001
Now you're in trouble.
This is my house, you dummies.

1321
01:19:41,076 --> 01:19:44,477
I was born here! I'm an American!
This is my piece ot the pie!

1322
01:19:44,546 --> 01:19:48,175
I don't give a shit who sent ya.
I'm gonna blow your goddamn heads ott.

1323
01:19:53,388 --> 01:19:56,755
Next time you'd better
bring back the army.

1324
01:19:56,825 --> 01:19:58,486
Goddamn CIA.

1325
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:01,188
In all those years
I had never met Bob's dad...

1326
01:20:01,263 --> 01:20:04,198
but I suddenly felt
I knew my friend a lot better.

1327
01:20:04,266 --> 01:20:06,791
I felt bad for him.
I didn't like that feeling.

1328
01:20:06,868 --> 01:20:09,462
He's kind of a lunatic,
you know.

1329
01:20:09,538 --> 01:20:11,472
Yeah, I'll say.

1330
01:20:17,145 --> 01:20:18,578
Sorry.

1331
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:23,684
Don't be.

1332
01:20:25,287 --> 01:20:27,221
It's not your fault.

1333
01:20:28,490 --> 01:20:30,651
You're my triend, that's all.

1334
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:34,094
I'm sorry.

1335
01:20:37,833 --> 01:20:40,768
It was the last party of my youth
and I was to meet Brandy.

1336
01:20:40,836 --> 01:20:44,602
I'm gonna say it right here, people...
Brandy was the woman I was gonna marry.

1337
01:20:44,673 --> 01:20:47,608
I didn't know it then.
Didn't even know what she was like.

1338
01:20:47,676 --> 01:20:50,770
I wasn't even sure if I was gay,
asexual, a punk, a mod...

1339
01:20:50,846 --> 01:20:52,939
my dad, Bob, Sean the beggar.

1340
01:20:53,014 --> 01:20:55,505
I didn't know
a goddamn thing that night.

1341
01:20:55,584 --> 01:20:58,519
If I knew what was ahead of me,
I may have stayed in bed...

1342
01:20:58,587 --> 01:21:00,578
or I may have felt better
about that night.

1343
01:21:00,655 --> 01:21:04,716
Life is like that.
We change, that's all.

1344
01:21:04,793 --> 01:21:08,194
You see, the guy I am now
is not the guy I was then.

1345
01:21:08,263 --> 01:21:11,255
If the guy I was then
met the guy I am now...

1346
01:21:11,333 --> 01:21:13,267
he'd beat the shit out of me.

1347
01:21:13,335 --> 01:21:15,462
Those are the facts.

1348
01:21:15,537 --> 01:21:18,665
But still I lied awake.

1349
01:21:18,740 --> 01:21:20,901
Was I afraid?

1350
01:21:20,976 --> 01:21:23,410
Was I angry?

1351
01:21:24,546 --> 01:21:27,208
Or was it just the end?

1352
01:21:27,282 --> 01:21:28,715
Hmm?

1353
01:21:28,783 --> 01:21:31,718
Was it just the end
and I knew it?

1354
01:21:31,786 --> 01:21:34,880
On and on and on

1355
01:21:34,956 --> 01:21:37,322
Canadian Club, love

1356
01:21:37,392 --> 01:21:39,360
A place in the country

1357
01:21:39,427 --> 01:21:42,555
Everyone's ideal

1358
01:21:43,965 --> 01:21:46,832
But you are my tavorita

1359
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:51,236
And a place in your heart, dear
makes me feel more

1360
01:21:51,306 --> 01:21:53,740
Real

1361
01:21:53,808 --> 01:21:56,743
Oh, mother of pearl

1362
01:21:56,811 --> 01:22:01,009
I wouldn't change you
for the whole world

1363
01:22:06,521 --> 01:22:08,079
Stevo, this is Brandy.

1364
01:22:09,190 --> 01:22:12,353
Come on in, you guys.
Drinks in the back.

1365
01:22:12,427 --> 01:22:16,261
It was the hardest punch I ever took.
Knocked the wind right out of me.

1366
01:22:16,331 --> 01:22:19,596
I was hers.
That was it. One smile.

1367
01:22:21,336 --> 01:22:23,930
We got acquainted
as the party raged around us.

1368
01:22:24,005 --> 01:22:26,235
I have to ask you something.

1369
01:22:26,308 --> 01:22:28,242
Yeah, go ahead. Ask me.

1370
01:22:28,310 --> 01:22:32,644
Well, why do you go out ot your way
to look like a bum?

1371
01:22:32,714 --> 01:22:34,739
I look like a bum?

1372
01:22:34,816 --> 01:22:36,613
Not in a bad way.

1373
01:22:36,685 --> 01:22:40,314
I look like a bum
in a good way.

1374
01:22:40,388 --> 01:22:43,221
Aren't you, like,
rebelling against society?

1375
01:22:43,291 --> 01:22:44,622
Put that simply, kinda, yeah.

1376
01:22:44,693 --> 01:22:48,026
Hey, Brandy!
What's goin' on?

1377
01:22:48,096 --> 01:22:51,327
- What are you doin' with this fucker?
- Just talking.

1378
01:22:51,399 --> 01:22:52,866
Shit!

1379
01:22:52,934 --> 01:22:54,094
See you later.

1380
01:22:55,403 --> 01:22:56,836
You were saying?

1381
01:22:56,905 --> 01:23:00,272
Wouldn't it be more
of an act of rebellion...

1382
01:23:00,342 --> 01:23:03,971
it you didn't spend so much time
buying blue hair dye...

1383
01:23:04,045 --> 01:23:06,980
and going out
to get punky clothes?

1384
01:23:07,048 --> 01:23:08,310
It seems so petty.

1385
01:23:08,383 --> 01:23:10,851
Stop me it I'm being oftensive.

1386
01:23:10,919 --> 01:23:14,150
Oh, no, go right ahead.
It's... No, it's tine.

1387
01:23:14,222 --> 01:23:16,315
You wanna be an individual, right?

1388
01:23:16,391 --> 01:23:19,519
You look like you're wearing a unitorm.
You look like a punk.

1389
01:23:19,594 --> 01:23:22,461
That's not rebellion.
That's fashion.

1390
01:23:22,530 --> 01:23:25,693
- Then what's rebellion?
- Rebellion happens in the mind.

1391
01:23:25,767 --> 01:23:29,669
You can't create it.
You just are that way.

1392
01:23:30,739 --> 01:23:32,604
Right.

1393
01:23:32,674 --> 01:23:33,936
How old are you?

1394
01:23:34,676 --> 01:23:38,407
I'm 19. What does that
have to do with anything?

1395
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:41,881
Nothing. I was just...
I was just wondering.

1396
01:23:41,950 --> 01:23:43,850
What you're basically saying...

1397
01:23:43,918 --> 01:23:48,719
is that you wouldn't like a guy like me
because I have silly hair...

1398
01:23:49,958 --> 01:23:52,518
and I dress kinda funny, right?

1399
01:23:52,594 --> 01:23:54,585
No, not at all.

1400
01:23:54,662 --> 01:23:56,596
I like you, actually.

1401
01:23:58,466 --> 01:24:00,900
I mean, we just met.

1402
01:24:00,969 --> 01:24:04,837
This is my party,
and I'm hanging out with you all night.

1403
01:24:08,176 --> 01:24:11,509
Wear what you want.
I don't care about things like that.

1404
01:24:11,579 --> 01:24:16,414
I was just posing a theory...

1405
01:24:16,484 --> 01:24:19,044
and trying to understand.

1406
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:21,520
So...

1407
01:24:21,589 --> 01:24:24,080
then you do like me.

1408
01:24:26,594 --> 01:24:28,892
Mildly.

1409
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:47,480
What was I doing?
What was I, an asshole?

1410
01:24:47,549 --> 01:24:50,040
I was in love,
and I just met this person.

1411
01:24:50,118 --> 01:24:52,882
I hated her ideas
because they were critical of me...

1412
01:24:52,954 --> 01:24:55,184
but I loved her anyway.

1413
01:24:55,256 --> 01:24:59,716
It was a curse. No, it was a punishment.
I went with it. We talked all night.

1414
01:25:06,434 --> 01:25:08,026
You okay?

1415
01:25:09,270 --> 01:25:11,704
I got a headache.

1416
01:25:11,773 --> 01:25:14,708
I gotta go to the bathroom.

1417
01:25:17,612 --> 01:25:19,637
Bob! How goes it?

1418
01:25:19,714 --> 01:25:21,272
What's goin' on?

1419
01:25:21,349 --> 01:25:23,909
- I got a fuckin' headache.
- I have some pills tor that.

1420
01:25:23,985 --> 01:25:26,715
This fuckin' music...
No, I don't take pills, dude.

1421
01:25:26,788 --> 01:25:29,222
- It's candy.
- They're just vitamins.

1422
01:25:38,032 --> 01:25:39,966
Headache in a bottle?

1423
01:26:00,722 --> 01:26:02,690
- What'd you do?
- I don't like the mirror.

1424
01:26:02,757 --> 01:26:04,156
What happened?

1425
01:26:04,225 --> 01:26:07,092
I don't like tucking mirrors!
All right?

1426
01:26:08,596 --> 01:26:10,587
- You're drunk, Bob.
- I'm sorry.

1427
01:26:10,665 --> 01:26:12,292
What did he do?

1428
01:26:12,367 --> 01:26:15,666
He gets crazy when he's drunk,
that's all.

1429
01:26:16,905 --> 01:26:19,430
- Everybody out.
- That's it. Party's over.

1430
01:26:19,507 --> 01:26:20,769
Out, out, out.

1431
01:26:20,842 --> 01:26:24,005
I'm sorry about that window.
I didn't mean to...

1432
01:26:24,078 --> 01:26:26,774
I'll buy you a new one.

1433
01:26:26,848 --> 01:26:30,511
- No, I'll tell them it was an accident.
- It's seven years bad luck.

1434
01:26:30,585 --> 01:26:33,452
No, it's seven years bad luck.
It's seven years bad luck!

1435
01:26:33,521 --> 01:26:37,048
All right, I'll take him home.
I'll get him out of here.

1436
01:26:37,125 --> 01:26:38,683
Where are we going?

1437
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:40,193
Let's go.

1438
01:26:40,261 --> 01:26:42,456
All right, you guys.
Everything's cool.

1439
01:26:42,530 --> 01:26:45,465
- Can I call you tomorrow?
- No.

1440
01:26:45,533 --> 01:26:48,661
I mean, yeah.
That'd be cool.

1441
01:26:48,736 --> 01:26:50,897
Yeah, okay.

1442
01:26:50,972 --> 01:26:52,064
Good.

1443
01:26:53,775 --> 01:26:57,040
Sorry. I had a great time tonight.
I really did.

1444
01:26:57,111 --> 01:26:58,908
Me too.

1445
01:26:58,980 --> 01:27:01,039
Great time.
Great party.

1446
01:27:01,115 --> 01:27:02,912
Yeah.

1447
01:27:02,984 --> 01:27:04,417
How you feeling, buddy?

1448
01:27:06,020 --> 01:27:08,955
Dude, I'm not like my dad,
you know.

1449
01:27:10,758 --> 01:27:13,852
I'm not gonna cry, dude.
You know what I mean?

1450
01:27:15,296 --> 01:27:16,923
Fine. Don't cry.

1451
01:27:17,999 --> 01:27:20,433
You think I let him down?

1452
01:27:20,501 --> 01:27:23,436
- Think I let my dad down?
- No.

1453
01:27:23,504 --> 01:27:25,438
If anything, he let you down.

1454
01:27:31,145 --> 01:27:33,079
I wanna marry Trish.

1455
01:27:35,850 --> 01:27:37,374
I'm serious, dude.

1456
01:27:37,452 --> 01:27:38,783
Yeah, all right.

1457
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:08,979
Come on!
Jesus Christ.

1458
01:28:10,652 --> 01:28:14,588
I swear to God,
you're like a high school girl.

1459
01:28:17,392 --> 01:28:19,826
Jesus Christ.

1460
01:28:19,894 --> 01:28:21,919
Good night, asshole.

1461
01:28:31,506 --> 01:28:33,440
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1462
01:28:33,508 --> 01:28:34,770
Bobby, get up.

1463
01:28:34,842 --> 01:28:37,777
Get up. It's, like, 3:00.
Let's get something to eat.

1464
01:28:56,898 --> 01:28:59,332
Oh, fuck.

1465
01:29:07,241 --> 01:29:08,674
God.

1466
01:29:25,193 --> 01:29:27,127
Fuckin' poser.

1467
01:29:28,529 --> 01:29:31,987
Only posers die, you tucking idiot!

1468
01:29:35,236 --> 01:29:38,171
Now what am I gonna do
for a triend?

1469
01:29:41,776 --> 01:29:44,404
You're my only triend!

1470
01:29:45,613 --> 01:29:48,275
Please wake up now!

1471
01:29:50,318 --> 01:29:52,309
Please! I'm sorry!

1472
01:29:59,460 --> 01:30:01,394
Oh, tuck.

1473
01:30:08,202 --> 01:30:12,366
Oh, man. Oh, jeez.

1474
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:14,374
Oh, my God.

1475
01:30:16,310 --> 01:30:18,744
I wasn't ready tor this.

1476
01:30:20,581 --> 01:30:22,515
I wasn't ready.

1477
01:30:23,851 --> 01:30:26,115
And we put him under the ground.

1478
01:30:26,187 --> 01:30:28,178
The official cause of death?

1479
01:30:28,256 --> 01:30:29,746
Overdose from Percodan.

1480
01:30:29,824 --> 01:30:32,759
That's what John's girlfriend
gave him for his headache.

1481
01:30:32,827 --> 01:30:35,022
That, mixed with the booze,
did him in.

1482
01:30:35,096 --> 01:30:38,964
Heroin Bob, the guy who never did
any drug in his life outside of beer...

1483
01:30:39,033 --> 01:30:41,866
died from a narcotic overdose.

1484
01:30:41,936 --> 01:30:43,801
And that was it.

1485
01:30:43,871 --> 01:30:45,463
He fell...

1486
01:30:45,540 --> 01:30:47,474
and I went on.

1487
01:30:47,542 --> 01:30:49,476
What else was I gonna do?

1488
01:30:49,544 --> 01:30:53,173
Bob got me into this whole punk-fashion
anarchy trip in the first place.

1489
01:30:53,247 --> 01:30:56,182
It hit me after the funeral.
It was always Bob.

1490
01:30:56,250 --> 01:30:59,947
Started way back when we were kids,
maybe 14.

1491
01:31:01,088 --> 01:31:03,022
We were such losers back then.

1492
01:31:03,090 --> 01:31:05,456
Those guys that sat alone
in the cafeteria...

1493
01:31:05,526 --> 01:31:07,460
getting shit from the jocks...

1494
01:31:07,528 --> 01:31:10,691
wishing to God they could be cool
for just, like, one minute.

1495
01:31:10,765 --> 01:31:13,165
Then one day Bob had had enough.

1496
01:31:13,234 --> 01:31:17,068
Being a dweeb was not
what he had in mind for our future.

1497
01:31:17,271 --> 01:31:21,264
- Hey, Bob. You're early.
- Dad was tlipping out. I had to leave.

1498
01:31:21,342 --> 01:31:25,301
Mike and Eddie are coming, so it should
be a good game. I have a good dungeon.

1499
01:31:25,379 --> 01:31:29,179
Stevo, this D&D shit,
it sucks.

1500
01:31:29,250 --> 01:31:31,411
- What?
- It sucks.

1501
01:31:31,486 --> 01:31:36,788
But you're a seventh-level magic user.
It's going great tor your character.

1502
01:31:36,858 --> 01:31:40,851
Stevo, it's bullshit, though.
"Magic user." What the hell's that?

1503
01:31:40,928 --> 01:31:44,193
These elves and dwarves
and dragons, man.

1504
01:31:44,265 --> 01:31:46,790
- This music...
- Rush is a very good band.

1505
01:31:46,868 --> 01:31:49,029
Their music is very complex,
and the pertection...

1506
01:31:49,103 --> 01:31:52,766
I'm not saying they're not talented,
and, yeah, they rock...

1507
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:54,774
but it's not the only music
out there.

1508
01:31:54,842 --> 01:31:57,436
- I've got a John Denver record.
- I'm serious.

1509
01:31:57,512 --> 01:32:00,345
Anyway, I like them.
They rock, man.

1510
01:32:00,414 --> 01:32:03,850
There's a whole world out there.
People are having fun.

1511
01:32:03,918 --> 01:32:06,045
We should be going to parties...

1512
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:07,951
getting drunk, getting laid...

1513
01:32:08,022 --> 01:32:09,353
being wild.

1514
01:32:09,423 --> 01:32:12,392
The last time we went to a party
we got our asses kicked.

1515
01:32:12,460 --> 01:32:15,190
Maybe we should have
our own parties.

1516
01:32:15,263 --> 01:32:19,063
- How about we turn this oft...
- Don't touch my stereo, Bob.

1517
01:32:19,133 --> 01:32:20,794
Give me a chance.

1518
01:32:22,803 --> 01:32:25,567
- Got this from a guy I know in L.A.
- You know a guy in L.A.?

1519
01:32:25,640 --> 01:32:27,073
Shh!

1520
01:32:32,113 --> 01:32:35,048
You tell me
it this doesn't rock.

1521
01:32:39,587 --> 01:32:41,020
This isn't anything.

1522
01:32:41,088 --> 01:32:43,420
Just give it a chance.

1523
01:32:45,126 --> 01:32:46,957
What is it?

1524
01:32:47,028 --> 01:32:49,656
- What is it?
- Yeah, what is it, Bob?

1525
01:32:52,366 --> 01:32:54,300
It's new.

1526
01:33:16,357 --> 01:33:17,790
Okay.

1527
01:33:26,901 --> 01:33:27,833
So there I was.

1528
01:33:27,902 --> 01:33:30,564
I was gonna go to Harvard.
It was obvious.

1529
01:33:30,638 --> 01:33:34,005
I was gonna be a lawyer
and play in the goddamn system.

1530
01:33:34,075 --> 01:33:35,906
That was that.

1531
01:33:35,977 --> 01:33:37,911
I was my old man.
He knew.

1532
01:33:37,979 --> 01:33:41,608
So what else could I do?
I mean, there's no future in anarchy.

1533
01:33:41,682 --> 01:33:44,810
But when I was into it
there was never a thought of the future.

1534
01:33:44,885 --> 01:33:48,946
We were certain the world was gonna end.
When it didn't, I had to do something.

1535
01:33:49,023 --> 01:33:50,513
So fuck it.

1536
01:33:50,591 --> 01:33:54,049
I could be a litigator in New York
and piss the shit out of the judges.

1537
01:33:54,128 --> 01:33:56,892
I mean, that was me...
a troublemaker, the future...

1538
01:33:56,964 --> 01:34:01,560
one of those guys my parents
so arrogantly saved the world for...

1539
01:34:01,636 --> 01:34:03,729
so we could fuck it up.

1540
01:34:03,804 --> 01:34:07,763
I could do a hell of a lot more damage
in the system than outside of it.

1541
01:34:07,842 --> 01:34:10,436
That was the final irony, I think.

1542
01:34:10,511 --> 01:34:13,036
That and, well, this.

1543
01:34:13,114 --> 01:34:15,446
And fuck you
if you're already thinking it.

1544
01:34:15,516 --> 01:34:17,450
When all was said and done...

1545
01:34:17,518 --> 01:34:21,113
I was nothing more
than a goddamn trendy-ass poser.

1546
01:34:32,833 --> 01:34:35,063
Efficiency and progress

1547
01:34:35,136 --> 01:34:37,536
Is ours once more

1548
01:34:37,605 --> 01:34:41,701
Now that we have the neutron bomb

1549
01:34:41,776 --> 01:34:44,609
It's nice and quick and clean

1550
01:34:44,679 --> 01:34:46,840
And gets things done

1551
01:34:50,284 --> 01:34:54,482
Away with excess enemy

1552
01:34:54,555 --> 01:34:58,548
But no less value to property

1553
01:34:58,626 --> 01:35:00,389
No sense in war

1554
01:35:00,461 --> 01:35:02,395
But perfect sense

1555
01:35:02,463 --> 01:35:04,397
At home

1556
01:35:09,970 --> 01:35:12,404
The sun beams down on a brand-new day

1557
01:35:12,473 --> 01:35:14,532
No more welfare tax to pay

1558
01:35:14,608 --> 01:35:17,873
Unsightly slums
gone up in flashing light

1559
01:35:19,180 --> 01:35:21,444
Jobless millions whisked away

1560
01:35:21,515 --> 01:35:23,710
At last we have more room to play

1561
01:35:23,784 --> 01:35:26,947
All systems go
to kill the poor tonight

1562
01:35:28,089 --> 01:35:30,819
Gonna kill, kill, kill, kill
Kill the poor

1563
01:35:34,161 --> 01:35:37,426
Kill the poor tonight

1564
01:35:41,902 --> 01:35:44,234
Behold the sparkle of champagne

1565
01:35:44,305 --> 01:35:46,535
The crime rate's gone
Feel free again

1566
01:35:46,607 --> 01:35:49,906
Oh, life's a dream with you
Miss Lily White

1567
01:35:51,011 --> 01:35:53,377
Jane Fonda on the screen today

1568
01:35:53,447 --> 01:35:55,711
Convinced the liberals it's okay

1569
01:35:55,783 --> 01:35:59,651
So let's get dressed
and dance away the night

1570
01:35:59,720 --> 01:36:02,621
While they kill, kill, kill, kill
Kill the poor

1571
01:36:06,060 --> 01:36:09,325
Kill the poor tonight

1572
01:36:09,396 --> 01:36:11,523
Kill, kill, kill, kill
Kill the poor

1573
01:36:14,869 --> 01:36:17,895
Kill the poor tonight

1574
01:36:39,994 --> 01:36:42,326
Behold the sparkle of champagne

1575
01:36:42,396 --> 01:36:44,626
The crime rate's gone
Feel free again

1576
01:36:44,698 --> 01:36:47,997
Oh, life's a dream with you
Miss Lily White

1577
01:36:49,103 --> 01:36:51,469
Jane Fonda on the screen today

1578
01:36:51,539 --> 01:36:53,803
Convinced the liberals it's okay

1579
01:36:53,874 --> 01:36:57,742
So let's get dressed
and dance away the night

1580
01:36:57,812 --> 01:37:00,372
While they kill, kill, kill, kill
Kill the poor

1581
01:37:03,784 --> 01:37:06,981
Kill the poor tonight

1582
01:37:07,054 --> 01:37:09,181
Kill, kill, kill, kill
Kill the poor

1583
01:37:12,526 --> 01:37:15,825
Kill the poor tonight

1584
01:37:15,896 --> 01:37:17,989
Kill, kill, kill, kill
Kill the poor

1585
01:37:21,402 --> 01:37:23,666
Kill the poor tonight
