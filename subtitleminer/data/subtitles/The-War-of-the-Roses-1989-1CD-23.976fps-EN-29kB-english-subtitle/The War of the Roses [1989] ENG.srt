1
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,800
Do you have some valid reasons
for wanting a divorce?

2
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,400
Excuse me.

3
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:35,100
My sinuses are very sensitive to irritants.

4
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,800
ln the past five months,

5
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:48,100
l think l've breathed freely,
with both sides working, maybe a week total.

6
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,800
l gotta cut this out. lt's gonna kill me.

7
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,900
l hadn't smoked for 13 years.

8
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,000
l kept the last cigarette from my last pack.

9
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,600
l said if l never smoke this one cigarette

10
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,100
l'll never smoke again, period.

11
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,100
13 years l kept that cigarette.

12
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,800
Here.

13
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,400
l had this little case made for it.

14
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,600
See?

15
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,000
13 years.

16
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,300
And then, one Thursday afternoon,

17
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,800
Barbara came to see me.

18
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,500
And when she left...

19
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,100
You know where l am
if you change your mind.

20
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,900
Barbara and Oliver Rose.

21
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:16,800
You'd have heard of 'em, except l kept
what happened out ofthe papers.

22
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:20,900
l think you should hear the story, though.
lt might matter to you.

23
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,700
l won't start the clock yet.

24
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,500
My fee is $450 an hour.

25
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,500
When a man who makes $450 an hour
wants to tell you something for free,

26
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,000
you should listen.

27
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,700
They met... Great.

28
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,800
They agreed on that.

29
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,700
But, the way l saw it,
the poor bastards never had a chance.

30
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,200
lt was the final day of
the season in Nantucket.

31
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:59,000
A nor'easter was blowing the last
of the tourists offthe island.

32
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:05,800
The next item up for bid is an exquisite
Japanese carving, circa 1700.

33
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:10,200
A rare relief of a Shinto goddess,
very richly detailed.

34
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,000
- The intricacies ofthe Orient...
- $10!

35
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,400
l have $10 from the premature young man
in the grey raincoat.

36
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,800
- Do l hear 15?
- 11.

37
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,300
$11. Ladies and gentlemen,
please, do l hear 15?

38
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,000
- 20.
- $20. l have $20, ladies and gentlemen.

39
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,400
Do l hear 25 for this
exceptionally exotic item?

40
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,900
- $30.
- 31.

41
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,300
$31. All right, l have $31, ladies and
gentlemen. ls this my final offer?

42
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,500
Ladies and gentlemen, 31, going once...

43
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:45,000
- $40.
- $40! 40. Do l hear 45?

44
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:50,000
- 50. Five-0.
- $50. l have $50. Do l hear 60?

45
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,500
$50, going once. Going twice.

46
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,000
Sold... to the pretty lady in the white sweater.

47
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,300
- Do you know how much it's worth?
- Doesn't matter. l'm not selling.

48
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,500
$250.

49
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,700
Well, l guess l have a good eye.

50
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,900
l gotta catch the last ferry.

51
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,400
Wait a minute. Let me carry that for you.
Here. Put this on.

52
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,700
- l love the rain.
- God, l love it, too.

53
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:28,100
l know what you're thinking. Harvard Law,
woo, woo, woo! But l got a scholarship.

54
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,600
l'm not rich or anything. l'm brilliant.

55
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,100
- What about you?
- l'm not rich or brilliant.

56
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:38,100
- Where are you going to school?
- Madison. l got a scholarship. Gymnastics.

57
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,300
l don't know, though.
My body's getting kinda big.

58
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,300
lt looks, uh...

59
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,200
Like a pendulum -
the longer it is, the slower you move.

60
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:50,200
My vaults and tumbling aren't what
they were. My strength moves are good.

61
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,800
Your strength moves?

62
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,200
l love Nantucket.

63
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,700
Oh! l'm gonna miss the ferry.

64
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,500
- Thanks for walking me. Bye.
- Wait! What's your name?

65
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,400
Barbara!

66
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,300
Barbara!

67
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,100
Wait a second! l've got a great idea!

68
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,600
l'm sorry! l'm sorry!

69
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:45,200
Never, never, never apologise
for being multiorgasmic.

70
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:49,100
l honestly didn't know l was.

71
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,400
Oh, bless you!

72
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,300
Bless you.

73
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,700
lf we end up together,

74
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,600
then this is the most romantic day
of my whole life.

75
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,200
And ifwe don't,

76
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,400
then l'm a complete slut.

77
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,700
This is the story
we're gonna tell our grandchildren.

78
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,100
lt's the return ofthe bald avenger.

79
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:25,000
OK, that's the sixth time.
Now turn it off, honey.

80
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,300
Merry Christmas, Bird.

81
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:40,100
- Honey, give me those papers.
- Say please.

82
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,400
- Please.
- No.

83
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:56,200
- Where are they?
- l don't got.

84
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,800
- Nice try.
- Thanks.

85
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:19,600
Hello! Mom's home!

86
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:23,200
Get over here, you squeezy! Squozy!

87
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,700
Ohh, up we go!

88
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,200
Come on, you.

89
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,400
Hi, honey.

90
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,000
Yeah, now you go in that chair. Got it?

91
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,200
Well, you're gonna go in this one, lady.

92
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,800
- l got you...
- ls that for me?

93
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,300
- There's green for you.
- Oh, thanks.

94
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,700
And it's red for you.

95
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,100
- lt's not a good idea to give them sweets.
- Oh, no. lt is.

96
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:54,300
l read that kids who are deprived
of sweets and candies all the time,

97
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,300
they get obsessed by it
and they turn out to be obese.

98
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,800
Kids who get it all the time,
it's no big deal - they turn out normal.

99
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,800
And... here.

100
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:06,700
Being a waitress on Christmas Eve's
very profitable.

101
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,200
- What do you think, guys?
- Ah! Nice!

102
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,400
OK.

103
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,400
l have to put it on the tree! Josh, look!

104
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
What do you think?

105
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:30,900
- Looks like tin foil.
- No, you're right. lt doesn't make it.

106
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,100
l'll learn.

107
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,400
- Let's go for a walk.
- l gotta finish this.

108
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:40,300
- Just a quick stroll. Come on.
- lt's freezing outside. lt's snowing.

109
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,100
Yes. And l'm still asking you to take a walk.

110
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,100
Why? Huh?

111
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,300
- Where are we going?
- Just to the corner.

112
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:51,800
Barbara, l have work to do.
l can't be walking around here in the snow.

113
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:58,900
OK, we're at the corner.
So what do you wanna do now? Walk back?

114
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:02,800
- No, l wanna go for a ride in your car.
- l don't have a car.

115
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,500
- You got me a Morgan?
- Yes!

116
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:15,200
l don't believe it! A Morgan! A Morgan!

117
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:20,000
- The cook's brother brought it from England.
- lt's got a little rust. l'll restore it.

118
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,800
- How much you pay?
- lt's a present. l used my money.

119
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,300
Your money is our money.
Can we afford this?

120
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:30,000
You are gonna be so successful, this may be
our last opportunity to worry about money.

121
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:34,300
Come on! Here. Get in.
lt's a right-hand drive.

122
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,100
- Well, are you happy?
- l'm more than happy. l'm way past happy.

123
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,300
l'm married.

124
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,900
Sounds like a fairy tale, doesn't it?

125
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,100
And it was.

126
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:12,000
My father used to say: ''There are four things
that tell the world who a man is.''

127
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:16,400
''His house, his car, his wife, and his shoes.''

128
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:21,800
Oliver didn't have the house yet,
but he was definitely moving up in the world.

129
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,300
He'd only been with the firm six months

130
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,700
when he decided to have the senior partners
over to his new apartment for dinner.

131
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,300
He had his eye on the future.

132
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,200
So did l.

133
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,600
Ah, what a night!

134
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,200
Elke, Elke. Wait a minute.

135
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:55,400
We're eating with elderly people now.
Keep that closed.

136
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,300
- Where you been? Come on!
- Oliver, this is Elke.

137
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,100
- Elke, this is Oliver.
- Hi.

138
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,000
Come on. Come on.

139
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:05,000
Here is to Oliver and Gavin

140
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:08,700
for ajob well done
on Kentuckyversus Brunswick Coal.

141
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,800
Hear, hear!

142
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,100
- Hell of a litigation.
- Thank you.

143
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,400
l couldn't have done it without you, Oliver.

144
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:18,000
This man has a face
juries can't help but believe.

145
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,700
Gavin told the state attorney general
that if he didn't settle,

146
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,400
next election he'd be running as a gelding.

147
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,700
Well, let's drink up.

148
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,000
Good night, Mom.

149
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,800
Good night, sweethearts.

150
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,400
- Mom?
- Yeah?

151
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,800
Can l take some more dessert to our room?

152
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,100
OK! Time for bed. Let's go.

153
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,700
- Guess not.
- Kiss... Kiss.

154
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,900
Kiss Daddy.

155
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,600
- Good night, sweetheart.
- Good night.

156
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,400
- Good night, buddy.
- Good night, Dad.

157
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,100
Sleep well.

158
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,400
l used to be chubby as a kid. Yeah.

159
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,900
Let's eat.

160
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,400
Oh, my!

161
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,800
Whatever flavour is this?

162
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,300
No, don't tell me. Let me think now. Uh...

163
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:27,000
- lt isn't apples.
- You make something with apples.

164
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,900
- No. Unless you mean baked apples?
- Prunes?

165
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,100
No. Wait a minute.
This is a very special taste...

166
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,300
- Raisins!
- lt isn't pears.

167
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:44,300
Um... fresh fig with, uh... a little cognac.

168
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:51,000
- Figs! l never would have thought offigs!
- l never would have guessed.

169
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,700
lt's fantastic, isn't it, Elke?

170
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,100
lt's absolutely spectacular.

171
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,500
- Mrs Marshall, more wine?
- Please.

172
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,600
- Your crystal is lovely.
- Thank you.

173
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:07,000
- lt's not Waterford.
- Baccarat.

174
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,700
Then we are paying our associates too much!

175
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,000
Actually, we got it quite reasonably.

176
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:20,300
lt's... lt's kind of an interesting story.

177
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,600
Why don't you tell it, Barb?

178
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,800
Well... we were in Paris...

179
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,200
lt was our fifth anniversary.

180
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:45,800
We'd had lunch in this wonderful place in
the market district, called the Pa-day Crishon.

181
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,500
- Pied de Cochon.
- Thanks.

182
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,300
We were wandering around
and we came upon the...

183
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,500
Rue de Paradis,

184
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,100
where the Baccarat
has its factory and museum.

185
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,900
l didn't know about this before l met Oliver.

186
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,900
My mother bought her glasses at the A&P.

187
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,500
You know, the kind with the raised flowers
that always chipped off after a few weeks.

188
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,200
They were always yellow, remember?

189
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:17,300
Anyway, here we were in this immense room
filled with all that Baccarat had ever made.

190
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:22,500
A field of crystal. lt was so... so pretty.

191
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,000
l mean, l felt...

192
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,500
whatever the word.

193
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,300
And suddenly, from the next room,
we heard the sound of glass breaking.

194
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:38,200
Well, l looked at Oliver and Oliver
looked at me, and then... Oh... No.

195
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:41,300
Before that,
there was this big, black limousine.

196
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,400
Now, this is important.
Well, before the limousine...

197
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:48,700
To make a long story short, a couple
had ordered a design for their anniversary.

198
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,300
When it was ready,
they were getting a divorce.

199
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,400
The woman had smashed her half,

200
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,100
and l convinced the man to sell us
his half cheap -just to spite her.

201
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,700
And, uh... that's our Baccarat story.

202
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,800
Well, l think everybody
had a great time, don't you?

203
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:25,100
- To make a long story short, no.
- l'm sorry. You were just rambling on...

204
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,300
Tell your own story next time you care
so desperately what everybody thinks.

205
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,500
Fuckface!

206
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,400
- They're my bosses.
- They're Gavin's bosses, too.

207
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,200
lt didn't stop him from getting
a footjob at dinner.

208
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:43,400
Gavin doesn't care about making partner.
He doesn't have a wife and kids. l do.

209
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,200
You wanna keep living in this apartment?

210
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:52,000
Because you do not buy a house
on an associate's salary.

211
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:55,100
At least, not the kind of house that we want.

212
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,000
OK, l care what they think.
l care, all right? l care.

213
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,200
Shoot me.

214
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,700
And that phoney laugh.

215
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,900
That was a genuine laugh.

216
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,600
All right, all right! Maybe l overdid it.

217
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:16,600
l was just trying to keep things going.

218
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,800
God, l hope they didn't notice
what ajerk l am.

219
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,600
They never seem to.

220
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,000
''Dear Homeowner,

221
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,600
l love your house!''

222
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:50,900
''lf you ever consider selling,
please... contact me.''

223
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,800
''Barbara Rose.''

224
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:56,600
Mom! l'm gonna be late for practice!

225
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,700
You've been doing this for a year
and nobody's called.

226
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,300
This is a great house. l love this house.

227
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,500
lt's a waste oftime.

228
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,400
l bet l get this house. Five bucks.

229
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,500
Five bucks.

230
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:25,000
- Hello.
- Oh! l was just leaving a note.

231
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,800
How kind. Please, won't you come in?

232
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,900
All right.

233
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,600
l don't believe we've met.

234
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,000
- Barbara Rose.
- l'm Maureen.

235
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:47,700
l don't remember Mother mentioning you,
but she had so many friends.

236
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:52,700
Oh! Oh, l'm very sorry.

237
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:55,400
Thank you. She went peacefully.

238
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,900
What am l going to do with this old place?

239
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,800
l just can't bear to put it up for sale and have
a bunch of strangers tromping through it.

240
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:08,300
lf l could just find someone
who would love it as much as Mom did.

241
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,600
That's more important to me
than whatever money we get for it.

242
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:15,100
lf you know anybody
who might be interested...

243
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:21,800
- Can we go up and pick our rooms?
- We can do whatever we want. lt's our house.

244
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,800
Who gets first pick? As if l had to ask.

245
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:29,200
Don't get scared. We'll do it together.

246
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,500
l just feel kind of strange.

247
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,200
l mean, this house is so beautiful

248
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,400
and we live here.

249
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,500
This is who we are? This is me?

250
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,000
- l'll be home early.
- Where are you going?

251
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:50,900
To work. l wish l didn't have to,
but somebody's got to pay for all this.

252
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,400
- lt's Saturday.
- Come on, this is a great day.

253
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,200
You got the fun part!

254
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,300
Kitchen first.

255
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,300
Everything was working for the Roses.

256
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,200
Let me restate that.

257
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,400
The Roses were working for everything.

258
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:25,800
Over the next six years, Oliver dug in.
Made senior partner.

259
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,700
The kids lopped off 70, 80 pounds.

260
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,500
And Barbara laboured seven days a week

261
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:35,700
to create the perfect home
that Oliver always dreamed of.

262
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:39,100
Not easy for a girl who grew up
drinking her milk

263
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,300
from glasses with chipped, yellow flowers.

264
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,900
There were a million choices...
and she sweated every one of 'em.

265
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,300
She refiinishedall the tables herself.

266
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,100
lt took sixmonths
to get the floors exactly right.

267
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:59,000
A hundred Sundays to fiind the perfect
Staffordshire fiigures andplates

268
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,800
that she put over the fiireplace.

269
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,400
When you work thathard on something,

270
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:09,000
eventually you have to fiinish
and face the awful question:

271
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,200
''What's left to do?''

272
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,300
- Are you working?
- Yes. ls it important?

273
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,400
Yes. Kind of. l hope so.

274
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:27,100
Stephanie Mayes called to say
thank you for dinner the other night.

275
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,000
She said the pâté l made was so good
l should go into business.

276
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:34,100
So l asked her if she really meant it
and she said she did,

277
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,000
so l took a pound over to her
and collected $35.

278
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,300
l'd almost forgotten
what it felt like to make money.

279
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,800
- You sold liver to our friends?
- She paid me in cash, Oliver.

280
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:51,000
Somehow that felt different from
the money l get cashing a cheque.

281
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:55,300
lt made me feel like...
trading in the Volvo on one ofthose...

282
00:24:55,400 --> 00:25:01,000
four-wheel drive things with the big,
knobby tyres and the 200-horsepower engine.

283
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,800
So l did. l'm gonna pick it up tomorrow.

284
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,300
Thank you so much for telling me.

285
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:14,500
And you think that you... need this?
l mean, the Volvo was a fine car.

286
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:18,700
- l'll pay for it with my own money.
- How much does it cost?

287
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:22,900
All right, l know it was kind of crazy
but l just... wanted it, OK?

288
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,300
25,000.

289
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:31,700
So you only have to sell
700 more pounds of pâté.

290
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,300
Maybe l will. Maybe l'm starting a business.

291
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:41,900
- But ifyou don't want me to, uh...
- No. No, no, no, no. You do it.

292
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Do it. Do it.

293
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,400
l'm doing it.

294
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,200
Wait a minute. Wait one minute.
l do not understand. What's the, uh...

295
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,600
what's the attitude?

296
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,800
l told you l would handle it.

297
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:12,800
Yeah, and l didn't see anything happening
so l went to Ed and l set up the interview.

298
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:17,100
- l would have done it.
- Yeah, but sometimes you need a little push.

299
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,500
We all need a little push.

300
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,500
We agreed that,
if you're doing this liver bit,

301
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,700
we would need someone
to take care ofthe house, right?

302
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,900
Right, Oliver. Right again.

303
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,600
Oh, come on. Let's not argue, OK?
Just think about it for a minute!

304
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,300
lf you don't want to interview the lady,
l will send her home.

305
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,600
l'm only trying to make your life easier.

306
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:57,000
Somehow the thought of a stranger living
in my house just seems weird, you know?

307
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:00,500
Doesn't it? l don't mean just for us,
but for you, too.

308
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:04,200
- Oh, but then l guess you do this all the time.
- No, no.

309
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:09,000
l try this as a means offinding
room and board and a little money.

310
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,800
l'm also attending a few classes
at William and Mary College.

311
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,700
But that won't interfere with my duties.

312
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,300
That's great. l'm happy for you - really.

313
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:24,800
- So, do l get the job?
- The fact is, Susan, l don't need a live-in.

314
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,300
This was my husband's suggestion.

315
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:32,200
l have raised two kids on my own
and now they're about to go offto college.

316
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:35,900
- They were both accepted at Harvard.
- That's a nice school, too.

317
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,600
Thanks.

318
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:40,400
So, anyway, it'll just be
Oliver and me here at home.

319
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,500
Although l am getting going
my own catering business.

320
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,400
But let's face it,
l don't need to work for the money.

321
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:50,900
And that does not make me one ofthese
women who is married to a successful man

322
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,200
and has dedicated her life
to him and her children,

323
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:59,400
and then has to validate herself as a human
being, because her children are leaving her,

324
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,000
by studying photography
or opening an art gallery

325
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:06,100
or going into interior design
in her husband's office. No!

326
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:10,900
l have a wonderful house,
crammed with beautiful things.

327
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,600
l did this house myself. l did a greatjob.

328
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,700
Not that l am necessarily
a slave to materialism. No.

329
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:22,600
But l am proud ofwhat l have accomplished,

330
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:27,900
although l suppose some people find my life
disgusting. Disgusting is too strong a word.

331
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,400
No, l would not say that many people
would respectthe choices l have made,

332
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:36,600
although women would. Women like me.

333
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:41,700
But then l don't care what they think
because l can't stand who they are.

334
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:45,700
What l'm trying to say, Susan,
is that l don't need a live-in.

335
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:54,400
Well... thanks for the interview
and good luck, and God bless you.

336
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,500
l would like you to understand

337
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,100
that, if l were to hire you,
my life would probably change.

338
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:03,600
You would be this new element in the house.

339
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,000
Well...

340
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,900
Let me show you where your room is.

341
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Hey, Bennie. Dumb dog.

342
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,000
Hey, Bennie!

343
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,600
Let's see if he'll go for it again.

344
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,700
Bennie...

345
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,500
Yeah, dumb.

346
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,900
Oh, the Bennie boy.
The Bennie-Bennie-Bennie boy. Yes.

347
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
He's the best boy. He's the best boy!
We love our good boy.

348
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,200
He's a good boy! We love our Bennie boy.

349
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,700
Yes, a pretty dog! He's a pretty dog!

350
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,900
Rose residence.

351
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,600
- Susan, is that for me?
- lt's for Josh.

352
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:44,400
- Are you expecting a call?
- Jason Larrabee said he'd confirm lunch.

353
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:47,200
l'm trying to land him as a client.

354
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:50,900
The word around town is he's up
for a Cabinet post. l wish he'd call.

355
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,700
He will.

356
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:58,700
Did you get a chance
to look over that contract for me?

357
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:02,600
- What contract?
- On the consulate luncheon l'm doing.

358
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:06,800
- Oh, yeah. No, but l'll read it this weekend.
- OK.

359
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,400
No. No, not OK.

360
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:13,900
l have to sign it tomorrow. l gave it
to you last week, but it's probably fine.

361
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:17,000
- l'll read it now.
- Oh, no, don't bother.

362
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,400
No. Get it.

363
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,000
Sure.

364
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:38,600
What?! What is it?

365
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,800
lt's a fly. Where'd it go?

366
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,100
On the fridge.

367
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,300
Stay upwind of him.

368
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,900
How about that?

369
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,700
Not bad, huh?

370
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,300
l admire your technique.

371
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,400
Hello.

372
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:10,100
Mr Larrabee, hi. How are you?
No! No, no, it's not too late.

373
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,500
Could you hang on just one second
while l use the other phone?

374
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,900
Thank you.

375
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,700
Yes, sir. l'm looking forward to that, too.

376
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,700
No, no, no. Course you're not bothering me.

377
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,500
Lawyers, we neversleep.

378
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,500
l'm available to you, sir, 24 hours a...

379
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:56,000
Who left the appliances on in the kitchen?
lt sounds like who knows what!

380
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,200
l must have hit some switches when l was
cleaning up. You know how that can happen.

381
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:03,500
l got great news.

382
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,700
Lunch is on tomorrow with Larrabee.

383
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:10,400
l'm gonna meet him
at his club in Philadelphia.

384
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,500
He's mine!

385
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,700
Look how crazy you are
about yourself right now.

386
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,600
- l'm sorry.
- Don't apologise.

387
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:24,200
l live with the assumption that all guys
owe an apology to the woman they live with.

388
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,100
You're so full of shit.

389
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:31,500
So, where's that little contract ofyours?

390
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,700
Maybe l can up your price, huh?

391
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,900
Where is it?

392
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,200
- You sure it's all right?
- My fee's going up.

393
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,700
Better get me while you can afford me.

394
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,800
- l don't want you to read it.
- Let me have it.

395
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,700
l got you and l'm not gonna let you get away!

396
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:04,000
Let me go.

397
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,600
Let me go! Let go!

398
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,800
Let go of it! Let go!

399
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,500
Ah, Jesus!

400
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,300
You think you're pretty strong,
don't you?

401
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:43,700
What the hell is wrong with you?

402
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:52,600
lf you're with a woman for any length oftime,
eventually you'll ask her that question.

403
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,200
lf she doesn't answer, that's trouble.

404
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:59,900
And when trouble begins, it comes at you
from directions you'd never expect.

405
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,700
Oliver was a sitting duck.

406
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,900
l think you're gonna be
very well served by our firm,

407
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,300
especially ifthe rumours are true.

408
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:11,700
Well, there may be a Senate
confirmation hearing in my future.

409
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:15,700
- We could definitely be of help with that.
- Yes. Waiter... Ohh!

410
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:19,100
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. l'm fine.

411
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,500
- Could l have some more coffee, please?
- Certainly, sir.

412
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,200
Regarding your Senate confirmation,

413
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:29,500
it may not be a bad idea for us
to have your personal asset liability...

414
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:33,300
Oliver?

415
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:36,100
Do you think you're having a heart attack?

416
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:43,200
- Call an ambulance!
- Wipe that stuff off his chin.

417
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,800
- Hang in there, Oliver.
- Call my wife.

418
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,200
You're doing just fine.

419
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:59,200
- Somebody called for the defibrillator.
- Right here.

420
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,500
How's it goin'?

421
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,300
You may be the only person
l'm doing better than.

422
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:12,800
The wife stabbed me in the stomach.

423
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,900
With a nail file this time.

424
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:19,300
She's training to be a manicurist.

425
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:24,500
- They make good money, you know?
- l'm trying to get a doctor for you, babe.

426
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,700
They always feel bad after.

427
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,400
Mr Rose? l'm Dr Gordon.
This is my associate.

428
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:33,100
- Dr Hillerman. Jason Larrabee called us.
- How are his vital signs?

429
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,200
- We were here first.
- We'll be with you in just a moment.

430
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:40,200
Babes, take it easy.
Can't you see the guy's dying over here?

431
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,400
- Did someone call my wife?
- Yes.

432
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:46,300
l need to write her a note...
in case she doesn't get here in time.

433
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,500
- Let's get him to ClCU.
- Jeff, let's go.

434
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,200
l'll get the pen back once we get there.

435
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,700
- ls my wife here?
- l don't think so.

436
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,600
Get me some pictures. Upper Gl.

437
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:07,500
You're gonna have to swallow some barium.
But you'll like it. lt's peppermint flavoured.

438
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:12,500
Nothing is more important
than the hors d'oeuvres.

439
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,100
That's where people
make their firstjudgment.

440
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:19,500
Perdóname, senora. La senora Rose
ha recibido una llamada urgente.

441
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,500
There's an urgent phone call for you.

442
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,400
Hello?

443
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,300
Oh, God!

444
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:30,300
Oh, my God! All right. l'm leaving right now.

445
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,500
- My husband's had a heart attack.
- That happened to my mother.

446
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:39,500
Don't worry. Your luncheon's gonna
be terrific. Everything's gonna be great.

447
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:44,600
The x-rays showed an oesophageal tear.
lt's commonly known as a hiatal hernia.

448
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,600
Right there.

449
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:49,100
The pain symptoms are identical to angina.

450
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,600
Stress, coffee, spicy foods, gas.

451
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:57,700
Your nerve endings get irritated. You know
what that's like. Not pleasant, but not fatal.

452
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,100
Could you get this hiatal hernia, say,

453
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:03,800
by being squeezed
between someone's legs?

454
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,300
No.

455
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:10,900
- So l'm not going to die?
- Eventually, but not today.

456
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,800
Thank you.

457
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:21,300
- You can wait right here.
- Thank you.

458
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,800
Oliver! You're alive!

459
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:33,900
Yeah, it was something else.
lt wasn't the heart, it was a rip. A tear.

460
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,100
You're alive!

461
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,900
- So what are you gonna do?
- Wait for Barbara to pick me up.

462
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,300
- l'll wait with you.
- Good.

463
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:50,000
Think we can get that nurse to come
back here with a bottle of musk oil?

464
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:56,600
- She should be here any minute.
- Yeah.

465
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,000
lt's stuffy in these places.

466
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:20,100
- l got us enough booze for the whole trip.
- Thanks.

467
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:24,600
l couldn't remember whether you wanted
a twist, so l got you some just in case.

468
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,800
Thank you, Gavin.

469
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,600
- Salud.
- Salud.

470
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,500
All those lives going on out there...

471
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:51,600
People we'll never meet...
experiencing things we'll never know.

472
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,500
We can't know.

473
00:39:55,600 --> 00:40:01,700
ln your own life, by this point,
you think you know what's gonna be but...

474
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:05,400
- But you don't know.
- You don't know.

475
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,300
lt's always just when you think
you got it figured out

476
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:14,600
when, bingo, something comes along
and knocks you right on your ass.

477
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:19,100
Why do you think Barbara
didn't come to the hospital?

478
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:24,300
l don't know.
She probably had a good reason.

479
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,900
Hiya, Bennie. Come here, sweetheart.

480
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:59,100
Where is everybody, huh?

481
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:03,900
l guess you're the only one who
gives a damn about me in this family.

482
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:26,900
Oliver!

483
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,500
You don't know how happy l am to see you!

484
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,800
- You didn't come to the hospital.
- No.

485
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:38,600
No. Well, l called and...

486
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:42,100
well, everything seemed to be...
under control.

487
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,800
l just... l didn't want to disturb you.

488
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:49,100
Disturb me?
Well, l wasn't doing much. Just dying.

489
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,500
Oliver! You weren't dying.

490
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,500
- You didn't even call.
- Of course l did. l talked to someone.

491
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:58,400
- Not to me.
- Well, l talked to a nurse and...

492
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,800
she said that you weren't dying.

493
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:03,500
Well, l thought l was dying!

494
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:10,600
l wrote you a note...
in case you didn't get there in time.

495
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:17,200
l can't read your handwriting.

496
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:23,300
l was on a gurney being rushed
to lntensive Care in excruciating pain.

497
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:26,700
lt says:

498
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:33,000
''My love, by the time you
receive this, l may be gone.''

499
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,700
''My life was... fun...

500
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,800
..full... beyond my dreams.''

501
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:46,400
''All l have... and all l am, l owe to you.''

502
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,300
''You gave me courage
to surpass what l know l am,

503
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,500
the strength to...''

504
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,700
Oh, this is where l had a spasm.

505
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,700
l can't read it, but the next line says:

506
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:05,900
''l lie here, feeling my life ebb away.''

507
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,600
''l cling to your image.''

508
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:12,300
''l will take you with me to eternity.''

509
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:16,200
''l cherish you.''

510
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,300
''l thank merciful God for you.''

511
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:26,700
l didn't have the strength to sign it.

512
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:33,800
l'm... l'm sure they, um...

513
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:37,600
they would've told me who it was from.

514
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:46,400
l can't believe
you didn't call us at school, Mother.

515
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:51,300
l didn't see any point in alarming you until
there was something to be alarmed about.

516
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,700
Your mother didn't want
to disturb anybody today.

517
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,800
Yeah, well, you still should have called.

518
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:04,200
You should have.

519
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:07,400
l'm sure your mother didn't want
to worry you needlessly.

520
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:10,400
The important thing is your father is alive.

521
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:21,200
We've always been a family
that communicated.

522
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:25,600
lf anything important happens,
everyone should know about it.

523
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:29,200
That's the rule.

524
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:22,200
- What's going on?
- l'm very upset.

525
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:30,600
lt's 3 o'clock in the morning.
Turn the television off.

526
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:37,800
l wasn't sure why l didn't go to the hospital,
but now l think l know.

527
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:40,600
l'd just like to put today behind us, OK?

528
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:42,800
OK.

529
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:49,300
l was gonna drive to the hospital,
but l knew you were OK.

530
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:56,500
Cos l never think that anything really terrible
could happen to me or the kids or you.

531
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:00,800
And l was getting on the expressway,

532
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:04,800
and suddenly l had this very strong
feeling that you were dead.

533
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:10,200
And l knew what it would feel like
to be alone in this house,

534
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:12,400
to not have you in my life.

535
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:16,700
And l got so scared, l had to pull over.

536
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:23,900
Well, you don't have to be scared any more.

537
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,600
l got scared because l felt happy.

538
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,800
You were happy because l was dead?

539
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:53,600
l was happy to be free.

540
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:56,400
Like a weight had been lifted.

541
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:00,400
- Like a weight had been lifted?
- Yeah.

542
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,800
So, how am l supposed to respond?
You tell me you wished l was dead?!

543
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:11,500
l thought it was important.

544
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:42,800
l think you owe me an apology, Barbara.

545
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:46,100
lf you have something to say,
l'd like to hear it.

546
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:54,000
l want a divorce.

547
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:00,200
No, you don't.

548
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:02,600
You can't have one!

549
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:06,500
l've thought about this a lot.

550
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:09,100
l really don't want to be
married to you any more.

551
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,600
Why do you want a divorce?

552
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:23,800
Did... did l do something?
Did l... did l notdo something?

553
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:28,100
l can't give you specifics, Oliver.

554
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:32,300
- Well, try!
- l don't want to try!

555
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:40,800
ls there somebody else? Another man?

556
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:42,500
No.

557
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:45,500
- A woman?
- You wish.

558
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,600
l should be the one asking for a divorce!

559
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:51,400
l was rushed to hospital
suffering from severe...

560
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:53,700
lndigestion.

561
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:58,000
Oh, you're such an expert
at making me look like ajerk.

562
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:01,400
OK, OK, OK. l'm sorry.

563
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:04,700
l'm the bad person.
Let's just blame me for this.

564
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:08,000
No! No. l think l need...

565
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:10,200
l think you owe me,

566
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:14,600
after this many pretty goddamn good
years of marriage, a solid reason.

567
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:19,100
l worked my ass offto make enough money
to provide you with a good life,

568
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:22,100
and you owe me a reason that makes sense.

569
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,700
So let's hear it.
Come on. Let's hear it. Let's hear it!

570
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:30,200
Because...

571
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:32,900
when l watch you eat,

572
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,700
when l see you asleep,

573
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:38,400
when l look at you lately,

574
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,700
l just wanna smash your face in.

575
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:49,100
Come on, smash my face.
Come on. You wanna smash my face?

576
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:10,700
The next time... l hit back.

577
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:17,300
And you'd better get yourself
a damn good lawyer.

578
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,800
The best your money can buy.

579
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:47,400
- What does she want?
- Child support.

580
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:49,400
l've always taken care of my kids.

581
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:53,800
And they will be 18 in one year,
which makes it nice for you.

582
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:59,700
- What about alimony?
- Barbara, against my advice, waives alimony.

583
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:04,100
l'm making money with my business.
l get a lot of referrals. l can support myself.

584
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:06,700
Well, l'm a lucky guy.

585
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,700
My client is being more than fair, Mr Rose.

586
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:14,600
She's waived alimony and she's willing to
waive her rights against your law practice

587
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:20,100
in exchange for the house and all of
its contents, except your shaving gear and...

588
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,300
his clothing?

589
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:27,800
- Everything l made went into that house.
- l found that house.

590
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:31,600
Every piece offurniture is where it is
because l put it there. lt is my house.

591
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:34,800
lf your client has finished yammering,
explain to her

592
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:39,000
that a wife does not
automatically get the house.

593
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:44,600
l thought you told her that
she was entitled to anything and everything.

594
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:47,300
- l told her what?
- Yes...

595
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,400
Here it is.

596
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,900
l quote: ''My love,

597
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:56,000
by the time you...''

598
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:58,200
Boy, what a handwriting.

599
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:02,700
''By the time you receive this, l may be gone.''

600
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:11,500
''All l am and all l have, l owe to you.''

601
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:15,800
You wrote this, Mr Rose?

602
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:24,500
Excuse me, Mr Thurmont, you tiny,
little, worm-like, infinitesimal prick,

603
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:28,300
could l have a word with my wife, please?

604
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,200
Certainly.

605
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:39,000
lf this is a who-can-sink-lowest-fastest
contest, you won.

606
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:42,300
By showing him my letter,

607
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:47,000
you have sunk below the deepest layer
of prehistoric frog shit

608
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:49,800
at the bottom of a New Jersey scum swamp.

609
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,100
l may have let you have the house,
but now...

610
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:58,400
you'll never get it.

611
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:01,500
You will never get that house.

612
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:04,700
Do you understand?

613
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:09,100
You will never get that house.

614
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:16,700
- We'll see.
- Yeah... we'll see.

615
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:29,400
Maybe l shouldn't have
let you see that letter.

616
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:32,100
Dear girl, by the time this is all over,

617
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:35,500
you'll think oftoday
as one ofyour lighter moments.

618
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:44,800
What do you call 500 lawyers
at the bottom ofthe ocean?

619
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:47,300
An excellent start.

620
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:51,900
l used to resentjokes like that.

621
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:56,400
Now l see them as simple truths.

622
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:01,200
Lawyers...

623
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:06,700
Hello.

624
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:09,800
Honey, l can't talk right now.
l'm with a client.

625
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:12,900
Love you, miss you, want you... Bye!

626
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,600
l recently married.

627
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:26,800
Which is the last thing l ever thought
l'd do after what happened to the Roses.

628
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:32,000
When it comes to women...
l hope l'm a better man now than l was.

629
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:37,800
l know l'm a better lawyer,
when it comes to divorce.

630
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:43,200
l'll never make another mistake
like l made with Oliver.

631
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:47,900
Let's just concentrate on the job at hand.

632
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,200
She wants the house. You want the house.

633
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:54,500
- l'm the one who's living in a hotel room!
- Not for long.

634
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:57,700
- She claims she found the house.
- She did find it, right?

635
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:02,300
Yeah, but that's not the point. She says
she made it what it is. She didn't. She didn't.

636
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:07,300
l'm not keeping score but, if l were,
it'd be about 83 to 6 in my favour.

637
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:09,800
Of all the really... good stuff.

638
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:12,900
Those wonderful Staffordshire dogs...

639
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:17,700
ln fact, most ofthe Staffordshires, l found.
And that Art-Deco rug and, uh...

640
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:22,100
And that stove in the kitchen? She wouldn't
have bought it if l hadn't pushed her!

641
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,900
Shoes. That's what she's good at buying.

642
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:28,700
l gotta have shelves in the closet
or she'd have them all over the place!

643
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:32,000
Here we go. You're gonna love this.

644
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:35,500
Civil Code, Title 16-9-0-4, Section C.

645
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:40,800
l used this once for a freebie divorce
l did for my cousin Paulie. Total loser.

646
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:42,500
Read.

647
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:45,900
''For the purposes of subsections
one and two of paragraphs...''

648
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,800
Here. Skip down to...
''Parties who have pursued separate lives...''

649
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:53,700
''Parties who have pursued separate
lives sharing neither bed nor board

650
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:55,900
shall be deemed to have lived apart

651
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,500
even though they reside
under the same roof...''

652
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:04,200
Even though they reside
under the same roof?

653
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:07,200
Yeah. The law was put on the books
for poor people:

654
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:11,100
folks who couldn't afford
separate residences. But we can use it.

655
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:14,700
- So l can move back in.
- lfyour divorce is settled in court,

656
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:19,500
it shows you're committed to the property.
Plus, you can see she doesn't sell the assets.

657
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:22,000
l can work on her,
get her to fold on the house.

658
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,900
No. No, Oliver, you don't even
deal with her. You avoid her.

659
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,100
Women can be a lot meaner than we think.

660
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:31,300
Never underestimate her as an adversary.
Don't talk to her.

661
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:34,500
No, no, no, l won't. Don't worry about me.

662
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:36,500
Gavin...

663
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:38,500
- Thank you.
- All right.

664
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:43,300
All right, go on. Go home.

665
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:47,600
- This is the stupidest thing you've ever done!
- Second stupidest.

666
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:50,500
- You can't stay here!
- The law says l can.

667
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:54,400
Title 16-9-0-4, Section C.

668
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:58,300
Look it up, tootsie pie.

669
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:14,300
OK, Mom, you're on.

670
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,700
Let me see that bag.

671
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,200
ls that what you're gonna put on top?

672
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:33,200
- Yes, it is.
- Fine.

673
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:35,800
Josh, plug it in, please.

674
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:55,900
- lt's a short.
- lt's not a short.

675
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,100
One ofthe ornaments
is touching the sockets.

676
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:05,400
Fine.

677
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:08,400
You take care of it, Oliver.

678
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:15,600
Come on, it's Christmas time.
Let's get festive.

679
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:19,600
- l have to go out.
- l got stuff l gotta do in my room.

680
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:45,900
- Oh, God, my house is on fire!
- Mine too, babe!

681
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,300
Really, you idiot!

682
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:53,100
Wait up, babe!

683
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:55,800
Oh, my God!

684
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:57,900
Omar, do something!

685
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
- Fire!
- Mom!

686
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:02,600
Fire! Fire!

687
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:05,600
Call the police! l'll get the extinguisher!

688
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:08,900
991. 999. 911.

689
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:12,300
- Stay out ofthe way!
- Coming through!

690
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:16,600
''One: store in a cool place.
Two: hold upright, pull pin out.'' OK.

691
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:20,300
- ''Three: stand back, aim away from face.''
- Do it!

692
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:23,500
- Dad, hurry!
- All right! OK, OK! All right. OK, OK.

693
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,500
Dad! The curtain!

694
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:50,700
lt's over. Thank God l was here!

695
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:54,000
The whole house could have gone up.

696
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:58,600
OK, OK. l'll get a sponge
and start cleaning up.

697
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:02,400
Maybe a rake... or a bulldozer.

698
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:25,600
lt might not have been the lights.

699
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:29,100
You always know.

700
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:52,800
Rather than argue about who supposedly
did what, l'd like to reach some accord.

701
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:56,000
- Time is passing.
- l'd love to be done with this, too.

702
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,900
Right. lfwe leave settlement to the court,
the lawyers get everything!

703
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,300
So l've come up with a fair solution.

704
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,500
- You wanna hear it?
- Yes.

705
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:09,200
Now, l understand your point of view.
You've invested 18 years in this marriage.

706
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:13,900
That's worth a lot.
A tremendous amount. $163,800.

707
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,000
- How did you arrive at that number?
- Fairly.

708
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:22,900
- You do almost the same things as Susan.
- No! She's in college. She should make more.

709
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,500
Barbara!

710
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:28,500
There is no comparison whatsoever
between what she does and...

711
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:32,000
Her salary is a base, so l doubled it.

712
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:34,800
And that wasn't enough,
and then l tripled it,

713
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:37,800
and that's how l came up with this figure.

714
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:41,700
$490,633, approximately.

715
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:44,400
l shall give you that in cash. lt won't be easy.

716
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:47,000
lt'll be harder than hell,
but l'm gonna do it.

717
01:01:47,100 --> 01:01:50,700
You just have to, you know,
agree to give up the house.

718
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:55,000
You owe me. You've gotten more out of
knowing me than l've got out of knowing you.

719
01:01:55,100 --> 01:02:00,400
l'm not even gonna ask you what that means.
l found this house! l bought everything in it!

720
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:04,300
With my money! lt's a lot easier to spend it
than it is to make it, honeybun!

721
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:07,400
You might not have made it
if not for me, sweet cakes!

722
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:10,100
You weren't even multiorgasmic
before you met me!

723
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:13,900
You expect me to keep
reassuring you sexually,

724
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,700
even now when we disgust each other?!

725
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:29,800
Don't let this bother you.
lt's all gonna work out.

726
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:37,100
The red areas are hers.

727
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:39,800
The yellow areas are mine.

728
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:41,900
Green is neutral.

729
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:47,000
The kitchen was difficult, but Barbara
came up with the idea oftime allotment.

730
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:51,400
This seems rational to you both?

731
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:54,200
Yeah.

732
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:57,600
Oliver, my father used to say

733
01:02:57,700 --> 01:03:01,500
that a man could never outdo a woman
when it came to love or revenge.

734
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:06,000
Why don't you let her have the house?
There are other houses. And other women.

735
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:10,500
No, no, no. l'm going to win because
l've got her to accept the ground rules.

736
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:15,700
Oliver, there is no winning in this.
lt's only degrees of losing.

737
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:20,300
l got more square footage.

738
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:50,300
Sorry to disturb you, but l was wondering
if l could borrow a sleeping tablet.

739
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:55,300
- Did Oliver send you for it?
- No. Actually, no.

740
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:00,300
All right, you got me there.

741
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:03,800
Which is good, because l'm
uncomfortable with the charade.

742
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:08,500
lt's nice to see somebody still
caring for somebody in this house.

743
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:12,700
- Good night, Susan.
- So, there will be no pills?

744
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:16,600
Oh, kitty. Kitty, wait.

745
01:04:16,700 --> 01:04:18,800
Kitty, kitty...

746
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:39,500
Do you want me to call around
to find an open drugstore?

747
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:41,700
l'll find one.

748
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:45,700
- Should l come?
- lt's up to you.

749
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:49,600
- These are my favourite kind of cars.
- lt's a Morgan.

750
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:51,800
Of course.

751
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:07,900
lt's cosy.

752
01:05:26,700 --> 01:05:29,100
- What was that?
- A bump of some sort.

753
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:36,000
Oh, Kitty! Oh, mein Gott.

754
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:46,100
Look, why don't you go into the house
and find a large Ziploc bag?

755
01:05:46,100 --> 01:05:49,000
- Ziploc?
- Yeah.

756
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:52,300
Oh, kitty. Kitty, kitty, kitty.

757
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:55,000
So much for the nine lives myth.

758
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:12,000
Here, kitty. Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

759
01:06:13,100 --> 01:06:14,900
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty!

760
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,500
Here, puss, puss, puss!

761
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,100
Here, puss, puss, puss!

762
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:24,800
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

763
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:28,100
Have you see my cat?

764
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:31,000
Are you talking to me?

765
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:43,200
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty. Come on, kitty.

766
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:45,600
Here, puss, puss, puss, puss.

767
01:06:45,700 --> 01:06:48,400
Where are you, kitty? Come on!

768
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:50,700
Here, kitty, kitty!

769
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:52,800
Come on, kitty, kitty. Come on.

770
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:55,000
Here, puss, puss, puss.

771
01:06:55,100 --> 01:06:59,100
Here, kitty. Here, kitty, kitty, kitty...

772
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:19,100
- What did you do with my cat?
- You're letting the heat out.

773
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:25,900
l know something happened. lnstead
of playing this game, what happened?

774
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,400
- You killed your cat, Barbara.
- What?

775
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:35,600
Yes. One damn Dalmane and
your kitty would be alive.

776
01:07:35,700 --> 01:07:41,200
l had to get up in the middle ofthe night,
looking for Sominex, and l backed out the...

777
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:05,200
That supposed to scare me?

778
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:12,200
lf you're looking for trouble,
Barbara, you found it!

779
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:55,200
What do you expect?
You killed my cat! You're making me nuts!

780
01:08:55,300 --> 01:08:57,700
Will you please...? l'm asking you to leave!

781
01:08:58,900 --> 01:09:01,400
No, it's my house,

782
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:04,400
and l'm going to stay.

783
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:28,600
Frankly, l'm concerned about
you, Oliver. You look haggard.

784
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:33,000
l feel great.

785
01:09:33,100 --> 01:09:36,500
l'll take time off after the Larrabee
confirmation hearings.

786
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:39,000
Why don't you take time before?

787
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:43,500
lt's vital to the firm this comes off
without a hitch. l want you at your best.

788
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:48,500
l'm at my best. l won't let you down.

789
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:51,200
l'm in fantastic shape.

790
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,200
l thank you so much for caring.

791
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:30,500
- Mr D'Amato. There's someone in your office.
- Who?

792
01:10:31,900 --> 01:10:34,800
- Use words, Mary Ann.
- Mrs Rose.

793
01:10:34,900 --> 01:10:39,200
l didn't think l should leave her in reception.
What with all the... you know.

794
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:42,200
Yeah, l know... Yeah, l know!

795
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:47,800
Barbara.

796
01:10:49,100 --> 01:10:53,600
You really shouldn't be here because
it might be viewed by some as unethical.

797
01:10:53,700 --> 01:10:57,600
Well, l am here... ethical or not.

798
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:03,500
You don't mind if l tape this

799
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:07,500
just so no one gets confused
about what was said?

800
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:13,100
What's on your mind?

801
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:18,800
Well, since you're the one who
advised Oliver to move back in,

802
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:21,500
l thought you would
advise him to move out.

803
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:24,600
Why? Sounds like you two
have things worked out,

804
01:11:24,700 --> 01:11:27,500
with the red areas and the green areas.

805
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:31,500
Gavin, ever since this thing started,
l've had trouble sleeping.

806
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:35,000
Most mornings l wake up sobbing.

807
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:37,700
l'm sorry. That's shitty.

808
01:11:38,300 --> 01:11:41,600
But this morning... l woke up screaming.

809
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:44,800
And l couldn't stop.

810
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:49,300
l need this to end. This has to end!

811
01:11:49,700 --> 01:11:52,200
- l suggested selling the house...
- No!

812
01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:56,300
OK. You both seem to agree on that.

813
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:58,500
Gavin.

814
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:02,800
l don't have much money,
but l could pay you.

815
01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:07,000
That'd be illegal.

816
01:12:15,700 --> 01:12:18,000
Besides money,

817
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:25,400
what would it take to get you
to help me, Gavin?

818
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:30,400
Put your shoes on, Barbara.
l haven't been into feet since '82.

819
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:33,500
- Have you ever made angry love?
- ls there any other way?

820
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:38,100
Stop it!

821
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:41,400
This is ridiculous. Button up!

822
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:46,000
You wanna settle this? Let's all sit down
and work it out, find some compromise.

823
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:49,800
- There is no compromise.
- Then l can't help you.

824
01:12:59,700 --> 01:13:01,800
Worth a shot.

825
01:13:10,700 --> 01:13:13,300
You know where l am
if you change your mind.

826
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:51,700
Sometimes l wonder what might have
happened... if l'd taken her offer.

827
01:13:54,100 --> 01:13:56,100
But l didn't.

828
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:03,200
l should have seen her toes
in the pit of my crotch as a cry for help.

829
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:06,900
- Stinking bitch.
- Dumb bastard.

830
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,700
- Slut.
- Scum.

831
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:10,800
- Filth.
- Faggot.

832
01:14:10,900 --> 01:14:12,700
- Morning, Susan.
- Morning.

833
01:14:19,900 --> 01:14:23,000
- l made you some sandwiches for the trip.
- l'm not hungry.

834
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:26,800
You may be hungry later.
Why don't you wrap these up?

835
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:33,100
There's some things l should tell you.
You're going offto college.

836
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:35,700
- You told me you loved me.
- Yes, l do love you.

837
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:40,400
And about drugs - don't do 'em. And sex -
don't catch anything. What else is there?

838
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:43,100
Just... about women.

839
01:14:44,900 --> 01:14:47,000
Don't be led by your emotions.

840
01:14:48,100 --> 01:14:53,200
Just cos you screwed up doesn't mean lwill,
so don't try and put your shit off on me.

841
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:56,200
Josh. Don't leave like this.

842
01:14:56,900 --> 01:15:00,700
- l'm pissed at you!
- So what do you want to do about it?

843
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:03,200
You wanna take a swing at me?

844
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:07,900
ls that gonna make you feel better?
Then go ahead.

845
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:21,900
What are you and Dad gonna do
to each other once we're not around?

846
01:15:21,900 --> 01:15:23,800
Don't be silly.

847
01:15:23,900 --> 01:15:27,100
Your father and l need some
time alone to work things out.

848
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:31,200
By the time summer school starts,
we'll have it settled.

849
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:36,000
Then l'll make a celebration dinner and
l'll bring it up - or you can come here.

850
01:15:36,100 --> 01:15:38,400
We'll work it out.

851
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:40,700
- You promise?
- Sure.

852
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:45,000
You know l love you.

853
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:49,400
- My sweet girl.
- So...

854
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:51,500
l'll be back for my things.

855
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:54,500
l will be thinking the best for you.

856
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,100
So long.

857
01:15:58,200 --> 01:16:01,100
- Take care, Susan.
- Goodbye!

858
01:16:08,300 --> 01:16:11,400
- You have a great time, kids.
- Don't worry about us.

859
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:13,500
Bye!

860
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:20,700
Here, Bennie.

861
01:16:30,900 --> 01:16:36,100
At 15, l became an evolutionist,
and it all became clear.

862
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:38,000
We came from mud.

863
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:43,200
And after 3.8 billion years of evolution,
at our core is still mud.

864
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:46,600
No divorce lawyer can doubt that.

865
01:16:49,900 --> 01:16:54,200
We can nail her. She's having
a black-tie dinner at 8 o'clock tonight.

866
01:16:54,300 --> 01:16:57,500
The food critic from The Post
called to confirm the time.

867
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:00,400
She sent me this phoney
exterminator's notice

868
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:04,800
saying the house is being gassed
for termites, so l'd stay away.

869
01:17:04,900 --> 01:17:09,500
- She can have dinner parties.
- She lied about the exterminator.

870
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:11,500
She can lie.

871
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:14,200
She took two of my Staffordshire figures.

872
01:17:14,300 --> 01:17:17,200
Any dealer would give you
at least $1,000 for them.

873
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:19,800
She is financing her dinner with my things.

874
01:17:19,900 --> 01:17:23,600
l want to file criminal charges
and l want her thrown in jail.

875
01:17:24,300 --> 01:17:28,900
- Unless you have proof, there aren't grounds.
- Wait a minute. Whose side are you on?

876
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Did she get to you?

877
01:17:31,100 --> 01:17:33,600
- Did you bang her?
- Not at all!

878
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:39,100
She was great. She was a gymnast.

879
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:44,200
She was?

880
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,200
Yeah.

881
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:49,700
Look, Oliver...

882
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:51,700
l lost my train ofthought.

883
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:54,100
Come on, Gavin. Let's have her arrested.

884
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:58,900
l don't think you should stay in the house.
Sell the house and divide the proceeds.

885
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:04,900
No. You're selling me out. You don't
think l got the guts to go to the mat.

886
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,300
You don't want to go to this mat, Oliver.

887
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:12,100
Look. l respect you, Oliver.
You're a professional. l'm a professional.

888
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:15,900
As a professional and a friend,
l'm telling you, one way or another,

889
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,600
you're gonna lose. Give it up.

890
01:18:19,900 --> 01:18:22,100
l understand what you're saying.

891
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:27,900
You're fired.

892
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:37,000
Now, some ofthe dishes tonight are new.

893
01:18:37,100 --> 01:18:39,900
Some, l've no doubt made for you before.

894
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:46,000
But they are all my favourite dishes
as you are all my favourite clients.

895
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,600
Hello, darling. Sorry l'm late.

896
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:58,300
Well, l guess l'd better not sit too close
to anybody because l have a bit of a cold.

897
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:18,300
Now l guess l'll go in and piss on the fish.

898
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:29,200
Oliver, these people are my clients.
You are messing with my business.

899
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:32,400
l have the food editor
from The Postout there.

900
01:19:33,100 --> 01:19:35,400
ls everything all right?

901
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:43,400
- l would never humiliate you like this.
- You're not equipped to, honey.

902
01:19:51,900 --> 01:19:54,500
Leaving so soon, baby doll? Huh?

903
01:19:54,900 --> 01:19:57,200
A family tiff seems to be developing.

904
01:19:57,300 --> 01:20:02,700
l don't know ifwe should leave, but
l definitely advise skipping the fish course.

905
01:20:13,700 --> 01:20:15,300
No!

906
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:26,200
What...? What...? What are you doing?!

907
01:20:26,300 --> 01:20:28,800
What...? What are you doing?!

908
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:33,300
Do you see what she's doing?!
Do you see that?!

909
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:46,800
Get out ofthe car, hon.

910
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:51,800
You're gonna have to kill me.

911
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:56,500
l mean it, Oliver.

912
01:21:56,600 --> 01:21:59,000
You don't have the guts!

913
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:01,900
Come on. Come on!

914
01:22:32,300 --> 01:22:34,700
This is absurd. lt's just absurd.

915
01:22:54,900 --> 01:22:56,900
OK, the gloves are off.

916
01:23:00,900 --> 01:23:03,800
Look, l don't wanna create a scene.

917
01:23:03,900 --> 01:23:07,100
l mean, l, uh,
live in this neighbourhood, too.

918
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:09,400
But the gloves are off!

919
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,100
Chickenshit.

920
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:42,300
Your guests would have loved this.

921
01:23:47,300 --> 01:23:50,500
l expected a little more
imagination from you, Ollie.

922
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:58,300
Guess l'll go clean up.

923
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:22,700
Not the Staffordshires.

924
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:28,600
- You love them as much as l do.
- More.

925
01:25:06,900 --> 01:25:09,200
Don't you touch that.

926
01:25:11,300 --> 01:25:13,400
What are you doing?!

927
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:23,300
- Give that to me!
- Let go!

928
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:25,400
Give it to me!

929
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:37,500
Good night.

930
01:25:58,500 --> 01:26:00,600
Bennie?

931
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:04,500
Bennie!

932
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:09,500
Bennie?

933
01:26:17,900 --> 01:26:22,400
The Bermuda high-pressure system is
keeping hot weatherin the Potomac area.

934
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:24,500
Look fora high today of92 degrees.

935
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:27,100
Not a good day to do strenuous exercise.

936
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:30,800
Good advice, especiallyifyou
have respiratoryproblems.

937
01:26:30,900 --> 01:26:33,100
Sara Murphyis at the Pentagon

938
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:36,700
with a report on whether women
still fiind uniforms sexyformen.

939
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:39,700
So far, it was a pretty normal
divorce scenario.

940
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:43,700
A few bruises, some broken dishes,
a pissed-on fish.

941
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:47,800
But l think you should have
a drink for this next part.

942
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:54,100
There are two dilemmas...
that rattle the human skull.

943
01:26:56,700 --> 01:27:00,400
How do you hold onto
someone who won't stay?

944
01:27:01,900 --> 01:27:05,800
And how do you get rid of
someone who won't go?

945
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:59,000
l opened a great old one, to let it breathe.

946
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:07,200
You look beautiful.

947
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:10,000
- l feel good.
- l do, too.

948
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:13,400
The Larrabee confirmation hearing
went very well today.

949
01:28:16,300 --> 01:28:21,400
l was surprised, happily surprised,
by your invitation.

950
01:28:23,100 --> 01:28:27,300
Thank you for the wine.
l hope it's not poisoned.

951
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:41,700
Same here.

952
01:29:21,500 --> 01:29:24,400
- We've made a mess ofthings, Oliver.
- We sure have.

953
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:29,200
- l want to start living a normal life again.
- l do too, Barbara.

954
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:35,100
Sitting here like this, it's...
it's hard to believe we can't be happy.

955
01:29:36,100 --> 01:29:39,500
We can be happy... just not together.

956
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:43,400
l want to ask you one last time to leave.

957
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:48,300
l can't do that. l won't.

958
01:29:50,100 --> 01:29:52,600
You make so much money, Oliver.

959
01:29:52,700 --> 01:29:55,500
You can buy another house
and replace everything.

960
01:29:55,700 --> 01:29:57,800
Except you.

961
01:29:58,500 --> 01:30:03,700
You may find this hard to believe...
but l still love you.

962
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:06,400
l still...

963
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:08,500
want you.

964
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:15,100
- l find it hard to believe.
- What you can't believe is l don't want you.

965
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:20,900
Well, l... Yeah, l have
a problem with that. l mean,

966
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,400
l think l'm a good person, as people go...

967
01:30:26,100 --> 01:30:29,000
What can we do to patch things up?

968
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:33,900
- l don't know.
- Tell me.

969
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,600
- l can't.
- Please.

970
01:30:36,700 --> 01:30:40,600
- l don't know.
- Please tell me. Please?

971
01:30:40,600 --> 01:30:43,100
- Just tell me.
- Stop it!

972
01:30:45,900 --> 01:30:48,400
l guess you don't wanna talk about it.

973
01:30:48,500 --> 01:30:50,700
No, l don't wanna talk about it.

974
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:52,600
Oliver,

975
01:30:52,700 --> 01:30:57,600
if you don't get out of here now,
you have no idea how far l'll go.

976
01:30:57,700 --> 01:30:59,800
How far? Tell me.

977
01:30:59,900 --> 01:31:03,300
We've been horrible to each other,
but we had something - we still do.

978
01:31:03,400 --> 01:31:05,700
We haven't passed any point of no return.

979
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:10,600
- l have.
- l'm not convinced.

980
01:31:10,700 --> 01:31:14,500
Nobody who makes pâté this good
can be all bad.

981
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:23,100
That depends on what the pâté is made of.

982
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:35,600
Woof.

983
01:31:44,300 --> 01:31:46,000
Bennie?

984
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,600
A good dog to the last bite.

985
01:31:59,300 --> 01:32:01,800
Goddamn you!

986
01:32:03,900 --> 01:32:06,600
Jesus Christ!

987
01:32:57,800 --> 01:32:59,900
l'll give you the chandelier.

988
01:33:16,700 --> 01:33:18,500
Barbara?

989
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,500
Shit!

990
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:25,800
You can't get out!
l'm gonna find you, sweetness.

991
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:28,500
l know this house too well!

992
01:33:29,900 --> 01:33:32,100
Where the hell is she?

993
01:35:01,500 --> 01:35:04,600
l guess l'm on top now. And you're helpless.

994
01:35:05,400 --> 01:35:08,200
l can do anything l want.

995
01:35:08,300 --> 01:35:10,300
Stop it! l mean it! Stop it!

996
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:18,100
Oh, God. Oh, you smell so dirty-sweet.

997
01:35:20,300 --> 01:35:23,600
Oh, Barbie... Oh, we need this, Barbie. Yeah...

998
01:35:23,700 --> 01:35:25,700
No, don't talk!

999
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:28,200
Don't talk. Oliver,

1000
01:35:29,100 --> 01:35:33,500
l want to say hello
to the bald avenger. Please.

1001
01:35:36,700 --> 01:35:38,900
You haven't called him that in years.

1002
01:35:41,900 --> 01:35:44,900
Oh, Barbara! Oh, Barbara! Oh!

1003
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:48,800
Oh, yes!

1004
01:35:52,700 --> 01:35:54,800
Oh, Barbara...

1005
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,100
Oh, God!

1006
01:36:18,100 --> 01:36:20,300
Was it as good for you as it was for me?

1007
01:37:04,300 --> 01:37:06,500
Oh, what's going on here?

1008
01:37:41,700 --> 01:37:43,800
Oh, l'm sorry.

1009
01:37:43,900 --> 01:37:46,000
l thought you were Barbara.

1010
01:37:46,700 --> 01:37:50,400
Mr Rose, what's going on here? Are you OK?

1011
01:37:51,300 --> 01:37:53,800
l'm... l'm fine. Fine.

1012
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:56,700
Listen, Susan,

1013
01:37:56,800 --> 01:38:01,100
l'm in the middle of something now.
l... l... l really can't talk about it.

1014
01:38:01,200 --> 01:38:03,200
Let me get the door for you.

1015
01:38:03,300 --> 01:38:06,900
- ls Mrs Rose all right?
- Yes, she's fine.

1016
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:11,600
Where is she? ls she OK?
You're sure she's all right?

1017
01:38:11,700 --> 01:38:15,400
Barbara. Susan's here!

1018
01:38:15,500 --> 01:38:19,000
- She wants to know ifyou're OK.
- Never better.

1019
01:38:23,400 --> 01:38:25,800
Thank you for dropping by, Susan.

1020
01:38:26,600 --> 01:38:29,000
Come outside with me, Mr Rose.

1021
01:38:29,100 --> 01:38:31,100
Let's go.

1022
01:38:35,400 --> 01:38:37,600
Wait a minute. l forgot something.

1023
01:38:38,400 --> 01:38:40,400
What?

1024
01:38:40,500 --> 01:38:42,600
- Barbara.
- No!

1025
01:38:42,600 --> 01:38:45,500
Mr Rose! Mr Rose!

1026
01:38:46,700 --> 01:38:48,800
Oh, no!

1027
01:38:51,400 --> 01:38:54,800
Oh, mein Gott. Mrs Rose!

1028
01:39:49,600 --> 01:39:52,100
What fresh hell is this?

1029
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,100
Hi.

1030
01:40:31,600 --> 01:40:34,000
l brought you a surprise.

1031
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:26,800
You are ajerk.

1032
01:41:33,900 --> 01:41:36,000
l'll tell you what.

1033
01:41:37,500 --> 01:41:40,000
You say it's mine

1034
01:41:40,100 --> 01:41:43,100
and you can have everything in this house.

1035
01:41:44,700 --> 01:41:46,700
OK.

1036
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:48,600
lt's mine.

1037
01:42:25,900 --> 01:42:29,900
Barbara! Barbara, l'm sorry.
Are you all right? You OK?

1038
01:42:29,900 --> 01:42:31,100
You OK?

1039
01:43:15,500 --> 01:43:17,900
Well, well, well!

1040
01:43:21,400 --> 01:43:25,400
l'd be glad to help you...
in exchange for the house.

1041
01:43:26,500 --> 01:43:28,000
No.

1042
01:43:28,100 --> 01:43:32,000
Please don't break
the terrazzo floor when you land.

1043
01:43:40,200 --> 01:43:42,600
Oh! That's better.

1044
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:52,100
l'm gonna save you whether you like it or not.

1045
01:43:52,200 --> 01:43:54,600
That won't work.

1046
01:43:55,300 --> 01:43:57,800
lt's too heavy. lt'll pull you off.

1047
01:43:58,100 --> 01:44:00,600
lt'll work.

1048
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:19,300
Oliver!

1049
01:44:36,400 --> 01:44:38,500
Almost.

1050
01:44:40,100 --> 01:44:42,600
All right. All right.

1051
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:47,000
l think l can swing this over to the balcony.

1052
01:44:47,100 --> 01:44:49,300
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

1053
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:55,500
l loosened the bolt.
l was gonna drop it on you.

1054
01:44:56,800 --> 01:44:59,100
Ooh, that's a good one.

1055
01:45:05,100 --> 01:45:07,300
Gavin! Gavin!

1056
01:45:08,500 --> 01:45:12,300
- Gavin...
- Uh, Susan, let me stop the car first!

1057
01:45:12,400 --> 01:45:15,600
Thank God you're here!
l thought you'd never arrive.

1058
01:45:15,700 --> 01:45:18,200
They're in there. They're over the edge!

1059
01:45:19,900 --> 01:45:25,000
l guess at this point, there's no reason
to be anything but absolutely honest.

1060
01:45:26,200 --> 01:45:30,600
Through all that's happened...
l always loved you.

1061
01:45:33,400 --> 01:45:35,500
l know.

1062
01:45:37,900 --> 01:45:40,800
And through all this,

1063
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:43,300
you loved me too, didn't you?

1064
01:45:51,800 --> 01:45:54,100
Get that, would you, Oliver?

1065
01:45:56,700 --> 01:46:00,000
- No?
- No, no. OK, we go in.

1066
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:05,200
Oh, mein Gott.

1067
01:46:06,100 --> 01:46:08,800
Oliver! Barbara!

1068
01:46:08,900 --> 01:46:10,500
- Gavin!
- Gavin!

1069
01:46:10,900 --> 01:46:14,200
- Gavin, get a ladder!
- OK!

1070
01:46:18,300 --> 01:46:20,700
l knew everything would be all right.

1071
01:46:29,100 --> 01:46:30,700
Gavin!

1072
01:46:33,100 --> 01:46:36,200
- Gavin!
- Gavin!

1073
01:46:43,700 --> 01:46:47,000
We're gonna be all right.
You see those two wires?

1074
01:46:47,100 --> 01:46:48,400
Yeah.

1075
01:46:48,600 --> 01:46:52,900
Each ofthem can hold... at least 200 pounds.

1076
01:48:06,600 --> 01:48:08,900
We're coming!

1077
01:49:11,200 --> 01:49:14,200
Mein Gott. They are dead.

1078
01:49:35,600 --> 01:49:37,600
Some story, huh?

1079
01:49:42,500 --> 01:49:45,300
What's the moral?

1080
01:49:45,400 --> 01:49:49,500
Other than dog people should marry
dog people and cat people, cat people.

1081
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,800
l don't know.

1082
01:49:54,900 --> 01:49:57,400
lt could be just this:

1083
01:49:57,500 --> 01:50:01,600
a civilised divorce
is a contradiction in terms.

1084
01:50:03,600 --> 01:50:07,000
Maybe because ofwhat happened,
l've become too traditional.

1085
01:50:07,100 --> 01:50:11,100
Maybe it's not natural to stay
married to one person for life.

1086
01:50:11,800 --> 01:50:14,000
My parents did it.

1087
01:50:14,100 --> 01:50:16,200
63 years.

1088
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:19,600
A few of 'em good!

1089
01:50:23,100 --> 01:50:25,600
So, look. Here it is.

1090
01:50:25,600 --> 01:50:28,400
We can begin.

1091
01:50:28,500 --> 01:50:30,600
When it comes to your wife,

1092
01:50:30,700 --> 01:50:36,200
l'm going to urge you to be generous
to the point of night sweats.

1093
01:50:37,200 --> 01:50:42,700
The all-important thing is to get you through
this as quickly and cleanly as possible

1094
01:50:42,800 --> 01:50:46,000
so that you can begin rebuilding your life.

1095
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,100
OK?

1096
01:50:50,700 --> 01:50:52,800
Or...

1097
01:50:55,300 --> 01:50:57,600
you can get up

1098
01:50:57,700 --> 01:51:00,000
and go home,

1099
01:51:00,100 --> 01:51:04,300
and try to find some shred

1100
01:51:04,400 --> 01:51:08,600
of what you once loved about
the sweetheart ofyour youth.

1101
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,100
lt's your life.

1102
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,400
Take a minute.

1103
01:51:57,500 --> 01:52:01,300
Hi, what are you doing?
l'm coming home. Love you. Bye.

1104
01:52:02,300 --> 00:00:00,000
