.:: HOLE::.

2
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,600
Stinks.

3
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,200
Mom, Dane just said stinks.

4
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,600
Don't say stink Dane.

5
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,400
I thought you said that this wasn't that different
from the last place?

6
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,000
It will be! Once we get our stuff moved in.

7
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,600
Yeah except for the 2,000 mile walk
to go hang out with my friends.

8
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,709
You will make new friends.

9
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:36,710
Better friends.

10
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,160
Got the biggest room.

11
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,960
Well! This was nice of someone.

12
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:51,400
Oh that's so sweet.
Did Aunt Bee bake us a pie?

13
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,000
This place sux (sucks).

14
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,098
Hey, There's a basket in the street.

15
00:02:00,099 --> 00:02:01,360
Let's go play.

16
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,000
Dane.

17
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,094
What the hell's your problem?

18
00:02:06,095 --> 00:02:07,585
Let's go play!

19
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,000
Go have fun.

20
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,520
Jerk.

21
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,912
Hi, I'll play with you honey.

22
00:02:15,913 --> 00:02:17,038
You know? Forget it.

23
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,840
This is a change for Lucas too okay?

24
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,400
- Are you joking me?
- No, I'm not.

25
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,549
All you have to do is put him
in his room and put on cartoons.

26
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:33,172
And he's fine.

27
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,389
And perhaps spend a little bit more
time with him. What do you say?

28
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,600
Any more time and I...
I'll probably strangle him.

29
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,920
What happen to the old Dane, I used
to know that would

30
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,400
draw rainbows and people
with smiley faces on them?

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,400
I grew up.

32
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,800
Did ya?

33
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,920
But please do not to take
this out on Lucas, okay?

34
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,160
It is not his fault that
we had to move.

35
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,600
I had to do it.
I could not take a chance.

36
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,400
I am sorry about your friends.

37
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,400
I'm sorry about having to move again.

38
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,000
but I would really like
this to workout.

39
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,200
I would like you to help me make it work.

40
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,560
It means no more fighting
no more trouble at school.

41
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,400
I need you to be better then
the things you have seen.

42
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,800
What's that supposed to mean?

43
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,400
It means, I would like us
to be happy. Okay?

44
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,600
We could all use a little bit
more happy in our lives.

45
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,960
See this... I'm very happy.
I am.

46
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,120
That's great...

47
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,600
It's not too bad...
We're make it work?

48
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,520
There's another box in the back of the truck.
Honey, if you would get it please?

49
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,400
This one?
- Yeah. That's good.

50
00:03:48,401 --> 00:03:49,401
Careful.

51
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,800
Mom!

52
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,200
Dane why did you bring this?

53
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,200
To help Lucas build his Bozo phobia.

54
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,284
Shut up God.
- Mom, Lucas just said, "Shut up."

55
00:04:01,285 --> 00:04:05,800
Do the two of you realise that you're embarrassing
yourselves in front of our new neighbour?

56
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,760
Better than Mr. Hide walking in
Clark Street in boxers. Doesn't it?

57
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,600
Hey, Dane! Where do you want me to put
your Jonah's record CD's?

58
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,400
Oooh... You're into such trouble.

59
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,600
What new?

60
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,789
That goes in the basement, sweetie!

61
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:25,999
Thanks! 
- Okay!

62
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,200
- Why do you baby him so much?
- Why? You jealous?

63
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You okay, kid?
- Yeah...

64
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,200
Just go talk to him.
He said he was sorry.

65
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,760
I'm so done with him.

66
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,600
You've been saying that since the fifth grade.
- I know right.

67
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,080
Okay you guys, call me if there's any problems.

68
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,680
but I don't want any problems.
So please don't call me.

69
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,334
I need this stuff to go well.

70
00:06:45,335 --> 00:06:46,944
Are we cool?

71
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,634
Promise me the both of you.

72
00:06:48,635 --> 00:06:49,635
Promise.

73
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,000
Scout's honor.

74
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,600
Dane... I hate to tell you this
but you were never a scout. My friend.

75
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:59,079
Actually I thought about once because of the cookies.
- Because a girl scouts losing.

76
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,440
I love you.
Don't pester your brother, okay?

77
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,000
- Good luck, Mom.
- Thank you.

78
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,200
And guys! Do things together. Two of you.
Please ... Dane.

79
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,800
See you guys later!

80
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,400
Let's go throw.

81
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,600
I'm busy.
- Doing what?

82
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,200
Nothing.
Go away.

83
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,280
C'mon!
You can stare at her outside. Okay!

84
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,400
I said I'm busy.
Now get outta here. I don't feel like it.

85
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,320
You never feel like it.

86
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,600
No. No.

87
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,000
I will kill you.

88
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,200
Hello!

89
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,440
New neighbors.

90
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,600
I'm Lucas.
We just moved here.

91
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,240
Hi, Lucas.
I'm Julie.

92
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,480
Nice to meet you, Julie.
With my brother Dane, and my mom Susan.

93
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,480
He's there up there.

94
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,520
You want to know my brother?

95
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,400
Dane like it better in Brooklyn.

96
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,360
I gotta go.

97
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,000
Mom?

98
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,760
Hey, buddy.

99
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,600
You ever bite me again, I'm gonna...

100
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,816
What's your problem? 

101
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:11,782
Dickhead!

102
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,895
Want you to just play with me.

103
00:09:12,896 --> 00:09:14,415
Oh Really? You want me to play with you?

104
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:15,768
Yes...
- I have no problem!

105
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,200
Playing with you!

106
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,336
Mom's gonna be pissed with you.

107
00:09:27,337 --> 00:09:28,619
It's your fault!

108
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,800
What is that?

109
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,000
Don't know.

110
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,600
Here help me get this.

111
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,800
That's a lot of locks.

112
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,080
Probably keep you from gas pipes or something.

113
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,200
Or a treasure maybe?

114
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,600
Go look for the keys.

115
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,800
They're not down here.

116
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,000
If there's treasure,
I get half.

117
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,400
This is just a hole.

118
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,200
Cold.

119
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,745
How deep do you think it is?

120
00:11:21,746 --> 00:11:22,761
I don't know.

121
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,200
Okay, go ahead.

122
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Do you hear anything?

123
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,400
That's really weird?

124
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,600
Maybe it's like some kinda tunnel or something?

125
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,600
To where?

126
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,600
I don't know I mean. 
It's got to have a bottom right?

127
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,520
Hello!

128
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,233
Hey.

129
00:12:23,862 --> 00:12:24,862
What?

130
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,061
How does it do that?

131
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:52,879
I don't know.

132
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,002
What you do?

133
00:12:55,702 --> 00:12:57,611
Nothing. It's if catch on or something.

134
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,800
So! You two didn't kill each other?

135
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,200
Not yet.

136
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,200
This is Julie.

137
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,200
Hi, Dane!

138
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,400
The boy who hates it here.

139
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,722
Do you wanna look at our hole?

140
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:21,600
I'm sorry?

141
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,960
Nothing.

142
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,880
We got this hole in the floor.
It's no big deal.

143
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,446
It's that what you do for fun in Brooklyn?

144
00:13:29,447 --> 00:13:30,842
Play with your holes?

145
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,400
What is it?

146
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,017
Our hole.

147
00:13:35,018 --> 00:13:36,018
Well! We're not really sure what?

148
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,360
Hey Charlie!
What do you think?

149
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,000
Charlie doesn't like your hole very much.

150
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,600
Can't see the bottom.

151
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,400
Maybe it's just a crawl space or something.

152
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,000
Watch!

153
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,000
That was weird.

154
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,760
Okay ...

155
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,280
This is so cool.

156
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,400
Is it working?
- Yeah.

157
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,400
Think so.

158
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,000
So what exactly you think you gonna see?

159
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,600
I don't know?

160
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,880
Could be like a... like a underground tomb.
Like the catacombs, or something?

161
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,619
The catacombs of Bensonville?

162
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,695
Seriously doubt that.

163
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:20,000
I think its just a... really deep hole,
that 'Creepy Carl' dug up.

164
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,899
Who's 'Creepy Carl' ?

165
00:15:21,913 --> 00:15:23,320
The guy that used to live here.

166
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:28,440
Now he lives in the old glove factory in the other side of town.

167
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,640
Yeah! Let's go see what the inside of a hole looks like.

168
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,400
Is it working?
- Yeah.

169
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,600
I think so.

170
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,480
I told you guys there's nothing down there.
It's just a hole.

171
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:57,400
A hole with no bottom in the basement of our house.
How does that make any sense?

172
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,200
Woah! Did you see that?

173
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,707
Right there.

174
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:12,324
See? There's something.

175
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,000
Or anything.

176
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:20,840
Like a light coming
through a crack in the...

177
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,800
Or a aliens.

178
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,297
Or an egg.

179
00:16:25,298 --> 00:16:26,298
Or an alien egg.

180
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,200
How do you even come out with this...
It's not in the...

181
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,000
Hey guys!
- Hi! Mom.

182
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Just watching some TV.
- Cool.

183
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,680
Yeah! What is it?

184
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:40,760
Oh! Nothing just stupid show really.
Just about to turn it off actually.

185
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,600
This is Julie. From next door.
- Hi, Julie from next door.

186
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,440
Hello!

187
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,000
I brought plenty of Chinese food in case you're hungry?

188
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,160
Thanks but I should... I should go.

189
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:57,600
My mom probably thinks I'm already hitting 
up the new neighbours for gay way drugs.

190
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,200
I'll see you later?

191
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,240
Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

192
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,800
Bye Lucas. I'll see you later.

193
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,280
You might have been safer in the city. My friend.

194
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,389
What have you guys been doing all day?

195
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:11,374
We found this cool...

196
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,600
Nothing.

197
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,599
We just kinda hung out.

198
00:17:15,046 --> 00:17:15,763
How's the new job?

199
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,600
Good.
Wait a minute...

200
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,600
Did you just... ask me about my life?

201
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:26,600
My Goodness! Couple of days in a small town
and look how polite you are?

202
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,429
I heard something.

203
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:55,430
Whatever...

204
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:43,360
Why do I have to do it today?
- Because your school registration is today. Sweetheart.

205
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,600
And I change my shift at the hospital to do it. 
Please stop...

206
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,600
Hold still baby. We're late.

207
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,800
Why doesn't Dane have to do it?

208
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,400
Because I'm not in a school where 
they make you take naps and drink out of sippy cup.

209
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,000
You can do me! Dickhead!
- Hey! hey, hey...

210
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,360
Okay I know he did not learn that on Sponge Bob.

211
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:59,920
And Dane is not going today because
his registration is next week.

212
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,680
What are you planning on doing 
today besides causing trouble?

213
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,302
Well, Julie's gonna show me around this ghost town.

214
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:07,017
So! That should take about... I don't know? 10 minutes.

215
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,320
Alright. Please be back by 4, 
I have to go to work. Thank you.

216
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,520
C'mon sweetie let's go.

217
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,800
Ready, tiger?
- Bensonville, here we come.

218
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,000
Not quite Brooklyn, huh?
- Not quite.

219
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,600
So... Is that where you lived your whole life?

220
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,800
No! Actually I was born in Queens.

221
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,200
And the... we moved
to Philly (Philadelphia), Boston,

222
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,880
DC (Washington) and then back to Brooklyn.

223
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,720
Oh! And... I'd say... I think Jersey is 
somewhere in there too. I don't really remember.

224
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,569
Do you even bother to unpack the boxes?

225
00:20:48,654 --> 00:20:51,341
Yeah everytime. It's kinda like...

226
00:20:51,342 --> 00:20:56,400
My mom always assure that the next move is 
gonna be the last one. Type of thing... you know?

227
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,000
She seems nice.
- Yeah.

228
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,800
What about your dad?
- I don't have one.

229
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,200
Sorry.

230
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,920
"Rolic Gardens"?
Seriously. Can we go there?

231
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:10,200
I hate that place.
Besides, it's not open anyway.

232
00:21:13,577 --> 00:21:17,400
Yeah... the weather's a little bipolar,
as you can see.

233
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,800
But other than that it's not that bad here.

234
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:24,480
I mean, school sucks,
but I'm sure its sucked in Brooklyn too right?

235
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,400
Yeah.

236
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,400
Thus... You guys are like celebrities.

237
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:33,520
I mean most people move out of Bensonville,
not in it.

238
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,600
Really?

239
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,280
How bout your genuine Bensonville burger?

240
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:44,200
How is that one compared to the... 
Brooklyn, Boston, Philly burgers?

241
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,320
Pretty good.

242
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:48,789
Yeah, that's because they mix it up with squirrels out here.

243
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:49,790
Really?

244
00:21:50,971 --> 00:21:51,971
Good?

245
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,120
Just kidding.

246
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:10,200
Your boyfriend gave you that?
- Why? You jealous?

247
00:22:10,999 --> 00:22:11,999
No...

248
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,200
Just a friend.

249
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:20,200
So... what's up with you guys 
moving around all the time?

250
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,400
Nothing.

251
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,800
People usually don't move
around the country for no reason.

252
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,000
I do not know ...

253
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:34,238
My mom just... wants to find a good job.
We want to find places for Lucas like a...

254
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,320
I do not know.
There is no reason really.

255
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,200
Dane, I say to come home by 4,
not start home at 4.

256
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,640
Would you just please come home alright!
I got to go to work.

257
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,720
Listen, sweetheart, honey.
I've got to go to work.

258
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,320
So, Dane will be home any second I promise. So...

259
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:59,400
Don't go anywhere kay?
Be a good boy. I love you.

260
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,924
I love you, soldier.
- I love you too.

261
00:23:00,925 --> 00:23:01,925
Okay.

262
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,200
Mission failed ...

263
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,600
Okay, Let's see how you like it.

264
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Hey! You okay?

265
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,640
Shit!

266
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,880
Hang on a second!

267
00:25:09,378 --> 00:25:10,378
Hey!

268
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,160
This isn't funny!

269
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,400
Dane!

270
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,760
Dane!

271
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,800
Hello?

272
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:05,120
Julie! what are you doing here in the dark?

273
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,840
Hiding from your new boyfriend?

274
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,400
Let's get outta here.

275
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,000
Hello!

276
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,520
This is Lucas Thompson!

277
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,000
What's wrong with you?

278
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,800
He came after me.

279
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,000
What?

280
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,400
That clown puppet thing.

281
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,314
The one you try to scare me with.

282
00:29:05,315 --> 00:29:07,364
It's trying to get up here.

283
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,520
No!

284
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,400
He was right there.

285
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,600
He chased me.

286
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,000
The puppet chased you?

287
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,840
The one you put in my bed.

288
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:29,480
Lucas I have no idea what you're talking about.
I didn't put any clown puppet inside your room.

289
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,360
Yeah, you did!

290
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,996
I mean, I might have... 
If I would have thought about it. But...

291
00:29:33,997 --> 00:29:34,997
I didn't.

292
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,920
It... It was there!

293
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,560
On the steps ?
- In my bed.

294
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,960
Then I put it in your bed to scare you,

295
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,200
and then it was downstairs.

296
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,400
Okay! You know what?

297
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:53,640
You got all kinds of weird crap going on in there,
I don't even want to know about it.

298
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,520
but whatever. Clown's gone.
So we're cool.

299
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,000
It's still down there somewhere!

300
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,200
Okay, let's go look.

301
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,600
It was in here.

302
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,240
Hey! You know what? You're wasting my time.
There's nothing down here.

303
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,480
Who the hell's that?

304
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,208
One of your little friends?

305
00:30:35,926 --> 00:30:37,605
I don't have any friends.

306
00:30:44,287 --> 00:30:45,287
Hey!

307
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,800
Hey, little girl! You lost or something?

308
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,400
I don't want to die.

309
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,600
Dane! let's just stay down here.

310
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,686
Did you close that when you came home?

311
00:31:39,826 --> 00:31:41,835
I don't remember.

312
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,880
Is that him?

313
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,267
You didn't happen to see a little girl run by here did you?


314
00:31:51,268 --> 00:31:51,715
Shut up.

315
00:31:51,716 --> 00:31:53,081
Eh... little girl?

316
00:31:53,082 --> 00:31:54,962
She had blood dripping from her eyes.

317
00:31:54,963 --> 00:31:57,760
What?
- She just had a little makeup on. Don't worry about it.

318
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,215
It's all good! Thanks!

319
00:31:59,216 --> 00:32:00,216
Hi, Dane!

320
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,320
Okay... I'm gonna look upstairs.
Shit!

321
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,800
Hey!
Shut up!

322
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,440
So! What's the deal with this little girl?

323
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,600
You guys know her?
- No!

324
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,388
I didn't know the clown either.

325
00:32:22,389 --> 00:32:23,389
What clown?

326
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,600
Nothing! He...

327
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:28,240
He had a dream last night and got scared 
because of this  stupid thing about clowns.

328
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,800
No, I don't.

329
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,840
But the little girl... she
was... she was in this house?

330
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:39,000
She said she did not want to die.
- You know what, dude ...?

331
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,960
You don't have to answer every single question.

332
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,280
Seriously! I'm not in the mood.

333
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,600
Dane!

334
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,430
Hello!

335
00:33:29,431 --> 00:33:30,431
Dane, please...

336
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,536
Gotta be in there right?

337
00:33:32,537 --> 00:33:34,305
Dane. Close it.

338
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,600
Are you crazy?

339
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,320
I don't know? We all... we all saw that right?

340
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,400
You're talking about the little girl that 
just crawled into the bottomless pit under your house?

341
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:51,120
Yeah!
I think we all saw that.

342
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,400
Some kinda passage way for dead people.

343
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:03,160
Why would a little girl be down here?

344
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:06,600
I'd rather know,
why she followed me into the bathroom at the diner?

345
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,316
- Maybe it's a wormhole?

346
00:34:08,317 --> 00:34:09,317
A what?

347
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,600
A Wormhole. Like a doorway between different universes.

348
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,000
Oh, my gosh!
- What?

349
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,480
Wow! Okay! You know what? You need to stop 
reading so much.Trains you little geek.

350
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,360
Pizza guy.

351
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,640
Hey.

352
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,600
Okay.

353
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,301
Anything yet?

354
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:38,867
No...

355
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,200
When's mom gonna come home?.
- Not til midnight.

356
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:47,000
Should've called her.
- No!... Bad idea.

357
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:53,400
Seriously, if you say anything she's just gonna spaz out.
Gets packed up by tonight.

358
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:58,200
It's fine with me. If it's okay with you? Right?
Would you?

359
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,360
Yeah!.
I mean... but...

360
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:07,600
What do you think? We should... you know 
see what we got before we say anything.

361
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,780
I know what you've got.

362
00:35:09,781 --> 00:35:13,510
You've got a gateway to hell underneath your house.

363
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,600
And that is really cool.

364
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,600
What is wrong with you?!

365
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,917
I know... I probably wouldn't understand anyway, right?

366
00:35:40,918 --> 00:35:41,918
Right. Great!

367
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:46,330
Listen, you guys. It's getting late,
so don't stay down here much longer. Alright!

368
00:35:46,299 --> 00:35:49,918
and, and, and you too. 
You need to go home. Right. And...

369
00:35:49,919 --> 00:35:52,520
Dane clean that up, please.

370
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,800
Good God ...

371
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,400
What do we do now?

372
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,000
Nothing I guess.

373
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,840
And if that little girl comes
into my room tonight?

374
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,600
Guess it's good luck.

375
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,880
Where'd you put the lock?

376
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,680
I didn't touch them.

377
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,680
Where are they then?

378
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:48,880
Life is ridiculous and boring,
before you move here.

379
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,399
I'd better go.

380
00:36:51,808 --> 00:36:53,376
Good nite...

381
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,097
Hey, Mom.
- Hey guys.

382
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,400
This is Dr. Newman.
We work at the hospital together.

383
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,200
It's Travis.

384
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,400
Hi.
- Hi.

385
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,986
So what are you fellas doing down there?

386
00:37:43,987 --> 00:37:44,987
Little war game?

387
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,200
Yeah, something like that.

388
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:53,360
But it's actually passed our beddy 
bye time isn't it mommy dear?

389
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:57,000
A snack perhaps? Before you go to bed? 
Are you hungry?

390
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,800
Alright you guys? Good night! 
I love you!

391
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:03,200
Good night, baby!
- Nice to meet you.

392
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,360
I am so sorry about Dane.

393
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,518
It's just that he's not used to the idea of me...

394
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:09,521
You don't have to explain. I get it.

395
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,566
His father is not a very nice person.

396
00:38:11,567 --> 00:38:15,680
We probably got married too young!
And I stayed probably too long...

397
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,388
Susan...

398
00:38:16,389 --> 00:38:19,016
It's... it's okay.

399
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,680
Think she's probably gonna marry him.

400
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,200
Shut up.

401
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,800
Hi!

402
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,960
Dane!

403
00:38:51,619 --> 00:38:53,468
Dane...!
- Yeah. Hang on.

404
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,600
Hi!
- How's up?

405
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,041
I... just saw your mom. I thought you 
guys were gonna wait for me?

406
00:39:04,042 --> 00:39:06,800
You know what? I really don't 
want to mess with it today.

407
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,920
Why not?
- I don't know. I just don't.

408
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:16,240
You forget where you live now?
What else we have to do around here?

409
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,200
I think you guys better see this!

410
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,400
Maybe mom did it?

411
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,360
Yeah... like she could have just shoved this thing.

412
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:39,480
Or Satan's just pissed off. 
We're just blocking his gateway to hell.

413
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,720
I bet he's strong.

414
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,200
Is that yours?

415
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:56,800
No.

416
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,040
Let's see how Satan
does with nails.

417
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,600
So... what do you do now?

418
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:16,160
I want to find out why the 
hell's there's a hole in my basement.

419
00:40:17,329 --> 00:40:18,914
That weird guy you said that lived here before?

420
00:40:18,915 --> 00:40:20,516
Creepy Freddy? - Creepy Carl?

421
00:40:20,517 --> 00:40:21,749
Yeah!

422
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,400
Where is this glove factory?

423
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,600
"Private Land", "No Trespassing"

424
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,240
It's locked.

425
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,120
Let's go home.

426
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,120
Somebody have done that before.

427
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:45,319
Yeah! That somebody always gets in trouble too.

428
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:48,000
It's Bensonville?
What are they gonna do? Send a cop?

429
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,720
So how do you know where'll we're going?

430
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:55,360
Bensonville is my playground, my friends.

431
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:59,480
Okay! So this Freaky Freddy dude...
- Creepy Carl.

432
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:03,080
Yeah! Whatever!
He's like crazy, right?

433
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:07,480
I guess...
Used to be pretty normal.

434
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:11,960
I don't know ... gone a little nuts! 
We'll hear him screaming from next door.

435
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:18,560
And then one day he disappeared and moved out here.

436
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,913
You like?

437
00:41:19,914 --> 00:41:21,824
Creepy Carl sure keeps it cold in here.

438
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,400
That is a lot of wattage.

439
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,639
Is that him?

440
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:00,640
Yeah...

441
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,960
Carl?

442
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,427
Carl? 

443
00:42:09,428 --> 00:42:10,428
Hi!

444
00:42:11,155 --> 00:42:12,155
I'm Julie.

445
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,647
Remember me?

446
00:42:19,648 --> 00:42:21,992
I see your name...
- Ya! I remember.

447
00:42:24,702 --> 00:42:26,089
We're really sorry to bother you like this...

448
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:29,192
We just have to ask you about your old house.

449
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,117
What about it?

450
00:42:30,118 --> 00:42:31,118
Let's just leave!

451
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,581
I'm... I'm Dane and the...

452
00:42:34,582 --> 00:42:35,953
I live in the house now.

453
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:40,040
We found your hole and we...

454
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,840
You took the locks off?
- Yeah.

455
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:48,640
You can't take the locks off.

456
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:51,809
We're just trying to figure out where it leads or...

457
00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:53,370
What... what's under there.

458
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,160
The Darkness!

459
00:42:56,161 --> 00:42:57,161
It saw you! Didn't it?

460
00:42:58,520 --> 00:42:59,880
Didn't it?
- No! We... we...

461
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:02,878
We saw a little girl okay. You can relax.

462
00:43:02,879 --> 00:43:05,360
No, no. It saw you.

463
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,635
You shouldn't have done it. You shouldn't have opened it!

464
00:43:08,636 --> 00:43:10,578
God dammit! Why did you open it!

465
00:43:10,986 --> 00:43:13,119
Look, Okay. We just want to know,
if you build the hole...

466
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:16,239
And what's it about...
- Nobody build the hole!

467
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:20,291
The hole has been there since the world's first scream!

468
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:23,159
And now it's gonna come for us!

469
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,966
The darkness is gonna come for all of us!

470
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,400
It's coming for you!

471
00:43:27,924 --> 00:43:28,924
Hey!

472
00:43:29,903 --> 00:43:32,223
And it's gonna kill you.

473
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:35,160
Okay.
- It's coming for all of us!

474
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,600
ALL OF US !

475
00:43:42,812 --> 00:43:45,092
It's coming for me.

476
00:44:07,654 --> 00:44:09,454
The darkness will come?

477
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,113
What's that about?

478
00:44:11,114 --> 00:44:12,114
I don't know.

479
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,200
I wish we hadn't talk to him.

480
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,600
What you guys do today?

481
00:44:32,005 --> 00:44:33,565
Just hung out.

482
00:44:33,906 --> 00:44:36,082
Yeah! Did you have fun?

483
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:42,043
Well! It doesn't seem like I'm the 
only one who's gonna be doing the talking this evening.

484
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,436
What do you two feel about having the house to yourselves?
For a day or two?

485
00:44:46,437 --> 00:44:48,200
Bad...

486
00:44:48,334 --> 00:44:49,334
Well! 

487
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:54,240
I've got an offer to go and do some training
in hospital thats out of town.

488
00:44:55,410 --> 00:44:57,517
You know. So that I can get certified 
so I can make some more money.

489
00:44:57,518 --> 00:44:59,164
You got enough money.

490
00:44:59,165 --> 00:45:01,529
Yeah! Not the way you've been eating lately sweetie.

491
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,920
Is a... that doctor going?

492
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,998
Yes, he will be there I believe.

493
00:45:07,999 --> 00:45:08,999
We'll be fine.

494
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:10,985
You two can have lots of fun.

495
00:45:10,986 --> 00:45:13,270
There will be other people there from the hospital. Dane.

496
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,000
Right.
- Yes! right.

497
00:45:15,565 --> 00:45:19,560
- Why can't I come with you?
- Because we're trying answers for the staffs from the hospital.

498
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:22,440
Besides, I need someone here to keep 
an eye on the house for me.

499
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:23,740
Don't want to keep an eye on the home.

500
00:45:23,741 --> 00:45:24,741
Those are...

501
00:45:26,132 --> 00:45:27,132
Ouch...

502
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,673
What is wrong?
- Nothing

503
00:45:30,674 --> 00:45:32,181
We'll be fine. Have fun.

504
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,360
I can stay if you want me to Dane.

505
00:45:58,252 --> 00:46:02,523
I don't want you to stay.
- Yeah, and you don't want me to go either. So...

506
00:46:02,524 --> 00:46:04,200
What am I supposed to do?

507
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:07,280
I just don't get it.

508
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,760
After everythings that's happen and...

509
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:13,080
After what happened to Lucas,
it's just...

510
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:16,674
Not every man is your father.

511
00:46:17,675 --> 00:46:19,025
How do you know?

512
00:46:24,963 --> 00:46:27,403
Because you're not.

513
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,240
You're not an animal.

514
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:34,058
We can't be scared forever. Okay.

515
00:46:34,059 --> 00:46:35,706
I'm not scared.

516
00:47:23,754 --> 00:47:26,274
I'm not done!

517
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:29,800
Not yet!

518
00:47:32,177 --> 00:47:33,897
I'm not done!

519
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:13,452
What are you looking for?

520
00:48:13,453 --> 00:48:14,453
My sketchbook.

521
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:17,800
Maybe at Creepy Carl's.

522
00:48:19,411 --> 00:48:21,291
Stay here.

523
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,400
Hello?

524
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:11,720
He's really gone?

525
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,536
Are you sure?

526
00:49:14,837 --> 00:49:15,837
Yeah.

527
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:26,506
Maybe we should think of something else for a little while?

528
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,800
You can go swiming at my place.

529
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:57,480
C'mon get in Lucas.

530
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,160
Let's forget it for a little while.

531
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:06,200
This one kinda looks like a hand.

532
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,480
Whose hand?

533
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:12,064
C'mon, it's because you can. Boss.

534
00:50:12,065 --> 00:50:13,913
Try and get your brother.

535
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,800
The biggest splash wins!

536
00:50:25,354 --> 00:50:27,949
C'mon!
- Okay, okay.

537
00:50:27,950 --> 00:50:28,950
Cute.

538
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:32,000
Ready?

539
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:47,000
Did you see that?
- Nice splash, man!

540
00:50:47,618 --> 00:50:51,018
C'mon, Dane. This was supposed to help you 
separate yourself about the hole.

541
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:53,600
I'm not worried about it. I'm just trying to figure it out.

542
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:55,663
Stop looking at that and play.

543
00:50:55,664 --> 00:50:57,913
Or go home and jump in your hole.

544
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:03,440
Or you're scared you are going to lose.

545
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,120
Nice splash.

546
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:30,122
Who's just here?

547
00:51:30,123 --> 00:51:31,123
Nobody.

548
00:51:49,423 --> 00:51:51,630
They're probably just from my dad.

549
00:51:51,631 --> 00:51:52,631
Yeah.

550
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:23,480
Charlie.

551
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,680
You're killing me.

552
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,200
Lucas!

553
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:07,200
Yeah okay.

554
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,160
You alright?
- The clown's in there.

555
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:16,760
The puppet. In the pool. It grabbed me.

556
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:19,400
Tried to pull me into the hole.

557
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:23,120
Kid. It's just your foot. Your foot 
probably got stuck in the drain... - No!

558
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:26,349
It's in there. 

559
00:53:26,350 --> 00:53:28,297
It grabbed me.

560
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:31,920
It pulled me. Wouldn't let go.

561
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:45,400
- I'll take him home.
- I'm so sorry, Lucas.

562
00:54:05,654 --> 00:54:07,974
- Hello?
- Hey, how is he?

563
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:11,000
He's been asleep since he got here.

564
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,480
Anything I can do?

565
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:16,960
No! I think I'm just gonna... you know let him sleep.
Hang out here a little bit.

566
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,800
Call me if you need anything. Okay?

567
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:21,000
Alright, thanks. Bye.

568
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:29,080
State Prison - New Jersey

569
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:38,800
Hello Boy

570
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:17,360
Shhh... Someone's in the house.

571
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:35,360
Stay here.

572
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:44,280
Dane...

573
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:50,800
Dane.

574
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:03,680
Hey, son.
What's your name?

575
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:08,360
Lucas.
- You come go down here, Lucas?

576
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,588
Are you the one that called?

577
00:58:16,589 --> 00:58:18,684
My brother... I think.

578
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:21,695
He said somebody's in the house.

579
00:58:21,696 --> 00:58:23,657
Did your brother said who it was?

580
00:58:28,046 --> 00:58:31,934
I'm looking for this person. Right here.

581
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:37,800
That one there, on the right.

582
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:40,680
I don't want her to get hurt.

583
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:48,760
You think that's who your brother saw?

584
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:55,842
Hey! I thought I told you to stay here.

585
00:58:55,843 --> 00:58:56,839
He's down there.

586
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:59,400
What?
- He gave me this!

587
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:05,760
Where are you going?
- What do you think?

588
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:33,276
You said the nails will keep it closed.

589
00:59:33,277 --> 00:59:34,277
You said no one can come forward.

590
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:57,760
<i> Julie... </i>

591
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:07,120
<i> My head got broken. </i>

592
01:00:21,032 --> 01:00:22,440
Daddy?

593
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:25,153
<i> Don't let him hear you. </i>

594
01:00:25,154 --> 01:00:26,800
<i> He'll make us go to bed. </i>

595
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:29,520
<i> I want to stay up and play. </i>

596
01:00:33,574 --> 01:00:34,894
Julie.

597
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:43,760
<i> Save me, Julie. </i>

598
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:48,920
Julie.

599
01:00:53,602 --> 01:00:55,570
She can't be true, she can't be true, 

600
01:00:55,571 --> 01:00:56,571
she can't be true.

601
01:00:57,500 --> 01:01:00,572
She... She's dead.
She can't be true

602
01:01:00,573 --> 01:01:04,675
Who?
- Annie ... Annie Smith.

603
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:09,320
We used to be best friends.
We done everything together. And...

604
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:10,840
What happened?

605
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:14,880
I let her fall.

606
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:18,900
Julie!

607
01:01:18,901 --> 01:01:21,214
I know what I have to do now.

608
01:01:21,215 --> 01:01:23,640
Stay in the house!
- I don't want to stay in the house.

609
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:25,840
Just stay in the yard then.

610
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:50,000
Annie!

611
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:33,200
Julie!

612
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:36,400
Julie!

613
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:42,640
Julie, what are you doing?

614
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:07,400
Julie!

615
01:03:08,715 --> 01:03:10,635
Oh, my god...

616
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:51,040
<i> You got to be careful, Jul (Julie).  </i>

617
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:54,480
I know.

618
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:57,320
Sorry.

619
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:00,040
<i> That's okay. </i>

620
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:04,560
<i> Just a ride, just like before. </i>

621
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:07,560
You let me fall!

622
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:08,600
No!

623
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:11,760
Hang on!

624
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:20,440
Annie, hold on!

625
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:22,222
You should have saved me. 

626
01:04:22,223 --> 01:04:24,399
I know! I wanted to.

627
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:27,600
But you didn't. You just sat there crying!

628
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:31,360
Even when the policeman heard us, when he fell !

629
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:32,720
I tried.

630
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:34,424
I couldn't

631
01:04:34,425 --> 01:04:36,765
You let me die!

632
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:40,440
I was scared.
Was so scared.

633
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:44,306
No more scared anymore?

634
01:04:44,307 --> 01:04:45,307
No.

635
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:47,960
Not anymore.

636
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:51,560
That's good.

637
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,400
Julie!

638
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:58,320
<i> Bye, Julie. </i>

639
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:33,040
Lucas.

640
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:35,520
Dane?

641
01:05:37,181 --> 01:05:38,501
Where are you?

642
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:40,360
In the basement. C'mon!

643
01:05:58,529 --> 01:05:59,569
Dane?

644
01:05:59,738 --> 01:06:01,218
I'm over here.

645
01:06:26,658 --> 01:06:29,298
I was looking for you.

646
01:07:21,946 --> 01:07:23,986
You want a piece of me?

647
01:07:31,538 --> 01:07:33,138
Stop it!

648
01:07:54,802 --> 01:07:56,602
Strike one!

649
01:08:32,638 --> 01:08:34,600
I really don't like clowns.

650
01:08:36,100 --> 01:08:38,489
I think it likes whatever you're afraid of.

651
01:08:38,490 --> 01:08:39,490
What?

652
01:08:40,082 --> 01:08:43,122
It's like you look in the hole,
and it knows you somehow.

653
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:45,310
It brings your fears to life.

654
01:08:45,311 --> 01:08:46,311
It's like...

655
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:47,760
I don't know? For Lucas it's the clowns,

656
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:50,157
And with you is what happened to 
Annie and the cop.

657
01:08:50,158 --> 01:08:51,240
What about you?

658
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,640
Oh I... I told you guys I'm not afraid of anything.

659
01:08:55,243 --> 01:08:56,732
But, I mean c'mon! He dies anyway right?

660
01:08:56,733 --> 01:08:57,733
Nope!

661
01:08:57,641 --> 01:09:00,000
But I still don't want to stay here tonight.

662
01:09:00,350 --> 01:09:03,690
You guys can stay at my place. 
My parents don't mind.

663
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:05,080
Yes!

664
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:07,160
Let me get my stuff okay?

665
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:11,720
Creepy Carl was always talking about the darkness.

666
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:13,600
Maybe it came and got him?

667
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:18,685
Why do you have these drawings all over the floor?

668
01:09:18,686 --> 01:09:20,358
It's a kind of puzzle.

669
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:24,560
I thought this would like... show me more!
But, I can't figure it out.

670
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:29,578
Cause this... I thought right there. But then...

671
01:09:29,579 --> 01:09:30,579
I don't know.

672
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:36,960
What about down here?

673
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:39,760
Yeah! yeah, that works.

674
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:47,440
Like... like that I think?

675
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:08,920
I'll try.

676
01:10:14,187 --> 01:10:15,331
Oh... oh yeah yeah.

677
01:10:21,290 --> 01:10:22,770
Right...

678
01:10:58,755 --> 01:11:00,355
It looks like a...

679
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:05,359
very large man dragging a boy...

680
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:06,360
Lucas!

681
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:08,880
Lucas!

682
01:11:13,365 --> 01:11:14,965
Lucas!

683
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:16,373
What's the matter? Where's Lucas?

684
01:11:16,374 --> 01:11:17,747
My father's got him.

685
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,160
What?

686
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:21,320
Lucas!

687
01:11:22,314 --> 01:11:23,771
Dane? What's going on?

688
01:11:23,772 --> 01:11:24,772
It's all my fault.

689
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:26,480
He took Lucas down there.
I have to go get him.

690
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:29,200
What?
There is no down there!

691
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:31,280
There's no bottom. Remember?

692
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:33,160
Well! There's something.

693
01:11:34,743 --> 01:11:37,196
I thought you said you didn't have a father?

694
01:11:37,197 --> 01:11:40,709
I don't! I've got some jerk locked up in the Jersey Prison.

695
01:11:40,710 --> 01:11:43,560
Because he likes to get drunk every nite.
and beat the crap outta us.

696
01:11:44,316 --> 01:11:46,600
He's been in there since Lucas was little, so ...

697
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:50,090
All we know is that everytime we 
get a letter from prison then...

698
01:11:50,091 --> 01:11:52,600
it means we're moving again. Cos he found us.

699
01:11:53,321 --> 01:11:56,600
I don't understand... He's in jail then 
how can he be here?

700
01:11:58,040 --> 01:12:01,080
Guess we know now,
what I'm afraid of, don't we?

701
01:12:04,974 --> 01:12:06,654
Dane!

702
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,680
Dane!

703
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:57,920
Dane!

704
01:12:58,560 --> 01:12:59,356
Lucas!

705
01:13:00,456 --> 01:13:03,417
<i> Dane! He's right behind you! </i>

706
01:13:05,353 --> 01:13:06,925
<i> He's right behind you! </i>

707
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:22,720
<i> some jerk locked up in the Jersey Prison. </i>

708
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:26,320
<i> Not every man is like your father.</i>

709
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:28,802
<i> I've got some jerk locked up... </i>

710
01:14:28,803 --> 01:14:30,845
The boy is asking for it.

711
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:35,600
<i> I know it's just...  his father was not a nice guy. </i>

712
01:14:37,314 --> 01:14:40,096
<i> We got married too young... he's in jail how can he be here... </i>

713
01:14:40,097 --> 01:14:42,200
<i> Been in there since Lucas was small, so... </i>

714
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:49,240
<i> His father was not a good man... 
Cause he likes to get drunk... </i>

715
01:15:14,444 --> 01:15:15,964
Lucas...

716
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:34,880
Lucas...

717
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:56,555
How did you know I was in here?

718
01:15:56,556 --> 01:15:59,022
That's where I used to hide when I get scared.

719
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:03,960
Thought you said you weren't scared of anything.

720
01:16:04,730 --> 01:16:06,890
I lied.

721
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:14,491
In the end... You shouldn't have come.

722
01:16:14,492 --> 01:16:15,492
Why?

723
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:17,800
Because that's what he wanted.

724
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:21,960
Said he only took me to get you down here.

725
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:33,960
Where are you, kids?

726
01:16:46,811 --> 01:16:49,211
I think Creepy Carl was right.

727
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:51,680
It is gonna kill us.
- Look at me.

728
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:55,080
There's no way I'm gonna let that happen, okay?

729
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:58,000
Okay...

730
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:02,160
You been asking for it!

731
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:06,200
I'll teach you a lesson you won't forget!

732
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:08,360
Leave us alone!

733
01:17:15,182 --> 01:17:16,542
Dane.

734
01:17:31,675 --> 01:17:33,340
Go! Climb!
- What are you doing?

735
01:17:33,341 --> 01:17:34,341
Go as highest as you can!

736
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:35,760
What?
- Go!

737
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:19,440
Welcome home, boy.

738
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:25,160
I knew I'd find you hiding in the same closet.

739
01:18:30,548 --> 01:18:33,520
Just like back when you let your 
brother take the beating for you.

740
01:18:35,180 --> 01:18:36,660
That's not true.

741
01:18:37,259 --> 01:18:38,979
Remember his arm?

742
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:42,600
You can hear it crack from inside there.

743
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:45,960
I didn't know what you were gonna do?
I didn't think you would hurt him?

744
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:49,080
Sure, you did.
You're just scared!

745
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:51,600
I'm not scared of you.

746
01:18:57,080 --> 01:18:59,560
You'd be here if that was true.

747
01:19:00,918 --> 01:19:02,863
You're gonna be afraid your whole life.

748
01:19:02,864 --> 01:19:03,864
Not anymore...

749
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:08,360
You can't hurt me.

750
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:21,640
Tell me boy. Did that hurt?

751
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:51,560
I know that you're not that big.

752
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:56,520
You just looked like it cause I was little.

753
01:19:57,080 --> 01:19:59,520
That's why you came after us. 
it's because you're mean.

754
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:03,000
You're just scared. You scared of everyone else.
Weren't you?

755
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:12,000
Do I look scared to you?

756
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:14,880
Do I?

757
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:28,960
Your fears are falling away, boy.
What happens to you when they're gone?

758
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:30,680
Let's find out.

759
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:35,160
There you go.

760
01:20:35,898 --> 01:20:37,440
Like father, like son.

761
01:21:00,366 --> 01:21:02,960
I am nothing like you.

762
01:21:32,280 --> 01:21:33,480
Dane!

763
01:21:41,883 --> 01:21:43,739
Nice climbing, buddy.

764
01:21:43,740 --> 01:21:44,740
Thanks.

765
01:21:46,125 --> 01:21:47,240
You okay?

766
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:50,972
Oh! He's gone now. Don't have to worry about it.

767
01:21:50,973 --> 01:21:51,973
Yeah... cool!

768
01:21:53,187 --> 01:21:54,720
Oh! Who's gone?

769
01:21:57,880 --> 01:21:59,809
Nobody! Just screwing around.

770
01:21:59,810 --> 01:22:00,810
Yeah?

771
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:03,219
What is this?

772
01:22:03,220 --> 01:22:04,220
Oh! It's just a hole.

773
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:06,960
Just a hole?
- No! Wait!

774
01:22:09,080 --> 01:22:10,760
What is this?

775
01:22:15,043 --> 01:22:15,847
It a...

776
01:22:16,878 --> 01:22:18,974
Just crawlspace you know.

777
01:22:18,975 --> 01:22:20,079
That ought to...

778
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:21,240
keep the little kids out.

779
01:22:21,240 --> 01:22:24,560
Yeah! Just keep that closed. It's not very safe.

780
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:27,800
Alright! Hey you! What are you 
guys gonna do now? Huh?

781
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:31,163
Well... You know... We're playing a little

782
01:22:31,164 --> 01:22:32,525
midnight basketball.

783
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:36,000
but I think Lucas is too scared of the 
whoopdown I'm gonna give em.

784
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:39,065
Oh! That sounds like a challenge to me!

785
01:22:39,066 --> 01:22:41,289
Yeah...! Zip it!
- Alright!

786
01:22:41,290 --> 01:22:44,480
Why not make it two on two there huh?
You, me and boys against girls!

787
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:48,360
Definitely!
- Alright! C'mon! Let's do this thing!

788
01:22:49,591 --> 01:22:53,511
Mom! Do you have any fears? 
Like scariest thing you can think of...

789
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:57,760
Like dinosaurs, spiders or an alien egg?

790
01:22:58,280 --> 01:23:00,864
Well, those are pretty scary but em...

791
01:23:00,865 --> 01:23:03,079
You know I've got to say when I was a little girl...

792
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:06,385
I was pretty scared about monsters that 
I thought was under my bed.

793
01:23:07,153 --> 01:23:08,153
Oh o...

794
01:23:09,153 --> 01:23:19,153
