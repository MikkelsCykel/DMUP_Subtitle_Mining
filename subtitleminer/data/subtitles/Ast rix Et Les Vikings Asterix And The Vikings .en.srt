00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,181
Far Far to the North lies an unforgiving land

2
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:43,841
where the nights last several
moons and the winters are cruel

3
00:00:47,919 --> 00:00:51,420
This is the land of the vikings

4
00:00:52,599 --> 00:00:57,580
Here fierce chieftains lead their warriors
to battle

5
00:01:09,279 --> 00:01:11,380
Charge

6
00:01:31,277 --> 00:01:33,218
Hello?

7
00:01:34,157 --> 00:01:36,318
Anybody Home?

8
00:01:37,957 --> 00:01:43,678
By Thor

9
00:01:51,276 --> 00:01:56,157
It's always the same.we raid and nobody
is there

10
00:01:57,516 --> 00:01:59,657
Are the gods angry with us?

11
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:09,437
Here the words of the gods

12
00:02:09,937 --> 00:02:13,737
Half a loaf of bread is better than none

13
00:02:13,837 --> 00:02:17,238
-The early bird gets the worm

14
00:02:18,755 --> 00:02:21,835
Kryptograf,make yourself useful for once

15
00:02:21,935 --> 00:02:23,676
-Odin sa....Ah

16
00:02:24,095 --> 00:02:27,316
How do our enemys vanish without a trace

17
00:02:27,655 --> 00:02:29,596
Odin says that

18
00:02:29,696 --> 00:02:32,597
fear lends them wings

19
00:02:33,974 --> 00:02:36,194
What did you just say, Kryptograf?

20
00:02:36,294 --> 00:02:39,954
This thing called "fear" gives
them the power to fly?

21
00:02:40,054 --> 00:02:45,855
No,it was just a figure of speech, th..
-Imagine if we could fly

22
00:02:49,994 --> 00:02:53,210
Excuse me, i thing you have misinterpreted what i ..

23
00:02:53,314 --> 00:02:57,974
we need to find the champion of fear,
who will teach us this magic art

24
00:02:58,074 --> 00:03:02,673
with fear giving us wings nothing
will stand in our way

25
00:03:02,773 --> 00:03:06,873
Soon we can boast to the world ,
Vikings doall about fear

26
00:03:06,973 --> 00:03:11,734
We are the most chicken hearted,
jelly belly cowards of all

27
00:03:11,834 --> 00:03:14,434
Cowards,cowards ...

28
00:03:14,534 --> 00:03:16,434
Cowards, cowards ...

29
00:03:16,632 --> 00:03:21,993
I will give anything to whoever
brings me that champion.

30
00:03:24,972 --> 00:03:28,293
Anything?

31
00:03:29,192 --> 00:03:32,173
Kryptograf,can you do it?

32
00:03:34,072 --> 00:03:37,692
Odin says that the champion of fear is..

33
00:03:39,891 --> 00:03:41,932
located right..

34
00:03:42,032 --> 00:03:43,733
right ..

35
00:03:44,191 --> 00:03:46,512
Right there

36
00:03:49,371 --> 00:03:54,832
ASTERIX AND THE VIKINGS

37
00:03:55,691 --> 00:03:58,292
But where has the finger of fate pointed?

38
00:03:58,511 --> 00:04:04,131
A village of sted fast Gauls ,
the last hold-out against the Roman Empire

39
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:08,851
sharing mutual respect ,
harmony and understanding

40
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:16,951
-Hey Obelix.
-So.. Asterix..

41
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:19,371
..anything exciting happening today?

42
00:04:19,471 --> 00:04:23,170
-No not really
-Hey ,any trouble from the Romans?

43
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,171
-No , i'm afraid not

44
00:04:26,429 --> 00:04:30,050
-You say my fishes roten?
-It;s more than roten, it's a health hazard

45
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:33,610
-I feel like something is missing around here
-I don't know what

46
00:04:33,611 --> 00:04:35,611
-Maybe a good fish fight

47
00:04:37,809 --> 00:04:40,870
-Actually i think there is a fish
fight going on right now

48
00:04:41,171 --> 00:04:42,270
There is?

49
00:04:42,948 --> 00:04:45,989
-Want to join in?
-I suppose so..

50
00:04:46,089 --> 00:04:50,590
-But Obelix no stones ok?
-Well at least they are fresh

51
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,489
Stop the fight

52
00:04:52,589 --> 00:04:56,049
-stop i say.
Stop it

53
00:04:56,748 --> 00:05:02,389
I hold in my hand a letter from
my brother Doublehelix

54
00:05:02,528 --> 00:05:07,688
the renouned warrior, the famous
hero of the battle of Gagovia

55
00:05:07,788 --> 00:05:12,848
who fought side by side with
the great Vercingetorix.

56
00:05:12,967 --> 00:05:14,888
But what's the news?

57
00:05:15,487 --> 00:05:21,348
A..Oh yes. He is sending his
son Justforkix here from Parisium

58
00:05:21,607 --> 00:05:25,247
Now ..you are my two finest warriors

59
00:05:25,347 --> 00:05:30,006
I'm giving you the job of
training Justforkix to be a man

60
00:05:30,106 --> 00:05:33,847
We will make him the greatest
warrior Gaul has ever seen

61
00:05:33,947 --> 00:05:38,207
We must prepare a grand feast in his honor

62
00:05:38,307 --> 00:05:41,458
Allright people you know what to do

63
00:06:03,785 --> 00:06:06,226

This is Justforkix ,son of my
brother Doublehelix

These are my finest warriors
Asterix and Obelix

00:06:30,674 --> 00:06:33,174
They will be in charge of your training

71
00:06:33,274 --> 00:06:35,274

-This fishes aren't very fresh

78
00:07:10,322 --> 00:07:15,282

Don't force him, he will turn them off

00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,601
Asterix look at him

89
00:08:03,701 --> 00:08:09,127
If we want to make a warrior out of
him we've got to get him to eat

90
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:19,919
Ah..man this really is the sticks

00:12:18,197 --> 00:12:21,078
Being a girl sucks

Justforkix

127
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:05,857
It's time to start training to

Great progress?

140
00:16:06,707 --> 00:16:10,646
I gave you a mission to make
a man of him

141
00:16:10,746 --> 00:16:13,267
Nobody asked me if i wanted to be
a man

142
00:16:13,367 --> 00:16:16,307
That's enough..you'll carry on

143
00:16:16,407 --> 00:16:21,187
And you two had better find
something he likes to do

144
00:16:23,766 --> 00:16:27,327
Ah..it's ready

145

151
00:17:07,755 --> 00:17:12,254
You don't have hair on your chest..
Come to think of it..Neither do I

152
00:17:12,354 --> 00:17:14,614

You know.. i don't know you
-Yeah

158
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:08,851
Abba,what are you doing here?
I said you can't come

159
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:16,812
I am not staying at home any more..

160
00:18:17,031 --> 00:18:19,650
Do you think its right to treat
women like slaves?

161
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,070
Yeah..

162
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:25,771
One day we are going to be equal to men..
-Yeah..

163
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:29,611
Are you finished?
No i am not finished..

164
00:18:29,711 --> 00:18:32,770
Women want to fly too.
We want to learn fear..

165
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:37,331
We can be just as scared as men

166
00:18:39,849 --> 00:18:44,810
Who is this new guy.
-That's my daughter cod-brain

167
00:18:45,809 --> 00:18:48,570
Your daughter is a man?

168
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:51,090
Land ahead

169
00:18:51,729 --> 00:18:55,750
Al right men.Everybody back at their seats
and fasting your seat belts

170
00:18:55,851 --> 00:18:57,851
We are getting ready for landing

171
00:19:14,948 --> 00:19:18,929
Guys..I am really not sure about this..

172
00:19:19,049 --> 00:19:22,654
Just relax.It will be fan.
You know..everybody is going..

173
00:19:28,907 --> 00:19:33,488
Is this where the party is?
-You can say that..

174
00:19:36,407 --> 00:19:39,848
Long live Pax Romana

175
00:19:45,086 --> 00:19:47,247
What is that?

176
00:19:47,347 --> 00:19:50,207
Caesar for ever

177
00:19:50,706 --> 00:19:53,247
That's Oliaginus.He is new around here..

178
00:19:53,347 --> 00:19:56,647
Can i take this one?
No..leave him to the kid..

179
00:19:56,747 --> 00:19:59,887
Yes asterix leave him to the kid..

180
00:19:59,987 --> 00:20:03,647
All right all right take it easy

181
00:20:05,305 --> 00:20:08,526
Would your highness care to
do the honours?

182
00:20:08,626 --> 00:20:10,726
On three..
-Are you crazy?

183
00:20:10,845 --> 00:20:12,506
One..
-I am a pacifist

184
00:20:12,606 --> 00:20:14,307
Two..
-I am not going to fight anyone

185
00:20:14,407 --> 00:20:16,308
Three

186
00:20:16,865 --> 00:20:19,301
Yeah..you did it first
one down

187
00:20:32,344 --> 00:20:35,365
They are animals

188
00:20:49,603 --> 00:20:54,524
Let me out of here.
-Second door on the right past the tent

189
00:20:54,703 --> 00:20:57,144
Thank you

190
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:03,949
Hey the kid is getting into it
-I knew he would like it

191
00:21:13,482 --> 00:21:17,743
Crazy..they are all crazy

192
00:21:28,082 --> 00:21:30,502
Vikings..Aahh

193
00:21:35,841 --> 00:21:39,342
At last my fist raid, i can't wait

194
00:21:39,442 --> 00:21:44,462
Don't even think about it,you
are staying on board until we are back home

195
00:21:44,581 --> 00:21:46,862
What?You can't do that..

196
00:21:46,962 --> 00:21:48,421
Yes i can

197
00:21:48,422 --> 00:21:50,202
I want stay, you can't make me

198
00:21:50,302 --> 00:21:52,761
Yes i can

199
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,181
Yeah..
-Oh Yeah?

200
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,601
Yeah

201
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:05,301
All right men.You know why we are here

202
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:10,761
but there is going to be no killing and
plundering this time

203
00:22:10,861 --> 00:22:16,169
Rather than slaughter them we
must observe them and get what we came for

204
00:22:16,269 --> 00:22:21,520
Find the champion.
Then we can slaughter them.

205
00:22:26,939 --> 00:22:30,240
Olaf.Over here..

206
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:34,040
You are sure you got the plan
-Yeah..

207
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:38,959
No..I am sorry dad,but it's a very
complicated plan

208
00:22:40,218 --> 00:22:43,518
Sit down and i'll try again

209
00:22:43,618 --> 00:22:46,739
Here..this is you.
-I am a rock

210
00:22:46,858 --> 00:22:49,098
Just pretend this is you
-OK

211
00:22:49,198 --> 00:22:52,979
Now..here is the champion of fear
see how he is shaking and trembling

212
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:56,079
Now if you capture the champion
of fear like this

213
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,279
then you can ask chiftain
Olaf for anything you want

214
00:23:00,237 --> 00:23:01,718
Ah..

215
00:23:01,858 --> 00:23:07,359
What do i want?
-Ah..the chiefs daughter..Abba

216
00:23:07,497 --> 00:23:09,878
Looks like a rock

217
00:23:09,978 --> 00:23:13,987
There..it's a girl.
What am i supposed to do with her?

218
00:23:14,087 --> 00:23:18,157
Marry her.
-Why?she took my hair

219
00:23:18,356 --> 00:23:20,217
Because the chief doesn't have a son

220
00:23:20,317 --> 00:23:23,536
whick means his son in law
is next in line to be chief

221
00:23:23,636 --> 00:23:27,837
Do you understand the plan now?

222
00:23:28,416 --> 00:23:30,877
Yeah..

223
00:23:31,036 --> 00:23:33,057
I am a rock

224
00:23:43,715 --> 00:23:46,235
Well i think that went rather well

225
00:23:46,335 --> 00:23:51,215
Yeah ..i thinkit was good for the kid
anyway .He was really enjoying himself

226
00:23:51,315 --> 00:23:54,096
Obelix,Asterix  Help,they are coming..

227
00:23:54,215 --> 00:23:58,095
Ah,there is our boy
-Yeah look at him run

228
00:23:58,195 --> 00:24:02,135
They are landing.The Vikings
are landing on the beach

229
00:24:02,235 --> 00:24:04,814
We have to tell the others
because it's too late

230
00:24:04,914 --> 00:24:07,674
Take it easy.One invader at a time

231
00:24:07,774 --> 00:24:11,855
That's right ,they have to take their time,
we were fas..

232
00:24:12,274 --> 00:24:15,295
We have to go..what are you waiting for?

233
00:24:15,434 --> 00:24:19,135
What?you wanna go now?
Aren't you listening to me?

234
00:24:19,235 --> 00:24:21,755
Don't you know who the Vikings are?

235
00:24:21,855 --> 00:24:26,403
Sure,the ruthless savage warriors
who destroy everything in their path.

236
00:24:26,503 --> 00:24:32,854
Just because we are provential doesn't
mean we aren't with it..

237
00:24:52,252 --> 00:24:57,152
Maybe we should talk to him.
-Yeah.You know what i think he is hungry.

238
00:24:57,252 --> 00:25:02,288
I'll go get a boar.        -No i think
it would be better if you talk to him

239
00:25:10,931 --> 00:25:15,652
All right listen,you mustn't get scared
we are here for you

240
00:25:15,771 --> 00:25:19,832
Remember we are Gauls,we don't
know the meaning of fear right?

241
00:25:19,932 --> 00:25:26,611
Well..i do.I am an expert.
I am afraid of everything

242
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:31,091
I am like ..the champion of fear

243
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,326
There there, look at you a big tough warrior

244
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:38,311
you aren't frightened now, are you?

245
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:43,251
I guess not.It's not so bad now,
as long you are here

246
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:46,270
Spoil sports.
We've better get going

247
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:49,509
We don't want to miss launch
Yeah,we will continue the training tomorrow

248
00:25:49,609 --> 00:25:54,050
You will see.You can easily
become a warrior.No problem

249
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:57,070
No.It's hopeless

250
00:26:00,209 --> 00:26:05,550
What?You saw the champion?
and he knows the meaning of fear?

251
00:26:05,669 --> 00:26:09,110
Yeah he does.I observed him

252
00:26:09,209 --> 00:26:12,910
But when he is with those stupid Gauls
he starts to forget it

253
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:15,611
He is not too bright. You idiot..

254
00:26:15,711 --> 00:26:18,588
You looked at the right man and didn't grab him?

255
00:26:18,688 --> 00:26:20,449
You think  you had to
take notes?

256
00:26:20,549 --> 00:26:25,390
Rescue the champion before these
Barbarians drain the fear out of him

257
00:26:36,207 --> 00:26:39,308
Justforkix i have been trying out some
of those dance steps

258
00:26:39,309 --> 00:26:41,209
You know..the one's you showed me

259
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:45,588
And i am not sure i got it right..

260
00:26:48,987 --> 00:26:51,577
Well you are right about one thing..
you don't got it right, look..

261
00:26:51,677 --> 00:26:54,726
Your left foot goes behind your right,
like this

262
00:26:54,826 --> 00:26:58,527
Oh yeah,yeah it's better
-Yeah,much better

263
00:26:58,686 --> 00:27:02,706
Repeat that a few times after i am gone,
and you'll rule the dance floor in no time

264
00:27:02,806 --> 00:27:07,107
Gone?Justforkix are you leaving us?

265
00:27:08,286 --> 00:27:10,787
Yeah

266
00:27:11,306 --> 00:27:15,826
Hey Justforkix ,hold on a second

267
00:27:18,785 --> 00:27:23,765
Here kid,i've got something for you,
this is my finest stone

268
00:27:23,865 --> 00:27:26,746
I was planning to give it to you as
a graduation present

269
00:27:26,747 --> 00:27:27,747
You know,when you became a warrior

270
00:27:28,646 --> 00:27:32,606
But you can have it now. You can keep on
training with it back home if you want

271
00:27:32,706 --> 00:27:36,645
If you try to lift it every day, i am sure
you will make it

272
00:27:36,745 --> 00:27:40,546
I don't think so..it's impossible

273
00:27:40,664 --> 00:27:45,115
How can you know it's impossible if
you don't try?

274
00:27:50,764 --> 00:27:53,725
What are you doing? You are
encouraging him to leave

275
00:27:53,825 --> 00:27:57,324
It's his own decision to make.
No it isn't,No it isn't

276
00:27:57,424 --> 00:28:01,164
What about our promise to Majestix?
What about the honor of our village?

277
00:28:01,264 --> 00:28:05,910
We can't force him.It isn't right.
-Well it's not right to..

278
00:28:10,803 --> 00:28:14,104
Yeah..faster..

279
00:28:29,022 --> 00:28:32,983
Oh look at that..the axle is shot

280
00:28:33,532 --> 00:28:34,933
Stupid stone

281
00:28:35,132 --> 00:28:39,388
This is great, it just keeps
getting better and better

282
00:28:43,361 --> 00:28:45,262
Who is there?

283
00:28:45,401 --> 00:28:47,302
Hello?

284
00:28:49,241 --> 00:28:53,062
Obelix?Asterix?
Is that you?

285
00:28:54,341 --> 00:28:55,421
Hello?

286
00:28:55,422 --> 00:28:57,423
Oh,it's just the wind

287
00:28:58,481 --> 00:29:05,381
The wind and some squirrels,
tiny winny harmless squirrels

288
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,721
and a Viking

289
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,980
Well he doesn't want to be here,
and we don't want him here

290
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,601
I guess it's better this way

291
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:24,660
Ah..I feel pretty good about it.
Don't you Obelix?

292
00:29:24,879 --> 00:29:27,180
I guess so..

293
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:29,940
Oh boy ,i am getting hungry

294
00:29:30,279 --> 00:29:33,740
Oh..I sure could use a couple of boars,
what do you say?

295
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,280
I am not hungry.
You are not?Come on..

296
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:40,700
A couple of nice juicy boars..

297
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:45,500
You know,he never even got
to taste that wild boar

298
00:29:49,138 --> 00:29:52,219
I guess we didn't make him feel all that
welcome if you think about it

299
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:56,220
He was really improving too,with just
a little bit more training

300
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:00,221
I could have made a real warrior out of him

301
00:30:01,918 --> 00:30:05,438
It's going to be really quiet around
here now

302
00:30:06,617 --> 00:30:09,978
SMS?wha..what?wait..

303
00:30:10,078 --> 00:30:11,979
what's happening?

304
00:30:23,477 --> 00:30:27,116
Justforkix had an accident

305
00:30:27,216 --> 00:30:30,317
Ah this foreign charrioted junk.

306
00:30:30,436 --> 00:30:33,837
You are putting
a tiny little stone and they bust

307
00:30:34,036 --> 00:30:37,617
Strange though that he went of into the
forest on his own

308
00:30:37,717 --> 00:30:42,377
Even stranger ,he left my present behind

309
00:30:43,496 --> 00:30:46,817
Obelix,look

310
00:30:56,175 --> 00:30:58,116
Justforkix's sword

311
00:30:58,415 --> 00:31:01,816
He's been kidnapped by the Vikings

312
00:31:01,935 --> 00:31:03,836
Oh no..

313
00:31:04,555 --> 00:31:07,336
We have to tell the chief

314
00:31:11,314 --> 00:31:15,615
Asterix,Obelix ,guess who has dropped by

315
00:31:15,715 --> 00:31:17,716
my brother Doublehelix

316
00:31:17,974 --> 00:31:22,795
the renouned warrior,the famous hero
of the battle of Gregovia

317
00:31:22,994 --> 00:31:27,615
Don;t forget the battle of
Parisium. HAHAHA

318
00:31:30,194 --> 00:31:34,114
Well i only have a few minutes before i
have to go of to Parisium

319
00:31:34,214 --> 00:31:37,314
so i'll just drop by and say hello to
Justforkix and..

320
00:31:37,414 --> 00:31:39,815
No..you can't see him

321
00:31:39,915 --> 00:31:44,116
It's impossible.
-He is far far away

322
00:31:44,373 --> 00:31:49,954
On a field trip. It's a training program.
lot of training in the programm

323
00:31:52,652 --> 00:31:55,733
Are we talking about the same kid?

324
00:31:56,872 --> 00:31:58,332
That's a good one

325
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:00,773
I'll return at the next full moon

326
00:32:00,873 --> 00:32:04,573
He'll be back from his field trip by then.
I suppose..

327
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:06,874
See you men later..

328
00:32:13,032 --> 00:32:15,232
The Vikings?

329
00:32:20,311 --> 00:32:22,752
I make a sallom vow

330
00:32:22,852 --> 00:32:25,312
I shall go to the land of the Vikings

331
00:32:25,313 --> 00:32:28,113
and bring back Justforkix before
the next full moon

332
00:32:28,731 --> 00:32:31,472
Me too.
-That's good

333
00:32:31,572 --> 00:32:35,971
My nephew's life and the honor
of the village are in your hands

334
00:32:36,071 --> 00:32:38,330
Don't worry, we'll get him
back in time

335
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:43,450
Asterix,take this potion with you
for the dangers ahead

336
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:47,171
Go North, until you hit the
first intersection of land

337
00:32:47,271 --> 00:32:48,390
Turn left
-Left

338
00:32:48,391 --> 00:32:50,930
Then to the right, and go straight into
the next shore

339
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:53,211
Then turn left. - Left
and go right after that..

340
00:32:53,311 --> 00:32:57,730
Then you want to..
Hey..what was that?

341
00:32:57,949 --> 00:33:03,119
Just follow the North Star
Right.Got you.North star.Ok

342
00:33:03,219 --> 00:33:07,750
Wait..wait ,before going on
your epic journey

343
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:11,409
you can't leave without a farewell ballad

344
00:33:11,509 --> 00:33:15,570
No..No..
-But i insist

345
00:33:19,868 --> 00:33:23,289
Farewell..
-Lok be with you

346
00:33:23,389 --> 00:33:27,409
What's all that?
Ahm..survival rations

347
00:33:41,907 --> 00:33:45,168
He doesn't look too smashed up

348
00:33:47,727 --> 00:33:52,248
Mercy!
-Mercy?what's that?

349
00:33:54,187 --> 00:33:58,368
Must be another one of their
strange inventions

350
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:08,027
He is good

351
00:34:13,786 --> 00:34:17,747
Tie him up.
I don't want him flying away

352
00:34:17,986 --> 00:34:20,287
NOOO...

353
00:34:31,425 --> 00:34:34,366
I'm hungryy..

354
00:34:34,785 --> 00:34:39,685
Yeah..well ,maybe you shouldn't have eaten
all the survival rations on the first day

355
00:34:39,785 --> 00:34:43,965
I can't help it,
when i am worried i eat

356
00:34:44,065 --> 00:34:46,925
How much further is it?
-I don't know Obelix

357
00:34:47,025 --> 00:34:51,205
The fog is hiding the sky,
i don't know where the North Star is

358
00:34:51,305 --> 00:34:54,326
Anything else for that matter

359
00:35:07,303 --> 00:35:09,284
SMS

360
00:35:09,623 --> 00:35:14,823
I thought i have lost you.
We'll get out of this right?

361
00:35:14,923 --> 00:35:17,924
Hey..cool bird,
It's yours right?

362
00:35:18,123 --> 00:35:21,984
Yeap,sure it's mine allright.
-Are you the champion?

363
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:24,673
My name is Justforkix. Who are you?

364
00:35:24,773 --> 00:35:28,403
Oh,yes.I am sorry.
I am Abba

365
00:35:28,602 --> 00:35:31,243
Would..would you help me?

366
00:35:31,682 --> 00:35:36,363
Yeah if i can..
-Ok

367
00:35:42,042 --> 00:35:45,423
Yeah..thanks..that's nice

368
00:35:47,162 --> 00:35:52,502
You are cold?
-No not cold..

369
00:35:53,341 --> 00:35:54,822
Afraid..

370
00:35:54,922 --> 00:35:58,142
You are so lucky..
-Lucky?

371
00:35:58,242 --> 00:36:00,642
To be able to fly..
-Fly?

372
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:03,082
I'd love to glide over the sea like a bird

373
00:36:03,182 --> 00:36:07,462
and rise higher and higher
right up to the sun

374
00:36:07,562 --> 00:36:11,581
Will you teach me?Please teach me..

375
00:36:11,681 --> 00:36:13,922
Tell me your secret

376
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:17,701
Well..if you help me get
back home i'll give it a try..

377
00:36:17,801 --> 00:36:22,361
What are you doing?I told you 100
times not to talk to strangers

378
00:36:22,461 --> 00:36:26,081
Sorry..
-Not you!!

379
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:32,210
Dad..thanks for embarrasing me
in front of the hostage

380
00:36:46,899 --> 00:36:51,360
I'm still hungry!!
-No kidding!

381
00:36:51,779 --> 00:36:55,898
Asterix?Do you really think the North Star
is still up there?

382
00:36:55,998 --> 00:37:01,178
Above the fog i mean..
-Ha ha..unless you ate it yes..

383
00:37:01,278 --> 00:37:05,219
Obelix,you just gave me an Idea

384
00:37:11,198 --> 00:37:14,478
Did you see it?
-No try again

385
00:37:18,237 --> 00:37:21,238
That way Obelix..

386
00:37:54,416 --> 00:37:57,536
So when are you going to talk to
your father about setting me free

387
00:37:57,636 --> 00:37:59,437
As soon as you teach me to fly..

388
00:37:59,537 --> 00:38:02,116
Oh yeah..That..

389
00:38:02,295 --> 00:38:05,276
I was just wondering..

390
00:38:05,455 --> 00:38:10,236
What's your attitude about people
who promise something..and..and..

391
00:38:10,237 --> 00:38:11,237
..then..

392
00:38:10,395 --> 00:38:13,456
can't deliver all it..

393
00:38:13,556 --> 00:38:17,257
Oh..You mean a liar?look up there..

394
00:38:19,374 --> 00:38:22,215
What is that?
-The last guy who lied to me..

395
00:38:22,315 --> 00:38:24,275
Daddy took care of him..

396
00:38:37,594 --> 00:38:41,494
Let's raise our skulls to
the champion of fear..

397
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:46,454
Long live the champ..

398
00:38:46,853 --> 00:38:49,794
I think i'll be drinking out of my head soon
-No silly..

399
00:38:49,894 --> 00:38:53,395
This is how  Vikings welcome guests

400
00:38:57,573 --> 00:39:01,394
So i am assuming this is organic
vegetable juice?

401
00:39:01,494 --> 00:39:03,864
It is vegetable juice allright..

402
00:39:06,832 --> 00:39:09,413
That's organic allright..

403
00:39:31,111 --> 00:39:32,952
Look..

404
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:47,871
That way..
-Yeah..that way..

405
00:39:47,971 --> 00:39:51,651
Wait..i have an idea

406
00:39:54,450 --> 00:40:02,151
Telegraf..Statograf..Kryptograf

407
00:40:04,651 --> 00:40:07,951
Rifraf..Hafenaf

408
00:40:10,009 --> 00:40:11,690
What's so funny?

409
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:15,069
You hear that Asterix?All their names end in "af"

410
00:40:15,169 --> 00:40:19,570
Asteraf actually,my name is Asteraf
,Obelaf..

411
00:40:19,769 --> 00:40:24,290
Obelaf..Hahaha
-I don't have you on the invitation list..

412
00:40:27,029 --> 00:40:29,249
Here..right here..

413
00:40:30,168 --> 00:40:33,469
Ok ..are have officially sneaked in

414
00:40:38,568 --> 00:40:42,149

415
00:40:45,368 --> 00:40:48,889
Hey you..come here!
-Wow!He is back up already?

416
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:53,567
Hey..they are tougher that the Romans,
don't you think?I'll handle him this time..

417
00:40:53,667 --> 00:40:57,868
Ok ..but whatever you do don't get
yourself..

418
00:40:58,567 --> 00:41:00,988
Noticed..
-What's going on here?

419
00:41:01,088 --> 00:41:05,607
Can't i have a moment of piece and quiet
to eat my Wallace ala Crem

420
00:41:05,707 --> 00:41:10,088
Horw do you make Wallace ala Crem?
Oh i t sounds marvellous

421
00:41:10,188 --> 00:41:13,447
It is..
It's just like putting on the creme

422
00:41:13,547 --> 00:41:16,327
Only instead of strawberries,you use..

423
00:41:16,427 --> 00:41:20,026
Wait a minute!who are you?And what
are you doing here?

424
00:41:20,126 --> 00:41:23,967
Well i am Asteraf and this is Obelaf..
-Shut up..

425
00:41:24,067 --> 00:41:27,768
and we are looking for Justforkix
-Ah..the champion

426
00:41:27,886 --> 00:41:31,747
The..champion of what?
-Well..fear of course..

427
00:41:31,856 --> 00:41:33,786
Take a look

428
00:41:50,025 --> 00:41:54,475
Why aren't you dancing with your fiance?
-I am busy

429
00:42:02,284 --> 00:42:05,505
Look..He is in trouble

430
00:42:07,804 --> 00:42:11,585
Hey..leave them alone,they are my friends
-Friends?

431
00:42:11,694 --> 00:42:15,264
Long live the champ..

432
00:42:15,964 --> 00:42:19,824
Well that's great champ,
but now it's time to say goodbye

433
00:42:19,924 --> 00:42:23,335
We are going home, come on..
Say bye bye..Bye bye everyone

434
00:42:23,443 --> 00:42:24,984
Hey i just got here.

435
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:29,685
Well your father is expecting you at the
village by the next full moon

436
00:42:29,785 --> 00:42:34,065
Oh no..Not dad.
-Oh no.. not dad..

437
00:42:34,403 --> 00:42:37,363
I'm staying here
-He's staying here

438
00:42:38,742 --> 00:42:40,883
Enough already.You are coming with us..

439
00:42:40,983 --> 00:42:43,084
Don't talk to him like that.
You are going to get him mad..

440
00:42:43,184 --> 00:42:47,085
Hey..you are just like my dad.
Don't do this.Don't do that.

441
00:42:47,185 --> 00:42:51,186
Well if your dad says that, it's for your
own good,it's because he cares about you.

442
00:42:51,286 --> 00:42:55,142
My father doesn't care about me.
All he ever wanted was to get rid of me.

443
00:42:55,242 --> 00:42:57,402
If he cared about me so much ,

444
00:42:57,502 --> 00:43:01,202
he wouldn't have sent me to stay with
a bunch of country pumpkins.

445
00:43:01,302 --> 00:43:03,803
Pumpkins?
-Oh..Pumpkins?

446
00:43:05,301 --> 00:43:09,722
You put me through a nightmare.
They treat me the way i deserve.

447
00:43:09,822 --> 00:43:14,062
So just go away ,allright?
I never want to see you again..

448
00:43:17,181 --> 00:43:19,441
Obelix wait..

449
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:28,921
Don't forget the tip..

450
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:33,121
Obelix! Wait for me..

451
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,721
Hey..Obelix..

452
00:43:49,879 --> 00:43:54,060
Justforkix.. wait..who are
those two strangers?

453
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,961
Ah.. nobody.

454
00:43:56,061 --> 00:43:59,762
What's the matter? You were having a
great time until they showed up.

455
00:43:59,862 --> 00:44:04,762
It was just a message from my father.
I've got .. problems

456
00:44:05,362 --> 00:44:07,063
You don't understand..

457
00:44:07,163 --> 00:44:11,864
Maybe i understand better than you think.
Don't worry about it.

458
00:44:11,964 --> 00:44:14,265
Come on.. lighten up!

459
00:44:31,577 --> 00:44:37,058
It's past your bed time, go home now.
Beat it!   - Sorry

460
00:44:41,157 --> 00:44:46,557
We should get back to the party..
Yeah..let's go back in

461
00:44:48,236 --> 00:44:49,697
Friends..

462
00:44:49,797 --> 00:44:55,217
I propose a toast ,to the man who brilliantly
accomplished his mission

463
00:44:55,317 --> 00:44:58,718
by capturing the champion of fear..

464
00:44:58,996 --> 00:45:01,937
None other.. than my son Olaf.

465
00:45:02,037 --> 00:45:05,777
Yeah! Long live Olaf..Long live Olaf.

466
00:45:06,515 --> 00:45:10,196
So what does that
big lad of yours want?

467
00:45:10,315 --> 00:45:11,755
Oh.. what?

468
00:45:11,756 --> 00:45:19,057
My son Olaf ,has the honor to
request the hand of your daughter,Abba.

469
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:22,676
My daughter's hand?
-My daughter's hand?

470
00:45:22,776 --> 00:45:25,677
I could use her skull, but her hand.. i don't know..

471
00:45:25,777 --> 00:45:27,515
What's this all about?

472
00:45:27,615 --> 00:45:30,755
Did you promise my hand to
this Fishface??

473
00:45:30,855 --> 00:45:31,993
It's none of your business.

474
00:45:31,994 --> 00:45:36,054
Are you saying choosing a husband
is none of a women's business?

475
00:45:36,154 --> 00:45:37,554
That's the viking way.

476
00:45:37,555 --> 00:45:41,414
You pick out a girl and drag her
by the hair back to your house.

477
00:45:41,514 --> 00:45:46,055
That's how i met your mother!Nothing wrong
with the good old ways,is there Vagia?

478
00:45:46,155 --> 00:45:50,554
Oh.. well ..you know..beside the near sculping
and a nasty case of road rush from the dragon

479
00:45:50,654 --> 00:45:53,373
It was the happiest day of my life!

480
00:45:53,473 --> 00:45:57,753
Yeah..if i can jump in here for a second.
-I am not marrying that hanaprene

481
00:45:57,853 --> 00:46:00,194
You are marrying that hanaprene,
and that's that!

482
00:46:00,195 --> 00:46:01,895
There is not going to be any wedding!

483
00:46:02,294 --> 00:46:04,195
Yes there is!

484
00:46:06,493 --> 00:46:08,394
Stop her!

485
00:46:11,992 --> 00:46:14,973
Justforkix!    Abba!
-No!

486
00:46:15,073 --> 00:46:20,074
Don't worry Abba i'll take care of this!
As the champion i'm warning you, that I..

487
00:46:21,312 --> 00:46:24,253
Tomorrow would be a
good day for the wedding!

488
00:46:24,353 --> 00:46:25,754
Allright!

489
00:46:25,912 --> 00:46:31,853
But first the champion is going
to show us how he flies!

490
00:46:33,551 --> 00:46:38,812
Obelix! Obelix where are you going?
Are you planning to walk back home?

491
00:46:38,912 --> 00:46:39,912
Yes!

492
00:46:39,913 --> 00:46:43,131
I know how you feel , but just because
Justforkix

493
00:46:43,231 --> 00:46:47,292
Don't mention that name!
I've already forgotten it!

494
00:46:47,591 --> 00:46:51,952
That's my doggy.
That's a good doggy who loves his daddy.

495
00:46:52,052 --> 00:46:54,052
Unlike some others,i won't name!

496
00:46:54,470 --> 00:46:57,120
Obelix ,you can't just walk off!
-Why not?

497
00:46:57,220 --> 00:46:59,151
Obelix. Justforkix needs us!

498
00:46:59,251 --> 00:47:02,851
He just doesn't know it!
Now come back and help me!

499
00:47:02,861 --> 00:47:11,131
I can't after what he said! It's impossible!
That's what Justforkix said about lifting a stone

500
00:47:21,289 --> 00:47:23,750
Allright! Go ahead and frighten us!

501
00:47:23,929 --> 00:47:26,809
Why? So we can fly of course!

502
00:47:26,909 --> 00:47:30,510
Is he stupid or what?
-They are completely crazy!

503
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:33,110
I said scare us!

504
00:47:33,210 --> 00:47:35,810
Sure.. here we go..

505
00:47:40,468 --> 00:47:43,388
What's that?
-Είναι μια τρομακτική γκριμάτσα!

506
00:47:43,488 --> 00:47:47,109
Όχι ,αυτή ειναι μια τρομακτική γκριμάτσα!!

507
00:47:50,448 --> 00:47:52,668
There has been misunderstanding.
You are frightening me!

508
00:47:52,768 --> 00:47:58,049
Enough! It's time for the champion
to demonstrate his flying skills.

509
00:47:58,148 --> 00:48:01,228
Take him to the cliff.

510
00:48:01,527 --> 00:48:05,108
Justforkix?

511
00:48:05,567 --> 00:48:08,668
Where is everybody?

512
00:48:08,868 --> 00:48:10,908
There is somebody!

513
00:48:11,087 --> 00:48:13,608
Where is Justforkix? Where did they
take him?

514
00:48:13,708 --> 00:48:17,868
I don't know! Tell me.. where he is

515
00:48:18,087 --> 00:48:21,867
or I'll really lose my temper!

516
00:48:22,106 --> 00:48:23,206
It worked!

517
00:48:23,207 --> 00:48:29,627
Showed how to interogate
the enemy into telling us nothing!

518
00:48:34,346 --> 00:48:36,006
Are you ready for take - off?

519
00:48:36,106 --> 00:48:37,847
Roger!

520
00:48:39,566 --> 00:48:42,866
Oh..we have an organical problem, i'll fix it!

521
00:48:42,966 --> 00:48:46,246
It's my teeth! My teeth is shattering!

522
00:48:46,365 --> 00:48:49,366
False alarm.He is in perfect flying condition!
Request permission

523
00:48:49,466 --> 00:48:53,726
for take-off.
-Roger. Launch the champion!

524
00:48:53,826 --> 00:48:57,846
Stopp!! Wait one moment!

525
00:48:58,005 --> 00:49:03,305
What now?
-Look! Thor is giving us a sign!

526
00:49:08,024 --> 00:49:11,665
Oh too late.. it's gone
Enough stall!

527
00:49:11,865 --> 00:49:14,685
I'm beginning to think that he can't fly!

528
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:19,301
And if he can't fly there will
be no wedding!

529
00:49:19,704 --> 00:49:22,164
He can fly!
-No, i can't!

530
00:49:22,264 --> 00:49:25,424
He is ready now!
-No please!

531
00:49:25,425 --> 00:49:27,525
please don't drop me,i am begging you!
Please!

532
00:49:27,924 --> 00:49:29,924
Drop him!

533
00:49:38,523 --> 00:49:41,284
Amazing! He is flying!

534
00:49:41,384 --> 00:49:44,884
Allright you lilly livered cowards

535
00:49:44,984 --> 00:49:47,402
let's fly off the cliff!

536
00:49:47,502 --> 00:49:50,103
Off the cliff..Off the cliff!

537
00:49:50,203 --> 00:49:55,163
Stop! You.. first of all
you are not scared enough!

538
00:49:55,263 --> 00:49:58,403
and even more important we have
a wedding to attend!

539
00:49:58,503 --> 00:50:00,243
Oh.. right!

540
00:50:02,362 --> 00:50:05,083
Wait!what about me?

541
00:50:08,481 --> 00:50:13,222
Olaf.Olaf!
you have to come too!

542
00:50:13,322 --> 00:50:16,623
This is your WE.D.DI.N.G

543
00:50:16,741 --> 00:50:20,362
O..ok if i have to..

544
00:50:20,521 --> 00:50:21,922
What about the champion?

545
00:50:22,022 --> 00:50:27,282
I believe, it want be long now, to his flying
way back home.

546
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:33,121
Kryptograf! You are coming or what?

547
00:50:35,421 --> 00:50:37,922
Coming.. chief!

548
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:45,401
Well, this is really strange!
Maybe fear can make you fly!

549
00:50:52,579 --> 00:50:54,540
You are pretty strong!

550
00:50:54,979 --> 00:50:59,300
Asterix.Obelix!
I am so glad to see you.

551
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:02,160
I didn't think you'd ever
want to do anything with me again..

552
00:51:02,261 --> 00:51:04,361
after.. you know after
what i said to you!

553
00:51:08,099 --> 00:51:10,020
Was i really flying?

554
00:51:12,818 --> 00:51:15,879
Let's get back to the boat!
-No ! We can't go!

555
00:51:15,979 --> 00:51:18,139
The Vikings think, that i..i..i can fly

556
00:51:18,239 --> 00:51:20,638
so the chief has to keep his promise
to Kryptograf.

557
00:51:20,738 --> 00:51:22,139
And his son will marry Abba

558
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:24,639
so that i can teach them how to fly,
except that i can't

559
00:51:24,739 --> 00:51:26,655
and.. we have to stop the wedding!

560
00:51:26,818 --> 00:51:30,439
These Vikings are crazy!
-No no.. we are going home!

561
00:51:30,539 --> 00:51:32,757
Sorry.
-Forget everything i just said!

562
00:51:32,857 --> 00:51:36,598
I hate you.

563
00:51:46,957 --> 00:51:48,798
My little girl.

564
00:51:54,097 --> 00:51:58,097
Stop! Turn around. We
have to take Abba with us!

565
00:51:58,206 --> 00:51:59,796
No sir.we don't have time!

566
00:51:59,896 --> 00:52:02,117
Besides we can't kidnap the
chief's daughter!

567
00:52:02,217 --> 00:52:05,177
But she wants to be kidnapped!

568
00:52:05,277 --> 00:52:08,277
Let's give the kid his Viking.
It would make him so happy!

569
00:52:08,377 --> 00:52:10,037
Out of the question!

570
00:52:10,137 --> 00:52:13,157
And don't make any more trouble!
-Hey don't get mad at me

571
00:52:13,257 --> 00:52:16,116
I didn't do anything!
-No?

572
00:52:16,835 --> 00:52:18,776
Not in front of the kid!

573
00:52:18,876 --> 00:52:21,177
If we'd taken Justforkix straight from
the feast

574
00:52:21,277 --> 00:52:24,536
We wouldn't be in this risk!
And why didn't we take him?

575
00:52:24,636 --> 00:52:28,876
Because mr Obelix,had to be a big
baby and run off soaking!

576
00:52:28,976 --> 00:52:29,976
And what about you?

577
00:52:29,977 --> 00:52:33,917
If you'd been nicer to him at the feast,
he would have agreed to come with us!

578
00:52:34,017 --> 00:52:36,918
I am tired of all your if this is..
and if that..

579
00:52:37,018 --> 00:52:40,634
Oh i get it!
Only mr Asterix has any brains!

580
00:52:40,734 --> 00:52:43,335
But mr Asterix doesn't know how to talk to kids!

581
00:52:43,435 --> 00:52:45,754
You think i don't know how to talk to kids?

582
00:52:45,854 --> 00:52:49,955
What do you think Justforkix?
You think i don't know how to talk to you?

583
00:52:50,055 --> 00:52:51,956
Justforkix?

584
00:52:56,354 --> 00:52:58,235
No..Ahh..

585
00:52:58,933 --> 00:53:01,703
Can't make me marry !

586
00:53:01,803 --> 00:53:07,074
No!.
-It reminds me of my wedding day!

587
00:53:07,253 --> 00:53:11,954
You nearly bit my finger off before
we ganged you!

588
00:53:12,054 --> 00:53:13,533
Good times!

589
00:53:13,653 --> 00:53:17,354
You are going to be in big trouble,
when Justforkix gets back!

590
00:53:17,454 --> 00:53:20,593
But he is not coming back!
He flew away!

591
00:53:20,693 --> 00:53:24,312
And i don't think he's ever coming back!

592
00:53:24,412 --> 00:53:27,033
Nobody move! Stop the wedding!

593
00:53:27,152 --> 00:53:31,033
Hooray the champ!
-Justforkix!

594
00:53:31,212 --> 00:53:34,953
What are you doing here?
You were fallin..Ah?

595
00:53:34,954 --> 00:53:36,654
I mean flying away..

596
00:53:36,653 --> 00:53:40,993
Liar! you know i can't...

597
00:53:42,392 --> 00:53:45,673
Possible let this wedding go on.

598
00:53:49,051 --> 00:53:51,492
Justforkix what happened to you?

599
00:53:51,592 --> 00:53:53,493
Get him boys!

600
00:54:01,191 --> 00:54:05,836
Hey! Hands off our kid!
Right now buster!

601
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:24,031
That's our chance!
Let's go out of here!

602
00:54:24,409 --> 00:54:28,330
Follow them! Kill the champion!
Do you understand?

603
00:54:28,430 --> 00:54:32,231
Kill the champion.
That i understand!

604
00:54:34,969 --> 00:54:37,730
We have to make it to the harbour!

605
00:54:42,969 --> 00:54:47,029
Why do we need a boat?
You can just fly away and take me with you!

606
00:54:47,129 --> 00:54:51,629
Right..sorry..listen..
I'm not scared enough!

607
00:54:54,588 --> 00:54:57,389
Look!

608
00:55:06,328 --> 00:55:11,628
If you touch her , i'll break you in
two.. like this!

609
00:55:12,607 --> 00:55:16,328
Potion is not working any more!
I have to visualize to break!

610
00:55:16,428 --> 00:55:18,848
Like this?

611
00:55:21,187 --> 00:55:24,088
Great!you are afraid!

612
00:55:24,547 --> 00:55:29,147
Fly away! you can carry me with you!

613
00:55:30,366 --> 00:55:32,627
You are still not scared enough?

614
00:55:32,727 --> 00:55:37,187
I'm plenty scared! But..
I... can't fly!

615
00:55:37,287 --> 00:55:39,188
What?
Woah..

616
00:56:04,305 --> 00:56:08,706
Abba! Are you allright?

617
00:56:09,125 --> 00:56:13,385
You lied to me?
You are as bad as all the others!

618
00:56:13,485 --> 00:56:15,165
Abba wait!

619
00:56:15,265 --> 00:56:20,945
I'm sorry! I never meant to lie to you!
It just sort of happened!

620
00:56:42,923 --> 00:56:45,944
Go find Asterix and Obelix!

621
00:57:00,882 --> 00:57:04,482
Now that's what i call the real fight!
Much more fun than the Romans!

622
00:57:04,582 --> 00:57:10,143
You know.. we should invite them down
to invade our village sometime

623
00:57:10,702 --> 00:57:14,663
Oh no! where is Justforkix?

624
00:57:15,662 --> 00:57:17,622
What's that?

625
00:57:19,961 --> 00:57:24,102
Dogmatix. What he say?
What's the message?

626
00:57:26,181 --> 00:57:28,721
It's something about Justforkix being
in trouble

627
00:57:28,821 --> 00:57:31,192
She is too kind to say more!

628
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:44,501
Nice technique.
That bird has talent!

629
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:49,661
We better follow her!

630
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:00,420
Abba , we have to get away!

631
00:58:13,559 --> 00:58:16,180
This is going to be fun!

632
00:58:18,179 --> 00:58:21,179
Don't kill him!

633
00:58:48,357 --> 00:58:51,738
Who is the champ now, ha?

634
00:59:00,137 --> 00:59:03,457
Ha.. Over there!

635
00:59:16,376 --> 00:59:20,377
Our boy is coming along isn't he?

636
00:59:22,896 --> 00:59:24,796
Abba?

637
00:59:26,596 --> 00:59:28,497
Abba..

638
00:59:31,795 --> 00:59:36,616
Olaf! They are coming!
Kill him now!

639
00:59:37,775 --> 00:59:39,896
Where are you?

640
00:59:42,865 --> 00:59:45,446
Hi dad!

641
00:59:50,594 --> 00:59:56,015
The champion.
He is flying away with your daughter!

642
00:59:59,594 --> 01:00:02,555
Hold it right there!

643
01:00:02,774 --> 01:00:04,295
You again!

644
01:00:04,514 --> 01:00:06,694
Stop him, before he flies away!

645
01:00:06,794 --> 01:00:12,114
He is not going to fly away!
He is a liar ,and a cheat and a phoney!

646
01:00:12,293 --> 01:00:16,334
But we saw him fly.
-That's right. We did!We did

647
01:00:16,653 --> 01:00:21,094
It was all a trick!
-See?

648
01:00:21,793 --> 01:00:25,653
That was me! I was holding him up
with a rope. Am i right dad?

649
01:00:25,753 --> 01:00:28,913
You idiot.
That was supposed to be a secret!

650
01:00:29,013 --> 01:00:30,973
He can't fly?

651
01:00:31,573 --> 01:00:35,274
So you were trying to trick me!

652
01:00:35,792 --> 01:00:38,813
You're shaking! Are you afraid?

653
01:00:38,992 --> 01:00:43,293
No.. no chief! Well..maybe a snitch!
Tiny fear..

654
01:00:43,393 --> 01:00:46,453
You are in the right condition to fly!

655
01:00:46,562 --> 01:00:52,212
Odin lied to me!
Fear can't make you fly..

656
01:00:54,512 --> 01:00:56,113
Abba!

657
01:00:56,213 --> 01:00:57,913
Justforkix!

658
01:00:59,614 --> 01:01:02,415
Abba. Hold On

659
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:19,671
Stay where you are! We're coming!

660
01:01:30,590 --> 01:01:34,209
Flying is the only way out of this..

661
01:01:34,309 --> 01:01:36,250
but that's impossible!

662
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:46,239
You know a very good friend once told me

663
01:01:46,339 --> 01:01:50,985
how can you know something is impossible
if you don't try?

664
01:01:54,958 --> 01:01:57,799
No! Justforkix..

665
01:01:58,358 --> 01:02:00,779
No...No

666
01:02:05,118 --> 01:02:07,019
Obelix! look....

667
01:02:11,338 --> 01:02:13,159
He did it!

668
01:02:15,338 --> 01:02:18,398
He can fly?

669
01:02:20,808 --> 01:02:24,009
You saved my life!

670
01:02:31,877 --> 01:02:35,058
You see? Did you see that?
DO you see  what he is doing now?

671
01:02:35,177 --> 01:02:40,677
Oh yes.. He is doing good..
he is doing really good!

672
01:02:50,806 --> 01:02:53,687
You see Obelix.It's not fear that
gives you wings!

673
01:02:53,787 --> 01:02:55,087
It's love!

674
01:02:59,685 --> 01:03:02,406
Hello? Vikings?

675
01:03:03,165 --> 01:03:08,346
I have congestion! Very weak!
Needing help now.Please!

676
01:03:16,445 --> 01:03:17,846
A little more boar?

677
01:03:17,965 --> 01:03:23,390
Oh yeah..allow me to pour you
another mug of beer!

678
01:03:29,284 --> 01:03:34,765
No..No..we aren't
going to make it in time! Faster!Faster!

679
01:03:40,064 --> 01:03:42,045
Where is my son?

680
01:03:42,145 --> 01:03:45,304
I told you! He's gone fishing!

681
01:03:45,404 --> 01:03:49,724
No! You said he had gone hunding!

682
01:03:49,903 --> 01:03:52,469
That's right!
Hunding for bears!

683
01:03:52,903 --> 01:03:58,394
Coming from Parisium ,i'm sure you will
appreciate my newest composition.

684
01:04:15,722 --> 01:04:20,043
I want to see my son..NOW!

685
01:04:22,342 --> 01:04:24,203
Hi dad!

686
01:04:25,701 --> 01:04:30,607
I get it! I know my boy allright.
Always after the girls..

687
01:04:45,461 --> 01:04:49,561
And Justforkix fought Olaf with just a
boom from a sail boat!

688
01:04:49,661 --> 01:04:53,121
He was like an one man army!

689
01:04:53,221 --> 01:04:58,260
Vitalstatistix i want to thank
you for what you did for my son!

690
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:03,581
You should thank Asterix and Obelix.
They did it all!

691
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:07,681
It wasn't us! It was all your son..

692
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,040
Justforkix..

693
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:14,141
No i'm not going to shake your hand!

694
01:05:22,739 --> 01:05:26,520
Son.. i'm proud of you!

695
01:05:37,238 --> 01:05:40,279
A little gift for the hostess.

696
01:05:40,558 --> 01:05:42,359
Modern Viking design

697
01:05:42,459 --> 01:05:46,360
Skull muds, lambs, furniture, we make
some really lovely stuff, you know..

698
01:05:46,460 --> 01:05:54,160
And this is fully Automatix,Unhygienix
Geriatrix, and our resident musician Kakofonix.

699
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:58,301
You hear that? All their names end in "IX". HAHA

700
01:05:59,961 --> 01:06:05,712
Perhaps you gentleman from the North ,
would like to enjoy an original Gaul ballad!

701
01:06:06,598 --> 01:06:08,999
Sure.. Sure.. I'd love to..

702
01:06:09,099 --> 01:06:11,100
Ok.. This is the moment!

703
01:06:25,199 --> 01:06:29,000
No more.. no more..
I feel crazy

704
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:32,801
My legs are jelly!
What's wrong with me?

705
01:06:32,901 --> 01:06:34,801
Now..that's fear!

706
01:06:38,801 --> 01:06:43,002
If this is fear, ...we can fly!

707
01:06:50,602 --> 01:06:55,702
I was wondering Kalifix,
what's the use of fear?

708
01:06:56,102 --> 01:06:57,803
Kalifix!

709
01:06:57,903 --> 01:06:59,103
What?

710
01:06:59,104 --> 01:07:01,995
i said what is the use of fear?

711
01:07:02,105 --> 01:07:04,996
Fear is what makes us brave

712
01:07:05,096 --> 01:07:08,997
- Untranslated subtitle -

713
01:07:24,896 --> 01:07:29,397
And so for the vikings a new adventure begins

714
01:07:29,497 --> 01:07:34,498
because you have to admit their scientific expedition succeedeed

715
01:07:34,598 --> 01:07:38,498
beyond their wildest dreams

716
01:07:38,598 --> 01:07:44,499
Is that fog?
i hate fog,i cant stand.

717
01:07:44,899 --> 01:07:48,600
I want my mommy. I don't want any fog

718
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:53,501
Mommy Mommy
