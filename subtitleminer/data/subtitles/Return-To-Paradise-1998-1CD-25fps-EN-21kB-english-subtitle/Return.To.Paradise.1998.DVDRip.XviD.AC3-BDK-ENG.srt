1
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,198
<i>They were my two best friends
in the whole world. For five weeks.</i>

2
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,516
<i>It was a total accident we even met.</i>

3
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,269
<i>Me, a bum from Brooklyn
using phoney frequent-flyer miles.</i>

4
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,553
<i>Tony Croft was kind of a golden boy
from Harvard School of Architecture.</i>

5
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:44,312
<i>We met Lewis McBride, this long-haired
Greenpeace tree-hugger guy.</i>

6
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,274
<i>So the plan was to party
till we ran out of cash in Malaysia.</i>

7
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,235
<i>It was a paradise of rum, girls,
and good, cheap hash.</i>

8
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,671
Whoo!

9
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,751
Whoo!

10
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,515
I don't understand
a word you're saying to me.

11
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,998
But this is my least favourite part
anyway, the talking stuff.

12
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,430
- Do you know what I mean?
- Hm.

13
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,200
You do?

14
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,953
Good morning, bro'. What's up?

15
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,435
Did you sleep good, you little dreamer?

16
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,598
What did you do that for?

17
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,997
It's my last day, Lew.
Get up. We'll go do some stuff.

18
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,317
- Maybe it shouldn't be your last day.
- Maybe it shouldn't.

19
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,909
Maybe you should get a haircut.

20
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,038
- Wow!
- You're up early.

21
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,038
- What kind of party's this?
- My party.

22
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,470
Your party?

23
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:29,117
Oh, yeah. It's your aggressive
instincts. I can hear them.

24
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,230
- Where you boys from? America?
- Malaysian for, "Do you have money?"

25
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,319
- Yes, we're from the States.
- You have fun here?

26
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,556
Uh, it could be better.

27
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,153
Listen, I got something special for you.

28
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:51,957
- Yeah? What?
- I got special animal potion.

29
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,153
- You want?
- Animal potion?

30
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,830
Number one aphrodisiac. Keep you
hard as a rock all night. You want?

31
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,190
It sounds painful.
Thanks. It's all right.

32
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,198
- Yeah, I want to see this.
- You want to see.

33
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,631
- Your friend? You want to see?
- Sure. Yeah.

34
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,912
- OK. Follow me.
- I'll tell you what this is about.

35
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,194
Yeah. All right, this is good.
This is all good.

36
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,712
Lewis, this doesn't look like
the number one pharmacy to me.

37
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,278
Hey, yo! Brother, yo!

38
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,988
- Special delivery for you.
- Oh, this is good.

39
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,478
Good stuff. Original. Good. Very good.

40
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,797
- This is rhino horn, isn't it?
- Ah, smart man.

41
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,515
Rhino horn good.
American, Japanese like it.

42
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,554
- What are you doing? Come on.
- You take it. Listen, listen.

43
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,558
Woman like it.
Keep you hard. Keep you hard. Good.

44
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,957
Even if this worked... You listen to me.

45
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,914
If this worked, which it doesn't,
you're murdering an endangered species.

46
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,839
- They're not gonna get that.
- Yo, yo!

47
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,191
- I know you're trying to make a buck...
- Ten bucks! Ten bucks!

48
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,358
It doesn't have to get fuckin' violent.
I'm talking to you.

49
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,314
- You listen!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

50
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,512
Hey, man! Fuck!

51
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,828
What the fuck is up, man?

52
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,878
Get the fuck out of here.

53
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,958
- Fuck you, you little fucker!
- Easy. Easy. OK. OK.

54
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,434
Yihoo!

55
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,311
Stop moving the bike.
You've got to balance it.

56
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,476
Ha-hah!

57
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,072
- Slow it down!
- This is a really steep hill.

58
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,079
Brake!

59
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,473
Are you all right, man?
Are you all right?

60
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,116
Are you OK?

61
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,153
Oh, my God. Holy shit, bro'.

62
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,030
Thanks for the help, guys.

63
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,790
Are you gonna push that back
to Penang?

64
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,310
- Let the bike go, brother.
- I'm not gonna leave it.

65
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:48,195
Lewis, the deposit we put down
on that bike is five times its worth.

66
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,709
Why are you pushing the fucking bike?

67
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,912
I'm not gonna leave it.
This is his bread and butter.

68
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,714
- You're out of your mind.
- Maybe if you helped me out.

69
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,832
- We'd go so much quicker.
- Here, I'll push it.

70
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,634
I'll push the fucking thing. Here.

71
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,592
Thank you.

72
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,760
- You know what?
- Oh!

73
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,988
Nice shot, Sheriff. Really.

74
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,988
- Oh, that's great.
- Let's get home. Come on.

75
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,432
Friends for life, man.

76
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,757
- You guys gotta give me your addresses.
- Yeah, give me yours.

77
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,509
When I get mine, I'll give you
my address, down there in Borneo.

78
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,995
- Where?
- Borneo.

79
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,918
You got a girlfriend there, man?

80
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,113
No. I got the
Orang-utan Reintroduction Project.

81
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,199
- The what project?
- This group rescues orang-utans

82
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,551
that have been kept as pets,
and integrates them back in the wild.

83
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,876
I'm gonna go down and volunteer.

84
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,516
Bro', if the apes need humans
to save them, then they're fucked.

85
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,712
Pay no attention to him.
He's always dumping on somebody.

86
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,036
- That's cool.
- What about you, golden boy?

87
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,835
You can't wait to put all those things
you call buildings up in New York.

88
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:08,352
Skyscrapers. No, man, they'll be
beautiful. Touching the clouds.

89
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:13,188
You guys don't realise how good
you have it right now, right here.

90
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,550
So eager to get on
with your charmed lives

91
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,149
that you miss what's happening now.

92
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,272
You know what I mean?

93
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,271
We got mellow hash, right?

94
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,789
We got coconuts filled with rum.

95
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,152
We got beautiful, gracious chicks that
like us just cos we're Yankees and tall.

96
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:37,878
- Some of us.
- And you've got this warm, calm water.

97
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,072
It's like God's own bathtub
or something, man.

98
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,913
Hey, Lew, are you really gonna stay here
and try to save those gorillas?

99
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,678
- Yeah.
- That's cool, man.

100
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,394
That's totally cool, Lew. Totally cool.

101
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,559
You sound, uh, interested.
You wanna join me?

102
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:58,958
The flight's tomorrow.
Can't change the ticket. No refund.

103
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,913
Think about it.

104
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,476
- Morning.
- Hey, good morning, man.

105
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,478
- How do you feel?
- Good, good.

106
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:38,193
So? Is it civilisation
and its discontents

107
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,790
or uh... you, me and the monkeys?

108
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,833
I don't think I'm cut out for that kind
of thing, Lew. That's for you, man.

109
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:56,711
To tell you the truth...
I don't have that kind of stuff in me.

110
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,679
Well, I think
you're wrong about yourself, but...

111
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,871
- Give 'em hell.
- Where are you gonna go?

112
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,834
New York is calling you home.
Martinis, pretty girls, the Yankees.

113
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,951
Or do you want to stay here?

114
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,350
Don't smoke it all in one bowl.

115
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,516
You keep this. I got Tony's.

116
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,995
I wouldn't take Excedrin
out of this country.

117
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,556
- Why did we buy so much hash?
- At those prices we had to.

118
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,352
Uh-oh.

119
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,519
Well, I guess this is it, man. Yeah?

120
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,792
- See ya, buddy. Good luck.
- I'm gonna miss you guys.

121
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,629
Bullshit. You'll find a couple of chimps
prettier than both of us.

122
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,308
You fucker.

123
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,315
Take care.

124
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,273
- I'll see you.
- All right.

125
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,675
Safe travels.

126
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,435
Yeah, Gaby, listen. Yeah.

127
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,473
OK. You know what?

128
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,389
No, I just, you know,
I can't talk about anything right now.

129
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,355
Listen uh... No, I'm not interested
in discussing this right now.

130
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,994
I got two people in the back of my car.
I'm working.

131
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,876
Gaby, maybe when this shift's over,
I'll call you, we'll grab a bite, OK?

132
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,719
That's my dispatcher. I gotta go.

133
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,911
I gotta go. Bye.

134
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,438
Yeah, it's Four, under way.

135
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,200
<i>Can you sling a pick-up
at the Stanhope?</i>

136
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,675
<i>Lady named Eastern, asked for you.</i>

137
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,917
Eastern? Eastern, yeah.
Where's the drop at?

138
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,951
<i>She didn't say.</i>

139
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,390
Fuck!

140
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:30,152
I apologise for the sudden stop, folks,
but hopefully you were belted in.

141
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,749
OK. Here we are.

142
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,871
Here. Take that.

143
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,594
Pleasure serving you as always,
Mr Homer.

144
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,990
- This is Ravitch.
- Hey, it's Sheriff.

145
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,919
How much is a famous
divorce attorney worth to you?

146
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,270
He's worth squat, brother. I'm single.

147
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:19,473
What if he's out boinking and getting
bombed and his wife's not with him?

148
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,798
- That's a different story.
- Ravitch, can't you find another desk?

149
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,468
- I say two bills.
- You're a cheap son of a bitch.

150
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,114
- Grab a pen.
- I'm sorry.

151
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,276
OK, give it to me.

152
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,672
Thank you.

153
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,317
We headed anywhere in particular?

154
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,034
How about we just drive
around the park for a bit?

155
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,708
You got it. Around the park.

156
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,233
I haven't driven you before.
I never forget a face.

157
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,271
Do you mind if I smoke in the car?

158
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,439
It's the only place in town left
that you can smoke. Go ahead.

159
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,516
So who recommended me, Miss Eastern?

160
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:29,632
- Please call me Beth.
- OK. Who recommended me, Beth?

161
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,597
- Lewis McBride.
- Lew?

162
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,917
Did he say to look up old Sheriff
when you got to town?

163
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:42,989
- How did you know where to find me?
- Lewis said you lived in Brooklyn.

164
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,078
- Odds were you'd be in the book.
- Yeah, huh?

165
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:50,831
And odds were I'd still be stuck
in Brooklyn, which obviously I am.

166
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,190
So where is Lew? Is he in town here?

167
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:59,758
Sheriff, the day you and Tony
left Penang,

168
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,953
a man came looking
for a bike you guys had rented.

169
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,037
He brought the police.

170
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,358
Only they didn't find the bike,
but they did find 104 grams of hashish,

171
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:14,155
some stashed in the hut,
some in the trash.

172
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:19,718
Jesus Christ.
And Lewis caught hell for that, huh?

173
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,797
Yeah. He's spent
the last two years in prison.

174
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,468
Oh, my God. Jesus Christ.

175
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,399
What a nightmare that must be, huh?

176
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,068
Is he still in prison now?

177
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:36,273
- For eight more days, yeah.
- I wish I'd have known sooner.

178
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,914
I don't know if
I could have done anything but...

179
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,759
At least he's getting out
in eight days though, huh?

180
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:46,192
That's not the case. Anybody found
with more than 100 grams of hashish

181
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,197
is considered to be trafficking.

182
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,597
Trafficking?
What is that, like, dealing?

183
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:56,555
Sheriff, in order for Lewis
not to be considered a dealer,

184
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,111
you and Tony have to fly back to Penang

185
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,517
and accept your share
of the responsibility.

186
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,639
And what about me and Tony?
What happens to us?

187
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:13,914
The deal was that if both of you
go back, it's three years apiece,

188
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,554
and if only one of you goes back,
it's six.

189
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,876
Wait. Hold on. It's three? It's six?

190
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,150
Finish that sentence for me please.

191
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,636
You're talking about three years
in prison. Six years in prison.

192
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,671
Let me make this clear to you.

193
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,950
In Malaysia, dealers get death.

194
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,674
Jesus Christ,
for a shitty brick of hash?

195
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:36,158
- So in eight days from now...
- Lewis McBride is going to hang.

196
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,400
What are you, his lawyer?

197
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,114
I'm his American lawyer, yeah.

198
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,993
So how about we have dinner
and talk more about this?

199
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,919
I can't. I'm on till 2:00.
But thank you very much.

200
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:18,272
- Drinks then?
- At 2:00? Don't you sleep?

201
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,040
- I want to do this more. Breakfast?
- Can't.

202
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,755
- Lunch?
- I pulled a day shift.

203
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,953
Let's have dinner then.
Tomorrow night. Here. Say 7:00?

204
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,038
- Tomorrow at 7:00.
- Night.

205
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,151
Thanks.

206
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,477
- Excuse me, I'm looking for Tony Croft.
- Yeah, he's up top.

207
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,635
Thanks.

208
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:02,953
So if you don't go back, Tony,
Lewis will hang.

209
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,031
Sorry.

210
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:13,839
You can't come out of nowhere and tell
me the bottom's dropped out of my life

211
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,952
and I've got a week
to brace for the impact.

212
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,549
I'm sorry, Tony.
That's exactly what I am doing.

213
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,430
I don't understand. How come it took
you guys two years to tell me this?

214
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,710
Lewis never mentioned the two of you.

215
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:31,038
Not when he was convicted two years ago,
not when he was sentenced to death.

216
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,835
It was only last week when
his final pardon appeal was rejected.

217
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:38,316
I found a detective,
the second he found you, here I am.

218
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,795
You gotta understand,
this isn'tjust about me, all right?

219
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,468
Like anybody,
I have a lot of responsibilities.

220
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:51,399
I'm engaged. I have a fiancée.

221
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,398
I want to start a family.

222
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,989
Family's wonderful.

223
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,156
Lewis would like to have kids too.

224
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,478
If you can postpone having yours
for a few years, he'll have that chance.

225
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:10,389
I'm staying at the Stanhope.
Could you call me there tonight?

226
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:14,309
- All right. I will.
- Thanks. Thanks, Tony.

227
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,197
<i>- This is Beth.
- Miss Eastern? Hi. It's Tony Croft.</i>

228
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,312
- Tony, hi.
- Listen.

229
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,638
Kerrie and I talked this over
and we want to, um...

230
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:02,558
Well, first of all I wanna say...
this is ridiculous.

231
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:06,799
There is no way in hell
that I'll do the six years.

232
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:11,193
But if Sheriff agrees to go back...

233
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,839
Um... well, that's another...

234
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:23,471
Uh... In that case, um... you know,
it'd be pretty hard to say no.

235
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,390
Uh... OK. What you've said
has been very clear.

236
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,309
I'm about to have dinner with Sheriff.
I'll call you in the morning.

237
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,239
<i>- All right. I'll talk to you then.
- Thank you, Tony.</i>

238
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,953
Good night.

239
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,391
- Hey.
- Hi.

240
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,592
- Surprised I showed?
- No. Why?

241
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,473
- Cos I am.
- Eastern party?

242
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,636
- Yeah.
- Right this way.

243
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,238
Thanks.

244
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,433
- Would you care for a cocktail?
- Glass of house red.

245
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,710
- OK.
- I'll have a rum and Coke, please.

246
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:25,833
Thank you. Reminds me of Malaysia.
Rum and Coke.

247
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,791
- So have you spoken to Tony?
- Yes, I did.

248
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,877
- Yeah?
- Mm-hm.

249
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,231
Tony said he was going to go back.

250
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,069
Yeah? Tony said he was going to call me
when he got back from Penang.

251
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,032
So...

252
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,277
So what are you saying?
I can't count on Tony's word?

253
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,516
No, I'm not saying that. Just, uh...

254
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,234
I think it's good
Tony says he's going back.

255
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,797
How come?

256
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,276
- Because I'm...
- Excuse me. Your drinks.

257
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,916
- Thanks.
- Thanks a lot.

258
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,308
Tony's only going back
if you're going back.

259
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,636
- You didn't say that.
- I didn't finish.

260
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:14,072
OK, please finish then, Beth.
Finish what you were going to say.

261
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:23,230
I don't expect you to do this
without some sort of compensation.

262
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,758
Both of Lewis's parents have passed on.
They left a little something.

263
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,952
How does $50,000 sound?

264
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:35,709
$50,000? That sounds fine. Just fine.

265
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:41,319
But for each year. $50,000 a year.

266
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,476
You want me to pay you $150,000

267
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:47,639
for assuming what is, in fact,
your share of the responsibility?

268
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:53,039
No, not you. Lewis's estate.
I mean, they got the heavy money, right?

269
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:56,630
You come to New York on what was
pretty much a fishing expedition.

270
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,479
You stay on the Park,
eat here, not some coffee shop.

271
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,511
All right.

272
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,951
So I will draw up
the draft agreement tomorrow.

273
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:09,199
If you promise me right now
that you're going to go back.

274
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,236
You know what's funny to me?
Really funny?

275
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:19,596
People like you think
you can just buy people like me.

276
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:23,156
But guess what. I wouldn't walk
into your shit storm for any price.

277
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,715
Any chance there might have been
that I'd go back

278
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,911
went bye-bye
when you tried to pay me off.

279
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,395
- Menus?
- I'm sorry. There's been a mistake.

280
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:36,232
I wouldn't want you to buy me dinner.
Because then I would be exploiting you.

281
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,556
Good night.

282
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,473
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to insult you.

283
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:54,036
You insulted yourself.
You made your play. We're finished.

284
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,472
I would make any play to save Lewis's
life. I know you care about that.

285
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:01,069
Don't let my nickname fool you.

286
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,714
It's a bastardisation
of my name, Volgecherev.

287
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:07,708
I keep my mouth shut and my head down.
But I do wish Lewis luck.

288
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:12,118
I appreciate your concern for his
wellbeing. But I am persistent.

289
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:16,518
That's great. Don't waste it on me.
You've only got a few days left.

290
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:21,316
You're appealing to emotions I don't
have and morality I can't afford.

291
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:25,593
That doesn't change the fact
that a man's life hangs in the balance.

292
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,916
Good night.

293
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:49,354
How're you doin', man?
What's up, Sheriff?

294
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,551
How're you doin', Tony?

295
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,677
Yep.

296
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,476
Here we are.

297
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,717
- Look, I'm freezing.
- Yeah. My secretary's out today.

298
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:09,515
I apologise for the inconvenience.
You'll have to seat yourself.

299
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,993
So this is the office, huh?

300
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:25,149
Let's just sort this out without
that lawyer breathing down our necks.

301
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,476
- She's pretty intense, huh?
- No shit, man.

302
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,194
After she ambushed me,
I couldn't eat for two days.

303
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:34,552
My girlfriend forced some toast down
my throat this morning. I threw it up.

304
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:39,038
That's kind of a dry run for our next
three years in Penang Prison.

305
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:45,114
So you're gonna do this?
You're going back?

306
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,150
No.

307
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,953
You don't give a shit, do you?

308
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:00,914
- You think I don't care about Lewis?
- That's what you're acting like.

309
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,076
You don't know
the first thing about me.

310
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:06,909
Fine. All right. Then how come
you're so ready to slam the door on him?

311
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,873
I know something
about guys who have clubs and badges.

312
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,436
I've had my ass kicked by those
bastards. It's not how you think.

313
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:17,189
Doing something good
doesn't mean there'll be a happy ending.

314
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:20,437
- You could very easily die over there.
- Yeah.

315
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,155
- You think of that?
- This is the other side of the coin.

316
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:27,033
If this goes down, God forbid,
and Lewis hangs,

317
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:30,073
you don't think
this is gonna be headline news?

318
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:33,716
Sheriff, this is gonna follow you around
the rest of your life.

319
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:38,596
Whereas the other way we come home
heroes and the city throws us a parade?

320
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,792
Tony, you're a fucking boy scout.
You really are.

321
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,719
Listen to me, OK?

322
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:48,151
Lewis would have gone back
for either of us.

323
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,351
You know that.

324
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,278
That's why I'll never be mistaken
for Lewis McBride.

325
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,710
- Afternoon, Miss Eastern.
- Thank you.

326
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:12,233
<i>Beth Eastern? Hi. I'm MJ Major,
a reporter for the New York Examiner.</i>

327
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,590
- You're a what?
- A reporter.

328
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,958
Really? And what would you want with me?

329
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,993
Come on, Beth. I know
the hanging's in less than a week.

330
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:26,398
Press is exactly what you and the family
need for a public outcry.

331
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,909
- The family wants this kept quiet.
- Really?

332
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:33,636
In this instance, your interests and
the interests of the public converge.

333
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,276
- How did you find out about this?
- My sources at the State Department.

334
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,710
There's a blackout
at the State Department.

335
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:43,310
They passed the buck.
They sold it as diplomacy.

336
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:46,751
That's why you need me, and fast.
I can make this happen fast.

337
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,997
- In 48 hours, Lewis McBride can be...
- No.

338
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:54,990
Listen to me. Do you remember Singapore?
The American kid who graffitied a car?

339
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,192
Because of the media frenzy,
they had to cane the kid.

340
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,995
That was a caning.
To show some national backbone.

341
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,236
- This is a hanging.
- I know that.

342
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:08,479
Some Aussie dope dealer's mother went on
every talk show from Sydney to London.

343
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:12,195
You know what happened? They hung
her son a week early to shut her up.

344
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,390
Excuse me, I've got a really big week.

345
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,319
Beth, I can make miracles happen
in a week.

346
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:23,957
Don't do this. Don't do it.

347
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:28,039
- Wait a minute. Why...
- What? Jesus Christ!

348
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,118
I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. Just...

349
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,948
Can I have that, please?

350
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,876
- Is he boyish?
- What?

351
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,275
Is he cute? Is he clean-cut?

352
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,029
- Cos if I put him on the front page...
- Give me some time.

353
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,718
Give me some time, some space,
and I'll give you your story.

354
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,277
When?

355
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,675
Soon.

356
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,235
I'm gonna call you, Beth.

357
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,198
What are you doing here?

358
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,275
- I have a tape I want you to watch.
- Yeah?

359
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,948
Jesus Christ, you don't let up, do you?

360
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:40,357
- I can't.
- You know what? I'm gonna watch this.

361
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:44,235
Honest to God I am. But I was actually
gonna go get something to eat.

362
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,634
So I'll watch it later.

363
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,549
Are you inviting me to dinner,
or are we still mad at each other?

364
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,916
Both.

365
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,030
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

366
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,518
It's a toast to Lewis.

367
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:12,951
Sweet guy. Loved the animals.
Loved his beer.

368
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,071
- Did he?
- He did.

369
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,475
I never knew that about him.

370
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,435
Tell me something else.

371
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:26,154
- Beer is all I really remember.
- That's it?

372
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,237
- Yeah.
- Wow.

373
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:31,910
- He didn't leave an impression then.
- Lewis? Are you kidding me?

374
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:36,636
- Have you spent a lot of time with him?
- I've never had a beer with him.

375
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:43,155
He is, honestly, Beth, one
of the sweetest people I've ever met.

376
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:46,511
Lewis is the kind of guy...
You'd have a beggar on the street,

377
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:51,032
and he'd just...
he'd touch them somehow, talk to them.

378
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:55,472
The guy could have an illness,
language barrier, whatever it was.

379
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:58,035
He just could see people, I guess.

380
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,671
Got a big heart.

381
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,555
Yeah. That's nice.

382
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,996
What else can you tell me about him?

383
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,760
You are good, aren't you?

384
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,111
Oh, Sheriff, what do you think about me?

385
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,039
I don't know.

386
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:22,312
You seem to think I have
all these wiles and stratagems.

387
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,951
I don't.

388
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,315
I have a man's life in my hands.

389
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,511
I get that.

390
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:38,120
But let me ask you a question, Beth.

391
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,709
And ask yourself this honestly.

392
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,228
Would you go back?

393
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:51,756
I wouldn't ask you or Tony to do this

394
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:55,669
if I hadn't already
answered the question for myself.

395
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,030
Yeah.

396
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:04,796
But I guess, you know, I don't think
you could ever honestly answer that

397
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,150
unless you were
in that situation yourself.

398
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,513
- Hi, Gaby.
- I'm not a piece of dirt you get off on

399
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:16,837
then flush down the john, all right?

400
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:21,636
He'll fuck you and then sneak out,
by the fire escape if he has to.

401
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,991
Unless you don't give a shit.
Unless you're some whore.

402
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,670
I'm his wife.

403
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,950
What?

404
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,118
Fuck you for not wearing a ring.

405
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,836
That's my friend Gaby.

406
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,793
Wow. Good thing you didn't give her
a social disease. We'd all be dead.

407
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,959
- Thanks, Frank. I appreciate it.
- So when did you guys tie the knot?

408
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:02,470
You know what, Frank?
Get the hell outta here, will you?

409
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,639
- OK?
- Yeah.

410
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:11,196
- Well, that was fun.
- That was something.

411
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,073
"I'm his wife. " I like that one.
"I'm his wife. "

412
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,840
Thanks. You left this on the table.

413
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,435
- Please watch it.
- I will, Beth. I will.

414
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,631
Good night.

415
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,078
OK.

416
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:23,431
<i>OK, Lewis, go ahead.</i>

417
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:27,553
<i>Um... Hey, guys.</i>

418
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,952
<i>Sheriff. Tony.</i>

419
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,116
<i>Long time, huh?</i>

420
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,197
<i>I guess if you're seeing this tape</i>

421
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:45,032
<i>you've kind of figured
that my vacation plans... changed.</i>

422
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:48,277
<i>I was set to go off</i>

423
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:53,031
<i>and try and save the orang-utan,
do what I can.</i>

424
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:59,273
<i>Kind of ironic, isn't it?</i>

425
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:03,871
<i>Look who's caged and...</i>

426
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,116
<i>they say soon to be extinct.</i>

427
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,915
<i>Um... this little docudrama here</i>

428
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,554
<i>was not my idea.</i>

429
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,990
<i>I'm sorry, but, um...</i>

430
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,113
<i>the folks
at the American Citizen Service</i>

431
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,675
<i>have done all they can</i>

432
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:26,476
<i>and now they tell me
that you guys are my last chance.</i>

433
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,557
<i>So...</i>

434
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:33,436
<i>I don't know if you're even thinking
about coming back.</i>

435
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:39,112
<i>But if there's the slightest chance,
I will tell you this.</i>

436
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:43,438
<i>Um... I haven't been. uh...</i>

437
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,596
<i>harmed in any way.</i>

438
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,553
<i>I haven't been tortured...</i>

439
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:53,190
<i>except by boredom and hunger.</i>

440
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,198
<i>There's not a whole lot
of good stuff to eat.</i>

441
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,153
<i>No burgers for you, Sheriff. But, uh...</i>

442
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:03,239
<i>There's rice. Plenty of rice.
Your rice needs definitely will be met.</i>

443
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,510
<i>But, um...</i>

444
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,476
<i>If you do...</i>

445
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,749
<i>If you do come back,</i>

446
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,349
<i>I will feel guilty, yes,</i>

447
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:20,348
<i>and... I already do,
just for asking you.</i>

448
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,755
<i>But...</i>

449
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:27,310
<i>at least I won't feel the fear,
and I know that's not fair.</i>

450
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,397
<i>Um...</i>

451
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,717
<i>so that's why I'm doing this.</i>

452
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,998
- Hey!
- I'm busy!

453
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:22,432
- Can't take you today.
- Yeah, well, I can't take you either.

454
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,870
Pop, remember that trip I took
a couple of years back, to Malaysia?

455
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:40,835
Yeah, I remember. Some sleaze was
selling frequent-flyer miles, right?

456
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:45,352
That's not the point. The point is
this guy is still over there in Penang.

457
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:48,836
He's kind of a pal.
But anyway, they're gonna hang him.

458
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:54,797
They found some hashish on him.
But some of the hash was mine.

459
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,150
So if I go back there,

460
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:01,035
I'd have to serve
three years in prison, Penang Prison.

461
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,276
But if I don't go back,
they hang this guy.

462
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:06,472
They don't hang guys for hashish.
I'm not that naive.

463
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,750
You're leaving something out.

464
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,873
I'm not leaving anything out, Dad.
That's the way it is over there.

465
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,674
All right. So maybe you're right
and I'm wrong.

466
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,440
You still want my advice
in this hanging stuff?

467
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,676
- Yeah.
- It feels like an easy call.

468
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:27,153
If you weren't wasting your life here,
it might be different.

469
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,669
But this pal you'll save,

470
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,553
odds are he's worth more than you.

471
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:36,275
So my advice, you go, you do the time.

472
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,998
What's the matter? You look sick.

473
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:46,798
You're my dad. You're supposed to
beg me not to go back.

474
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,912
It's just not
what I expected to hear, I guess.

475
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:52,429
Lighten up. I'm just yanking your crank.

476
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:56,670
Why put yourself through the agony
when you know you're not going?

477
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:01,351
I mean, who's kidding who?
What are we, suckers here?

478
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,670
No, they did what?

479
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,836
They weighed him?

480
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:17,071
For what?

481
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:30,068
Jesus.

482
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:32,999
Uh...

483
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:41,156
Uh... I... I have to get my other...
I have to get the call.

484
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:43,032
Um...

485
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:45,754
It might be one of the guys.
We'll talk tomorrow?

486
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,835
Um... This... this is Beth.

487
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:59,556
Beth, hi. You sound stressed.
This is MJ Major.

488
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,751
<i>Is this a bad time?</i>

489
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,559
No. No, it's not a bad time.

490
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,115
Beth, what's wrong? How can I help?

491
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:14,236
You know... You want to know
how you can help?

492
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:18,592
Just leave me alone, MJ.
Just leave me alone.

493
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:23,476
I've got the resources to a daily paper
with worldwide readership.

494
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,240
<i>We are picked up
by the International Herald Trib.</i>

495
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:30,319
We could be doing anything you want.
Photographs, articles, petitions...

496
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:33,592
Every single one a death warrant, MJ.
A death warrant.

497
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:40,189
Now, I've asked you nicely to stay out
of this until after the hearing.

498
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,154
If I don't get something from you
soon, I'll go straight to your two guys.

499
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,193
You don't know who they are,
or you'd already be there.

500
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,436
I'm hanging up.

501
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,837
Beth, I'm gonna need
to hear from you very soon.

502
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:57,438
You will.

503
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,590
Sheriff. Well, hi.

504
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:04,598
I didn't expect to see you. Come on in.

505
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,870
Thanks. How are you doing?

506
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,836
- Couldn't be better.
- Yeah?

507
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,235
Please give me some good news.

508
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:17,991
Are you, um...
Did you get my message about dinner?

509
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:21,351
Yeah, I got your message
but I can't make dinner. I got plans.

510
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:23,949
But I did want
to return this to you. The tape.

511
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:28,910
Uh... OK.

512
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:32,795
- Did you watch it?
- Yeah, I watched the whole thing.

513
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,956
And, um...

514
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:39,312
I did a lot of soul-searching
last night with this.

515
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,318
And I figure you've got
to know sooner than later

516
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:44,511
because of everything.

517
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:49,111
I just wanted to come and let you know
where you stand with me.

518
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:51,436
That's good.

519
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,151
Where do I stand with you?

520
00:45:56,360 --> 00:46:02,117
I talked to Tony and he said...
He's halfway to Penang already.

521
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:05,676
I think he just needs a nudge.
I think he'll probably go back.

522
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,359
But, um...

523
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:11,872
You know, I looked inside,
deep inside, Beth,

524
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:14,992
to find something, but, uh...

525
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,156
it isn't in me.

526
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:24,355
Oh, it isn't... in you.

527
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:34,117
Jot that down. Do me a favour? Write
that down for me. Just a few words.

528
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:37,517
I'd love to give them to Lew
before he hangs. Letter from a pal.

529
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:41,554
Listen, I... "Searched my soul"
was the best part for me.

530
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,830
I don't know. That's great.

531
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:49,353
He'd love to know that you searched
your soul before you decided not to go.

532
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:53,319
Yeah.

533
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:05,473
They just told me
that they weighed Lewis today

534
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:08,240
for the trap doors of the gallows.

535
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:14,474
- Beth...
- Get out of here.

536
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,915
Get the fuck out of here, Sheriff.

537
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:45,155
- Sheriff is here.
- What do you say? How're you doing?

538
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:49,433
- I thought you had plans.
- I did. A thing at Lincoln Center.

539
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:55,272
You know what I mean? But here I am.
Ready to discuss. What did I order?

540
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:58,916
Sheriff, this is Kerrie, my fiancée.
Kerrie, John Volgecherev.

541
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:00,792
Kerrie, nice to meet you.

542
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,959
You're not as platinum
as I expected you to be.

543
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,595
Listen, Sheriff...

544
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:17,271
It's pretty obvious that you have
no intention of going back, right?

545
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,236
Where?

546
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:27,875
- Is he drunk?
- Oh, you mean, like, back to prison.

547
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:30,514
Right, well, I've never actually been.

548
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,910
Do you have a fork I could use?

549
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:39,035
I've never been to prison, thus, I can't
go back to somewhere I've never been.

550
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:42,312
Thank you.
That is brilliantly unhelpful.

551
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:45,034
- Yes.
- Beth, I checked.

552
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:48,676
Penang Prison is at a third-world level
of sanitation, nutrition,

553
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:51,030
rice rations don't meet minimum...

554
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:55,199
Lewis is provided with food from Amnesty
International. So would Tony be.

555
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:57,960
- Inmates have been tortured.
- He hasn't been.

556
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:01,516
- Inmates have died of typhus.
- Because of overcrowding.

557
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:04,951
Lewis has his own cell, as would Tony,
and Sheriff if he goes back.

558
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:09,517
That's really good. And the other thing
I think you've overlooked

559
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:12,359
is that that building's not up to code.

560
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:14,835
- Oh, Jesus.
- What are you, the class clown?

561
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,918
And who are you to tell them
to give up their freedom?

562
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:20,190
I represent a boy sentenced to death.

563
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,914
Right. For the sake of some client,
you demand...

564
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:27,557
Demand? No, no, no. I don't demand.
I have not demanded anything.

565
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:31,878
...that they endure three or six years
of God knows what. That's insane.

566
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:34,389
Yeah, it's insane, OK?

567
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:41,352
- I'm gonna go back.
- What?

568
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:44,917
OK?

569
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:49,955
I'm sorry, honey.

570
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,230
In the middle of this, what matters?

571
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:57,796
That Lewis doesn't die.
Somebody's got to do something. Please.

572
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,274
Where's the document
that guarantees this deal?

573
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:09,630
The Attorney General of Malaysia
has agreed...

574
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:12,513
So where is it?
Why don't we have a copy?

575
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,069
- It's an oral agreement.
- No.

576
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:18,669
Tony goes nowhere
till we have that document.

577
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:21,189
They don't work that way.
I wish they did.

578
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,516
I cannot get anything to you in writing.

579
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:27,629
Don't.

580
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:30,479
I'll be at home if you want me.

581
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,913
Sorry, Tony. I'm sorry.

582
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:42,476
She's just scared, all right?
She's more scared than I am.

583
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:49,080
You're gonna have to excuse me.

584
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:51,919
If I'm gonna get her
to wait three years for me...

585
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:57,235
I guess six...

586
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:00,834
I shouldn't keep her waiting tonight.

587
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:03,349
Tony, what can I say? Thank you.

588
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,112
Sure.

589
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:10,315
All right, Tony.

590
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:13,432
- See you, man.
- See you later. Good luck with that.

591
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:17,957
Right, Sheriff.
I'll go talk to the firm.

592
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:24,229
Well, quite a party.

593
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:33,033
- Are you gonna go back to your hotel?
- Oh, yes.

594
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:35,549
Gotta call Penang.
Give them the good news.

595
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:38,194
So I guess Lew's gonna be OK then, huh?

596
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:42,033
Which means, you know...

597
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,834
You're off the hook?

598
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,508
- I'm off the hook, huh?
- Good night.

599
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:54,913
Jaffe, I want a follow-up
on the Canarsie fire.

600
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:57,839
- Nice of you to join us, Ravitch.
- It's my pleasure.

601
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:00,793
I'd like some pictures
of the shopkeeper, burnt out.

602
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,433
You got it.

603
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:05,108
MJ, where's my pension fund fraud?

604
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:07,595
I thought you had a CPA
who was ready to talk.

605
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:10,473
I did. And she's given me gold.

606
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:12,830
I'm just fact-checking a few points.

607
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:16,350
And I'm looking for a source
called Sheriff.

608
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:21,070
Ring anybody's bell? Sheriff?

609
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:23,714
OK. Let's go, then.

610
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:54,672
<i>- Yeah?
- Hi. It's Beth.</i>

611
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:58,509
I talked to the garage
and they said you called in sick.

612
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:02,793
<i>- Can I come up and see you?
- Uh... sure.</i>

613
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:11,037
- Hi.
- Hi there.

614
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:14,516
- Hi there.
- I brought some goodies from Zabar's.

615
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:17,234
Jewish penicillin. Cure you right up.

616
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:20,512
Isn't that nice? Should I beware
of lawyers bearing gifts?

617
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:25,275
Think I'm gonna have a beer.
Do you want one?

618
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:28,358
Uh... beer? Sure.

619
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,630
You're quite the avid reader,
aren't you?

620
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:35,274
- Or is this just...
- Yeah, just for showing off.

621
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:38,711
All the visitors I have. I keep my place
real impressive, don't I?

622
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:40,831
It's nice.

623
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:43,110
The books are a recent development.

624
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:45,550
When I was in school,
I tried to avoid reading.

625
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:48,877
Then I graduate
and realise I don't know shit.

626
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:51,036
- Yeah. Who does?
- You know what I mean?

627
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:54,676
So anyway,
I start getting the books and...

628
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:59,037
do some reading,
learn about the world around me.

629
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:03,839
Just trying to be civilised
I guess, Beth.

630
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:09,319
That's good. Lewis said you were
better than you thought you were.

631
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:13,559
A lot of them are pop-up books.
Colouring. That kind of thing.

632
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,514
Where's your passport?

633
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:27,391
- What?
- I just want to see your passport.

634
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:31,036
In case it's not good. I can renew it
tomorrow on an emergency basis

635
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:34,038
if you decide something different.

636
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:39,433
So when you said about me being off the
hook, you were just lying to my face?

637
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:41,551
I think you were lying to yourself.

638
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:45,719
Come on, Sheriff. Only a total bastard
would let Tony go back alone.

639
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:47,990
Yeah, well, I'm not in charge of Tony.

640
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:51,192
- I'm not his dad.
- I know that.

641
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:57,753
But Tony's a man who's got...
Tony's a great guy.

642
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:01,999
But he's got a future
and a sexy fiancée.

643
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:03,838
Yeah.

644
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:07,157
Six years under any circumstances
would be hard as hell,

645
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:09,351
but this case, it's inconceivable.

646
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:12,997
I think Tony's a man of his word.

647
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:21,633
Tony called me three days ago and
told me that he couldn't do six years.

648
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:25,196
I know what he said last night.
I applaud his idealism.

649
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:29,712
But... I can't count on it.

650
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:36,269
I have to have you
on that plane, Sheriff.

651
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:41,710
Please show me your passport.

652
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:48,437
No that it's any of your business,
but my passport's good.

653
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:51,279
- It is? Show it to me.
- Take my word for it.

654
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:53,869
Show it to me.

655
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:58,312
You'd take three years from me
but you wouldn't take my word?

656
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:02,830
OK. All right. I pushed it. I'm sorry.

657
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:12,516
I trust you.

658
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:15,951
You know what?

659
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:19,118
Come on. You're gonna go for me
if you don't have a client?

660
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:23,791
What are you talking about? Wh... What?

661
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,434
You offer me money and I don't take that

662
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:30,553
so you figure, "Why don't I fuck the guy
cos then he'll do what I want. "

663
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:34,389
That's exactly me.
That's actually exactly me.

664
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:38,639
I'll get you to go back because
I'll give you a little sex. That's me.

665
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:41,274
- Go fuck yourself.
- Whoo!

666
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:44,836
That's fun. I'm the guy
who's gotta clean up. That's fun.

667
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:47,998
- Have fun, Sheriff.
- Shut up! You're too noisy!

668
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:50,350
You fucking crazy bastard!

669
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:53,120
Shut up! You're making
too much goddamn noise!

670
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:57,313
Open the door! Open the door, you
fucking pussy! Open the fucking door!

671
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:00,398
- Open your fucking door!
- Sheriff, that's enough!

672
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:03,990
- I'm calling the cops.
- Sheriff.

673
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:07,715
Turnabout's fair game, huh?
Now that you're news, all's fair.

674
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:10,878
You son of a bitch!
Taking pictures of me?

675
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:14,311
- I'll bust your fucking face open!
- I'm doing my job, man.

676
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:18,718
- I'm doing my job! I'm doing my job!
- Get the fuck outta my face.

677
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:20,797
I'll sue your ass.

678
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:23,838
Sheriff!

679
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:28,034
Sheriff, can I talk to you
for one second? Please?

680
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:30,549
- Is that your photographer?
- Is that Sheriff?

681
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:33,479
Are you gonna print pictures now?

682
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:37,116
This story is about
to blow wide open, OK?

683
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:40,676
I found this story first,
I'm gonna print it first, period.

684
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:46,236
Your story could cost Lewis's life.
Do you understand that?

685
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:51,992
You give me three days - three days -
until the hearing is over, OK?

686
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:56,749
You promise me
that you will not talk to a soul

687
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:59,997
and that I have Lewis exclusively.

688
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:01,633
Exclusive.

689
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:05,071
You promise me
you're gonna hold off on the story.

690
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:08,875
Three days, Beth.

691
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:24,873
Slow down, driver.
You're making me nervous.

692
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:27,310
I'm sorry, sir. It's a bad habit I got.

693
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:30,796
I was all mellowed out
but you fucked that up.

694
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:34,196
I hope you're not gonna say
I can't smoke.

695
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:37,597
It's the only place left in town
you can smoke.

696
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:45,955
What the fuck are you doing?
Smoking crack?

697
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:50,392
Crack is for
our African-American brethren.

698
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:52,989
This is pure rock cocaine.

699
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:56,237
If you don't like it, driver,
you can raise the partition.

700
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:58,510
- I can?
- Whatever you want to do.

701
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:00,995
You want to see what I want to do?

702
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:04,636
Huh?

703
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:07,479
Cocksucker.

704
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:37,077
What do you want?

705
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,311
I want to see you.

706
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:44,677
OK.

707
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:10,876
What's happening here, Beth?

708
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:13,958
You tell me, Sheriff.

709
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:16,549
I'm not sure but I know that I just...

710
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:20,758
I can't take this any more.

711
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:23,520
So don't take it.

712
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:31,915
What do you want?

713
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:41,835
Oh, my God.

714
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:53,754
You're killing me, Beth.

715
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:55,916
I'm killing you?

716
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:00,950
You're killing me.

717
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:03,796
Sheriff?

718
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:08,479
Oh, shit.

719
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:10,989
Sheriff, are you there?

720
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:18,232
I was just gonna say
that I hope that, um...

721
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:23,750
you don't think last night was about...

722
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:30,513
Um... could you call me
when you get this message?

723
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:32,676
That'd be good. All right.

724
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,150
Can I sit next to you on the plane?

725
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:33,830
Hi, Tony. Tony?

726
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:36,838
- Hm?
- You all right?

727
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:41,270
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.
- Sure?

728
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:46,876
Do you wanna, um...
Do you want to switch with us?

729
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:50,959
- Yeah, do you want to switch seats?
- No, I like my seat. It's fine.

730
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:55,875
Sheriff, I'm a big boy.
I don't need somebody to hold my hand.

731
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:58,150
- OK.
- All right.

732
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:02,953
At least until we
get over the Philippines.

733
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:56,875
Come on, move it, man! Let's go!

734
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:58,957
- Whoo!
- Look out!

735
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:02,516
Woo-hoo! Yes!

736
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:34,072
Maybe we should all wash up,
meet in a half hour or so.

737
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:36,396
Fine with me.

738
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:41,118
- Is that cool with everyone?
- Yeah, it's fine.

739
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:44,555
- I'm right here.
- All right, man.

740
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:41,111
Hi.

741
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:39,032
Sheriff...

742
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:46,953
What's the matter? What's wrong?

743
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:52,630
Um...

744
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:54,990
What?

745
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:58,794
I'm gonna miss you.

746
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,719
I'm gonna miss you.

747
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:53,388
They won't bend.
Only one visitor allowed in there.

748
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:57,070
- One at a time?
- No, only one today.

749
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:59,794
- Oh, great.
- What do you want to do?

750
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,070
Do you mind
if I go back there and see him?

751
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:05,311
- No. No, you go.
- Are you sure?

752
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:08,557
Go ahead.

753
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:11,274
- Tell him I'll see him soon.
- OK.

754
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:16,117
Can you come back here?

755
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:32,437
I hear you.

756
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:23,711
Lew?

757
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:34,955
Lewis?

758
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:42,994
- Sheriff?
- Yeah.

759
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:46,629
Didn't they tell you I was coming?

760
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:49,274
I was praying.
I thought you were a dream

761
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:52,756
cos no prayer of mine's
ever been answered here before.

762
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:55,918
Yeah? I sure as hell ain't a dream.
I'll tell you that.

763
01:13:57,320 --> 01:13:59,550
It's good to see you.

764
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:02,149
- It's good to see you.
- You too!

765
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:06,114
- How are you, man?
- I'm better now.

766
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:09,471
That's good. That's good.

767
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:12,353
- How are you?
- I'm all right, man.

768
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:15,677
- You look good. Nice. Nice.
- Spiff on.

769
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:20,794
You've come so far. Are you thirsty?
Do you want some tea?

770
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:24,515
- I can make some tea.
- All right. Yeah. Let's have some tea.

771
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:27,996
- It's not warm or anything but...
- It's OK.

772
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:35,271
- You're not cold, are you?
- Nah, I'm not cold.

773
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:36,674
No?

774
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:39,474
Tony is here to see you too.
He's outside.

775
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:45,915
- You see, they took away my blanket.
- Why did they take your blanket away?

776
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:50,159
Cos they were scared that I was gonna
tear it into strips to hang myself.

777
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:54,035
I said, "Hey, guys, what do you think
I'm paying you for?"

778
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:02,195
Thank you, man. That's good tea.

779
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:06,954
I know why Tony didn't come in here.

780
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:11,472
I know. Cos there's no God in here.

781
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:14,114
They only let one visitor in at a time.

782
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:16,470
That's why I pray now, Sheriff.

783
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:19,592
I... Cos...

784
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:24,828
Out there there's no need to... to pray

785
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:28,510
where-where-where God's hand is felt.

786
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:32,679
You know? Where God is apparent?

787
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:37,752
But in here there's definitely a need

788
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:43,034
to-to pray, t-t-t-to beg,
to plead, to sing

789
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:46,596
for... for a sign like...

790
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:51,676
You know how... You know how...

791
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:55,839
how your voice sounds so pretty

792
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:58,270
in the shower?

793
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:02,075
Because... because
there's nothing else there.

794
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:05,955
Because it echoes off the walls
and it sounds so pretty.

795
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:10,472
That's why prayer sounds so perfect
in here.

796
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:16,313
Because it's so...
Because it's so totally empty.

797
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:19,956
Because it's so... it's so godless.

798
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:24,756
It's... It's so void of...
of anything.

799
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:31,433
And do you know how I know, Sheriff?
Do you know how I know?

800
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:34,590
I know because...

801
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:38,839
because I... I ask myself...

802
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:42,316
would I come back for you?

803
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:44,556
And the only answer

804
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:51,108
is a godless empty evil "No. "

805
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:54,471
I'm sorry
I wouldn't have come back!

806
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:59,031
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be. It's OK.

807
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:03,392
Because I didn't come back just for you.

808
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:06,956
I didn't come back just for you,
you know?

809
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:10,630
It's all right. Man, it's OK.

810
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:12,910
Do you know what I mean? Come here.

811
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:15,190
It's OK.

812
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,595
- OK, man.
- OK.

813
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:33,468
I'm gonna see you in a couple hours,
all right? All right?

814
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:36,353
Thanks for the tea. I liked that.

815
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:40,155
See you in a couple of hours.
You'll be cleaned up. It'll be good.

816
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:46,153
Sheriff.

817
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:48,078
Yeah?

818
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:52,994
I knew you'd come back.

819
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:55,919
Even if you didn't.

820
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:01,990
Thank you.

821
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:28,391
So how bad was it?

822
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:36,474
I don't know. I don't know
how bad it was. It was not good.

823
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:39,433
What wasn't good, the prison or Lewis?

824
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:44,236
The prison sucks, for sure. It's dirty,
it's scary, it's third-world.

825
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:46,829
How's Lewis? Is he sick?

826
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:50,271
Is he all there mentally?
Is he the same guy we used to know?

827
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:52,436
I don't think he's lost his mind,

828
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:55,438
but it's not easy sitting around a cell
waiting to hang.

829
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:59,235
Yeah. What did he say?
Did he tell you anything?

830
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:01,954
He just babbled a little bit, Tone.

831
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:04,628
You know, like,
rambled a little bit, you know?

832
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:06,751
Like stream-of-consciousness stuff.

833
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:10,350
God's not in here.
There's no God in here.

834
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:13,199
The sound's beautiful,
like singing in the shower.

835
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:15,675
Basically you're saying he lost it.

836
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:18,235
He's hanging onto anything
he possibly can.

837
01:19:18,440 --> 01:19:21,113
- No one's questioning his courage.
- But his sanity?

838
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:25,359
You want a way out? Find one.
But Lewis has always talked that way.

839
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:32,194
How do... What do you mean, always?

840
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:35,472
You're only his lawyer.
You've known him for two years.

841
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:42,556
24 years.

842
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:48,516
- I'm his sister.
- What?

843
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:57,475
He's my baby brother.

844
01:20:22,160 --> 01:20:24,515
Why didn't you tell me?

845
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:28,318
I thought you wouldn't trust me,
Sheriff.

846
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:32,751
I thought you'd think
I'd do anything, that I'd say...

847
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:35,793
say anything,
that I'd sell you out, that I'd...

848
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:41,836
I wanted to... I wanted to tell you.
I tried to tell you.

849
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:45,475
But you didn't tell me.

850
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:49,314
But you didn't tell me.

851
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:20,351
Sheriff?

852
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,116
What are we still doing here?

853
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:35,516
I wish it was that simple, Tony.

854
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:37,950
I think it's that simple.

855
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:41,197
I came back here based on
what she told me, OK,

856
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:44,153
and she gave me her word and she lied.

857
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:48,070
How are we going to trust her, Sheriff?

858
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:56,029
She drags us into this nightmare, we
find out it is her personal nightmare.

859
01:21:56,240 --> 01:22:00,472
A woman we don't know from Adam.
I don't know her. You don't know her.

860
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:03,956
- What?
- I know her.

861
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:07,516
Like, know her.

862
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:11,791
Don't even... Don't.

863
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:15,196
Fuck.

864
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:17,675
All right, I'm an asshole.

865
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:23,034
No, Tony.
This time I'm the fucking asshole.

866
01:22:23,240 --> 01:22:25,231
Why didn't you tell me?

867
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:29,752
What do I owe you to tell you that? It's
not like it's been going on forever.

868
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:32,520
- It happened.
- Listen to me...

869
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:36,474
Don't make it like I'm holding out
on you because I swear to God I'm not.

870
01:22:36,680 --> 01:22:39,990
All right. Listen to me, Sheriff.

871
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:45,115
This girl will do anything to get you
to do what she needs you to, all right?

872
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:47,356
That's her brother in there. Her blood.

873
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:51,712
She'll lie to you, she'll sleep with
you, she'll tell you she loves you.

874
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:54,992
She'll do anything. She'll get down
on her knees and beg you.

875
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:57,589
But don't believe it. It's a setup.

876
01:22:58,760 --> 01:23:01,718
If we walk out of here, that boy hangs.

877
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:04,798
And if we stay maybe we hang.
But if we leave, we live.

878
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:08,072
That's the one thing
I know for sure right now.

879
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:20,835
He doesn't have clothes?

880
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:24,874
Can't you give him a shower
before he turns up in court?

881
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:28,953
OK. Listen. I...

882
01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:41,313
What can I do for you, sir?

883
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:45,308
We need two seats on any flight
to New York, as fast as possible.

884
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,230
What, Sheriff? What is it?

885
01:25:07,160 --> 01:25:09,628
I trashed that bike, Tony.

886
01:25:10,760 --> 01:25:13,638
So fucking what?
Get on the plane, Sheriff.

887
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:16,479
Do you want to rot
in one of these prisons?

888
01:25:17,640 --> 01:25:21,428
- I'm gonna take my chances, Tony.
- You don't have any chances, Sheriff.

889
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:24,313
Don't leave your life to fate.
This is stupid.

890
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:28,034
I don't know, Tony.

891
01:25:38,240 --> 01:25:40,674
You have a safe flight.

892
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:26,439
- What's he saying?
- He says they returned

893
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:28,835
but became frightened and may have left.

894
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:32,237
We request adjournment
till the two can be found.

895
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:41,268
Um... he's worried about the appearance
of preferential treatment.

896
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:28,789
Hey, Lew. How are you?

897
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,878
My faith in humanity
is half restored.

898
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:36,756
In returning voluntarily, you are
to be commended for your courage.

899
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:40,430
Is there anything you wish to say
to this court, Mr Volgecherev?

900
01:27:45,480 --> 01:27:47,789
Not really, Your Honour.

901
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:52,152
Just that we were young and stupid,
I guess.

902
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:55,272
But not evil.

903
01:27:55,480 --> 01:27:58,517
I didn't come back here today
because I'm courageous.

904
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:03,470
I came back here because
I've been careless for a very long time,

905
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:05,796
and I'm sick of that feeling.

906
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:10,908
The simple fact, Your Honour,
is that I am responsible.

907
01:28:12,240 --> 01:28:14,595
And I'm also scared.

908
01:28:16,240 --> 01:28:19,312
But I am willing to do
whatever is necessary...

909
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:24,153
in order for you
to spare my friend's life.

910
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:31,671
How do you plead?

911
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:34,075
I'm guilty.

912
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:39,878
You will be detained in Penang Prison
to await sentence.

913
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:16,157
He asked the prosecutor
if he will now reduce the charges.

914
01:29:22,240 --> 01:29:24,470
The prosecutor has agreed.

915
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:44,115
Chief Justice will be back
shortly with his decision.

916
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:05,831
Beth?

917
01:30:07,240 --> 01:30:09,754
We're back in session.

918
01:30:09,960 --> 01:30:12,110
- We're back?
- Yeah.

919
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:42,396
The Deputy Home Minister is angered
about some international news story.

920
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:44,955
I'm not sure what.

921
01:30:51,640 --> 01:30:54,996
<i>A story that was picked up
by the Asian International Tribune.</i>

922
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:59,671
"In a country proud of its many species
of exotic butterflies,

923
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:02,474
a butterfly is
about to be broken on a wheel. "

924
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:05,749
"The wheel is Malaysian justice,

925
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:10,238
a term which strikes one American woman
as a cruel joke. "

926
01:31:10,440 --> 01:31:13,113
- Your Honour...
- "The woman is Beth McBride... "

927
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:15,993
- I didn't do this.
- "... whose brother was arrested

928
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:18,634
two years ago in Penang. "

929
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:22,071
"Blamed for having bought
hashish with two friends,

930
01:31:22,280 --> 01:31:27,035
this nature-loving young man now,
incredibly, faces death. "

931
01:31:27,240 --> 01:31:30,835
- She was determined to write the story.
- Silence!

932
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:35,588
We know you westerners don't understand
our attitude toward drugs.

933
01:31:35,800 --> 01:31:37,870
But we don't understand yours.

934
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:42,471
Your cities are decaying, the souls of
your young people are stolen from you.

935
01:31:43,640 --> 01:31:47,952
Our laws may seem harsh but our streets
remain safe and our youth is protected.

936
01:31:48,160 --> 01:31:52,551
So when an American journalist
criticises ourjudicial system...

937
01:31:52,760 --> 01:31:57,197
- Your Honour, I begged her not to.
- Silence!

938
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:02,551
Lewis McBride...

939
01:32:07,960 --> 01:32:09,791
What is he saying?

940
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:17,433
What is he saying?

941
01:32:17,640 --> 01:32:22,475
He will not amend the charge now.
Lewis must be hanged tomorrow.

942
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:27,552
What? Lewis!

943
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:30,399
Your Honour, I came back here.
You can't hang him!

944
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:39,838
- You hang on, Lewis!
- Beth, I love you!

945
01:32:40,040 --> 01:32:43,749
Get your fucking hands off me.
What is the matter with you people?

946
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:46,713
What is the matter with you people?

947
01:32:46,920 --> 01:32:49,832
You are gonna go straight to hell,
you motherfucker!

948
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:52,873
You lying son of a bitch!

949
01:32:53,080 --> 01:32:55,469
Goddamn it! Sheriff!

950
01:34:27,880 --> 01:34:30,519
I don't wanna die! No!

951
01:34:30,720 --> 01:34:32,711
You fucking bastards!

952
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:40,872
I don't wanna die! Help!

953
01:34:41,080 --> 01:34:43,833
Lewis. Lewis!

954
01:34:44,040 --> 01:34:46,395
Lewis!

955
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:49,398
Please let go of me!

956
01:34:55,680 --> 01:34:58,592
You fucking bastards!

957
01:35:20,680 --> 01:35:22,716
No! No!

958
01:35:31,880 --> 01:35:34,155
Lew! Lewis!

959
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:42,797
Lewis!

960
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:46,117
Lewis! Lewis, goddamn it! Look up here!

961
01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:49,357
- Sheriff!
- I'm here, Lewis!

962
01:35:49,560 --> 01:35:51,551
I'm right here!

963
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:53,512
You're not alone, Lewis!

964
01:35:57,840 --> 01:36:00,149
Look at me, Lewis!

965
01:36:00,360 --> 01:36:03,397
You're not alone, Lewis.
Look at me. You're not alone.

966
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:06,512
I'm here. Look at me. See me, Lewis.

967
01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:09,951
You're not alone. I'm right here.

968
01:36:10,160 --> 01:36:12,515
I'm right here, Lewis.

969
01:36:12,720 --> 01:36:15,075
I see you, Lewis. I'm right here.

970
01:36:15,280 --> 01:36:18,113
Lewis, you are not alone right now.
I'm right here.

971
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:20,959
You are not alone, Lewis. I see you.

972
01:36:21,160 --> 01:36:23,594
I see you, Lewis. I'm here.
You're not alone.

973
01:36:24,520 --> 01:36:26,988
You are not alone, Lewis!

974
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:13,030
Right. OK.

975
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:26,354
Where am I going here?

976
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:14,513
Beth.

977
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:27,315
- Were you there?
- Yeah.

978
01:38:29,080 --> 01:38:31,310
He wasn't afraid, Beth.

979
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:35,830
He walked right past me.

980
01:38:36,040 --> 01:38:40,511
And then I saw him go past
all the guards and he was calm.

981
01:38:40,720 --> 01:38:45,748
Come on, Sheriff. Tell me the truth.

982
01:38:45,960 --> 01:38:49,316
It was hard. It was hard. But, uh...

983
01:38:50,920 --> 01:38:53,309
You know, I think that, uh...

984
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:58,999
he found, at the end, Beth,
at the end...

985
01:39:01,880 --> 01:39:04,474
I mean, he was Lewis, you know?

986
01:39:05,800 --> 01:39:08,394
At that last second,

987
01:39:08,600 --> 01:39:11,478
I swear to God,

988
01:39:11,680 --> 01:39:13,830
he was at peace with everything.

989
01:39:15,040 --> 01:39:17,076
He was.

990
01:39:21,240 --> 01:39:24,312
I just wish I could have done something.

991
01:39:24,520 --> 01:39:28,718
If I could have been there
to do something. Fight harder.

992
01:39:28,920 --> 01:39:32,230
You did everything you could.
Nobody could have done more.

993
01:39:32,440 --> 01:39:35,512
You've gotta believe that.
Nobody did more than you did.

994
01:39:37,160 --> 01:39:39,276
Nobody could have done more.

995
01:39:39,480 --> 01:39:42,950
- You did everything you could.
- You should have gone back with Tony.

996
01:39:43,160 --> 01:39:45,116
Why didn't you go back with Tony?

997
01:39:46,760 --> 01:39:49,320
I couldn't go back with Tony.

998
01:39:51,240 --> 01:39:56,473
I couldn't go back because
I knew that you were waiting for me.

999
01:39:56,680 --> 01:40:00,719
And I'm not sorry, Beth.
I'm not sorry right now. I'm not.

1000
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:05,909
Cos if I would have went back,

1001
01:40:06,120 --> 01:40:09,908
I don't think I'd be able
to look at you ever again.

1002
01:40:13,680 --> 01:40:17,229
And that'd be a lot harder
than this shit.

1003
01:40:17,440 --> 01:40:19,670
You know what I mean?

1004
01:40:19,880 --> 01:40:22,599
I like to look at you.

1005
01:40:24,840 --> 01:40:27,673
I like to look at you.

1006
01:40:29,120 --> 01:40:32,237
I like to look at you.

1007
01:40:36,360 --> 01:40:39,318
The ambassador heard
through back channels

1008
01:40:41,680 --> 01:40:44,274
that when all this publicity dies down,

1009
01:40:45,560 --> 01:40:47,755
they're gonna let you go, Sheriff.

1010
01:40:47,960 --> 01:40:50,474
They're gonna do it quietly
to save face,

1011
01:40:50,680 --> 01:40:53,877
but it's gonna be six months,
maximum.

1012
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:57,396
Sheriff?

1013
01:40:57,600 --> 01:40:58,749
Yeah.

1014
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:04,512
Oh, goddamn it! Oh, goddamn it!

1015
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:27,315
Sheriff.
I am gonna take my brother home...

1016
01:41:29,160 --> 01:41:31,390
and I'm coming right back here.

1017
01:41:31,600 --> 01:41:36,196
And I will not leave Penang
until you're with me.

1018
01:41:39,120 --> 01:41:41,998
I know, Beth. I know.
