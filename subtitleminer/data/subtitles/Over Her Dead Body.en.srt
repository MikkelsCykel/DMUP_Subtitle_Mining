00:01:41,756 --> 00:01:43,656
# We came to make it hotter #

7
00:01:43,725 --> 00:01:46,091
# We beat the party starters #

8
00:01:46,161 --> 00:01:48,129
# Bubblin' up just like lava #

9
00:01:48,196 --> 00:01:50,721
# Like lava,
heat it like a sauna #

10
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,233
# Penetrate
into your body armor #

11
00:01:53,301 --> 00:01:55,462
# Rhythmically we massage ya #

12
00:01:55,537 --> 00:01:57,732
# With hip-hop mixed up
with samba #

13
00:01:57,806 --> 00:01:59,535
# With samba
So yes, yes, y'all #

00:01:59,607 --> 00:02:00,574
# Yes, y'all, y'all #

# You know we never stop,
we never rest, y'all #

16
00:02:01,843 --> 00:02:02,810
# Rest, y'all, y'all #

17
00:02:02,877 --> 00:02:04,276
# We can keep it
funky fresh, y'all #

18
00:02:04,345 --> 00:02:05,369
# Fresh, y'all, y'all #

19
00:02:05,447 --> 00:02:07,210
# And we won't stop

# Oba oba oba #

23
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:19,483
# Yo, Peter Piper
picked peppers #

24
00:02:19,561 --> 00:02:20,892
# But Tab rocked ryhmes #

25
00:02:20,962 --> 00:02:22,431
- # On one two, three,
four, several times #

26
00:02:22,432 --> 00:02:22,953
- Oh, Miss. Miss.

27
00:02:23,031 --> 00:02:25,158
We have a lot
of vegetarians...

28
00:02:25,233 --> 00:02:27,827
so I wanna make sure every tray
has a vegetarian item...

29
00:02:27,902 --> 00:02:29,927
and a non-vegetarian item.
Got it?

30
00:02:30,004 --> 00:02:31,801
And they can't touch. Okay?

31
00:02:31,873 --> 00:02:33,738
And if you run out of either,
go back and refill.

32
00:02:33,808 --> 00:02:35,776
Don't just circulate with one.
Got it?

33
00:02:35,844 --> 00:02:37,471
And if you get the feeling
one is running out faster...

34
00:02:37,545 --> 00:02:39,012
than the other,
then just load the trays...

35
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,047
according to that ratio.

36
00:02:40,114 --> 00:02:41,081
You got it?

37
00:02:41,149 --> 00:02:42,116
Okay, what else?

38
00:02:42,183 --> 00:02:43,150
- Hey!
- Um... Ooh!

39
00:02:43,218 --> 00:02:45,277
It's your wedding day. Relax.

40
00:02:45,353 --> 00:02:46,786
Hey.

41
00:02:46,855 --> 00:02:49,187
I find a little stress
goes a long way.

42
00:02:49,257 --> 00:02:52,283
If I worry now, then
I can relax during the ceremony.

43
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,692
You're not gonna relax
during the ceremony.

44
00:02:54,762 --> 00:02:56,161
You're right.

45
00:02:56,231 --> 00:02:57,220
You should, though.

46
00:02:57,298 --> 00:02:58,322
It's gonna be perfect.

47
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,767
It's really coming together,
isn't it?

48
00:03:01,669 --> 00:03:04,297
You know,
I think we should probab...

49
00:03:04,372 --> 00:03:05,669
What in the heck?

50
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:08,406
Well, hello, little lady.

51
00:03:08,476 --> 00:03:10,341
What can I do for you?

52
00:03:10,411 --> 00:03:11,708
What the hell is this?

53
00:03:11,779 --> 00:03:13,178
Why, it's the angel...

54
00:03:13,248 --> 00:03:14,840
just like your ordered.

55
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:17,384
No, but she doesn't have wings.

56
00:03:17,452 --> 00:03:19,147
Yeah. So?

57
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:21,552
So angels have wings.

58
00:03:21,623 --> 00:03:23,215
This is just a lady.

59
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:26,158
No. No, no, no.
It's... It's an angel.

60
00:03:26,227 --> 00:03:28,923
See, beautiful,
all-knowing smile...

61
00:03:28,997 --> 00:03:33,127
eyes that have seen
a thousand eternities... angel.

62
00:03:34,269 --> 00:03:37,432
Chloe, do angels have wings?

63
00:03:38,172 --> 00:03:39,139
Sometimes?

64
00:03:39,207 --> 00:03:40,174
Always!

65
00:03:40,241 --> 00:03:43,677
That's the difference between
a person and an angel: wings.

66
00:03:43,745 --> 00:03:45,440
Why do angels
have to have wings?

67
00:03:45,513 --> 00:03:46,946
So they can fly.

68
00:03:47,015 --> 00:03:48,607
No, but angels are magical.

69
00:03:48,683 --> 00:03:50,241
They don't need wings to fly.

70
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:51,808
What, does God have wings?

71
00:03:51,886 --> 00:03:55,378
Okay, I'm not gonna stand here
and debate theology with you.

72
00:03:55,456 --> 00:03:58,289
So just take it back
and bring me one with wings.

73
00:03:58,359 --> 00:04:00,520
All right, no.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, little miss.

74
00:04:00,595 --> 00:04:02,256
This is a ice sculpture.

75
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:05,265
I sculpted it out of ice,
then it melts...

76
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,597
and I don't have a lot of them
just lyin' around.

77
00:04:07,669 --> 00:04:10,160
So sculpt some wings
and stick them on. I don't care.

78
00:04:10,238 --> 00:04:12,103
This isn't what I ordered,
and I'm not accepting it.

79
00:04:12,173 --> 00:04:14,198
- Yeah. But I...
- Tut-tut-tut, take it back.

80
00:04:16,077 --> 00:04:17,772
I made an angel.

81
00:04:18,346 --> 00:04:19,438
Oh, yoo-hoo.

82
00:04:19,514 --> 00:04:20,947
Oh, not done with you.

83
00:04:21,015 --> 00:04:22,243
Not so fast.

84
00:04:22,317 --> 00:04:23,944
Um, did you get
the appetizers down?

85
00:04:24,018 --> 00:04:25,212
Do I need
to go through it again?

86
00:04:25,286 --> 00:04:26,480
No.

87
00:04:26,554 --> 00:04:28,784
Are you nodding to signal yes,
or is your neck broken?

88
00:04:28,856 --> 00:04:30,653
Oh, yes, appetizers. Yes.

89
00:04:30,725 --> 00:04:31,885
Dinner.

90
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,949
I want this on a schedule.

91
00:04:33,027 --> 00:04:34,392
So I want you to get
the salads down...

92
00:04:34,462 --> 00:04:37,625
even if the people aren't...
My gardenias!

93
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:38,666
Your what?

94
00:04:38,733 --> 00:04:39,961
- Stop! You're gonna run over...
- Doesn't seem to be a reason...

95
00:04:40,034 --> 00:04:41,626
- my gardenias!
- why we didn't do that.

96
00:04:41,703 --> 00:04:44,001
You idiot! Stop your truck!

97
00:04:44,072 --> 00:04:45,664
I'm just doing what
I'm supposed to be doing. I...

98
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,002
- Stop the truck!
- Huh?

99
00:04:47,075 --> 00:04:48,099
Stop!

100
00:04:48,176 --> 00:04:50,235
- What are you talkin' about?
- Stop the truck!

101
00:04:50,311 --> 00:04:51,972
- Stop!
- Oh!

102
00:04:55,316 --> 00:04:56,340
Huh?

103
00:05:15,103 --> 00:05:16,070
Who the hell are you?

104
00:05:16,137 --> 00:05:17,900
Kate, I know this must be...

105
00:05:17,972 --> 00:05:19,439
That idiot with the truck!

106
00:05:19,507 --> 00:05:20,565
I'm gonna kill him.

107
00:05:20,642 --> 00:05:22,109
I'm gonna sue him,
and then I'm gonna kill him!

108
00:05:22,176 --> 00:05:23,143
What time is it?

109
00:05:23,211 --> 00:05:24,542
That's not really important
right now.

110
00:05:24,612 --> 00:05:25,601
Don't tell me what's important.

111
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,669
I'm getting married today.

112
00:05:26,748 --> 00:05:28,010
No, you're not.

113
00:05:28,082 --> 00:05:29,572
How long
have I been unconscious?

114
00:05:29,651 --> 00:05:30,845
- What kind of hospital is this?
- Will you please stop...

115
00:05:30,918 --> 00:05:32,442
interrupting and just listen.

116
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,987
Look, my insurance pays
your salary...

117
00:05:34,055 --> 00:05:36,250
so if I want some information,
just do me the courtesy...

118
00:05:36,324 --> 00:05:37,586
Will you shut up? You're dead!

119
00:05:40,028 --> 00:05:41,461
Is that some kind of sick joke?

120
00:05:41,529 --> 00:05:42,860
Look around you.
There are no walls.

121
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:43,954
Hello?
Where do you think you are?

122
00:05:44,032 --> 00:05:45,090
Okay, you were crushed to death.

123
00:05:46,501 --> 00:05:48,059
I'm sorry. I lost my cool.

124
00:05:48,136 --> 00:05:49,433
I don't usually do that.

125
00:05:49,937 --> 00:05:50,904
I'm dead?

126
00:05:50,972 --> 00:05:52,200
I'm sorry.

127
00:05:52,273 --> 00:05:53,501
Now, we don't have much time.

128
00:05:53,574 --> 00:05:55,007
- Is this heaven?
- Not exactly.

129
00:05:55,076 --> 00:05:57,067
- Hell?
- No. Just listen, please.

130
00:05:57,145 --> 00:05:58,612
There are some important things
for you to know.

131
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,170
Well, who are you?

132
00:06:00,248 --> 00:06:01,738
I'm an angel.

133
00:06:07,255 --> 00:06:08,552
Who put you up to this?

134
00:06:08,623 --> 00:06:09,590
Put me up to what?

135
00:06:09,657 --> 00:06:12,023
For the last damn time,
angels have wings.

136
00:06:12,093 --> 00:06:13,492
Wings!

137
00:06:14,829 --> 00:06:16,194
Oh, my God, you're disappearing.

138
00:06:16,264 --> 00:06:17,595
That's not good. I'm sorry.

139
00:06:17,665 --> 00:06:20,998
You were saying something
about important information?

140
00:06:21,069 --> 00:06:22,559
Wait! Don't go!

141
00:06:22,637 --> 00:06:24,400
Hello?

142
00:06:24,472 --> 00:06:25,734
Hello?!

143
00:06:29,944 --> 00:06:31,002
Crap!

144
00:06:32,714 --> 00:06:34,477
It's coming in clearer now.

145
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:38,112
Definitely, coming in clearer.

146
00:06:41,355 --> 00:06:42,379
A boat.

147
00:06:43,891 --> 00:06:45,882
He left the money on your boat.

148
00:06:47,095 --> 00:06:49,063
We didn't have a boat.

149
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:50,154
No boat?

150
00:06:56,404 --> 00:06:57,428
Hold on.

151
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,668
I'm getting something.

152
00:07:03,711 --> 00:07:05,440
- You're sure you didn't have a boat?
- No boat.

153
00:07:05,513 --> 00:07:06,673
Maybe he had a boat
that you didn't know about.

154
00:07:06,748 --> 00:07:07,976
He was afraid of the water.

155
00:07:08,049 --> 00:07:09,346
A boot?

156
00:07:11,119 --> 00:07:12,143
Probably not?

157
00:07:13,488 --> 00:07:15,251
Let me see
if something else comes in.

158
00:07:16,724 --> 00:07:17,713
Do you hear that, too?

159
00:07:17,792 --> 00:07:18,952
Yeah, I do.

160
00:07:19,026 --> 00:07:20,653
Is it from beyond?
Is that a message?

161
00:07:20,728 --> 00:07:22,628
No. I think it's my smoke alarm.

162
00:07:22,697 --> 00:07:24,062
Can you excuse me a second,
Mary?

163
00:07:25,767 --> 00:07:27,530
Oh, God! Oh, no!

164
00:07:27,602 --> 00:07:29,069
Oh, no!

165
00:07:29,137 --> 00:07:30,104
What, what, what?

166
00:07:30,171 --> 00:07:31,433
- What is it?
- Uh, no, everything's fine.

167
00:07:31,506 --> 00:07:32,473
No, no, no.
It's under control.

168
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,507
- It's just a little, uh...
- What is that?

169
00:07:33,574 --> 00:07:34,541
Just a little smoky, that's all.

170
00:07:34,609 --> 00:07:35,115
Oh, God. Move.

171
00:07:35,116 --> 00:07:36,600
It's the thing in that
silver pan that burned.

172
00:07:36,677 --> 00:07:37,644
The osso bucco.

173
00:07:37,712 --> 00:07:39,179
I-I-I don't know.
Does the name matter?

174
00:07:39,247 --> 00:07:40,305
It's on fire.

175
00:07:40,381 --> 00:07:42,212
God, Dan,
you're like the worst cook ever.

176
00:07:42,283 --> 00:07:43,511
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Get the crab

177
00:07:43,584 --> 00:07:44,551
What are you...
Can you...

178
00:07:44,619 --> 00:07:45,586
I'm just... It's smoking.

179
00:07:45,653 --> 00:07:46,620
Can you...
Well, how's the crab dip going?

180
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:48,086
Crab dip is going great.
Oh, no, no.

181
00:07:48,156 --> 00:07:50,522
The crab dip is going
spectacularly well.

182
00:07:50,591 --> 00:07:51,888
That's the thing
in the little red bowl, right?

183
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:53,241
Yes. Can you just
chop something, please?

184
00:07:53,242 --> 00:07:53,824
Chopping, chopping.

185
00:07:54,729 --> 00:07:56,356
Oh, God, Dan.

186
00:08:03,004 --> 00:08:04,266
You know, as much as
I love you hovering around...

187
00:08:04,338 --> 00:08:06,397
and watching me while I work,
how's the reading going?

188
00:08:06,474 --> 00:08:08,408
- Oh, the reading. The reading.
- Okay.

189
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:10,634
I'm back.

190
00:08:10,711 --> 00:08:12,178
Listen, I gotta run.

191
00:08:12,246 --> 00:08:13,213
Oh, really?

192
00:08:13,281 --> 00:08:14,373
Sorry about that, Mary.

193
00:08:14,448 --> 00:08:16,143
- I just...
- Oh, no. You did good.

194
00:08:16,217 --> 00:08:17,548
- Really?
- Absolutely.

195
00:08:17,618 --> 00:08:19,108
Maybe we have a boat
I forgot about.

196
00:08:19,187 --> 00:08:20,381
- Yeah. I mean, you know...
- Yeah.

197
00:08:20,454 --> 00:08:21,716
And remember, no...

198
00:08:21,789 --> 00:08:23,518
- driving on Mondays.
- Driving on Mondays.

199
00:08:23,591 --> 00:08:25,582
Right? Be careful.

200
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:26,684
Bye.

201
00:08:28,162 --> 00:08:29,129
Okay, Dan.

202
00:08:29,197 --> 00:08:30,186
Why aren't you chopping?

203
00:08:30,264 --> 00:08:31,629
Hmm? Oh, small cut.

204
00:08:31,699 --> 00:08:32,961
- What?
- It's fine. It's tiny. It's all good.

205
00:08:33,034 --> 00:08:34,126
- Really?
- Yeah. And most of the blood...

206
00:08:34,202 --> 00:08:36,102
went into the tomato sauce,
so who's gonna know?

207
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:38,866
Dan, look, I'm sorry
for leaving you alone.

208
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,100
It's so unfair.

209
00:08:40,174 --> 00:08:42,472
You have my complete,
undivided attention now, okay?

210
00:08:46,781 --> 00:08:48,874
Stir the béarnaise sauce
before it separates, all right?

211
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:50,042
You got it. Oh, béarnaise...

212
00:08:50,117 --> 00:08:51,141
No, actually,
I know what that one is.

213
00:08:51,219 --> 00:08:52,743
- Good.
- Yeah, we're good. We're good.

214
00:08:58,226 --> 00:08:59,250
Damn it.

215
00:09:00,695 --> 00:09:01,662
- Hi.
- Hi.

216
00:09:01,729 --> 00:09:03,492
I'm Chloe.
I'm a friend of Beth's.

217
00:09:03,564 --> 00:09:05,464
She gave me your address
and told me to stop by.

218
00:09:05,533 --> 00:09:07,797
- Yeah. Hi.
- Hi. How are you?

219
00:09:07,869 --> 00:09:08,893
Beth. God, how is she?

220
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:10,597
Ah, you know,
still with the drummer.

221
00:09:10,671 --> 00:09:12,138
You are kidding me.
That guy is a mess.

222
00:09:12,206 --> 00:09:13,434
I thought they totally broke up.

223
00:09:13,507 --> 00:09:15,372
Which time? I think, it's
been like five times already.

224
00:09:15,443 --> 00:09:17,138
Do you know that girl Colleen,
who he used to date?

225
00:09:17,211 --> 00:09:18,371
- Do you know Colleen?
- Yeah.

226
00:09:18,446 --> 00:09:19,936
- Have we met before?
- You look really familiar.

227
00:09:20,014 --> 00:09:21,345
That's so weird, 'cause
when you opened the door...

228
00:09:21,415 --> 00:09:22,712
- I was like, "I think I know that girl."
- Yeah.

229
00:09:22,783 --> 00:09:23,750
That's so funny.

230
00:09:23,818 --> 00:09:25,251
Oh, man.

231
00:09:25,319 --> 00:09:26,946
Uh... sorry.

232
00:09:27,021 --> 00:09:28,215
This is my brother, Henry.

233
00:09:28,289 --> 00:09:29,256
Hi.

234
00:09:29,323 --> 00:09:30,290
He needs your help.

235
00:09:30,358 --> 00:09:31,848
I don't know about that.

236
00:09:31,926 --> 00:09:33,086
You promised.

237
00:09:33,761 --> 00:09:35,228
Well, come on in.

238
00:09:37,965 --> 00:09:39,728
Wow. God, Beth.

239
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,290
Haven't heard her name...

240
00:09:41,369 --> 00:09:42,427
long time.

241
00:09:42,503 --> 00:09:44,733
Um, how can I help you?

242
00:09:47,174 --> 00:09:48,436
I don't know if you can.

243
00:09:49,377 --> 00:09:52,244
Henry's fiancée passed away
about a year ago...

244
00:09:52,313 --> 00:09:54,281
on their wedding day.

245
00:09:54,348 --> 00:09:56,145
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

246
00:09:56,217 --> 00:09:57,343
Thank you.

247
00:09:57,418 --> 00:09:58,783
I hope you don't mind me asking,
but how, um...

248
00:09:58,853 --> 00:09:59,877
How did it happen?

249
00:10:00,988 --> 00:10:02,546
She was crushed by an angel...

250
00:10:03,658 --> 00:10:06,149
and as sad as I am,
I do appreciate the irony.

251
00:10:07,361 --> 00:10:09,295
And, well, he's just...

252
00:10:09,363 --> 00:10:10,762
He's not moving on.

253
00:10:10,831 --> 00:10:12,230
I don't think that's so unusual.

254
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,494
You've changed.

255
00:10:13,567 --> 00:10:14,795
You don't smile.

256
00:10:14,869 --> 00:10:16,769
You don't leave your apartment.

257
00:10:16,837 --> 00:10:17,929
I like my apartment.

258
00:10:18,005 --> 00:10:19,836
Nobody hassles me
if I don't smile there.

259
00:10:20,508 --> 00:10:22,442
He's not letting go,
and I was just thinking...

260
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:26,207
that maybe if he communicated
with his fiancée, Kate...

261
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,908
that, um, maybe she would,
you know...

262
00:10:28,983 --> 00:10:31,679
convince him that it's okay
for him to move on in his life.

263
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:33,946
Is that what you want?

264
00:10:34,021 --> 00:10:35,420
That's what she wants.

265
00:10:35,489 --> 00:10:36,786
And once she gets an idea
in her head...

266
00:10:36,857 --> 00:10:38,290
it's best to just...

267
00:10:38,359 --> 00:10:40,884
I'm here, so, you know.

268
00:10:42,029 --> 00:10:44,293
Okay. All right.

269
00:10:44,365 --> 00:10:46,128
Well, let's give it a shot.

270
00:10:47,501 --> 00:10:50,527
Um, how do you get
into all of this?

271
00:10:50,604 --> 00:10:51,696
Oh, what?
You mean, like being a psychic?

272
00:10:51,772 --> 00:10:52,739
Yeah.

273
00:10:52,807 --> 00:10:54,035
Why? You think it's crap?

274
00:10:54,775 --> 00:10:56,003
No. I keep an open mind.

275
00:10:56,077 --> 00:10:58,136
I mean, there are plenty
of things people can't explain.

276
00:10:58,212 --> 00:10:59,338
You can be honest.

277
00:11:00,214 --> 00:11:02,478
Not crap, just unproven...

278
00:11:03,384 --> 00:11:06,012
after hundreds of years
and thousands of studies.

279
00:11:07,355 --> 00:11:08,583
But you're keeping an open mind.

280
00:11:08,656 --> 00:11:09,680
Isn't it obvious?

281
00:11:12,093 --> 00:11:13,651
Well, what do you do
for a living?

282
00:11:13,728 --> 00:11:16,219
- I'm a vet.
- So a man of science?

283
00:11:16,297 --> 00:11:17,958
I suppose I am.

284
00:11:18,032 --> 00:11:19,158
Do you believe in heaven?

285
00:11:20,001 --> 00:11:21,195
Jury's out.

286
00:11:21,869 --> 00:11:23,302
Wow.

287
00:11:23,371 --> 00:11:25,771
See, that's just...
That's depressing to me.

288
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,899
I mean, what a sad and
hopeless world it would be...

289
00:11:27,975 --> 00:11:29,602
if that was the case.

290
00:11:29,677 --> 00:11:32,737
I really believe that the people
we love never really leave us.

291
00:11:32,813 --> 00:11:35,338
You know, they're...
They're always watchin' over us.

292
00:11:35,983 --> 00:11:38,543
And then, sometimes,
if we're lucky...

293
00:11:38,619 --> 00:11:40,177
we get to talk to them.

294
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:43,616
So have you had
a lot of luck with this?

295
00:11:43,691 --> 00:11:45,056
Sometimes yes, sometimes no.

296
00:11:45,126 --> 00:11:46,354
I know that's
not very scientific...

297
00:11:46,427 --> 00:11:47,416
but when it works...

298
00:11:47,495 --> 00:11:49,224
it really does
make people happy.

299
00:11:52,433 --> 00:11:53,491
You wanna give it a go?

300
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:57,369
Okay. Give me your hands.

301
00:11:58,339 --> 00:11:59,704
Does this cost extra?

302
00:11:59,774 --> 00:12:02,675
Do you always use humor to cope
with uncomfortable situations?

303
00:12:02,743 --> 00:12:05,234
That reminds of this time
two rabbis walked into a bar.

304
00:12:05,312 --> 00:12:07,837
All right.
Come on, give me your hands.

305
00:12:09,884 --> 00:12:12,284
Now, just think about the person
you're trying to contact.

306
00:12:13,621 --> 00:12:15,885
I am getting something, um,
but it's...

307
00:12:15,956 --> 00:12:16,980
But it's a man.

308
00:12:17,825 --> 00:12:21,784
He's in a, like, a blue suit
or, um, like a uniform.

309
00:12:21,862 --> 00:12:23,989
My father wore blue suits.

310
00:12:24,065 --> 00:12:25,032
He was a lawyer.

311
00:12:25,099 --> 00:12:26,464
Are you trying to contact him?

312
00:12:27,435 --> 00:12:29,300
No. He's still alive.

313
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:31,133
- Retired.
- Oh.

314
00:12:31,205 --> 00:12:32,502
At least,
I think he's still alive.

315
00:12:32,573 --> 00:12:34,336
I haven't spoken with him
since last night.

316
00:12:34,408 --> 00:12:35,534
Maybe something happened
this morning.

317
00:12:35,609 --> 00:12:37,042
All right. Look, I get it.

318
00:12:37,111 --> 00:12:38,772
You don't believe in this stuff,
and you probably think...

319
00:12:38,846 --> 00:12:41,007
I'm some loon
who's just wasting your time.

320
00:12:41,082 --> 00:12:43,983
But you know what?
You're here, so why not?

321
00:12:44,051 --> 00:12:46,315
All I'm asking for is five
minutes for you to humor me.

322
00:12:48,889 --> 00:12:50,015
You're right. I'm sorry.

323
00:12:50,091 --> 00:12:51,149
Okay.

324
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,058
Just relax. Give it a go.

325
00:12:58,566 --> 00:13:00,761
Okay. Just think about Kate.

326
00:13:00,835 --> 00:13:04,362
Picture her in your mind:
the way she made you feel...

327
00:13:04,438 --> 00:13:05,803
the way she looked.

328
00:13:05,873 --> 00:13:07,670
Think about Kate.

329
00:13:19,687 --> 00:13:21,712
- Oh, God.
- That didn't sound good.

330
00:13:21,789 --> 00:13:24,849
My assistant. Probably
just shish-kebabbed his tongue.

331
00:13:32,766 --> 00:13:34,131
Oh, God!

332
00:13:35,336 --> 00:13:36,530
Whoa! Oh!

333
00:13:37,238 --> 00:13:38,796
Holy shit!

334
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:46,546
Um, you know,
I-I should get going.

335
00:13:46,614 --> 00:13:47,740
- Really?
- Yeah.

336
00:13:47,815 --> 00:13:49,749
- I wanna check on my dad.
- Oh.

337
00:13:54,088 --> 00:13:55,055
What do I owe you?

338
00:13:55,122 --> 00:13:56,089
Oh, nothing. Nothing.

339
00:13:56,157 --> 00:13:59,388
Oh, no. But I...
I mean...

340
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,518
No, no, no. I-I didn't...

341
00:14:00,594 --> 00:14:01,652
I didn't get anything, so...

342
00:14:01,729 --> 00:14:02,696
Yeah, but you tried.

343
00:14:02,763 --> 00:14:04,492
If someone's pet dies
on the operating table...

344
00:14:04,565 --> 00:14:05,827
you don't charge them, right?
I mean...

345
00:14:07,434 --> 00:14:10,528
No. No, that...
That would make me a dick.

346
00:14:11,605 --> 00:14:13,573
Right.
It's a good thing you don't.

347
00:14:13,641 --> 00:14:16,474
Right. Yes, okay.

348
00:14:16,544 --> 00:14:19,138
If I ever need any catering,
I'll know where to come.

349
00:14:19,213 --> 00:14:20,305
I work cheap, so...

350
00:14:20,381 --> 00:14:22,042
I can see you
why you have two jobs.

351
00:14:22,116 --> 00:14:23,515
- Yeah.
- Nice meeting you, Ashley.

352
00:14:23,584 --> 00:14:25,449
Oh. Nice to meet you.

353
00:14:27,922 --> 00:14:30,857
Say, "Pretty. Pretty bird."

354
00:14:30,925 --> 00:14:32,449
Come on, say it.

355
00:14:32,526 --> 00:14:35,256
You know, I gave you a key
in case of emergencies.

356
00:14:35,329 --> 00:14:36,318
I think you and I just have...

357
00:14:36,397 --> 00:14:38,558
a different definition
of "emergency."

358
00:14:38,632 --> 00:14:41,157
So, how'd it go with Ashley?

359
00:14:41,235 --> 00:14:44,432
Oh, that. Much to my surprise,
it was futile.

360
00:14:44,505 --> 00:14:45,597
You didn't try.

361
00:14:45,673 --> 00:14:46,935
I totally tried.

362
00:14:47,007 --> 00:14:49,737
I chanted, you know, I played
with an eagle feather...

363
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:51,300
listened to some Tori Amos.

364
00:14:52,146 --> 00:14:53,113
And nothing?

365
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,114
I mean, she's really nice,
but, I mean...

366
00:14:55,182 --> 00:14:56,615
the whole thing
was kind of a joke.

367
00:14:56,684 --> 00:14:59,175
Well, does she want you
to come back?

368
00:14:59,253 --> 00:15:00,550
Chloe, enough, all right?

369
00:15:02,323 --> 00:15:03,415
Right. You know what?

370
00:15:04,525 --> 00:15:06,720
I'm never gonna help you again.

371
00:15:06,794 --> 00:15:08,056
Is that a promise?

372
00:15:08,128 --> 00:15:10,756
Well, unless it's an emergency.

373
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,364
Hey, you never told me
how it went on Friday.

374
00:15:15,436 --> 00:15:16,994
Oh, what,
with the stockbroker?

375
00:15:17,071 --> 00:15:19,164
What is it about telling a guy
that you're a psychic...

376
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,537
that makes him think
that you'll sleep with him...

377
00:15:20,608 --> 00:15:22,132
on the first date?

378
00:15:22,209 --> 00:15:24,643
Well, maybe they think that,
because you're a psychic...

379
00:15:24,712 --> 00:15:25,974
you already know
that's all they're after...

380
00:15:26,046 --> 00:15:27,741
so they might
as well just go for it.

381
00:15:27,815 --> 00:15:30,784
That is so your gay prejudice
towards straight men talking.

382
00:15:30,851 --> 00:15:32,978
No, no, it's all men.

383
00:15:33,053 --> 00:15:35,647
Gay, straight, we're a real
goal-oriented gender...

384
00:15:35,723 --> 00:15:36,690
when it comes to sex.

385
00:15:36,757 --> 00:15:39,351
Dan, I think they're a little
more complicated than that.

386
00:15:39,426 --> 00:15:41,291
No, we're not.

387
00:15:41,362 --> 00:15:42,420
How's my ass look in this?

388
00:15:42,496 --> 00:15:44,088
I don't know.
Can you get a little closer?

389
00:15:44,164 --> 00:15:46,132
I still have
some peripheral vision left.

390
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,828
# Hey now now,
we're goin' down down #

391
00:15:48,902 --> 00:15:50,460
# And we ride the bus there #

392
00:15:50,537 --> 00:15:52,061
# Pay the bus fare #

393
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:54,039
# Or we find a new reason #

394
00:15:54,108 --> 00:15:55,268
# A new way of livin' #

395
00:15:55,342 --> 00:15:57,936
# And we shout it out,
and try to... #

396
00:15:58,012 --> 00:15:59,570
Good God, what the hell is that?

397
00:15:59,647 --> 00:16:02,639
Oh, Dr. Mills,
you know this is Beatrice.

398
00:16:02,716 --> 00:16:03,944
Lona, there are other ways
you can show your love...

399
00:16:04,018 --> 00:16:06,043
for Beatrice
besides giving her food.

400
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,145
Take her for a walk,
throw her a Frisbee.

401
00:16:08,222 --> 00:16:10,019
She's gained a little weight,
I know.

402
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:12,081
I've driven cars
smaller than her.

403
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:14,354
She looks like a tick.

404
00:16:14,428 --> 00:16:16,828
The prettiest tick
you've ever seen.

405
00:16:16,897 --> 00:16:18,194
Well, let me grab
a couple of Sherpas.

406
00:16:18,265 --> 00:16:20,290
They can help me hoist her
on the table.

407
00:16:20,367 --> 00:16:23,200
Hey, guys, Beatrice is here.

408
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:25,431
Aw! I call head.

409
00:16:25,506 --> 00:16:27,497
No, I'm not taking the ass
two times in a row.

410
00:16:27,574 --> 00:16:28,939
- Shoot you for it.
- And you...

411
00:16:29,009 --> 00:16:30,476
quit messin' with
whatever you're messing with.

412
00:16:30,544 --> 00:16:32,944
I'm not messing with anything.

413
00:16:33,013 --> 00:16:34,776
I make such a cute doctor.

414
00:16:34,848 --> 00:16:36,281
I should've stayed in college.

415
00:16:37,251 --> 00:16:38,411
These aren't toys.

416
00:16:38,485 --> 00:16:40,112
Oh, hey, just curious...

417
00:16:40,187 --> 00:16:42,951
do animal tranquilizers work
on people?

418
00:16:43,023 --> 00:16:44,354
How'd you get those
out of my cabinet?

419
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,593
Here we go.

420
00:16:48,629 --> 00:16:49,687
Is that it,
or can I go back to, uh...

421
00:16:49,763 --> 00:16:50,889
Go ahead.

422
00:16:50,964 --> 00:16:53,660
Oh, hello,
the reason why I came here.

423
00:16:53,734 --> 00:16:56,635
Um, I've got somebody
I want you to meet.

424
00:16:56,704 --> 00:16:57,671
- Now hoist.
- Oh, God.

425
00:16:57,738 --> 00:16:59,501
Her name is Janet.

426
00:16:59,573 --> 00:17:01,165
- Okay.
- Janet.

427
00:17:01,241 --> 00:17:03,334
I can already tell
I won't like her.

428
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:05,207
She sounds like somebody
with a dream catcher.

429
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,906
So, what,
are you never gonna date again?

430
00:17:07,915 --> 00:17:09,974
I'll date when the right person
comes along.

431
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:11,677
Okay, well,
what if I told you...

432
00:17:11,752 --> 00:17:14,846
she's an eighteen-year-old,
hot masseuse...

433
00:17:14,922 --> 00:17:18,153
with huge natural breasts,
who loves to gourmet cook...

434
00:17:18,225 --> 00:17:20,489
watch sports,
perform oral sex...

435
00:17:20,561 --> 00:17:23,894
and when she's not doing
any of that, she saves whales.

436
00:17:25,299 --> 00:17:27,267
I guess we could have lunch.

437
00:17:27,334 --> 00:17:28,460
Okay.

438
00:17:28,535 --> 00:17:30,400
What if she doesn't do
any of those things?

439
00:17:30,471 --> 00:17:31,665
Goodbye, Chloe.

440
00:17:31,739 --> 00:17:33,764
Tell me when you wanna start
dating again, okay?

441
00:17:33,841 --> 00:17:35,706
Two years, five years, what?

442
00:17:35,776 --> 00:17:37,038
I had the person I was gonna
spend my life with...

443
00:17:37,111 --> 00:17:38,078
and I lost her.

444
00:17:38,145 --> 00:17:41,512
So you're just gonna spend
the rest of your life alone?

445
00:17:41,582 --> 00:17:43,072
No, I've got you.
I've got my work.

446
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:44,276
I'm sure
you're gonna get married...

447
00:17:44,351 --> 00:17:47,286
and have kids or adopt
a slew of Nigerian children...

448
00:17:47,354 --> 00:17:48,753
and I'm gonna get
to be Uncle Henry.

449
00:17:48,822 --> 00:17:49,948
Um...

450
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:52,717
- Man down!
- There's a man down.

451
00:17:52,793 --> 00:17:54,192
All right, I've got to get...

452
00:17:56,864 --> 00:17:57,922
Why would you even want these?

453
00:17:57,998 --> 00:18:00,023
They're just cool.

454
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,829
They're so big.

455
00:18:03,737 --> 00:18:05,170
I can't move my legs.

456
00:18:05,239 --> 00:18:06,365
Oh!

457
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,645
I'm so sorry to bother you.

458
00:18:14,715 --> 00:18:17,582
I was wondering if you would
maybe try again with Henry.

459
00:18:17,651 --> 00:18:18,982
I mean, he really liked you...

460
00:18:19,052 --> 00:18:20,644
and if
he's ever gonna believe...

461
00:18:20,721 --> 00:18:23,315
that anyone is talking to Kate,
then I think it's gonna be you.

462
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:25,051
Yeah, I mean,
I think that's a great idea.

463
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:27,821
I just... I don't know
if he'll go for it.

464
00:18:27,895 --> 00:18:29,726
I don't think
he would come to you...

465
00:18:29,797 --> 00:18:31,958
but if you would go to him...

466
00:18:32,032 --> 00:18:34,227
and you could prove
that you heard from Kate...

467
00:18:35,469 --> 00:18:36,595
But I didn't.

468
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:38,297
- You could fake it.
- Oh, no, no, no.

469
00:18:38,372 --> 00:18:39,566
I can't do that...

470
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,302
'cause I'm not like a,
you know, scam artist.

471
00:18:42,376 --> 00:18:43,968
This is Kate's diary.
I, um...

472
00:18:44,044 --> 00:18:45,636
I went into Henry's apartment
when he wasn't there...

473
00:18:45,712 --> 00:18:47,145
you know, looking for letters
or anything...

474
00:18:47,214 --> 00:18:48,272
that would have information...

475
00:18:48,348 --> 00:18:50,111
that only the two of them
would know, and, I mean...

476
00:18:50,184 --> 00:18:51,617
Henry doesn't even know
this exists.

477
00:18:51,685 --> 00:18:52,947
Right. I just... I really...

478
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,647
Look, I know that you've heard
the story before...

479
00:18:54,721 --> 00:18:56,450
but would you really think
about it?

480
00:18:56,523 --> 00:18:58,923
Do you really think that Henry's
better off sitting alone...

481
00:18:58,992 --> 00:19:00,789
in his apartment
for the rest of his life?

482
00:19:00,861 --> 00:19:02,055
Do you really think
that Kate's ghost...

483
00:19:02,129 --> 00:19:03,528
doesn't want him to date again?

484
00:19:03,597 --> 00:19:07,226
I'm just asking you to tell
one little lie...

485
00:19:07,301 --> 00:19:08,768
to salvage someone's life.

486
00:19:08,836 --> 00:19:10,633
Is that so impossible?

487
00:19:17,778 --> 00:19:20,508
Hey. Ashley, right?

488
00:19:20,581 --> 00:19:22,014
- Yeah.
- Henry.

489
00:19:22,082 --> 00:19:23,549
Henry. Hi.

490
00:19:23,617 --> 00:19:24,948
- How are you?
- Yeah, good, good.

491
00:19:25,018 --> 00:19:26,110
You shop here?

492
00:19:26,186 --> 00:19:27,949
Yeah, they, uh... They have
really great tomatoes here...

493
00:19:28,021 --> 00:19:32,458
so I just...
Oh, I see. Okay.

494
00:19:32,526 --> 00:19:35,984
Uh, tomatoes are vegetables
that you buy fresh...

495
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,758
and then you cook them in food.

496
00:19:37,831 --> 00:19:39,298
I've heard about these, yeah.

497
00:19:39,366 --> 00:19:41,061
I always wondered what was
on this side of the store.

498
00:19:41,134 --> 00:19:42,999
- So colorful.
- Yeah.

499
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,503
How's business?

500
00:19:44,571 --> 00:19:45,833
Oh, you know, sucks.

501
00:19:45,906 --> 00:19:48,431
- So it's looking up.
- Look up, right.

502
00:19:49,476 --> 00:19:50,670
Well, you know,
I'll let you go...

503
00:19:50,744 --> 00:19:52,211
but, uh, if you're
ever in the area...

504
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:53,803
you should stop by,
and I'll cook you a...

505
00:19:53,881 --> 00:19:55,314
I'll cook you a real meal.

506
00:19:55,382 --> 00:19:56,644
All right.
Well, maybe I'll do that.

507
00:19:56,717 --> 00:19:57,706
- Okay.
- Nice seeing you.

508
00:19:57,784 --> 00:19:58,842
Nice seeing you.

509
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:05,052
It was raining.

510
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:06,092
It was raining
when you met her...

511
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:07,285
the woman you were trying
to contact.

512
00:20:07,361 --> 00:20:10,728
It was nighttime,
and it was raining.

513
00:20:10,797 --> 00:20:12,230
You tried to steal her cab?

514
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:14,133
Yeah.

515
00:20:14,201 --> 00:20:16,396
And you two...
You two got into a fight...

516
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:18,131
but you rode with her
all the way home...

517
00:20:18,205 --> 00:20:20,435
even though you lived
in totally opposite directions.

518
00:20:20,507 --> 00:20:22,441
That's exactly what happened.

519
00:20:22,509 --> 00:20:23,669
And she stiffed me.

520
00:20:23,744 --> 00:20:25,905
I wound up paying eighty bucks
for that cab ride.

521
00:20:27,314 --> 00:20:29,111
Do you wanna go somewhere else,
so we can talk?

522
00:20:31,151 --> 00:20:32,175
Yeah, it's...

523
00:20:33,754 --> 00:20:34,778
Yeah.

524
00:20:37,324 --> 00:20:39,224
So I noticed you didn't have
any animals in your apartment.

525
00:20:39,293 --> 00:20:41,523
Oh, well, my building
doesn't allow pets...

526
00:20:41,595 --> 00:20:43,153
but I always grew up with cats.

527
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:44,424
Oh.

528
00:20:45,632 --> 00:20:46,792
When I get a new a place,
I think I might...

529
00:20:46,867 --> 00:20:48,266
Wait. Why'd you go, "Oh"?

530
00:20:48,335 --> 00:20:50,394
"Oh, you had cats.
That's nice."

531
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:53,496
No, that was more like,
"Ah, you had cats. Figures."

532
00:20:53,574 --> 00:20:54,768
I'm a vet. I love cats.

533
00:20:54,841 --> 00:20:56,775
Right.
And the women who have them?

534
00:20:57,711 --> 00:20:59,702
They're insane,
across the board.

535
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,042
You know, they wear,
like, sweatshirts...

536
00:21:01,114 --> 00:21:02,342
- with their cat on them.
- Oh.

537
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:04,407
You know, "Hang in there."

538
00:21:04,484 --> 00:21:06,884
Hey, look,
let me ask you, when...

539
00:21:06,954 --> 00:21:10,822
In the market,
were you, like...

540
00:21:10,891 --> 00:21:12,415
Were you hearing someone?

541
00:21:12,492 --> 00:21:14,460
Um, yeah, I mean, I think...
I think so.

542
00:21:14,528 --> 00:21:16,553
I think it was Kate.

543
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:18,757
Seems a little hard to believe.

544
00:21:18,832 --> 00:21:21,198
I know,
but do you wanna try again?

545
00:21:23,804 --> 00:21:25,237
What do you got to lose?

546
00:21:27,474 --> 00:21:28,441
All right.

547
00:21:28,508 --> 00:21:30,908
Let me just get
your hand, like... Okay.

548
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,170
This restaurant
reminds her of something.

549
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:38,375
New York. It was snowing.

550
00:21:39,853 --> 00:21:42,481
We went...
We went there for Christmas.

551
00:21:42,556 --> 00:21:44,524
You refused to admit
that you didn't speak French...

552
00:21:45,492 --> 00:21:47,289
so you ordered the pancreas?

553
00:21:48,729 --> 00:21:51,721
And then, later,
after you threw up all...

554
00:21:55,636 --> 00:21:57,365
Hello. No, yeah.

555
00:21:57,437 --> 00:21:58,699
No, no, no,
I'm just eating right now.

556
00:21:58,772 --> 00:21:59,932
You're not interrupting
anything.

557
00:22:00,007 --> 00:22:02,032
Are you serious?

558
00:22:02,109 --> 00:22:03,076
Just so you know,
that wasn't me.

559
00:22:03,143 --> 00:22:04,610
- That was J.W. I swear.
- Wow.

560
00:22:04,678 --> 00:22:05,736
What else?
Are you getting anything else?

561
00:22:05,812 --> 00:22:07,746
- Okay, listen, we'll come over tonight...
- Yeah, I'm just, I gotta...

562
00:22:07,814 --> 00:22:09,008
I gotta get back into it.

563
00:22:09,082 --> 00:22:10,106
- Okay?
- and we can meet afterwards.

564
00:22:10,183 --> 00:22:11,172
Great.

565
00:22:11,251 --> 00:22:13,776
Look, bro, when I see four girls
in matching bowling shirts...

566
00:22:13,854 --> 00:22:15,151
that's how I roll, man.

567
00:22:15,222 --> 00:22:16,849
It's totally true.

568
00:22:16,923 --> 00:22:18,083
Sorry, I'm,
like, totally thrown...

569
00:22:18,158 --> 00:22:19,125
No, it was great.

570
00:22:19,192 --> 00:22:21,183
- with the cell phone guy, um...
- I don't know where to begin.

571
00:22:21,261 --> 00:22:23,320
- We should just try another time.
- We started out with a donkey.

572
00:22:23,397 --> 00:22:24,989
Yeah,
I have to get going anyway.

573
00:22:25,065 --> 00:22:26,032
What are the odds there was...

574
00:22:26,099 --> 00:22:27,896
- two chicks named Darla?
- Oh. When'd you give her your card?

575
00:22:27,968 --> 00:22:30,459
That's all right. You got
your tricks, I've got mine.

576
00:22:30,537 --> 00:22:32,027
- Wow.
- Seriously?

577
00:22:32,105 --> 00:22:33,538
Yeah, but you don't really have
to be tricky...

578
00:22:33,607 --> 00:22:35,905
if you wanna pay for lunch,
because I won't fight ya.

579
00:22:35,976 --> 00:22:37,534
Yup. Cat person.

580
00:22:37,611 --> 00:22:39,272
I thought it was the one
without her.

581
00:22:39,346 --> 00:22:40,370
Thank you.

582
00:22:40,447 --> 00:22:42,210
I was actually really nervous
at first...

583
00:22:42,282 --> 00:22:43,442
but then it was so easy.

584
00:22:43,517 --> 00:22:44,541
I almost wanted it
to be harder...

585
00:22:44,618 --> 00:22:46,483
so I wouldn't feel bad
about the situation.

586
00:22:47,954 --> 00:22:49,046
- What?
- Ashley.

587
00:22:51,058 --> 00:22:52,855
- No.
- Look in my eyes.

588
00:22:52,926 --> 00:22:54,416
- No.
- It's time for a reality check.

589
00:22:54,494 --> 00:22:55,586
I don't want a reality check.

590
00:22:55,662 --> 00:22:56,959
You don't want one,
because you know you need one.

591
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:59,157
Tell me you are done with this.

592
00:22:59,232 --> 00:23:00,256
I'm done...

593
00:23:01,568 --> 00:23:02,535
right after this next meeting.

594
00:23:02,602 --> 00:23:03,899
Why are you doing all this?

595
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:05,267
I'm... I'm helping someone.

596
00:23:06,773 --> 00:23:08,035
Is he cute?

597
00:23:08,108 --> 00:23:09,473
I don't see what that has to do
with anything.

598
00:23:09,543 --> 00:23:10,510
Stay with me here.

599
00:23:10,577 --> 00:23:12,067
You, ahem...
You hate doing this.

600
00:23:12,145 --> 00:23:13,976
Yeah, it goes against
everything I believe.

601
00:23:14,047 --> 00:23:15,480
All right,
but instead of just doing it

602
00:23:15,549 --> 00:23:17,881
and getting it over with,
you're stretching it out.

603
00:23:17,951 --> 00:23:19,213
Well, he's very skeptical.

604
00:23:19,286 --> 00:23:21,413
I can't just blurt it out,
or else he'd never believe me.

605
00:23:21,488 --> 00:23:23,956
Today, you had lunch.
Tomorrow, who knows, dinner?

606
00:23:24,024 --> 00:23:25,218
Maybe you'll go to a movie...

607
00:23:25,292 --> 00:23:26,452
channel his fiancée there.

608
00:23:26,526 --> 00:23:27,720
- So off base.
- What does he do?

609
00:23:27,794 --> 00:23:29,625
- Veterinarian.
- A doctor.

610
00:23:29,696 --> 00:23:30,822
If you weren't gay,
I'd think you're jealous.

611
00:23:30,897 --> 00:23:31,864
If you weren't blushing...

612
00:23:31,932 --> 00:23:33,092
I'd think you were telling
the truth.

613
00:23:35,202 --> 00:23:37,227
So you like
David Foster Wallace, huh?

614
00:23:37,304 --> 00:23:38,635
I couldn't get past page 20.

615
00:23:38,705 --> 00:23:40,639
I keep it there
because it makes me look smart.

616
00:23:41,575 --> 00:23:43,065
Oh. Huh.

617
00:23:44,344 --> 00:23:46,244
Oh, God, is he, like, a friend
of yours or something?

618
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:51,881
You got me a gift?

619
00:23:51,952 --> 00:23:54,011
Well, you won't charge me,
and I'm taking up your time...

620
00:23:54,087 --> 00:23:55,816
so, you know,
I had to do something.

621
00:23:58,759 --> 00:23:59,987
David Foster Wallace!

622
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,687
I love him.

623
00:24:01,762 --> 00:24:03,923
I saw the book last time,
so I figured you were a fan.

624
00:24:03,997 --> 00:24:05,555
I am. I am.

625
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:07,156
I can't wait to not read this.

626
00:24:07,234 --> 00:24:08,201
Yeah, they're short stories...

627
00:24:08,268 --> 00:24:09,792
so you could read
the first paragraph...

628
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:11,064
of each one and then just quit.

629
00:24:11,138 --> 00:24:12,162
That's... That's great.

630
00:24:12,239 --> 00:24:14,207
No, this is, um...
This was really sweet of you.

631
00:24:14,274 --> 00:24:15,298
Thank you.

632
00:24:16,409 --> 00:24:17,467
Should we get started?

633
00:24:17,544 --> 00:24:18,670
- Yeah.
- Okay.

634
00:24:19,546 --> 00:24:23,038
Oh, before we start, I've been
doing a little research.

635
00:24:24,184 --> 00:24:25,344
Okay.

636
00:24:25,418 --> 00:24:27,978
Some of the things you've said
are pretty unbelievable...

637
00:24:28,054 --> 00:24:30,113
and I think I know
how you're doing it.

638
00:24:31,091 --> 00:24:32,058
Really?

639
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:33,558
Normally, in these readings...

640
00:24:33,627 --> 00:24:36,460
the person that's getting read
gives out unconscious signals.

641
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:38,191
Like you could
suggest something...

642
00:24:38,265 --> 00:24:40,825
and then I'll
shake my head no or nod...

643
00:24:40,901 --> 00:24:42,869
and I don't even realize it,
but you pick up on it...

644
00:24:42,936 --> 00:24:44,233
and then you get closer
and closer...

645
00:24:44,304 --> 00:24:45,601
until you actually get
something.

646
00:24:46,406 --> 00:24:48,601
All right,
well, that makes sense.

647
00:24:48,675 --> 00:24:50,302
How do you...
How do you wanna deal with that?

648
00:24:50,377 --> 00:24:51,776
Well, I'm gonna concentrate
really hard...

649
00:24:51,845 --> 00:24:53,142
on not giving you anything.

650
00:24:53,213 --> 00:24:54,908
I mean,
keep my body very still...

651
00:24:54,981 --> 00:24:57,108
not change my voice. Nothin'.

652
00:24:57,184 --> 00:24:58,913
Okay. Sounds good.

653
00:24:58,985 --> 00:25:00,213
Uh, let's start.

654
00:25:00,287 --> 00:25:01,379
Okay.

655
00:25:02,989 --> 00:25:04,616
You're gonna talk like that
the whole time?

656
00:25:04,691 --> 00:25:06,022
Yes.

657
00:25:06,092 --> 00:25:07,116
You know what?

658
00:25:07,194 --> 00:25:09,560
I'm still picking up a slight
bit of emotion from you...

659
00:25:09,629 --> 00:25:10,857
so what I think
we should do...

660
00:25:10,931 --> 00:25:14,628
is turn our chairs back to back
so I can't see you at all.

661
00:25:14,701 --> 00:25:15,725
- Okay.
- Okay?

662
00:25:21,474 --> 00:25:23,066
- Better?
- Yes.

663
00:25:24,144 --> 00:25:25,111
You know what?

664
00:25:25,178 --> 00:25:27,305
To be safe, I think we should be
in separate rooms.

665
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,371
Oh, but then
I'm gonna have to shout.

666
00:25:29,449 --> 00:25:31,417
Yeah, all right. Now you're
just messing with me, right?

667
00:25:33,486 --> 00:25:34,976
Yes.

668
00:25:35,055 --> 00:25:37,023
That's pretty stupid, huh?

669
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:38,114
Yes.

670
00:25:38,191 --> 00:25:39,283
You wanna
go get something to eat?

671
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:40,383
Yes.

672
00:25:44,464 --> 00:25:46,455
So, you bring
all your psychics here?

673
00:25:46,533 --> 00:25:48,160
Well, you really should know
the answer to that.

674
00:25:49,803 --> 00:25:51,498
But this is a cool place
that you picked...

675
00:25:51,571 --> 00:25:52,538
I'll give you that.

676
00:25:52,606 --> 00:25:54,130
Kate showed it to me.

677
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:00,706
You know,
I'm getting the feeling...

678
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:02,941
like she wants you
to be happy again...

679
00:26:03,016 --> 00:26:04,711
like when you used to come here.

680
00:26:06,019 --> 00:26:07,577
I'm getting that feeling, too.

681
00:26:18,198 --> 00:26:19,927
You are so screwed.

682
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,968
- What?
- I didn't say anything.

683
00:26:22,869 --> 00:26:25,099
Oh. Right.

684
00:26:29,209 --> 00:26:30,233
Traitors.

685
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:33,871
Lying, cheating,
red-headed hussy.

686
00:26:33,947 --> 00:26:35,141
I'll wring her neck.

687
00:26:36,449 --> 00:26:39,907
Throw her in front of a car,
throw her down some stairs.

688
00:26:39,986 --> 00:26:42,978
# She had blonde hair,
blue eyes, too #

689
00:26:43,056 --> 00:26:45,024
# And she had
a little itty-bitty #

690
00:26:45,091 --> 00:26:46,615
# Hootchie-cootchie-coo #

691
00:26:46,693 --> 00:26:48,524
You. You bastard.

692
00:26:48,595 --> 00:26:50,563
Whoa. Hey, evening, Miss.

693
00:26:51,464 --> 00:26:52,431
You can hear me?

694
00:26:52,499 --> 00:26:53,659
Unfortunately.

695
00:26:53,733 --> 00:26:54,700
Are you psychic?

696
00:26:54,768 --> 00:26:56,030
No, dead.

697
00:26:56,636 --> 00:26:58,069
Good. What happened?

698
00:26:58,138 --> 00:27:00,038
Drunk driving accident.

699
00:27:00,106 --> 00:27:01,903
Oh, so backing over me
with your truck wasn't enough...

700
00:27:01,975 --> 00:27:03,670
to get you to stop
drinking and driving?

701
00:27:03,743 --> 00:27:04,971
I'm not proud.

702
00:27:05,045 --> 00:27:06,103
What are you doing here?

703
00:27:06,179 --> 00:27:07,305
Same as you.

704
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:10,645
Takin' care
of unfinished business.

705
00:27:10,717 --> 00:27:11,911
Are you sure
that's why you're here?

706
00:27:11,985 --> 00:27:13,247
That's what the lady told me.

707
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,912
- The lady in the white room?
- 'Course.

708
00:27:14,988 --> 00:27:16,387
Why, what'd she tell you?

709
00:27:16,456 --> 00:27:17,480
None of your business.

710
00:27:18,325 --> 00:27:19,792
Did she give you any hints?

711
00:27:19,859 --> 00:27:21,622
How... How specific was she?

712
00:27:22,829 --> 00:27:24,922
Ah, you didn't talk to her,
did you?

713
00:27:25,865 --> 00:27:27,264
What'd you do, piss her off?

714
00:27:27,334 --> 00:27:28,631
Unfinished business.

715
00:27:31,438 --> 00:27:32,462
Well, that's it.

716
00:27:33,974 --> 00:27:35,498
I got to protect Henry.

717
00:27:35,575 --> 00:27:36,599
Yeah.

718
00:27:36,676 --> 00:27:38,371
Wh... Hey, hey!

719
00:27:39,646 --> 00:27:40,670
You're welcome.

720
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:46,150
Hey. Can I help you?

721
00:27:46,219 --> 00:27:47,516
Hi. Um, I'm sorry.

722
00:27:47,587 --> 00:27:48,781
I called, and no one answered.

723
00:27:48,855 --> 00:27:51,688
Um, my friend gave me
your number in yoga class.

724
00:27:51,758 --> 00:27:53,350
Well, I'm just having
a really bad day.

725
00:27:53,426 --> 00:27:56,884
My... My friend died,
and we had a fight.

726
00:27:56,963 --> 00:27:59,625
Oh, okay, okay.
Sure, sure, sure, come in.

727
00:27:59,699 --> 00:28:00,927
Come in. It's fine.

728
00:28:01,001 --> 00:28:02,263
Thank you.

729
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:06,097
Okay. Come right this way.

730
00:28:08,375 --> 00:28:10,002
I'm sorry,
I didn't catch your name.

731
00:28:10,076 --> 00:28:12,544
Oh, it's Kay... eleen.

732
00:28:12,612 --> 00:28:14,102
- Kayleen?
- Mm-hmm.

733
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,772
Great.
Um, why don't you come this way.

734
00:28:15,849 --> 00:28:16,975
Uh, just have a seat.

735
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:19,041
Do you want a drink or anything?

736
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:20,086
No, I'm fine.

737
00:28:20,153 --> 00:28:21,120
Okay, great.

738
00:28:21,187 --> 00:28:22,984
Make yourself comfortable.

739
00:28:24,257 --> 00:28:25,622
Okay.

740
00:28:27,694 --> 00:28:29,127
So, you talk to dead people?

741
00:28:29,195 --> 00:28:31,288
Well, I can't promise results...

742
00:28:31,364 --> 00:28:33,355
but, yes,
I have had some success.

743
00:28:33,433 --> 00:28:35,424
Comes in nice and clear, huh?

744
00:28:35,502 --> 00:28:36,469
No mistaking it?

745
00:28:36,536 --> 00:28:37,696
Sometimes, yeah.

746
00:28:37,771 --> 00:28:38,829
Great. Can't wait.

747
00:28:38,905 --> 00:28:40,167
All right, so the first thing
I'm gonna have you do...

748
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,434
is give me your hands.

749
00:28:41,508 --> 00:28:43,533
Uh, you...
Uh, we probably shouldn't...

750
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:45,874
because I'm, uh,
coming down with a cold.

751
00:28:52,652 --> 00:28:55,553
Okay. Um, great.

752
00:28:55,622 --> 00:28:56,919
Okay, this is what
we'll do then.

753
00:28:56,990 --> 00:29:00,619
Um, why don't you concentrate
on your friend, okay?

754
00:29:00,693 --> 00:29:02,786
And let's try to see
if she can come through to us.

755
00:29:02,862 --> 00:29:04,557
- You're the psychic.
- Great.

756
00:29:11,171 --> 00:29:13,332
Yeah, wow,
I'm getting something.

757
00:29:13,406 --> 00:29:17,365
Ashley Clark, you have made
a mockery of the gifts...

758
00:29:17,444 --> 00:29:18,934
you've been given.

759
00:29:19,012 --> 00:29:20,980
Uh, Kayleen?

760
00:29:21,047 --> 00:29:23,515
You speak falsely for the dead.

761
00:29:23,583 --> 00:29:26,552
We have been sent here
to give you a warning.

762
00:29:26,619 --> 00:29:30,646
Stop now or suffer
a terrible fate.

763
00:29:30,723 --> 00:29:32,156
Is this some sort of joke?

764
00:29:32,225 --> 00:29:33,556
This is no joke.

765
00:29:33,626 --> 00:29:36,561
We see and hear everything.

766
00:29:36,629 --> 00:29:40,190
We saw you drop the tray
of meatballs last night...

767
00:29:40,266 --> 00:29:42,530
and still serve them.

768
00:29:42,602 --> 00:29:45,628
We saw what you did
in the shower last night...

769
00:29:46,539 --> 00:29:48,404
and it's nothing
to be ashamed of...

770
00:29:48,475 --> 00:29:50,773
but we still saw.

771
00:29:50,844 --> 00:29:52,744
And we see
what you're trying to do...

772
00:29:52,812 --> 00:29:54,302
to Henry Mills.

773
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:56,314
I... I'm just...

774
00:29:56,382 --> 00:29:57,508
You, of all people...

775
00:29:57,584 --> 00:30:00,451
should know the consequences
of defaming the dead.

776
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,454
Leave Henry Mills alone...

777
00:30:02,522 --> 00:30:05,252
or you will never
find peace again.

778
00:30:05,325 --> 00:30:08,590
You will lose your possessions,
your friends...

779
00:30:08,661 --> 00:30:12,028
and eventually your life.

780
00:30:12,098 --> 00:30:16,125
This is the only time
we will visit you.

781
00:30:21,808 --> 00:30:24,208
Oh, I must've dozed off.

782
00:30:24,277 --> 00:30:25,801
Did you contact my friend?

783
00:30:26,946 --> 00:30:28,277
Ashley, are you okay?

784
00:30:30,884 --> 00:30:31,873
Please go.

785
00:30:31,951 --> 00:30:33,976
Well, you look
like you've seen a ghost.

786
00:30:34,053 --> 00:30:36,248
Can you go now, please?

787
00:30:36,322 --> 00:30:37,346
Just go.

788
00:30:57,443 --> 00:30:58,842
You'll never guess
who I ran into.

789
00:30:58,912 --> 00:31:00,174
- Who?
- Ashley.

790
00:31:01,481 --> 00:31:02,880
Ashley...

791
00:31:02,949 --> 00:31:04,541
I know so many Ashleys.

792
00:31:04,617 --> 00:31:05,584
The psychic.

793
00:31:05,652 --> 00:31:07,745
Oh, that Ashley.

794
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:09,811
- What did she say?
- Well, it was really weird.

795
00:31:09,889 --> 00:31:13,552
I mean, she got these images,
really specific stuff.

796
00:31:13,626 --> 00:31:15,355
Really? Wow.

797
00:31:15,428 --> 00:31:16,554
Will she get a message
from Kate?

798
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:19,391
- Like what?
- Huh?

799
00:31:19,465 --> 00:31:20,830
- What?
- What?

800
00:31:21,801 --> 00:31:24,929
Anyway, we're, you know,
gonna try it again.

801
00:31:25,004 --> 00:31:26,767
That's great.
That's... I really...

802
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:28,431
I feel like
she can help you, Henry.

803
00:31:28,975 --> 00:31:30,533
Come on, Ashley!

804
00:31:32,078 --> 00:31:33,443
Ashley, come on!

805
00:31:33,513 --> 00:31:35,037
She's not home?

806
00:31:36,182 --> 00:31:38,275
Uh, why?

807
00:31:38,351 --> 00:31:39,375
Are you here to meet her?

808
00:31:39,452 --> 00:31:41,317
No, we had, um, an appointment.

809
00:31:41,387 --> 00:31:43,116
Wait a second.
Are you Henry...

810
00:31:43,189 --> 00:31:44,850
the-the veterinarian?

811
00:31:44,924 --> 00:31:46,118
She mentioned me?

812
00:31:46,192 --> 00:31:47,454
No, it's just
a really lucky guess.

813
00:31:47,527 --> 00:31:48,926
I'm good like that.

814
00:31:48,995 --> 00:31:50,428
I'm Dan, the catering partner.

815
00:31:50,496 --> 00:31:51,895
- Right. Hi, Dan.
- Hi.

816
00:31:51,965 --> 00:31:53,592
Yeah, we were supposed to meet
an hour and a half ago...

817
00:31:53,666 --> 00:31:55,930
at this restaurant, but
she's not answering her phone.

818
00:31:56,002 --> 00:31:57,731
I know.
I've been calling her all day.

819
00:31:57,804 --> 00:31:58,828
Do you mind if I try?

820
00:31:59,706 --> 00:32:01,333
Knocking?

821
00:32:01,407 --> 00:32:04,205
Please. No, please.
Help yourself.

822
00:32:04,277 --> 00:32:06,177
Maybe later you can come
jab an elevator button...

823
00:32:06,246 --> 00:32:07,907
a hundred times
after I've already pushed it.

824
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:11,517
Ashley!

825
00:32:11,584 --> 00:32:13,745
Ashley, it's Henry.
Are you there?

826
00:32:14,787 --> 00:32:16,516
Henry, I'm sick!

827
00:32:16,589 --> 00:32:19,149
I tried to call.

828
00:32:19,225 --> 00:32:21,523
I might be sick
for a really long time.

829
00:32:22,962 --> 00:32:24,327
Okay, do you need anything?

830
00:32:24,397 --> 00:32:27,958
No. I'll call you
if I ever feel better.

831
00:32:28,034 --> 00:32:29,365
Ashley?

832
00:32:30,003 --> 00:32:31,129
Ashley!

833
00:32:35,108 --> 00:32:36,336
Got more than you did.

834
00:32:40,613 --> 00:32:43,013
Hey, it's Ashley,
psychic-slash-caterer...

835
00:32:43,082 --> 00:32:44,413
leave an awesome message.

836
00:32:44,484 --> 00:32:46,042
Good morning. It's Henry.

837
00:32:46,119 --> 00:32:47,677
Just thought I'd check in
since you didn't...

838
00:32:47,754 --> 00:32:48,706
# This little light of mine #

839
00:32:48,707 --> 00:32:50,314
sound so good last night,
see if you're all right.

840
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:53,587
- So, um, you all right?
- # I'm gonna let it shine #

841
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:54,957
Morning again.

842
00:32:55,028 --> 00:32:56,859
It's, uh, Henry again.

843
00:32:56,929 --> 00:32:58,829
That's some cold.
I hope you didn't get it...

844
00:32:58,898 --> 00:33:00,092
when we went out
the other night.

845
00:33:00,166 --> 00:33:01,360
Anyway, I was gonna...

846
00:33:01,434 --> 00:33:03,595
you know, come by and drop off
some soup or something...

847
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:05,934
so, um, maybe I'll see you.

848
00:33:07,407 --> 00:33:09,773
# Shine, let it shine #

849
00:33:09,842 --> 00:33:13,073
# Even if it burns your eyes #

850
00:33:13,146 --> 00:33:15,842
# This light of mine is mine #

851
00:33:15,915 --> 00:33:17,678
- # And I'm gonna let it shine #
- It's Henry.

852
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:20,548
The sandwich was gone, so,
you know, that's a good sign.

853
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:21,917
Buying a sandwich for someone...

854
00:33:21,988 --> 00:33:23,148
you've never
had a sandwich with...

855
00:33:23,222 --> 00:33:24,484
is a lot harder than you think.

856
00:33:24,557 --> 00:33:25,956
I mean, just the bread.

857
00:33:26,025 --> 00:33:27,492
I started off
with whole wheat...

858
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,528
but then I worried that,
you know, I'm saying...

859
00:33:29,595 --> 00:33:31,028
you're kind
of a crunchy person...

860
00:33:31,097 --> 00:33:32,758
who only eats whole wheat.

861
00:33:32,832 --> 00:33:35,323
I almost went with pumpernickel,
but then I'd look like...

862
00:33:35,401 --> 00:33:36,891
the kind of guy
who wants to impose...

863
00:33:36,969 --> 00:33:39,301
my weird bread fetish
on everyone and...

864
00:33:39,372 --> 00:33:42,034
You know, now, I'm one of those
idiots who just prattles on...

865
00:33:42,108 --> 00:33:43,598
in, uh, answering machines...

866
00:33:45,078 --> 00:33:46,875
and also uses a word
like "prattles."

867
00:33:48,081 --> 00:33:50,447
So the only thing I can think of
is that, uh, you really just...

868
00:33:50,516 --> 00:33:51,778
you don't
wanna talk to me anymore.

869
00:33:52,885 --> 00:33:56,480
Um, if that's right,
well, um...

870
00:33:56,556 --> 00:33:57,921
I don't know, I guess just...

871
00:33:57,990 --> 00:33:59,651
kinda keep doin'
what you're doin'.

872
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:03,660
- # Shine, let it shine #
- So, take care of yourself...

873
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:06,824
- # Even if it burns your eyes #
- Ashley.

874
00:34:06,899 --> 00:34:09,459
# This light of mine is mine #

875
00:34:09,535 --> 00:34:11,901
# And I'm gonna let it shine #

876
00:34:12,872 --> 00:34:14,396
There you are.

877
00:34:14,474 --> 00:34:15,600
Why have you been avoiding
my brother?

878
00:34:15,675 --> 00:34:17,336
Uh, I can explain.

879
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:18,468
Um...

880
00:34:22,749 --> 00:34:24,080
I guess I can't explain.

881
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:25,139
Okay,
if you didn't wanna do this...

882
00:34:25,218 --> 00:34:26,185
you should've just said so...

883
00:34:26,252 --> 00:34:27,378
but to lead him on
and let him think...

884
00:34:27,453 --> 00:34:29,080
that you can help him
and then just disappear?

885
00:34:29,822 --> 00:34:31,585
I mean, he's worse off,
if that's possible.

886
00:34:31,657 --> 00:34:32,715
I just couldn't do it anymore,
all right?

887
00:34:32,792 --> 00:34:33,759
I'm sorry.

888
00:34:33,826 --> 00:34:35,157
Please tell him I'm sorry.

889
00:34:35,228 --> 00:34:36,388
Did you run out of things
to say?

890
00:34:36,462 --> 00:34:37,429
- No, it's not that. It's not that.
- Because I have...

891
00:34:37,497 --> 00:34:38,464
- It's not...
- more information.

892
00:34:38,531 --> 00:34:39,964
I have letters
and some pictures and...

893
00:34:40,032 --> 00:34:41,624
- Is that her?
- Yeah, that's Kate.

894
00:34:47,073 --> 00:34:48,563
Oh, God!

895
00:34:48,641 --> 00:34:49,608
Wait, what do...
What does that mean?

896
00:34:49,675 --> 00:34:51,438
Do... Do you want the letters?

897
00:34:51,511 --> 00:34:54,309
All right, show's over.

898
00:34:55,415 --> 00:34:57,315
Come out. I know who you are...

899
00:34:57,383 --> 00:34:58,350
Kate.

900
00:34:58,418 --> 00:34:59,680
- Boo.
- God.

901
00:35:00,586 --> 00:35:03,521
God, it's really you.
This is unbelievable.

902
00:35:03,589 --> 00:35:05,113
- Are you really like a...
- Ghost?

903
00:35:06,092 --> 00:35:07,320
It's the only way
I can explain it.

904
00:35:07,393 --> 00:35:08,621
That is awesome.

905
00:35:09,562 --> 00:35:10,961
Here, catch.

906
00:35:15,201 --> 00:35:16,168
Nice throw.

907
00:35:16,235 --> 00:35:17,327
Crap.

908
00:35:18,438 --> 00:35:20,235
Hey, what was that
the other day, man?

909
00:35:20,306 --> 00:35:22,467
I was just trying to help out
the situation.

910
00:35:22,542 --> 00:35:23,509
Help?

911
00:35:23,576 --> 00:35:25,203
You were helping yourself
to Henry.

912
00:35:26,479 --> 00:35:27,503
Okay, so, like, I'm like...

913
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,775
I'm like
slightly attracted to him.

914
00:35:29,849 --> 00:35:30,941
Well, he's not right for you.

915
00:35:31,017 --> 00:35:32,177
Yes, he is.

916
00:35:32,251 --> 00:35:35,982
He is considerate, and
he is sweet, and, you know...

917
00:35:36,055 --> 00:35:37,955
pulls the chair out for me
when I sit.

918
00:35:38,024 --> 00:35:38,991
Big deal.

919
00:35:39,058 --> 00:35:40,753
It is a big deal,
and you know it, okay?

920
00:35:40,827 --> 00:35:42,522
He's been wonderful to me
from the second he met me...

921
00:35:42,595 --> 00:35:44,290
even though he probably thought
I was a little crazy.

922
00:35:44,363 --> 00:35:45,330
Well, you do
talk to dead people.

923
00:35:45,398 --> 00:35:46,365
That's a little crazy.

924
00:35:46,432 --> 00:35:47,626
Oh, I'm crazy?

925
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:50,464
You're the one who's spying
on me in the frickin' shower.

926
00:35:51,504 --> 00:35:54,098
You're right.
I'm sorry about that.

927
00:35:54,173 --> 00:35:57,540
You know what, girl to girl,
you're gettin' a little hippy.

928
00:35:57,610 --> 00:35:59,168
You might wanna cut back
on the pasta.

929
00:36:01,247 --> 00:36:02,236
All right, what do you want?

930
00:36:02,315 --> 00:36:04,374
I'm serious. Why are you here?

931
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:05,678
Look, we got off
on the wrong foot...

932
00:36:05,751 --> 00:36:07,582
and that's partly my fault...

933
00:36:07,653 --> 00:36:09,177
with the threats
from beyond and all.

934
00:36:09,255 --> 00:36:10,552
- Yeah.
- But here's the thing.

935
00:36:10,623 --> 00:36:12,853
I was sent back to earth
to protect Henry.

936
00:36:12,925 --> 00:36:14,790
Really? How do you know that?

937
00:36:14,861 --> 00:36:18,126
Because when you die,
you go to this white room...

938
00:36:18,197 --> 00:36:21,894
and there's a woman who may
or may not be an angel...

939
00:36:21,968 --> 00:36:26,428
and she says that, you know,
just, you know...

940
00:36:26,506 --> 00:36:28,337
stuff, and I just know.

941
00:36:29,909 --> 00:36:32,434
So, like, I have to like
stay away from Henry now?

942
00:36:32,512 --> 00:36:35,106
Oh, that would be so great.
Thank you.

943
00:36:37,183 --> 00:36:38,741
Wait a second.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

944
00:36:38,818 --> 00:36:40,251
But you're dead.

945
00:36:40,319 --> 00:36:41,877
I still don't want you
to see him.

946
00:36:41,954 --> 00:36:43,387
Yeah, I know,
but for argument's sake...

947
00:36:43,456 --> 00:36:44,548
I mean,
if I wanted to see him...

948
00:36:44,624 --> 00:36:46,182
there's not a whole hell
of a lot you could do about it.

949
00:36:46,259 --> 00:36:47,283
Really?

950
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:50,158
Then why have you been hiding
in your bedroom for a week?

951
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:52,190
Well, I'm done hiding.

952
00:36:52,265 --> 00:36:53,698
Let's not let this get ugly.

953
00:36:53,766 --> 00:36:54,733
I think it already has.

954
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,062
You have no idea.

955
00:36:58,971 --> 00:36:59,995
Ashley?

956
00:37:00,072 --> 00:37:01,801
Hi, Henry.

957
00:37:01,874 --> 00:37:03,239
Oh, sorry.

958
00:37:03,309 --> 00:37:04,298
"Dr. Mills."

959
00:37:04,377 --> 00:37:06,242
Oh, hey, you're alive.

960
00:37:06,312 --> 00:37:07,677
Yeah, thanks to you.

961
00:37:10,349 --> 00:37:11,373
You're a real lifesaver.

962
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:12,417
Know... You know,
the food that you left me...

963
00:37:12,485 --> 00:37:13,952
was the only thing
that kept me going.

964
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:15,248
Oh, you got that. Good.

965
00:37:15,321 --> 00:37:16,754
I left a couple
of messages, but...

966
00:37:16,822 --> 00:37:18,949
I know. I'm so sorry.
I, um...

967
00:37:19,025 --> 00:37:21,357
I just... I felt so ill
that I couldn't talk to anyone.

968
00:37:21,427 --> 00:37:22,394
But the minute I felt better...

969
00:37:22,461 --> 00:37:24,725
I wanted to come down here
and thank you in person.

970
00:37:24,797 --> 00:37:26,059
I hope you're not mad at me.

971
00:37:26,132 --> 00:37:27,759
No, not at all. I...

972
00:37:27,833 --> 00:37:29,494
I'm sorry that I called
and bothered you.

973
00:37:29,569 --> 00:37:31,161
I mean, you said that you'd call
when you felt better...

974
00:37:31,237 --> 00:37:32,795
and here you are.

975
00:37:32,872 --> 00:37:34,271
Do you wanna go out tonight?

976
00:37:38,044 --> 00:37:39,909
Yeah. All right. I'd love to.

977
00:37:39,979 --> 00:37:41,537
Okay, great.

978
00:37:41,614 --> 00:37:43,104
Oh, great. Oh, great.

979
00:37:43,182 --> 00:37:45,616
I'll let you get back
to saving animals' lives...

980
00:37:45,685 --> 00:37:47,209
and everything.

981
00:37:47,286 --> 00:37:48,446
Okay.

982
00:37:57,396 --> 00:37:59,125
And what seems to be
the trouble with Margaret?

983
00:37:59,198 --> 00:38:00,597
Itchy ass.

984
00:38:00,666 --> 00:38:01,860
Excellent.

985
00:38:18,951 --> 00:38:19,918
Oh!

986
00:38:19,986 --> 00:38:21,613
Oh, God!

987
00:38:22,922 --> 00:38:23,889
Ashley, hello.

988
00:38:23,956 --> 00:38:25,321
What was that crash?
I heard a crash.

989
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:27,719
- Ashley, hello.
- Shit.

990
00:38:27,793 --> 00:38:29,124
What is going on?
Is there someone there?

991
00:38:29,195 --> 00:38:30,162
Is someone at your place?

992
00:38:30,229 --> 00:38:31,196
- Hello.
- You know what...

993
00:38:31,263 --> 00:38:33,094
- Hello!
- I'm callin' the police.

994
00:38:33,165 --> 00:38:34,792
I'm giving you ten seconds
to pick up.

995
00:38:34,867 --> 00:38:39,736
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,
five, four, three, two, one.

996
00:38:39,805 --> 00:38:41,500
Dan. Sorry.

997
00:38:41,574 --> 00:38:43,041
The phone scared me,
so I killed it.

998
00:38:43,109 --> 00:38:44,940
What's going on?
Where have you been?

999
00:38:45,011 --> 00:38:46,911
- Why haven't you talked to me?
- It's a long story.

1000
00:38:46,979 --> 00:38:48,105
I've got time.

1001
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:49,408
I... I can't talk right now.

1002
00:38:49,482 --> 00:38:50,449
Why don't you
come over tomorrow...

1003
00:38:50,516 --> 00:38:51,778
we'll work on the Spencer party.
I got to go.

1004
00:38:51,851 --> 00:38:52,909
Where are you off to?

1005
00:38:52,985 --> 00:38:54,577
The gym. Okay?
I got to go. Bye.

1006
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,654
- Oh, wait, Dan!
- Yeah?

1007
00:38:56,722 --> 00:38:58,087
Would you say I'm hippy?

1008
00:38:58,991 --> 00:39:01,289
# Goddess on the mountain top #

1009
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:04,124
# Burning like a silver flame #

1010
00:39:04,196 --> 00:39:06,824
# The summit
of beauty and love #

1011
00:39:06,899 --> 00:39:08,093
# And Venus was her name #

1012
00:39:08,167 --> 00:39:09,532
# Whoa #

1013
00:39:11,237 --> 00:39:12,898
There's a gas leak
in the building.

1014
00:39:12,972 --> 00:39:14,735
Everyone get out now.

1015
00:39:14,807 --> 00:39:16,069
This is an emergency.

1016
00:39:20,946 --> 00:39:22,504
It'll be fine
if we just don't freak out!

1017
00:39:22,581 --> 00:39:24,139
It's all right! It's okay!

1018
00:39:24,216 --> 00:39:26,184
We'll be right
if we just stay cool!

1019
00:39:26,252 --> 00:39:28,618
Just stay cool, guys!
Just don't light a match!

1020
00:39:30,923 --> 00:39:32,413
What... Everyone out!

1021
00:39:34,894 --> 00:39:35,861
Oh, no.

1022
00:39:35,928 --> 00:39:37,259
- Miss?
- The...

1023
00:39:37,329 --> 00:39:38,887
It was just the P.A.

1024
00:39:40,099 --> 00:39:41,293
Was there an announcement
on the P. A?

1025
00:39:42,735 --> 00:39:43,929
What P. A?

1026
00:39:44,003 --> 00:39:48,064
Stairmaster's open,
you know, for your... Mm-hmm.

1027
00:39:48,708 --> 00:39:50,733
Miss.

1028
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:53,370
Yeah. I was just...

1029
00:39:53,446 --> 00:39:55,812
Well, look at me, hmm?

1030
00:39:55,881 --> 00:39:57,576
Naked in there, okay.

1031
00:39:57,650 --> 00:39:59,777
Just kidding.
Sorry about that, you guys.

1032
00:39:59,852 --> 00:40:01,149
I'm crazy.

1033
00:40:04,623 --> 00:40:05,817
So, do you have any idea
where you wanna eat?

1034
00:40:05,891 --> 00:40:06,858
Um, no.

1035
00:40:06,926 --> 00:40:08,621
I mean, if you have a place...
some place in mind or...

1036
00:40:08,694 --> 00:40:10,355
No, it's your treat,
so, you know...

1037
00:40:10,429 --> 00:40:11,396
I'm gonna let you choose.

1038
00:40:11,464 --> 00:40:15,161
Oh, well, in that case, I just...
I know just the place, actually.

1039
00:40:15,835 --> 00:40:16,961
No, I was... I was kidding.

1040
00:40:17,036 --> 00:40:18,003
Do you wanna get some seafood?

1041
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:19,196
Oh, no, no, big talker...

1042
00:40:19,271 --> 00:40:21,239
you're now gonna eat
a hot dog out of a cart.

1043
00:40:22,541 --> 00:40:24,168
- Hey.
- Sor... Oh, sorry.

1044
00:40:24,243 --> 00:40:25,904
Uh, one Italian sausage.

1045
00:40:26,679 --> 00:40:28,442
- Thank you.
- No, make it two.

1046
00:40:28,514 --> 00:40:29,981
If you're sure you wouldn't
rather have seafood.

1047
00:40:30,049 --> 00:40:31,448
No, we're...
No, we're fine with the two.

1048
00:40:31,517 --> 00:40:33,007
Two Italian sausage.
Thank you.

1049
00:40:36,188 --> 00:40:37,985
Are you going to treat me
to a funnel cake, too?

1050
00:40:38,057 --> 00:40:39,422
Only if you're a good boy.

1051
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,288
Watch out for that.

1052
00:40:43,963 --> 00:40:46,329
Stop it, please.
It's really not funny.

1053
00:40:46,398 --> 00:40:48,025
No, you're right.
That's horrible.

1054
00:40:51,971 --> 00:40:54,201
Stop, 'cause if you wanna play,
I'll play that game.

1055
00:40:54,273 --> 00:40:55,604
You wanna play that game?

1056
00:40:55,674 --> 00:40:57,539
Oh, my God! Oh!

1057
00:40:57,610 --> 00:40:59,840
Ohh!

1058
00:40:59,912 --> 00:41:01,277
Oh.

1059
00:41:01,347 --> 00:41:02,371
Let me just...

1060
00:41:09,989 --> 00:41:11,251
You got a little somethin', uh...

1061
00:41:12,992 --> 00:41:14,254
I can't believe
you're not embarrassed...

1062
00:41:14,326 --> 00:41:16,226
to be seen with me right now.

1063
00:41:16,295 --> 00:41:17,762
Oh, God, no, no, I totally am.

1064
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:18,922
- Oh.
- Yeah.

1065
00:41:18,998 --> 00:41:20,431
If I run into anybody
that I know...

1066
00:41:20,499 --> 00:41:22,160
I'm gonna pretend
you're a German tourist.

1067
00:41:22,935 --> 00:41:24,300
I don't wanna be associated
with you.

1068
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:25,462
Do you know any German?

1069
00:41:25,871 --> 00:41:28,965
Uh... Ich machen dachen
zeit yachen...

1070
00:41:29,041 --> 00:41:30,975
tick wagen
fahr Fig Newton...

1071
00:41:31,043 --> 00:41:32,874
in BMW en zag.

1072
00:41:32,945 --> 00:41:34,276
It's kinda like
a Swedish German.

1073
00:41:34,346 --> 00:41:35,608
- Yeah.
- Nice.

1074
00:41:35,681 --> 00:41:36,705
- It's not. Yeah.
- It's good.

1075
00:41:36,782 --> 00:41:38,750
Yes, no, I think the bathrooms
are over there...

1076
00:41:38,818 --> 00:41:41,582
German lady,
who's from also Sweden...

1077
00:41:41,654 --> 00:41:42,712
that I don't even know.

1078
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:46,080
Hey, I feel kind of weird
bringing this up...

1079
00:41:46,158 --> 00:41:48,718
but have you thought
about Kate lately?

1080
00:41:50,763 --> 00:41:53,926
Um, yeah, not really.

1081
00:41:53,999 --> 00:41:56,194
I mean, you know
how I feel about all that...

1082
00:41:56,268 --> 00:41:58,759
but you said
some pretty amazing things.

1083
00:41:58,838 --> 00:42:00,533
Can I ask you a question?

1084
00:42:00,606 --> 00:42:01,698
Sure.

1085
00:42:02,708 --> 00:42:04,972
Um, there's no right
or wrong answer to this...

1086
00:42:05,044 --> 00:42:08,377
so you can just be honest,
but, um, are we...

1087
00:42:09,181 --> 00:42:11,513
Are we out to talk about Kate...

1088
00:42:11,584 --> 00:42:15,748
or-or are we,
you know, just out?

1089
00:42:15,821 --> 00:42:18,619
Because, either way
is totally fine with me.

1090
00:42:18,691 --> 00:42:21,353
I just... If it's both...

1091
00:42:22,728 --> 00:42:26,220
then it probably gets, like,
a little complicated for me.

1092
00:42:26,999 --> 00:42:29,433
Yeah, I was kind of wondering
the same thing, actually.

1093
00:42:29,501 --> 00:42:31,833
I mean, are we out
because I'm your client...

1094
00:42:31,904 --> 00:42:33,929
or are we out?

1095
00:42:58,664 --> 00:43:00,222
Oh, great, I'm your client.

1096
00:43:03,269 --> 00:43:04,293
That sucks.

1097
00:43:09,541 --> 00:43:10,508
I had a good time.

1098
00:43:10,576 --> 00:43:11,736
Me, too.

1099
00:43:13,479 --> 00:43:14,537
I'll call you tomorrow.

1100
00:43:14,613 --> 00:43:15,705
Okay, you don't have to.

1101
00:43:15,781 --> 00:43:16,839
No, I want to.

1102
00:43:16,916 --> 00:43:19,180
Okay. Okay, me, too.

1103
00:43:20,152 --> 00:43:21,176
Okay.

1104
00:43:24,223 --> 00:43:25,247
Bye.

1105
00:43:42,808 --> 00:43:44,241
Forgetting something?

1106
00:43:44,843 --> 00:43:47,505
Was I somehow unclear
about what I wanted you to do?

1107
00:43:48,414 --> 00:43:49,972
Oh, were you expecting Henry?

1108
00:43:50,049 --> 00:43:52,984
I was hoping.
He's quite a kisser.

1109
00:43:53,052 --> 00:43:54,610
You're really gonna
throw that in my face?

1110
00:43:54,687 --> 00:43:56,382
Isn't that tactic
a little beneath you?

1111
00:43:56,455 --> 00:43:57,422
You're one to talk!

1112
00:43:57,489 --> 00:44:00,014
I had to show a room
full of guys my naked breasts...

1113
00:44:00,092 --> 00:44:01,320
because of you!

1114
00:44:04,029 --> 00:44:06,691
That's a nice gesture,
but unnecessary, dear.

1115
00:44:06,765 --> 00:44:08,528
Oh, I was... Um...

1116
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:09,897
Good night.

1117
00:44:13,772 --> 00:44:15,364
Bingo, come on.

1118
00:44:15,441 --> 00:44:16,408
That dog just sniffed you.

1119
00:44:16,475 --> 00:44:18,375
God, I think
the animals can see you.

1120
00:44:18,444 --> 00:44:19,468
That is so cool.

1121
00:44:19,545 --> 00:44:20,534
That's great.

1122
00:44:20,612 --> 00:44:22,239
Wonder how I can use that
against you?

1123
00:44:22,314 --> 00:44:23,281
Hey, I showed it to you.

1124
00:44:23,349 --> 00:44:24,748
Yeah, that was dumb.

1125
00:44:26,051 --> 00:44:27,018
I don't understand.

1126
00:44:27,086 --> 00:44:29,452
If you weren't sick,
then what was the problem?

1127
00:44:29,521 --> 00:44:30,488
I can't get into it...

1128
00:44:30,556 --> 00:44:31,784
because you're
gonna think I'm crazy.

1129
00:44:31,857 --> 00:44:32,824
No, no, no. I'll hide it.

1130
00:44:32,891 --> 00:44:35,951
I promise, I'll look at you
really sincerely and say...

1131
00:44:36,028 --> 00:44:37,359
"I understand."

1132
00:44:39,498 --> 00:44:41,989
- Okay. Fine.
- Good.

1133
00:44:42,067 --> 00:44:43,329
You remember Henry, right?

1134
00:44:43,402 --> 00:44:44,767
Yeah, yeah.
The guy with the wife...

1135
00:44:44,837 --> 00:44:45,929
that was the crushed
by the angel.

1136
00:44:46,005 --> 00:44:47,495
Right. I saw her.

1137
00:44:49,375 --> 00:44:51,570
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

1138
00:44:51,643 --> 00:44:55,374
Uh, now,
when you say, uh, you saw her...

1139
00:44:57,116 --> 00:44:58,174
you mean you saw...

1140
00:44:58,250 --> 00:44:59,979
- Her ghost, yes.
- Mm.

1141
00:45:00,052 --> 00:45:01,679
Yeah, she's been hassling me.

1142
00:45:01,754 --> 00:45:03,016
I understand.

1143
00:45:03,088 --> 00:45:05,147
No, Dan, this is not a joke.

1144
00:45:05,224 --> 00:45:07,055
Look, I've heard voices
before and stuff like that...

1145
00:45:07,126 --> 00:45:08,650
but I've actually seen her.

1146
00:45:08,727 --> 00:45:09,853
Do you see her right now?

1147
00:45:09,928 --> 00:45:11,293
No, I only see her
when she wants me to see her...

1148
00:45:11,363 --> 00:45:12,557
I think. I don't know.

1149
00:45:13,665 --> 00:45:15,155
You know what?
Never mind. I'm kidding.

1150
00:45:15,234 --> 00:45:16,724
I seriously was kidding.
I totally made that up.

1151
00:45:16,802 --> 00:45:17,928
Let's cook. I bought salmon.

1152
00:45:18,003 --> 00:45:19,903
You... You really believe this,
don't you?

1153
00:45:19,972 --> 00:45:21,030
It's really happening.

1154
00:45:21,106 --> 00:45:23,506
And it's only you.
No one else can see or hear her?

1155
00:45:23,575 --> 00:45:25,372
Yeah. I don't know why I'm
the only one who can see her.

1156
00:45:25,444 --> 00:45:27,435
Maybe because I'm after the guy
she was supposed to marry.

1157
00:45:27,513 --> 00:45:29,140
Maybe that's sufficient
motivation for her...

1158
00:45:29,214 --> 00:45:30,579
to come back from the dead.
I don't know.

1159
00:45:30,649 --> 00:45:33,243
I note that
during your little rant...

1160
00:45:33,318 --> 00:45:36,219
defending your sanity,
you admit you're after him.

1161
00:45:39,525 --> 00:45:40,719
Well, yeah, I mean,
we're like...

1162
00:45:40,793 --> 00:45:42,590
We're like... We're
sort of dating or whatever.

1163
00:45:43,462 --> 00:45:44,486
Ashley.

1164
00:45:45,864 --> 00:45:48,059
No, I don't want
a reality check.

1165
00:45:48,133 --> 00:45:49,896
This is what happens
when you lie...

1166
00:45:49,968 --> 00:45:51,868
about talking
to a man's dead fiancée.

1167
00:45:51,937 --> 00:45:52,995
I've seen it a thousand times.

1168
00:45:53,072 --> 00:45:54,801
No, because I'm not lying, okay?

1169
00:45:54,873 --> 00:45:56,898
I can actually talk to her.
That's different.

1170
00:45:56,975 --> 00:45:58,806
Okay, I was lying before...

1171
00:45:58,877 --> 00:45:59,969
because I actually
couldn't talk to her.

1172
00:46:00,045 --> 00:46:01,740
And also, admittedly...

1173
00:46:01,814 --> 00:46:03,247
I lied to you
about being interested in him.

1174
00:46:03,315 --> 00:46:04,475
So I am sorry about that.

1175
00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:05,539
Yeah, listen,
while you work that out...

1176
00:46:05,617 --> 00:46:07,482
maybe this can bubble
into your subconscious.

1177
00:46:07,553 --> 00:46:08,781
Run away!

1178
00:46:08,854 --> 00:46:10,685
I mean, you have dated guys
with every problem there is...

1179
00:46:10,756 --> 00:46:13,156
but this one, apparently,
has a ghost?

1180
00:46:13,225 --> 00:46:14,886
Yeah, but it's not his fault
his fiancée's haunting me.

1181
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:15,112
Mm.

1182
00:46:15,113 --> 00:46:17,292
Look, it's impossible
to find a great guy...

1183
00:46:17,362 --> 00:46:18,659
and I'm not gonna
let a little thing...

1184
00:46:18,730 --> 00:46:19,924
like a ghost stop me, okay?

1185
00:46:19,998 --> 00:46:21,397
I'm not gonna let her win.

1186
00:46:21,467 --> 00:46:22,434
You mean her ghost?

1187
00:46:22,501 --> 00:46:23,627
- Right.
- I understand.

1188
00:46:23,702 --> 00:46:25,135
I'm going to the market.
Bone the fish.

1189
00:46:40,619 --> 00:46:42,484
Are you all right?
Why are you screaming?

1190
00:46:43,422 --> 00:46:44,821
No, I wasn't.

1191
00:46:44,890 --> 00:46:45,982
I was... I was singing.

1192
00:46:48,427 --> 00:46:49,485
Thanks.

1193
00:46:56,668 --> 00:46:57,794
Father Marks?

1194
00:46:57,870 --> 00:46:58,837
Ashley.

1195
00:46:58,904 --> 00:46:59,962
That's me.

1196
00:47:00,038 --> 00:47:03,735
I haven't seen you in,
what's it been, ten years?

1197
00:47:03,809 --> 00:47:06,243
I've been
to a few Christmas services.

1198
00:47:06,311 --> 00:47:08,677
Well, next Christmas, why don't
you come up and say hello?

1199
00:47:08,747 --> 00:47:10,840
Absolutely.
I will put that in my calendar.

1200
00:47:10,916 --> 00:47:12,508
December the 25th.

1201
00:47:12,584 --> 00:47:14,279
Got it.

1202
00:47:14,353 --> 00:47:15,411
Well, you didn't come here...

1203
00:47:15,487 --> 00:47:17,978
so I could make you squirm
about your attendance.

1204
00:47:18,056 --> 00:47:19,216
Now that you mention it.

1205
00:47:20,225 --> 00:47:25,595
Um... Father, um, I've... I've...

1206
00:47:25,664 --> 00:47:26,995
I've had an encounter...

1207
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:30,500
encounters with a ghost.

1208
00:47:30,569 --> 00:47:31,797
Well, you musn't be
completely surprised...

1209
00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:33,667
that this is happening to you.

1210
00:47:33,739 --> 00:47:34,967
I mean, if you dabble
with the occult...

1211
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,474
you're bound to get
these kind of incidents.

1212
00:47:37,543 --> 00:47:38,942
- I know.
- Well, all right.

1213
00:47:39,011 --> 00:47:40,842
You're not here
to get a lecture from me.

1214
00:47:40,913 --> 00:47:42,403
So why did you come here?

1215
00:47:44,349 --> 00:47:45,577
I want you to get rid of her.

1216
00:47:47,686 --> 00:47:49,847
Do you see the ghost now?

1217
00:47:49,922 --> 00:47:50,889
No.

1218
00:47:50,956 --> 00:47:53,857
And this room is where
you've seen her the most?

1219
00:47:53,926 --> 00:47:55,416
Definitely.
This is definitely the room...

1220
00:47:55,494 --> 00:47:56,825
where I see her most.

1221
00:47:59,565 --> 00:48:01,726
So, uh, is there a script
for this sort of thing?

1222
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,927
For exorcism? Oh sure, sure.

1223
00:48:04,002 --> 00:48:05,230
No, when you're
casting out spirits...

1224
00:48:05,304 --> 00:48:07,738
the Church doesn't really
like us to wing it.

1225
00:48:07,806 --> 00:48:09,000
Right. Of course.

1226
00:48:11,343 --> 00:48:13,106
- Shall we?
- Yes.

1227
00:48:13,178 --> 00:48:14,702
Yes.

1228
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:17,544
"I address thee, spirit,
in the name of the Father...

1229
00:48:17,616 --> 00:48:20,380
"and of the Son
and of the Holy Spirit.

1230
00:48:20,452 --> 00:48:23,421
"Come out
and leave this servant of God."

1231
00:48:23,488 --> 00:48:24,887
You don't really believe
this is gonna work.

1232
00:48:24,957 --> 00:48:26,549
I see her. She's right there.

1233
00:48:29,294 --> 00:48:31,694
"It is time
for your soul to pass on.

1234
00:48:31,763 --> 00:48:34,732
"Hear the command
of God himself...

1235
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:35,960
"who did
walk upon the sea...

1236
00:48:36,034 --> 00:48:37,797
"and extend his right hand
to Peter."

1237
00:48:37,869 --> 00:48:40,269
You really don't believe
in all this hocus-pocus, do you?

1238
00:48:40,339 --> 00:48:42,330
"In the name of God, the
Almighty Father...

1239
00:48:42,407 --> 00:48:44,602
- "that thou depart..."
- Oh, that's not good.

1240
00:48:44,676 --> 00:48:46,439
It's working. It's working.

1241
00:48:46,511 --> 00:48:48,411
Uh, okay, Ashley, listen.

1242
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:51,176
I've been reconsidering,
and I think we can come...

1243
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:53,343
- to some sort of understanding.
- "Let the Holy Spirit...

1244
00:48:53,418 --> 00:48:54,715
"dwell therein."

1245
00:48:54,786 --> 00:48:56,413
Okay, uh, s-s-some of the...

1246
00:48:56,488 --> 00:48:58,956
some of the things I did,
a little out of hand...

1247
00:48:59,024 --> 00:49:01,754
and I'd like to take
this opportunity to apologize.

1248
00:49:01,827 --> 00:49:05,422
You know, the whole naked
in the gym thing, not cool.

1249
00:49:05,497 --> 00:49:06,521
I get it now.

1250
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,693
- What's happening?
- "Therefore, restless spirit...

1251
00:49:10,769 --> 00:49:11,758
Oh, make it stop!

1252
00:49:11,837 --> 00:49:13,862
"acknowledge
that your time has ended."

1253
00:49:13,939 --> 00:49:17,067
Please, I don't wanna go.
I don't wanna go!

1254
00:49:21,146 --> 00:49:22,170
She's gone.

1255
00:49:25,317 --> 00:49:26,341
Yeah.

1256
00:49:27,719 --> 00:49:28,981
You did it.

1257
00:49:29,054 --> 00:49:30,453
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1258
00:49:30,522 --> 00:49:32,888
I'm... I'm... I'm sure.

1259
00:49:32,958 --> 00:49:33,982
She was right there...

1260
00:49:35,294 --> 00:49:36,989
and then she vanished.

1261
00:49:37,062 --> 00:49:38,495
Well, bugger me.

1262
00:49:39,831 --> 00:49:40,855
Good.

1263
00:49:41,867 --> 00:49:43,494
- Good.
- Very good.

1264
00:49:45,771 --> 00:49:49,935
So, you're, uh, finished
with your psychic work?

1265
00:49:50,008 --> 00:49:51,942
Oh, yeah. I mean, it's over.

1266
00:49:52,010 --> 00:49:54,604
And we'll see you in church
on a regular basis?

1267
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:56,204
We didn't agree to that
before we started.

1268
00:49:56,281 --> 00:49:57,805
Oh, I'll bring her back.

1269
00:49:58,717 --> 00:50:00,082
It's a deal. It's a deal.
I promise.

1270
00:50:00,152 --> 00:50:02,450
Okay. No more of these games.

1271
00:50:02,521 --> 00:50:04,352
- I know. I'm sorry.
- Take care of yourself...

1272
00:50:04,423 --> 00:50:05,390
- Ashley Clark.
- Bye-bye.

1273
00:50:07,759 --> 00:50:09,317
He sounded so serious.

1274
00:50:09,394 --> 00:50:11,328
No! No!

1275
00:50:11,396 --> 00:50:12,420
Did you like
that disappearing thing?

1276
00:50:12,497 --> 00:50:13,486
I just made that up.

1277
00:50:13,565 --> 00:50:14,998
I didn't even know
I could do that before now.

1278
00:50:15,701 --> 00:50:17,669
Okay, time to get to work.

1279
00:50:17,736 --> 00:50:20,637
Tonight, instead of sleeping,
I thought I'd tell you...

1280
00:50:20,706 --> 00:50:23,766
all the stories
of all the pets I've ever owned.

1281
00:50:24,643 --> 00:50:26,770
- Oh, people love pet stories.
- Just... Just...

1282
00:50:26,845 --> 00:50:29,370
So, I'm gonna start
with the first pet I ever had.

1283
00:50:29,448 --> 00:50:32,713
It was a turtle named Ernie,
and I must've been eight.

1284
00:50:32,784 --> 00:50:34,046
She actually had kittens.

1285
00:50:34,119 --> 00:50:35,746
She had baby kittens,
and then we named them all.

1286
00:50:35,821 --> 00:50:38,517
And we used to call him Boots,
because he was all white...

1287
00:50:38,590 --> 00:50:39,955
and he had these little black...

1288
00:50:40,025 --> 00:50:41,856
- Boots?
- Exactly.

1289
00:50:41,927 --> 00:50:45,454
At least that's what we called
him until "he" had kittens.

1290
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:47,691
Then we named him Mrs. Piggy.

1291
00:50:47,766 --> 00:50:50,792
And there were six kittens.
What were their names?

1292
00:50:55,907 --> 00:50:56,965
Was that you?

1293
00:50:57,809 --> 00:50:59,174
The doorbell?

1294
00:50:59,244 --> 00:51:00,711
Yeah, that was me.
Don't answer that.

1295
00:51:14,092 --> 00:51:15,992
I remember the kittens' names!

1296
00:51:16,061 --> 00:51:19,326
It was Willy, Betty, Whiskers...

1297
00:51:19,398 --> 00:51:21,229
Fang, Teddy, and Nugget!

1298
00:51:21,299 --> 00:51:23,893
And then there was Buffy,
who was my last dog.

1299
00:51:23,969 --> 00:51:25,596
But after he died, that was it.

1300
00:51:26,838 --> 00:51:28,271
God, I think that's all my pets.

1301
00:51:28,907 --> 00:51:30,272
You should get some sleep.

1302
00:51:30,342 --> 00:51:32,037
Mmm... thank you.

1303
00:51:36,148 --> 00:51:37,376
Good morning.

1304
00:51:37,449 --> 00:51:39,644
- The time is 7 A.M.
- You have a busy day in front of you...

1305
00:51:39,718 --> 00:51:41,185
- Good morning, everyone.
- so I thought you might like to hear...

1306
00:51:41,253 --> 00:51:43,517
all my favorite colors
and numbers.

1307
00:51:43,588 --> 00:51:47,115
- Blue, seven, seventeen...
- Good morning, everyone! Well...

1308
00:51:47,192 --> 00:51:51,629
Lime green, forest green,
yellow, one, blue.

1309
00:51:51,696 --> 00:51:53,630
Oh, crap,
did I already say blue?

1310
00:51:53,698 --> 00:51:55,723
You know what?
I'm gonna start over.

1311
00:51:56,268 --> 00:51:57,963
- Blue.
- Ow!

1312
00:51:58,036 --> 00:52:00,027
Oh, God!

1313
00:52:01,239 --> 00:52:03,537
Gettin' tired? Unable to
function?

1314
00:52:04,543 --> 00:52:05,635
I'm fine.

1315
00:52:05,710 --> 00:52:06,677
You know,
you really should think...

1316
00:52:06,745 --> 00:52:08,076
about what you're
getting into here.

1317
00:52:08,146 --> 00:52:09,113
I don't need sleep.

1318
00:52:09,181 --> 00:52:11,240
I can hound you
every second of every day.

1319
00:52:11,316 --> 00:52:12,283
You're never gonna know...

1320
00:52:12,350 --> 00:52:13,817
if something you hear
is real or not.

1321
00:52:13,885 --> 00:52:15,716
I can keep you
from sleeping and eating...

1322
00:52:15,787 --> 00:52:17,118
- and drinking...
- Enough!

1323
00:52:17,189 --> 00:52:19,680
Enough, okay?
Congratulations, you win.

1324
00:52:21,493 --> 00:52:23,518
I love spending time with Henry,
but it's not worth it.

1325
00:52:24,963 --> 00:52:27,329
Good.
Then my work here is done.

1326
00:52:28,567 --> 00:52:29,829
But if you ever try
to see him again...

1327
00:52:29,901 --> 00:52:31,528
- You'll be back.
- You can count on it.

1328
00:52:31,603 --> 00:52:32,627
Go.

1329
00:52:33,805 --> 00:52:34,829
Hey, wait, Kate.

1330
00:52:35,841 --> 00:52:37,069
Look, is there, um...

1331
00:52:37,909 --> 00:52:39,376
Is there anything
you wanna tell him?

1332
00:52:40,011 --> 00:52:40,978
What do you mean?

1333
00:52:41,046 --> 00:52:42,809
Well, Henry came to me...

1334
00:52:42,881 --> 00:52:44,143
because he wanted
to talk to you...

1335
00:52:44,216 --> 00:52:47,049
and I definitely think
I can deliver on that.

1336
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:49,817
So is there anything
you wanna say to him?

1337
00:52:53,191 --> 00:52:55,921
Kate contacted me from beyond...

1338
00:52:56,895 --> 00:52:59,329
not like before, but clearer.

1339
00:52:59,898 --> 00:53:02,093
Clearer than anything
that I have ever experienced.

1340
00:53:02,167 --> 00:53:03,259
What did she say?

1341
00:53:05,036 --> 00:53:06,503
Hi, Henry.

1342
00:53:09,274 --> 00:53:11,333
She says, "Hi, Henry."

1343
00:53:13,011 --> 00:53:15,172
I know. Um, you know what?

1344
00:53:16,314 --> 00:53:18,009
Ask me questions.

1345
00:53:18,083 --> 00:53:22,747
Just, uh, ask me as
many questions as you'd like...

1346
00:53:22,821 --> 00:53:24,880
and just keep asking me
until you're convinced.

1347
00:53:26,024 --> 00:53:27,218
What was her favorite food?

1348
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:30,494
The three berry cake
at Sweet Lady Jane's.

1349
00:53:30,562 --> 00:53:32,325
She says ask a tough one.

1350
00:53:33,064 --> 00:53:36,397
Um, what was
her first pet's name?

1351
00:53:36,468 --> 00:53:38,902
Ernie the turtle.
She told me that earlier today.

1352
00:53:40,739 --> 00:53:42,070
Her favorite Hawaiian island?

1353
00:53:44,242 --> 00:53:47,700
She's only been to Maui, and
she got stung by a jellyfish.

1354
00:53:49,748 --> 00:53:50,976
You really, uh...

1355
00:53:52,951 --> 00:53:53,975
What else?

1356
00:53:55,654 --> 00:53:56,882
She always hated this chair.

1357
00:53:56,955 --> 00:54:00,015
Her second toes are slightly
longer than her first.

1358
00:54:00,091 --> 00:54:01,718
She always meant
to take guitar lessons.

1359
00:54:01,793 --> 00:54:04,227
Well, I...
Why did she come here?

1360
00:54:04,296 --> 00:54:05,888
I mean, what does
she wanna tell me?

1361
00:54:07,966 --> 00:54:09,524
She says that she can tell
that you're torn...

1362
00:54:09,601 --> 00:54:11,398
between being faithful
to her memory...

1363
00:54:11,469 --> 00:54:13,198
and the feelings
that you have for me.

1364
00:54:14,139 --> 00:54:15,265
The hell I did!

1365
00:54:16,007 --> 00:54:18,339
Ow! Oh! Ah!

1366
00:54:18,410 --> 00:54:20,640
- What happened?
- Seed in the eye! It's okay!

1367
00:54:20,712 --> 00:54:22,179
Tell him the truth!

1368
00:54:22,247 --> 00:54:24,681
She says she just wants you
to be happy, Henry...

1369
00:54:24,749 --> 00:54:27,115
and she can tell
that you're happier with me.

1370
00:54:28,053 --> 00:54:30,248
You are screwing
with the wrong woman.

1371
00:54:30,322 --> 00:54:32,688
That's it. I mean,
she wants you to move on.

1372
00:54:32,757 --> 00:54:34,748
Oh, she's gone.

1373
00:54:34,826 --> 00:54:35,793
No, I'm not!

1374
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:37,054
I'm right here!

1375
00:54:37,128 --> 00:54:38,686
I'm right here!

1376
00:54:38,763 --> 00:54:40,993
I'm gonna be with you
every second of every day...

1377
00:54:41,066 --> 00:54:42,294
for the rest of your life!

1378
00:54:42,367 --> 00:54:43,334
Tell her thank you.

1379
00:54:43,401 --> 00:54:45,926
Thank you, Kate,
wherever you are.

1380
00:54:46,905 --> 00:54:47,872
Are you okay?

1381
00:54:47,939 --> 00:54:49,930
You look at it, Doctor.

1382
00:54:50,008 --> 00:54:51,032
Oh!

1383
00:54:51,843 --> 00:54:52,810
It really hurts.

1384
00:54:52,877 --> 00:54:54,640
Good. I hope it blinds you.

1385
00:54:56,348 --> 00:54:57,781
What would I do without you?

1386
00:54:59,084 --> 00:55:01,348
You are so dead.

1387
00:55:01,419 --> 00:55:04,479
I, Andy Chris, take you,
Natalia Yeroshik...

1388
00:55:04,556 --> 00:55:06,023
as my best friend for life.

1389
00:55:06,091 --> 00:55:08,025
I pledge to honor, encourage...

1390
00:55:08,093 --> 00:55:09,651
- and support you...
- Oh, you know the Lerner party?

1391
00:55:09,728 --> 00:55:11,218
You're gonna have
to do that alone.

1392
00:55:11,296 --> 00:55:15,460
Where, uh...
Where are you gonna be?

1393
00:55:15,533 --> 00:55:17,467
Uh, I gotta... I gotta...

1394
00:55:17,535 --> 00:55:20,595
I gotta go away. I'm...
Some... I've got a thing.

1395
00:55:20,672 --> 00:55:21,696
With... With who?

1396
00:55:22,941 --> 00:55:23,908
Shh.

1397
00:55:23,975 --> 00:55:26,671
With Henry? With Henry.

1398
00:55:26,745 --> 00:55:28,337
This is my solemn vow.

1399
00:55:28,413 --> 00:55:32,372
From this moment,
I, Natalia Yeroshik...

1400
00:55:32,450 --> 00:55:33,417
take you, Andy Chris...

1401
00:55:33,485 --> 00:55:36,010
- What, Dan?
- Nothing. Nothing.

1402
00:55:36,087 --> 00:55:37,850
This is my solemn vow.

1403
00:55:37,922 --> 00:55:39,651
By the power vested in me...

1404
00:55:39,724 --> 00:55:42,921
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

1405
00:55:42,994 --> 00:55:44,393
You may kiss the bride.

1406
00:55:44,462 --> 00:55:46,020
Congratulations.

1407
00:55:46,097 --> 00:55:47,064
Yeah.

1408
00:55:47,132 --> 00:55:48,156
Yeah.

1409
00:55:50,935 --> 00:55:52,732
Three...

1410
00:55:52,804 --> 00:55:54,465
four...

1411
00:55:54,539 --> 00:55:56,063
five...

1412
00:55:56,141 --> 00:55:57,108
- six.
- Ashley.

1413
00:55:57,175 --> 00:55:59,336
Shh!

1414
00:55:59,411 --> 00:56:01,436
Okay, where was I? I was on...

1415
00:56:01,513 --> 00:56:03,276
- Three.
- Thank you.

1416
00:56:03,348 --> 00:56:04,679
For what?

1417
00:56:04,749 --> 00:56:08,708
Three, four, five...

1418
00:56:08,787 --> 00:56:13,190
six, seven, eight.

1419
00:56:15,026 --> 00:56:15,993
I have to say something.

1420
00:56:16,061 --> 00:56:19,053
Now, you know I never get
involved in your love life.

1421
00:56:19,130 --> 00:56:20,222
- Bullshit.
- Fine.

1422
00:56:20,298 --> 00:56:22,027
As someone who's always involved
in your love life...

1423
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:23,192
I think you should listen to me.

1424
00:56:23,268 --> 00:56:24,826
You're making a huge mistake.

1425
00:56:24,903 --> 00:56:26,234
No, I'm not.
Help me with the cart.

1426
00:56:26,304 --> 00:56:29,603
Okay, it's... It's not because
his fiancée's ghost...

1427
00:56:29,674 --> 00:56:32,108
is trying to drive you away,
and-and it's not because...

1428
00:56:32,177 --> 00:56:34,168
he's a client who you lie to...

1429
00:56:34,245 --> 00:56:36,372
but you talk about picking guys
with problems?

1430
00:56:36,448 --> 00:56:37,608
He just got out
of a relationship...

1431
00:56:37,682 --> 00:56:39,673
where his bride was killed
on their wedding day...

1432
00:56:39,751 --> 00:56:41,514
and you'll be the first girl
he dates.

1433
00:56:41,586 --> 00:56:43,611
That's a pretty serious rebound.

1434
00:56:43,688 --> 00:56:45,679
You really think
this is gonna end up well, huh?

1435
00:56:46,624 --> 00:56:49,149
Nice try. You're still handling
the Lerner party alone.

1436
00:56:50,762 --> 00:56:53,287
Ladies and gentlemen,
Cherries Jubilee.

1437
00:57:04,542 --> 00:57:06,510
Excuse me for a second.

1438
00:57:07,045 --> 00:57:08,842
I could feel the heat
all the way back here.

1439
00:57:08,913 --> 00:57:10,278
- Are you okay?
- You know, if I were dead...

1440
00:57:10,348 --> 00:57:12,578
I wouldn't be following around
one person, okay?

1441
00:57:12,650 --> 00:57:14,379
I'd be finding out
the meaning of life.

1442
00:57:14,452 --> 00:57:16,977
I would be talking to wise,
notable dead people.

1443
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:18,079
Oh, like who?

1444
00:57:18,156 --> 00:57:20,386
Um, like Eleanor Roosevelt.

1445
00:57:20,458 --> 00:57:21,425
What would you ask her?

1446
00:57:21,493 --> 00:57:22,755
Like, all kinds of things.

1447
00:57:22,827 --> 00:57:23,851
Like what?

1448
00:57:23,928 --> 00:57:25,395
Um...

1449
00:57:25,463 --> 00:57:26,430
All right,
forget Eleanor Roosevelt.

1450
00:57:26,498 --> 00:57:28,159
You're the only dead person
I wanna talk to right now.

1451
00:57:28,233 --> 00:57:30,599
Oh, I think you burned off
a little bit of your eyebrow.

1452
00:57:30,668 --> 00:57:32,226
What? Where?

1453
00:57:32,303 --> 00:57:33,361
Right... Right there.

1454
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:36,266
It's not gonna be even.

1455
00:57:37,275 --> 00:57:38,299
You know what? I don't care.

1456
00:57:38,376 --> 00:57:39,400
And you know what else?

1457
00:57:39,477 --> 00:57:40,739
I'm going away with Henry
this weekend...

1458
00:57:40,812 --> 00:57:42,609
whether you like it or not,
and I don't care what you do.

1459
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:45,114
I don't care if you set me
on fire or yell and scream...

1460
00:57:45,183 --> 00:57:47,174
and talk about your dog
or watch me while I piss!

1461
00:57:47,252 --> 00:57:49,243
I don't care! So if you're
trying to make me look insane...

1462
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:50,514
it's not working!

1463
00:57:54,359 --> 00:57:55,383
So...

1464
00:57:56,628 --> 00:57:58,289
who's ready for cake?

1465
00:57:59,798 --> 00:58:00,822
Oy.

1466
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:05,099
# I'll stop the world
and melt with you #

1467
00:58:07,872 --> 00:58:09,737
# You've seen the difference #

1468
00:58:09,808 --> 00:58:13,938
# And it's getting better
all the time #

1469
00:58:14,012 --> 00:58:15,348
# There's nothing you and I #

1470
00:58:15,349 --> 00:58:16,037
- Ha! No!
- Yeah.

1471
00:58:16,114 --> 00:58:17,138
- # Won't do #
- Oh, my God.

1472
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:19,410
- Pretty smooth.
- It is beautiful.

1473
00:58:19,484 --> 00:58:21,111
It's so weird
how much this place...

1474
00:58:21,186 --> 00:58:23,120
reminds me of my own apartment.

1475
00:58:25,223 --> 00:58:26,417
You know what we should do?

1476
00:58:26,491 --> 00:58:27,583
I saw some people
riding one of those...

1477
00:58:27,659 --> 00:58:28,921
like, two-person bikes.

1478
00:58:28,993 --> 00:58:30,551
We should totally rent
one of those.

1479
00:58:30,628 --> 00:58:31,686
Yeah, absolutely.

1480
00:58:31,763 --> 00:58:32,821
Okay, cool.

1481
00:58:33,998 --> 00:58:35,226
Now?

1482
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:37,029
Yeah, why not?

1483
00:58:37,101 --> 00:58:38,568
We just got here.

1484
00:58:38,636 --> 00:58:40,729
Don't you want to unpack,
check out the room?

1485
00:58:43,675 --> 00:58:46,007
Oh, my God.

1486
00:58:46,077 --> 00:58:47,305
Did you think
that you could just bring me...

1487
00:58:47,378 --> 00:58:48,811
up here and never leave
the room?

1488
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:50,780
Just put a "do not disturb" sign
on the door...

1489
00:58:50,849 --> 00:58:52,373
and lock ourselves
in for the weekend?

1490
00:58:52,450 --> 00:58:53,917
Um... yes?

1491
00:58:53,985 --> 00:58:55,247
Awesome.

1492
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:56,651
I'll go freshen up.

1493
00:59:46,237 --> 00:59:47,261
Henry?

1494
00:59:48,506 --> 00:59:49,905
Yes?

1495
00:59:49,974 --> 00:59:51,908
You know I'm still
in the room, right?

1496
00:59:51,976 --> 00:59:53,273
Yeah.

1497
00:59:55,647 --> 00:59:57,615
- Okay.
- Okay.

1498
01:00:15,533 --> 01:00:16,557
That was gross.

1499
01:00:17,802 --> 01:00:18,860
Are you all right?

1500
01:00:19,904 --> 01:00:21,098
I'm fine!

1501
01:00:22,273 --> 01:00:23,297
Okay.

1502
01:00:26,544 --> 01:00:27,943
I should've known it was you.

1503
01:00:28,012 --> 01:00:29,138
You know, I never thought
farts were funny...

1504
01:00:29,213 --> 01:00:31,841
when I was alive,
but the look on your face.

1505
01:00:31,916 --> 01:00:33,213
You get out of here.

1506
01:00:34,719 --> 01:00:36,482
You're not having sex
with my husband.

1507
01:00:37,655 --> 01:00:38,622
He is not your husband.

1508
01:00:38,690 --> 01:00:40,282
And even if you did make it
down that aisle...

1509
01:00:40,358 --> 01:00:43,225
there's still that
"till death do us part" clause.

1510
01:00:43,294 --> 01:00:44,591
You're a ghost!

1511
01:00:44,662 --> 01:00:45,788
Did you say something?

1512
01:00:46,898 --> 01:00:47,922
Yeah. The...

1513
01:00:49,701 --> 01:00:51,464
There's potpourri!

1514
01:00:51,536 --> 01:00:52,833
Don't do it!

1515
01:00:54,605 --> 01:00:55,663
Oh, I'm doin' it.

1516
01:01:02,613 --> 01:01:04,103
Oh, my God.

1517
01:01:04,182 --> 01:01:06,776
It looks even better
on the floor.

1518
01:01:08,686 --> 01:01:10,313
Best day ever.

1519
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:23,824
Wow, this is gonna be awkward.

1520
01:01:23,901 --> 01:01:25,095
Oh, my God!

1521
01:01:26,571 --> 01:01:27,697
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

1522
01:01:27,772 --> 01:01:29,763
I just, you know,
it's just, "Oh, my God."

1523
01:01:31,776 --> 01:01:33,869
I'm surprised he didn't spring
for the suite.

1524
01:01:35,346 --> 01:01:36,745
- Hey!
- Are you sure you're okay?

1525
01:01:36,814 --> 01:01:38,111
- How's it going down there?
- Why? Yeah.

1526
01:01:38,182 --> 01:01:39,410
- Yeah.
- Yoo-hoo!

1527
01:01:39,484 --> 01:01:41,679
It's just you're closing
your eyes very energetically.

1528
01:01:41,753 --> 01:01:42,720
I think you're freakin' him out.

1529
01:01:42,787 --> 01:01:44,812
Oh, you like to kiss with
your eyes open? That's cool.

1530
01:01:44,889 --> 01:01:46,220
I mean, that's kind of kinky,
but all right, all right.

1531
01:01:46,290 --> 01:01:47,450
- I'm cool with that.
- Being on the bottom...

1532
01:01:47,525 --> 01:01:48,787
not your most flattering angle.

1533
01:01:50,194 --> 01:01:51,559
I was talking to another ghost
the other day...

1534
01:01:51,629 --> 01:01:53,358
and you'll never guess
who it was.

1535
01:01:53,431 --> 01:01:54,523
Remember that guy you
used to date in high school...

1536
01:01:54,599 --> 01:01:56,396
who got killed
in a motorcycle accident?

1537
01:01:56,467 --> 01:01:57,525
Ted?

1538
01:01:57,602 --> 01:01:58,864
- What?
- What?

1539
01:01:58,936 --> 01:02:00,267
You said Ted.

1540
01:02:00,338 --> 01:02:01,805
No, I didn't.

1541
01:02:01,873 --> 01:02:04,034
I just... I, um...
'cause I bumped my arm.

1542
01:02:04,108 --> 01:02:05,075
I'm okay now.

1543
01:02:05,143 --> 01:02:07,202
Anyway, this is
a little embarrassing...

1544
01:02:07,278 --> 01:02:09,371
but he said
you were a bad kisser.

1545
01:02:09,447 --> 01:02:11,745
Actually, he said you were
the worst kisser ever.

1546
01:02:11,816 --> 01:02:13,443
"Painful and overly wet,"
was his exact quote.

1547
01:02:13,518 --> 01:02:15,509
He made a noise like this.

1548
01:02:15,586 --> 01:02:17,213
- Talk dirty to me.
- What?

1549
01:02:17,288 --> 01:02:19,119
Talk dirty to me.
I love it. It turns me on.

1550
01:02:19,190 --> 01:02:20,452
Henry doesn't like that.

1551
01:02:20,525 --> 01:02:21,685
Do it loud.

1552
01:02:21,759 --> 01:02:24,557
Um... Oh, you're a dirty girl,
aren't you?

1553
01:02:24,629 --> 01:02:25,960
She's a dirty little liar
is what she is.

1554
01:02:26,030 --> 01:02:27,588
Louder.

1555
01:02:27,665 --> 01:02:29,462
You're a dirty little thing.

1556
01:02:29,534 --> 01:02:30,523
You're a dirty girl...

1557
01:02:30,601 --> 01:02:32,466
- # I believe the children #
- aren't you?

1558
01:02:32,537 --> 01:02:33,936
- # Are our future #
- You're a dirty girl.

1559
01:02:34,005 --> 01:02:35,370
- Good, good. Louder though, louder.
- # Teach them well #

1560
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:37,100
Like... Like you're trying to
drown out some annoying noise

1561
01:02:37,101 --> 01:02:37,874
# And let them lead the way #

1562
01:02:37,942 --> 01:02:39,136
- # Show them all #
- Like this?!

1563
01:02:39,210 --> 01:02:40,199
- # The beauty #
- Yeah!

1564
01:02:40,278 --> 01:02:42,007
- # They possess inside #
- You're a dirty little girl, aren't you?

1565
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:43,911
- Louder, please!
- Aren't you a dirty little thing?!

1566
01:02:43,981 --> 01:02:45,005
You like the dirty stuff!

1567
01:02:45,083 --> 01:02:47,074
Aren't you a dirty...
That's just stupid.

1568
01:02:47,151 --> 01:02:48,277
I'm just yelling at you.

1569
01:02:50,988 --> 01:02:52,512
- Music!
- Is that annoying?

1570
01:02:56,794 --> 01:02:57,988
It's a little loud.

1571
01:02:58,062 --> 01:02:59,188
What?!

1572
01:02:59,263 --> 01:03:00,753
The music.
You like it this loud?

1573
01:03:00,832 --> 01:03:01,856
Oh, yeah, I love it.

1574
01:03:01,933 --> 01:03:03,628
Love this. Salsa.

1575
01:03:03,701 --> 01:03:05,692
Salsa makes me horny!

1576
01:03:10,808 --> 01:03:12,241
No, no, no, no!

1577
01:03:12,310 --> 01:03:13,504
Come on, just anything.

1578
01:03:13,578 --> 01:03:14,545
I like your hair!

1579
01:03:14,612 --> 01:03:15,738
Oh, God, I love it!

1580
01:03:15,813 --> 01:03:17,337
- It's looks really good!
- Louder!

1581
01:03:17,415 --> 01:03:18,507
Really?!

1582
01:03:21,452 --> 01:03:22,749
Sorry, sorry.

1583
01:03:22,820 --> 01:03:24,117
- Oh, hey.
- Hi.

1584
01:03:24,188 --> 01:03:25,655
- How you doin'?
- I'm good.

1585
01:03:26,491 --> 01:03:27,719
So, what's up?

1586
01:03:27,792 --> 01:03:29,419
You know that woman
you sent me to...

1587
01:03:29,494 --> 01:03:31,018
the, uh, psychic?

1588
01:03:31,095 --> 01:03:32,119
Believe me, you don't have
to whisper that...

1589
01:03:32,196 --> 01:03:33,163
in this neighborhood.

1590
01:03:33,231 --> 01:03:34,493
I mean, it's not like
I sent you to a...

1591
01:03:35,933 --> 01:03:36,991
Republican.

1592
01:03:38,369 --> 01:03:40,735
Well, She's, um... She's great.

1593
01:03:40,805 --> 01:03:43,000
I mean, really, I feel
a thousand times better.

1594
01:03:43,074 --> 01:03:45,167
Did she get a message from Kate?

1595
01:03:45,243 --> 01:03:47,336
Yeah, and I think that Kate
really wants me to move on.

1596
01:03:48,446 --> 01:03:49,538
In fact, I'm dating her.

1597
01:03:50,248 --> 01:03:51,215
Who?

1598
01:03:51,282 --> 01:03:52,442
Ashley.

1599
01:03:52,517 --> 01:03:53,984
Wait, so she told you
that Kate said...

1600
01:03:54,051 --> 01:03:55,746
that she wants you
to start dating again...

1601
01:03:55,820 --> 01:03:57,754
and then she went out with you?

1602
01:03:57,822 --> 01:03:59,414
Well, it didn't happen
exactly like that, but...

1603
01:03:59,490 --> 01:04:01,355
Oh, yeah,
I guess that is...

1604
01:04:01,425 --> 01:04:02,585
how it happened exactly, but...

1605
01:04:03,261 --> 01:04:04,285
Well, you got to stop.

1606
01:04:04,362 --> 01:04:05,659
Why?

1607
01:04:05,730 --> 01:04:06,924
She's a psychic.

1608
01:04:06,998 --> 01:04:08,556
Since when do you have
a problem with psychics?

1609
01:04:08,633 --> 01:04:09,691
I... You do.

1610
01:04:09,767 --> 01:04:11,200
You do. You hate them.

1611
01:04:11,269 --> 01:04:12,793
Look, Henry,
I think it's great...

1612
01:04:12,870 --> 01:04:16,499
that you're dating again,
but, I mean, you can't date her.

1613
01:04:17,241 --> 01:04:19,732
God, I thought
you'd be happy about this.

1614
01:04:20,745 --> 01:04:22,337
I guess, I-I should be.

1615
01:04:22,413 --> 01:04:24,881
I'm just... You're right.

1616
01:04:24,949 --> 01:04:26,541
I'm just surprised, I mean...

1617
01:04:26,617 --> 01:04:28,676
But I'm... I'm...
I'm coming around now.

1618
01:04:30,087 --> 01:04:33,318
I mean, look how happy I am now.

1619
01:04:33,391 --> 01:04:34,358
Chloe.

1620
01:04:34,425 --> 01:04:35,619
I've been meaning
to call you, actually.

1621
01:04:35,693 --> 01:04:36,887
What's been stopping you, huh?

1622
01:04:36,961 --> 01:04:38,622
Pretending to talk
to my brother's dead fiancée...

1623
01:04:38,696 --> 01:04:39,663
so you could date him?

1624
01:04:39,730 --> 01:04:40,992
Come on in.

1625
01:04:41,065 --> 01:04:42,498
No, I'm okay.

1626
01:04:42,567 --> 01:04:44,831
I just...
I want Kate's diary back.

1627
01:04:44,902 --> 01:04:47,598
Okay. Um... yeah.

1628
01:04:53,311 --> 01:04:55,609
I'm not gonna tell him
that I gave this to you...

1629
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:58,171
because, somehow,
he does seem better.

1630
01:04:58,249 --> 01:04:59,341
I know it looks bad.

1631
01:04:59,417 --> 01:05:00,543
How could you do this?

1632
01:05:00,618 --> 01:05:03,416
I mean, uh, "I can't fake it.
I'm not some scam artist."

1633
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:05,079
I mean, you totally
took advantage of him.

1634
01:05:05,156 --> 01:05:06,123
You asked me to do this.

1635
01:05:06,190 --> 01:05:08,021
Use fake psychic vision
to date him?

1636
01:05:08,092 --> 01:05:10,117
Let me think.
No, I'd remember that.

1637
01:05:11,162 --> 01:05:13,653
Chloe, I really, really care
about him.

1638
01:05:13,731 --> 01:05:15,062
Worst part is that I did this.

1639
01:05:15,132 --> 01:05:17,191
I mean, I gave this to you.

1640
01:05:17,268 --> 01:05:19,327
I handed you everything
that you needed.

1641
01:05:19,403 --> 01:05:20,597
You gave what to her?

1642
01:05:20,671 --> 01:05:22,639
No, what...
It's okay. Don't...

1643
01:05:23,407 --> 01:05:24,431
What's this?

1644
01:05:27,378 --> 01:05:28,470
This is Kate's diary.

1645
01:05:29,146 --> 01:05:30,113
Yeah.

1646
01:05:30,181 --> 01:05:31,239
Why would you give this to her?

1647
01:05:32,149 --> 01:05:33,343
How'd you even get it?

1648
01:05:38,723 --> 01:05:40,213
The story about the pancreas
is in here...

1649
01:05:40,291 --> 01:05:41,918
- Um...
- and how we met.

1650
01:05:47,665 --> 01:05:49,030
Henry. Henry!

1651
01:05:49,100 --> 01:05:50,124
Henry!

1652
01:05:57,808 --> 01:05:59,833
You were right.

1653
01:05:59,910 --> 01:06:04,074
It all fell apart, you know,
'cause I'm a horrible person.

1654
01:06:04,148 --> 01:06:06,275
No, no, you're not
a horrible person.

1655
01:06:06,350 --> 01:06:09,376
Yes, I am. I am.

1656
01:06:09,453 --> 01:06:12,354
I'm a liar,
and I'm a horrible person.

1657
01:06:12,423 --> 01:06:14,914
And you know what?
I never even deserved him.

1658
01:06:14,992 --> 01:06:16,220
- Okay, you... You kn...
- I didn't!

1659
01:06:16,294 --> 01:06:18,285
No, you know what?
He's an idiot to let you go.

1660
01:06:18,362 --> 01:06:19,351
- No!
- All right? No.

1661
01:06:19,430 --> 01:06:21,796
No matter what you did,
he's an idiot to let you go...

1662
01:06:21,866 --> 01:06:22,924
okay?

1663
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,729
Anyone would be lucky
to have you.

1664
01:06:24,802 --> 01:06:26,201
You're just saying that.

1665
01:06:26,270 --> 01:06:27,464
Anyone.

1666
01:06:38,182 --> 01:06:39,308
What the hell was that?

1667
01:06:39,383 --> 01:06:40,645
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1668
01:06:40,718 --> 01:06:42,049
You're my friend.

1669
01:06:42,119 --> 01:06:43,086
You're gay.

1670
01:06:43,154 --> 01:06:44,212
You're my gay friend.

1671
01:06:45,323 --> 01:06:47,052
Ah, screw it.

1672
01:06:47,124 --> 01:06:48,648
I'm not gay.

1673
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:50,727
What?

1674
01:06:50,795 --> 01:06:52,228
I'm not gay!

1675
01:06:52,296 --> 01:06:53,991
I've never been gay.

1676
01:06:54,065 --> 01:06:57,364
I don't have sex with men,
and they don't have sex with me.

1677
01:06:57,435 --> 01:06:58,925
Wow.

1678
01:06:59,003 --> 01:07:01,995
So when you just kissed me
just then, you were like...

1679
01:07:02,073 --> 01:07:03,563
I'm in love with you.

1680
01:07:03,641 --> 01:07:04,699
What?!

1681
01:07:04,775 --> 01:07:06,299
I've been in love with you
since I met you.

1682
01:07:06,377 --> 01:07:08,971
Every time you turn your back
to me, I sniff your hair.

1683
01:07:09,046 --> 01:07:11,480
I went into business with you,
so I could be near you.

1684
01:07:11,549 --> 01:07:12,538
I hate cooking!

1685
01:07:12,616 --> 01:07:14,709
I wanna throw up
every time I cut a fish.

1686
01:07:14,785 --> 01:07:16,753
God, you have got to be
the worst psychic...

1687
01:07:16,821 --> 01:07:17,788
in the history of time.

1688
01:07:17,855 --> 01:07:19,379
How could you not know
any of this?

1689
01:07:19,457 --> 01:07:21,982
Why didn't you just,
like, tell me?

1690
01:07:22,059 --> 01:07:24,994
Okay, remember when we met,

1691
01:07:25,062 --> 01:07:26,893
and-and-and
we started, you know...

1692
01:07:26,964 --> 01:07:28,522
going out to lunch and dinner...

1693
01:07:28,599 --> 01:07:33,662
and talking on the phone
all day and all night.

1694
01:07:33,738 --> 01:07:34,898
I thought we were dating.

1695
01:07:36,073 --> 01:07:37,370
And... And then...

1696
01:07:37,441 --> 01:07:40,535
And then, after a week,
we went to a movie.

1697
01:07:40,611 --> 01:07:44,445
I was just about to kiss you,
and you turned to me...

1698
01:07:44,515 --> 01:07:49,714
and you said, "I love having
a gay friend to talk to.

1699
01:07:49,787 --> 01:07:51,049
"I could never be
this comfortable...

1700
01:07:51,122 --> 01:07:52,248
"with a straight man."

1701
01:07:56,627 --> 01:07:58,788
What was...
What was I supposed to do?

1702
01:07:58,863 --> 01:08:00,854
You waited a week
to make your move!

1703
01:08:00,931 --> 01:08:02,455
Of course,
I thought you were gay.

1704
01:08:02,533 --> 01:08:03,500
I was taking it slow.

1705
01:08:03,567 --> 01:08:06,127
Five years, one kiss?
That's not slow.

1706
01:08:06,203 --> 01:08:07,261
That's family.

1707
01:08:07,338 --> 01:08:08,703
I'm sorry.
I missed my window.

1708
01:08:08,773 --> 01:08:11,469
I was... I was waiting for it
to come back around again.

1709
01:08:12,209 --> 01:08:13,801
God, Dan, you've, like...

1710
01:08:15,546 --> 01:08:16,706
betrayed me.

1711
01:08:16,781 --> 01:08:18,715
- Betrayed you?
- Yeah.

1712
01:08:18,783 --> 01:08:20,546
Ashley, I love you.

1713
01:08:20,618 --> 01:08:22,677
You think it was easy for me
listening to you...

1714
01:08:22,753 --> 01:08:24,653
talk about other guys, huh?

1715
01:08:24,722 --> 01:08:27,850
Watching mind-numbingly
boring romantic movies...

1716
01:08:27,925 --> 01:08:29,153
and pretending to cry?

1717
01:08:29,226 --> 01:08:31,888
Going shopping with you and
giving you advice on clothes?

1718
01:08:31,962 --> 01:08:34,157
Do you know how much
of the last five years...

1719
01:08:34,231 --> 01:08:36,131
I have spent
learning about clothes?

1720
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:40,432
This shirt cost me $175,
and I hate it!

1721
01:08:40,504 --> 01:08:41,493
I hate it!

1722
01:08:41,572 --> 01:08:42,766
I love that shirt.

1723
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:44,330
You know, before
this whole stupid thing...

1724
01:08:44,408 --> 01:08:46,774
I probably spent
$100 a year on clothes.

1725
01:08:46,844 --> 01:08:49,039
Now? Now, I spend that much
every three weeks...

1726
01:08:49,113 --> 01:08:51,547
on this haircut,
which I also hate!

1727
01:08:54,852 --> 01:08:56,149
God.

1728
01:08:56,220 --> 01:08:58,484
We took bubble baths together.

1729
01:08:58,556 --> 01:08:59,523
Yeah.

1730
01:08:59,590 --> 01:09:01,455
Now can you see
how hard it was for me?

1731
01:09:04,295 --> 01:09:08,322
I just wanted to cry
on my gay friend.

1732
01:09:14,138 --> 01:09:15,162
Yup.

1733
01:09:27,017 --> 01:09:28,211
I'll let myself out.

1734
01:09:32,590 --> 01:09:33,648
Okay.

1735
01:09:46,904 --> 01:09:48,701
All right, I'm ready.

1736
01:09:50,508 --> 01:09:52,135
You don't have a cat.

1737
01:09:52,209 --> 01:09:54,473
I rescued a stray,
so you'd talk to me.

1738
01:09:57,648 --> 01:09:58,672
Come in.

1739
01:10:02,786 --> 01:10:04,515
So, have you thought
about a name for him yet?

1740
01:10:04,588 --> 01:10:05,782
No. After we're done here...

1741
01:10:05,856 --> 01:10:07,517
I'm taking him
back to the pound.

1742
01:10:08,993 --> 01:10:10,255
I'm kidding.

1743
01:10:10,327 --> 01:10:13,455
It's a joke,
so you start laughing now...

1744
01:10:13,531 --> 01:10:16,967
breaks the tension,
and then we start talking again.

1745
01:10:17,034 --> 01:10:18,467
Pet's a big responsibility.

1746
01:10:18,536 --> 01:10:19,833
Did you ever think
about maybe just running...

1747
01:10:19,904 --> 01:10:20,871
into me on the street?

1748
01:10:20,938 --> 01:10:22,769
Listen, I didn't know
that Ashley was gonna use...

1749
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:24,740
the information I gave her
to start dating you.

1750
01:10:24,808 --> 01:10:26,503
I mean, I really thought
that she was just...

1751
01:10:26,577 --> 01:10:28,340
gonna tell you that Kate
wanted you to move on.

1752
01:10:32,149 --> 01:10:34,379
We... Do you
really have to do that?

1753
01:10:34,451 --> 01:10:35,713
Yeah, he needs his shots.

1754
01:10:36,487 --> 01:10:39,786
Yeah.
I think he's already had them.

1755
01:10:40,658 --> 01:10:42,285
He's my neighbor's cat.

1756
01:10:42,927 --> 01:10:45,088
Your neighbor let you borrow
her cat to bring to the vet?

1757
01:10:46,697 --> 01:10:47,721
You stole a cat?

1758
01:10:47,798 --> 01:10:49,265
I'm gonna bring him back.

1759
01:10:49,333 --> 01:10:51,233
He was on a fire escape.
It's like a walk.

1760
01:10:51,302 --> 01:10:52,564
Would you quit doin'
stupid stuff...

1761
01:10:52,636 --> 01:10:54,035
because you think you know
you're right?

1762
01:10:54,104 --> 01:10:55,799
Whoa. You should hear yourself.

1763
01:10:55,873 --> 01:10:56,965
You sound like Mom and Dad.

1764
01:10:57,041 --> 01:10:58,668
And your friends
and your bosses...

1765
01:10:58,742 --> 01:11:00,903
and your teachers and strangers
that you meet on the street.

1766
01:11:00,978 --> 01:11:03,310
They all tell you this
because it's true.

1767
01:11:03,380 --> 01:11:04,938
I'm sorry you feel that way.

1768
01:11:05,015 --> 01:11:06,949
See if you can get the cat home
without killing it.

1769
01:11:07,017 --> 01:11:08,245
I think I can handle it.

1770
01:11:15,593 --> 01:11:16,617
He's fine.

1771
01:11:26,904 --> 01:11:27,928
Hi.

1772
01:11:29,807 --> 01:11:31,240
I read this.

1773
01:11:31,308 --> 01:11:33,208
Henry, I really wanna talk
to you about all this.

1774
01:11:33,277 --> 01:11:34,244
- It's just...
- How did you know...

1775
01:11:34,311 --> 01:11:37,075
about the cake
or Hawaii or the chair?

1776
01:11:37,147 --> 01:11:38,114
None of that's in here...

1777
01:11:38,182 --> 01:11:39,479
and no one else
knows about that.

1778
01:11:40,584 --> 01:11:44,350
All right, um,
your sister gave me the diary...

1779
01:11:44,421 --> 01:11:45,888
and she asked me to pretend...

1780
01:11:45,956 --> 01:11:48,652
that Kate had talked to me,
which is not her fault...

1781
01:11:48,726 --> 01:11:50,717
because I shouldn't have done it
in the first place, okay?

1782
01:11:52,730 --> 01:11:55,631
But I did, because
I thought, I don't know...

1783
01:11:55,699 --> 01:11:58,327
I thought maybe you needed it,
you know, to help you move on.

1784
01:12:00,771 --> 01:12:03,069
But I must have crossed
over some sort of line...

1785
01:12:03,140 --> 01:12:06,906
or something, because
then, suddenly, she appeared.

1786
01:12:06,977 --> 01:12:08,171
- Kate.
- Yeah.

1787
01:12:08,245 --> 01:12:12,682
And sh... And she tried
to scare me away from you.

1788
01:12:13,484 --> 01:12:18,649
But I just... I really
wanted to be with you...

1789
01:12:18,722 --> 01:12:20,656
so I didn't let it stop me.

1790
01:12:20,724 --> 01:12:23,284
You pretended that
she wanted us to be together...

1791
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:24,850
because you thought that
that would make me...

1792
01:12:24,928 --> 01:12:26,020
fall in love with you.

1793
01:12:28,932 --> 01:12:30,160
Yeah, I guess I did.

1794
01:12:30,968 --> 01:12:32,333
I, um...

1795
01:12:32,403 --> 01:12:37,033
I hoped that you would love me
for other reasons, too.

1796
01:12:40,044 --> 01:12:42,205
- Is she here now?
- No, I haven't...

1797
01:12:42,279 --> 01:12:45,680
I haven't actually seen her,
um, since you broke up with me.

1798
01:12:46,884 --> 01:12:49,614
Guess it was her job
to get rid of me...

1799
01:12:49,687 --> 01:12:51,746
and, well, she did that.

1800
01:12:53,323 --> 01:12:55,382
So, she just sort of disappears?

1801
01:12:55,459 --> 01:12:56,858
I don't know.

1802
01:13:01,165 --> 01:13:02,189
Thank you.

01:14:09,032 --> 01:14:10,897
Cats are really good
with tools...

1825
01:14:10,968 --> 01:14:13,664
- # When all you gotta keep is strong #

1826
01:14:13,737 --> 01:14:15,637

- Dogs, actually.

- That's a funny trick.
- # When all you gotta keep #

1829
01:14:21,044 --> 01:14:22,705
- Is there something wrong with cats?

1850
01:15:14,765 --> 01:15:17,563
- Okay, Hi. Hello.
- Hello.

1851
01:15:17,634 --> 01:15:19,397
- Long time.
- Yeah, could've gone longer.

1852
01:15:19,469 --> 01:15:20,959
Yeah, listen, I've...

1853
01:15:21,038 --> 01:15:22,733
I've been thinking
about what I did, and...

1854
01:15:22,806 --> 01:15:23,966
Can we stop walking?

1855
01:15:24,041 --> 01:15:26,009
I'm trying to...
trying to be sincere...

1856
01:15:26,076 --> 01:15:27,703
and the panting
is really killing my delivery.

1857
01:15:27,778 --> 01:15:28,938
Sorry.

1858
01:15:29,980 --> 01:15:32,107
- I screwed up.
- Yeah, you did.

1859
01:15:32,182 --> 01:15:33,979
Yeah, I did.
Definitely screwed up.

1860
01:15:34,051 --> 01:15:35,416
But look at it this way.

1861
01:15:35,485 --> 01:15:37,612
I pretended I was gay
for five years.

1862
01:15:37,688 --> 01:15:40,054
Has any other man ever done
anything like that for you, huh?

1863
01:15:40,123 --> 01:15:41,147
I mean,
I could see a guy pretending...

1864
01:15:41,225 --> 01:15:43,557
for two, three...

1865
01:15:43,627 --> 01:15:44,651
- three, three years tops...
- Okay.

1866
01:15:44,728 --> 01:15:46,559
- but five, come on, that's...
- Okay.

1867
01:15:49,166 --> 01:15:52,226
All right, listen, Ashley,
you know me.

1868
01:15:52,302 --> 01:15:54,770
You know me better
than anyone else does.

1869
01:15:55,873 --> 01:15:57,602
And I know you.

1870
01:15:57,674 --> 01:15:59,574
Even though
I did a stupid, stupid...

1871
01:15:59,643 --> 01:16:00,610
Really stupid.

1872
01:16:00,677 --> 01:16:04,636
Beyond crazy, stupid thing
by lying to you...

1873
01:16:06,717 --> 01:16:09,117
we have been best friends
for five years.

1874
01:16:11,088 --> 01:16:12,783
Yes, that is true.

1875
01:16:14,691 --> 01:16:15,658
Look, I don't...

1876
01:16:15,726 --> 01:16:18,286
I don't know
any more fancy way to say this.

1877
01:16:20,063 --> 01:16:23,089
I'm a good guy. I love you.

1878
01:16:23,166 --> 01:16:25,634
And I... I just...

1879
01:16:25,702 --> 01:16:28,865
I just really wish
you'd give me a chance, so...

1880
01:16:32,910 --> 01:16:35,037
Do I attract
screwed-up guys, or what?

1881
01:16:52,529 --> 01:16:53,553
Hiya.

1882
01:16:55,465 --> 01:16:56,864
- You.
- Yeah.

1883
01:16:57,701 --> 01:16:59,362
Well, he doesn't look so good,
does he?

1884
01:17:00,203 --> 01:17:01,227
No, he doesn't.

1885
01:17:02,239 --> 01:17:04,036
Finish your mission?

1886
01:17:04,107 --> 01:17:05,074
Yeah. You?

1887
01:17:05,142 --> 01:17:07,940
No, or I wouldn't still be here.

1888
01:17:08,011 --> 01:17:09,501
- Really?
- Mm.

1889
01:17:09,579 --> 01:17:11,979
So you do move on
once you finish...

1890
01:17:12,049 --> 01:17:13,914
- what you're supposed to do?
- Oh, shoot.

1891
01:17:13,984 --> 01:17:16,145
Did you listen
to anything she said?

1892
01:17:17,254 --> 01:17:20,018
- No.
- So I guess you're not done yet.

1893
01:17:20,557 --> 01:17:22,081
Guess not.

1894
01:17:22,159 --> 01:17:24,957
Look, what do you think
you're supposed to do?

1895
01:17:26,029 --> 01:17:27,018
I don't know.

1896
01:17:27,097 --> 01:17:30,066
Well, what do you want more
than anything else right now?

1897
01:17:36,974 --> 01:17:37,941
For Henry to be happy.

1898
01:17:38,008 --> 01:17:38,975
Okay.

1899
01:17:39,042 --> 01:17:40,703
What do you think
would make Henry happy?

1900
01:17:46,316 --> 01:17:47,442
I don't know.

1901
01:17:47,517 --> 01:17:48,984
Think you do.

1902
01:17:49,052 --> 01:17:51,384
Damn it! Anything but that.

1903
01:17:53,924 --> 01:17:55,357
Wait, where are you going?

1904
01:17:55,425 --> 01:17:56,949
I'm done.

1905
01:17:57,027 --> 01:17:58,289
So your job was to...

1906
01:17:58,362 --> 01:18:00,296
Get you to do
the right thing, yeah.

1907
01:18:00,364 --> 01:18:02,195
Well, why didn't you just
tell me that in the first place?

1908
01:18:02,265 --> 01:18:04,733
Would you have believed me? Mmm.

1909
01:18:06,003 --> 01:18:07,595
See ya, up there.

1910
01:18:07,671 --> 01:18:09,696
Yeah? Well, if I see you,
I know I'm not in heaven.

1911
01:18:09,773 --> 01:18:11,263
That's the spirit.

1912
01:18:20,550 --> 01:18:22,245
The yellow dress?

1913
01:18:22,319 --> 01:18:24,844
Are you planning on wearing
that, or taking it to Goodwill?

1914
01:18:24,921 --> 01:18:26,684
I haven't talked to him
in months.

1915
01:18:26,757 --> 01:18:29,123
Wow. No, "Hello, Kate.

1916
01:18:29,192 --> 01:18:30,784
"How's the afterlife
treatin' you?"

1917
01:18:30,861 --> 01:18:32,260
You know, I think I lost weight.

1918
01:18:32,329 --> 01:18:34,320
I never looked this good
when I was alive.

1919
01:18:34,398 --> 01:18:35,422
What do you want, Kate?

1920
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:42,294
Um... all right,
this isn't easy for me, so...

1921
01:18:43,206 --> 01:18:45,197
You at a loss for words?

1922
01:18:45,275 --> 01:18:46,640
That's a first.

1923
01:18:47,978 --> 01:18:49,946
Have you talked to Henry,
you know, since...

1924
01:18:50,013 --> 01:18:51,173
Since you broke us up?

1925
01:18:51,248 --> 01:18:52,875
No, I haven't.

1926
01:18:52,949 --> 01:18:55,179
As a matter of fact,
I'm, uh, dating someone else.

1927
01:18:55,886 --> 01:18:56,944
No, you're not. You can't be.

1928
01:18:57,821 --> 01:18:59,550
Yes, I can,
and we're goin' to Vegas.

1929
01:18:59,623 --> 01:19:01,591
Well, stop! What about Henry?

1930
01:19:01,658 --> 01:19:02,750
What about him? You know what?

1931
01:19:02,826 --> 01:19:04,054
I am not interested
in whatever sick game...

1932
01:19:04,127 --> 01:19:05,287
you're playing, Kate.

1933
01:19:05,362 --> 01:19:06,727
No, listen to me.
I'm being very serious.

1934
01:19:06,797 --> 01:19:08,594
I want you two together.

1935
01:19:09,666 --> 01:19:10,860
No sale.

1936
01:19:12,869 --> 01:19:15,099
I can't believe I'm begging you
to date my husband.

1937
01:19:16,106 --> 01:19:18,973
Okay, don't you still love him?

1938
01:19:21,178 --> 01:19:22,839
Even if you weren't
screwing with me right now...

1939
01:19:22,913 --> 01:19:24,847
which it's
so clear that you are...

1940
01:19:24,915 --> 01:19:26,075
the answer would be no.

1941
01:19:27,350 --> 01:19:28,408
I moved on.

1942
01:19:30,353 --> 01:19:32,321
I mean, it killed me to do it,
but I did it.

1943
01:19:33,757 --> 01:19:34,781
So just, um...

1944
01:19:36,026 --> 01:19:38,153
Can you leave me alone now?
Please?

1945
01:19:53,477 --> 01:19:54,501
Get up!

1946
01:19:54,578 --> 01:19:55,909
Get up!

1947
01:19:55,979 --> 01:19:56,946
Henry!

1948
01:19:57,013 --> 01:19:58,605
Why can't you hear me?

1949
01:19:58,682 --> 01:20:00,081
Get up!

1950
01:20:02,786 --> 01:20:04,344
Everything okay over there?

1951
01:20:04,421 --> 01:20:05,649
Who cares about the bird?

1952
01:20:05,722 --> 01:20:07,656
Call Ashley!

1953
01:20:07,724 --> 01:20:09,248
Ashley. Call Ashley.

1954
01:20:10,660 --> 01:20:11,684
Ashley.

1955
01:20:13,897 --> 01:20:14,921
Did you just say...

1956
01:20:14,998 --> 01:20:17,125
- Ashley.
- Who taught you that?

1957
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:18,929
Call Ashley. Call Ashley.

1958
01:20:19,002 --> 01:20:20,196
You want me to call Ashley?

1959
01:20:20,270 --> 01:20:22,295
What do you...
I'm talking to my bird.

1960
01:20:22,372 --> 01:20:23,566
Get up. Get up.

1961
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:25,039
Kate?

1962
01:20:26,776 --> 01:20:27,800
Is that you?

1963
01:20:29,279 --> 01:20:32,146
Are you talking to me
through my bird?

1964
01:20:32,215 --> 01:20:33,307
Yes.

1965
01:20:34,351 --> 01:20:35,318
Why do you want me to...

1966
01:20:35,385 --> 01:20:36,443
Call Ashley.

1967
01:20:48,331 --> 01:20:49,696
I got a machine.

1968
01:20:49,766 --> 01:20:51,825
- Airport.
- What?

1969
01:20:51,902 --> 01:20:52,926
Airport.

1970
01:20:55,872 --> 01:20:56,839
Take the bird.

1971
01:20:56,907 --> 01:20:57,965
Oh, yeah.

1972
01:21:04,247 --> 01:21:06,545
# Think of all the luck
you got #

1973
01:21:07,617 --> 01:21:10,916
- Taxi! Taxi!
- # You know that it's not for naught #

1974
01:21:10,987 --> 01:21:12,955
Oh, hey, nice. Thanks.

1975
01:21:13,023 --> 01:21:14,354
Welcome.

1976
01:21:14,424 --> 01:21:16,619
- # It's not like that anymore #
- Where to?

1977
01:21:16,693 --> 01:21:18,058
Airport. Airport.

1978
01:21:19,663 --> 01:21:20,789
What? You heard the bird.
The airport.

1979
01:21:21,731 --> 01:21:23,323
Why are we going to the airport?
Where is she goin'?

1980
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:24,560
Las Vegas.

1981
01:21:24,634 --> 01:21:26,158
And you want me to stop her?
I thought you hated her.

1982
01:21:26,236 --> 01:21:27,362
What gave you that idea?

1983
01:21:27,437 --> 01:21:29,166
How do you even...
How do you know this?

1984
01:21:33,643 --> 01:21:34,701
What a day, right?

1985
01:21:36,146 --> 01:21:37,443
Got your bird with you, huh?

1986
01:21:37,514 --> 01:21:39,243
It's actually my, uh, fiancée.

1987
01:21:39,316 --> 01:21:41,716
- # What is this downside #
- Ah.

1988
01:21:41,785 --> 01:21:44,777
- I think.
- # That you speak of? #

1989
01:21:45,689 --> 01:21:47,714
# What is this feeling #

1990
01:21:47,791 --> 01:21:51,955
# You're so #

1991
01:21:52,028 --> 01:21:53,723
# Sure of? #

1992
01:21:57,801 --> 01:22:00,395
# What is this downside #

1993
01:22:00,470 --> 01:22:01,528
Ashley!

1994
01:22:01,605 --> 01:22:03,300
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Back of the line, sir.

1995
01:22:03,373 --> 01:22:04,601
I just need to talk
to that woman for a second.

1996
01:22:04,674 --> 01:22:06,403
The only way you get
through here is with a ticket.

1997
01:22:07,043 --> 01:22:08,408
Could you maybe get her then?

1998
01:22:09,346 --> 01:22:10,438
It's an emergency.

1999
01:22:10,513 --> 01:22:11,810
Oh, it's an emergency?

2000
01:22:11,881 --> 01:22:13,314
Well, by all means,
come on in, man.

2001
01:22:13,383 --> 01:22:14,543
You know,
people who have emergencies...

2002
01:22:14,618 --> 01:22:16,609
don't even have to go
through the metal detectors.

2003
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:19,112
All right, there's
really no need for sarcasm.

2004
01:22:19,189 --> 01:22:20,486
Back of the line.

2005
01:22:21,024 --> 01:22:22,855
Hi. I need the cheapest
ticket you have.

2006
01:22:22,926 --> 01:22:23,915
Where do you wanna go, sir?

2007
01:22:23,994 --> 01:22:25,154
It doesn't matter.

2008
01:22:25,228 --> 01:22:27,423
Well, that's not
at all suspicious.

2009
01:22:28,398 --> 01:22:29,422
Hurry up, lard ass.

2010
01:22:30,500 --> 01:22:31,467
Excuse me?

2011
01:22:31,534 --> 01:22:33,229
Uh... no, that's, uh...

2012
01:22:33,303 --> 01:22:34,736
That's... That's my bird.

2013
01:22:34,804 --> 01:22:36,271
He says that to everybody.

2014
01:22:37,641 --> 01:22:39,131
Move those fat fingers, Helen.

2015
01:22:40,243 --> 01:22:41,676
All right, you know what?
That's enough.

2016
01:22:41,745 --> 01:22:42,769
Sorry.

2017
01:22:44,414 --> 01:22:48,248
One ticket to Miami, $1,350.

2018
01:22:48,318 --> 01:22:50,980
- That's the cheapest ticket...
- Don't be cheap. Buy it!

2019
01:22:51,054 --> 01:22:52,113
All right, you know,
that's fine. That's fine.

2020
01:22:52,114 --> 01:22:52,248
Buy it!

2021
01:22:53,990 --> 01:22:55,321
You know, I never really
thought about it...

2022
01:22:55,392 --> 01:22:57,758
but, uh, a psychic in Vegas?

2023
01:22:57,827 --> 01:22:59,522
We could really clean up,
you know?

2024
01:22:59,596 --> 01:23:01,223
Yeah.
Too bad I don't do that anymore.

2025
01:23:01,298 --> 01:23:02,265
All right.

2026
01:23:02,332 --> 01:23:03,299
Over there.

2027
01:23:03,366 --> 01:23:04,856
What?

2028
01:23:04,934 --> 01:23:06,231
What's the matter?

2029
01:23:06,303 --> 01:23:07,270
You don't wanna know.

2030
01:23:07,337 --> 01:23:08,599
Ashley.

2031
01:23:10,140 --> 01:23:11,164
What are you doing here?

2032
01:23:11,241 --> 01:23:13,402
I don't know.
The bird told me to come here.

2033
01:23:13,476 --> 01:23:14,443
Did you do this?

2034
01:23:14,511 --> 01:23:15,603
Who are you talking to?

2035
01:23:15,679 --> 01:23:17,943
Oh, let me...
Let me guess, uh, the ghost?

2036
01:23:18,014 --> 01:23:18,981
Why are you here?

2037
01:23:19,049 --> 01:23:21,074
Why is your arm around her?
You're gay.

2038
01:23:21,151 --> 01:23:22,743
No, I'm not...
I'm not gay. No, no.

2039
01:23:22,819 --> 01:23:24,150
No, I've never been gay.

2040
01:23:24,220 --> 01:23:25,710
Methinks
he doth protest too much.

2041
01:23:30,293 --> 01:23:31,317
Do you really want this?

2042
01:23:33,997 --> 01:23:35,464
Henry does.

2043
01:23:35,532 --> 01:23:36,499
Where is she?

2044
01:23:36,566 --> 01:23:37,726
She's right next to you.

2045
01:23:42,539 --> 01:23:44,200
You want Ashley and me
to be together?

2046
01:23:46,409 --> 01:23:47,501
I do.

2047
01:23:47,577 --> 01:23:50,341
I'm sorry I put you
through all of this.

2048
01:23:50,413 --> 01:23:52,779
She says she does,
and she's sorry...

2049
01:23:52,849 --> 01:23:54,544
for being such a royal bitch.

2050
01:23:55,352 --> 01:23:57,445
I mean, I'm... I'm paraphrasing.

2051
01:23:59,756 --> 01:24:00,780
Thank you, Kate.

2052
01:24:01,991 --> 01:24:03,185
You're welcome, Henry.

2053
01:24:09,366 --> 01:24:11,197
When we get to heaven,
all bets are off.

2054
01:24:13,436 --> 01:24:14,767
She says you're welcome.

2055
01:24:15,405 --> 01:24:17,737
So, Kate
wants us to be together.

2056
01:24:18,875 --> 01:24:20,342
I want us to be together.

2057
01:24:23,179 --> 01:24:24,203
What do you want?

2058
01:24:26,616 --> 01:24:28,709
Well, I wouldn't
wanna piss her off again.

2059
01:24:29,552 --> 01:24:32,214
# And love #

2060
01:24:32,288 --> 01:24:35,780
# Such a silly game
we play #

2061
01:24:35,859 --> 01:24:38,851
# Oh, like a summer's day
in May #

2062
01:24:38,928 --> 01:24:41,021
# What is love? What is love? #

2063
01:24:41,097 --> 01:24:44,589
- Hello?
- # I just want you to be loved #

2064
01:24:44,667 --> 01:24:46,157
# Oh-oh-oh #

2065
01:24:46,236 --> 01:24:48,431
You know what? That probably
wasn't gonna work out anyway.

2066
01:24:48,505 --> 01:24:49,665
- I'm Bill, by the...
- I'm not gay!

2067
01:24:49,739 --> 01:24:50,706
- Okay.
- Okay.

2068
01:24:50,774 --> 01:24:51,741
- All right.
- Very good.

2069
01:24:51,808 --> 01:24:53,571
Me, neither. Not gay at all.

2070
01:24:53,643 --> 01:24:55,702
Um, maybe, though,
when we get to Vegas...

2071
01:24:55,779 --> 01:24:56,746
we can grab some dinner...

2072
01:24:56,813 --> 01:24:59,611
and talk about how,
you know, not gay we are.

2073
01:25:00,483 --> 01:25:01,973
# Ah, ah, ah #

2074
01:25:02,051 --> 01:25:04,417
# Love #

2075
01:25:04,487 --> 01:25:07,650
# Who could tell me
I am wrong? #

2076
01:25:09,058 --> 01:25:11,049
# I just think
that I am strong #

2077
01:25:11,127 --> 01:25:13,391
# What is love? What is love? #

2078
01:25:13,463 --> 01:25:16,728
# I just want you to be loved #

2079
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:18,233
# Oh-oh oh-oh #

2080
01:25:18,301 --> 01:25:19,393
# Oh-oh #

2081
01:25:24,641 --> 01:25:27,667
I am so glad I met you.
You're hilarious.

2082
01:25:27,744 --> 01:25:29,541
I was just going
for ironically amusing.

2083
01:25:29,612 --> 01:25:30,943
Are you sure you haven't
been drinking already?

2084
01:25:31,014 --> 01:25:32,641
Oh, wait
till after the ceremony.

2085
01:25:32,715 --> 01:25:33,682
If you like me now...

2086
01:25:33,750 --> 01:25:35,581
you are gonna love me
when I'm drunk.

2087
01:25:47,163 --> 01:25:49,188
Wow. That was, um...

2088
01:25:50,066 --> 01:25:51,966
- really quick.
- Well, I'm not gay.

2089
01:25:52,035 --> 01:25:53,662
I'm not gay.

2090
01:25:53,736 --> 01:25:54,703
I just need...
I just wanna get that...

2091
01:25:54,771 --> 01:25:56,534
out there right now, so there's
no misunderstanding later.

2092
01:25:56,606 --> 01:25:59,700
I'm not...
So that's why we, uh... Okay.

2093
01:26:00,844 --> 01:26:01,970
There she is.

2094
01:26:11,855 --> 01:26:12,879
Oh, God, hold on, Dad.

2095
01:26:13,456 --> 01:26:15,117
One second. One second.

2096
01:26:19,429 --> 01:26:20,453
Hi.

2097
01:26:23,266 --> 01:26:25,029
Look, I know
this was supposed to be you...

2098
01:26:26,236 --> 01:26:27,362
so thank you.

2099
01:26:29,806 --> 01:26:31,433
Just make him happy, okay?

2100
01:26:33,576 --> 01:26:34,668
Or else, you know.

2101
01:26:37,046 --> 01:26:39,776
Wait, can you come back
and haunt me for that, or...

2102
01:26:39,849 --> 01:26:40,873
I... I don't know.

2103
01:26:40,950 --> 01:26:42,815
I kind of missed
the orientation speech.

2104
01:26:48,191 --> 01:26:49,590
Don't worry.

2105
01:26:50,860 --> 01:26:52,555
Kate, I will make him happy.

2106
01:26:57,467 --> 01:26:58,900
I love Gardenias.

2107
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:11,504
Sorry.

2108
01:27:34,804 --> 01:27:37,102
We are gathered here
in the presence of God...

2109
01:27:37,173 --> 01:27:39,573
to witness the exchanging
of vows that will bind...

2110
01:27:39,642 --> 01:27:41,610
- # I can see clearly now #
- this couple together...

2111
01:27:41,678 --> 01:27:42,487
# The rain is gone #

2112
01:27:42,488 --> 01:27:44,306
in the covenant and
relationship of marriage.

2113
01:27:44,380 --> 01:27:47,076
When the ceremony has ended,
they will leave this place...

2114
01:27:47,150 --> 01:27:49,618
- # I can see all obstacles #
- as husband and wife...

2115
01:27:49,686 --> 01:27:51,711
- # In my way #
- for the very first time.

2116
01:27:54,591 --> 01:28:00,029
# Gone are the dark clouds
that had me blind #

2117
01:28:00,096 --> 01:28:02,087
# It's gonna be a bright #

2118
01:28:03,099 --> 01:28:05,932
# Bright, sunshiny day #

2119
01:28:07,503 --> 01:28:09,403
# Yeah #

2120
01:28:09,472 --> 01:28:11,201
# Look all around #

2121
01:28:11,274 --> 01:28:15,370
# There's nothin'
but blue skies #

2122
01:28:16,813 --> 01:28:18,337
# Look straight ahead #

2123
01:28:18,414 --> 01:28:23,909
# There's nothin'
but blue skies #

2124
01:28:23,987 --> 01:28:26,182
# I can see clearly now #

2125
01:28:26,255 --> 01:28:28,553
# The rain is gone #

2126
01:28:31,494 --> 01:28:35,863
# I can see all obstacles
in my way #

2127
01:28:38,935 --> 01:28:44,168
# Gone are the dark clouds
that had me blind #

2128
01:28:44,240 --> 01:28:46,265
- # It's gonna be a bright #
- Hello, Kate.

2129
01:28:46,342 --> 01:28:47,673
- # Bright #
- # Bright #

2130
01:28:47,744 --> 01:28:49,473
Not you again! Come on!

2131
01:28:49,545 --> 01:28:51,604
Relax! I'm just here
to congratulate you.

2132
01:28:51,681 --> 01:28:52,807
Really?

2133
01:28:52,882 --> 01:28:54,213
I did the right thing?

2134
01:28:54,283 --> 01:28:55,875
You certainly did.

2135
01:28:55,952 --> 01:28:57,613
Now just give me back
the orb of true light...

2136
01:28:57,687 --> 01:28:59,120
that you collected
from your loved ones...

2137
01:28:59,188 --> 01:29:00,712
and you can move on.

2138
01:29:01,357 --> 01:29:02,324
I'm sorry,
the orb of which what?

2139
01:29:02,392 --> 01:29:03,552
Oh, dear.

2140
01:29:03,626 --> 01:29:04,684
Are you screwing with me?

2141
01:29:04,761 --> 01:29:06,490
Are you allowed
to screw with me?

2142
01:29:06,562 --> 01:29:07,529
Hey, hey, no!

2143
01:29:07,597 --> 01:29:09,360
You are not disappearing
on another conversation!

2144
01:29:09,432 --> 01:29:11,332
You better hope I don't end up
in this room again!

2145
01:29:11,401 --> 01:29:12,925
I'm gonna kick your ass!

2146
01:29:13,002 --> 01:29:14,230
Get back here!

2147
01:29:15,371 --> 01:29:16,895
# Hey now now #

2148
01:29:16,973 --> 01:29:20,136
# They'll find you
when you're sleepin', now now #

2149
01:29:20,209 --> 01:29:23,474
# They'll reach in and grab
what you're dreamin', now now #

2150
01:29:23,546 --> 01:29:25,343
# Cut it up
and slip it back in #

2151
01:29:25,415 --> 01:29:28,350
# And I know, and I know,
and I know it #

2152
01:29:28,418 --> 01:29:29,783
# Hey now now #

2153
01:29:29,852 --> 01:29:33,049
# The smallest things
are crushin' me now #

2154
01:29:33,122 --> 01:29:36,285
# The crush, crush, crush
is so comforting now #

2155
01:29:36,359 --> 01:29:38,418
# Did the Earth just slam
in the sun? #

2156
01:29:38,494 --> 01:29:41,554
# And I know, and I know,
and I know it #

2157
01:29:41,631 --> 01:29:48,059
# Won't undo my past by walkin'
and talkin' backwards #

2158
01:29:48,137 --> 01:29:50,867
# Hey now now,
we're goin' down down #

2159
01:29:50,940 --> 01:29:52,601
# And we ride the bus there #

2160
01:29:52,675 --> 01:29:54,165
# Pay the bus fare #

2161
01:29:54,243 --> 01:29:55,938
# Or we find a new reason #

2162
01:29:56,012 --> 01:29:57,445
# A new way of livin' #

2163
01:29:57,513 --> 01:29:58,844
# And we shout it out #

2164
01:29:58,915 --> 01:30:01,076
# And try to dream again #

2165

# "like you are

2197
01:31:42,785 --> 01:31:44,685

# The more I behave badly,
I can bet #

2199
01:31:50,159 --> 01:31:56,189
# Hey, Lloyd,
I'm ready to be heartbroken #

2200
01:31:56,265 --> 01:31:58,859
# 'Cause I can't see further #

2201
01:31:58,935 --> 01:32:02,598
# Than my own nose
at this moment #

2202
01:32:10,379 --> 01:32:12,176
# Jealousy is more than a word #

2203
01:32:12,248 --> 01:32:14,682
# Now I understand #

2204
01:32:16,953 --> 01:32:18,818
# You can't stand a girl #

2205
01:32:18,888 --> 01:32:23,723
# While holdin' a boy's hand #

2206
01:32:23,793 --> 01:32:29,663
# Hey, Lloyd,
I'm ready to be heartbroken #
