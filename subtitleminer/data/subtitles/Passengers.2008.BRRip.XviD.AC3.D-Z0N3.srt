00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:18,164
Hello.. hello?

4
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:21,349
Oh, hi.

5
00:02:24,536 --> 00:02:26,448
Oh, I'm wide awake.
What's up?

6
00:02:28,517 --> 00:02:30,104
Sources are telling us that
this decision was made...

7
00:02:30,105 --> 00:02:32,968
in the last few minutes at the precaution
and there is no indication...

8
00:02:32,969 --> 00:02:35,995
that this airplane crash was
anything other than an accident.

9
00:02:35,996 --> 00:02:39,127
In any case, it is too soon to determine
whether the system malfunction...

10
00:02:39,128 --> 00:02:42,243
was involved or whether human error was--

11
00:02:51,265 --> 00:02:52,405
- Hello, my dear.
- Hi.

12
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:53,406
It's freezing.

13
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:54,407
Thank you for coming so quickly.

14
00:02:54,408 --> 00:02:56,798
Of course.
Thank you.

They came down on a beach, near Pinewood.
Just a handful were left, out of 109.

16
00:03:04,539 --> 00:03:05,930
You should handle the whole group.

17
00:03:08,362 --> 00:03:08,611
Really?

18
00:03:08,612 --> 00:03:10,662
No, you're gonna have to trust
my judgment on this one.

19
00:03:11,002 --> 00:03:13,471
It's time to shake you out of this
comfort zone you're in.

20
00:03:14,214 --> 00:03:15,277
I'm not in a comfort zone.

Two master's degrees, already?
Ph.D. that never ends?

22
00:03:18,793 --> 00:03:21,302
That sounds pretty cozy to me.

23
00:03:25,253 --> 00:03:29,026
Okay, that's the start, mostly,
it's nothing new.

24
00:03:29,027 --> 00:03:32,374
One will require little more work,
though. He's euphoric.

25
00:03:32,508 --> 00:03:35,644
He's feeling little
hmm... too good.

26
00:03:40,145 --> 00:03:40,690
Uh...

27
00:03:43,486 --> 00:03:45,112
Oh!  I'm sorry--

28
00:04:01,245 --> 00:04:03,174
Oh, excuse me, could you-- ?

00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:22,761
Mr. Clark?

00:04:23,881 --> 00:04:25,222
Come in!

32
00:04:27,652 --> 00:04:28,364
Mr. Clark.

00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,234
I'm Eric.

- Dr. Summers.
- Hi.

35
00:04:33,598 --> 00:04:34,712
May I?

36
00:04:35,293 --> 00:04:37,136
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

37
00:04:38,184 --> 00:04:39,198
How are you feeling?

38
00:04:40,642 --> 00:04:41,570
I feel great.

39
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,814
Mr. Clark, I'm a therapist.

40
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:47,478
I'm recommending that the passengers
meet with me in group sessions.

41
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:49,398
You are?
Well, no thanks.

42
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:53,051
Oh, okay. I understand.

43
00:04:53,052 --> 00:04:56,816
If you'd feel more comfortable,
outside of the group environment...

44
00:04:56,817 --> 00:04:57,973
we could meet one on one.

45
00:04:57,974 --> 00:04:59,147
You make house calls?

46
00:04:59,148 --> 00:05:04,039
Well, it's.. not.. protocol.. but.. hmm..
sometimes, under special circumstances.

47
00:05:07,925 --> 00:05:08,052
What does one have to do to become
a "special circumstance" around here?

48
00:05:08,087 --> 00:05:10,762
Survive a plane crash?

49
00:05:10,797 --> 00:05:12,237
Uhmm..

50
00:05:15,679 --> 00:05:17,293
You have a very lovely way about you.

51
00:05:18,602 --> 00:05:19,346
Hmm?

52
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:21,231
I mean you're very formal,
but--

53
00:05:22,064 --> 00:05:22,828
it's charming.

54
00:05:26,569 --> 00:05:28,307
Is this your correct
contact information?

55
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:29,888
Okay.

56
00:05:31,012 --> 00:05:32,209
So, umm..

57
00:05:33,926 --> 00:05:34,984
Friday at five?

00:05:35,905 --> 00:05:36,796

00:05:40,712 --> 00:05:41,243
Good.

60
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:44,693
Is there anyone here for you?

61
00:05:46,161 --> 00:05:49,470
- No.
- I can call someone if you.. want me to.

62
00:05:50,665 --> 00:05:51,809
It's okay.

63
00:05:52,965 --> 00:05:54,201

Yes?

Do you have a sister?

69
00:06:11,503 --> 00:06:12,645
Yes.

70
00:06:13,273 --> 00:06:14,762
You should call her.

71
00:06:15,068 --> 00:06:16,183
What?

72
00:06:16,383 --> 00:06:18,276
Better now than later.

73
00:06:18,841 --> 00:06:21,466
You could step out front of a bus
or something, and then what?

Oh, right, oh--

00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,445
It was sitting in the dryer
for a while.

80
00:06:57,645 --> 00:07:00,249
Oh, I'm sorry, I had an emergency
at work, and I had to run out.

81
00:07:01,107 --> 00:07:03,624
Um, I've noticed that sometimes
you're too busy to pick up...

82
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:06,711
your newspapers, so I can take them
and hold them for you.

83
00:07:07,013 --> 00:07:08,987
Oh, no, no, it's fine.

84
00:07:09,502 --> 00:07:10,302
It's no bother.

85
00:07:10,633 --> 00:07:14,615
Oh.. thank you.. but, you know what..
thank you, that's something...

not to let happen again.

you let me know.

I was at peace.

106
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:40,242
I always knew that I wouldn't live to
an old age so I just thought this is it.

107
00:08:42,683 --> 00:08:50,064
I looked around.. and just felt such
a pity for everyone.. all that fear.

when did you first realize
that something was wrong?

00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,418
Uh.. we were still up pretty high, and...

111
00:09:03,574 --> 00:09:06,374
plane was just cruising along,
and there was this sound...

112
00:09:07,187 --> 00:09:09,293
the lights went up and there was a flash--

113
00:09:09,444 --> 00:09:10,694
That's not what happened.

114
00:09:10,821 --> 00:09:13,433
There were no explosions
'till after we hit the ground.

115
00:09:13,567 --> 00:09:14,728
No warning, nothing.

116
00:09:14,855 --> 00:09:16,596
That's right.
It was when we were landing.

117
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:18,735
Don't tell me what I remember. Okay?

118
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:20,889
Shannon, Shannon...

119
00:09:21,747 --> 00:09:26,452
you said that you looked around
and you saw that fear...

120
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:31,537
but also that it was so sudden that..
you hit the ground without warning.

121
00:09:32,252 --> 00:09:33,282
So?

122
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,264
When exactly did you have that moment
to look around at the others?

123
00:09:38,772 --> 00:09:41,437
Does it matter?
Is this a test?

124
00:09:42,234 --> 00:09:45,051
No, of course, it's not a test.

00:09:51,961 --> 00:09:53,123
Janice?

126
00:09:54,214 --> 00:09:55,710
Do you remember any of this?

127
00:10:03,858 --> 00:10:05,031
Dean...

128
00:10:05,763 --> 00:10:08,542
there was something you said earlier
I really wanted to talk to you about...

129
00:10:08,738 --> 00:10:09,351
beca--

130
00:10:16,397 --> 00:10:18,322
Excuse me for a second.

131
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:34,023
I'm afraid that's not what happened.

132
00:10:35,327 --> 00:10:38,782
The pilot misjudged the approach
and lost control.

133
00:10:40,122 --> 00:10:42,039
Mistakes were made, unfortunately.

134
00:10:42,256 --> 00:10:45,137
This passenger remembers fire on board,
maybe, before impact.

135
00:10:45,235 --> 00:10:49,848
But, isn't it common for..
people who are going through this...

136
00:10:49,913 --> 00:10:58,533
to be disoriented.. to be unsure
of what he saw.. even delusional.

137
00:10:58,696 --> 00:11:04,358
Yes, but it's also possible to be
in a heightened state of awareness...

138
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,790
where every details and
sensations are remembered.

139
00:11:10,305 --> 00:11:13,752
Dr. Summers,
let's try to be careful.

140
00:11:14,197 --> 00:11:17,189
I'm not trying to challenge any findings
or put the airliner on the spot.

141
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:19,625
I'm only thinking of the patients.

142
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:23,966
Accurate reconstruction of events is
essential to healing process, that's all.

143
00:11:28,135 --> 00:11:29,272
Thank you.

144
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:41,784
- Good day, doctor.
- Good day.

Hi, you scared me.

148
00:12:04,338 --> 00:12:05,567
What are you doing here, doctor?

149
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:10,475
We have an appointment.
At.. umm.. here.

150
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:14,294
Oh, yeah, the house call.
I completely forgot.

151
00:12:15,008 --> 00:12:16,347
No, it's okay.

152
00:12:17,857 --> 00:12:18,654
Wanna a fig?

153
00:12:19,098 --> 00:12:20,466
No, you should probably wash those.

154
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:41,196
So, let's just clear the air, okay?
I'm not anyone's patient, all right?

155
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,449
Okay.

156
00:12:51,777 --> 00:12:53,167
Cream and sugar for you.

157
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:01,790
You are very attractive.

158
00:13:03,856 --> 00:13:04,946
Thank you.

159
00:13:08,186 --> 00:13:11,437
Eric, you feel fine now,
ecstatic, even, it's common.

160
00:13:12,204 --> 00:13:15,014
But.. when we go through
shocks to the system...

161
00:13:15,292 --> 00:13:17,283
there is often a repression
of negative feelings.

162
00:13:18,835 --> 00:13:21,879
Later on, these feelings will creep up
on you. There will be a balance due.

163
00:13:22,338 --> 00:13:23,441
Do you paint?

00:13:24,084 --> 00:13:25,265
No.

165
00:13:26,033 --> 00:13:27,391
I always wanted to paint.

166
00:13:28,277 --> 00:13:29,912
But I never dared.

167
00:13:31,786 --> 00:13:33,678
What kind of things would you paint?

168
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:36,071
(Chuckling)

169
00:13:36,461 --> 00:13:37,813
God you just can't help yourself,
can you, doctor?

170
00:13:39,314 --> 00:13:40,775
Okay.

171
00:13:41,968 --> 00:13:43,592
I did promise.

172
00:13:49,372 --> 00:13:50,769
What do you do for work?

173
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:56,047
I'm a VP at Hein Dragg,
it's a brokerage firm.

174
00:13:57,827 --> 00:13:59,485
But I'm not going back to that.

175
00:14:00,802 --> 00:14:04,828
I've spent most of my life,
living the wrong way.

176
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,394
See my control towel, over here?

177
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:14,776
Printer, fax, high-speed Internet,
computers, e-mail, telephone, cell phone...

178
00:14:15,362 --> 00:14:19,776
multimessengers, it's horse-shit.

179
00:14:21,085 --> 00:14:23,737
Design to keep people away
from each other.

180
00:14:24,707 --> 00:14:27,323
Did you feel that way before..
before the accident?

181
00:14:28,462 --> 00:14:31,014
No, I was too busy working my ass off,
afraid of the rain.

182
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:35,716
So, you're re-evaluating your priorities.

183
00:14:37,969 --> 00:14:38,652
Well put.

184
00:14:44,924 --> 00:14:48,479
Eric, it's really important that we mean
to revisit your experience.

185
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,275
Okay.

186
00:15:02,131 --> 00:15:04,405
What's the first thing that comes
to your mind about the accident?

187
00:15:10,798 --> 00:15:12,099
The wind in my face.

188
00:15:13,299 --> 00:15:16,177
Okay, what do you remember after that?

189
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:21,962
Walking the beach,
next to a rather large bonfire.

190
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:27,598
Can you remember anything else
between these two events?

191
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:34,067
One of the other passengers says that
he remembers bright light...

192
00:15:34,557 --> 00:15:36,032
or a loud noise, perhaps...

193
00:15:36,255 --> 00:15:38,898
but something during the mid-flight.

194
00:15:47,271 --> 00:15:49,382
It's okay to cry.

195
00:15:52,373 --> 00:15:53,760
I'm not gonna cry.

196
00:15:57,308 --> 00:15:58,685
Uhmm..

197
00:16:01,539 --> 00:16:02,590
What else?

198
00:16:04,465 --> 00:16:05,673
Are you sleeping?

199
00:16:06,652 --> 00:16:07,892
Of course.

200
00:16:09,327 --> 00:16:10,698
Any dreams?

201
00:16:11,274 --> 00:16:12,582
I don't remember.

202
00:16:13,881 --> 00:16:16,032
Stick around, I will awake you
when I'm having one.

203
00:16:18,954 --> 00:16:20,232
No thanks.

204
00:16:21,007 --> 00:16:22,316
Why not?

205
00:16:22,586 --> 00:16:24,014
I don't know.

206
00:16:24,523 --> 00:16:26,721
It's frowned upon in
my professional community.

207
00:16:26,906 --> 00:16:28,262
Isn't that silly?

208
00:16:28,419 --> 00:16:30,013
It is silly.

209
00:16:31,192 --> 00:16:32,865
Directions to the group meeting.

210
00:16:33,045 --> 00:16:34,812
You should come by, Eric,
you won't regret it.

211
00:16:34,908 --> 00:16:36,651
You're like a dog with a bone.

212
00:16:39,876 --> 00:16:41,224
Thanks for the coffee.

213
00:16:44,775 --> 00:16:45,937
Hey, Claire.

214
00:16:48,998 --> 00:16:50,724
Drop by any time.

215
00:17:25,592 --> 00:17:27,834
Did you mention me to Eric Clark
before I came along?

216
00:17:28,012 --> 00:17:29,258
- No.
- No?

217
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,063
I've never met him.

218
00:17:31,597 --> 00:17:33,337
He knows personal things about me.

219
00:17:33,554 --> 00:17:34,725
Like what?

220
00:17:35,107 --> 00:17:38,114
Not any big things, how to
take my coffee, that I have a sister.

221
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,204
How does he explain it?

222
00:17:40,578 --> 00:17:42,630
No, he hasn't tried,
and I haven't asked.

223
00:17:42,941 --> 00:17:43,891
How is your sister?

224
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,143
Uhmm..

225
00:17:45,192 --> 00:17:46,010
Emma?

226
00:17:46,062 --> 00:17:47,012
Emma, right.

227
00:17:47,072 --> 00:17:48,441
- She's good.
- She's good?

228
00:17:48,461 --> 00:17:51,230
She's good. Yeah...

229
00:17:51,272 --> 00:17:54,640
I've been doing some research
on some PTSD patients...

230
00:17:54,685 --> 00:17:59,072
that may have developed
an extrasensory perception.

231
00:17:59,109 --> 00:18:00,376
Really?

232
00:18:00,461 --> 00:18:02,890
It's a.. theory.

233
00:18:02,891 --> 00:18:05,205
Most of combat veterans.

234
00:18:06,674 --> 00:18:10,659
So, he's a..
so, he's reading your mind.

235
00:18:12,415 --> 00:18:13,360
Hmm?

236
00:18:15,348 --> 00:18:16,443
- Yes?
- All right, all right.

237
00:18:16,725 --> 00:18:18,098
(Chuckling)

238
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,201
Claire.

239
00:18:26,715 --> 00:18:29,027
Did they even find any more information
about what happened up there?

240
00:18:29,781 --> 00:18:30,932
Why do you ask?

241
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:34,191
Well, their initial assessments
are all over the place.

242
00:18:34,293 --> 00:18:36,852
This one passenger, Dean Haschle,
he seems to remember...

243
00:18:36,905 --> 00:18:40,476
an explosion on board.
None of the others agree.

244
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:41,857
They all have a different story.

245
00:18:41,898 --> 00:18:44,462
There's bound to be some discrepancies.

246
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:47,644
An explosion would cause
an accident, not a pilot error.

247
00:18:48,577 --> 00:18:51,485
I spoke to a man at the airline, and
he seemed pretty annoyed by this theory.

248
00:18:52,092 --> 00:18:54,905
- And..
- Stop, stop, stop. You're not a detective.

249
00:18:55,892 --> 00:18:58,569
Stick to your patients,
and their progresses. That's it.

250
00:18:59,496 --> 00:19:04,251
Okay, fair enough, but the huge part of
their progress will be knowing the truth.

251
00:19:04,284 --> 00:19:06,896
'The truth heals,' who said that?

252
00:19:06,925 --> 00:19:08,809
I don't know, some dead white guy.

253
00:19:08,821 --> 00:19:10,592
No, you.

254
00:19:12,681 --> 00:19:14,059
Well, how are you finding the work?

255
00:19:14,304 --> 00:19:17,722
Well, I should have been doing
this long time ago, well, you knew that.

256
00:19:19,228 --> 00:19:20,687
Better late than never, I guess.

257
00:19:21,353 --> 00:19:24,240
This is good. This is good.

258
00:19:38,949 --> 00:19:41,345
Does anyone have a contact
with Dean since our last session?

259
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,293
Not surprised that he isn't back.

260
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,723
I don't think this little
get-togethers are any use...

261
00:19:48,525 --> 00:19:50,138
spilling your guts to strangers.

262
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:56,864
Shannon.. have you tried talking
to your friends or relatives...

263
00:19:56,889 --> 00:19:58,533
about what you're feeling?

264
00:19:58,585 --> 00:20:00,602
Loved ones could be great source of comfort.

265
00:20:00,648 --> 00:20:01,834
Nope.

266
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:03,403
Are you all right?

267
00:20:03,876 --> 00:20:05,203
I'm good.

268
00:20:10,605 --> 00:20:11,918
I'm little tired.

269
00:20:12,248 --> 00:20:13,935
Are you sleeping well?

270
00:20:16,488 --> 00:20:17,641
Not really.

271
00:20:19,699 --> 00:20:22,340
We can talk to a physician
and get you something to help you sleep.

272
00:20:24,217 --> 00:20:25,232
No.

273
00:20:30,383 --> 00:20:31,331
Good night, Shannon.

274
00:20:34,044 --> 00:20:37,554
Do you always offer medication
in front of other patients?

275
00:20:38,544 --> 00:20:39,571
Oh, Shannon, I'm sorr--

276
00:20:39,868 --> 00:20:42,192
What qualifies you,
really, to talk to us?

277
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:45,195
You have no idea
what any of us are going through.

278
00:21:08,215 --> 00:21:08,928
Doctor!

279
00:21:09,483 --> 00:21:10,088
Norman?

280
00:21:10,273 --> 00:21:11,147
In your car, please.

281
00:21:11,283 --> 00:21:12,418
- What's the matter?
- Let's go. C'mon.

282
00:21:13,007 --> 00:21:13,816
Norman.

283
00:21:15,731 --> 00:21:18,513
Please! Just bear with me.

284
00:21:21,978 --> 00:21:23,724
Okay. Okay.

285
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,514
Just pull out here, and make this U-turn.

286
00:21:30,842 --> 00:21:31,844
Why?

287
00:21:34,282 --> 00:21:36,307
Dr. Summers, please.

288
00:21:38,043 --> 00:21:39,153
Okay.

289
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:41,095
Put on your seatbelt.

290
00:21:56,506 --> 00:21:57,379
Where are we going?

291
00:21:57,505 --> 00:21:59,507
Drive past that building,
but don't stop.

292
00:21:59,626 --> 00:22:00,108
Okay.

293
00:22:10,525 --> 00:22:11,973
There!
There, he is.

294
00:22:17,693 --> 00:22:18,877
That man was here the other day.

295
00:22:19,029 --> 00:22:20,623
He's been following me.

296
00:22:21,783 --> 00:22:22,678
Who is he?

297
00:22:23,071 --> 00:22:25,663
I think he's with airlines.
They've been monitoring us.

298
00:22:25,728 --> 00:22:27,855
Why.. why would they do that?

299
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:32,265
The other night, when Dean said
he remembered a flash...

300
00:22:32,337 --> 00:22:36,697
or something bright,
like a fire, or an explosion...

301
00:22:37,954 --> 00:22:39,426
it started coming back to me.

302
00:22:41,178 --> 00:22:43,795
They're saying that the pilot missed
the approach or some bullshit.

303
00:22:44,762 --> 00:22:46,724
That's wrong.

304
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:51,286
There was an explosion on board,
I remember it now, too.

305
00:22:51,428 --> 00:22:53,556
Why would they lie
about something like that?

306
00:22:53,782 --> 00:22:57,133
They had another accident, last year,
off the coast of California.

307
00:22:57,293 --> 00:23:00,287
A mechnical failure, another problem
like that would sink them.

308
00:23:01,374 --> 00:23:03,030
They're after us now.

309
00:23:03,463 --> 00:23:06,064
Norman, we can't assume that.

310
00:23:06,191 --> 00:23:08,545
You don't know these people.
A corporation like this...

311
00:23:08,648 --> 00:23:11,881
it's all about money, they are capable
of anything to save their asses.

312
00:23:12,255 --> 00:23:15,385
Norman, I understand that you feel
vulnerable right now...

313
00:23:15,449 --> 00:23:19,291
and paranoid feelings are common
amongst people who have been through...

314
00:23:19,322 --> 00:23:22,115
what you've just been through, but.. uh...

315
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:26,603
I don't think the airline is
after you, okay?

316
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:32,293
Let me take you home, where do you live?

317
00:24:01,823 --> 00:24:04,175
[Phone ringing]

318
00:24:06,223 --> 00:24:08,368
Hi, you've reached Hannah,
Paul, Luke, and Emma.

319
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,912
Leave us a message.

320
00:24:11,855 --> 00:24:14,802
Hi, Emma, it's Claire.
I left you a message...

321
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,178
which wasn't easy, but I'm trying, okay?

322
00:24:21,122 --> 00:24:25,083
But we're grown-ups, you know,
let's agree to disagree...

323
00:24:25,189 --> 00:24:28,644
you live your life the way you want,
and I live my life the way I want--

324
00:24:33,231 --> 00:24:34,862

Yeah.

Turns out that it's not that difficult
once you dive right into it.

I don't know.

No thanks.

Yeah.

No.

I don't know, I just..
you.. saw.. put together.

I have a theory about women who
are beautiful, 'cause you're beautiful...

who bury themselves under
layers of crap, like you do.

- Do you want to hear my theory or not?
- Fine.

They're afraid of being desirable.

How touchy feely,
maybe you should have your own show.

Hey!

How does one become
an expert in disasters?

382

I study children with severe traumas.

Children who have shut-off.

384
00:29:39,717 --> 00:29:41,014
Where do you start?

385
00:29:43,023 --> 00:29:45,329
Uh.. by learning their language.

386
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:52,955
Most of these kids dress up the facts
with fantasies, imaginary friends...

387
00:29:53,034 --> 00:29:57,530
storytelling, I..
find my way into their story...

388
00:29:58,418 --> 00:30:00,122
and I find my way back to the truth.

389

Are you afraid of dogs?

Of course, not.

391

Because, you know, it's common
among post-traumatic patients...

to develop phobias--

00:30:35,156 --> 00:30:37,988
Yeah.
Of course.

In fact, you know what?
Here.

398
00:30:44,317 --> 00:30:46,415
It's a key.
It's not my hand in marriage.

399
00:30:46,526 --> 00:30:48,214
In case I can't hear
the doorbell or something.

400
00:30:48,278 --> 00:30:50,743
No, I will call first next time. That's
what I really should've done today.

401
00:30:50,999 --> 00:30:54,328
- Sorry.
- C'mon, hey, slow down.

00:31:14,268 --> 00:31:16,661
Okay.
Some ground rules.

00:31:17,853 --> 00:31:21,549
We are not dating. We're having
conversations that may help you...

408
00:31:21,654 --> 00:31:23,542
release some of the feelings
that you're repressing.

409
00:31:23,676 --> 00:31:26,077
I would say my feelings
are not being repressed at all.

410
00:31:26,255 --> 00:31:28,975
I will listen to you, and
you will stop coming on to me.

- All right.

Yes, quid pro quo, tit for tat.

Shut up.

Okay, doctor.

418
00:31:48,299 --> 00:31:49,203
All right.

- Bye, Eric.
- Something was in your mouth.

420
00:31:53,407 --> 00:31:54,657

00:32:35,208 --> 00:32:35,937
Yep.

Sure.

431
00:32:58,941 --> 00:33:00,068
Your key.

432
00:33:00,502 --> 00:33:01,283
Yeah.

433
00:33:01,382 --> 00:33:03,773
- A lover's key.
- No.

434
00:33:04,325 --> 00:33:06,110
No, no, he's an acquaintance.

435
00:33:06,325 --> 00:33:10,679
An acquaintance who gives away his key,
where do I sign up?

436
00:33:12,391 --> 00:33:15,560
Actually, he's a patient, sort of.

437
00:33:16,591 --> 00:33:17,928
Do you like him?

438
00:33:19,024 --> 00:33:19,808
No.

No?

440
00:33:21,832 --> 00:33:23,687
Look me in the eye and say that.

441
00:33:27,466 --> 00:33:29,138
I don't like him, he's a patient.

442
00:33:29,771 --> 00:33:32,522
So, even if I liked him,
it'd constitute a conflict of interests...

443
00:33:33,491 --> 00:33:35,477
- it's an ethical..
- Right...

444
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:38,779
- and then you'd have to stop seeing him.
- Right.

445
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:41,091
And you'd have to put him
out of your mind.

446
00:33:41,371 --> 00:33:45,390
- Yeah.
- Right. I've lived like that.

447
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:47,622

Oh? Uh... nothing.

How do you know where I live?

463
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:47,649
It's in here.

464
00:34:47,754 --> 00:34:49,361
You left it in my place.

465
00:34:49,426 --> 00:34:50,955
I thought you might need it
for tomorrow.

Sorry 'bout that.

467
00:34:53,001 --> 00:34:54,188
No, it's okay.

468
00:34:54,364 --> 00:34:56,132
So, are you.. are you okay?

469
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:58,570
Are you gonna invite me in.. or.. ?

470
00:34:59,108 --> 00:34:59,891
No.

471
00:35:00,419 --> 00:35:01,579
Got somebody in there?

472
00:35:01,652 --> 00:35:02,900
No.

473
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:05,317
I mean, it's not any of your business.

474
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,119
Anyway, this isn't my normal office hours.

475

I'm not a patient.

No, you're just a creepy guy standing
at my door in the middle of night.

00:35:18,169 --> 00:35:20,576
A lovely man. Intriguing.

Okay, good night.

You don't think so?

480

I'm not gonna stand here
and debate your loveliness.

481
00:35:28,546 --> 00:35:30,371
How about the intriguing part?

491
00:36:32,311 --> 00:36:34,195
What's your theory for this?

492
00:36:34,312 --> 00:36:35,904
Why are they missing?

493
00:36:43,795 --> 00:36:47,915
I'm so sorry. Would you mind
excusing me for a moment?

494
00:36:48,089 --> 00:36:49,451
Okay, go.

495
00:37:02,788 --> 00:37:04,718
What are you doing here, Mr. Arkin?

496
00:37:05,828 --> 00:37:08,359
I'm interested in
the health of the passengers.

497
00:37:08,501 --> 00:37:10,535
You're interested in
what they remember.

498
00:37:10,638 --> 00:37:12,879
Yes, of course I am.

499
00:37:18,322 --> 00:37:22,256
You're patients are highly susceptible
to external influences right now.

500
00:37:22,385 --> 00:37:27,194
So, you just be sure you haven't been
feeding them your own theories.

501
00:37:27,858 --> 00:37:30,435
Have you been able to confirm
that the accident was human error?

502
00:37:30,538 --> 00:37:35,492
It's always a human error, doctor,
whichever way you turn it.

503
00:37:35,588 --> 00:37:39,204
Someone didn't work hard enough,
or well enough, or cared enough...

504
00:37:39,244 --> 00:37:41,388
someone made a mistake.

505
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:45,639
And in this case, it was an..
overworked pilot.

506
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:47,837
You're blaming your woes to a dead man.

507
00:37:51,629 --> 00:37:53,520
Stay away. I mean it.

508
00:38:07,842 --> 00:38:08,915
Claire!

509
00:38:09,531 --> 00:38:10,516
Eric?

510
00:38:11,532 --> 00:38:13,117
Hey!

511
00:38:14,124 --> 00:38:16,877
Eric! Uh.. Eric.. okay...

512
00:38:17,029 --> 00:38:19,382
stay away from the edge, okay?
What are you doing?

513
00:38:19,574 --> 00:38:20,310
Just..

514
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:22,030
Come on up!

515
00:38:22,846 --> 00:38:23,678
Uhm...

516
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:25,038
C'mon!

517
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:27,711
I'm not so good with heights.

518
00:38:28,496 --> 00:38:30,168
(Chuckling)

519
00:38:54,477 --> 00:38:55,278
Are you all right?

520
00:38:56,013 --> 00:38:57,526
No.. I.. I'm good. I'm just fine here.

521
00:38:58,206 --> 00:38:59,901
C'mon, come here. C'mon.

522
00:39:00,781 --> 00:39:02,397
Eric! Eric, stop it!

523
00:39:03,047 --> 00:39:05,279
I'm sorry. Okay. Here we go.

524
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:06,656
Do you have me?

525
00:39:07,607 --> 00:39:09,951
Oh, God. Jesus.

526
00:39:12,786 --> 00:39:13,946
- Stay there.
- I'm good.

527
00:39:28,525 --> 00:39:31,668
We can't seem to stay away
from each other, can we?

528
00:39:35,693 --> 00:39:36,755
So, what's your sign?

529
00:39:39,078 --> 00:39:42,813
(Laughing)

530
00:39:42,958 --> 00:39:45,038
I was almost married once.

531
00:39:45,438 --> 00:39:47,919
I bailed two days before the wedding.

532
00:39:50,504 --> 00:39:52,063
That's...

533
00:39:52,199 --> 00:39:53,303
that's terrible.

534
00:39:53,439 --> 00:39:57,160
Yeah, it is.

535
00:39:57,936 --> 00:39:59,440
It was very painful for her.

536
00:40:02,344 --> 00:40:03,792
I was scared.

537
00:40:06,811 --> 00:40:09,106
You know what's scary about commitment?

538
00:40:10,507 --> 00:40:14,228
Your life becomes real.
It's not a plan.

539
00:40:14,533 --> 00:40:17,396
It's not what you hope for.
It's real.

540
00:40:20,948 --> 00:40:22,170
Your turn.

541
00:40:24,276 --> 00:40:27,758
C'mon, give me something.
Fair is fair. Tit for tat.

542
00:40:28,271 --> 00:40:30,021
There is nothing to tell.

543
00:40:31,392 --> 00:40:33,776
I've never been close.
Sometimes, they left me.

544
00:40:33,897 --> 00:40:35,770
Sometimes, I left them.

545
00:40:37,314 --> 00:40:41,074
There is no sob story.
Not really.

546
00:40:42,692 --> 00:40:44,193
That was very you.

547
00:40:45,473 --> 00:40:47,562
Concise, yet vague.

548
00:40:47,753 --> 00:40:50,475
I'm not like that.
I like clarity.

549
00:40:51,986 --> 00:40:53,579
Clarity for Claire.

550
00:40:54,067 --> 00:40:56,516
I'm so glad I'm amusing you.

551
00:40:57,995 --> 00:41:00,699
C'mon, this is miraculous, isn't it?
We're both sitting here?

552
00:41:04,292 --> 00:41:05,556
That crash.

553
00:41:08,254 --> 00:41:11,094
It's like being born again.

554
00:41:22,008 --> 00:41:23,000
Eric?

555
00:41:23,872 --> 00:41:26,393
Eric! Oh, my God, Eric!

556
00:41:29,202 --> 00:41:30,202
What?

557
00:41:30,385 --> 00:41:33,410
You, bastard?!
You, fu--

558
00:41:34,365 --> 00:41:35,867
(Chuckling) C'mon.

559
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:51,382
Yeah.

560
00:41:51,565 --> 00:41:53,015
I'm not getting on that thing.

561
00:41:53,383 --> 00:41:54,710
Why not?

562
00:41:56,463 --> 00:41:57,695
You're not wearing a helmet?

563
00:41:58,735 --> 00:41:59,999
For crying out aloud, c'mon.

564
00:42:03,207 --> 00:42:04,896
Why did you come here tonight?

565
00:42:33,238 --> 00:42:34,406
Too fast for you?

566
00:42:34,741 --> 00:42:35,982
No.

567
00:43:02,278 --> 00:43:06,256
Uh, so do we need safety vests?

568
00:43:07,351 --> 00:43:09,824
There might be safety vests in there.

569
00:43:10,085 --> 00:43:12,177
Aren't they called life preservers?
Ah, perfect.

570
00:43:15,794 --> 00:43:18,994
So, uh.. this is a nice boat.

571
00:43:19,602 --> 00:43:20,883
It is, isn't it?

572
00:43:21,306 --> 00:43:22,867
Yeah, how long have you had her?

573
00:43:22,955 --> 00:43:24,663
Oh, it's not mine.

574
00:43:24,716 --> 00:43:25,715
Then whose is it?

575
00:43:25,762 --> 00:43:26,939
I have no idea.

576
00:43:26,988 --> 00:43:28,915
What?

577
00:43:29,021 --> 00:43:30,741
- What?
- Watch your head.

Eric.

579
00:43:33,005 --> 00:43:34,102
Can you drive a boat?

580
00:43:34,277 --> 00:43:35,582
Yeah.

581
00:43:35,701 --> 00:43:37,798
Great, that's wonderful.

582
00:43:43,791 --> 00:43:45,023
Wanna take it?

583
00:43:45,199 --> 00:43:46,583
Oh, no.

584
00:43:46,662 --> 00:43:48,272

What are you doing?

588
00:44:06,979 --> 00:44:08,300
Going for a swim.

589
00:44:08,423 --> 00:44:11,067
What? Are you serious.. it's freezing.

590
00:44:11,412 --> 00:44:17,063
No, well.. yeah,
will be freezing for a moment.

591
00:44:17,174 --> 00:44:19,335
Then, it'll be okay.

592
00:44:25,223 --> 00:44:27,320
You're just looking
for thrills to feel alive...

593
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:29,024
it's a normal reaction.

594
00:44:39,099 --> 00:44:40,475
Eric, is it cold?

595
00:44:45,315 --> 00:44:47,011
Okay, I'm not falling for this again.

596
00:44:47,107 --> 00:44:52,117
Eric! Seriously, it's not funny.
Stop it!

You've scared the hell out of me!

600
00:45:08,466 --> 00:45:09,656
I thought you were drowning.

00:45:09,896 --> 00:45:11,050
No.

602
00:45:11,833 --> 00:45:13,297
Why are you wearing your clothes?

603
00:45:15,432 --> 00:45:16,826
Did you jump in to save me?

604
00:45:17,851 --> 00:45:18,778
No.

605
00:45:19,475 --> 00:45:21,281
Come here. Where are you going?

606
00:45:21,449 --> 00:45:23,715
C'mon, come back.
Stay a while.

See. It's not so cold.

I'm a mess.

613
00:46:53,924 --> 00:46:55,739
- Too late, Claire.
- For what?

614
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:58,805
To scare me away.

615
00:47:05,606 --> 00:47:06,589
Eric...

616
00:47:07,629 --> 00:47:10,749
the first time we met,
you asked me if I had a sister.

617
00:47:14,728 --> 00:47:15,928
Do you have one?

618
00:47:16,392 --> 00:47:17,616
Yeah.

619
00:47:18,128 --> 00:47:20,265
Yeah, you seemed to know that.

620
00:47:21,289 --> 00:47:25,209
Maybe, is that, bossy,
older sister thing you've got--

Not.. you're..

What is she like?

624
00:47:41,270 --> 00:47:45,054
She's an activist, a risk-taker.

625
00:47:49,184 --> 00:47:50,680
She's a really good mom.

She's got many things.

Ah...

628
00:47:58,426 --> 00:48:00,266
so, what's the problem?

629
00:48:01,242 --> 00:48:04,498
She called me a coward,
and said that I was wasting my life.

630
00:48:05,939 --> 00:48:08,530
I said some pretty horrible things to her.

631
00:48:11,372 --> 00:48:13,973
Stuff I shouldn't have said,
stuff that I--

00:48:15,261 --> 00:48:17,701
Anyway, we haven't spoken in months.

633
00:48:18,686 --> 00:48:20,494
Whatever was said...

634
00:48:21,942 --> 00:48:23,847
it's not worth it.

regular part of your therapy?

or they missed sessions?

657
00:51:22,867 --> 00:51:24,234
I'm not sure.

658
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:28,066
Well, just because they're not at
the sessions doesn't mean...

659
00:51:27,856 --> 00:51:28,937
they're in trouble.

660
00:51:29,732 --> 00:51:31,595
And patients fall in and out
of the desire for treatment...

661
00:51:31,619 --> 00:51:33,683
all the time, isn't that common?

662
00:51:33,714 --> 00:51:35,307
Absolutely, right.

663
00:51:35,979 --> 00:51:37,483
What about Eric Clark?

664
00:51:37,524 --> 00:51:39,196
What?

665
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:41,189
How is he doing?

666
00:51:41,275 --> 00:51:43,340
Oh.. good.

667
00:51:49,205 --> 00:51:52,854
He.. he's... responding...

668
00:51:55,991 --> 00:51:57,783
I don't know, I don't know.

669
00:52:06,881 --> 00:52:08,354
Claire, what's going on?

670
00:52:10,538 --> 00:52:12,338
I crossed the line with him.

671
00:52:13,851 --> 00:52:15,502
An ethical line.

672
00:52:18,875 --> 00:52:23,396
Our relationship is more personal
than it should be.

673
00:52:28,301 --> 00:52:31,615
(sigh) More personal than
it should be.

674
00:52:31,935 --> 00:52:33,327
Yeah.

676
00:53:37,474 --> 00:53:39,026
Hello, Norman?

677
00:53:42,810 --> 00:53:46,075
Norman, it's Dr. Summers, Claire.

678
00:54:00,351 --> 00:54:01,718
Norman.

679
00:54:39,733 --> 00:54:40,574
Hey!

680
00:54:42,118 --> 00:54:43,518
Wait! Don't go!

681
00:54:44,326 --> 00:54:48,208
Hey, stop! Don't go!
Please.

682
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:53,465
Help me! Please, help!

683
00:55:01,114 --> 00:55:02,889
Help me!

684
00:55:25,551 --> 00:55:26,791
Do you know me?

685
00:55:29,022 --> 00:55:30,008
No.

686
00:55:31,552 --> 00:55:33,687
I can't remember my own name,
and everything.

687
00:55:33,792 --> 00:55:36,143
Why have you been hanging
around the sessions?

688
00:55:36,186 --> 00:55:38,561
I followed one of them
the other day.

689
00:55:38,601 --> 00:55:40,996
The guy who lives here.

690
00:55:41,034 --> 00:55:43,154
He looked familiar.

691
00:55:43,203 --> 00:55:45,521
I thought he could help me
figure things out.

692
00:55:45,554 --> 00:55:47,850
But he wouldn't come near me.

693
00:55:47,875 --> 00:55:50,324
I can't get anything out
since the accident.

694
00:55:50,354 --> 00:55:52,148
You witnessed the accident?

695
00:55:52,172 --> 00:55:53,372
I was in it.

696
00:55:53,396 --> 00:55:54,251
You were on the flight?

697
00:55:54,291 --> 00:55:55,291
Yes.

698
00:55:56,165 --> 00:55:59,149
One moment, I'm sitting there...

699
00:55:59,181 --> 00:56:04,375
and there is an explosion,
and I'm here, walking around...

700
00:56:04,399 --> 00:56:05,989
what the hell happened?

701
00:56:10,311 --> 00:56:11,559
It's okay.

702
00:56:11,935 --> 00:56:14,097
Have you told anyone else
about this?

703
00:56:14,352 --> 00:56:17,665
No. Who could I talk to?
I don't know any one here.

704
00:56:20,633 --> 00:56:23,307
I'd like you to come with me, please.

705
00:56:23,451 --> 00:56:25,003
Perry, it's Claire.

706
00:56:25,306 --> 00:56:27,243
I need to talk to you,
call me as soon as you get this.

00:56:29,716 --> 00:56:31,284

Mr. Arkin.

713
00:59:10,704 --> 00:59:13,164
This man was on board, Mr. Arkin.
He remembers an explosion.

714
00:59:16,059 --> 00:59:19,260
For a woman of science, you have
a strong flare for dramatic, doctor.

715
00:59:19,292 --> 00:59:21,541
Passengers are missing, Mr. Arkin.
What do you know about that?

716
00:59:21,564 --> 00:59:22,517
Calm down, please.

Where are the other passengers?

00:59:24,925 --> 00:59:26,165
Hiding from you, I bet.

- You're making a fool of yourself.
- ..what's going on?

00:59:29,686 --> 00:59:30,846
I know you.

No.

- Yes.
- No.

No, we haven't.

on a trail.. he was trying
to rescue her, and they both fell.

They were probably crushed

What would you tell them now?

01:09:18,046 --> 01:09:19,318
they are missing.

825
01:09:20,126 --> 01:09:23,078
What if survivors weren't even
accounted for? How does that happen?

826
01:09:23,743 --> 01:09:27,287
I don't know. I'm..
how do you think it happens?

827
01:09:27,336 --> 01:09:29,966
I think the airline is
targetting the passengers.

828
01:09:30,823 --> 01:09:32,616
One by one, they are all disappearing.

829
01:09:33,328 --> 01:09:35,465
Maybe, they don't need you anymore.

830
01:09:35,576 --> 01:09:37,017
We got to stop this, Perry.

831
01:09:38,377 --> 01:09:40,010
You're looking for the truth?

832
01:09:41,210 --> 01:09:42,362
Yes!

833
01:09:42,738 --> 01:09:46,923
When we lie, we make up
our lies with pieces.. of the truth.

834
01:09:47,995 --> 01:09:49,507
What does that
have to do with this?

835
01:09:49,619 --> 01:09:51,995
So, there must be some reason
why you've latched on...

836
01:09:52,027 --> 01:09:54,700
to this elaborate theory
of a cover-up.

837
01:09:55,364 --> 01:09:56,413
What?

838
01:09:56,605 --> 01:09:59,013
Maybe it's gone as far as it can.

839
01:10:01,398 --> 01:10:03,055
They got to you, Arkin got to you.

840
01:10:03,110 --> 01:10:04,921
No. Claire.

841
01:10:05,463 --> 01:10:06,619
It's not like that.

842
01:10:07,594 --> 01:10:10,356
Don't you come near me.
Don't!

843
01:10:17,614 --> 01:10:21,669
Is that why you brought me in?
To keep tabs on the passengers?

844
01:10:24,423 --> 01:10:26,768
It's not me.
You don't know me.

845
01:11:17,041 --> 01:11:18,010
They're dead.

846
01:11:23,171 --> 01:11:25,740
They are all dead.

847
01:11:32,853 --> 01:11:34,628
That pilot.. he was...

848
01:11:37,798 --> 01:11:39,215
he was tired.

849
01:11:41,407 --> 01:11:43,776
He was in the middle of a divorce.

850
01:11:45,496 --> 01:11:51,160
He wasn't even in the cockpit
when it happened.

851
01:11:51,272 --> 01:11:53,145
Did you know that?

852
01:11:53,329 --> 01:11:54,954
Where was he?

853
01:12:00,003 --> 01:12:02,314
He left it in the hands of the copilot.

854
01:12:03,314 --> 01:12:05,101
He never should've done that.

855
01:12:05,212 --> 01:12:07,140
It wasn't him.

856
01:12:07,578 --> 01:12:10,709
The passengers saw that explosion
outside of the window.

857
01:12:11,228 --> 01:12:13,454
No. It had nothing to do
with the pilot.

858
01:12:13,486 --> 01:12:14,493
No.

859
01:12:14,534 --> 01:12:16,278
He tried his best to land
the plane on the beach.

860
01:12:16,326 --> 01:12:18,278
If anyone made it,
it was because of him.

861
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:19,310
You're wrong.

862
01:12:19,350 --> 01:12:20,704
That man is hero.

863
01:12:20,751 --> 01:12:22,664
You are wrong!

864
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:25,520
No.

865
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:40,557
It.. w..as... me..

866
01:12:41,565 --> 01:12:42,796
What?

867
01:12:49,950 --> 01:12:51,558
What did you say?

868
01:14:02,564 --> 01:14:03,781
I'm in your seat. Sorry.

869
01:14:15,957 --> 01:14:27,034
No, no, no..
No! No! No!

870
01:14:30,114 --> 01:14:34,057
[Sobbing]

871
01:15:01,591 --> 01:15:02,737
Good morning.

872
01:15:03,792 --> 01:15:05,457
Good morning.

873
01:15:10,817 --> 01:15:12,418
I found something.

874
01:15:13,650 --> 01:15:14,841
What's that?

875
01:15:15,106 --> 01:15:16,901
A list of passengers.

876
01:15:26,701 --> 01:15:28,166
Why didn't you tell me?

877
01:15:29,375 --> 01:15:31,725
It's not a sort of thing you can be told.

878
01:15:33,389 --> 01:15:35,374
You gotta figure it out for yourself.

879
01:15:37,167 --> 01:15:38,686
When you are ready.

880
01:15:50,393 --> 01:15:51,745
Here you go.

881
01:15:52,136 --> 01:15:52,857
Sorry.

882
01:15:53,121 --> 01:15:54,786
- Oh, thank you.
- Sure.

883
01:15:56,690 --> 01:15:57,963
Coming or going?

884
01:15:59,004 --> 01:16:00,066
Going home.

885
01:16:00,362 --> 01:16:01,835
Me, too.

886
01:16:03,179 --> 01:16:04,124
Eric.

887
01:16:04,284 --> 01:16:05,813
Claire Summers.

888
01:16:33,146 --> 01:16:35,273
People come back to help you.

889
01:16:35,602 --> 01:16:38,930
Come to terms, lead the way.

890
01:16:40,003 --> 01:16:42,515
My grandfather came back for me.

891
01:16:42,554 --> 01:16:44,748
I didn't even recognize him.

892
01:16:45,724 --> 01:16:47,076
And my dog.

893
01:16:47,764 --> 01:16:49,013
(sigh)

894
01:16:56,805 --> 01:16:58,975
Who came back for you?

895
01:17:13,297 --> 01:17:14,897
My aunt, Toni.

896
01:17:19,419 --> 01:17:21,097
And Mr. Perry.

897
01:17:35,190 --> 01:17:37,030
What about the other passengers?

898
01:17:37,119 --> 01:17:38,799
They're like us.

899
01:17:38,918 --> 01:17:41,583
Making their peace with it
before moving on.

900
01:17:43,144 --> 01:17:45,479
Nobody survived the crash.

901
01:17:56,746 --> 01:17:58,153
And everyone else?

902
01:18:00,723 --> 01:18:04,035
They're just here
to help us find our way.

903
01:18:04,070 --> 01:18:25,216
Can we.. hook up in town..
I promise not to bite.

904
01:18:27,425 --> 01:18:28,744
Okay, I promise to bite.

905
01:18:31,210 --> 01:18:32,440
Uh.. okay.

906
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:34,777
- Cool.
- Yeah.

907
01:19:06,505 --> 01:19:07,648
Hey!

908
01:19:20,083 --> 01:19:21,330
Oh, my God!

909
01:19:23,796 --> 01:19:25,059
[Explosion]

910
01:19:33,844 --> 01:19:36,830
Put this on.
Put it on. C'mon.

911
01:19:43,391 --> 01:19:45,335
We're gonna die. We're gonna die.

912
01:19:45,382 --> 01:19:47,001
No, we're gonna live.
Look at me. Hey, stay with me.

913
01:19:47,057 --> 01:19:49,287
Look at me!

914
01:19:49,649 --> 01:19:53,896
Emma, Emma, I love you.
Emma..

915
01:20:23,471 --> 01:20:27,535
Get down with me.
Claire, c'mon. Get down with me.

916
01:20:27,591 --> 01:20:30,817
Don't give up on me.
Don't give up on me. C'mon.

917
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:37,065
- We're not gonna make it.
- Yes, we are.

918
01:20:37,649 --> 01:20:42,458
Yes, we are. Yes, we are.
Yes, yes!

919
01:20:43,123 --> 01:20:45,146
You stay right here
with me, okay?

920
01:20:45,186 --> 01:20:48,572
You stay here.
Don't go.

921
01:20:48,861 --> 01:20:50,372
Stay with me.

922
01:21:42,220 --> 01:21:46,114
I will be right up
with your sister's mail.

923
