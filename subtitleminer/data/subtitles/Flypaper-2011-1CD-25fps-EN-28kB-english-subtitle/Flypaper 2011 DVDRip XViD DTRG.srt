1
00:02:38,233 --> 00:02:42,859
Quick, honey. We have already closed.
- This is not acceptable.

2
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,844
As I've discussed it yesterday.

3
00:02:44,944 --> 00:02:49,311
A massage at sunset with Tanya.
It should be Tanya.

4
00:02:49,694 --> 00:02:51,936
I need to know that the bank safe.

5
00:02:52,036 --> 00:02:55,166
Trust me. I have dozens of banks
updated. It'll be fine.

6
00:02:55,266 --> 00:02:58,403
I need guarantees.
- Gordon, you do.

7
00:02:58,503 --> 00:03:00,845
It's a security update.
Not the end of the world.

8
00:03:00,945 --> 00:03:04,749
I swear, if I leave again
Cooperstown should work and I miss...

9
00:03:04,849 --> 00:03:08,604
I burn the whole thing flat.
- I see you. We all have plans.

10
00:03:08,704 --> 00:03:11,612
Mr. Sullivan, it is always a pleasure
to see you.

11
00:03:11,712 --> 00:03:14,158
I have this massage
one month ago planned.

12
00:03:14,258 --> 00:03:17,574
No, I want Tanya.
Her hands and small pneumatic drills.

13
00:03:17,674 --> 00:03:20,169
Who can I get?
Jonathan?

14
00:03:20,269 --> 00:03:23,639
He has strong hands?

15
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:13,485
Look at you.

16
00:04:20,367 --> 00:04:22,875
How may I help you?
- One hundred dollar exchange.

17
00:04:22,975 --> 00:04:26,634
How would you like it?
- Seven pennies, 31 quarters...

18
00:04:26,734 --> 00:04:29,300
...and 919 cents.
- What?

19
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,433
That's too much money.
Than 107 pennies, 839 pennies...

20
00:04:34,533 --> 00:04:39,604
...29 quarters and half dollars 7 pieces.

21
00:04:42,746 --> 00:04:45,872
Is that Chile?

22
00:04:45,972 --> 00:04:48,685
Brazil.
- The U.S. dollar half I never use...

23
00:04:48,785 --> 00:04:53,740
I can 101 pennies,
157 cents and 557 cents.

24
00:04:54,412 --> 00:04:57,758
That's a joke.
- No, I did something with coins.

25
00:04:57,858 --> 00:05:02,448
I love the weight, size
and how they ring in my pocket.

26
00:05:02,743 --> 00:05:05,636
That's pretty weird.
- What?

27
00:05:05,736 --> 00:05:08,813
The figures that you enumerated.
101, 157, 557...

28
00:05:08,913 --> 00:05:12,015
...these are all primes.
- That no one ever noticed.

29
00:05:12,115 --> 00:05:14,495
I work with numbers all day.

30
00:05:14,582 --> 00:05:17,579
You do so in your head?
- Yes, good with math trick.

31
00:05:17,679 --> 00:05:19,388
I suppose so.
- What's your name?

32
00:05:19,488 --> 00:05:21,259
Kaitlin.
- I'm Tripp.

33
00:05:21,359 --> 00:05:24,316
Actually...

34
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:27,437
...we do not hand customers.

35
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,955
Mobile phones on.

36
00:05:45,055 --> 00:05:48,723
Where are you located?
- How do you know?

37
00:05:50,514 --> 00:05:53,174
My wedding presents.
- That's quite a few.

38
00:05:53,274 --> 00:05:55,432
Are you going to marry
Jay Z or something?

39
00:05:55,532 --> 00:05:56,534
My fiance's wealthy.

40
00:05:56,634 --> 00:06:00,909
Wealthy?
Over two days, they married in Brunei.

41
00:06:01,587 --> 00:06:03,943
My husband takes me disagree
along to the Sizzler.

42
00:06:04,043 --> 00:06:10,077
He is rich. But is he happy?
- We are very happy. Glad you asked.

43
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,852
Darrien present.
- Weinstein present.

44
00:06:13,952 --> 00:06:17,694
Gates present.
- We go. Unlock the weapons.

45
00:06:20,197 --> 00:06:23,512
That's the door.
Use the remote control.

46
00:06:26,725 --> 00:06:29,781
Come on.

47
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:42,280
One, two, three, four, five...

48
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:47,653
...six and one seven.
Anything else I can do for you today?

49
00:06:47,753 --> 00:06:49,753
No, thanks.

50
00:06:49,845 --> 00:06:54,563
Thank you chose Credit International,
required a great day.

51
00:06:54,663 --> 00:06:59,500
You squeaks.
- I need my medications.

52
00:07:01,157 --> 00:07:03,928
Is there a pharmacy nearby.
- Two blocks from here.

53
00:07:04,028 --> 00:07:05,391
Nice to meet you, Kaitlin.

54
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:09,061
Likewise, Tripp.
Good luck with everything.

55
00:07:22,695 --> 00:07:25,436
You are being robbed.

56
00:07:27,815 --> 00:07:30,208
What are you doing?

57
00:07:30,308 --> 00:07:33,033
This is a robbery.

58
00:07:33,133 --> 00:07:35,771
What are you doing here?
- What does it look?

59
00:07:35,871 --> 00:07:36,871
You rob the bank.

60
00:07:36,971 --> 00:07:38,966
This is obvious with
the weapons and stuff?

61
00:07:39,066 --> 00:07:41,012
No, this is our work.
Go back.

62
00:07:41,112 --> 00:07:44,263
I see your name on the board outside.

63
00:07:44,832 --> 00:07:47,914
Unless his name is Credit.

64
00:07:48,014 --> 00:07:52,049
Given all the weird names that the parents
give their children these days.

65
00:07:52,149 --> 00:07:54,907
The alarm does not work.
- The phone does not.

66
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:58,086
What do we do?
- Proceed as planned.

67
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:04,849
Select the security update.

68
00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:07,146
If the system is rebooted,
The entire bank closed.

69
00:08:07,246 --> 00:08:09,802
We know. Turn on the quiet,
or I'll shoot you in the face.

70
00:08:09,902 --> 00:08:13,685
Wait a minute, boy.
Do it.

71
00:08:19,745 --> 00:08:22,529
You have exactly three seconds
to go back...

72
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:26,790
...or will shoot at you.
- There are plenty of ATM machines.

73
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:29,713
A...
- Two blasts off on it.

74
00:08:29,813 --> 00:08:33,851
I heard that.
- Two, three.

75
00:09:06,736 --> 00:09:09,049
It's now or never.

76
00:09:31,859 --> 00:09:33,328
He saves not.
- Go down.

77
00:09:33,428 --> 00:09:38,091
What?
- Hello?

78
00:09:39,591 --> 00:09:42,020
I know your heart sitting in a firefight...

79
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,159
...there is a wounded.
I look as if everything is okay.

80
00:09:45,259 --> 00:09:48,719
I come down.
Do not shoot.

81
00:09:48,819 --> 00:09:52,028
Do not shoot.

82
00:09:52,128 --> 00:09:53,958
I can shoot.
- We.

83
00:09:54,058 --> 00:09:57,524
Go back.
- Wait.

84
00:10:01,975 --> 00:10:04,800
Has anything ever happened to you?
- Certainly not.

85
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,330
He's dead.
- That happens sometimes...

86
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:11,800
...in the crossfire situations.
Do not look so hard for.

87
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,738
You are here for the safe, right?
- Who is this guy?

88
00:10:14,838 --> 00:10:18,238
He talked about cracking ATMs?
- Maybe.

89
00:10:18,338 --> 00:10:21,846
What's the problem?

90
00:10:21,946 --> 00:10:25,079
Imagine now that we really
to rob the same bank?

91
00:10:25,179 --> 00:10:27,182
Yes, why not?

92
00:10:27,282 --> 00:10:30,819
Pretend it's two different banks.
- He has gone mad.

93
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:32,717
You do not here about it?

94
00:10:32,817 --> 00:10:35,028
I do not want to add more murders
more add to my list perpetrator.

95
00:10:35,128 --> 00:10:38,213
He wears shorts in a bank robbery.
We need to murder him.

96
00:10:38,313 --> 00:10:41,988
How old do you think?
- We need to murder him.

97
00:10:42,088 --> 00:10:44,303
Why do we have guns?
I want to shoot him.

98
00:10:44,403 --> 00:10:47,415
The guns were meant for hostages.
That was the plan.

99
00:10:47,515 --> 00:10:50,671
Now we have two hostages.
- What is our plan?

100
00:10:50,771 --> 00:10:53,458
If they want to bank with us rob, we do it.

101
00:10:53,558 --> 00:10:56,226
If they want to murder us,
We then murder them first.

102
00:10:56,326 --> 00:11:00,478
Cool plan.
- Listen. We take them to the vault.

103
00:11:00,578 --> 00:11:03,032
If the ATM you want, fine.

104
00:11:03,132 --> 00:11:05,887
Leave us alone.
- Roger that, big guy.

105
00:11:05,987 --> 00:11:08,835
That mean you do not?

106
00:11:10,075 --> 00:11:15,315
What does he want?
- That we come to him?

107
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,545
It's good. Come here you.
- Keep an eye on him.

108
00:11:21,627 --> 00:11:24,310
You're crazy.

109
00:11:25,588 --> 00:11:29,862
Want to come?
Put the guns down.

110
00:11:29,962 --> 00:11:33,457
Come here.
Let us introduce ourselves.

111
00:11:33,557 --> 00:11:35,849
We can still be friends?

112
00:11:35,949 --> 00:11:38,807
I'm Peanut Butter and this is Jelly.

113
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:41,836
Those are our real names.

114
00:11:41,936 --> 00:11:44,270
We wanted something that
sounded good together.

115
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,445
Milk and Cookies, and was already in use.

116
00:11:46,545 --> 00:11:48,987
That mean you do not?

117
00:11:49,772 --> 00:11:52,869
I want the hostages have now gone.

118
00:12:03,827 --> 00:12:10,013
Cell phones, pagers
everything that you or off the power.

119
00:12:10,113 --> 00:12:13,718
Of course guns. Thank you
guards are worthless.

120
00:12:13,818 --> 00:12:16,641
Guys, I have here.

121
00:12:16,741 --> 00:12:19,181
Obviously you here.
You're a hostage.

122
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:21,281
Get on it.

123
00:12:21,363 --> 00:12:24,385
Shut up and touch nothing.

124
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:31,499
Go to that door.

125
00:12:31,552 --> 00:12:34,527
May I...
- Stay away from that door.

126
00:12:45,942 --> 00:12:48,222
Please do not kill me on the toilet.

127
00:12:48,322 --> 00:12:51,042
What kind of assholes that here?

128
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,493
Are not you ashamed?

129
00:13:00,978 --> 00:13:06,174
Those guys are great.
- Fantastic.

130
00:13:15,156 --> 00:13:19,237
We apologize on behalf of the bank.

131
00:13:19,337 --> 00:13:23,336
Equally correct.
It really sorry.

132
00:13:23,436 --> 00:13:26,421
Please, Rex.
- I'm Rex Neubauer.

133
00:13:26,521 --> 00:13:28,690
I work for loans and we are lucky.

134
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:31,038
I am a certified consultant robbery.

135
00:13:31,138 --> 00:13:34,035
I got to 75 survivors of bank robberies
advice given.

136
00:13:34,135 --> 00:13:39,114
We'll work it out.
Our first goal is...

137
00:13:39,214 --> 00:13:42,392
...for a peaceful co-unity.
Can I help you?

138
00:13:42,492 --> 00:13:44,247
Our goal is to come live here.

139
00:13:44,347 --> 00:13:47,665
As an expert in standard
bank robberies procedures...

140
00:13:47,765 --> 00:13:51,606
This bank robbery is not standard.
Two robberies in progress.

141
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:54,674
And one dead. A guarantee that the robbers
come and murder us.

142
00:13:54,774 --> 00:13:57,799
Do not say that.
- I do not want to die.

143
00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:00,278
Let's stay calm.

144
00:14:11,698 --> 00:14:15,716
This bank is open five hours.
Then I and my colleagues have long gone.

145
00:14:15,816 --> 00:14:17,512
We're all trapped.

146
00:14:17,612 --> 00:14:21,686
Even if you come out of this kitchen
then you are not from the bank.

147
00:14:21,786 --> 00:14:29,022
So sit down and shut up.
- If we often go to the toilet?

148
00:14:29,122 --> 00:14:31,726
There's toilet break.
You will not try to escape...

149
00:14:31,826 --> 00:14:36,671
...or contact with someone
outside the bank. And no noise.

150
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,658
Alarm on your watch?
Are you in the sixth grade?

151
00:14:40,758 --> 00:14:43,200
It runs every hour.
In memory of my medications.

152
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:46,205
Unfortunately I have not.
Or has anyone Deprocaine?

153
00:14:46,305 --> 00:14:49,039
I have Xanax.
- I have Ativan and Prilosec.

154
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:51,512
I have a couple of Ritalin.
- I have maybe some Prozac.

155
00:14:51,612 --> 00:14:54,285
I Adderol and Nassonex.
- Are you kidding me?

156
00:14:54,385 --> 00:14:57,435
Shut up.
I just said, 'not talk'.

157
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:59,715
What's going on?
- Is Oprah's book club here?

158
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:01,324
Should I beat up someone? - No.

159
00:15:01,424 --> 00:15:03,688
Have you turned off the
cameras and computers?

160
00:15:03,788 --> 00:15:06,641
Do I really did not beat anyone up?
- I just said that.

161
00:15:06,741 --> 00:15:08,965
Go get the scrambler.

162
00:15:10,386 --> 00:15:12,919
That's ridiculous accent.

163
00:15:15,902 --> 00:15:20,832
Before we get to work,
let us first look at the other boys.

164
00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:30,338
I will start shortly with the lance,
ensure that the time slot is ready on time.

165
00:15:32,637 --> 00:15:36,546
No problems. We came
just look at your toys.

166
00:15:36,646 --> 00:15:40,046
You look so great.
- Did you see my face?

167
00:15:40,117 --> 00:15:43,094
Did you see my face?
- No.

168
00:15:43,194 --> 00:15:47,189
Admit it. Do not lie to me.
You've seen my face.

169
00:15:47,309 --> 00:15:51,507
I may have seen your face.
- I've seen it too.

170
00:15:51,607 --> 00:15:54,564
A very attractive face.
- Shut up.

171
00:15:55,383 --> 00:15:59,516
You are damn kids.

172
00:15:59,616 --> 00:16:02,686
You are worse than my kids.
You do not know...

173
00:16:02,786 --> 00:16:05,518
...what you are doing.
Have you ever rob a bank?

174
00:16:05,618 --> 00:16:08,701
A lot.
- We had the job with...

175
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:12,967
The Calahan brothers in Dubuque.
- What are you doing?

176
00:16:13,067 --> 00:16:17,198
That's what I mean.
Say nothing about those other jobs.

177
00:16:17,298 --> 00:16:19,460
And nothing about the people
you've done it.

178
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:23,454
Rob no bank without a mask.

179
00:16:23,554 --> 00:16:26,745
Come on, guys.
That's asking for trouble.

180
00:16:26,845 --> 00:16:30,101
Like your tattoos.
- Like them?

181
00:16:30,201 --> 00:16:34,210
Look at this.
You can try to tie me...

182
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:36,577
...but it does not.

183
00:16:45,003 --> 00:16:51,236
He did not understand. Do it again.
- I understand it really.

184
00:16:51,793 --> 00:16:54,834
I think I need to talk slower.

185
00:16:55,536 --> 00:17:03,568
Criminals usually try
their characteristics are not showing.

186
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:10,075
Duce not identified be.

187
00:17:14,212 --> 00:17:17,458
You can try to tie me,
but it does not.

188
00:17:17,558 --> 00:17:21,459
Go away.
All two.

189
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:26,178
Go away before I shoot you both down.

190
00:17:29,672 --> 00:17:32,631
You may have spouses
and wives who will panic...

191
00:17:32,731 --> 00:17:35,580
...when you get home tonight.
You may leave a ring.

192
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,364
You say that with
a friend to stay overnight...

193
00:17:38,464 --> 00:17:41,606
...and you will be persuasive.
Otherwise I'll shoot you mess.

194
00:17:41,706 --> 00:17:44,261
Who is first?
You?

195
00:17:44,361 --> 00:17:47,619
You? No?
You then, with that ugly tie.

196
00:18:01,324 --> 00:18:03,629
Honey?

197
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,141
Number two is done.
Now, number three.

198
00:18:10,241 --> 00:18:14,570
We are 49 minutes behind schedule.
- Copy that.

199
00:18:23,275 --> 00:18:25,345
I always got that blue stuff...

200
00:18:25,445 --> 00:18:29,495
...this was on sale.
- I love that you're so economical.

201
00:18:29,595 --> 00:18:33,420
Maybe we should be sure
read the instructions.

202
00:18:36,168 --> 00:18:39,855
Is that Korean?
- No, Chinese.

203
00:18:39,955 --> 00:18:46,445
Chinese are icons.
- Is that so? Explosives are explosives.

204
00:18:47,013 --> 00:18:52,389
I come tonight to the airport...

205
00:18:52,489 --> 00:18:58,864
My mother is sick and I stay with her.
Maybe we can go tomorrow. I love you.

206
00:19:00,718 --> 00:19:04,176
I have no one to call.
- No one? That is pathetic.

207
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:09,077
Fuck it. This is the saddest
group of hostages that I have ever seen.

208
00:19:09,177 --> 00:19:12,835
Sit down and shut up.
- I just said that.

209
00:19:12,935 --> 00:19:15,224
I just left a message.

210
00:19:19,856 --> 00:19:23,443
As I predicted,
They have not killed us.

211
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,630
Tripp was it?

212
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:29,404
Do you want to apologize, because
You have provided us a terror?

213
00:19:29,504 --> 00:19:32,326
Why did they kill us?
- Why would they have to murder us?

214
00:19:32,426 --> 00:19:33,996
They have been convicted of a murder.
Why not...

215
00:19:34,096 --> 00:19:37,027
...all the witnesses murder?
I would do.

216
00:19:37,127 --> 00:19:39,146
Might think the robbers are
the other did it...

217
00:19:39,246 --> 00:19:43,260
...so they do not need to murder.
- It's express shot.

218
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,583
We must find out who he is
and why he killed Jack Hayes.

219
00:19:47,683 --> 00:19:50,172
How do you know his name?

220
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:54,947
Driver's license.
- You have a dead man's wallet stolen?

221
00:20:03,367 --> 00:20:06,249
Great.
Gates, you're up.

222
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:17,349
Like a gun in a brown paper bag need.

223
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,714
Tell me about it.

224
00:20:26,763 --> 00:20:30,213
Do you see a clue?
- I do not know what profession they hold.

225
00:20:30,313 --> 00:20:33,434
His business cards are credit card,
his transfer pass...

226
00:20:33,534 --> 00:20:37,784
Those are the Citibank, but
not just international.

227
00:20:37,884 --> 00:20:40,442
Why do we check him as he
has no business card?

228
00:20:40,542 --> 00:20:43,432
Maybe he has a new account opened.

229
00:20:43,524 --> 00:20:46,687
Gordon, the computers
stood by the mainframe.

230
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:49,448
Madge's money counting.

231
00:20:50,294 --> 00:20:53,903
A strict security guard at the door.
Looks at the lady...

232
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:58,135
...held by the Office of the loans is.
Kaitlin is in her area.

233
00:20:58,235 --> 00:21:01,604
And Jack Hayes was...

234
00:21:02,712 --> 00:21:07,014
Jack Hayes opened any new accounts.
He was to ogle at the desk.

235
00:21:07,114 --> 00:21:09,795
Otherwise he was to
a bank employee went.

236
00:21:09,895 --> 00:21:12,455
What was he doing here?

237
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:15,390
I have no idea.

238
00:21:38,158 --> 00:21:41,131
I feel your breath.

239
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:46,523
What are you doing?

240
00:21:46,623 --> 00:21:49,343
Hello, Tripp.
What are you doing?

241
00:21:49,401 --> 00:21:51,883
Looking for a way out.
- Did not you think they will murder us?

242
00:21:51,983 --> 00:21:55,354
I may just have your ring?
How long have you been engaged?

243
00:21:55,454 --> 00:21:58,114
That way we'll find out.
Why your wedding with Max?

244
00:21:58,214 --> 00:21:59,990
You know him do not agree.
- I know he is rich...

245
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:01,314
He can not meet your
appetite for adventure...

246
00:22:01,414 --> 00:22:02,223
...meet and your sense of humor...

247
00:22:02,323 --> 00:22:04,646
He sexually satisfy you.

248
00:22:04,746 --> 00:22:07,655
She told me that he
his pants had been found. - Madge.

249
00:22:07,755 --> 00:22:09,573
She knows him for two months,
and I have not met him yet.

250
00:22:09,673 --> 00:22:09,933
Enough.

251
00:22:10,033 --> 00:22:11,979
There are four pictures of you on that drive.

252
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:14,403
Three from Brazil. You're an adventurer.
Max is totally irrelevant.

253
00:22:14,503 --> 00:22:15,661
He was with the Banana.

254
00:22:15,761 --> 00:22:18,075
He was badly burned. He
remained in that day.

255
00:22:18,175 --> 00:22:20,564
The worst part is yours and Max for
his mansion.

256
00:22:20,664 --> 00:22:23,496
You are so small compared to that house.
He loves the house than yours there.

257
00:22:23,596 --> 00:22:26,186
Who are you?
- The most interesting thing about you is...

258
00:22:26,286 --> 00:22:28,118
...you are still working,
even though you do not need the money.

259
00:22:28,218 --> 00:22:29,624
You're an independent woman.
I like that.

260
00:22:29,724 --> 00:22:32,347
Count on that.
- If I did not use medication...

261
00:22:32,447 --> 00:22:33,597
I'm not very good with...
- People?

262
00:22:33,697 --> 00:22:36,317
Certainly not one I wants to bed.

263
00:22:36,417 --> 00:22:40,087
And then I say such things.

264
00:22:52,781 --> 00:22:54,905
Stop it.

265
00:22:55,005 --> 00:22:58,729
Because of you we are all killed.

266
00:23:00,403 --> 00:23:03,832
Be still there.

267
00:23:09,677 --> 00:23:14,158
They call me Mr. Clean.
Where are you from?

268
00:23:16,013 --> 00:23:20,428
No English.
- That I have been. To 'No English'.

269
00:23:20,915 --> 00:23:24,822
That is close to 'No problem'.

270
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:32,307
The trip.

271
00:23:35,871 --> 00:23:40,506
It can.
Come on it.

272
00:24:19,966 --> 00:24:22,324
Now we have to murder him.
- Calm down.

273
00:24:22,424 --> 00:24:24,803
Does your computer have?

274
00:24:24,903 --> 00:24:27,677
Yes, that still works.
- How much time do we lose them?

275
00:24:27,777 --> 00:24:29,777
Approximately one hour.

276
00:24:29,853 --> 00:24:32,368
Let us remember that safe
and we murder that shit.

277
00:24:32,468 --> 00:24:35,327
Then we crack ATMs.
- That is the blue color.

278
00:24:35,427 --> 00:24:38,633
This is the blue color.
- We need to do murder...

279
00:24:38,733 --> 00:24:42,473
This slows us only.
A bullet in their brains.

280
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:54,334
We have blown up the ATM?

281
00:24:54,434 --> 00:24:59,410
The biggest job you ever did.
You have just three bars...

282
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:03,590
...dynamite eaten.
- Do we have blown up the ATM?

283
00:25:03,717 --> 00:25:06,236
Let me see.

284
00:25:12,139 --> 00:25:15,284
Do you want the good or the bad news?

285
00:25:15,368 --> 00:25:19,214
The good news.
- That is, we have blown the door.

286
00:25:19,314 --> 00:25:22,629
The bad news is,
that the ATM is intact.

287
00:25:24,083 --> 00:25:26,595
Two doors.

288
00:25:28,254 --> 00:25:31,733
I have not even pulled the trigger.
That thing just went off.

289
00:25:31,833 --> 00:25:34,430
On your knees.

290
00:25:36,224 --> 00:25:38,713
Facing forward.

291
00:25:38,813 --> 00:25:40,813
Hands behind your head.

292
00:25:40,901 --> 00:25:43,067
You're going to die, so you have
no extras required.

293
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:47,417
Do you have any ideas?
- See you on the other side.

294
00:25:48,084 --> 00:25:53,296
You have to focus on the brains?
Then you have less junk or something?

295
00:25:53,396 --> 00:25:56,589
It was fun, man.

296
00:25:56,689 --> 00:26:00,674
Very nice. I had to no one else to do.

297
00:26:00,774 --> 00:26:05,396
In practical terms, this is not a good idea.
- You said we could murder him.

298
00:26:05,496 --> 00:26:08,998
Let me see the place.
- If you blowing something next time...

299
00:26:09,098 --> 00:26:11,720
...let us know.
- You got it.

300
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:15,840
I want to personally thank
that you do not murder.

301
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:19,995
Are we going to murder them?
Are you crazy?

302
00:26:23,639 --> 00:26:29,014
Why are you out of the kitchen?
- We have to murder them all.

303
00:26:32,034 --> 00:26:35,722
You have missed.

304
00:26:35,822 --> 00:26:38,146
He has to grab you?
- What?

305
00:26:38,246 --> 00:26:41,998
Your ear.
- My ear?

306
00:26:42,098 --> 00:26:45,109
I mean that.

307
00:26:47,505 --> 00:26:50,231
Get ready to die.

308
00:26:50,331 --> 00:26:52,794
Shoot him.
- I will.

309
00:26:52,894 --> 00:26:57,396
Then I will shoot you down, and this circle
violence may continue forever.

310
00:26:57,496 --> 00:26:59,855
Come on, dick.
Do it.

311
00:27:00,658 --> 00:27:02,479
You want them to shoot me.

312
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:06,395
Shoot him down.

313
00:27:07,252 --> 00:27:10,725
We are better than that.

314
00:27:11,489 --> 00:27:17,620
Then I walk back.

315
00:27:18,353 --> 00:27:22,289
Gates, bring the hostages to that office.

316
00:27:22,389 --> 00:27:24,389
Do it.

317
00:27:30,624 --> 00:27:34,631
Is it, good butter cookie?

318
00:27:48,317 --> 00:27:53,588
Why talk to a hostage against me?

319
00:27:53,688 --> 00:27:55,497
Somebody killed him,
and they will soon again a murder.

320
00:27:55,597 --> 00:27:58,607
The man with the jacket.
I was not. I was not in the right corner.

321
00:27:58,707 --> 00:28:01,838
Who had the good or corner?

322
00:28:01,938 --> 00:28:04,867
Are you Dwayne?
Pay attention to the hostages.

323
00:28:04,967 --> 00:28:07,835
Take it easy.
You're hyper.

324
00:28:07,935 --> 00:28:09,935
You need a sedative.

325
00:28:09,987 --> 00:28:15,172
What is wrong with you? I have a gun
on the back of your head.

326
00:28:15,281 --> 00:28:18,199
What were you talking about?
- They wanted to know...

327
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:20,617
...if I thought you're the man
the jacket had been murdered.

328
00:28:20,717 --> 00:28:23,118
Really?
- Yes.

329
00:28:23,218 --> 00:28:25,684
Have you done that?
- No, we're professionals.

330
00:28:25,784 --> 00:28:29,250
If one of us the guy was killed,
The hostages would be dead.

331
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:32,975
Why are there two bank robbers
killed at the same time?

332
00:28:33,075 --> 00:28:34,912
Are you kidding?
- No.

333
00:28:35,012 --> 00:28:37,963
At seven hours that computer guy
the whole security system is restarted.

334
00:28:38,063 --> 00:28:41,593
This is a new protocol. The whole
security was two minutes flat.

335
00:28:41,693 --> 00:28:43,889
That no more bank robbers
were here tonight I'm surprised.

336
00:28:43,989 --> 00:28:47,645
Darrien should know.
He knows that right?

337
00:28:48,138 --> 00:28:51,698
You tried to pry information out of me?
- Yes.

338
00:28:51,798 --> 00:28:56,570
You are Jack Hayes?
- In all my years of taking hostages...

339
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:59,645
...you're by far the most annoying.

340
00:29:00,234 --> 00:29:03,149
I'm sorry.

341
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:07,330
Go inside.

342
00:29:10,094 --> 00:29:13,972
Hello, computer man. Why you busy
but ten keys when you phoned your wife?

343
00:29:14,072 --> 00:29:16,145
What are you talking about?
- When she used the phone...

344
00:29:16,245 --> 00:29:18,166
...expressed in all ten buttons
and then connect. For eleven keys.

345
00:29:18,266 --> 00:29:21,986
You expressed only ten. I count everything.
Why do you do if your wife call you?

346
00:29:22,086 --> 00:29:25,321
You sold the information when the alarm
off was one of the criminals.

347
00:29:25,421 --> 00:29:27,064
Then you are greedy and you sold it again.

348
00:29:27,164 --> 00:29:29,795
Double money, double robbery.
Why did you not call your wife.

349
00:29:29,895 --> 00:29:33,903
Should I beat him up?
- Good practice when the police come.

350
00:29:34,003 --> 00:29:36,432
, We'll 'water boarding'.
I saw how to do it on Discovery Channel.

351
00:29:36,532 --> 00:29:41,207
I only need a mop and a pair of pliers.
- Wait a minute.

352
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:44,760
I have sold the information.
- What?

353
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:48,855
I've only done once.
And I do not even know to whom.

354
00:29:48,955 --> 00:29:51,633
I have the information faxed.
They gave me cash.

355
00:29:51,733 --> 00:29:54,885
You have to believe me.
- Why should you trust?

356
00:29:54,985 --> 00:30:00,372
No reason. But I swear I
did not want anyone injured.

357
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:05,053
And I did not kill Jack Hayes.
- Says no.

358
00:30:11,653 --> 00:30:15,881
We would already be.
- We need to break into this vault.

359
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:19,145
And I've had it.
Shut up.

360
00:30:25,825 --> 00:30:28,972
I am a genius.

361
00:30:31,095 --> 00:30:33,705
Ten left.

362
00:30:35,819 --> 00:30:38,122
It is not. According to
the vault specifications...

363
00:30:38,222 --> 00:30:39,371
...would be two inches thick.

364
00:30:39,471 --> 00:30:41,471
That is much thicker.

365
00:30:41,523 --> 00:30:44,099
How long does it take
to burn through them?

366
00:30:44,199 --> 00:30:45,703
I do not know. Two hours?

367
00:30:45,803 --> 00:30:47,663
Are all your chores so bad?

368
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:50,513
Should I worry if there is enough
gasoline in the van is?

369
00:30:50,613 --> 00:30:53,587
Look at me. We have cracked the time slot.
We need you no longer need.

370
00:30:53,687 --> 00:30:56,492
You threaten me, little bald Jew?

371
00:30:56,546 --> 00:31:02,584
Jews have more small bald for humanity
done more than anyone else. Flicker is on.

372
00:31:02,684 --> 00:31:05,813
We will not do crazy things.
Hurry.

373
00:31:05,913 --> 00:31:08,803
Hurry.

374
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:12,036
Relax.

375
00:31:14,621 --> 00:31:17,613
It never stops.
3000 years we pick that shit already.

376
00:31:17,713 --> 00:31:20,021
I know.

377
00:31:20,121 --> 00:31:22,114
I am not an accountant or
a comedy writer...

378
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:25,894
...or something very Jewish.
I am a bank robber.

379
00:31:25,994 --> 00:31:28,154
Do you know how many Jews
there are bank robbers?

380
00:31:28,254 --> 00:31:29,254
Not much.

381
00:31:29,354 --> 00:31:33,273
Not very much. Even in this environment
they see only bagels and schmear...

382
00:31:33,373 --> 00:31:35,481
...and Goldman Sachs.

383
00:31:35,581 --> 00:31:38,869
We link or by fires.
It just takes a little longer.

384
00:31:38,969 --> 00:31:41,546
I do not know, D.

385
00:31:41,646 --> 00:31:45,162
We always said we would stop
if the information is incorrect.

386
00:31:45,262 --> 00:31:47,556
That safe specifications are incorrect,
We are behind schedule...

387
00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:49,879
...and then that idiot still Lancelot.

388
00:31:49,979 --> 00:31:53,657
Hillbilly two in the hallway with weapons
play and explosives.

389
00:31:53,757 --> 00:31:59,097
They have seen our faces.
Ten years ago we were stopped.

390
00:31:59,197 --> 00:32:03,230
Ten years ago there was no recession.

391
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:07,411
In a few years we have 40.
That's 80 years in criminal.

392
00:32:07,511 --> 00:32:11,274
I'd already be inside.
I need the money more than ever.

393
00:32:11,374 --> 00:32:15,089
My little girl has just one bracket.
That Invisalign.

394
00:32:15,189 --> 00:32:18,013
Not that cheap ceramics.
9000.

395
00:32:18,113 --> 00:32:21,503
And they call us criminals.
We had to be dentist.

396
00:32:21,603 --> 00:32:25,683
We had to be dentist.
- Actually it orthodontist.

397
00:32:27,024 --> 00:32:32,846
Keep the hostages away, I start to
the link. It's us succeed.

398
00:32:33,281 --> 00:32:37,061
It always works.

399
00:32:42,604 --> 00:32:46,462
We stop the door from the C4...

400
00:32:46,562 --> 00:32:50,982
...and blowing out the door.
- Like an open beer can.

401
00:32:51,313 --> 00:32:55,890
You are the dumbest bank robbers
I have ever seen.

402
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:59,014
You have my ear 15 minutes ago shot off...

403
00:32:59,114 --> 00:33:04,299
So sorry, your comment goes one ear
and in my other out again.

404
00:33:06,259 --> 00:33:10,099
What?
- You only have one ear.

405
00:33:11,007 --> 00:33:15,595
That is a saying.
Are you doing with him?

406
00:33:16,011 --> 00:33:20,760
They can not come between us.

407
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:23,124
They're trying to lower in rank.

408
00:33:23,224 --> 00:33:29,399
You Muppets have ranks?
- Absolutely.

409
00:33:29,499 --> 00:33:33,190
We've put you down.
- Want to bet?

410
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:36,071
Go ahead.
- Come on it.

411
00:33:37,959 --> 00:33:43,307
That ranks them on the web.
- Are you still in Riverside?

412
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:46,984
We are the Internet thundered.
Has that ever happened you?

413
00:33:47,084 --> 00:33:49,028
No, I've never the Internet thundered.

414
00:33:49,128 --> 00:33:54,891
I have mixed feelings
about this whole experience.

415
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,135
You see more clues?
- No, I have to get closer.

416
00:33:58,235 --> 00:34:01,723
How do you do that?
- I work on it.

417
00:34:06,292 --> 00:34:11,440
Does it?
- Yeah, sure.

418
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:14,830
Do you have ADHD or something?
- No.

419
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:17,330
'm Not going on the defensive.
We all have stuff.

420
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:21,425
I take no coincidence Sanax.
- Why do you Sanax?

421
00:34:21,702 --> 00:34:23,845
I do not know.
Nerves before the wedding I think.

422
00:34:23,945 --> 00:34:28,469
Max is not true for you.
- Yeah, that must be it.

423
00:34:28,569 --> 00:34:30,735
What you swallow?
- What I do not swallow.

424
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:32,832
Illegal or prescription?
- All prescription.

425
00:34:32,932 --> 00:34:35,607
Illegal junk I do not trust.

426
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:39,201
Where you take it for?

427
00:34:41,622 --> 00:34:44,331
Well, then you tell me.

428
00:34:44,954 --> 00:34:47,475
It turns the TV off.
- Interesting.

429
00:34:47,575 --> 00:34:50,099
Would you tell?
- How do I explain that?

430
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:53,392
I've seen hundreds of doctors.
They have hundreds of diagnoses.

431
00:34:53,492 --> 00:34:57,117
Not that I'm crazy,
but it's like...

432
00:34:59,266 --> 00:35:02,531
There are a lot of TVs and they are
All other station...

433
00:35:02,631 --> 00:35:04,720
...a normal person...

434
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:07,909
...concentrate on one, I take it
all at once to me.

435
00:35:08,009 --> 00:35:10,679
Can you expand?
- No.

436
00:35:10,779 --> 00:35:14,266
I wish I could.
I've tried everything.

437
00:35:17,279 --> 00:35:19,751
Switch channels?
- No.

438
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:22,568
Tricky.
- Yes.

439
00:35:22,668 --> 00:35:23,668
You know what they say.

440
00:35:23,768 --> 00:35:25,769
Normal but the kitchen
sink and washing machine.

441
00:35:25,869 --> 00:35:29,133
A fool would say,
not a normal person.

442
00:35:34,563 --> 00:35:38,236
This is the list of the FBI for
most wanted bank robbers.

443
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:41,642
Number one, Vicellous Drum.
He's overrated.

444
00:35:41,742 --> 00:35:44,881
I do not know.
He was never caught.

445
00:35:44,981 --> 00:35:46,926
The most stolen.
The largest ratio.

446
00:35:47,026 --> 00:35:51,938
Jobs are running smoothly.
Like fat people who run to the buffet.

447
00:35:52,038 --> 00:35:56,704
Look at the Baltimore job.
20 people dead. That's pretty excessive.

448
00:35:56,804 --> 00:35:59,694
He takes it into millions.

449
00:35:59,794 --> 00:36:04,414
Number two is Mick Nylon and his gang.
Number three, Alexis Black.

450
00:36:04,514 --> 00:36:07,985
She is good for a girl.
And Darrien and Weinstein at 12.

451
00:36:08,085 --> 00:36:10,429
They have been doing it 15 years.

452
00:36:10,529 --> 00:36:13,526
They have much more
recognition than I am.

453
00:36:13,626 --> 00:36:16,813
I am.
68 place as a bank robber.

454
00:36:16,913 --> 00:36:20,413
But if four cyber criminal.

455
00:36:20,513 --> 00:36:24,266
Now I can say...

456
00:36:24,366 --> 00:36:28,948
My ear is shot off
the fourth cyber criminals in the country.

457
00:36:29,048 --> 00:36:32,150
Will you be shooting my finger?

458
00:36:33,017 --> 00:36:36,192
Hit me just now?

459
00:36:36,292 --> 00:36:39,484
Where are we?

460
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:45,014
Number 674?

461
00:36:45,114 --> 00:36:47,527
They have probably...

462
00:36:47,627 --> 00:36:49,266
Excluding the international job.

463
00:36:49,366 --> 00:36:52,061
We had a Kwik-Fit robberies in Winnipeg.

464
00:36:52,161 --> 00:36:55,451
Who is here.
You have been arrested in Sagamore...

465
00:36:55,551 --> 00:36:56,858
...when your car broke down.

466
00:36:56,958 --> 00:37:01,215
We had blown the engine.
- Once you have raided a Kwik-Fit?

467
00:37:01,315 --> 00:37:03,950
So ironic it's not for us.

468
00:37:06,964 --> 00:37:11,554
I have broken their chains.
They're going to murder me.

469
00:37:13,223 --> 00:37:16,122
You can still state witness,
then enter the prison.

470
00:37:16,222 --> 00:37:18,315
Should I feel better?

471
00:37:18,415 --> 00:37:22,665
The tank is not so bad.
There are not many gay men.

472
00:37:24,116 --> 00:37:27,176
For you maybe.
You do look delicious.

473
00:37:29,045 --> 00:37:32,470
Disgusting.
Come and help.

474
00:37:36,228 --> 00:37:40,563
They have already learned that you
the detector are?

475
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:44,711
Come on.

476
00:37:44,811 --> 00:37:49,094
Come on.
Get out.

477
00:37:54,088 --> 00:37:57,728
Gates, you rule the toilet breaks even.
I gotta give this guy some Rennies.

478
00:37:57,828 --> 00:38:01,650
Sorry, guys.
See you later.

479
00:38:22,447 --> 00:38:27,229
We put the things on edge.
Tonight it will happen.

480
00:38:37,496 --> 00:38:40,555
You need the latest bloated.

481
00:38:40,655 --> 00:38:45,274
You have also taken one for the team,
with your ears and stuff.

482
00:38:45,374 --> 00:38:49,230
I have an idea.

483
00:38:50,109 --> 00:38:52,870
Can we borrow one of the hostages?

484
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:57,305
Half of us anyway.
- You want to choose?

485
00:38:59,899 --> 00:39:03,096
All.

486
00:39:04,047 --> 00:39:08,017
I take that beauty.
- They are all beautiful.

487
00:39:08,117 --> 00:39:13,721
I take that cue and mustache Remans.

488
00:39:13,821 --> 00:39:18,496
That black chick, that creep,
gay and who goes with you.

489
00:39:19,116 --> 00:39:21,115
What?
- I must go to the bathroom.

490
00:39:21,215 --> 00:39:23,899
Should you piss again?

491
00:39:23,999 --> 00:39:26,784
Is there something
wrong with your pecker?

492
00:39:26,884 --> 00:39:28,724
I have some kind of problem.

493
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:31,115
Then go ahead.

494
00:39:36,343 --> 00:39:39,825
In connection with the
team spirit we welcome...

495
00:39:39,925 --> 00:39:41,126
Mystic Lightning.

496
00:39:41,226 --> 00:39:43,757
Not Mystic Lightning.
I hate that name.

497
00:39:43,857 --> 00:39:48,655
'Ties' is cool? Who are blind tunnel.
Rodents living on garbage and excrement.

498
00:39:48,755 --> 00:39:50,617
These are not inspiring animals.

499
00:39:50,717 --> 00:39:54,618
You should choose Peanut Butter and Jelly.
I choose this.

500
00:39:54,718 --> 00:39:56,718
Well.

501
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:59,145
For our first activity...

502
00:39:59,245 --> 00:40:01,838
We need a very special tie...

503
00:40:01,938 --> 00:40:04,132
...that, if possible, can read Chinese.

504
00:40:04,232 --> 00:40:07,993
For some totally harmless explosives
for us to explode.

505
00:40:08,093 --> 00:40:11,268
So if you ask, we get not volunteer.

506
00:40:11,368 --> 00:40:13,371
What?
- I can see Jack Hayes.

507
00:40:13,471 --> 00:40:15,595
See?

508
00:40:15,695 --> 00:40:18,942
He's dead. You can do nothing for him.
- You love me.

509
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:22,625
I'm not crazy about you.
- I have heard no gunshot.

510
00:40:22,725 --> 00:40:27,136
How will Max react to this?
You mutilate yourself. I do not care.

511
00:40:27,236 --> 00:40:29,236
Get out.

512
00:40:31,922 --> 00:40:35,067
I'm not gay.
- Now is the time for it.

513
00:40:46,116 --> 00:40:48,548
This must happen.

514
00:40:48,648 --> 00:40:50,783
You put the primer in the C4.

515
00:40:50,883 --> 00:40:53,195
You run to a safe place...

516
00:40:53,295 --> 00:40:55,848
...and I push in the igniter.

517
00:40:55,948 --> 00:40:57,747
This is really happening.

518
00:40:57,847 --> 00:41:01,162
Igniter in the C4.
A gigantic explosion.

519
00:41:01,224 --> 00:41:06,834
You will be thrown by the bank,
and we find you than in the rubble.

520
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:10,918
Success.

521
00:41:16,007 --> 00:41:19,026
Go ahead.

522
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:27,123
He is not the smartest.
- No.

523
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:15,373
New rules now we only rob people.

524
00:42:15,473 --> 00:42:18,220
This is absurd.

525
00:42:29,622 --> 00:42:33,452
Of course they are locked.

526
00:42:33,552 --> 00:42:37,248
Why this man hates us?

527
00:42:39,209 --> 00:42:42,258
I found a few pennies.

528
00:42:42,358 --> 00:42:45,573
Pennies.
The dumbest currency on the planet.

529
00:42:45,673 --> 00:42:50,383
It looks a bit better.
I just found some pennies.

530
00:42:51,553 --> 00:42:54,945
That way.

531
00:42:55,885 --> 00:42:58,058
Drop the gun.

532
00:42:58,158 --> 00:43:02,270
You heard him. Drop it.
- Put the gun down.

533
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:05,967
Put that gun down.

534
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:08,914
Put it down.

535
00:43:11,545 --> 00:43:15,082
Drop the gun.

536
00:43:17,542 --> 00:43:20,657
Now let the gun fall.
- What is it?

537
00:43:20,757 --> 00:43:25,417
Drop the gun.
- It? Who was with him.

538
00:43:25,517 --> 00:43:29,378
The origin of the gun I'm not interested.

539
00:43:29,478 --> 00:43:32,056
Put it on the ground.

540
00:43:36,058 --> 00:43:37,525
You're kidding.

541
00:43:37,625 --> 00:43:42,168
We are the youngest team here...

542
00:43:42,268 --> 00:43:46,904
We want you to your guns
us, if we focus on your gun.

543
00:43:47,673 --> 00:43:53,263
This is an FBI gun?
- FBI? That's interesting.

544
00:43:54,302 --> 00:43:58,015
FBI agent tried this bank also to rob?

545
00:43:59,129 --> 00:44:00,554
Or someone he studied?

546
00:44:00,654 --> 00:44:02,743
There are at least five...

547
00:44:02,843 --> 00:44:06,753
...wanted criminals. -
What is happening here?

548
00:44:07,493 --> 00:44:10,037
Got it?
- No.

549
00:44:10,663 --> 00:44:14,412
I have that missing piece found in your ear.

550
00:44:14,512 --> 00:44:15,907
If anything you, I care for you.

551
00:44:16,007 --> 00:44:18,979
Peanut Butter and Jelly were
to the front door.

552
00:44:19,079 --> 00:44:21,766
Darrien and Gates came down the stairs.
Bullets flew from north to south.

553
00:44:21,866 --> 00:44:23,726
Blood splattered from east to west.
We were stuck in the crossfire.

554
00:44:23,826 --> 00:44:26,516
North, south.

555
00:44:26,616 --> 00:44:28,982
Darrien and Gates took the wrong exit.

556
00:44:29,082 --> 00:44:31,531
Peanut Butter and Jelly too.

557
00:44:32,729 --> 00:44:35,278
The FBI came, Jack Hayes was the pipe.

558
00:44:35,378 --> 00:44:38,967
Only two people had it so
shoot. Mitchell, the computer guy.

559
00:44:39,067 --> 00:44:42,397
He was unarmed.
If you omit this option...

560
00:44:42,497 --> 00:44:44,658
...there is only one other possibility.

561
00:44:44,758 --> 00:44:47,617
The killer must...

562
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:52,664
Be Weinstein.

563
00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:03,782
Weinstein? Are you sure?
- Yes.

564
00:45:03,882 --> 00:45:06,767
What is your source?

565
00:45:21,070 --> 00:45:23,556
They each shot.

566
00:45:23,656 --> 00:45:28,664
No, he can not be faster than Weinstein.

567
00:45:28,764 --> 00:45:30,923
Where does he get a gun and
a silencer from?

568
00:45:31,023 --> 00:45:34,490
Weinstein was furious
because the computer guy...

569
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:35,975
...two parties invited.

570
00:45:36,075 --> 00:45:38,867
And that computer guy is furious because
Weinstein that FBI guy killed.

571
00:45:38,967 --> 00:45:41,993
They confront each other, pulling
their guns and go both dead.

572
00:45:42,093 --> 00:45:44,015
Why Weinstein confront him?

573
00:45:44,115 --> 00:45:47,828
Why would an FBI guy Weinstein
murder in the middle of a bank robbery?

574
00:45:47,928 --> 00:45:53,090
That asshole surprise.
- The computer guy has two bullets in it.

575
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:55,719
Maybe someone, someone else
surprise in a different way.

576
00:45:55,819 --> 00:45:58,391
If it was not a confrontation,
if they were friends?

577
00:45:58,491 --> 00:46:02,656
Watch what you say,
when you talk about my friend.

578
00:46:02,736 --> 00:46:05,098
He would never betray me.

579
00:46:05,198 --> 00:46:09,578
We have been together 15 years.
That means something in this kind of work.

580
00:46:09,678 --> 00:46:16,138
There people had access to the kitchen,
Peanut Butter and Jelly where only...

581
00:46:16,658 --> 00:46:22,607
...and you, Gates had access to the kitchen.
- And the hostages up in the attic.

582
00:46:22,707 --> 00:46:27,176
Crawling up the hostages
are now in the attic around?

583
00:46:27,276 --> 00:46:28,676
This job is over.

584
00:46:28,776 --> 00:46:31,861
Wait here.
Darrien, listen.

585
00:46:48,869 --> 00:46:51,503
That's odd.

586
00:47:00,137 --> 00:47:03,439
What do we do now?

587
00:47:03,539 --> 00:47:08,683
I have nothing.
I'm just this piece of ear...

588
00:47:08,783 --> 00:47:14,528
...in the freezer.
- I swear...

589
00:47:14,628 --> 00:47:17,763
...if you're a woman,
I would marry you.

590
00:47:17,863 --> 00:47:21,560
I am not.

591
00:47:28,936 --> 00:47:32,718
You go with me down.

592
00:47:32,818 --> 00:47:35,914
Where's the remote?
We need them to get out of this.

593
00:47:36,014 --> 00:47:39,244
A few more corpses.
We change the plan.

594
00:47:39,338 --> 00:47:43,883
Therefore let this job go.
- You know what they say about plans?

595
00:47:43,983 --> 00:47:47,538
If you want God to laugh,
tell him all about your plans.

596
00:47:47,638 --> 00:47:51,803
Believe me, who is himself
there are broken laugh.

597
00:47:51,878 --> 00:47:56,840
Nothing in this rotten bank
goes according to plan.

598
00:47:56,940 --> 00:48:00,006
Where's the remote?
- Weinstein him.

599
00:48:00,106 --> 00:48:02,242
What has he left?
- I do not know.

600
00:48:02,342 --> 00:48:05,160
Take it easy and listen to me.

601
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:07,332
We had to go away long ago.

602
00:48:07,432 --> 00:48:10,495
It's over. - We have
needed to break the link.

603
00:48:10,595 --> 00:48:11,908
I need to get away.

604
00:48:12,008 --> 00:48:16,362
I want to stay here and rob that bank.
- The bank job is fucked up.

605
00:48:16,462 --> 00:48:21,020
You and me on a desert island,
drinking, lots of chicks...

606
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:24,919
Think about it.

607
00:48:26,964 --> 00:48:31,126
The boat is gone, only
the engine is still there.

608
00:48:31,226 --> 00:48:37,126
This affects your common sense.

609
00:48:37,226 --> 00:48:39,467
I thought you had balls.

610
00:48:39,567 --> 00:48:43,052
You're a disgrace to the black criminals.

611
00:49:02,805 --> 00:49:05,861
Tonight was a fucking mess.
But not anymore.

612
00:49:05,961 --> 00:49:11,190
There's only one gang robbers.
Three of us.

613
00:49:11,290 --> 00:49:15,285
Mystic Lightning Can we be?
- No, you're Muppet.

614
00:49:17,193 --> 00:49:20,881
No excuse, no more favors,
no gentle treatment.

615
00:49:20,981 --> 00:49:23,873
It is now for real.

616
00:49:25,789 --> 00:49:30,740
Because there is only one army,
There is even a general.

617
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:34,387
I am the General.

618
00:49:35,521 --> 00:49:40,572
I have complete control.
Nothing happens without my say so.

619
00:49:48,937 --> 00:49:54,479
Come on.
What is your cross?

620
00:50:00,266 --> 00:50:03,216
Bring the hostages out of the office.

621
00:50:03,316 --> 00:50:07,482
Hurry.
- You heard him.

622
00:50:07,582 --> 00:50:11,058
The stairs.

623
00:50:11,158 --> 00:50:13,139
Do you have thermal lance disabled?

624
00:50:13,239 --> 00:50:17,335
You do not appear?
- No.

625
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:22,027
What's next?
We begin with the vault...

626
00:50:22,127 --> 00:50:27,966
...or murder us all hostages?
- Definitely the vault.

627
00:50:28,066 --> 00:50:30,633
Hostages may be useful.

628
00:50:30,733 --> 00:50:33,492
You can use them as human shields...

629
00:50:33,592 --> 00:50:39,117
...things they can get you.
As the money from the bank. Or snacks.

630
00:50:39,423 --> 00:50:42,993
We start with the safe.
On one condition...

631
00:50:43,075 --> 00:50:47,102
...if the time has come to do it,
I do it alone.

632
00:50:49,015 --> 00:50:54,285
That should not be a problem.
We are not like the mass murders.

633
00:50:54,346 --> 00:50:58,396
If you are in being so,
is not a problem for us.

634
00:50:59,289 --> 00:51:01,773
Come on then.

635
00:51:02,543 --> 00:51:04,961
Back to work then.

636
00:51:12,604 --> 00:51:15,519
Does it?
- Excellent.

637
00:51:15,619 --> 00:51:17,558
This is so much better than first class
flying, drinking champagne and...

638
00:51:17,658 --> 00:51:18,606
...and go to my wedding.

639
00:51:18,706 --> 00:51:20,568
If you can walk out the
bank with the money...

640
00:51:20,668 --> 00:51:25,148
Max would you still need?
- You must let go.

641
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:27,430
I can not let go.
I'm obsessive.

642
00:51:27,530 --> 00:51:30,499
If you had the money,
Max would still be?

643
00:51:30,599 --> 00:51:33,782
He holds the door open for you?
He hugs you at night?

644
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:36,008
I do not like to cuddle? - Is he
the weekend to Mom and Dad?

645
00:51:36,108 --> 00:51:37,698
My mother loves him. - Everyone...

646
00:51:37,798 --> 00:51:39,774
...says you can not buy
happiness with money.

647
00:51:39,874 --> 00:51:41,342
Nobody really believes that.

648
00:51:41,442 --> 00:51:45,705
Your tenacity is touching.
As I exit I go back to Max.

649
00:51:45,805 --> 00:51:50,310
I continue with this for five hours.
- No, I'm saying.

650
00:51:53,055 --> 00:51:58,156
The thermal lance is blown,
so we use the c4 for the link.

651
00:51:58,256 --> 00:52:00,367
We are all to the controlled explosion.

652
00:52:00,467 --> 00:52:03,164
That would be something different.

653
00:52:03,264 --> 00:52:06,344
I want you to know that I am
not use your explosives.

654
00:52:06,444 --> 00:52:08,444
We know.

655
00:52:13,946 --> 00:52:16,956
Go look at it.

656
00:52:17,696 --> 00:52:23,425
No unexpected things,
No dynamite...

657
00:52:23,525 --> 00:52:26,926
...or apache helicopters
and no nuclear weapons.

658
00:52:27,026 --> 00:52:28,054
Now go and see.

659
00:52:28,154 --> 00:52:31,024
Whoever it is, shoot them.

660
00:52:35,722 --> 00:52:37,967
Why he always throws scissors?

661
00:52:38,067 --> 00:52:42,201
Why, Jelly.
Why?

662
00:52:42,301 --> 00:52:45,616
Do not throw scissors, but with stones.

663
00:53:03,538 --> 00:53:06,628
Is there anyone?

664
00:53:16,247 --> 00:53:20,327
I know you're there.
I will not shoot you, Tripp.

665
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:27,555
I just want the bank but robberies.

666
00:53:28,233 --> 00:53:32,619
I do not know what happens.
- With the raid?

667
00:53:32,719 --> 00:53:36,806
Yes, with the raid and everything.

668
00:53:36,906 --> 00:53:39,358
I would now be the happiest guy
world should be.

669
00:53:39,458 --> 00:53:43,903
I have a great job, working with
my best friend. The hours are ideal.

670
00:53:44,003 --> 00:53:46,158
We have never been on people
having to shoot.

671
00:53:46,258 --> 00:53:49,573
We've never seen anyone need to murder.

672
00:53:52,558 --> 00:53:55,150
Can you come out?

673
00:53:55,662 --> 00:53:59,284
It's strange to all those things against
a photocopier to say.

674
00:53:59,384 --> 00:54:02,651
I will not be negative.

675
00:54:03,317 --> 00:54:05,688
I'm just saying...

676
00:54:05,788 --> 00:54:10,014
Maybe I'm not good at bank clerk.

677
00:54:10,114 --> 00:54:13,766
Perhaps Jesus has me here
not put on earth.

678
00:54:13,866 --> 00:54:16,882
My grandfather sold illegal liquor.

679
00:54:16,982 --> 00:54:19,753
My father was a sex offender.

680
00:54:19,853 --> 00:54:22,794
Criminals is in my blood.

681
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:27,046
Between you and me, it
was always my dream...

682
00:54:27,146 --> 00:54:29,866
...been to work at a water park.

683
00:54:29,924 --> 00:54:32,183
I hear you.

684
00:54:32,772 --> 00:54:36,075
For what it's worth, I find
a great bank robber.

685
00:54:36,175 --> 00:54:37,985
Are you serious?

686
00:54:38,085 --> 00:54:41,308
You say no, because I have a gun
I focused on your dick?

687
00:54:41,408 --> 00:54:44,638
Nothing that went wrong is your fault.

688
00:54:44,982 --> 00:54:48,977
You are sabotaged.
Take it easy.

689
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:51,117
I let you see something.

690
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:55,049
Where did you get that?

691
00:54:55,149 --> 00:54:57,402
Which I took from your suitcase stolen.

692
00:54:57,502 --> 00:55:02,177
Look, even if each transmitter
suffer from interference.

693
00:55:02,365 --> 00:55:06,140
The ignition should work.

694
00:55:06,841 --> 00:55:09,438
No.
Who has changed?

695
00:55:09,538 --> 00:55:12,193
Leader, are you okay?
- Who is your leader?

696
00:55:12,293 --> 00:55:15,251
I must not tell you.
- Who has it changed, to murder you.

697
00:55:15,351 --> 00:55:21,011
It's like leader,
or Peanut Butter.

698
00:55:22,209 --> 00:55:25,874
Peanut Butter is a brother to me.

699
00:55:27,887 --> 00:55:31,431
Peanut Butter and I are like best
gay friends in a bathtub.

700
00:55:31,531 --> 00:55:34,107
We are so close.

701
00:55:35,054 --> 00:55:40,239
A lot of money in the bank.
You need it from different angles.

702
00:55:41,954 --> 00:55:46,672
He knew from the freezer, even though
we not been in that kitchen.

703
00:55:46,772 --> 00:55:49,643
Let me tackle it was in the kitchen.

704
00:55:49,743 --> 00:55:54,350
Who is your leader?
You can trust me.

705
00:55:54,464 --> 00:55:57,186
Who is your leader?

706
00:55:58,847 --> 00:56:01,933
Here.
Take a look.

707
00:56:02,441 --> 00:56:05,974
Vicellous Drum.
We have never met him.

708
00:56:06,074 --> 00:56:10,899
The text is clear, the information is correct.
Never has our face. Just a fax.

709
00:56:10,999 --> 00:56:14,960
Is that normal? Receive a fax?
- You thought surely emails?

710
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:18,140
The police pull these things after.

711
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:21,164
They store about anti-fax technology.

712
00:56:21,264 --> 00:56:25,911
Everyone loves the comedians
the hard copy.

713
00:56:27,656 --> 00:56:29,113
I do not want to scare you.

714
00:56:29,213 --> 00:56:33,718
Do you think there is something
the conspiracy theory?

715
00:56:34,255 --> 00:56:39,317
I want to wipe out anyone's character...

716
00:56:39,417 --> 00:56:44,047
I have Rex as he caught the vault
the measure was.

717
00:56:44,147 --> 00:56:45,876
I asked what he was doing,
and then he said...

718
00:56:45,976 --> 00:56:48,893
...that he was watching and lots of space
was for the new foreign currency.

719
00:56:48,993 --> 00:56:53,073
What weird.
He would know if the system was flat.

720
00:56:53,585 --> 00:56:56,436
He would have known.

721
00:56:56,536 --> 00:57:01,333
He has repeatedly told us that he
an expert in the bank robbery procedures.

722
00:57:01,433 --> 00:57:05,194
You're right.
- It's so crazy.

723
00:57:05,294 --> 00:57:07,682
That is so.

724
00:57:11,830 --> 00:57:14,975
Has anyone seen my insulin injection?

725
00:57:17,211 --> 00:57:20,826
Grab a chair.

726
00:57:20,926 --> 00:57:24,446
Does anyone have sugar?
- I do not candy.

727
00:57:25,070 --> 00:57:27,070
Hold his head.

728
00:57:27,678 --> 00:57:30,656
Fire.

729
00:57:30,916 --> 00:57:32,586
Fire.

730
00:57:32,686 --> 00:57:34,686
Where?
- The man...

731
00:57:34,773 --> 00:57:39,402
Glucose is necessary or he dies
and I get it anyway. Come on.

732
00:57:39,502 --> 00:57:40,931
All right.

733
00:57:41,031 --> 00:57:43,031
Where's the fire?

734
00:57:43,449 --> 00:57:45,941
You often work with Vicellous Drum guy?
- Yes.

735
00:57:46,041 --> 00:57:47,599
We were once decoys for 'm.

736
00:57:47,699 --> 00:57:51,751
We had from him a bench robbery
while he 's safe in the big city did.

737
00:57:51,851 --> 00:57:58,873
It was unfortunate that no money was,
out of 80 Canadian dollars.

738
00:57:58,973 --> 00:58:04,073
Mr. Blythe's got low sugar.
We should seek immediate glucose.

739
00:58:09,991 --> 00:58:11,991
Where's my gun?

740
00:58:15,988 --> 00:58:20,617
Look over the edge.
As we crossed into the cell.

741
00:58:20,717 --> 00:58:24,041
Wait, have you ever been?
And you monitor his bank?

742
00:58:24,141 --> 00:58:27,083
Yes, I have some omission on my resume.

743
00:58:27,183 --> 00:58:29,446
What have you been?
- Bank Heist.

744
00:58:29,546 --> 00:58:31,907
And other offenses.

745
00:58:32,007 --> 00:58:34,380
I have often done to mail fraud.

746
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:37,198
They were not big banks.
- How much?

747
00:58:37,298 --> 00:58:39,831
A few. Twelve.
- My God.

748
00:58:39,931 --> 00:58:41,507
Take it easy.

749
00:58:41,607 --> 00:58:44,407
I am rehabilitated and stuff.

750
00:58:44,507 --> 00:58:46,507
Are you single?

751
00:58:49,363 --> 00:58:51,363
I think it is.

752
00:59:06,425 --> 00:59:08,835
He must wake up normally, right?

753
00:59:08,935 --> 00:59:10,569
He starts to open his eyes.

754
00:59:10,669 --> 00:59:12,669
He's a tough old man.

755
00:59:13,470 --> 00:59:15,595
Would you sit up?
- Ready?

756
00:59:17,665 --> 00:59:21,320
I close the doors for the last time. Clear?

757
00:59:21,638 --> 00:59:26,321
Is that clear, assholes?

758
00:59:26,421 --> 00:59:29,162
I do not like that word.
- What did you just say?

759
00:59:29,262 --> 00:59:30,441
I hate the K-word.

760
00:59:30,541 --> 00:59:35,436
Say that again and I cut you...
- I said I hate the K-word...

761
00:59:35,536 --> 00:59:37,968
...and use in America we never.

762
00:59:38,068 --> 00:59:40,092
The Australians are damn.

763
00:59:40,192 --> 00:59:44,860
He has the same gun as you.
- That's my weapon.

764
00:59:46,967 --> 00:59:50,013
This is what you need fixed?
- What is the hell?

765
00:59:50,113 --> 00:59:52,137
That is our way.

766
00:59:52,237 --> 00:59:54,887
What do you want? Part?
- We talk outside.

767
00:59:54,987 --> 00:59:58,283
Hands behind your head.

768
00:59:58,383 --> 01:00:00,175
Out.

769
01:00:00,275 --> 01:00:02,683
Calmly.
- Maniac.

770
01:00:02,783 --> 01:00:04,606
You've made your point.
- Why?

771
01:00:04,706 --> 01:00:08,070
Unless you have something to be
negotiate, say.

772
01:00:08,170 --> 01:00:10,949
Weinstein was our informant.
I have never met our leader.

773
01:00:11,049 --> 01:00:12,535
How have you contacted?
- That I will not say.

774
01:00:12,635 --> 01:00:15,973
Would you leave?
Answer to my question.

775
01:00:16,073 --> 01:00:20,021
Look, we have only this fax.

776
01:00:20,121 --> 01:00:22,834
I switch on the remote.

777
01:00:22,934 --> 01:00:25,255
Calmly.
- Get up.

778
01:00:25,355 --> 01:00:27,355
Give me the remote.

779
01:00:29,415 --> 01:00:33,083
Now give me the damn gun.
- It's Jelly his weapon.

780
01:00:33,183 --> 01:00:35,183
It was from his mother.

781
01:00:36,830 --> 01:00:38,793
Is it 's weapon of your mother?

782
01:00:38,893 --> 01:00:40,893
I give it to you.

783
01:00:41,631 --> 01:00:43,631
I'm sorry.

784
01:00:45,583 --> 01:00:48,701
You lose that damn gun now?
- No.

785
01:00:48,801 --> 01:00:53,136
Are you fucking crazy?
You lose your gun privileges.

786
01:00:53,348 --> 01:00:55,348
Forwards.

787
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:59,298
Jesus. And you.
I do not want to hear from you.

788
01:00:59,398 --> 01:01:02,117
One word, and you're dead.

789
01:01:02,217 --> 01:01:04,740
Go back.
- Thanks.

790
01:01:07,527 --> 01:01:09,020
Back to work.

791
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:11,255
My god.
- What was that about?

792
01:01:11,355 --> 01:01:14,347
I like the remote exchanged with this fax.

793
01:01:14,447 --> 01:01:16,006
And that 's good deal?
- No idea.

794
01:01:16,106 --> 01:01:18,747
That's why I kept the battery with me.

795
01:01:18,847 --> 01:01:22,456
Mr. Blythe told me he saw Rex
the vault of the measurement was.

796
01:01:22,556 --> 01:01:24,723
I have seen.

797
01:01:25,114 --> 01:01:27,410
Where is the Swiss girl?

798
01:01:27,649 --> 01:01:31,217
The Swiss maid is not there.
- It happens.

799
01:01:31,317 --> 01:01:33,025
What then?

800
01:01:33,125 --> 01:01:37,455
Faxes, the night vision?
- What are you talking about?

801
01:01:37,555 --> 01:01:40,092
Five, six...
- Stop counting.

802
01:01:40,192 --> 01:01:43,363
Tripp, stop.

803
01:01:47,332 --> 01:01:48,649
What?
- Why did you do that?

804
01:01:48,749 --> 01:01:51,879
Because you might as bright...
- No, it does not work.

805
01:01:51,979 --> 01:01:55,783
For God's sake.
- I think of a thousand things.

806
01:01:55,883 --> 01:01:58,275
And now I have the kiss
think. Are you serious?

807
01:01:58,375 --> 01:02:01,757
My God. My brain will explode.

808
01:02:11,545 --> 01:02:14,265
He's crazy, but has talent.

809
01:02:14,365 --> 01:02:18,332
Indeed, he is a criminal genius.

810
01:02:18,722 --> 01:02:22,347
We are blessed.
- Can we help?

811
01:02:23,848 --> 01:02:26,801
A soft drink without sugar?

812
01:02:27,057 --> 01:02:30,182
Go somewhere else.

813
01:02:39,253 --> 01:02:42,614
One more hour.
We will make it.

814
01:02:43,266 --> 01:02:45,660
The only people murdered
criminals are provisional.

815
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:48,347
They can kill themselves.

816
01:02:48,818 --> 01:02:51,974
We are heroic survivors,
as I call it.

817
01:02:52,975 --> 01:02:57,769
Starting tomorrow, everyone
one week vacation.

818
01:02:58,807 --> 01:03:03,482
I have next week Fri
- Then we'll have 'a week business.

819
01:03:06,321 --> 01:03:10,742
We're not safe.
- You want me just do not agree.

820
01:03:11,489 --> 01:03:13,489
No.

821
01:03:18,154 --> 01:03:20,269
What's in her bra?
- I take it well.

822
01:03:20,369 --> 01:03:22,369
Wait.

823
01:03:23,084 --> 01:03:25,379
Do it.
- This is disgusting.

824
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:30,148
Forward, pull it out.

825
01:03:34,052 --> 01:03:36,326
She works in a Swiss bank?

826
01:03:40,899 --> 01:03:43,388
What a waste.

827
01:03:43,488 --> 01:03:46,626
It is especially sad like a nice girl dies.

828
01:03:46,726 --> 01:03:51,743
If an ugly girl dies
was their life sucks anyway.

829
01:03:51,843 --> 01:03:55,197
But if a nice girl dies is it really 's tragedy.

830
01:03:55,297 --> 01:03:59,605
Indeed. Nice girls are
unicorns and gnomes.

831
01:03:59,705 --> 01:04:03,190
Rare and valuable.
They must be protected.

832
01:04:03,580 --> 01:04:06,249
My god.
- What?

833
01:04:06,717 --> 01:04:09,012
This is not a bank robbery.

834
01:04:22,779 --> 01:04:26,141
This is not a bank robbery.

835
01:04:26,241 --> 01:04:27,998
You're fucking dead.

836
01:04:28,098 --> 01:04:31,972
Hakuna Matata, asshole.

837
01:04:33,815 --> 01:04:37,226
Listen, and I give you back primer.

838
01:04:37,637 --> 01:04:39,079
Well.

839
01:04:39,179 --> 01:04:42,158
These are the two faxes to you
these bank robberies.

840
01:04:42,258 --> 01:04:45,079
This is the fax to the Swiss girl.
They are different...

841
01:04:45,179 --> 01:04:47,292
...except that they are each 81 mm
have a blank line.

842
01:04:47,392 --> 01:04:50,126
The printer had a scratch.
- I do not understand.

843
01:04:50,226 --> 01:04:52,490
Neither do I.
- Printed by the same device?

844
01:04:52,590 --> 01:04:56,024
By the same person.
- Who?

845
01:04:56,124 --> 01:04:58,122
Vicellous Drum.
- Who is that?

846
01:04:58,222 --> 01:05:03,067
The number one criminal mastermind.
Those clever bastards.

847
01:05:03,132 --> 01:05:05,676
This is an organized trap.

848
01:05:06,008 --> 01:05:07,609
Vicellous Drum has a problem.

849
01:05:07,709 --> 01:05:09,686
He goes' n lots of people killed
associated with him are...

850
01:05:09,786 --> 01:05:11,411
...but it may not seem that he is behind it.

851
01:05:11,511 --> 01:05:16,335
Each of us is connected with the criminal?

852
01:05:16,435 --> 01:05:18,435
Yes. Let me explain.

853
01:05:18,514 --> 01:05:21,842
If this is true, the FBI agent searches
Drum for years.

854
01:05:21,942 --> 01:05:23,779
Darrien and Weinstein have already
previously worked for Drum.

855
01:05:23,879 --> 01:05:26,660
The Swiss bank representative
Drum money laundering.

856
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:28,514
Mitchell Woolf is his Drum
computer hacker.

857
01:05:28,614 --> 01:05:31,128
Peanut Butter and Jelly
have him working as decoys.

858
01:05:31,228 --> 01:05:34,009
They may be able to reveal all.
And all the rest, who knows...

859
01:05:34,109 --> 01:05:37,098
Perhaps Mr. Blythe met Drum
alone, making him angry.

860
01:05:37,198 --> 01:05:42,444
He was offended. Maybe flirt Mr Clean
with him in a prison shower.

861
01:05:42,544 --> 01:05:44,340
A blowjob in prison he does not survive.

862
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:46,062
Perhaps we are here by mistake.

863
01:05:46,162 --> 01:05:49,299
Collateral damage.
- You're kidding.

864
01:05:49,399 --> 01:05:53,802
Hoping that we kill each other?
This is sloppy, especially for Drum.

865
01:05:53,902 --> 01:05:56,301
That's why he is here, personally.

866
01:05:56,401 --> 01:05:59,197
Come on.
- Think about it. The thermal lance.

867
01:05:59,297 --> 01:06:03,475
The explosives went off at the exact time.

868
01:06:03,748 --> 01:06:06,077
The FBI agent was the largest Drum threat.

869
01:06:06,177 --> 01:06:08,982
He left Weinstein him first kill.

870
01:06:09,928 --> 01:06:13,316
Yes, Weinstein worked for Drum
from the beginning.

871
01:06:13,416 --> 01:06:15,717
Like Mitchell, who knew ceded as security.

872
01:06:15,817 --> 01:06:18,027
Drum and then killed them.

873
01:06:22,787 --> 01:06:24,822
Drum had the best possible
in a double murder seems...

874
01:06:24,922 --> 01:06:29,144
...but the remote Weinstein
his mouth was very suspicious.

875
01:06:29,244 --> 01:06:32,147
I guess Weinstein him in
his mouth was blocked...

876
01:06:32,247 --> 01:06:35,223
...to avoid the real killer,
Vicellous Drum, the bank could escape.

877
01:06:35,323 --> 01:06:38,674
Then inactivated by Darrien Drum.

878
01:06:40,389 --> 01:06:43,567
And then shot Drum Swiss girl dead.

879
01:06:43,986 --> 01:06:46,199
Five dead, eight to go.

880
01:06:46,299 --> 01:06:51,676
What a fucking bullshit.
Nice story.

881
01:06:51,776 --> 01:06:53,852
It's not open.

882
01:06:53,952 --> 01:06:57,921
The money is yours to fly paper
here to lure and kill you.

883
01:06:58,021 --> 01:07:02,611
There is no money.
- Of course there is money. Shut up.

884
01:07:02,678 --> 01:07:08,538
Really, we've been working too hard.
- This is not a bank robbery.

885
01:07:19,502 --> 01:07:21,502
Damn.

886
01:07:21,607 --> 01:07:27,254
This is the best bank robbery ever.
- You said there was no money, eh?

887
01:07:27,354 --> 01:07:30,830
It's just fly paper.
- Yeah, I guess.

888
01:07:35,749 --> 01:07:37,348
Jeez.

889
01:07:37,448 --> 01:07:40,825
My god...

890
01:07:44,562 --> 01:07:46,860
So it does not matter
that the money is here,

891
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:48,475
Drum because everyone is dead?

892
01:07:48,575 --> 01:07:51,285
We love to 't be.

893
01:07:53,946 --> 01:07:56,921
I do not know who of you Drum is...

894
01:07:57,875 --> 01:08:00,513
...but keep me away.

895
01:08:15,865 --> 01:08:17,336
Grab a gun?
- No, it does not matter.

896
01:08:17,436 --> 01:08:21,391
Drum his plan was always to everyone
murder. We must be smarter than him.

897
01:08:21,491 --> 01:08:23,717
How to kill so many armed people?

898
01:08:23,817 --> 01:08:26,346
Lights, night viewers,
and kill everyone.

899
01:08:26,446 --> 01:08:30,070
Why do I get there not?
- You said something about night vision.

900
01:08:30,170 --> 01:08:32,598
In the bathroom there is one.
- What more do you need then?

901
01:08:32,698 --> 01:08:35,283
Which man will get night vision goggles,
Drum's.

902
01:08:35,383 --> 01:08:37,601
Or any woman.

903
01:08:44,976 --> 01:08:48,109
How do we get it all in there?

904
01:08:48,731 --> 01:08:52,833
How much do you think this is?
- Four or five million.

905
01:08:52,933 --> 01:08:55,087
Let us begin.

906
01:09:02,008 --> 01:09:06,163
Really? Now go save the Bank?
- No, I want with you.

907
01:09:06,263 --> 01:09:08,370
There is 'one damn killer.

908
01:09:08,470 --> 01:09:11,245
I'm going too.
- Me too.

909
01:09:11,345 --> 01:09:13,859
Do not forget me.
- We are all here.

910
01:09:13,959 --> 01:09:15,944
Let each other holding hands.

911
01:09:16,044 --> 01:09:19,810
Seriously. You never get away.

912
01:09:19,910 --> 01:09:24,132
Do not say Amen to that sort of thing.
You will frighten Jelly.

913
01:09:24,232 --> 01:09:29,531
Tripp is actually right.
That remote has no battery.

914
01:09:31,299 --> 01:09:35,219
Are you kidding?
What bastard has the battery?

915
01:09:35,439 --> 01:09:37,547
Vicellous Drum.

916
01:09:40,531 --> 01:09:42,481
You took the battery to us here to keep.

917
01:09:42,581 --> 01:09:45,089
No.
- You wander through the bank.

918
01:09:45,189 --> 01:09:49,390
You could at any time someone
have slain. The perfect crime...

919
01:09:49,490 --> 01:09:54,797
...you solve yourself.
Unbelievable that I kissed.

920
01:09:54,897 --> 01:09:57,441
You should not take a genius to
to come under your skirts.

921
01:09:57,541 --> 01:09:59,625
Flatter yourself that you would get this far.

922
01:09:59,725 --> 01:10:02,933
If the rest of you idiots had
Attention, did you realize...

923
01:10:03,033 --> 01:10:06,434
...that all the evidence point to Madge.

924
01:10:06,739 --> 01:10:08,739
Not true.

925
01:10:25,550 --> 01:10:29,165
Who turned out the light?
- Come on. Not again.

926
01:10:29,265 --> 01:10:33,857
Shoot everything that moves.

927
01:10:44,004 --> 01:10:46,004
Vicellous Drum.

928
01:11:06,454 --> 01:11:09,548
Where is he?
- We 't seen.

929
01:11:41,848 --> 01:11:43,848
Come out.

930
01:11:44,053 --> 01:11:47,607
Forwards.

931
01:11:47,707 --> 01:11:51,104
I'm not Vicellous Drum.

932
01:11:51,613 --> 01:11:53,784
I took the lights off because I knew...

933
01:11:53,884 --> 01:11:56,453
...that the real viewer
would drum the night out.

934
01:11:56,553 --> 01:12:00,038
Then I went to the bathroom and I waited.

935
01:12:10,288 --> 01:12:12,918
A bank manager a golden heart.

936
01:12:13,018 --> 01:12:16,611
Everyone is surprised
when they hear it's you.

937
01:12:16,711 --> 01:12:18,711
You think?

938
01:12:20,005 --> 01:12:22,963
Those clowns in the lobby thinking
that you're Vicellous Drum.

939
01:12:23,063 --> 01:12:27,818
They will kill you,
so they are more a hero like.

940
01:12:27,918 --> 01:12:32,156
If you kill me,
you seem even more Drum.

941
01:12:32,256 --> 01:12:35,742
So, you're lapping anyway.

942
01:12:45,558 --> 01:12:49,444
A very entertaining story,
but nobody believes it.

943
01:12:49,544 --> 01:12:53,667
Come on out.
Enough lies, it's game over.

944
01:12:53,767 --> 01:12:55,778
Not so fast.

945
01:13:00,732 --> 01:13:03,282
Tripp and I have run into you.

946
01:13:03,363 --> 01:13:10,588
We knew that when the lights would go out,
that the offender would go to night vision.

947
01:13:16,571 --> 01:13:19,590
You can kill all of us, right?

948
01:13:19,690 --> 01:13:21,690
No.

949
01:13:24,780 --> 01:13:29,841
Every one million U.S. dollars.
Undetectable.

950
01:13:32,915 --> 01:13:34,915
All.

951
01:13:38,144 --> 01:13:40,170
Two million.

952
01:13:40,270 --> 01:13:42,343
Put the weapon down.

953
01:13:42,820 --> 01:13:44,976
Put it down and we talk.

954
01:13:47,181 --> 01:13:49,405
Damn.

955
01:14:02,253 --> 01:14:04,978
And then there were about six.

956
01:14:21,477 --> 01:14:24,030
Thank you, guest.

957
01:14:24,802 --> 01:14:28,254
That solves it in me.

958
01:14:33,958 --> 01:14:37,505
Take 't. It is insured.

959
01:14:43,619 --> 01:14:46,643
Blessed new appointment.

960
01:14:50,365 --> 01:14:53,763
Thank you, Badger.
I say one more thing:

961
01:14:53,863 --> 01:14:57,048
From now on, Jelly and I do not
more criminals.

962
01:14:57,148 --> 01:15:01,097
That's right.

963
01:15:07,508 --> 01:15:10,160
I almost forgot my ear.

964
01:15:16,184 --> 01:15:19,783
And ultimately, Peanut Butter
Jelly and with the money going to run?

965
01:15:19,883 --> 01:15:24,641
Crazy, huh?
They went to Winnipeg or something.

966
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:27,391
Thank you.
You may go.

967
01:15:27,491 --> 01:15:31,133
Close everything.
- Your medication, sir.

968
01:15:31,356 --> 01:15:33,652
I take everything.

969
01:15:35,382 --> 01:15:36,931
I would the word 'hero' is not used.

970
01:15:37,031 --> 01:15:42,035
I led my team of hostages
through the darkest time of their lives? Yes.

971
01:15:42,135 --> 01:15:43,483
I want two months paid time off.

972
01:15:43,583 --> 01:15:46,075
I want to wear jeans five days a week.
Not just on Fridays.

973
01:15:46,175 --> 01:15:48,810
And I want lenses in both eyes.

974
01:15:49,166 --> 01:15:51,930
That you must not do.
- No problem.

975
01:15:52,030 --> 01:15:54,030
Thank you.

976
01:16:00,899 --> 01:16:02,702
Please, ma'am.

977
01:16:02,802 --> 01:16:05,026
Congratulations.

978
01:16:05,126 --> 01:16:07,126
Thanks again, officer.

979
01:16:10,896 --> 01:16:14,230
What is this? A toaster?

980
01:16:15,307 --> 01:16:17,307
A controlled boat?

981
01:16:20,486 --> 01:16:23,036
Some people like to get money.

982
01:16:23,603 --> 01:16:26,512
I thought you were never true story.

983
01:16:26,612 --> 01:16:28,470
Then I remembered that
Weinstein said he...

984
01:16:28,570 --> 01:16:31,097
...two bank robberies Tonight was shot...

985
01:16:31,197 --> 01:16:34,157
...and then I realized that
are basically three robberies.

986
01:16:34,257 --> 01:16:35,874
A pretty good plan.

987
01:16:35,974 --> 01:16:39,117
Kaitlin Nest?
She married the wrong guy.

988
01:16:39,217 --> 01:16:42,374
What a touching story.
You fake fiance, Max...

989
01:16:42,474 --> 01:16:44,090
...explains your expensive taste.

990
01:16:44,190 --> 01:16:48,208
It explains your exotic travel
and your exorbitant demands.

991
01:16:48,308 --> 01:16:51,423
And you have your wedding gifts
walk outside with heaps of money...

992
01:16:51,523 --> 01:16:53,648
...no one asks questions.

993
01:16:53,927 --> 01:16:55,605
You did you make a move
about seven hours...

994
01:16:55,705 --> 01:16:56,794
...when the security went out...

995
01:16:56,894 --> 01:17:00,980
...but Derrien, Drum and everything else
ruined your plan.

996
01:17:01,080 --> 01:17:04,364
But you waited for it right now.

997
01:17:04,464 --> 01:17:08,799
And when I turned off the lights,
You did your move.

998
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:23,722
Take 't. It is insured.

999
01:17:25,810 --> 01:17:27,943
It's really brilliant.

1000
01:17:28,043 --> 01:17:30,901
Nobody goes to the wedding present
of a woman opening...

1001
01:17:31,001 --> 01:17:36,186
...and the policemen carry the
still in the trunk of your car.

1002
01:17:36,942 --> 01:17:39,321
I honestly love you.

1003
01:17:39,936 --> 01:17:42,151
Is that too early?

1004
01:17:42,251 --> 01:17:44,981
What do you want?
- I want to join.

1005
01:17:45,081 --> 01:17:48,585
Is that so?
- Equal partners. No violence.

1006
01:17:48,685 --> 01:17:51,756
Why should I not murder?
- You are not murderous.

1007
01:17:51,856 --> 01:17:53,680
I feel like me.
- You think?

1008
01:17:53,780 --> 01:17:56,670
Yes, it's fun.
We are a great team.

1009
01:17:57,107 --> 01:17:59,339
What do you think?

1010
01:18:02,265 --> 01:18:05,500
Are you going to flip?
- What do you mean?

1011
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:11,040
The last time I kissed you,
You freaked out. That was pretty sad.

1012
01:18:17,955 --> 01:18:21,257
What is your real name?
- Alexis Black, No. 3 in banks.

1013
01:18:21,357 --> 01:18:24,225
That's so...
