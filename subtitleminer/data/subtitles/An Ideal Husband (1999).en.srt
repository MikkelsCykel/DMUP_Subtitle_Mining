2
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,586
The usual, m'Lord.

3
00:01:16,008 --> 00:01:17,573
Good morning, m'Lord.

4
00:01:29,457 --> 00:01:30,583
The morning paper, m'Lord.

5
00:01:37,031 --> 00:01:41,465
Ah Sir Robert Chiltern
a rising star in Parliament...

6
00:01:41,502 --> 00:01:46,307
tonight hosts a party that promises to
be the highlight of the social calendar...

7
00:01:46,344 --> 00:01:48,840
Er, with his wife Lady Gertrude...

8
00:01:48,877 --> 00:01:52,481
who is herself a leading figure
in women's politics.

9
00:01:52,518 --> 00:01:53,346
Together...

10
00:01:53,382 --> 00:01:57,854
this couple represents what is
best in the English public life...

11
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:01,509
and is a noble contrast
to the lax morality...

12
00:02:01,545 --> 00:02:05,129
Er, so common amongst
foreign politicians.

13
00:02:05,165 --> 00:02:06,360
Dear oh dear...

14
00:02:06,397 --> 00:02:09,033
they will never say that about me,
will they

15
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:11,399
I sincerely hope not, sir.

16
00:02:12,236 --> 00:02:13,834
Bit of a busy day today,
I'm afraid.

17
00:02:13,871 --> 00:02:17,175
Distressingly little time
for sloth or idleness.

18
00:02:17,211 --> 00:02:19,074
Sorry to hear it, sir.

19
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:22,414
Well, not entirely your fault,
Phipps.

20
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:24,042
Not this time.

21
00:02:25,451 --> 00:02:27,077
Thank you, m'Lord.

22
00:02:46,406 --> 00:02:47,991
Good morning, to Tommy.

23
00:02:48,027 --> 00:02:49,539
Morning, Lady Chilterm.

24
00:02:49,576 --> 00:02:52,306
I very much look forward
to this evening.

25
00:02:53,347 --> 00:02:54,348
Miss Mabel...

26
00:02:54,384 --> 00:02:55,012
Tommy.

27
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:57,614
I hope you'll be able to
make our usual appointment...

28
00:02:57,651 --> 00:03:00,179
as I have something
particular I wish to say to you.

29
00:03:01,255 --> 00:03:02,483
Good day, ladies.

30
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:08,289
When Tommy wants to be romantic
he talks to one just like a doctor.

31
00:03:09,297 --> 00:03:10,560
Till tonight.

32
00:03:11,633 --> 00:03:13,414
Miss Mabel.

33
00:03:13,451 --> 00:03:15,196
Lord Goring.

34
00:03:17,206 --> 00:03:18,469
Lord Goring!

35
00:03:20,476 --> 00:03:22,342
Countess-good morning.

36
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:24,547
Aren't you going to congratulate me,
Lord Goring?

37
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:26,279
Congratulations.

38
00:03:26,315 --> 00:03:29,449
Aren't you going to ask what for?

39
00:03:29,486 --> 00:03:31,987
I have made a great decision.
I've decided to get married.

40
00:03:32,024 --> 00:03:34,021
My God! Who to?

41
00:03:34,057 --> 00:03:36,855
That part-is still to be decided.

42
00:03:37,627 --> 00:03:40,398
Good morning, dear To Gertrude.

43
00:03:40,434 --> 00:03:42,366
Good morning, Lady Markby.

44
00:03:43,034 --> 00:03:45,436
Allow me to introduce my friend,
Mrs. Cheveley.

45
00:03:45,472 --> 00:03:47,839
Two such charming women
should know each other.

46
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:48,970
How do you do?

47
00:03:49,007 --> 00:03:51,643
I think Mrs. Cheveley and I
have met before.

48
00:03:51,679 --> 00:03:53,270
of course.

49
00:03:53,945 --> 00:03:55,310
Gertrude.

50
00:03:56,081 --> 00:03:58,881
And to think you married
Sir Robert Chiltern.

51
00:03:58,918 --> 00:04:02,588
Do you know, I was so hoping to
meet your clever husband.

52
00:04:02,624 --> 00:04:03,854
Really?

53
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:07,261
Yes. But I have to return
to Vienna on Friday.

54
00:04:07,297 --> 00:04:09,387
Oh dear, what a shame.

55
00:04:12,532 --> 00:04:15,936
Well, perhaps I might bring her
this evening?

56
00:04:15,973 --> 00:04:17,522
Yes, by all means.

57
00:04:17,559 --> 00:04:18,916
What can I say?

58
00:04:18,953 --> 00:04:20,238
I'd be delighted.

59
00:04:20,274 --> 00:04:21,974
Well we'll see you tonight.

60
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:23,374
See you tonight.

61
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:53,510
You see, Phipps,
fashion is what one wears oneself.

62
00:04:53,546 --> 00:04:56,247
What is unfashionable...

63
00:04:56,284 --> 00:04:58,949
is what other people wear.

64
00:04:58,986 --> 00:05:00,146
Yes, my Lord.

65
00:05:00,183 --> 00:05:01,615
Other people are quite dreadful.

66
00:05:01,651 --> 00:05:03,855
The only possible society is oneself.

67
00:05:03,891 --> 00:05:05,723
Er, yes, my Lord.

68
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,555
To love oneself...

69
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:12,497
is the beginning of
a lifelong romance.

70
00:05:12,533 --> 00:05:13,987
Yes, my Lord.

71
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:28,313
Their Graces,
the Duke and Duchess of Berwick.

72
00:05:32,284 --> 00:05:34,582
Lord Windermere.

73
00:05:37,924 --> 00:05:39,391
Countess Basildon.

74
00:05:40,193 --> 00:05:46,297
...and it is widely agreed, the last
truly decent man in London... such...

75
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:50,004
and that you're a very personable man
possessed of a most attractive personality...

76
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,842
and that you have brought into British
politics an honesty, an integrity...

77
00:05:53,878 --> 00:05:54,873
a finer, a...

78
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:59,247
a nobler atmosphere a finer attitude
and higher ideals... higher ideals.

79
00:05:59,283 --> 00:06:03,369
Well, one mustn't believe everything
one reads in the newspapers.

80
00:06:03,406 --> 00:06:07,419
Yes, in the old days we had the rack.
Nowadays we have the press.

81
00:06:07,456 --> 00:06:11,060
Your own newspaper being the notable
exception, of course, Sir Edward...

82
00:06:11,097 --> 00:06:13,630
where truth shines out like a beacon...

83
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:16,165
and lies run vainly for the shadows.

84
00:06:16,201 --> 00:06:18,564
Bravo, Lady Chiltern.

85
00:06:18,601 --> 00:06:22,204
But may I ask, do I detect
in your conversation a lyricism...

86
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,808
not entirely uncommon
in your husband's excellent speeches?

87
00:06:25,845 --> 00:06:28,341
If you are suggesting Sir Edward...

88
00:06:28,378 --> 00:06:31,248
that my position in society owes anything
to my wife, you are utterly mistaken.

89
00:06:31,284 --> 00:06:33,118
It owes everything to my wife.

90
00:06:33,155 --> 00:06:34,916
I demand that you make it known

91
00:06:34,953 --> 00:06:38,821
immediately without her, it's true,
I am entirely unexceptional.

92
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,590
Without her love...

93
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,057
I'm nothing.

94
00:06:46,497 --> 00:06:51,302
Anyway, all I know is, Chiltern, a serious
shake-up in the Government looks inevitable now...

95
00:06:51,339 --> 00:06:54,940
and I have to tell you the Prime Minster
himself was asking about you this morning.

96
00:06:54,976 --> 00:06:56,306
Really?

97
00:06:56,343 --> 00:06:58,310
Probably afraid you'd
be taking his job.

98
00:06:58,347 --> 00:07:00,276
Lady Markby.

99
00:07:00,313 --> 00:07:02,206
Mrs. Cheveley.

100
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:11,324
Oh, my dear if I had a jewel
for every staring eye...

101
00:07:11,361 --> 00:07:14,894
I'm glad to say, Lady Markby,
you evidently do.

102
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:15,491
Excuse me.

103
00:07:15,528 --> 00:07:18,965
Ah, chere Madame
quelle surprise!

104
00:07:19,002 --> 00:07:20,164
Lady Markby.

105
00:07:20,201 --> 00:07:21,466
I have not seen you since Berlin.

106
00:07:21,502 --> 00:07:23,767
Not since Berlin, Vicomte,
five years ago.

107
00:07:23,804 --> 00:07:27,808
And you are younger and
more beautiful than ever.

108
00:07:27,845 --> 00:07:28,840
How do you manage it?

109
00:07:28,876 --> 00:07:33,115
By making it a rule only to talk
to charming people like yourself.

110
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:34,844
Mrs. Cheveley.

111
00:07:35,285 --> 00:07:36,548
What do we know about her?

112
00:07:36,585 --> 00:07:40,456
Very influential in Vienna
In the highest circles.

113
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:43,189
A force to be reckoned with.

114
00:07:43,226 --> 00:07:44,778
And are you staying in
London long?

115
00:07:44,814 --> 00:07:46,329
That depends partly
on the weather...

116
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:48,349
partly on the cooking...

117
00:07:48,386 --> 00:07:50,297
and partly on your brother.

118
00:07:50,334 --> 00:07:52,934
My dear... Sir Robert has been
dying to meet you.

119
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:55,756
Everyone is dying to meet
the brilliant Mrs. Cheveley.

120
00:07:55,792 --> 00:07:58,542
Our Attaches in Vienna write to us
about nothing else.

121
00:07:58,579 --> 00:07:59,540
Thank you, Sir Robert.

122
00:07:59,577 --> 00:08:04,181
An acquaintance that begins with a compliment
is sure to develop into a real friendship.

123
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:05,316
I see you've met my sister.

124
00:08:05,353 --> 00:08:06,977
Yes indeed.

125
00:08:07,852 --> 00:08:13,051
My dear child allow me to introduce
you to the Vicomte De Nanjac.

126
00:08:14,993 --> 00:08:17,796
You have a beautiful house,
Sir Robert.

127
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:19,161
We're very happy here.

128
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:21,967
I am sure. I would so love
to look around.

129
00:08:22,003 --> 00:08:22,934
Allow me.

130
00:08:22,971 --> 00:08:23,866
Thank you.

131
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,966
Lord Goring.

132
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:32,395
Good evening, Lady Rosebury.

133
00:08:32,432 --> 00:08:34,845
Good evening, young lady.

134
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:37,384
Well, sir,
what are you doing here?

135
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:38,782
Wasting your life as usual.

136
00:08:38,819 --> 00:08:40,818
You should be in bed, sir.
You keep too late hours.

137
00:08:40,855 --> 00:08:43,958
I heard of you the other night at Lady
Rufford's dancing till four o'clock.

138
00:08:43,995 --> 00:08:45,790
Er, good evening, father.

139
00:08:45,827 --> 00:08:48,513
Can't make out how you stand
London society.

140
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:51,163
Lot of damn nobodies
talking about nothing.

141
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,169
I love talking about nothing, father.
It's the only thing I know anything about.

142
00:08:54,205 --> 00:08:57,138
That is a paradox, sir.
I hate paradoxes.

143
00:08:57,174 --> 00:08:58,537
So do I, father.

144
00:08:58,574 --> 00:09:00,975
Everyone one meets is
a paradox nowadays.

145
00:09:01,012 --> 00:09:04,176
Makes society so... obvious, hmm?

146
00:09:04,212 --> 00:09:06,949
Do you always understand
what you say, sir?

147
00:09:06,985 --> 00:09:11,284
Yes. If I listen attentively.

148
00:09:13,857 --> 00:09:16,519
Oh, conceited young puppy!

149
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:21,030
And I have it on very good authority that
you have some delightful Corots as well.

150
00:09:21,067 --> 00:09:23,047
Oh, really whose?

151
00:09:23,084 --> 00:09:25,027
Baron Arnheim.

152
00:09:30,841 --> 00:09:32,144
Did you know the Baron well?

153
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,112
Intimately. Did you?

154
00:09:34,148 --> 00:09:35,210
At one time.

155
00:09:35,246 --> 00:09:36,478
Wonderful man, wasn't he?

156
00:09:36,514 --> 00:09:38,413
He was very remarkable in many ways.

157
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:43,221
I often think it a pity he never wrote his
memoirs. They would have been interesting.

158
00:09:43,257 --> 00:09:47,025
Allow me to introduce my dearest
friend. The idlest man in London.

159
00:09:47,062 --> 00:09:49,262
Good evening, Lord Goring.

160
00:09:49,299 --> 00:09:51,061
You've met?

161
00:09:51,098 --> 00:09:54,333
I did not think you'd remember me,
Mrs. Er Cheveley.

162
00:09:54,369 --> 00:09:56,987
My memory is
under admirable control.

163
00:09:57,023 --> 00:09:59,605
Sir Robert,
the Indian Ambassador.

164
00:09:59,642 --> 00:10:00,867
Excuse me!

165
00:10:04,844 --> 00:10:06,810
And so, my dear Arthur...

166
00:10:06,847 --> 00:10:09,717
are you not just
a little bit pleased to see me?

167
00:10:09,753 --> 00:10:12,587
Oh, my dear woman...
possibly even less than that.

168
00:10:12,623 --> 00:10:14,585
should you wish to
avoid me entirely...

169
00:10:14,621 --> 00:10:18,158
it is well to know that I'll be
staying at Claridges Hotel until Friday

170
00:10:18,195 --> 00:10:20,422
when I shall return to Vienna.

171
00:10:21,429 --> 00:10:23,064
Are you still a bachelor?

172
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,396
Resolutely so.

173
00:10:24,432 --> 00:10:26,635
Lord Goring is the result of
Boodle's Club, Mrs. Cheveley.

174
00:10:26,671 --> 00:10:29,238
He reflects every credit
on the institution.

175
00:10:29,274 --> 00:10:30,262
Thank you.

176
00:10:42,586 --> 00:10:45,988
And now, Sir Robert,
I have something to say to you.

177
00:10:46,424 --> 00:10:48,058
You'll find me an eager audience.

178
00:10:48,094 --> 00:10:49,290
I'm so glad.

179
00:10:49,326 --> 00:10:52,963
I want to talk to you about a great
political and financial scheme...

180
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,058
about this Argentine Company,
in fact.

181
00:10:57,701 --> 00:11:01,135
What a tedious, practical subject
to talk about, Mrs. Cheveley.

182
00:11:01,172 --> 00:11:05,677
Oh, I like tedious, practical subjects.
What I don't like are practical people.

183
00:11:05,713 --> 00:11:10,549
Besides, you're interested. I know,
in international canal schemes.

184
00:11:10,585 --> 00:11:12,016
Yes.

185
00:11:13,485 --> 00:11:16,623
But the Suez Canal was a very
great and splendid undertaking.

186
00:11:16,659 --> 00:11:19,853
It gave us our direct route
into India.

187
00:11:21,026 --> 00:11:24,781
This Argentine scheme is
a commonplace Stock Exchange swindle.

188
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:28,536
It is a speculation, Sir Robert,
a brilliant, daring speculation.

189
00:11:28,572 --> 00:11:32,369
Believe me, Mrs. Cheveley,
it is a swindle.

190
00:11:32,406 --> 00:11:36,137
Let us call things by their proper
names. It makes matters simpler.

191
00:11:39,214 --> 00:11:41,479
I hope you've not invested in it.

192
00:11:41,515 --> 00:11:43,517
I'm sure you're far too clever
to have done that.

193
00:11:43,553 --> 00:11:47,352
I have invested very largely in it.

194
00:11:47,389 --> 00:11:48,924
Who could have advised you to do
such a foolish thing?

195
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,458
Your old friend and mine.

196
00:11:50,494 --> 00:11:51,055
Who?

197
00:11:51,092 --> 00:11:51,923
Baron Arnheim.

198
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:55,020
It was one of the last things
he said.

199
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:10,646
The future of the canal depends, of course,
on the attitude of Her Majesty's Government.

200
00:12:10,683 --> 00:12:13,446
And...

201
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:16,950
I will personally be
presenting my report...

202
00:12:16,987 --> 00:12:20,419
to the House of Commons
on Thursday night.

203
00:12:21,392 --> 00:12:24,362
I can tell you now that I will
be condemning the scheme in

204
00:12:24,398 --> 00:12:25,798
no uncertain terms.

205
00:12:25,834 --> 00:12:27,162
That you must not do.

206
00:12:27,198 --> 00:12:29,434
In your own interests,
to say nothing of mine...

207
00:12:29,471 --> 00:12:31,900
you must not do that.

208
00:12:31,937 --> 00:12:34,206
Mr. dear Mrs. Cheveley
what do you mean?

209
00:12:34,243 --> 00:12:36,439
Sir Robert,
I will be quite frank with you.

210
00:12:36,475 --> 00:12:41,013
I want you to amend that report to state
that the canal will be of international value.

211
00:12:41,049 --> 00:12:43,071
Will you do that for me?

212
00:12:46,352 --> 00:12:48,003
You cannot be serious.

213
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,618
I am quite serious...

214
00:12:49,655 --> 00:12:54,160
and if you do what I ask
I will pay you very handsomely.

215
00:12:54,196 --> 00:12:54,959
Pay me?

216
00:12:54,995 --> 00:12:58,698
My dear Sir Robert, you are a man of the
world and you have you price, I suppose.

217
00:12:58,735 --> 00:13:00,464
Everybody has nowadays.

218
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:04,405
If you will allow me,
I will call your carriage for you.

219
00:13:04,441 --> 00:13:06,271
You have lived so long abroad,
Mrs. Cheveley...

220
00:13:06,307 --> 00:13:09,543
that you seem to be unable to realise that
you're talking to an English gentleman.

221
00:13:09,579 --> 00:13:11,376
I realize that
I'm talking to a man...

222
00:13:11,413 --> 00:13:16,043
whose past is perhaps less perfect
than his reputation would suggest.

223
00:13:18,954 --> 00:13:21,153
What are you saying?

224
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:24,860
I am saying that I know the real
origin of your wealth and your career...

225
00:13:24,897 --> 00:13:27,921
...and I have got your letter too.

226
00:13:30,367 --> 00:13:31,885
You are very late.

227
00:13:31,921 --> 00:13:33,402
Did you miss me?

228
00:13:33,439 --> 00:13:34,133
Awfully.

229
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:37,173
Then I am sorry I did not stay away
later. I like being missed.

230
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:38,273
How very selfish of you.

231
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:39,538
I am very selfish.

232
00:13:39,575 --> 00:13:42,178
Lord Goring, you are always telling
me about your bad qualities.

233
00:13:42,214 --> 00:13:44,213
And I haven't told you the half of
them as yet. Miss Mabel.

234
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,214
Really? Are the others very bad?

235
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:51,017
Quite dreadful. When I think of them
at night I can go to sleep at once.

236
00:13:51,423 --> 00:13:53,421
Well...

237
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:58,062
I must tell you that I like your qualities
and I wouldn't have you part with one.

238
00:13:58,099 --> 00:14:00,863
This shows
your admirable good taste.

239
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:03,601
Miss Mabel. May I have the pleasure
of escorting you to the music room?

240
00:14:03,638 --> 00:14:06,037
Why, Tommy, I'd be delighted.

241
00:14:06,074 --> 00:14:07,236
As indeed would I.

242
00:14:07,273 --> 00:14:08,605
Are you coming to the music room?

243
00:14:08,641 --> 00:14:11,610
Um, not if there is any music
going on, Miss Mabel.

244
00:14:11,647 --> 00:14:13,965
Well the music is in German...

245
00:14:14,001 --> 00:14:16,283
so you would not understand it.

246
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,444
Quite so, quite so.

247
00:14:19,453 --> 00:14:20,884
Arthur!

248
00:14:20,921 --> 00:14:22,352
Gertrude, good evening.

249
00:14:22,389 --> 00:14:24,221
Didn't think you liked
political parties.

250
00:14:24,258 --> 00:14:29,354
I adore political parties. They're the
place left where people don't talk politics.

251
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:36,002
The affair to which you allude
was no more than a speculation.

252
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:37,435
It was a swindle, Sir Robert.

253
00:14:37,472 --> 00:14:41,306
"Let's call things by their proper
names. It makes matters simpler."

254
00:14:41,943 --> 00:14:44,643
And now I'm going to
sell you that letter back...

255
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:49,913
and the price I ask for it is your
public support of the Argentine scheme.

256
00:14:51,486 --> 00:14:53,586
I cannot do what you ask me.

257
00:14:53,622 --> 00:14:57,025
You are standing on the edge of
a precipice, Sir Robert.

258
00:14:57,062 --> 00:15:00,028
Supposing you refuse?

259
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:00,626
What then?

260
00:15:00,662 --> 00:15:03,499
Suppose I were to pay a visit
to a newspaper office

261
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:06,337
and give them this scandal...
and the proof of it.

262
00:15:06,373 --> 00:15:07,901
Think of their loathsome joy.

263
00:15:07,937 --> 00:15:10,608
Think of the delight they would
have in tearing you down.

264
00:15:10,645 --> 00:15:12,107
Think...

265
00:15:12,143 --> 00:15:13,570
Sir Edward.

266
00:15:14,044 --> 00:15:16,511
My dear Mrs. Cheveley.

267
00:15:16,547 --> 00:15:19,551
I do hope we have the opportunity
to meet up while you're in London.

268
00:15:19,587 --> 00:15:22,353
I so enjoy the cut and thrust
of continental politics.

269
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:24,982
I shall make it a
particular priority.

270
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:27,648
Sir Robert.

271
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:37,135
It is infamous what you propose.

272
00:15:37,172 --> 00:15:37,933
Infamous.

273
00:15:37,969 --> 00:15:40,825
Oh no... it is the game of life,
Sir Robert...

274
00:15:41,033 --> 00:15:44,683
...as we all have to play it...
sooner of later.

275
00:16:08,069 --> 00:16:11,907
What a charming house, Lady Chiltern.
I have spent a delightful evening.

276
00:16:11,943 --> 00:16:13,672
I'm so glad.

277
00:16:13,709 --> 00:16:17,946
And so glad, too, you had a chance
to meet my husband, Mrs. Cheveley.

278
00:16:17,982 --> 00:16:19,811
Though...

279
00:16:19,848 --> 00:16:24,553
I must confess to some curiosity as
to the matter of your conversation.

280
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:26,455
Your carriage is waiting,
Mrs. Cheveley.

281
00:16:26,492 --> 00:16:27,554
Thanks.

282
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:31,361
Well, another time perhaps,
Lady Chiltern, Good evening.

283
00:16:31,397 --> 00:16:33,556
Good evening, Mrs. Cheveley.

284
00:16:34,898 --> 00:16:36,529
Will you see me out, Sir Robert?

285
00:16:36,566 --> 00:16:38,935
Now that we have
the same interests at heart,

286
00:16:38,972 --> 00:16:42,393
we will be great friends, I hope.

287
00:16:43,006 --> 00:16:44,497
Certainly.

288
00:16:51,082 --> 00:16:53,114
You must let me have more time
to consider your proposal.

289
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:57,289
There is nothing to consider. Support
the scheme and I will return the letter.

290
00:16:57,326 --> 00:17:00,423
Scandals used to lend charm,
or at least interest, to a man...

291
00:17:00,459 --> 00:17:05,030
nowadays they crush him. And yours
is a very nasty scandal, Sir Robert.

292
00:17:05,067 --> 00:17:07,433
You would be hounded
out of public life.

293
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:10,028
You would disappear completely.

294
00:17:10,537 --> 00:17:12,198
My God!

295
00:17:13,606 --> 00:17:15,174
What brought you into my life?

296
00:17:15,211 --> 00:17:16,606
Circumstances.

297
00:17:16,642 --> 00:17:22,514
At some point we all have to pay for
what we do. You have to pay now.

298
00:17:24,218 --> 00:17:27,552
I will give you any sum of money
you want.

299
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:31,326
Even you're not rich enough
to buy back your past.

300
00:17:31,362 --> 00:17:33,555
No man is.

301
00:17:54,116 --> 00:17:57,187
...yes, but the fact is, father this
is not my day for talking seriously.

302
00:17:57,224 --> 00:17:58,588
I am very sorry
but it is not my day.

303
00:17:58,624 --> 00:17:59,587
What do you mean, sir?

304
00:17:59,623 --> 00:18:01,555
I mean that during the season,
father...

305
00:18:01,591 --> 00:18:05,362
I only talk seriously on the
first Tuesday in every month.

306
00:18:05,399 --> 00:18:06,260
Between noon and three.

307
00:18:06,296 --> 00:18:08,631
Well make it Tuesday, sir.
Make it Tuesday.

308
00:18:08,668 --> 00:18:10,932
Ah, yes, but it's before noon,
father...

309
00:18:10,968 --> 00:18:13,237
and that's what I'm trying to say. I'm
very sorry but my doctor said specifically.

310
00:18:13,273 --> 00:18:15,170
You are thirty-six...

311
00:18:15,372 --> 00:18:17,572
Father!

312
00:18:17,608 --> 00:18:19,077
I only admit to thirty-two.

313
00:18:19,113 --> 00:18:20,546
You are thirty-six...

314
00:18:20,582 --> 00:18:21,980
and you must get a wife.

315
00:18:22,016 --> 00:18:24,142
Wife?

316
00:18:27,586 --> 00:18:31,148
A shade lack luster this morning,
Chiltern.

317
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:37,096
Mind on other matters
I shouldn't wonder.

318
00:18:38,931 --> 00:18:42,959
I had that Cheveley woman drive
by the office last night.

319
00:18:43,336 --> 00:18:45,155
Really?

320
00:18:45,192 --> 00:18:46,937
Yes.

321
00:18:46,974 --> 00:18:51,479
Wanted me to write a piece
about this Argentine thing.

322
00:18:51,515 --> 00:18:54,281
Quite interesting really.

323
00:18:54,318 --> 00:18:55,417
Mentioned you.

324
00:18:55,453 --> 00:18:56,915
Did she?

325
00:18:56,952 --> 00:18:59,147
She did indeed.

326
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:04,089
So what did she say?

327
00:19:04,126 --> 00:19:07,929
Outlined the virtues of the scheme,
that sort of thing.

328
00:19:07,965 --> 00:19:11,132
Wouldn't be surprised
if she had shares in it.

329
00:19:11,169 --> 00:19:13,132
What did she say about me?

330
00:19:13,168 --> 00:19:16,639
About your speech on it. Said I
should be prepared for a surprise.

331
00:19:16,675 --> 00:19:18,470
Wouldn't say what.

332
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:22,833
Can I take it
you've changed your position?

333
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:36,061
I wonder what kind of
a woman she is.

334
00:19:36,097 --> 00:19:37,525
Who?

335
00:19:37,561 --> 00:19:40,565
That woman, Mrs. Cheveley.

336
00:19:40,601 --> 00:19:43,398
Hmm, smallish.

337
00:19:44,235 --> 00:19:47,639
So the question remains,
where to from there, hmm?

338
00:19:47,676 --> 00:19:52,270
To the Hartlocks then the Basildons.

339
00:19:52,611 --> 00:19:55,380
...or should we go straight
to the Bachelor's Ball?

340
00:19:55,417 --> 00:19:57,816
You know, Arthur, I almost wish
I were you sometimes.

341
00:19:57,853 --> 00:20:00,182
Hmm, do you know, Robert,
I almost wish you were too.

342
00:20:00,218 --> 00:20:04,890
Except that you'd probably make something
useful out of my life and that would never do.

343
00:20:04,927 --> 00:20:06,656
You could always get married.

344
00:20:06,692 --> 00:20:09,560
It's the "always"
bit that alarms me.

345
00:20:11,464 --> 00:20:16,002
...and I could see by the glare in his
eye that he was about to do it again!

346
00:20:16,038 --> 00:20:17,434
Poor Mr. Trafford.

347
00:20:17,471 --> 00:20:19,106
It sounds quite serious.

348
00:20:19,143 --> 00:20:20,171
Oh, it is.

349
00:20:20,207 --> 00:20:22,106
He proposed to me in broad daylight

350
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:24,175
in front of that dreadful
statue of Achilles.

351
00:20:24,212 --> 00:20:28,649
oh really, the things that go on in front
of that work of art are quite appalling.

352
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:30,480
The police should interfere.

353
00:20:33,154 --> 00:20:37,159
I know it may not suit
a modern girl like you, Mabel,

354
00:20:37,195 --> 00:20:40,730
but there is, of course,
one... effective way

355
00:20:40,766 --> 00:20:42,465
to put a stop to his proposals.

356
00:20:42,501 --> 00:20:43,734
And what would that be?

357
00:20:43,771 --> 00:20:44,968
To accept one of them.

358
00:20:45,004 --> 00:20:47,198
Oh no!

359
00:20:47,971 --> 00:20:49,303
Ladies!

360
00:20:50,406 --> 00:20:54,344
By the way have you been
talking to my father?

361
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,943
Why? Should I?

362
00:20:55,979 --> 00:20:57,506
Certainly not.

363
00:20:57,947 --> 00:21:02,015
He was foolish enough to
suggest that I model myself on you.

364
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:05,456
I've always said that your father was a
man of exquisite taste and rare judgement.

365
00:21:05,492 --> 00:21:08,956
Hard work, probity and a good woman.

366
00:21:08,993 --> 00:21:13,064
He neglected to mention that you
took the last good woman I know.

367
00:21:13,101 --> 00:21:16,465
Took her right out of my arms,
if I remember correctly.

368
00:21:16,501 --> 00:21:19,437
Which you don't. What's that saying
about the sea and there being fish in it?

369
00:21:19,473 --> 00:21:22,507
Hmm, ah, yes, but I couldn't
possibly marry a fish.

370
00:21:22,544 --> 00:21:26,604
I'd be sure to land an old trout.

371
00:21:27,346 --> 00:21:30,345
I never change
except in my affection.

372
00:21:30,382 --> 00:21:33,345
What a noble nature you have,
Gwendolen!

373
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:36,590
Well then the question had better
be cleared up at once.

374
00:21:36,626 --> 00:21:37,621
But you told me yesterday.

375
00:21:37,658 --> 00:21:41,162
I have reason to believe that
the information I received was...

376
00:21:41,198 --> 00:21:42,652
prejudiced.

377
00:21:44,165 --> 00:21:45,566
Or any rate, misinformed.

378
00:21:45,603 --> 00:21:46,063
But I...

379
00:21:46,099 --> 00:21:49,069
I now believe that there may be
some benefit to the scheme after all.

380
00:21:49,106 --> 00:21:50,687
Benefit?

381
00:21:50,723 --> 00:21:52,268
To whom?

382
00:21:53,975 --> 00:21:57,741
This has nothing to do with
Mrs. Cheveley, does it?

383
00:22:00,149 --> 00:22:04,142
You seem to be displaying
signs of triviality.

384
00:22:04,486 --> 00:22:06,251
On the contrary, Aunt Augusta...

385
00:22:06,288 --> 00:22:08,958
I've now realized for
the first time in my life...

386
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:12,519
the vital importance
of being earnest.

387
00:22:15,465 --> 00:22:17,194
Robert...

388
00:22:17,634 --> 00:22:22,594
You are telling me
the whole truth?

389
00:22:23,206 --> 00:22:26,301
Why do ask me such a question?

390
00:22:29,113 --> 00:22:31,547
Why do you not answer it?

391
00:22:34,385 --> 00:22:41,588
Author!

392
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:43,625
Ladies and gentlemen...

393
00:22:43,661 --> 00:22:48,316
I have enjoyed this evening
immensely.

394
00:22:48,352 --> 00:22:52,971
Robert, is there,
in your life, any...

395
00:22:53,007 --> 00:22:59,012
any secret, any...

396
00:22:59,049 --> 00:23:02,004
indiscretion?

397
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:04,447
...which persuades me...

398
00:23:04,484 --> 00:23:06,953
that you think as highly
of the play as I so myself.

399
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:09,386
You must tell me, you must,
you must tell me at once.

400
00:23:09,423 --> 00:23:14,690
Oh, Gertrude, there is nothing in my
past life that you might not know.

401
00:23:17,699 --> 00:23:21,703
I was sure of it, my darling.

402
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,568
I was sure of it.

403
00:23:51,601 --> 00:23:56,239
You know, I found it a perfectly
charming evening. Of course I did.

404
00:23:56,276 --> 00:23:59,240
And yours was a perfectly
charming performance.

405
00:23:59,276 --> 00:24:05,045
The costumes were, of course, delightful,
but for me... it was the acting.

406
00:24:08,587 --> 00:24:10,645
Would you excuse me a moment?

407
00:24:13,192 --> 00:24:14,090
Miss Mabel?

408
00:24:14,126 --> 00:24:15,558
Good evening, Lord Goring.

409
00:24:15,595 --> 00:24:16,995
Shouldn't you be in bed,
Miss Mabel?

410
00:24:17,032 --> 00:24:18,361
Lord Goring!

411
00:24:18,398 --> 00:24:19,929
My father always tells me
to go to bed,

412
00:24:19,965 --> 00:24:21,664
so I don't see why I shouldn't
give you the same advice.

413
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:25,605
I always pass on good advice. It's
the only sensible thing to do with it.

414
00:24:25,641 --> 00:24:27,208
Well, it's very kind of you
to offer Lord Goring.

415
00:24:27,244 --> 00:24:28,827
Don't mention it, Miss Mabel.

416
00:24:28,864 --> 00:24:30,374
But I feel I should report...

417
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:34,914
that the role of elder brother is for the
moment, being more than adequately performed...

418
00:24:34,951 --> 00:24:36,116
...by my elder brother.

419
00:24:36,152 --> 00:24:36,680
Oh, really?

420
00:24:36,716 --> 00:24:42,920
Yes, Charming and delightful
performance it is too.

421
00:24:42,957 --> 00:24:45,593
I really think you ought to go to
bed straight away, Miss Mabel.

422
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:48,847
Lord Goring
you're ordering me around.

423
00:24:48,883 --> 00:24:52,065
I think
it's most courageous of you.

424
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,129
'Specially as
I'm not going to bed for hours.

425
00:25:15,159 --> 00:25:17,995
Darling, you will write
won't you

426
00:25:18,032 --> 00:25:19,927
to Mrs. Cheveley?

427
00:25:19,963 --> 00:25:23,968
And tell her that you cannot
support this scheme of hers.

428
00:25:24,004 --> 00:25:26,267
I might see her.

429
00:25:26,304 --> 00:25:29,036
Perhaps that would be better.

430
00:25:29,073 --> 00:25:32,073
Oh no, Robert, you must never
see her again.

431
00:25:32,109 --> 00:25:35,113
Darling, I know this woman.
We were at school together.

432
00:25:35,149 --> 00:25:39,046
I didn't trust her then and
I don't trust her now.

433
00:25:39,083 --> 00:25:44,078
And she must know at once that
she has been mistaken in you.

434
00:25:44,622 --> 00:25:50,564
Now all your life you have stood
apart from others.

435
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:54,769
To the world, as to myself...

436
00:25:54,806 --> 00:25:58,939
you have been an ideal.
Always.

437
00:25:58,975 --> 00:26:01,430
Be that ideal still.

438
00:26:17,125 --> 00:26:19,061
Claridges Hotel.

439
00:26:19,098 --> 00:26:19,928
No answer.

440
00:26:19,964 --> 00:26:22,897
Sir.

441
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:32,997
I love you, Robert.

442
00:26:33,909 --> 00:26:37,539
Oh, love me.

443
00:26:44,455 --> 00:26:47,322
Love me, Gertrude.

444
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:50,350
Love me always.

445
00:27:13,452 --> 00:27:15,085
Madam.

446
00:27:15,122 --> 00:27:18,391
So, what is it that brings you back
to London after all these years?

447
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:19,955
Business or pleasure?

448
00:27:19,992 --> 00:27:23,195
As it happens I have some business
with your friend, Sir Robert Chiltern...

449
00:27:23,232 --> 00:27:26,563
which, is of course,
a great pleasure.

450
00:27:32,906 --> 00:27:35,108
And what is it that
brings you here tonight?

451
00:27:35,144 --> 00:27:36,728
I came because you asked me to.

452
00:27:36,765 --> 00:27:38,313
And because you were curious?

453
00:27:38,349 --> 00:27:39,311
I suppose.

454
00:27:39,347 --> 00:27:40,378
Why did you ask me?

455
00:27:40,415 --> 00:27:43,217
Because I was curious also
to see whether you'd come.

456
00:27:43,254 --> 00:27:45,284
And you did.

457
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:48,186
I see you are quite as wilful
as you used to be.

458
00:27:48,223 --> 00:27:52,992
Far more. I've greatly improved.
I've had more experience.

459
00:27:53,028 --> 00:27:55,664
Too much experience can be a very
dangerous thing, Mrs. Cheveley.

460
00:27:55,701 --> 00:27:57,466
Why don't you call me Laura?

461
00:27:57,503 --> 00:27:58,352
I don't like the name.

462
00:27:58,388 --> 00:28:00,030
You used to adore it.

463
00:28:00,066 --> 00:28:01,635
Yes, that is why.

464
00:28:01,671 --> 00:28:05,058
To think,it was so nearly
Laura Goring.

465
00:28:05,095 --> 00:28:08,188
It has a certain ring,
don't you agree?

466
00:28:08,224 --> 00:28:11,246
We were quite well suited
I remember.

467
00:28:11,282 --> 00:28:14,651
Well, you were poor, I was rich.
It must have suited you very well.

468
00:28:14,687 --> 00:28:17,217
Until you met the Baron,
of course...

469
00:28:17,254 --> 00:28:20,224
who was richer and that
suited you much better.

470
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,191
Have you forgiven me yet?

471
00:28:21,228 --> 00:28:22,022
My dear woman...

472
00:28:22,059 --> 00:28:25,187
it's been so long now that
I'd all but forgotten you.

473
00:28:25,897 --> 00:28:27,665
Isn't that Goring?

474
00:28:27,702 --> 00:28:28,330
It is.

475
00:28:28,366 --> 00:28:31,570
I'm afraid I really must go I have
an extremely pressing engagement.

476
00:28:31,606 --> 00:28:34,035
Really? Well as you know...

477
00:28:34,071 --> 00:28:37,599
I hate to stand between
a man and his affairs.

478
00:28:49,456 --> 00:28:51,491
Come on, Bunbury,
for good ness sake.

479
00:28:51,528 --> 00:28:52,689
I can't believe it.

480
00:28:52,726 --> 00:28:54,992
You are a deserter, sir.

481
00:28:55,029 --> 00:28:55,960
I didn't say
I was getting married...

482
00:28:55,996 --> 00:28:58,432
I was merely debating
the virtues of the marital state.

483
00:28:58,469 --> 00:29:00,034
Lord Goring, there's a gentleman
to see you, sir.

484
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:01,599
Short debate, sir.

485
00:29:01,636 --> 00:29:03,434
We're a dying breed, old man.

486
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:06,007
At all costs
we must stick together.

487
00:29:06,043 --> 00:29:07,838
If you'd excuse me, gentlemen?

488
00:29:07,874 --> 00:29:09,633
Play the next hand without me.

489
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:24,043
And now I think it's time
you knew the truth...

490
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:29,465
that all these riches
this wondrous luxury...

491
00:29:29,502 --> 00:29:32,265
amounts finally to nothing.

492
00:29:32,302 --> 00:29:36,657
And that power
power over other men...

493
00:29:36,693 --> 00:29:40,975
is the one and
only thing worth having.

494
00:29:41,012 --> 00:29:47,281
Now this one I call
the 'Philosophy of Power'.

495
00:29:48,686 --> 00:29:51,386
'Gospel of Gold'.

496
00:29:51,423 --> 00:29:54,208
So now the question arises...

497
00:29:54,244 --> 00:29:57,138
how do you become
powerful.

498
00:29:57,175 --> 00:30:00,032
I mean you
personally powerful.

499
00:30:00,069 --> 00:30:02,057
Cigar?

500
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:04,525
Yes, thank you.

501
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:09,666
The answer is simple.

502
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:12,745
The answer...

503
00:30:12,781 --> 00:30:15,311
is information.

504
00:30:15,348 --> 00:30:18,251
Information is
the modern commodity...

505
00:30:18,287 --> 00:30:20,504
that can shake the world.

506
00:30:20,541 --> 00:30:22,686
And I happen to know...

507
00:30:22,723 --> 00:30:26,055
it's well within your grasp.

508
00:30:29,096 --> 00:30:31,587
And you believed what he said?

509
00:30:32,133 --> 00:30:34,033
Certainly.

510
00:30:34,301 --> 00:30:37,237
I believed it
then and I believe it now.

511
00:30:39,141 --> 00:30:41,076
You've never been poor.

512
00:30:42,377 --> 00:30:45,313
You've never known
what ambition is.

513
00:30:46,548 --> 00:30:48,175
Go on.

514
00:30:48,718 --> 00:30:51,684
Well, by now Lord Radley was
a Cabinet Minister and...

515
00:30:51,721 --> 00:30:56,159
as the Baron well knew, I was
working as his personal secretary.

516
00:30:56,196 --> 00:31:01,222
And one night, as usual
I was the last to leave the office.

517
00:31:09,173 --> 00:31:11,438
Later that evening...

518
00:31:11,475 --> 00:31:14,909
I wrote the Baron a letter containing
highly confidential information.

519
00:31:14,945 --> 00:31:21,442
And highly valuable information
regarding the financing of the Suez Canal.

520
00:31:21,986 --> 00:31:24,022
A Cabinet Secret?

521
00:31:24,059 --> 00:31:26,355
Indeed.

522
00:31:26,592 --> 00:31:32,264
In a subsequent transaction the Baron made
for himself three quarters of a million pounds.

523
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,528
And you?

524
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:39,762
I received from the Baron one
hundred and ten thousand pounds.

525
00:31:42,475 --> 00:31:44,478
You were worth more, Robert.

526
00:31:44,514 --> 00:31:46,710
No. No. No.

527
00:31:46,747 --> 00:31:52,153
I got exactly what I wanted I entered
straight into Parliament and I've...

528
00:31:52,189 --> 00:31:54,643
well I've never looked back.

529
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:57,924
Is it fair, Arthur, that some act
of youthful folly...

530
00:31:57,961 --> 00:32:00,728
should be brought up against me
now all these years later?

531
00:32:00,765 --> 00:32:01,692
Is it fair?

532
00:32:01,728 --> 00:32:04,061
Robert, life is never fair

533
00:32:04,098 --> 00:32:06,767
And Perhaps it is a good thing for
most of us that it's not.

534
00:32:06,804 --> 00:32:10,260
Now, what does Gertrude
make of all this?

535
00:32:13,341 --> 00:32:14,604
Robert?

536
00:32:18,047 --> 00:32:19,212
My dear Robert...

537
00:32:19,248 --> 00:32:23,319
secrets from other people's wives are
necessary luxury in modern life.

538
00:32:23,356 --> 00:32:27,423
But no man should have
a secret from his own wife.

539
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:29,060
She invariably finds it out.

540
00:32:29,097 --> 00:32:30,625
If I were to tell her, Arthur,

541
00:32:30,661 --> 00:32:34,188
I would lose the love of the one
woman in the world I worship.

542
00:32:34,565 --> 00:32:36,530
I couldn't tell her, but it

543
00:32:36,567 --> 00:32:39,002
did strike me
that perhaps you might.

544
00:32:41,572 --> 00:32:43,040
Go on.

545
00:32:43,508 --> 00:32:47,212
Well, perhaps you might
talk with her.

546
00:32:47,249 --> 00:32:47,743
Oh really.

547
00:32:47,779 --> 00:32:50,612
Not to tell her, of course...

548
00:32:50,648 --> 00:32:53,445
but just to
talk with her.

549
00:32:54,286 --> 00:32:55,651
I see.

550
00:32:56,187 --> 00:33:01,123
It's just that Gertrude can sometimes
be a little hard-headed.

551
00:33:01,159 --> 00:33:05,531
And you are her oldest and perhaps
closest friend and I, and I just thought...

552
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:08,067
talking with you might perhaps...

553
00:33:08,103 --> 00:33:09,898
soften her head a little?

554
00:33:09,935 --> 00:33:11,694
Well,it has been known.

555
00:33:17,177 --> 00:33:19,246
Thank you, Lady Chiltern,
that was most inspiring.

556
00:33:19,283 --> 00:33:20,679
Oh, I'm so glad.

557
00:33:30,726 --> 00:33:32,324
Well I must say, Arthur...

558
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:37,366
I'm delighted to find you showing such
a keen interest in women's politics.

559
00:33:37,402 --> 00:33:38,994
Oh yes, very keen.

560
00:33:39,468 --> 00:33:42,004
I'm afraid I had a little bit
of a late night last night.

561
00:33:42,041 --> 00:33:44,002
So I gather.

562
00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:45,073
I'm so glad to see you.

563
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:45,570
Are you?

564
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:48,577
Yes. I wanted to talk to
you about Robert.

565
00:33:48,614 --> 00:33:50,068
Really?

566
00:33:50,313 --> 00:33:52,078
He seems a little...

567
00:33:52,115 --> 00:33:54,616
distracted of late.
A little anxious.

568
00:33:54,653 --> 00:33:56,517
Yes.

569
00:33:56,553 --> 00:33:58,521
You've noticed it too?

570
00:33:59,522 --> 00:34:02,093
I suppose, er yes.

571
00:34:02,129 --> 00:34:03,290
In a way.

572
00:34:03,326 --> 00:34:07,598
I mean the life that he's chosen
for himself by its own nature...

573
00:34:07,634 --> 00:34:09,868
must hold innumerable stresses...

574
00:34:09,905 --> 00:34:12,103
full of countless compromises.

575
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:13,239
Compromises?

576
00:34:13,275 --> 00:34:14,302
Well, yes.

577
00:34:14,339 --> 00:34:15,603
What I mean is...

578
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:21,380
...once a man has set his heart and
soul on getting to a certain point...

579
00:34:21,417 --> 00:34:26,419
if he has to climb the crag,
he has to climb the crag.

580
00:34:26,456 --> 00:34:28,755
And if he has to walk
in the mire...

581
00:34:28,792 --> 00:34:31,054
Well?

582
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:34,210
Well then he has to walk,
my dear Gertrude, in the mire.

583
00:34:34,247 --> 00:34:37,330
Of course I'm only talking
in the most general terms and

584
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:39,963
on a subject about which
I know absolutely nothing.

585
00:34:39,999 --> 00:34:43,503
I always thought those were
your favourite subjects, Arthur.

586
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:47,708
Yes, indeed Indeed.

587
00:34:47,744 --> 00:34:49,240
Go on.

588
00:34:49,276 --> 00:34:50,707
Oh yes, no, umm...

589
00:34:50,744 --> 00:34:54,281
No but supposing, for instance,
a public figure, any public figure

590
00:34:54,317 --> 00:34:57,953
...Er, Lord Merton or my father
or Robert even say...

591
00:34:57,989 --> 00:35:01,589
had, years ago, written some
foolish letter to someone...

592
00:35:01,626 --> 00:35:03,555
what do you mean by
a foolish letter'?

593
00:35:03,591 --> 00:35:08,797
well, I mean a letter gravely
compromising one's position.

594
00:35:08,834 --> 00:35:12,031
I'm putting an imaginary case,
of course.

595
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:18,268
I cannot help but feel, Arthur, that
you are wanting to tell me something.

596
00:35:22,145 --> 00:35:26,616
What I really want to say,
dear Gertrude, is...

597
00:35:26,653 --> 00:35:31,053
that if for any reason
you are ever in trouble...

598
00:35:31,089 --> 00:35:35,492
come to me at once and know that
I will help you in every way I can.

599
00:35:35,529 --> 00:35:37,426
Lord Goring...

600
00:35:37,462 --> 00:35:41,095
you are talking quite seriously.

601
00:35:41,132 --> 00:35:44,001
Well, you must forgive me,
Lady Chiltern. It won't occur again.

602
00:35:44,037 --> 00:35:45,136
No, I like you to be serious.

603
00:35:45,173 --> 00:35:46,601
Gertrude?

604
00:35:46,637 --> 00:35:49,675
Please don't say such
dreadful things to Lord Goring.

605
00:35:49,711 --> 00:35:52,340
Seriousness would be
very unbecoming to him.

606
00:35:52,377 --> 00:35:54,943
Good morning, Lord Goring.
Pray be as trivial as you can.

607
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:58,651
Oh I should like to, but I'm afraid I'm
a little out of practice this morning.

608
00:35:58,687 --> 00:36:01,254
Besides,
I really ought to be going.

609
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:03,340
Oh, will you be there tonight?

610
00:36:03,377 --> 00:36:05,392
Well, I've received no invitation.

611
00:36:05,428 --> 00:36:08,559
Well, you have now.

612
00:36:08,595 --> 00:36:11,128
I'm sorry, Mabel, I'm not
in the mood for modern art.

613
00:36:11,165 --> 00:36:16,104
You don't mind, do you,
if Arthur escorts you in my place?

614
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,940
As long as he promises
not to be serious.

615
00:36:17,977 --> 00:36:19,705
For I have observed
a worrying trend.

616
00:36:19,741 --> 00:36:24,179
I swear on my life to be utterly
trivial and never to keep my word.

617
00:36:24,216 --> 00:36:25,514
In which case
I shall be delighted.

618
00:36:25,551 --> 00:36:27,546
In which case so shall I.

619
00:36:27,582 --> 00:36:29,541
My dear, Gertrude
thank you.

620
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,890
You will remember
what I said to you, won't you?

621
00:36:34,926 --> 00:36:37,659
Yes. But I still
don't know why you said it.

622
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:39,344
I hardly know myself.

623
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,992
Goodbye. Miss Mabel.

624
00:36:42,198 --> 00:36:43,495
Lord Goring?

625
00:36:45,168 --> 00:36:46,465
Lord Goring?

626
00:36:47,737 --> 00:36:51,140
What dreadful manners you have,
leaving just as I arrive.

627
00:36:51,177 --> 00:36:53,177
I'm sure you were
very badly brought up.

628
00:36:53,213 --> 00:36:54,107
Hmm, I was.

629
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:55,345
I wish I had brought you up.

630
00:36:55,381 --> 00:36:57,445
I'm sorry you didn't.

631
00:36:57,482 --> 00:36:59,631
It is too late now, I suppose?

632
00:36:59,668 --> 00:37:01,781
I shouldn't think so for a moment.

633
00:37:09,261 --> 00:37:10,990
So...

634
00:37:15,935 --> 00:37:16,965
So...

635
00:37:17,002 --> 00:37:19,183
Till tonight then.

636
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:21,366
Eight o'clock.

637
00:37:22,042 --> 00:37:23,600
Eight o'clock.

638
00:37:31,617 --> 00:37:35,612
So...

639
00:37:38,325 --> 00:37:40,089
My dear Sir Robert...

640
00:37:40,126 --> 00:37:44,599
I must confess to being not disappointed
to receive your letter of last night...

641
00:37:44,635 --> 00:37:47,566
and to learn that my proposition
held no interest for you.

642
00:37:47,602 --> 00:37:52,740
perhaps I failed to present it in
sufficiently attractive or persuasive terms.

643
00:37:52,777 --> 00:37:56,111
Another time perhaps
Yours sincerely...

644
00:37:56,147 --> 00:37:58,044
Laura Cheveley.

645
00:37:58,081 --> 00:38:01,080
Ps. If I should be
in the neighbourhood...

646
00:38:01,116 --> 00:38:04,283
I might just pay my respects
to your charming wife.

647
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,279
I wonder whether the matter
would be of any interest to her?

648
00:38:11,461 --> 00:38:12,759
Mrs. Cheveley?

649
00:38:13,997 --> 00:38:15,532
Won't you sit down?

650
00:38:15,568 --> 00:38:17,564
Thanks.

651
00:38:17,601 --> 00:38:18,465
And you know...

652
00:38:18,502 --> 00:38:22,138
I can't help feeling that
this disturbing new thing, this...

653
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:24,204
'Higher Education of Women'

654
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,907
will deal a terrible blow to
happy married life.

655
00:38:26,943 --> 00:38:29,446
The higher education of men is
what I should like to see.

656
00:38:29,483 --> 00:38:30,945
Men need it so sadly.

657
00:38:30,981 --> 00:38:34,485
They do, dear. But I'm afraid such
a scheme would be quite unpractical.

658
00:38:34,522 --> 00:38:37,288
I don't think man has much
capacity for development

659
00:38:37,325 --> 00:38:39,275
He's got as far as he can.

660
00:38:39,312 --> 00:38:41,190
And that's not far, is it?

661
00:38:41,226 --> 00:38:43,646
With regard to women, well,
dear Gertrude...

662
00:38:43,682 --> 00:38:46,029
modern women understand everything,
I'm told.

663
00:38:46,065 --> 00:38:50,269
Except their husbands. That is the one
thing the modern woman never understands.

664
00:38:50,305 --> 00:38:53,457
And a very good thing too, dear,
I dare say...

665
00:38:53,493 --> 00:38:56,609
it might break up many
a happy home if they did.

666
00:38:56,646 --> 00:38:59,846
Not yours, I need hardly say,
Gertrude.

667
00:38:59,883 --> 00:39:03,047
You have married
the perfect husband.

668
00:39:04,018 --> 00:39:06,837
And now, dear ladies,
I had better set forth.

669
00:39:06,874 --> 00:39:09,621
I haven't time to be
idling around here all day.

670
00:39:09,657 --> 00:39:13,494
I should be idling around somewhere
else very shortly or I shall fall behind.

671
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:16,560
No, no, I'll see myself out.

672
00:39:16,596 --> 00:39:21,336
No doubt you both have pleasant reminiscences
of your school days to talk together.

673
00:39:21,373 --> 00:39:22,066
Goodbye.

674
00:39:22,103 --> 00:39:23,297
Goodbye, my dear

675
00:39:29,011 --> 00:39:31,277
Wonderful woman, Lady Markby,
isn't she?

676
00:39:31,313 --> 00:39:34,383
Talks more and says less than
anybody I ever met.

677
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:36,401
Now, Gertrude.

678
00:39:36,438 --> 00:39:38,384
Mrs. Cheveley.

679
00:39:39,154 --> 00:39:43,761
I think it is right to tell you that I wish
you never to return to this house again.

680
00:39:43,797 --> 00:39:47,328
And never to attempt to
contact my husband.

681
00:39:47,365 --> 00:39:50,133
I see that after all these years
you've not changed a bit.

682
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:51,433
I hope I never will.

683
00:39:51,469 --> 00:39:53,104
Then life's taught you nothing?

684
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:54,368
It has taught me that

685
00:39:54,405 --> 00:39:58,476
a person who has once been guilty of
a dishonest and dishonorable action

686
00:39:58,513 --> 00:40:01,646
may be guilty of it
a second time and should be shunned.

687
00:40:01,683 --> 00:40:04,149
Would you apply that rule
to everyone?

688
00:40:04,186 --> 00:40:06,614
Yes. Without exception.

689
00:40:06,651 --> 00:40:08,653
Then I am sorry for you
Gertrude.

690
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:11,252
Very sorry for you.

691
00:40:11,289 --> 00:40:14,023
I thank you for your sympathy...

692
00:40:14,059 --> 00:40:17,995
but it is your departure
I would prefer.

693
00:40:19,264 --> 00:40:22,665
Do you know, Gertrude, I don't mind
you talking morality a bit.

694
00:40:22,701 --> 00:40:26,339
Morality is simply the attitude we adopt
towards people whom we personally dislike.

695
00:40:26,375 --> 00:40:28,608
You dislike me.
I am quite aware of that.

696
00:40:28,645 --> 00:40:30,741
And I have always detested you.

697
00:40:30,777 --> 00:40:34,248
And yet I have come here
to give you some advice.

698
00:40:34,284 --> 00:40:37,682
I hold your husband
in the hollow of my hand...

699
00:40:37,718 --> 00:40:41,356
and if you are wise you'll make him
do what I tell him.

700
00:40:41,392 --> 00:40:46,095
How dare you class my husband
with yourself?!

701
00:40:46,131 --> 00:40:48,159
Leave my house!

702
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:50,062
You are unfit to enter it!

703
00:40:50,098 --> 00:40:53,635
Your house? A house bought
with the price of dishonour?

704
00:40:53,672 --> 00:40:57,707
Everything in which has been
paid for by fraud.

705
00:40:57,743 --> 00:41:00,607
Ask him what the origin of
his fortune is.

706
00:41:00,643 --> 00:41:05,114
Get him to tell you how he sold
to a stockbroker a Cabinet secret.

707
00:41:05,151 --> 00:41:09,686
Learn from him to what
you owe your position.

708
00:41:09,722 --> 00:41:11,720
It is not true.

709
00:41:11,757 --> 00:41:13,187
Robert...

710
00:41:13,223 --> 00:41:15,214
tell her it is not true.

711
00:41:21,165 --> 00:41:22,757
Go.

712
00:41:25,002 --> 00:41:29,302
Go at once.
You've done your worst now.

713
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:39,318
Dear Sir Robert...

714
00:41:39,355 --> 00:41:40,450
Lady Chiltern...

715
00:41:40,486 --> 00:41:45,524
unless you meet my terms I think
you'll fine the worst is yet to come.

716
00:41:45,561 --> 00:41:48,585
You have until
half past ten tonight.

717
00:41:54,067 --> 00:41:56,434
Tell me it is not true.

718
00:41:59,506 --> 00:42:00,571
Let me explain...

719
00:42:00,607 --> 00:42:03,207
Tell me it is not true!

720
00:42:03,243 --> 00:42:05,112
Please. let me tell you,
please! Listen to me!

721
00:42:05,149 --> 00:42:06,747
No, don't come near me!
Don't touch me!

722
00:42:06,784 --> 00:42:07,750
Listen to me!

723
00:42:07,786 --> 00:42:08,680
How could you?!

724
00:42:08,716 --> 00:42:12,102
How could you do that, Robert?!

725
00:42:12,139 --> 00:42:14,815
You've lied to the whole world!

726
00:42:14,851 --> 00:42:17,455
You, you will not lie to me.

727
00:42:17,492 --> 00:42:19,538
Gertrude, please, I must tell you!

728
00:42:19,574 --> 00:42:21,585
No, don't say...
don't say anything!

729
00:42:27,403 --> 00:42:30,035
You were to me...

730
00:42:30,072 --> 00:42:33,543
something apart from common life.

731
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:38,379
A thing noble pure.

732
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:44,389
The world seemed to me
finer because you were in it.

733
00:42:44,425 --> 00:42:48,416
And goodness more real
because you lived...

734
00:42:54,332 --> 00:42:56,732
I'm... I'm sorry.

735
00:42:59,470 --> 00:43:01,404
So very sorry.

736
00:43:07,746 --> 00:43:11,807
I, I suppose I should go.

737
00:43:12,818 --> 00:43:13,615
Should I?

738
00:43:24,197 --> 00:43:26,188
Go.

739
00:43:29,036 --> 00:43:30,128
Get out!

740
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:18,689
Ah, my second button-hole.
Much better.

741
00:44:18,726 --> 00:44:19,220
And, do you know, Phipps...

742
00:44:19,257 --> 00:44:23,161
a really well made
button-hole is the only link...

743
00:44:23,198 --> 00:44:25,097
between art and nature.

744
00:44:25,133 --> 00:44:27,292
Yes, my Lord.

745
00:44:31,404 --> 00:44:34,601
I don't think
I quite like this one.

746
00:44:36,175 --> 00:44:38,675
Makes me look a little old.

747
00:44:38,712 --> 00:44:42,679
Makes me almost
in the prime of life?

748
00:44:42,715 --> 00:44:47,086
I don't observe any alteration
in your Lordship's appearance.

749
00:44:47,123 --> 00:44:48,855
You don't?

750
00:44:48,891 --> 00:44:50,588
No, my Lord.

751
00:44:52,659 --> 00:44:54,422
Hmm, very well.

752
00:45:00,301 --> 00:45:01,599
Oh my God!

753
00:45:01,636 --> 00:45:04,372
Father,
how delightful to see you.

754
00:45:04,409 --> 00:45:05,070
Take my cloak off.

755
00:45:05,106 --> 00:45:06,708
Er, is it really worthwhile,
father?

756
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:08,340
Of course it's worthwhile, sir.

757
00:45:08,377 --> 00:45:12,213
Ah, but you see I'm afraid I've recently
made a resolution not to have visitors...

758
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:14,750
on Thursday between er,
seven and nine in the evening.

759
00:45:14,786 --> 00:45:17,786
Glad to hear it.
Can't stand interruptions.

760
00:45:17,823 --> 00:45:19,288
No draught, I hope,
in this room.

761
00:45:19,325 --> 00:45:21,188
No, sir.

762
00:45:21,457 --> 00:45:23,358
I feel a draught, sir.
I feel it distinctly.

763
00:45:23,395 --> 00:45:24,458
So do I, sir.

764
00:45:24,494 --> 00:45:27,691
A dreadful draught, sir.
Why don't you go home?

765
00:45:28,198 --> 00:45:30,734
I will come and see you tomorrow and we
can talk about anything you like then.

766
00:45:30,771 --> 00:45:34,536
I have called this evening
with a definite purpose...

767
00:45:34,572 --> 00:45:38,075
and I'm going to see it through at all
cost to my health or yours.

768
00:45:38,111 --> 00:45:40,305
Put my cloak down, sir.

769
00:45:40,677 --> 00:45:42,444
I hate seeing things through,
father

770
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:46,016
especially when it's
through someone else's eyes.

771
00:45:46,053 --> 00:45:47,982
'Fraid I don't follow you there.
sir.

772
00:45:48,019 --> 00:45:50,283
Well, as far as I can make out, you
seem to follow me everywhere, father.

773
00:45:50,755 --> 00:45:51,745
I'll take that...

774
00:45:53,358 --> 00:45:55,123
Oh God!

775
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:56,795
Good evening, Arthur.

776
00:45:56,832 --> 00:45:57,760
My dear Robert.

777
00:45:57,796 --> 00:46:00,499
The fact is I really am
horribly busy tonight.

778
00:46:00,536 --> 00:46:03,435
But, Arthur,
I must speak with you.

779
00:46:04,604 --> 00:46:07,607
Gertrude has
discovered the truth?

780
00:46:07,644 --> 00:46:09,803
Yes, I'm afraid she has.

781
00:46:12,045 --> 00:46:14,444
Come in, Robert. Come in.

782
00:46:14,481 --> 00:46:16,714
But, if you wouldn't mind
waiting for a short while...

783
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:22,023
I'm afraid I'm right in the middle of
giving my performance of the attentive son.

784
00:46:22,059 --> 00:46:23,320
Oh, I'm sorry.

785
00:46:23,356 --> 00:46:24,582
Hmm, so am I.

786
00:46:27,562 --> 00:46:28,620
Phipps.

787
00:46:36,504 --> 00:46:37,470
God!

788
00:46:37,772 --> 00:46:41,743
When you left this afternoon
my life fell apart.

789
00:46:41,779 --> 00:46:43,913
My love is in ruins.

790
00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:46,011
I need you after all.

791
00:46:46,048 --> 00:46:49,142
I am coming to you now Gertrude.

792
00:46:49,718 --> 00:46:52,871
There is a lady coming to see me
this evening on particular business.

793
00:46:52,908 --> 00:46:56,026
Show her into the drawing room when
she arrives. Do you understand?

794
00:46:56,062 --> 00:46:57,123
Ah, yes, my Lord.

795
00:46:57,159 --> 00:46:59,196
This is a matter of
the gravest importance.

796
00:46:59,232 --> 00:47:00,561
I understand, my Lord.

797
00:47:00,598 --> 00:47:03,768
No one else is to be admitted
under any circumstances.

798
00:47:03,804 --> 00:47:04,803
Tell them I'm not at home.

799
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:05,802
I understand, my Lord.

800
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:07,073
Good.

801
00:47:07,109 --> 00:47:08,270
Arthur?

802
00:47:08,306 --> 00:47:09,637
Yes, father.

803
00:47:17,983 --> 00:47:20,076
Good evening, Phipps.

804
00:47:20,653 --> 00:47:23,485
How nice to see you again, madam.

805
00:47:29,028 --> 00:47:32,764
His Lordship is engaged at present
with Lord Caversham, madam.

806
00:47:32,801 --> 00:47:35,324
How very filial.

807
00:47:35,567 --> 00:47:38,601
His Lordship told me to ask you,
madam...

808
00:47:38,637 --> 00:47:42,675
Er, to be kind enough, Er,
to wait in the drawing room for him.

809
00:47:42,712 --> 00:47:44,644
His Lordship will come to you there.

810
00:47:44,681 --> 00:47:47,146
Lord Goring expects me?

811
00:47:47,183 --> 00:47:48,512
Yes, madam.

812
00:47:49,148 --> 00:47:50,647
Are you quite sure?

813
00:47:50,683 --> 00:47:55,190
His Lordship's directions
on the subject were very precise.

814
00:47:55,226 --> 00:47:58,159
No, I don't care for that lamp.
It is far too glaring.

815
00:47:58,195 --> 00:47:59,757
Light some candles.

816
00:47:59,794 --> 00:48:01,319
Certainly, madam.

817
00:48:02,430 --> 00:48:05,600
Marriage
is not a matter of affection...

818
00:48:05,637 --> 00:48:08,067
it is a question of common sense.

819
00:48:08,103 --> 00:48:12,308
Yes, but women who have common sense
are usually so curiously plain.

820
00:48:12,344 --> 00:48:14,507
Of course I'm only speaking
from hearsay.

821
00:48:14,544 --> 00:48:16,579
No woman, plain or pretty, has any
sense are so plain, aren't they, father.

822
00:48:16,616 --> 00:48:18,411
Common sense is a privilege
of our sex.

823
00:48:18,447 --> 00:48:22,252
Quite so and we men are so
self-sacrificing we never use it,

824
00:48:22,289 --> 00:48:23,250
do we, father?

825
00:48:23,287 --> 00:48:25,988
I use it, sir.
I use nothing else.

826
00:48:26,024 --> 00:48:27,254
Mum, so my mother tells me.

827
00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:30,157
It is the secret of
your mother's happiness.

828
00:48:30,526 --> 00:48:32,255
What was that?

829
00:48:34,231 --> 00:48:36,358
Nothing, father. Nothing.

830
00:48:37,067 --> 00:48:40,771
You are heartless, sir
Very heartless.

831
00:48:40,808 --> 00:48:43,036
Oh, I hope not, father.

832
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:53,511
When you left this afternoon
my life fell apart...

833
00:48:59,191 --> 00:49:02,650
I am coming to you now
Gertrude.

834
00:49:03,163 --> 00:49:05,154
There we are, madam.

835
00:49:11,171 --> 00:49:12,136
Thank you.

836
00:49:12,172 --> 00:49:13,401
Thank you, madam.

837
00:49:35,330 --> 00:49:39,664
I'm afraid His Lordship's not
at home this evening, milady.

838
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:44,470
I, I see.

839
00:49:44,507 --> 00:49:47,203
I'm sorry, Lady Chiltern.

840
00:49:48,044 --> 00:49:49,409
Not at all.

841
00:49:58,422 --> 00:50:00,652
...as you keep saying.

842
00:50:02,761 --> 00:50:04,294
Is in there?

843
00:50:04,330 --> 00:50:05,828
Yes, my Lord.

844
00:50:11,570 --> 00:50:13,332
Oh, my dear fellow.

845
00:50:13,671 --> 00:50:17,767
I'm sorry, Arthur,
I didn't know where else to go.

846
00:50:24,617 --> 00:50:27,313
I don't know what to do,
Arthur.

847
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:32,291
Robert, last night
you were telling me...

848
00:50:32,328 --> 00:50:34,527
how much Gertrude
means to you, hmm?

849
00:50:34,564 --> 00:50:37,060
How much you love her.

850
00:50:37,097 --> 00:50:39,156
More than anything
in the world.

851
00:50:40,367 --> 00:50:42,736
But there is a wide gulf
between us now...

852
00:50:42,773 --> 00:50:45,705
and I fear I shall never bridge it.

853
00:50:46,274 --> 00:50:48,440
I fear she will never forgive me.

854
00:50:48,476 --> 00:50:52,214
Surely there must be some sin in her
past life. Any sin...

855
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:54,650
weakness, perhaps, that might well...

856
00:50:54,686 --> 00:50:56,349
help her to understand yours.

857
00:50:56,385 --> 00:51:00,389
No, I don't believe Gertrude knows
what weakness or temptation is.

858
00:51:00,425 --> 00:51:04,010
But she loves you, Robert.
She cannot but forgive you.

859
00:51:04,047 --> 00:51:07,597
Now I feel certain
that if she could hear you now...

860
00:51:07,633 --> 00:51:10,266
the regret you feel about
your past...

861
00:51:10,302 --> 00:51:11,527
Regret?

862
00:51:13,268 --> 00:51:15,034
Yes, regret...

863
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:18,504
I feel certain that
she would pity you.

864
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:21,561
Perhaps even at this moment
she is pitying you.

865
00:51:21,597 --> 00:51:24,582
Praying that she might
once again be in your arms.

866
00:51:24,618 --> 00:51:27,380
God grant it but I doubt it.

867
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:32,112
There is something else
I need to tell you about.

868
00:51:32,723 --> 00:51:37,161
The debate on the Argentine canal
is to begin at ten thirty.

869
00:51:37,495 --> 00:51:40,693
I have made up my mind
what I'm going to say.

870
00:51:41,299 --> 00:51:44,166
I have decided...

871
00:51:49,075 --> 00:51:50,269
What was that?

872
00:51:51,377 --> 00:51:52,742
Nothing.

873
00:51:53,646 --> 00:51:56,083
I heard a noise from next door.

874
00:51:56,119 --> 00:51:58,142
No, no you didn't.

875
00:52:01,822 --> 00:52:03,620
Is there someone there?

876
00:52:04,892 --> 00:52:05,722
Arthur?

877
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:07,824
Robert... you're excited,
unnerved.

878
00:52:07,861 --> 00:52:11,165
There is no-one in that room. Now
sit down, old man, for God's sake!

879
00:52:11,201 --> 00:52:12,466
Do you give me
your word of honor?

880
00:52:12,503 --> 00:52:14,093
Oh, yes!

881
00:52:17,372 --> 00:52:19,039
Let me look for myself.

882
00:52:19,076 --> 00:52:19,670
Oh, Robert...

883
00:52:19,707 --> 00:52:21,376
If there is no-one there
then why shouldn't I look?

884
00:52:21,413 --> 00:52:25,176
Robert... there is someone
in that room.

885
00:52:29,285 --> 00:52:30,683
My dear fellow,
I do apologise but

886
00:52:30,719 --> 00:52:34,356
I must state she's entirely
guiltless in this matter.

887
00:52:34,393 --> 00:52:38,795
She is scheming
devious and deceitful.

888
00:52:38,831 --> 00:52:39,828
I beg your pardon?

889
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:42,127
And you...

890
00:52:43,133 --> 00:52:46,203
you are false as a friend
... and treacherous.

891
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:46,800
Robert!

892
00:52:46,836 --> 00:52:48,736
Good evening, Lord Goring.

893
00:52:49,407 --> 00:52:50,840
Sir Robert.

894
00:52:51,409 --> 00:52:54,708
So tell me, Goring, how the devil do
you explain her presence here?

895
00:52:57,583 --> 00:52:59,181
To be quite honest, I can't I...

896
00:52:59,218 --> 00:53:01,716
I take you two have been
planning this for some time.

897
00:53:01,752 --> 00:53:04,489
Look, Robert believes me, we have
not. We have never planned anything.

898
00:53:04,525 --> 00:53:06,488
Except marriage, of course,
Lord Goring.

899
00:53:06,524 --> 00:53:10,262
Come now, Arthur, you can't have forgotten
we were engaged for at least three weeks.

900
00:53:10,298 --> 00:53:11,860
Yes, but...

901
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:15,634
At this moment I find it hard to see why
on earth you broke it off. You seem to be...

902
00:53:15,671 --> 00:53:17,669
entirely well suited to each other.

903
00:53:17,706 --> 00:53:19,239
Robert, I give you my word...

904
00:53:19,275 --> 00:53:20,671
No, sir.

905
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:23,308
Oh no, sir.

906
00:53:25,211 --> 00:53:30,047
You have lied enough upon your
word of honor.

907
00:53:34,655 --> 00:53:37,522
I appear to have caused
something of a commotion.

908
00:53:42,062 --> 00:53:43,325
Goodnight, Sir Robert.

909
00:53:58,747 --> 00:54:04,787
You've come here to sell me
Robert Chiltern's letter.

910
00:54:04,823 --> 00:54:06,789
To offer it to you on condition.

911
00:54:06,826 --> 00:54:09,155
How did you guess?

912
00:54:09,458 --> 00:54:12,094
What is your price for it?

913
00:54:12,131 --> 00:54:13,627
My price...

914
00:54:13,664 --> 00:54:17,031
I've arrived
at the romantic stage.

915
00:54:17,634 --> 00:54:21,188
When I saw you the other night
at the Chilterns'...

916
00:54:21,224 --> 00:54:24,742
I knew you were the only person
I'd ever cared for.

917
00:54:24,778 --> 00:54:28,646
If I've ever cared for anybody,
Arthur.

918
00:54:28,683 --> 00:54:30,239
So...

919
00:54:32,184 --> 00:54:35,853
on the morning
of the day that you marry me...

920
00:54:35,890 --> 00:54:39,187
I will give you
Robert Chiltern's letter.

921
00:54:41,327 --> 00:54:43,158
That is my offer.

922
00:54:46,198 --> 00:54:47,634
Are you quite serious?

923
00:54:47,671 --> 00:54:48,666
Yes.

924
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:50,465
Quite serious.

925
00:54:51,103 --> 00:54:54,699
My dear Mrs. Cheveley.

926
00:54:55,475 --> 00:54:57,877
I'm afraid I should make you
a very bad husband.

927
00:54:57,914 --> 00:55:00,614
I don't mind bad husbands,
I've had two

928
00:55:00,650 --> 00:55:03,081
They amuse me immensely.

929
00:55:03,883 --> 00:55:08,421
Here is a chance to rise to great
heights of self-sacrifice, Arthur.

930
00:55:08,458 --> 00:55:10,220
I think you should.

931
00:55:10,257 --> 00:55:14,196
And the rest of your life you could spend
in contemplating your own perfections.

932
00:55:14,232 --> 00:55:16,328
I do that as it is.

933
00:55:16,365 --> 00:55:18,229
For the privilege of
being your wife...

934
00:55:18,266 --> 00:55:23,466
I am ready to sacrifice the greatest
prize in my possession.

935
00:55:27,343 --> 00:55:28,640
I'm honored.

936
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:35,349
Arthur...

937
00:55:35,385 --> 00:55:39,390
you loved me once
you asked me to be your wife...

938
00:55:39,426 --> 00:55:41,521
ask me again.

939
00:55:41,558 --> 00:55:43,616
Ask me now.

940
00:55:50,167 --> 00:55:51,759
Bonsoir.

941
00:56:00,779 --> 00:56:02,827
My dear Mrs. Cheveley.

942
00:56:02,863 --> 00:56:04,875
My dear Lord Goring.

943
00:56:08,386 --> 00:56:11,054
Now I'm going to give you
some good advice.

944
00:56:11,090 --> 00:56:13,526
Pray, don't. One should never give a woman
anything she can't wear in the evening.

945
00:56:13,563 --> 00:56:16,195
Oh, I'm sorry but I don't seem
to be able to stop myself.

946
00:56:16,232 --> 00:56:20,384
Now, I'm going to tell you...
that love...

947
00:56:20,421 --> 00:56:24,501
about which I admit I know
so little...

948
00:56:24,538 --> 00:56:28,372
love cannot be bought.
It can only be given.

949
00:56:28,409 --> 00:56:32,613
And I sense it is not
in my power to give to you.

950
00:56:32,649 --> 00:56:37,219
And nor is it in yours I suspect...

951
00:56:37,255 --> 00:56:37,716
at all.

952
00:56:37,753 --> 00:56:41,687
Dear boy,
you underestimate us both.

953
00:56:43,357 --> 00:56:45,588
To give...

954
00:56:46,227 --> 00:56:49,694
and not expect return, hmm?

955
00:56:49,731 --> 00:56:53,532
That is what lies
at the heart of love.

956
00:56:53,569 --> 00:56:58,474
I fear though the notion
is a stranger to us both.

957
00:56:58,511 --> 00:57:00,306
And yet...

958
00:57:00,343 --> 00:57:02,108
if we are honest...

959
00:57:02,145 --> 00:57:05,279
it is something we both long for

960
00:57:05,315 --> 00:57:10,184
something that it takes
great courage to do.

961
00:57:10,553 --> 00:57:16,390
Yes that is our dark secret.

962
00:57:16,427 --> 00:57:20,489
Your coming here tonight is
the first whisper of it.

963
00:57:21,065 --> 00:57:24,126
And for that I admire you.

964
00:57:24,469 --> 00:57:26,768
Give me the letter.

965
00:57:27,239 --> 00:57:33,246
Prove your affections to me
and give me the letter.

966
00:57:33,282 --> 00:57:37,045
And surrender my position
of power?

967
00:57:37,315 --> 00:57:40,652
The future of a great man is
in your hands, Mrs. Cheveley.

968
00:57:40,689 --> 00:57:44,691
Crush him and your power dies
with him...

969
00:57:44,727 --> 00:57:48,694
as will any feeling
I've ever had for you.

970
00:57:48,731 --> 00:57:50,787
If you ever loved me...

971
00:57:54,735 --> 00:57:56,327
I did love you.

972
00:57:56,637 --> 00:57:59,505
I know, I know.

973
00:58:05,747 --> 00:58:07,544
But not that much.

974
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:14,111
I know, I must admit
I never thought you did.

975
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:17,423
Even so, I felt it worth a try.

976
00:58:17,459 --> 00:58:20,663
I understand and respect
you all the more for the attempt.

977
00:58:20,699 --> 00:58:22,996
And I take it you reject
my offer?

978
00:58:23,032 --> 00:58:29,404
I fear I must when tempting
as it seems... in truth...

979
00:58:30,607 --> 00:58:32,409
...it is little
more than blackmail.

980
00:58:32,445 --> 00:58:33,739
True.

981
00:58:42,252 --> 00:58:43,787
Gertrude!

982
00:58:43,824 --> 00:58:45,287
Mabel.

983
00:58:45,323 --> 00:58:48,292
I suddenly remembered
you were due to meet Arthur.

984
00:58:48,329 --> 00:58:50,941
Oh,
at least somebody remembered.

985
00:58:50,977 --> 00:58:53,553
You mean he's not here either?

986
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:56,699
Oh strange.

987
00:58:57,269 --> 00:58:59,271
Gertrude, are you quite well?

988
00:58:59,308 --> 00:59:01,296
Me? Yes, of course

989
00:59:02,842 --> 00:59:04,833
No, I'm not at all.

990
00:59:07,112 --> 00:59:08,477
Could we talk?

991
00:59:08,781 --> 00:59:11,534
Everything I have ever learned,
indeed all that I believe,

992
00:59:11,571 --> 00:59:14,287
leads me to reject and revile
him for what he has done.

993
00:59:14,324 --> 00:59:15,490
And yet...

994
00:59:15,526 --> 00:59:16,620
And yet?

995
00:59:16,656 --> 00:59:22,129
...I have never known such joy
as when I'm with him.

996
00:59:22,166 --> 00:59:24,696
I've never felt so...

997
00:59:24,732 --> 00:59:28,566
free as when I'm lying in his arms.

998
00:59:31,205 --> 00:59:33,975
Well, Arthur, I shall look out
for you at the Commons...

999
00:59:34,012 --> 00:59:36,745
where at least I'll see your friend
submit to my desires.

1000
00:59:36,781 --> 00:59:38,309
I wouldn't be too sure.

1001
00:59:38,346 --> 00:59:41,546
Come now, we both know how dearly
he values his career.

1002
00:59:41,583 --> 00:59:43,585
I look froward to him proving
you wrong I anticipate it keenly.

1003
00:59:43,621 --> 00:59:48,123
In fact, I'd stake my shirt on it.

1004
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:49,355
Your shirt?

1005
00:59:49,391 --> 00:59:53,329
Indeed I think I'd probably wager
my entire wardrobe on his integrity.

1006
00:59:53,366 --> 00:59:55,195
What confidence.

1007
00:59:55,231 --> 00:59:57,598
Would you stake your liberty?

1008
00:59:58,335 --> 00:59:59,802
My liberty?

1009
01:00:00,504 --> 01:00:03,341
A rather charming little idea
has sprung into my head...

1010
01:00:03,377 --> 01:00:04,739
and now I consider it,

1011
01:00:04,776 --> 01:00:08,711
I discover it to be
a rather charming, big idea.

1012
01:00:09,247 --> 01:00:10,544
Go on.

1013
01:00:11,215 --> 01:00:15,417
If as you suggest,
he stands by his principles...

1014
01:00:15,453 --> 01:00:18,657
condemns the scheme in question,
then shall I give you his letter.

1015
01:00:18,693 --> 01:00:21,591
...to dispose of as you choose.

1016
01:00:21,628 --> 01:00:23,458
But if as I project...

1017
01:00:23,495 --> 01:00:27,231
he surrenders to my demands,
and publicly supports the scheme

1018
01:00:27,268 --> 01:00:28,721
then...

1019
01:00:29,233 --> 01:00:31,203
then shall I give you my hand
in marriage.

1020
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:32,502
Precisely.

1021
01:00:32,538 --> 01:00:33,870
To dispose of as you please.

1022
01:00:33,906 --> 01:00:38,661
As a better man, you must concede
there is a certain thrill to it.

1023
01:00:38,697 --> 01:00:43,416
Concede too how elegantly I've eased
from proposal to proposition.

1024
01:00:43,453 --> 01:00:46,553
And with barely any loss of face.
I'm most impressed indeed.

1025
01:00:46,590 --> 01:00:49,682
We are creatures of compromise,
you and I.

1026
01:00:50,658 --> 01:00:54,562
I await your response. You're all of a sudden
less certain of your friend's true nature...

1027
01:00:54,599 --> 01:00:57,554
when your own future
rests upon it.

1028
01:00:59,166 --> 01:01:02,504
Not at all I accept
your wager in all confidence.

1029
01:01:02,541 --> 01:01:04,091
You do?

1030
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:05,604
I do.

1031
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:07,173
Oh, Arthur...

1032
01:01:07,210 --> 01:01:11,408
isn't it remarkable how those two
little words can quicken the heart?

1033
01:01:12,749 --> 01:01:17,249
Would you do something for me,
Gertrude?

1034
01:01:17,286 --> 01:01:19,285
Would you accompany me to
the House of Commons?

1035
01:01:19,321 --> 01:01:23,075
I believe there is a rather
interesting debate there tonight.

1036
01:01:23,111 --> 01:01:26,829
I believe the Prime Minister
himself has taken an interest.

1037
01:01:26,865 --> 01:01:29,229
And I believe...

1038
01:01:29,266 --> 01:01:33,303
that its outcome will prove
particularly interesting to you.

1039
01:01:33,339 --> 01:01:34,793
And to me.

1040
01:01:36,573 --> 01:01:38,564
Whatever it may be.

1041
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:56,420
Damn!

1042
01:02:16,316 --> 01:02:20,788
The Honourable Member
for Witney.

1043
01:02:20,824 --> 01:02:22,423
Good evening, Chiltern.

1044
01:02:22,459 --> 01:02:24,121
Prime Minister.

1045
01:02:24,157 --> 01:02:26,590
I beg to ask the President of
the Board of Trade...

1046
01:02:26,627 --> 01:02:30,832
to what extent he believes
the projected Argentine Canal...

1047
01:02:30,869 --> 01:02:34,564
merits the nation's attention
and support.

1048
01:02:35,870 --> 01:02:37,668
Mr. Speaker...

1049
01:02:42,311 --> 01:02:45,098
I believe this excellent scheme...

1050
01:02:45,134 --> 01:02:47,460
represents a genuine opportunity...

1051
01:02:47,496 --> 01:02:49,750
to extend our trading routes...

1052
01:02:49,786 --> 01:02:54,625
and to stamp our authority
on an increasingly vital...

1053
01:02:54,662 --> 01:02:57,287
portion of the globe.

1054
01:03:02,666 --> 01:03:04,667
Didn't expect to see you here.

1055
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:10,231
Nor did I. But I find I have developed a
sudden and very singular interest in politics.

1056
01:03:10,541 --> 01:03:12,202
Married yet?

1057
01:03:12,743 --> 01:03:14,678
Ask me again in half an hour.

1058
01:03:17,215 --> 01:03:18,650
What?

1059
01:03:18,687 --> 01:03:20,049
Nothing.

1060
01:03:20,085 --> 01:03:21,319
The Honourable Member
for Cheltenham.

1061
01:03:21,355 --> 01:03:22,518
Arthur...?

1062
01:03:22,555 --> 01:03:26,441
I beg to ask the Under Secretary
for Foreign Affairs...

1063
01:03:26,478 --> 01:03:30,329
to clarify his position
in respect to the proposed scheme.

1064
01:03:30,365 --> 01:03:31,887
Answer.

1065
01:03:35,101 --> 01:03:37,200
Let me first of all thank the...

1066
01:03:37,237 --> 01:03:41,469
Honourable Member for his articulate
contribution to the debate.

1067
01:03:43,611 --> 01:03:47,148
Since I last adressed the House
on this subject...

1068
01:03:47,184 --> 01:03:50,685
I have had the opportunity
to investigate this scheme...

1069
01:03:50,722 --> 01:03:52,618
more thoroughly...

1070
01:03:52,654 --> 01:03:58,183
and to grasp fully the ramifications
of our lending it support.

1071
01:04:00,629 --> 01:04:03,689
I have to inform the House...

1072
01:04:04,199 --> 01:04:06,166
that I was...

1073
01:04:06,401 --> 01:04:08,232
mistaken...

1074
01:04:09,338 --> 01:04:11,806
in my original perceptions...

1075
01:04:12,241 --> 01:04:14,869
and that I have now taken
a rather different view.

1076
01:04:28,893 --> 01:04:31,625
I, I find that now
I must agree with...

1077
01:04:31,662 --> 01:04:37,869
my Right Honourable Friend that
this is indeed an excellent scheme.

1078
01:04:37,905 --> 01:04:41,167
A genuine... opportunity.

1079
01:04:44,109 --> 01:04:45,408
An opportunity...

1080
01:04:45,444 --> 01:04:49,244
particularly if you happen
to be a corrupt investor...

1081
01:04:54,388 --> 01:04:56,285
a corrupt investor...

1082
01:04:56,321 --> 01:05:00,349
with nothing but self-interest
at heart.

1083
01:05:03,329 --> 01:05:06,766
For now it is my utter conviction
that this scheme never should have had...

1084
01:05:06,803 --> 01:05:10,471
or should ever have
any chance of success.

1085
01:05:10,508 --> 01:05:14,105
It is a fraud
an infamous fraud at that.

1086
01:05:14,141 --> 01:05:19,374
Our involvement would be a political
fraud of the worst possible kind.

1087
01:05:22,349 --> 01:05:26,251
This great nation...

1088
01:05:26,287 --> 01:05:29,455
has long been
a great commercial power.

1089
01:05:29,492 --> 01:05:34,096
Now it seems there exists a growing
compulsion to use that power...

1090
01:05:34,133 --> 01:05:36,729
merely to beget more power.

1091
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:41,201
Money merely to beget
more money...

1092
01:05:41,238 --> 01:05:45,174
irrespective of the true
cost to the nation's soul.

1093
01:05:45,211 --> 01:05:49,076
And it is this sickness,
a kind of moral blindness...

1094
01:05:49,112 --> 01:05:55,452
...commerce without conscience, which threatens
to strike at the very soul of this nation.

1095
01:05:55,488 --> 01:05:59,549
And the only remedy that I can see
is to strike back and to strike now!

1096
01:06:02,126 --> 01:06:07,429
Hear, hear!

1097
01:06:09,834 --> 01:06:14,573
As we stand as we stand
at the end of this most...

1098
01:06:14,610 --> 01:06:17,173
eventful century...

1099
01:06:17,209 --> 01:06:20,512
it seems that we do,
after all, have...

1100
01:06:20,549 --> 01:06:22,745
...a genuine opportunity.

1101
01:06:22,781 --> 01:06:27,120
One honest chance to shed our...

1102
01:06:27,156 --> 01:06:30,590
sometimes imperfect past...

1103
01:06:30,627 --> 01:06:32,456
to start again...

1104
01:06:32,492 --> 01:06:36,464
to step unshackled
into the next century...

1105
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:40,901
and to look our future squarely...

1106
01:06:40,937 --> 01:06:44,895
and proudly in the face.

1107
01:06:47,575 --> 01:06:51,739
Order!

1108
01:06:54,348 --> 01:06:56,782
Gentlemen, if you please! Order!

1109
01:06:58,855 --> 01:07:00,584
Order!

1110
01:07:09,232 --> 01:07:12,666
You must agree, it has been
a romantic interlude, Arthur.

1111
01:07:12,702 --> 01:07:18,107
You might even confess to some faint
and secret regret at its outcome.

1112
01:07:18,408 --> 01:07:22,247
For I do indeed feel some slight
relief that in the end...

1113
01:07:22,283 --> 01:07:23,414
...Sir Robert has come to no harm.

1114
01:07:23,450 --> 01:07:24,579
Really?

1115
01:07:24,616 --> 01:07:29,120
Oh yes, you see I'm not really
quite as wicked as you suppose.

1116
01:07:29,157 --> 01:07:30,587
Mrs. Cheveley!

1117
01:07:30,889 --> 01:07:34,587
And a lady must always honour
her bets.

1118
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:37,522
Come back with me, Arthur.

1119
01:07:40,432 --> 01:07:42,525
Come back to Vienna.

1120
01:07:44,570 --> 01:07:46,702
Bravo, Sir Robert.

1121
01:07:46,739 --> 01:07:48,707
Seems I underestimated you.

1122
01:07:48,743 --> 01:07:49,371
Robert.

1123
01:07:49,408 --> 01:07:51,277
I'm sorry if I've spoiled
your plans.

1124
01:07:51,314 --> 01:07:52,742
Far more than yet you realize.

1125
01:07:52,778 --> 01:07:54,847
Ah, there at least is
some small satisfaction.

1126
01:07:54,884 --> 01:07:56,312
Look, Robert, my dear fellow...

1127
01:07:56,349 --> 01:07:58,442
I have nothing to say to you,
Lord Goring.

1128
01:07:59,152 --> 01:08:01,383
Nor is there anything
I wish to hear.

1129
01:08:14,735 --> 01:08:18,171
I hope that now you are content...

1130
01:08:18,473 --> 01:08:20,676
that I didn't disappoint you.

1131
01:08:20,713 --> 01:08:21,606
Robert, I...

1132
01:08:21,643 --> 01:08:24,177
Let women make
no more ideals of men...

1133
01:08:24,214 --> 01:08:27,817
or they may ruin other lives
as completely as you.

1134
01:08:27,853 --> 01:08:30,586
You whom I have loved
so wildly...

1135
01:08:30,623 --> 01:08:32,889
have surely ruined mine.

1136
01:08:32,926 --> 01:08:34,254
Robert...

1137
01:08:35,425 --> 01:08:37,893
I know there is no hope for us now.

1138
01:08:39,262 --> 01:08:41,594
I know you can never forgive me.

1139
01:08:43,900 --> 01:08:47,737
Poor man I almost begin
to feel sorry for him.

1140
01:08:47,774 --> 01:08:48,870
Sorry?

1141
01:08:48,906 --> 01:08:53,410
Yes, I can't bear to see so upright a
gentleman, so honourable an English gentleman...

1142
01:08:53,447 --> 01:08:55,746
being so shamefully deceived.

1143
01:08:55,783 --> 01:08:56,844
Deceived?

1144
01:08:56,881 --> 01:08:59,547
And on such positively pink paper.

1145
01:08:59,584 --> 01:09:02,383
What are you talking about,
Mrs. Cheveley?

1146
01:09:02,419 --> 01:09:05,182
"I need you after all
I'm coming to you now."

1147
01:09:06,325 --> 01:09:08,757
You stole Gertrude's letter?

1148
01:09:08,793 --> 01:09:11,694
Losing a man is scant cause
for concern...

1149
01:09:11,731 --> 01:09:14,096
but losing a man to her is
another matter entirely.

1150
01:09:14,133 --> 01:09:17,870
And so I feel it only right that Sir
Robert should know, as indeed he shall...

1151
01:09:17,907 --> 01:09:22,365
when the letter arrives at
his office first thing in the morning.

1152
01:09:25,412 --> 01:09:27,381
You've got a good man there,
Gertrude.

1153
01:09:27,417 --> 01:09:29,383
You should try to hold on to him.

1154
01:09:29,420 --> 01:09:30,314
Do you know, Laura...

1155
01:09:30,351 --> 01:09:34,582
it occurs to me this whole business
is really just about you and me.

1156
01:09:39,893 --> 01:09:41,645
Gertrude, I must speak with you.

1157
01:09:41,681 --> 01:09:43,362
Er, er, not now. Arthur.
Please!

1158
01:09:43,398 --> 01:09:46,013
Gertrude, it's about that letter.
The letter you wrote to me!

1159
01:09:46,050 --> 01:09:48,629
...do come round in the morning,
Arthur, I can't talk now.

1160
01:09:49,872 --> 01:09:51,270
Lord Goring?

1161
01:09:54,209 --> 01:09:55,369
Miss Mabel...

1162
01:09:55,711 --> 01:09:56,812
about this evening, I...

1163
01:09:56,849 --> 01:09:58,405
congratulations.

1164
01:09:59,615 --> 01:10:00,847
I beg your pardon?

1165
01:10:00,883 --> 01:10:02,883
I gather you are to
be congratulated.

1166
01:10:02,919 --> 01:10:06,552
Well naturally... there's nothing
I like more than to be congratulated...

1167
01:10:06,589 --> 01:10:11,329
though invariably I find the pleasure
immeasurably increased by knowing what for.

1168
01:10:11,365 --> 01:10:14,799
Oh, haven't you heard?
You're to be married.

1169
01:10:14,836 --> 01:10:15,933
Your father says...

1170
01:10:15,969 --> 01:10:16,797
Does he?

1171
01:10:16,834 --> 01:10:18,462
Yes, he does.

1172
01:10:19,670 --> 01:10:22,230
Did he, by any chance,
tell you to who?

1173
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:24,139
No.

1174
01:10:24,175 --> 01:10:26,578
But when we saw you with
that woman Mrs. Cheeseley

1175
01:10:26,615 --> 01:10:27,879
we naturally assumed...

1176
01:10:27,915 --> 01:10:29,381
Oh, did we?

1177
01:10:29,418 --> 01:10:30,812
Yes, we did.

1178
01:10:30,849 --> 01:10:33,348
Well the fact is...

1179
01:10:33,385 --> 01:10:36,621
your assumptions
are presumptuous.

1180
01:10:36,657 --> 01:10:38,419
You see...

1181
01:10:39,659 --> 01:10:42,692
I'm not sure...

1182
01:10:42,729 --> 01:10:45,965
that I've seen anything
I quite like the look of yet.

1183
01:10:46,001 --> 01:10:48,081
Oh, really?

1184
01:10:48,117 --> 01:10:50,161
Mum, really.

1185
01:10:50,503 --> 01:10:54,531
In which case I have something
vitally important to say to you.

1186
01:10:56,410 --> 01:11:01,746
To look at a thing is quite
different form seeing a thing.

1187
01:11:02,182 --> 01:11:07,712
And one does not see anything
until one sees its beauty.

1188
01:11:09,724 --> 01:11:12,421
Yes. Really.

1189
01:11:16,698 --> 01:11:18,496
Oh, Mabel

1190
01:11:21,203 --> 01:11:25,401
Do you have something you wish
to say to me, Lord Goring?

1191
01:11:28,878 --> 01:11:34,283
...no, no I don't think so.

1192
01:11:38,855 --> 01:11:41,255
Then I don't wish to hear it.

1193
01:11:41,825 --> 01:11:43,391
Goodnight.

1194
01:11:43,428 --> 01:11:46,830
I'm sure that nice Mr. Trafford
will have something to say to me.

1195
01:11:46,867 --> 01:11:48,628
And I'm even surer...

1196
01:11:49,300 --> 01:11:51,791
I will be quite charmed to listen!

1197
01:11:59,478 --> 01:12:00,274
Damn!

1198
01:12:09,856 --> 01:12:12,587
It is a great nuisance.

1199
01:12:15,362 --> 01:12:19,397
Can't find anyone else to talk to and
I'm so full of interesting information.

1200
01:12:19,450 --> 01:12:23,047
I feel like the latest
edition of something or other.

1201
01:12:24,538 --> 01:12:25,903
Well...

1202
01:12:26,406 --> 01:12:28,705
after some consideration...

1203
01:12:29,443 --> 01:12:31,241
there's so much to do

1204
01:12:31,278 --> 01:12:33,769
there's only one thing to be done.

1205
01:12:35,449 --> 01:12:39,921
There comes a time in every
son's life when he must, indeed...

1206
01:12:39,957 --> 01:12:42,617
follow his father's advice.

1207
01:12:44,426 --> 01:12:46,257
I shall go to bed at once.

1208
01:12:49,799 --> 01:12:53,269
I do hope we see you in the near
future, Mrs. Cheveley.

1209
01:12:53,306 --> 01:12:56,740
Oh, so do I. But I fear,
Lady Markby, that for me...

1210
01:12:56,776 --> 01:12:59,276
the future seems
strangely uncertain.

1211
01:12:59,312 --> 01:13:02,710
And what of the present?

1212
01:13:02,746 --> 01:13:04,781
Well, as a very dear friend once said
to me, "To love oneself...

1213
01:13:04,818 --> 01:13:07,651
is the beginning of
a lifelong romance".

1214
01:13:07,687 --> 01:13:09,620
Goodbye, dear Lady Markby.

1215
01:13:13,423 --> 01:13:16,427
London will be the lesser
for your leaving.

1216
01:13:16,463 --> 01:13:18,663
And sadly lacking in scandal.

1217
01:13:18,700 --> 01:13:20,828
Ah, but my dear Lady Markby...

1218
01:13:20,865 --> 01:13:24,235
my personal favourite
is shortly to unfold.

1219
01:13:24,272 --> 01:13:25,793
Consider it a parting gift.

1220
01:13:26,471 --> 01:13:27,939
Thank you, Mrs. Cheveley.

1221
01:14:07,883 --> 01:14:09,316
May I see it?

1222
01:14:21,530 --> 01:14:26,867
...that is what you were doing
with that woman, Mrs. Cheveley.

1223
01:14:29,872 --> 01:14:31,909
Well it certainly
didn't look that way.

1224
01:14:31,945 --> 01:14:32,607
Ah yes,

1225
01:14:32,643 --> 01:14:37,273
but there's a great deal of difference between
looking and seeing Isn't there, Miss Mabel?

1226
01:14:40,619 --> 01:14:42,677
Oh, my dear Arthur.

1227
01:14:43,654 --> 01:14:46,522
What a good friend you are
to him.

1228
01:14:46,825 --> 01:14:48,190
To us.

1229
01:14:48,226 --> 01:14:51,126
But the truth is we're not out of
danger yet. In fact...

1230
01:14:51,163 --> 01:14:55,195
I believe there's a rather popular
saying about frying pans and fires...

1231
01:14:55,231 --> 01:14:59,226
only this time it is you and I,
dear Gertrude, who are to be roasted.

1232
01:15:03,341 --> 01:15:05,277
Oh no, Arthur, I, I couldn't.

1233
01:15:05,313 --> 01:15:05,874
No, I couldn't.

1234
01:15:05,911 --> 01:15:08,215
I think it is better that
he should know the exact truth.

1235
01:15:08,251 --> 01:15:12,185
So you want me to tell him that
what?

1236
01:15:12,221 --> 01:15:15,155
That I intended a...

1237
01:15:15,191 --> 01:15:15,752
secret...

1238
01:15:15,789 --> 01:15:17,120
a secret rendezvous. Yes.

1239
01:15:17,157 --> 01:15:19,159
With a single man?
And at such an hour?

1240
01:15:19,196 --> 01:15:20,927
You, you want me to tell him that?

1241
01:15:20,963 --> 01:15:22,493
It's scandalous, Arthur!

1242
01:15:22,530 --> 01:15:26,300
Well that may be but it's also the truth
and in this case it may be our best option.

1243
01:15:26,336 --> 01:15:28,703
But I'm a married woman.
I couldn't possibly tell him.

1244
01:15:28,740 --> 01:15:29,737
Well then, may I do it?

1245
01:15:29,773 --> 01:15:31,335
Certainly not!

1246
01:15:31,372 --> 01:15:34,576
And you must give me your word,
Arthur, that you never will.

1247
01:15:34,612 --> 01:15:36,168
No, you are wrong, Gertrude!

1248
01:15:38,814 --> 01:15:40,513
But I will give you my word.

1249
01:15:40,549 --> 01:15:43,419
That you will never tell me what...

1250
01:15:43,455 --> 01:15:44,818
Lord Goring?

1251
01:15:45,488 --> 01:15:46,614
Robert.

1252
01:15:51,695 --> 01:15:53,253
What does this mean?

1253
01:15:57,734 --> 01:16:01,438
I, Robert, I, I meant to give
it to you last night But...

1254
01:16:01,475 --> 01:16:02,700
Last night?

1255
01:16:04,442 --> 01:16:07,978
Yes, when Gertrude sent it over
but you left in such a hurry...

1256
01:16:08,014 --> 01:16:09,643
Oh, then, then...

1257
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:11,079
so this letter is intended
for me?

1258
01:16:14,660 --> 01:16:15,494
Well, of co...

1259
01:16:17,997 --> 01:16:19,248
Oh my goodness...

1260
01:16:19,352 --> 01:16:23,287
you didn't think, you couldn't
possibly think that, you know...

1261
01:16:25,363 --> 01:16:27,329
The name, the, um...

1262
01:16:27,366 --> 01:16:30,392
the address on the envelope
is yours...

1263
01:16:31,170 --> 01:16:34,407
She knew that when you left here you
would come to me at once, obviously.

1264
01:16:34,443 --> 01:16:36,534
Well, it stands to reason old man,
come on.

1265
01:16:39,946 --> 01:16:41,848
It's true, Robert.

1266
01:16:41,884 --> 01:16:43,750
I delivered it myself.

1267
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:50,190
You did? You did.

1268
01:16:50,227 --> 01:16:51,783
Certainly.

1269
01:16:54,294 --> 01:16:59,567
As you will remember, Gertrude after
my rehearsals I called in for tea.

1270
01:16:59,603 --> 01:17:02,166
And, when you mentioned
the letter...

1271
01:17:02,203 --> 01:17:05,875
I remarked that I was shortly to meet up
with Lord Goring as we had an appointment...

1272
01:17:05,911 --> 01:17:08,511
to visit the new Modern Art
exhibition at the Grosvenor...

1273
01:17:08,548 --> 01:17:11,513
which, quite frankly,
apart from two studies in grey

1274
01:17:11,550 --> 01:17:13,646
by Whistler,
was exceedingly forgettable.

1275
01:17:13,683 --> 01:17:16,352
And that's exactly what
lord goring then proceeded to do.

1276
01:17:16,389 --> 01:17:19,389
Namely forget it...
before he even saw it.

1277
01:17:19,425 --> 01:17:22,153
For, you see, he never appeared.

1278
01:17:22,459 --> 01:17:27,297
A fact which I find most upsetting, both
on behalf of myself and Mr. Whistler.

1279
01:17:27,333 --> 01:17:29,788
And we're both deciding whether
or not to forgive him.

1280
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:35,261
In the meantime I delivered the letter
myself to your office this morning.

1281
01:17:35,541 --> 01:17:38,526
And you know
the fact of the matter is...

1282
01:17:38,563 --> 01:17:41,513
I still haven't heard
a word of apology!

1283
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:44,400
Umm. Sorry.

1284
01:17:44,436 --> 01:17:46,411
I forgive you.

1285
01:17:46,448 --> 01:17:48,385
Thank you.

1286
01:17:49,221 --> 01:17:50,518
Is this true?

1287
01:18:05,972 --> 01:18:08,675
"When you left...

1288
01:18:08,711 --> 01:18:10,906
my life...

1289
01:18:11,778 --> 01:18:15,237
my life fell apart."

1290
01:18:16,483 --> 01:18:18,816
"I need you after all."

1291
01:18:20,855 --> 01:18:23,882
Your life fell apart, Gertrude?

1292
01:18:28,331 --> 01:18:29,661
Yes.

1293
01:18:33,569 --> 01:18:36,333
You, you need me, Gertrude?

1294
01:18:37,940 --> 01:18:39,572
Yes.

1295
01:18:39,609 --> 01:18:42,611
Why did you not say
that you loved me?

1296
01:18:42,648 --> 01:18:44,671
Oh, because I love you!

1297
01:18:46,515 --> 01:18:48,715
I, I do not care what...

1298
01:18:48,752 --> 01:18:51,854
what punishment or disgrace
is in store for me.

1299
01:18:51,891 --> 01:18:53,854
This letter of yours, Gertrude...

1300
01:18:53,891 --> 01:18:58,595
makes me feel that nothing that the
world can do can harm me now.

1301
01:18:58,632 --> 01:19:02,929
There's no disgrace in store for you,
nor any public shame.

1302
01:19:07,639 --> 01:19:10,672
I...

1303
01:19:10,709 --> 01:19:11,874
I, I don't understand.

1304
01:19:11,910 --> 01:19:15,403
We have much to thank him for,
Robert.

1305
01:19:15,915 --> 01:19:19,068
When I finished
my speech last night, I...

1306
01:19:19,105 --> 01:19:22,185
felt sure that
my future was in ruins.

1307
01:19:22,222 --> 01:19:24,348
And when you began it
I wasn't so sure about my own.

1308
01:19:24,824 --> 01:19:26,883
I don't know how to thank you.

1309
01:19:29,162 --> 01:19:30,858
I'm sure I'll think of something.

1310
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:36,293
Er, in the meantime I'd be
grateful for the return of my hand.

1311
01:19:40,941 --> 01:19:42,533
Miss Mabel.

1312
01:19:47,181 --> 01:19:48,580
Miss Mabel.

1313
01:19:49,450 --> 01:19:50,712
Miss Mabel, wait.

1314
01:19:55,189 --> 01:19:57,420
I, er...

1315
01:19:57,659 --> 01:20:01,196
I have something
very particular to say to you.

1316
01:20:01,233 --> 01:20:02,788
Is it a proposal?

1317
01:20:04,733 --> 01:20:07,760
Well. Yes, it is.

1318
01:20:08,838 --> 01:20:10,430
It is?

1319
01:20:12,542 --> 01:20:14,477
I, I think it is.

1320
01:20:14,745 --> 01:20:16,372
Well yes or no?

1321
01:20:16,647 --> 01:20:17,748
Well, actually, yes.

1322
01:20:17,785 --> 01:20:19,483
I'm afraid it is.

1323
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:20,515
I'm so glad.

1324
01:20:20,551 --> 01:20:22,720
That makes the second one
today.

1325
01:20:22,757 --> 01:20:23,918
What?

1326
01:20:23,954 --> 01:20:24,786
Oh dear, not...?

1327
01:20:24,823 --> 01:20:26,454
Yes... Tommy Trafford.

1328
01:20:26,490 --> 01:20:28,424
It is one of Tommy's days
for proposing.

1329
01:20:28,460 --> 01:20:31,863
He always proposes on Thursdays
during the season.

1330
01:20:31,900 --> 01:20:34,365
Ah... but today is Friday.

1331
01:20:34,401 --> 01:20:35,329
I know.

1332
01:20:35,366 --> 01:20:36,958
Today is special.

1333
01:20:39,204 --> 01:20:41,695
Well, you didn't accept him,
did you?

1334
01:20:42,207 --> 01:20:45,938
I shall be in the conservatory under
the second palm tree on the right.

1335
01:20:48,481 --> 01:20:50,216
The second palm tree
on the right?

1336
01:20:50,253 --> 01:20:53,674
The usual palm tree.

1337
01:20:53,919 --> 01:20:55,648
And then we'll see how you do.

1338
01:20:56,823 --> 01:20:57,847
The usual?

1339
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:01,987
Well, sir,
what are you doing here?

1340
01:21:02,696 --> 01:21:05,324
Wasting your time as usual.

1341
01:21:06,233 --> 01:21:08,566
My dear father...
when one pays a visit...

1342
01:21:08,603 --> 01:21:11,439
it is for the purpose of wasting
other people's time and not one's own.

1343
01:21:11,476 --> 01:21:12,504
What are you doing here?

1344
01:21:12,540 --> 01:21:14,633
I've important news for Chiltern.

1345
01:21:17,912 --> 01:21:19,344
A seat in the Cabinet.

1346
01:21:19,380 --> 01:21:21,413
Certainly,
and you well deserve it too.

1347
01:21:21,449 --> 01:21:23,987
You have got what we want
so much in policical life nowadays...

1348
01:21:24,023 --> 01:21:27,420
high character high moral tone

1349
01:21:27,456 --> 01:21:30,948
Everything that you have not got, sir,
and never will have.

1350
01:21:42,572 --> 01:21:47,202
I... cannot accept this offer,
Lord Caversham.

1351
01:21:48,012 --> 01:21:50,281
I have decided to decline it.

1352
01:21:50,317 --> 01:21:52,179
Decline it, sir?

1353
01:21:52,215 --> 01:21:55,402
It is my intention to retire
at once from public life.

1354
01:21:55,439 --> 01:21:58,553
Decline a seat in the Cabinet
and retire from public life?

1355
01:21:58,589 --> 01:22:02,494
I never heard such damned nonsense
in the whole course of my existence!

1356
01:22:02,530 --> 01:22:04,860
Oh, I beg your pardon,
lady Chiltern.

1357
01:22:04,896 --> 01:22:08,195
Will you kindly prevent
your husband from making such a...

1358
01:22:08,231 --> 01:22:11,495
I think my husband is right,
Lord Caversham. I agree with him.

1359
01:22:12,038 --> 01:22:14,154
You agree? Good heavens.

1360
01:22:14,190 --> 01:22:16,271
I admire him for it.

1361
01:22:16,510 --> 01:22:19,308
I admire him immensely for it.

1362
01:22:21,949 --> 01:22:24,940
I shall write at once to
the Prime Minister.

1363
01:22:26,619 --> 01:22:28,588
If you'll excuse me for a moment,
Lord Caversham.

1364
01:22:28,624 --> 01:22:30,249
Lord Caversham.

1365
01:22:32,926 --> 01:22:35,690
What is the matter
with this family?

1366
01:22:36,564 --> 01:22:38,396
There's something wrong here... eh?

1367
01:22:38,432 --> 01:22:42,927
Idiocy. Hereditary perhaps...
Both of them too.

1368
01:22:43,438 --> 01:22:45,906
Very sad. Very sad indeed.

1369
01:22:46,508 --> 01:22:49,273
They're not an old family.

1370
01:22:49,544 --> 01:22:50,909
I can't understand it.

1371
01:22:52,013 --> 01:22:55,384
Oh well, suppose I'd better go back
to the Prime Minister and tell him

1372
01:22:55,420 --> 01:22:56,882
Chiltern's the damnedest fool I ever
met and won't take the seat.

1373
01:22:56,919 --> 01:23:00,323
Oh no, father, I would rather you did not
quite. I'd rather you,took a seat yourself?

1374
01:23:00,359 --> 01:23:02,222
Why are you prating about?

1375
01:23:02,258 --> 01:23:04,911
Why don't you go in there
for a while, father, hmm?

1376
01:23:04,948 --> 01:23:07,564
The second palm tree to the right,
The usual palm.

1377
01:23:07,601 --> 01:23:08,429
What?

1378
01:23:08,465 --> 01:23:10,301
There's somebody
I want you to talk to.

1379
01:23:10,337 --> 01:23:11,370
What about?

1380
01:23:11,406 --> 01:23:12,402
About me, sir.

1381
01:23:12,438 --> 01:23:13,630
Hmmm?

1382
01:23:14,739 --> 01:23:17,901
Not a subject on which
much eloquence is possible.

1383
01:23:25,349 --> 01:23:26,373
Gertrude.

1384
01:23:32,724 --> 01:23:37,895
Yes, Arthur, it is Robert himself
who wishes to retire from public life.

1385
01:23:37,932 --> 01:23:38,461
Really.

1386
01:23:38,497 --> 01:23:39,494
It was he who first said so.

1387
01:23:39,531 --> 01:23:41,501
Rather than lose your love
he would do anything

1388
01:23:41,537 --> 01:23:43,268
Has he not been punished enough?

1389
01:23:43,305 --> 01:23:45,639
We've both been punished.

1390
01:23:45,675 --> 01:23:47,937
I set him up too high.

1391
01:23:47,973 --> 01:23:50,240
Do not then set him down
now too low.

1392
01:23:50,276 --> 01:23:54,213
Dear Gertrude, it is not the perfect
but the imperfect who have need of love.

1393
01:23:55,015 --> 01:23:57,751
You seem to know a great deal
about everything all of a sudden.

1394
01:23:57,788 --> 01:24:00,985
I hope not.

1395
01:24:01,022 --> 01:24:02,954
All I do know...

1396
01:24:02,990 --> 01:24:05,910
is that is takes great
courage to see the world

1397
01:24:05,947 --> 01:24:08,794
in all its tainted glory
and still to love it.

1398
01:24:08,830 --> 01:24:11,996
And even more courage to
see it in the one you love.

1399
01:24:12,033 --> 01:24:15,669
Dear Gertrude you have more courage
than any woman I know.

1400
01:24:15,706 --> 01:24:18,764
Do not be afraid to use it.

1401
01:24:40,330 --> 01:24:42,195
Well Lady Caversham
need never know.

1402
01:24:44,234 --> 01:24:45,293
Thank you, father.

1403
01:24:45,702 --> 01:24:47,304
Can't say I hold up
much hope, old man.

1404
01:24:47,341 --> 01:24:48,272
What?

1405
01:25:17,903 --> 01:25:18,927
Lord Goring?

1406
01:25:20,940 --> 01:25:23,374
You have something
you wish to say to me?

1407
01:25:27,247 --> 01:25:28,772
Marry me, M...

1408
01:25:33,888 --> 01:25:35,823
Marry me, Miss Mabel.

1409
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:40,593
Well... Lord Goring...

1410
01:25:40,629 --> 01:25:43,359
I must say this comes
as quite a surprise.

1411
01:25:44,901 --> 01:25:46,803
Well, if you need time
to consider, I'll just...

1412
01:25:46,839 --> 01:25:47,499
No.

1413
01:25:47,536 --> 01:25:50,406
No, I don't need time,
I need a reason.

1414
01:25:50,442 --> 01:25:51,532
What?

1415
01:25:52,342 --> 01:25:56,278
A reason why you think
I should marry you.

1416
01:25:57,647 --> 01:25:59,946
Oh, umm...

1417
01:26:05,555 --> 01:26:07,002
A reason you say?

1418
01:26:07,038 --> 01:26:08,448
A good one... yes.

1419
01:26:09,660 --> 01:26:10,456
Robert.

1420
01:26:13,997 --> 01:26:15,521
May I?

1421
01:26:16,266 --> 01:26:17,597
Of course.

1422
01:26:25,744 --> 01:26:26,541
Gertrude.

1423
01:26:26,578 --> 01:26:29,810
It is more than enough to know that
you would sacrifice it when I asked.

1424
01:26:30,915 --> 01:26:34,986
We have, all of us,
feet of clay, Robert.

1425
01:26:35,023 --> 01:26:37,548
Women as well as men.

1426
01:26:40,694 --> 01:26:42,594
Can it be that...

1427
01:26:43,397 --> 01:26:45,797
That you've forgiven me?

1428
01:26:47,968 --> 01:26:50,869
I sup...
I suppose it must be that.

1429
01:26:52,373 --> 01:26:54,602
Oh goodness.

1430
01:26:55,743 --> 01:26:57,574
Hold me, Robert.

1431
01:27:01,983 --> 01:27:03,879
Forgive me.

1432
01:27:03,915 --> 01:27:05,775
Gertrude.

1433
01:27:07,288 --> 01:27:12,989
Gertrude, my wife.

1434
01:27:20,970 --> 01:27:23,733
I love you.

1435
01:27:24,841 --> 01:27:26,638
I love you.

1436
01:27:28,578 --> 01:27:30,314
Is that your reason?

1437
01:27:30,350 --> 01:27:32,440
Hmm.

1438
01:27:32,850 --> 01:27:35,546
I love you.

1439
01:27:36,586 --> 01:27:37,719
I said

1440
01:27:37,755 --> 01:27:38,689
Mabel I said...

1441
01:27:38,725 --> 01:27:40,623
I, I know.

1442
01:27:40,991 --> 01:27:42,755
Well...

1443
01:27:43,261 --> 01:27:44,819
Couldn't you...

1444
01:27:46,297 --> 01:27:48,357
Love me just
a little bit in return?

1445
01:27:50,335 --> 01:27:53,361
Arthur... you silly...

1446
01:27:54,472 --> 01:27:56,775
If you knew anything about
anything... which you don't...

1447
01:27:56,811 --> 01:28:01,746
You'd know that
I absolutely adore you.

1448
01:28:01,783 --> 01:28:03,304
Really?

1449
01:28:05,617 --> 01:28:07,983
Well... why didn't you
mention it before?

1450
01:28:08,855 --> 01:28:11,824
Because... dear boy...

1451
01:28:12,291 --> 01:28:14,487
You never would
have believed me.

1452
01:28:41,924 --> 01:28:43,858
What the devil's going on
in this house?

1453
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:52,832
Congratulations!

1454
01:28:52,869 --> 01:28:56,840
If the country doesn't go to the dogs or
the radicals we'll have you prime Minister!

1455
01:28:56,876 --> 01:28:57,871
Thank you, Lord Caversham.

1456
01:28:57,908 --> 01:29:01,578
And Arthur... I only wish there was
something I could do to repay you.

1457
01:29:01,615 --> 01:29:04,638
Well, Robert...
as a matter of fact there is.

1458
01:29:05,315 --> 01:29:07,781
You are your sister's guardian.

1459
01:29:07,818 --> 01:29:09,921
I should like your consent
to our marriage, that is all.

1460
01:29:09,958 --> 01:29:11,887
Oh, I'm so glad.

1461
01:29:11,923 --> 01:29:13,391
You wish to marry Mabel?

1462
01:29:13,427 --> 01:29:14,455
Yes.

1463
01:29:14,492 --> 01:29:17,620
I'm sorry, Arthur, but the thing
is quite out of the question.

1464
01:29:18,163 --> 01:29:19,220
Oh, Robert.

1465
01:29:19,598 --> 01:29:23,936
No, I have to consider
Mabel's future happiness and as...

1466
01:29:23,972 --> 01:29:26,402
Much as I care for you, Arthur...

1467
01:29:26,439 --> 01:29:29,641
I don't think her happiness
would be safe in your hands.

1468
01:29:29,678 --> 01:29:31,173
But I love Mabel.

1469
01:29:31,210 --> 01:29:32,905
No other woman has a place
in heart.

1470
01:29:33,546 --> 01:29:36,743
Darling, if they truly love each
other, why should they not be married?

1471
01:29:39,219 --> 01:29:40,550
I shall tell you.

1472
01:29:41,655 --> 01:29:43,753
When I called on Lord Goring.

1473
01:29:43,790 --> 01:29:46,523
Yesterday evening I found Mrs.
Cheverley concealed in his rooms.

1474
01:29:46,559 --> 01:29:50,620
I then discovered... that they were
at one time engaged to be married.

1475
01:29:51,365 --> 01:29:52,923
I'm very sorry, Mabel...

1476
01:29:53,666 --> 01:29:56,838
but how can I possibly
allow you to marry him when...

1477
01:29:56,874 --> 01:29:59,374
when he's involved
with another woman?

1478
01:29:59,410 --> 01:30:00,670
I'm sorry, Arthur.

1479
01:30:01,475 --> 01:30:02,966
It would be wrong of me.

1480
01:30:04,946 --> 01:30:08,348
It would be unjust to her.

1481
01:30:16,926 --> 01:30:18,324
Very well.

1482
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:19,721
But, Arthur...

1483
01:30:20,931 --> 01:30:22,023
Mabel...

1484
01:30:24,768 --> 01:30:26,759
there is nothing I can say.

1485
01:30:34,579 --> 01:30:35,511
Robert.

1486
01:30:40,584 --> 01:30:43,618
Arthur was as surprised as you...

1487
01:30:43,654 --> 01:30:46,924
to find Mrs. Cheveley
in his rooms last night.

1488
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:49,553
He was expecting...

1489
01:30:50,928 --> 01:30:52,828
quite another woman.

1490
01:30:53,364 --> 01:30:57,369
Another woman?
What d'you mean?

1491
01:30:57,405 --> 01:30:59,302
Well, the truth is...

1492
01:30:59,339 --> 01:31:02,374
The business about Mabel and,
Er, Mr. Whistler, well...

1493
01:31:02,411 --> 01:31:05,041
you see that was just...

1494
01:31:05,077 --> 01:31:10,685
my friends being kind,
and, umm... protecting me.

1495
01:31:10,721 --> 01:31:13,517
Er well, the truth is...

1496
01:31:13,554 --> 01:31:18,359
when I agreed to the story about the
letter being intended for you and...

1497
01:31:18,396 --> 01:31:22,430
not for Arthur well y...

1498
01:31:22,467 --> 01:31:23,728
you see...

1499
01:31:23,764 --> 01:31:26,290
the truth is...

1500
01:31:29,805 --> 01:31:34,469
the truth is...

1501
01:31:36,010 --> 01:31:37,638
I lied!

1502
01:31:42,418 --> 01:31:43,645
Bravo.

1503
01:31:49,759 --> 01:31:51,317
Father!

1504
01:32:05,543 --> 01:32:06,544
I need a drink.

1505
01:32:06,580 --> 01:32:07,533
Me too.

1506
01:32:29,001 --> 01:32:32,506
And if you don't make her an ideal
husband, I'll cut you off with a shilling.

1507
01:32:32,542 --> 01:32:36,271
An ideal husband. I don't think
I should like that.

1508
01:32:36,542 --> 01:32:39,212
What do you want him
to be then, my dear?

1509
01:32:39,249 --> 01:32:41,882
I think he can be whatever he chooses.

1510
01:32:41,918 --> 01:32:43,581
You don't deserve her, sir.

1511
01:32:43,617 --> 01:32:47,587
My dear father, if we men
married the women we deserved...

1512
01:32:47,624 --> 01:32:50,608
we should have a very bad time of it.

1513
01:32:50,645 --> 01:32:53,594
You're heartless, sir, quite heartless.

1514
01:32:53,631 --> 01:32:56,064
Oh, I hope not, sir.

1515
01:32:56,100 --> 01:32:58,054
I hope not.

1516
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:02,059
