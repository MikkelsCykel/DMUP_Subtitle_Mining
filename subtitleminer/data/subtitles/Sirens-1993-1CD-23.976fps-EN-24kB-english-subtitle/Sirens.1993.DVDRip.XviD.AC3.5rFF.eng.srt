1
00:02:13,978 --> 00:02:17,377
The curator agreed to remove
the paintings from the exhibition

2
00:02:17,457 --> 00:02:21,176
and sent a letter to the artist
inviting him to submit alternatives.

3
00:02:21,256 --> 00:02:23,975
Unfortunately,
the offer was refused point-blank.

4
00:02:24,055 --> 00:02:28,574
- He's threatened to go to the press.
- Mr Norman Lindsay, I take it?

5
00:02:28,654 --> 00:02:31,773
- You've heard of him.
- Well, I like to keep abreast.

6
00:02:31,853 --> 00:02:37,651
The last thing we want is a scandal.
Anyway, here they are.

7
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:40,810
Yes.

8
00:02:45,048 --> 00:02:49,407
A case could be made for the
first three. They're merely vulgar.

9
00:02:49,487 --> 00:02:52,766
But this one
is certainly blasphemous.

10
00:02:52,846 --> 00:02:57,524
- And you want me to talk him round?
- It's on the way to your new parish.

11
00:02:57,604 --> 00:03:01,363
I think an outsider has more of
a chance of getting through to him

12
00:03:01,443 --> 00:03:02,842
than any of us locals.

13
00:03:02,922 --> 00:03:05,801
I gather you were something
of a progressive at Oxford.

14
00:03:05,881 --> 00:03:09,640
Don't believe everything you hear
but yes, element of truth in that.

15
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,679
He's happy to put you
and your wife up for the night.

16
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:16,998
I think he rather relishes
the idea of a good argument.

17
00:03:17,078 --> 00:03:19,917
Well, if his reputation
is anything to go by,

18
00:03:19,997 --> 00:03:24,475
he'd love to shock the socks off
any churchman that goes near him.

19
00:03:24,555 --> 00:03:28,034
May I introduce you to my wife?
I don't think you've met.

20
00:03:30,993 --> 00:03:34,032
Estella, the Bishop of Sydney.
My wife, Estella.

21
00:03:34,112 --> 00:03:36,112
- Welcome to Australia.
- Thank you.

22
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:27,495
- Morning.
- Tickets, please.

23
00:04:30,414 --> 00:04:33,973
- Do you know if a taxi's waiting?
- Yeah. There's not.

24
00:04:35,812 --> 00:04:39,491
I, um, understand one was booked
to go to Mr Lindsay's place.

25
00:04:40,251 --> 00:04:42,330
Doing a bit of modelling, are yous?

26
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:44,249
No, I certainly am not.

27
00:04:45,569 --> 00:04:50,367
Taxi's been a bit late lately.
You'd be better off down at the pub.

28
00:04:50,687 --> 00:04:53,486
May we leave our baggage here?

29
00:04:53,566 --> 00:04:56,285
I'm about to knock off.
It'll be pilfered.

30
00:04:56,365 --> 00:05:00,484
Would you mind giving us
a hand with it, then?

31
00:05:00,564 --> 00:05:03,803
- Oh, I'm awfully sorry.
- I'll forgive you.

32
00:05:03,883 --> 00:05:06,322
- Millions wouldn't.
- Oh, dear.

33
00:05:07,202 --> 00:05:09,361
Try the pub.
It's just down the hill.

34
00:05:38,232 --> 00:05:42,110
- Morning.
- Get fucked. Get fucked.

35
00:05:46,069 --> 00:05:47,748
Ah, fuck.

36
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:52,227
Aw, fuck.

37
00:05:57,345 --> 00:05:58,905
Watch the language, everyone.

38
00:05:58,985 --> 00:06:03,143
Gents only in the bar.
Ladies' lounge is through the door.

39
00:06:03,223 --> 00:06:07,382
Yes, we don't want a drink.
We just want a taxi, if there is one.

40
00:06:07,462 --> 00:06:10,341
- Reg is at a funeral.
- I see.

41
00:06:10,421 --> 00:06:13,540
- You could be in for a long wait.
- Oh, yes?

42
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,579
It's his funeral.

43
00:06:18,258 --> 00:06:20,978
Well... Thanks.

44
00:06:21,058 --> 00:06:23,177
Hey! I got my eye on you!

45
00:06:24,216 --> 00:06:27,375
- Where yous goin'?
- Out to Mr Lindsay's place.

46
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:35,413
We're goin' out that way.
We can give you a lift.

47
00:06:35,493 --> 00:06:39,412
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- After we finish our beers.

48
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:11,601
Anthony?

49
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,878
They can't wait forever.

50
00:07:36,113 --> 00:07:38,072
Fine. Come on, then.

51
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:21,338
Thank you.

52
00:08:27,576 --> 00:08:29,935
Thanks for the lift.

53
00:08:30,015 --> 00:08:31,855
I don't mean to be rude but...

54
00:08:31,935 --> 00:08:34,494
you got a bit of food
on the side of your mouth.

55
00:08:35,573 --> 00:08:37,773
Thanks.

56
00:08:40,572 --> 00:08:41,851
See ya later.

57
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:50,249
Sorry about that, Piglet.
You all right?

58
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:54,847
They swear an awful lot.
They tend to, types like that.

59
00:08:54,927 --> 00:08:57,646
- They didn't really say anything.
- Good.

60
00:08:57,726 --> 00:09:01,845
- Now, where is everyone?
- Maybe Mr Lindsay changed his mind.

61
00:09:12,561 --> 00:09:15,201
Pooh, look, there's something here.

62
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,919
Dear visitors, sorry we missed you.
Gone out for a picnic.

63
00:09:19,999 --> 00:09:21,958
Make yourselves at home.

64
00:09:24,477 --> 00:09:26,837
Well, I suppose
we'd better not go in.

65
00:09:28,716 --> 00:09:30,635
Let's sit over by the pond.

66
00:10:01,665 --> 00:10:03,665
- Mrs Campion?
- Hello.

67
00:10:09,423 --> 00:10:11,742
What? Ah! Sorry.

68
00:10:13,142 --> 00:10:14,621
I was fast asleep there.

69
00:10:14,701 --> 00:10:19,699
You must be Mr Lindsay.
Lindsay Campion, my wife Norman.

70
00:10:19,779 --> 00:10:22,978
- Estella.
- Just out from England?

71
00:10:23,058 --> 00:10:25,737
That's it. We arrived
just a couple of weeks ago.

72
00:10:25,817 --> 00:10:28,057
So they weren't game to send a local?

73
00:10:28,137 --> 00:10:30,456
Well, you...
you're exactly on our way.

74
00:10:31,536 --> 00:10:35,014
Oh, well. I'm glad
you got here in one piece.

75
00:10:35,094 --> 00:10:37,614
Excuse me, I gotta get back to work.

76
00:10:37,694 --> 00:10:41,652
Giddy and Sheela'll show you a room.
You'd probably like to freshen up.

77
00:10:41,732 --> 00:10:44,571
- We'd love to, thank you.
- Thank you very much.

78
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:49,490
- You take that for me...
- This way, ladies and gents.

79
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:50,969
Maggie!

80
00:11:01,686 --> 00:11:04,325
Thank you. Lovely.

81
00:11:05,604 --> 00:11:07,484
You'll have trouble sleeping.

82
00:11:07,564 --> 00:11:10,523
She sleeps next door
and she snores terribly.

83
00:11:11,562 --> 00:11:15,481
- I do not.
- She sounds like two possums mating.

84
00:11:15,561 --> 00:11:18,520
That's so horrible and it's not true.

85
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,999
Whereabouts is the, uh...

86
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:24,478
Take him out to the thunder box.

87
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:27,397
Just a tick.

88
00:11:30,396 --> 00:11:32,995
I've never snored in my life.

89
00:11:33,075 --> 00:11:37,074
I think snoring
can be quite charming, actually.

90
00:11:37,474 --> 00:11:39,553
This way.

91
00:11:39,633 --> 00:11:43,712
Why do they call it a thunder box?
Cos it's out in the wind and rain?

92
00:11:43,792 --> 00:11:47,391
I suppose. But you always need
to keep your shoes on.

93
00:11:47,471 --> 00:11:52,509
- Are there stinging nettles?
- Yes, and scorpions and centipedes.

94
00:11:52,589 --> 00:11:53,869
Hell.

95
00:11:53,949 --> 00:11:56,708
- Can you swim?
- Not very well.

96
00:11:58,187 --> 00:12:02,146
I'll wake you up. There's
a swimming hole we go to every day.

97
00:12:02,226 --> 00:12:05,545
- I'm Sheela.
- Estella.

98
00:12:08,344 --> 00:12:11,623
Does he always take the Bible
with him to the dunny?

99
00:12:11,703 --> 00:12:15,542
It wasn't the Bible. He just doesn't
like wasting time, that's all.

100
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:22,619
Well, from the size of it,
he could be there all night.

101
00:12:24,818 --> 00:12:27,937
I should've warned him
about the redbacks.

102
00:12:28,017 --> 00:12:31,096
- What are they?
- Small spiders with big teeth.

103
00:12:31,176 --> 00:12:35,055
- They live under toilet seats.
- How do you know if they're there?

104
00:12:35,135 --> 00:12:37,094
By the screams.

105
00:13:08,004 --> 00:13:10,324
Ah, there you are.

106
00:13:11,163 --> 00:13:13,243
Mr Lindsay's wonderful, isn't he?

107
00:13:13,323 --> 00:13:15,642
He said we're gonna do
The Sirens next.

108
00:13:15,722 --> 00:13:17,721
- Do you know about them?
- Certainly.

109
00:13:17,801 --> 00:13:21,320
They lived on the island of Atlantis
and sang songs from the cliffs

110
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:25,279
and sailors from passing ships were
driven mad by these gorgeous voices.

111
00:13:25,359 --> 00:13:28,238
And the ships would be dashed
against the rocks

112
00:13:28,318 --> 00:13:31,157
and the sailors dragged down
to a blissful death

113
00:13:31,237 --> 00:13:35,315
with the voices of the sirens
ringing in their ears.

114
00:13:35,395 --> 00:13:38,474
I think myths
are a bit stupid, really.

115
00:13:39,394 --> 00:13:41,353
I'll be wearing this.

116
00:13:42,673 --> 00:13:44,992
You know, you could pose, too,
if you like.

117
00:13:45,072 --> 00:13:48,511
He always needs more models.
Go on, try it. Please.

118
00:13:48,591 --> 00:13:50,870
There's some male ones too.

119
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:52,830
I don't think that's quite for us.

120
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:56,508
Well, you could always wear a dagger,
strategically placed.

121
00:13:59,348 --> 00:14:04,906
Or a sword. Whichever you need.
And dinner's ready.

122
00:14:04,986 --> 00:14:07,105
Oh, that's right.

123
00:14:07,185 --> 00:14:09,184
I was sent to fetch you.

124
00:14:10,904 --> 00:14:15,262
I don't... like people thinking
I'm like the other models.

125
00:14:15,342 --> 00:14:18,901
I'm working here as a maid.
Mr Lindsay asked me to pose

126
00:14:18,981 --> 00:14:22,420
and I said I would
if I could keep my clothes on.

127
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:26,499
Because I really think it's important
to keep one's mystique,

128
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:28,898
don't you, Mr Campion?

129
00:14:28,978 --> 00:14:32,017
Is it Mr Campion
or Father Anthony?

130
00:14:32,097 --> 00:14:33,696
It's, uh, it's Tony.

131
00:14:35,536 --> 00:14:39,334
Do you think it's a sin... Tony?

132
00:14:39,414 --> 00:14:42,453
I don't think there's anything sinful
about the body.

133
00:14:42,533 --> 00:14:46,012
There's a tradition of religious
painting featuring the nude.

134
00:14:46,092 --> 00:14:50,851
It's a question of... how the artist
uses the body that's important.

135
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:55,009
So, do you think
Mr Lindsay's paintings are rude?

136
00:14:59,288 --> 00:15:01,247
Some I think are profane.

137
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:05,726
Oh, that's good. I'm starving.

138
00:15:05,806 --> 00:15:08,365
I only eat once a day
cos my mother's very fat

139
00:15:08,445 --> 00:15:10,004
and it runs in my family.

140
00:15:10,084 --> 00:15:13,283
You should see my grandpa.
He looks like the Michelin Man.

141
00:15:13,363 --> 00:15:16,602
You know, the one
with all those tyres around him?

142
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:19,801
He eats like a horse!
He puts tomato sauce on everything.

143
00:15:21,081 --> 00:15:25,439
It was a very enlightened society.
The artists made all the decisions.

144
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,879
That's why there's no record
of warfare

145
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,318
between the Atlanteans
and anyone else.

146
00:15:30,398 --> 00:15:33,037
The main question is, where was it?

147
00:15:33,117 --> 00:15:35,796
The Mediterranean
is the most likely spot.

148
00:15:35,876 --> 00:15:38,275
They're always digging up pottery

149
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:41,074
that doesn't belong to
any known civilization.

150
00:15:41,154 --> 00:15:43,913
How could a complete people
just disappear?

151
00:15:43,993 --> 00:15:47,872
Well, a cataclysm. They were all
wiped out in a cataclysm.

152
00:15:47,952 --> 00:15:50,031
Whole island sank in an earthquake.

153
00:15:50,111 --> 00:15:52,870
So you're a genuine believer
in Atlantis?

154
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:56,349
Well, I lived there
in a former incarnation.

155
00:15:58,269 --> 00:16:01,907
I ask because the cataclysm can be
seen as an image of moral collapse

156
00:16:01,987 --> 00:16:05,746
and some think we're going through
a similar period of decay.

157
00:16:05,826 --> 00:16:08,025
Do you explore that in your painting?

158
00:16:08,105 --> 00:16:13,024
I think people have always
been decaying, whenever they can.

159
00:16:13,104 --> 00:16:16,703
He's just a very depraved man,
I'm afraid, Mr Campion.

160
00:16:16,783 --> 00:16:18,382
No one's safe.

161
00:16:22,141 --> 00:16:24,020
I'm bloody bored!

162
00:16:26,739 --> 00:16:28,659
Have you seen those fairies lately?

163
00:16:28,739 --> 00:16:31,818
A couple of them were out
last Friday.

164
00:16:31,898 --> 00:16:33,977
- They were not!
- They were too.

165
00:16:34,057 --> 00:16:36,656
They always come out
on Fridays round midnight.

166
00:16:36,736 --> 00:16:38,455
They do not. Do they, Mummy?

167
00:16:38,535 --> 00:16:40,975
Yes, you don't see them
cos you're asleep.

168
00:16:41,055 --> 00:16:43,734
Tonight's Friday,
as a matter of fact.

169
00:16:43,814 --> 00:16:47,013
But then you'd be
too bloody bored to see them.

170
00:16:47,093 --> 00:16:50,691
No, I'm not, Mummy.
I promise I won't be bored.

171
00:16:50,771 --> 00:16:54,210
- Even bloody bored?
- Promise!

172
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:57,729
Well, if you're gonna be up
at midnight, get to bed now.

173
00:17:01,408 --> 00:17:04,687
- Say good night to everybody.
- Good night, everybody.

174
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:09,965
- Do they really come, Mummy?
- Fairies only live in books.

175
00:17:10,045 --> 00:17:12,884
The Industrial Revolution
killed the fairies.

176
00:17:12,964 --> 00:17:15,363
They were left with nowhere to live.

177
00:17:15,443 --> 00:17:19,642
- Except our imaginations.
- Imaginations are a luxury.

178
00:17:20,602 --> 00:17:23,961
- Beg your pardon?
- Most people can't afford them.

179
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:27,279
I don't think imagination
is dependent on economics, is it?

180
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:31,278
In a factory you're doing exactly
the same thing day after day.

181
00:17:31,358 --> 00:17:35,517
An active imagination is what allows
people to do that kind of work.

182
00:17:35,597 --> 00:17:38,236
Oh, well, you'd know, of course!

183
00:17:39,316 --> 00:17:42,914
I just think
that's what you'd have to do.

184
00:17:42,994 --> 00:17:45,673
You'd have to be imagining
other things.

185
00:17:45,753 --> 00:17:48,752
Please don't tell us
what the working class think,

186
00:17:48,832 --> 00:17:50,912
thanks very much.

187
00:18:05,947 --> 00:18:08,266
I think what the Bishop's
really hoping for

188
00:18:08,346 --> 00:18:11,065
is that we can come to a compromise,

189
00:18:11,145 --> 00:18:13,744
find some other examples
of your work.

190
00:18:13,824 --> 00:18:16,143
The great thing is no... Your chair.

191
00:18:16,223 --> 00:18:20,742
- No one wants to see you excluded.
- Now, that is a comfort.

192
00:18:20,822 --> 00:18:24,501
I hadn't realised the Church's
interest in contemporary painting.

193
00:18:24,581 --> 00:18:27,820
It's just The Crucified Venus
we're uncomfortable with.

194
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:32,698
- Pooh?
- It's me.

195
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,018
Come in.

196
00:18:36,977 --> 00:18:40,695
Poor old Piglet.
Pru gave you a bit of a working over.

197
00:18:40,775 --> 00:18:45,294
I'll survive.
Did you get anywhere with Mr Lindsay?

198
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:48,613
He insists it's up to the public
to decide for themselves

199
00:18:48,693 --> 00:18:50,252
if they want to see his pictures.

200
00:18:50,332 --> 00:18:53,091
Of course, they have to see them
first to decide,

201
00:18:53,171 --> 00:18:55,651
by which time
the damage has been done,

202
00:18:55,731 --> 00:18:59,329
but that is a bit of logic
which is lost upon him. Never mind.

203
00:19:00,129 --> 00:19:03,248
I'll have another shot
in the morning before we go.

204
00:19:03,328 --> 00:19:06,687
Do you think the pictures
actually damage people?

205
00:19:07,527 --> 00:19:11,006
I think that the sexual ones
are just rather childish

206
00:19:11,085 --> 00:19:13,885
but I do think
negative images build up

207
00:19:13,965 --> 00:19:15,804
and don't any good in the long run

208
00:19:15,884 --> 00:19:20,562
and I think The Crucified Venus
is offensive and downright arrogant.

209
00:19:20,642 --> 00:19:22,562
- I'm coming, I'm coming!

210
00:19:23,401 --> 00:19:26,121
- Hurry up, stupid!
- I'm running as fast as I can,

211
00:19:26,201 --> 00:19:28,360
you disgusting thing!

212
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,999
My guess is they're tooth fairies.

213
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:34,638
- Shall we?
- Come on, then.

214
00:22:17,225 --> 00:22:19,744
- Swimming?
- What's the time?

215
00:22:19,824 --> 00:22:23,103
The train doesn't leave until 12.

216
00:22:23,183 --> 00:22:24,542
All right.

217
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:33,299
Anthony.

218
00:22:33,379 --> 00:22:36,378
What'd you do to him?
He's exhausted.

219
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:39,577
- Anthony!
- Don't wake him up.

220
00:22:39,657 --> 00:22:41,936
Well, he might be dreaming.

221
00:22:42,016 --> 00:22:45,295
It's dangerous to wake somebody up
if they're dreaming

222
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:48,254
because you leave part
of your brain behind.

223
00:22:48,334 --> 00:22:50,974
If it happens a lot,
you go feeble in the head.

224
00:22:51,053 --> 00:22:54,452
Yeah. You're living proof.

225
00:22:57,291 --> 00:23:00,131
All right, I'll join you in a minute.

226
00:23:23,723 --> 00:23:26,082
- Are you rich?
- Not very.

227
00:23:27,801 --> 00:23:31,480
- What does your father do for crust?
- Why do you ask?

228
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:35,599
Well, Pru thinks you're bourgeois,
that's all.

229
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:37,798
Mine was taken by a shark.

230
00:23:37,878 --> 00:23:39,838
God, how awful!

231
00:23:41,157 --> 00:23:42,996
There wasn't much left of him.

232
00:23:43,076 --> 00:23:46,555
So I was brought up mainly by my mum.
She runs a sweet shop.

233
00:23:46,635 --> 00:23:50,794
But I'm quite ambitious all the same.
I was determined to keep my figure,

234
00:23:50,874 --> 00:23:54,673
which was hard with chocolate wombats
and toffee apples everywhere.

235
00:23:54,753 --> 00:23:58,711
- But as you can see, I succeeded.
- Because you wanted to be a model?

236
00:23:58,791 --> 00:24:01,111
Oh, no.
Modelling is just to get known.

237
00:24:01,191 --> 00:24:03,110
I'm going to be a famous actress.

238
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:06,029
People will know me through
Mr Lindsay's paintings,

239
00:24:06,109 --> 00:24:08,308
then I'll move on to
stage and screen.

240
00:24:19,465 --> 00:24:21,464
They're just doing it to show off.

241
00:24:21,544 --> 00:24:24,663
They're very common.
They can't help it.

242
00:24:24,743 --> 00:24:27,942
Sheela's got
ten brothers and sisters.

243
00:24:28,022 --> 00:24:32,380
She wants to be an artist like Norman
but poor girl, she's hopeless.

244
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:37,299
- And Pru wants to be an aviator.
- Aviatrix.

245
00:24:39,458 --> 00:24:41,537
I'm gonna splash you.

246
00:24:48,455 --> 00:24:53,174
- Be careful of the water snakes.
- There aren't any water snakes.

247
00:25:06,369 --> 00:25:08,129
Quick, someone's coming!

248
00:25:10,088 --> 00:25:14,607
- Hide!
- It's all right, he can hardly see.

249
00:25:15,686 --> 00:25:18,205
- Devlin!
- Come and have a swim.

250
00:25:18,285 --> 00:25:23,124
Don't get him to come in.
He might... brush against you.

251
00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:37,879
Come in.

252
00:25:47,676 --> 00:25:50,995
You shouldn't have anything to do
with him. He's a criminal.

253
00:25:51,075 --> 00:25:54,274
- You dream about him, don't you?
- I do not!

254
00:25:54,353 --> 00:25:57,752
You lie on the ground
while he licks your belly button.

255
00:25:57,832 --> 00:26:01,871
You're so disgusting, flaunting
yourselves. You're so cheap!

256
00:26:01,951 --> 00:26:04,790
He wouldn't know
if we were dressed or not.

257
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:07,509
Do you have to carry on
in front of Estella?

258
00:26:07,589 --> 00:26:11,548
- What's wrong with her?
- She'll think we're... barbarians.

259
00:26:11,628 --> 00:26:13,507
We are!

260
00:26:13,587 --> 00:26:16,426
Don't. Don't. Don't.

261
00:26:30,022 --> 00:26:31,741
- Morning.
- Morning.

262
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,220
The papers got hold of it.

263
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:40,778
"When the exhibition arrives in
London, the English will be convinced

264
00:26:40,858 --> 00:26:45,417
"Australia is peopled by degenerates
afflicted with sex mania. "

265
00:26:45,497 --> 00:26:47,536
Must be why they deported us.

266
00:26:47,616 --> 00:26:52,255
The other news is that it seems
we'll be here for another day or so.

267
00:26:52,335 --> 00:26:56,053
The train was derailed and a
section of track has to be repaired.

268
00:26:56,133 --> 00:26:59,652
Rose is very kindly giving us a ride
into town this afternoon

269
00:26:59,732 --> 00:27:01,931
to see how long it's going to be.

270
00:27:03,571 --> 00:27:06,690
These flies are
remarkably persistent.

271
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:09,809
I just... ate one, I think.
Came in on me honey.

272
00:27:09,889 --> 00:27:11,688
Made me feel funny...

273
00:27:11,768 --> 00:27:13,967
in me tummy.

274
00:27:24,324 --> 00:27:27,963
- May I speak?
- Briefly.

275
00:27:28,043 --> 00:27:31,762
I just wondered if you'd be
interested in today's editorial?

276
00:27:31,842 --> 00:27:34,401
I try to ignore the press
as much as I can.

277
00:27:34,481 --> 00:27:37,120
Isn't it hard
to sustain your vision

278
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,399
when it flies so completely
in the face of public opinion?

279
00:27:41,958 --> 00:27:45,117
So the arrows of your detractors
bounce off, do they?

280
00:27:45,197 --> 00:27:47,556
Vanity is a formidable armour.

281
00:27:51,515 --> 00:27:53,235
Oh, here we go.

282
00:27:53,315 --> 00:27:58,033
"The excesses of Lindsay have
long been a source of consternation

283
00:27:58,113 --> 00:28:01,112
"to clean-living citizens
of this country.

284
00:28:01,192 --> 00:28:05,031
"He paints people who seem to be
slaves of cocaine or similar,

285
00:28:05,111 --> 00:28:08,750
"which has reduced them to
frenzied and shameless morbidity.

286
00:28:09,629 --> 00:28:13,988
"Today, however, not content with
scorning standards of public decency,

287
00:28:14,068 --> 00:28:19,546
"he profanes the most sacred image
of Christianity, the Crucifixion. "

288
00:28:19,626 --> 00:28:23,105
As if I give a damn about
these Wesleyans, these wowsers.

289
00:28:23,185 --> 00:28:27,024
Well, it's quite a lot of people
who hold the Crucifixion sacred.

290
00:28:27,103 --> 00:28:30,382
- Anyway, you're busy.
- Mr Campion, I am an artist

291
00:28:30,462 --> 00:28:34,501
and I refuse to be compromised by
the scruples of the public!

292
00:28:34,581 --> 00:28:37,940
- Scruples or beliefs?
- And this Crucifixion business.

293
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,979
When I was a boy,

294
00:28:40,059 --> 00:28:43,618
my mother used to try to instruct us
on the sad story of Jesus,

295
00:28:43,698 --> 00:28:45,817
how He died on the cross for us.

296
00:28:45,897 --> 00:28:49,016
My whole being rose in revolt
against the idea!

297
00:28:49,096 --> 00:28:52,535
It's a vile notion
that a god should sacrifice himself

298
00:28:52,615 --> 00:28:55,974
for the sins of mankind,
it's a pestilent notion.

299
00:28:56,054 --> 00:28:59,093
- Well, I couldn't agree with that.
- Hang on.

300
00:28:59,173 --> 00:29:02,732
As for the suffering my poor pictures
will cause a few people,

301
00:29:02,812 --> 00:29:06,890
it's nothing compared to
the suffering the Church has caused.

302
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:10,089
The burning of witches,
the Spanish Inquisition,

303
00:29:10,169 --> 00:29:12,849
the slaughter of pagan tribes
and so on.

304
00:29:12,928 --> 00:29:14,968
Anyway, there we are.

305
00:29:15,048 --> 00:29:16,567
Must get back to work.

306
00:29:19,566 --> 00:29:21,646
I don't think the Church
can be blamed

307
00:29:21,726 --> 00:29:25,884
for everything done in-in-in-in its
name but we'll take this up later.

308
00:29:31,962 --> 00:29:33,882
Well, now, here's a thing.

309
00:29:33,962 --> 00:29:37,840
You see the article in here about
Atlantis? There's a new theory.

310
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,559
Off Norway, they reckon.

311
00:29:41,879 --> 00:29:44,358
When it sank,
it must've caused a tidal wave,

312
00:29:44,438 --> 00:29:47,117
so they're looking at
old Nordic texts

313
00:29:47,197 --> 00:29:50,116
to see if there's any evidence
of flooding.

314
00:29:51,836 --> 00:29:55,115
You're disgusting, Sheela.
You should be in a sty.

315
00:29:59,793 --> 00:30:05,991
- Watch this. Watch Giddy's skin.
- Don't you dare. Don't, Sheela.

316
00:30:06,791 --> 00:30:08,630
One day, we're gonna tickle you...

317
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:12,629
and we're gonna keep tickling you
all over.

318
00:30:12,709 --> 00:30:14,588
Stop it.

319
00:30:14,668 --> 00:30:17,507
Look at her arms and legs.
Look at the goose pimples.

320
00:30:17,587 --> 00:30:19,147
Sheela. Will you be quiet?

321
00:30:19,227 --> 00:30:22,746
- Do you know who else will do it?
- Shut up.

322
00:30:22,826 --> 00:30:26,344
- He'll be tickling you too.
- He will not.

323
00:30:26,424 --> 00:30:29,343
He'll tickle you... there.

324
00:30:31,183 --> 00:30:34,262
She'd burst.
Her insides would go everywhere.

325
00:30:34,342 --> 00:30:35,981
Sea slugs do that.

326
00:30:36,061 --> 00:30:38,940
When they get attacked,
they spit their insides out.

327
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:41,260
You can eat them and go all night.

328
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,739
There are islands
where the women gang up

329
00:30:43,819 --> 00:30:45,818
and ambush their favourite men

330
00:30:45,898 --> 00:30:48,737
and feed them
the longest sea slugs they can find.

331
00:30:48,817 --> 00:30:51,216
And the men get so incredibly hard,

332
00:30:51,296 --> 00:30:55,535
you can hang heavy clothes and jewels
from their erections.

333
00:30:55,615 --> 00:30:58,934
- But doesn't it hurt?
- Excruciatingly.

334
00:30:59,014 --> 00:31:01,133
Giddy's guts would be good for that.

335
00:31:01,213 --> 00:31:02,693
They would not!

336
00:31:02,773 --> 00:31:07,291
My giblets are pure and innocent,
like my mind.

337
00:31:21,286 --> 00:31:24,325
Let's hope it's good news and
then we can get out of your hair.

338
00:31:24,405 --> 00:31:28,444
- A couple heads more doesn't matter.
- That's very kind of you.

339
00:31:33,363 --> 00:31:36,601
I suppose there's no point
in trying to prevail on you

340
00:31:36,681 --> 00:31:40,640
to help persuade Norman just to
withdraw that particular picture?

341
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,560
- Mr Campion...
- Tony.

342
00:31:42,639 --> 00:31:44,479
Have you actually seen it?

343
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:46,678
Yes, very briefly in the gallery.

344
00:31:47,798 --> 00:31:50,917
I was the model for it, you see...

345
00:32:03,553 --> 00:32:06,232
One, two, three, charge!

346
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:13,150
Stop it.

347
00:32:14,509 --> 00:32:16,548
Stop it at once!

348
00:32:25,905 --> 00:32:29,344
What do you think you're doing?
Go on, get off! Get off.

349
00:32:31,903 --> 00:32:34,543
Go on, shoo, all of you.
All of you, go away.

350
00:32:35,502 --> 00:32:37,981
What on earth was all that about?

351
00:32:38,061 --> 00:32:40,820
They're just acting out
what their parents say -

352
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:43,939
Norman's the devil incarnate
and we're all witches.

353
00:32:45,459 --> 00:32:47,178
Go on, now, shoo.

354
00:32:47,258 --> 00:32:50,497
- You eat sheep poo!
- You disgusting things!

355
00:33:29,445 --> 00:33:31,924
- How do I look?
- Very nice.

356
00:33:32,004 --> 00:33:36,362
Can I wear it tonight? Pru and I
are going out with some blokes.

357
00:33:39,561 --> 00:33:41,481
I suppose so.

358
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:47,799
Do you often try on other people's
clothes without asking?

359
00:33:47,879 --> 00:33:51,037
All the clothes I've ever worn
are other people's.

360
00:33:54,556 --> 00:33:58,075
- Is this the ship you came out on?
- Yes.

361
00:33:59,195 --> 00:34:00,874
My dad was a sailor.

362
00:34:02,434 --> 00:34:04,393
What does he do now?

363
00:34:08,032 --> 00:34:09,511
He's dead.

364
00:34:12,271 --> 00:34:14,390
I'm sorry.

365
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:16,189
A shark took him.

366
00:34:16,269 --> 00:34:19,148
They found an arm with his watch.

367
00:34:19,228 --> 00:34:21,707
That's what they buried - the arm.

368
00:34:21,787 --> 00:34:25,226
Still used a normal-sized coffin
though, just for appearances.

369
00:34:26,226 --> 00:34:29,225
I hadn't realised sharks were so...

370
00:34:29,305 --> 00:34:31,144
Successful?

371
00:34:38,582 --> 00:34:40,541
Do you like your husband?

372
00:34:40,621 --> 00:34:44,620
Do people usually marry people
they don't like?

373
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:47,179
Quite often, I'd say.

374
00:34:47,259 --> 00:34:51,618
Now, Devlin,
I want you to pose as Ulysses.

375
00:34:51,698 --> 00:34:54,257
Is he the chap
you're going out with?

376
00:34:54,337 --> 00:34:57,536
God, no. He just does
odd jobs around the place.

377
00:34:58,975 --> 00:35:02,334
- But he can't see.
- He can't see much.

378
00:35:02,414 --> 00:35:04,214
Norman says it's all a blur.

379
00:35:04,293 --> 00:35:06,973
There was a big prizefight
out in the bush.

380
00:35:07,053 --> 00:35:10,052
It went on for hours.
Blood everywhere.

381
00:35:10,132 --> 00:35:14,050
In the end, they had to stop
cos Devlin was blind.

382
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:16,809
After a few days, he could see a bit,

383
00:35:16,889 --> 00:35:20,128
but he can't hardly recognise
anyone until they speak...

384
00:35:22,528 --> 00:35:25,726
.. but Giddy thinks
he's the best thing since Valentino.

385
00:35:26,926 --> 00:35:29,805
Merely routine for you,
old boy, I would've thought.

386
00:35:29,885 --> 00:35:32,764
See ya tomorrow night, all right?

387
00:35:38,922 --> 00:35:42,801
For too long,
you've kept sensuality in the gloom.

388
00:35:42,881 --> 00:35:45,520
You've made it furtive and guilty!

389
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:50,118
The Church has never denied that
sex has a supremely important role.

390
00:35:50,198 --> 00:35:54,677
"Vaginal pessaries require
a manipulation of her genital organs

391
00:35:54,757 --> 00:35:57,596
"which must be repugnant
to every woman. "

392
00:35:57,676 --> 00:36:00,995
See, that's the problem.
God makes us feel so guilty...

393
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:04,114
When Dolly Rogers allowed me
to play with her parts,

394
00:36:04,194 --> 00:36:06,193
I thought I'd be struck by lightning.

395
00:36:06,273 --> 00:36:08,632
- One point.
- What's your point?

396
00:36:08,712 --> 00:36:10,792
Mr Campion is trying to say

397
00:36:10,872 --> 00:36:13,751
if we give way to our whims,
we're no better than pigs.

398
00:36:13,831 --> 00:36:16,430
- Pigs?
- That's not my point!

399
00:36:18,469 --> 00:36:23,148
If God didn't want us to play with
these parts, why make them fun?

400
00:36:23,228 --> 00:36:27,346
So many people can't feed their kids
and the Church says, "Have more. "

401
00:36:27,426 --> 00:36:29,226
Here come your lovers.

402
00:36:29,306 --> 00:36:33,024
Look, Jesus never said anything
about chastity, anyway.

403
00:36:33,104 --> 00:36:35,904
That started with
some old men on an island

404
00:36:35,983 --> 00:36:38,903
that suddenly decided
the body was bad for the soul.

405
00:36:38,983 --> 00:36:42,181
- Atlantis, was it?
- It's a pity for women it wasn't.

406
00:36:42,261 --> 00:36:45,380
The fact is,
the gloomy God of the Old Testament

407
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:48,179
still has us by the scruff
of the neck today.

408
00:36:48,259 --> 00:36:51,978
When He was invented,
there were a lot of pagan religions

409
00:36:52,058 --> 00:36:55,577
that celebrated sexuality
and fertility and so on.

410
00:36:55,657 --> 00:36:59,336
So how is this new religion
to compete with something so popular?

411
00:36:59,416 --> 00:37:03,974
By saying that sex was evil and that
women, the embodiment of sexuality,

412
00:37:04,054 --> 00:37:08,133
were responsible for the downfall
of mankind in the Garden of Eden!

413
00:37:08,213 --> 00:37:13,011
- So we're second-class citizens.
- Mrs Pankhurst would be proud.

414
00:37:13,091 --> 00:37:16,490
- Why can't we be vicars or priests?
- Or popes?

415
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:20,969
Because we're too deafened by the din
of our bodies to hear God's Word.

416
00:37:21,049 --> 00:37:24,488
- Here, here.
- May I answer that question?

417
00:37:24,568 --> 00:37:26,727
- May I speak?
- Come in, boys.

418
00:37:26,807 --> 00:37:29,606
- Evenin', all. G'day.
- Evening.

419
00:37:36,884 --> 00:37:38,883
You're late.

420
00:37:39,723 --> 00:37:43,241
We had to fix up...
a couple of flyblown sheep.

421
00:37:43,321 --> 00:37:44,681
Did you wash your hands?

422
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,800
Twice.

423
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:52,838
- Eww, it's horrible.
- It's only oil, honey.

424
00:37:52,918 --> 00:37:56,277
It's sheep poo. You got sheep poo
in your fingernails.

425
00:37:58,277 --> 00:38:00,956
It's OK. We'll be wearing gloves.

426
00:38:01,675 --> 00:38:05,634
Well... better get going, I suppose.

427
00:38:05,714 --> 00:38:06,994
See yous later.

428
00:38:08,233 --> 00:38:10,872
- Good night.
- See ya.

429
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:19,510
Try one of these.

430
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:21,109
They're Turkish.

431
00:38:29,586 --> 00:38:32,265
Don't worry, Giddy.
Your time will come.

432
00:38:43,902 --> 00:38:47,580
- Any luck?
- No.

433
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:52,499
"Is there a Piglet
in the house?" said Pooh.

434
00:38:58,137 --> 00:39:00,816
They're trying to shock us,
aren't they?

435
00:39:00,896 --> 00:39:04,375
Well, church-baiting's
always been a popular pastime.

436
00:39:04,455 --> 00:39:06,734
I got an awful lot
of it at university.

437
00:39:06,814 --> 00:39:10,813
The atheists always think it's funny
to roast the dusty old Christian.

438
00:39:10,893 --> 00:39:14,132
The great thing, of course,
is not to be too dusty.

439
00:39:14,212 --> 00:39:18,610
You should have seen Lindsay's face
when I started quoting Joyce at him.

440
00:39:21,169 --> 00:39:24,168
Something wrong, Piglet?

441
00:39:24,248 --> 00:39:25,688
No.

442
00:39:25,768 --> 00:39:30,007
Those girls are perfect models
for Lindsay's orgies, aren't they?

443
00:39:31,326 --> 00:39:35,165
A shame about Giddy.
I think there's hope for her.

444
00:39:35,245 --> 00:39:39,443
She was, um... sticking up for me
at dinner. Did you notice?

445
00:39:43,842 --> 00:39:49,240
Oh, dear. I probably shouldn't have
brought you here, should I?

446
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,839
- Pooh...
- Piglet.

447
00:39:54,598 --> 00:39:57,038
I think...

448
00:39:58,117 --> 00:40:01,316
sometimes you have too high
of an opinion of me.

449
00:40:01,396 --> 00:40:03,156
What on earth makes you say that?

450
00:40:04,555 --> 00:40:07,754
- Oh, I don't know.
- You are a funny little thing.

451
00:40:13,432 --> 00:40:17,271
It's freezing. Come on, then.

452
00:40:29,347 --> 00:40:31,186
Do you want to?

453
00:40:31,266 --> 00:40:33,106
I'm not sure.

454
00:40:33,186 --> 00:40:36,345
Well... you don't have to decide now.

455
00:40:36,425 --> 00:40:38,864
- You wake me up if you do.
- All right.

456
00:40:38,944 --> 00:40:40,423
According to Mr Lindsay,

457
00:40:40,503 --> 00:40:43,702
we should both be in a state
of perpetual tumescence.

458
00:42:55,779 --> 00:42:58,978
- What are you doing?
- Watching you sleep.

459
00:42:59,058 --> 00:43:03,097
Looks like you both
had another punishing night.

460
00:43:04,776 --> 00:43:08,015
I wish you wouldn't creep
into our room every morning!

461
00:43:08,095 --> 00:43:09,695
We've just been for a swim.

462
00:43:09,775 --> 00:43:13,133
I just wanted to tell you
how nice the water was.

463
00:45:40,085 --> 00:45:43,244
Hello! Stop!

464
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:00,639
- What happened to you?
- You're a terrible mess.

465
00:46:00,719 --> 00:46:02,798
I went for a walk.

466
00:46:02,878 --> 00:46:06,597
- Stupidly... got lost.
- Come on.

467
00:46:06,677 --> 00:46:08,636
Plenty of room.

468
00:46:17,033 --> 00:46:21,672
- Here. Put this on.
- I don't want to dress up.

469
00:46:21,752 --> 00:46:25,511
You look as if you've been
in an orgy. Who were you with?

470
00:46:25,590 --> 00:46:26,830
No one.

471
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:30,069
Don't be a spoilsport. Please?

472
00:46:33,468 --> 00:46:36,547
Oh... all right, then.

473
00:46:43,905 --> 00:46:46,024
Fuckin' pub.

474
00:46:46,104 --> 00:46:49,783
You get fucked. And you too.
You get fucked.

475
00:46:49,863 --> 00:46:53,461
And you. You get fucked too.

476
00:46:53,541 --> 00:46:56,220
Go on and get fucked. Get fucked.

477
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:58,620
Three jugs of beer
and a créme de menthe.

478
00:47:00,419 --> 00:47:04,418
Hello? Hello?

479
00:47:04,498 --> 00:47:06,417
Sorry, lounge is closed.

480
00:47:06,497 --> 00:47:10,216
- What about them?
- Just closed a few minutes ago.

481
00:47:10,296 --> 00:47:14,135
- Well, the main bar's open.
- The main bar's for men.

482
00:47:14,894 --> 00:47:19,293
- Don't worry. Let's go.
- We came here for a drink.

483
00:47:21,092 --> 00:47:24,371
Hey, Tom! Lewis.

484
00:47:24,451 --> 00:47:27,370
Get us some drinks, will ya?

485
00:47:33,008 --> 00:47:36,327
Forget 'em. They're pretending
they don't know us.

486
00:47:37,247 --> 00:47:39,446
That boil in the
middle of your bum...

487
00:47:39,526 --> 00:47:41,886
you should have it
looked at by a doctor.

488
00:47:41,965 --> 00:47:45,684
It might go septic.
Your whole bum might fall off.

489
00:47:50,923 --> 00:47:54,361
- What if we drink outside?
- That's against the law.

490
00:47:54,441 --> 00:47:57,640
It's against the law
to be open on a Sunday.

491
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,239
Get fucked.

492
00:48:11,556 --> 00:48:14,035
One, two, three!

493
00:48:15,674 --> 00:48:18,554
- Your mother's a trade unionist?
- Yep.

494
00:48:18,633 --> 00:48:22,432
The sort that'd put people like you
up against a wall and shoot 'em.

495
00:48:22,512 --> 00:48:25,871
- My family aren't wealthy.
- What does your father do?

496
00:48:25,951 --> 00:48:29,630
- He's an antiques dealer.
- Mine was a sailor.

497
00:48:29,710 --> 00:48:31,549
He's dead.

498
00:48:33,349 --> 00:48:35,508
Taken by a shark?

499
00:48:35,588 --> 00:48:38,147
Blown to bits in a battle.

500
00:48:38,227 --> 00:48:40,706
They only ever found his foot.

501
00:48:42,266 --> 00:48:45,145
- What's funny?
- I'm sorry.

502
00:49:11,096 --> 00:49:15,935
One, two, three!

503
00:49:16,015 --> 00:49:18,414
- Let go of my foot.
- One, two, three!

504
00:49:18,494 --> 00:49:22,733
- Let go of my foot!
- One, two, three!

505
00:49:26,851 --> 00:49:28,291
You haven't caught us yet.

506
00:49:29,850 --> 00:49:33,529
All right, girls. Jiggle your biceps.
This'll be piss easy.

507
00:49:43,406 --> 00:49:45,685
Charge!

508
00:49:52,803 --> 00:49:54,882
- Hopeless!
- Pitiful!

509
00:49:55,482 --> 00:49:58,601
- Kelly O'Hara!
- Sean Connolly!

510
00:49:58,681 --> 00:50:02,599
- Seamus O'Hurd!
- Patrick O'Shaugnessy!

511
00:50:22,473 --> 00:50:26,472
I'm gonna be honest with you. I find
your lustful women preposterous.

512
00:50:26,552 --> 00:50:29,991
- That doesn't surprise me.
- I am married, Lindsay,

513
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:32,870
so I do have some experience
of the opposite sex.

514
00:50:32,950 --> 00:50:37,348
I can assure you my wife is about
as far from your debauched harridans

515
00:50:37,428 --> 00:50:39,907
as animal is from vegetable.

516
00:50:39,987 --> 00:50:42,226
And which is she, Mr Campion?

517
00:50:43,306 --> 00:50:47,305
- Sorry.
- Animal or vegetable?

518
00:50:56,942 --> 00:50:58,621
What are you doing, Giddy?

519
00:50:58,701 --> 00:51:01,980
Dancing away all my impure thoughts.
I'm filled with them.

520
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:04,059
You should be doing it.

521
00:51:04,139 --> 00:51:07,778
You need to more than me.
Oh, not you, Estella.

522
00:51:07,858 --> 00:51:11,137
She needs to more than anyone.

523
00:51:15,496 --> 00:51:18,375
Ah, the world's going round.

524
00:51:25,212 --> 00:51:28,171
What are you picturing
in your mind, Giddy?

525
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:29,891
Nothing.

526
00:51:29,971 --> 00:51:34,449
- You're getting slippery.
- What do you mean?

527
00:51:35,889 --> 00:51:40,687
I know somewhere...
where she'd be really ticklish.

528
00:51:40,767 --> 00:51:42,727
Don't.

529
00:52:18,435 --> 00:52:22,354
He leaps from rock to rock
with the grace of a mountain goat.

530
00:53:13,897 --> 00:53:18,815
- You all right?
- Rose. Yes, I'm fine, thank you.

531
00:53:18,895 --> 00:53:21,694
- Just a bit out of breath.
- Were you running?

532
00:53:22,774 --> 00:53:24,173
Walking.

533
00:53:24,253 --> 00:53:25,613
Briskly.

534
00:53:38,289 --> 00:53:41,008
I think it's time
you paid a visit to Mr Devlin.

535
00:53:41,088 --> 00:53:43,447
I don't chase men.
It's undignified.

536
00:53:47,126 --> 00:53:49,165
What's that in his hand?

537
00:53:50,605 --> 00:53:54,564
- It looks like Estella's hat.
- Yes.

538
00:53:54,644 --> 00:53:58,602
I... I lost it when I went out for
a walk. He must've picked it up.

539
00:53:58,682 --> 00:54:00,881
So that's why you were blushing
in the car.

540
00:54:00,961 --> 00:54:03,281
I was feeling ill, I told you.

541
00:54:11,118 --> 00:54:13,517
Let me go.

542
00:54:13,597 --> 00:54:15,397
You ticklish?

543
00:54:32,711 --> 00:54:34,550
Excuse me.

544
00:54:35,630 --> 00:54:38,269
Would you... please untie me?

545
00:54:40,748 --> 00:54:42,428
Please, will you untie me?

546
00:54:46,746 --> 00:54:48,906
My hands are going to sleep.

547
00:55:22,295 --> 00:55:24,174
Thank you.

548
00:55:41,529 --> 00:55:46,367
- That tunic suits you.
- I thought we might go to evensong.

549
00:55:48,366 --> 00:55:50,965
All right, I'll go and change.

550
00:55:55,524 --> 00:55:57,643
So must I.

551
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:10,679
- Where were you?
- We went into the town.

552
00:56:10,759 --> 00:56:14,358
You went to the pub.
I can smell it on your breath.

553
00:56:16,557 --> 00:56:19,156
Why are you wearing
that ridiculous outfit?

554
00:56:19,236 --> 00:56:22,755
It's... part of what they've been
using in the latest paintings.

555
00:56:22,835 --> 00:56:24,434
Yes, I'm well aware of that.

556
00:56:24,514 --> 00:56:27,194
Does this mean
you'll be doing some modelling?

557
00:56:27,274 --> 00:56:29,553
There's no need to be offensive.

558
00:56:33,072 --> 00:56:35,711
- Estella, what's wrong?
- Nothing is wrong!

559
00:56:48,587 --> 00:56:53,545
In its long history, one of
the enduring strengths of the Church

560
00:56:53,625 --> 00:56:56,584
has been its capacity
to withstand persecution,

561
00:56:56,664 --> 00:56:59,063
insult and ridicule.

562
00:56:59,143 --> 00:57:00,863
Since its inception,

563
00:57:00,943 --> 00:57:05,181
those who have sought to
mock Christians have been legion.

564
00:57:05,261 --> 00:57:09,700
Even Jesus Christ Himself
felt their lash -

565
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:14,418
on the street, in the marketplace,
even at the end on the cross.

566
00:57:14,498 --> 00:57:18,617
"Where are you now,
you King of the Jews?"

567
00:57:18,697 --> 00:57:21,536
they called out to Him in his agony.

568
00:57:21,616 --> 00:57:25,455
In every age,
still more come forward

569
00:57:25,534 --> 00:57:30,773
to scorn His name
and to defame His most sacred images.

570
00:57:30,853 --> 00:57:35,011
But true Christians,
secure in their faith,

571
00:57:35,091 --> 00:57:38,770
can identify such detractors
for what they are -

572
00:57:38,850 --> 00:57:41,609
the disciples of the devil,

573
00:57:41,689 --> 00:57:46,967
the destroyers of all
that is precious in family life,

574
00:57:47,047 --> 00:57:51,766
the harbingers of darkness and chaos.

575
00:58:26,834 --> 00:58:28,194
Please be seated.

576
00:58:32,273 --> 00:58:36,151
- What on earth is wrong with you?
- Nothing.

577
00:58:36,231 --> 00:58:41,949
What strange, deluded, conceited
creatures we human beings are.

578
00:58:43,069 --> 00:58:46,268
We think we have secrets

579
00:58:46,348 --> 00:58:48,627
but how can we have secrets
from God,

580
00:58:48,707 --> 00:58:54,106
who knows our innermost thoughts
every moment of the day?

581
00:59:04,422 --> 00:59:06,541
Giddy, what's wrong?

582
00:59:07,581 --> 00:59:11,580
He's in the studio.
He's staying there tonight.

583
00:59:12,659 --> 00:59:14,499
I'm going to seduce him.

584
00:59:15,578 --> 00:59:18,058
You're drunk.

585
00:59:18,138 --> 00:59:21,377
Did he say anything...
anything about me

586
00:59:21,457 --> 00:59:24,656
- when he untied you?
- No.

587
00:59:26,975 --> 00:59:29,134
He's too shy, you see?

588
00:59:29,734 --> 00:59:32,693
I think you should lie down
for a while.

589
00:59:32,773 --> 00:59:35,052
We're so out of touch
with our passions.

590
00:59:35,132 --> 00:59:38,971
I mean, I'm such
a bourgeois little thing,

591
00:59:39,051 --> 00:59:42,330
too scared even to reveal myself
to a painter.

592
00:59:45,369 --> 00:59:48,688
I'm going to start walking around
without any clothes on

593
00:59:48,768 --> 00:59:52,326
because, well,
clothes are just ost...

594
00:59:52,406 --> 00:59:56,405
"ostentatious figments
of middle-class imagination. "

595
00:59:56,485 --> 00:59:59,324
That's Pru's nonsense.

596
00:59:59,404 --> 01:00:02,083
It's just a bit cold tonight.

597
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:08,481
Well, I'd better go and get ready.

598
01:00:08,561 --> 01:00:11,160
This is the first day
of my new life.

599
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:13,919
No, the first night
of my new life.

600
01:00:52,467 --> 01:00:54,506
She'll have to cross the Arafura Sea.

601
01:00:54,586 --> 01:00:56,705
She'll be here in a few days.

602
01:01:02,943 --> 01:01:04,823
What are you trying to do?

603
01:01:04,903 --> 01:01:08,661
Look. This is where Amy Johnson's
got to in her plane.

604
01:01:08,741 --> 01:01:09,981
She was almost eaten by cannibals.

605
01:01:10,061 --> 01:01:13,700
What are you trying to do to Giddy?
She'll make a fool of herself.

606
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:16,819
You've seen her.
She's about to burst out of her skin.

607
01:01:16,899 --> 01:01:21,017
- She doesn't know what she's doing.
- Why are you so concerned?

608
01:01:21,097 --> 01:01:23,657
- You jealous?
- Don't be ridiculous.

609
01:01:23,737 --> 01:01:28,255
- You like him too, don't you?
- We didn't speak when he untied me.

610
01:01:28,335 --> 01:01:33,253
- You didn't need to.
- You're really shocking.

611
01:02:11,481 --> 01:02:15,480
Your characters all seem so ravenous.
Can't love ever be gentle?

612
01:02:16,559 --> 01:02:19,358
Yes, of course it can,
but I'm not painting love scenes.

613
01:02:19,438 --> 01:02:21,718
Sorry, yes - "lust scenes. "

614
01:02:21,798 --> 01:02:25,556
But there is a fierceness in desire,
isn't there? In lovemaking?

615
01:02:25,636 --> 01:02:27,396
One of life's great conundrums.

616
01:02:27,476 --> 01:02:30,155
The only one,
according to your paintings.

617
01:02:30,235 --> 01:02:32,394
I admit that the human universe

618
01:02:32,474 --> 01:02:35,633
is infinitely richer
than my meagre palette.

619
01:02:35,713 --> 01:02:39,672
For instance,
I do absolutely no justice at all

620
01:02:39,752 --> 01:02:43,350
to the nervous Nellies and
the shrinking violets, the saints...

621
01:02:43,430 --> 01:02:46,309
You're very contemptuous
of shrinking violets.

622
01:02:46,389 --> 01:02:50,508
Dear Estella,
I'm a shrinking violet myself.

623
01:02:50,588 --> 01:02:53,387
I choose to live
not in the real world but in here.

624
01:02:53,467 --> 01:02:56,546
I flee from the real world
into my little studio

625
01:02:56,626 --> 01:03:00,625
and there before me is the
unlimited canvas of my imagination.

626
01:03:00,705 --> 01:03:04,863
But your paintings,
they do go out into the real world.

627
01:03:04,943 --> 01:03:08,502
While you have a wonderful
imagination, most are stunted

628
01:03:08,582 --> 01:03:11,581
and you have no idea what effect
they'll have on people

629
01:03:11,661 --> 01:03:13,741
or what they might
incite them to. Rape?

630
01:03:13,820 --> 01:03:16,700
Mr Campion, in my opinion,

631
01:03:16,780 --> 01:03:19,978
the female body is the most
beautiful thing in the world

632
01:03:20,058 --> 01:03:25,057
and if it turns you into a ravenous
maniac I'd suggest it's a good idea

633
01:03:25,137 --> 01:03:29,295
if your wife takes the greatest care
to get undressed behind a screen.

634
01:03:30,535 --> 01:03:34,214
Estella's seen the pictures too.
Are we in danger from her?

635
01:03:34,294 --> 01:03:38,213
You're so patronizing, Mr Campion.
Everyone has a rich imagination.

636
01:03:38,292 --> 01:03:41,132
What stunts it
is capitalist exploitation.

637
01:03:41,212 --> 01:03:44,211
Go to Soviet Russia
where they've been liberated,

638
01:03:44,291 --> 01:03:46,130
there's an explosion of creativity.

639
01:03:46,210 --> 01:03:49,169
Have you been to Soviet Russia, Pru?
Have you?

640
01:03:49,249 --> 01:03:53,967
I thought for a moment someone knew
what they were talking about.

641
01:03:54,047 --> 01:03:58,566
Communism has exploded every value,
leaving a vacuum of moral anarchy.

642
01:03:58,646 --> 01:04:03,364
- Anarchy is freedom!
- Balls! Sorry. Sorry.

643
01:04:04,204 --> 01:04:06,523
Freedom for the strong
to dominate the weak.

644
01:04:06,603 --> 01:04:09,562
It's exactly as before,
just a different set of bullies.

645
01:04:09,642 --> 01:04:13,041
Speaking of bullies, where's Giddy?

646
01:04:32,115 --> 01:04:35,154
- I thought you'd lost that hat.
- Yes.

647
01:04:35,234 --> 01:04:37,873
One of the girls must've found it.

648
01:04:38,953 --> 01:04:43,831
So, um, where was Giddy tonight?

649
01:04:43,911 --> 01:04:45,910
You like her, don't you?

650
01:04:47,990 --> 01:04:50,669
"Try one of these, they're Turkish. "

651
01:04:52,348 --> 01:04:54,508
No, I just...

652
01:04:54,588 --> 01:04:57,706
I just worry about her
with those other two.

653
01:04:57,786 --> 01:05:00,626
She's drunk herself into a stupor.

654
01:05:00,706 --> 01:05:02,865
Planning to throw herself at...

655
01:05:03,864 --> 01:05:05,544
that odd-job man.

656
01:05:08,023 --> 01:05:10,382
Yes, he's quite a character,
isn't he?

657
01:05:10,462 --> 01:05:14,061
Apparently, he had a dangerous
reputation before he lost his sight.

658
01:05:14,141 --> 01:05:16,900
This whole country's dangerous.

659
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:20,939
You know, I've been mulling over
what you said to me the other night

660
01:05:21,019 --> 01:05:24,738
about... about me
thinking too highly of you.

661
01:05:24,818 --> 01:05:29,376
- I don't see either of us as saints.
- That's a relief.

662
01:05:29,456 --> 01:05:34,055
Yes, I've done plenty of things
I'm ashamed of, stretching way back.

663
01:05:34,135 --> 01:05:39,573
- What sort of things?
- I remember when I was at school,

664
01:05:39,653 --> 01:05:42,132
we had this
ridiculous initiation ceremony

665
01:05:42,212 --> 01:05:44,971
for the new boys,
the "scum" as we called them.

666
01:05:46,051 --> 01:05:49,769
- I was put through it myself.
- What happened?

667
01:05:49,849 --> 01:05:54,088
Well, we used to stand 'em
on a chair, take their trousers down,

668
01:05:54,168 --> 01:05:57,287
whip 'em with wet towels
while they recited Tennyson.

669
01:05:57,367 --> 01:05:59,886
- You know the sort of thing.
- Do I?

670
01:06:01,566 --> 01:06:06,404
Anyway, that's just...
something I wanted you to know.

671
01:06:14,121 --> 01:06:18,400
In view of... today's activities.

672
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:21,479
What are you talking about?

673
01:06:23,318 --> 01:06:26,877
I think you know,
I'd rather not put it into words.

674
01:06:55,348 --> 01:06:57,827
Sorry I'm so noisy.

675
01:06:57,907 --> 01:07:02,786
It's all right.
They'll all be asleep.

676
01:09:57,328 --> 01:09:59,648
You are the Winnie the Pooh
sleeping in today.

677
01:09:59,728 --> 01:10:02,767
- What's the time?
- Nearly three.

678
01:10:02,847 --> 01:10:04,886
Message from your friend Sheela.

679
01:10:04,966 --> 01:10:09,364
She didn't want to wake you for
swimming as you needed your rest.

680
01:10:09,444 --> 01:10:12,483
Seemed quite smug about it, actually.

681
01:10:12,563 --> 01:10:15,243
I might have one now, then.

682
01:10:16,922 --> 01:10:19,321
To wake me up.

683
01:10:19,401 --> 01:10:21,920
Right. Good idea.

684
01:10:48,312 --> 01:10:51,391
- How are you feeling?
- Really buggered.

685
01:10:51,471 --> 01:10:54,750
I woke in the night with a blanket
stuck to me like a cloak.

686
01:10:54,830 --> 01:10:56,629
I'd spilt that horrible drink.

687
01:10:56,709 --> 01:10:58,748
I looked like a huge emerald mint.

688
01:11:00,468 --> 01:11:02,347
Not that it mattered.

689
01:11:02,427 --> 01:11:05,466
- Why? What do you mean?
- I went to the studio to see him.

690
01:11:05,546 --> 01:11:09,065
He was there doing it
with somebody else.

691
01:11:09,145 --> 01:11:11,184
Who was it?

692
01:11:14,063 --> 01:11:16,902
It was dark.
I suppose it was Sheela or Pru.

693
01:11:18,022 --> 01:11:21,101
They've got absolutely no morals
at all.

694
01:11:21,181 --> 01:11:24,900
I just feel so stupid.
I thought he liked me.

695
01:11:30,458 --> 01:11:33,537
So I'm not going to have
anything to do with men any more.

696
01:11:33,617 --> 01:11:36,416
- I've made a big decision.
- What decision?

697
01:11:36,496 --> 01:11:38,775
You'll see. So will Norman.

698
01:12:04,847 --> 01:12:08,046
- Change your mind?
- Yes.

699
01:12:08,126 --> 01:12:11,405
Disappointing news.
The organisers have backed down.

700
01:12:11,485 --> 01:12:14,723
Exhibition's going ahead
with all the original paintings.

701
01:12:16,003 --> 01:12:20,322
- Still, we did our best.
- I wish we could leave now.

702
01:12:20,402 --> 01:12:22,561
That's the good news.
The track's been repaired.

703
01:12:22,641 --> 01:12:26,400
- We'll get the first train tomorrow.
- Thank goodness.

704
01:12:29,359 --> 01:12:31,478
I'll tell Lindsay.

705
01:12:46,073 --> 01:12:49,912
Sorry, just thought I'd let you know
we'll be off in the morning.

706
01:12:50,992 --> 01:12:53,351
Right.

707
01:12:58,789 --> 01:13:00,748
Right.

708
01:13:15,024 --> 01:13:19,222
You're very naughty so I'm not
going to give you this chocolate.

709
01:13:19,302 --> 01:13:23,021
Honey! Honey, come quick.

710
01:13:29,579 --> 01:13:32,138
This lamb is absolutely delicious.

711
01:13:32,218 --> 01:13:36,097
Very nearly as good as Welsh lamb
and that's saying something.

712
01:13:37,976 --> 01:13:39,976
Well, um...

713
01:13:40,056 --> 01:13:42,575
thank you very much
for your hospitality.

714
01:13:42,655 --> 01:13:44,094
Bottoms up.

715
01:13:44,174 --> 01:13:46,413
We've enjoyed ourselves.

716
01:13:46,493 --> 01:13:49,532
I like a little opposition.
It clears the mind.

717
01:13:56,770 --> 01:14:01,449
So, um, I gather
you're a boxer, Mr Devlin.

718
01:14:01,528 --> 01:14:04,448
Yes, I used to do a bit
of boxing myself, actually.

719
01:14:04,528 --> 01:14:06,887
Quite a keen pugilist in one's day.

720
01:14:06,967 --> 01:14:12,125
Lost a huge part of this tooth from
a great haymaker someone gave me.

721
01:14:12,205 --> 01:14:16,524
I expect you've got some
pretty bad scabs to show as well.

722
01:14:17,483 --> 01:14:22,642
Apart, obviously, from the...
eye thing, which is beastly.

723
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:30,079
Well, unfortunately,
during his last fight,

724
01:14:30,159 --> 01:14:33,238
Mr Devlin was gasping for air
with his tongue hanging out

725
01:14:33,318 --> 01:14:37,117
and he got this enormous uppercut
under his chin and lost most of it.

726
01:14:37,197 --> 01:14:39,876
Bulldust, Norman.

727
01:14:40,756 --> 01:14:43,675
He makes a brilliant Ulysses, anyhow.

728
01:14:43,755 --> 01:14:46,914
We always call him into the water
and he never comes.

729
01:14:46,994 --> 01:14:49,593
Whoever he was,
you'd try to get him in.

730
01:14:49,673 --> 01:14:53,671
- You'd get in the whole army.
- God, you're charming tonight.

731
01:14:53,751 --> 01:14:58,110
Thinking about the Atlantis series,
I'd like to do more research.

732
01:14:58,190 --> 01:15:01,509
I was thinking of mounting
an expedition to go and find it.

733
01:15:01,589 --> 01:15:04,028
You might like to come.

734
01:15:05,308 --> 01:15:09,666
- Devlin could be the pilot.
- Giddy could be the navigator.

735
01:15:10,306 --> 01:15:11,746
I'm not going if they're going.

736
01:15:11,825 --> 01:15:13,225
- What?
- Why not?

737
01:15:13,305 --> 01:15:15,544
I can't trust you
as far as I could kick you.

738
01:15:15,624 --> 01:15:20,103
- Thanks very much.
- What are you talking about?

739
01:15:20,183 --> 01:15:21,622
You know!

740
01:15:21,702 --> 01:15:24,821
You always eat cheese
when you're feeling guilty.

741
01:15:25,421 --> 01:15:26,861
Excuse me.

742
01:15:29,620 --> 01:15:32,619
Sorry, I'd better go and see
if she's all right.

743
01:15:36,897 --> 01:15:40,816
- What?
- Nothing.

744
01:15:44,935 --> 01:15:46,774
Piglet? You all right?

745
01:15:46,854 --> 01:15:49,253
Yes, I'm... I'm fine, thank you.

746
01:15:50,973 --> 01:15:53,372
Are you feeling a bit funny?

747
01:15:54,452 --> 01:15:56,011
Probably all that Stilton.

748
01:15:57,690 --> 01:16:00,849
You were packing it down,
weren't you?

749
01:16:05,288 --> 01:16:08,207
- Well, I'd better... I'll go back.
- Pooh.

750
01:16:10,206 --> 01:16:13,085
I think... we should talk.

751
01:16:14,885 --> 01:16:20,723
- Right you are. What about?
- Ever since we got here, I...

752
01:16:23,482 --> 01:16:26,841
Well, now, I think some things
are best left unsaid.

753
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:31,719
But that means
we'll always be strangers.

754
01:16:31,799 --> 01:16:33,999
No, not really.

755
01:16:35,798 --> 01:16:38,757
- Only small parts of us.
- The bad parts.

756
01:16:39,837 --> 01:16:42,596
No, I think it's good
to have a few secrets.

757
01:16:44,955 --> 01:16:46,874
Do you?

758
01:16:50,033 --> 01:16:51,833
That way, in 50 years' time,

759
01:16:51,913 --> 01:16:55,552
we'll still be able
to surprise each other.

760
01:16:56,471 --> 01:16:58,111
Perhaps you're right.

761
01:17:04,589 --> 01:17:06,548
I love you, Piglet.

762
01:17:38,218 --> 01:17:41,377
- What's the matter?
- You must've been dreaming.

763
01:17:41,457 --> 01:17:43,296
When you saw someone with Devlin.

764
01:17:43,376 --> 01:17:45,295
You were so drunk.

765
01:17:45,375 --> 01:17:48,894
I looked in here
and you were absolutely sozzled.

766
01:17:48,974 --> 01:17:52,693
- But it was so real.
- Dreams always are.

767
01:17:53,413 --> 01:17:55,972
The other two swear it wasn't them

768
01:17:56,052 --> 01:17:58,291
and you know how they like to boast.

769
01:17:59,571 --> 01:18:01,850
Do you still like him?

770
01:18:03,009 --> 01:18:07,768
- I suppose so.
- You should go in and see him, then.

771
01:18:07,848 --> 01:18:09,007
Now?

772
01:18:09,087 --> 01:18:13,206
That's what your dream
was telling you.

773
01:18:14,526 --> 01:18:17,685
Here, put this on.

774
01:18:17,765 --> 01:18:20,844
- But it's your wedding ring.
- It's always brought me luck.

775
01:18:20,924 --> 01:18:23,403
- Has it?
- Always.

776
01:18:23,483 --> 01:18:25,282
Wear these.

777
01:18:28,281 --> 01:18:30,241
Try some of this.

778
01:18:35,479 --> 01:18:38,198
We'll have to fix your hair.

779
01:18:52,713 --> 01:18:54,473
Good luck.

780
01:22:01,531 --> 01:22:04,290
I want to wake up now.

781
01:22:17,606 --> 01:22:21,485
- What? It was night...
- You were shouting.

782
01:22:21,565 --> 01:22:24,244
Really loudly.
I heard you from the garden.

783
01:22:24,324 --> 01:22:28,163
But I wanted to tell you about
last night. Oh, it was wonderful.

784
01:22:28,243 --> 01:22:31,522
I mean, I didn't do everything
with him because...

785
01:22:31,602 --> 01:22:34,241
I don't think
he's good enough for me but...

786
01:22:34,321 --> 01:22:37,680
oh, he did some things
which were just...

787
01:22:39,919 --> 01:22:41,358
Gosh!

788
01:22:49,716 --> 01:22:52,595
How dare you use her
without permission?

789
01:22:52,675 --> 01:22:57,233
- I don't need permission.
- It infers that she modelled!

790
01:22:58,353 --> 01:23:00,552
You cannot just put
someone in your painting!

791
01:23:00,632 --> 01:23:04,151
It's totally compromising.
She'll be outraged. I'm outraged!

792
01:23:04,231 --> 01:23:07,630
- Perhaps we ought to ask her.
- I don't need to. If she wanted...

793
01:23:07,710 --> 01:23:10,029
Anthony? What's the matter?

794
01:23:10,109 --> 01:23:13,108
Mr Lindsay has put you
in his latest painting.

795
01:23:14,428 --> 01:23:17,067
He has to paint over you
or we'll take legal action.

796
01:23:17,147 --> 01:23:21,185
He can turn you into someone else.
You'd better have a look.

797
01:23:46,137 --> 01:23:48,176
Well?

798
01:24:10,649 --> 01:24:13,248
It's a good likeness.

799
01:24:50,236 --> 01:24:55,035
Devlin, better get back
to work. Catch.

800
01:26:00,573 --> 01:26:03,212
They're asleep.

801
01:26:03,292 --> 01:26:05,252
For goodness sake!

802
01:26:09,730 --> 01:26:11,130
We'll be arrested.

803
01:26:14,888 --> 01:26:17,488
We'll be excommunicated.
