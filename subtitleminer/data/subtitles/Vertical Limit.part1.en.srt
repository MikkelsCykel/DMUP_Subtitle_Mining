"Take It To The Limit"?

2
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,749
Artist and year?

3
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,949
1975. The Eagles, of course.
Very funny.

4
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,758
That's not a song. It's ridiculous.
You made it up.

5
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:22,590
That is definitely a song.
It's a good song, and a winning song.

6
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,353
You give up?

7
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,954
On belay.

8
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:33,156
"MacArthur Park." Richard Harris.
1968.

9
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,117
1968? I didn't even think they had
recorded music back then.

10
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,232
Excuse me. I have a signed album
by Mr. Harris.

11
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,511
It was cutting-edge stuff back then.

12
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,359
Peter, check your sister's belay.

13
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,788
Want to tell him we're not 15?

14
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,508
Why bother? We'll always be 15.

15
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,231
Dad, she needs a second cam.

16
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,999
That won't hold in a fall.

17
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,116
Screw you.

18
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,469
Listen, Annie.

19
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,591
No matter how experienced...

20
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,758
...a smart climber always wears a belt
and suspenders.

21
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,110
Two cams are safe, three's better.

22
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,309
I'm not kidding. We're not moving
until you put another cam in the wall.

23
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,114
I have three cams.
He's yanking your chain.

24
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,959
Watch out!

25
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,799
Amateurs at twelve o'clock!
Check your safety!

26
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,877
Too much weight!
It's not gonna hold!

27
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,472
Hold it together, you two!

28
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,874
Now get a grip.

29
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,918
We're getting out of this.

30
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:03,076
Annie, how close to the wall are we?

31
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,394
Keep still, goddamn it!
Stop moving around! Stop!

32
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,591
Dad!

33
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,914
Both of you...

34
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,952
...keep very still.

35
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,719
Try and stay calm.

36
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,390
Annie.

37
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,359
Is the other cam moving?

38
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,869
No.

39
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,832
Try and reach the wall.

40
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,750
See if you can anchor us back in.

41
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,948
Try it.

42
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,272
It's moving!

43
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,474
Peter, get your knife.

44
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,476
What?

45
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,034
Just do as I say.

46
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,750
Get it!

47
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,476
You don't have much time here.

48
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,755
You have to do something for me.

49
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,715
Cut me loose.

50
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,031
One cam can't hold us all.

51
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,869
You have to cut me loose...

52
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,072
...or else I'll pull everybody down.
Everybody will die!

53
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,676
Shut up, Annie!

54
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,950
It's one dead or three, Peter.

55
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,513
Don't make him do this.

56
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,517
You're gonna kill your sister.

57
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,513
Annie will die if you don't.

58
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,278
- I won't do it!
- Cut the rope!

59
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,879
- I can't!
- Stop it!

60
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,390
That cam is gonna come out
and Annie and you will die!

61
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,989
- You'll kill your sister!
- Stop it!

62
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,398
Cut the damn rope!

63
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,276
It doesn't matter about me. Cut it.

64
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,509
We're out of time!

65
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,835
Don't do it!

66
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,198
No one will blame you for it!
Just cut it!

67
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,797
Annie and you are gonna die!
Just cut it, Peter!

68
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,316
We're cleared for the Siachen glacier.
A doctor's on standby.

69
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,200
I was heading there anyway.
Mail and supplies.

70
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,670
I can drop you on my way back
to K2 base camp.

71
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,710
Sounds good.

72
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,831
I tried to visit you a few days ago.

73
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,792
But the weather closed in.

74
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,114
Annie's at base camp.
Arrived last week.

75
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,354
Would you like a tea?

76
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,033
No, I'm fine.

77
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,750
You must try the tea. It's very good.
Indian, of course.

78
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,874
We may be at war with them,
but their tea's the best.

79
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,869
- Forgive me. Mr. Garrett, isn't it?
- Yes.

80
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,150
<i>National Geographic</i> is always welcome.

81
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,717
The only Westerners who come to
Pakistan without conquering something.

82
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,158
The colonel's angry. Only 25% of his
medical supplies are onboard.

83
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,033
And three days late.
Look at this place.

84
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,751
In six years, I've lost 800 men.
Not one to the enemy.

85
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,116
But the chopper was full of stuff.

86
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,993
Not for my men.

87
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,835
For Americans who can pay $3 million for
climbing permits.

88
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,753
Elliot Vaughn, the entrepreneur.

89
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:11,476
He's got 40 people with him to try K2.
I've been seconded to his team.

90
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,908
Seconded or sold?

91
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,873
That's a question only a general
in Islamabad can answer.

92
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,554
Three o'clock.
Time to wake up the Indians.

93
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,514
So Annie's coming in
with Vaughn's team?

94
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,150
She's leading a WNN documentary crew.

95
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,271
They're going up the mountain
with him.

96
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,790
Have you seen her?

97
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,829
Not yet. One of the guides told me.

98
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,031
What about Vaughn?
What's he all about?

99
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,672
Pretty much what you'd expect.
Sensitive, kind, modest.

100
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,679
Your typical billionaire.

101
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,234
Four years ago his team took
on the south face.

102
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,948
Was 800 feet from the top
when weather closed in.

103
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,709
Twenty-four hours in the death zone.

104
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,673
Next morning, he walked down.
He's a bloody good climber.

105
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,718
- Got your update, Annie.
- What's up?

106
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,150
That cyclone's tracking fast
from southeast.

107
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,311
Let me know if anything changes.

108
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,272
What are you..?

109
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,068
I just happened to be in the area.

110
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:50,277
I heard WNN hired you. And you're
hosting it. Congrats.

111
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,030
They needed someone who could climb K2
and look presentable.

112
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,309
Not much of a rush.

113
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,077
That's not true. They wanted the best.

114
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:04,079
I read about you on the Eiger.
Fastest female ascent.

115
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,115
Dad would be proud.

116
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,515
When you leaving?

117
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,872
Early tomorrow morning. We want to
be summiting by 2:00 Wednesday.

118
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,035
What does the mountain say about that?

119
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,632
I thought you laid siege to it.

120
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,235
I didn't know it could be scheduled.

121
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,675
It's a plan, Peter, that's all.

122
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,709
Vaughn's aggressive. He knows what he
wants and goes for it.

123
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,359
I admire him.

124
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,715
How long have you known him?

125
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,074
Wherever you're going with this,
you're wrong.

126
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,236
Nobody ever affects my climbing.

127
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,355
Was that two of them, Cyril?

128
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,717
Or has this stuff just gotten
better than we thought?

129
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,673
- Frank.
- Good to see you.

130
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,675
- Tommy McLaren. Colorado Kid.
- You ready to go?

131
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,279
You lead, I'll follow.

132
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,596
There's my leading lady. Hi, Annie.

133
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,474
- How was your trip?
- My stomach's still up there.

134
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,712
Luckily I passed on the eggs Benedict.

135
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,791
Excuse me for a minute.

136
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,556
Ed Viesturs.
It's an honor to meet you.

137
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,273
- Elliot Vaughn.
- Nice to meet you.

138
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,318
This guy has been up Everest five times.

139
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,797
He's climbed 12 of the world's
14 highest peaks.

140
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,792
All without oxygen.

141
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:18,596
Rock on. By comparison, all of us
are merely amateurs.

142
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,189
- It's a real honor, Ed.
- Welcome to base camp.

143
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,469
Thank you.

144
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,120
<i>Outdoors</i> magazine wants
to interview you.

145
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,789
"Bankruptcy at High Altitude."

146
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,074
How much can we...

147
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,235
Yes?

148
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,396
I could go and come back, or...

149
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,674
Looking for Skip?

150
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,915
Yeah.

151
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,039
Try the command tent.

152
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,994
Thanks.

153
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,755
Skip?

154
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,833
I'm Peter Garrett.

155
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,752
- Good to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

156
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,958
I got your message.
Bad luck about your porter.

157
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:26,114
I've got four you can meet tomorrow.
Supplies you need are no problem.

158
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,199
The Swedish hooker's taking longer
than I thought.

159
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,672
There's no shortage of entertainment.
You saw Mr. Vaughn fly in?

160
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:38,511
He's hard to miss. What's this
about his climbing to a deadline?

161
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,674
- Friend of yours?
- My sister's climbing with him.

162
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,829
Annie Garrett.

163
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:50,558
Vaughn's got this publicity stunt
for his new airline, Majestic Air.

164
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:55,311
He stands on the top of K2 waving
as the inaugural flight goes overhead.

165
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,594
Are you serious?

166
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,199
I'm deadly serious.

167
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,713
Your sister's safe. No one knows
these hills better than Tommy McLaren.

168
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,076
He told Vaughn they'd get up there.
I know I did.

169
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,955
I'd have told him anything
for $1 million.

170
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,679
Is that what he's spending?

171
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,475
That's just for Tom. Bought his
company out for the entire season.

172
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,316
Not that I'm pissed off.
Look what I get to drag to the top.

173
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:24,592
56-year-old movie producer
with dysfunctional bowel syndrome.

174
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,673
He's got the runs, mate. Permanently.

175
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,839
The Bench brothers bet
he won't make it past 18,000.

176
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,997
- What do you think?
- What do I think?

177
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,796
It depends. I'm so broke I might have
to shove him in a crevasse myself.

178
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:43,558
This is Monique, our base camp manager
and medic. Monique, Peter.

179
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,752
We've met. You should look at these.

180
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,473
Don't mind her. She's French-Canadian.

181
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,673
Some days she's Canadian
and can be quite pleasant.

182
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,911
Today, she's obviously French.

183
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,988
How about some Spanish mackerel
for the bow?

184
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,875
My name's Cyril. I'm not much,
but I'm all I think about.

185
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,879
Watch out for him, he's like a dog.
If he sees something...

186
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,875
...he tries to shag it. If he can't
shag it, he tries to eat it.

187
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,111
If he can't eat it, he pisses on it.

188
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:40,433
It's easy to tell us apart,
because I'm the shy one.

189
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,352
No, no, no, <i>señorita.</i>

190
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,000
Here you go.
Have a drink on Mr. Vaughn.

191
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,958
What time's the laser show?

192
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,599
Is this thing on?

193
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,354
Howdy!

194
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,158
Everyone hear me all right?

195
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,993
No!

196
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,398
You're the lucky ones.

197
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,392
Welcome to the highest party
in the world!

198
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,918
Okay, maybe I did overdo it
just a bit.

199
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,157
Four years ago, I came here
with a dream to climb K2.

200
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,750
The toughest mountain in the world.

201
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,233
As most of you know,
that attempt ended in tragedy.

202
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,751
On Wednesday,
with the help of Tom McLaren...

203
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,674
...I intend to fulfill that dream.

204
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:44,959
And while I'm at it, take care
of some business, Texas style.

205
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,471
At 0900 hours, Greenwich Mean Time...

206
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,951
...the inaugural flight of Majestic
Air will fly over the summit...

207
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,350
...and we'll be there to wave them on!

208
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,911
To the other teams climbing,
I'd like to say be safe...

209
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,158
...and good luck.

210
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,110
Kick up your heels
and enjoy the barbecue!

211
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,229
What about the weather, Mr. Vaughn?

212
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,400
We hope for the best.
You know something we don't?

213
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,629
The weather closes in
and people die up there.

214
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,710
Or don't you have to worry about that?

215
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:47,070
Anybody who doesn't worry
about that is a fool.

216
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,710
Brian Maki did a high-atmosphere
analysis of the last 4 decades.

217
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:56,719
Most years there's a 9-to-12-day lull
before the fall storms.

218
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,834
On August 2nd, we calculate
an 82% chance of fine weather.

219
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,039
Give me odds like that
in the oil business, I'd be rich.

220
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,955
Who's the leader, Mr. Vaughn?

221
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:14,754
Who makes decisions that mean
other people live or die?

222
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,718
Who plays God, so to speak?

223
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:22,197
There can be only one leader.
It's always the best climber.

224
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,989
I've made it clear to everyone
that Tom McLaren is that man.

225
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,112
Even the Pakistanis agree.
They're giving you a 21-gun salute.

226
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,232
Okay, let's party!

227
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,793
Thanks for that, Elliot.

228
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,389
You climb as good as you talk,
we'll get you there.

229
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,918
You know that old guy
who was asking questions?

230
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,959
Montgomery Wick.

231
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,710
Remember Dad used to talk about him?

232
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,558
They were in the service together...

233
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,472
Of course, I remember.

234
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:32,230
I miss him, Annie.
I miss him just as much as...

235
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,959
I can't talk about it.

236
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,879
You never have.

237
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,358
There's nothing to say.
He's gone, Peter.

238
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,679
Look, you can blame me all you want...

239
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,030
...but that last cam would've failed.

240
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,271
It held the two of us.

241
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,756
You want to do this?
Okay, fine, let's do it.

242
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,991
You didn't give it a chance.

243
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,914
- He knew it wouldn't hold either.
- Of course he didn't.

244
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,474
We were his life.

245
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,474
He would've died rather than take
a chance anything might happen to us.

246
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,758
I think we owed him the same.

247
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,196
But I did what I thought was right.

248
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:15,872
If you're so right, why haven't
you climbed? Or been to his grave?

249
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:22,158
I'm not going up there for a TV show.
I'm going up there for him.

250
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:25,113
I want to be the person
he always wanted me to be.

251
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,232
When I'm up there, I feel close
to him.

252
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,759
I touch his soul.

253
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,919
Take care up there.

254
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,673
This is it.

255
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,079
Wish you were going with me.

256
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:58,996
Not this time. Take care up there.
It'll be a great day for Texas.

257
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,912
And Scotland.

258
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,759
What is it?

259
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,753
Spindrift coming off the top.

260
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,631
That's local. If something was coming
in, it'd show on the other peaks.

261
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,430
Your sister's fine, man.
You look after yourself.

262
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:32,435
You too. Thanks for everything.

263
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,194
<i>Understood, Tom.</i>
<i>You guys take good care up there.</i>

264
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,273
Thanks, base. Out.

265
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,393
Well, you heard it.

266
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,196
Computer model shows it's building.

267
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,470
That's a concern.

268
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,435
We're about an hour from
the bottleneck, right?

269
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,792
Let's kick it and get up there.

270
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,958
Gets any worse,
we'll shelter under the ice cliffs.

271
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:17,755
If it comes in fast,
we're totally exposed out here.

272
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,150
It's not fast.
He said it's slow-moving.

273
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,358
There's a 70% chance
it'll turn east and miss us.

274
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:26,478
I'm not gonna risk a storm.
Not at 26,000.

275
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:30,036
We're not suggesting anything stupid.
The weather could turn.

276
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,359
The odds are with us.
We're five hours from the summit.

277
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,753
We turn back now, that's it.
We've lost our window.

278
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:40,919
I know. Elliot, I'm aware of that.
It's my responsibility.

279
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,834
I won't let a marketing campaign
compromise our safety.

280
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,474
You think this is
about a marketing campaign?

281
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,478
Come on, Tom.
This is about getting to the top.

282
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,674
I don't give a shit
about the publicity.

283
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,193
This is a life statement for me.

284
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:04,236
We're only 500 feet from
the bottleneck. Let's keep going.

285
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,075
Okay.

286
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,469
Okay.

287
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,394
Let's go.

288
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,995
980 hectopascals and falling.

289
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:46,108
Lenticular cloud to the southeast.
Winds at 80 knots, rising.

290
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,039
Tom says he's going on.
What's base camp pressure?

291
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,475
Pressure's dropped two points
in four hours.

292
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,870
You made your case. We listened.
We decided.

293
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:57,835
It's too high a risk. Why am I here
if you don't listen to me?

294
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:02,836
I'll assess the risk. As to why
you're here, I wonder myself.

295
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,317
I'm Annie's brother.
McLaren's pulling them back, right?

296
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,591
We're on target. They're going on.

297
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,077
The wind's hit to the south.
What's your satellite show?

298
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,311
We've assessed the data.
We're going up.

299
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,830
It shows bad air coming in from India.

300
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,757
What the hell are you doing?

301
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,279
- How high are they?
- 26,000.

302
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,280
- What are you doing?!
- Warning my sister!

303
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,675
Leave it! That's enough!

304
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,557
Tom McLaren, come in.

305
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,075
<i>Tom McLaren, this is base camp.</i>
<i>Do you copy?</i>

306
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,311
<i>Tom McLaren, do you read?</i>

307
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,908
Come in, base.

308
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:52,392
<i>You've got a major storm coming in.</i>
<i>You've gotta start down.</i>

309
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,189
Who is this?

310
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,471
Peter Garrett.
You copy about the storm?

311
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,712
Where's Frank Williams?
Put Frank Williams on.

312
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,830
Skip here. We're looking
at the weather screens.

313
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:11,272
<i>If this doesn't turn, you'll be in</i>
<i>big trouble. Turn back immediately.</i>

314
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,829
<i>Do you copy?</i>

315
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,918
Yeah, I copy that.
Thanks, Skip. Out.

316
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,389
How we doing?

317
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,154
I'm pulling the plug.
We're going down.

318
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,789
- Just hold on.
- I'm sorry, Elliot.

319
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,720
You pay me to make these decisions.

320
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,512
I'm paying you to get me to the top.

321
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,872
Jesus! Elliot, you told me
I was in charge up here.

322
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,514
You are! Why are you vacillating?

323
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,520
Because some second-rate guide
got on the radio?

324
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,597
Nobody knows this mountain better
than Skip.

325
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:44,759
Skip Taylor's a hustler. He was
jockeying me to be in your boots.

326
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,671
Don't crap out on me now.

327
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,679
Come on, what did you think?

328
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:54,034
She'd just lift up her skirt
and pull her panties down for us?

329
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,032
Is this how you got up Everest twice?

330
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,319
I'm going down.

331
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,390
Fine. Fine.

332
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:09,237
Go down. Go on. Sit it out.

333
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:13,076
The storm will turn and you'll spend
the rest of your life living it down.

334
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,320
That should do wonders
for your business.

335
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,830
I'm sorry, can I? Please.

336
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,757
We're going back!

337
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,958
We don't have a choice!
We are dead on the ridge! Let's go!

338
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,634
Fuck you!

339
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,590
Annie!

340
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,313
Annie, can you hear me?

341
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:51,030
I'm all right! I'm safe!

342
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,274
Elliot!

343
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:00,438
I'm fine! We're okay!

344
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,632
Avalanche!

345
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,911
Annie, are you there?
Can you hear me?

346
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,198
Come in, base, this is summit team.
Do you read me?

347
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:26,912
Anybody, do you read me? This is
the Vaughn summit team. Come in.

348
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,509
Summit team, this is base camp.
Do you copy?

349
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,635
Summit team, this is base camp.

350
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,151
If you're gonna do that,
do it outside.

351
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,997
Base, this is summit team.
Are you trying to contact us?

352
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,752
Here. Let me.

353
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,554
Oh, my God. That's Morse code.

354
00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:00,798
My dad taught us when we were kids.
Said it could save your life.

355
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,551
Smart man, your father.

356
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,239
He sure was.

357
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,399
There's three of them.

358
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,268
Vaughn.

359
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,675
Tom.

360
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,435
Annie.

361
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,074
I'm sorry, Kareem.

362
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,112
You say there are three.

363
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,837
Maybe there are others.

364
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,948
Maybe.

365
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:12,279
Tell them we can't keep talking.
We gotta save power.

366
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,355
He's right.

367
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,392
What's he saying, Annie?

368
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,238
They're coming to get us.

369
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:28,116
It's not just snow.
It's gonna be ice and rock.

370
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,552
We need special tools.
I don't know how much we have here.

371
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:34,235
Then how do you get it
up there, Mr. Garrett?

372
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,075
Then we dig with our bare hands
if we have to.

373
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:43,512
Whatever it takes. We have more than
enough guys here to get this done.

374
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,555
What the hell do you want to do?
Just leave them there?

375
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:57,910
Peter.

376
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,879
You can't ask people to work there.

377
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,957
That high, just staying alive is...

378
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,874
So we just walk away
and forget about them?

379
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:13,112
They had one fuel can each. They can
melt ice and rehydrate for a day.

380
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,476
At 26,000, without it,
their lungs fill with fluid.

381
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,752
That's pulmonary edema,
they die within another 12.

382
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:22,077
That gives us a window of 36 hours.

383
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,039
Montgomery Wick.

384
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,797
Wick speed-summited in 24.

385
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,553
We're not Montgomery Wick.

386
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:39,031
Even if we were, how long does that
leave to get through the rock and ice?

387
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:46,075
We don't know their exact location.
How long will that take?

388
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,712
I won't let Annie die.

389
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,153
So what are we gonna do?

390
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,515
Nitroglycerin, Mr. Garrett.

391
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,189
I wouldn't touch it
with an English barge pole.

392
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:46,398
We use it to blast rock
for gun emplacements.

393
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:49,433
It's low-freezing
and more powerful than symtex.

394
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,111
My responsibility ends at that door.

395
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,671
I want to make one thing clear.
This is your decision.

396
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,190
It's got nothing
to do with the Pakistani army.

397
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:02,393
Which is a legal way of saying
I think it's madness.

398
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,830
A magnificent madness, though.

399
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,235
Good luck.

400
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:10,269
Stop!

401
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:14,079
Skip, don't move your feet.

402
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,792
Everybody keep very still.

403
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:30,394
Okay, Skip.

404
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:34,837
Let me get this straight.
You want to go up that hill...

405
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:38,191
...with nitro on your back
and hope that it doesn't jolt?

406
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:39,550
That's right.

407
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,430
A hundred thousand sperm
and you were the fastest?

408
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:51,033
Skip here's agreed to go,
so I need four more.

409
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:54,557
It'll be a speed ascent,
in pairs, one canister per team.

410
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:58,915
People have to share?
Won't everyone want their own bomb?

411
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:05,430
Ed.

412
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,717
You're the best climber here.

413
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:12,271
I'm not one to walk away,
but I think it's suicide.

414
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,073
If we just leave them,
what do you call that?

415
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:17,597
It's reality. You're willing
to risk six lives to save three?

416
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:19,308
How do you feel about that?

417
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:20,788
The same way you do.

418
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:25,636
Your best friend died on Everest.
What if it was him up there right now?

419
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,159
I will go.

420
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,833
Ali is my cousin. It is my duty.

421
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:47,191
How about it, Mal? You and Cyril
have been up there before.

422
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:50,069
No...

423
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:51,952
Why would we want to leave this place?

424
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:54,351
Luxurious accommodation.
Fine cuisine.

425
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:56,511
Sultry weather.
Frostbite's off my dick.

426
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:59,638
I reckon we should wait
until they chuck in a ski lift.

427
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:03,276
Good idea. Imagine coming to the
Himalayas and actually climbing.

428
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:06,557
Especially when you have
to complete your autobiography.

429
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:11,356
And rustle up those all-important
endorsements. You wankers!

430
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:17,595
What's bloody wrong with you?!

431
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:19,633
We're in.

432
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,514
Thank you.

433
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:26,828
I need one more.

434
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:38,393
I'll write a check now
for anyone who goes.

435
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:42,389
Whether Elliot makes it or not,
I'll be waiting when you get back.

436
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,790
Half a million bucks.

437
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:52,794
Does that include the tip?

438
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:19,831
My brother's got explosives.
They're gonna blast their way down.

439
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:21,873
Blast their way down.

440
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,879
How are they gonna find us?
We might as well be on Mars.

441
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:31,038
It's not a question of how,
it's how long.

442
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:35,195
It's time that's gonna kill us.
We have to lay down a schedule.

443
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:37,438
A regimen we all adhere to.

444
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:40,270
Edema sets in
if we don't keep drinking.

445
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:43,956
Now, I figure, three water bottles...

446
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:45,798
...that's half a cup each,
every 2 hours.

447
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:50,073
After that, fuel cells to melt ice,
and finally...

448
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,958
...we use the dex syringes.

449
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:55,674
Chances are we're all gonna get
pretty sick...

450
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:59,197
...but if we keep to the schedule,
keep to it...

451
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:00,948
...maybe we can hold out.

452
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:07,311
Annie, we need to give them the grid
reference for our last known position.

453
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:11,673
She says they were about 300 feet
above the Anvil, heading down east.

454
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:13,633
The shoulder ice field.

455
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:16,155
I checked their manifest.
This is what they have.

456
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:20,513
We leave at dawn.
They got 22 hours if they're lucky.

457
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,074
How high can we chopper in?

458
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,119
Rasul says 21,000.
Any higher, the air's too thin.

459
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,317
He drops us.
How fast can we get there?

460
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:31,838
Negrotto Col's the only place we can
land. From there, 27 hours.

461
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:43,153
Five hours short.

462
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:50,196
We need Montgomery Wick. He's the
only man who's done it faster.

463
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,355
Will he do it?

464
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:58,232
Four years ago, a big storm blows
an American team off the hill.

465
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:02,229
There's nine up there, including
his wife. She was a guide.

466
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:06,878
He knows he can't help her, but he
goes anyway. The only one who did.

467
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:11,352
He lost all his toes to frostbite
but dragged 3 guys off the mountain.

468
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:14,917
They owe their lives to him.
What do you reckon?

469
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:17,396
Where is he?

470
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:21,635
On the mountain.
Up the shoulder, where he always goes.

471
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:25,236
They never found his wife's body,
so he keeps looking.

472
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:27,033
The guy's a lunatic.

473
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:29,639
That's just what we need.

474
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,915
Yeah. Strap on the nitro.

475
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:58,834
That's a great idea.
Smoking next to the nitro.

476
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:03,033
Although, bro and I always hoped
that you'd blow us.

477
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:28,948
Why are you going?

478
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:30,918
The money, of course.

479
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:34,590
Skip hasn't paid anyone in months.
You know of a better way out?

480
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:37,599
Can you climb?

481
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:42,590
Peter wants to know if I can climb.

482
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:46,233
Worst I've seen.
Couldn't climb a ladder.

483
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:48,639
You're that good, huh?

484
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:53,914
Yeah. But it was a very tall ladder.

485
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:11,711
What the hell are you doing?

486
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,709
I'm trying to kiss my ass goodbye.

487
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:29,753
It's dawn.

488
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:32,520
If the weather's cleared,
they'll be on their way.

489
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,074
I know.

490
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:36,629
Thank you.

491
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:39,798
And your brother?

492
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,752
Has he climbed since Utah?

493
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:45,075
No.

494
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:49,789
People say he lost his nerve.

495
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:52,312
Have you heard that?

496
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:55,558
Yeah, I've heard that.

497
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:18,836
Annie!

498
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:21,110
It's a pack! Quick!

499
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,632
I'm not interested.

500
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:04,395
You went before.
Men owe you their lives.

501
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:07,108
Four years ago.
Now I just climb for myself.

502
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:12,431
My father was a climber. Royce
Garrett. He climbed Everest with you.

503
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:16,116
I don't care. I don't live my life
so you can look up to me.

504
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:17,833
My sister's dying up there.

505
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:20,429
Before you lecture me,
get your facts straight.

506
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:22,358
It'll be less embarrassing.

507
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:25,956
Up there, you're not dying,
Mr. Garrett. You're dead.

508
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,632
What the hell happened to you?

509
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,231
Vaughn's people are offering $500,000
to anyone that goes.

510
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,271
Maybe that'll make a difference.

511
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:41,839
Why would they do that?

512
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:43,393
He's one of them.

513
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:53,158
What's their supply situation?

514
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:54,634
Enough for 22 hours.

515
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:56,193
Twenty-two.

516
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:58,159
Who's coordinating at base?

517
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:00,590
- Vaughn's people.
- That's a mistake.

518
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:05,271
I'll need someone there I can trust.
Taylor, you know the mountain best.

519
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:08,353
Skip's one of the best climbers.
We'll need him.

520
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:11,751
Let's agree on one thing:
This is not a climbing democracy.

521
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:14,679
On a rescue, we don't vote,
question or argue.

522
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:18,190
You listen and do exactly as I say.
Chopper will take you back.

523
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:30,832
Here's how we'll split it up.
Malcolm, you'll climb with Kareem.

524
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,395
- Cyril, you'll...
- What? No, I bloody won't.

525
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:37,711
You've been up the mountain too long
and forgotten the rules.

526
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:39,751
Never eat at a place called "Ma's"...

527
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:42,633
...don't play cards
with a fellow named Doc...

528
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:46,549
...and never climb with a stranger.
I'm going with my brother.

529
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:49,788
Frankly, I'd rather climb
with the Sheila.

530
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:53,712
My rules: I put a strong climber
with a weaker one.

531
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,751
You'll climb with Kareem.

532
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,675
Mr. Garrett,
you'll be climbing with me.

533
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:02,308
Cyril. Guess what?

534
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,990
Come on, darling.
Give us a smile, eh!

535
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:09,351
It's the second best thing
you can do with your lips.

536
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:18,519
We'll take the west ridge.
Cyril, the Mushroom.

537
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:20,392
Malcolm, Hockey Stick Gully.

538
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:22,358
Speed up all of them is the same.

539
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:00,270
We're as high as I can take you!

540
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:23,235
Move it! I can't hold it for long!

541
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:54,430
Next!

542
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:21,359
<i>I'm having trouble</i>
<i>maintaining altitude.</i>
