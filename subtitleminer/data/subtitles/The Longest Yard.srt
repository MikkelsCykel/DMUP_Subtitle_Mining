1
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,399
<i>...nails Harrison, and drags him down
as if he were gonna hog-tie him, too.</i>

2
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,318
<i>JB Logan helped out.</i>

3
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:17,308
<i>Anderson's ninth tackle,
he has two behind the line of scrimmage.</i>

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,875
<i>Give Harrison four yards
to the twenty-six.</i>

5
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,152
<i>Stoney Walker's coming in
and Rufus Middleton is going out,</i>

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,793
<i>giving Middleton a breather.</i>

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,515
<i>Boy, has he been burning up
a few miles today on stadium turf.</i>

8
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,871
<i>Rufus Middleton. All right,
it's second and six on the twenty-six.</i>

9
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:36,312
<i>Stoney Walker deployed wide right, Larry
Singer left. The line is set. The snap...</i>

10
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,273
How long do we have to keep
watching this crap?

11
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,835
<i>...tumbled down
on the twenty-three. A quick trap.</i>

12
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,430
<i>He had room to run except
for that man from Jacksonville,</i>

13
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,474
<i>James Washington La Croix,
who made a good, sure, low tackle,</i>

14
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,592
<i>just as Harrison was about to spurt
deep into the secondary.</i>

15
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,519
<i>We've had quite an exciting
ball game this afternoon...</i>

16
00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:01,317
Only a moron could sit and watch
two football games one after the other.

17
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,750
<i>Victorio covers him there.
Singer left.</i>

18
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,837
<i>It's about time
Robinson went to Singer.</i>

19
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,679
<i>Harrison and Mancuso
are split behind Robinson.</i>

20
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,553
<i>Robinson gives instead to Harrison,
up the middle again.</i>

21
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,991
<i>He may have the first down,
he's close to the 20-yard line.</i>

22
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,997
<i>Let's see where they mark the ball.</i>

23
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,751
<i>Billy Jacoby and Sonny Anderson again
making the tackle. It's going to be...</i>

24
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,111
Thank God.

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,994
That feels so good.
I feel so relaxed.

26
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,155
You know the help is off, Crewe.

27
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,191
The phones are off.

28
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,872
We're all alone.

29
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,630
Let's get it on, honey. Come on.

30
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,752
- Honey.
- What?

31
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:54,112
Wake up, baby. Come on.
You know it'll be good.

32
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,869
You know how good it is.
Come on, Crewe.

33
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,911
Get off me!

34
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,799
Son of a bitch.

35
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,832
Where are you going?

36
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,957
- Splitting.
- Splitting?

37
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,950
You split when I tell you to split,
you All-American son of a bitch.

38
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,991
Lovely, lovely.

39
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,113
And when you walk out, stay out.

40
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,595
You're too expensive to be useless.

41
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,994
Whore!

42
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:48,434
- That's exactly what you are, a whore.
- I never looked at it that way before.

43
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,517
Everybody's bought you.

44
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,030
Colleges, the pros, your gamblers.

45
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,470
Who bought those
beautiful caps on your teeth,

46
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,399
the clothes you're wearing
and the bloody tan you've got?

47
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,033
Me!

48
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,431
Have I ever neglected to thank you,
Melissa?

49
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,278
You has-been.

50
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,034
Where're your keys?

51
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,119
If I took everything back... Forget
my keys! You'd be bare-assed naked.

52
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:17,233
- Where're your goddamn keys?
- Don't touch my keys.

53
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,993
I think the love
has gone out of our relationship.

54
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,633
Bastard.

55
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,034
Don't you take my Masseratti.

56
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,470
I earned it.

57
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:39,428
I told you not to touch
my goddamn car!

58
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,234
Police.

59
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:06,358
- Do you have a driver's licence?
- What, are you taking a poll?

60
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,950
Well, look what we got here.
A miniature cop.

61
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,512
Can we see your driver's licence?

62
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,634
What?

63
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,149
Can we see your driver's licence?

64
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,432
See if I can get it out.

65
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,919
It's him all right.

66
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,076
Why'd you dump her car in the Bay?

67
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,078
- What?
- Why'd you dump her car in the Bay?

68
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,840
I couldn't find a car wash.

69
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,398
Step away from the bar.

70
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,834
Mister, step away from the bar!

71
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,793
Don't get pushy, cowboy.

72
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,554
- Turn it around.
- Come on!

73
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,233
- Hold that son of a bitch!
- Damn!

74
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,319
Now we got you
for stealing a car, drunken driving,

75
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,159
drunk in public and resisting arrest.

76
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,871
- Want something else?
- Yeah. I'm going to make you taller.

77
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,037
OK, men, let's go.

78
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,996
Good afternoon.
Where are you from?

79
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,749
- Palm Beach County.
- Thank you, sir. Second door down.

80
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,634
This way, men.

81
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,628
They gave you $10,000
for shaving off your moustache on TV?

82
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,068
How about giving me $5,000 worth?

83
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:02,198
Coming right off: There's about
twenty-five hundred, three thousand,

84
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,038
four thousand coming up,

85
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,515
five thousand!

86
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,960
- Anything else, sir?
- That's it.

87
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,719
Warden Hazen thinks
you're pretty hot stuff.

88
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,348
But I'm Captain Knauer.

89
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:13,792
I'm going to spell
things out for you. I run this prison.

90
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,193
He sits there growing old.
I'm out here busting heads.

91
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,991
And I run the football team.

92
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,113
- What football team?
- My football team.

93
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,274
Oh.

94
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,913
Now, Hazen's going to ask you
to help coach.

95
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,634
And you just tell him, "No way".

96
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,879
Know something?

97
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,831
I don't like you.

98
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,555
You understand that?

99
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,591
Oh, yeah.

100
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,716
<i>Attention Cell Block 3 A. Please report
as scheduled to your period assignment,</i>

101
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,229
<i>except for carpentry
and accounting classes.</i>

102
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:07,798
<i>All men assigned to farm detail will
meet at one o'clock in the Rotunda.</i>

103
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,037
Warden, Captain Knauer's here
with inmate Crewe.

104
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,911
<i>- Send him in.
- Thank you, sir.</i>

105
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,279
- You can go in now.
- Thank you, Miss Toot.

106
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,397
Paul Crewe.

107
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,511
The Wrecking Crewe.

108
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,792
- It's good to have you here.
- Thank you.

109
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:55,073
Young people can learn a great deal
from a skilful football game.

110
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:59,751
Offence, defence,
spirit of achievement, teamwork.

111
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,796
You might say...

112
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:16,039
...the game embodies
what has made our country great.

113
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,191
It's a great game.
It's played by great men.

114
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:29,555
We have something of a football team
here ourselves, you know.

115
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,636
First rank, semi-pro,
South-eastern League.

116
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:38,150
Runner-up, National Champions,
past five years.

117
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:43,308
Mister Crewe,
what do you think of semi-pro ball?

118
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,556
Semi-pro's a joke.

119
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:55,715
Well, perhaps we could use
a few pointers from the big leagues.

120
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,596
Captain, what do you say
to Mister Crewe here looking in,

121
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,678
giving us the benefit
of his invaluable knowledge?

122
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:09,399
That's a real good idea, Warden.
We could use all the help we can get.

123
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,952
Well?

124
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,199
I haven't held a football in eight
years. I'm not in very good shape.

125
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,153
Nobody's asked you to play,
Mister Crewe.

126
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,956
What we need is a coach. New blood.

127
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,878
New game plan.

128
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,475
Anybody who was pro football's
Most Valuable Player is special,

129
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,319
and I want to have that.

130
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,031
I'm not interested in football anymore.

131
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,993
Mister Crewe, I don't mind saying,

132
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,228
I pulled a lot of strings
to get you down here.

133
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,673
I appreciate that.

134
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,151
Look.

135
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,477
What I want is a national title.

136
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,679
If, perchance, you should help us
achieve that goal,

137
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,556
I expect your stay here
with us will be very agreeable.

138
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,274
Well?

139
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:22,159
I just want to do my time,
then get out of here.

140
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,593
Very well.

141
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:35,550
All right, I'll turn you over
to the good hands of Captain Knauer.

142
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,352
Swamp reclamation.

143
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,839
Get him out of here.

144
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,830
- Captain.
- Yes, sir.

145
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,837
I'd like a word with you.

146
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,315
For the past five years,
you've promised me the national title,

147
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,795
<i>and every year,
you've come up short.</i>

148
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,470
<i>- I try, sir.
- When I want an answer, I'll indicate.</i>

149
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,477
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

150
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,352
<i>You've asked for bonus money.</i>

151
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,313
Certainly take their football
seriously, don't they?

152
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:14,753
<i>This year you've asked for new
game uniforms. I've OK'ed them.</i>

153
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,391
Everything you've asked for,
I've given you.

154
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,319
Yes, sir. And I appreciate it, sir.

155
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,149
I want that title.

156
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,591
You'll give me that title,
or you'll be out of a job.

157
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:31,156
You and all that
over-priced beef you call a team.

158
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,033
We should be
in the Superbowl by now!

159
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,873
<i>I've lost patience! The gravy train is
over! This year you're going to win!</i>

160
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,399
You've lovely hair.

161
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:45,435
<i>...your last chance! Prison is no
different from any other community.</i>

162
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,112
Ever find any spiders in it?

163
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,231
<i>...then I haven't done my job.</i>

164
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,790
I'm not being unreasonable, am I?

165
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,240
- No, sir.
- Then you'll give me the title?

166
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,795
- Yes, sir.
- Good!

167
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,669
I want that man out there.

168
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:08,749
And I want you to make
that son of a bitch enthusiastic!

169
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:14,469
- Ever do it standing up?
- Let's move it.

170
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,109
- I say forget football, you do it.
- Why are you so mad?

171
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:31,952
- You better start taking life seriously.
- I did exactly what you told me to do.

172
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,794
Hey, Superstar.
Get a good night's sleep?

173
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,150
Too bad you missed breakfast.
It was yummy!

174
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,673
Gotta get it done.

175
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,795
- This is make-work day.
- What's make-work day?

176
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,230
You shovel it in
and shovel back out again.

177
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,557
Hustle in there now.
Cover that bank.

178
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,115
Get that wheelbarrow, Woody.

179
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,638
Let's go. Single file.

180
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:18,628
Hang it up, hang it up.
Let's get covered.

181
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,437
All right, let's go. Come on.

182
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,471
Get a shovel.

183
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,559
Hey, Superstar.

184
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,998
I got an idea. Granny.

185
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,112
You ever work with a nigger before?

186
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,272
Get another shovel there, boy.

187
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,394
All right. Let's go.

188
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,911
Heave it up!

189
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,955
- Sitting down, boss?
- Not today, boy.

190
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,673
- Wiping off, boss?
- Not today, boy.

191
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:25,079
- Rolling one, boss?
- Not yet, boy.

192
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:29,192
Now you know
how black man's work feels.

193
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,879
How do you like it?

194
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,230
Oh, it sort of grows on you.

195
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,998
No talking there, Granny.

196
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:40,157
- Yes, boss.
- You'll find yourselves in bad time.

197
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,194
Yes, boss. Sorry about that, boss.

198
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,279
What's he think this is, good time?

199
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:51,837
Looky, looky, looky,
here comes cooky!

200
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,510
Big deal. Look at him now.

201
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,317
How do you like them apples,
Superstar?

202
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,439
Move the line.

203
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,956
Real friendly types
you got around here.

204
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:04,869
- Might be your own fault.
- Oh, really?

205
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:08,914
Most of these old boys have nothing.
Never had nothing to start with.

206
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,749
But you, you had it all.

207
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,396
Then you let your team-mates down,
got caught taking bribes.

208
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,158
- I did, did I?
- I ain't saying either way.

209
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,920
I'm just saying
you could've robbed banks, sold dope,

210
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,635
stole your grandmother's pension,
and none of us would've minded.

211
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:31,356
But shaving points off a football game,
that's un-American.

212
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,551
You take football
real serious down here.

213
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,796
- Mind if I ask you one question?
- Yeah, I do.

214
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,991
Why'd you do it?

215
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,876
- It's a long story.
- Well, I got eight years.

216
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:02,150
Oh, my God.
What the hell is that?

217
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:06,114
That's a member
of the warden's football team.

218
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,074
Some of these guards are not
just everyday run-of-the-mill guards.

219
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,437
Crewe! Granville! Front and centre.

220
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,710
What now?

221
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:23,232
That means we don't get
to finish this delicious lunch.

222
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,553
What's he looking for?

223
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,319
Snakes.

224
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,795
- Snakes?
- Yeah.

225
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,915
Take five!

226
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,599
- Rolling one, boss?
- Not today, boy.

227
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,159
Jeez!

228
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,757
- Terrific.
- Football faggot!

229
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,076
- Salt pill up here, boss?
- Go get it, boy.

230
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,996
How long you been in this asylum,
Pop?

231
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,792
Thirty-four years.

232
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,116
- Thirty-four years?
- Yep.

233
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,437
Last six and a half
right here in the swamp.

234
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:49,030
Too old for reclamation,
so they made me barracks chief.

235
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,673
Aren't you coming up
for parole soon?

236
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:59,035
Thirty years ago, I made the mistake
of slugging a fish bull. Hazen.

237
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,918
Just my luck he made warden.

238
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:09,195
Sent me out here when I was 64 to die,
but I've been hanging on.

239
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:14,110
We'll all be in the same place a thousand
years from now, so what the hell.

240
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,551
Yeah. What the hell.

241
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,794
All right, you assholes.
Back to work.

242
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,757
Hey!

243
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,994
This ain't no country club, Superstar.
Move your ass.

244
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,508
No, no, son.
You've got to get off the bunk.

245
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,632
Man, for God's sake, get up.

246
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,838
On your feet.

247
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:57,070
Listen to me. Nobody's allowed on the
bunks till five minutes before lights out.

248
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,753
They'll put you in the oven.

249
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,389
Man, that can kill you.

250
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,079
Did you have any supper yet?

251
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,713
No.

252
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,150
Later I'll try to get you some chow.

253
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:17,750
You got to eat, man,
or you'll die of mono.

254
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,874
And they could care less.

255
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,835
- Get off me!
- Hey, watch it, man!

256
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,837
Where the hell you going?

257
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:38,630
Twinkle, twinkle, little Superstar.

258
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,552
- Guard.
- Yeah?

259
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,355
I want to see the warden.

260
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,073
Pass the salt.

261
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,517
Boy.

262
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,434
Come on.

263
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,791
Go, baby!

264
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:30,078
That's going to get you
twenty-four hours in the hot box, boy.

265
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,070
I quit.

266
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,871
What makes you so tough?

267
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,398
I don't know. It just comes natural.

268
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,990
That'll cost you, boy.

269
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,838
Rise and shine.

270
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,038
Rise and shine.

271
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,597
Oh. It's room service.

272
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,677
Pretty gamey.

273
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:33,439
Shower and put on some clean whites.
The warden wants to see you.

274
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:37,110
- The warden?
- Get on down there.

275
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,718
Well?

276
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,557
- What do you think of my team?
- Mean.

277
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,997
Crude, but mean.

278
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:03,433
I was depending on you, you know.

279
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:08,794
Well, there's so little time left now,
it's quite a problem.

280
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:13,196
They need something
before that first game.

281
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,557
- You have to win the first game?
- Right.

282
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,637
Well, it's relatively simple.

283
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:24,594
Yeah. Get yourself a tune-up game,
you know?

284
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,791
A what?

285
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,279
A tune-up game, like the pros have,
with a hungry team not in your league.

286
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,313
You bring them here
and kick the shit out of them.

287
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,514
Well.

288
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:43,588
How do you think
we'd do against the pros?

289
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,234
- That team against the pros?
- Yeah.

290
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:49,591
You'd have a real problem.

291
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:54,828
Well, how do you think
we'd do against the cons?

292
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,395
- I didn't know they had a team.
- They don't.

293
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,512
But you've given me an inspiration.

294
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,838
I've decided, Mister Crewe, that
you're going to put one together for me.

295
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:10,191
For that little tune-up game, you know?

296
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,392
And you're going to play quarterback.

297
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,793
I can't.

298
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,790
Why? They're semi-pro,
you said yourself. A big joke.

299
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,197
That's why people like me around,
my sense of humour.

300
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:30,279
Mister Crewe,
as old Mister Sam used to say,

301
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:35,793
"In this institution,
to get along, you go along."

302
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,794
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

303
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,959
I'm just going to do what's left
of my eighteen months quietly,

304
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,718
and I'm out of here.

305
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:50,515
Oh, yes. Eighteen months.

306
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:56,152
But that is to make parole.

307
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,753
That was before you struck
Captain Knauer.

308
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:07,797
Your basic sentence
is from two to five years.

309
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,070
You could be here a long time.

310
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,835
If I get this team together, how long
do I have to get them organized?

311
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,393
Four weeks.

312
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,512
- We're talking about early parole?
- I believe we are.

313
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,717
All right. I'll play.

314
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,319
What? I didn't hear.

315
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,234
- I'll play.
- Sir.

316
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,635
I'll play, sir.

317
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:53,829
History. I read you
like a book, Mister Crewe.

318
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,673
One more thing.

319
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,598
What is it?

320
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,314
You keep Knauer off my back.

321
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,588
Give us a game, Mister Crewe.

322
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,196
I'll give you a game.

323
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,753
"Hit and be hit".

324
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:19,398
"Anyone with any experience
or desire. Prison football team sign-up".

325
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,559
- Well, what do you think?
- No!

326
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,558
- Maybe I'll get annihilated. Forget it.
- He's right.

327
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,716
Now, wait a second. Hey!

328
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,956
Here's how I look at it.

329
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,515
Suppose you break your leg
or something.

330
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,474
That's six weeks easy time in
the hospital. That's biscuits and gravy.

331
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,072
Tell me something.
Would they let me play tackle?

332
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,554
Sure.

333
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,594
So I'd spend half the time looking
directly into Walking Boss's eyes?

334
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:49,918
- Now you got it.
- I've always had a thing for him.

335
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,754
Walking Boss
always had a thing for you.

336
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,635
Hold it! Don't you guys know
a good thing when you see it?

337
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:00,913
You get a free crack at the guards,
even a chance to kill one.

338
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,873
- Legal!
- Bullshit! I ain't signing that damn thing.

339
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:07,231
Come on, everybody.
When Rotka's right, he's right.

340
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:14,119
This honky golden boy sold out
his own team-mates, didn't he?

341
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,594
Damn sure did.

342
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,791
- Did it once, he'll do it again.
- Right.

343
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,434
Hi.

344
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,314
Hi.

345
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,638
- You know you're doing it all wrong?
- Yeah?

346
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:42,150
Yeah. You'll never put
a team together with that bunch.

347
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,590
Well, I appreciate the advice.

348
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,314
I can help you.
I'm Nate Scarboro.

349
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,236
- Nate Scarboro, Giants?
- Yeah.

350
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:00,071
- Step into my office.
- Thank you.

351
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:04,275
- I'm Paul Crewe.
- Yeah, I know.

352
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,071
- You made All Pro, didn't you?
- Right.

353
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,874
- Why'd you quit?
- It was simple.

354
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:13,390
Doc said, "Quit football or walking".
Too many knee operations.

355
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,114
I figured walking was
better than sitting.

356
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,390
Maybe I made the wrong choice.

357
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:24,118
You got about 15 guys worth a damn.
The rest... How long did Hazen give you?

358
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,359
- A month.
- Oh, you bought a bill of goods!

359
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,312
Didn't have any choice.

360
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,757
You don't have one black player.

361
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,032
There are at least 15 here with
enough experience to make this club.

362
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,353
None signed up.

363
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:43,029
I played eleven years in
the league, never even got a hangnail.

364
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,390
I'm not going to get hurt in this game.

365
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:48,797
I'm getting the biggest guys I can
and surrounding myself.

366
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,275
I've watched the guards play
for eleven years.

367
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,596
I've seen how they won
and why they lost.

368
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,395
I know those bums
better than they know themselves.

369
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:02,757
You just got yourself a job.
Head coach.

370
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,992
Great bunch of guys you got.

371
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:10,996
"Strangled both wives with panty hose".

372
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,749
"Triple murder
including body dismemberment".

373
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,951
"Hacked mother with meat cleaver".

374
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,434
Charming.

375
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,598
Double-check the ones with two stars.
They're the most violent.

376
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,153
Got any three-stars?

377
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,872
Damn it, Warden,
I think this game's a big mistake.

378
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:35,632
Captain, not only will you have the
chance to hone our team to a fine edge,

379
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,957
you'll also have the opportunity
to learn a great deal about life.

380
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:42,948
Why is it, do you suppose,

381
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,515
that I can walk through this yard,

382
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,188
surrounded by hate,

383
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,675
and in total command?

384
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:56,432
Because you've got fifteen gun turrets
all around you that say you can.

385
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,154
Partly, partly.

386
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:07,791
They could grab us right now
and slit our throats, but they don't.

387
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,551
We get the right person, right place,
right time, we can surprise them.

388
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:16,435
One game, one time. We can do it.

389
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,279
Hey, you guys about through?
Time's almost up.

390
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,754
OK, Pop. Hold on.

391
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,437
You better hurry up.
What have you got for me, Sunshine?

392
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:28,631
I can get you steroids, vitamins,
greenies, anything you want.

393
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,796
I'm the best hustler in the joint.

394
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:35,316
How much of what he says
can he do?

395
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,715
He can get you laid in here.

396
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,115
With a woman.

397
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:44,309
- What more can I tell you?
- Oh, yeah?

398
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,715
But can you get me
the guards' medical files?

399
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,595
- What for?
- To find out who's had broken bones.

400
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,473
Sonny Tannen, strong as an ox.
You'll love him.

401
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:59,319
- That him?
- That's him.

402
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,476
Hello, Sonny.
How'd you like to play some football?

403
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:09,240
Football?

404
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,434
Would you like that?

405
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:15,474
You mean, we'd really
get to hit the guards?

406
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,318
You like that, Sonny?

407
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,758
Report to the practice field
tomorrow morning, nine o'clock.

408
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,472
Cool it!

409
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,753
- What's his name?
- Indian.

410
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:44,636
- That makes sense.
- Now, don't do any ethnic jokes.

411
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,598
- Indian, this is Paul Crewe.
- Hi.

412
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,836
I hear you play some football.

413
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,871
- Little bit.
- Where?

414
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,833
- Oklahoma State.
- Oklahoma State U?

415
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,634
- Prison.
- Yeah.

416
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:07,037
First, we get you out of here
and on the football team.

417
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,514
How?

418
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,993
Well, we'll work on it.

419
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:22,354
That pretty heavy?

420
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,519
About 400 pounds.

421
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,594
That's pretty heavy.

422
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,554
George Samson Granada.
Mister Florida 1964.

423
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,119
Paul Crewe.

424
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,117
- You know Florida?
- Yeah.

425
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:41,359
Yeah, they got tough cops here.
Small, but tough.

426
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:44,358
We're getting up a football game
against the guards.

427
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:49,839
Wondered if you and some of your
buddies here would like to join in.

428
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,793
With the guards?

429
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,834
I'd like that.

430
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,235
- Sign him up.
- I'm way ahead of you.

431
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:03,034
- See you around.
- Look forward to it.

432
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,312
Samson, huh?

433
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,191
- Samson.
- Don't cut your hair.

434
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,831
What do you think?

435
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,589
Defensively, we can hold them
to two or three touchdowns.

436
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:23,759
But we need better pass receiving
and more speed to win.

437
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,119
To win?

438
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:34,595
I'm just talking about surviving.
Who's talking about winning?

439
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:40,033
So am I. This isn't just
a football game to the warden.

440
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:43,630
He shows you and this team up,
he's showing up all the prisoners.

441
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,958
It's just a game.

442
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,754
All I want is to survive it.
It's just a game.

443
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:56,988
Not to him it isn't.
It's a fear and violence philosophy:

444
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,873
A chance to be free
for a few hours,

445
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:05,313
to try and be men again,
so he can destroy us.

446
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:09,716
Nate, if you're thinking
about winning the game,

447
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,558
you're as crazy as he is.

448
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,553
Maybe so.

449
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,317
But you spend 14 years in this tank

450
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:24,277
and you realise there's only two things
they can't sweat or beat out of you.

451
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,959
Your balls.

452
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,749
Better hang onto them because they're
all you'll have when you get out.

453
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,031
- Goodnight, Nate.
- Goodnight.

454
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:49,439
<i>Use of toilet facilities is suspended
for two hours until repairs are complete.</i>

455
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,198
<i>Sorry, men.</i>

456
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,596
- Mace.
- Yeah.

457
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,916
Follow my lead.
We're going to do this sucker.

458
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:28,079
Yeah, we got a line-up, we'd jam him.

459
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:31,078
Yeah, let's go
see what this boy wants.

460
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:36,069
Pretty boy, we know what you want.
We don't play no ball.

461
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:41,272
- Figured you did.
- We do but we don't.

462
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:44,119
There it is.

463
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:49,513
- Weren't you two drafted by the pros?
- The pros.

464
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:53,554
I understand that, but we no longer
perform for the honkies' amusement.

465
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,796
Hey, man, I'll play.

466
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:59,117
But guarantee me that I'll start.

467
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:02,633
- You got it.
- All right.

468
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,434
What's wrong with you, nigger?
We don't fuck with them.

469
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,038
- I'm going to play football.
- But not with them honkies.

470
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,711
You better leave. We'll talk later.

471
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:17,989
Yeah, leave. You look better
going than you did coming, anyway.

472
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,395
What's wrong with you?

473
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,556
I'm going to play football.

474
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:25,672
- Look, brother...
- I ain't your goddamn brother.

475
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:30,874
You know what, Granville? You're nothing
but a big old dumb stupid fool.

476
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:35,949
Makes more sense for me to be
busting their heads, than busting yours.

477
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,435
Oh, nigger, please. Shit.

478
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,871
Where are they?

479
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:45,197
They're not due for another
five minutes. What's the matter?

480
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,278
We're in big trouble.

481
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,916
I don't even know if these clowns
played high school football,

482
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:54,111
and we're playing a semi-pro team.

483
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:57,232
Plus, I haven't touched
a ball in seven years.

484
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:01,078
Don't worry.
Once you've got it, you've got it.

485
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:04,511
Throw one at that tyre over there.
It's just like making love.

486
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,790
Once you've done it,
you never forget how.

487
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:15,994
See?

488
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:20,751
All right, men. We're not going to have
time to run any complicated patterns.

489
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:24,073
So we're going to concentrate
on the basic plays.

490
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:30,389
But we might learn a few "specialty
plays", if you know what I mean.

491
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:40,829
Naturally, we're going to try to get
away with as much as possible.

492
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:46,876
My executive assistant, Mr Nate
Scarboro, will be more than happy

493
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:52,919
to show you just exactly how much
you can try to get away with.

494
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:02,033
The one thing that you're going to have
to remember, the most important factor,

495
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:05,198
is to protect your quarterback, me.

496
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:09,751
Wait a minute. That's no bullshit.

497
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:12,269
If anything happens to me,

498
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:18,191
if I get hurt, we're going to have to live
with the fact that we had one chance,

499
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:22,678
one chance in a million,
to humiliate those bastards,

500
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,598
and we blew it.

501
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:29,911
- Is that clear?
- Yeah!

502
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,998
All right.
We're going to hurt them, right?

503
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,713
Right!

504
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:38,959
All right. We're going to kick
the shit out of them, right?

505
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:41,355
- Right!
- What?

506
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:42,879
Right!

507
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:45,036
Right, right, all right!

508
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:48,835
Now, backs and ends come with me,
the rest stay here.

509
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:55,920
OK, linemen. Come on, linemen.
Come on out here.

510
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,999
- What's the agility rating?
- Maximum is 10.

511
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:04,751
All right, just hit the holes, I don't
want to hear you hit any rubber.

512
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,837
Knees high!

513
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:10,953
Come on, let's go, let's go...
That's a two.

514
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:13,720
Let's go! Very good! Knees high!

515
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:18,118
Seven.
Let's go! Hubba, hubba! Knees high!

516
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:21,312
OK, let's move over
to the blocking dummies.

517
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:25,195
Come on, Sonny. Sonny, over here.

518
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:27,913
All right, Granny.

519
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:36,032
- What do I give Granny?
- Six.

520
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:41,954
Seven.

521
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:51,395
- Would that be a ten?
- That's a ten.

522
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:54,831
All right. I want
to see you really hit.

523
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,793
On three. Hut one.

524
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,355
Hut two. Hut three!

525
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:11,911
All right.
Let's protect the passer this time.

526
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,474
Good idea!

527
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,952
Set!

528
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:23,958
Hut one. Hut two. Hut three!

529
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:33,433
- Sorry, man.
- Nice tackle.

530
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,437
Hey, Coach.

531
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:40,200
Where are all those
specialists you promised me?

532
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,236
Jesus Christ!

533
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,468
There he is, Connie Shokner.

534
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:51,075
The very baddest cat in the joint.

535
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,475
Even the guards are terrified of him.

536
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:58,708
He killed five people on the outside
and two in here, with his bare hands.

537
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,433
That karate's bad.

538
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:04,349
- That's before he learned karate.
- Oh.

539
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:12,878
What's he doing now?

540
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:15,548
Nobody's ever had the guts to ask him.

541
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:18,399
Paul. Paul.

542
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:22,589
- I smell a rat.
- Hello, Unger.

543
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,673
Paul.

544
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,950
I've got something
important to ask you.

545
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,432
I want to be manager.

546
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:34,156
- Caretaker's manager.
- I'm better than him. Let me prove it.

547
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:37,477
- Beat it, Unger.
- Fuck off!

548
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:42,952
Paul, why don't you like me?

549
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:45,833
I'm crazy about you.
I think you're terrific.

550
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:52,353
Friendship is something that
should never be taken lightly, Paul.

551
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:59,029
I really want people to like me,
but they never do.

552
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:08,154
I'd like very much
to be your friend, Paul.

553
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:15,552
Well, it would be an honour
and a privilege, Unger.

554
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:18,752
Now, if you'll just excuse me.

555
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,234
Paul.

556
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:26,510
You sure about that?
I can't be manager?

557
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:29,109
Caretaker's manager.

558
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:33,393
If I'd have only found you sooner,
you know?

559
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:38,238
Good thing he loves you. He burnt
to death five people he didn't like.

560
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:40,158
Putty in my hands.

561
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:46,315
Come out, boy. Come out.

562
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:58,954
Hello, Mister Shokner.

563
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:06,074
- Know how to play football?
- Yeah.

564
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,039
Good. Would you like to play football
with us inmates?

565
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:14,188
- No.
- Oh.

566
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:18,832
We're playing the guards.

567
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,752
Yeah. I want to play.

568
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:28,557
He wants to play.

569
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:30,796
Thank you, Mister Shokner.

570
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:35,388
Now, remember,
nobody hits the quarterback.

571
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:37,477
Blue 28!

572
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:41,230
Set! Hut!

573
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:54,513
He broke my fucking nose!

574
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:57,793
You bastard,
you broke my fucking nose!

575
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,592
Calm down. I'll fix it.

576
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,475
I don't want to play this game.

577
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:07,719
- He broke my nose.
- I'm going to fix it, OK? Here we go.

578
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:21,193
- How does it look?
- It looks 100% better, doesn't it?

579
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:23,789
- 100%.
- It does?

580
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,433
Yeah.

581
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:32,680
- He did that on purpose.
- No, he didn't.

582
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:36,836
- Yes, he did.
- Tell him you...

583
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,356
Tell him you're sorry.

584
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:42,834
Please.

585
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:49,876
OK. I'm sorry.

586
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:52,719
OK, everybody.
Huddle up, let's go.

587
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:55,514
He said sorry.

588
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:57,995
- Bullshit!
- He said he was sorry.

589
00:52:58,200 --> 00:52:59,599
You dumb pussy!

590
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:06,791
- Try it again.
- Three, twenty-five, hut, hut!

591
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:16,078
All right.
What about the rest of the team?

592
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:19,956
Outside of Crewe, the only one
who looks like anything is Granville.

593
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:23,436
- Granville could give you real trouble.
- All right, that's all.

594
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:43,438
- Well?
- It's going to be a turkey shoot.

595
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:46,074
He's right, sir.
We're going to destroy 'em.

596
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:48,396
It's a cinch, boss. A cinch.

597
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:50,594
Cinch.

598
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,074
Destroy 'em.

599
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:56,155
Too cute.

600
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:04,269
That's what you said last year before
we lost to Endicott Steel, remember?

601
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:10,517
There's no sense us taking any chances,
letting ourselves get hurt.

602
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:14,349
- So see what we can do about Granville.
- Yes, sir.

603
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,950
Granville, get your ass over here.

604
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:26,878
Yes, sir, Lieutenant.

605
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:32,074
What the hell
you think you're doing, boy?

606
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:34,032
You pick that up.

607
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:42,672
Yes, sir.

608
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:46,509
What is your problem, fat man?

609
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:49,712
Know why you spades always
calling each other "brother"?

610
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:51,594
No, sir.

611
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:55,873
'Cause half of you don't know who your
daddy is, so you might be brothers.

612
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:07,793
Yes, sir, Lieutenant.

613
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:11,193
- You think that's funny?
- Yes, sir.

614
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:13,118
You want to hit me, don't you?

615
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:15,552
No, sir, Lieutenant.

616
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:22,279
You're too ignorant to know when a man's
calling you a stupid, uneducated nigger.

617
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:32,231
Yes, sir, Lieutenant.
May I go now, sir?

618
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:35,193
Yeah, get out of my sight.

619
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:54,195
Blue 48!

620
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:57,311
Blue 48!

621
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:01,840
Set!
Hut one!

622
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:10,077
Shit.

623
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:15,518
Hey, lightweight.

624
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:18,759
What the hell is this?

625
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,359
Here come the rain-clouds.

626
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,638
What do they want?

627
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:28,875
Granny tells us you need a little help.
Says you can guarantee no work detail.

628
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:35,950
- Yeah.
- Guarantee special food like Granny gets?

629
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:37,594
Yeah.

630
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:40,155
We get to hit those guards
like Granny said?

631
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:43,870
You get to hit 'em.

632
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,718
What else can we offer them?

633
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:51,309
...having a Geneva conference
about playing with us.

634
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:54,111
What is this bullshit?

635
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,274
Well, Mister Crewe.

636
00:56:58,360 --> 00:56:59,839
We've come to terms.

637
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:02,789
Compliments from
the Greater Chicago Youth Authority.

638
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,718
There goes the neighbourhood.

639
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:28,911
You wanted to see me?

640
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:30,792
Yes, sir.

641
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:36,640
...especially Unger.

642
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:38,398
- Unger?
- Yes.

643
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:42,673
Unger has a direct pipeline
to Captain Knauer.

644
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:46,759
It's impossible for me to have
a secret practice while Unger's around.

645
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:52,271
I'm supposed
to reschedule the yard activities

646
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:56,189
for three uninterrupted hours
of secret practice?

647
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,834
- That right?
- Yes, sir. Right.

648
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:01,076
And you will talk to Captain Knauer?

649
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:05,512
- I'll speak to the captain on matters.
- Thank you, sir.

650
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:08,319
Mister Crewe.

651
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:11,239
Just what is it you
have up your sleeve?

652
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:15,196
I'm just trying to give you
a football team, Warden.

653
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:21,316
And along the way, maybe give the men
some pride and some dignity.

654
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:23,988
Of course, only for a little while.

655
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:31,036
I know you've got something more
bouncing around inside that head of yours.

656
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,309
You want a game, right?

657
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:40,110
My men don't have a chance in hell
of winning that game.

658
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:44,836
You know it, I know it,
I just don't want them to know it.

659
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:46,959
OK?

660
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:56,554
Man! I ain't had steak
like this in five years!

661
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:58,838
I ain't eaten inside in six!

662
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,594
What have you done for me lately?

663
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:09,588
Today may be the high point
of a long and colourful career.

664
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:13,031
Three, count 'em,
three gigantic rip-offs.

665
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:17,233
First, I've got a box of brand new
equipment waiting to be stashed.

666
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,954
- Compliments of Captain Knauer?
- No less.

667
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,435
<i>And the piece de resistance:</i>

668
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:27,555
How would you like actual game films
of the guardsmen in action?

669
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:31,116
- Can you do that?
- Warden's own home movies.

670
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:33,356
Caretaker, you never cease
to amaze me.

671
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:37,196
Never. But you said
three gigantic rip-offs.

672
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:38,913
That's only two.

673
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:41,998
- You don't want to ruin the surprise.
- Surprise?

674
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:43,872
- There's one thing.
- What?

675
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:49,277
You're going to have to perform
a personal service.

676
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:55,917
What kind of personal service?

677
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,549
The warden's expecting you.
Won't you come this way.

678
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:10,910
- Thank you, Captain.
- Thank you.

679
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:23,155
I'm glad you're not in the swamp
anymore. That can ruin a man.

680
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:24,839
Sure can.

681
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:29,670
We don't have a great deal of time.
We have 15 minutes.

682
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:35,431
- The game films.
- Thank you. That's terrific.

683
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:42,955
Like I said, we only have 15 minutes.

684
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:05,910
Uh-uh. Won't go over the cuffs.

685
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:14,559
You do this very often?

686
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:17,513
I'm as far from Tallahassee
as you are, honey.

687
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:27,674
Shokner.

688
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:31,551
- Shokner.
- Yep.

689
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:35,593
Hit him high like that,
he'll break your back.

690
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:40,149
Breaks your back, he's going
to break the Superstar's back.

691
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:45,516
Don't worry about him. I'll get
that son of a bitch with an empi.

692
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:47,273
Kiai!

693
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:49,710
- Ready! Set!
- Kiai!

694
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:52,595
- Ready! Set!
- Kiai!

695
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:54,434
Take this bandage,

696
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,036
dip it into the plaster of Paris,

697
01:01:57,240 --> 01:02:01,836
wrap it around the cast,
and in 15 minutes it's hard as rock.

698
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:04,110
- Got it?
- Got it.

699
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:08,359
- This is a picture of Walking Boss.
- Yeah!

700
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:11,916
He once broke his right thigh-bone,
maybe you can clip it.

701
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:13,917
- We'll break it again!
- Got it?

702
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:17,396
- Got it!
- All right. We can do it!

703
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:20,194
Gentlemen, what we have here,
in common parlance,

704
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:23,756
is known as a set of brass knuckles.

705
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:26,315
...temporary disabilities.

706
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:29,592
Balls. Gut. Ribs.

707
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:31,631
- You got it?
- Got it!

708
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:34,274
...the ball is snapped,
you go into your opponent,

709
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:39,315
blocking him with your left arm
and bring this hand up into his chin,

710
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:44,071
and I'll guarantee he'll be incapacitated
for the next several moments.

711
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:46,589
- Got it?
- Got it!

712
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:49,712
All right. Here's the play
we're going to use.

713
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:51,956
I don't think the guards
know this formation.

714
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:56,429
It's called "Incidental punishment
after the ball is blown dead".

715
01:02:56,640 --> 01:03:02,875
Any man you tackle gets an extra elbow,
knee, or kick in the mouth. Got it?

716
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:04,354
Got it!

717
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:12,751
I am, without a doubt,

718
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:17,750
the finest maker of raisin jack
in the entire joint.

719
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:22,158
I'm going to call this batch
"Old Caretaker".

720
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:24,555
Do you always keep it in there?

721
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:28,639
Well, it seems like a logical place.

722
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:35,916
- Listen...
- It does get to you.

723
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:39,271
...you and me are buddies, ain't we?
I got you laid.

724
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:46,155
I got you the game film. I got you all
them monsters. I'm getting you drunk.

725
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:49,156
Yes, you are.

726
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:53,557
- There's one thing still bothers me.
- What's that?

727
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:56,153
Why'd you shave them points?

728
01:03:58,280 --> 01:04:01,556
I told you, for the money.

729
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:06,759
No, no. Come on.
Give me the real reason.

730
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:10,754
You really want to know, huh?

731
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:14,795
I never gave a shit about football,

732
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,639
or anything else.

733
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:22,231
The only thing
I ever cared about's my old man.

734
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:28,157
My old man was blind,
never saw me play.

735
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:34,952
Shit, I've been a professional
ever since I was 12 years old.

736
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:37,913
Hustling nickels and
dimes playing pool.

737
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:44,069
Didn't make enough money
to take care of him.

738
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:50,150
And I figured when I got to pro ball,
I'd make one big killing.

739
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:53,396
One big one.

740
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:57,999
Make enough money to set him up,

741
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:03,553
take care of him the rest of his life.

742
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:05,637
Then the son of a bitch died.

743
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:12,954
Do you buy that?

744
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:17,635
Well, that's good
because it's bullshit.

745
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:26,556
Why do you think I shaved points?

746
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:29,955
For the money.

747
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:37,076
<i>One minute to lock-up. One minute.</i>

748
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:38,998
Know what my problem's
always been?

749
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:41,316
No, what?

750
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:45,308
I've always had my shit together.
Always.

751
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:50,998
My problem has been
that I couldn't lift it.

752
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:57,632
I've got to go home.

753
01:05:57,840 --> 01:06:00,798
Oh, you're going to be a party pooper?

754
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:05,039
It's OK. Some pro quarterbacks
drink all night long.

755
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:07,754
I know.

756
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:09,598
Goodnight.

757
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:15,033
Goodnight, Paul. Here,
don't you want to take one with you?

758
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:17,678
<i>Lock it up!</i>

759
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:21,555
<i>- Lock it up!
- Lock it up now.</i>

760
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:24,399
<i>Lock up. Turn off radios.</i>

761
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:30,557
<i>- Turn off the radio.
- Lock it up!</i>

762
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:38,229
Come on, boy. Move.

763
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:40,112
Want to be tucked in?

764
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:45,869
There's nothing I can do for you,
Crewe got to the warden.

765
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:50,232
Captain, if you put me back in the general
population, one of those guys'll kill me.

766
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:54,194
That's what happens to finks.
You've got Crewe to thank for that.

767
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:56,633
He blew the whistle on you.

768
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:58,997
On you specifically.

769
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:02,600
- You got the problem.
- I can help you!

770
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:07,830
Split right. Full back, dive right.
On one, ready?

771
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:11,271
Go left! Go left! Go round!

772
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:14,718
Twenty-eight.

773
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:18,039
Hut!

774
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:21,830
Way to go, way to go!

775
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:41,599
- Let's go!
- Set!

776
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:43,474
Hut!

777
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:47,872
All right.

778
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:01,837
<i>General call for lock-up.</i>

779
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:08,036
<i>- Let's do it! That's my team!
- All prisoners return to their cells.</i>

780
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:11,312
<i>Shop period 5 will begin in 10 minutes.</i>

781
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:17,516
<i>In ten minutes, we expect all men in
shop period 5 to meet outside cell block...</i>

782
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:26,279
<i>Cell block 3A
will take first call for dinner.</i>

783
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:34,468
<i>Dinner rotation
will start with cell block 3A.</i>

784
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:37,917
We don't know enough
about these guys.

785
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:41,078
Why don't we take another look
at the X-rays?

786
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:44,829
The medical files are on my bed,
get them, will you?

787
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:48,350
- Who do you see playing flanker?
- Miller.

788
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:17,719
Get the goddamn key!

789
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:20,319
Warden! Warden!

790
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:22,198
Bring that key!

791
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:27,951
Come on, get him out of there.

792
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:29,914
Earth to earth,

793
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:32,236
ashes to ashes,

794
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:34,510
dust to dust,

795
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:39,032
we commend the soul
of James "Caretaker" Farrell.

796
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:44,437
And now, the peace of God
which passeth all understanding,

797
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:48,114
shall guard your hearts and souls.

798
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:54,550
Unto our God and Father
be glory for ever and ever.

799
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:56,991
Amen.

800
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:16,473
<i>Good afternoon, fellow inmates,
correctional officers,</i>

801
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:19,069
<i>honoured guests,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

802
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:23,398
<i>This is Matt "Killer"Farrell broadcasting
on the Interstate Correctional Facility,</i>

803
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:27,673
<i>the communication broadcasting
system of your state prison.</i>

804
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:32,677
<i>This is part of Warden Rudolph Hazen's
progressive rehabilitation programme.</i>

805
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:37,557
<i>This is indeed an historic occasion
as we sit here</i>

806
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:40,832
<i>in this marvellous
Edward J. Hazen memorial stadium</i>

807
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:44,876
<i>provided for us by our warden,
Rudolph Hazen.</i>

808
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:49,672
All right. Stand up for the warden.

809
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:02,518
Just so you'll know,

810
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:05,792
we've posted armed guards
all along the wall

811
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,833
and at the public end of the field.

812
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:13,875
So if any of you were thinking
of mingling with the civilians

813
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:17,595
and wandering off with the crowd
at the end of the game,

814
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:24,311
we will shoot you.

815
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:29,193
Have a nice game, boys.

816
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:40,638
See you on the field, Superstar.

817
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:09,154
All right, now it's our turn.

818
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:11,876
Here's a surprise from the Caretaker.

819
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:18,318
Come on. Come on.

820
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:28,118
<i>Born free</i>

821
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:31,915
<i>and life is worth living</i>

822
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:35,237
<i>but only worth living</i>

823
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:37,829
<i>'cause you're</i>

824
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:41,476
<i>born free</i>

825
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:47,275
<i>Thanks to the men of cell block C,
affectionately known as</i>

826
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:50,358
<i>the Citrus State Cheerios.</i>

827
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:52,471
<i>The teams are coming onto the field.</i>

828
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:58,073
<i>First, the Guards' defensive unit, led by
Captains Rassmeusen and Bogdanski.</i>

829
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:05,029
<i>Leading out the offensive unit,
the Guards' coach and captain,</i>

830
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:07,834
<i>Wilhelm Knauer.</i>

831
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:10,475
<i>Let's hear it
for Warden Rudolph Hazen</i>

832
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:14,275
<i>who has sponsored
today's progressive contest.</i>

833
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:16,277
Let's get the ball game going.

834
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:20,553
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the Mean Machine.</i>

835
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:25,989
They stole our new uniforms.

836
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:28,668
They got our uniforms.

837
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:30,791
That's right.

838
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:35,838
<i>...all time great,
quarterback for the Mean Machine,</i>

839
01:13:36,040 --> 01:13:38,474
<i>Paul "Wrecking" Crewe.</i>

840
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:48,035
<i>The balance of the Mean Machine
with coach, Nate Scarboro.</i>

841
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:55,359
<i>Please stand and join Mike Syke
in the singing of our national anthem.</i>

842
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:11,837
What are you dressed up for,
Hallowe'en?

843
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:16,192
I figured if you get far enough ahead, you'd
let this middle-aged kid have some fun.

844
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:18,755
Bullshit!

845
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:20,359
- Call it.
- Heads.

846
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:23,836
It is a head.
You've won the toss and may elect to...

847
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:25,917
How did you steal our uniforms?

848
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:27,874
Cute, aren't they?

849
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:29,832
Have a good clean game.

850
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:31,598
So no matter what,

851
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:34,629
just keep sticking it to them.

852
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:37,957
- Now, who are we?
- The Mean Machine.

853
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:39,957
The Mean Machine.

854
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:41,878
Mean Machine.

855
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:43,559
Mean Machine.

856
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:47,116
Mean Machine.

857
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:52,512
Hit that dirt!

858
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,513
One, two, one, two.

859
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:20,998
<i>- Ready, go!
- Hold them out and don't let 'em score</i>

860
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:24,836
<i>Check them out
Hold them out and don't let 'em score</i>

861
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:26,553
<i>Check them out
Hold them out</i>

862
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:29,274
<i>and don't let 'em score</i>

863
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:31,232
Three. Twenty-five.

864
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:33,358
Hut! Hut!

865
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:38,792
<i>Kick was blocked by Granville.</i>

866
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:45,513
<i>The score now is Guardsmen 6,
Mean Machine 0.</i>

867
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:47,753
<i>Guardsmen kick off.</i>

868
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:50,030
Good defence. Way to go.

869
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:53,838
Here! Here!

870
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:56,873
<i>At the fourth down and a prize attack.</i>

871
01:15:57,480 --> 01:15:59,789
<i>Mean Machine serpentines
up to the line of scrimmage.</i>

872
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,355
<i>Scrimmage is first and ten.</i>

873
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:04,797
Tighten the line. Move it.

874
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:09,919
All right, here come the bad guys.
Pick 'em up.

875
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:13,796
Set!
Hut!

876
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:21,234
<i>...in the end zone for two points
and a slashing tackle by number 61.</i>

877
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:25,554
- Bogdanski?
- Bogdanski.

878
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:27,398
Who's supposed to stop him?

879
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:29,591
- I am.
- Right.

880
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:31,756
<i>...goes out there in front of him.</i>

881
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:34,872
<i>A free kick. Charlie Blue Eyes kicks.</i>

882
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:39,676
<i>Taken at the Guards' 40.</i>

883
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:44,271
<i>And he goes down
for an 18-yard drop back.</i>

884
01:16:57,160 --> 01:17:01,119
<i>He's dropped for a five-yard loss,
by number 66, Wilbur Gillan.</i>

885
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:07,078
<i>...and he's fumbled.</i>

886
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:12,034
<i>A Machine ball on their own 32.</i>

887
01:17:12,240 --> 01:17:14,071
<i>He's making the pass.</i>

888
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:17,352
<i>He's hit by a vicious
diving tackle by Bogdanski.</i>

889
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:28,873
<i>It's going to be a penalty for
Bogdanksi for hitting before the pass.</i>

890
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:34,434
<i>So ladies and gentlemen, that
signals the end of the first quarter.</i>

891
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:40,036
<i>...Mean Machine nothing.</i>

892
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:44,396
<i>Ball goes back to Crewe,
he's waiting to pass...</i>

893
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:55,794
<i>Scores!</i>

894
01:17:56,760 --> 01:17:58,159
Damn!

895
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:11,799
Settle down. Good hands. Here we go.

896
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:16,073
Loose showboat on the centre snap.
We're going to fake it. Ready?

897
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:22,388
And the Mean Machine will now line up
for the touchdown attempt.

898
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:35,435
<i>That makes the score eight to seven
in favour of the Guardsmen.</i>

899
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,719
Listen, guys. If they fake
the Walking Boss, cover me.

900
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:45,791
- I gotta get that bastard.
- Bury that son of a bitch.

901
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:51,080
<i>First and ten on their own 31.</i>

902
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:56,115
<i>Wilhelm Knauer. He's dropped
for a two-yard loss on the 29-yard line.</i>

903
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:01,115
Give me the brass knuckles.

904
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:16,518
Take a good whiff.
Take a good whiff. How many fingers?

905
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:18,756
- Three.
- Great.

906
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:23,830
If that Levitt comes up the middle
again, I'm going to clothesline him.

907
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:25,314
Now's the time.

908
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:30,799
- Four three Mau Mau. Ready?
- Hey, hey, hey.

909
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:39,119
Receiver. Set! Hut!

910
01:19:39,320 --> 01:19:41,276
<i>Ball goes to Knauer...</i>

911
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:48,109
<i>Levitt was clotheslined,
and he is not moving.</i>

912
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:52,272
I think I broke his fucking neck.

913
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:03,232
I think he broke his fucking neck.

914
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:06,000
I told you I broke his fucking neck.

915
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:10,511
I think he broke his fucking neck.

916
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:14,156
Sonny, if Knauer drops back
to punt, nail him.

917
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:16,796
You bet your ass. I'll get him.

918
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,558
We need the ball.

919
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:24,313
<i>A little bit of safety here.
A timid or chicken kind of football.</i>

920
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:28,911
<i>Ball goes to Knauer
and he's smashed down.</i>

921
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:36,433
Give me a break, OK?

922
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:41,191
Did you see that? Are you blind?
You're supposed to be impartial.

923
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:45,029
Shit! Might as well be
a goddamn try-out for you.

924
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:51,753
Third and long.
He likes to throw on the flat.

925
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:35,833
<i>And the half ends with the score:
Guardsmen 15, Mean Machine 13.</i>

926
01:21:36,040 --> 01:21:38,395
<i>We'll have the half-time statistics
for you in a few moments,</i>

927
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:43,674
but right now it's time
for our gala half-time activities.

928
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:47,393
- Any suggestions, sir?
- Give your team a pep talk!

929
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:49,750
Yes, sir.

930
01:21:49,960 --> 01:21:53,396
<i>You've got to be a football hero</i>

931
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:56,797
<i>To get along with a beautiful girl</i>

932
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:00,834
<i>You gotta be a touchdown getter
you bet</i>

933
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:03,793
<i>If you want to get a baby to pet</i>

934
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:08,596
Hey, Crewe!
What kind of football you call that?

935
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:10,358
Same kind you're playing.

936
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:14,269
We've let you mothers slide,
now we're going to hang you out to dry.

937
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:16,596
Hey, Wilhelm. Hang loose.

938
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:23,353
Those bastards were good.

939
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:25,755
- Come on, damn it.
- Let's go.

940
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:37,995
Call yourselves a football team?
Bunch of candy-asses.

941
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:40,555
They're laughing at you next door.
Listen.

942
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:47,156
What about Mawabe!
He's a bigshot, man...

943
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:04,669
Just what the hell
do you think you're doing?

944
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:07,155
You wanted a game, you got one.

945
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:08,793
I never mentioned winning.

946
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:11,271
You never said
anything about losing, either.

947
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:15,633
I'll spell it out.

948
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:18,633
We've got Unger in custody.

949
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:22,150
- He's confessed to killing Caretaker.
- What?

950
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:24,510
He said you knew all about it.

951
01:23:24,720 --> 01:23:26,870
But you didn't notify Captain Knauer.

952
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:30,789
And that makes you an accessory.

953
01:23:32,160 --> 01:23:37,029
- You're full of crap.
- You sent Caretaker to that cell.

954
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:39,955
You are an accessory to murder.

955
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:44,395
You could be looking at twenty years,
and counting.

956
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:47,353
Bullshit! There's no way
that would stick in court.

957
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:53,715
No? Mister Crewe, you could be in this
institution until you're old and grey,

958
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:58,391
or until you're dead, whichever's
first, I can promise you that.

959
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:04,516
You're going to lose the game.
And I want a 21-point spread.

960
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:08,399
I can't do that.

961
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:13,679
Of course you can.

962
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:16,476
You've done it before.

963
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:23,711
If I give you the 21 points,

964
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:27,916
will you call off the dogs?

965
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:33,749
The dogs?

966
01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:38,795
If you've got the game in the bag,
you tell your guys to coast.

967
01:24:40,520 --> 01:24:43,876
I don't want any of my men hurt.

968
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:50,675
You have my word.

969
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:53,269
Once we get the 21 points.

970
01:24:57,200 --> 01:25:00,192
You know, there's only one thing
I'm sorry about.

971
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:01,674
What's that?

972
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:04,269
That you're not playing,
knocking heads.

973
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,958
I'm afraid I'm a little
too old for that.

974
01:25:10,160 --> 01:25:13,755
No. You never had the guts
to begin with.

975
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:25,193
You're playing like a bunch of girls.
Every one of you. Candy-asses.

976
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:29,229
You know who's beating you out there?

977
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:32,113
Scum's beating you out there. Scum.

978
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:34,914
And that's the lowest
part of the world.

979
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:38,032
Those are the criminals
and rapists. The murderers.

980
01:25:38,240 --> 01:25:39,912
You're supposed
to represent law and order.

981
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:43,678
- You're supposed to...
- Listen to this shit.

982
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:45,393
He thinks he's Rockne.

983
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:47,238
You're letting the flag down.

984
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:51,319
Go out there and do something about it.
Offence and defence play together.

985
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:54,432
Let's go now. Come on!

986
01:26:11,080 --> 01:26:14,516
- You're guaranteed a 21-point spread.
- What?

987
01:26:14,720 --> 01:26:17,678
Because of your performance,
I was forced to make a deal.

988
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:20,596
In the second half we can beat them.

989
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:24,429
I don't care what you think.
You'll do as I told you.

990
01:26:24,640 --> 01:26:26,358
Mister Crewe will do the same.

991
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:27,874
Yes, sir.

992
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:33,875
When you and your mental midgets
are 21 points ahead,

993
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:38,392
I want you to inflict as much painful
damage on the prisoners as possible.

994
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:43,437
So you understand,
before this game is over,

995
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:49,158
I want every prisoner in this institution
to know what I mean by power,

996
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:51,590
and who controls it.

997
01:26:53,160 --> 01:26:55,993
Do we understand each other?

998
01:26:56,200 --> 01:26:58,555
Yes, sir.

999
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:05,354
<i>It's 15- 13</i>

1000
01:27:05,560 --> 01:27:11,556
<i>and the second half of a surprisingly
close ball game is about to begin.</i>

1001
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:17,711
<i>...ball goes down
and is taken by number 36.</i>

1002
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:28,193
Set! Hut!

1003
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:31,676
<i>...goes straight back, he's getting good
protection and is looking for the receiver.</i>

1004
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:34,269
Throw the ball, man.
I'm open. Crewe!

1005
01:27:34,920 --> 01:27:36,194
Crewe!

1006
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:40,238
Crewe!

1007
01:27:42,120 --> 01:27:44,111
Crewe! Oh, shit!

1008
01:27:46,680 --> 01:27:50,468
- I own that hamburger. Pass it.
- I was open. Can't you see?

1009
01:27:50,680 --> 01:27:52,113
Enough. I'm calling the plays.

1010
01:27:56,680 --> 01:27:58,193
Hut!

1011
01:28:13,080 --> 01:28:15,435
<i>First and ten for the Guards
in opposition territory.</i>

1012
01:28:15,640 --> 01:28:17,437
All right. No sweat.

1013
01:28:17,640 --> 01:28:19,790
<i>Crewe has been poor
in this last series of plays.</i>

1014
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,991
<i>Something seems
to have happened to him.</i>

1015
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:25,670
<i>That last pass wasjust not
a Paul Crewe pass.</i>

1016
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:28,755
Come on, we'll get it back.

1017
01:28:36,160 --> 01:28:37,673
<i>Touchdown!</i>

1018
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:46,837
Stick it to 'em. He's going to choke.

1019
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:55,238
<i>Paul Crewe looking to pass.
Gets a pass off and it's short.</i>

1020
01:28:55,440 --> 01:28:57,715
<i>It's short and it's picked off
by number 21.</i>

1021
01:29:00,440 --> 01:29:02,158
We got it! We got it!

1022
01:29:02,640 --> 01:29:06,553
<i>It's another touchdown for the Guards,
bringing their score to 28,</i>

1023
01:29:06,760 --> 01:29:08,591
<i>to thirteen for the Mean Machine.</i>

1024
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:12,711
- What's happening?
- I'm having a bad day.

1025
01:29:12,920 --> 01:29:16,276
- Bad day?
- Yes. Have you never had one?

1026
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:18,789
Get off my back.

1027
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:25,392
Set! Hut!

1028
01:29:26,720 --> 01:29:30,952
<i>- Ball snaps back and there's a fumble...
- Fumble, fumble!</i>

1029
01:29:31,160 --> 01:29:34,197
- What is that?
- You call yourself good!

1030
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:37,836
Why did you change uniform?
Bullshit.

1031
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:44,717
Paul Crewe
is taking himself out of the ball game.

1032
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:49,109
<i>Paul Crewe is limping badly.
He's limping off the field.</i>

1033
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:52,153
Pop Steadman's
bringing him to the bench.

1034
01:29:52,360 --> 01:29:55,511
<i>We may have seen
the last of Paul Crewe for today.</i>

1035
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:10,793
Let's get this shoe off
and look at that ankle.

1036
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:14,390
I could give him one of my empis.
I'd knock his head off.

1037
01:30:14,600 --> 01:30:16,318
I could be inside making wallets.

1038
01:30:16,520 --> 01:30:21,310
Doesn't feel broken. Somebody
step on it or did you twist it?

1039
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:24,592
- Twisted it.
- Golden boy? Superstar?

1040
01:30:25,480 --> 01:30:28,790
To think we fought Granny for this crap.

1041
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,309
Really sold us out, didn't you, Crewe?

1042
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:34,273
Anybody can see
he's throwing the game.

1043
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:36,630
<i>Pull 'em down, go, let's go.</i>

1044
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:39,399
Let's go.

1045
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:43,229
<i>...at the line of scrimmage.
Less than an inch for a touchdown.</i>

1046
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:46,477
<i>The ball is going back to Keller...</i>

1047
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:51,558
<i>A touchdown for the Guards,
making the score 35 to 13.</i>

1048
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:57,869
<i>With 5 minutes 58 left in the third
quarter, which has been all Guardsmen,</i>

1049
01:30:58,640 --> 01:31:05,512
<i>the score is 35 for the Guardsmen
and 13 for the Mean Machine.</i>

1050
01:31:06,760 --> 01:31:08,034
No point.

1051
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:10,596
<i>With 5.58 left in the third period,</i>

1052
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:15,396
<i>the score remains 35 for the Guardsmen
and 13 for the Mean Machine.</i>

1053
01:31:17,160 --> 01:31:21,836
Kill that Indian mother! Get that
Indian by the boots! Get him over!

1054
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:28,829
Good blocking.
Keep it up. Keep it up.

1055
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:30,314
Come on now.

1056
01:31:31,480 --> 01:31:35,678
<i>Guards'ball, third and two
on their own 37-yard line.</i>

1057
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:40,318
<i>Knauer takes the pass
and throws it to Levitt...</i>

1058
01:31:40,520 --> 01:31:45,594
<i>...Levitt takes the ball and he's going
to the Mean Machine 30-yard line...</i>

1059
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:50,077
...on me.
Jesus Christ! Another injury.

1060
01:31:50,280 --> 01:31:52,555
Come on.

1061
01:31:52,760 --> 01:31:57,959
<i>...number 74, Shop Steward, is badly
hurt, bleeding badly from the mouth.</i>

1062
01:31:58,160 --> 01:32:01,709
<i>...ball goes back to Knauer, who
hands off 11 for another long gain.</i>

1063
01:32:02,640 --> 01:32:04,312
<i>...another injury...</i>

1064
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:10,950
<i>...and it's Sonny Tannen.
He seems to be badly shaken up.</i>

1065
01:32:15,720 --> 01:32:17,870
Crybaby son of a bitch!

1066
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:22,951
Time! Another man down.

1067
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:34,990
Superstar, what kind of deal did you
make this time? What did Hazen promise?

1068
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:40,749
They're killing those guys out there
and you don't even care.

1069
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:51,273
He's right, Crewe.
You fooled the hell out of me.

1070
01:32:51,480 --> 01:32:53,596
I trusted you
and you let me down.

1071
01:32:54,920 --> 01:32:59,755
I know you don't give a shit about nothing,
but I didn't think you'd sell us out.

1072
01:33:00,440 --> 01:33:04,752
Granny,
better get back in there.

1073
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:12,512
Four three inside flank.
Ready? Break.

1074
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:17,670
<i>Ball's on the Mean Machine
48-yard line.</i>

1075
01:33:17,880 --> 01:33:21,156
<i>...ball's gone to Knauer,
he hands off 44...</i>

1076
01:33:22,600 --> 01:33:23,999
<i>...he's picking one up...</i>

1077
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:36,757
- What is it?
- Broken collarbone.

1078
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:38,916
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

1079
01:33:39,120 --> 01:33:44,114
<i>Officials are trying to break up that
fight, getting pretty rough in there.</i>

1080
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:52,709
<i>Granny Granville is hurt. He's holding
his shoulder and appears to be badly hurt.</i>

1081
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:56,674
<i>Probably a broken bone,
but he is on his feet.</i>

1082
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:00,836
Satisfied now?

1083
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:06,234
Jesus, Sonny!

1084
01:34:06,440 --> 01:34:11,275
<i>The officials will assess the penalty.
15 yards for unsporting conduct.</i>

1085
01:34:16,040 --> 01:34:17,837
- Hey, Pop.
- Yeah?

1086
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:22,549
That time you hit Hazen in the mouth,
was it worth it?

1087
01:34:23,480 --> 01:34:27,234
Was it worth 30 years?

1088
01:34:27,440 --> 01:34:29,556
Yeah. For me it was.

1089
01:34:32,720 --> 01:34:35,314
Well, give me my goddamn shoe.

1090
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:42,914
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

1091
01:34:43,120 --> 01:34:48,956
<i>Paul Crewe, number 22, is going back
into the game for the Mean Machine.</i>

1092
01:34:49,160 --> 01:34:54,951
All right. New quarterback. Shok, you're
on the bench. Move over. Here we go.

1093
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:59,349
- Makes no difference where you go.
- Fuck you.

1094
01:34:59,560 --> 01:35:01,790
Look who's back.
It's the baby boy.

1095
01:35:05,320 --> 01:35:09,552
- Set!
- Set, my ass.

1096
01:35:11,400 --> 01:35:12,958
What is he trying to pull?

1097
01:35:13,480 --> 01:35:15,994
- Hut!
- Uh-uh.

1098
01:35:16,200 --> 01:35:19,431
Get that Superstar.

1099
01:35:19,640 --> 01:35:21,915
<i>Behind the line of scrimmage
for a six-yard goal.</i>

1100
01:35:25,160 --> 01:35:30,109
Show 'em who's boss.
Get them. They ain't shit.

1101
01:35:33,280 --> 01:35:34,872
That's how it is?

1102
01:35:35,080 --> 01:35:38,993
<i>They're in a huddle now. There's
the gun ending the third quarter.</i>

1103
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:43,072
That's the quarter.
Let's change ends.

1104
01:35:46,920 --> 01:35:50,071
<i>Ball goes to Crewe. He's going to
pass on fourth and long-yard it.</i>

1105
01:35:50,280 --> 01:35:52,077
<i>...holds the ball
and goes up the middle.</i>

1106
01:35:52,280 --> 01:35:53,554
<i>Crewe goes up the middle...</i>

1107
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:00,752
That's it, Paul.

1108
01:36:04,280 --> 01:36:06,748
<i>- The line is set...
- Hut!</i>

1109
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:11,909
<i>...he's going up the centre.</i>

1110
01:36:15,720 --> 01:36:17,438
Shotgun left. Shotgun.

1111
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:22,356
Hut! Hut!

1112
01:36:23,200 --> 01:36:26,875
<i>Crewe's looking for a receiver.</i>

1113
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:35,754
Where's he going?

1114
01:36:36,240 --> 01:36:39,471
<i>There's a figure that graced
the Polo Grounds for years.</i>

1115
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:43,954
What are you guys so surprised about?

1116
01:36:44,160 --> 01:36:46,594
I'm not letting you have all the fun.

1117
01:36:47,400 --> 01:36:50,233
Bootleg on one.
Ready? Break.

1118
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:54,919
OK. Come on.
Looks good. Keep it alive.

1119
01:36:57,120 --> 01:36:58,599
Set!

1120
01:37:00,920 --> 01:37:02,638
Hut!

1121
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:12,274
<i>There's a first down
on the 20-yard line.</i>

1122
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:16,794
Your confidence back?

1123
01:37:17,720 --> 01:37:20,359
- Get Scarboro.
- Son of a bitch.

1124
01:37:23,480 --> 01:37:27,758
<i>Ball goes back to Crewe,
he's waiting to pass...</i>

1125
01:37:40,040 --> 01:37:44,238
<i>...by Bogdanski. Bogdanski hit
Nate Scarboro a cheap shot.</i>

1126
01:37:44,440 --> 01:37:46,396
<i>A reprehensible action.</i>

1127
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:48,752
Cheap shot!

1128
01:37:51,240 --> 01:37:53,117
Let me at the son of a bitch.

1129
01:37:55,560 --> 01:37:58,870
Old Double O
is down and seems badly hurt.

1130
01:37:59,880 --> 01:38:01,757
How is it, Nate?

1131
01:38:01,960 --> 01:38:06,670
I love it. After all these years,
my first touchdown.

1132
01:38:07,480 --> 01:38:10,119
It's got to be his knee.
I heard it pop.

1133
01:38:11,160 --> 01:38:13,879
- Get him up.
- You'll be OK. Hang in there.

1134
01:38:21,280 --> 01:38:23,555
Hey, Paul. You've got to do it.

1135
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:28,878
- Screw Hazen!
- Don't worry. He'll get his.

1136
01:38:31,080 --> 01:38:32,798
<i>Good old Nate Scarboro.</i>

1137
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,878
One of the most beloved men
this institution has had.

1138
01:38:47,560 --> 01:38:50,632
<i>The extra point kick is good.</i>

1139
01:38:50,840 --> 01:38:53,718
<i>Tightening that score now
to 35 to 20.</i>

1140
01:38:55,160 --> 01:38:59,358
Blue Eyes can kick the ball ten yards,
can someone fall on it?

1141
01:38:59,560 --> 01:39:02,472
- Right on.
- Then let's go!

1142
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:11,152
<i>Charlie Blue Eyes approaches the ball
and kicks...</i>

1143
01:39:11,360 --> 01:39:13,555
<i>It's an on-side kick...</i>

1144
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:22,432
<i>And it's recovered
for the Mean Machine.</i>

1145
01:39:25,400 --> 01:39:28,039
Shut up. Shut up!

1146
01:39:28,240 --> 01:39:30,071
You're stinking the place up.

1147
01:39:30,680 --> 01:39:33,717
- Can we take 'em?
- Yeah!

1148
01:39:38,240 --> 01:39:41,232
Split right. On two. Ready?

1149
01:39:49,640 --> 01:39:51,153
Set!

1150
01:39:52,520 --> 01:39:54,078
Hut!

1151
01:39:54,280 --> 01:39:57,875
<i>Ball goes back to Crewe.
Crewe hands off to number 30...</i>

1152
01:40:05,400 --> 01:40:08,153
<i>...23 yards.
Crewe's down on the ten-yard line.</i>

1153
01:40:08,360 --> 01:40:10,032
A beautiful piece of razzle-dazzle.

1154
01:40:10,760 --> 01:40:16,073
<i>Paul Crewe reached into
his bag of tricks that time, folks.</i>

1155
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:33,797
<i>Charlie Blue Eyes splits the uprights
and that makes it 35 to 27.</i>

1156
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,719
- How we doing?
- Fine.

1157
01:40:36,920 --> 01:40:39,275
There you go, Nate.

1158
01:40:39,480 --> 01:40:42,950
I heard you were on your way in.

1159
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:48,832
Hey, did they tell you
about my touchdown?

1160
01:40:49,040 --> 01:40:53,431
<i>We repeat, with five minutes and
four seconds left in the fourth quarter,</i>

1161
01:40:53,640 --> 01:40:56,074
<i>there is now only
an eight-point difference.</i>

1162
01:41:00,720 --> 01:41:03,837
- Here we go.
- Can you drop-kick from here?

1163
01:41:04,040 --> 01:41:06,110
- I could try.
- Drop-kick?

1164
01:41:07,040 --> 01:41:09,110
It's fourth and four
and we're going to drop-kick.

1165
01:41:09,320 --> 01:41:13,029
Shotgun.
Drop-kick, on one. Ready?

1166
01:41:18,080 --> 01:41:20,435
<i>...he's got to come up
with something different.</i>

1167
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:24,630
<i>Ball goes back to
Charlie Blue Eyes...</i>

1168
01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:31,591
I haven't seen one
of those in years.

1169
01:41:32,480 --> 01:41:35,074
- What was that?
- A drop-kick.

1170
01:41:35,280 --> 01:41:38,511
- How much does that count?
- Three points.

1171
01:41:38,920 --> 01:41:41,957
For that? Bullshit!

1172
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:46,832
<i>The score stands Guards 35,
Mean Machine 30.</i>

1173
01:41:47,040 --> 01:41:50,316
<i>Fourth and 21
for the Mean Machine on their own 39.</i>

1174
01:41:50,520 --> 01:41:53,034
<i>Crewe is feigning...</i>

1175
01:41:53,240 --> 01:41:55,708
<i>...and he dumps off another pass.</i>

1176
01:42:04,880 --> 01:42:07,269
<i>...Bogdanski saves a touchdown.</i>

1177
01:42:07,480 --> 01:42:10,995
Bogdanski is really wreaking havoc
on that Mean Machine team.

1178
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,434
Quiet down.
Now, listen to me.

1179
01:42:17,120 --> 01:42:20,795
We're going to let Bogdanski come right
through. Nobody touch him. Got it?

1180
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:25,676
I want to try something.
If it works, everybody hit him. Right?

1181
01:42:25,880 --> 01:42:30,874
- Right.
- Split right. All curl, on one. Ready?

1182
01:42:31,640 --> 01:42:32,914
Red left!

1183
01:42:33,400 --> 01:42:36,039
Blue 69!

1184
01:42:36,480 --> 01:42:38,596
Blue 69!

1185
01:42:40,200 --> 01:42:41,792
Set!

1186
01:42:45,880 --> 01:42:49,111
<i>...throws the ball
directly at Bogdanski's groin.</i>

1187
01:42:53,080 --> 01:42:55,355
- Get off him.
- That's bullshit!

1188
01:42:57,600 --> 01:43:00,114
<i>They're unravelling the tangle now,</i>

1189
01:43:00,320 --> 01:43:03,676
and there's a penalty against
the Mean Machine for roughness,

1190
01:43:03,880 --> 01:43:09,113
<i>and that pass sure didn't look like
it was an accident.</i>

1191
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:13,878
Bogdanski is staggering,
but he is up and on his feet.

1192
01:43:14,080 --> 01:43:19,552
OK. We've got fifteenth.
Let's huddle up on the ball. Huddle up.

1193
01:43:26,240 --> 01:43:27,514
Unbelievable.

1194
01:43:36,200 --> 01:43:38,031
Hey, Bog.
Get out of here.

1195
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:40,435
- Come on.
- I know what I'm doing.

1196
01:43:40,640 --> 01:43:44,474
- Worked once, got to work again. Right?
- Right.

1197
01:43:44,680 --> 01:43:48,958
All right.
One more time, on two. Ready?

1198
01:43:49,160 --> 01:43:53,119
<i>It's third and 32
for the Mean Machine.</i>

1199
01:43:59,080 --> 01:44:01,469
Set!
Hut!

1200
01:44:01,680 --> 01:44:03,910
<i>Ball goes back to Crewe...</i>

1201
01:44:05,440 --> 01:44:08,034
Crewe hits Bogdanski with the ball
right in the...

1202
01:44:08,240 --> 01:44:10,629
<i>...in the nether regions.</i>

1203
01:44:10,840 --> 01:44:14,469
<i>Once again, Bogdanski is down,
the Mean Machine is dirty.</i>

1204
01:44:29,480 --> 01:44:32,438
- He's not breathing.
- Do something. Try mouth-to-mouth.

1205
01:44:33,040 --> 01:44:36,794
- You want to?
- No way.

1206
01:44:37,360 --> 01:44:38,679
Ambulance. Help!

1207
01:44:40,520 --> 01:44:45,878
<i>They are taking Bogdanski
off the field in an ambulance.</i>

1208
01:45:09,680 --> 01:45:11,875
He pushed him!

1209
01:45:16,360 --> 01:45:19,636
You can't see,
you blind son of a bitch.

1210
01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:24,118
Hey, Walking Boss,
here's your crying towel.

1211
01:45:24,320 --> 01:45:27,198
You big fat-assed son of a bitch.

1212
01:45:27,400 --> 01:45:30,790
Go get off and stay off.

1213
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:32,433
First down.

1214
01:45:33,280 --> 01:45:34,554
Time out.

1215
01:45:34,760 --> 01:45:36,352
Jesus!

1216
01:45:38,720 --> 01:45:41,678
- Scooter, you want to hit somebody?
- Yeah.

1217
01:45:41,880 --> 01:45:44,792
All right. Tackle eligible.

1218
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:46,831
Mawabe, talk to me.

1219
01:45:47,040 --> 01:45:49,508
- What are you doing?
- One step off the line.

1220
01:45:49,720 --> 01:45:51,950
- I'll step on the line.
- Right. On one. Ready?

1221
01:45:52,160 --> 01:45:57,188
Machine's ball, first and ten
on the Guards' 31-yard line.

1222
01:45:57,400 --> 01:45:58,833
Blue 28!

<i>...less than one minute

01:46:11,480 --> 01:46:13,198
Protest that play!

1226
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:24,953
Crewe, call time.

1227
01:46:25,600 --> 01:46:28,876
Time. Time.
Time, ref. Time.

1228
01:46:29,080 --> 01:46:31,878
<i>First and goal on the one-yard line,</i>

1229
01:46:32,080 --> 01:46:34,036
as Crewe calls time out, with...

1230
01:46:34,240 --> 01:46:37,152
<i>...40 seconds left on the clock.</i>

1231
01:46:37,360 --> 01:46:39,828
Mean Machine! Mean Machine!

1232
01:46:40,040 --> 01:46:43,430
Mean Machine! Mean Machine!

1233
01:46:43,640 --> 01:46:45,358
Mean Machine!

1234
01:46:47,800 --> 01:46:50,234
Quiet down. Split right...
Joe Jack!

1235
01:46:50,440 --> 01:46:53,273
Split right, sweep left.
On one. Ready?

1236
01:46:55,200 --> 01:46:58,397
Blue 28! Blue 28!

1237
01:46:58,600 --> 01:47:00,352
Set! Hut!

1238
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:10,034
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
this is really a ball game.</i>

1239
01:47:10,240 --> 01:47:12,276
This is a great ball team.

1240
01:47:12,480 --> 01:47:16,439
<i>They're giving these Guardsmen
the fight of their lives.</i>

1241
01:47:19,800 --> 01:47:23,156
Split right, roll out right,
option pass. Be waiting, Mace.

1242
01:47:23,360 --> 01:47:25,396
On two, on two. Ready?

1243
01:47:25,600 --> 01:47:28,558
<i>- Second and goal.
- Blue 20.</i>

1244
01:47:29,720 --> 01:47:33,429
Blue 20. Set! Hut!

1245
01:47:34,920 --> 01:47:36,399
<i>Crewe feigns the pass...</i>

1246
01:47:37,080 --> 01:47:40,072
<i>...and he throws...</i>

1247
01:47:40,280 --> 01:47:43,909
...stopping the clock again
with 16 seconds left.

1248
01:47:46,840 --> 01:47:49,229
Flip right, dive left, Indian.

1249
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:52,000
Now, if we don't make it,
everybody yell time.

1250
01:47:52,200 --> 01:47:54,031
Everybody yell time.
On one. Ready?

1251
01:47:59,760 --> 01:48:03,719
Blue 29! Blue 29!
Set!

1252
01:48:04,720 --> 01:48:07,154
<i>Ball goes back to Crewe...</i>

1253
01:48:10,040 --> 01:48:13,396
Time! Time!

1254
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:16,479
Crewe calls for his third
and last time out

1255
01:48:16,680 --> 01:48:18,955
<i>with seven seconds left on the clock.</i>

1256
01:48:19,600 --> 01:48:21,670
Mean Machine! Mean Machine!

1257
01:48:23,680 --> 01:48:25,432
Where the hell's he going?

1258
01:48:26,640 --> 01:48:27,959
Let's find out.

1259
01:48:28,840 --> 01:48:33,197
<i>Crewe has taken his last time out
and he's heading toward the bench.</i>

1260
01:48:33,400 --> 01:48:38,315
<i>He's heading toward the bench
followed by his entire offensive unit.</i>

1261
01:48:39,440 --> 01:48:40,759
<i>Most unusual...</i>

1262
01:48:41,800 --> 01:48:45,156
<i>I don't know what they're doing,
it's silent as a church.</i>

1263
01:48:46,080 --> 01:48:49,789
<i>It looks more like a prayer meeting
than a huddle.</i>

1264
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,230
<i>Whatever happens,
regardless of the outcome,</i>

1265
01:48:52,440 --> 01:48:55,477
<i>this has been one fantastic showing.</i>

1266
01:48:55,680 --> 01:48:58,399
We've come too far together
to stop now.

1267
01:48:58,600 --> 01:49:01,797
For Granny, for Nate,

1268
01:49:04,520 --> 01:49:08,274
for Caretaker, let's do it.

1269
01:49:16,080 --> 01:49:18,389
Mean Machine!

1270
01:49:21,240 --> 01:49:22,832
Mean Machine!

1271
01:49:25,680 --> 01:49:28,513
Mean Machine! Mean Machine!

1272
01:49:40,440 --> 01:49:43,318
- Hold it down!
- Cool it!

1273
01:49:44,640 --> 01:49:47,154
Set!

1274
01:49:48,520 --> 01:49:50,431
Hut!

1275
01:51:17,160 --> 01:51:21,551
<i>Thirty-six, thirty-five,
in favour of the Mean Machine.</i>

1276
01:51:29,800 --> 01:51:31,074
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1277
01:51:31,280 --> 01:51:33,350
<i>like the fabled phoenix of old...</i>

1278
01:51:44,840 --> 01:51:47,229
Mean Machine! Mean Machine!

1279
01:51:47,440 --> 01:51:50,830
Mean Machine! Mean Machine!

1280
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:54,555
Mean Machine! Mean Machine!

1281
01:51:54,760 --> 01:51:56,751
Mean Machine! Mean Machine!

1282
01:52:19,920 --> 01:52:26,029
- You know, you guys ain't half bad.
- You're right.

1283
01:52:27,680 --> 01:52:29,113
Fuck you, boy.

1284
01:52:29,680 --> 01:52:32,114
Not today, boss.

1285
01:52:40,040 --> 01:52:42,713
History.

1286
01:52:42,920 --> 01:52:46,993
We stopped 'em. We are number one!

1287
01:52:55,960 --> 01:52:59,111
Where's your goddamn
power theory now?

1288
01:52:59,320 --> 01:53:01,231
He's trying to escape.

1289
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:04,079
- Oh, shit!
- Officer!

1290
01:53:04,280 --> 01:53:06,191
- Crewe!
- I'm talking to you!

1291
01:53:08,800 --> 01:53:10,074
Crewe!

1292
01:53:10,280 --> 01:53:12,589
He's trying to escape. Shoot him!

1293
01:53:13,200 --> 01:53:16,158
- Crewe!
- You going to let him escape? Shoot.

1294
01:53:16,360 --> 01:53:19,033
- Shoot him, you... Shoot him!
- Crewe!

1295
01:53:20,400 --> 01:53:24,473
- Crewe!
- Kill him! Kill that son of a bitch!

1296
01:53:24,680 --> 01:53:26,272
Shoot him!

1297
01:53:45,640 --> 01:53:47,870
Game ball.

1298
01:54:02,200 --> 01:54:04,475
Stick this in your trophy case.

1299
01:54:10,680 --> 01:54:13,194
I knew you could do it!
