1
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:22,708
It's me.

2
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:26,147
Everything all right?

3
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:32,016
What do you mean they're gone?
You mean, she's gone, too?

4
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:37,456
I'll be waiting in front of the hotel.

5
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:45,247
Who could have guessed
a thing like that, sir?

6
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:48,824
When he got down into the street,
it was still dark.

7
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:51,825
Then the front door opened again,
and she came out, too.

8
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:55,059
I thought she must have
come down to say goodbye to him.

9
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:57,068
Instead, she opens the door of the car,

10
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:00,537
makes the dog get in, gets in herself,
and they're off.

11
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,540
Aren't you listening, <i>Dottore?</i>

12
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:04,337
Yes. Yes.

13
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:07,744
Damn it. This is something
we didn't want. Anyway,

14
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:11,613
as far as I'm concerned,
I followed the instructions.

15
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:20,983
You've made up your mind?

16
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,358
What do you think marriage
will get you?

17
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:26,796
I don't know.
The impression of normalcy.

18
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:31,697
- Normalcy.
- Yes. Stability, security.

19
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:35,865
In the morning when I'm dressing
in the mirror I see myself.

20
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:39,035
And compared to everyone else,
I feel I'm different.

21
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:41,477
What do you see in Giulia?

22
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:43,640
It may be her body, her sensuality.

23
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,876
Yes? And she?

24
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:47,851
The minute we're alone
she wants to fool around.

25
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:51,048
- And then?
- It usually ends up rolling on the rug.

26
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:54,183
- And the maid with the big tits?
- Oh, she's part of the dowry.

27
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:57,821
So you're getting married,
and I'm losing my best friend.

28
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:01,197
That's okay.

29
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,788
Two minutes and you're on, <i>signore.</i>

30
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:24,654
You're sure he's arriving?

31
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:27,658
The Colonel? Of course. He'll be here.

32
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,194
He promised. He's very interested.

33
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,300
It's best if you're quiet.
It's funny though, you know?

34
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,265
Everyone would like
to be different from the others,

35
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:39,770
but instead you want to be
the same as everyone else.

36
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,600
Ten years ago,
my father was in Munich.

37
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:47,044
Often, after the theater, he told me that

38
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:50,606
he'd go with friends to a <i>Bierstube.</i>

39
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:54,682
There was a nutty man
they thought a fool.

40
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:57,088
He spoke about politics.

41
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,417
He was quite an attraction.

42
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:05,022
They'd buy him beer
and encourage him.

43
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:09,197
He'd stand up on the table
making furious speeches.

44
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:13,337
It was Hitler.

45
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:17,508
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>that was "Who's Happier Than I"</i>

46
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,737
<i>by Cesare Andrea Bixio.</i>

47
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:22,838
<i>We conclude our program</i>
<i>of popular music</i>

48
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:25,008
<i>with Arcangeli and Orchestra.</i>

49
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:28,849
<i>The singers were Silvana Fioresi,</i>
<i>Oscar Carboni,</i>

50
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:32,015
<i>Lina Termini and "The Swallows."</i>

51
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,061
<i>We bring you now</i>
<i>"Mystique of an Alliance,"</i>

52
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:48,163
<i>a talk by Italo Montanari.</i>

53
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:53,534
<i>Italy and Germany,</i>
<i>two strongholds of light</i>

54
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:55,674
<i>in the course of centuries.</i>

55
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:59,411
Their unparalleled encounters
mark a turning point

56
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:03,054
in the course of world history.

57
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:06,421
Once again,
these two peoples are rediscovering

58
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:08,221
their ancient virtues.

59
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:12,195
Virtues that embody
similarity and reciprocity

60
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:13,765
that have been long forgotten,

61
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:16,892
that which Goebbels calls
"the Prussian aspect"

62
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:18,197
of Benito Mussolini,

63
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:21,705
and which we call
"the Latin aspect" of Adolf Hitler.

64
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:25,904
Italy and Germany, bringing the world
two great revolutions,

65
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:29,140
the Anti-Parliamentarian
and the Anti-Democratic.

66
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:35,182
Please, stay seated, Clerici.

67
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:38,723
Is there any news for me?

68
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:42,352
Your personal record is really excellent.

69
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:44,527
Then I'm hired?

70
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,064
Such decisions must be taken slowly.

71
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:50,226
- Yes, I understand.
- Yes, of course you would.

72
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:54,067
Civil servant, Baccalaureate in Classics,
good future career,

73
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:56,937
and Comrade Montanari
has recommended you.

74
00:07:57,643 --> 00:08:00,237
One morning you come to the ministry.

75
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:04,112
You arrive at my office at the ministry
with your bright and shining face,

76
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:05,912
you make a specific proposal.

77
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:12,349
The office of the Minister!

78
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:19,864
<i>Did you ever ask yourself why</i>
<i>people want to collaborate with us?</i>

79
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,500
Some do it out of fear,

80
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,698
most of them for the money.

81
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:29,106
For faith in Fascism, very few.

82
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,698
But you, no.

83
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:34,371
I feel that you're not governed
by any of these reasons.

84
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:36,810
And when may I expect a reply?

85
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:39,175
I hope very soon.

86
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:43,278
If I put aside the idealist revolutionary...

87
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:46,547
I must ask myself what your aim is.

88
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:52,764
I stand prepared to go,
as soon as you decide.

89
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:55,325
Fine.

90
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,531
I'll introduce you to the Minister.

91
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,190
Clerici! Clerici!

92
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:58,255
- At your service.
- The Minister is expecting us.

93
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:00,832
Is this the first time
you're seeing the Minister?

94
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,127
Yes.

95
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:05,692
When I explained your plan to him,
the first thing he said was, "Superb.

96
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:09,036
"Get to Professor Quadri
and you inspire his faith in you.

97
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:11,974
"You try to discover
who his contacts in Italy are."

98
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:13,545
Yes, yes, superb!

99
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:15,477
And even more important, spontaneous!

100
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:18,641
- And also, voluntary.
- Voluntary agency.

101
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,844
For repressing Anti-Fascism.

102
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:24,149
<i>You've got to try</i>
<i>and understand women.</i>

103
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:29,086
Say she had decided to stay in Paris.
She could have, no?

104
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:34,832
<i>"Animula vagula blandula</i>

105
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:37,198
<i>"hospes comesque corporis."</i>

106
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:41,766
I'm sorry, I didn't get that.

107
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:43,899
It's nothing. It's Latin.

108
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,945
<i>Five seconds, four seconds,</i>

109
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:50,573
<i>three seconds, two seconds,</i>
<i>one second.</i>

110
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:55,409
<i>The correct time</i>
<i>at the signal was 1:00 p.m.</i>

111
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,093
Here.

112
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:11,704
Pretty.

113
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:12,068
Pretty.

114
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:17,674
Aren't you giving them to me?

115
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:20,610
Today I absolutely need your flowers.

116
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:23,739
Give them here. For you.

117
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:30,820
You know what I was thinking?
I really must go to a fortune teller.

118
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:33,414
I want to know everything about you.

119
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,189
Don't stand around looking.

120
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,664
Darling!

121
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,154
Careful!

122
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:13,165
But, Marcello, we're engaged,
what's wrong with it?

123
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:15,927
My uncle brought something
from America.

124
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,335
What is it?

125
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:48,224
Mama made out a list of invitations.

126
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:50,700
- Want to see it?
- No, I trust her.

127
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:53,496
I was talking to Don Lattanzi.

128
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,631
If you want to marry,
you go to communion,

129
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:57,504
you've got to confess.

130
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,238
Otherwise he says he cannot marry us.

131
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,838
I don't believe in it.

132
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,473
Who does?

133
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:08,451
Ninety percent of the people
who go to church today don't believe.

134
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:10,545
The priests don't either.

135
00:13:10,656 --> 00:13:13,716
All right, if you want me to,
I'll even confess.

136
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:16,919
I love you.

137
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:21,062
If you want to...

138
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:26,899
- If I want to...
- Yes, right here.

139
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:31,706
On the floor, on the carpet. Want to?

140
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:36,808
Better think about the priest.

141
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:40,710
He may not grant absolution.

142
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,284
They grant everyone absolution.

143
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:48,585
After all, it will be so soon,
our honeymoon.

144
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:54,191
Have you decided yet, where?

145
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:55,924
Yes.

146
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,272
But I can't tell you anything yet.

147
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:06,267
It's a surprise.

148
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:08,972
- A surprise?
- A surprise?

149
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:12,547
Yes, yes, I adore surprises.

150
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:17,286
Giulia, leave us alone.

151
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:24,257
- Marcello, I went down for the mail...
- Come and eat!

152
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:34,538
The letter's anonymous?

153
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:37,064
What is it all about?

154
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:39,974
But you know
they're just awful to do this.

155
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,842
Worse than stabbing us in the back.

156
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:43,278
But what's in the letter?

157
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:46,078
And the stamp shows
it's someone in Rome.

158
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:49,643
Let me see, Mama.
I want to see what's written there.

159
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:52,553
Read it just for us. But then I'll burn it.

160
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:55,659
There are such ugly things in it.

161
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:59,857
<i>"Signora,</i> in permitting your
daughter and her fiancé to marry,

00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:01,694
"you're committing more than an error,

00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,132
"you're committing a crime."

- Ridiculous.
- No. I don't mind a bit.

are obligatory, a friend told me.

you're an angel!

00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,168
Thank you.

175
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:41,563
You see, the origin of my father's
mental illness isn't venereal.

176
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:43,073
That can be medically confirmed.

177
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:45,234
By the way,
my little girl has had the mumps,

178
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:47,574
scarlet fever, and German measles.

179
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,615
- They're all very moral maladies.
- Yes!

180
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:38,997
Look here, who are you?
Why are you following me?

181
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:40,759
Pure coincidence.

182
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:43,899
I wasn't following you.

183
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:47,628
Evidently, we're both going
to the same place.

184
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,378
I'd like to ask you something.
Would your name be Clerici?

185
00:16:57,483 --> 00:16:59,713
Yes, I'm <i>Dottore</i> Clerici.
And who are you?

186
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:03,481
I'm Special Agent Manganiello.
Sent by the Colonel.

187
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:04,817
Get in.

188
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:07,286
- Thanks.
- Hemlock!

189
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:13,121
Such disorder.
The place looks like a dung heap.

190
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:15,825
Yes, it's a pity.

191
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:18,496
Hemlock!

192
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:31,775
Speed up, Manganiello,
or we won't catch up with them.

193
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:35,342
I can't go faster than this, sir.
The road is slippery.

194
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:38,886
Not more than half an hour ahead.

195
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:40,982
Don't talk so much. Hurry!

196
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:46,825
It's slippery.

197
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:50,095
I know. But we must save her,
no matter how slippery.

198
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:51,362
I understand you.

199
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:56,703
But if we break our necks,
where will that get us? <i>Dottore?</i>

200
00:17:57,309 --> 00:18:00,608
The Colonel told me
that I have to tell you...

201
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:02,646
After. Wait here.

202
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:07,548
Mother. Please cover yourself.

203
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,846
I don't want to see you half nude.

204
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:14,016
What a son I have.
A moralist, my son is now.

205
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,158
You know? I had a dream just now.

206
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:21,289
You came in here by that door,
you sat where you are.

207
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,265
You kissed me actually.

208
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:30,904
Why aren't you dressed?

209
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:32,203
What's the time?

210
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:34,745
It's late. We're gonna visit Papa.

211
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:43,048
Why doesn't he die?

212
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:48,859
All that hospital money we'd save,
and I've got so little.

213
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:52,397
- We'll sell the auto.
- No. I'm not going to sell that.

214
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:55,896
If I do, it means discharging Hemlock

215
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:58,532
and I must have him near me.

216
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,969
I get so lonely in this house.

217
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:03,371
I want to see him when I please.

218
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:07,307
Please don't talk to me
about your lovers.

219
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:10,279
What do you mean? There's only one.

220
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:14,076
And he's much more elegant
than your silly fiancée is.

221
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:21,159
What a bastard you are!

222
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:26,193
No, I'm not selling the car.

223
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:28,331
I will sell the house.

224
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:30,401
I want to travel around Europe.

225
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,663
After all, I was born to travel.

226
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:34,636
And Rome has become so provincial.

227
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,231
Middle-class children marrying
into all kinds of good families.

228
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,640
It's all a lot of horse manure!

229
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:49,548
- Special Agent Manganiello!
- Present!

230
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:54,650
Does this house look normal to you?
A place for normal people?

231
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,785
The Colonel told me
that I have to tell you...

232
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:58,795
For a normal childhood?

233
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:01,365
The decadence here
makes me nauseous.

234
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:02,899
- Manganiello.
- Yes, <i>Dottore?</i>

235
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:04,468
Comrade.

236
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:07,096
Do you see this?

237
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:09,797
It's morphine.

238
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:13,802
What did the Colonel say?

239
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:16,176
There's a small change in the program.

240
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:19,182
On your way to Paris
before you cross the frontier,

241
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:23,277
you must stop at Ventimiglia,
Via dei Glicini, number three.

242
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,583
Number three Via dei Glicini.

243
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:29,656
You'll meet a trusted person
called Raoul.

244
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:32,260
He'll give you further instructions.

245
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:34,889
How long have you been in the ranks?

246
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:38,027
I began in 1923.

247
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:40,263
Turkey, France, Greece.

248
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:42,567
- Always into the breach?
- I'm on the move.

249
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:44,198
All for family and my country.

250
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:46,539
Your country before the family.

251
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:48,909
Yes, sir. Of course.

252
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:50,481
Comrade!

253
00:20:57,623 --> 00:21:01,423
Manganiello, you see that individual?

254
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:04,252
His name is Ki.

255
00:21:04,963 --> 00:21:06,692
- Ki?
- That's right.

256
00:21:06,898 --> 00:21:09,162
"Ki" means Hemlock in Japanese.

257
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,970
Being called Hemlock isn't normal.

258
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:15,797
He's a procurer.

259
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:21,474
He couldn't be my brother,
but my mother could be his mother.

260
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,939
I said it doesn't seem normal.

261
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:28,882
He brings her morphine
and uses her as he likes.

262
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:30,711
- Hemlock?
- Yes.

263
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:35,622
You must understand why I tell you this.

264
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:42,964
Five minutes and he won't have
the time to take a valise.

265
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:58,012
Tell the Colonel to count on me!

266
00:22:00,118 --> 00:22:03,554
Hemlock! Hemlock!

267
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:06,351
- Hemlock!
- Where is he hiding?

268
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:08,389
You weren't rude to him again,
were you?

269
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,427
I? No, he's so charming.

270
00:22:13,298 --> 00:22:14,492
Hemlock!

271
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:17,899
Hemlock!

272
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:29,076
Have you looked in his room?

273
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:32,116
I've looked everywhere.
Even under your bed.

274
00:22:57,476 --> 00:22:59,774
- How are things, Franz?
- Better than yesterday.

275
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:02,176
- Yesterday, we were bad.
- Pretty bad?

276
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,111
Yesterday we were forced
to wear our straitjacket.

277
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,547
- And today?
- Today is better.

278
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:07,777
The wind seems to help our inspiration.

279
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:10,218
I'll never be tired of repeating.

280
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:12,017
If the State doesn't model itself

281
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:15,218
on the image of the individual,
how will the individual

282
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:18,455
ever model himself
in the image of the state?

283
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:20,588
Et cetera, et cetera.

284
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:24,266
Slaughter and melancholy.

285
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:27,233
Slaughter and melancholy.

286
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:30,137
Antonio, your son's
decided to get married.

287
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,436
Marcello getting married?

288
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:42,450
Slaughter and melancholy.

289
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:44,680
Look.

290
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:47,925
The announcement of the wedding.

291
00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:50,517
Stop it. He's your father!

292
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:55,500
I like it. Sign it.

293
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:08,001
Read. He's not as crazy as he looks.

294
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,812
May I ask a moment alone
with my father?

295
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:16,113
When I was just a boy,

296
00:24:16,254 --> 00:24:18,188
you used to tell me
about your punitive forays.

297
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,258
I don't know, I can't recall anything.

298
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:23,418
But why are you ashamed?
It's important for me.

299
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:28,623
When you were healthy,
you used a big cudgel.

300
00:24:28,733 --> 00:24:29,791
Yes.

301
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:32,699
- And did you give castor oil to them?
- Yes.

302
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:34,733
- And didn't you torture them?
- Yes.

303
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,308
Didn't you kill? You killed, too?

304
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:40,071
Go away! Franz! Franz!

305
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:59,487
Do you believe at all in fate, <i>Dottore?</i>

306
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:04,364
Well, two years ago in Africa,
after a mission like this,

307
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:08,496
they tell me at Headquarters,
"Did you receive the counter-orders?"

308
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:10,700
"Hey, what counter-orders?"

309
00:25:11,209 --> 00:25:13,109
Well, in Rome, they decided
to suspend the whole thing

310
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:15,372
because it wasn't necessary.

311
00:25:16,214 --> 00:25:17,806
Let's hurry!

312
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:22,013
There's nothing we can do
for the woman

313
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,054
even if we get there in time.

314
00:25:24,155 --> 00:25:27,352
You know perfectly well
we can't afford any witnesses.

315
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:28,920
Then stop!

316
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:31,222
I'll get out!

317
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:39,434
What's the use of going? You go!

318
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:48,837
<i>Dottore</i> Marcello!

319
00:25:51,182 --> 00:25:53,980
But we have to be there.
We have a certain responsibility.

320
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:55,950
Would you look at that!

321
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:58,488
Stop!

322
00:26:04,195 --> 00:26:06,163
Who makes the report otherwise?

323
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:08,022
Unbutton his pants!

324
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:13,302
Let me up! Let me up!

325
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:16,067
The police! The police! Come on!

326
00:26:51,977 --> 00:26:53,035
Stop!

327
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:06,723
- <i>What's your name?</i>
- <i>Marcello Clerici. What's yours?</i>

328
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:09,419
<i>Pasqualino Semirama.
But call me Lino.</i>

329
00:27:20,705 --> 00:27:23,003
How long is it since
your last confession?

330
00:27:23,108 --> 00:27:24,405
Since I made my first Holy Communion.

331
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:26,409
Bad, my son, very bad.

332
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:29,242
- How old are you?
- Thirty-four.

333
00:27:29,547 --> 00:27:32,846
And all this time
you have lived like an animal.

334
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:37,045
Tell me, which sins
have you committed?

335
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:40,519
I've committed them all.
Even the worst sin.

336
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:44,391
- All?
- All. Even murder.

337
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:49,626
Murder? And you didn't
feel the need to confess?

338
00:27:50,301 --> 00:27:51,325
Pardon?

339
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:54,928
You didn't feel the need
to rush to confession?

340
00:27:57,876 --> 00:27:59,138
I was 13.

341
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:32,375
Well, what were your friends
trying to do?

342
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:33,774
They're just stupid.

343
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:35,675
What did they want from you?

344
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,061
All right, then, what present?

345
00:28:58,603 --> 00:28:59,627
A gun.

346
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:02,104
- A cap pistol?
- No, a real one.

347
00:29:02,707 --> 00:29:05,676
I have one, too. A Mauser.

348
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:09,407
You want it?
If you want it, I'll give it to you.

349
00:29:09,614 --> 00:29:12,777
- Where is it?
- It's in my room. Come.

350
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:17,286
I have a pretty oriental kimono, too.

351
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:21,453
- Do you know who Madame Butterfly is?
- Where are you going?

352
00:30:23,588 --> 00:30:26,819
Go on, tell me.
What did he want from you?

353
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:29,917
I didn't know what.
He was so much like a woman.

354
00:30:30,028 --> 00:30:32,496
- A woman?
- He trembled like a woman.

355
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:35,758
<i>Well, what happened? Kisses?</i>

356
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:38,034
<i>Touching you?</i>

357
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:42,234
Are you sure you're telling me the truth?

358
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:45,169
Yes.

359
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:50,210
And what happened there between you?
Carnal relations?

360
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:56,111
Shoot. What are you waiting for?
Go on, shoot.

361
00:30:56,221 --> 00:30:57,916
Kill the pretty butterfly!

362
00:31:36,327 --> 00:31:40,024
- Now you must tell me the details.
- No, that's enough, please.

363
00:31:40,131 --> 00:31:42,497
It's almost as though you think sodomy

364
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,864
is a more mortal sin
than killing somebody, <i>padre.</i>

365
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:47,062
I won't permit such insolence.

366
00:31:47,171 --> 00:31:49,071
You are forgetting
that I happen to be the priest,

367
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:50,868
and you the sinner.

368
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:56,108
After that once, did you have
sexual relations with other men?

369
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:59,345
No. All the rest were normal.

370
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:01,042
Which means what?

371
00:32:01,152 --> 00:32:03,120
A brothel when I was 18.

372
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,883
Since then,
relationships only with women.

373
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:10,449
This in your opinion
is a sexual life that's normal?

374
00:32:10,561 --> 00:32:12,256
Yes. But why?

375
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:15,461
But you, my son,
have always lived in sin.

376
00:32:16,734 --> 00:32:21,637
Normal means matrimony,
having a wife, family.

377
00:32:22,373 --> 00:32:23,965
That's what I find.

378
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:26,942
Bravo, bravo, bravo.

379
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:29,741
I'm going to build a life that's normal.

380
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:32,480
I'm marrying a petty bourgeois.

381
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:35,881
Then she must be a fine girl.

382
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,857
Speak out. Go ahead!

383
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,058
Mediocre.

384
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:50,233
A mound of petty ideas.

385
00:32:51,836 --> 00:32:54,100
Full of petty ambitions.

386
00:32:55,073 --> 00:32:56,938
She's all bed and kitchen.

387
00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:59,407
You have no right
to use such expressions.

388
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:00,807
Normality.

389
00:33:01,913 --> 00:33:05,440
I intend to construct my normality,
but it won't be easy.

390
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:08,348
- Stay within religion...
- Outside religion!

391
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:12,252
God is so bountiful.
The Virgin is so maternal.

392
00:33:12,857 --> 00:33:15,155
Christ is so merciful to us all.

393
00:33:15,693 --> 00:33:19,390
And the priest is so blessed
with understanding.

394
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:25,297
You haven't demonstrated
any horror at my crime yet.

395
00:33:25,403 --> 00:33:27,564
It didn't make you pause.

396
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:31,574
You're surprised because I didn't run
to confession right away.

397
00:33:31,776 --> 00:33:34,108
The one thing you have to do
is repent humbly,

398
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:35,440
ask His pardon today.

399
00:33:35,546 --> 00:33:39,846
I've already repented.
I want to be excused by society.

400
00:33:40,551 --> 00:33:41,575
Yes.

401
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:46,154
I want to confess today
the sin I'll commit tomorrow.

402
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:48,383
One sin atones for another.

403
00:33:48,826 --> 00:33:52,353
It is the price I must pay society.
And I shall pay it.

404
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:54,664
Are you a part of some new sect?

405
00:33:54,766 --> 00:33:57,428
Do you belong
to a group of subversives?

406
00:33:57,902 --> 00:34:00,166
No. No.

407
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:05,435
I belong to a group that
tracks down all the subversives.

408
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:08,877
<i>Ego te absolvo</i>

409
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:11,010
<i>a peccatis tuis.</i>

410
00:34:12,016 --> 00:34:13,142
Music!

411
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:41,672
Long live the bridegroom!

412
00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:43,576
Long live the bridegroom!

413
00:34:43,681 --> 00:34:44,978
Congratulations!

414
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,381
- When is the wedding?
- Next Sunday.

415
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:49,282
The bride, why didn't you bring her?

416
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:50,615
What's her name?

417
00:34:50,721 --> 00:34:54,953
Let's drink to the end of bachelorhood!

418
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:59,158
- We have biscuits, too.
- Crackers as well.

419
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:06,062
Only a drop. Pour me just a drop.

420
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:08,229
It goes to my head quickly.

421
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:24,712
- The party makes me nervous.
- People wanted to meet you.

422
00:35:28,826 --> 00:35:32,728
- Never mind. It's just a tray.
- Good, good. It's a lucky sign.

423
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:39,434
You know, they're so excited.

424
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:45,305
Whenever there's an event,
people get excited.

425
00:35:45,576 --> 00:35:47,510
Forgive them.

426
00:35:47,612 --> 00:35:51,104
- I'm going on a mission.
- Good!

427
00:35:55,019 --> 00:35:58,113
Your performance was wonderful.

428
00:35:58,222 --> 00:36:01,316
- I appreciate it.
- I am never refused.

429
00:36:04,095 --> 00:36:08,327
Music. Come on, let's play.

430
00:36:15,873 --> 00:36:19,934
People are waiting
to speak with the <i>Duce.</i>

431
00:36:20,144 --> 00:36:23,602
Suddenly a frightful scream is heard.

432
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,515
That's enough.

433
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:42,031
Where are you? Started again?

434
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:47,036
Last time's lesson wasn't enough
for you? Stop crying.

435
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:50,934
I shall play for you
the last part of "Foxtrot" by Maestro Lori.

436
00:36:58,516 --> 00:37:01,952
What do you get
out of working for the man?

437
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:07,214
I get the feeling I'm finally back

438
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:10,021
to the normal state I mentioned to you.

439
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:16,563
- How do you think a normal man...
- A normal man!

440
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:21,900
For me, a normal man is one

441
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:27,607
who turns his head to see
a beautiful woman's bottom.

442
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:31,476
The point is not just to turn your head.

443
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:33,550
There are 5-6 reasons,

444
00:37:34,552 --> 00:37:39,990
and he is glad to find people
who are like him, his equals.

445
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:43,359
That's why he likes crowded beaches,

446
00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:45,486
football, the bar downtown...

447
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:47,723
At Piazza Venezia.

448
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:51,929
He likes people similar to himself

449
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:55,199
and does not trust
those who are different.

450
00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:59,807
That's why a normal man is
a true brother, a true citizen,

451
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:02,378
- a true patriot.
- A true Fascist.

452
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:11,417
You haven't ever wondered
how come we're friends?

453
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:16,117
Since we're different from the others.

454
00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:19,429
We are two of a kind.

455
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:24,901
Are you here?

456
00:38:28,439 --> 00:38:32,899
What's the matter, you don't agree?
I know you do.

457
00:38:33,277 --> 00:38:35,211
I am never wrong.

458
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:40,540
It rains from the scattered clouds

459
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:43,586
It rains on the parched
tamarisks about you

460
00:38:43,921 --> 00:38:46,253
The happy pines glistening dew

461
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:49,983
And upon the myrtles it rains anew

462
00:38:50,561 --> 00:38:52,654
It rains upon our naked hands

463
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:54,697
On our transparent vestments

464
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:57,791
On the new thoughts our souls reveal

465
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:03,198
And on the fable
that eluded me yesterday

466
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:06,505
And eludes me today, Hermione

467
00:39:24,895 --> 00:39:27,728
Marcello, I am unworthy of you.

468
00:39:28,966 --> 00:39:31,594
Marcello, I am unworthy of you.

469
00:39:32,937 --> 00:39:35,599
Yes, yes. I don't deserve you.

470
00:39:36,173 --> 00:39:38,573
You sound the same as your mother.

471
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:46,644
I have something to tell you,
but you mustn't look at me,

472
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:49,879
so please look out there.
If you look, I'll be ashamed.

473
00:39:53,457 --> 00:39:55,652
Maybe afterwards
you won't love me anymore,

474
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,126
but I've got to tell you.

475
00:39:58,696 --> 00:40:02,723
You know,
what you think of me isn't true.

476
00:40:03,701 --> 00:40:07,228
You think I'm a virgin. I'm not.

477
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:12,499
What do you think of me now?

478
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:15,940
I didn't marry you because
I thought you're still a virgin.

479
00:40:16,046 --> 00:40:18,378
Dearest, I know
your mentality's modern,

480
00:40:18,482 --> 00:40:21,076
but then I felt I should tell you the truth.

481
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:23,481
I forgot to mention it.

482
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:27,349
At Ventimiglia, we'll get off.
I've got an appointment.

483
00:40:28,392 --> 00:40:31,520
But I have to tell you
the whole thing. I have to.

484
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:38,601
You're angry.

485
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:43,267
You were in love with someone
before you met me. Who was it?

486
00:40:44,008 --> 00:40:47,171
He was a man of 60.
A very disgusting old man.

487
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,348
A friend of my family's.

488
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:56,181
- Who is it?
- It's the Advocate Perpuzio.

489
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:57,549
Perpuzio?

490
00:40:59,924 --> 00:41:02,825
- But he's one of our witnesses.
- He insisted on it.

491
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:05,122
But how was I going to say no?

492
00:41:10,568 --> 00:41:13,128
- Six years it went on.
- Six years?

493
00:41:14,705 --> 00:41:16,002
Six years.

494
00:41:20,277 --> 00:41:21,301
All right.

495
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:24,006
<i>Pardon, monsieur.</i>
We'll be in Ventimiglia in a few minutes.

496
00:41:24,114 --> 00:41:25,342
Thank you.

497
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:38,656
- This is number three Via dei Glicini?
- Number three.

498
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:03,811
Who is it?

499
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:06,947
He looked to me like he might be
an officer in civvies!

500
00:42:20,671 --> 00:42:23,697
This isn't a museum.
Go inside, go inside!

501
00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:28,369
I'll send the others down right away.

502
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:32,105
I'm an idiot, a complete maniac.

503
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:37,987
Again! Say it again.

504
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:40,889
The gentleman is a friend
of <i>Signor</i> Raoul's.

505
00:42:40,991 --> 00:42:43,357
Go on! Say it!

506
00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:47,321
I'm crazy, a complete maniac.

507
00:42:54,939 --> 00:42:56,236
I'm crazy.

508
00:43:05,182 --> 00:43:06,444
Clerici!

509
00:43:07,284 --> 00:43:09,548
What are you doing wasting time?

510
00:43:09,653 --> 00:43:10,950
Come here!

511
00:43:17,027 --> 00:43:18,051
What?

512
00:43:18,162 --> 00:43:21,188
Professor Quadri's activities in France

513
00:43:21,298 --> 00:43:23,630
have become interfering
and provocative.

514
00:43:23,734 --> 00:43:26,828
It's become necessary
to make an example of him.

515
00:43:28,138 --> 00:43:31,301
You had to contact and inspire
him with confidence

516
00:43:31,408 --> 00:43:32,966
and get information.

517
00:43:33,077 --> 00:43:35,602
- But now...
- But now?

518
00:43:36,914 --> 00:43:40,816
There's a counter-order from Rome.
All you do is eliminate him.

519
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:45,081
- That clear?
- Very.

520
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:49,086
The operation will not
take place in Paris.

521
00:43:49,193 --> 00:43:52,424
It's up to you to choose
the locale and the moment.

522
00:43:54,531 --> 00:43:56,021
It's up to you.

523
00:44:02,539 --> 00:44:05,030
There's nothing more to talk about.

524
00:44:05,442 --> 00:44:08,878
Fine. This means I have no alternative.

525
00:44:10,414 --> 00:44:12,006
Comrade Clerici!

526
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:15,450
It must be quick and decisive! Comrade!

527
00:44:21,759 --> 00:44:24,557
The train for Paris leaves in an hour.

528
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:29,993
I lost my hat. Where's my hat?
Where is it?

529
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:38,506
Then he entered the room. Slowly.

530
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:41,671
Finally he stood behind me
and said, "Is that French?"

531
00:44:41,779 --> 00:44:43,474
Come and sit here.

532
00:44:47,117 --> 00:44:49,415
"It's my Latin lesson," I said.

533
00:44:50,287 --> 00:44:52,255
He grabbed me by my hair.

534
00:44:55,626 --> 00:44:58,493
And then, imagine,
I used to call him Uncle.

535
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:02,859
He unbuttoned my blouse then.

536
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:16,202
I was well-developed at 15, I guess.

537
00:45:18,182 --> 00:45:22,209
He began to squeeze my breasts
harder until I almost fainted.

538
00:45:29,793 --> 00:45:34,059
And then, I don't know.
I was suddenly on the bed.

539
00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:39,230
He was on top of me.

540
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:39,570
Then I understood everything
and all my strength left me.

541
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:43,404
Then I understood everything
and all my strength left me.

542
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:54,408
Did you like it?

543
00:45:55,285 --> 00:45:57,412
- I lay there passive.
- And then?

544
00:45:57,521 --> 00:45:59,921
He did everything to me he wanted.

545
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:13,336
I cried so much,
and in order to console me,

546
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:16,838
he said he was absolutely,
absolutely crazy about me.

547
00:46:18,242 --> 00:46:19,709
Six years.

548
00:46:55,078 --> 00:46:57,638
I would like 26, 15, 37.

549
00:46:57,748 --> 00:47:01,650
- Length nine and width...
- I'll wait.

550
00:47:02,186 --> 00:47:05,314
Who are you telephoning to?
One, two, three, four...

551
00:47:05,422 --> 00:47:08,289
- A man with a hump.
- Hunchbacks bring good luck!

552
00:47:08,392 --> 00:47:09,950
Five and six.

553
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:15,120
Six by nine ought to amount
to 54 meters square, isn't it?

554
00:47:15,232 --> 00:47:16,722
That's right.

555
00:47:16,967 --> 00:47:19,663
He was our professor at the university.

556
00:47:21,638 --> 00:47:23,629
They named him Smerdikoff.

557
00:47:24,374 --> 00:47:27,241
But his was the only class
that was crowded.

558
00:47:27,945 --> 00:47:30,846
All the freshman girls
were in love with him.

559
00:47:32,883 --> 00:47:34,214
Still busy?

560
00:47:36,153 --> 00:47:39,316
Please, in a few minutes
will you ring it for me?

561
00:47:41,925 --> 00:47:45,918
The year I was supposed to graduate,
they gave him the castor oil.

562
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:48,998
He won't remember after nine years.

563
00:47:49,666 --> 00:47:52,294
I had to go and ask him for my thesis.

564
00:47:54,438 --> 00:47:56,497
He asked me if I was a Fascist.

565
00:47:56,607 --> 00:47:58,268
And what did you answer?

566
00:47:58,942 --> 00:48:01,172
I didn't bother to answer him.

567
00:48:02,746 --> 00:48:04,771
He told me it would be
impossible for him

568
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:07,715
to teach philosophy in a Fascist country.

569
00:48:08,452 --> 00:48:09,578
Hello.

570
00:48:11,288 --> 00:48:13,813
This is Clerici.
I was a student of yours back in Rome,

571
00:48:13,924 --> 00:48:16,119
and I'd like to see you again.

572
00:48:18,595 --> 00:48:21,996
Of course, Professor.
I came about my graduate thesis.

573
00:48:22,466 --> 00:48:25,162
It was the year that
you stopped teaching.

574
00:48:25,269 --> 00:48:26,998
<i>I don't remember your name.</i>

575
00:48:27,104 --> 00:48:29,766
<i>It was so long ago.
Clerici, you said?</i>

576
00:48:29,873 --> 00:48:34,173
Yes. And you said to me...
I remember that day so well, everything,

577
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:37,676
you said,
"The time for reflection is over for me.

578
00:48:37,781 --> 00:48:39,612
"Now begins the time for action."

579
00:48:39,716 --> 00:48:42,947
- <i>And you want to see me?</i>
- Yes.

580
00:48:43,186 --> 00:48:44,210
<i>Why?</i>

581
00:48:45,188 --> 00:48:47,486
I don't have any precise reason.

582
00:48:48,058 --> 00:48:50,151
They still speak about you in Rome.

583
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:52,751
And I'd like to see you, that's all.

584
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:56,790
<i>Let's see.</i>
<i>Could you come over to my house?</i>

585
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:58,868
Yes. When?

586
00:48:59,169 --> 00:49:02,696
<i>Today if you like, after lunch.</i>
<i>Come and have a coffee.</i>

587
00:49:02,806 --> 00:49:05,775
I'm honeymooning in Paris.

588
00:49:06,076 --> 00:49:08,044
Would it be all right
if I brought my wife?

589
00:49:08,145 --> 00:49:10,170
<i>Of course.</i>
<i>Seventeen Rue Saint Jacques.</i>

590
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,771
- <i>I'll see you later then.</i>
- Thank you.

591
00:49:14,651 --> 00:49:17,552
He has a nice voice.
Not like a hunchback's.

592
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:22,652
What shall I wear?
Street clothes or really get dressed up?

593
00:49:24,895 --> 00:49:26,385
But why bother?

594
00:49:27,331 --> 00:49:30,323
He'll be a typical intellectual,
disagreeable and impotent.

595
00:49:30,434 --> 00:49:31,765
How do you know that?

596
00:49:31,868 --> 00:49:34,996
I don't really.
My uncle used to always say...

597
00:49:35,105 --> 00:49:37,437
- Uncle Perpuzio!
- Laugh, laugh.

598
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:41,368
Only he's the one
who sent the anonymous letter.

599
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:49,918
Cut that out!

600
00:49:50,854 --> 00:49:52,344
But, Marcello...

601
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:01,891
Answer that. Say I'm not in.

602
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:06,067
- But what if it's a foreigner?
- No, he'll be an Italian.

603
00:50:06,737 --> 00:50:08,329
Answer the phone!

604
00:50:12,309 --> 00:50:13,742
Hello?

605
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:15,444
No, he's not in.

606
00:50:15,979 --> 00:50:18,004
Very well, I'll tell him.

607
00:50:18,115 --> 00:50:20,777
He said he'd call back this afternoon.

608
00:50:21,318 --> 00:50:23,286
Funny name, Manganiello.

609
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:28,411
- Yes, what is it?
- I'm <i>Monsieur</i> Clerici.

610
00:51:28,518 --> 00:51:32,682
- You've got the wrong apartment.
- I've an appointment.

611
00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:33,983
You're Italian?

612
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:37,151
The professor is expecting them.
I'll take care.

613
00:51:45,368 --> 00:51:46,801
Get away, Marcello!

614
00:51:50,474 --> 00:51:54,103
He'll bite you! Run!

615
00:52:00,717 --> 00:52:02,116
Down, Roby!

616
00:52:02,819 --> 00:52:04,810
Get down! Sit down!

617
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:16,788
You're <i>Monsieur</i> Clerici, aren't you?

618
00:52:17,367 --> 00:52:18,595
Come in.

619
00:52:22,906 --> 00:52:26,398
- Nothing to be afraid of.
- Me? I'm not a bit frightened.

620
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:29,741
Well then come up.
He won't bite now, I tell you.

621
00:52:30,113 --> 00:52:32,445
Funny, usually dogs like me.

622
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:38,781
Is this the first time
you're visiting Paris?

623
00:52:38,889 --> 00:52:41,619
- Do you like it?
- Yes. It's so pretty.

624
00:52:41,725 --> 00:52:44,922
The station, the hotel, and now here.

625
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:49,393
- Please.
- Thank you.

626
00:52:53,436 --> 00:52:56,701
If you like,
later I could show you a bit of the town.

627
00:52:57,073 --> 00:52:59,735
Really? And then
when you come to Italy,

628
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:01,902
I can show you
around Rome, everything.

629
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:04,003
The piazzas, the churches, the Forum...

630
00:53:04,114 --> 00:53:05,274
Yes.

631
00:53:08,051 --> 00:53:11,077
I should get them
or the coffee will be frozen.

632
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:13,884
Come on, boys,
the coffee's getting cold.

633
00:53:14,824 --> 00:53:17,224
I wonder why she seems so hostile.

634
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:20,830
Does she seem hostile?
But she's nice to me.

635
00:53:20,931 --> 00:53:23,798
She acts like
she knows me a hundred years.

636
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:26,334
And I don't know why. I never met her.

637
00:53:26,436 --> 00:53:28,233
Don't even know who she is.

638
00:53:28,338 --> 00:53:30,272
She's married to Professor Quadri.

639
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:32,398
Young enough to be his daughter.

640
00:53:32,509 --> 00:53:35,876
But it doesn't matter. I heard her saying,
"My husband's inside."

641
00:53:35,979 --> 00:53:38,209
- She said "my husband"?
- But certainly.

642
00:53:38,315 --> 00:53:40,408
No, I don't agree.
Printing in the shop is too expensive.

643
00:53:40,517 --> 00:53:42,610
But we'll never accomplish
anything with the mimeograph.

644
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:46,052
- Thirty thousand copies is no joke...
- It always breaks down.

645
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:09,644
My husband's still busy.

646
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:11,373
He'll see you in a few minutes, all right?

647
00:54:11,481 --> 00:54:15,110
- Yes, we've got time.
- He said we might dine tonight.

648
00:54:15,218 --> 00:54:16,480
We'd love to.

649
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:19,646
Later we might stop
at Joinville and dance.

650
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:22,486
- You agree?
- Dancing makes me so happy!

651
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:25,527
Is dancing still allowed in Italy?

652
00:54:26,162 --> 00:54:29,598
Now that I think of it, it's impossible.

653
00:54:29,699 --> 00:54:30,723
Why?

654
00:54:32,469 --> 00:54:33,902
'Cause I didn't bring a gown with me.

655
00:54:34,004 --> 00:54:37,462
We can fix that. This afternoon,
we can shop if you'll come.

656
00:54:37,574 --> 00:54:42,375
- Shouldn't we go immediately?
- No. I have a class at school at 3:30.

657
00:54:42,479 --> 00:54:45,414
But we can meet at your hotel
if you like at 5:00.

658
00:54:45,515 --> 00:54:47,847
- At what hotel are you?
- At the D'Orsay.

659
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:50,784
- Then we'll see you at 5:00?
- No.

660
00:54:51,321 --> 00:54:54,757
Shopping is only for women.
Husbands pay.

661
00:54:54,858 --> 00:54:57,418
You mean I can go and you won't mind?

662
00:54:57,527 --> 00:54:58,516
No.

663
00:54:59,396 --> 00:55:01,421
Take him to the professor.

664
00:55:19,215 --> 00:55:22,048
Come in, come in, Clerici.
Did they give you coffee?

665
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:25,280
- Yes, thank you.
- Goodbye. Thank you.

666
00:55:25,388 --> 00:55:26,446
- Giulia.
- Yes.

667
00:55:26,556 --> 00:55:27,818
I'm curious.

668
00:55:27,924 --> 00:55:31,155
Before you married him,
did you go to bed with him?

669
00:55:31,261 --> 00:55:33,320
It's very curious, Clerici.

670
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:37,466
You come all this way only to see me?

671
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:40,693
Remember, Professor,

672
00:55:41,438 --> 00:55:43,736
as soon as you used
to enter the classroom

673
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,808
they had to shut the windows.

674
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:48,878
You couldn't stand all that light,
that noise.

675
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:52,345
Later, I understood why you used
to do that.

676
00:55:52,449 --> 00:55:54,280
All these years,

677
00:55:54,384 --> 00:55:58,115
you know what remained
most firmly imprinted on my memory?

678
00:55:58,221 --> 00:55:59,552
Your voice.

679
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:04,751
Imagine a great dungeon
in the shape of a cave.

680
00:56:05,595 --> 00:56:09,497
Inside, men who have
lived there since childhood,

681
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:14,336
all chained, and forced
to face the back of the cave.

682
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:19,206
Behind them, far away,
the light from a fire flickers.

683
00:56:20,276 --> 00:56:23,404
Between the fire and the prisoners,
imagine a low wall

684
00:56:23,513 --> 00:56:25,071
similar to that little stage

685
00:56:25,181 --> 00:56:27,809
on which a puppeteer
shows his puppets.

686
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:33,955
That was November '28.

687
00:56:36,292 --> 00:56:38,055
Yes, I remember.

688
00:56:41,297 --> 00:56:43,697
Now try and imagine some other men

689
00:56:44,634 --> 00:56:46,932
passing behind that little wall

690
00:56:47,771 --> 00:56:51,332
bearing statues
made of wood and stone.

691
00:56:52,208 --> 00:56:54,335
The statues are higher than that wall.

692
00:56:54,444 --> 00:56:58,676
You couldn't have brought me
a better gift than these memories.

693
00:56:58,782 --> 00:57:01,342
The enchained prisoners of Plato.

694
00:57:01,451 --> 00:57:03,578
And how they resemble us.

695
00:57:03,686 --> 00:57:06,519
- And what do they see?
- What do they see?

696
00:57:07,357 --> 00:57:11,157
You who come from Italy
should know from experience.

697
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:13,593
They see only the shadows
the fire makes

698
00:57:13,696 --> 00:57:16,392
on the back of the cavern
that faces them.

699
00:57:16,499 --> 00:57:18,467
Shadows. The reflections of things.

700
00:57:18,568 --> 00:57:21,765
Like what's happening
to you people now in Italy.

701
00:57:22,338 --> 00:57:24,966
Say those prisoners were at liberty
and could speak out.

702
00:57:25,074 --> 00:57:28,237
Mightn't they call the shadows
they see reality, not visions?

703
00:57:28,344 --> 00:57:33,509
Yes. They would mistake for reality,
the shadows of reality.

704
00:57:35,351 --> 00:57:37,649
The myth of the great cave.

705
00:57:38,087 --> 00:57:40,783
That was the graduate thesis
you proposed to do for me.

706
00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:44,519
- Did you finish it afterwards?
- You departed. I used a different theme.

707
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:48,290
I'm truly sorry, Clerici.
I had so much faith in you.

708
00:57:50,033 --> 00:57:52,501
- In all of you.
- No, I don't believe it.

709
00:57:52,602 --> 00:57:55,571
If that were true,
you'd never have left Rome.

710
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:58,372
That's fine. Go on!

711
00:58:00,009 --> 00:58:01,943
Move faster. Move faster.

712
00:58:02,545 --> 00:58:04,604
Move faster. Move faster.

713
00:58:04,948 --> 00:58:06,882
Move faster. Move faster.

714
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:10,510
At the point we had reached
there was no other choice.

715
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:12,611
All we could do was emigrate.
We wanted everyone

716
00:58:12,722 --> 00:58:15,919
to be able to feel our disdain,
and our rebellion as exiles,

717
00:58:16,025 --> 00:58:19,222
the meaning of our struggle,
the historical meaning.

718
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:22,696
Beautiful words, but you left
and I became a Fascist.

719
00:58:23,032 --> 00:58:24,795
Excuse me, Clerici,

720
00:58:25,301 --> 00:58:28,327
but a confirmed Fascist
doesn't talk like that.

721
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:38,113
Yes? Yes, it's me. Yes. Go ahead.

722
00:58:42,952 --> 00:58:45,250
One lover? Only one?

723
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:48,054
She went down and out.

724
00:58:48,157 --> 00:58:50,523
She gave her all for a redheaded pimp
with a bloodshot eye.

725
00:58:50,627 --> 00:58:54,154
A Jew he was, with a garlic smell.
Who'd come from Formosa once,

726
00:58:54,264 --> 00:58:56,858
and hauled her out of
some whorehouse in Shanghai.

727
00:58:56,966 --> 00:58:59,025
You really will lend me these foxes?

728
00:58:59,135 --> 00:59:00,864
Of course.
Keep them as long as you like.

729
00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:02,301
Thank you.

730
00:59:09,445 --> 00:59:11,777
Wait for me. I'll be right back.

731
00:59:25,662 --> 00:59:27,755
Do you often go around
people's houses spying?

732
00:59:27,864 --> 00:59:30,355
How often do I honeymoon in France?

733
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:33,030
I met a woman with your eyes.

734
00:59:33,436 --> 00:59:35,199
- Where?
- Ventimiglia.

735
00:59:37,607 --> 00:59:39,973
The resemblance is unbelievable.

736
00:59:41,277 --> 00:59:44,007
- And who was she?
- A prostitute.

737
00:59:49,452 --> 00:59:50,817
Many thanks.

738
00:59:51,621 --> 00:59:54,784
- Did she kiss well?
- It would be like kissing you.

739
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:59,660
- How did it end up then?
- It didn't.

740
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:02,060
I embraced her and that was it.

741
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:06,466
I was left with this great desire
to find her again.

742
01:00:06,569 --> 01:00:10,699
- Why are you so hostile?
- Because I'm sincere.

743
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:16,278
Over here she had a scar.

744
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:24,352
No! No! Let me go!

745
01:01:25,114 --> 01:01:26,877
Who knows what it's for?

746
01:01:26,983 --> 01:01:28,883
But it isn't gold the way I imagined.

747
01:01:28,985 --> 01:01:32,079
From here it's almost as small
as the one I have on my night table.

748
01:01:32,188 --> 01:01:33,746
They say at least once a month,

749
01:01:33,856 --> 01:01:37,257
some disappointed lover
throws himself off. How stupid.

750
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:40,724
- You want to go to the Tower?
- Yes.

751
01:01:46,969 --> 01:01:48,027
Taxi!

752
01:01:48,137 --> 01:01:51,834
Yes. I'm glad we're going up
the Eiffel Tower.

753
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:03,848
Quick! To the Eiffel Tower<i>. Ciao!</i>

754
01:02:04,787 --> 01:02:07,381
And you?

755
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:21,801
Attention!

756
01:02:22,538 --> 01:02:25,371
Now, supple. Go on. Hup!

757
01:02:27,143 --> 01:02:28,906
Helene dear, chin up.

758
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:32,972
Hup!

759
01:02:35,051 --> 01:02:36,678
Try it again now.

760
01:02:40,523 --> 01:02:42,957
Watch your knees, Denise.

761
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:45,917
Take a breath.

762
01:02:50,233 --> 01:02:52,929
That's starting to look good, isn't it?

763
01:02:57,540 --> 01:02:58,837
Your head.

764
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:05,838
Your points out.

765
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:08,845
Eyes still, Margot.

766
01:03:21,397 --> 01:03:22,830
Take a break.

767
01:03:25,935 --> 01:03:27,596
Thank you, madame.

768
01:03:35,611 --> 01:03:38,011
- Is there some place to talk?
- Here.

769
01:03:38,114 --> 01:03:40,014
- No, not here.
- Why not?

770
01:03:52,195 --> 01:03:54,425
I have some friends in Brazil.

771
01:03:54,697 --> 01:03:57,495
I'll leave everything if you come with me.

772
01:03:58,968 --> 01:04:01,937
I, on the other hand,
have friends in Italy.

773
01:04:02,038 --> 01:04:04,233
I received a letter. Read it.

774
01:04:08,144 --> 01:04:12,547
"If you ever get this letter,
it will be in spite of the prison censors."

775
01:04:13,249 --> 01:04:16,616
You must never make the gesture
as wide as this.

776
01:04:18,421 --> 01:04:20,389
Why did you stop? Go on.

777
01:04:23,292 --> 01:04:25,783
"They come suddenly in the night
and kick the door of my cell

778
01:04:25,895 --> 01:04:27,988
"so as not to let me sleep."

779
01:04:29,465 --> 01:04:31,399
- Why do...
- Continue.

780
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:33,900
Why do you make me read this letter?

781
01:04:34,003 --> 01:04:35,868
I'll tell you in a bit.

782
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:40,441
"Some days,
there are the false executions.

783
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:44,240
"They sent me the priest
three times already

784
01:04:44,347 --> 01:04:46,872
"and I refused extreme unction.

785
01:04:46,983 --> 01:04:49,349
"They gave me castor oil again,
but they should realize

786
01:04:49,452 --> 01:04:51,545
"that after almost 20 years,

787
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:54,879
"I'm used to it. It has no effect."

788
01:04:55,858 --> 01:04:57,758
Why must I read this letter?

789
01:04:57,860 --> 01:04:59,953
You want me to tell you?

790
01:05:00,062 --> 01:05:02,394
Because you're a Fascist! A spy!

791
01:05:02,999 --> 01:05:05,900
You imagine you took us in?
You're mistaken.

792
01:05:08,271 --> 01:05:09,704
Does your husband know?

793
01:05:09,805 --> 01:05:12,069
Why do you think you were received?

794
01:05:13,609 --> 01:05:15,042
You're only a worm.

795
01:05:15,144 --> 01:05:17,544
You revolt me! You're disgusting!

796
01:05:19,515 --> 01:05:21,847
I'm getting Giulia at the hotel.

797
01:05:21,951 --> 01:05:23,942
We'll be on the first train home.

798
01:05:24,053 --> 01:05:27,079
You'd never do it.
You're too much of a coward.

799
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:54,549
Marcello! Hold me.

800
01:06:05,294 --> 01:06:07,262
Marcello, I'm frightened.

801
01:06:09,899 --> 01:06:12,197
Marcello, please don't hurt us.

802
01:06:16,772 --> 01:06:19,263
Swear it! Swear it, please.

803
01:06:20,343 --> 01:06:21,776
I don't know.

804
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:06,850
Giulia, look at this.

805
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:15,592
Anna! Come here!

806
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:19,658
It's a surprise!

807
01:07:22,371 --> 01:07:25,807
Look at that color. It's a dream!

808
01:07:25,908 --> 01:07:28,638
Come and look at this one. Here.

809
01:07:32,148 --> 01:07:34,946
Anna! It's divine!

810
01:07:37,186 --> 01:07:39,677
Look how beautiful it is! Just look!

811
01:07:42,324 --> 01:07:43,882
Giulia, come on.

812
01:07:59,942 --> 01:08:03,036
It's very big, all in wood,
with enormous beds.

813
01:08:03,412 --> 01:08:04,811
The house belonged to my grandfather.

814
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:07,007
Luca and I used to go there often.

815
01:08:07,116 --> 01:08:08,606
Roby, here!

816
01:08:08,717 --> 01:08:12,676
But now with what's going on in Spain,
we don't leave Paris any longer.

817
01:08:12,788 --> 01:08:15,552
All right, Roby! That's enough!
Come here!

818
01:08:15,858 --> 01:08:18,622
La Savoie is beautiful.
I can't wait to get back.

819
01:08:36,312 --> 01:08:40,339
<i>Dottore! Dottore!</i>

820
01:08:41,016 --> 01:08:43,644
Come on, I know you're back there.

821
01:08:43,752 --> 01:08:46,243
Why don't you want to see me?

822
01:08:46,355 --> 01:08:48,550
I've been running after you all day.

823
01:08:48,657 --> 01:08:51,353
And it's freezing here.

824
01:08:54,597 --> 01:08:57,395
You ought to come out
and have a chat now.

825
01:08:58,934 --> 01:09:01,368
What is it you're worrying about?

826
01:09:01,804 --> 01:09:04,830
We'll go somewhere inside.
We'll talk about it.

827
01:09:06,509 --> 01:09:08,477
I have my job, you know.

828
01:09:09,778 --> 01:09:11,507
The time's passing.

829
01:09:14,049 --> 01:09:18,213
You must have a plan by now.

830
01:09:18,587 --> 01:09:21,283
You haven't stood still for an instant.

831
01:09:22,491 --> 01:09:25,619
May I say you ought to be following him,
not his wife.

832
01:09:25,728 --> 01:09:29,095
There's no point in screaming like that
at the birds, you know.

833
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:32,099
They don't understand
you foreigners. Maniac.

834
01:09:32,301 --> 01:09:35,168
He thinks the birds
in Paris are foreigners.

835
01:09:36,272 --> 01:09:39,298
God damn it<i>. Dottore!</i>

836
01:09:39,975 --> 01:09:41,772
I do understand you.

837
01:09:42,278 --> 01:09:45,179
But the operation must be
quick and decisive.

838
01:09:56,725 --> 01:09:58,090
Third floor.

839
01:10:28,023 --> 01:10:30,253
You don't mind if we stay like this a bit?

840
01:10:30,359 --> 01:10:31,326
No.

841
01:10:31,427 --> 01:10:33,122
How silly you are.

842
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:35,789
Remember what you yourself said
a while ago,

843
01:10:35,898 --> 01:10:37,957
"If I weren't married," you said.

844
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:41,230
Yes, I might have said that.
I am married.

845
01:10:41,337 --> 01:10:43,271
It doesn't mean a thing.

846
01:10:44,773 --> 01:10:47,469
You have to understand
married to whom.

847
01:10:47,576 --> 01:10:48,907
I like him.

848
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:17,424
Let's try on my new frock.

849
01:11:17,535 --> 01:11:21,164
No. Don't move. I want to dress you.

850
01:11:25,744 --> 01:11:29,646
How strange you are.
You want to be my maid now?

851
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:33,841
What difference does it make?
It's my pleasure.

852
01:11:45,797 --> 01:11:48,527
Please, don't look at me.
I'm embarrassed.

853
01:11:48,633 --> 01:11:51,761
There's nothing wrong with it.
I'm a woman just as you are.

854
01:11:51,870 --> 01:11:55,033
Yes, but you look at me in a way...

855
01:11:55,140 --> 01:11:56,505
Turn around.

856
01:12:01,246 --> 01:12:03,180
How beautiful!

857
01:12:06,284 --> 01:12:08,684
How much I love Paris!

858
01:12:11,122 --> 01:12:12,953
When Marcello sees it!

859
01:12:34,112 --> 01:12:36,307
Violets? Violets, <i>monsieur?</i>

860
01:12:38,983 --> 01:12:40,712
Do you want violets?

861
01:12:41,386 --> 01:12:43,581
These are real Parma violets.

862
01:12:45,323 --> 01:12:47,484
- They're really from Parma?
- Absolutely.

863
01:12:47,592 --> 01:12:49,184
Let me have one.

864
01:12:50,695 --> 01:12:52,026
Thank you.

865
01:12:52,731 --> 01:12:54,699
"Ye prisoners of starvation!"

866
01:12:54,799 --> 01:12:57,791
<i>Arise ye prisoners of starvation</i>

867
01:12:57,902 --> 01:13:00,700
<i>Awake ye wretched of the Earth</i>

868
01:13:00,805 --> 01:13:04,206
<i>For justice thunders condemnation</i>

869
01:13:04,309 --> 01:13:07,642
<i>A better world in birth</i>

870
01:13:07,746 --> 01:13:11,409
<i>No more tradition's chains shall bind us</i>

871
01:13:11,516 --> 01:13:14,747
<i>Arise ye slaves no more in thrall</i>

872
01:13:14,853 --> 01:13:18,152
<i>The earth shall rise on new foundations</i>

873
01:13:18,256 --> 01:13:21,919
<i>We have been naught,
we shall be all</i>

874
01:13:26,531 --> 01:13:29,989
<i>'Tis the final conflict</i>

875
01:13:30,101 --> 01:13:33,400
<i>Let each stand in his place</i>

876
01:13:33,505 --> 01:13:37,601
<i>The Internationale</i>

877
01:13:37,709 --> 01:13:41,270
<i>Shall lead the human race</i>

878
01:13:41,379 --> 01:13:45,247
<i>'Tis the final conflict</i>

879
01:13:45,350 --> 01:13:48,581
<i>Let each stand in his place</i>

880
01:13:48,686 --> 01:13:52,884
<i>The Internationale</i>

881
01:13:52,991 --> 01:13:55,858
<i>Shall lead the human race</i>

882
01:13:56,528 --> 01:13:57,688
Inside.

883
01:13:59,764 --> 01:14:01,755
- Come.
- What's the matter?

884
01:14:08,973 --> 01:14:12,340
- Do you like real Parma violets?
- They're not for me.

885
01:14:15,647 --> 01:14:17,581
I want you to have them.

886
01:14:18,082 --> 01:14:20,949
You couldn't have known
I'd be at the hotel.

887
01:14:21,486 --> 01:14:23,181
They're for Giulia.

888
01:14:24,489 --> 01:14:26,650
It's for you I bought them.

889
01:14:49,681 --> 01:14:51,546
Giulia will be beautiful tonight.

890
01:14:51,649 --> 01:14:53,844
Half past eight at the hotel.

891
01:14:59,490 --> 01:15:01,117
You know, I'm sad.

892
01:15:01,826 --> 01:15:05,284
Since we've arrived in Paris,
we haven't made love yet.

893
01:15:11,269 --> 01:15:15,330
Your knees are sharp.

894
01:15:29,888 --> 01:15:31,651
Here's news for you.

895
01:15:31,990 --> 01:15:34,515
The Quadris have a house
in the Savoie.

896
01:15:34,859 --> 01:15:37,191
Anna says the Professor leaves
tomorrow morning by car

897
01:15:37,295 --> 01:15:38,785
while she stays here.

898
01:15:38,897 --> 01:15:41,730
Only for a day or so, then she's
planning to join her husband

899
01:15:41,833 --> 01:15:44,825
and wants us to visit with them
in the mountains.

900
01:15:44,936 --> 01:15:46,631
I have the address.

901
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:51,208
Nice, don't you think so?

902
01:15:58,016 --> 01:16:00,610
She told me they have
enormous beds in their villa

903
01:16:00,718 --> 01:16:03,152
which make awful noises!

904
01:16:06,257 --> 01:16:08,885
And she says there are big,
big forests in the neighborhood

905
01:16:08,993 --> 01:16:10,984
where no one ever passes.

906
01:16:17,168 --> 01:16:18,931
Anna says...

907
01:16:19,370 --> 01:16:22,430
Anna told me you can even
make love in the snow.

908
01:16:25,576 --> 01:16:29,672
Can you imagine the Professor
wandering around in the woods naked?

909
01:16:30,248 --> 01:16:33,513
You had me convinced
you were the typical new Italian.

910
01:16:33,618 --> 01:16:35,950
No such type exists yet,
but we're creating him.

911
01:16:36,054 --> 01:16:38,852
- Through repression?
- No, through example.

912
01:16:39,223 --> 01:16:42,715
Giving him castor oil?
Throwing him into prison?

913
01:16:43,294 --> 01:16:45,057
By torturing them? Blackmailing?

914
01:16:45,163 --> 01:16:48,257
Anna. Please, dear, calm down.

915
01:16:49,934 --> 01:16:52,767
Clerici is a Fascist. I'm an Anti-Fascist.

916
01:16:53,838 --> 01:16:55,271
We both knew.

917
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:57,774
And we decided to have supper
together all the same.

918
01:16:57,875 --> 01:17:00,901
- And get the wives drunk.
- The old Professor and his ex-pupil.

919
01:17:01,012 --> 01:17:05,283
- Giulia, what's the matter?
- And yet I'm willing to bet.

920
01:17:05,283 --> 01:17:05,578
- Giulia, what's the matter?
- And yet I'm willing to bet.

921
01:17:05,683 --> 01:17:07,082
God, I've drunk so much!

922
01:17:07,185 --> 01:17:10,712
- You may change your mind yet.
- Impossible, Professor.

923
01:17:11,556 --> 01:17:14,582
My husband is naive about these things.

924
01:17:15,460 --> 01:17:18,918
I can't forget that Clerici was
one of my best students ever.

925
01:17:19,030 --> 01:17:23,091
Really? Tell me.
What was Marcello like as a student?

926
01:17:23,201 --> 01:17:26,466
- Serious. Too serious.
- But you can't be too serious.

927
01:17:26,571 --> 01:17:28,505
Really serious people are never serious.

928
01:17:28,606 --> 01:17:31,803
Giulia, did you ever see
your husband laugh?

929
01:17:31,909 --> 01:17:34,639
No, but then, he's a very serious man.
That's his nature.

930
01:17:34,746 --> 01:17:37,112
- Nothing the matter with that.
- That's not my nature at all.

931
01:17:37,215 --> 01:17:39,809
I've an idea, Clerici.
You should both remain here.

932
01:17:39,917 --> 01:17:43,011
You will understand a great deal
about many things living here.

933
01:17:43,121 --> 01:17:45,749
For you, it's an important opportunity.

934
01:17:46,491 --> 01:17:48,584
What do you know, Professor?

935
01:17:48,793 --> 01:17:49,953
He's right.

936
01:17:50,061 --> 01:17:52,825
He's only in Paris
to enjoy his honeymoon.

937
01:17:52,930 --> 01:17:54,898
By the way,
did Giulia mention my idea to you?

938
01:17:54,999 --> 01:17:57,661
- We have a lovely guest room...
- With an enormous bed!

939
01:17:57,769 --> 01:18:00,237
And from la Savoie
you can go back to Italy.

940
01:18:00,338 --> 01:18:02,772
Thank you,
but I promised Giulia to show her Paris.

941
01:18:02,874 --> 01:18:04,569
I'm half-drunk already!

942
01:18:04,675 --> 01:18:07,143
That's splendid.
My husband will leave tomorrow.

943
01:18:07,245 --> 01:18:10,612
And after you see some more of Paris,
we'll join him.

944
01:18:14,385 --> 01:18:16,945
Marcello, tell the truth.
Would you like us to go?

945
01:18:17,055 --> 01:18:20,047
But of course I would.
They're really so kind.

946
01:18:20,625 --> 01:18:23,788
- Well, all right.
- Perhaps Giulia doesn't want to go.

947
01:18:23,895 --> 01:18:24,953
No, no!

948
01:18:25,063 --> 01:18:27,531
If you don't like me, you can just say so.

949
01:18:28,499 --> 01:18:30,626
Don't embarrass dear Giulia.

950
01:18:32,003 --> 01:18:35,200
- We'll definitely come. Right, Giulia?
- Yes.

951
01:18:36,674 --> 01:18:38,266
Let me sit there.

952
01:18:44,082 --> 01:18:46,778
God, it's going around, the whole place.

953
01:18:47,885 --> 01:18:51,082
It's like that restaurant
we had on the train

954
01:18:54,258 --> 01:18:56,385
with that funny fat man.

955
01:19:05,770 --> 01:19:09,262
Marcello, will you give me
a proof of your friendship?

956
01:19:10,608 --> 01:19:13,771
There's something to be sent. A letter.

957
01:19:14,779 --> 01:19:18,681
To Rome. To a comrade.
I ask you to help me.

958
01:19:19,650 --> 01:19:22,380
It has to be delivered personally.
There's no hurry.

959
01:19:22,487 --> 01:19:24,717
When you get back to Italy
from our place.

960
01:19:24,822 --> 01:19:26,687
This might mean prison.

961
01:19:26,791 --> 01:19:28,952
Any one of my men
would risk much more.

962
01:19:29,060 --> 01:19:31,153
Professor, one would say
you're doing this purposely,

963
01:19:31,262 --> 01:19:33,662
just to get me into trouble there.

964
01:19:34,565 --> 01:19:36,760
Considering what you're
going back to, Clerici,

965
01:19:36,868 --> 01:19:40,235
- a month in a Fascist jail may be better.
- Excuse me.

966
01:19:54,452 --> 01:19:55,783
What is it?

967
01:19:57,522 --> 01:19:59,149
What's the matter?

968
01:20:00,958 --> 01:20:02,892
Hey, <i>Dottore!</i> Watch out!

969
01:20:04,629 --> 01:20:08,065
What? I'm here to protect you
and you want to kill me?

970
01:20:09,033 --> 01:20:13,265
I don't want to kill anyone. Here.
I don't want to carry it anymore.

971
01:20:15,406 --> 01:20:17,271
What is this all about?

972
01:20:18,476 --> 01:20:21,968
- You giving up?
- No, it's so clumsy.

973
01:20:23,381 --> 01:20:27,112
I don't even know how to use it.
It's in my way, it's so heavy.

974
01:20:33,758 --> 01:20:37,353
Listen to me, comrade!

975
01:20:38,162 --> 01:20:40,630
I want you to look straight at me.

976
01:20:40,998 --> 01:20:44,559
We're in a war, right?
You give up, you're a deserter.

977
01:20:47,471 --> 01:20:50,304
Everybody's thought
of deserting at least once.

978
01:20:50,408 --> 01:20:54,208
- I wouldn't think of that.
- Even I did. Really. Yes, yes, yes.

979
01:20:54,845 --> 01:20:59,145
But I said to myself, "Manganiello,
why, what are you thinking of?"

980
01:20:59,250 --> 01:21:01,241
It isn't your patriotism,

981
01:21:01,452 --> 01:21:04,080
it isn't your honor you are betraying.

982
01:21:04,822 --> 01:21:06,414
It is really you.

983
01:21:07,658 --> 01:21:09,216
After a while,

984
01:21:10,094 --> 01:21:13,621
I managed a hearty pat on my back,
smoked another cigar,

985
01:21:14,031 --> 01:21:17,489
and what did I think? "Let's go.

986
01:21:18,836 --> 01:21:20,360
"Courage now.

987
01:21:21,906 --> 01:21:23,806
"Comrade Manganiello?"

988
01:21:24,642 --> 01:21:26,337
Fight or be beaten.

989
01:21:27,578 --> 01:21:29,045
It's freezing!

990
01:21:29,747 --> 01:21:31,874
Hurry. We're going to dance.

991
01:21:32,650 --> 01:21:34,413
You'll make me fall!

992
01:22:13,991 --> 01:22:15,185
Come on.

993
01:22:23,734 --> 01:22:24,826
Thanks.

994
01:22:24,935 --> 01:22:26,334
If you were what you say,

995
01:22:26,437 --> 01:22:28,735
you would have agreed
to carry that letter

996
01:22:28,839 --> 01:22:32,275
and you would have used it
against our friends in Rome.

997
01:22:39,216 --> 01:22:42,185
Well, take a look.
There's nothing written.

998
01:22:43,754 --> 01:22:46,587
I thought it best to put you to the test.

999
01:23:21,592 --> 01:23:23,719
They must stop dancing.

1000
01:23:24,128 --> 01:23:25,322
But why?

1001
01:23:26,964 --> 01:23:28,829
They're both so pretty.

1002
01:23:45,149 --> 01:23:47,515
Well, what's there to stare at?

1003
01:23:47,618 --> 01:23:52,214
This is Paris,
and I'm a fashionable woman, aren't I?

1004
01:23:52,323 --> 01:23:55,417
- You're crazy, completely.
- All right. Let's dance!

1005
01:23:55,526 --> 01:23:57,858
Everyone! All of you!

1006
01:23:58,496 --> 01:24:02,398
Everybody, come on!

1007
01:25:07,565 --> 01:25:10,033
- Tomorrow by car at dawn.
- Wait!

1008
01:25:10,134 --> 01:25:12,694
- What about his wife?
- She doesn't go.

1009
01:25:13,871 --> 01:25:15,566
Better without her.

1010
01:25:16,073 --> 01:25:17,768
We'll meet in Rome!

1011
01:25:18,609 --> 01:25:20,702
And the best of luck to you!

1012
01:26:23,974 --> 01:26:27,273
Who knows what
you think of me, Professor?

1013
01:26:27,378 --> 01:26:29,471
I've had too much champagne!

1014
01:26:31,348 --> 01:26:33,873
It's good for anybody
to get drunk once in a while.

1015
01:26:33,984 --> 01:26:35,679
You won't believe this.

1016
01:26:35,786 --> 01:26:38,482
You upset me like
you're giving me an exam.

1017
01:26:38,589 --> 01:26:41,387
If you're prepared, everybody'll pass?

1018
01:26:54,405 --> 01:26:58,000
Listen. I'll be going tomorrow
with my husband.

1019
01:26:58,842 --> 01:27:00,400
You must remain.

1020
01:27:05,382 --> 01:27:07,873
Please remain in town. Do it for me.

1021
01:27:08,152 --> 01:27:10,245
Didn't you decide to go
with Giulia and me?

1022
01:27:10,354 --> 01:27:13,289
Haven't you observed
she can't stand me, your Giulia?

1023
01:27:13,824 --> 01:27:14,848
Pardon!

1024
01:27:14,959 --> 01:27:17,587
But Giulia's so stupid.
Can't you see she's drunk?

1025
01:27:17,695 --> 01:27:20,061
We've all lost our heads a little tonight.

1026
01:27:20,164 --> 01:27:23,258
Besides, you're mistaken
to say she can't bear you.

1027
01:27:23,367 --> 01:27:26,734
She mentioned that she admires you.

1028
01:27:28,606 --> 01:27:33,737
- What else did she say?
- That she finds you seductive.

1029
01:27:35,579 --> 01:27:37,206
I changed my mind.

1030
01:27:38,515 --> 01:27:43,817
I'll stay with you in Paris. Glad?

1031
01:27:44,221 --> 01:27:47,156
Anna! The Professor
is propositioning me!

1032
01:27:47,458 --> 01:27:48,652
Help!

1033
01:27:48,759 --> 01:27:53,287
I feel so happy that in a minute
I know I'm going to feel terrible!

1034
01:27:53,864 --> 01:27:55,126
<i>Ciao!</i>

1035
01:28:20,090 --> 01:28:24,151
Damn. I'm beginning to get tired.

1036
01:28:39,510 --> 01:28:41,637
- Manganiello.
- Yes, <i>Dottore.</i>

1037
01:28:42,813 --> 01:28:45,611
- I've just had a fantastic dream.
- You did?

1038
01:28:46,183 --> 01:28:47,980
I was in Switzerland.

1039
01:28:48,085 --> 01:28:50,315
And you were taking me
for an operation in a hospital

1040
01:28:50,421 --> 01:28:51,615
because I was blind.

1041
01:28:51,722 --> 01:28:53,849
Switzerland. It's beautiful.

1042
01:28:54,158 --> 01:28:56,490
And Professor Quadri did the operation.

1043
01:28:57,027 --> 01:29:00,485
The operation was a success
and I was leaving soon

1044
01:29:01,198 --> 01:29:04,361
with the wife of the Professor.
And she loved me.

1045
01:29:08,672 --> 01:29:10,071
Switzerland.

1046
01:29:10,441 --> 01:29:12,306
I remember in Milan

1047
01:29:12,409 --> 01:29:14,707
when I was a child,
we used to sing a song.

1048
01:29:14,812 --> 01:29:16,143
Wait a minute.

1049
01:29:39,937 --> 01:29:42,201
In Africa after all that work
and four dead men,

1050
01:29:42,306 --> 01:29:45,002
we discovered
it was no longer necessary.

1051
01:29:45,709 --> 01:29:49,372
And my superior,
"You have ruined us all!

1052
01:29:49,480 --> 01:29:51,573
"You're only beasts, you are!"

1053
01:29:51,682 --> 01:29:55,118
"Now wait a second," I said.
"We are men, not beasts."

1054
01:30:00,724 --> 01:30:02,624
That woman should have
returned to her bed

1055
01:30:02,726 --> 01:30:04,694
and stayed there all day.

1056
01:30:08,031 --> 01:30:09,328
God!

1057
01:30:09,433 --> 01:30:12,698
- Love can certainly...
- What are you trying to say?

1058
01:30:14,805 --> 01:30:16,773
No. Nothing, <i>Dottore.</i>

1059
01:30:17,341 --> 01:30:21,368
No. I was saying that sometimes
love can even perform miracles.

1060
01:30:32,956 --> 01:30:34,082
There!

1061
01:30:36,293 --> 01:30:38,056
It's them, isn't it?

1062
01:30:39,763 --> 01:30:41,731
Keep about 60 feet back.

1063
01:30:58,949 --> 01:31:00,211
There's a car behind us.

1064
01:31:00,317 --> 01:31:01,682
- So?
- Following us.

1065
01:31:01,785 --> 01:31:04,720
Nothing the matter with that.
Why are you so nervous?

1066
01:31:15,732 --> 01:31:17,029
Watch out!

1067
01:31:32,216 --> 01:31:34,411
Must be something the matter.

1068
01:31:34,518 --> 01:31:36,645
Don't get out, please, I beg you!

1069
01:31:36,753 --> 01:31:39,950
- Well, why not?
- I don't know, but I'm frightened.

1070
01:32:27,170 --> 01:32:29,604
We can't just sit here like this.

1071
01:32:29,706 --> 01:32:31,435
I'll be right back.

1072
01:32:32,409 --> 01:32:33,706
Wait here.

1073
01:32:36,380 --> 01:32:37,438
Luca!

1074
01:33:21,591 --> 01:33:23,286
I thought you were ill.

1075
01:33:23,393 --> 01:33:25,987
What is it? What do you want from me?

1076
01:34:58,288 --> 01:35:00,153
Look out, I'm shooting.

1077
01:35:36,893 --> 01:35:39,828
How disgusting. I've always said so.

1078
01:35:39,930 --> 01:35:43,661
Make me work in the shit,
sure, but not with a coward.

1079
01:35:43,767 --> 01:35:46,429
If it's up to me, cowards,
homosexuals and Jews,

1080
01:35:46,536 --> 01:35:47,935
they're all the same thing.

1081
01:35:49,673 --> 01:35:53,109
If it were up to me,
I'd stand them all against a wall.

1082
01:35:56,580 --> 01:36:01,108
Better yet,
eliminate them when they're born.

1083
01:37:38,114 --> 01:37:39,411
<i>Attention.</i>

1084
01:37:41,418 --> 01:37:42,817
<i>Attention.</i>

1085
01:37:44,287 --> 01:37:47,984
<i>His Majesty King Vittorio Emanuele</i>

1086
01:37:48,091 --> 01:37:52,858
<i>accepted the resignation</i>
<i>of His Excellency Benito Mussolini</i>

1087
01:37:53,196 --> 01:37:57,189

1088
01:37:57,734 --> 01:37:59,497

1089
01:37:59,603 --> 01:38:02,003
<i>Prime Minister and Secretary of State,</i>

1090
01:38:02,105 --> 01:38:06,508
<i>His Excellency Marshal Pietro Badoglio.</i>

1091
01:38:18,989 --> 01:38:22,117
How elegant you are
with your mama's hat on!

1092
01:38:25,962 --> 01:38:28,487
You even put on the foxes
Mama brought from Paris.

1093
01:38:28,598 --> 01:38:29,997
Good for Marta!

1094
01:38:30,100 --> 01:38:33,558
<i>King Vittorio Emanuele has</i>
<i>accepted the resignation</i>

1095
01:38:33,670 --> 01:38:37,367
<i>of His Excellency Benito Mussolini</i>

1096
01:38:37,774 --> 01:38:41,801

1097
01:38:42,345 --> 01:38:44,813

1098
01:38:44,914 --> 01:38:47,849
<i>Prime minister and Secretary of State,</i>

1099
01:38:47,951 --> 01:38:51,250
<i>His Excellency Marshal Pietro Badoglio.</i>

1100
01:39:16,846 --> 01:39:18,507
A red apple.

1101
01:39:22,118 --> 01:39:25,417
Ready? Hail Mary, full of grace...

1102
01:39:25,522 --> 01:39:27,615
"Hail Mary, full of grace..."

1103
01:39:27,724 --> 01:39:30,784
- the Lord is with Thee.
- "the Lord is with Thee."

1104
01:39:30,894 --> 01:39:35,524
- Blessed art Thou amongst women...
- "Blessed art Thou amongst women..."

1105
01:39:36,232 --> 01:39:39,395
...and blessed is the fruit
of Thy womb, Jesus.

1106
01:39:41,004 --> 01:39:43,472
"...the fruit of Thy womb, Jesus."

1107
01:39:44,541 --> 01:39:46,634
Holy Mary, Mother of God...

1108
01:39:47,744 --> 01:39:49,974
"Holy Mary, Mother of God..."

1109
01:39:50,080 --> 01:39:52,605
...pray for us sinners...

1110
01:39:52,716 --> 01:39:54,877
"...pray for us sinners..."

1111
01:39:54,984 --> 01:39:59,648
...now and at the hour of our death.
- "...now and at the hour of our death."

1112
01:39:59,756 --> 01:40:00,984
Italo called.

1113
01:40:01,091 --> 01:40:03,423
- Amen.
- "Amen."

1114
01:40:05,128 --> 01:40:08,120
Now to sleep.
Come on, lie down and sleep.

1115
01:40:12,302 --> 01:40:15,703
- Italo?
- Yes. Italo.

1116
01:40:20,377 --> 01:40:24,006
- What did he want?
- He'll expect you at the usual place.

1117
01:40:27,650 --> 01:40:30,448
<i>Italo. After all this time.</i>

1118
01:40:38,461 --> 01:40:40,452
How awful they all are!

1119
01:40:41,131 --> 01:40:43,759
Celebrating because
the King threw out Mussolini,

1120
01:40:43,867 --> 01:40:46,358
when yesterday they were all for him.

1121
01:40:46,469 --> 01:40:48,699
I can't wait till we get them out of here.

1122
01:40:48,805 --> 01:40:51,330
Why see Italo? What's the use of it?

1123
01:40:52,175 --> 01:40:55,338
If he called it means he needs me,
and I'm going.

1124
01:40:57,247 --> 01:40:59,977
I was always the one
who took him around.

1125
01:41:00,583 --> 01:41:02,414
I took him everywhere.

1126
01:41:03,686 --> 01:41:06,655
He used to say that
when I described things to him

1127
01:41:06,756 --> 01:41:09,520
it was like seeing them
with his own eyes.

1128
01:41:10,660 --> 01:41:12,059
Go to sleep.

1129
01:41:14,063 --> 01:41:15,792
Marcello, you've got to take care,
you hear?

1130
01:41:15,899 --> 01:41:16,923
Why?

1131
01:41:17,867 --> 01:41:19,459
What do you mean?

1132
01:41:21,805 --> 01:41:22,999
Nothing.

1133
01:41:26,409 --> 01:41:29,901
Wait, listen.
What are you going to do now?

1134
01:41:30,013 --> 01:41:32,811
The same as everyone else
who thought like me.

1135
01:41:34,851 --> 01:41:37,285
When there are so many of us,
there's no risk.

1136
01:41:37,387 --> 01:41:40,720
I know, but I want to say
the business with Quadri...

1137
01:41:53,336 --> 01:41:56,032
I don't know what you're talking about.

1138
01:41:59,309 --> 01:42:01,402
In Paris, Anna,

1139
01:42:02,745 --> 01:42:05,441
maybe in order
to get me away from you,

1140
01:42:05,982 --> 01:42:08,678
told me you worked
for the secret police.

1141
01:42:11,054 --> 01:42:14,888
- And you? What did you answer?
- That it wasn't important.

1142
01:42:15,258 --> 01:42:17,852
That I was your wife and I loved you.

1143
01:42:19,095 --> 01:42:22,258
And if you worked for them,
it was your decision.

1144
01:42:26,169 --> 01:42:30,367
But then, when the Quadris were killed,

1145
01:42:30,473 --> 01:42:34,000
how scared I became.

1146
01:42:42,018 --> 01:42:44,316
And what do you think of it now?

1147
01:42:49,225 --> 01:42:51,557
Well, I think that, after all,

1148
01:42:54,230 --> 01:42:56,960
it was an important step in your career.

1149
01:42:57,867 --> 01:42:59,300
That's right.

1150
01:43:02,205 --> 01:43:04,070
Marcello, don't go out!

1151
01:43:08,645 --> 01:43:10,408
They could hurt you.

1152
01:43:10,613 --> 01:43:12,513
I won't be in danger.

1153
01:43:13,683 --> 01:43:16,311
After all, what have I done? My duty.

1154
01:43:16,986 --> 01:43:18,977
But why do you want to go?

1155
01:43:20,890 --> 01:43:23,620
I want to see how a dictatorship falls.

1156
01:43:36,105 --> 01:43:39,563
Mama! Where are you? I'm afraid.

1157
01:43:41,678 --> 01:43:43,873
I'm here, darling. I'm coming.

1158
01:44:01,164 --> 01:44:02,392
Marcello?

1159
01:44:08,104 --> 01:44:11,005
There's something
that's still stuck to you.

1160
01:44:12,542 --> 01:44:14,442
- Where?
- Here.

1161
01:44:15,445 --> 01:44:16,673
Oh, yes.

1162
01:44:57,153 --> 01:44:58,518
What about eating?

1163
01:44:58,621 --> 01:45:01,146
As long as there are cats around,
I manage.

1164
01:45:01,257 --> 01:45:03,919
They say cat meat tastes like rabbit.

1165
01:45:04,027 --> 01:45:05,961
Too bad we didn't meet yesterday.

1166
01:45:06,062 --> 01:45:08,121
I had a whipped cream cake at home.

1167
01:45:08,231 --> 01:45:10,358
- With real cream?
- Yes, why not?

1168
01:45:10,466 --> 01:45:13,026
- You need eggs for that.
- Somebody I met lives in the country.

1169
01:45:13,136 --> 01:45:14,728
He sends me bread, too.

1170
01:45:14,837 --> 01:45:17,101
Fresh eggs? Bread?

1171
01:45:17,206 --> 01:45:20,073
He keeps me supplied.
I never lack for anything in my house.

1172
01:45:20,176 --> 01:45:22,542
Chickens, butter, fresh cheese.

1173
01:45:22,645 --> 01:45:25,273
- And potatoes?
- Potatoes, too.

1174
01:45:25,381 --> 01:45:27,872
If you come home with me,
I'll be happy to make you an omelet.

1175
01:45:27,984 --> 01:45:30,077
- What kind?
- A jelly omelet.

1176
01:45:30,520 --> 01:45:32,283
You must be tired
of eating cats all the time.

1177
01:45:32,388 --> 01:45:35,983
Yes. I ate too many of them.
And they're not so easy to find.

1178
01:45:36,092 --> 01:45:38,822
- What did you do?
- Ate mice.

1179
01:45:38,928 --> 01:45:40,589
There are more rats with the cats gone?

1180
01:45:40,697 --> 01:45:42,665
Yes, but they're all skin and bones.

1181
01:45:42,765 --> 01:45:44,164
Listen. I don't live far from here.

1182
01:45:44,267 --> 01:45:46,861
Why don't you come
and have dinner with me?

1183
01:45:47,303 --> 01:45:49,430
- Is there a place to sleep?
- You can stay.

1184
01:45:49,539 --> 01:45:52,531
Nice shoes you have. Soft.

1185
01:45:52,909 --> 01:45:54,240
They were a present.

1186
01:45:54,343 --> 01:45:56,971
I got a present, too. A Siamese cat.

1187
01:45:57,080 --> 01:45:59,048
- Was he good?
- Too tough.

1188
01:45:59,982 --> 01:46:02,542
I have a pair of suede shoes.
You can have them.

1189
01:46:02,652 --> 01:46:06,383
And I have a nice oriental kimono.
Like Madame Butterfly's.

1190
01:46:06,522 --> 01:46:08,251
You know who Madame Butterfly is?

1191
01:46:08,357 --> 01:46:09,415
Lino!

1192
01:46:10,259 --> 01:46:14,457
- Is your name Lino? You!
- Me? Why?

1193
01:46:15,732 --> 01:46:18,360
You were a chauffeur, right?

1194
01:46:18,868 --> 01:46:22,463
- But a long time ago.
- Yes.

1195
01:46:27,076 --> 01:46:31,911
- You had a pistol.
- I? I don't understand you.

1196
01:46:33,449 --> 01:46:35,314
And you're alive still.

1197
01:46:35,952 --> 01:46:38,352
But I don't know you.
What do you want of me?

1198
01:46:38,454 --> 01:46:40,081
What's that scar?

1199
01:46:40,857 --> 01:46:42,950
- There was an accident.
- What accident?

1200
01:46:43,059 --> 01:46:44,583
What do you want?
Take your hands off me!

1201
01:46:44,694 --> 01:46:45,956
Where were you?

1202
01:46:46,062 --> 01:46:48,656
What were you doing
on March 25, 1917?

1203
01:46:49,098 --> 01:46:51,532
Me? I... Who are you?
You must be crazy.

1204
01:46:51,634 --> 01:46:54,432
What were you doing
on March 25, 1917?

1205
01:46:54,537 --> 01:46:55,936
Let me alone!

1206
01:46:56,038 --> 01:46:58,199
And the 15th of October, 1938.

1207
01:46:58,307 --> 01:47:00,434
Where were you?
What were you doing?

1208
01:47:01,244 --> 01:47:05,510
What were you doing at 4:00 p.m.
on October 15th, 1938?

1209
01:47:05,615 --> 01:47:07,606
Where were you?
What were you doing?

1210
01:47:07,717 --> 01:47:11,153
What were you doing? I've got to know.

1211
01:47:12,722 --> 01:47:15,953
Murderer! Murderer!

1212
01:47:18,094 --> 01:47:21,860
He killed a man, a political exile,

1213
01:47:22,698 --> 01:47:25,690
on October 15th, 1938!

1214
01:47:26,068 --> 01:47:27,933
Yes, Professor Quadri!

1215
01:47:28,271 --> 01:47:29,670
Luca Quadri!

1216
01:47:30,439 --> 01:47:33,169
And his wife Anna Quadri.

1217
01:47:36,546 --> 01:47:39,572
He's a homosexual, a Fascist!

1218
01:47:40,249 --> 01:47:42,342
And his name is Pasqualino!

1219
01:47:44,053 --> 01:47:45,384
Semirama!

1220
01:47:46,289 --> 01:47:48,348
Pasqualino Semirama!

1221
01:47:48,624 --> 01:47:52,890
Marcello, don't do that.

1222
01:47:55,865 --> 01:47:57,833
Marcello, where are you?

1223
01:47:59,101 --> 01:48:01,467
- Fascist!
- No, Marcello!

1224
01:48:01,571 --> 01:48:04,699
He, too, is a Fascist. Right here.

1225
01:48:04,807 --> 01:48:06,672
- What are you doing this for?
- This one's a Fascist.

1226
01:48:06,776 --> 01:48:10,542
Marcello, no. No, Marcello, please.

1227
01:48:10,646 --> 01:48:12,705
Marcello, no, no, Marcello!

1228
01:48:13,749 --> 01:48:16,775
Italo Montanari! Fascist!

1229
01:48:16,886 --> 01:48:18,717
No, Marcello. Are you crazy?

1230
01:48:18,821 --> 01:48:22,518
Marcello, why are you doing this?
Please, come back here.

1231
01:48:24,460 --> 01:48:27,293
Marcello. Marcello!

1232
01:48:28,731 --> 01:48:31,996
Marcello! Marcello!
