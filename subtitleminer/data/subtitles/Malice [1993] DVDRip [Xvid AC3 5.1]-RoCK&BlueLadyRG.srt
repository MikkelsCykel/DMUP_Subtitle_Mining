1
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:10,669
Little Ricky, where are you baby?
Come on honey... it's dinner time.

2
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,834
It's your favourite flavour - Liver.
Where are you?

3
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:22,188
There you are. Hey.. what're you doing under there?

4
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,718
What you doing under there?
What's the matter?

5
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:35,354
Oh..Ricky baby, what's the matter sweetheart?

6
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,798
We're ready for you doctor.

7
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:08,069
How is she?
- Still in the O.T. I haven't heard anything yet.

8
00:04:08,241 --> 00:04:12,951
When did this happen?
- He was waiting for her at her place when she got home from class.

9
00:04:13,121 --> 00:04:16,397
Forensics say it was the same man
who raped Cara Latham.

10
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,949
Did you really need a forensics expert to tell you that?

11
00:04:19,121 --> 00:04:23,831
Andy.
Dana, when was the last time I asked your department to
beef up the security and cameras, right?

12
00:04:24,001 --> 00:04:27,073
I mean not the first four times. It's the last time.

13
00:04:27,241 --> 00:04:31,250
Don't get pissy with me professor.
I don't have the manpower to break up a fraternity party.

14
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:32,800
Suction
- Suction.

15
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:33,800
What's that pressure?

16
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,700
Less than 70. Sixty-nine.
She's sliding down pretty fast.

17
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:39,900
We're gonna lose her doctor.
- I would not bet my ranch on that.

18
00:04:40,241 --> 00:04:42,100
David, drop 0.2 ccs of epinephrine.

19
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,950
Tanya, give me the stitch please.
- 3, 0 silk.

20
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:48,078
We've gone at 63. Epinephrine doctor ?
- No, Not yet.

21
00:04:52,081 --> 00:04:53,434
60.

22
00:04:54,521 --> 00:04:57,957
Still think it's a phenobarbital reaction?

23
00:05:00,121 --> 00:05:01,713
Epinephrine.

24
00:05:03,241 --> 00:05:06,517
And..
- At ease up on retraction pressure.

25
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:10,151
65 & going up.
- No doubt about that.

26
00:05:10,321 --> 00:05:12,198
68.
- I don't believe that.

27
00:05:12,362 --> 00:05:15,160
72.
- How about your scissors?

28
00:05:15,322 --> 00:05:16,960
Metzenbaum.
- Beautiful.

29
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:20,313
80.
- She's out of the woods.

30
00:05:22,401 --> 00:05:25,040
Great to practice medicine.
Irrigation please.

31
00:05:25,201 --> 00:05:28,989
Dr. Robertson, would you please close the wound for me?
Nice going, people.

32
00:05:31,842 --> 00:05:34,072
By the way, everybody:

33
00:05:34,242 --> 00:05:37,393
it's great to be in Saint Agnes.

34
00:05:41,602 --> 00:05:43,240
That was good work.

35
00:05:45,202 --> 00:05:47,670
Dr. Robertson...
May I call you Matthew ?
- Of course.

36
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,150
Matthew....

37
00:05:51,282 --> 00:05:54,831
I'm the new guy around here and I want to make friends, so ....

38
00:05:55,002 --> 00:05:58,711
I'll say this to you and we'll start fresh.

39
00:06:00,681 --> 00:06:04,469
If you don't like my jokes, don't laugh.

40
00:06:04,642 --> 00:06:09,432
If you have a medical opinion, then please
speak up and speak up loud.

41
00:06:09,682 --> 00:06:14,198
But if you ever again tell me or my surgical
staff that we're going to lose a patient,

42
00:06:14,362 --> 00:06:18,594
...I'm going to take out your lungs
with a fuckin' ice cream scoop.

43
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:21,715
Do you understand me?

44
00:06:23,283 --> 00:06:25,353
I'm not gonna like you, am I?

45
00:06:25,522 --> 00:06:29,879
Don't be ridiculous.
Everybody likes me.

46
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,655
Dr. Hill !
- Ya.

47
00:06:39,962 --> 00:06:43,030
I'm Andy Safian.
I'm Associate Dean at the college & I wondered..

48
00:06:43,082 --> 00:06:46,279
if you could tell me anything about Bridget Kelly's condition.

49
00:06:46,443 --> 00:06:51,312
Well, she has a badly bruised liver but I
think she's gonna be just fine.

50
00:06:51,482 --> 00:06:53,677
Great. Thanks to you.

51
00:06:53,842 --> 00:06:58,597
Well, come to the midnight show, I love
to take the next of kin.

52
00:07:01,243 --> 00:07:02,500
It's Jed Hill, right?

53
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,800
"Galloping" Jed Hill?

54
00:07:07,851 --> 00:07:08,620
Excuse me.

55
00:07:09,123 --> 00:07:11,717
We were at the high school together.

56
00:07:11,882 --> 00:07:14,890
You're kidding me.
You went to Van Buren?

57
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:16,410
Yeah.
- Wow!

58
00:07:16,802 --> 00:07:20,885
How long you've been in Westerly?
- Well, I've been here about nine hours now. Van Buren, huh?

59
00:07:21,285 --> 00:07:25,242
Yeah, well, we weren't in the same... we didn't travel
in the same circles but...

60
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:29,520
Did I give you a hard time?
- No, you didn't know who the hell I was. So..

61
00:07:31,292 --> 00:07:32,292
Dr. Hill...

62
00:07:34,069 --> 00:07:34,840
Hi Tanya!

63
00:07:35,603 --> 00:07:39,755
I just wanted to say congratulations.
We're all very happy that you're here.

64
00:07:39,923 --> 00:07:43,074
Well, thank you. It's..
it's nice to be here.

65
00:07:47,603 --> 00:07:50,276
Looks like you're again the popular man.

66
00:07:51,443 --> 00:07:55,880
I hope to see you around.
- Yeah, me too.

67
00:08:01,924 --> 00:08:03,596
Oh, that's wonderful, Michelle.

68
00:08:04,683 --> 00:08:08,801
Hey, why don't we try painting on a paper
& not on your arm?

69
00:08:08,963 --> 00:08:12,353
I am a monster.
- Teacher, teacher...

70
00:08:13,523 --> 00:08:16,276
Hey, don't you ever play with plastic bags or

71
00:08:16,443 --> 00:08:19,833
I'll tie you up and I'll feed you to little cape
monster, you got it?

72
00:08:28,724 --> 00:08:32,194
I heard what happened.
- Can you come on lunch now?

73
00:08:32,364 --> 00:08:33,956
in a minute.

74
00:08:39,123 --> 00:08:43,435
Yeah, the guy got in when she was
at her class.

75
00:08:43,603 --> 00:08:45,300
She's gonna be alright.
- Looks like it...

76
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:51,038
turns out that the hospital has a new surgeon,
this whizkid from Mass General did a great job.

77
00:08:51,203 --> 00:08:55,754
So I went back to introduce myself, to thank him
& are you ready for this?

78
00:08:56,844 --> 00:08:59,677
We were at the High School together.
- Oh, no kidding.

79
00:09:01,884 --> 00:09:04,796
Speak of the Devil...
- And the Devil appears.

80
00:09:04,964 --> 00:09:07,797
I was just recounting all your experts' here.

81
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:11,320
This is my wife, Tracy.
Tracy, this is Dr. Jed Hill.

82
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:13,395
A school friend of Andy.

83
00:09:13,564 --> 00:09:17,477
This is Dr. Sullivan, Alan and Tracy Safian.
- Andy.

84
00:09:17,644 --> 00:09:20,556
Andy works at the college.
- He's Associate Dean, Mr. Hill.

85
00:09:20,723 --> 00:09:23,760
Fantastic.
- I don't leap tall buildings in a single bound.

86
00:09:23,924 --> 00:09:26,484
But we are very proud of him.
- That's well. You should be.

87
00:09:26,644 --> 00:09:30,876
Listen, we're having a small reception to welcome Jed
to Saint Agnes. Why don't you come along?

88
00:09:31,044 --> 00:09:34,434
Oh, we'll have to go. We have a lunch appointment.
- Oh, maybe some other time.

89
00:09:34,604 --> 00:09:36,560
Definitely.

90
00:09:36,724 --> 00:09:39,841
Nice meeting you, Tracy.
- Yeah, nice to meet you.

91
00:09:44,764 --> 00:09:47,642
Well, we got the estimate from the plumber this morning.
- And?

92
00:09:49,244 --> 00:09:51,700
Are you ready for this?
- How much?

93
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,594
It's... 13,000 and change.
- How much change?

94
00:09:57,765 --> 00:10:01,997
It's 14,000.
- Alright, forget it. I'm gonna do the work myself.

95
00:10:02,164 --> 00:10:03,882
I got a better idea.
- No.

96
00:10:04,045 --> 00:10:07,037
Well, just for a little while. It pays and goes,
we rent it to some visiting lecturer.

97
00:10:07,204 --> 00:10:10,833
I don't want to rent out the third floor.
I don't want a stranger in our house.

98
00:10:11,005 --> 00:10:13,314
Alright, suit yourself.

99
00:10:13,485 --> 00:10:17,000
Would've been nice living in
a home with running water but...

100
00:10:17,164 --> 00:10:18,961
I'm a simple girl.

101
00:10:21,325 --> 00:10:24,397
Hey, I'm gonna pick you up after work.
- No, it's okay.

102
00:10:24,565 --> 00:10:27,602
Forget it. I'm gonna pick you up.
There's a maniac who's in this town.

103
00:10:27,764 --> 00:10:31,677
Helen can give me a ride.
- She can? Are you sure?

104
00:10:35,244 --> 00:10:37,963
Make sure she waits until you're inside the house.

105
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:41,481
I'll have her provide air coverage if you want.

106
00:10:44,245 --> 00:10:47,760
It's funny. I married a funny woman.

107
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,150
See ya.
- Nice.

108
00:11:33,766 --> 00:11:38,317
You know in street clothes,
Helen looks positively masculine.
- What?

109
00:11:38,486 --> 00:11:42,923
Helen. You said you were getting a
ride home from Helen.

110
00:11:43,086 --> 00:11:47,045
Were you spying on me ?
- No, no. Looking out my window.

111
00:11:47,205 --> 00:11:52,233
Then you were looking at Dennis Riley, my mother's
lawyer. He had papers for me to sign.

112
00:11:52,406 --> 00:11:54,715
What kind of papers?

113
00:11:54,886 --> 00:11:56,900
Something about my mother's estate.
What is this?

114
00:11:57,225 --> 00:11:59,120
Your mother's estate?
- Yes.

115
00:11:59,205 --> 00:12:02,117
You told me she barely got by in
her social welfare check (made her living).

116
00:12:02,286 --> 00:12:05,915
And now she's Lady Astor?
- Come on, Andy.

117
00:12:07,566 --> 00:12:09,450
There was a small account for the
cemetery arrangements.

118
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,600
The money lacks about which Dennis
wanted to talk to me about.

119
00:12:11,715 --> 00:12:13,340
And now what is it you want to
talk to me about?

120
00:12:15,229 --> 00:12:16,229
Sorry.

121
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:24,203
Hey listen, would you think any less of
me if I use a fork?

122
00:12:24,366 --> 00:12:28,678
I've been losing my strength here.
- I can't let that happen.

123
00:12:28,846 --> 00:12:30,757
Lie back. Give it to me.

124
00:12:31,806 --> 00:12:36,561
Lie back. That's right.
All the way back.

125
00:12:36,726 --> 00:12:40,036
Technique, huh?
- The expert.

126
00:12:40,206 --> 00:12:44,722
It's all in my hands, see?
Open. Open up.

127
00:12:46,126 --> 00:12:48,640
Good boy.
Delicious, huh?

128
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:58,357
Delicious. More...

129
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:01,360
Look, I think your strength
is returning.

130
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:04,318
It's a miracle.

131
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,800
Andy.

132
00:13:31,206 --> 00:13:33,515
What is it?
- He's there again.

133
00:13:35,086 --> 00:13:38,362
So?
- He's looking at us.

134
00:13:38,527 --> 00:13:45,126
Sounds like he's playing one of those electric keyboards.
- Jesus, it gives me the creeps.

135
00:13:45,287 --> 00:13:49,280
Be nice.
His mother works as a night nurse.

136
00:13:49,447 --> 00:13:51,961
Probably he is lonely.

137
00:13:58,567 --> 00:14:03,197
We gotta get some curtains up here.
It's a priority.

138
00:14:05,127 --> 00:14:10,326
Curtains are now the priority.
- Not until we decide what to paint.

139
00:14:11,407 --> 00:14:17,004
There is no point in painting if we
are going to break the house for the plumbing.

140
00:14:17,167 --> 00:14:21,046
So we are back to where we started.

141
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:51,100
Oh Jeez !....

142
00:14:52,327 --> 00:14:53,800
Front door was wide open.
- Oh...

143
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,400
You scared the hell out of me.

144
00:14:56,967 --> 00:14:58,958
I should have knocked but...
- Oh, no, no.

145
00:15:01,207 --> 00:15:05,439
Yeah... I have been working with a liquid paint remover.
Sometimes I get a headache from these odors.

146
00:15:05,607 --> 00:15:08,075
Oh, you should be taking a B Complex.
- Say again ?

147
00:15:08,248 --> 00:15:11,877
Well, a loading dose of a B-12
would help to enhance the cerebral cap....

148
00:15:12,927 --> 00:15:15,760
Never mind.
- No, no. why did you stop? That sounded great.

149
00:15:15,927 --> 00:15:20,159
Well, no it just occurred to me that I was suggesting you take a jar
of vitamins, you'd be smart not to leave the door open.

150
00:15:20,328 --> 00:15:23,126
Look at that. I saved myself $ 5.95.

151
00:15:23,288 --> 00:15:28,965
I was in the neighbourhood looking at some houses
and I thought I would take you and your wife out
for the lunch as promised.

152
00:15:29,127 --> 00:15:33,564
Well, Tracy is out to her class but I can get
cleaned up and we could go out ourselves.

153
00:15:33,728 --> 00:15:36,447
Sounds good.
- Alright. Okay, I'll be right back.

154
00:15:44,768 --> 00:15:49,364
So this is a real Victorian house, huh?
- Yeah, buried under a hundred years of paint.

155
00:15:49,528 --> 00:15:53,760
It was part of the underground rails
during the civil war.

156
00:15:54,608 --> 00:15:57,100
Lack of comfort makes up for the history.

157
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:03,278
You know anything about architecture? ?
- Architecture...oh architecture is my life.

158
00:16:03,448 --> 00:16:05,200
If I hadn't been a doctor, I'd have been...

159
00:16:06,848 --> 00:16:09,726
... It'd have been a building.
Is this a Degas?

160
00:16:09,888 --> 00:16:13,324
Ya. I think it's original.
Tracy's father gave it to her.

161
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:22,122
She's been having these abdominal pains.

162
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:26,405
How often?
- Maybe once a week or all week days.

163
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:29,640
How long do they last?
- Half a minute, sometimes even longer.

164
00:16:29,808 --> 00:16:35,121
Is she seeing someone?
- Yeah, a doctor in Boston named Lillianfield.

165
00:16:35,288 --> 00:16:40,157
David Lillianfield. Do you know him?
- I've heard of him.  Lillianfield is a good man.

166
00:16:41,409 --> 00:16:45,607
The thing is, we really wanna have kids.
Tracy is nuts about it.

167
00:16:45,768 --> 00:16:48,965
So am I.
- I'll tell you what.

168
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:54,407
Give it another couple of weeks and if there
is no change, have a come by and see me.

169
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,500
Alright.

170
00:16:55,827 --> 00:16:57,150
Hey Stanley...

171
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:00,438
Hey Doc, it hurts when I do this.

172
00:17:00,608 --> 00:17:03,805
Then don't do that. And get some
new jokes, Stanley.

173
00:17:05,088 --> 00:17:10,401
So I told him 'why don't you come by and
look at ours and maybe we'd work out.'

174
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:13,406
You did what?

175
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:16,766
You're the one who wanted to rent it out.
I thought you'd be thrilled.

176
00:17:16,929 --> 00:17:22,083
Do I look thrilled?
- You're not thrilled. I can see that now but..

177
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:25,400
this is better than a visiting lecturer.
Jed is a friend.

178
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:28,845
He's not a friend. He didn't even
remember your name, Alan.

179
00:17:29,009 --> 00:17:32,365
I mean, common the guy had just been
through twelve hours of surgery.

180
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:36,409
What is it Andy? You want to relive the Highschool,
be friends with the quarterback this time?

181
00:17:36,569 --> 00:17:41,085
No, he was the running back.
And stop talking to me like I'm eleven.

182
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:44,845
What's your problem with this guy?
I mean he's smart, he's funny....

183
00:17:45,009 --> 00:17:48,638
... and he's a brilliant doctor.
- I know. I know he's brilliant Andy...

184
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:52,100
I can tell by the way the nurses seem to fall on
their knees when he walks down the hallway.

185
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:55,600
I mean, this guy doesn't have friends,
he has subjects.

186
00:17:56,448 --> 00:17:57,200
Well....

187
00:17:58,209 --> 00:18:01,679
It's not too late, we
can call it off.

188
00:18:01,849 --> 00:18:05,319
No, no. I'm leaving it up to you.

189
00:18:05,489 --> 00:18:10,609
If you want to live with that, it's your decision.
- You're gonna get to like him. You really will.

190
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:12,700
And you know what else?

191
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:16,300
We could even ask him to recommend
another doctor for you.

192
00:18:16,517 --> 00:18:17,720
Hello, what?

193
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:23,528
If for no other reason, then it's nonsense to drive two hours
to see Lillianfield in Boston when we could just easily ...

194
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:28,445
Andy, please tell me you didn't say anything to Jed.
Please tell me you didn't share my problems with him.

195
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:31,721
It came up.

196
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,500
It came up.

197
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:39,729
I apologise.
- Alright.

198
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:41,700
I will go along with this
for a few months ...

199
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,950
Only because I want the sofa...

200
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,200
... combining with the stairs.

201
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:52,879
Oh my God, is he moving in tonight?

202
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:56,725
You're assuming it's Jed?
- Oh, I'm quite certain it's Jed. Open the door.

203
00:18:56,890 --> 00:19:01,168
It could be anyone.
- The angels could dance on pins, but they do not. It's Jed.

204
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:06,686
What makes you so sure?
- You want to bet me?

205
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:08,800
No.

206
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:12,840
Because once money is involved,
you take me seriously, right?

207
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:14,550
Hello.

208
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:17,798
Dr. Hill. Please come in.

209
00:19:19,611 --> 00:19:22,489
Andy just got through telling me,
we're gonna be roommates.

210
00:19:22,651 --> 00:19:26,041
Well, that's why I stopped by.
I just wanted to make sure that it was really okay.

211
00:19:26,211 --> 00:19:29,900
Don't be silly. I'm looking forward to it.
- She is. She is really looking forward to it.

212
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,400
Excellent.

213
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:48,600
The mid-term was at 8:30. I set my alarm for 7
& it didn't go off.

214
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:52,168
I mean if Professor Schmidt wants to give
me an incomplete, then I really don't care.

215
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:56,642
I can't control everything in this world.
My alarm didn't go off.

216
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:59,600
That's good.
That's very good, Paula.

217
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:04,368
That's so much better than locking your copy of
Beowulf in your friend's car.

218
00:20:05,192 --> 00:20:06,000
Thank You.

219
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:08,150
Yeah.

220
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:11,283
Detective Harris wishes to see you.
- Really.

221
00:20:11,451 --> 00:20:13,407
I'm amazed she could find the building.

222
00:20:13,571 --> 00:20:16,802
We'll have to continue this next week if you don't mind.
- Fine.

223
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:24,442
Hang on, Paula. Hi Dana, go on in.
It will be just a second.

224
00:20:24,611 --> 00:20:28,200
Mrs. Worthington, I want you to note all test and
exam times for Ms. Paula Bell.

225
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:32,050
She's to receive wake up calls from this office.
- Wake up calls?

226
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:37,481
She can't be expected to control the world, Mrs. Worthington.
Her alarm didn't go off.

227
00:20:37,651 --> 00:20:39,721
I'll see you next week, Paula.

228
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,850
Sorry.
- Jesus !

229
00:20:46,771 --> 00:20:48,887
She able to give any kind of description ?

230
00:20:49,051 --> 00:20:51,884
All she remembers is her cat crouching
under a chair...

231
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:55,521
... and an arm grabbing her from behind.

232
00:20:55,691 --> 00:20:57,886
Is there any chance she'll remember more?

233
00:20:58,051 --> 00:20:59,200
I don't think so.

234
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:00,450
So...

235
00:21:01,371 --> 00:21:04,443
What do we do now?
- We ?

236
00:21:04,612 --> 00:21:07,968
'We' don't do anything Andy.
Only one of us is a police detective.

237
00:21:08,131 --> 00:21:10,520
Maybe not even that many.

238
00:21:10,692 --> 00:21:13,889
Oh... college wit.
Let me search my mind for a clever answer.

239
00:21:14,051 --> 00:21:16,485
How about 'bite me' ?

240
00:21:16,652 --> 00:21:18,370
Touché.

241
00:21:18,532 --> 00:21:21,092
We have ordered more ''Security Precautions'' pamphlets.

242
00:21:21,252 --> 00:21:23,402
More pamphlets?
- That's right.

243
00:21:23,572 --> 00:21:27,167
Do you know what I see when I come
to work every morning?

244
00:21:28,132 --> 00:21:34,446
I see fathers loading trunks, suitcases, plants
and daughters in their station wagons.

245
00:21:34,611 --> 00:21:39,082
Presumably to drive them off to school so that
they don't pose quite as high a death threat.

246
00:21:39,252 --> 00:21:41,891
See, I don't think I'm being unreasonable
when I ask...

247
00:21:42,052 --> 00:21:44,180
... what you and your crack-team of professionals are doing

248
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,100
other than distributing literature to repress this situation.

249
00:21:48,411 --> 00:21:50,650
I need a list of anyone who had access to
the students' schedules.

250
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,840
Both victims were inside the class
when our guy got in.

251
00:21:55,012 --> 00:21:58,402
So you have narrowed it down to a couple
of thousand people.

252
00:21:58,572 --> 00:22:01,962
A list, Andy.
I need it, now.

253
00:22:03,851 --> 00:22:05,009
Dana...

254
00:22:05,611 --> 00:22:08,500
What do you think he does with the hair?
- The hair ?

255
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:12,363
Yeah, he gets off all the hair.
What do you think he does with it?

256
00:22:12,532 --> 00:22:15,251
Perhaps makes pillows. Who knows?

257
00:22:19,412 --> 00:22:23,200
Billy, I want you in bed by 10,
you hear me?

258
00:23:17,893 --> 00:23:22,250
You scared the shit out of me.
- I'm sorry about that.

259
00:23:22,413 --> 00:23:24,324
What the hell are you doing here?

260
00:23:26,893 --> 00:23:30,124
Are you alright?
- No, I'm not alright.

261
00:23:30,293 --> 00:23:32,090
Anybody home?

262
00:23:35,493 --> 00:23:37,449
Up here, honey.

263
00:23:55,213 --> 00:23:58,125
This is ridiculous.
- Go to sleep.

264
00:23:58,293 --> 00:24:01,251
Who the hell can sleep
with them doing that all night?

265
00:24:01,413 --> 00:24:03,324
It's been like three hours.

266
00:24:03,493 --> 00:24:05,190
I'll ask him to turn it down.

267
00:24:05,895 --> 00:24:11,768
No, I don't want to make a big thing about it.
- No, if you can't fall asleep...

268
00:24:17,013 --> 00:24:20,642
You think maybe he heard us?
- I hope so.

269
00:24:22,013 --> 00:24:24,652
Where're you going?
- To the bathroom.

270
00:24:32,734 --> 00:24:36,170
I know why guys like you become doctors.

271
00:24:36,334 --> 00:24:38,245
It's not what you yhink.

272
00:24:38,413 --> 00:24:43,168
I think it's to make a lot of money
& see a lot of naked women.

273
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:44,410
Oh.. well..

274
00:24:44,814 --> 00:24:46,850
Then it is what you think.

275
00:24:51,414 --> 00:24:55,885
Hey, ease yourself.
I'm not done with you yet.

276
00:24:56,054 --> 00:24:59,126
I am immune to alcohol.
- Yeah?

277
00:24:59,294 --> 00:25:01,603
We'll see about that.

278
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,033
Tracy.

279
00:25:18,694 --> 00:25:20,571
You alright?

280
00:25:24,574 --> 00:25:26,530
Ya, I'll be right there.

281
00:25:36,294 --> 00:25:39,764
You worried me for a second.
- No, I'm fine.

282
00:25:50,414 --> 00:25:52,450
Come on, let's go to bed.

283
00:26:19,134 --> 00:26:20,613
hey, how you there, old man?

284
00:26:20,775 --> 00:26:22,811
Six miles a day keeps the doctor away.

285
00:26:22,975 --> 00:26:26,684
Want some coffee?
- No, never touch in the morning.

286
00:26:26,855 --> 00:26:29,323
You okay, Tracy ?
- I'm fine.

287
00:26:29,495 --> 00:26:34,364
Well, I'll grab quick shower, fly over to the
hospital. I'll catch you guys later.

288
00:26:53,855 --> 00:26:56,289
Are you sure she didn't call to
cancel her appointment?

289
00:26:56,455 --> 00:26:59,891
Yes, I'm sure that I called her
yesterday to remind her.

290
00:27:00,055 --> 00:27:02,853
Did you try calling her again?
- Nobody's there, professor.

291
00:27:03,015 --> 00:27:06,087
I keep getting her answering machine.
- She's there.

292
00:27:06,255 --> 00:27:08,291
She's not answering it.

293
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,450
Paula?

294
00:29:14,937 --> 00:29:17,451
I'm gonna need a statement.

295
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,250
Andy...

296
00:29:29,457 --> 00:29:32,200
You wanna hear about the first time I
ever saw a corpse?

297
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,200
No.

298
00:29:34,537 --> 00:29:37,900
It was my first year of medical
school, ghost anatomy.

299
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:41,773
The instructor begin cutting the corpse's head.

300
00:29:41,937 --> 00:29:45,009
People were running out of the room.
Some fainted there.

301
00:29:45,176 --> 00:29:48,054
I tell you, it really didn't bother me over that much though.

302
00:29:48,737 --> 00:29:50,170
It's a great story Jed.

303
00:29:50,337 --> 00:29:54,728
Of course, I'm not looking forward to
the same thing but....

304
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:00,252
Hey, You'll get over it.

305
00:30:07,817 --> 00:30:12,937
Hey Stanley, who the hell is that in the backfield?
Livelle or something. He's off the bench (reserve).

306
00:30:13,097 --> 00:30:17,454
What happened to Krakowski?
- Funked the piss test.

307
00:30:19,137 --> 00:30:21,207
That upsets me.

308
00:30:22,258 --> 00:30:26,490
Guy can't stay off of cocaine even for one
million dollars.

309
00:30:27,537 --> 00:30:30,210
Man, I'll give my right arm for
one million dollars.

310
00:30:30,378 --> 00:30:33,370
We cannot afford plumbing for Christ's sake.

311
00:30:34,898 --> 00:30:37,140
Would you really?
- What?

312
00:30:37,657 --> 00:30:40,615
give your right arm for one million dollars?

313
00:30:43,058 --> 00:30:45,447
You mean like, literally?
- Yeah.

314
00:30:46,898 --> 00:30:51,210
Well, not even an arm.
Let's just say a finger.

315
00:30:53,177 --> 00:30:59,889
One finger, for one milion dollars?
Oh god, this is a strange conversation.

316
00:31:00,057 --> 00:31:02,969
What we're talking about is a surgical procedure just...

317
00:31:03,138 --> 00:31:06,414
...to the joint.
Would you do it ?

318
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,120
No.

319
00:31:11,938 --> 00:31:12,950
Really?

320
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,400
Would you?

321
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,500
No.

322
00:31:26,537 --> 00:31:30,689
I should be getting back
Jed let me....

323
00:31:32,058 --> 00:31:36,609
Hey, stay for one more drink with me.
- Tracy's gonna be home.

324
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,400
I'll see you.
- Yeah.

325
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:47,500
Stanley.

326
00:31:48,658 --> 00:31:52,890
Would you please bring those two girls
a round of whatever it is they're drinking?

327
00:31:53,059 --> 00:31:56,051
Bourbon.
- Bourbon it is.

328
00:32:08,739 --> 00:32:11,731
Got a minute?
- Sure.

329
00:32:12,939 --> 00:32:17,649
This... is the living room here.
Take a seat.

330
00:32:19,859 --> 00:32:23,056
I just need you to clear up a few things for me.
- Like what?

331
00:32:26,058 --> 00:32:29,334
Paula Bell came to see you 3 times, is that right?
- That's right.

332
00:32:29,499 --> 00:32:33,890
It would have been four times only....
- What is this?

333
00:32:34,059 --> 00:32:39,372
Last night we matched the soil sample taken from
Paula Bell's carpet to a sample taken from your yard.

334
00:32:39,539 --> 00:32:42,337
I went inside, I told you that.

335
00:32:42,499 --> 00:32:46,208
We also matched it to a sample
taken from Bridget Kelly's room.

336
00:32:46,379 --> 00:32:48,900
Bridget came by here to pick up a
letter of recommendation.

337
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,300
Am I a suspect, Dana?

338
00:32:51,668 --> 00:32:53,138
Am I a fucking suspect?

339
00:32:53,699 --> 00:32:56,850
All three victims had been in to see you
before they were attacked.

340
00:32:57,019 --> 00:32:59,214
I found Paula, for Christ's sake.

341
00:32:59,379 --> 00:33:02,496
What was it that made you go to her house?
- She missed her appointment.

342
00:33:02,659 --> 00:33:06,501
So you went to her house?
- Yes, because she was a screw-up & I've a responsibility.

343
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,289
What's your blood type, Andy ?
- O+ve.

344
00:33:09,459 --> 00:33:13,054
See, as luck would have it, you have the same
blood type as the perpetrator.

345
00:33:13,739 --> 00:33:19,496
Dana, this is crazy. In my entire life
I've never harmed anyone.

346
00:33:19,659 --> 00:33:23,447
I believe you.
I don't think you're the guy.

347
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:24,560
Thank you.

348
00:33:27,979 --> 00:33:33,531
I need you to do something for me. It's procedural,
I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't ask you to do it.

349
00:33:33,538 --> 00:33:34,005
Do what?

350
00:33:34,619 --> 00:33:39,215
I need a sperm sample to test
against the one taken from the victims.

351
00:33:39,379 --> 00:33:42,576
I don't believe this.
- It's a simple thing Andy. Maybe in an hour

352
00:33:42,739 --> 00:33:45,811
... you'll be eliminated as a suspect.

353
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,300
What if I refuse?

354
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:51,300
Give the way to my handcuffs.

355
00:33:58,099 --> 00:33:59,800
Damn.
- No, no. It's much better.

356
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:01,600
No, it's not.
- No, it is.

357
00:34:01,419 --> 00:34:05,014
At least you did not hit the
innocent bystanders (people) again.

358
00:34:11,099 --> 00:34:12,851
Beautiful.

359
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,250
Andy.

360
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,700
Andy.

361
00:35:15,541 --> 00:35:16,940
911 Emergency.

362
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:23,100
I'll show you the rotating muscle
if you don't mind, it's right in here okay...

363
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:28,051
...if it tears, you cannot comb hair, let
alone throw the ball.

364
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:33,400
That thing's been beeping all night.
Are you a drug dealer?

365
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:36,011
Yeah, you can say that.

366
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,550
Stanley.

367
00:35:42,341 --> 00:35:43,774
Somebody, talk to me.

368
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,700
We've got massive haemorrhaging.
It's probably an ovary.

369
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:47,300
We'll have some more numbers in a few minutes.

370
00:35:47,741 --> 00:35:50,380
Blood type.
- AB negative. We need more.

371
00:35:50,541 --> 00:35:55,217
Tanya, get a hold of the Mass General, Boston, and
Mercy Hartford. If they're low, we're gonna need donors.

372
00:36:03,061 --> 00:36:07,213
I'm sorry we had to put you through this, Andy.
You can go home now.

373
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:09,600
Andy.

374
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,350
Mr. Safian...
- Yeah.

375
00:36:19,621 --> 00:36:23,978
Your wife's name came up on a 911.
It's a medical emergency.

376
00:36:24,141 --> 00:36:27,531
David, what's the blood pressure?
- 93 above 57.

377
00:36:27,701 --> 00:36:29,180
Heart rate ?
- 86.

378
00:36:29,341 --> 00:36:31,013
Capacity ?
- 27.

379
00:36:31,181 --> 00:36:34,537
Jed, did you see this ?

380
00:36:37,902 --> 00:36:40,496
Four to five weeks would be my guess.

381
00:36:42,941 --> 00:36:46,058
She is pregnant ?
- Not for long.

382
00:36:46,221 --> 00:36:49,816
Her foetus got aborted from the trauma
of the procedure.

383
00:36:58,781 --> 00:37:01,056
Whenever you're ready, doctor.

384
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:05,950
Dr. Hill...

385
00:37:11,181 --> 00:37:12,933
Alright, let's begin.

386
00:37:17,261 --> 00:37:19,456
Scalpel.
- Scalpel.

387
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,650
Mr. Safian.
- Yeah.

388
00:37:30,902 --> 00:37:33,974
What happened to my wife?
- She's bleeding internally.

389
00:37:34,142 --> 00:37:38,021
Dr. Hill will come and talk to you
soon as her condition is stabilized.

390
00:37:38,182 --> 00:37:41,936
Is she conscious?
- I'm sorry Mr. Safian, that's all I know.

391
00:37:49,262 --> 00:37:53,300
We're almost done. I just wanna have one last
look around. Check for rings and watches. Suction.

392
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:54,800
Suction.

393
00:38:01,062 --> 00:38:04,900
Well, I think we've got it all.
It's amazing it didn't erupt so sooner.

394
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,200
Jed.

395
00:38:10,822 --> 00:38:13,939
You got some pathology in the second ovary.

396
00:38:18,302 --> 00:38:21,135
Let me have a look in here. Harrington.
- Harrington.

397
00:38:22,702 --> 00:38:24,579
It was twisted when I unpacked it.

398
00:38:27,062 --> 00:38:29,292
Think it's necrotic ?

399
00:38:29,462 --> 00:38:33,011
Alright I want to do a frozen section right away,
see if we still get a viable ovary here.

400
00:38:33,183 --> 00:38:34,450
We can't.
- Why not?

401
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,250
The pathologist is not present.
- Then what do I do for frozen section?

402
00:38:37,623 --> 00:38:39,600
We can call him in.
- How long would that take?

403
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:42,550
30-40 minutes.
Hell, then I'd get a microscope and do it myself.

404
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:46,300
It'll take at least a half an hour
for the processor to warm up.

405
00:38:46,463 --> 00:38:48,499
What's the pressure ?
- 78.

406
00:38:48,662 --> 00:38:52,371
I don't have that kind of time.
- You got maybe fifteen minutes.

407
00:38:53,943 --> 00:38:59,063
Alright. Irrigate and try to get the BP
back up. I'll be right back.

408
00:39:04,863 --> 00:39:07,661
Come with me.
- What's going on?

409
00:39:17,223 --> 00:39:20,340
I had to remove one of Tracy's ovaries.

410
00:39:20,503 --> 00:39:25,531
It ruptured. A large cyst had developed in
that what was causing her pain.

411
00:39:25,702 --> 00:39:28,694
I've to be direct with you
because we're little under the gun.

412
00:39:28,863 --> 00:39:31,502
Is it under control?
- Not yet.

413
00:39:31,663 --> 00:39:35,019
There is a problem with Tracy's second ovary.

414
00:39:35,183 --> 00:39:39,256
We discovered it was torsed or twisted
around in its own blood supply.

415
00:39:39,423 --> 00:39:41,937
If I remove it, I'm simply
removing a dead organ...

416
00:39:42,103 --> 00:39:46,221
... and in all likely Tracy will lead a
normal healthy life.

417
00:39:46,383 --> 00:39:48,294
But...

418
00:39:50,303 --> 00:39:54,137
... she won't ever be able to have children.

419
00:39:54,304 --> 00:39:59,424
If I close her up now, she could die of
toxic-shock in the middle of the night.

420
00:40:02,543 --> 00:40:07,856
Do whatever you have to do.
- Tracy's gonna be fine.

421
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:08,750
Yeah.

422
00:40:09,583 --> 00:40:12,336
But what?
- I'll tell you later.

423
00:40:12,503 --> 00:40:14,653
No.
No, tell me now.

424
00:40:24,543 --> 00:40:27,899
Tracy was pregnant.
Of four weeks.

425
00:40:28,064 --> 00:40:33,092
Tracy is pregnant ?
- No Andy. The foetus aborted (dead).

426
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:36,939
She sustained a lot of trauma.
There was nothing that could be done.

427
00:40:38,624 --> 00:40:40,535
I'm sorry about it.

428
00:41:06,904 --> 00:41:08,542
Artery clamp.

429
00:41:08,704 --> 00:41:12,902
Dr. Hill, I think this might be a mistake.
How do you know it's not still viable?

430
00:41:13,064 --> 00:41:17,376
This is the wife of a friend.
I'll not take any chances. Scalpel.

431
00:41:17,544 --> 00:41:21,059
You could be taking out a viable ovary.

432
00:41:22,424 --> 00:41:27,578
It's necrotic. Scalpel.
- Without the histology, you can't be sure.

433
00:41:27,744 --> 00:41:29,575
I'm sure.

434
00:41:29,744 --> 00:41:33,419
Tanya, give me the scalpel.

435
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:16,350
Jed.

436
00:42:22,224 --> 00:42:25,899
What you got there, George ?
- It's from pathology.

437
00:42:28,465 --> 00:42:31,377
Are they Histology report ?

438
00:42:32,504 --> 00:42:35,098
We took out a healthy ovary.

439
00:42:35,265 --> 00:42:38,575
Only the surface was necrotic.

440
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:42,416
Jed, take this.

441
00:42:44,505 --> 00:42:45,700
Look at it.

442
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,150
Then burn it.

443
00:42:52,705 --> 00:42:54,980
That's a nice gesture, George.
Really.

444
00:42:55,145 --> 00:42:58,933
The technician owes me a favour.
Lab won't be a problem.

445
00:42:59,105 --> 00:43:00,663
It'll be a problem for me.

446
00:43:00,826 --> 00:43:04,136
This hospital took out a healthy ovary.

447
00:43:04,305 --> 00:43:07,695
I took out the ovary.
No one else.

448
00:43:07,865 --> 00:43:12,302
It was a judgement call and
I stand by it.

449
00:43:16,345 --> 00:43:20,543
Are you gonna be alright?
- I'll be fine.

450
00:43:22,305 --> 00:43:25,058
I didn't do anything wrong.

451
00:43:44,746 --> 00:43:49,262
I figured you probably hadn't eaten anything in a while.
- We should talk later, okay?

452
00:43:50,665 --> 00:43:56,183
Well, Andy, I wanted to have a word with Tracy.
Maybe later, okay? Jed...

453
00:43:56,346 --> 00:44:01,340
Hello, Mrs. Safian. You gave
us quite a scare.

454
00:44:01,505 --> 00:44:03,336
Did I?

455
00:44:04,466 --> 00:44:06,800
Tracy, I know you've been told
all about what's happened.

456
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:08,450
Yes.

457
00:44:09,306 --> 00:44:12,981
I don't know if there's any point in telling
you how sorry I am.

458
00:44:13,146 --> 00:44:16,821
I spoke with a lawyer this morning.

459
00:44:16,986 --> 00:44:20,456
I want to make sure you don't
do this to someone else.

460
00:44:37,306 --> 00:44:39,945
The legal statements will be in a week.

461
00:44:40,106 --> 00:44:42,745
I think we can bring them down from
the 30 million in a settlement.

462
00:44:42,906 --> 00:44:47,696
Let's not dick each other around here.
30 million, 25 million, what difference does it make?

463
00:44:47,867 --> 00:44:51,906
You know anything over 10 million dollars
& I can't get insurance in this or any other state.

464
00:44:52,066 --> 00:44:53,850
I say we go to a jury.
- I cannot recommend that.

465
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:54,650
Why not?

466
00:44:54,986 --> 00:44:57,341
Let me tell you what a jury sees.

467
00:44:57,507 --> 00:45:01,386
A jury sees a beautiful young woman
married to a mild-mannered teacher.

468
00:45:01,546 --> 00:45:04,856
They buy an old house and dream of
filling it up with children.

469
00:45:05,027 --> 00:45:09,942
Now that is a honey-sweet painting and you
have ripped it to shreds with your scalpel.

470
00:45:10,106 --> 00:45:11,950
You're my lawyer.
Am I right here?

471
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:13,800
It's not my job to hold your hand, doctor.

472
00:45:14,107 --> 00:45:17,300
It's not your job to be an asshole either counsellor
but that doesn't seem to be stopping here.

473
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,818
Maybe if we all calm down.

474
00:45:20,906 --> 00:45:23,898
We could bring in a private investigator,
dig up something on her background.

475
00:45:24,067 --> 00:45:27,343
Lester, she volunteered five days a week
in a children's ward.

476
00:45:27,506 --> 00:45:29,940
And baked cookies for the staff.

477
00:45:30,107 --> 00:45:32,337
Looks like you picked the
wrong patient to screw up on, doctor.

478
00:45:32,507 --> 00:45:37,501
I didn't pick her, counsellor.
Physicians don't get to choose.

479
00:45:37,667 --> 00:45:40,898
I'll need an ''expert''.
Who do you want to call?

480
00:45:41,066 --> 00:45:44,502
What do you mean?
- An expert. Someone to make a statement.

481
00:45:44,667 --> 00:45:48,979
A statement saying what?
- A statement saying that you're as good as you think you are.

482
00:45:53,387 --> 00:45:57,426
Call Dr. Marvin Kessler.
Harvard Medical School.

483
00:45:58,467 --> 00:45:59,100
Is that it Miss?

484
00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:00,500
Yes.

485
00:46:04,467 --> 00:46:07,200
How will I get in touch with you?
- You won't.

486
00:46:08,107 --> 00:46:10,143
I don't want you to.

487
00:46:11,188 --> 00:46:15,147
Tracy, why won't you let me help you
get through this?

488
00:46:15,307 --> 00:46:17,741
This isn't a phase, Andy.

489
00:46:18,787 --> 00:46:22,860
I can't have children. Ever.

490
00:46:23,027 --> 00:46:25,666
He thought you were going to die.

491
00:46:25,827 --> 00:46:28,022
Right about now he's wishing I did.

492
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:32,304
Tracy, I love you.

493
00:46:33,947 --> 00:46:35,850
He took my insights out...

494
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:39,100
And you gave him permission.

495
00:46:43,935 --> 00:46:45,300
Goodbye, Andy.

496
00:47:03,747 --> 00:47:07,581
Dr. Kessler, would you describe your history
& relationship to Dr. Hill?

497
00:47:07,748 --> 00:47:11,263
Dr. Hill was a student of mine at medical school.

498
00:47:11,428 --> 00:47:16,661
From graduation I asked him to serve his
residency under my direction at Mass General.

499
00:47:16,828 --> 00:47:21,538
And when he finished the residency,
I asked him to join our surgical staff.

500
00:47:21,708 --> 00:47:25,178
Dr. Kessler, how long you've been teaching at Harvard Medical school?
- 21 years.

501
00:47:25,348 --> 00:47:28,385
How long you've been chief of staff at Mass General ?
- 14 years.

502
00:47:28,548 --> 00:47:32,302
So you've been in a position to work with thousands of young doctors.
Am I correct?
-Yes.

503
00:47:32,468 --> 00:47:37,747
I might add that the doctors are there a pleasure to teach
& work with are among the very best in the world.

504
00:47:37,908 --> 00:47:43,300
And how would Dr. Hill rank in this group that
are among the very best in the world?
- There is no one any better.

505
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:45,019
Thank You.

506
00:47:45,650 --> 00:47:46,600
Mr. Riley.

507
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:51,827
Dr. Kessler, your faith in Dr. Hill's surgical talent is obvious.

508
00:47:51,989 --> 00:47:53,866
And completely deserved.

509
00:47:54,028 --> 00:47:57,577
Dr. Kessler, seven months ago the position of Chief
of Surgery became available on Mass General.

510
00:47:57,748 --> 00:47:59,818
Did you had Jed Hill seek this position?
- Yes, he did.

511
00:47:59,988 --> 00:48:03,947
Did you give the position to Jed?
- Excuse me, my client's name is Dr. Hill.

512
00:48:04,108 --> 00:48:08,260
Forgive me, did you award the position to Dr. Hill?  - No.
Why not?

513
00:48:08,428 --> 00:48:11,625
Well, he was certainly qualified...
- But you didn't give him the job.

514
00:48:11,788 --> 00:48:13,585
There were many other candidates.

515
00:48:13,748 --> 00:48:16,899
Surgeons more qualified?
- This isn't the trial, Mr. Riley.

516
00:48:17,068 --> 00:48:21,027
Dr. Kessler, during Dr. Hill's residency in Mass General
you wrote several co-orderly valuations.

517
00:48:21,189 --> 00:48:24,818
The valuations to be read and
reviewed by hospital administrators...

518
00:48:24,988 --> 00:48:27,263
... department heads.
- Yes.

519
00:48:27,428 --> 00:48:34,459
I'm looking at one... right now dated
June 15th, 1982 & bearing your signature.

520
00:48:34,628 --> 00:48:36,346
It's coming up.

521
00:48:39,949 --> 00:48:45,899
I'd like to read fom page 3, paragraph 4...

522
00:48:46,068 --> 00:48:48,946
While Jed Hill consistently remains the
most skilled and the brightest of our residents...

523
00:48:49,109 --> 00:48:54,422
... we should not ignore what the authorities of this
college observed that he suffers from "God Complex".

524
00:48:54,589 --> 00:48:58,264
'God-Complex'. That's not a typo, was it?
It says 'God-Complex'.

525
00:48:59,429 --> 00:49:04,059
That was read nearly a decade ago.
- What's a 'God-Complex' ?

526
00:49:04,229 --> 00:49:06,743
How did you get this information? This was priviledged...
- Dr. Kessler...

527
00:49:06,909 --> 00:49:08,581
What's a 'God-Complex' ?

528
00:49:08,749 --> 00:49:13,425
It's a term that has no clinical meaning... at all.
Doctors throw it around...

529
00:49:13,589 --> 00:49:15,100
Sir, with all due respect, but knock it off.

530
00:49:15,150 --> 00:49:18,350
What did you mean in this evaluation when
you said Dr. Hill had a 'God-Complex' ?

531
00:49:19,069 --> 00:49:25,178
The power to heal can be an enormous thing,
an enormous thing...

532
00:49:25,349 --> 00:49:29,183
to save a life. To get blood flowing into cells
and vital organs.

533
00:49:29,349 --> 00:49:35,345
If a person can do that... And if one can do it
as exceptionally as Dr. Hill...

534
00:49:35,509 --> 00:49:40,708
... it's not uncommon for a person like that
to begin to believe that he can do anything.

535
00:49:40,870 --> 00:49:44,909
The power to heal can be like a drug.

536
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:45,900
'Like a drug', you're saying ?

537
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:50,250
Would it've been uncommon for a person with a
'God-complex' to reject the advice of others?

538
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,069
No.

539
00:49:52,310 --> 00:49:54,450
Would it've been uncommon for such a person to....

540
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:58,450
proceed on a course that others might reject
if only out of a sense of a God like power?

541
00:49:58,910 --> 00:50:00,582
Oh, now I think you're vastly overstating.

542
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:04,459
Is that why you didn't give Dr. Hill the job?
- There were a number of other factors.

543
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:07,349
Is that why you removed a healthy ovary
without any scientific diagnosis?

544
00:50:07,509 --> 00:50:11,297
Don't you address my client, Mr. Riley.
- Do you have a 'God-complex' ?

545
00:50:11,469 --> 00:50:13,850
This is not acceptable.
- No, no. Let him address me.

546
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:17,862
Jed.
-No, No. It's about time I got to give some answers here.

547
00:50:18,030 --> 00:50:20,863
Stop typing.
This is off the record.

548
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:28,939
The question is, do I have a 'God-complex'.
- Dr. Kessler says yes.

549
00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:36,300
which makes me wonder if this lawyer has any idea...

550
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:39,303
... as to the kind of grades one has
to receive in college...

551
00:50:39,469 --> 00:50:42,586
... to be accepted at a top medical school.

552
00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:46,060
If you have the vaguest clue as to
how talented someone has to be...

553
00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:50,109
... to lead a surgical team.

554
00:50:50,270 --> 00:50:52,830
I have an M.D. from Harvard,

555
00:50:52,990 --> 00:50:57,541
I am board certified in cardio-thoracic medicine
and trauma surgery,

556
00:50:57,710 --> 00:51:01,783
I have been awarded citations from seven
different medical boards in New England,

557
00:51:01,950 --> 00:51:05,704
and I am never, ever sick at sea.

558
00:51:05,870 --> 00:51:08,065
So I ask you:

559
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:12,348
when someone goes into that chapel and they
fall on their knees and they pray to God...

560
00:51:12,510 --> 00:51:16,583
...that their wife doesn't miscarry or that their
daughter doesn't bleed to death...

561
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:22,029
...or that their mother doesn't suffer acute
neural trauma from post-operative shock,

562
00:51:22,191 --> 00:51:23,988
...who do you think they're praying to?

563
00:51:26,471 --> 00:51:31,591
Now, go ahead and read your Bible, Dennis,
and you go to your church,

564
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:36,460
and, with any luck, you might win the annual raffle,
but if you're looking for God:

565
00:51:36,631 --> 00:51:40,067
he was in operating room number two on November 17,

566
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:43,620
and he doesn't like to be second guessed.

567
00:51:44,831 --> 00:51:49,029
You ask me if I have a 'God complex'.
Let me tell you something:

568
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:51,181
I am God.

569
00:51:52,631 --> 00:51:55,384
This sideshow is over.

570
00:52:03,990 --> 00:52:06,788
You got a winner here, Lester.

571
00:52:06,951 --> 00:52:10,421
Call my office, in the morning
and we'll work out a settlement.

572
00:52:10,591 --> 00:52:13,628
It gets better.
- What do you mean?

573
00:52:13,791 --> 00:52:17,147
We talked to the bartender of a
place called Prince William Tavern.

574
00:52:17,311 --> 00:52:22,146
Ask 'God' how many shots of bourbon he had before he cut me open.

575
00:52:27,911 --> 00:52:31,586
The insurance company will be drafting
to my firm's account by sometime next week...

576
00:52:31,751 --> 00:52:35,346
So if you sign right away, you should get
your money few days after that.

577
00:52:35,511 --> 00:52:38,469
Listen there are some things we
should discuss now that can embroil a policy.

578
00:52:38,632 --> 00:52:42,386
Dennis, this isn't such a good time for me.
- We're talking about 20 million dollars.

579
00:52:42,552 --> 00:52:45,430
Dennis, I think about what I want for breakfast,
I start crying.

580
00:52:45,592 --> 00:52:48,982
You could put the money in a coffee pot,
for all I care.

581
00:53:25,832 --> 00:53:29,188
It's 8:30.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

582
00:53:29,351 --> 00:53:33,390
You should go home.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

583
00:53:42,491 --> 00:53:43,800
Mrs. Worthington.

584
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:46,650
Mrs. Worthington.

585
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:48,200
Mr. Leemus.

586
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,400
Mr. Leemus.

587
00:55:50,975 --> 00:55:52,002
Christ!

588
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:55,264
You surprised me. Holy Shi...

589
00:55:55,433 --> 00:55:59,665
I was working on the front.
I didn't know anybody else was here.

590
00:55:59,834 --> 00:56:03,622
I saw the lights...
- It's my mother's hair.

591
00:56:03,794 --> 00:56:07,389
She's not alive anymore.
That's her in the picture.

592
00:56:10,474 --> 00:56:13,625
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to get any of your things. I..
- No, that's okay.

593
00:56:15,154 --> 00:56:19,352
I came down to get a light,
I didn't realize...

594
00:56:21,914 --> 00:56:25,429
You live down here?
- No, no. Just for a while.

595
00:56:25,593 --> 00:56:29,029
My landlady asked me to leave.

596
00:56:29,193 --> 00:56:31,468
I won't stay here long.
No, I promise Mr. Safian.

597
00:56:31,633 --> 00:56:34,431
No, you stay here as long as you want.

598
00:56:34,594 --> 00:56:36,900
I'll just take this and I'll go back up.

599
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:40,700
Good night, Mr. Safian.
- Good night, Earl.

600
00:57:58,554 --> 00:58:01,068
Don't worry, it doesn't look as
bad as the other guy.

601
00:58:01,234 --> 00:58:03,748
I could have killed him.

602
00:58:05,635 --> 00:58:10,106
Junior, have you met the professor?
A very tough guy.

603
00:58:10,274 --> 00:58:14,028
If you want something done, alright
goddamn it, you call a teacher.

604
00:58:15,235 --> 00:58:17,351
Let me buy you a drink.

605
00:58:27,915 --> 00:58:31,430
You know, there is one thing I
realized during all this.

606
00:58:31,595 --> 00:58:35,634
Jed had just come out of the OR to
talk to me. He was covered in blood and

607
00:58:35,795 --> 00:58:40,789
he was telling me what he was about to
do and then he needed my permission to do it.

608
00:58:40,955 --> 00:58:45,028
And...there was a second, maybe a
second and a half....

609
00:58:45,195 --> 00:58:48,028
...between him telling me that Tracy
was pregnant and...

610
00:58:48,195 --> 00:58:51,824
... then telling me that the foetus was
aborted during surgery.

611
00:58:53,435 --> 00:58:57,906
That second,
that second and a half...

612
00:58:59,275 --> 00:59:02,585
... that was the happiest time in my life.

613
00:59:07,035 --> 00:59:11,586
That is a horrible story.
It's the worst story I've ever heard.

614
00:59:12,676 --> 00:59:17,466
And I aprreciate your words of comfort.
- I mean it, Andy.

615
00:59:17,635 --> 00:59:21,230
Like a fucking job,
shit just happens to you.

616
00:59:23,395 --> 00:59:27,434
Have you had a lot of success talking
jumpers in from window ledges?

617
00:59:32,155 --> 00:59:34,500
May I ask you something?
- Sure.

618
00:59:35,596 --> 00:59:41,068
How well do you know Tracy ?
-  She's my wife. What do you mean ?

619
00:59:48,316 --> 00:59:52,355
My brothers, my friends and my ex-husband...

620
00:59:52,516 --> 00:59:57,670
... have all accused me of wielding my sense
of honesty like a blunt instrument.

621
00:59:57,836 --> 01:00:01,850
I don't want to hurt you anymore
than you've been but...

622
01:00:03,236 --> 01:00:06,467
... I'm very sure I'm doing the right thing.

623
01:00:06,636 --> 01:00:08,831
What are you talking about ?

624
01:00:11,716 --> 01:00:16,915
I want you to come back to the station with me.
I must show you something.

625
01:00:40,197 --> 01:00:44,190
Sir, sir can I help you?
- I'm here to see Jed Hill.

626
01:00:59,477 --> 01:01:03,072
What the hell happened to you?
- It wasn't my baby.

627
01:01:03,090 --> 01:01:04,180
What?

628
01:01:04,237 --> 01:01:06,228
It wasn't my baby.

629
01:01:06,397 --> 01:01:09,355
Come inside.
What the hell happened to your face?

630
01:01:09,516 --> 01:01:11,871
Doesn't matter.
You know what this is?

631
01:01:12,037 --> 01:01:14,500
This is a police test.
A lab report.

632
01:01:15,050 --> 01:01:15,750
I don't understand.

633
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:18,794
It's my sperm sample I left after
Paula Bell rape.

634
01:01:18,957 --> 01:01:20,600
I'm sterile.

635
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:23,850
Can I have a look at that, please ?

636
01:01:24,717 --> 01:01:28,400
I can't have any children, so it
wasn't my baby.

637
01:01:29,756 --> 01:01:30,850
You got to call your lawyer Jed.

638
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:34,680
You call your lawyer, you haven't tell the
insurance company to stop the presses because...

639
01:01:34,757 --> 01:01:36,350
... this thing. No, it's not over yet.

640
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:40,588
Oh, Andy. This isn't about me.
It's about both of us, Jed.

641
01:01:40,757 --> 01:01:44,545
She ruined both of us. It's too late for me
but it's not too late for you.

642
01:01:44,717 --> 01:01:48,346
Andy, I don't mean to seem indelicate but
as far as my situation is concerned...

643
01:01:48,517 --> 01:01:51,987
... it doesn't matter if Tracy was sleeping
with the Boston Celtics.

644
01:01:52,157 --> 01:01:55,200
I took out her reproductive system.

645
01:01:56,558 --> 01:01:59,868
It was a wrong call and the bill was
20 million dollars.
- No.

646
01:02:00,037 --> 01:02:03,996
That's where you're wrong. See, the
20 million dollars is a big settlement, right?

647
01:02:04,157 --> 01:02:07,706
That wasn't for the fuck-up.
That...that was for the victim.

648
01:02:07,877 --> 01:02:12,428
The insurance company settled high and fast because
they thought they're up against Snow White.

649
01:02:12,597 --> 01:02:16,800
What happens if Snow White is shacking up
with her lawyer Jed, huh?

650
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:18,650
You tell me.

651
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:21,511
Andy, you're hurt & you
want revenge.

652
01:02:21,677 --> 01:02:25,033
& I can understand that, but I got
what I deserved.

653
01:02:25,198 --> 01:02:28,634
and you know something,
as much as this pains you...

654
01:02:28,798 --> 01:02:31,260
...no matter what Tracy was doing
behind your back...

655
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:35,990
she got a hell of a
lot worse than she deserved.

656
01:02:36,878 --> 01:02:39,346
Did I?

657
01:02:39,517 --> 01:02:44,113
Did you what?
- Did I get what I deserved?

658
01:02:44,277 --> 01:02:48,589
Bad things happen to good people all the time,
Andy & for no reason.

659
01:02:48,758 --> 01:02:50,714
Take my word for it.

660
01:02:53,438 --> 01:02:55,394
I'll see you later.

661
01:02:57,798 --> 01:02:59,516
What're you gotta do Andy ?

662
01:03:00,597 --> 01:03:03,589
I'm gonna go out and
get to know my wife.

663
01:03:17,950 --> 01:03:18,360
Hi Dennis !

664
01:03:18,637 --> 01:03:20,435
He doesn't have an appointment, Mr. Riley.
He just walked right on.

665
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:22,000
She tried to stop me, Dennis.

666
01:03:22,398 --> 01:03:26,550
See, I can call him Dennis coz we're old friends.
We both slept with my wife.

667
01:03:26,718 --> 01:03:30,108
Claudia, call security.
- Do that Claudia and then call the US Attorney's office...

668
01:03:30,278 --> 01:03:33,953
... and see if conspiracy to commit insurance fraud
comes under their jurisdiction.

669
01:03:34,118 --> 01:03:39,112
Forget security, Claudia. Just close the door
behind you. Thank you.

670
01:03:45,490 --> 01:03:51,516
This...This is a nice office.
- What the hell happened to your face?

671
01:03:51,678 --> 01:03:56,752
I beat the shit out of a deeply
disturbed serial rapist.

672
01:03:56,975 --> 01:04:01,869
Hey, I want an explanation.
- An explanation for what ?

673
01:04:02,039 --> 01:04:06,669
For how my wife could have been pregnant
when her husband's sterile?

674
01:04:07,838 --> 01:04:10,796
What was it - Immaculate Conception ?

675
01:04:10,958 --> 01:04:15,190
If that's the case, Dennis, I wouldn't have settled for
20 million if I were you.

676
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:17,793
Andy, I had no knowledge of this.

677
01:04:17,959 --> 01:04:21,429
And I wasn't sleeping with your wife if
that's what you're suggesting.

678
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:26,468
Bullshit.
- Then what can I do for you, Andy ?

679
01:04:26,639 --> 01:04:28,595
You can tell me where Tracy is.

680
01:04:28,759 --> 01:04:33,196
Telling you where Tracy is would break an Attorney-Client
privilege & I will not do that.

681
01:04:33,359 --> 01:04:37,318
Now there is nothing more I can do.
Claudia'ill be happy to call the US Attorney for you.

682
01:04:39,238 --> 01:04:40,468
Were you sleeping with her?

683
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:41,900
No.

684
01:04:47,479 --> 01:04:52,507
Can you help me?
- Help you do what? What is it you want Andy?

685
01:04:58,119 --> 01:05:02,271
I want to talk to Tracy.
I know I'm asking you a favour...

686
01:05:02,439 --> 01:05:05,715
I've a professional obligation.
I've a legal obligation to my client.

687
01:05:05,879 --> 01:05:09,508
Your problems, your questions,
cold as this may seem are not my business.

688
01:05:09,679 --> 01:05:12,432
And I haven't got the answers you want.
Even if I did, I wouldn't be able to give them to you.

689
01:05:12,599 --> 01:05:16,592
Talk to her friends, talk to her
mother & talk to other people.

690
01:05:16,759 --> 01:05:19,557
What did you say?
- I'm saying this is a personal matter.

691
01:05:19,719 --> 01:05:23,234
Did you say 'talk to her mother'?
- She certainly knows Tracy better than I do.

692
01:05:23,399 --> 01:05:25,435
Her mother is dead.

693
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:29,115
When did she die?
- Twelve years ago.

694
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:32,238
You handled the estate.

695
01:05:32,399 --> 01:05:35,277
No, I didn't.
- What're you saying to me?

696
01:05:35,439 --> 01:05:38,100
I'm saying I didn't handle Mrs. Kennsinger's
estate and anything

697
01:05:38,108 --> 01:05:40,000
else rather than framework of your
wife's lawsuit is not my...

698
01:05:40,199 --> 01:05:43,794
I don't give a fuck about the lawsuit. I'm asking...
- Then we have nothing here to talk about.

699
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:47,191
Is her mother alive?
Where does she live?

700
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:50,909
Please understand...
- Fuck it. I'll find her myself.

701
01:05:51,378 --> 01:05:52,378
Andy...

702
01:05:54,079 --> 01:05:57,196
Scotch.
- What?

703
01:05:57,359 --> 01:05:59,827
Bring her a bottle of scotch.

704
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:25,356
My name is Andy Safian.
- So what ?

705
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:29,278
Did your daughter ever tell you
she had a husband?

706
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:32,318
Did your wife ever tell you
she had a mother?
- Yeah.

707
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:34,596
You're a liar.

708
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:39,436
She said you were dead.
- What do you want from me ?

709
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:42,672
I...it's nothing. I just want...
- Nobody wants nothing.

710
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:47,389
I thought maybe we could
have a drink and talk.

711
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:06,836
She sure loved her daddy.
Second on the place of the best swindlers in Boston.

712
01:07:07,001 --> 01:07:10,596
He taught her everything.
She was daddy's girl.

713
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:13,069
I wanted to ask you some questions.

714
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:15,800
She tried to do the smart thing,
I give you that.

715
01:07:16,050 --> 01:07:19,910
The smart thing. What was that?
- Marry a rich fellow. What do you think?

716
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:24,551
Tracy was married before?
- I said she tried.

717
01:07:24,721 --> 01:07:26,837
You got to pay attention.

718
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:32,199
One of Bill's old partners, a guy from Newport.
Millionaire with a heart problem.

719
01:07:32,361 --> 01:07:36,912
He wouldn't marry her though.
Not even after she got pregnant.

720
01:07:37,100 --> 01:07:38,450
Mrs. Kennsinger.

721
01:07:40,721 --> 01:07:46,193
This is single malt scotch.
That was so classy Mister.

722
01:07:46,361 --> 01:07:49,956
I haven't had single malt since '69.

723
01:07:50,121 --> 01:07:55,070
I drink crap. Blended whisky is crap,
I don't give what colour the label is.

724
01:07:55,241 --> 01:07:57,880
I need to find Tracy.

725
01:07:58,041 --> 01:08:00,794
Tell me the part again where she was
working with children's ward.

726
01:08:00,961 --> 01:08:05,159
I can tell you, she likes kids so she....

727
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:08,100
What?

728
01:08:09,201 --> 01:08:10,100
What?

729
01:08:10,950 --> 01:08:12,400
Did I say something funny?

730
01:08:14,321 --> 01:08:19,441
She indeed found herself a dork (fool).
Like shooting tuna fish in a barrel.

731
01:08:22,681 --> 01:08:24,637
Big one too.

732
01:08:28,561 --> 01:08:31,678
You're drunk.
- And you're stupid.

733
01:08:33,282 --> 01:08:36,558
I can say that to you because
you're my son-in-law.

734
01:08:37,802 --> 01:08:42,318
Want to see something ?
- I want you to tell me where Tracy is.

735
01:08:42,481 --> 01:08:46,918
I'm older, I'm smarter.
You can learn something from me.

736
01:08:47,081 --> 01:08:49,914
I know she's been here.

737
01:08:50,081 --> 01:08:52,550
Andy... is it Andy?

738
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:54,100
Yeah.

739
01:08:54,300 --> 01:08:55,100
Andy...

740
01:08:56,562 --> 01:08:59,700
It's a simple trick.
- The statue...

741
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:00,250
What?

742
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:04,832
This, the Degas.
- What about it ?

743
01:09:05,002 --> 01:09:09,996
It was in my house. It was Tracy's.
So I know she's been here.

744
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:11,300
Andy...

745
01:09:11,962 --> 01:09:17,161
Believe me. You need to see this trick.
- Do you get that I'm serious?

746
01:09:17,322 --> 01:09:20,439
I got it. Pick a card.

747
01:09:30,602 --> 01:09:32,797
Look at it.

748
01:09:34,482 --> 01:09:36,518
Put it back in the deck.

749
01:09:43,602 --> 01:09:45,558
Shuffle the deck.

750
01:09:45,722 --> 01:09:48,680
Mrs. Kennsinger, I don't want...
- You can call me 'Mom'.

751
01:09:50,642 --> 01:09:52,678
I don't think so.

752
01:09:53,842 --> 01:09:57,437
Shuffle the cards. And shuffle them good.

753
01:09:59,442 --> 01:10:04,994
We used to give Tracy some money each week
so she could buy candy. Shuffle the cards!

754
01:10:07,163 --> 01:10:11,793
She won't spend it though, not a penny.
Each week she put it under the mattress.

755
01:10:12,843 --> 01:10:16,518
I swear I think there could
be $ 200 under the mattress.

756
01:10:17,562 --> 01:10:20,759
I'll tell you something else about Tracy...

757
01:10:20,922 --> 01:10:25,598
I don't think it bothered her a bit when her father
cleaned up the bank accounts and disappeared.

758
01:10:27,323 --> 01:10:32,397
I think it bothered her when he took
the 200 dollars from under the mattress.

759
01:10:32,562 --> 01:10:35,395
Jesus! what the hell kind of a family is this ?

760
01:10:36,482 --> 01:10:38,438
Want to bet?
- What?

761
01:10:38,602 --> 01:10:42,914
200 bucks. You will give me 200 bucks if I guess
where your card is else I give you 200 bucks.

762
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:44,150
No.

763
01:10:44,803 --> 01:10:47,442
Because once money is involved,
you take me seriously, right?

764
01:10:47,603 --> 01:10:49,275
Look, you said there was a point here and I....

765
01:10:49,442 --> 01:10:52,161
Why do you give a Frenchman's fuck who
she was sleeping with?

766
01:10:52,323 --> 01:10:56,874
Get into the game.
Go for the 20 million yourself.

767
01:10:57,042 --> 01:10:59,431
Are you saying that Tracy set this up?

768
01:10:59,603 --> 01:11:03,596
What the hell have I been telling you?
Am I talking to my shadow?

769
01:11:04,723 --> 01:11:07,556
You think you're Sherlock Holmes with this statue?

770
01:11:07,723 --> 01:11:11,557
You can buy them in any departmental store...
89, 95. Looks just like the real thing.

771
01:11:11,723 --> 01:11:17,195
The whole thing was a setup?
You're crazy.

772
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:19,100
Yeah ?

773
01:11:19,883 --> 01:11:23,592
Then how come I have the Jack of Clubs
in my fucking pocket?

774
01:11:33,444 --> 01:11:36,481
Look kid, I don't know what the game is.

775
01:11:36,643 --> 01:11:39,953
But you got stung,
so did your friend, the surgeon.

776
01:11:40,123 --> 01:11:44,435
Maybe, it's best to just take a medicine
like a good little boy and go home.

777
01:11:44,604 --> 01:11:48,563
But do me a favour.
Leave me this scotch.

778
01:11:54,043 --> 01:11:59,276
What happened to the baby?   - What baby?
- The Newport millionaire, their baby.

779
01:12:00,324 --> 01:12:03,236
She pocketed the money he
gave her for an abortion.

780
01:12:03,403 --> 01:12:07,078
Went downtown to a clinic.
She ended up working for the doctor.

781
01:12:07,244 --> 01:12:09,314
And there's a happy ending.

782
01:12:09,483 --> 01:12:12,634
She disappeared with 80,000 dollars of
the clinic's money.

783
01:12:12,803 --> 01:12:15,476
How much of that do you think I saw?
What was the name of the doctor?

784
01:12:15,644 --> 01:12:17,475
How much you think I'm going to see
from this 20 million?

785
01:12:17,643 --> 01:12:19,750
Was the name of the doctor David Lillianfield ?

786
01:12:19,900 --> 01:12:21,850
How much do you think she's gonna give her dead mother?

787
01:12:21,924 --> 01:12:23,277
Was it?
- Was what what?

788
01:12:23,444 --> 01:12:25,400
You think you can drink like this
and remember a name ?

789
01:12:25,564 --> 01:12:28,522
Was the name of the doctor David Lillianfield ?

790
01:12:31,244 --> 01:12:33,200
Welcome to the game.

791
01:13:03,044 --> 01:13:05,399
CODE BLUE
ANSWERING SERVICE

792
01:13:20,650 --> 01:13:21,700
Hello!

793
01:13:26,820 --> 01:13:27,700
Excuse me.

794
01:13:29,245 --> 01:13:31,201
Can I talk to your manager ?

795
01:13:36,285 --> 01:13:39,800
Mr. Hearn leaves at 5 o'clock.
You're gonna have to come back tomorrow.

796
01:13:39,964 --> 01:13:42,398
I'm Dr. Lillianfield.
Mr. Hearn wanted me to come by to fill...

797
01:13:42,565 --> 01:13:46,524
... out a change of address card for your billing.

798
01:13:56,965 --> 01:14:00,241
Is that Lillianfield ?
- Yeah. David.

799
01:14:03,565 --> 01:14:09,242
Why don't you just write it on the back of the old
card and we'll take care of the rest tomorrow.

800
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:10,400
Thanks.

801
01:16:59,166 --> 01:17:01,122
Where is the key ?

802
01:17:06,686 --> 01:17:08,438
I'm soaked.

803
01:17:09,207 --> 01:17:11,084
God! I'm freezing.

804
01:17:12,127 --> 01:17:14,163
It's cold in here.

805
01:17:16,527 --> 01:17:20,679
We must do something about the latch.

806
01:17:22,847 --> 01:17:25,486
Oh, this damn door is driving me crazy.

807
01:17:29,687 --> 01:17:31,643
I am frozen through.

808
01:17:37,767 --> 01:17:39,723
Warm me up, I'm freezing.

809
01:17:45,807 --> 01:17:48,275
Take me upstairs and fuck me.

810
01:20:22,168 --> 01:20:25,683
I should be heading back to town.
- We just got here.

811
01:20:25,849 --> 01:20:28,807
I know, but it's broad daylight.

812
01:20:29,849 --> 01:20:34,286
Relax. It's a done deal.
I'm getting the cheque on Monday.

813
01:20:37,049 --> 01:20:39,005
What's wrong with you?

814
01:20:40,248 --> 01:20:43,160
I got a letter today.
- From who ?

815
01:20:43,329 --> 01:20:48,198
Whom, from whom. From Dr. Kessler.
- What did he say ?

816
01:20:48,369 --> 01:20:50,300
He didn't say, Tracy. It was a letter.
He wrote.

817
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:54,900
Jed, take a drink, take a pill, do whatever it is
you have to, but lighten the fuck up.

818
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:56,500
What did he write?

819
01:20:58,330 --> 01:21:01,606
That he was sorry.
That he was very sorry.

820
01:21:02,649 --> 01:21:04,207
That was thoughtful of him.

821
01:21:06,100 --> 01:21:06,900
What?

822
01:21:07,489 --> 01:21:12,085
That was. The man put himself at the top.
I was in the room. The bartender was just icing..

823
01:21:12,249 --> 01:21:14,922
... but Kessler's (testimony) was the one who closed it.

824
01:21:15,089 --> 01:21:21,608
Common, what more do you want from the man?
- I want him to know it.

825
01:21:21,769 --> 01:21:25,318
I want him to know that I was holding the strings.

826
01:21:25,490 --> 01:21:29,324
He's sorry? Let him say he was sorry
about Mass General.

827
01:21:29,489 --> 01:21:32,561
When he says he was wrong, when he
says that I should have gotten the job then...

828
01:21:32,730 --> 01:21:36,689
... you talk about bygones being bygones.

829
01:21:45,370 --> 01:21:49,727
In the meantime, I think I'll send him a postcard.
- There, that's the spirit.

830
01:21:49,890 --> 01:21:53,849
A picture of me sitting under a
palm tree with 10 million dollars in one hand...

831
01:21:54,010 --> 01:21:57,525
... and a copy of his 'God-complex'
memo in the other.

832
01:21:58,570 --> 01:22:01,164
With an inscription.
- What would it say?

833
01:22:01,330 --> 01:22:04,800
It wouldn't say anything. It would read.
- Good going, Trace.

834
01:22:04,970 --> 01:22:06,562
What would it read?

835
01:22:06,730 --> 01:22:10,882
Never under-estimate a genius with
a 'chip on your shoulder'.

836
01:23:31,491 --> 01:23:33,447
What the fuck was that ?

837
01:23:36,100 --> 01:23:37,300
Oh my God.

838
01:23:38,290 --> 01:23:40,246
Where did that come from?

839
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:43,800
Andy.
- What?

840
01:23:45,291 --> 01:23:49,125
Andy's been here.
- What are you talking about ?

841
01:23:50,171 --> 01:23:53,846
He knows.
- Then why aren't the police knocking on the door ?

842
01:23:54,891 --> 01:23:57,530
Because he's playing with us.
- Andy?

843
01:23:57,691 --> 01:24:00,410
I don't believe it.
- Believe it.

844
01:24:00,571 --> 01:24:04,280
How could he possibly...
- Well, let's think about that for a moment, shall we?.

845
01:24:04,451 --> 01:24:07,807
What could we have done wrong ?
Let's retrace the plan...

846
01:24:07,971 --> 01:24:13,967
... and see if we can put our finger on a detail we
may have overlooked. One of us may have improvised.

847
01:24:14,132 --> 01:24:17,363
One of us may have decided that to get
pregnant would double the money.

848
01:24:17,531 --> 01:24:21,150
It did double the money. Now I don't want
to hear about it anymore. It is history.

849
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:22,350
Oh, no..no. No kidding.

850
01:24:22,731 --> 01:24:27,407
It's the present. It's the here and the now
and the needle in the haystack.

851
01:24:27,571 --> 01:24:28,900
Let me ask you something.

852
01:24:29,100 --> 01:24:32,400
Once he found out he was sterile,
how long do you think it took him...

853
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:35,084
... to figure out there was no Dr. Lillianfield ?

854
01:24:35,252 --> 01:24:39,768
Do you understand what I'm saying?
There wasn't supposed to be a baby.

855
01:24:43,811 --> 01:24:45,767
I'll take care of Andy.

856
01:25:09,972 --> 01:25:11,928
Don't get up.

857
01:25:13,452 --> 01:25:16,250
What happened to your face?

858
01:25:16,412 --> 01:25:17,765
I tripped.

859
01:25:18,812 --> 01:25:22,805
I heard they caught the guy, the rapist.
- Yeah.

860
01:25:22,971 --> 01:25:25,121
Well, that must be a load off your mind.

861
01:25:26,212 --> 01:25:29,363
Yeah, it's great to finally have
things back to normal.

862
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:31,750
Andy...

863
01:25:32,732 --> 01:25:35,849
They can be back to normal.

864
01:25:36,012 --> 01:25:36,800
What's that?

865
01:25:38,450 --> 01:25:39,500
Things.

866
01:25:41,132 --> 01:25:43,088
Our life.

867
01:25:44,252 --> 01:25:46,208
Remember me?

868
01:25:51,172 --> 01:25:53,128
Tracy.
- What ?

869
01:25:55,452 --> 01:25:57,600
I think you dropped your shoe.

870
01:26:00,212 --> 01:26:04,251
What can I get you?
- We'll have two glasses of house wine.

871
01:26:04,412 --> 01:26:06,846
Is Chardonnay alright?
- It'll be fine.

872
01:26:07,012 --> 01:26:09,162
Anything else ?
- Some privacy.

873
01:26:12,733 --> 01:26:16,692
Now I'm going to talk for a minute,
So it would be better if you don't interrupt me, okay?

874
01:26:17,732 --> 01:26:21,122
I found a hypodermic needle in my bed.

875
01:26:21,292 --> 01:26:24,284
I don't know who put it there,
it doesn't matter.

876
01:26:24,453 --> 01:26:28,048
What matters, is that I didn't think it was funny.

877
01:26:28,212 --> 01:26:31,000
And as you well know,
I've a healthy sense of humour.

878
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:33,765
So what I'm saying is this:

879
01:26:35,132 --> 01:26:39,967
Whoever played that joke is playing in a league
that's just not ready for it.

880
01:26:41,853 --> 01:26:45,562
Now I came here hoping we
could reach an understanding.

881
01:26:45,733 --> 01:26:51,171
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to hold grudge on this one, Trace.
- Oh, go to cops. They'll call you crazy.

882
01:26:51,333 --> 01:26:54,962
While still we have another school, why don't you
try getting a teaching job? 'Happy Hunting', Andy.

883
01:26:55,105 --> 01:26:57,249
Sit the fuck down.
- What?

884
01:26:57,412 --> 01:27:02,008
I said, sit the fuck down.
I'm running the show now.

885
01:27:04,933 --> 01:27:07,606
You're running it with an empty hypodermic needle?

886
01:27:07,773 --> 01:27:10,526
I'm running it with trace amounts of Pergonal.

887
01:27:18,093 --> 01:27:19,890
Here it is.

888
01:27:20,934 --> 01:27:25,300
Mam, would you happen to know anything
about a drug called Pergonal?

889
01:27:25,400 --> 01:27:26,400
I'm sorry.

890
01:27:26,893 --> 01:27:28,246
Never mind.
That's alright.

891
01:27:30,574 --> 01:27:33,532
It's a fertility drug, Andy.
I was trying to get pregnant.

892
01:27:33,693 --> 01:27:38,403
A fertility drug.
That's exactly what the lab guys told me.

893
01:27:38,573 --> 01:27:42,088
But it turns out that Pergonal,
when it's injected in like massive quantities....

894
01:27:42,253 --> 01:27:45,325
... can actually create ovarian cysts.

895
01:27:45,493 --> 01:27:49,884
They gathered brilliant young surgeon around
Trace, coz you gave us all quite a scare.

896
01:27:50,053 --> 01:27:53,125
It dissolved in the ovaries, so
you don't have clue how much I was taking.

897
01:27:53,293 --> 01:27:57,571
That's right.
It's not like I had a witness.

898
01:27:57,734 --> 01:28:00,806
I mean if I had a witness who saw
Jed giving you the injections...

899
01:28:00,974 --> 01:28:04,933
... you bought, both of you would be spending
the rest of your sexually active years ....

900
01:28:05,093 --> 01:28:09,644
... in a place where you'll work very good
such as prison laundry.

901
01:28:09,814 --> 01:28:11,327
You're bluffing.

902
01:28:11,450 --> 01:28:12,250
Tracy...

903
01:28:12,974 --> 01:28:14,930
Right now, other than anything else in the world...

904
01:28:15,094 --> 01:28:19,007
... don't you wish I had finally gotten
around putting up the curtains in the bedroom?

905
01:28:20,300 --> 01:28:21,600
Shit!

906
01:28:22,134 --> 01:28:23,487
Are you alright?

907
01:28:25,494 --> 01:28:27,724
You should rinse your hands with some water.
- No, I'm fine.

908
01:28:27,894 --> 01:28:31,125
Are you sure? Let me just...
- I said I'm fine.

909
01:28:32,814 --> 01:28:35,123
You spilled your wine, Trace.

910
01:28:38,214 --> 01:28:43,766
By the by, you should know in case some
bizarre active 'God' should happen to take my life...

911
01:28:43,934 --> 01:28:48,962
... my will's been amended to direct the police
to the 10-year old son of our next door neighbour.

912
01:28:49,134 --> 01:28:51,090
What do you want?

913
01:28:52,494 --> 01:28:55,247
What does anybody want?
I want the Red Sox to win the World Series.

914
01:28:55,414 --> 01:28:57,200
You haven't taken the kid to the police.
What do you want?

915
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:59,400
I had a chat with your mom.

916
01:29:00,894 --> 01:29:05,172
Not bad looking for somebody who's
been dead for twelve years.

917
01:29:06,294 --> 01:29:10,810
What do you want, Andy ?
- I want to change my life, Tracy.

918
01:29:10,974 --> 01:29:14,649
I don't think I'm overstating when I say
that she knows some pretty cold card tricks.

919
01:29:14,814 --> 01:29:16,770
Cut the shit. What do you want?

920
01:29:18,054 --> 01:29:22,206
I want half.
What the fuck do you think I want?

921
01:29:36,615 --> 01:29:38,048
Give him the money.

922
01:29:38,450 --> 01:29:39,250
What?

923
01:29:39,814 --> 01:29:43,045
Give the man the money,
and let's get out of here.

924
01:29:43,215 --> 01:29:46,173
Oh Jesus, Jed.. I need you to focus on this thing.

925
01:29:46,335 --> 01:29:50,886
I'm telling you precisely what to do. Give the guy
the 10 bucks and we leave the country.

926
01:29:51,055 --> 01:29:55,412
I'm supposed to split the money three ways?
I'm supposed to just accept this?

927
01:29:55,575 --> 01:29:58,772
Welcome to the land where you
don't have a choice.

928
01:29:58,935 --> 01:30:02,052
Don't fucking turn on me.
I earned this money.

929
01:30:02,215 --> 01:30:06,367
This money is mine. He's not getting
a nickel. The cheque's in my name.

930
01:30:06,535 --> 01:30:08,491
Not in the prison, I doubt.

931
01:30:12,695 --> 01:30:16,449
Without the kid, he doesn't have anything.

932
01:30:16,615 --> 01:30:20,654
Without the kid, Andy is just a guy
who cracked under the strain.

933
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:21,900
What?

934
01:30:23,575 --> 01:30:25,566
Absolutely.

935
01:30:27,655 --> 01:30:31,364
Do you know what you're saying?
- What's the big deal Jed?

936
01:30:31,535 --> 01:30:36,051
You cut me open, stuck your hands
and twisted my ovaries so that I look all that dead.

937
01:30:36,215 --> 01:30:39,525
Oh, excuse me, 'necrotic'. Now you develop
some enlightened sense of what's right and wrong?

938
01:30:39,695 --> 01:30:41,048
He's a child.

939
01:30:41,215 --> 01:30:43,968
No, he's a little fucking troll who deserves
to be put out of his misery...

940
01:30:44,135 --> 01:30:47,047
... for fucking up my life.
Now if you don't have the balls to...

941
01:30:53,255 --> 01:30:55,371
Don't talk about this again.

942
01:30:57,576 --> 01:31:01,728
Anything happens to the kid and I'm
the State's star witness.

943
01:31:02,815 --> 01:31:04,771
Give the man the money.

944
01:31:09,655 --> 01:31:11,611
I'm sorry I hit you.

945
01:31:22,136 --> 01:31:23,808
Put it down.

946
01:31:25,936 --> 01:31:29,406
Which blood did you let
me lose before you saved me?

947
01:31:29,575 --> 01:31:31,200
You waited an extra minute or two, didn't you?

948
01:31:31,300 --> 01:31:33,350
You thought about going the other
way after you saw I was pregnant.

949
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:36,095
You thought for a second about
letting me die, didn't you?

950
01:31:36,255 --> 01:31:38,974
I'm a doctor.
- You were a doctor.

951
01:31:40,775 --> 01:31:42,731
Don't overestimate yourself, Tracy.

952
01:31:45,136 --> 01:31:47,127
Give me the gun.

953
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:50,200
Come on.

954
01:32:59,377 --> 01:33:01,811
It's me. I have the money.

955
01:33:02,937 --> 01:33:05,132
Where are you?
- At Market Square.

956
01:33:06,456 --> 01:33:10,051
Meet me in the northwest corner
in fifteen minutes.

957
01:35:37,098 --> 01:35:39,168
Like shooting tuna in a barrel, huh?

958
01:36:04,939 --> 01:36:07,214
I won't mind shooting you.

959
01:36:10,299 --> 01:36:11,971
What took you so long?

960
01:36:12,139 --> 01:36:17,133
We were waiting for Jed.
- Somehow, I don't think he's going to show.

961
01:36:17,299 --> 01:36:19,255
Don't move. You need a doctor.

962
01:36:21,139 --> 01:36:25,610
You hear that Trace?
We need a doctor.

963
01:37:54,500 --> 01:37:57,970
You okay?
- I will be.

964
01:38:01,460 --> 01:38:05,419
You're supposed to put ice on that.
- I don't want any ice.

965
01:38:07,020 --> 01:38:08,851
You need ice.

966
01:38:09,020 --> 01:38:13,138
Fine.
I'll have mine in a glass of some scotch.

967
01:38:13,500 --> 01:38:14,100
Fine.

968
01:38:15,300 --> 01:38:19,259
Single malt. Nothing blended.
Blended whisky is crap.

969
01:38:20,380 --> 01:38:22,940
Somebody told me that once.
