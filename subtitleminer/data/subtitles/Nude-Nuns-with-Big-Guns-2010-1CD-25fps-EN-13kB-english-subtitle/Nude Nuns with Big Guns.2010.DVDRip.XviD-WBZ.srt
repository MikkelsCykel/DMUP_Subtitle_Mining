- Who to kill?
- To all those who sin against him.

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,400
Hello.

165
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:16,800
Sorry about your father.
I think it will have to be your daddy.

166
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,520
You're cute.

167
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:26,000
- Chavo on the phone.
- Who?

168
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,040
- It's him.
- Damn! What does he want?

169
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,880
He wants to talk to you.

170
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,800
- How it sounds?
- Quite seriously.

171
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,400
I'll be back for you, Mom.

172
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:02,000
Chavez's workshop.
You're welcome, we do not care.

173
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:07,520
Father Bernardo is dead.
As Lobo and Chinaco.

174
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,120
It was a fucking massacre.

175
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,080
Have not taken anything. No money, no drugs.
It was something strictly personal.

176
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,320
Fucking.

177
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,400
Collect and manage your people.

178
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,320
Boss, we have a surprise for you.

179
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:32,000
It's not cute? I checked it.
Is not Kick Stand?

180
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,200
Sure.

181
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:37,280
- Do you want to thicken the icing?
- Yes.

182
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,480
But I can not.
We work.

183
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:54,000
Boys ... We are in the middle
a holy war.

184
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:00,000
In fact, my mother always said:

185
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,000
"If you want a sweet peach,

186
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:08,240
will have to wait to fall from the tree. "

187
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:13,840
So sweet and juicy.
Look.

188
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:22,800
Dad said:
"Acre or sweet, we need to chew."

189
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,720
Just saying.
Chavo? What are you doing?

190
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:34,010
Speak of the mother and you live
fucking with your father?

191
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,520
I said nothing.

192
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,040
If we talk of mother
gonna fly eggs.

193
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:44,721
- Chavo!
- Let's not talk about my mother.

194
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:48,083
If more than one mother says,

195
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,600
be prepared
to lose a few inches.

196
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,040
- Rigo!
- Yes.

197
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,960
- You like that?
- Yes.

198
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,120
You want me to give you?

199
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,360
- Yes.
- Okay.

200
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,280
Give it to him.

201
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:21,200
Not now. Leave me alone.

202
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,600
Shit!

203
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,960
Hello, Chavo.

204
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,600
You do a great job
taking care of my place.

205
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,400
That's a lot of money I make.

206
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,800
Listen.

207
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:45,000
It's a vigilante on the streets.
It kills bad guys.

208
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,600
In case you forgot, we are the bad guys.

209
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,600
Well.
I want to know when anyone enters the door.

210
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,800
It has been understood?

211
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,000
Go! Go!

212
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,529
Okay, okay. I deal with it.

213
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,400
My hat.

214
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,720
We witnessed how you satisfaceati
each other into the house.

215
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:43,160
Such blasphemy will not be tolerated
in my church.

216
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:29,080
- Fr Carlitos there. It's scary.
- Okay.

217
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:43,400
Why not call the police
and let's leave them to handle?

218
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,200
Jews have called for help.

219
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,400
When Moses came down from the mountain,
did not ask who is on their side.

220
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:54,800
They responded by taking weapons
the name of the Lord

221
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,200
killing those hostile to God.

222
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,320
Not spared anyone.

223
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,080
Are you ready for this?

224
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,280
Ready to go
bloody hands

225
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:08,880
to shoot and kill more priests?
I was not prepared for it.

226
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
You know what we have done?
Will continue to do so all that new.

227
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:20,000
Should be punished, Angelina.
be punished on behalf of believers.

228
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,600
Look at me.

229
00:31:24,721 --> 00:31:29,480
How can the Lord,
when I can not master their own hands?

230
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:36,160
I think not only to go back
the monastery, in my dirty cell,

231
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,400
Where can I put needles in your arm
so I can forget.

232
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,880
Mother Magda told me to die.

233
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,360
Be patient.

234
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,840
I went through this.

235
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:23,200
When I was in his hands
Lord spoke to me.

236
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:27,880
He gave me this assignment.

237
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,164
At first, I was not prepared for it.

238
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,800
I had to prepare.

239
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:40,720
- What did God say?
- They were words.

240
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:47,160
It was intense excitement of being alive
one that spoke to me.

241
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,890
How do you get rid of them?

242
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,722
God sent an angel to me
guide and defend me.

243
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:02,251
- As you protect me me now?
- Yes.

244
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,331
Now that we found each other,
We will be back a whole.

245
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:32,367
It's not easy to become a nun.

246
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:40,800
It's a life you flee
the outside world,

247
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,480
life is sacrifice.

248
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:50,600
When times become unbearable,
trust, knowing that

249
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:56,000
sacrifice that we make
is the name of our Lord

250
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,320
Jesus Christ.

251
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:06,400
When you pass through those doors,
you will be born again.

252
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:12,200
You come with nothing and you will be absolved
sins without question.

253
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:17,320
Do not ask and do not talk
about our past life.

254
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:24,080
To make a closer union
the crucifixion,

255
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,560
You will be ...

256
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:31,240
subject to the exercises and tasks
and humility.

257
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:38,280
If you doubt this process,
if you're not part of us.

258
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:44,000
<i>Mother Magda . </ i></i>

259
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:50,480
To be covered in all to death

260
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,000
the love of God.

261
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,400
You'll be perfect nun.

262
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,640
I want to dwell?

263
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:52,400
No.
I am willing to listen to the story.

264
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,960
- I'm on it.
- Could be the killer of priests.

265
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,042
The Bible is the only protection
I need.

266
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,327
God has shone all souls

267
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:40,331
taught you not to sin
and trust in his mercy.

268
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:43,603
Forgive me, Lord,
for they're about to sin.

269
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:46,849
No God
are the only tool that works through to me.

270
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,760
Tell me what's so hard on my heart

271
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,760
The confession must come to you
at this time?

272
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:57,600
I'm not here to confess my sins.
I'm here to do.

273
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:02,242
You must have courage to live in my house.

274
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:07,807
You know who you chicken?
How much money passes through this church?

275
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:11,200
To kill some priests
will not change anything.

276
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,200
- No idea who you fuck.
- Tell me who work

277
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,800
and you will not suffer
brethren who have suffered.

278
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:21,880
I work for God.
He is my pastor.

279
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,880
<i> Motel "No way"
Butch's. </ i></i>

280
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,120
<i> Located in the famed city. </ i></i>

281
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,520
Make yourself comfortable.

282
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,800
Damn.

283
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,840
Is always the same.

284
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,400
Damn. Passing.

285
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:25,122
There is nothing sacred?

286
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:32,007
No dressing. It's okay
It only takes a minute.

287
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:20,000
- We need a room.
- The hour or all night?

288
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:28,760
- All night.
- $ 30, cash.

289
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,400
Camera lucky seven.

290
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,920
Halfbreed.

291
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,281
These guys, they're yours.

292
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,371
- Okay?
- Yes.

293
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:24,220
How to count money all,
including yours?

294
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:26,360
What's your problem?
You want to count my money?

295
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,160
- I'd like to see them.
- Count them.

296
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:31,680
- Count them.
- No, that's fine. It's good.

297
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:40,800
Rigo.

298
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,564
Go to work, man.

299
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:06,000
- Chavo's workshop. Are Rigo.
- Give it to Chavo. Now!

300
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,280
Well.

301
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:16,765
- Carlitos, who?
- Bastards killed him in his church.

302
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:23,282
- I should have prayed harder.
- You need to put an end to this, right now.

303
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:27,609
Well.

304
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:32,400
If you want to finish the bastard,
will usually cost you double that.

305
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:37,480
- I have so much money.
- Father, do not play with me.

306
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:40,000
We've already lost two people
in your holy war.

307
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:44,400
In fact, I know that Jesus has deep pockets
for such nonsense.

308
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:50,000
If you pay double, I do everything
in half the usual time.

309
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:54,440
Meet with Mother Magda
Carlitos his church. You wait.

310
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:05,040
Carlitos ...

311
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:10,880
It sounds good.

312
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:27,000
On here.

313
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:34,400
You guys stay here and make sure
that we are unwelcome guests.

314
00:48:56,040 --> 00:49:00,400
- What do you think?
- I'm dead.

315
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:05,000
Can you stop?
Let's make them pay.

316
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:09,320
There are too forgiving, Magda.

317
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:14,367
Returns cheek, love your enemy ...
All the crap they teach.

318
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:19,600
Listen, I was summoned to the monastery
to fix this.

319
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:24,000
And I expect to resolve
as soon as possible.

320
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:27,560
I heard the first, right?
I know you want to solve quickly.

321
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,600
You want a miracle.

322
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,360
That's your job.

323
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:36,800
But as shown,
Your job does not work very well.

324
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,400
Now. There are witnesses?

325
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,640
Sister Mary was first told us
this situation.

326
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:52,680
- Then get it here.
- Do not use anything.

327
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:56,000
Sister Mary is here for 20 years.

328
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:00,600
I kept it here just because he knew
to keep his big mouth closed.

329
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:05,440
We'll see. Bring it.

330
00:50:58,320 --> 00:50:59,680
Who did this?

331
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Who killed him?

332
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:14,400
Well.
I ask you once beautiful.

333
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:20,000
If you do not want to talk, one to bring him
the Kick Stand, to take over the interrogation.

334
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:25,600
Who killed him?

335
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:32,000
Well.
Your choice.

336
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:37,600
I'll be back.

337
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:46,480
Mary, tell me now what you saw.

338
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:50,681
Mary what you saw?

339
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:55,920
It's okay. Well, I can say
I will not tell anyone.

340
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:59,080
Between us.

341
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:03,480
Mary will be back for you

342
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:05,800
and I can not stop.

343
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:08,640
What did you see?

344
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:16,200
Kick Stand, move over.
Now!

345
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,200
Who killed him, Mary?

346
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:33,520
You know who it was, eh?

347
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:39,720
I've seen, is not it?
Looks?

348
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:49,080
Kick Stand, get to work.

349
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:54,000
I'll crucify
as Jesus was crucified on the cross.

350
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:42,400
Kick Stand, enough.

351
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:06,800
It was a nun.

352
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:12,600
- It was God's hands.
- A nun?

353
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:19,040
It seems to be one of your penguins, Magda.

354
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:23,800
- What kind of weapon to have?
- One high.

355
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:30,280
I looked into her eyes
and saw the devil in them.

356
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:42,607
- What to do now, boss?
- First, gather the troops and then ...

357
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:48,000
we go hunting for nuns.

358
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,280
Halfbreed not fooling around and come here.

359
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:09,200
We seek a nun.

360
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:12,840
A nun with a big weapon.

361
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:16,487
I mean, big boobs big as a weapon?

362
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:20,088
I said weapons.
I'm surrounded by idiots.

363
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:24,480
Pull yourself together, or you'll end up here
in a pine coffin.

364
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,720
Spread the rumor on the streets.

365
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:52,560
Fix that. Go and check it out.

366
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:10,200
What about her?
E nun.

367
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:14,880
Yes it is.

368
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:28,080
Are you a murderer?

369
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:33,564
No, no, no. Not that.

370
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:37,200
I think he can not even take
a weapon, but to fire her.

371
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,120
Let's go.

372
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:45,000
We'll be back later after you.

373
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:44,169
S back errant daughter.

374
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:49,000
When you've found the body in Valambrosa
I thought it would not do us any trouble.

375
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:54,120
And now that you sit in front of me
I know I was right.

376
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:57,000
Your only power is in your hands.

377
00:57:57,001 --> 00:57:59,880
I know you did not last a week out.

378
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:06,160
Looking for someone?
Take a good look at him.

379
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:10,728
God punishes those
Why I serve Satan.

380
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:22,440
Let me go.

381
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:37,440
- A delivery from Magda.
- What should I do with it?

382
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:39,680
I hate the religious crap.

383
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:44,560
Magda told her to give Chavo's
and when it ends with a throw away.

384
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:47,490
- Put it there.
- Okay.

385
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:10,000
Beautiful view.

386
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:15,880
- Hi, Chavo.
- Hello, love.

387
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Tell him to bring me Beverly
some beer, please.

388
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:29,200
Come with me.

389
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:38,000
Exactly how I remember you.

390
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:43,600
- Dance for me, MAMAC?
- Of course.

391
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:48,400
Come on, come here.

392
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:03,200
Thanks, Beverly.

393
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:12,200
Listen, if you see a crazy chick like this
shoot first and then ask her who she is

394
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:13,600
These are his orders and Chavo.

395
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:20,000
- Halfbreed, want a beer?
- What the hell do you think? Yes.

396
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:27,200
I think God is trying to tell me something.
Wherever I go, I see the nuns.

397
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,800
What the hell you said earlier?

398
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:33,800
The girl in the picture. I saw the cazându
at the Palms Hotel, last evening.

399
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:37,800
It looked dirty.
I do not know, I think he has a drinking problem.

400
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:42,209
You saw this nun
cazându himself in a hotel 2 money last night?

401
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:44,520
I was with Butch.
Ask her, will tell you the same thing.

402
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:49,240
If you're wrong Beverly,
then God help you.

403
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:28,760
- What? I'm busy.
- I want to wake up and be careful.

404
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:32,800
Yes, now you have my attention.

405
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:36,200
What the hell is so important
The morning I wake up in the middle?

406
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:38,800
It's four in the afternoon, you stupid cow.

407
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:43,000
- He stayed a nun, last night?
- No.

408
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:46,480
Beverly, I'll rip your ass
when you close the phone.

409
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:50,560
Leave it the hell alone, Jesus.

410
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:54,400
It was checked last night.
We stayed at 3 o'clock one morning.

411
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:57,600
<i> Butch, it's time to play with me. </ i></i>

412
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:02,800
Room number seven.
Even I checked it.

413
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:06,600
That mutt not let go.
We are on the road.

414
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:46,489
<i>We have some irresponsible heterosexual . </ i></i>

415
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:51,208
<i>We  lesbianism, homosexuality
trans sexual </ i></i>

416
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:55,520
<i> much sexuality. All sexuality. </ I></i>

417
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:59,720
<i> All are sins.
We lesbians ...</ i></i>

418
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:29,479
She's dead?

419
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:33,405
No, but Beverly has seen the nun
cazându to the motel last night.

420
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:39,000
I want to see this heroine.
Kick Stand, go there.

421
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:42,520
Add it to me ... alive.
Go.

422
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:57,520
If not let me go now
will have to kill you.

423
01:03:57,640 --> 01:04:00,644
If you have not noticed,
I'm the one with the gun.

424
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:02,200
You do not have to go through this.

425
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:06,880
I know that God forgives sins.

426
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:12,368
- You just have to ask forgiveness.
- What do you know about sin?

427
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:15,600
You really are a true nun
or any Swindler dressed like that?

428
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:22,280
I took communion
at my church, in God's name.

429
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:27,600
You think you're so strong.
Who are you to preach?

430
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:31,000
What do you know half of sins
they condemn?

431
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:37,200
- I am a sinner.
- What are your sins, sister?

432
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:45,360
- Sin with the body.
- Big deal.

433
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:48,962
Half of you are ridden
priests.

434
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:52,402
It may be true.

435
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:55,680
My sins are not of the flesh.

436
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:00,200
But the same kind of sex.

437
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:18,603
Get back on the bed, cur.

438
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:33,560
We sin today.

439
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:39,400
And tomorrow we ask forgiveness.

440
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:50,640
That's the beauty of faith.

441
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:27,922
- Who the hell are you?
- You thought, you thought, you thought wrong.

442
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:33,320
- You said you can be forgiven.
- Want to be forgiven? Ask for forgiveness.

443
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:37,480
Please ... please.

444
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:44,120
Please ...

445
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:52,520
You graduate.

446
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:10,480
You ... graduate.

447
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:14,600
of all sins.

448
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:24,040
But there is forgiveness
for the limits of hell.

449
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:54,400
Where the hell have you been all day?
At Tate fâlfâitoare?

450
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:59,289
There is no girl there.
I say it e.

451
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:03,610
It is dressed in nun
and makes you give your pants off.

452
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:07,725
Have you seen a nun
the Tate fâlfâitoare?

453
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:12,687
- How did you stay there, you idiot?
- Pope told to stay there.

454
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:16,803
Get out of my face fucking.

455
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:26,363
- What now?
- Butch is dead.

456
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:29,848
A nun who has worked very well.

457
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:33,243
<i> Chavo will be angry. </ i></i>

458
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:39,643
Sorry, boss. But I have bad news.
Butch is dead.

459
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:44,891
- It was all messed up there, man.
- Mutt that's crazy.

460
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:48,527
Prospect says she's a nun
the Tate fâlfâitoare "right now.

461
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:51,084
Come on.

462
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:05,205
- Dance Fâlfâitoare.
- Hey, man, are Halfbreed.

463
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:10,406
- I bet that you're looking for the nun.
- Tell the Pope that Chavo is on its way.

464
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:13,364
<i> Yes, I have to wash my mutt that. </ i></i>

465
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:16,245
- What is it?
- Chavo is on its way.

466
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:20,285
Get a mutt that and clean
before it can get it here.

467
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,200
What happens Halfbreed?

468
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:33,400
Not now, cur.

469
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:42,921
Wake up!
And get dressed.

470
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:18,046
<i> heart will not let me wait. </ i></i>

471
01:10:18,160 --> 01:10:21,448
<i> I pray God to save me
and meet us. </ i></i>

472
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:25,007
<i> If not in this world
in heaven above. </ i></i>

473
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:51,287
Get your stinking hands off me.

474
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:54,571
Where's Angelina?

475
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:59,000
E Tate fâlfâitoare "
with some old friends of yours.

476
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:04,800
I had to put things right.

477
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:19,600
Kick Stand, tell him Pope
bring to a nun.

478
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,800
Hi again, ucigaso.

479
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:46,288
I know that you are not mantis
they seek.

480
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:49,927
You should do something.

481
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:55,280
- Pope leaves us less alone.
- I'll be down.

482
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:34,088
I'll also give.

483
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:46,400
Nun.

484
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:09,240
Put the gun down, softly.

485
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:33,811
Who the hell are you?

486
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:44,043
Fucking mutt!

487
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:09,291
Who the hell are you?

488
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:36,284
No, no, no, calm down.

489
01:20:36,720 --> 01:20:40,088
Yes, yes.

490
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:43,849
Do not touch anything. It's okay.

491
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:48,044
Come, go.

492
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:57,368
Are you okay?

493
01:20:57,960 --> 01:21:01,726
- I will.
- No, no, no ...

494
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:05,444
No, no.

495
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,604
No! No, no, no.

496
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:09,330
Everybody?

497
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:14,721
No. I'll handle it myself.

498
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,400
Father ...

499
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:26,920
are prepared to do this task
in God's name?
