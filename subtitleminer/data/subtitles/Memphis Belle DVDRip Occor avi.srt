Ordinary? First they volunteer for all this.

47
00:05:02,559 --> 00:05:07,268
Then they fly 24 missions without
a scratch. Doesn't sound ordinary to me.

We could do our jobs in our sleep.
Why can't they know?

118

Because I said so.

This one's shiny aluminum. Very modern.

130

This one's a little more homey,
with the brick and the little bushes.

This one. Why?

Sure they do. It's comforting.

137

CLAY: Love letters.

- Poor slob.

RASCAL: Dibs!

you'll tell me if you lose your cherry.

148
00:11:33,241 --> 00:11:34,866

that's where they're sending us tomorrow.

EUGENE: Are you sure?
RASCAL: We can't go. Our plane's broke.

VIRGE: It's fixed.
RASCAL: Let's go break it.

157

- They wouldn't send us there our last time.
- They'd send us on a milk run to France.

Are you scared?

No.

I'm Val. Come on.

- They sound wonderful.

It's been so long since I had any meat.

185
00:14:13,234 --> 00:14:17,279
I work the meat very slowly, very tenderly.
That's the secret.

186
00:14:17,363 --> 00:14:21,408
I rub in a little Worcestershire,
add garlic, a little thyme.

187
00:14:21,618 --> 00:14:25,746
Then I ease it into a patty, very gently,
so I don't bruise the meat.

188
00:14:26,122 --> 00:14:28,578
Virge, you're making me so hungry!

We're going to have to excite people
on this bond tour. Inspire them.

191

Now, Dennis is a fine man,
but he doesn't have your enthusiasm.

192
00:14:52,148 --> 00:14:54,437
I'm a qualified pilot, same as him.

193
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:56,103
They didn't have a plane ready...

194
00:14:56,194 --> 00:14:59,729
...so he's the big shot pilot
and I'm in the dummy seat.

195

You're no dummy, Luke.
We both know that.

Well, you've got nine men
who are totally depending on you.

198

What did you do before the war?
I was in the furniture business.

199

This isn't like making furniture,
see what I mean?

200

Right.

201

- No, you are.

I can't say that about many people.

211

Two-and-a-half hours? He'll never make it.

- Val, help him!
- What do you want from me?

1026
01:27:29,293 --> 01:27:32,709
He needs a hospital.
All I have is a first-aid kit.

EUGENE: Here you go, Danny.

RASCAL: What? Let's do it.

1030
01:27:47,811 --> 01:27:49,768
Put a parachute on him and push him out.

1031

- Jesus!
- It's crawling with Germans down there.

1032
01:27:52,107 --> 01:27:55,772
VAL: They'll take him to a hospital.
RASCAL: If they don't kill him for fun.

It's his only chance! Another crew did it.

1034
01:27:59,364 --> 01:28:01,902
- He was conscious.
- Danny can't pull the cord.

VAL: We can pull it first.

1036
01:28:03,535 --> 01:28:05,943
- He could fall in a lake and drown.
- Can't we wait?

1037
01:28:06,038 --> 01:28:09,122
We'll be over the North Sea in 10 minutes.
It'll be too late.

You're the doctor.

- Phil! I don't want any argument.

- Please don't do it.
- It's his only chance.

No, you're his only chance,
but you're too chicken to help him!

1046
01:28:41,990 --> 01:28:45,822
VAL: If he stays on board, he'll die.
PHIL: If you throw him out he'll die.

PHIL: You can save him!

1048

So what if you're not a doctor yet?
You can help him. I know you can.

- Nine.

1058

There's another one.

We're close to home, so lose your guns.
