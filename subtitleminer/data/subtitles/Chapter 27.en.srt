my Mom and me and all.</i>

happened to me right around last Christmas.</i>

15
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,304
<i>Those 3 days in New York City.</i>

16
00:03:04,391 --> 00:03:05,346
Listen.

17
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:10,887
You know those ducks,
the ones in Central Park?

18
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,672
Huh?

19
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:24,683
The ducks.  The ones that swim around
that lake in Central Park. Do you know it?

20
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,893
- You wanna go there?
- No.

21
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:40,471
Yeah, maybe I will. It's just in the winter
when the lake freezes, where do they go?

22
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,233
What're you saying?

23
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:48,153
What happens to them, to the ducks?
Where do they go? Where are they now?

24
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,311
You gotta be kidding me, right?

25
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:57,075
You gotta be, asking me about the ducks!

26
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,388
Alright buddy, so where do you
want me to take you? For real.

<i>Now, I didn't know
it at the time, but...</i>

28
00:04:25,619 --> 00:04:33,221

and morons.  It depressed the hell out of me.</i>

29
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,455
<i>It really did.</i>

30
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:44,406

<i>It was December and all, and I went
outside and walked a few blocks North.</i>

33
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:23,960
<i>There was this kind of a crazy
cold day. No sun out.  No wind.</i>

34
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,360
<i>Nothing.</i>

35
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,560
<i>I went up to the "Dakota"</i>

36
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,595
<i>This strange building on the
upper west-side of Manhattan.</i>

37
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,339
<i>It was like something
out of the "Wizard of Oz".</i>

38

<i>The home of the great.  The powerful.</i>

39
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,720
I'll bet you guys are
waiting for somebody, huh?

40
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,641
Hey, do you know.... is he home?

41
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,390
I don't know.

42
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,005
He's somewhere in New York City.

43
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,760
My God! I can't believe
I'm standing right here!

44
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,800
You are!

45
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:56,790
You've gotta understand - I've been a Beatles
fan since I was a kid, and John is...

46
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,543
was, the genius behind them.

47
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,840
- Do you like his new album?
- He has a new album?

48
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,480
- Yeah, silly!
- No wait, I've read about that, it's...

49
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,157
- "Double Fantasy"
- "Double Fantasy"

50
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:20,840
- It's amazing.  It's really real.
- It's flawless, really.  Flawless.

51
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:25,605
I know.  I came all the way from
Hawaii just to get his autograph.

52
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:35,354
You should buy it.  You should
buy it and ask John to sign it.

53
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,320
Yeah, sure. I will.

54
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,120
He'll love it.

55
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,960
- Hey, Jude, um... we were going, right?
- Yeah...

56
00:07:50,012 --> 00:07:52,191
Yeah.
Yeah.

57
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,600
I'm sorry, I'm Mark.

58
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,640
Mark Chapman.

59
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,736
I'm here to meet John Lennon.

60
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:21,926
<i>After awhile I left and walked over towards
Broadway. I wanted to buy the new John Lennon album.</i>

61
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,416
<i>It wasn't cheap, that's for sure.</i>

62
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:47,625
<i>But I didn't give a damn.  I get so happy when I
think about that record - even now.</i>

63
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:54,065
<i>I used to love the Beatles.
I still love the Beatles.</i>

64
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,512
<i>I swear to God,
I really do.</i>

65
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:07,681
<i>Sometimes I felt like the Beatles'
music was made just for me.</i>

66
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,005
Hey!
Alright, you got it!

67
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,682
See that? Right there, where
they're standing.  Look familiar?

68
00:09:28,931 --> 00:09:31,760
- Oh my God.
- Yeah.

69
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,520
That's here!

70
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,433
That's here!
That's right over there!

71
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,877
He stood right here!

72
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,280
Look, if Yoko was over here.

73
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,578
Pretty neat, huh?

74
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,880
You guys are pathetic.

75
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,520
We were gonna go see the
movie... a movie, later.  Hello?

76
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,360
- Do you wanna come?
- What?

77
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,800
We were gonna go see a movie
later. Do you want to come?

78
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:58,080
No, no. I hate the movies.

79
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:08,711
They're phoney.  So goddamn phoney. Look at the
actors - always clutching their foreheads

80
00:11:08,711 --> 00:11:15,304
breathing deep.  They know they're acting, how
good they are, and goddammit they're gonna show you.

81
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:21,720
No, I can't stand it.
It drives me insane.

82
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:26,400
Drives me absolutely insane,
if you wanna know the truth.

83
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,120
OK.

84
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:35,720
I know.  I can take you gals
to dinner. I mean, if you want?

85
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,400
You like Japanese food?
I've been to Japan.

86
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:43,080
- I've been all over the world.
- OK.

87
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:49,400
Great, it's settled then.  I'll take you
gals to dinner at a Japanese food restaurant.

88
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,280
My treat.

89
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,680
- Alright.
- Bye-bye.

90
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,240
Don't forget.

91
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:22,760
<i>I waited, and I waited,
for what felt like forever.</i>

92
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,200
<i>But nothing happened. No-one came.</i>

93
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:41,200
<i>I thought about waiting for that girl, the
fan.  But I knew she wouldn't come back.</i>

94
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,285
<i>No-one ever does anything
they say they will.</i>

95
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,698
<i>And it was so cold. It was scary.</i>

96
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:59,895
<i>I felt like I was disappearing
every time I crossed the street.</i>

97
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:16,360
<i>I'm too vulnerable for a world full
of pain and lies and phoniness.</i>

98
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:54,757
<i>There were these 2 obvious
homosexuals in the room next door,</i>

99
00:13:54,757 --> 00:13:57,400
<i>and they were loud,
and drunk and laughing,</i>

100
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:02,418
<i>like whatever they were doing was the
funniest goddamn thing in the world.</i>

101
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:15,526
<i>I swear to God, I was the only
normal bastard in that lousy dump.</i>

102
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,279
Help me, Devil.

103
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:32,831
Kill them. Go over there and shoot them.

104
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,480
...Don't!

105
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,267
Sleep tight, you bastards!

106
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,880
You stole my fucking
virginity. Do you understand?

107
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:08,687
I wouldn't fuck you with a dog's
dick! Not with a dog's dick!

108
00:15:08,722 --> 00:15:14,120
You ugly bitch! You cunt! I
can't take this shit any more.

109
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:20,647
- Taxi! - No, I will not. Understand me?
I will not fuck you with a dog's dick.

110
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,990
Take me some place nice. A nice hotel.

111
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:38,609
Not too expensive or
anything. Just nice.

112
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,080
No problem.

113
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,119
Hey, do you wanna stop and have
a drink with me or something?

114
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:55,240
- I got plenty of money.  I'll buy.
- No. No drinking tonight.

115
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,179
- You like rock 'n roll?
- Yeah.

116
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,856
- Do you like Beatles' music?
- Yeah.

117
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:20,680
Well, I have to tell you something.
I'll just have to blurt this out.

118
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:24,240
...I was at a recording session tonight.

119
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,760
With John Lennon and Paul McCartney.

120
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:33,300
They recorded an album together.
They recorded for 3 hours straight.

121
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:36,895
...I'm the engineer.

122
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:44,360
They met me, and they told
me how much they like my work.

123
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:52,776
To me, it's just so ecstatic to think
that John Lennon and Paul McCartney would

124
00:16:54,040 --> 00:17:00,587
tell me how great they think my
work is. You know, from them to me

125
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,320
...everything, it all just...

126
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,520
...I just had to tell you that.

127
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:21,962
<i>The cabbie told me that Jimmy Carter stayed
at that hotel.  And when he was president, too.</i>

128
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:28,410
<i>He told me he did it to show
everyone what a regular guy he was.</i>

129
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:35,515
<i>I thought that was hysterical.  The President
staying at a regular hotel like this.</i>

130
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,555
<i>That cracked me up.</i>

131
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:47,312
<i>I had a little bit of dough, but not so much
that I could stay in a place like that forever.</i>

132
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:52,500
<i>Goddamn money.  It always ends
up depressing the hell out of you.</i>

133
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,880
<i>Very soon, he will leave his home.</i>

134
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:07,860
<i>If he stays outside and is not
frightened by his shadow...</i>

135
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,680
<i>that will be my sun.</i>

136
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:18,161
<i>- But if his shadow frightens him?
- 6 more weeks of winter!</i>

137
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:29,360
<i>I've got to keep that castle snowbound.
Please Sir, don't take him away.  Not yet.</i>

138
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:39,628
<i>When she gives me a certain
sign, I know it's my fight too.</i>

139
00:18:39,663 --> 00:18:40,560
<i>What sign, Sir?</i>

140
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:02,920
- Steve.  How you doing?
- I'm doing fine, and how'd you know my name?

141
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,480
You don't remember me?

142
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:12,240
I was here a little over a month ago.
From Hawaii?

143
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,080
- I was here to see John Lennon?
- Nope.

144
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,480
Okay, well, uh...

145
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,920
Last time, I didn't do it.

146
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,760
Get to meet him, I mean.

147
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,560
But I'm back.

148
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,560
Do you know is he, uh...

149
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:57,080
- Is he home?
- Actually I think he might be out of town.

150
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:16,440
- You mind if I wait and see?
- Be my guest. But, uh, step back a bit.

151
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:31,445
<i>I gave a great deal of myself to what John Lennon
had said, and sung about, and told us all to do.</i>

152
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:40,320
<i>His music and his lyrics provided
me with everything I needed.</i>

153
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,560
<i>What I really love
about a song, or a book</i>

154
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:48,120
<i>...if it's really good.  I mean if
the writer is really talking to you.</i>

155
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,840
<i>Then you feel like they're this
really great friend of yours</i>

156
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,574
<i>and you can just call them up
on the phone whenever you want.</i>

157
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,822
<i>Everyone needs something.
To find something.</i>

158
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,120
<i>Everyone is cracked and broken.</i>

159
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,640
<i>You have to find something to fix you.</i>

160
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:32,520
<i>To give you what you need.
To take you away</i>

161
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,360
<i>and make you whole.</i>

162
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,793
I'm getting it for the articles.

163
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,760
Anything else?

164
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,560
Yes.

165
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,680
This.

166
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,080
I'm gonna be meeting him soon.

167
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,880
<i>I went and read that
article on John Lennon.</i>

168
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:40,000
<i>It said all he ate was sushi and sashimi</i>

169
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:46,654
<i>and "Hershey's" bars with almonds.
And that he smoked French cigarettes.</i>

170
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:50,520
<i>And when they asked if the Beatles
would ever get back together, he said</i>

171
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:55,520
<i>just because a whole pile of dummies missed it the
first time, he shouldn't have to be crucified again.</i>

172
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,760
<i>He shouldn't have to
walk on water again.</i>

173
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,706
<i>He said he shouldn't have to define
the fish for the multitudes again.</i>

174
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:11,418
<i>He really said all that.  And here
he was living this sumptuous life.</i>

175
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:17,990
<i>Imagine no possessions.
The bastard had millions.</i>

176
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:26,018
<i>Yachts, farms, countryside estates
and who the hell knows what else?</i>

177
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,200
<i>He turned his back on everyone.</i>

178
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,787
<i>That was a tremendous
confirmation for me.</i>

179
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:56,016
<i>I started to think maybe I
should get a woman for the night.</i>

180
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:09,120
<i>In case I wouldn't be able
to again for a long time.</i>

181
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,904
Do you have anybody exotic?

182
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,897
A woman from another country.

183
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,480
I don't want her to talk much.

184
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:27,376
I want her to be quiet.  I'll
tip her well if she doesn't talk.

185
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,120
You don't have to be nervous.

186
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:47,533
I'm not a weirdo.  I just wanted to
be in the company of a woman tonight.

187
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:00,500
I think tomorrow will be
a very rough day for me.

188
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,633
You want, you want a massage?

189
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:37,777
Take off your dress and get into bed.

190
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,717
Can we put on the radio?

191
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,760
I like your dress.

192
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,560
I like the colour.

193
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,720
<i>Some things are hard to remember.</i>

194
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,225
<i>I'm thinking now, when the woman left</i>

195
00:28:13,328 --> 00:28:15,690
<i>I just wanted to kill myself.</i>

196
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:20,630
<i>I thought about just throwing
myself out the goddamn window.</i>

197
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:31,084
I'd like to make a
collect call to Hawaii.

198
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:36,602
OK, sir, one moment please. Who shall I say is calling?
- Holden Caulfield.

199
00:28:36,637 --> 00:28:39,120
One moment, Mr Caulfield.

200
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:46,032
- Hey, is that you?
- Hi. - Hey.

201
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:55,163
I know I said I wasn't gonna
call but uh, well, you know me

202
00:28:56,342 --> 00:28:58,585
I'm always changing my plans.

203
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:03,619
<i>It's OK, I'm glad you
called. Really glad.</i>

204
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:11,903
- You sound like you're doing OK.
- I am, I'm OK.  I finished your book.

205
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,560
Very good.

206
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:20,760
<i>- Did you like it?
- It was good.  It was really good.</i>

207
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:27,031
<i>It was very sweet.  It reminds me
of you.  The way your mind works.</i>

208
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,320
I like it, too.

209
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:36,271
How was your party?  The one that
you were going to on Saturday night?

210
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,059
<i>It was fun.</i>

211
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:45,441
I'm sorry I didn't wish you a happy party. I just
wasn't thinking about things like that before I left.

212
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,234
<i>It's OK, I know. I know
you. You're my husband.</i>

213
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:57,437
It's getting so late here. I
just... I can't seem to get to sleep!

214
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:03,080
<i>Well I just got into bed
and I'm reading my bible.</i>

215
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:07,545
<i>Maybe you should try working
on your problems one at a time.</i>

216
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:12,293
<i>Maybe the first one should be
getting back with Christ again.</i>

217
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:17,360
<i>And after that you can just ask
him for his help with the others.</i>

218
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,400
<i>Hello?</i>

219
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:32,320
Yes, I agree.  My little bible
is on the nightstand right now.

220
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,234
<i>Good.  That's good.</i>

221
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:44,280
Remember what I told you...
the night before I left?

222
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:49,289
<i>Sort of, I do. I was asleep.</i>

223
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:56,798
I told you that I loved
you. I love you very much.

224
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:02,240
<i>- More than anyone else.
- I love you, too.</i>

225
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,200
You're my gemstone.

226
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,800
Goodbye, Gloria.

227
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,760
<i>OK.  OK.
Goodbye.</i>

228
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:52,788
I'm going to kill John Lennon.

229
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:31,073
<i>This isn't like last time.
Something's going to happen.</i>

230
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,000
<i>This is happening.</i>

231
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:12,998
<i>That morning, everything had changed.</i>

232
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,683
<i>It just felt different.</i>

233
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,600
<i>And I knew...</i>

234
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:33,919
<i>I knew in my bones I would
never see my hotel room again.</i>

235
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:42,240
<i>I laid out the few possessions
I had managed to keep.</i>

236
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,200
<i>Just all the things
that meant something.</i>

237
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:54,240
<i>A letter of commendation for my
work with Vietnamese children.</i>

238
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:59,240
<i>My passport, and a couple of photographs
from my trip around the world.</i>

239
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:05,160
<i>What was left of my life.</i>

240
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:06,727
<i>It was all so that when they came, the
Police or whoever it was going to be...</i>

241
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,808
<i>when everyone would
want to know who I was.</i>

242
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,815
<i>Who I had become.</i>

243
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:25,014
<i>And maybe if I found myself
unable to speak or something...</i>

244
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:30,322
<i>this would tell them who I was before.</i>

245
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,880
I am...

246
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,400
Holden.

247
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:39,411
<i>I'm going now. Becoming something new.</i>

248
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:52,254
<i>Hey, listen. You know
those ducks? The taxi.</i>

249
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:56,920
<i>She had a teeny voice. And the
prostitute with the green dress...</i>

250
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:00,999
<i>This isn't like last time.
The old man carried my bag.</i>

251
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:07,024
No, this is different. I can
feel it. Something will catch me.

252
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:11,341
<i>This is not a coincidence.
I'll be in a big field of rye.</i>

253
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,240
Good morning.  Do you know if
John Lennon's gonna come out today?

254
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:25,040
I've got his new album here. I
was hoping to get his autograph.

255
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,080
I can't help you.

256
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:35,292
Look, I understand. I know how it is.
I've been waiting for 2 days already.

257
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:38,823
I really wanted to meet him, y'know?

258
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:46,405
I'm not the regular door-man here, so
I don't know much about John Lennon.

259
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:52,347
I knew it... I knew it! I knew
it was something like that!

260
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,316
You see, this is my second time here.

261
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:02,866
Last time I thought I'd met all the
door-men. Thought I'd met them all.

262
00:41:02,901 --> 00:41:05,742
Well, sure, I thought
I'd seen them all, but...

263
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:12,261
I've been waiting a long time.

264
00:41:22,043 --> 00:41:22,892
Look.

265
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:26,957
He may have left
earlier, before I came on.

266
00:41:26,957 --> 00:41:29,080
Somebody told me he left.

267
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,880
- John Lennon?
- Uh-huh.

268
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:35,956
- John Lennon? You're serious,
you're not joking? - No.

269
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,320
Do you know where he went? Do
you know when he's gonna be back?

270
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:48,181
- Do you? Do you?
- No, I don't.

271
00:41:48,553 --> 00:41:49,448
No.

272
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,560
Thank you.

273
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,560
He's here.

274
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,480
<i>It says it was a Monday.
A Monday and all...</i>

275
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:29,040
<i>pretty near Christmas. This
is it! It's real this time.</i>

276
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:35,200
<i>This is not a coincidence. I'm going
to be with you, Holden.  In the rye.</i>

277
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:43,477
<i>I'll just disappear into the ink
of the book. No, that won't happen.</i>

278
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:47,520
<i>That's a non-reality.
But something will...</i>

279
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:52,349
<i>I'll go into the field...
Something is going to happen...</i>

280
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:59,213
<i>Like in the womb.  Maybe I'll be deaf.
A deaf mute, and I'll never speak again.</i>

281
00:42:59,248 --> 00:43:01,600
<i>I tried to be a good person...</i>

282
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:04,640
<i>I can see it. It's all over, Holden.</i>

283
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:09,480
<i>I'm taking a stand now. And
the whole world will know.</i>

284
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,560
<i>A man with stillness and
blackness all around him.</i>

285
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:17,800
<i>A man who would no longer do
anything for anybody any more.</i>

286
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:23,760
<i>A man refusing to have
anything to do with the world.</i>

287
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,400
<i>And the world would never intrude.
- Hey, buddy!</i>

288
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:30,160
- What?
- You see him?!

289
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:34,320
- What?
- Mr Lennon! He just came inside!

290
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,240
He just came in.
You didn't see him?

291
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:44,000
I guess it wasn't meant to be.

292
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:49,715
- I'll just have to keep waiting.
- Yeah, you wait him out.

293
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:52,680
It's OK.

294
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:59,920
Don't worry. (It's still OK).
It wasn't meant to happen.

295
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:07,320
When the time is right, it'll
happen.  It won't be long.

296
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:13,655
<i>Some very serious thoughts
came into my mind, of leaving...</i>

297
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:17,160
<i>abandoning the idea of going
back to the hotel, checking out...</i>

298
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:20,720
<i>getting a cab to the airport,
and flying the hell out of there.</i>

299
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:25,800
<i>I would talk myself out of it and then say
"Go, now! Before it gets a hold of you again."</i>

300
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,760
Hey, Mark. Don't make it bad.

301
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,000
Hey, Jude!

302
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:41,142
- Do you...
- Do you mind?

303
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:45,249
I wanna sit facing.

304
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,680
Oh, you wanna sit here.

305
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:54,202
So I can keep my eye out.

306
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:00,480
- Just in case.
- Sure.

307
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:05,920
- So, the other night...
- Oh, no, no, no...

308
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:11,203
- Jeri and I were waiting for you.
- Oh.

309
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:16,800
And then she wanted to go.
But, of course, I wanted to stay.

310
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:27,687
And then, I wanted to go, and we were gonna go.
As we were leaving a cab pulled up, it was John!

311
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:34,720
Anyway, he talked to us for a bit. Jeri
bummed one of his cigarettes. It was great.

312
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,640
I've read they're French.

313
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:00,179
So... do you like New York?

314
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:08,240
- I guess that's a "no".
- Oh, no, no, no, it's OK.

315
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:15,200
It's just...I mean...
kind of dirty sometimes.

316
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:22,624
It's nothing like Hawaii!
Hawaii is... Hawaii is amazing.

317
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:28,280
- I'll bet.
- Hawaii changed my life. It really did.

318
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:39,559
When I first got out there, I was...
You know, I thought I was a dud.

319
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:46,680
Hawaii saved my life.

320
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:53,780
You know, I'd really like to go
there some time. But I don't think...

321
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:56,520
No, no, no. Don't ever say that!

322
00:46:57,521 --> 00:46:59,521
Don't ever say anything like that.

323
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:00,800
What?

324
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:05,928
You can do anything.  If you set
your mind to it, you can do anything!

325
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:11,200
The Human mind...

326
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:17,025
The Human mind is an incredible thing.

327
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:25,563
Once it's mind is made
up, it can do anything.

328
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,560
- Then maybe I'll go.
- No, not maybe...

329
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:34,080
you've got to decide in
your mind that you will.

330
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:38,680
- OK, I will.
- You've got to say it.

331
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:40,600
You've got to know it.

332
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,360
Say it.

333
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Someday I will go to Hawaii.

334
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:57,040
Very good.

335
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:04,055
Very good.  It's like I told
my mother, before I left...

336
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:07,720
I knew I was gonna do something big.

337
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:10,788
I just didn't know if it
was gonna be good or bad.

338
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:14,360
What do you mean?

339
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:20,017
What do you mean by that?

340
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:30,400
Do you wanna go some place
with me? You and me...

341
00:48:30,401 --> 00:48:33,401
we could just leave, right now.
Just go, just get out of here!

342
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:36,560
- Right now, what do you say?
- Right now?

343
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,600
- We can't just leave right now.
- Why the hell not?

344
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:46,920
Yeah, we could... plan
a day trip or something.

345
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:51,960
- You know, she took me out the way there.
- No, no, no.  Not like that.

346
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:58,680
Then there'd be cabs, and elevators
and all that crap! We have to go now!

347
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:02,960
I... I have stuff to do.

348
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:15,040
Just forget it. I don't even
know why the hell I said it.

349
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,560
We're not gonna go anywhere.

350
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:23,440
But you should remember me.

351
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,160
You should.

352
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:49,200
Hey, shouldn't we be closer?
How come you never wait inside?

353
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:55,240
Sometimes it's good not to be right
there. You know, there when they come out.

354
00:49:55,680 --> 00:50:00,520
Some of the best times, when
John is leaving Central Park...

355
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:05,656
there's this coffee shop that he
goes to.  Shows that he's real.

356
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:11,320
See that guy right there? That's
John's assistant, Frederic.

357
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:13,560
- Who, him?
- Yeah.

358
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,200
Frederic!

359
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:27,120
God dammit!

360
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:31,560
Well I hope he comes out in focus this
time.  Last time was a little blurry.

361
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:33,990
You know, I got a darkroom.

362
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:38,240
I tried to catch him but he saw
me, he went inside. He got away.

363
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:41,040
This is my friend.  He's
a Beatles fan from Hawaii.

364
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:44,000
Oh, hey, Hawaii! Cool,
man. How's it hanging?

365
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:48,040
- Paul.
- Paul's a photographer.

366
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:52,960
- Trying to catch somebody?
- That fellow is John Lennon's assistant.

367
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:54,600
Oh, Freddy.

368
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:59,960
You should meet him.

369
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:03,160
I'm just here to get
John Lennon's autograph.

370
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,680
So, you gonna do any touristy stuff?

371
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:14,542
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I'm not gonna do that.

372
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:18,360
- No.
- You know why they call it the building of Dakota?

373
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:20,840
Because when it was first
built in the 1800's...

374
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:22,520
there was nothing up
here. It was just farm.

375
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:25,680
And they were like "If you lived up here
you might as well be living in Dakota."

376
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:30,280
I don't even think there was a South
or North Dakota yet.  Just territory.

377
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:33,400
They also shot "Rosemary's Baby" here.

378
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:34,960
The movie?

379
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:39,320
No, the baby.  Yeah the movie!
They shot it here in the "Dakota".

380
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:43,920
Really?

381
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:49,560
- I thought you didn't like movies?
- Some I like.  Some are OK.

382
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:52,600
"The Wizard of Oz" is wonderful.

383
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:55,840
"Rosemary's Baby" is pretty good
I guess.  It's not too phoney.

384
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:57,360
I didn't like that movie.

385
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:00,800
Why? Because it says everyone who
lives in the "Dakota" worships Satan?

386
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:06,280
Well, yes. Also because it's very slow
moving. Nothing happens until the end...

387
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:08,200
Yeah, Jude, but that's Polanski.

388
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:11,760
- Yeah, well, then I don't...
- Wait a minute...

389
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,320
that's the guy, Charles
Manson, killed his wife.

390
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:18,720
- Right?
- Sharon Tate.

391
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:23,080
- Yeah, she was pregnant too.
- And beautiful.

392
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:25,170
"Helter Skelter"

393
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:37,160
John Lennon lives in a building where
a film about Satan coming to Earth...

394
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:44,880
and the director whose wife and child
were killed because of a song John Lennon

395
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:52,277
Oh my God.  This is not a
coincidence.  Today's the day.

396
00:52:52,893 --> 00:52:55,094
Today is the day.

397
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:58,800
That's a way of looking at it!

398
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:02,200
No coincidence.

399
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,880
Hey, uh, where did you
say you were from again?

400
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:10,873
- What?
- You don't sound like you're from Hawaii.

401
00:53:10,908 --> 00:53:12,744
<i>What? He knows.</i>

402
00:53:13,457 --> 00:53:14,565
<i>He knows.</i>

403
00:53:14,565 --> 00:53:15,701
<i>Get him!</i>

404
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:18,840
- Why would you ask me that?
- Take it easy. I was only asking.

405
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:22,080
Why would you ask me
something like that?

406
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:25,200
You don't sound like you're from Hawaii

407
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,200
Why would you say something like that?

408
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,720
- Why would you ask me?
- Forget it, man!

409
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:31,904
Forget it! It's just a question, man!

410
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:39,655
Did you see him?  Did you see that?

411
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:46,478
I gotta go. I should probably go.

412
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:05,014
Hello.  Hi, Sean.

413
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,040
Is he your friend?

414
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:16,240
Oh, he's a Beatles' fan from Hawaii.

415
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:20,267
- Hoping to get John's autograph.
- It's nice to meet you.

416
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:22,935
This is Helen, Sean's Nanny.

417
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:27,455
And this is the little
heartbreaker.  This is Sean.

418
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:28,981
Hi, Sean!

419
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:40,040
I flew all the way across the ocean, from
Hawaii, and it's an honour to meet you.

420
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:41,560
Mr Lennon.

421
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:45,840
You'd better take care
of that runny nose...

422
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:48,467
you wouldn't wanna get
sick in this Christmas.

423
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:53,000
- Well it's time for us to go.
- Bye-bye.

424
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:55,577
Wave goodbye to Jude.

425
00:54:57,144 --> 00:54:58,255
Bye, you.  See you soon.

426
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,223
I hope you get your autograph.

427
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,600
Have a good day.

428
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:10,360
- John and Yoko must be so proud.
- Yeah.

429
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:14,800
Well, I hope you get your record
signed, and I hope you listen to it...

430
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:18,386
You're not gonna leave yet, are
you?  We haven't even seen John.

431
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:22,760
Yeah, I know.  But it was good
seeing you again.  I gotta go.

432
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,960
- Thanks, but you should stay.
- I'd love to, but I can't.

433
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:30,275
- Then stay.
- No, I'm tired.

434
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:31,800
- Wait, wait.
- I really should get home.

435
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:35,920
Just a little bit longer.  I know he's
gonna come out, I know it. I know it.

436
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:40,080
- Maybe some other time.
- But I know he's gonna come out.

437
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:44,320
- He's got to.  You know?
- I'm sorry, I can't.

438
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:45,842
- Please?
- Good luck.

439
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:48,280
Please? Wait.

440
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,480
I said "wait"!

441
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,160
<i>It's over.</i>

442
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:24,280
<i>It was like this crazy
stage had been set up...</i>

443
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:31,115
<i>and all the actors were coming
and going. I was merely an image.</i>

444
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:34,720
<i>A tin man playing the Beatles' fan.</i>

445
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:37,594
<i>Playing an autograph seeker.</i>

446
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:42,760
<i>And underneath I was a
boiling cauldron of rage.</i>

447
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,800
<i>But no-one could tell a goddamn thing.</i>

448
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:53,080
<i>Soon all the other actors would
leave, and I would be all alone.</i>

449
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:08,148
I guess it's down to just us
die hard Beatle-holics, huh?

450
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:12,881
Listen, about my behaviour earlier...

451
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:19,520
It's just I was told you can never
be too careful in New York City.

452
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:21,718
I really am sorry.

453
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:34,383
- It's alright. It's fine.
- Thank you. Thank you.

454
00:57:34,418 --> 00:57:38,262
I didn't want to be waiting
out here all by myself.

455
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:43,840
What the hell? You start a conversation with
a guy, and out of nowhere you get hostile.

456
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:49,594
I'm just testy I guess.  I've
been waiting out here for 3 days.

457
00:57:50,338 --> 00:57:51,628
Great.

458
00:57:55,720 --> 00:58:00,206
Maybe it's all those stories I've heard.

459
00:58:01,127 --> 00:58:05,180
You know, you never know
who you're talking to.

460
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:12,646
You're gonna bend your album there.
Nobody's gonna steal that here.

461
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:27,221
Hey, Jose! How are
you?  You remember me?

462
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:32,500
Yes, you're from Hawaii.
John Lennon, right?

463
00:58:32,788 --> 00:58:37,731
- That's me, the Beatles' fan.
- All that way, again?

464
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:41,728
Do you know Paul?
Paul, do you know Jose?

465
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:44,195
Yeah, I know him.

466
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:50,000
That's the guy who dresses in the maintenance
uniform, sneaks into my building and takes pictures.

467
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:54,240
Shame on you. These
are private individuals.

468
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,000
- Did you know he makes money from this?
- No!

469
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:00,640
- Sure.
- Who they pay for?

470
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:05,160
John Lennon, obviously.
Yoko, too. Gilda Radner.

471
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:09,480
Roberta Flack. Lauren
Bacall. Paul Simon.

472
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:12,360
That's so strange. You know how...

473
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:18,475
when you see people for the first time, even
though you know you've seen them before, it's...

474
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:23,240
and then John Lennon must be the
most famous person in the world...

475
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:26,048
and I've never seen him!

476
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:30,920
Do you remember what I told
you last time? Do you remember?

477
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:34,960
"I was definitely going to meet  John
Lennon." That's what I said. Definitely.

478
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:38,400
- I said "definitely".
- I remember.

479
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:43,460
I'm back. I flew all the way back,
I've spared no expense, I'm ready.

480
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:46,160
I've got his new album here.

481
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:51,636
I've even got a new pen.

482
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:53,878
Great.

483
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,320
You got your book!

484
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:01,840
This isn't just a book.

485
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:08,706
This is everything.

486
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:13,720
Never read it. Was supposed
to. It's about some kid, right?

487
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:17,618
- Yeah, Holden Caulfield.
- What happens?

488
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:24,600
This young fellow...

489
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:31,472
he leaves school, he runs away...

490
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:43,313
and goes on this 3 day journey through
Manhattan, in a sense, to find himself.

491
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:50,498
But he doesn't find anything
but a bunch of phoniness...

492
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:55,200
What makes it so great? I mean
that's it? How does it end?

493
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:57,920
It doesn't matter how it ends.

494
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:04,720
He's in a mental institution, and...

495
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:10,240
he's...telling us this story.

496
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:16,959
That's where he's talking
to us, in retrospect.

497
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:21,898
- Just... just read it.
- Yeah.

498
01:01:42,872 --> 01:01:44,062
John coming out?

499
01:01:50,008 --> 01:01:51,546
There he is!

500
01:01:52,958 --> 01:01:55,138
Sorry, Sir, but your
limo has yet to arrive.

501
01:02:20,287 --> 01:02:21,799
What are you waiting for? There he is!

502
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:44,240
Have you got a pen?

503
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:46,560
Thanks.

504
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:02,040
Is that all you want?

505
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:09,723
- Yeah, thanks.
- Are you sure? That's all?

506
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:14,602
Yeah, that's all.

507
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:18,794
- Thanks, John.
- You're welcome.

508
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:34,064
<i>That was really him. He spoke to me.</i>

509
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:41,758
<i>You know he wasn't real.</i>

510
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:47,229
- Looks like you scored big time!
- Wow, he put the date on it and everything!

511
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:51,929
Big stars don't usually don't put the dates
on things, do they? When they sign them?

512
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:58,066
- No, I don't think they do.
- Wow, this is really really unique.

513
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:01,504
Yeah, I'm saying now what you
got to do is get it framed.

514
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:06,120
- You... you were taking pictures?
- Right here.

515
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:11,880
Did you take one of me and John? Did
you? Did you take one of me and John?!

516
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:13,520
I think I might've!

517
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:20,507
Oh my God, I'd do
anything for that picture.

518
01:04:20,933 --> 01:04:27,694
- I'd give you 50 dollars for it.
- OK, man. Calm down.

519
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:34,452
Can I get it tonight? Come on, I
have to have it tonight. I have to!

520
01:04:34,452 --> 01:04:37,200
I don't know about tonight. I
live in Jersey, it's kinda far.

521
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:41,958
Well how about tomorrow? I'll meet you right
here and I'll give you 50 dollars for it.

522
01:04:41,958 --> 01:04:44,040
I swear to God I will.

523
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:45,800
Yeah, OK.

524
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:51,355
Then say it. Say it.

525
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:54,840
Come on, say it, "tomorrow".

526
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:58,642
Yeah, tomorrow, I'll meet you here.

527
01:04:58,849 --> 01:05:01,455
And I'll give you 50 dollars
for the photo of John Lennon.

528
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:09,025
Wait until they see this back home!

529
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:12,933
I dunno how they're gonna believe it...

530
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:19,090
- but they'll have to!
- I guess so.

531
01:05:19,484 --> 01:05:23,916
Hey, Jose, look what
I got. You see that?

532
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:28,564
Very nice, congratulations!

533
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:34,320
- You did it.
- Thank you. I knew it, I knew it. You remember?

534
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:36,480
Good for you.

535
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:41,323
Hey, Fred, check this out!

536
01:05:41,358 --> 01:05:45,800
This guy came all the way from Hawaii and
got John to sign his album. Check it out!

537
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:48,970
Congratulations, man. That's great.

538
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:56,136
- Hey, thanks for stopping!
- Do you know when they'll be back?

539
01:05:56,171 --> 01:05:57,663
Take it easy, Jose.

540
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:02,806
They have to come back tonight, right?
What time do you think they will?

541
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:07,480
It's hard to say. If they just went to
dinner they'll be back in about an hour...

542
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:11,080
but if they went to the studio,
then they could be gone all night.

543
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:16,227
- OK.
- I'm thinking they probably went to the studio.

544
01:06:16,262 --> 01:06:20,520
In fact, I'm sure of it. So...
congratulations. Good night.

545
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:23,960
- Don't leave yet.
- Why not?

546
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:28,280
They could be back any minute!
What if John forgot something?

547
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:29,920
What if I'm gonna go?

548
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:37,069
Don't... don't... Look, they'll
be back before midnight. I know it.

549
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:42,759
Look. I'm coming back tomorrow,
with your photo, alright?

550
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:50,990
Good. You got a real primo autograph
from John Lennon. Go get some rest.

551
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:59,611
- Just a little longer, please?
- I'm going home!

552
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:04,623
I know I flew off the handle earlier,
you just can never be too careful, y'know?

553
01:07:04,749 --> 01:07:08,435
- It's OK.
- You were right! You were right!

554
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:10,769
<i>Take the autograph and go!</i>

555
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:13,720
I'm not from Hawaii. I'm
from Georgia, originally...

556
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:17,760
I grew up in a suburb just outside
of Atlanta. Decatur, Georgia.

557
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,720
- That's great, man.
- I should've said something earlier...

558
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:24,760
- I guess it was the southern accent, huh?
- Yeah that's it. It was the southern accent.

559
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:29,670
Come on, come on, come on. Wait with me.
Wait with me. Just wait a little while.

560
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:31,800
No.

561
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:36,920
Just you and me.

562
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:41,976
I know, I'll take the
pictures this time.

563
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:45,505
<i>If you have a camera, you
won't be able to shoot him!</i>

564
01:07:45,844 --> 01:07:50,751
<i>He has to stay. Get him to stay!</i>

565
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:54,159
<i>If you're taking pictures,
you can't pull out a gun!</i>

566
01:07:54,306 --> 01:07:58,544
I'll take your picture with John Lennon!
I bet you never had that before, huh?

567
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:02,960
- No, I didn't. Hey, good night.
- He'll be back before midnight!

568
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:08,518
I know it! I know he will!

569
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:16,908
Hey, what if you never see him again?

570
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:20,346
What if he goes to Spain or something?

571
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:26,576
What if something happens to him?

572
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:49,188
<i>I can see it... he was sitting on the
sofa, and knowing what almost happened.</i>

573
01:08:49,360 --> 01:08:52,225
<i>Knowing that you could have done it.</i>

574
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:57,040
<i>Do it, you liar.</i>

575
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:11,347
You had your album signed, just go.

576
01:09:11,601 --> 01:09:14,969
Get in the next taxi and
just go, go, go, go, go!

577
01:09:15,430 --> 01:09:19,401
<i>Don't do it. That's
not what we're here for!</i>

578
01:09:19,739 --> 01:09:24,473
He signed your record, and he was nice. Put
the date on it and everything. He was kind.

579
01:09:24,789 --> 01:09:29,800
<i>But I wanna kill him. He's
mine. I want him. Help me, Devil.</i>

580
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:32,840
<i>Give me the power.</i>

581
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:38,445
<i>You have to, have to, have
to, have to. I want to.</i>

582
01:09:40,118 --> 01:09:42,021
<i>God, no! God, no!</i>

583
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:48,530
You're nobody, you're
nothing! He wasn't phoney.

584
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:54,320
<i>Just get in the taxi.
You coward. You phoney.</i>

585
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:56,640
You got your autograph...

586
01:09:56,880 --> 01:10:00,217
Go home, frame it. Put it on
the wall. Put it on the wall!

587
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,600
<i>Don't listen to them.</i>

588
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:08,644
<i>There's no place like
home. Come on. Come on.</i>

589
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:41,759
<i>The phoney must die, says
the catcher in the rye.</i>

590
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:00,388
I will do it.

591
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:08,096
If you give me the
opportunity, I will do it.

592
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:17,286
Yes.

593
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:51,400
Mr Lennon?

594
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:40,000
<i>That's all I wanna tell you about.</i>

595
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:46,840
<i>We have arrested Mark David Chapman...
for the homicide of John Lennon.</i>

596
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:51,560
<i>Today, multitudes mourn the shocking
and untimely death of a legend.</i>

597
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:58,200
<i>The tragic slaying of John Lennon spawned an
unimaginable sense of grief among those of every age.</i>

598
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:03,600
<i>Mark David Chapman, the
alleged killer of John Lennon...</i>

599
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:06,107
<i>has been taken to "Bellevue Hospital"...</i>

600
01:14:06,107 --> 01:14:10,534
<i>where he will remain under close watch, as
he has known to have attempted suicide before.</i>

601
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:13,560
I could tell you about how they...

602
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:19,003
took me down to the police station, and
paraded me in front of the media and all...

603
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:24,538
and how they put me in this
goddamn place, and how...

604
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:34,100
things got really crazy for awhile, but I'm
not interested in any of that stuff anymore.

605
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:38,066
It's not important.

606
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:44,434
I think John Lennon, personally for me, stood
as a symbol of leave and peace on the planet.

607
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:51,106
I think of John Lennon as an artist,
and he belongs to my generation.

608
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:54,754
And I don't understand
why he was killed.

609
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:57,240
They keep asking me...

610
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:02,820
if I really think I am
the catcher in the rye.

611
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:11,623
It's such a stupid question.
It's dumb. I swear to God it is.

612
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:21,040
I know no matter what anybody says,
I have the strength and knowing.

613
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:25,440
<i>The paragraphs and sentences of that
book were flowing through my brain...</i>

614
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:32,200
<i>and entering my blood, and
flowing to my thoughts, my actions.</i>

615
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:38,405
<i>My very soul is breathing between
the pages of "The Catcher in the Rye".</i>

616
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:42,643
<i>I was there for 3 days.</i>

617
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:48,780
<i>And it was a Monday...
pretty near Christmas.</i>

618
01:15:55,832 --> 01:15:57,200
<i>In New York City.</i>

619
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:02,480
And now I'm here.

620
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:08,160
Sitting right here...

621
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:12,314
talking... to you.

622
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:58,819
