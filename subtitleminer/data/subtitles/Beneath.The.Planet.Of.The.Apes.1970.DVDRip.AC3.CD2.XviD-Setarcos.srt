O God,

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,000
bless, we pray You,
our great army

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,520
and its supreme commander

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,600
on the eve ofa holy war

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,360
undertaken for Your sake,

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,720
and grant,

7
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,960
in the name of your Prophet,

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,880
our great Lawgiver,

9
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,640
that we, Your chosen servants,

10
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,960
created and born
in Your divine image,

11
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,360
may aspire the more perfectly

12
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,360
to that spiritual Godliness

13
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,880
and bodily beauty

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,760
which You, in Your infinite mercy,

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,080
have thought fit to deny
to our brutish enemies!

16
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,040
So be it.

17
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,640
There they go,

18
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,520
Dr. Zaius trotting
along beside them.

19
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,320
Don't be too hard
on the old boy, Zira.

20
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,760
His motives are honest.

21
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,160
He has only one motive..
to keep things

22
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,960
exactly as
they have always been.

23
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,320
I say that it's
time for a change.

24
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,720
We chimpanzees are too few.

25
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,640
How can we take initiative

26
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,560
when they're in control?

27
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,960
Love, yes! War, no!

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,400
No more lies!

29
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,840
No more crying!

30
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,280
No more guns!

31
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,840
No more blood! Stop!

32
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,800
Stop!

33
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,240
Stop the war!

34
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,760
Freedom! Freedom!

35
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,120
Whoa!

36
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,720
Freedom! Peace!

37
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,200
Peace and freedom!

38
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,920
Get off the road, young people.

39
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,320
Freedom! Peace!

40
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,200
Get them out of the way.

41
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,640
Wait.

42
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,840
We don't want martyrs,

43
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,560
do we?

44
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,120
We want peace!

45
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,000
We want freedom!

46
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,000
Major, do it quietly.

47
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,640
We want peace!

48
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,560
We want freedom!

49
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,680
Peace!

50
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,120
Freedom! Peace!

51
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,560
Freedom!

52
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,480
Peace and freedom!

53
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,680
Battalion.

54
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,400
Are you what we were

55
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,840
before we learned to talk

56
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,720
and made a mess of everything?

57
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,720
Did any good ever
come from all that talk

58
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,640
around all those tables?

59
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,400
I wonder where
the hell they are?

60
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,840
I wonder where
the hell we are?

61
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,160
I think we're near
the Forbidden Zone.

62
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,720
That's where the army's headed.

63
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,200
They'll roll right over us.

64
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,120
Why can't we go
back to our outfits?

65
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,040
Because the sarge
says to keep looking

66
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,960
until we find them.

67
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,520
Nova.

68
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,880
Nova, Nova, wake up.

69
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,320
We've got to go. Come on.

70
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,320
That hum...

71
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,680
You hear it, too?

72
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,040
All right, come on,

73
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,440
we're going to follow it.

74
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,840
Well, whoever or whatever...

75
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,200
something's guiding us.

76
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,120
Whatever they are,
they breathe air.

77
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,160
Well, there's an intelligence
working in this place.

78
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,560
That sound, good or bad,
it's either a warning

79
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,480
or a directional device.

80
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,840
It doesn't matter.
They know we're here.

81
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,560
Put my hands...

82
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,720
around her throat.

83
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,400
Off!.

84
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,520
Hold her throat!

85
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,680
She...

86
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,720
dies!

87
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,040
Get out!

88
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,400
Get out of my head!

89
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,320
I reveal my inmost self

90
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,160
unto my God.

91
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,880
What did you say?

92
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,280
What do you mean there's no point?

93
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,640
Will they hurt her?

94
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,000
No, maybe not
physically, but here.

95
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,920
Here, you can hurt here. I know.

96
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,120
Your lips...

97
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,120
don't move.

98
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,040
But I can hear.

99
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,040
No, I mean...

100
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,920
I know what you're thinking.

101
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,240
Nothing. I...

102
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,920
I saw nothing.

103
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,440
Who are you?

104
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,640
It's Brent.

105
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,520
Who are you?

106
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,040
Oh, I see.

107
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,760
The only reality in the universe.

108
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,680
That's nice to know.

109
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:02,880
I got here by accident.
How did you get here?

110
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,280
You got it all wrong.

111
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,000
Why would I want to spy on you?

112
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,160
I'm not even sure you exist.

113
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,000
Ofcourse I know who I am!

114
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,760
I'm an astronaut!

115
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,800
I was sent here
on a rescue mission

116
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,680
to find a fellow
astronaut, Taylor.

117
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,520
We're from this planet,

118
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,560
but from another time,

119
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,560
2,000 years ago.

120
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,400
I know l...

121
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:34,080
I know I sound insane.

122
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,160
And it's my insanity.

123
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:41,760
No, I don't know how to get back.

124
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:46,680
We came through a defect,
a slippage in time.

125
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,640
That's what must have
happened to Taylor.

126
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,520
I'm sure he tried to get back.

127
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,240
Yes, my Skipper is dead.
I'm..I'm alone.

128
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,720
Who?

129
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,680
Nova? What's that?

130
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,400
Some star? A galaxy? What's Nova?

131
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,160
All right, all right, yes!

132
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,000
I know her. I know her.

133
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,760
No, no. She's harmless.

134
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,520
Let her alone.

135
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:43,640
Tell me what you want to know.

136
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,080
Tell me.

137
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,880
She helped me

138
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,720
to break out ofape city.

139
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,480
No! Wait a minute!

140
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,480
Stop it!

141
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,400
I can't understand you.

142
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,760
You're all screaming at me
at the same time.

143
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,480
I can't separate it!

144
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,960
He's right.
He has only limited intelligence.

145
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,440
We should speak aloud,

146
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,960
and one at a time.

147
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,480
You were in the city of the apes?

148
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,480
Yes, two days ago.

149
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,560
What sights did you see?

150
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,160
You're talking.

151
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,080
Certainly we can talk.

152
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,400
We use speech when we must.

153
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,640
When we pray.

154
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,720
When we sing to our God.

155
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:41,800
You mean that..
that thing out there,

156
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,880
an atomic bomb, your god?

157
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,320
You don't understand.

158
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,000
The Bomb is a holy
weapon of peace.

159
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,560
Holy weapon of peace!

160
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,880
Peace.

161
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,200
Mr. Brent, we're a patient people,

162
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:19,040
but we are determined
to know what the apes want..

163
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,960
war or peace.

164
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,880
Try to understand.

165
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:27,720
The only weapons we have
are purely illusion.

166
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,160
You just imagined that he hurt you.

167
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,160
Traumatic hypnosis
is a weapon of peace.

168
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,400
Like the visual deterrent..

169
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,680
or the sonic deterrent..

170
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:53,640
Let me make a last appeal
to your reason

171
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,800
before we inflict more of this on you.

172
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,000
These are weapons of peace, Mr. Brent.

173
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,120
Like all our weapons.

174
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,360
Mere illusions.

175
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,680
Mere illusions? Damn your hypocrisy!

176
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,040
Is that bomb out there,
is that an illusion?

177
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,240
It's operational, isn't it?

178
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,800
The firing mechanism..
it's intact, isn't it?

179
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:24,520
We very much need
your help, Mr. Brent.

180
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,000
Why?

181
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,360
We are the keepers
of the Divine Bomb.

182
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,560
It is our only reason for survival.

183
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,480
And yet, as you see,
we are defenseless,

184
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,160
defenseless against
the slaughtering,

185
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,480
monstrous, materialistic apes.

186
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:41,160
I'll help nobody.

187
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,040
So go ahead. Annihilate each other.

188
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,600
I forgive you your language.

189
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,320
Sometimes your sanity
is about to give way.

190
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,720
I hope that does not happen.

191
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,480
I hope you can tell us..

192
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,640
Exactly what the apes are planning.

193
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,680
We've caught some of their scouts.

194
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,920
They're hideous creatures.

195
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,280
We've had them here,

196
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,360
standing precisely where you are now.

197
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,280
Either their skulls were too thick,

198
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,440
or they really
knew nothing at all.

199
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,800
Neither do l.
Can't you understand that?

200
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,600
I don't know anything!

201
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:17,120
You make us very sad, Mr. Brent.

202
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,920
She can't help you.

203
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,840
She can't even talk.

204
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,280
Don't harm her.

205
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,000
We never harm anyone, Mr. Brent.

206
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,400
You're going to harm her.

207
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,760
The apes sent me out to you.

208
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,240
You're lying.

209
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,720
How do you know?

210
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,840
How do you always know?

211
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,440
Nova.

212
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,960
Now..

213
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,400
Tell us of the apes.

214
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:49,640
The apes...

215
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,360
are marching on your city.

216
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,120
Bugler,

217
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,040
sound the advance.

218
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,400
Ursus!

219
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,120
Ursus, I warned you.

220
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,400
Look what we're faced with!

221
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,320
I told you you should wait!

222
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,640
Brutal butchery!

223
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,040
I swear, those responsible

224
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,600
shall pay with
torture and with death.

225
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,200
If you have any pity,

226
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,400
give orders to shoot
our poor people.

227
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,440
I can't order them to do
what the Lawgiver has forbidden.

228
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,400
Ape shall not kill ape.

229
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,320
Hold your positions!

230
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,840
He bleeds.

231
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,000
The Lawgiver bleeds!

232
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,480
The spirit of the Lawgiver lives!

233
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:09,360
We are still God's chosen!

234
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,240
This is a vision!

235
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,400
And it is a lie!

236
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,120
The vision was false!

237
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,280
Bugler,

238
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,800
sound the advance.

239
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,600
Advance!

240
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,480
Stupid animals.

241
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:25,800
They don't have the brain
to hold our illusions.

242
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,720
We have no defense.

243
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,160
Except our Bomb.

244
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,720
Call our people to the high sanctuary.

245
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,680
Do you know the range

246
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,720
of their city?

247
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,440
Yes.

248
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,240
Set in the mechanism and wait for me.

249
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,800
I want a public thought projection

250
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,200
at adult and infant level.

251
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:43,360
Adults to the cathedral,
infants indoors.

252
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,280
Is nowandevershallbe

253
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,000
World without end

254
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,680
Amen

255
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:34,200
Amen

256
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:37,960
Amen

257
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,520
Amen

258
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,120
The heavens declare
the glory of the Bomb,

259
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,880
and the firmament
showeth His handiwork.

260
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,000
His sun has gone out
unto all the land.

261
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:57,440
And gives light
unto the end of the world.

262
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,840
He descendeth from the
outermost part of heaven,

263
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,080
and there is nothing
hid from the heat thereof.

264
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,960
There is neither
speech nor language,

265
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,920
yet His voice is heard among them.

266
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,000
Praise Him.

267
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,400
Praise Him.

268
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,000
My strength and my redeemer.

269
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,920
Glory be to the Bomb

270
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,240
and to the holy fallout

271
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,440
as it was in
the beginning, is now,

272
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,080
and ever shall be,
world without end.

273
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,640
Amen.

274
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,320
Amen

275
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,600
Amen

276
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:50,640
Amen

277
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,720
Amen

278
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,600
Almighty and everlasting Bomb,

279
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,840
who came down among us

280
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,760
to make heaven under Earth,

281
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,160
Iighten our darkness.

282
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,200
I nstrument ofGod,
grant us Thy peace.

283
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,920
AlmightyBomb

284
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,320

Andcreatedangels

286

BeholdHis glory

287
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,240
Behold the truth that abides in us.

288
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,280
Reveal that truth unto that Maker.

289
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:33,000
I reveal my inmost self unto my God.

290
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,640
Unto my God.

291
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:44,920
Unto my God

292
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:10,040
All things brightandbeautiful

293
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:16,120
All creatures greatandsmall

294
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:20,760
All things wise and wonderful

295
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:26,880
The good Bomb made us all

296
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:31,840
He gave us eyes to see with

297
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:37,400
And lips that we might tell

298
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:43,440
How great the Bomb Almighty

299
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:51,480
Who made all things well

300
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,840
Let everyone go
to his private shelter.

301
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,400
Empty the streets.

302
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,960
They're to find
the city of the dead.

303
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,960
May the blessing
of the Bomb Almighty

304
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,880
and the fellowship
of the Holy Fallout

305
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:09,600
descend on us this day
and forevermore.

306
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:24,840
Amen

307
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,640
I trust this simple ceremony

308
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,840
convinced you of
our peaceable intentions,

309
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,840
and I'd like to thankyou
foryour cooperation.

310
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,720
When may we hope
to be set free?

311
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:38,080
You may hope whenever
you please, Mr. Brent.

312
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,480
How could we
hope to let you go

313
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,400
on the eve ofwar, Mr. Brent?

314
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,680
You know too many ofour secrets,

315
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,240
Iike your friend.

316
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,120
Taylor!

317
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,320
You're Brent.

318
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,400
My God, Taylor!

319
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,800
Brent! How in the hell
did you get here?

320
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,720
Spaceship, ape city, subway..

321
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,080
Byyourself?

322
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,520
No, Nova found me.

323
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,440
Nova? ls she with you? Where?

324
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,960
I don't know. They separated us.

325
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,960
They tried to make me kill her.

326
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,560
Mr. Taylor, Mr. Brent,
we're peaceful people.

327
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,960
We don't kill our enemies.

328
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:48,960
We get our enemies
to kill each other.

329
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,360
I'm fighting it.

330
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,600
I'm fighting it off.

331
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,560
Taylor.

332
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,840
Taylor.

333
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,520
Taylor!

334
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,440
Unto God...

335
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:13,160
I reveal my inmost self.

336
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,320
This isn't exactly sterile.

337
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:46,680
We'll do the best we can.

338
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,600
Taylor.

339
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:51,080
Taylor, they've got a bomb..

340
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,240
Atomic bomb.

341
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,160
It's operational.

342
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:58,520
They intend to use it.

343
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,960
What type is it?

344
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,400
I don't know.
I don't know what type.

345
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,800
I've never seen it before.

346
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,240
Didn't you see a series number?

347
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:10,640
No numbers, just some
letters on one of the fins,

348
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,120
Greek letters.

349
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,320
Alpha...

350
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,960
And omega.

351
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,120
What?

352
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,480
The doomsday bomb.

353
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,880
My God.

354
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:36,720
Another lovely souvenir
from the 20th Century.

355
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,640
They weren't satisfied with a bomb

356
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,040
that could knock out a city.

357
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:45,360
They finally built one
with a cobalt casing,

358
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,720
all in the sweet name of peace.

359
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,120
Those bloody fools.

360
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,360
They don't know what they've got.

361
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,880
They pray to the damn thing.

362
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,280
If they shoot it off,

363
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:02,160
it could set off a chain reaction

364
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,600
in the whole atmosphere.

365
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,840
Burn the planet to a cinder.

366
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,440
How's that for
your ultimate weapon?

367
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:25,200
This must be what
your scout reported,

368
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,280
a subterranean passage.

369
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,640
I think it's worth exploring.

370
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,880
What will you do, Holiness?

371
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,600
Everything necessary.

372
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:22,800
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

373
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,720
I'm thinking just that.

374
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,720
Nova.

375
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:54,840
Nova.

376
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,480
Ah, God!

377
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,440
Should let them all die..

378
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,360
the gorillas, every damn...

379
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,120
When it comes time.

380
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,800
It's time it was finished.

381
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,520
Finished.

382
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,560
Taylor.

383
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,560
Come on, come on.

384
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,400
The bomb.

385
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,800
Yeah.

386
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,520
Why not?

387
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,640
They're obscene!

388
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:26,360
Follow me!

389
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,560
Sergeant!

390
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,800
Arrest that creature.

391
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:18,520
This is the instrument of my God.

392
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,920
He can speak.

393
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:39,000
Your God, eh?

394
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:41,960
Sergeant.

395
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:56,760
Your God didn't
save you, did he, huh?

396
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:58,320
Ursus!

397
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:01,200
That weapon is built by man.

398
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:05,120
You can't shoot it
down with bullets.

399
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:08,840
If we can't shoot it down,
we'll pull it down.

400
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:11,080
Rope! Block and tackle!

401
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:14,280
You don't know what you're doing.

402
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,400
It will kill us all!

403
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,440
I'll find a way to stop it.

404
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,360
Men, over there!

405
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,840
Ursus, someone at the pillar!

406
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:47,000
Zaius.

407
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:49,720
Taylor!

408
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,640
It's dooms day.

409
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:55,920
The end of the world.

410
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,320
Help me.

411
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:00,240
You ask me to help you!

412
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:01,360
Man is evil,

413
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,920
capable of nothing
but destruction!

414
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:15,600
You...

415
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:18,480
bloody bastard.

416
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:40,040
In one of the countless billions
of galaxies in the universe

417
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:42,000
Iies a medium-sized star.

418
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:44,400
And one of its satellites,

419
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:47,600
a green
and insignificant planet,
now is dead.
