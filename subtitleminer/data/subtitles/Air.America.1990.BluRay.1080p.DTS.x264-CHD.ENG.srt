1
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:17,187
There are no American
combat forces in Laos.

2
00:02:41,253 --> 00:02:46,258
We are concerned by the
North Vietnamese move into Laos.

3
00:03:04,193 --> 00:03:07,279
50000 North Vietnamese
are there at the present time.

4
00:04:17,016 --> 00:04:20,227
American participation in Laos is at

5
00:04:20,811 --> 00:04:23,397
the request
of the neutralist government

6
00:04:23,981 --> 00:04:28,986
which was set up in accordance
with the 1962 accords, agreed to

7
00:04:29,945 --> 00:04:31,864
by Hanoi, Peking, and the USSR.

8
00:04:32,448 --> 00:04:36,035
We have been providing
logistical support

9
00:04:36,618 --> 00:04:42,332
and some training
to avoid Laos falling

10
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:45,586
under Communist domination.

11
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:48,672
No American manpower in Laos

12
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:52,676
is there on a combat basis.

13
00:05:10,569 --> 00:05:11,528
Come on!

14
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:47,606
Gene, no!

15
00:05:48,315 --> 00:05:49,274
No chance.

16
00:05:49,858 --> 00:05:51,402
Get back! Stay back!

17
00:05:55,614 --> 00:05:56,740
Son of a bitch.

18
00:05:58,409 --> 00:05:59,243
Gene...

19
00:05:59,827 --> 00:06:02,663
To hell with the cargo!
Is he dead?

20
00:06:04,373 --> 00:06:07,835
Well, Rob, if he's not
he's very, very calm.

21
00:06:08,877 --> 00:06:10,546
Jesus, I'm sorry.

22
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:12,297
Hey, Gene

23
00:06:15,259 --> 00:06:17,428
We're not here right now.

24
00:06:19,263 --> 00:06:21,223
I saw Nixon on TV.

25
00:06:21,807 --> 00:06:25,602
So we're not actually here

26
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:27,688
and this didn't happen.

27
00:06:28,272 --> 00:06:31,608
Maybe not for you
and not for Nixon

28
00:06:33,402 --> 00:06:37,156
but it happened for Doug.
We sure go through pilots.

29
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,617
Gene! Remember!

30
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:42,661
Shhh!

31
00:06:43,245 --> 00:06:48,417
Since we're not here, I don't remember
what the fuck you didn't say.

32
00:06:49,001 --> 00:06:52,588
These pilots are head cases!
Yeah.

33
00:06:53,172 --> 00:06:56,216
And the worst part is
we need more of 'em.

34
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:45,891
Now to our "eye in the sky"
pilot Billy Covington.

35
00:07:46,475 --> 00:07:47,893
How ya doing up there?

36
00:07:48,477 --> 00:07:51,730
I think the music speaks for me:

37
00:07:52,314 --> 00:07:54,274
"All I want is to be 'a free

38
00:07:54,858 --> 00:07:58,028
live my life the way I want 'a be."

39
00:07:58,612 --> 00:08:00,489
How's the traffic, Billy?

40
00:08:01,073 --> 00:08:03,784
Traffic's kinda depressing. Sad.

41
00:08:04,368 --> 00:08:07,079
Real congested.
Kinda bumsy looking

42
00:08:07,663 --> 00:08:11,250
to tell you.
We've heard there's

43
00:08:11,834 --> 00:08:13,502
a whale of a jam on the 103.

44
00:08:14,086 --> 00:08:17,506
Yeah. You know why?
That's why we

45
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:21,051
go to you, Bill.
I'll tell you.

46
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:25,055
'Cause most drivers turn into
pagan rubbernecks, hoping

47
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:28,392
to see a fatality. Makes a
gawker's block

48
00:08:28,976 --> 00:08:31,437
for a coupla miles back.

49
00:08:32,021 --> 00:08:33,605
Not unlike this moron

50
00:08:34,189 --> 00:08:38,527
in the brown 18 wheeler from
Rubio moving and hauling.

51
00:08:39,486 --> 00:08:41,363
'Scuse me a sec, Stevie.

52
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:44,700
Move your truck!
An ambulance is coming!

53
00:08:45,284 --> 00:08:47,578
Fuck you, "eye in the sky!"

54
00:08:48,162 --> 00:08:49,913
Fuck me?
Yeah! Fuck you!

55
00:08:50,497 --> 00:08:52,875
What'd you say?
I said fuck you!

56
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:55,544
You want a convertible?
Get down here

57
00:08:56,128 --> 00:08:58,797
fucking punk. I'll kick your ass!

58
00:08:59,381 --> 00:09:00,507
You airborne piece of shit!

59
00:09:01,091 --> 00:09:07,139
This is Rock 1080, where else can you
get such in depth traffic reporting?

60
00:09:07,723 --> 00:09:10,476
You should be arrested!
This is very dangerous!

61
00:09:14,646 --> 00:09:18,233
I'll bust that whirlybird
to hell and back!

62
00:09:48,138 --> 00:09:49,682
License SUSPEN DED

63
00:09:58,357 --> 00:09:59,441
Hey, Billy.

64
00:10:00,025 --> 00:10:02,945
Who are you?
Heard about your fall from grace.

65
00:10:03,529 --> 00:10:06,490
An adventurer without an adventure.
Wrong.

66
00:10:07,074 --> 00:10:09,660
Nothing lower than a grounded pilot.
Who are you?

67
00:10:10,202 --> 00:10:14,748
I want to ask you why you flew
so low over that accident?

68
00:10:15,332 --> 00:10:17,418
The ambulance couldn't get through.

69
00:10:19,878 --> 00:10:23,757
I want to be down in the action.
Thought so.

70
00:10:24,341 --> 00:10:29,263
The thing that got you fired here
can get you hired in Laos.

71
00:10:29,847 --> 00:10:30,806
There's a war there!

72
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:34,476
In Vietnam, not Laos.
You saw the President on TV?

73
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:37,438
Heckle and Jeckle talk on TV
doesn't mean

74
00:10:38,022 --> 00:10:40,941
I believe birds can really talk.
Point taken.

75
00:10:41,525 --> 00:10:43,402
But there's no war in Laos.

76
00:10:43,986 --> 00:10:47,239
You can take that to the bank.
Who'll be signing my checks?

77
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:51,535
Our outfit's called Air America.
Strictly civilian.

78
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:54,288
American Pilots. Men like you.

79
00:10:54,872 --> 00:11:00,419
Wild men flying cargo and
refugees in the wild East.

80
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:03,047
FAA took my ticket, man.

81
00:11:03,922 --> 00:11:05,924
Get you a new one in Taiwan.
No sweat.

82
00:11:07,593 --> 00:11:08,969
Who are you?

83
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:12,431
Your biggest fan.

84
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:14,868
What's it supposed to be?
Sound of the torment of war.

85
00:12:15,452 --> 00:12:18,372
When the enemy hears this
coming from your planes

86
00:12:18,956 --> 00:12:21,875
they'll flip. The North Vietnamese

87
00:12:22,459 --> 00:12:27,256
are pouring into Laos heading to
Saigon along the Ho Chi Minh trail

88
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,967
hooking up with their Commie buddies.

89
00:12:30,551 --> 00:12:34,555
We blast 'em with this stuff
they panic, they scatter. I admit

90
00:12:35,139 --> 00:12:38,684
it's a dangerous mission.
Worse than dangerous.

91
00:12:39,268 --> 00:12:41,854
This is embarrassing, man!

92
00:12:42,438 --> 00:12:44,440
They'll point and laugh!

93
00:12:45,024 --> 00:12:46,692
This tape

94
00:12:47,276 --> 00:12:50,863
was made by experts for maximum
psychological effect.

95
00:12:51,613 --> 00:12:53,907
You've got no idea
who you're fighting here.

96
00:12:54,491 --> 00:12:57,703
You know more about it
than American Intelligence.

97
00:12:58,287 --> 00:13:04,376
Don't use the word "intelligence"
to describe your job.

98
00:13:07,546 --> 00:13:09,298
Rob Diehl? Hi.

99
00:13:09,882 --> 00:13:11,300
I'm Billy Covington.

100
00:13:11,884 --> 00:13:14,470
Welcome.
Thanks.

101
00:13:15,012 --> 00:13:18,891
You have some paperwork?
Nice bat.

102
00:13:19,475 --> 00:13:21,393
Billy is one of you guys.

103
00:13:23,354 --> 00:13:25,314
Thanks. So talk to 'em.

104
00:13:26,815 --> 00:13:29,777
Hi, guys.
What brings you here, Covington?

105
00:13:31,153 --> 00:13:33,238
I hear there's some good flying.

106
00:13:33,822 --> 00:13:34,740
Good flying?

107
00:13:35,991 --> 00:13:36,742
Yeah?

108
00:13:37,326 --> 00:13:39,203
Depends where you're coming from.

109
00:13:39,787 --> 00:13:41,830
Where are you coming from?

110
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:47,127
From L.A. The west coast of the US.
Where are you coming from?

111
00:13:47,795 --> 00:13:49,963
From the dark side of the moon.

112
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:54,051
And I'm going back there soon.

113
00:13:56,303 --> 00:13:58,514
The golden BB is coming.
My bat.

114
00:13:59,098 --> 00:14:00,891
Nomenclature: BB, gold.

115
00:14:01,475 --> 00:14:03,519
Ordinance: Personnel, Neely.

116
00:14:05,562 --> 00:14:07,356
And the four rounds you can't...

117
00:14:08,357 --> 00:14:10,651
Pilot hi jinks.
It's their way of coping.

118
00:14:11,235 --> 00:14:14,363
Pilot hi jinks?
This is psychotic behavior.

119
00:14:14,947 --> 00:14:19,535
Psychotic behavior is company policy
at Air America. I'm Gene Ryack.

120
00:14:20,369 --> 00:14:25,124
Take Billy on his orientation flight.
OK with me. Is it OK with you?

121
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:29,044
Let's get in the wind.
Give him the bat.

122
00:14:30,045 --> 00:14:33,090
This is Long Tieng, right?
Right.

123
00:14:33,674 --> 00:14:37,094
There's nothing here on the map.

124
00:14:37,678 --> 00:14:41,557
Well I guess it's like Rob says.
We're not here.

125
00:14:42,141 --> 00:14:45,602
Which means you're not seeing
the second biggest city in Laos

126
00:14:46,186 --> 00:14:48,981
built from scratch
by the U. S. Government.

127
00:14:49,565 --> 00:14:53,402
And we really don't run 400 flights
or ship 100 tons of cargo

128
00:14:53,986 --> 00:14:57,281
medicine, weapons
or local troops, like those.

129
00:14:57,865 --> 00:15:01,910
"Anywhere, anything, any time."
That's our motto.

130
00:15:02,494 --> 00:15:06,957
We fly C 123, Helio Couriers
fairly normal machines.

131
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:10,461
But the real fun is playing
with these freaky planes.

132
00:15:11,045 --> 00:15:14,882
These aren't legal in the US.
This ain't the States.

133
00:15:15,466 --> 00:15:16,508
Damn right.

134
00:15:18,969 --> 00:15:22,306
Watcha got today?
Peanut butter and mayo. What you got?

135
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,933
Flight schedule.
About time

136
00:15:48,374 --> 00:15:50,292
You seem to be doing OK.

137
00:15:51,669 --> 00:15:55,005
I do all right in the air
I tend to fuck up on the ground.

138
00:15:55,589 --> 00:15:58,842
Mind if I look in your logbook?

139
00:16:01,261 --> 00:16:03,305
14 months of bush flying in Canada.

140
00:16:03,889 --> 00:16:06,350
Bush flying?
Yeah, bush flying.

141
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:09,937
2 months crop dusting
outside of Fresno.

142
00:16:10,521 --> 00:16:12,690
Fresno. You’re a real fucking hero.

143
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:20,447
You flew "eye in the sky"?
Excuse me, is that an Uzi?

144
00:16:21,031 --> 00:16:23,450
That'd make a great ad:

145
00:16:24,118 --> 00:16:26,328
"Excuse me, is that an Uzi?"
"Why yes

146
00:16:26,912 --> 00:16:31,583
self defense is no joke.
That's why I pack an Uzi.

147
00:16:32,167 --> 00:16:33,377
Accept no substitutes."

148
00:16:33,961 --> 00:16:35,629
Show him your amulet, Gene!

149
00:16:37,464 --> 00:16:38,298
What's in there?

150
00:16:38,882 --> 00:16:42,886
The ashes of my big toe. Shot off
through the floor of the cockpit.

151
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:44,596
Not far from here.

152
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,808
You get shot here?
It was ugly.

153
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:50,310
He had it cremated.

154
00:16:50,894 --> 00:16:52,980
Always has it with him.
Wait a sec.

155
00:16:53,564 --> 00:16:57,693
No one told me about losing toes.
He never mentioned toe loss.

156
00:16:58,485 --> 00:17:00,112
Who
The recruiter.

157
00:17:00,988 --> 00:17:03,574
Why didn't you get it
sewn back on?

158
00:17:04,116 --> 00:17:07,870
When a piece of me gets shot off
I don't want it back.

159
00:17:08,454 --> 00:17:10,289
It's still with us in spirit.

160
00:17:10,873 --> 00:17:12,041
You understand?

161
00:17:12,624 --> 00:17:15,252
In spirit, toe ism.

162
00:17:29,725 --> 00:17:34,980
Royal Asian Airlines Flight No. 744.
Arriving at gate 12.

163
00:17:36,523 --> 00:17:38,442
Glad you could make it, sir.

164
00:17:41,653 --> 00:17:47,868
A US senator? In my back yard?
On a fact finding mission?

165
00:17:48,702 --> 00:17:51,914
He's not gonna find any facts.
I promise.

166
00:17:52,498 --> 00:17:57,044
Certainly not about our little deal.
Besides, he's a dimwit.

167
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,881
He had a tractor dealership
before he got elected.

168
00:18:02,383 --> 00:18:07,513
Harry Truman sold cheap suits
he wound up dropping an atomic bomb.

169
00:18:27,074 --> 00:18:30,285
Welcome to Vientiane, sir.
Thank you, Ambassador Marloff.

170
00:18:30,869 --> 00:18:34,790
Senator, this is major Lemond.
I'm sure you've heard of him.

171
00:18:35,374 --> 00:18:39,128
Of course. Where's the uniform, Major?
Too hot for all those ribbons?

172
00:18:39,712 --> 00:18:43,966
You going civvie on us?
I'm a civilian now.

173
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:46,677
With the Air Force at heart.

174
00:18:49,638 --> 00:18:52,808
Thank you. Put bag in big car.
Senator...

175
00:18:53,392 --> 00:18:54,435
I know.

176
00:18:55,019 --> 00:18:57,604
Sorry
have no local dinero.

177
00:18:58,188 --> 00:18:59,982
Give tip later OK?
Senator!

178
00:19:00,566 --> 00:19:04,611
This is General Lu Soong
Supreme Commander of the Allies.

179
00:19:08,615 --> 00:19:09,908
Hello?

180
00:19:10,534 --> 00:19:11,577
Anybody home?

181
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:14,496
Get a load of Senator Tact here.

182
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:19,001
When you go to France, you have
General DeGaulle carry luggage?

183
00:19:19,793 --> 00:19:20,919
Rob, the bag.

184
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,967
I'll take that, sir. Your jacket?
Thank you.

185
00:19:34,767 --> 00:19:37,728
Lighten up on the stick.
We're gonna land.

186
00:19:38,604 --> 00:19:39,855
Land? Where?

187
00:19:40,439 --> 00:19:43,442
I'll show you.
Oh, come on.

188
00:19:45,652 --> 00:19:48,947
That's not a strip, it's a mountain.
Full flap, 3 cranks.

189
00:19:57,748 --> 00:19:58,957
Please don't do this.

190
00:20:10,386 --> 00:20:12,638
That was great. How was it for you?

191
00:20:37,121 --> 00:20:39,331
There're people in the jungle!

192
00:20:40,499 --> 00:20:42,001
Don't, I know them.

193
00:20:42,584 --> 00:20:43,627
Who are they?

194
00:20:44,211 --> 00:20:47,673
Friends of my wife.
Little one's my brother in law

195
00:20:48,257 --> 00:20:50,843
with a business proposition.
Don't do that.

196
00:21:12,614 --> 00:21:16,618
Six crates of weapons.
I'll make you a good offer.

197
00:21:19,496 --> 00:21:22,291
The Russians air dropped them
for the Pathet Lao.

198
00:21:24,126 --> 00:21:26,003
We stole 'em. Brand new.

199
00:21:31,842 --> 00:21:33,719
I'll give you 400 kips.

200
00:21:34,845 --> 00:21:39,099
400? You want a slingshot?
800 kips!

201
00:21:43,645 --> 00:21:45,647
600, and it's a deal.

202
00:21:51,028 --> 00:21:53,197
Brother in laws are the same all over.

203
00:21:53,781 --> 00:21:55,240
He's ripping me off...

204
00:21:55,824 --> 00:21:56,825
Deal!

205
00:22:13,467 --> 00:22:17,554
You use my orientation flight
for some private scam?

206
00:22:18,305 --> 00:22:19,848
Welcome to the orient.

207
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:23,227
This is my retirement plan!

208
00:22:23,977 --> 00:22:29,233
I've been flying fifteen years and
want my chunk of the American dream.

209
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,361
Running guns?

210
00:22:40,744 --> 00:22:42,705
OK, this is the hard part.

211
00:22:43,455 --> 00:22:45,582
I noticed, no radar.

212
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:49,044
Right, just dead reckoning.

213
00:22:50,129 --> 00:22:51,755
I can handle it.

214
00:22:52,756 --> 00:22:53,632
Good.

215
00:23:06,437 --> 00:23:09,023
Gene, sit down. Check this out!

216
00:23:12,026 --> 00:23:13,235
Pretty good, huh?

217
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:41,430
OK, we almost hit that at 3700
feet. Any higher peaks than that?

218
00:23:42,306 --> 00:23:46,769
At 3700 feet! Any higher
peaks around here?

219
00:23:47,353 --> 00:23:48,312
Yeah.

220
00:23:48,896 --> 00:23:51,023
I need green.
Don't use mine.

221
00:23:51,607 --> 00:23:54,443
We gotta get on a new
safety height, OK?

222
00:23:55,027 --> 00:23:58,113
Hey, I was going for that one!
You did that on purpose.

223
00:23:58,697 --> 00:24:02,743
Last time you colored the sky pink.
Are we south or east of

224
00:24:03,327 --> 00:24:04,495
the Atlantic here?

225
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:06,580
South or east?

226
00:24:08,582 --> 00:24:12,378
South or east?
East! Don't bother me!

227
00:24:12,961 --> 00:24:14,963
Stay on your side!
It's my coloring book.

228
00:24:15,547 --> 00:24:18,926
If you want to color
you have to be nice to me.

229
00:24:35,818 --> 00:24:39,154
Hey, Senator
let us show you the real Laos!

230
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:43,659
Sir, he's getting out.

231
00:24:44,243 --> 00:24:45,828
Senator, wait!

232
00:24:47,496 --> 00:24:50,332
Those pilots are drunk.
Not just drunk

233
00:24:50,916 --> 00:24:53,544
they're drunk Americans.
Hey, fellas!

234
00:24:55,045 --> 00:24:57,297
Pitchin' a little woo, are ya?

235
00:24:59,383 --> 00:25:03,220
Don't be embarrassed.
I may look like an old fart

236
00:25:03,804 --> 00:25:07,725
but before I found the lord, I partook
of wine, women, and song, too.

237
00:25:10,894 --> 00:25:16,066
But seriously, even though you won't
get any medals, or be in history books

238
00:25:17,109 --> 00:25:19,028
some of us in Washington know exactly

239
00:25:19,611 --> 00:25:21,488
what you're doing for the war effort.

240
00:25:22,406 --> 00:25:24,783
Could you explain it to us?

241
00:25:45,554 --> 00:25:47,931
It's just as heavy as Vietnam.
No!

242
00:25:48,515 --> 00:25:50,976
Never compare the two.

243
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:55,439
Vietnam is for niggers and no necks.

244
00:25:56,023 --> 00:25:58,233
Sorry
it's the Mai Tai talking.

245
00:26:00,194 --> 00:26:04,198
This is a gentleman's war
a thinking man's war.

246
00:26:04,907 --> 00:26:05,908
Hello.

247
00:26:07,785 --> 00:26:10,412
Corinne Landreaux
this is Billy Covington.

248
00:26:10,996 --> 00:26:14,541
She helps our Asian brothers
in the hills. Thanks.

249
00:26:15,125 --> 00:26:17,044
Hey, I kid, because I care.

250
00:26:18,629 --> 00:26:21,715
You know what the whole problem
with the Vietnam war is?

251
00:26:24,426 --> 00:26:28,347
It's too public.
A secret war is the way to go.

252
00:26:28,931 --> 00:26:32,393
No reporters, no TV
You blackout the war

253
00:26:32,976 --> 00:26:36,772
like a football game.
And y'know what?

254
00:26:39,316 --> 00:26:40,776
We can't lose.

255
00:26:42,236 --> 00:26:44,071
Can I ask you one thing?

256
00:26:45,155 --> 00:26:49,159
Is it a kinky turn on for you
to bring her to a whorehouse with you?

257
00:26:50,661 --> 00:26:55,958
This is not just a whorehouse.
Men talk business here.

258
00:26:56,542 --> 00:26:58,836
I was just getting used to
this being a war.

259
00:27:00,671 --> 00:27:03,173
Who told you
they were two different things?

260
00:27:03,757 --> 00:27:05,467
Rob, I need you outside.

261
00:27:06,051 --> 00:27:08,137
And clear headed!

262
00:27:21,525 --> 00:27:22,693
Worried, Rob?

263
00:27:23,277 --> 00:27:27,781
I wonder what the Pepsi people
would think if they knew.

264
00:27:28,991 --> 00:27:31,702
Don't you ever wonder?
No.

265
00:27:32,286 --> 00:27:35,581
I wonder how many pilots
already know about his place.

266
00:27:40,836 --> 00:27:44,840
Heroin good, very good.
You want to try?

267
00:27:45,883 --> 00:27:49,303
With all due respect
I'm not here for a taste test.

268
00:27:49,887 --> 00:27:53,474
I'm here to ask you again

269
00:27:54,058 --> 00:27:57,353
to shut this lab down
just while the Senator is here.

270
00:27:57,936 --> 00:28:03,192
Why you not tell baggage man
Senator to go home? Kick out!

271
00:28:03,984 --> 00:28:06,570
I wish it were that simple.

272
00:28:07,112 --> 00:28:10,991
In a civilized country like yours
it would be.

273
00:28:11,575 --> 00:28:16,914
But in this case, it's easier
to shut down this lab.

274
00:28:17,498 --> 00:28:19,875
Then you and me be poor
and cannot pay for war.

275
00:28:20,459 --> 00:28:24,088
If we don't sell heroin
no money to feed my soldiers.

276
00:28:24,672 --> 00:28:27,925
No, Major.
Better we stay good friends.

277
00:28:29,301 --> 00:28:32,680
You take care of silly
suitcase man OK?

278
00:28:34,973 --> 00:28:36,600
Of course, General.

279
00:28:37,184 --> 00:28:41,397
As always, you are right.

280
00:29:00,708 --> 00:29:02,668
Something wrong?

281
00:29:03,585 --> 00:29:08,215
I was always the weirdest guy in the
room. Here I'm not in the running.

282
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:11,427
You can be as weird as anyone here.

283
00:29:12,011 --> 00:29:14,430
It just takes a little time.

284
00:29:15,639 --> 00:29:18,142
I feel like I'm on
a roller coaster of bar girls

285
00:29:18,726 --> 00:29:21,437
strange squiggly signs
weird vehicles and

286
00:29:22,021 --> 00:29:23,522
more bar girls, and Mai Tais and

287
00:29:24,106 --> 00:29:28,610
what am I doing here?
I ask myself that all the time.

288
00:29:29,153 --> 00:29:33,073
Why am I here?
Why am I here?

289
00:29:35,701 --> 00:29:37,578
A taste of the States, feel better?

290
00:29:38,495 --> 00:29:41,290
Yeah, everything's back to normal now.
Good.

291
00:29:56,972 --> 00:29:58,223
Nice silencer.

292
00:29:58,807 --> 00:30:01,435
I am a very considerate person.

293
00:30:02,186 --> 00:30:06,565
If I want to shoot lizards at night
on my miniature golf course

294
00:30:07,232 --> 00:30:10,194
no reason to keep the neighbors awake.

295
00:30:10,778 --> 00:30:14,281
You follow me?
Yeah, at a distance.

296
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:21,872
You're all right... fuckin' punk.

297
00:30:22,456 --> 00:30:27,461
Jack's the only man you ever met
with his own miniature golf course.

298
00:30:28,045 --> 00:30:32,508
Why don't you open this place up
and charge admission?

299
00:30:33,092 --> 00:30:34,968
You guys can do that when I'm gone.

300
00:30:35,594 --> 00:30:38,180
You guys get it in my will.
Oh, shit. Please!

301
00:30:39,014 --> 00:30:41,225
Jack's got a point:

302
00:30:41,809 --> 00:30:43,769
The old timers don't get a pension.

303
00:30:44,353 --> 00:30:47,648
Each pilot has to work out
his own retirement scam.

304
00:30:49,233 --> 00:30:52,945
Gino, how's your guns and ammo shop?
Building up inventory?

305
00:30:53,529 --> 00:30:57,950
You ever gonna sell?
Never make a move too soon.

306
00:30:58,534 --> 00:31:01,996
I got a foolproof plan.
I'll take my money...

307
00:31:02,579 --> 00:31:05,416
...and fly a Coppertone banner
over Coney Island

308
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,045
and tell war stories in bars.

309
00:31:15,217 --> 00:31:20,180
"The golden BB's coming up
to Neely now..."

310
00:31:28,147 --> 00:31:29,606
Why you do that?

311
00:31:30,774 --> 00:31:32,026
Why the fuck?

312
00:31:41,285 --> 00:31:43,454
Hey, professionalism.

313
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:47,249
How often do you guys
go on a bender like this?

314
00:31:47,833 --> 00:31:50,085
Bender?
This is just nighttime.

315
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:20,574
O.V.!

316
00:32:21,158 --> 00:32:24,244
Wake Billy!
I gotta bring him to work.

317
00:32:29,708 --> 00:32:32,378
Wake up, junior! Wake up!

318
00:32:45,808 --> 00:32:49,144
It's OK. He likes to fly.

319
00:33:41,655 --> 00:33:42,823
Good morning!

320
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,923
Crazy Americans!

321
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:08,325
Gene.
Morning, Rob. Morning.

322
00:35:08,909 --> 00:35:12,955
Pick up Senator Davenport
at the Vientiane airport

323
00:35:13,539 --> 00:35:15,624
and take him up to the
refugee camp at Bien Luc.

324
00:35:16,208 --> 00:35:19,128
Lips zipped about this airbase.

325
00:35:19,712 --> 00:35:23,716
If he's dying for local action
just dazzle him with bullshit.

326
00:35:24,299 --> 00:35:27,720
We got nothing else
to dazzle him with.

327
00:35:28,303 --> 00:35:29,680
See ya!

328
00:35:32,641 --> 00:35:35,352
Gene!
Don't fuck around with the Senator.

329
00:35:35,936 --> 00:35:39,148
What do you mean?
He's on a need to know basis.

330
00:35:39,732 --> 00:35:43,777
The mushroom treatment: Keep him
in the dark and feed him on shit.

331
00:35:51,493 --> 00:35:53,620
What's he doing to your plane?

332
00:35:54,204 --> 00:35:56,623
He's purifying it.
It's a Buddhist ritual.

333
00:36:17,561 --> 00:36:20,564
Gene, is there
a secret air base around here?

334
00:36:21,148 --> 00:36:23,108
Which air base, sir?

335
00:36:26,195 --> 00:36:28,447
I feel I'm being
kept out of the loop.

336
00:36:29,031 --> 00:36:32,493
What do I know.
I'm just a luggage boy.

337
00:36:33,077 --> 00:36:36,288
General, stop pouting.
I apologized.

338
00:36:36,872 --> 00:36:39,041
I should be carrying your luggage.

339
00:36:39,625 --> 00:36:42,795
That's how much the US government
values your support.

340
00:36:45,464 --> 00:36:49,259
I hear that the USA finish war
and leave Southeast Asia.

341
00:36:49,843 --> 00:36:52,930
Without suitcase.
General

342
00:36:54,181 --> 00:36:57,810
if things get too hairy for us
politically, we have to bug out

343
00:36:58,394 --> 00:36:59,645
and bring you with us.

344
00:37:00,229 --> 00:37:03,148
We take care of our buddies.
You take care of shit!

345
00:37:03,732 --> 00:37:08,028
We've made general Ky in Vietnam
a very generous offer.

346
00:37:08,612 --> 00:37:12,074
I know Marshal Ky.
He's small time.

347
00:37:12,658 --> 00:37:15,494
After war he want to be in America
liquor store owner.

348
00:37:16,078 --> 00:37:19,915
I not going from being warlord
to liquor store owner!

349
00:37:22,793 --> 00:37:27,047
Tell the Senator
what you really want, General.

350
00:37:27,631 --> 00:37:29,717
Come on, don't be shy.

351
00:37:31,176 --> 00:37:33,804
Holiday Inn. Southern California.

352
00:37:34,388 --> 00:37:36,140
Owner and operator.

353
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:40,853
That could be difficult.

354
00:37:42,187 --> 00:37:43,689
You find all this funny?

355
00:37:44,273 --> 00:37:47,026
Very. But, hell, Senator

356
00:37:47,609 --> 00:37:50,738
If you can't laugh at war
what's the use of fighting?

357
00:37:54,033 --> 00:37:56,452
You've got a good point!

358
00:38:25,314 --> 00:38:28,067
What's that tin horn general
doing in my camp?

359
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:32,529
Corinne, this is Senator Davenport.
Welcome, Senator.

360
00:38:33,947 --> 00:38:38,202
Corinne Landreaux from US Aid.
May I show you around?

361
00:38:39,953 --> 00:38:43,499
Your boss picked a hell of a place
in the heart of opium country.

362
00:38:44,083 --> 00:38:47,127
My first choice was Kansas
but nothing was free.

363
00:38:47,711 --> 00:38:50,297
There's only
mountains and poppies here.

364
00:38:50,839 --> 00:38:55,636
You stay two, three weeks here?
At best, then we leave.

365
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:58,972
This is noble work you do.

366
00:38:59,556 --> 00:39:04,061
Thank you, Senator.
I'll see you at the plane. Bye.

367
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,150
Look at him operate!

368
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:14,238
He's shanghaiing men and boys
for his private army.

369
00:39:14,822 --> 00:39:18,075
That's an ugly word.
What would you call it?

370
00:39:18,659 --> 00:39:21,495
I'd say he's showing charisma.
Charisma?

371
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:26,000
These people have
different values than we do.

372
00:39:26,583 --> 00:39:30,379
But the nice part is we're all
pulling together for the same cause.

373
00:39:30,963 --> 00:39:32,548
The same cause?

374
00:39:33,132 --> 00:39:35,801
Soong's only cause is General Soong.
Don't you get it?

375
00:39:36,385 --> 00:39:41,140
The CIA flies drugs for him
so he loans us his troops.

376
00:39:41,724 --> 00:39:44,643
You know what?
You've been working your butt off

377
00:39:45,227 --> 00:39:49,440
under the hot sun
and God bless you for it.

378
00:39:50,232 --> 00:39:52,443
But you're starting to rave.

379
00:39:53,235 --> 00:39:55,237
I think you need a vacation.

380
00:39:59,491 --> 00:40:00,492
Have a nice day.

381
00:40:01,076 --> 00:40:02,911
Thanks for coming.

382
00:40:03,495 --> 00:40:07,624
You do me great honor
for come to Nino's, Excellency.

383
00:40:08,208 --> 00:40:10,127
Thank you, Nino.

384
00:40:14,631 --> 00:40:16,842
I'm concerned, gentlemen.

385
00:40:17,426 --> 00:40:19,762
We're not children in Congress.
General Song...

386
00:40:20,346 --> 00:40:24,975
Soong.
Is up to something with opium.

387
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:28,520
Now, nobody's perfect
not even our allies.

388
00:40:30,689 --> 00:40:35,944
But seriously, when we hear rumors
of Americans taking drug money

389
00:40:36,528 --> 00:40:40,991
it endangers the entire war.
Now I want to know the truth.

390
00:40:42,743 --> 00:40:45,454
I'm afraid
we've been keeping the truth from you.

391
00:40:46,038 --> 00:40:50,709
We suspect that our planes
are being used to fly Opium

392
00:40:51,293 --> 00:40:53,003
from the highlands
to Vientiane

393
00:40:53,587 --> 00:40:55,756
where it is processed into heroin.
Dear God.

394
00:40:58,217 --> 00:41:00,594
Why wasn't I told before?

395
00:41:01,178 --> 00:41:03,681
We've made a grave mistake.

396
00:41:05,349 --> 00:41:08,060
We were trying to protect
the good name of our pilots, sir.

397
00:41:08,936 --> 00:41:10,688
You mean our pilots...

398
00:41:12,606 --> 00:41:14,566
...are smuggling narcotics?

399
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:19,446
Not all of 'em, sir.
Just a few bad apples.

400
00:41:20,114 --> 00:41:22,491
They know we can't
inspect every piece of cargo.

401
00:41:23,075 --> 00:41:25,077
So they take advantage of our trust.

402
00:41:26,245 --> 00:41:28,831
Do you know who they are?
We'll find out.

403
00:41:29,498 --> 00:41:34,086
I pledge to you
we'll find those rotten apples.

404
00:42:24,845 --> 00:42:27,306
Hey, General.
What's the cargo?

405
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:29,808
None of your business.

406
00:42:32,019 --> 00:42:33,562
Your cargo's loaded.

407
00:42:35,481 --> 00:42:37,733
Here's your co pilot.

408
00:42:39,193 --> 00:42:41,278
Enjoy the animals, fellas.

409
00:42:44,656 --> 00:42:45,532
What?

410
00:42:46,408 --> 00:42:48,619
I got a bad feeling this morning.

411
00:42:49,328 --> 00:42:52,456
Don't worry, we won't run into
any golden BB'S, OK?

412
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:56,168
I'll be your good luck charm.
No bullets.

413
00:43:13,686 --> 00:43:16,563
Rice drop's first
then the 3 little pigs.

414
00:43:17,147 --> 00:43:19,400
There's no sign on the last one.

415
00:43:19,983 --> 00:43:22,569
General Soong
supervised the loading.

416
00:43:23,862 --> 00:43:25,155
So, what would that be?

417
00:43:28,534 --> 00:43:30,077
Come up to a 12 o'clock.

418
00:43:34,415 --> 00:43:36,500
First drop zone coming up!

419
00:43:39,169 --> 00:43:40,337
Stand by!

420
00:43:42,548 --> 00:43:43,716
Coming up on it.

421
00:43:46,593 --> 00:43:47,761
Looking good.

422
00:43:48,512 --> 00:43:49,513
Air speed's good.

423
00:43:51,682 --> 00:43:53,017
Altitude's good.

424
00:43:59,857 --> 00:44:00,566
Three.

425
00:44:01,483 --> 00:44:02,443
Two.

426
00:44:03,068 --> 00:44:04,278
One.

427
00:44:05,237 --> 00:44:05,863
Now!

428
00:44:14,788 --> 00:44:16,457
Kwan went out the back!
What?

429
00:44:17,041 --> 00:44:19,084
Has she got a chute?

430
00:44:19,668 --> 00:44:21,962
No.
What? We gotta go back!

431
00:44:22,546 --> 00:44:25,507
No. You never go back.
What do you mean?

432
00:44:26,091 --> 00:44:30,846
You just lost your kicker!
You never go back.

433
00:44:36,185 --> 00:44:38,062
Jesus Christ
you meet someone and they die.

434
00:44:40,105 --> 00:44:43,859
They should always wear chutes.

435
00:44:51,116 --> 00:44:52,159
Hey, come on!

436
00:44:54,662 --> 00:44:56,121
That's not funny! OK?

437
00:44:56,789 --> 00:44:58,624
That's not funny!

438
00:45:06,590 --> 00:45:08,550
Billy, how's it going?

439
00:45:09,968 --> 00:45:10,427
Great.

440
00:45:15,349 --> 00:45:17,559
Listen.
Nino's got lobster tonight

441
00:45:18,143 --> 00:45:21,522
but you gotta order in advance.
You up for some of that?

442
00:45:22,106 --> 00:45:25,234
Lobster again?
If I'm still alive I'd like some.

443
00:45:25,818 --> 00:45:27,945
Good, I'll radio in

444
00:45:28,529 --> 00:45:33,242
a reservation.
9 o'clock OK for you guys?

445
00:45:33,826 --> 00:45:36,495
Great
Rodger that.

446
00:45:38,288 --> 00:45:39,790
Hell of a war, man.

447
00:45:41,834 --> 00:45:44,545
340. 12 o'clock coming up.

448
00:45:45,129 --> 00:45:46,463
Stand by.

449
00:45:54,596 --> 00:45:55,681
Comin' up on it.

450
00:45:56,265 --> 00:45:57,307
Three. Two.

451
00:45:58,600 --> 00:45:59,560
One.

452
00:46:00,269 --> 00:46:01,061
Now!

453
00:46:23,417 --> 00:46:24,877
Shit!

454
00:46:26,670 --> 00:46:27,379
Quit it!

455
00:46:31,759 --> 00:46:32,760
Oh man.

456
00:46:33,886 --> 00:46:36,388
Who's shooting at us?
Here? Everybody.

457
00:46:40,976 --> 00:46:44,605
I'm not gonna die
dropping pigs from the sky.

458
00:46:45,773 --> 00:46:49,818
The golden BB.
I knew it.

459
00:46:50,444 --> 00:46:53,614
Just a question of when.
I knew you were coming.

460
00:46:54,198 --> 00:46:56,325
I saw it in the mirror this morning

461
00:46:56,909 --> 00:47:00,663
when I cut myself shaving.
I saw it, bright as the sun.

462
00:47:07,044 --> 00:47:09,546
Jack, we're hit in number 2!
Extinguisher!

463
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:12,341
There goes an engine. Of course.

464
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:19,056
Hey! Wake up, man!

465
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:21,725
Check the oil pressure.

466
00:47:22,309 --> 00:47:25,938
Check the oil pressure!
Dropping.

467
00:47:26,522 --> 00:47:28,273
Check number 1!

468
00:47:28,857 --> 00:47:29,608
Number 1 OK.

469
00:47:30,818 --> 00:47:33,570
Is 9:30 okay? Nino says
he can't get us a table earlier.

470
00:47:34,154 --> 00:47:36,865
Gene, we're hit, throwing fuel!
We're going down!

471
00:47:37,449 --> 00:47:40,035
You still in gun range?
Yes.

472
00:47:40,953 --> 00:47:44,665
Change altitude and heading
every few seconds. Gimme a location.

473
00:47:47,292 --> 00:47:50,129
Jack! Got a minute? Location!
Stop snoozing!

474
00:47:53,132 --> 00:47:54,800
2 miles south of Tango 7.

475
00:47:56,093 --> 00:48:00,389
There's a strip just the other
side of Tango 7. Can you make it?

476
00:48:00,973 --> 00:48:02,099
Doubt it!

477
00:48:02,683 --> 00:48:04,393
Come on, man. You can make it.

478
00:48:05,144 --> 00:48:08,731
Jeez, I'll make it.
10 degrees right.

479
00:48:09,314 --> 00:48:10,983
Welcome back!

480
00:48:12,568 --> 00:48:13,444
Did I leave?

481
00:48:18,741 --> 00:48:22,411
Wild Dog to base.
Pilots in jeopardy near Tango 7.

482
00:48:22,995 --> 00:48:24,997
Am heading over there.

483
00:48:25,581 --> 00:48:28,417
Maintain course, Wild Dog.
We'll send a recon plane.

484
00:48:29,001 --> 00:48:31,378
Wild Dog, you copy?

485
00:48:31,962 --> 00:48:33,589
Wild Dog to base. Fuck off.

486
00:48:38,886 --> 00:48:40,304
Where we at?

487
00:48:41,096 --> 00:48:42,514
You see it?
No.

488
00:48:43,098 --> 00:48:44,391
1 o'clock.

489
00:48:45,726 --> 00:48:47,728
I got it.
Landing gear down!

490
00:48:48,312 --> 00:48:49,188
Coming down.

491
00:48:55,235 --> 00:48:58,614
It's not going down!
Don't worry. Go to manual.

492
00:49:04,578 --> 00:49:07,498
What have we got?
Nothing so far.

493
00:49:08,374 --> 00:49:11,377
We're gonna jump. Kwanh!
Put your 'chute on!

494
00:49:16,924 --> 00:49:19,635
You too, Neely.
Put your 'chute on, man!

495
00:49:20,219 --> 00:49:24,390
I'm riding it in with you.
No! I want you off!

496
00:49:26,767 --> 00:49:31,814
When I level out, jump! OK?
I'm taking it in with you! No!

497
00:49:33,273 --> 00:49:35,401
The only thing God
drops from the sky is bird shit!

498
00:49:35,984 --> 00:49:37,444
Bird shit and you!

499
00:49:38,028 --> 00:49:41,490
That's new.
Birdshit and catatonic pilots.

500
00:49:42,074 --> 00:49:43,242
Jump!

501
00:49:51,917 --> 00:49:53,377
OK, you're next!

502
00:49:54,628 --> 00:49:57,631
You're most vulnerable
floating down in a 'chute.

503
00:49:58,215 --> 00:50:00,050
I'll get a golden BB up my ass!

504
00:50:00,634 --> 00:50:04,430
If it doesn't open
I can use my reserve...

505
00:50:05,014 --> 00:50:06,515
Get up, man! Please!

506
00:50:08,308 --> 00:50:10,269
See you down there. Good luck!

507
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:19,445
I have never had to
jump out of an airplane before!

508
00:50:22,573 --> 00:50:23,866
I'm a fucking den mother!

509
00:50:32,416 --> 00:50:34,543
OK, can you run, man? Let's go!

510
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:48,390
What are you doing back here?

511
00:50:48,974 --> 00:50:51,393
I forgot my Nikon!
Here it is.

512
00:50:51,977 --> 00:50:54,730
You want it? Then jump!
Yes!

513
00:50:55,773 --> 00:50:57,441
You put on your parachute!

514
00:50:58,025 --> 00:50:59,485
I'm afraid of heights.

515
00:51:13,916 --> 00:51:14,792
Jump!

516
00:51:16,752 --> 00:51:17,961
Jump!

517
00:51:18,629 --> 00:51:19,546
Bye, now!

518
00:54:01,959 --> 00:54:04,461
Billy, come in.

519
00:54:18,642 --> 00:54:21,395
You satisfied or disappointed
that we're alive?

520
00:54:21,979 --> 00:54:26,275
The jungle is full of Commies
bandits, and headhunters.

521
00:54:26,859 --> 00:54:28,861
We're not alive yet.

522
00:54:30,612 --> 00:54:33,824
Want a piece of Juicy Fruit?
No, I do not.

523
00:54:34,408 --> 00:54:36,076
We going home!

524
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:39,621
Soon, Kwanh.
No. We go now. Look!

525
00:54:42,249 --> 00:54:44,209
Look, we going home.

526
00:55:28,462 --> 00:55:29,755
Good afternoon!

527
00:55:34,134 --> 00:55:35,427
Hiya, General.

528
00:55:38,847 --> 00:55:40,432
Guess you missed us back there.

529
00:55:41,016 --> 00:55:44,770
Sure is nice
to see some "friendlies" down here.

530
00:55:46,021 --> 00:55:48,107
It's got a couple dings on it.

531
00:55:48,982 --> 00:55:52,236
Sure hope they don't
take it out of my paycheck.

532
00:55:53,988 --> 00:55:56,907
Nothin' a coupla days in the
shop won't fix...

533
00:55:59,243 --> 00:56:00,619
Lemme give you a hand.

534
00:56:07,501 --> 00:56:10,004
Guess you're in a hurry, huh?

535
00:56:11,588 --> 00:56:12,673
God, these are heavy!

536
00:56:13,257 --> 00:56:16,010
Gonna be a tight squeeze, huh?

537
00:56:16,593 --> 00:56:17,302
Hey, man!

538
00:56:19,513 --> 00:56:20,973
What about us?

539
00:56:26,228 --> 00:56:27,646
You're leaving us here?

540
00:56:29,398 --> 00:56:30,858
Goddammit! Fuck!

541
00:56:47,541 --> 00:56:49,626
We not go home now.

542
00:56:50,210 --> 00:56:52,463
Opium go home now.

543
00:56:53,213 --> 00:56:57,343
There was opium on that?
Opium, you got it.

544
00:56:58,761 --> 00:57:00,554
And he took it instead of us?

545
00:57:01,138 --> 00:57:03,599
You helped him load it, pal.

546
00:57:15,069 --> 00:57:19,198
You go north of the strip, I'll look
here. We'll find 'em.

547
00:57:19,782 --> 00:57:22,910
If we hurry we can still make
that 9:30 table at Nino's.

548
00:57:23,494 --> 00:57:25,829
Sounds good, Gene. See ya!

549
00:57:30,709 --> 00:57:33,170
Where is everybody?

550
00:57:37,925 --> 00:57:39,677
Quit it, OK?

551
00:58:00,406 --> 00:58:04,535
Trouble for our boys
off your right wing, jungle's

552
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:07,079
crawlin' with black pyjamas.

553
00:58:35,858 --> 00:58:36,859
Billy, move!

554
00:59:02,092 --> 00:59:03,344
I quit!

555
00:59:19,485 --> 00:59:20,319
Any extra holes?

556
00:59:20,903 --> 00:59:24,615
No.
Wild Dog to base enemy at Tango 7.

557
00:59:25,199 --> 00:59:28,994
Everyone's unfriendly here.
Even the "friendlies!"

558
00:59:30,371 --> 00:59:33,207
Why are they so unfriendly?
They haven't gotten to know us yet.

559
00:59:36,627 --> 00:59:37,544
Why are they shooting?

560
00:59:38,128 --> 00:59:40,798
'Cause they're unfriendly.

561
00:59:48,305 --> 00:59:52,643
You're losing oil pressure...
I already lost tail rotor response.

562
00:59:54,895 --> 00:59:57,231
Put on your belt!

563
00:59:59,858 --> 01:00:05,114
I don't want to crash twice today!
But my crashes are the best!

564
01:00:05,990 --> 01:00:07,866
You're at 40!

565
01:00:10,911 --> 01:00:12,413
You're redlining!

566
01:00:13,372 --> 01:00:15,624
You're redlining!

567
01:00:18,752 --> 01:00:21,422
Autorotate!
Wild Dog to base.

568
01:00:22,006 --> 01:00:25,217
We're going in 3/4 of a mile
southwest of Tango 7.

569
01:00:48,741 --> 01:00:52,828
Great rescue, huh?
I thought you had this blessed.

570
01:00:53,412 --> 01:00:56,040
I thought the monk wasn't
really concentrating.

571
01:00:56,623 --> 01:00:58,292
We gotta drop, you know.

572
01:00:58,876 --> 01:01:01,712
No, man.
We gotta, we're sniper bait.

573
01:01:02,296 --> 01:01:05,007
Who goes first?
There's no fast rule

574
01:01:05,591 --> 01:01:09,178
about crashing through the cockpit.
You go first.

575
01:01:09,762 --> 01:01:11,930
I don't want to go first!
I'll go. I don't want to go 2nd!

576
01:01:12,514 --> 01:01:14,767
We'll toss a coin.

577
01:01:15,351 --> 01:01:16,310
Call!

578
01:01:16,894 --> 01:01:17,561
Tails.

579
01:01:19,271 --> 01:01:21,857
Is that heads? Is that tails?
Tails.

580
01:01:22,524 --> 01:01:24,026
Heads.
That's tails. I'll check.

581
01:01:41,335 --> 01:01:42,211
Come on!

582
01:01:43,003 --> 01:01:44,296
It's pretty soft.

583
01:01:45,589 --> 01:01:47,049
I hate going second.

584
01:02:05,275 --> 01:02:08,487
Well that fall
seemed to go pretty well.

585
01:02:20,249 --> 01:02:23,085
We should get moving.

586
01:02:23,711 --> 01:02:26,005
Can you walk?
Walk?

587
01:02:26,588 --> 01:02:28,924
We're in the goddamned jungle!

588
01:02:54,992 --> 01:02:58,412
Give me voice. Gene. Billy.

589
01:03:01,248 --> 01:03:03,625
Come in, Gene, Billy.

590
01:03:04,418 --> 01:03:05,919
Do you read me?

591
01:03:23,312 --> 01:03:26,148
Gene and Billy, where are you?

592
01:03:32,154 --> 01:03:34,698
Billy and Gene, do you read me?

593
01:03:56,345 --> 01:03:58,681
I stole some stuff as a kid.

594
01:03:59,932 --> 01:04:02,893
Whiffle balls, model airplanes.

595
01:04:03,435 --> 01:04:06,355
I used a fake I D to drink
smoked some reefers.

596
01:04:06,897 --> 01:04:08,732
I performed oral sex
where it's against the law.

597
01:04:09,274 --> 01:04:13,237
But until I worked for my own
government, I never smuggled drugs.

598
01:04:13,779 --> 01:04:16,949
We're not smugglers
just pack mules.

599
01:04:17,491 --> 01:04:21,286
No one wins war here without
control of the opium trade.

600
01:04:21,829 --> 01:04:25,916
We help Soong get his crop to market.
He helps us fight the war.

601
01:04:26,458 --> 01:04:28,669
Don't give me
that cooled out Buddhist shit!

602
01:04:29,211 --> 01:04:32,589
Our government is running a war
with drug money

603
01:04:33,132 --> 01:04:35,509
and our GI's are getting
strung out in Vietnam!

604
01:04:36,051 --> 01:04:39,013
You might as well throw rattlesnakes
in the schoolyard!

605
01:04:40,014 --> 01:04:43,934
This doesn't bother your soul?
Leave my soul out of this.

606
01:04:44,476 --> 01:04:48,063
We don't work officially for the
US government.

607
01:04:48,605 --> 01:04:54,278
Everybody knows.
What happens if you say CIA?

608
01:04:59,783 --> 01:05:03,162
Let's change course. Maybe
we'll be outta here by morning.

609
01:05:03,704 --> 01:05:05,664
How many more miles?

610
01:05:20,804 --> 01:05:24,641
When the sales rep from
Bell Helicopters gets here

611
01:05:25,184 --> 01:05:30,064
go easy on him, not like that
asshole from Dow Chemicals.

612
01:05:30,606 --> 01:05:33,150
Nice and easy. Bring him here

613
01:05:33,692 --> 01:05:36,945
vintage wine
blah blah blah, elegant dining

614
01:05:37,488 --> 01:05:40,407
get him blown at the White Rose

615
01:05:40,949 --> 01:05:45,913
brandy, espresso. Then just
hit him up for the two free choppers.

616
01:05:46,455 --> 01:05:49,458
I'm a little nervous about it.
Buona sera, signore.

617
01:05:50,417 --> 01:05:52,503
I have heard about
the pilots shooted down.

618
01:05:53,045 --> 01:05:55,923
I hope they safe. I pray for them.

619
01:05:56,465 --> 01:05:58,967
Thank you. Every prayer helps.

620
01:06:05,432 --> 01:06:09,144
I have to have coffee with Davenport.
What should I do?

621
01:06:09,687 --> 01:06:12,523
I'll take him to the White Rose.
I'll get him blown.

622
01:06:13,065 --> 01:06:14,316
No.
No. What?

623
01:06:14,858 --> 01:06:18,237
Davenport runs
the Senate prayer group.

624
01:06:18,779 --> 01:06:21,949
With him, you don't
bring up the subject of blow jobs.

625
01:06:22,908 --> 01:06:24,451
You let him bring it up.

626
01:06:35,254 --> 01:06:36,171
Jesus!

627
01:06:36,714 --> 01:06:37,673
Again?

628
01:06:38,215 --> 01:06:41,051
Restaurant closed!
Health violation.

629
01:06:41,593 --> 01:06:43,053
All go home now!

630
01:06:43,595 --> 01:06:45,305
Everybody go now!!

631
01:06:50,477 --> 01:06:54,440
I do business with round eyes
all my life!

632
01:06:54,982 --> 01:06:57,568
But I don't let a
Corsican fuck me!

633
01:06:58,110 --> 01:06:58,861
You crazy?

634
01:06:59,403 --> 01:07:02,197
I pick up opium myself!
In bad danger!

635
01:07:02,740 --> 01:07:05,367
Your men
don't want to pay same same last time!

636
01:07:05,909 --> 01:07:09,079
No more break this china!
Understand?

637
01:07:10,706 --> 01:07:12,082
Now I tell you something.

638
01:07:12,624 --> 01:07:15,085
I talk to Marseilles.
I talk to New York.

639
01:07:16,128 --> 01:07:18,130
They say Opium not so good this year.

640
01:07:18,672 --> 01:07:22,051
Been cut with baking powder.
So who fucking who?

641
01:07:22,593 --> 01:07:25,971
No, I no gonna pay you same same.
You give me shit!

642
01:07:26,597 --> 01:07:30,976
Nino. You listen to me.
You pay same same

643
01:07:31,810 --> 01:07:34,355
or you never use my planes again.

644
01:07:39,193 --> 01:07:41,111
OK, pay same same.

645
01:08:28,325 --> 01:08:30,452
So this is
the face of modern Communism?

646
01:08:30,995 --> 01:08:34,373
Wrong. A devout Communist
carries an AK 47

647
01:08:34,915 --> 01:08:37,626
they have the
oldest weapons known to man.

648
01:08:38,168 --> 01:08:40,838
These are hillbillies.

649
01:08:41,755 --> 01:08:45,926
And they're pissed.
They don't cotton to outsiders.

650
01:08:56,603 --> 01:08:58,564
What're they saying?

651
01:08:59,982 --> 01:09:02,276
I'm surprised
they haven't killed us yet.

652
01:09:02,818 --> 01:09:05,529
Surprised?
How come you're so relaxed?

653
01:09:06,071 --> 01:09:11,243
Don't you get it? When you die
that's it! Blackness.

654
01:09:12,119 --> 01:09:14,663
They stick you in a box
in the ground.

655
01:09:15,205 --> 01:09:18,250
Don't even let you
out on weekends. Depressing.

656
01:09:18,792 --> 01:09:20,044
Right. Nothing.

657
01:09:20,794 --> 01:09:23,130
Buddha says...
Stop it!

658
01:09:23,672 --> 01:09:26,425
A real Buddhist
wouldn't be running guns.

659
01:09:27,968 --> 01:09:32,973
You're a hustler. Call it
Religion, but you're a hustler.

660
01:09:33,807 --> 01:09:36,894
I never said
I was a good Buddhist.

661
01:09:41,065 --> 01:09:42,775
They're gonna do it.

662
01:09:45,277 --> 01:09:47,154
You don't need to speed things up!

663
01:09:48,197 --> 01:09:51,241
Those guns are all wrong
for the rainy conditions.

664
01:09:51,784 --> 01:09:54,328
You need all weather weapons.

665
01:09:54,870 --> 01:10:00,376
Your guns were made in France
for the desert warfare.

666
01:10:02,586 --> 01:10:07,091
I hope you didn't pay
more than two pigs for it.

667
01:10:08,884 --> 01:10:09,718
A cow.

668
01:10:10,678 --> 01:10:12,221
Yeah, I know.

669
01:10:12,763 --> 01:10:16,350
A cow?
For a stupid musket?

670
01:10:18,644 --> 01:10:20,270
You got taken!

671
01:10:21,438 --> 01:10:24,608
D'ya hear?
A cow for this gun!

672
01:10:25,150 --> 01:10:27,027
Isn't that hysterical?

673
01:10:29,154 --> 01:10:32,199
Ever shot it in the rain?

674
01:10:38,247 --> 01:10:39,665
I reckon.

675
01:10:40,207 --> 01:10:41,834
For all weather guns

676
01:10:42,376 --> 01:10:45,546
at great prices.

677
01:10:46,088 --> 01:10:48,048
We should go to my brother in law.

678
01:10:48,632 --> 01:10:49,925
He lives

679
01:10:50,467 --> 01:10:53,554
two days walk from here.
What do you think?

680
01:10:54,096 --> 01:10:57,766
Gentlemen, these guns are cherry.

681
01:11:04,106 --> 01:11:05,941
Deal.

682
01:11:12,031 --> 01:11:14,116
Hello? Mei ling?

683
01:11:24,126 --> 01:11:26,628
I missed you!
Oh, I couldn't tell.

684
01:11:47,107 --> 01:11:48,359
This is my wife.

685
01:11:48,901 --> 01:11:51,654
Come in to civilization
and get cleaned up!

686
01:11:56,784 --> 01:11:59,995
You don't look like a guy
who'd live in a place like this.

687
01:12:03,332 --> 01:12:05,834
Looks'll fool you every time.

688
01:12:06,752 --> 01:12:08,253
What the fuck are you doing here?

689
01:12:08,796 --> 01:12:10,422
Do you believe in this war?

690
01:12:11,757 --> 01:12:14,176
I used to believe in all these wars.

691
01:12:17,137 --> 01:12:18,972
I had a theory once.

692
01:12:19,515 --> 01:12:22,226
The politics of Saturday night.

693
01:12:23,268 --> 01:12:27,815
I rated all countries on how good
their Saturday nights were.

694
01:12:28,357 --> 01:12:32,236
I knew that Moscow and Peking
were a stone drag on Saturday.

695
01:12:34,071 --> 01:12:37,241
So I was flying for a cause.

696
01:12:37,783 --> 01:12:40,953
To defend barbecues
and weenie roasts

697
01:12:41,495 --> 01:12:45,874
and Ray Charles songs and
Southern Comfort 'till you pass out.

698
01:12:47,042 --> 01:12:49,878
The politics of Saturday night.
I can relate.

699
01:12:50,421 --> 01:12:53,924
Not bad is it?
But not particularly true.

700
01:12:54,466 --> 01:12:56,802
I hear they party hard in Moscow.

701
01:12:57,511 --> 01:13:01,515
Don't give up a good theory
just because it's not true.

702
01:13:16,238 --> 01:13:18,407
So why don't you go home?

703
01:13:21,076 --> 01:13:25,205
Look at me, Neely, the rest.
We're trouble junkies.

704
01:13:25,748 --> 01:13:29,460
Nothing but adrenaline gets us off.
It's kinda sick.

705
01:13:31,045 --> 01:13:35,090
Quit before you pick up the habit.
And you will!

706
01:13:37,426 --> 01:13:41,555
Go back to LA and be
the weirdest guy in the room again.

707
01:13:42,097 --> 01:13:44,266
I gotta take care of something first.

708
01:13:45,642 --> 01:13:48,646
You wanna get even?

709
01:13:49,647 --> 01:13:51,398
With who? Rob? Soong?

710
01:13:53,817 --> 01:13:56,236
Forget it! This is the orient.

711
01:13:56,779 --> 01:13:59,907
What Soong did to you was nothing!

712
01:14:01,784 --> 01:14:05,913
I've seen things here
that I never could have imagined.

713
01:14:06,455 --> 01:14:09,208
And I have a broad imagination.

714
01:14:09,708 --> 01:14:13,045
Why don't you just go home.

715
01:14:15,130 --> 01:14:18,509
This is one of the most famous
temples in Laos.

716
01:14:19,051 --> 01:14:20,803
I've been here four days.

717
01:14:21,345 --> 01:14:24,848
I've seen 19 Buddhas
3 tailors, a silk factory

718
01:14:25,391 --> 01:14:28,185
and you haven't told me
one new thing about the dope trade.

719
01:14:28,727 --> 01:14:32,106
I'm leaving soon and
I'm not going back empty handed.

720
01:14:32,648 --> 01:14:35,234
I need heads on a platter

721
01:14:36,777 --> 01:14:40,990
or the rumors will get you
on the hill. What rumors?

722
01:14:41,532 --> 01:14:43,701
You heard the man, Rob.

723
01:14:44,660 --> 01:14:46,620
Heads on a platter.

724
01:15:19,361 --> 01:15:21,572
Is that Paul Bunyan's condom?

725
01:15:23,449 --> 01:15:25,826
That's the point of the drop.

726
01:15:26,368 --> 01:15:28,704
Penis size is very
important to Asian people.

727
01:15:29,246 --> 01:15:33,834
If we can convince them that
American men use this jumbo size

728
01:15:34,376 --> 01:15:37,880
their men will start to fear us.

729
01:15:40,007 --> 01:15:43,135
Dismissed. One more thing, guys.

730
01:15:45,929 --> 01:15:49,683
Jack Neely's body
was recovered last night.

731
01:15:51,101 --> 01:15:53,354
He was shot down by the Pathet Lao

732
01:15:53,896 --> 01:15:56,398
while looking for Covington and Ryack.

733
01:15:58,359 --> 01:16:01,445
I understand how you must feel

734
01:16:01,987 --> 01:16:05,908
but in the interest of security
you must be quiet about it.

735
01:16:06,450 --> 01:16:10,204
Before you keep us quiet again
could we have a moment of silence?

736
01:16:40,526 --> 01:16:43,487
"Visit colorful native village"
reads my schedule, Gene.

737
01:16:44,029 --> 01:16:47,992
But we've been here 6 hours.
I think we can say I've seen it.

738
01:16:48,534 --> 01:16:51,453
They're nearly finished.

739
01:16:51,996 --> 01:16:55,082
What is that, Gene? A boat?

740
01:16:56,166 --> 01:16:57,376
Sort of.

741
01:16:57,918 --> 01:17:00,921
You a strange man, Gene.

742
01:17:02,172 --> 01:17:04,008
Thank you for noticing, General.

743
01:17:04,550 --> 01:17:08,012
You love old ways.
Asian ways.

744
01:17:08,554 --> 01:17:10,889
General Soong love

745
01:17:11,432 --> 01:17:14,852
tomorrow ways. Modern world.

746
01:17:20,024 --> 01:17:22,735
Our friend here's a little tipsy.

747
01:17:24,528 --> 01:17:27,156
He's high on America.
I've seen it before.

748
01:17:27,698 --> 01:17:31,160
It's stronger than whisky.
Bigger than opium.

749
01:17:32,870 --> 01:17:35,581
He's stoned on
dreams of the USA.

750
01:17:39,251 --> 01:17:40,794
Gene, you just mentioned opium.

751
01:17:42,796 --> 01:17:45,215
Now, tell me
let the chips fall where they may.

752
01:17:45,758 --> 01:17:48,969
Was Jack Neely flying dope
when he went down?

753
01:17:59,271 --> 01:18:01,774
Let's take this to the plane.

754
01:18:02,316 --> 01:18:03,776
You're taking that kayak with you?

755
01:18:04,318 --> 01:18:06,945
This is Jack Neely's coffin.

756
01:18:07,488 --> 01:18:10,866
I promised him they wouldn't
send him home in a body bag.

757
01:18:11,408 --> 01:18:14,536
And, no, he wasn't flying dope.

758
01:18:15,704 --> 01:18:16,914
General! Wake up!

759
01:18:21,251 --> 01:18:23,671
I'm here to drink to Jack Neely.
Join me?

760
01:18:27,132 --> 01:18:27,966
To Jack!

761
01:18:29,051 --> 01:18:32,054
He wanted it like that. He'd have
been real angry to die in bed.

762
01:18:45,359 --> 01:18:50,656
I'm leaving. I sent Mei Ling
and the kids ahead. What the fuck?

763
01:18:51,198 --> 01:18:55,244
I've got a buyer for all my guns.
I'm gonna pick 'em all up

764
01:18:55,786 --> 01:19:01,250
and sell 'em in one hit.
You gonna be a farmer in Thailand?

765
01:19:03,335 --> 01:19:05,462
What about the rest of us?

766
01:19:06,005 --> 01:19:09,758
Should we go home and sell
aluminum siding?

767
01:19:10,300 --> 01:19:12,136
They're gonna shut this war down soon.

768
01:19:12,678 --> 01:19:16,265
There'll be a new one opening
in a theatre near you.

769
01:19:16,807 --> 01:19:18,767
Promise?
I promise.

770
01:19:23,397 --> 01:19:26,650
I was with the Senator all day.

771
01:19:27,192 --> 01:19:30,863
The spooks are lookin' for fall guys.
So watch out.

772
01:19:40,956 --> 01:19:42,666
Where you been?

773
01:19:43,208 --> 01:19:44,209
Just around.

774
01:19:45,002 --> 01:19:48,339
I did some shopping
on the black market. Bought grenades.

775
01:19:48,881 --> 01:19:51,675
Now I'm gonna have some fun.

776
01:19:52,217 --> 01:19:54,470
Big fun.

777
01:19:55,012 --> 01:19:56,847
Noisy fun.

778
01:19:57,389 --> 01:19:59,558
Doesn't sound like well planned fun.

779
01:20:00,934 --> 01:20:04,021
Like I said
I tend to fuck up on the ground.

780
01:20:04,688 --> 01:20:06,482
I wouldn't do this if I was you.

781
01:20:07,024 --> 01:20:08,275
I know.

782
01:20:08,984 --> 01:20:11,695
But then you wouldn't do anything.

783
01:20:12,237 --> 01:20:13,155
See you later.

784
01:20:14,156 --> 01:20:16,116
Can I have a soda?

785
01:20:26,919 --> 01:20:28,212
Sure, here you go.

786
01:22:38,509 --> 01:22:41,387
I know who do this! That new kid!

787
01:22:41,929 --> 01:22:44,431
The guards saw him running away.
Word on the street is

788
01:22:44,974 --> 01:22:47,434
it's Communist sabotage.

789
01:22:47,977 --> 01:22:50,604
I don't give a rat's ass who did it.

790
01:22:51,397 --> 01:22:56,360
The whole operation is gonna blow up
in our faces, with the Senator here.

791
01:22:56,902 --> 01:23:00,739
We've got to do some
immediate damage control.

792
01:23:06,704 --> 01:23:10,916
With your indulgence:
Could I have two kilos?

793
01:23:19,133 --> 01:23:22,511
These two kilos are for the cause.

794
01:23:24,972 --> 01:23:25,639
Yes, sir.

795
01:23:30,894 --> 01:23:33,230
That's right, C 123, personal use.

796
01:23:33,772 --> 01:23:35,899
Pretty big for personal use.

797
01:23:36,442 --> 01:23:40,112
You found a buyer for your guns?
Nail on the head.

798
01:23:40,654 --> 01:23:42,531
How you doing?
Very well.

799
01:23:43,073 --> 01:23:47,745
What you taking today?
Flour sacks to Bien Thuong.

800
01:23:48,412 --> 01:23:52,082
That's near Tango 7.
Planning on crashing any planes?

801
01:23:52,624 --> 01:23:57,463
Not today. You already
cost this company enough.

802
01:23:58,005 --> 01:24:00,507
What do you mean?

803
01:24:04,428 --> 01:24:06,972
Feel better?
Much better.

804
01:24:07,514 --> 01:24:11,518
The cloud of opium smoke
in town got everybody high.

805
01:24:12,061 --> 01:24:14,980
You actually shut the plant down
for three whole hours.

806
01:24:15,522 --> 01:24:17,816
Didn't start it 'till this morning.

807
01:24:19,026 --> 01:24:20,319
That's the way it is.

808
01:24:40,089 --> 01:24:42,633
All set?
All set.

809
01:24:48,847 --> 01:24:50,349
Bien Thuong, huh?

810
01:25:28,012 --> 01:25:31,015
You! Move truck out! Quick!

811
01:25:37,313 --> 01:25:39,398
Keep movin', Audrey!

812
01:25:39,940 --> 01:25:41,525
You get truck out!

813
01:25:42,359 --> 01:25:44,486
Hey! Calm down!

814
01:25:45,029 --> 01:25:49,742
You get your opium fields.
We need a few hours to move!

815
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:04,048
Base to Stagger Lee. Come in!

816
01:26:04,590 --> 01:26:06,800
Base to Stagger Lee. Over.

817
01:26:07,343 --> 01:26:11,263
Slight change in you flight plan.
Head to LS 18

818
01:26:11,805 --> 01:26:15,225
for a routine inspection.
Inspection?

819
01:26:15,768 --> 01:26:18,187
Affirmative.
We just read 'em.

820
01:26:19,229 --> 01:26:21,190
Check. Heading for LS 18.

821
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:29,365
I'm going to LS 18
for a routine inspection.

822
01:26:29,907 --> 01:26:32,660
Routine inspection? Never heard of it.

823
01:26:35,204 --> 01:26:37,331
Then it ain't routine.

824
01:26:40,584 --> 01:26:42,336
Babo, check on the cargo.
What's up?

825
01:26:42,878 --> 01:26:45,255
I don't know. Check it, will you?

826
01:27:00,437 --> 01:27:03,732
I hope to God
our information's wrong.

827
01:27:04,274 --> 01:27:06,777
It'd break my heart
if Heroin was on that plane.

828
01:27:07,319 --> 01:27:11,365
The pilot does come from California.
I see.

829
01:27:11,907 --> 01:27:14,034
Caught up in the youth culture bit?

830
01:27:14,576 --> 01:27:17,162
Too much Rock 'n Roll.

831
01:27:18,831 --> 01:27:23,043
Still, he's only one young man.
Why do we need all these men.

832
01:27:23,585 --> 01:27:25,963
Pilots are tough men, Senator.

833
01:27:26,505 --> 01:27:28,841
This one might resist
with force.

834
01:27:29,341 --> 01:27:33,846
Our information says he's
a cool and ruthless customer.

835
01:27:39,143 --> 01:27:40,102
Nothing!

836
01:27:40,644 --> 01:27:43,647
Listen, we're being set up.
Keep looking!

837
01:27:44,189 --> 01:27:46,191
Are you serious?
Yeah, cut 'em open!

838
01:27:55,034 --> 01:27:57,202
What you got?
Nothing.

839
01:28:14,636 --> 01:28:16,305
Hurry up!

840
01:28:18,807 --> 01:28:19,683
Got it!

841
01:28:21,393 --> 01:28:23,354
I knew it!

842
01:28:25,439 --> 01:28:28,901
Look at those bastards
waiting for us!

843
01:28:33,238 --> 01:28:36,992
They want us busted.
Dead and busted.

844
01:28:42,665 --> 01:28:45,626
Somebody messed with the fuel gauge!
We're running out!

845
01:28:47,586 --> 01:28:50,631
I'm heading for Tango 7.

846
01:28:51,173 --> 01:28:54,635
Wait, Billy!
They can follow us there!

847
01:28:55,177 --> 01:28:57,596
We'll figure it out.
Don't say we, man!

848
01:28:58,138 --> 01:29:01,517
I'm 42 and I never figured out
anything in my fuckin' life.

849
01:29:15,197 --> 01:29:18,575
He's not landing, Rob.
He's only got enough fuel to...

850
01:29:21,620 --> 01:29:23,747
Start 'em up! Let's go after 'em!

851
01:29:40,472 --> 01:29:42,891
We're VSF, man!

852
01:29:43,434 --> 01:29:46,103
VSF?
Very severely fucked!

853
01:30:13,339 --> 01:30:17,968
Good flying, Covington.
Ever do any valet parking?

854
01:30:21,055 --> 01:30:23,474
Looks like we're gonna make it.

855
01:30:24,016 --> 01:30:27,186
What are we gonna do on the ground?
I'm workin' on it!

856
01:30:39,198 --> 01:30:40,366
Come on!

857
01:30:40,991 --> 01:30:42,368
Come on!

858
01:31:03,263 --> 01:31:06,558
You're too fast!
Hold on! What?

859
01:31:07,101 --> 01:31:09,144
Pull up! Pull up!

860
01:31:09,687 --> 01:31:12,731
What are you doing?
Shut up!

861
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:16,610
Are you fucking nuts?
Head down, now.

862
01:31:17,152 --> 01:31:18,237
Down!

863
01:31:36,422 --> 01:31:40,092
I never would have thought of it.
It just came to me.

864
01:31:40,634 --> 01:31:42,511
I'm gonna buy you some beers!

865
01:31:49,810 --> 01:31:51,770
Lousy week, man.

866
01:31:52,354 --> 01:31:54,773
Gene, come in, Gene!

867
01:32:00,112 --> 01:32:01,196
Bullshit.

868
01:32:02,197 --> 01:32:03,282
'Scuse me.

869
01:32:05,951 --> 01:32:08,495
It's Babo here. Gene come in!

870
01:32:09,204 --> 01:32:11,165
This is Gene. What's up?

871
01:32:12,041 --> 01:32:16,170
He did it again?
Can't he keep the thing in the air?

872
01:32:16,712 --> 01:32:18,339
I'll think about it.

873
01:32:24,345 --> 01:32:27,348
Nope, no more money.
Speak English.

874
01:33:26,615 --> 01:33:29,284
Where'd he go, Rob?
I don't know!

875
01:33:29,827 --> 01:33:32,329
Well, Senator
looks like we've lost him.

876
01:33:33,872 --> 01:33:37,459
Maybe my trip hasn't
been a complete loss.

877
01:33:38,002 --> 01:33:40,421
Maybe I found those rotten apples
after all.

878
01:33:40,963 --> 01:33:44,675
I beg your pardon, sir?
I may wear shorts in the jungle.

879
01:33:45,217 --> 01:33:49,388
And say, "gosh" and "doo doo"
but I know a frame up when I see one.

880
01:33:50,139 --> 01:33:54,393
Unless my eyes deceive me...
They probably do...

881
01:33:54,935 --> 01:33:57,855
You are a highly decorated soldier...

882
01:33:58,397 --> 01:34:00,816
Senator, kiss my highly decorated ass!

883
01:34:02,484 --> 01:34:06,405
I tried to make it easy for you
but there's no way to please you.

884
01:34:06,947 --> 01:34:09,950
I'll tell you what.
You go back to Washington

885
01:34:10,492 --> 01:34:12,870
go straight to the White House

886
01:34:13,412 --> 01:34:16,540
and pour your heart out
about what you think you saw here.

887
01:34:17,082 --> 01:34:22,046
Then sit back and watch
your political career die.

888
01:34:22,588 --> 01:34:27,176
You can't touch me without
cutting your own throat.

889
01:34:28,802 --> 01:34:31,972
You know why?
Because the President loves my ass!

890
01:34:33,557 --> 01:34:35,517
You really are second level, Rob.

891
01:34:38,479 --> 01:34:40,439
We go home now!

892
01:35:23,899 --> 01:35:26,443
Glad you could make it!

893
01:35:28,070 --> 01:35:31,740
Where's your bus?
Long story.

894
01:35:43,252 --> 01:35:47,506
Well, it's my last stop, boys.
One more pick up, then I off load.

895
01:35:48,048 --> 01:35:50,175
It's gravy from there on in.

896
01:35:51,719 --> 01:35:55,764
I had a map someplace
with the stops marked in crayon.

897
01:35:56,307 --> 01:35:57,766
Here it is.

898
01:35:58,684 --> 01:36:01,020
Navigate me to sky blue, please.

899
01:36:03,188 --> 01:36:04,857
Look at all the "friendlies."

900
01:36:05,399 --> 01:36:08,319
Soong's troops.
Been listening all morning.

901
01:36:09,111 --> 01:36:13,699
He's worried someone'll get
to the poppy fields before him.

902
01:36:14,241 --> 01:36:17,703
That's by the refugee camp, too.
That's where the poppies are.

903
01:36:42,061 --> 01:36:45,439
They're no more trucks
no more choppers.

904
01:36:45,981 --> 01:36:49,652
You go ahead, I'll send a call.
Corinne!

905
01:37:09,713 --> 01:37:13,092
Mayday! This is Scout Camp 1.
Enemy troops are moving in

906
01:37:13,634 --> 01:37:16,845
on General Soong
and we're caught in the cross fire.

907
01:37:17,388 --> 01:37:19,640
Request immediate assistance!

908
01:37:20,766 --> 01:37:23,936
Mayday! This is Scout Camp 1

909
01:37:24,478 --> 01:37:25,896
requesting assistance.

910
01:37:27,481 --> 01:37:30,150
Mayday
we're under heavy mortar fire!

911
01:37:33,028 --> 01:37:36,949
This is Pirelli. We're about 15
minutes away. Anyone closer?

912
01:37:37,783 --> 01:37:41,537
We'll head in if nobody is closer.
Call us, please!

913
01:37:42,621 --> 01:37:46,083
Mayday, mayday! To all aircraft!
We're under heave mortar fire

914
01:37:46,625 --> 01:37:50,004
at Scout Camp 1.
Do you read?

915
01:37:50,546 --> 01:37:54,008
Saunders and Pirelli
are almost as close as we are.

916
01:37:54,550 --> 01:37:57,177
Yeah
we're only about 5 minutes closer.

917
01:37:57,720 --> 01:37:59,054
At the most.

918
01:38:01,181 --> 01:38:02,599
Shut up!

919
01:38:03,142 --> 01:38:06,478
I've planned this day for a long time!
I didn't say anything!

920
01:38:07,021 --> 01:38:09,982
I don't have time to pick up
lost social workers!

921
01:38:10,524 --> 01:38:13,402
She chose to be there herself.

922
01:38:13,944 --> 01:38:16,989
I already pick you guys up.
I appreciate it.

923
01:38:17,531 --> 01:38:20,534
Thank you. She knew
what she was doing.

924
01:38:21,076 --> 01:38:22,411
God dammit!

925
01:38:22,953 --> 01:38:24,997
5 minutes won't kill us.

926
01:38:25,539 --> 01:38:28,667
She's skinny
she'll sit on a machine gun.

927
01:38:29,501 --> 01:38:30,961
Give me the heading.

928
01:38:31,503 --> 01:38:33,672
160. Are you sure?

929
01:38:34,214 --> 01:38:35,758
Shut up!

930
01:38:40,054 --> 01:38:44,099
Keep your hands off the wheel.
We know what happens when you fly.

931
01:38:45,517 --> 01:38:48,646
We haven't heard.
Is anybody coming? Call us.

932
01:38:49,396 --> 01:38:53,067
I was changing in a phone booth.
We'll get her.

933
01:39:20,052 --> 01:39:22,221
This was a good idea of yours!

934
01:40:27,328 --> 01:40:31,206
I knew you guys would make it!
I think we can get everybody on board.

935
01:40:31,749 --> 01:40:34,543
No, we just came back for you.
He's fully loaded.

936
01:40:35,085 --> 01:40:36,420
Dump the fucking cargo!

937
01:40:37,504 --> 01:40:41,550
That's a problem.
I'm not leaving without them.

938
01:40:43,761 --> 01:40:45,596
Let's get this kid and get outta here!

939
01:40:49,642 --> 01:40:50,809
Come on!

940
01:40:52,269 --> 01:40:53,395
Let's go!

941
01:40:59,318 --> 01:41:00,778
Get on the plane.

942
01:41:01,320 --> 01:41:03,322
Not without these people!

943
01:41:03,864 --> 01:41:06,283
We came here to get you.
Get on the fucking plane!

944
01:41:06,825 --> 01:41:08,452
Dump your cargo.

945
01:41:27,513 --> 01:41:28,681
One minute.

946
01:41:30,307 --> 01:41:34,687
I got a crazy idea:
Cargo out, people in.

947
01:41:35,229 --> 01:41:36,313
Great!
Please!

948
01:41:36,855 --> 01:41:38,524
You better hurry.
You gotta do it.

949
01:41:39,066 --> 01:41:42,569
Otherwise you're just a 2nd Lemond
with a hipper rap.

950
01:41:45,364 --> 01:41:46,573
Knock it off, will ya?

951
01:41:54,540 --> 01:41:56,166
Goddamn!

952
01:41:58,043 --> 01:41:59,420
Hey, Mother Theresa!

953
01:41:59,962 --> 01:42:02,798
I was gonna do it anyway.
But I hate being lectured!

954
01:42:27,197 --> 01:42:29,158
"Slightly hipper rap?"

955
01:43:00,397 --> 01:43:02,691
Let's go! Quickly!

956
01:43:09,490 --> 01:43:13,577
Get up front and give it some stick!
Those shells are close.

957
01:44:36,285 --> 01:44:39,330
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome aboard Air America Flight 1.

958
01:44:41,999 --> 01:44:45,502
You can unfasten your seatbelts
as soon as we're out of gun range.

959
01:44:46,211 --> 01:44:48,589
I'd like to
apologize for that ground delay.

960
01:44:49,131 --> 01:44:51,258
We experienced material turbulence.

961
01:44:51,800 --> 01:44:54,928
On entertainment channel 3
you can hear music from

962
01:44:55,471 --> 01:44:59,433
that group "Gene Ryack and
the Redemption!"

963
01:45:00,017 --> 01:45:04,563
The Captain now has to explain to his
family what he did with their savings.

964
01:45:05,105 --> 01:45:06,523
Our flight path

965
01:45:07,066 --> 01:45:10,152
takes us over Anaheim
Azusa and the Mekong Delta

966
01:45:10,694 --> 01:45:12,655
to...

967
01:45:14,782 --> 01:45:15,783
Where we going?

968
01:45:16,325 --> 01:45:20,871
You're gonna help me make
my money back that you lost.

969
01:45:21,413 --> 01:45:24,583
I made you lose it?
I merely suggested.

970
01:45:25,125 --> 01:45:27,503
Do not blame me for the single
decent act of your adult life.

971
01:45:28,253 --> 01:45:30,506
Besides, where do I get the money?

972
01:45:32,383 --> 01:45:38,055
Here at crazy Gene's we've slashed
the prices on used C 123's.

973
01:45:38,597 --> 01:45:40,599
For your private army...
Forget it!

974
01:45:41,141 --> 01:45:43,936
No more problems
with those pesky border troops!

975
01:45:44,478 --> 01:45:46,522
This plane is US Government property.

976
01:45:47,064 --> 01:45:51,026
The US Government doesn't exist
in Laos. Neither does this plane.

977
01:45:52,152 --> 01:45:53,153
Right.

978
01:45:53,696 --> 01:45:57,199
We'll do what we do best.

979
01:45:57,741 --> 01:45:59,243
We fly!
