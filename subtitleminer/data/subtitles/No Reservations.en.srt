00:00:39,293 --> 00:00:44,208
Some chefs calls them "turtledoves",
a very romantic plate.

2
00:00:49,334 --> 00:00:53,275
Well cooked they are so
soft as the butter.

3
00:00:53,693 --> 00:00:56,439
They can be made to the grill,
padded with wild or cooked rice

4
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,161
 ... roasted, poached, to
the fathoms and even fried.

5
00:01:01,716 --> 00:01:04,716
But there is not bigger sin that
to cook too much a quail.

6
00:01:05,389 --> 00:01:09,681
To be perfect, he/she should have
the breast a little rosy.

7
00:01:10,285 --> 00:01:14,223
You need the correct quail. It should
to be fleshy or he/she dries off very quick.

8
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,460
I prefer to serve them roasted.

9
00:01:16,461 --> 00:01:18,647
That gives him/her a flavor

10
00:01:18,648 --> 00:01:21,166
more robust and more succulent.

11
00:01:21,167 --> 00:01:22,706
With a garnish of truffle raviolis

12
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:25,138
and wild mushrooms, are delicious.

13
00:01:25,139 --> 00:01:27,193
Of course, you can also cook them

14
00:01:27,194 --> 00:01:28,167
in a pig bladder.

15
00:01:28,168 --> 00:01:30,767
 ... with a mixture of Madeira and brandy.

16
00:01:30,768 --> 00:01:34,575
The bladder helps to protect the
quail, maintains it juicy.

17
00:01:34,841 --> 00:01:39,580
You can serve it with a soft one
sauce of thyme, chives... 

18
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:42,180
 ... carameled chalotas, truffles.

19
00:01:42,181 --> 00:01:45,084
The truffles go perfectly with
almost any quail plate... 

20
00:01:45,241 --> 00:01:48,124
 ... because they stand out their delicate flavor.

21
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:51,337
Does it feel well?

22
00:01:51,338 --> 00:01:54,220
Very well. It continues.

23
00:01:54,482 --> 00:01:56,705
They increase marvelously

24
00:01:56,706 --> 00:01:59,170
the delicate flavor of the quail.

25
00:01:59,171 --> 00:02:00,524
But, you really have to have

26
00:02:00,525 --> 00:02:01,554
the money to buy the truffles.

27
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:03,698
 ... but, better you forget them.

28
00:02:03,699 --> 00:02:06,582
Now, as appetizer I suggest... 

29
00:02:06,651 --> 00:02:07,870
Kate, would care you... 

30
00:02:07,871 --> 00:02:09,791
if I change topic a moment?

31
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:12,675
- No.
- Why do you come every week?

32
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,963
My boss told me that me
he/she would discharge if he/she didn't go to therapy.

33
00:02:16,127 --> 00:02:19,062
And why you believe that her
does he/she think that you need therapy?

34
00:02:19,267 --> 00:02:21,403
Why?

35
00:02:21,404 --> 00:02:23,894
Does he/she know what?

36
00:02:23,895 --> 00:02:26,777
Not I have the smallest idea.

37
00:02:42,473 --> 00:02:43,642
Two appetizers.

38
00:02:43,643 --> 00:02:46,953
Leah, a quail and a
sole for nine o'clock.

39
00:02:47,127 --> 00:02:50,010
I am still waiting those
fillets. Where are they? Clever!

40
00:02:50,677 --> 00:02:53,560
Terrine, carpaccio.

41
00:02:55,749 --> 00:02:59,069
Chef, Hal Reeves says that the one
lamb has never been better.

42
00:02:59,352 --> 00:03:02,098
Seriously? And him what he/she knows?

43
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:05,080
Kate, Peterson arrived.
They love you how brilliant you are.

44
00:03:05,259 --> 00:03:08,134
Thank them, but the chefs
brilliant they should be in the kitchen.

45
00:03:08,135 --> 00:03:10,349
At least greet them. You know that
they belong to my best clients.

46
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:12,005
In one minute.

47
00:03:12,006 --> 00:03:13,881
Don't cook them too much because... 

48
00:03:13,882 --> 00:03:16,121
- Yes, they become hard. I already know it.
- No, they dry off. They dry off, Leah.

49
00:03:16,122 --> 00:03:17,743
I become hard. The quail dries off.

50
00:03:17,744 --> 00:03:20,627
Kate, I want us to speak
of the menu of next week.

51
00:03:31,188 --> 00:03:33,059
You are a maga, Kate.

52
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,579
And you know that my husband
he/she never stops to eulogize you.

53
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,676
In fact, it could become jealous.

54
00:03:37,677 --> 00:03:40,854
I adore anyone that
it can surprise my palate.

55
00:03:41,064 --> 00:03:43,169
It is always a pleasure
to cook for you.

56
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:45,081
- Will we see you next week, not?
- Of course.

57
00:03:45,082 --> 00:03:47,964
- Good night.
- Good night.

58
00:03:54,121 --> 00:03:56,317
It was a pleasure to see them.

59
00:03:56,318 --> 00:03:58,691
I tell him/her that it is not well cooked.

60
00:03:58,692 --> 00:04:00,959
- Can I ask what it happens?
- Kate, I take charge.

61
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,608
- You should be the chef.
- It is this way.

62
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:05,145
- Wonderful. I want to show him/her something.
- Ken, don't make that.

63
00:04:05,146 --> 00:04:07,564
The foie gras was not cooked enough.

64
00:04:07,565 --> 00:04:08,669
Pardon?

65
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:11,163
I will bring him/her a new one
appetizer, courtesy of the house.

66
00:04:11,164 --> 00:04:13,009
My foie gras is
perfectly cooked.

67
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:16,297
Not he/she has to be embarrassed, pretty. To
all can fail them the foie gras.

68
00:04:16,345 --> 00:04:19,227
This doesn't have anything of bad.
It is perfectly comme d faut.

69
00:04:19,795 --> 00:04:21,909
- What does that mean?
- Comme il faut?

70
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:25,438
"As it should be." 60o in the oven,
26o, in the temperature of the water... 

71
00:04:25,629 --> 00:04:29,756
 ... 25 minutes, neither a lot neither a little,
with the rosy, pretty perfect tone.

72
00:04:30,341 --> 00:04:31,416
Coarse.

73
00:04:31,417 --> 00:04:33,328
We will leave to another part.

74
00:04:33,329 --> 00:04:36,211
Vámonos.

75
00:04:36,927 --> 00:04:41,089
Go to the position of hot dogs of
Vinnie, in the corner. He/she cooks to the order.

76
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:44,898
How many times have I told it to you?

77
00:04:44,899 --> 00:04:47,546
Not you can make a scandal each
time that he doesn't like somebody your food.

78
00:04:47,547 --> 00:04:49,037
Please. That type is a barbarian.

79
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:52,371
And a client that pays. If he says that
the foie gras is not well, it is not well.

80
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,123
The foie gras is cruel for the animals.

81
00:04:54,124 --> 00:04:55,208
- Leah.
- Don't enter.

82
00:04:55,209 --> 00:04:58,763
I swear that if you were not one of the best
chefs of the city, said goodbye to you today.

83
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:01,863
One of the best chefs?!
What does that mean?

84
00:05:02,525 --> 00:05:05,407
Comely to that says
only to bother me.

85
00:05:06,183 --> 00:05:09,065
He/she says it alone to bother me.

86
00:05:09,107 --> 00:05:11,990
- Or not?
- What you say, chef.

87
00:05:43,381 --> 00:05:47,454
Mailbox of messages, not
he/she has any message.

88
00:06:03,392 --> 00:06:05,234
- How are you?
- I am well, Frank.

89
00:06:05,235 --> 00:06:07,072
I have some pretty lobsters of Maine.

90
00:06:07,073 --> 00:06:09,955
That is very small. Better this.

91
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:14,921
Do send them to me before 2:30 o'clock, do you want?
And it sends those squalid ones to Fontaine!

92
00:06:15,136 --> 00:06:17,799
Kate! Who is your best friend?

93
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,627
- Did you get it?
- Didn't you request it to me?

94
00:06:20,627 --> 00:06:23,176
Gilded Blanquillo?

95
00:06:23,177 --> 00:06:24,053
Bob!

96
00:06:24,054 --> 00:06:26,021
- Alone for you!
- They are beautiful.

97
00:06:26,022 --> 00:06:28,724
Beautiful blanquillos
golden, fishes with line.

98
00:06:28,725 --> 00:06:30,322
- Beautiful.
- Give me a kiss.

99
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:33,144
- Bob.
- Give me a kiss.

100
00:06:33,145 --> 00:06:35,499
Why to my he/she didn't play me kiss?

101
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,089
Why didn't he/she play you kiss?
You didn't get him/her anything!

102
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:40,973
- And to this how you call it?
- Not I see any golden blanquillo!

103
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:51,970
Hello?

104
00:06:51,971 --> 00:06:55,734
Hello, I am me! I am reporting myself.
We will arrive like at nine o'clock.

105
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:58,208
Fabulous, I will make sure
of being of return.

106
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:01,570
Well. What are you making?
Reading a recipe. no?

107
00:07:02,723 --> 00:07:05,841
Christine, be not ridiculous.
I have other you interest.

108
00:07:05,976 --> 00:07:07,859
Of course. One mentions.

109
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,037
How is Zoe?

110
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:13,273
Adorable. It has changed a lot
from the last time that you dressed her.

111
00:07:13,535 --> 00:07:15,915
- Is certain affection not?
- I don't know.

112
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:17,591
What will they have dinner?

113
00:07:17,592 --> 00:07:20,475
Don't worry about us. Us
we will eat a pizza or something like that.

114
00:07:20,658 --> 00:07:23,553
Undoubtedly not. What him
does Zoe like these days?

115
00:07:23,794 --> 00:07:26,603
He/she eats any thing. It is a vacuum cleaner.

116
00:07:26,604 --> 00:07:27,539
Mom!

117
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:30,836
I will call you when it is close.
Say goodbye to your aunt Kate.

118
00:07:31,028 --> 00:07:33,912
- Good-bye, aunt Kate!
- Good-bye, aunt Kate!

119
00:07:39,099 --> 00:07:40,541
Hello, Kate. You have just arrived?

120
00:07:40,542 --> 00:07:42,062
No, I forgot something.

121
00:07:42,063 --> 00:07:44,009
- How are you?
- Well.

122
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:47,046
Do you work tonight? I know a
Thai fabulous restaurant.

123
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:49,524
I will work. Alone a couple of hours.

124
00:07:49,525 --> 00:07:51,445
My sister and my niece
they will come to visit one another.

125
00:07:51,446 --> 00:07:55,016
I don't surrender easily. A day of these
I will convince you of go to have dinner with me.

126
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:00,303
Be, you should already know
that I don't usually make that.

127
00:08:01,627 --> 00:08:04,150
- What thing? To have dinner?
- To leave to have dinner with somebody.

128
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:05,287
And to have breakfast?

129
00:08:05,288 --> 00:08:07,023
You live in my building.

130
00:08:07,024 --> 00:08:10,300
Not I go out with anybody that lives
in my building. It is a rule.

131
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:13,733
It seems that you have many rules.

132
00:08:18,232 --> 00:08:20,248
Not you did say that you forgot something?

133
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:23,132
- Ah, thank you. Yes.
- Of anything.

134
00:08:35,591 --> 00:08:38,423
What does he/she have of bad to have rules?

135
00:08:38,424 --> 00:08:40,752
Not I am controladora neither anything of that.

136
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:43,247
Alone I prefer that the things
be made correctly.

137
00:08:43,248 --> 00:08:46,090
For that reason finished
making everything myself.

138
00:08:46,091 --> 00:08:49,732
He/she has idea of that complicated that
is it to coordinate 40 plates at the same time?

139
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,661
I hope he likes scallops.

140
00:08:53,662 --> 00:08:57,210
Not we had been in that
would you no longer cook for my?

141
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,031
I don't make it for you,
alone I prove new ideas.

142
00:09:00,032 --> 00:09:02,915
To who will I give it if not?

143
00:09:04,233 --> 00:09:07,116
We will attempt something new this week.

144
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:10,770
I will make you wonder
and you will respond them.

145
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:14,422
Does he/she make how much your last relationship was?

146
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,690
Is that not a little personal?

147
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:20,937
Good, it is a therapy.

148
00:09:20,938 --> 00:09:23,268
Does he/she make how much?

149
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:26,151
Not I know. Three years. Maybe four.

150
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:27,503
Who did finish it?

151
00:09:27,504 --> 00:09:30,323
Me. It was becoming very demanding.

152
00:09:30,324 --> 00:09:32,167
In what sense?

153
00:09:32,168 --> 00:09:36,088
After two years he/she wanted
that we lived together.

154
00:09:36,662 --> 00:09:39,545
Did it prove the sauce of saffron?

155
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:43,073
Pardon, what does he/she have of bad to live together?

156
00:09:43,366 --> 00:09:46,249
It asked me him to leave my apartment.

157
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:48,290
Why will that make?

158
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:52,695
He/she would leave it, we would live in another side,
would he leave me then and then what?

159
00:09:52,977 --> 00:09:55,723
My God.

160
00:09:55,724 --> 00:09:58,606
How rich the sauce is.

161
00:09:59,642 --> 00:10:02,525
Thank you.

162
00:10:03,455 --> 00:10:05,380
Where is my lobster for 12 o'clock?

163
00:10:05,381 --> 00:10:07,815
It lists, chef.

164
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:10,315
I am an actress and I don't make movies
with naked scenes of submission.

165
00:10:10,316 --> 00:10:12,135
The world is full with degenerate.

166
00:10:12,136 --> 00:10:15,627
The type of 10 o'clock is the worst. Each
week he/she brings to a different rosebud.

167
00:10:15,769 --> 00:10:19,707
I swear you that if he/she looks my breasts
another time, he/she will be sorry.

168
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:23,914
Damned it is, Carlos!
Notice for where you walk.

169
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:25,520
Put attention all!

170
00:10:25,521 --> 00:10:27,822
Two lobsters now
same. Wait for 9 o'clock.

171
00:10:27,823 --> 00:10:30,707
- I regret it a lot.
- That it doesn't happen again, do you want?

172
00:10:31,343 --> 00:10:33,858
They will stay without
lobster as soon as I leave.

173
00:10:33,859 --> 00:10:37,279
Kate, we don't run out of anything,
we are well. Moisturize you.

174
00:10:38,311 --> 00:10:39,670
You are already a real mom.

175
00:10:39,671 --> 00:10:42,252
I have to practice
all that can, not?

176
00:10:42,253 --> 00:10:45,135
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

177
00:10:47,978 --> 00:10:52,949
That somebody answers the telephone.
- He/she cooks.

178
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:55,832
If he/she is my sister, tell him/her that I said
at 9 o'clock. Not I can arrive before.

179
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,010
It is for you.

180
00:10:59,011 --> 00:11:00,366
He/she takes the message.

181
00:11:00,367 --> 00:11:02,203
Kate.

182
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:05,088
 ... I believe that you have to take it.

183
00:11:06,272 --> 00:11:08,720
- Say.
- The one one is well.

184
00:11:08,721 --> 00:11:11,603
She speaks.

185
00:11:48,604 --> 00:11:51,527
Srta. Armstrong? I Am Dr.
Burton. We talk on the phone.

186
00:11:52,324 --> 00:11:55,384
Zoe is well. He/she will recover.

187
00:11:56,941 --> 00:11:59,526
Did they already tell it to him?

188
00:11:59,527 --> 00:12:02,411
We think that it would be better than it
he/she made somebody of the family.

189
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,215
He/she knows how we can
to locate the father of Zoe?

190
00:12:05,215 --> 00:12:08,098
It has never been... 

191
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:10,218
I not even know their name.

192
00:12:10,219 --> 00:12:13,101
Dr. Burton to emergencies, please.

193
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:16,093
How much I sit down it.

194
00:12:16,952 --> 00:12:19,536
I have to leave, but I will return to give him/her
a glance later, of agreement?

195
00:12:19,537 --> 00:12:22,420
Yes.

196
00:12:43,426 --> 00:12:45,632
Hello, Zoe.

197
00:12:45,633 --> 00:12:48,517
Where mom is it?

198
00:12:50,896 --> 00:12:53,779
Did he/she die?

199
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:58,452
Yes, truth?

200
00:13:00,808 --> 00:13:03,691
Yes.

201
00:13:26,253 --> 00:13:29,291
He/she has a new message.

202
00:13:30,758 --> 00:13:33,231
- Hello, I am me.
- And me!

203
00:13:33,232 --> 00:13:35,134
We wanted to warn you
that we were made late.

204
00:13:35,135 --> 00:13:38,018
Be a terrible traffic!
But, we will already arrive, Good-bye!

205
00:13:38,811 --> 00:13:41,694
Not he/she has more messages.

206
00:13:48,602 --> 00:13:52,200
This is a beautiful Dolcetto 2002.

207
00:13:52,803 --> 00:13:54,915
Can they tell me from where he/she comes?

208
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:57,799
- Probably Piedmont.
- Of the south of Australia, Adelaide Hills.

209
00:13:57,896 --> 00:14:00,390
If they don't find a substitution soon,
I will have this baby behind the stove.

210
00:14:00,391 --> 00:14:03,822
I believe that it would be a violation
the health code.

211
00:14:05,058 --> 00:14:08,200
Bernadette. Look at the color
of this wine. It is beautiful.

212
00:14:08,436 --> 00:14:11,319
And it is clever for... 

213
00:14:17,319 --> 00:14:20,657
Tell me three words that
describe this he/she came. Three words.

214
00:14:20,843 --> 00:14:23,727
Did you know that he/she would come?

215
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:30,308
Kate, what do you make?
- To what do you refer?

216
00:14:30,309 --> 00:14:32,545
I thought that you would take
some free days.

217
00:14:32,546 --> 00:14:35,429
- No.
- Are you sure?

218
00:14:35,456 --> 00:14:38,339
Yes.

219
00:14:40,023 --> 00:14:42,771
I want a duck, two red meats
and some lamb ribs.

220
00:14:42,772 --> 00:14:44,924
I still wait the fillets.

221
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:46,189
Clever.

222
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:49,940
I want a quail and a
blanquillo for 9 o'clock. Let us go!

223
00:14:50,269 --> 00:14:52,336
Move!

224
00:14:52,337 --> 00:14:55,219
Terrine, carpaccio.

225
00:14:55,258 --> 00:14:56,405
Carlos, I need more saucepans, soon.

226
00:14:56,406 --> 00:14:59,212
- Five minutes for the lobster.
- We need it at once in 13 o'clock.

227
00:14:59,213 --> 00:15:02,095
Another beefsteak, quick.

228
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:05,118
Two duck breasts, two
lamb ribs. Let us go people!

229
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,082
Why there is not food in the one
counter? Let us go, be many tables!

230
00:15:17,356 --> 00:15:20,983
Dear Kate: The baby is beautiful.

231
00:15:21,581 --> 00:15:25,461
I called it Zoe that means "life."

232
00:15:26,699 --> 00:15:30,477
Now that it arrived, I realize the
enormity of what I am making.

233
00:15:30,728 --> 00:15:34,053
I want you to know that if it happens to me something... 

234
00:15:34,298 --> 00:15:38,100
 ... I want him to stay
with you, nobody more.

235
00:15:38,246 --> 00:15:41,128
I know that you will love my baby the same as me.

236
00:15:41,245 --> 00:15:45,175
Listen to me...  it should be the
melancholy of the three days.

237
00:15:45,831 --> 00:15:48,713
I love you, it mates. Christine.

238
00:16:02,859 --> 00:16:05,742
Kate.

239
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:08,695
 ... I want you to take a free week.

240
00:16:08,696 --> 00:16:11,775
Not it is a suggestion, it is an order.

241
00:16:21,973 --> 00:16:24,855
How's it going, doc?

242
00:16:29,478 --> 00:16:32,362
Hello, Zoe.

243
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:38,771
I prepared something rich.

244
00:16:38,772 --> 00:16:41,302
Not I am hungry.

245
00:16:41,303 --> 00:16:44,187
Good.

246
00:16:52,729 --> 00:16:55,721
You will be able to leave on Friday. Did you know it?

247
00:16:56,804 --> 00:16:59,687
Yes.

248
00:17:04,151 --> 00:17:07,075
Zoe, you and I have to speak
about what will happen.

249
00:17:08,285 --> 00:17:11,051
Can I return home?

250
00:17:11,052 --> 00:17:13,328
I fear myself that not.

251
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:16,212
Why not?

252
00:17:16,504 --> 00:17:19,387
You would be alone.

253
00:17:22,152 --> 00:17:24,611
Your mom asked me him to take care of you.

254
00:17:24,612 --> 00:17:27,508
So you will come to live
with me, of agreement?

255
00:18:01,185 --> 00:18:04,068
The kitchen is there.

256
00:18:04,715 --> 00:18:07,598
The room.

257
00:18:08,241 --> 00:18:11,124
This is my room and the bathroom.

258
00:18:12,516 --> 00:18:15,400
This will be your room.

259
00:18:53,853 --> 00:18:57,989
He/she calls himself Nelly. I have it since
he/she was 3 years old. He/she has an entire family.

260
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:01,974
You should see my other animals.

261
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:08,577
Zoe, is clever the dinner!

262
00:19:08,578 --> 00:19:11,461
Good!

263
00:19:15,117 --> 00:19:17,999
Bon appetit.

264
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,448
Is all well?

265
00:19:25,449 --> 00:19:28,362
What does he/she spend? Not you are hungry?

266
00:19:30,265 --> 00:19:33,147
Can I return to my room?

267
00:19:33,689 --> 00:19:36,572
Clear.

268
00:19:49,295 --> 00:19:52,210
Zoe, I have to happen for
the restaurant some minutes.

269
00:19:52,395 --> 00:19:54,955
Will you be well if I leave you alone a while?

270
00:19:54,956 --> 00:19:56,277
Yes.

271
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:58,975
If you need me, alone it presses
the one one that is my cellular one... 

272
00:19:58,976 --> 00:20:01,275
 ... or two that is the restaurant. well?

273
00:20:01,276 --> 00:20:04,786
It is to single two blocks, so if
you need I can come me at once.

274
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:06,733
Is it well?

275
00:20:06,734 --> 00:20:08,691
Yes.

276
00:20:08,692 --> 00:20:11,574
I don't take a long time.

277
00:20:45,454 --> 00:20:48,338
Hello.

278
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:58,458
He/she says: He/she "looks at the stars that
they tremble with love and it thrills!"

279
00:20:58,718 --> 00:21:01,172
Hello, chef.

280
00:21:01,173 --> 00:21:03,353
My God! You are you!

281
00:21:03,354 --> 00:21:06,943
I beg you you to give me the one
I secrete of your sauce of saffron.

282
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:10,117
Pardon?

283
00:21:10,118 --> 00:21:13,000
Listen this, boys. Listen.

284
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:19,297
"To paint the stars,
all the stars."

285
00:21:25,923 --> 00:21:28,360
You are my section of strings.

286
00:21:28,361 --> 00:21:31,243
"In the morning I will wake up"

287
00:21:34,624 --> 00:21:37,506
"This is our love"

288
00:21:38,638 --> 00:21:41,521
Now all: "With our love"

289
00:21:56,032 --> 00:21:58,915
It is well. Let us continue working!

290
00:22:01,392 --> 00:22:04,049
Who is it believed that it is?

291
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:06,038
Nicholas Palmer.

292
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:10,675
And allow me to say that the world would be
a somber and depressing place... 

293
00:22:10,901 --> 00:22:13,784
 ... without your quail in sauce of truffles.

294
00:22:15,348 --> 00:22:18,001
We have to speak.

295
00:22:18,002 --> 00:22:20,885
- You could have asked me.
- I sit down it. Not I could wait more.

296
00:22:20,969 --> 00:22:23,852
Nick was available.
I had to act quick.

297
00:22:23,892 --> 00:22:26,714
That that less I need now
it is a moonstruck one in my kitchen.

298
00:22:26,715 --> 00:22:28,900
Not it is a moonstruck one.
It is a little exuberant.

299
00:22:28,901 --> 00:22:30,684
God knows that we need
something of that here.

300
00:22:30,685 --> 00:22:33,569
Exuberant? Do you joke? The
type feels Pavarotti.

301
00:22:34,099 --> 00:22:36,211
Good night. Do you have reservation?

302
00:22:36,212 --> 00:22:38,589
- Yes, Matthews.
- Matthews. Yes.

303
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:41,473
Can I take their coats, please?

304
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:45,765
Allow me to take them to
their table. With permission.

305
00:22:46,896 --> 00:22:48,824
At once their waiter comes.

306
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:52,996
When I took the position I insisted in
that I would decide with who I work.

307
00:22:53,158 --> 00:22:56,041
Leah had been well
without me for a couple of days.

308
00:22:58,025 --> 00:23:00,907
- Leah can already be standing hardly.
- It had been well!

309
00:23:04,536 --> 00:23:08,108
Feeling pains while it cuts. Give him/her
the opportunity. He/she is an excellent cook.

310
00:23:08,291 --> 00:23:10,806
Not I know anything about him. No
I have idea of what there is... 

311
00:23:10,807 --> 00:23:13,312
Give me credit. It was the one
sous-chef in II Treviso.

312
00:23:13,313 --> 00:23:14,550
Italian?

313
00:23:14,551 --> 00:23:18,304
You bring to a sous-chef of a restaurant
Italian and am I who needs therapy?!

314
00:23:19,339 --> 00:23:22,213
We were lucky of getting it.
Peninsula offered him/her to be executive chef.

315
00:23:22,213 --> 00:23:23,584
Why didn't it accept it?

316
00:23:23,585 --> 00:23:26,467
Because he/she said that he/she wanted to work for you.

317
00:24:05,582 --> 00:24:08,465
Zoe.

318
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:18,338
The amusing thing of going in those taxis
when you are in Manhattan... 

319
00:24:18,518 --> 00:24:21,826
 ... it is that for some reason not you
you scare although they go very quick.

320
00:24:22,244 --> 00:24:26,800
You know that he/she goes managing quick and
unwisely. He/she is a professional.

321
00:24:28,744 --> 00:24:31,876
He/she has a license of
taxi driver, I am seeing it there.

322
00:24:32,197 --> 00:24:35,303
I not even know what is needed
to get taxi driver's license.

323
00:24:35,476 --> 00:24:38,358
I believe that alone you need a face.

324
00:24:39,312 --> 00:24:42,196
That seems to be the biggest requirement.

325
00:24:42,351 --> 00:24:45,544
Nobody that doesn't have face can
to manage a taxi in this city.

326
00:25:52,658 --> 00:25:55,540
Kate, awake.

327
00:25:58,007 --> 00:26:00,823
Kate.

328
00:26:00,824 --> 00:26:03,708
The school begins at nine o'clock.

329
00:26:03,859 --> 00:26:06,741
It is 8:20 o'clock.

330
00:26:12,288 --> 00:26:15,008
Oh, not.

331
00:26:15,009 --> 00:26:19,269
Skies! Well, we go to
to get dressed. Ah, you are already dressed.

332
00:26:19,435 --> 00:26:21,047
Well, give me one minute.

333
00:26:21,048 --> 00:26:24,200
Do you need useful? Feathers or paper?

334
00:26:24,441 --> 00:26:27,189
They usually have those things.

335
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:30,389
I prepared you the lunch yesterday.
I hope you like the duck.

336
00:26:32,898 --> 00:26:35,269
Well, let us go! Vámonos.

337
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,687
Non encounter my scarf.

338
00:26:36,688 --> 00:26:37,773
Don't worry.

339
00:26:37,774 --> 00:26:40,351
You can arrive your late
first day of classes. Vámonos.

340
00:26:40,352 --> 00:26:41,999
I need my scarf.

341
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,883
Zoe, uses a mine. Later
do we look for yours, yes?

342
00:26:47,952 --> 00:26:50,835
We will look for your scarf.

343
00:26:55,426 --> 00:26:58,309
Here it is.

344
00:27:00,153 --> 00:27:03,035
Is this?

345
00:27:07,403 --> 00:27:08,876
That!

346
00:27:08,876 --> 00:27:11,341
Fabulous.

347
00:27:11,342 --> 00:27:13,908
How simple.

348
00:27:13,909 --> 00:27:16,791
Vámonos!

349
00:27:20,665 --> 00:27:23,549
Ah! Your lunch.

350
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:26,932
Can you open up please?

351
00:27:31,978 --> 00:27:33,625
Why didn't you open up?

352
00:27:33,625 --> 00:27:36,154
Not I should open the door to strange.

353
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:39,037
Clear. Yes, that is very intelligent.

354
00:27:39,472 --> 00:27:40,532
Hello, Be.

355
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:42,850
Will you have some coffee? I ran out of it.

356
00:27:42,851 --> 00:27:45,733
Clear. We go a little
take, but...  one second.

357
00:27:46,726 --> 00:27:49,957
Good morning. I am they are. I live below.

358
00:27:51,303 --> 00:27:53,963
You should be the niece of Kate.

359
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:56,847
Zoe, not?

360
00:28:02,153 --> 00:28:05,035
My children are as of your age.

361
00:28:05,126 --> 00:28:08,081
They will stay with me the end
of week. Will you be here?

362
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:12,689
Here you have.

363
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:14,571
- Thank you.
- Of anything.

364
00:28:14,572 --> 00:28:16,975
- It is of the good one.
- Yes.

365
00:28:16,976 --> 00:28:19,858
Well, vámonos.

366
00:28:21,215 --> 00:28:23,505
Thank you for the noodles
last night Thai.

367
00:28:23,506 --> 00:28:26,388
- Not there is problem.
- You were very kind.

368
00:28:35,706 --> 00:28:37,912
I suppose that now
do you have to enter, not?

369
00:28:37,913 --> 00:28:39,562
Not I know.

370
00:28:39,563 --> 00:28:42,445
Clear. We go.

371
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,198
You will be very well.

372
00:28:50,199 --> 00:28:53,796
Srta. Armstrong? I am
Ellen Parker, the directress.

373
00:28:53,797 --> 00:28:54,575
Kate.

374
00:28:54,576 --> 00:28:56,806
- You should be Zoe. It is a pleasure.
- Hello.

375
00:28:56,807 --> 00:28:59,689
I will take you to your living room and
we will know your teacher.

376
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:07,120
He/she has to have somebody
more appropriate for this.

377
00:29:07,121 --> 00:29:10,721
Not I have idea of what to make with a girl,
especially one that lost their mother.

378
00:29:11,115 --> 00:29:14,030
How do their brains work?

379
00:29:14,191 --> 00:29:17,001
Non achievement that Zoe eats
anything of what I prepare.

380
00:29:17,002 --> 00:29:18,893
What should I make, to force it?

381
00:29:18,894 --> 00:29:21,083
Maybe strange their mother's kitchen.

382
00:29:21,084 --> 00:29:23,966
My sister never cooked.

383
00:29:24,027 --> 00:29:26,305
- It reheated.
- There the matter is.

384
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:31,434
Perhaps Zoe needs something more
family, less sophisticated.

385
00:29:31,665 --> 00:29:34,056
What did you eat when you were girl?

386
00:29:34,057 --> 00:29:35,963
Not it is the same thing.

387
00:29:35,964 --> 00:29:37,844
To what do you refer?

388
00:29:37,845 --> 00:29:39,954
My mother was a sensational cook.

389
00:29:39,955 --> 00:29:42,094
Undoubtedly I was the
only that appreciated it.

390
00:29:42,095 --> 00:29:45,723
And when your mother died, your
did father take charge of the kitchen?

391
00:29:48,125 --> 00:29:51,008
No. He didn't take charge of anything.

392
00:29:51,499 --> 00:29:54,265
We were lucky if him
we saw during the dinner.

393
00:29:54,266 --> 00:29:56,656
Then, who you
did he/she take charge of you two?

394
00:29:56,657 --> 00:29:59,532
Cannot we speak now of that?

395
00:29:59,533 --> 00:30:02,415
Well.

396
00:30:03,538 --> 00:30:06,420
How's it going fish sticks?
The children love they.

397
00:30:06,921 --> 00:30:08,503
Fish sticks?

398
00:30:08,504 --> 00:30:10,978
Yes, they come frozen and empanizados... 

399
00:30:10,979 --> 00:30:13,861
I know what you/they are the fish sticks.

400
00:30:13,917 --> 00:30:16,799
But I cannot believe that she is
paying for these suggestions.

401
00:30:18,342 --> 00:30:21,224
Fish sticks.

402
00:30:38,934 --> 00:30:40,866
Did you learn something interesting?

403
00:30:40,867 --> 00:30:43,751
No.

404
00:30:44,213 --> 00:30:46,748
Something not interesting?

405
00:30:46,749 --> 00:30:49,008
No.

406
00:30:49,009 --> 00:30:51,891
- How is your teacher?
- Bald patch.

407
00:30:52,152 --> 00:30:55,035
Good, that is interesting.

408
00:30:56,369 --> 00:30:59,251
Ta-give! Fish sticks.

409
00:31:00,206 --> 00:31:03,869
The other day I was thinking
in the little thing that I know on you.

410
00:31:04,677 --> 00:31:08,647
We are family and everything, but neither
though I know which your favorite color is.

411
00:31:08,861 --> 00:31:10,444
Red.

412
00:31:10,444 --> 00:31:12,778
Red? Do you see? Not he/she knew that.

413
00:31:12,779 --> 00:31:16,348
I love the red one. The
red it is a fabulous color.

414
00:31:17,701 --> 00:31:19,846
Which is your favorite number?

415
00:31:19,847 --> 00:31:22,729
Not you have to make this. do you know?

416
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:24,956
To make what?

417
00:31:24,957 --> 00:31:27,840
To make an effort so much.

418
00:31:34,123 --> 00:31:37,006
I already go!

419
00:31:37,358 --> 00:31:40,242
Hello, I am Charlotte.

420
00:31:41,453 --> 00:31:42,952
Of the agency?

421
00:31:42,953 --> 00:31:45,836
Does he/she wait another Charlotte?

422
00:31:49,155 --> 00:31:52,038
No.

423
00:31:54,184 --> 00:31:56,513
Then, can I enter or not?

424
00:31:56,514 --> 00:31:59,397
Clear! Ahead.

425
00:32:03,113 --> 00:32:05,997
Apologize a moment.

426
00:32:08,311 --> 00:32:11,367
I told you that I don't need one
nanny. I am no longer a bebita.

427
00:32:11,588 --> 00:32:14,471
What will I make? Not I can
to leave you here alone the whole time.

428
00:32:14,498 --> 00:32:16,143
Why not? I am perfectly well.

429
00:32:16,144 --> 00:32:19,026
Zoe, you put a barricade
in the door, do you remember?

430
00:32:19,406 --> 00:32:21,921
I get paid from the moment
in that arrive, does he/she know?

431
00:32:21,922 --> 00:32:23,786
Yes.

432
00:32:23,787 --> 00:32:26,367
I see that you brought something to read Zoe.

433
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:27,947
It is for my thesis.

434
00:32:27,948 --> 00:32:31,746
Mortal virus with mutations
quick. As the ébola and those things.

435
00:32:36,983 --> 00:32:39,866
Well that have a good time in the work.

436
00:32:42,505 --> 00:32:45,387
22 Bleecker, can I help him/her?

437
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:49,611
Table for five? Yes,
I can sit down them at nine o'clock.

438
00:32:49,868 --> 00:32:50,888
I know it.

439
00:32:50,889 --> 00:32:53,772
Yes.

440
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:58,012
How do you want to prepare the bass today?

441
00:32:58,448 --> 00:33:01,331
Tell them that we will serve them
to very important people.

442
00:33:04,953 --> 00:33:06,479
Don't you like the music?

443
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,256
It distracts the personnel.

444
00:33:08,257 --> 00:33:11,595
Nick, you were right. The sex
with Pavarotti it is better!

445
00:33:11,821 --> 00:33:16,004
What pleasure. With Bocelli also,
but alone for you tie of one night.

446
00:33:19,783 --> 00:33:22,665
Soon. Eat. Paunch. Now.

447
00:33:23,064 --> 00:33:25,947
Thank you.

448
00:33:26,637 --> 00:33:30,150
Me, more the baby, similar to
big portions extra, please.

449
00:33:34,395 --> 00:33:36,225
Bernadette... 

450
00:33:36,226 --> 00:33:37,605
Bernadette.

451
00:33:37,606 --> 00:33:39,882
That is.

452
00:33:39,883 --> 00:33:42,765
David. Victor. I believe that
they will be pure men.

453
00:33:43,201 --> 00:33:45,045
I can with them.

454
00:33:45,046 --> 00:33:46,300
Good luck.

455
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,773
John.

456
00:33:48,774 --> 00:33:50,209
Chef.

457
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:51,773
No, thank you.

458
00:33:51,774 --> 00:33:54,656
Delicious, chef.

459
00:33:57,237 --> 00:33:59,471
Alone a true cook can
to truly judge a plate.

460
00:33:59,472 --> 00:34:01,876
When one is hungry, everything knows well.

461
00:34:01,877 --> 00:34:04,760
Never like in the afternoon.

462
00:34:14,347 --> 00:34:18,968
My grandmother whispered me this recipe
to the hearing in their channel of death.

463
00:34:19,174 --> 00:34:22,950
He/she brought it from the old world and today
I prepared it especially for you.

464
00:34:38,734 --> 00:34:40,136
Contentment?

465
00:34:40,137 --> 00:34:43,019
Very happy.

466
00:34:45,093 --> 00:34:47,976
I believed that your grandmother lived in Miami.

467
00:34:48,077 --> 00:34:50,960
Good...  you already know... 

468
00:34:51,525 --> 00:34:54,619
We all think that he/she would die.
It was as a miracle.

469
00:35:02,401 --> 00:35:05,284
It was a miracle!

470
00:35:07,342 --> 00:35:09,669
You make you position of these
plates and I will take charge of these.

471
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:11,644
We won't intervene this way in
the one on the way to the other one, of agreement?

472
00:35:11,645 --> 00:35:13,730
Your half is more than mine.

473
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:15,846
Clear, clear.

474
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:17,540
I have more important things.

475
00:35:17,541 --> 00:35:21,037
Meat, fish, rabbit.

476
00:35:21,268 --> 00:35:24,152
It is hour gentlemen! We go.

477
00:35:27,868 --> 00:35:30,902
15, two terrines, a
blanquillo, two lambs.

478
00:35:31,197 --> 00:35:34,081
Seven, carpaccio.

479
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:38,434
- Did it season it well?
- Yes, chef.

480
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:45,794
It is well.

481
00:36:04,673 --> 00:36:07,649
Well, how do I go? Where is my lamb?

482
00:36:55,951 --> 00:36:57,570
Can I wonder something?

483
00:36:57,571 --> 00:37:00,197
Do I have another alternative?

484
00:37:00,198 --> 00:37:03,081
Where did you learn how to cook so well?

485
00:37:04,219 --> 00:37:05,769
With my mother.

486
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:07,120
Your mother, seriously?

487
00:37:07,121 --> 00:37:10,556
I thought that you had studied with
Alain Passard in L'Arpege or something like that.

488
00:37:11,616 --> 00:37:15,580
I made it. But my mother was
better and I didn't hurtle plates.

489
00:37:29,666 --> 00:37:32,549
Rays! I need more space.

490
00:37:41,072 --> 00:37:43,956
- Why is it so angry with me?
- Not I am angry with you.

491
00:37:44,166 --> 00:37:45,952
You are very angry.

492
00:37:45,953 --> 00:37:47,872
Look, this it is my kitchen.

493
00:37:47,873 --> 00:37:50,951
I have worked very hard for this
and I won't allow him to take off it.

494
00:37:53,342 --> 00:37:55,299
And why you think that
do I want it to you to remove?

495
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:58,182
How another thing could want?

496
00:38:00,812 --> 00:38:02,621
You treat me like to a dog, Larry.

497
00:38:02,622 --> 00:38:06,041
Not I am a dog. I am a being
human! A human being, maldi... 

498
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:09,956
I sit down it, it is that...  I have an audition.

499
00:38:09,957 --> 00:38:12,839
Would you care it?

500
00:38:25,933 --> 00:38:29,204
He/she looks, I don't need this work.
I can work where I want.

501
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:32,292
I like to work here because
it is a honor to cook with you... 

502
00:38:33,259 --> 00:38:36,141
 ... but I prefer to work in
a place where it is welcome.

503
00:38:36,316 --> 00:38:39,316
So, if you want that I leave, tell it to me.

504
00:38:41,993 --> 00:38:44,545
They can tell me what
is it happening here?

505
00:38:44,546 --> 00:38:47,429
Good... 

506
00:38:49,929 --> 00:38:51,749
A moment, to where do you go?

507
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:54,255
I sit down it. Paula, you have
that to look for another person.

508
00:38:54,256 --> 00:38:57,138
- Kate, what did you make?
- I didn't make anything.

509
00:38:57,993 --> 00:39:00,876
Nick, please. We need you.

510
00:39:00,995 --> 00:39:02,840
I have to hear it of her.

511
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:04,742
It is my restaurant.

512
00:39:04,743 --> 00:39:07,626
It will be your restaurant, Paula,
but this it is their kitchen.

513
00:39:07,682 --> 00:39:09,980
Without her... 

514
00:39:09,981 --> 00:39:14,112
 ... all this would be a heap of metals
hot and dirty plates, so... 

515
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:17,659
She decides.

516
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:20,543
Kate.

517
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:27,794
It seems that he/she doesn't leave me another option.

518
00:39:28,507 --> 00:39:30,184
Do you want me to stay?

519
00:39:30,185 --> 00:39:33,068
Not I have just said it?

520
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,840
I didn't hear those words.

521
00:39:35,841 --> 00:39:38,724
I want him to stay.

522
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:42,012
I would love it. I thought
that he/she would never request it to me.

523
00:39:43,851 --> 00:39:46,733
You are burning.

524
00:40:20,277 --> 00:40:24,180
I know that they are afraid, but
it is well, because I am here.

525
00:40:24,404 --> 00:40:28,487
But if he/she really scares a lot them,
wake up and I will take them by the hand.

526
00:40:28,785 --> 00:40:31,668
Especially you, Louie,
because you are the smallest.

527
00:40:31,672 --> 00:40:34,554
Zoe?

528
00:40:35,154 --> 00:40:37,915
Hello.

529
00:40:37,915 --> 00:40:40,181
When did Charlotte leave?

530
00:40:40,182 --> 00:40:43,065
Not I know. He/she makes a while.

531
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,082
It is very pleasant there below.

532
00:40:59,701 --> 00:41:02,585
I have an idea.

533
00:41:02,932 --> 00:41:07,229
What it would seem you to come with me
to the restoring morning in the night?

534
00:41:18,328 --> 00:41:23,585
Good night.

535
00:41:52,722 --> 00:41:55,604
Please.

536
00:42:04,992 --> 00:42:09,160
I have attempted everything. Not it cares
that makes, he/she doesn't want to eat.

537
00:42:09,489 --> 00:42:12,131
Why you don't try of
done to give him/her eat normal of boy?

538
00:42:12,132 --> 00:42:15,015
Have you been speaking with my psychologist?

539
00:42:18,883 --> 00:42:23,589
Well, two foie grass, a tartar,
two bisque and a goat cheese.

540
00:42:37,171 --> 00:42:40,054
Smell it.

541
00:42:40,605 --> 00:42:43,488
It is basílico.

542
00:42:57,535 --> 00:43:01,552
Kate, your biggest admirers
they die to see you.

543
00:43:09,959 --> 00:43:12,410
Leah, finishes the duck of the
5. I should take a rest.

544
00:43:12,411 --> 00:43:15,293
Yes, clear.

545
00:43:28,845 --> 00:43:31,895
I need a terrino, two bisque
and a prawn, please.

546
00:43:46,681 --> 00:43:49,564
The twelve you is
disturbing. Does it lack a lot?

547
00:43:51,267 --> 00:43:54,150
Subject this.

548
00:44:01,373 --> 00:44:04,255
A duck, a bass and
a souflé, please.

549
00:44:21,083 --> 00:44:23,965
He/she leaves a little for me.

550
00:44:24,850 --> 00:44:26,787
You know, in old Rome, the boys... 

551
00:44:26,788 --> 00:44:29,725
 ... they chewed basil bad for the
I encourage before the graduation dance.

552
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,443
It is true.

553
00:44:47,857 --> 00:44:50,740
Thank you.

554
00:44:54,614 --> 00:44:56,152
Not there were dances of
graduation in old Rome.

555
00:44:56,153 --> 00:44:59,035
Ah, not? Are you sure?

556
00:45:00,486 --> 00:45:03,369
I thought that yes.

557
00:45:11,215 --> 00:45:12,470
We see each other tomorrow.

558
00:45:12,471 --> 00:45:15,353
Thank You, Leah.

559
00:46:23,426 --> 00:46:26,308
To where do you go?

560
00:46:33,890 --> 00:46:36,772
- Hello, Bob.
- Hello, Kate! How are you?

561
00:46:36,915 --> 00:46:38,379
Well. What do you have?

562
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:41,343
I have fish blue cool air.
It arrived five minutes ago.

563
00:46:41,543 --> 00:46:43,276
Here I have mussels babies.

564
00:46:43,277 --> 00:46:44,928
What are there behind you?

565
00:46:44,929 --> 00:46:47,666
- Colorado.
- Allow me to see them.

566
00:46:47,667 --> 00:46:50,550
Incredibly fresh. He/she looks at this.

567
00:46:55,772 --> 00:46:58,466
Good morning, we are to 24 grades
and this very sunny one this noon... 

568
00:46:58,467 --> 00:47:01,350
 ... this Tuesday, February 28.

569
00:47:04,099 --> 00:47:06,982
Zoe.

570
00:47:07,147 --> 00:47:08,742
Awake!

571
00:47:08,743 --> 00:47:12,299
You will arrive late at the school.
Here your boots are. Let us go!

572
00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:19,733
Tell them that it was my blame. of agreement?

573
00:47:29,448 --> 00:47:32,832
Young ladies, today they had much
luck. I received a remittance.

574
00:47:33,055 --> 00:47:36,784
He/she comes from all parts.
Modena, Montferrato, Bologna.

575
00:47:37,027 --> 00:47:40,021
Smell it. It is black truffle of Parma.

576
00:47:40,202 --> 00:47:42,007
Not it is bad.

577
00:47:42,008 --> 00:47:43,449
Does he/she have white?

578
00:47:43,450 --> 00:47:47,971
My best product. Very, very difficult
of finding in this time of the year.

579
00:47:52,144 --> 00:47:53,293
Where did it get them?

580
00:47:53,294 --> 00:47:56,057
He/she knows that I never reveal their origin.

581
00:47:56,058 --> 00:47:58,665
- How much for the white ones?
-2.200 the pound.

582
00:47:58,666 --> 00:48:00,418
- Oh, my God!
- It is that they come from Alba.

583
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:03,302
No, no, not. I believe that
I broke the source.

584
00:48:03,352 --> 00:48:06,137
- What? You are joking.
- No, I am not joking.

585
00:48:06,137 --> 00:48:09,238
- My God! Are you well?
- Not I know.

586
00:48:09,404 --> 00:48:12,026
- Can he/she call to emergencies?
- No, no, not! The police not!

587
00:48:12,027 --> 00:48:14,909
Not to the police. We need one
ambulance. He/she will have a baby!

588
00:48:15,019 --> 00:48:18,074
My God! Stay relaxed.

589
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:21,203
We have a pregnant one
in Bleecker and Charles.

590
00:48:21,351 --> 00:48:24,015
The 22 of Bleecker.
He broke the source.

591
00:48:24,016 --> 00:48:27,752
-22 Bleecker, in the corner with Charles.
- Bernadette!

592
00:48:27,901 --> 00:48:28,834
Well, thank you.

593
00:48:28,835 --> 00:48:31,718
Respiera, this way.

594
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:37,000
Breathe.

595
00:48:51,777 --> 00:48:54,657
Oh, not!

596
00:49:01,074 --> 00:49:05,099
There to the left. You see those
do stagger? Give birth to here! Wait for me.

597
00:49:11,623 --> 00:49:14,285
Oh, Zoe!

598
00:49:14,286 --> 00:49:16,288
- How much I sit down it.
- You forgot my.

599
00:49:16,289 --> 00:49:18,939
- Not it is what you think.
- You forgot my.

600
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:21,633
Leah had its baby, I had
that to take it to the hospital.

601
00:49:21,634 --> 00:49:23,569
Same you forgot my.

602
00:49:23,570 --> 00:49:26,451
Well, I forgot you.

603
00:49:27,210 --> 00:49:30,090
And I sit down it a lot.

604
00:49:31,286 --> 00:49:34,167
They Come, Zoe. We go home.

605
00:49:36,201 --> 00:49:39,081
Zoe, we go, it is freezing.

606
00:49:39,573 --> 00:49:42,453
Zoe! Move!

607
00:50:18,308 --> 00:50:21,635
Zoe, I sit down it. I made a great error.

608
00:50:21,887 --> 00:50:24,767
I know that I am making all bad.

609
00:50:25,375 --> 00:50:28,255
But I am making what I can.

610
00:50:34,254 --> 00:50:37,134
Why you don't think in what
can I make to compensate you?

611
00:50:39,908 --> 00:50:42,371
As...  a desire?

612
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:44,283
Yes.

613
00:50:44,284 --> 00:50:48,024
Yes, you request a desire
and I will make it reality.

614
00:50:48,333 --> 00:50:51,214
And to change, you forgive me.

615
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:00,160
- Can I keep it it stops later?
- Clear.

616
00:51:04,751 --> 00:51:07,376
Kate... 

617
00:51:07,377 --> 00:51:10,257
 ... you are not making it bad all.

618
00:52:02,546 --> 00:52:05,426
They are expensive.

619
00:52:08,349 --> 00:52:10,732
All they know it in the kitchen.

620
00:52:10,733 --> 00:52:13,613
The carrots are another thing.

621
00:52:39,469 --> 00:52:42,349
Here they have. How many are they?

622
00:53:13,933 --> 00:53:16,547
- Kate?
- Yes?

623
00:53:16,548 --> 00:53:19,429
- Not you will work tomorrow, truth?
- No.

624
00:53:19,815 --> 00:53:22,696
And does Nick neither work tomorrow?

625
00:53:23,834 --> 00:53:25,847
On Sundays we close.

626
00:53:25,848 --> 00:53:28,729
Why?

627
00:53:36,692 --> 00:53:39,152
And that why?

628
00:53:39,153 --> 00:53:42,033
It is my desire.

629
00:53:45,703 --> 00:53:46,947
It was idea of Zoe, not mine.

630
00:53:46,948 --> 00:53:49,062
Why did I already know it?

631
00:53:49,062 --> 00:53:50,700
He/she says that he/she prefers Italian.

632
00:53:50,701 --> 00:53:53,427
- Your kitchen or mine?
- Not it would be simpler to make it here?

633
00:53:53,428 --> 00:53:56,099
- It is well, we will use mine.
- Mine is completely equipped.

634
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:58,980
Perfect. At twelve o'clock?
I will make the purchases.

635
00:54:12,934 --> 00:54:15,814
- Not you are cold?
- He/she was made late.

636
00:54:17,152 --> 00:54:20,032
Men!

637
00:54:24,779 --> 00:54:26,361
I open up.

638
00:54:26,361 --> 00:54:28,924
- Do say?
- He/she helps.

639
00:54:28,925 --> 00:54:31,805
There I go!

640
00:54:35,325 --> 00:54:37,537
- Hello you!
- Do you need a hand?

641
00:54:37,537 --> 00:54:39,592
No, I can.

642
00:54:39,593 --> 00:54:42,024
Here. I take that.

643
00:54:42,025 --> 00:54:43,346
Good afternoon, chef.

644
00:54:43,347 --> 00:54:45,819
Delights! Where is the kitchen?

645
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:48,700
There. That. that. yes.

646
00:54:53,251 --> 00:54:56,131
Well, sous-chef, put on your apron.

647
00:54:57,009 --> 00:54:58,964
Do you have an iron pan?

648
00:54:58,965 --> 00:55:01,493
Undoubtedly I have an iron pan.

649
00:55:01,494 --> 00:55:04,374
Well.

650
00:55:07,017 --> 00:55:09,897
No, no, not. Non touches my Tupperware.

651
00:55:11,044 --> 00:55:15,655
Tonight, Zoe and I will prepare
the dinner. Single Zoe and me. Zoe.

652
00:55:15,822 --> 00:55:18,703
- But I can help.
- It is my desire.

653
00:55:21,379 --> 00:55:24,259
Tonight we will make pizza!

654
00:55:25,662 --> 00:55:28,542
- The pizzas, for
favor, sous-chef. -Well.

655
00:55:28,829 --> 00:55:32,101
Now the flour, the eggs
and do let us prepare the mass, yes?

656
00:55:36,706 --> 00:55:39,198
Make it with the fingers. This way.

657
00:55:39,199 --> 00:55:42,570
 ... and you can create your
own person and to buy them.

658
00:55:42,773 --> 00:55:44,369
Well redondita.

659
00:55:44,370 --> 00:55:47,250
Then, when you are
it lists, make this and this.

660
00:55:47,336 --> 00:55:50,886
It is the first that they taught me.
Both hands. You should know how to make it.

661
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:02,616
Then you have to sing
in Italian. You will like it.

662
00:56:02,833 --> 00:56:05,473
Then the ribbons this way.

663
00:56:05,474 --> 00:56:08,354
He/she remembers that that you
I said. You can make it.

664
00:56:11,449 --> 00:56:14,329
Kate! We are clever.

665
00:56:15,861 --> 00:56:17,874
Without shoes.

666
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:20,755
Well.

667
00:56:21,797 --> 00:56:24,677
He/she closes the eyes. They come with me.

668
00:56:26,171 --> 00:56:27,600
Which is the secret?

669
00:56:27,601 --> 00:56:29,476
You will already see it.

670
00:56:29,477 --> 00:56:32,313
Not spy.

671
00:56:32,314 --> 00:56:35,194
We already almost arrive.

672
00:56:36,752 --> 00:56:39,147
He/she opens the eyes.

673
00:56:39,148 --> 00:56:42,028
Surprise!

674
00:56:42,395 --> 00:56:44,100
I suppose that we won't have dinner in the table.

675
00:56:44,101 --> 00:56:46,446
Not we have one. We are of safari.

676
00:56:46,447 --> 00:56:49,065
I already see.

677
00:56:49,066 --> 00:56:50,420
You forgot plates.

678
00:56:50,421 --> 00:56:52,190
Sit down. Not we need plates.

679
00:56:52,191 --> 00:56:53,480
- Without plates?
- Without plates.

680
00:56:53,481 --> 00:56:55,709
The dirty plates attract
to the big cats.

681
00:56:55,710 --> 00:56:58,590
Undoubtedly we don't want big cats.

682
00:56:59,561 --> 00:57:01,717
Allow me to guess who the pizza made.

683
00:57:01,718 --> 00:57:03,489
Me! Me, me.

684
00:57:03,490 --> 00:57:06,370
Seriously?

685
00:57:27,969 --> 00:57:30,849
You were so close!

686
00:57:39,345 --> 00:57:40,357
Anything didn't move.

687
00:57:40,358 --> 00:57:43,239
But if I dry off the eye, there is not problem.

688
00:57:57,266 --> 00:58:00,146
That is a vampire.

689
00:58:02,133 --> 00:58:05,014
The lion...  "The King León!"

690
00:58:13,826 --> 00:58:15,518
I should take it to the bed.

691
00:58:15,519 --> 00:58:17,136
Allow me.

692
00:58:17,137 --> 00:58:20,017
Thank you.

693
00:58:46,408 --> 00:58:49,108
When did you go to the kitchen school?

694
00:58:49,109 --> 00:58:52,061
When he/she was boy I sat down
in my grandmother's legs.

695
00:58:52,259 --> 00:58:54,671
Ah, yes, in Miami. Certain.

696
00:58:54,672 --> 00:58:58,179
In Pittsburg, in fact.
My father worked in steels.

697
00:58:58,477 --> 00:59:00,732
But did you go to the kitchen school?

698
00:59:00,733 --> 00:59:03,613
Are you joking? The
he/she cooks it is for small.

699
00:59:04,275 --> 00:59:07,155
After the secondary, me
I went with a backpack to Italy.

700
00:59:08,269 --> 00:59:11,542
I owe him/her my career to
a called girl Sophia.

701
00:59:12,536 --> 00:59:14,116
She was my first love.

702
00:59:14,117 --> 00:59:16,997
A bigger woman. 19.

703
00:59:17,583 --> 00:59:20,753
Their father had a small one
trattoria in Tuscan.

704
00:59:20,924 --> 00:59:22,853
He/she was a brilliant chef and
he/she taught me all that I know.

705
00:59:22,854 --> 00:59:25,998
Sophia told him/her that alone we were friends
and he gave me a work in the kitchen.

706
00:59:26,872 --> 00:59:29,285
I fell in love madly with the food.

707
00:59:29,286 --> 00:59:31,730
Of the Italian food.

708
00:59:31,731 --> 00:59:34,253
Of all the Italian one, in fact.

709
00:59:34,254 --> 00:59:36,066
What did it pass with Sophia?

710
00:59:36,067 --> 00:59:39,250
Their father found out
of everything and he/she said goodbye to me.

711
00:59:39,825 --> 00:59:41,975
What pity.

712
00:59:41,976 --> 00:59:43,700
They were opened a heap of doors.

713
00:59:43,701 --> 00:59:46,581
The two following years I passed working
in the best restaurants in Milan.

714
00:59:48,263 --> 00:59:51,144
And why to these heights
don't you have your own kitchen?

715
00:59:54,089 --> 00:59:56,800
I don't know it.

716
00:59:56,801 --> 00:59:59,681
I suppose that there am not me
arrived the ideal offer.

717
01:00:03,261 --> 01:00:06,141
What you would make you if you
did they grant your desire?

718
01:00:06,886 --> 01:00:09,767
I was already granted.

719
01:00:15,834 --> 01:00:18,212
I prepared it this morning.

720
01:00:18,213 --> 01:00:21,204
- I don't like desserts.
- Not you have proven my tiramisú.

721
01:00:30,395 --> 01:00:33,275
Perhaps yes I like the desserts.

722
01:00:43,542 --> 01:00:48,076
You know that in Italian, "tiramisú"
does it mean "food of gods?"

723
01:00:50,198 --> 01:00:52,982
No, it is not certain.

724
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:55,863
Because it would should.

725
01:00:58,932 --> 01:01:01,812
You have a little...  a
little of cream, here.

726
01:01:11,861 --> 01:01:14,741
I have to leave.

727
01:01:24,582 --> 01:01:27,462
You are supported in my scarf.

728
01:01:28,052 --> 01:01:30,276
Ah, is certain. Yes.

729
01:01:30,277 --> 01:01:33,157
Pardon.

730
01:01:47,171 --> 01:01:50,051
Good night.

731
01:01:53,532 --> 01:01:55,963
It is so...  impredecible.

732
01:01:55,964 --> 01:01:58,260
- In what sense?
- In all the senses.

733
01:01:58,261 --> 01:02:01,355
He/she never makes what should make
in the correct moment. It is... 

734
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:04,723
Kate. The life is impredecible.

735
01:02:04,785 --> 01:02:07,397
But not in my kitchen.

736
01:02:07,398 --> 01:02:10,278
I am sure that
you will be able to prevent the worst thing.

737
01:02:11,348 --> 01:02:12,860
The worst thing?

738
01:02:12,861 --> 01:02:15,741
That it ends up tolerating you for some time.

739
01:02:15,936 --> 01:02:19,690
What is this? A new form
of therapy? To insult the client?

740
01:02:19,967 --> 01:02:22,847
Alone the best psychologists use it.

741
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:29,600
I will see you after the school,
yes? That you have a pretty day.

742
01:02:29,799 --> 01:02:32,012
Hello, Kate.

743
01:02:32,013 --> 01:02:33,590
We arrive on time.

744
01:02:33,591 --> 01:02:35,133
Do you have one minute?

745
01:02:35,134 --> 01:02:38,014
Clear.

746
01:02:39,541 --> 01:02:41,611
I have been speaking
with the teacher of Zoe.

747
01:02:41,611 --> 01:02:44,344
Frequently he/she stays
slept in the class.

748
01:02:44,345 --> 01:02:47,225
And does he/she know which the explanation is?

749
01:02:47,862 --> 01:02:50,557
He/she says that he/she works until very late.

750
01:02:50,558 --> 01:02:53,327
He/she tells to their partners that
he/she works as kitchen assistant... 

751
01:02:53,328 --> 01:02:56,331
 ... in their restaurant for
to pay their room and their food.

752
01:02:57,065 --> 01:02:58,309
I already see.

753
01:02:58,310 --> 01:03:01,674
If I really believed that Zoe
he/she works at night in a restaurant... 

754
01:03:01,873 --> 01:03:04,754
 ... he/she would have to call to
Services of Infantile Protection.

755
01:03:04,849 --> 01:03:06,893
- Not it will be necessary.
- I know it.

756
01:03:06,894 --> 01:03:10,894
It is better for all when those
relatives take care well of the children.

757
01:03:11,196 --> 01:03:15,173
He/she would hate to see that the state was taken to
Zoe after all that has passed him/her.

758
01:03:15,482 --> 01:03:17,953
But I am sure that
you will fix this... 

759
01:03:17,954 --> 01:03:20,281
 ... and there won't be necessity
of arriving so far.

760
01:03:20,282 --> 01:03:23,381
I will be observing Zoe and
we speak soon again.

761
01:03:29,675 --> 01:03:32,369
Then the cellular telephone
of Sr. Daniels sounded... 

762
01:03:32,370 --> 01:03:36,378
 ... he answered and he/she was speaking
during the whole class. It was very amusing.

763
01:03:41,626 --> 01:03:44,506
Zoe, we have to speak.

764
01:03:47,170 --> 01:03:49,792
You can no longer come to work with me.

765
01:03:49,793 --> 01:03:52,213
Why not?

766
01:03:52,214 --> 01:03:55,094
Because I fear that not you
allow to stay with me.

767
01:03:56,278 --> 01:03:58,644
- But to my I like to go to the restaurant.
- I know it.

768
01:03:58,645 --> 01:04:03,354
I know that you like but it is not good that
a girl is awake until so late.

769
01:04:03,952 --> 01:04:05,796
You don't want to have me there.

770
01:04:05,797 --> 01:04:06,950
No, that is not true.

771
01:04:06,951 --> 01:04:10,463
No, it is alone that you need
to sleep well in the nights.

772
01:04:10,660 --> 01:04:13,413
Do you hear me?

773
01:04:13,414 --> 01:04:15,315
Not you want them to take you.

774
01:04:15,316 --> 01:04:17,032
What does it care?!

775
01:04:17,033 --> 01:04:19,913
Anyway you don't love me!

776
01:04:21,052 --> 01:04:23,932
Zoe.

777
01:04:25,828 --> 01:04:28,708
Zoe!

778
01:04:30,010 --> 01:04:32,890
Zoe!

779
01:04:40,229 --> 01:04:42,836
Zoe, coarse! Coarse!

780
01:04:42,837 --> 01:04:45,286
Leave me! Leave me!

781
01:04:45,287 --> 01:04:48,168
Come unfastened! I want
to my mom, not to you!

782
01:04:58,018 --> 01:05:00,898
Zoe?

783
01:05:02,137 --> 01:05:04,093
Can I enter?

784
01:05:04,094 --> 01:05:06,109
No.

785
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:08,820
Zoe, please. I sit down it.

786
01:05:08,821 --> 01:05:11,701
Veto.

787
01:05:41,489 --> 01:05:43,501
Hello, boys. Is their dad?

788
01:05:43,502 --> 01:05:46,155
Yes. Dad!

789
01:05:46,156 --> 01:05:47,997
- Hello.
- Hello, Be.

790
01:05:47,998 --> 01:05:49,485
- How are you?
- Well.

791
01:05:49,486 --> 01:05:51,288
- Can I request you a favor?
- Of course.

792
01:05:51,289 --> 01:05:55,117
I know that it is of last minute but
I should leave and Zoe and I fight.

793
01:05:55,337 --> 01:05:57,326
He/she wants to lower or you want
that it keeps on him/her an eye?

794
01:05:57,327 --> 01:05:58,921
Alone see to see it from time to time.

795
01:05:58,922 --> 01:06:01,689
Not there is problem. Play
inside, boys.

796
01:06:01,690 --> 01:06:04,571
- Do you have a key?
- Yes, here I have it.

797
01:06:05,561 --> 01:06:08,441
- Thank You, Be.
- And you how you are?

798
01:06:08,516 --> 01:06:11,635
- Everything is very new for my.
- I know what can help you.

799
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:16,491
He/she Calls to Anna. It is a blessing with those
children. it saved me after the divorce.

800
01:06:16,706 --> 01:06:19,586
I am sure that she will be able to take care
to Zoe every time that you need it.

801
01:06:19,958 --> 01:06:21,395
Thank you.

802
01:06:21,396 --> 01:06:24,192
Of anything.

803
01:06:24,193 --> 01:06:27,073
Boys, if they will play for
Ireland will have to be strained well.

804
01:06:27,194 --> 01:06:30,310
"Srta. Armstrong presents pieces
of truffles in an endivias salad... 

805
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:34,864
 ... accompanying a wonderful and silky
halibut lightly cooked to the vapor.

806
01:06:35,085 --> 01:06:38,384
All that emphasized with the glorious one
aria of their emulsion of saffron."

807
01:06:38,553 --> 01:06:40,570
Not he/she can decide if you are
cook or composer.

808
01:06:40,571 --> 01:06:43,456
"Their artistic and distinctive quail
with truffles he/she leaves very in clear... 

809
01:06:43,673 --> 01:06:46,581
 ... that now he/she has a great sous-chef
to supplement their singular style."

810
01:06:47,253 --> 01:06:49,281
Does that say?

811
01:06:49,282 --> 01:06:52,162
He/she wanted to know if you were
putting attention.

812
01:06:53,285 --> 01:06:55,195
It seems that you need a swig.

813
01:06:55,196 --> 01:06:58,076
I never drink in the work.

814
01:07:15,877 --> 01:07:18,587
Tell me how other things never make.

815
01:07:18,588 --> 01:07:19,846
To what do you refer?

816
01:07:19,847 --> 01:07:23,328
Good...  you never eat dessert.
You never drink in the work.

817
01:07:24,885 --> 01:07:28,548
I am wanting you to tell me that never
salts with types that you/they sing opera.

818
01:07:28,839 --> 01:07:31,719
I go out never with types that you/they sing opera.

819
01:07:56,931 --> 01:07:59,600
Well, I have one for you.

820
01:07:59,601 --> 01:08:03,991
Which the three secrets are
of the French cuisine?

821
01:08:04,212 --> 01:08:06,827
We go, everybody knows it.

822
01:08:06,828 --> 01:08:09,709
Ah, yes? Which are they, know-it-all?

823
01:08:10,032 --> 01:08:13,776
Butter, butter and butter.

824
01:08:14,020 --> 01:08:16,780
You are good!

825
01:08:16,781 --> 01:08:20,104
Not you had why this to make.
Not I am drunk neither anything of that.

826
01:08:21,260 --> 01:08:24,140
Ah, Be. Hello!

827
01:08:25,343 --> 01:08:27,884
Nick, he is they are, he/she lives below.

828
01:08:27,885 --> 01:08:30,450
He is Nick. We cook together.

829
01:08:30,451 --> 01:08:31,812
How's it going?

830
01:08:31,813 --> 01:08:33,757
Obviously he/she doesn't live in the building.

831
01:08:33,758 --> 01:08:35,363
How is Zoe?

832
01:08:35,364 --> 01:08:38,244
Very sleeping. He/she is a fabulous girl.

833
01:08:38,251 --> 01:08:41,131
- Good night.
- Thank You, Be.

834
01:08:41,942 --> 01:08:44,267
Yes, it is so sweet.

835
01:08:44,268 --> 01:08:47,075
He/she was only taking care Zoe.

836
01:08:47,076 --> 01:08:50,497
He/she is a very sweet, very kind man.
Not he/she could have a better neighbor.

837
01:08:51,057 --> 01:08:53,937
Yes, it is always so... 

838
01:08:55,773 --> 01:08:58,653
 ... good neighbor... 

839
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:06,440
He/she takes an aspirin.

840
01:09:07,144 --> 01:09:10,024
Yes.

841
01:09:42,671 --> 01:09:45,552
Let us go!

842
01:11:05,282 --> 01:11:08,162
It is hour of getting up, affection.

843
01:11:11,165 --> 01:11:14,045
Not I want to go to the school.

844
01:11:14,807 --> 01:11:17,652
Do you know what?

845
01:11:17,653 --> 01:11:20,534
I don't want go to work.

846
01:11:21,692 --> 01:11:24,572
Seriously?

847
01:11:25,023 --> 01:11:27,903
Today will be one day for us two.

848
01:11:40,623 --> 01:11:45,557
"To all in 22 Bleecker, allow me
to present to my small hors d'oeuvre."

849
01:11:45,925 --> 01:11:48,659
Allow me to see the picture. Emma
Jilliam. Here they have.

850
01:11:48,660 --> 01:11:51,110
"Three kilos and room"

851
01:11:51,111 --> 01:11:52,334
It is adorable

852
01:11:52,335 --> 01:11:55,546
"He/she desires to be able to know them to
all. Love and kisses, Leah"

853
01:11:57,156 --> 01:11:59,698
Kate is retarded.

854
01:11:59,699 --> 01:12:03,225
He/she requested me the free day.
A personal matter.

855
01:12:05,236 --> 01:12:07,759
One, two, three, four,
five, six! Well, Park Place!

856
01:12:07,759 --> 01:12:10,099
And with the hotel... 

857
01:12:10,100 --> 01:12:12,661
-  ...  1,500 dollars.
- Not I have enough.

858
01:12:12,662 --> 01:12:14,561
It mortgages, baby. It mortgages.

859
01:12:14,562 --> 01:12:17,443
Let us go! I adore this game!

860
01:12:18,784 --> 01:12:21,646
Let us go!

861
01:12:21,647 --> 01:12:25,495
Fantastic. Thank you! What do I need?

862
01:12:25,497 --> 01:12:28,433
A nine. Give me a nine for
to have parking lot free.

863
01:12:28,639 --> 01:12:31,519
Skies! Here we go.

864
01:12:33,944 --> 01:12:35,559
That!

865
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:37,443
No!

866
01:12:37,444 --> 01:12:39,299
Not it is exactly! No!

867
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:43,031
I am rich! I am rich! I am rich!

868
01:12:46,804 --> 01:12:48,765
Do you know what that means, not?

869
01:12:48,766 --> 01:12:51,646
- No, what does it mean?
- The war!

870
01:13:14,594 --> 01:13:17,474
I will fight with you! Him
do you fear to a pillow?

871
01:13:29,329 --> 01:13:32,210
How the rib eye goes,
boys? I need two basses.

872
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:35,462
Panceta, goat cheese, oysters,
beefsteak Tartar and rib eye to the grill.

873
01:13:35,694 --> 01:13:37,487
How much does it miss the rib eye, Mario?

874
01:13:37,488 --> 01:13:40,368
Let us go! Quicker!

875
01:13:43,011 --> 01:13:45,891
He/she needed the suflé he/she makes five
minutes. Let us go, boys!

876
01:13:54,944 --> 01:13:59,489
We had 110 covered this
night. Everything was excellent.

877
01:13:59,725 --> 01:14:02,127
You really have dominated the menu, Nick.

878
01:14:02,128 --> 01:14:06,029
You put your signature in the plates
and...  All the regular ones noticed it.

879
01:14:09,554 --> 01:14:12,812
What it would seem you
to stay permanently?

880
01:14:16,915 --> 01:14:19,245
I believe that I would like.

881
01:14:19,246 --> 01:14:22,127
If Kate doesn't care it.

882
01:14:47,026 --> 01:14:48,518
Who is?

883
01:14:48,519 --> 01:14:50,728
Do you have idea of what time it is?

884
01:14:50,729 --> 01:14:52,198
What?

885
01:14:52,199 --> 01:14:55,079
It is very, very late.

886
01:15:02,508 --> 01:15:06,081
Without you, the kitchen was a
place different tonight.

887
01:15:06,919 --> 01:15:09,799
I am sure that him
you made very well without me.

888
01:15:13,493 --> 01:15:15,094
It was a hell.

889
01:15:15,095 --> 01:15:17,975
That is better.

890
01:15:26,056 --> 01:15:28,586
Brandy... 

891
01:15:28,587 --> 01:15:31,047
 ... he/she came white... 

892
01:15:31,048 --> 01:15:33,928
 ... celery... 

893
01:15:34,054 --> 01:15:36,934
 ... but, chalotas... 

894
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:40,360
 ... and I age.

895
01:16:09,196 --> 01:16:12,076
I sit down the truffle.

896
01:16:21,477 --> 01:16:23,524
Not there am...  I think that... 

897
01:16:23,525 --> 01:16:26,405
Not think.

898
01:16:58,714 --> 01:17:01,594
Hour of the pancakes!

899
01:17:05,143 --> 01:17:08,023
Hour of the pancakes.

900
01:17:08,264 --> 01:17:10,933
Where is my sous-chef?

901
01:17:10,934 --> 01:17:12,507
Pancakes?

902
01:17:12,508 --> 01:17:14,853
Do you want to help me?

903
01:17:14,854 --> 01:17:17,353
Now turn it.

904
01:17:17,354 --> 01:17:22,001
Well. You can have your own one
restaurant. "Zoe" will call herself.

905
01:17:22,253 --> 01:17:24,226
I will call it "Nick and Zoe."

906
01:17:24,227 --> 01:17:26,776
Pardon? I squeezed the oranges.

907
01:17:26,777 --> 01:17:29,811
Good. "Nick and kate and Zoe."

908
01:17:30,139 --> 01:17:33,019
I like like it sounds that.

909
01:17:34,610 --> 01:17:36,875
Not in front of Zoe.

910
01:17:36,876 --> 01:17:39,928
Zoe, I will kiss your aunt.

911
01:17:40,469 --> 01:17:43,349
What shame.

912
01:17:48,816 --> 01:17:51,561
How will we work together now?

913
01:17:51,562 --> 01:17:53,018
We will make what we always make.

914
01:17:53,019 --> 01:17:57,117
You will tell me what to make and I will go to
your backs and I will make what I want.

915
01:18:22,519 --> 01:18:25,457
I want to show you something. Quick! Vámonos.

916
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:31,926
Excuse. Does he/she have leaves of file kaffir?

917
01:18:32,214 --> 01:18:35,294
- There. Yes he/she plays, he/she buys.
- I know it, I know it.

918
01:18:35,517 --> 01:18:38,397
- For what reason do you need them?
- You will already see.

919
01:18:40,074 --> 01:18:41,794
Here they are.

920
01:18:41,795 --> 01:18:45,056
- One for you.
- He/she smells well.

921
01:18:45,060 --> 01:18:45,980
Do you like it?

922
01:18:45,981 --> 01:18:47,483
One for you.

923
01:18:47,484 --> 01:18:50,262
Why do I know this scent?

924
01:18:50,263 --> 01:18:53,143
It is your sauce of saffron.

925
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:55,578
It seems that we no longer have secrets.

926
01:18:55,579 --> 01:18:57,200
He/she played... 

927
01:18:57,201 --> 01:18:59,093
I know it. I buy.

928
01:18:59,094 --> 01:19:00,341
Purchases.

929
01:19:00,342 --> 01:19:03,222
Two dollars.

930
01:19:46,074 --> 01:19:51,069
Today, he/she eats special plate,
we have duck of the valley of Hudson... 

931
01:19:52,129 --> 01:19:55,181
 ... on a pumpkin puree and... 

932
01:19:55,376 --> 01:19:59,770
 ... served with cupcakes
of zapallo and sanguine... 

933
01:19:59,953 --> 01:20:04,544
 ... decorated with a sauce
of wild mushrooms... 

934
01:20:05,090 --> 01:20:07,970
- Of the... 
-  ...  of the region of brandy in France.

935
01:20:08,061 --> 01:20:10,144
- What do you find?
- What is that?

936
01:20:10,145 --> 01:20:13,288
To Nick he/she was happened the idea of
to have mini desserts to take.

937
01:20:13,484 --> 01:20:15,480
 ... in a box.

938
01:20:15,481 --> 01:20:18,361
It is so obvious.

939
01:20:18,569 --> 01:20:20,429
So obvious.

940
01:20:20,430 --> 01:20:23,284
And Nick, I adore the wines that
you recommended for the new menu.

941
01:20:23,285 --> 01:20:26,165
You will have to speak of that with Kate.

942
01:20:27,875 --> 01:20:30,755
John, speaks to us of the one
plate of asparagus.

943
01:20:30,965 --> 01:20:34,983
We are also serving
a special accompaniment... 

944
01:20:35,182 --> 01:20:39,110
 ... and an accompaniment
of watermelon slices.

945
01:20:55,552 --> 01:20:59,185
Nick, the couple of the table
eight want to greet you.

946
01:20:59,441 --> 01:21:00,630
They are fascinated with the bass.

947
01:21:00,631 --> 01:21:02,096
Kate is responsible for all the food.

948
01:21:02,097 --> 01:21:03,986
She doesn't care it.
It hates to leave the kitchen.

949
01:21:03,987 --> 01:21:06,387
How interesting. How more
can you tell us of her?

950
01:21:06,388 --> 01:21:10,130
Do you know what? Not I will begin with
this. I don't care who leaves.

951
01:21:10,328 --> 01:21:14,487
But if you go, it tries of not
to stab anyone that complains.

952
01:21:15,796 --> 01:21:17,737
Don't look me.

953
01:21:17,738 --> 01:21:20,618
You. Me. There inside. Now.

954
01:21:30,153 --> 01:21:31,999
- Which is the history?
- To what do you refer?

955
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:36,511
I give your back a couple of days and it is
"Nick, the wine, the clients, the boxes"... 

956
01:21:36,664 --> 01:21:39,408
She offered me your position.

957
01:21:39,409 --> 01:21:42,289
What?

958
01:21:42,469 --> 01:21:44,910
Why didn't you tell it to me?

959
01:21:44,911 --> 01:21:47,614
- Not I can believe it!
- Not he/she wanted to get angry, he/she will tell it to you.

960
01:21:47,615 --> 01:21:49,691
He/she knew that it could not trust you.

961
01:21:49,692 --> 01:21:51,787
From the moment in that I met you,
I knew that it could not trust you.

962
01:21:51,788 --> 01:21:53,369
The truth is that you cannot trust
in anybody. You have never made it.

963
01:21:53,370 --> 01:21:56,250
Why he/she will make it
when this happens?

964
01:21:57,803 --> 01:22:00,683
Why you don't have the gills
of having your own kitchen?

965
01:22:00,842 --> 01:22:02,880
 ... instead of coming here
and to appropriate of mine?

966
01:22:02,881 --> 01:22:05,761
- Is that what you think?
- That is exactly what I think.

967
01:22:11,303 --> 01:22:14,184
You Know, Kate... 

968
01:22:15,766 --> 01:22:18,646
 ... allow well to enter
to somebody at some time.

969
01:22:19,233 --> 01:22:21,017
Perhaps one day of these you realize.

970
01:22:21,018 --> 01:22:23,898
You don't understand. This place is my life.

971
01:22:24,593 --> 01:22:26,054
This is what I am.

972
01:22:26,055 --> 01:22:28,894
No, it is not what you are.

973
01:22:28,895 --> 01:22:31,775
It is alone a small part.

974
01:22:41,055 --> 01:22:42,752
Anna, I am me.

975
01:22:42,753 --> 01:22:45,633
Hello.

976
01:22:48,685 --> 01:22:49,960
How was everything?

977
01:22:49,961 --> 01:22:52,910
I believe that we pass it
well. We Play Monopoly.

978
01:22:53,214 --> 01:22:54,634
Who did win?

979
01:22:54,634 --> 01:22:57,246
Her.

980
01:22:57,247 --> 01:22:59,305
Thank you. Anna.

981
01:22:59,306 --> 01:23:02,186
We see each other tomorrow.

982
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:19,688
He/she has a new message.

983
01:23:21,116 --> 01:23:24,477
Monday, 11:54 p. m.

984
01:23:25,201 --> 01:23:28,081
Ah, and so that you know it, I didn't accept it.

985
01:23:33,161 --> 01:23:36,042
Not more messages.

986
01:23:39,059 --> 01:23:43,600
Ah, and so that you know it, I didn't accept it.

987
01:23:48,522 --> 01:23:51,402
Kate.

988
01:23:51,777 --> 01:23:54,082
Are you still awake?

989
01:23:54,083 --> 01:23:56,963
Where is Nick?

990
01:23:57,168 --> 01:24:00,049
He/she left to their house after the work.

991
01:24:00,984 --> 01:24:03,864
Already fall asleep, it is late.

992
01:24:06,266 --> 01:24:09,146
Kate?

993
01:24:10,602 --> 01:24:13,482
You can sleep with Louise if you want.

994
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:19,640
Oh, affection, how sweet.

995
01:24:20,033 --> 01:24:22,811
He needs you, I am well.

996
01:24:22,812 --> 01:24:25,692
Good night.

997
01:24:29,620 --> 01:24:32,500
Good night.

998
01:24:36,697 --> 01:24:40,041
Not you were entitled to make that
he/she left. This is my restaurant.

999
01:24:40,260 --> 01:24:43,252
- That has made it to me to see clearly.
- It will be better than the quick remplaces.

1000
01:24:43,548 --> 01:24:45,810
Not you needed my help for the last.

1001
01:24:45,811 --> 01:24:48,691
- Kate.
- Well. I will look for somebody.

1002
01:24:51,391 --> 01:24:53,055
As a certificate or something like that?

1003
01:24:53,056 --> 01:24:55,209
Not I do have the papelito, does he/she understand me?

1004
01:24:55,210 --> 01:24:57,861
But there are types without
it licenses in the streets... 

1005
01:24:57,862 --> 01:24:59,874
 ... and if they can
to drive...  you know.

1006
01:24:59,875 --> 01:25:02,005
My specialty is in
the area of the meat.

1007
01:25:02,006 --> 01:25:05,836
I fight with meat the whole time.
Sausage, beefsteak, pig.

1008
01:25:05,981 --> 01:25:08,367
I am famous for my ribs
of hoggish Vietnamese... 

1009
01:25:08,368 --> 01:25:11,230
 ... with mashed potatoes and
saffron and asparagus with lemon.

1010
01:25:11,231 --> 01:25:14,769
I take myself well with people.
I am very good with people.

1011
01:25:14,948 --> 01:25:16,811
Ah, I am a...  I like people.

1012
01:25:16,812 --> 01:25:19,349
I always work in team
that all follow me to my.

1013
01:25:19,350 --> 01:25:23,063
I had a malentendido
with the main chef... 

1014
01:25:23,263 --> 01:25:25,965
 ... and the manager and the owners.

1015
01:25:25,966 --> 01:25:28,600
"Discharged" it is something
as: You are discharged!".

1016
01:25:28,601 --> 01:25:32,051
But I believe that it was one
friendly separation.

1017
01:25:39,321 --> 01:25:42,201
Why does Nick no longer come to visit one another?

1018
01:25:46,540 --> 01:25:49,533
We had...  kind of a fight.

1019
01:25:49,763 --> 01:25:51,264
On what?

1020
01:25:51,265 --> 01:25:54,145
Adults' foolishness.

1021
01:25:57,905 --> 01:26:00,785
Why don't you love me?

1022
01:26:02,370 --> 01:26:05,250
- Not it is that he/she doesn't want it to you to say.
- Will he/she never return?

1023
01:26:06,771 --> 01:26:09,651
No, affection.

1024
01:26:21,327 --> 01:26:24,207
Zoe.

1025
01:26:38,367 --> 01:26:41,247
For Zoe, with love, mommy.

1026
01:26:52,043 --> 01:26:54,847
Zoe, are you awake?

1027
01:26:54,848 --> 01:26:57,657
I already finished.

1028
01:26:57,657 --> 01:27:00,538
Are you having breakfast?

1029
01:27:04,296 --> 01:27:07,176
Zoe?

1030
01:27:08,341 --> 01:27:10,087
Nick, I am me.

1031
01:27:10,088 --> 01:27:12,149
Is Zoe with you?

1032
01:27:12,149 --> 01:27:14,700
When I woke up he/she had left.

1033
01:27:14,701 --> 01:27:17,581
I am here now. They have not seen it.

1034
01:27:18,025 --> 01:27:21,239
I don't know it. I told him/her of it ours
last night and it became sad, but... 

1035
01:27:22,227 --> 01:27:24,327
My God.

1036
01:27:24,328 --> 01:27:25,895
What does he/she say the police?

1037
01:27:25,896 --> 01:27:28,627
They will look for in the stations of trains
and of buses. It could be somewhere around.

1038
01:27:28,628 --> 01:27:32,630
He/she is a girl. He/she would choose
some place that knows, not?

1039
01:27:32,902 --> 01:27:35,782
He/she has gone to the school and
to the restaurant, it is everything.

1040
01:27:42,513 --> 01:27:45,393
Kate will be well. It will be well.

1041
01:27:46,632 --> 01:27:49,512
Go to see if
he/she didn't return to the house.

1042
01:27:49,670 --> 01:27:52,495
Zoe?

1043
01:27:52,496 --> 01:27:55,263
Perhaps he/she left a note in some side.

1044
01:27:55,264 --> 01:27:58,144
Not it is here.

1045
01:28:07,094 --> 01:28:10,969
Was their backpack taken?
If anything was not taken... 

1046
01:28:11,369 --> 01:28:13,986
- It was not taken to Louie.
- What?

1047
01:28:13,986 --> 01:28:17,142
She would not leave the
does he/she marry without Louie, truth?

1048
01:28:17,414 --> 01:28:20,619
I failed him/her, Nick. I sit down
that I complicated everything.

1049
01:28:20,832 --> 01:28:22,404
We will find it. I promise it to you.

1050
01:28:22,405 --> 01:28:25,285
She needs their mother.
He/she simply needs their mother.

1051
01:28:27,149 --> 01:28:30,029
I believe that I already know where it could be.

1052
01:28:34,464 --> 01:28:35,982
There it is!

1053
01:28:35,983 --> 01:28:38,863
Thanks to God.

1054
01:28:40,673 --> 01:28:43,553
Zoe, are you well?

1055
01:28:44,097 --> 01:28:46,269
Zoe, please, don't make this again.

1056
01:28:46,270 --> 01:28:49,150
I was so afraid that
it had happened you something.

1057
01:28:50,132 --> 01:28:53,012
My affection, what does it happen?

1058
01:28:54,338 --> 01:28:57,219
I am afraid of forgetting her.

1059
01:29:00,030 --> 01:29:02,851
We will never forget it.

1060
01:29:02,852 --> 01:29:05,732
I promise it to you.

1061
01:29:09,113 --> 01:29:11,993
Never.

1062
01:29:22,034 --> 01:29:24,914
Never. And we will be able to come here
every time that you want, you find it?

1063
01:29:52,288 --> 01:29:54,666
Will you enter, truth Nick?

1064
01:29:54,667 --> 01:29:56,879
Today not, affection.

1065
01:29:56,880 --> 01:29:59,760
- Do they still continue angry?
- No.

1066
01:29:59,852 --> 01:30:02,733
We go.

1067
01:30:06,856 --> 01:30:09,736
You see ascending.

1068
01:30:11,613 --> 01:30:14,493
- You know... 
- You Know, Kat... 

1069
01:30:15,156 --> 01:30:17,132
Alone he/she loved you
how much I sit down it, Nick.

1070
01:30:17,132 --> 01:30:19,109
Don't apologize. In fact
I have to thank you the.

1071
01:30:19,110 --> 01:30:21,183
I have thought a lot of what you told me... 

1072
01:30:21,184 --> 01:30:24,151
 ... about not having the gills
of following my dream and you are right.

1073
01:30:25,627 --> 01:30:28,393
It is for that reason... 

1074
01:30:28,394 --> 01:30:30,434
 ... that I accepted a work.

1075
01:30:30,435 --> 01:30:32,570
In San Francisco.

1076
01:30:32,571 --> 01:30:36,129
Executive chef of a new restaurant.

1077
01:30:40,744 --> 01:30:43,624
Go, that is fantastic.

1078
01:30:44,782 --> 01:30:47,662
Yes. Not it could have him fact without you.

1079
01:30:58,851 --> 01:31:01,731
Executive chef.

1080
01:31:17,758 --> 01:31:21,679
That of the table 7 say that if he/she wanted it
burnt he/she would not have requested it raw.

1081
01:31:23,096 --> 01:31:25,759
- That is raw.
- It seems that not enough.

1082
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:27,936
Rawwer and it would leave walking of here.

1083
01:31:27,937 --> 01:31:30,887
They are people of publicity.
They spend a lot of money here.

1084
01:31:31,089 --> 01:31:33,969
Not make fits
today. Alone he/she prepares another.

1085
01:31:36,463 --> 01:31:38,558
Well, it leaves a raw beefsteak.

1086
01:31:38,559 --> 01:31:40,186
It leaves a raw beefsteak.

1087
01:31:40,187 --> 01:31:42,201
Where is the lamb for six o'clock?

1088
01:31:42,202 --> 01:31:43,813
- How does the quail go?
- Well, chef.

1089
01:31:43,814 --> 01:31:45,437
Clever!

1090
01:31:45,438 --> 01:31:48,318
Terrine, carpaccio.

1091
01:31:49,635 --> 01:31:51,870
Of the idiot of seven o'clock another time.

1092
01:31:51,870 --> 01:31:54,751
He/she wants to know if at some time
you have seen a raw beefsteak.

1093
01:32:06,026 --> 01:32:07,473
Is the sufficiently raw thing?

1094
01:32:07,474 --> 01:32:08,588
Has madwoman become?

1095
01:32:08,589 --> 01:32:10,335
Yes. For that reason I go to therapy.

1096
01:32:10,336 --> 01:32:13,889
I sit down it. I will bring a new cloth.

1097
01:32:14,123 --> 01:32:17,003
No, please, he/she leaves
that I take me charge.

1098
01:32:17,749 --> 01:32:20,275
Not it was bad!

1099
01:32:20,276 --> 01:32:23,156
That made me feel very well.

1100
01:32:26,281 --> 01:32:29,161
He/she only wanted a beefsteak.

1101
01:32:32,167 --> 01:32:35,004
God willing there was a book
of recipes for the life.

1102
01:32:35,005 --> 01:32:37,885
You prescribe saying us
exactly what a to make.

1103
01:32:39,206 --> 01:32:43,394
I know it, I know it. He/she will say: "Of what another
does it form we can learn, Kate?"

1104
01:32:43,612 --> 01:32:46,492
No. Not he/she will say that.

1105
01:32:47,549 --> 01:32:48,732
Do you want guess again?

1106
01:32:48,732 --> 01:32:50,505
No, ahead.

1107
01:32:50,506 --> 01:32:54,318
What will say was: "You
you knew it better than anybody.

1108
01:32:55,038 --> 01:32:57,918
The best recipes are those
that yourself has created."

1109
01:33:26,540 --> 01:33:29,420
Subject this a moment.

1110
01:33:33,237 --> 01:33:36,117
I believe that you should know what
another thing has never made.

1111
01:33:36,943 --> 01:33:38,316
What thing?

1112
01:33:38,317 --> 01:33:41,563
I never enter to the apartment of
a man, I cover him/her the eyes... 

1113
01:33:41,753 --> 01:33:45,955
 ... I give him/her to prove sauce of
saffron and I beg him/her him not to leave.

1114
01:33:47,196 --> 01:33:49,575
- Never faces that?
- Never.

1115
01:33:49,576 --> 01:33:52,456
What pity.

1116
01:34:28,176 --> 01:34:29,974
Will you burn it first, not?

1117
01:34:29,975 --> 01:34:32,855
Yes, chef.

1118
01:34:35,398 --> 01:34:38,067
Not forget to reduce
the sauce a little, hey?

1119
01:34:38,068 --> 01:34:40,341
- You are spending of the line.
- No, it is not true.

1120
01:34:40,342 --> 01:34:43,222
Yes, it is true. He/she looks, your
tablespoon is in my territory.

1121
01:34:44,213 --> 01:34:47,569
What it accuses I have that your reduction
a slight little bit be. I should say something.

1122
01:34:47,746 --> 01:34:50,627
Not I want to speak, but
your sambayón has clots.

1123
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:54,641
You should be crazy.

1124
01:34:56,863 --> 01:34:59,743
- It is perfect.
- Allow me to judge to my.

1125
01:35:12,477 --> 01:35:15,358
You are right, it is perfect.

1126
01:35:16,993 --> 01:35:19,873
Pancakes.

1127
01:35:20,558 --> 01:35:23,438
Thank you.

1128
01:35:24,873 --> 01:35:27,753
Zoe, is already enough.

1129
01:35:30,686 --> 01:35:33,566
Hello.

1130
01:35:43,417 --> 01:35:46,297
To see...  what do we have here?
