Now, look.

Give me the paychecks

ever see me again.

the beginning.

" Helping others with
prevention and enforcement."

506
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,200
Project Hope will be
a joint effort

between the police
and community leaders.

508
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,440
It will be
a powerful new weapon

is you do not ask questions.

Why didn't you include me
in the beginning?

564

as it is yours, you know.

doing this together.

about friendship,

exactly where
you are now,

830
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:29,320
asking how good
security is.

00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,640
It's tight
as a drum, sir.

832
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,320
Who do you
think I am?

833
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,880
Are you sure this
isn't a test?

834
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,760
No, this is
not a test.

835
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:43,120
You're Mr. Durden.

836
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,640
You're the one
who gave me this.

837
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,920
Please return
your seat backs

838
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,520
to their full, upright
and locked position.

Yeah?

842
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:02,800
Marla, it's me.

843
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,040
Have we ever
done it?

844
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,000
Done what?

845
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,160
Have we ever
had sex?

846
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,280
What kind of stupid
question is that?

847
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,680
Is it stupid because
the answer's yes,

848
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,680
or because
the answer's no?

849
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,120
Is this a trick?

850
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,400
No, Marla,
I need to know--

851
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,600
You mean you want
to know if I think

852
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:17,040
we were just having sex
or making love?

853
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,160
We did make love.

854
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,360
Is that what
you're calling it?

855
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,640
Just answer
the question,

856
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,600
Marla, please!

857
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,600
Did we do it
or not?

858
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,160
You fuck me,
then snub me.

859
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,200
You love me,
you hate me.

860
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,640
You show me
a sensitive side,

861
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,120
then you turn into
a total asshole.

862
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,160
Is that a pretty
accurate description

863
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,560
of our relationship,

864

just say?

Tyler, what the fuck
is going on here?

00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,960
I asked you
for one thing,

878
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,680
one simple thing.

879

Yes, you do.

Why would anyone possibly
confuse you with me?

fuck with us.

They talk
to themselves.

They see themselves
as they'd like to be.

918
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,520
They don't have
the courage you have,

919
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,760
to just
run with it.

920
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,200
Naturally, you're still
wrestling with it,

921
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,680
so sometimes
you're still you.

again sometime.

your job,

or how much money
you have in the bank!

You have jobs, you
have a whole life.

934
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,360
You have night jobs
because you can't sleep.

935
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,200
Or you stay up
and make soap.

fucking Marla, Tyler.

Uh, technically,
you're fucking Marla.

938
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,000
But it's
all the same to her.

939
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:54,680
Oh, my God.

940
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:57,640
Now you see
our dilemma.

941
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,640
She knows too much.

942
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:01,760
I think we're going
to have to talk

943
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:04,880
about how this might
compromise our goals.

944

No, you're insane.

950
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,280
And we simply do not
have time for this crap.

951
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,560
It's called
a changeover.

952
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,080
The movie goes on,

953
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,560
and nobody
in the audience

00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,120

these made?

earlier
every night?

Have I been
sleeping later?

Have I been Tyler
longer and longer?

Is anybody here?

Déjà vu
all over again.

Yeah, with
enough soap,

971
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,040
we could blow up
just about anything.

972
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:25,000
Oh, my God.

984

OK, listen to me.

I think something
really terrible

is about to happen
at your building.

Don't worry
about us, sir.

21 60.

994
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:13,520
Marla!
Marla!

995
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,520
Hey--Fuck!--Wait!

996
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,160
Wait, I gotta
talk to you!

997
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:19,360
Marla, Marla!

998
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:20,480
Your whacked-out
bald freaks

999
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:21,960
hit me with
a fucking broom!

1000
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,600
They almost
broke my arm!

1001
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,240
They were burning their
fingertips with lye,

1002
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,280
the stink was
unbelievable.

1003
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:27,240
Look--Look,
listen,

1004
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,200
it's gonna take
a tremendous act

1005
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:29,160
of faith
on your part,

1006
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,160
but you've got
to hear me out.

1007
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:32,040
Oh, here comes
an avalanche of bullshit.

1008
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:33,520
A little more faith
than that.

1009
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:38,600
No, listen,
I don't want to hear

1010
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:39,560
anything
you have to say.

1011
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,600
You have every
right to be...

1012
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,640
Um, I'll just have
a coffee, thanks.

1013
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:46,520
Sir, anything you order
is free of charge, sir.

1014
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,560
Why is it
free of charge?

1015
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:49,680
Don't--Don't ask.

1016
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:50,760
Whatever.

1017
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:53,360
I'll have the clam chowder,
the fried chicken

1018
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,480
with the baked potato
with everything,

1019
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:55,960
and a chocolate
chiffon pie.

1020
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:58,040
Clean food, please.

1021
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:59,800
In that case, sir,
may I advise against

1022
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:01,040
the lady eating
the clam chowder?

1023
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:03,040
No clam chowder,
thank you.

1024
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:06,600
You've got
about 30 seconds.

1025
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:10,120
Marla, I know that
I've been acting

1026
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,360
very, very strange.

1027
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,480
OK, I know that
it's got to seem

1028
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:14,560
Like there's
2 sides to me--

1029
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:15,560
2 sides?

1030
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:16,880
You're Dr. Jekyll
and Mr. Jackass.

1031
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:17,800
I deserve that,
but--

1032
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:19,000
I've come
to realize something

1033
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:19,960
very, very
important.

1034
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:21,040
What?

1035
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:22,480
The full extent
of our relationship

1036
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,520
wasn't really clear
to me up until now,

1037
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:25,760
for reasons I'm not
going to go into,

1038
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:27,200
but the important
thing is, I know

1039
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:28,400
that I haven't been
treating you so nice.

1040
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:29,360
Yeah, whatever.

1041
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:30,360
No, no--
1 5 seconds.

1042
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:31,560
1 5 seconds,
please, please.

1043
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:33,400
1 5 seconds, don't
open your mouth.

1044
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:35,920
I'm trying to tell you
that I'm sorry.

1045
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,160
Because what
I've come to realize

1046
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,880
is that I really
like you, Marla.

1047
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,280
You do?

1048
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:43,800
I really do.

1049
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:44,800
I care about you

1050
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:45,840
and I don't want
anything bad

1051
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:48,360
to happen to you
because of me.

1052
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:51,040
Marla, your life
is in danger.

1053
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:53,000
What?

1054
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:55,400
You need to leave
town for a while.

1055
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:56,680
Get out of
any major city

1056
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:57,800
and just go camping
or something.

1057
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:58,920
You're an insane person.

1058
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,000
No, no,
I've involved you

1059
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:01,840
in something terrible
that's about to happen.

1060
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:03,240
No.
Shut up,

1061
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,440
shut up!

1062
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,160
Listen,
I tried, Tyler.

1063
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:10,360
I really tried.

1064
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:11,320
I know you did.

1065
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,280
There are things
about you I like.

1066
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:14,760
You're smart,
you're funny,

1067
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:17,120
you're spectacular
in bed.

1068
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:20,200
But you're
intolerable.

1069
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:23,080
You have very serious
emotional problems.

1070
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:24,840
Deep-seated problems
for which you should seek

1071
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,160
professional help.

1072
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,600
I know,
and I'm sorry.

1073
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:28,480
Yeah, you're sorry,
I'm sorry,

1074
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:29,640
everyone's sorry.
But...

1075
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:32,720
I can't
do this anymore.

1076
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,240
I can't.

1077
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:36,280
And I won't.

1078
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:38,760
I'm gone.

1079
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:41,320
You can't leave,
Marla,

1080
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:42,960
you're not safe!

1081
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:47,600
No!
Leave me alone!

1082
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,480
Marla, I'm trying
to protect you.

1083
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,000
I don't ever want
to see you again!

1084
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:52,680
That's fine, if
that's what it takes...

1085
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,000
You wait.
Wait right here.

1086
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:56,800
[Brakes Squealing]

1087
00:47:58,480 --> 00:47:59,400
Hold it
right there.

1088
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:00,360
- [Honking]
- Shut up!

1089
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:01,400
Shut up!

1090
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,240
Take this money
and get on this bus.

1091
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,200
And I promise you

1092
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:05,200
I will never
bother you again

1093
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:06,160
if that's
what you want.

1094
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:07,400
- [Honks]
- Shut up!

1095
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:08,760
Please get
on the bus.

1096
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:10,160
Please get
on the bus!

1097
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:13,000
Why are you
doing this?

1098
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,600
Because they think you're
some kind of a threat.

1099
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:15,720
I--I can't explain it
right now,

1100
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:16,680
just trust me.

1101
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:17,640
If I see
where you're going,

1102
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:18,600
you will
not be safe.

1103
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:19,800
I'm not paying
this back.

1104
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:21,280
I consider it
asshole tax.

1105
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:23,360
That's fine. Remember,
stay out of major cities

1106
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:24,480
for at least
a couple of days, OK?

1107
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:25,480
Tyler.

1108
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,280
You're
the worst thing

1109
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:29,680
that ever
happened to me.

1110
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:37,840
[Honking]

1111
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,480
Hello.

1112
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,080
I need you
to arrest me.

1113
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:49,320
I am the leader of
a terrorist organization

1114
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:51,600
responsible for numerous
acts of vandalism,

1115
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,320
and assault
all over this city.

1116
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:55,520
...in the
metropolitan area,

1117
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:58,000
with probably a couple
hundred members.

1118
00:48:58,080 --> 00:48:59,120
Chapters
have sprung up

1119
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,840
in 5 or 6 other
major cities already.

1120
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:04,840
This is a tightly
regimented organization,

1121
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:06,920
with many cells
capable of operating

1122
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,920
completely independent
of central leadership.

1123
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Look, look,
go to that house, OK?

1124
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:14,120
1 537 Paper Street.

1125
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:16,080
That's our headquarters.

1126
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,560
In the back,
buried in the garden,

1127
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:21,600
you'll find the body
of  Robert Paulson.

1128
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,520
In the basement,

1129
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:24,720
you're gonna find
some bathtubs

1130
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,280
that have been used
very recently

1131
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:30,200
to make large quantities
of nitroglycerin.

1132
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:31,280
I believe the plan

1133
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:33,040
is to blow up
the headquarters

1134
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:34,640
of these credit card
companies,

1135
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,520
and the T.R.W. building.

1136
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,360
Why these buildings?

1137
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:41,360
Why credit card
companies?

1138
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,200
If you erase
the debt record,

1139
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,640
then we all
go back to zero.

1140
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:47,680
It'll create
total chaos.

1141
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:51,280
Keep him talking.

1142
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:52,320
I need to make
a phone call.

1143
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,600
I really admire
what you're doing.

1144
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:07,080
What?

1145
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:09,280
You're a brave man
to order this.

1146
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:10,920
You're a genius,
sir.

1147
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,840
You said, if anyone
ever interferes

1148
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:15,560
with Project Mayhem--
even you--

1149
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:17,840
we gotta
get his balls.

1150
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:20,200
It's useless
to fight.
