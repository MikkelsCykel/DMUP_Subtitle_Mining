Hi, honey, this is your mother.

2
00:01:45,075 --> 00:01:47,395
Listen, I know you're very
busy with the new job,

3
00:01:47,396 --> 00:01:49,314
but please try and call us.

4
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,600
Did you get the birthday
sweater we sent?

5
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,120
We'll be home all weekend. Bye.

6
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,641
Howard, Jim here. We still set
for racquet ball on Saturday.

7
00:01:58,761 --> 00:02:00,521
Give me a shout,
Buddy, bye-bye.

8
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:06,001
Hi, it's Wendy. I had this really
intense dream last night, Howie.

9
00:02:06,161 --> 00:02:08,921
I was running my fingers through
your feathers, and all...

10
00:02:09,081 --> 00:02:12,881
of a sudden well, you better come
over tonight and I'll show you...

11
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:16,521
what really happened next.
Ciao for now, Howie.

12
00:02:21,002 --> 00:02:26,922
Hey, Ricky's back with you again for
lots more "Dance Frenzy" excitement.

13
00:02:27,042 --> 00:02:30,482
Here's couple number three,
our lovely Latin dance team...

14
00:02:30,642 --> 00:02:34,322
from Wedford Falls. Charles is a
Machinist First Class in the Navy...

15
00:02:34,482 --> 00:02:38,162
and his darling wife, Madge,
is a blackjack dealer.

16
00:02:43,203 --> 00:02:45,883
Just a super jock dance.
Charles and Madge.

17
00:02:46,043 --> 00:02:48,083
Come on, let's hear it for 'em, folks.

18
00:02:48,203 --> 00:02:50,083
What's the matter, George?

19
00:02:50,723 --> 00:02:53,963
Jock itch again?
I've got just the thing.

20
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:57,643
Here. Why not take
a shot of New Shorts Blaster?

21
00:02:57,763 --> 00:03:00,363
It's guaranteed to wipe out
feather fungus in even...

22
00:03:00,483 --> 00:03:03,004
- the most active crotches.
- Shorts Blaster.

23
00:03:03,164 --> 00:03:08,364
In addiction, you've won a new car.
But that's not all.

24
00:03:09,204 --> 00:03:11,764
Fred, I love you so much.

25
00:03:11,924 --> 00:03:14,684
- It hurts like hell.
- He's dead.

26
00:03:15,604 --> 00:03:18,204
$79,95? Forget it!

27
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:21,564
$49,99? No way.

28
00:03:21,724 --> 00:03:26,325
I'm Crazy Webby and
my prices are insane!

29
00:03:34,725 --> 00:03:37,845
Who did they
interview this month?

30
00:03:42,965 --> 00:03:46,285
Mm-Hmm my little airbrush beauty.

31
00:03:49,566 --> 00:03:50,626
What?

32
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:55,466
Oh no, it's a quake!

33
00:03:57,726 --> 00:03:59,666
Hey, I can't get up!

34
00:04:00,926 --> 00:04:02,446
What is going on here?

35
00:04:02,846 --> 00:04:05,446
Ahhhh!!

36
00:04:05,646 --> 00:04:08,366
Casey, did you hear something?

37
00:04:09,887 --> 00:04:15,447
I'm such a lucky girl.
I'm in love.

38
00:04:18,347 --> 00:04:19,347
Whoa!

39
00:04:24,547 --> 00:04:25,347
Hey!

40
00:04:25,547 --> 00:04:26,347
Wow!

Boy!

50
00:06:22,253 --> 00:06:24,773
I'm a dead duck.

51
00:06:24,973 --> 00:06:26,733
Hey, come on.

52
00:06:27,093 --> 00:06:28,453
No!

53
00:06:31,973 --> 00:06:36,973
Bender, go on in, Frankenweed.
We finally found you a date.

54
00:06:39,813 --> 00:06:41,493
What is this?

55
00:06:43,733 --> 00:06:46,334
That costume doesn't fool me.
No kids allowed.

56
00:06:46,454 --> 00:06:48,534
- Come on, Kid.
- Wait a minute, that's my date.

57
00:06:48,694 --> 00:06:50,134
I said out of the way!

58
00:06:58,254 --> 00:07:00,054
No, wait!

59
00:07:00,694 --> 00:07:01,934
You little creep!

60
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:04,894
Get away from my cart,
you filthy degenerated.

61
00:07:29,176 --> 00:07:31,296
- Christ, it touched me!
- What the hell is it?

62
00:07:32,056 --> 00:07:33,856
I wasn't trying anything!
Honest!

63
00:07:33,976 --> 00:07:35,816
Step on him!

64
00:07:53,457 --> 00:07:55,657
Up, up and away!

65
00:08:01,937 --> 00:08:04,017
Are you ready
for an incredible story?

66
00:08:04,137 --> 00:08:07,977
- Waste it, man, waste it!
- No!

67
00:08:29,138 --> 00:08:32,378
Talk about a rotten day?

68
00:08:51,419 --> 00:08:53,219
- Just saw your show.
- Great, thanks.

69
00:08:53,379 --> 00:08:55,379
- Beverly, we love your music.
- Goodbye now.

70
00:08:55,499 --> 00:08:57,460
Could I have your
autograph on my shirt?

71
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,500
Me too.
On my shorts?

72
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,660
Real charming.
Just go away, okay?

73
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,860
We're talking to you,
big Rock Star!

74
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,660
- Don't do anything!
- Don't go snot nose on us.

75
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:09,540
- We're your biggest fans.
- Let me go!

76
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:17,420
Help somebody, help!
Help!

77
00:09:18,741 --> 00:09:20,621
Come here, snot nose!

78
00:09:21,941 --> 00:09:25,741
That's it.
No more Mister Nice Duck!

79
00:09:30,461 --> 00:09:32,861
Let the female creature go.

80
00:09:34,101 --> 00:09:38,941
Every duck's got his limit, and you
scum have pushed me over the line.

81
00:09:39,581 --> 00:09:42,382
Jimmy,
do you like see what I see?

82
00:09:42,542 --> 00:09:45,502
- A talking duck?
- Yeah. That's it.

83
00:09:45,662 --> 00:09:49,782
I've been doing too much toot.
Shoo! Fly away!

84
00:09:49,902 --> 00:09:52,942
No one laughs at
a master of Quack-Foo!

85
00:09:57,062 --> 00:09:58,822
Jimmy, you okay?

86
00:10:07,343 --> 00:10:09,063
Get off me!

87
00:10:15,223 --> 00:10:16,983
You, creep, get out of here!

88
00:10:22,223 --> 00:10:24,063
You're breaking my fingers!

89
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:29,184
Now, you and "Baby Face"
are gonna beat it, right, Mr. Zitz?

90
00:10:29,304 --> 00:10:32,304
Before I get really mad!

91
00:10:33,264 --> 00:10:36,224
Come on!
Let's get out of here!

92
00:10:38,064 --> 00:10:42,544
This is obviously no place for
an intelligent, sensitive duck.

93
00:10:43,544 --> 00:10:46,984
This is unreal.
I mean, it can't be.

94
00:10:47,185 --> 00:10:52,745
- Thanks.
- You're not really a duck?

95
00:10:52,945 --> 00:10:57,745
You know, this is beginning to
seriously undermine my self-esteem.

96
00:10:57,945 --> 00:11:02,745
I'm sorry, I guess I should thank
you for chasing those guys off.

97
00:11:02,945 --> 00:11:05,825
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, sure. Terrific.

98
00:11:06,025 --> 00:11:10,506
I just have one giant question.
Where am I?

99
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:13,306
The lights up there
are Ninth Street and...

100
00:11:13,426 --> 00:11:14,946
the bus stops
at the corner of Powell.

101
00:11:15,106 --> 00:11:18,386
No, no, no, no.
I'm asking, what is this place?

102
00:11:18,866 --> 00:11:21,666
- Cleveland?
- Cleveland?

103
00:11:21,906 --> 00:11:25,146
That's a perfect weird name
for this planet.

104
00:11:25,266 --> 00:11:27,466
Planet?
No, no, that's a city.

105
00:11:27,626 --> 00:11:30,786
The planet's
You don't know the planet?

106
00:11:33,267 --> 00:11:36,267
The planet's called Earth,
I think.

107
00:11:36,387 --> 00:11:38,907
And I'm obviously in some
sort of terrible nightmare.

108
00:11:39,067 --> 00:11:41,787
Yeah?
Your nightmare or mine?

109
00:11:41,947 --> 00:11:43,667
Good point.

110
00:11:44,587 --> 00:11:48,667
So, I guess
I better be going.

111
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:53,387
Thanks again.

112
00:11:55,508 --> 00:11:57,228
Bye.

113
00:12:00,068 --> 00:12:01,988
Bye.

114
00:12:30,949 --> 00:12:34,229
Listen?
You got someplace to go?

115
00:12:34,389 --> 00:12:39,950
If I had someplace to go,
I certainly wouldn't be in Cleveland.

116
00:13:00,991 --> 00:13:02,631
Come on.

117
00:13:08,311 --> 00:13:10,471
Nice place.
Do you pay to live here?

118
00:13:10,591 --> 00:13:13,231
It's cheap. The manager
of my band found it for me.

119
00:13:13,911 --> 00:13:15,791
I suggest you find
a new manager.

120
00:13:15,911 --> 00:13:18,911
I'd love to, but we got this damn
contract with this sleazoid.

121
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:21,551
He won't even give us
the money he owes us.

122
00:13:24,432 --> 00:13:26,392
Come on in.

123
00:13:28,832 --> 00:13:30,712
It's sort of a disaster area.

124
00:13:31,312 --> 00:13:33,232
We've been working on
some new songs, you know.

125
00:13:33,432 --> 00:13:36,952
See, the band's called
Cherry Bomb and, well...

126
00:13:37,112 --> 00:13:40,872
we've been playing these grungy
mong-holes waiting for our big break.

127
00:13:43,192 --> 00:13:46,113
You don't have any idea what
I'm talking about, do you Mister...

128
00:13:46,273 --> 00:13:49,193
- Hello.
- Duck?

129
00:13:49,473 --> 00:13:52,913
- It's Howard, thank you.
- Right, Howard.

130
00:13:53,113 --> 00:13:54,833
Hi, I'm Beverly.

131
00:13:55,913 --> 00:13:59,753
Listen, would you like
something to eat or drink?

132
00:14:00,953 --> 00:14:04,033
Milk?
I could put it in a bowl.

133
00:14:04,993 --> 00:14:08,434
Doll, I don't drink out of bowls.
You got a beer?

134
00:14:08,674 --> 00:14:13,994
Beer?
Right, beer, right.

135
00:14:16,234 --> 00:14:18,274
God, I can't believe this.

136
00:14:19,434 --> 00:14:21,714
- I'll put you in a bowl.
- What?

137
00:14:22,554 --> 00:14:24,474
Give me a break.

138
00:14:27,114 --> 00:14:28,915
- What's this?
- It's a purse.

139
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:31,435
- I got it at a swap meet.
- Cute.

140
00:14:33,475 --> 00:14:37,155
I'm sorry I'm so nervous. It's just
that I've never been around a...

141
00:14:38,315 --> 00:14:40,795
I mean, I've never even had
any pets or anything, you know?

142
00:14:40,955 --> 00:14:42,915
They seem like such a hassle.
You know, feeding them...

143
00:14:43,035 --> 00:14:46,755
- cleaning up their little poo-poos.
- I'll try to be careful.

144
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:48,995
No, I didn't mean that you...

145
00:14:50,475 --> 00:14:52,316
Look, why don't
you just sit down...

146
00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:56,636
- Okay, why not?
- And make yourself at home.

147
00:14:56,796 --> 00:15:00,676
- Make myself at home? I wish.
- Listen.

148
00:15:01,956 --> 00:15:03,476
No, not again!

149
00:15:07,956 --> 00:15:11,956
Howard, it's okay.
Are you all right?

150
00:15:12,156 --> 00:15:16,597
- The chair started shaking.
- It was just a big truck going by.

151
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:20,517
A truck?
I knew that.

152
00:15:21,757 --> 00:15:25,717
What I don't know is
what the hell I'm doing here!

153
00:15:26,557 --> 00:15:31,397
It's like a bad trip. I mean,
talk about an identity crisis.

154
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,877
Yeah, what an awful
thing to happen.

155
00:15:34,077 --> 00:15:36,398
Howard, I was
just kinda wondering...

156
00:15:36,558 --> 00:15:39,798
does everybody
in your planet look like you?

157
00:15:39,918 --> 00:15:43,438
- Obviously, why?
- No reason, just wondered.

158
00:15:43,838 --> 00:15:46,838
So, what do you do back home?
You got a job? You go to school?

159
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:50,198
- I went to med school for a while.
- You went to med school?

160
00:15:50,358 --> 00:15:52,798
Yeah, my parents
wanted me to be a doctor.

161
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:57,439
Plastic surgeon, making big bucks,
doing big jobs, tail tucks.

162
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:01,039
- What happened?
- I dropped out.

163
00:16:01,599 --> 00:16:05,119
And I decided to educate myself
in the real world, on the streets.

164
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,479
So, I wrote songs at night
and did construction work by day.

165
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,479
That sounds great.
You know, I write songs too.

166
00:16:11,599 --> 00:16:14,239
- What kind of...
- Listen, it doesn't matter.

167
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,839
It was all a pipe dream.
I got so tired of everyone saying...

168
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:22,600
"Grow up, Howard".
I guess I finally did.

169
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,480
Last month I got what
they call a "promising job".

170
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,200
- Yeah? Doing what?
- Advertising copywriter.

171
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:36,800
Only two things touch my feathers,
this "Oil of Night Fowl" and him.

172
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,720
I wrote that.

173
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:44,721
Howard, it sort of sounds
like you sold out.

174
00:16:44,841 --> 00:16:48,441
Maybe. But sometimes
I still get this feeling...

175
00:16:48,601 --> 00:16:51,841
there's some kind of
special destiny waiting for me.

176
00:16:52,161 --> 00:16:54,521
Howard, that's it.
Maybe that's why you're here.

177
00:16:54,641 --> 00:16:55,801
- What?
- I mean, I believe that...

178
00:16:55,921 --> 00:16:57,561
there are no accidents
in the Universe.

179
00:16:57,681 --> 00:16:59,081
Maybe you're here
for some greater purpose.

180
00:16:59,281 --> 00:17:02,841
- Some cosmic cause.
- Are you nuts?

181
00:17:04,362 --> 00:17:07,242
I got no intention
of being stranded here.

182
00:17:07,362 --> 00:17:11,402
I gotta get back.
How, is another matter.

183
00:17:11,562 --> 00:17:15,522
Yeah, right.
We got get some help.

184
00:17:16,562 --> 00:17:18,802
But, Howard...

185
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:20,045
Geez.

186
00:18:32,926 --> 00:18:35,406
Howard?

187
00:18:53,686 --> 00:18:57,847
What am I gonna
do with you, Ducky?

188
00:19:24,248 --> 00:19:26,488
- This is humiliating.
- I just don't want people...

189
00:19:26,648 --> 00:19:29,528
- freaking out all over the place.
- What about me?

190
00:19:29,688 --> 00:19:31,368
I'm gonna have to see
a psychiatrist every day...

191
00:19:31,488 --> 00:19:33,848
- for the rest of my life.
- Relax, we're almost there.

192
00:19:33,968 --> 00:19:36,648
- Goody.
- Phil's a scientist. He can help.

193
00:19:39,969 --> 00:19:41,849
- Howard, this isn't working.
- Tell me about it.

194
00:19:41,969 --> 00:19:42,969
Can I give you
a hand with that.

195
00:19:43,129 --> 00:19:45,249
- No, we're doing...
- What's in the bag?

196
00:19:45,409 --> 00:19:47,089
I'm doing just fine,
thank you very much.

197
00:19:47,289 --> 00:19:48,929
Let me out of here.

198
00:19:49,569 --> 00:19:50,929
- Excuse me. Can I help with that?
- No!

199
00:19:51,049 --> 00:19:52,289
Yes!

200
00:19:53,329 --> 00:19:55,049
Why are we stopping?

201
00:19:55,929 --> 00:19:57,249
- Hi.
- Hi, Beverly.

202
00:19:57,409 --> 00:20:00,610
We had an appointment.
We got here as fast as we could.

203
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:15,090
Listen, everybody, this is it!
I've just seen it!

204
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:17,930
It's in there!
It's a...

205
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:24,771
It's nothing!
It's nothing, never mind.

206
00:20:25,251 --> 00:20:26,891
Carry on, Dr. Chapin.

207
00:20:36,171 --> 00:20:40,851
This is amazing.
Man's oldest fantasy.

208
00:20:41,251 --> 00:20:47,932
Across a sea of stars!
Look up in the sky!

209
00:20:48,132 --> 00:20:51,132
It's a bird!
It's a plane!

210
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:56,372
- No, it's a duck!
- Phil, you gotta help us!

211
00:20:56,532 --> 00:21:00,092
- What are we gonna do?
- Nice, Ducky.

212
00:21:00,732 --> 00:21:06,933
Me, Phil, you Howard.
We be friends.

213
00:21:09,533 --> 00:21:13,853
Me Phil, you Howard.
We be friends.

214
00:21:14,013 --> 00:21:16,893
Undoubtedly on of Earth's
greatest minds here.

215
00:21:18,013 --> 00:21:20,733
Phil, don't talk to him like that.
He's just as smart as you are.

216
00:21:20,893 --> 00:21:24,173
- Now I'm really depressed.
- Highly intelligent, perhaps even...

217
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:26,653
Wait, that's it.
We're about to see...

218
00:21:26,813 --> 00:21:29,374
if subject has any abilities
we don't have on Earth, any...

219
00:21:29,534 --> 00:21:34,294
- What?
- Shall we say, super powers?

220
00:21:35,094 --> 00:21:39,534
Howard, can you bend this?

221
00:21:40,614 --> 00:21:42,974
- What are you, crazy?
- Howard...

222
00:21:43,774 --> 00:21:49,174
can you burn a hole through
this with some kind of eye laser?

223
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:52,535
Can I bite your nose off
with my super bill?

224
00:21:52,655 --> 00:21:55,495
Howard, quit holding out.
I want you to concentrate...

225
00:21:55,615 --> 00:22:00,255
- and read my mind.
- Right. You're thinking...

226
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:04,295
"They know I'm a phony.
They know I'm a yo-yo."

227
00:22:04,695 --> 00:22:06,855
Tell me if I'm warm
on any of these, Phil.

228
00:22:07,015 --> 00:22:10,455
I want you to look into the future
and tell me what you see.

229
00:22:10,575 --> 00:22:14,136
- I see myself walking out that door!
- Yeah, me too.

230
00:22:14,896 --> 00:22:17,896
- No, no, no, wait! You can't leave.
- Yeah, why not?

231
00:22:18,016 --> 00:22:20,416
Because there are papers
to be written, there's research...

232
00:22:20,536 --> 00:22:23,576
to be done and there's symposiums
to give, lecture tours.

233
00:22:23,696 --> 00:22:25,936
Howard, we are on our way
to the Science Hall of Fame.

234
00:22:26,056 --> 00:22:29,856
Look out Darwin! Look out Einstein!
Hello, Nobel Prize!

235
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:31,976
We are not here to
make you famous, Blumburtt.

236
00:22:32,096 --> 00:22:33,576
Beverly, listen, I never
bad-mouthed others...

237
00:22:33,696 --> 00:22:36,137
in the scientific fraternity but
you bring in an alien in a bag...

238
00:22:36,257 --> 00:22:37,777
to most guys and
whamo they are talking.

239
00:22:37,897 --> 00:22:41,177
Let's cut him into little pieces and
see what color his organs are.

240
00:22:41,297 --> 00:22:43,257
I just wanna know,
"A", what I'm doing here...

241
00:22:43,417 --> 00:22:45,217
and "B",
how I'm gonna get back?

242
00:22:45,377 --> 00:22:47,417
Piece of cake.
"A" I'm just the guy to help...

243
00:22:47,617 --> 00:22:50,817
and that's because "B",
I've already got a theory.

244
00:22:50,897 --> 00:22:53,417
- What theory?
- Well, this is, of course...

245
00:22:53,537 --> 00:22:56,857
the evolutionary ladder
showing how man progressed...

246
00:22:57,017 --> 00:23:01,818
- from monkey, to me, for instance.
- You consider that progress?

247
00:23:02,498 --> 00:23:06,338
You're all hairless apes?
That's really disgusting.

248
00:23:06,498 --> 00:23:10,298
Now, I want you both to imagine
somewhere in the Universe...

249
00:23:10,498 --> 00:23:14,498
is Howard's world,
picture it in your mind.

250
00:23:14,658 --> 00:23:16,658
A world almost
exactly like ours...

251
00:23:16,818 --> 00:23:20,259
except that the progenitor
of the dominant species...

252
00:23:20,419 --> 00:23:25,819
- was not a monkey but a duck!
- Some theory.

253
00:23:25,979 --> 00:23:27,899
Every school duck
knows this stuff!

254
00:23:28,059 --> 00:23:32,099
And as duck climbed up
the evolutionary ladder...

255
00:23:32,299 --> 00:23:36,379
he said "Adios" to his wings.
His mental capacity increases.

256
00:23:36,539 --> 00:23:39,459
He begins to develop.
Beverly?

257
00:23:39,779 --> 00:23:43,060
- Shopping Malls?
- No, tribes.

258
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:49,100
Cro-Magnon Duck, who
ultimately evolves into Howard.

259
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,060
Blumburtt?
Blumburtt?

260
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,860
- Come on!
- What the hell are you doing?

261
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:55,300
- What?
- Don't move! Don't breathe!

262
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,620
Did you finish cleaning
up the specimen lab?

263
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,820
- Almost finished.
- Well, get down to...

264
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,500
the Marine Lift Exhibit
with a mop.

265
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,740
Some kid upchucked
all over the fern fossils.

266
00:24:04,101 --> 00:24:06,021
Right.
Good as done, Dr. Chapin.

267
00:24:06,821 --> 00:24:11,061
So, Philsey, you are
a scientist or a janitor?

268
00:24:11,341 --> 00:24:14,421
- I'm a lab assistant.
- That's terrific! Just perfect.

269
00:24:14,541 --> 00:24:16,061
- Yep, I'm out of here.
- Look, it's just a temporary job...

270
00:24:16,181 --> 00:24:17,901
until I finish school and
get my own museum.

271
00:24:18,021 --> 00:24:19,901
Yeah, stuffed you'd
make a great exhibit.

272
00:24:20,021 --> 00:24:22,021
Howard!
Howard, wait!

273
00:24:24,741 --> 00:24:26,662
- Typical hairless ape.
- Howard, look, come on...

274
00:24:26,782 --> 00:24:28,862
don't flutter off in a huff!
Beverly, listen, I've got...

275
00:24:29,022 --> 00:24:31,622
some important matters to clean up
here, but I'll call you tonight.

276
00:24:31,782 --> 00:24:34,902
I'll figure out a way
to help Howard, I swear.

277
00:24:35,022 --> 00:24:36,582
Just don't show him
to anybody else!

278
00:24:36,742 --> 00:24:38,462
Yeah, they look hungry.
Get them a banana.

279
00:24:38,582 --> 00:24:40,862
Hide him!
Take him to a movie!

280
00:24:40,982 --> 00:24:43,222
Look, I didn't know
where else to go for help.

281
00:24:43,382 --> 00:24:45,262
- Inside, Blumburtt.
- Coming. Coming.

282
00:24:45,502 --> 00:24:46,942
Howard, why are
you so pissed off?

283
00:24:47,062 --> 00:24:51,343
Why? Listen, if you got blasted
millions of miles through space...

284
00:24:51,543 --> 00:24:53,303
ended up on another
planet and were given...

285
00:24:53,423 --> 00:24:57,423
an I.Q. Test by a janitor,
you'd be pissed off too!

286
00:24:57,663 --> 00:24:59,583
Look, maybe you are trapped
in a world you never made...

287
00:24:59,703 --> 00:25:03,463
but, I got problems of my own.
My whole career is falling apart.

288
00:25:03,623 --> 00:25:06,823
Your career?
What about my life?

289
00:25:07,223 --> 00:25:10,824
- I'm stranded here, ship wrecked!
- Look at this wonderful exhibit.

290
00:25:10,984 --> 00:25:13,384
You see what I mean?
I'm a freak. An outcast.

291
00:25:13,544 --> 00:25:16,784
- It's so life-like and realistic.
- Bug off.

292
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:19,584
- Excuse me?
- I said, "beat it".

293
00:25:22,144 --> 00:25:24,544
Mutants.
You, too.

294
00:25:24,664 --> 00:25:27,704
- Leave me alone!
- What?

295
00:25:27,904 --> 00:25:32,144
I don't need any more of
your sympathy, your charity!

296
00:25:33,225 --> 00:25:36,705
Okay. Okay, fine.
I mean, I just found something...

297
00:25:36,905 --> 00:25:41,145
I meet somebody in a pretty weird
predicament and I was trying to help.

298
00:25:42,145 --> 00:25:46,705
But if that's the way you want it,
then so long, Ducky!

299
00:25:47,465 --> 00:25:49,825
Don't shed any
tears over me, Toots!

300
00:25:49,985 --> 00:25:51,705
You can wallow
in your own self pity!

301
00:25:51,825 --> 00:25:53,705
Right!
Well, who needs you?

302
00:25:53,865 --> 00:25:56,906
- I don't need anybody!
- Yeah, right.

303
00:25:58,266 --> 00:26:00,106
Yeah.

304
00:26:03,306 --> 00:26:08,386
Damn it! I can't sit here on my tail
feathers feeling sorry for myself.

305
00:26:08,586 --> 00:26:10,986
I've got to think
about practical matter.

306
00:26:11,146 --> 00:26:14,666
Food, shelter, a job.

307
00:26:23,147 --> 00:26:27,347
Now you do know
why you were sent to me?

308
00:26:27,467 --> 00:26:30,387
My continuing
streak of bad luck?

309
00:26:31,587 --> 00:26:34,227
You've been sent to me because
I'm famous for finding job...

310
00:26:34,347 --> 00:26:37,547
for little slackers like you.
That's right.

311
00:26:37,707 --> 00:26:41,028
They send me all the psycho cases.
All the misfits.

312
00:26:41,148 --> 00:26:43,948
All the phonies and
the fakers who think that...

313
00:26:44,068 --> 00:26:45,868
by traipsing in here
looking outlandish...

314
00:26:45,988 --> 00:26:48,268
they're not gonna
be able to find work!

315
00:26:48,388 --> 00:26:51,908
It's my fault I gotta shoplift at
the little tyke section of goodwill?

316
00:26:52,028 --> 00:26:55,588
I'm not talking about your clothes,
I'm talking about your face.

317
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:59,188
You think that by looking
controversial, you're never...

318
00:26:59,308 --> 00:27:02,949
gonna find a job and just
go on collecting unemployment...

319
00:27:03,069 --> 00:27:05,029
and living happy
on the public dough.

320
00:27:05,229 --> 00:27:08,229
Well, dude, you've got
another think coming!

321
00:27:08,389 --> 00:27:11,109
Because Cora Mae always
places her interviewee.

322
00:27:12,989 --> 00:27:14,909
I'm gonna
find your ass a job.

323
00:27:15,029 --> 00:27:20,509
That'll wipe that snarl right off
your face, little whatever you is.

324
00:27:21,469 --> 00:27:25,550
In fact, I think I got
just the position for you!

325
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:36,630
I got a feeling you're gonna take
to this job like a duck to water.

326
00:27:45,791 --> 00:27:48,391
Towels, lotion?

327
00:27:48,911 --> 00:27:50,831
Antibiotics?

328
00:27:58,671 --> 00:28:00,591
It must mating season.

329
00:28:04,551 --> 00:28:09,272
Creepy little dude.
Shorty?

330
00:28:11,032 --> 00:28:15,072
It's Howard, thank you,
and I'm taking a break.

331
00:28:15,712 --> 00:28:17,232
Pardon me,
Your Aloneness...

332
00:28:17,392 --> 00:28:21,952
but we seem to have a plugged
up airjet in number five.

333
00:28:22,072 --> 00:28:26,432
- And?
- And since you are supposed...

334
00:28:26,552 --> 00:28:31,473
to be the water expert I asked for,
you are going to fix it!

335
00:28:32,433 --> 00:28:33,713
No!

336
00:28:33,993 --> 00:28:35,473
No, no, no, wait, wait.
I got a better Idea!

337
00:28:35,633 --> 00:28:37,953
Wait, wait.
I can't swim!

338
00:28:38,073 --> 00:28:39,993
Kid, guess I slipped.

339
00:28:50,193 --> 00:28:52,194
Don't mind me.

340
00:28:56,794 --> 00:28:59,634
Oh, I leave that creepy little dude
in here to clean this place up...

341
00:28:59,794 --> 00:29:01,714
How am I supposed to run
a class...

342
00:29:03,234 --> 00:29:05,074
Guess I slipped.

343
00:29:05,514 --> 00:29:07,834
Just came by to tell you...

344
00:29:07,994 --> 00:29:09,634
I quit!

345
00:29:47,916 --> 00:29:50,076
Excuse me.
Getting off. My stop.

346
00:29:50,516 --> 00:29:53,596
Hi, there. How are you?
Good to see you.

347
00:29:54,796 --> 00:29:57,396
Yeah, same to you!

348
00:29:57,556 --> 00:29:59,597
Urban jungle!
Geez!

349
00:30:00,797 --> 00:30:02,517
- What is that?
- That's a duck...

350
00:30:02,677 --> 00:30:04,917
- What is that thing?
- That's a duck, man!

351
00:30:05,717 --> 00:30:08,677
Forecasting our week of fair weather
for you duck hunters...

352
00:30:08,797 --> 00:30:12,397
- for what reported, Steve Cannelli.
- Well, Bob...

353
00:30:12,557 --> 00:30:15,437
it's time to dust off those decoys
and practice that squawking...

354
00:30:15,637 --> 00:30:17,997
because duck hunting season
has officially opened.

355
00:30:18,157 --> 00:30:19,317
- Duck hunting?
- The Live Wild Commission...

356
00:30:19,477 --> 00:30:21,878
has actually doubled the limit
of ducks that can be shot.

357
00:30:22,038 --> 00:30:23,238
Shot?

358
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:30,198
This Duck has come to America
with Duck A Roni.

359
00:30:30,318 --> 00:30:31,678
No!

360
00:30:31,838 --> 00:30:33,838
But if every hunter could blast
fifteen of those in the sky...

361
00:30:34,158 --> 00:30:37,038
Hey, buddy, what's the rush?

362
00:32:16,243 --> 00:32:18,603
This way is too depressing.

363
00:32:21,883 --> 00:32:23,443
Give me a beat!

364
00:32:24,003 --> 00:32:26,243
One, two, three, four!

365
00:32:31,083 --> 00:32:33,204
Honey, I love you!
I love you!

366
00:32:33,404 --> 00:32:37,444
I'm right here. Beverly, I'm yours
after the show. Alright.

367
00:32:40,364 --> 00:32:45,284
- Here's the money for the girls.
- I'll make sure they get it.

368
00:32:46,524 --> 00:32:48,724
- Yeah, I'll bet. When?
- When?

369
00:32:48,924 --> 00:32:51,644
When Beaudacious Beverly stops
holding out to me.

370
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:52,884
I'm gonna invite her up
to my place tonight...

371
00:32:53,004 --> 00:32:55,365
for a little
career manipulation.

372
00:32:57,765 --> 00:33:02,765
I guess you must be the girls'
manager. And if you are...

373
00:33:03,085 --> 00:33:06,005
I don't like the way you're talking
about Beverly.

374
00:33:06,685 --> 00:33:09,365
And I want the girl's money!

375
00:33:09,485 --> 00:33:12,605
- Ritchie? Would you... What is that?
- Oh, look, Ginger...

376
00:33:12,765 --> 00:33:15,125
I warned you when you got into
Rock Management...

377
00:33:15,285 --> 00:33:17,526
you'd be dealing with
entertainment types.

378
00:33:17,646 --> 00:33:20,166
You know, different strokes
and all that?

379
00:33:20,326 --> 00:33:24,486
Different life styles is one thing,
different life forms is another.

380
00:33:30,526 --> 00:33:34,086
I'm not in a real good mood
tonight, Ginger.

381
00:33:34,206 --> 00:33:36,606
I want the girls' money.

382
00:33:36,766 --> 00:33:40,847
Now, is this gonna be easy...

383
00:33:41,887 --> 00:33:46,407
- or is this gonna be trouble?
- Hey, Ritchie...

384
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:50,527
tell it to go away. I'm not up all
my barnyard languages.

385
00:33:50,767 --> 00:33:53,807
Okay, Duck, out! You're gone!
You're history!

386
00:33:53,927 --> 00:33:56,007
You little wise pecker!

387
00:33:56,127 --> 00:33:57,927
Arrevidici, Duck!

388
00:34:01,047 --> 00:34:04,248
- Mallard in the side pocket.
- Adios, quack man.

389
00:34:04,968 --> 00:34:06,568
Very nicely done.

390
00:34:08,648 --> 00:34:10,928
Hey, what's going on
out there now?

391
00:34:24,569 --> 00:34:29,569
- All right, now it's my turn!
- Hey, come on, Duck!

392
00:34:29,729 --> 00:34:31,169
Take your best shot!

393
00:34:32,769 --> 00:34:35,089
- You got it!
- Ritchie!

394
00:34:44,209 --> 00:34:46,050
Stuck-a-bob!

395
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:51,010
No!

396
00:34:56,930 --> 00:35:00,650
No earring in your other ear?
I'll just make the hole myself.

397
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:02,970
No, please, man, no,
man, please! Don't!

398
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:04,450
- The money!
- Sure. Sure, here!

399
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:06,890
You take the money!
Take it! It's your! Take it!

400
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:09,851
And, you're no longer
their manager!

401
00:35:09,971 --> 00:35:12,131
Listen, okay.
Everybody in here is a witness.

402
00:35:12,291 --> 00:35:14,651
I'm letting the girls out of
their contract, okay?

403
00:35:14,771 --> 00:35:16,651
- Tell your goons to stay back!
- I'm warning you!

404
00:35:16,771 --> 00:35:18,491
- Get back, Ritchie!
- I bite your face...

405
00:35:18,611 --> 00:35:21,291
- you're a dead man, Ginger!
- What are you talking about?

406
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:23,931
Space rabies!

407
00:35:24,091 --> 00:35:26,611
- Ritchie, is that a real disease?
- I don't know, Ging...

408
00:35:26,731 --> 00:35:28,771
I heard something about
that on the news.

409
00:35:28,931 --> 00:35:32,812
That's right, Space Rabies!
Yeah, one bite, and...

410
00:35:32,932 --> 00:35:36,732
it's agonizing death in 15 seconds.
Bite, bite. Bite!

411
00:35:43,092 --> 00:35:45,452
We're all music lovers, huh?

412
00:35:47,372 --> 00:35:48,972
What a guy.

413
00:35:50,772 --> 00:35:53,573
- Those guys are a bunch of fools.
- Obviously the wrong crowd.

414
00:35:53,733 --> 00:35:56,733
I'm running out of sticks to
throw at these people! Sucks!

415
00:35:56,973 --> 00:35:59,013
- Now who?
- Look, tell him to go away.

416
00:36:03,693 --> 00:36:07,973
Down here, doll.
Is Beverly in?

417
00:36:08,893 --> 00:36:11,893
Geez, you must be K. C...

418
00:36:12,333 --> 00:36:15,654
- Meet Howard.
- Hi, oh, Howie.

419
00:36:16,134 --> 00:36:19,454
We've heard so much about you.
Of course, we didn't believe it.

420
00:36:19,814 --> 00:36:22,414
How weird.

421
00:36:23,974 --> 00:36:26,054
- Hi you, Ducky.
- Hi, Toots.

422
00:36:26,214 --> 00:36:27,854
How's the world been
treating you?

423
00:36:29,094 --> 00:36:32,494
- Guess.
- I was worried about you.

424
00:36:32,654 --> 00:36:35,014
- I missed you.
- Well, sex appeal...

425
00:36:35,174 --> 00:36:36,655
some guys got it...

426
00:36:36,815 --> 00:36:39,815
- and some guys don't.
- Howard?

427
00:36:40,535 --> 00:36:43,895
Listen, I'm sorry we fought.
You're the only friend...

428
00:36:44,015 --> 00:36:45,735
I've got here.

429
00:36:49,815 --> 00:36:52,935
Hi, sorry I missed the show.
I came to watch you undress, though.

430
00:36:53,095 --> 00:36:55,215
And I brought a pizza.

431
00:36:55,335 --> 00:36:57,055
Howard!

432
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:01,376
Boy!

433
00:37:01,576 --> 00:37:03,256
Thank God you're back.
I've been working on...

434
00:37:03,376 --> 00:37:06,016
- the mystery of your arrival.
- What's he doing here?

435
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:08,416
Well, he and Ronette have sort
of got back together.

436
00:37:08,536 --> 00:37:11,576
I don't know who's more desperate
for dates, you or me.

437
00:37:11,736 --> 00:37:13,056
What?

438
00:37:13,216 --> 00:37:15,816
Anyway, Howard, I was talking
to some Astro-physicists.

439
00:37:15,976 --> 00:37:18,016
You know, the guys who discovered
that Aztecs came from Mars?

440
00:37:18,216 --> 00:37:19,576
- Well, these guys concluded...
- No!

441
00:37:19,776 --> 00:37:21,857
That you arrived here in a space
craft millions of years ago, and...

442
00:37:22,017 --> 00:37:24,537
- must've remained frozen in ice.
- Go away!

443
00:37:24,697 --> 00:37:26,337
Ronette, could you
shut this boy up?

444
00:37:26,537 --> 00:37:28,057
- Howard...
- What's a pizza?

445
00:37:28,177 --> 00:37:30,057
It's a circular Italian food object.
Howard...

446
00:37:30,217 --> 00:37:32,417
I didn't buy that theory either,
so I did some research...

447
00:37:32,577 --> 00:37:35,657
and I discovered an ancient race
of large ducks worshipped by...

448
00:37:35,817 --> 00:37:39,017
- primitive Somoans.
- Leave me alone!

449
00:37:40,137 --> 00:37:43,578
I was barking up the wrong tree.
I knew that. But...

450
00:37:43,698 --> 00:37:46,858
tonight I am getting concrete
evidence about how you got here.

451
00:37:47,498 --> 00:37:49,818
Wait a minute.
Oh, I gotta make a call.

452
00:37:50,738 --> 00:37:52,778
- Phil?
- No sex now, I'm working.

453
00:37:52,938 --> 00:37:54,658
Got a place to stay tonight?

454
00:38:00,138 --> 00:38:03,018
Yeah, by the way I forgot.
I had a little talk...

455
00:38:03,138 --> 00:38:05,819
- with your manager Ginger?
- You talked to that slime?

456
00:38:05,939 --> 00:38:08,459
- What for?
- I got your money from him.

457
00:38:08,779 --> 00:38:10,579
Ducky, I can't believe this.

458
00:38:10,739 --> 00:38:14,259
I also got him to agree that it
was time for him to step aside...

459
00:38:14,379 --> 00:38:15,819
- as your manager.
- What?

460
00:38:15,979 --> 00:38:18,459
- You got rid of Ginger?
- Mr. Duck, you're wonderful.

461
00:38:19,659 --> 00:38:21,379
This is it!
I'm out of here!

462
00:38:21,539 --> 00:38:22,739
- Good.
- Howard...

463
00:38:22,859 --> 00:38:24,859
I'm about to meet secretly
with my colleague...

464
00:38:24,979 --> 00:38:27,460
- and he's bringing The Feather.
- What feather?

465
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:29,380
- What are you talking...
- If it matches...

466
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:31,380
- it'll be the answer to your problems.
- Matches?

467
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,260
No, you don't!
Stay away from me!

468
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,860
- You leave him alone!
- Let me through!

469
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,460
Philip, you're a drip!

470
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:40,780
I'm about to unravel
the mystery of your arrival!

471
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:44,100
- Come back here, your hairless ape!
- You'll have time to thank me later!

472
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:46,500
- Get out of here!
- We're gonna be famous.

473
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:50,061
- Are you okay?
- Ah, it's just my pride.

474
00:38:50,221 --> 00:38:52,061
We'll go home, Ducky.

475
00:39:37,263 --> 00:39:38,503
All right.

476
00:39:44,863 --> 00:39:45,983
Hey!

477
00:39:47,223 --> 00:39:50,423
- Little tune, I never finished.
- You play pretty good.

478
00:39:50,743 --> 00:39:54,543
I had a group in high school.
Howard and the Heartbreakers.

479
00:39:54,863 --> 00:39:59,504
Oh, heavy, Howard, very heavy.
Maybe you should be our manager.

480
00:40:00,704 --> 00:40:02,424
Wait a second.

481
00:40:03,664 --> 00:40:06,384
Maybe you're just the kind
of bazaar influence we need.

482
00:40:06,544 --> 00:40:11,504
- Forget it. No more jobs here.
- I think you'd be a great manager.

483
00:40:11,664 --> 00:40:15,224
- I'm gonna suggest it to the girls.
- I've given up trying to assimilate.

484
00:40:15,664 --> 00:40:18,025
I've gotta get back
to my own kind.

485
00:40:18,665 --> 00:40:21,225
Although...

486
00:40:21,465 --> 00:40:23,705
I have developed a greater
appreciation...

487
00:40:23,865 --> 00:40:26,345
for the female version of the
human anatomy.

488
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,945
Howard,
you really are the worst.

489
00:40:31,145 --> 00:40:33,665
Come on,
let's watch David Letterman.

490
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:35,785
Come on.

491
00:40:36,105 --> 00:40:37,785
- Okey-dokey.
- You know...

492
00:40:37,905 --> 00:40:40,066
I got a felling my life's really
gonna change...

493
00:40:40,186 --> 00:40:43,106
- since you fell into it, Ducky.
- Yeah, well...

494
00:40:43,266 --> 00:40:45,626
- I'm glad somebody's happy.
- If I could just get...

495
00:40:45,746 --> 00:40:47,426
my career back on course
I'd only have...

496
00:40:47,546 --> 00:40:49,426
the old standard worry left.

497
00:40:49,546 --> 00:40:51,026
- What's that?
- I just can't seem...

498
00:40:51,186 --> 00:40:54,826
- to find the right man.
- Maybe it's not a man...

499
00:40:54,946 --> 00:40:56,866
you should be looking for.

500
00:40:58,466 --> 00:41:02,067
You think I might find happiness
in the animal kingdom, Ducky?

501
00:41:02,227 --> 00:41:08,027
Like they say, doll, love's strange.
We could always give it a try.

502
00:41:13,947 --> 00:41:15,387
Okay...

503
00:41:15,827 --> 00:41:18,227
Let's go for it, Mr. Macho.

504
00:41:18,547 --> 00:41:21,387
What do you mean? Okay?
It was a joke.

505
00:41:23,227 --> 00:41:27,388
- Listen, I'm pretty tired.
- It's just that you're so...

506
00:41:27,508 --> 00:41:31,908
- incredibly soft and cuddly.
- Bev, let's be realistic.

507
00:41:32,108 --> 00:41:34,948
I mean, my apartment's zillions
of miles from here.

508
00:41:35,788 --> 00:41:39,308
- You're three feet taller that I am.
- I just can't resist...

509
00:41:39,508 --> 00:41:42,268
your intense
animal magnetism.

510
00:41:45,508 --> 00:41:49,069
Anyway, where will it all lead?
Marriage, kids...

511
00:41:49,269 --> 00:41:53,229
- a house in the suburbs?
- Let's just face it.

512
00:41:53,389 --> 00:41:55,949
- It's fate.
- No, it's not!

513
00:41:57,589 --> 00:42:01,309
- I've got a headache.
- And I've got the aspirin.

514
00:42:02,029 --> 00:42:03,549
Be gentle.

515
00:42:04,109 --> 00:42:07,029
Just one good night kiss
sweet Ducky?

516
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:11,750
Come on, Howard,
I was just kidding.

517
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:13,270
Good night.

518
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:31,951
My God.
This relationship...

519
00:42:32,111 --> 00:42:35,231
- it defies all the laws of nature.
- No, it doesn't.

520
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:38,711
This is not what you think.
We're just very good friends.

521
00:42:40,191 --> 00:42:42,831
- Phil?
- I'm sorry. The door was open.

522
00:42:42,991 --> 00:42:46,031
- Who the hell are they?
- This is my friend Carter...

523
00:42:46,311 --> 00:42:49,831
and, this is Dr. Walter Jenning.
And I told them all about you...

524
00:42:49,951 --> 00:42:52,111
- Howard.
- You were obviously right.

525
00:42:52,312 --> 00:42:54,952
- Show, show him the evidence.
- What evidence?

526
00:42:55,312 --> 00:42:58,392
We tested them, and they're both
from the same fowl.

527
00:42:58,752 --> 00:42:59,992
You, Howard.

528
00:43:00,792 --> 00:43:04,232
- My feathers?
- Howard, Howard, don't go beserk!

529
00:43:04,352 --> 00:43:06,192
- No!
- On my planet, we never say die...

530
00:43:06,312 --> 00:43:08,352
- we say kill!
- Now, wait a minute.

531
00:43:08,472 --> 00:43:10,272
Listen to me, Small Visitor.

532
00:43:11,552 --> 00:43:14,393
I can explain
how you got here.

533
00:43:16,153 --> 00:43:19,273
Dr Jenning is in charge of the
Astro-Physics Lab at Dyna-Technics.

534
00:43:19,633 --> 00:43:21,993
- Now, on the night of September 18th.
- That's the night Howard landed.

535
00:43:22,153 --> 00:43:25,513
Yes, now on that night we were
initiating our first full scale...

536
00:43:25,673 --> 00:43:28,473
- test of the Laser Spectra scope.
- It was shot during the experiment.

537
00:43:28,673 --> 00:43:30,873
It was just a routine procedure
meant to measure...

538
00:43:31,033 --> 00:43:33,953
the density of the gases that
surround the Alpha Centauri.

539
00:43:34,193 --> 00:43:37,194
However, part way through the
experiment, there was a...

540
00:43:37,314 --> 00:43:38,834
a deviation and...

541
00:43:39,234 --> 00:43:42,034
we lost control of the
laser spectra scope.

542
00:43:42,154 --> 00:43:46,274
- What do you mean "lost control"?
- Some unknown force...

543
00:43:46,394 --> 00:43:49,874
was re-directing the laser beam from
its original target so that it hit...

544
00:43:50,034 --> 00:43:52,154
- your planet instead.
- Hit my planet?

545
00:43:52,314 --> 00:43:55,714
How about hitting my living room?
Talk about an invasion of privacy?

546
00:43:55,874 --> 00:43:58,835
When the beam hit, you must have
been caught up in a massive...

547
00:43:58,955 --> 00:44:02,315
energy inversion, which literally
dragged you through space...

548
00:44:02,475 --> 00:44:04,755
back to the power source
here on earth.

549
00:44:04,915 --> 00:44:07,515
- Radical.
- In the lab that night...

550
00:44:07,675 --> 00:44:10,395
we saw a single feather fall.

551
00:44:16,635 --> 00:44:18,555
We weren't aware that the rest
of you, Howard...

552
00:44:18,715 --> 00:44:22,596
had landed in that alley just
two miles away. Any questions?

553
00:44:22,716 --> 00:44:25,276
Yeah.
Where are my pants?

554
00:44:26,276 --> 00:44:28,276
- Howard, where you going?
- To this lab of theirs.

555
00:44:28,476 --> 00:44:30,116
- What for?
- To hop back on board...

556
00:44:30,276 --> 00:44:33,236
that laser thing. Then all you have
to do is hit the reverse lever...

557
00:44:33,436 --> 00:44:35,316
to send me back home.
Right?

558
00:44:35,436 --> 00:44:37,836
Well, we hadn't considered
reversing the process.

559
00:44:37,996 --> 00:44:39,316
- I, I don't think it's feasible.
- Me, either.

560
00:44:39,476 --> 00:44:41,276
Now, wait a minute.
If we could generate...

561
00:44:41,436 --> 00:44:43,837
- a strong enough hyper-charge...
- You can't do that.

562
00:44:43,997 --> 00:44:46,597
You mean the reflex mode might
provoke a total reversal?

563
00:44:46,717 --> 00:44:48,437
- Itjust might be possible.
- It won't work.

564
00:44:48,597 --> 00:44:49,717
- Yeah.
- Sir.

565
00:44:49,837 --> 00:44:51,837
Don't, don't listen to them, Howard.
I have got you booked...

566
00:44:51,997 --> 00:44:55,757
on A.M. Cleveland. We can get the
cover of Science Digest. We, we...

567
00:44:55,917 --> 00:44:57,597
- Butt Out, four-eyes.
- Yeah.

568
00:44:57,877 --> 00:45:00,437
Look, you guys, could you
really send him back?

569
00:45:00,637 --> 00:45:03,637
If we did, we could establish a
continuing link between our planets.

570
00:45:03,797 --> 00:45:06,838
But, he would have to leave tonight
while the alignment still exists.

571
00:45:06,958 --> 00:45:08,478
- We can't afford to wait.
- You mean...

572
00:45:08,638 --> 00:45:10,518
I'm finally gonna breeze
this fly trap?

573
00:45:10,678 --> 00:45:13,398
Ducky, this is what you wanted.
You're going home.

574
00:45:13,558 --> 00:45:14,598
- Yeah.
- Right.

575
00:45:14,718 --> 00:45:17,398
Carter, call Larry have him set up
the initiation procedure.

576
00:45:17,598 --> 00:45:19,638
Tell him I'll meet him at the lab
right away. You and Blumburtt...

577
00:45:19,758 --> 00:45:22,998
can bring Howard. You are about to
make history a second time...

578
00:45:23,158 --> 00:45:25,238
- my little friend.
- Thanks...

579
00:45:25,438 --> 00:45:27,159
but once was plenty.

580
00:45:27,799 --> 00:45:28,679
- Get to it.
- Right.

581
00:45:28,799 --> 00:45:32,439
You know, Howard, we could
hold out for a PBS special.

582
00:45:32,599 --> 00:45:33,399
Phil!

583
00:45:34,039 --> 00:45:36,879
Bev, get dressed. Aren't
you gonna see me off?

584
00:45:36,999 --> 00:45:40,119
Sure I am. I just hope they
let you take a carry-on bag.

585
00:45:40,639 --> 00:45:43,759
Look, I'm gonna put on these
Polaroids that we took at the Club.

586
00:45:43,919 --> 00:45:46,559
Thanks.
These'll help...

587
00:45:46,719 --> 00:45:49,280
or the guys back home
are never gonna believe me.

588
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:55,000
- What's this in my bag?
- Souvenirs?

589
00:45:56,320 --> 00:46:00,200
- I'm gonna miss you a lot, Ducky.
- Bev...

590
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:03,280
I don't belong here.
You know I've gotta go.

591
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:06,840
Yeah.

592
00:46:17,961 --> 00:46:21,281
Lily had the dolphins.
Cousteau, the whales.

593
00:46:21,641 --> 00:46:25,081
Goudall gorillas.
I had a duck.

594
00:46:26,561 --> 00:46:28,761
I could have been
a contender.

595
00:46:31,681 --> 00:46:36,042
Bev?
I'm not a real sentimental guy.

596
00:46:36,602 --> 00:46:41,522
No, I bet you were born from
a very hard-boiled egg, Ducky.

597
00:46:42,402 --> 00:46:45,682
Yeah. But, I do keep wondering...

598
00:46:45,842 --> 00:46:49,602
of all the alleys in the world
I could have fallen into that night.

599
00:46:49,842 --> 00:46:54,162
Why did it have to be yours?
Because, right now...

600
00:46:54,682 --> 00:46:58,883
you're the one and only thing that's
making it very hard for me to leave.

601
00:47:13,243 --> 00:47:15,843
- There's no guard.
- We should go back then?

602
00:47:16,003 --> 00:47:16,603
Phil?

603
00:47:16,803 --> 00:47:18,244
- What?
- Drive.

604
00:47:35,204 --> 00:47:37,044
What are these alarms?

605
00:47:37,164 --> 00:47:38,524
- Something's happened.
- What's happened?

606
00:47:38,644 --> 00:47:39,564
I don't know.

607
00:47:39,804 --> 00:47:42,645
- That is really cool.
- Right. Hold it!

608
00:47:42,805 --> 00:47:44,285
Security!

609
00:47:46,565 --> 00:47:51,565
My eyes! My eyes! It exploded again!
It was terrible!

610
00:47:51,685 --> 00:47:54,605
We have no right to tamper
with the Universe.

611
00:47:57,765 --> 00:48:00,445
This does not hold well.

612
00:48:04,446 --> 00:48:05,526
Is he okay?

613
00:48:11,846 --> 00:48:14,526
Get out of the way!
- It's still hot!

614
00:48:14,686 --> 00:48:17,326
Get them out of here!
Head for the emergency exists.

615
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:34,287
Howard, where are you going?

616
00:48:34,727 --> 00:48:36,567
- Larry, where's Dr. Jenning?
- Carter, come here.

617
00:48:36,687 --> 00:48:37,887
Let me show you this.

618
00:48:38,047 --> 00:48:40,087
He was pre-activating the
laser spectra-scope...

619
00:48:40,327 --> 00:48:42,687
we lost control again and there
was another explosion.

620
00:48:42,847 --> 00:48:45,007
And, Jenning caught the full
force of the blast this time.

621
00:48:45,367 --> 00:48:47,488
- Is he all right? Where is he?
- You, you see the bottom...

622
00:48:47,648 --> 00:48:50,448
of the spectra scope, blew it
to the wall and Jenning just...

623
00:48:50,568 --> 00:48:53,248
- just disappeared.
- Excuse me.

624
00:48:53,408 --> 00:48:55,648
But is this gonna delay
my take-off?

625
00:48:56,008 --> 00:49:00,048
Is, is that it?
That's unbelievable!

626
00:49:00,408 --> 00:49:03,008
Yeah. We brought Howard down
the first time, but what if...

627
00:49:03,688 --> 00:49:07,208
God, Larry what if we brought down
something else this time?

628
00:49:10,009 --> 00:49:11,809
We're rounding up all the scientists
for you in the lab, sir...

629
00:49:11,969 --> 00:49:13,249
but I think you better take a look
at this other...

630
00:49:13,369 --> 00:49:17,289
- this other thing first.
- A thing... Hansen?

631
00:49:17,609 --> 00:49:19,889
Is that kind of precise,
descriptive techniques...

632
00:49:20,009 --> 00:49:22,529
they're teaching Rookies
nowadays? A thing?

633
00:49:22,689 --> 00:49:24,369
I, I wanna know what they're
doing with Howard in there?

634
00:49:24,969 --> 00:49:27,729
- Excuse me, are you in charge here?
- Yeah. Why?

635
00:49:27,889 --> 00:49:30,049
Well, I wanna know why they're
harassing Howard.

636
00:49:30,169 --> 00:49:31,050
Who's Howard?

637
00:49:31,210 --> 00:49:34,010
He had nothing to do with it.
Howard, Howard is just an innocent.

638
00:49:34,490 --> 00:49:36,930
- Thing?
- No, Duck!

639
00:49:37,810 --> 00:49:39,490
Just an innocent duck?

640
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:41,690
They wonder why I'm asking
for an early retirement...

641
00:49:41,810 --> 00:49:44,410
- you deal with this.
- Wait a second, you can't...

642
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:47,090
Herbie, you got
a 'thing' in here?

643
00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:48,970
Thing.

644
00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:52,771
I've had enough!
I wanna see my lawyer.

645
00:49:55,171 --> 00:49:57,851
I've got rights, you know?
I'm suing.

646
00:49:57,971 --> 00:49:59,331
Yeah.

647
00:50:00,571 --> 00:50:02,371
Goddamnit, Hansen, get in here
and get this friggen duck suit...

648
00:50:02,491 --> 00:50:03,691
- of this nut!
- Okay, sir.

649
00:50:05,971 --> 00:50:08,931
Hey, hey, let me go!
You big oafs!

650
00:50:09,091 --> 00:50:11,771
On my planet we never say...
die, we say...

651
00:50:12,011 --> 00:50:13,131
not my shorts!

652
00:50:15,212 --> 00:50:16,612
You perverts!

653
00:50:17,452 --> 00:50:19,932
- Lieutenant?
- Lieutenant, there's no zipper.

654
00:50:20,052 --> 00:50:21,852
There's no buttons.
No Velcro, sir.

655
00:50:22,012 --> 00:50:24,652
I think the suspect's
stuff is like inboard, sir.

656
00:50:25,092 --> 00:50:28,452
- Yeah. I, I think he's for real.
- If your goons are finished!

657
00:50:28,612 --> 00:50:29,732
Let go on me!

658
00:50:31,052 --> 00:50:34,532
I'd like a word with those
so-called scientists out there!

659
00:50:34,652 --> 00:50:36,652
- Oh, yeah? What about?
- About when they can rev up...

660
00:50:36,732 --> 00:50:39,533
- that machine and send me back home.
- Listen, Howard...

661
00:50:39,693 --> 00:50:41,493
I'm gonna go talk to
the scientists out there.

662
00:50:41,613 --> 00:50:43,973
You are gonna go play sitting
duck in a jail cell.

663
00:50:44,093 --> 00:50:47,613
- Lieutenant, what's the charge, sir?
- IIlegal alien.

664
00:50:48,693 --> 00:50:49,813
Come on.

665
00:50:49,973 --> 00:50:51,533
- I'll get the car.
- All right.

666
00:50:51,813 --> 00:50:54,893
Oh, a cigar!
All right, that's how it starts.

667
00:50:55,053 --> 00:50:56,413
Police brutality!

668
00:50:56,573 --> 00:50:59,814
- Hey, stop manhandling him!
- Hey, you can't come in here.

669
00:51:00,494 --> 00:51:02,414
Here's another one already lift.

670
00:51:02,574 --> 00:51:04,214
- Oh, nuts, I dropped my cigar.
- What?

671
00:51:04,334 --> 00:51:05,334
- Fire!
- Where?

672
00:51:05,974 --> 00:51:08,254
- Oh, Geez, that's all I need.
- So long, copper!

673
00:51:11,174 --> 00:51:13,814
Desperate ducks
commit desperate acts!

674
00:51:15,054 --> 00:51:16,694
Freeze!

675
00:51:18,534 --> 00:51:20,014
Book him, Ducko!

676
00:51:20,174 --> 00:51:22,495
Give her the keys to the cuffs,
Flatfoot!

677
00:51:24,095 --> 00:51:25,495
Yeah.

678
00:51:26,735 --> 00:51:28,615
What are you doing here
tonight? You got no ID.

679
00:51:28,735 --> 00:51:29,655
- Lieutenant?
- What?

680
00:51:29,775 --> 00:51:30,855
The duck got away.

681
00:51:31,175 --> 00:51:32,935
Shut up, fool!
Get him out of here!

682
00:51:33,055 --> 00:51:36,455
Over here on the double.
Okay. I want this guy.

683
00:51:36,535 --> 00:51:39,255
The suspect is three foot
one inches tall.

684
00:51:39,295 --> 00:51:41,695
- Three-two, thank you.
- You heard me.

685
00:51:41,815 --> 00:51:45,136
He's armed. That means
he's got a weapon, right?

686
00:51:45,816 --> 00:51:49,536
- That also means he's dangerous.
- Me?

687
00:51:49,656 --> 00:51:52,696
Extremely dangerous.

688
00:51:53,216 --> 00:51:54,776
Shoot to kill!

689
00:51:57,096 --> 00:51:59,296
Let's move it out!
Come on!

690
00:52:00,256 --> 00:52:01,976
Richard, come with me.

691
00:52:03,576 --> 00:52:04,576
Okay.

692
00:52:05,737 --> 00:52:07,097
Let's go.

693
00:52:13,537 --> 00:52:14,977
- No, don't shoot.
- We give up!

694
00:52:15,137 --> 00:52:17,017
- Time out!
- We surrender.

695
00:52:19,057 --> 00:52:22,017
- Dr. Jenning?
- What?

696
00:52:24,657 --> 00:52:27,217
- More cops, come on, hurry!
- What?

697
00:52:27,377 --> 00:52:28,338
- Come here.
- Get over here, Doc.

698
00:52:28,498 --> 00:52:30,978
- Howard, Howard...
- What?

699
00:52:34,138 --> 00:52:36,178
The laser spectra-scope
malfunctioned again.

700
00:52:36,338 --> 00:52:39,938
There was a tremendous
explosion and then...

701
00:52:40,058 --> 00:52:42,978
I must have blacked out. Then
suddenly I find myself out here.

702
00:52:47,538 --> 00:52:51,339
- Are they after you?
- Does 'shoot to kill' sound serious?

703
00:52:51,499 --> 00:52:52,779
I'm probably finished, too.

704
00:52:53,939 --> 00:52:55,939
Those experiments
weren't authorized.

705
00:52:56,179 --> 00:52:58,219
They're probably
gonna blame me.

706
00:53:00,419 --> 00:53:02,579
Oh, my God, he needs help.
Howard, maybe...

707
00:53:02,739 --> 00:53:05,379
- we all should get out of here.
- You got a car, Doc?

708
00:53:10,419 --> 00:53:13,260
What's wrong with me?
There's the back gate.

709
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:16,900
- Good, there's no cops.
- I don't have a gate key.

710
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:19,420
You've got a foot, don't you?
So step on it.

711
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:28,180
Lieutenant, a car crashed out
the back gate.

712
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:29,820
- Headed for Highway Five.
- All right, get out an All Points...

713
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:31,580
- Bulletin right now.
- Yes, sir!

714
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:36,141
How in the hell am I gonna explain
a manhunt for a duck?

715
00:53:36,581 --> 00:53:39,421
- It's a duck hunt.
- Hansen, please, don't, don't...

716
00:53:39,541 --> 00:53:41,261
don't start, please? Please?

717
00:53:42,181 --> 00:53:45,021
Can't you understand?
I'm telling you I saw something!

718
00:53:45,141 --> 00:53:47,061
Doc, you're in shock
from the explosion...

719
00:53:47,181 --> 00:53:50,141
- and you're imagining things.
- Watch where you're going, damn it!

720
00:53:57,982 --> 00:54:01,742
Listen, an evil has landed.
The world is in great danger.

721
00:54:01,942 --> 00:54:04,302
Yeah, it certainly is when
you're out on the highway.

722
00:54:04,462 --> 00:54:05,862
Look out!

723
00:54:11,022 --> 00:54:12,422
You're gonna get us killed.

724
00:54:12,542 --> 00:54:16,302
It feels like something inside me
gnawing at my guts!

725
00:54:16,462 --> 00:54:19,183
- What's wrong with me?
- Well, what did you have for lunch?

726
00:54:20,383 --> 00:54:23,023
Oh, boy!
Oh, boy!

727
00:54:33,183 --> 00:54:35,943
Come on, give us a break!
Don't close your eyes.

728
00:54:36,063 --> 00:54:37,023
The pain.

729
00:54:37,143 --> 00:54:40,304
It's like I'm transforming inside.
I'm afraid I'm about...

730
00:54:40,464 --> 00:54:42,624
- to become something else.
- Oh, great...

731
00:54:42,744 --> 00:54:45,384
- like a sex change or something.
- Something's growing inside me.

732
00:54:45,504 --> 00:54:48,224
It's replicating and superseding
all my intern organs!

733
00:54:48,464 --> 00:54:50,064
Well, stop at a bathroom, huh?

734
00:54:50,904 --> 00:54:53,704
That monster's shape I saw.

735
00:54:56,824 --> 00:54:59,384
- Jenning!
- It's inside my body.

736
00:54:59,784 --> 00:55:02,384
This guy's delirious.
He's not making any sense.

737
00:55:02,545 --> 00:55:04,865
It's too late.
The end of the world is coming...

738
00:55:04,985 --> 00:55:07,305
and I will be the cause of it.

739
00:55:07,865 --> 00:55:11,465
Jenning, man, slow down!
Steer you big yo-yo! Steer!

740
00:55:18,065 --> 00:55:21,985
Howard, step on the brake!
Howard, step on the brake!

741
00:55:27,626 --> 00:55:30,466
Oh, no!
White line, wrong way.

742
00:55:41,586 --> 00:55:44,746
- The brake! Push, Beverly, push!
- I'm trying!

743
00:55:59,707 --> 00:56:02,987
I'm dead.
Yes, you are.

744
00:56:03,107 --> 00:56:05,907
- You think that's funny, Jenning?
- I'm not Jenning any more.

745
00:56:06,027 --> 00:56:11,548
The transformation is complete.
I am now someone else.

746
00:56:11,708 --> 00:56:13,788
Try telling that to your
insurance company.

747
00:56:13,948 --> 00:56:16,788
I think he needs come coffee.
Come on.

748
00:56:27,228 --> 00:56:29,108
Oh, after you.

749
00:56:41,029 --> 00:56:41,869
Hey, sorry.

750
00:56:41,989 --> 00:56:44,589
This is why
I hate the night' shift.

751
00:56:45,949 --> 00:56:48,869
I'm sorry, we don't allow
pets on the premises.

752
00:56:48,989 --> 00:56:53,750
Hey, have a heart.
Seeing eye duck.

753
00:56:54,630 --> 00:56:56,630
Touching, isn't he?

754
00:56:57,670 --> 00:57:00,310
Not so tight. What are you doing?
Falling in love?

755
00:57:00,430 --> 00:57:02,430
Yeah, sit down.

756
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:04,750
I need a beer bad.
Gotta find a waitress.

757
00:57:04,870 --> 00:57:05,790
Yeah.

758
00:57:06,950 --> 00:57:11,110
- Hey, honey! You!
- Yeah, I'm coming.

759
00:57:12,150 --> 00:57:13,910
Here she comes.

760
00:57:14,910 --> 00:57:18,951
Your kid's costume is really radical.
I'll bet he's crazy about...

761
00:57:20,311 --> 00:57:23,191
Yeah, I'm very
attached to him.

762
00:57:23,551 --> 00:57:26,071
Your dad's sort
of in his own space.

763
00:57:26,191 --> 00:57:27,791
What do you think
he'd like to eat?

764
00:57:27,871 --> 00:57:31,511
I no longer need
human food.

765
00:57:32,271 --> 00:57:34,191
I know it's a drag, but you're
gonna have to order some food...

766
00:57:34,311 --> 00:57:37,792
if you wanna sit here, so how
about the specials on the menu?

767
00:57:40,512 --> 00:57:44,472
You are about to witness
the end of the old world...

768
00:57:44,632 --> 00:57:47,352
and the birth of the new.

769
00:57:47,512 --> 00:57:51,352
Hey, is he like one of those
TV Evangelists or something?

770
00:57:51,752 --> 00:57:53,192
- Yeah.
- Or something.

771
00:57:53,312 --> 00:57:55,512
- I'm gonna kill somebody.
- It's okay, Howard.

772
00:57:55,632 --> 00:57:57,792
Why don't we just have three
specials and three beers.

773
00:57:57,952 --> 00:57:58,872
Right.

774
00:58:01,473 --> 00:58:04,633
- Poor girl.
- Listen, Dr. J.

775
00:58:06,513 --> 00:58:09,233
If you could tune back
into reality for a second.

776
00:58:09,473 --> 00:58:12,273
I don't understand anything
you're talking about.

777
00:58:12,433 --> 00:58:16,313
All I know is I need that
laser machine to get me home.

778
00:58:16,473 --> 00:58:19,193
Is it still working, Jenning?
Jenning!

779
00:58:19,353 --> 00:58:23,834
I told you, bird brain,
I'm not Jenning any more!

780
00:58:24,034 --> 00:58:28,594
I am now one of the Dark
Over Lords of the Universe.

781
00:58:29,154 --> 00:58:33,274
- Dark Over Lord of the Universe?
- That must be quite a responsibility.

782
00:58:33,354 --> 00:58:37,714
Tonight the laser beam hit
the Nexus of Sominus.

783
00:58:37,914 --> 00:58:39,834
What is that?
A Suburb of Cleveland?

784
00:58:40,514 --> 00:58:45,235
It lied beyond the planets.
It's a region of demons...

785
00:58:45,635 --> 00:58:49,955
to which we Dark Over Lords
were exiled eons ago.

786
00:58:50,115 --> 00:58:53,715
- I hope you're getting all this.
- Howard, what I'm getting is that...

787
00:58:53,795 --> 00:58:56,435
- this man is very, very sick.
- Just as you...

788
00:58:56,555 --> 00:58:58,395
were brought down
here accidentally.

789
00:58:58,595 --> 00:59:02,875
Tonight the laser beam
released me from that...

790
00:59:02,995 --> 00:59:07,716
region of demons and
pulled me down into that lab.

791
00:59:08,196 --> 00:59:11,476
- Small universe.
- During the explosion...

792
00:59:11,596 --> 00:59:16,196
I entered Jenning's body.
So...

793
00:59:19,196 --> 00:59:21,916
I have disguised
my true form...

794
00:59:21,996 --> 00:59:27,636
which would be considered
hideous and revolting here.

795
00:59:28,797 --> 00:59:30,597
Lucky for the people eating.

796
00:59:34,037 --> 00:59:35,317
You ordered the specials,
what's wrong?

797
00:59:35,477 --> 00:59:40,637
This will mean the extinction
of all existing life forms.

798
00:59:40,797 --> 00:59:42,917
- You haven't even tasted it, yet.
- What do you think?

799
00:59:43,077 --> 00:59:44,597
I'm into cannibalism
or something?

800
00:59:44,837 --> 00:59:47,917
Hey, are we like all in
the same discussion here?

801
00:59:48,037 --> 00:59:50,958
I'll give you a hint, Doll.
What's white, ovid...

802
00:59:51,078 --> 00:59:52,998
and always reminds
me of my birthday?

803
00:59:53,278 --> 00:59:55,518
- I don't know.
- The eggs! Get them out of here!

804
00:59:56,358 --> 01:00:01,278
Gosh, you know, hostility
is like psychic boomerang.

805
01:00:01,878 --> 01:00:05,238
I can't believe this planet!
Fried eggs. Yuck!

806
01:00:05,598 --> 01:00:09,638
- Just bring the beer!
- Howard? Howard?

807
01:00:23,479 --> 01:00:25,279
- What happened?
- How the hell did you do that?

808
01:00:25,439 --> 01:00:27,959
- My powers are growing.
- Watch out!

809
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:30,399
- It is time now.
- What's that?

810
01:00:30,599 --> 01:00:33,999
It is the code key. It will
activate the laser spectra scope...

811
01:00:34,159 --> 01:00:38,360
when I use it tonight to bring
down the other Dark Over Lords.

812
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:40,720
- The others?
- Now he's got a whole gang.

813
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:43,280
Well, screw them.
I got dibs on the laser first.

814
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:45,760
Gimme that code hey.
That's my ticket home!

815
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:57,001
- Look at his hand!
- It's nothing. Look at his face!

816
01:00:58,561 --> 01:01:02,281
Yes. Soon the Dark Over
Lords will engulf the Earth.

817
01:01:02,601 --> 01:01:07,881
- Nothing human will remain here.
- Nothing ducks will remain either!

818
01:01:08,041 --> 01:01:10,761
- Move, we're going!
- You will get the check?

819
01:01:11,361 --> 01:01:13,041
Hate to eat and run.

820
01:01:13,201 --> 01:01:15,321
- Hello there.
- Get out of the way.

821
01:01:15,401 --> 01:01:17,761
- Hey, look the talking duck.
- Bug off!

822
01:01:17,881 --> 01:01:22,002
- Lord, what is that?
- You jackass, he's a ventriloquist.

823
01:01:22,122 --> 01:01:24,482
These guy here is doing the talking
and this here's the dummy.

824
01:01:24,642 --> 01:01:26,042
Go ahead,
say something, dummy!

825
01:01:26,162 --> 01:01:29,122
You might not wanna hear
what I'll say, Bozo!

826
01:01:29,882 --> 01:01:32,442
Did you make him
say that, Jerk Off?

827
01:01:33,922 --> 01:01:36,762
Leave him alone! He was
just in an industrial accident.

828
01:01:36,922 --> 01:01:38,322
- So take a hike, Cowboy!
- You...

829
01:01:38,642 --> 01:01:40,562
- You're a dead duck!
- Hey!

830
01:01:40,723 --> 01:01:42,563
What's this? The key
to your duck mobile?

831
01:01:42,723 --> 01:01:44,163
Gimme that or
you're gonna be sorry.

832
01:01:44,363 --> 01:01:46,403
Better watch out he's
a master of Quack-foo!

833
01:01:46,603 --> 01:01:47,923
I'll Quack-foo him!

834
01:01:48,563 --> 01:01:49,763
Bullies!

835
01:01:50,323 --> 01:01:53,323
Put me down!
Come on that front.

836
01:01:53,483 --> 01:01:56,283
All nice!
Going up! I'm going.

837
01:02:02,403 --> 01:02:04,524
This one's for you, Cracker!

838
01:02:05,444 --> 01:02:08,404
- Good shot! Good shot!
- Another hungry customer!

839
01:02:09,404 --> 01:02:13,084
- You...
- Toro, toro! Ole!

840
01:02:13,724 --> 01:02:15,964
I'm gonna get you,
you dumb duck!

841
01:02:17,124 --> 01:02:18,604
Hey, boy!

842
01:02:23,044 --> 01:02:25,325
Call the police!
Not the police!

843
01:02:25,445 --> 01:02:27,285
Call somebody else!
They're gonna hurt Howard.

844
01:02:27,445 --> 01:02:32,405
An evil unlike any you can imagine
is about to engulf the Earth.

845
01:02:32,525 --> 01:02:35,005
No, no, we have fights
in here all the time.

846
01:02:35,205 --> 01:02:40,125
- Man, Jenning! Your order is ready.
- Are you gonna just sit there?

847
01:02:40,445 --> 01:02:43,405
- She took my eggs!
- One special!

848
01:02:44,565 --> 01:02:46,445
- Howard!
- Beverly!

849
01:02:47,206 --> 01:02:49,166
- Howard!
- Jenning!

850
01:02:49,326 --> 01:02:53,286
- I could use some help here, Buddy!
- Come on, let's get out of here!

851
01:02:56,806 --> 01:02:57,886
Howard?

852
01:02:58,726 --> 01:03:02,006
You're not getting away now,
you stinking little bird!

853
01:03:02,406 --> 01:03:05,406
Put me down!
Put me down right now!

854
01:03:06,046 --> 01:03:10,647
Put him down! Howard maybe
a duck but you people are animals!

855
01:03:10,967 --> 01:03:17,247
- He's my boyfriend!
- That's disgusting.

856
01:03:17,807 --> 01:03:19,567
You don't make me
proud to be a human!

857
01:03:19,727 --> 01:03:21,727
Let me just pay the
check and I'm out of here.

858
01:03:23,367 --> 01:03:24,527
I can't believe that you're
just sitting here.

859
01:03:24,687 --> 01:03:26,447
Look what they're
doing to Howard!

860
01:03:27,567 --> 01:03:29,927
- Geez!
- Chicken fry!

861
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:31,928
Where's the SPCA
when you need them?

862
01:03:32,048 --> 01:03:35,688
- I am not immune.
- I'm gonna barbecue your bill, bird.

863
01:03:35,808 --> 01:03:38,088
Great duck in heaven,
this is the end of Howard.

864
01:03:38,168 --> 01:03:40,528
There's gonna be more violence!
I hate violence!

865
01:03:40,648 --> 01:03:42,608
You gotta go in there
and beat them up.

866
01:03:42,728 --> 01:03:46,088
Jenning! Jenning, don't
just sit there! This is serious!

867
01:03:46,248 --> 01:03:48,768
- They're gonna cook me!
- Take that!

868
01:03:50,488 --> 01:03:55,089
- Any last words?
- Yeah, Jenning!

869
01:03:55,849 --> 01:03:59,129
- He's my favorite duck.
- You hardly know him.

870
01:03:59,249 --> 01:04:02,689
Jenning! They're seasoning me!
Wait, you better let me up.

871
01:04:02,809 --> 01:04:05,969
- You don't wanna get my friend angry!
- Yeah? Why?

872
01:04:06,129 --> 01:04:08,929
Because he's one of the
Dark Over Lords of the Universe.

873
01:04:09,089 --> 01:04:11,849
And he can destroy
you and the Earth, everything.

874
01:04:14,569 --> 01:04:17,010
Yeah, well, I didn't
buy it at first either.

875
01:04:17,170 --> 01:04:21,290
Look, they're laughing at you
and they've got Mr. Code Key.

876
01:04:23,410 --> 01:04:25,770
My God!

877
01:04:26,290 --> 01:04:29,930
- One, two...
- Wait a minute! Jenning!

878
01:04:30,450 --> 01:04:33,770
Look! I warned you!
Here he comes!

879
01:04:48,451 --> 01:04:52,971
- He must have ate the chili.
- Release the small water fowl!

880
01:04:55,091 --> 01:04:58,451
- Bring me the Code Key, Howard.
- Right! The Code Key!

881
01:04:58,611 --> 01:05:00,852
You heard him!
Cut me loose!

882
01:05:00,972 --> 01:05:05,412
Sounds like a brunch of
bull puckie to me!

883
01:05:06,732 --> 01:05:07,452
My God!

884
01:05:22,733 --> 01:05:24,573
My God!

885
01:05:32,533 --> 01:05:35,293
- Are you okay, Howard?
- Yes.

886
01:05:35,573 --> 01:05:38,053
- Enough of this crap!
- You out of here!

887
01:05:40,213 --> 01:05:43,853
If you can't take the heat,
get out of that kitchen!

888
01:05:49,974 --> 01:05:54,294
- Where's the Code Key?
- It's closing time!

889
01:05:58,294 --> 01:06:02,934
The Code Key! It's not nice
to fool with the Dark Over Lord.

890
01:06:17,735 --> 01:06:22,095
- They get the point, Jenning!
- Get out of the way!

891
01:06:34,056 --> 01:06:36,816
- Now's our chance.
- Yeah, come on. This way.

892
01:06:39,056 --> 01:06:40,856
Cut it out, Howard.

893
01:06:43,656 --> 01:06:47,696
- Going somewhere?
- Yeah, without you!

894
01:06:59,657 --> 01:07:03,377
- Move the table out of the way!
- I can't, it's stuck!

895
01:07:04,377 --> 01:07:06,057
What's wrong?

896
01:07:08,417 --> 01:07:09,977
Howard, get down from there!

897
01:07:10,857 --> 01:07:14,098
- Like I'm doing this on purpose?
- Give me the Code Key!

898
01:07:14,218 --> 01:07:16,378
Yeah? What if I don't?

899
01:07:18,018 --> 01:07:21,018
Can't you take a joke?
Geez, you broke my head.

900
01:07:32,098 --> 01:07:36,059
I will now bring down
the other Dark Over Lords.

901
01:07:36,219 --> 01:07:38,259
Hey, what about me?

902
01:07:49,299 --> 01:07:52,019
You filthy scum bucket!

903
01:08:12,940 --> 01:08:14,180
Run!

904
01:08:15,740 --> 01:08:17,940
No! Beverly!

905
01:08:23,421 --> 01:08:24,821
Beverly?

906
01:08:31,861 --> 01:08:33,461
Howard, look out!

907
01:08:35,821 --> 01:08:38,901
You killed him!
You killed him!

908
01:08:42,182 --> 01:08:45,622
Beverly, I'll find you!

909
01:08:53,182 --> 01:08:57,342
- I need your body.
- You creep, I've that one before!

910
01:08:57,462 --> 01:09:00,982
The Dark Over Lords cannot
exist on this planet unless...

911
01:09:01,062 --> 01:09:07,543
- they grow inside a human body.
- God, no!

912
01:09:12,503 --> 01:09:16,103
I hurt! Need energy.

913
01:09:19,343 --> 01:09:20,623
Watch out!

914
01:09:23,863 --> 01:09:26,784
More energy!

915
01:09:35,424 --> 01:09:37,824
Geez, that's the grossest!
I'm gonna puke!

916
01:09:55,425 --> 01:09:58,505
There was this big guy and
this girl and this little kid.

917
01:09:58,665 --> 01:10:00,625
At least I thought it
was a little kid.

918
01:10:00,825 --> 01:10:04,865
Then I flashed on reality right!
Halloween's not till next month.

919
01:10:05,025 --> 01:10:07,785
I know my rights.
Where's my baseball cap?

920
01:10:07,865 --> 01:10:09,706
- Shut up!
- Bastards!

921
01:10:13,386 --> 01:10:15,146
Can't move!

922
01:10:16,746 --> 01:10:18,786
Philsey?

923
01:10:19,426 --> 01:10:21,746
Philsey?

924
01:10:25,226 --> 01:10:28,426
Philsey! It's me.

925
01:10:30,826 --> 01:10:32,867
Howard.

926
01:10:41,147 --> 01:10:44,507
Howard, I got arrested at the plant.
I'm gonna have a criminal record.

927
01:10:45,147 --> 01:10:46,787
Jenning kidnapped Beverly.

928
01:10:46,947 --> 01:10:48,827
He's taking her back
to that science lab.

929
01:10:48,947 --> 01:10:51,787
- What? Why?
- He's some kind of monster.

930
01:10:51,907 --> 01:10:54,988
He's gonna bring down more of
his buddies. He's got big plans.

931
01:10:55,148 --> 01:10:58,588
Like taking over Earth.
Philsey, we gotta get out of here.

932
01:10:58,708 --> 01:11:01,668
Howard, this door doesn't
have any handles...

933
01:11:01,828 --> 01:11:03,828
get a rock or something
and break this window.

934
01:11:03,948 --> 01:11:05,828
- A rock?
- Window.

935
01:11:07,468 --> 01:11:09,188
Let me try the door first.

936
01:11:12,908 --> 01:11:15,148
- How we getting out of here?
- Come on.

937
01:11:16,229 --> 01:11:18,109
Philsey, where we going?

938
01:11:22,469 --> 01:11:24,189
Hey, over here.

939
01:11:26,109 --> 01:11:30,149
- They're gonna be gone soon.
- Hey, let's steal a cop car.

940
01:11:30,269 --> 01:11:32,229
Don't you think that would
be a little conspicuous?

941
01:11:32,389 --> 01:11:35,149
- Hitchhike? Cab?
- What is that?

942
01:11:38,510 --> 01:11:40,270
Gezz! It looks like an airplane.

943
01:11:40,430 --> 01:11:42,590
Well, it will be. We can
put it together in no time.

944
01:11:42,710 --> 01:11:45,550
Somebody's weekend hobby's
gonna get back to that lab.

945
01:11:45,710 --> 01:11:47,790
Hey, we've got a saying
on my planet.

946
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:51,350
If God intended us to fly he
wouldn't have taken away our wings.

947
01:11:51,470 --> 01:11:53,870
That's really profound, Howard.
Could you find the tool box?

948
01:11:54,070 --> 01:11:56,310
Yeah, I know why
you want a tool box.

949
01:11:56,430 --> 01:11:57,990
You got a screw loose.

950
01:12:14,511 --> 01:12:18,471
- Power.
- No.

951
01:12:36,552 --> 01:12:37,992
They just spotted
the duck and the kid.

952
01:12:38,152 --> 01:12:39,752
- Where?
- Behind the warehouse next door.

953
01:12:39,912 --> 01:12:42,952
- They're about to take off.
- What do you mean "take off"?

954
01:12:43,752 --> 01:12:45,673
- It's not doing anything.
- Cops!

955
01:12:46,873 --> 01:12:49,393
- Push forward on the throttle.
- Okay, yeah.

956
01:12:49,553 --> 01:12:51,353
Full throttle!
Full throttle!

957
01:12:52,353 --> 01:12:54,473
- Cops, Philsey!
- One eighty, Howard.

958
01:12:54,633 --> 01:12:55,353
Right.

959
01:12:58,433 --> 01:13:00,073
One away!

960
01:13:01,713 --> 01:13:03,713
Come on! Hurry up!

961
01:13:04,433 --> 01:13:08,274
- There's cops everywhere.
- Not in the air, Howard! Up, up!

962
01:13:09,234 --> 01:13:10,874
Look out!

963
01:13:12,834 --> 01:13:15,274
Prepare for a take-off.

964
01:13:23,314 --> 01:13:25,354
No, no!

965
01:13:31,275 --> 01:13:34,035
Follow them! Bring them
down and bring them back!

966
01:13:36,275 --> 01:13:40,115
I want that duck!
Dead or alive!

967
01:13:40,275 --> 01:13:42,795
- South, Southwest, Howard.
- What?

968
01:13:43,955 --> 01:13:46,395
That way. Stay low!

969
01:13:46,515 --> 01:13:50,195
Beverly, I'm coming
to get you, sweetheart.

970
01:14:13,437 --> 01:14:17,957
Help me! Help! Somebody help me!
Please, help me!

971
01:14:18,117 --> 01:14:19,077
Please watch your step.

972
01:14:19,237 --> 01:14:20,517
I think you're all gonna
find this very interesting.

973
01:14:20,637 --> 01:14:22,637
You know, honestly, Congressman
this Three Mile Islands China...

974
01:14:22,757 --> 01:14:24,997
Syndrome melt down stuff.
It's all history.

975
01:14:25,117 --> 01:14:26,077
The only melt downs
around here...

976
01:14:26,197 --> 01:14:28,237
are the cheese sandwiches
in the toaster oven.

977
01:14:33,717 --> 01:14:37,118
These Washington guys take
a real beating on these junkets.

978
01:14:37,278 --> 01:14:43,238
Our nuclear reactor is pumping
out one million kilowatts of power.

979
01:14:43,358 --> 01:14:49,958
One million kilowatts of power?

980
01:14:50,118 --> 01:14:54,158
Yes, sir. Listen, I think
we could all use cup of coffee.

981
01:14:54,518 --> 01:14:58,199
Help! Somebody help me,
please! Help!

982
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:41,120
Come on! Go, go, go, go!

983
01:15:52,921 --> 01:15:55,721
I feel much better.

984
01:16:00,841 --> 01:16:03,842
What's that? Right pedal!
Right pedal!

985
01:16:06,282 --> 01:16:08,842
- Damn it, that was too close!
- I'm just learning here!

986
01:16:08,962 --> 01:16:10,922
Howard, in pre-historic
times you flew.

987
01:16:11,002 --> 01:16:16,042
Fly, Howard! Find your instincts.
Trust your birdness. Fly!

988
01:16:31,563 --> 01:16:33,803
Howard, pull up! Pull up!

989
01:16:38,443 --> 01:16:40,403
- Touch down!
- Great landing, Howard...

990
01:16:40,523 --> 01:16:42,403
but this isn't gonna
get us to the lab.

991
01:16:42,563 --> 01:16:46,363
You said to follow my instincts.
This is my nesting instinct.

992
01:16:50,484 --> 01:16:54,204
- I'm flying, blind here.
- Shut up! You're not flying at all!

993
01:16:54,364 --> 01:16:56,884
- Let her rip!
- Bombs away!

994
01:17:01,884 --> 01:17:04,244
Pull it up, Howard,
were running outta land!

995
01:17:04,324 --> 01:17:06,684
- Wet stuff ahead!
- Watch out!

996
01:17:32,486 --> 01:17:35,286
Death from the skies
to all duck, Hunters!

997
01:17:36,606 --> 01:17:38,166
Toro, toro, toro!

998
01:17:39,086 --> 01:17:41,046
Vengeance is mine! Yeah!

999
01:17:43,326 --> 01:17:44,686
Bonzai!

1000
01:17:59,287 --> 01:18:01,567
Slow down.
Slow down.

1001
01:18:01,807 --> 01:18:03,847
Hey, you, pull over here!

1002
01:18:14,527 --> 01:18:16,728
This is a smog
device inspection.

1003
01:18:18,848 --> 01:18:21,928
- And I need... Shut off the engine!
- It is off! Somebody's pushing!

1004
01:18:27,088 --> 01:18:31,008
Shut it down! Shut it down!
What the hell is wrong with you?

1005
01:18:31,728 --> 01:18:38,849
- I wanna see your license, Jack!
- I have no license, I am not Jack.

1006
01:19:17,090 --> 01:19:20,570
Smog inspection!

1007
01:19:28,851 --> 01:19:30,691
What happened?

1008
01:19:33,011 --> 01:19:34,931
We gotta get outta here!

1009
01:19:39,251 --> 01:19:43,291
- Damage report, Philsey?
- Fuel hose is busted!

1010
01:19:43,611 --> 01:19:48,012
Rudder is wasted. Basically,
we're dying here, Howard.

1011
01:19:50,572 --> 01:19:52,572
- I'm bailing out!
- No, you're not!

1012
01:19:52,732 --> 01:19:55,972
You're gonna get up there
and fix this lawn mower now!

1013
01:20:05,132 --> 01:20:07,693
- Philsey, how's it going?
- I'm getting close.

1014
01:20:07,813 --> 01:20:09,613
- I'm on top of it!
- Good.

1015
01:20:14,013 --> 01:20:16,773
Relax, Howard, I almost got it!

1016
01:20:30,214 --> 01:20:34,894
Philsey, I did a loop the loop.
I'm getting good at this! I...

1017
01:20:36,934 --> 01:20:39,014
Howard!

1018
01:20:39,494 --> 01:20:41,054
Stop, Howard!

1019
01:20:43,094 --> 01:20:45,614
Geez, I thought I lost you.

1020
01:20:46,974 --> 01:20:49,774
Philsey, this is no time
for water sports.

1021
01:20:50,334 --> 01:20:52,215
I'm just kidding, big guy.

1022
01:21:05,415 --> 01:21:07,055
Hey, scum, lemme go!

1023
01:21:17,976 --> 01:21:22,696
- Philsey, get back up here!
- I'm trying!

1024
01:21:22,856 --> 01:21:25,576
No, no, don't shoot!
I'm an innocent hostage!

1025
01:21:25,736 --> 01:21:27,896
- The duck's a lunatic!
- What?

1026
01:21:28,056 --> 01:21:31,616
He's a duck terrorist!
He hijacked the plane!

1027
01:21:34,816 --> 01:21:36,417
Howard, pull it back!

1028
01:21:43,577 --> 01:21:47,137
- Welcome back, Philsey!
- Thanks, it's great to be back.

1029
01:21:49,897 --> 01:21:51,777
Will you watch
the road, damn it?

1030
01:21:51,897 --> 01:21:54,337
Hey, it's just another car.
It's no big deal!

1031
01:21:54,857 --> 01:21:57,257
- Yes, big deal! Big...
- What?

1032
01:21:57,417 --> 01:21:59,778
Big, big, big...

1033
01:22:05,458 --> 01:22:08,058
- No wings.
- Welcome to the club.

1034
01:22:08,458 --> 01:22:09,978
Coming through!

1035
01:22:16,258 --> 01:22:18,418
That's a lotta fun.
I'd like to get off now.

1036
01:22:19,018 --> 01:22:23,259
Slow down.
Slow down!

1037
01:22:23,419 --> 01:22:26,179
Relax, I'll just throttle
this baby back.

1038
01:22:28,459 --> 01:22:30,779
- Philsey! I better tell you now.
- What?

1039
01:22:30,899 --> 01:22:32,459
I can't swim!

1040
01:22:39,499 --> 01:22:42,700
Philsey, help!
Philsey, help me!

1041
01:22:43,460 --> 01:22:45,540
Never heard of a duck
that couldn't swim.

1042
01:22:45,700 --> 01:22:49,300
- Shut up and save me!
- We've been through hell!

1043
01:22:49,420 --> 01:22:53,540
Now, I there is some kind of monster
in here. Howard this crazy!

1044
01:22:53,700 --> 01:22:58,940
Phil, no duck is an island and
if fate sent me here to save her.

1045
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:01,940
Then, I wonder that duck
is ready to fight.

1046
01:23:04,581 --> 01:23:06,221
Damn!

1047
01:23:16,021 --> 01:23:18,021
He's starting
the spectra-scope.

1048
01:23:18,141 --> 01:23:21,301
Gezz, he's gonna bring down
another Dark Over Lord.

1049
01:23:21,421 --> 01:23:24,581
- We gotta get Beverly outta there.
- Hey, take it easy, Conan.

1050
01:23:24,701 --> 01:23:28,062
What are you gonna fight him with?
We gotta find some kind of... Wait!

1051
01:23:28,222 --> 01:23:31,782
Carter showed me something here once
that might do it, if we can find it!

1052
01:23:33,102 --> 01:23:34,822
You'll never get away with this!

1053
01:23:36,822 --> 01:23:39,862
We'll find it! Come on, Philsey!

1054
01:23:41,142 --> 01:23:43,102
You don't scare me!

1055
01:23:50,943 --> 01:23:55,663
Boy, the Defense Research. This
is it! This is it! This is locked!

1056
01:24:05,543 --> 01:24:08,903
Okay, I know where it is.
It's on the right or the left or...

1057
01:24:09,983 --> 01:24:13,304
There it is.
The Neutron Disintegrator.

1058
01:24:16,304 --> 01:24:19,784
- And a big lock.
- Rats!

1059
01:24:21,064 --> 01:24:25,384
Okay, all right. Turn me
into a Dark Over Lord...

1060
01:24:25,584 --> 01:24:28,024
I'll still spit in
your wormy face!

1061
01:24:32,024 --> 01:24:36,145
Welcome to Dyna-Technics.
Authorized personnel only.

1062
01:24:36,385 --> 01:24:42,145
Please insert Code Key. Authorized
personnel only, thank you.

1063
01:24:42,265 --> 01:24:46,905
Hello, Dr. Jenning. Please select
your target an enter target course.

1064
01:24:48,865 --> 01:24:53,905
Thank you. Laser Spectra-scope is
now targeting the Nexus of Sominus.

1065
01:24:54,105 --> 01:24:55,826
Targeting is in process.

1066
01:25:04,626 --> 01:25:08,506
Come on, Philsey!
Hit it harder! Way to go!

1067
01:25:09,906 --> 01:25:12,106
- Hurry up!
- The Neutron Disintegrator...

1068
01:25:12,186 --> 01:25:14,546
was developed for the Army
until he cost overance became...

1069
01:25:14,666 --> 01:25:16,426
- really embarrassing to the...
- Can it stop Jenning?

1070
01:25:16,546 --> 01:25:18,987
Theoretically, yes, unfortunately
it's never been tested.

1071
01:25:22,867 --> 01:25:26,547
Attention, all personnel,
please, leave the station...

1072
01:25:26,667 --> 01:25:28,907
while laser doors are opening.

1073
01:25:30,827 --> 01:25:33,987
Please, leave machine
while spectra-scope extension.

1074
01:25:37,627 --> 01:25:41,828
Target is now locked.
Target is now locked.

1075
01:25:45,188 --> 01:25:47,468
Is this like a stick-shift
or automatic?

1076
01:25:47,628 --> 01:25:51,268
Well, Howard, you have to get into
firing range without him seeing you!

1077
01:25:51,428 --> 01:25:55,148
Right. I'll sneak up on him
and then I'll blast him!

1078
01:25:55,268 --> 01:25:57,828
Do you wish to bring
the laser to full power?

1079
01:25:57,948 --> 01:25:59,428
Dr. Jenning, I repeat...

1080
01:25:59,628 --> 01:26:02,509
do you wish to bring
the laser to full power?

1081
01:26:03,549 --> 01:26:04,829
Thank you.

1082
01:26:06,869 --> 01:26:09,869
- What's this do?
- No, Howard, don't...

1083
01:26:13,109 --> 01:26:14,549
Howard!

1084
01:26:17,789 --> 01:26:21,829
- You're in big trouble now!
- Shut up!

1085
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:38,550
Run, Howard!
He's in a bad mood!

1086
01:26:41,670 --> 01:26:44,710
Come on, Philsey, move!
Let's crank her up!

1087
01:26:46,871 --> 01:26:48,231
- Hurry!
- Where's that button?

1088
01:26:48,511 --> 01:26:50,111
It won't start!

1089
01:26:51,991 --> 01:26:52,911
Oh, my God!

1090
01:26:55,631 --> 01:26:58,191
- Watch out!
- Jump, Howard!

1091
01:26:58,311 --> 01:26:59,951
- This is our only chance!
- Get outta there.

1092
01:27:00,071 --> 01:27:02,551
- Duck!
- And proud of it!

1093
01:27:32,913 --> 01:27:37,113
Philsey, you saved my life!
Are you all right?

1094
01:27:37,473 --> 01:27:40,753
- Terrific, Howard.
- It still won't start!

1095
01:27:40,913 --> 01:27:43,913
- Try the seat belt, Howard.
- Seat belt?

1096
01:27:48,793 --> 01:27:50,393
Whatsabe misua.

1097
01:27:52,474 --> 01:27:55,954
You little pond hopper.

1098
01:28:07,714 --> 01:28:10,234
Go, Howard, go!

1099
01:28:18,235 --> 01:28:20,555
Talk about bad breath!

1100
01:28:23,995 --> 01:28:26,115
Turn off the eyes!

1101
01:28:45,276 --> 01:28:47,716
Now it's my turn.

1102
01:29:05,757 --> 01:29:08,917
Dark Over Lord, I want you!

1103
01:29:18,717 --> 01:29:21,318
Prepare to eat beak!

1104
01:29:35,678 --> 01:29:37,318
So long sucker!

1105
01:29:41,358 --> 01:29:43,039
Howard!

1106
01:29:57,159 --> 01:29:58,519
No!

1107
01:30:03,559 --> 01:30:05,000
Howard?

1108
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:11,360
Howard?

1109
01:30:16,200 --> 01:30:19,000
- Oh, boy!
- Howard?

1110
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:28,801
- Howard!
- You all right?

1111
01:30:29,201 --> 01:30:31,841
I need this like
I need another tail!

1112
01:30:31,961 --> 01:30:34,601
- You did it!
- Get me down from here!

1113
01:30:34,721 --> 01:30:35,921
Come on!

1114
01:30:41,441 --> 01:30:44,441
- Dr. Jenning?
- Howard, it's not...

1115
01:30:44,641 --> 01:30:45,401
It's not what?

1116
01:30:45,561 --> 01:30:46,881
The devil's not
inside me any more.

1117
01:30:47,041 --> 01:30:49,042
The explosion must have
released it and it's loose!

1118
01:30:49,202 --> 01:30:51,762
- What about me?
- The Dark Over Lord is still here.

1119
01:30:51,882 --> 01:30:55,802
Well then, I suggest we get Beverly
and get the hell outta here!

1120
01:30:57,922 --> 01:30:59,842
Philsey, get her
down from there!

1121
01:31:01,762 --> 01:31:04,282
- What took you so long?
- Nothing. Just got arrested...

1122
01:31:04,482 --> 01:31:07,842
shot at, handcuffed,
I got thrown out of an airplane!

1123
01:31:09,442 --> 01:31:10,682
Guys?

1124
01:31:10,883 --> 01:31:12,803
His tongue with
a cigarette lighter!

1125
01:31:12,923 --> 01:31:14,523
Cigarette lighter?
That's really disgusting!

1126
01:31:14,643 --> 01:31:16,283
- Guys?
- What?

1127
01:31:37,044 --> 01:31:38,764
Oh, my God!

1128
01:31:53,044 --> 01:31:54,724
Phil, Phil.
Get up! Get up!

1129
01:31:54,884 --> 01:31:56,885
- It's coming!
- It's coming! I was just resting.

1130
01:31:57,005 --> 01:31:58,165
Look!

1131
01:32:20,726 --> 01:32:23,326
Good boy, stay back! Stay back.
Oh, boy!

1132
01:32:25,366 --> 01:32:27,686
Howard!

1133
01:32:27,846 --> 01:32:29,886
There goes Howard!
We've gotta help Howard, Phill!

1134
01:32:29,926 --> 01:32:32,166
What?
Yeah, gotta help Howard!

1135
01:32:33,086 --> 01:32:34,806
- Come on. Howard!
- Here we go!

1136
01:32:40,687 --> 01:32:46,967
- Going somewhere, Howard?
- No!

1137
01:32:48,687 --> 01:32:55,567
- There's no escape.
- Philsey! Dr. Jenning! Mother!

1138
01:33:04,808 --> 01:33:07,728
- Do you wish to active the laser?
- Yes.

1139
01:33:07,848 --> 01:33:09,128
Thank you, Dr. Jenning.

1140
01:33:09,288 --> 01:33:12,168
- He started the activation sequence.
- He's gonna bring down more of them.

1141
01:33:12,968 --> 01:33:15,008
You may fire when ready.

1142
01:33:19,688 --> 01:33:22,448
Four minutes to arrival.

1143
01:33:32,809 --> 01:33:36,849
Philsey, Beverly, anybody!
Help!

1144
01:33:36,969 --> 01:33:38,889
Three minutes, thirty seconds
to arrival.

1145
01:33:39,049 --> 01:33:40,729
Howard!
Here!

1146
01:33:42,249 --> 01:33:45,489
All right!
Like salami!

1147
01:33:51,810 --> 01:33:53,450
Did you lose something?

1148
01:33:56,010 --> 01:34:00,170
Alien specimens are arriving
laboratory in three minutes.

1149
01:34:07,971 --> 01:34:09,251
All right!

1150
01:34:32,052 --> 01:34:35,252
Eat claw, Duck!

1151
01:34:35,612 --> 01:34:41,532
- Two minutes to arrival.
- Belt, box, trigger!

1152
01:34:53,453 --> 01:34:55,853
One minute,
thirty seconds to arrival.

1153
01:34:56,013 --> 01:34:59,573
You little duck!

1154
01:35:22,094 --> 01:35:25,934
- One minute to arrival.
- Howard!

1155
01:35:28,534 --> 01:35:30,454
There's more coming down.

1156
01:35:34,014 --> 01:35:35,894
The machine, Howard.
You've got to destroy it!

1157
01:35:36,014 --> 01:35:38,055
- Blast it.
- Get them!

1158
01:35:38,215 --> 01:35:41,895
No, Howard, don't!
You'll never get home.

1159
01:35:42,015 --> 01:35:45,815
- Thirty seconds to arrival.
- Get them!

1160
01:35:53,095 --> 01:35:57,415
Goodbye, Duck World.
Get outta there. Run!

1161
01:35:57,735 --> 01:36:00,176
Ten seconds
and counting to arrival.

1162
01:36:00,296 --> 01:36:00,936
Over here!

1163
01:36:01,056 --> 01:36:08,856
Ten, nine, eight, seven,
six, five, four, three, two...

1164
01:36:09,016 --> 01:36:11,056
one, arrival.

1165
01:36:45,618 --> 01:36:46,818
Howard!

1166
01:36:59,258 --> 01:37:00,738
No!

1167
01:37:07,739 --> 01:37:14,259
I don't know where you are now,
but I hope you're happier there.

1168
01:37:18,619 --> 01:37:25,739
This world didn't threat you very
good, but you saved it, didn't you?

1169
01:37:32,940 --> 01:37:42,300
- Howard?
- I am not Howard anymore.

1170
01:37:49,060 --> 01:37:53,981
Geez, all this smoke,
it's murder on the sinuses.

1171
01:37:57,301 --> 01:37:59,221
Fooled you, didn't I?

1172
01:38:01,101 --> 01:38:05,261
- Howard.
- It's all right, Toots.

1173
01:38:16,782 --> 01:38:21,262
Well, all right, I'd like to dedicate
this song to our new manager.

1174
01:38:27,142 --> 01:38:27,942
Go!

1175
01:39:01,144 --> 01:39:03,824
All right, that's mechanical.
We're gonna release the big wave-0.

1176
01:39:03,944 --> 01:39:06,744
Cue as ready.
Cue and go!

1177
01:39:09,904 --> 01:39:10,984
- Howard, Howard.
- Yeah?

1178
01:39:11,104 --> 01:39:12,704
Help me out!
Release that rope there!

1179
01:39:12,824 --> 01:39:13,784
Gotcha.

1180
01:39:16,504 --> 01:39:20,225
- Not that one!
- Philsey, what's going on?

1181
01:39:20,345 --> 01:39:23,065
Get me down from here!
I've done enough flying.

1182
01:39:23,225 --> 01:39:24,105
Philsey!

1183
01:39:29,905 --> 01:39:35,985
Philsey, do you realize I could
have been killed up there?

1184
01:39:40,066 --> 01:39:42,546
- What's this?
- Rock and Roll!

1185
01:39:42,866 --> 01:39:45,706
Right!
Give me four.

1186
01:39:52,786 --> 01:39:54,826
Big, big, baby.

1187
01:39:56,986 --> 01:39:58,706
Is that hot enough for you?

1188
01:40:18,667 --> 01:40:20,947
Hit a purple "A" for you all.

1189
01:40:41,028 --> 01:40:41,948
Do it!

1190
01:40:52,829 --> 01:40:54,509
That's me!

1191
01:41:06,109 --> 01:41:09,110
Thank you! Thank you!
We love you.

1192
01:41:09,510 --> 01:41:13,270
Howard, Howard,
Howard, Howard!

1193
01:41:13,710 --> 01:41:15,950
We love you!

1194
01:41:19,750 --> 01:41:21,990
Not bad for a duck
from outer space.

1195
01:41:22,110 --> 01:41:24,070
You were great, Ducky.

1196
