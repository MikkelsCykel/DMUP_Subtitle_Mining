1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,291
You know, l ain't a churchgoing person...

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,660
...but, l swear,
that's gonna be a thing of a past.

3
00:00:08,698 --> 00:00:09,960
Let him be all right.

4
00:00:10,033 --> 00:00:14,732
l didn't hit him hard,
he should still have one good one left.

5
00:00:38,094 --> 00:00:39,493
Sweetie.

6
00:00:41,231 --> 00:00:42,596
Thank you, Lord.

7
00:00:55,245 --> 00:00:56,212
That's it.

8
00:01:10,327 --> 00:01:13,558
Excuse me, Officer. Can you tell me
where the Pink Cloud Motel is?

9
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:14,819
Yeah.

10
00:01:15,732 --> 00:01:19,759
Just hang a right out here.
Go down a little bit a ways. Can't miss it.

11
00:01:24,941 --> 00:01:28,536
How would you and your girlfriend, there,
like to race me over?

12
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,178
Come on, guys.

13
00:02:38,615 --> 00:02:39,604
Philo!

14
00:02:42,652 --> 00:02:44,415
All right, wise guy.

15
00:02:44,487 --> 00:02:46,614
-Which station?
-Fourth Street. Why?

16
00:02:46,689 --> 00:02:49,180
Fourth Street Station!

17
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:56,027
What is it, snookums?

18
00:02:56,766 --> 00:02:59,394
Somebody's bashed into our car,
honeybunch.

19
00:02:59,702 --> 00:03:03,638
We can always get another car.
Come back to bed, sweetheart.

20
00:03:13,149 --> 00:03:14,275
What's that for?

21
00:03:14,984 --> 00:03:16,110
Just in case.

22
00:03:25,261 --> 00:03:28,059
Take her home. Hurry on back.

23
00:03:36,272 --> 00:03:37,432
You wait here.

24
00:04:06,002 --> 00:04:07,128
Over this way.

25
00:04:15,745 --> 00:04:16,803
That's enough.

26
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:34,583
Thanks, old buddy.
That took guts. l owe you one.

27
00:05:46,436 --> 00:05:48,028
Don't even think about it.

28
00:05:55,979 --> 00:05:59,847
-How long has she been like this?
-All morning. Ain't said a word.

29
00:06:11,027 --> 00:06:13,222
l suppose you'll have to fight, now.

30
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,060
Yeah.

31
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,793
l don't think they're going to hurt her.
l think they just wanted you to fight.

32
00:06:22,305 --> 00:06:23,237
l know.

33
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,831
-Piece of crap, though.
-Yeah.

34
00:06:37,754 --> 00:06:39,688
She's getting on.

35
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:45,084
l think maybe her brains are, you know,
turning soft.

36
00:06:46,162 --> 00:06:48,460
Jelly, sonny. Jelly.

37
00:06:49,098 --> 00:06:52,659
''Jelly roll killed my mama

38
00:06:52,869 --> 00:06:57,272
''Drove my daddy stone blind''

39
00:06:58,141 --> 00:07:01,872
You're going to church next Sunday.
You, too.

40
00:07:08,818 --> 00:07:10,752
Philo. lt's him.

41
00:07:19,729 --> 00:07:20,525
Yeah?

42
00:07:20,797 --> 00:07:24,096
Jackson, Wyoming. Saturday, noon.

43
00:07:24,634 --> 00:07:26,067
Not until l talk to her.

44
00:07:26,202 --> 00:07:28,329
You are in no position to set conditions.

45
00:07:28,538 --> 00:07:29,527
You heard me.

46
00:07:33,776 --> 00:07:34,743
Nino.

47
00:07:40,983 --> 00:07:42,348
-Philo?
-<i>You ok</i>ay?

48
00:07:42,418 --> 00:07:44,750
l'm fine.
Don't fight, they don't dare hurt me.

49
00:07:44,821 --> 00:07:47,756
<i>l trust</i> y<i>ou're not so foolish</i>
a<i>s to believe th</i>a<i>t, Mr. Be</i>dd<i>oe.</i>

50
00:07:47,824 --> 00:07:48,916
No, l'm not.

51
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:52,654
Lynn, the fight's not your concern.
l'll have you out of there on Saturday.

52
00:07:52,962 --> 00:07:54,224
Philo, listen--

53
00:07:56,165 --> 00:07:57,655
We have a deal, Mr. Beddoe?

54
00:07:57,967 --> 00:08:00,936
You'll produce her Saturday noon,
before the fight, right?

55
00:08:02,538 --> 00:08:03,527
Deal.

56
00:08:04,807 --> 00:08:09,267
All right, boys. Belly up to the table.
Get yourself some hair there.

57
00:08:09,612 --> 00:08:13,844
Here. Paint on some eyebrows.
You look like a bunch of freaks.

58
00:08:15,618 --> 00:08:19,816
-You promised me a moustache.
-Cholla. You promised l could be a blond.

59
00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:21,618
l want to be a redhead.

60
00:08:21,691 --> 00:08:23,750
-Give me that brown one.
-l like brown.

61
00:08:28,664 --> 00:08:31,690
Cholla, why don't you tell him
to give me what l asked for?

62
00:08:35,138 --> 00:08:35,900
l love it.

63
00:08:40,476 --> 00:08:41,773
Nobody knows nothing.

64
00:08:41,844 --> 00:08:45,280
l checked everybody l know,
even the sleazies.

65
00:08:45,982 --> 00:08:48,576
They're probably holding her somewhere
near Jackson.

66
00:08:49,652 --> 00:08:51,313
We'll just do little scouting.

67
00:09:51,013 --> 00:09:52,002
Jesus.

68
00:09:52,849 --> 00:09:56,512
Why don't you just shut up
and start passing out them tickets, there.

69
00:09:57,386 --> 00:09:58,751
l ain't got the heart.

70
00:09:59,655 --> 00:10:01,145
You've got enough trouble.

71
00:10:02,058 --> 00:10:03,252
Wait a minute.

72
00:10:03,459 --> 00:10:06,326
You have to give us them tickets.
You have to.

73
00:10:06,562 --> 00:10:09,030
l mean, didn't you see us?
We're lawbreakers.

74
00:10:09,165 --> 00:10:11,065
l mean, we are totally despicable.

75
00:10:11,601 --> 00:10:14,092
We have earned them tickets.

76
00:10:14,837 --> 00:10:19,706
Son, you are a walking violation
of the laws of nature.

77
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:22,937
But we don't enforce them laws.

78
00:10:32,788 --> 00:10:33,777
Lord.

79
00:10:35,124 --> 00:10:38,525
You have given me these crosses to bear.

80
00:10:38,895 --> 00:10:40,385
l will carry them...

81
00:10:40,463 --> 00:10:44,331
...all the way from Jerusalem to Jackson,
whichever is closer.

82
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,726
But hear me, Lord.

83
00:10:45,801 --> 00:10:48,736
''Though l walk through the valley
of the shadow of death''

84
00:10:48,804 --> 00:10:54,037
l will chew on Philo Beddoe's ass
for my last supper.

85
00:11:21,504 --> 00:11:22,801
l lose.

86
00:11:44,527 --> 00:11:47,690
Excuse me, sir, there's a call for you.
Mr. Beekman.

87
00:11:49,899 --> 00:11:52,299
Hello, Beeky, it's your dime.

88
00:11:52,602 --> 00:11:56,265
Zack? l got a sporting event laid out
for this Saturday.

89
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:00,605
A fire-eater named Philo Beddoe.

90
00:12:01,243 --> 00:12:02,801
Against Jack Wilson.

91
00:12:02,912 --> 00:12:05,437
Philo Beddoe? Never heard of him.

92
00:12:05,982 --> 00:12:08,143
Melvin, can Beddoe whup Jack Wilson?

93
00:12:08,751 --> 00:12:12,551
Beddoe's good, real good,
but l'd have to give Wilson the edge.

94
00:12:12,755 --> 00:12:13,915
How big an edge?

95
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:18,388
lf it was my money, 7-to-5,
but 6-to-5 is a fair bet.

96
00:12:19,729 --> 00:12:22,289
l might be interested in 4-to-1 .

97
00:12:22,598 --> 00:12:23,826
Even money, Zack.

98
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,134
Well, l might go 3-to-1 .

99
00:12:26,202 --> 00:12:28,136
l've reserved your suite for you.

100
00:12:28,404 --> 00:12:29,632
l'll be there.

101
00:12:35,277 --> 00:12:37,438
You all saddle up. We're going on a trip.

102
00:12:39,982 --> 00:12:43,042
Jim Martin and his crew are coming in
from Kansas City.

103
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:49,150
We got contingents coming in
from Seattle, LA, Frisco.

104
00:12:49,792 --> 00:12:51,225
Any takers at 6-to-5?

105
00:12:52,361 --> 00:12:54,522
We got about $30,000.

106
00:12:55,464 --> 00:12:56,488
You know, Jim...

107
00:12:56,565 --> 00:12:59,363
...we may have to go 2-to-1
to pick up the action a bit.

108
00:12:59,435 --> 00:13:01,869
We'll get enough action at 8-to-5.

109
00:13:02,571 --> 00:13:03,560
All right.

110
00:13:03,806 --> 00:13:06,434
-l'll call up Boston and set up a lay off.
-No.

111
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:10,708
No. There's not going to be a lay off.

112
00:13:12,081 --> 00:13:13,070
Jim.

113
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:16,544
We could get a couple million dollars
on this fight.

114
00:13:16,786 --> 00:13:18,310
Wilson's not going to lose.

115
00:13:19,422 --> 00:13:23,483
lf we try any funny stuff,
they'll retire us to the Jersey Flats.

116
00:13:23,726 --> 00:13:27,093
No funny stuff. l'm telling you,
Wilson's going to take him.

117
00:13:30,032 --> 00:13:31,431
All we've got to do....

118
00:13:31,834 --> 00:13:36,771
We set up a little lay off.
We take a nice 6, 7out

119
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:39,706
We walk away with $200,000. No risk.

120
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:42,309
l'd rather walk away with $2 million.

121
00:13:45,414 --> 00:13:46,403
Yeah.

122
00:13:46,749 --> 00:13:49,741
All right, l'll go along.

123
00:13:49,819 --> 00:13:52,287
But if Wilson loses,
you better have snowshoes.

124
00:13:52,855 --> 00:13:56,188
Because north of the Arctic Circle
is the only place we'll be safe.

125
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:02,294
Welcome to Jackson, Mr. Wilson.
lt's a great honor to serve you.

126
00:14:02,832 --> 00:14:05,960
l'll take you up to your suite myself.
Here, let me take this.

127
00:14:09,438 --> 00:14:13,431
There are three parties in progress,
one of which started yesterday afternoon.

128
00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:17,843
lf there's anything you need, anything.
The hotel does allows pets in the room.

129
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,214
lf you understand my meaning.

130
00:14:20,816 --> 00:14:22,408
l don't keep pets.

131
00:14:29,492 --> 00:14:30,789
No pets, no booze.

132
00:14:31,594 --> 00:14:34,256
-l can read.
-And no parties.

133
00:14:35,297 --> 00:14:36,662
That's Aunt Hortense.

134
00:14:36,732 --> 00:14:39,997
The last party she was at
was Teddy Roosevelt's inauguration.

135
00:14:40,302 --> 00:14:43,635
-ls she your aunt by blood or marriage?
-Blood.

136
00:14:44,373 --> 00:14:47,103
l'd be careful about having any children
if l were you.

137
00:14:48,944 --> 00:14:49,933
Always am.

138
00:15:03,292 --> 00:15:06,523
That's the fifteenth private jet
this morning. What's going on?

139
00:15:06,595 --> 00:15:07,789
Bare-knuckle fight.

140
00:15:08,164 --> 00:15:12,123
California boy named Philo Beddoe's taking
on some monster from the East Coast.

141
00:15:12,701 --> 00:15:15,602
-l ain't seen anything in the papers.
-Strictly illegal.

142
00:15:15,971 --> 00:15:19,634
No referee, and the fight won't end
until one or the other's half dead.

143
00:15:23,712 --> 00:15:24,906
Oh, my God.

144
00:15:31,053 --> 00:15:35,114
-l think l'm doing something wrong.
-You're doing just fine, hon.

145
00:15:35,858 --> 00:15:38,952
But we've been flying upside down
for 15 minutes, Zack.

146
00:15:39,028 --> 00:15:43,556
lt takes a little time to get the hang of it.
Don't be so hard on yourself, hon.

147
00:15:46,435 --> 00:15:49,097
Like the ride at the fair
where everything falls out.

148
00:15:49,171 --> 00:15:52,197
-l hope so.
-You're terrible.

149
00:15:52,274 --> 00:15:55,209
-You can't drink upside down.
-Sure, you can.

150
00:15:56,946 --> 00:15:58,641
-Here, try it.
-All right.

151
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,248
lt worked.

152
00:16:02,318 --> 00:16:04,684
You'd be surprised
what you can do upside down.

153
00:16:04,753 --> 00:16:05,742
Surprise me.

154
00:16:09,825 --> 00:16:12,555
l'll take the south side of town.
You take the north.

155
00:16:12,828 --> 00:16:15,092
-What are we looking for?
-l don't know.

156
00:16:15,164 --> 00:16:19,601
Keep your eyes out for anything peculiar.
And keep Aunt Hortense out of sight.

157
00:16:41,891 --> 00:16:43,688
Why, you're Philo Beddoe.

158
00:16:44,059 --> 00:16:45,959
-Yes, ma'am.
-lt's him!

159
00:16:46,161 --> 00:16:50,393
-He's looking too good.
-Too good by half.

160
00:16:51,033 --> 00:16:52,193
Excuse me, ma'am.

161
00:16:52,468 --> 00:16:55,198
We can't get decent odds on you
looking that good.

162
00:16:55,404 --> 00:16:58,669
We're trying to find some fool
who will give us 2-to-1 .

163
00:16:58,741 --> 00:17:00,971
Try to look a little more peaky, would you?

164
00:17:02,311 --> 00:17:03,300
Excuse me.

165
00:17:26,335 --> 00:17:28,166
-Sorry.
-You damn fool!

166
00:17:28,237 --> 00:17:30,262
-Let me see that hand.
-What?

167
00:17:30,339 --> 00:17:31,636
Wiggle your fingers.

168
00:17:33,509 --> 00:17:36,842
You could have broken that hand
and made paupers out of all of us.

169
00:17:37,746 --> 00:17:38,713
Sorry.

170
00:17:39,181 --> 00:17:42,480
What are you standing here gabbing for?
Get on back to jogging.

171
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:45,784
-l think l might do that.
-Wait.

172
00:17:46,221 --> 00:17:49,554
No booze, no parties. ln bed by 8:00 p.m.

173
00:17:50,392 --> 00:17:51,825
You can count on that.

174
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:55,619
l do.

175
00:17:57,099 --> 00:17:58,589
Did you all see that?

176
00:17:58,667 --> 00:18:02,728
The way he grabbed me with one hand
like l was a feather?

177
00:18:04,306 --> 00:18:07,469
Son of a gun, boys, we're going to be rich.

178
00:18:08,344 --> 00:18:10,335
We're already rich, Zack.

179
00:18:17,453 --> 00:18:18,920
Mind if l jog with you?

180
00:18:20,022 --> 00:18:22,149
You work for some pretty strange folks.

181
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,986
Who l work for is my business.

182
00:18:25,995 --> 00:18:27,155
They got my girl.

183
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,759
They're running together.

184
00:18:31,567 --> 00:18:33,034
Talk about beef on a hook.

185
00:18:35,938 --> 00:18:38,236
-l got $40 on Beddoe.
-You're on.

186
00:18:38,941 --> 00:18:40,135
l didn't know.

187
00:18:40,275 --> 00:18:43,870
l didn't say you did. l just said
you worked for some strange folks.

188
00:18:43,946 --> 00:18:45,811
Well, their business isn't mine.

189
00:18:46,949 --> 00:18:48,211
l never said it was.

190
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:52,553
We're even, remember?

191
00:18:59,728 --> 00:19:00,717
Jim.

192
00:19:01,296 --> 00:19:02,888
Tony Paoli's on the way up.

193
00:19:04,867 --> 00:19:09,031
-Poor little Tony, he never learns.
-Not junior, senior.

194
00:19:09,471 --> 00:19:11,029
-Big Tony?
-Big Tony.

195
00:19:11,607 --> 00:19:13,336
What is he coming here for?

196
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:33,055
Mr. Paoli. What a pleasure to see you.

197
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:44,104
l hear you ain't laying off any of the action.

198
00:19:44,573 --> 00:19:46,598
Not so far, no, sir.

199
00:19:48,277 --> 00:19:51,542
You got guts. l admire a man with guts.

200
00:19:54,716 --> 00:19:58,846
So l says, ''Big Tony,
maybe now's the time you go out...

201
00:19:58,921 --> 00:20:02,379
''...and make a little bet with this
high-roller Beekman with guts.''

202
00:20:09,565 --> 00:20:10,998
$100,000?

203
00:20:12,434 --> 00:20:13,423
Mr. Beekman.

204
00:20:13,836 --> 00:20:17,465
You and l are not men
who deal in five zeroes.

205
00:20:19,074 --> 00:20:22,805
-He means six zeroes, Jim.
-''He means six zeroes, Jim.''

206
00:20:24,713 --> 00:20:27,147
Of course, l have to cover it.

207
00:20:28,417 --> 00:20:29,406
Of course.

208
00:20:58,947 --> 00:21:01,177
Give us a look, sweetie.
Come on, honeybunch.

209
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,218
Show us those big blue eyes.

210
00:21:17,432 --> 00:21:19,764
He's a menace.
Goes around peeking in windows.

211
00:21:19,835 --> 00:21:23,737
Ogled at me last night while l was
getting it on with two young beauties.

212
00:21:24,606 --> 00:21:26,733
Clyde has no interest in human sex.

213
00:21:26,808 --> 00:21:29,641
What were you doing,
getting it on with a couple of apes?

214
00:21:29,711 --> 00:21:31,440
Get out. Out.

215
00:21:33,682 --> 00:21:34,671
Let's go.

216
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,718
-The fight ain't on till noon.
-l know that.

217
00:21:36,785 --> 00:21:40,585
l found where they're holding Lynn.
Best to hit them when they move her.

218
00:21:40,656 --> 00:21:42,988
-What's going on?
-He found out where Lynn is.

219
00:21:43,225 --> 00:21:44,249
Let's go.

220
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,292
l know they're packing heat
and they might use it.

221
00:21:47,629 --> 00:21:50,154
l'm his friend and Clyde's his friend.
We go.

222
00:21:54,469 --> 00:21:55,265
Hop in there, kid.

223
00:22:25,968 --> 00:22:27,128
Right turn, Clyde.

224
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,603
-You all right?
-l'm fine.

225
00:22:33,976 --> 00:22:36,240
Why don't you get the cops
and the ambulance?

226
00:22:36,311 --> 00:22:39,940
-The cops ain't part of the bargain.
-All right, just the ambulance, then.

227
00:22:40,449 --> 00:22:41,780
That bullet was mine.

228
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:44,541
l like being a hero, too,
sometimes, you know.

229
00:22:44,753 --> 00:22:46,812
Well, you're doing a good job with it.

230
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:51,054
Look, l just saved you guys' asses
from the slammer.

231
00:22:51,727 --> 00:22:53,285
So now they belong to me.

232
00:22:54,029 --> 00:22:56,930
But if l ever see you again,
l'll come and collect them.

233
00:22:57,099 --> 00:23:02,059
You just get in this car and
keep driving west, until you see the surf.

234
00:23:02,504 --> 00:23:04,597
Got it? Move.

235
00:23:07,175 --> 00:23:10,110
-l owe you one.
-No, we're even.

236
00:23:10,646 --> 00:23:13,479
Your hairy friend back there
saved my skin for me.

237
00:23:14,249 --> 00:23:17,946
-We're even, then.
-You're not going to fight, are you?

238
00:23:18,553 --> 00:23:20,487
Well, if l don't, it's a forfeit.

239
00:23:20,656 --> 00:23:23,489
A lot of people bet money on me.
Not all of them are rich.

240
00:23:23,558 --> 00:23:26,789
lf neither one of us showed up,
then there wouldn't be any fight.

241
00:23:26,962 --> 00:23:28,589
Then all the bets would be off.

242
00:23:29,998 --> 00:23:31,829
That's something to think about.

243
00:23:32,734 --> 00:23:35,202
Wilson! He hung up.

244
00:23:35,971 --> 00:23:37,802
Well, that's it.

245
00:23:38,707 --> 00:23:40,698
Neither of them are going to show.

246
00:23:40,776 --> 00:23:43,176
-All the bets are off, then.
-Damn it.

247
00:23:43,378 --> 00:23:46,814
l spent a lot of time,
a lot of money setting this thing up.

248
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:52,482
Well, you better let
the sporting folks know.

249
00:23:53,822 --> 00:23:57,087
-Are you going to fight?
-l don't know. That depends on Wilson.

250
00:23:57,426 --> 00:23:59,121
You want to stay with Orville?

251
00:23:59,194 --> 00:24:02,595
On your way out, could you kind of
tell the nurses what a hero l am?

252
00:24:03,732 --> 00:24:06,064
-Why didn't l think of that?
-ls that the hero?

253
00:24:06,134 --> 00:24:07,897
That's him lying right there.

254
00:24:10,172 --> 00:24:12,140
You're a good man, Philo Beddoe.

255
00:24:12,441 --> 00:24:13,772
That hurts right here.

256
00:24:18,747 --> 00:24:21,739
-Young man's got a real healthy appetite.
-That he does.

257
00:24:24,353 --> 00:24:26,480
l don't think we can end it even.

258
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:30,016
l don't think.

259
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,418
But then, on the other hand...

260
00:24:33,495 --> 00:24:36,328
...l don't have any great desire
to make Beekman rich.

261
00:24:38,667 --> 00:24:39,861
Did you figure you would?

262
00:24:41,103 --> 00:24:42,092
l figure.

263
00:24:44,239 --> 00:24:47,606
But then, l guess we'll just have to find out
if l would have or not.

264
00:24:49,511 --> 00:24:50,500
l guess.

265
00:24:56,118 --> 00:24:57,312
Real shame.

266
00:24:58,553 --> 00:25:02,421
-lt would've been the fight of the century.
-Sure as hell would have.

267
00:25:09,364 --> 00:25:12,299
l blew a $100,000 deal to get out here
for this fight.

268
00:25:12,501 --> 00:25:14,366
Hell, it would have been worth it.

269
00:25:17,806 --> 00:25:19,831
Wilson would have taken him.

270
00:25:20,575 --> 00:25:22,941
-The hell he would have.
-Who cares?

271
00:25:54,443 --> 00:25:55,432
Get up there.

272
00:26:21,236 --> 00:26:22,635
Look at this.

273
00:26:23,805 --> 00:26:24,794
What?

274
00:26:26,675 --> 00:26:27,664
Let me see.

275
00:26:35,417 --> 00:26:37,681
All right, you kids,
what are you doing here?

276
00:26:39,087 --> 00:26:43,148
l said, what are you kids doing here?
Come on. Move back.

277
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:52,764
lt's on.

278
00:26:54,469 --> 00:26:55,458
The fight.

279
00:26:56,771 --> 00:27:01,902
Jackson Base, this is Car 2.
The fight is on. Here.

280
00:27:03,211 --> 00:27:06,044
Breaker, 1-9.
This is your good news channel.

281
00:27:06,381 --> 00:27:08,246
<i>lt's on! The fi</i>g<i>ht is on!</i>

282
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:09,812
Did you hear that?

283
00:27:11,686 --> 00:27:14,018
What are you waiting for, dummy?

284
00:27:17,526 --> 00:27:19,585
Aren't you going to have any? Come on.

285
00:27:23,098 --> 00:27:24,087
Yeah?

286
00:27:26,868 --> 00:27:29,996
-Jim, the fight is on. They're fighting!
-What time is it?

287
00:27:30,906 --> 00:27:33,932
-1 1 :50.
-All bets don't cancel until noon.

288
00:27:34,009 --> 00:27:37,672
That means all bets are still on.
Come on, lets go!

289
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:52,348
lt's on!

290
00:27:52,694 --> 00:27:54,161
-What?
-The fight.

291
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,547
lt's on. The fight's on!

292
00:28:19,788 --> 00:28:23,485
Hey, Cholla. What are we doing on foot?

293
00:28:23,825 --> 00:28:27,420
-l told you. The cops pinched the bikes.
-Yeah, but what for?

294
00:28:27,929 --> 00:28:30,124
Who's head of this outfit anyway,
you or me?

295
00:28:35,937 --> 00:28:36,926
Fighting?

296
00:29:10,605 --> 00:29:11,594
Come on.

297
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:32,489
lt's right around the corner,
and we'll be ringside, boys.

298
00:31:10,792 --> 00:31:11,781
Come on!

299
00:31:16,598 --> 00:31:17,587
Come on!

300
00:31:24,105 --> 00:31:26,903
Kill him. You heard me. Right now.

301
00:31:39,254 --> 00:31:42,052
Listen up.
That's Beekman's hoods up there.

302
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:43,623
They're gonna kill Beddoe.

303
00:31:43,691 --> 00:31:46,023
Cholla, that's great.
Let's give them a hand.

304
00:31:46,094 --> 00:31:47,026
You twit!

305
00:31:47,095 --> 00:31:50,189
l sold all our bikes and put
everything we had on Beddoe to win!

306
00:31:50,532 --> 00:31:51,897
Cholla, how could you?

307
00:31:51,966 --> 00:31:54,127
We been at war with Beddoe
for over a year.

308
00:31:54,202 --> 00:31:56,796
War is war, but business is business.

309
00:31:57,105 --> 00:31:59,665
lf Beddoe losses, we are flat busted.

310
00:32:00,208 --> 00:32:02,301
Hell, yeah, business is business.

311
00:32:02,577 --> 00:32:04,909
Don't you stand there, you freaks,
go get them!

312
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,835
We could end it here, you know.

313
00:33:41,976 --> 00:33:42,840
Even?

314
00:33:44,045 --> 00:33:45,535
No, you owe me one.

315
00:33:50,785 --> 00:33:52,980
-Hey, is it over?
-l don't know.

316
00:33:56,925 --> 00:34:00,019
Think l'd buy that while l'm still standing?

317
00:34:00,895 --> 00:34:01,827
No.

318
00:34:54,515 --> 00:34:55,504
lt's broke.

319
00:34:59,787 --> 00:35:00,776
That's it.

320
00:35:02,223 --> 00:35:04,248
-No, it ain't.
-That's it.

321
00:35:07,295 --> 00:35:09,991
-His arm's broke.
-Philo broke his arm.

322
00:35:17,238 --> 00:35:19,968
Stop this. lt doesn't matter.

323
00:35:20,875 --> 00:35:23,241
-lt matters to me.
-Beddoe.

324
00:35:24,846 --> 00:35:25,835
We're even.

325
00:35:34,022 --> 00:35:35,011
l owe you.

326
00:35:48,002 --> 00:35:50,630
Come on. Put that spaghetti down.

327
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,613
l knew he would do it.

328
00:37:11,185 --> 00:37:12,675
You get your money's worth.

329
00:37:25,633 --> 00:37:28,261
-Was l out?
-Yeah.

330
00:37:29,036 --> 00:37:31,504
-How long?
-Long enough.

331
00:37:35,643 --> 00:37:36,769
That's it, then.

332
00:37:38,012 --> 00:37:38,979
That's it.

333
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:50,352
-That was one hell of a fight.
-Better get that arm fixed.

334
00:37:59,267 --> 00:38:02,134
-l think we better get out of here.
-You're right.

335
00:38:17,885 --> 00:38:20,285
He's paying off 30 cents on the dollar.

336
00:38:20,588 --> 00:38:24,046
But he offered us 40 cents
if we promised not to touch him.

337
00:38:30,765 --> 00:38:32,858
-Did you promise?
-Of course.

338
00:38:34,101 --> 00:38:35,329
Good.

339
00:38:36,537 --> 00:38:39,563
Now go back there and kill him.

340
00:38:41,976 --> 00:38:46,379
Hell, Zack, 30 cents on the dollar
isn't gonna pay for the cost of that plane.

341
00:38:46,881 --> 00:38:48,075
lt don't matter.

342
00:38:48,149 --> 00:38:51,550
lt's worth it to pay for the privilege
of seeing a fight like that.

343
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,912
Sure as hell is.

344
00:38:54,622 --> 00:38:56,214
l should say.

345
00:38:57,858 --> 00:39:00,759
l'm gonna have to call you
on your bloomers, ma'am.

346
00:39:01,062 --> 00:39:04,623
Oh, damn it. Chivalry ain't dead in Texas.

347
00:39:05,166 --> 00:39:06,497
Thank you, ma'am.

348
00:39:17,144 --> 00:39:19,408
-What's the matter, who is it?
-Tony's boys.

349
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,380
What are they coming here for?

350
00:39:21,549 --> 00:39:24,541
-What the hell do you think for?
-Yeah, but they promised.

351
00:39:43,904 --> 00:39:44,893
Come on.

352
00:39:46,407 --> 00:39:49,433
Hurry up. Grab the case. Come on.

353
00:39:53,714 --> 00:39:57,980
Hey, Beekman, l believe you owe us
another 70 cents on the dollar.

354
00:39:58,185 --> 00:40:00,312
Come on, get out of the way, you punks.

355
00:40:00,621 --> 00:40:04,717
You really don't know who we are, do you?
Tell him who we are.

356
00:40:04,925 --> 00:40:08,156
We are the Black Widows.
We are feared throughout the land.

357
00:40:11,132 --> 00:40:13,066
-Jim.
-Let's get the hell out of here!

358
00:40:17,405 --> 00:40:20,966
You see how they lit out of here
when they found out who we were?

359
00:40:21,542 --> 00:40:23,669
Didn't l tell you l'd make you great?

360
00:40:24,779 --> 00:40:27,907
-But we sure got screwed, man.
-Right, Dallas, we got screwed.

361
00:40:34,722 --> 00:40:35,916
Not quite.

362
00:40:37,591 --> 00:40:40,719
And l'd check that case if l were you.

363
00:41:13,494 --> 00:41:17,897
l got a telegram from Ma in Bakersfield.
She's at another revival meeting.

364
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:22,164
What are you going to do,
you going to head back East?

365
00:41:23,337 --> 00:41:24,668
Yeah, l guess so.

366
00:41:25,373 --> 00:41:27,466
California ain't such a bad place.

367
00:41:27,641 --> 00:41:31,236
Well, l'm not all that wild about it.
But l do like the people.

368
00:41:31,779 --> 00:41:33,644
And the music is great.

369
00:41:34,181 --> 00:41:35,512
Thank you.

370
00:41:36,717 --> 00:41:39,618
What about Beekman?
You going to have any problems with him?

371
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:43,312
Beekman's the one with a problem.
He can't cover the bets.

372
00:41:48,729 --> 00:41:53,598
-Orville, what do you say?
-l'm staying here in Jackson. Medical care.

373
00:41:56,337 --> 00:41:59,033
l love the place and l love the people.

374
00:41:59,774 --> 00:42:00,900
Right, Clyde?

375
00:42:01,342 --> 00:42:02,366
Right, Clyde.

376
00:42:33,874 --> 00:42:35,307
Hey, Beddoe!

377
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:37,241
Are you talking to me?

378
00:42:37,578 --> 00:42:40,809
Yeah, l'm talking to you.
We got a little debt to settle.

379
00:42:41,515 --> 00:42:42,311
We do?

380
00:42:45,953 --> 00:42:46,977
$40.

381
00:42:47,922 --> 00:42:49,981
Now, l believe that makes us even.

382
00:42:51,992 --> 00:42:53,186
l believe so.

383
00:42:53,594 --> 00:42:57,428
You know, that was one hell of a fight
you put up over there.

384
00:42:57,531 --> 00:42:59,226
l mean, one hell of a fight.

385
00:42:59,867 --> 00:43:02,392
l understand you boys
had a little scuffle yourself.

386
00:43:03,838 --> 00:43:05,897
Yeah, wasn't half bad.

387
00:43:11,612 --> 00:43:14,445
These things don't look bad
when you get them on straight.

388
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:18,409
No, they look real good.

389
00:43:21,622 --> 00:43:22,953
You take care, Beddoe.

390
00:43:23,691 --> 00:43:24,885
You do the same.

391
00:43:27,127 --> 00:43:28,116
Let's go.

392
00:43:34,768 --> 00:43:38,397
-Are we rich, Widows?
-We are rich!

393
00:43:53,254 --> 00:43:54,551
What do we have here?

394
00:43:55,122 --> 00:43:56,555
New girlfriend, Clyde?

395
00:44:03,497 --> 00:44:06,227
Very nice, but we may have trouble
getting you this one.

396
00:44:12,907 --> 00:44:14,932
We'll do what we can, boy.

397
00:44:38,365 --> 00:44:40,856
l thought l recognized you
and your hairy friend.

398
00:44:40,935 --> 00:44:43,631
Because of you,
l'm stuck out here in this steam bath.

399
00:44:44,104 --> 00:44:46,538
l'm citing you for speeding
and reckless driving.

400
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:49,006
What? We were only doing 50.

401
00:44:49,076 --> 00:44:52,637
-l'm impounding this truck for evidence.
-lmpounded for what?

402
00:44:53,814 --> 00:44:57,341
Evidence for transporting an animal
without certificates of ownership...

403
00:44:57,885 --> 00:44:59,750
...and certificates of inoculation.

404
00:45:00,354 --> 00:45:02,481
Nobody owns Clyde. He's a free person.

405
00:45:02,823 --> 00:45:05,986
The animal goes to the kennel.
The truck goes to the police yard.

406
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:10,656
l'll be roasting out in this desert
for three years because of you, Beddoe.

407
00:45:10,731 --> 00:45:12,096
You're going to pay.

408
00:45:15,469 --> 00:45:16,936
Right turn, Clyde.

409
00:45:20,541 --> 00:45:21,530
Onward.

410
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:32,530
