1
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:04,899
Heil Hitler!

2
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:06,901
Heil Hitler.

3
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,572
Are we ready, Wallenberg?

4
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:14,451
Finally!
When?

5
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,917
It's a matter of days.

6
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,591
At Blitzkrieg. And we'll win it.

7
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:26,765
The Fuehrer has predicted
how long it will last precisely.

8
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:28,260
Guess!

9
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:37,933
One year. Six months.
At the most, two months.

10
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:40,806
We won't even have enough
time to enjoy it.

11
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:46,275
We'll enjoy the time after the war,
commander.

12
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:55,117
Gentlemen, cheers to the war,
Germany, the Fuehrer. Sieg Heil.

13
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:20,675
Wallenberg!

14
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:28,123
I need at least 20 girls.

15
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,889
It'd be easy for you to find them,
except they can't just be beautiful...

16
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,330
...they also have to be intelligent...

17
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:37,892
...and especially of indisputable
national socialist belief.

18
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:42,168
You must comb through all Germany,
through every city, every region.

19
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:47,003
Sift through the countryside, the
factories, the universities, the offices...

20
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,843
...middle class or blue collar,
housewives or employed women...

21
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,644
...virgins or married ones,
examine them carefully.

22
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:58,690
But most of all, I repeat, choose them
based on their political belief system.

23
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,870
Heil Hitler!

24
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:44,060
These three anatomical exhibits
are the best evidence that...

25
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:48,401
...the racial theory,
the essence of Nazi ideology...

26
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:52,739
...is based on scientific data
that has been rigorously tested.

27
00:06:55,948 --> 00:07:00,783
Vices and corruption of an inferior race
are passed on...

28
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:04,414
...from generation to generation
by the chromosomes.

29
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:14,723
For example, the pigmentation of
this Negro is directly related to...

30
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:20,636
...the bestiality of his race and to
the impossibility to render it civil.

31
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:26,770
He died in physical stupor in a fire fight
with the police. Turn him around.

32
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:35,614
Instead, as we'll see,
this prostitute...

33
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:43,259
This prostitute, who died
during an attempted abortion...

34
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:45,296
...is of pure Aryan race.

35
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:49,658
In spite of the vices of her profession
and the corruption of her life...

36
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:54,706
...this corpse,
even in the rigidity of death...

37
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:59,210
...keeps all those typical
characteristics of a superior race.

38
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,135
Are there any questions?

39
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:04,044
Professor, is it true that
Jesus Christ was son of...

40
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:07,313
...a Roman prostitute
and a German soldier?

41
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,977
Without a doubt!

42
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:15,152
There can't be found the slightest trace
of Jewish characteristics in Jesus Christ.

43
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:18,491
He was blond with blue eyes...

44
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:21,930
...typical signs of his German origin.

45
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:28,535
Can you tell me who was the first man
in the world, who realized this fact...

46
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:30,233
...and revealed it to the human race?

47
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:34,074
Yes, sir. Our Fuehrer.
Adolf Hitler.

48
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:40,776
He promised to free us in 6 months from
the Communists and the trade-unions...

49
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:42,446
...and he kept his promise!

50
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:46,575
Today Nazi Law is socially the most
advanced one on earth...

51
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:49,280
...much more than the Fascist Code
in Italy.

52
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,583
And so Italian!

53
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:54,450
I admire the Italians, mom!

54
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:58,590
Me, too, my darling.
They are more Mediterranean...

55
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,898
...but very likeable.

56
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:08,271
They are a bit too exotic,
too colorful for my taste.

57
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:11,169
But in our party there is
a lack of style as well.

58
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:14,405
All these brown shirts,
it's such a vulgar color!

59
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:19,109
And his manners, my dear.
Did you notice how he drinks his tea?

60
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:20,913
By lifting the little pinky up.

61
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:28,522
Miss Enkel, you are forgetting, just as
often as my dad and mom forget...

62
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:32,325
...the National Socialist cannot waste
any time on learning proper etiquette.

63
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:37,399
They are too busy re-establishing
order, which you can't stand up for...

64
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:43,305
...because you're too busy controlling
your pinky and choosing your colors.

65
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:48,638
Don't you realize that you are
a generation of dead people?

66
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,644
Good night!

67
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:04,660
National Socialism is still a great charm!

68
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:10,364
That's basically what we were hoping for
when we supported Hitler in 1933, right?

69
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:13,563
The most important thing is
to be on the side of victory, right?

70
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,733
Well... on history's side, my dear!

71
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:17,740
Cheers!

72
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:18,832
Cheers!

73
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:57,311
"Not for Jews"

74
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:36,780
The Fuehrer is asking
every one of you the following:

75
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:41,643
To contribute with your own means
to the military effort...

76
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:44,655
...for the triumph of
National Socialism of Germany.

77
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:49,158
It would have been easier
to choose prostitutes...

78
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:53,256
...but the Fuehrer has put all of his trust
in the political belief system...

79
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:55,094
...rather than their various techniques.

80
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:58,693
If there is good will, it'll be
easy to learn the technique fast.

81
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,832
It's like killing.

82
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:04,165
The first time one may feel remorse...

83
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,673
...be induced to vomit,
even have insomnia.

84
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:11,241
But by the third time,
one sleeps peacefully.

85
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,547
By the fifth time, one eats a sandwich.

86
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:19,090
Actually, it gets exciting,
there is a stimulus.

87
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:22,323
They are just the same for you.

88
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:25,752
Heil Hitler.

89
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,355
Heil Hitler!

90
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:38,735
Comrades, take off your uniforms.

91
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:24,579
You will now undergo a group exam
by the SS of the Third Reich.

92
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:28,485
This will serve to free you
from your inhibitions...

93
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:32,928
...to be more flexible in your service.

94
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:36,433
The best will be submitted to
a second test...

95
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:41,264
...a more detailed, more specific one.

96
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:53,445
This test was developed expressly for
you by our Center of Psychosomatics.

97
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:59,284
Your duty consists in rejecting nothing.

98
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:02,620
Coitus. Anal coitus.

99
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:06,622
Masturbation. And fellatio.

100
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:11,228
Attention comrades!

101
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:17,572
Have fun, comrades!
Arouse your own fantasy.

102
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:21,774
The Fuehrer and the Homeland
make use even of this.

103
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:24,709
- Heil Hitler!
- Heil Hitler!

104
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,828
Turn to the right!

105
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:46,361
March, right, left, right, left...

106
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:53,503
...two, three, four, right, left,
two, three, four, left, right!

107
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:57,412
Keep your distance, man!

108
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:03,817
Right, left, left, two, three, four, left!

109
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,085
Keep your distance!

110
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:10,424
Stop! Turn to the right!

111
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:12,657
Stand straight!

112
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,814
Go to the right.
Go on! Let's go!

113
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:41,792
Take a girl! Get up there!

114
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:45,626
Go on! Over here!

115
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,906
Marika. She is perfect!

116
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:46,976
Splendid ability to adapt, I must say!

117
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,517
Olga from Hamburg.

118
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:22,111
No.

119
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:28,543
Martha from Danzig.

120
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:00,311
Rejected!

121
00:22:04,856 --> 00:22:06,756
Margherita from Leipzig.

122
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:47,360
Approved!

123
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:50,959
Lena from Düsseldorf.

124
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,040
- What is he?
- A gypsy.

125
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:13,714
Weak. Mediocre. No sense of race.

126
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:15,322
- Is she surely Aryan?
- Yes.

127
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:16,416
What a shame!

128
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,720
Susan from Berlin.

129
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:47,758
Courageous. Decisive.

130
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:52,920
Great in battle!
Unshakable belief in National Socialism!

131
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:57,660
Approved!
Are there any more?

132
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:59,600
That's all of them, Commander.

133
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:03,272
I wanted to ask you what
we should do with the rejects.

134
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:06,838
Girls can be sent to the disciplinary
and re-education centers.

135
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,105
The men...

136
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:20,649
Dear Klaus, we cannot leave any
mouths behind that can talk.

137
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:24,785
Except that they can still be
useful in the work camps...

138
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:28,089
...or to Dr. Savage for his experiments.

139
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,630
Your problem, Klaus...

140
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:34,400
...is you always want to prove
you have a better idea than anyone.

141
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:38,969
Let me repeat: Do exactly as I told you!

142
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:41,407
- Heil!
- Heil Hitler!

143
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:08,066
Where are you going?
Who are you looking for?

144
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:09,331
They are all the same!

145
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:32,917
What scares you the most?
Is it what you eat or what you drink?

146
00:26:33,358 --> 00:26:34,848
Nothing scares me.

147
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:43,595
The paintings that were hanging here
were degenerate art...

148
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:47,768
...expressionistic, French stuff...

149
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:51,137
...and Jewish culture.

150
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,845
Thank you.
I'd prefer a cup of tea.

151
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:06,446
Hey.

152
00:27:08,326 --> 00:27:11,454
Those decadent habits of
the upper middle class!

153
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:17,296
No, quite the contrary.
Those from the upper class drink a lot.

154
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:19,465
I am angry like our Fuehrer.

155
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:24,200
Your damn middle class pride!
You haven't changed.

156
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,972
You are the same way you were
when you were born.

157
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:31,746
I believe in National Socialism.

158
00:27:38,556 --> 00:27:43,152
Believing is not enough.
In order to be a real National Socialist...

159
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:47,322
...you have to know how to
give yourself over, your origins.

160
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:50,825
You must be able to compromise
all the way.

161
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:54,999
You have to humble yourself,
in order to be...

162
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,166
...reborn.

163
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:10,519
Leave.

164
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,851
Goodbye. Nice meeting you.

165
00:28:21,933 --> 00:28:23,924
What do I have to do,
to give myself up?

166
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,202
You must humble yourself.

167
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:36,903
How?

168
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:50,558
Take off your underwear.

169
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,000
Hurry up!

170
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:09,410
Lift your skirt.

171
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:12,004
Higher.

172
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:13,740
Higher!

173
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:14,750
Much higher!

174
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:18,044
Go over there.

175
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:23,750
On your knees.

176
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,419
On your knees!

177
00:29:31,803 --> 00:29:34,829
Like a bitch on four legs.
And now come here!

178
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:39,932
Crawl.

179
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:45,275
Hurry up. Hurry up! Much faster!

180
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:50,785
You see, you are nothing.

181
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:59,586
Just a bitch.
A bitch controlled by me.

182
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:08,296
I like how you resist.
I like your dignity, your pride.

183
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:12,336
Go on.

184
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:18,805
Share yourself with me.

185
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,309
I'll share my power with you!

186
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:36,157
I disgust you.
Kiss me. Kiss me!

187
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:42,830
Do something, God! I am not part
of your world, right? Tell me.

188
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:47,607
You are part of a more precious world.

189
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:47,499
September 1, 1939
Declaration of war on Poland

190
00:32:25,643 --> 00:32:29,841
Long live Zorro! Heil Hitler!

191
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,438
Heil Hitler!

192
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:35,613
Max, Klaus, Darling!

193
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:39,212
Champagne for everyone!
It's on the house.

194
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:43,683
Champagne, a kiss from Kitty!
From Kitty in person!

195
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:49,623
And discounts for the soldiers
on leave!

196
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:03,770
Are you talking about the cripples?

197
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,310
Oh, stop it, please!

198
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:12,821
Right now we're already dealing with
the first injuries and deaths of this war.

199
00:33:13,091 --> 00:33:17,050
Young blond, romantic men suffering
next to the corpses of their horses...

200
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:19,322
...or near the wrecks of their tanks!

201
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,492
A heroic image, right, Cliff?

202
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:24,534
Dino! If there weren't any dead,
there wouldn't be a war...

203
00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:27,502
...and Germany would not be able to
win and dominate the world!

204
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:30,904
And we wouldn't be here having
champagne and such a good time.

205
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:35,105
Well said! Cliff is much more fun
than you are, dear Dino.

206
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,579
He makes even more sense.

207
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:40,776
His America is further away from
Berlin than my city of Naples.

208
00:33:47,325 --> 00:33:52,353
My friends! Girls! Gentlemen!

209
00:33:56,034 --> 00:34:00,027
Play the National anthem immediately!
Otherwise be the conductor.

210
00:34:51,956 --> 00:34:53,856
You are the usual party pooper.

211
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:56,927
Come over.
Today I stopped rationing champagne.

212
00:34:57,495 --> 00:35:01,363
If you are not interested in my girls,
I think you will be in the champagne.

213
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:05,095
Forgive me, Kitty, but I can't.
I have tens of thousands of things to do.

214
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:06,534
I'll send you a car.

215
00:35:06,671 --> 00:35:10,732
And put what inside of it?
Girls or champagne?

216
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:11,864
Just you.

217
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:16,405
Thank you, that's flattering, darling.

218
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:19,506
But it's been a while since I stopped
offering services so that I can get killed.

219
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:22,518
Well, as I told you, if you come over,
I'll be happy.

220
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:25,612
If not, you can keep your ass
glued to the chair. Bye!

221
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,059
Klaus?

222
00:39:06,477 --> 00:39:07,705
The Gestapo!

223
00:39:10,247 --> 00:39:11,612
Are you crazy?

224
00:39:11,982 --> 00:39:17,113
You let those Gestapo brings me here
like a criminal, in order to tell me what?

225
00:39:17,221 --> 00:39:20,486
That you have to commit my girls,
because they are foreigners...

226
00:39:20,591 --> 00:39:24,527
...and close my nightclub?
The Party needs my place.

227
00:39:26,664 --> 00:39:28,029
It's not up to me.

228
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:31,532
And whom the fuck would it be up to?
Himmler, Von Riebentrop?

229
00:39:31,635 --> 00:39:35,435
They are all my clients, except you.
Have they gone crazy, too?

230
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:39,403
I'll make a call to all of them immediately.
I'll show you who Kitty is!

231
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:43,377
Do you think this is the right day, Kitty?
The war has just started.

232
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:46,945
What the fuck does the war
have to do with my work?

233
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:50,043
Do you want us to wear a chastity belt
just because the war has started?

234
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:52,714
Do you want my girls to
become little red swastikas?

235
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:59,022
Wallenberg, you haven't learned
a thing from the Roman Empire.

236
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:02,122
In order to conquer the World
one must be able to laugh, sing.

237
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:06,469
Unless you have no intent to close the
brothel, only to open a singing school.

238
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:09,067
Thank you very much, Kitty.

239
00:40:10,007 --> 00:40:15,240
But our valuable soldiers are already
singing about Germany's greatness.

240
00:40:16,013 --> 00:40:19,574
Don't you think our valuable soldiers...

241
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:26,084
...would like to spend half an hour
in bed in order to come...

242
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,581
...before they leave?

243
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:34,160
But of course. But don't forget that
many of them are married.

244
00:40:34,965 --> 00:40:37,490
Married!
The wives are for breast-feeding.

245
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:41,928
A soldier also wants to shoot his bullets,
not just those the army gives him.

246
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,466
Wallenberg. Sometimes I feel
you don't understand these things.

247
00:40:47,378 --> 00:40:49,938
Is that just because I am not
interested in your whores?

248
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:53,949
But that's not the point.
There is nothing I can do.

249
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:57,448
I am sorry, Kitty.
You have to close your nightclub.

250
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:04,784
What a pain in the ass!
You can ruin me this way!

251
00:41:04,929 --> 00:41:08,057
At least give me some more time.
6 months?

252
00:41:10,234 --> 00:41:15,638
Not even a day. I told you.
The Party needs that place.

253
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:30,980
But I could help you.

254
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:36,156
I could provide you with German girls.

255
00:41:38,028 --> 00:41:40,622
You could get a little villa
in the Green Forest.

256
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:44,899
I thank you, but Kitty has always
been at the center of Berlin...

257
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:47,831
...and she has always used
an international set of girls.

258
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:52,005
You are making a big mistake, Kitty.

259
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:56,840
I would give you skillful, beautiful,
and elegant girls...

260
00:41:57,515 --> 00:42:03,181
...in a private, quiet, discreet area.

261
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:08,424
Really a high-class place.

262
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,517
I'd even offer you a great price.

263
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:14,095
And if I refuse?

264
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:16,029
I don't think that's a good idea.

265
00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:21,632
I really don't think it's a good idea.
You wouldn't just lose your license.

266
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:34,878
Evidently you still don't know me,
Commander.

267
00:42:35,352 --> 00:42:39,220
If necessary, I'll go to Hitler myself!

268
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:53,400
Don't move. Nobody move!

269
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:38,207
They will miss...
They'll miss this panoramic view.

270
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:53,294
Schatzi, I don't care about
changing my address.

271
00:43:54,264 --> 00:43:58,132
Love is the same everywhere.
Thank Heavens.

272
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:02,630
I don't have to change my profession,
I don't have to find someone else.

273
00:44:06,343 --> 00:44:10,541
After it's all over, he'll send me to a villa.

274
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:14,473
I'm such a mess!

275
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:18,815
What's the matter? Are you crying?

276
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,651
Yes, and I don't know why.

277
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:29,156
I don't know. I swear I don't know why,
stupid girl I am.

278
00:44:41,745 --> 00:44:45,340
For Heaven's sake, girls, relax!

279
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:47,347
We are not in the army.

280
00:44:47,451 --> 00:44:52,548
Frankie, bring something to drink.
Something strong. It's freezing in here.

281
00:44:53,223 --> 00:44:56,215
Good girls, very good!

282
00:44:57,027 --> 00:45:01,361
They can certainly listen very well,
Wallenberg, but that's not enough.

283
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:03,929
They come off as amateurs.
Look at this one.

284
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:07,128
Good for a trip to the country,
but not for fucking like a pig.

285
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:08,694
Look at this one!

286
00:45:09,306 --> 00:45:11,137
A child in her arms...

287
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:15,236
...and an iron in her hands,
and you'll have the perfect homemaker.

288
00:45:15,345 --> 00:45:17,040
They have no passion!

289
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:21,150
This one is so refined, she even
makes me feel uncomfortable.

290
00:45:21,251 --> 00:45:23,446
Imagine the poor guy
who has to screw her!

291
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:26,022
She's made for a parlor,
not for a nightclub.

292
00:45:26,123 --> 00:45:29,422
What we need here are girls,
who are soft and warm and...

293
00:45:29,526 --> 00:45:32,984
...most of all always ready
and able to smile in any situation.

294
00:45:33,831 --> 00:45:35,389
Technically they are perfect.

295
00:45:36,166 --> 00:45:39,397
I hope they don't greet their clients
when they enter the room.

296
00:45:39,503 --> 00:45:46,067
I felt so at peace with my other girls.
They could give a dying man a hard on!

297
00:45:48,212 --> 00:45:52,911
All right, loosen them up.
After all that's your job, not mine.

298
00:45:54,284 --> 00:45:58,414
They say you've been extraordinary.
Teach them to become like you.

299
00:46:15,305 --> 00:46:20,174
No, no, no. They are all beautiful,
perfect, too perfect, boring.

300
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:24,111
They look like printed postcards
the soldiers send to their moms.

301
00:46:24,414 --> 00:46:29,442
I need specialists -
girls who can satisfy any request...

302
00:46:29,553 --> 00:46:34,616
...to fulfill the strangest desires,
the most complex perversions.

303
00:46:36,426 --> 00:46:39,793
The clients of Salon Kitty
have imagination.

304
00:46:40,097 --> 00:46:43,294
If any of them doesn't not live up to
your expectations, let me know.

305
00:46:43,901 --> 00:46:45,198
I'm responsible for them all.

306
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:59,642
Who would have known that.
We'll have to take up teaching.

307
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:45,817
Bravo!

308
00:52:49,366 --> 00:52:50,264
Perfect!

309
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:53,663
And now, Wallenberg,
this is your battle point.

310
00:52:55,805 --> 00:52:59,832
You don't rush and do your work
meticulously.

311
00:53:04,147 --> 00:53:08,948
I want to control the girls' relationships
and collect any information they gather.

312
00:53:09,052 --> 00:53:11,179
To trust is fine; to not trust is better.

313
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:16,689
Execute my orders to the letter
to the best of your ability.

314
00:53:18,161 --> 00:53:19,628
And, have fun, Wallenberg.

315
00:53:24,334 --> 00:53:27,030
- What's your name?
- Susan, General.

316
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:29,831
Why do you look at me this way?

317
00:53:30,173 --> 00:53:34,200
You're looking at me as if you know
we have known each other for years.

318
00:53:34,311 --> 00:53:37,212
All Germany knows you, General!

319
00:53:38,148 --> 00:53:40,878
You are the conqueror
and destroyer of Poland.

320
00:53:40,984 --> 00:53:43,976
You can also destroy my body
with these, General.

321
00:53:52,162 --> 00:53:54,062
Don't talk about Poland.

322
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:59,794
War is a sacred thing - besides,
it's too big to fit in this room.

323
00:54:01,671 --> 00:54:03,138
Put on my boots.

324
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,231
Sure, General!

325
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:09,774
- Do you know how to sing?
- Yes, General!

326
00:54:09,879 --> 00:54:11,744
Well, then march and sing!

327
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:26,251
Is that fine, General?

328
00:54:32,168 --> 00:54:34,636
- Take off the pants!
- Of course, General!

329
00:54:34,738 --> 00:54:36,535
And stop calling me General!

330
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:39,037
Call me Greta.

331
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:57,552
Do you like it? Can you feel it?
It burns, right?

332
00:54:57,661 --> 00:55:00,960
Tell me that you like it.
Tell me that it burns!

333
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:06,633
Spread them! Take it, yes, yes!
Take it!

334
00:55:06,936 --> 00:55:11,805
It's of a comrade, a top General of
the Duce, by the name of Cavelucci.

335
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:15,301
Tell me you like it.
Tell me it burns you!

336
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:20,878
Tell me it's killing you!
That it's splitting you in half!

337
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:25,250
Tell me, tell me
it's splitting you in half!

338
00:55:25,355 --> 00:55:27,823
Give it to me! Give it to me!

339
00:55:29,025 --> 00:55:32,859
- Tell me it's killing you, tell me!
- You're killing me! Give it to me!

340
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:36,258
- Tell me, it's killing you!
- Give it to me!

341
00:55:37,067 --> 00:55:40,332
Tell me!
Tell me, tell me, and tell me!!

342
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:47,507
Yeah, I like it very much!

343
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:51,337
I'm the infamous woman! Oh, yes!

344
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:01,679
Later on!

345
00:56:05,462 --> 00:56:06,690
I like it!

346
00:56:56,413 --> 00:57:05,412
You'll notice in a month or two, if I am
right, the military bases will change.

347
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:14,091
The British will start telling us that
in Oslo and Copenhagen...

348
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:19,159
...the language will be English,
my favorite project!

349
00:57:21,204 --> 00:57:23,104
English is a nice language!

350
00:57:24,307 --> 00:57:27,834
A tongue for your huge cunt,
and a beautiful ass.

351
00:57:28,478 --> 00:57:33,438
Klaus! Type the report with
the very same words.

352
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:38,280
The first copy is for the Chancellery.

353
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:42,619
The other is for the Reich fuehrer
Himmler - urgent, an absolute priority!

354
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:44,957
Without checking it first?

355
00:57:45,061 --> 00:57:48,929
Klaus, how many times do I have to
repeat not to be zealous?

356
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:54,126
I assume total responsibility
for this operation!

357
00:57:55,338 --> 00:57:56,464
Personally!

358
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:34,003
Honestly, I was skeptical.
Material coming from who knows where!

359
00:58:35,211 --> 00:58:37,406
Girls who are not ready.
They made me spit blood.

360
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:40,005
I swear that for a few days
I expected a catastrophe!

361
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:43,410
But now it's sold out every evening!

362
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:47,513
You can see from the champagne!
Now it can be found only at your place.

363
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:51,521
I know where to get it.
Riebentrop is my friend.

364
00:58:51,661 --> 00:58:54,528
Oh, well, then it's him
who gets you this, right?!

365
00:59:36,306 --> 00:59:37,967
Are you from the front?

366
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:47,577
You made love to me
as if you hated me.

367
00:59:50,787 --> 00:59:51,981
No, that's not true.

368
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:53,578
Would you like to do some more?

369
00:59:56,025 --> 00:59:57,014
Always.

370
00:59:57,827 --> 00:59:58,816
Me, too.

371
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:03,589
Of course. Of course.

372
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:05,495
It's your profession.

373
01:00:07,971 --> 01:00:11,600
It's a pity, though, that
you don't know what it means.

374
01:00:11,741 --> 01:00:12,935
Why are you here?

375
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:19,343
Are you on leave?
Don't you want to talk?

376
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:22,611
I like to screw.

377
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:26,445
But if you are not into it...

378
01:00:26,756 --> 01:00:28,087
I am into it, too.

379
01:00:32,929 --> 01:00:34,089
That's not true.

380
01:00:37,166 --> 01:00:38,633
Why do you say such a thing?

381
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:44,795
It's not true.

382
01:00:48,578 --> 01:00:51,570
But in the end I don't care.
You are here for this, right?

383
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:54,639
So, open your legs.

384
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:01,150
With pleasure.

385
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:15,998
Not that way.

386
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:20,673
No. Without anger.

387
01:01:23,246 --> 01:01:24,736
With tenderness.

388
01:01:31,254 --> 01:01:32,778
Let yourself go.

389
01:02:30,713 --> 01:02:33,273
Margherita's report.

390
01:02:35,651 --> 01:02:41,089
Hans Reiter,
lieutenant of the Luftwaffe...

391
01:02:41,824 --> 01:02:46,420
...on leave from the front,
not willing to talk.

392
01:02:47,296 --> 01:02:49,423
He only wanted to make love.

393
01:02:50,166 --> 01:02:52,157
He made love more than once.

394
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:44,479
You're beautiful.

395
01:03:45,154 --> 01:03:49,488
Even if you are just a whore,
making love with you is nice. I like it.

396
01:03:54,964 --> 01:03:56,295
I hate life.

397
01:03:57,834 --> 01:03:59,825
But I have nothing against you.

398
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:04,162
Are you on leave for a medal?

399
01:04:05,107 --> 01:04:08,907
Yes, so that I can hang it
on my shoulder.

400
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:19,177
Are you still going to fight?

401
01:04:22,258 --> 01:04:24,419
Maybe I'm not a good soldier.

402
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:27,518
When do you have to leave?

403
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:31,192
Soon. In 10 days.

404
01:04:33,369 --> 01:04:35,530
That's an eternity for making love.

405
01:04:36,739 --> 01:04:40,197
Yes, an eternity that ends too soon.

406
01:04:45,481 --> 01:04:50,714
If I could take you with me, so that
I can screw you anytime I want to...

407
01:04:55,391 --> 01:04:57,382
It's really nice with you.

408
01:05:00,796 --> 01:05:02,286
You're exaggerating.

409
01:05:05,067 --> 01:05:07,058
Do you regret not coming along?

410
01:05:07,169 --> 01:05:11,105
No. It's just that it's unfair
when you are exaggerating.

411
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:18,244
Would you regret it, if I fell in love
with you... just a little bit?

412
01:05:20,516 --> 01:05:22,245
Do you think it's ridiculous?

413
01:05:24,487 --> 01:05:29,151
Love is a word used by a man and
a woman spending time in bed together.

414
01:05:30,793 --> 01:05:32,090
Sure, sure, sure.

415
01:06:02,124 --> 01:06:05,287
Hurry, hurry, over here!
Get into the shelter!

416
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:08,225
Where is the shelter?!

417
01:06:08,397 --> 01:06:10,456
Over here! Hurry up!

418
01:06:11,567 --> 01:06:16,004
To the shelter!
Hurry, hurry, and hurry.

419
01:06:16,105 --> 01:06:17,629
Over here!

420
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:10,347
Congratulations!

421
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:20,532
Congratulations to myself
for having found you.

422
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:28,032
I have a gift for you
before I return to the battle.

423
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:43,825
I saw light underneath the door.
Aren't you afraid?

424
01:07:43,926 --> 01:07:48,693
The British will never bomb Berlin.
Marshall Behring himself told us so.

425
01:07:48,798 --> 01:07:51,460
That's not a good reason for
getting drunk completely naked.

426
01:07:51,801 --> 01:07:54,065
- Would you like to drink with us?
- With pleasure.

427
01:07:54,236 --> 01:07:56,568
- Today is a very important anniversary.
- Of what?

428
01:07:57,073 --> 01:07:59,871
It's exactly a week now
Margherita and I know each other.

429
01:08:00,076 --> 01:08:02,670
I wish you hundreds of these days!
The same to you, Margherita.

430
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:21,090
I don't like anniversaries.
I only like to drink champagne...

431
01:08:21,464 --> 01:08:24,024
...with him, or maybe
not even with him.

432
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:28,430
I love champagne, and that's all
there is to it.

433
01:08:29,205 --> 01:08:31,696
Too many good wishes are
a bad omen.
