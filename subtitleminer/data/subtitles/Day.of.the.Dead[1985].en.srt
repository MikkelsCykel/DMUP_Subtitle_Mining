You need a sedative.
You're behaving dangerously.

- Well, I don't need your help.

We've got to have sterile

goes down the toilet
due to contamination.

that you work
with what you got.

And you'd better
start showing me some results...

or you won't have that
very much longer.

How can we show you results when we
don't have the proper working conditions?

195
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:47,686
We're in a desperate situation
here. We need each other.

196
00:19:47,727 --> 00:19:50,730
Can't we just get along? [Man] you
need us, the way I see it, lady.

all. [Steel] Fuckin' "a. "

it is you're doin' in there,

just what the hell my men
are riskin' their asses for.

200
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:09,207
If there was more cooperation, your men
wouldn't have to risk their asses as often.

201

[Rifle cocks]

- [Chuckles] no shit.

while until we can evaluate his condition.

the edge. He's turning into jell-o.

spicks say "yellow": Jell-o!

00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:36,734
Miguel is seriously disturbed.
He's close to the breaking point,

207
00:20:36,776 --> 00:20:39,202
and that's dangerous
for all of us.

He can't handle
any more stress right now.

209
00:20:43,241 --> 00:20:47,745
Well, maybe I should cut off
his extracurricular activities.

210
00:20:49,247 --> 00:20:52,215
Maybe you're
keepin' him too busy at night.

211

We're talking about a man's
life here, you son of a bitch,

and the lives of others
he might put in jeopardy.

Maybe I should put him in
quarantine. How 'bout it, Steel?

You call it, Captain.
I'll build him a cage.

not be a bad idea...

and including your boyfriend.

Out of the frying pan,
into the fire.

00:21:56,272 --> 00:22:00,234
I thought cooper was an asshole, but
he was a sweetheart next to Rhodes.

230
00:22:00,276 --> 00:22:04,781
We could be in real trouble. You'd better watch
yourself... I mean, physically watch yourself.

00:22:04,822 --> 00:22:08,284
I can handle it. Don't worry.
It's not going to come to that.

We've just gotta pound some logic
into their heads. Impossible.

Where's dr. Logan?

Frankenstein? He's in his
laboratory. Where else?

235
00:22:20,129 --> 00:22:24,759
[Man] there's a loss of initiative, caution,
many of the human cognitive functions.

236
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:28,763
Apparently the result of
decay in the frontal, parietal,

237
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:31,481
temporal
and occipital lobes.

238

On revival, the rate of
decomposition slows substantially.

[Switch clicks] Indications
are that these beings...

00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:42,110
could function
over a period of years...

241
00:22:42,151 --> 00:22:47,407
in cases of early revival, 10 to 12 years
before decay would threaten mobility.

[Moaning]

244
00:22:56,666 --> 00:23:00,545
The brain is the engine, Sarah,
the motor that drives them.

245
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:03,172
They don't need any blood flow, don't
need any of their internal organs.

246
00:23:03,297 --> 00:23:07,266
Now, I致e severed all
the vital organs in this one.

247
00:23:07,301 --> 00:23:10,805
There's nothing left of the corpse but
brain and limbs, and still it functions.

248
00:23:11,305 --> 00:23:15,274
Oh, look, Sarah. Look.
[Grunting]

249
00:23:15,309 --> 00:23:19,689
See, it wants me. It wants
food, but it has no stomach.

250
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:22,650
It can take no nourishment
from what it ingests.

251
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:27,155
It's working on instinct, a
deep, dark, primordial instinct.

252
00:23:27,196 --> 00:23:31,576
Decomposition occurs first in
the frontal lobes, the neocortex,

253
00:23:31,617 --> 00:23:34,579
and next in the limbic
system, the middle brain.

254
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:39,834
But the core... the core is the last
thing to be attacked by the decay.

255
00:23:40,334 --> 00:23:44,338
It's the "r" complex, Sarah... that
central bit of prehistoric jelly...

256
00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:47,341
that we inherited
from the reptiles.

257
00:23:47,842 --> 00:23:51,971
Here. I've gone into the center here
and attacked the "r" complex discretely.

258
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:54,564
I've removed it from the
equation... this corpse.

259
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:59,103
I believe this creature would be benign even
if it had its eyesight and its other senses.

260
00:23:59,145 --> 00:24:02,106
Its primitive instincts
have been erased.

It still has motor function, probably
still has powers of deliberation.

263
00:24:18,122 --> 00:24:21,090
It can be domesticated,
Sarah, don't you see?

264
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:25,129
It can be conditioned to behave
the way we want it to behave.

265
00:24:25,171 --> 00:24:29,008
And all that's required
is 15 hours of fancy surgery...

266
00:24:29,508 --> 00:24:31,969
that only a handful of people
are trained to do.

267
00:24:32,011 --> 00:24:36,015
We were going to stop work on the neurophysical,
concentrate on something more practical.

268
00:24:36,515 --> 00:24:39,644
These finds are central to the
condition. I will not stop work...

269
00:24:40,144 --> 00:24:44,482
that might lead to an answer, let alone in
an area that is central to the condition.

270

[Exhales forcefully] But you're just proving
theories that were advanced months ago.

You're making a lot of assumptions.

to define what's happening...

for what's making it happen.

And just slicing up too many
specimens. It's extremely dangerous...

to go up on top
and round them up in the wild.

276

Well, we can't control them.
What happened to this one?

00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:13,302
[Doctor] it was too unruly. I couldn't
handle it. I had to destroy it.

we are losing
the cooperation of the men.

I'm not even sure they'll go up top
when we run out of the specimens we have.

00:25:24,355 --> 00:25:28,067
I'm not sure they won't just
try to shut us down completely.

282
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:32,530
Well, I値l show them results.
I'll show them results.

283
00:25:32,571 --> 00:25:37,576
I'll show them that these creatures can
be domesticated even without the surgery.

284
00:25:37,618 --> 00:25:42,081
Knowing what they are, we can
begin to approach them properly,

285
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:44,542
condition them,
control them.

Yes, this is major cooper.

00:26:03,978 --> 00:26:09,108
I needed him, Sarah. He's helping us more
now than he ever did when he was alive.

289
00:26:09,608 --> 00:26:14,989
- But I saw the grave.
- They buried one of the specimens.

Jesus. God, Logan.

00:26:18,242 --> 00:26:21,711
Do you know what they'll do to
you if they find out about this?

295
00:26:39,388 --> 00:26:42,016
[Gasping]

296
00:26:52,026 --> 00:26:54,493
[Moaning]

297
00:26:54,528 --> 00:26:58,491
Not a peep. Long-range or short,
high-band or low, I can't raise anybody.

298
00:26:58,532 --> 00:27:02,453
[Man] how can that be, McDermott?
There must be other groups like us.

299
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:06,415
Somebody else must be tryin' to
radio. Yeah. What the hell is this?

300
00:27:06,457 --> 00:27:09,376
Maybe we are the only ones left.
I'm sure there's others.

301
00:27:09,418 --> 00:27:12,922
This is not the best place to be sending
from, and a lot of the equipment I知 using...

302
00:27:13,422 --> 00:27:15,925
has been rotting down here
since the second world war.

303
00:27:15,966 --> 00:27:19,136
Well, it's up to you
to get it workin' right.

304
00:27:19,178 --> 00:27:22,681
Lay off the fuckin' booze
for a while, why don't ya?

305
00:27:22,723 --> 00:27:25,684
And get somebody
on that fuckin' horn, pronto.

306
00:27:26,185 --> 00:27:30,689
Well, if we stay down here long enough, I値l
have to lay off the fuckin' booze, Steel,

307
00:27:30,731 --> 00:27:34,652
'cause there won't fuckin'
be any of it fuckin' left.

308
00:27:34,693 --> 00:27:40,199
In the meanwhile, I will continue to indulge
myself, and I will continue doing my best...

309
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:43,160
in the good fight
against dry rot and rust.

310
00:27:43,202 --> 00:27:47,706
Yeah? Well, your best
ain't good enough, asshole.

311
00:27:48,207 --> 00:27:52,211
You think I知 not aware of our situation?
You think I want to stay isolated down here?

312
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:54,734
You know, I壇 make a desperate
effort to raise somebody...

313
00:27:54,769 --> 00:27:57,216
just in the hope of gettin' away
from your nasty mouth, Steel.

314
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:59,718
The fact is...

315
00:28:02,221 --> 00:28:04,765
the fact is...

316
00:28:05,808 --> 00:28:09,770
either we are
the only ones left...

317
00:28:09,812 --> 00:28:13,816
or there's nobody within range of my
puny little second world war signals.

318
00:28:13,857 --> 00:28:16,318
We used to talk to Washington all
the time. They could hear us then.

319
00:28:16,819 --> 00:28:19,280
We were on relays then.
We weren't over the air.

320
00:28:19,321 --> 00:28:22,324
You know, the power's off on the
mainland now, in case you haven't heard.

321
00:28:22,366 --> 00:28:28,289
All the shopping malls are closed.
We don't appreciate your jokes.

322
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:32,334
Keep it up, and I値l shove that
bottle of yours right up your wise ass.

323
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:36,213
I've got better things to do than listen
to this kindergarten. Are we finished?

324
00:28:36,255 --> 00:28:39,682
No, we ain't
finished here, lady. Sit down.

325
00:28:39,717 --> 00:28:43,185
What else do you want? We've given
you the reports for this week.

326
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:46,724
We've given you everything you've
asked for. You've given us greek salad.

327
00:28:47,224 --> 00:28:52,229
Formulas, equations, a lot of
fancy terms that don't mean a thing.

328
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:58,277
I wanna know if you're doin' something that's
gonna help us out of this deep shit we're in,

329
00:28:58,318 --> 00:29:02,740
or if you're all in there
just jerkin' each other off.

330
00:29:02,781 --> 00:29:07,244
She doesn't have to jerk off like the rest of
us, Captain. She got an honest-to-god dick...

331
00:29:07,286 --> 00:29:10,539
to get off on, huh?
[Laughs mockingly]

332
00:29:10,581 --> 00:29:13,751
It may be yellow,
but it's still a dick!

333
00:29:13,792 --> 00:29:16,336
[Yells, laughs]
[Others laugh]

334
00:29:16,378 --> 00:29:19,882
I said we ain't
finished here, lady.

335
00:29:19,923 --> 00:29:22,885
Sit down.

336
00:29:23,135 --> 00:29:26,138
Sit down, or so help me,
god, I値l have you shot.

337
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,643
- You'll what?
- I said,

338
00:29:31,685 --> 00:29:34,605
"I値l have you shot. "

339
00:29:34,646 --> 00:29:38,150
Have you lost your mind?
No, ma'am.

340
00:29:40,652 --> 00:29:46,575
Have you? I just told you I was willing to
kill you if you didn't get back in your chair.

341
00:29:46,617 --> 00:29:49,501
You didn't get back
in your chair.

342
00:29:49,536 --> 00:29:52,748
Goddamn it! You can't
shove us around like this.

343
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:55,918
Since when did this
become a military operation?

344
00:29:55,959 --> 00:30:01,423
Since I took over.
Steel, shoot that woman.

345
00:30:01,465 --> 00:30:04,927
Bang! You're dead.

346
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:15,062
Shoot that woman
or you're dead.

347
00:30:15,562 --> 00:30:18,524
You think
I知 fuckin' around, Steel?

348
00:30:18,565 --> 00:30:21,985
You're wrong.

349
00:30:22,027 --> 00:30:26,156
Now, you got till a count of
five, and that's two you wasted.

350
00:30:26,198 --> 00:30:29,243
- [Spits]
- That's three.

351
00:30:29,284 --> 00:30:32,246
- Four.
- Sit down, Sarah.

352
00:30:32,287 --> 00:30:35,249
What is this?
Shut up and sit down.

353
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:38,794
That's five, Steel.
[Gun cocks] All right.

354
00:30:38,835 --> 00:30:42,297
All right.

355
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:53,934
- [Gun cocks]
- No!

356
00:31:08,198 --> 00:31:14,204
Anybody else have any questions about the way
things are gonna run around here from now on?

357
00:31:26,967 --> 00:31:31,972
This ain't
a goddamn field trip, people.

358
00:31:32,014 --> 00:31:35,475
This is a fuckin' war!

359
00:31:35,726 --> 00:31:39,980
I'm not down in this cave for my
health. I'm down here on orders.

360
00:31:40,022 --> 00:31:44,199
Your orders are to facilitate
the job of this scientific team.

361
00:31:44,234 --> 00:31:49,239
This is a civilian team, and we don't
have to be subjected to your tyranny.

362
00:31:49,614 --> 00:31:53,368
Who's being subjected
to what, Fisher?

363
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:56,746
You've lost one man. [Men] Yeah. Right.

364
00:31:56,781 --> 00:32:00,083
We've lost five.
[Men murmuring agreement]

365
00:32:00,125 --> 00:32:05,130
Where does it say we gotta keep those
dumb fucks next door to where we sleep?

366
00:32:05,172 --> 00:32:10,135
Where does it say we should do any one
thing but shoot the mothers in the head?

367
00:32:10,177 --> 00:32:15,640
[Logan] We don't have enough ammunition
to shoot them all in the head.

368
00:32:15,682 --> 00:32:18,602
The time to have done that
would've been at the beginning.

369
00:32:19,102 --> 00:32:24,107
No. We let them overrun us.
They have overrun us, you know.

370
00:32:25,108 --> 00:32:27,611
We're in the minority now.

371
00:32:28,111 --> 00:32:31,114
Something like 400,000
to one, by my calculations.

372
00:32:31,615 --> 00:32:34,082
I haven't eaten.
Is there food?

373
00:32:34,117 --> 00:32:38,086
You were supposed to be
here at 7:00 sharp, mister.

374
00:32:38,121 --> 00:32:41,374
I know. Sarah told me. I'm sorry. I
couldn't break away. Is there food?

375
00:32:41,416 --> 00:32:44,628
Listen, egghead, let me bring you
up to date on what's... excuse me.

376
00:32:44,669 --> 00:32:46,595
Let me...
excuse me!

377
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:51,259
- Is there food?
- I'm runnin' this monkey farm now, Frankenstein,

378
00:32:51,301 --> 00:32:56,264
and I wanna know what the fuck
you're doin' with my time!

379
00:33:00,769 --> 00:33:03,480
'Cause if we're just
jerkin' off here,

380
00:33:03,522 --> 00:33:06,114
I知 gonna have my men
blow the piss...

381
00:33:06,149 --> 00:33:09,117
out of those precious specimens
of yours, [Men murmuring agreement]

382
00:33:09,152 --> 00:33:14,533
And we're gonna get the hell out of here and
leave you and your highfalutin asshole friends...

383
00:33:14,574 --> 00:33:17,035
to rot
in this stinkin' sewer!

384
00:33:17,536 --> 00:33:20,038
Is that food enough for ya?

385
00:33:20,163 --> 00:33:26,002
Where will you go, Captain?
You can destroy my specimens,

386
00:33:26,044 --> 00:33:29,172
but what about the millions more
that are waiting to greet you outside?

387
00:33:29,214 --> 00:33:32,641
Do you really think you can
"blow the piss" out of them?

388
00:33:32,676 --> 00:33:37,681
All of them? They have you in a
hopeless situation, strategically.

389
00:33:37,722 --> 00:33:42,269
You're lost. Well,
you're lost unless...

390
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:46,773
unless what? Unless what, Frankenstein?

391
00:33:46,815 --> 00:33:49,276
- Unless you can make them behave.
- [Men scoffing]

392
00:33:49,317 --> 00:33:53,321
This is a fuckin' loony bin! I ain't bein'
paid enough to work in a fuckin' loony bin!

393
00:33:53,363 --> 00:33:57,701
- I ain't bein' paid at all!
- Paid? What the hell are they payin' him for?

394
00:33:57,742 --> 00:34:02,205
[Captain] All right.
Shut up! Just shut up!

395
00:34:04,708 --> 00:34:08,211
What the hell are you
talkin' about, Frankenstein?

396
00:34:08,253 --> 00:34:11,680
I'll be able to show you
soon enough. Sarah knows.

397
00:34:11,715 --> 00:34:15,719
She's seen the progress I致e been
making. Isn't that right, Sarah?

398
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,722
Yes. There's been some progress.

399
00:34:18,763 --> 00:34:22,183
What kind of progress?

400
00:34:22,225 --> 00:34:25,729
What are you talkin' about, "make
them behave"? What does that mean?

401
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:28,982
It means keeping them from
wanting to eat us, for one thing.

402
00:34:29,107 --> 00:34:33,612
It means keeping them in
check, controlling them.

403
00:34:33,737 --> 00:34:38,241
- Controlling them.
- When are you gonna show us something we can understand?

404
00:34:38,742 --> 00:34:40,869
Very close. Very close.
I think in a matter of weeks...

405
00:34:41,369 --> 00:34:44,831
I don't think there's any way you can
tell how long anything is going to take.

406
00:34:44,873 --> 00:34:48,877
It could be months; it could be years before
we know exactly what we're dealing with.

407
00:34:48,918 --> 00:34:51,838
[Men murmuring]
Sarah's research...

408
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:57,344
[Louder] Sarah's research is more
esoteric than mine. [Murmuring stops]

409
00:34:57,385 --> 00:35:02,390
She's looking for a way to reverse the
process, a way to eradicate the problem.

410
00:35:02,432 --> 00:35:05,497
That could take a long time,
a very long time.

411
00:35:05,532 --> 00:35:08,563
She may never find
what she's looking for.

412
00:35:08,605 --> 00:35:11,399
We have a limited supply
of chemical agents.

413
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,402
Our equipment
is hopelessly inadequate.

414
00:35:14,903 --> 00:35:20,033
McDermott doesn't
have decent radio gear.

415
00:35:20,533 --> 00:35:24,496
Now you're tellin' me that you
don't have the shit you need?

416
00:35:24,537 --> 00:35:28,792
We're runnin' low on ammunition. We're
runnin' low on men, for chrissakes!

417
00:35:28,833 --> 00:35:33,046
It was very rushed. This operation
was put together in a matter of days.

418
00:35:33,088 --> 00:35:37,342
Yeah, well, it can all be taken
apart in a matter of minutes, lady,

419
00:35:37,383 --> 00:35:41,554
and I知 here to tell you that
I知 ready to do that little thing.

420
00:35:41,596 --> 00:35:44,022
I'm ready to
take the next train outta here!

421
00:35:44,057 --> 00:35:47,025
[Logan] I ask you again,
Captain: Where will you go?

422
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:50,563
You have no choices. You'll have to
give us the weeks that we've asked for.

423
00:35:50,605 --> 00:35:54,526
You have to give us
however long it takes. Look.

424
00:35:54,567 --> 00:35:57,035
There have to be survivors
in Washington. [Man] my ass.

425
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:59,531
They have more sophisticated shelters
than this one. [Man] bullshit.

426
00:35:59,572 --> 00:36:03,576
There have to be people in those shelters
who know about us, who know where we are.

427
00:36:03,618 --> 00:36:06,079
With no radio contact,
they'll come looking for us.

428
00:36:06,121 --> 00:36:09,082
- [Men murmuring]
- I said shut up!

429
00:36:22,595 --> 00:36:26,599
You got
a little more time.

430
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:30,103
A little more.
I ain't sayin' how much.

431
00:36:32,605 --> 00:36:38,111
But you'd better start showin' me some
results, and you'd better not piss me off.

432
00:36:38,152 --> 00:36:43,616
You understand? Nothin' happens around
here without my knowin' about it!

433
00:36:45,618 --> 00:36:50,707
And anybody fucks
with my command,

434
00:36:50,748 --> 00:36:56,754
they get court-martialed,
they get executed.

435
00:37:01,259 --> 00:37:05,263
You'd better know
I mean it, too, people.

436
00:37:14,897 --> 00:37:19,611
[Men murmuring] He wouldn't have
done it. I can't believe he would've.

437
00:37:19,652 --> 00:37:23,573
No, he wouldn't
have done it.

438
00:37:23,615 --> 00:37:28,119
- He would've had Steel do it.
- He can't be that inhuman.

439
00:37:28,161 --> 00:37:33,082
No. He's human. That's
what scares me, you know.

440
00:37:33,124 --> 00:37:38,630
He won't shoot Billy 'cause he doesn't
have anybody else who knows electronics.

441
00:37:38,671 --> 00:37:42,592
He won't shoot me,
'cause I知 his ride.

442
00:37:42,634 --> 00:37:48,139
He probably won't shoot old Frankenstein,
'cause the old doc can talk him silly.

443
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,601
But the rest of you...

444
00:37:51,643 --> 00:37:55,146
better start worrying,
you know.

445
00:38:01,402 --> 00:38:05,406
Maybe if we tried working together,
we could ease some of the tensions.

446
00:38:05,448 --> 00:38:09,410
- We're all pulling in different directions.
- That's the trouble, Sarah.

447
00:38:09,911 --> 00:38:13,915
People got different ideas
concerning what they want out of life.

You are afraid,
aren't you?

450
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:04,757
Just as afraid as I am.

451
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,762
Why don't you take a sedative,
Sarah, so you can sleep?

452
00:39:12,306 --> 00:39:17,228
You're full of shit, Sarah, you know
that? You're really full of shit.

453
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:21,044
I'm through with you.

454
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:24,819
Fine then. Get out.

455
00:39:24,861 --> 00:39:27,822
Just get out!

I'm all right.
Here.

00:40:53,324 --> 00:40:55,826
I've just filled it up.
Got a refill as well.

464
00:40:55,868 --> 00:40:58,600
No, thanks.
I'm all right. Really.

465
00:40:58,635 --> 00:41:01,332
It's just brandy.
Good for the heart.

466
00:41:01,832 --> 00:41:04,835
It's shit for your heart,
and it eats up your liver.

[Coughs]

468
00:41:54,593 --> 00:41:58,597
We don't get a lot of visitors
out here, and we like it that way.

469
00:42:00,099 --> 00:42:03,602
Here it is: The Ritz.

Madam.

471
00:42:12,987 --> 00:42:15,990
John's probably
out the back.

472
00:42:26,125 --> 00:42:29,753
Hey! Well,
what do you know.

473
00:42:29,795 --> 00:42:33,841
Welcome
to civilization, Sarah.

474
00:42:33,883 --> 00:42:37,887
The last holdout.
It's pretty nice.

475
00:42:38,888 --> 00:42:41,891
Nicer than we got inside.

476
00:42:43,392 --> 00:42:47,855
- Not a bad idea.
- It's a little safer where you are.

477
00:42:47,897 --> 00:42:50,399
But we like to live dangerously,
Billy boy and me, you know.

478
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:55,905
That's a laugh. I haven't seen you do
anything dangerous since we got here.

479
00:42:55,946 --> 00:43:00,409
We stickin' around.
That's gettin' a bit dangerous,

480
00:43:00,451 --> 00:43:03,913
as I hope you noticed
this evening.

481
00:43:06,916 --> 00:43:09,418
You're a mystery to me.

482
00:43:10,419 --> 00:43:12,421
You really are.

483
00:43:13,923 --> 00:43:17,426
Not like
those other goons in there.

484
00:43:17,468 --> 00:43:21,972
You have a sense of...
[Scoffs]

485
00:43:22,014 --> 00:43:26,393
Of what? [Chuckles] Never mind.

486
00:43:26,435 --> 00:43:29,396
No, no, no. Come on.
Let's talk about it.

487
00:43:29,438 --> 00:43:31,899
I came down here to get
drunk. I don't have the energy.

488
00:43:31,941 --> 00:43:37,947
Hey, hey. It takes more energy to keep
quiet than it does to speak the mind.

489
00:43:37,988 --> 00:43:41,450
Go ahead. Let go of what you got, now.

490
00:43:43,452 --> 00:43:45,913
You were sent down here
to do a job.

491
00:43:45,955 --> 00:43:50,459
My job is to fly the whirlybird.
I've been doin' that job just fine.

492
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,962
You have the protection of this facility.
You eat our food. You drink our water.

493
00:43:54,004 --> 00:43:57,966
And you don't lift a finger
to help. Neither one of you.

494
00:44:02,971 --> 00:44:05,474
[John laughing]

495
00:44:12,981 --> 00:44:16,944
We don't believe in what
you're doin' here, Sarah.

496
00:44:16,985 --> 00:44:20,948
Hey, you know what all they
keep down here in this cave?

497
00:44:20,989 --> 00:44:26,495
Man, they got the books and the
records of the top 500 companies.

498
00:44:26,537 --> 00:44:29,957
They got the defense department
budget down here.

499
00:44:29,998 --> 00:44:33,001
And they got the negative
for all your favorite movies.

500
00:44:33,502 --> 00:44:38,382
They got microfilm with tax
return and newspaper stories.

501
00:44:38,424 --> 00:44:41,385
They got immigration records,
census reports,

502
00:44:41,885 --> 00:44:44,388
and they got official accounts of
all the wars and plane crashes...

503
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:48,350
and volcano eruptions and
earthquakes and fires and floods...

504
00:44:48,392 --> 00:44:51,895
and all the other disasters that
interrupted the flow of things...

505
00:44:51,937 --> 00:44:55,357
in the good old U.S. Of A.

506
00:44:55,399 --> 00:44:58,902
Now, what does it matter,
Sarah darling?

507
00:44:59,403 --> 00:45:01,947
All this filing
and record keeping?

508
00:45:01,989 --> 00:45:07,244
We ever gonna give a shit? We even
gonna get a chance to see it all?

509
00:45:09,121 --> 00:45:13,625
This is a great big
14-mile tombstone!

510
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:16,295
[Voice echoing] Tombstone!
[Distant moaning]

511
00:45:16,336 --> 00:45:20,507
With an epitaph on it that
nobody gonna bother to read.

512
00:45:20,883 --> 00:45:24,386
Now, here you come... here you come
with a whole new set of charts...

513
00:45:24,428 --> 00:45:26,847
and graphs and records.

514
00:45:26,889 --> 00:45:30,893
What you gonna do? Bury them down
here with all the other relics...

515
00:45:30,934 --> 00:45:32,895
of what once was?

516
00:45:35,397 --> 00:45:39,318
Let me tell you what else. Yeah,
I知 gonna tell you what else.

517
00:45:39,818 --> 00:45:45,324
You ain't never gonna figure it out,
just like they never figured out...

518
00:45:45,365 --> 00:45:48,285
why the stars
are where they're at.

519
00:45:48,327 --> 00:45:52,831
It ain't mankind's job
to figure that stuff out.

520
00:45:53,332 --> 00:45:56,460
So what you're doin'
is a waste of time, Sarah.

521
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:59,463
And time is all
we got left, you know.

522
00:46:00,839 --> 00:46:06,345
What I知 doing...
is all there's left to do.

523
00:46:06,386 --> 00:46:09,306
Shame on you.
There's plenty to do.

524
00:46:09,806 --> 00:46:14,937
Plenty to do. So long as there's you
and me and maybe some other people,

525
00:46:15,437 --> 00:46:19,900
we could start over, start
fresh, get some babies.

526
00:46:19,942 --> 00:46:24,446
And teach 'em, Sarah, teach
'em never to come over here...

527
00:46:24,488 --> 00:46:28,825
- and dig these records out.

Hey.

529

You want to put some kind
of explanation...

530
00:46:39,836 --> 00:46:43,507
down here
before you leave?

531
00:46:43,548 --> 00:46:47,552
Here's one as good as
any you're likely to find.

532
00:46:50,263 --> 00:46:53,767
We're being punished
by the creator.

533
00:46:55,268 --> 00:46:58,271
He visited a curse
on us...

534
00:46:59,272 --> 00:47:02,776
so we man could look at...

535
00:47:09,282 --> 00:47:11,785
what hell was like.

536
00:47:14,788 --> 00:47:18,792

blow ourselves up...

537
00:47:18,834 --> 00:47:22,754
and put a big hole
in his sky.

538
00:47:22,796 --> 00:47:28,301
Maybe he just wanted to show
us he was still the boss man.

539
00:47:28,343 --> 00:47:33,807
Maybe he figure... we was getting
too big for our britches...

figure his shit out.

It's no good.

It's no fuckin' good.
What is that stuff?

546
00:48:47,047 --> 00:48:49,049
It's something called beef treats,
which the army provides us with...

547
00:48:49,549 --> 00:48:51,051
so generously.

- Shit. I wouldn't either.

- What is this? Part of Logan's plan...

to try
and socialize these things?

552
00:49:04,064 --> 00:49:08,568
He told me himself they don't eat for
nourishment. What are we hoping for here?

553
00:49:08,610 --> 00:49:12,822
Hoping to satisfy the urge.
You see, Sarah, they're...

554
00:49:12,864 --> 00:49:16,284
they are us. They are
the extensions of us.

555
00:49:16,326 --> 00:49:21,915
They are the same animal, simply
functioning less perfectly.

556
00:49:21,957 --> 00:49:26,586
They can be fooled, you see? They can be
tricked into being good little girls and boys,

557
00:49:26,628 --> 00:49:31,591
the same way we were tricked into it
on the promise of some reward to come.

558
00:49:31,633 --> 00:49:34,052
[Moaning]
They have to be rewarded.

559
00:49:34,094 --> 00:49:37,597
Reward is the key.
I'm convinced of that now.

Come. I've got something
to show you.

That wasn't very nice, you know.
That wasn't very nice at all.

dark and think about what you've done.

Think about it.

My father was rich.

be rich doing pure research.

I'd never be rich.

Uh, Bub's been responding so
well lately, I致e let him live.
