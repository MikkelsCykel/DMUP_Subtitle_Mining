1
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:26,018
Can you see that area behind me
beneath the red-tinted sky?

2
00:00:26,249 --> 00:00:30,162
That is what's left of Raccoon City
after the military fired a missile at it.

3
00:00:31,006 --> 00:00:34,229
According to unconfirmed reports,
the missile was allegedly nuclear.

4
00:00:34,421 --> 00:00:36,799
If this is the case,
there's little hope of finding...

5
00:00:36,991 --> 00:00:39,523
...any survivors among
the city's 100,000 inhabitants.

6
00:00:40,406 --> 00:00:43,475
Mr. President, what is the connection
between Umbrella Corporation...

7
00:00:43,667 --> 00:00:45,470
- ... and this incident?
- No more questions.

8
00:00:45,662 --> 00:00:48,233
Was the missile launched
as a result of this connection?

9
00:00:48,463 --> 00:00:49,614
Can you shed light on this?

10
00:00:49,806 --> 00:00:51,839
The president has announced
his resignation.

11
00:00:52,031 --> 00:00:54,717
Umbrella Corporation stock
plummeted here in Europe.

12
00:00:54,909 --> 00:00:56,788
This dealt a blow
to the business giant...

13
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:58,899
...resulting in its
complete dissolution.

14
00:00:59,397 --> 00:01:02,083
The estimated number of bioterror
victims has skyrocketed...

15
00:01:02,275 --> 00:01:04,654
...from hundreds of thousands
to over one million.

16
00:01:05,191 --> 00:01:07,800
The president announced that
the Republic of Bajirib...

17
00:01:07,992 --> 00:01:10,792
...led by General Grande,
was the latest addition to the list...

18
00:01:10,984 --> 00:01:13,286
...of countries
that sponsor terrorism.

19
00:01:13,478 --> 00:01:15,857
- announced it plans to put
taxpayers' money to work...

20
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:19,540
...by allocating one billion dollars
for an anti-bioterror program.

21
00:01:20,422 --> 00:01:22,955
Pharmaceutical company WilPharma
issued a press release...

22
00:01:23,146 --> 00:01:25,640
...on establishing
a research facility in Harvardville...

23
00:01:25,832 --> 00:01:27,597
...home to 100,000 residents.

24
00:01:27,827 --> 00:01:30,551
We've taken every precaution
to ensure that a catastrophe...

25
00:01:30,743 --> 00:01:33,505
...such as the one suffered by
Raccoon City, is never repeated.

26
00:01:33,697 --> 00:01:37,496
Inflamed by Senator Ron Davis'
full support of the new facility-

27
00:01:37,687 --> 00:01:41,025
Dr. Curtis Miller, a longtime opponent
of the WilPharma research facility...

28
00:01:41,217 --> 00:01:43,788
...was arrested and charged
with obstruction of business...

29
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:46,473
...and issuing threats to proponents
of WilPharma's ex-

30
00:01:46,896 --> 00:01:51,116
Our organization has disassociated
itself from Dr. Miller.

31
00:01:51,615 --> 00:01:54,032
The human rights organization
Terra-Save has demanded...

32
00:01:54,262 --> 00:01:58,406
...WilPharma release the results
of their tests conducted in India.

33
00:01:58,597 --> 00:02:02,089
WilPharma stock fell sharply as
a result of scathing accusations...

34
00:02:02,281 --> 00:02:04,084
...hurled at them by Terra-Save.

35
00:02:04,314 --> 00:02:06,194
WilPharma must go.

36
00:02:44,254 --> 00:02:45,904
WilPharma must go.

37
00:02:46,095 --> 00:02:47,860
We say no. WilPharma must-

38
00:02:48,052 --> 00:02:52,119
Members of Terra-Save lie in wait here
in front of Harvardville Airport...

39
00:02:52,311 --> 00:02:55,917
...in anticipation of Senator Davis'
imminent arrival.

40
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:58,066
The group hopes
to confront the politician...

41
00:02:58,258 --> 00:03:01,174
...who will be attending the National
Pharmaceutical Conference.

42
00:03:05,356 --> 00:03:08,156
Now arriving in Gate 32A...

43
00:03:08,348 --> 00:03:12,031
...Flight 349
from Newark, New Jersey.

44
00:03:13,029 --> 00:03:15,906
Will a Brock Silverstein
please report to Gate 7?

45
00:03:16,098 --> 00:03:18,093
Brock Silverstein to Gate 7.

46
00:03:18,285 --> 00:03:22,007
Flight 89 from Columbus
has just arrived at Gate 17.

47
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:25,153
For those waiting to depart,
it'll just take a minute to de-board...

48
00:03:25,383 --> 00:03:26,918
...and turn the plane around.

49
00:03:31,483 --> 00:03:32,903
It's been ages.

50
00:03:33,095 --> 00:03:35,013
You look great.

51
00:03:36,356 --> 00:03:37,315
You look tired.

52
00:03:37,507 --> 00:03:40,998
Blame my new boyfriend,
he won't let me get any sleep.

53
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:44,375
Boyfriend, huh? Is that what
you're calling the W.H.O. report now?

54
00:03:44,566 --> 00:03:46,638
FDA, actually.

55
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,441
Aunt. I'm tired.

56
00:03:48,633 --> 00:03:49,593
Yes, I'm sorry.

57
00:03:49,784 --> 00:03:52,930
Stay here, and I'll bring the limousine
around as quickly as I can.

58
00:03:53,161 --> 00:03:54,580
Will you watch Rani for a minute?

59
00:03:54,772 --> 00:03:56,921
- Sure thing.
- I'll be right back.

60
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:59,721
Well, we should
introduce ourselves.

61
00:03:59,913 --> 00:04:01,026
I'm Claire Redfield.

62
00:04:01,256 --> 00:04:03,136
- You can call me Claire.
- I'm Rani.

63
00:04:03,366 --> 00:04:06,205
Nice to meet you, Rani.
That's a pretty name.

64
00:04:17,063 --> 00:04:19,097
Excuse me, sir,
are you feeling all right?

65
00:04:19,288 --> 00:04:21,207
Would you like me
to bring you some water?

66
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:26,540
It's urgent I reach Frederic Downing
from WilPharma.

67
00:04:27,576 --> 00:04:28,650
Emergency.

68
00:04:33,484 --> 00:04:36,170
We say no. WilPharma must go.

69
00:04:39,393 --> 00:04:41,196
Do you work for Terra-Save too?

70
00:04:41,388 --> 00:04:42,731
Yep. Just like your aunt.

71
00:04:42,961 --> 00:04:46,912
I like everybody from Terra-Save
because they're all pretty cool.

72
00:04:47,104 --> 00:04:49,598
You fight bad guys, right?

73
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,478
- Bad guys?
- Like him.

74
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:55,660
Senator Davis, you serve as a special
advisor for WilPharma Corporation.

75
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:58,423
After viewing photos of their
latest human test subjects...

76
00:04:58,614 --> 00:05:00,725
...what are your thoughts?

77
00:05:01,492 --> 00:05:06,403
That Halloween is celebrated earlier
in India than in the U.S., maybe?

78
00:05:08,091 --> 00:05:11,889
Really, I simply don't understand
American humor.

79
00:05:12,848 --> 00:05:15,074
Apologies. I didn't mean to-

80
00:05:15,266 --> 00:05:17,030
Don't worry about it. I can relate.

81
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:20,292
Are you two waiting for someone
as well?

82
00:05:20,483 --> 00:05:21,443
Yeah.

83
00:05:21,634 --> 00:05:24,282
Well, I think the asylum let
the patients out for the day.

84
00:05:24,474 --> 00:05:26,085
It's a bit crazy outside.

85
00:05:26,277 --> 00:05:27,543
That's an understatement.

86
00:05:27,735 --> 00:05:30,190
The Air Dome Research Facility
isn't the only thing...

87
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,684
...Senator Davis
brought to Harvardville.

88
00:05:32,876 --> 00:05:35,984
It's like the wacko circus hit town.

89
00:05:37,365 --> 00:05:39,015
Well, I-

90
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:42,046
I'm weary of waiting.
I'm going to grab a taxi.

91
00:05:42,237 --> 00:05:44,578
Good day, ladies.

92
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:53,249
Who the hell let it leak out
that I was coming?

93
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,817
Now those damned agitators
are out there stirring up trouble.

94
00:05:57,047 --> 00:06:00,538
I don't need this.
Get them out of here.

95
00:06:03,761 --> 00:06:06,063
What tar pit did this crap
ooze out of?

96
00:06:06,255 --> 00:06:07,982
I'm sorry, I'll get you another.

97
00:06:08,173 --> 00:06:10,936
I don't care what it takes,
just get rid of them now.

98
00:06:11,128 --> 00:06:12,969
Arrest them if you have to.

99
00:06:13,161 --> 00:06:15,501
But, sir, we don't have
any grounds for arrest.

100
00:06:15,693 --> 00:06:17,650
They haven't done
anything illegal yet.

101
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,607
Senator, may I make a suggestion?

102
00:06:19,798 --> 00:06:21,985
We could slip out through
the regular entrance.

103
00:06:22,177 --> 00:06:24,594
No one would expect that,
so the crowd won't notice us.

104
00:06:24,825 --> 00:06:27,165
What? Hell, no.

105
00:06:27,357 --> 00:06:29,582
I am an elected official.

106
00:06:29,774 --> 00:06:32,728
I will not skulk out of here
like some whipped dog.

107
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:37,562
Now, I won't budge from this spot
until you get that swarm of vermin...

108
00:06:37,754 --> 00:06:39,442
...out of the building.

109
00:06:48,957 --> 00:06:51,413
The bad guy. Claire.

110
00:06:52,487 --> 00:06:55,134
It's him. The bad guy we saw on TV.

111
00:06:55,595 --> 00:06:57,244
Senator Davis.
Can I have another word?

112
00:06:57,475 --> 00:06:59,086
- You cannot.
- Please, senator. Please.

113
00:06:59,278 --> 00:07:01,004
Just one more question.
Why would you-?

114
00:07:04,112 --> 00:07:05,186
What the hell is this?

115
00:07:05,877 --> 00:07:08,294
Rani, wait here, okay?

116
00:07:08,793 --> 00:07:13,474
Did someone put you up to this, or is
this stupid costume your brilliant idea?

117
00:07:13,665 --> 00:07:16,121
Okay, genius,
you got something to say...

118
00:07:16,313 --> 00:07:18,385
...get it off your chest and move on.

119
00:07:20,303 --> 00:07:21,722
This is too much.

120
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:36,954
Ma'am, are you involved in this?

121
00:07:37,683 --> 00:07:39,985
Indirectly, in a manner of speaking.

122
00:07:40,177 --> 00:07:42,632
Then, in a manner of speaking...

123
00:07:42,863 --> 00:07:45,241
...you're coming with me too.

124
00:07:45,817 --> 00:07:48,925
- Now, wait just a minute.
- Chief.

125
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:06,113
Oh, my God.

126
00:08:06,305 --> 00:08:07,763
What's going on here?

127
00:08:14,477 --> 00:08:16,242
Stand back.

128
00:08:17,047 --> 00:08:18,889
Move, move, move. Out of the way.

129
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:20,193
Stand back.

130
00:08:20,424 --> 00:08:21,575
Move away from him now.

131
00:08:22,649 --> 00:08:23,608
Damn.

132
00:08:34,965 --> 00:08:36,231
Too late. He's dead.

133
00:08:37,727 --> 00:08:39,684
Let's get the hell out of here.

134
00:08:43,597 --> 00:08:45,094
Run.

135
00:08:45,746 --> 00:08:47,434
Get away. Hurry.

136
00:09:06,195 --> 00:09:09,034
Hey, wait.
Where are you going?

137
00:09:09,226 --> 00:09:11,336
Reporting live
from Harvardville Airport.

138
00:09:11,528 --> 00:09:14,559
A protestor demonstrating against
WilPharma Corporation...

139
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:16,976
...attacked and supposedly killed
a police officer.

140
00:09:17,168 --> 00:09:19,163
But now, that same officer
has just attacked...

141
00:09:19,355 --> 00:09:22,770
...Senator Ron Davis' bodyguard
in a similar manner.

142
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:25,225
Eddie, why did you stop rolling?
Wha-?

143
00:09:32,016 --> 00:09:33,666
Rani.

144
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,661
Rani!

145
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:38,999
Rani!

146
00:09:44,332 --> 00:09:45,329
Curtis Miller.

147
00:09:51,353 --> 00:09:53,079
Rani?

148
00:10:00,638 --> 00:10:02,671
Please. Help me.

149
00:10:03,515 --> 00:10:05,625
Attention all persons
inside the terminal.

150
00:10:05,817 --> 00:10:07,659
Evacuate the building immediately.

151
00:10:07,851 --> 00:10:10,421
Repeat, evacuate
the terminal immediately.

152
00:10:10,613 --> 00:10:13,107
This is not a drill.
Use all exits.

153
00:10:13,299 --> 00:10:15,678
Everyone evacuate
the terminal building immediately.

154
00:11:05,056 --> 00:11:06,629
No.

155
00:11:08,048 --> 00:11:09,353
No way.

156
00:11:15,798 --> 00:11:17,832
This can't be happening.

157
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:50,367
Local police have secured
the entire airport in a lockdown...

158
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:52,669
...and access into the area
is blocked.

159
00:11:52,861 --> 00:11:56,198
Authorities are not releasing details
and we have very little information...

160
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,388
...at this time.

161
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:00,380
However, according
to unsubstantiated reports...

162
00:12:00,572 --> 00:12:04,831
...a bioterror event has occurred
in one of the airport terminals.

163
00:12:05,061 --> 00:12:09,243
Senator Ron Davis is among those
who are confined within the airport.

164
00:12:09,435 --> 00:12:12,006
At present, his condition...

165
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,667
Give me a hand.

166
00:12:29,769 --> 00:12:31,419
I want to go home.

167
00:12:31,611 --> 00:12:34,911
I don't understand
why you won't let me leave.

168
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:54,861
Why can't we stage
rescue operations?

169
00:12:55,514 --> 00:12:57,854
Please, chief.
You've gotta talk to your higher-ups.

170
00:12:58,046 --> 00:12:59,887
You heard the 911 call, didn't you?

171
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,535
Come on, please.

172
00:13:03,264 --> 00:13:04,837
Damn it.

173
00:13:05,489 --> 00:13:07,944
What's the matter?
Chief Jackass again?

174
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:11,819
What's the status of the site?

175
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:15,311
Well, the entire airport
is completely blockaded now.

176
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:19,186
We were attacked by two people
that I believe were recently infected.

177
00:13:19,378 --> 00:13:20,337
But don't worry.

178
00:13:20,529 --> 00:13:24,596
We caught them and locked them up
in a task-force vehicle.

179
00:13:26,054 --> 00:13:30,082
But even so, becoming infected
by being bitten...

180
00:13:30,734 --> 00:13:32,844
It's like something out of
a horror movie.

181
00:13:33,036 --> 00:13:37,065
Those creatures rising up
out of their graves.

182
00:13:40,441 --> 00:13:43,319
Come on, I'm just kidding.
But seriously...

183
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:46,580
...do you think this WilPharma drug
has something to do with all this?

184
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,460
I don't know.

185
00:13:48,652 --> 00:13:51,145
Even if there is a connection,
that shouldn't kick off...

186
00:13:51,337 --> 00:13:55,251
...a spontaneous outbreak
of some creepy-ass plague.

187
00:13:55,749 --> 00:13:58,397
It definitely reeks of terrorism.

188
00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:02,579
That explains why the state Board of
Health hauled ass to get here so fast.

189
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:04,996
What do you think the suits
are trying to cover up?

190
00:14:05,188 --> 00:14:07,758
If I knew that, I'd have
a hell of a lot more clout.

191
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:10,904
The White House sent a special agent
to handle this mess.

192
00:14:11,096 --> 00:14:12,708
He ought to be here soon.

193
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:15,010
You can ask him.

194
00:14:15,201 --> 00:14:19,153
Ask all you like, but honestly, there's
nothing to discuss on that subject.

195
00:14:20,573 --> 00:14:22,645
Who the hell are you?

196
00:14:22,836 --> 00:14:24,409
Leon S. Kennedy.

197
00:14:26,174 --> 00:14:29,742
Then you're the one?

198
00:14:32,313 --> 00:14:35,421
This is one of the 911 calls
that was made.

199
00:14:35,613 --> 00:14:37,684
- How many are alive?
- Four, including me.

200
00:14:37,915 --> 00:14:39,372
One's wounded. The senator.

201
00:14:39,564 --> 00:14:40,984
Can you give me your location?

202
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:43,708
We're in the VIP lounge,
west end of the arrivals lobby.

203
00:14:43,938 --> 00:14:45,856
Listen, I don't know how long
we can hold up.

204
00:14:46,048 --> 00:14:49,463
Send help now before
those things get at us. Please hurry.

205
00:14:51,189 --> 00:14:53,108
Most likely, that call came
from here.

206
00:14:53,338 --> 00:14:56,638
We believe they're in the VIP lounge
for Atmos Airlines.

207
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:59,668
Right now, the airport police
and state Board of Health...

208
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,050
...are the first responders.

209
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,620
They've completely shut down
the main entrance here...

210
00:15:03,812 --> 00:15:06,268
...and the two side entrances
here and here.

211
00:15:06,498 --> 00:15:09,337
There are no other routes
into the terminal building.

212
00:15:09,529 --> 00:15:11,831
We believe our best bet
is to fly in by helicopter...

213
00:15:12,023 --> 00:15:13,327
...and enter through the roof.

214
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,665
- The team should be comprised-
- I'll take the two of you. No one else.

215
00:15:16,857 --> 00:15:18,353
What? Why?

216
00:15:18,545 --> 00:15:21,461
Because I don't care to risk increasing
the number of infectees.

217
00:15:21,653 --> 00:15:25,144
You don't want to be forced
to shoot your friends, do you?

218
00:15:25,336 --> 00:15:29,057
Hey. Hey. Hold on a second.
You can't be serious.

219
00:15:29,825 --> 00:15:32,319
Who does this guy think he is?
He doesn't look military.

220
00:15:32,549 --> 00:15:35,311
He's the special agent
assigned to this incident.

221
00:15:35,503 --> 00:15:38,918
Let's just see what he can do.

222
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,092
Those infected with this virus
will attack other people...

223
00:15:46,284 --> 00:15:48,126
...anyone, without exception.

224
00:15:49,085 --> 00:15:52,730
The people that are bitten become
infected and go on to attack others.

225
00:15:52,922 --> 00:15:56,451
The only way to stop the infection
is to destroy the infectees' brains.

226
00:15:56,682 --> 00:15:59,175
Destroy their brains?

227
00:16:00,211 --> 00:16:02,015
Shoot them in the head.

228
00:16:04,739 --> 00:16:06,235
We're here.

229
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:38,162
The song of the infected.

230
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:40,809
Wait.

231
00:18:06,898 --> 00:18:08,663
Are you okay?

232
00:18:10,121 --> 00:18:11,196
Take it easy.

233
00:18:11,387 --> 00:18:13,152
Help is on the way.

234
00:18:17,411 --> 00:18:19,214
What the hell are you doing?

235
00:18:19,406 --> 00:18:21,056
Look.

236
00:18:53,821 --> 00:18:56,622
Stop or I'll shoot.

237
00:19:10,626 --> 00:19:11,968
That's impossible.

238
00:19:13,925 --> 00:19:14,923
Angela.

239
00:19:28,351 --> 00:19:29,310
You like that, huh?

240
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:31,536
- You want some of this? Get off.
- Stop, enough.

241
00:19:31,727 --> 00:19:34,298
Yeah, come on. Yeah!

242
00:19:38,518 --> 00:19:40,398
- That's enough. Stop.
- Get off.

243
00:19:44,504 --> 00:19:45,923
Freaks.

244
00:19:46,844 --> 00:19:48,417
Yeah.

245
00:19:57,702 --> 00:19:59,236
Hey.

246
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:15,888
What the hell, man?

247
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:18,765
I shot her point blank.
There's no way I could've missed her.

248
00:20:18,957 --> 00:20:23,177
I told you. The only way to stop them
is to shoot them in the head.

249
00:20:23,369 --> 00:20:24,827
It's their only vulnerable spot.

250
00:20:25,019 --> 00:20:28,894
Don't forget it, otherwise
you'll waste time and ammunition.

251
00:20:29,086 --> 00:20:31,349
And that can prove to be fatal.

252
00:20:39,598 --> 00:20:41,286
Let's go.

253
00:20:53,027 --> 00:20:55,060
- Those were gunshots.
- They sent help.

254
00:20:55,252 --> 00:20:56,710
We're gonna get out of here.

255
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,245
You should thank me.

256
00:20:58,436 --> 00:21:01,774
If you hadn't told them I was here,
they would've ignored your call.

257
00:21:02,004 --> 00:21:04,000
You might want to stick your ego
up your ass...

258
00:21:04,191 --> 00:21:07,222
...considering your own secretary
left you here to die.

259
00:21:09,486 --> 00:21:10,407
What was that?

260
00:21:10,637 --> 00:21:12,095
Someone who isn't infected.

261
00:21:12,287 --> 00:21:14,167
We have to help.

262
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:16,277
It's too late.
There's nothing we can do.

263
00:21:16,469 --> 00:21:20,497
That's right.
I mean, if you, then I leave too.

264
00:21:20,727 --> 00:21:22,454
No, Claire, don't go.

265
00:21:22,646 --> 00:21:25,523
When my father left,
he said the same thing.

266
00:21:25,715 --> 00:21:27,787
He said he was going
to go help my mother...

267
00:21:28,017 --> 00:21:30,741
...but he didn't come back,
and neither did she.

268
00:21:30,933 --> 00:21:33,465
And if you leave,
you won't come back either.

269
00:21:33,657 --> 00:21:34,885
It's okay.

270
00:21:35,077 --> 00:21:36,765
I am gonna come back.

271
00:21:36,957 --> 00:21:40,103
- I promise.
- Really?

272
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:44,400
By the way, do we have anything here
that can be used as a weapon?

273
00:22:08,648 --> 00:22:10,911
Never saw this coming.

274
00:22:22,498 --> 00:22:24,647
Is there anyone there?

275
00:22:30,517 --> 00:22:32,742
No answer. Never a good sign.

276
00:22:51,733 --> 00:22:53,422
Get down.

277
00:23:00,174 --> 00:23:01,709
Leon.

278
00:23:02,591 --> 00:23:05,239
- What are you doing here?
- I could ask you the same thing.

279
00:23:05,776 --> 00:23:07,579
You're the one?

280
00:23:11,032 --> 00:23:12,183
Is this it?

281
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:14,754
- Yup.
- Reinforcements?

282
00:23:14,945 --> 00:23:16,518
None. We're getting out alone.

283
00:23:17,094 --> 00:23:21,122
Is it too much to hope
you at least have some sort of a plan?

284
00:23:21,314 --> 00:23:24,192
- We're gonna run across the lobby.
- Are you insane?

285
00:23:24,384 --> 00:23:26,225
The lobby is crawling
with those creatures.

286
00:23:26,417 --> 00:23:27,606
It's also the widest area.

287
00:23:27,798 --> 00:23:30,100
It's too dangerous
to take the long way around.

288
00:23:30,292 --> 00:23:31,251
He's right.

289
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:35,203
They aren't fast.
We can get by them.

290
00:23:35,395 --> 00:23:36,316
Oh, yeah?

291
00:23:36,546 --> 00:23:38,272
And since when
did the NGO member...

292
00:23:38,464 --> 00:23:40,306
...become such an authority
on the subject?

293
00:23:40,498 --> 00:23:42,608
She's one of the rare survivors
of Raccoon City.

294
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,524
She has more experience
with this kind of hellish nightmare...

295
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:47,557
...than anyone else here.

296
00:23:47,787 --> 00:23:49,591
Hey, Raccoon City,
isn't that where the-?

297
00:23:49,782 --> 00:23:51,202
Yes.

298
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:05,129
Run.

299
00:24:15,411 --> 00:24:17,407
Keep up with me, Rani.

300
00:24:19,363 --> 00:24:21,780
- Go.
- Thanks.

301
00:24:28,571 --> 00:24:29,761
Senator.

302
00:24:36,628 --> 00:24:38,240
Sir.

303
00:24:47,409 --> 00:24:49,213
Greg.

304
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:59,034
Shit.

305
00:24:59,226 --> 00:25:00,646
He got bit.

306
00:25:00,876 --> 00:25:03,063
He damn well got bit.

307
00:25:03,255 --> 00:25:04,943
Stay back.

308
00:25:06,516 --> 00:25:07,974
Go on without me.

309
00:25:08,166 --> 00:25:09,931
- Greg. Wait.
- Greg.

310
00:25:10,122 --> 00:25:11,082
You got this?

311
00:25:12,885 --> 00:25:14,228
Greg.

312
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:17,335
Greg. No.

313
00:25:17,527 --> 00:25:19,215
Greg.

314
00:25:19,407 --> 00:25:21,748
Greg!

315
00:25:30,956 --> 00:25:32,605
You okay?

316
00:25:33,795 --> 00:25:36,442
Do I look like I'm okay?

317
00:25:45,957 --> 00:25:47,568
Are we going to make it out of here?

318
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,830
We have a clear view
and a straight path to the exit.

319
00:25:55,357 --> 00:25:56,930
We'll take out as many as we can...

320
00:25:59,155 --> 00:26:00,767
...and run like hell.

321
00:26:00,958 --> 00:26:02,340
Angela, back me up.

322
00:26:04,335 --> 00:26:05,831
Got it.

323
00:26:15,001 --> 00:26:17,149
Can't you get rid of them any faster?

324
00:26:17,341 --> 00:26:19,336
They're starting to gather over here.

325
00:26:22,751 --> 00:26:24,477
We're not gonna make it out,
are we?

326
00:26:24,669 --> 00:26:25,935
It's getting tough.

327
00:26:26,127 --> 00:26:27,355
We gotta go.

328
00:26:58,624 --> 00:27:00,274
Rani.

329
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:22,488
Claire.

330
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:43,091
You all right?

331
00:27:43,781 --> 00:27:45,393
Barely.

332
00:27:46,697 --> 00:27:49,421
- Rani, are you okay?
- Claire.

333
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:54,639
Let's go.

334
00:28:06,993 --> 00:28:08,643
Thank you.

335
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:16,930
Where's the senator?

336
00:28:26,254 --> 00:28:27,443
Finally.

337
00:28:27,635 --> 00:28:29,169
I'm over here.

338
00:28:37,802 --> 00:28:40,257
The light. Run towards the light.

339
00:29:00,592 --> 00:29:02,357
Get that perimeter set up. Move.

340
00:29:02,548 --> 00:29:04,467
Don't stand there, man. Set it up.

341
00:29:07,498 --> 00:29:08,956
Move in, move in. Open fire.

342
00:29:09,148 --> 00:29:11,718
- Light them up, boys. Light them up.
- Get a move on.

343
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:13,214
Move, move.

344
00:29:17,627 --> 00:29:19,698
Rani!

345
00:29:20,696 --> 00:29:22,422
Rani.

346
00:29:22,614 --> 00:29:24,302
Aunt.

347
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:29,444
- Aunt.
- Oh, my God. You're all right.

348
00:29:29,635 --> 00:29:31,746
I was so scared.

349
00:29:33,856 --> 00:29:35,582
Aunt.

350
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:36,848
Aunt.

351
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,035
They were everywhere.

352
00:29:39,227 --> 00:29:42,181
- I didn't think I would see you again.
- I can't stand kids.

353
00:29:42,373 --> 00:29:44,599
They're a real pain in the ass.

354
00:29:45,903 --> 00:29:49,011
Oh, my poor darling.

355
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:50,737
Bastard.

356
00:29:50,967 --> 00:29:52,464
That girl will have nightmares...

357
00:29:52,656 --> 00:29:54,689
...for the rest of her life
because of you.

358
00:29:54,881 --> 00:29:58,180
Let me go. Give her to me. Please.

359
00:29:58,372 --> 00:29:59,485
I got it, I got it.

360
00:29:59,677 --> 00:30:00,828
Claire.

361
00:30:01,019 --> 00:30:02,132
You okay?

362
00:30:02,362 --> 00:30:04,818
Oh, honey, I know.
But she's fine, really.

363
00:30:05,048 --> 00:30:06,391
We just have to wait.

364
00:30:41,113 --> 00:30:42,264
No problem.

365
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:46,369
I'll take care of it.

366
00:30:52,431 --> 00:30:55,193
We can use that
in the worst-case scenario.

367
00:30:55,385 --> 00:30:57,227
I have no intention
of letting WilPharma...

368
00:30:57,419 --> 00:30:59,682
...end up looking like a savior.

369
00:31:28,304 --> 00:31:30,146
Hey, Hunnigan. I'm reporting in.

370
00:31:30,337 --> 00:31:31,488
I already heard.

371
00:31:31,719 --> 00:31:34,174
The Marines landed
in the nick of time and saved the day.

372
00:31:34,404 --> 00:31:36,092
I can't tell you how relieved I am.

373
00:31:36,284 --> 00:31:38,855
I'm amazed and impressed
you got authorization for that.

374
00:31:39,047 --> 00:31:42,730
- You must have pulled a few strings.
- Yes. Well, I have my resources.

375
00:31:43,382 --> 00:31:45,953
After I received confirmation
from USAMRIID...

376
00:31:46,144 --> 00:31:49,022
...that the virus used in this attack
was indeed the T-virus...

377
00:31:49,214 --> 00:31:51,055
...I submitted a plan
to the president.

378
00:31:51,247 --> 00:31:53,588
He pushed it through
as a special emergency act.

379
00:31:53,779 --> 00:31:56,926
Every Marine involved in the assault
was vaccinated.

380
00:31:57,117 --> 00:32:00,033
- Have the terrorists made demands?
- No, not yet.

381
00:32:00,225 --> 00:32:02,719
But the FBl captured a member
of General Grande's army...

382
00:32:02,911 --> 00:32:04,983
...in Los Angeles just moments ago.

383
00:32:05,174 --> 00:32:08,014
When we interrogate him,
he might give us some information...

384
00:32:08,205 --> 00:32:09,663
...that'll establish a link...

385
00:32:09,894 --> 00:32:12,311
...between this terrorist attack
and the one in India.

386
00:32:12,502 --> 00:32:14,498
Maybe we'll dig up a lead
on the whereabouts...

387
00:32:14,728 --> 00:32:16,608
...of former
Umbrella Corporation employees.

388
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,792
They've gotta be the ones peddling
the virus on the black market.

389
00:32:20,444 --> 00:32:22,746
What the hell is going on?

390
00:32:22,938 --> 00:32:24,780
Why are WilPharma drugs
being brought here?

391
00:32:24,972 --> 00:32:26,238
It's the vaccine.

392
00:32:28,233 --> 00:32:30,420
You. What are you doing here?

393
00:32:30,957 --> 00:32:34,218
He's WilPharma's head researcher.

394
00:32:36,443 --> 00:32:39,091
May I introduce Frederic Downing.

395
00:32:39,282 --> 00:32:41,623
He's the one who developed
a vaccine for the virus...

396
00:32:41,815 --> 00:32:45,421
...which you, in particular,
are so familiar with.

397
00:32:47,224 --> 00:32:50,179
You mean the infection
in the terminal?

398
00:32:50,562 --> 00:32:55,435
You thought that was
WilPharma-engineered, didn't you?

399
00:32:57,085 --> 00:32:59,310
Utterly ridiculous.

400
00:32:59,502 --> 00:33:00,883
An inoculation.

401
00:33:01,075 --> 00:33:05,909
That's what they've been working on.
A way to prevent further outbreaks.

402
00:33:06,523 --> 00:33:09,093
- But-
- Claire, it's true.

403
00:33:10,973 --> 00:33:12,623
- You knew?
- Yes.

404
00:33:12,853 --> 00:33:15,961
I didn't think its use
would be sanctioned this quickly.

405
00:33:16,268 --> 00:33:18,647
Then the human testing
that took place in India...

406
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:21,678
An attack by terrorists
that somehow got hold of the T-virus.

407
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:24,402
All the members of the group
supported by General Grande...

408
00:33:24,632 --> 00:33:26,819
...were infected,
so we don't know the details.

409
00:33:27,011 --> 00:33:30,003
The U.S. government obtained
permission from Indian authorities...

410
00:33:30,195 --> 00:33:34,185
...to administer the T-virus vaccine
to the nearby communities.

411
00:33:34,377 --> 00:33:37,830
A vaccine secretly developed
by WilPharma.

412
00:33:38,022 --> 00:33:39,173
It was a success.

413
00:33:39,365 --> 00:33:42,166
The infection rate
was kept as minimal as possible.

414
00:33:42,357 --> 00:33:45,427
Why the hell didn't you
break out the vaccine for this?

415
00:33:45,657 --> 00:33:48,611
If we'd been inoculated before
we entered the terminal, Greg would-

416
00:33:48,803 --> 00:33:50,875
Inoculation would have been
entirely possible...

417
00:33:51,067 --> 00:33:53,752
...had Terra-Save not backed us
into an adversarial corner.

418
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,970
Had we been able
to follow proper procedure...

419
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:02,615
...as outlined in the original schedule,
the government medical stockpile...

420
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:06,068
...could have been shipped anywhere
in the U.S. within 12 hours.

421
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:09,061
Oh, my God. Then...

422
00:34:09,253 --> 00:34:11,248
...it's all our fault.

423
00:34:13,243 --> 00:34:16,044
I wouldn't argue with you there.

424
00:34:22,029 --> 00:34:24,868
We just ended up
making things worse.

425
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,710
That's not true.

426
00:34:26,901 --> 00:34:29,625
The villains here
are the ones who used the virus.

427
00:34:29,856 --> 00:34:32,580
But worse than them
are the ones who made it.

428
00:34:32,771 --> 00:34:36,570
Seven years ago,
our lives were changed forever...

429
00:34:36,762 --> 00:34:39,371
...by the virus from Umbrella Corp.

430
00:34:46,890 --> 00:34:49,001
Umbrella collapsed...

431
00:34:52,415 --> 00:34:55,907
...but their viral legacy
continues to spread.

432
00:34:57,787 --> 00:35:00,664
I'm gonna scrub this virus
from the face of the Earth.

433
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:08,414
You chose the role of rescuer
rather than fighter, like me.

434
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:12,174
You chose a path that
your brother and I couldn't follow.

435
00:35:12,366 --> 00:35:14,438
You weren't wrong.

436
00:35:15,934 --> 00:35:18,198
Leon, thank you.

437
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,626
Hurry.

438
00:35:34,235 --> 00:35:36,153
Find some extinguishers.

439
00:35:36,345 --> 00:35:38,225
Clear the area
before the gas tanks blow.

440
00:35:38,417 --> 00:35:39,415
Let's go, let's go.

441
00:35:39,606 --> 00:35:41,908
Where's the rest of the team?
Come on.

442
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,942
- How do I use this thing?
- Help.

443
00:35:44,134 --> 00:35:45,745
Somebody help. I'm stuck.

444
00:35:45,937 --> 00:35:47,510
I'm coming, I'm coming.

445
00:35:47,702 --> 00:35:49,812
Hurry up, come on.

446
00:35:59,634 --> 00:36:02,243
- What happened?
- The trucks carrying the vaccine-

447
00:36:02,435 --> 00:36:04,353
How much vaccine is left?

448
00:36:04,583 --> 00:36:07,653
Everything we brought today was all
we were able to scrape together...

449
00:36:07,844 --> 00:36:10,031
...from vaccine samples
inside the company.

450
00:36:10,223 --> 00:36:12,372
And most of that has just been lost.

451
00:36:12,563 --> 00:36:13,945
Where's the manufacturing data?

452
00:36:14,137 --> 00:36:17,167
- You think they're after the data too?
- Could it be?

453
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:20,429
Why don't you tell us
what their demands are already?

454
00:36:21,963 --> 00:36:25,378
If you don't wanna talk
I'll just go directly to the president.

455
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:27,488
The truth.

456
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,330
Truth?

457
00:36:29,522 --> 00:36:30,903
They demand the truth.

458
00:36:31,095 --> 00:36:34,471
The viral weapon from which Umbrella
Corporation's T-virus was derived.

459
00:36:34,663 --> 00:36:38,384
They wanna reveal everyone from the
U.S. government who was involved.

460
00:36:38,576 --> 00:36:40,725
Was the government
really involved?

461
00:36:40,917 --> 00:36:42,873
The proof went up in smoke
with Raccoon City.

462
00:36:43,065 --> 00:36:45,252
Wait a minute.
The truth didn't disappear.

463
00:36:45,444 --> 00:36:47,899
- There never was any.
- Convince the terrorists of that.

464
00:36:48,091 --> 00:36:50,815
If they don't get that information,
what will happen?

465
00:36:51,007 --> 00:36:53,961
They'll disperse the T-virus
in every populated area in the U.S.

466
00:36:54,191 --> 00:36:55,342
The deadline is midnight.

467
00:36:55,534 --> 00:36:57,031
That's only four hours from now.

468
00:36:57,261 --> 00:36:58,872
And there's no vaccine left.

469
00:36:59,064 --> 00:37:01,021
Can we find out
who the terrorists are?

470
00:37:01,213 --> 00:37:04,397
I have a clue as to the identity
of one of them.

471
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:07,850
Right after the first infected victims
appeared in the airport terminal...

472
00:37:08,042 --> 00:37:11,572
...I noticed a man in the lobby.
His name is Curtis Miller.

473
00:37:11,763 --> 00:37:14,027
I know him.
He's one of those bleeding hearts...

474
00:37:14,219 --> 00:37:16,828
...protesting the construction
of the new research facility.

475
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:19,629
If the terrorists' demands
are the release of information...

476
00:37:19,859 --> 00:37:21,969
...on what really happened
in Raccoon City...

477
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:24,962
- ... then he might-
- It can't be.

478
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,064
Curtis Miller is...

479
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:33,978
...my older brother.

480
00:38:17,754 --> 00:38:20,095
My brother
wouldn't do something like this.

481
00:38:20,287 --> 00:38:22,205
He was arrested
for threatening WilPharma.

482
00:38:22,397 --> 00:38:24,353
He just demanded
information be made public.

483
00:38:24,545 --> 00:38:28,574
Unfortunately, the rest of the world
doesn't see it that way.

484
00:38:29,533 --> 00:38:31,873
If you claim he's not a terrorist...

485
00:38:32,065 --> 00:38:35,902
...why don't you bring him here
to explain himself? Now.

486
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:07,209
You're sure packing a lot of hardware
just to go see your brother.

487
00:39:15,228 --> 00:39:16,839
Where are you going?

488
00:39:17,031 --> 00:39:19,563
I'm going to the office
and check on the development data.

489
00:39:19,755 --> 00:39:24,282
Can I help you with something?
Don't worry. I'm not scheming...

490
00:39:24,474 --> 00:39:28,042
...to infiltrate your organization
for my own devious purposes.

491
00:39:28,234 --> 00:39:31,342
I'm afraid there's only one thing
you can do.

492
00:39:32,032 --> 00:39:34,987
Join me for a late afternoon tea.

493
00:39:39,974 --> 00:39:45,192
There you are. Comfortable?
It'll be nice to have some company.

494
00:40:18,418 --> 00:40:20,835
This is the road to Curtis' home.

495
00:41:19,766 --> 00:41:23,143
I haven't heard a word from Curtis
in three years.

496
00:41:25,061 --> 00:41:29,051
He lost his wife and child
in the Raccoon City tragedy.

497
00:42:02,814 --> 00:42:04,886
That's odd. It won't accept my card.

498
00:42:05,116 --> 00:42:07,725
- Has that happened before?
- No. This is the first time.

499
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:11,331
I'll have to use the master code.

500
00:43:08,076 --> 00:43:10,685
We're entering an air dome.

501
00:43:13,447 --> 00:43:14,483
The roof is supported...

502
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:19,547
...by creating a difference between
the exterior and interior air pressure.

503
00:43:45,829 --> 00:43:47,977
The danger levels in this facility
are assigned...

504
00:43:48,169 --> 00:43:51,008
...according to the microbes
that are handled in each section.

505
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,694
From the right,
the levels ascend from 1 to 4.

506
00:43:53,886 --> 00:43:56,802
The higher the number,
the higher the danger level.

507
00:43:57,032 --> 00:44:00,638
Rest assured, however, that there are
stringent safety measures in place...

508
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:04,245
...in the unlikely event
a problem occurs.

509
00:44:04,437 --> 00:44:07,468
If anything positive rose
from the ashes of Raccoon City...

510
00:44:07,659 --> 00:44:10,844
...it's that security and safeguard
standards have been elevated...

511
00:44:11,036 --> 00:44:13,414
...in order to avert
any future calamities.

512
00:44:13,645 --> 00:44:16,637
What about this zero area?

513
00:44:18,018 --> 00:44:21,663
That contains researchers' offices,
meeting rooms and the like.

514
00:44:21,855 --> 00:44:24,234
That's where we're headed next.

515
00:45:15,530 --> 00:45:18,293
This isn't paradise.

516
00:45:19,597 --> 00:45:22,743
This is what you came
to assist me with.

517
00:45:23,127 --> 00:45:24,777
Thank you.

518
00:45:26,772 --> 00:45:28,882
Smells delicious.

519
00:45:32,757 --> 00:45:36,785
- What are you doing?
- Checking on the development data.

520
00:45:43,998 --> 00:45:47,989
- Yes, senator.
- I figured you must be there by now.

521
00:45:48,449 --> 00:45:49,523
What do you want?

522
00:45:49,715 --> 00:45:51,480
Why did you bring
that woman there?

523
00:45:54,895 --> 00:46:00,113
You're not feeling sorry for her,
are you? That's not like you.

524
00:46:00,343 --> 00:46:03,220
Don't you understand?
This is our chance.

525
00:46:04,486 --> 00:46:07,325
Yes, I know.

526
00:46:07,517 --> 00:46:09,014
Yes.

527
00:46:09,627 --> 00:46:11,124
Yes.

528
00:46:12,121 --> 00:46:13,963
What did he say?

529
00:46:14,462 --> 00:46:17,493
Nothing of any consequence,
I assure you.

530
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,869
He said something to you, didn't he?

531
00:46:21,061 --> 00:46:23,977
He warned me
not to let you see anything.

532
00:46:24,168 --> 00:46:27,008
Would it cause trouble
if I saw something in particular?

533
00:46:30,921 --> 00:46:32,571
No.

534
00:46:37,674 --> 00:46:40,206
When I started out as a rookie cop...

535
00:46:40,398 --> 00:46:42,585
...I responded to a call
about a small child...

536
00:46:42,776 --> 00:46:46,613
...that was stranded on a sandbank
in the middle of a flooding river.

537
00:46:48,033 --> 00:46:51,140
I impulsively jumped into the river.

538
00:46:53,059 --> 00:46:55,015
The next thing I knew...

539
00:46:55,207 --> 00:46:59,428
...I was waking up in a hospital bed,
bleary and disoriented.

540
00:47:01,883 --> 00:47:04,492
They informed me afterward...

541
00:47:06,065 --> 00:47:08,904
...that I had saved the child.

542
00:47:09,249 --> 00:47:11,858
But three S.R.T. members
were injured...

543
00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:15,388
...while fishing my sorry butt
out of the water.

544
00:47:18,342 --> 00:47:22,793
Talk about depressed.
I felt lower than dirt.

545
00:47:22,985 --> 00:47:26,630
What was I thinking,
putting others in harm's way like that?

546
00:47:26,821 --> 00:47:29,891
Not to mention
that I could've been killed too.

547
00:47:34,878 --> 00:47:38,600
But then Curtis said something...

548
00:47:40,173 --> 00:47:43,089
...that made me stop
beating myself up.

549
00:47:46,389 --> 00:47:49,842
"If you don't try to save one life...

550
00:47:50,494 --> 00:47:52,988
...you'll never save any. "

551
00:47:56,748 --> 00:47:57,707
In the end...

552
00:47:58,781 --> 00:48:03,155
...his own words
came back to haunt him.

553
00:48:17,964 --> 00:48:22,722
Let me through. Let me through.

554
00:48:34,769 --> 00:48:40,524
There is something,
but Davis wants it to remain hidden.

555
00:48:46,509 --> 00:48:49,962
This is the G-virus.

556
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:08,570
You have that here?

557
00:49:08,762 --> 00:49:10,642
It remains a secret
even within the company.

558
00:49:10,834 --> 00:49:13,136
The government affiliates
don't know about it either.

559
00:49:13,366 --> 00:49:14,977
It was obtained
through special means.

560
00:49:15,169 --> 00:49:16,550
A group with which neither we...

561
00:49:16,742 --> 00:49:19,390
...nor someone in the senator's
position can be associated.

562
00:49:19,812 --> 00:49:22,574
You got it on the black market.

563
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:26,065
What did you plan on doing
with the G-virus?

564
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:29,710
Create a vaccine. But even the senator
couldn't adequately express...

565
00:49:29,902 --> 00:49:31,629
...the threat
G posed to the government.

566
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:34,967
The plans were shelved
and it remains in Level 4 ever since.

567
00:49:35,158 --> 00:49:37,077
The senator is a member
of the committee...

568
00:49:37,269 --> 00:49:39,571
...that decided
to bomb Raccoon City.

569
00:49:41,028 --> 00:49:42,717
I've gotta tell Leon.

570
00:49:42,908 --> 00:49:44,597
Wait, no. I-

571
00:49:44,827 --> 00:49:47,167
If you do that,
what's going to happen to me?

572
00:49:47,896 --> 00:49:51,311
You didn't seem worried about that
when you were telling me everything.

573
00:49:59,751 --> 00:50:03,166
Looks like- Looks like there's
something wrong with the server.

574
00:50:31,174 --> 00:50:34,090
I'm going to stop Curtis.

575
00:50:50,472 --> 00:50:51,623
Claire, what's wrong?

576
00:50:51,815 --> 00:50:54,386
Leon, get over here
to WilPharma right now.

577
00:50:54,578 --> 00:50:55,767
They've got the G-virus.

578
00:50:55,959 --> 00:50:58,414
They were gonna make a vaccine
like for the T-virus...

579
00:50:58,606 --> 00:51:01,445
...but Davis just called Frederic
and told him to get rid of it.

580
00:51:01,637 --> 00:51:04,515
- Is Frederic there?
- He just went to go fix the server.

581
00:51:04,706 --> 00:51:06,433
Or he may have gone
to dump the virus.

582
00:51:06,625 --> 00:51:09,157
- Couldn't be.
- Claire?

583
00:51:09,349 --> 00:51:11,958
There's a call
coming from inside the building.

584
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:14,030
Hold on.

585
00:51:15,756 --> 00:51:17,790
- Claire?
- Frederic? Where are you?

586
00:51:17,981 --> 00:51:19,554
- In Level 4.
- Why?

587
00:51:19,746 --> 00:51:21,204
You were
going to the server room.

588
00:51:21,396 --> 00:51:23,775
I saw someone suspicious
on my way and followed him.

589
00:51:24,005 --> 00:51:25,923
You need to get out.
There's a time bomb.

590
00:51:26,115 --> 00:51:27,496
It's too late to stop it.

591
00:51:27,688 --> 00:51:29,606
We'll have another biohazard
if this thing-

592
00:51:37,932 --> 00:51:39,505
Claire? Claire!

593
00:51:39,697 --> 00:51:40,848
- Damn it.
- What's wrong?

594
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:44,032
I don't know. We got cut off.

595
00:51:44,685 --> 00:51:48,675
Attention all personnel.
A system error has occurred.

596
00:51:48,867 --> 00:51:52,320
Terminate all activities immediately
and evacuate the dome...

597
00:51:52,511 --> 00:51:56,118
...until safe conditions
are re-established and verified.

598
00:51:56,310 --> 00:52:00,262
Attention all personnel.
A system error has occurred.

599
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:03,830
Terminate all activities immediately
and evacuate the dome...

600
00:52:04,022 --> 00:52:08,434
...until safe conditions
are re-established and verified.

601
00:52:53,898 --> 00:52:57,735
Attention all personnel.
A system error has occurred.

602
00:52:57,927 --> 00:53:01,380
Terminate all activities immediately
and evacuate the dome...

603
00:53:01,572 --> 00:53:05,063
...until safe conditions
are re-established and verified.

604
00:53:05,255 --> 00:53:09,322
Attention all personnel.
A system error has occurred.

605
00:53:09,514 --> 00:53:11,662
Terminate all activities
and evacuate the dome...

606
00:53:13,005 --> 00:53:15,000
...until safe conditions
are re-established...

607
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:16,573
Looks like sections are blocked.

608
00:53:16,765 --> 00:53:19,259
Let's split up. We can meet up again
in the inner garden.

609
00:53:19,451 --> 00:53:21,944
- Ready?
- Ready.

610
00:53:22,136 --> 00:53:24,131
Angela.

611
00:53:26,011 --> 00:53:27,623
You're not alone.

612
00:53:27,815 --> 00:53:29,119
We're together in this.

613
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:34,260
I know.

614
00:53:59,966 --> 00:54:01,577
Leon.

615
00:54:07,831 --> 00:54:09,826
What happened? Where's Frederic?

616
00:54:10,018 --> 00:54:14,584
He was telling me about a time bomb
he found in Level 4 when-

617
00:54:17,538 --> 00:54:20,300
- A nasty wound. We gotta get out.
- I'm all right. Listen to me.

618
00:54:20,492 --> 00:54:22,295
Curtis was here, I saw him.

619
00:54:22,487 --> 00:54:26,132
He came out of Level 4
where the G-virus was kept.

620
00:55:06,954 --> 00:55:07,914
Curtis.

621
00:55:09,065 --> 00:55:10,714
Angela.

622
00:55:19,232 --> 00:55:20,498
You're hurt.

623
00:55:21,073 --> 00:55:22,493
You need medical attention.

624
00:55:24,450 --> 00:55:26,560
- Why, Curtis?
- I couldn't forgive them...

625
00:55:26,752 --> 00:55:29,092
...for covering up
the Raccoon City atrocity.

626
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:34,003
I refused to let the government
rewrite the truth as they saw fit.

627
00:55:34,195 --> 00:55:38,262
So when I finally learned the truth,
I swore...

628
00:55:38,453 --> 00:55:43,211
I swore I'd make them reveal it,
no matter what it took.

629
00:55:43,403 --> 00:55:45,091
Curtis.

630
00:55:45,321 --> 00:55:47,930
But he also told me...

631
00:55:48,122 --> 00:55:51,230
...that I couldn't make things
any worse.

632
00:55:53,608 --> 00:55:55,488
Even if it was deserved...

633
00:55:55,719 --> 00:55:59,670
...there was no chance of me-

634
00:56:00,207 --> 00:56:02,932
Of me causing a recurrence
of that horror...

635
00:56:03,123 --> 00:56:07,075
...here in the town
where I was born and raised.

636
00:56:07,305 --> 00:56:09,415
That's why he left me.

637
00:56:09,607 --> 00:56:13,444
That's why he blew up this place.

638
00:56:26,872 --> 00:56:27,832
Wait.

639
00:56:33,970 --> 00:56:35,582
Nothing can stop it now.

640
00:56:38,996 --> 00:56:40,991
In a moment...

641
00:56:41,183 --> 00:56:44,253
...I'll reveal the irrefutable truth...

642
00:56:44,444 --> 00:56:48,435
...in my own personal way.

643
00:56:52,233 --> 00:56:57,067
And all of you
will be the very first witnesses!

644
00:57:16,941 --> 00:57:19,358
Go straight down this corridor.
Head to elevator AD-2.

645
00:57:19,550 --> 00:57:21,353
It'll take you to an outside exit.

646
00:57:21,545 --> 00:57:22,965
Got it.

647
00:57:23,156 --> 00:57:24,154
Claire.

648
00:57:24,730 --> 00:57:28,681
- Try not to get killed.
- Okay, ditto.

649
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:40,115
Move.

650
00:57:44,335 --> 00:57:45,294
No!

651
00:57:46,215 --> 00:57:47,980
Stop.

652
00:57:59,068 --> 00:58:00,641
Cease fire. Cease fire.

653
00:58:13,647 --> 00:58:15,796
The target became aggressive
and resisted capture.

654
00:58:15,988 --> 00:58:18,405
I deemed it necessary to open fire
and issued the order.

655
00:58:18,596 --> 00:58:19,901
The target was terminated.

656
00:58:20,093 --> 00:58:24,351
Warning: A lethal viral strain has
been detected in the garden sector.

657
00:58:24,543 --> 00:58:26,730
Commencing feedback.

658
00:58:27,651 --> 00:58:32,140
Warning: A lethal viral strain has
been detected in the garden sector.

659
00:58:32,332 --> 00:58:34,711
Commencing feedback.

660
00:58:36,782 --> 00:58:38,586
- Captain!
- You've gotta be kidding me.

661
00:58:38,777 --> 00:58:40,696
My men shot the shit out of you.

662
00:59:34,831 --> 00:59:36,750
My leg.

663
01:01:09,559 --> 01:01:11,439
Angela.

664
01:01:11,976 --> 01:01:13,472
Angela, get clear.

665
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:16,081
Leon.

666
01:02:18,811 --> 01:02:19,770
Somebody.

667
01:02:23,568 --> 01:02:24,988
Somebody pull me up.

668
01:02:56,717 --> 01:02:58,751
What is this?

669
01:03:01,743 --> 01:03:03,662
Anhydrous ethanol.

670
01:03:03,854 --> 01:03:05,734
Are we being sterilized?

671
01:03:08,227 --> 01:03:11,680
Not us, the building.

672
01:03:13,023 --> 01:03:15,517
Incineration will initiate
in five minutes.

673
01:03:15,709 --> 01:03:17,474
- All exits are now sealed.
- What the hell?

674
01:03:17,704 --> 01:03:18,970
We're still in here.

675
01:03:19,162 --> 01:03:21,310
Get all survivors
to the central rest area now.

676
01:03:21,502 --> 01:03:23,075
Move it.

677
01:03:28,101 --> 01:03:30,020
Come on.

678
01:03:44,331 --> 01:03:46,709
Warning: All exits are now sealed.

679
01:03:47,246 --> 01:03:48,781
Oh, shit.

680
01:03:48,973 --> 01:03:50,546
Come on.

681
01:03:50,738 --> 01:03:52,579
- We'll catch the next one.
- Right.

682
01:03:52,771 --> 01:03:54,152
We'll send it b-

683
01:03:54,344 --> 01:03:56,301
Go!

684
01:04:20,971 --> 01:04:22,007
Stop.

685
01:04:22,199 --> 01:04:23,618
You'll ignite us all.

686
01:04:42,188 --> 01:04:44,144
- Oh, my God.
- It's impossible.

687
01:04:44,336 --> 01:04:46,178
- He's still alive.
- No, no, no!

688
01:04:46,370 --> 01:04:47,712
No, no, no!

689
01:05:23,202 --> 01:05:25,849
- Leon.
- Angela.

690
01:05:26,962 --> 01:05:29,839
- Incineration in two minutes.
- No!

691
01:05:30,031 --> 01:05:32,985
- Incineration in two minutes.
- No!

692
01:05:36,707 --> 01:05:38,126
Run.

693
01:05:38,357 --> 01:05:42,040
- What?
- Run!

694
01:06:07,899 --> 01:06:10,815
Incineration in 60 seconds.

695
01:06:11,007 --> 01:06:14,613
Incineration in 60 seconds.

696
01:06:32,415 --> 01:06:34,871
It wants you because of
your blood connection.

697
01:06:35,101 --> 01:06:37,595
It sees you as a breeding tool.

698
01:06:38,669 --> 01:06:41,086
That thing isn't
your brother anymore.

699
01:06:41,317 --> 01:06:42,966
Curtis is dead.

700
01:06:47,110 --> 01:06:50,064
Incineration in 30 seconds.

701
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:51,215
Come on.

702
01:06:56,471 --> 01:07:00,155
Twenty. Nineteen.
Eighteen. Seventeen.

703
01:07:00,346 --> 01:07:05,142
Sixteen. Fifteen. Fourteen.
Thirteen. Twelve.

704
01:07:05,334 --> 01:07:09,056
Eleven. Ten. Nine. Eight.

705
01:07:09,248 --> 01:07:12,662

Three. Two. One.

707
01:08:19,497 --> 01:08:21,531
Oh, shit.
Now what's gonna happen?

708
01:09:37,458 --> 01:09:39,684
No. No, no.

709
01:09:49,007 --> 01:09:52,882
Level 4 submerge system
will engage soon.

710
01:09:53,304 --> 01:09:57,639
Level 4 submerge system
will engage soon.

711
01:10:06,963 --> 01:10:08,881
We need to go up.

712
01:10:12,257 --> 01:10:14,482
Disable the system.

713
01:10:14,674 --> 01:10:17,360
There's gotta be a way.

714
01:10:29,906 --> 01:10:32,285
I know what Leon would do.

715
01:10:35,738 --> 01:10:36,927
Right.

716
01:10:43,564 --> 01:10:44,907
There.

717
01:11:13,797 --> 01:11:14,718
Come on.

718
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:37,240
Warning:

719

727
01:13:23,899 --> 01:13:25,702
Curtis.

728
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:27,544
Run.

729
01:13:29,156 --> 01:13:31,534
No. No.

730
01:13:31,764 --> 01:13:33,721
I don't wanna hurt you.

731
01:13:33,913 --> 01:13:35,026
Please.

732
01:13:35,256 --> 01:13:36,637
No.

733
01:13:39,706 --> 01:13:42,622
All right, Curtis.

734
01:13:44,157 --> 01:13:46,574
Let's finish this.

735
01:13:51,101 --> 01:13:55,974
Warning: Level 0 submerge system
will engage soon.

736
01:13:56,166 --> 01:13:59,887
Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven.

737
01:14:00,079 --> 01:14:03,225

738

Three. Two. One.

739
01:14:10,975 --> 01:14:14,083
After the system verifies
there's no more virus in here...

740
01:14:14,275 --> 01:14:15,886
...the hole will close.

741
01:14:47,194 --> 01:14:48,690
Let me go.

742
01:14:50,992 --> 01:14:53,793
Let go of me, damn it,
or you'll fall too.

743
01:14:54,023 --> 01:14:56,363
You can't die.
You have to destroy these viruses.

744
01:14:58,819 --> 01:15:01,658
Please, Leon, don't try to save me.

745
01:15:01,888 --> 01:15:05,725
If you don't try to save one life,
you'll never save any.

746
01:15:12,170 --> 01:15:15,777
Isn't that right, Curtis?

747
01:17:02,398 --> 01:17:04,086
Are you okay?

748
01:18:38,277 --> 01:18:40,962
It recorded.

749
01:19:13,881 --> 01:19:15,454
Where's Frederic?

750
01:19:15,684 --> 01:19:18,715
Dead. No vaccine data, no nothing.

751
01:19:18,907 --> 01:19:20,710
The same as Raccoon City.

752
01:19:21,209 --> 01:19:22,283
What?

753
01:19:23,051 --> 01:19:24,010
Frederic said it.

754
01:19:24,202 --> 01:19:26,235
You couldn't convince countries
to invest...

755
01:19:26,427 --> 01:19:29,189
...in the development of the
insufficiently researched G-virus.

756
01:19:29,381 --> 01:19:31,300
What are you talking about?

757
01:19:31,491 --> 01:19:35,175
At first, I didn't suspect you were
connected with this terrorism.

758
01:19:35,367 --> 01:19:39,280
If for no other reason than you were
in the airport when the event occurred.

759
01:19:40,393 --> 01:19:42,541
But you had a motive
for causing all this.

760
01:19:43,193 --> 01:19:44,153
Stocks.

761
01:19:45,687 --> 01:19:49,140
WilPharma stock tanked
because of our accusations.

762
01:19:49,332 --> 01:19:51,365
You were afraid that the situation...

763
01:19:51,596 --> 01:19:54,281
...would turn out the same
as it did for Umbrella Corporation.

764
01:19:54,512 --> 01:19:56,929
So you needed an excuse
to use the vaccine.

765
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:58,924
Now, wait a minute.

766
01:19:59,116 --> 01:20:00,957
Yes, I'm a stockholder.

767
01:20:01,149 --> 01:20:04,986
And WilPharma should regain
the public's faith after this incident.

768
01:20:05,178 --> 01:20:09,321
But there's no way in hell I would
support terrorism to ensure that.

769
01:20:09,513 --> 01:20:12,889
First of all, what is the G-virus?
I've never even heard of it.

770
01:20:13,081 --> 01:20:16,419
I know you ordered Frederic
to dispose of the G-virus...

771
01:20:16,611 --> 01:20:17,685
...when you called him.

772
01:20:17,877 --> 01:20:19,949
I told him
not to show you anything more...

773
01:20:20,179 --> 01:20:22,481
...than you needed to see,
that was it.

774
01:20:22,673 --> 01:20:24,361
I doubt he knows anything.

775
01:20:24,783 --> 01:20:25,857
Leon.

776
01:20:26,049 --> 01:20:28,006
General Grande's
communication man talked.

777
01:20:28,236 --> 01:20:32,495
It seems that all of us, the senator
included, were fooled by him.

778
01:20:32,687 --> 01:20:35,372
Who are you talking about?

779
01:20:43,698 --> 01:20:46,460
- Frederic? Where are you?
- In Level 4.

780
01:20:46,652 --> 01:20:48,724
Why? You said you were
going to the server room.

781
01:20:48,916 --> 01:20:51,448
I saw someone suspicious
on my way there and followed him.

782
01:20:51,640 --> 01:20:52,599
You need to get out.

783
01:20:52,791 --> 01:20:55,054
There's a time bomb here.
It's too late to stop it.

784
01:21:00,426 --> 01:21:03,457
We'll have another biohazard
if this thing-

785
01:21:06,871 --> 01:21:08,943
It can't be.

786
01:21:11,283 --> 01:21:12,473
It's me.

787
01:21:12,933 --> 01:21:14,852
What do you think?

788
01:21:15,043 --> 01:21:18,420
Yes, per your request.

789
01:21:20,108 --> 01:21:21,911
As of now, General Grande...

790
01:21:22,103 --> 01:21:23,676
...only you will be in possession...

791
01:21:23,868 --> 01:21:27,167
...of a set
of the T-virus and the T-vaccine.

792
01:21:27,359 --> 01:21:30,352
Nothing would offer greater
advantage when negotiating...

793
01:21:30,582 --> 01:21:34,994
...with a country that wants to keep
the existence of this virus a secret.

794
01:21:42,437 --> 01:21:44,317
You needn't worry.

795
01:21:44,509 --> 01:21:46,965
I've anticipated everything
down to the last detail...

796
01:21:47,195 --> 01:21:50,341
...including my own
escape arrangements.

797
01:21:51,952 --> 01:21:53,257
Don't forget...

798
01:21:53,449 --> 01:21:57,324
...you owe me extra money
for the data on the G-virus.

799
01:21:58,206 --> 01:21:59,894
And one last thing:

800
01:22:00,086 --> 01:22:01,544
As a friend...

801
01:22:01,736 --> 01:22:05,112
...heed my advice
and forget about G.

802
01:22:05,342 --> 01:22:09,332
The stuff is wickedly volatile,
and it can't be controlled.

803
01:22:15,932 --> 01:22:18,579
Right on time.

804
01:22:28,286 --> 01:22:30,051
You were supposed to come alone.

805
01:22:30,242 --> 01:22:33,158
I just wanted to see your face
one more time.

806
01:22:36,650 --> 01:22:38,338
Don't move.

807
01:22:38,530 --> 01:22:41,062
I have the last of the vaccine,
and the development data.

808
01:22:41,254 --> 01:22:43,671
This is all that remains
in the entire world.

809
01:22:43,863 --> 01:22:45,589
The rest is gone.

810
01:22:48,735 --> 01:22:51,037
Yes, that's right.

811
01:22:51,229 --> 01:22:54,106
You two can appreciate the situation
better than anyone...

812
01:22:54,298 --> 01:22:59,478
...after your up-close-and-personal
experiences with virus victims.

813
01:22:59,785 --> 01:23:02,931
Mankind will need this.

814
01:23:12,407 --> 01:23:15,016
Wait. Please. Don't shoot me.
Let's talk.

815
01:23:15,592 --> 01:23:18,086
You're a smart woman,
and smart women like money.

816
01:23:18,278 --> 01:23:21,654
I can make you rich.
We'll split everything 50-50.

817
01:23:21,846 --> 01:23:24,915
I meant 70-30. I'm happy with 30.

818
01:23:25,107 --> 01:23:27,102
Please. Please, take it all.

819
01:23:27,332 --> 01:23:31,936
Don't- Don't kill me.
I'm begging you. Please, no.

820
01:23:34,123 --> 01:23:37,730
You're too pathetic to kill.

821
01:23:46,784 --> 01:23:48,472
- All units, move in.
- Yes, sir.

822
01:23:48,664 --> 01:23:50,774
Suspect has been apprehended
and is in custody.

823
01:24:33,131 --> 01:24:35,625
Frederic confessed everything.

824
01:24:38,234 --> 01:24:42,262
He was also the one that provided
the T-virus to the terrorists in India.

825
01:24:42,454 --> 01:24:45,677
He even acted
as the black-market broker.

826
01:24:48,286 --> 01:24:49,974
He stole the T- and G-viruses...

827
01:24:50,166 --> 01:24:53,005
...then escaped right before
the Raccoon City disaster.

828
01:24:53,197 --> 01:24:57,379
But Frederic decided he could
only sell them as a set with a vaccine.

829
01:24:57,571 --> 01:24:59,566
So he erased his past...

830
01:24:59,758 --> 01:25:01,369
...found employment
at WilPharma...

831
01:25:01,561 --> 01:25:05,666
...and gained unrestricted access
to their research facilities.

832
01:25:06,012 --> 01:25:08,659
He had the luxury of searching
for potential customers...

833
01:25:08,889 --> 01:25:11,268
...while manufacturing the vaccine.

834
01:25:11,958 --> 01:25:14,529
This is how he stumbled upon
General Grande.

835
01:25:14,721 --> 01:25:16,716
The terrorist incidents
were demonstrations...

836
01:25:16,946 --> 01:25:19,133
...staged for
General Grande's benefit.

837
01:25:19,325 --> 01:25:20,437
Sort of a...

838
01:25:20,629 --> 01:25:23,200
...twisted sales pitch.

839
01:25:25,080 --> 01:25:28,149
And my brother
was just a tool to them.

840
01:25:29,684 --> 01:25:31,794
He was used.

841
01:25:32,369 --> 01:25:35,784
This doesn't absolve Curtis
of what he did.

842
01:25:35,976 --> 01:25:38,393
But we share
something in common with him...

843
01:25:38,585 --> 01:25:40,311
...and that's his passionate desire...

844
01:25:40,503 --> 01:25:43,956
...to prevent any further tragedies
like Raccoon City.

845
01:26:12,309 --> 01:26:14,228
I gotta go.

846
01:26:14,803 --> 01:26:16,491
All right.

847
01:26:17,681 --> 01:26:19,484
Catch you later.

848
01:26:25,277 --> 01:26:27,081
Leon.

849
01:26:30,610 --> 01:26:34,140
Let's go diving together again...

850
01:26:34,332 --> 01:26:35,675
...sometime.

851
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:38,130
Love to.

852
01:26:50,254 --> 01:26:52,710
When did you two go diving?

853
01:26:53,208 --> 01:26:54,359
Don't worry about that.

854
01:26:54,551 --> 01:26:57,198
More importantly,
what are you up to?

855
01:26:57,390 --> 01:26:59,309
Need a lift?

856
01:26:59,923 --> 01:27:02,570
I have a limousine waiting.

857
01:27:02,762 --> 01:27:04,066
Claire.

858
01:27:07,864 --> 01:27:09,936
Next time
we bump into each other...

859
01:27:10,128 --> 01:27:11,855
...let's hope it's some place...

860
01:27:12,046 --> 01:27:14,770
...a little more normal.

861
01:27:16,459 --> 01:27:18,262
Definitely.

862
01:27:19,336 --> 01:27:21,370
Until next time.

863
01:27:54,634 --> 01:27:57,473
Senator Ron Davis
announced his resignation...

864
01:27:57,703 --> 01:28:00,926
...after being accused of insider
trading with WilPharma stock...

865
01:28:01,118 --> 01:28:04,494
...a company of which
he is a major stockholder.

866
01:28:08,100 --> 01:28:09,980
Next, in international news:

867
01:28:10,172 --> 01:28:13,433
General Miguel Grande
has suddenly decided to participate...

868
01:28:13,625 --> 01:28:15,659
...in a Central Asian
disarmament conference.

869
01:28:15,889 --> 01:28:19,687
But the real motivation behind
his participation is not yet known.

870
01:28:19,917 --> 01:28:23,409
Government sources seem to be
optimistic about the turnaround...

871
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:26,516
...and say that it is to alleviate
economic blockades...

872
01:28:26,708 --> 01:28:28,588
...while rumors state
that it is because...

873
01:28:28,780 --> 01:28:32,348
...his ability to produce biological
weapons has been removed.
