<i>and shit like
that, you know?</i>

154
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,290
<i>Who creates the jobs?
Where do they
come from?</i>

155
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,058
<i>The profits

for example,</i>

156
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:42,999
trickle down through
the economy in ways
l can't even comprehend.

157
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:46,163
lt makes sense.
l 'm totally vibing
you, dude.

158
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:48,866
Yeah, simple Reaganomics
apply to the production
of hemp.

159
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:54,641
Well, l don't think
that really qualifies
as Reaganomics, but--

160
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,341
What are you
talking about?

161
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:58,975
Just because
weed isn't taxed

162
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:02,214
doesn't mean
it exists in
some sort of,

163
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:06,224
you know, laissez
faire paradigm
or whatever.

164
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:08,283
Did you just
use ''paradigm''
in a sentence?

165
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,554
<i>Yeah, man.</i>

166
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:11,596
l mean,
what you do
is great and all,

167
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:14,030
God bless you
for it, but it sounds

168
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,830
like plain old market
capitalism to me.

169
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,563
lt's Reaganomics.
Trust me.

170
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:23,540
What about it
is Reaganomics? The
black market isn't taxed.

171
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:25,804
Listen, Jane,
you're fucking stoned

172
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:28,438
and l happen to be
very knowledgeable
about this.

173
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:32,917
Whoopee! You
own a U V lamp. Let's
start the revolution !

174
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:35,283
What the fuck do
you know about
economics anyway?

175
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:40,451
Well. . . l majored

in college

176
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:43,518

fucking Summa.

177
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,928

a thing or two
about it.

178
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:49,064
l thought you
were an actress.

179
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:53,894
Economics didn't
really work out.

180
00:12:57,543 --> 00:12:59,135
This is
where l 'll be.

Okay.

<i>Oh.</i>

186
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:21,924
Actually, my

192
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:38,275
Do not make me send
my associates
over here

193
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,215
to collect
the hard way.

194
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:41,651
You mean,

195
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,153
No, Jesus.
Of course not.

196
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:46,191
So you'll probably
just break my
arms, then?

197
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:47,953
Break your arms?
Janey, what
the fuck?

198

Hmm.

204
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:05,737
So, Jane,

205
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:09,938

206
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,642
Steve?

207
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:14,449
What about him?

208
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,919
He gives me
the creeps.

209
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,650
l think he might
be one of those
skull fuckers.

Oh my God !
You're right!

214
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,146
He's a fucking freak.

215
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,681
So, listen.

216
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:46,377
lt would be a shame
if you didn't pay

and in addition
to taking

the cash for
the power bill.

00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:10,127
Yep, that's pretty
funny l guess.

470
00:36:10,201 --> 00:36:13,227
l don't even know
what l 'm laughing at.

471
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:19,499
So, how much
do you think
you'd need?

472
00:36:21,812 --> 00:36:25,111
l don't know.
Like five--

473
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,445
Dollars?

474
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,348
Yeah, l need
to borrow $5.

475
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:30,785
Well, what then?
Like $500?

476
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:33,346
Yeah, that
should do it.

477
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:35,751
Really?

478
00:36:35,826 --> 00:36:38,021
Hey, if you can't,
it's no biggie.

479
00:36:38,095 --> 00:36:40,893
No, l can
swing that.

480
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:42,728
Really?

481
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,427
You're gonna pay
me back, right?

482
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:48,199
Absolutely.
Of course.

483
00:36:48,272 --> 00:36:53,175
My wallet's
in the glove box.
Get it for me?

484
00:36:54,946 --> 00:36:57,471
l may have
five C notes
right here.

485
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:59,641
That would be
so fucking great.

486
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:06,919
Nope. l don't
have it.

487
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:08,856
We're gonna
have to stop
at a machine.

488
00:37:08,926 --> 00:37:12,657
Why do you need
500 dollars again?

489
00:37:14,298 --> 00:37:15,287
Well--

490
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:33,247
l don't think Steve
would fuck a skull.

491
00:37:33,317 --> 00:37:35,911
Why do you
keep it in
the glove box?

492
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:37,215
What?

493
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:39,085
Your wallet.

494
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:43,286
lt's too thick.
lt hurts my butt
when l 'm driving.

495
00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:46,330
That makes
total sense.

496
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:52,334
Hey!

497
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:53,563
What?

498
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:57,039
<i>Oh l l've been
to that housel</i>

499
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:58,040
Which house?

500
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,474
That one back there!

501
00:37:59,543 --> 00:38:01,534
An old college
professor of mine
lives there.

502
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:02,442
Really?

503
00:38:02,513 --> 00:38:05,346
Yeah.

504
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:06,974
He was a pretty
good dude.

505
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:09,042
What'd he teach?

506
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,714
Marxist studies.

507
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:13,848
Marxist studies.

508
00:38:13,924 --> 00:38:15,949
Yup.

509
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:22,557
He introduced me
to some pretty
out there concepts.

510
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:27,093
Some pretty
radical ideas.

511
00:38:27,171 --> 00:38:32,575
So, were you, like,
seeing him?

512
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:35,945
What do you mean,
''seeing him?''

513
00:38:36,013 --> 00:38:41,417
Were you
seeing him?

514
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:43,214
Do you mean
like dating him?

515
00:38:43,287 --> 00:38:44,481
Yeah.

516
00:38:44,555 --> 00:38:47,319
Ew! He was a fucking
Marxist, man !

517
00:38:47,391 --> 00:38:48,915
Marxist?

518
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:52,622
Why would you even
ask something
like that?

519
00:38:52,697 --> 00:38:53,686
Oh.

520
00:38:58,102 --> 00:39:00,195
There's a space.

521
00:39:00,271 --> 00:39:01,067
Where?

522
00:39:01,138 --> 00:39:01,934
Right there, man !

523
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:06,774
Come on, dude!
We don't want
to be late

524
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:08,835
for that dentist
appointment of yours!

525
00:39:08,913 --> 00:39:10,437
U h, right, right.
Right.

526
00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:13,040
You comin'
or what?

527
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:21,916
Yeah.

528
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,856
So are
you scared?

529
00:39:29,934 --> 00:39:33,495
About what,
the dentist?

530
00:39:33,571 --> 00:39:37,371
No, l 've never really
been bothered by
going to the dentist.

531
00:39:37,441 --> 00:39:41,537
lt would freak the shit
out of me right now
if l had to go in there.

532
00:39:41,612 --> 00:39:44,479
l don't think
l could handle it.

533
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:47,381
l kind of like it.

534
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:51,478
l mean, it's not like
l 'm a masochist
or anything, it's just,

535
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:55,548
well, in a way, it
makes me feel like,

536
00:39:55,626 --> 00:39:57,059
yeah,

537
00:39:57,128 --> 00:40:02,191
my teeth are being
taken care of,
you know?

538
00:40:02,266 --> 00:40:04,894
lt make me feel. . .

539
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:06,493
prosperous.

540
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,738
l 'm sorry, were
you talking
about something?

541
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:14,209
U m,

542
00:40:14,278 --> 00:40:16,371
Oh, yeah.
Great.

543
00:40:16,447 --> 00:40:21,214
lt makes you
feel prosperous
or something.

544
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:31,958
l'm bored.

545
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:35,363
Ericson?

546
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,162
That's me.

547
00:40:37,234 --> 00:40:40,931
Okay, l guess
l will see you
in a little bit.

548
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:46,600
Till we
meet again

549
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:50,511
Okay.

550
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:59,715
He's not
my boyfriend
or anything.

551
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,451
J ust a friend.

552
00:41:01,525 --> 00:41:07,259
l n case you were
wondering what my
relationship to him was.

553
00:41:07,331 --> 00:41:08,730
Or not.

554
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:39,156
How's it going?

555
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:16,831
Thanks, Gina.

556
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:21,201
Oh ! Thank
fucking God !

557
00:42:21,272 --> 00:42:24,867
This has been
the longest, dullest. . .

558
00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:28,810
most uncomfortable
thing l can remember
ever doing.

559
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:32,246
l really thought
l was gonna die
of boredom.

560
00:42:32,316 --> 00:42:33,806
l gotta pay still.

561
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:38,048
Oh, come on.
Can't we go already?

562
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:52,124
<i>Hey, Jane. What time
do you think it was</i>

563
00:42:52,202 --> 00:42:53,226
that l picked you?

564
00:42:58,642 --> 00:43:00,269
What was that?

565
00:43:03,347 --> 00:43:05,679
Hey.

566
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:09,446
Why don't you come
over here while your
friend's talking to you?

567
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:14,415
<i>Young lady,
come here.</i>

568
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,221
Come here!

569
00:43:32,676 --> 00:43:33,870
Look at me.

570
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:37,580
Look at me.
l 'm not playing
games here.

571
00:43:39,316 --> 00:43:44,310
lt's really bright
out, officer.

572
00:43:44,388 --> 00:43:50,850
Would you mind
removing your hand
from your forehead?

573
00:43:50,928 --> 00:43:54,796
lt's really
bright out.

574
00:43:54,865 --> 00:43:57,561
What's your name?

575
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:58,602
Uh--

576
00:44:00,738 --> 00:44:02,899
Christy?

577
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:05,840
You don't
sound too
sure of that.

578
00:44:05,909 --> 00:44:08,469
No, it's Christy.

579
00:44:08,545 --> 00:44:10,638
Well, Christy,

580
00:44:13,017 --> 00:44:16,748
how come your friend
just called you Jane
a second ago?

581
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:25,028
Jane's, uh, my--

582
00:44:25,095 --> 00:44:26,960
religious name?

583
00:44:29,066 --> 00:44:30,795
Your religious name?

584
00:44:30,868 --> 00:44:33,462
Am l
under arrest?

585
00:44:33,537 --> 00:44:35,528
Why would you be
under arrest?

586
00:44:35,606 --> 00:44:37,733
Have you done
something l should
know about?

587
00:44:37,808 --> 00:44:41,904
No, l-- shit.
l mean, shoot!

588
00:44:45,649 --> 00:44:49,585
Sir, do you mind
opening your
trunk for me?

589
00:44:49,653 --> 00:44:51,245
My trunk?

590
00:44:51,321 --> 00:44:59,524
No. Wait, excuse me.
We called you
because--my car--

591
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:05,858
Now, Christy,

592
00:45:05,936 --> 00:45:12,171
am l gonna find
whatever kind of drugs
you're on in here?

593
00:45:12,242 --> 00:45:15,370
Christy.

594
00:45:15,446 --> 00:45:17,573
Chris-ty.

595
00:45:17,648 --> 00:45:20,515
Oh, Jesus
Christ, Jane!

596
00:45:20,584 --> 00:45:22,552
Yeah?

597
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:24,416
Her name's
not Christy,
it's Jane.

598
00:45:24,488 --> 00:45:25,921
l don't even
know why you're
doing that.

599
00:45:25,989 --> 00:45:29,152
<i>What do

600
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:31,091

00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:35,555
<i>to bring to my dad's office
but didn't because
he's an ass.</i>

603
00:45:35,632 --> 00:45:37,429
What's that?

604
00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:39,435
A tennis racket.

605
00:45:39,503 --> 00:45:43,234
<i>And that is a tennis ball.
l wish l had more, but
my dog eats them.</i>

606
00:45:43,307 --> 00:45:45,707
Jack head,
paper clips,

607
00:45:47,978 --> 00:45:48,706
shoes,

608
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,245
Hello.

H i.

610

You're a
little early.

611
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:40,286
Well, are you
coming in
or what?

612
00:46:41,765 --> 00:46:42,754
H uh.

613
00:46:46,336 --> 00:46:49,897
<i>Peter's not back
from the airport yet.</i>

614
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:54,205
So why don't you
just have a seat and
l 'll go get it for you?

615
00:46:54,278 --> 00:46:55,438
Okay.

616
00:46:55,512 --> 00:46:58,242
Would you
like something
to drink?

617
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:02,081
U h, do you have
any lemonade?

618
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:07,488
Oh, no. l 'm sorry.
How about some
orange juice?

619
00:47:07,558 --> 00:47:10,959
Yeah, that sounds
good actually.

620
00:47:11,028 --> 00:47:13,656
All right.
Are you hungry?

621
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:17,962
Well. . . now that
you mention it,

622
00:47:19,269 --> 00:47:21,533
l wouldn't mind
something to
munch on.

623
00:47:21,605 --> 00:47:23,732
You know,
like chips
or whatever.

624
00:47:23,807 --> 00:47:26,173
Well, let me
see what l
can find.

625
00:47:38,222 --> 00:47:39,814
<i>Here we go.</i>

626
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:41,482
Thanks.

627
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:45,661
What's with
the corn?

628
00:47:45,729 --> 00:47:48,323
<i>Excuse me?</i>

629
00:47:48,398 --> 00:47:50,730
Oh, that's
a photo
of Peter's.

630
00:47:50,801 --> 00:47:54,237
l suppose that's
his idea of avant
garde or something.

631
00:47:57,007 --> 00:48:00,067
How long
have you been
Peter's T.A. ?

632
00:48:00,143 --> 00:48:01,041
Who?

633
00:48:01,111 --> 00:48:03,341
Peter.

634
00:48:03,413 --> 00:48:06,177
Oh, you mean
Professor Harwood.

635
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:07,877
<i>Yes.</i>

636
00:48:07,951 --> 00:48:11,148
Well, for quite
a while now.

637
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:15,385
l guess it didn't
work out with
that other girl.

638
00:48:15,459 --> 00:48:17,586
l guess not.

639
00:48:17,661 --> 00:48:22,496
Well, it's very
nice to meet
you, uh--

640
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:26,361
Jane.

641
00:48:26,436 --> 00:48:29,701
Jane. l 'm Shirley,
Peter's mother.

642
00:48:29,773 --> 00:48:33,539
Shirley, of course.
Peter talks about
you all the time.

643
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:35,601
He does?

644
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:40,548
Oh, yeah.
Constantly.

645
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:55,622
l 'll just go and
get what you
came for,

646
00:48:55,699 --> 00:48:58,065
so that you can
be on your way.

647
00:49:01,638 --> 00:49:05,301
<i>That is where
corn chips
come from.</i>

648
00:49:05,375 --> 00:49:10,779
<i>H mm, maybe old
Professor Harwood
is onto something.</i>

649
00:49:10,847 --> 00:49:13,645
<i>He probably
really loves corn,</i>

650
00:49:13,717 --> 00:49:16,447
<i>and all corn
related products.</i>

651
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:19,318
<i>l mean, isn't that what
you're supposed to
put in a frame?</i>

652
00:49:19,389 --> 00:49:20,686
<i>Things you love?</i>

653
00:49:20,757 --> 00:49:23,885
<i>l'm gonna do that.
When l get home,</i>

654
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:26,691
<i>l'm gonna frame
a bunch of stuff
l love.</i>

655
00:49:26,763 --> 00:49:31,462
<i>Like lasagna.
l love lasagna.</i>

656
00:49:31,535 --> 00:49:37,371
<i>lt's so good,
and cheesy.</i>

657
00:49:37,441 --> 00:49:41,878
<i>You know who else
loves lasagna?
Garfield.</i>

658
00:49:41,945 --> 00:49:45,847
<i>Man, that cat really
loves lasagna.</i>

659
00:49:45,916 --> 00:49:49,784
<i>Maybe l should put
a picture of Garfield
in a frame.</i>

660
00:49:49,853 --> 00:49:54,415
<i>As a kind of shorthand
way of saying
l love lasagna.</i>

661
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:58,552
<i>That would be
so fucking inside.</i>

662
00:49:58,628 --> 00:50:02,826
<i>Or how about a photo
of President Garfield?</i>

663
00:50:02,899 --> 00:50:06,027
<i>Oh, shit. That'd
be totally meta.</i>

664
00:50:06,103 --> 00:50:09,095
<i>People would be all like,
''Jane, why do you
have a photo</i>

665
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:11,299
<i>of President Garfield
on your mantle?''</i>

666
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:15,072
<i>And l'd be like
''Because l like
lasagna, of course. ''</i>

667
00:50:22,252 --> 00:50:26,211
<i>Oh, my,
what happened?</i>

668
00:50:26,289 --> 00:50:27,779
Did you fall?

669
00:50:29,726 --> 00:50:32,854
Yes, that's exactly
what happened.

670
00:50:32,929 --> 00:50:39,528
l was reaching
for something and
l kind of rolled off.

671
00:50:39,603 --> 00:50:42,299
Well, are you
all right?

672
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:43,964
Oh yeah,
l 'm fine.

673
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:46,635
Are you hiding
from someone?

674
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:49,474
Of course not.
Why would you
ask that?

675
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:52,515
lt seems like
you're hiding
from somebody.

676
00:50:52,582 --> 00:50:57,144
l don't know
what you're talking
about, Shirley.

677
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:02,214
Well,

678
00:51:02,292 --> 00:51:03,691
here you go.

679
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:07,594
Great. Thanks
a lot.

680
00:51:07,664 --> 00:51:10,497
Now l 'm sure
Peter's told
you this already,

681
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:12,694
but he wanted me
to be sure to tell
you to take this

682
00:51:12,769 --> 00:51:15,567
straight to his office
and put it in the safe.

683
00:51:17,174 --> 00:51:20,837
Oh, of course.

684
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:22,970
Well, l guess
that's it then.

685
00:51:23,046 --> 00:51:24,343
Okay.

686
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:26,382
See yah.

687
00:52:26,109 --> 00:52:27,940
Holy fucking shit.

688
00:52:44,928 --> 00:52:46,225
Oh !

689
00:52:48,031 --> 00:52:49,020
Hi.

690
00:52:49,099 --> 00:52:50,361
Hi.

691
00:52:50,433 --> 00:52:55,894
l 'm just waiting
for my clothes
to dry.

692
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:00,605
Those are
my clothes.

693
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:06,707
<i>Right. l 'm waiting
for your clothes
to dry, so that l can--</i>

694
00:53:06,783 --> 00:53:10,685
dry my clothes.

695
00:53:10,754 --> 00:53:13,279
Where are
your clothes?

696
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:15,847
l n my bathtub.

697
00:53:17,794 --> 00:53:19,159
Excuse me.

698
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,394
Hey,

699
00:53:24,467 --> 00:53:27,459
let me ask
you something.

700
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:32,372
Suppose you had
a very rare--

701
00:53:32,442 --> 00:53:34,069
Let go of my arm.

702
00:53:34,144 --> 00:53:36,544
Sorry.

703
00:53:36,613 --> 00:53:39,173
We're cool.
We're just
talking here, right?

704
00:53:39,249 --> 00:53:40,375
Laundry buddies.

705
00:53:40,450 --> 00:53:42,179
Do you even live
in this building?

706
00:53:42,252 --> 00:53:46,484
That's not
relevant right now,
laundry buddy.

707
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:52,188
Let's suppose
a person had in
their possession,

708
00:53:52,262 --> 00:53:58,895
a very old. . .
very rare--

709
00:54:01,972 --> 00:54:02,996
book.

710
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:04,438
What kind
of book?

711
00:54:04,507 --> 00:54:06,998
A very
influential book.

712
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:10,513
A book
that has
changed history.

713
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:13,208
l have no idea
what the fuck
you're talking about.

714
00:54:13,283 --> 00:54:16,912
Hey, dude.
What's with
the hostility?

715
00:54:16,987 --> 00:54:18,716
You give me
the creeps.

716
00:54:18,788 --> 00:54:20,085
The creeps?

717
00:54:20,156 --> 00:54:21,851
Take it
somewhere else

718
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:23,358
before l call
the cops?

719
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:27,453
Whoa! Hold
on there!

720
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:30,727
lf you want
me to leave,
l can go.

721
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:31,892
Thank you.

722
00:54:31,968 --> 00:54:33,697
l'm going, dude.

723
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:35,567
Goodbye, dude.

724
00:54:37,874 --> 00:54:40,809
lt's always me.

725
00:54:56,059 --> 00:54:58,220
Sweet mother
of Christ.

726
00:55:01,331 --> 00:55:02,298
What 're
you doing?

727
00:55:02,365 --> 00:55:04,697
l 'm just,
l was trying--

728
00:55:04,768 --> 00:55:05,928
l'm calling
the cops.

729
00:55:06,002 --> 00:55:08,334
Hey, don't do that.

730
00:55:08,405 --> 00:55:11,169
l 'm gonna
give it back.
l swear!

731
00:55:11,241 --> 00:55:17,976
What use could l possibly
have for a musty
200-year old book?

732
00:55:18,048 --> 00:55:21,381
<i>Don't put me
on hold l</i>

733
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:23,248
Hey!

734
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:27,416
<i>She's getting away l
l will find you l l am
a Marine Reservist l</i>

735
00:55:52,782 --> 00:55:54,875
Phew.

736
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:05,453
No.

737
00:56:12,902 --> 00:56:15,496
Wow, do you
look fucked up.

738
00:56:15,572 --> 00:56:17,699
Come on, Hercules.

739
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:28,077
<i>Aw, cute pig.</i>

740
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:32,919
The truck bed's open.

741
00:56:34,824 --> 00:56:36,655
lt's headed west.

742
00:56:39,763 --> 00:56:41,162
To Venice.

743
00:56:44,934 --> 00:56:46,902
l don't see
the connection.

744
00:56:48,938 --> 00:56:53,739
Wait a minute.
lt's coming to me.

745
00:56:58,181 --> 00:57:00,308
Buzz.

746
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:25,669
lt smells like
sausage in here.

747
00:57:33,983 --> 00:57:36,281
Time for a
revised plan.

748
00:57:38,354 --> 00:57:40,754
<i><b>Number one :
Get to that
Hemp Festival.</b></i>

749
00:57:40,824 --> 00:57:45,454
<i><b>Number two : Try
to convince Steve
not to steal my furniture.</b></i>

750
00:57:45,528 --> 00:57:48,463
<i>Especially not
my bed.
Oh God.</i>

751
00:57:48,531 --> 00:57:50,624
<i>Anything but that.</i>

752
00:57:54,037 --> 00:57:57,097
<i><b>Number three : Once
l've convinced Steve
not to steal my bed,</b></i>

753
00:57:57,173 --> 00:57:59,835
<i>try to figure out
a way to return the
Communist Manifesto</i>

754
00:57:59,909 --> 00:58:03,902
<i>without getting arrested.
Possibly via the
U. S. Postal Service.</i>

755
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:08,474
<i>No, Global Express
is much more reliable.</i>

756
00:58:08,551 --> 00:58:12,453
Now that sounds
like an awesome
revised plan.

757
00:58:18,361 --> 00:58:21,592
<i><b>Next stop :
Venice, California.</b></i>

758
00:58:41,217 --> 00:58:43,811
<i>Holy shit l</i>

759
00:58:43,887 --> 00:58:44,546
What?

760
00:58:49,792 --> 00:58:50,816
Dude.

761
00:59:04,674 --> 00:59:06,642
Are we in
Venice yet?

762
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:08,199
Venice?!

763
00:59:08,278 --> 00:59:12,305
Lady, we, we're
in fucking
El Monte.

764
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:14,145
Where?

765
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:18,013
Do you guys
kill pigs here?

766
00:59:18,087 --> 00:59:20,214
No, that happens
way before
they get here.

767
00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:23,054
We keep the pigs
on ice though, until
we need them.

768
00:59:23,126 --> 00:59:26,095
Shut the fuck up.

769
00:59:26,162 --> 00:59:27,151
Albert, she asked.

770
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:29,425
Hey, fellas.

771
00:59:29,499 --> 00:59:30,989
Now you
did it.

772
00:59:31,067 --> 00:59:32,694
<i>What are you
doing on the floor?</i>

773
00:59:32,769 --> 00:59:34,430
<i>Who the hell
are you?</i>

774
00:59:34,504 --> 00:59:38,167
You know the rules, M ikey.
No girlfriends allowed
in the plant.

775
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:40,641
Oh no, M r. Spencer,
this isn't my girl--

776
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:44,669
l 'm not his
girlfriend, dude.
Believe me.

777
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:49,241
M ikey, Albert,
would you mind
explaining to me

778
00:59:49,319 --> 00:59:50,547
<i>what's going
on here?</i>

779
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:51,746
<i>U h--</i>

780
00:59:51,821 --> 00:59:53,618
l 'm here
to organize
a union.

781
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:55,021
What?!

782
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:57,924
That's right.
l always make
it a point

783
00:59:57,994 --> 00:59:59,928
to get to know the
workers personally,

784
00:59:59,996 --> 01:00:03,363
and these two gentlemen

me a little tour.

785
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:05,526
Albert, l thought
we cleared up

786
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:08,093
all that union
nonsense last year.

787
01:00:08,171 --> 01:00:10,139
We did, sir.
l was just showing
her the way out.

788
01:00:10,206 --> 01:00:15,439
Look, M r. Spencer,
is it?

789
01:00:15,511 --> 01:00:20,505
How much stake do
you personally have
in this organization?

790
01:00:20,583 --> 01:00:23,051
Well, not that
it's any of
your business,

791
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:26,054
but l 've got
a very generous
benefit package.

792
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:31,185
A generous
benefit package.

793
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:33,888
Listen to how quickly
the lackey adopts

794
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:35,590
the language of
his master.

795
01:00:35,665 --> 01:00:39,157
Ma'am, l am going
to ask you one
time nicely.

796
01:00:39,235 --> 01:00:42,727
Tell your people
that we are
not interested.

797
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:45,501
l 'll tell my
people all right.

798
01:00:45,575 --> 01:00:48,544
But first, l have
a little message

799
01:00:48,611 --> 01:00:52,980
for you to tell
your people.

800
01:00:53,049 --> 01:00:55,745
You tell
your people

801
01:00:55,818 --> 01:01:00,152
the slaughterers of pigs,
the profiteering cowards

802
01:01:00,223 --> 01:01:03,090
who dishonestly hide
their dirty business

803
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:07,687
behind a sweet, happy
logo of a cute pig,

804
01:01:07,764 --> 01:01:10,494
while they manufacture
misery and death.

805
01:01:10,566 --> 01:01:11,658
Ma'am.

806
01:01:11,734 --> 01:01:15,431
Please, sir, allow
me to finish.

807
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:18,906
<i>J ust look around you.</i>

in this warehouse
of death !

811
01:01:31,888 --> 01:01:35,085
And you have
the audacity
to tell me

812
01:01:35,158 --> 01:01:41,529
that you have
a generous
benefit package?

813

And them?

814
01:01:43,166 --> 01:01:48,798
Do they have
a generous
benefit package?

815
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:55,440
l think we all know
the answer to that.
Don't we?

816

lt is a tale

A fight that each
time ended

824
01:02:28,544 --> 01:02:33,982
in either revolutionary
reconstitution of
society at large,

825

or in a complete
and total ruin !

826

You tell your
people that!

827

You think you're
so, um, uh--

01:14:28,864 --> 01:14:34,029
<i>That her intentions
were honorable, that
there'd be no doubt.</i>

940
01:14:34,102 --> 01:14:39,802
<i>But what puzzled many
on that day was not the
virtue of her intentions.</i>

941
01:14:39,875 --> 01:14:42,435
Hey!

942
01:14:42,511 --> 01:14:45,742
<i>What puzzled
many was why.</i>

943
01:14:45,814 --> 01:14:49,215
Hey!

944
01:14:51,353 --> 01:14:54,584
<i>By what bizarre
and convoluted logic,</i>

945
01:14:54,656 --> 01:14:56,749
<i>did she arrive
at the decision
to do</i>

946
01:14:56,825 --> 01:15:00,022
<i>what you're
about to see?</i>

947
01:15:00,095 --> 01:15:05,158
<i>l n short,
what the fuck
was she thinking?</i>

948
01:15:05,234 --> 01:15:10,536
Whoa!
Hey!

949
01:15:10,606 --> 01:15:12,836
Up here!

950
01:15:12,908 --> 01:15:16,002
Brevin !
l'm up here!

951
01:15:22,885 --> 01:15:24,352
Oh no.

952
01:15:47,709 --> 01:15:52,442
Heyyy!

953
01:16:00,822 --> 01:16:01,720
Ohhh !

954
01:16:03,158 --> 01:16:03,817
Help.

955
01:17:36,118 --> 01:17:37,949
Whoa.

956
01:18:28,904 --> 01:18:32,362
<i>So, my dad plays
golf with this guy,</i>

957
01:18:32,441 --> 01:18:36,434
<i>who is a pretty good
criminal attorney.</i>

958
01:18:36,511 --> 01:18:38,706
l think he's
a criminal attorney.

959
01:18:38,780 --> 01:18:40,338
He's definitely
a lawyer.

960
01:18:40,415 --> 01:18:43,942
l could try to hook
you up with him
if you want.

961
01:18:44,019 --> 01:18:47,580
Yeah, that
sounds good.

962
01:18:51,626 --> 01:18:57,155
Well, Brevin, it sure
has been a fucking
day, huh?

963
01:18:58,633 --> 01:19:01,796
Yeah, l guess.

964
01:20:10,305 --> 01:20:14,071
What a weird
fucking dream.

965
01:20:17,445 --> 01:20:21,006
Hey, stoner!
Back to work!

966
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:27,250
Sorry.

967
01:20:27,322 --> 01:20:30,758
<i>This has been the story
of how a person started at A,</i>

968
01:20:30,826 --> 01:20:34,193
<i>got to Z, and
somehow ended up</i>

969
01:20:34,262 --> 01:20:38,164
<i>collecting garbage
by the side of
the freeway.</i>

970
01:20:38,233 --> 01:20:42,329
<i>And l think you'll all
agree that much like
life itself,</i>

971
01:20:42,404 --> 01:20:48,639
<i>it certainly has
been--one hell
of a crazy ride.</i>
