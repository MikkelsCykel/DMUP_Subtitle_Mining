1
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,880
Nice view.

2
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,400
Perfect timing.

3
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,720
Wait a minute. He's not alone.

4
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,560
That's heartbreaking news.

5
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,760
Pull the plug. A kid's in the car.

6
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,600
The drug lord's in the car.

7
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,560
Kid took a bad ride, that's all.

8
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,840
Abort the action.

9
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,000
You're the rigger.

10
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,840
I'm the trigger. I decide.

11
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,120
You just sit back and watch the show.
Okay, sport?

12
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,440
Activate the fail-safe, you psycho!

13
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,680
Here's a tip, Ray. There is no fail-safe.

14
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,720
Come on! Come on!

15
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,880
He'll never make it.

16
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,480
You're an arrogant man, Raymond.

17
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:08,280
I taught you everything you know,
and you dare to turn on me.

18
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,880
Gonna kill me too, Colonel?

19
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,840
You're a specialist, Captain.
You deserve better.

20
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,280
Don't forget to write.

21
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,320
You like watching her die?

22
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,760
Taking them down?

23
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,760
Now I'm taking you down.
You're finished in the Agency.

24
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,080
You're goin' nowhere...

25
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,440
...you're as dead as those people...

26
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,240
...in the river.

27
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,440
We both are!

28
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,880
Have you decided to take thejob?

29
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,560
I saw your ad today.

30
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,120
- I know it's late-
- It's never too late.

31
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,680
After all, you're giving me a new life.

32
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,160
Really? When?

33
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,360
When you kill those three bastards.

34
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,960
I'm flattered.

35
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,280
You better get somebody else.

36
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,600
I like your voice.

37
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,080
You don't need an explosives contractor.

38
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,280
Yes, I do.

39
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,120
- You're my only hope.
- Go to court, use the law.

40
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,200
The law's been bought.

41
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,480
Use a bullet.

42
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,840
Bullets...

43
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,280
...are imprecise.

44
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:32,480
I heard you control your explosions...
that you shape your charges.

45
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,040
What I shape is my business.

46
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,520
All I'm saying...

47
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,720
...word is you are the best.

48
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,160
Whose word?

49
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,920
If we couldjust meet...

50
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,360
I don't meet or work in Miami
and I don't do jobs like this.

51
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,760
Why do you keep calling me back?

52
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,200
Why?

53
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,360
I like your voice.

54
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,360
Is it my cologne?

55
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,760
They're killers.
You'd be doing the world a favor.

56
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:58,320
I don't owe the world any favors.
Why did you wait so long?

57
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,640
I thought...

58
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,640
I thought maybe it would pass.

59
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,640
Every day is worse.

60
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,840
Remembering what happened.

61
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,480
That's what I do instead of being alive.

62
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,520
My father hid me in the closet.

63
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,400
I could still see.

64
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,040
My mother suffered.

65
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,120
They tortured her to get my father to talk.

66
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,120
We're going to have to kill her.

67
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,800
He walked by something
he shouldn't have seen.

68
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,160
They covered his face
with the pillow from my bed.

69
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,040
Waste them.

70
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,440
It was too small.

71
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,120
So they shot him.

72
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,040
I never thought...

73
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,000
...blood would be so sticky.

74
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,560
Sometimes I think I can never wash it off.

75
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,560
The only thing I understand
anymore is revenge.

76
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,040
I'm going in, and I'm going to do it myself.

77
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,320
You'll only get one of them.

78
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,960
That's why I need you.

79
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,720
I don't do this kind ofjob anymore.

80
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,800
I know you've been watching me,
trying to decide if...

81
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,880
...I'm on the level,
ifyou're going to take thejob.

82
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,080
I can't wait anymore, I'm going in.

83
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,440
- They'll make you.
- I have an alias.

84
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,160
Adrian Hastings.

85
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,520
Wish me luck.

86
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,760
Señor León.

87
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,760
How's it coming in?

88
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,880
Oh, boy. You don't give up.

89
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,000
It's packed in Monopoly boxes.

90
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,720
That's great, Papa.

91
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,040
You get it in. I'll put it on the street.

92
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,480
Come here.

93
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,760
- How are you?
- Nice party.

94
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,400
You went all out. It's fantastic.

95
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,480
- So let's talk numbers.
- Forget business tonight.

96
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,200
Go grab yourself a nice mulatta.

97
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,720
I want my money.

98
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,160
An advance.
Small token of my family's goodwill.

99
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,360
Token?

100
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,320
Token.

101
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,720
Listen to me, boy.

102
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,800
You know what the Dark Ages are?

103
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,640
The Dark Ages are what I brought
the León family out of.

104
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,400
I computerized your operation.

105
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:27,320
I streamlined your security.
I dragged you into the 20th century.

106
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,680
So don't fuck with me.

107
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,200
What is this?

108
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:35,480
A tip? I don't work for tips.
She works for tips.

109
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,920
I want my money. I want it now.

110
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,440
Go get it.

111
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,360
It's always a pleasure working with you.

112
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,520
Champagne, please.

113
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,280
Is there something you want?

114
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,920
What I want, I take.

115
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,000
Champagne?

116
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,720
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

117
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,480
Welcome to our bank.

118
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,800
I've never seen you before.

119
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,160
I lived here when I was little.

120
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,360
A lot's happened since you left.

121
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,040
Like what?

122
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,520
Like me.

123
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,240
Insecurity is a terrible thing.

124
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,520
It would be.

125
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,200
I'd like to dance.

126
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,520
What's wrong with keeping
the conversation going?

127
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,400
Later. Right now, I'm taking what I want.

128
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,040
You look beautiful tonight!

129
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:58,440
I'll have my driver to pick you up
tomorrow and I'll show you my Miami.

130
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,840
Right on time.

131
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,960
Should I do it, Timer?

132
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,280
- Kind ofyoung to be riding the bus.
- Stop it!

133
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,000
What? I'm not good enough for you?

134
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,560
I wanna play.

135
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,120
Come on, baby...

136
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,920
- Stop! Leave me alone!
- Come on now, what's up, huh?

137
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,880
Here, you can take my seat.

138
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,120
Thank you!

139
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,560
That seat's taken.

140
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,600
Fuck you.

141
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,120
Excuse me?

142
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,800
Fuck you.

143
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,160
Hold these, please.

144
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,920
What's going on?

145
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,760
I hate knives.

146
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,800
Fuck you! You son of a bitch!

147
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,320
I believe there's a vacancy.

148
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,440
- What do you drink?
- Martini.

149
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,400
Martini on the rocks.

150
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,440
Gold tequila, straight up.

151
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,520
No one knows Miami like I do.

152
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,600
You like spending the day with me?

153
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,080
Yeah.

154
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,480
Do you?

155
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,880
Kiss me.

156
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,320
I hardly know you.

157
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,000
Wait 'til you try to spend the night.

158
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,600
Thanks.

159
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,080
Stay here. I must take care of something.

160
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,760
Got a light?

161
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,800
Is that the piece of shit?

162
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,880
Where were you?

163
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,080
Home.

164
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,920
Thanks.

165
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,840
What happened to you?

166
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,280
I didn't like the show.

167
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,120
You don't...

168
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,480
...walk away from me...

169
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,080
...ever.

170
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,880
You understand?

171
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,640
Sorry.

172
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,240
Get in the car.

173
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,680
Sure.

174
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,760
Every time...

175
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,800
...he touches me I...

176
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,440
I mean...

177
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,760
...he's the man who shot my father!

178
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,200
And he's...

179
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,600
...kissing me and...

180
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,240
Oh, God!

181
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,600
You don't have to do it.

182
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,880
It's the only way I can get
close enough to kill him!

183
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,680
You see, I have this dream:

184
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,880
I'm right there when it happens.

185
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,160
He looks at me like I'm a stranger.

186
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,320
And I say my name.

187
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:50,120
And it's the last thing he ever hears.

188
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,360
They don't suspect you?

189
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,680
I'm trusted, for the moment.

190
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,480
He's always with you. How do you live?

191
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,720
Alone.

192
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,840
That's not what I mean.

193
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,720
How do you live...

194
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,920
...with yourself?.

195
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,120
How do you?

196
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,680
Hey, you!

197
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,080
I'm talking to you.

198
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,560
You think you know me?

199
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,520
I asked you a question.
Do you think you know me?

200
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,320
'Cause the way you're looking at me,
we must be old friends.

201
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,000
Where did we meet?

202
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,520
Nowhere.

203
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,000
Nowhere.

204
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,720
You like the bitch?

205
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,920
Maybe you like me.

206
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,360
I don't like you.

207
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,080
Then don't stare so hard.

208
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,960
Somebody could...

209
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,920
...put something in your eye.

210
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,920
Fucking pervert.

211
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,000
Let's move it.

212
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,680
Good night.

213
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,680
Adrian.

214
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,360
Are you listening?

215
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,280
The first rule:

216
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,360
Don't go near them again.

217
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,840
Second rule:

218
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,080
Don't contact me.

219
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,360
I'll contact you.

220
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,960
Maybe I can help you.

221
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,960
- Let me see-
- No.

222
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,840
They're my problem now and I'm theirs.

223
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,720
Are you close enough to walk over?

224
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,440
Rule three:

225
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,440
If this is a setup...

226
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,320
...I...

227
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,920
...will kill you.

228
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,880
Now what?

229
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,400
That cop was a regular.
Juanita's moving in on me.

230
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,200
Get out of here!
I don't solve domestic problems!

231
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,560
Asshole!

232
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,920
Don't go anywhere.

233
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,440
I'll be right back.

234
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,320
Lucky me.

235
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,000
Hey, Charlie!

236
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,360
J & B.

237
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,080
The word is, Manny...

238
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,320
...you're skimming.

239
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,320
Somebody's lying. I never took a dollar.

240
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,480
I hope it ain't you.

241
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,200
Because if you're trying
to screw Joe León...

242
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,120
You've known me, what, ten years?

243
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,480
I'm clean.

244
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,760
Good.

245
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,320
Very good.

246
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,280
Then you have nothing to worry about.

247
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,000
Let me see the books.

248
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,160
That is it. What?

249
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,440
- How about a drink?
- Sure.

250
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,680
September's missing.

251
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,080
See you, Manny.

252
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,280
What do you feel like doing?

253
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,320
What?

254
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,000
I'm working.

255
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,200
You have two hours!

256
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,720
Get another job, kid.

257
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:11,280
They got two bodies in there.
Something that used to be Charlie...

258
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,200
...and a hit on your brothel manager.
That was a bright move.

259
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:17,120
Something you ordered?
Didn't bother to tell me?

260
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,400
He was a thief.

261
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,840
- Tell me about the bomb.
- Very clean.

262
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,640
There was no damage
left or right of the blast.

263
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:27,880
The arming device was impacted
inside the C-4, so it was vaporized.

264
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,240
Brilliant plan, totally professional.
Must be a specialist.

265
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,280
- This guy is good.
- Yeah, okay.

266
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:37,480
He could put a bomb in your crab shell
and you wouldn't even know it.

267
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,720
I'll kill him!

268
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:43,400
You can't kill anyone
until we know who he is, can you?

269
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,720
I'll find him.

270
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:48,800
The important thing to find out
is who he works for.

271
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,120
Maybe he's with the CIA.

272
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,200
Maybe he works for the Mafia.

273
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,720
But we have to find out who.

274
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,080
Overview.

275
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,560
What does eliminating Charlie mean
in the overall picture?

276
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,280
- Nothing.
- Less than nothing.

277
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,040
So this target wasn't territorial.

278
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,440
It was personal.

279
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,600
How the fuck do you know so much?

280
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:13,120
He's guessing. Let me take a few boys,
I'll find this bastard.

281
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:16,520
Wait a minute. Give me a second.
I have to make a decision.

282
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,240
Little time to think here, huh?

283
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,200
You take over, OK?

284
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:33,560
I said, Trent will handle it, OK?
I don't hear you saying '"OK'"...

285
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:34,760
- What did you say?
- OK.

286
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,680
That's nice. Thank you.

287
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,160
Fuck you.

288
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,400
I'll need resources on this one, Joe.

289
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,360
Also, the place was crawling with cops.

290
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,920
I can't be tripping over civil servants
every move I make.

291
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,480
I need total control.

292
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,640
Yeah, OK, I will...

293
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,960
I will take care of that.

294
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,240
Personally.

295
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,000
Hello, Timer.

296
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,560
Having a good day?

297
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,760
Here you go. Knock yourself out.

298
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,600
I saw it on the news.

299
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,160
You got the first one.

300
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,120
Thank you.

301
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,720
Thank you.

302
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,480
Well, I'mjust doin' myjob.
You gotta stay away from the other two.

303
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,680
I could help you.

304
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,720
I could...

305
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,200
...set them up for you.

306
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,880
No, you stay clear.

307
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,960
Their future is about to become very dark.

308
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,640
You're still following me.

309
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,240
Aren't you?

310
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,800
It's gotten so I can feel you.

311
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,600
It's all part of the work.

312
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,880
Do you think about me?

313
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,400
I think about you.

314
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,080
My own personal ghost.

315
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,240
Or angel maybe.

316
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,160
- We could meet.
- You're a beautiful woman.

317
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,640
But, I don't meet.

318
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:57,120
- When this is over, I should leave.
- When are you gonna do it?

319
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,360
Soon.

320
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,760
Very soon.

321
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,120
Trent, you know the Chief of Police.

322
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,440
Trent is going to work with us
on this problem.

323
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,080
He was a former employee of the...

324
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,600
...CIA.

325
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:21,560
He is an explosives expert,
and I think he can be a big help.

326
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,040
I don't know.

327
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:26,480
This has become very public.
I'm sure you want a low profile.

328
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,280
Yeah, please.

329
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,640
It would be hard for Ned to go unnoticed.

330
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,960
I think there's more involved here
than keeping a low profile.

331
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:43,880
I'd say that I'm the one you can trust,
which is the main word here... trust.

332
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,480
To take him out clean.

333
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,440
Our bomb boys are the best.

334
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,440
I hope that's true.
They better be fucking magicians...

335
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,600
...because this man's impressive.

336
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,520
What are you, a fucking fan?

337
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:57,400
Come on! Stop that, this is serious, right?

338
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,000
Don't you two start!

339
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:03,200
We're here to find a way to protect
the business. Don't forget that.

340
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,040
Is that understood?

341
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,160
I must tell you...

342
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,560
...that this one is not negotiable.

343
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,040
I'll do what I can. Put him on as a fed.

344
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,520
Chief, always a pleasure.

345
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,800
Good to see you again.

346
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,640
OK, Danny, help me up.

347
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,680
Oh, boy. I hate that deep couch.

348
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:41,600
Now, listen. Danny, you'll do me a favor.

349
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,840
Do your best to make
this thing look official.

350
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:49,240
No, please. You do that,
and I promise you...

351
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,200
...I will not forget you.

352
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,920
A man's got to eat.

353
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,760
Idiota.

354
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,240
Where's the bomb squad?

355
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:37,080
Come on, boys and girls,
what are we doing? Look alive.

356
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,480
What've you got?

357
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,000
We're doing a complete background
check on everybody at the party.

358
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,160
Give me the next one.

359
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:00,000
Listen, I'll handle the biographies.
You trace the C-4. OK, Ace?

360
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:05,080
Chief says you're on this. Fine.

361
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:08,600
But I don't take orders
from any ex-anything.

362
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,760
OK, Ace?

363
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:14,360
I must tell you. I'm sorry,
I thought your chief said...

364
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:17,320
...the fullest cooperation
would be forthcoming.

365
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,160
I must tell you something.

366
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,640
This doesn't feel like full cooperation.

367
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:24,200
Look at this shit. What's this?
This is, uh...

368
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,160
Shouldn't this be in the lock-up?

369
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,560
I don't know. Maybe I'm wrong.

370
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:30,400
You guys are the experts.
Maybe you don't need me.

371
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,840
I mean, like what is this? This is...

372
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,640
This is Semtex.

373
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,720
Am I right? Plastique.

374
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:38,960
Plastic explosive.

375
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,840
Am I right? You're the expert.

376
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:44,200
This could blow up this whole area,
and if this area goes...

377
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,440
...the whole building could go up.
Am I right?

378
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,240
I don't know.

379
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,880
Maybe if I put this in here...

380
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,520
What else do we have here?

381
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:58,600
This is a plunger detonator, right?
And that's a little mini-receiver.

382
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:02,640
This looks like American circuitry to me.
Call me a patriot...

383
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,920
...but American craftsmanship
is the greatest.

384
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,440
Watch.

385
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,560
Here we go.

386
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:10,800
Let's see.

387
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,600
Perfect fit, first time...

388
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,560
...every time. Screw it on.

389
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,200
One little twist.

390
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,000
And, voilà.

391
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,360
A perfect receiver bomb.

392
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,160
Which of course is...

393
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,400
...absolutely worthless without a...

394
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,080
...transmitter.

395
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,400
Twenty seconds, and...

396
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,680
...we're hot.

397
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:44,040
Deactivate it, you sanctimonious prick!

398
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,240
Cut that shit!

399
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,480
OK, you made your point!

400
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,600
Have I?

401
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:53,640
- That's enough!
- What do you mean?

402
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,720
You think I give a shit
if the whole block goes up?

403
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:56,640
I don't!

404
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,480
You've had enough. Is that it?

405
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,440
Yes, enough is enough!

406
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,680
- I can't do it.
- Twelve.

407
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,840
What the hell, are you crazy?

408
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:09,280
I'm the craziest person
you'll ever meet in your life.

409
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,000
Six.

410
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,080
Five.

411
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,000
Four.

412
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:16,040
- Three.
- Please!

413
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:26,720
Now, here's a tip...

414
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,920
...you take care of the shit work.

415
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:32,040
And leave the fox at the party to me. OK?

416
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,760
We on the same page?

417
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,000
Ace?

418
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:19,320
Do you like it? Those go upstairs.

419
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:21,000
I like where I live.

420
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:24,240
I like you where I live.

421
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,080
Thanks.

422
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,920
Close the doors. Leave.

423
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,520
Better than you're used to?

424
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:49,000
Next time you order a hit you might
consider taking out your decorator.

425
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:55,200
You like to live dangerously?

426
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:58,760
A little danger never killed anyone.

427
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:00,120
Right, baby?

428
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:03,000
Sometimes.

429
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:17,720
You know...

430
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:20,040
...when I look at you...

431
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:24,120
...I see something I like very much.

432
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,040
Know what it is?

433
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:29,400
I'm breathless with anticipation.

434
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:32,440
I see me.

435
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,240
Let's get this over with.

436
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,480
Wait a minute.

437
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,960
You're the Mob's accountant, Bill.

438
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:14,120
Is that all you've got for me?

439
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,320
No. I have something else for you.

440
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,440
See you later.

441
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:27,600
Don't touch that! It could be a bomb!

442
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:31,760
Very funny.

443
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:42,320
Son of a bitch!

444
00:47:59,040 --> 00:47:59,840
Kid!

445
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:04,880
Look at the way you parked
my fucking car.

446
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:08,160
Sir, I didn't park your car.

447
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:11,600
Sorry.

448
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:13,640
I'll get it for you.

449
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:51,120
Here's your tip.

450
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:26,120
Some ride that must have been.

451
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:28,680
Is this the decoy?

452
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:31,560
Who was this supposed to fool?

453
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:35,120
Any witnesses?

454
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,000
The kid?

455
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,320
Nice one, Ray.

456
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,160
Clever boy.

457
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:56,360
'"Bye-bye. '"

458
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:00,000
At least he hasn't lost his sense of humor.

459
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:07,160
Who gave you permission to smile?

460
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,720
Shut up.

461
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,120
Quite a step up for you, isn't it?

462
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:36,280
Depends on how you look at it.

463
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,400
- Tomas is on his way-
- Shut up!

464
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:41,320
Who are you?

465
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:44,320
I said, '"Who are you?'"

466
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:46,080
Who are you?

467
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:47,600
I'll tell you who you are.

468
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:49,240
You are nobody.

469
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:50,960
I created Adrian Hastings.

470
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:52,480
I got you inside.

471
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:55,440
You work for me.
Don't you ever fucking forget it.

472
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:59,680
You should have him
out in the open by now.

473
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:02,320
You get your three corpses,
I get Ray Quick.

474
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:04,800
That was the deal. What happened?

475
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:07,920
I can't keep him on the line
long enough to get a trace.

476
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,080
He doesn't want to take a meeting.

477
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:13,000
What should I do?
Wish him out of hiding?

478
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:14,840
You're in over your head.

479
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:18,120
Maybe you've outlived your usefulness.
Is that possible?

480
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:19,480
You need me.

481
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,480
I studied him, I drew him out.

482
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:27,280
With my voice, with my ads. He trusts me.

483
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:29,800
Why do I need you?

484
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:33,520
Why don't I just grab him
before he brings Tomas down?

485
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,200
Why do you even need...

486
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,000
...to live at all?

487
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:40,880
Maybe he's not interested in a big-mouth,
hotshot asshole like you.

488
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:46,440
You know what I love about you?

489
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,840
It's not just this...

490
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,080
...poetry.

491
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:55,080
It's your heart.

492
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:58,280
It's the heart you bring to your work.

493
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:03,440
But if you don't set up a meeting with
him before he drops the third target...

494
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:05,920
...you'll pray for a lifetime
of Tomas's attentions...

495
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,360
...his delicate touch.

496
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,960
- I promise.
- Don't touch me.

497
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:12,160
I'm sorry.

498
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:17,760
I've always wondered...

499
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,840
...what was it like...

500
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:24,600
...after you watched your parents die.

501
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:26,440
Did you go over to the bed?

502
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:30,000
Did little May hug them?

503
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,960
Did you try to shake them awake?

504
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,200
How much blood?

505
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:38,240
I'm just curious, was there...

506
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:41,320
...a lot of blood?

507
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:43,000
Don't push me.

508
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,120
What are you doing here?

509
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:03,800
Take it easy, hotshot.

510
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:05,800
I'm checking up on you.

511
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:08,800
I don't need you goddamn
babysitting for me.

512
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:12,120
Why don't you look for who's hitting us?

513
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,080
What's the first move?

514
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,640
Door-to-door search?

515
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:17,200
I'm sick of you.

516
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,320
My father thinks he needs you.

517
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,720
When he finds out he doesn't...

518
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,200
...you're mine.

519
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:25,640
Well...

520
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:28,000
I feel threatened.

521
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:29,600
You are threatened.

522
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:55,960
Five hundred.

523
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:08,000
OK, I'm out of here.

524
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:11,960
Just a second.

525
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:16,680
May Munro.

526
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:28,600
Where are you going!

527
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:29,880
Get up!

528
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:32,880
Go in there! Get him!
Get the fuck in there!

529
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:37,880
Keep them back.

530
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:42,200
Get them out!

531
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:50,960
Good one, Ray.

532
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:53,400
Really good.

533
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:39,720
Joe, I am so sorry.

534
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:50,680
You're sorry?

535
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:54,960
My son...

536
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:59,040
...is in a closed casket...

537
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:02,360
...and...

538
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:05,120
...you are sorry.

539
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:09,440
I hold you responsible.

540
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:11,400
He wouldn't lay low.

541
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:13,160
What did you say?

542
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:17,880
I said, '"He wouldn't lay low. '"

543
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:21,480
Are you trying to tell me
that was his fault now?

544
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:23,080
That's how it was.

545
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:26,520
The way it was!
You were supposed to protect his back!

546
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:28,760
His life was in your hands!

547
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:30,520
You know what you did?

548
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:33,080
You cut my heart out, you know.

549
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:36,240
And now you look, my...

550
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:40,400
...my son...

551
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:43,640
...is lying in a box.

552
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:45,760
You know...

553
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:47,680
...you were the one...

554
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,480
...who let it happen.

555
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:51,440
You're not thinking straight.

556
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:53,600
Jesus Christ, don't you try to tell me.

557
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:55,560
I swear to God, don't say another word.

558
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:57,800
Not another word or I'll kill you here.

559
00:59:57,880 --> 00:59:59,320
You understand?

560
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:10,760
Now...

561
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:15,960
...you go out...

562
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:20,960
...you go out and you find
this explosives expert...

563
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:23,040
...and you...

564
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:26,160
...bring him to me alive...

565
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:28,720
...before I bury Tomas.

566
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:49,720
"Adrian Hastings of Miami, Dade County.

567
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:53,600
"Services 3:00 p. m., Friday
at San Juan De Bosco. "

568
01:01:57,720 --> 01:02:00,280
Her body's in cold storage
at County General.

569
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:04,920
How does this sound?

570
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:08,040
'"Lonely, needy, deeply hurt.
Will be discreet. '"

571
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:10,560
Story of my life.

572
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:15,400
Get this on every major
bulletin board service.

573
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:18,920
Put the response number through
long-distance and be ready to trace.

574
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:19,760
OK?

575
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:20,880
OK.

576
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:55,320
Guys like this, they won't advertise.
You must draw them out.

577
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:57,160
Do your best.

578
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:02,160
Hi, baby! Are you wearing any underwear?

579
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:04,640
Get rid of him.

580
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:07,200
Your experience doesn't match my needs.

581
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:09,520
- Get rid of him.
- I am.

582
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:12,760
Thirty calls and nothing.

583
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:14,520
I don't know if this makes sense.

584
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:17,240
I'll decide if it makes any sense or not, OK?

585
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:19,000
Go on, take it. Take it!

586
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:21,160
Line five and...

587
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:22,720
Go.

588
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:23,960
Hello?

589
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:26,440
Calling about the ad, right?

590
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:29,480
Yeah.

591
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:32,080
Right.

592
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:35,040
I thought you were someone else.

593
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:37,760
The ad was similar to others.

594
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:40,960
Give me a number.
I can't talk on this phone.

595
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:42,600
Forget it.

596
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:44,720
You have a message from May.

597
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:46,840
I've got a message...

598
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:48,400
...from May.

599
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:51,800
- Who is this?
- She's OK.

600
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:53,800
She wants to meet you.

601
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:55,920
No, I don't think so.

602
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,280
Put Trent on the line.

603
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:03,040
What did you say?

604
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:06,320
Trent. He's standing next to you.
I want to talk to him.

605
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,240
Put him on the line!

606
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:13,520
Ned, can you hear me?

607
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:17,200
Talk to me. Talk to me, Ned.

608
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:21,240
Your playmates know what kind of man
you are? Why the Agency fired you?

609
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:25,040
That killing people
was like jerking-off for you?

610
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:28,560
Watching those bloody bodies
going though the air gets you off.

611
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:32,320
Talk to me. When you crawl
into your hole at night alone...

612
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:37,000
...and you are alone, aren't you?
Tell me what burns you the most.

613
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:40,160
Losing yourjob as a CIA attack dog...

614
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:43,440
...or knowing that I turned you in
and I'm still alive?

615
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,320
Talk to me!

616
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:48,040
You'll sell your service
to the highest bidder!

617
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:49,360
You stinking maggot!

618
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:52,560
Fuck you, Ray! Fuck you! You killed!

619
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:54,760
Your bombs!

620
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:58,160
How many? 10, 50, 100,
before you lost count?

621
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:02,320
It was your bombs on the bridge
in Bogotá! Your bomb in the cabana!

622
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:05,720
But you're getting sloppy.
You broke your code.

623
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:07,840
You killed an innocent bystander.

624
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:10,200
It is eating you up inside, isn't it?

625
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:13,400
You were always too sensitive.
But guess what?

626
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:16,400
I'm coming to take all the pain away.

627
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:20,720
I'll fucking cut it right out of you,
and close your heart in my hand.

628
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:23,000
I'm right behind you! I know you!

629
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:27,400
You've got no mercy.
You got no fucking loyalty.

630
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:29,600
And you got no code.

631
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:32,880
- Listen to me, you son of a bitch!
- Time's up, 58 seconds.

632
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:38,360
Goddamn it!

633
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:39,400
Son of a bitch!

634
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:42,040
I'll fucking kill you! I'll vaporize your ass!

635
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:43,720
What're you looking at?

636
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:48,320
Turn around!

637
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:56,800
Nobody...

638
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:58,480
...says a word.

639
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:03,080
Tell me that you got a trace.

640
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:04,600
Just tell me.

641
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:07,080
He jumped off before we locked him.

642
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:09,920
- We got a partial trace.
- Shut up.

643
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:36,680
She gave of herself...

644
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:39,760
...for 40 years.

645
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:41,960
She dedicated her life...

646
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:44,160
...generously...

647
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:45,720
...courageously...

648
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:49,640
...to all of us, Cuban orphans everywhere.

649
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:53,280
She has shown us a road.

650
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:56,720
For the wages sin pays is death.

651
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:00,280
But the gift God gives...

652
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:02,120
...is everlasting life...

653
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:04,520
...by Christ, Jesus, Our Lord.

654
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:07,080
How did I look?

655
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:45,200
Why did you do this?

656
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:47,760
I wanted to meet you.

657
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:53,280
I wanted to know if you were
everything I ever thought.

658
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:55,080
Nobody ever is.

659
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:21,040
Hold it.

660
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:24,800
Open the casket.

661
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:26,040
Who are you?

662
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:28,560
I said, '"Open the fucking casket! '"

663
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:38,720
Bitch!

664
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:40,680
Fuck!

665
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:14,280
We shouldn't be here.

666
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:16,520
Not if we want to stay alive.

667
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:18,640
Is it worth it?

668
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:20,240
I think so.

669
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:26,240
I hope so.

670
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:49,440
Let me see this beautiful face.

671
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:03,680
Why'd you let me think I killed you?

672
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:06,720
It was the only way
I could get Tomas's men off my back.

673
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:08,440
Give me some details.

674
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:11,520
Poor lady O.D.'d in the emergency room.

675
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:15,120
I dropped my wallet in her purse...

676
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:16,840
...and here I am.

677
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:21,040
Pretty good, especially...

678
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:23,560
...if you're an amateur.

679
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:27,960
You could've been killed.

680
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:31,240
I had to be there when he died.

681
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:32,920
I needed to see it.

682
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:37,560
Anyway...

683
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:42,760
I knew you'd choose
the safest way for everybody.

684
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:45,480
I studied your style.

685
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:49,800
I know you always focused
your detonation.

686
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:54,400
So I knew...

687
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:59,200
...as long as I was facing Tomas,
right in front of him, like this...

688
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:03,360
Even closer, like this...

689
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:09,480
...I knew I'd feel safe.

690
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:20,360
Excuse me.

691
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:22,520
Police are looking for these two.

692
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:26,080
If you see them,
call the number on the back.

693
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:27,560
Wait.

694
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:29,720
I have seen them.

695
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:15,080
Back from the dead.

696
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:17,080
Jesus.

697
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:18,200
Thank God.

698
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:20,760
I was just going to call you.

699
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:24,440
About the funeral thing,
I'm sorry, there's just...

700
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:26,920
It was the only way to draw him out.

701
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:28,520
It worked. I don't have to tell you.

702
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:31,680
I used the '"attachment'" thing,
and I got him.

703
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:34,200
Couldn't stay away from me.

704
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:35,200
So?

705
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:37,560
I just want to get one thing straight.

706
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:40,760
You did all this to deliver him to me?

707
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:45,720
We had a deal. I hold up my end of a deal.

708
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:47,480
You're a classic, May.

709
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:49,240
Where is he?

710
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:50,480
- Here!
- Where?

711
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:52,320
- In the hotel.
- I know. Where?

712
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:54,240
I got a key. I think it-

713
01:15:58,320 --> 01:15:59,440
This key?

714
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:02,360
I mean, I do have a key.

715
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:06,360
- He's on a high floor, it's 10 or 11.
- Take her to the car.

716
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:08,640
- Go on.
- I left my purse, I have to-

717
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:11,600
- Shut up. Take her to the car.
- I have a couple of things to do.

718
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:13,800
Stop yanking me around!

719
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:24,440
He made me so nervous.
It'll take me one second.

720
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:26,200
Where can I go?

721
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:34,080
Harry, listen-

722
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:36,720
Harry, she'll call you back.

723
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:40,080
Give me my phone!

724
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:45,360
Room 1205.

725
01:16:57,920 --> 01:16:59,720
León's men are on their way up.

726
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:01,400
You set me up.

727
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:02,920
- Why?
- I did not.

728
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:23,960
Hit it. Let's get out.

729
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:26,120
There's a fire. Let's go. Rush.

730
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:32,280
Where you going? Use the stairs.
This one's full. Get out of here!

731
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:14,040
We're sorry.
Your call cannot be completed as dialed.

732
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:17,440
Please check the number and
dial again or call the operator.

733
01:18:24,680 --> 01:18:28,000
Ifyou have to make a call,
please hang up and try again...

734
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:31,520
Ifyou need help,
hang up and dial your operator.

735
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,120
Don't move!

736
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:02,000
Don't touch anything!

737
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:14,120
Give me your hand!

738
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:36,440
Holy shit!

739
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:46,520
Go! Go!

740
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:58,160
Hey, what's with the lights here?

741
01:19:58,240 --> 01:20:00,320
Security, get him!

742
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:32,880
Come on, asshole! Come on!

743
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:09,040
There has been an accident,
but there is no danger.

744
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:11,320
No cause for alarm.

745
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:38,120
That's her.

746
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:40,080
Her who?

747
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:42,320
That's the bitch who was banging Tomas.

748
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:45,200
Her ID was faked.
Ray Quick is working for her.

749
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:50,320
Alice...

750
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:52,400
...and Stan Munro.

751
01:21:53,320 --> 01:21:55,080
What are you talking about?

752
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:59,120
I was the kid your little boy
missed in the closet.

753
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:05,760
That was a long time ago.

754
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:07,080
Not to me.

755
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:09,840
Now I understand.

756
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:12,160
Now I understand. You...

757
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:14,440
You think...

758
01:22:15,080 --> 01:22:19,120
...that my son Tomas gave the orders
for the killings. Well, you are wrong.

759
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:24,560
If anybody in this house has power to give
orders, it's me.

760
01:22:24,920 --> 01:22:26,960
Understand? I give the orders.

761
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:29,360
I give the orders of who is killed...

762
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:32,560
...and who is not killed.
Is that understood?

763
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:35,440
I need her...

764
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:37,280
...to get to Ray.

765
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:39,600
I must make one phone call,
then she's yours.

766
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:41,120
But I need her now.

767
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:42,480
You sure?

768
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:45,000
Joe, please.

769
01:22:50,120 --> 01:22:51,720
Take the bitch.

770
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:10,920
Show time.

771
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:15,080
- Hello?
- It's me.

772
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:19,280
I'm sorry. I didn't know they were coming.
Believe me.

773
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:21,320
I'll tell you what I believe.

774
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:24,240
I believe you're very good on the phone.

775
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:27,400
I need to see you.

776
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:29,840
And get set up again?

777
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:32,040
No, I'll pass.

778
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,440
I'm through taking risks.

779
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:35,800
So that's it?

780
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:37,720
We just walk away?

781
01:23:37,960 --> 01:23:38,920
Forever?

782
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:40,880
It's safer for everybody.

783
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:47,680
Come on, I don't know what
this relationship is about...

784
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:50,240
...but I know it's not based on safety.

785
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:52,280
You're too much of an unknown.

786
01:23:52,840 --> 01:23:54,600
Adrian Hastings, May Munro.

787
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:56,840
Who the hell are you?

788
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:00,960
Remember the Fontainebleau?

789
01:24:01,320 --> 01:24:02,440
I remember.

790
01:24:04,680 --> 01:24:06,480
Remember touching me?

791
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:10,480
Do you remember my voice?

792
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:13,360
Not over the phone...

793
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:17,040
...but carried on breath.

794
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:19,760
On you.

795
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:22,480
Near you.

796
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,640
Close enough to feel.

797
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:29,040
Why are you saying this to me?

798
01:24:30,120 --> 01:24:32,040
Because I have to.

799
01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:35,240
Come on, Ray.

800
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:38,120
You gotta see me.

801
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:40,400
Please.

802
01:24:41,640 --> 01:24:42,840
Please, baby.

803
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:54,640
Double-M Seafood, right now.

804
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:57,280
All right.

805
01:24:57,840 --> 01:24:58,920
And Ray...

806
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:00,560
I'm here.

807
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:04,120
Do you remember the note
our relationship ended on?

808
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:06,280
The last thing I said to you?

809
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:08,680
I remember everything.

810
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:10,960
I meant every word.

811
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:35,080
You're goin' in alone.

812
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:37,200
And if this is a trap...

813
01:25:37,400 --> 01:25:39,480
...I promise you, you're gonna die.

814
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:42,080
But if he's in there...

815
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:45,840
...make him feel safe and secure.
And I'll be listening...

816
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:48,160
...on this microphone.

817
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:50,560
The second I hear his voice...

818
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:51,800
...we move in.

819
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:53,080
Understand?

820
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:55,240
Now get out of the fucking car.

821
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:13,280
When this is all over...

822
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:15,680
...I can see us spending time together.

823
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:18,160
You know, you wash...

824
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:21,640
...the stink of Tomas and Ray off you...

825
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:24,000
...you might clean up pretty good.

826
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:33,760
Go ahead.

827
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:37,600
And then you can go in
and get him yourself.

828
01:26:37,680 --> 01:26:39,360
I don't give a shit!

829
01:26:41,680 --> 01:26:42,960
Go on!

830
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:46,400
Move!

831
01:26:54,680 --> 01:26:56,000
If she blinks...

832
01:26:56,640 --> 01:26:57,920
...kill her.

833
01:27:22,040 --> 01:27:23,640
Bad plan, Ned.

834
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:26,440
That's it, we've got him. Move in.

835
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:50,800
Go, you chicken shits!

836
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:53,920
You think he'll top that? Get in there!

837
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:56,320
Watch the river and the side streets!

838
01:27:56,960 --> 01:27:58,160
Fucking crabs!

839
01:27:58,240 --> 01:27:59,280
Nice one.

840
01:28:04,160 --> 01:28:05,560
Watch the river!

841
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:32,560
You want to set me up again?

842
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:33,840
What's that?

843
01:28:34,320 --> 01:28:35,600
Break it down.

844
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:39,760
Air brakes.

845
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:43,680
Complex sound, slightly muffled.

846
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:45,760
People talking...

847
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:47,480
...clamping down steps.

848
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:49,760
A clapping shut.

849
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:52,800
Voices... mechanical sounds.

850
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:55,360
- A hiss!
- People getting off a bus!

851
01:28:56,880 --> 01:28:59,280
You must have an overview.

852
01:28:59,360 --> 01:29:00,720
Are they on both tapes?

853
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:04,600
I knew it! We gotta have bus routes.
What do we have?

854
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:08,880
He uses pay phones,
but he gets there by bus.

855
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:11,440
Oh, Ray, always so precise.

856
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:14,720
Let's say, he gets on a bus
wherever he lives, and he...

857
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:17,720
...goes in both directions.
Good counter-surveillance technique.

858
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:21,400
He takes the bus 20, 25 minutes
in each direction. So we have...

859
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:24,840
Four, four and four.

860
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:27,120
Here we go, triangulation.

861
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:31,680
Three routes, that's it.
We want checks in five-minute intervals.

862
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:33,520
How about the restaurants?

863
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:35,760
He must eat sometime.

864
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:39,760
Try to remember. He'd have gotten off
the bus alone, bought cigarettes.

865
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:40,960
Look at that face!

866
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:43,840
We have a lot of regular customers,
but he ain't one.

867
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:45,920
Look at that face again!
Come on. Come on!

868
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,520
Nothing.

869
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:49,680
Hey, Henry!

870
01:29:51,640 --> 01:29:53,720
I forgot to tell you, we deliver.

871
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:14,560
Now there's a vision.

872
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:21,240
Good morning, stranger.

873
01:30:22,160 --> 01:30:23,760
I've got to go.

874
01:30:23,880 --> 01:30:27,280
Where? I think we already wore out
our welcome at the Hilton.

875
01:30:33,680 --> 01:30:35,440
I want to stay with you.

876
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:40,720
But it's not over for me.
Joe León ordered the hit.

877
01:30:41,720 --> 01:30:43,280
Let me get this right.

878
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:48,000
You think killing Joe
will make everything OK?

879
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:49,520
Something has to.

880
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:57,040
You did the job. I'm not asking
for your help. I'll do it. I owe him.

881
01:30:57,200 --> 01:30:58,120
No.

882
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:00,240
You owe her.

883
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:05,600
Her. A whole life. Come here.

884
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:08,480
Come here.

885
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:20,400
Put all this behind you now,
or the past will eat you alive.

886
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:22,720
I know what I'm talking about.

887
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:28,080
I have to go.

888
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:30,520
Wish me luck.

889
01:31:31,080 --> 01:31:32,080
No.

890
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:43,360
Come here. You're not going.

891
01:32:26,160 --> 01:32:29,440
Detonation sequence primed. Enter code.

892
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:31,080
Top of the world, Mom.

893
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:33,400
Controlled!

894
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:36,680
One... two... three...

895
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:46,320
I'm afraid to ask.

896
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:49,520
Explosions will occur
if the inner perimeter is breached.

897
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:53,440
Each one of these lights is a pressure
mine. If one goes, they all go.

898
01:32:53,560 --> 01:32:54,600
- Where are they?
- Everywhere.

899
01:32:54,680 --> 01:32:56,280
Don't worry, they're not armed yet.

900
01:32:56,360 --> 01:32:58,480
When these lights turn red... worry.

901
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:10,160
This is good. Nice sneak attack!

902
01:33:10,240 --> 01:33:13,040
Do not approach the warehouse.
Perimeter is armed.

903
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:16,880
Please, cut the bullshit.

904
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:25,200
That's a good one. I taught him that.

905
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:30,160
Nice sense of irony,
blowing up the bomb disposal unit.

906
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:31,480
Nice work, Ray.

907
01:33:32,680 --> 01:33:33,800
WARNING!

908
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:36,600
Gunfire will automatically
detonate B-20's...

909
01:33:36,720 --> 01:33:39,640
...sufficient to destroy two square miles.

910
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:45,040
Give me that.

911
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:48,640
Listen up! Anybody shoots...

912
01:33:48,720 --> 01:33:51,120
...anybody shoots, I shoot them!

913
01:33:52,680 --> 01:33:56,080
This whole place is wired and
I'm taking him alive. Got that?

914
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:08,320
That's new.

915
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:10,320
How's that feel, Ace?

916
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:16,160
Fuck this amateur hour.

917
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:27,680
You're crazy.

918
01:34:33,920 --> 01:34:36,840
All the highly trained professionals
of the world...

919
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:40,880
...all the hardware...

920
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,560
...all the technology,
and what have you got?

921
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:46,480
Nothing.

922
01:34:47,480 --> 01:34:50,000
You gotta do everything yourself.

923
01:34:50,720 --> 01:34:52,000
And why?

924
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:56,000
You can't get good help these days.

925
01:35:21,200 --> 01:35:23,040
A surprise for you, Ray.

926
01:35:28,720 --> 01:35:30,560
It's set. Let's go.

927
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:38,160
Don't move!

928
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:40,920
- I'll lead you through the mines.
- Evacuate!

929
01:35:41,040 --> 01:35:42,120
Ray...?

930
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:46,880
I'm sorry. Should I have knocked?

931
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:53,600
You lose, I win.

932
01:35:56,560 --> 01:35:59,280
She's hot, Ray.
Semtex, sprayed with nitro.

933
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:02,640
Cigarette case. Honest Injun, take a look.

934
01:36:04,240 --> 01:36:05,920
Just a peek, no touch.

935
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:15,600
You might ask yourself,
'"Why is today my time to die?'"

936
01:36:20,440 --> 01:36:22,480
Take it out. Slowly.

937
01:36:23,680 --> 01:36:24,960
Slowly.

938
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:27,920
Open it.

939
01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:32,720
Everyone deserves to die.

940
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:34,880
Ask God.

941
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:36,960
He kills across the board.

942
01:36:39,320 --> 01:36:40,920
So why shouldn't I?

943
01:36:42,480 --> 01:36:43,440
Bye.

944
01:36:45,040 --> 01:36:47,000
Here's a tip I learned from you.

945
01:36:47,080 --> 01:36:48,960
It's a focused detonation. Only she blows.

946
01:36:49,040 --> 01:36:52,200
- It's pretty nifty.
- Don't move it. It's a mercury switch.

947
01:36:52,280 --> 01:36:54,160
Any change in angle, it goes.

948
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:55,840
Got it.

949
01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:58,560
Anyway, Ray, she's dead already.
What I need...

950
01:36:58,960 --> 01:37:01,600
...what I need is to take you alive
because my boss...

951
01:37:01,680 --> 01:37:04,160
...wants to look in your eyes when you die.

952
01:37:04,240 --> 01:37:06,000
Sick fuck.

953
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:07,840
I'm touched, really.

954
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:09,600
What happened to us, Ray?

955
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:12,320
We were...

956
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:15,400
...we were good together.

957
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:19,280
You were the rigger and I was the trigger.

958
01:37:21,560 --> 01:37:23,640
You shouldn't have taken me down.

959
01:37:24,080 --> 01:37:26,480
Because now, you fuck!

960
01:37:29,040 --> 01:37:31,600
I see you're still into
the old memories, Ray.

961
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:36,160
Those memories always do you in, right?

962
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:38,960
It's that '"trying to save the innocent. '"

963
01:37:39,440 --> 01:37:41,200
You know your problem, Ray?

964
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:43,840
You're too sentimental.

965
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:46,480
There's nothing wrong
with being sentimental.

966
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:49,920
Sometimes it can save your ass.

967
01:37:54,160 --> 01:37:56,320
Here's a tip: no fail-safe.

968
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:57,680
Pressure pads.

969
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,320
30 seconds to total destruction.

970
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:11,200
Slide it to me.

971
01:38:15,200 --> 01:38:16,320
25 seconds.

972
01:38:18,160 --> 01:38:19,400
It's all right.

973
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:21,200
Just do it, May.

974
01:38:21,280 --> 01:38:22,800
Slide your hands out.

975
01:38:24,080 --> 01:38:25,840
20 seconds.

976
01:38:30,080 --> 01:38:32,680
Get out of here.
Straight down the right side.

977
01:38:32,760 --> 01:38:34,280
Not without you.

978
01:38:36,520 --> 01:38:38,040
I'm right behind you.

979
01:38:42,520 --> 01:38:43,640
10 seconds.

980
01:38:50,400 --> 01:38:51,480
5 seconds.

981
01:38:52,040 --> 01:38:53,600
Come on! Come on!

982
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:56,080
3 seconds.

983
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:16,160
Thank you.

984
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:28,080
You are a kind God.

985
01:40:30,120 --> 01:40:31,240
Thank you.

986
01:40:56,160 --> 01:40:57,360
You bastarda!

987
01:41:09,880 --> 01:41:11,000
How do you feel?

988
01:41:11,080 --> 01:41:12,120
Better.
