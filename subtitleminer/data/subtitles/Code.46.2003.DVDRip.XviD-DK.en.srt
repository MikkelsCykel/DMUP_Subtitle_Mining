00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,850
<i>I think about the day we met.</i>

2
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:25,604
I suppose you would
have arrived par avion.

3
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:29,066
<i>Maybe you were the first to get to security.</i>

4
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:33,945
<i>You didn't intend to stay.</i>

5
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:37,240
<i>You only had 24-hour cover,
so luggage a mano.</i>

6
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:39,993
<i>And they probably had a driver waiting...</i>

7
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:42,162
so you didn't need to find un coche.

8
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:56,093
<i>You'd never been to Shanghai before.
It was all new to you.</i>

9
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:58,387
How do people live out here?

10
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,057
It's not living. Just existing.

11
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:05,894
- You ever lived al fuera?
- No.

12
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,069
Can I have your papel, please?

13
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:22,744
Sherbet fountains, cigarettes,
batteries, haircuts.

14
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:25,038
Who gets their hair cut at a checkpoint?

15
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,582
But I'm vite. I will show you.

16
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:34,798
- Give me a couple of sherbet fountains.
- Two sherbet fountains.

17
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:38,260
Get me in, mister.
I can do haircuts in there.

18
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:41,096
- I'm wasted out here.
- I've only got cover for myself.

19
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:43,890
- You got any spare cover?
- I only cover for one.

20
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:47,269
- Sorry.
- You want to swap places with me?

21
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:50,063
- You and me?
- I wear suit, you wear this.

22
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,191
It's tempting. Good luck.
What's your name?

23
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:55,444
- Nabil.
- All right. Bye.

24
00:03:57,446 --> 00:04:00,615
I don't think it's a good idea
to encourage them.

25
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:04,327
If people can't get cover, there's a reason.

26
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:22,637
<i>You arrived in the morning,
so the streets were deserted.</i>

27
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:01,927
<i>Did you call anyone?
Did you have a cerveza?</i>

28
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,847
<i>Sometimes I imagine you
watching the news.</i>

29
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:07,891
<i>Sometimes playing a game.</i>

30
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:11,728
<i>Sometimes sleeping,
preparing yourself for the night ahead.</i>

31
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:18,193
<i>The thing I can't imagine
is that we hadn't met.</i>

32
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,654
<i>Hadn't even heard of each other.</i>

33
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,740
<i>That you thought it was going to be
just another night.</i>

34
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:39,548
Happy birthday, Maria. Time to wake up.

35
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,388
<i>It was my birthday, which I hate.</i>

36
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,855
<i>Every year on my birthday I have a dream.</i>

37
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,607
<i>Always the same dream.</i>

38
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:01,570
<i>I go down into the subway,
I wait for the train.</i>

39
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:04,656
<i>I'm worried I'm going to be late.</i>

40
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,826
<i>The train leaves the station.</i>

41
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:11,955
<i>I feel like going to sleep,
but there's someone I have to find.</i>

42
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,586
<i>And I have to find him
before the train stops.</i>

43
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:19,921
<i>The train goes through one station.</i>

44
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:23,300
<i>There are 19 more to go.
I have to find him.</i>

45
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,094
<i>And then I wake up.</i>

46
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:29,139
Happy birthday, Maria. Time to wake up.

47
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:41,443
<i>The next year I had
exactly the same dream.</i>

48
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:44,446
<i>Only this time I went past two stations.</i>

49
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:49,993
<i>Don't ask me how I knew. I just knew
that there were 18 stations to go.</i>

50
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:55,248
Next year, 17. Next year, 16.

51
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,876
<i>Every birthday, one less.</i>

52
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:04,799
<i>Today's my birthday.
Today I'm down to the last one.</i>

53
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:10,138
<i>If I fall asleep, I'll get to my destination.</i>

54
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,642
<i>If I want to, I can discover my fate tonight.</i>

55
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:20,065
<i>- Lo siento.
- That's okay.</i>

56
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:27,030
<i>So, what am I going to do?</i>

57
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:30,367
<i>I'm going to stay awake all day.</i>

58
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:32,994
<i>Who wants to discover their fate?</i>

59
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:35,288
<i>Who wants to take a chance like that?</i>

60
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:37,582
- Hello.
- I'm here to see Mr. Backland.

61
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:40,293
I'll let him know you're here,
he'll send someone along.

62
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:43,463
I'm here on an investigation,
and I would find it useful...

63
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,715
if I could wander around a little bit.

64
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,302
All visitors have to be accompanied,
so if you'd like to wait over there.

65
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:51,888
- Someone will take you through.
- Let me do my job.

66
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:55,183
If I let you do yours,
then I wouldn't be doing mine, would I?

67
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:56,726
That is a conundrum.

68
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,189
If I could figure out your password,
your palabra...

69
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,191
You couldn't do it.

70
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,527
I just need to know
one piece of information.

71
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:09,864
- Is this some kind of trick?
- No. It could be anything. Just one thing.

72
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:12,575
Tell me one thing about yourself.
Anything at all.

73
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:16,329
<i>My birthday. My palabra's not my birthday.
Vingt-neuf.</i>

74
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,333
Your palabra is "carrefour."

75
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:23,294
- Crossroad. Carrefour.
- Wait. How did you know that?

76
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:26,172
- Can I register now?
- How did you know my palabra?

77
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:28,883
I listened to you while
you weren't speaking.

78
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:31,761
- Don't worry about it.
- I could get into trouble doing this.

79
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:35,890
I'm just gonna go straight to his office,
that's all I'll do. Don't worry.

80
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:51,531
- William Geld, salaam.
- Mr. Backland.

81
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,159
You caught me off guard.

82
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:56,661
I was going to come down
and greet you properly.

83
00:08:56,786 --> 00:09:00,123
I guess that's one of your skills. Cunning.

84
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:03,418
I have no cunning I'm afraid.

85
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:07,130
- This is your first visit?
- Yes.

86
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:10,967
Will you have time to see the mammoth?

87
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:14,220
We specialize in
short-term cover certificates.

88
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:17,098
We do limited cover pour specific tasks.

89
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:20,643
Maybe a parachute jump,
maybe a medical procedure.

90
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:24,272
People only buy fakes
if we won't grant legitimate cover.

91
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:28,193
If we won't grant legitimate cover,
believe me, there's a reason.

92
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,737
The Sphinx knows best.

93
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:35,784
Fake cover is a ticket
to avoidable suffering.

94
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,162
I worry about them, you know.

95
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,040
We know which printer
the fakes come from.

96
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:45,126
Every printer has its own fingerprint.

97
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:48,463
This one is from our number 8 printer.

98
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:52,884
Only a few people are cleared to use it.
It has to be one of them.

99
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,637
All I need is a nice quiet room
and some time...

100
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:58,473
and I'll have this cleared up for you
by this evening.

101
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:03,103
It's a happy workplace.
I don't want to create an atmosphere.

102
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,814
I don't want anyone
to know what's going on.

103
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:09,442
Tell them what you like.
Tell them I'm the tooth fairy.

104
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:21,371
Tell me something about yourself,
anything at all.

105
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:25,750
I was born in Nampally Road, Hyderabad.

106
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:29,504
- Tell me something about yourself.
- Anything?

107
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:33,383
Try to make it interesting,
I've got a long day ahead of me.

108
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:40,807
I have una cosa about freckles.
A sexual cosa.

109
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,852
I find freckles a turn-on.

110
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:47,939
Freckled skin, it's like it's clothed
and not clothed.

111
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,943
There's no freckle pornography.

112
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:55,446
Women get famous for breasts and legs,
but not for freckles.

113
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:57,365
There's Anne of Green Gables.

114
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,702
I regard Anne of Green Gables
as an erotic classic.

115
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,916
Normans. Amazing.

116
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:12,505
They invented the whole English language
out of nothing but French.

117
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:15,717
And some Latin, obviously.

118
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:17,427
Yeah, obviously.

119
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:21,556
There's a girl here, Maria.

120
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,892
She's tone-deaf.

121
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:26,895
She can't hold a tune to save her life.

122
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:31,941
That's beautiful, don't you think?

123
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:39,240
- What are you thinking?
- I'm thinking, "Have we met before?"

124
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:42,744
Upstairs, the foyer,
we almost bumped into each other.

125
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:45,747
I feel I know you.

126
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,334
Come on. One thing about yourself.

127
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:54,130
I'm not sure I want you to know
something about me.

128
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:58,760
Anyway, I can never think of anything when
people ask me straight out comme ca.

129
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,054
You want to prompt me?

130
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,848
- It won't work if I prompt you.
- What won't work?

131
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:07,685
Tell me what you're doing later tonight.

132
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:14,651
- Is that a question or an invitation?
- It's a prompt.

133
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:20,740
Tonight, I am going to stay awake...

134
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,452
until the sun goes down.

135
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:28,289
I'm not going to sleep.

136
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:30,833
<i>Pourquoi?</i>

137
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,127
It's my birthday.

138
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:38,633
Happy birthday.

139
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:50,228
I'm gonna need to take your information
for future reference.

140
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,320
It's difficult.

141
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:04,283
When you can get a big dinero
for a piece of paper...

142
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:05,994
it's a big temptation.

143
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,831
Are you sure it's him?

144
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:14,335
- I thought it might be her.
- I don't think so.

145
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:17,630
Do you have evidence?

146
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:21,926
I don't need to give you evidence.
It's intuition you're paying for.

147
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,429
You okay?

148
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,473
Bueno. Absolutely.

149
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:19,085
- Am I under surveillance?
- No.

150
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:23,548
So what? Do you wanna go out with me?

151
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:27,468
It's your birthday.
Don't you have other plans?

152
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:31,347
I have to meet someone later,
but I'm hungry.

153
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,309
- Let's go and eat.
- All right.

154
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:42,150
<i>I was never scared of you.
Even when I should have been.</i>

155
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:46,904
<i>Even though my fate was in your hands,
I always trusted you.</i>

156
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:53,077
Why did you do it?

157
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:57,707
For the money. Why did you do it?

158
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,668
- What?
- Lie for me.

159
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:04,172
I don't know.

160
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,216
It's very impulsive.

161
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:11,012
I can be impulsive.

162
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:16,726
- Happy birthday.
- I love these.

163
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,812
How did you know? Is that on my file?

164
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,274
- Lucky guess.
- Fate.

165
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:29,906
Actually, I have a whole bag full of them.
For my kid.

166
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,116
- You have a kid?
- Yeah.

167
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:34,368
<i>- Chico or chica?
- Chico.</i>

168
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:37,079
Jim. His name is Jim.

169
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:40,458
I bet he's very special.

170
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,543
He is special.

171
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,880
Everybody's children are so special.

172
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:49,258
It makes you wonder where
all the ordinary grown-ups come from.

173
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:53,930
These are good.

174
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,850
You wanna come to a club?

175
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,561
Don't you have to meet someone?

176
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:04,732
- Come. I want you to.
- Why?

177
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:07,568
Because I want to corrupt you.

178
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:11,322
If you come, there's a definite risk
that you'll have a good time.

179
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:15,660
And if you don't come with me,
then you'll regret it.

180
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,373
Come on.

181
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,501
Come on.

182
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,992
- Drink?
- Vodka, rocks, please.

183
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,577
- Would you like to sing?
- No.

184
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,870
- Are you sure?
- No. I'm sure.

185
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:01,664
You don't wanna hear me sing.

186
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,841
- I was actually hoping to hear you sing.
- Why?

187
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:16,137
Someone told me
that you have a very distinctive voice.

188
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,223
What else did they say about me
behind my back?

189
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:22,476
You can take a virus
to make you more musical.

190
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,021
Gives you perfect pitch.
You sing like an angel.

191
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:28,649
I tried a virus once for Mandarin Chinese.

192
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:31,861
Chinese people knew what I was saying,
but I didn't.

193
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:33,946
It was weird. I didn't like it.

194
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:41,037
I'm on a virus right now, an empathy virus.

195
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:44,582
I take an empathy virus
to help with my work.

196
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:48,210
I don't like that, that's weird.
That's like you could pick up...

197
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:50,796
- all sorts of stuff about me.
- Yeah, I can.

198
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,550
That's like wearing x-ray specs
to look at girls' underwear.

199
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:57,970
- I bought x-ray specs, they don't work.
- But you bought them?

200
00:18:58,054 --> 00:18:59,930
- Yeah.
- You wanted them to work.

201
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:03,351
I was 6 years old. I was interested
in skeletons, not underwear.

202
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:11,150
I thought you were
a natural intuitive hombre.

203
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,944
Would it make any difference?

204
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,239
<i>- Claro.
- Really?</i>

205
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:21,285
- Maria.
- Damian. Hello.

206
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,041
William, Damian. Damian, William.

207
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:29,835
<i>Darling, you got to let me know</i>

208
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:34,090
<i>Should I stay or should I go</i>

209
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,216
Hi.

210
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:39,345
<i>If you say that you are mine</i>

211
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:43,057
<i>I'll be here till the end of time</i>

212
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:45,893
William is helping me
celebrate my birthday.

213
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:47,770
- It's your birthday?
- Yeah.

214
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:49,563
- I didn't know.
- That's okay.

215
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:53,025
William is okay.
William knows about our secret.

216
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,738
That's the one that will take me.

217
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:02,743
You should kiss William, too,
because he helped.

218
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:06,789
<i>If I go there will be trouble</i>

219
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:09,208
Tell him what you're going to do with it.

220
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,419
I'm a naturalist. I study bats.

221
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:15,798
The finest quality of bats in this world
is in this cave in Delhi.

222
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:18,092
I wanted to see that since I was a kid.

223
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:22,763
You couldn't get cover in the normal way?

224
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:26,684
I have tried for eight years.
And only now am I going.

225
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:30,521
Usually if you can't get cover,
there's a good reason.

226
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,606
Yes, "The Sphinx knows...

227
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,483
- "best."
- "Best."

228
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:37,319
- The Sphinx knows a lot.
- Doesn't know what I know.

229
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:39,613
Some things in life can be worth the risk.

230
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:42,032
Anyone who has ever
wanted something knows...

231
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:44,618
you have to be prepared
to take a risk to get it.

232
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:46,537
I think I'll be okay.

233
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:53,502
- Good luck.
- Bye.

234
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:57,214
<i>If I go there will be trouble</i>

235
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,008
Why did you do that?

236
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:01,677
- What?
- All that, in front of me.

237
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:06,098
You know what I should do?
Arrange to have his cover withdrawn...

238
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:08,809
and I should put him al fuera and you, too.

239
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:11,854
But you're not going to, though. Are you?

240
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:15,733
Why are you being so nice to me?

241
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:18,194
Are you hoping for a reward?

242
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:21,030
How do you get the papeles out?

243
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:29,997
At the beginning of every new batch
we do a test run.

244
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,624
Then we destroy the papel.

245
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:34,835
I go in to work
and I have a fake papel under my tongue.

246
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:38,756
I destroy the fake one
and put the real papel under my tongue.

247
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:43,344
I then go to the bathroom,
put the papel into a pill, swallow it.

248
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:47,389
A couple of days later, I have the papel.

249
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,267
Impressed?

250
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:53,062
Come on, be impressed.

251
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:48,052
Thank you for bringing me home.
It's very kind of you.

252
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,448
Come in.

253
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:23,170
Beautiful. You have green fingers.

254
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:28,133
Everything is controlled scientifically.

255
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,971
Do you think that sunlight
is as dangerous as they say?

256
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:34,848
I hope not.

257
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:40,020
- Would you like a drink? A glass of water?
- Sure.

258
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:44,149
One of my fingers
is younger than the others.

259
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:46,068
- Really?
- Yeah.

260
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:49,113
- Which one?
- This one.

261
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:52,658
Do you like it?

262
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:55,786
Very much.

263
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:59,540
It's much better than the other fingers.
Definitely.

264
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:03,419
Maybe I should get them
to grow me a younger face.

265
00:25:05,963 --> 00:25:07,047
No.

266
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,218
I love the sorrows of your changing face.

267
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:13,679
Or whatever it is.

268
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:27,067
I haven't seen this book in a while.

269
00:25:28,152 --> 00:25:30,904
"In a friend one should have
one's best enemy...

270
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:35,576
"and you should be closest to him
when you resist him."

271
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,106
Look.

272
00:26:09,777 --> 00:26:12,154
It's all I've got left from my childhood.

273
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:14,990
I keep my special memories here.

274
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:19,745
- Who are they?
- My father and mother.

275
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,830
Before we left Shanghai.

276
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,629
These are people like Damian,
when I give them the papeles.

277
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,425
Now you know all my secrets.

278
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:39,014
I love to look at their faces.

279
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:42,392
They're so beautiful.

280
00:26:43,477 --> 00:26:45,229
Look at their eyes.

281
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:49,233
They have a look
that the rest of us don't have.

282
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,780
You look like them un poco.

283
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:06,458
You should go to sleep.

284
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:22,766
I don't want to go to sleep.
Please don't let me sleep.

285
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:33,402
I'll make you some coffee.

286
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:10,415
Coffee.

287
00:29:37,234 --> 00:29:39,236
<i>Said I remember</i>

288
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:42,698
<i>When we used to sit</i>

289
00:29:43,657 --> 00:29:48,161
<i>In a government yard in Trenchtown</i>

290
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:53,041
<i>And Georgie would make the firelight</i>

291
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:57,796
<i>Logwood burning through the night</i>

292
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:01,800
<i>No woman, no cry</i>

293
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:06,638
<i>No woman, no cry</i>

294
00:30:07,097 --> 00:30:10,600
I was just gonna torture the song
and now you're murdering it.

295
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:12,060
I'm tone-deaf.

296
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:15,355
You find that attractive?

297
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,457
Are you leaving?

298
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:43,003
I'm booked on a flight home.

299
00:32:44,171 --> 00:32:47,340
- What time's your flight?
- 11:00.

300
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:50,093
What will happen to Bikku?

301
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,639
He'll lose his cover.

302
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:57,893
That's bad.

303
00:32:58,268 --> 00:33:00,187
I know it's bad.

304
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:04,024
You giving out fake papers is bad.
Me letting you off is bad.

305
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:06,776
Have you ever lived outside?

306
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:13,033
I was outside for 10 years.

307
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:23,919
<i>Lo siento.</i>

308
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:49,861
I have to go.

309
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:35,740
- I need to stop at the entry checkpoint.
- Why?

310
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:39,160
I need to get more sherbet fountains.

311
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:10,442
Hi, mister.

312
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:15,280
I found this.
I thought you could put it to good use.

313
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:18,158
Thank you. Gracias. God bless you. Go.

314
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,119
Sorry.

315
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:25,415
Leave him alone.
Thank you, God bless you.

316
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:29,878
<i>If we had enough information...</i>

317
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:32,839
<i>we could predict
the consequences of our actions.</i>

318
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:36,134
<i>Would you want to know?</i>

319
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:39,512
<i>If you kiss that girl,
if you talk to that man...</i>

320
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:43,516
<i>if you take that job or marry that woman
or steal that papel?</i>

321
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:46,019
<i>If we knew what would happen in the end...</i>

322
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:49,898
<i>would we ever be able to take the
first step, to make the first move?</i>

323
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,615
Hello, I'm home.

324
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:10,168
- Did you have a good trip?
- It went all right.

325
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:17,300
Daddy! Where have you been?

326
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:21,179
<i>They'd be pleased to see you.
Your wife, your special boy.</i>

327
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:24,391
<i>They'd want to know all your news...</i>

328
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:27,519
<i>and will be glad to have you home,
safe and sound.</i>

329
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:33,024
- Want me to guess what you're thinking?
- Yeah.

330
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:39,864
<i>- Bicycle.
- Si.</i>

331
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:49,040
<i>I can't answer right now,
so leave a message.</i>

332
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:53,586
It's William, call me.
Just to let me know you're okay.

333
00:36:55,088 --> 00:36:56,172
Bye.

334
00:37:11,104 --> 00:37:13,231
- Are you tired?
- Yeah.

335
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,778
<i>Did you think about me at all?</i>

336
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:23,324
<i>Did you try to imagine
what was happening to me?</i>

337
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:26,745
<i>Does an empathy virus work long-distance?</i>

338
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:04,282
<i>Maria Gonzalez, age 25.
Employee of the Sphinx.</i>

339
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:08,119
<i>Nurture father: Christian Gunter.</i>

340
00:38:08,578 --> 00:38:12,832
<i>Born in Freeport of Jebel Ali.
Transferred to Shanghai.</i>

341
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:15,960
<i>He was exiled for financial irregularities.</i>

342
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:19,297
<i>Recorded in Kunming, Dhanbad...</i>

343
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,841
<i>Quetta and Baghdad.</i>

344
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:25,595
<i>Presumed to be returning
to the Freeport of Jebel Ali.</i>

345
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:29,849
<i>Carmen Gonzalez returned to Shanghai.</i>

346
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:33,728
<i>Remarried to-</i>

347
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:36,940
<i>Maria Gonzalez.</i>

348
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:40,276
<i>Height: 165 cms.</i>

349
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:43,196
Buenos dias. De Souza wants to talk to you.

350
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:45,865
- What about?
- There's been a fatality in Asia.

351
00:38:45,949 --> 00:38:48,451
A guy was traveling on one of the papers
from Shanghai.

352
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:52,247
- She's waiting. You want a coffee?
- No, thanks.

353
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:56,376
<i>- Hello.
- Someone died yesterday.</i>

354
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:58,920
I heard. Do you have details?

355
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:02,757
<i>Hombre had una cosa about bats,
wanted to go to Delhi.</i>

356
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:05,802
<i>The place to be if you like bats, apparently.</i>

357
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:11,349
<i>Couldn't get cover because he had an
ineluctable disposition to Ward's Disease.</i>

358
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,143
<i>Do you know it?</i>

359
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,145
<i>- No.
- It makes you bleed to death.</i>

360
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:18,398
<i>Most people in Delhi are immune,
which is why...</i>

361
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:22,569
this hombre couldn't get cover,
which is why he bought fake papeles...

362
00:39:22,986 --> 00:39:25,280
<i>which is why he bled to death yesterday.</i>

363
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:29,576
<i>- What was his name?
- Alekan. Damian Alekan.</i>

364
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:35,832
<i>The papeles come from the same printer
as the ones you investigated.</i>

365
00:39:38,585 --> 00:39:39,878
I'm sorry.

366
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:43,339
<i>Get back, make it right,
then you won't have to be sorry anymore.</i>

367
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:47,135
<i>- Is there someone else you can send?
- Why would you want me to do that?</i>

368
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:52,432
I had some trouble when I was there.
Some trouble with the virus, I think.

369
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:56,102
<i>We all have problems, William.</i>

370
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:59,522
<i>How we deal with them
is a measure of our worth.</i>

371
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:01,107
<i>Go back tomorrow.</i>

372
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,280
Damian Alekan.

373
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:32,013
- Where did you get that? Someone gave it-
- I have to go back to Shanghai.

374
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:34,140
How long will you be away?

375
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:36,267
I have a 24-hour cover.

376
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:38,853
I'll be back before you know I've gone.

377
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,813
Messed it all up.

378
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:51,300
Welcome, sir.

379
00:42:04,564 --> 00:42:07,025
Three more forged papeles reported.

380
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:09,902
One here, one in Sao Paolo, one in Delhi.

381
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:13,322
If this doesn't stop,
I could lose my own cover.

382
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:16,868
Lo siento, it's the first time
my intuition has let me down.

383
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:20,079
I think he had an accomplice.
There was a woman here last time...

384
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:22,331
- Maria Gonzalez.
- She's gone.

385
00:42:24,167 --> 00:42:26,586
What do you mean gone? Disappeared?

386
00:42:26,836 --> 00:42:28,880
I was told she had a body issue.

387
00:42:29,464 --> 00:42:31,090
It was all official.

388
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:50,276
Maria?

389
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:53,905
Video Listo Corporation.

390
00:42:54,614 --> 00:42:58,451
Hello. I just tried to get in my apartment
and the video listo no funciona.

391
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:02,038
<i>We have your number listed
as temporarily descontinuado.</i>

392
00:43:02,163 --> 00:43:04,624
Do I look descontinuado to you?

393
00:43:04,874 --> 00:43:07,627
<i>No, senor, but then I don't know
that you're the holder.</i>

394
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:11,005
- That's not my problem, is it?
- If you can give me your palabra...

395
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:14,467
<i>I can provide you with a 10-minute window
to recode your video listo.</i>

396
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:17,303
<i>- How would that be?
- That would be great, thank you.</i>

397
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:19,347
- Palabra, sir?
- Panoply.

398
00:43:27,355 --> 00:43:29,899
<i>Did you know what you were looking for?</i>

399
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:32,485
<i>Or were you hoping I had left you a clue?</i>

400
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:36,322
<i>Like Hansel and Gretel
being dragged off into the woods.</i>

401
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:40,660
Panoply.

402
00:43:46,082 --> 00:43:48,793
<i>Maria, today you have no appointments.</i>

403
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:59,303
<i>Maria, today you have a 3:15 appointment
at the Mai Lin Clinic.</i>

404
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:14,193
I'm investigating a fraud
to which Maria Gonzalez is a key witness.

405
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:17,780
I was officially informed
that she has some body issues...

406
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:19,240
and was on a happiness break.

407
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,951
She has been relocated.

408
00:44:22,118 --> 00:44:25,538
There were complications
that we couldn't deal with.

409
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:27,415
She has been sent outside.

410
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:31,752
Outside is a big place,
it would help if you were more specific.

411
00:44:32,295 --> 00:44:35,756
There's a confidentiality issue there,
I'm afraid, sir.

412
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:38,593
What was the nature of her body issue?

413
00:44:38,885 --> 00:44:42,054
There's a confidentiality issue there,
I'm afraid, sir.

414
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:44,849
Why was she summoned
for a happiness break?

415
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:48,102
Is this a training exercise?

416
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:52,190
- Are you trying to catch me out?
- You got me.

417
00:44:52,273 --> 00:44:55,693
- You didn't get me, though.
- You are top of the class.

418
00:44:57,445 --> 00:45:02,033
Very good.
Tell me something about yourself, anything.

419
00:45:02,158 --> 00:45:03,993
For the report. I have to write this up.

420
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:08,998
My mother had this job before me.

421
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:11,125
I inherited it.

422
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:16,923
How long has Miss Gonzalez
been pregnant?

423
00:45:18,633 --> 00:45:20,009
I never said that.

424
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:23,679
What type of Code 46 violation was it?

425
00:45:25,306 --> 00:45:27,433
I never mentioned Code 46.

426
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:32,271
Where is the Mai Lin Clinic?

427
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:36,442
There's a confidentiality issue there,
I'm afraid, sir.

428
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,403
Thank you for your help.

429
00:45:50,498 --> 00:45:53,876
You rented a car. The clinic was al fuera.

430
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:56,629
170 K outside the city.

431
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:07,848
<i>I imagine you like a medieval knight
on a quest.</i>

432
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:10,518
<i>A quest for me.</i>

433
00:46:30,705 --> 00:46:32,498
I'm here to see Maria Gonzalez.

434
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:35,167
<i>Lo siento,
no visitors are permitted until 6:00.</i>

435
00:46:35,293 --> 00:46:39,255
I'm from Westerfields.
She's a key witness in a major fraud case.

436
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:41,966
<i>- Nombre?
- Maria Gonzalez.</i>

437
00:46:42,258 --> 00:46:45,636
<i>- Tu nombre?
- William Geld. I'm with Westerfields.</i>

438
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,013
I need your print here.

439
00:46:47,138 --> 00:46:49,265
It's a very urgent situation.

440
00:46:49,682 --> 00:46:51,642
I know. Nombre and print.

441
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:57,898
I can tell by looking at you
that you are not just...

442
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:00,443
a keypad presser.

443
00:47:00,693 --> 00:47:02,028
You can make judgments.

444
00:47:02,111 --> 00:47:04,864
Si, and I have made my
judgment about you.

445
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:08,075
If you don't have authorization
for this place...

446
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:11,704
Tell me one thing about yourself.
Anything at all.

447
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:12,788
Okay.

448
00:47:13,456 --> 00:47:14,874
I'm tired.

449
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:18,169
I have conversations like this one a lot.
Is that enough?

450
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:22,798
If I were able to guess your palabra,
would you be impressed?

451
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:24,759
I would be dumbfounded.

452
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:28,679
- It's "Garamond."
- No, it's not. It's nothing like that.

453
00:47:29,597 --> 00:47:32,683
Did you have an empathy virus?
It doesn't work here.

454
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:35,227
That's why you've got a cold. Here.

455
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:38,564
We use antiviral bacteria.

456
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:41,067
The institute is infested with streptococci.

457
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:44,945
You know, here on the outside...

458
00:47:45,613 --> 00:47:48,240
we do not have access
to some of the pleasures...

459
00:47:48,324 --> 00:47:51,243
that are so freely available on the inside.

460
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:57,958
I have these.

461
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:06,092
- The gold ones are particularly bueno.
- I don't need wealth.

462
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:09,345
I just need a little encouragement.

463
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:15,935
You have a very
sophisticated security system here.

464
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:18,938
Claro.
We have all categories of cases here.

465
00:48:19,772 --> 00:48:22,566
What is Maria Gonzalez here for?

466
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,569
You're investigating her case, n'est-ce pas?

467
00:48:25,653 --> 00:48:28,614
I'm investigating a fraud case.
She's a witness.

468
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:32,118
She's had a finger-graft.

469
00:48:39,542 --> 00:48:41,460
Maria Gonzalez?

470
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:45,131
Take a seat.

471
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:49,510
- You okay?
- I'm good.

472
00:48:49,844 --> 00:48:53,055
If this is about my finger,
then I don't want to prosecute.

473
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:57,309
This is not about your finger.

474
00:49:00,813 --> 00:49:03,232
I need to speak to Miss Gonzalez alone.

475
00:49:03,524 --> 00:49:05,526
You have no authorization.

476
00:49:07,528 --> 00:49:08,571
Okay.

477
00:49:15,411 --> 00:49:18,164
I'm investigating an incident
at your place of work.

478
00:49:18,289 --> 00:49:21,167
Fraudulent papeles
issued from your printer.

479
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:28,841
In the last 14 days,
three people have died...

480
00:49:29,884 --> 00:49:32,636
while traveling from papeles...

481
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:35,181
issued from your printer at the Sphinx.

482
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:41,562
The people who come to us,
they're all doing something dangerous.

483
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:45,566
You have to expect that, unfortunately,
some of them won't make it.

484
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:48,694
One of them...

485
00:49:49,737 --> 00:49:54,033
Damian Alekan, bled to death.
He was fond of bats. Remember him?

486
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:57,620
No.

487
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:00,247
Damian Alekan? You met him at a bar.

488
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:03,167
You sold him a papel
which allowed him to go to Delhi.

489
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:05,419
- When did he die?
- A week ago.

490
00:50:06,337 --> 00:50:08,047
I've been in here for 10 days.

491
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:11,175
All of the papeles were issued
prior to your arriving here.

492
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:18,265
I'm tired. I would like to rest.

493
00:50:20,309 --> 00:50:22,811
Miss Gonzalez is still in recovery.

494
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:36,200
Why is she in here?

495
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:39,536
And, please, do not use the word "finger"
at any point in your answer.

496
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:42,164
- Her finger-
- Was damaged and regrown...

497
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:45,167
on her family's insurance policy
22 years ago.

498
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:47,127
I know a great deal about Miss Gonzalez.

499
00:50:47,253 --> 00:50:50,214
For instance, that she was pregnant
when she came in here.

500
00:50:50,339 --> 00:50:52,633
I also know,
because you told me so yourself...

501
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:55,844
that you have no interest
in impeding my investigation.

502
00:50:57,429 --> 00:50:59,556
She violated Code 46.

503
00:51:00,933 --> 00:51:02,393
We've terminated the pregnancy...

504
00:51:02,518 --> 00:51:05,354
and taken out the memory cluster
immediately around it.

505
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:08,315
- The baby was terminated?
- There was no baby.

506
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:12,152
Just a pregnancy which is now terminated
and the memories removed.

507
00:51:16,824 --> 00:51:19,285
You've interfered...

508
00:51:20,953 --> 00:51:23,789
with the memory of a key witness
in an insurance fraud.

509
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:25,291
The memories were very local.

510
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:28,377
It's just the man, the sex act,
and the pregnancy.

511
00:51:29,253 --> 00:51:31,297
She doesn't remember the man at all?

512
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:34,174
The man, the sex, the pregnancy.
We've erased all of them.

513
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:37,011
Apart from that,
it's the same Maria Gonzalez.

514
00:51:37,428 --> 00:51:40,639
The finger is a placebo memory.
I moved it from her childhood.

515
00:51:40,723 --> 00:51:42,558
I think it's very effective.

516
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:47,646
When will she be able to leave?

517
00:51:48,272 --> 00:51:49,732
She's due to leave tomorrow.

518
00:51:49,857 --> 00:51:53,652
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you
to release her to me now.

519
00:51:58,032 --> 00:52:00,492
<i>Can you miss someone
you don't remember?</i>

520
00:52:00,618 --> 00:52:04,038
<i>Can one moment or experience
ever disappear completely?</i>

521
00:52:04,872 --> 00:52:08,876
<i>Or does it always exist somewhere,
waiting to be discovered?</i>

522
00:52:10,586 --> 00:52:12,838
- Wait, I've forgotten something.
- What?

523
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:17,009
- A valise. It's very important to me.
- It's in the back. Voila.

524
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,440
Is that what you're going to do?

525
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:34,318
Put me al fuera with them?

526
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:40,032
You've been outside before.
Spent 10 years al fuera.

527
00:52:40,616 --> 00:52:42,826
Didn't come back inside till you were 14.

528
00:52:43,035 --> 00:52:44,703
You really did your homework.

529
00:52:45,621 --> 00:52:50,250
You can't sing, you like sherbet fountains,
you like to grow real plants from seed.

530
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:54,213
God, I must have been
your favorite subject at school.

531
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:56,173
You hate the desert.

532
00:52:59,718 --> 00:53:01,679
<i>I always hated the desert.</i>

533
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:05,808
<i>Even at college,
studying the Roadrunner cartoons...</i>

534
00:53:05,933 --> 00:53:07,434
<i>I had to look away.</i>

535
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:13,399
I've always wondered why the coyote
didn't just go out and buy a roadrunner.

536
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:16,235
If he had enough money
for rocket-powered roller skates...

537
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:18,779
he had enough money to buy a roadrunner.

538
00:53:20,781 --> 00:53:22,491
How did you do that?

539
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:25,202
What?

540
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:30,165
I was thinking something and
you heard me. That is weird.

541
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:32,668
Intuition.

542
00:53:33,085 --> 00:53:36,422
I can feel what you're thinking.

543
00:53:36,547 --> 00:53:40,426
I don't believe in mind-reading.
I think it is all a trick.

544
00:53:40,676 --> 00:53:42,719
It's not a trick. It is a gift.

545
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:46,223
What am I thinking now?

546
00:53:52,146 --> 00:53:54,940
You're thinking of Damian Alekan.

547
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:12,499
- Have you been here before?
- Once.

548
00:54:14,626 --> 00:54:15,961
You like it?

549
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:18,172
I was only here a day.

550
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:23,427
But, yes, I liked it very much.

551
00:54:55,042 --> 00:54:56,710
Excuse the mess.

552
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:10,974
Come here.

553
00:55:20,526 --> 00:55:21,735
Sit down.

554
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:38,877
That's Damian.

555
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:43,257
Recognize him now?

556
00:55:50,848 --> 00:55:53,058
I remember he wanted to go to Delhi.

557
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:57,396
And I remember the look on his face
when I gave him the papel.

558
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:02,442
He tried for years to get one officially
and he couldn't get one.

559
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:21,712
I was there when you met Damian.
I was with you in the bar.

560
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:25,674
I don't understand.

561
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:28,927
You don't remember
because they erased your memory.

562
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:33,056
I don't know what you're talking about.

563
00:56:35,267 --> 00:56:38,061
I came to Shanghai to investigate a fraud.

564
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:41,899
I knew you were guilty.

565
00:56:44,276 --> 00:56:46,653
But then I fell in love with you.

566
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:57,164
Why would they erase my memory of you?

567
00:57:00,459 --> 00:57:01,835
I don't know.

568
00:57:15,015 --> 00:57:16,975
My cosa. Where's my cosa?

569
00:57:23,607 --> 00:57:27,361
- I can't find my cosa.
- Come here. You haven't lost anything.

570
00:57:27,486 --> 00:57:28,528
Calm down.

571
00:57:28,654 --> 00:57:30,989
- I can't find my cosa.
- It's okay.

572
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:33,742
I don't know where my cosa is.

573
00:57:37,955 --> 00:57:39,790
Will you stay with me?

574
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:49,466
- I'm so tired.
- I'll stay with you until you wake up.

575
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:54,846
- What is it?
- It'll help you sleep.

576
00:58:01,353 --> 00:58:05,023
- I don't understand anything.
- I don't understand anything either.

577
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:12,155
<i>My father used to tell me stories
as I fell asleep.</i>

578
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:16,201
<i>Stories about Jebel Ali and the Arabian Sea.</i>

579
00:58:19,371 --> 00:58:21,623
<i>Stories of magic and adventure.</i>

580
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:24,668
<i>He used to live there...</i>

581
00:58:24,793 --> 00:58:28,922
<i>and believed that if we could return,
everything would be all right.</i>

582
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:34,094
<i>Everything would be like it used to be
before we were exiled.</i>

583
00:58:39,266 --> 00:58:41,393
<i>And in my dreams I was there.</i>

584
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:55,449
Sample, please.

585
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:57,701
Thank you.

586
00:59:01,038 --> 00:59:04,291
I'm pleased to tell you that I've
screened both your sets of genes...

587
00:59:04,416 --> 00:59:06,376
and there are no Code 46 issues.

588
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:10,338
It is perfectly safe for you to marry.
In fact, I'd recommend it.

589
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:13,467
You both have the code
for high intelligence.

590
00:59:14,718 --> 00:59:17,012
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

591
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:20,891
Do you know this woman?

592
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:24,102
I'm looking for her.

593
00:59:24,311 --> 00:59:27,522
You must have found her, hombre,
if you have her hair.

594
00:59:27,606 --> 00:59:30,275
It was given to me by relatives.

595
00:59:32,444 --> 00:59:36,072
- What's your relationship to this woman?
- I just want to know about her.

596
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:39,242
You can't liaise with her.

597
00:59:39,785 --> 00:59:42,537
See this? This is your DNA.

598
00:59:43,497 --> 00:59:45,582
A 50% match with the hair samples.

599
00:59:46,166 --> 00:59:47,501
And here...

600
00:59:48,919 --> 00:59:50,504
is the DNA of your mother.

601
00:59:50,629 --> 00:59:53,840
A 100% match. Genetically identical.

602
00:59:54,341 --> 00:59:58,053
Any liaison with this woman
would be a Code 46 violation.

603
00:59:59,846 --> 01:00:02,724
- How can that be?
- Anything's possible in vitro.

604
01:00:03,308 --> 01:00:06,520
Your mother was one of a batch
of 24 cloned fetuses.

605
01:00:06,812 --> 01:00:09,815
This hair is from your mother
or one of her genetic twins.

606
01:00:10,398 --> 01:00:14,528
- This woman is identical to my mother?
- No.

607
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:18,573
Diet...

608
01:00:18,907 --> 01:00:22,410
climate, environment, accident...

609
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:25,247
surgery, the stars, God.

610
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:28,208
We aren't prisoners of our genes.

611
01:00:29,835 --> 01:00:32,045
Is this hair from your mother?

612
01:00:33,088 --> 01:00:34,089
No.

613
01:00:35,841 --> 01:00:39,136
- Are you in love with this woman?
- Why?

614
01:00:40,679 --> 01:00:42,681
- Is she pregnant?
- No.

615
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:47,435
- Were you naturally conceived?
- In vitro.

616
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:51,648
Your nurture parents will have
your records, if that's any help.

617
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:53,191
They're dead.

618
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:55,360
I'm sorry.

619
01:01:26,057 --> 01:01:28,143
<i>If we're frightened, we run.</i>

620
01:01:28,393 --> 01:01:30,020
<i>It's our instinct.</i>

621
01:01:30,395 --> 01:01:34,232
<i>Adrenalin pumps round the body,
the muscles contract...</i>

622
01:01:34,316 --> 01:01:37,402
<i>our heart beats faster, and we run.</i>

623
01:01:38,945 --> 01:01:40,655
<i>We run for our lives.</i>

624
01:01:40,739 --> 01:01:42,324
<i>We run for safety...</i>

625
01:01:42,449 --> 01:01:46,119
<i>for our home, our families, our loved ones.</i>

626
01:01:49,122 --> 01:01:50,582
Sylvie.

627
01:01:50,665 --> 01:01:53,501
<i>You're driving.
I don't want you to drive and call.</i>

628
01:01:53,752 --> 01:01:56,254
I'm on my way to the airport.
I'll be home tomorrow.

629
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:58,673
<i>- Catch the bad guy?
- Every time.</i>

630
01:01:59,758 --> 01:02:02,177
<i>William, I love you.</i>

631
01:02:03,136 --> 01:02:05,221
<i>I love you, too.</i>

632
01:02:05,347 --> 01:02:07,766
<i>Daddy? Hello. How are you?</i>

633
01:02:09,768 --> 01:02:11,728
<i>- Love you.
- Me you.</i>

634
01:02:12,312 --> 01:02:14,773
<i>See you later.</i>

635
01:02:38,505 --> 01:02:40,799
Hi. I need a ticket to Seattle.

636
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:44,803
It's completely red, sir. It's out of date.

637
01:02:45,345 --> 01:02:47,472
See? You're not covered for the Asea area.

638
01:02:47,931 --> 01:02:50,976
But I don't wanna be here.
I wanna leave, I wanna go home.

639
01:02:51,101 --> 01:02:53,728
- I'm covered for home, right?
- I really don't know, sir.

640
01:02:53,812 --> 01:02:55,105
I am covered for home.

641
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:59,275
But you're not at home, sir.
You're aqui in Shanghai without cover.

642
01:02:59,526 --> 01:03:03,279
I got an idea. Why don't we just kick me out
in the general direction of home?

643
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:07,409
You can't fly uncovered, sir.
You can't be in the Asea area without cover.

644
01:03:07,534 --> 01:03:10,620
What am I gonna do,
piss out the window at 60,000 feet?

645
01:03:10,704 --> 01:03:14,165
I really wouldn't know enough
about your character to say, sir.

646
01:03:15,083 --> 01:03:18,169
Maybe I can guess something
about your character.

647
01:03:18,670 --> 01:03:20,297
These are particularly fun.

648
01:03:20,755 --> 01:03:22,674
I'm afraid you guessed wrong, sir.

649
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:26,219
I'm a Christian scientist.
I don't believe in drugs or coffee.

650
01:03:26,678 --> 01:03:27,804
Damn.

651
01:03:28,722 --> 01:03:30,265
I'm all out of Bibles.

652
01:04:05,258 --> 01:04:06,551
<i>Can I come in?</i>

653
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:07,886
Can I stop you?

654
01:04:17,771 --> 01:04:19,105
I need your help.

655
01:04:19,606 --> 01:04:21,024
Where have you been?

656
01:04:21,733 --> 01:04:23,777
Lo siento. I had something to do.

657
01:04:25,904 --> 01:04:29,741
I shouldn't be in Shanghai.
I should be in Seattle.

658
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:32,077
You knew that last night.

659
01:04:32,452 --> 01:04:34,704
- I have to go.
- So go.

660
01:04:35,789 --> 01:04:37,040
I can't.

661
01:04:37,749 --> 01:04:41,419
My papel was red. I can't get out.

662
01:04:47,342 --> 01:04:49,094
You tried already?

663
01:04:49,427 --> 01:04:51,388
You were just going to disappear.

664
01:04:57,936 --> 01:04:59,312
You say that too much.

665
01:04:59,813 --> 01:05:02,315
I need to go home.

666
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:09,697
<i>- You've got a family.
- Si.</i>

667
01:05:11,491 --> 01:05:13,910
<i>- Chico or chica?
- Chico.</i>

668
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:22,252
He must think you're a real hero
for catching bad guys like me.

669
01:05:23,586 --> 01:05:25,046
Something like that.

670
01:05:29,384 --> 01:05:32,303
Well, you know what they say:
"The Sphinx knows best."

671
01:05:35,306 --> 01:05:37,934
Maybe there's a reason you can't go home.

672
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:44,149
It's a fake, okay?

673
01:05:44,691 --> 01:05:47,110
I have to swap it for a genuine papel.

674
01:05:53,241 --> 01:05:55,577
I'll meet you at the airport at 7:00, okay?

675
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:00,206
Come on.

676
01:06:17,223 --> 01:06:20,768
My name is Maria Gonzalez
and I have an access problem.

677
01:06:20,852 --> 01:06:23,688
I have a new finger
and it needs to be recoded.

678
01:06:23,771 --> 01:06:26,399
<i>- Just hold on a moment, please?
- Gracias.</i>

679
01:06:30,528 --> 01:06:33,573
<i>- Buenos dias.
- Bueno. So good to see you.</i>

680
01:06:33,865 --> 01:06:35,241
I have an access problem.

681
01:06:35,366 --> 01:06:38,203
I have a new finger
and I need it to be recoded.

682
01:06:38,286 --> 01:06:40,830
I know. You've been relocated.

683
01:06:41,915 --> 01:06:43,833
- Sorry?
- You have been relocated.

684
01:06:43,917 --> 01:06:45,502
You will work here now.

685
01:06:46,211 --> 01:06:48,213
Why don't you come inside?

686
01:06:54,469 --> 01:06:57,388
<i>- William, where are you?
- Still in Shanghai.</i>

687
01:06:57,889 --> 01:06:59,224
<i>Isn't your cover out?</i>

688
01:06:59,432 --> 01:07:01,726
<i>- I've extended it.
- No, you haven't.</i>

689
01:07:02,268 --> 01:07:05,230
<i>- Where is Maria Gonzalez?
- No lo se.</i>

690
01:07:05,313 --> 01:07:09,067
<i>Why did you remove her from Mai Lin Clinic
without authorization?</i>

691
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:11,194
<i>- She was a suspect.
- Was?</i>

692
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:14,030
Is.

693
01:07:14,614 --> 01:07:16,574
<i>You seem upset, William.</i>

694
01:07:17,075 --> 01:07:19,619
<i>Report to the Shanghai office, today.</i>

695
01:07:20,161 --> 01:07:22,080
<i>They will take over the case.</i>

696
01:07:54,779 --> 01:07:57,824
Get me whatever you can,
but get it today, yeah?

697
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:22,218
It's a single exit cover. Valid for today only.

698
01:10:23,511 --> 01:10:25,346
Seattle flights leave from Zone C.

699
01:10:28,891 --> 01:10:30,560
I do remember you.

700
01:10:31,853 --> 01:10:33,354
From a dream.

701
01:10:35,314 --> 01:10:37,024
From my birthday dream.

702
01:10:46,325 --> 01:10:47,827
You should go home.

703
01:10:55,042 --> 01:10:56,043
No.

704
01:11:10,725 --> 01:11:12,268
Two for Jebel Ali.

705
01:11:12,393 --> 01:11:14,395
- Which flight, sir?
- Next flight.

706
01:11:14,854 --> 01:11:16,230
Do you have cover?

707
01:11:16,355 --> 01:11:17,732
I'm resident here.

708
01:11:18,775 --> 01:11:21,235
Sorry, I forgot. It's my new finger.

709
01:11:23,446 --> 01:11:26,491
Okay. Thanks for choosing
Pan Worldwide Airways.

710
01:11:26,574 --> 01:11:28,326
Have a safe journey.

711
01:11:32,455 --> 01:11:37,126
<i>I'd always dreamt of Jebel Ali.
The Jebel Ali of my father's stories.</i>

712
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:42,089
<i>He told me you could do anything there,
as long as you wanted it enough.</i>

713
01:12:07,949 --> 01:12:09,450
You know what?

714
01:12:10,284 --> 01:12:15,039
Every time I ever imagined this,
I always imagined being with you.

715
01:12:15,831 --> 01:12:17,542
Even though we'd never met.

716
01:12:30,972 --> 01:12:32,557
- You okay?
- Yeah.

717
01:12:49,282 --> 01:12:51,659
We're looking for a place to stay.

718
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:54,203
Come, we are going, come.

719
01:13:01,669 --> 01:13:03,421
You've never been al fuera.

720
01:13:04,046 --> 01:13:07,633
<i>So I could be your guide, your teacher.</i>

721
01:13:08,092 --> 01:13:09,927
Three pakoras.

722
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:29,071
We're looking for a room. We have cover.

723
01:13:29,363 --> 01:13:33,200
No one has cover for over here.
You can't buy cover for here.

724
01:13:33,618 --> 01:13:36,537
- Residents sleep at their own risk.
- But we can have a room?

725
01:13:37,038 --> 01:13:39,749
A room, food, a game of chess.

726
01:13:40,207 --> 01:13:43,920
There's a shower through there.
You're covered in dust.

727
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:57,183
It will be noisy, lo siento.

728
01:13:58,392 --> 01:14:00,144
That doesn't matter.

729
01:14:01,312 --> 01:14:03,856
We'll sleep through anything.
We're so tired.

730
01:14:03,981 --> 01:14:06,484
- Have you come a long way?
- Yes.

731
01:14:08,986 --> 01:14:10,404
My wife made that.

732
01:14:11,447 --> 01:14:13,240
Before she passed on.

733
01:14:13,324 --> 01:14:15,952
Maybe think about her un poco
before you sleep.

734
01:14:19,246 --> 01:14:20,665
Pleasure to have you.

735
01:14:27,672 --> 01:14:29,090
Will you put this on?

736
01:14:53,239 --> 01:14:55,700
- Does your wife look like you?
- No.

737
01:14:58,452 --> 01:15:00,037
How did you meet?

738
01:15:01,497 --> 01:15:04,000
We worked together until we had Jim.

739
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:07,628
You must miss him.

740
01:15:08,295 --> 01:15:09,338
Yes.

741
01:15:11,048 --> 01:15:12,383
Sing.

742
01:15:13,259 --> 01:15:14,343
What?

743
01:15:15,636 --> 01:15:17,096
I want to hear you sing.

744
01:15:18,139 --> 01:15:19,598
I can't sing.

745
01:15:30,443 --> 01:15:31,736
I'm sorry.

746
01:15:33,487 --> 01:15:36,490
It's okay. It's not your fault.

747
01:15:45,916 --> 01:15:47,251
It's viral.

748
01:15:50,921 --> 01:15:52,381
The Sphinx...

749
01:15:54,175 --> 01:15:56,010
gave you a virus.

750
01:15:58,304 --> 01:16:01,724
What, like an anti-William virus?

751
01:16:03,184 --> 01:16:05,895
It's involuntary. It's like adrenaline.

752
01:16:08,022 --> 01:16:09,523
When you're...

753
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:13,360
scared of something,
your body gets ready to run away.

754
01:16:16,030 --> 01:16:17,823
I'm not scared of you.

755
01:16:17,907 --> 01:16:20,743
I know. But your body is.

756
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:31,545
I want you to make love to me.

757
01:16:37,968 --> 01:16:39,970
Make me make love to you.

758
01:18:07,433 --> 01:18:08,809
I love you.

759
01:19:59,086 --> 01:20:01,922
<i>You must have known
the way the virus works.</i>

760
01:20:03,257 --> 01:20:05,718
<i>Was there nothing you could do to stop me?</i>

761
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:10,931
I need to make a call.

762
01:20:11,015 --> 01:20:13,142
- All calls are logged.
- That's okay.

763
01:20:13,726 --> 01:20:16,145
<i>- Phone is la-bas.
- Gracias.</i>

764
01:20:22,318 --> 01:20:26,322
My name is Maria Gonzalez,
and I'm reporting a Code 46 violation.

765
01:20:26,697 --> 01:20:29,366
Gracias. What is your location?

766
01:20:29,950 --> 01:20:33,245
- What is this address?
- 168 Shada Perrera.

767
01:20:37,207 --> 01:20:39,668
<i>- Please wait there.
- I'll be right here.</i>

768
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:09,490
Wake up.

769
01:21:12,493 --> 01:21:13,702
Come on.

770
01:21:19,166 --> 01:21:22,836
- We have to go.
- No, I want to stay here forever.

771
01:21:34,681 --> 01:21:36,642
See? I can kiss you now.

772
01:21:37,976 --> 01:21:39,853
We have to go. Come on.

773
01:21:41,021 --> 01:21:43,524
- Something's happened.
- Okay.

774
01:21:44,525 --> 01:21:46,151
We need a car. Can you help?

775
01:21:46,527 --> 01:21:49,446
Cars are expensive here.
Even more than in the city.

776
01:21:50,155 --> 01:21:51,949
I've got these.

777
01:21:56,703 --> 01:21:59,623
I need money. People have to eat.

778
01:22:05,337 --> 01:22:06,880
That's all I've got.

779
01:22:08,841 --> 01:22:10,008
Not enough.

780
01:22:16,223 --> 01:22:20,894
Hey, Sono, take them to the sierat shop.
Tell Farrukh to give them a Padmini.

781
01:22:38,412 --> 01:22:40,164
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

782
01:23:37,221 --> 01:23:38,514
<i>I love you.</i>

783
01:23:52,110 --> 01:23:55,531
Okay, all right.
That's enough playing now. Stop.

784
01:25:04,725 --> 01:25:06,810
<i>You went before a tribunal.</i>

785
01:25:07,269 --> 01:25:10,689
<i>They decided the empathy virus
had affected your judgment.</i>

786
01:25:10,772 --> 01:25:12,941
<i>So they took away your memory of me.</i>

787
01:25:13,567 --> 01:25:15,736
<i>Just like they had wiped
my memory of you.</i>

788
01:25:18,488 --> 01:25:21,074
What does he remember about the crash?

789
01:25:21,241 --> 01:25:24,369
He knows he went to Shanghai.
He solved the case.

790
01:25:24,494 --> 01:25:26,913
On the way to the airport,
he crashed the hired car.

791
01:25:26,997 --> 01:25:30,375
As far as he's concerned,
he never went to Jebel Ali.

792
01:25:32,836 --> 01:25:35,756
- I'll leave you alone.
- Thank you.

793
01:25:43,555 --> 01:25:44,973
I've missed you.

794
01:25:46,141 --> 01:25:47,434
<i>Me, too.</i>

795
01:25:50,270 --> 01:25:51,730
It's good to see you.

796
01:25:55,859 --> 01:25:57,903
I've brought you some clothes.

797
01:26:01,573 --> 01:26:02,699
Daddy!

798
01:26:05,619 --> 01:26:07,329
Where have you been?

799
01:26:07,788 --> 01:26:09,831
Daddy did a silly thing.

800
01:26:10,207 --> 01:26:13,752
I crashed a car
but the doctors fixed him up real good.

801
01:26:19,007 --> 01:26:20,384
What am I thinking?

802
01:26:25,472 --> 01:26:26,431
I don't know.

803
01:26:27,057 --> 01:26:29,393
Boats. I'm thinking about boats.

804
01:26:31,478 --> 01:26:35,649
<i>Row, row, row your boat
gently down the stream</i>

805
01:26:37,234 --> 01:26:41,029
<i>Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily,
life is but a dream</i>

806
01:26:58,338 --> 01:27:01,466
<i>I was exiled
because I tried to cheat the Sphinx.</i>

807
01:27:02,676 --> 01:27:04,636
<i>They left me my memories.</i>

808
01:27:05,470 --> 01:27:08,181
<i>They don't care what you think
if you're al fuera.</i>

809
01:27:08,306 --> 01:27:09,683
<i>Why bother?</i>

810
01:27:10,142 --> 01:27:12,561
<i>To them, it's as though we don't exist.</i>

811
01:27:19,735 --> 01:27:21,111
Feels good.

812
01:28:57,666 --> 01:28:59,000
<i>I miss you.</i>
