1
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:31,003
Jesus christ, it gets worse all the time.
- This job doesn't get any better.

2
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:34,631
All shot in their beds, execution style.

3
00:03:35,174 --> 00:03:37,050
Only the mother shot in the head.

4
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:42,264
What time you make it?
- Give me a ballpark guess.

5
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:44,641
3:00, 3:15 ...

6
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:46,810
And that's pretty close.

7
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:48,937
Thanks.

8
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,125
How long have you been waiting?

9
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:54,211
About half an hour?
- Just a couple of minutes.

10
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,507
Over there. That's a little gardening hut.

11
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:04,096
You mean that's included?
- Sure, it could be a guest house with a little fixing up.

12
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:06,139
A guest house?
- Sure.

13
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:07,599
Come on.

14
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:09,142
Right up here.

15
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:14,273
See how much property you have?
Isn't that lovely?

16
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,695
Be careful. Don't trip.

17
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:24,616
You'll see what a beauty this is.

18
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:32,541
There's nothing like it on the market.

19
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,418
Not at this price.

20
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:40,215
Come in. Come on in.
- Thank you.

21
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:42,467
Impressive, isn't it?

22
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:45,345
Wow. I mean, that's what I call charming.

23
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,931
Come on. I'll show you the living room.
- Oh, thank you.

24
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:52,519
That's a wood-burning fireplace.

25
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:54,479
Be nice on cold nights.

26
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:01,320
That's the sunporch.

27
00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:02,779
Nice, isn't it?

28
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,366
George, I don't think ...
- Be cool.

29
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:08,160
Would you like to see the kitchen?

30
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:09,995
Yes, thank you.

31
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:11,705
This is the kitchen.

32
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,753
Nice and spacious, isn't it? Really big.
Has all the original hardware and everything works.

33
00:06:19,922 --> 00:06:21,423
Is this your first house?

34
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:25,469
We just got married.

35
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:28,472
Shall we look at the upstairs?

36
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:33,227
I like to refer to this as a fixer-upper that can be fun.

37
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,149
We can start with this, huh?

38
00:06:40,526 --> 00:06:43,445
now, this is ... an extra room.

39
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,839
This is the bathroom connecting with the next bedroom.

40
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:03,966
This is the second bedroom.

41
00:07:04,967 --> 00:07:07,678
There's a nice view of the river from here.

42
00:07:09,972 --> 00:07:14,935
If you're planning on a big family,
there are three full bedrooms plus ...
- We already have a family.

43
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:16,603
Two boys and a girl.

44
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:17,980
Great kids.

45
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:23,652
You are so bad. - What?
- Cut it out. - What?

46
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:36,290
Next is the master bedroom.

47
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:52,014
I love it.

48
00:07:53,432 --> 00:07:55,517
there's just one more floor.

49
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:01,398
See anything you like ...

50
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:08,906
we can include it in the price.

51
00:08:09,031 --> 00:08:10,908
Really?
- Sure.

52
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:20,250
This can be another bedroom ...

53
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,878
or a playroom. Whichever you prefer.

54
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:34,306
I tell you what. I think maybe we'll wander around
on our own again, now that we got the layout.

55
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:36,266
We can meet you downstairs.

56
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:39,228
How'd that be?

57
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:40,896
I ... I'll be in the kitchen.

58
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:42,898
Take your time.

59
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:44,358
We won't be long.

60
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:50,531
What do you think?

61
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:52,741
I love it.

62
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:56,119
But honey ...

63
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:59,081
$80,000?

64
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:05,587
Well, it might as well be $800,000.

65
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,216
Well ...

66
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:10,551
Now listen ...

67
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,638
The house is worth ...

68
00:09:14,972 --> 00:09:17,307
120,000 easy.

69
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:24,481
And if I move my office into that little cottage out back,
that'll save that rent. And the boathouse ...

70
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:28,610
means I won't have to shell out for mooring charges,
which they're raising by the way..

71
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:30,737
You didn't tell me that.

72
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:33,198
No, there was nothing to be done about it.

73
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:35,534
I just wish that ...

74
00:09:36,285 --> 00:09:38,537
All those people hadn't died here.

75
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:43,417
I mean. A guy ... kills his whole family?

76
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,043
Doesn't that bother you?

77
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,087
Oh yeah, sure, but ...

78
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:49,464
houses don't have memories.

79
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:53,051
I don't know.

80
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:58,640
Well, I do. The house wouldn't even be for sale.
And if it was, we couldn't afford it ...

81
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:00,100
if we had ...

82
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:02,394
tuna casseroles for a year.

83
00:10:04,146 --> 00:10:07,316
Oh, you're gonna be very happy.
It's a wonderful house.

84
00:10:07,983 --> 00:10:10,652
I'm sure they'll accept your offer.
Don't worry about a thing.

85
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:14,531
I'll handle the details.
Just ... go on and get ready to move.

86
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:17,845
They're not getting too close to the river out there?

87
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:23,016
Sounds like a regular daddy I hear over there.
- I might feel like one, if ...

88
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:26,353
that's what they started calling me instead of ...
George.

89
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:30,691
Which, I got to admit, is better than
all that "Mr. Lutz" crap they were giving me.

90
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,822
What do you wanna do with this?

91
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:40,742
Oh, I know, I know. Put it in the living room ...

92
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:45,038
on that wall there beside the bookshelf.
And the light will come through the window. Look beautiful.

93
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,207
You got it.

94
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:00,888
Voila!

95
00:12:03,265 --> 00:12:05,225
Aw, shit. Come on.

96
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:24,620
Oh, I'm tired of this damn sticky paper!
I wish I'd listened to my mother and gotten
the old-fashioned kind that you tack down.

97
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,455
Nobody likes a quitter.

98
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:29,082
But I got an idea.

99
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,587
Get a couple of beers
and go outside and play?

100
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:38,008
What are those monsters up to?

101
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:54,358
Hello?

102
00:12:55,526 --> 00:12:57,069
Anybody home?

103
00:12:58,278 --> 00:12:59,321
Hello?

104
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:05,702
George?

105
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:09,832
Kathy?

106
00:13:10,082 --> 00:13:11,583
Anybody home?

107
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:20,717
Hello?

108
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:21,695
Come on Harry, get over here.

109
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:28,804
God's peace in this house.

110
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:50,552
<i>Get out.</i>

111
00:16:57,476 --> 00:16:59,186
<i>Get out!</i>

112
00:17:56,201 --> 00:17:57,494
Amy?

113
00:17:57,953 --> 00:17:59,913
Amy, honey, dinner's ready.

114
00:18:04,293 --> 00:18:05,586
Amy?

115
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:27,649
Here ...
- No, I've got her.

116
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:29,109
You and the boys start out.

117
00:18:29,234 --> 00:18:31,904
I'll take her upstairs and ...
put her to bed.

118
00:18:39,036 --> 00:18:40,496
She wasn't outside.

119
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:43,373
Where was she?  whack.

120
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:46,084
Up be getting in there and eat your hot dog.
Come on.

121
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:47,085
Whack.

122
00:19:10,234 --> 00:19:12,110
Hello? - Hello.

123
00:19:12,945 --> 00:19:14,613
Hello, Kathy?

124
00:19:18,367 --> 00:19:20,285
Kathy, can you hear me?

125
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:22,454
Kathy?

126
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,708
Father Delaney. There's something very impor ...

127
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,878
Hello? Hello?

128
00:20:11,962 --> 00:20:12,713
Who was that?

129
00:20:12,838 --> 00:20:14,256
on the phone?

130
00:20:14,673 --> 00:20:15,465
Yeah.

131
00:20:15,591 --> 00:20:18,510
Just a bunch of static.
A bad connection or something.

132
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:21,305
I think ma bell's gone wacko again.

133
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:28,437
Probably discover it was a collect call
from Japan or someplace when the next bill comes.

134
00:20:28,687 --> 00:20:31,440
Oh, did you make sure that Amy's got her doll with her?

135
00:20:32,274 --> 00:20:34,109
Yeah, she's sleeping with it.

136
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,320
You hungry, honey?

137
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:41,867
You mean, you don't want one of those
charbroiled hot dogs I did especially for you?

138
00:20:43,827 --> 00:20:45,621
No, I'm not hungry.

139
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:52,711
Damn, it's cold in here.

140
00:20:53,545 --> 00:20:57,007
I felt cold a bit earlier, but I think I've warmed up now.

141
00:20:59,468 --> 00:21:02,054
It says 72. Feels like 32.

142
00:21:02,763 --> 00:21:03,972
Do you know what I think it is?

143
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:08,143
I think there's a ... draft that comes up
from the basement through that door down there.

144
00:21:12,564 --> 00:21:15,025
This house is supposed to be well-insulated.

145
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:17,110
They'll nickel-and-dime you to death.

146
00:21:17,611 --> 00:21:18,529
Huh?

147
00:22:10,372 --> 00:22:11,540
Matt?

148
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:13,750
Are you all right?

149
00:22:13,876 --> 00:22:15,002
Yeah.

150
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:17,296
Did you hurt yourself?

151
00:22:17,588 --> 00:22:18,505
No.

152
00:22:19,006 --> 00:22:20,591
Those stairs are tricky.

153
00:22:20,716 --> 00:22:21,675
Come on.

154
00:22:21,967 --> 00:22:23,510
I'll take you upstairs.

155
00:22:23,886 --> 00:22:26,388
We'll check this all out tomorrow, huh?

156
00:23:10,891 --> 00:23:13,185
I'm sorry, baby. I didn't mean to scare you.

157
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:17,648
I look at you all the time.

158
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:20,067
I can't get used to you.

159
00:23:24,988 --> 00:23:26,240
who loves you?

160
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:30,869
I'm lucky.

161
00:23:32,287 --> 00:23:33,330
Come here.

162
00:23:33,497 --> 00:23:35,999
I just wanted to clean up first.

163
00:23:47,302 --> 00:23:49,513
I love the way you smell right now.

164
00:24:00,649 --> 00:24:02,192
I love you.

165
00:24:03,318 --> 00:24:05,070
I love you back.

166
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:16,957
You make me feel like a kid in the backseat of a car.

167
00:24:25,924 --> 00:24:27,509
I want us to work.


168
00:24:27,968 --> 00:24:31,346
I want to be the best.
I don't want you to have any regrets.

169
00:24:32,848 --> 00:24:34,516
I love you, Kathy.

170
00:25:32,616 --> 00:25:34,910
I wanna go home.

171
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:42,501
Mommy, I wanna go home.
- Honey, come on. What's the trouble?
Come on. Back to bed.

172
00:25:44,002 --> 00:25:46,296
This is our home. Don't you know that?

173
00:25:48,257 --> 00:25:49,842
Here we go.

174
00:25:52,219 --> 00:25:54,346
There you go, sweetie.

175
00:25:54,721 --> 00:25:56,932
What's the matter? Mean dreams?

176
00:26:00,435 --> 00:26:01,854
Sleep tight.

177
00:26:42,436 --> 00:26:44,396
It's not so easy, is it?

178
00:26:46,148 --> 00:26:47,399
Well ...

179
00:26:47,566 --> 00:26:52,070
I guess people have had to deal with this ever
since Adam and Eve got kicked out of the garden.

180
00:26:54,573 --> 00:26:56,408
I'll just have to learn to live with it.

181
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:02,998
Thank you.

182
00:28:57,738 --> 00:28:59,907
You're one hell of a watchdog here.

183
00:29:03,619 --> 00:29:04,870
Come on, boy.

184
00:29:05,621 --> 00:29:06,497
Come on.

185
00:29:27,643 --> 00:29:30,145
What do you say, Harry?
It looks okay, huh?

186
00:30:41,675 --> 00:30:42,759
George.

187
00:31:14,791 --> 00:31:16,084
Don't ever do that.

188
00:31:17,044 --> 00:31:19,421
Not to a man with an axe in his hand.

189
00:31:19,755 --> 00:31:21,924
I just thought maybe I could get a little help.

190
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,302
Look what you made me do.

191
00:31:25,427 --> 00:31:26,803
I made you do?

192
00:31:26,929 --> 00:31:29,973
There's a week's worth of groceries
rolling down the walk.

193
00:31:30,224 --> 00:31:32,184
Wait a minute till I finish this up.

194
00:31:32,851 --> 00:31:37,481
George, "finish"? You have got enough wood here
to heat the whole south shore!

195
00:31:51,411 --> 00:31:52,371
You take this.

196
00:31:53,372 --> 00:31:54,665
I'll get the rest.

197
00:31:54,873 --> 00:31:55,874
I love you.

198
00:32:02,172 --> 00:32:03,298
Broke a bulb.

199
00:32:07,594 --> 00:32:12,933
Hey, who drinks this fancy kind of tea around here?
- Oh, that's for aunt Helena.
She's coming by around 2:00.

200
00:32:14,184 --> 00:32:15,269
Oh, give me a break.
-

201
00:32:15,394 --> 00:32:19,189
Oh, come on, George, be nice.
This is a big event in my family.

202
00:32:19,523 --> 00:32:23,235
We've always been a bunch of renters.
This is the first time anyone's bought a house.

203
00:32:23,777 --> 00:32:26,488
Damn regimental inspection and we're not ready.

204
00:33:22,044 --> 00:33:24,004
Sweetie pie, you scared me.

205
00:33:24,129 --> 00:33:25,005
What do you want?

206
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,925
My friend Jody wants to play upstairs.

207
00:33:28,091 --> 00:33:30,260
Huh, Jody?
See?

208
00:33:30,802 --> 00:33:33,138
Well, you and Jody go on up and enjoy yourself.

209
00:33:33,347 --> 00:33:35,807
And does your friend Jody like sugar cookies too?

210
00:33:37,267 --> 00:33:39,770
I don't think so.
- No?

211
00:33:41,605 --> 00:33:42,898
Off you go.

212
00:33:59,706 --> 00:34:04,753
<i>Hello, this is Kathy Lutz.
Could I speak with father Delaney, please?
- I'm sorry Mrs. Lutz.</i>

213
00:34:04,878 --> 00:34:07,047
The father's not feeling very well today.

214
00:34:07,297 --> 00:34:08,924
He's asleep right now.

215
00:34:09,842 --> 00:34:12,052
This is father Bolen. May I help you anyway?

216
00:34:12,177 --> 00:34:14,179
Oh, father Bolen, um ...

217
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:17,641
He was supposed to come by
and bless the house yesterday, but ...

218
00:34:17,766 --> 00:34:22,604
it can wait till he feels better. I hope he's not too sick.
- Oh, I think it's just one of those flu things.

219
00:34:23,188 --> 00:34:24,481
But Mrs. Lutz ...

220
00:34:24,773 --> 00:34:26,900
the father was at your house yesterday.

221
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:29,444
We were expecting him, but he never showed up.

222
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:31,572
Well, I know he left to go there.

223
00:34:31,697 --> 00:34:34,074
<i>He didn't come. We waited all day.</i>

224
00:34:34,616 --> 00:34:36,451
Must have been some kind of mix-up.

225
00:34:36,618 --> 00:34:42,082
<i>Oh, well, no big deal. Just tell him
hi and ... and that we hope he's feeling better.</i>

226
00:34:42,207 --> 00:34:43,125
I sure will.

227
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,626
Thank you for calling.

228
00:35:17,618 --> 00:35:19,661
I'll go check Amy's bathroom.

229
00:35:21,371 --> 00:35:24,082
Oh, boy, it's stink!

230
00:35:39,765 --> 00:35:41,350
Kathy!

231
00:35:42,184 --> 00:35:45,812
Go downstairs and let your aunt Helena in.
And don't tell her anything about this, ok.

232
00:35:45,938 --> 00:35:50,567
Do we have to? - She's always pinching!
- Yes, you have to go now! - Come on. - Go on.

233
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,694
And be polite.

234
00:35:58,575 --> 00:36:01,870
Well, hello, Matthew ...

235
00:36:02,454 --> 00:36:05,749
and Gregory and Harry.

236
00:36:05,874 --> 00:36:09,211
Where's your mother, dear?
- She said she'll be down in a minute.

237
00:36:46,832 --> 00:36:48,125
Aunt Helena?

238
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:49,334
Kathleen.
- What?

239
00:36:49,459 --> 00:36:55,507
I'm sorry. I ... I must have set it too near the edge.
I ... I have to go.

240
00:36:55,632 --> 00:36:56,550
I don't understand.

241
00:36:56,675 --> 00:36:59,178
I don't feel well at all.
- Look ...

242
00:36:59,636 --> 00:37:03,807
I bought your favorite tea and I'll make you a cup.
- I have to go.

243
00:37:03,932 --> 00:37:07,853
I really feel terrible.
- If you just rested a while, you'd feel a lot ... - I can't stay!

244
00:37:07,978 --> 00:37:13,609
Please, stay. - No, I cannot stay. I don't feel well. I don't.
- You can just rest and ...

245
00:37:14,026 --> 00:37:18,780
I can't stay. Forgive me.
- George, please make her st ...

246
00:39:00,465 --> 00:39:01,508
Babe ...

247
00:39:12,144 --> 00:39:14,271
Aren't you gonna come to bed?
- In a minute.

248
00:39:15,564 --> 00:39:17,065
The fire went out.

249
00:39:18,442 --> 00:39:19,902
Are you still cold?

250
00:39:25,365 --> 00:39:27,367
Hope you're not coming down with something.

251
00:39:30,454 --> 00:39:31,872
I'll be all right.

252
00:39:33,123 --> 00:39:35,709
I gotta stay healthy for your brother's wedding.

253
00:39:45,969 --> 00:39:47,846
Your hair's getting long.

254
00:39:52,142 --> 00:39:54,686
You know what? Maybe you should sleep in tomorrow.

255
00:39:56,063 --> 00:39:57,564
I got work to do.

256
00:39:58,106 --> 00:40:00,859
I don't want to be up to my ass in boxes forever.

257
00:40:12,329 --> 00:40:13,539
I'm sorry.

258
00:40:16,959 --> 00:40:18,919
I don't know what the hell's the matter with me.

259
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:23,966
Silly, this happens all the time.
- Not to me, it doesn't.

260
00:40:24,132 --> 00:40:27,344
Hey, stop pushing.
You don't have to prove anything to me.

261
00:40:43,986 --> 00:40:45,487
Turn out the light.

262
00:40:46,738 --> 00:40:48,323
Turn out the light.

263
00:40:56,957 --> 00:40:58,250
I love you.

264
00:40:59,126 --> 00:41:00,836
I love you back.

265
00:41:25,611 --> 00:41:27,654
She was shot in the head!

266
00:41:32,701 --> 00:41:33,619
No.

267
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:36,788
You all right?

268
00:42:05,984 --> 00:42:07,486
Tell me something, father.

269
00:42:07,945 --> 00:42:08,862
What?

270
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,115
Why couldn't this wait till tomorrow?

271
00:42:13,242 --> 00:42:14,827
I don't know. I ...

272
00:42:15,994 --> 00:42:19,206
All I know is I have to get back to that house.,That's ...

273
00:42:22,209 --> 00:42:23,585
Are you feeling all right, father?

274
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:25,838
I'm fine, fine, fine.

275
00:42:32,636 --> 00:42:33,470
Father!

276
00:42:34,012 --> 00:42:36,181
What's the matter?
- Something wrong with the steering wheel!

277
00:42:39,309 --> 00:42:40,644
I can't move the wheel!

278
00:42:53,657 --> 00:42:55,159
What's wrong with this thing?

279
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:33,906
Harry, be quiet!

280
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:36,366
Be quiet!

281
00:43:44,541 --> 00:43:45,626
Come on.

282
00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:00,307
Kathy!

283
00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:08,816
Will you check this for me, please? It's got to come to
1,500 bucks for the caterer. The sucker wants cash.
- Jimmy, will you relax?

284
00:44:08,941 --> 00:44:11,401
You've counted it about a thousand times.

285
00:44:17,908 --> 00:44:19,660
You sure do look terrific.

286
00:44:29,336 --> 00:44:31,880
You're not gonna start to cry already?

287
00:44:35,843 --> 00:44:40,055
It's just that, yesterday.
I was riding you around on the back of my bike ...

288
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:42,266
and now you're getting married.

289
00:44:43,016 --> 00:44:44,560
Sure I am.

290
00:44:48,939 --> 00:44:51,650
I'm just real happy for you. That's all, honey.

291
00:44:59,491 --> 00:45:01,451
Hey, there he is.

292
00:45:03,036 --> 00:45:06,540
George, you look terrible.
- So, she keeps telling me.

293
00:45:06,665 --> 00:45:10,627
Oh, it's just some kind of flu virus going around.
Amy's got it too. It's nothing.

294
00:45:10,752 --> 00:45:11,503
Listen ...

295
00:45:11,628 --> 00:45:15,757
if you're not up to it, I'd understand.
- Hey, I'm your best man.

296
00:45:16,008 --> 00:45:16,884
Come on.

297
00:45:17,009 --> 00:45:17,968
Let's go.

298
00:45:18,552 --> 00:45:22,598
Okay.
- Mrs. Lutz, am I supposed to give Amy an aspirin?

299
00:45:23,223 --> 00:45:25,726
Just give her one before bed, okay?

300
00:45:27,311 --> 00:45:28,604
You gonna be okay?

301
00:45:29,229 --> 00:45:30,647
I don't know.

302
00:45:34,443 --> 00:45:35,444
What's the matter?

303
00:45:36,236 --> 00:45:37,237
The money.

304
00:45:37,821 --> 00:45:39,031
What money?

305
00:45:39,615 --> 00:45:43,118
The money for the caterer. Fifteen hundred dollars!
I put it in ... I put it in this pocket.

306
00:45:43,243 --> 00:45:46,038
Well, it must have fallen out. Come on, now.
- Well, it's not here.

307
00:45:47,581 --> 00:45:49,291
I'll look under here.

308
00:45:51,877 --> 00:45:53,462
Have you checked your pants?

309
00:45:56,965 --> 00:46:00,135
Now calm down, Jimmy. Calm down.
It can't have gotten up and walked away.

310
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:02,012
If you had it here, it's got to be here.

311
00:46:02,137 --> 00:46:03,388
What am I gonna do?

312
00:46:04,598 --> 00:46:07,351
Oh, I can't believe it! I can't believe it!

313
00:46:10,437 --> 00:46:12,731
Will you get those kids off that horn?!

314
00:46:12,856 --> 00:46:14,608
Jimmy ...
George ...

315
00:46:15,067 --> 00:46:17,361
we have to go. We're getting very late.
- George, what am I gonna do?

316
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,033
It's got to be here someplace.

317
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,827
We'll just look for it when we get home.

318
00:46:24,952 --> 00:46:26,411
What about the caterer?

319
00:46:29,498 --> 00:46:30,958
I'll take care of him.

320
00:46:31,124 --> 00:46:32,459
I'll write him a check.

321
00:46:32,751 --> 00:46:34,127
Oh, sweetie.

322
00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:36,088
Okay?

323
00:46:37,214 --> 00:46:38,590
I'll get the kids.

324
00:46:58,443 --> 00:47:00,487
It's freezing in here.

325
00:47:04,283 --> 00:47:05,576
It's time for bed, Amy.

326
00:47:05,701 --> 00:47:11,165
I've got to give you an aspirin.
- I don't wanna go to bed. I wanna play with Jody.

327
00:47:11,290 --> 00:47:14,793
And your mom said Ihad to put you to bed early,
because you've been sick.

328
00:47:14,918 --> 00:47:16,795
Now, don't smart off to me.

329
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,213
I wasn't sick.

330
00:47:18,338 --> 00:47:20,799
I just didn't like meat loaf.

331
00:47:20,924 --> 00:47:22,926
Let's get you into your pajamas.

332
00:47:43,822 --> 00:47:44,907
Amy?

333
00:47:45,073 --> 00:47:46,408
Open the door.

334
00:47:52,039 --> 00:47:53,207
Amy ...

335
00:47:53,665 --> 00:47:56,126
I'm in the closet. Open the door.

336
00:48:00,547 --> 00:48:02,299
Amy, I mean it!

337
00:48:09,139 --> 00:48:10,307
Amy?

338
00:48:10,432 --> 00:48:12,518
Come to the door. Open it!

339
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:18,524
Amy, for christ's sake open the door!

340
00:48:19,233 --> 00:48:20,275
Amy!?

341
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,568
Amy!

342
00:48:27,324 --> 00:48:31,411
Amy! Open the door! Amy!

343
00:48:32,412 --> 00:48:33,288
Open ...

344
00:48:35,666 --> 00:48:38,001
Amy! Open the door!

345
00:48:42,297 --> 00:48:43,632
Amy!

346
00:48:44,091 --> 00:48:46,635
Amy, open the door!

347
00:48:47,886 --> 00:48:49,179
Amy?

348
00:48:49,596 --> 00:48:52,432
For christ's sake open the door!

349
00:48:52,641 --> 00:48:55,686
Amy!

350
00:49:18,125 --> 00:49:19,334
How are you?

351
00:49:20,294 --> 00:49:24,798
Are you feeling better? - Fine. Just fine.
- Good, good. - I want to apologize for the other day.
- Oh,  don't worry about that.

352
00:49:24,923 --> 00:49:30,804
I don't know what happened. I hadn't gone
a half a block from your house and I was violently ill.

353
00:49:30,929 --> 00:49:36,602
I think there's a ... virus or something going around.
- Yeah? - Father Delaney's got something
and Amy's got something and ...

354
00:49:36,852 --> 00:49:39,146
I don't know what's the matter with George.
- Oh.

355
00:49:40,647 --> 00:49:41,732
Listen ...

356
00:49:41,899 --> 00:49:43,692
I'll talk to you later, okay?

357
00:49:56,497 --> 00:49:58,290
I'm gonna write you a check.

358
00:49:59,041 --> 00:50:04,338
Look, the deal was cash, you know? Cash.
- The cash is lost. you gotta take a check.

359
00:50:04,463 --> 00:50:05,881
I don't like checks.

360
00:50:06,006 --> 00:50:08,008
Let me tell you something about checks.

361
00:50:08,133 --> 00:50:11,053
Checks get canceled. Checks bounce.

362
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:13,055
Checks is not cash.

363
00:50:13,305 --> 00:50:15,098
Cash is cash.

364
00:50:15,724 --> 00:50:17,184
Now you listen to me, pal.

365
00:50:17,935 --> 00:50:19,603
I don't like lectures.

366
00:50:19,978 --> 00:50:22,856
And I don't like being hassled in the men's room.

367
00:50:22,981 --> 00:50:24,775
I'm gonna write you a check.

368
00:50:25,734 --> 00:50:29,696
Either that's good enough for you
or either you're eat your own goddamn food.

369
00:50:32,241 --> 00:50:33,575
Look at this.

370
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:36,495
I want cash and they're giving me a checks.

371
00:50:38,539 --> 00:50:39,998
Are you all right, honey?

372
00:50:40,290 --> 00:50:42,376
I said, I got to make it through the reception.

373
00:50:43,418 --> 00:50:47,172
Let's get the kids and split, huh?
- Okay. I'll get the kids, you take it easy.

374
00:51:20,831 --> 00:51:22,332
Matt, get over there.

375
00:51:28,213 --> 00:51:30,883
Now Matt. Right upstairs and right to bed. Come on.
- Why?

376
00:51:31,008 --> 00:51:36,763
Upstairs and right to bed.- I'm not even tired.
- You are so tired. - I am not!
- You're tired, because I said you're tired.

377
00:51:37,181 --> 00:51:38,807
Hey ... cut that out.

378
00:51:39,057 --> 00:51:41,226
Come on. I'll bring you up some milk and cookies.

379
00:51:42,019 --> 00:51:44,104
Let me out.

380
00:51:45,355 --> 00:51:46,607
Let me out.

381
00:51:47,983 --> 00:51:51,653
Let me out.
- Amy? Amy, are you okay?

382
00:51:54,781 --> 00:51:55,741
Jackie?

383
00:51:56,450 --> 00:51:57,910
Oh, my god!

384
00:51:58,035 --> 00:51:59,912
I ... I ... - What happened?
- I couldn't get out.

385
00:52:00,037 --> 00:52:04,500
The ... the door closed and it locked
and I couldn't get out.
- No, there's no lock on this door.

386
00:52:04,625 --> 00:52:05,918
It wouldn't open.

387
00:52:06,043 --> 00:52:07,002
Take a look.

388
00:52:07,127 --> 00:52:08,337
Look. See?

389
00:52:11,423 --> 00:52:13,383
It wouldn't open!

390
00:52:14,176 --> 00:52:17,513
Why didn't you open the door?
Why didn't you answer me?
- Jackie! Jackie!

391
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:19,932
Why didn't you unlock the door?

392
00:52:20,057 --> 00:52:21,433
You heard Jackie knocking.

393
00:52:21,558 --> 00:52:23,477
Jody wouldn't let me.

394
00:52:23,894 --> 00:52:25,437
Jody? Who's Jody?

395
00:52:25,604 --> 00:52:28,732
She's my friend. And she comes to play with me.

396
00:52:29,233 --> 00:52:32,319
Jesus Christ, what the hell
are we standing here listening to?

397
00:52:32,486 --> 00:52:34,571
And weren't you told to go to bed?

398
00:52:35,239 --> 00:52:36,740
Go on!
Get out of here!

399
00:52:39,952 --> 00:52:42,746
These kids of yours need some goddamn discipline.

400
00:52:46,792 --> 00:52:48,836
Ok, let me see.
Let me go get something for them.

401
00:52:48,961 --> 00:52:50,963
George yelled at me.

402
00:52:51,088 --> 00:52:52,923
You should have opened the door!

403
00:52:54,466 --> 00:52:57,219
Jody doesn't like George.

404
00:53:40,888 --> 00:53:44,057
Where the hell is it?!

405
00:53:47,853 --> 00:53:51,148
There's an explanation for all of it.

406
00:53:51,523 --> 00:53:54,193
We're not in the habit of blaming satan
for every phenomenon.

407
00:53:54,318 --> 00:53:55,486
Neither am I, father.

408
00:53:55,611 --> 00:53:56,445
Well ...

409
00:53:56,904 --> 00:53:58,155
for a marianist ...

410
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:00,365
who thought Vatican too didn't go far enough.

411
00:54:00,491 --> 00:54:03,076
Don't you think you sound a little medieval?

412
00:54:06,121 --> 00:54:08,248
My being a marianist has nothing to do with it.

413
00:54:08,874 --> 00:54:14,129
I happened to check into the murders.
And I checked into the 20-year-old boy,
who killed his parents and his four brothers and sisters.

414
00:54:14,254 --> 00:54:15,589
And when he was at trial ...

415
00:54:15,714 --> 00:54:18,342
he testified that he heard voices in the house!
He heard ...

416
00:54:18,467 --> 00:54:21,595
voices in the house.
And the voices told him to do it!

417
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:24,264
Now, I was in the house and I heard the voices too!

418
00:54:24,389 --> 00:54:29,019
And I also felt a presence in the house!
I'm telling you, there was a presence in that house!

419
00:54:29,353 --> 00:54:32,523
Half the killers in this country say the same thing.

420
00:54:32,856 --> 00:54:33,899
"The voices."

421
00:54:34,066 --> 00:54:39,238
"The voices told me to do it."
- But I heard them, father! I heard voices!

422
00:54:39,488 --> 00:54:42,574
Oh, then explain this!
Explain my hand, if you can do that!

423
00:54:42,699 --> 00:54:43,283
Go on!

424
00:54:43,408 --> 00:54:45,786
Explain how the car went out of control!
Go on. Father Bolen was with me. You tell him!

425
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:49,456
Well ...

426
00:54:49,581 --> 00:54:53,168
the wheel locked and then then ...
- "The wheel locked".

427
00:54:54,002 --> 00:54:56,213
How about a mechanical defect?

428
00:54:56,338 --> 00:54:59,132
I'd blame Detroit a lot faster than the devil.

429
00:54:59,633 --> 00:55:02,469
Seems like every month there's some kind of recall.

430
00:55:07,015 --> 00:55:08,141
I see ...

431
00:55:09,977 --> 00:55:11,770
We're just gonna walk away from it.

432
00:55:12,771 --> 00:55:15,232
Well, has that become the fashion now, to cover up?

433
00:55:15,524 --> 00:55:17,192
Nothing to walk away from.

434
00:55:18,402 --> 00:55:20,028
Well, I think it's nonsense.

435
00:55:20,154 --> 00:55:24,074
There's nothing to cover up.
- I think it's bureaucratical bullshit!

436
00:55:25,492 --> 00:55:26,952
What do you think I am?!

437
00:55:29,204 --> 00:55:30,789
I am not some ...

438
00:55:30,914 --> 00:55:33,292
pink ...
cheeked seminarian ...

439
00:55:33,417 --> 00:55:36,044
who doesn't know the difference
between the supernatural ...

440
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:41,049
and a bad clam! I am a trained psychotherapist!
I went into that house!

441
00:55:41,175 --> 00:55:42,885
And what I saw there was real!


442
00:55:43,010 --> 00:55:47,347
What I felt there was real!
And what I heard there WAS REAL!

443
00:55:47,514 --> 00:55:51,935
Now, gentlemen, I have a family
in my parish that's at great risk!

444
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:54,188
They are facing real danger.

445
00:55:56,190 --> 00:55:59,526
Who the hell do you think you are?!

446
00:55:59,651 --> 00:56:04,281
You think your secular education
gives you the right to question the church?!

447
00:56:05,532 --> 00:56:06,783
Sit down!!

448
00:56:08,785 --> 00:56:09,912
Sit!

449
00:56:22,716 --> 00:56:28,347
Now, you haven't told us one thing
that can't be written off as simple hysteria.

450
00:56:29,389 --> 00:56:33,977
Even psychotherapists lose touch with reality sometimes.

451
00:56:34,728 --> 00:56:37,648
Your education doesn't give you any immunity.

452
00:56:40,567 --> 00:56:43,779
Father Nuncio and I have seen our share of phenomena,

453
00:56:43,904 --> 00:56:48,325
And never once did any of them turn out to be satanist!

454
00:56:53,163 --> 00:56:55,833
Let's understand each other, father.

455
00:56:58,961 --> 00:57:00,212
to me ...

456
00:57:01,046 --> 00:57:02,422
The church ...

457
00:57:03,423 --> 00:57:05,425
it's my home.

458
00:57:06,009 --> 00:57:07,052
The church ...

459
00:57:07,594 --> 00:57:10,138
is my strength.

460
00:57:17,312 --> 00:57:19,356
And I need her now.

461
00:57:20,107 --> 00:57:21,483
And that family ...

462
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:23,527
needs her ...

463
00:57:24,236 --> 00:57:25,654
now.

464
00:57:31,535 --> 00:57:32,578
Frank? ...

465
00:57:33,412 --> 00:57:36,623
How long has it been since you've seen your family?

466
00:57:41,670 --> 00:57:42,671
What do you mean?

467
00:57:43,338 --> 00:57:45,841
We think you should take a vacation.

468
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:51,597
Good morning, father.

469
00:57:53,182 --> 00:57:54,349
Good day, father.

470
00:57:55,851 --> 00:57:57,895
You could do a haircut and shave.

471
00:58:40,103 --> 00:58:42,105
What do you think?
- Very uptown.

472
00:58:42,231 --> 00:58:43,774
I thought you guys had a small business.

473
00:58:43,899 --> 00:58:46,985
Believe me, we do. Getting smaller all the time.

474
00:58:48,821 --> 00:58:49,780
What's the matter?

475
00:58:53,909 --> 00:58:55,619
I don't want to go any closer.

476
00:58:56,411 --> 00:58:57,371
Carolyn ...

477
00:58:57,913 --> 00:58:59,289
What are you talking about?

478
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:03,168
It gives me the creeps.

479
00:59:25,023 --> 00:59:26,233
Hiya, George.

480
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:27,568
How's it going?

481
00:59:31,321 --> 00:59:32,531
Listen, I ...

482
00:59:33,198 --> 00:59:36,618
I wouldn't have come out and bothered you,
but your line's always busy.

483
00:59:36,743 --> 00:59:38,453
Nobody's seen you for days.

484
00:59:40,664 --> 00:59:43,333
You haven't even been in to sign the payroll checks.

485
00:59:44,418 --> 00:59:46,670
I did us both a favor and brought them along.

486
00:59:46,962 --> 00:59:47,796
Here.

487
00:59:48,463 --> 00:59:49,840
Guess what day is this.

488
00:59:49,965 --> 00:59:51,133
Thursday.

489
00:59:53,135 --> 00:59:54,511
Thursday?

490
00:59:56,346 --> 00:59:57,347
Thursday.

491
00:59:59,558 --> 01:00:02,478
I promised the men I'd hand deliver these.

492
01:00:02,978 --> 01:00:04,730
Should have been paid yesterday.

493
01:00:07,608 --> 01:00:11,445
Some caterer's been screaming.
You wrote him a personal check that bounced?

494
01:00:14,323 --> 01:00:18,076
I should have covered that.
- And some guy from the IRS has been calling.

495
01:00:18,202 --> 01:00:20,204
Don't you have any good news?

496
01:00:24,833 --> 01:00:26,293
Yeah, I ...

497
01:00:27,544 --> 01:00:29,796
I brought you the spotlight for your boat.

498
01:00:36,178 --> 01:00:36,970
Come on.

499
01:00:37,095 --> 01:00:38,639
I'll put it on for you.

500
01:00:41,892 --> 01:00:42,768
Come on.

501
01:00:58,408 --> 01:01:01,119
You girls think I don't know what you're up to?

502
01:01:01,245 --> 01:01:03,372
Well ... I do.

503
01:01:03,580 --> 01:01:08,585
If I ever catch you again, you're gonna be
in big trouble.

504
01:01:08,836 --> 01:01:10,212
You girls hear me?
janet,

505
01:01:10,462 --> 01:01:11,380
Janet?

506
01:01:11,505 --> 01:01:12,923
Are you listening?

507
01:01:13,131 --> 01:01:15,634
Now, don't be a smart-ass.

508
01:01:20,013 --> 01:01:22,808
You quit that.
Stop teasing me.

509
01:01:25,519 --> 01:01:26,395
Hey ...

510
01:01:27,062 --> 01:01:29,606
what are you two rascals doing in my room, huh?

511
01:01:38,157 --> 01:01:39,950
Oh, my god! Stucked!

512
01:01:47,958 --> 01:01:50,586
the goddamn thing
feels like it's nailed shut!

513
01:01:52,838 --> 01:01:53,630
Push!

514
01:02:22,242 --> 01:02:24,119
Hold it up. Don't ... don't let it drop.

515
01:02:24,244 --> 01:02:25,787
I'll drive, honey.

516
01:02:25,954 --> 01:02:27,664
Amazing.
- What?

517
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:29,750
Not one broken bone.

518
01:02:40,636 --> 01:02:42,179
george, are you awake?

519
01:02:46,892 --> 01:02:50,604
Isn't it kind of strange none of the bones
were broken in Greg's hand?

520
01:02:55,192 --> 01:02:57,486
George, I have to talk to you.

521
01:05:20,379 --> 01:05:23,757
What was that?
- I don't know. you stay up here. - Like hell.

522
01:05:32,641 --> 01:05:33,517
Wait.

523
01:05:33,767 --> 01:05:34,685
Wait.

524
01:05:47,364 --> 01:05:49,408
Goddamnit, don't sneak up on me!

525
01:05:51,326 --> 01:05:53,912
You call the police. I'm gonna go check on something.

526
01:05:54,163 --> 01:05:55,706
It's okay, sweetie.

527
01:06:53,472 --> 01:06:55,474
Hi, sarge. What brings you out?

528
01:06:55,599 --> 01:06:57,017
Insomnia.

529
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:06,360
What do you got?

530
01:07:06,735 --> 01:07:08,320
Beats the hell out of me?

531
01:07:27,005 --> 01:07:28,048
What do you got?

532
01:07:28,340 --> 01:07:30,968
This is Mrs. Lutz, sergeant.
- Mrs. Lutz.

533
01:07:32,427 --> 01:07:34,596
And a ... George Lutz.

534
01:07:42,813 --> 01:07:44,773
Is that l-u-t-z?

535
01:07:45,065 --> 01:07:48,277
No "e."
- The basement door is the same as the front.

536
01:07:50,904 --> 01:07:52,322
Well, where's the basement?

537
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:53,949
Come on, I'll show you.

538
01:08:16,555 --> 01:08:18,307
Hey, who let you in?

539
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:21,185
What are you doing there, boy?

540
01:08:26,940 --> 01:08:28,484
No broken windows.

541
01:08:31,820 --> 01:08:33,363
How long you been living here?

542
01:08:34,031 --> 01:08:35,449
A couple of weeks.

543
01:08:37,284 --> 01:08:39,995
Are you related to the family that was here before?

544
01:08:43,790 --> 01:08:46,960
You look a lot like them. The kid had the same ...

545
01:08:47,586 --> 01:08:49,213
Harry, knock it off!

546
01:08:59,181 --> 01:09:02,434
Have you had any trouble with vandals or trespassers?

547
01:09:02,559 --> 01:09:04,394
What's that supposed to mean?

548
01:09:04,645 --> 01:09:05,479
Well ...

549
01:09:06,730 --> 01:09:10,651
You've got a door that was broken
outward, Mr. Lutz from the inside.

550
01:09:12,194 --> 01:09:13,695
Burglars break in.

551
01:09:13,821 --> 01:09:15,989
You've got a front door, that's broken out.

552
01:09:16,907 --> 01:09:18,367
Let me tell you something.

553
01:09:18,951 --> 01:09:21,537
Somebody broke into my house.
They heard me coming ...

554
01:09:21,662 --> 01:09:23,288
and they took off.

555
01:09:24,122 --> 01:09:26,583
Okay. Then who broke the basement door?

556
01:09:27,209 --> 01:09:29,670
Oh, maybe they came in through the cellar and ...

557
01:09:30,420 --> 01:09:32,381
and ran out the front door.

558
01:09:32,506 --> 01:09:35,050
No. I checked all the windows down there. None broken.

559
01:09:35,175 --> 01:09:38,220
You think it was faster to break it down
than to open it? Huh?

560
01:09:46,395 --> 01:09:48,355
There'll be a tighter watch on your house.

561
01:09:49,356 --> 01:09:51,692
And you call us if anything happens, okay?

562
01:09:53,485 --> 01:09:54,403
Good night.

563
01:09:55,279 --> 01:09:56,280
Good night.

564
01:09:56,905 --> 01:09:57,865
Night.

565
01:10:57,174 --> 01:10:58,926
Why's all going wrong?

566
01:11:01,094 --> 01:11:03,055
we have to do something.

567
01:11:27,287 --> 01:11:29,998
Jody says everything's gonna get better.

568
01:11:30,624 --> 01:11:32,459
What does Jody look like, huh?

569
01:11:33,544 --> 01:11:34,878
I mean, uh ...

570
01:11:35,003 --> 01:11:36,380
Is Jody ...

571
01:11:36,505 --> 01:11:39,341
big girl or thin or fat?

572
01:11:39,716 --> 01:11:41,552
She's nice.

573
01:11:43,011 --> 01:11:47,141
She tells me things too.
- Yeah? Like what does she tell you?

574
01:11:47,266 --> 01:11:50,811
She tells me about the little boy,
who used to live in my room.

575
01:11:50,936 --> 01:11:52,062
He got hurt ...

576
01:11:52,187 --> 01:11:53,856
and he died.

577
01:11:55,023 --> 01:11:56,859
And what else does Jody tell you?

578
01:11:56,984 --> 01:12:00,320
She says she wants me to live here forever and ever.

579
01:12:00,445 --> 01:12:02,739
So we can all play together.

580
01:12:25,137 --> 01:12:26,263
Goodbye, sweeties.

581
01:12:26,513 --> 01:12:28,557
Be home by 3:30, okay?

582
01:12:29,683 --> 01:12:31,143
Be careful.

583
01:13:46,176 --> 01:13:47,845
Oh, answer.

584
01:13:58,313 --> 01:14:00,190
Please, answer.

585
01:14:16,290 --> 01:14:17,332
Hello.

586
01:14:17,457 --> 01:14:19,251
Father, this is Kathy Lutz ...

587
01:14:19,793 --> 01:14:21,879
and I have to talk to you.

588
01:14:22,337 --> 01:14:23,505
Kathy ...

589
01:14:24,965 --> 01:14:26,717
listen to what I'm telling you.

590
01:14:27,968 --> 01:14:29,219
Father?

591
01:14:30,179 --> 01:14:31,638
Father!

592
01:14:35,267 --> 01:14:36,685
Father!

593
01:14:50,491 --> 01:14:52,409
O, lord, hear my prayer ...

594
01:14:53,535 --> 01:14:55,621
and hasten to answer me.

595
01:15:38,705 --> 01:15:39,665
Hello.

596
01:15:40,541 --> 01:15:44,002
Everybody wanted to come over though.
To welcome you to the neighborhood.

597
01:15:46,463 --> 01:15:47,840
It's all right, isn't it?

598
01:15:52,010 --> 01:15:53,762
Just a minute, please.

599
01:15:57,307 --> 01:15:58,183
Hello.

600
01:15:59,768 --> 01:16:00,769
Hello?!

601
01:16:50,152 --> 01:16:51,195
George ...

602
01:16:52,654 --> 01:16:53,739
Thanks for coming.

603
01:16:54,448 --> 01:16:56,074
I thought I might be stood up.

604
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:59,870
Look, don't give me any crap.
I don't have time for it. - George ...

605
01:17:00,245 --> 01:17:02,664
Relax, will you? I just want to buy you a drink.

606
01:17:02,789 --> 01:17:05,209
A couple of beers, please?
- Gotcha.

607
01:17:09,463 --> 01:17:10,506
George?

608
01:17:11,381 --> 01:17:12,591
Are you all right?

609
01:17:12,716 --> 01:17:13,884
I mean, you look terrible.

610
01:17:14,009 --> 01:17:15,427
Here you are, pal.

611
01:17:16,970 --> 01:17:18,764
Jesus, I'm sorry.

612
01:17:19,014 --> 01:17:20,974
You look just like that kid.

613
01:17:21,099 --> 01:17:23,811
You know, he was sitting right in that seat
where you are when he was arrested.

614
01:17:23,936 --> 01:17:25,521
What the hell
are you talking about?

615
01:17:26,104 --> 01:17:29,817
The kid last year that killed his family.
You know the house down by the river.

616
01:17:30,025 --> 01:17:30,442
Hey ...

617
01:17:30,609 --> 01:17:32,027
You're the spitting image.
so?

618
01:17:32,194 --> 01:17:33,237
So?

619
01:17:33,529 --> 01:17:34,363
So, I'll ...

620
01:17:34,488 --> 01:17:35,823
bring you another brew.

621
01:17:36,281 --> 01:17:37,825
No offense, huh?

622
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:43,413
Look, I gotta get out of here. I'll talk to you later.
- No, George now.

623
01:17:43,539 --> 01:17:44,790
We gotta talk now.

624
01:17:44,915 --> 01:17:48,418
The business is falling apart. People are calling.
Bills have to be paid.

625
01:17:48,544 --> 01:17:53,340
I know you're busy unpacking, but life goes on.
- Don't push me, Jeff. I'm warning you.
I don't have the patience.

626
01:17:53,465 --> 01:17:54,466
You're warning me.

627
01:17:54,591 --> 01:17:56,593
Give me a break, wiil you? Talk to me!

628
01:18:00,514 --> 01:18:03,517
I knew this would happen.
I told you, you were taking on too much.

629
01:18:03,684 --> 01:18:08,897
Just drop it, Jeff!
- You marry a dame with three kids.
You buy a big house with mortgages up to your ass.

630
01:18:09,022 --> 01:18:13,068
You change your religion
and you forget about business, great. Really great.

631
01:18:20,409 --> 01:18:21,493
Okay.

632
01:18:22,411 --> 01:18:23,871
Now can we talk?

633
01:18:26,790 --> 01:18:28,292
Christ, man, I'm sorry.

634
01:18:28,584 --> 01:18:30,627
I don't know what I was thinking, huh?

635
01:18:30,961 --> 01:18:32,171
Okay.

636
01:18:32,546 --> 01:18:33,463
All right.

637
01:18:34,381 --> 01:18:38,844
* Jesus loves me, this I know *

638
01:18:38,969 --> 01:18:43,474
* For the bible tells me so *

639
01:18:43,599 --> 01:18:48,270
* Little ones to him belong *

640
01:18:48,395 --> 01:18:53,817
* They are weak, but he is strong *

641
01:18:53,942 --> 01:18:57,905
* Yes ...
Jesus loves me *

642
01:18:58,071 --> 01:19:02,075
* Yes ... 
Jesus loves me *

643
01:19:02,201 --> 01:19:06,038
* Yes ... 
 Jesus loves me *

644
01:19:06,163 --> 01:19:08,749
* The bible *

645
01:19:10,250 --> 01:19:12,002
Who you singing to, princess?

646
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:14,046
You scared Jody.

647
01:19:14,963 --> 01:19:16,048
Jody?

648
01:19:17,841 --> 01:19:19,343
Look, there's no one here.  You see?

649
01:19:19,468 --> 01:19:20,928
You scared her.

650
01:19:21,053 --> 01:19:23,180
She went out the window.

651
01:19:23,847 --> 01:19:25,516
She went out the window?

652
01:19:25,641 --> 01:19:29,269
Well, I ... I better check and make sure
she's not still there, huh?

653
01:19:41,698 --> 01:19:42,533
The house ...

654
01:19:42,658 --> 01:19:44,243
is doing things.

655
01:19:44,618 --> 01:19:46,995
Windows open by themselves.

656
01:19:47,955 --> 01:19:50,624
Rooms full of flies at the wrong time of year.

657
01:19:50,749 --> 01:19:52,876
You saw what happened to Greg's hand.

658
01:19:53,794 --> 01:19:55,212
It's crazy.

659
01:19:55,754 --> 01:19:57,172
And a ...

660
01:19:57,297 --> 01:20:00,342
last night the front door was ripped off its hinges.

661
01:20:00,467 --> 01:20:02,094
From the inside.

662
01:20:03,178 --> 01:20:04,346
Of course.

663
01:20:04,471 --> 01:20:06,640
It's right here; its history.

664
01:20:07,099 --> 01:20:08,767
John Ketchum.

665
01:20:08,976 --> 01:20:09,852
So?

666
01:20:10,060 --> 01:20:11,061
Listen ...

667
01:20:11,186 --> 01:20:14,189
They ran him out of Salem for being a witch.

668
01:20:16,275 --> 01:20:18,652
And he built his house exactly where you're living.

669
01:20:20,487 --> 01:20:23,198
You're living on some sort of special ground.

670
01:20:24,575 --> 01:20:26,201
Devil worship.

671
01:20:26,618 --> 01:20:27,661
Death.

672
01:20:28,829 --> 01:20:30,455
Sacrifice.

673
01:20:31,748 --> 01:20:33,125
George ...

674
01:20:34,126 --> 01:20:36,003
there's one simple rule.

675
01:20:36,670 --> 01:20:40,507
Energy cannot be created or destroyed.
It can only change forms.

676
01:20:40,632 --> 01:20:45,012
Carolyne, will you get a grip on yourself?
You sound like some kind of psycho weirdo.

677
01:20:45,137 --> 01:20:46,972
Come on, Jeffrey.

678
01:20:47,222 --> 01:20:49,725
Don't be such a big hard-core rationalist.

679
01:20:49,850 --> 01:20:52,644
You know, everything in life
cannot be explained by a slide rule.

680
01:20:52,769 --> 01:20:56,148
Oh, thank you very much for your cosmic views.
Now do me a favor.

681
01:20:56,273 --> 01:20:57,399
Shut up!

682
01:21:03,113 --> 01:21:04,823
Can I make a rational suggestion?

683
01:21:04,948 --> 01:21:05,991
Please?

684
01:21:08,619 --> 01:21:09,745
Sure, man.

685
01:21:10,454 --> 01:21:11,788
Anything.

686
01:21:13,665 --> 01:21:14,750
Go home ...

687
01:21:15,042 --> 01:21:16,502
Get cleaned up.

688
01:21:16,627 --> 01:21:18,879
Take Kathy out to dinner.

689
01:21:19,087 --> 01:21:21,381
Carolyn and I will baby-sit the kids.

690
01:21:22,174 --> 01:21:26,637
You've got to get away from it, George.
Even if it's for a couple of hours.
And when you get back ...

691
01:21:27,513 --> 01:21:29,056
We'll add it all up.

692
01:21:29,473 --> 01:21:31,308
We'll talk this thing through.

693
01:21:38,065 --> 01:21:39,149
Okay.

694
01:21:40,609 --> 01:21:42,027
Let's go home.

695
01:21:56,500 --> 01:22:00,963
Look, I'll go in and talk to Kathy
and you all come in a couple of minutes.

696
01:22:07,761 --> 01:22:08,637
Hey ...

697
01:22:08,887 --> 01:22:09,721
Hey.

698
01:22:09,972 --> 01:22:10,848
Hey!

699
01:22:12,349 --> 01:22:14,101
He told us to wait out here.

700
01:22:14,726 --> 01:22:15,769
Jeff ...

701
01:22:17,354 --> 01:22:19,022
I've got to see it for myself.

702
01:22:19,148 --> 01:22:22,276
I thought that place give you the creeps.
- What?

703
01:22:26,155 --> 01:22:28,282
Are those vibes ever strong.

704
01:22:29,867 --> 01:22:31,577
It really pulls on you.

705
01:22:33,745 --> 01:22:36,540
I've got to see the basement.
That's where it's coming from.

706
01:22:37,291 --> 01:22:40,002
I'm very sensitive about these things.

707
01:22:41,336 --> 01:22:43,046
And I know about them.

708
01:22:47,092 --> 01:22:49,052
Come on. Knock it off, will you?

709
01:22:51,680 --> 01:22:54,349
What I saw was not a cat!

710
01:22:57,186 --> 01:23:01,356
It could have climbed up the ivy.
I mean, it's all over the side of the damned house.

711
01:23:04,234 --> 01:23:06,820
Look, Kathy. I don't have all the answers yet.

712
01:23:07,529 --> 01:23:09,907
We've got to get some perspective on this thing.

713
01:23:12,576 --> 01:23:13,535
Come on.

714
01:23:13,702 --> 01:23:15,329
Let's take Jeff's offer.

715
01:23:15,746 --> 01:23:17,372
Put yourself together.

716
01:23:17,998 --> 01:23:20,667
Let's get the hell away from it for a couple hours.

717
01:23:22,127 --> 01:23:23,712
Well, get dressed.

718
01:23:25,589 --> 01:23:27,424
I just gotta check the fire first.

719
01:23:38,227 --> 01:23:40,020
Demons are smart.

720
01:23:40,437 --> 01:23:42,564
They're not just monsters.
They ...

721
01:23:44,691 --> 01:23:46,068
They think.

722
01:23:46,318 --> 01:23:48,111
Just like you and I do.

723
01:23:48,529 --> 01:23:50,405
Just in reverse. You know.

724
01:23:50,614 --> 01:23:52,324
It's a closed system.

725
01:23:54,034 --> 01:23:56,119
Now you're beginning to give me the creeps.

726
01:23:59,540 --> 01:24:02,751
There was a tribe of indians called the Shinnecocks.

727
01:24:02,876 --> 01:24:06,713
And they used this land as a sort of ...
exposure pen.

728
01:24:09,842 --> 01:24:11,385
They put all the crazy people, here.

729
01:24:11,510 --> 01:24:13,220
And they left them here to die.

730
01:24:16,140 --> 01:24:17,307
My god.

731
01:24:17,808 --> 01:24:20,435
That's where it is.
- What the hell are you talking about?

732
01:24:22,896 --> 01:24:24,982
There are people buried here.

733
01:24:30,571 --> 01:24:31,864
Easy.

734
01:24:32,239 --> 01:24:33,657
Easy.

735
01:24:34,199 --> 01:24:36,201
Easy, Harry.

736
01:24:53,218 --> 01:24:54,761
What the hell are you doing?!

737
01:24:57,014 --> 01:24:58,390
what is the matter with you?!

738
01:24:58,515 --> 01:25:00,100
Don't you understand?

739
01:25:00,225 --> 01:25:05,856
It has to be done. That is where the room is!
- What the hell are you doing to my house?!
- George, I'm sorry. I don't know what got into her.

740
01:25:05,981 --> 01:25:07,149
I'm trying to tell him.

741
01:25:07,274 --> 01:25:08,942
That's where it is.

742
01:25:20,996 --> 01:25:22,206
She's right.

743
01:25:23,665 --> 01:25:25,709
She's right.
There is something here.

744
01:25:29,838 --> 01:25:30,714
Give me that.

745
01:25:56,031 --> 01:25:57,574
What's going on?

746
01:25:58,492 --> 01:26:01,453
Have you all gone mad?
George!

747
01:26:24,977 --> 01:26:25,853
They ...

748
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:28,647
come and go through here.

749
01:26:40,993 --> 01:26:43,203
Find the well.

750
01:26:45,289 --> 01:26:48,083
It's ... the passage ...

751
01:26:48,333 --> 01:26:49,835
to hell!

752
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:57,176
Cover it!!!

753
01:27:40,385 --> 01:27:41,470
Hello?

754
01:27:59,446 --> 01:28:01,949
George, you heard that voice?

755
01:28:02,449 --> 01:28:05,160
You know whose voice that was?

756
01:28:06,745 --> 01:28:09,289
You heard it! I know you heard it!

757
01:28:15,379 --> 01:28:18,590
We have to do something, George.
We ...

758
01:28:18,715 --> 01:28:21,135
We have to do something now.

759
01:29:05,721 --> 01:29:08,265
Peace to this house and all who enter here.

760
01:29:08,390 --> 01:29:12,227
Forgive our sins ...
- Peace to this house and all who enter here.
- ...and save us from all illness.

761
01:29:12,811 --> 01:29:15,606
Grant this
through Jesus Christ, our lord.

762
01:29:24,573 --> 01:29:26,116
What's going on?

763
01:29:30,829 --> 01:29:32,331
weird people.

764
01:29:48,639 --> 01:29:50,974
Bless this house and all who enter here.

765
01:29:51,183 --> 01:29:52,684
Bless this house ...

766
01:29:54,478 --> 01:29:55,020
What?

767
01:29:55,145 --> 01:29:56,438
What's happening?

768
01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:04,404
Kathy?

769
01:30:04,696 --> 01:30:05,656
Kathy?

770
01:30:08,867 --> 01:30:11,328
Kathy?
- No! Don't touch me!

771
01:30:11,495 --> 01:30:14,206
Leave me alone, please.

772
01:30:17,543 --> 01:30:18,961
please?

773
01:30:34,935 --> 01:30:37,104
Father, since i've come back from Vietnam,

774
01:30:37,229 --> 01:30:40,065
you've got a tremendous influence in my life. I ...

775
01:30:40,983 --> 01:30:43,902
I look up to you, I respect you, I admire you.

776
01:30:44,027 --> 01:30:45,529
And what is your point?!

777
01:30:47,573 --> 01:30:49,616
Well, I believe that ...

778
01:30:50,367 --> 01:30:53,203
That I know about fear. I've seen it. I ...

779
01:30:53,871 --> 01:30:55,372
experienced it.

780
01:30:57,374 --> 01:31:00,502
Richard, I wish you'd make your point,
because I've got a lot of things to do.

781
01:31:01,128 --> 01:31:05,340
My point is, father, that I believe we create
our own demons in our own minds.

782
01:31:09,595 --> 01:31:11,054
I'm sorry, father.

783
01:31:33,911 --> 01:31:35,913
In the name of the father, the son ...

784
01:31:36,330 --> 01:31:37,915
and the holy spirit.

785
01:31:44,588 --> 01:31:45,923
Let us pray.

786
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:00,437
Father ...

787
01:32:03,398 --> 01:32:05,234
by the power of your spirit ...

788
01:32:06,485 --> 01:32:08,362
you have filled the hearts ...

789
01:32:09,905 --> 01:32:11,698
of your faithful people.

790
01:32:13,242 --> 01:32:14,910
With gifts of love ...

791
01:32:16,203 --> 01:32:17,746
for one another.

792
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:23,794
Hear the prayers that we offer
for our relatives and friends.

793
01:32:25,045 --> 01:32:26,672
Give them health.

794
01:32:28,006 --> 01:32:30,592
Give them health of mind and body ...

795
01:32:30,884 --> 01:32:31,969
that ...

796
01:32:35,889 --> 01:32:40,102
Give them health of mind and body
that they may do your will with perfect love.

797
01:32:43,063 --> 01:32:44,773
Give them health of mind and body ...

798
01:32:45,399 --> 01:32:48,068
that they may do your will with perfect love!

799
01:32:48,193 --> 01:32:49,236
We ask this ...

800
01:32:49,361 --> 01:32:52,239
through our lord, Jesus Christ, your son!

801
01:32:53,615 --> 01:32:56,201
Give them strength of mind and body!

802
01:32:56,326 --> 01:33:00,497
O lord,
I beg thee!

803
01:33:00,622 --> 01:33:03,542
Give them strength in the name of our lord ...

804
01:33:03,667 --> 01:33:08,464
Jesus Christ, your son!
O lord!

805
01:33:09,590 --> 01:33:12,801
Oh, Jesus Christ!

806
01:33:25,731 --> 01:33:26,565
Richard.

807
01:33:30,277 --> 01:33:31,653
what is it,
father?

808
01:33:35,032 --> 01:33:36,825
I can't see.

809
01:33:43,624 --> 01:33:45,459
I'm blind.

810
01:35:06,832 --> 01:35:08,542
What do you want from us?

811
01:35:12,337 --> 01:35:15,007
Goddamn it, this is my house!

812
01:36:12,105 --> 01:36:13,357
No!

813
01:36:13,941 --> 01:36:18,028
No, no, no! No!

814
01:36:59,653 --> 01:37:00,487
Oh, no.

815
01:37:02,489 --> 01:37:04,032
Oh, no.

816
01:37:05,325 --> 01:37:07,119
I'm coming apart!

817
01:37:07,244 --> 01:37:11,081
Oh, mother of god, I'm coming apart!

818
01:37:15,419 --> 01:37:16,670
George?

819
01:37:18,005 --> 01:37:20,299
George? What hap ...

820
01:37:21,675 --> 01:37:22,801
I was ...

821
01:37:22,926 --> 01:37:24,344
just dreaming.

822
01:37:24,845 --> 01:37:26,680
I'm sorry, if I woke you.

823
01:37:26,889 --> 01:37:27,973
Honey ...

824
01:37:28,140 --> 01:37:29,725
are you okay?

825
01:37:29,892 --> 01:37:31,018
Oh, sure.

826
01:37:31,143 --> 01:37:32,644
Are you sure?

827
01:37:38,317 --> 01:37:39,776
Oh, my god.

828
01:37:39,902 --> 01:37:41,403
What happened to your foot?

829
01:37:44,031 --> 01:37:45,240
Oh, look.

830
01:37:46,408 --> 01:37:47,451
Nothing.

831
01:37:47,993 --> 01:37:49,536
I just tripped.

832
01:37:52,915 --> 01:37:56,418
Looks like teeth marks.
- Will you stop nagging at me?

833
01:37:57,544 --> 01:37:59,838
it's always so cold in here.

834
01:38:03,467 --> 01:38:05,260
Let's get out of here, huh?

835
01:38:05,385 --> 01:38:07,930
let's just pack up our stuff and go.

836
01:38:10,933 --> 01:38:14,311
Would you please leave
that damn fire alone and listen to me?!

837
01:38:14,436 --> 01:38:15,979
I'm not going anywhere.

838
01:38:16,104 --> 01:38:19,608
You're the one that wanted a house!
This is it, so just shut up!

839
01:38:20,317 --> 01:38:22,861
You ... bastard.

840
01:38:47,636 --> 01:38:48,720
Let's go.

841
01:38:58,313 --> 01:39:01,150
Excuse me. somebody told me,
you could tell me where a ...

842
01:39:01,275 --> 01:39:02,317
Excuse me?

843
01:39:03,652 --> 01:39:05,404
Someone told me that you ...
- Hello.

844
01:39:05,529 --> 01:39:07,447
I ... I'm sorry. I'm Kathy Lutz and ...

845
01:39:07,573 --> 01:39:09,741
I'm looking for father Delaney.
- Oh.

846
01:39:11,201 --> 01:39:13,036
Hi, I'm father Bolen.

847
01:39:13,996 --> 01:39:17,875
I believe father has gone on his vacation.
He's been very overworked and a ...

848
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:21,712
I must speak to father Delaney.
I simply must.

849
01:39:23,547 --> 01:39:26,717
Y- y-you don't understand.
He's more than a priest to me. He's ...

850
01:39:27,843 --> 01:39:29,303
He's like a friend of mine. He's ...

851
01:39:29,428 --> 01:39:33,974
helped me through some very difficult times in my life.
And i have to talk to him now!

852
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:38,687
It's ... it's out of my hands.

853
01:41:06,650 --> 01:41:07,985
hello, father.

854
01:41:10,154 --> 01:41:11,822
How are you feeling today?

855
01:41:22,791 --> 01:41:25,461
I brought you some mail.
Would you like me to read it?

856
01:41:32,301 --> 01:41:34,761
I noticed there's one here from a former patient.

857
01:41:35,262 --> 01:41:36,388
Would you like to hear it?

858
01:41:47,149 --> 01:41:48,901
It certainly is beautiful here.

859
01:41:53,071 --> 01:41:55,991
Why don't I arrange?
So we can have our lunch here.

860
01:41:56,241 --> 01:41:57,618
Would you like that, father?

861
01:42:37,074 --> 01:42:38,617
Excuse me, father.

862
01:42:39,034 --> 01:42:40,661
Can I have a word with you?

863
01:42:42,079 --> 01:42:43,789
Of course, sergeant. Uh ...

864
01:42:44,206 --> 01:42:45,499
What can I do for you?

865
01:42:45,666 --> 01:42:46,792
Well ...

866
01:42:47,793 --> 01:42:49,795
I don't really know exactly.

867
01:42:49,920 --> 01:42:53,465
You know. It may be just a wild goose chase,
but I'm the curious type.

868
01:42:53,799 --> 01:42:56,218
Like the man says:
"It goes with the territory".

869
01:42:56,593 --> 01:42:58,929
Sergeant, I have a great deal of work to do. Could you ...

870
01:42:59,054 --> 01:43:00,347
make your point, please?

871
01:43:00,472 --> 01:43:03,225
I'd like to know what's happening to father Delaney.

872
01:43:03,892 --> 01:43:06,687
You see, he's an old friend. And I can't get the story right.

873
01:43:06,812 --> 01:43:09,148
Oh, there's no story to get right.

874
01:43:11,733 --> 01:43:14,069
Maybe I am just chasing shadows.

875
01:43:14,695 --> 01:43:16,363
If you could excuse me, please.

876
01:43:48,687 --> 01:43:50,772
I think this has all the good stuff.

877
01:43:51,064 --> 01:43:52,983
I mean, the major coverage.

878
01:43:53,108 --> 01:43:57,196
If there's anything else you need, you wanna see.
I'll go back there and get it.
- No, I think this should be fine.

879
01:43:57,321 --> 01:44:01,700
Hey, that's what I thought. This is the november 14 issue.
That's the day after the murders.

880
01:44:01,825 --> 01:44:02,993
Now, that crank over there.

881
01:44:03,118 --> 01:44:06,747
You turn that crank
- That one there? - Right there.
- Okay. - It advances the film. - Fine.

882
01:44:06,872 --> 01:44:08,749
Each frame is a whole page.

883
01:44:08,874 --> 01:44:11,668
And to get it in focus, you just turn this knob right here.

884
01:44:11,794 --> 01:44:12,961
Okay, i've got it. i'm fine,
i'm fine. you all set? good.

885
01:44:13,086 --> 01:44:15,339
Okay? You all set now?
- I'm fine, I'm fine. - Good.

886
01:44:41,323 --> 01:44:42,366
My god.

887
01:44:42,574 --> 01:44:43,826
George.

888
01:46:50,953 --> 01:46:52,454
George!

889
01:46:52,871 --> 01:46:54,164
George!

890
01:46:58,001 --> 01:46:59,002
Matt!

891
01:46:59,128 --> 01:47:00,462
Greg!

892
01:47:00,963 --> 01:47:02,506
Matt!

893
01:48:00,647 --> 01:48:02,232
Amy!

894
01:48:05,861 --> 01:48:07,029
Amy.

895
01:48:12,951 --> 01:48:14,411
Amy!

896
01:48:36,016 --> 01:48:37,142
Amy?

897
01:48:40,020 --> 01:48:40,896
Amy.

898
01:48:41,313 --> 01:48:42,731
Amy!

899
01:49:03,710 --> 01:49:06,088
Don't hurt my babies.

900
01:49:06,213 --> 01:49:07,339
Kathy?

901
01:49:18,392 --> 01:49:21,145
I ... I saw your picture in the newspaper.

902
01:49:26,692 --> 01:49:28,735
Kathy, I wouldn't hurt you.

903
01:50:03,061 --> 01:50:03,562
Get going!

904
01:50:03,687 --> 01:50:05,189
Now! Get going!

905
01:50:11,445 --> 01:50:12,613
Go ahead!
 hold on!

906
01:50:12,946 --> 01:50:14,490
Hold on. Hold ..

907
01:50:22,039 --> 01:50:23,665
Go! Run!

908
01:50:39,890 --> 01:50:47,022
Get out! Open it! - I got it!
- Something's coming. Please, open it!

909
01:50:47,898 --> 01:50:49,650
go, go, go!

910
01:50:49,775 --> 01:50:51,985
Oh! Mom!

911
01:50:59,243 --> 01:50:59,868
Come on!

912
01:51:10,295 --> 01:51:11,296
The keys.

913
01:51:11,797 --> 01:51:13,090
They're gone.

914
01:51:13,257 --> 01:51:16,301
Where are the keys?
- What? Wait a minute. wait.

915
01:51:19,721 --> 01:51:21,348
I can't find them.

916
01:51:27,521 --> 01:51:29,606
I want Harry.

917
01:51:30,190 --> 01:51:32,651
Please, George, drive.
- Mom?

918
01:51:57,092 --> 01:51:58,177
George!

919
01:51:58,302 --> 01:52:01,805
No!
Nooo!

920
01:52:07,895 --> 01:52:09,396
It's just a dog.

921
01:52:19,490 --> 01:52:21,950
Harry!
 Come on, boy!

922
01:52:28,123 --> 01:52:29,333
Harry?

923
01:52:44,681 --> 01:52:46,183
Harry, come on!

924
01:52:47,559 --> 01:52:48,519
Harry?

925
01:53:33,355 --> 01:53:34,648
No, it's me!

926
01:53:40,571 --> 01:53:41,905
Harry, no.

927
01:53:43,323 --> 01:53:44,533
Harry!

928
01:53:45,951 --> 01:53:47,035
Harry.

929
01:53:52,249 --> 01:53:54,543
Pull, Harry. Pull.

930
01:53:56,628 --> 01:53:57,629
Harry.

931
01:54:00,466 --> 01:54:01,550
Harry ...

932
01:54:01,675 --> 01:54:02,676
pull!

933
01:54:17,649 --> 01:54:18,817
Good boy.

934
01:54:40,214 --> 01:54:41,173
Harry ...

935
01:54:42,758 --> 01:54:43,967
Come on, boy.

936
01:55:22,172 --> 01:55:25,676
Thank god.
Oh, thank god.
