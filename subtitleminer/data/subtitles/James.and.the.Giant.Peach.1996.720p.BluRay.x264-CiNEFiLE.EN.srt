00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:59,260
This is James Henry Trotter.

2
00:01:02,438 --> 00:01:07,599
He lived with his mother and father
in a cosy little house by the sea.

3
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:09,649
Hey. I've got ya.

4
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,646
Happy birthday, darling.

5
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:14,443
Now, quickly. Blow them out
before the wind does.

6
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:16,442
Make a wish first.

7
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,710
It was a wonderful life.

8
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:28,743
They had each other,
and they had their dreams.

9
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,338
Look!
That cloud looks like a camel.

10
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:37,471
And that one over there
looks like a train engine.

11
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:43,429
Now, can you see the tallest
building in the world?

12
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,771
I can't find it.

13
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,027
Try looking at it another way.

14
00:01:57,242 --> 00:02:00,197
I see it!

15
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:02,446
That's where we're going...

16
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:05,625
on a great ship that will
take us across the ocean.

17
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:08,830
And we'll go right to the top
of that building.

18
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:12,289
The three of us,
on top of the world.

19
00:02:12,383 --> 00:02:15,717
Are there any kids there like me?

20
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,712
Hundreds of them.

21
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:20,557
It's a wonderful place,James.

22
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:23,595
A city where dreams come true.

23
00:02:23,686 --> 00:02:27,765
Then, one day,
a terrible thing happened.

24
00:02:30,151 --> 00:02:33,069
An angry rhinoceros
appeared out of nowhere...

25
00:02:33,154 --> 00:02:37,151
and gobbled up
his poor mother and father.

26
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:39,733
Their troubles--
if they had any at all--

27
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:42,615
were over in 35 seconds flat.

28
00:02:45,667 --> 00:02:48,751
But James's troubles
were just beginning.

29
00:02:48,837 --> 00:02:52,750
For now, he lives here
with Aunt Sponge...

30
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,296
Get up, you lazy little bug.

31
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:57,293
and Aunt Spiker.

32
00:02:57,386 --> 00:03:01,053
- You already wasted
four minutes of daylight.
- Look at him.

33
00:03:01,141 --> 00:03:05,802
Lollygagging in dreamland when
there's so much work to be do.

34
00:03:05,895 --> 00:03:08,647
Weeds to pull, wood to chop.

35
00:03:08,732 --> 00:03:11,567
Work, work, work, work, work!

36
00:03:57,948 --> 00:04:00,984
Wouldn't want one of those
nesting in your knickers.

37
00:04:02,077 --> 00:04:06,785
I look and smell--
I do declare--

38
00:04:06,874 --> 00:04:08,784
as lovely as a rose.

39
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:12,042
Just feast your eyes upon my face.

40
00:04:12,128 --> 00:04:15,829
Observe my shapely nose.

41
00:04:15,925 --> 00:04:20,088
Behold my heavenly, silky locks.

42
00:04:20,178 --> 00:04:24,306
And if I take off
both my socks,

43
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:27,842
you'll see my dainty toes.

44
00:04:27,936 --> 00:04:31,021
But don't forget,
my dearest Sponge,

45
00:04:31,106 --> 00:04:34,273
how much your tummy shows.

46
00:04:48,832 --> 00:04:51,204
You lazy bug!

47
00:04:51,293 --> 00:04:55,290
- Who told you to stop working?
- I finished the wood.

48
00:04:57,132 --> 00:05:00,502
A travel book? How dare
you even dream of leaving!

49
00:05:00,594 --> 00:05:03,050
This is the only home
you'll ever have.

50
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:07,302
No one else would tolerate
a worthless little nothing like you.

51
00:05:07,393 --> 00:05:10,726
Where did you get this? Where?

52
00:05:10,812 --> 00:05:13,433
Father gave it to me.
He said we were to go there one day.

53
00:05:13,523 --> 00:05:17,357
- Stupid, foolish man.
- Foolish man. Always dreaming.

54
00:05:17,444 --> 00:05:20,482
- That's what got him killed.
- And your mother.

55
00:05:20,573 --> 00:05:23,823
Had his head in the clouds instead
of looking where he was going!

56
00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:29,035
- He never even saw that rhino coming.
- That rhino.

57
00:05:29,123 --> 00:05:33,369
And the beast will get you, too,
if you don't behave.

58
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:36,995
Now get these stupid dreams
out of your head!

59
00:05:37,089 --> 00:05:39,497
And get back to work!

60
00:05:50,019 --> 00:05:52,855
Careful, Spongy. Wouldn't want
to ruin that girlish figure.

61
00:05:52,939 --> 00:05:54,847
Oh, shut up.

62
00:05:58,153 --> 00:06:00,442
- Yes?
- I've finished all of the chores.

63
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:04,776
What a coincidence.
We've finished all the dinner.

64
00:06:04,868 --> 00:06:07,109
Oh, Sponge.
You're such a tease.

65
00:06:07,204 --> 00:06:10,537
There's something special
waiting for you in the oven.

66
00:06:19,757 --> 00:06:22,130
Oh, do let me guess.

67
00:06:22,219 --> 00:06:24,258
They're not good enough for him.

68
00:06:24,345 --> 00:06:26,718
What do you think this is?
Buckingham Palace?

69
00:06:29,726 --> 00:06:31,765
Get out of our sight!

70
00:06:31,853 --> 00:06:33,762
Go on!

71
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:36,474
Go on!

72
00:07:14,563 --> 00:07:17,931
Hello there!
Where did you come from?

73
00:07:18,025 --> 00:07:21,974
You know, you probably shouldn't
build your web up here in the window.

74
00:07:22,071 --> 00:07:25,688
Spiker and Sponge might see you,
and they hate spiders.

75
00:07:27,033 --> 00:07:30,449
I'll be your friend, though.

76
00:07:30,537 --> 00:07:35,163
<i>My name is James</i>

77
00:07:35,251 --> 00:07:39,794
<i>That's what Mother called me</i>

78
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:44,257
<i>My name is James</i>

79
00:07:44,343 --> 00:07:47,628
<i>So it's always been</i>

80
00:07:49,432 --> 00:07:53,215
<i>Sometimes I forget</i>

81
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:58,221
<i>When I'm lonely or afraid</i>

82
00:07:58,315 --> 00:08:03,227
<i>Then I'll go inside my head</i>

83
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:08,694
<i>And look for James</i>

84
00:08:08,784 --> 00:08:11,488
Here's something
I've never shown anyone.

85
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:21,502
<i>There's a city that I dreamed of</i>

86
00:08:21,589 --> 00:08:26,417
<i>Very far from here</i>

87
00:08:26,511 --> 00:08:31,256
<i>Very, very far away from here</i>

88
00:08:31,348 --> 00:08:36,343
<i>Very far away</i>

89
00:08:36,437 --> 00:08:40,980
<i>There are people in the city</i>

90
00:08:41,067 --> 00:08:45,479
<i>And they're kind to me</i>

91
00:08:45,571 --> 00:08:50,945
<i>But it's very, very far away
you know</i>

92
00:08:51,035 --> 00:08:53,609
<i>Very far</i>

93
00:08:55,374 --> 00:08:58,991
<i>They'll say, James, James</i>

94
00:08:59,085 --> 00:09:02,169
<i>James, how are ya</i>

95
00:09:02,254 --> 00:09:06,253
<i>Isn't it a lovely day</i>

96
00:09:07,761 --> 00:09:11,675
<i>James, James, James</i>

97
00:09:11,764 --> 00:09:15,548
<i>We're so glad you came here</i>

98
00:09:15,644 --> 00:09:17,683
<i>Where we are</i>

99
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:24,308
<i>From so very, very, very far</i>

100
00:09:24,402 --> 00:09:29,194
<i>My name is James</i>

101
00:09:29,283 --> 00:09:33,363
<i>James, James</i>

102
00:09:48,468 --> 00:09:50,876
Good night. Pleasant dreams.

103
00:09:58,479 --> 00:10:01,313
Spider! Vermin! Oh, beast!

104
00:10:03,192 --> 00:10:05,184
No! Wait!

105
00:10:05,277 --> 00:10:08,942
- Spider!
- Wait! I'll get it! I'll get it!

106
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:12,612
Kill it! Kill it! Kill it!

107
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,785
Where is it?

108
00:10:22,837 --> 00:10:24,875
Get it! Get it!

109
00:10:24,963 --> 00:10:26,920
- Kill it.
- Get it! Get it!

110
00:10:27,007 --> 00:10:29,629
Kill it!

111
00:10:32,429 --> 00:10:35,217
You hit me in the face.
You hit me in the face!

112
00:10:35,307 --> 00:10:37,264
Oh, do shut up!

113
00:10:44,691 --> 00:10:49,104
Go on. Get out of here. Get as far away
from this place as you possibly can.

114
00:10:49,196 --> 00:10:52,114
Oh, I wish I could.

115
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,192
What's stopping you?

116
00:10:54,284 --> 00:10:57,654
Oh, don't be frightened,James.
I mean you no harm.

117
00:10:59,122 --> 00:11:02,574
How'd you know my name?

118
00:11:02,667 --> 00:11:05,206
I know more than just your name.

119
00:11:06,797 --> 00:11:10,048
What would you say
if I were to tell you...

120
00:11:10,134 --> 00:11:13,917
that the answer to all
your troubles is right here...

121
00:11:14,012 --> 00:11:16,006
inside this little bag?

122
00:11:16,099 --> 00:11:19,183
- Hey! That's my--
- Of course it is.

123
00:11:19,268 --> 00:11:22,804
Go on,James. Have a look.

124
00:11:22,897 --> 00:11:25,934
There's more magic
in them things...

125
00:11:26,025 --> 00:11:28,267
than in all the rest
of the world put together.

126
00:11:28,361 --> 00:11:30,767
But what are they?

127
00:11:30,862 --> 00:11:33,899
- Crocodile tongues.
- Tongues?

128
00:11:33,991 --> 00:11:37,574
One thousand long,
slimy crocodile tongues.

129
00:11:37,662 --> 00:11:41,493
Boiled in the skull of a dead witch
for 20 days and 20 nights.

130
00:11:41,582 --> 00:11:45,034
Add the fingers of a young
monkey, the gizzard of a pig,

131
00:11:45,128 --> 00:11:48,044
the beak of a parrot
and three spoonfuls of sugar.

132
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:52,129
Stew for a week,
and then let the moon...

133
00:11:52,218 --> 00:11:54,424
do the rest.

134
00:11:54,512 --> 00:11:58,261
Have 'em, and marvelous things
will happen.

135
00:11:58,349 --> 00:12:01,220
Things even you never dreamt of.

136
00:12:01,311 --> 00:12:04,928
- Like what?
- Well, like...

137
00:12:05,023 --> 00:12:07,810
you'll never be miserable again.

138
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:12,609
And you are miserable,
aren't you,James?

139
00:12:12,697 --> 00:12:14,607
You weren't meant to be, you know.

140
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,321
And that place you're dreamin' of,

141
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:20,079
it's not as far away as you think.

142
00:12:25,043 --> 00:12:27,166
New York City!

143
00:12:27,254 --> 00:12:31,203
And it'll be that much closer,
once you take the first step.

144
00:12:31,299 --> 00:12:34,751
But how? This doesn't
make any sense.

145
00:12:34,844 --> 00:12:37,003
Not up here, it doesn't.

146
00:12:37,097 --> 00:12:39,385
The answers are in here,

147
00:12:39,474 --> 00:12:42,429
and the magic is in here.

148
00:12:44,229 --> 00:12:47,099
So,James, what'll it be?

149
00:12:54,657 --> 00:12:59,283
Now listen to me,James. Don't let them
get away, because if they do,

150
00:12:59,369 --> 00:13:04,495
they'll work their magic on whoever
or whatever they meet first.

151
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:07,205
Understand?

152
00:13:07,295 --> 00:13:09,501
Good.

153
00:13:21,558 --> 00:13:25,307
What's going on out here?

154
00:13:34,362 --> 00:13:36,321
No! No, wait!

155
00:13:39,659 --> 00:13:42,151
Wait! No! No, wait!

156
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,952
Wait.Just a-- Wait.

157
00:13:51,046 --> 00:13:53,917
Here he is.
Get up, you little worm!

158
00:13:54,008 --> 00:13:57,127
- We sent you out here to kill a spider.
- Not to laze about.

159
00:13:57,219 --> 00:13:59,888
I wasn't lazing about.
I tripped.

160
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:02,011
How dare you disagree with us!

161
00:14:02,099 --> 00:14:04,256
Beat him, Sponge.

162
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,430
It's too early.

163
00:14:08,524 --> 00:14:11,310
Well, that makes you
the luckiest boy alive.

164
00:14:11,401 --> 00:14:13,890
Now come inside and get dressed.

165
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:18,736
Spiker, look! A peach.

166
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:22,691
- A what?
- A peach! There! On that branch.

167
00:14:22,786 --> 00:14:27,579
Why, that old tree's never had so much
as a blossom on it, let alone a--

168
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,624
Well, I'll be blowed.

169
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:31,833
There really is a peach there.

170
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,875
A nice, big one too.

171
00:14:34,966 --> 00:14:36,874
How can we get it?

172
00:14:38,427 --> 00:14:41,796
- The boy.
- Now, you be a good little boy...

173
00:14:41,889 --> 00:14:45,933
and climb up there and get that
peach for your dear aunties.

174
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:49,103
- Can we eat it?
- Of course we can. We'll share it.

175
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:52,225
Me and your Aunt Spiker!
Now start climbing.

176
00:14:52,316 --> 00:14:55,353
- Wait!
- What? What? What?

177
00:14:55,444 --> 00:14:57,852
It's-It's growing!

178
00:14:57,947 --> 00:15:00,652
- The boy?
- No. The peach, you idiot!

179
00:15:00,742 --> 00:15:02,651
Look!

180
00:15:05,621 --> 00:15:07,946
- Come down.
- But I won't get hurt.

181
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,950
Climb down!

182
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:14,586
What a peach. What a peach!

183
00:15:14,672 --> 00:15:17,210
Look, Spiker! It's still growing!

184
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,171
I'm not blind, you dolt.
I can see it myself.

185
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:25,421
Look at it go! It's a miracle!

186
00:15:26,434 --> 00:15:30,052
It's coming down. Stand back!

187
00:15:30,146 --> 00:15:32,352
My heavens! My--

188
00:15:49,792 --> 00:15:53,242
Marvelous things will happen,
just like he said.

189
00:15:53,335 --> 00:15:55,294
Shut up, you little grub.

190
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:58,297
This has nothing to do with you,
so just keep away from it.

191
00:16:00,594 --> 00:16:05,754
Can you smell that, Spikey?
It smells delicious.

192
00:16:05,849 --> 00:16:08,221
No!

193
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:11,892
It smells like money.

194
00:16:16,025 --> 00:16:19,063
Roll up. Roll up.
See the giant peach.

195
00:16:19,154 --> 00:16:21,147
The Eighth Wonder of the World.

196
00:16:21,239 --> 00:16:23,279
Have your money ready,
ladies and gentlemen.

197
00:16:23,368 --> 00:16:27,614
Chance of a lifetime.
Ten bob only.

198
00:16:27,705 --> 00:16:31,749
No peeking at the peach! Have
your money ready, ladies and gentlemen.

199
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,827
In you go.

200
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,335
- Can we touch it?
- Touch it? You want to touch it?

201
00:16:37,423 --> 00:16:41,290
- She'll be wanting to taste it next.
- Admission refused.

202
00:16:41,385 --> 00:16:44,171
This child has too many
cheeky ideas. Go away!

203
00:16:44,263 --> 00:16:47,514
- Quite right.
- Ooh, splendid.

204
00:16:48,683 --> 00:16:50,926
A photographer.

205
00:16:52,187 --> 00:16:54,429
- And another.
- Best side.

206
00:16:56,024 --> 00:16:58,813
- Move on in.
- No cameras allowed.

207
00:16:58,903 --> 00:17:01,110
Don't dawdle. Come along,
ladies and gentlemen!

208
00:17:01,197 --> 00:17:03,948
- Sorry, Father. It'll cost you double.
- May God forgive you.

209
00:17:04,033 --> 00:17:05,941
Thank you, Father.

210
00:17:06,034 --> 00:17:08,870
Come along, children.
Last chance of the day.

211
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:15,208
Yoo-hoo! Come down here.

212
00:17:16,546 --> 00:17:18,953
Yes, Auntie Sponge?

213
00:17:19,048 --> 00:17:21,373
Ooh! You're all spiffed up.

214
00:17:21,467 --> 00:17:24,421
I was hoping to play
with the children.

215
00:17:26,056 --> 00:17:28,628
The children have gone.

216
00:17:28,723 --> 00:17:31,975
But you can play with their garbage.

217
00:17:32,062 --> 00:17:34,137
Garbage.

218
00:17:36,566 --> 00:17:40,267
And don't even think
of going near our peach.

219
00:17:40,362 --> 00:17:44,573
'Cause if you do, remember:
They never did catch that rhino.

220
00:18:17,941 --> 00:18:20,776
No! Wait a moment! Wait!

221
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:42,764
'Ere, now. Where do you think
you're going, Yank?

222
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:45,565
I'm goin' stir crazy.
I gotta take a look around.

223
00:19:45,654 --> 00:19:47,612
Plan our escape
from Spiker and Sponge.

224
00:19:47,699 --> 00:19:51,945
Escape? To where? We'll all be
squashed, swatted, smooshed!

225
00:19:52,036 --> 00:19:55,404
No one's going to smoosh you,
my dear boy.

226
00:19:55,497 --> 00:19:58,250
- You're six feet long now.
- Bigger target.

227
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:01,785
Let the biddies come.
I'll take 'em both on.

228
00:20:01,879 --> 00:20:04,915
I'm indefeatable.
I'm indivisible. I'm...

229
00:20:05,007 --> 00:20:07,130
- Whoa!
- in trouble!

230
00:20:09,095 --> 00:20:11,800
It's Spiker and Sponge!
They've found us!

231
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:14,261
Hello!

232
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:17,469
No, no, no. It's the lad
from the house. What's his name?

233
00:20:17,561 --> 00:20:20,765
- Miserable tick.
- I thought it was " rotten little grub.''

234
00:20:20,857 --> 00:20:23,312
No. That's what those
horrible aunts call him.

235
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,401
His real name is--
Well, it's-- uh, uh--

236
00:20:26,487 --> 00:20:28,563
It's James.

237
00:20:28,657 --> 00:20:32,191
Look what you've done now, miss.
Scared him to death.

238
00:20:32,284 --> 00:20:34,657
Please! Don't eat me!

239
00:20:34,745 --> 00:20:37,747
- Eat you?
- Hey, Glow-worm. Turn up your lights.

240
00:20:41,002 --> 00:20:43,836
- I'm a vegetarian.
- I eat dirt.

241
00:20:43,921 --> 00:20:45,831
No one will be eating you,James.

242
00:20:45,924 --> 00:20:49,506
Nah. She'll just puncture your
head and suck out the brains.

243
00:20:49,594 --> 00:20:53,508
- That I am saving for you.
- Whoa! Pretty fast, long legs.

244
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,851
Oh, such rude behaviour.

245
00:20:57,935 --> 00:21:00,343
There's no need
to be frightened, dearie.

246
00:21:00,438 --> 00:21:02,645
But you're enormous bugs!

247
00:21:02,732 --> 00:21:04,559
Fascinating, isn't it?

248
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:08,482
We've all changed,
and so have you,James.

249
00:21:09,948 --> 00:21:13,567
The old man-- the one who
gave me the green things--

250
00:21:13,659 --> 00:21:15,735
he said marvelous things
would happen.

251
00:21:15,828 --> 00:21:18,497
Did he say,
"marvelous pigs in satin''?

252
00:21:18,582 --> 00:21:22,829
No, dear lady.
"Marvelous things will happen.''

253
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:25,671
Poor Glow-worm.
She's a little deaf.

254
00:21:25,755 --> 00:21:28,211
I, however, have exquisite hearing.

255
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,458
Yeah? Well, listen to this.

256
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,890
Let's get outta here!

257
00:21:34,973 --> 00:21:38,721
You mean leave the hill?
I can't! The rhino will get me.

258
00:21:38,809 --> 00:21:40,887
Rhino?

259
00:21:40,979 --> 00:21:42,887
I say, dear boy.

260
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:45,187
I've lived on this
miserable hill for decades.

261
00:21:45,275 --> 00:21:47,185
There are no rhinoceri here.

262
00:21:47,278 --> 00:21:52,021
Except for Sponge.
She's twice as big as a rhino, eh, kid?

263
00:21:52,114 --> 00:21:55,366
And twice as dangerous.
My life hangs by a thread every day.

264
00:21:55,452 --> 00:21:59,117
I've had to send all 300
of me children to safer pastures.

265
00:21:59,206 --> 00:22:02,242
Hah! You think hiding
in solid rock is fun?

266
00:22:02,334 --> 00:22:04,457
I can't even remember what fun is.

267
00:22:04,545 --> 00:22:07,250
Well, that's just 'cause
you been stuck here too long.

268
00:22:07,338 --> 00:22:11,384
Listen to me, kid. I know a place
that will refresh your memory.

269
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:14,588
<i>Bright lights
Big city</i>

270
00:22:14,679 --> 00:22:16,886
<i>That's where we gotta go</i>

271
00:22:16,973 --> 00:22:20,010
<i>Where the food is great
and the bugs are so pretty</i>

272
00:22:20,101 --> 00:22:22,594
<i>I'd like to get my arms
around a hundred or so</i>

273
00:22:22,688 --> 00:22:25,605
<i>I'd hug 'em, squeeze 'em
hold 'em tight</i>

274
00:22:25,691 --> 00:22:27,648
<i>Sleep all day
Dance all night</i>

275
00:22:27,735 --> 00:22:30,854
<i>I want the bright lights
and the big city</i>

276
00:22:30,946 --> 00:22:34,944
<i>That's the life for me, yeah
That's the life for--</i>

277
00:22:35,033 --> 00:22:38,817
<i>You little maggot
Have you never seen the moon</i>

278
00:22:38,913 --> 00:22:42,826
<i>Gliding 'cross the western sky</i>

279
00:22:42,916 --> 00:22:47,293
<i>A dead oak tree by the waterside</i>

280
00:22:47,378 --> 00:22:51,542
<i>Putrid vapours rising</i>

281
00:22:53,385 --> 00:22:56,469
That sounds lovely, dear.
I'm sure we all agree.

282
00:22:56,554 --> 00:22:58,714
<i>But I prefer the sunshine</i>

283
00:22:58,807 --> 00:23:02,639
<i>A little park right in
the centre of the town</i>

284
00:23:02,728 --> 00:23:07,853
<i>Flowers everywhere
Children all around me, I'd love it</i>

285
00:23:07,942 --> 00:23:11,691
<i>Landing on a baby's cheek so warm</i>

286
00:23:11,779 --> 00:23:15,314
<i>- It's wonderful
- Wonderful</i>

287
00:23:15,407 --> 00:23:19,452
<i>That's the life for me</i>

288
00:23:19,536 --> 00:23:23,368
<i>That's the life for me</i>

289
00:23:23,458 --> 00:23:27,621
<i>That's the life
That's the life for me</i>

290
00:23:30,423 --> 00:23:34,171
<i>- Elegant conversation
- Bright lights, big city</i>

291
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:37,842
<i>- An elevated point of view
- That's where I'd go</i>

292
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:41,714
<i>- Intellectual stimulation
- Yeah, maybe for you.</i>

293
00:23:41,809 --> 00:23:45,937
<i>And someone you love
to share it with you</i>

294
00:23:48,607 --> 00:23:51,360
<i>It would be wonderful</i>

295
00:23:51,444 --> 00:23:53,353
<i>Wonderful</i>

296
00:23:53,446 --> 00:23:57,029
<i>- That's the life for me
- You call that a life?</i>

297
00:23:57,117 --> 00:24:00,615
<i>- That's the life for me
- It's no pile of dirt.</i>

298
00:24:00,704 --> 00:24:03,195
<i>That's the life
That's the life</i>

299
00:24:03,289 --> 00:24:07,287
<i>That's the life
That's the life for--</i>

300
00:24:07,376 --> 00:24:09,535
Where are you hiding, boy?

301
00:24:09,629 --> 00:24:12,832
Time to go make a pest of myself.

302
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:17,917
Look at this place.
It's still filthy.

303
00:24:18,012 --> 00:24:21,048
Where are you,
you detestable little worm?

304
00:24:21,141 --> 00:24:23,596
Not you. Me!

305
00:24:23,685 --> 00:24:26,851
You better not be near our peach.

306
00:24:26,937 --> 00:24:29,476
Oh, please!
Don't let them spray us!

307
00:24:29,566 --> 00:24:33,183
Spray us? They'll see the Yank up there
and come after us with a shovel.

308
00:24:33,277 --> 00:24:35,686
- It happened to my brother.
- How awful.

309
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:39,612
Split him right down the middle.
Now I have two half-brothers.

310
00:24:39,702 --> 00:24:42,536
Shh! They'll hear us.

311
00:24:44,205 --> 00:24:47,290
Yoo-hoo! Where are you, boy?

312
00:24:47,375 --> 00:24:51,420
I think I hear a rhino out here.

313
00:24:53,465 --> 00:24:56,039
Ahh. This'll be a snap.

314
00:24:58,177 --> 00:25:01,797
Shh! I really do hear something.

315
00:25:09,398 --> 00:25:11,722
Timber.

316
00:25:14,527 --> 00:25:16,852
- What's that?
- Fasten your seat belts, kids.

317
00:25:17,948 --> 00:25:20,782
Ahh! The car!

318
00:25:20,867 --> 00:25:23,738
- We're turning!
- Wha-Wha-What have you done?

319
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,248
Start, start, you piece of junk.

320
00:25:37,885 --> 00:25:40,210
It's the peach! Our peach!
We'll be killed!

321
00:25:45,308 --> 00:25:48,428
Whoa! I'm falling head
over head over head!

322
00:26:11,127 --> 00:26:14,164
Here, stomach! Here, stomach!
Here, stomach!

323
00:26:23,473 --> 00:26:25,512
I'm gonna be sick.

324
00:26:31,898 --> 00:26:35,432
Our peach!

325
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:48,528
Where are we?

326
00:26:48,622 --> 00:26:51,196
Ow! Somebody pinched me.

327
00:26:51,292 --> 00:26:53,914
Sorry. I thought
you were the spider.

328
00:26:54,003 --> 00:26:56,459
Ouch! What was that?

329
00:26:56,547 --> 00:26:58,955
Excuse. I thought
you were the centipede.

330
00:26:59,049 --> 00:27:01,458
Hey, Glow-worm.
How about some light?

331
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:04,423
I can't hear you, dear.
I'll have to put my light on.

332
00:27:04,514 --> 00:27:08,131
Oh! Oh! This is
so "unladybug-like.''

333
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:12,271
Don't worry. I'll have you
right-side up in no time.

334
00:27:12,356 --> 00:27:14,311
Thank you,James.

335
00:27:14,398 --> 00:27:17,316
- Where are you going?
- To see where we've landed.

336
00:27:24,701 --> 00:27:26,908
Whoa!

337
00:27:36,338 --> 00:27:38,247
Oh, my!

338
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,463
Oh, my, my.

339
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:43,919
Oh, my achin' back.

340
00:27:44,846 --> 00:27:47,218
Oh!

341
00:27:47,307 --> 00:27:49,347
Fascinating, isn't it?

342
00:27:49,435 --> 00:27:53,135
What? What's fascinating?
Tell me. Don't leave me dangling.

343
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:57,939
We're in the middle of the--
how do you say-- the big puddle?

344
00:27:58,026 --> 00:28:02,772
Biggest puddle of them all,
angel fangs. The Atlantic Ocean.

345
00:28:02,865 --> 00:28:05,319
Technically,
the Pacific is larger.

346
00:28:05,409 --> 00:28:08,695
Well, that goes without saying.

347
00:28:08,788 --> 00:28:10,447
But there is land in sight?

348
00:28:10,539 --> 00:28:13,030
Nothing but blue skies
and clear waters.

349
00:28:14,918 --> 00:28:16,959
- This is all your fault.
- Hey!

350
00:28:17,046 --> 00:28:20,497
If it wasn't for me, we'd all
be Spiked and Sponged by now!

351
00:28:20,591 --> 00:28:22,832
This old man
with his green things--

352
00:28:22,926 --> 00:28:25,548
did he happen to speak
to where we are going?

353
00:28:25,638 --> 00:28:29,884
No. All he said was
the answers would be right here.

354
00:28:32,228 --> 00:28:34,801
My travel book!

355
00:28:34,897 --> 00:28:38,313
And look! It's the peach!

356
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:42,065
We're going to New York City!

357
00:28:42,153 --> 00:28:44,727
New York? They love me there!

358
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:48,573
Wonderful! They've got a whole park
full of leaves for you, Miss Ladybug.

359
00:28:48,661 --> 00:28:51,578
- Central Park.
- And loads of dark hiding places.

360
00:28:51,663 --> 00:28:53,989
- Nightclubs.
- And museums and concerts.

361
00:28:54,083 --> 00:28:57,000
- Not to mention Yankee Stadium.
- What about me?

362
00:28:57,085 --> 00:28:59,837
Why, they've got miles and miles
of underground tunnels.

363
00:28:59,923 --> 00:29:01,085
The subway!

364
00:29:01,173 --> 00:29:04,340
My father says it's the place
where dreams come true.

365
00:29:04,427 --> 00:29:07,877
<i>- That's the life for me
- That's the life for me</i>

366
00:29:07,971 --> 00:29:11,555
<i>- That's the life for me
- That's the life for me</i>

367
00:29:11,642 --> 00:29:14,513
<i>- That's the life
- That's the life</i>

368
00:29:14,604 --> 00:29:16,062
<i>That's the life</i>

369
00:29:16,147 --> 00:29:21,935
<i>That's the life for me</i>

370
00:29:22,027 --> 00:29:24,697
New York it is, then.

371
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:26,903
Now, how do we get there?

372
00:29:26,991 --> 00:29:29,279
- I'll get us there!
- You?

373
00:29:29,368 --> 00:29:32,903
Sure! I've sailed
all the five seas.

374
00:29:32,997 --> 00:29:35,534
From the sun-drenched reefs
of Bora Bora...

375
00:29:35,624 --> 00:29:39,540
to the icy shores of Tripoli.

376
00:29:39,629 --> 00:29:42,915
"Commodore Centipede,''
they used to call me.

377
00:29:43,006 --> 00:29:44,916
- Seven.
- Huh?

378
00:29:45,009 --> 00:29:47,049
There are seven seas,

379
00:29:47,137 --> 00:29:51,466
and Tripoli is
in the subtropics, Commodore.

380
00:29:51,557 --> 00:29:54,642
- Trim the sails!
- There are no sails.

381
00:29:54,727 --> 00:29:57,349
- Stoke the engine!
- There are no engines.

382
00:29:57,438 --> 00:29:59,846
I can't work
with this miserable crew.

383
00:29:59,941 --> 00:30:03,356
Great! We're stuck here
until we shrivel up and die.

384
00:30:03,444 --> 00:30:05,734
- Highly improbable.
- That's a relief.

385
00:30:05,823 --> 00:30:07,944
We're far more likely to drown.

386
00:30:08,032 --> 00:30:10,701
Oh, no!

387
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:14,159
I know! We could--

388
00:30:14,247 --> 00:30:16,737
No. It's a stupid idea.

389
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:19,075
- Compared to what?
- Hey!

390
00:30:19,169 --> 00:30:23,036
Well, we could fly out.

391
00:30:23,131 --> 00:30:25,373
He's right. It's stupid.

392
00:30:25,466 --> 00:30:27,376
How would you do it,James?

393
00:30:27,468 --> 00:30:30,220
With the seagulls,
but we'll need string.

394
00:30:30,305 --> 00:30:32,262
Oh. Well, I'll just go
to the stationer's...

395
00:30:32,348 --> 00:30:34,507
and pick up some paper clips
while I'm at it.

396
00:30:34,601 --> 00:30:38,433
I have string.
Miles of string.

397
00:30:38,522 --> 00:30:41,772
And we'll need bait; bird bait.

398
00:30:41,858 --> 00:30:45,642
Bird bait? Where do you expect
we're gonna find bird bait...

399
00:30:45,738 --> 00:30:48,524
out here in the middle
of the-- the--

400
00:30:48,615 --> 00:30:51,985
Oh, no! No, no!

401
00:30:52,077 --> 00:30:55,446
Have you lost your minds?

402
00:30:55,539 --> 00:30:57,496
They've lost their minds!

403
00:30:57,583 --> 00:30:59,540
Anything but birds!

404
00:30:59,627 --> 00:31:01,832
Don't worry. I'm right here.

405
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:03,829
- Now wiggle.
- No!

406
00:31:03,923 --> 00:31:05,797
But they won't come
if you don't wiggle.

407
00:31:05,883 --> 00:31:08,290
Exactly!
And you can't make me.

408
00:31:08,385 --> 00:31:10,295
Oh, yeah?

409
00:31:13,723 --> 00:31:17,389
Hey, no fair! Mockingbirds
munched me mother!

410
00:31:19,979 --> 00:31:23,599
Here comes the first one.
Get ready to pull down there.

411
00:31:23,692 --> 00:31:26,610
My sisters were swallowed
by swallows!

412
00:31:27,989 --> 00:31:30,561
Pull!

413
00:31:37,748 --> 00:31:40,618
It worked! I got one!

414
00:31:40,835 --> 00:31:42,707
Shh! I hear teeth.

415
00:31:42,794 --> 00:31:45,417
Great, big, gnashing teeth.

416
00:31:45,506 --> 00:31:48,341
Sounds like a rhinoceros.

417
00:31:48,426 --> 00:31:52,554
In the ocean?
Scientifically impossible.

418
00:31:52,638 --> 00:31:55,805
I hear something too.

419
00:31:55,891 --> 00:31:58,097
It's a school of tuna.

420
00:31:58,185 --> 00:32:00,557
They're being sucked
into some sort of machine.

421
00:32:00,646 --> 00:32:03,600
- What do you mean?
- Take a look.

422
00:32:07,904 --> 00:32:09,979
It's a giant shark!

423
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:17,448
It seems to have spotted us.

424
00:32:20,667 --> 00:32:23,501
- What do we do? What do we do?
- The seagulls!

425
00:32:23,586 --> 00:32:25,246
It's our only chance!

426
00:32:25,338 --> 00:32:29,418
It would take the whole flock and
then some. We'll never do it in time.

427
00:32:29,508 --> 00:32:31,880
We'll use Miss Spider's web
for a net. Hurry!

428
00:32:35,055 --> 00:32:37,677
Throw it here, dearie.

429
00:32:41,311 --> 00:32:43,934
Wiggle, Mr Earthworm.
Our lives depend on it.

430
00:32:44,023 --> 00:32:46,858
I can't! I'm all wiggled out.

431
00:32:47,944 --> 00:32:51,563
Here. Let me help you.

432
00:32:51,656 --> 00:32:56,816
Come and get it!
Get your fresh, hot wienie!

433
00:32:59,454 --> 00:33:02,029
Come on, baby.

434
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:09,380
I got 'em! Hand me the loops!

435
00:33:09,465 --> 00:33:11,375
- Hurry!
- Shake a leg, there.

436
00:33:11,469 --> 00:33:14,172
Keep your pants on.
I've only got 1 2 hands.

437
00:33:17,391 --> 00:33:20,059
It's getting closer.

438
00:33:20,143 --> 00:33:22,301
Seagulls, away!

439
00:33:37,701 --> 00:33:39,861
- Oh, no!
- Oh, dear!

440
00:33:53,635 --> 00:33:56,008
They're getting away!

441
00:33:56,096 --> 00:33:58,765
Hop on,James!

442
00:33:58,849 --> 00:34:01,423
Now, grab them!

443
00:34:06,065 --> 00:34:09,231
Help!

444
00:34:13,697 --> 00:34:16,485
Hooligans! Ruffians!

445
00:34:16,575 --> 00:34:18,734
Degenerates!

446
00:34:24,959 --> 00:34:28,245
- Come on, seagulls!
- Put your backs into it!

447
00:34:28,337 --> 00:34:30,495
Shake your bloomin' tail feathers!

448
00:34:32,759 --> 00:34:35,331
Good sharky. Nice sharky.

449
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,964
Sharky!

450
00:35:08,002 --> 00:35:09,958
Hooray!

451
00:35:10,046 --> 00:35:15,669
All right! Teach you to mess
with me, you overgrown sardine!

452
00:35:15,759 --> 00:35:18,333
I'm from Brooklyn.

453
00:35:18,429 --> 00:35:23,175
Pure twaddle! Every bug on board
displayed extraordinary courage.

454
00:35:23,268 --> 00:35:26,054
Why, did you see Miss Ladybug
risk life and wing...

455
00:35:26,145 --> 00:35:28,684
to bash those brutes
on the snoot?

456
00:35:28,773 --> 00:35:32,688
Well, they were being very rude.
I can't abide rudeness.

457
00:35:32,777 --> 00:35:34,686
We are all
forgetting something.

458
00:35:34,778 --> 00:35:38,314
Everything we did was part
of the brilliant plan of James.

459
00:35:38,407 --> 00:35:42,275
It really did work, didn't it?

460
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:46,747
- I say three cheers for James. Hip-hip.
- Hooray!

461
00:35:46,833 --> 00:35:48,540
- Hip-hip.
- Hooray!

462
00:35:48,626 --> 00:35:51,497
- Hip-hip.
- Hooray!

463
00:35:52,463 --> 00:35:54,919
New York,

464
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:57,759
here we come!

465
00:36:15,529 --> 00:36:17,984
Whoever you are,
keep away from me! Keep away!

466
00:36:18,072 --> 00:36:21,774
Mr Earthworm, it's me!

467
00:36:21,868 --> 00:36:24,157
Oh,James!
Oh, thank goodness.

468
00:36:24,245 --> 00:36:27,033
You mustn't frighten yourself
like this all the time.

469
00:36:27,123 --> 00:36:29,994
- Why not?
- You'll make yourself sick.

470
00:36:30,085 --> 00:36:34,378
When I had a problem, my mum and dad
would tell me to look at it another way.

471
00:36:34,464 --> 00:36:38,248
How? First I was bird bait.
Then I was shark bait.

472
00:36:38,343 --> 00:36:42,423
I suppose. Or you could say
you gave us wings to fly...

473
00:36:42,513 --> 00:36:46,014
and defeated a giant shark
single-handedly.

474
00:36:46,101 --> 00:36:49,801
- No-handedly.
- Exactly. You're a hero.

475
00:36:49,897 --> 00:36:53,978
I am? I'm Wonder Worm!

476
00:36:54,067 --> 00:36:56,024
You are.

477
00:37:07,872 --> 00:37:10,114
Want food.

478
00:37:10,208 --> 00:37:12,118
Food.

479
00:37:16,548 --> 00:37:18,872
Are you sure you know
where we're going?

480
00:37:18,967 --> 00:37:21,424
I don't see how you can navigate
without a compass.

481
00:37:25,557 --> 00:37:28,262
It's very hot up here.
I'm roasted.

482
00:37:41,114 --> 00:37:45,575
- Unhand that bird!
- But I'm dyin' of hunger.

483
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:48,746
Well, perhaps I have a bit
of soda bread in here somewhere.

484
00:37:48,831 --> 00:37:51,404
- Food?
- It's not much, but it's--

485
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,161
- Not so fast!
- Hey!
- You?

486
00:37:53,252 --> 00:37:55,873
I need this food.
I have a much higher metabolism.

487
00:37:55,963 --> 00:37:58,455
- Bite me!
- What?
- Have you two gone mad?

488
00:37:58,549 --> 00:38:00,541
Let go of it, gramps!

489
00:38:00,634 --> 00:38:02,628
- Give it! Give it to me!
- Let go of my coat!
- Give it to me!

490
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,843
- Ow! My lower thorax.
- I'll rip you apart!

491
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:07,256
- I tell you, it's mine!
- Give it back!

492
00:38:11,395 --> 00:38:13,602
Now look what you've done!

493
00:38:13,689 --> 00:38:17,639
We're going to starve.
Waste away. And not quickly.

494
00:38:17,735 --> 00:38:21,733
Oh, no. That would be
the easy way out. We'll linger.

495
00:38:21,823 --> 00:38:25,026
Slowly. Miserably. Painfully.

496
00:38:25,117 --> 00:38:28,320
Nobody's going to starve.

497
00:38:28,412 --> 00:38:32,456
Don't you see? We have enough
food here for five voyages.

498
00:38:32,542 --> 00:38:35,163
- Food? Where?
- Is there really food?
- What are you talkin' about?

499
00:38:35,254 --> 00:38:37,210
Our whole ship is made of food.

500
00:38:37,296 --> 00:38:40,748
Oh, such a clever little boy.

501
00:38:40,842 --> 00:38:42,253
Takes after me.

502
00:38:42,343 --> 00:38:44,750
After you,
there is nothing left to take.

503
00:38:45,596 --> 00:38:47,672
Delectable!

504
00:38:47,765 --> 00:38:51,181
- Better than aphids.
- Better than ladybugs.

505
00:38:51,269 --> 00:38:53,345
- What?
- Excuse.

506
00:38:53,439 --> 00:38:57,270
It's not dirt, but it's not bad.

507
00:38:57,358 --> 00:39:00,561
"Not bad''? It's the best thing
I've ever tasted,

508
00:39:00,653 --> 00:39:03,654
and I have tasted a lot.

509
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:15,409
<i>I've eaten many strange
and scrumptious dishes in my time</i>

510
00:39:15,501 --> 00:39:18,171
<i>Like chilli bugs
and curried slugs</i>

511
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:21,125
<i>And earwigs
cooked in slime</i>

512
00:39:21,216 --> 00:39:23,968
<i>And mice with rice
is very nice</i>

513
00:39:24,052 --> 00:39:27,302
<i>When they're roasted
in their prime</i>

514
00:39:27,389 --> 00:39:31,885
<i>But don't forget to sprinkle them
with just a pinch of grime</i>

515
00:39:38,233 --> 00:39:41,399
<i>I'm crazy 'bout mosquitos
on a piece of buttered toast</i>

516
00:39:41,485 --> 00:39:45,104
<i>And pickled spines of porcupines
and then a great, big roast</i>

517
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:47,156
<i>And dragon's flesh
Quite old, not fresh</i>

518
00:39:47,243 --> 00:39:49,780
<i>It costs a buck at most</i>

519
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:52,492
Does it come with gravy?

520
00:39:52,581 --> 00:39:55,914
<i>It comes to you in barrels
if you order it by post</i>

521
00:40:06,302 --> 00:40:09,506
<i>It comes to you in barrels
if you order it by post</i>

522
00:40:09,639 --> 00:40:11,716
<i>For dinner on my birthday</i>

523
00:40:11,808 --> 00:40:14,180
<i>Shall I tell you
what I chose</i>

524
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:19,181
<i>Hot noodles made of poodles
on a slice of garden hose</i>

525
00:40:19,275 --> 00:40:21,847
<i>And a rather smelly jelly</i>

526
00:40:21,944 --> 00:40:24,612
<i>Made of armadillos' toes</i>

527
00:40:24,696 --> 00:40:27,022
<i>The jelly is delicious</i>

528
00:40:27,116 --> 00:40:31,244
<i>But you have to hold
your nose</i>

529
00:40:31,328 --> 00:40:34,662
<i>Peach, peach, peach, peach
Peach, peach, peach, peach</i>

530
00:40:34,749 --> 00:40:37,584
<i>Peach, peach, peach, peach</i>

531
00:40:37,668 --> 00:40:41,038
<i>I crave the tasty tentacles
of octopi for tea</i>

532
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:46,255
<i>I like hot dogs but I love hot frogs
and surely you'll agree</i>

533
00:40:46,343 --> 00:40:50,258
<i>A plate of soil with engine oil's
a super recipe</i>

534
00:40:50,347 --> 00:40:53,017
<i>Recipe</i>

535
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:55,592
<i>I hardly need to mention
that it's practically free</i>

536
00:40:55,687 --> 00:40:58,259
<i>Peach, peach, peach, peach
Peach, peach, peach, peach</i>

537
00:40:58,355 --> 00:41:01,439
<i>Peach, peach, peach, peach
Peach, peach, peach, peach</i>

538
00:41:01,525 --> 00:41:06,436
<i>We hardly need to mention
that it's practically free</i>

539
00:41:06,531 --> 00:41:11,276
<i>Now comes, my fellow travelers
the burden of my speech</i>

540
00:41:11,368 --> 00:41:15,781
<i>- You show-off!
- These foods are rare, beyond compare</i>

541
00:41:15,873 --> 00:41:19,159
<i>And some right out of reach</i>

542
00:41:19,252 --> 00:41:21,208
Nice aim, Commodore.

543
00:41:21,295 --> 00:41:24,129
<i>But there's no doubt
I'd go without</i>

544
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:27,834
<i>A million plates of each</i>

545
00:41:27,928 --> 00:41:29,884
Out of my face!

546
00:41:29,971 --> 00:41:32,888
<i>- For one small mite
- One small mite</i>

547
00:41:32,974 --> 00:41:34,966
<i>One tiny bite</i>

548
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:44,811
<i>Tiny bite
of this fantastic peach</i>

549
00:41:44,903 --> 00:41:47,903
<i>- Peach, peach, peach, peach
Peach, peach, peach, peach
- Stop! Stop!</i>

550
00:41:47,989 --> 00:41:50,659
<i>- Peach, peach, peach, peach
- Wha-Wha-Wha-What's going on?</i>

551
00:41:50,741 --> 00:41:54,158
- Bull's-eye!
- Comin' at you!
- Watch this!

552
00:41:54,246 --> 00:41:56,202
<i>This fantastic peach</i>

553
00:42:24,943 --> 00:42:26,853
You keep to yourself, don't you?

554
00:42:26,946 --> 00:42:29,352
I prefer to be alone.

555
00:42:29,447 --> 00:42:32,448
I was alone
for a long time once.

556
00:42:32,534 --> 00:42:35,868
I think it's much nicer
to have friends. Don't you?

557
00:42:35,955 --> 00:42:37,911
I would not know.

558
00:42:37,997 --> 00:42:42,493
They would be your friends too-- the
others, I mean-- if you'd just let them.

559
00:42:42,585 --> 00:42:45,503
No. It is in their nature
to have fear of me.

560
00:42:45,588 --> 00:42:49,421
- This I cannot change.
- You're very kind to me.

561
00:42:49,509 --> 00:42:54,385
Maybe this is because
you are kind to me first.

562
00:42:54,472 --> 00:42:56,929
You were the spider in my window!

563
00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:00,927
You were my first friend.

564
00:43:01,021 --> 00:43:04,472
I mean, since I went
to live with my aunts.

565
00:43:04,566 --> 00:43:08,813
- They hated me!
- Shh! Do not think of them now.

566
00:43:08,903 --> 00:43:10,813
But what if they find us?

567
00:43:10,907 --> 00:43:13,574
What if we don't make it
to New York?

568
00:43:13,659 --> 00:43:18,285
I'll die if I have to go back to
the way I was! They can't make me!

569
00:43:18,372 --> 00:43:23,828
Nobody can make you do anything,
James, if you do not let them.

570
00:43:23,918 --> 00:43:27,253
You are a brave boy.

571
00:43:27,339 --> 00:43:29,747
Now, to sleep.

572
00:43:29,842 --> 00:43:32,879
You have had
a very tired-making day.

573
00:44:11,342 --> 00:44:16,004
Look! The little maggot's
stuffing his face with our peach!

574
00:44:16,096 --> 00:44:18,553
Get him, Sponge.

575
00:44:20,018 --> 00:44:22,722
You can't crawl away from us!

576
00:44:36,826 --> 00:44:40,609
- The rhino will get you.
- The rhino will get you.

577
00:44:40,704 --> 00:44:44,489
- The rhino will get you.
- The rhino will get you.

578
00:44:44,584 --> 00:44:48,533
The rhino will get you.
The rhino will get you.

579
00:44:48,629 --> 00:44:51,334
The rhino will get you!

580
00:45:21,371 --> 00:45:23,494
This is an outrage!

581
00:45:23,582 --> 00:45:27,282
You are a disgrace to your phylum,
class, order, genus and species!

582
00:45:27,377 --> 00:45:30,164
- Say it in English!
- You, sir, are an ass!

583
00:45:30,254 --> 00:45:33,043
Where are we?
What's going on?

584
00:45:33,133 --> 00:45:36,965
I found this dime-store Timmy
asleep at the helm.

585
00:45:37,054 --> 00:45:39,379
- Now we're lost.
- We are not lost!

586
00:45:39,473 --> 00:45:41,715
- Then where are we?
- Somewhere north!

587
00:45:41,808 --> 00:45:43,717
Or possibly
very, very far south.

588
00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:46,219
What's your latitude?
What's your longitude?

589
00:45:46,314 --> 00:45:49,148
Hey, hey, hey!
That's personal, bub.

590
00:45:49,232 --> 00:45:53,064
- You said you could navigate!
- You said you'd traveled the world.

591
00:45:53,153 --> 00:45:55,193
You said you'd been to Bora Bora.

592
00:45:55,281 --> 00:46:00,073
- Well, not Bora Bora, per se. Uh--
- What about the shores of Tripoli?

593
00:46:00,161 --> 00:46:04,240
Did I say "Tripoli''?
I meant the halls of Montezuma.

594
00:46:04,331 --> 00:46:06,324
- That's what you said.
- Never have I heard such mendacity!

595
00:46:06,416 --> 00:46:08,659
- You liar.
- Charlatan!
- Wait!

596
00:46:08,752 --> 00:46:12,252
If he says he's seen the world,
then he's seen the world.

597
00:46:12,339 --> 00:46:15,294
Right, Mr Centipede?
Right?

598
00:46:15,384 --> 00:46:20,544
<i>Well, I did used to live between
two pages of a National Geographic.</i>

599
00:46:20,638 --> 00:46:25,930
<i>-Huh?
-Very informative magazine, the National
Geographic. Wonderful pictures.</i>

600
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:30,930
You incompetent,
blithering nitwit!

601
00:46:31,024 --> 00:46:34,144
All right, hoppy!
Them's fightin' words!

602
00:46:34,235 --> 00:46:37,355
Put 'em up! Put 'em up!
Come on! Give me your best shot!

603
00:46:38,866 --> 00:46:43,528
Whoa! Good shot.
Did you see what he did to me?

604
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:46,906
Hmph! Serves ya right.

605
00:46:46,998 --> 00:46:50,783
- What do we do now? Which way do we go?
- Oh, it's simple, really.

606
00:46:50,877 --> 00:46:52,870
All we need to do
is determine our coordinates,

607
00:46:52,964 --> 00:46:55,964
then use triangulation to chart
a direct route to New York.

608
00:46:56,049 --> 00:46:58,043
- Then there's hope.
- Don't be ridiculous.

609
00:46:58,136 --> 00:47:01,469
There's no hope at all.
We don't have a compass.

610
00:47:01,556 --> 00:47:03,513
We'll never reach New York.

611
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:05,639
We're gonna be stuck here forever.

612
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:08,479
We're gonna be frozen
like living statues.

613
00:47:08,563 --> 00:47:10,722
Dead living statues.

614
00:47:10,814 --> 00:47:13,270
No dark hiding places.

615
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:16,360
No cosy leaf in the park.

616
00:47:16,446 --> 00:47:20,906
No city where dreams come true.

617
00:47:20,992 --> 00:47:23,696
- Don't ships have compasses?
- No doubt.

618
00:47:23,785 --> 00:47:28,532
But to brave those icy waters
would mean certain death.

619
00:47:28,624 --> 00:47:30,582
Only a fool would do it.

620
00:47:33,254 --> 00:47:35,496
Geronimo!

621
00:47:35,589 --> 00:47:38,163
- What? What? What was that?
- The centipede jumped in!

622
00:47:38,259 --> 00:47:41,461
Good heavens!
He's committed pesticide!

623
00:47:41,554 --> 00:47:43,511
Oh, this is all my doing.

624
00:47:43,598 --> 00:47:46,005
Don't take all the credit.
I helped too.

625
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:50,181
- I have to go after him!
- Not on your life. You'll catch
your death of cold.

626
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:53,059
- But he's my friend!
-James is right.

627
00:47:53,149 --> 00:47:56,685
Centipede is one of us.
Get on my back. I am going with you.

628
00:47:56,778 --> 00:47:59,862
- You had better take good care of him.
- This I promise.

629
00:47:59,947 --> 00:48:03,068
Stay by the line, and when
you feel two tugs, pull us up.

630
00:48:30,895 --> 00:48:33,304
A skellington?

631
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:42,527
Jackpot! A genuine compass!

632
00:48:44,743 --> 00:48:47,234
Sounds like you need
a little oil, Captain.

633
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:51,665
Thank you, sir!
I'll be shovin' off now.

634
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:01,167
I shoulda worn a belt!

635
00:49:04,222 --> 00:49:07,138
Holy shipwreck!

636
00:49:21,863 --> 00:49:25,067
Listen, fellas. I got
a long history of back problems,

637
00:49:25,159 --> 00:49:28,195
and I don't need it
to get any longer.

638
00:49:33,042 --> 00:49:34,998
Hey. That one felt pretty good.

639
00:49:37,046 --> 00:49:39,962
It's Paul Bunyan comin'
to cut me some slack.

640
00:49:40,049 --> 00:49:43,464
Whoa! Hey, pal.
You're aimin' a little low.

641
00:49:43,552 --> 00:49:45,794
He's gonna cut me in half!

642
00:49:49,349 --> 00:49:53,477
Hey, sailors!
Looking for some kicks?

643
00:49:56,606 --> 00:49:58,564
Cut me loose!

644
00:50:04,657 --> 00:50:06,649
Get the compass!

645
00:50:10,913 --> 00:50:13,997
I've got it!

646
00:50:22,717 --> 00:50:24,626
Gotcha!

647
00:50:26,012 --> 00:50:28,385
Polly want a smacker?

648
00:50:30,183 --> 00:50:32,342
Look out!

649
00:50:35,271 --> 00:50:37,892
- Sounds like big trouble.
- Get ready to pull.

650
00:50:41,611 --> 00:50:45,941
I got a good one for ya. Why don't
skeletons play music in church?

651
00:51:05,759 --> 00:51:08,466
Oh. Thank goodness!
You're all right.

652
00:51:08,554 --> 00:51:11,093
- What happened to Centipede?
- He found a compass for us.

653
00:51:11,182 --> 00:51:15,132
- And a shipload of pirates!
- Hold this. I am going back.

654
00:51:15,228 --> 00:51:17,517
Do be careful, Miss Spider.

655
00:51:25,822 --> 00:51:27,980
Poor Centipede.

656
00:51:28,074 --> 00:51:30,946
He saved our lives down there.

657
00:51:31,036 --> 00:51:32,993
- Look out!
- Miss Spider!

658
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:39,703
- Centipede!
- How am I lookin', kid?

659
00:51:39,794 --> 00:51:45,252
Oh, Centipede. I do not know
whether to kill you or kiss you.

660
00:51:47,093 --> 00:51:49,846
- Well, I-- Say, I'm sorry.
- I'm so sorry.

661
00:51:49,931 --> 00:51:52,421
- My sincere apologies.
- I just, I just wanna apologize.

662
00:51:52,516 --> 00:51:54,592
- I just wanted to say--
- What I'm tryin' to say--

663
00:51:54,684 --> 00:51:56,926
That's enough chit-chat!
I'm freezing!

664
00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:59,097
Hello? The compass is ready.

665
00:51:59,189 --> 00:52:02,439
Mr Centipede, would you please
do us the honour...

666
00:52:02,525 --> 00:52:04,851
of navigating us
out of this icebox?

667
00:52:04,945 --> 00:52:07,103
It would be my pleasure.

668
00:52:07,198 --> 00:52:09,154
I believe our position
puts us very close to--

669
00:52:09,241 --> 00:52:12,693
I admire your bravery,
Miss Spider. I really do.

670
00:52:12,787 --> 00:52:15,538
Why, thank you, Mrs Ladybug.

671
00:52:15,623 --> 00:52:18,659
All right, boys.
Coffee break's over.

672
00:52:24,256 --> 00:52:27,257
I'm looking forward
to a hopping good time...

673
00:52:27,342 --> 00:52:29,964
in the Big Apple, Mr Centipede.

674
00:52:30,054 --> 00:52:33,090
You said it, Mr Grasshopper.

675
00:52:41,232 --> 00:52:45,525
Oh, boy. What I wouldn't do
for a cup of coffee.

676
00:52:50,741 --> 00:52:53,659
Cup of joe.

677
00:52:53,744 --> 00:52:57,196
I say, old sport. Came to
relieve you of your duties.

678
00:52:57,290 --> 00:53:01,073
I said I'd steer the peach.
Have to steer the peach.

679
00:53:02,461 --> 00:53:06,329
- Can't quit now.
- Good show, old boy.

680
00:53:10,595 --> 00:53:14,213
Thanks, Mr Grasshopper.

681
00:54:01,355 --> 00:54:04,806
- That music.
- Oh, Sir James! D-Did I disturb you?

682
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:07,390
So sorry.
I-I-I-I'll put this away.

683
00:54:07,485 --> 00:54:09,395
No, no! I like it.

684
00:54:09,488 --> 00:54:13,402
I used to hear it at my aunts'
house before I went to sleep.

685
00:54:13,492 --> 00:54:15,448
That was you, wasn't it?

686
00:54:15,535 --> 00:54:17,611
Or do all grasshoppers play music?

687
00:54:17,704 --> 00:54:21,072
All grasshoppers try.

688
00:54:21,166 --> 00:54:23,124
I'm sure you've heard this.

689
00:54:27,422 --> 00:54:30,091
Ghastly, isn't it? Cricket stuff.

690
00:54:30,174 --> 00:54:34,587
- Music should be the voice of the soul.
- What does that mean?

691
00:54:34,679 --> 00:54:39,306
It means that when I'm happy,
my music sounds like this.

692
00:54:54,198 --> 00:54:57,532
And when I'm sad,
it's like this.

693
00:55:07,879 --> 00:55:12,376
When I was sad, I used to climb
in bed with my mum and dad.

694
00:55:12,468 --> 00:55:15,385
But that was a long time ago.

695
00:55:15,471 --> 00:55:18,591
I'm sure they'd be
very proud of you,James.

696
00:55:18,682 --> 00:55:21,220
I know we are.

697
00:55:31,612 --> 00:55:33,651
<i>Take a little time</i>

698
00:55:33,739 --> 00:55:35,981
<i>Just look at where we are</i>

699
00:55:36,075 --> 00:55:38,317
<i>We've come very, very far</i>

700
00:55:38,411 --> 00:55:40,736
<i>Together</i>

701
00:55:40,830 --> 00:55:42,988
<i>And if I might say so</i>

702
00:55:43,082 --> 00:55:45,656
<i>And if I might say so too</i>

703
00:55:45,752 --> 00:55:48,206
<i>We wouldn't have got anywhere</i>

704
00:55:48,295 --> 00:55:52,755
<i>If it weren't for you, boy</i>

705
00:55:52,841 --> 00:55:57,468
<i>Love is the sweetest thing</i>

706
00:55:57,555 --> 00:56:02,098
<i>Love never comes
just when you think it will</i>

707
00:56:02,184 --> 00:56:06,347
<i>Love is the way we feel for you</i>

708
00:56:06,438 --> 00:56:08,396
<i>We're family</i>

709
00:56:08,483 --> 00:56:10,772
<i>We're family</i>

710
00:56:10,859 --> 00:56:13,149
<i>- We're family
- All of us</i>

711
00:56:13,237 --> 00:56:15,395
<i>And you</i>

712
00:56:23,289 --> 00:56:25,495
<i>Think of where we'd be</i>

713
00:56:25,584 --> 00:56:28,156
<i>- If we were on our own
- We'd be dead.</i>

714
00:56:28,252 --> 00:56:32,499
<i>- You're what holds us all together
- I am?</i>

715
00:56:32,589 --> 00:56:34,749
<i>And if I might say so</i>

716
00:56:34,843 --> 00:56:37,547
<i>And if we might say so too</i>

717
00:56:37,636 --> 00:56:39,879
<i>We never could love anyone</i>

718
00:56:39,972 --> 00:56:43,056
<i>As much as we love you</i>

719
00:56:44,436 --> 00:56:49,144
<i>- Love
- Is the strangest thing</i>

720
00:56:49,232 --> 00:56:51,059
<i>Love</i>

721
00:56:51,150 --> 00:56:53,689
<i>Does exactly what
it wants to do</i>

722
00:56:53,778 --> 00:56:57,859
<i>- Love
- Boy, ya know it's true</i>

723
00:56:57,950 --> 00:56:59,858
<i>We're family</i>

724
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:01,991
<i>We're family</i>

725
00:57:02,078 --> 00:57:06,705
<i>We're family
Me, me, me, me, me and you</i>

726
00:57:08,501 --> 00:57:10,411
<i>Ashes to ashes</i>

727
00:57:10,504 --> 00:57:13,076
<i>And dust to dust</i>

728
00:57:13,172 --> 00:57:18,843
<i>Without you
there'd be no "us''</i>

729
00:57:20,012 --> 00:57:24,425
<i>Love is the sweetest thing</i>

730
00:57:24,517 --> 00:57:28,931
<i>Love does exactly what
it wants to do</i>

731
00:57:29,021 --> 00:57:33,020
<i>Love is the way we feel for you</i>

732
00:57:33,109 --> 00:57:35,103
<i>We're family</i>

733
00:57:35,195 --> 00:57:37,567
<i>We're family</i>

734
00:57:37,656 --> 00:57:41,487
<i>We're family</i>

735
00:57:41,576 --> 00:57:43,285
<i>Me</i>

736
00:57:43,370 --> 00:57:47,119
<i>And you</i>

737
00:57:59,219 --> 00:58:01,508
We'll always be together, won't we?

738
00:58:01,597 --> 00:58:04,431
Kid, you're stuck
with us for life.

739
00:58:10,314 --> 00:58:12,852
Look, everybody. We made it!

740
00:58:12,941 --> 00:58:15,979
- We did?
- New York City.

741
00:58:16,070 --> 00:58:18,108
- Breathtaking!
- Stunning!

742
00:58:18,197 --> 00:58:20,236
- Oh, how glorious!
- Look at the park!

743
00:58:20,324 --> 00:58:22,815
- It's fabulous.
- We have made it!

744
00:58:22,909 --> 00:58:24,819
What a wonderful sight!

745
00:58:24,912 --> 00:58:27,285
There's Lady Liberty.

746
00:58:27,372 --> 00:58:30,124
I can almost smell
the lovely dirt.

747
00:58:30,209 --> 00:58:34,159
- Is it not beautiful?
- The Empire State Building!

748
00:58:34,255 --> 00:58:37,670
See those lights! Wa-hoo!

749
00:58:37,759 --> 00:58:40,593
Yippee! Attaboy, Jimmy!

750
00:58:40,678 --> 00:58:44,461
Good show,James!
The city awaits us.

751
00:58:44,556 --> 00:58:48,885
Now, remember,James. First
impression is very important.

752
00:59:01,531 --> 00:59:04,449
- Oh, no!
- We'll be blown off course!

753
00:59:04,535 --> 00:59:06,943
We'll wind up in Jersey!

754
00:59:12,042 --> 00:59:15,292
- Could it be--
- No. It couldn't be.

755
00:59:16,839 --> 00:59:21,085
- It's the rhino!
- Oh,James. Do something.

756
00:59:25,806 --> 00:59:28,972
Everyone, climb up
into the rigging!

757
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:30,969
Hurry!

758
00:59:33,149 --> 00:59:36,766
James, are you not
coming with us?

759
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:40,228
No! It got
my mum and dad.

760
00:59:40,321 --> 00:59:43,524
It won't get my friends!

761
00:59:43,617 --> 00:59:46,867
Come out and show your face,
you stupid beast!

762
00:59:54,794 --> 00:59:57,332
Good God Almighty!

763
01:00:00,008 --> 01:00:03,840
Remember what
your parents said,James:

764
01:00:03,929 --> 01:00:08,508
"Try looking at it another way.''

765
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:11,933
You're not even a real rhino!

766
01:00:12,019 --> 01:00:16,018
You're just a lot
of smoke and noise!

767
01:00:16,107 --> 01:00:18,479
I'm not afraid of you!

768
01:00:27,202 --> 01:00:33,039
I'm not afraid of you!

769
01:00:44,302 --> 01:00:47,137
James!

770
01:00:47,222 --> 01:00:50,176
No!

771
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:27,047
Miss Spider? Mr Grasshopper?

772
01:01:29,098 --> 01:01:31,671
Hello? Is anyone there?

773
01:02:09,013 --> 01:02:11,053
This isn't right.

774
01:02:11,141 --> 01:02:13,976
Where's the Empire State Building?

775
01:02:36,207 --> 01:02:38,366
What in the--

776
01:02:41,588 --> 01:02:45,371
Officer! There's a boy up there!

777
01:02:47,093 --> 01:02:49,002
What? A boy?

778
01:02:54,350 --> 01:02:57,269
Mabel, we got us a huge,
unidentified object here.

779
01:02:57,353 --> 01:03:00,023
<i>- What's it look like?
- Round, fuzzy.</i>

780
01:03:00,106 --> 01:03:02,679
<i>- It looks sorta like
a giant fruit or something.
- Well, what is it?</i>

781
01:03:02,775 --> 01:03:07,236
I don't know what it is!Just send us
the biggest crane in New York!

782
01:03:24,381 --> 01:03:27,631
Please, sir. How do I get
to the Empire State Building?

783
01:03:27,718 --> 01:03:30,125
You're on top of it, kid.

784
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:32,177
We made it!

785
01:03:35,933 --> 01:03:38,176
Well, I made it.

786
01:03:42,232 --> 01:03:44,141
Hang on.

787
01:03:50,575 --> 01:03:52,566
Have you seen
any big bugs tonight?

788
01:03:52,658 --> 01:03:54,984
Big bugs? How big?

789
01:04:01,085 --> 01:04:03,657
I hope they're all right.

790
01:04:21,939 --> 01:04:23,849
Let's go. Let's go.
Stay back. Stay back.

791
01:04:31,281 --> 01:04:33,855
Don't worry, kid.
You'll be all right.

792
01:04:33,951 --> 01:04:36,240
Come on, sonny.
Don't be afraid, now. I got ya.

793
01:04:37,121 --> 01:04:39,528
Stay away from the fruit!

794
01:04:39,624 --> 01:04:42,624
- Who's that? Hey!
- What is this thing?

795
01:04:42,709 --> 01:04:44,335
- Where you from?
- Why you here?
- Who?
- What?

796
01:04:44,420 --> 01:04:47,041
- Where?
- When?
- Hold your fire, fellas!

797
01:04:47,130 --> 01:04:49,704
He's just a kid, for Pete's sake.
Here. I got you now.

798
01:04:51,135 --> 01:04:54,420
It's okay, little guy.
Nobody's going to hurt ya.

799
01:04:54,513 --> 01:04:56,636
Move back for them.

800
01:05:26,170 --> 01:05:28,329
No.

801
01:05:45,690 --> 01:05:47,766
Hello,

802
01:05:47,859 --> 01:05:51,773
little angel.

803
01:05:51,863 --> 01:05:55,694
So kind of you to look after
our little lost lamb.

804
01:05:57,535 --> 01:06:00,952
- Who are you?
- We are the boy's legal guardians.

805
01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:03,956
And we've missed him so much.

806
01:06:04,041 --> 01:06:05,952
So we'll just take him home now.

807
01:06:06,043 --> 01:06:08,879
And the peach, of course.
We're taking that as well.

808
01:06:08,963 --> 01:06:11,537
Well, wait a minute.
Wait, wait, wait. Back up.

809
01:06:11,633 --> 01:06:15,297
You mean to tell me that
this thing is a peach?

810
01:06:15,386 --> 01:06:18,637
- It's not " a peach.'' It's our peach.
- Our peach.

811
01:06:18,723 --> 01:06:20,681
- Show him, Spongy.
- Yes.

812
01:06:31,235 --> 01:06:33,276
-Looks like it's their peach, all right.
-Yes.

813
01:06:33,363 --> 01:06:37,028
- Yes, and we're very proud of it.
- We're going to be in the record books.

814
01:06:37,116 --> 01:06:40,154
It's not their peach.
The old man gave the green things to me.

815
01:06:40,244 --> 01:06:44,160
- That's what made it grow.
- How dare you disagree with us!

816
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:50,003
Patience, sister.
Remember his condition.

817
01:06:50,088 --> 01:06:52,496
- His condition?
- He's a chronic liar.

818
01:06:52,591 --> 01:06:55,508
Sad, really.
He needs his treatment.

819
01:06:55,594 --> 01:06:58,050
Well, that's why we're here;
to bring him home.

820
01:06:58,139 --> 01:07:01,507
So you come here with us,
eh, lovey!

821
01:07:03,727 --> 01:07:05,850
I'm not the one who's lying.
They are!

822
01:07:05,938 --> 01:07:10,599
As you can see, Officer, it is urgent
that you release him to us immediately.

823
01:07:10,692 --> 01:07:12,685
Let the boy speak!

824
01:07:12,778 --> 01:07:15,021
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Let the boy speak!

825
01:07:17,407 --> 01:07:21,275
All right! All right! All right!
Let's get to the bottom of this.

826
01:07:21,369 --> 01:07:24,455
This thing is a peach.

827
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:26,532
All right. I'll buy that.

828
01:07:26,625 --> 01:07:29,377
Now, does somebody want
to tell me how it got here?

829
01:07:29,462 --> 01:07:31,668
We attached it
to a hundred seagulls.

830
01:07:31,756 --> 01:07:34,211
Seagulls?

831
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:35,758
That's what happened!

832
01:07:35,843 --> 01:07:39,461
Me and Miss Spider and the centipede
and the old green grasshopper.

833
01:07:39,555 --> 01:07:42,391
I think he's gone mad.

834
01:07:42,475 --> 01:07:45,012
This is all something he dreamed up.

835
01:07:47,021 --> 01:07:52,477
Well, maybe it started that way,
as a dream, but doesn't everything?

836
01:07:52,568 --> 01:07:56,898
Those buildings, these lights,
this whole city!

837
01:07:56,989 --> 01:08:01,117
Somebody had to dream about it first,
and maybe that's what I did.

838
01:08:01,201 --> 01:08:03,990
I dreamed about coming here,
but then I did it.

839
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:07,080
- The poor boy needs his medicine.
- Yes.

840
01:08:07,167 --> 01:08:10,285
- So we'll just take him--
- And the peach.

841
01:08:10,378 --> 01:08:13,877
back to our cosy, little house
on the hill.

842
01:08:13,965 --> 01:08:16,752
Come along.
You're going home with us.

843
01:08:16,842 --> 01:08:18,882
No, I'm not.

844
01:08:20,471 --> 01:08:21,882
What did you say?

845
01:08:21,973 --> 01:08:26,599
I said, "No, I'm not!''

846
01:08:26,686 --> 01:08:30,766
I hate that house and that cold room
and how I was always hungry.

847
01:08:30,857 --> 01:08:32,766
All right! That's enough!

848
01:08:32,859 --> 01:08:37,355
- And how you beat me!
- He's lying!

849
01:08:37,447 --> 01:08:40,282
- And told me I was nothing!
- Shut up!
- Shut up!

850
01:08:40,367 --> 01:08:43,035
- Shut up!
- No! Not this time.

851
01:08:44,871 --> 01:08:47,540
I flew the giant peach
across the ocean.

852
01:08:47,623 --> 01:08:51,207
I landed on top of the
tallest building in the world.

853
01:08:51,295 --> 01:08:54,877
I made it! I'm not the one
who's nothing. You are!

854
01:08:54,964 --> 01:08:59,093
And I'm never going back with you!
Not me, and not the peach.

855
01:08:59,177 --> 01:09:01,715
How dare you speak to us this way?

856
01:09:13,817 --> 01:09:15,940
James! Up here!

857
01:09:17,028 --> 01:09:20,029
Hello! We're here!

858
01:09:20,114 --> 01:09:23,069
- Hey, buddy!
- What are they?

859
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:26,944
- Young James.
- Hey,Jimmy!

860
01:09:27,038 --> 01:09:31,286
- Bugs!
- Need a little help down there?

861
01:09:31,377 --> 01:09:33,748
Giant bugs!

862
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:37,834
Hey, you old biddies!

863
01:09:37,923 --> 01:09:40,047
- Help us!
- Whoo-ee! Here we are, dear.

864
01:09:40,135 --> 01:09:42,175
Hello,James!

865
01:09:42,262 --> 01:09:44,254
I told you they were real.

866
01:09:44,348 --> 01:09:48,475
- Hello, old boy.
- Requesting clearance to land.

867
01:09:56,610 --> 01:09:58,853
Miss Spider, throw me a string.

868
01:10:06,370 --> 01:10:08,279
Okay. Pull them up.

869
01:10:08,373 --> 01:10:10,281
Help!

870
01:10:12,585 --> 01:10:14,791
Where are we going?

871
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:19,798
- Spin them around.
- You little--

872
01:10:22,553 --> 01:10:24,675
Wrap them tightly!

873
01:10:31,562 --> 01:10:35,061
Tighter! Tighter!

874
01:10:35,149 --> 01:10:37,438
Well, I'll be a--

875
01:10:37,527 --> 01:10:39,483
The kid was tellin' the truth.

876
01:10:42,156 --> 01:10:45,904
Get those two creeps outta here!

877
01:10:56,211 --> 01:10:58,703
Stop the presses!
I got a new front page!

878
01:10:58,799 --> 01:11:01,123
"Big Bugs In The Big Apple.''

879
01:11:01,217 --> 01:11:05,084
In big, bold print: " A Little
Lindy Flies Giant Peach.''

880
01:11:05,179 --> 01:11:08,963
"Half-Pint Hero
And His Peach-Pit Pals.''

881
01:11:11,561 --> 01:11:14,561
Everyone, these are my friends;

882
01:11:14,646 --> 01:11:16,605
the ones I've been telling you about.

883
01:11:16,691 --> 01:11:18,979
- Mr Centipede.
- Hi.

884
01:11:19,067 --> 01:11:21,108
- Old green grasshopper.
- My pleasure.

885
01:11:21,196 --> 01:11:24,280
- Earthworm. Mrs Ladybug.
- Charmed.

886
01:11:24,365 --> 01:11:27,485
Miss Spider. And the glow-worm.

887
01:11:27,577 --> 01:11:29,701
God bless the colonies.

888
01:11:30,246 --> 01:11:34,790
- Could we eat some of your peach?
- It won't keep forever.

889
01:11:34,876 --> 01:11:36,785
Go ahead.

890
01:11:46,721 --> 01:11:49,295
Hey! What was your name?

891
01:11:49,390 --> 01:11:51,347
It's James.

892
01:11:59,608 --> 01:12:03,772
They ate that peach
all the way down to the pit...

893
01:12:05,782 --> 01:12:09,649
and set it up in Central Park
as a permanent home.

894
01:12:11,412 --> 01:12:13,986
And James Henry Trotter,

895
01:12:14,082 --> 01:12:17,664
who once was the saddest and loneliest
little boy you could find,

896
01:12:17,752 --> 01:12:20,836
now had a loving new family...

897
01:12:20,921 --> 01:12:23,460
and all the friends in the world.

898
01:12:23,549 --> 01:12:26,219
James, dinner is ready.

899
01:12:26,303 --> 01:12:28,675
All right. Nearly finished.

900
01:12:33,101 --> 01:12:37,016
And since James's visitors
begged him again and again...

901
01:12:37,106 --> 01:12:40,390
to hear the story of his
adventure with the giant peach,

902
01:12:40,483 --> 01:12:43,320
he wished for a way
to share it with everyone.

903
01:12:45,363 --> 01:12:50,109
And that is exactly
what you have just seen.

904
01:13:05,510 --> 01:13:09,458
<i>Once upon a time
there was a vulture and a hog</i>

905
01:13:09,554 --> 01:13:12,888
<i>Livin' in a house
up on a hill</i>

906
01:13:12,975 --> 01:13:17,387
<i>Had this little boy who lived with them
They worked him like a dog</i>

907
01:13:17,479 --> 01:13:20,764
<i>With any luck
they'd have him up there still</i>

908
01:13:20,857 --> 01:13:24,901
<i>'Long came a magic man
with a magic bag</i>

909
01:13:24,986 --> 01:13:28,901
<i>Full of nasty little
green things in a funky old rag</i>

910
01:13:28,990 --> 01:13:32,906
<i>He said, Boy, you may not know it
but this here's salvation you see</i>

911
01:13:32,995 --> 01:13:35,746
<i>Son, you're going down in history</i>

912
01:13:39,710 --> 01:13:41,999
<i>Good news is blowin' in your window</i>

913
01:13:43,714 --> 01:13:46,335
<i>Good news is knockin' on your door</i>

914
01:13:47,719 --> 01:13:50,209
<i>Good news is comin' 'round the corner</i>

915
01:13:51,763 --> 01:13:54,005
<i>Good news is rollin' 'round your floor</i>

916
01:13:55,726 --> 01:13:59,677
<i>Where can all my troubles be</i>

917
01:13:59,773 --> 01:14:03,687
<i>Must be good news chasin' me</i>

918
01:14:03,776 --> 01:14:07,109
<i>Good enough to set everybody free</i>

919
01:14:07,196 --> 01:14:11,360
<i>Good news, good news, good news</i>

920
01:14:11,450 --> 01:14:13,195
<i>Good news</i>

921
01:14:13,286 --> 01:14:17,366
<i>There were bugs in the garden
Didn't have a clue</i>

922
01:14:17,457 --> 01:14:21,157
<i>But every day
their life was on the line</i>

923
01:14:21,252 --> 01:14:25,296
<i>They wanted to get out of there
but they didn't know what to do</i>

924
01:14:25,381 --> 01:14:28,465
<i>Their little brains
was workin' overtime</i>

925
01:14:28,550 --> 01:14:33,712
<i>- Well
- That all changed one sunny day</i>

926
01:14:33,807 --> 01:14:37,341
<i>That little boy dropped by to say</i>

927
01:14:37,434 --> 01:14:40,971
<i>If we all work together
we'll make out okay</i>

928
01:14:41,064 --> 01:14:45,275
<i>- We will
