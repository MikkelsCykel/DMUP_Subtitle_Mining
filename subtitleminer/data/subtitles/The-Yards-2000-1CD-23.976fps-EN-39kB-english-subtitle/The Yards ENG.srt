1
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:55,824
1, 2, 1, 2, 3.

2
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:02,414
Go!Go!Go!

3
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:05,000
Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go!

4
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,502
Aah!

5
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,511
Watch out, watch out,
it's hot, it's hot.

6
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:17,304
Thank you,
honey.

7
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:18,597
All right.

8
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,015
Ok.

9
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,350
No, no, no, no.

10
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:22,351
Come on.

11
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:23,769
We have to wait for Leo.

12
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,312
Get out of here,
Bernard.

13
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:26,855
We're waiting
for your cousin.

14
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:28,023
I'm hungry.

15
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,650
I'll tell ya,
yeah, he's good-lookin'.

16
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:32,152
He's real good-lookin'.
You're gonna like him.

17
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:33,445
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

18
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:34,488
You think so?

19
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,823
I know so.
I know these kind of things.

20
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:38,450
Trust me.
I'm blessed with a gift.

21
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:39,743
Careful.
It's real hot.

22
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:40,953
I got it, I got it.

23
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:42,454
Val, this all
looks wonderful.

24
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:43,455
Yeah.

25
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:45,457
Let's try and make
a little room here.

26
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,376
What about your husband,
is he coming?

27
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,086
Oh, no.
Frank can't come, honey.

28
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,755
I meant to tell you.
He has to work,

29
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:54,174
but he's gonna meet Leo
tomorrow at the interview.

30
00:02:54,226 --> 00:02:56,625
Ok. Well...

31
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:59,263
At least
Bernard's eating.

32
00:03:02,975 --> 00:03:03,976
Hey, sweetie.

33
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,270
- How you doin'?
- Good.

34
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:07,312
- Hmm?
- Yeah.

35
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:08,689
Erica, you know Belvee?
Belva.

36
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:09,690
Belva.. Belva.

37
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:10,691
Belva. Nice.

38
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:13,193
Hey.

39
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:15,487
I was telling her about
your cousin, about Leo.

40
00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:16,905
I want her to meet him.

41
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:17,906
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

42
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:53,859
Hey. Hey, every body.
He's here.

43
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:54,943
Yay!

44
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:56,111
Hey!

45
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:58,113
Hey, allright!

46
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:05,412
Hey, Ma.

47
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:06,872
How you doin'? Good?

48
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:09,374
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

49
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:12,920
You look terrific.

50
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:15,130
Oh, thanks. You, too.

51
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,057
I'm so glad you're home.

52
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,350
Me, too.

53
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,853
Hey!

54
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:31,146
Hey, Leo!

55
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:32,689
Leo the lion!

56
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:36,068
We all came to see you,
buddy. How you doin'?

57
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:37,236
I'm all right.

58
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,404
I love ya, man.

59
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,241
Welcome home.

60
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,284
Thanks.
It's good to see you.

61
00:04:44,336 --> 00:04:45,233
You, too.

62
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,411
- How you doin'?
- Real good.

63
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:47,319
Leo, welcome home.

64
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:48,288
Hey,
what's up, Dante?

65
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:49,414
Good to see you.

66
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,458
What's up, Todd?

67
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,293
- What's up, Leo?
- Neil.

68
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:55,879
You guys all look like
you're doin' really good.

69
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:57,172
Don't worry about it.

70
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:00,425
It's gonna be comin'
your way soon enough.

71
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,469
Hey, um,
I want you to meet Belva.

72
00:05:02,521 --> 00:05:04,471
Belva, this is Leo.
This is Leo.

73
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:05,514
Hi.

74
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:07,099
Belva's a dancer.

75
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:08,392
Hi.

76
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:09,810
Come on. We've
got so much food.

77
00:05:09,862 --> 00:05:11,520
Everybody,
let's eat.

78
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:14,606
Just dig in.
Just help yourselves.

79
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:17,599
Mr. Handler.

80
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:20,195
We need to go over
a few things.

81
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:21,822
Where can we talk?

82
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,200
I guess
in the bedroom.

83
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,535
Come on.

84
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,497
My records show

85
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:32,666
that you were released
at, uh...

86
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,751
4:00 this afternoon.

87
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,420
That's right.

88
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:38,130
You're supposed to make
an arrival report.

89
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:39,631
Well,
nobody told me that.

90
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,133
I thought
I had 24 hours.

91
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:42,415
OK, well, in the future,

92
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:44,553
you should know that
you're required to report

93
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,013
with due diligence.

94
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:48,432
Now, your profile says

95
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,017
you had some problems.

96
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:52,978
I see here that you served
16 months for auto theft.

97
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,438
So your parole status

98
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,648
has you on
intensive supervision.

99
00:05:56,732 --> 00:05:58,317
I'll have access
to your bank records,

100
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:00,235
your W-2s, your pay stubs.

101
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:02,946
That's to keep
track of your cash flow.

102
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,365
Now, what about employment?
You know what you're gonna do?

103
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:07,242
Yeah, I think
I got something.

104
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:08,452
What's that?

105
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,954
Well, my aunt's new husband
has his own business.

106
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:13,040
You know, he's very,
very important.

107
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:15,042
I'm supposed to go and
interview with him tomorrow.

108
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:16,251
A couple of
my friends out there,

109
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:17,753
they've been
workin' for him, too.

110
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:18,754
Mm-hmm.

111
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,340
What about
your counseling?

112
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:25,052
You know, I just-I don't
wanna cause no problems.

113
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:27,054
I just wanna become
a productive person again,

114
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:29,473
you know, in society.

115
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:36,480
So, what'd you think?

116
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:39,024
He looks good, right?
He looks good.

117
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:42,986
Yeah. I never knew
him from before.

118
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:44,571
Yeah, that's-
I mean, that's the point.

119
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:46,698
I don't-
I have nothin' to go by.

120
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:51,286
Hey.

121
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:54,998
Every thing OK?

122
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:56,208
Leo.. Yeah.

123
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,210
How you doin'? How come
you're not out there?

124
00:06:58,252 --> 00:07:00,128
'Cause Willie's talkin'
with every body,

125
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:03,799
and I just... just wanted
to get away for a second.

126
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:05,551
You and him
still OK together?

127
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:06,718
Yeah.

128
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,097
We're thinking about
maybe settling down...

129
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:14,226
but he's so busy
with work right now, you know.

130
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:16,728
You know, I was really sorry
to hear about your father.

131
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,858
He was a good man.

132
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:27,239
Maybe we should
go back out there.

133
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:29,575
Erica.

134
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:32,452
What about your new
father, you like him?

135
00:07:32,504 --> 00:07:35,038
He's all right.

136
00:07:39,585 --> 00:07:41,962
Did you get my letters?

137
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:45,413
Whoa!

138
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:49,386
They must've forgot
to switch the fuse box.

139
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:51,972
OK, let's check out
the radio...

140
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:56,602
There you are.

141
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:57,895
Hi, Ma.

142
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:59,938
Looks like
there's a blackout, huh?

143
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,316
Yeah.

144
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:04,651
Erica, why don't you
let your cousin be?

145
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:06,987
See if they need
anything out there.

146
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:14,870
Excuse me, Aunt Kitty?

147
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:16,121
Yeah.

148
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:17,915
I just wanted
to thank you

149
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:19,416
and your husband for
the meeting tomorrow.

150
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,615
I really
appreciate that.

151
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:23,712
Well, you know I'd do
anything for your mother.

152
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:31,094
She's not
doing too well.

153
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:33,222
You should know that.

154
00:08:33,305 --> 00:08:35,682
Her heart
is getting weaker.

155
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:45,817
Here he is.

156
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:46,985
Leo!

157
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:47,684
Hey, Leo!

158
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:48,695
What's up?
What's up?

159
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,739
What's up, buddy? Aah!

160
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:53,116
- How you doin', all right?
- Yeah, good.

161
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:54,826
Did you get a beer
or something?

162
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:55,827
No. I'm all right.

163
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:56,828
All right.

164
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,622
Hey, I just wanted
to tell you...

165
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:00,833
me and the guys really
appreciate what you did.

166
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,918
Didn't say nothing
to the cops about us.

167
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:05,921
I would never fold
on you. You know that.

168
00:09:05,963 --> 00:09:07,923
Look, I want you
to come work with us.

169
00:09:07,965 --> 00:09:09,299
So tomorrow
when you see Frank,

170
00:09:09,351 --> 00:09:10,634
you tell him that,
all right?

171
00:09:10,926 --> 00:09:12,135
- All right.
- OK, good.

172
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:13,929
Come have a beer with us,
OK, Leo?

173
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:15,222
Hey, you've had enough
for every body.

174
00:09:15,264 --> 00:09:16,223
No.

175
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:17,349
Leo.

176
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:18,934
We're all gonna go
to the club this weekend.

177
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,143
You know, like we used to.
All right?

178
00:09:20,195 --> 00:09:21,353
Oh,
that sounds excellent.

179
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:22,938
Be good.

180
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:23,939
Hey.

181
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,357
Hey, Leo,
what's going on?

182
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:26,859
What's up, buddy?
You don't say hi?

183
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:27,943
You look good.

184
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:29,528
Excuse me, everyone.

185
00:09:30,696 --> 00:09:32,739
Every one!

186
00:09:32,865 --> 00:09:36,869
Um, I just want to say
that I am very happy

187
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,745
to have you all here.

188
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:41,540
And...

189
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:43,667
the last few years
have been...

190
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:47,880
Well,
sometimes not so easy,

191
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:50,966
but that's all over now.

192
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,968
And so from now on,

193
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:56,180
we're gonna have nothing
but good times.

194
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:58,182
That's all I wanted to say.

195
00:09:58,223 --> 00:09:59,183
Hear, hear.

196
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:00,517
Absolutely.

197
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:04,730
All right.

198
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:07,316
Let's have some coffee,
if I can find the pot.

199
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:08,317
Yeah!

200
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,237
Ma...

201
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:16,408
I just-I just
wanted to tell you

202
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,744
that I'm sorry...

203
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,996
for every thing.

204
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:25,792
Don't worry about it.

205
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:29,129
Go on, be with your friends.
Have a good time.

206
00:10:33,926 --> 00:10:35,844
What's up, Todd?

207
00:10:35,928 --> 00:10:37,429
Leo, sit down.
Talk to us.

208
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:38,931
How you doin'?

209
00:11:29,273 --> 00:11:31,984
Bye, Denise.
My best to your mother.

210
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:39,992
Send him in, Denise.

211
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:44,121
Leo.

212
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:45,706
Nice
to finally meet you.

213
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:47,833
It's nice
to meet you, too.

214
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,376
Sorry
you had to wait.

215
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:50,794
Sit down.

216
00:11:50,878 --> 00:11:52,004
All right. Thanks.

217
00:11:54,006 --> 00:11:56,300
So, uh...

218
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:58,010
how's your mother?

219
00:11:58,093 --> 00:12:01,305
She's OK. She's try in',
you know, she's battlin'.

220
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:04,516
We had a lot of nice
conversations about you.

221
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,851
She's a wonderful woman.

222
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:07,394
I mean, supporting you
by herself

223
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,897
for all those years
took a lot of guts.

224
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:12,399
I know.

225
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:14,902
And I'm gonna do every thing
I can to make it up to her.

226
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,031
My wife and I, we, uh,
tried to help her out,

227
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:22,034
but, uh...
she wouldn't take it.

228
00:12:22,117 --> 00:12:23,577
I- I admire that.

229
00:12:23,619 --> 00:12:25,037
I know
the last couple of years

230
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,039
have been pretty
hard on her.

231
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:28,373
You got yourself
in some trouble,

232
00:12:28,457 --> 00:12:29,917
uh, you stole
a couple of cars

233
00:12:30,042 --> 00:12:30,959
or something.

234
00:12:31,043 --> 00:12:32,127
Yeah.

235
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,129
You did
a little time, huh?

236
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:37,633
I know it's pretty
tough in there, uh...

237
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:39,593
but the business world
ain't that much different.

238
00:12:39,635 --> 00:12:41,178
I mean, sometimes
you gotta have eyes

239
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,555
in the back of
your fucking head.

240
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:46,558
So, uh, you know
what we do here?

241
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,228
If it's on a train, if it's
on a New York subway,

242
00:12:49,353 --> 00:12:51,271
we make it or we fix it.

243
00:12:51,355 --> 00:12:54,942
Uh... couplers, brakes,
transformers, every thing.

244
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:56,735
You got any experience
with stuff like that?

245
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,070
I could learn.

246
00:12:58,153 --> 00:13:00,572
Learn... good.
There's some, uh,

247
00:13:00,656 --> 00:13:03,367
very good training programs
out there for machinists,

248
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,577
and I could make a call.

249
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:10,666
Well, I really need to support
me and my mother right now.

250
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:13,293
How long would
a program like that take?

251
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:16,171
Good machinist?
Uh... couple years.

252
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,382
But, uh, you'd
have a good union job

253
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:20,217
waitin' for you here
when you were through.

254
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,470
400, 500 a week, uh...
and, uh...

255
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:26,379
I could help you along
a little till you graduate.

256
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:29,726
What about Willie? I mean,
I know he didn't go to school,

257
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:32,395
And he thought that maybe
I could work with him.

258
00:13:32,447 --> 00:13:34,773
I don't think that's
such a good idea for you.

259
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:37,025
Well, what does he do?

260
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:39,528
He- He deals with
suppliers mostly. Uh...

261
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:40,904
ah, I don't know.

262
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:44,992
I really think that you
should look into a program.

263
00:13:45,117 --> 00:13:47,619
I'd- I'd have
to think about that.

264
00:13:47,703 --> 00:13:49,288
All right.

265
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:53,417
Uh, look,
why don't, uh...

266
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,627
why don't you and
your mother come over

267
00:13:55,711 --> 00:13:56,753
To the house
Saturday night

268
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:58,839
for a little dinner?

269
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:00,465
The whole family
will be there.

270
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:01,800
It'll be very nice.

271
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:04,511
OK.

272
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:06,346
Leo.

273
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:09,516
Thanks for comin'

274
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:10,809
and, look, uh...

275
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:12,144
you're a nephew now,

276
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:14,646
and I'd really like
to help you.

277
00:14:53,227 --> 00:14:54,269

283
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:28,887
Hey, Willie,
what's up, man?

284
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:29,878
Como esta, bien?

285
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,139
Hey, this is my friend Leo.
Leo, this is Ricky.

286
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:32,641
We went to Francis Lewis
together.

287
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:33,809
Cool.

288
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:35,310
Yo, thanks for hooking me up
with Russell, man.

289
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:36,520
He put in my whole system
for me.

290
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:37,813
I like the way
it sounds, man.

291
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:38,814
I mean,
I like what he did.

292
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:40,023
I told you.
He's the best.

293
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:41,108
You did.
He's a good worker.

294
00:15:41,233 --> 00:15:42,317
So what's up?
What do you want?

295
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:43,569
Uh,
give me 2 Millers,

296
00:15:43,652 --> 00:15:45,237
uh, Jim Beam, and, uh,
some rum and Coke

297
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,030
for them out there.
Put it on my tab.

298
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:48,115
Yeah.

299
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,742
&Sempre assim&

300
00:15:50,826 --> 00:15:55,289
Willie, I don't know
what the fuck I'm gonna do.

301
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:57,624
About what? Frank?

302
00:15:57,749 --> 00:15:59,126
Yeah.

303
00:15:59,251 --> 00:16:01,378
You don't gotta
go back to school.

304
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,338
Look, he tried that same shit
with me when I started.

305
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:06,925
I- I convinced him,
let me work with the suits.

306
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,917
Well,
how did you do that?

307
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:12,055
He let me hang out with them,
and I earned their respect.

308
00:16:12,264 --> 00:16:13,891
You're throwin' a lot
of fuckin' money around.

309
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:15,642
What is it you do
for this guy?

310
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:19,188
Look, why don't you
come down with me tomorrow

311
00:16:19,271 --> 00:16:20,647
and see for yourself?

312
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:22,441
All right? If you like it,
we'll talk to Frank about it.

313
00:16:22,566 --> 00:16:24,276
All right,
I'm just asking,

314
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:25,652
'cause you know I can't
get into no trouble.

315
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:26,737
You know that.

316
00:16:26,862 --> 00:16:28,071
Nah,
you won't get into trouble.

317
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:29,364
I won't let you
get into trouble.

318
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:30,657
Look, Frank's a great man.

319
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:33,076
We got a real chance
with him.

320
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,786
You know my mother spent
her whole fuckin' life

321
00:16:34,912 --> 00:16:36,580
on handouts and shit.

322
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,790
Now I got fuckin' money
in my pocket.

323
00:16:38,874 --> 00:16:40,000
The sky's the limit.

324
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:43,086
Yeah, but you was always
good with people, you know.

325
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,130
I'm not too good
with words.

326
00:16:46,632 --> 00:16:48,634
Hey, you're
my best friend.

327
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:50,427
I'm gonna look out for you.
I'll get you in.

328
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:53,180
Yeah, I know, I just
hope it works out,

329
00:16:53,305 --> 00:16:55,224
'cause I would like that
a lot, you know?

330
00:16:55,307 --> 00:16:56,975
I want to work with you.

331
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,393
Great, next week.

332
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:00,187
So, what'd you think
about Belva?

333
00:17:00,312 --> 00:17:02,731
Aw, she's good from far
but far from good, you know?

334
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,201
Samba, samba, samba&

Raise your hands.

359
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:48,712
Empty your pockets.

360
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,593
OK,
you're all right. Go ahead.

361
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:55,928
Thanks, Glenn.

362
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:57,752
All right, Willie.
Come on.

363
00:18:57,804 --> 00:18:59,932
You got a lot of fuckin'
security here, will.

364
00:19:00,265 --> 00:19:02,309
Is it all right that I'm
coming down here with you?

365
00:19:02,434 --> 00:19:05,312
Yeah, yeah, you're fine.
They all know me here.

366
00:19:05,354 --> 00:19:07,105
So, what is this place?

367
00:19:07,231 --> 00:19:08,941
This is Borough Hall.

368
00:19:09,066 --> 00:19:11,985
The train businesses
live and die here.

369
00:19:12,027 --> 00:19:13,529
Today we're
going after contracts

370
00:19:13,654 --> 00:19:14,519
worth $14 million.

371
00:19:14,571 --> 00:19:16,615
Now, it's gonna be
a fuckin' fight,

372
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,743
'cause all our rivals
are gonna be here.

373
00:19:19,827 --> 00:19:21,161
Right now,
our main competition

374
00:19:21,245 --> 00:19:23,028
is with
the Weltech Corporation.

375
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,749
It's run by Manny Sequiera
and Hector Gallardo.

376
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:27,459
They're a minority company,

377
00:19:27,543 --> 00:19:30,045
so they're guaranteed
to get 10% of the business.

378
00:19:30,097 --> 00:19:31,839
Frank says Sequiera
paid off 2 councilmen

379
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:33,757
to get that deal.

380
00:19:33,841 --> 00:19:36,552
Paul Lazzarides
works right under Frank.

381
00:19:36,677 --> 00:19:39,638
He makes our presentations
to the transit authority.

382
00:19:39,763 --> 00:19:42,558
At the head of the authority
is Al Granada.

383
00:19:42,683 --> 00:19:44,893
And my job is to do whatever
I can to keep him happy

384
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:47,563
so that he'll keep
sendin' the work our way.

385
00:19:47,688 --> 00:19:49,606
Do I look OK?
I mean,

386
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:51,567
I don't wanna call
no attention to myself.

387
00:19:51,692 --> 00:19:53,652
You look great.
Come on, let's go in.

388
00:19:56,321 --> 00:19:59,700
We now come up
on order 4-2-3-9-9,

389
00:19:59,783 --> 00:20:02,119
regarding the replacement
of the train rectifiers

390
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:04,997
on the Queens
and Bronx lines.

391
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,624
After careful review,

392
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:10,502
weighing both price
and performance ratings,

393
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:12,880
the committee has decided
to award this contract

394
00:20:13,005 --> 00:20:15,716
to the Electric Rail
Corporation of Maspeth.

395
00:20:15,841 --> 00:20:17,509
Make a note of that.

396
00:20:18,594 --> 00:20:21,889
Next, order 4-6-9-6-4.

397
00:20:22,014 --> 00:20:24,892
It's for 230 couplers,
all for the subway-

398
00:20:25,017 --> 00:20:26,018
Mr. Supervisor,
please.

399
00:20:26,143 --> 00:20:27,603
Hector, let me finish
reading the decisions.

400
00:20:27,728 --> 00:20:29,438
Look, that contract
is part of our guarantee.

401
00:20:29,563 --> 00:20:30,814
I'm sorry,
you're wrong.

402
00:20:30,898 --> 00:20:32,608
But we been
getting the rectifiers,

403
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:33,817
and that's the deal.

404
00:20:33,901 --> 00:20:35,527
Hector,
let me finish, please.

405
00:20:35,611 --> 00:20:36,695
They know it.

406
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:37,905
The deal
for minority quotas

407
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,114
is 10% of the business.

408
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:40,824
Now, which 10%
is up to us.

409
00:20:40,908 --> 00:20:42,034
But I'll tell you
one thing:

410
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:43,202
if it was up to me,

411
00:20:43,327 --> 00:20:44,411
Weltech wouldn't be
gettin' anything,

412
00:20:44,536 --> 00:20:45,496
because
your failure rates

413
00:20:45,621 --> 00:20:46,705
have been going
through the roof.

414
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:47,956
That's 'cause of them.

415
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:49,541
Hector,
please, let me finish.

416
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:50,834
But they're trying
to put us out of business,

417
00:20:50,918 --> 00:20:52,336
and you're a part of it.

418
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:54,379
We wanna make a protest
with the inspector general.

419
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:56,121
Look, there have been
several investigations

420
00:20:56,173 --> 00:20:58,884
into the allegations made
by the people at Weltech.

421
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:00,761
And we have been
repeatedly cleared

422
00:21:00,886 --> 00:21:02,137
of any wrongdoing.

423
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:03,347
They know this,

424
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,640
but they continue
to persist

425
00:21:04,765 --> 00:21:07,476
with these outrageous
accusations.

426
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:09,561
And I think they
owe us an apology.

427
00:21:09,645 --> 00:21:10,854
I owe you an apology?

428
00:21:10,938 --> 00:21:12,147
Yes.

429
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:14,233
Let's get on
with the meeting.

430
00:21:14,358 --> 00:21:15,442
Both of you.

431
00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:17,069
We got business
to transact.

432
00:21:17,194 --> 00:21:18,987
I'm gonna knock you right
into the middle of next week.

433
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:20,280
Let's go, oldman!

434
00:21:20,405 --> 00:21:21,657
Hey, what do you
think I'm doing?

435
00:21:21,782 --> 00:21:23,909
Running some kind of
3- ring circus over here?

436
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:25,244
Come on.

437
00:21:25,369 --> 00:21:27,287
Hey, Gutierrez.

438
00:21:27,371 --> 00:21:29,581
I want to talk to you.

439
00:21:29,665 --> 00:21:31,667
I've got nothing to say, Hector.

440
00:21:31,917 --> 00:21:35,003
Hey, I'm your friend, man.

441
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,924
I know what you're doing.

442
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:42,177
I don't know what you're talking about.

443
00:21:42,302 --> 00:21:43,762
Why don't you
come work for us

444
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:45,472
instead of
those cabrones?

445
00:21:45,597 --> 00:21:48,392
Don't waste my time.

446
00:21:48,475 --> 00:21:50,383
Hey.

447
00:21:50,435 --> 00:21:53,397
You're never gonna be
as white as those guys.

448
00:21:56,233 --> 00:21:57,317
Let's go.

449
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,021
Who's this?

450
00:22:34,146 --> 00:22:36,023
That's Leo.

451
00:22:36,064 --> 00:22:37,357
You'll get to know him.

452
00:22:37,482 --> 00:22:39,151
I'm not in the mood

453
00:22:39,234 --> 00:22:42,487
to make any
new friends today.

454
00:22:42,571 --> 00:22:43,822
It'll be all right.

455
00:22:45,699 --> 00:22:46,658
Who's that?

456
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:48,160
That's Frank's nephew.

457
00:22:48,243 --> 00:22:49,453
Did he do time?

458
00:22:49,536 --> 00:22:51,830
Yeah, just for a little bit,
you know?

459
00:22:51,955 --> 00:22:52,956
Yeah.

460
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,666
Don't worry.
He's a good kid.

461
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:55,834
Got the money?

462
00:23:47,845 --> 00:23:49,388
Say hello
to your uncle for me.

463
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:52,391
See you around, Willie.

464
00:23:52,516 --> 00:23:54,726
All right,
take it easy.

465
00:23:54,852 --> 00:23:56,812
What the fuck
was that, Will?

466
00:23:59,231 --> 00:24:02,317
Nothin'.
He's just, uh...

467
00:24:02,442 --> 00:24:04,736
he's very
worried about wires.

468
00:24:06,572 --> 00:24:09,741
Either that,
or he's got a thing for me.

469
00:24:09,825 --> 00:24:13,912
It seems pretty
fuckin' weird to me.

470
00:24:14,037 --> 00:24:15,622
Does he get a cut
of every thing?

471
00:24:15,747 --> 00:24:17,875
Listen to you.
Don't worry about it.

472
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:19,751
He's a city official.

473
00:24:19,835 --> 00:24:21,753
It's just the way
the system works.

474
00:24:21,795 --> 00:24:23,338
But here's
the good part.

475
00:24:26,175 --> 00:24:28,343
This is for you.

476
00:24:28,468 --> 00:24:29,761
Pretty good, huh?

477
00:24:31,555 --> 00:24:33,265
A little pocket change.

478
00:24:33,348 --> 00:24:35,642
You must have
saved up a lot.

479
00:24:35,767 --> 00:24:37,895
Nah, I think I spend it
all on your cousin.

480
00:24:39,146 --> 00:24:40,439
All right, well,

481
00:24:40,564 --> 00:24:43,483
we got a few more things
we got to do this week.

482
00:24:43,567 --> 00:24:45,152
And next week, I'll take you
down to the yards

483
00:24:45,277 --> 00:24:46,236
into the tunnels.

484
00:24:46,361 --> 00:24:48,447
That sounds good.

485
00:24:48,572 --> 00:24:50,616
All right.
Let's go do it.

486
00:24:50,699 --> 00:24:52,284
In the business,

487
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:54,661
favors are more important
than threats.

488
00:24:54,786 --> 00:24:57,247
It's about making people
feel wanted and liked,

489
00:24:57,372 --> 00:25:00,209
making them feel
appreciated.

490
00:25:00,292 --> 00:25:01,752
You find out
what they like,

491
00:25:01,877 --> 00:25:04,087
and you makeit
happen for them.

492
00:25:04,171 --> 00:25:06,173
They want to go
to a ball game or a show,

493
00:25:06,215 --> 00:25:08,331
get them the tickets.

494
00:25:08,383 --> 00:25:10,886
They want something for
their wife or their girlfriend,

495
00:25:11,136 --> 00:25:13,013
get them a nice fur.

496
00:25:13,096 --> 00:25:15,891
Sometimes all they want
is an expensive bottle of wine.

497
00:25:16,016 --> 00:25:17,601
If all they want
is cash,

498
00:25:17,684 --> 00:25:19,811
there's always
plenty of that.

499
00:25:19,895 --> 00:25:21,855
If you take care
of them,

500
00:25:21,939 --> 00:25:24,316
this business
can take care of you.

501
00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:28,320
Just don't spend it all
in one place.

502
00:25:34,952 --> 00:25:39,456
Leo, come on, are you ready?
We got to go soon.

503
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:41,041
Ma...

504
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:43,126
I got you something.

505
00:25:44,628 --> 00:25:45,546
What are you doing?

506
00:25:45,629 --> 00:25:47,714
You don't have
to get me anything.

507
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,216
Oh, I wanted to.

508
00:25:49,258 --> 00:25:51,009
I just thought
you needed it.

509
00:25:51,134 --> 00:25:52,344
Oh, Leo, you can't.

510
00:25:52,427 --> 00:25:55,848
Every dollar is saved.
You know that.

511
00:26:06,775 --> 00:26:08,026
It's beautiful.

512
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:09,570
Thank you.

513
00:26:11,363 --> 00:26:12,364
Now, come on.

514
00:26:12,489 --> 00:26:14,366
Frank is sending
a car for us.

515
00:26:14,449 --> 00:26:15,367
All right.

516
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:18,745
I'm just going
to change real quick.

517
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:34,970
That's it
right there.

518
00:26:35,012 --> 00:26:36,471
That's their house.

519
00:26:45,606 --> 00:26:46,732
Bernard,
get the door.

520
00:26:46,815 --> 00:26:48,692
Mom, I'm
already sitting down.

521
00:26:48,775 --> 00:26:49,693
Sorry we're late.

522
00:26:49,776 --> 00:26:50,694
Here they are.

523
00:26:50,777 --> 00:26:52,070
Oh, good. Good. Hey.

524
00:26:52,196 --> 00:26:54,615
Come on in.
Sit down, sit down.

525
00:26:54,698 --> 00:26:55,908
Do me a favor, Will.
Will you sit over there?

526
00:26:55,991 --> 00:26:58,952
Sit over here, Leo.

527
00:26:58,994 --> 00:26:59,953
Good.

528
00:26:59,995 --> 00:27:00,996
Well,
hi, Bernard.

529
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:02,206
This is
a really nice house.

530
00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:04,208
Oh, thanks.
I'm glad you like it.

531
00:27:04,249 --> 00:27:05,417
You know, we're doing
a little work on it.

532
00:27:05,501 --> 00:27:07,461
I'm building a little
family room in the back.

533
00:27:07,544 --> 00:27:09,505
Yeah, and those assholes
come wake us up every morning.

534
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:11,089
Erica, is that
absolutely necessary?

535
00:27:11,215 --> 00:27:12,633
Now, please,
don't start.

536
00:27:12,758 --> 00:27:15,219
Ma, could I have
some of that lomein?

537
00:27:15,302 --> 00:27:17,012
Frank, this all
looks delicious.

538
00:27:17,137 --> 00:27:19,139
Ah, it's a wonderful place.
They got great food.

539
00:27:19,264 --> 00:27:20,933
It's a little
rich sometimes.

540
00:27:21,058 --> 00:27:22,142
Willie,
this is Bernie's dish.

541
00:27:22,267 --> 00:27:23,435
Give it to him.

542
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:24,415
Will you
pass the rice back

543
00:27:24,467 --> 00:27:25,312
when you're
finished with it?

544
00:27:25,646 --> 00:27:27,314
Thanks, Mom.

545
00:27:27,439 --> 00:27:28,398
So, Leo,

546
00:27:28,524 --> 00:27:30,609
did you tell your mother
what we talked about?

547
00:27:32,361 --> 00:27:34,154
What was that?

548
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:36,448
I told him that
I thought maybe he should

549
00:27:36,532 --> 00:27:39,368
look into some training
program as a machinist.

550
00:27:39,451 --> 00:27:41,912
Yeah.
That sounds terrific.

551
00:27:43,372 --> 00:27:44,581
Well, actually,
I went out with Willie,

552
00:27:44,665 --> 00:27:47,167
and I'm thinking
of working with him.

553
00:27:47,251 --> 00:27:48,252
Yeah, Iknow.

554
00:27:48,293 --> 00:27:50,337
I want to talk to you
about that.

555
00:27:50,462 --> 00:27:51,672
Oh,
that sounds good.

556
00:27:51,797 --> 00:27:52,756
The two of them
work together.

557
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,800
That sounds good,
huh?

558
00:27:56,844 --> 00:27:59,096
Uh, I don't understand.

559
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:01,056
I mean, I thought we had
this whole conversation.

560
00:28:02,266 --> 00:28:04,184
I don't feel comfortable
taking your money.

561
00:28:04,309 --> 00:28:05,269
Money?

562
00:28:05,352 --> 00:28:06,854
Oh, no. We've been
through all this.

563
00:28:06,979 --> 00:28:08,856
Nobody's giving us
any money.

564
00:28:08,897 --> 00:28:10,482
Why can't they
work together?

565
00:28:10,566 --> 00:28:11,608
Erica.

566
00:28:20,075 --> 00:28:22,077
It's all right.

567
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:23,787
Leo, I hope every thing
works out for you,

568
00:28:23,871 --> 00:28:27,416
and you'll be around
the business.

569
00:28:27,541 --> 00:28:28,584
Maybe you'll learn
something.

570
00:28:28,709 --> 00:28:30,794
I really hope so.

571
00:28:34,548 --> 00:28:35,507
Good.

572
00:28:35,549 --> 00:28:37,301
Good. All right.

573
00:28:37,384 --> 00:28:38,802
Pass me that.

574
00:28:38,844 --> 00:28:40,512
OK, good.

575
00:28:40,596 --> 00:28:42,181
Clean plate club, OK?

576
00:28:42,306 --> 00:28:43,390
You got
the hot mustard there?

577
00:28:43,515 --> 00:28:45,309
Got to have
the hot mustard.

578
00:28:45,392 --> 00:28:46,810
Ducksauce.

579
00:29:01,742 --> 00:29:03,243
Erica.

580
00:29:04,453 --> 00:29:05,412
Hey.

581
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,540
What?

582
00:29:08,624 --> 00:29:10,125
I want to show you
something.

583
00:29:10,167 --> 00:29:11,126
What?

584
00:29:16,256 --> 00:29:17,716
What is it?

585
00:29:19,593 --> 00:29:20,719
Open it up.

586
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:35,984
Oh, Willie.

587
00:29:38,362 --> 00:29:40,864
We'll tell every one
this weekend.

588
00:29:41,156 --> 00:29:44,493
I want to make this
right.

589
00:30:08,809 --> 00:30:10,227
I love you.

590
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,911
So where we going?

591
00:30:27,995 --> 00:30:30,289
We're going
to the sunny sideyards.

592
00:30:30,414 --> 00:30:32,332
The guys'll be there.
They're waiting for us,

593
00:30:32,416 --> 00:30:34,209
and there's someone new
I want you to meet

594
00:30:34,334 --> 00:30:35,794
that's working
with me now.

595
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:38,338
What are we going
to do down there?

596
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:43,135
We take out our
competitors' trains-

597
00:30:43,218 --> 00:30:44,428
short their stuff out,

598
00:30:44,511 --> 00:30:45,971
make sure
it don't work right.

599
00:30:46,013 --> 00:30:47,639
And they get hit
as unreliable,

600
00:30:47,723 --> 00:30:49,308
and we get the jobs.

601
00:30:49,433 --> 00:30:52,019
Tonight,
it's Weltech's trains.

602
00:30:52,144 --> 00:30:53,520
They're
those fucking guys

603
00:30:53,645 --> 00:30:54,813
we had the run-in with
at Borough Hall,

604
00:30:54,938 --> 00:30:55,856
remember?

605
00:30:59,026 --> 00:31:01,653
I just want you to stand
back and watch tonight.

606
00:31:01,778 --> 00:31:03,363
Everything's going
to be all right.

607
00:31:05,866 --> 00:31:07,451
Boys, what's going on?

608
00:31:07,534 --> 00:31:09,369
How you doing?
What's up, Dante?

609
00:31:09,421 --> 00:31:10,537
How you doing, Todd?

610
00:31:10,871 --> 00:31:12,331
Hey, Leo.

611
00:31:15,959 --> 00:31:17,002
How you doing, man?

612
00:31:17,085 --> 00:31:18,045
What's going on?
How you doing?

613
00:31:18,086 --> 00:31:18,910
Good.

614
00:31:18,962 --> 00:31:21,673
He's coming down with me
to make a drop.

615
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:25,844
You ever in Local One
or Local Three?

616
00:31:25,969 --> 00:31:27,763
No.

617
00:31:27,888 --> 00:31:30,307
Because we don't deal
with construction.

618
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:33,310
I don't know nothing
about that.

619
00:31:34,478 --> 00:31:35,395
All right,
well, you're here

620
00:31:35,479 --> 00:31:37,898
'cause your friends
clear you.

621
00:31:40,067 --> 00:31:42,528
All right,
we're going down.

622
00:32:00,796 --> 00:32:02,256
Leo...

623
00:32:02,297 --> 00:32:03,298
stay here.

624
00:32:03,423 --> 00:32:04,800
Make sure nobody
comes down, all right?

625
00:32:04,925 --> 00:32:08,804
All right. I'll hang
right here for you.

626
00:32:34,454 --> 00:32:36,415
Got you
those Knicks tickets.

627
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:38,959
This is for you.

628
00:32:39,042 --> 00:32:41,128
I don't want it, Willie.

629
00:32:41,253 --> 00:32:43,130
You got to get your guys
off the tracks.

630
00:32:43,255 --> 00:32:44,256
What are you
talking about?

631
00:32:44,308 --> 00:32:45,924
You've been moved out.

632
00:32:46,258 --> 00:32:47,384
What?

633
00:32:47,467 --> 00:32:48,468
Weltech
come in here last week,

634
00:32:48,552 --> 00:32:50,262
and they put 2K
right there.

635
00:32:50,345 --> 00:32:52,306
And they got the muscle
to back it up.

636
00:32:52,347 --> 00:32:54,141
Come on.
You know how this works.

637
00:32:54,266 --> 00:32:55,559
Somebody comes to you
with a better offer,

638
00:32:55,642 --> 00:32:56,560
you come back at us.

639
00:32:56,643 --> 00:32:57,936
No, not any more.

640
00:32:58,061 --> 00:32:59,563
Wordis Electric Rail's
going under,

641
00:32:59,646 --> 00:33:00,772
and Weltech
guaranteed me

642
00:33:00,824 --> 00:33:01,899
they'd match any offer.

643
00:33:02,191 --> 00:33:03,901
Now, Willie,
get them off the tracks,

644
00:33:03,984 --> 00:33:05,861
'cause I got the cops
coming down here.

645
00:33:05,986 --> 00:33:07,446
Keep going.

646
00:33:13,869 --> 00:33:15,078
Come on, Elliot.

647
00:33:15,162 --> 00:33:16,914
You wouldn't
do that to us.

648
00:33:23,587 --> 00:33:24,796
What the fuck
are you doing?

649
00:33:24,922 --> 00:33:26,089
Jump!

650
00:33:30,302 --> 00:33:31,762
Willie!

651
00:33:33,847 --> 00:33:35,474
Will!

652
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:37,601
Hey, what are you doing?

653
00:33:37,684 --> 00:33:39,019
Nothing.

654
00:33:39,144 --> 00:33:41,480
Nothing? What do you
mean, nothing?

655
00:33:43,148 --> 00:33:44,483
I ought to crack
your fucking head open,

656
00:33:44,608 --> 00:33:46,527
you know that?

657
00:33:46,652 --> 00:33:48,111
Turn that thing off.

658
00:33:51,031 --> 00:33:52,199
What the fuck you going
to do with that?

659
00:33:52,324 --> 00:33:54,493
Turn that
fucking thing off.

660
00:33:54,618 --> 00:33:55,744
Hey, I'm talking to you.

661
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:58,956
You got some I.D.?

662
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:07,130
Don't fucking
do it, man.

663
00:34:07,256 --> 00:34:08,423
Uhh!

664
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:14,221
Uhh...

665
00:34:16,181 --> 00:34:17,641
All right, put your hands up.
Turn around.

666
00:34:18,934 --> 00:34:20,018
You motherfucker!

667
00:34:20,143 --> 00:34:21,728
Listen, I didn't
do nothing!

668
00:34:21,854 --> 00:34:23,355
You want to run?

669
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,942
I ought to break you
down, motherfucker!

670
00:34:28,277 --> 00:34:29,236
Ohh!

671
00:34:32,573 --> 00:34:34,074
Huhh!

672
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:03,061
Hello?

673
00:35:03,187 --> 00:35:06,481
Mrs. Handler.
Hey, is Leo there?

674
00:35:06,607 --> 00:35:08,567
I'm here, Ma.
You can hang up.

675
00:35:09,693 --> 00:35:11,111
Leo...

676
00:35:11,195 --> 00:35:12,613
you got to know I didn't mean
to do it. You know that.

677
00:35:12,665 --> 00:35:13,697
Willie,
what the fuck happened?

678
00:35:13,947 --> 00:35:15,032
You said every thing was
going to be all right.

679
00:35:15,115 --> 00:35:16,116
I know, I know.

680
00:35:16,241 --> 00:35:17,993
Everything
got fucked up.

681
00:35:18,118 --> 00:35:19,828
Did anyone see you?
What'd you do?

682
00:35:19,953 --> 00:35:20,913
What do you mean,
what did I do?

683
00:35:20,954 --> 00:35:21,914
A fucking cop
came down there

684
00:35:21,955 --> 00:35:25,417
and beat me
on my fucking head.

685
00:35:25,542 --> 00:35:27,002
You OK?

686
00:35:27,127 --> 00:35:29,922
Yeah, I'm all right, but
I don't know about the cop.

687
00:35:30,005 --> 00:35:32,716
All right.
We can't panic.

688
00:35:32,799 --> 00:35:35,260
I'll talk to Frank,
and he'll know what to do.

689
00:35:35,302 --> 00:35:37,429
Don't worry, Leo.
The borough can't afford

690
00:35:37,513 --> 00:35:39,097
arrests
and investigations.

691
00:35:39,223 --> 00:35:41,517
The fucking politicians
are in on it.

692
00:35:41,642 --> 00:35:43,310
You understand?

693
00:35:43,435 --> 00:35:45,103
I understand.

694
00:35:48,815 --> 00:35:50,817
Willie?

695
00:35:50,943 --> 00:35:53,028
Hey...

696
00:35:53,153 --> 00:35:56,281
I didn't know you were
staying here tonight.

697
00:35:56,333 --> 00:35:59,159
I had to get out
of that fucking house.

698
00:36:01,537 --> 00:36:02,996
Who's that?

699
00:36:14,758 --> 00:36:15,801
Who is it?

700
00:36:15,884 --> 00:36:17,261
It's Raymond.

701
00:36:21,974 --> 00:36:24,059
What the fuck
happened?

702
00:36:24,184 --> 00:36:25,644
I can't talk right now.

703
00:36:25,769 --> 00:36:28,480
Get the guys, and we'll meet
back at the office tonight.

704
00:36:28,564 --> 00:36:30,023
All right?

705
00:36:31,066 --> 00:36:33,193
Is that blood
on your hand?

706
00:36:33,569 --> 00:36:35,487
It's nothing.
I cut myself.

707
00:36:35,571 --> 00:36:37,030
Go on.

708
00:36:47,624 --> 00:36:48,657
Who was that?

709
00:36:48,709 --> 00:36:50,586
It was just
someone from work.

710
00:36:50,878 --> 00:36:52,171
Now?

711
00:36:52,296 --> 00:36:53,213
Don't worry about it.

712
00:36:53,297 --> 00:36:55,799
Just go back
to sleep.

713
00:37:12,316 --> 00:37:13,525
Hello.

714
00:37:16,111 --> 00:37:17,613
Hold on.

715
00:37:17,738 --> 00:37:18,739
Who is it?

716
00:37:18,864 --> 00:37:20,157
I don't know.

717
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:27,831
Yeah?

718
00:37:27,915 --> 00:37:30,042
You had some
trouble this morning?

719
00:37:31,835 --> 00:37:33,045
Who is this?

720
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:34,880
You know,
the yard master is dead,

721
00:37:34,963 --> 00:37:38,133
and that cop may not
make it, either.

722
00:37:38,258 --> 00:37:39,635
Hector, is that you?

723
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,844
If you come forward,

724
00:37:40,928 --> 00:37:43,347
Weltech has some
very good lawyers.

725
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:46,934
Don't call here again.

726
00:37:50,979 --> 00:37:53,440
What does
every body want?

727
00:37:55,943 --> 00:37:57,736
I'm sorry
it's so crazy here.

728
00:37:57,861 --> 00:38:00,489
I didn't know you were
gonna be here this morning.

729
00:38:04,701 --> 00:38:07,913
I can't wait
till we get married.

730
00:38:12,376 --> 00:38:14,586
Hey.

731
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:16,672
I'll tell my mother,

732
00:38:16,797 --> 00:38:19,758
and we'll
get married.

733
00:38:27,975 --> 00:38:30,477
We're gonna
have a whole family.

734
00:39:03,552 --> 00:39:04,803
What's the matter?

735
00:39:04,928 --> 00:39:08,140
Nothin'. I'm tired.

736
00:39:20,068 --> 00:39:21,028
Si.

737
00:39:22,446 --> 00:39:24,531
El esta en un meeting.

738
00:39:24,656 --> 00:39:27,117
Korman.. I mean, we already
got enough problems

739
00:39:27,201 --> 00:39:28,952
with them in or it is
as it is.

740
00:39:29,036 --> 00:39:30,078
Goddamn conglomerates

741
00:39:30,204 --> 00:39:31,163
lose their
defense contracts

742
00:39:31,205 --> 00:39:32,164
out on the island,

743
00:39:32,206 --> 00:39:33,165
then suddenly they're back

744
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:34,374
in the goddamn train
business.

745
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,834
We understand
your problem,

746
00:39:35,959 --> 00:39:36,960
but there's nothin'
we can do about it right now.

747
00:39:37,044 --> 00:39:38,962
Look, I'm gettin'
squeezed from all sides.

748
00:39:39,046 --> 00:39:40,297
You got the fuckin'
conglomerates

749
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,799
comin' in here takin' away
the work at the top.

750
00:39:42,883 --> 00:39:43,800
The minorities are
guaranteed the work

751
00:39:43,884 --> 00:39:44,801
at the bottom, and me,

752
00:39:44,885 --> 00:39:46,053
I'm squeezed
in the goddamn middle.

753
00:39:46,178 --> 00:39:47,471
Frank,
take it easy, will you?

754
00:39:47,554 --> 00:39:48,805
You got to wait
till after the election.

755
00:39:48,889 --> 00:39:49,713
Oh,
after the election?

756
00:39:49,765 --> 00:39:51,350
After this election,
the next election?

757
00:39:51,683 --> 00:39:52,684
There's always
an election.

758
00:39:52,809 --> 00:39:54,811
You have to
be patient, Frank.

759
00:39:54,895 --> 00:39:57,272
Well, you listen to me.

760
00:39:57,397 --> 00:39:58,982
You gotta kill
these minority quotas,

761
00:39:59,066 --> 00:40:00,067
or I'm out of business.

762
00:40:00,192 --> 00:40:01,568
It's as simple as that.

763
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:03,779
It's too hot
for us right now.

764
00:40:03,904 --> 00:40:04,863
We got this killing
in the yards.

765
00:40:04,988 --> 00:40:07,074
I mean, who knows
where that's gonna go?

766
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:08,492
You know anything
about that, Frank?

767
00:40:08,575 --> 00:40:10,828
No. I do know if
it were any of my guys,

768
00:40:10,911 --> 00:40:12,412
I'd fuckin' kill 'em.
All right?

769
00:40:12,496 --> 00:40:14,081
Well, we hear
that cop's still alive, Frank.

770
00:40:14,206 --> 00:40:15,624
He's in a coma.

771
00:40:15,707 --> 00:40:18,502
If he pulls through and it
turns out to be the business,

772
00:40:18,585 --> 00:40:20,212
all holy hell's
gonna break loose.

773
00:40:20,295 --> 00:40:21,797
Yeah, the cops'll
be all over us.

774
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:23,257
There's no way
we could control it.

775
00:40:25,133 --> 00:40:26,134
Si, si.

776
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:27,219
Times are changin'.

777
00:40:27,302 --> 00:40:29,012
What? What is it?

778
00:40:29,096 --> 00:40:30,556
It's me.

779
00:40:30,597 --> 00:40:31,849
Hey, Willie.

780
00:40:31,932 --> 00:40:34,601
What do you need?

781
00:40:34,726 --> 00:40:36,520
I want to talk to you
about something.

782
00:40:36,603 --> 00:40:38,814
Well, I'm very
busy right now.

783
00:40:45,028 --> 00:40:47,030
It's no big deal.

784
00:40:47,114 --> 00:40:48,907
I can take care
of it myself.

785
00:40:49,032 --> 00:40:51,451
All right. Good.

786
00:40:51,503 --> 00:40:52,619
Good.

787
00:40:57,541 --> 00:40:59,251
Look,
what I'm tellin' you here

788
00:40:59,334 --> 00:41:01,753
is that my company's
in serious fuckin' trouble.

789
00:41:01,837 --> 00:41:03,255
Do you understand?

790
00:41:06,341 --> 00:41:08,844
A metropolitan
community transit worker

791
00:41:08,886 --> 00:41:10,345
is dead,

792
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:13,640
and a police officer is in
a coma after a predawn attack

793
00:41:13,765 --> 00:41:15,767
at the Sunnyside
repair yards in Queens.

794
00:41:15,893 --> 00:41:17,853
Police say
Officer Gerald Rifkin

795
00:41:17,978 --> 00:41:20,063
responded to an alarm call
at the repair yards

796
00:41:20,147 --> 00:41:22,065
just after
1:00 this morning.

797
00:41:22,107 --> 00:41:23,358
10 minutes later,

798
00:41:23,484 --> 00:41:25,861
police backup units
discovered Officer Rifkin

799
00:41:25,903 --> 00:41:28,280
face down and unconscious
on the tracks.

800
00:41:28,363 --> 00:41:30,115
The body of yardmaster
Elliot Gorwitz

801
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:32,201
was also found nearby
in his office.

802
00:41:32,326 --> 00:41:34,411
He had bled to death
from a single stab wound.

803
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:38,290
Gorwitz had worked
for the MCT for 14 years.

804
00:41:38,373 --> 00:41:39,875
Queensborough President
Arthur Mydanick

805
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,084
said he was shocked
and saddened

806
00:41:41,168 --> 00:41:42,961
when he learned
about the incident.

807
00:41:43,086 --> 00:41:45,088
Of course I was-I was
very upset to hear about this.

808
00:41:45,172 --> 00:41:47,132
I mean, we're not going to
stand for these kind of attacks.

809
00:41:47,216 --> 00:41:48,675
We're gonna put
finding the assailants

810
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,718
at the top
of our agenda right now.

811
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:50,969
Officer Rifkin

812
00:41:51,345 --> 00:41:53,305
remains listed
in critical condition,

813
00:41:53,388 --> 00:41:56,475
and tonight, police
are still without a suspect.

814
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,518
Nice.

815
00:41:57,601 --> 00:41:58,519
I need milk.

816
00:41:58,602 --> 00:41:59,603
I'll get it,
Aunt Val.

817
00:41:59,686 --> 00:42:02,189
Oh, thanks, honey.

818
00:42:02,314 --> 00:42:04,608
You still go
to Waldbaum's?

819
00:42:05,108 --> 00:42:06,735
Yeah, sometimes.

820
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:08,737
Leo, is that
for you?

821
00:42:08,821 --> 00:42:10,489
Yeah.
I got it, Mom.

822
00:42:16,036 --> 00:42:17,913
What's goin' on?

823
00:42:18,038 --> 00:42:19,122
We gotta talk.

824
00:42:19,206 --> 00:42:21,333
The guys are waitin'
for us downstairs.

825
00:42:21,416 --> 00:42:22,835
All right.
Let me get my jacket.

826
00:42:22,918 --> 00:42:25,379
Willie, we're havin'
some cake. Come on in.

827
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:26,505
Oh, thank you,
Mrs. Handler.

828
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:27,714
I can't right now.
I gotta go.

829
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,508
But Erica's here.

830
00:42:29,633 --> 00:42:31,051
Don't you want
to come in?Come on.

831
00:42:31,134 --> 00:42:32,427
Yeah, come on in.

832
00:42:34,638 --> 00:42:36,849
Hey, I didn't know
you were here.

833
00:42:36,932 --> 00:42:39,017
Yep.

834
00:42:40,561 --> 00:42:42,729
Hi.

835
00:42:42,855 --> 00:42:44,022
Hi, Mrs. Olchin.

836
00:42:44,147 --> 00:42:45,566
You look very
handsome tonight.

837
00:42:45,649 --> 00:42:47,860
Thank you.

838
00:42:47,943 --> 00:42:49,862
Excuse me.
I gotta run.

839
00:42:49,945 --> 00:42:50,863
- Well-
- no, no, no.

840
00:42:51,947 --> 00:42:54,867
Come here.

841
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:58,370
Ma...

842
00:42:58,453 --> 00:43:02,374
Willie and me, we talked
about maybe gettin' married.

843
00:43:09,798 --> 00:43:11,758
Well, when did this happen?

844
00:43:11,884 --> 00:43:13,677
We talked
about it last night.

845
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,888
What about school?

846
00:43:16,013 --> 00:43:17,764
I'm still gonna finish.

847
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:19,766
Well, this is
a very big step.

848
00:43:19,808 --> 00:43:20,893
Don't you think
we should, uh...

849
00:43:20,976 --> 00:43:23,478
discuss it? Hmm?

850
00:43:28,942 --> 00:43:30,611
Hey, Will,
is that them?

851
00:43:32,237 --> 00:43:33,197
Yeah.

852
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,574
No, thanks, huh?

853
00:43:35,699 --> 00:43:37,493
I really gotta go.

854
00:43:37,618 --> 00:43:38,494
I didn't know
we were gonna

855
00:43:38,619 --> 00:43:40,037
get into
all this right now.

856
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:42,122
I think
we should discuss this.

857
00:43:45,626 --> 00:43:48,921
Hey, Will,
they're waitin'.

858
00:43:49,004 --> 00:43:51,423
Sorry.

859
00:43:51,507 --> 00:43:52,716
Let's go.

860
00:43:56,803 --> 00:43:58,597
Leo.

861
00:44:01,058 --> 00:44:02,935
I got a call from Weltech...

862
00:44:03,018 --> 00:44:04,436
that guy Hector.

863
00:44:04,478 --> 00:44:06,939
They heard about
what happened.

864
00:44:08,232 --> 00:44:09,858
They want to
offer me protection

865
00:44:09,983 --> 00:44:12,319
if I come forward
and talk to their lawyers.

866
00:44:12,361 --> 00:44:14,947
They'd do anything
to get somethin' on Frank.

867
00:44:16,365 --> 00:44:18,450
Don't you fuckin'
turn on me, Willie.

868
00:44:18,534 --> 00:44:20,577
Of course not.

869
00:44:20,661 --> 00:44:23,247
I hung up
on the fuckin' guy.

870
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:27,125
I'm just sayin'
we gotta stay tight here.

871
00:44:27,251 --> 00:44:29,670
Hey, you gotta listen to
what the guys have to say.

872
00:44:29,753 --> 00:44:33,048
Just- just listen
to what they have to say.

873
00:44:34,341 --> 00:44:37,135
Because we're in
a very tough situation.

874
00:44:46,061 --> 00:44:46,979
What's up, Todd?

875
00:44:47,062 --> 00:44:48,063
What's goin' on?

876
00:44:48,188 --> 00:44:49,398
Just get in the back.

877
00:44:49,523 --> 00:44:51,150
That cop you hit?

878
00:44:51,275 --> 00:44:53,777
He's a big
fuckin' problem for us.

879
00:44:53,861 --> 00:44:56,989
If he wakes up,
we're all in trouble.

880
00:44:57,072 --> 00:44:59,658
We don't know what you might
do to stay out of jail.

881
00:44:59,783 --> 00:45:01,775
I wouldn't fuck you.

882
00:45:01,827 --> 00:45:05,289
Yeah, but you get caught now,
and it's life for you.

883
00:45:06,999 --> 00:45:08,792
Will, you know
I wouldn't do that.

884
00:45:08,876 --> 00:45:10,419
What happened?

885
00:45:10,544 --> 00:45:12,421
I thought you were
gonna talk to Frank.

886
00:45:12,504 --> 00:45:15,883
Frank's got no pull
with the police.

887
00:45:27,728 --> 00:45:30,105
He's on the fourth
floor at booth memorial.

888
00:45:30,147 --> 00:45:32,065
4 beds to a room.

889
00:45:32,107 --> 00:45:33,525
Todd's friend's
an orderly.

890
00:45:33,609 --> 00:45:34,610
He works the night shift.

891
00:45:34,735 --> 00:45:36,612
He'll get you in.

892
00:45:36,653 --> 00:45:38,197
They got one officer

893
00:45:38,322 --> 00:45:40,324
in front of the ward.
That's it.

894
00:45:40,407 --> 00:45:42,159
He's on an 8-hour shift.

895
00:45:42,211 --> 00:45:43,911
Wait till
he takes a leak,

896
00:45:44,244 --> 00:45:45,829
and then you go inside.

897
00:45:47,623 --> 00:45:49,875
That guy's
a fuckin' cop.

898
00:45:49,958 --> 00:45:54,379
Nobody wants this, Leo.

899
00:45:54,421 --> 00:45:56,882
It's the only thing
we can do.

900
00:45:58,967 --> 00:46:01,762
I don't know
if I could do this.

901
00:46:01,887 --> 00:46:03,138
Well,
you think about it,

902
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:06,058
'cause the only thing
that cop saw was you.

903
00:46:06,141 --> 00:46:07,893
If you can't take care
of this for us,

904
00:46:07,976 --> 00:46:11,563
we gotta take care
of it ourselves.

905
00:46:11,647 --> 00:46:13,482
We are not goin'
after that fuckin' cop.

906
00:46:13,565 --> 00:46:15,150
Do you understand?

907
00:46:39,174 --> 00:46:40,384
All right.
You guys wait here.

908
00:46:40,467 --> 00:46:43,178
Todd's gonna
talk to his guy.

909
00:46:43,303 --> 00:46:45,180
Come on.

910
00:46:50,644 --> 00:46:51,937
Leo...

911
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:56,441
if anything happens,

912
00:46:56,483 --> 00:46:59,778
if anything goes wrong,

913
00:46:59,903 --> 00:47:02,322
then you run,

914
00:47:02,406 --> 00:47:05,409
and you get
the fuck out of the city.

915
00:47:09,621 --> 00:47:13,500
I'll look in on your mother.

916
00:47:17,713 --> 00:47:21,216
I feel like I'm
gonna fuckin' die.

917
00:47:24,636 --> 00:47:27,723
Come on, man.
My break's almost over.

918
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:15,187
Don't you fuckin' back out.

919
00:51:05,232 --> 00:51:09,570
Well, now.
How are we feeling?

920
00:51:09,653 --> 00:51:10,779
I called
your family, Jerry.

921
00:51:11,071 --> 00:51:13,031
They're on their way down,
allright?

922
00:51:13,157 --> 00:51:15,742
You were out
cold there for a while.

923
00:51:20,247 --> 00:51:23,709
Just rest.
You just need some rest.

924
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:27,379
Charlie. Charlie, 10-4.

925
00:51:41,768 --> 00:51:43,896
Fuck. Fuck.

926
00:51:52,237 --> 00:51:53,197
What happened?

927
00:51:53,238 --> 00:51:55,407
Goddamn motherfucker
ran away!

928
00:51:56,783 --> 00:51:58,076
Your friend
is fuckin' dead, Willie.

929
00:51:58,202 --> 00:52:01,205
You hear me?
He's fuckin' dead!

930
00:52:11,924 --> 00:52:13,342
What's wrong?

931
00:52:13,425 --> 00:52:16,428
He didn't come home
last night... from work.

932
00:52:16,553 --> 00:52:17,846
What happened?

933
00:52:17,971 --> 00:52:19,932
I don't know.

934
00:52:20,057 --> 00:52:21,683
He missed his parole
meeting this morning.

935
00:52:21,735 --> 00:52:23,310
They called here.
They're lookin' for him.

936
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:26,271
They said
he's in violation.

937
00:52:26,355 --> 00:52:27,898
He's in violation.

938
00:52:28,023 --> 00:52:30,234
All right. Sit down.
Calm down, huh?

939
00:52:30,317 --> 00:52:31,276
Let's just sit down.

940
00:52:31,318 --> 00:52:32,528
Yeah, but what if...

941
00:52:32,653 --> 00:52:35,113
what if
something happened?

942
00:52:35,239 --> 00:52:36,323
Val, listen to me.

943
00:52:37,658 --> 00:52:38,826
You're my sister,
I love you,

944
00:52:38,951 --> 00:52:41,411
and you can't let this
keep killing you.

945
00:52:41,495 --> 00:52:43,455
You hear me?

946
00:52:46,542 --> 00:52:48,544
Hmm?

947
00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:03,100
OK, gentlemen.

948
00:53:03,183 --> 00:53:07,771
Right in here.
All the way down the tracks.

949
00:53:07,855 --> 00:53:09,982
Take your pictures
of our circuit layouts

950
00:53:10,065 --> 00:53:11,984
in the train signal boxes.

951
00:53:13,402 --> 00:53:15,487
Build them to the specs.

952
00:53:15,571 --> 00:53:19,074
Preference will be given
to minority companies

953
00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:22,119
for a portion
of these contracts.

954
00:53:32,713 --> 00:53:34,214
You think about
what I said?

955
00:53:34,339 --> 00:53:36,800
Get off.

956
00:53:36,884 --> 00:53:39,011
Pendejo.

957
00:53:41,388 --> 00:53:44,099
Hey, Terr. You gonna
help us out a little here?

958
00:53:44,224 --> 00:53:45,142
I wouldn't even bother

959
00:53:45,225 --> 00:53:46,810
with a bid on this one
if I were you.

960
00:53:48,145 --> 00:53:49,897
What? What are you
talking about?

961
00:53:50,022 --> 00:53:51,940
Word come from
the inspector general.

962
00:53:52,065 --> 00:53:53,525
The cop that was hit
went through the books

963
00:53:53,609 --> 00:53:55,402
and come up with a suspect.

964
00:53:55,527 --> 00:53:56,445
It's your nephew.

965
00:53:58,155 --> 00:54:01,325
Sorry to have to be
the one to tell you.

966
00:54:01,408 --> 00:54:02,993
You're gonna get caught.

967
00:54:03,118 --> 00:54:04,161
Shut the fuck up.

968
00:54:05,579 --> 00:54:07,664
You'll be
the first one to go.

969
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:10,459
Contractor.. Hey, hey, hey!
Come on! Watchit!

970
00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:16,131
Knock it off. Settle down.

971
00:54:16,256 --> 00:54:17,257
What's
the matter with you, huh?

972
00:54:17,382 --> 00:54:18,342
Why didn't you
fuckin' tell me?

973
00:54:18,467 --> 00:54:20,135
We were gonna try
and handle it on our own.

974
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:21,178
On your own?
You fucking idiot.

975
00:54:21,261 --> 00:54:22,554
On your own?

976
00:54:22,638 --> 00:54:24,598
Willie, this could
be devastating for us.

977
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:26,350
If the borough connects us
to what happened,

978
00:54:26,433 --> 00:54:27,559
we're out of business.

979
00:54:27,643 --> 00:54:28,685
I mean, we could
all go to jail.

980
00:54:28,769 --> 00:54:29,770
I should've
never let him

981
00:54:29,822 --> 00:54:30,719
go down there with you.

982
00:54:30,771 --> 00:54:32,272
Goddamn accident
waiting to happen.

983
00:54:32,397 --> 00:54:34,066
Frank,
it's gonna be all right.

984
00:54:34,149 --> 00:54:35,734
Leo's gone.

985
00:54:35,859 --> 00:54:37,569
Nobody knows
he was workin' for us.

986
00:54:37,694 --> 00:54:40,072
But they're not
gonna stop investigating.

987
00:54:40,155 --> 00:54:41,740
What do you think, there's
a statute of limitations

988
00:54:41,865 --> 00:54:42,950
for a murder case?

989
00:54:43,075 --> 00:54:45,744
Who killed
the yardmaster?

990
00:54:45,869 --> 00:54:47,788
Was it Leo?

991
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:55,963
I understand.

992
00:54:56,088 --> 00:54:57,965
Tryin' to protect
your friend.

993
00:54:58,006 --> 00:54:59,758
Frank, we're gonna
have to distance ourselves

994
00:54:59,883 --> 00:55:01,176
from your nephew.

995
00:55:01,301 --> 00:55:03,220
Issue a denial, say
that he never worked here.

996
00:55:03,303 --> 00:55:04,888
I'll talk
to the accountants,

997
00:55:04,972 --> 00:55:07,266
make sure they
didn't file any W-2s.

998
00:55:07,391 --> 00:55:08,809
I'll also
put out a statement-

999
00:55:08,934 --> 00:55:11,603
We're all very saddened
by the turn of events,

1000
00:55:11,687 --> 00:55:12,813
et cetera and so forth.

1001
00:55:12,938 --> 00:55:14,898
Please.
None of that's gonna hold.

1002
00:55:15,023 --> 00:55:16,984
At some point it's
gonna lead back to us.

1003
00:55:18,318 --> 00:55:20,821
What we gotta do
is talk to this cop...

1004
00:55:20,946 --> 00:55:21,905
see what it'll take

1005
00:55:21,989 --> 00:55:23,740
to make him remember
things differently.

1006
00:55:23,824 --> 00:55:26,451
Tonight's the
borough president's party.

1007
00:55:26,535 --> 00:55:27,953
I'll talk to Seymour...

1008
00:55:27,995 --> 00:55:31,623
see if it's something
we can pursue.

1009
00:55:34,918 --> 00:55:37,421
I thought
I could help him.

1010
00:55:37,713 --> 00:55:41,133
I thought I was
gonna help him.

1011
00:56:06,283 --> 00:56:07,743
I'm sorry.

1012
00:56:18,670 --> 00:56:20,130
What, are we
waitin' for them?

1013
00:56:20,214 --> 00:56:21,673
We're always
waiting for them.

1014
00:56:21,798 --> 00:56:24,259
Hello?

1015
00:56:24,384 --> 00:56:26,178
Hey, Bernie.

1016
00:56:26,261 --> 00:56:27,179
Hey.

1017
00:56:27,262 --> 00:56:28,180
How ya doin'?

1018
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:37,981
Come on,
we ready?

1019
00:56:38,023 --> 00:56:39,817
we'll be
right down.

1020
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:41,068
Right down?

1021
00:56:41,193 --> 00:56:43,153
What's the problem?

1022
00:56:43,278 --> 00:56:45,364
Is Willie
downstairs?

1023
00:56:45,489 --> 00:56:47,866
Yeah.

1024
00:56:52,913 --> 00:56:54,206
Well?

1025
00:56:54,289 --> 00:56:56,375
They're thinking
about getting married.

1026
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:59,002
I'm not gonna talk
about it with him here.

1027
00:57:00,796 --> 00:57:03,006
He's not my father.

1028
00:57:03,090 --> 00:57:06,218
Your mother
looks very upset.

1029
00:57:06,301 --> 00:57:07,302
Don't you
think you should at least

1030
00:57:07,427 --> 00:57:09,096
discuss it with her?
Hmm?

1031
00:57:09,221 --> 00:57:10,597
Could you get the fuck
out of my room?

1032
00:57:10,722 --> 00:57:12,182
- Hey.
- Frank.. it's all right.

1033
00:57:12,307 --> 00:57:14,601
Listen, you do
what you want to do.

1034
00:57:14,726 --> 00:57:17,855
You want to upset
your mother, go ahead.

1035
00:57:17,938 --> 00:57:19,523
You want to run
into this thing

1036
00:57:19,648 --> 00:57:21,567
without thinkin'
about it,

1037
00:57:21,608 --> 00:57:24,736
you do that,
but get ready.

1038
00:57:26,822 --> 00:57:27,739
Get ready.

1039
00:57:43,630 --> 00:57:44,756
Man.. Thank you.

1040
00:57:49,052 --> 00:57:49,928
Sweetie...

1041
00:57:50,053 --> 00:57:51,263
is he
enjoying it?

1042
00:57:51,346 --> 00:57:52,639
Hi, Harriet.
How are you?

1043
00:57:52,764 --> 00:57:54,141
Let's go find Arthur and
wish him a happy birthday.

1044
00:57:54,266 --> 00:57:55,142
Yes, you
want to come?

1045
00:57:55,267 --> 00:57:56,143
Oh, no. I've
said enough.

1046
00:57:56,268 --> 00:57:57,644
You've said enough.

1047
00:58:12,868 --> 00:58:14,369
There he is.

1048
00:58:14,411 --> 00:58:15,370
Hey, Manny.

1049
00:58:15,412 --> 00:58:16,371
Hey, Frank.

1050
00:58:16,413 --> 00:58:17,664
Good to see you.

1051
00:58:17,789 --> 00:58:18,999
- How are you?
- Good.

1052
00:58:20,125 --> 00:58:21,084
Arthur.

1053
00:58:26,590 --> 00:58:28,467
I don't think he heard you.

1054
00:58:35,390 --> 00:58:37,643
Looks like they got some
nice roast beef over there.

1055
00:58:37,684 --> 00:58:38,685
Why don't you guys
go sit down?

1056
00:58:38,811 --> 00:58:40,479
And I'll join you
in a minute.

1057
00:58:40,521 --> 00:58:41,522
All right.

1058
00:58:44,608 --> 00:58:47,319
What is this? I try
to go say hello to art,

1059
00:58:47,402 --> 00:58:48,862
and he gives me
the cold shoulder.

1060
00:58:48,946 --> 00:58:49,947
He can't be seen
with you right now.

1061
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:51,031
You gotta understand that.

1062
00:58:51,083 --> 00:58:51,772
He embarrassed me.

1063
00:58:51,824 --> 00:58:53,200
I mean, you know
how much money

1064
00:58:53,534 --> 00:58:54,993
I give to this
fuckin' guy's campaign?

1065
00:58:55,035 --> 00:58:58,038
Just wait till things
calm down a bit, all right?

1066
00:58:58,872 --> 00:59:00,332
Look, uh,

1067
00:59:00,415 --> 00:59:02,000
w- what do you know
about this here cop?

1068
00:59:02,125 --> 00:59:03,335
You know, the one
that's givin' us

1069
00:59:03,418 --> 00:59:04,336
all the hassle?

1070
00:59:04,419 --> 00:59:05,420
They say he's-

1071
00:59:05,546 --> 00:59:06,964
They say he's pretty
sure about a suspect.

1072
00:59:07,047 --> 00:59:08,048
Well, how sure?

1073
00:59:08,131 --> 00:59:10,133
I don't know.

1074
00:59:10,217 --> 00:59:11,635
What are you trying to say?

1075
00:59:11,677 --> 00:59:13,637
Well, I thought maybe...

1076
00:59:13,679 --> 00:59:16,223
we could create
a little fund for him.

1077
00:59:16,348 --> 00:59:19,247
You know, he was hit
in the head,

1078
00:59:19,299 --> 00:59:22,146
and maybe he don't
remember so good.

1079
00:59:22,563 --> 00:59:23,689
I could do
a little diggin'.

1080
00:59:23,741 --> 00:59:25,232
Oh, good.
You do that.

1081
00:59:25,566 --> 00:59:27,734
'Cause we want
to help him out.

1082
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:29,278
And before
this investigation

1083
00:59:29,361 --> 00:59:30,946
gets completely
out of hand.

1084
00:59:53,010 --> 00:59:54,386
Come on!

1085
00:59:54,469 --> 00:59:55,596
Don't move!

1086
00:59:55,679 --> 00:59:56,670
Warrant service, ma'am.

1087
00:59:56,722 --> 00:59:58,557
We're looking for your son.
Is he here?

1088
00:59:58,974 --> 01:00:00,392
No.
What are you doing?

1089
01:00:00,434 --> 01:00:02,978
We got
a warrant for his arrest.

1090
01:00:03,103 --> 01:00:04,521
Ma'am, what are you doing?
You all right?

1091
01:00:07,483 --> 01:00:10,027
He's not here.
Please.

1092
01:00:10,110 --> 01:00:11,111
Over here,Joe!

1093
01:00:11,163 --> 01:00:12,279
Ma'am.

1094
01:00:12,404 --> 01:00:13,780
Looks like she'shaving

1095
01:00:13,822 --> 01:00:14,865
chest pains, Kevin.

1096
01:00:14,990 --> 01:00:16,408
Toss it all out!
Come on!

1097
01:00:16,450 --> 01:00:17,826
Check it for weapons!

1098
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:20,287
She's having problems.

1099
01:00:20,329 --> 01:00:21,288
Call paramedics.

1100
01:00:26,126 --> 01:00:27,544
Officer Gerald Rifkin

1101
01:00:27,628 --> 01:00:29,421
will soon be
on his way home.

1102
01:00:29,505 --> 01:00:32,216
Rifkin, who was injured
in an attack early Saturday

1103
01:00:32,257 --> 01:00:35,719
at the Sunnyside rail yards
in Queens, has recovered.

1104
01:00:35,844 --> 01:00:38,305
And tonight he has given
police their first lead

1105
01:00:38,347 --> 01:00:39,890
in their search
for his assailant

1106
01:00:40,015 --> 01:00:42,434
and the killer
of an MCT yardmaster.

1107
01:00:42,518 --> 01:00:44,520
After reviewing
police mugbooks,

1108
01:00:44,561 --> 01:00:46,438
Rifkin positively
identified

1109
01:00:46,522 --> 01:00:49,149
24-year-old ex-convict
Leo Handler

1110
01:00:49,233 --> 01:00:50,567
as his assailant.

1111
01:00:50,651 --> 01:00:51,944
And although police believe

1112
01:00:52,027 --> 01:00:53,654
Handler may have
fled the state,

1113
01:00:53,737 --> 01:00:54,947
they are asking anyone

1114
01:00:55,030 --> 01:00:57,074
with any information
as to his whereabouts

1115
01:00:57,157 --> 01:00:59,535
to contact them
immediately.

1116
01:00:59,576 --> 01:01:02,246
Coming up... where were you
when the lights went out?

1117
01:01:05,499 --> 01:01:06,542
Hello?

1118
01:01:06,667 --> 01:01:09,127
It's me, Will.

1119
01:01:09,253 --> 01:01:10,379
Leo.

1120
01:01:12,297 --> 01:01:15,133
Where are you?
You OK?

1121
01:01:17,344 --> 01:01:19,680
They're blaming me
for things I didn'tdo.

1122
01:01:19,763 --> 01:01:20,764
They're blaming me
for every thing,

1123
01:01:20,848 --> 01:01:21,849
and you know
that ain't right, Will.

1124
01:01:21,974 --> 01:01:23,642
I can't go nowhere.
I can't talk to nobody.

1125
01:01:23,767 --> 01:01:25,269
I'msorry. I-

1126
01:01:25,352 --> 01:01:28,063
There's nothin'
I can do right now.

1127
01:01:28,105 --> 01:01:29,857
Well, when can I come back?

1128
01:01:29,982 --> 01:01:31,275
Leo...

1129
01:01:31,316 --> 01:01:34,153
y- you gotta stay away
for a little longer, OK?

1130
01:01:34,278 --> 01:01:35,487
Well, how's my mother?

1131
01:01:35,571 --> 01:01:36,822
I wanted to call her,

1132
01:01:36,864 --> 01:01:38,073
but they probably
got the phones tapped.

1133
01:01:38,125 --> 01:01:40,033
Well,
did you see her?

1134
01:01:41,869 --> 01:01:43,162
Willie?

1135
01:01:45,706 --> 01:01:47,875
Yeah, I did.

1136
01:01:47,916 --> 01:01:50,419
Is she OK?

1137
01:01:50,544 --> 01:01:52,004
She's gonna be all right.

1138
01:01:52,045 --> 01:01:53,505
What do you mean?
What's wrong?

1139
01:01:53,589 --> 01:01:54,506
No, nothing.

1140
01:01:54,590 --> 01:01:57,551
The family's with her,
and she's OK.

1141
01:01:57,593 --> 01:02:00,387
Hey. I can hear it
in your fuckin' voice.

1142
01:02:00,512 --> 01:02:04,141
No, listen. Leo, listen.
Calm down, all right?

1143
01:02:04,224 --> 01:02:07,019
Look, I can't
talk right now,

1144
01:02:07,102 --> 01:02:09,897
but call me
back in a couple weeks.

1145
01:02:09,938 --> 01:02:11,482
And just know
that Frank's

1146
01:02:11,607 --> 01:02:13,525
tryin' to work
everything out, OK?

1147
01:02:15,903 --> 01:02:18,155
Leo?

1148
01:02:18,238 --> 01:02:19,531
You there?

1149
01:02:21,033 --> 01:02:22,201
Yeah, all right.

1150
01:02:47,976 --> 01:02:49,770
Is your mother up there?

1151
01:02:51,355 --> 01:02:53,941
What are you doing here?

1152
01:02:54,066 --> 01:02:55,776
Erica..
Want to get caught?

1153
01:02:58,612 --> 01:03:00,781
Police were here.

1154
01:03:00,864 --> 01:03:04,576
I know. I've been
watching 'em come and go.

1155
01:03:04,618 --> 01:03:08,038
I'll go around the back.

1156
01:03:08,163 --> 01:03:09,665
Let me in.

1157
01:03:11,083 --> 01:03:12,876
Go ahead.

1158
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:14,503
I need to see her.

1159
01:03:35,190 --> 01:03:36,191
Ma...

1160
01:03:38,819 --> 01:03:40,487
Ma...

1161
01:03:40,529 --> 01:03:41,572
you up?

1162
01:03:53,625 --> 01:03:55,544
How you feeling?

1163
01:04:01,717 --> 01:04:04,720
I just come by to see
how you were doing.

1164
01:04:14,938 --> 01:04:16,148
Ma...

1165
01:04:16,231 --> 01:04:19,359
I know I'm not
the son you wanted.

1166
01:04:24,156 --> 01:04:25,991
And I promised myself

1167
01:04:26,033 --> 01:04:29,453
that I would do whatever
I could to fit in.

1168
01:04:33,373 --> 01:04:34,833
What happened before,

1169
01:04:34,958 --> 01:04:36,543
I know I did wrong.

1170
01:04:36,668 --> 01:04:40,172
But I did not do what
they're sayin' that I did.

1171
01:04:45,093 --> 01:04:47,054
And I know...

1172
01:04:47,179 --> 01:04:50,390
I know that I'll never
be able to redeem myself.

1173
01:04:52,184 --> 01:04:54,394
But I just
wanted you to know.

1174
01:04:56,730 --> 01:04:58,857
It wasn't me, Mom.

1175
01:05:10,410 --> 01:05:11,495
I'm leavin' now.

1176
01:05:11,578 --> 01:05:14,373
I just wanted to see
how she was doin'.

1177
01:05:17,125 --> 01:05:18,168
Leo?

1178
01:05:21,421 --> 01:05:23,215
Was Willie with you?

1179
01:05:25,425 --> 01:05:26,844
At the yards?

1180
01:05:36,812 --> 01:05:39,064
It wasn't him, was it?

1181
01:06:13,182 --> 01:06:14,641
Hey...

1182
01:06:14,683 --> 01:06:17,644
you gotta
be strong now.

1183
01:06:17,686 --> 01:06:20,564
I know you guys
had plans.

1184
01:06:20,647 --> 01:06:21,899
We just gotta try

1185
01:06:21,982 --> 01:06:24,276
to find a way
through this.

1186
01:06:24,318 --> 01:06:26,570
And we're gonna get
through this, OK?

1187
01:06:29,781 --> 01:06:30,908
Come on.

1188
01:06:38,373 --> 01:06:39,958
Thanks for
lookin' after her.

1189
01:06:40,083 --> 01:06:41,585
Yeah.

1190
01:06:41,668 --> 01:06:42,920
I'll come back
tomorrow.

1191
01:06:43,003 --> 01:06:45,589
Get the doctor
to come see her, OK?

1192
01:06:56,809 --> 01:06:58,602
Mr. Olchin, sorry to
interrupt your meeting.

1193
01:06:58,685 --> 01:06:59,603
Detective Tommasino.

1194
01:06:59,686 --> 01:07:00,604
How you doin'?

1195
01:07:00,687 --> 01:07:01,647
Detective Bulette.

1196
01:07:01,688 --> 01:07:02,940
Pleasure. What can
I do for you fellas?

1197
01:07:03,023 --> 01:07:03,941
I'd like you
to look at this.

1198
01:07:04,024 --> 01:07:05,609
I want to ask you
a few questions.

1199
01:07:05,692 --> 01:07:06,610
Oh, him. Yeah.

1200
01:07:06,693 --> 01:07:07,736
Do you have
any knowledge

1201
01:07:07,861 --> 01:07:08,946
as to his
whereabouts?

1202
01:07:09,029 --> 01:07:11,615
I only met him
a couple of times.

1203
01:07:11,698 --> 01:07:13,325
Wife says he's
a troubled kid.

1204
01:07:13,408 --> 01:07:14,701
He was not
in your employ?

1205
01:07:14,743 --> 01:07:16,161
Oh, no.

1206
01:07:16,203 --> 01:07:17,746
Bulette.. We spoke
to your secretary,

1207
01:07:17,871 --> 01:07:19,331
and she said
he came by to see you.

1208
01:07:19,414 --> 01:07:21,166
Yeah, right. Uh,
he was lookin' for ajob,

1209
01:07:21,208 --> 01:07:23,794
but, uh, I didn't
have anything for him.

1210
01:07:25,712 --> 01:07:27,256
You will
contactus in the event

1211
01:07:27,381 --> 01:07:29,132
that you gain any
additional information?

1212
01:07:29,216 --> 01:07:30,467
Oh, sure. Absolutely, yes.

1213
01:07:30,551 --> 01:07:32,261
Thank you
for your time.

1214
01:07:32,344 --> 01:07:33,262
Thank you.

1215
01:07:33,345 --> 01:07:34,263
Thanks.

1216
01:07:40,227 --> 01:07:42,646
Seymour,
what'd you find out?

1217
01:07:42,729 --> 01:07:44,148
There's
gonna be a hearing

1218
01:07:44,231 --> 01:07:46,692
about that yardmaster
who got killed.

1219
01:07:46,775 --> 01:07:49,069
There's somethin' else,
too, Frank.

1220
01:07:49,153 --> 01:07:51,738
I talked to the division
captain last night.

1221
01:07:51,864 --> 01:07:53,782
He says there's no way.

1222
01:07:53,907 --> 01:07:55,993
The cop is straight.

1223
01:07:56,076 --> 01:07:57,995
There's no chance he's gonna
go under the table for us.

1224
01:07:58,078 --> 01:07:58,996
Well, Jesus Christ.

1225
01:07:59,079 --> 01:08:00,664
Can't, uh, Mydanick
help us out here?

1226
01:08:00,747 --> 01:08:01,999
What do you mean,
"help"?

1227
01:08:02,082 --> 01:08:04,042
The kid's a murderer.

1228
01:08:04,168 --> 01:08:06,795
What'd the cops
say to you?

1229
01:08:06,879 --> 01:08:10,007
What- what do you think?
They're lookin' for him.

1230
01:08:11,258 --> 01:08:12,801
Maybe you
should think about

1231
01:08:12,926 --> 01:08:14,469
gettin' him
before they do.

1232
01:08:16,096 --> 01:08:16,972
What?

1233
01:08:17,097 --> 01:08:18,974
Make sure
he don't turn up.

1234
01:08:21,977 --> 01:08:26,190
What are we talkin'
about here, Seymour?

1235
01:08:26,273 --> 01:08:28,609
I mean, w-what
do you think I am?

1236
01:08:29,776 --> 01:08:32,321
I'm just sayin'
this is a real priority

1237
01:08:32,446 --> 01:08:34,615
for the borough
president right here.

1238
01:08:34,698 --> 01:08:35,991
He doesn't want us

1239
01:08:36,033 --> 01:08:37,993
to all end up
like Donnie Manes.

1240
01:08:39,495 --> 01:08:40,996
Yeah, well...

1241
01:08:41,038 --> 01:08:43,707
you guys are gonna
just have to think

1242
01:08:43,749 --> 01:08:46,502
of somethin' else,
'cause...

1243
01:08:46,627 --> 01:08:48,837
I could never do
nothin' like that.

1244
01:08:52,216 --> 01:08:54,927
Fuckin' kid is, uh,
is in my family.

1245
01:08:58,472 --> 01:09:00,432
Make sure
he don't turn up.

1246
01:09:05,020 --> 01:09:07,606
Is there anything
more we can be doing, Doctor?

1247
01:09:07,731 --> 01:09:08,816
I have heron digoxin,

1248
01:09:08,857 --> 01:09:10,108
so we'll have to watch.

1249
01:09:10,234 --> 01:09:12,361
Ah, is there a number?
I need to get your number.

1250
01:09:13,445 --> 01:09:14,363
Take care.

1251
01:09:14,446 --> 01:09:15,656
OK, thanks.

1252
01:09:15,739 --> 01:09:17,032
Hi, Mrs. Olchin.

1253
01:09:17,074 --> 01:09:18,116
Hey, sweetheart.

1254
01:09:18,242 --> 01:09:19,827
Your brother said
you'd be here.

1255
01:09:19,952 --> 01:09:21,370
I've been
calling you all day.

1256
01:09:21,453 --> 01:09:22,454
Ma.

1257
01:09:22,579 --> 01:09:24,373
I'll go inside.

1258
01:09:30,170 --> 01:09:31,171
Where you been?

1259
01:09:32,339 --> 01:09:33,590
I been here.

1260
01:09:34,675 --> 01:09:36,093
I know that.

1261
01:09:36,176 --> 01:09:38,971
How come you don't
call me back?

1262
01:09:39,054 --> 01:09:41,974
There's just a lot
goin' on right now.

1263
01:09:46,687 --> 01:09:49,189
Does your mother
got a problem with me?

1264
01:09:51,567 --> 01:09:53,694
I don't know. No.

1265
01:09:55,070 --> 01:09:56,989
'Cause I saw the way
she looked at me

1266
01:09:57,072 --> 01:09:59,032
when you told her
we were gonna get married.

1267
01:10:01,076 --> 01:10:02,786
I think
you should go.

1268
01:10:02,870 --> 01:10:05,122
I want to talk to you.

1269
01:10:07,207 --> 01:10:09,126
I don't have
anything to say.

1270
01:10:10,711 --> 01:10:12,004
Erica.

1271
01:10:13,213 --> 01:10:16,300
Is it- is this 'cause
of what happened with Leo?

1272
01:10:16,383 --> 01:10:17,634
'Cause...

1273
01:10:17,718 --> 01:10:19,219
I'm goin'
back inside now.

1274
01:10:19,344 --> 01:10:21,305
No, Erica, wait.
I want to talk to you.

1275
01:10:21,388 --> 01:10:22,681
Erica, listen.

1276
01:10:22,723 --> 01:10:24,016
Erica!

1277
01:10:25,934 --> 01:10:27,478
Fuck.

1278
01:10:50,542 --> 01:10:52,127
I got a hearing
coming up

1279
01:10:52,252 --> 01:10:53,462
with the, uh,
with the city.

1280
01:10:53,545 --> 01:10:55,130
It'd be nice
if you came with me

1281
01:10:55,255 --> 01:10:56,840
for a little
support.

1282
01:10:56,924 --> 01:10:58,008
OK.

1283
01:11:01,970 --> 01:11:03,847
How's your sister?

1284
01:11:07,768 --> 01:11:10,270
What's
the matter, honey?

1285
01:11:10,395 --> 01:11:14,233
I saw Leo tonight...
outside the apartment.

1286
01:11:19,404 --> 01:11:21,698
You saw Leo tonight?

1287
01:11:22,950 --> 01:11:26,036
He's gonna wind up getting
all of us into trouble.

1288
01:11:29,706 --> 01:11:31,959
You told me
he wasn't comin' back.

1289
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,169
I was just there
tonight.

1290
01:11:34,211 --> 01:11:35,170
He was there?

1291
01:11:35,212 --> 01:11:37,172
Yeah. He was there.

1292
01:11:39,591 --> 01:11:42,094
We gotta deal
with it right now.

1293
01:11:42,219 --> 01:11:44,888
Well, what do you
want me to do?

1294
01:11:47,808 --> 01:11:51,103
My wife is, uh...

1295
01:11:51,145 --> 01:11:53,981
Very upset.

1296
01:11:54,022 --> 01:11:56,233
I mean, Erica's been
spendin' a lot of time

1297
01:11:56,316 --> 01:11:58,777
over there with Leo,
and, you know,

1298
01:11:58,902 --> 01:12:01,029
she doesn't like 'em
being together, uh,

1299
01:12:01,113 --> 01:12:04,283
because of what happened
between the two of 'em.

1300
01:12:05,409 --> 01:12:06,785
What do you mean?

1301
01:12:09,329 --> 01:12:10,747
You don't know.

1302
01:12:16,753 --> 01:12:19,798
She caught 'em together
when they were 15.

1303
01:12:23,427 --> 01:12:25,137
I never knew that.

1304
01:12:30,726 --> 01:12:33,228
You know, I found some
letters from him to her,

1305
01:12:33,270 --> 01:12:36,023
but, uh, I never
thought that...

1306
01:12:46,575 --> 01:12:47,826
I don't know.

1307
01:12:49,244 --> 01:12:52,831
I wish there was some way
to take care of this.

1308
01:13:23,403 --> 01:13:24,988
What are you doing here?

1309
01:13:27,908 --> 01:13:28,867
Willie?

1310
01:13:38,043 --> 01:13:40,379
I just came by
to see my mother.

1311
01:13:43,924 --> 01:13:45,384
To see your mother.

1312
01:13:49,596 --> 01:13:51,515
You're not supposed
to be here.

1313
01:13:51,598 --> 01:13:53,100
He went
up to the roof

1314
01:13:53,225 --> 01:13:54,434
to see if it
was safe to leave.

1315
01:13:54,518 --> 01:13:55,435
Shut up.

1316
01:14:01,024 --> 01:14:02,860
Why'd you come back?

1317
01:14:05,529 --> 01:14:09,408
You fucked
every thing up.

1318
01:14:09,449 --> 01:14:10,742
Willie,
just let him get-

1319
01:14:12,119 --> 01:14:13,245
What the fuck?!

1320
01:14:13,328 --> 01:14:15,080
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

1321
01:14:15,122 --> 01:14:16,832
No! Let me go!

1322
01:14:22,171 --> 01:14:23,130
Unh!

1323
01:14:24,173 --> 01:14:26,258
You-
You fucking-

1324
01:14:50,073 --> 01:14:50,949
Come on!

1325
01:15:04,087 --> 01:15:05,005
Come on, Will.

1326
01:15:05,088 --> 01:15:06,006
Fucker!

1327
01:15:06,089 --> 01:15:07,799
- Come on!
- Motherfucker!

1328
01:15:15,098 --> 01:15:16,308
Motherfucker!

1329
01:15:24,233 --> 01:15:27,110
It's over, Will.
No more.

1330
01:15:34,535 --> 01:15:36,995
You fucked me, Will!

1331
01:15:37,037 --> 01:15:38,121
You fucked me!

1332
01:15:52,386 --> 01:15:54,346
Shh.

1333
01:15:57,641 --> 01:15:59,518
Shh.

1334
01:16:20,956 --> 01:16:22,040
Frank?

1335
01:16:34,595 --> 01:16:36,889
Jesus.
What happened to you?

1336
01:16:38,599 --> 01:16:41,393
Did your mother
see you like that?

1337
01:16:50,986 --> 01:16:53,238
I know I haven't
always given you

1338
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:55,491
as much respect
as maybe I should've.

1339
01:16:55,532 --> 01:16:58,494
And I haven't
given you a chance

1340
01:16:58,535 --> 01:17:01,413
to be a father
to me and my brother.

1341
01:17:03,207 --> 01:17:05,000
And I'm sorry...

1342
01:17:10,756 --> 01:17:12,925
'cause I know how much
that means to you,

1343
01:17:13,008 --> 01:17:14,718
how hard you've tried.

1344
01:17:16,220 --> 01:17:19,515
But I hope
you can forgive me.

1345
01:17:19,556 --> 01:17:21,809
'Cause it's been hard
for me, too.

1346
01:17:27,523 --> 01:17:30,025
I loved my father very much.

1347
01:17:35,489 --> 01:17:38,450
And we were all
very close as a family.

1348
01:17:44,164 --> 01:17:46,583
That's why
I'm asking you now.

1349
01:17:51,547 --> 01:17:53,757
Leo needs your help.

1350
01:17:56,760 --> 01:17:59,638
He wants to see you.

1351
01:17:59,763 --> 01:18:01,640
I told him you would.

1352
01:18:01,765 --> 01:18:03,642
Please.

1353
01:18:09,815 --> 01:18:10,858
Please.

1354
01:18:26,331 --> 01:18:27,499
Where is he?

1355
01:18:29,877 --> 01:18:31,336
I could take you.

1356
01:18:36,133 --> 01:18:38,010
Go out to the car.

1357
01:19:06,663 --> 01:19:07,664
Leo?

1358
01:19:08,749 --> 01:19:10,918
Yeah, over here.

1359
01:19:22,095 --> 01:19:25,682
You know, you been causing me
a lot of difficulty.

1360
01:19:25,766 --> 01:19:27,476
Police been coming
to see me.

1361
01:19:28,602 --> 01:19:30,729
I need you to help me.

1362
01:19:30,771 --> 01:19:34,191
What is it
you think I could do?

1363
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:37,778
I really don't know.

1364
01:19:37,861 --> 01:19:39,154
I thought maybe
you could talk

1365
01:19:39,196 --> 01:19:40,447
to some of them
people you know,

1366
01:19:40,572 --> 01:19:41,865
'cause I didn't
kill anybody.

1367
01:19:41,949 --> 01:19:44,493
Do you have
any idea who did?

1368
01:19:53,710 --> 01:19:55,420
I...

1369
01:19:58,173 --> 01:20:00,092
I wish I could
help you, Leo.

1370
01:20:00,175 --> 01:20:01,885
I- I really do.

1371
01:20:01,969 --> 01:20:04,075
But, uh, I gotta
do what I can

1372
01:20:04,127 --> 01:20:06,181
to protect
what I've built.

1373
01:20:06,473 --> 01:20:10,227
You know, for my family.

1374
01:20:10,310 --> 01:20:13,105
'Cause, uh,
that's all I got left.

1375
01:20:20,487 --> 01:20:22,489
Leo.

1376
01:21:13,373 --> 01:21:14,333
Leo?

1377
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:18,754
You take care of yourself.

1378
01:21:21,798 --> 01:21:23,206
I can't stay, Ma.

1379
01:21:23,258 --> 01:21:25,761
Too many people
know I'm here.

1380
01:21:26,094 --> 01:21:29,807
They're all
against me now.

1381
01:21:29,890 --> 01:21:30,974
I know.

1382
01:21:35,896 --> 01:21:39,191
I'm sorry it was always
just the two of us.

1383
01:21:44,780 --> 01:21:47,282
Always having to deal
with every thing ourselves.

1384
01:21:48,283 --> 01:21:51,703
I never
needed nobody else anyway.

1385
01:21:55,707 --> 01:21:57,167
You never had...

1386
01:22:04,591 --> 01:22:07,094
someone to look to, though.

1387
01:22:13,225 --> 01:22:15,394
I used to look
at those business people

1388
01:22:15,435 --> 01:22:19,815
all dressed up,
goin' to the city.

1389
01:22:19,940 --> 01:22:23,026
I always hoped
you could be one of them.

1390
01:22:23,110 --> 01:22:25,821
You'd look good
in one of those suits.

1391
01:22:29,950 --> 01:22:32,244
Yeah, but...

1392
01:22:32,286 --> 01:22:34,121
who knows
what they do, huh?

1393
01:22:38,125 --> 01:22:39,376
I love you, Ma.

1394
01:22:42,129 --> 01:22:43,714
Don't lose faith.

1395
01:22:50,971 --> 01:22:54,057
I'll stay a little
longer tonight, OK?

1396
01:22:54,141 --> 01:22:55,476
OK.

1397
01:22:57,811 --> 01:22:59,062
I'm gonna be good.

1398
01:23:05,068 --> 01:23:08,363
I'm gonna go get
the rest of my things.

1399
01:24:42,666 --> 01:24:43,542
Ma.

1400
01:24:43,667 --> 01:24:44,543
Hmm?

1401
01:24:44,668 --> 01:24:46,253
Ma.

1402
01:24:46,378 --> 01:24:48,755
Ma, I gotta take you down
to the neighbors' right now.

1403
01:26:32,651 --> 01:26:33,610
Aah!

1404
01:26:50,502 --> 01:26:53,380
You're gonna tell Willie
I know he sent you.

1405
01:26:53,505 --> 01:26:54,798
And you're
gonna tell him

1406
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:56,717
he better start looking
over his fuckin' back.

1407
01:26:57,801 --> 01:26:59,303
Hey.

1408
01:27:03,015 --> 01:27:04,308
Look at me.

1409
01:27:07,102 --> 01:27:10,022
I could get every one
of you fuckin' guys.

1410
01:27:11,815 --> 01:27:13,525
I could, too.
I'm gonna.

1411
01:27:20,324 --> 01:27:21,200
Don't.

1412
01:27:21,325 --> 01:27:23,535
Don't, please.

1413
01:27:24,828 --> 01:27:25,954
Get up!

1414
01:27:37,633 --> 01:27:39,343
Get us the fuck
out of here!

1415
01:27:39,426 --> 01:27:40,385
Did you do it?

1416
01:27:40,469 --> 01:27:41,637
Go!

1417
01:27:50,938 --> 01:27:53,023
Hundreds of city residents are expected

1418
01:27:53,148 --> 01:27:55,067
to turn out at a public hearing
in Queens tonight

1419
01:27:55,150 --> 01:27:57,069
to discuss charges
of corruption and payoffs

1420
01:27:57,152 --> 01:27:59,071
in the commuter
rail industry.

1421
01:27:59,154 --> 01:28:00,656
Queensborough President
Arthur Mydanick

1422
01:28:00,739 --> 01:28:02,658
called the meeting
amid criticism his office

1423
01:28:02,741 --> 01:28:03,909
isn't doing enough
to help resolve

1424
01:28:03,961 --> 01:28:05,369
this escalating scandal.

1425
01:28:05,702 --> 01:28:08,413
It may lead to the indictment
of local politicians

1426
01:28:08,455 --> 01:28:10,040
and rail industry
executives.

1427
01:28:10,165 --> 01:28:12,084
The controversy
was sparked last month

1428
01:28:12,167 --> 01:28:14,670
when MCT yardmaster
Elliot Gorwitz was killed

1429
01:28:14,753 --> 01:28:16,755
and police officer
Gerald Rifkin was injured

1430
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:19,591
in an attack at
the Sunnyside yards in Queens.

1431
01:28:19,675 --> 01:28:21,885
Since the attack, there have
been several protests,

1432
01:28:21,927 --> 01:28:23,262
including last week's
demonstration

1433
01:28:23,387 --> 01:28:25,597
in midtown Manhattan
that turned violent.

1434
01:28:25,681 --> 01:28:27,182
In all,
29 people were arrested

1435
01:28:27,307 --> 01:28:29,184
for assault
and disorderly conduct.

1436
01:28:29,226 --> 01:28:31,687
Meantime, police are still
looking for Leo Handler,

1437
01:28:31,770 --> 01:28:33,981
the only suspect
in the Gorwitz murder.

1438
01:28:48,412 --> 01:28:50,789
Frank is very concerned,
Willie.

1439
01:28:50,831 --> 01:28:52,624
I just talked to him.

1440
01:28:52,708 --> 01:28:54,001
He asked me
to handle this with you,

1441
01:28:54,042 --> 01:28:55,210
find out how it went.

1442
01:28:57,671 --> 01:29:01,049
We had a little,
um, a little problem.

1443
01:29:01,101 --> 01:29:04,303
But we're gonna
go back again.

1444
01:29:06,263 --> 01:29:08,140
You got this
under control?

1445
01:29:12,144 --> 01:29:14,855
What, um, what time's
the hearing?

1446
01:29:15,230 --> 01:29:17,441
I don't know if you're gonna
be coming to the hearing.

1447
01:29:17,524 --> 01:29:19,151
Why not?

1448
01:29:19,234 --> 01:29:20,819
Frank and I
discussed it.

1449
01:29:20,944 --> 01:29:22,279
Uh, we don't think
it's such a good idea

1450
01:29:22,362 --> 01:29:24,260
for you to come,
you know,

1451
01:29:24,312 --> 01:29:26,158
because of
the investigation.

1452
01:29:30,746 --> 01:29:32,539
Frank doesn't think
I should come?

1453
01:29:33,832 --> 01:29:35,459
You know how it is.

1454
01:29:36,752 --> 01:29:38,118
Yeah.

1455
01:29:38,170 --> 01:29:39,963
Frank also
wanted me to tell you

1456
01:29:40,047 --> 01:29:41,965
that, uh,
he doesn't want you

1457
01:29:42,049 --> 01:29:44,092
calling the house
anymore.

1458
01:29:44,176 --> 01:29:46,970
And, uh, you got
the housekeys, right?

1459
01:29:49,389 --> 01:29:51,058
Yeah.

1460
01:29:51,099 --> 01:29:52,601
He wants 'em back.

1461
01:29:55,395 --> 01:29:56,396
OK?

1462
01:29:59,191 --> 01:30:03,070
Well, uh, I don't have them
on me now, right now.

1463
01:30:03,403 --> 01:30:04,696
That's all right.

1464
01:30:04,738 --> 01:30:06,532
Drop 'em off
as soon as you can.

1465
01:30:06,573 --> 01:30:08,534
He's a little worried
about security,

1466
01:30:08,575 --> 01:30:09,535
that's all.

1467
01:30:10,577 --> 01:30:12,079
See you later, Willie.

1468
01:30:28,595 --> 01:30:29,638
Hello, Weltech.

1469
01:30:29,763 --> 01:30:31,056
Hector Gallardo, please.

1470
01:30:31,098 --> 01:30:32,641
Yes,
just a minute, please.

1471
01:30:33,767 --> 01:30:34,601
Hello?

1472
01:30:34,726 --> 01:30:37,604
Hector, it's
Willie Gutierrez.

1473
01:30:37,646 --> 01:30:38,897
You're too late.

1474
01:30:57,332 --> 01:30:58,959
Well,
the purpose of the, uh,

1475
01:30:59,042 --> 01:31:00,252
the purpose of this meeting
is to let things air,

1476
01:31:00,335 --> 01:31:01,378
give people a voice,

1477
01:31:01,461 --> 01:31:02,754
and to announce
our investigation.

1478
01:31:02,838 --> 01:31:05,132
And, uh, any more quotes
you'll get later, OK?

1479
01:31:05,174 --> 01:31:07,134
Hold- Hold that for me.
Seymour?

1480
01:31:15,350 --> 01:31:16,268
Hiya, Frank.

1481
01:31:16,351 --> 01:31:17,269
How you been?
All right?

1482
01:31:17,352 --> 01:31:18,270
- Fine.
- Good.

1483
01:31:19,938 --> 01:31:21,565
Move one over, sweetie.

1484
01:31:25,652 --> 01:31:26,904
You speak to Willie?

1485
01:31:26,945 --> 01:31:27,946
Yeah.

1486
01:31:28,071 --> 01:31:30,949
He's still, uh,
taking care of the problem.

1487
01:31:30,991 --> 01:31:32,951
But you won't have
to worry about him anymore.

1488
01:31:32,993 --> 01:31:34,870
I told him
to keep his distance.

1489
01:31:34,953 --> 01:31:36,580
Good. Where's Sequiera?

1490
01:31:36,663 --> 01:31:38,123
I haven't seen him.

1491
01:31:38,165 --> 01:31:39,958
But I'm sure he
and the Weltech people,

1492
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,585
they probably want to make
some kind of big entrance.

1493
01:31:41,668 --> 01:31:42,628
Yeah.

1494
01:31:45,714 --> 01:31:47,591
That's- that's enough.
Thank you.

1495
01:31:50,511 --> 01:31:51,470
Thank you.

1496
01:32:03,232 --> 01:32:04,942
Frank, turn around.

1497
01:32:17,871 --> 01:32:20,499
My God,
what is he doing here?

1498
01:32:32,344 --> 01:32:34,805
Mr. Handler is willing
to turn himself in

1499
01:32:34,930 --> 01:32:37,724
after these proceedings.
You have my assurances.

1500
01:32:43,272 --> 01:32:46,066
Tell the borough
we need to talk now.

1501
01:32:46,118 --> 01:32:47,526
And I want Mydanick.

1502
01:32:47,734 --> 01:32:50,028
Make sure he understands
I want him.

1503
01:33:03,167 --> 01:33:05,669
All right,
let's make this quick.

1504
01:33:05,752 --> 01:33:09,465
We, uh, we got
a new problem out there.

1505
01:33:09,506 --> 01:33:11,467
"We"? What do
you mean, "we"?

1506
01:33:11,508 --> 01:33:13,302
He's your nephew.

1507
01:33:13,385 --> 01:33:15,179
You're on your own
here, Frank.

1508
01:33:16,722 --> 01:33:18,682
You throwing me
to the wolves, jerk-off?

1509
01:33:18,724 --> 01:33:20,684
I got records.
I got copies

1510
01:33:20,726 --> 01:33:22,394
of every check that
went from me to you,

1511
01:33:22,478 --> 01:33:26,190
that bought your fuckin'
house in sands point.

1512
01:33:26,273 --> 01:33:28,275
So, let's not
play games, OK?

1513
01:34:12,444 --> 01:34:15,197
What are we
talking about here?

1514
01:34:15,249 --> 01:34:17,950
I mean,
there was a murder.

1515
01:34:17,991 --> 01:34:19,785
A man lost his life.

1516
01:34:19,827 --> 01:34:22,454
You can't bargain
with a man's life.

1517
01:34:22,538 --> 01:34:25,624
And this man over here-
this man has been

1518
01:34:25,749 --> 01:34:27,334
wrongly accused
of the crime.

1519
01:34:27,376 --> 01:34:28,877
OK, all right, look.

1520
01:34:29,002 --> 01:34:30,838
Why are you
tellin' me this?

1521
01:34:30,879 --> 01:34:32,631
Y- you're talkin'
about my nephew here.

1522
01:34:32,756 --> 01:34:34,925
And I'm gonna do
everything I can to help him.

1523
01:34:35,008 --> 01:34:35,968
So, now, uh...

1524
01:34:36,051 --> 01:34:37,970
you think we can
all agree on something

1525
01:34:38,011 --> 01:34:40,264
that would make
every body happy?

1526
01:34:40,347 --> 01:34:42,766
I don't know, Frank.

1527
01:34:42,850 --> 01:34:45,102
Your nephew here has
a lot of things to say

1528
01:34:45,144 --> 01:34:46,145
about
the way your company

1529
01:34:46,270 --> 01:34:47,271
conducts its business.

1530
01:34:47,354 --> 01:34:48,897
I think
everybody out there

1531
01:34:49,022 --> 01:34:50,607
has a right to hear it.

1532
01:34:50,649 --> 01:34:51,515
Manny, come on.

1533
01:34:51,567 --> 01:34:53,694
What good is that
gonna do anybody, huh?

1534
01:34:54,027 --> 01:34:56,864
Can't we, uh, can't
we resolve this nice?

1535
01:34:56,905 --> 01:34:58,282
I don't think
you understand.

1536
01:34:58,365 --> 01:35:01,869
For a long time
we have been kept down

1537
01:35:01,994 --> 01:35:03,871
by this man
and these people.

1538
01:35:03,912 --> 01:35:05,581
And I think
it is about time

1539
01:35:05,664 --> 01:35:07,291
for a little
retribution.

1540
01:35:07,374 --> 01:35:09,418
Don't you think so?

1541
01:35:17,509 --> 01:35:18,469
Hello?

1542
01:35:33,901 --> 01:35:35,694
What are you doing here?

1543
01:35:35,736 --> 01:35:38,322
I came to drop off
the keys.

1544
01:35:39,531 --> 01:35:41,825
I thought you'd be
at the hearing.

1545
01:35:41,867 --> 01:35:43,827
I was at school.

1546
01:35:45,120 --> 01:35:47,915
If you're looking for Leo,
I don't know where he is.

1547
01:35:47,956 --> 01:35:50,000
I'm not looking
for Leo.

1548
01:35:50,125 --> 01:35:52,127
I know where he is.

1549
01:35:55,088 --> 01:35:57,549
Artie. Seymour said
you wanted to see me.

1550
01:35:57,633 --> 01:35:59,134
Yeah, come on in, Sal.

1551
01:35:59,218 --> 01:36:02,346
This is Deputy Chief Disipio
from police plaza.

1552
01:36:02,429 --> 01:36:03,764
How do you do?

1553
01:36:03,847 --> 01:36:06,141
Sal, we got a little bit
of a problem here.

1554
01:36:06,183 --> 01:36:07,559
Maybe you could
help us out, huh?

1555
01:36:07,643 --> 01:36:09,061
Of course.
Anything for you, Artie.

1556
01:36:09,144 --> 01:36:12,064
We all think that your
Officer Rifkin out there

1557
01:36:12,147 --> 01:36:13,941
is a little confused.

1558
01:36:14,066 --> 01:36:15,067
Oh, is that right?

1559
01:36:15,192 --> 01:36:16,652
Yeah, that's right.

1560
01:36:16,693 --> 01:36:20,739
This young man here,
this is not your guy.

1561
01:36:20,864 --> 01:36:23,242
Look, Sal,
we understand the suffering

1562
01:36:23,367 --> 01:36:25,244
that Officer Rifkin
has been through,

1563
01:36:25,369 --> 01:36:27,788
and we're willing to
compensate him for it, you know.

1564
01:36:27,871 --> 01:36:30,874
Of course, we'd present you
with the remuneration,

1565
01:36:30,958 --> 01:36:32,668
and, uh...

1566
01:36:32,751 --> 01:36:37,673
you could distribute it
however you see fit.

1567
01:36:37,714 --> 01:36:39,508
So...

1568
01:36:39,591 --> 01:36:41,385
Disipio.. you've been
wrongly accused?

1569
01:36:41,468 --> 01:36:43,595
Yes, I have been.
And I could help you

1570
01:36:43,679 --> 01:36:45,681
with that murder,
'cause I know who did it.

1571
01:36:45,764 --> 01:36:47,130
Oh, yeah?

1572
01:36:47,182 --> 01:36:49,393
And you'd be willing
to testify to that?

1573
01:36:49,685 --> 01:36:51,603
Yes, I will.

1574
01:36:51,687 --> 01:36:53,939
I would, definitely.

1575
01:36:57,484 --> 01:36:59,611
Well, I think that we
might be able to solve

1576
01:36:59,695 --> 01:37:01,697
a lot of your problems.

1577
01:37:01,780 --> 01:37:03,782
Rifkin issupposed
to be a real-by-the-booker.

1578
01:37:03,907 --> 01:37:05,784
Yeah, he can be
a hard-ass,

1579
01:37:05,826 --> 01:37:07,786
but he also can get
a little carried away

1580
01:37:07,828 --> 01:37:09,913
with the nightstick,
and you and I both know

1581
01:37:09,997 --> 01:37:11,623
he wouldn't want any
of that to come out.

1582
01:37:11,707 --> 01:37:13,709
No.

1583
01:37:13,792 --> 01:37:16,336
Well, Manny, looks like
it's really up to you now.

1584
01:37:20,340 --> 01:37:22,217
I just want 20 percent.

1585
01:37:24,011 --> 01:37:26,805
Of all the contracts.

1586
01:37:28,640 --> 01:37:31,518
Yeah.

1587
01:37:31,643 --> 01:37:33,812
That's fair.

1588
01:37:33,937 --> 01:37:36,023
I guess that's fair.

1589
01:37:40,819 --> 01:37:43,103
Leo was smart.

1590
01:37:43,155 --> 01:37:46,533
He did what I should have
done from the beginning.

1591
01:37:46,575 --> 01:37:50,037
it's a little
late for that now.

1592
01:37:51,330 --> 01:37:54,750
I'm sure you'll be OK.

1593
01:37:55,083 --> 01:37:57,294
Yeah?

1594
01:37:57,336 --> 01:37:59,755
Seems like every one's
trying to cut me out.

1595
01:37:59,838 --> 01:38:01,548
I can't help you.

1596
01:38:01,590 --> 01:38:03,842
Erica, wait.

1597
01:38:03,967 --> 01:38:05,093
Erica, wait!

1598
01:38:11,683 --> 01:38:13,268
Willie, stop!

1599
01:38:16,396 --> 01:38:19,274
Shh, shh.

1600
01:38:19,316 --> 01:38:21,985
I love you, Erica.

1601
01:38:22,027 --> 01:38:24,488
I'm so sorry.

1602
01:38:28,200 --> 01:38:30,869
Don't run away
from me, please.

1603
01:38:30,911 --> 01:38:32,996
You're all I have now.

1604
01:38:39,795 --> 01:38:42,047
I love you so much.

1605
01:38:53,517 --> 01:38:56,311
Where you going?
Huh?

1606
01:38:58,564 --> 01:38:59,690
Come here.

1607
01:39:02,526 --> 01:39:05,112
You going to see
fucking Leo?!

1608
01:39:05,237 --> 01:39:08,115
You know how sick that is,
the two of you,

1609
01:39:08,240 --> 01:39:10,534
how fucking sick?

1610
01:39:10,617 --> 01:39:12,661
No!

1611
01:39:17,875 --> 01:39:19,334
No!

1612
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:24,381
No!

1613
01:39:25,466 --> 01:39:28,969
Leave me alone!

1614
01:39:42,608 --> 01:39:44,943
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen,

1615
01:39:44,985 --> 01:39:46,778
Deputy Chief Disipio,

1616
01:39:46,862 --> 01:39:50,157
and honored members
of our police force.

1617
01:39:50,199 --> 01:39:51,731
I want you all to know

1618
01:39:51,783 --> 01:39:54,161
that I have demanded
an internal investigation

1619
01:39:54,453 --> 01:39:57,873
unprecedented
in scope and rigor.

1620
01:39:57,956 --> 01:39:59,374
Now, I know
many things can divide us

1621
01:39:59,458 --> 01:40:01,418
here in this borough
and in this community,

1622
01:40:01,502 --> 01:40:03,504
but your showing up
here tonight

1623
01:40:03,629 --> 01:40:06,256
indicates confidence
in our system.

1624
01:40:06,298 --> 01:40:08,258
Our internal investigation,

1625
01:40:08,310 --> 01:40:10,219
which will be aired
next week,

1626
01:40:10,302 --> 01:40:12,805
will show that the claims
of concerned citizens,

1627
01:40:12,930 --> 01:40:15,474
as well as the claims
of some of our media,

1628
01:40:15,526 --> 01:40:17,392
are totally unfounded.

1629
01:40:17,684 --> 01:40:20,270
Our investigation concludes

1630
01:40:20,395 --> 01:40:23,315
the suspect that we have
been following for some time

1631
01:40:23,367 --> 01:40:26,777
should be cleared
immediately of all charges.

1632
01:40:26,819 --> 01:40:28,320
Oh, please.

1633
01:40:29,446 --> 01:40:31,240
Not again.

1634
01:40:31,323 --> 01:40:32,741
Now, please,

1635
01:40:32,825 --> 01:40:34,409
ladies and gentlemen,
please...

1636
01:41:15,534 --> 01:41:17,161
Officer.. Excuse me, sir?

1637
01:41:17,244 --> 01:41:19,204
We have a report of
an alarm at this location.

1638
01:41:19,246 --> 01:41:21,039
Can I see your
license, registration,

1639
01:41:21,165 --> 01:41:22,666
and insurance card, please?

1640
01:41:25,169 --> 01:41:26,837
Sir?

1641
01:41:31,049 --> 01:41:32,467
Get out of the car.

1642
01:41:32,519 --> 01:41:33,886
Get out of the car!

1643
01:41:33,938 --> 01:41:34,887
Unh!

1644
01:41:35,012 --> 01:41:37,473
Go call for backup.
Get backup.

1645
01:41:37,514 --> 01:41:38,765
You got it.

1646
01:41:40,017 --> 01:41:42,394
What were you doing
in there, huh?

1647
01:41:42,478 --> 01:41:44,021
Got anything on you?

1648
01:41:49,902 --> 01:41:51,351
As I was saying,

1649
01:41:51,403 --> 01:41:53,780
our report, which will be
made public next week,

1650
01:41:53,906 --> 01:41:56,074
will show that we have
a great deal of violence

1651
01:41:56,200 --> 01:41:57,618
and vandalism
in our subways.

1652
01:41:57,701 --> 01:41:59,912
Now, we've made
an unfailing commitment

1653
01:41:59,995 --> 01:42:02,362
to all of our public
transportation systems.

1654
01:42:02,414 --> 01:42:04,917
We cannot let the violence
of a few of these hooligans

1655
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:06,585
tear at the fabric
of our great city.

1656
01:42:06,710 --> 01:42:08,587
I know that
everyone of our hearts

1657
01:42:08,712 --> 01:42:10,130
goes out to the family
of the late Mr. Gorwitz.

1658
01:42:10,255 --> 01:42:12,382
Mr. Gorwitz's murder
is a true tragedy.

1659
01:42:12,424 --> 01:42:13,801
Move aside.

1660
01:42:13,926 --> 01:42:14,885
We've shown
time and time again

1661
01:42:15,010 --> 01:42:17,137
that we can come together.

1662
01:42:17,221 --> 01:42:18,889
And as I look around
the room this evening,

1663
01:42:18,931 --> 01:42:20,766
Isee that we-

1664
01:42:20,808 --> 01:42:22,267
Mr. And Mrs. Olchin?

1665
01:42:22,309 --> 01:42:24,311
Could you come
with us, please?

1666
01:42:24,436 --> 01:42:26,939
It's about
your daughter.

1667
01:42:27,064 --> 01:42:29,608
I'm very sorry.

1668
01:42:29,733 --> 01:42:31,318
She was found
in your house.

1669
01:42:31,443 --> 01:42:34,446
She was deceased.

1670
01:42:34,571 --> 01:42:37,115
I'm very sorry.

1671
01:42:37,241 --> 01:42:39,243
I'm really sorry,
ma'am.

1672
01:42:41,829 --> 01:42:43,247
Mom!

1673
01:43:01,557 --> 01:43:02,975
Ladies and gentlemen,

1674
01:43:03,058 --> 01:43:04,560
just take your seats,
please.

1675
01:43:06,061 --> 01:43:08,480
Ladies and gentlemen,
please.

1676
01:44:00,616 --> 01:44:02,034
Leo.

1677
01:44:09,708 --> 01:44:11,627
Look, um...

1678
01:44:11,710 --> 01:44:15,631
I just want to tell you

1679
01:44:15,714 --> 01:44:18,634
you got nothing to
worry about 'cause...

1680
01:44:18,675 --> 01:44:21,001
well, I got friends.

1681
01:44:21,053 --> 01:44:24,473
And they can
protect us.

1682
01:44:24,556 --> 01:44:26,475
Listen, I heard rumors
that some people

1683
01:44:26,558 --> 01:44:28,477
from the attorney
general's office

1684
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:29,978
are gonna want
to talk to you,

1685
01:44:30,062 --> 01:44:31,980
butyou can't lose
your head,

1686
01:44:32,064 --> 01:44:33,774
so, you know,
just stick with us.

1687
01:44:33,857 --> 01:44:37,152
And, um...

1688
01:44:37,236 --> 01:44:39,738
in the future...

1689
01:44:39,863 --> 01:44:42,574
you know,
whatever you need.

1690
01:45:07,516 --> 01:45:09,810
You coming back inside?

1691
01:45:14,189 --> 01:45:16,191
You know,
your mother needs you.

1692
01:45:28,996 --> 01:45:30,747
Come on.

1693
01:46:41,360 --> 01:46:44,363
I am not
an important person.

1694
01:46:44,488 --> 01:46:47,282
My only purpose here today
is to shed some light

1695
01:46:47,324 --> 01:46:51,787
on my experience
in a corrupt system.

1696
01:46:51,870 --> 01:46:55,332
I know that I have made
my own mistakes through time,

1697
01:46:55,415 --> 01:46:58,377
but I have paid
my debts to society.

1698
01:46:58,502 --> 01:47:01,130
I hope today to re-enter
the community

1699
01:47:01,213 --> 01:47:02,673
as a productive citizen.

1700
01:47:02,798 --> 01:47:05,634
That is all I want.

1701
01:47:05,717 --> 01:47:09,138
That is all I have ever wanted.
Thank you.

1702
01:47:09,221 --> 01:47:10,681
We would like
to thank you, Mr. Handler,

1703
01:47:10,722 --> 01:47:14,810
for your courageousness in
coming forward this morning.

1704
01:47:14,893 --> 01:47:17,104
I will now ask you
to read into the record

1705
01:47:17,146 --> 01:47:18,605
the names of
those individuals

1706
01:47:18,730 --> 01:47:20,149
who you contend

1707
01:47:20,232 --> 01:47:22,901
are the key members
of this conspiracy.

1708
01:47:25,362 --> 01:47:27,865
Mr. Arthur C. Mydanick.

1709
01:47:29,449 --> 01:47:32,119
Mr. Seymour Korman.

1710
01:47:33,620 --> 01:47:36,582
Mr. Frank H. Olchin.

1711
01:47:37,749 --> 01:47:40,669
Mr. Paul Lazzarides.

1712
01:47:43,255 --> 01:47:45,757
And Mr. Willie Gutierrez.

1713
01:47:48,260 --> 01:47:51,138
I would also like
to finish by saying

1714
01:47:51,180 --> 01:47:54,433
that as a product of
my street environment

1715
01:47:54,475 --> 01:47:56,393
I am well aware of
the code of silence

1716
01:47:56,445 --> 01:47:58,770
that I have just violated.

1717
01:47:58,979 --> 01:48:02,441
But many lives have been
destroyed by this system,

1718
01:48:02,493 --> 01:48:04,568
and I believe
that in years to come,

1719
01:48:04,860 --> 01:48:08,155
my testimony will be
viewed for what it is

1720
01:48:08,197 --> 01:48:11,158
and that I will not have
to look back on this day

1721
01:48:11,200 --> 01:48:13,368
with any regret.
Thank you.
