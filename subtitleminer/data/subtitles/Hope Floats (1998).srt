00:00:22,834 --> 00:00:25,534
Welcome to the Toni Post show.
I am your host Toni Post.

2
00:00:25,735 --> 00:00:28,535
We love life.
I love life.

3
00:00:28,536 --> 00:00:30,836
I love life.
I love my job.

4
00:00:30,937 --> 00:00:32,437
You know why I love my job?

5
00:00:32,538 --> 00:00:34,838
Caus' I get to wake up each morning
and spend it with you.

6
00:00:34,839 --> 00:00:38,539
That's right.
And I mean that.

7
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,140
We're going to talk about real things today.
We're going to talk about real people.

8
00:00:43,344 --> 00:00:44,411
We're going
to get down and dirty.

9
00:00:44,412 --> 00:00:45,812
And that's what makes it different.

10
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:48,846
All right, let's start
with our first guest.

11
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:51,678
- Connie Phillips from Chicago.
- Hi.

12
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:54,844
We want to ask you
how you feel...

13
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:57,354
about this friend
we've heard so much about.

14
00:00:57,457 --> 00:01:02,360
I'd walk through fire for her.
She's my best friend, you know?

15
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:03,996
Best friend.

16
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:08,066
And how long have you been
having sex with her husband?

17
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:09,532
A little over a year.

18
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:13,798
Well, he doesn't love her.
He loves me.

19
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,432
Does she know why
she's appearing on our show?

20
00:01:18,044 --> 00:01:20,239
She thinks she's here
for a makeover.

21
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:24,410
Ouch. That's got to hurt.

22
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:27,644
I'm sure we're all wondering
why you chose...

23
00:01:27,787 --> 00:01:30,779
to reveal this to her
on national television.

24
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,916
Because I want her to hear
my point of view.

25
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:37,120
I really want her to hear me,
you know?

26
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:39,254
Fair enough.
Let's bring her out.

27
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:41,993
Let's bring out Birdee.
Give Birdee a hand.

28
00:01:45,738 --> 00:01:46,670
Hi, Birdee.

29
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:55,370
- So tell us, how do you feel?
- I'm delightful, thank you.

30
00:01:55,548 --> 00:02:01,111
Do you recognize the voice of
the person sitting next to you?

31
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,780
- Hi, Birdee.
- Connie?

32
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,152
My... my best friend Connie?

33
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:08,750
Absolutely correct.
Take off your blindfold.

34
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:12,330
Oh, my God! Hi!

35
00:02:12,498 --> 00:02:15,365
Birdee,
Connie is your best friend?

36
00:02:15,501 --> 00:02:16,559
Yes, she is.

37
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:19,035
She says she loves you
very much.

38
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:22,232
Yeah. I love you, too.

39
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:25,400
The last thing
she wants to do is hurt you.

40
00:02:28,981 --> 00:02:31,074
- Connie?
- Birdee...

41
00:02:33,986 --> 00:02:36,284
Billy and I are having
an affair.

42
00:02:36,388 --> 00:02:39,448
He doesn't love you anymore.
He wants to marry me.

43
00:02:50,335 --> 00:02:51,359
What? I...

44
00:02:51,536 --> 00:02:54,869
Your friendship is
very important to Connie.

45
00:02:54,973 --> 00:02:56,770
She loves you very much, Birdee.

46
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:03,338
- You've been sleeping with him?
- Well, yeah.

47
00:03:03,482 --> 00:03:06,974
Actually, Connie told us
she had sex with Bill...

48
00:03:07,085 --> 00:03:09,246
in your home
on your living room floor.

49
00:03:12,724 --> 00:03:16,160
I want to hear
what Bill has to say. Do you?

50
00:03:16,294 --> 00:03:19,695
All right. Let's bring Bill in.
Come in, Bill. Join us.

51
00:03:21,967 --> 00:03:23,127
That's right.

52
00:03:24,936 --> 00:03:27,564
Come on, come on, come on.

53
00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:31,334
Bill, thank you for appearing
on the Toni Post Show.

54
00:03:31,476 --> 00:03:34,536
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Take off your blindfold.

55
00:03:39,885 --> 00:03:43,719
Bill, are you having an affair
with your wife's best friend?

56
00:03:56,568 --> 00:03:57,728
Yes, ma'am.

57
00:04:00,771 --> 00:04:04,138
All right. That's it.
We've got to take a break.

58
00:04:04,275 --> 00:04:08,143
We'll be back with some more
sizzle on the Toni Post Show.

59
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:31,726
Bernice, did you get
my suitcase in the car?

60
00:04:31,869 --> 00:04:33,166
Yes.
Yeah, Mama.

61
00:04:33,304 --> 00:04:34,999
We'll be there in a few days.

62
00:04:38,876 --> 00:04:42,937
Well, if it's not
an... inconvenience.

63
00:04:49,353 --> 00:04:50,547
Oh...

64
00:04:52,523 --> 00:04:56,118
All right. Me, too. Bye-bye.

65
00:05:22,086 --> 00:05:25,146
Don't look back, sweetheart.
It's bad luck.

66
00:05:25,256 --> 00:05:28,350
Turn around.
Put on your seat belt.

67
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,401
Take the wheel.

68
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:49,041
Bernice, don't be a baby.
Just take the wheel.

69
00:05:49,145 --> 00:05:50,942
Come on. Come here.

70
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,815
OK... thank you.

71
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,048
Here we go.

72
00:06:05,795 --> 00:06:07,956
"Dear Princess,

73
00:06:08,097 --> 00:06:10,497
"I know you're confused now,
and I don't blame you.

74
00:06:10,633 --> 00:06:13,227
"None of this is your fault.

75
00:06:13,369 --> 00:06:15,462
"This is between
your mom and me.

76
00:06:15,638 --> 00:06:18,334
"Not a day will pass
when I won't think about you...

77
00:06:18,474 --> 00:06:19,839
"and wish you were with me.

78
00:06:19,943 --> 00:06:22,741
"I love you, honey.
Be nice to your mom.

79
00:06:22,912 --> 00:06:24,345
All my heart. Daddy."

80
00:06:41,464 --> 00:06:47,266
Baby, baby,
I'm aware of where you go

81
00:06:49,138 --> 00:06:54,007
Each time you leave my door

82
00:06:55,411 --> 00:06:59,780
I watch you walk down the street

83
00:07:02,085 --> 00:07:07,682
Knowing your other love
you're gonna meet

84
00:07:09,025 --> 00:07:14,291
This time,
before you run to her

85
00:07:15,564 --> 00:07:20,433
Leaving me alone and hurt

86
00:07:20,602 --> 00:07:23,070
Think it over

87
00:07:23,171 --> 00:07:26,038
Haven't I been good to you?

88
00:07:27,442 --> 00:07:30,639
Think it over

89
00:07:30,779 --> 00:07:32,906
What's that funny smell?

90
00:07:33,048 --> 00:07:34,310
Cows.

91
00:07:34,449 --> 00:07:37,577
Is this where you were
Cream of Corn?

92
00:07:37,719 --> 00:07:41,052
Queen of Corn, honey,
three years running.

93
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:44,424
A feat unsurpassed
in the history of Smithville.

94
00:07:44,559 --> 00:07:45,719
Oh.

95
00:07:46,762 --> 00:07:51,825
Maybe that was a long time ago,
but believe me, honey,

96
00:07:51,967 --> 00:07:54,902
once upon a time, your mama knew
what it meant to shine.

97
00:07:56,204 --> 00:08:00,971
Before you break my heart

98
00:08:01,143 --> 00:08:01,837
Think it over

99
00:08:02,177 --> 00:08:03,508
Think it over

100
00:08:09,651 --> 00:08:14,247
Oh, you're here!
You're actually here!

101
00:08:14,356 --> 00:08:17,553
Oh, my baby. My babies!

102
00:08:17,726 --> 00:08:19,091
Bernice.
Look at me.

103
00:08:19,227 --> 00:08:22,560
You are so pretty! Oh...

104
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,728
You look just like my mama,
you know that?

105
00:08:27,869 --> 00:08:29,268
- And Bird...
- Hey, Mama.

106
00:08:30,572 --> 00:08:34,531
- Birdee, you take up drinkin'?
- No, I have not. Go inside.

107
00:08:34,676 --> 00:08:38,009
You mean you're stone sober?
You look just awful.

108
00:08:38,113 --> 00:08:42,675
- Well, I... feel awful, Mama.
- Well, you look it.

109
00:08:43,685 --> 00:08:45,016
Well, I feel it.

110
00:08:45,854 --> 00:08:48,516
Well... you look it.

111
00:08:49,323 --> 00:08:50,756
Let me take one of those.

112
00:08:50,925 --> 00:08:53,291
I got a present for you.
Come on.

113
00:08:53,461 --> 00:08:55,326
Here, Mom.
Can't believe you're here.

114
00:08:56,497 --> 00:08:59,364
OK. Now...
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

115
00:09:00,501 --> 00:09:04,301
OK, that's a present
from your Grandpa and me.

116
00:09:05,206 --> 00:09:07,265
- How is Daddy?
- He's fine.

117
00:09:07,441 --> 00:09:10,569
He has a cold this week.
We can't see him till Saturday,

118
00:09:10,711 --> 00:09:14,147
but... he's, uh...
you know, he's fine.

119
00:09:14,248 --> 00:09:16,978
Good.
It's a bunny purse!

120
00:09:18,085 --> 00:09:19,780
You don't like stuffed animals?

121
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,184
That's all right.
We'll get you settled first.

122
00:09:22,289 --> 00:09:26,225
But be very quiet.
We don't want to wake up Travis.

123
00:09:26,427 --> 00:09:28,019
You remember your cousin,
don't you?

124
00:09:28,129 --> 00:09:30,654
He got so excited waitin'
for y'all to arrive,

125
00:09:30,798 --> 00:09:32,060
he just pooped out.

126
00:09:35,569 --> 00:09:36,797
You see those?

127
00:09:38,005 --> 00:09:40,803
They're Scaredy-Cats.
You get it?

128
00:09:46,247 --> 00:09:49,182
Your Grandpa and I
made a fortune off of them.

129
00:09:49,316 --> 00:09:51,807
Birdee, lock the door.
You want to be murdered?

130
00:09:54,221 --> 00:09:57,349
Don't worry. If they bite you,
they got rubber teeth.

131
00:09:57,491 --> 00:10:01,359
- Did Grandma kill them herself?
- No. They come already dead.

132
00:10:04,065 --> 00:10:06,226
This way, they live forever.

133
00:10:06,367 --> 00:10:09,097
Scaredy-Cats.
Yeah, Scaredy-Cats.

134
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,464
It's a nice room, isn't it?

135
00:10:16,277 --> 00:10:20,441
See that door? Leads right
into mine. Is that neat?

136
00:10:22,683 --> 00:10:26,846
OK... that about does it. Oh...

137
00:10:28,321 --> 00:10:29,686
Got a surprise for you.

138
00:10:33,126 --> 00:10:35,060
So you don't bump
into doors at night.

139
00:10:40,033 --> 00:10:44,493
- OK. Feet in. Arms in or out?
- Out.

140
00:10:44,671 --> 00:10:46,798
Oh. There you go.

141
00:10:49,843 --> 00:10:53,438
Snug as a bug in a rug.
Good night, baby.

142
00:11:32,585 --> 00:11:37,318
Every night,
I dream you're next to me

143
00:11:39,859 --> 00:11:41,986
Tenderly

144
00:11:43,897 --> 00:11:47,025
You say my name

145
00:11:50,036 --> 00:11:54,439
You know everybody's watchin' me

146
00:11:57,343 --> 00:11:59,277
What they see...

147
00:12:00,813 --> 00:12:03,906
Is me watching you

148
00:12:13,058 --> 00:12:15,083
Bad dog, Huckleby!
Bad dog!

149
00:12:16,728 --> 00:12:19,697
Bad dog.

150
00:12:19,831 --> 00:12:21,662
No.

151
00:12:22,968 --> 00:12:24,162
No, no.

152
00:12:27,472 --> 00:12:30,999
What a sweet dog, Mama!
You didn't say you had a pet.

153
00:12:31,109 --> 00:12:33,202
Hey, Travis. How are you?

154
00:12:34,513 --> 00:12:36,276
All right,
you're a boy again.

155
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:38,212
Sit at the table
and eat breakfast.

156
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:41,376
Better do what she says.

157
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:45,148
Grandma stuffs bad little dogs.
Any calls?

158
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:48,384
Any messages we get
will be on that bulletin board.

159
00:12:50,195 --> 00:12:51,753
All right, dig in here.

160
00:12:53,665 --> 00:12:56,156
There.
Bernice, this is Travis.

161
00:12:56,268 --> 00:12:58,532
He visited us in Chicago...
what was it?

162
00:12:59,771 --> 00:13:02,638
Two Christmases ago?

163
00:13:02,808 --> 00:13:04,673
He chewed my
Little House On the Prairie.

164
00:13:06,011 --> 00:13:07,808
Where's Aunt Desiree?

165
00:13:07,946 --> 00:13:12,406
Aunt Desiree's living in
Hollywood now. Right, Travis?

166
00:13:16,521 --> 00:13:20,116
- She's doing a pilot.
- Oh, really? And what's he like?

167
00:13:21,393 --> 00:13:24,260
- That's a show for television.
- Oh.

168
00:13:24,463 --> 00:13:26,795
Aunt Desiree's
gonna be on television?

169
00:13:26,898 --> 00:13:30,129
I was on TV, too.
Fat lot of good it did me.

170
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:32,829
I am proud of both
of my television daughters.

171
00:13:34,973 --> 00:13:38,272
Birdee, you looked so beautiful
on that TV.

172
00:13:39,744 --> 00:13:42,269
- Everybody thought so.
- Who's everybody?

173
00:13:43,514 --> 00:13:45,880
Everybody in Smithville,
that's for sure.

174
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:50,018
Honey, if you don't want
people to see you,

175
00:13:50,154 --> 00:13:51,712
why'd you go on television?

176
00:13:51,856 --> 00:13:56,919
Because I wanted
a free makeover, that's all.

177
00:13:57,061 --> 00:13:59,859
You got one. Just
a different kind, that's all.

178
00:14:02,233 --> 00:14:06,636
So, Bernice, what are
your plans? Stop that, Travis.

179
00:14:07,738 --> 00:14:11,299
- My name is Aunt Birdee.
- Well, stop that, Aunt Birdee.

180
00:14:11,442 --> 00:14:14,809
I don't know.
You should make some.

181
00:14:14,945 --> 00:14:17,470
You're starting
a whole new life here.

182
00:14:17,615 --> 00:14:19,412
Anything you wish is possible.

183
00:14:23,054 --> 00:14:24,282
Is that marmalade
over there?

184
00:14:24,455 --> 00:14:26,514
Oh, no... excuse me.

185
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:29,958
Travis, I said stop it.

186
00:14:30,861 --> 00:14:33,728
If anything's possible,
like Grandma says,

187
00:14:33,898 --> 00:14:35,525
then I want more friends.

188
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,258
What if they don't like me?

189
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:44,673
Oh, Bernice, don't worry.
You're a likable girl.

190
00:14:44,809 --> 00:14:49,405
You are. You want more friends?
Is that what you're wishing for?

191
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,275
Yeah, yeah... granted.

192
00:14:54,051 --> 00:14:55,882
Bernice, telephone.

193
00:15:02,993 --> 00:15:05,120
Bernice?
Hey, Daddy.

194
00:15:05,229 --> 00:15:06,662
I miss you so much.

195
00:15:20,276 --> 00:15:23,439
Daddy says hi.
He really misses me.

196
00:15:25,949 --> 00:15:27,382
I'm sure he does, sweetheart.

197
00:15:41,898 --> 00:15:44,059
I'm glad
you only missed six weeks here.

198
00:15:45,468 --> 00:15:47,993
I'm sure the Chicago schools
are way ahead of here.

199
00:15:48,104 --> 00:15:50,072
Keep it up! Keep it up!

200
00:15:50,206 --> 00:15:54,040
Keep that Tiger spirit up!
Say keep... it... up!

201
00:15:55,278 --> 00:15:58,247
Sure you don't want me
to pick you up after school?

202
00:15:58,381 --> 00:16:00,110
- I'll walk home with Travis.
- OK.

203
00:16:01,017 --> 00:16:03,485
Say keep... it... up!

204
00:16:04,354 --> 00:16:08,085
Keep it up! Keep it up!
Keep that Tiger spirit up!

205
00:16:08,224 --> 00:16:10,385
Say keep... it... up!

206
00:16:25,074 --> 00:16:27,941
It smells the same way...
peanut butter and paste.

207
00:16:28,077 --> 00:16:30,443
Can you smell it? Huh?

208
00:16:30,613 --> 00:16:33,480
All right, you look perfect.
You ready?

209
00:16:35,852 --> 00:16:38,184
Maybe I could go in alone.

210
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:41,815
Hmm. Show 'em you're
the independent type, huh?

211
00:16:43,092 --> 00:16:46,323
Yeah. You're gonna do great.

212
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:48,931
- Mm-hmm.
- Go knock 'em dead.

213
00:16:49,065 --> 00:16:50,191
- OK.
- OK?

214
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:51,959
- Bye, Mom.
- Hey.

215
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,500
Come back here.
What's the matter with you?

216
00:16:54,636 --> 00:16:55,933
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye, Baby.

217
00:16:59,341 --> 00:17:01,832
Yes, that's correct, Harry.

218
00:17:01,977 --> 00:17:04,070
"Gave me a turtle."

219
00:17:04,213 --> 00:17:07,239
OK, "He drunk that water fast."
Brandy.

220
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:09,213
"He drank that water fast."

221
00:17:09,318 --> 00:17:14,551
Very good.
"He drank that water fast."

222
00:17:14,723 --> 00:17:17,089
That's the correct answer.
Very good.

223
00:17:17,226 --> 00:17:20,627
OK, Bernice.
Class, this is Bernice Pruitt.

224
00:17:20,762 --> 00:17:22,627
Bernice comes to us
from Chicago.

225
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:28,768
Take the desk next to Kirsten.
That'll be your seat. Kirsten?

226
00:17:29,872 --> 00:17:31,464
Go on, honey.

227
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:36,839
Class, let's open up your books
to page 76, chapter three.

228
00:17:36,945 --> 00:17:39,505
Pay attention,
'cause there's a quiz on Monday.

229
00:17:39,681 --> 00:17:41,649
She's got pop-eyes.

230
00:17:43,619 --> 00:17:46,986
Bernice,
follow along with Kirsten, OK?

231
00:17:51,793 --> 00:17:55,320
I didn't do anything.
Why is it always my fault?

232
00:17:56,198 --> 00:17:57,665
I didn't say anything
about fault.

233
00:17:57,799 --> 00:18:00,393
I just asked what you did,
that's all.

234
00:18:00,536 --> 00:18:04,131
Nothing. People fall in love,
they fall right back out.

235
00:18:04,273 --> 00:18:06,207
Happens all the time.

236
00:18:06,341 --> 00:18:08,809
You never told me
you were having trouble.

237
00:18:10,812 --> 00:18:13,280
Maybe I didn't want to hear,
"I told you so."

238
00:18:15,484 --> 00:18:17,509
Besides,
how could we have trouble?

239
00:18:19,054 --> 00:18:22,455
Prom queen. Quarterback.
Pride of Smithville.

240
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:24,286
Practically left town
on a float.

241
00:18:26,828 --> 00:18:28,351
Maybe you were special.

242
00:18:28,496 --> 00:18:32,796
Then again, maybe you're
just like the rest of us,

243
00:18:32,934 --> 00:18:36,700
except you were riding around
on flowers made of toilet paper.

244
00:18:37,972 --> 00:18:41,703
- You just never liked Bill.
- I like all of God's creatures.

245
00:18:41,842 --> 00:18:44,777
I just like some of them better
stuffed, and he's one of 'em.

246
00:18:45,846 --> 00:18:49,441
Just cut to the part
where he started fooling around.

247
00:18:55,756 --> 00:18:58,691
Well, at cocktail parties,

248
00:18:58,826 --> 00:19:03,763
the women that Bill worked with
would never look at me.

249
00:19:05,967 --> 00:19:07,628
Their eyes were always
surveying the room,

250
00:19:07,768 --> 00:19:10,362
looking for somebody better
to talk to.

251
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:16,768
I was just a beauty queen
from Smithville. I was a joke.

252
00:19:16,911 --> 00:19:20,403
- That's it.
- No. You were never a joke.

253
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:24,481
Yeah, I was, Mama.

254
00:19:25,753 --> 00:19:28,051
You could see it in his eyes.

255
00:19:39,934 --> 00:19:44,166
Honey, crying over it
won't make it clean.

256
00:19:46,073 --> 00:19:49,668
Life just goes on, and you got
to move along with it.

257
00:19:51,045 --> 00:19:51,909
Yeah.

258
00:19:56,917 --> 00:19:58,350
- Bud.
- Weiser.

259
00:19:59,887 --> 00:20:02,185
- How's your dinner, Kermit?
- Good.

260
00:20:03,124 --> 00:20:06,092
We seem to be
the only ones enjoying it.

261
00:20:06,726 --> 00:20:08,455
You ever see two such mopes?

262
00:20:08,595 --> 00:20:11,462
That's a mope,
and that's a mope.

263
00:20:11,631 --> 00:20:14,156
- All right, Mama.
- No, it isn't all right.

264
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:19,567
Look at me. My life has no big
meaning or direction or purpose,

265
00:20:19,739 --> 00:20:20,899
and I'm happy.

266
00:20:22,142 --> 00:20:26,010
Look at Kermit here.
You think it's easy being green?

267
00:20:28,581 --> 00:20:29,445
Ribbit.

268
00:20:30,917 --> 00:20:33,442
I saw that, Bernice. That smile
means there's hope for you.

269
00:20:34,821 --> 00:20:35,412
I saw that, Bernice. That smile
means there's hope for you.

270
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:38,052
I got it!

271
00:20:41,161 --> 00:20:42,924
You expecting someone?

272
00:20:43,063 --> 00:20:46,055
No. I mean,
it might be Justin Matisse.

273
00:20:46,199 --> 00:20:49,191
He said he might drop over
after his day job.

274
00:20:49,335 --> 00:20:51,599
He's helping me fix the porch.

275
00:20:51,738 --> 00:20:54,298
I don't want to see him.
Hi, Travis.

276
00:20:54,441 --> 00:20:56,306
Why?
'Cause your hair's not fixed?

277
00:20:56,509 --> 00:20:59,205
- He's back from California.
- So what?

278
00:20:59,312 --> 00:21:01,678
- And... Justin, come on in!
- Mama.

279
00:21:08,988 --> 00:21:10,979
Hey... Justin.

280
00:21:11,124 --> 00:21:15,356
Well, well, well,
if it ain't Birdee Calvert.

281
00:21:15,495 --> 00:21:18,589
- It's Pruitt. Birdee Pruitt.
- Sorry.

282
00:21:20,366 --> 00:21:21,390
It's all right.

283
00:21:22,769 --> 00:21:24,361
Birdee, Birdee, Birdee.

284
00:21:26,072 --> 00:21:29,838
- Move on to something else.
- I heard you'd come back.

285
00:21:31,244 --> 00:21:32,506
Wonder how.

286
00:21:34,481 --> 00:21:39,145
- This is my daughter Bernice.
- Bernice, Bernice, Bernice.

287
00:21:40,286 --> 00:21:41,343
That's funny.

288
00:21:42,254 --> 00:21:45,451
- You smell delicious, Justin.
- Thanks.

289
00:21:45,624 --> 00:21:48,320
- You wearing cologne?
- No, that's...

290
00:21:49,394 --> 00:21:52,261
A little paint thinner
with sweat mixed in with it.

291
00:21:52,431 --> 00:21:56,162
Ha ha! It sure smells
good, doesn't it, Birdee?

292
00:21:57,402 --> 00:22:01,168
Go out on the porch, and Birdee
will bring you some iced tea.

293
00:22:01,306 --> 00:22:03,171
That sounds great. Thank you.

294
00:22:03,342 --> 00:22:04,604
Bye, y'all.
Bye.

295
00:22:04,777 --> 00:22:06,904
Bye, Bernice-Bernice-Bernice.

296
00:22:07,012 --> 00:22:09,674
Great to see you, Birdee.
You look good.

297
00:22:19,057 --> 00:22:20,217
Here.

298
00:22:21,894 --> 00:22:23,054
Oh, hey, Bernice.

299
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:25,790
Thank you.

300
00:22:26,832 --> 00:22:29,198
There's no glass
for your mother.

301
00:22:29,334 --> 00:22:30,858
She went upstairs.

302
00:22:31,003 --> 00:22:33,836
My daddy usually calls
for one of his daily chats,

303
00:22:33,972 --> 00:22:35,337
and then we all turn in.

304
00:22:35,507 --> 00:22:39,910
I see. So, how do you like it
down here in Smithville?

305
00:22:40,012 --> 00:22:43,175
It wasn't on any maps
until we got to Texas.

306
00:22:44,983 --> 00:22:47,747
We like to keep it a secret.

307
00:22:47,886 --> 00:22:49,751
That way, it doesn't get
overrun with people.

308
00:22:49,922 --> 00:22:51,412
Seems to be working.

309
00:22:53,492 --> 00:22:58,293
- Your mother and I go way back.
- I know. You must.

310
00:23:00,299 --> 00:23:05,032
Back home, we had a pet skunk.
Mom called it Justin Matisse.

311
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:06,637
You think that's a coincidence?

312
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:12,106
All day long, Mom would scream,
"You stink, Justin Matisse!"

313
00:23:12,244 --> 00:23:14,644
Finally, she just
picked up a club and killed it.

314
00:23:16,248 --> 00:23:18,408
That's a sad story.

315
00:23:18,583 --> 00:23:21,575
If you liked the skunk,
which we didn't.

316
00:23:21,719 --> 00:23:24,210
She still has that club
in her purse upstairs.

317
00:23:26,224 --> 00:23:28,692
I guess that means
she's not coming down.

318
00:23:28,826 --> 00:23:30,225
Not until you leave.

319
00:23:32,797 --> 00:23:37,325
Guess I better go, then.
Thanks for packing up my stuff.

320
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:42,636
I'll see you around. That's
what's great about a small town.

321
00:23:56,053 --> 00:23:57,111
Birdee!

322
00:23:59,657 --> 00:24:03,388
What, Mama?
Can you give me a hand?

323
00:24:18,442 --> 00:24:20,808
Huh? What? Ma... Mama.

324
00:24:20,945 --> 00:24:24,073
Oh, honey,
are you still in here?

325
00:24:24,181 --> 00:24:25,808
I had no idea.

326
00:24:27,285 --> 00:24:30,220
It's a beautiful day out.
Take a look at it.

327
00:24:30,354 --> 00:24:32,584
- Oh...
- Go on.

328
00:24:32,757 --> 00:24:35,851
Get out there.
Get the stink blown off ya.

329
00:24:35,993 --> 00:24:39,121
- I always hated that expression.
- Don't make me use it, then.

330
00:24:39,263 --> 00:24:41,424
I'm gonna turn
the shower on for you.

331
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:44,033
I'm going shopping later,
if you want to get out.

332
00:25:12,028 --> 00:25:13,120
Mama!

333
00:25:14,431 --> 00:25:15,796
Mama!

334
00:25:16,933 --> 00:25:22,064
Mama, can't this... Mama! Mama!
Mother! Justin. Hey.

335
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,502
- What are you doing up here?
- Building shelves.

336
00:25:27,844 --> 00:25:31,507
You look terrible.
You been drinkin', huh?

337
00:25:32,749 --> 00:25:35,183
Why does everybody
keep asking me that?

338
00:25:35,285 --> 00:25:39,984
Is there a coaster stuck
to my butt or something?

339
00:25:40,156 --> 00:25:42,556
- How long will this take?
- A couple hours.

340
00:25:44,494 --> 00:25:46,462
Go down and get dressed.
You'll feel better.

341
00:25:47,597 --> 00:25:49,428
You must feel depressed,
looking like that.

342
00:25:51,167 --> 00:25:54,728
Do you always say what's on your
mind, or is this my lucky day?

343
00:25:54,871 --> 00:25:56,998
I won't do you any favors
by lying.

344
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:00,906
I don't need your favors.
All right?

345
00:26:01,044 --> 00:26:04,377
- I just need... something.
- Is that an invitation?

346
00:26:06,549 --> 00:26:08,073
Bye.
Bye.

347
00:26:15,492 --> 00:26:17,357
Remember the blue beetle?

348
00:26:17,494 --> 00:26:19,189
It promised us a long,
happy life.

349
00:26:33,776 --> 00:26:34,902
Forget it.

350
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:42,006
Hansel and Gretel's mom
was terrible.

351
00:26:42,151 --> 00:26:46,645
Why didn't the witch eat her?
You didn't tell the story right.

352
00:26:46,789 --> 00:26:51,624
Your mama's gonna come get you
as soon as she can. I promise.

353
00:26:51,794 --> 00:26:54,854
And stop pickin' at that doll's
eyes. That makes me nervous.

354
00:26:54,997 --> 00:26:56,157
Bernice!

355
00:26:57,633 --> 00:27:00,101
Bernice! Come here.

356
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:03,069
What do you think you're doing?
Do you think I'm stupid?

357
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:04,331
What's the matter?

358
00:27:04,506 --> 00:27:06,269
What do you think
you're doing?

359
00:27:06,408 --> 00:27:07,568
What did I do?

360
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:09,472
If you have
something to say,

361
00:27:09,611 --> 00:27:12,273
say it flat out,
don't say it behind my back!

362
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:14,845
- You have something to tell me?
- No.

363
00:27:14,983 --> 00:27:16,678
- Tell me!
- What should I say?

364
00:27:16,819 --> 00:27:19,549
Stop playing innocent!
I know what you told him!

365
00:27:19,688 --> 00:27:21,155
- Told who?
- Your father, Bernice!

366
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:23,690
I just got off the phone
with him.

367
00:27:23,826 --> 00:27:26,124
He said, "I'm sorry
you're taking this so hard.

368
00:27:26,261 --> 00:27:29,662
Sorry you can't get out of bed,
but we have a daughter."

369
00:27:29,798 --> 00:27:32,266
- What did you say to him?
- Nothing. It wasn't bad.

370
00:27:32,434 --> 00:27:34,629
I just said you were sad.
We both are.

371
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:37,432
That is our business!
That's not his business!

372
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:39,302
We're not sad! We're fine!

373
00:27:39,441 --> 00:27:42,274
We're not! You don't care about
me, don't ask me about school.

374
00:27:42,377 --> 00:27:45,505
You don't make breakfast for me.
You said you'd take care of me!

375
00:27:45,681 --> 00:27:48,946
I promised Daddy?
Daddy promised me the world,

376
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:50,949
and Daddy didn't honor
his promise,

377
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,486
and I will break every promise
I make to him!

378
00:27:53,622 --> 00:27:55,590
Birdee, stop it!
That's enough, now.

379
00:27:57,159 --> 00:28:00,151
It is not a crime to tell
the truth... not in this house.

380
00:28:00,295 --> 00:28:02,763
- Don't yell at her!
- She's my daughter.

381
00:28:02,898 --> 00:28:06,891
I'll yell at her all I want.
Just take a look at yourself.

382
00:28:07,035 --> 00:28:10,526
Wandering around night and day
in your bathrobe?

383
00:28:10,705 --> 00:28:13,003
You're hiding out.
You're scared.

384
00:28:13,107 --> 00:28:14,597
Lord, what happened to you?

385
00:28:16,511 --> 00:28:21,505
- You used to be so pleasing.
- I had to be pleasing, Mama.

386
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:25,312
With the town joke as a mother,
I had to be.

387
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:29,651
When you'd flounce into school
with your road-kill hat...

388
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:33,624
and your freshly skinned bag,
I learned how to be pleasing.

389
00:28:33,761 --> 00:28:37,060
You're pleasing nobody.
You're miserable yourself.

390
00:28:37,198 --> 00:28:40,827
And I've never been unhappy,
so the joke is on you, honey.

391
00:28:41,836 --> 00:28:44,896
- Don't yell at her!
- I'm finished, believe me.

392
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,208
Come on out here, Travis.

393
00:29:09,564 --> 00:29:11,293
I didn't hurt you, did I?

394
00:29:16,737 --> 00:29:19,171
'Cause I wouldn't hurt you
for anything in the world.

395
00:29:25,313 --> 00:29:28,544
- That's OK. Night, Travis.
- Good night.

396
00:29:57,577 --> 00:30:00,444
We got a beautiful day
going in the Austin area,

397
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:03,708
and all your favorites
on your oldies station,

398
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:05,283
playing all the good ones.

399
00:30:05,452 --> 00:30:07,852
Excuse me.
You'll like this one.

400
00:30:07,954 --> 00:30:11,754
Birdee! Birdee Calvert! Oh!

401
00:30:12,792 --> 00:30:16,387
- I heard you were back in town!
- Hello.

402
00:30:16,529 --> 00:30:18,019
Debbie. Debbie Reissen.

403
00:30:19,933 --> 00:30:22,766
- Debbie Reissen!
- How are you?

404
00:30:22,902 --> 00:30:26,497
- How are you?
- Did you come to see Dot?

405
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,074
- Dot?
- She runs the whole office now.

406
00:30:29,909 --> 00:30:32,241
Oh, yeah, I came to see Dot.

407
00:30:32,345 --> 00:30:34,836
- She'll be so tickled!
- Oh, great.

408
00:30:36,783 --> 00:30:39,843
Dottie, in a million years,
you'll never guess who came...

409
00:30:39,986 --> 00:30:42,955
all the way from Chicago
to see you!

410
00:30:43,089 --> 00:30:44,681
Take me off the intercom.

411
00:30:50,764 --> 00:30:54,029
She guessed.
Would you like to have a seat?

412
00:30:54,968 --> 00:30:57,163
- Great. Thank you.
- She'll be right with you.

413
00:31:04,044 --> 00:31:07,502
- I saw you on television.
- Really?

414
00:31:07,647 --> 00:31:10,707
- I taped it.
- Yeah.

415
00:31:18,625 --> 00:31:20,489
Birdee, come on in.

416
00:31:21,627 --> 00:31:23,356
No calls, Deborah.

417
00:31:23,495 --> 00:31:24,894
- Hi.
- Hi.

418
00:31:32,204 --> 00:31:34,900
- I didn't keep you too long?
- It's fine, thank you.

419
00:31:37,042 --> 00:31:40,170
You look beautiful.
Same old Birdee.

420
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,277
Same old Dot.

421
00:31:48,654 --> 00:31:51,179
You have no idea
who I am, do you?

422
00:31:53,659 --> 00:31:57,459
- No. Sorry. I don't.
- It's all right.

423
00:31:59,298 --> 00:32:01,528
When I knew you,
I was five inches shorter...

424
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,361
and 70 pounds heavier.

425
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:06,601
We didn't eat at the same table.

426
00:32:07,806 --> 00:32:09,103
Polka Dot?

427
00:32:09,241 --> 00:32:12,802
Oh!
Is that right?

428
00:32:12,945 --> 00:32:17,245
Yeah. Nobody's called me that
in a long time.

429
00:32:17,383 --> 00:32:21,683
- Oh, my God! You look fantastic!
- Thank you.

430
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:23,583
- You're welcome.
- Have a seat.

431
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:28,523
Oh, my God!
I mean, it's remarkable.

432
00:32:28,694 --> 00:32:30,662
Was I really
that terrible before?

433
00:32:30,796 --> 00:32:33,993
- Oh, no, no, I just meant...
- I know what you meant.

434
00:32:35,067 --> 00:32:38,059
People change.
We get better as we get older.

435
00:32:38,203 --> 00:32:41,832
- Yeah.
- You look exactly the same.

436
00:32:43,842 --> 00:32:46,333
- Well, no. Actually, I have a...
- Oh, I know.

437
00:32:46,478 --> 00:32:49,038
- I heard about you and Bill.
- Yeah.

438
00:32:49,181 --> 00:32:51,012
He always was a ladies' man.

439
00:32:53,485 --> 00:32:57,318
- You all right?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

440
00:32:57,422 --> 00:33:03,759
So much of that's staged for TV.
For ratings and... yeah.

441
00:33:06,731 --> 00:33:11,532
So... you need a job. What sort
of work have you been doing?

442
00:33:11,669 --> 00:33:15,833
Um, housework. Bill worked,
and he didn't want...

443
00:33:16,641 --> 00:33:19,075
We have a daughter,
so I took care of her.

444
00:33:20,244 --> 00:33:25,773
- OK. How fast do you type?
- Don't type.

445
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:31,445
OK. Computer skills?

446
00:33:33,324 --> 00:33:34,552
Don't compute.

447
00:33:36,127 --> 00:33:38,789
Oh, goodness.
You'll have to give me...

448
00:33:38,963 --> 00:33:41,124
some sort of idea
of what you're looking for,

449
00:33:41,232 --> 00:33:44,099
'cause I'm not likely to find
a listing for prom queen.

450
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:51,367
Well... I used to take pictures.
I was good at that.

451
00:33:51,542 --> 00:33:54,739
So maybe I could get a job
at the newspaper...

452
00:33:54,879 --> 00:33:57,848
or Jackson's portrait studio.

453
00:33:57,982 --> 00:34:01,110
It's closed down,
and the newspaper's not hiring.

454
00:34:01,252 --> 00:34:03,277
- I can tell you that right now.
- OK.

455
00:34:04,789 --> 00:34:11,251
- So... hmm.
- Dot, I would really like a job.

456
00:34:13,264 --> 00:34:15,562
One that I could
like myself for.

457
00:34:16,701 --> 00:34:19,329
Even if it's just
for a little while.

458
00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:20,767
- Birdee...
- Dot...

459
00:34:24,509 --> 00:34:27,910
I don't know how I treated you
in high school.

460
00:34:30,982 --> 00:34:34,815
I'm guessing it was pretty bad,

461
00:34:34,951 --> 00:34:38,887
seeing how you're hell-bent
on putting me in my place.

462
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:41,918
And that's OK.

463
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:49,189
Just, um...
just put me in a job, too.

464
00:34:52,168 --> 00:34:54,159
I would really be grateful.

465
00:35:01,244 --> 00:35:02,472
Well...

466
00:35:07,617 --> 00:35:09,551
Shoot some pictures
over the weekend.

467
00:35:09,686 --> 00:35:11,881
- OK. Great.
- I'll look 'em over.

468
00:35:12,022 --> 00:35:13,785
- Great.
- I'll do what I can.

469
00:35:15,091 --> 00:35:16,615
Thank you. Thank you.

470
00:35:28,104 --> 00:35:30,368
- Enjoy your food, honey.
- Thanks.

471
00:35:35,345 --> 00:35:39,213
It's not for sissies,
you know... dining alone.

472
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:45,552
Got to be made of
some stern stuff to do that.

473
00:35:45,722 --> 00:35:46,814
Really.

474
00:35:47,991 --> 00:35:49,925
The trick is
to seem mysterious.

475
00:35:52,629 --> 00:35:54,062
Like the choice is yours.

476
00:36:01,137 --> 00:36:05,073
- Impressive.
- Well, you pick these things up.

477
00:36:12,681 --> 00:36:13,978
Care to join me?

478
00:36:18,854 --> 00:36:22,551
Can't do that.
That'd be cheating.

479
00:36:22,725 --> 00:36:25,888
- Oh.
- Besides, I'd rather wait.

480
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:32,123
Well, I got to go.

481
00:36:33,736 --> 00:36:36,170
Remember, mysterious.
That's the key.

482
00:36:36,271 --> 00:36:38,034
- OK.
- Oh...

483
00:36:39,775 --> 00:36:43,905
Maybe, um... order some dessert
just to spite 'em.

484
00:36:45,514 --> 00:36:47,175
- All right.
- Make me proud.

485
00:37:02,398 --> 00:37:04,263
- Keep the change. Thank you.
- Thank you.

486
00:37:05,968 --> 00:37:11,770
Smile
though your heart is aching

487
00:37:13,442 --> 00:37:18,072
Smile even though it's breaking

488
00:37:20,549 --> 00:37:29,082
When there are clouds
in the sky, you'll get by

489
00:37:30,192 --> 00:37:36,461
If you smile
through your fears and sorrow

490
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,994
Smile, and maybe tomorrow

491
00:37:45,774 --> 00:37:51,075
You'll see the sun
come shining through

492
00:37:52,814 --> 00:37:59,686
You just smile

493
00:37:59,821 --> 00:38:01,846
These are good.
Really?

494
00:38:04,158 --> 00:38:08,686
- Really.
- Can you find something for me?

495
00:38:11,999 --> 00:38:14,467
- Think I can.
- Oh...

496
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:17,198
Great. Thanks.

497
00:38:18,473 --> 00:38:20,498
Then you take the film,
like so,

498
00:38:20,641 --> 00:38:23,041
and you run it through here.

499
00:38:24,245 --> 00:38:27,373
- Make sure this is shut tight.
- OK.

500
00:38:27,548 --> 00:38:29,641
Then you just follow it along,
like so.

501
00:38:30,718 --> 00:38:34,950
Then it comes out here, like so.
Then you separate it.

502
00:38:35,089 --> 00:38:36,954
- Like... so.
- That's right.

503
00:38:38,059 --> 00:38:41,586
Everyone's film has to be
developed in less than an hour.

504
00:38:41,763 --> 00:38:43,128
Otherwise, it's free.

505
00:38:43,231 --> 00:38:45,222
- Any questions?
- Nope.

506
00:38:46,601 --> 00:38:50,799
Occasionally, we get pictures of
a somewhat questionable nature.

507
00:38:51,806 --> 00:38:54,502
- Naked pictures?
- We never comment on them.

508
00:38:54,642 --> 00:38:57,509
We just hand them over
as if we hadn't seen a thing.

509
00:38:58,379 --> 00:38:59,573
I understand, Mr. Davis.

510
00:38:59,714 --> 00:39:03,673
But first, we make a copy.
We put them under the counter.

511
00:39:04,452 --> 00:39:08,582
You can have a look anytime you
want, just don't take them home.

512
00:39:08,723 --> 00:39:11,385
- All right.
- You can sit down right there.

513
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:15,088
- OK.
- Birdee Calvert!

514
00:39:16,464 --> 00:39:20,764
I bet the customers will
stand in line to see you again!

515
00:39:37,918 --> 00:39:40,546
We have a full range
of arts and crafts...

516
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,585
to keep our loved ones happy.

517
00:39:42,722 --> 00:39:46,988
It's like summer camp, only
it's all year round. Lucky them.

518
00:39:48,461 --> 00:39:50,691
Charlie, let's go...
Here we are.

519
00:39:50,831 --> 00:39:53,197
Harry...
Look who's here!

520
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,666
Told you she was coming.
All these visitors!

521
00:39:55,836 --> 00:39:59,829
- Oh... so good to see you.
- Well, enjoy.

522
00:40:01,575 --> 00:40:05,341
Oh...
How you keepin', Daddy?

523
00:40:06,479 --> 00:40:10,074
- What's wrong with him?
- It's just a stroke.

524
00:40:10,183 --> 00:40:13,675
And a little old-timers.
She means Alzheimer's.

525
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,219
I know what I mean.

526
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:20,057
You know exactly what's
going on, Daddy. Yeah.

527
00:40:21,328 --> 00:40:25,059
- Thank him for the bunny.
- He doesn't even know who I am.

528
00:40:25,198 --> 00:40:29,134
Sure he does. It's just hard
for him to show it.

529
00:40:29,269 --> 00:40:31,260
- Say hello.
- Uh-uh.

530
00:40:31,404 --> 00:40:32,666
Sure, go ahead.

531
00:40:34,674 --> 00:40:36,608
Travis, you want
to kiss your grandpa?

532
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,849
I think we need
a little ice cream.

533
00:40:42,983 --> 00:40:44,211
That's a great idea.

534
00:40:44,351 --> 00:40:46,876
Let's let Mama and Grandpa
have some time together.

535
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:49,284
- We'll be in the cafeteria.
- You'll be OK?

536
00:40:49,422 --> 00:40:50,582
We're fine.

537
00:40:52,092 --> 00:40:53,150
So...

538
00:40:56,630 --> 00:41:00,531
I'll tell you one thing,
I won't sit here and tell you...

539
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:04,067
what a nice place we got you in
or how good you look.

540
00:41:06,972 --> 00:41:08,803
'Cause we're adults, right?

541
00:41:10,142 --> 00:41:11,404
At least, you are.

542
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:17,443
Mama says you do that
blinking thing with your eyes.

543
00:41:17,616 --> 00:41:20,551
One blink for yes, two for no.
Can you do that?

544
00:41:21,954 --> 00:41:23,046
Hmm?

545
00:41:24,256 --> 00:41:26,690
Just on your good day, huh?
I get it.

546
00:41:32,631 --> 00:41:33,996
That was Bernice, Daddy.

547
00:41:35,601 --> 00:41:37,466
You remember Bernice?

548
00:41:43,108 --> 00:41:44,473
Hmm... there it is.

549
00:41:49,415 --> 00:41:50,905
That's Bernice, Daddy.

550
00:41:56,255 --> 00:41:59,053
She's the best thing
I ever did.

551
00:41:59,191 --> 00:42:01,318
I wish Bill could be here,

552
00:42:01,493 --> 00:42:05,429
but, um... we're having
a little bit of trouble.

553
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:10,830
But enough of that.

554
00:42:13,005 --> 00:42:16,634
I'm going to write her name
right down here...

555
00:42:17,776 --> 00:42:19,175
...on the bottom of her picture.

556
00:42:21,513 --> 00:42:25,449
When she comes back here,
maybe you could recognize her...

557
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:28,781
and give her a little sign
or something.

558
00:42:28,887 --> 00:42:30,582
She could use one, you know?

559
00:42:36,461 --> 00:42:37,621
What, Daddy?

560
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,333
Chances are I'll see you

561
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:49,304
Somewhere in my dreams tonight

562
00:42:51,542 --> 00:42:56,639
I recall your laughter
and your smile

563
00:43:00,651 --> 00:43:08,490
I remember how
you made me feel so at ease

564
00:43:09,994 --> 00:43:16,229
I remember all your grace,
your style

565
00:43:23,941 --> 00:43:27,274
Chances are I'll hold you

566
00:43:27,445 --> 00:43:31,848
And I'll offer all I have

567
00:43:33,451 --> 00:43:39,287
You're the only one
I can't forget

568
00:43:44,829 --> 00:43:48,230
You're the best I've ever met

569
00:43:49,634 --> 00:43:51,295
You don't have
a daddy, either.

570
00:43:53,504 --> 00:43:55,438
Don't break that.
I've had it forever.

571
00:43:57,408 --> 00:43:58,602
Come on. It's late.

572
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:03,874
There you go.

573
00:44:05,349 --> 00:44:09,513
My little burrito baby.
Snug as a bug in a rug.

574
00:44:09,687 --> 00:44:11,780
You're out of luck
if your nose itches.

575
00:44:11,889 --> 00:44:13,253
- Good night.
- Night, Mom.

576
00:44:25,001 --> 00:44:28,061
Well, if it isn't
Birdee Calvert.

577
00:44:28,205 --> 00:44:30,400
Bobbi-Claire Akins.

578
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:33,008
- Patterson now.
- Oh, great!

579
00:44:33,143 --> 00:44:36,943
How are you?
I heard about your sad news.

580
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:39,674
How Bill could
humiliate you like that...

581
00:44:39,816 --> 00:44:43,149
in front of the entire world
is just beyond me.

582
00:44:43,286 --> 00:44:47,120
We have a satellite dish,
so we got to see it twice.

583
00:44:47,290 --> 00:44:50,088
- You poor thing.
- What can I do for you?

584
00:44:50,227 --> 00:44:55,665
Anyway, I brought you these.
My sister's wedding reception.

585
00:44:55,832 --> 00:44:58,426
Triple prints, please. I'll
come back after my hair's done.

586
00:45:00,103 --> 00:45:02,401
I love this thing
you're doing with your hair.

587
00:45:02,539 --> 00:45:06,873
It's so... down-to-earth
and natural-like.

588
00:45:07,010 --> 00:45:09,171
I wish I could be
more like that.

589
00:45:10,547 --> 00:45:12,174
I'm fearless that way.

590
00:45:32,536 --> 00:45:34,470
Oh... no!

591
00:45:34,604 --> 00:45:35,866
No, no, no!

592
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:41,500
No! No! What's the matter
with you, you piece of crap?

593
00:45:41,645 --> 00:45:42,771
Oh, crap.

594
00:45:44,214 --> 00:45:45,340
Mr. Davis!

595
00:45:46,616 --> 00:45:50,210
- I'm sorry, Bobbi-Claire.
- Sorry?

596
00:45:50,352 --> 00:45:53,844
You think that does it? These
pictures were irreplaceable!

597
00:45:53,989 --> 00:45:58,085
- When I was loading the paper...
- Look! There's nothin'!

598
00:45:58,227 --> 00:46:00,821
There's not a blur,
not a face with red eyes!

599
00:46:00,963 --> 00:46:02,828
You think Debbie-Lynn
gets married every day?

600
00:46:02,998 --> 00:46:05,398
Debbie-Lynn?
Isn't this her fourth or...

601
00:46:05,568 --> 00:46:08,366
It is her fifth,
Miss High-and-Mighty,

602
00:46:08,504 --> 00:46:10,938
but they each had
very different themes.

603
00:46:11,073 --> 00:46:12,768
Now there's nothing
to show for it!

604
00:46:13,709 --> 00:46:17,145
At least I caught it before
the other ones got ruined.

605
00:46:17,279 --> 00:46:20,646
Oh, yes. You are just little
Miss Employee of the Month.

606
00:46:20,783 --> 00:46:24,719
Mr. Davis, I hope you make sure
that this never happens again,

607
00:46:24,853 --> 00:46:26,821
and I believe
you know what I mean.

608
00:46:29,325 --> 00:46:30,451
What?

609
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:37,693
Oh, dear.
Am I gonna have to fire you?

610
00:46:38,601 --> 00:46:39,795
She'll cool off.

611
00:46:39,935 --> 00:46:43,268
It must be hard carrying around
all that hair, you know?

612
00:46:44,974 --> 00:46:49,377
Well, if she sends a bill,
I'll have to dock you, Birdee,

613
00:46:49,511 --> 00:46:50,978
for at least half.

614
00:46:51,113 --> 00:46:52,774
- I'm sorry.
- Come on.

615
00:46:52,915 --> 00:46:54,678
Let's get this back on-line.

616
00:46:56,218 --> 00:46:58,743
- Go get back on-line.
- Shut up.

617
00:47:02,458 --> 00:47:05,018
You were the first girl
I ever kissed.

618
00:47:05,127 --> 00:47:06,355
I knew that.

619
00:47:06,528 --> 00:47:08,996
Playing spin-the-bottle.
Yep.

620
00:47:09,098 --> 00:47:11,430
And you stuck
your tongue in my mouth.

621
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:15,001
I didn't know you were supposed
to do that. I was mortified.

622
00:47:15,137 --> 00:47:16,695
Thought you were an epileptic,

623
00:47:16,839 --> 00:47:18,170
so I went home and told Mama
you had a seizure in my mouth.

624
00:47:21,744 --> 00:47:24,144
I was over the moon for you
back then, Birdee.

625
00:47:25,147 --> 00:47:27,410
- You knew that.
- No, I didn't.

626
00:47:30,084 --> 00:47:32,678
- Why didn't you say anything?
- Coward.

627
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:35,618
- Chicken?
- Chicken, pure and simple.

628
00:47:36,658 --> 00:47:39,786
You and Bill were up here.
I was somewhere else.

629
00:47:41,029 --> 00:47:42,860
What if I'd asked you out?

630
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:47,625
I don't know
what I would have said.

631
00:47:47,769 --> 00:47:49,999
I'm not the same person
I was back then.

632
00:47:52,073 --> 00:47:53,768
What if I asked you out now?

633
00:47:58,046 --> 00:47:59,343
Is that what you're doin'?

634
00:48:01,082 --> 00:48:02,344
That's what I'm doin'.

635
00:48:07,422 --> 00:48:08,980
I would have to say no.

636
00:48:14,629 --> 00:48:17,826
I'm a married woman.
What's the matter with you?

637
00:48:17,965 --> 00:48:21,298
Not on a date, though.
Just dinner.

638
00:48:22,904 --> 00:48:26,533
- Married people eat, right?
- I don't know. I don't know.

639
00:48:26,674 --> 00:48:29,336
What about I take you out
for a great fish dinner?

640
00:48:33,247 --> 00:48:35,340
I'm glad
we're not having steak.

641
00:48:35,516 --> 00:48:37,746
I'm a little rusty
at roping steer.

642
00:48:37,852 --> 00:48:39,843
You're not so hot
at this, either.

643
00:48:41,989 --> 00:48:43,183
Relax, Birdee.

644
00:48:45,626 --> 00:48:49,062
Just sit back
and let the fish come to you.

645
00:48:50,498 --> 00:48:52,090
You know who'd love this?
Bernice.

646
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,725
Hey... breathe.

647
00:48:55,670 --> 00:48:56,898
I'm breathing.

648
00:48:58,306 --> 00:48:59,398
Just listen.

649
00:49:07,581 --> 00:49:11,073
- So what have you been doing...
- It kills you to be quiet.

650
00:49:14,054 --> 00:49:16,284
It kills you to answer
a personal question.

651
00:49:20,894 --> 00:49:22,156
I went to California.

652
00:49:29,536 --> 00:49:30,833
You didn't like it?

653
00:49:35,075 --> 00:49:36,440
I'm here, ain't I?

654
00:49:38,512 --> 00:49:40,742
Yes, you are.
Yes, I am.

655
00:49:49,322 --> 00:49:51,313
You know those people
who publish calendars?

656
00:49:51,491 --> 00:49:54,949
- Uh-huh.
- They'd love your pictures.

657
00:49:58,165 --> 00:50:01,999
So I like pretty pictures.
That's who I am.

658
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:05,702
You don't get voted most popular
and best smile...

659
00:50:05,872 --> 00:50:07,737
if you have an edge.

660
00:50:07,874 --> 00:50:09,341
You do have a great smile.

661
00:50:14,548 --> 00:50:15,515
Don't show it to me.

662
00:50:19,786 --> 00:50:20,946
Come here.

663
00:50:24,024 --> 00:50:27,482
Hey. Come sit by me.

664
00:50:35,769 --> 00:50:37,202
- Want to help?
- Nope.

665
00:50:39,805 --> 00:50:41,397
- Don't smile, now.
- I'm not.

666
00:50:44,643 --> 00:50:47,942
Let's see his smile.
He's got a great smile.

667
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:49,274
Hold on.

668
00:50:50,950 --> 00:50:53,111
He won best smile
in his school. Get it?

669
00:51:00,926 --> 00:51:02,325
Hit the ball, Popeye.

670
00:51:18,010 --> 00:51:19,739
Big Dolores!

671
00:51:28,053 --> 00:51:31,250
Can't you do this in the
backyard? It's embarrassing.

672
00:51:31,390 --> 00:51:35,554
Ha ha! Honey, they're dead.
How can they be embarrassed?

673
00:51:37,162 --> 00:51:39,562
I hated this
when I was your age.

674
00:51:39,732 --> 00:51:41,825
One day,
all this will be yours.

675
00:51:42,968 --> 00:51:45,596
Hey, what's wrong?
How was school?

676
00:51:46,839 --> 00:51:48,306
Fine.
Nah-ah!

677
00:51:48,474 --> 00:51:50,601
Big Dolores
is gonna murder Bernice.

678
00:51:51,777 --> 00:51:54,575
- Quiet, Travis.
- Who's Big Dolores?

679
00:51:54,713 --> 00:51:57,910
She's the meanest,
dumbest girl in school,

680
00:51:58,050 --> 00:52:02,214
but she keeps passing 'cause
even teachers are afraid of her.

681
00:52:02,354 --> 00:52:06,620
She has her own gang, too.
It's called... Big Dolores.

682
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:09,918
What's she got against Bernice?

683
00:52:10,062 --> 00:52:13,429
Bernice hit her in the face
with a volleyball...

684
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:15,862
in front of the whole school.

685
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,230
Now Bernice is gonna die.

686
00:52:18,336 --> 00:52:21,134
Did you hit somebody in the face
with a volleyball?

687
00:52:21,306 --> 00:52:23,740
- It was an accident.
- Did you say you were sorry?

688
00:52:24,876 --> 00:52:26,605
She'll kill me anyway.

689
00:52:26,744 --> 00:52:30,373
That whole family's no good.
I think it's glandular.

690
00:52:30,548 --> 00:52:33,108
Whatever gland produces
meanness, they got it.

691
00:52:33,217 --> 00:52:35,151
Mama, nobody's
gonna kill anybody.

692
00:52:35,286 --> 00:52:37,846
I'll just have a talk
with her mother,

693
00:52:37,989 --> 00:52:39,354
and we'll iron everything out.

694
00:52:39,524 --> 00:52:42,322
Don't talk with her mother.
I'd rather die.

695
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:45,258
- Don't worry. You will.
- Travis?

696
00:52:45,363 --> 00:52:47,729
Travis, come down here
and be a tree.

697
00:52:47,899 --> 00:52:50,868
Travis, come here.
Go be a tree.

698
00:52:51,002 --> 00:52:53,869
Mom, promise me you won't
have a talk with her mother.

699
00:52:54,005 --> 00:52:56,132
They'd really have it in
for me after that.

700
00:52:56,274 --> 00:52:58,834
Don't be so dramatic.
Nothing's gonna happen.

701
00:52:59,911 --> 00:53:02,311
You're right, Mom.
It'll be a normal day.

702
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,004
Oh, yes.

703
00:53:07,885 --> 00:53:09,978
Old Man Linton's
make-out spot.

704
00:53:10,121 --> 00:53:12,248
I thought we were going out
for ice cream.

705
00:53:12,423 --> 00:53:14,288
What would your mother say?

706
00:53:14,459 --> 00:53:16,859
She'd probably say,
"Way to go, Justin."

707
00:53:16,995 --> 00:53:18,292
Really.
Yeah.

708
00:53:18,429 --> 00:53:19,589
Uh-huh.

709
00:53:34,345 --> 00:53:37,940
- What an incredible night.
- Mm-hmm.

710
00:53:39,784 --> 00:53:41,513
Place sure hasn't
changed much, has it?

711
00:53:41,686 --> 00:53:43,051
No. Not at all.

712
00:53:44,088 --> 00:53:47,319
- Not that I came here much.
- No. Of course not.

713
00:53:47,492 --> 00:53:50,518
Bill was always in training.
He said it put him off his game.

714
00:53:50,662 --> 00:53:53,357
- Hmm. I see.
- Got riled up the night before.

715
00:53:53,497 --> 00:53:55,522
He didn't look so happy
on TV, either.

716
00:53:55,666 --> 00:54:01,104
Oh, God! Doesn't anybody watch
public television anymore?

717
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:03,229
I couldn't keep my eyes
off of you.

718
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:06,573
Which part captivated you more?

719
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:09,110
Was it the part where...
let's see...

720
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:12,545
where I appeared downtrodden
and pitiful,

721
00:54:12,716 --> 00:54:16,914
or was it the part where
I looked stricken and grotesque?

722
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:21,389
I personally prefer the part
where I looked pathetic.

723
00:54:21,558 --> 00:54:22,786
I liked that one.

724
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:25,554
I preferred the part
where you appeared available.

725
00:54:27,864 --> 00:54:30,230
- Grow up.
- Don't you feel young over here?

726
00:54:30,333 --> 00:54:32,198
Just sitting in this truck?

727
00:54:33,904 --> 00:54:35,963
At Old Man Linton's? God!

728
00:54:39,876 --> 00:54:41,673
I feel like I'm 16 again.

729
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:48,347
Oh, get real, Justin.

730
00:55:18,415 --> 00:55:21,282
I never kissed a man
before Bill.

731
00:55:25,489 --> 00:55:26,922
Who said anything about kissin'?

732
00:55:28,891 --> 00:55:30,290
Did I say that?

733
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:57,847
But I still love to dance

734
00:55:57,987 --> 00:56:03,755
You know we used to dance
the night away

735
00:56:06,128 --> 00:56:07,356
Birdee Calvert.

736
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:11,728
Back when we were beautiful

737
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:22,133
Please, Daddy, come
and get me before it's too late.

738
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:35,924
- I don't feel so good, Grandma.
- Ohh...

739
00:56:37,927 --> 00:56:41,727
- You're going to school, Rocky.
- Man, it's not fair!

740
00:56:55,077 --> 00:56:56,305
Come on, Travis.

741
00:57:01,217 --> 00:57:04,845
Paper wings

742
00:57:07,222 --> 00:57:11,090
Autumn ending

743
00:57:14,729 --> 00:57:23,728
You made me feel that thing
was heaven-sent

744
00:57:46,661 --> 00:57:47,787
Four-eyes.

745
00:57:49,230 --> 00:57:52,097
Bookworm. Popeye.

746
00:57:53,801 --> 00:57:58,397
Angels will sing

747
00:58:19,427 --> 00:58:20,792
Fight! Fight! Fight!

748
00:58:36,511 --> 00:58:43,780
But how could I expect to fly

749
00:58:43,884 --> 00:58:49,914
With only paper wings?

750
00:58:50,090 --> 00:58:55,619
I tried to fly, but fell

751
00:58:55,762 --> 00:59:03,294
'Cause I had only paper wings

752
00:59:10,210 --> 00:59:13,077
Hey. How was school?

753
00:59:14,781 --> 00:59:15,873
Huh?

754
00:59:17,484 --> 00:59:19,008
- Hey, weasel.
- Fine.

755
00:59:21,388 --> 00:59:23,015
- What happened?
- She lived.

756
00:59:47,047 --> 00:59:51,313
I can turn the gray sky blue

757
00:59:51,485 --> 00:59:55,148
I can make it rain
whenever I want it to

758
00:59:55,255 --> 01:00:00,090
Oh, I can build a castle
from a single grain of sand

759
01:00:00,227 --> 01:00:04,527
I can make a ship sail
on dry land

760
01:00:04,698 --> 01:00:08,691
Ooh, but my life is incomplete,
and I'm so blue

761
01:00:08,835 --> 01:00:11,360
'Cause I can't get next to you

762
01:00:11,538 --> 01:00:12,903
Can't get next to you, babe

763
01:00:13,006 --> 01:00:14,234
Next to you

764
01:00:14,374 --> 01:00:17,036
I just can't get next to you

765
01:00:17,177 --> 01:00:19,610
No matter what I do,
I can't get next to you

766
01:00:19,779 --> 01:00:20,905
Ahh, yeah!

767
01:00:29,288 --> 01:00:31,654
Whoo whoo whoo

768
01:00:33,826 --> 01:00:36,158
Whoo whoo

769
01:00:38,197 --> 01:00:40,256
Chick-a-boom, chick-a-boom,
check 'em out, look out

770
01:00:41,801 --> 01:00:44,599
...what I need,
gotta get next to you

771
01:00:44,737 --> 01:00:49,106
Can't you see this little fact?
Gotta get next to you

772
01:00:51,343 --> 01:00:52,503
Take me back where I belong

773
01:00:58,350 --> 01:01:00,875
Back to Travis County

774
01:01:04,090 --> 01:01:06,456
I've been gone
for way too long

775
01:01:09,662 --> 01:01:12,756
Mr. And Mrs. Whitehead were
100 years old when I knew 'em.

776
01:01:23,242 --> 01:01:24,732
Uh... hi. Hi.

777
01:01:27,746 --> 01:01:29,043
Miss Ramona.

778
01:01:31,917 --> 01:01:35,216
- Did you want to dance with me?
- Oh, no.

779
01:01:35,321 --> 01:01:40,725
You go dance with someone
your own age. I never!

780
01:01:40,893 --> 01:01:43,919
- Sorry I bothered you.
- Well, all right, then.

781
01:01:45,397 --> 01:01:46,386
Excuse us, honey.

782
01:01:48,334 --> 01:01:51,963
Birdee? Birdee Pruitt?
It's me... Suzy.

783
01:01:52,104 --> 01:01:54,162
- Oh, my God! Hi!
- Hi!

784
01:01:54,305 --> 01:01:57,035
- How are you?
- Well... ha ha!

785
01:01:57,175 --> 01:01:59,040
- Oh, my God!
- Baby's due in six weeks.

786
01:01:59,177 --> 01:02:03,637
I can see that. I thought
you'd moved to Houston.

787
01:02:03,815 --> 01:02:07,046
I'm just in for the weekend.
Your mama said you were in town.

788
01:02:07,152 --> 01:02:10,121
- Yep, I'm here.
- You look wonderful.

789
01:02:10,255 --> 01:02:11,950
- Oh...
- Seriously.

790
01:02:12,123 --> 01:02:14,557
- Well, thank you.
- Aren't you clever?

791
01:02:14,692 --> 01:02:17,388
That's the way to get Bill
to come crawling back.

792
01:02:17,529 --> 01:02:19,690
Oh, I don't... that's...

793
01:02:20,832 --> 01:02:24,427
Would you look at Polka Dot?
The doughnut's best friend.

794
01:02:25,803 --> 01:02:28,567
Oh, look.
There's Justin Matisse.

795
01:02:29,307 --> 01:02:32,765
He lost that job in California.
Wouldn't work fast enough.

796
01:02:33,711 --> 01:02:35,178
Oops, he's headed this way.

797
01:02:37,782 --> 01:02:40,216
- Hey.
- Hey.

798
01:02:42,053 --> 01:02:43,247
Honor me?

799
01:02:44,589 --> 01:02:46,784
- What?
- I want to dance with you.

800
01:02:49,460 --> 01:02:52,224
- Justin, I can't.
- Excuse us.

801
01:02:54,799 --> 01:02:57,427
Justin, I can't dance anymore.

802
01:02:57,569 --> 01:03:01,699
Dancing's just a conversation
between two people. Talk to me.

803
01:03:05,210 --> 01:03:07,075
Yeah, I started feelin' funny

804
01:03:07,212 --> 01:03:11,012
When you walked
through that door

805
01:03:12,050 --> 01:03:13,677
And it ain't happened yet

806
01:03:14,786 --> 01:03:18,347
But I keep feelin'
that it'll happen

807
01:03:18,489 --> 01:03:21,947
If I keep comin' back for more

808
01:03:23,695 --> 01:03:25,060
You can do it, now.

809
01:03:31,235 --> 01:03:32,224
Whoo!

810
01:03:33,136 --> 01:03:34,160
Wow.

811
01:03:41,178 --> 01:03:42,611
Oh, we got it now.

812
01:03:48,485 --> 01:03:50,851
Come on, now. Come on, Birdee.

813
01:04:04,534 --> 01:04:07,128
Some kind of something happening

814
01:04:07,271 --> 01:04:09,501
I'm not sure

815
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:12,965
But I know it ain't been
a year now

816
01:04:13,076 --> 01:04:14,304
I'm feelin' it more

817
01:04:14,478 --> 01:04:15,638
Whoo-hoo!

818
01:04:16,346 --> 01:04:21,613
I started feelin' funny when
you walked through that door

819
01:04:21,785 --> 01:04:25,551
Well, it ain't happened yet

820
01:04:25,689 --> 01:04:28,123
But I'd be willin' to bet

821
01:04:28,225 --> 01:04:32,355
If it happened once,
I'd keep comin' back for more

822
01:04:41,638 --> 01:04:43,503
Thank you very much, folks.

823
01:04:44,107 --> 01:04:46,837
We're gonna take
a short break now,

824
01:04:46,977 --> 01:04:50,674
but we'll leave you with
some fine tunes on the jukebox.

825
01:04:50,847 --> 01:04:53,577
- Thanks for the dance.
- Hey, hey, hey.

826
01:04:54,851 --> 01:04:55,715
What?

827
01:04:58,121 --> 01:05:02,820
And
the whole world is on your case

828
01:05:04,294 --> 01:05:08,957
I would offer you a warm embrace

829
01:05:10,199 --> 01:05:13,430
To make you feel my love

830
01:05:16,605 --> 01:05:21,201
Evening shadows
and the stars appear

831
01:05:22,812 --> 01:05:29,274
There's no one there
to dry your tears

832
01:05:29,418 --> 01:05:30,680
Just breathe.

833
01:05:30,820 --> 01:05:33,584
...for a million years

834
01:05:34,890 --> 01:05:38,121
To make you feel my love

835
01:05:41,564 --> 01:05:45,933
I know you haven't
made your mind up yet

836
01:05:47,470 --> 01:05:50,667
But I would never do you wrong

837
01:05:53,843 --> 01:05:58,109
I've known it from the moment
that we met

838
01:05:59,715 --> 01:06:02,309
No doubt in my mind
where you belong

839
01:06:08,457 --> 01:06:09,754
Hey, be kind.

840
01:06:11,594 --> 01:06:13,391
It's a work in progress.

841
01:06:18,567 --> 01:06:20,091
It's beautiful.

842
01:06:25,408 --> 01:06:26,568
It's a door.

843
01:06:29,412 --> 01:06:30,709
Come on in.

844
01:06:39,155 --> 01:06:40,349
This is it.

845
01:07:15,890 --> 01:07:17,755
Nineteenth-century Texas pine.

846
01:07:22,130 --> 01:07:23,358
Love that smell.

847
01:07:27,202 --> 01:07:28,260
Feel this.

848
01:07:33,274 --> 01:07:34,206
It's tongue and groove.

849
01:07:36,344 --> 01:07:37,572
Excuse me?

850
01:07:41,549 --> 01:07:44,643
They're cut and matched perfect
to fit together.

851
01:07:47,589 --> 01:07:51,525
You, um... want to see the porch?

852
01:07:57,565 --> 01:07:58,725
It's this way.

853
01:08:03,605 --> 01:08:05,903
It'll have a great view
when the trailer's gone.

854
01:08:09,811 --> 01:08:11,676
This will wrap
all around the house.

855
01:08:21,388 --> 01:08:23,948
This is nice.
They call that a swing.

856
01:08:24,091 --> 01:08:25,456
Maybe you could hang it.

857
01:08:29,196 --> 01:08:33,758
Yeah, I could. This is from
Mom and Dad's old place.

858
01:08:33,901 --> 01:08:35,095
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

859
01:08:37,170 --> 01:08:38,762
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

860
01:08:41,975 --> 01:08:43,909
- It's comfy, huh?
- Yeah.

861
01:08:44,044 --> 01:08:49,243
This'll be a nice house, Justin.
Who was your architect?

862
01:08:49,416 --> 01:08:50,906
You kiddin', huh?

863
01:08:53,954 --> 01:08:56,115
That's half the fun.

864
01:08:56,223 --> 01:08:57,918
You go around Smithville
painting houses,

865
01:08:58,091 --> 01:08:59,353
and you can do this?

866
01:09:00,594 --> 01:09:03,859
- Yep.
- You could do so much more.

867
01:09:05,566 --> 01:09:08,797
- I guess so, huh.
- You know what I meant.

868
01:09:08,936 --> 01:09:12,633
I know exactly what you meant.
The American Dream.

869
01:09:15,409 --> 01:09:18,970
You find something you love,
then you twist and torture it...

870
01:09:20,547 --> 01:09:23,311
Trying to find a way
to make money at it.

871
01:09:23,450 --> 01:09:24,815
Spend a lifetime doing that.

872
01:09:27,220 --> 01:09:30,451
At the end, there's not a trace
of what you started out lovin'.

873
01:09:33,026 --> 01:09:34,425
What did you start out lovin'?

874
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:41,465
Don't remember.

875
01:09:41,602 --> 01:09:44,833
For me, it was doing
things right, that's all.

876
01:09:46,340 --> 01:09:49,867
That's why I came back, so
I could live the way I wanted.

877
01:09:50,010 --> 01:09:53,639
I figured out of everybody,
you'd understand that.

878
01:10:03,222 --> 01:10:04,348
I do.

879
01:10:05,825 --> 01:10:07,190
I envy you.

880
01:10:07,326 --> 01:10:10,921
Everything you love...
is right here.

881
01:10:15,935 --> 01:10:17,197
Not everything, Birdee.

882
01:10:21,641 --> 01:10:22,835
Hey, hey.

883
01:10:24,744 --> 01:10:26,507
- Justin, I can't...
- Shh.

884
01:10:45,798 --> 01:10:47,356
You are so beautiful.

885
01:10:57,043 --> 01:11:02,777
I'm not afraid of living alone

886
01:11:02,948 --> 01:11:07,783
I was alone before he came

887
01:11:11,691 --> 01:11:17,789
Don't have the strength
to fight anymore

888
01:11:17,930 --> 01:11:22,299
This time's not the same

889
01:11:25,671 --> 01:11:30,370
So tell me why I keep holding on

890
01:11:32,877 --> 01:11:37,576
To something I just cannot see

891
01:11:37,716 --> 01:11:40,048
What makes you stay

892
01:11:42,687 --> 01:11:45,554
When your world falls apart?

893
01:11:45,724 --> 01:11:53,256
What makes you try one more time
when it's not in your heart?

894
01:11:53,398 --> 01:11:56,367
At the end of your world

895
01:11:56,534 --> 01:12:00,197
When you can't find any hope

896
01:12:01,806 --> 01:12:05,572
You still look at him and say

897
01:12:07,746 --> 01:12:10,613
I just can't walk away

898
01:12:13,351 --> 01:12:23,488
Tell me, what makes you stay?

899
01:12:32,070 --> 01:12:34,038
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

900
01:12:47,385 --> 01:12:49,114
Mama?
Kitchen!

901
01:12:50,255 --> 01:12:52,951
- Where's Bernice?
- They ate hours ago.

902
01:12:53,091 --> 01:12:56,185
She had a face on her
like a bucket of worms.

903
01:12:56,327 --> 01:12:59,854
- I don't know what's going on.
- What's this?

904
01:13:00,031 --> 01:13:02,465
Nothing. I just invited Justin
over for dinner.

905
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:04,591
He sounded like he needed
some cheering up.

906
01:13:04,736 --> 01:13:08,570
- I don't want to see Justin.
- Justin is my friend.

907
01:13:08,706 --> 01:13:12,505
If he's down in the dumps,
and I feel like cheering him up,

908
01:13:12,643 --> 01:13:13,837
that's my business.

909
01:13:13,977 --> 01:13:16,775
This is not the time
for your matchmaking stunts.

910
01:13:16,914 --> 01:13:19,382
Matchmaking?
What an imagination.

911
01:13:19,550 --> 01:13:23,008
Oh, come on, Birdee.
Come on. Join us.

912
01:13:23,921 --> 01:13:26,947
You don't have to say anything.
You could just sit there.

913
01:13:27,090 --> 01:13:30,548
Maybe you could quietly chew
or something.

914
01:13:32,596 --> 01:13:35,087
There's nothing you can do
about it, sweetie.

915
01:13:35,199 --> 01:13:37,565
I'm going upstairs to sleep.

916
01:13:39,336 --> 01:13:42,794
All right. Birdee, this has
never been a rude house.

917
01:13:42,973 --> 01:13:45,066
Strange, perhaps,
but never rude.

918
01:13:45,209 --> 01:13:47,643
I would like you
to welcome our guest.

919
01:13:49,546 --> 01:13:51,309
I'm still your mama. Move it!

920
01:13:57,688 --> 01:13:58,848
Hello, Bernice.

921
01:14:01,191 --> 01:14:03,591
- These are for you.
- Thanks, but I'm allergic.

922
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:06,786
- Hey, Miss Calvert.
- Hey, Justin, glad to see you.

923
01:14:06,930 --> 01:14:08,261
- How you doin'?
- Good.

924
01:14:08,398 --> 01:14:10,263
I don't want these.
Bernice.

925
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:11,924
Thanks, anyway.

926
01:14:12,069 --> 01:14:13,536
- Hey, what's goin' on?
- Hey, Justin.

927
01:14:14,271 --> 01:14:17,729
Oh, my goodness! You've
been cookin', Miss Calvert.

928
01:14:17,875 --> 01:14:20,867
I hope you enjoy it.
Yes, indeed.

929
01:14:21,011 --> 01:14:24,538
Come on, let's all sit
down here now. That's fine.

930
01:14:30,020 --> 01:14:31,146
You're not joining us?

931
01:14:31,288 --> 01:14:34,746
I forgot I ate earlier
with the children.

932
01:14:34,925 --> 01:14:37,792
This memory's really goin'.

933
01:14:43,033 --> 01:14:44,500
Oh...

934
01:14:48,070 --> 01:14:49,264
Hmm...

935
01:14:52,041 --> 01:14:55,807
- Sorry about last night.
- I'm sorry about this morning.

936
01:15:00,249 --> 01:15:02,649
- I know you have a crush on me.
- A crush?

937
01:15:05,087 --> 01:15:08,784
- Birdee, this ain't high school.
- You know what I mean, Bill.

938
01:15:11,761 --> 01:15:12,887
Justin.

939
01:15:16,098 --> 01:15:17,759
- What?
- My name is Justin.

940
01:15:19,235 --> 01:15:20,395
It ain't Bill.

941
01:15:25,741 --> 01:15:28,676
- I'm sorry.
- You know, Birdee...

942
01:15:28,811 --> 01:15:30,802
You used to be so...

943
01:15:32,982 --> 01:15:34,142
I don't know...

944
01:15:35,818 --> 01:15:38,218
Audacious. Bold.

945
01:15:38,354 --> 01:15:40,720
People would stop to watch you
come down the street.

946
01:15:40,890 --> 01:15:42,824
"Here comes
that Birdee Calvert."

947
01:15:42,959 --> 01:15:45,450
Their eyes would light up.
You could see it on their faces.

948
01:15:46,429 --> 01:15:47,623
Look at me.

949
01:15:48,798 --> 01:15:52,029
You think you've lost that.
I can still see it.

950
01:15:53,970 --> 01:15:58,270
- Bill can't see that.
- You know nothing about Bill.

951
01:15:58,374 --> 01:16:01,707
I know that Bill could
let you go. Damn, Birdee!

952
01:16:01,811 --> 01:16:05,178
When are you gonna face the fact
that he ain't comin' back?

953
01:16:05,314 --> 01:16:07,680
Get out of here!
My daddy is coming back!

954
01:16:07,817 --> 01:16:09,682
He loves me,
and he wants my mother.

955
01:16:09,819 --> 01:16:11,787
He'll kill you
if you come around here.

956
01:16:11,921 --> 01:16:13,445
- Tell him!
- Be quiet.

957
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:19,619
- You better go.
- Yep.

958
01:16:19,762 --> 01:16:24,596
Why don't both of you go out?
Bernice and I will stay here.

959
01:16:24,733 --> 01:16:28,134
That's all right. When you're
tired of waiting, call me.

960
01:16:28,269 --> 01:16:30,601
I hope I'm still around.
Thanks, Miss Calvert.

961
01:16:35,310 --> 01:16:38,245
You just amaze me,
Birdee.

962
01:16:38,413 --> 01:16:41,473
Your love life has always been
a disaster area.

963
01:16:41,616 --> 01:16:44,449
They ought to have
big orange cones all around you.

964
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:49,617
What can I say?
I'm my own crown of thorns.

965
01:16:49,758 --> 01:16:52,625
Hey, you think
life goes on forever?

966
01:16:53,862 --> 01:16:57,628
You think behind every chance
there's another one?

967
01:16:58,433 --> 01:17:01,664
It's the worst kind of
extravagance, spending chances.

968
01:17:03,171 --> 01:17:05,036
Get out of here,
Don't come back!

969
01:17:05,206 --> 01:17:06,332
Bernice!

970
01:17:11,679 --> 01:17:15,115
Bernice, stop it!
What's the matter with you?

971
01:17:15,250 --> 01:17:17,718
Why didn't you tell him
he loves us?

972
01:17:17,852 --> 01:17:19,820
Oh, God, Bernice,
because I don't know.

973
01:17:19,954 --> 01:17:22,889
I don't know if Daddy loves us
or if he's coming back.

974
01:17:23,024 --> 01:17:26,016
He loves me,
even if he doesn't love you!

975
01:17:26,161 --> 01:17:28,891
Oh, I just sent him away.
What more do you want?

976
01:17:29,064 --> 01:17:32,898
I want my Daddy. He left because
you didn't love him enough.

977
01:17:33,034 --> 01:17:34,899
No, Bernice, your daddy
didn't love me enough.

978
01:17:35,070 --> 01:17:36,765
You know this is all your fault.

979
01:17:44,479 --> 01:17:46,606
Whoa... whoa, whoa, whoa!

980
01:17:48,716 --> 01:17:50,047
Aunt Birdee, help! Please?

981
01:17:51,553 --> 01:17:54,420
Somebody? I've fallen over,
and I can't get up! Help!

982
01:17:54,823 --> 01:17:57,087
You know,
that is the prettiest one.

983
01:18:01,695 --> 01:18:03,492
Birdee Calvert.

984
01:18:04,198 --> 01:18:06,359
She looks like
she belongs in a bar.

985
01:18:06,533 --> 01:18:09,627
Hello, Birdee.
It's about time you said hi.

986
01:18:09,770 --> 01:18:11,863
- Hey, Mike.
- You being good?

987
01:18:12,873 --> 01:18:16,274
I'm trying to be, but it doesn't
seem to be working out that way.

988
01:18:17,978 --> 01:18:20,970
Uh, can I get a vodka tonic,
extra lime, please?

989
01:18:21,115 --> 01:18:22,446
- Sure, you may.
- Thanks.

990
01:18:22,616 --> 01:18:25,551
Senior citizens
in a convalescent home.

991
01:18:25,686 --> 01:18:28,177
Raquel, what do you want
to say to Damius?

992
01:18:28,288 --> 01:18:30,916
You know how
I get calls really late?

993
01:18:33,093 --> 01:18:35,561
Just say it. What?
When they call me...

994
01:18:35,729 --> 01:18:38,197
It's on me.
They call me to dance.

995
01:18:39,166 --> 01:18:43,500
I'm really an exotic dancer.

996
01:18:44,238 --> 01:18:48,368
Raquel... you shouldn't
have done this on TV.

997
01:18:57,251 --> 01:19:00,880
I mean, "Birdee."
What kind of name is... what...

998
01:19:01,021 --> 01:19:02,511
You know what happens
to birdies?

999
01:19:02,689 --> 01:19:05,681
They're cat food
or target practice.

1000
01:19:05,826 --> 01:19:07,817
Birdee. Birdee. Birdee!

1001
01:19:07,961 --> 01:19:13,797
It's a good name.
Have some coffee. Pace yourself.

1002
01:19:13,934 --> 01:19:16,164
- I'm fine. I'm gonna go home.
- You sure?

1003
01:19:16,303 --> 01:19:18,032
- Mm-hmm.
- OK.

1004
01:19:18,172 --> 01:19:22,199
Don't let me
get like that, for God's sakes!

1005
01:19:25,245 --> 01:19:28,339
Pretty pathetic, huh?
Uh-huh!

1006
01:19:28,515 --> 01:19:32,042
Poor woman. Husband leaves her
on national television.

1007
01:19:32,152 --> 01:19:33,551
I know. We cried.

1008
01:19:35,055 --> 01:19:37,682
Do not believe
everything you see, all right?

1009
01:19:38,624 --> 01:19:42,185
If I believed everything
I saw down at the photo shop...

1010
01:19:43,596 --> 01:19:47,589
I'd believe Miss Bobbi-Claire
got herself some new titties.

1011
01:19:51,871 --> 01:19:55,398
I got one word for y'all:
Polaroids.

1012
01:19:55,575 --> 01:20:01,241
Polaroid... oh, come on!
Bobbi-Claire, don't leave.

1013
01:20:01,347 --> 01:20:04,976
- Come on! You won!
- Take it easy, Birdee.

1014
01:20:05,117 --> 01:20:07,415
Que sera, sera, people.

1015
01:20:14,961 --> 01:20:17,395
Birdee, are you OK?

1016
01:20:19,599 --> 01:20:22,864
Whatever you do,
please don't say anything.

1017
01:20:23,002 --> 01:20:27,530
Don't be clever, don't be smart,
'cause I can't take it tonight.

1018
01:20:28,608 --> 01:20:29,836
Sit on that.

1019
01:20:32,378 --> 01:20:34,778
The tiles are always
so cold in this bathroom.

1020
01:20:38,618 --> 01:20:41,246
Everything's so wrong
without Bill.

1021
01:20:42,955 --> 01:20:46,618
I know.
I miss him so much.

1022
01:20:46,759 --> 01:20:48,920
He used to call me "baby."

1023
01:20:49,061 --> 01:20:55,159
I never thought I'd like that,
but I did... with him.

1024
01:20:55,301 --> 01:20:56,563
Sure, you do.

1025
01:20:58,404 --> 01:20:59,769
I miss his hands.

1026
01:21:01,607 --> 01:21:07,045
I miss the way he would put them
on the small of my back...

1027
01:21:07,146 --> 01:21:09,239
and lead me into a room.

1028
01:21:10,683 --> 01:21:12,274
It made me feel so safe.

1029
01:21:14,953 --> 01:21:16,887
I miss all that.

1030
01:21:17,022 --> 01:21:19,115
- Of course you do.
- Uh-huh.

1031
01:21:20,258 --> 01:21:25,696
You know, it's so easy to
believe him, but you know what?

1032
01:21:25,864 --> 01:21:29,356
I think it's me.
I do, because...

1033
01:21:30,902 --> 01:21:35,601
He used to look at me,
and I'd see myself in his eyes,

1034
01:21:35,740 --> 01:21:37,605
and it was like he saw me.

1035
01:21:38,743 --> 01:21:44,147
And I was audacious, Mama.
I was. And then...

1036
01:21:45,583 --> 01:21:48,143
Things started to change.

1037
01:21:48,253 --> 01:21:51,552
The harder I'd try to be
what he wanted me to be,

1038
01:21:51,723 --> 01:21:53,884
the less I saw myself
in his eyes.

1039
01:21:55,627 --> 01:21:59,324
One day I looked,
and I was gone.

1040
01:22:02,300 --> 01:22:05,497
- I still see her.
- No, Mama, no.

1041
01:22:05,637 --> 01:22:08,162
No, it's happening
with Bernice, too.

1042
01:22:08,306 --> 01:22:10,274
It's happening with Bernice.

1043
01:22:10,442 --> 01:22:12,774
She doesn't look at me
the same way.

1044
01:22:13,845 --> 01:22:17,406
It's like there's
a wall between us.

1045
01:22:17,582 --> 01:22:19,846
There's a wall,
and it's killing me,

1046
01:22:19,951 --> 01:22:23,512
'cause the one thing I said
when I grow up,

1047
01:22:23,688 --> 01:22:25,918
if I ever had
a daughter of my own,

1048
01:22:26,057 --> 01:22:29,618
she would know her mother
loved her, and I would hug her,

1049
01:22:29,761 --> 01:22:32,161
and I would tell her
nice things,

1050
01:22:32,297 --> 01:22:35,664
and I wouldn't just let
the daddy do all the hugging.

1051
01:22:47,245 --> 01:22:51,476
And I know. I realize
that it doesn't matter...

1052
01:22:53,050 --> 01:22:58,545
...who or what or when
or where the hugging happens.

1053
01:22:59,790 --> 01:23:01,382
Sometimes you just need a hug.

1054
01:23:02,993 --> 01:23:05,587
And it just hasn't
worked out that way.

1055
01:23:05,729 --> 01:23:07,162
You know, I...

1056
01:23:10,601 --> 01:23:12,159
I've seen you hug
your daughter.

1057
01:23:18,876 --> 01:23:20,275
She knows you love her.

1058
01:23:23,547 --> 01:23:26,311
Yeah, mothers love
their daughters.

1059
01:23:28,619 --> 01:23:30,587
Even if they show it poorly.

1060
01:24:07,991 --> 01:24:10,482
Hi, Julia.
Here's the talent show list.

1061
01:24:11,829 --> 01:24:14,423
It's up!
The audition list is up!

1062
01:24:14,565 --> 01:24:17,693
I hope I'm near the beginning.
I'm so nervous.

1063
01:24:18,769 --> 01:24:19,827
Bernice!

1064
01:24:28,211 --> 01:24:29,838
Ber... Bernice!

1065
01:24:30,746 --> 01:24:34,978
I was gonna do a poem.
They don't like too many poems.

1066
01:24:35,084 --> 01:24:36,449
Hey...
Hey, Birdee.

1067
01:24:36,619 --> 01:24:39,679
- Hey, Chris. How are you?
- Fine. What's up?

1068
01:24:39,822 --> 01:24:42,814
I was wondering if you could...
Bernice!

1069
01:24:43,893 --> 01:24:46,828
- Bernice, honey!
- Isn't that your mom?

1070
01:24:52,034 --> 01:24:53,467
Sweetheart!

1071
01:24:57,740 --> 01:24:58,536
Let's go.

1072
01:25:06,949 --> 01:25:09,076
Could you give this to her?
She forgot it.

1073
01:25:09,218 --> 01:25:12,654
- I'll make sure she gets it.
- Thanks. Good to see you again.

1074
01:25:29,972 --> 01:25:34,375
When
the rain is blowin' in your face

1075
01:25:36,078 --> 01:25:40,139
And the whole world
is on your case

1076
01:25:41,884 --> 01:25:46,116
I could offer you a warm embrace

1077
01:25:47,523 --> 01:25:51,550
To make you feel my love

1078
01:25:53,462 --> 01:25:58,456
When evening shadows
and the stars appear

1079
01:26:04,472 --> 01:26:05,632
And there is no one
to dry your tears

1080
01:26:05,707 --> 01:26:10,542
I could hold you
for a million years

1081
01:26:11,379 --> 01:26:16,510
To make you feel my love

1082
01:26:26,061 --> 01:26:27,255
Hey, Daddy.

1083
01:26:34,636 --> 01:26:37,366
- Do you remember who I am?
- Hello.

1084
01:26:39,107 --> 01:26:40,233
Hi.

1085
01:26:42,711 --> 01:26:44,008
Isn't she beautiful?

1086
01:26:47,916 --> 01:26:52,353
- Yes, sir, she sure is.
- That's my daughter... Birdee.

1087
01:26:53,521 --> 01:26:57,890
- She's marked for happiness.
- How do you know that?

1088
01:26:57,993 --> 01:27:00,985
If you'll look at her, child,
you'll see it.

1089
01:27:05,734 --> 01:27:07,065
By God, you're right.

1090
01:27:09,371 --> 01:27:10,531
I see it.

1091
01:27:24,119 --> 01:27:26,917
Hey, honey,
your mom called a while ago.

1092
01:27:27,055 --> 01:27:30,582
She said she'd be home soon.
You want me to tuck you in?

1093
01:27:31,693 --> 01:27:35,424
- Yep? How tight?
- Tight.

1094
01:27:35,563 --> 01:27:40,556
OK. Snug as a bug in a rug.

1095
01:27:42,002 --> 01:27:43,162
You're just like your mama.

1096
01:27:43,270 --> 01:27:46,433
She used to love me
to tuck her in real tight.

1097
01:27:48,342 --> 01:27:51,971
I'm not like her.
We're different.

1098
01:27:52,146 --> 01:27:54,011
It's like we're
not even relatives.

1099
01:27:54,148 --> 01:27:58,915
Ah, well... yeah. Yeah.
I know what you mean.

1100
01:28:00,554 --> 01:28:03,352
Relatives are trouble.
I couldn't agree more.

1101
01:28:04,491 --> 01:28:08,655
I ever tell you about Walter,
my brother? No? Well...

1102
01:28:09,830 --> 01:28:12,993
What you have to go through
with your mama, the suffering,

1103
01:28:13,100 --> 01:28:15,193
that's what I had to suffer
with Walter.

1104
01:28:16,103 --> 01:28:18,970
One day, we were playing
down by the river,

1105
01:28:19,139 --> 01:28:23,974
and we came across the most
beautiful anthill you ever saw.

1106
01:28:25,112 --> 01:28:28,343
And bein' Walter,
he immediately kicked it...

1107
01:28:28,515 --> 01:28:32,349
and stomped on it, just
scattering it to the four winds.

1108
01:28:32,519 --> 01:28:33,986
I just started howling.

1109
01:28:34,088 --> 01:28:36,579
I was just...
I yelled for my mama.

1110
01:28:36,757 --> 01:28:38,918
I grabbed her
and dragged her down there,

1111
01:28:39,026 --> 01:28:40,425
just crying and carrying on.

1112
01:28:41,628 --> 01:28:45,587
Anyway, my mama was trying
to calm me down, so she said,

1113
01:28:45,733 --> 01:28:49,999
"Wait, wait. They're not
finished, not by a long shot."

1114
01:28:50,137 --> 01:28:53,538
And we waited and waited,
and sure enough,

1115
01:28:53,674 --> 01:28:59,237
those little black specks
started scurrying everywhere,

1116
01:28:59,413 --> 01:29:02,507
just working hard
to build their home back.

1117
01:29:03,417 --> 01:29:06,250
And I said, "Why did they do it?
I'd just give up.

1118
01:29:06,386 --> 01:29:08,081
I mean, it's hopeless."

1119
01:29:09,123 --> 01:29:13,583
And my mama said, "Yeah,
if there was just one ant.

1120
01:29:13,761 --> 01:29:15,421
"But there's lots of ants
down there.

1121
01:29:15,561 --> 01:29:17,961
"They're all relatives.

1122
01:29:18,064 --> 01:29:20,658
They're family,
just like we are."

1123
01:29:21,768 --> 01:29:24,635
Well, that's
what families are for.

1124
01:29:24,804 --> 01:29:27,068
That's why
they invented families...

1125
01:29:27,206 --> 01:29:29,470
so "hopeless"
didn't get the last word.

1126
01:29:30,610 --> 01:29:34,307
So if ants can do it,
I figure we can do it.

1127
01:29:38,618 --> 01:29:43,248
You know, my Birdee has a lot
more strength than she knows.

1128
01:29:44,590 --> 01:29:48,048
And... one of these days,
she's going to realize that.

1129
01:29:53,633 --> 01:29:58,093
- I love you, Grandma.
- Oh... oh, honey. Honey.

1130
01:30:01,040 --> 01:30:02,371
My cup runneth over.

1131
01:30:11,350 --> 01:30:14,808
Say, haven't you got a birthday
comin' up pretty soon?

1132
01:30:15,822 --> 01:30:17,687
Want to tell Grandma
what you wish for?

1133
01:30:18,724 --> 01:30:20,214
- No?
- No.

1134
01:30:20,326 --> 01:30:21,350
No?

1135
01:30:21,527 --> 01:30:25,054
Well, never mind.
I'll figure that out.

1136
01:30:25,164 --> 01:30:28,190
I have my magic ways.

1137
01:30:30,336 --> 01:30:32,167
- Good night, honey.
- Good night.

1138
01:30:43,649 --> 01:30:47,585
Oh, Birdee!
When did you get home?

1139
01:30:47,720 --> 01:30:52,679
Oh, a while ago.
I went to go see Daddy.

1140
01:30:52,824 --> 01:30:54,655
- That's nice.
- Yeah.

1141
01:30:55,527 --> 01:30:56,960
You were always Daddy's girl.

1142
01:31:00,031 --> 01:31:01,498
Not just his, Mama.

1143
01:31:04,302 --> 01:31:05,394
Thank you.

1144
01:31:09,441 --> 01:31:12,569
Well... you're most welcome.

1145
01:31:17,816 --> 01:31:20,114
I'm gonna get some tea.
You want some?

1146
01:31:20,252 --> 01:31:21,719
No, I'm OK. Thanks.

1147
01:32:03,628 --> 01:32:06,290
- Grandma? Grandma?
- Mama?

1148
01:32:08,333 --> 01:32:10,130
- Grandma!
- Mama.

1149
01:32:11,036 --> 01:32:13,903
Mama? Mama, what's up?
What's wrong, Mama?

1150
01:32:14,873 --> 01:32:19,139
Oh, God, Mama.
Bernice, go dial 911.

1151
01:32:19,277 --> 01:32:20,938
Mama... this isn't
happening to me.

1152
01:32:21,079 --> 01:32:24,173
Come on. Not now, Mama.
Don't do this to me now.

1153
01:32:24,316 --> 01:32:28,513
Don't do this to me now.
Wake up, Mama. Mama, wake up!

1154
01:32:28,686 --> 01:32:31,484
Wake up! Mama. Mama, please!

1155
01:32:31,622 --> 01:32:38,460
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.
Oh, God. No, no, no, no...

1156
01:34:11,654 --> 01:34:14,646
Privileged to have known
Ramona Calvert all my life.

1157
01:34:15,792 --> 01:34:18,852
She doesn't need to be
idealized in death...

1158
01:34:18,995 --> 01:34:20,690
beyond what she was in life.

1159
01:34:22,098 --> 01:34:26,728
A complicated woman
and a generous one, proud,

1160
01:34:26,869 --> 01:34:31,568
and yet humble enough to help
many of her neighbors quietly.

1161
01:34:32,875 --> 01:34:35,343
The mother
of two fine daughters,

1162
01:34:35,511 --> 01:34:37,706
and the wife of one good man.

1163
01:34:37,814 --> 01:34:42,444
She doesn't require any fancy
words from the likes of me.

1164
01:34:42,618 --> 01:34:46,714
All I need to say is,
we'll all miss her.

1165
01:34:47,757 --> 01:34:51,215
And I know, even seated
next to our father...

1166
01:34:51,327 --> 01:34:54,819
Daddy came back for us!
He came back.

1167
01:34:54,997 --> 01:34:57,966
Thank you, Grandma.
May she rest in peace.

1168
01:34:59,168 --> 01:35:02,604
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit...

1169
01:35:02,772 --> 01:35:04,637
Amen.
May God be with you.

1170
01:35:04,774 --> 01:35:06,969
And also with you.

1171
01:35:14,617 --> 01:35:16,778
Daddy, I knew you'd come back!
I knew it!

1172
01:35:17,653 --> 01:35:20,087
Take it easy.
You're chokin' me.

1173
01:35:20,189 --> 01:35:21,713
Let's get a look at you.

1174
01:35:27,130 --> 01:35:29,530
- What are you doing?
- Taking it home.

1175
01:35:29,699 --> 01:35:33,533
- OK. Hey.
- You doin' all right?

1176
01:35:33,669 --> 01:35:34,795
Yeah.

1177
01:35:35,838 --> 01:35:36,896
Thanks.

1178
01:35:39,408 --> 01:35:40,738
Want to see Mama?

1179
01:36:05,167 --> 01:36:06,134
Hey, Travis.

1180
01:36:10,071 --> 01:36:11,595
Mind if I sit down?

1181
01:36:26,221 --> 01:36:29,088
Birdee, why don't you sit down?
That can wait.

1182
01:36:29,224 --> 01:36:30,384
OK.

1183
01:36:32,827 --> 01:36:35,387
Would you like any sugar
or cream with that?

1184
01:36:35,530 --> 01:36:36,724
I'm fine.

1185
01:36:38,934 --> 01:36:40,492
Want anything, sweetheart?

1186
01:36:40,635 --> 01:36:42,227
- I'm good.
- Yeah? OK.

1187
01:36:47,642 --> 01:36:48,939
You got a telegram.

1188
01:36:53,048 --> 01:36:54,777
I waited my whole life
to get one.

1189
01:36:56,451 --> 01:36:57,713
Still ain't had one.

1190
01:37:02,424 --> 01:37:03,686
It's from your mom.

1191
01:37:07,562 --> 01:37:10,895
She must care about you a lot
to send you a telegram.

1192
01:37:13,201 --> 01:37:14,463
It's for Aunt Birdee.

1193
01:37:18,239 --> 01:37:19,365
Even so.

1194
01:37:23,077 --> 01:37:24,339
What you thinkin' about?

1195
01:37:26,647 --> 01:37:28,012
Whether Aunt Birdee wants me.

1196
01:37:32,119 --> 01:37:33,279
Yeah, she does.

1197
01:37:38,192 --> 01:37:39,386
My grandma's dead.

1198
01:37:47,167 --> 01:37:48,293
I know.

1199
01:37:51,138 --> 01:37:53,106
Birdee, don't make me
feel bad about this.

1200
01:37:54,675 --> 01:37:56,438
Only thing I'm guilty of
is falling in love.

1201
01:37:57,278 --> 01:38:00,179
I didn't want it to happen.
I didn't seek it out, Birdee.

1202
01:38:00,347 --> 01:38:02,212
- It just happened.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1203
01:38:02,383 --> 01:38:04,010
Are you talking about me
or Connie?

1204
01:38:04,118 --> 01:38:08,145
You seem to fall in love easily,
so it's natural to be confused.

1205
01:38:10,291 --> 01:38:13,124
- Here you go, Daddy.
- I told you to play outside.

1206
01:38:14,161 --> 01:38:17,153
- I will when you stop fighting.
- We're not fightin'.

1207
01:38:17,298 --> 01:38:21,257
- Nobody's fightin' here.
- Nope. Never did, did you?

1208
01:38:21,435 --> 01:38:24,404
Lies always came really easy
to you, didn't they. Real easy.

1209
01:38:25,406 --> 01:38:29,433
Almost as easy as discarding
your wife and child.

1210
01:38:29,543 --> 01:38:31,909
Kind of like a to-do list.

1211
01:38:32,046 --> 01:38:35,777
Wife's gone... check.
Daughter's gone... check, check.

1212
01:38:35,916 --> 01:38:38,441
- Birdee, you left. Remember?
- No.

1213
01:38:39,720 --> 01:38:42,052
You left long before I left you.

1214
01:38:42,156 --> 01:38:44,181
This isn't about
who left first, Birdee.

1215
01:38:45,426 --> 01:38:46,950
We're not in love anymore.

1216
01:38:48,028 --> 01:38:49,461
You said
you weren't gonna fight.

1217
01:38:50,431 --> 01:38:53,593
Bernice, if you don't get out of
this house, you'll wish you had.

1218
01:38:54,701 --> 01:38:56,100
Don't you ruin anything!

1219
01:38:58,271 --> 01:39:00,762
Look, if you fell
out of love with me,

1220
01:39:00,907 --> 01:39:02,272
you should've left long ago...

1221
01:39:02,442 --> 01:39:04,171
instead of skirtin' around
behind my back.

1222
01:39:06,612 --> 01:39:08,011
Maybe I'll go there one day.

1223
01:39:10,983 --> 01:39:13,816
- Where's that?
- California.

1224
01:39:15,421 --> 01:39:16,683
To see my mom.

1225
01:39:19,759 --> 01:39:21,192
I'm sure she'd like that.

1226
01:39:23,296 --> 01:39:24,354
Yeah.

1227
01:39:28,735 --> 01:39:30,760
How come you're out here
all by yourself?

1228
01:39:33,139 --> 01:39:36,973
- Where's that crazy Bernice?
- She's inside with her father.

1229
01:39:41,147 --> 01:39:43,638
- Everything's OK, right?
- Yeah.

1230
01:39:45,151 --> 01:39:46,516
What you feel like doin'?

1231
01:39:48,087 --> 01:39:51,545
- Want to go for a walk?
- Aren't you going to say hi?

1232
01:39:54,494 --> 01:39:55,688
Don't you know?

1233
01:39:57,463 --> 01:40:00,557
- I came over to say hi to you.
- Hi.

1234
01:40:01,300 --> 01:40:04,394
God, I would've stayed
with you forever.

1235
01:40:06,272 --> 01:40:10,106
I would've turned myself
inside out for you.

1236
01:40:10,243 --> 01:40:11,904
Birdee,
I wouldn't have let you.

1237
01:40:14,080 --> 01:40:17,072
People grow. They change.
They have to.

1238
01:40:17,216 --> 01:40:18,615
You don't think I know that?

1239
01:40:21,788 --> 01:40:24,916
I know that I'm not
what I once was.

1240
01:40:26,058 --> 01:40:27,218
I know that.

1241
01:40:28,761 --> 01:40:30,284
But neither are you.

1242
01:40:31,229 --> 01:40:32,856
You're sad, you're weak,
and you're... you're shorter,

1243
01:40:37,169 --> 01:40:38,602
if you want to know the truth.

1244
01:40:39,004 --> 01:40:44,169
But I haven't changed so much
that I'd lie to someone I loved.

1245
01:40:44,309 --> 01:40:49,474
I'd walk through fire before I'd
let them feel they were nothin'.

1246
01:40:51,616 --> 01:40:54,744
And I would never break up
anybody's home.

1247
01:40:55,720 --> 01:40:59,622
Because I am not a quitter.
I care about my family.

1248
01:41:00,525 --> 01:41:01,890
I'm in love with Connie.

1249
01:41:04,162 --> 01:41:08,030
This is my chance for a fresh
start, and I'm takin' it.

1250
01:41:08,200 --> 01:41:09,599
Then you should take it.

1251
01:41:11,870 --> 01:41:13,531
If that's your chance,
then you should take it.

1252
01:41:14,940 --> 01:41:17,272
You're right. You and Connie
deserve each other.

1253
01:41:18,410 --> 01:41:22,642
You were lucky to have me.
But you know what?

1254
01:41:22,747 --> 01:41:25,978
I think I already got
the best part of you.

1255
01:41:29,588 --> 01:41:33,251
She's standing right out there,
and she's waitin' for me.

1256
01:41:34,426 --> 01:41:38,886
What's left over
doesn't look so good anymore.

1257
01:41:40,765 --> 01:41:45,327
So why'd you come back?
You want my permission?

1258
01:41:47,606 --> 01:41:51,872
You want my condolences?
Why'd you come back?

1259
01:41:54,112 --> 01:41:57,980
I didn't want to do this today,
but I want a divorce, Birdee.

1260
01:42:01,319 --> 01:42:02,684
I'm coming with you, Daddy!

1261
01:42:30,814 --> 01:42:32,941
Bernice?
I'm going with Daddy.

1262
01:42:38,889 --> 01:42:41,414
Bernice, what do you think
you're doin'?

1263
01:42:41,592 --> 01:42:44,789
- I'm going with you.
- Honey, that's impossible.

1264
01:42:45,863 --> 01:42:48,923
- But I'm going with you.
- You gotta stay with your mama.

1265
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:51,490
Birdee, you gonna help me out?

1266
01:42:52,870 --> 01:42:55,600
You told me you wanted me
with you, remember?

1267
01:42:55,739 --> 01:42:57,798
Listen, honey, I've got to go.

1268
01:42:59,310 --> 01:43:03,337
Don't do this to yourself, OK?
Don't make a scene.

1269
01:43:03,514 --> 01:43:05,072
Go on back inside. Go ahead.

1270
01:43:18,295 --> 01:43:19,592
Stop it, Daddy!

1271
01:43:20,631 --> 01:43:24,362
Bernice, you know I'd take you
with me if I could.

1272
01:43:24,501 --> 01:43:26,662
- You can!
- Try to understand, baby.

1273
01:43:27,738 --> 01:43:31,435
Connie and I need this time to
ourselves, to make a go of it.

1274
01:43:31,575 --> 01:43:35,033
Then I'll come back for you.
I promise, I promise!

1275
01:43:35,179 --> 01:43:36,806
Now, go on inside, please!

1276
01:43:40,417 --> 01:43:42,851
You want me!
You wrote it in a letter!

1277
01:43:42,952 --> 01:43:46,513
Please... let me in!
You want me!

1278
01:43:46,689 --> 01:43:50,216
I'll always want you, Bernice.
You're my little princess.

1279
01:43:50,326 --> 01:43:52,817
- No.
- But your mama needs you.

1280
01:43:52,962 --> 01:43:54,589
- No!
- And you need her.

1281
01:43:54,764 --> 01:43:57,961
No, I don't! I need you!

1282
01:43:58,067 --> 01:43:59,591
- I love you, princess.
- Please!

1283
01:43:59,769 --> 01:44:02,237
- I gotta go.
- No! No!

1284
01:44:03,873 --> 01:44:08,469
Daddy! Daddy! Please! Daddy!

1285
01:44:08,611 --> 01:44:14,072
Daddy! Daddy!

1286
01:44:27,764 --> 01:44:29,732
I want my daddy!

1287
01:44:43,212 --> 01:44:45,544
Why did you pretend
that letter was from Daddy?

1288
01:44:47,650 --> 01:44:49,083
What an imagination you have.

1289
01:44:52,922 --> 01:44:59,953
You know, I always thought that
I was going to be... special.

1290
01:45:01,164 --> 01:45:07,194
But I'm not. I'm just...
just an ordinary person.

1291
01:45:09,472 --> 01:45:10,734
And that's OK.

1292
01:45:13,142 --> 01:45:16,305
Because you make me special.

1293
01:45:19,681 --> 01:45:20,943
Don't you know that?

1294
01:45:23,118 --> 01:45:26,315
Don't you know you are
everything in this world to me?

1295
01:45:30,025 --> 01:45:35,190
And we'll make it through this
because... we are a team.

1296
01:45:37,966 --> 01:45:42,027
Birdee and Bernice, the coolest
chicks in Smithville.

1297
01:45:46,908 --> 01:45:48,967
Don't ever think about
leaving me again.

1298
01:45:52,581 --> 01:45:53,878
Because I need you.

1299
01:45:58,587 --> 01:45:59,645
I love you.

1300
01:46:01,957 --> 01:46:04,255
- Me, too.
- Good.

1301
01:46:23,912 --> 01:46:23,934
Bad dog!
Very bad dog!

1302
01:46:38,927 --> 01:46:41,760
Anything interesting come in
while I was at lunch?

1303
01:46:41,930 --> 01:46:43,090
No, sir.

1304
01:46:46,134 --> 01:46:49,331
Oh! Oh, no! Look at these.

1305
01:46:49,504 --> 01:46:51,438
- Birdee?
- No!

1306
01:46:51,573 --> 01:46:56,066
What's wrong with this stupid
machine? God, I tell you, I'd...

1307
01:47:13,561 --> 01:47:16,121
When you love someone

1308
01:47:17,932 --> 01:47:20,423
You'll do anything

1309
01:47:20,568 --> 01:47:22,536
OK, Mama, stop pushin'.

1310
01:47:22,670 --> 01:47:25,798
You'll do all the crazy things

1311
01:47:27,208 --> 01:47:29,267
That you can't explain

1312
01:47:31,779 --> 01:47:33,644
You'll shoot the moon

1313
01:47:36,050 --> 01:47:37,984
Put out the sun

1314
01:47:40,020 --> 01:47:41,954
When you love someone

1315
01:47:48,829 --> 01:47:50,990
You'll deny the truth

1316
01:47:53,467 --> 01:47:55,264
Believe a lie

1317
01:47:56,904 --> 01:48:00,465
There'll be times
that you believe

1318
01:48:01,442 --> 01:48:03,774
That you can really fly

1319
01:48:05,946 --> 01:48:08,141
That your lonely nights

1320
01:48:10,684 --> 01:48:12,948
Have just begun

1321
01:48:14,488 --> 01:48:16,285
When you love someone

1322
01:48:22,997 --> 01:48:24,487
And when you love someone

1323
01:48:27,501 --> 01:48:29,935
You feel it deep inside

1324
01:48:30,070 --> 01:48:31,094
Y'all ready?

1325
01:48:31,205 --> 01:48:34,298
Go ahead. I want to talk
to Bernice for a second.

1326
01:48:34,474 --> 01:48:37,409
Aah!
Vroom!

1327
01:48:37,543 --> 01:48:39,477
You're stuck with us now, buddy.

1328
01:48:41,915 --> 01:48:43,177
What are you lookin' at?

1329
01:48:46,678 --> 01:48:49,178
My cup runneth over.

1330
01:48:55,579 --> 01:48:57,179
- Mom?
- What?

1331
01:48:57,180 --> 01:48:58,980
Are you gonna marry Justin Matisse?

1332
01:48:59,581 --> 01:49:02,481
Oh honey, I don't think I'm gonna get
married for quite some time.

1333
01:49:03,382 --> 01:49:04,382
Why? You don't like Justin?

1334
01:49:04,883 --> 01:49:09,183
It's not that.
It's just....

1335
01:49:09,584 --> 01:49:10,584
What is it?

1336
01:49:13,085 --> 01:49:14,185
You can be honest with me.
Tell me.

1337
01:49:15,086 --> 01:49:18,086
I just don't want to be known
as Bernise Mathisse.

1338
01:49:20,087 --> 01:49:24,887
Oh god Bernise.
You are a fun girl, you know that?

1339
01:49:25,488 --> 01:49:27,088
I never said any different.

1340
01:49:30,389 --> 01:49:34,289
My dad says that childhood is
the happiest time of my life.

1341
01:49:34,890 --> 01:49:38,390
But I think he is wrong.
I think my mom's right.

1342
01:49:38,391 --> 01:49:43,791
She says that: 'Childhood is what you spend
the rest of your life trying to overcome'.

1343
01:49:44,892 --> 01:49:47,292
That's what momma used to say.

1344
01:49:47,293 --> 01:49:53,293
She said: 'Beginnings are scary, endings are
usually sad, but it's the middle that counts the most'.

1345
01:49:53,694 --> 01:49:56,594
You need to remember that
when you find yourself at the beginning.

1346
01:49:57,495 --> 01:49:58,995
Just give hope as chance to float up.

1347
01:50:00,096 --> 01:50:01,196
And it will too.

1348
01:50:10,197 --> 01:50:16,697
When you love someone.
