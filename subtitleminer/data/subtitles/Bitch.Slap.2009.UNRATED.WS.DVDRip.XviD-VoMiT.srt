A belief in a supernatural
source of evil is not necessary;

2
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:46,539
men alone are quite capable
of every wickedness...

3
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,071
Joseph Conrad, 1911.

4
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:57,978
Oh, my God.
How did it come to this?

5
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,400
How are you feeling,
sweetie?

6
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:39,903
I'm fine. My noggin is
still a bit throbbin'.

7
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:49,442
Shit.

8
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:26,376
Fuckin' nothin', I told you!

9
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:31,512
I'm sorry, Trixie. It wasn't
supposed to go down like this.

10
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:14,830
Aah! Fuckin' fuckers!
Out of here!

11
00:07:16,168 --> 00:07:18,227
Fuck off!

12
00:07:19,438 --> 00:07:21,872
Stay down, dick splash!

13
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:31,914
You gotta be
fucking kiddin'.

14
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,581
I trusted you, boom-boom,
and you betrayed me?

15
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,021
I'm sorry.

16
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,855
Oh, you're feeling sad,
are you, darling?

17
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:44,361
Well, fucking good,
you backstabbing ho!

18
00:07:44,463 --> 00:07:46,727
Enough with the sublime wit,
Gage.

19
00:07:46,832 --> 00:07:51,098
- You know why we're here.
- Who the fuck are you?

20
00:07:51,203 --> 00:07:54,730
Apart from one tasty little minge
I'd like to slam like a screen door?

21
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:58,401
- Where are they, Gage?
- Well, now, darling,

22
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:01,742
I'm not exactly sure as
to what you're referring.

23
00:08:01,847 --> 00:08:04,611
And even if I was,
I would have to ask you,

24
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:07,413
very politely, of course,
to yank on my dong.

25
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:12,620
- Have it your way.
- Oh, here we go.

26
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:16,758
You still pissed off
at me, Camero?

27
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:21,356
Obviously not.

28
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:24,800
Oh, yeah.
Oh, that's right.

29
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:28,738
Ooh. Oh. Ooh.

30
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:32,572
That's right. I knew you couldn't
resist Mr. Sticky much longer.

31
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:35,146
You said you like it rough.
That's right.

32
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:42,316
Where's the goods? Blow
me, you psycho rug muncher.

33
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:49,183
If I told you where they're buried,
you're just gonna fucking kill me anyway.

34
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:53,129
So why don't you and your
fucking fur pie jamboree...

35
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:57,362
just gather 'round
and slob my knob?

36
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:02,703
How about you
slob my knob, huh?

37
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:04,833
So they're buried.

38
00:09:06,545 --> 00:09:09,309
Okay.

39
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:14,481
Okay.

40
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:16,953
What the fuck
are you laughing at?

41
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,616
You.
I'm laughing at you.

42
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,818
Always with your nose
in other people's panties.

43
00:09:21,927 --> 00:09:24,020
I do what I want
when I want.

44
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,791
It's cunts like you
who'll always get used.

45
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:31,698
I told you never
to call me that.

46
00:09:33,405 --> 00:09:35,168
Let him go.
Please, let him go.

47
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:37,708
Fuck you, joyride!
You're the reason he's here.

48
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,481
What happened?

49
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:55,492
Open the trunk!

50
00:09:58,864 --> 00:10:02,527
Let's go.
What the fuck? Fucking...

51
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:08,331
What the fuck is wrong with you? How hard
can it be to administer a simple oral serum...

52
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,670
while sloshing some guy's
powder keg? What are you doing?

53
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,903
She's black hair,
blonde box, Hel,

54
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:15,845
and I'm gonna wail on tasty
like a dog with two dicks.

55
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:18,712
Enough. Get a hold of yourself.
You promised me she could handle it.

56
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:20,080
What happened?
I don't know.

57
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:22,677
I did everything you said.
It's not my fault.

58
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:25,552
The fuck it isn't!
Everything's destroyed.

59
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:27,353
We're never gonna find it now.

60
00:10:27,459 --> 00:10:30,257
35.34.8.81N...
What?

61
00:10:30,362 --> 00:10:33,024
Gage wrote it on a photograph... Some
kind of desert picture from space.

62
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,600
And what good
does that do us?

63
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:38,602
They may be vector coordinates.
You're sure about those numbers?

64
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:41,070
I'm positive. I have
a photojournalistic memory.

65
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:44,939
My mom used to say she wished I was
born a midget because... Let's go.

66
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:02,027
Tell us where to dig
and the lid comes up.

67
00:11:02,127 --> 00:11:04,027
It's as simple as that.

68
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,824
What's happening to him?

69
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:11,562
My heart.

70
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,160
Gage?
No, Trixie, stop!

71
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:21,437
Stupid fucking cow.
Thicker than a whale omelet.

72
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:25,039
Now, you get me out of here,
or I'll snap her neck.

73
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:27,050
Okay. Snap away. We don't give a shit.

74
00:11:27,152 --> 00:11:28,119
What?

75
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:33,180
Give me the keys and
the gun right fucking now.

76
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:34,919
Okay.

77
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,762
Don't hurt her.

78
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:42,857
Right. Now the gun.

79
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:54,439
You fucking whore.
You blew off my tea bag.

80
00:11:54,546 --> 00:11:57,276
That's two you owe me,
blow white.

81
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,317
- Oh, my God, you could have shot me!
- But I didn't.

82
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:01,943
You're crazy!
You're welcome.

83
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:05,820
Fun's over, Gage.
Next stop, Brown Town.

84
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:11,488
If I tell you, Pinky's gonna do
things to me you can't even imagine.

85
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:16,393
Pinky? What does Pinky
have to do with this?

86
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:19,232
Whose shit you think
you're dealing with?

87
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:21,135
You work for Pinky.

88
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,074
Oh, yeah. Not so
fucking clever now, are ya?

89
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:29,876
You stupid bitches. When Pinky finds
out about this, you're all fucking dead.

90
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,716
What's he talking about?
Who's Pinky?

91
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:43,091
If you help us, we'll not only let you live,
but we'll take you out of here to safety.

92
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:46,187
What? No, that was
never part of the deal.

93
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:54,172
I can't.

94
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:59,243
I was hoping you'd say that.

95
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:05,773
Just tell them, Gage.
Please, just tell them.

96
00:13:05,884 --> 00:13:08,682
All right, all right, all right.

97
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:10,948
Fucking shit.

98
00:13:14,526 --> 00:13:17,256
It's over there.

99
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:19,297
Fifteen paces due east
of the pickup.

100
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:25,260
Trixie, grab those shovels
by the trailer.

101
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:28,238
Camero, tie him up and gag
him. Put him back in the car.

102
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:31,867
- What? We're not actually going to...
- Who knows if he's lying?

103
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,604
And if trouble comes,
we need leverage.

104
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:36,078
- This is bullshit!
- Just do it.

105
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,975
Oh!

106
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:52,522
You take orders better
than a Bangkok bum boy.

107
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:54,656
Shut your fucking cake hole.

108
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:58,897
You might have a deal with her,
but you don't have one with me.

109
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:01,495
Who are they?

110
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:04,508
Puppets.
To get what I want.

111
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:08,136
How do you know
you can trust them?

112
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:11,648
Especially that one,
that fucking stripper.

113
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,617
She's dangerous.
You keep your eye on her.

114
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,020
Stop moving!
Hey!

115
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:24,562
Don't turn your back on this
fucking toerag! She'll betray ya!

116
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:27,427
Just like she did all the
others at the fucking Glory Hole!

117
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:30,362
What's he talking about?

118
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:32,130
Oh, they don't know,
do they?

119
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:37,808
You were at the Glory Hole?

120
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:41,710
Too fuckin' right she was! It was Camero
who'd have killed Liberty, and then...

121
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:51,022
So long, limp dick.

122
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:46,077
I love Home Depot.

123
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:49,841
Now listen here,
you fucking slag.

124
00:15:49,948 --> 00:15:52,712
I have a reputation
for being very persuasive.

125
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:55,912
And I know you're a virtuoso
with them throat muscles.

126
00:15:56,021 --> 00:16:01,425
So you better start spilling! Or I'm gonna
send Thaddeus here right up your chutney tube!

127
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:04,894
No!

128
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:07,693
No! No! No! No!

129
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:27,379
Are you out of your mind?
That wasn't part of the plan.

130
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,579
Maybe not part of your plan.

131
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:33,215
- You told me no one's gonna get hurt. You promised me.
- I know, Trixie. I know.

132
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,054
We couldn't have kept Gage
alive. He was dangerous.

133
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,994
No. I said right from the
start, we don't kill anybody.

134
00:16:39,097 --> 00:16:41,759
Now all we have is a corpse linked
to Pinky and nothing to show for it.

135
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:43,767
My God, they're gonna
lock us up forever.

136
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:46,895
- Shut up, ax wound.
- You shut up.

137
00:16:47,005 --> 00:16:48,836
- What'd you say?
- Back off, Camero.

138
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:51,774
No, why don't you let "Gland
Canyon" stick up for herself?

139
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:54,971
- What did Gage mean by "you'll betray us too?"
- He's fuckin' with your head.

140
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,411
Why didn't you tell me
you were at the Glory Hole?

141
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,176
Why didn't you tell me
you knew Gage?

142
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:01,775
- Because I didn't. He was lying.
- Exactly.

143
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:04,913
This is precisely what that
conniving cock block was trying to do.

144
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:08,857
Get us to turn on each other.
He's a master manipulator, Hel.

145
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:11,429
Besides, he told us
where the stash is.

146
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:15,660
Where we hope it is. He may have
simply been trying to buy time.

147
00:17:15,767 --> 00:17:17,860
He trusted me.

148
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:20,302
And now he's dead.

149
00:17:38,123 --> 00:17:41,115
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, that's good.

150
00:17:42,427 --> 00:17:44,486
That's it.
Show us your grabber.

151
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:46,496
You like that?

152
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:48,122
Yeah, Daddy likes.

153
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,895
Try this one on for size.

154
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,966
Fuckin' hell!

155
00:17:56,074 --> 00:17:58,338
I call that move
shock and awe.

156
00:17:58,443 --> 00:18:00,911
Oh, God.

157
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:04,005
I've never felt this way
about a gash before.

158
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:09,045
Oh! You are so sweet.

159
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:14,091
Oh, and you're decent
and pure, and I love you.

160
00:18:14,192 --> 00:18:16,524
Now why don't we
tie a knot, bump uglies...

161
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:18,721
and ride the pork bus
to Tuna City?

162
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:22,731
We'll drink to that.

163
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,337
Fuckin' hell.

164
00:18:31,843 --> 00:18:36,712
Hey. Hey. I need you to stay
strong and focused, Trixie.

165
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:39,579
Remember why we're here.
We all need this.

166
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:44,020
You the most.

167
00:18:44,122 --> 00:18:45,885
What's that?

168
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:48,459
Ring fucking ring.
Ring fucking ring.

169
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,586
- Ring fucking ring.
- It's coming from Gage.

170
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:56,225
Ring fucking ring. Ring
fucking ring. Ring fucking ring.

171
00:18:56,335 --> 00:19:00,635
Ring fucking ring.
Ring fucking ring.

172
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:04,470
Ring fucking ring.
Ring fucking ring.

173
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:07,602
- Ring fucking ring. Ring fucking ring.
- Los Angeles area code.

174
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:09,442
I thought I told you
to check his pockets.

175
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:11,948
What's the big deal?
Answer it.

176
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:16,282
The big deal? With the right
equipment, anyone can ping this phone.

177
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:18,652
If this is Pinky
or one of Gage's thugs,

178
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:21,590
they now know he
and even we are right here.

179
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:23,786
Oh, my goodness.
See?

180
00:19:23,895 --> 00:19:27,092
This is what happens when you don't
do as you're told. Ring fucking ring...

181
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:30,726
Fuck you, Hel. I did check him. There
was no phone on him when we left.

182
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,303
Well, obviously there was.

183
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:34,463
You calling me a liar?
I'm calling you reckless.

184
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:36,473
Stop it, both of you.

185
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:40,970
What are we gonna do now?
I know what I'm gonna do.

186
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:46,949
Fuckin' relax, Hel.
That call means nothing.

187
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:49,520
Just probably another one
of his slutty slop buckets...

188
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:51,646
looking to get worked
like a rented mule.

189
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:53,691
We can't take that chance.

190
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:56,955
We have to find what we came for
and get out of here, fast.

191
00:19:57,062 --> 00:20:00,657
Fine with me. The sooner we
blow this hellhole, the better.

192
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:07,298
But what about Gage?
Leave him for now.

193
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:09,397
We'll bury him
when we're done.

194
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:14,973
This was supposed to be easy.

195
00:20:28,059 --> 00:20:31,426
So, who is this Pinky person?

196
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:35,524
Guys?

197
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:38,626
Pinky's a notorious
underworld figure.

198
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:42,764
Runs drugs, weapons,
industrial contraband,

199
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:45,365
organizes hit squads,
counterfeit rings.

200
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:49,743
He's rumored to have government contracts
for wet work and supplying terror cells.

201
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:53,579
Nobody deals with Pinky directly, and
nobody even knows what he looks like.

202
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:55,243
Many believe Pinky is a phantom.

203
00:20:55,353 --> 00:21:00,188
Others think he sold his soul to
the devil. I think he is the devil.

204
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:03,420
Come on.
You're just messing with me.

205
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:05,257
Listen up, super ball.

206
00:21:05,363 --> 00:21:08,730
I've seen his victims
hanging from hooks,

207
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:10,734
cut open
like slaughtered lambs,

208
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:13,771
holding their guts in their
hands, pleading for death.

209
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:21,439
A few years ago, a Russian Oligarch
named Vladimir "The Butcher" Popmeov...

210
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:25,607
went after Pinky
with 50 of his best assassins.

211
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:31,451
Pinky blazed through that shit storm
armed only with a dusty old sword.

212
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:37,017
When it was over, the only thing left was
a 15-foot pile of dismembered bodies...

213
00:21:37,128 --> 00:21:40,461
and Popmeov's head piked up...

214
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:43,932
like the twinkly star
on a Christmas tree.

215
00:21:44,035 --> 00:21:47,732
There ain't a mac or a blow job on the
streets that ain't scared shitless of him.

216
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:50,399
Now this guy's after us?

217
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:54,345
Oh, crap.

218
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:06,119
Oh, my God, it feels so good!
Give it to me.

219
00:22:12,697 --> 00:22:14,961
Get off. Gotta go.

220
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:29,639
Where's the key, Black Ice?
Fuck you, busty. I don't have it.

221
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:46,696
Fuck you, bitch!
Give me back my pick.

222
00:23:04,215 --> 00:23:06,809
Hey, darlin', wanna go
for the ride of your life?

223
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:07,850
Huh?

224
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,370
What?

225
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:06,501
Nothing.

226
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:14,948
Oh, fuck.

227
00:24:20,058 --> 00:24:21,457
Gage.

228
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:29,198
Let's get him in the trunk.
Trixie, cover up any signs of blood.

229
00:24:30,702 --> 00:24:32,727
You got him?
Come on.

230
00:24:32,837 --> 00:24:34,566
Come on!

231
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:48,914
This is crazy. Let's just tell
the truth and end all this.

232
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:52,217
Don't say one fucking word. No
way I'm going back to the stocks.

233
00:24:52,323 --> 00:24:54,086
If I have to,
I'll take him out.

234
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:57,593
No. Both of you just shut up
and let me do the talking.

235
00:25:26,324 --> 00:25:29,782
Ladies,
everything okay here?

236
00:25:29,894 --> 00:25:32,624
Boy, are we glad to see you.

237
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:34,699
I, uh, saw the fence down
at the highway.

238
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,460
You aren't supposed
to be out here.

239
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:38,900
Government used to test nukes.

240
00:25:39,003 --> 00:25:41,665
Stay too long,
and you'll grow a third eye.

241
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:49,644
How, uh... How did you ladies
end up out here anyway?

242
00:25:51,282 --> 00:25:55,378
Well, Officer,
it's quite a story.

243
00:25:55,487 --> 00:26:00,288
See, my sisters and I are members
of the Sacred Girls Virgin Choir...

244
00:26:00,391 --> 00:26:02,291
out in Sand Dab,
Arizona.

245
00:26:02,393 --> 00:26:05,385
We were supposed to perform
a cantata today out in Mojave.

246
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:07,226
Since we were
so far from home,

247
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:11,928
the local parish director kindly
suggested that we stay as his guests.

248
00:26:12,036 --> 00:26:17,338
Well, after we were all snuggled
into our one little bed for the night,

249
00:26:17,442 --> 00:26:20,377
we heard loud music and
laughter coming from outside.

250
00:26:20,478 --> 00:26:23,504
We peeked our heads out only to
discover the entire congregation...

251
00:26:23,615 --> 00:26:29,520
dancing and-and laughing and smoking
something that may not have been tobacco.

252
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:31,851
They tried to fondle
our num-nums...

253
00:26:31,956 --> 00:26:35,255
and even convinced Bambi Lynn to
shoot Communion wafers out of her...

254
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,922
Anyway, we got out and ran to
our car, but they chased us.

255
00:26:40,031 --> 00:26:41,555
Well, thank the Lord
Cheyenne can drive...

256
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:43,998
and Bambi Lynn can gyrate
because we lost 'em!

257
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:49,165
By then, well, it was
3:00 a.m. and-and dark.

258
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,174
And we were scared.

259
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:54,507
And someone's not very good
with directions.

260
00:26:54,612 --> 00:26:57,479
And, well,
we ended up out here.

261
00:26:57,582 --> 00:27:02,952
And now, if you can
believe it, our car's dead.

262
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:11,585
I see.
We tried to jump her,

263
00:27:11,696 --> 00:27:15,427
but we just couldn't
get her off.

264
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:19,594
That's why we're
all dirty and desperate.

265
00:27:19,704 --> 00:27:24,403
You must think the worst
of us. No. Don't be silly.

266
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:26,477
I already
called the tow company,

267
00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:29,809
and they're
on their way, Deputy...

268
00:27:29,914 --> 00:27:31,882
Fucks.

269
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:37,754
Fuchs. It's, uh...
Fuchs, ma'am.

270
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:39,619
Oh.
Oops.

271
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,060
You know,
let me take a look at her.

272
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:46,392
Sometimes you just got to know
how to finger these old beauties.

273
00:27:46,497 --> 00:27:50,729
- That won't be necessary.
- Why not?

274
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:52,894
What happened to your hand?

275
00:27:57,575 --> 00:28:01,170
- Cut it on my crucifix.
- You know what?

276
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:05,807
The towing company already made us
post a $200 deposit for coming out here.

277
00:28:05,917 --> 00:28:07,908
Said they'd arrive by noon.

278
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:11,079
Maybe I can save you
that money. Hmm?

279
00:28:21,966 --> 00:28:25,527
Oh. Yeah, they don't make
'em like this anymore.

280
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:29,004
Nowadays, it's all
computers and sensors.

281
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:31,371
Got to work at NASA
just to change the oil.

282
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:48,855
All right, uh,
turn the key, please.

283
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:01,795
See? Nothing.

284
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:04,841
That's odd. It, uh,
must be the starter.

285
00:29:27,598 --> 00:29:30,533
You know what?

286
00:29:30,635 --> 00:29:34,002
Sometimes these old cars have
tool kits along with the jacks.

287
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,834
You can't!

288
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:39,007
You can't!

289
00:29:40,645 --> 00:29:43,273
Why not?
Be-Because...

290
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:45,542
Because the trunk lock
is rusted out.

291
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:48,244
Hasn't opened in years.

292
00:29:53,624 --> 00:29:57,060
- You okay, miss?
- She'll be fine.

293
00:29:57,161 --> 00:29:59,129
She's still upset
about last night.

294
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:01,198
Those choirboys
tried to defile her.

295
00:30:03,534 --> 00:30:07,061
Listen, you've been
so helpful and kind.

296
00:30:07,171 --> 00:30:09,605
The least I can do is come
back here and cook for you.

297
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:12,437
Say, dinner Friday?

298
00:30:12,543 --> 00:30:15,068
It's a...

299
00:30:17,081 --> 00:30:22,485
It's a tempting offer, but,
uh, I'll, uh, tell you what.

300
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:25,920
I'll-I'll swing back around later, make
sure, uh, you ladies got away safely.

301
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:30,324
Have a nice day, y'all.

302
00:30:48,713 --> 00:30:50,613
I bet you he's
calling us in right now.

303
00:30:50,715 --> 00:30:55,175
We should have told him.
He looked like a nice guy.

304
00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:57,618
He doesn't suspect a thing.

305
00:31:44,802 --> 00:31:47,032
Hey.

306
00:32:11,863 --> 00:32:14,195
Who wants into my pearly gates?

307
00:32:14,298 --> 00:32:18,257
Me! I do!
I'm a minister!

308
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:20,428
My God!

309
00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:22,870
Fuck off.

310
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:08,808
I'm Trixie,
your little slice of heaven.

311
00:33:11,822 --> 00:33:13,722
I am in love.

312
00:33:13,824 --> 00:33:15,815
Good girl.

313
00:33:46,557 --> 00:33:50,118
- You know, I've been thinking.
- Christ.

314
00:33:50,228 --> 00:33:53,664
Is stealing from a criminal any
better than just being a criminal?

315
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,325
I've got a better one
for you, princess.

316
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:01,633
What's the most outrageous place
you've ever been key-holed?

317
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:05,675
- Why do you wanna know?
- Just curious.

318
00:34:05,776 --> 00:34:08,336
It says
a lot about a woman.

319
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:13,383
Hmm. Either a bumper car three-way
at the Redlands County Fair...

320
00:34:13,484 --> 00:34:17,978
or on top of a horse-drawn buggy in
Amish Country with Jakey Stalfoos.

321
00:34:18,089 --> 00:34:19,522
Hel?

322
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:23,957
Let's have a little less chitchat
and a lot more digging, huh?

323
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:28,622
I'm gonna grind those secrets
out of you one day, Hel.

324
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,166
I don't have any secrets.

325
00:34:33,504 --> 00:34:35,699
Well,
what about you, Camero?

326
00:34:35,806 --> 00:34:39,105
My best bang
was a contortionist...

327
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:42,737
out behind the freak show tent
at Circus Nudieus.

328
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:47,216
I couldn't stand straight for
days. Never did get her name.

329
00:35:23,387 --> 00:35:24,786
Evening, Hot Wire.

330
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:34,458
Haven't seen your ugly mug
since the Glory Hole.

331
00:35:34,565 --> 00:35:36,931
Camero, I was...
I was just following orders.

332
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:42,301
No hard... Smurf! Shit!
Skittle! Piss... feelings, huh?

333
00:35:42,406 --> 00:35:43,896
Where's Gage?

334
00:35:46,277 --> 00:35:49,269
I don't know.

335
00:35:52,516 --> 00:35:54,643
I don't have time to
be dry-fucked tonight.

336
00:36:27,451 --> 00:36:30,011
Honey, I'm undefeated here.

337
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:34,490
All right, all right. Gage put together
another Bombshell Bitchfest Blowout.

338
00:36:34,592 --> 00:36:36,492
Friday, midnight.

339
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:03,917
It just keeps getting
hotter and hotter.

340
00:37:04,021 --> 00:37:06,012
I can't take this anymore.

341
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:25,001
Hey, don't waste all the...

342
00:37:26,343 --> 00:37:29,835
Grab my nuts
and call me Sally.

343
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:32,814
Uh, you might wanna cover up.

344
00:37:34,685 --> 00:37:36,880
What?

345
00:37:36,987 --> 00:37:39,353
Don't tell me you don't want
some of what I'm selling.

346
00:37:41,325 --> 00:37:43,885
I'm gonna get you wet.

347
00:37:43,994 --> 00:37:47,054
Okay, quit messing around,
Trixie. I mean it.

348
00:37:48,632 --> 00:37:50,224
You fuckin' bitch.

349
00:38:00,244 --> 00:38:02,337
Hey.

350
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:15,355
Don't even think about it.

351
00:38:18,562 --> 00:38:23,022
You two fucking bitches
are dead.

352
00:39:16,987 --> 00:39:19,285
Did the verbals
from sat-comm concur?

353
00:39:30,467 --> 00:39:33,027
Gage must have
a sick sense of humor.

354
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:35,002
And a death wish.

355
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,040
Does the girl suspect
anything? No, Phoenix.

356
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:41,873
Everything is proceeding as
planned. Mobilize the ops.

357
00:39:41,979 --> 00:39:43,879
We move in five days' time.

358
00:39:43,981 --> 00:39:46,609
The nano-swarm is active, and
the casualties will be immense.

359
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,311
Time to move.
They've traced us.

360
00:40:02,866 --> 00:40:05,357
Ow.

361
00:40:05,469 --> 00:40:08,905
- Are you okay?
- Something's poking my heinie.

362
00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:12,568
What's that?

363
00:40:15,512 --> 00:40:17,412
Help me dig.

364
00:40:27,157 --> 00:40:29,523
I think this is it.

365
00:40:29,627 --> 00:40:32,255
Hooray for us. We rock!

366
00:40:37,301 --> 00:40:38,928
- Oh!
- Oh, my God.

367
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:46,735
Looks like he hasn't been
out here that long.

368
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:49,369
Maybe a few weeks.

369
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:53,917
No one I know. Poor
bastard. Didn't die quickly.

370
00:40:55,452 --> 00:40:57,852
Someone was trying to
work something out of him.

371
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:59,081
Gage?

372
00:40:59,189 --> 00:41:01,089
No.

373
00:41:01,191 --> 00:41:04,160
He was dark, not this dark.

374
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:06,593
There's only one person that
would do this kind of thing.

375
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:24,045
Are we being watched?

376
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:26,275
This is crazy!
I've had enough!

377
00:41:26,383 --> 00:41:28,851
I wanna go home!
Calm down, Trix.

378
00:41:28,952 --> 00:41:32,911
Calm down? That's all you keep
telling me, Hel, but people keep dying!

379
00:41:33,023 --> 00:41:35,253
I can't end up like him!

380
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:43,231
- We're running out of time.
- Your friend's losing it.

381
00:41:43,333 --> 00:41:45,801
- She'll be fine.
- I'm not going down because of her.

382
00:41:45,903 --> 00:41:49,498
I said she'll be fine.
Check the perimeter.

383
00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:05,946
I'm sorry, Hel. I
thought I could do this.

384
00:42:07,257 --> 00:42:09,657
I thought
I could be strong.

385
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,888
No, Trix.
I let you down.

386
00:42:14,598 --> 00:42:16,566
I never should have
asked you to do this.

387
00:42:19,369 --> 00:42:21,837
You didn't force me.

388
00:42:21,939 --> 00:42:26,103
I wanted to be here...
with you.

389
00:42:35,953 --> 00:42:40,754
You're the first person in my whole
life who's ever really believed in me.

390
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:53,136
We shouldn't.

391
00:42:54,438 --> 00:42:56,338
Not here.

392
00:42:57,941 --> 00:43:00,273
Please.

393
00:43:00,377 --> 00:43:02,277
I need you.

394
00:43:03,947 --> 00:43:06,745
I've never felt
this way before.

395
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:08,841
About anyone.

396
00:43:10,788 --> 00:43:12,688
Then why don't you
kiss me?

397
00:43:16,527 --> 00:43:18,427
Now.

398
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:46,915
Mommy, Mommy!

399
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:49,645
Hi, honey.

400
00:44:49,753 --> 00:44:52,051
What happened?
Did you drop your snow cone?

401
00:44:52,155 --> 00:44:56,114
It tastes like salty balls.
Oh, no.

402
00:44:56,226 --> 00:45:00,322
Well, we can get you
another one, can't we, Helen?

403
00:45:02,699 --> 00:45:05,259
It will surely be done,
Princess Lily.

404
00:45:06,637 --> 00:45:09,435
You see? You go that
way. We'll be right there.

405
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:14,203
Is everything okay?

406
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,111
Yeah.

407
00:45:19,416 --> 00:45:21,316
Everything is perfect
when I'm with you.

408
00:45:21,418 --> 00:45:24,945
Well, then turn that frown
upside down, girlfriend.

409
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:28,781
There's something
I'd like you to do for me.

410
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:30,792
But I'm having a hard time
justifying it.

411
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:32,361
Why?

412
00:45:32,462 --> 00:45:33,952
It's dangerous.

413
00:45:38,835 --> 00:45:44,699
After everything you've done for
me, Hel, I'd do anything for you.

414
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:25,133
What the fuck?

415
00:47:27,577 --> 00:47:30,341
Camero.
I can explain.

416
00:47:30,447 --> 00:47:35,282
I'm out there sweating my ass off,
and you're in here bashing gash?

417
00:47:36,453 --> 00:47:38,648
And Gage was right.
I can't trust you.

418
00:47:38,755 --> 00:47:41,155
- Yes, you can.
- Bullshit!

419
00:47:41,258 --> 00:47:42,885
What else
aren't you telling me?

420
00:47:42,993 --> 00:47:45,791
- You planning on cutting me out of the score as well?
- Don't be ridiculous.

421
00:47:45,896 --> 00:47:47,659
Who's being fucking
ridiculous, Hel?

422
00:47:47,764 --> 00:47:50,927
It's my fault, Camero.
I asked Hel not to tell you.

423
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:54,026
I knew you'd fly off the handle
and become even more uncontrollable.

424
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:57,537
So I need to be controlled.

425
00:47:57,641 --> 00:48:00,940
- Is that what you think? Is it?
- No.

426
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:04,343
Because I'm not the one here
plumbing the depths of cooterlicious,

427
00:48:04,448 --> 00:48:07,212
pretending to be
something I'm not.

428
00:48:07,317 --> 00:48:11,617
I knew you were trouble. I never
should have let Hel bring you in.

429
00:48:11,721 --> 00:48:15,020
We wouldn't have found this
place without her, remember? True.

430
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:16,524
So now we can waste her.

431
00:48:18,695 --> 00:48:20,663
Kill her and you'll
have to kill me too.

432
00:48:20,764 --> 00:48:24,757
And then you won't have anyone to
fence the goods or work the contacts.

433
00:48:24,868 --> 00:48:26,392
Is that what you want?

434
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:29,703
I'm sorry, Camero.

435
00:48:29,806 --> 00:48:33,503
I should have told you about
us right from the start,

436
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:37,046
but I never thought about
betraying you on this deal.

437
00:48:37,147 --> 00:48:39,911
We're all in this
to the end.

438
00:48:40,016 --> 00:48:43,816
Either we all win
or we all lose,

439
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,480
and losing now
has way too high a price.

440
00:49:00,537 --> 00:49:03,233
Lie again
and you're both dead.

441
00:49:28,265 --> 00:49:30,199
Oh, I'm sorry.

442
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:34,066
That was my fault.
I couldn't control myself.

443
00:49:34,171 --> 00:49:36,833
Don't ever apologize
for being you.

444
00:49:38,208 --> 00:49:40,642
You know,
she scares me, Hel.

445
00:49:40,744 --> 00:49:42,871
Are you sure she's
not gonna try something?

446
00:49:42,979 --> 00:49:45,914
With Camero, there's no sure
things. Help me up, will you?

447
00:49:57,894 --> 00:49:59,987
Whoa.

448
00:50:01,097 --> 00:50:03,292
Looks like Gage
was ready for war.

449
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,960
Camero, get in here!
We found something!

450
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:12,107
K-14 Corsair rail gun...

451
00:50:12,209 --> 00:50:14,074
Carbon fiber mounts,

452
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:18,978
Hellfire dampening system
and Zion laser scope.

453
00:50:19,082 --> 00:50:24,452
This is some serious
and classified hardware.

454
00:50:25,755 --> 00:50:27,655
How do you know all that?

455
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:33,459
My father was a part of the C.I.A.'s
Ghost Recon Group in the '80s.

456
00:50:33,563 --> 00:50:35,827
Oh.

457
00:50:35,932 --> 00:50:37,661
Camero, you hear me?

458
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:51,180
W-Where did she go?

459
00:50:52,482 --> 00:50:54,746
Camero?

460
00:50:54,851 --> 00:50:56,751
Where are you?

461
00:51:08,632 --> 00:51:10,793
Trixie, get inside,
quick.

462
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:13,801
What up, bitches?
Hi, hi!

463
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:30,583
You ain't kidding, Kinki. It's the
Poontang Valley Express around here.

464
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:31,654
Hmm.

465
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:33,655
Who the hell are you?

466
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:35,657
Think of us as, uh,

467
00:51:39,329 --> 00:51:42,856
debt collectors,
Pussybone Parfait!

468
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:25,274
Oh.

469
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:41,714
Uh-oh, naughty girl.

470
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:43,918
Kinki spanking.

471
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:48,927
Take it easy. Take it easy. You're okay.

472
00:52:56,272 --> 00:52:59,139
Looks like we got you
by the balls this time, Camero.

473
00:53:00,910 --> 00:53:02,434
You know these two?

474
00:53:02,545 --> 00:53:06,948
Oh, when she came looking for Gage,
I figured something big was up.

475
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:09,484
Love me long time, jeeter!

476
00:53:09,586 --> 00:53:11,816
We've been tracking you.

477
00:53:11,921 --> 00:53:13,821
So...

478
00:53:15,625 --> 00:53:17,525
the legendary
Gage treasure is true.

479
00:53:18,895 --> 00:53:21,864
- Where is it at?
- We don't know.

480
00:53:21,965 --> 00:53:24,092
Look, don't dry fuck me. I won't
think twice about having Kinki...

481
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,134
shit me a loud
purple twinkie...

482
00:53:26,236 --> 00:53:27,931
your pretty little faces.

483
00:53:28,037 --> 00:53:31,871
Gage lied to us. It's
not buried where he said.

484
00:53:31,975 --> 00:53:34,341
Oh.

485
00:53:34,444 --> 00:53:36,344
Well, then you better
keep digging.

486
00:53:36,446 --> 00:53:40,280
Fuck that. I ain't shoveling
anything for you but your grave.

487
00:53:42,152 --> 00:53:46,020
Enough! We'll dig.
Just leave her alone.

488
00:53:49,993 --> 00:53:54,020
I'm gonna enjoy beating seven
shades of shit out of both of you!

489
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:06,234
Still... Bunghole Barney
Bungalow... same old Camero.

490
00:54:07,977 --> 00:54:10,878
Now start fucking digging.

491
00:54:15,084 --> 00:54:16,676
I want to play with the...

492
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:19,847
Not you, cherry pie.

493
00:54:19,956 --> 00:54:22,288
You stay here.

494
00:54:26,129 --> 00:54:28,029
Do as he says.

495
00:54:36,873 --> 00:54:39,774
You see, Kinki likes you.

496
00:54:41,177 --> 00:54:44,704
Kinki wants to play.

497
00:54:51,221 --> 00:54:53,587
What does she
wanna play?

498
00:55:13,576 --> 00:55:16,977
Yeah. Ooh.

499
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:22,474
I need help gettin' off.

500
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:26,713
I'm going to miss you, Camero.

501
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:29,257
You certainly have
livened up my incarceration.

502
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:32,817
Inmate 1138. You're
ready for processing.

503
00:55:32,929 --> 00:55:34,794
All clear.

504
00:55:34,898 --> 00:55:37,799
- Evac Cell 2187.
- But...

505
00:55:37,901 --> 00:55:41,667
I told you.
I can still get you out.

506
00:55:41,771 --> 00:55:45,070
But you have to give me
something to work with.

507
00:55:45,174 --> 00:55:49,611
Stick your finger
in her ass, Camero.

508
00:55:49,712 --> 00:55:51,509
All right, let's go.

509
00:55:59,489 --> 00:56:01,480
Can I trust you?

510
00:56:01,591 --> 00:56:03,491
Of course.

511
00:56:03,593 --> 00:56:07,029
Get me out of here, and I'll split
200 million in diamonds with you.

512
00:56:18,374 --> 00:56:21,002
Giddyup!
Giddyup!

513
00:56:21,110 --> 00:56:24,102
Come on! Go faster!
You're my horse.

514
00:56:24,213 --> 00:56:25,942
Come on. Let's go.
Faster.

515
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:29,212
- Whoo!
- Yee-ha!

516
00:56:29,319 --> 00:56:31,287
Ride her, Kinki! Whoo!

517
00:56:31,387 --> 00:56:33,548
Giddyup. Show your mama.
Come on. Let's go. Faster.

518
00:56:33,656 --> 00:56:35,385
- Hey.
- Huh?

519
00:56:41,631 --> 00:56:45,123
It's a private show!
Back to work!

520
00:56:48,137 --> 00:56:50,332
Let's go! Come on!
Yah!

521
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:53,204
If I make a diversionary
run for the guns,

522
00:56:53,309 --> 00:56:56,836
you think you can get
close enough to Trixie?

523
00:56:59,248 --> 00:57:01,148
Huh?

524
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:04,981
Oh, what, are you not
talking to me now?

525
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:09,047
Come on, Camero. I need you.
To save Miss Magic Mouth?

526
00:57:09,158 --> 00:57:11,092
No way.

527
00:57:11,194 --> 00:57:13,424
Are you on something?

528
00:57:13,529 --> 00:57:15,622
I don't even know
who you are anymore.

529
00:57:15,732 --> 00:57:17,700
I should've
never trusted you,

530
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:20,166
certainly never
fallen in love.

531
00:57:22,438 --> 00:57:25,100
Get 'em, girl! Get 'em, girl!

532
00:57:25,208 --> 00:57:28,006
Whoo! Whoo!

533
00:57:37,153 --> 00:57:39,246
That's it.

534
00:57:39,355 --> 00:57:42,415
Get up.

535
00:57:42,525 --> 00:57:46,222
Get up.
No.

536
00:57:46,329 --> 00:57:50,197
No! No! No!
Stop! No! No! No!

537
00:57:50,299 --> 00:57:52,324
Forget about her.

538
00:57:52,435 --> 00:57:56,599
We can pull this off.
It's about you and me now.

539
00:57:56,706 --> 00:57:59,470
No! No! Stop it!
Help! Help me!

540
00:57:59,575 --> 00:58:02,601
Stop! No! No!

541
00:58:02,712 --> 00:58:05,408
Hey, we've
found something!

542
00:58:06,382 --> 00:58:09,249
Gorgonzola orgy!

543
00:58:09,352 --> 00:58:13,550
Come on, flat ass.

544
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:20,154
Clear it.

545
00:58:20,263 --> 00:58:21,491
You clear it.

546
00:58:31,374 --> 00:58:33,467
Open it.
I said open it.

547
00:58:33,576 --> 00:58:35,510
On your knees,
balloon boobs.

548
00:58:35,611 --> 00:58:37,511
It's the only place you've
ever been good at anyway.

549
00:58:44,587 --> 00:58:46,817
Open it!

550
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:56,859
Maybe there's
some kind of code.

551
00:58:56,966 --> 00:59:01,426
Well, who knows the... P-P-Plumps
when you cook it... code?

552
00:59:02,538 --> 00:59:04,130
Who knows it?

553
00:59:05,808 --> 00:59:08,038
No one?

554
00:59:12,381 --> 00:59:15,817
Kinki's right. No one spills,
no reason to keep you alive.

555
00:59:15,918 --> 00:59:18,887
Wait! Let me try.

556
00:59:21,524 --> 00:59:23,253
Let me try.
Hurry up!

557
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:25,122
Okay.
Hurry it up!

558
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:26,286
Okay.
Hurry up!

559
00:59:40,977 --> 00:59:44,344
Whoo-ee!

560
00:59:44,647 --> 00:59:48,208
Thank you, Happy Sacks.
We'll take it from here.

561
00:59:48,317 --> 00:59:49,807
Kinki, kill 'em.
Okay.

562
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:51,648
Hold it!

563
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:54,917
I knew something
was going on here.

564
00:59:55,024 --> 00:59:57,356
Drop it!

565
00:59:57,460 --> 01:00:00,224
Uh, everybody
on the ground. Go!

566
01:00:00,329 --> 01:00:03,890
Drop it, I said.
Come on. Drop it.

567
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,491
All right, this is the last
time I'm gonna tell you.

568
01:00:06,602 --> 01:00:09,332
Drop the weapon
and get on the ground!

569
01:00:26,489 --> 01:00:28,389
Okay, let's go.

570
01:00:28,491 --> 01:00:30,459
Let's go. Come on.

571
01:00:32,028 --> 01:00:34,428
- Oh, no.
- Get away!

572
01:00:34,530 --> 01:00:37,431
Somebody has
a problem here.

573
01:00:37,533 --> 01:00:40,093
- Get away.
- Here I come.

574
01:01:31,621 --> 01:01:35,148
Oh, shit!

575
01:02:02,919 --> 01:02:04,682
No!

576
01:02:04,787 --> 01:02:07,221
Fortune cookie say,
"Future not so bright."

577
01:02:12,929 --> 01:02:14,726
- Who...
- Stop!

578
01:02:14,830 --> 01:02:16,161
Are you?

579
01:02:16,265 --> 01:02:19,666
Camero, stop!

580
01:02:19,769 --> 01:02:22,966
Stop it, Camero! No!
That's it, Pop Tart.

581
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:26,667
I'm gonna dog-pound you
straight to China.

582
01:02:31,981 --> 01:02:34,711
That's enough,
God-fucking-damn it!

583
01:02:36,619 --> 01:02:39,383
I've had enough of this bullshit!
It's gonna end right fucking now!

584
01:02:39,488 --> 01:02:42,855
- Starting to lose our cool, are we?
- We tie him up in the trailer.

585
01:02:42,959 --> 01:02:45,052
Let's gank this fucker right
now. No matter who he is,

586
01:02:45,161 --> 01:02:47,356
he won't nipple-lick us
if he's sucking daisy roots.

587
01:02:47,463 --> 01:02:49,931
No more killing today,
period.

588
01:02:50,032 --> 01:02:54,230
If you were up for seven to 10, Hel,
how did you fly in under three weeks?

589
01:02:54,337 --> 01:02:57,329
And how the fuck did you spring me
with 12 years left on my sentence?

590
01:02:59,875 --> 01:03:03,743
Well, this is America. She-She's sexy and
loaded and has high-powered connections.

591
01:03:03,846 --> 01:03:07,338
- Bullshit.
- I just saved your ass, again.

592
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:09,543
The fuck you did!
I had it under control.

593
01:03:09,652 --> 01:03:11,620
You're becoming
a liability, Camero,

594
01:03:11,721 --> 01:03:14,212
not to mention a martyr
to selective amnesia.

595
01:03:14,323 --> 01:03:17,349
You're so hopped up on whatever shit
you're dropping, you're irrational.

596
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:21,954
Fuck you! I'm finally starting
to see you for who you really are.

597
01:03:23,332 --> 01:03:25,630
What is she
talking about?

598
01:03:25,735 --> 01:03:29,330
The prison,
the weapons, the cash.

599
01:03:29,438 --> 01:03:32,771
Your mastery
of Honduran snuff sex.

600
01:03:32,875 --> 01:03:37,539
You wanna tell Good & Plenty what
you punched in, or should I, Hel, huh?

601
01:03:37,646 --> 01:03:42,106
7-5-6-5-0.
What does that spell?

602
01:03:44,687 --> 01:03:47,281
Oh, my God!
Why did you do that?

603
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:50,391
I had no choice, Trixie.

604
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:53,121
She's clearly delusional
and off the rails.

605
01:03:53,229 --> 01:03:55,163
Grab his cuffs
and secure him inside.

606
01:03:55,264 --> 01:03:57,789
What are you gonna do?

607
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:01,136
What needs to be done.

608
01:04:20,589 --> 01:04:22,682
I'm sorry.

609
01:04:22,792 --> 01:04:25,920
Thank you, Trixie.

610
01:04:30,466 --> 01:04:33,697
How do you know my name? Uh...

611
01:04:35,404 --> 01:04:38,100
Who are you?

612
01:04:38,207 --> 01:04:40,767
I'm a big fan.

613
01:04:41,977 --> 01:04:44,309
A what?

614
01:04:45,815 --> 01:04:49,581
Uh... An aficionado
of your ass-ets.

615
01:04:49,685 --> 01:04:52,518
Uh, I've seen you at Papa
Piccolo's Naughty Knickers Round-up.

616
01:04:52,621 --> 01:04:55,886
You're astonishing and...

617
01:04:55,991 --> 01:04:58,357
gorgeous.

618
01:05:00,663 --> 01:05:04,531
When I-I came by earlier,
I... I knew it was you.

619
01:05:04,633 --> 01:05:07,466
And I-I could tell something was
wrong, and I was worried about you.

620
01:05:10,306 --> 01:05:13,742
Oh, God...

621
01:05:13,843 --> 01:05:18,246
I'm sorry. You must think I'm
some kind of crazy stalker.

622
01:05:18,347 --> 01:05:21,339
You were worried
about me?

623
01:05:23,285 --> 01:05:25,810
What's your name?

624
01:05:25,921 --> 01:05:28,048
Roy.

625
01:05:30,826 --> 01:05:33,920
Deputy Roy Eugene Fuchs, ma'am.

626
01:05:35,030 --> 01:05:37,362
That's a nice name.

627
01:05:43,005 --> 01:05:45,064
What are you mixed up in?

628
01:05:45,174 --> 01:05:47,369
Who are those women?

629
01:05:47,476 --> 01:05:49,910
I don't even think
I know anymore.

630
01:05:50,012 --> 01:05:53,209
Let me help you, Trixie.

631
01:06:01,157 --> 01:06:03,057
Come on.

632
01:06:13,169 --> 01:06:15,865
Hey, I'll be back.

633
01:06:15,971 --> 01:06:18,735
It's not too late to make
the right decision, Trixie.

634
01:06:18,841 --> 01:06:23,437
Either way,
I'm here for you.

635
01:06:59,081 --> 01:07:01,072
Where's Camero?

636
01:07:06,255 --> 01:07:08,246
You chained her up?

637
01:07:08,357 --> 01:07:12,157
She's all right.
Come on.

638
01:07:12,261 --> 01:07:14,627
I'm scared, Hel.
What's going on?

639
01:07:14,730 --> 01:07:17,221
You're just gonna have
to trust me on this, Trixie.

640
01:07:17,333 --> 01:07:19,301
Now, let's go.

641
01:07:20,736 --> 01:07:24,263
I'm sorry.

642
01:07:24,373 --> 01:07:27,467
You better pray to whatever God you
worship I don't get out of this thing.

643
01:07:43,459 --> 01:07:45,654
What is it that
troubles you, Sister?

644
01:07:45,761 --> 01:07:47,695
You have to help me,
Mother Superior.

645
01:07:47,796 --> 01:07:51,926
My impure thoughts have gone
beyond inanimate objects...

646
01:07:52,034 --> 01:07:57,336
and devolved into lusting after
strapping Latvian gymnasts. No!

647
01:08:03,445 --> 01:08:05,538
Oh, Sister Sara.

648
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:09,911
- Ah.
- Oh!

649
01:08:10,019 --> 01:08:14,217
- Oh. Uh...
- God-fucking-damn it.

650
01:08:14,323 --> 01:08:16,883
Sister Prudence
Bangtail.

651
01:08:16,992 --> 01:08:19,085
Well, this is
the last straw.

652
01:08:19,194 --> 01:08:21,287
Save it, crusty.
I'm vapor.

653
01:08:21,397 --> 01:08:24,059
This place bites anyway.

654
01:08:32,941 --> 01:08:35,341
Ooh!

655
01:08:39,615 --> 01:08:42,175
May God have mercy
on your soul.

656
01:08:53,128 --> 01:08:55,028
Freeze, Sister!

657
01:08:56,865 --> 01:08:59,834
Put your hands in the air.
Do it now.

658
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:09,471
Well, well, well.

659
01:09:09,578 --> 01:09:12,411
Hiding out
in a convent?

660
01:09:12,514 --> 01:09:16,245
Impersonating a nun? Juggling
pussy in a pornographic circus?

661
01:09:16,352 --> 01:09:20,550
Oh, that is tasteless,
even for you, Camero.

662
01:09:27,229 --> 01:09:29,129
Ah.

663
01:09:32,868 --> 01:09:35,063
Right-o, lads,

664
01:09:35,170 --> 01:09:38,469
don't be afraid to use
excessive force on this one.

665
01:09:47,950 --> 01:09:50,009
I can't see
a thing.

666
01:09:51,253 --> 01:09:53,153
Move back.

667
01:10:24,753 --> 01:10:27,654
What is all this?

668
01:10:27,756 --> 01:10:31,624
It's everything Gage
stole from Pinky. Huh?

669
01:10:31,727 --> 01:10:36,096
That crafty fucker's been
funneling Pinky's goods for years.

670
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:39,167
That's why
he stashed out here...

671
01:10:39,268 --> 01:10:42,669
so he could secretly distribute the
goods each time a buyer was secured.

672
01:10:42,771 --> 01:10:45,239
How do you know
all this?

673
01:10:46,942 --> 01:10:50,969
If you lay with criminals...
Be careful.

674
01:10:51,079 --> 01:10:54,845
There will be
dangerous shit down here.

675
01:11:44,967 --> 01:11:47,731
Hey, Hel, look at this.

676
01:11:47,836 --> 01:11:51,772
It's beautiful.
Can I keep it?

677
01:11:51,874 --> 01:11:54,604
Sure. Keep it.

678
01:12:11,527 --> 01:12:14,052
I found them.

679
01:12:20,235 --> 01:12:23,966
Oh, my!

680
01:12:24,072 --> 01:12:26,131
Flawless,

681
01:12:26,241 --> 01:12:28,266
uncoded...

682
01:12:28,377 --> 01:12:30,345
and all ours.

683
01:12:33,882 --> 01:12:35,850
Well, what now?

684
01:12:39,354 --> 01:12:41,254
Time to disappear.

685
01:12:54,269 --> 01:12:56,100
Shit.

686
01:12:56,204 --> 01:12:59,435
What do we do? What do we do? Just
get to the car and start it up.

687
01:12:59,541 --> 01:13:01,509
But we can't leave Roy. Go!

688
01:13:01,610 --> 01:13:04,477
But... But...
Just... Just go to the car!

689
01:13:15,757 --> 01:13:17,622
Time to get medieval.

690
01:13:19,061 --> 01:13:21,655
Camero, ease up.

691
01:13:21,763 --> 01:13:25,563
We have the diamonds.
Okay? The plan worked.

692
01:13:25,667 --> 01:13:28,659
- All we have to do is drive away, and we've won.
- Bullshit.

693
01:13:28,770 --> 01:13:30,897
I trusted you before.
Look where that got me.

694
01:13:31,006 --> 01:13:34,305
Goddamn it, Camero! I'm not
gonna let you fuck this up now!

695
01:13:34,409 --> 01:13:36,309
Drop that chain and get
your head on straight.

696
01:13:36,411 --> 01:13:39,539
Time to test your loyalty and
see what you're really made of.

697
01:13:39,648 --> 01:13:44,711
A wet-job, Polly punanni, and
all is forgiven, whoever you are.

698
01:13:45,687 --> 01:13:49,020
Come on.
You and me started this.

699
01:13:49,124 --> 01:13:51,422
You and me should finish it.
No.

700
01:13:51,526 --> 01:13:53,926
- We're in this together.
- Fine.

701
01:13:54,029 --> 01:13:57,226
Then I'm gonna sleigh-ride
your sorry ass once and for all.

702
01:14:03,805 --> 01:14:05,602
If you want me,

703
01:14:06,875 --> 01:14:08,775
come and get me.

704
01:14:14,483 --> 01:14:17,418
Come on, guys. Don't.
Please don't.

705
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:53,788
Come on, guys. Stop!

706
01:15:17,579 --> 01:15:19,672
I said stop!

707
01:16:10,398 --> 01:16:13,333
Stop!
Camero, stop it!

708
01:16:13,435 --> 01:16:15,130
You're next,
Pantyraid.

709
01:16:32,354 --> 01:16:34,686
Stay down, Camero.
I don't wanna have to kill you.

710
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:52,001
How do you like it, bitch?

711
01:16:52,107 --> 01:16:54,575
Did you really think
you could beat me, huh?

712
01:17:14,396 --> 01:17:16,728
Get this fucking going!

713
01:17:31,046 --> 01:17:33,276
Trixie. Trixie!

714
01:17:57,939 --> 01:18:00,499
Trixie!

715
01:18:05,847 --> 01:18:07,940
Fire in your hole.

716
01:18:36,578 --> 01:18:39,376
So long, bitches.

717
01:18:44,953 --> 01:18:48,514
Ram this in your clambake,
bitch cake.

718
01:19:06,808 --> 01:19:09,743
Roy! Roy!

719
01:20:01,963 --> 01:20:04,932
Go ahead and kill me.

720
01:20:05,033 --> 01:20:06,933
I don't care anymore.

721
01:20:10,705 --> 01:20:14,163
It's all a lie,
isn't it?

722
01:20:21,549 --> 01:20:23,016
Yes.

723
01:20:24,185 --> 01:20:26,619
Why?

724
01:20:26,721 --> 01:20:28,780
Who are you?

725
01:20:30,725 --> 01:20:32,955
Are you...
No.

726
01:20:34,829 --> 01:20:36,797
I'm not Pinky.

727
01:20:38,767 --> 01:20:40,667
I'm...

728
01:20:56,885 --> 01:20:58,477
Give me the specs,
Deiter.

729
01:21:09,297 --> 01:21:12,755
The specs! Now!

730
01:21:12,867 --> 01:21:14,835
You've got
the wrong berman.

731
01:21:14,936 --> 01:21:17,928
I know nothing of this
murderous plague you speak of.

732
01:21:18,039 --> 01:21:20,098
Wrong answer, Deiter.

733
01:21:31,786 --> 01:21:34,448
Congratulations,
Foxy 69.

734
01:21:34,556 --> 01:21:37,491
Mission accomplished, Phoenix.
I have the antitoxin data.

735
01:21:37,592 --> 01:21:40,823
I have another assignment that
demands your immediate attention.

736
01:21:40,929 --> 01:21:44,797
As you know, the Glory Hole was
a regrettable miscalculation.

737
01:21:44,899 --> 01:21:47,732
But tac-comm has learned of another
opportunity to retrieve the nano-swarm.

738
01:21:51,239 --> 01:21:53,707
I'm sending you to Honey
Junction Women's Prison...

739
01:21:53,808 --> 01:21:56,470
to infiltrate and make contact with
a former colleague of Mortimer Gage.

740
01:21:56,578 --> 01:21:58,546
She goes by an alias,
Camero.

741
01:21:58,646 --> 01:22:00,671
I'm on it.

742
01:22:00,782 --> 01:22:04,582
Good. Now, bury all evidence
and get yourself home.

743
01:22:04,686 --> 01:22:07,018
Phoenix out.

744
01:22:27,408 --> 01:22:29,376
Oh, my God.

745
01:22:30,678 --> 01:22:32,839
You're a wicked-cool
covert operative...

746
01:22:32,947 --> 01:22:35,814
masquerading
as a sex-toy tycoon?

747
01:22:37,018 --> 01:22:38,576
Mm-hmm.

748
01:22:40,522 --> 01:22:43,514
My mission
was to reclaim that...

749
01:22:43,625 --> 01:22:45,559
a weaponized vial
of synthetic nano-swarm...

750
01:22:45,660 --> 01:22:48,390
that Gage hijacked
from a C.I.A. convoy.

751
01:22:48,496 --> 01:22:51,590
It's filled with trillions of
self-replicating robo-viruses...

752
01:22:51,699 --> 01:22:55,135
that latch on to any living
organism and suck the carbon out...

753
01:22:55,236 --> 01:22:59,764
till you, me, even the cockroaches
are nothing more than gray goo.

754
01:22:59,874 --> 01:23:03,275
It could wipe out an entire
continent if properly deployed.

755
01:23:03,378 --> 01:23:05,903
I had to extricate it
before Gage tried, again,

756
01:23:06,014 --> 01:23:09,415
to sell it to another combatant
country or crazed libertarian.

757
01:23:09,517 --> 01:23:14,386
So the plan,
the diamonds, us...

758
01:23:14,489 --> 01:23:17,117
was all just a crock?

759
01:23:17,225 --> 01:23:21,252
No. Not us, Trix.

760
01:23:21,362 --> 01:23:25,162
What I am doesn't change
how I feel about you.

761
01:23:25,266 --> 01:23:27,234
Everything
between us is real.

762
01:23:30,038 --> 01:23:32,268
You've changed me.

763
01:23:33,608 --> 01:23:36,168
Made me see a life
I've been missing.

764
01:23:37,478 --> 01:23:41,972
Craving really.

765
01:23:42,083 --> 01:23:45,610
I'm through
being Foxy 69.

766
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:48,621
But you can't just walk
away from Flesh Force Foxy...

767
01:23:48,723 --> 01:23:50,691
with a wink
and a hi-dee-ho.

768
01:23:50,792 --> 01:23:53,352
I needed leverage
and a huge bankroll.

769
01:23:53,461 --> 01:23:56,021
The vial and the diamonds give us both.

770
01:23:57,832 --> 01:24:03,771
Now you, Lily and me can slip off to
a small Micronesian island together...

771
01:24:03,871 --> 01:24:06,203
forever.

772
01:24:07,709 --> 01:24:09,939
And playfully wrestle
in the surf?

773
01:24:12,347 --> 01:24:14,713
Among other things.

774
01:24:16,784 --> 01:24:17,808
I love you.
Mmm.

775
01:24:31,499 --> 01:24:34,059
The bitch is back, baby.

776
01:24:46,347 --> 01:24:51,216
- Oh, yeah!
- Hang on, Trixie. Hang on.

777
01:24:51,319 --> 01:24:56,347
Fuck me!
Who says drugs are bad for you?

778
01:24:56,457 --> 01:25:01,485
It hurts, doesn't it? Having
someone you love taken away.

779
01:25:01,596 --> 01:25:03,530
It wasn't her fault,
Camero.

780
01:25:03,631 --> 01:25:06,566
Fuck you!
It was all her fault.

781
01:25:06,668 --> 01:25:08,659
I have nothing.

782
01:25:08,770 --> 01:25:11,534
Nothing!

783
01:25:11,639 --> 01:25:14,335
And it's all
because of her and you.

784
01:25:20,248 --> 01:25:24,617
I'm gonna booty-bang
bitch slap your fucking ass...

785
01:25:24,719 --> 01:25:27,950
until you're
just this side of salvage.

786
01:25:28,056 --> 01:25:32,083
Then I'm gonna ram-ride
girly's show tits asunder...

787
01:25:32,193 --> 01:25:35,594
before I plow
both of you bitches under!

788
01:27:15,930 --> 01:27:18,899
Open wide, psycho slut!

789
01:27:24,272 --> 01:27:26,866
Lube my boobs,
skank twat!

790
01:28:06,481 --> 01:28:08,381
You had enough?

791
01:28:08,483 --> 01:28:11,941
No. You?

792
01:28:14,989 --> 01:28:16,889
Blow me.

793
01:28:25,633 --> 01:28:27,567
Fuck layin' tube!

794
01:28:29,337 --> 01:28:33,797
- Fuck wad!
- Lick my love pup!

795
01:28:55,830 --> 01:28:58,094
Blow my biscuit!

796
01:29:23,691 --> 01:29:25,420
No.

797
01:29:30,197 --> 01:29:31,687
Camero, stop!

798
01:29:45,112 --> 01:29:47,774
No! Please, no! Stop!

799
01:29:47,882 --> 01:29:49,611
No!

800
01:30:01,596 --> 01:30:04,463
No. No. Hel, no!

801
01:30:16,444 --> 01:30:19,538
Just us now, Buttercups.

802
01:30:19,647 --> 01:30:23,515
Stay away from me.
Stay away from me!

803
01:30:23,618 --> 01:30:28,487
Mrs. Honeypot,
can Trixie come out to die?

804
01:30:30,992 --> 01:30:33,085
Stop! No! No! No!

805
01:30:34,128 --> 01:30:36,096
Come on. Fight me!

806
01:30:38,432 --> 01:30:41,663
I'm too weak and vulnerable.

807
01:30:41,769 --> 01:30:45,364
Fine. If you won't fight,
then you got to fuck.

808
01:30:45,473 --> 01:30:48,271
Prepare to come about,
bitch. Camero, stop!

809
01:30:48,376 --> 01:30:51,743
- Time to get me some of what Hel's been gettin'.
- Stop! Stop, please!

810
01:30:51,846 --> 01:30:53,575
Don't! Please!

811
01:30:55,783 --> 01:30:58,343
Hello, kitty.

812
01:31:20,174 --> 01:31:22,074
Yeah!

813
01:31:31,218 --> 01:31:35,177
I'm gonna baste your
giblets, butter britches.

814
01:31:41,829 --> 01:31:44,798
You're her?

815
01:31:45,833 --> 01:31:48,802
You're my best lay ever?

816
01:31:50,104 --> 01:31:52,629
Surprise.

817
01:31:52,740 --> 01:31:55,903
You lying fucking whore!

818
01:32:02,116 --> 01:32:06,576
The women's movement will
hoist my skirt for all eternity.

819
01:32:56,137 --> 01:32:58,105
Oh, my God.

820
01:32:59,740 --> 01:33:01,970
Oh, my God.

821
01:33:02,076 --> 01:33:04,101
How did it come to this?

822
01:33:29,184 --> 01:33:31,584
How did it come to this?

823
01:33:31,686 --> 01:33:35,019
I'll tell you.
Human nature.

824
01:33:36,591 --> 01:33:40,755
Early Christianity tells us of
humanity's seven deadly sins.

825
01:33:42,030 --> 01:33:45,329
I'm unclear whether lust,
gluttony, greed, sloth,

826
01:33:45,433 --> 01:33:49,597
wrath, envy and pride
are human sins...

827
01:33:49,704 --> 01:33:53,868
or defining
human characteristics.

828
01:33:57,479 --> 01:34:00,573
Foxy 69,
target on sight.

829
01:34:00,682 --> 01:34:02,081
Roger that.

830
01:34:02,183 --> 01:34:04,617
Foxy down in 20, 19,

831
01:34:04,719 --> 01:34:07,552
18, 17...

832
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:55,561
Foxy 69 in position.

833
01:34:58,206 --> 01:35:00,140
Hold it. We'll take those.

834
01:35:09,184 --> 01:35:11,778
Ooh. That's a bit
frightening, isn't it?

835
01:35:15,590 --> 01:35:17,285
Foxy, take 'em out.

836
01:35:18,760 --> 01:35:22,423
Help me!

837
01:35:28,737 --> 01:35:31,171
Oh, my God.

838
01:36:25,827 --> 01:36:27,692
Camero!

839
01:36:34,769 --> 01:36:36,430
What the fuck is that?

840
01:37:13,308 --> 01:37:15,936
Bite me!

841
01:37:34,028 --> 01:37:36,087
Oh, yeah.

842
01:39:32,814 --> 01:39:34,873
Trixie, why?

843
01:39:35,817 --> 01:39:37,284
What can I say?

844
01:39:39,287 --> 01:39:42,085
We're all just bitches
in the end.

845
01:40:07,548 --> 01:40:09,982
Who are you?

846
01:40:10,084 --> 01:40:12,644
I think you know.

847
01:40:14,255 --> 01:40:16,189
But why me?

848
01:40:16,290 --> 01:40:18,315
Why Camero?

849
01:40:18,426 --> 01:40:20,792
You were lost souls,

850
01:40:20,895 --> 01:40:22,954
and I thought
it would be fun.

851
01:40:24,432 --> 01:40:28,368
- And Phoenix?
- Phoenix works for me.

852
01:40:28,469 --> 01:40:31,438
Always has... or did.

853
01:40:31,539 --> 01:40:33,439
He got careless.

854
01:40:33,541 --> 01:40:36,169
I guess we know
where that ended up.

855
01:40:39,080 --> 01:40:41,446
So this whole thing...

856
01:40:41,549 --> 01:40:44,416
my mission, us meeting,

857
01:40:44,519 --> 01:40:46,419
Camero...

858
01:40:50,725 --> 01:40:52,693
It was all for this.

859
01:40:54,162 --> 01:40:58,622
Made in the 16th century by
Master Craftsman Umatada Mjouji.

860
01:40:58,733 --> 01:41:03,295
This naginata has seen
battles won and empires fall...

861
01:41:03,404 --> 01:41:05,304
for over 600 years.

862
01:41:05,406 --> 01:41:08,534
It's the one thing I love
on this godforsaken Earth.

863
01:41:08,643 --> 01:41:11,976
And Gage was stupid enough
to think I didn't care.

864
01:41:14,015 --> 01:41:16,245
How could you do this?

865
01:41:16,350 --> 01:41:19,808
Play the victim?
I loved you.

866
01:41:19,921 --> 01:41:22,481
A girl's got to get
her jollies somehow.

867
01:41:22,590 --> 01:41:24,854
Oh.

868
01:41:24,959 --> 01:41:27,894
And I really get off
watching girls fight.

869
01:41:29,731 --> 01:41:33,258
- You guys were awesome.
- What are you waiting for?

870
01:41:33,367 --> 01:41:36,666
Go on.
Finish your sick little game.

871
01:41:39,707 --> 01:41:42,642
We read we ought
to forgive our enemies,

872
01:41:42,744 --> 01:41:46,202
but we do not read... That
we should forgive our friends.

873
01:41:46,314 --> 01:41:50,546
Cosimo de' Medici, 1454.

874
01:41:58,126 --> 01:41:59,821
Go to hell, Trixie!

875
01:42:03,197 --> 01:42:05,188
Last one in's
a rotten egg.

876
01:42:05,299 --> 01:42:08,097
Last one in's a rotten egg.

877
01:42:28,656 --> 01:42:31,591
"All warfare is based
on deception.

878
01:42:31,692 --> 01:42:34,991
"Hence, when able to attack,
we must seem unable.

879
01:42:35,096 --> 01:42:38,554
"When using our forces,
we must seem inactive.

880
01:42:38,666 --> 01:42:42,432
"When we are near, we must make
the enemy believe we are far away.

881
01:42:42,537 --> 01:42:45,973
"When far away, we must
make him believe we are near.

882
01:42:46,073 --> 01:42:49,133
"Hold out baits
to entice the enemy.

883
01:42:49,243 --> 01:42:53,111
Feign disorder and crush him."
