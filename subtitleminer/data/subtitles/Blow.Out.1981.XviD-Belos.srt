00:01:00,312 --> 00:01:03,189
Hey, will you guys shut up in there?

2
00:01:04,733 --> 00:01:06,401
Barbara!

3
00:01:06,526 --> 00:01:08,486
Oh, shit.

4
00:01:18,121 --> 00:01:21,499
What the hell is going on in here?
I am trying to study for a final.

5
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:24,502
Yeah, we have finals too.
Ever hear of modern dance?

6
00:01:24,628 --> 00:01:27,964
- Can't you study to music?
- No, I can't study to music!

7
00:01:28,089 --> 00:01:32,010
- Turn it down or do I have to go to Sue?
- Go to Sue, then. Fuck off.

8
00:01:32,135 --> 00:01:35,055
- I'm going to Sue!
- I'm going to Sue.

9
00:01:49,361 --> 00:01:51,363
- Oh!

10
00:01:51,488 --> 00:01:53,531
- Get off of me!
- What?

11
00:01:54,991 --> 00:01:57,035
Oh! Oh!

12
00:01:57,786 --> 00:02:01,539
Oh, there's somebody out there.
Come on! There's somebody out there!

13
00:02:01,665 --> 00:02:04,125
- There's nobody out there.
- There is!

14
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:10,674
- Calm down.
- I can't calm down.

15
00:02:10,799 --> 00:02:14,594
You better take care of it,
cos I can't study with this disco music.

16
00:02:17,847 --> 00:02:20,850
- All right, move. Come on.

17
00:02:20,976 --> 00:02:24,312
Oh, look. The little fink
brought back the master fink.

18
00:02:31,027 --> 00:02:33,238
- The music's not loud.
- Yes, it is.

19
00:03:17,741 --> 00:03:19,784
God, that scream is terrible.

20
00:03:21,911 --> 00:03:25,540
- What cat did you strangle to get that?
- That's her voice.

21
00:03:25,665 --> 00:03:27,208
- You didn't dub that?
- No.

22
00:03:27,334 --> 00:03:28,752
- That's hers?
- Yeah.

23
00:03:28,877 --> 00:03:30,921
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

24
00:03:31,546 --> 00:03:35,550
- Run it again. I wanna hear the scream.

25
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,144
- Yeah.

26
00:03:51,858 --> 00:03:54,861
And kill all the effects
except for the scream.

27
00:04:04,204 --> 00:04:06,873
- Kill it.

28
00:04:07,624 --> 00:04:10,627
You're right. It's hers. And it's shit.

29
00:04:11,211 --> 00:04:15,215
Look, Jack, I didn't hire that girl
for her scream. I hired her for her tits.

30
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:18,551
Then why worry?
Who's gonna be watching her scream?

31
00:04:18,677 --> 00:04:21,012
Wait a minute. Come on, Jack.

32
00:04:21,137 --> 00:04:24,057
Look, how many years
have we worked together?

33
00:04:27,018 --> 00:04:30,689
Let's see. I met you on Blood Bath, right?

34
00:04:30,814 --> 00:04:33,316
And then we did Blood Bath II.

35
00:04:33,441 --> 00:04:36,236
And then we did Bad Day at Blood Beach.

36
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:39,698
And then we did Bordello of Blood.

37
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,910
Well, that brings us up to date.
Co-ed Frenzy.

38
00:04:44,536 --> 00:04:47,038
By the way, I didn't tell you this but...

39
00:04:47,872 --> 00:04:50,750
I'd like to think this is our finest film.

40
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:55,130
- Almost two years.
- Oh, God. Five films in two years.

41
00:04:55,255 --> 00:05:00,927
You know what I can't figure out? Why
a smart guy like you is still doing that shit.

42
00:05:01,052 --> 00:05:03,263
Come on! You do the shit. I do the sound.

43
00:05:03,388 --> 00:05:07,392
No, you do the shit. That wind sounds
like you're whistling in the crapper!

44
00:05:07,517 --> 00:05:09,769
It's library stuff we used a million times.

45
00:05:09,894 --> 00:05:13,189
That is the trouble!
I have heard it a million times!

46
00:05:13,607 --> 00:05:16,318
- Get something new.
- New wind. Got it.

47
00:05:16,901 --> 00:05:21,615
- And that scream. We gotta dub that.
- All right. Know any good screamers?

48
00:05:23,617 --> 00:05:26,494
- I got a few ideas.
- I bet you do.

49
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,246
Just worry about the scream.

50
00:06:16,044 --> 00:06:19,297
...a sweeping condemnation
of White House policies.

51
00:06:19,422 --> 00:06:22,884
The same poll gave evidence
of a ground swell of support

52
00:06:23,009 --> 00:06:26,179
for Governor George McRyan
in his bid for nomination.

53
00:06:26,304 --> 00:06:31,559
If an election were held today, Governor
McRyan would win hands down,

54
00:06:31,685 --> 00:06:36,231
drawing a remarkable 62 per cent
of the vote to the president's 23.

55
00:06:36,356 --> 00:06:40,193
The president's campaign manager,
Jack Manners, told reporters. :

56
00:06:40,318 --> 00:06:43,947
The president's had to make
some tough decisions.

57
00:06:44,072 --> 00:06:46,992
But when these policies are carried out

58
00:06:47,117 --> 00:06:51,663
and the economic climate improves,
as we confidently expect it will,

59
00:06:52,539 --> 00:06:57,460
the people will rally to support
the president in the upcoming primaries.

60
00:06:58,712 --> 00:07:01,339
A lot can happen between now and then.

61
00:07:01,464 --> 00:07:06,553
Congress waits anxiously for Governor
McRyan to declare his candidacy.

62
00:07:06,678 --> 00:07:10,932
They may not have long to wait. The
governor is now at the Bellevue Stratford

63
00:07:11,057 --> 00:07:16,187
where he will soon address the kickoff
dinner of the Liberty Day celebration.

64
00:07:16,313 --> 00:07:20,108
Some people think he will use the
occasion to throw his hat into the ring.

65
00:07:20,233 --> 00:07:23,111
Joan, any word
from the Bellevue Stratford yet?

66
00:07:23,236 --> 00:07:26,865
Not yet, Bill, but as soon as there is,
we will be going there live.

67
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:32,329
Liberty Day is one of the most eagerly
awaited of all Philadelphia celebrations.

68
00:07:32,454 --> 00:07:35,373
But this year it's going to be extra special.

69
00:07:35,498 --> 00:07:40,754
It is 1 00 years since the Liberty Bell
was last rung. To honour this centennial,

70
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:43,840
...a parade on Saturday

71
00:07:43,965 --> 00:07:49,346
will end up at Penn's Landing
with a spectacular display of fireworks.

72
00:07:49,471 --> 00:07:53,016
In addition, a full-size replica
of the Liberty Bell has been made

73
00:07:53,141 --> 00:07:57,479
from pennies donated by schoolchildren
from every state in the Union.

74
00:07:57,604 --> 00:08:01,107
And they'll be ringing it
after the fireworks at Penn's Landing.

75
00:08:01,232 --> 00:08:03,109
That's right.

76
00:08:03,234 --> 00:08:06,488
- Hold it. We've got the Bellevue Stratford.

77
00:08:06,613 --> 00:08:10,325
Let's go live to our political
correspondent, Frank Donahue,

78
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:13,536
at the Liberty Ball
at the Bellevue Stratford Hotel.

79
00:08:13,662 --> 00:08:17,582
Frank, you look fabulous.
Have you spoken with the governor yet?

80
00:08:17,707 --> 00:08:20,877
- Yes, Joan, briefly. He just arrived.

81
00:08:21,002 --> 00:08:26,091
I did ask the governor his impression
so far of this year's Liberty Day Jubilee.

82
00:08:26,216 --> 00:08:28,260
He said he was honoured to be here

83
00:08:28,385 --> 00:08:32,681
and plans to attend the parade and the
ringing of the new bell on Saturday night.

84
00:08:32,806 --> 00:08:36,518
He felt it a shame the Liberty Bell
had been silenced for so long.

85
00:08:37,769 --> 00:08:41,106
He looked forward to a new voice
of liberty throughout the land.

86
00:08:41,231 --> 00:08:47,195
The governor is now greeting friends and
will be enjoying a meal in the ballroom.

87
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:51,950
But his people have told us
that he will speak to us after that meal.

88
00:08:53,201 --> 00:08:56,663
I'm Frank Donahue. "Eye on the City"
News, Bellevue Stratford.

89
00:08:57,455 --> 00:09:00,875
Thank you, Frank.
We'll be getting back to you later on.

90
00:09:01,001 --> 00:09:03,878
Meanwhile, in other news,
a teacher's strike...

91
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:48,506
Let's take a walk
along the river here.

92
00:09:50,675 --> 00:09:52,719
Mm. Nice.

93
00:09:54,095 --> 00:09:57,974
- David, look. Someone's on the bridge.
- Let's not worry about that.

94
00:09:58,099 --> 00:10:00,268
- He's staring right at us.
- Who cares?

95
00:10:00,393 --> 00:10:02,020
- I care.
- Betsy.

96
00:10:02,145 --> 00:10:05,148
- I don't wanna stay here. Let's go.
- Yeah, OK.

97
00:10:05,273 --> 00:10:07,442
- What is he doing?
- I don't know.

98
00:10:07,567 --> 00:10:12,238
- What is he, a Peeping Tom?
- Oh, who cares? Let's walk down there.

99
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:47,626
Jesus Christ.

100
00:12:25,205 --> 00:12:27,457
Oh, God! Please help me!

101
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,381
Get me out of here, please!

102
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,766
Oh! Oh, God!

103
00:14:02,844 --> 00:14:05,263
- A bang?
- Yeah, some sort of a bang.

104
00:14:05,388 --> 00:14:07,515
- Where?
- I'm not sure where.

105
00:14:07,641 --> 00:14:09,392
- You were facing the car?
- Yes.

106
00:14:09,517 --> 00:14:11,019
Well, you heard the blowout.

107
00:14:11,144 --> 00:14:13,521
Yes, but the first sound
I heard was a bang.

108
00:14:13,647 --> 00:14:15,690
- Some kind of an echo.
- No.

109
00:14:15,815 --> 00:14:19,069
Look, I know what an echo sounds like.
I'm a sound man.

110
00:14:19,194 --> 00:14:21,988
And the bang was before the blowout.

111
00:14:22,113 --> 00:14:25,992
- What were you doin' up there?
- I was recording sounds for a movie.

112
00:14:26,117 --> 00:14:28,578
- You recorded the accident?
- Yes.

113
00:14:30,747 --> 00:14:32,666
What happened after that?

114
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:35,335
The car went off the road
into the creek and I...

115
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,921
- What did you do then?
- I'm tryin' to tell you.

116
00:14:38,046 --> 00:14:41,508
I ran down, jumped in the creek
and pulled out the girl.

117
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,970
- There was a girl?
- Yes, there was a girl.

118
00:14:45,095 --> 00:14:48,640
- What girl?
- The girl I brought here. In the room.

119
00:14:48,765 --> 00:14:50,809
She was inside the car?

120
00:14:51,601 --> 00:14:53,645
- Yes.
- Are you sure?

121
00:14:54,854 --> 00:14:57,357
I wasn't bobbing for apples.
Of course I'm sure.

122
00:14:57,482 --> 00:14:59,943
It can get pretty dark
under eight feet of water.

123
00:15:00,068 --> 00:15:05,740
Is this known as obtaining objective
eyewitness testimony? If it is, forget it.

124
00:15:06,449 --> 00:15:09,536
We gotta get the stretcher through.
Step back.

125
00:15:23,883 --> 00:15:25,844
Doctor! How is she?

126
00:15:25,969 --> 00:15:31,224
Very lucky. Mild shock, some cuts
and bruises. No major injuries.

127
00:15:31,349 --> 00:15:34,811
- Can I see her?
- She might be asleep. She's sedated.

128
00:15:34,936 --> 00:15:37,731
- I'll just say goodbye.
- Don't stay too long.

129
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,944
How you doin'?

130
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:48,325
- Do you have my purse?
- No.

131
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:51,828
I'm sure the police'll find it.
I wouldn't worry about it.

132
00:15:51,953 --> 00:15:53,622
I know.

133
00:15:53,747 --> 00:15:56,207
- Where are you going?
- I have to leave now.

134
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:59,336
Wait a minute. I think
you'd better get back to bed.

135
00:15:59,461 --> 00:16:03,423
I don't think they're finished
with you yet. Come on, up. Up.

136
00:16:03,548 --> 00:16:05,592
- Just for a minute.
- All right.

137
00:16:06,635 --> 00:16:08,678
So how do you feel?

138
00:16:09,846 --> 00:16:12,599
He said I was lucky-the doctor.

139
00:16:12,724 --> 00:16:15,018
Yeah. He should've been there, huh?

140
00:16:17,479 --> 00:16:20,273
- Thanks for getting me out.
- No problem.

141
00:16:22,567 --> 00:16:25,528
I didn't realise you were this pretty,
with all that mud.

142
00:16:25,654 --> 00:16:28,281
I don't have any make-up on!

143
00:16:28,865 --> 00:16:32,452
Well, don't worry about it.
It's fine. It's a hospital.

144
00:16:32,577 --> 00:16:35,830
- Who are you?
- I'm Jack Terry. Who are you?

145
00:16:37,749 --> 00:16:41,503
- Sally.
- Sally? Nice to meet you, Sally.

146
00:16:53,348 --> 00:16:55,392
Are you leaving?

147
00:16:56,017 --> 00:16:58,061
Yeah, I gotta go. But...

148
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:03,400
How about, when you get outta here,
we have a drink sometime? In a glass.

149
00:17:03,942 --> 00:17:05,902
- Sure.
- OK. You take care.

150
00:17:06,027 --> 00:17:08,363
How about tonight?

151
00:17:08,488 --> 00:17:13,034
No, I don't think so, Sally. Not tonight.
But I'll ask the doctor when you get out.

152
00:17:13,159 --> 00:17:17,038
- He wants to keep me for observation.
- Sally, you gotta stay in bed.

153
00:17:17,163 --> 00:17:19,666
I don't like to be observed.

154
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:22,627
I'm sorry, but there's nothing
I can do about that.

155
00:17:22,794 --> 00:17:26,923
Please. I really don't like hospitals.
I've got to get out of here.

156
00:17:27,048 --> 00:17:31,553
All right. I'll make you a deal, OK?
You stay here, I'll get your clothes,

157
00:17:31,678 --> 00:17:35,765
and when I come back, we'll go out
and have a drink, OK? All right?

158
00:17:36,683 --> 00:17:39,394
- I need shoes and a coat.
- Yes. I'll get them.

159
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:42,230
But if you don't stay, I'm not comin' back.

160
00:17:42,355 --> 00:17:44,399
- OK.
- All right.

161
00:18:03,001 --> 00:18:06,254
It looks like
she's gonna be all right.

162
00:18:06,379 --> 00:18:10,050
This guy, Jack Terry, that took her
out of the car, he's over there.

163
00:18:10,175 --> 00:18:15,055
He's being a real horse's ass. I don't know
how we're gonna keep the lid on this guy.

164
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:18,767
Get some men here. I want this place
sealed. I don't want this circus.

165
00:18:18,892 --> 00:18:22,854
Sir, this is the guy. He was there when
it happened. He saw the whole thing.

166
00:18:22,979 --> 00:18:27,609
- He's the one who saw it?
- Yes. He pulled the girl out of the car.

167
00:18:32,656 --> 00:18:35,951
I wanna talk to you.
And to the girl too. Where is she?

168
00:18:36,076 --> 00:18:37,953
- She's in there.
- She's asleep.

169
00:18:38,078 --> 00:18:41,414
And if you wanna talk to me,
make it quick, cos I wanna go home.

170
00:18:41,539 --> 00:18:44,960
- There someplace we can talk in private?
- I'll take care of it.

171
00:18:45,085 --> 00:18:48,630
- Would you secure that room for us?
- I want these men checked out.

172
00:18:48,755 --> 00:18:52,801
- Officer, what's goin' on here?
- Car accident. Guy got killed.

173
00:18:52,926 --> 00:18:56,846
- I know, but what's the big deal?
- Did you know the guy was McRyan?

174
00:18:56,972 --> 00:18:58,348
Governor McRyan?

175
00:18:58,473 --> 00:19:02,394
That stiff on the stretcher
was probably our next president.

176
00:19:03,603 --> 00:19:05,772
- Hell, he had my vote.
- Jesus Christ.

177
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:11,403
Let's talk in here.

178
00:19:21,496 --> 00:19:24,583
- You pulled the girl out of that car?
- Yes.

179
00:19:25,834 --> 00:19:30,297
Well, I would like for you to forget
about her. Forget you ever saw her.

180
00:19:31,172 --> 00:19:33,008
Wait a minute.

181
00:19:33,133 --> 00:19:35,969
- Who are you?
- My name is Lawrence Henry.

182
00:19:36,094 --> 00:19:39,222
- I worked for Governor McRyan.
- Ah.

183
00:19:39,347 --> 00:19:41,391
He was also a friend.

184
00:19:42,642 --> 00:19:44,686
He was my friend.

185
00:19:46,396 --> 00:19:48,940
Look, I'm very sorry about the governor,

186
00:19:49,065 --> 00:19:53,737
and I obviously would have loved
to have saved his life too, but...

187
00:19:54,654 --> 00:19:57,157
I mean, I was there and she was there.

188
00:19:57,282 --> 00:20:00,994
We know what happened,
but the governor is dead now and...

189
00:20:02,037 --> 00:20:04,998
we don't want to embarrass his family.

190
00:20:05,123 --> 00:20:08,877
Do you have any idea what the press
would do if they got ahold of this?

191
00:20:09,002 --> 00:20:12,255
You want me to say she wasn't there?
I already told the police.

192
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,424
That's already taken care of.

193
00:20:17,427 --> 00:20:22,641
- All right. What about the girl?
- I'll talk to her. She'll cooperate.

194
00:20:22,766 --> 00:20:26,645
Just one playmate just vanishes
from McRyan's car, just like that?

195
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:29,981
- That's right.
- Aw, Jesus, I don't know.

196
00:20:30,106 --> 00:20:35,070
Can't you keep your mouth shut?
It's better the governor died alone.

197
00:20:36,655 --> 00:20:40,116
I just don't know if I can do that.
I was there, she was there, and...

198
00:20:40,242 --> 00:20:43,245
Who gives a damn that you were there?!

199
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:47,540
You wanna tell his wife that he died
with his hand up some girl's dress?

200
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:50,752
- Or let her read it in the papers?
- That is what happened.

201
00:20:50,877 --> 00:20:55,548
- That is the truth, isn't it?
- What difference does that make to you?

202
00:20:57,801 --> 00:21:01,846
But it would make a great deal
of difference to his family.

203
00:21:09,604 --> 00:21:10,397
All right.

204
00:21:10,522 --> 00:21:13,733
Good. We'll slip you
and the girl out the back.

205
00:21:20,365 --> 00:21:22,659
How about your place?

206
00:21:22,784 --> 00:21:24,828
You don't wanna go home, do you?

207
00:21:26,871 --> 00:21:31,084
- They told you who was in the car, right?
- Yeah.

208
00:21:31,209 --> 00:21:36,256
Well, some smart reporter could
figure I was there too, you know?

209
00:21:36,381 --> 00:21:40,510
They got my purse
with my name and address.

210
00:21:40,635 --> 00:21:43,138
They're gonna be camped
on my doorstep.

211
00:21:43,263 --> 00:21:47,559
What about my doorstep? I'm the one who
pulled you out of that wreck, didn't I?

212
00:21:47,684 --> 00:21:49,728
Yeah, right.

213
00:21:49,853 --> 00:21:51,896
Let's go to a motel.

214
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:59,446
First it's a drink, then it's my place,
now it's a motel.

215
00:21:59,571 --> 00:22:01,823
Things are movin' fast tonight, Sally.

216
00:22:13,585 --> 00:22:15,587
Whoops.

217
00:22:15,712 --> 00:22:17,756
Stand here for a second.

218
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:29,077
- Beautiful night for a walk.
- Yes, it is.

219
00:23:30,161 --> 00:23:33,623
Let's take a walk
along the river here.

220
00:23:33,748 --> 00:23:36,668
- Mm. Nice.
- David, look.

221
00:23:36,793 --> 00:23:39,713
- Someone's on the bridge.
- Let's not worry about that.

222
00:23:39,838 --> 00:23:42,007
- He's staring right at us.
- Who cares?

223
00:23:42,132 --> 00:23:43,842
- I care.
- Betsy.

224
00:23:43,967 --> 00:23:46,928
- I don't wanna stay here. Let's go.
- Yeah, OK.

225
00:23:47,053 --> 00:23:49,139
- What is he doing?
- I don't know.

226
00:23:49,264 --> 00:23:53,893
- What is he, a Peeping Tom?
- Oh, who cares? Let's walk down there.

227
00:25:02,879 --> 00:25:04,089
Jesus Christ.

228
00:25:32,951 --> 00:25:34,995
Shit.

229
00:27:42,455 --> 00:27:44,916
So, uh... you want some coffee?

230
00:27:47,627 --> 00:27:51,423
- Huh? You want some coffee?
- Mm! Good morning.

231
00:27:51,548 --> 00:27:53,842
- Hi. How you doin'?
- I'm fine. How are you?

232
00:27:53,967 --> 00:27:56,720
Pretty good. There you go.

233
00:27:56,845 --> 00:28:00,765
What are you doin' here?
You listenin' to some music?

234
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:05,437
Nope. This is my... This is my job.

235
00:28:05,562 --> 00:28:08,732
- I do sound effects for movies.
- Oh, movies, huh?

236
00:28:08,857 --> 00:28:11,943
Matter of fact, last night
I was out recording some sounds.

237
00:28:12,068 --> 00:28:14,112
What do you mean, sound effects?

238
00:28:14,237 --> 00:28:20,744
You know, when you see a movie and you
hear a door slam or a bird chirp or wind,

239
00:28:20,869 --> 00:28:23,371
I record those actual sounds,

240
00:28:23,496 --> 00:28:26,958
and then I put them in a movie,
and then you see the movie.

241
00:28:27,083 --> 00:28:28,501
- Oh.
- Last night...

242
00:28:28,627 --> 00:28:30,754
- Big movies?
- No. Just...

243
00:28:30,879 --> 00:28:33,173
Just bad ones, unfortunately.

244
00:28:33,298 --> 00:28:35,592
I really love movies, you know.

245
00:28:35,717 --> 00:28:41,389
It's a very interesting subject to me
because I do make-up.

246
00:28:41,514 --> 00:28:46,144
Right now it's only behind a counter, but
I dream about doin' make-up for movies.

247
00:28:46,269 --> 00:28:50,482
I've seen these big movie stars
like Barbra Streisand, you know?

248
00:28:51,316 --> 00:28:53,485
- They don't do it right.
- No.

249
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:57,113
- I know how to fix a face.
- Really? That's good.

250
00:28:57,781 --> 00:28:59,991
I want you to hear something. Look.

251
00:29:01,243 --> 00:29:06,081
Last night I was recording some sounds,
and I recorded your accident.

252
00:29:06,206 --> 00:29:08,124
I got the whole thing on tape.

253
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:11,044
- Oh. You recorded the accident.
- Yes, I did.

254
00:29:11,169 --> 00:29:15,298
Except I don't think you had an accident.
I think your tyre was shot out.

255
00:29:15,423 --> 00:29:18,385
- That's crazy.
- No, it's not. Listen to this.

256
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:23,848
You're gonna hear two sounds. The first
is a gunshot, and the second is a blowout.

257
00:29:23,974 --> 00:29:26,017
All right? Listen up.

258
00:29:34,609 --> 00:29:37,737
- Now listen again.
- I heard a noise. Maybe it was a gunshot.

259
00:29:37,862 --> 00:29:42,200
But, I'll tell you, I don't really feature
listenin' to a replay of last night.

260
00:29:42,325 --> 00:29:44,369
It's kinda depressing.

261
00:29:44,494 --> 00:29:46,621
- Can I ask you something?
- What?

262
00:29:46,746 --> 00:29:48,873
What were you doing with McRyan?

263
00:29:51,459 --> 00:29:55,839
That's a very personal question.
That's none of your business.

264
00:29:55,964 --> 00:29:59,384
- I don't mean the details. I just...
- I'm gettin' a cold here.

265
00:29:59,509 --> 00:30:01,678
- Forget it, Sally.
- Personal questions.

266
00:30:01,803 --> 00:30:05,181
- I don't even know who you are.
- I'd like you to get to know who I am.

267
00:30:05,307 --> 00:30:08,143
- How about that drink?
- Some other time, OK?

268
00:30:08,268 --> 00:30:12,731
Sally, I saved your life. The least
you could do is have a drink with me.

269
00:30:14,816 --> 00:30:19,237
All right. You can call me at my girlfriend
Judy Demming's. I'll be there.

270
00:30:19,362 --> 00:30:23,158
- She's in the book.
- All right. You tellin' me the truth?

271
00:30:23,283 --> 00:30:25,744
- Yeah.
- All right. I'm gonna call you.

272
00:30:25,869 --> 00:30:27,078
OK.

273
00:30:56,107 --> 00:30:59,527
Jack. They got movies of McRyan
gettin' killed. I just heard.

274
00:30:59,653 --> 00:31:01,488
- Maybe it's on the news.
- What?

275
00:31:01,613 --> 00:31:03,531
Movies of McRyan gettin' killed!

276
00:31:04,115 --> 00:31:07,410
Incredible as it may seem,
a local photographer, Manny Karp,

277
00:31:07,535 --> 00:31:10,330
was on the scene of the accident
with his camera.

278
00:31:10,455 --> 00:31:16,086
Mr Karp sold his film to "News Today"
magazine this morning...

279
00:31:16,211 --> 00:31:18,380
- News Today...
- Shh.

280
00:31:18,505 --> 00:31:21,883
Our own Frank Donahue spoke
with Mr Karp just a few moments ago

281
00:31:22,008 --> 00:31:24,761
outside the magazine's offices.

282
00:31:25,136 --> 00:31:29,266
Well, I'll tell ya. I had gone out there
to try out this new film stock, right?

283
00:31:29,391 --> 00:31:34,562
It's a very high speed. It's good for
night shooting. I do a lotta work at night.

284
00:31:34,688 --> 00:31:40,235
So I'm out there and all of a sudden I hear
this car barrellin' down the road.

285
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:44,781
I didn't pay too much attention till
all of a sudden I hear it startin' to skid.

286
00:31:44,906 --> 00:31:49,578
I turn around, my camera's runnin'
and I catch him goin' through the railing.

287
00:31:49,703 --> 00:31:52,998
Mr Karp. Frank Donahue,
"Eye on the City" News.

288
00:31:53,123 --> 00:31:55,917
Mr Karp, was the governor driving?
Was he in control?

289
00:31:56,042 --> 00:31:59,045
Control? It went into the drink.
He wasn't in no control.

290
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:01,923
- Was he alone in the car?
- I didn't see anybody.

291
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:05,677
- Why didn't you go to the police?
- Oh, no. No, no, no.

292
00:32:05,802 --> 00:32:08,680
- No cop ever did anything for me.
- Hey, Jack.

293
00:32:08,805 --> 00:32:11,516
They ain't gonna give me money
like these guys here.

294
00:32:11,641 --> 00:32:13,351
- Where you goin'?
- I gotta go.

295
00:32:13,476 --> 00:32:16,563
You gotta go? What about the auditions?

296
00:32:16,688 --> 00:32:19,566
Exclusive photos. McRyan's death.

297
00:32:19,691 --> 00:32:23,403
One at a time, please.
Exclusive photos. McRyan's death.

298
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:27,324
- It's about time.
- Is Rick in?

299
00:32:27,449 --> 00:32:32,078
- No. But Sam's got girls for you to hear.
- Give me his key. Come on, come on.

300
00:32:32,704 --> 00:32:35,790
- What about Sam and the girls?
- I'll do it later.

301
00:32:51,598 --> 00:32:53,516
- Jack?

302
00:32:53,642 --> 00:32:55,685
Yo, Jack!

303
00:32:56,353 --> 00:32:59,022
Come on, open up! It's Sam!

304
00:32:59,856 --> 00:33:01,900
Jack.

305
00:35:10,987 --> 00:35:14,282
This is the pivotal moment in the film.
You gotta realise that.

306
00:35:14,407 --> 00:35:17,369
- Jack! Where are you goin'?
- Sam, I'll be right back.

307
00:35:17,494 --> 00:35:19,955
I need you now! Now get in here!

308
00:35:24,459 --> 00:35:26,503
- What do you think?
- Keep lookin'.

309
00:35:26,628 --> 00:35:28,713
Keep lookin'? Hey, Jack!

310
00:35:43,728 --> 00:35:48,775
- Sorry, Jack. I'm all stacked up.
- Please, just this once, as a favour to me.

311
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,528
I'll see what I can do.
Come back after midnight.

312
00:35:52,654 --> 00:35:54,698
Sally? It's Jack.

313
00:35:55,282 --> 00:35:57,784
See? I told you I'd call you.

314
00:35:57,909 --> 00:36:00,370
How about that drink you promised?

315
00:36:03,373 --> 00:36:05,417
Where are you goin'?

316
00:36:07,294 --> 00:36:09,421
Why don't I meet you at the station?

317
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,307
Sally!

318
00:36:20,432 --> 00:36:21,766
Hi!

319
00:36:21,891 --> 00:36:25,103
- I'm so glad I caught you.
- Yeah, I was out the door.

320
00:36:26,479 --> 00:36:28,273
Look, I only got 20 minutes.

321
00:36:28,398 --> 00:36:32,152
That's fine. We'll have a quick drink
and you'll be on your way.

322
00:36:32,277 --> 00:36:34,863
Well... I wanna get
a good seat, you know?

323
00:36:34,988 --> 00:36:38,950
- Aw, come on, Sally. You promised me.
- OK, but just 10 minutes.

324
00:36:39,075 --> 00:36:42,162
- OK. Come on. Let me take this.
- OK. Thanks.

325
00:36:42,996 --> 00:36:45,040
- How are you feelin'?
- Pretty good.

326
00:36:45,165 --> 00:36:47,208
- You look nice.
- Thanks.

327
00:36:56,927 --> 00:37:01,348
What's the first thing you see
when you meet somebody?

328
00:37:01,473 --> 00:37:03,934
Legs. I'm a leg man.

329
00:37:05,977 --> 00:37:08,730
- Come on!
- All right. Face. You see their face.

330
00:37:08,855 --> 00:37:10,357
Exactly.

331
00:37:10,482 --> 00:37:16,905
So, if your face doesn't look right,
no one is gonna look at you again.

332
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:20,951
- I don't think your face needs make-up.
- Every face needs make-up.

333
00:37:21,076 --> 00:37:23,578
- But it shouldn't look like make-up.
- Oh, I see.

334
00:37:23,703 --> 00:37:29,251
I've worked on this face. I've hidden
everything so you don't see the make-up.

335
00:37:29,376 --> 00:37:32,170
- You got make-up on right now?
- Yeah, I do.

336
00:37:32,295 --> 00:37:36,049
- I don't believe it. I don't believe it!
- Absolutely.

337
00:37:36,174 --> 00:37:40,553
And, you see, this took me two hours.
And this is the "no make-up look".

338
00:37:40,679 --> 00:37:44,975
Really? I'd like to see what the "make-up
look" looks like. I bet that's good, huh?

339
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:48,770
Well, I... I only do that
for special occasions.

340
00:37:48,895 --> 00:37:51,856
How about a broken nose?
How would you deal with that?

341
00:37:51,982 --> 00:37:55,068
Oh, that's easy. You just take a little...

342
00:37:55,193 --> 00:37:58,947
Wait a minute.
Let me see. I can show you.

343
00:37:59,072 --> 00:38:01,491
Yeah. You get a brush like this, right?

344
00:38:01,616 --> 00:38:03,994
You take a little brown powder.

345
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:07,205
- You just make a little brown...
- What are you doin'?

346
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:10,125
Hey, wait a minute.
This is serious business here.

347
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:13,044
- You interested or not?
- Oh, yes. OK. Sorry.

348
00:38:13,169 --> 00:38:15,630
You make a brown line
and kinda smudge it in.

349
00:38:15,755 --> 00:38:19,426
It has to be real subtle
so as no one'll notice it.

350
00:38:19,551 --> 00:38:22,637
But... What are you smiling about?

351
00:38:22,762 --> 00:38:25,807
I'm impressed that
you know so much about this.

352
00:38:25,932 --> 00:38:28,435
- You're not interested at all.
- Yes, I am.

353
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:32,147
You're not. You just kept me
sittin' here talkin' so I'd miss my train.

354
00:38:32,272 --> 00:38:35,317
That's not true, Sally.
I just didn't want you to go.

355
00:38:35,442 --> 00:38:36,443
Why?

356
00:38:36,568 --> 00:38:39,863
Because I like you, and I just met you
and you're goin' off on me.

357
00:38:39,988 --> 00:38:44,701
- I don't know anything about you.
- I'll tell you anything you wanna know.

358
00:38:46,494 --> 00:38:49,539
- All right. You're a sound man, right?
- Yeah.

359
00:38:49,664 --> 00:38:51,833
OK. How'd you get that job?

360
00:38:51,958 --> 00:38:54,336
That's a good question. I don't know.

361
00:38:55,545 --> 00:38:58,715
No, I'll tell ya. It all started in school, OK?

362
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:03,178
I was the kind of kid who fixed radios,
made my own stereos,

363
00:39:03,303 --> 00:39:06,097
won all the science fairs -
you know the type.

364
00:39:06,222 --> 00:39:10,143
After that I went into the army,
and I refined my skills there.

365
00:39:10,268 --> 00:39:13,021
Oh, yeah? Were you
in any wars or anything?

366
00:39:13,146 --> 00:39:18,401
No, no. I was such a communication whiz,
they wouldn't let me leave New Jersey.

367
00:39:18,526 --> 00:39:22,697
Then I went into the police for a while,
and after that I went into movies.

368
00:39:22,822 --> 00:39:25,116
Wait a minute. You were a cop?

369
00:39:25,242 --> 00:39:28,286
- No. I worked for the Kean Commission.
- What's that?

370
00:39:28,411 --> 00:39:32,457
A group of politicians that got together
to try to stop police corruption.

371
00:39:32,582 --> 00:39:35,377
- Oh.
- Then I quit that and...

372
00:39:35,502 --> 00:39:37,587
Well, what'd you do?

373
00:39:37,712 --> 00:39:43,510
- It's a long story. You don't wanna know.
- Oh, I do. This is very interesting.

374
00:39:44,594 --> 00:39:46,888
I thought you wanted
to know about movies.

375
00:39:47,013 --> 00:39:52,310
Yeah, movies are great, but this is... this is
like real life on the streets. You know?

376
00:39:52,435 --> 00:39:54,479
It's exciting.

377
00:39:56,314 --> 00:39:58,358
All right.

378
00:39:58,483 --> 00:40:04,197
l, um... I wired their best undercover cop.
A guy by the name of Freddie Corso.

379
00:40:04,322 --> 00:40:07,909
And one of Freddie's cases
was to set up a corrupt police captain

380
00:40:08,034 --> 00:40:10,203
who was tryin' to shake down a Mob guy.

381
00:40:10,328 --> 00:40:14,249
And my job was to rig a wire on him
so I could record the conversation.

382
00:40:14,374 --> 00:40:16,835
Wait a minute.
What do you mean, "wire"?

383
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:22,132
It's a tiny mike attached to a transmitter
that I strapped around Freddie's waist.

384
00:40:26,428 --> 00:40:28,471
Mackey, hand me the tape.

385
00:40:29,472 --> 00:40:34,352
- OK, Freddie, give me sound. Count to 10.
- One, two, three, four, five...

386
00:40:42,027 --> 00:40:44,863
It was a great wire.
He could be blocks away

387
00:40:44,988 --> 00:40:48,033
and you could hear everything
within 1 0 feet of him.

388
00:40:48,158 --> 00:40:51,119
- Hey, Milt! How ya doin'?
- Hello, Freddie.

389
00:40:51,244 --> 00:40:53,955
- Good to see ya.
- You look good.

390
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:57,250
- You too. You look great in that get-up.
- Thanks.

391
00:40:57,834 --> 00:41:01,171
So, uh... I brought
somebody here I want you to meet.

392
00:41:01,296 --> 00:41:03,340
Captain Kennedy, this is Milt.

393
00:41:03,465 --> 00:41:05,634
Who the fuck wants to meet him?

394
00:41:05,759 --> 00:41:09,888
- Milt, take it easy.
- Hey, I don't wanna meet him.

395
00:41:10,013 --> 00:41:14,100
Hey, take it easy. This man
could put the cap on everything.

396
00:41:14,225 --> 00:41:17,729
All right, come on in the car.
We'll take a ride and talk.

397
00:41:17,854 --> 00:41:21,358
And the first thing
that the captain says to the Mob guy. :

398
00:41:21,483 --> 00:41:24,736
Look, I understand
that the man has a brother-in-law.

399
00:41:24,861 --> 00:41:27,989
Now, I happened to see him
talkin' to his brother-in-law.

400
00:41:28,114 --> 00:41:30,867
Now, the brother-in-law
is a known felon, Freddie,

401
00:41:30,992 --> 00:41:34,287
and Milt's out on parole,
and that's a parole violation.

402
00:41:34,579 --> 00:41:40,252
Now, I'm gonna have to tell the parole
officer. If I do, he's goin' back in the can.

403
00:41:40,627 --> 00:41:45,674
But I think I could work somethin' out that
I don't have to tell him for... 5,000 bucks.

404
00:41:46,132 --> 00:41:52,180
$5,000? Freddie, you little prick.
We started this thing for $1,000.

405
00:41:52,305 --> 00:41:53,682
$1,000?!

406
00:41:53,807 --> 00:41:57,978
I'm gettin' this clear as a bell
on tape and I start to hear the static.

407
00:41:58,103 --> 00:42:02,691
You think you can ... ?
You're outta your ... !

408
00:42:02,816 --> 00:42:06,027
- We can work this thing out.

409
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:16,663
- He's goin' up the river. You understand?
- Right.

410
00:42:16,788 --> 00:42:20,292
What's the matter? You're sweatin',
Freddie. What's the matter?

411
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:25,380
The fuckin' whiz kid didn't figure
Freddie would get nervous and sweat.

412
00:42:26,381 --> 00:42:30,260
The battery in the transmitter
shorted out and burned a hole in him.

413
00:42:30,385 --> 00:42:33,847
Hey, pull over to this gas station.
I gotta take a piss.

414
00:42:58,580 --> 00:42:59,915
- Shit.
- What's wrong?

415
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:04,794
The battery in the transmitter is arcing.
It's burning him. I gotta get in there.

416
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:07,923
- You can't. You'll blow his cover.
- I gotta go in there.

417
00:43:08,048 --> 00:43:10,884
- You can't.
- My fuckin' battery burned a hole in him!

418
00:43:11,009 --> 00:43:13,386
- You're gonna screw things up!
- Shh.

419
00:43:15,847 --> 00:43:17,682
- I gotta go.
- Jack, you're nuts.

420
00:43:37,702 --> 00:43:39,746
Aw, Jesus Christ.

421
00:43:40,705 --> 00:43:42,749
Aw... no.

422
00:44:07,315 --> 00:44:11,653
- It wasn't your fault.
- Yeah, well, you tell that to Freddie.

423
00:44:11,778 --> 00:44:14,531
- Shit.
- Are you OK?

424
00:44:14,656 --> 00:44:19,786
No. Something's buggin' me. This whole
thing with Henry, the governor's assistant.

425
00:44:19,911 --> 00:44:24,291
Oh, he talked to you too, huh?
That's why I'm leavin' town.

426
00:44:24,416 --> 00:44:26,918
He gave me some money
to disappear for a while.

427
00:44:27,043 --> 00:44:31,423
I thought so. Look, they are covering up
a lot more than you being with McRyan.

428
00:44:31,548 --> 00:44:35,260
- I know that tyre was shot out.
- How can you be so sure?

429
00:44:35,385 --> 00:44:38,972
- Did you see the News Today photos?
- Yeah.

430
00:44:39,097 --> 00:44:41,391
I found a way to put my sound with them.

431
00:44:41,516 --> 00:44:45,270
And when you see it,
I'm sure you'll see it was no blowout.

432
00:44:46,730 --> 00:44:48,189
I don't know.

433
00:44:48,315 --> 00:44:51,151
Would you stick around
for a couple of days?

434
00:44:51,276 --> 00:44:54,905
- What for?
- I just think you could help me with this.

435
00:44:55,030 --> 00:45:00,744
Jack, I don't know. I'm in a helluva lot of
trouble already. If I stick around here...

436
00:45:00,869 --> 00:45:03,288
If I can just clear myself of this...

437
00:45:03,413 --> 00:45:06,499
We could go away together.
I mean... why not?

438
00:45:06,625 --> 00:45:09,920
What the hell's the sense
of goin' away by yourself?

439
00:45:11,296 --> 00:45:13,340
- I don't know.
- Come on.

440
00:45:19,679 --> 00:45:22,057
I have to think about it or somethin'.

441
00:45:26,937 --> 00:45:28,980
I'll think about it.

442
00:49:29,054 --> 00:49:31,348
Hey, Sal. How ya doin', huh?

443
00:49:31,473 --> 00:49:35,602
It's good to see... I was just hangin'
around, watchin' this great movie on TV.

444
00:49:35,727 --> 00:49:37,771
You look terrific.

445
00:49:38,396 --> 00:49:41,483
Yeah. So what are you doin' in Reading?

446
00:49:45,028 --> 00:49:49,199
Listen, you want somethin' to drink here?
How about some Scotch?

447
00:49:59,084 --> 00:50:01,127
- Yeah?
- It's Sally.

448
00:50:04,839 --> 00:50:07,926
Hey, Sal! Hey, come on in! Come in.

449
00:50:08,051 --> 00:50:10,679
You look great.
What are you doin' around here?

450
00:50:10,804 --> 00:50:13,682
Jesus, Manny.
Don't they ever clean this place?

451
00:50:13,807 --> 00:50:17,936
You gotta get up real early
to catch a maid. I haven't made it yet.

452
00:50:19,604 --> 00:50:21,898
Hey, I'm sure glad
you come by, you know?

453
00:50:22,023 --> 00:50:24,484
Listen, how'd you find me?

454
00:50:24,609 --> 00:50:29,906
- We worked this place a million times.
- Oh, that's right. Hey, you want a drink?

455
00:50:30,031 --> 00:50:33,451
- This isn't a social visit, Manny.
- Oh, no, huh? Oh.

456
00:50:33,577 --> 00:50:37,330
You almost got me killed the other night.
Dead-you understand?

457
00:50:37,455 --> 00:50:42,168
Oh, hey, babe. I didn't have nothin'
to do with that. That was an accident.

458
00:50:42,294 --> 00:50:45,380
- What happened to you?
- What do you mean?

459
00:50:45,505 --> 00:50:49,092
I took off as soon as I saw
that kid jump into the creek.

460
00:50:49,217 --> 00:50:53,263
He did a helluva lot better job
than I coulda ever done.

461
00:50:53,388 --> 00:50:59,978
You know, I don't know if I ever told you
this before but... I can't even swim, babe.

462
00:53:44,935 --> 00:53:46,978
Great.

463
00:54:46,329 --> 00:54:50,375
Terry, do you know how many conspiracy
nuts I've already had in here today?

464
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:51,501
No.

465
00:54:51,626 --> 00:54:56,631
If I had a fuckin' dime for every one of 'em
I'd buy all of Florida and retire in peace.

466
00:54:56,756 --> 00:54:59,718
It's very clear in these photos.
The flash and the smoke.

467
00:54:59,843 --> 00:55:04,723
It could be a lot of things. Why the fuck
does everything have to be a conspiracy?

468
00:55:04,848 --> 00:55:09,269
A man has a couple too many drinks,
he drives off the road, falls into a creek.

469
00:55:09,394 --> 00:55:12,856
- Accident, plain and simple.
- It was not an accident.

470
00:55:12,981 --> 00:55:16,192
I was there. That tyre was shot out.
I heard it. I recorded it.

471
00:55:16,318 --> 00:55:20,572
So you're an earwitness
to an assassination. It's got a nice ring.

472
00:55:20,697 --> 00:55:24,242
- Are you heading up the investigation?
- Yeah.

473
00:55:24,367 --> 00:55:27,704
- Did you check McRyan's tyre?
- No. Why should I?

474
00:55:27,829 --> 00:55:29,915
It has a bullet hole. He was killed.

475
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:33,126
- Says you. Everybody else says accident.
- Who?

476
00:55:33,251 --> 00:55:37,255
I got a special commission formin' here
that's gonna say it was an accident.

477
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:38,882
That's gonna say it was?

478
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:43,261
They have no evidence! They don't have
the tape, the tyre, they didn't speak to me.

479
00:55:43,386 --> 00:55:48,099
I know all about you and your fuckin'
tapes. You put a lotta good cops away.

480
00:55:48,767 --> 00:55:51,353
That has nothin' to do with this,
and I resent it.

481
00:55:51,478 --> 00:55:54,189
I think you stink.
That's what it's got to do with it.

482
00:55:54,314 --> 00:55:58,526
Hey, you. Just because I don't like you
does not mean I'm not gonna do my job.

483
00:55:58,652 --> 00:56:03,490
Now gimme that tape. I'll send it over
to the lab and I'll have it checked out.

484
00:56:03,615 --> 00:56:07,869
I want you to look at that film I made from
those photos. I think you'll get the idea.

485
00:56:07,994 --> 00:56:11,748
But if we can get Karp's original film,
this gunshot'll be a lot clearer.

486
00:56:11,873 --> 00:56:15,585
Karp is makin' a bundle
sellin' his pictures to magazines.

487
00:56:15,710 --> 00:56:18,255
What makes you think
he'll give 'em to us?

488
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:21,549
- He's got to. It's evidence.
- I can't find him, Terry!

489
00:56:21,675 --> 00:56:25,095
- It's your job, man!
- Don't tell me how to do my goddam job!

490
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:28,515
He could tell us what he was
really doin' with his camera.

491
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,934
Nobody wants to know. Nobody cares.

492
00:56:31,059 --> 00:56:34,813
No sordid details.
No political assassination. Accident!

493
00:56:34,938 --> 00:56:38,108
This guy's dead. None of this shit's
gonna do him any good now.

494
00:56:38,233 --> 00:56:40,819
This isn't for him! I know he's dead!

495
00:56:40,944 --> 00:56:45,156
Don't you understand? If they can get
away with killing McRyan, who's next?

496
00:56:45,282 --> 00:56:48,201
Who's "they"? First tell me who "they" is.

497
00:56:48,326 --> 00:56:53,832
Is it a communist conspiracy? Or maybe
it's ayatollahs in the street with blowguns.

498
00:56:53,957 --> 00:56:57,127
- Oh, give me a break.
- Save your paranoia for public TV.

499
00:56:57,252 --> 00:56:58,837
Fuck you. I'm leaving.

500
00:56:58,962 --> 00:57:04,426
Put those pictures down, or I'll have you
arrested for withholding evidence.

501
00:57:04,551 --> 00:57:06,386
Is that right?

502
00:57:06,511 --> 00:57:10,390
All right. I'll be at the office all day.
You can get me there.

503
00:57:10,515 --> 00:57:12,225
I'll call you. Don't call me.

504
00:57:20,108 --> 00:57:22,152
- It's Burke, sir.
- What?

505
00:57:23,194 --> 00:57:25,030
It's Burke, sir.

506
00:57:25,155 --> 00:57:29,284
- Burke! What have you done?
- I don't understand the question, sir.

507
00:57:29,409 --> 00:57:32,829
Are you crazy? You were just
supposed to get some pictures of him.

508
00:57:32,954 --> 00:57:35,415
Are you aware of what you're saying, sir?

509
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:36,541
Where are you?

510
00:57:36,666 --> 00:57:40,837
I'm calling from a secure phone booth.
I suggest you call me back on same.

511
00:58:07,948 --> 00:58:09,991
Excuse me. Is Mr Karp in?

512
00:58:10,575 --> 00:58:12,244
- Could I go in?
- What for?

513
00:58:12,369 --> 00:58:15,288
- I just have to pick up some pictures.
- Are you anybody?

514
00:58:15,413 --> 00:58:19,834
- I'm one of his customers.
- You know, he had a lotta customers.

515
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:21,795
- You're a reporter, ain't ya?
- No.

516
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:25,215
- You want Karp's film.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

517
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:29,511
If there was a law against lyin', I'd have
made a lotta collars today - Mr Customer.

518
00:58:29,636 --> 00:58:34,099
- I am a customer and I'd like my pictures.
- Yeah, he's a customer too.

519
00:58:34,224 --> 00:58:36,893
- He offered me a thousand bucks.
- Really?

520
00:58:37,018 --> 00:58:39,563
And his wife offered me three.

521
00:58:39,688 --> 00:58:42,691
Doesn't seem worth it
but I guess you had to be there, huh?

522
00:58:42,816 --> 00:58:45,986
Looks like Karp did
a little divorce work on the side.

523
00:58:46,111 --> 00:58:50,699
Didn't give a shit about his customers.
I found these in a heap under his bed.

524
00:58:50,824 --> 00:58:52,242
That's some baby picture.

525
00:58:52,909 --> 00:58:55,954
You were supposed to get pictures
of McRyan, not kill him!

526
00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:59,457
I understood
the objectives of the operation.

527
00:58:59,583 --> 00:59:01,876
I didn't kill him. It was an accident.

528
00:59:02,002 --> 00:59:05,255
You accidentally
shot out the tyre of his car?

529
00:59:05,589 --> 00:59:09,593
As you may recall, this was my plan
as proposed at our meeting of June 6.

530
00:59:09,718 --> 00:59:12,470
We rejected that plan.
Don't you remember?

531
00:59:12,596 --> 00:59:15,724
I do admit I had to exceed
the parameters of my authority.

532
00:59:15,849 --> 00:59:18,602
But I stayed within
an acceptable margin of error.

533
00:59:18,727 --> 00:59:22,898
After all, the objective was achieved.
He was eliminated from the election.

534
00:59:23,231 --> 00:59:27,986
Burke, I don't know you.
I've never seen you.

535
00:59:28,111 --> 00:59:32,032
- Don't ever call me again!
- Just a minute. We got some loose ends.

536
00:59:32,741 --> 00:59:35,160
I changed the tyre
so it looked like a blowout.

537
00:59:35,285 --> 00:59:38,663
I erased the sound guy's tapes
so he'll seem like a crackpot.

538
00:59:38,788 --> 00:59:41,041
Karp's disappeared, but I'll find him.

539
00:59:41,166 --> 00:59:43,585
But that still leaves the girl.

540
00:59:43,710 --> 00:59:48,506
I've decided to terminate her and make it
look like one of a series of sex killings.

541
00:59:48,632 --> 00:59:52,260
- This would secure our operation.
- What operation?!

542
00:59:57,307 --> 00:59:59,893
Come on, Betty. Try again.

543
01:00:01,269 --> 01:00:03,313
Take 28.

544
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:08,485
- Cut!

545
01:00:08,610 --> 01:00:11,321
- Cut!
- Speak into the mike. They can't hear.

546
01:00:11,446 --> 01:00:13,490
Oh, Christ. Cut!

547
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:18,161
All right, uh... switch.

548
01:00:18,787 --> 01:00:21,539
Betty, you pull the hair. Jean, you scream.

549
01:00:22,499 --> 01:00:24,417
Take 29.

550
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:39,766
- Sam! I'll be in my room.
- Hey! Where the fuck have you been?

551
01:00:39,891 --> 01:00:42,185
I had some business to take care of.

552
01:00:42,310 --> 01:00:43,812
Shut up!

553
01:00:43,937 --> 01:00:47,148
- I thought you were workin' for me.
- I am. What's the problem?

554
01:00:47,274 --> 01:00:50,777
- We need the effects for the other reel.
- Fine. I'll get 'em.

555
01:00:50,902 --> 01:00:53,738
I haven't even got the scream
for the first reel!

556
01:00:53,863 --> 01:00:55,365
Yes!

557
01:02:47,769 --> 01:02:50,438
Why don't you answer your phone?
It's the police.

558
01:02:50,564 --> 01:02:52,857
- Who's been in here today?
- Some guy...

559
01:02:52,983 --> 01:02:56,278
- What guy?!
- I don't think I like your tone of voice.

560
01:03:01,199 --> 01:03:03,243
- Yes?
- What is wrong with you?

561
01:03:03,368 --> 01:03:06,997
- What?
- Your fuckin' tape had nothin' on it.

562
01:03:07,122 --> 01:03:08,873
All my tapes are blank.

563
01:03:08,999 --> 01:03:12,711
I don't get you. First you feed me
all this nutty assassination shit.

564
01:03:12,836 --> 01:03:14,879
Then you give me a blank tape. What for?

565
01:03:15,005 --> 01:03:18,091
Because somebody erased it!
They've erased all my tapes!

566
01:03:18,216 --> 01:03:21,428
Oh. Oh, yeah. "They" -
they erased your tapes.

567
01:03:21,553 --> 01:03:25,849
Are they gonna be tryin' to kill you next?
You're fuckin' nuts.

568
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:34,274
Sally? It's Jack.

569
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:38,111
Listen to me. I have to show you
that film that I made.

570
01:03:38,236 --> 01:03:40,906
So just stay there. I'm coming right over.

571
01:03:50,373 --> 01:03:53,335
- Is Jack Terry here?
- Sure.

572
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:55,837
- Frank Donahue. Channel...
- Debby.

573
01:03:55,962 --> 01:03:59,966
- There he is now.
- Jack! How are you? I'm Frank Donahue.

574
01:04:00,717 --> 01:04:03,553
- Eye on the City News.
- Oh, yes. Yes.

575
01:04:03,678 --> 01:04:06,014
- Could I talk to you?
- No. Not right now.

576
01:04:06,139 --> 01:04:10,560
Come on. Two minutes. That's all I need.
I came all the way here. Two minutes.

577
01:04:10,685 --> 01:04:13,563
- What do you wanna talk about?
- It's sort of private.

578
01:04:13,688 --> 01:04:15,732
Can we go back here and talk?

579
01:04:15,857 --> 01:04:17,901
- Uh... yeah.
- Great, great.

580
01:04:19,319 --> 01:04:23,949
So you make movies here, huh? I think
I'm a frustrated actor myself, Jack.

581
01:04:24,074 --> 01:04:26,117
What do you want?

582
01:04:26,868 --> 01:04:30,288
You told the police that someone
shot out the tyre on McRyan's car.

583
01:04:30,413 --> 01:04:33,833
- Who told you that? Who told you?
- Jack, that's not important.

584
01:04:33,959 --> 01:04:36,962
I'm a reporter. I've got my sources.

585
01:04:37,087 --> 01:04:41,466
Why would a guy like you be interested in
some kind of assassination nut like me?

586
01:04:41,591 --> 01:04:43,635
Jack, I don't think...

587
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:47,389
- Can we talk in here?
- No. No, no, no. Over here.

588
01:04:51,601 --> 01:04:53,645
What do you mean, a nut?

589
01:04:53,770 --> 01:04:56,565
I don't think you're a nut.
That's why I'm here.

590
01:04:56,690 --> 01:05:00,402
I've looked into this thing,
and a helluva lot of things don't add up

591
01:05:00,527 --> 01:05:04,239
about this... what are the cops
calling it-a freak accident?

592
01:05:04,364 --> 01:05:08,702
I mean, that girl-everyone's pretending
she wasn't in the car. You saw her.

593
01:05:08,868 --> 01:05:10,829
What else did your source say?

594
01:05:10,954 --> 01:05:15,417
Well, among other things,
that you recorded that gunshot.

595
01:05:15,542 --> 01:05:18,128
Great work, Jack.
I'd sure like to hear the tape.

596
01:05:18,253 --> 01:05:22,799
- I could've made it in a recording studio.
- Well, you could have but...

597
01:05:24,467 --> 01:05:26,219
I don't think you did.

598
01:05:26,344 --> 01:05:30,098
I think you got a tape, Jack,
and I think it's the real thing.

599
01:05:30,891 --> 01:05:35,270
Let me put you on the air. Tell everybody
what you saw that night, what you heard.

600
01:05:35,395 --> 01:05:40,775
And then-boom! We play that tape.
It's a great story. What do you think?

601
01:05:40,901 --> 01:05:45,363
- It's bullshit. Nobody'd believe it.
- Hey! Frank Donahue believes it.

602
01:05:45,488 --> 01:05:49,993
And he's got eight million people
every night that watch him.

603
01:05:50,118 --> 01:05:53,204
Go along with me. I guarantee you,
by 8.30 tomorrow night,

604
01:05:53,330 --> 01:05:58,251
every one of those eight million sons of
bitches will believe Jack Terry's story.

605
01:06:36,998 --> 01:06:40,460
Yeah, that's what I heard.
Just before the tyre blew out.

606
01:06:40,585 --> 01:06:42,754
You're right. It was a shot.

607
01:06:42,879 --> 01:06:46,758
- You took this to the police, huh?
- Yes. I gave them a copy.

608
01:06:46,883 --> 01:06:48,927
They sent it to the lab and it was blank.

609
01:06:49,052 --> 01:06:51,513
- So somebody's erased it.
- Are you sure?

610
01:06:51,638 --> 01:06:56,309
I transferred it myself, I played it back and
now it's blank, like the rest of my tapes!

611
01:06:56,434 --> 01:07:01,982
OK! Calm down. The sound is very clear.
It's the picture that's a little fuzzy.

612
01:07:02,107 --> 01:07:05,485
Shit. They'd say I made it up in the lab,
and they'd be right.

613
01:07:05,610 --> 01:07:09,739
Whoever's in on this has contacts with
the police. They want McRyan to vanish.

614
01:07:09,864 --> 01:07:12,576
They don't wanna hear about my gunshot.

615
01:07:12,701 --> 01:07:14,786
- Gee, what are you gonna do?
- What?

616
01:07:14,911 --> 01:07:18,206
- What are you gonna do?
- You mean, what are we gonna do?

617
01:07:18,331 --> 01:07:21,126
- What do I have to do with this?
- Cut the shit, Sally.

618
01:07:21,251 --> 01:07:25,046
- I know what you were doin' in that car.
- What do you know?

619
01:07:25,171 --> 01:07:27,757
You and Karp were settin' up
McRyan for blackmail,

620
01:07:27,882 --> 01:07:31,595
gettin' scummy pictures of him
gettin' laid after the Liberty Ball.

621
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:35,098
You tell him running water
under a well-lit bridge gets you hot?

622
01:07:35,223 --> 01:07:39,352
- Who told you that?
- I saw your motel candid-camera shots.

623
01:07:39,477 --> 01:07:42,647
You got nice tits. Who was paying you
to flash 'em for McRyan?

624
01:07:42,772 --> 01:07:45,358
I wasn't in the car.
Or haven't you read the papers?

625
01:07:45,483 --> 01:07:49,821
Henry's cover-up won't last. I just talked
to a reporter who knows everything.

626
01:07:49,946 --> 01:07:54,159
They have erased my tapes, they've made
you disappear, and next it's gonna be me.

627
01:07:54,284 --> 01:07:56,870
- But I'm not disappearin'.
- Yeah? I am.

628
01:07:56,995 --> 01:07:59,497
- It could be permanent.
- What do you mean?

629
01:07:59,623 --> 01:08:03,043
- We did meet in a car wreck under water.
- But that was an accident.

630
01:08:03,168 --> 01:08:06,296
- Manny wouldn't get me hurt.
- Didn't he get you into the car?

631
01:08:06,421 --> 01:08:10,759
- Yeah, but he didn't know...
- He didn't know the tyre'd be shot out.

632
01:08:12,886 --> 01:08:14,930
- He couldn't have.
- Come on, Sally!

633
01:08:15,055 --> 01:08:20,018
If I hadn't been there to pull you out of the
river, you'd be dead now! Don't you get it?

634
01:08:23,813 --> 01:08:26,566
Sit down. Come on.
I wanna hear everything.

635
01:08:26,691 --> 01:08:29,527
Just start right from the top. Come on.

636
01:08:29,653 --> 01:08:34,532
It was just a job, like all the others. I'd get
'em into bed and Manny'd get it on film.

637
01:08:34,658 --> 01:08:36,243
Them. Who's "them"?

638
01:08:36,368 --> 01:08:39,454
Husbands, city officials,
mostly small-town guys.

639
01:08:39,579 --> 01:08:41,623
Why?

640
01:08:42,832 --> 01:08:46,086
- The money.
- Oh, you need the money that bad?

641
01:08:46,211 --> 01:08:48,004
Come on. You know where I work.

642
01:08:48,129 --> 01:08:53,134
I get paid to smile my ass off and show
the 27 different lipsticks they're pushin'.

643
01:08:53,260 --> 01:08:56,555
You know how much I make?
Shit is what I make. And I can't type.

644
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:59,808
So it doesn't leave
a helluva lot, you know?

645
01:08:59,933 --> 01:09:01,768
So I did it.

646
01:09:01,893 --> 01:09:04,938
I didn't really have to
do anything like screw 'em.

647
01:09:05,063 --> 01:09:08,149
- Just make it embarrassing. I know.
- Yeah, right.

648
01:09:08,275 --> 01:09:13,363
Manny said if a guy stuck his hand in the
cookie jar, he deserves to get it cut off.

649
01:09:13,488 --> 01:09:15,824
Can't cheat an honest man, right?

650
01:09:15,949 --> 01:09:19,411
I guess I wanted to believe it.
It just made it easier.

651
01:09:20,996 --> 01:09:25,333
- OK. McRyan. What about him?
- Manny got me into the Liberty Ball.

652
01:09:25,458 --> 01:09:30,046
I went over to McRyan, told him how great
he was, and he was very hot to show me.

653
01:09:30,171 --> 01:09:33,258
So we slipped out the back
and took off in his car.

654
01:09:33,383 --> 01:09:37,387
- Who hired Manny to take these pictures?
- I don't know.

655
01:09:37,512 --> 01:09:41,766
Don't you think Manny knew that his
client was planning to shoot out the tyre?

656
01:09:41,892 --> 01:09:42,893
No.

657
01:09:43,018 --> 01:09:46,897
- It wouldn't pay to tell you, would it?
- Manny wouldn't do that.

658
01:09:47,022 --> 01:09:49,608
- Didn't he wanna make an extra buck?
- Yeah.

659
01:09:49,733 --> 01:09:52,694
Cos he's makin' big bucks now.
What's your cut?

660
01:09:52,819 --> 01:09:55,322
- I got paid.
- Underpaid, probably.

661
01:09:55,447 --> 01:09:58,783
- What do you care?
- I'm sick of bein' fucked by these guys!

662
01:09:58,909 --> 01:10:03,121
First Henry gets me to shut up to preserve
the reputation of the great governor.

663
01:10:03,246 --> 01:10:07,459
Then I find instead of gettin' laid he gets
murdered, and nobody wants to know.

664
01:10:07,584 --> 01:10:10,921
Nobody wants to know about conspiracy!
I don't get it!

665
01:10:11,296 --> 01:10:14,633
Let me tell you somethin'.
I know what I heard and what I saw.

666
01:10:14,758 --> 01:10:18,345
I'll make sure everyone in this
fuckin' country hears and sees it too.

667
01:10:18,470 --> 01:10:23,225
And you're gonna help me. You find
your pal Karp and get that original film.

668
01:10:23,350 --> 01:10:25,435
This isn't any good. I need the original.

669
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:29,940
Cos if we don't get this on television for
everybody to see, they'll close the book.

670
01:10:30,065 --> 01:10:33,860
And any loose ends, like you or me,
are gonna be cut right off.

671
01:10:33,985 --> 01:10:37,155
You got your choice:
you can be crazy or dead. Either will do.

672
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:42,327
All right. I'll try and get the film. Then will
you just leave me alone about all this?

673
01:10:42,452 --> 01:10:45,163
I wish I was the only one
you had to worry about!

674
01:10:45,288 --> 01:10:48,959
- You're doin' a good job of scarin' me.
- I'm tryin' to save our asses!

675
01:10:49,084 --> 01:10:51,461
I'll look after my own ass, thank you.

676
01:11:11,231 --> 01:11:14,943
- Things aren't adding up, Manny.
- Yeah? Like what?

677
01:11:15,068 --> 01:11:17,279
- There you go.
- How did I end up in that car?

678
01:11:17,404 --> 01:11:19,781
Come on, sit down. Have a seat.

679
01:11:19,906 --> 01:11:23,743
How did I end up in that car
in the bottom of the creek?

680
01:11:23,868 --> 01:11:28,623
Listen. The guy's drivin' along
and all of sudden he has a blowout.

681
01:11:28,748 --> 01:11:32,294
It wasn't a blowout, Manny.
Somebody shot out the tyre.

682
01:11:32,419 --> 01:11:35,255
What are you talkin' about?
How do you know that?

683
01:11:35,380 --> 01:11:38,091
I know. I just know.

684
01:11:38,216 --> 01:11:40,885
- Now, who was it?
- It was nobody.

685
01:11:41,803 --> 01:11:44,347
Come on, Manny. Just level with me.

686
01:11:46,266 --> 01:11:50,645
All right. This nut, he calls me
a couple of weeks ago

687
01:11:50,770 --> 01:11:53,690
and he says he's workin'
for some candidate.

688
01:11:53,815 --> 01:11:58,278
Some candidate that's interested
in gettin' McRyan out of the race.

689
01:11:58,403 --> 01:12:00,447
Sounds like a normal Joe, right?

690
01:12:00,572 --> 01:12:04,409
He says he's heard about our fine
divorce work and offers me six grand.

691
01:12:04,534 --> 01:12:06,995
Six? You told me three.

692
01:12:08,330 --> 01:12:11,207
Yeah, well... three before and three after.

693
01:12:11,333 --> 01:12:14,044
So when were you gonna
tell me about the three after?

694
01:12:14,169 --> 01:12:16,796
After I collected it. When do you think?

695
01:12:18,214 --> 01:12:20,175
Yeah. Sure.

696
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:22,552
Hey. What's the matter with you?

697
01:12:23,345 --> 01:12:26,848
You think I'm pulling your leg?
You don't believe me?

698
01:12:26,973 --> 01:12:31,144
Listen. How was I gonna be sure
that this guy was gonna come through?

699
01:12:31,645 --> 01:12:35,732
I mean, six grand-that's a lotta money
for this kind of a job, huh?

700
01:12:35,857 --> 01:12:39,444
- I'd say he got his money's worth.
- He wasn't supposed to die.

701
01:12:39,569 --> 01:12:43,156
He wasn't even supposed to get hurt.
That was an accident.

702
01:12:43,281 --> 01:12:44,950
I figured it out later.

703
01:12:45,075 --> 01:12:51,081
This nut's idea was to shoot out the tyre
of McRyan's car, cause a little crackup.

704
01:12:51,206 --> 01:12:54,459
- The police come, pull him outta the car...
- With me?

705
01:12:54,584 --> 01:12:57,545
Yeah, yeah, with you.
And I'd get it all on film.

706
01:12:59,714 --> 01:13:01,841
Some little crackup!

707
01:13:01,967 --> 01:13:04,678
He wasn't supposed to die!
That was an accident!

708
01:13:04,803 --> 01:13:07,681
How many times I gotta tell you that?

709
01:13:08,515 --> 01:13:11,101
Manny, we got him killed.

710
01:13:11,226 --> 01:13:13,061
Oh, hey, wait. We?

711
01:13:13,186 --> 01:13:17,357
What do you mean, we, huh?
We didn't do nothin'.

712
01:13:17,482 --> 01:13:21,903
I was in the woods, you were in the car.
I didn't shoot out no tyre. Neither did you.

713
01:13:22,028 --> 01:13:25,782
So, please, don't give me
none of this conscience shit, huh?

714
01:13:28,660 --> 01:13:34,291
Besides, nobody is exactly cryin'
over the way things turned out.

715
01:13:34,833 --> 01:13:37,502
What would've happened
if the guy had lived?

716
01:13:37,627 --> 01:13:40,338
His career was finished, thanks to us.

717
01:13:40,463 --> 01:13:43,758
This way the guy comes out ahead.

718
01:13:43,883 --> 01:13:49,389
He's a saint, a martyr. Christ,
they passed one of his bills this morning.

719
01:13:49,514 --> 01:13:51,725
You're a pig, Manny.

720
01:13:51,850 --> 01:13:56,813
- And I'm a pig too.
- What the hell is with this "pig" shit?

721
01:13:56,938 --> 01:14:02,027
We gotta tell the truth before the books
are closed and the loose ends are cut off.

722
01:14:02,152 --> 01:14:03,737
What are you talkin' about?

723
01:14:03,862 --> 01:14:07,073
McRyan was murdered
and everybody should know that.

724
01:14:07,198 --> 01:14:12,579
Are you crazy? We got him killed.
Do you wanna go to jail?

725
01:14:12,704 --> 01:14:16,291
Yeah, but I was in the car
and you were in the woods.

726
01:14:16,416 --> 01:14:20,003
You think anybody is gonna believe that?

727
01:14:20,128 --> 01:14:22,130
I don't know but I gotta do somethin'.

728
01:14:22,255 --> 01:14:26,009
Yeah, like just keep your mouth shut
and take the money.

729
01:14:26,134 --> 01:14:30,972
Hey, babe! This is the biggest thing
since the Zapruder film.

730
01:14:31,097 --> 01:14:33,141
- I don't care.
- It's bigger!

731
01:14:33,266 --> 01:14:36,269
This is history we got here, girl!

732
01:14:36,394 --> 01:14:38,521
This is gonna be a goddam fortune.

733
01:14:38,647 --> 01:14:42,317
It's gonna be in every newspaper.
It's gonna be in every magazine.

734
01:14:42,442 --> 01:14:45,278
It's gonna be on the fuckin'
six o'clock news.

735
01:14:45,403 --> 01:14:47,989
They're gonna build TV specials
around this thing.

736
01:14:48,114 --> 01:14:51,201
And they're gonna ask
a goddam fortune for it.

737
01:14:51,326 --> 01:14:55,830
Hey. Don't you understand,
sweetheart? We're set.

738
01:14:55,956 --> 01:15:01,044
I don't care. I don't want any part of
this thing. You can keep your three after.

739
01:15:01,836 --> 01:15:04,965
Hey, don't be such a dope, huh?

740
01:15:05,090 --> 01:15:07,133
Money's money.

741
01:15:08,677 --> 01:15:11,972
- We sound like a couple of vultures.

742
01:15:12,097 --> 01:15:16,309
Pigs, vultures... You swallow
a whole box of animal crackers?

743
01:15:19,312 --> 01:15:22,607
I need a drink, Manny.
Come on, give me a drink.

744
01:15:22,732 --> 01:15:26,528
- Yeah, sure I'll get us a drink.
- Just give me the bottle.

745
01:15:31,074 --> 01:15:33,118
Hey, now you're thinkin', babe.

746
01:15:33,660 --> 01:15:39,249
- We'll go over to Atlantic City maybe.
- I don't like Atlantic City.

747
01:15:39,374 --> 01:15:42,127
- No? I'll show you around.
- Stop. Come on.

748
01:15:42,252 --> 01:15:45,171
- We'll have a lot of good times.
- Manny, stop!

749
01:15:45,297 --> 01:15:49,968
- We'll have a lotta laughs.
- Please, Manny, don't. Don't do this.

750
01:15:50,093 --> 01:15:53,179
Manny, please! Please!

751
01:15:53,305 --> 01:15:57,225
- Relax, baby.

752
01:16:35,347 --> 01:16:37,390
- Fantastic! Ah.

753
01:16:37,515 --> 01:16:39,559
- Great.

754
01:16:41,311 --> 01:16:43,855
- Well? Now what?
- You're great.

755
01:16:43,980 --> 01:16:47,442
I'm gonna call that TV guy.
We're gonna get it on the air.

756
01:16:47,567 --> 01:16:50,237
- Can I make you somethin' to eat?
- Yeah, fine.

757
01:16:50,362 --> 01:16:52,948
- How about some cornflakes?
- Anything.

758
01:16:57,202 --> 01:17:00,247
Frank Donahue, please. It's Jack Terry.

759
01:17:00,372 --> 01:17:04,125
- Yeah?
- Jack Terry calling.

760
01:17:04,251 --> 01:17:06,628
- Mr Donahue?
- Jack. Yeah.

761
01:17:06,753 --> 01:17:09,506
I've changed my mind.
I want you to hear that tape.

762
01:17:09,631 --> 01:17:14,594
I've also got Karp's film. If you run 'em
together, it's clear it wasn't an accident.

763
01:17:14,719 --> 01:17:19,349
That's great, Jack. Look, I can't talk now.
Can I get back to you in 20 minutes?

764
01:17:20,642 --> 01:17:23,562
I don't know why.

765
01:17:23,687 --> 01:17:25,730
She wanted me to do it.

766
01:17:26,106 --> 01:17:30,652
She asked for it.
She begged me for it, the bitch!

767
01:17:30,777 --> 01:17:33,989
I... I didn't wanna do it.

768
01:17:34,114 --> 01:17:37,450
She made me do it.

769
01:17:37,576 --> 01:17:40,245
You ask her. She'll tell you.

770
01:17:40,370 --> 01:17:44,040
- OK. Where is she?
- I don't know. Somewhere.

771
01:17:45,125 --> 01:17:50,297
In that big hole, near the Reading Market,
where they're buildin' somethin'.

772
01:17:51,464 --> 01:17:54,467
But don't listen to her. She made me do it!

773
01:17:54,593 --> 01:17:56,636
OK. Just tell me where you are.

774
01:17:58,054 --> 01:17:59,472
Where...

775
01:18:00,140 --> 01:18:04,561
Listen, Jack. You realise this won't mean
a thing unless you come on the air

776
01:18:04,686 --> 01:18:06,897
and you say it's what you saw and heard?

777
01:18:07,022 --> 01:18:10,400
- I'll say it's what I heard.
- OK. That's great.

778
01:18:10,525 --> 01:18:14,446
Jack, what about that girl? She must
have heard it. Can we get her on?

779
01:18:14,571 --> 01:18:17,032
No. She did, but don't involve her, OK?

780
01:18:17,157 --> 01:18:21,661
- Why not?
- She's not exactly proud of what she did.

781
01:18:21,786 --> 01:18:25,457
OK. No problem, Jack.
But could I at least talk to her?

782
01:18:25,582 --> 01:18:30,045
- Well, that's up to her. I...
- OK. Look, I'll take care of that.

783
01:18:30,170 --> 01:18:32,672
Jack, could you hold on just one second?

784
01:18:35,508 --> 01:18:39,054
- Jack, when can I see this stuff?
- Uh, any time.

785
01:18:39,179 --> 01:18:42,766
Great. Can I give you a call
this afternoon? Where can I reach you?

786
01:18:42,891 --> 01:18:46,353
- I'll be home all day.
- OK. I'll call you then. So long.

787
01:18:47,270 --> 01:18:49,648
- Oh, hi.
- I just spoke to Donahue.

788
01:18:49,773 --> 01:18:53,151
- Who's he?
- A TV newsman. Does investigative news.

789
01:18:53,276 --> 01:18:55,487
Oh, I don't watch the news.

790
01:18:55,612 --> 01:18:57,489
- What?

791
01:18:57,614 --> 01:19:00,408
- What's he wanna do?
- He said he'd put it on the air.

792
01:19:00,533 --> 01:19:02,994
- He'd call later and set up a meeting.
- Great.

793
01:19:03,119 --> 01:19:06,873
He also said he'd like me to go on TV
and say that it's what I saw and heard.

794
01:19:06,998 --> 01:19:09,376
Said the tape wouldn't be
any good without it.

795
01:19:09,501 --> 01:19:14,422
- But he'd also like you to go on too.
- Oh, no. I don't want any part of it.

796
01:19:14,547 --> 01:19:17,926
Well, I know you don't,
but would you at least speak to him?

797
01:19:18,051 --> 01:19:20,303
No, I don't want to.

798
01:19:20,428 --> 01:19:23,431
Come on, Sally. They can't say
we're both hearing things.

799
01:19:23,557 --> 01:19:27,185
If we get this out in the open,
there's no one that can hurt us.

800
01:19:27,310 --> 01:19:29,354
All right, I'll think about it, OK?

801
01:19:29,771 --> 01:19:34,859
At City Hall this morning, Chief Inspector
Mackey held a news conference.

802
01:19:34,985 --> 01:19:38,488
He said a preliminary investigation
into Governor McRyan's death

803
01:19:38,613 --> 01:19:41,324
revealed that he was the victim
of a freak accident.

804
01:19:41,449 --> 01:19:42,951
- Bullshit!
- Also in the news

805
01:19:43,076 --> 01:19:45,370
is the bizarre sex killing of Mary Robert,

806
01:19:45,495 --> 01:19:48,957
a 22-year-old receptionist
from the Center City area.

807
01:19:49,082 --> 01:19:53,003
Her body was found at 1 0am
in the Reading Terminal excavation site

808
01:19:53,128 --> 01:19:55,964
after police received a tip
from an anonymous caller.

809
01:20:09,728 --> 01:20:11,354
The girl had been strangled,

810
01:20:11,479 --> 01:20:15,692
then repeatedly stabbed with a pointed
instrument across her stomach and groin.

811
01:20:15,817 --> 01:20:18,945
The stab marks were
in the pattern of a Liberty Bell.

812
01:20:19,070 --> 01:20:22,782
The police are at a loss
to explain this grotesque mutilation.

813
01:20:22,908 --> 01:20:25,327
We asked forensic psychologist
Dr Joseph Fuchs

814
01:20:25,452 --> 01:20:28,997
what connection there might be
between the bell-shaped wounds

815
01:20:29,122 --> 01:20:31,416
and the upcoming
Liberty Day celebration.

816
01:20:31,541 --> 01:20:34,461
- Hi. This is Sally.
- Hi, Sally. Frank Donahue here.

817
01:20:34,586 --> 01:20:36,963
Yeah, you were supposed to call Jack.

818
01:20:37,088 --> 01:20:41,301
It's the damnedest thing. I can't get Jack
on the phone to arrange a meeting.

819
01:20:41,426 --> 01:20:45,680
His line's been busy
all day. So I thought I'd give you a ring.

820
01:20:46,890 --> 01:20:47,933
Yeah? So?

821
01:21:06,368 --> 01:21:09,996
Something's wrong with your phone.
I kept gettin' a busy signal.

822
01:21:10,121 --> 01:21:13,083
What do you mean?
I've been waitin' for Donahue's call.

823
01:21:13,208 --> 01:21:16,962
- He was gettin' a busy signal too.
- How do you know that?

824
01:21:17,087 --> 01:21:20,131
He called me. We're meeting
at 30th Street Station at five.

825
01:21:20,257 --> 01:21:21,675
How did he get your number?

826
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:23,760
- Didn't you give it to him?
- No.

827
01:21:23,885 --> 01:21:26,638
Well, reporters have a way
of gettin' numbers.

828
01:21:26,763 --> 01:21:31,935
- So I'll give him the tape and the film.
- Why didn't he call me back?

829
01:21:32,686 --> 01:21:35,605
He wants to meet me alone,
to talk me into goin' on the air.

830
01:21:35,730 --> 01:21:37,816
No, he should've called me back.

831
01:21:37,941 --> 01:21:40,819
- Your phone is out of order.
- It is not out of order.

832
01:21:40,944 --> 01:21:43,613
I've been here all day.
I made a phone call.

833
01:21:43,738 --> 01:21:45,865
- Here. Listen.

834
01:21:46,575 --> 01:21:49,995
- Maybe the phone company's in on it.
- No, something's not right.

835
01:21:50,120 --> 01:21:54,374
Let's just meet him. I'll give him the tape
and the film and get it over with.

836
01:21:54,499 --> 01:21:56,835
Once he's got the film, that's it!

837
01:21:58,878 --> 01:22:01,840
All right. He wants to meet you, right?

838
01:22:01,965 --> 01:22:04,426
- Yeah.
- OK. You're gonna go and meet him.

839
01:22:04,551 --> 01:22:07,220
If he sounds OK,
you'll give him the film and tape.

840
01:22:07,345 --> 01:22:09,723
- Where are you gonna be?
- Close.

841
01:22:09,848 --> 01:22:12,601
- I don't get it.
- I'm gonna wire you.

842
01:22:13,059 --> 01:22:14,853
Wire me? What for?

843
01:22:14,978 --> 01:22:19,107
I'm gonna cover all the bases.
Nobody's gonna fuck me this time.

844
01:22:21,151 --> 01:22:25,322
This way, if he disappears with the film,
he can't deny it cos I got him on tape.

845
01:22:25,447 --> 01:22:28,283
Aren't you gettin' a little paranoid here?

846
01:22:28,408 --> 01:22:32,287
He's a newsman. This is a very big story.
Why isn't he gonna put it on the air?

847
01:22:32,412 --> 01:22:36,708
Look what happened when I took it
to the police. They erased it, right?

848
01:22:36,833 --> 01:22:40,003
- What are you doin'?
- Making a copy, to cover ourselves.

849
01:22:40,128 --> 01:22:42,964
Yeah? Well, what about the film?

850
01:22:43,089 --> 01:22:46,176
I can't make a copy now!
I don't have time to do that!

851
01:22:46,301 --> 01:22:49,095
- OK, OK. Bring on the wire.
- Take off your coat.

852
01:22:49,221 --> 01:22:50,513
OK. Let's get it over with.

853
01:23:05,904 --> 01:23:10,158
- So you travel a lot, huh?
- Oh, yeah. I been all over the place.

854
01:23:10,283 --> 01:23:12,244
Yeah, I travelled once.

855
01:23:12,369 --> 01:23:17,123
So, uh... you say you got
about 60 minutes and about 60 dollars?

856
01:23:17,249 --> 01:23:19,793
- Oh, no. Did I say that?
- Yeah, you did say that.

857
01:23:19,918 --> 01:23:24,631
No, I think... about 20 minutes
and about 20 dollars is what I've got.

858
01:23:24,756 --> 01:23:28,593
Gee, it's too bad you don't have
about 40 minutes and about 40 dollars.

859
01:23:28,718 --> 01:23:31,513
- Yeah, that's too bad.
- Yeah, that's too bad.

860
01:23:32,055 --> 01:23:35,517
What I've got is about 20 minutes
and about 20 dollars.

861
01:23:35,642 --> 01:23:38,895
- The trains are never on time.

862
01:23:39,020 --> 01:23:41,273
They're notorious. Know what I mean?

863
01:23:41,398 --> 01:23:44,276
I bet you at least got 30 minutes. At least.

864
01:23:44,401 --> 01:23:47,904
- Do I have to have 30 minutes?
- At least 30 minutes.

865
01:23:48,029 --> 01:23:53,243
You know, I believe I do have
about 30 minutes and about 30 dollars.

866
01:23:53,702 --> 01:23:56,413
Great. I'll make a quick phone call

867
01:23:56,538 --> 01:23:59,624
and meet you in the back
of the waiting room in two minutes.

868
01:23:59,749 --> 01:24:04,212
That should be two dollars off but... we'll
let you go this time. Know what I mean?

869
01:24:04,337 --> 01:24:07,382
No, I don't know what you mean.
You know what I mean?

870
01:24:07,507 --> 01:24:10,302
- See ya.
- Yeah. I know what you mean.

871
01:24:14,389 --> 01:24:16,433
Hey, Ralphie!

872
01:24:19,477 --> 01:24:21,521
I gotta have a 20.

873
01:24:27,485 --> 01:24:31,990
Just enjoy your puppet show.
Have a good Liberty Day.

874
01:25:27,963 --> 01:25:32,217
- Slower! Aw, shit!
- Some hotshot sailor you are!

875
01:25:32,342 --> 01:25:36,555
That's ridiculous! Why don't you grow up
and learn a thing or two, sailor boy?

876
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:39,766
I've been on a sh...
Ten for you, baby! Ten!

877
01:25:40,642 --> 01:25:45,272
- Hey, what about my $30? You fuck.
- You blew it! You know what I mean?

878
01:25:47,148 --> 01:25:49,192
Shit.

879
01:28:23,138 --> 01:28:27,142
Attention, please.
This will be the last call

880
01:28:27,267 --> 01:28:32,439
for the Broadway Limited
to Pittsburgh and Chicago.

881
01:28:33,481 --> 01:28:38,320
All passengers travelling
all the way to Chicago,

882
01:28:38,445 --> 01:28:42,866
and passengers holding space
in car 4 1 40...

883
01:29:01,593 --> 01:29:05,597
- Aren't you overdoin' this a little bit?
- We've got nothin' to lose.

884
01:29:05,722 --> 01:29:09,935
If I had any sense, I'd take this stuff
and dump it in the trash, and that'd be it.

885
01:29:10,060 --> 01:29:13,897
- Yeah, but I got the original at home, so...
- So why all this?

886
01:29:14,022 --> 01:29:17,525
Because of Manny's film. I told you.
We gotta be careful with it.

887
01:29:17,651 --> 01:29:22,280
You know, the only real trouble
I ever got into was when I was too careful.

888
01:29:26,034 --> 01:29:28,119
Give me a sound level. Count to 10, slow.

889
01:29:28,245 --> 01:29:30,372
- One two three four...
- No, just normal.

890
01:29:30,497 --> 01:29:33,583
One two three four five
six seven eight nine ten.

891
01:29:33,708 --> 01:29:36,670
- All right.
- Come on. We gotta get goin' here.

892
01:29:36,795 --> 01:29:39,339
- Look, don't forget you got this on, OK?
- OK.

893
01:29:39,464 --> 01:29:41,841
If you need me, talk to me. It's right there.

894
01:29:41,967 --> 01:29:44,010
OK. Affirmative.

895
01:29:46,888 --> 01:29:48,932
- Sally, come here.
- What?

896
01:29:49,641 --> 01:29:51,476
Thank you.

897
01:29:57,065 --> 01:29:59,109
Over and out.

898
01:30:54,039 --> 01:30:56,207
Hello, Jack? Can you hear me?

899
01:30:56,333 --> 01:31:01,087
Like I was saying before about goin'
to New York. We could see some shows.

900
01:31:01,213 --> 01:31:06,134
You know, like Sugar Babies. And I know
a great hotel in the Times Square area...

901
01:31:06,259 --> 01:31:07,802
Sally?

902
01:31:07,928 --> 01:31:11,264
- Hi. I'm Frank Donahue.
- Oh, hi. Nice to meet you.

903
01:31:11,389 --> 01:31:14,100
Would you mind
walking with me for a moment?

904
01:31:14,226 --> 01:31:15,769
Where are we goin'?

905
01:31:15,894 --> 01:31:18,730
- I think we got a little problem.
- What's that?

906
01:31:18,855 --> 01:31:20,899
It sounds crazy but...

907
01:31:21,900 --> 01:31:25,237
I think we're being followed.
Yeah. No problem.

908
01:31:51,972 --> 01:31:54,057
Gee, you're a fast walker.

909
01:31:54,683 --> 01:31:57,686
Well, in my business
you gotta be fast on your feet.

910
01:31:57,811 --> 01:32:01,314
- Where's Jack?
- Uh... Oh, he's at home, resting.

911
01:32:01,439 --> 01:32:04,568
- The pressure can get to you.
- Which train are we takin'?

912
01:32:04,693 --> 01:32:09,030
- I don't know yet. Got the tape and film?
- Yeah, right here in my bag.

913
01:32:24,546 --> 01:32:28,758
- I guess we lost him, huh?
- Well, we can't be too careful.

914
01:32:28,884 --> 01:32:34,639
Tell you what. Walk slowly down to the
end of the platform right in front of me.

915
01:32:34,764 --> 01:32:38,184
I don't know why you think
anyone'd wanna follow us anyway.

916
01:32:38,310 --> 01:32:41,605
You'd be amazed what some people
would do for a story like this.

917
01:32:41,730 --> 01:32:44,149
- Yeah, I guess so.
- No, don't turn around.

918
01:32:44,274 --> 01:32:47,152
- We don't wanna give ourselves away.
- Yeah, right.

919
01:32:47,277 --> 01:32:50,697
Just pretend like
nothing's happened, all right?

920
01:33:01,708 --> 01:33:04,711
Just look at this place!
This is disgusting!

921
01:33:04,836 --> 01:33:08,590
- Yeah. It's a real shame.
- And it's not even safe any more.

922
01:33:08,715 --> 01:33:12,219
It reminds me of that story
about that guy in New York. Remember?

923
01:33:12,344 --> 01:33:16,473
- Yeah, I think we did a piece on him.
- He'd ride the subways at rush hour.

924
01:33:16,598 --> 01:33:20,185
He'd stand in the corner real quiet
so's nobody'd notice him.

925
01:33:20,310 --> 01:33:25,023
Then they'd pull in to a station, he'd open
his coat and pull out a big meat cleaver,

926
01:33:25,148 --> 01:33:26,983
and whack 'em right over the head.

927
01:33:27,108 --> 01:33:31,071
- Let's go, Sally.
- And then they had this transit strike.

928
01:33:31,196 --> 01:33:34,950
He just disappeared.
It was like he went on strike too.

929
01:33:35,075 --> 01:33:36,576
So I don't ride the subways.

930
01:33:36,701 --> 01:33:40,163
It's not safe. I wouldn't even
come down here if it wasn't for you.

931
01:33:44,292 --> 01:33:46,044
Speak up. Come on.

932
01:33:46,169 --> 01:33:51,174
You see what I mean? See that creepy
character? It's just not safe any more.

933
01:33:55,303 --> 01:33:56,638
The train's coming.

934
01:33:56,763 --> 01:33:59,099
- Franklin Bridge Express.

935
01:33:59,224 --> 01:34:00,767
Is that where we're goin'?

936
01:34:00,892 --> 01:34:04,437
- Where? Come on.
- That where they're having the fireworks?

937
01:34:04,563 --> 01:34:07,440
That's right.
They got a nice bar down there.

938
01:34:07,566 --> 01:34:12,320
Why don't we have our drink and
our little chat, then take in the fireworks?

939
01:34:12,445 --> 01:34:13,989
Sure, OK.

940
01:34:14,114 --> 01:34:16,700
- Want to help me cover the story?
- All right.

941
01:34:17,742 --> 01:34:20,579
- You could give us the woman's angle.
- Yeah.

942
01:34:20,954 --> 01:34:22,831
Franklin Bridge Express, huh?

943
01:34:26,167 --> 01:34:27,210
Hey!

944
01:34:33,884 --> 01:34:36,344
Sally! Sally!

945
01:34:37,012 --> 01:34:40,348
- So what's the big deal with Liberty Day?
- Did you see our story?

946
01:34:40,473 --> 01:34:42,601
I don't watch news. It's too depressing.

947
01:36:40,135 --> 01:36:42,178
Somebody get an ambulance!

948
01:36:42,971 --> 01:36:45,015
Try that back door!

949
01:36:59,654 --> 01:37:01,698
Is it 16 or 35?

950
01:37:01,823 --> 01:37:05,619
- What do you mean?
- The gauge of the film.

951
01:37:05,744 --> 01:37:08,872
They've only got 16mm equipment
out at the station.

952
01:37:08,997 --> 01:37:12,167
- I think that's what it is.
- Why don't you let me have a look?

953
01:37:12,292 --> 01:37:14,211
- Oh, sure.
- Come into the light.

954
01:37:26,723 --> 01:37:28,350
Here it is.

955
01:37:28,475 --> 01:37:30,602
- Got the tape too?
- Yeah.

956
01:37:32,479 --> 01:37:34,314
Yeah, that's 16 all right.

957
01:37:41,071 --> 01:37:42,697
Are you... wrappin' it up?

958
01:37:51,539 --> 01:37:53,917
What did you do that for?!

959
01:37:54,834 --> 01:37:56,670
Jack's gonna kill you.

960
01:38:01,299 --> 01:38:03,969
Oh, God, no. No!

961
01:38:13,687 --> 01:38:16,147
One more sound and you're dead.

962
01:38:19,401 --> 01:38:24,948
Come on, Sally. We're gonna
cover the fireworks, remember?

963
01:39:32,432 --> 01:39:34,476
Jack, please!

964
01:39:43,485 --> 01:39:45,862
Jack! Please!

965
01:39:45,987 --> 01:39:47,405
No!

966
01:39:50,700 --> 01:39:53,328
God, Jack!

967
01:42:57,053 --> 01:42:59,222
Hello, Jack? Can you hear me?

968
01:42:59,347 --> 01:43:04,227
Like I was saying before about goin'
to New York. We could see some shows.

969
01:43:04,352 --> 01:43:07,480
You know, like "Sugar Babies".
And I know a great hotel...

970
01:43:07,606 --> 01:43:12,360
Two more young women
were killed by the Liberty Bell Strangler.

971
01:43:12,485 --> 01:43:16,114
But the tragedy ended when
the final victim, Sally Badina,

972
01:43:16,239 --> 01:43:20,452
killed her attacker in a bloody struggle
on the top of the Port of History building

973
01:43:20,577 --> 01:43:23,288
during the Liberty Day
firework celebration.

974
01:43:23,413 --> 01:43:27,167
The identity of the strangler
has not yet been determined.

975
01:43:27,292 --> 01:43:31,838
Governor McRyan's death continues to
send shock waves throughout the nation.

976
01:43:33,715 --> 01:43:35,383
Oh, Jack!

977
01:43:35,508 --> 01:43:40,138
- Oh, God! Oh, please!

978
01:43:47,187 --> 01:43:49,856
Jack, please!

979
01:43:50,523 --> 01:43:53,985
Oh, God! God, Jack!

980
01:43:57,906 --> 01:43:59,407
Now, that's a scream!

981
01:43:59,532 --> 01:44:01,785
- How was the level?
- More on the scream.

982
01:44:01,910 --> 01:44:04,371
- I don't wanna distort it.
- Come on. Bring it up.

983
01:44:04,496 --> 01:44:09,125
- All right. I'll give it more the next time.
- That's wonderful.

984
01:44:09,251 --> 01:44:13,797
- What'd you think of the rest of the mix?
- Uh, OK. On the beginning...

985
01:44:16,424 --> 01:44:18,468
It's a good scream.

986
01:44:18,760 --> 01:44:20,595
It's a good scream.

987
01:44:20,971 --> 01:44:22,597
It's a good scream.

988
01:44:23,597 --> 01:44:33,597
