00:02:10,898 --> 00:02:13,492
<i>When your father was a boy like you...</i>

3
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:15,893
<i>... living with me here in Norway...</i>

4
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,665
<i>... I told him about witches, too...</i>

5
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:21,000
<i>... so that he would always be aware.</i>

6
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:25,334
<i>The most important thing
youshould know about...</i>

7
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:27,607
<i>... real witches is this.</i>

8
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:29,715
<i>Listen very carefully.</i>

9
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,642
<i>Real witches dress in ordinary clothes...</i>

10
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,188
<i>... and look very much like ordinary women.</i>

11
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,390
They live in ordinary houses...

12
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:41,451
...and they work in ordinary jobs.

13
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:48,468
Every country in the world has witches.

14
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:51,362
And there is a leader...

15
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:54,968
...a high witch of each country.

16
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:56,740
And the ruler...

17
00:02:57,711 --> 00:02:59,508
...of all the witches...

18
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,116
...is the most evil woman in creation.

19
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:07,520
The Grand High Witch herself.

20
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:16,987
Witches spend their time
plotting to kill children.

21
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:20,462
Stalking the wretched child like a hunter...

22
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,502
...stalks a bird in the forest.

23
00:03:23,237 --> 00:03:24,636
Did they hunt you?

24
00:03:30,978 --> 00:03:32,605
You said it was an accident.

25
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:35,807
A very unpleasant accident.

26
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:38,680
When I was younger...

27
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:42,684
...I traveled the world
in search for the Grand High Witch...

28
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:44,485
...but I never found her.

29
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:48,561
I don't really believe
that anyone has ever found her.

30
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:51,393
If no one's seen the Grand High Witch...

31
00:03:51,465 --> 00:03:53,296
...how are you sure she exists?

32
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:57,228
Nobody's ever seen the devil,
but we know he exists, don't we?

33
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:02,000
<i>For all youknow,
a witch might be living next door to you.</i>

34
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:05,477
<i>When I was little...</i>

35
00:04:05,546 --> 00:04:08,242
<i>... I lived beside a girl called Erica...</i>

36
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:10,713
<i>... who was taken by a witch.</i>

37
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:14,212
<i>Erica had very strict parents.</i>

38
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:17,413
<i>But even that didn't save poor Erica...</i>

39
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:20,185
<i>... because when a witch chooses a victim...</i>

40
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,127
<i>... there is only one hope of escape:</i>

41
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:27,491
<i>Knowing everything about them
that I am telling you.</i>

42
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:29,358
<i>I'm warning you!</i>

43
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,033
Erica, come in.

44
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:36,675
<i>What makes her dangerous is the fact
that she doesn't look dangerous.</i>

45
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:40,310
<i>Youcan never be sure
if it's a witch you're looking at...</i>

46
00:04:40,414 --> 00:04:42,109
<i>... or a kind lady.</i>

47
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:47,250
Erica!

48
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:50,618
How do you like my new painting?

49
00:04:50,691 --> 00:04:52,283
<i>It's magnifique, Papa.</i>

50
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,625
Go to Larsen's...

51
00:04:55,362 --> 00:04:57,830
...and buy a liter of milk.

52
00:04:58,365 --> 00:04:59,457
Yes, Papa.

53
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:04,367
Come straight home.

54
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:08,908
<i>Real witches hate children.</i>

55
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,340
Real witches are quite bald.

56
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:18,882
Although, of course, they wear wigs...

57
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:20,514
...that itch...

58
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:23,520
...and cause them scalp rash.

59
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,519
Do you know what scalp rash is?

60
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:26,490
No.

61
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:30,829
Itching under the wig.
Must drive them crazy.

62
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:36,834
They look quite hideous
behind their human facemasks.

63
00:05:37,237 --> 00:05:40,798
<i>They can only be distinguished
from ordinary women...</i>

64
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:45,637
<i>... if youare sharp enough
to spot the purple tinge to their eyes.</i>

65
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:50,772
<i>Real witches have no toes.</i>

66
00:05:51,385 --> 00:05:53,717
<i>Their feet have square ends...</i>

67
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:57,587
<i>... revolting stumps
where their toes should be.</i>

68
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:01,256
<i>So they never wear pointed
or pretty shoes.</i>

69
00:06:01,328 --> 00:06:04,559
<i>Just plain, sensible shoes.</i>

70
00:06:05,332 --> 00:06:08,096
<i>Remember these things.</i>

71
00:06:09,436 --> 00:06:12,303
<i>Perhaps if Erica had known them...</i>

72
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,017
<i>My poor Erica.</i>

73
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:32,181
<i>For weeks they searched.</i>

74
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:36,593
<i>But witches don't murder children
with knives or guns.</i>

75
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:38,824
<i>That's for people who get caught.</i>

76
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:41,798
<i>And witches never get caught.</i>

77
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:45,634
<i>They searched for miles around.</i>

78
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:48,438
<i>Everyone in the town searched...</i>

79
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:52,376
<i>... but she had completely disappeared.</i>

80
00:06:59,553 --> 00:07:03,046
<i>I was there in Erica's house
six weeks later.</i>

81
00:07:03,191 --> 00:07:04,954
<i>Good day, Frau Larsen.</i>

82
00:07:05,026 --> 00:07:07,051
Come in, Helga. Have some cake.

83
00:07:07,328 --> 00:07:09,853
<i>I was her best friend when it happened.</i>

84
00:07:11,365 --> 00:07:12,889
<i>Then, that day...</i>

85
00:07:13,468 --> 00:07:16,494
<i>... while Erica's mother
was pouring the coffee...</i>

86
00:07:16,904 --> 00:07:19,600
<i>... her father came walking towards us.</i>

87
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:23,607
<i>It was as though he had seen a ghost.</i>

88
00:07:23,978 --> 00:07:25,605
<i>His face was all twisted up...</i>

89
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,444
<i>... as he walked towards the painting
behind me.</i>

90
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:33,344
<i>There, as if it always had been there...</i>

91
00:07:33,955 --> 00:07:35,354
<i>... was Erica...</i>

92
00:07:35,656 --> 00:07:37,886
<i>... locked in the painting...</i>

93
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:40,450
<i>... gazing at us.</i>

94
00:07:41,095 --> 00:07:42,824
<i>Papa...</i>

95
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,498
I don't believe it.
You saw her in the painting, Grandma?

96
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:50,161
Many times.

97
00:07:50,338 --> 00:07:53,739
But the peculiar thing
was that little Erica...

98
00:07:53,808 --> 00:07:57,209
...kept changing her position in the picture.

99
00:07:57,745 --> 00:07:59,679
One day she'd be feeding the ducks.

100
00:07:59,747 --> 00:08:02,375
The next day,
she'd be inside the farmhouse...

101
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:04,447
...Iooking out of a window.

102
00:08:04,552 --> 00:08:06,816
Did you see her moving in the picture?

103
00:08:06,921 --> 00:08:08,912
Nobody did.

104
00:08:09,257 --> 00:08:11,987
She was always just a figure...

105
00:08:12,393 --> 00:08:14,588
<i>... motionless in the painting.</i>

106
00:08:16,164 --> 00:08:20,032
<i>As the years went by,
Erica grew older, too.</i>

107
00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:24,466
And only five or six years ago...

108
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:27,303
...the old woman that Erica had become...

109
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:30,344
...bent and frail in the painting...

110
00:08:30,545 --> 00:08:33,480
...began to disappear.

111
00:08:34,215 --> 00:08:35,443
Until...

112
00:08:36,117 --> 00:08:38,608
...one morning, she was gone.

113
00:08:39,687 --> 00:08:40,949
She died?

114
00:08:41,255 --> 00:08:42,347
Who knows?

115
00:08:42,824 --> 00:08:45,952
Mysterious things go on
in the world of witches.

116
00:08:48,462 --> 00:08:50,191
It's almost 9:00.

117
00:08:50,264 --> 00:08:52,630
Grandma's been telling me
about witches, Mom.

118
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,760
And frightening you before you go to sleep.

119
00:08:56,704 --> 00:08:58,171
Good night, darling.

120
00:08:58,239 --> 00:08:59,467
Everything all right?

121
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,837
Very all right.

122
00:09:00,908 --> 00:09:02,398
Go on. Enjoy yourselves.

123
00:09:02,476 --> 00:09:03,738
Good-bye, Mom.

124
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:05,839
Here you go.

125
00:09:07,048 --> 00:09:09,346
- Good night, son.
- Good night, Dad.

126
00:09:09,417 --> 00:09:11,044
No more stories, okay?

127
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:13,609
Oh, no.

128
00:09:39,814 --> 00:09:42,009
Come on, just one more story.

129
00:09:42,617 --> 00:09:45,450
All right, one more. But very short.

130
00:09:47,755 --> 00:09:48,983
Witches...

131
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:51,358
...are very cruel.

132
00:09:51,859 --> 00:09:55,761
They have a highly developed sense
of smell.

133
00:09:56,631 --> 00:09:59,464
A real witch could smell you
across the street...

134
00:09:59,533 --> 00:10:01,364
...on a pitch-black night.

135
00:10:01,669 --> 00:10:03,830
Not me. I just had a shower.

136
00:10:03,938 --> 00:10:05,235
Yes, she could.

137
00:10:05,506 --> 00:10:08,441
The cleaner you are,
the more a witch can smell you.

138
00:10:08,576 --> 00:10:10,168
That doesn't make sense.

139
00:10:10,244 --> 00:10:11,677
Yes, it does.

140
00:10:11,913 --> 00:10:15,041
A dirty child, it's the dirt she smells.

141
00:10:15,116 --> 00:10:17,414
A clean child, it is the child.

142
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:24,752
I'll never have a shower again,
and I'll have you for an excuse.

143
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:26,888
Well, just not too often.

144
00:10:26,961 --> 00:10:29,930
Only once a month is probably safe.

145
00:10:30,131 --> 00:10:32,622
So a witch could smell me right now?

146
00:10:32,867 --> 00:10:35,802
To me, you smell of raspberries
and cream...

147
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:40,204
...but to a witch, you would smell
absolutely disgusting.

148
00:10:40,942 --> 00:10:42,967
What kind of disgusting?

149
00:10:43,311 --> 00:10:45,905
Like dog's droppings.

150
00:10:46,747 --> 00:10:48,180
I don't believe it.

151
00:10:48,249 --> 00:10:49,773
You don't believe it?

152
00:10:50,251 --> 00:10:54,745
What's more, to a witch,
you'd smell of fresh dog's droppings.

153
00:10:54,822 --> 00:10:55,948
That's not true.

154
00:10:56,023 --> 00:10:58,491
There's no point in arguing.
It's a fact of life.

155
00:10:59,226 --> 00:11:03,458
So, if you see a woman holding her nose
as she passes you...

156
00:11:03,698 --> 00:11:05,495
...she could easily be a witch.

157
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:09,097
And now it is definitely bedtime.

158
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:12,829
Good night, Grandma.

159
00:11:48,642 --> 00:11:49,609
Mom?

160
00:11:51,245 --> 00:11:52,234
Dad?

161
00:12:27,181 --> 00:12:29,615
<i>Frau Evershim,
could I come in for a minute?</i>

162
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:32,276
I'm afraid I have some bad news.

163
00:12:32,653 --> 00:12:34,086
Come in.

164
00:12:34,722 --> 00:12:35,814
Wait here.

165
00:12:57,311 --> 00:12:58,801
Come here to me.

166
00:12:59,647 --> 00:13:00,636
Come on.

167
00:13:01,315 --> 00:13:03,044
Let's cuddle up here.

168
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,047
Sit on my lap.

169
00:13:26,207 --> 00:13:28,471
- Shall we bring them to England?
- Yes.

170
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:31,678
Let's do that. I think they're very good.

171
00:13:32,346 --> 00:13:33,711
I really do.

172
00:13:34,482 --> 00:13:37,815
Quite a talent there,
which I didn't know anything about.

173
00:13:41,255 --> 00:13:42,222
Thanks.

174
00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:56,294
<i>After the accident...</i>

175
00:13:56,504 --> 00:14:00,440
<i>... I didn't take Luke
back to America right away.</i>

176
00:14:00,908 --> 00:14:03,206
<i>We went to England where I had a house.</i>

177
00:14:03,377 --> 00:14:07,177
<i>He started at the school his parents
had chosen for him before they...</i>

178
00:14:07,248 --> 00:14:09,580
- Bald?
- That's why they wear wigs.

179
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:12,015
<i>Before they came to me on their vacation.</i>

180
00:14:12,086 --> 00:14:13,348
They itch and scratch a lot.

181
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,820
I saw a woman yesterday with purple eyes.

182
00:14:34,008 --> 00:14:35,373
Hello, young man.

183
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:38,744
What a magnificent tree house.

184
00:14:39,246 --> 00:14:40,975
Did you build it yourself?

185
00:14:41,148 --> 00:14:42,615
My dad and I did.

186
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:47,010
I've got something for you here.

187
00:14:48,189 --> 00:14:50,350
Something I think you'll like.

188
00:14:51,258 --> 00:14:53,089
- Jump down and I'll show you.
- No.

189
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,492
- What?
- No, thank you very much.

190
00:14:55,629 --> 00:14:57,893
It's worth a lot of money.

191
00:14:58,566 --> 00:14:59,999
This is private property.

192
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:01,796
There's nothing to be frightened of.

193
00:15:01,869 --> 00:15:03,962
I just wanted to give you this.

194
00:15:05,472 --> 00:15:08,873
I found him on my walk.
He's quite harmless.

195
00:15:10,811 --> 00:15:11,675
See?

196
00:15:12,813 --> 00:15:14,781
Little boys love snakes.

197
00:15:16,984 --> 00:15:18,576
Here, he's yours.

198
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,245
Grandma! Grandma!

199
00:15:21,355 --> 00:15:24,722
I'll leave him here if you like.
Then you can come down and get him.

200
00:15:25,993 --> 00:15:28,120
They wriggle away quite quickly...

201
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:31,893
...unless you tell them not to.

202
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,968
Grandma!

203
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:43,072
Perhaps you'd like some chocolate.

204
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:46,541
Grandma!

205
00:15:46,614 --> 00:15:49,242
She can't hear you.

206
00:15:50,851 --> 00:15:52,318
What's your name?

207
00:15:52,453 --> 00:15:53,442
Is it...

208
00:15:55,122 --> 00:15:56,180
...Luke?

209
00:15:57,124 --> 00:15:58,250
Thought so.

210
00:15:58,626 --> 00:16:00,617
Here you are, Luke.

211
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:05,063
A big bar of chocolate.

212
00:16:05,633 --> 00:16:07,362
- Lf you...
- Luke.

213
00:16:08,636 --> 00:16:10,297
Luke, it's dinnertime.

214
00:16:18,912 --> 00:16:21,005
Luke, dinnertime.

215
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:30,722
- Did you see her?
- Yes.

216
00:16:31,425 --> 00:16:34,087
I think she was a witch.
Gloves, purple eyes.

217
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:36,061
She wanted me to climb down and...

218
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:38,257
...she hypnotized a snake
she wanted to give me.

219
00:16:38,332 --> 00:16:39,800
A real one?

220
00:16:39,934 --> 00:16:41,458
A real snake, yes!

221
00:16:45,473 --> 00:16:46,565
I swear.

222
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:50,472
I believe you.

223
00:17:04,059 --> 00:17:05,856
Close your eyes. No cheating.

224
00:17:05,927 --> 00:17:08,054
To your chair. There we are.

225
00:17:08,129 --> 00:17:10,723
"Happy birthday to you

226
00:17:10,932 --> 00:17:13,332
"Happy birthday to you

227
00:17:13,501 --> 00:17:16,368
"Happy birthday, dear Luke

228
00:17:16,504 --> 00:17:18,267
"Happy birthday to you"

229
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:19,568
There!

230
00:17:19,674 --> 00:17:21,335
They're great!

231
00:17:22,143 --> 00:17:23,940
I'll build them a whole circus...

232
00:17:24,012 --> 00:17:26,913
...teach them tricks
and acrobatics and stuff.

233
00:17:27,082 --> 00:17:29,414
It must be so neat being a mouse.

234
00:17:29,484 --> 00:17:33,352
<i>Just play all day and eat,
and then play some more.</i>

235
00:17:33,722 --> 00:17:36,384
I'll rig up a whole room with...

236
00:17:37,959 --> 00:17:39,517
Grandma!

237
00:17:41,096 --> 00:17:42,393
Grandma!

238
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:48,565
Your granny has a mild case of diabetes.

239
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:50,399
It's nothing to worry about.

240
00:17:50,472 --> 00:17:53,839
Have a good rest,
and soon you'll be as right as rain.

241
00:17:53,908 --> 00:17:55,273
You'll be better.

242
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:57,737
I'm putting you on a sugar-free diet.

243
00:17:57,812 --> 00:18:01,111
No cakes, candies, or sugar at all.

244
00:18:01,983 --> 00:18:04,076
Those cigars won't do you any good.

245
00:18:04,152 --> 00:18:04,811
See?

246
00:18:04,886 --> 00:18:06,786
There are some more pills to take.

247
00:18:06,988 --> 00:18:09,422
With that and a good holiday
by the seaside...

248
00:18:09,557 --> 00:18:11,286
...you'll be good as new.

249
00:18:11,693 --> 00:18:14,856
Come on, leave your granny to rest.

250
00:18:14,963 --> 00:18:18,194
Perhaps you can bring her breakfast in bed
in the morning.

251
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,201
By tomorrow afternoon,
you can boss her around like before.

252
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:24,261
- Bye-bye, Mrs. Evershim.
- Bye-bye.

253
00:18:24,339 --> 00:18:26,170
See you in a couple of days.

254
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:28,835
- Can you find your way?
- Yes.

255
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:31,902
How come doctors speak to everybody
like they're babies?

256
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,208
I know.

257
00:18:34,382 --> 00:18:36,942
I'm sorry for spoiling your birthday...

258
00:18:37,118 --> 00:18:39,109
...and for giving you a fright.

259
00:18:40,188 --> 00:18:43,123
Is it all right if I play
with William and Mary now?

260
00:18:43,224 --> 00:18:44,521
Yes, of course.

261
00:19:02,877 --> 00:19:05,277
Listen, Mary Mouse,
when Grandma gets better...

262
00:19:05,346 --> 00:19:08,179
...we're going with her to a hotel
by the ocean.

263
00:19:08,316 --> 00:19:10,307
You've never been to the ocean.

264
00:19:10,585 --> 00:19:11,609
I'll tell you, it's big.

265
00:19:22,297 --> 00:19:24,162
Look at the hotel, Grandma.

266
00:19:24,432 --> 00:19:25,865
It's not half bad.

267
00:19:39,047 --> 00:19:40,844
- Welcome, madam.
- Thank you.

268
00:19:40,915 --> 00:19:42,883
Think it'll be a nice day, yes?

269
00:19:43,117 --> 00:19:44,641
Can you manage, Luke?

270
00:20:04,739 --> 00:20:06,536
Come on, Luke. There we go.

271
00:20:11,913 --> 00:20:14,473
Welcome to the Excelsior! Nicola Cole.

272
00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:16,107
I've looked forward to meeting you.

273
00:20:16,184 --> 00:20:17,549
You look marvelous.

274
00:20:17,619 --> 00:20:19,780
Wish I could say the same for you.

275
00:20:21,289 --> 00:20:24,019
Miss Ernst. I am the owner of the hotel.

276
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,519
We're very happy to have you here.

277
00:20:27,595 --> 00:20:29,859
Delighted. Should I sign or something?

278
00:20:30,031 --> 00:20:31,589
This is my secretary.

279
00:20:32,433 --> 00:20:34,162
Yes. How are you?

280
00:20:34,402 --> 00:20:35,767
Ladies.

281
00:20:36,571 --> 00:20:38,334
- Ina Clay Beckman.
- Indeed.

282
00:20:38,406 --> 00:20:39,998
<i>Julia Whitman.</i>

283
00:20:40,074 --> 00:20:42,804
<i>Julia. Yes. Where are you from?</i>

284
00:20:42,877 --> 00:20:44,174
Darlington.

285
00:20:44,779 --> 00:20:47,043
- Lois Leffour, from Southampton.
- Lois.

286
00:20:59,661 --> 00:21:02,027
In there, that must be where you sleep.

287
00:21:03,631 --> 00:21:06,566
The carpetbag on the bed, please.

288
00:21:07,168 --> 00:21:10,763
I'll have a wash and brush-up
while you explore the place.

289
00:21:10,972 --> 00:21:13,566
Then we shall have tea together...

290
00:21:13,841 --> 00:21:16,275
...and you'll show me around, yes?

291
00:21:16,344 --> 00:21:17,368
Thank you.

292
00:21:17,445 --> 00:21:18,844
Don't lock me out.

293
00:21:18,913 --> 00:21:20,778
I promise I won't.

294
00:21:31,259 --> 00:21:33,284
You look wonderful, Miss Ernst.

295
00:21:33,361 --> 00:21:36,296
We are looking forward to this afternoon.

296
00:22:15,703 --> 00:22:17,170
What are you doing?

297
00:22:17,939 --> 00:22:20,737
The raisins are all around the edge
of these cakes.

298
00:22:20,808 --> 00:22:22,298
They're really good.

299
00:22:22,543 --> 00:22:23,532
Thanks.

300
00:22:25,647 --> 00:22:26,944
My name's Luke.

301
00:22:28,783 --> 00:22:30,478
Bruno Jenkins.

302
00:22:30,885 --> 00:22:33,376
The cucumber sandwiches
are all right, too...

303
00:22:33,454 --> 00:22:36,389
...except when they use margarine
instead of butter.

304
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:39,021
How much pocket money do you get?

305
00:22:39,127 --> 00:22:42,290
My dad's rich, but he's very tight.

306
00:22:42,463 --> 00:22:44,021
We've got three cars.

307
00:22:44,098 --> 00:22:45,258
Hello, boys.

308
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,096
I hope there's butter
in the sandwiches today.

309
00:22:48,169 --> 00:22:50,763
I really do hate margarine.

310
00:22:51,639 --> 00:22:54,039
You've got those excellent cakes again.

311
00:22:54,108 --> 00:22:55,905
<i>There should be 14 of the...</i>

312
00:22:57,645 --> 00:22:59,010
Mr. Stringer!

313
00:23:01,516 --> 00:23:04,974
- What happened?
- I went to make the bed. They were there.

314
00:23:05,053 --> 00:23:07,851
- What?
- White and disgusting.

315
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:10,917
Calm down.

316
00:23:23,905 --> 00:23:25,998
Is this your room?

317
00:23:26,307 --> 00:23:27,433
Yes.

318
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:32,807
I'm sorry, madam,
but I cannot permit mice in my hotel.

319
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,041
How dare you say that
when your rotten hotel...

320
00:23:35,116 --> 00:23:37,050
...is full of rats anyway?

321
00:23:37,118 --> 00:23:38,346
Rats?

322
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,783
There are no rats in this hotel.

323
00:23:40,855 --> 00:23:44,518
I saw one this morning running
along the corridor into the kitchen.

324
00:23:44,959 --> 00:23:49,419
Madam, you only arrived in the hotel
this afternoon.

325
00:23:49,564 --> 00:23:50,895
Morning, afternoon.

326
00:23:50,965 --> 00:23:53,229
I saw a rat in your hotel...

327
00:23:53,334 --> 00:23:55,598
...and if matters do not improve...

328
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:59,128
...I'll have to report you
to the public health authorities.

329
00:24:01,409 --> 00:24:03,673
Look, madam, I'm not prepared...

330
00:24:03,745 --> 00:24:07,340
The cakes in the lounge are nibbled
all around the edges. I can show you.

331
00:24:07,415 --> 00:24:08,677
If you're not careful...

332
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:11,514
...the health people
will order the whole hotel closed...

333
00:24:11,586 --> 00:24:14,282
...before everyone gets typhoid fever.

334
00:24:14,355 --> 00:24:16,255
You can't be serious, madam.

335
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:18,756
I've never been more serious in my life.

336
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:22,956
Now, will you or will you not
let my grandchild...

337
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:26,989
...keep his hygienic
and perfectly harmless pet mice?

338
00:24:34,008 --> 00:24:37,034
If they are kept in the cage,
and only in this room.

339
00:24:37,111 --> 00:24:38,772
Nowhere else in the hotel!

340
00:24:38,846 --> 00:24:40,006
Agreed.

341
00:24:40,915 --> 00:24:42,007
Very well.

342
00:24:50,958 --> 00:24:52,050
Grandma...

343
00:24:52,126 --> 00:24:54,720
...I can't train my mice if they're in a cage.

344
00:24:54,796 --> 00:24:57,230
Nibbled cakes, indeed.

345
00:24:57,431 --> 00:25:01,128
There were,
only it was a boy called Bruno Jenkins.

346
00:25:01,269 --> 00:25:05,433
I'm teaching William and Mary
how to be tightrope walkers.

347
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:08,100
I brought the circus I'm building with me.

348
00:25:08,176 --> 00:25:09,575
Good. Show me.

349
00:25:13,247 --> 00:25:14,305
Let's see.

350
00:25:14,382 --> 00:25:16,873
Look. I'm planning them a major house.

351
00:25:16,951 --> 00:25:20,978
Ramp ways here, a bathtub.
This elevator's pretty neat.

352
00:25:21,055 --> 00:25:25,492
You really did this yourself?
It's good. I'm impressed.

353
00:25:25,626 --> 00:25:27,218
You must train your mice...

354
00:25:27,295 --> 00:25:30,128
...but you mustn't get caught
or do it in here...

355
00:25:30,198 --> 00:25:32,996
...because if that hysterical maid
comes back...

356
00:25:34,836 --> 00:25:36,326
Now it's teatime.

357
00:25:36,404 --> 00:25:40,033
I just love English hotel teas.

358
00:25:40,141 --> 00:25:42,666
Cream cakes and shortbread and...

359
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:44,004
No, Grandma.

360
00:25:44,078 --> 00:25:45,875
No cream cakes.

361
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:48,380
And no shortbread, either.
It's full of sugar.

362
00:25:48,449 --> 00:25:51,145
I shall end up eating the same diet
as your mice.

363
00:25:51,853 --> 00:25:54,879
That's the trouble with this country:
A queue for everything.

364
00:25:55,089 --> 00:25:57,216
They wouldn't think to have
two tea trolleys.

365
00:25:57,291 --> 00:26:00,158
No, that'd be too convenient
for the paying guests.

366
00:26:00,428 --> 00:26:03,363
They'll want two lumps of ice
in their whiskey next.

367
00:26:03,598 --> 00:26:06,431
They'd queue for their own funerals
if they could.

368
00:26:07,001 --> 00:26:09,697
I know that woman from somewhere...

369
00:26:10,271 --> 00:26:13,069
...but I can't for the life of me
remember where.

370
00:26:15,009 --> 00:26:17,535
Her face is so familiar.

371
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,077
Which one?

372
00:26:20,282 --> 00:26:22,045
My memory's going.

373
00:26:22,117 --> 00:26:24,517
But it's as if I met her before.

374
00:26:25,053 --> 00:26:27,146
She's probably on TV or something.

375
00:26:27,856 --> 00:26:29,847
Cucumber sandwiches.

376
00:26:32,794 --> 00:26:34,591
Fish paste.

377
00:26:34,663 --> 00:26:36,460
You got the wrong one.

378
00:26:37,666 --> 00:26:39,861
Oh, no. Sugar.

379
00:26:40,102 --> 00:26:42,036
Sugar can kill you.

380
00:26:42,137 --> 00:26:45,129
I know, but it was very little.

381
00:26:46,108 --> 00:26:48,872
Something very odd is going on.

382
00:26:48,944 --> 00:26:50,377
Are you listening to me?

383
00:26:50,445 --> 00:26:53,539
You'll have some fresh air
if I have to take you out by your ear.

384
00:26:54,383 --> 00:26:57,580
We didn't come here for you to sit eating
and watch telly all day.

385
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,855
All the other boys are out there
playing in the water.

386
00:27:00,923 --> 00:27:02,356
Pick up your knife.

387
00:27:02,424 --> 00:27:04,324
You're just like your father.

388
00:27:10,432 --> 00:27:12,024
Good afternoon, madam.

389
00:27:14,503 --> 00:27:15,333
Go on.

390
00:27:15,404 --> 00:27:17,304
Are you sure you're all right?

391
00:27:18,106 --> 00:27:19,334
Fine, fine.

392
00:27:20,609 --> 00:27:22,600
What are you going to do now?

393
00:27:22,678 --> 00:27:25,704
I'm gonna take William and Mary
and explore this place.

394
00:27:25,781 --> 00:27:28,579
<i>Just don't get into trouble, will you?</i>

395
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:29,617
I won't.

396
00:27:29,685 --> 00:27:30,777
Come on.

397
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:37,181
Excuse me, please.

398
00:27:40,862 --> 00:27:42,261
That's fine.

399
00:27:44,032 --> 00:27:45,795
Carry on with the rest of them.

400
00:27:45,867 --> 00:27:47,858
No. In the kitchen.

401
00:28:40,889 --> 00:28:42,049
Wait there.

402
00:28:58,273 --> 00:29:00,138
Great. Now do it again.

403
00:29:02,077 --> 00:29:03,339
Come on.

404
00:29:03,412 --> 00:29:06,643
I'm sure your delegates
will be comfortable in here.

405
00:29:06,915 --> 00:29:09,076
If there's anything we can do...

406
00:29:09,217 --> 00:29:11,117
Come on, Nicola, down the front!

407
00:29:13,321 --> 00:29:16,415
Drinks will be served on the terrace after...

408
00:29:17,325 --> 00:29:19,156
...you've concluded your meeting.

409
00:29:19,227 --> 00:29:21,422
Skies are clearing, I'm glad to say.

410
00:29:21,997 --> 00:29:23,055
Sit down.

411
00:29:23,131 --> 00:29:25,725
We've prepared a fine meal for you tonight.

412
00:29:25,801 --> 00:29:27,666
The chef's special soup...

413
00:29:35,677 --> 00:29:37,076
Look at her eyes.

414
00:29:40,482 --> 00:29:41,949
I'll leave you to business.

415
00:29:42,017 --> 00:29:43,382
Fine. Thank you.

416
00:29:44,219 --> 00:29:46,016
Everybody sitting?

417
00:29:46,388 --> 00:29:47,821
Up front, sit down!

418
00:29:47,889 --> 00:29:50,289
Not yet!

419
00:29:50,725 --> 00:29:51,953
We've got to get out of here.

420
00:29:52,027 --> 00:29:53,324
Come along, ladies.

421
00:29:53,395 --> 00:29:55,989
The sooner you're ready,
the sooner we can start.

422
00:29:57,999 --> 00:30:00,263
Thank you for letting me stay.

423
00:30:00,335 --> 00:30:03,065
- That's all right, Elsie.
- I'll lock up.

424
00:30:03,138 --> 00:30:04,162
- Good.
- Good.

425
00:30:04,239 --> 00:30:05,604
Then we'll begin.

426
00:30:35,337 --> 00:30:38,306
You may remove your shoes.

427
00:30:42,377 --> 00:30:44,777
You may remove your wigs.

428
00:30:46,114 --> 00:30:49,106
The doors, are they locked and bolted?

429
00:30:50,418 --> 00:30:52,477
Locked and bolted, Your Grandness.

430
00:30:52,554 --> 00:30:53,987
Good. Help me.

431
00:31:17,979 --> 00:31:20,777
Witches of England...

432
00:31:22,417 --> 00:31:24,942
...you're a disgrace!

433
00:31:26,188 --> 00:31:28,019
Miserable witches...

434
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:32,526
...you are good-for-nothing worms!

435
00:31:33,762 --> 00:31:35,662
Everywhere I look...

436
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,991
...I see the repulsive sight...

437
00:31:41,336 --> 00:31:42,894
...of hundreds...

438
00:31:43,939 --> 00:31:45,804
...thousands...

439
00:31:46,441 --> 00:31:48,466
...of revolting little children.

440
00:31:51,479 --> 00:31:52,844
I ask you:

441
00:31:54,082 --> 00:31:55,071
Why?

442
00:31:58,353 --> 00:32:00,981
One child a week is no good to me.

443
00:32:01,923 --> 00:32:03,288
We will do better.

444
00:32:03,458 --> 00:32:05,426
We will do much better.

445
00:32:06,127 --> 00:32:09,153
Better is no good, either!

446
00:32:10,565 --> 00:32:14,729
I demand maximum results.

447
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:16,998
So...

448
00:32:18,173 --> 00:32:20,698
...here are my orders.

449
00:32:22,077 --> 00:32:24,136
My orders are...

450
00:32:25,046 --> 00:32:26,946
...that every child...

451
00:32:27,816 --> 00:32:29,181
...in England...

452
00:32:29,918 --> 00:32:31,909
...shall be rubbed out.

453
00:32:32,621 --> 00:32:33,986
Destroyed!

454
00:32:35,457 --> 00:32:38,153
Every single child eliminated!

455
00:32:39,794 --> 00:32:43,059
Do I make myself clear?

456
00:32:47,602 --> 00:32:49,900
We can't possibly wipe out all of them.

457
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:52,900
Who spoke?

458
00:32:55,744 --> 00:32:57,974
Who dares to argue with me?

459
00:33:01,483 --> 00:33:02,916
It was you?

460
00:33:03,385 --> 00:33:04,852
I didn't mean to argue.

461
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:07,752
You dare to argue with me?

462
00:33:07,856 --> 00:33:10,188
No, honestly. It just was a...

463
00:33:10,692 --> 00:33:13,923
A stupid witch who answers back...

464
00:33:14,129 --> 00:33:16,689
...must burn until her bones are black!

465
00:33:16,798 --> 00:33:17,787
No.

466
00:33:17,899 --> 00:33:19,457
A foolish witch...

467
00:33:20,168 --> 00:33:21,692
...without a brain...

468
00:33:22,304 --> 00:33:24,966
...must sizzle into fiery flame!

469
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,034
A witch...

470
00:33:27,309 --> 00:33:29,834
...who dares to say I'm wrong...

471
00:33:31,146 --> 00:33:33,614
...will not be with us...

472
00:33:33,882 --> 00:33:35,110
...very long!

473
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,944
What the devil?

474
00:33:57,072 --> 00:34:01,805
I hope nobody else
is going to make me cross today.

475
00:34:05,613 --> 00:34:07,808
Now, this is my plan.

476
00:34:09,117 --> 00:34:10,379
Each of you...

477
00:34:10,952 --> 00:34:12,977
...will go back to your homes...

478
00:34:13,421 --> 00:34:16,322
...and resign from your jobs.

479
00:34:17,125 --> 00:34:18,319
Give notice.

480
00:34:18,793 --> 00:34:19,987
Retire.

481
00:34:21,696 --> 00:34:24,597
You will then buy,
with the money I give you...

482
00:34:25,567 --> 00:34:26,898
...sweet shops.

483
00:34:27,402 --> 00:34:28,664
Candy stores.

484
00:34:29,738 --> 00:34:33,970
The best and most respectable
sweet shops in England.

485
00:34:40,715 --> 00:34:44,378
Upstairs I have a trunkload
of this English money...

486
00:34:44,686 --> 00:34:46,950
...so you'll be able to offer three...

487
00:34:47,021 --> 00:34:50,047
...maybe four times
what these shops are worth.

488
00:34:50,125 --> 00:34:51,114
Go.

489
00:34:54,162 --> 00:34:55,925
On a certain day...

490
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:58,498
...when all our plans are prepared...

491
00:34:58,633 --> 00:35:03,263
...you'll announce a great gala opening...

492
00:35:03,471 --> 00:35:07,805
...with free sweets, candies,
and chocolates for every child.

493
00:35:08,476 --> 00:35:09,966
Poison sweets.

494
00:35:10,178 --> 00:35:12,908
We'll wipe them out like weasels.

495
00:35:13,681 --> 00:35:15,615
- Who spoke?
- She did!

496
00:35:17,252 --> 00:35:18,583
It's brilliant.

497
00:35:19,287 --> 00:35:20,254
Poison?

498
00:35:21,423 --> 00:35:23,891
And you don't mind getting caught?

499
00:35:24,793 --> 00:35:26,590
Exposed?

500
00:35:26,928 --> 00:35:28,862
Vilified?

501
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:30,227
I just thought...

502
00:35:30,298 --> 00:35:32,129
Spineless bumpkin!

503
00:35:32,767 --> 00:35:34,997
You blithering bogvumper!

504
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:38,505
No wonder England is swarming with...

505
00:35:49,851 --> 00:35:52,877
Everything you sell that day...

506
00:35:54,189 --> 00:35:56,021
...will have been treated...

507
00:35:56,392 --> 00:35:58,383
...with my very latest...

508
00:35:59,195 --> 00:36:02,494
...and very greatest magic formula.

509
00:36:03,966 --> 00:36:07,527
Witches work only with magic!

510
00:36:08,737 --> 00:36:10,102
Wait. Come here.

511
00:36:11,073 --> 00:36:13,303
<i>Formula 86.</i>

512
00:36:14,043 --> 00:36:15,567
My greatest triumph.

513
00:36:17,179 --> 00:36:18,373
A work of...

514
00:36:19,682 --> 00:36:21,013
...genius.

515
00:36:22,518 --> 00:36:24,918
<i>Formula 86!</i>

516
00:36:25,821 --> 00:36:27,152
In this bottle...

517
00:36:27,656 --> 00:36:30,750
...500 doses...

518
00:36:30,826 --> 00:36:32,657
...with a delay mechanism...

519
00:36:32,728 --> 00:36:35,856
...that prevents it from working
until two hours...

520
00:36:36,098 --> 00:36:37,895
...after it has been taken.

521
00:36:40,903 --> 00:36:42,302
What does it do...

522
00:36:42,738 --> 00:36:44,365
...genius one?

523
00:36:52,948 --> 00:36:54,074
One dose...

524
00:36:54,783 --> 00:36:57,047
...and the time works to the second.

525
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:00,620
But more than five doses...

526
00:37:00,923 --> 00:37:02,618
...breaks the delay barrier...

527
00:37:02,691 --> 00:37:05,524
...and the formula works instantly.

528
00:37:13,269 --> 00:37:14,429
The child...

529
00:37:16,872 --> 00:37:18,362
...starts to shrink.

530
00:37:23,112 --> 00:37:24,602
The child...

531
00:37:25,581 --> 00:37:27,344
...starts to...

532
00:37:28,417 --> 00:37:29,907
...grow fur.

533
00:37:33,522 --> 00:37:34,614
Starts...

534
00:37:35,357 --> 00:37:37,450
...growing a tail.

535
00:37:40,229 --> 00:37:43,756
All this happens in precisely 25 seconds!

536
00:37:47,236 --> 00:37:49,932
Shrinking more.

537
00:37:54,577 --> 00:37:56,067
The child...

538
00:37:56,378 --> 00:37:59,313
...is no longer a child.

539
00:38:06,655 --> 00:38:08,122
The child...

540
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,491
...is a mouse!

541
00:38:17,299 --> 00:38:18,493
Silence.

542
00:38:19,301 --> 00:38:20,563
Shut up.

543
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:23,504
Silence. Enough.

544
00:38:28,577 --> 00:38:29,976
This afternoon...

545
00:38:30,479 --> 00:38:33,004
...at precisely 4:15...

546
00:38:33,549 --> 00:38:35,915
...I put one dose of my formula...

547
00:38:36,151 --> 00:38:37,880
...on a bar of chocolate.

548
00:38:39,355 --> 00:38:41,949
I gave it to a repulsive...

549
00:38:42,024 --> 00:38:43,582
...smelly boy...

550
00:38:43,659 --> 00:38:45,354
...who was in the lobby.

551
00:38:47,496 --> 00:38:50,397
"Was that good?" I asked him.

552
00:38:52,635 --> 00:38:54,466
"Got any more?"...

553
00:38:55,671 --> 00:38:57,605
...said the nauseating child.

554
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:01,906
"Six more bars like that one," I told him.

555
00:39:04,313 --> 00:39:06,076
In two minutes' time...

556
00:39:06,181 --> 00:39:08,649
...this appalling, foul-smelling creature...

557
00:39:08,717 --> 00:39:11,345
...is coming to collect his reward.

558
00:39:12,955 --> 00:39:14,923
In five minutes' time...

559
00:39:15,057 --> 00:39:17,992
...you'll see my magic formula in action.

560
00:39:20,929 --> 00:39:22,396
We're going to see.

561
00:39:26,902 --> 00:39:28,836
Quickly! Wigs! Gloves!

562
00:39:29,271 --> 00:39:31,398
The appalling child will be here...

563
00:39:32,341 --> 00:39:34,275
...and you'll see my miracle.

564
00:39:34,376 --> 00:39:36,606
Come on. Hurry up!

565
00:39:37,379 --> 00:39:38,744
That's good.

566
00:39:39,381 --> 00:39:40,871
Hurry up, everybody.

567
00:39:41,183 --> 00:39:42,172
Come on!

568
00:39:45,587 --> 00:39:48,147
Quickly! You're not on holiday!

569
00:39:48,257 --> 00:39:50,020
I'm being as quick as I can.

570
00:39:50,092 --> 00:39:51,150
Hurry up!

571
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:02,302
Ready.

572
00:40:04,406 --> 00:40:07,034
Hello, little boy.

573
00:40:07,509 --> 00:40:09,101
Come on in then.

574
00:40:09,878 --> 00:40:12,244
Come on. Wait just there.

575
00:40:17,786 --> 00:40:19,720
What's your name then?

576
00:40:20,522 --> 00:40:21,682
Bruno.

577
00:40:22,791 --> 00:40:23,985
Madam!

578
00:40:39,408 --> 00:40:42,707
That lady promised me six whole bars...

579
00:40:42,778 --> 00:40:46,214
...of cream-whip hazelnut milk chocolate.

580
00:40:49,485 --> 00:40:51,453
I've come to collect.

581
00:40:53,489 --> 00:40:54,649
Ladies...

582
00:40:55,624 --> 00:40:57,819
...may I introduce Bruno?

583
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,759
Come up, Bruno.

584
00:41:00,229 --> 00:41:01,958
I have the chocolate here.

585
00:41:06,435 --> 00:41:08,733
I said 6:15.

586
00:41:09,738 --> 00:41:12,639
And that is 15 seconds from now.

587
00:41:18,447 --> 00:41:20,540
You are in for a treat.

588
00:41:23,852 --> 00:41:25,410
We all are!

589
00:41:32,227 --> 00:41:34,195
What's going on?

590
00:41:34,797 --> 00:41:36,594
<i>Just a few moments.</i>

591
00:41:39,101 --> 00:41:40,068
Five...

592
00:41:40,135 --> 00:41:41,864
I can't see any chocolates.

593
00:41:41,937 --> 00:41:46,897
...three, two, one, zero!

594
00:41:51,446 --> 00:41:54,609
We have ignition!

595
00:41:56,285 --> 00:41:58,913
Everybody, look! It's fantastic!

596
00:41:58,987 --> 00:42:00,113
It's begun!

597
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:04,054
I can't stand it! It's so wonderful!

598
00:42:04,893 --> 00:42:06,520
It's fantastic!

599
00:42:36,592 --> 00:42:38,082
Where'd he go?

600
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:45,667
Keys!

601
00:42:47,502 --> 00:42:49,231
Enough! Silence!

602
00:42:50,005 --> 00:42:53,497
Before the banquet tonight,
come to my room in groups of 10.

603
00:42:53,742 --> 00:42:55,369
Room number 208.

604
00:42:56,011 --> 00:42:58,809
I'll give you each a bottle
containing 500 doses.

605
00:42:59,181 --> 00:43:00,705
Also plenty of money.

606
00:43:01,116 --> 00:43:03,914
Do not forget your nose plugs
for the dinner.

607
00:43:04,152 --> 00:43:06,643
The dining room will be full
of filthy children.

608
00:43:06,722 --> 00:43:10,249
Without your nose plugs,
the stink will be unbearable.

609
00:43:11,093 --> 00:43:14,688
Now we'll have drinks on the terrace
with that ridiculous manager.

610
00:43:14,763 --> 00:43:16,287
Any questions?

611
00:43:18,066 --> 00:43:21,866
What if one of the chocolates
were accidentally eaten by a grownup?

612
00:43:23,305 --> 00:43:25,830
That's just too bad for the grownup.

613
00:43:25,908 --> 00:43:27,432
The meeting is over.

614
00:43:28,377 --> 00:43:29,742
Until next year.

615
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:35,772
Wait!

616
00:43:43,558 --> 00:43:44,820
I smell...

617
00:43:46,662 --> 00:43:48,129
...dog's droppings.

618
00:43:52,467 --> 00:43:53,627
She's right.

619
00:43:55,737 --> 00:43:57,329
The smell!

620
00:44:09,918 --> 00:44:11,078
She's right!

621
00:44:14,156 --> 00:44:16,750
Search out this small lump of dung!

622
00:44:19,161 --> 00:44:20,185
Find it!

623
00:44:21,029 --> 00:44:24,055
It must be exterminated immediately!

624
00:44:31,673 --> 00:44:33,436
There he is!

625
00:44:53,362 --> 00:44:54,727
He's wiggling through.

626
00:44:54,796 --> 00:44:56,058
He's getting away.

627
00:44:56,131 --> 00:44:57,564
Come here, boy.

628
00:44:58,166 --> 00:44:59,497
Bring him to me!

629
00:45:17,619 --> 00:45:19,109
There he is!

630
00:45:48,484 --> 00:45:50,213
I saw him come this way.

631
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:51,910
Where could he be?

632
00:46:07,303 --> 00:46:08,531
Bye-bye.

633
00:46:18,848 --> 00:46:20,645
No! My baby! Stop!

634
00:46:30,693 --> 00:46:32,684
A baby in a pram.

635
00:46:36,899 --> 00:46:37,923
Lovely!

636
00:46:50,213 --> 00:46:51,202
Oh, no.

637
00:46:51,981 --> 00:46:53,881
Get the boy! He's getting away!

638
00:47:38,294 --> 00:47:39,659
Grandma, wake up!

639
00:47:40,396 --> 00:47:42,125
Please, Grandma!

640
00:47:43,966 --> 00:47:45,297
My grandma!

641
00:47:45,735 --> 00:47:48,670
An old adversary, I have discovered.

642
00:47:49,405 --> 00:47:50,997
Very old.

643
00:47:51,073 --> 00:47:52,973
If you hurt my grandma...

644
00:47:53,042 --> 00:47:54,100
Silence!

645
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:59,241
We've got him, madam.

646
00:48:06,022 --> 00:48:07,717
Don't bite.

647
00:48:10,193 --> 00:48:11,626
Open up.

648
00:48:13,996 --> 00:48:15,554
Five hundred doses.

649
00:48:21,571 --> 00:48:22,697
Come along.

650
00:48:24,273 --> 00:48:25,262
Get up.

651
00:48:38,988 --> 00:48:40,182
Look.

652
00:48:46,662 --> 00:48:51,725
This stinking little carbuncle
has had 500 doses.

653
00:48:52,635 --> 00:48:55,433
We are having instantaneous action.

654
00:49:09,318 --> 00:49:10,808
'Bye.

655
00:49:29,005 --> 00:49:30,165
Kill him.

656
00:49:31,274 --> 00:49:32,263
Kill him!

657
00:49:45,588 --> 00:49:47,681
Leave that little stinkpot!

658
00:49:48,024 --> 00:49:49,958
It's not worth bothering about.

659
00:49:50,026 --> 00:49:53,427
Come. Some whiskey and champagne
to celebrate.

660
00:49:54,864 --> 00:49:57,833
Bruno? I don't believe it, I can talk.

661
00:49:58,534 --> 00:49:59,523
Bruno?

662
00:50:02,204 --> 00:50:03,466
Who's that?

663
00:50:03,539 --> 00:50:05,769
Bruno, it's me. Luke.

664
00:50:07,476 --> 00:50:09,205
I'm down here.

665
00:50:09,879 --> 00:50:11,676
Where? I can't see you.

666
00:50:11,747 --> 00:50:13,374
Down here.

667
00:50:13,582 --> 00:50:14,947
You can talk, too.

668
00:50:15,017 --> 00:50:16,348
This is weird.

669
00:50:20,389 --> 00:50:22,755
- This icing is terrific.
- Are you okay?

670
00:50:22,825 --> 00:50:25,589
They didn't give me
the six bars of chocolate.

671
00:50:25,661 --> 00:50:28,494
You couldn't eat six bars of candy
now that you're a mouse.

672
00:50:28,731 --> 00:50:30,858
Don't be stupid. I'm not a...

673
00:50:31,567 --> 00:50:33,762
<i>Just because you're a...</i>

674
00:50:34,203 --> 00:50:36,228
That doesn't mean that I'm a...

675
00:50:37,673 --> 00:50:39,163
Good Lord.

676
00:50:42,845 --> 00:50:45,245
I'm not too keen on being a mouse.

677
00:50:45,314 --> 00:50:46,975
We gotta find a way out of here.

678
00:50:47,049 --> 00:50:49,483
How long before we change back,
do you think?

679
00:50:49,552 --> 00:50:50,849
I don't think we will.

680
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:52,444
Of course we will.

681
00:50:52,655 --> 00:50:56,557
We've gotta get upstairs and wake
my grandma. I'm real worried about her.

682
00:50:57,193 --> 00:51:00,492
Maybe it was the witch, or her diabetes.

683
00:51:00,763 --> 00:51:03,163
I only know she didn't wake up when I...

684
00:51:03,799 --> 00:51:05,630
She's got some peanuts, too.

685
00:51:06,402 --> 00:51:07,767
Dry-roasted?

686
00:51:08,904 --> 00:51:10,428
All right.

687
00:51:11,474 --> 00:51:12,634
Come on.

688
00:51:14,410 --> 00:51:15,934
William and Mary!

689
00:51:16,078 --> 00:51:17,909
Hi. It's me, Luke.

690
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:19,572
Are you two all right?

691
00:51:19,949 --> 00:51:23,009
Crikey. Did they eat the chocolate as well?

692
00:51:23,285 --> 00:51:26,743
They were my pet mice.
But I guess they can't talk like we can.

693
00:51:26,956 --> 00:51:28,446
Catch you two later.

694
00:51:33,796 --> 00:51:35,093
Come on, Bruno.

695
00:51:36,298 --> 00:51:37,322
This way.

696
00:51:55,651 --> 00:51:56,743
They're gone.

697
00:51:56,819 --> 00:51:58,116
It's all clear.

698
00:51:58,421 --> 00:51:59,410
Come on.

699
00:52:00,623 --> 00:52:02,056
Wait for me.

700
00:52:04,827 --> 00:52:09,321
Running on a full stomach
isn't good for you.

701
00:52:09,398 --> 00:52:11,127
Better than being caught.

702
00:52:14,770 --> 00:52:18,262
- Keep up, Bruno.
- Sports give me indigestion.

703
00:52:23,479 --> 00:52:24,468
Get back.

704
00:52:24,547 --> 00:52:27,607
Okay, when I say "go", go!

705
00:52:28,484 --> 00:52:29,280
Go!

706
00:52:29,351 --> 00:52:30,784
- Run!
- Wait.

707
00:52:33,956 --> 00:52:35,116
Follow me.

708
00:52:42,364 --> 00:52:44,093
How will we get upstairs?

709
00:52:44,633 --> 00:52:45,565
I'm sorry.

710
00:52:45,634 --> 00:52:48,125
I don't know what I'm paying for.
I really don't.

711
00:52:48,204 --> 00:52:49,432
An overheated room.

712
00:52:49,505 --> 00:52:52,406
Dad? Hey, there's my dad!

713
00:52:52,508 --> 00:52:54,942
He doesn't know what's happened.
He'll kill you.

714
00:52:55,010 --> 00:52:56,341
My own father?

715
00:52:56,846 --> 00:53:00,373
The photographer of that brochure
should be arrested for fraud.

716
00:53:00,449 --> 00:53:03,009
I'm going to tell him. He'll put a stop to it.

717
00:53:03,219 --> 00:53:04,481
No, not now.

718
00:53:04,653 --> 00:53:07,918
Trust me, he'll stamp on you
the moment he sees you.

719
00:53:08,157 --> 00:53:09,146
Quick!

720
00:53:12,261 --> 00:53:14,593
It's so nice not having the kids around.

721
00:53:15,664 --> 00:53:19,122
I smell food. Is there anything in this bag?

722
00:53:19,735 --> 00:53:21,066
They'll be fine.

723
00:53:21,136 --> 00:53:23,161
I think John was getting a cold.

724
00:53:23,239 --> 00:53:26,436
It's always the same.
You must relax once in a while.

725
00:53:26,509 --> 00:53:27,874
All right.

726
00:53:29,545 --> 00:53:30,876
This is it. Let's go.

727
00:53:30,946 --> 00:53:32,709
- No more sports!
- Hurry!

728
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:36,513
Faster! Faster!

729
00:53:39,555 --> 00:53:41,352
I forgot my tail.

730
00:53:43,225 --> 00:53:44,988
Keep to the side!

731
00:53:49,131 --> 00:53:51,463
Being like this might not be so bad.

732
00:53:51,934 --> 00:53:53,925
There won't be any more school.

733
00:53:54,169 --> 00:53:55,602
That would be all right.

734
00:53:55,671 --> 00:53:58,231
Look at that. Don't eat the cheese.

735
00:53:58,307 --> 00:54:02,300
Remember, we've got two enemies now:
Humans and cats.

736
00:54:02,411 --> 00:54:04,538
We've got three cats at home.

737
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:05,747
They'll have to go.

738
00:54:05,814 --> 00:54:08,840
My mother loves them,
but she's terrified of mice.

739
00:54:10,419 --> 00:54:11,408
Grandma!

740
00:54:12,555 --> 00:54:13,544
Grandma!

741
00:54:17,159 --> 00:54:19,218
Take your afternoon off tomorrow.

742
00:54:22,698 --> 00:54:23,665
Let's go.

743
00:54:23,732 --> 00:54:25,290
What? Hey, wait!

744
00:54:25,801 --> 00:54:28,702
There are four more floors to be done.

745
00:54:28,771 --> 00:54:29,863
Yes, sir.

746
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:32,539
You do over there.

747
00:54:33,676 --> 00:54:35,303
I'll get this one.

748
00:54:35,878 --> 00:54:36,845
Back.

749
00:54:39,682 --> 00:54:41,274
It bit me!

750
00:54:41,450 --> 00:54:43,782
- What bit you?
- A mouse in the towel.

751
00:54:44,587 --> 00:54:45,952
A mouse?

752
00:54:55,464 --> 00:54:56,624
Is she sober?

753
00:54:56,699 --> 00:54:59,759
Of course she's sober.
I've been with her all after...

754
00:55:00,069 --> 00:55:01,502
I mean, I...

755
00:55:02,104 --> 00:55:03,435
...I saw her...

756
00:55:03,505 --> 00:55:05,439
Yes, she's sober. Don't be stupid.

757
00:55:05,507 --> 00:55:07,134
Go to the second floor.

758
00:55:07,343 --> 00:55:09,504
Grandma! Grandma!

759
00:55:10,613 --> 00:55:12,137
Here by the phone.

760
00:55:13,984 --> 00:55:15,417
It's me Luke.

761
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:18,719
Are you all right?

762
00:55:21,458 --> 00:55:22,447
Luke?

763
00:55:22,892 --> 00:55:24,359
It's me, Grandma.

764
00:55:26,930 --> 00:55:27,794
Luke!

765
00:55:27,897 --> 00:55:30,457
It was the Grand High Witch.
She is in this hotel.

766
00:55:30,533 --> 00:55:32,228
My God!

767
00:55:32,769 --> 00:55:35,067
Don't cry. It's okay.

768
00:55:35,305 --> 00:55:37,102
Things could have been worse.

769
00:55:37,173 --> 00:55:38,538
I got away from them.

770
00:55:38,608 --> 00:55:40,075
I'm still alive.

771
00:55:40,377 --> 00:55:42,368
My darling Luke.

772
00:55:42,612 --> 00:55:44,204
What have they done to you?

773
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:46,248
They turned me into a mouse.

774
00:55:47,651 --> 00:55:50,620
I'm sorry. I can't stop shaking.

775
00:55:51,488 --> 00:55:53,956
The Grand High Witch, here?

776
00:55:54,124 --> 00:55:56,922
There's hundreds of them
right here in this hotel.

777
00:55:57,293 --> 00:56:00,126
I knew it. I could see it in her eyes.

778
00:56:00,463 --> 00:56:01,862
Lord.

779
00:56:02,966 --> 00:56:04,763
You squashed me.

780
00:56:06,036 --> 00:56:08,197
Grandma. This is Bruno Jenkins.

781
00:56:08,438 --> 00:56:09,268
I'm sorry.

782
00:56:09,339 --> 00:56:12,172
He said you've got dry-roast peanuts.

783
00:56:13,076 --> 00:56:14,202
Yes.

784
00:56:15,211 --> 00:56:16,473
Good. Thanks.

785
00:56:19,449 --> 00:56:20,973
We've got to stop them.

786
00:56:21,051 --> 00:56:24,748
They leave tomorrow with a bundle
of money and gallons of a formula...

787
00:56:24,821 --> 00:56:27,881
...that will change every kid in England
into a mouse.

788
00:56:27,957 --> 00:56:29,549
We must stop them.

789
00:56:31,327 --> 00:56:32,885
- Miss Ernst.
- Lois.

790
00:56:34,764 --> 00:56:37,096
Nice to see a bit of international clientele.

791
00:56:37,434 --> 00:56:39,527
- How do you do?
- Just flew in, did you?

792
00:56:39,602 --> 00:56:40,569
What?

793
00:56:40,637 --> 00:56:43,572
<i>Jet lag's the curse of the business classes.</i>

794
00:56:43,707 --> 00:56:45,368
Hope you don't mind me joining you.

795
00:56:45,442 --> 00:56:47,171
You're most welcome, sir.

796
00:56:48,511 --> 00:56:49,876
Herbert Jenkins.

797
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:52,378
I'd like to say hello
to a fellow philanthropist.

798
00:56:52,882 --> 00:56:54,543
You collect stamps?

799
00:56:54,617 --> 00:56:55,879
Charities.

800
00:56:56,086 --> 00:56:58,611
This R.S.P.C.C.

801
00:56:58,688 --> 00:56:59,985
What is this R.S. P...

802
00:57:00,056 --> 00:57:01,546
Cruelty to children.

803
00:57:02,192 --> 00:57:05,184
Of course, you give money for the little...

804
00:57:07,997 --> 00:57:09,589
...children and...

805
00:57:10,433 --> 00:57:11,923
...we, of course...

806
00:57:12,168 --> 00:57:14,534
...we also give money for the little...

807
00:57:16,706 --> 00:57:18,833
I see you're holding your annual meeting.

808
00:57:18,908 --> 00:57:20,068
Funnily enough...

809
00:57:20,143 --> 00:57:23,374
...I addressed the last annual meeting
of our Rotary Club.

810
00:57:23,813 --> 00:57:26,646
Do you know much
about this country's Rotary Club?

811
00:57:31,588 --> 00:57:34,182
If I could get the formula into their food...

812
00:57:35,325 --> 00:57:38,385
You just have to get me down
to the Grand High Witch's room.

813
00:57:39,129 --> 00:57:40,221
I'm ready.

814
00:57:41,097 --> 00:57:42,428
I don't know.

815
00:57:42,532 --> 00:57:44,659
I've got to find the formula.

816
00:57:45,168 --> 00:57:45,998
No.

817
00:57:46,569 --> 00:57:48,230
This is too dangerous.

818
00:57:48,304 --> 00:57:49,464
Grandma.

819
00:57:52,408 --> 00:57:54,205
It's not far down.

820
00:57:54,511 --> 00:57:57,844
You're asking me to lower you
into the jaws of death.

821
00:57:57,914 --> 00:58:00,576
You two can't take on
the Grand High Witch.

822
00:58:00,784 --> 00:58:03,218
We can. We've got to.

823
00:58:03,353 --> 00:58:05,184
No one else will believe us.

824
00:58:05,255 --> 00:58:07,314
Quick, before she comes back.

825
00:58:16,232 --> 00:58:17,859
Luke, be careful.

826
00:58:18,868 --> 00:58:20,199
Please be careful.

827
00:58:20,270 --> 00:58:21,601
I'll be careful.

828
00:58:21,671 --> 00:58:22,831
Don't worry.

829
00:58:23,173 --> 00:58:24,504
Not so fast.

830
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:35,310
Be careful.

831
00:58:35,819 --> 00:58:37,411
I will.

832
00:58:47,831 --> 00:58:48,923
Oh, no!

833
00:58:51,301 --> 00:58:52,290
Grandma!

834
00:58:54,037 --> 00:58:56,335
Luke, what happened? Are you all right?

835
00:58:57,807 --> 00:58:59,331
Why don't you answer?

836
00:59:02,879 --> 00:59:03,971
Down, cat.

837
00:59:04,447 --> 00:59:05,436
No, cat.

838
00:59:08,017 --> 00:59:09,814
Grandma, help!

839
00:59:14,357 --> 00:59:15,449
Down, cat!

840
00:59:15,558 --> 00:59:17,549
No. Go, cat.

841
00:59:19,229 --> 00:59:20,662
Grandma!

842
00:59:21,030 --> 00:59:22,395
Get away. Help!

843
00:59:22,832 --> 00:59:25,630
Get him away, Grandma! Help, Grandma!

844
00:59:27,370 --> 00:59:28,598
Grandma, help!

845
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:31,199
Puss!

846
00:59:31,274 --> 00:59:33,936
Grandma, come on! Do something!

847
00:59:34,244 --> 00:59:35,711
Get it, cat.

848
00:59:35,845 --> 00:59:38,075
Cat, puss.

849
00:59:38,348 --> 00:59:40,043
Come on. Take it.

850
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:45,187
Keep him there, Grandma.

851
00:59:45,255 --> 00:59:46,483
Come on, you little kitten.

852
00:59:47,156 --> 00:59:48,453
Come on, pussy.

853
00:59:48,658 --> 00:59:49,920
Keep him busy.

854
00:59:51,361 --> 00:59:53,090
Here. Take it.

855
00:59:58,501 --> 00:59:59,490
Come on.

856
00:59:59,669 --> 01:00:01,728
Take it, you silly cat.

857
01:00:02,305 --> 01:00:03,829
Don't let him in.

858
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:05,298
Puss.

859
01:00:06,142 --> 01:00:07,268
Here.

860
01:00:23,359 --> 01:00:24,656
Hang on, tail.

861
01:00:31,501 --> 01:00:33,594
Come on, formula. Where are you?

862
01:00:59,429 --> 01:01:02,421
It has been unforgettable, Mr. Jenkins.

863
01:01:02,498 --> 01:01:03,988
My pleasure, madam.

864
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:06,361
What a stimulating conversation
it has been.

865
01:01:06,436 --> 01:01:09,098
It's not every day that one meets a lady
of such quality...

866
01:01:09,439 --> 01:01:10,838
...and compassion.

867
01:01:26,422 --> 01:01:28,049
It's got to be somewhere up here.

868
01:01:28,358 --> 01:01:29,882
It's just got to be.

869
01:01:38,401 --> 01:01:39,333
Oh, man.

870
01:01:45,808 --> 01:01:47,469
We've got it, Grandma.

871
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:53,376
Did you realize that was Bruno's father?

872
01:01:53,983 --> 01:01:55,109
Dreadful man.

873
01:01:55,184 --> 01:01:56,879
It was an act of mercy.

874
01:01:56,953 --> 01:01:59,387
The child shall never grow up
to be like his father.

875
01:02:01,991 --> 01:02:03,618
- Thanks.
- Liebchen?

876
01:02:08,297 --> 01:02:09,594
Liebchen?

877
01:02:18,041 --> 01:02:19,303
What is this?

878
01:02:21,010 --> 01:02:22,443
I'm so sorry.

879
01:02:22,512 --> 01:02:24,343
- I dropped my knitting.
- You!

880
01:02:26,416 --> 01:02:28,884
I'm knitting for my grandson.

881
01:02:28,985 --> 01:02:30,612
Have you seen him?

882
01:02:30,686 --> 01:02:31,675
No, no.

883
01:02:32,221 --> 01:02:33,279
Come, Liebchen.

884
01:02:33,356 --> 01:02:36,587
I'm dreadfully sorry. I do apologize.

885
01:02:36,726 --> 01:02:38,353
That's quite all right.

886
01:02:38,628 --> 01:02:40,994
If I see your grandson, I will...

887
01:02:43,032 --> 01:02:44,829
I will turn him into a mouse.

888
01:02:44,901 --> 01:02:48,064
And you, meddling old woman,
I'll deal with later.

889
01:02:55,545 --> 01:02:57,843
- Room 208.
- I hope we're not the first.

890
01:02:58,881 --> 01:03:00,280
Miss Ernst.

891
01:03:01,717 --> 01:03:02,809
Who is it?

892
01:03:02,885 --> 01:03:05,581
You told them to come up after the drinks.

893
01:03:06,189 --> 01:03:07,816
All right, let them in.

894
01:03:14,764 --> 01:03:15,856
Come in.

895
01:03:16,332 --> 01:03:18,391
You were wonderful this afternoon.

896
01:03:23,139 --> 01:03:24,731
You bad cat, Liebchen.

897
01:03:40,623 --> 01:03:43,319
So, when do you think
they'd implement it?

898
01:03:43,392 --> 01:03:45,292
First of the year, I suppose.

899
01:03:45,928 --> 01:03:47,987
This is a very pleasant hotel.

900
01:03:48,898 --> 01:03:51,731
The question is:
Would you like to work with them?

901
01:04:12,488 --> 01:04:14,513
I've got the formula!

902
01:04:14,824 --> 01:04:15,916
Thank God.

903
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:19,060
Darling, I was so worried.

904
01:04:19,128 --> 01:04:21,824
There's 500 doses in this one little bottle.

905
01:04:22,298 --> 01:04:25,233
It's enough to change all the witches
in this hotel.

906
01:04:26,202 --> 01:04:27,499
Where's Bruno?

907
01:04:28,237 --> 01:04:30,398
There's some jolly good grapes here.

908
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:32,268
What's happening?

909
01:04:32,341 --> 01:04:34,172
Nothing until dinnertime.

910
01:04:34,810 --> 01:04:37,142
We've got to get you back to your parents.

911
01:04:37,213 --> 01:04:38,908
What time is it?

912
01:04:39,482 --> 01:04:40,346
7:00.

913
01:04:40,416 --> 01:04:42,008
They'll be in the bar.

914
01:04:42,118 --> 01:04:44,586
A sherry and a large malt whiskey
and soda...

915
01:04:44,654 --> 01:04:46,019
...at 7:00 sharp.

916
01:04:46,589 --> 01:04:48,113
It gives you an appetite.

917
01:04:48,191 --> 01:04:49,180
Does it?

918
01:04:49,725 --> 01:04:50,817
Come on.

919
01:04:51,094 --> 01:04:54,461
Into my handbag, both of you.

920
01:04:54,898 --> 01:04:57,298
This is going to be difficult.

921
01:04:57,968 --> 01:04:58,900
I'm full.

922
01:04:58,969 --> 01:05:01,437
We've got to get to the kitchen quickly.

923
01:05:02,239 --> 01:05:03,467
That tickles.

924
01:05:06,310 --> 01:05:07,868
Is that them?

925
01:05:07,945 --> 01:05:09,537
Yes. Listen, Grandma.

926
01:05:09,980 --> 01:05:11,447
Maybe we ought to...

927
01:05:11,915 --> 01:05:13,382
No, wait! Listen.

928
01:05:16,954 --> 01:05:18,251
Don't drown it.

929
01:05:18,956 --> 01:05:20,924
- Sorry.
- Look what you've done!

930
01:05:20,991 --> 01:05:22,481
She was drowning it.

931
01:05:22,793 --> 01:05:25,523
Are you Mr. And Mrs. Jenkins?

932
01:05:25,963 --> 01:05:28,431
Hole in one. What can we do for you?

933
01:05:28,699 --> 01:05:32,226
I'd like to have a word with you
about your son.

934
01:05:32,869 --> 01:05:34,200
Sit down.

935
01:05:36,006 --> 01:05:38,372
What's the little tyke been up to now?

936
01:05:38,675 --> 01:05:40,666
Raiding the kitchen, I suppose.

937
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:45,412
If we could go somewhere more private.

938
01:05:45,916 --> 01:05:46,905
Private?

939
01:05:47,818 --> 01:05:49,615
Well, it is rather a...

940
01:05:50,053 --> 01:05:51,577
...personal matter.

941
01:05:51,755 --> 01:05:54,019
Look, Mrs. Whatever your name is...

942
01:05:54,224 --> 01:05:57,421
...if Bruno has broken a window
or smashed your spectacles...

943
01:05:57,494 --> 01:06:00,224
...I'll pay for it, but we're not budging.

944
01:06:00,297 --> 01:06:01,696
We always sit at this table.

945
01:06:01,798 --> 01:06:05,529
Where is Bruno anyway?
Tell him to come and see me.

946
01:06:06,370 --> 01:06:08,895
He is here already.

947
01:06:09,239 --> 01:06:10,501
What?

948
01:06:10,574 --> 01:06:11,939
In my handbag.

949
01:06:13,010 --> 01:06:16,104
Your son has suffered a mishap.

950
01:06:16,346 --> 01:06:19,543
He has been drastically altered.

951
01:06:20,117 --> 01:06:21,345
Altered?

952
01:06:21,718 --> 01:06:23,447
What do you mean, "altered"?

953
01:06:23,553 --> 01:06:26,420
I'm trying to tell you as gently as possible.

954
01:06:27,124 --> 01:06:30,491
My grandson saw them doing it to him.

955
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:32,152
Saw who doing what?

956
01:06:33,497 --> 01:06:38,366
Saw the witches turn him into a mouse.

957
01:06:41,305 --> 01:06:42,670
Are you crackers?

958
01:06:45,342 --> 01:06:48,743
Tell the manager to throw this nutcase
out of the hotel.

959
01:06:48,812 --> 01:06:50,746
You need a funny farm, you do.

960
01:06:51,815 --> 01:06:53,544
Tell them, Bruno.

961
01:06:55,819 --> 01:06:57,047
It's a mouse!

962
01:06:57,354 --> 01:07:00,585
I can't stand them! Get it away from here!

963
01:07:00,691 --> 01:07:03,717
It is Bruno. Tell them, Bruno.

964
01:07:03,794 --> 01:07:05,659
Get out of here! How dare you!

965
01:07:05,729 --> 01:07:07,993
- Tell them, Bruno.
- Get out of here.

966
01:07:09,633 --> 01:07:11,032
It's me, Mum.

967
01:07:11,101 --> 01:07:14,662
Out, before I call the police,
you barmy old loony.

968
01:07:14,871 --> 01:07:17,203
I don't think they recognize me.

969
01:07:17,407 --> 01:07:18,374
Push off!

970
01:07:18,442 --> 01:07:21,138
Never come back, you stupid old witch!

971
01:07:21,211 --> 01:07:22,974
I did my best, Bruno.

972
01:07:23,046 --> 01:07:24,980
Don't worry, dear. She's gone.

973
01:07:27,517 --> 01:07:30,315
Evening, madam,
I'm just popping in to turn down your bed.

974
01:07:31,254 --> 01:07:32,778
How is the room service here?

975
01:07:32,856 --> 01:07:34,448
- Diabolical.
- Good.

976
01:07:34,825 --> 01:07:36,816
How do you know that woman upstairs?

977
01:07:36,893 --> 01:07:39,453
Come along. Walk downstairs.
The lift is out of order.

978
01:07:39,529 --> 01:07:40,826
I suppose it must be.

979
01:07:41,598 --> 01:07:44,829
- It's a five-course meal.
- Good, I'm rather hungry.

980
01:09:01,611 --> 01:09:04,079
I'd like to go home, that's what I'd like.

981
01:09:04,614 --> 01:09:06,809
- What are you doing here?
- The banquet.

982
01:09:06,883 --> 01:09:09,010
No! Go to your room and prepare for...

983
01:09:10,387 --> 01:09:13,515
...tomorrow's flight.
Yes, have a good flight.

984
01:09:13,690 --> 01:09:15,180
But it's our banquet!

985
01:09:15,258 --> 01:09:17,692
You are not here to enjoy yourself.

986
01:09:17,761 --> 01:09:19,456
You are here as my staff.

987
01:09:19,529 --> 01:09:21,861
Go to your room! Now!

988
01:09:22,699 --> 01:09:24,326
Ladies.

989
01:09:26,970 --> 01:09:28,403
I quit!

990
01:09:41,852 --> 01:09:45,049
I can't go through with it.
We could go home, yes?

991
01:09:45,121 --> 01:09:47,385
Grandma, if we don't try...

992
01:09:47,591 --> 01:09:51,721
...every mother and father
in England will lose their kids.

993
01:09:52,195 --> 01:09:53,958
- I know.
- We must do it.

994
01:09:54,030 --> 01:09:57,727
8:03. Now, 8:15 exactly.

995
01:09:57,868 --> 01:10:00,496
- I'll remember.
- I'm so terrified.

996
01:10:00,904 --> 01:10:02,428
Grandma, now!

997
01:10:05,041 --> 01:10:06,702
No, madam. Please, no.

998
01:10:06,776 --> 01:10:08,744
I'm sorry. This isn't the dining room.

999
01:10:08,812 --> 01:10:10,780
I am sorry, truly.

1000
01:10:10,981 --> 01:10:13,848
The guests are not permitted, madam.

1001
01:10:13,950 --> 01:10:16,111
I am sorry, but...

1002
01:10:53,023 --> 01:10:54,149
One moment.

1003
01:11:05,602 --> 01:11:08,628
How is the cress soup
for the children's charity group?

1004
01:11:11,074 --> 01:11:12,371
A soup!

1005
01:11:13,243 --> 01:11:14,870
Very good, but no more salt.

1006
01:11:14,945 --> 01:11:16,105
No more?

1007
01:11:20,383 --> 01:11:22,442
What are you doing?

1008
01:11:22,886 --> 01:11:25,252
Are you a murderer or a chef?

1009
01:11:42,973 --> 01:11:44,440
They're everywhere.

1010
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:52,339
Table 5 says the veal's too tough.

1011
01:11:52,415 --> 01:11:54,576
I will take care of this personally.

1012
01:11:59,789 --> 01:12:01,256
Chef!

1013
01:12:02,225 --> 01:12:05,160
The R.S.P.C.C. Party all want soup.

1014
01:12:05,495 --> 01:12:07,190
That's 87 for watercress.

1015
01:12:07,263 --> 01:12:09,823
Debby, bring the soup tureens.

1016
01:12:09,899 --> 01:12:12,891
<i>He'll adore it now.
A magic touch, n'est-ce pas?</i>

1017
01:12:40,263 --> 01:12:42,561
I'll check the soup before it's served.

1018
01:12:53,076 --> 01:12:55,271
She's eating the soup.

1019
01:13:02,619 --> 01:13:04,109
I'll see you later.

1020
01:13:04,888 --> 01:13:06,719
We're short-staffed tonight.

1021
01:13:11,695 --> 01:13:13,526
I may be a little late.

1022
01:13:14,030 --> 01:13:15,361
I can wait.

1023
01:13:27,110 --> 01:13:28,441
What is it?

1024
01:13:40,156 --> 01:13:41,214
Now.

1025
01:13:46,863 --> 01:13:48,228
A mouse!

1026
01:13:54,237 --> 01:13:58,071
There's a mouse running around
in my bloody underpants!

1027
01:13:58,141 --> 01:14:00,735
For goodness sake. Out of the way.

1028
01:14:02,579 --> 01:14:04,513
Get it out! Somebody help me!

1029
01:14:04,581 --> 01:14:06,412
Take your trousers off, you idiot!

1030
01:14:06,483 --> 01:14:07,973
Take your pants off.

1031
01:14:08,752 --> 01:14:09,844
Give me that.

1032
01:14:09,919 --> 01:14:12,387
Somebody get it out before it bites me!

1033
01:14:15,291 --> 01:14:16,417
I got to get out of here.

1034
01:14:16,493 --> 01:14:17,983
Somebody get it out!

1035
01:14:20,263 --> 01:14:21,423
I saw it.

1036
01:14:21,631 --> 01:14:22,791
Do you see it?

1037
01:14:22,866 --> 01:14:23,992
Nothing.

1038
01:14:25,401 --> 01:14:26,993
There's nothing much in there.

1039
01:14:29,239 --> 01:14:31,708
A lot of fuss about nothing. Mice.

1040
01:14:35,246 --> 01:14:36,679
It's gone.

1041
01:14:54,865 --> 01:14:55,854
Yes?

1042
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:57,599
What kind of soup is that?

1043
01:14:57,668 --> 01:14:59,761
That is the cress soup.

1044
01:14:59,970 --> 01:15:03,497
If they're all having cress soup,
I'll have the cress soup.

1045
01:15:03,574 --> 01:15:06,509
That soup is specially made for their party.

1046
01:15:06,710 --> 01:15:09,577
The soup on the menu tonight
is cock-a-leekie...

1047
01:15:09,814 --> 01:15:11,748
...and very nice it is, too.

1048
01:15:11,982 --> 01:15:13,677
But I don't want cock-a-leekie.

1049
01:15:13,751 --> 01:15:16,185
I don't like cock-a-leekie. I like cress.

1050
01:15:16,253 --> 01:15:18,221
So take that back to the kitchen...

1051
01:15:18,289 --> 01:15:21,190
...and tell the chef there's one more order
for cress soup.

1052
01:15:21,258 --> 01:15:22,623
There's a laddie.

1053
01:15:39,009 --> 01:15:40,476
What's that then?

1054
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:58,121
Don't touch it! It's in the soup!

1055
01:15:58,262 --> 01:15:59,559
Don't touch the soup!

1056
01:15:59,630 --> 01:16:00,858
Child!

1057
01:16:02,566 --> 01:16:03,863
Good.

1058
01:16:04,802 --> 01:16:06,099
Hurry up.

1059
01:16:11,942 --> 01:16:13,466
Nearly 8:15.

1060
01:16:17,414 --> 01:16:19,314
No. I can't believe it.

1061
01:16:19,550 --> 01:16:20,517
Dear me!

1062
01:16:20,584 --> 01:16:22,347
No, madam, please.

1063
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:24,051
<i>Just a moment.</i>

1064
01:16:34,899 --> 01:16:36,594
8:15. I made it!

1065
01:16:40,304 --> 01:16:41,464
One more...

1066
01:16:42,740 --> 01:16:45,038
...cress soup, table 9.

1067
01:17:19,877 --> 01:17:20,969
Hi, Bruno.

1068
01:17:23,013 --> 01:17:24,776
Lovely, isn't it?

1069
01:17:24,982 --> 01:17:26,074
Red.

1070
01:17:26,183 --> 01:17:27,150
Yes.

1071
01:17:27,584 --> 01:17:28,573
Red.

1072
01:17:33,824 --> 01:17:36,349
I didn't want to be one of them anyway.

1073
01:17:40,397 --> 01:17:42,388
I'll bring you your main course.

1074
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:45,698
- Well?
- I put it in the soup.

1075
01:17:45,769 --> 01:17:48,101
- The whole bottle?
- Every drop.

1076
01:17:48,172 --> 01:17:49,639
You angel.

1077
01:17:50,941 --> 01:17:52,306
You're bleeding.

1078
01:17:52,376 --> 01:17:55,834
A cook tried to cut off my tail
with a carving knife.

1079
01:17:56,146 --> 01:17:58,808
Look! The Grand High Witch
is eating the soup!

1080
01:18:02,586 --> 01:18:04,383
They all are.

1081
01:18:13,263 --> 01:18:14,594
Another roll, sir?

1082
01:18:14,665 --> 01:18:15,893
No, thanks.

1083
01:18:16,667 --> 01:18:18,032
I'd like some...

1084
01:18:21,338 --> 01:18:23,465
I'd like some black pepper, please.

1085
01:18:23,941 --> 01:18:25,533
- My God!
- What?

1086
01:18:26,076 --> 01:18:29,409
Bruno's father
is about to eat the soup, too.

1087
01:18:29,780 --> 01:18:30,940
- Stop him!
- Quick!

1088
01:18:31,015 --> 01:18:34,382
I agree, dear, it's been a nightmare.

1089
01:18:35,185 --> 01:18:36,982
At least we got some cress soup.

1090
01:18:37,955 --> 01:18:39,320
Don't touch it!

1091
01:18:39,857 --> 01:18:43,054
I told you she was a loony.
She's an absolute nutter!

1092
01:18:43,594 --> 01:18:45,494
Look at my bloody soup!

1093
01:18:45,729 --> 01:18:47,993
And all that stuff about Bruno!

1094
01:18:48,098 --> 01:18:50,931
Bruno has been turned into...

1095
01:18:51,001 --> 01:18:53,492
He has not been turned into a...

1096
01:18:53,570 --> 01:18:55,629
Yes, I have. Hello, Dad.

1097
01:19:03,247 --> 01:19:06,375
Don't worry, Dad. It isn't all bad...

1098
01:19:07,251 --> 01:19:09,446
...just so long as the cat doesn't get me.

1099
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:10,680
Bruno.

1100
01:19:10,754 --> 01:19:13,382
No more school, no more homework.

1101
01:19:13,657 --> 01:19:15,750
I'll live in the kitchen cupboard.

1102
01:19:17,861 --> 01:19:19,351
This is a trick.

1103
01:19:19,797 --> 01:19:21,162
It's that whiskey.

1104
01:19:22,066 --> 01:19:22,998
Hello, Mum.

1105
01:19:25,102 --> 01:19:28,037
Would you like to know
who did this to Bruno?

1106
01:19:36,413 --> 01:19:37,641
It's working.

1107
01:19:47,024 --> 01:19:48,218
Let go of me!

1108
01:19:52,463 --> 01:19:55,694
<i>My Formula 86! Give me that spoon!</i>

1109
01:19:57,201 --> 01:19:59,192
That woman over there.

1110
01:20:01,805 --> 01:20:05,468
She is the Grand High Witch.

1111
01:20:08,679 --> 01:20:11,580
Grandma,
she needs more time to become a...

1112
01:20:13,984 --> 01:20:16,544
She did it to Bruno...

1113
01:20:17,888 --> 01:20:22,848
...and thousands of other children
before him.

1114
01:20:25,129 --> 01:20:26,426
Good evening.

1115
01:20:26,630 --> 01:20:29,121
You're doomed, old woman!

1116
01:20:29,900 --> 01:20:31,800
You're doomed forever!

1117
01:20:31,869 --> 01:20:33,200
It must work.

1118
01:20:33,303 --> 01:20:34,327
You.

1119
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:44,347
This is it, Bruno.

1120
01:20:55,058 --> 01:20:56,116
Come on!

1121
01:20:56,393 --> 01:20:57,826
Get the mice!

1122
01:21:05,402 --> 01:21:06,835
One is a witch.

1123
01:21:07,871 --> 01:21:11,602
The most evil and appalling woman
in the world.

1124
01:21:12,075 --> 01:21:13,804
A loathsome...

1125
01:21:14,311 --> 01:21:16,711
...hideous disgrace!

1126
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:18,513
Yeah, Grandma!

1127
01:21:18,682 --> 01:21:23,346
I'm not finished with you yet, old woman!

1128
01:21:23,620 --> 01:21:25,178
Next time!

1129
01:21:26,456 --> 01:21:28,117
No next time.

1130
01:21:28,258 --> 01:21:31,853
This time it's your turn.

1131
01:21:44,107 --> 01:21:45,699
Herbert, do something!

1132
01:21:45,776 --> 01:21:47,505
It's in your garment.

1133
01:21:47,578 --> 01:21:49,273
- Good night.
- Good night.

1134
01:21:52,516 --> 01:21:55,280
Get that brown one! No, the other one!

1135
01:21:57,421 --> 01:21:58,786
Look, it's her.

1136
01:22:00,290 --> 01:22:02,087
Get away from me!

1137
01:22:02,159 --> 01:22:03,956
Don't let her get away.

1138
01:22:04,528 --> 01:22:05,517
Get away!

1139
01:22:10,734 --> 01:22:12,429
Get me out of here!

1140
01:22:15,973 --> 01:22:18,203
Get out of my hotel!

1141
01:22:20,611 --> 01:22:21,805
Mr. Stringer.

1142
01:22:23,747 --> 01:22:27,478
There's an especially impetuous one
over there, under the water jug.

1143
01:22:27,551 --> 01:22:28,483
Thank you.

1144
01:22:28,552 --> 01:22:30,452
It's a pleasure.

1145
01:22:31,355 --> 01:22:32,447
Get away from me!

1146
01:22:32,522 --> 01:22:34,854
I tell you, get away from me!

1147
01:22:36,727 --> 01:22:38,354
Get away from me!

1148
01:22:51,341 --> 01:22:54,003
My mum's not very crazy about mice.

1149
01:22:54,311 --> 01:22:55,903
So I see.

1150
01:22:57,848 --> 01:22:59,247
Here is Bruno.

1151
01:23:00,284 --> 01:23:02,752
- Thank you.
- He needs to go on a diet.

1152
01:23:03,787 --> 01:23:06,221
Hi, Dad. Hi, Mum.

1153
01:23:06,290 --> 01:23:08,281
Stop it, dear. Stop it.

1154
01:23:08,692 --> 01:23:10,455
This is our Bruno.

1155
01:23:11,795 --> 01:23:14,525
Don't cry, Mum. You'll get used to me.

1156
01:23:17,167 --> 01:23:18,794
<i>Just a minute, Grandma.</i>

1157
01:23:18,902 --> 01:23:20,096
'Bye, Bruno.

1158
01:23:20,470 --> 01:23:21,528
'Bye.

1159
01:23:22,205 --> 01:23:23,934
Excuse me.

1160
01:23:26,209 --> 01:23:28,507
You always wanted me to lose weight.

1161
01:23:28,578 --> 01:23:30,671
Well, look at me now.

1162
01:23:39,222 --> 01:23:42,316
There. But I still don't understand.

1163
01:23:42,392 --> 01:23:43,757
I won't be long.

1164
01:23:50,334 --> 01:23:51,699
Come on, this way.

1165
01:23:51,802 --> 01:23:53,702
Right to the main dining room.

1166
01:23:54,137 --> 01:23:55,126
Hurry up.

1167
01:23:55,205 --> 01:23:57,036
- Your taxi, madam.
- Good-bye.

1168
01:24:24,102 --> 01:24:25,501
Put it down, Bill.

1169
01:24:26,037 --> 01:24:27,766
- That's it.
- You all right?

1170
01:24:30,575 --> 01:24:32,372
- Can you manage?
- I'm fine.

1171
01:24:32,443 --> 01:24:34,172
Look out. There's a step.

1172
01:24:37,548 --> 01:24:38,981
- Mrs. Evershim?
- Yes.

1173
01:24:39,050 --> 01:24:41,177
- There's a trunk for you.
- A trunk?

1174
01:24:42,086 --> 01:24:44,554
- Will you sign for it?
- Yes, all right.

1175
01:24:45,123 --> 01:24:46,283
Come in.

1176
01:24:47,692 --> 01:24:49,626
Great! It's arrived.

1177
01:24:49,994 --> 01:24:52,258
Don't open it yet. Wait for me.

1178
01:24:52,563 --> 01:24:54,394
Put it down there. That'll do fine.

1179
01:24:54,465 --> 01:24:55,830
All right, ma'am.

1180
01:24:56,267 --> 01:24:57,359
That's it.

1181
01:24:58,936 --> 01:25:00,096
Here I come.

1182
01:25:01,572 --> 01:25:02,937
Thank you.

1183
01:25:03,007 --> 01:25:05,999
I still have no idea who it could be from.

1184
01:25:06,778 --> 01:25:08,973
This is really gonna surprise you.

1185
01:25:11,916 --> 01:25:12,974
Open it.

1186
01:25:13,785 --> 01:25:15,514
- But what is it?
- Open it.

1187
01:25:17,722 --> 01:25:18,916
Money!

1188
01:25:20,224 --> 01:25:22,658
I saw it in the Grand High Witch's room.

1189
01:25:22,727 --> 01:25:25,696
I figured we could use it
when we go to America.

1190
01:25:27,965 --> 01:25:29,193
America?

1191
01:25:29,901 --> 01:25:31,801
We've got to go home because...

1192
01:25:32,437 --> 01:25:33,426
Look!

1193
01:25:35,907 --> 01:25:37,636
It was the Grand High Witch's.

1194
01:25:37,708 --> 01:25:40,905
It has the name and address
of every witch in America.

1195
01:25:48,453 --> 01:25:50,648
You are a genius.

1196
01:25:56,127 --> 01:26:00,564
"It doesn't matter who you are
and what you are

1197
01:26:00,631 --> 01:26:02,963
"As long as somebody loves you"

1198
01:26:04,068 --> 01:26:04,864
Luke.

1199
01:26:04,936 --> 01:26:06,426
What a day.

1200
01:26:07,438 --> 01:26:10,134
Perhaps we could find a good witch...

1201
01:26:10,208 --> 01:26:12,233
...to turn you back into my grandson.

1202
01:26:12,310 --> 01:26:15,507
I'll never be able to drive a real car, will I?

1203
01:26:16,047 --> 01:26:17,309
I don't know.

1204
01:26:17,448 --> 01:26:19,245
How long do mice live?

1205
01:26:19,550 --> 01:26:23,077
I hope we have time to take on
those American witches.

1206
01:26:24,055 --> 01:26:25,386
Shall we go to New York?

1207
01:26:25,456 --> 01:26:27,287
I've never been to New York.

1208
01:26:31,729 --> 01:26:33,287
Can we travel by ship?

1209
01:26:33,965 --> 01:26:35,660
First class.

1210
01:26:35,933 --> 01:26:37,264
The best cabin.

1211
01:26:37,535 --> 01:26:39,799
The best of everything.

1212
01:26:43,174 --> 01:26:44,801
Good night, Grandma.

1213
01:26:46,043 --> 01:26:47,408
Good night, Luke.

1214
01:26:59,657 --> 01:27:02,353
I really am happy to be a mouse,
you know.

1215
01:27:04,328 --> 01:27:06,762
I know, my darling.

1216
01:27:53,911 --> 01:27:55,173
Grandma!

1217
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:58,209
Grandma, what's happening?

1218
01:28:40,791 --> 01:28:44,090
Off you go, back home to Luke.

1219
01:28:47,465 --> 01:28:49,330
Look, they're back!

1220
01:28:56,974 --> 01:28:59,067
Don't forget Bruno!

1221
01:29:00,067 --> 01:29:10,067
