[ Josh ]
In the days before the event,

2
00:00:53,367 --> 00:00:58,327
he had the whole world
wondering if he would show up.

3
00:01:07,315 --> 00:01:08,748
while he napped

4
00:01:08,816 --> 00:01:11,842
or took walks
and ate sandwiches.

5
00:01:13,321 --> 00:01:14,754
Henry Kissinger called

6
00:01:14,822 --> 00:01:17,814
and asked him to go
for his country's honor.

7
00:01:20,261 --> 00:01:22,491
Soon after arriving,

8
00:01:22,563 --> 00:01:23,996
he offended the Icelanders

9
00:01:24,065 --> 00:01:25,999
by calling their country
inadequate

10
00:01:26,067 --> 00:01:29,867
because they had
no bowling alleys.

11
00:01:29,937 --> 00:01:32,599
He complained
about the TV cameras,

12
00:01:32,673 --> 00:01:34,106
about the lighting,

13
00:01:34,175 --> 00:01:36,109
about
the table and chairs,

14
00:01:36,177 --> 00:01:39,613
and the contrast of
the squares on the board.

15
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,117
His hotel room, he said,
Had too nice a view.

16
00:01:44,185 --> 00:01:48,087
None of this had anything
to do with chess, of course...

17
00:01:48,156 --> 00:01:50,716
or maybe it did.

18
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:52,418
If he won,

19
00:01:52,493 --> 00:01:56,259
he'd be the first
American world champion in history.

20
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:57,763
If he lost,

21
00:01:57,832 --> 00:02:01,268
he'd just be another
patzer from Brooklyn.

22

On the 40th move
Of the 21st game,

23
00:02:06,307 --> 00:02:09,242
he countered
Spassky's bishop to king-6

24
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,676
with a pawn to rook-4.

25
00:02:12,747 --> 00:02:14,840
And it was all over.

00:23:10,567 --> 00:23:13,035
I work for a newspaper.
I wanted--

340
00:23:13,103 --> 00:23:16,129
I don't know
where Bobby Fischer is.

341
00:23:19,309 --> 00:23:22,540
I was talking to the guy
who writes the chess column.

342
00:23:22,613 --> 00:23:27,050
He told me I could find
Bruce Pandolfini here.

343
00:23:27,117 --> 00:23:30,052
I'm looking for
a teacher for my son.

344
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,553
I don't teach anymore.

345
00:23:31,622 --> 00:23:34,420
He was sure
that you did.

346
00:23:35,626 --> 00:23:37,491
I don't.

347
00:23:54,144 --> 00:23:55,577
Come on, Josh.

348
00:23:55,646 --> 00:23:57,739
Just a second.

349
00:25:18,595 --> 00:25:19,857
Thanks.

350
00:25:23,367 --> 00:25:24,800
What was the score?

351
00:25:24,868 --> 00:25:26,028
33 to 8.

352
00:25:26,103 --> 00:25:28,537
33 to 8?
What did you do?

353
00:25:28,605 --> 00:25:32,006
3 home runs, 3 triples,
and 2 singles.

354
00:25:32,075 --> 00:25:34,805
I almost had
4 home runs,

355
00:25:34,878 --> 00:25:36,675
but I slipped coming home
from third.

356
00:25:36,747 --> 00:25:39,113
I ain't playing
this game.

357
00:25:40,617 --> 00:25:42,881
Oh, caught you looking.

358
00:25:42,953 --> 00:25:44,215
You want some smoke?

359
00:25:44,287 --> 00:25:46,050
Never play defensive.
Always attack.

360
00:25:46,123 --> 00:25:48,057
Even when you retreat,
you attack.

361
00:25:48,125 --> 00:25:49,057
You understand?

362
00:25:49,126 --> 00:25:50,093
Yeah.

363
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,287
There you go.
Now you're playing chess.

364
00:25:52,362 --> 00:25:53,852
That's right.
Make him run.

365
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:56,728
Got me in trouble.
I'm on the run.

366
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,735
What can I do?
Where can I go?

367
00:25:59,803 --> 00:26:00,667
Young Fischer.

368
00:26:00,737 --> 00:26:01,999
Come after me.

369
00:26:02,072 --> 00:26:03,505
There you go.

370
00:26:03,573 --> 00:26:04,699
Outstanding.

371
00:26:04,775 --> 00:26:05,707
Outstanding.

372
00:26:05,776 --> 00:26:07,505
Nothing I can do.

373
00:26:07,577 --> 00:26:09,966
I'm in major trouble,
major trouble.

374
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,830
I got big problems now.

375
00:26:12,903 --> 00:26:14,336
[ Katya ]
What's this?

376
00:26:14,404 --> 00:26:15,962
This goes like this.

377
00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:17,472
And this
goes like this.

378
00:26:17,541 --> 00:26:19,771
And this
can go over pieces.

379
00:26:19,843 --> 00:26:21,777
That piece
should go over here.

380
00:26:21,845 --> 00:26:23,676
And the pawn go--

381
00:26:24,848 --> 00:26:26,042
And the pawns--

382
00:26:26,116 --> 00:26:28,050
the pawns can
take like this.

383
00:26:28,118 --> 00:26:29,551
This is a pawn...

384
00:26:29,619 --> 00:26:31,985
You sneak in here again,
Katya?

385
00:26:32,055 --> 00:26:32,987
Yeah.

386
00:26:33,056 --> 00:26:35,889
It's way past
your bedtime.

387
00:26:35,959 --> 00:26:38,689
Say good night
to your brother.

388
00:26:38,762 --> 00:26:39,694
Good night.

389
00:26:42,065 --> 00:26:43,089
There.

390
00:26:45,569 --> 00:26:47,002
Mom?

391
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:48,230
Yeah?

392
00:26:49,573 --> 00:26:52,007
Does Vinnie
sleep in the park?

393
00:26:53,577 --> 00:26:56,910
I have no idea
where he lives.

394
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,345
Well, I was thinking...

395
00:26:58,415 --> 00:27:01,646
maybe he could sleep
in my top bunk instead.

396
00:27:01,718 --> 00:27:04,653
Then when I get old enough
to sleep in it,

397
00:27:04,721 --> 00:27:06,655
he could sleep
down here.

398
00:27:08,024 --> 00:27:10,720
You have a good heart.

399
00:27:12,596 --> 00:27:16,225
And that's the most important thing
in the world.

400
00:27:22,739 --> 00:27:23,967
Good night.

401
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,268
Good night, Mom.

402
00:27:57,574 --> 00:27:59,508
Glad you could
make it.

403
00:28:05,849 --> 00:28:07,282
So how's it going?

404
00:28:08,351 --> 00:28:09,283
All right.

405
00:28:09,352 --> 00:28:11,286
Great.

406
00:28:11,354 --> 00:28:12,412
That's great.

407
00:28:13,523 --> 00:28:15,991
So what do you think?

408
00:28:16,059 --> 00:28:18,459
Have you ever been
to a tournament before?

409
00:28:18,528 --> 00:28:19,460
No.

410
00:28:19,529 --> 00:28:21,121
Ah. You're in luck then.

411
00:28:21,197 --> 00:28:23,631
This is one
of the most prestigious.

412
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:26,294
The talent gathered here's
the strongest in the country.

413
00:28:26,369 --> 00:28:28,064
Everybody's here.

414
00:28:28,138 --> 00:28:30,800
Joel Benjamin--
former U.S. Champion,

415
00:28:30,874 --> 00:28:34,776
among the six highest-rated players
in the country.

416
00:28:37,213 --> 00:28:41,479
The man in the corner's
Roman Dzindzichashvili--

417
00:28:41,551 --> 00:28:42,984
two-time U.S. Champion.

418
00:28:43,053 --> 00:28:45,487
A few years ago,
he was ranked

419
00:28:45,555 --> 00:28:48,888
among the top 1 0 players
of the world.

420
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:55,993
Asa Hoffman.

421
00:28:56,066 --> 00:28:58,000
He's the son
of two lawyers.

422
00:28:58,068 --> 00:29:00,002
He grew up
on Park Avenue,

423
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:02,095
went to Columbia
and Horace Mann

424
00:29:02,172 --> 00:29:04,436
before dropping out
to play chess full-time.

425
00:29:04,507 --> 00:29:07,271
He plays about 200 chess tournaments
a year.

426
00:29:07,343 --> 00:29:08,935
Asa.

427
00:29:09,012 --> 00:29:09,944
Asa.

428
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:16,648
How much do you make
at the tournaments altogether...

429
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,153
about $2,000 a year?

430
00:29:18,221 --> 00:29:21,156
Look at that. I got him thinking.
I got him thinking.

431
00:29:21,224 --> 00:29:24,284
Maybe I can win a pawn.

432
00:29:32,535 --> 00:29:34,969
Clearly, you
had me come here

433
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:37,563
so I could
see all this.

434
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:41,076
But if you really
wanted me to say no

435
00:29:41,144 --> 00:29:43,078
to letting my son play,

436
00:29:43,146 --> 00:29:44,579
you wouldn't
have bothered.

437
00:29:45,882 --> 00:29:49,545
You want me to think
you want me to say no,

438
00:29:49,619 --> 00:29:52,486
but you actually...

439
00:29:52,555 --> 00:29:54,648
want me to say yes.

440
00:29:56,826 --> 00:29:59,226
You have no idea
what I want.

441
00:30:02,065 --> 00:30:04,761
What is chess,
do you think?

442
00:30:04,834 --> 00:30:07,769
Those who play for fun,
or not at all,

443
00:30:07,837 --> 00:30:09,771
dismiss it as a game.

444
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:13,275
The ones who devote their lives to it,
for the most part,

445
00:30:13,343 --> 00:30:15,777
insist it is a science.
It's neither.

446
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,172
Bobby Fischer
got underneath it

447
00:30:19,249 --> 00:30:20,841
Like no one before him

448
00:30:20,917 --> 00:30:22,851
and found at its center...

449
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:24,352
art.

450
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:27,856
I've spent my life
trying to play like him.

451
00:30:27,924 --> 00:30:30,620
Most of these guys have.

452
00:30:30,693 --> 00:30:32,320
But we're like forgers.

453
00:30:33,596 --> 00:30:35,154
We're competent fakes.

454
00:30:38,601 --> 00:30:40,694
His successor
wasn't here tonight.

455
00:30:43,106 --> 00:30:44,539
He wasn't here.

456
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:50,045
He's asleep in his room
in your house.

457
00:30:52,448 --> 00:30:54,575
Your son creates
like Fischer.

458
00:30:56,019 --> 00:30:58,544
He sees like him...

459
00:30:58,621 --> 00:31:00,088
inside.

460
00:31:00,156 --> 00:31:01,487
You can tell that

461
00:31:01,558 --> 00:31:04,152
by watching him
play some drunks in the park?

462
00:31:04,227 --> 00:31:05,751
Yes!

463
00:31:08,798 --> 00:31:11,995
You want to know
what I want?

464
00:31:12,068 --> 00:31:14,502
I'll tell you what I want.

465
00:31:14,571 --> 00:31:16,004
I want back

466
00:31:16,072 --> 00:31:19,371
what Bobby Fischer took with him
when he disappeared.

467
00:31:25,081 --> 00:31:26,514
Yeah, look at that.

468
00:31:29,752 --> 00:31:31,276
Oh!

469
00:31:35,592 --> 00:31:37,025
You're his father.

470
00:31:37,093 --> 00:31:38,720
It's your decision.

471
00:31:55,111 --> 00:31:56,203
Josh.

472
00:31:56,279 --> 00:31:59,305
I--I'd like you to meet
a friend of mine.

473
00:31:59,382 --> 00:32:00,314
Hi, Josh.

474
00:32:00,383 --> 00:32:01,941
This is Bruce.

475
00:32:02,018 --> 00:32:03,042
Hi.

476
00:32:06,055 --> 00:32:08,489
Well, I'll let
you two, um...

477
00:32:08,558 --> 00:32:09,991
I'll be downstairs.

478
00:32:52,602 --> 00:32:54,035
I love
water basketball.

479
00:32:54,103 --> 00:32:58,039
Well, supposedly, he used to, uh,
really be someone.

480
00:32:58,107 --> 00:33:01,042
Some sort of, uh...
master level...

481
00:33:02,211 --> 00:33:03,769
something or other.

482
00:33:03,846 --> 00:33:04,972
Used to.

483
00:33:05,048 --> 00:33:08,142
Well, yeah. Well,
he doesn't play anymore...

484
00:33:08,217 --> 00:33:09,809
on the circuit...

485
00:33:11,654 --> 00:33:14,680
or--or whatever, um...
they call it.

486
00:33:16,059 --> 00:33:17,492
Well, he's interesting.

487
00:33:32,575 --> 00:33:34,509
All right, this is it.

488
00:33:37,914 --> 00:33:40,382
Mr. Green
in the conservatory

489
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:41,883
with the candlestick.

490
00:33:46,789 --> 00:33:47,915
Wrench.

491
00:33:49,892 --> 00:33:52,861
Frère Jacques

492
00:33:52,929 --> 00:33:54,794
Frère Jacques

493
00:33:54,864 --> 00:33:57,025
Dormez-vous?

494
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,533
Dormez-vous?

495
00:33:58,601 --> 00:34:01,126
I need to talk
to your dad a minute.

496
00:34:01,204 --> 00:34:03,138
I'll see you
next week, O.K.?

497
00:34:03,206 --> 00:34:04,907
I really had
a great time, Josh.

498
00:34:04,907 --> 00:34:05,566
Me, too.

499
00:34:06,886 --> 00:34:07,716
Bye.

500
00:34:07,787 --> 00:34:08,913
Bye.

501
00:34:08,988 --> 00:34:11,923
The first lesson went
very well, I think.

502
00:34:11,991 --> 00:34:13,185
Oh, good.

503
00:34:15,494 --> 00:34:16,426
So, uh...

504
00:34:16,495 --> 00:34:18,258

I did not!
I scratched my ear!

See, you can call me
the man of many signals.

00:45:29,489 --> 00:45:30,421
Many signals.

Knock it off,
for Christ's sake.

684
00:45:32,492 --> 00:45:35,427
I don't want to "knock it off,
for Christ's sake."

I'm a man
of many signals.

Yeah, I pull
my nose, my elbow...

and whatever else
I want to pull.

You play the game fair.
That's the way it's played.

So...you see me
pulling my ear,

690
00:45:52,012 --> 00:45:53,536
it's not an itch.

691

You might think it's an itch,
but it's not an itch.

So watch for

I can hardly wait.

- Can I get you a sandwich?
- No, that's--

Petey just hung his rook!

710
00:48:05,278 --> 00:48:07,712
He probably sacrificed it
for position.

711
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:10,681
He's probably still got
the advantage.

In school,
before he dropped out,

716
00:49:33,967 --> 00:49:35,400
Bobby studied chess books

717
00:49:35,468 --> 00:49:38,096
while his teachers
taught other things.

718

When they told him
to put his books away,

719
00:49:42,622 --> 00:49:44,055
or took them away,

720
00:49:44,124 --> 00:49:46,058
he studied in his head.

721
00:49:46,126 --> 00:49:49,562
When a science report
came back to him once

722

"not satisfactory"

He was impressed

You've been taking him

It's important

That seems to be
all he can remember.

or the Lincoln Memorial.

And you're wondering
why that is.

786
00:53:17,406 --> 00:53:19,840
It's because I'm a rotten father.
You're right.

I drag him
all over the country

in his schoolwork?

He is,

791
00:53:28,350 --> 00:53:30,750
but I'm more concerned about
other things...

792

Like his

- There's a problem there?
- Possibly.

794
00:53:33,689 --> 00:53:36,123
Well, is there or isn't there?

795
00:53:36,192 --> 00:53:37,318
Mr. Waitzkin...

796
00:53:37,393 --> 00:53:39,884
I'm sure he's very good
at this chess thing,

797
00:53:39,962 --> 00:53:41,896
but that isn't
really the issue--

798
00:53:41,964 --> 00:53:42,896
Chess thing.

799
00:53:42,965 --> 00:53:43,897
I'm sorry?

800
00:53:43,966 --> 00:53:45,024
Chess thing.

801
00:53:45,101 --> 00:53:47,626
I'm sure he's good at it,
but I'm worried.

802
00:53:47,703 --> 00:53:49,136
To make an analogy--

803
00:53:49,205 --> 00:53:51,139

812
00:54:02,118 --> 00:54:03,710
She's comparing chess
to pinochle.

00:54:03,786 --> 00:54:06,220
What am I supposed
to say to that?

814
00:54:06,288 --> 00:54:08,222
She's trying
to make a point.

815
00:54:08,290 --> 00:54:09,723
Maybe we should listen.

816
00:54:09,792 --> 00:54:12,989
Vinnie thinks he's spending
too much time at it, too.

817
00:54:13,062 --> 00:54:15,462
Vinnie? Vinnie's a drug addict.

818
00:54:15,531 --> 00:54:18,091
I'm supposed to listen to his
opinion, too?

819
00:54:19,201 --> 00:54:20,793
I'm sorry,
but your analogy

820
00:54:20,870 --> 00:54:22,462
is a very bad one.

821
00:54:22,538 --> 00:54:25,098
If you want to make
a comparison to something,

822
00:54:25,174 --> 00:54:26,505
have it make sense.

823
00:54:26,575 --> 00:54:29,009
Compare it to math
or music or art,

824
00:54:29,078 --> 00:54:32,013
because otherwise it belittles him
and it and me.

825
00:54:32,081 --> 00:54:34,015
I don't mean
to belittle you--

826
00:54:34,083 --> 00:54:37,348
Oh, but you are,
even the way you're looking at me.

827
00:54:37,419 --> 00:54:39,353
Mr. Waitzkin,
I think perhaps--

828
00:54:39,421 --> 00:54:42,857
I'll tell you how good he is.
He's better at this

995
01:09:04,042 --> 01:09:06,977
and in order to do that,
he had to work,

996
01:09:07,045 --> 01:09:09,479
which is what
we're going to do.

997
01:09:09,547 --> 01:09:10,844
O.K.

998
01:09:10,915 --> 01:09:13,850
Promise you won't
argue moves with me,

999
01:09:13,918 --> 01:09:16,648
no matter how much
you think you're right.

1000
01:09:16,721 --> 01:09:17,813
I promise.

1001
01:09:17,889 --> 01:09:20,653
Everything I tell you
imagine is coming from him

1002
01:09:20,725 --> 01:09:23,159
because I know
every game he ever played,

1003
01:09:23,227 --> 01:09:26,162
so, in effect, he's going to be
teaching you,

1004
01:09:26,230 --> 01:09:27,891
and you'll become him.

1005
01:09:27,966 --> 01:09:28,898
Promise.

1006
01:09:28,967 --> 01:09:29,934
All right.

1007
01:09:31,002 --> 01:09:32,663
Some new rules--

1008
01:09:34,305 --> 01:09:36,068
no more speed chess.

1009
01:09:36,140 --> 01:09:39,576
I know you like it,
I know it's fun,

1010
01:09:39,644 --> 01:09:41,077
but it's no good.

1011
01:09:41,145 --> 01:09:44,512
It ruined Arbakov,
and it'll ruin you.

1012
01:09:44,582 --> 01:09:47,517
And no more games
in Washington Square.

1013
01:09:47,585 --> 01:09:51,180
They're patzers, and they're teaching
you all the wrong things.

1014
01:09:51,255 --> 01:09:53,553
They're not patzers.

1015
01:09:53,625 --> 01:09:54,717
They're losers,

1016
01:09:54,792 --> 01:09:58,057
and unless you want to end up
just like them,

1017
01:09:58,129 --> 01:09:59,721
you'll stay away.

1018
01:09:59,797 --> 01:10:02,357
They're not patzers.

1019
01:10:04,602 --> 01:10:06,661
I mean it.

1020
01:10:08,940 --> 01:10:09,872
Now...

1021
01:10:17,281 --> 01:10:18,646
which one is you?

1022
01:10:18,716 --> 01:10:20,946
What do you mean?

1023
01:10:21,019 --> 01:10:24,853
I mean, which one is you?

1024
01:10:24,922 --> 01:10:27,789
None of them.
They're just pieces.

1025
01:10:27,859 --> 01:10:29,793
This is you.

1026
01:10:49,514 --> 01:10:51,607
So what's your best move?

1027
01:10:51,683 --> 01:10:53,082
Rook to d 1 .

1028
01:10:53,151 --> 01:10:55,085
What about taking on e5?

1029
01:10:55,153 --> 01:10:56,586
What about it?

1030
01:10:56,654 --> 01:10:59,088
You didn't consider it.
You're still not considering it.

1031
01:10:59,157 --> 01:11:00,146
Sit up.

1032
01:11:00,224 --> 01:11:03,284
I'm right.
Rook to d 1 is the best move.

1033
01:11:03,361 --> 01:11:05,295
You didn't study the board.

1034
01:11:05,363 --> 01:11:07,593
You're moving
before I know the answers.

1035
01:11:07,665 --> 01:11:09,098
Give me your book.

1036
01:11:09,167 --> 01:11:10,691
Why?

1037
01:11:10,768 --> 01:11:13,134
Give me your book.

1038
01:11:13,204 --> 01:11:14,330
Why?

1039
01:11:14,405 --> 01:11:16,703
You just lost
some master-class points, tiger.

1040
01:11:16,774 --> 01:11:18,207
I can't lose points.

1041
01:11:18,276 --> 01:11:21,905
No? You just lost some more
for arguing with me.

1042
01:11:27,485 --> 01:11:29,453
Fine, Tim, it's not enough.

1043
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:30,452
What's happening?

1044
01:11:30,521 --> 01:11:31,715
What's happening?

1045
01:11:31,789 --> 01:11:35,418
I hear a whole lot of talk
and don't get much for it.

1046
01:11:35,493 --> 01:11:37,893
Ooh, it hurts!

1047
01:11:42,934 --> 01:11:43,992
Damn!

1048
01:11:46,838 --> 01:11:47,998
Damn!

1049
01:11:53,010 --> 01:11:55,205
Do you know what the word
contempt means?

1050
01:12:01,018 --> 01:12:05,182
It's to think of others
as being beneath you,

1051
01:12:05,256 --> 01:12:08,817
to be unworthy of being
in the same room with you.

1052
01:12:13,531 --> 01:12:15,999
I don't feel that.

1053
01:12:16,067 --> 01:12:18,661
Well, you better start.

1054
01:12:21,172 --> 01:12:24,107
Because if you don't think
it's a part of winning,

1055
01:12:24,175 --> 01:12:25,267
you're wrong.

1056
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:28,107
You have to have contempt
for your opponents.

1057
01:12:28,179 --> 01:12:29,612
You have to hate them.

1058
01:12:34,485 --> 01:12:36,578
But I don't.

1059
01:12:36,654 --> 01:12:38,815
They hate you.

1060
01:12:44,495 --> 01:12:46,053
They hate you, Josh.

1061
01:12:50,001 --> 01:12:51,935
I don't hate them.

1062
01:12:53,104 --> 01:12:56,938
Bobby Fischer held the world
in contempt.

1063
01:13:01,779 --> 01:13:03,644
I'm not him.

1064
01:13:13,324 --> 01:13:14,882
You're telling me.

1065
01:13:16,994 --> 01:13:18,393
In the primary division,

1066
01:13:18,462 --> 01:13:21,363
In first place with a perfect
six out of six--

1067
01:13:21,432 --> 01:13:23,195
Jonathan Poe.

1068
01:13:27,972 --> 01:13:30,907
Let's give a round of applause
for all the winners.

1069
01:13:40,985 --> 01:13:43,010
It's white's move.

1070
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:51,485
Can we expect it
any time soon?

1071
01:13:51,562 --> 01:13:53,792
How many points
is it worth?

1072
01:13:53,865 --> 01:13:55,628
To make the opening move?

1073
01:13:55,700 --> 01:13:56,997
Yes.

1074
01:13:57,068 --> 01:13:59,593
Forget the points.

1075
01:13:59,670 --> 01:14:02,332
How much is it worth
if I do it?

1076
01:14:02,406 --> 01:14:05,204
Do it for its own sake.

1077
01:14:05,276 --> 01:14:09,042
I want to know how close I am
to getting the certificate.

1078
01:14:09,113 --> 01:14:10,045
Forget that.

1079
01:14:10,114 --> 01:14:11,172
I want to know.

1080
01:14:11,249 --> 01:14:13,683
- I don't know.
- What do you mean?

1081
01:14:13,751 --> 01:14:15,150
I don't care.

1082
01:14:15,219 --> 01:14:18,188
I don't understand.

1083
01:14:18,256 --> 01:14:21,350
It's white's move.

1084
01:14:26,964 --> 01:14:28,522
I want the certificate.

1085
01:14:28,599 --> 01:14:30,032
You want the certificate?

1086
01:14:30,101 --> 01:14:32,535
You have to have
the certificate?

1087
01:14:32,603 --> 01:14:35,538
You won't move until you get
the certificate?

1088
01:14:35,606 --> 01:14:37,164
You win.

1089
01:14:37,241 --> 01:14:40,335
Here's your certificate.
Fill it out.

1090
01:14:41,879 --> 01:14:44,143
Doesn't mean anything.
It's a piece of paper.

1091
01:14:44,215 --> 01:14:46,649
It's a Xerox
of a piece of paper.

1092
01:14:46,717 --> 01:14:48,651
Do you want
another one?

1093
01:14:48,719 --> 01:14:50,243
Do you want 1 0?

1094
01:14:53,257 --> 01:14:54,485
You want 20?

1095
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:57,188
30?

1096
01:14:57,261 --> 01:15:00,253
I've got a briefcase full of them.
They mean nothing.

1097
01:15:06,237 --> 01:15:07,829
They mean nothing.

1098
01:15:13,110 --> 01:15:15,340
Get out of my house.

1099
01:15:34,031 --> 01:15:37,467
To put a child in a position
to care about winning

1100
01:15:37,535 --> 01:15:39,867
and not to prepare him
is wrong.

1101
01:15:39,937 --> 01:15:41,370
Get out of my house.

1102
01:15:59,991 --> 01:16:04,087
Look, I know you don't want to admit it,
but he's right.

1103
01:16:04,161 --> 01:16:07,597
I mean, you wouldn't sign your kid up
for little league

1104
01:16:07,665 --> 01:16:10,099
and then not get him
a glove.

1105
01:16:10,167 --> 01:16:11,600
You equip him.

1106
01:16:11,669 --> 01:16:12,601
It's over.

1107
01:16:12,670 --> 01:16:15,104
Bonnie, he's in a slump.

1108
01:16:15,172 --> 01:16:17,106
This is a slump.
It happens.

1109
01:16:17,174 --> 01:16:19,039
When you get into a slump,

1110
01:16:19,110 --> 01:16:22,045
you get out of it eventually.
You don't give up.

1111
01:16:22,113 --> 01:16:24,047
This is like baseball to you.

1112
01:16:24,115 --> 01:16:26,549
If you're afraid to lose,
you lose.

1113
01:16:26,617 --> 01:16:27,549
He's afraid.

1114
01:16:27,618 --> 01:16:30,314
He's not afraid
of losing.

1115
01:16:30,388 --> 01:16:31,980
He's afraid
of losing your love.

1116
01:16:32,056 --> 01:16:33,990
How many ballplayers
grow up

1117
01:16:34,058 --> 01:16:36,686
afraid of losing
their father's love

1118
01:16:36,761 --> 01:16:39,195
every time they come up
to the plate?

1119
01:16:39,263 --> 01:16:40,696
All of them!

1120
01:16:44,035 --> 01:16:46,469
He knows
you disapprove of him.

1121
01:16:46,537 --> 01:16:48,971
He knows you think
he's weak,

1122
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:51,133
but he's not weak.

1123
01:16:51,208 --> 01:16:53,199
He's decent.

1124
01:16:54,545 --> 01:16:56,979
And if you or Bruce
or anyone else

1125
01:16:57,048 --> 01:16:59,482
tries to beat that
out of him,

1126
01:16:59,550 --> 01:17:02,485
I swear to God
I'll take him away.

1127
01:17:06,290 --> 01:17:09,726
When did you start to get serious
about chess?

1128
01:17:09,794 --> 01:17:11,318
Uh, I got serious, oh...

1129
01:17:13,030 --> 01:17:15,863
hmm, oh, well, I was always
pretty serious about it.

1130
01:17:15,933 --> 01:17:18,993
You know,
when I was maybe 7.

1131
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:26,576
People say they've received letters
from him over the years,

1132
01:17:26,644 --> 01:17:29,238
but never show them.

1133
01:17:31,048 --> 01:17:33,482
They say
he lost his nerve,

1134
01:17:33,551 --> 01:17:36,645
and he'll never play
again.

1135
01:17:38,022 --> 01:17:40,456
They say
he lost his mind

1136
01:17:40,524 --> 01:17:43,960
and roams the streets
of Los Angeles hiding out

1137
01:17:44,028 --> 01:17:45,962
under assumed names.

1138
01:17:46,030 --> 01:17:46,962
Check.

1139
01:17:48,032 --> 01:17:49,021
Check.

1140
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:51,534
Some people say...

1141
01:17:53,170 --> 01:17:54,102
he's dead.

1142
01:17:56,540 --> 01:17:59,475
I think he's lying low
and getting stronger,

1143
01:17:59,543 --> 01:18:03,172
waiting for just the right
moment to come back

1144
01:18:03,247 --> 01:18:05,647
and reclaim his crown.

1145
01:18:33,244 --> 01:18:34,438
Hey, Josh.

1146
01:18:34,512 --> 01:18:35,638
Shh.

1147
01:18:40,974 --> 01:18:43,374
What happened
to your room?

1148
01:18:44,511 --> 01:18:46,069
I cleaned it.

1149
01:18:52,886 --> 01:18:54,319
Hey, you know,

1150
01:18:54,388 --> 01:18:57,323
you don't have to
do this anymore.

1151
01:18:57,391 --> 01:19:00,827
You could give it up,
and that's all right with me.

1152
01:19:07,534 --> 01:19:08,626
In fact...

1153
01:19:10,571 --> 01:19:12,300
I want you to.

1154
01:19:15,042 --> 01:19:16,976
How can I do that?

1155
01:19:17,044 --> 01:19:20,104
What do you mean?
You just do it.

1156
01:19:23,483 --> 01:19:25,747
But I have to win.

1157
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:29,955
No, that's what I'm saying--
you don't.

1158
01:19:30,023 --> 01:19:32,924
But you told me I did.

1159
01:19:32,993 --> 01:19:37,054
Well, I'm telling you now
that you don't.

1160
01:19:38,131 --> 01:19:39,928
But I do.

1161
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,594
I do.

1162
01:19:42,669 --> 01:19:43,601
Why?

1163
01:19:46,006 --> 01:19:47,940
Because I have to.

1164
01:19:50,510 --> 01:19:51,534
Why?

1165
01:19:51,612 --> 01:19:54,046
It doesn't
mean anything.

1166
01:19:54,114 --> 01:19:56,309
It's just a game.

1167
01:19:58,852 --> 01:20:00,479
No, it isn't.

1170
01:20:52,506 --> 01:20:53,996
Good morning.

1171
01:21:00,814 --> 01:21:02,406
These belong to you.

1172
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:35,107
Want to play?

1173

Two minutes.

01:21:48,562 --> 01:21:49,494
What's that?

1175
01:21:49,563 --> 01:21:50,530
Schleimann attack.

1176
01:21:50,597 --> 01:21:52,565
Where'd you learn that from,
a book?

1177
01:21:52,632 --> 01:21:54,031
My teacher taught me.

1178
01:21:54,101 --> 01:21:57,036
Forget it. Play like you used to--
from the gut.

1179
01:21:57,104 --> 01:21:59,538
Get your pawns rolling
on the queen's side.

1180
01:21:59,606 --> 01:22:02,040
Put it out.
Josh is playing.

1181
01:22:02,109 --> 01:22:05,044
He taught you how not to lose,
not how to win.

1182
01:22:05,112 --> 01:22:08,047
You got to risk losing.
You got to risk everything.

1183
01:22:08,115 --> 01:22:11,050
You got to go
to the edge of defeat.

1184
01:22:11,118 --> 01:22:12,050
But--

1185
01:22:12,119 --> 01:22:13,848
But what? Play.

1186
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:16,787
Never play the board,
always the man.

1187
01:22:16,857 --> 01:22:20,224
You got to play the man
playing the board. Play me.

1188
01:22:20,293 --> 01:22:22,727
You have to beat me,
not the board.

1189
01:22:22,796 --> 01:22:25,230
You're not
who I have to play.

1190
01:22:25,298 --> 01:22:26,959
You're playing me now.

1191
01:22:29,903 --> 01:22:32,201
Better.

1192
01:22:32,272 --> 01:22:33,899

Better! Yes!
Come on, move.

01:22:36,476 --> 01:22:38,137
Good!

1195
01:22:38,211 --> 01:22:39,508
Yeah!

1196

01:22:41,481 --> 01:22:42,880
Better!

1198
01:22:42,949 --> 01:22:44,576
Yeah!

1199
01:22:45,752 --> 01:22:47,549
Good move!

1200
01:22:47,621 --> 01:22:48,918
Yeah!

1201
01:22:48,989 --> 01:22:51,150
Yeah! Uh-huh!

1202
01:22:51,224 --> 01:22:52,350
Yes!

1203
01:22:52,426 --> 01:22:53,654

Good, good, good! Move!

Ooh, good! Yeah!

Well, he's good.
Sit down.

Still planning on going to Chicago
for the nationals?

01:23:46,413 --> 01:23:47,345
Yeah.

1216
01:23:47,414 --> 01:23:49,541
I've seen you both
at the park.

1217
01:23:49,616 --> 01:23:52,676
Yeah. We've been
hanging out there a lot.

1218
01:23:52,752 --> 01:23:54,743
Think that's a good idea?

1219
01:23:56,356 --> 01:23:57,789
Yes, I do.

1220
01:23:57,858 --> 01:24:00,326
He's playing better than ever.

1221
01:24:00,393 --> 01:24:02,190
How would you know that?

1222
01:24:06,633 --> 01:24:07,600
You're right.

1223
01:24:07,667 --> 01:24:10,329
I--I don't know.

1224
01:24:10,403 --> 01:24:14,271
But what I do know
is that he likes playing again

1225
01:24:14,341 --> 01:24:17,139
for the first time
in a long time.

1226
01:24:17,210 --> 01:24:19,371
I know you think
you're doing what's best,

1227
01:24:19,446 --> 01:24:23,439
but you're setting him up for
the biggest disappointment of his life.

1228
01:24:23,517 --> 01:24:26,418
That other kid isn't
spending his afternoons riding bikes

1229
01:24:26,486 --> 01:24:29,148
and playing Pac-Man,
I can guarantee you that.

1230
01:24:29,222 --> 01:24:31,156
I'm doing the only thing

1231
01:24:31,224 --> 01:24:33,818
I know how to do
for Josh.

1232
01:24:33,894 --> 01:24:36,226
I don't know
what else to do.

1233
01:24:36,296 --> 01:24:39,288
Don't let him
go down there to lose.

1234
01:24:43,003 --> 01:24:46,131
That's what you can do
for him.

1235
01:24:46,206 --> 01:24:47,571
You're his father.
Forbid it.

1236
01:24:47,641 --> 01:24:49,666
I can't do that.

1237
01:24:49,743 --> 01:24:50,767
Fred...

1238
01:24:50,844 --> 01:24:52,175
he's going to get killed.

1239
01:24:52,245 --> 01:24:54,873
There's not going to be
much left of him.

1240
01:24:54,948 --> 01:25:00,386
You have no idea what a fall like this
can do to you.

1241
01:25:00,453 --> 01:25:02,978
I think I do.

1242
01:25:06,927 --> 01:25:10,556
You know what?

1243
01:25:10,630 --> 01:25:12,928
You should come down
with us.

1244
01:25:12,999 --> 01:25:17,368
It would mean a lot to him to have
you there.

1245
01:25:19,306 --> 01:25:21,399
That I can't do.

1246
01:25:45,065 --> 01:25:46,726
There you go.

1247
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:47,858
Thank you.

1248
01:25:47,934 --> 01:25:49,595
Thanks.

1249
01:25:49,669 --> 01:25:51,500
Come on, Katya.

1250
01:25:58,078 --> 01:26:01,309

but that's not right, O.K.?

That's not
what Casablanca did.

1252
01:26:02,849 --> 01:26:04,339
See?
You want to be patient.

1253
01:26:04,417 --> 01:26:05,748
Fools rush in.

1254
01:26:05,819 --> 01:26:08,151
You want to go
to the 7th rank--

1255
01:26:08,221 --> 01:26:09,813
Hi, Morgan.

1256
01:26:09,889 --> 01:26:12,255
Josh, where you been?

1257
01:26:12,325 --> 01:26:13,849
Fishing.

1258
01:26:13,927 --> 01:26:17,021
Whoa. Look at this.

1259
01:26:17,097 --> 01:26:20,794
No chess boards,
no chess books.

1260
01:26:20,867 --> 01:26:24,030
I wasn't allowed to talk about chess
for two whole weeks.

1261
01:26:24,104 --> 01:26:25,833
Just fish.

1262
01:26:25,905 --> 01:26:26,872
Whoa.

1263
01:26:26,940 --> 01:26:28,878
It was my dad's idea.

1264
01:26:29,012 --> 01:26:30,741
Hey, Kalev.

1265
01:26:30,814 --> 01:26:32,975
How's it going?

1266
01:26:33,049 --> 01:26:34,073
Fishing?

1267
01:26:34,150 --> 01:26:36,209
Sure.

1268
01:26:41,558 --> 01:26:44,425
The 200 young players
finding their seats behind me

1269
01:26:44,494 --> 01:26:47,554
represent some
of the strongest chess minds

1270
01:26:47,630 --> 01:26:49,564
of any age in the country.

1271
01:26:49,632 --> 01:26:53,090
Traveling from as far away
as Alaska and Hawaii,

1272
01:26:53,169 --> 01:26:55,660
they've come here to compete
against each other

1273
01:26:55,738 --> 01:26:58,400
over the course of the next two long,
grueling days.

To become champion,

one must win

1280
01:27:08,384 --> 01:27:11,285
is the next Bobby Fischer
somewhere in this room?

1281
01:27:11,354 --> 01:27:12,343
Hi, Mom.

1282
01:27:28,037 --> 01:27:30,938
This girl you're playing
is ranked 82nd.

1283
01:27:31,007 --> 01:27:33,100
All right.
Get through it quick,

1284
01:27:33,176 --> 01:27:35,974
and you can rest
before the next round, O.K.?

1285
01:27:36,045 --> 01:27:37,103
O.K.

1286
01:27:37,180 --> 01:27:39,876
I'll see you
in a little while.

1287
01:27:39,949 --> 01:27:40,881
Bye.

1288
01:27:40,950 --> 01:27:42,918

Josh...

1290
01:27:46,289 --> 01:27:47,654
good luck.

1291
01:27:52,095 --> 01:27:56,725
Some of you maybe unfamiliar
with sudden death rules.

1292
01:27:56,799 --> 01:28:01,099
If you're writing moves down
while a player gets down

1293
01:28:01,170 --> 01:28:05,698
to where there's less
than five minutes left,

1294
01:28:05,775 --> 01:28:09,142
it's no longer
your responsibility to...

1295
01:28:09,212 --> 01:28:10,144
Hi.

1296
01:28:10,213 --> 01:28:11,805
Hi.

1297
01:28:11,881 --> 01:28:13,974
Is that clear?

1298
01:28:14,050 --> 01:28:15,278
Good luck.

1299
01:28:15,351 --> 01:28:16,716
One more thing--

1300
01:28:16,786 --> 01:28:18,344
if you have a problem...

1301
01:28:18,421 --> 01:28:19,718
Morgan.

1302
01:28:19,789 --> 01:28:22,986
If you have a problem,
you don't have to discuss it

1303
01:28:23,059 --> 01:28:24,424
with your opponent.

1304
01:28:24,494 --> 01:28:27,327
All these people
with purple hats around here,

1305
01:28:27,397 --> 01:28:29,160
they'll be wandering around.

1306
01:28:29,232 --> 01:28:32,167
Just put your hand up,
and they'll straighten it up.

1307
01:28:32,235 --> 01:28:35,261
O.K. Just hold up your hand,
and they'll see it.

1308
01:28:35,338 --> 01:28:38,398
Don't argue
with your opponent.

1309
01:28:38,474 --> 01:28:39,702
That's ridiculous.

1310
01:28:39,776 --> 01:28:41,209
O.K. good luck.

1311
01:28:41,277 --> 01:28:42,744
Start your clocks.

1312
01:30:34,490 --> 01:30:36,458
Can I come in?

1313
01:30:56,079 --> 01:30:57,774
How are you feeling?

1314
01:31:02,085 --> 01:31:03,643
Scared?

1315
01:31:05,288 --> 01:31:07,586
I can't beat him.

1316
01:31:10,226 --> 01:31:11,659
You might be right.

1317
01:31:11,728 --> 01:31:14,162
I'm not supposed

Don't take back
